V-Pitt Town Meeting
Hears Talk Today

Franklin D. Roosevelt’ and
‘Nendell L. ‘Willkie, presidential
candidates, will be previewed
today as 4 prospective presidents
of the United States by.Louis
‘N. H. .Johnst0n,v instructor .in
political. science, at the Pitt Town
Meeting in 244 Cathedral at 2:30
o’clock.’

Dr. Pierre Cot, former French
minister of commerce and a refugee
from the French trials of
guilty” leaders, will also speak at

the. Wednesday Town. Meeting,
scheduled for 1:30 o’clock in 244
Cathedral. - '

Speaking on the subject “Evading
the Mud.” Mr. Johnston will present
a non-partisan discussion “in the
spirit but not with the skill of an
expert.”

Non-Partisan, Non-Personal

“From a non—partisan, non-per-
sonal poin.t of view,” explained Mr.
Johnston, a Yale graduate, “I will

try to discuss what a vote for Roose- V

velt or Willkie will mean, as far as
it can be measured in advance.”

Since it is assumed that third
party candidates will not win. they
will not be discussed, he revealed.

As the subject indicates, the dis-
cussion will not present party claims
and promises, but '-will reveal the
facts of the present presidential is-
sues.

Dr. Cot, who taught at the Uni-
versity of Reenes, will speak Thurs-
day evening at Hotel Webster Hall
on “The Collapse of France and Its
Lessons for America” at a dinner
discussion given by the Foreign Pol-
icy association. _

Forum Follows Meet , .

The former French official played
an important role in international
politics for 12' years variously as
member of the French parliament,
undersecretary of state, minister of
aviation, and French -delegate to

various international conferences.  .

“Dr. Cot is doubly an- expert on
political science—an instructor and
student, as well as a participant in
politics, international and national,
stated Fred Robie, Ed41, who shares
direction of the Town Meeting with
Esther Marcuson, C41.

An open forum in which students
may informally discuss the ques-
tion with the speaker, will be held
after the speeches.

Survey Shows A
Roosevelt Win

Pitt Students Give
FDR 53.3 Per Cent

Franklin Delano Roosevelt has a
slight lead in popularity among
University students, if a cross-sec-
tion poll of -2G0'students conducted
by the News is any criterion.

The survey discloses that a six
per cent lead is maintained by the
Presidentover the republican can-
didate on the question of the stu-
dent’=s preference in the campaign.

Asked whom they thought would
win next Tuesday, the students con-
ceded a three-to-one victory .for
President Roosevelt.

Roth Reports Steady Advance
Of Willkie Strength on Campus

By Horace Umberger

Pitt campus’ Willkie-for President
club has gone into high gear in the
ﬁnal week before election.

That’s the word given us by Fred
Roth, Ed41, chairman of the club,
who emphatically states that he was
pleased with the sign of Willkie
strength in the University and that
efficient work is being done by the
entire club.

Roth pointed out that the organ-
ization seeks not only to convert
the independent and Democratic
vote, but also to cooperate with sim-
ilar clubs in four other Allegheny
county colleges. These are Mt.
Mercy, Duquesne, Carnegie Tech,
and PCW. All these clubs received
their charters from the Allegheny
County Associated Willkie clubs, a
branch of the national organization
founded by Oren Root.

A mass meeting of all Willkie
clubs is scheduled for this evening
at Falk Training school. Speeches
and entertainment begin at 8:30
o’clock. Earlier at 5 o’clock a rally
will be held for club chairmen at
the Oliver building, room 2527.

“Although no faculty members
have signed for the Willkie club,
many are lending their support and

giving impartial advice,” Roth said.
He believes that the “bandwagon
drive,” coming down the home
stretch, has had as contagious an
effect on the University campus as
it has had on the whole nation. The
Willkie club on campus is not a
temporary organization but hopes
to continue after the election,”
Roth pointed out.

An indication of the club’s pres-
ent membership can be judged by
the fact that over 400 buttons have
been distributed in school, Roth
stated. Several Democratic sup-
porters have expressed surprise at
the number of wearers, he contin-
ued.

The organization has done special
work with the Oakland Willkie club
whose chairman is Roddy Marshall.
“Willkie will win,” says Roth,
“but not by an overwhelming ma-
jority.” He urges members to in-
fluence their Democratic friends
with an appeal to the intellectual
side of the question. “Non-regis-
tered members should work twice
as hard since they cannot vote,” he
said. -

Wi1lkie’s son will not attend to-
night’s rally because of a slight at-
tack of tonsilitis, according to Roth.

Perkins Talks
On New Deal

Aims at Forum

Secretary of Labor Francis Perk-
ins comes to the Pittsburgh Com-
munity forum tonight at 8:15 o’clock
in Schenley High school auditorium
to discuss “The Aims and Accom-
plishments of the New Deal.”

,Miss Perkins and her department
have been a center of controversy
since her appointment in March,
1933, as the ﬁrst woman to serve in
the Cabinet. Her administration

has been marked by the formation‘

of the Congress of Industrial Or-
gan’zation by John L. Lewis, and
other labor leaders, and by the
passage of the Wagner Labor Rela-
tions act.

Criticism has been levelled at the
secretary for her failure to show a
“strong hand’_’ in several disputes,
notably the “Little Steel” strike of
1936, and, moreirecently, the con-
troversy 0ver_' deportation of Harry

, Bridges, West Coast l.abor leader.

A native of Boston, Miss Perkins
studied at the University of Penn-
sylvania and received her master’s
degree at Columbia university.
During 1919-21 she served‘ as Di-
rector of Investigations of the New
York State Fabtory commission. She
was chairman of President Roose-
velt’s Committee on Economic Se-
curity in 1934.

.At various times she has served
as a director of the American Child
Hygiene association, Consumers’
league and the New York Child La-
bor committee. In 1933 she was
awarded a medal for “Eminent
Achievement” by the American
Women’s association.

‘Internal Forces Are Danger,’

Walters Tells Phi Beta Kappa

By Irwin Rosen

Declaring that our American her-
itage of freedom is less likely to fall
before hostile forces from without
than from timorous, apathetic forces
from within our borders, Dr. Ray-
mond Walters. president of the Uni-
versity of Cincinnati, lauded Phi
Beta Kappa as a “provider of train-
ing and a sense of discrimination
necessary to good American leader-
ship” at a dinner meeting of that
organization in the Faculty club last
Friday evening.

Dr. Walters also told his listeners
that issues deeper than a different
division of “green and pink and
brown areas on the map of Europe”
were major forces in the present
war. He said that this conﬂict is a
milestone in the age-old problem of
the rigid Spartan, “all for the state”
tendency of government as against
the supremacy of the individual, his
rights, and his unmolested and en-
muraged development. “The fun-
damental concept of democracy as
opposed to totalitarianism,” D.r
Walters said, “is the intense belief
in the individual worth of the hu-
mrm soul.”

“Phi Beta Kappa has, by the very
nature of its organization,” said Dr.

Walters, “the obligation of pro-
claiming the protective strength of
liberal education and disinterested

miriositv to which our democracy
is devoted.

“It is this same disinterested cu-
riositv that creates ‘role-rance. an un-
derstanding of schools of thought
other than our own. and religions
other than our own.”

Dr. Walters concluded his address
with 2: nlea for action in the de-
fewer: of American principles. He

that man cannot yet drop the bur-
den of arms and the folly of war.

“It is now necessary to discard
our illusions. VVe now realize that
there is no peace for defenseless an-
tions of good will when on the same
planet there are highlv-armed na-
tions of such will as the aggressor
in the present war. We must con-

The New Amendment
And Party Politics

-The “Hoeveler” amendment
a_g_a,in.

‘ As you know, this is a proposal which provides

for election of SFA officers by the executive com-

is in the news

.t,ni-ttee rather than by the whole assembly which now

has the honor. At the moment, the proposed amend-
ment is in the hands of a connnittee. .

it -This editorial will not take issue either for or
against the amendment; a later writing will do that.
At the moment we are more concerned with the un-
._hea,lthy atmosphere that has surrounded the career
of the amendment thus far.

The amendment was introduced, objected to, and
discussed in a purely partisan spirit; fraternity men
and women oppose the amendment; independents
are pushing it.

Both factions are working purely for selﬁsh rea-
sons. Despite any argument that either side ad-
wv_oca~tes, the core of the whole thing is politics, petty
_st_udei1t politics, or as friend Jack Benny would say,
‘i»~“,p_-ule.1~ile and banal.”

We use this latter description, because the
chosen student representatives in SFA are forget-
.ti_n__g one thing: Tliey are legislators for the under-
graduate student body. They are charged with the
,pro.tection and administration of student affairs,
s,uc,h as they are. The activity leaders, who do
‘ma-ke up this assembly, are forgetting that they are
not representing a fraternity on the student gov-
e,rninent floor; they are not representing an inde-
‘pendent “ward.” 'l‘hey are representing student
_ii_it€‘rests, as a whole.

We are awaiting a sensible consideration of the
a.(uen'd1nent and expect the coniinittee to present a
r.epo’rt untainted by campus political.

Majority Fears American“ Entrance into War

Though Only 17 Per Cent Really Want to Fight

By Edgar Beige]
Although Dr. George Gallup re-
ports that only 17 per cent of our
people actually want to go to war,
private polls will reveal to anyone
that a majority of our people think
that the United States will be at
war soon—“somehow, somewhere.”
Last June University professors
-were . freely predicting to their
classes that “if war is still going on
a year from now (June, 1941). we
will be sin it.” That’s just about
eight months from now. The U. S.
entered the».-F last war only ﬁve
months aften-the people re-elected
the President who had kept us out
of war.
War Not Party Issue . -
However, the record shows that
men of all parties were victims of
the last war. When the violent act
of war is decided by the people and
their Congress, the issue is not one
of party politics. And when the
President announces American foi-
eign policy in a speech as political
leader of his party, we must not
forget he is also responsibly speak-
ing as the President. -~ \,
The American public is only part-
ly concerned, and is not very ex-
tensively involved, if the U. S. aids
Great Britain with a limit “short
of war.” However, the charge of
responsible news service writers
that this country is “now at war”
are untrue. And for the same of
those who, at the outbreak of the
next war. will examine the record

to see what we did “last time,” as ’

well as for those who will vote for
a President one week from tomor-
row, the official record of the Presi-
dent as head of the government
should be realized.

In his defense message to Con-

gress last July 10, the President
said “that we will not send our
men to take part in European wars.
But, we will repel aggression against
the United States or the western
hemisphere.”

The Reynaud Letter

This policy was made .an act of
Congress on September 12, when
section 3E of the Conscription bill
was ratiﬁed, declaring that “per-
sons inducted into the land forces
of the U. S. under this act shall not
be employed beyond the limits of
the western hemisphere except in
the territories and possessions of the
U. S., including the Philippine Is-
lands.”

This policy was established dip-
lomatically on‘June 16 when the
President, writing Premier Reynaud,
promising military supplies for
France, added‘ that “these state-
ments carry with them no implica-
tion of military’ commitments. Only
the Congress can make such com-
mitments.”

For those who still think the war
issue is purely a matter of politics,
the only political statement the
President has offered was in his
speech last week, declaring “we
will not participate in foreign wars
and we will not send our Army,
Navy, or Air force to ﬁght in for-
eign lands outside the Americas ex-
cept in case of attack.”

Examine the Record

All of these declarations make an
imposing record. And every Uni-
versity student who is a potential
conscript should be aware of this
record, and of the details of Amer-
ican foreign relations that will be
printed in the U. S. press during the
coming winter. The only loophole

“La Calumnia, a masterpiece of

objectors -

 

in all of these declarations is the
word“ “attack” or “aggression,”
against -the U. S. -

Already the U. S. has formally
protested bombing of American-
owned and American-operated oil
facilities in the vicinity of the Suez
canal. And within the next month

‘ the U. S. will send two squadrons of

“combat,” not training, planes to
the Philippines. Under his powers
as commander-in-chief, the Presi-
dent--whatever his name is—can
manipulate the armedgforces to im-
plicate the U. S. in inviting foreign

“aggression” on the Americas. .

Students, Should be Alert

University students, especially,
should adopt an attitude of alert-
ness to all the regions of the world
during the next few months, when
military operations will reach a
climax on all fronts, and their re-
lationship to American politics and
action. Future American policy was
suggested by Raymond Clapper as
early as September 6, when he de-
clared that “our role is to
help save what can be saved of the
British empire and bring it in re-
ality, although not in form, within
our orbit. To do that we must
assist the British to hold out so
that they can preserve their power

. To talk of sending an army
to Europe is meaningless. Where
would it ﬁght?”

Mr. Clapper forgets that if the
first policy was carried out, and
British gain the upper hand, then
the new AEF could help the BEF
wipe the Gestapo off the continent,

-similar to the campaign against the

Kaiser's reichswehr during 1917-
1918, when Americans of all parties
were killed.

Editor’s Note: For some time we have been feuding
with Pittpourrist Dick, the marshal, over the spelling
of his name. We have insisted that it is spelled Harmon;
he has claimed that it’s Harman. Without acknowl-
edging the validity Of his case and merely to keep Har-
mon-y in our big happy News family, as we are wont
to call it, we shall in the future spell Dick’s name in
accordance with his wishes; at least there is no Harm’n

  . Bewailing ‘Down with

Capitalism’ Talk

_ By Robert Hamilton

This is (1 Denunciation

Most of the things that will be said below have been
said before, but I want to get them off my chest. In
short, I am letting off a little personal steam.

I am blowing off against those gentlmen (euphem-
ism) who bray forth such slogans as “Down with
capitalists,’ “barefoot Wall Street boys,” etc. I am
also warning them.

First let me call attention to the fact that human
progress has gone on thusly; some one man has had
more vision, foresight, etc., than his fellow, and in-
vented something, or manufactured something, or
painted something. Immediately he has set a mark
for the rest of the race to shoot at,.and gradually the
entire race achieves the goal. Men have moved ‘for-
ward.

Next let me point out that downing anything is
necessarily a leveling process, not a building one, tend-
ing to restrict and cramp, in short, a curb on these lit-
tle spurts into the darkness that constitute human
progress- . _ - .

Thirdly, when one champions the cause of labor as
the controlling element in a democracy one also-, by
inference, supports the rule of the ignorant. It is a
regrettable, but generally accepted,‘ fact, that the la-
boring, men as a whole are the least educated, the
most prejudiced, and the least capable of self-control.
-I,t_,is_here.that my warning comes in. The selﬁsh poli-
ticians who are using the labor element for their ends
are playing with dynamite.

Even in a democracy

it is necessary for the people to be guided by certain
individuals of wisdom beyond the ordinary, possessed
of specialized skills. -It is not difficult to see that a
president shouldibe above petty personal animosities.
It is not diﬁicult to see that a meat-packer and soap-
maker is not a suitable ambassador. It is not difﬁcult
to understand that a member of a highly prejudiced

-group givento terrorism should not be made a mem-

bcrof the United States Supreme court. It is a plain
statement of fact that a college g:'adue.te is, 0' her things
being equal, better fitted for anything from ditch-
di.9§§’Ii!1§£ 50 1”\1‘-”—Y‘»iY1g‘ a company than is a liigh-school or
grade-school roan,  because he has been trained
to bring a cool, intclhgent, objective attitude to bear

upon his underto.l:in::s, bolstered by his specialized
tra.inin;:.{ in some cases.
it  310:5‘ 
to shout “z:lo*.vii” witli some-thing. With the human

race, as with cattle on the inarch, there will always be
laggarcls, a few leaders, and many in tlie rnass, jockey-
ing for position. And as with cattle you cannot get
your laggards and the mass ahead by stopping the
leaders. Instead you must urge on the rear. Force it
forward. The solution of present-day problems de-
pends on the education of the masses, which is neces-
sarily slow, not in the checking of the leaders in all
lines who, although so far above the generality, are
nevertheless doing the most for them.

The other view is a monumental fallacy of shock-
ing implications if one thinks that it is really be-
lieved by those toiwhose lips it comes so easily. A

-city was never built by leveling“ itstallest buildings.

from A the

Sidelines

With Bill McElwain
Sports Editor

It’s about time sports __writers quit beating around the bush and
being over-polite in the matter of ignoring dirty play in athletics.
We have particular reference to d.irty football teams, although

theﬁeld could be expanded without trouble.

Any’ sports writer,

if you get to know him well enough, will-tell you that there are
clean football teams and dirty football teams and that, year after

year, the clean ones are consistently clean and the dirty ones

sistently dirty.

Yet such are the peculiar ethics of the professional sports writer
and such is his fear of offending either the college bigwigs-‘5"or'
that mysterious force known as the “reading public” tha'tE‘he
would never put his knowledge» of plain, rotten ta.ctics_into print.

Some Clubs Consistently Clean

Consequently, the oﬁenders go on offending and the censure
of the press box never gets past _the stadium exit. The published
reports of a certain number of games each Saturday come as close
to being bold-faced lies as anything we care to see. Giving a team
credit for ﬁne play when you know that it got away with next to
murder is not our idea of objective journalism.

There are teams that are consistently clean—l\-lissouri, South-
ern Methodist, Duke, Carnegie Tech, to name a few on the Pitt

schedule.

There are others, many of whom have been or are Pitt
opponents, that are consistently guilty of foul tactics.

But‘ in the

eye of the “unbiased, unprejudiced” professional sports writer,
all these teams are equal and what goes on behind the oﬂicials’

backs is strictly nobody ’s business.

You may say, “But if these teams break the rules, why aren’t

know that a team coached in the fundamentals of dirty play can

they penalized?”

\Ve do

cover their actions so that oﬂicials may miss the infraction‘; we

rumors in some cases.

also know that the rumors of “home town” officials are more than
_A “home town” official conveniently sees
little of what the home team does; luckily, there aren’t as many
‘of them as might be imagined.

I’ C ollegians’ ‘ H ands Tied

We admit that it is‘"quit‘e true that we, as well as many _otl._1_er7

college writers, may be and often’ are inﬂuenced by personal in-'

terest in our school team. And for that very reason it is .i-rnpossible V
for a. collegian to get very speciﬁc in criticism of opposition ,eleven,s.'- , 1
He runs the risk of either calling the kettle black, if he‘; is blind 3

to his own eleven ’s misdoings, or of being charged  ,He
may be accused of deliberate falsiﬁcation. . ‘V in I I 

Thus, the only hope for completeunveiling of the sham sur-

rounding collegiate “sportsm.anship'-’i’.," is the professional, daily
paper, sports writer. He boasts of his'_‘__jdeta'.'chm'ent fron1 -the geﬁ-
eral collegiate scene. He, if anyone c‘a'n'be, should be objective
and uninﬂuenced by school atﬁliation. K.-.;Tl_1at the average writer is

of the journalistic profession.

Both clubs got off some long runs
but none of them ﬁgured in the di-

their touchdown on, a long pass
while the Panthers rang the bell

Smith’sPass

By Sheme ~ Baziellﬁ A C’  A

In lhé first Of a proposed series
of freshman. intra-squad football
games, theWhites defeated the

Blues in“ a closely fought, contest,_

6 to 0. Scatton, quarterback for the
Whites captained‘ his 'team_ while
Economos, ‘signal: caller for the
Blues, did likewise. ‘ ' I

The lone score of the game came»

in the early. moments of the»:-first
quarter when Smith, standing on the
B1ue’s 15-yard line, heaved one to
Gestner, standing in- the end zone.
Immediately following .=the"’"kicl<-oﬁ,
Ed Skladany, playing at "the hall‘-
back spot for the Whites, moved
the ball deep in enemy territory on
end sweeps. A ﬁve-yard pl.un,~;‘e oif
tacl~:.le and an off-side penzzliy
against the Blues set the stage for
the sco:-sing puss. ’1‘he, conversion
ottcinpt failed.

From this point, on, good defen-

Engineering League Contests Dominate

Second Week of Intramural Competition
0 Kappa Sigs, Phi Kaps, Sammies

Chemical Engineer Juniors Try

For Upset Victory over Oil & Gas

Engineering league games feature
the intramural league’s second week

of competition with two of the en-'

gineers’ pre-season favorites en-
gaged in major contests today.

The ﬁrst crucial contest for a

favorite is today's tilt between Oil
& Gas and the Chemical Engineer
Juniors on ﬁeld 1 at 4 o’clock. The
favored Oil & Gas team will have
to shoot the works in order to beat
the up and coming CE Juniors. The
Chem Engineers have always been
strong in man power, and the re-
sult may be a surprise.

Civil Engineer-Electrical Engi-
neers B on ﬁeld 2 at 4 o’clock is
another top contest between a good
veteran team of last year and a
team partially made up of un-
knowns. The few veterans that the
Electrical team have should be
enough to offer plenty of stiff com-
petition.

Engineering teams have a habit
of making all games closely _con-
tested with low scores. In this cir-
cuit no matter how strong a favor-
ite may appear, the underdog usu-
ally has an even chance of winning.

Tomorrow is the second day of
what appears to be the ﬁnest Greek
race in years.

The surprising Phi Gamma Delta
team, which had been considered
all but out of the race, seems to
have caught new life with Mike
Mitchell as the spearhead of the
attack, and will be favorites over
Sigma Alpha Epsilon.

The Fijis have one victory to
show thus far this season, that over
the supposedly invincible Phi Kap
team. The SAE team drew a bye
in the ﬁrst round and has not as yet

played a game. The two clubs bat-
tle on ﬁeld 2 at 4 o’clock.

Sigma Alpha Mu, victors over

the Pi Lams, will oppose the dark

horse Pi Kappa Alpha team on ﬁeld
1 at 4 o’clock. Red Silverman and
Artie Hurwitz should again bethe
outstanding men for the Sammie
team, against PiKA veteran Gus
Wilde and brother. “

Phi Epsilon Pi’s ﬁne showing last
week, when they triumphed over
the Phi Delts, is enough to give them
the nod over the Delts in tomor-
row’s game at 5 o’clock on ﬁeld 2.
Delta Tau Delta drew a bye in the
opening round selections, and has
had no chance to show its wares.

The Lambda Chi Alpha-Kappa
Sigma contest is the closest matched
game of the day. Both teams are
similar in their offensive play and
employ the same defense. The
Lambda Chi’s were the surprise

. team of last week when they came

back from their year of athletic in-
activity to defeat Theta Chi. The
game is a toss up and will be played
on ﬁeld 1 at 4 o’clock.

Theta ‘Chi and Sigma Chi play on .

the ﬁeld 1 at 3 o’clock, and it means
the road‘s end for one of them.
Each has one defeat, needing only
one more for elimination from the
race.

  WAA Jottings

By Harriet Harris

Horses will lbfe the vogue. this-ii‘ ball, and archery so that they can

H'allowie’evni when the members of
WAA take to‘.the'_wide” open spaces
to celebrate. The traditional broom
will have to take itsplace beside the

. outmoded covered wagons, electric

cars, and buggies of bygone days. ‘

All University women are invited
to attend the affair which is being
held at the Fox Chapel -riding acad-
emy on Thursday.

Rumor has it that WAA is about
to start an intramural athletic pro-
gram for all classes in the Univer-
sity. We think it would be a good
idea if all the promising women
athletes got together teams and.
practiced a little volleyball, basket-

be in the running if the plan goes
through. 

Competition would be run be-
tween classes and a possible system
of awards has A been mentioned.
Every Pitt woman should be inter-
ested in taking part in these tour-
naments. May the best team win!

 Score Opening‘Day Triumphs

Bob Lesko’s Kappa Sigma seven
popped the lid off the Fraternity
touch football season with a vic-
tory over a gallant Theta Chi team,
19-6, last Thursday.

The ﬁrst score of the game came
about when Dick Clark, a stand-out
on defense all afternoon, recovered
a Kappa Sigma fumble over the goal
line. Shortly afterward Melvin
Howe dashed 40 yards around left
end‘— into pay dirt to knot the count.
Bobs Crawford then threw a long
pass to pledge Coons, who was
downed on the two yard line, and
followed with a fourth, down ﬂing
to Coons for the winning marker.
The last tally was made by Stewart
on an interception of Walker's
aerial from 20 yards out.

Phi Epsilon Pi’s Wally Hirsch did
all that was expected of him and
more, but it was little Alex Zelen-
ski who showed the way to victory
over Phi Delta Theta, 12-0.

Zelenski played only a little more
than one half, but during that time
he intercepted four passes and
scored one touchdown, on a pass
from the all-intramural Hirsch. For
the ﬁnal six points Hirsch ran deep
to his left, turned quickly, and
heaved a long pass to Jim Deutel-
baum over the goal.

The ﬁnal game of the day proved
conclusively that the Phi Gams had
suffered no serious loss from gradu-
ation as they beat the Phi Kaps,
20-6.

Phi Gam’s Mike Mitchell proved
himself equal to last year’s pass-
ing sensation Chris Watson as he
passed for two touchdowns, one to
Warne and the other to Mansﬁeld.
Warne and Updegraff scored the
extra points on passes. “Stoney”
Bitner dashed 50 yards around right
end for a third tally. A

The lone Phi Kappa tally came
in the..late- minutes, when Jack
Glenn, whose .passes‘ knocked on

the. Fiji goal line continually, tossed

to Artman in "the; coveted ,.-territory.

In another feature of the day a
highly-favored Pi Lambda Phiseven
was upset by Sigma.Alpha Mu, 1-3-0,
after a scoreless ﬁrst half.

Early in the second half, Joe
,Aaron’s booming punt put the Pi
Lam’.s back on their own goal line.
On the exchange of punts, the Sam-

fmies "gained considerable yardage
and .'set. up their ﬁrst scoring play, ,

which‘.ca'me' on a pass from Artie
Hurwitz to “Big Red” Silverman,
standing in the end zone. Morrie
Mayer’s drop-kick made thescore
7-0.

A few plays later, Hurwitz in- V ‘

terceptedeone of» Larry Katz’s long
passes and streaked down the side-
line to score. The conversion failed
and the score read 13-0.

Bowman Becomes
Second to Get Honor 7

Chancellor J'ohn"G. Bowman, be-
cause of his assistance in the con-
struction ;of “the. finest. manifesta-
tion” of Y uoslav culture in America,
i‘eceived._the order of St...Savag II
decoration, Fridayﬁn the Chancel-
lor_’s ofﬁce. .He_was the, second per-
s(m_ in the_Uni_ted States to ‘receive
the decoration. _

The royal minister of Yugoslavia
to the United’ States,‘ His Excellen-
cy Constantin Fotitch, presented the
decoration in the presence of student
and faculty ‘representatives,
members of the Yugoslav room com-
mittee. , , »

“We feel,” asserted Minister Fo-
titch, “that no matter how active the
Yugoslav room c‘ommitte'e was, they
could not have accomplished their
aim of a room if Chancellor Bow-
man had not given his help andas-"
sistance. ._~ .» .~ . -   » . . -

“The Yugoslav room is, we feel,
the finest inanitestatioii of_Yugoslav
culture there is an Am'e'°ica,” add-
ed Mr. Fotitch.'

Dr. Bowman, in accepting the dec-
o:.‘ati_o1i said:

“Your Excellency, l\/lr.',‘Fotitch:

I accept this. rleccration in the
generous sni‘rit' in which you‘ have
presented it. ‘ '

“The Yugoslav people of Pitts-
burgh were among the first to re-
spond to the idea that each nation-
ality of which this community is
made up should express, by means
of various symbols, their ideals of
citizenship. We asked you what
it was that you might put into a
room at the University which

would make for a. better America.

To this question you responded, es-
pecially through Mr. I V
with‘ extraordinary vision,‘ i1nag,in-
ation,“ and practical" sense.‘ You
are th-e,great_fr,ontier nation be-
tween the“East and the West. You
brought to usfrom the East cour-
age, strength, music, and an ap-
preciation of other arts. From the
West you brought a sense of justice,
order, and peace such as Vergil
expressed .-for the Romans. All
these things you symbolized in the
Yugoslav Room.”

Besides a metal symbol suspend-
ed by a ribbon which is worn
around the neck when in full dress,‘
Dr. Bowman received a revers and
a certiﬁcate of the order of St.
Sava II. ‘

Professor Michael Pupin of Co-
lumbia university was the only other
person in the United States to re-
ceive the -order of St. Sava decora-
tion.

The Yugoslav room was dedicat-
ed in March of 1939.

Lawn Arrow-Shooting, Recalls
Days of Games on F rick Acres

Though coed archery classes still
attract admiring onlookers, play-
ing games on the green of the Ca-
thedral’s back lawn is not something
that the University‘ ‘family started
when they moved into "their Frick
acres home.

When the University acquired the
plot of land destined to become
the Pitt campus, the Forbes street
side of the property, this mansion’s
backyard, was charted off into
several double tennis courts. _ The
grass in those days, however, was
neither terraced, verdant, nor motor-
clipped. Scrubby patches of worn-
off turf marked up the playing ﬁelds
and formed many bad spots on the
lawn. Today the University not
only prides itself on its corps of
special caretakers, but also on its
daughters who always wear their

Pen Biographies

A pair of University graduates
are authors of two volumes in a ser-
ies of books. entitled “Pennsylvania
l3iographies”- which have been ac-
cepted for publication bythe Uni-
versity of _I3e'I13'1S‘\,7lvV'Ell’ll?.l':Pl“€SS in
cooperation with the Pennsylvania
lrlistorical society, according to Dr.
Alfred James, prof,€:ssor of history.

A city. schoolteacher, Lylly Lee
Nixon, .who received the master of
acts degree in 1934, is author of
“Colonel James Burd.” _Colonel
Burd was a road builder and mili-
tary commander in western Penn-
sylvania during the French and In-
dian war. V

“Captain William Trent” was writ-
ten by Dr. Sewell E. Slick, instruc-
tor at Slippery Rock State Teachers’
college. Dr. Slick obtained his doc-
tor’s degree in 1938. Captain Trent,
subject of his biography, was a fur
trader and land speculator in west-
ern Pennsylvania.

No publication date has been an-
nounced for these volumes. ’

As dated as the old Fords that
parked alongthe Forbes curb in
1921 were the wooden rail fences
that criss,crossed_1[n a black line
across the Frick estate. The low,
cultivated hedges that now border
all sides, of the Cathedral acres are
in"harm'ony with the carefully-
placed trees that transplanted the
lOl"l’l’l€l" clumps of shrubbery. , '

Now,’ as ‘the archery students
stretch their bows toward the Belle-
ﬁeld edge of the lawn, they see a
more classic View of"the YWHA
and the Public Education buildings,
instead of astrip of billboards. The

children out to play, it was a pleas-
