Oﬁicials, schools question legality of tuition tax

Mayor to ‘continue with proposal despite threat of lawsuit and reduction in state funding

Michael Macagnone
Senior Staff Writer

Mayor Luke Ravenstahl intends
to move forward with a student
tuition tax, despite the objections
of state representatives and local
universities."

The Intergovernmental Co-

, operation Authority, a group of

ﬁve people appointed by Gov. Ed

Rendell to oversee Pittsburgh’s ﬁ-
nances, rejected Ravenstahl’s pro-
posed budget Tuesday morning.
The budget includes a proposal to
tax all Pittsburgh college students
1 percent of their tuition, which is
$135 a year for students in Pitt’s
School of Arts and Sciences. The
tax, known as the Fair Share Tax
Act, is expected to bring in $16.2
million for Pittsburgh, city con-
troller Michael Lamb said.

If the city goes forward with
the proposal, as Ravenstahl said
he intends to do, it could face a
lawsuit or a loss in state fund-
ing. '

Legal advisers for The Pitts-
burgh Council on Higher Educa-
tion, a group of 10 colleges and
universities in Pittsburgh, think
the tax is illegal, said Mary Hines,
the group’s chair and president of
Carlow University. Pitt is a part of

the council.

“We have differing opinions on
the legality of the tax, and we’re
willing to test it in court if he con-
tinues to pursue it,” Hines said of
Ravenstahl. ,

Hines said she didn’t think a
lawsuit threatening the tax could
be good for the city’s 2010 bud-
get, regardless of whether it holds
up in court.

“[Ravenstahl]’s not going to

Apathy, religion and the campaign

SGB presidential candidates take opportunity to critique each other in fmal, formal debate

Caitlyn Christensen
Staff Writer

For the second and ﬁnal time,
SGB presidential candidates Charlie
Shull and Justin Romeo formally
debated last night.

They discussed topics ranging
from what they called a lack of
interest in Student Government
Board to religion and campaign

techniques.

Shull said he thinks students
have shown a lack of interest in
SGB when it’s rtmning smoothly
and professionally. '

“It has been identiﬁed as apa-
thy, but I don’t think it is apathy,”
Shull said.

Romeo said he thinks the Board
could increase interest by becoming
more transparent, adding that it
might try holding debates in more

public locations, such as Towers
Lobby.
“It’s important that students feel

"involved, that they know they will

not be shut out,” he said. '

Shull agreed that increased stu-
dent involvement is an important
issue, one he believes could be re-
solved by holding an open forum
for student organizations.

ganization, said she went to the de-
bate because she fears that Romeo’s
anti-abortion beliefs would hurt her
group’s chances of getting money
from SGB.

AlthoughjLane did not get an
opportunity to ask her question,

the candidates addressed her issues A

during the debate.

Shull asked Romeo about his
Christian background and its ef-
fect on his relationships with the

I Rainbow Alliance, Black Action

Society and other diverse student
organizations.

“Tolerance is a two-way street,”
Romeo said. “I think it’s impor-
tant to work to ﬁnd a common
ground.”

He said he has communicated
with the Rainbow Alliance, Black
Action Society and other organiza-
tions through e-mail.

In response, Shull said,_ “Stu-
dents want to know situations in
which people endorsed them.”

Romeo asked Shull if his can-
didacy is “just another stop on the
tour.” Shull. a current SGB member,
serves as Interfraternity Council
president. He is a former business
manager for Pitt Mock Trial.

In retort, Shull called Romeo a
“candidate of convenience,” running
for president so that students would

‘have a choice in the election.

Romeo recognized that he ran at
“the 11th hour,” but said he hoped
he would bring honest, open leader-
ship to the presidential position.

The 30- to 40-minute debate
took place in Room 837 of the Wil-
liam Pitt Union last night.

SGB elections committee chair
Sarah Heisey and judicial commit-
tee Andrew Yarnall moderated the
debate.

Student Government Board is urging
students to vote tomorrow not just on

changes to the group’s constitution.

SGB president Kevin Morrison
asked students to approve the revision
changes so the Board could make the

“We have spellingmistakesand have

“There’s no subjective change.”

Students can look online and learn
about the proposed changes, he said.

Morrison did stress that students

“Andrew should have known better

Lawsuit could delay tuition tax

Council on Higher Education, city oﬁﬁcials wonder whether Pittsburgh could collect tax in 2010

Tax(1

see money from the tuition tax anytime
soon,” she said.

But Ravenstahl isn’t just seeing resis-
tance from local colleges and universi-
ties.

Lamb wrote a letter to the ICA board
that stated that he thought the tax was
not reasonable.

“I’m not conﬁdent that [the tax] will
win in court, and even if it does, I don’t
think the city will be able to collect the
tax in 2010,” Lamb said.

Lamb and Councilman Bill Peduto, who
is chairman of Pittsburgh City Council’s
ﬁnance committee, introduced a plan
that included a series of cuts in spending
and increased revenue that totaled close
to $15 million without levying a student
tuition tax.

The plan did not include any service cuts
or reductions but focused on the stream-
lining of city government and measures,
such as collecting delinquent taxes, merg-
ing some functions with Allegheny County
and auctioning off property from Mellon
Arena to bring in additional money.

Peduto said his enrollment in Pitt’s
Graduate School of Public and Interna-
tional Affairs hasn’t affected his opinion
on the Fair Share Tax.

“[Being a student] doesn’t affect my
opinion, because, unlike some students,
I have a full time job, and I can afford to
pay a little extra,” he said.

Ravenstahl said in press conference
that he will continue to pursue the tax
because he thinks it will win in court.

He said he thought the Intergovern-
mental Cooperation Auth0rity’s decision
to reject-his proposal might have been
convoluted by the fact that four of its
members have ties to universities in the
city and that only two board members
are residents.

“I just don’t know if the voices of
Pittsburgh’s residents are being heard,”
he said.

Ravenstahl said he thinks the student

tuition tax is necessary to assure future
revenue for the city and to avoid service
cuts, particularly in the Public Safety
Department, which includes the police
force.

“[Service cuts] are not a threat — they
are a reality of our situation,” he said.

But a lawsuit might just be the beginning
of Ravenstahl’s worries, should City Coun-
cil approve his proposed student tax.

The Intergovernmental Cooperation
Authority has 20 days to approve or reject
Pittsburgh’s budget after it is enacted in
January. If the ICA doesn’t approve the
budget, the board has the power to with:
hold some state funding from the city. The
ICA has not withheld funds from the city
since 2004, when Pittsburgh was labeled as
a city in “financial distress.” That was the
same year the ICA was established.

Opinions

Editorial

SGB endorsement

Both SGB presidential candidates
met with The Pit News editorial board
yesterday to discuss their respective
platﬁ)m1s.Aﬁerspealcingwith the can-
didatesjbr aboutgo minutes each, the
editorial board decided to endorse a
candidate ﬁnr this year’s election.

This year’s election season began
with the minimum of nine candidates
to ﬁll the nine positions on Student
Government Board. Pitt senior and
current Board member Charlie Shull
ran uncontested for president, until
Pittseniorjustin Romeo took advantage
of an extended deadline to ﬁle to rim
for president last week — a move that
provided much-needed competitionto
an otherwise stagnant race.

The current Board faced heavy
criticism for its handling of the G-20
Summitaltermath. Shull hopestotake
a much more proactive approach by
establishing better contacts with city
and Pittadministration andpoliceupon
taking office. After the Summit, Shull
said Board members were “forced to
scramblefor contactsthat [they] didn’t
have.” Should suchanurgent situation
ariseagain, SGBwillbepreparedto get
in contact with the right people. l

Upon armouncing his candidacy,
Shull actively campaignedby speaking
with student groups and subsequently
seeking their endorsements. Romeo
said that big—time affiliations and en-
dorsements run contrary to his image
as a candidate who is non-elitist and
approachable to students. While well
intended, Romeo would have beenbet-
ter off acquainting himselfwith more
organizations. By doing otherwise, he
distances himselfas acandidate. Some
voterswillinadvertendy only recognize
Shullon theballot— a movethat cheats
students oftheir righttobe educated on
both candidates and their platforms.

The most signiﬁcant aspect of R0-
meo’s platform involves the formation
of a council of student organization
presidents, which would provide afo-

rum for groups to meet directly with
SGBto discuss issues and concerns. Ro-
meo hopes suchanorganizationwould
give smaller groups a larger voice, and
it seems like itwould. Club and student
organization representatives, however,
have a historically low tumout at SGB
meetings, and we question how such
a council would receive proper atten-
dance.

Romeo also said that the council

could be given powers such as voting
on amendments to the SGB constitu-
tion. By  this, SGB would be
surrendering some of its powers to a
body of people elected by very speciﬁc
groups of people — their respective
organizations —- ratherthan by thefull
student body. This differs from SGBs
very purpose: representing all non-
CGS Pitt students. Any SGB decisions
shouldbemadebyallstudents through
areferendum orbythe Board members
themselves.

Shull hopes to continue implement-
inghis Symplicityprogram, aresource
that intends to make the allocations
process for student groups moretrans-
parent. It will allow students to elec-
ironically track the progress of their
allocations. It also provides a means
for student groups to post events and
to communicate with one another and
with the Board. It’s a straightforward
systemthat should effectively keep stu-
dent groups organized and in contact
with SGB. ’

Romeo took issuewithcurrentSGB
operationswhensome Board members
regularly have nothingto report at the
weekly SGB meetings on the projects
theysaid tiieywould probablywork on.
He saidthatthe Board hasn’tcompleted
enough concrete projects, despite big
promises. While he’s been in contact
with SGB members, Romeo’s onlybeen
to one meetingthisyear, anattendance
ratethatmakes itvery diﬂiculttounder—
stand the current state of SGB.

Romeo wouldn’t necessarily be a
bad president, but his limited back-
groundinSGB andhis compartmental-
izedgoals—suchaseducatingstudents
about why misunderstood University
policiesarethewaythey are — makes
us think he’s better suited to run for
a position as a Board member rather
than president. I

Shull said the current Board has
done a positive j ob overall, however he
agrees there are still some big projects
left undone. Ifelected president, Shull
saidhe’llrtmhis Board inast:rictbut
professional fashion, and he won’t be
afraidto calloutunderachievingmem-
bers during public meetings if he feels
they aren’t doing their jobs.

SGB needs aleader who isn’tafraid
toﬁrmly oversee its members andwho
hasaclearvision of a directioninwhich
to move the Board. For these reasons,
The Pitt News endorses Charlie Shull
for SGB president.

Gerecht: I lack music

Soundtracks are key for those who wish to build their music repertoire

 
   

Carolyn Gerecht
Columnist

Forgivethis incredibly general andsad
statement, but the time for honesty
has come — I don’t know very much
about music.

Yes, I’m refering to every hipster’s
worst nightmare. .

This isn’taconfession of notknow—
ing how to read or play music — al-
though those statements would un-
fortunately also be true.

Imeanthatlhave abunch ofsongs
on my iPod, and yet, I’rn oftenunfamil—
iarwith artists who sound remarkably
—— and appreciably—sirnilartosome
of my favorites.

There’s zero rhyme and reason
to the music I have and that I do not.
My selection is comically, embarrass-
ingly random. For instance, I listened
to Ben Harper for a long time before I
stumbled across Damien Rice.

Andontop ofthatproblem-—-—here’s
wherethel1ipsterswillreallycringe—
I have extremely limited exposure to
songs the average college student has
never before heard. -

Ifwe agree that there are different
levels of obscurity in the music world,

ranging from the bands in which our
friends and classmates play to, say
Kanye, then my own level of familiar-
ity fades around Ingrid Michaelson.
You’re cringing, I know.

' Ifaskedtoexplain my musicaltastes
to astranger, I can only offer statements
as broad as, “I like music that is calm,”
or really mundane comments like, “I
like acoustic guitar.”

SGB not attuned to problems of students

 
   

Giles Howard
Columnist

Thisyear’s Student Government Board
elections aren’t so much aboutthe can-
didates and their platforms. Instead,
they showcase the faults inherent in
SGB’s workings. '
While the candidates themselves
all seem relatively competent and
have some decent ideas to improve
SGB, none of them have proposed the
sweeping reforms necessary to ﬁx the
seriously ﬂawed governmental body.
One ofthe most pressing issues not
addressed by the SGB candidates is the
lack of student involvement in SGB —
to the point where only 13 candidates
arerunningfornine positions, withfour
of these candidates entering the race
justaweek before election day.
Presidential candidates Justin Ro-
meo and Charlie Shull both proposed
newwaysto increase student organiza-

' tion contact with SGB members, but,

byidentifyingstudentorganizationsas
their only constituency, both presiden-
tial candidatesaresimplyperpetuating
the problerri.

The problem is that SGB is largely
perceived as one big allocations board
thats onlytangible purposeistodole out
money to student groups. Byfailing to
meaningliillytackle majorproblems on
campuslikethe rights of students inthe
aftermath of the G‘-20 Summit or the
debate surroundingthe proposed “Fair
Share Tax,” SGBmarginalizeditselfand
reinforced its image as a jumped—up
allocations board.

Even SGB’s allocations ﬁinctions
isolate it from the student body, be-
cause the allocations procedures are
something that few outside of those in
student organization leadership posi-
tions, The PittNews and SGB itselfactu-
ally understand. Even if an individual
student did take an interest in the al-
locations process andﬁillyunderstood
the procedure, he wouldn’t be able to
participate in the process because al-
locations recommendations are made
behind closed doors and are voted on
inweekly meetings withoutany public
input.

Increasingly isolated with little ,
student interest in the election and no
studentinputinSGB’sweeklybusiness,
SGB faces a crisis of legitimacy in to-
morrow’s election, withtumoutalmost

guaranteed to be lowertiian last year.
Contributing to its ﬂawed image is
the fact that candidates were required
to sign a statement this year waiving
their“iightto contesttlie2009 Student
GovemmentBoard Election results due
to technological inaccuracies due to
either software, hardware or human

One of the most
pressing issues not
addressed by the SGB
candidates is the lack
of studentinvolvement
in SGB -

Shull saidthatsuchawaiverhelpsto
keep the electoral process moving and
that candidates simply need to have

faithinthe system. While Shull sees the
waiver as an expedient, Romeo said
that it was a suspect addition to this
year’s race.

Butitisn’tjustthewaiverthattaints
this year’s election. Rather, it’s the seri-
ous miscommunication that plagued
the entry of late candidates that un-
dermines myfaith inthe SGB electoral
system.

For instance, in my colurrm last
week, current SGB president Kevin

Morrisonsaidthatlate candidates had

tobe approvedbyWednesdayNov. 11at
noon. But on Nov. 8, elections commit-
tee chairwoman Sarah Heisey sent out
ane-mailtoprospective latecandidates
telling them that the deadline for late
entry was actually Tuesday Nov. 10 at
noon“dueto rest1ictionswithComput-
ing Services.”

At least one prospective candidate
didrftgetthis e—mail andinsteadtumed
his application material on the origi-
nal Wednesday deadline. The student
wastoldthathehadmissedtiiecorrect
deadline and would be unable to run.

ThatSGB wouldfailto communicate
properly with a prospective candidate
and then penalize that student for its
mistake raises serious questions about

the internal workings of SGB. Because
ofthis particularfailure, students have
one less candidate to choose from in
tomorrovifs elections and the ﬁeld is
narrower than it could have been.

These issues taken together raise
serious questions aboutthe legitimacy
and eﬂicacy of SGB as an institution.
The lack of competition or cainpaign—
ing,the serious miscommunicationthat
costone studenthis participation inthe
race as well as the suspectwaiver that
costs candidates their right to contest
the election results are serious issues
that SGB needs to address.

Because such ﬂaws have emerged,
SGB candidates need to think beyond
new initiatives to go paperless or im-
prove the school’s green image and
come up withwaysto seriouslyreform
SGB. No matter what, it is clear that
SGB can’tcon1inuetoﬁ.inctionasitdoes
todayandstilldiscliargeitsdiitiestotlie
studentbody.

We deserve an SGB engaged with
the problems of the student body. We
need serious internal reforms of the
student government.

Here’s the thing: I want to know
more about music. That isn’t the same
as, “Iwantto become expeitlyversedin
songs onlyl have heard” Obscurity is
not alitrnus testfor good music. Sorry,
Spin magazine.

Butlainadamantly opposed to the
idea of turning my ears only toward
the Billboard Top 100 to ﬁll my iTunes
collection. Whatever “Party in the

USA.” Miley’s yelling about, I am not
attending.

These conditions have led me to
snatch up movie soundtracks practi-
cally by the handful, like salty, yellow
movie theater popcorn.

I absolutely reﬁise to be embar-
rassed for relying on this genre to
expand my musical horizons. I know
I’rn not the only one. Celine Dion was a
Canadian nobodybefore“'I”1tanic.”And

every smaitass in America fell in love
with Kimya Dawson after the release
of ‘flunoi’. _

The movie soundtrack also brings
us treasures in the form of the satis-

fying original soore.Jai Ho, anyone? I

can’thelp but doalittle L-shaped move
with myaimeveiytime that songplays.
Andwhataboutthe openingto “Forrest
Gump,” the music that plays while the
feather ﬂoats down and down to the

bus stop? To hear it on the soundtrack g

is heartwarming to me.

Forthose ofus who aren’tconsmnt-
ly ﬂipping through Spin magazine or
scouring Pittsburgli’s nightclubs for
something new, the soundtrack itself
is a didactic instrument.

One day, I’ll answer the question
“What kind of music do you like?”with
a statement more reﬁned than “Uh, I
don’tknom stuffthat sounds nice.” For

Movie soundtracks bring mainstream, obscure music

betterorworse, I’1lhave soundtracksto
thankfor that.

To the indie soundtrack, the more
mainstream and the heart-palpitating
theme to Braveheart I put on my head-
phones, and bow down.

Let us play.

When real estate and theater merge

Barebones Productions will stage “Glengarry Glen Ross” Nov. 12-29

“Glengarry Glen Ross”
Nov. 12-29
New Hazlett Theater

Tickets: $20 in advance,
$25 at the door

A depressing real estate business can become entertaining under the right stage lighting.

Even in atime plagued by reces-
sion, people are still able to ﬁnd
solace in the magical world of live
theater. Now, thanks to the new
Barebones Productions mounting
of David Mamet’s “Glengarry Glen
Ross,” people can actually be enter-
tained by the inner workings and
dynamics of the normally depress-
ing real estate business.

“Ross” is the 2009-10 season
opener for Barebones Productions.
Barebones artistic director Patrick
Jordan has a ﬁnger in every pie
when it comes to bringing this pro-
duction to the New Hazlett Theatre
stage. He nursed the production
in its infant stages by assembling
the show’s artistic team. Jordan
worked with the directors and de-
signers he found to cast the actors.
Jordan himself was lucky enough to
land the role of Ricky Roma, one of
show’s leading men.

“Ricky Roma is the ﬂashiest and
top salesman in the office. [He is]
not afraid to say what’s on his mind
at any given time. But when there is
a threat that he could lose the sales
he worked so hard for, he loses his
composure like the rest of the guys,”
Jordan said.

Barebones Productions has
been taking the Steel City’s the-
ater scene by storm for nearly

seven years now. The theater has
tackled the work of Pulitzer Prize—
and Tony Award—winning “August:
Osage County” playwright Tracy
Letts, Neil LaBute and Kenneth
Lonergan, among others. For Jor-
dan, the chance to stage a produc-
tion of this Mamet masterpiece was
very exciting, and the choice to do
so was an easy one.

“I think this show is one of the
best American plays of the last 30
years. It ﬁts our aesthetic [at Bare-
bones Productions] perfectly. Actu-
ally, it is basically the archetype of
the plays we are attracted to: great
for actors and has balls,” he said.

The task of bringing this work to
the New Hazlett stage is completely
in the hands of director Melissa
Martin. She has collaborated with
Barebones once before, in Novem-
ber of 2005 with their production
of Byrony Lavery’s “Frozen.”

“Glengarry Glen Ross” is a dra-
matization of the business world,
speciﬁcally real estate, told through
the lives of four corporate sharks
based in the windy city of Chica-
go. When the stakes of a particular
property deal get extremely high,
each man is pushed to his moral
limit. The thrill of this play comes
from the audience’s revelations
about what the characters will do

Next week brings along that fate-
ful day of turkey and rejoicing as
over—worked college kids ﬁnally
get a chance to relax.

For many of us, this will be the
ﬁrst time we’re returning to the
nest since our parents dropped us
off in August.

While the opportunity for tele-
vision marathons and free food
is great, an (almost) entire week
with extended family can be a bit
daunting.

If you’re looking to dodge Aunt

Sally’s cheek pinches for a few
hours, I suggest seeking refuge in
the cozy conﬁnes of your bedroom
and cleaning out your closet. Af-
ter all, the holidays are a time of
giving to others, so why not clear
out those folded piles of nostalgia
and take a drive over to your local
Goodwill? Not to mention if you
clear your sartorial cache now,
you’ll have all the more space to
cram in Black Friday purchases!

I spent a few days over the sum-
mer clearing out my closet. I’m a
self-proclaimed neat freak, and my
haphazard wardrobe was not exact-
ly depictive of someone who folds

her underwear. I ﬁgured I needed
to say adios to the stretched out
cardigans and ﬂared jeans I have
never worn. Upon digging around,
however, I realized my closet was a

off sales, moments of impulse and
generally bad choices.

these that I learn to rule out cap
sleeves, full skirts and Bermuda
shorts for myself. Plus you never
know what kind of hidden gems
will show up. Recently, I found
a handful of scarves I had long
forgotten and a white clutch that
I only used once before stowing
away. '

If you’re not sure how to go
about pulling the weeds from your
drawers, I’ve come up with a few
pointers. It’s best to approach this
arduous task with a tough-love sen-
sibility. So take no offense, buckle
down and start ﬁlling those trash

Bullock shines in ‘Blind Side’

Acting redeems and otherwise derivative movie

Azia Squire
Staff Writer

“The Blind Side”

Starring: Sandra Bullock, Quinton Aaron,
Tim McGraw

Directed byjohn Lee Hancock

Studio: Alcon Entertainment

Grade: B

We’ve all seen this movie before —— atragically
misunderstood kid is rescued by a welcoming
and affluent family who sees something in him
that no one everhas before. Afterafew setbacks,
a happy ending ensues for everyone.

“The Blind Side” doesn’t deviate too much
ﬁomthisformula, probably because it’s based on
a book (“The Blind Side: Evolution of a Game”),
which originates from the true story of the Bal-
timore Ravens’ offensive lineman Michael Oher.
After enduring an impoverished childhood, he
ends up at Briarcrest Christian School where he
begins to play football — the sport that essen-
tially saves his life — and meets the people who
quickly become his family.

Sandra Bullock plays the no—nonsense, rich,
intensely Christian and Republican (she meets
her "ﬁrst Democrat” in one scene) Leigh Anne
Tuohy, who is the ﬁrstto lend “Big Mike” (Quin-
ton Aaron) a helping hand by allowing him to
sleep on her farnily’s couch. Bullock has always
been a dynamic actress, and she manages to add
unexpected layers to the character. One of her
more charming moments in the ﬁlm is when
she goes toe-to—toe with an easily forgettable
one—dimensional villain about the kind of gun
she carries.

Though it has its heartwarming moments,
“The Blind Side” also has its heavy~handed mo-
ments. It’s also pleasandy aware of its own ﬂawed

' Courtesy Ralph Nelson

attempts at analyzing the psychological state of
Big Mike (“He doesn’t trust men,” Bullock ex-
plains about Big Mike to his coach, “they pretend
to care about you unﬁl they disappear”).

Aaronisthe personiﬁcation ofwatchingpaint
dry. He spends the majority of the ﬁlm staring
meaningfully at generic symbols of happiness,
like the balloons ﬂoating in the sky that distract
him duringfootballpractice. Unfortunately, when
he does directly answer a question, he ends up
dropping anvils, like armouncing to Leigh Anne
that he’s actually never had abed when she mis-
takenly assumes that he’s just never had his own
room. _

BigMike does have chemist1ywiththeyoung-
est son, S._]. (Jae Head). The witIy, adorable kid is
reminiscent ofHayden Panettiere’s performance
as Sheryl in “Remember the Titans.” He is also
responsible for the majority of the laughs in the
movie — not that he has much competitionwith
Lily Collins’ comatose portrayal of Collins, the
conveniently named eldest daughter.

The ﬁlm draws strength by graceﬁilly and
sensitively addressing many issues, including
the idea of afamilybringingaboy it doesn’tknow
into its home with its teenage daughter; racial
issues and the whereabouts of Big Mike’s bio-
logical parents.

Theﬁlmdeﬁnitelyhas its moments of incon-
sistencies and omissions,whichisto be expected
of many ﬁlms “based on a true stories.” Toward
the end the true conflict comes to ﬁuition. You’ll
deﬁnitely ﬁnd yourself wishing the story had
taken another perspective on the dead horse
that is the unlucky-kid—gets-a—second-chance-
at—life story The fact that Big Mike’s talent rests
in football itselfis a cliche.

Still, despite its formulaic pitfalls, “The Blind
Side”managestobe somewhatentertainingand
gives those heartstrings a hefty tug when you
least expect it.

“That’s six more rebounds
offensively than we could’ve
had defensively. That’s 12
points,” Binghamton interim
head coach Mark Macon said.

He also pointed out that
Pitt had just six turnovers to
Binghamton’s 13. With the
seven turnover advantage for
Pitt, that’s another 14 points,
he said.

“With those 26 points, it’s a
much different game,” Macon
said.

Redshirt freshman point
guard Travon Woodall had an
impressive game as he contin-
ues to make his case for a start-
ing role once Jermaine Dixon
returns from injury.

Woodall had 10 points and

up the court leading to several
baskets in transition that never
allowed Binghamton to get set.
Graduated point guard Levance
Fields didn’t get 10 assists in a
game until his senior season,
and Woodall credits Fields for
teaching him how to be a better
point guard.

“I want to credit a lot of my
assists to Levance from last
year,” Woodall said. “He did a
great job of showing me how to
be" real patient and [take] what
the defense gives me.”

Junior Brad Wanamaker fin-
ished second on the team with
14 points. He opened up the
second half by scoring seven
consecutive points.

Maybe the biggest differ-
ence in yesterday’s game from
Pitt’s narrow three—point win
on Friday against Wofford was
its ability to carry over how the
team practiced to the game.
The Panthers will look to do
the same tomorrow night when

Women win opener v

The Panthers beat North Florida yesterday

Lauren Kirschman
Senior Staﬁ" Writer

The PitIwomen’s basketballteam used
a21-4runduringtl1eﬁrstnine minutes
of the second halfto help seal a 61-35
victory over North Florida (0-2) in yes-
terday’s season opener.

The game started at 11 am, and
with at least 4,000 children in atten-
dance for Pitt’s School Days promo-
tional event, the Panthers (1-0) jumped
out to an early lead despite what head
coach Agnus Berenato described as a’
lacklusterﬁrsthalﬁ

“We started off really slow,” Ber-
enato said. “I don’tknow iftheyweren’t
awake or if they forgot to shower or
what. In the second half, we picked
up the intensity, and we picked up the
pace.”

Pitt took a 25-13 lead into the
break.

Berenato said the Panthers im-
proved on converting oiftumovers
and holding onto rebounds in the
second half.

“—

She said improvement in these ar-
eas helped tiie Panthers build a lead
in the second half and that she was
pleasedwith the difference intheteam
after the break.

“Inthe ﬁrsthalf,we were extremely
disappointedwiththe rebounding,”Be-
renato said. “I started trackingmissed
rebounds thatwere on our hands that
we didn’t comeupwith.Thatwas some-
thing we adjusted at halftime.”

Berenato said some of Pitt’s early
offensive troubles could be attributed
tothe new group ofplayers learningto
mesh as a team.

“In the past, we always had [Xenia]
Stewart and [Shavonte] Zelloustotake
over,” Berenato said. “There is no more
ofthem [becausetheyboth graduated].
We have been very hard on this team.
We see great things. We see where we

Junior Shayla Scott agreed, say-
ing the Panthers focused on creating»
team chemistry over the summer
during workouts, and it’s something
the team continues to work on during
practice.

“We go against each other and ﬁg-
ure outwhat everyone’s good at,” Scott
said. “Ithinkit’s somethingthatis going

Bye week will help Berry get healthy for Brawl  
After hurting his shoulder against Notre Dame, cornerback:Aaron Berry can use the off week to heal before playing West Virginia

Staff Writer

’ Berry and the Bye

When senior comerback Aaron

Berry left Saturday’s game against 2

Notre Dame with 2:59 left inthe third
quarter; it didn’t take long before his
presencewas missed. ‘

AsBerrywatchedfromthe sideline
with a sling around his injured right
shoulder, the Irish passing attack
started to roll. Notre Darnefs two sub-
sequent offensive possessions resulted
in touchdowns. '

While the Panthers held on for a
27-22 victory, Berry’s importance to
the defense was revealed.

During his Big East teleconference

onMonday, coachDaveWannstedtsaid .

he is hopeful that Berrywill be back in

the lineup when the No. 9 Panthers A

travel to Morgantown to battle West
Virginia on Nov. 27.

“[Berry] was ﬁne yesterday. He
is sore. I would just say that he’ll be
day—to-day. It is not a season—ending
injury or anything,” Wannstedt said.

Fortunately for the Pitt defense,

the upcoming bye week presents an
opportunity for Berry to get healthy
or for the Panthers to prepare for his
absence. ' -
“The bye weekwillbeneﬁtakidlike
Aaron Berry,” Wannstedt said.
In 2008, Berrywas selected to the

. all—Big East Second Team. This year;

he has accounted for 25 tackles, one
interception and six pass breakups.

With Berry out of the game, Pitt
turnedto redshirt junior Ricky Gary,
who also lelttheﬁeldwithaninjury, and
then sophomore Antvvuan Reed to ﬁll
the empty cornerback position.

According to Wannstedt, the criti-
calgame time that Reed and Gary spent
on the ﬁeldwillbeneﬁt them down the
road, especially considering that they
were defending against Golden Tate
and Michael Floyd. -

“It was a learning experience for
those kids to be on the ﬁeld in that
situation, playing against some great
players,” Wannstedt said.

that introduced the sophomore re-
ceiver to a national audience.
Baldwin ﬁnished with ﬁve catches

for 142 yards and one touchdown. On
Monday, the Aliquippa, Pa. native was
named the BigEast Offensive Player of
the Week. V

' For Wannstedt, Sat11rday’s perfor-
mance was another step in the evolu-
tion of Baldwin into a well-rounded
receiver.

‘jonathanisbecomingamore com-

plete player——whether he’s gettingthe
ball or not gettingthe ball, [whether] it’s
run or it’s pass,” Wannstedt said.

Wannstedt noted that Baldwin A V

isn’t only beneﬁcial to the deep pass-
ing game anymore. He has improved

his run—blocking and added a number

of routes to his repertoire.

“He’s learning the game. He’s ma-
