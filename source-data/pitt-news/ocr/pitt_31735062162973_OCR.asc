Rexroth is a pioneer in the com-
bining of poetry and jazz in live
performance-. His poetry, accord-
ing to critics, “has evolved from
an early use of dissociative tech-
nique .‘. . ‘to a-mature purposive,

\

Z and highly rational modern criti-

cism.” '
'Although he now repudiates
some aspects of 'the much-_pub-
licized “Beat Generation,” 1 he
has been a mentor’ to many‘ of
the key writers in this group.‘ »
'Of'his poetic‘ world Rexroth has
written that it “may include Ron-
sard or Apollinaire, Horace or
Tu Fu, Robert Burns or Mal-
larme, but it does not include my
contemporaries of the Reactionary
Generation‘— the‘Country Gentle-
man and Cornbelt Metaphysic-
‘als.” .- - ' A
.Rexr_oth is “thatrare bird,”
comments the New York Herald
Tribune Book Review‘, a thor-
.oughly modern poet who can be
understood by anybody.”
“In Defense of the Earth” is his
latest volume of poetry. He was
awarded the Shelley Memorial

Deferred Rush Met Negatively
By Most in Fraternity System,

The.proposed deferred fraternityrushing program for
ﬁrst-trimester men has met with mixed opinions from the
fraternities, Most do not agree with the proposals.

_ ‘Kappa Nu feels that deferred rushing Wil_l.not hurt any
"fraternity which can go a term without a pledge class.
Tire fraternity which needs the. fal1,pledge class for

which ~suffers,‘~the group feels. On
the whole, Kappa Nu is against
deferred rushing} . '
From: the ‘Delta Tau Delta
house came the remark that at
‘its Eastern District Conference
a survey proved that schools
3 with deferred rushing programs
are below average in scholastic-
» standings. ' p
The Delts believe that although

. it maylhave some advantages, it

would be noggood here.’ 7 ~
_ The president of Delta Sigma
Phi stateslthat he-. believes that

This is attributed to the fact
that his brothers .will be a help
to him. He also states that dur-

A $490,000 grant from the Ford
Foundation will provide major
support to two new teacher edu-
cation programs, Chancellor Litch-

The grant will enable the

two programs designed to provide
for each student both a liberal

A feature of the new teacher

supervision of University and

the freshmen from rushing in their

they will fall into a r.outine and
will not be interested in fraterhity

-. Bill Ridder _of Theta Chi claims

that \it would not be a good pro-

gram for this school. He states,
“There is too much pressure from
outside groups and the school as a
whole’.’’ '

William Rodder, piesident of

F-Lamda Shi Alpha, has transfer-

red from a school which em-

ployed the“ deferred system of"

fraternity rush and he claims
that there were deﬁnite advant-l,
ages. .- D . "
He said that if such a plan
would be a success at a large city
school as Pitt, it would present a
question.

The Phi Delta Thetas have had.
. a conference on the idea and have

come to the general opinion that,
although it may be advantageous
in the long run, deferred rush
would hinder their immediate
plans. ' x‘ '

The-plans'for fall ru'sh have al-
ready been set. They feel that the
fraternity offers friends, guidance
and stresses scholarship. '

ering three-fourths tuition. , _ *
If the graduate assistant program were operated more
competently in all departments, these hundreds‘ of thou-
_ sands of dollars would not be wasted and- would not be
termed a give-away. I .
 The most damaging aspects of the program «are_the
method in which graduate assistants are appointed and the
supervision or checks placed on them once they are hired.
“ " In general, these persons are selected almost wholly on
the basis of their undergraduate record.. No ‘criteria of
éteaching ability in considered. Besides submitting a tran-
.’cr,ipt and’ letters of recommendation, prospective young
‘‘ ieachers ﬁll out an application. ’ ' » '
 Amazingly enough interviews are rare, almost " non-
;existent. Of seven departments phecked at random, only
{the English and political science departments require in-
erviews. \..,
 1 The speech department depends on “credentials;_ eco-
inomics places emphasis on the scholastic record; history
and" mathematics depend (in the three items mentioned

ect and ‘a satisfactory record. ,
.',_: Supervision once the assistants are appointed is equally
-as weak as the method for selection. In a few instances, staff
members maintain some sort of supervision over the grad-
‘uate assistants. However, this system, in general, is ex-
tremely weak. .
A In many cases, a graduate student is hired, teaches his
‘course, gives exams and hands in ﬁnal grades. Not once dur-
,-ing his appointment as graduate assistant does the depart-
‘ment check any of his material, methods or grades. ‘
,' More important, perhaps than wasting the million dol-
—{l,gr’s, is the lower degree of education that students, in most
‘cases, -receive. We do not ﬁnd that the assistants themselves
are at fault. They are only taking advantage of an extreme-.
1y luxurious situation. 0‘ . ~ '
_ _ Unfortunately, it is probably impossible to eliminate
_,the graduate assistant program. The graduates are needed

" Picking Your   

C)ver the Shoulder

By David Breaksi-one

VI was talking about some lasting impressions of
my cautiously- termed “college _career.” I had just
observed that my most striking failing was_doing
what I was told too often. (For that~ﬁrst effort,
I have already been accused of I
being negative and an inveterate
fault-ﬁnder in an otherwise ﬂaw-
less society.).

I mentioned earlier that these
four years have been a’ calcu-
lated, intense adventure. I can
recall. having been -told during
my "last year in high school that
the University was a pretty me-
diocre place to pickup an'edu-
cation. That warning haunted -.=- _

"me for some time and I made up ~
my then serious mind that I was not going to get
another, assembly-line, diploma. My strategy was
not a particularly new one. I would just pick my
spots. ' y

Unfortunately, many of my picked spots were
soft. But in the course of. wandering around I did
hit some pretty good people. I '

A Worthwhile Phrase 1 .

There’ was the freshman course in core curricu- A

llim in social sciences, whibh while weak in ,its(
plan, had an excellent instructor, a young/man

from the geography department whohadyttfe knack ,

of “opening doors” for wide—eyed freshmen.

My sophomore course in the history. of English
literature enticed me into a literature major, and
introduced me ‘to. a professor whom I still con-
sider among the two or three best in the school.

The wonders‘ of physics fascinated me during
my junior year, and if physicists ‘have become the
most fashionable members of the scholarly com-
munity, they deserve that distinction. There are
still genuine’ frontiers to roll back inltheir ﬁeld. ‘

That makes only three-good spots that I picked, .

doesn’t it Jay? Better put it this way. These were
the key courses in a motley collection of forty or
so. But to reinforce my argument that education

goes on outside of thesacred classroom, let’s add

' some other "important learning experiences.
Students and the Others . .1.-'
The Term   Paper
I I By Jim Vaughan it I

Pitt students are now watching the fair days of

spring usher in another termgpaper season.‘ They
are turning in hundreds and hundreds of ‘pounds
-of undying prose this season j_ust as ‘they did in
A in seasons pas . ‘ ' ,

In true scholastic form these academics .go
through three mental phases --
the general Term-Paper Syn-
drome —— in producing their term
pai5ers- .. .. ‘ ‘I
, Students begin the first phase,

‘the Procra'stination Phase, early
in the term when they get their ":
term paper topics. After an
abortive effort to get‘ their as— .
signments out of the way early,

they lay them aside. ‘ I

This is natural, ‘because’ the
end of the term is far off; they
have plenty of time to work on term papers. They
continuethe usual life of a student . . . i.e., TV,
parties, alfew dates, and_ some homework. .

Faster . . . Slower

As the term runs on they speed up the pace of
their student life faster and faster while thinkin
less and less about their term papers. »

Students now begin the Repression Phase of
the Term Paper Syndrome. Here they are char-
acterized by bizarre speech, random movements,
easy distractibility, and occasional "forgetting of
identity. They come to -discover new intellectual
yistas such as a 900-page novel about an’ unedu-
cated shepherd or they suddenly develop a “cul—
tural” appreciation for every Midday 'VSeries

‘ program

As the time ﬂies by, students somehow feel
themselves walking one a balloon with spiked shoes.
'And one week before the due date, they are sitting
somewhere with friends having intellectual com-
-munion on the subjects of “truth,” “justice,” “love,”

V“tinie,”’or “pizza pie.”"., ~ ' A

People and Things _

A _ fabled Tuesday evening discussion group,
run by the head of the counseling center, provided
more intellectual stimulation during my first two‘
years than any individual course. You remember,-
Jay, some of the wild'hassles we used to get into
during those Tuesday sessions.

I am sure that we never came close to deciding

’There is nothing as unnerving as an omniscient
college sophomore. _' '

There were some inspiring people -around the
university whose brief visits held more than ﬂeet-

heim’s existential approach to the problems of
modern religion was the most stimulating expo-
sition of the unknowable that I had heard up until-
thatrtime. I still haven’t made that committment
myself, in case you might be wondering. "

“Your /friend, John Ciardi, sticks in my mind‘ as.

the embodiment of a "contemporary ,human/ist.
When no one anymore expresses pure feeling, and

a’ precious few write’ poetry’ unself—consciously,__

Ciardi,‘ is a refreshing breeze.

The Honors Convocation-‘I brought Robert Frost,

and‘ Archibald MacLeish here- It; is difficult to say K

anything appropriate and ungushy about “their visits

that to. be ‘a writer was the noblestprofession on
earth. It seems lque_er_ that we pay poets public
»honor, but ‘turn around to laugh up. our self-
righteous .sleeves on all otheroccasions. ~ j

And there were " the students withgood heads
who counted a lot too. If the old Oxford idea of
_a community of teachers and interested students is
to materializein this rigid "old town, then we need
more of those good heads, I guess. We’v'e gotten a
good number of ﬁne‘, new faculty heads since
been there,

And a bigger library, and a spacious Union
l(..with new orange chairs in the». lounge), and»

It’s enough to make you stop and think.

Dramatic Strength

By CHUCK DUNBAR

Drama at its best is the proper phrase for the Theatre 11
presentation of “Anna Christie” last Thursday. _

C If all of its productions are equally as good, the gro.up

and its reputation will soon outgrow

It was Lawrence Bloom in the lead role of Chris Christo-

its present cramped

pherson who captured the imagin-

ﬁrst-rate acting.
The balding actor spoke his lines
with a very ﬂuent and convincing
, Swedish accent, doubtlesslya diffi-
cult task to master. '

Shows Training

The crystal—clear and diction-
perfect voice of Eleanor Irwin re-
ﬂected extensive training in the

ﬁeld of dram. Miss Irwin was

seen his Anna Christie, daughter of
Old Chris, a part demanding great
skill in the display of emotion.

, ,Miss Irwin most certainly proved

‘L’ that she possessed more than the

necessary skill.
Lawrence ‘ [Ieller as Mat
(Burke, the Irish sailor in love
I with Anna, was equal to his role
and turned in‘a"’very convincing
"performance. He was’ a true
‘Irishman.
As usual Jay Lerman blended,
« like _a ‘ versatile chameleon‘, into
his role, in this instance as Larry
the bartender. Joyce Thomas as
Marthy Owen deserves praise for
\ her, comparatively short but nev-
ertheless excellent part’ in the
\, show.‘
‘ ' Heart Content Counts
Eugene O’Nei1 ‘once again
worked his philosophy into one of
his plays, in this case “It doesn’t
matter what you were; it’s what

father, Chris, and the two fall
in love. A rivalry for Anna’s

- Ulriqhs Score‘

Director John Ulrich, associate
professor of speech, must have
stressed quality in’ every detail,
because the production was a truly
artful piece or work.

_His wife, Reva Ulrich, design-
ed three very eﬁective settings,
which were beautifully executed
by William Evans.- I 0
'-Costuming was both, consistent

and realistic. _This, in addition to
the settings, gave (the presentation

tion.  , .

The present Theatre 11, located
in the Cathedral of Learning’s 11th
floor, is well equipped with every-
thing but‘ adequate seating facili-
ties. Because of the extremely
small size of~1126 Cl, it was stand;
ing-room-only a full half-hour be-*
fore the curtain went up. .

Despite its physical drawbacks’
one conclusion can be ‘reached
about Theatre 11: a small theatre
may limit the audience, but it does
not limit the quality of the pro-
duction. I

"AN EMDARRASSMENT OF RICHES”

Twinkly, lovable old Dr. Wagstaff Sigafoos, head of chemistry
at the Upper. Rhode Island College of Science and Palmistry,
- cares naught for glory and ‘wealth. All he cares about is to work
in his l:rboratory,*,to play Mozart quartets with a few cronies,
‘to smoke a good 'Marlboro, and to throw sticks forhis faithful
dog Trey to-fetch. 1 . A v
80 when, after years of patient research, Dr.»Sigafoos dis-_
_, covered Reverse,’ a shaving cI'eam.wl1icl1 causes whiskers to.
grow inward instead of outward, thus enabling a man to bite
" oil his beard -‘instead of shaving it, it never even crossed liisf
mind that he had come upon a key to fame and riches; he simply
assigned all his royalties from Reverse to the college and went
on with his quiet life of working in the laboratory, playing
Mozart quartets, smoking good Marlborosand. throwing sticks
for his faithful dog Trey. (Trey,’incidentally, had dic_d some
years earlier ‘but habit is a strong thing and Dr. Sigafoos to
this day continues to throw sticks.) .
As everyone knows, Reverse turned out to be a madly success-
ful shaving cream. Royalties in the ﬁrst montlr amounted to .
$290,000, which came in mighty handy, believe you me, because
the college had long been postponing some urgently needed‘
_repairs'—a liglitniiig rod f or the men’s dorniitory, new hoops for
the basketball court, leather patches for the chess tean1’s elbows

and a penwiper for the Di1'cctor of Admissions. \

In the second month royalties .a.m,ounted to an even million
dollars and lthe college bought Marlboro cigarettes‘ for all
students and facility members: It is interesting that the college
chose .Marlboro ciga17éttes though they could well have afforded
more expensive brands. The reasonis simply this: you can pay
more for a cigarette but you can’t get a better flavor, ‘a. better
smoke. If you think ﬂavor went out when ﬁlters came in, try
a Marlboro, The ﬁlter ciga.1'ette with the unﬁltered taste. You,
too, can smoke like a _millionaire at a cost which does no violence
to the slimmest of budgets. Marlboros come, in soft pack or _
ﬂip—top box and can be found at any tobacco counter. Million-
aires can be found on yachts. '

But I digress. We were speaking of /the royalties from
Reverse which continue to accrue at an astonishing ratc-now,
in excess of one million dollarslper week. The college "is doing all

_ it can to spend the money; the student-faculty ratio which:used
to be thirty stuxrlentsl to one teacher is now thi1'ty teachers to
one student; the Gulf Stream has been purchased for the
Department of Marine Biology; the Dean of Women has been
gold-plated. I 4 I‘

But money does not buy happiness, especially in the college
world. Poverty and ivy—that is the academic life-—not power
and pelf. The Upper Rhode Island College of Science and
Palmistry is frankly embarrassed by all this wealth, but I am‘
pleased to report that the trustees are not taking their calamity
lying down. Last. week they earmarked all royalties for a crash
research program hezided by Dr. Wagstaff Sigafoos to develop
a whisker which is resistant to Reverse. Let usall jo-in in wish-
ing the old gentlcman success. © ‘"60 M“ S*“""="

‘ Last season the Panther
trackmen lacked depth and
turned in poor dual meet per-
formances. This year the Cats
have most of their sprintmen
back and ‘are looking for im-
provement. _

Coach Carl-‘Rees is also looking
for improvement from his mile
relay team that will f_eaturecDave
Kelly who runs a good 59.6 quar-
ter; Bill Hinchberger, who could
be one of the most improved Pan-
ther runners; Reed Clark and
speedy l\1el'Barnwell, who’s abil-
ity has been proven many times.

“Our relay team only had fair
indoor success,” Rees said, “but
the potential is there and I ex-

pect them to improve on the out-
door track.” For some reason

Rees has been expecting im-

provement from‘ all‘ of his track-

men.- P ’ V ’

Not all of the-Panthers 23 can-
didates are untesx d. Lee Profog-
.ner pole vaulted 12’ 6” ‘indoors

are in their third week, of prac-
tice as they prepare for the an-
nual intera-squad game at the
