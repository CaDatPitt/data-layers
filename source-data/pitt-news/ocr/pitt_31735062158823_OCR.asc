of Iowa State College and at pres-
ent attached to Battery A, 5th
U. S. ﬁeld artillery at ‘Madison

Ontario, New York—where he is

New Public Heroes . . .

Rather than beat his never-
quiet tom-tom on “insidious” in-
ﬂuences in America today, Mr.
Hearst, ever alive with a “timely
campaign” to capture his reading
public, gives an indication of a
new crop of public heroes.

Block Needs

More Rooters

“It’s fun, not work,” claimed
William McKenna, C38, today as
he and D. C. Schultz, BA38, co-
chairman for SFA’s student cheer-
ing block, sent out a call for new
registrants.

With Friday set as the last day,
McKenna said that several haun-
dred students were needed to 
up the cheering block. .

“The cheering block involves
only several short rehearsals for
its members, and for this they get
the best student seats. The ﬁrst
rehearsal will probably be held the
Tuesday before the Duquesne
game.

“Registration will continue this
week from 1 to 2 o’cock in 828 Ca-
thedral. All students desiring to
work in this cheering block should
register.”

McKenna scheduled a commit-
tee meeting for 3 p. 111. today.

To Clarify

Am -‘Editorial

Our attention has been rcalled to the appearance and subse-
quent rcverberations of ‘the column “If I May Point” in the
fourth. issue of the Pitt "News, September 24.

It is regrettable that any article appearing, and particu-
larly this article which concerns the late Andrew W. Mellon,
should be construed to represent anything but the opinion of
the writer.

The a.u.th.or, who is ‘a. member of The NW5 staﬁ along with
numerous other students, does not reflect the opinion of The
l\l'ews_, the student body_. orthe faculty.

To the students and "faculty of the University we off er our
apologies that the opinion ever should have been construed as
tl1eir’s. ‘Rather "than have "this we never would have printed

a slight decrease.

For these corresponding months
the number dropped 0.3 per cent,
while total payrolls fell 0.4 per
cent. Workers employed here in
the past four months numbered
approximately the same as in the
average month of 1928, while com-
bined payrolls have ranged from
about 1 per cent to 3 per cent
above the average month of 1929.

With nearly 12 per cent more
workers having jobs in the Pitts-
burgh rdistri-ct this August than ‘in
August of last year, the bureau al-
so reports an increase of 32.3 per
cent  payrolls in the ﬁrst eight
months of the year over the same
eight months of 1936.

Factory employment declined

gust. Nevertheless, approximate-
ly 17 per cent more people were

 than in August, 1936..

Employment and payrolls of
banks, public utilities, and the
construction industry in Pitts-
burgh increased from July to Au-
gust, whereas employment and
payrolls of railroads and depart-
ment stores showed a decrease, the
bureau stated.

ment of chemistry, spoke over
.sta‘iii:on Kl}-K.A. yesterday after-
noon.

 

The address was given for
the Congress of Clubs and the
club women of Western Pennsyl-
Vania.

Dr. Silverman began his talk,
“Glass and Civilization,” by point-
ing out  many and varied uses
to which glass is put. He went
on to trace the history of the man-
ufacure of glass from Egypt ﬁve
thousand. years ago to Pittsburgh,
:1 leading glass manufacturing dis-
trict in the world, at the present
time.

It was predicted by Dr. Silver-
man that, “Perhaps, the time will
come when glass fabrics can be so
treated that they will be safe for
 apparel.”

In addition, the chemist pointed
out that present day mirrors, be-

cause they have their reflecting-

surface on the rear of the glass,

do not, if the glass is green, truly‘

portray -our complexions.
“Whether aluminum mirrors,
coated on the surface nearest the
observer, will come into commer-
cial use I do not know,” stated Dr.
Silverman, “but when that day
comes, if it comes, we shall really
see ourselves as others see us.”

John Baker Trots Globe, Secs
Chinese Bandits, Jap Suicides

Exchange
Student ‘Spends

Year in China ,

By JEAN BARNES
He was held up by Chinese
bandits, and a fell w rider in the
bus talked the bandits out of rob-
bing them.

This sounds like the beginning’

of a movie thriller, but it isn’t.

lt’s just one of the incidents that

John Paul Baker, BA38, tells
about, now that he’s home from
his year in. China.

For Johnny has had a ‘year at
the University of Canton and he’s
back at Pitt, registering, studying,
and sighing.

During the past year he has

, studied Chinese philosophy, his-

7

tory and civilization, the last of
which is a study of China itself.
' “We didn’t study all the time,”

said Johnny; “in fact the work
was very light. On week-ends we
went on trips through the back
country where very few tourists
ever go. When you stopped to
wa.lkaround a town, you’d have
about two hundred and fifty peo-
ple following you and about ten
dogs.” '

He not only went to the back-
country, but also to Japan, Korea,
Shanghai, Peiping—where he
spent a week—-and on the way
home came past Tibet. While he
was in Japan he saw a Japanese
couple jump off the famous Sui-
cide Leap, where so many lovers
leap to the rocks below.

He also took around 700 snap-

I

0

shots, and 1200 feet of cineﬁlms,
r;a*.1d he carried an exposure filter
——or something-—on his belt.

“The movie ‘The Good Earth’
was not allowed in China,” he said,
“and neither was ‘Lost Horizon.’
But I snuk away to Shanghai to
see that, anyhow.”

He didn’t see any of the war
scenes that we’ve seen in news-
reels over here, but he’s for
China, anyhow, because it’s the
underdog. And he wouldn’t
change a thing about the past
year. And he’s gained around
twenty pounds, and grown an inch.

“What did you do in your spare
time, Johnny, and how do you

‘say ‘I love you’ in Chinese?” we

queried.

“No an noi,” he replied, _h.:irry-
ing away to register for his L'.)IllOlC'
curricula.

Student Poll
To Be Taken
After Concerts

The first of this scas0n’s con-
cert hour progra‘ins will be held
in 2317 Cathedral, two Weeks
from today. A concert‘ of re-
corded music will be given,
with Theodore M. Finney, lecturer
in musical appreciation, giving
short introductory remarks for
cacti composition.

The concert hour committee,
headed by Robert Brown, C39,
plans to make these recorded con-
certs the basis of this season’s
series. From time to time, Uni-
versity student musicians will pre-
sent programs and guest artists
from the newly reorganized Pitts-
burgh Symphony will give solo
recitals. A short series, to be held
later in the semester will present
jazz players of the city demon-
strating how their music came into

» being, what it consists of, and how

 sessions, “breaks,” and
“raggin’ ” are evolved from stand-
ard dance tunes. .,

' REQUEST PROGRAMS

Through a poll. to be taken after
each concert, students may choose
the works they wish to hear at the
next program. The recordings
wi_l_l be sel.ccted from the College
1‘./Iusicr Set, rccciitljz donated to the
University.

This set, containing approxi-
mately 900 discs and scores, was
compiled by the Carnegie Founda-
tion, with the assistance of leading
musicians. Almost every" standard
musical composition of note is in-
cluded, in addition to such anthol-
ogies as “The History of the Song,”

issues Qall
For Stories

Emphasis will be on short stories
and short one-act plays in the
1937-38 Jorneyman, according to
the editor, William Murray, C39.
Jorneyman is also asking for
poems and articles on topics of
current interest. _.

Manuscripts for the ﬁrst issue,
to be published the ﬁrst Week of
December, should be turned in as
soon as possible and must be in by
November 1. They are to be left
at the Journeyman desk in 817 Ca-
thedral.

Murray announces the editorial
board of the Journeyman tain-
clude Peggy Laschinger, ‘ C39;
Robert Brown, C39; and Milton G.
Lehman, C39. Bernard McKenna,
C39, is business manager.

In announcing the new policy
of the magazine Murray . said,
“Students are more interested, I
believe, in a piece of writing that
has a story to tellth-an in a meme
scholarly presentation of the de-
tails that go to make up a wood-
land scene.”

The editor, speaking for the ed-
itorial board, explained that this
does not mean that descriptions
will not be given as much.consid-
eration as any other type of crea-
tive writing. However, the board
does not intend to publish so-
called “theme book” descriptions.

Journeyman, sponsored by Quill
Club, honorary literary fraterni-
ty, will break a precedent this
year by publishing two issues.
Plans call for the ﬁrst issue in De-
cember and the ﬁnal issue in
April. In previous years only one
issue has appeared, usually in the
spring. » f

Book Exchange
To Close Shop

Although still open for business,
the Men’s Council book exchange
today prepared to close its doors.

University students with books
to buy or sell will have from
11:30 to 3:30 p. In. today -to trans-
mit business in the exchange
office, 801 Cathedral.

Robert Fortsythe, C140, chair-
man of the Men’s Council student
loan fund which is in charge of
the book exchange, announced
that several hundred books were
still on hand today with their
owners awaiting buyers. Students
whose books have been sold 

 

be notiﬁed soon, said Forsythe.

Whiiic reviiirigs of rnuiiiiion makers are bccomhig
i"ai;liei: srlitc, is is siiil iriic igliai war is a mac‘r'iina—
inlon of money, fosicred by the few and foisted on
the ni.any..

Ii is siill true that Wlien a lobby of million-
 makes un its collective mind éhat ‘war is
an cconciiiic necessity, such stories as Mr. Knick-
crbocker‘s, a few parades and a couple of ﬁfe
 drum corps can whip up a nation of sup-
posedly iiitcliigeiit peepic to a murderous frenzy.
Unfortunately, this is still true—-though not ad-
r:oii;i;cd by either the lobby or the government
officials concerned.

And when the lobby and the nations Secretary
 l/Var and a few other people have decided that
such a war is necessary, phrases such as “a j‘us“£,
equitable and practical solution of problems” are
the only ‘things left to convince the nation and the j
war i.i“’=t the lobbyisizs are “liuman‘e?” ji§}'2€O‘;'}'l€-.
l“z'll.iSiSOlil1l was tlmnking only of the good of the
umutored savage when he routed  r ifrceiir his ,
throne and l3OIl’1.l’)€‘Cl the Ethiopian l'rospiiﬁ'ai1is.. Andi
§‘i'ance and Germany and Italy are tliiiiikiiigi only 
saving civilization irom each other when they send
airplanes to Spain. And Santa Claus; comes’ down
the chimney every €3Tir'istnias Eve.

Vfell, maybe. Aniyliow, it has never been my idea“
that the man betli-intd the gun was the man behind
the war. War is caused because it will‘ n=ia9k'e
money, because the country needs to lll'CIE'8.‘SE" its
colonies, or because privately-owned pl”O13E1°lZy"YI?i'U?St
be protected for the income ‘tax. '
And what would be the result of suclrr a‘: war,
now, enibroilirig ‘the Uiiitcd States? You: guess; It 2

“While it is true,” said Mr.
Klecb “"liai: in nine out of ten
cases lieard by ‘Eh-3 DILRB, the de-
cision has been against the em-
ployer, it must be remembered
that the Wagner" Act is not a crim-

policy. And that policy is the
thing which  many employers
from engaging in‘ practices which
history has shown crush labor.”

"that when any operations of a bus-

is subject to national regulation
of its labor relations.

“Principles and policies set

‘practically certain to continue as

There will be a  ““n«.ial dif-
ference in the team tteps out
on the field. at l\/{org ..own this
w-eek-end than that which lined

up at the season’s opening kick-
off.

There was really only one out-
standing player in the Pitt for-
ward wall in the Bishop game.
Dante Dalle Tezze is the name and
his play has earned. an advance-
ment for him. Starting as a regu-
lar during the past two seasons,
Dalel Tezze gave way this year to
Steve Pc-tro in the Rose Bowl
game. '

DALIE--TEZZE BACK

Apparen.tly, Dalle Tezze is now
back at his starting post. There is
 strong possibility of a shift on
the other side of the line where Al
Lezouski may replace Walt Ras-
kowski. _

“For two years Don Hesley had
kept a pivot ahead of Heinie Ad-
ams for the center post. When the
season began this year, Adams
had wrested the starting place
away from the blonde senior.

Now, it seems that Hensley is
back in first team harness again.
There has been some indication
that Hensley wil act as captain in
the Mountaineer ﬁasco, being a
West Virginian himself.

MOUNTAINEERS STRONG

‘Sutherland has been sending his
Panthers through an extensive
preparation for Saturday’s en-
counter. He had four scouts down
in the West Virginia hills last week
Watching the Mountaineers in
their ﬁrst game.

Their reports have given the
Panthers sorneihing to think about
in the way of strong opposition.
Sleepy Glenn, one of West Vir-
ginia’s ﬁrst citizens, has a good
offense this year, even though it
was hampered somewhat by fum-
bles last week. Another strong
Mountaineer point is the line.
Glenn has two good lines to work
with this year.

Dr. Carlson Requests
Basketball Entries

If you’ve never played varsity
basketball, but have a curious
hankering to see how good you
are, get into the novice basket-
ball tournament. f you have al-
ways wanted to play varsity ball,
but have never ‘had the chance to
show your stuff, get into the nov-
ice basketball tournament. Or if
you just want some good sport,
and plenty of exercise, Dr. H. C.
Carlson, varsity coach, invites you
to get into the novice tourney.

floor, under the eye of Dr. Carlson
and several of the varsity play-
ers. Not only the unknowns, but
freshmen who have signiﬁed their
intention trying to make the fresh-
men team, will do well to get into
the fray. Because it will give the
opportunity for_ some real prac-
tice before actual team sessions
get under way.

Incidentally, Dr. Carlson points
out that several captains of teams
in former years were discovered
inithe novice tournament. They
‘had no intentions of trying to play
varsity ball. Among these were
Arjrtura, Wunderlich and Roderick
inj‘I.ecent years.

Fundamentals

“l’m tickled to death with the
turnout, the material, and the
prospects.” Thus Coach Harvey
looker summed up his reaction to
lVfon.day’s first practice of the
junior varsity football team.

A thorough knowledge of basic
fundamentals, the core of Suther-
land styled football machines, is
the first step for the football green
squad. Made up of physical edu-
cation majors, pre-meds, pre-
dentals, and others of the student
body the aspirants must learn to
tackle and block before going on
into football intricacies.

To help him, Rooker has a staff
of physical education majors, who
have already made a ripple in col-
legiate football. Frank Patrick,
Bill Stapulis, Frank Souchak,
George Musulin, Albert Walton,
Michael Radvansky, Paul Shaw,
and Willard Curry are the assist-
ant coaches. Thus the junior var-
sity will also serve in giving the
phys ed majors actual coaching
experience.

The first scrimmage will be held
the ﬁrst of next week. Rooker
has little over three weeks to whip

Foes

Several of Pitt’s 1937-38 oppon-
ents saw action Saturday. All of
them, excepting the young Penn
State aggregation, were victorious.

Coach Clipper Smitn’s Duquesne
team ran up a 33 to 7 win over
Waynesburg. All the pre-season
chatter about the Night Rider’s
gang of talented halfbacks was not
just so much hot air. They are
every bit as good as the publicity
chefs have boasted.

_ , ,_ The Penn State-Cornell contest
1 to 5 inclusive‘, on the Trees gym

was a thriller, according to reports,
from start to ﬁnish. Local grid
fans, probably hoping for a State
victory, placed. the odds on the
Lions. This corner selected the
Cornellians, and Cornell it was-
26 to l9.

Consens'.s of opinion is that the
Lions v.7.¥.l7. improve as the s—:—:ason
progresses. They have plenty of
material, and wh they lack in
heft, they more than make up in
ﬁght. Pitt will get n:r.ore than a
workout when they meet the State
boys.

Olsonmen Face
Tough X-Country
Card This Fall

At just about the time that you
are sitting down to supper tonight
a pack of boys in track clothes
will come jogging in through the
dusk to ﬁnish another daily
scamper over the hills and dales
of Schenley Park.

No matter how suspicious their
actions may be, they are not any
of Bernarr McFadden’s health ad-
dicts nor are they interested in na-
ture study. They’re Coach Carl
Olson’s 1937 Panther cross coun-
try squad and they are preparing
for a tough eight meet schedule
that demands plenty of practice
over the Schenley Park course.

Although he has a large squad
out for the sport, Coach Olson is
still looking for more runners, ‘for
as he explains it, “There are al-
ways the junior varsity and fresh-
man squads to complete.”

TOUGH SCHEDULE

Realizing that he has a tough
schedule, Olson is wasting no time
in getting his varsity squad lined
up and in shape. Last Saturday
morning he held the first trial run
of the year. Al Zamborski step-
ped across the ﬁnish line first,
running the four mile run in
twenty-ﬁve minutes and thirty
seconds. The Kopec brothers ﬁn-
ished right behind Zamborski,
Casimer taking second and Ben
third. John Emens, Robert Cogs-
well, Bob Sepic, Ken Gust and Joe
Kristufek ﬁnished in the order
named after the Kopec brothers.

Olson is already forming plans
for the makeup of his varsity
squad and said that the first six
men to ﬁnish last Saturday get
the six varsity berths.

ners in the country never knew
what a track suit was until they
entered college. Every year at the
novice tournaments we uncover

all become winners, furnish val-
uable material for our varsity and

“Because a boy did not run in
high school he needn’-t think that
we don”: want him to enter the
novice tournament” ﬁnished Coach
Olson.

Some valuable Panther track
material has been uncovered in
past tournaments and Olson is
loking forward to this year’s edi-
tion to turn up some unknown
runners for his freshman and var-
 teams. But whether a winner
or not, Coach Olson promises a lot
of fun and good fellowship for all
boys who enter.

SUITS AVAILABLE I

novice meet, and James Potts, as-
sistant track coach, will be in the

INTEREST IN STUDENTS

Mr. Saunders said that alumni
watch with interest student ac-
complishments in every line of
activity. The Alumni Association
feels that it is of mutual value for
the students to know the alumni
and their accomplishments, and
for the alumni to know the stu-
dents, he added.

Next month the Association will
conduct a campaign to enlist 4,000
members in Allegheny county.
Chairman for the drive is Robert
R. G-aw, ’l4, treasurer of the as-
sociation.

However, in “Ceiling Zero” the
action ranges from crisp humor to
tense drama. The play concerns
airplane pilots.

ACCENT ON YOUTH

In “Accent on Youth,” the dra-
matic element enters strongly, as
the play concerns itself with the
love of a young girl for an older
man. Reaching a high philosoph-
ical plane, “Accent on Youth”
makes an excellent college play.

At a meeting Monday, Oscar
Goodstein, C38, president of the
Players, outlined plans to over
one hundred members of the or-
ganization. Named to head vari-
ous committees were: A Helen
Akerman, C38, vice president, in
charge of the social committee;
Irving Bennett, C40, publicity;
James Davis, C39, business man-
ager, in charge of reception com-
mittee; Rex Loder, C40, and
Shirley Rugh, C38, heading pro-
gram and entertainment; Mae
Shafer, Ed39, and Betty Brooke,
BA38, in charge of costumes and
props; and Sylvia Wasserman
heading the oﬂice group.

Refractories

A new series of super refractor-
ies adapted particularly for use in
high temperature furnaces and in
contact with corrosive materials
has been developed recently at
Mellon Institute, according to an
announcement made today by Dr.
E. R. Weidlein, director of the In-
stitute.

These new refractories, which
have been given the trade name,
“Monofrax,” were evolved through
the research of Dr. A. P. Thomp-
son, incumbent of the Abrasive
Fellowship, in cooperation with
the research laboratories of The
Carborundum Company.

Several large scale installations
of “Monofrax” have already been
made in the construction of glass
melting furnaces and of furnaces
for the handling of molten slag..<
The performance of these refrac-
tories has been outstandingly suc-
cessful and it is expected that
these materials will ﬁnd much
wider application in the erection

of other types of furnaces.
