Educational Television and Radio Center in Ann Arbor,
‘Mich., has granted $3920 to the University for the purpose
of conducting research on problems of educational television.
“*0 This money is being used.to

help ﬁnance the intensive survey
of the ’ television audience in
metropolitan Pittsburgh, empha-
sizing the extent to which the
public watches. educational pro-
grams on WQED;
The project, headed by Dr.
Howard Rowland, associate pro-
fessor of sociology, is concerned
with determining the practical
and potential value of the tele-
vision medium as an education-
al means. _

Dr. Rowland’s committee is
gathering data by house-to-house
interviews with district residents.
University of Pittsburgh students
are conducting these interviews.

Area residents are being polled
as to the extent of TV set owner-
ship, their viewing habits, their
acceptance of educational TV by

QED, and their preferences for
future QED programs.
Purpose of these audience

surveys is to analyze not only
the current impact of education-
al TV on a cross section of the
local population.

The survey will also d-etcr~-

Four Plays
Noon. Show

Midday Series will feature
the Netherlands String Quar-
tet Friday, Feb. M, at noon
and 3 pm. in the Student
Union ballroom.

The ensemble, which made
its debut in 1952 in the Concert-
gebouw of Amsterdam, is_ making
its ﬁrst American tour. The suc-
cess of its inaugural performance
led to the quartet’s appearance at
the 1952 Holland Festival.

Members of the musical group
Klijn, ﬁrst violin, who

ensemble; Jaap Schro-

are Nap de
formed the

der, second violin; Paul Godwin. I

viola; and Carel Boomkamp, cello.

Original Plans Altered

The American tour of the string
quartet was originally scheduled
to follow that of the Amsterdam
Duo, a sonata team, consisting of
Nap de Klijn a_nd his wife, Alice
Heksch. The death of Madame
Heksch, Mozart piano performer,
last August, necessitated a change
in plans.

The Dutch Government has
aided The Netherlands String
Quartet in fulfilling the engage-
ments made for the Amsterdam
Duo. ’.

Since ‘its ﬁrst performance the
musical group has toured Switzer-
land, England, Germany, and

\ South Africa as well as the Neth-

erlands.

Performed For’BBC

In 1953 the British Broadcasting
Company invited the, quartet, as
the ﬁrst overseas ensemble, to
perform in a television program
relayed from Goldsrnith’s Hall,
London.

In 1957 the musicians played at
the King’s Festival.

According to a recent review
in the London Times, “The
magniﬁcent playing of the
—i)utch ensemble not only
achieves a remarkable unity,
but devotes itself to music-
making with an especially re-
freshing vigor.”

The Het Trouw, an Amsterdam
paper, praises the Netherlands
String Quartet thus: “This en-
semble marches rapidly to the
front ranks of the world’s great
international groups. Its interpre-
tations can only be called sub-
lime.”

posed of district educators.

Explains Group Formation ‘

In welcoming the Commission
to this ﬁrst”—meeting, Chancellor
Litchﬁeld outlined the thinking

’ which led to the formationof the

group. -

He said thatpthe Commission
was invited to make its study,
not out of a sense of criticism’
of other aspects of education;
such as the secondary schools
and liberal arts colleges, but out
of a need which" the University
itself felt to analyze and further,
deﬁne its own role in the great
upper Ohio Valley region. '

To Report Progress ’
According to Dr. Charles Peake,
chairman of the Commission, and

Dr. J. Steel Gow, ,Jr., director,
this initial meeting was an intro-

ductory and organizational meet-
ing. From time to time reports on
the progress of the Commission’s

study will be published.

‘Chancellor Litchﬁeld express-
ed the hope that the Commis-

sion will involve as many indi- ‘

viduals and grouns as possible
in the whole study.

He further stated, “Our only
success can come through wide-
spread involvement and under-
standing‘ of needs and answers
to these needs.”

The Commission members are
Dr. Earl Dimmick, stiperintenclent,
Pittsburgh Public Schools; Dr. Al-
fred Beattie, superintendent, Alle-
gheny County Schools. *

dent, Mount Lebanon Township

Rebels Witlmut Cause

Chancellor Litchﬁeld is not well liked by the majority
ofundergraduates in this University. a A

This fact is demonstrated daily by letters and visitors
to this ofﬁce and by a mass campaign of furtive discussion
in all areas of the campus including the classrooms.

This disfavor is the result of a sequence of events many
of which were beyond Litchﬁeld’s control. There can be no
simple or single motive for his unpopularity. It has its roots
in a tangle of apprehensions and preconvictions.

It has resulted in the use of Litchﬁeld the man as a
scapegoat for opposition to all change in the University.

With the announcement of the appointment of the pres-
ent Chancellor came enough advanced publicity to rival the
recent visit of Queen Elizabeth. This ballyhoo included
splashes on the Chancellor’s “company” A as it has been
termed.

On the crest of these previews of coming attractions, a
Saturday Evening Post article proclaimed the “demands”
that Litchﬁeld made in the acceptance of his office.

Long before he came here the seeds of passive opposi-
tion to the “New Administration” had been sown.

During the summer of 1956 the ﬁres were lighted in
many areas -of resistance and students talked of the
“brash young man” who was coming straight from.govern-
ment bureaucracy to the University campus.

Then the contrasts between the new and the old were
being spotlighted. They charged that this “imposter” re-
quired a ﬁne home, private plane, a private pilot, and chaf-
feur. ,

With each new item of information the word spread
andthe whisperers began to speak more loudly and ‘more
often. ' ’

N When he was named to head the board of Smith-Corona,
the Chancellor became to many an image of “Big Business”
which can only be matched by pre-trustbusting cartoon ﬁg-
ures.. _

His name was synonymous with the factory system and
corporate education. : ‘

It was not a result of this appointment that Litchﬁeld
was thus labeled but the appointment added to the deep-
ening impression that Pitt people had about him.

Now with each reform or attempt at changethe opposi-
tion is ready-made. The opinion has been formed for close
to two years. Minds have clanged shut and will not open
for their own beneﬁt.

Each new. idea, whether encouraged by the Chancellor
or not, is attributed to him, and consequently rejected first

i and considered later.

Public opinion—ﬁckle, unreasoning thing that it is—has
come to stand in judgement with the verdict reached before
the charge.

Ridiculous demands have been made of the man. People »

who never paid much mind to the absence or presence of
former administrators at University functions be.came
acutely aware of the actions of the Chancellor.

Last fall they ridiculed him publicly in the stadium

before the major. It was not only opposition to increased
, tuition that was prompting the boos and catcalls but it was a

basic opposition to the man.
The reasons for this derision are multitude. The results
are obvious. The remedy is nearly impossible.
A new policy of .“humanizing” the man will seem in-
sincere and_ probably be rejected.
A A better solution would be to make the students aware

of the activities and programs the chancellor has undertak- '

en in connection with his job as head of this institution.
But even this will take; time.

Education In Transition . . .

The Muddle Of Activitie

(Editor’s Note——This is the fourth in a series of
columns on contemporary education at the Univer-
sity.) A

By David Breakstone

The role of extra-curricular activities, a second
aspect of the liberal education, is becoming more
controversial at the University. Because of the

Goliathan proportions of the athletic side of this,

subject,
week.
To attempt a deﬁnte esti-
mate of the activities program is
next to impossible. It would be
difficult to include every stu-
dent program, and harder still
to evaluate the merits of each.
In addition, the amorphous
structure of Pitt activities

sports will be handled separately next

8

by anyone. Only the high spots
of the situation, will‘ be ex-
amined. ' _ .

Student governing bodies are
directly responsible for the welfare of an activities
program. Student Congress, Men’s Council, and
Associated Women Students are the three govern-
ment organizations here with supposedly parallel
responsibilities.

Few students are aware of the authority of MC
and AWS and accordingly, their functions have
been reduced to insigniﬁcance. That leaves Con-
gress with the job of making things go. Unfortun-
ately, it doesn’t and cannot fulﬁll this obligation.

SC has no power. It doesn’t tax, it can’t allocate
funds, and it rarely legislates positively. The
members of SC are termed the best student leader-
ship in the school, but they are powerless to act.

As The«P.itt News pointed out on December 18,
1957, there will be no effective re-organization of
SC until that body gets a voice in the distribution

‘ of the high $24 per semester University Fee which
each student tosses into the mysterious “kitty.” The

current crippled SC is notable only for its lack
of unity and as a target for student derision. Un-
less SC makes strident demands for authority
soon, future governing bodies will be “lame ducks”
before the ﬁrst gavel sounds.
Strata of Authority i ' A

With SC incapacitated as it presently is, the
whole program of activities remains muffled under
administrative control which is rigidly enforced.
The stratification of program authority in the Ca-
thedral results in friction and narrowness of func-
tion.

Dr. Charles Peake, vice chancellor for student
affairs, is aware of the discordant situation. His

first major move to remedy the problem was the’

Sex, Sports, Songs . . .

 

 

\

formation of the Student Affairs Board. .

But this stop—gap forum will only be beneﬁcial
if it approves autonomous student activities. A new
watered-down form of the present “controlled
economy” will eventually lead up the same blind
alley.

The liberal concept of education stresses in-
dividual freedom, the kind of freedom which per-
mits student initiative in scholastic pursuits and
extra-curricular endeavor. If the belief now held
is that undergraduates cannot manage their own
activities completely, including ﬁnances, it is a
misguided one.

Activities by Student Control

' The campuses around the country which €13-j
joy the greatest scope of student activities are ’

those which are completely student-controlled.

Only when undergraduates are assured’ of their
independence in their own activities can they as-
sume the responsibility whichgoes with democratic
self-government.

Despite the handicaps of the present self—de—
feating system, the University boasts a varied ex-
tra-curricular set-up—-everything from bridge to
band music. Variety in itself, however, does not
necessarily imply excellence,

If truth is a useful commodity, then it is politic
to state that only in the publications ﬁeld and the
William Pitt Debate Union is top—notch work ac-
complished. (Even the former mentioned could

“use some tightening up!) ,

The deﬁcit in other organizations is mainly a
lack of forceful student participation.

‘ Goodbye Mr. BMOC _(

No student affairs program can ever become
the organic part of the education process that it
should be until wide—spread participation is ef-
fected.

The present policy of “one man with his ﬁngers
in eleven pies” is a poor one. These “activities won-
ders” do little good for any of their multifarious
organizations. The Greeks, fraternities and sorori-
ties, have dominated activities for years.

They have tended_ to pass the leadership from
“brother to brother.” Too many times the Greeks
have been interested merely in organization ‘titles
and have neglected to share in the actual work.

With the advent of the Student Union, it has
been interesting to watch ,the return of many stu-
dents to a central campus‘ gathering spot.

The Union mayprove to be an effective answer
to Greek domination, if it continues its wise pdlf-A
icies toward University unity. The Schenley House
and Brackenridge Hall dormitories are another po-
tential source of total campus activities.

The opportunity for Ca signiﬁcant contribution
remains.

Student Union Follies  

(Edito'r’s Note——Most of those who read this col-
umn will think it is exaggerated. The others may
have been there when it happened.)

By Murray Chass

A boy and a girl were studying for their French
ﬁnal. Before them a spectacular was unleashed.
Surely, they thought to themselves, the Big Top
was back in business

For in the circus that was about to be presented
in the Student Union Lounge, all that was missing
was P. T. Barnum to announce
through his magaphonez‘
“Laadeeez and gentlemen, pre-
senting the University of Pitts-
burgh Student Union’s Three-
Ring Circus.”

And the circus began. As in
all top-notch three-ring pro-
ductions, attention was ﬁrst

main attraction. This act was
staged on the couch in the di-
rect center of the Lounge, down
the steps from the middle entrance, and involved
one defense—minded boy and one aggressive girl.
The main theme of the act was the boy’s futile,
but nevertheless persistent, attempts to restrain
the girl from crawling all over him. There were
the times when she took a rest-—for instance when
someone at the piano struck up a number,of the
roaring ’twenties and she jumped up and did the
Charleston, or when she stooped to put on her
boots. But each time she returned to the couch and
her friend.
Love In the Afternoon
For a part of the time the girl was sitting in
such a position next to the boy that her tight dress
was pulled up to the top of her nylon stockings
(and she wasn’t wearing knee stockings either).
She didn’t even pay any attention to her girl
friend who was sitting next to her, taking it all in.
iOne can only wonder if this performance in

Over in the left ring a few of Pitt’s most ma-
ture football players, probably inﬂuenced by all
the recent out-of-season baseball talk, ~were sen.
gaged in an early Spring training baseball game.
(The players shall be nameless for fear we will
start a rivalry between Panther baseball coach Bob
Lewis and John Michelosen.) A
Casey’ At The Bat V

One of the players stood at the top of the steps
and did the pitching. Another stationed himself
across from the piano in a catcher’s position, And
then, of course, there was the batter, who swung
from the right side.

The players were not using the regulation ball
made by Spalding, but instead used a new type of
sphere——crumbled-up wax paper balls. After the
batter hit the ball (with his hand), naturally he
ran around the bases. That’s what the instructions
of the game say should be done. The instructions
don’t say, though,» that the runner should almost
knock over a Union lamp as he rounds ﬁrst base,
which our speed) ball player did.

And ﬁnally, the runner (luckily wasn’t wearing
his spikes) showed how much time he must have.

And Assorted Short Subiects

Across the room, _in the right ring, a couple of
minor games were being played. In‘ one of the
corners of the ring a group of fellows were stoop-
ing down, rolling ping pong balls against the wall
and into ash trays. Every time one of them hit
the designated mark, a loud cheer went up.

In the other corner of the ring some other fel-
lows had devised another new and deﬁnitely ex-
citing sport. This was “Kick the Ash Tray.” The
game consisted of taking ash trays off the tables

SO HUMBLE

Today let us apply the hot wliitelight of sustained thinking to
the greatest single problem bcsetting American colleges. I refer,

, of course, to homesickness.

It is enough to rend the heart, " walking along a. campus at
night and listening to entire dormitories sobbing themselves to
sleep. And in the morning when the poor, lorn students rise
from their tea.r—stained pallets and refuse their breakfasts and
shamble oh" to class; their lips trembling, their eyelids gritty,
it is enough to turn the bones to aspic. ' e E '

Whatican be done to overcome homesickness‘? Well sir, the
obvious solution is for the student to put his home on rollers
and bring it to college with him. This, however, presents three"

serious problems:

ling for tjie Blue and Gold with a
score of 253. This was the second
best performance of his career.
Joe‘ Battaglia took second place
while the third and fourth posi-
tions were won by Joe Gray and
Bob Eicholtz of the visitors. V

Sophomore John Marcinko of
initial
first place of the season as he
tallied‘ 191 points to win the
side horse. Mulvihill was close

Darling was ﬁrst with a 249. Mul-
vihill had 235 for second, and
Marcinko ﬁnished third with a

227 total. Larry Fitzgerald of the’

Indians wound up fourth.

time of 4.6 seconds. Battaglia was
second and Sophomore John Fel-
man was third.

. Mulvihill gained his only ffirst

a rule is an unpredictable sport. Anyone

prone to making long—range predictions is usually doomed to
disillusion. However, a great number of “seers” at the begin-
ning of the currentcampaign predicted that the Panther
hoopsters would only begin to roll about the last quarter of

the season.
These wise men have been

.proven correct, for as the Blue

and Gold ﬂoormen invade Beaver

‘Falls tonight to engage the Geneva

Covies they are sporting a
good 12-5 record. The locals own
a ﬁve game winning streak, the
last four of which were gained .on

With this_ late spurt, the Sky-
scrapermen are duplicating the
performance of last year’s team
which mysteriously “found itself”
late in the season and went on to
become a dark horse candidate in
the NCAA tournament.

Team Statistics Favorable

The Panthers invasion of Ann-

scale. In addition to the basket-

is sending the Gymnastics squad,

The locals have committed 385

Grady Predicts
Swimmers Fate
In Navy Contest

BY JOHN SULLIVAN

On Saturday, the Panther
swimmers‘ travel to Annapolis
where they will try topavenge
a 75-11 trouncing they receiv-
ed from the Middies last year.

Coach Ben Grady who prov-
ed to be somewhat of a prophet
last year when he said that Navy
would dominate the Panther-
Middy meet by capturing ﬁrst
place in most of the events pre-
dicted a similar fate this year. The
indications are, however, that the

46-40, and North Carolina State
57-29, while losing to V.M.I.
54-32, Ohio University 46-22,
Lehigh 48-38, and Army 60-25,
would have to be classiled as a
major upset, however.

The Midshipmen, coached by

John Higgins, are reported to have

as ﬁne a squad as the one from
last season and that one captured
ﬁrst places in all ten events in
the meet.

Even the Panthers crack 400
yard relay team may ﬁnd the
swimming a little rough this week.
The quartet consisting of Willis
Weisz, Chuck Nanz, E u_ g e n e
Adams, and Ken Cooper set a new
school record of 4214.4 earlier this
year, but against the Jungle Cats
last year the Navy medley relay
team splashed through their spec-
iality in 4:01.1.

Matmen In Homestretch

With Meet At Annapolis

By JIM LACEY
The Panther Wrestlers have come home from a disas-
trous mid-west trip only to be faced with the immediate
problem of disposing of Navy, Lehigh, and Penn State in

that order.

The trip was one that will be remembered a long time
in the minds of the Panthers. They lost their ﬁrst meet to

Iowa State, 22-5, and in the vic-9

tory over Mankato State, 17-11,
they lost Tom Alberts, the 167
lb. national champ.

Albert’s shoulder was dislocated
and he may be lost for the re-
mainder of the season. Ot Illinois,
the matmen fared better with a
16-14 win.

Stremic Wrestles Heavyweight

Saturday night the Matmen
travel to Navy where they will
try for their eighth win in nine

‘starts. The Middies of Ray Swartz

have a 3-0-2 slate. Tl..ey edged
Gettsburg, Columbia, and Lehigh.
while Maryland and Penn State
held them to a 14-14/tie.

Tony Stremic, the football
player, will head thelist of re-
tnrnees. Stremic was the run-
ner-up to Ron Schirf of the
Panthers in the 191 class in
both'the Eastern and Nationals.
In dual-meet competition he
will handle the heavyweight
slot. ‘ l

Five other lettermen round out
the returnees. Bob Green (130)
and Joe Longton (137) will
strengthen the ,.lighter weights.
Along withdstremic, Pete Fried-
man (167) and Doug Voglenau
(177) will hold down the heavier
slots.

Powell Stars

. Other weight classes will be
ﬁlled by non-lettermen. Walker
Ulhorn (123), Dick Johnson’ (147),
and Chuck Larson (157) will be
Coach Swartz’s nomination for the
weight classes vacated\by grad-
uates.

Coach Rex Peery will send a
doctored line-up to meet the
Middies. Paul Powell (123), the
sensational sophomore, w i l 1
lead-off and try to keep his un-
beaten -ecord intact. Powell
has a 7-0-1 score card, the only
Panther to go unscathed in the
mid-west trip. - 

Powell has become Coach

Peery’s favorite topic, these past
weeks. .Peery said enthusiastically,
“Powell has been the surprise of
the season and has done some ﬁne
work showing much promise since
he is only a sophomore.”
Skirpan Replaces Alberts

Bob Irwin (130) with a 2-2
card and Vic DeFelice (137),
6-1-1, will take care of the light

weights while‘ Ted Bienkowski
(147) and Bob Richardson (157)
handle the middle weights. Bien-
kowski has a 3-4 record while

‘ALEX SKIRPAN
Replaces Injured Alberts

Richardson has a 5-2-1. ,-

Dave Johnson, 7-1, will wres-
tle at 167 while Alex Skirpan
subs for the ailing Alberts in
the 177 pound class. Tom Hall
will do duty in the heavy-
weight slot. Skirpan is 3-5-
while Hall is 0-2.

In earlier meets, on Jan. 18 and
Feb. 1 the locals easily downed
Syracuse 20-5 and Lock Haven
23-3. The Panthers have so far
won ﬁve of eight matches from
the, Orange while drawing one.
Against Lock Haven, the Blue and
Gold have copped seven out of
eight dual meets. A victory by
Bob Benson in the Heavyweight
Division over Skirpan averted a
shut-out over the Eagles.

VOLLEYBALL

All Sophomores, Juniors, and '
Seniors are invited to try out for ‘

the Volleyball -Team. Interested
students may contact Mr. Bemis

Hoop Follows
Big Time Grid

By‘ ED KOLTISKA
Sports Editor

 

It looks like the Panthers are taking another jump into
bigtimle athletics. Instead of football, it is now basketball. To
prove the point, the Jungle Cats have received feelers from
both the NCAA and NIT officials for the second straight year.

Last year the Locals accepted the NCAA bid and put on
a mighty ﬁne performance before submitting to Kentucky
98-92. The game was played on Kentucky’s home court which

is normally a six point advantage to start. The Kentuckians .

needed this and all the luck they could muster to edge the
Panthers in the ﬁnal minutes, of the game.

 In fact all the games wcreclose ones. The Panthers elimi-
nated thehighly rated Morehead State 86-85 and.,then edged
Notre Dame in the consolation match by the same score 86185.

If the Jungle Cats do receive bids from both Tourna-

ments, there willgbe a leaning, towards the NCAA offer
rather than the NIT bid. So far the Hoopsters have shown
better‘ form in the National Tourney than they have in the
Holiday Festival’ Exhibition in New York, although losing
in both. I I ’

Before any bids can be discussed further, one or two other
things have to happen such as winning a few more games, es-
pecially the West Virginia tilt, and showing ﬁne form in doing so.

The National Tournament will undoubtedly be the

tougher of the two. Teams at large, such as the Panthers,

-- have to play elimination rounds before reaching the playoff

stages whereas conference winners go right into the quarter-
ﬁnals. , “

If the Locals do enter the NCAA with hopes of staying
away from the New York Gardens ﬂoor, they are in for a
surprise. Lew Andreas, Syracuse Athletic Director and Chair-
man of the NCAA’s eastern selection committee stated that
the eastern selection would enter the Regional playoffs at
Madison Square Gardens. This eliminates the Panthers hopes
of going straight to the West for eliminations like they did
last year. __ , B‘ ’ A

There happens to be. an important reason why the players
shy away fromi New York. It-isn’t because of the ﬂoor or the
oﬁiciating but because they have too much unorganized free time
in the big city. While the teampwas up there during the Christmas \

_ Holidays, the morale factor was at its lowest point. _,

The players had six days to while away with games
being played every other day. Since it was Christmas, most
of the players were ﬁnancially embarrassed and could not
really go out to see anything because of the high cost of
living there. The athletic department did not provide any
sightseeing tours- or tickets to shows. Most of thetime was
spent idly in the hotel or pounding the pavements, It’s no
wonder that the team played below average ball and muttered
openly that they did not liketplaying in the big city.

~ A little organization here and there may have changed 

the whole outlook of the players and provided them with a
little incentive to do a good job instead of inviting them to

look forward to the trip home and a comfortable daily-

routine. Perhaps this may be kept in lmind on the next

‘T extended road trip that the Panthers partake. ‘

Panthers ‘Receive

Tourney Feelers

  FY0111 NCAA, NIT

NCAA and NIT feelers have
been extended to ‘the Panther
hoopsters now that the team is
nearing the home stretch boasting
a 12-5 record. .

Frank Carver, Graduate Man-
ager of Athletics, has officially
announced that feelers were ex-
tended this past weekend but the
actual ‘bids are not expected for
another week depending on the
outcome of the next four games.

If both bids come forth, Car-
vendeclined to mention which
of the .two the Athletic Depart-
ment will accept. Last year the
Jungle Cats made a good show-
ing in the NCAA’s by squeez-
ing past 'Morehead State 86-85
before dropping a close one to
Kentucky 98-92. ,

So far this season, the Panthers
have had trouble on the New
York floor where the NIT tourna-
ment is played. In the Holiday
Festival tournament, the locals
lost two while layingnclaim to
only one victory. In all three
games, the Panthers played below
average basketball that brought
forth much criticism from the
New York writers.

Regardless, the Jungle Cats
may not be able to escape playing
at Madison Square Gardens for
the’ Eastern Regional NCAA play-
offs are also held at the Gardens.

In free time Bob enjoys hunting.
On evenings out he likes dancing,

Richardson says,- “Although
our wrestling‘ team has been

small _number of people attend
the meets. The team gets lit-

I wouldn’t be surprised if some
people’ didn’t even know there

Although the season is young,

Bob has done well in his first few

matches, Coach Rex Perry is de-
pending upon ‘Richardson to be a
strong man on his team. From all
indications, he will not let him
down.

at the Field House 601/2 to 351/2. The Panthers have defeated
Lock Haven, Syracuse, and Temple while losing only to

Army. ,

Coach Warren Neiger’s ﬁne squad was able to take down

first place in every event with theﬁ

exception of the side horse. The
only double winner of the meet
was the Panthers Tom Darling
who scored ﬁrsts on the high bar
and ﬂying rings.

Don Neeld won the tumbling
event with a score of 255. This
was his highest point accumula-
tion of the season.

“I think Don is improving in
every rmeet and stands an excel-
lent chance to win the Easterns
this year,” commented Coach
Neiger.

Cacolice, Battaglia Tie.

Marty Nayowith of Temple
took first place on the side horse
with a score of 224. The Panther’s
Don Kasner was "a close second

the high bar. Darling was the in-‘-
dividual winner with a 267 total.
