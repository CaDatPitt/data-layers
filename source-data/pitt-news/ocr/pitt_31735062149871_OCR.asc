Seminar Meets

Dr. John W. Oliver, professor and
head of the department of history
and president of the Social Science
seminar, has called the ﬁrst regular
meeting of the seminar for tonight.

scene of the regular meetings.

Tonight’s speaker, A. P. James,
professor of history, has prepared a
paper on “"l‘he University of Pitts-
burgh in the First World War.”

member of the staff. This is the
ﬁrst of five papers on the subject
of national defense and world in-
terests with general reference to
Pittsburgh.

Professor James states that the
seminar is “tentatively attempting
to harmonize their program with
present local and world situations
by giving attention to national de-
fense activities. and potential re-
sources of the city.”

University Press to Release
Book by Randolph Downs

“Council Fires on the Upper
Ohio,” written by Dr. Randolph C.
Downes, will be released by the
University of Pittsburgh Press next
Tuesday. , , '

The book is the culmination of
research which Dr. Downes began
while holding a fellowship with the
Social Science Research council. It
was completed under the direction
of the Vvestern Pennsylvania His-
torical survey.

This book is the ninth of a series
written under the direction of the
Western Pennsylvania Historical
survey, and co-sponsored by the
Buhl foundation, the Historical So-
ciety of Western Pennsylvania, and
the University.

The story of the conquest of the
Iipncr Cihit. v:~.ll.c.y is not new. but
heretofcre- it has been told from the
white man’s point of view, without
real consideration of the point of
view of the Indian. In “Council
Fires on the Upper Ohio” an in-
terpretation of the Indian viewpoint
is presented.

Dr. -Downes maintains, in his
book, that the Indian civilization of
early western Pennsylvania was
neither better nor worse than that
of the white man.

The history of the region was the
history of relationship between the
Indians and the whites. The In-
than was a diplomat in his own
right. For nearly half a century
he maintained a precarious hold on
Western Pennsylvania by the ex-
pedient of playing oﬁ one white
faction against another, first the
French against the British, then
the British against the Americans.

“Council. Fires on the Upper
Ohio” portrays a spectacle that is
unusual in the history of any civ-
il.ization——»the spectacle of one civil-
ization in conflict with another, and
the p1'ocess of c.h'.mination of the
one. This conflict was born of the
utter incompatibility of two differ-
ent sets of folkways, and it was
nourished by the profound convic-
tion of each race, that its ways were
superior to those of the other.

Holiday on October 16.

Forﬂegistration Day 

Move to Comply

With Governor’s

Official Order -

A full holiday hasbeen de-
clared for all day and evening
students at the University on
VVednesday, .October 16, in order
to facilitate’registration of men
for selective service.

University officials announced that
no classes will be held in order to
comply with the spirit and purpose
of Governor Arthur James’ procla-
mation setting October 16 as a legal
holiday.

The suspension of classes will en-
able all male students and faculty
members within the age range of
21 through 35 years to comply with
the provisions of the Federal Se-
l.ective Training and Service act of
1940.

Originally a conference of deans
had decided to make the registra-
tion day a half holiday with classes
adjourning at 12:30 o’clock. The
new announcement changes this to
a full day holiday.

In his proclamation, Governor
James said: “In order to indicate
more fully to our citizens the ne-
cessity of complying with the reg-
istration regulations, and in order
to bring more fully and more forci-
bly to the attention of our people
the grave signiﬁcance of what is
transpiring, I call upon all of the
school directors, board members,
and officials in Pennsylvania to close
the schools on Registration day,
October 16.”

While this proclamation did not
speciﬁcally mention colleges, the
University is complying with the
provisions of the declaration. It is
expected that Carnegie Tech and

.Duquesne. will also declare a holi-
‘day on October 16.

Ruggero Aldisert, C41, editor of
the Pitt News, has stated that there
will be no issue of the News on the
holiday. Publication will resume
with the issue of Friday, October 18.

Bring ‘Scare-snap’
To Saturday Game

,Gents, you might have slipped
your best non-Pitt girl into the

activities book, but for the South-
ern Methodist game Saturday you
had better date a. Pittite. The
primary reason being that identiﬁ-
cation cards will be required for
admittance.

Those whose initials run from
A to G received the shock yester-
day, today students whose initials
run from H to N have their ego
deﬂated, and tomorrow the O to Z
group will have grounds for ha.ri-
ka-ri.

Cards are being distributed from
the alcove opposite the book store
on the first ﬂoor. ,

Students in the professional
schools, Law, Medicine, Pharmacy,

cards at their respective dean’s

Pitt Gets Many Gifts, Endowments

Approximately $590,000 was given
to the University last year through
gifts and endowments, most of
which came from private sources.

According to the latest issue of
Pitt, quarterly-published magazine
of the University, the largest gift
of the University was received from
the Buhl foundation to expand so-
cial service work training in the
School of Applied Social Sciences.

Intended to answer the question
of how to help the University,
which, according to an editor's note,
was asked by alumni and other in-
terested persons, the article listed
four endowments for scholarships
and fellowships. The endowments

totaled $18,400, the largest donation
of $9,329 being received from the
bequest of the late Mary Sloan.
Other scholarships, not mentioned
in the article, were said to be given
directly to students.

Aside from the monetary gifts to
the University, a clock, made in the
s»-pare time of William R. Ludwig
during the 50 years he was em-
ployed in the Allegheny observe.-
tory and at the University, was
given to the University Seismologi-
cal observatory.

An extraordinarily accurate time-
piece, the clock shows a maximum
error of 25 seconds per year.

A lace parasol of 1866, donated by

Miss Mary B. Wolff, will be dis-
played in the cabinet on the wom-
en’s ﬂoor of the Cathedral when it
is ﬁnished. The cabinet will con-
tain other memorials of the life of
women of western Pennsylvania.

Other articles in the magazine,
whose theme is the Common Room
gate, concerned University advance-
ments and additions. Most of the
articles were written by faculty
m<~)mbers.

This issue of Pitt is the birthday
ls:sue———t.he ﬁrst issue having ap-
peared October, l939. Edited by
Mrs. Agnes L. Starrett, assistant
professor of English, Pitt is pub-
lished quarterly. in January, April,
June, and October.

 night, a Privilege,
And. Especially a Duty

According to the sociologists, each person 1n this
world can, must play a number of roles.

,The same man, they say, may be a father and a
son, a Shriner and an Elk, a citizen of the commu-
nity, state, and country.

By the same token, a boy or a girl may be a stu-
dent at’ Pitt and, in addition to varlousother roles,
an advocate of one of the major political partles.

There has been some questions as to whether the
Pitt News should comment on non-student affairs
and events. It has been claimed that ours is a stu-
dent‘ newspaper and that, as such, ltshould restrict
its pages to reporting and discussion ‘of campus
affairs- . v -

It -has been our editorial policy, in the past,_ to
give a preponderance of space to those things which
have most affected the student. That is our Job.
In the main, these things have consisted of such
affairs as dances, sports events, assemblies, and fac-
ulty releases.

This has been so, not because of censorship re-
strictions or lack of other material, but because
campus news has been the most signiﬁcant news.

Following the same line of thought, it is our
intention that whenever other types of news be-
come more signiﬁcant we shall give to them the
preponderance of space.

Signiﬁcant to us in these times are the con-
scription bill, the international situation, the presi-
dential campaign. They rate above next Satur-
day ’s football game and fraternity rushing.

Today, the student plays a new role. As a res-
ident on this sphere, he is affected by that which
affects the nation and the world. More speciﬁcally.
he is affected by the provisions of the National
Youth administration, by the exemption clauses in
the conscription bill.

VVe hold it to be our right, our privilege, above
all, our duty to report on these problems. As usual,
we shall hold to our ideal of the two-way bias.

But the War Still Goes On . . .
1- . . . The cause for which these gallant men
fought still persists. Britain, with unrelenting tenacity
and courage, strikes back at her "foe. Her people,
weary and shell-shocked, living like rats in darkened
cellars‘ and dampened shelters, carry on the battle of
France. They must win if the continent is to be un-
chained from bondage. Every weapon these gallant
British use against the Nazis. must be strengthened.
The civilized world must contribute everything pos-
sible to augment Britain’s effort to destroy the enemy.

Brit-ain’s great, if not her mightiest, weapon against
Hitler is the blockade. To weaken the blockade is to
strengthen Hitler. Who, I ask, will accept the accursed
oath of Hitler, even if he promises not to conﬁscate for
his own use our charitable bounties of food? Already
he has robbed Norway, Denmark, Poland, France, and
He has given
them worthless paper marks in exchange, and on these
they are left to feed.

We must not give food to the people of Europe.

This Is W/ar. Human Beings . . .

A . must die. They must face hunger and star-
vation. They must move to underground abodes, and

these diabolic terrors with a dauntless and unbreakable
spirit-—knowing that freedom and justice are at the
end of the road.

A Democrat

The past seven years have wit-
nessed some of the greatest steps
ever taken to make democracy
work. Remember that democracy
means not only government of and

by thevpeopl-e,’ but it also means
government for all of the people.
Admittedly, the New ~Deal has
constantly fought for the underdog
in our society with legislation such
as the National Labor Relations Act,
the Social Security Act‘, the Wages
and I'I0.Ll1‘:S Act, andthe Works Pro-
gress Administration. But often
overlooked by our Republican
friends are such things as the con-
tlnuance of the Reconstruction
Finance Corporation with its" liber-
al loans to business; the Bankruptcy
Act which allows orderly reorgani-
zation ofpdefun-c,t' businesses; the Se-
curities Exchange Act, which en-
hances business’ reputation by out-
lawing wildcat securities." Thus, we
see that the New Deal has not over-
looked the principle of government
for all of the people, L .

Long, long ago in 1932 and_1933,_
our very economic structure was
shaken. Rebellion wasn’t threaten-
ing—it was here! Farmer after
farmer refused to meet his mort-
gages. Many newspaper accounts
are given concerning the threatened
hanging of law officers who tried to
foreclose mortgages. Ill-fed thou-
sands in the cities were rioting for
the very necessities oflife. Today,
we haven’t completely solved these
problems, but such great strides
have been taken in the direction of
their solution that the New Deal
has ample grounds for asking to be
returned to oflice.

And what have the Republicans
to offer? First, I think it is signiﬁ-
cant that they couldn’t take a chance
on nominating anyone who had
been a Republican for more than a
year or so. Next, I feel it is strik-
ing that “Wendy” (pronounced
“windy”) Willkie rarely mentions
the Republican platform.

Finally, the GOP nominee for
Vice President, the potential go-
between from the executive to the
legislative, a man whose record
shows that he wouldn’t “go-b«e-
tween” if he got the “go” sign from
a man like Willkie! All of which
means that the “Champ” will still
be a “Champ” in December!

A Republican

For a long time I. have been an
avid follower of the pithy wisdoms
expounded by the good Senator Zis-
kind in his weekly columns, but
alas, we have come to the parting
of the ways and I take up my pen
to enter the Political Arena as a
second to the worthy Mr. Kalwary.

‘There are three points which I
would make—-all’ I confess--as the
Senator accuses-anti-FDR rather
than pro-Willkie,’ but since our
R'epublican’”ca'ndi'date ‘has had" no

Roosevelt lollowers who ‘say ' smil-
ins. “I  ,, you have hea‘rd'the" old
proverb‘ afbout"changing' horses ‘in

My second point deals with that
li.tt1e matter precedent . . I be-
lieve that there are certain tradi-
tions which are essentially Amer-
ican. Senator Ziskind describes Mr.
Roosevelt as “a tremendous histor-
ical ﬁgure taking first rank among
all the world’s leaders.” I ask, “Is
Mr. Roosevelt a better man, leader,
or president than General Wash-
ington?” fWhile I can early visual-
ize President __Roosevelt getting off

while on a ﬁshing trip in the Carrib-

The Pitt News

For the beneﬁt of those who were completely mystiﬁed by
.\liss-ourils final kickoﬁ last Saturday, it might be well to explain
the play. Like a great many plays which happen only occasionally,
the incident.Saturda_v was well over the heads of most fans who
have but a casual acquaintance with the rules.

According to the rules, on a kickoff the ball becomes free
property after it travels ten yards. ‘In other words once the ball
passed the 50 yard line, any man on either team was eligible to

Victorious Panthers Seek Wi.n

Over Title-Hungry Mustangs

Charles Bowser and his boys get no let-up this grid season, for, after
facing the Big Ten and Big Six defending champions, in their ﬁrst two
encounters, they battle Southern Methodist, last year’s runnerup in the
Southwest Conference and co-favorite with Texas A. & M. for the 1940

title.

With the best all-around squad
since their great season of 1935, the
Mustangs are hot after the confer-
once toga ﬁrst, but would like noth-
ing better for second choice than
to put Pitt on their list of intersec-
tional victims. Of course, the Tex-
ans also have a little score to settle
with the locals; most of the pres-
ent squad were sophomore starters
on the 1938 squad that had the mis-
fortune to grapple with the Suther-
land Scythe at its zenith and car-
ried the memory of a 34-7 lacing
back to Dallas.

With the most popular collegiate
band West of the Mississippi, the
Methodists present a dazzling grid-
iron show. The galloping Mustangs
toss the pigskin around with reck-
less abandon, play ﬁve-man lines
at the most surprising moments, and
according to all pre-season dope
they are not one mite -cooler than
their red-hot swing band.

To date this campaign, Matty
Bells squad has edged the highly-
touted UCLA outﬁt 9-6 and trim-
med North Texas Teachers, an in-
stitution of great reputation on the
cinder track, 20-7. In the latter
battle, the first string backﬁeld
pounded out but three ﬁrst downs,
the sophomore replacements doing
the scoring. V

However the Mustangs are not
supposed to be limited to two back-
ﬁelds; they have a third. This pha-
lanx of swiVe11hipp’ed“runn‘ers,‘edu-
cated kickers, and sure-shot passers
represents a most versatile back-
ﬁeld.

Advance notices singled out Pres-
ton Johnston, sensational sophomore
kicker, to blaze trails through ene-
my backﬁelds, but to date some of
his less publicized cohorts have
provided copy for Texas sports
writers. Ray Mallouf, senior triple-
threat star, spearheads the Metho-
dists’ offensive.

A stronger all-around lineup than
Missouri takes the ﬁeld against the
Bowser coached eleven Saturday,
and another aerial barrage awaits
the Panther secondary. On the last
northern visit of the Mustangs, the
Dream backﬁeld beat them at their
own game———short, flat passes. This
year, who knows what the Panthers
will do‘? In both of their first two
battles, they were scheduled to un-
veil :1 passing attack.

EDGAR J ONES—After a brilliant
high schqol record and a ﬁne fresh-
man showing,»Jones ran into hard
luck last year. He
w a s picked by
Francis Wallace as
the. sophomore star
of 1939, then suf-
fered an ankle in-
jury that kept him
on the bench half
the season. When
he ﬁnally got back
in harness, his
passing was satis-
factory but his
running was a dis-
appointment.

A g a i n s t Ohio

State he showed
little, being piled up on running
plays and rushed off his feet while
passing, but against Missouri he
was a powerhouse. Forgetting his
passing game completely, he dashed
105 yards in 17 tries, "better than six
yards a crack, scored one Pitt touch-
down, and carried over an extra
point when Sekela’s kick was
blocked.

 

Birea-king: alli precedentfrom pre-
vious years, engineering students
have the. honor of staging the open-
irng touch-football match of the 1940
season tomrrow at 4 o'clock.

The biggest factor in the change
of the annual custom of having the
fraternities do the lid-lifting was
the overlapping of rushing season
with the scheduling of games. As a
result of this, Director Potts has de-
cided to postpone fraternity play
until Monday, October 14.

Top favorites for the crown of
1-}? Champion will be Phi Kappa,
Phi Delta Theta, andtPhi Epsilon
Pi. In the dark horse category Pi
Kappa Alpha, Phi Gamma Delta,
and Delta Tau Delta fill the bill
perfectly. Pi Lambda Phi will have
to depend solely on speedster Larry
Katz, as his “touchdown twin;” Bert
Jaffe received his sheepskin last
June.

In the independent league, the
Punks, 1939 champions of the intra-
mural league, should have little
trouble retaining the crown. Pitt
club, and the Newman- club - are
two of the teams returning again
to try their hand at stopping the
seemingly unbeatable Punk outﬁt.

The engineering league, which
will show many new teams, is
slightly stronger than the circuit of
the previous year. Chemical En-
gineer Juniors, Electrical Engineer
A, Electrical Engineer B, Metallur-
gist Freshman, and Chemical Engi-
neer Sophomores are the new en-
tries.

Seven members of the University of Pittsburgh cross-country team
are expected to make the trip to Lafayette, Ind., on Saturday for the

meet with the Boilermakers from
are expected to rely chieﬂy on the

performance of three veterans and

one newcomer to make the opening

meet a success.

Last season the Blue and Gold
harriers easily defeated the Purdue
squad and pre-meet predictions in-
dicate that the victory will be du-
plicated. With the bulk of last year’s
team returning, and a bumper crop
of reserves on hand, coaches Olsen
and Potts are looking for a ﬁne sea-
son. The Panthers, however, will ..
suffer somewhat this season from
the loss of Lew Manuwal, 1939
sophomore sensation, who has with-
drawn from school.

Reports from the practice sessions
of the harriers indicate that four
men will lead the attack upon the
Boilermakers. These are Zeke
Sterner, Frank McCabe, Mark Al-
lias, and Bob Davis. Sterner and
l\/IcCabe, co-captains, were out-
standing last year, while Allias and
Davis were ireshman stars. The
battle for the number ﬁve position
looms as a close one with three jun-
iors in the thick of the battle.

Ben Foote, Jimmy Saunders, and
John Brosky all are displaying
plenty of ability and should make
the selection diﬁicult for Olsen. The
element of experience will have
practically nothing to with the se-
loction, since all three harriers en-
gaged in the same number of meets
last year.

Following the Purdue contest, the
Pitt squad will leave immediately
for Pittsburgh and point for the
meet with the Cadets of West Point
October 16. Unlike last season
when they were virtually swamped,
the Army team has high hopes of
giving Pitt boys the contest of their
lives. The Panthers will be favor-
ed, however, since many veterans
of last year return.

Dental Students Donate Blood
To Aid in City Hospital Cases

Portrait of a freshman in the
School of Dentistry—his heart in
his work, his mind on his studies,

and his blo0d—-in a test tube!

Organized ‘by Dr. William F.
Swanson, associate professor of bac-
teriology, the dental students have
a student blood donor system under
which a person needing blood im-
mediately for a transfusion can get
the ﬂuid, correctly typed, upon
calling.

The idea of typing students for
immediate blood transfusions, con-
ceived 10 years ago, is the only one
in practice in the world, declares
Dr. Swanson. The services of don-
ors from the School of Dentistry
have been requested hundreds of
times, because in the school, as in
any large gathering of people, it is
inevitable that there is always some-
one present of the needed blood
type.

The dental student is typed. im-
mediately upon entering, and his
type ﬁled so that it takes only a
few minutes to secure the correct
‘type for the transfusion.

Since well over 50 per cent of the
dental students are of the “O” type,
the “Universal donor class,” and

czm. give blood to anyone regardless '

of the patient’s type, many stu-
cie-tits. have been called in the past
10 offer blood. to patients through-

out the Pittsburgh area.

Besides helping the patient by pro-
\ iding a means of speedy location of
needed blood type, students
found selling their blood a
 1. of helping pay their way
