Trustees
approve J
project  

By Marty Willis
The Pitt News

Pitt’s Board of Trustees formally
committed the university to become

a member of the proposed Pitts-»

burgh Nuclear Magnetic Resonance

Institute in a meeting Wednesday.
The trustees, who meet once every

term, passed a resolution authoriz-

3" ing Pitt’s membership by a unani-

r_no_us voice vote. The institute is a
joint venture between Pitt,
Carnegie-Mellon University and 12
area hospitals, six of them affiliated
with Pitt. . 8
‘‘It’s going to give us a tremendous
capability for research and effective
clinical treatment incancer. We will
become one of the leading cancer
centers for this purpose in America,"

, Chancellor Wesley Posvar told the

board after the resolution passed. .
Before reading the resolution,
Nathan .1. Stark, senior vice-

“chancellor for the health sciences, ‘

called nuclear magnetic resonance
“probably one of the most exciting
breakthroughs in medical history.”

“In the future, this capability will
enable our physicians to diagnose a
number of life-threatening diseases
and medical conditions, including
cancer, much earlier than was pre-
viously possible,” Stark explained.’

Stark said the negotiations on the
proposed institute are already in
their final stages. The project will be
divided into two components, basic
research and clinical practice and
research, he said.

The Oxford site near Magee-
Women's Hospital will house the
clinical part of the institute, while
basic research will be conducted at
CMU's Mellon Institute. The hospi-
tals will manage the clinical budget,
and the universities will oversee the
research budget, according to a

statement distributed at the meeting. 1

None of the money for the insti-
tute will come from the operating
budget of the university, Stark said,
explaining that all funds will be from
grants and other sources.

In other business announced by
Posvar.,in his customary report to
the board:

0 The university will not use pub-
lic money to contest the United
Faculty’s campaign for unionization
in upcoming hearings before the
state labor board. “I would like to
reaffirm the policy which we

ilar hearings were held on the issue...

Pitt joins two new  
high-tech projects

$8 million
agreement
announced

Pitt announced Wednesday that
the agreement on an $8 million co-
research project with the Digital
Equipment Corporation —- which
will provide the university with com-
puter hardware in exchange for
research and development» — has
been finalized.

According to Jinx Walton, man-

ager of staff and user communica-
tions in the University Computer

' Center, Pitt will spend $4 million for
computer hardware worth an esti-.
- mated $8 million.

“Essentially, it is a commitment
on our part to buy VAX system
computers in a network mode,
which will be our main computer
resource — heavy computer
resource — in the near future,”
Chancellor Wesley Posvar said at
Wednesday’s meeting of the univer-
sity Board of Trustees. '

Posvar said this represents a “con-
siderable savings to the university.”
He estimated that Pitt will save
“about $20 million, directly or
indirectly." '

The three-year agreement with
DEC will committhe university to
provide assistance in the develop-
ment of both network maintenance
programs and computer-based edu-

. cational programs as well as to pro-

vide DEC with a working site for
demonstration of its equipment;
“This agreement...is a further step
toward our goal of becoming one of
the most - technologically“ advanced
campuses in the nation,” Posvar
said. “This is the first such project
with a major computer company

I utilizing the fiber-optic communcia-

tions system being developed by the
university and AT&T..-.. '

“Over the next, five years, we
expect our campus of the future to
involve -investments of over $40
million.”

Posvar said that the agreement
will provide “convenient computer

7 access to every faculty member and

student who needs it.”

Dr. Paul Stieman, director of the
University Computer Center, said,
however, “We are not anticipating
having a one-to-one ratio of access
devices to students and faculty.”

He gcontrasted Pitt’s long-term
plans with those of Carngie-Mellon
University, which is seeking such a
one-to-one ratio.‘ . V

Pitt‘s current mainframe equip-
ment, mostly DEC system-10’s, now
supports over 15,000 student users
and 5,000 faculty and staff users
per term. The system can handle 450'
users simultaneously.

SGB takes
cut in new
allocation .

By Colette Fenis
The Pitt News

The Student Government Board
has received $47,849 to fund its
activities through February 1985.

Its grant from the Allocations"

Committee was almost $3,000 less
than the $51,080 originally sought.

Last year, the SGB received more
than $54,000 to pay operating and

I programing expenses. This year, for

the first time, the SGB will have to
do more with less.

It will be responsible for tele-.

phone expenses expected to exceed
$10,000. The SGB
to maintain student
organization telephones located on

received ‘

the fifth floor of the William Pitt»

Union. '

The remainder has been allotted
to telephones in the SGB suite.

At its regular weekly meeting yes-
terday, the board unanimously
voted to accept the allocation.

Besides telephone evgenses, the
board also will be payfrtg for the
salaries of a full-time rssti-/...~'etary, and
ﬁve work-study studerzts andjtravel
expenses, in addition to providing
student activities.

While the budget was accepted

almost without comment yesterday,
an emergency request proposal pres-

ented to the board to provide $1,050 ,

for a retirement reception’ was

. debated.

The reception is for Savina S.
Skewis, the founder of many. Pitt
student organizations including stu-
dent government.

The Allocations Committee

recommended denying the request ,

of seven student organizations who
want to honor her on her retirement
after 38 years at Pitt.

“If it weren't for Savina Skewis, , 8

we wouldn't be here,” said board
member David Pikovsky.

The SGB rejected. the committee‘s
recommendation. The proposal will
now be reconsidered by the Alloca-
tions Committee and presented to
the board again next week.

SGB funds, as well as funds for all
student organizations, are taken
from the $24 Student Activity Fee

paid by each Pitt undergraduate

once a year. .

The Allocations Committee
receives 50 percent of Pitt's Student
Activity Fee fund. This year, the
amount is $300,000. The Pitt Pro-
gram Council receives 35 percent of
these funds.

First multiple transplant

Child recovering smoothly

By Tim Hunter
The Pitt News

Stormie Jones, the 6-year-old girl
from Cumby, Texas, is doing well
after undergoing surgery in the first
multiple-organ transplant.

“She is kind of sleepy right now,”
said Kwajalelin Overton, Stormie’s
nurse. “She is off the ventilator and

. breathinglnormally on her own. Her
condition is critical but stable; it’s ‘

usually like that for some time for
ICU patients.”

Last Tuesday, Stormie was the
first person ever to undergo a liver
and heart transplant simultane-

I ously. The 16-hour operation was

performed by two surgery teams
headed by Dr. Henry T. Bahnson,
cardiothoracic surgeon and profes-
sor and chairman of Pitt‘s depart-
ment of surgery, and Dr. Thomas
Starzl, liver transplantation surgeon
and professorlof surgery.

Stormie was suffering ' from
hypercholesterolemia, a rare con-
genital disease that causes an
extraordinarily high buildup of cho-

. lesterol in the blood, according to I

Liver transplantation was neces-
sary for Stormie to maintain 21 nor-

Her heart was too weak to withstand
the liver transplant; she had already

her high cholesterol level, he said.

Former Soviet diplomat:
Chernenko not strong

By Kelly Murray
The Pitt News

The highest rankingsoviet diplo-
mat ever to defect to the West pre-
dicted that new Soviet General
Secretary Konstantin Chernenko
will not be a strong leader during a
lecture at Carnegie-Mellon Univer-
sity on Wednesday.

Arkady Shevchenko, former
Soviet ambassador to the United
Nations and adviser to Foreign Min-
ister Andrei Gromyko, said the
Soviet Union is experiencing “
moment of serious change" in a
speech before approximately 300
students. ‘

Shevchenko visited Pitt this past
Sept. 20, a few weeks after the down-
ingof Korean Airlines Flight 007.

Shevchenko said it was out of
“necessity" that Chernenko suc-
ceeded Yuri And ropov and that he is
not respected by his colleagues. He
said Chernenko’s real strength
comes from being “a professional
member" of the Communist
Politburo.

He described the new leader,
whom he had known personally for
20 years, as “ambitious, dictatorial,
rude and arrogant.” He said Cher-

a .

nesslike but not well-educated.
Commenting on the nuclear arms
buildup, Shevchenko said Soviet
leaders understand that a nuclear
war would mean an end to all human
life, but they also believe “nuclear
weapons are political weapons."
He said Soviet leaders are very
fearful of the United States and
China and see nuclear weapons as
“security against invasions and use-
ful in intimidating other nations."
Without nuclear arms, they fear the
Soviet Union would be “second-
rate" and lose superpower status.
Shevchenko believes the United
States and the Soviet Union are both
“adversaries and partners./”
Although the two countries may be
in historical competition over demo-
cracy and communism, Shevchenko
said bothcountries share concern‘
about nuclear weapons in Third

)

problems. a
While in the Soviet Union, Shev-
chenko was a member of the Com-
munist Party for 30 years but made
his decision to defect to the United
States because of “serious disagree-
ment” with the party and its leaders.
He said his first year of freedom
was the most frightening because he
was briefing U.S. officials on the
Soviet Union, but he no longer fears

Pitt’s theater department. The stu-
dio theater group, funded by the
Student Government Board, has
administrated the facilities for the
past l4 years. \

The theatre arts department
would like to use the small studio
and production facility to hold
drama. classes. It may also become
more involved in the operation of
the student-run theater group. Such
action could change the function of
the entire organization.

_ According to Linda Henry, Stu-i ’

dio Theatre publicity manager,
“Some members are afraid they
won’t be cast in productions or given
the opportunity to direct.”

Presently, students run all ele-'
ments of production in the Studio
Theatre.

Studio Theatre president Donna
Saul said, “We look at it in terms of
the experience of people working in
the shows. We could continue to
function as an organization as we

have in the past, with more space. ,

The department’s involvement is

more or less to save the department

as they see it.

“As the department grows, the
need for space also grows. At times,
as many as l8 graduate and under-
graduate showswill need places to
rehearse. We have just this small
area."

Presently, the theater space pro-
vides an opportunity for both under-
graduates and graduates, though
undergrads have top priority.

Weekly meetings between faculty
and students are expected to con-
tinue until a satisfactory proposal is
formulated.

Conflicting Story

The water’s rising, the rats are jumping ship and U.S. bombs
are still falling on Lebanon.

Lebanon’s army is in ruin, and President Gemayel has lost all
but symbolic control over a nation that hasn't had peace in
more than 15 years. And the Reagan administration continues
to wage war without any perceptable goal.

Initially, President Reagan said the U.S. forces were sta- ,

tioned as peace-keeping forces. They weren’t supposed to take
sides, just stop the fighting and killing of innocent civilians. But
when we began firing solely upon anti-government forces,
shelling surrounding villages in the process, we forever changed
the U.S.’s role in the region.

Our Marines are currently surrounded by forces, and we are
making those forces increasingly hostile by firing shells at them
that weigh as much as automobiles.

Reagan continues to claim he’s actingwith neutrality, but he
seems to be having a hard time convincing or reminding even
his top and most trusted aides.

Last week, high-level administration officials said the shel-
ling was not aimed at supporting the multi-national forces but,
rather, were ordered to shore up the faltering Lebanese govern-
ment. Denials were quickly issued by White House spokesman
Larry Speakes. .

F The contradictions coming out of Washington exploded
Tuesday when Secretary of the Navy John Lehman Jr. said,
“There very definitely has been a shift in emphasis to make it
clear that we will be providing supporting fire to the Lebanese
armed forces.” « I ’

This, too,‘was followed by a White House denial.

If senior White House advisers and the heads of our armed
forces don’t know what we’re doing in Lebanon, who does? Our
involvement in Lebanon has escalated tremendously in the past
week, including last Wednesday’s nine-hour bombing — the
largest American shore bombardment since Vietnam.

Americans must recognize that we will be accountable for

* these actions which the president is committing in our name.

The cop_tinued and unexplained belligerency toward Lebanon

must end if we are going to establish any credibility with the V

opposition forces, who quite possibly may be the next leaders

in Lebanon.

  Letters to the Editor

College life
a last refuge

This generation of Americans isa
unique one. Raised under the spec-
tre of nuclear destruction and great
social upheaval, it appears rather
complacent. The great concerns
emanating from the university are
nothing more than making a buck
and getting a job. People pass
through four years hardly realizing

-» the unique opportunity that this

environment presents.

College is the time and place to
mature and grow, but it is also the
last time and place to let your hair
down in a fashion where no one will
raise an eyebrow. People can screw
up between 18 and 23 and still get
away with it. Or at least this is the
way it is supposed to be. Further,
this time is during which the intellec-
tual fodder is drawn from which
career decisions come‘.

Upon leaving this arena, a career
focuses more narrowly one's intel-
lectual horizons. All that is learned,
experienced and thought out from
the university era is the basis for
these future decisions. For this very
reason, now is the most precious of
times. Someone once asked, “Does
it get better than this?" Yes, it does

get better than now. But no time
may be more important.
It is for this reason, WALDEN, as

an idea, was established. An oppor- '

tunity to go beyond classroom
teaching and build the capital that
will be expended throughout the rest
of a career.

The generation before us tried
such a bold experiment. The_success
was limited,.but it was there. Some

people now in leadership positions ,

are presenting new ideas, but stil
more needs to be done. ~ '
A movie asked, “Does all this
really matter?” Let us hope so; oth-
erwise, we will all resort to the old
practices, and the ideals of youth
will vanish. The older generation
tells us this is only natural; thoughts
of the youth cannot work. Don’t
believe this. It is on the premise that
the ideas do work that WALDEN is
based. I

Legal immunity just across. the hollow’

As the pressure of being a grad
student, a bellhop, a fiance and an
assistant auditor for a tiny suburban
borough mounted up on this once-
in-a-while columnist, I quickly real-
ized it would take an act of God to
provide me with something so juicy
that I absolutely had to find time to
write about it. Darn if God didn’t
strike, just across the hollow at
Carnegie-Mellon.

Maybe I’m alone in this belief, but
I think perhaps not. I was always
under the impression that despite
the fact that CMU has funny names
for some of its courses and pro-
grams, it was populated by a group
of students a cut above most others.
Even after the incident last fall,
when a student nearly died from an
overdose of alcohol at a CMU fra-
ternity party, I rationalized that
every classy institution has a not-so-
classy moment or two.

The facts, as I understand them,
are as follows: a student senator at
CMU, a fellow by the unlikely name
of Orpheus Allison, called in the
Liquor Control Board to break up a
party that was being thrown last Fri-

day by CMU‘s Student Senate.
Seems that the senate was selling
beer at a quarter a glass without a
license to do so. Four senators were
arrested by the LCB agents. The
senate responded by voting last
Tuesday night to impeach Allison. It
reproached him for being a fink and
deemed him unfit for further senate
service.

Unbelievable. Once again, we are
all shown that truth is, indeed,
stranger than fiction.

It is a shame that Allison didn't
bring his intentions to the CMU
senate sooner. He states that he
didn’t realize that selling beer with-
out a license in this state was illegal
until the day before the party.
Maybe he had midterms to study for
Thursday night, or maybe he had a
hot date that night or was otherwise
too preoccupied to pick up his
phone, call a fellow senator and let
him or her know that he would
report the senate to the authorities
should it sell beer the following day.
In any case, he failed to do this and
failed to stop this mess from ever
happening.

The spotlight now shifts to the
CMU senate, which evidently con-
sists of 28 or so students who are
ignorant of the fact that one does not
legally sell beer in Pennsylvania
without a license. This sort of defies
imagination, but let‘s assume, for
the sake of argument, that this was
actually the case. As the little old
lady at the burger stand says,
where's the beef?

Ignorance excuses no one in this
land from the rules of the game. If
the CMU senate breaks a law and
gets caught, you would think that its
anger might be directed inward and
that its members would waste time
kicking themselves in the seat of
their collective pants for not know-
ing the law.

Or, ifthey knew on Thursday that
selling beer on Friday was illegal and
sold beer anyway, perhaps they
would act as one might expect a
responsible group of students to act
by admitting their guilt, accepting
their punishment and promising to
be smarter next time.

Instead, they _censure the only
member of their group with any evi-

dent appreciation for the law of the
land and kick him. Out of their
group, that is. To me, this a rather
strange reaction.

But wait, gentle reader, for this
story contains still another unex-
pected twist. The dean of student
affairs at CMU, Braden Walter,
went on record as supporting the
senate‘s decision to impeach Allison.
He stated that the university handles
its own problems, criticized the LCB
for not calling before it visited on
Friday and implied that the problem
was not that a group of CMU stu-
dents was breaking the law but that
one CMU student had the temerity
to report the lawbreakers.

Now, pardon me if I misunder-
stand all this, but I take this as mean-
ing, basically, that CMU does not
have to obey state laws due to the
fact that it is CMU and takes care of
its own problems. lfthis is true, and
if universities are above the law, then
I would like to know where I can
sign up. How I can start my own
university and do all those fun things
I'd like to do but can‘t because they
are illegal?

As the case stands at the moment,
the four CMU students arrested on
Friday might end up with criminal
records. This would be tragic, since
they haven’t committed such an evil
offense that they deserve to be
branded for life as convicted crim-
inals. Orpheus Allison committed
no crime; indeed, he upheld the law
through reporting his fellovf
students. A

However, it certainly seems that
he failed the rest of the senate by
springing his surpriseon them with-
out advance notice. The senate, in
return, served notice that it has no
respect for people who respect the
law by impeaching Allison. Sanc-
tioning the senate’s action is Dean
Walter, who implies that a fellow
selling beer on the corner of Forbes
and Morewood is different from a
senator selling beer inside Skil.<;"
Hall since the senator is part of
CMU and therefore needs no
license.

All this makes me certain of only
one thing: I am happy that I am on
this side of the hollow.

View From Abroad/ Ann Leopold I

“Did you feel safe?"“Weren’t you
scared about being in a country
always at war?" Those questions, as
well as many others, confronted me
when I returned from six months of
study at Tel Aviv University in
Israel. Considering Israel has expe-
rienced five wars during almost 3.6
years of existence, these questions
didn’t surprise me. However, they
demonstrated -just how little people
know about this tiny country, which
is, in so many ways, very similar to
our own but, in even more ways,
very different. *

First of all, to answer the initial
question, no I wasn’t nervous about
living in Israel. On the contrary, I
felt safer the entire time I was in
Israel than I ever have in the four
years I’ve lived in Oakland. Tel
Aviv, where I studied, is a metropol-
itan city ofabout one million people..
Although it could be compared to
New York, Philadelphia or Chicago,
it doesn’t have the crime rate to
match.

We could walk outside at night
and could tramp (hitchhike) any-
where in the country without fearing
that we’d be raped, mugged or
killed. In many parts of the country,
civilians possess guns for security
reasons. However, crimes using
guns do not prevail; gun control is
not an issue.

BIRTHRIGHT

Studying at the university pre-
sented me with the opportunity to
really get to know students. "To look
at them, one would think they are
just like us. They dress like us, listen
to Michael Jackson, go to clubs and

A love “Fame” and “Dallas.” But there

the similarities end.

Israelis don’t attend university
until they complete their three-year
mandatory army service at age 21.
Students are older and more serious.
Many work and even support fami-
lies. Because their course loads are
heavier than ours and their studies
can be interrupted due to a call to
their reserve unit for up to one
month, the time they spend studying
is concentrated. Libraries at Tel
Aviv University closed at 9 p.m.,
forcing students to study in their
rooms. Israelis did not appreciate
when Americans on my program
would hold loud dorm parties,
something to which we are
accustomed.

Cafes around campus were very
popular. Students socialized over
coffee between classes, after classes
and in the evening. While we may go
to Peter’s or the Keg with a friend for
a beer, Israelis meet for coffee at
cafes or at one another’s apartments,
an atmosphere I found much more
conducive to heart-to-heart conver-
sation. Although Israelis will drink
alcohol, they seldom drink to the

   
  

4

point of intoxication.

Students, reflecting the popula-
tion in general, are more politically
aware and active. Israelis wake up to
the news and listen to it before going
to bed. Silence overtakes public
buses when passengers hear the
beeps signifying the start of the
news. Whereas we elect our Student
Government Board because of indi-
vidual platforms, cnadidates for stu-
dent government in Israel represent
the various political parties and
reflect the political mood of the stu-
dent population. Everyone has a
political opinion and is more than
anxious to share it.

Campus activities are yet another
facet of student life that differed
from ours. Pitt has over 100 student
organizations, a beautiful student
union and many programs, but little
participation. At Tel Aviv Univer-
sity, the TV and recreation rooms
and the club with music and live
bands in the basement of our dormi-
tory buildings were always packed.

Israelis on a whole seemed quite
hospitable. Strangers would invite
us for coffee or to spend a Shabbat,
the Sabbath. My roommates and I
had wanted to visit Be’er Sheva in
the south to see the colorful Bedoin

Marked. We ended up staying with
the family of someone who had
picked us up one night while we were
hitchhiking in Tel Aviv and with
whom we had become friends.

Every piece of land and every

stone in Israel has either a religious-

or historical significance. On Satur-
days, the only non-workday, fami-
lies flock to the parks. Parents instill
in their children while they’re young
a pride for their land. Soldiers dur-
ing their training learn about their
land through their feet.

Lastly, the observances by Israelis
of two holidays made a tremendous
impact on me. Yom Hazikaron,
Memorial Day, is much more signif-
icant in the lives of Israelis than is
our holiday to us. Every family has
suffered losses. Both at night and in
the morning, a two-minute siren is
sounded throughout the’ country;
everything comes to a standstill. I
was on a public inter-city bus during

one of the periods. The traffic-

stopped. Everyone stood. Some
people got out of their cars and
saluted.

‘As sad as this day was, thenext
day, Independence Day, was as

An American’s lessons from Israel

intensely joyous. This day cele-
brated the continued existence of the
state for which all of those who had
just been memorialized=had fought.
The emotions of the two days con-
trasted with one another. Both dem-
onstrated Israelis’solidarity through
good and through bad and the
recognition that although memor-
ializing the past is important, so is
celebrating the present and the
future.

Two years ago, I sat as a student
representative on the committee that
reformedrthe CAS curriculum. At
that time, we debated the import-

nace of a foreign culture and Ian- ~

guage requirement. It's a shame,
though, that a requirement to study
abroad couldn’t have been a practi-
cal consideration. »

Studying in Israel, I learned not
only about Israelis and -Israel, but I
also learned more about myself and
this country. Insulated in this coun-
try, we tend to think that the entire
world perceives actions as we would.
When we step away from the culture
and lives to which we are accus-
tomed, we can better understand
who we really are.

US. Steel Building for Sale

The owners of the U.S. Steel Building in downtown Pittsburgh are
planning to sell the building for $327 million, reports said yesterday.
According to The Pittsburgh Press, the owners of the building — the
California State Public Employees Pension Fund and the State
Teachers’ Retirement Board of Ohio — plan to sell the building to an
unidentified syndication group. The 64-story building cost the two
groups about $248 million in l982.

Miners burn in methane explosion

Officials said yesterday that three miners are missing and four were

severly burned in a methane gas explosion and fire at a coal mine near  E    

Cookport, Indiana County. The injured miners are listed in guarded  ..
condition at Miners Hospital in Springler, with first- and second- '    M

degree burns of the face and hands.

The-U.S. Bureau of Mines said that the explosion occurred in two
sections of the mine, in which 412 people work underground and I4
work above the ground. "

It is estimated that 2.25 million cubic feet of methane gas is handled
and evacuated from the mine every 24 hours.

Dying as
a favor to

your friends  

By Nancy Popkin
The Pitt News

Honey is considered a healthy
woman by her doctor, but she thinks
she is dying. ,

She had a cancerous tumor
removed from her breast two years
ago. Somehow, critical complica-
tions not caused by her illness arose
following her surgery.

Her physician, Dr. Eric Cassell,
an internist at the Cornell University
of Medicine, presented yloney as an
example of someone whom he
believes is “dying for her friends.”

Cassell explained the effect that
society has on people with illnesses
at a lecture Wednesday entitled
“Dying as a Favor to Your Friends.”
The lecture was presented to first-
year Pitt medical students who are
studying patient care.

Cassell described Honey as cheer-
ful and smiling before she under-
went the mastectomy opertaion. He
ioted that that was unusual for a
woman about to have her breast
removed and that Honey was behav-
ing as she thought she should.

That sense of role-playing by the
patient continued following the
surgery, when Honey believed she
should behave as a woman with

-breast cancer — a woman about to

die.

Cassell does not consider Honey’s
case unusual and said that friends
often make the sick friend the dying
friend. He said that illness and medi-
cine has become the stuff of cocktail
party talk, where friends often dis-
cuss each other’s symptoms and the
sideeffects of medication.

“They just want you to die for
them," Cassell said of friends. “Let
them find someone else to die for
them; they will, you know.“

Another mastectomy patient of
Cassell‘s suffered radical hair loss
from chemotherapy treatments.
This woman had a more difficult
time in dealing with the hair loss
than with the breast surgery.

Her hair loss was a sign to her
family and friends that she suffered
from cancer, she told Cassell.

Cassell counsels patients to limit
their discussion of the treatment or
illness with friends and to confront
those people who expect certain

NASA astronaut calls for

By Karen Dobrzynski
The Pitt News

“Space is a wonderful labora-
tory. Man is shaped and used by
gravity, and by removing this, we
can study the effects it has on
living systems and really begin to
understand the body,” said Wil-
liam Edgar Thornton, M.D., one
of the few physicians ever to be

launched into space. His latest

flight was the third flight of the

Space Shuttle Challenger’ in

August, 1983. .
Thornton discussed the future

' of medical research in space dur-

ing a brief press conference yes-
terday. He was present to deliver
the Aaron Brown. Educational
Foundation lecture, sponsored
by Pitt’s medical fraternity.

He commented on the future
beyond the space stations and
the possibilities of maintaining a
space station by the end of this

- decade as outlined by President.

Ronald Reagan. “We have the
technology to accomplish [this];
it now dependsion how we han-
dle our affairs on earth.”

Space research is critical, he
said. “With the elimination of

gravity, the separation of cells

and other biological medium is

Karl Kobil/The Pitt News

so efficient. These things can be
done 10-100 times as fast‘ when
there’s no gravity to interfere.”-
Thornton is scheduled to go
back up into space in November
of this year and will be in charge
of a large animal payload. Hope-
fully, within one or two years, he
said, animals will be used in
actual research in space.’
Thornton has an ‘extensive
background in space research.

Vomiting is a typical charac-
ter_istic of space flight,’ he
‘explained. Originally, it was.
compared to the motion sickness
experienced by many people on

earth. However, he said, the

vomiting reflex characteristic of
seasickness and the like is accom-
panied by waves of nausea, but in

THE ROLLING STONES A TO Z
By Sue Weiner and Lisa Howard
Grove Press

There are more than enough books
written about The Rolling Stones
without this one to add injury to the
list. Face it, until Mick or Keith writes
his autobiography, all the rest of this
stuff is tired bullshit. So for all you
budding journalists who think you've
got something to add to the legend
known as The Rolling Stones — and
that includes you, Sue Weiner and
Lisa Howard —— a word of advice:
SHADDUP ALREADY! We've heard
it all before, we're falling asleep, we
don't care and we want you to sell
your sordid little typewriters and
personal" computers and get real jobs!

For the record, though, The Rolling
Stones A to Z is a compilation that reads
much like a dictionary about the
Stones’ lives. There are over 3,000
listings in alphabetical order; every-
thing from song titles (released and
unreleased) to.. the names of girl-
friends and acquaintances is located
between its bindings.

If you're a Stones fanatic, 99.9 per-
cent of this stuff is old news, seen and
heard elsewhere and chronicled in
more interesting fashion by other
authors. I did learn, however, that
David Bowie sings back-up vocals on
"It's Only Rock and Roll" —- an inter—
esting fact, but nothing to make you
shiver and shake with excitement.

The most interesting. list comes
near the book's very beginning under
”arrests.” Various Stones (but mostly
Keef) have been busted in such far-
reaching geographical locations as
Liverpool, Barcelona, Rome, Nice

MY LAST SIGH
By Luis Bunuel
Alfred A. Knopf

In his essay, ”About William Beck-
ford’s Vathek,” Jorge Luis Borges says
that the true biography of a human
would have to be infinite, every
instant of life recorded; that all biog-
raphies (or autobiographies) must
content themselves with a drastic
paring of the events of their subjects’
lives. Since one reduced series of
events is no better than any other, it
would be possible to write a bio-
graphy of Michelangelo which makes
no mention of a single work of sculp-
ture or painting. A biography which
claims to relate the ”most important"
events in the life of its subject simply
attempts to pass off a scattered, ran-
dom, subjective selection as a seam-
less objective record.

The late director Luis Bunuel,
however, was never interested in
objectivity, and My Last Sigh, his
highly idiosyncratic autobiography,
presents us with all sorts of uncon-
nected anecdotes and digressions,
selected not chiefly because of their
”importance," but only because they
came to mind as Bunuel discussed his
life with his friend and recorder,
Jean-Claude Carriere. My Last Sigh is
not the story of Bunuel’s life, but a
selection from the detailed footnotes
to that infinite story which can never
be written.

One begins to suspect that the
autobiography will be unconven-
tional in the first chapter, "Memory."
Bunuel discusses his elderly mother's
amnesia, tells a few memory jokes

(Arkansas), - Toronto

Mick and KeefIThe Glimer Twins

Airport (France), Jamaica, Fordyce
and St.
Maarten, just to name a few. The’
Stones have led interesting lives to be

and then describes his own bad
memory, admitting that in the course
of talking about his life, he may have
described certain events he
remembers quite well but which
never actually happened. Thus
warned, one begins the second chap-
ter in, the year 1900, when Bunuel
was born to an upper-middle class
family of the Aragon region of Spain.
My Last Sigh follows a roughly 1
chronological sequence: Bunuel’s
early childhood in the small town of
Caland; his youth in Saragossa,
where Bunuel was taught by the
Jesuits, lost his virginity and saw both
his first airplane and his first movie;
his university days in Madrid with,
among others, Dali and Garcia Lorca;
his initiation and acceptance into the
ranks of _the Surrealists in Paris; the
making of his first outrageous movie,
An Andalusian Dog; Bunuel’s involve-
ment in the Spanish Civil War and his
exile from Spain; his later life as a
filmmaker in Mexico; and a very
affecting record of his last years, lived
in patient anticipation of death.
These are all the things one would
expect from a standard record of Luis
Bunuel, and yet Bunuel devotes only
half his book to these "official” parts
of his life. One whole chapter of the
book, ”Earthly Pleasures,” is devoted
to his experience with alcohol,
cigarettes and sex, in which Bunuel
reveals his recipe for the perfect dry
martini (allow a ray of sunlight to
pierce a drop of Vermouth before it
hits the gin) and recalls the bars and
whores who brightened his life; in
another chapter, Bunuel discusses
only his recurring dreams and fanta-

sure —- the arrests and girlfriends are

all mind—boggling -— but you won't

find much evidence of that here.
LESLIE VAN BUSKIRK

sies; two other chapters are titled
”Love and Love Affairs” and "Still an
Atheist...Thank God!”

These broad, funny, very personal
essays occur at random throughout
the book, in no particular sequence.
Jeanne, Bunuel’s wife of 49 years,
receives less mention than does the
city of Toledo, Spain, in which
Bunuel never lived but loved dearly.
We also learn very little of his child-
ren —— they were perhaps less present
in his memory than a certain woman
he met once during his hilariously
idle visit to Hollywood in 1930.

‘ Not surprisingly, much of what
Bunuel chose to remember for his
autobiography pertains to his films -
not so much the details of shooting,
gossip about actors and actresses or
theoretical discussion of his goals as a
filmmaker, though these are found
throughout the book —— but rather,
the small things he saw or heard dur-
ing his life: primitive Spanish drums,
old Catholic gestures or the mistreat-
ment of a dog, which he could never
forget, and which found their way
into his movies again and again.

A rambling, anecdotal, subjective,
opinionated autobiography could be
dreadfully boring, unreadable. My
Last Sigh is fascinating; rather than
reading it, one almost hears Bunuel
speaking; slowly, humorously, no
more modestly than is necessary, all
the time uncertain whether ulti-
mately to view his life with satisfac-
tion or with terrible sadness.

THE FURTHER ADVENTURES OF
HUCKLEBERRY FINN

By Greg Matthews

Crown

Mark Twain created an endearing
and durable hero with The Adventures
of Huckleberry Finn. With wit and style,
Twain chronicled the progress of
Huck and Jim, a runaway slave, on a

raft trip down the Mississippi River. .

At the end of his story, Huck con-
fesses that book writing is difficult
and vows never to do another.

But Greg Matthews, an Australian
writer, has seen fit to label his first
novel as the sequel: The Further Adven-
tures of Huckleberry Finn. While his cour-
age _or egomania or commendable
choice of literary hero may be
admired, his book registers as almost
complete failure, remarkably ill-
conceived and" poorly executed.
"There was another book I writ
before this one which give the story
about how me and Jim went down the
river on a raft,” states Matthew's
Huck Finn in the first paragraph,
provoking dismay. The author relies
too heavily on. Twain's detail and
character nuance to flesh out the new
novel.

Further Adventures lacks the inno-

A cence of Twain; those familiar with

his characters ought to be aghast at
the fates Matthews has pencilled in.
Widow Douglas, Huck’s guardian,
meets death in a house fire. Tom
Sawyer and Becky Thatcher aim at

marriage; Judge Thatcher is found ,_

dead — his head nearly severed and
the blame going to Huck. And Mat-
thews resurrects Pap Finn with the
news that his death in the other novel
had been mistaken. Worse, the
author draws Pap (one of Twain's
most despicable characters) as sorrily
sympathetic before killing him again.

Along with Jim, recently freed,
Huck heads to California and the gold
rush, a trip not unlike the Mississippi
raft ride. The new Huck meets prosti-
tutes referred to as "whores," various

thieves, rascals, detectives and an odd»

sexual deviant or two. En route —— to
save himself -— Huck spins complex
and convoluted webs of lies to cover
his tracks. Astonishingly (even
Twain would be impressed), he. never
trips himself up. Matthews’ charac-
ters speak with decidedly non-
Twainian frankness and vulgarity. .

.The episodic construction of the
novel seems nearly arbitrary. Mat-
thews might have stopped at any
point, since his last chapter is a catch-
all, conveniently exonerating Huck
and preparing him for another jaunt
with Jim.

Twain's novel was dated in terms
of literary style and subjectlmatter,
the treatment of blacks in particular.
Viewed in historical context, how-
ever, Adventures withstands the scrut-
iny. The same cannot be said of
Matthews’, which has no roots in the
past. Written in 1983, the sentiments
— "nigger" and "injun” — are merely

offensive. As a slight concession to A

modern times, Huck reflects upon
the injustice done to free blacks by
whites. Obliged to take on the dis-
guise of an Indian boy, Huck learns a
moral lesson of sorts. Experiencing
the prejudice directed at non-whites,
he gains insight into Jim's feelings.
”Time and change will make a man
different no matter how hard he tries
to hold back,” comments Huck.
Matthews’ decision to retain the
misspellings and grammar peculiari-
ties of Huck Finn's storytelling limits
the proceedings as well. The painfully

Woody's Neu-Roses

By FRANK DIGIACOMO

Woody Allen has found "his way
back on to the critics’ pedestal of ado-
ration. He must have, for Broadway

. Danny Rose, his second film inless than
' a ‘year, has been grossly overrated
with heapings of their clever praise.

Albeit, Danny Rose is a good film, but
it is not the masterpiece that journal-
istic circles claim it to be. The charac-
ters are some of Allen's most
fascinating, but they are forced to
exist in a thin plot riddled with tired
neurotic humor. ‘

Allen has scripted Rose as a carica-
ture, and he plays him the same way
-with exaggerated gestures and a war-
drobe of cheap polyester separates.
The role fits him like a fingerless

~. glove and once again bares the lova-
ble neurotic-loser persona that have
occupied the majority of his films.

Rose is a two-bit New York talent
agent who manages a mangy roster
of acts (all of whom, by the way, have
been guests on The David Letterman
Show). However, he doesn't just
book his clients into clubs; he molly-

' coddles the clients with the fervor
and sacrifice of a Jewish mother.
Danny Rose is a nice guy —- too nice,
in fact, to be a talent agent, and once
his acts make it, they leave him.

By now, though, Allen's hard-luck
schtick wears thin. While Rose's
characterization turns out to be a

perfect vehicle for his Chaplinesque -

humor and Semitic guilt trips, the
brand of wit is already too familiar.
.It's like putting ketchup in a_ steak
sauce bottle: it'll flavor the meat, but
the customer will still know it's
ketchup. _ '

Nevertheless, Allen's character
evokes laughs with his usual arsenal
of one-liners and zingers; his only
defense against the people who walk

.all over him. Rose's dialogue often

consists of the same cliche-ridden
fast-talk that, the movie shows,
fueled his career as a_ half-baked
standup comedian and gives him the
sad appearance ofbeing outdated in a
modern showbiz world.

The characters who are most nota-
ble, though, are Allen's supporting
cast of Lou Canova, played by Nick
Apollo Forte, _and Tina Vitale, por-
trayed by Mia Farrow. Forte is con-
vincing as the fat, tacky nightclub
singer who specializes in Italian nos-

talgia music. Rose pays special atten-

tion to Canova because, according to
him, nostalgia Muzak is making a big
comeback. Consequently, the movie
veers toward the singer's big date at
the Waldorf ballroom. '

The true _scene-stealer is Farrow as .

Vitale, the blonde B-5Z'd bimbo who
happens to be Canova’s illicit love

interest (he is already married to

another peroxide special). Canova
feels that he can't do the Waldorf
show without -her attendance so, on
the day of the show, he sends Rose to
pick her up and escort her to the
show. It's easier than it sounds, and
Rose spends most of the film trying
to get her there.

During this cat-and-mouse chase,
Vitale's association with the Jersey

* mafiosa gets Rose wronglyimarked to

be "taken care of" by two brothers of
the gangland family. As in most Allen
films, the resulting mayhem leads
Vitale to fall in love with the detached
Rose.

Throughout, Farrow shapes her
role with the unflinching air of a B-
movie ’mobster moll. She's delight-
fully saucy and cool, yet vulnerable to

the loser in Rose. It's already been _

said a million times, but this is her
best performance since Rosemary's
Baby.

Despite the good acting, Allen's
plot goes limp several times before it
ends quite abruptly and inconclu-
sively. Ultimately, it diminishes some
very fine performances by Farrow,
Forte and occasionally Allen.

Once again, Allen dwells on the
social stereotype: this time on the
thick-headed histrionics and gluttony
of a corrupt Italian family. These
scenes deliver a few laughs but most
of this has been done before. ~

However, there are some moments
in Broadway Danny Rose that showcase
Allen's often brilliant film-making
technique, especially the_ opening

' scene which shows a group of old cir-

cuit comedians telling war stories at

This is the day and age of remakes;
classic masterpieces such as Godard's
Breathless and I_ubitsch's To Be Or Not

recently remade. Hollywood's cur-

Unfaithfully Yours, an adaptation of
the witty Preston Sturges film of
1948, stars Dudley Moore, the Brit-

Arthur brought in more than $100
million at the box office. Since then,
however, Moore has starred in the
disastrous Six Weeks, the ill—fated

tassia with a J, thank you), an Italian
screenstar half his age. Despite the
age gap, the couple is extremely
happy until a series of misunder-
standings develops with a rather dim-
witted detective. It seems that the
detective, hired by Moore's manager,
Albert Brooks, has suggested to
Moore that while he was away on
tour, his wife hadn't remained faith-
fully his!!!

Even though the affair is one con-
ceived through circumstantial, coin-
cidental evidence, Moore, the
ever-so-jealous husband, believes
that his wife has indeed been cheat-
ing. Not only does he believe that she
has been unfaithful but that her lover
is his close friend and concert violi-
nist, Armand Assante.

Conducting Assante at Carnegie
Hall, Moore fantasizes the perfect
revenge — the murder of his wife and
the conviction of her lover as the cul-
prit. In order to follow through with
the plan to knock off his wife and
frame her lover, Moore concocts an
elaborate plan involving tape
recorders, camera surveillance equip-
ment, poison, champagne and Hallo-
ween masks.

However, the plan doesn't run as
smoothly as the dream, and one of

the more humorous scenes involves _
Moore's attempt to serve Assante 

champagne. Assante, however,
wants a Coke, and this sends Moore
scurrying about the house in an
attempt to acquire a can, screaming

Granted, this might be Moore's
best film since Arthur, but that's not
saying much. And although his pres-
ence as a leading man isn't as appeal-
ing as that of Rex Harrison (who
played the role in the original), he is
likeable. Natassja Kinski turns in a

credible performance as the wife, in‘

addition to capturing the screen with
her beauty. However, it is Richard
Libertini who steals the show with

his brillant portrayal of Moore's Ital-

ian valet’ and chef.

Llnfaithfully Yours isn't an extremely
refreshing or intelligent film; instead,
it's a light, somewhat funny comedy
that might pull Moore out of the box-
office basement. '

'Rear Window’

page 15

Reflecting Hitchcock's Brilliance

By RICHARD SATER

Alfred Hitchcock returns with ven-
geance. Early in the 1970s, he pulled
five of his films from circulation,
apparently hoping for a lucrative re-
distribution deal. After his death, the
films remained tied up in the estate
until recently. Universal arranged for
the rights last year and has started
reissuing the long—unseen pictures.

Rear Window proves that the wait
has been worthwhile. A never-again

cast . and la. never-again directorw

teamed for the film in 1954,- and the
result marks a career peak for all con-
cerned. The story centers on L.B. Jef-
feries (James Stewart), magazine

   

photographer, confined to a wheel-
chair with a broken leg and quite
bored. The back window of his apart-
ment looks over a courtyard shared
by the building opposite. From his
vantage point, Iefferies spies on his
unwitting neighbors for entertain-
ment. _

"It's diseased," pouts Lisa Fremont
(Grace Kelly), ]efferies' high-society
girlfriend. "Window shopper," sniffs
Stella_(Thelma Ritter), his nurse. But

‘ Rear Window vividly illustrates the

maxim about the idle brain being the
devil's; playground and then twists

the moral back over itself. The neigh- '

bors distract themselves with their
daily routine; Iefferies, his lifestyle
temporarily interrupted, finds loose
time on his hands. "Nothing to do but
look out the window at the neigh-
bors,” he says.

Iefferies casually follows the mini-
ature dramas unfolding across the
yard -— the lonely lady who drinks
herself to sleep, the ballet dancer
with boys in ardent pursuit, the tra-
velling salesman (Raymond Burr)
continually bickering with his invalid
wife. Iefferies remains a contentedly
bemused voyeur until the salesman's
wife abruptly disappears. Connecting
what facts he has, Iefferies concludes
that murder has taken place. ‘

Although Lisa disagrees with his
"rear window ethics,” she succumbs
to the temptation after hearing the
details. Stella, too, reluctantly enters
the game. The police turn up nothing;
Iefferies, with Lisa providing the leg-
work, continues the search on his
own, with unforseen results.

Tension builds slowly, layering
small incidents over one another and

building toward an inevitable release.
]efferies' growing obsession with the
suspicious activities across the court-
yard leads him to binoculars and,
finally, to a long—focus camera lens to
scrutinize details even more closely.

Hitchock keeps the action confined .

to Jefferies's viewpoint —— his apart-
ment and that which can be seen
from its rear window —- generating
empathy for his entrapment. Street
noises, vehicles and passing pedestri-
ans provide glimpses of the world

i . beyond the realm of the'backyard._

Hitchcock chose his cast with accu-
racy; James Stewart lends his homey
"Stewartness" and iron-gray solidity
to the role of the photographer, suc-
cinctly convincing as he conveys the
frustration of unsolicited inactivity.’
Grace Kelly's attractive cool provides
a neat, fashionable opposite as she
stalks her reluctant man. She's "per-
fect, as always,” he complains — evi-
dence that they are ill-matched.

Thelma Ritter's Stella completes
the trio, dispensing backrubs, sand-
wiches and advice freely. Raymond
Burr is effectively menacing as the
supposed murderer, and Wendell
Corey plays a suitably colorless
detective pal of Stewart's.

Alfred Hitchcock had been honing

‘his directing skills since the 19.205,

and Rear Window stands as perhaps his
highest achievement, a perfect and
well-balanced blend of parts. Diffi-

i dent Stewart, seductive Kelly and

wry Ritter mix for unmatchable
chemistry; the suspense is palpably
and nail-bitingly real; and the Hitch-
cock themes about middle-brow
facades, love chance and human
weakness remain intact. Bravo!

1984
Van Halen
Warner ‘Bros.

In spite of the frenzy-
fingered artistry of guitarist
Eddie Van Halen, 1984, the
band's latest release, holds a low

flame to the resurgence of’

heavy metal that Def Leppard
and Quiet Riot ignited in 1983.

Straying aimlessly from the
concept that earned Van Ha-

tial critical acclaim in addition to
overwhelming commercial suc-
cess, 1984»p1ods through too
much territory that has long
been worn down by heavy
metal. '

Although the hard rock rave-
up "Top Jimmy" and the synth-
heavy "Jump" are sure to induce
increased circulation, the sup-
porting cast is all too meager.
There are only two songs,
"Panama," which is nothing
short of dazzling, and the out-

cute, talented, leader-type who
all the girls like; Mick Fleet-

wood’s ridiculously tall and

bizarre-looking, but the band's
name is taken from his own so
he must be important; John
McVie plays bass, and since all
bass-players’ talents go unno-
ticed, no one pays much atten-

tion to. him; Stevie Nicks is .

perhaps "the most celebrated
member, as famous for her

' beliefs in witches and faeries as

she is for he: husky voice. And
then there's Christine McVie,
too often known just as "Fleet-
wood Mac's other girl,” who's

. all but ignored it seems, simply

because she doesn't make a
spectacle out of herself on stage
or in video by trying to act like a
ballerina way past her prime.
But McVie, perhaps as tired
of her own boring image as the
rest of us, has finally struck
back with this self-entitled
effort. It's quiet, even unobtru-
sive in a manner of speaking,
but nonetheless, a winner
where it really counts. McVie
has always possessed one of the
best female voices in contem-
pory music, and it's a pleasure to
hear her on 10 songs instead of
the two or three she usually

contributes on a Mac album. A’

,soft,.lilting voice, it nonetheless
possesses a soulful quality and
an appealing deep timbre that
meshes perfectly with her
blueslpop style music.

She has no trouble churning
out potential singles; "Got A
Hold On Me" is already gather-
ing an audience, and songs like
"Love Will Show Us How,"
"One In A Million” and "So
Excited” could do the same. All
material is in the mold of "Over

LIL

weight champion of hard rock.
Outside of these occasional vic-
tories, there is nothing of the
witty irreverance and arrogant
muscle-flexing that Van Halen
once balanced so well with
respectful cover material and
fine texturing of their arena-
sized sound. Instead, 1984,
leans regretfully closer to the
band's most recent offering, the
haphazard Diver Down.

The drivel begins at the close
of side one with the concrete
rhythm of "Drop Dead Legs”
and regresses to a complete
waste of wax on side two after

i "Hot for Teacher" opens things.

"Girl Gone Bad," the predictable
story of a girl who's busy
"shakin' poor boys down" and
the intolerable "House of Pain”
bring a merciful close to this,
Van Halen's fifth record.

Is it lead singer David Lee
Roth's dreadful posing and
vocal crowing that's got Van
Halen in a bind? Maybe, but
more likely, the problem runs
deeper. Although Eddie Van
Halen's_ guitar playing is unpar-

I

My Head," "Say You Love Me”
and "Don't Stop” —— in other
words, it's good, solid pop,
backed up with talent and hard
work. V

Interesting asides: "Ask
Anybody," a beautiful, blues
rocker in the tradition of early
Eric Clapton, features McVie in
duet with Steve Winwood;
Lindsay Buckingham plays gui-
tar on "The Smile I Live For";
and Clapton himself adds a
clean-cut guitar solo to ”The

Challenge.”
I-‘leetwood Mac's future J

‘seems a bit uncertain at the

moment, but if you're a fan,
don't despair; console yourself
with Christine McVie, a whole
album's worth of finely crafted

around in endless layers of chif-
fon in order to get noticed.

NEW SONG
Howard Jones

. Elektra

Here's another Brit with
funny-colored hair and an irres-
istible dance single trying to pop
his way onto the American
charts. His name is’ Howard
Jones, but after playing his
debut ep, New Song, he might as
well be another Mr. Smith. A

That aforementioned single is
”New Song," and it really snags
the old tympanic membrane. It's
a synthesizer throwaway that
sounds like Steve Winwood’s
interpretation of Peter Gabriel's
"Solsbury Hill." That's ‘ the
musical end of things — the lyr-
ics are the same old story. /‘I
don't wanna be hip & cool/I
don't wanna play by the rules,"
boast the words that are penned
on the back of the album, right

. next to the picture of Jones in

his multi—colored hairdo. How's
that for irony?

The rest of New Song, two
more songs not counting the
extended version of the title cut,
doesn't rate too well. In fact,
they were probably both writ-
ten to extend the package price
to $4.99 and pay for another
color treatment.

If "New Song" is ever released
as a single, it would be worth
the listen. Otherwise, New Song,
the ep, asks too much for its
generic brand of music.

denied that they do attain some
degree of amiability with the lis-
tener if he's devoted enough to
allow himself to be drawn into
their world more than once.
Even in their native Britain, The
Cure doesn't have an abun-
dance of recorded material
available, so maybe that's why
their decidedly small following
is so loyal —— meaning that it's
more difficult to get bored (and
easier to get obsessed)_ with
them because of their
unavailability.

Japanese Whispers, their latest

release (the band's first full-.

length lp for Sire Records),
probably won't do much to
endear them to the hearts of
those who are not already fans,
but it's an electric release none-
theless. Featuring material
from last summer's mini-lp The
Walk and various maxi-singles
from_last year, Japanese Whispers
doesn't suffer from being pieced
together like this; instead, it
seems to be bonded together
through -the paranoid rum-
blings of main man Robert
Smith. Smith, whose voice is
the most recognizable feature
of The Cure, sounds like a man
who's just been told that he
failed all the tests and will be
locked up for good. Edgy, psy-
chotic and audibly agitated, he's
the ringmaster of this musical
circus, pulling us through the
phony cheerfulness of ”Let's Go
To Bed," the dense forboding of
the "The Upstairs Room" and
the synthetic rockabilly of
"Love Cats." Smith & Co. may
never become mass-market
appeal artists, but their mad-
men brand of pop is nothing
short of interesting.

SOUVENIRS FRESH AND
RANCID . A
Alfred Adler
Grove Press

The inside jacket of Alfred Adler's
Souvenirs Fresh and Rancid reads, "These

L are lively, anecdotal reminiscences of

one of America's finest educators."
Well, they are anecdotes, but the
question is: how lively are they? The
answer is — not very. The jacket also
says, ”Poignant and humorous.”
Poignant? Perhaps. Humorous?
Rarely.

Oh, theebook has its moments; in
fact, that's all it is — a series of separ-
ate moments that are not very well

i V tied together. There is no way to get

caught up in the book. The first part
consists of small clippings of inci-

 

dents from Adler's memory — fine if
the clippings are able to stand on their
own; the problem here is that they
don't. I

The chapters that make up the first
half of the book are filled with count-
less people. And again, there's
nothing wrong with that, but here
the characters appear for a few para-
graphs and usually are never heard
from again. They just sort of disap-
pear and are replaced by equally bland
characters who, in turn, have their
moments in the spotlight before
Adler sweeps them away. '

After a point you begin to ask your-
self: what was the point of that char-
acter? What did that chapter have to
do with the one before it? And then
there's the big question —- exactly
why was this book written?» Maybe
Alfred just wanted to clean out his
files. But the point is, the book takes
off in a thousand directions and never

A gets anywhere. ’

The most disturbing part, how-
ever, is Adler himself. Adler is
annoyed by snobs, which is under-
standable enough, but not ‘when
Adler comes across a rather large one

himself. He is simply cruel, vindictive .

and arrogant. He is also witty, butnot
enough so to overcome his own ego.
That is not to say the book does not
have any redeeming qualities. There
are two. It is short (124 pages), and

the footnotes are, in fact, very amus-
‘ ing. But considering the cover price

($14.95), why bother?

CROME YELLOW AND OTHER

WORKS
ANTIC HAY

S AFTER MANY A SUMMER DIES

THE SWAN
By Aldous Huxley
Harper Colophon

British author Aldous Huxley

' wrote much else besides Brave New

World. Three volumes of his works
have been issued, newly reprinted
and colorfully wrapped.

Crome Yellow, Huxley's first novel
(1921), depicts the unhappy love
affair of a young and rather wistfully
insipid poet, Denis Stone, with most

' of the action taking place at C-rome,

the country home ofHenry Wimbush

it —— who is important because his

neice, Anne, is Denis's, affection-
object. Good fun.

Three shorter pieces are included
in the volume with Crome. ”Ape and
Essence," "a Utopian tale, takes the
form of a script for a colossal movie.
The girl with ”The Gioconda Smile"
seems ”ugly on purpose," but she car-
ries a torch for her employer. A per-
verse love story, "The Genius and the
Goddess" serves as a response to the
practice of lionizing biographical
information.

/lntic Hay (1923) depicts the adven-
tures of proper English teacher Theo-
dore Grumbril Jr., who decides to
drop his stifling habitof conventional
life and search for something better.
Huxleyconcisely paints the Roaring
Twenties — skeptics and hedonists
and the uncertain values that charac-
terized the decade.

Last and best" of the collection is

1939's After Many a_ Summer Dies the
Swan, a Hollywood novel steeped in
Movieland myth ‘and glitter and
proper name-dropping. Jo Stoyte,
multi—millionaire, literally possesses
all that money buys, except he wants
something more and -—— heretofore, at
any rate —— unavailable: eternal life.
"Everything is possible," says his doc-
tor; the results prove harrowing.
Aldous Huxley’s fiction possesses
an essay—like quality, not quite
preachy but decidedly moralistic. His
concern is mankind, however, and his
weapon is skilled satire which --

incidentally — entertains with

enthusiasm.

3 Pitt ready to run at Big East Championships  

P Panthers return to Butler, Lady Panthers

ﬁ

By Dale Moore
The Pitt News

The Pitt men’s track team returns
to the scene of the crime this week

end as they travel to Syracuse, N.Y., _V
to .compete in the Big East indoor

track and field championships.

Last year, the Panthers, under the
direction of Coach John Vasvary,
stole the show at the Carrier Dome
as they came home with second
place, losing only to national power-
house Villanova. This year, Vasvary
is hoping for the same type of sur-
prise but believes it will be more dif-
ficult to repeat.

“This year, we lost some real key S

people who helped us do well," said
Vasvary.

Among the missing, besides the
four graduated members of last
year’s team ‘will be Big East indoor
shot put champion Bob Buckowski,
who is out with aishoulder injury,
and last year's 300-meter dash cham-
pion, Brian Pollack, who will
become eligible to run track in April.

Vasvary isn’t sure exactly what to
expect except intense competition.

“It's hard to say how we’ll do this
year," Vasvary said. “Villanova is
very strong and went across the
ocean to shore up any weaknesses

Qhey did have. A .

“Seton Hall did the same thing.

jumper, long jumper and high
jumper. They ’ also have two real
good hurdlers. lfVillanova stumbles
at all, Seton Hall could catch them.
In fact, Villanova may not have to
stumble.

“Georgetown has a triple jumper
with the bestjump in the conference
and some very good middle distance
people. St. Johns, Syracuse and
Connecticut have» good people all
around and some great ones in cer-
tain events. They are all very team-
oriented and very good at totaling
points.

“Boston College has some good
people in different events and Provi-
dence has a strong distance corp and
will have a lot to say about how
Villanova does point wise."

As for the Panthers, their fate may
depend on the younger members of
the squad. The Panthers need a good
performance from their underclass-
men this weekend if they are to
repeat their success of last year. '

“A freshman can do one of two
things when hegoes to a champion-
ship meet; he can get caught up in
the excitement of the meet and do
very well, or he can feel the pressure
and do very poorly,” said Vasvary.
“There’s a greater chance of panic if
they haven't been there before.”

The competition that these young
Panthers will be facing is some of the
best in the nation. *

“The Big East is strong from the
400 [meter run] up to the mile and all
the relays," said Vasvary. “Last year

in the two-mile relay, Pitt, George-
town and Villanova competed at
nationals. This year, those three plus
St. John's have qualified for nation-
als in the distance medley relay. To
get fourth in the conference in the
distance medley relay, you are going
to have to qualify foi nationals.“

With tne number of contending
teams this year, the meet could come
down to the last event. Few points
should separate the top five teams,
and you would probably be just as
far ahead to pull the teams out of a
hate as to try to predict who will end
up where. Vasvary summed it up
best. “It all depends on who’s on and
who‘s not."

And all Vasvary can do is hope,
like last year, the Panthers are on.

excited about prospects"

The Pitt News

This weekend, the Lady Panther
track team travels to Syracuse, N.Y.,
to participate in the Big East
women’s track championships.

According to Coach Elbert
Kennedy, there is a difference in
perspectives betweenthis meet and
last year’s championship, where Pitt
tied with Boston College for fifth
place. This year, along with the
sprint events, the Lady Panthers will

also be competitive in the middle-

distance events since the addition of
freshmen Edith Butler and Felicia
Blake. A

‘‘I’m excited,” Butler said about
the championships. “If the competi-
tion is there, I have a good chance of
qualifying for the ' NCAA
[championsl-iips].”

More importantly, though, their
presence will supply the squad with
an added boost of enthusiasm and
confidence.

Even though the team has taken a
more serious outlook onecompeti-
tion as a team, Butler’s outgoing per-
sonality has benefited other runners.

“She’s fun, and she perks us all up
when ‘we're not feeling altogether
inspired, sprinter Gail Counts said.

“Sometimes, I think if we didn’t
have Edith, we wouldn’t make it,"
Sue Torre added. “She’s just really
good to have around.”

“She’s having a good year," he‘

said. “There's no complaints about
Edie.”

The one event to which the Lady
Panthers are looking forward this

weekend is the 1,600-meter relay,.

with the squad of Blake, Counts,
Butler and Renee Henderson. Last
year, the relay placed third, and
expectations for a better finish are
higher this time.

“I’m excited about our [l,600-
meter] relay," junior sprinter Renee
Henderson said. “We have runners
who are more serious about track.”

“It's an event every [big school]
likes," Kennedy said. “There's a lot .

of pride involved."

In other events, Henderson will
defend her 1983 Big East title in the
50- and 300-meter dashes, and Amy
DiFrancesco, who also had a per-
sonal best time in the 3,000-_meter
run last weekend, will compete in the
same event at Syracuse.

ThePlttNews

. Tomorrow’s Big East basket-
ball matchup between Pitt and
St. J ohn‘s at noon should prove
to be a close game. _

Actually, that statement is
only three-fourths true. Based on
three key factors, the game will
be even. As for the fourth, well,

_ that one should make the New

York fans leave Alumni Hall
with smiling faces.

0 Both teams have recently put
their losing ways behind them

and put together a pair of win-‘ '

ning streaks.

Pitt's 67-59 victory over Notre
Dame Wednesday night was the
team’s third straight win. Over
the past week and a half, the
Panthers have also muscled out
wins over Villanova at Fitzgerald
Field House and at Connecticut.

St. J ohn’s, after experiencing a
midseason drought similar to

— Pitt’s, has come on to defeat both

Boston College and Connecticut.

0 Both teams rely primarily on
one scorer — Clyde Vaughan for
the Panthers and Chris Mullin
for St. John’s.

That’s not to say that the two
teams don’t have other capable
scorers, it's just that thesetwo

-players are the ones on whom

each team counts, game in and
game out, to lead the scoring.

Vaughan is slightly off last
year's Big East leading pace, hov-
ering at 18 points per game. Mul-
lin, on the other hand, is ahead of
his 1982-83 average, accounting
for more than 23 points per
game. He is currently the leading
candidate to dethrone .Vaughan
as conference scoring champ.

0 Each team has a functional
front line.

With the recent success of Pitt
big men Keith Armstrong, Chip
Watkins and Andre Williams,

. the Panthers can play that game 

with some degree of confidence
for the first time all season.

St. John’s had an established
front line coming in to the cur-

rent season, led by the twin tow-
ers, 6-l0 Jeff Allen and 7-0 Bill
Wennington.

At times, Coach Lou Carn-
secca has had both players in the

‘ game at the same time, making it

tough for the opposition to see
the backboard, let alone get a
rebound off it.

0 The one outstanding factor
in anyone’s favor, the home
court advantage —— goes to the
Redmen. ‘

Although the two schools have
split the series over the past two
seasons, 2-2, St. John‘s has dom-
inated in New York. While the
Panthers have won their two
games at Fitzgerald by a com-
bined three points, St. John’s has

» outscored Oakland’s team by 29

back East.
Included in that total are a 64-
53 win in the quarterfinals of the

‘Big East Tournament at Madi-

son Square Garden last year and
a 91-73 shellacking at the Red-
men’s campus home, Alumni
Hall, the site of Saturday’s
battle.

Pitt explodes at Big
East swim opener

By Gabrielle Pease
And Michael Weinman
The Pitt News

The Pitt Panther men’s swim
team has taken a commanding 106-
point lead over its nearest competi-
tor after the first round of the 1984
Big East Swimming and Diving
Championships last night at Trees
Pool.

Outstanding performances by the
men’s swimming and diving teams
highlighted the action between these
East Coast rivals.

Meet records were broken by such
aggressive competitors as Ed Bahan,
Don Martin, Rick James, Greg
Murphy and diver Mike McCalley.

Freshman Rick James led the
night‘s successes with a record-
breaking performance in the men’s
200-meter individual medley (IM).
With a time of 1.53.73, he estab-

Senior Ed Bahan pulled out in

front of the pack during the 50-
meter freestyle with a time of 20.97,
another new Big East meet record.

The final kick that put Pitt firmly

over the top came during the long
and grueling 800—meter relay with
astonishing accomplishments by Ed

. Bahan. Don Martin, Rick James
and anchor Greg Murphy.

In the men‘s three-meter diving,

Pitt snatched the top four places
Wednesday, scoring 65 points for
the team. Sophomore Mike McCal-
ley set a new meet record with a total
score of 461.35.

The Panther lead was streng-

thened by fine performances by
freestylers J-.D. McCrillis and Greg
Murphy and medley swimmers Don
Martin and Ed Bergan.

Returning sophomore divers

Mark McCormick and John Dusch
took second and third places respec-
tively, on the three-meter board.
Freshman Chris Blair took fourth
place.

lished a new Big East meet record.

° Sophomore Todd Mulzet placed

sixth, beating the former five-time
Syracuse champion, Mike Bowden.
Freshman diver Jeff Luffey racked
up extra points with a ninth-place
finish. ‘

“With our high degrees of diffi-
culty in our dives...we’re certainly
competing nationally,” said Pitt div-
ing coach Julian Krug.

PITTSBURGH

Pitt will be led by seniors
Roger Kingdom and Todd
Colas. Colas is the defending
1000-meter champion at the
meet, and Kingdom was named
outstanding performer at the
meet last year, based on a second
in the 55-meter hurdles and
another silver in the high jump.
Another senior, Ralph Mitton,
has one of the longest triple
jumps in the conference this sea-

son and'looks to challenge for
.the

gold. Freshmen middle-
distance runners Tim Manes and
Alan Laws will play an impor-
tant part in the Panther fortunes
this weekend, participating in
relays as well as individual
events.

Also helping the Panther
cause will be senior Garland
Brown, who is scheduled for the
distance medley relay and the
800-meter run. Joe McCall and
Brian Davis will compete in the
sprints and Andrew Lewis and
Randy Dixon will throw the
shot. Also in the field events,
Rodney Chobany will try to bet-
ter his sixth place finish in the
pole vault at last year’s meet.

The Panthers have a quality
team but lack the depth to keep
up with the likes of Seton Hall
and Villanova in the team scor-
ing. Anything above third place
would be exceptional.

The Lady Panther basketball
team (14-9 overall, 5-1 in the Big
East) faces a tough test tomorrow
evening whengit knocks heads with
the over-six—foot club, the Syracuse
Orangewomen;

Despite their 12-13 season mark,
Syracuse certainly poses a threat to
Pitt’s inside game of Jennifer Bruce.

By Bob Green

The Pitt News

The Panther gymnasts (1 1-1),
coming off a big victory over Illinois
(Chicago) last week, travel to East-
ern Michigan for a meet at 7:30 p.m.
tonight.

Pitt set three school records
against Illinois. The all-around, the
parallel bar and the high bar marks
were erased by sophomores Mark
Klafter and Matt Peters.

Eastern Michigan, who has been
scoring in the low 2005, is far from
what the Panthers consider a strong
team. Pitt has been scoring in the
area of 255-260, so the Michigan
boys should provide little
competition.

“This is an important score meet
for us,” said head coach Frank
D’Amico. “We are looking for
scores high enough
Nationals.”

The NCAA championships will
be held at UCLA, starting on March

12. Potential competitors from Pitt

to get to"

anticipates a “battle in this Big East
matchup. “We hope we can control
the boards," Jacobs said. “We want
to play aggressive defense and take
them out of their game.”

The Orangewomen defeated Pitt
last season to even the series at 2-2,
but they have lost several key play-
ers. Anne Flannery and Mary Schi-
vetta combined for.22.7 points and
12.7 rebounds per game, but both
have graduated.

A shoulder dislocation to Jadeane

0

Panthers aim for higher scores

to be in the meet are Klafter, Peters
and senior Dave Smith.

If these gymnasts are to qualify
for Nationals, more schoolrecords
may very well be broken this
weekend.

Despite the obvious lack ofdecent
competition, D’Amico said that he
has no intentions of employing some
of the lesser-used athletes.

Senior Frank Kratz, also a possi-
ble candidate for Nationals, will
again be unable to compete in the
all—around (six events -— the floor
exercise, the pommel horse, the still
rings, the vault, the parallel bar and
the high bar) because of a pulled
muscle in his right arm.

“My arm is still a little sore,"i
e Kratz said, “but it is coming around

slowly.”

With the season winding down,
tonight's meet carries importance
not only on the individual perfor-
mance, but the Panthers must also
score well as a team if they are again
to finish the season in the Top 20. In
1983, Pitt finished in the No. 18 slot.

Daye has forced Jacobs to insert
freshman Janice Long into the point
guard spot, which she has handled
since December.

According to Pitt’s Jennifer
Bruce, the final outcome of last
year's game, 79-70, was not an accu-
rate reflection of the true gap in each
team’s level of play. “We played
badly last year, but I think we’re
more confident now,” she said.

TheJLad,y Panthers have reason to
be confident. Their 5-1 conference
mark sets them apart from the four

teams tied for second place at 4-2
(Villanova, St. John’s, Providence
and Seton Hall). Pitt has defeated all
but Seton Hall and has won four of
its last five games.

Syracuse is in sixth place at 3-3.
Pitt coach Judy Saurer believes that
Syracuse’s Chris Palombi may be
the best center in the Big East, but
Saurer maintained that Pitt has no
more at stake at this meeting than at

any other Big East game.

Pitt has nothing at stake — except
a No. 1 ranking in the conference.

SYRACUSE

Orangemen coach Andy
Jugan felt last year's fourth-place
finish in the indoor champion-
ships was a disappointment. This
year, he plans to finish no lower
than fourth but has his eyes set
on loftier heights.

With returning 55-meter dash
champion Mike Morris and a
large amount of upperclassmen,
Syracuse may have the horses to
make the run for the top.

Paul Orsillo leads the Orange-
men in the pole vault with a
height of I5-5. Joining Orsillo in
the field events will be Eric
Decker, who placed third in the
shot last year, and Hugh Tracey
in the long jump, where he also
captured the bronze a year ago.

The Orangemen are tough and
have the home ﬁeld advantage
this weekend but can’t match up
on the track. Look for nothing
better than fourth for .Iugan’s
squad.

ST. JOHN'S

‘St. John’s looks impressive
this year as graduation did little
to hurt their team.

The Redmen are a very com-
plete team, showing strong depth
and a few exceptional per-

formers along side many quality
athletes. Sprinter Frank King
should help the cause, along with
Big East outdooriilong jump
champion Earl Gamble.

St. John's is a competitive
team, but don't look for them to
improve upon their fifth-place
finish of last year.

CONNECTICUT

The Huskies are 9-0 in compe-
tition so far this season and have
balance in all events. However,-
graduation took its toll on last
season’s number-three team in
the Big East, and they return to
the Dome minus four-time high
jump champion Bob Hopson
and all the members of the 35-
pound weight throw team that
totaled 20 points in last year's
competition.

Returning this season are
Mike England in the 1500-meter
run and Carl Dean in the 55-
meter dash. Also, junior Robin
Petgrave will compete in the 55-
meter hurdles, dash, high and
long jumps and the relay.

The Huskies won't be able to
make upithe ground lost by grad-
uation. Better than sixth would
be a suprise.

GEORGETOWN
The Hoyas have a couple of
outstanding performers, and

Huskies an underdog at championships

that’s all. Look for good results
from middle distance specialists
Kevin King and Brian McNellis
and jumper Raymond Humph-
rey. '

Maybe the Hoyas should go to
Atlantic City this weekend
because seven pays there and the

seventh they get in Syracuse
won't.

PROVIDENCE

Coach Bob Amato couldn't be
reached to comment about the
Friars. He may be hiding some-
thing. This weekend, he may
wish he could. Eighth by default.

BOSTON COLLEGE

According to Coach Jack
McDonald, the Eagles figure to
be a factor in deciding the meet
and place very high in the team
standings.

“We could be anywhere from
second to seventh," said
McDonald.

Could this be the year that per-
ennial celler-dweller Boston Col-
lege makes a run for the top, their
chance for glory?

Nah. Look for a battle with
Georgetown and Providence for
the privilege of being last.

Reunion
Nellis brothers back together

as grapplers meet Clarion

By Charlie O'Hara
The Pitt News

The Pitt wrestling team faces
another stiff challenge tomorrow
when Clarion visits Fitzgerald Field
House for a 2 p.m. match.

Clarion (7-3—l) is ranked No. l5 in
the country. The meeting marks the
sixth straight match in which the
Panthers have met with teams
ranked in the top 25.

This Eastern Wrestling League
confrontation will feature several
good individual matchups.

Pitt's ll8-pounder, Hal Bolin,
will do battle with Randy Richards.

“Hal knows going into it that
Randy has beaten some pretty good
people in the past couple weeks,”
said Chuck Coryea, the Panther
assistant coach. “Hal is capable of
beating him."

At the 134-pound class, however,
the Panthers probably don't have
anyone who can defeat Clarion’s
Mark Ciccarella.

Ciccarella is presently ranked No.
l in the country. John Hnath has

Lady gymnasts

face Penn State

By Wes Cotter
The Pitt News

The national rankings for colle-
giate women's gymnastics came out
this week, and Pitt found itself tied
with Penn State for l6th place.

That means when Pitt and Penn
State meet this Saturday night at
Trees Hall, the Lady Panthers will
be trying to do something that has
never has been done in the history of
Pitt's women's gymnastics. Beat
Penn State.

‘‘I think we’re going to have a very
close meet,” Lady Panther coach
Donna Sanft said. “Whoever ‘hits
will win. I think the meet will be
decided by tenths of a point.”

“I know it will be a great meet,”
Lady Lion coach Jane Avener said.
“It's terrific that we're tied. I'm so
glad to see Pitt back in the fight after
last year. I know it will be a great
meet."

In addition to the tie in the rank-
ings, the two teams have been receiv-
ing scores that are so close that
they're almost interchangeable. _

The Lady Lions have been averag-
ing scores of I78, with a low of 175
last weekend. Pitt has been averag-
ing slightly below I78 but received a
l78.l two weeks ago at West
Virginia.

“When Penn State walks into the
gym, that will be pretty intimidat-
ing." Sanft said. “But we're a good
team. We want to stay calm and use
our preparation."

Avener said that her team is
“healthy and ready to go."

The deciding factor ot this meet,
according to Avener, is the amount
of rest Penn State will receive before
meeting Pitt Saturday.

The Lady Lions were on the road
last weekend and will compete
against West Virginia on Friday
night.

“We're pretty tired. I don't think
it's gonna be a great meet for us, but
we're up for it," Avener said.

“We really have to pull together."
team captain Karen Martin said.
“The main thing that we have on
Penn State is experience. They have
younger girls, and we have older
ones. They have a lot more freshmen
in the lineup. I think our girls have to
watch what they're doing instead of
the other team. I think we can do it.
They scored a l75 last week."

been wrestling well late}, for Pitt,
but it is highly doubtful that he will
be able to step up to this level of
competition.

The closest match of the contest
may be between Pitt's Joe Throck-
morton and Rich Barron of Clarion.

“They've got a real solid guy in_

Rich Barron," Coryea said. “Joe
hurt his shoulder and is questionable
for Saturday, but if he is ready he'll
be tough to beat.”

Pitt's .Io.e Bond battles Glenn
Ammon in a I58-pound duel that
could forseeably end in a draw. In
the heavyweight division, Curtis
Conner wrestles Kirk Butryn of
Clarion.

“Both are fairly tough,” Coryea
commented. “We need a win from
Curtis if we plan on upsetting them."

A bit ofa reunion of sorts will take
place at the Field House for the
Robert Nellis family of Shaler
Township. Sons Kyle of Pitt and
Ken of Clarion will compete.

Although it will not be an individual
matchup, the brothers should pro-
vide their family and others in
some quality

attendance with

wrestling.

 

Ken, a senior, is the third-ranked
I50-pounder in the the country,
while Kyle, a sophomore, grapples
at the 126-pound level and has com-
piled an impressive match record of
26-6.

Pitt senior Jeff Jelic should have

i no trouble in his match in the 167-

pound slot. Jelic seems to be headed
for the top seven or eight slots. In the
past two weeks, Jelic has defeated
the No. 7, 8, and 9 men in the
country.

For Pitt to have a legitimate shot
at beating Clarion, what happened
last season cannot happen
tomorrow.

“We were real flat last year, and
we got beat," Coryea said. “We have
to get a good start. In the last couple
matches, we have had a tough time
in the opening matches. If we can get
a good start, we have a real good
shot because we’re at home."

Tomorrow marks the final home
match of the season for Pitt. Seniors
Tim Dinger, Dan Kasperkoski, Dan

'Lecce, Frank Rich, Throckmorton

and Jelic will be honored as they are
wrestling for the last time at the
Field House.

PPC coffeehouse resumes tonight

“By David McGraw
For The Pitt News

The Pitt Program Council's stu-
dent coffeehouse is back again, and

i a lot of changes have been made

since the old coffeehouse known as
“The Lair" closed its doors in 1981.

“We now have such better facili-
ties that it has to be better," said
Assistant Director of Student Activ-
ities Joyce Giangarlo. It is now
located in the Multi-Purpose Room
of the William Pitt Union.

According to Giangarlo, “The
Lair” was put out of business
because of the renovation of the stu-
dent union with the understanding
that it would be brought back when
the facilities were available again.
The PPC coffeehouse committee
was created last fall and was respon-
sible for five fairly successful coffee-
house programs duringthe fall term.
The first coffehouse for the winter
term is iotlay and features Gary Vin-
cent 0:1 me stage. -

“Coffeehouses don't do too well
on college campuses today,” said
committee chairman Kathy Hoel.
Despite this, however, Hoel said she
feels that Pitt’s coffeehouse program
was very successful in the fall. The
average turnout was between 150
and 200 students, and the most pop-
ular program, featuring the reggae
band The Core, drew a turnout of
around 400 people.

Part of the reason that coffee-
houses do not do too well at many
colleges could be a reaction to the

V changing times. “We are now out of

the '60s’ image,” Hoel said. PPC
adviser Gina Miller agreed.

“You used to be able to bring in an
acoustic guitarist, and people would
show up,” Miller said. She said she
feels the reason Pitt’s coffeehouse
program has been an exception to
the trend is that the committee
strives to create a unique image.
“Nowhere else in Oakland do you
find this atmosphere," she said.

The coffeehouse does not charge
students and is funded by the stu-
dent activity fee.

“I feel that it is a responsible use of

the students’ activity fee,” commit-
tee member Phil Pittsford said. He
admitted no program can satisfy
everyone but explained that the
committee does its best to get stu-
dent interaction and present a wide
variety of types of programs.

“We provide a service for the stu-
dents who need an alternative,"
committee member Lynn Buzzell

” said. The programs are chosen by

students on the commitee, she said.
The committee votes on the ﬁnal
decision to be certain the entertain-
ment appeals to a wide variety of
students. .

The purpose of the coffeehouse,
according to Hoel, is to provide a
place where students can gather in
an intimate atmosphere for an even-
ing of entertainment.

“Many of the students are too
young to get into the bars, and so
they have no place to go," she said.

The entertainment planned for
this term ranges from jazz to
comedy. On Feb. 21, those students
who have musical talent will have an
opportunity to perform on stage.
