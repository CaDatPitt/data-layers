Prickly Heat In December Becomes
- Just Case Of ‘Mistletoe’ Poisoning

Two of the more botanically inclin-
ed of the University professors were
dining out in an Oakland restaurant
recently. As they were sipping their
consomme, they looked about at the
gay Christmas trimmings of the eat-
ery and were amazed to see that the
festoons of greenery were none other
than poison ivy.

The manager was summoned, and
gently told the nature of his ﬂoral
species. “I was wondering,” he told
his informers, “what was making my
waitresses get prickly heat at this
time of the year.”

The gentleman of the restaurant
and other laymen interested in a bit
of trimmings at Christmas time might
do well to read a.n article in the De-

cember “Nature Notes,” magazine
published by the Biology Teachers’
Club, in which Dr. 0. E. Jennings,
head of the biology department, dis-
cusses special ﬂora of Christmas.

Pine and ﬁr trees, holly, and mis-
tletoe, comprise the total of Christmas
greenery for most people, yet Dr. Jen-
nings lists no less than 25 different
specimens of holid y ﬂora, many of
them native to the state. Mountain
laurel, log moss, smilax, and sea-
lavendar are among the recommended
decorations. And if you still cling
to old-fashioned Christmas decora-
tions for the house, phoradendron
ﬂavescens, known as mistletoe by the
curb ﬂower vendors, still remains a
best seller.

New Day Dawns
In Prom Publicity

Junior Prom Publicists To Spurn
Byronic Phrases In Campaign

The School
day.

Now publicists for the Junior Prom
have decided that another day is
dawning.

No longer will “colossal, stupend-
ous, magniﬁcent” burn up the linotype
machines.

No longer will chairmen proclaim
loudly (in quotations furnished by
their press agent reporters) that
their dance is going to be the “great-
est event of the school year,” their
band “the smoothest musicians ever
to gladden the ears of dance mani-
acs,” their dance partner “a queen, or
a goddess.”

All this according to A. W. Schenck,
BA37, chairman of the Junior Prom
and his cohorts.

“We are going to sell our dance on
its own merits,” says Chairman
Schenck.

“We are preparing an intelligent
campaign of psychological interest,
and we are cutting out the superla-
tives in our advertisements.”

The ﬁrst step of the publicity com-
mittee was to hang up white bill-

of Byron has had its

boards with a. .red. stocking- and. the

motto, “Hang up your sock for a Jun-
for Prom ticket.” (Get the psycholog-
ical -import?) '

Its second step is to present the
following 18-point program (with apol-
ogies to SFA):

1. Place—Hotel Schenley.

2. Date—January 17, 1935.

3. Assessment——$.50 to .$12 per cou-
ple (inclusive).

4. Time—10 till 2.

5. Orchestra——Naturally.

6. Who—-That’s our Worry, too.

7. Formal——Try and get past Dau-
fenbach without one.

8. Guests and chaperons—we have
to. .

9. Comps—see Mr. Biddle or make
a deal with a committee member.

10. Date—Cwen Directory (two
bits).

11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18-——to be
announced later.

Woman’s Place In The Home,
Says WUP Journal Writer

 

Under the editorial wing of Mrs.
Agnes L, Starrett, assistant professor
of English, the University history for
the sesqui-centennial celebration is
rapidly taking form. Old documents
and relics of the early years of the
University are being unearthed, dis-
covered, and thrust categorically into
the spacious Starrett ﬁling cabinet.

The collected material is an excel-
lent factual study of thought in the
days when our grandfathers trudged
up the steps to the Western Univer-
sity of Pennsylvania on Ross and Dia-
mond Streets. The school publication
of WUP in the 70’s was the College
Journal, a news and editorial compil-
ation issued and edited by the stu-
dents.

Of interest to modern thinking stu-
dents is the critical expose of women)
called ‘The Sphere of Woman,” writ-
‘ten by a “prep . . whose intimate.
knowledge of the subject, gained by:
long experience and wide observation,
qualiﬁes him to speak with authority.”
The contribution appears in the Jan-
uary, 1873, number of the Journal.

The youthful critic conﬁdently
assumes that “. . . no one will deny
that the proper sphere of woman is at.
the head of her household.” He goes
on with reckless abandon: _

“The surest step toward a good day,
coming is in woman’s keeping true to
herself, and retaining the respect and:
admiration which nature has implant-"
ed in the heart of man towards her.
Let her not in seeking her true posi-
tion take a long stride beyond it and
be farther away than before she made
the effort.

“. . . the world move.» on and the
real‘ rights of woman move with it.
Fifty years ago she was conﬁned to

the schoolroom, the needle, the fac-
tory, or the kitchen . . A woman
speaking in public in those days
would have been looked upon with con-
tempt. But what a change has taken
place in this nineteenth century!
Now women are our best lecturers and
draw the largest audiences. But what
a plight will our country be in, if
women ever have the right to vote
and hold office. [How it would look
to see a woman making a stump
speech!

“I think common decency should keep
woman from ever wanting to get be-
yond her present limit. If she does
exceed it, man will have less respect
for her than at the present time.”

How shocked would C. A., the
anonymous critic of femininity, be if
he should glance at the gossip column
of the Journal’s grandson. The Pitt-
pourri column of The News has a dif-
ferent slant on feminine behavior.
These few excerpts by the unknown
Walter Winchell cast light upon the
antics and frantics of the modern W0-
man:

“Ione Williams rejected a. bid to
VVest Point over the Christmas binge
on account of a Delt . Louise
Nicholson walked off with ﬁrst hon-
ors in the initial amateur night at
the Roosevelt Hotel Gold Room . .
and Frank Frederick spends more
time with the accordion player at the
campus nite-spot than he does in
classes . . . Edna Cadugan and Tom-
my Savage, both recently commenced,
are head over heels in oblivion . . .
Dear gals: How about keeping the fel-
follows straightened out at the
dances? And G; why did you leave
your escort cold for about one-half
hour at the Frosh dance?”

Maybe It Won’t
Be By Christmas,
But It’ll Be Soon

This isn’t a Christmas story but it
may sound like one before it’s ﬁn-
ished.

The fact is that with the installa-
tion of swinging doors, wooden ﬂoors
and corps of students washing win-
dows in the Cathedral, the prospect of
a regular schedule of full morning
or afternoon College classes in the
Cathedral will be a reality by next
semester.

The class rooms will, of course, be
of unﬁnished red hollow tiles and rug-
less cement ﬂoors, but they will be
roomy, well ventilated and have plen-
ty of light. Most of the classrooms
will be on the ﬁrst and second mez-
zanine ﬂoors of the Commons Room
overlooking the vast gray pit.

But above the classrooms on the
fourth, ﬁfth and sixth ﬂwors will be
the mecca of the undergraduates, be-
ginning next year with the opening of
the library and the student lounges.
Much of the work has been ﬁnished
on the fourth and ﬁfth ﬂoors and only
the sixth ﬂoor hasn’t been completely
plastered. The stack room on the
fourth ﬂoor has been completed. A

book 'e'1‘evat'cn~'has"b'ee:i' installed that’

does all but open the page, read, and
take notes for students. A pneumatic
tube system shoots the book slips
from the main lending desk to the li-
brary pages.

Rooms for private study, typing,
and meetings adjoin the main read-
ing room. Lounges for men and wo-
men and separate lounges will be pro-
vided.

In short those facilities for which
many generations of Pitt students and
graduates have hoped will at last
be in existence. All rooms are of
clean, sweeping design, painted in
pleasant colors.

Teachers’ Group
To Hold Meeting

Lessenberry To Attend Convention
Of Commercial Education Unit

The National Commercial Teachers’
Federation, a national organization

Beta Gamma Sigma Taps-
Two Senior Women, Man

Beta Gamma Sigma, national hon-
orary Business Administration frater-
nity has tapped three seniors in the
School of Business Administration.
The three, whose names are an-
nounced today, are: Frank J. Crispen,
Martha Chartiers, and Anna M. John-
son.

Aside from honoring two women
among the three accepted into the or-
ganization, the group also awarded to
Peggy Foster, ’38, the plaque honor!
presented by the fraternity for the
outstanding student in the Business
Administration freshman class each
year.

Although Miss Foster's honor was
made public earlier in the semester,
formal engraving of her name on the
plaque in State Hall took place last
week.

Well, Well,
Delts Win Again

Before a capacity crowd, eight
lads of Delta Tau Delta retained
their strangle hold on the lnterfra-
ternity Sing title in the semi-an-
nual battle of ballads at the Hotel
Schenley, Monday evening.

Pi Kappa Alpha annexed second
honors with Phi Kappa receiving
honorable mention. Eleven frater-
nities competed for the cup. ,

Bill Schenck, chairman of the in-
formal sing and swing, presented
the first and second place trophies.

Cups to the winners of touch foot-
ball and volleyball were also pre-
sented at the affair.

Following the singing, the ball-
room was cleared to allow the large
Yuletide crowd to swing into danc-
ing. Jimmy Bray"s orchestra pro-
vided the music.

15 Here To Attend
Volunteer Session

3,000 National Delegates Expected
At Indiana Student Convention

Two days after Christmas, 15 dele-
gates from the University will crawl
into a waiting bus bound for Indian-
apolis, to atte11d the 1935-36 Student
Volunteer Movement convention. At
the same time, approximately 3,000
other college representatives will be
boarding cars, buses, trains, and
bicycles to arrive at the same desti-
nation. Every state in the Union.
and many of the provinces from
Canada will be represented. Almost
every important nation will send a
group to participate in what William
W. Mendenhall, secretary of the
YMCA, calls the “outstanding experi-
ence of four years in college.”

“A college student can have only
one opportunity for attending one of
these conventions,” he pointed out.
"They are held \once every four
years. This will be the twelfth.”

The convention will begin on De-
cember 27, and continue until the ﬁrgt,
day of the new year. Plans have
been completed to obtain prominent
Christian statesmen, and as a result
.some of the outstanding people in re-
iigious circles have been brought to

hdianapolis.
Japan, China, Canada, and the United
States.

The seminars will be the center of
the convention program. Through
them, the delegates will be given an
opportunity to consider some of the
problems that confront not only the
cities and nations, but the world.
There will be 33 seminars in all, and
they will be prepared to enroll up to
300 delegates in each.

However, Mendenhall emphasized
the fact that religion would not play
the whole role in the convention.
Plans have been made for the forma-
tion of Bach and Handel choruses, in-
formal sings, and a New Year party
which will follow the Tuesday session.
Plans have been completed for the
rendition of a play that has been suc-
cessfully produced in colleges and
churches all over the country “Opera-
tion at One.”

The ﬁnal program will be in three
main divisions: platform hours for a
sequence of addresses, special fea-
tures, and seminars.

Mendenhall announced that any in-
terested student should inquire at the
Y Hut or Heinz House for more par-
ticulars as to the program or details.

Newly Organized Bodies To Begin
Activity Soon On Proposed
Program For Year

William !Harvey, C36, chairman of
the Student-Faculty Assembly, yes-
terday appointed chairmen and co-
chairmen for 15 of the 18 committees
which S1F'A ag:'e-l to sponsor last
Tuesday.

Each chairman was asked to accept
or decline his appointment in writing,
and, if he accepted, to submit a list
of prospective committeemen to the
office. of the dean of men. »

Charles Herald, -C36,’ has accepted
the chairmanship of the forum com-
mittee, created to investigate the ne-
cessity and desirability of frequent
forums addressed by prominent speak-
eds, and if found desirable, to handle
the entire program.

To head the S-ub-Freshman Day
committee, David Racusin, BA37, has
accepted the post as chairman. The
work of his committee will be to de-
termine whether the Sub-Freshman
Day, started last spring, should be
separated from the Spring Festival
program. According to the report of
the executive committee, this group
is mainly a research committee, but
may ultimately be assigned the re-
sponsibility of organizing a High
School Day program.

A Peace Assembly to be held in the
spring is under the jurisdiction of a
committee headed by Herrymon Maur-
er, C36. This group will “determine
the interest in a Peace Assembly, and
secure speakers who will present the
question of peace in a digniﬁed and
intelligent manner.”

Alumni Magazine Features
Business Research Article

With a striking cover—a camera
study of a steel mill by «Luke Swank,
and a feature article, "Business Re-

searching in the Pittsburgh District,”
by Dr. Ralph J, Watkins, director of
the Bureau of Business Research at
the University, occupying a prominent
position inside, The Alumni Review
takes on an industrial aspect for its
November and December issue.

Dr. Watkins, in his discussion, ex-
plains the work of the Bureau, which
has been attracting attention recently
with its frequent reports on improv-
ing business conditions in the city.
Founded in 1929 by means of a special
grant to the University by the Buhl
Foundation for an eight-year program
in regional economic research, the bu-
reau was given the status of co-ordin-
ate division of the University by the
trustees, acting on the recommenda-
tion of the Chancellor, and the orig-
inal grant was supplemented by the
University. The members of its staff
are all on the faculty of the School
of Business Administration. The staff
is composed of two research staffs,
senior and junior. The senior is
made up of seven men———the director,
the assistant director, an industrial
economist, a labor economist, a ﬁnan-
cial economist, a statistician, and the
editor of the Pittsburgh Business Re-
view. The junior staff numbers nine
research and laboratory assistants,
three draftsmen, and a secretarial unit
of ﬁve persons.

The objective of the Bureau's pro-
gram, according to Dr. Watkins, is to
contribute to the solution of the econ-
omic problems confronting the Pitts-
burgh district. The remainder and
greater part of the article is taken up

by a summary of the essentials of a.
national policy for the bituminous coal
industry, taken from” a monograph re-
cently published by the Bureau. This
publication is a 200-page volume en-
titled “Regional Shifts in the Bitumin-
ous Coal Industry, with Special Refer-
ences to Pennsylvania” by Wilbert 0.
Fritz and Theodore A. Veenstra, in-
structors in ﬁnancial and statistical
research, respectively.

In decided contrast to this rather
technical topic, Frank F. Carver, di-
rector of athletic publicity at the Uni-
versity, writes about the 1935 basket-
ball situation at Pitt. He reviews the
records of former Carlson-coached
teams, gives a short biography of the
popular Dr. Carlson in his connections
with the school, and his method of
coaching his cagers. Supplementing
the review is the 1935-1936 schedule
and the roster of this winter’s aggre-
gation.

Inaugurating a new feature, which
will appear regularly in the Review,
Robert X. Graham, professor of Eng-
lish and director of the University
News Service, presents “News of the
Month,” in which he reviews the hap-
penings on the campus during Novem-
ber,

In addition, there are reviews of
Pitt’s football games with Penn State,
Fordham, Army, Nebraska, and Car-
negie Tech, the usual news of consti-
tuent organizations, alumni notes, and
general University news. There is
also a page of pictures of old alumni,
who are unidentiﬁed. Readers are
asked to assist in their identiﬁcation
if they recognize any of them.

The magazine was edited by Don
Saunders, editor of Alumni publica-
tions.

dents far from the campus before the holiday spirit
has even moderately warmed up.

That, as has been said, is a part of the past. A
glance at the columns of today ’s paper shows that
quite a few organizations on campus are going to
pick up a Christmas spirit in advance. Perhaps
the most noteworthy of these is the entertaining
of 50 children from the Soho Day Nursery by the
Social Service Committee.

To some, .this might seem an insigniﬁcant affair,
but anyone who has actually taken part in such a
deed and known the expressions of gratitude on
the part of these children must know such ges-
tures return, value-for-value, more happines than
the most gay social affair of the Yuletide season.

Transporting and entertaining 50 children takes
a lot of work and makes a heap of inconvenience
for the few people who put out their eﬁorts. But
without being falsely sentimental, we can’t

imagine that these folks will have anything but a
more merry Christmas themselves for so doing.

Students Given Tips, Trials

By Ron

As a freshman reporter a few years
ago, Ron got the depraved idea that
around this time of year
might be interested in the hitchhiking
situation. Ron followed up his theory
by a few columns of copy on the whys,
wherefores, don’ts, and musts.

That started something.

Can’t Stop Her
A Woodbury College coed who has the use of only one
hand is two weeks ahead of other students in 11. typing
class.

 

Hic, Hic, Hurrah!
At the University of Paris a course is offered in “Rare
Wines and Liquors.”
Which Are You?
Dr. L. L. Click of the University of Texas says there
are two reasons why freshmen ﬂunk out of college.
1. Either freshmen get too scared of their studies,
2. Or they don’t get scared enough, and go to sleep.

Step Forward
After participating in intercollegiate sports for more
than 50 years, Cornell University has recently appointed
its ﬁrst director of athletics. The captain of the 1904
football team accepted the position.
Not Mountaineers?
The University of West Virginia has students from 13
states and four foreign countries.

His First Case
A story now going the rounds is of a student whose
law school fees were raised from $40 to $50. He looked
at his college catalogue and his catalogue said fees were
to be $40. So he sued the college administration for the
extra $10. The law school faculty was against him but
he won the case.
Nice Distinction
University of Kentucky students were recently ad-
dressed o11 “How to Tell a College Man From the Birds
and Fishes.”

Not Bad
In a recent experiment, 28 Vassar College students
gained weight and maintained good health at a cost of
43 cents a day for food.

Advice For Touring

If it’s a blizzardy sort of day, the
advice is, ﬁrst, take a bus or train, sec-
ond, take the W'illiam Penn Highway,
Route 22. But if it’s a nice, sunshiny
sort of morning, travel on the Lincoln,
Route 30.

Sometimes it helps to give the ap-'
pearance of walking your way home.
So, if you’re stuck and standing, as
you hear a car approaching, turn your
back to it, walk a stretch, look around,
and toss out a thumb. If the car pass-
es without stopping, return to your
previous stand and repeat the process.

students

To determine the feasibility of a
stlldent post office in the Cathedral,
Louis Bearer, E37", has been appointed
to supervise the investigation.

Ruth Shapiro, C37, has been asked
to head a committee to determine the
possibility of frequent iFriday assem-
blies in which activities, faculty mem-
bers, and administrative officers par-
ticipate.

In all cases, according to the execu-
tive committee, these committees have
ﬁrst the responsibility of research and
investigation in their respective ﬁelds
to determine what action should be
taken, and then, when the course is
clear, to administer the necessary de-
tails. All administrative action must
ﬁrst be approved by the executive
committee or the Student-Faculty As-
sembly, itself.

To consider the inadequacies and
crowded nature of the present social

NYA Checks

All NYA workers are asked to call
at the Treasurer’s office today for
their November checks.

ences, Woes, Joys, and Etiquette of
Getting places and on the Thumb, is
slowly taking form. Read on, if you
dare.

Hitchhiking is fun.

Now it isn’t quite the best fun in the
world, but it is fun. Besides that, it’s
educational, delightful, sociological,
and it’s also economical.

First off, allow the author to make a
side remark, if you, as a potential
hitchhiker, are so situated as to af-
ford train, bus, or plane transporta-
tion, stifle your adventurous spirit and
give yourself a break. Freezing isn’t
fun.

But if you can’t . . . well, read on.

I can remember like it was only yes-
terday when three years ago I strug-
gled up Wilkinsburg hill with a 75-
pound suitcase just full of the adven-
turous spirit and happy as a lark. But
after two hours, with no results, even
the six layers of clothin~ ceased to be
much protection against the cold, cold
air of mid-winter.

And stuck in Halifax, Pa., a goodly
distance from Pottsville, late that eve-
ning with hands numbing and ears bit-
ing, it seemed even less fun.

‘Since then, I've written my opuses
on hitchhiking at Christmas, giving
those interested all information they
might need on successful “bumming”
only to turn sissy and ride home like
a gentleman. But this year, Ron is
going back into character, and will be
able to advise from a prospective
clearly experienced viewpoint.

If you’re heading east, as most hitch-
hikers are, travel light. That is, ship
most of your baggage ahead, and car-
ry, at the most, a small bag with
“PITT” prominently displayed. It
helps.

However, don’t make the very grave
error of really trying to walk home.
Especially if you live rather far away,

A great many of our stalwart stu-
dents have had much experience in the
noble art of hichhiking—in the sum-
mer time. There’s a difference now,
when snow ﬂurries over the roads,
windshields steam up, and the famous
Pittsburgh rivers turn solid.

If you have heavy clothes, prepare
to don them now. Wear a basketball
suit of wool, if you have one, instead
of the conventional underwear. Buy
yourself woolen socks. Put on sweat-
ers, football jerseys, leather jacket,
overcoats, and ear muffs. Also have
extra protection for the feet (that’s
where the cold takes hold).

Look well-groomed and smile, even
if your teeth are beating out the song
of the tom-toms. And beware of a dark
man in a very dilapidated car. He
picks hikers up indiscriminately as
protection against ﬂat tires. I know
him of old.

Another thing, before you accept a
ride, make sure the driver is going to
a destination within civilization’s
bounds. To be let out of a car 17 milesl
from a hot dog stand is the next thing
to a quick step into oblivion.

A few ﬁnal parting shots: display
that Pitt banner or insignia prom-
nently (after all, didn't we just clean
up Southern Cal?), wear presentable
clothing; look animated at all times;
never sit down; smile; don’t smoke os-
tentatiously; appear polite; dress
warm; travel light; and . . if you
can aﬁord it, take a train or bus. If

you can’t . . stay away from the
stop-light at Bedford’s intersection
. that's my specially reserved

stand.

Dr. Lowy Discusses New Uses Of Tear Gas
In Fighting Crime, Prison Breaks, Mob Riots

By Martin Sachnoff

The uses of tear gas in combating
crime were discussed by Dr. Alexan-
der Lowy, prof‘.-3so' of organic chem-
istry, who returned this morning from
a lecture tour of VVest Virginia, Vir-
ginia, and North Carolina, addressing
various sections of the American
Chemical Society.

Speaking on “Organic Chemicals for
Law Enforcement,” Dr. Lowy de-
scribed the historical, physical, and
chemical phases of tear gases, illus-
trating their application by camera
slides and actual equipment, including
dummy cartridges, slides, and dia-
grams. “Prison breaks and bank rob-
beries have been thwarted by an ar-
rangement of cleverly concealed tear
gas guns, which discharge automatic-
ally,” Dr. -Lowy said,

Further illustrating this principle,
he cited new developments such as
safes, money bags, and bank trucks
protected by tear gas.

Dr. Lowy also showed how oﬂicers
stopped mobs, forced rlangeroits crim-
inals from barricaded houses, and pre-

vented bank robberies. In the latter
connection, ,Dr. Lowy referred to bank
vaults and banking rooms which are

protected by gas curtains.

Delving into the more technical as-
pect of tear gas, Dr. Lowy stated that
there are three basic chemicals of
which tear gases are composed; name-

ly — chloroacetophenone, ethyl bromo-
acetate, and diphenylaminechloroar-
sine (whoa! linotyper). Application
of these chemicals renders the sub-
ject absolutely helpless in a few sec-
onds, he said, Tracing the develop-
ment of tear gases, Dr. Lowy stated
that the horrors of the poisonous gases
used in the VVorld War, showed a need
for some harmless substance, which
would have no harmful effect upon
the subject in the concentrations used
yet render him helpless. Reserach
in the ﬁelds of “lachrymators,” or
substances which cause tears to ﬂow,
led to the development of tear gases.

Continuing his address, Dr. Lowy
went on to say that te_ar gases have
been completely tested under all con-
ditions for physiological and toxic ef-

l Will Triple-ARemain Law?

Economists, Political Scientists Believe Supreme Court

Will Think Twice Or More Before Saying “No”

By Chester Harris

lHamlet’s famous soliloquy, “To be
or not to be,” is well in order with the
present trial of the Agricultural Ad-
justment Act before the United States
Supreme Court.

Sooner or later, these nine jurists
must hand down a decision concerning
the constitutionality of this act. What-
ever this decision, the results will be
the direct concern of every citizen of
the United States. For this reason
members of the University’s depart-
ments of economics and political sci.
ence were asked to give their opinions
as to the probable decision of the
court and the results which would fol-
low that decision if it were unfavora-
ble to the present administration.

That the administration would con-
tinue the program in some manner
was generally conceded by all those
questioned. However, a great many
doubted that the administration would
lose the case. Among these was Ja-
cob J_ Blair, instructor in economics,
who pointed out that the “Triple A af-
fects some 40 per cent of our popula-
tion.” He stated further “Due to the
‘public interest aspect’ of the AAA, it
may be considered as roughly similar
to the ‘public interest’ in the Gold
Clause Bill, since in the Supreme
Court decision regarding the Gold
Clause Act the question of public in-
terest weighed heavily. Due to the
same reason it seems within the realm
of possibility that the decision on the
AAA will be weighted similarly. ‘For
this reason I feel that the decision will
be favorable to the administration.”

Dr. John M. Ferguson. assistant pro-
fessor of economics, pointed out that
the Court may hesitate to interrupt
the present progress of business pick-
up and give the economic value of the
AAA precedence over its constitution-
ality. He also stated that in case the
Triple A is shelved by the Supreme
Court, he believed the administration
is prepared with cther legislation to
carry on the same program.

In line with this last statement, E.

Kingman Eberhart, instructor in econ-

School Staff Compiles
Survey“ Of W ellesley

4,000 Copies of Book To Be Distributed
In Town For Citizens’ Approval

 

The University School of Education

staff has just released a statistical
survey of the Wellesley, Massa-
chusetts, schools. The survey was

designed to aid the board of education

of the New England town in reorgan-
izing its school system.

Actual work on the survey was
done by Dr. Charles A. Prall, dean of
the School, Dr. A. M. Goldberger, Dr.
G. A. Yoakum, Dr. R. V. Young, Dr.
P. W. Hutson, Dr. G. A. Buckner, Dr.
C. D. Morneweck, and Dr, \Villiam A.
Yeager last May.

During the summer, a statistical
analysis of the ﬁnding was completed
and copy for the 147-page booklet was
prepared. Each of the eight chapters,
beginning with an analysis of operat-
ing costs of the Wellesley schools, is
ﬁlled with signiﬁcant data presented
in readable and attractive style.

Four thousand copies of the sur-
vey will be distributed shortly to the
residents of the Massachusetts town
for their information and to obtain
their reactions to the proposals.

Bizad Alumni To Hold
Christmas Fete Friday

Talks, Songs, Caroling Planned For
Program; Santa Comes Early

Members of the Business Adminis-‘f
tration Alumni Association will go}
back to their childhood days on Fri-l
day evening, when the group will hold?
an old-fashioned Christmas Party,l
scheduled to begin at 8:30 o'clock in
Room 1309, Cathedral.

The feature will be a talk by J. G.
Quick, registrar of the University.
Christmas carols will be sung by all
the guests, and J. Lloyd Mahony, di-
rector of the Downtown Division, will
also sing several selections.

Santa will distribute gifts to those
present. In addition, the usual re-
freshments will be served. The facul-
ty of the School of Business Adminis-
tration is cordially invited to join with
the members of the Association in the
celebration.

omics, declared that in case the AAA
is destroyed, some other system would
be required for correlating production
and consumption. Mr. Eberhart de-
scribed the present method as a “bus-
iness-like” way of adjusting agricul-
tural production to the requirements
of a scarcity economy.

Dr, Marion K. McKay, professor of
economics, substantiated Mr. Eber-
hart’s statement by pointing out the
f_act that “the present AAA is sup
ported whole-heartedly by farmers
who represent a pretty large segment
of the people. The administration,”
he declared, “would not allow an ad-
verse decision of the Supreme Court
to cause the abandonment of its farm
program,” and declared that “it would
ﬁnd the funds to pay the farmers from
other sources.” Dr. McKay did not de-
ﬁne what he meant by “other sources.”

Dr. Francis D, Tyson, professor of
economics, suggested, “Should the
Court outlaw the processing taxes be-
cause it ﬁnds them to be for general
rather than for revenue purposes, a
measure could be introduced to reim-
pose the taxes through the revenue
system, severing the present direct
relation to the crop control program.
Contract beneﬁts would so be made
legal by a bill authorizing payments to
the farmers from treasury funds.”

Dr. James C. Charlesworth, associ-
ate professor of political science, in
referring to the question, stated “Soon-
er or later, the amendment of the
United States Constitution to permit
social legislation by Congress will be
an issue to be determined by the vot-
ers at the polls. An adverse action of
the Supreme Court in the case of the
AAA would serve to hasten the refer-
ence of that question to the voters.”

Russell A. Dixon, instructor in eco-
nomics, thought that the judgment of
the AAA should not be considered
apart from its social setting, “An act,”
he stated, “should be considered not ac-
cording to the constitutionality, but
with regard to how well it accom-
plishes its purpose and whether that
purpose is socially important.”

Coach’s Father Dies

Henry Zehfuss, 73, father of Dr.
Paul E. Zehfuss, assistant director

the Mount Lebanon cemetery.

Mr. Zehfuss, a former building con-
tractor, died last Friday in the Zeb-
tuss home at 58 Greenbush Street,
Mount Washington.

fects, These tests have conclusively
proved that tear gases are harmless
except to cause a ﬂow of tears, and
thus render the subject helpless in a
very short time.

In addition to his addresses, he
was entertained by members of the
American Chemical Society at din-
ners, and was shown points of inter-
est in the various towns which he vis-

,ited. At Charleston, VV. Va., he saw

industrial chemical plants for the
manufacture of synthetic ammonia;
synthetic methanol, and the higher
alcohols; synthetic urea, which is a
relatively new development; and in
addition viewed an old salt recov-
ery plant.

At Fredricksburg, Va., Dr. Lowy
visited a new industrial plant for the
production of cellophane.

Schricker Plans
Holiday Practices

 

Boxers Point For Syracuse Match,
Opener Of Panther Mitt Season

“All boxers must be present for
practices during the Christmas re-
cess,” states Coach Jack Schricker.

The squad is now pointing with se-
rious intent for the ﬁrst match with
Syracuse on January 18, which will
start the ball rolling for the boxing
team. A strict training schedule will
be religiously adhered to during these
training sessions. The ﬁrst part of
the week will be spent in calisthenics,
and the latter part in strenuous box-
ing matches.

Schricker is issuing his last call
for any varsity boxing candidates,
especia.lly those who weigh around
165 pounds. The squad at the pres-
ent time is short on ﬁghters in this
weight division.

When the football men get back
from California, the squad will be en-
larged by the addition of Frank Pat-
rick, Ted Schmidt, Tony Matisi, Cleon
Linderman, and George Musulin.
Other possible members are Gene
Stoughton and Mike Sivak.

Varsity Cagers Leave Friday
For Extended Southern Trip

Passers To Meet Xavier, Kentucky, Vanderbilt, Tulane,
And Louisiana State During Vacation Period

Just when most students will be wondering what color of tie the
gal friend is going to spring on them this Christmas, Dr. Carlson and
ten of his varsity cagers will be pulling out of Pittsburgh on a
southern tour that has the Panthers meeting ﬁve teams in six games.

Leaving here this Friday, the Panthers make their ﬁrst stop
over in Cincinnati, where they will face the Xavier ﬁve Saturday
night. It ’s the ﬁrst time a Panther ﬁve has met Xavier on the floor

since away back.

-Immediately after this game the
Panthers pack and move to Lexing-
ton, Kentucky, for a game with the
Kentucky University Colonels, Mon-
day night, December 23. Dr. Carlson
and the boys then resume the jour-
ney, traveling next to Nashville,
Tennessee, where Vanderbilt will be
played the day after Christmas.

Two days later the Panther squad
will be found way down yonder in
New Orleans, where the cagers begin
a three-game series. Tulane’s Green
Wave will be met twice, the ﬁrst game
December 28, the second three days
later, on the last day of the year.

And then comes the climax and re-
venge game of the trip! Louisiana
State’s Tiger cage team will beplayed
January 2' in a game that is one of
the highlights of the New Orleans
Mid-winter Sports Carnival, second
only to the Louisiana State-Texas
Christian football battle in the Sugar
Bowl game.

The players making the trip will
probably be the same ten that return
today from the western tour. There
will be Captain Ted Roderick, Pete
Noon, Bill Jesko, Joe Garcia, Ed Spot-
ovitch, R_ags Radvansky, Miles Ze1ez-
nick, Bob Johnson,’ Frank Loucks,
and Luke Rowe. The squad will re-
turn to Pittsburgh immediately after
the LSU game.

Panthers Take Butler

The Panthers made it two in a
row and two out of three on the mid-
western trip by stopping Butler Uni-
versity’s quintet, 36-28, at Indianap-
olis Monday night.

Led by sophomore Rags Radvansky,
the Carlson cagers ran up a sizeable
lead during the ﬁrst half and managed
to hold it in the face of a second half
sortie, generaled by Batts, Butler’s
high-scoring forward.

After hopping off to a 2-0 lead, the
Butler passers fell before an aval-
anche of Panther ﬁeld goals, of which
Radvansky and Pete Noon counted the
most on fast-breaking plays under the
basket.

With the score standing 17-10, Dr.
Carlson began revising his lineup, get-
ting in the entire second team before
the half ended. Johnson, Bill Jesko,
and Eddie Spotovich continued the
ﬁeld goal parade to give Pitt a 23-14
lead at the half. ‘

Soon after the second period began,
the air was ﬁlled with flying Batts
and shots which Batts sent streaming
through the Pitt basket. With 15
minutes left to play, the Panthers’
lead was cut to 25-23, but here Carlson
sent in fresh men to take off the
heat

Bats, with 16 points, was high
scorer of'the evening, followed by
Radvansky with 11 and Ted Roderick
with seven points.

Panther Trackers
Point For Berlin

Several Stars Rated Good Bets;
Open Season On January 18

Coach Olson’s Olympic-minded track
team promises to be another organ-
ization that will ignore the Christmas
recess, since daily drills are scheduled
for the track house on all week-days
with the exception of Christmas Day.
_ As the last day of the school year
of 1935 comes around, the trackmen

‘particularly look forward to 1936 and

the Olympic games at Berlin, Ger-
many, with no little concern. Several

Panthers right _ now are considered
good bets for the American entry at
even this early date.

iOlson’s entire squad opens alengthy
campaign on January 18' in the track
house, when the AAU meet brings to-
gether the outstanding track perform-
ers in the Allegheny Mountain dis-
trict. .

Following this, on the ﬁrst day of
February, the University quarter-
milers get their ﬁrst taste of national
competition when the mile-relay team
performs in the Millrose Invitation
games at Madison Square Garden.

This proves to be only the begin-
ning of a long series of national
track events. The Senior AAU cham-
pionships come up on February 22.
On March 7, the Central Intercolle-
giate Conference meet’ attracts the
Pitt runners to South Bend, Indiana.
Then follow the Armour Tech and
Butler relays, one week apart.

Varsity candidates for the 100 and
220'-yard dashes include: Menaker,
Mason, Spitz, Thomas, Wood, and
Brown. In the quarter-mile are Groat,
Thomas, McConnell, McMunn, Con-
nelly, Menaker, and Leggin.

Groat, McConnell, Connelly, Leggin,
Tost, Theriault, and Rauck compete
in the half-mile, Those working out
for the mile include Tost, Theriault,
Musico, Cook, Emens, Follette,
Vvalmsley, Leggin, and I.-oncher. This
group also performs in the two-mile
grind.

Olson has Sowiski, Lasky, Good,
and Brown for the low and high-
hurdle events. The high jumpers in-
clude Bennett, Oden, Brown, Good,
and Taano. Good, Brown, Bennett,
Menaker, Gerrety, and Mason vie in
the broad jump.

In the shot, Matisi, on his return
from the coast, will join Taano,
Avizienis, Bennett, and Kadashov.
The discus and hammer events also
show Matisi, in addition to Fassinger,
Avizienis, Harris, and Kadashov. Ben-

nett, Tost, and Lasky are other discus

tossers.

Third Invitation
Swimming Meet

Comes 01?” Tonight

This evening at Trees pool, Coach
Pat Corr, varsity swimming head,
will hold the third Vvednesday even-
ing district invitational meet.

Boys under 12 will get a chance to
show their stuff in an 80-yard free-
style relay race, each lad swimming
one length of the pool. Teams com-
posed of boys ranging from 12 to 16
years in age will engage in a 160-
yard relay. In the ﬁnal event of the.
program, all natators over the 16-year
mark will participate in an open free-
style race.

The past two of these carnivals
have had more than passing success,
and Coach Corr hopes that this one
will top them all. Through these in-
vitations, Corr hopes to create an in-
terest among swimming enthusiasts
for the water sport in the Western
Pennsylvania area.

Varsity and yearling swimmers
have been working out now for about
two months and are rapidly nearing
top form. Among the varsity men
who have been doing well are Russ
Lindberg and Tom Locke. In the
group of frosh splashers, Walt No-
vatny and Hal Neff in freestyle
events, and Bill Bron and Steve Rod-
nok in the diving event, have been
performing in ﬁne fashion.

During the holiday season the swim-
mers will make their headquarters at
the Metropolitan pool, downtown.
Practices will be held both in the aft-
ernoon and evening, the latter ses-
sions coming only on Monday, Wed-
nesday, and Friday evenings, but the
afternoon ones, daily except Sunday.

Sight-Seeing Trip Through West
Follows Win Over Trojans

Thirty-three varsity gridders will
arrive in Pittsburgh Friday evening
at 6:30 o’clock, bearing not only the
eﬂigy of a Trojan horse but an in-
teresting sight-seeing experience as
well. A Newman travelogue has
nothing on the places the victorious
football team visited on the road
home.

After the ball game last Saturday,
the team was feted at the celebrated
Cocoanut Grove, where only the best
of the celebrities dance and dine.
Sunday and part of Monday were de-
voted to touring the interesting spots
in the southern part of California,
and yesterday the tourists gazed upon
Mother Nature’s wonder spot, the
Grand Canyon,

A visit to the Indian villages and
prehistoric remains at Sante Fe, New
Mexico, was on today’s schedule.

The victory over Southern Califor-
nia wound up another successful sea-
son for the Pitt football forces, which
saw victories over Waynesburg, West
Virginia, W&J, Penn State, Nebraska,
Army, and Southern California, ties
with Fordham, and Tech, and a loss
to Notre Dame recorded.

According to a majority of recog
nized sport critics, the 1935 eleven
rates among the ten leading teams in
the country for the season.

‘Saturday’s encounter marked the
ﬁnal collegiate game for Captain Nick
Kliskey, Hub Randour, Art Detzel,
Leon Shedlosky, Vin Sites, Marwood
Stark, Jim Scarfpin, and Len Rector.

Song, Stunt Night

Greek Body Limits Skits To Eight
Participants, With Five Minute
Fraternity Presentations

Panhellenic Council is making plans
for its combined sing and stunt night
in which fraternity women will vie for
vocal honors, The Interfraternity
Sing is scheduled for Thursday eve-
ning. January 16, at 7:30 o'clock. F

Chairman Esther Levinson, Ed3I.
who is making plans for the annual
event, suggests that each women’s f_ra-
ternity select a sing chairman for its
individual group.

The women’s sing differs from the
men’s in that an original skit or stunt
usually accompanies the songs and
helps to carry out the theme» of the
musical numbers.

The number of Women participating
in the contest from each group_is
limited to eight, and the accompanist,
who is not included in the chosen
eight, may be either an alumna or an
active of the fraternity. .

No more than ﬁve minutes will be
allotted to the groups entered in
the sing.

Work on this year’s edition of “O
Philos,” Panhellenic handbook, has be-
gun under the direction of Ruth L_a-
zirovitz, C36, chairman of the public-
ity committee. Esther Levinson,
Ed37, Grace Atkinson, Ed37, and Mar-
garet Murphy, C37, are included on
the committee preparing the hand-

book for publication before spring
rushing. _

Time of meeting of Panhellenic
Council has been changed to 4

o’clock Thursday afternoons. As
usual, meetings will be held at Heinz
House.

50 Soho Children

To Receive Toys
At Annual Party

Today, in a typical Christmas at-
mosphere, the Social Service Commit-
tee of YVVCA, with the cooperation of
YMCA will have as guests to their
annual Christmas party at Heinz
House 50 children from the Soho Day
Nursery.

A special program consisting of
Christmas games and a Christmas
story, told by Ruth Sharpe, Ed37, has
been planned. Each child will receive
a red and green stocking ﬁlled with
nuts, candy, and fruits of all sorts.
The climax of the party will be
reached with the arrival of Santa
Claus with his bag ﬁlled with toys,
in many cases the only ones that
most of the children will receive for
Christmas.

The people responsible for the
Christmas entertainment are: Adolph
Bender, C37, who will be Santa Claus;
Mr. George Connelly, clerk in the tool
room of the Cathedral, who supplies
the transportation; Erskine Manter-
ﬁeld, C38, in charge of the men’s com-
mittee; and the Social Service com-
mittee.

Plan Mothers’ Tea

class are planning for the class’s an-
nual Mothers’ Tea, to take place at

tion of Ann Townsend, C38, to the po-
sition of activities chairman for the
class.

Students Prepare Schedule
For 1.9-Day Holiday Binge

Christmas vacation starts sometime
today, depending upon when your last
class ends or how many classes you
cut. Inasmuch as you should have 61
days in classes and 27 holidays (Sat-
urdays and Sundays included) up un-
til this time, you will probably welo
come the unusually long Christmas re-
cess of 19 days.

From a survey taken around cam-
pus, this holiday is going to be spent
by students in such diverse places as
Canada, Florida, and the Carnegie Li-
brary. While some of the more for-
tunate ones are seeing things, others
will be giving the home town a
break. Nevertheless it would be nice
to be able to say as Charles Allcroft,
C36, “the onions didn’t taste much
better in Bermuda than they do here."

Ruth Mills, C37, will visit Youngs-
town ; Ruth Anderson, Ed36, will visit
Geneva College, and Sally Harris, C36,
will vacation in Tennessee. Alice
Hirsch, C39, and Sally Brunson, C38,
who will see the sights in New York,
will probably run across Bob Mad-
den, C37, Harvey Goldstein, C37, and
David Racusin, C37, who will also be
in New York for sundry reasons.

Ben Baskin, BA37, will spend the
greater part of his vacation in St.
Louis at a fraternity convention.
Others, as Charles B. (Holstein, C36,
Roberta Nern, Ed36, Thyrsa A. Amos,
C38, Neff Wells, C38, and Charles
Demmitt, C39, will visit their home
towns.

Of those remaining in town, Anne

June Elmer, C36, will work on the
Owl; Russ Connolly, C36, will spend
the greater part of his time at the li-
brary working on back work, with
just the usual line of Christmas par-
ties as a diversion. Ralph Appel,
BA36, George Strong, C36, and Harry
Rob/inson, C36, will study, while
Charles Ebert, C36, Sidney Tumpson,
BA39, and Morton Robins, C38, work
at various downtown department
stores.

Others have more unusual tastes.
Madeline Batty, Ed37, will work at
dancing; Fred Kelly, C38, will teach
tap dancing; Al Treusch, C38, will
practice on his trumpet; Dick Brenne-
man will visit Harrisburg; Irene Long
will trek to Canada to take in a. ‘bit
of skiing.

Members Of Kappa Phi
Exchange Gifts At Party

Yesterday afternoon Kappa Phi,
Methodist wonien’s fraternity, held a
Christmas party at the Christ Church.
Before supper, gifts brought by the
girls were exchanged. The favors,
pine cones with red candles, were
brought home this summer from the
national convention at Bemidji, Min-
nesota, by the local delegation.

Program chairman was Frances
Diindore, C38. Geraldine Dravo, C38,
directed the musical pageant.

Doctors To Hear
Women Debaters

On Medical Topic

On .Ianuary 5 at 8 o’cl. ck, the W0-
men’s Debating Association of the
University will debate before the
American Medical Association of Al-
legheny County at the Schenley Hotel.
The question will be: Resolved, that
the several states should enact legisla-
lation providing for a system of com-
plete medical care available for all at
public expense.

On the affirmative team will be
Marcella Leyton, C37, and Betty Doug-
las, C37. Ruth Friedberg, Ed36, and
Dolly Kiedaisch, C38, will uphold the
negative.

Yesterday, women debaters of the
University participated in an Oregon
debate before the Junior Junta and
Franklin Debating Club of Schenley
High School. Upholding the affirma-
tive were Jeannette Schwartz, C38,
and Gertrude Reich, C36. On the neg-
ative side were Sara Reish, C36, and
Dolly Kiedaisch, C38. Misses Reish
and Reich did the crossquestioning.

Student Positions

Students who are experienced as
meat cutters or clerks should report
immediately at the employment bu-
reau in Room 801, Cathedral.

The bureau also has an opening for
students who drive each day from
Bellevue and return late in the aft-
ernoon. If they desire passengers,-
they should contact the employment
office today.

Swedish To Hold
Traditional Feast

‘ ‘ Smorgasbord’ ’ Lantern Talk
Will Raise Funds For Room

A traditional Swedish affair, the
“Smorgasbord,” will feature the
Christmas celebration of the Swedish
Nationality Room Committee for the
Cathedral Saturday evening, Decem-
ber 21, at 8 o'clock on the thirteenth
ﬂoor of the Cathedral.

The “Smorgasbo1d” is familiar to
every Swedish family and is like an
American buffet supper. In the Ca-
thedral, long tables will hold such
things as kerv sausage, potato salad,
a variety of meats and breads, and
cake and coffee. Traditionally, the
“Smorgasbord” is followed by a five-
course dinner, but this phase will
not be part of the Saturday night af-
fair.

Before the “Smorgasbord” is served,
a lantern-slide talk on the Antarctic
will be given by Finn Romme, who
was a member of Admiral Richard
Byrd’s second Antarctic Expedition.

Proceeds from the celebration, of
which Mrs. Hugo Kahl is chairman,
will go toward the Nationality Room
fund. Students and faculty members
may procure tickets for the “Smor-

gasbord” in Mrs. Mitcliell’s office,
Room 1309, Cathedral. The price of
tickets is one dollar.
