On Hoeveler Amendment
Pre-Mods Take

New Constitution
Measures Hint
, At Consideration.

'Po'ssi‘bilit_v that the “Hoevele-r”
aniendnient” will _be included‘
with the general revisions of they
SFA 1 constitution was indicated

today by David Tuck_er,_ C41,
chairman of the constitutional
revision coininittee,

Reserving comment on the
subject because the committee will
not meet until tomorrow, Tucker

explained that the group ..would.

welcome suggestions. from students
about the present student, govern-
ment setup because “the changes

made will mean something to every.

student.”

The amendment or “purity mo-
tion,” as it"was called, provided for
the election of officers by the ex-
ecutive committee rather than by
the assembly. It was “killed” be-
cause the new assembly, affected
most by the change, would not have
opportunity to judge its merits.
Original Intention

Originally designed to “take
caucus politics out of the election
of SFA officers,” the amendment fell
short of adoption by a few votes.

Present members of the SFA as-
semblv who Voted against i.t are
Rae Young, BA41, Phi Delta Theta;
Gene Pyle, C41, Kappa Kappa Gam-
ma: Joe Roberts, BA41, Phi Gamma
Delta, president; Mary Lewis, C41,
Kappa Alpha Theta; Dave Buente,
C41, Delta Tau Delta, and Dorothy
Ann Carrier. C41, Independent.

Young and Nancy Digby, former
secretary of the assembly. reversed
their favorable decision which had
been made when the amendment
went before a study committee.

Amos Advises Changes

Suggestion for a committee to
study the constitution and purpose

possible revisions was advanced by

Miss Thyrsa W. Amos, dean “of
women, who stated, “there are a
number of things about the consti-
tution which should be changed and
they might as well all be done at
once.”

Heading the committee as estab-
lished by the former assembly
members was Lewis Riley. C42,
who, upon failing to return this se-
mester, was replaced by Tucker.

Included on the committee with
Tucker are Dr. Lanfear; Thyrsa W.
Amos, dean of women; Roy H.
Umble, instructor in speech; Vir-
ginia Halen, C41: Bill McElwain,
C41; Rae Young, BA41, and Harriet
Harris, C42.

Today . . .

is the last day to sign up for hospi-
talization, Dr. H. C. Carlson, direc-
tor of the Men’s Student Health
::e1~vi.ce, announces. After today the
plan is closed until the second so-
mester. The fee of $2.50 is payable
at the treasurers ofﬁce in State hall.

Players’ New Technical Head
Defends Work Behind Scenes

“The director may create the lily,
but we gil.d it.”

Thus Frank Mason, recently—ap-
pointed techincal head of Pitt Play-
ers, defended the under-cover work
of a college technical crew. Ex-

plaining that the “people behind the‘

scenes are seldom seen or heard,
and therefore not appreciated,” Mr.
Mason, who succeeds James ‘Lind-
say as Players’ technical director,
went on to state that he had been
in the business for more than ten
years, and that “there’s nothing like
it.”

Formerly a student at Carnegie
Tech drama school, which he at-
tended for three years, Mr. Mason
paid for the privilege of getting his
face‘ dusty, his hands covered with
paint, and his trouser legs “sawed
off.” He was surprised to ﬁnd that
such thrills were free to University

E students at the technical shop.

After leaving Tech, the new di-
rector, known as “Ted” to his
friends, worked as a cigarette sales-
man, but felt the call of the theater
and organized his famous marion-
eite show. The show grew lrom a
stock story with a few puppets
which he was glad to show at 
neighborhood school to a repertoire
of six plays from the fairy tale to
the classics, which now tour Penn-
sylvania in four road snows. Church-
es, clubs and department stores
have employed Mason marionettes.
He is now at work on the produc-
tion of Victor Herbert’s “Babes in
Toyland” in his puppet laboratory.”

A charter member of the “Pup-
peteers of America,” he explained

that his work this year at the Uni-
versity will force him to stay in one
place longer than he has ever been
in his professional life. Previously
he was a free-lancer,
shows for high school and amateur
theater groups in western Pennsyl-

‘Vania.

His extensive work in miniature
will help in the building of stage
sets for the Player productions this
year. He makes use of the plan of
first building miniature sets, con-
structed to scale and accurate in
every detail, and then enlarging
them to the proportions of the stage.
“It is easier to correct errors when
they occur in miniature,” he ex-
plained.

At present he is designing» sets for
“My _1-Ieart’s in the Highlands”
which the technical crew will build
under the direction of Joe Deily,
C41, technical manager.

‘Youth in Politics’
And Modern Democracy

We are pleased to note the activities on campus of the Roose-
velt and Willkie College clubs.

Historians agree upon one point: that in stable times the na-
ttiou is ruled by the older, more conservative element; and that in
dynamic times, in times of stress and change, it is the young men
_\vii,O.'.,,i!,’I‘.€,,.'tII,1e guiding factor.

These are times of st'rain. VVe believe that we under-21’s,
we wlio cannot directly affect but who can be affected, must more
than compeiisate for our inability to vote.

2 ‘ilemocracy, it has been proven, is not merely rule of the ma-
joirity. It is the rule of experts and authorities. These, while
their principles of government may coincide with those of the
inajomty, are far more capable, in themselves, of administering
those‘ principles than are the masses as a whole.

Tillie must believe that. If we do not, we must‘ return to the
idea of the old town meeting, with some seventy million people
._st2'uIding in squares throughout the nation and signifying their
laipproval. of each legislative measure by a raising of the hand.
Under such a. system, we might reasonably expect‘, over a period
of,-‘say, twenty years, to enact three or four bills pertaining to the
trea‘=.n1e1'It of milch cows at the hands of the tenant farmer, "or
siiiiilaiily lSlgI1lﬁC2ll‘lt legislation.

Democracy, moreover, does not stop at the polls. In fact we
con:-tidcr the process of voting merely as a gesture, a symbol of the
mcchanisins of democracy.

‘We must combine somet.hi.ng between the relative permanence
of our own four year system. and the vote of conﬁdence system of
.1’)I‘.(,“»i‘Y:xl.:l.}: continental. democracies.

We extend our congratulations to leaders Boies and Roth, mean-
while remindi.ng them that student demonstrations and cainpaign
lIllli.(II"IS are grand for the stimulation of student interest, but are
not I::alcuIate(.I in the election returns. The electoral college still
p.zi_ys off on votes.

A “’ord of Praise
Eor the Town Meeting

Pitt Town Meeting received an additional boost. last Montlay in
Louis ‘W. H. J ohnst.on’s expert discussion. of the presidential cam-
paign.

Boldly eliminating the emotional, prejudicial, popular miscon-
ception of the issues, Mr. Johnston rationally and directly placed the
real issues of the campaign on  plane consistent with the University
st11d».:-nts’ manner of discussing and understanding popular, every-
day problems.

Wi'th the newspapers, the radio, and the platform ﬁlled with
pa'rtis:a.n hysteria, a scientiﬁc discussion of national politics is a wel-
comed antedote for students suffering from “poI0t’ick:;.”

>)l< >I€ 

Besides presenting a dynamic speakciz l\loiIda_\f Town .Vl£‘t".l'Ill,L“
set :1 precedent in attendance for the year. A.cc<)i?di.1Ig to plans of
the forum committee, Monda_v’s session was to be the first of tlircc
liigh-powered m.ee.tings mapped out for the week.

_V iiudttliittlllletlwftll‘ today’s forum was Pierre Cot, former Front-Ii
‘Il'lllIVl.'~I‘i'.f;*.l‘ of the interior, whose last-minute illness prevents him from
spcalciiig this afternoon, but who deﬁnitely promises to make an ap-
‘.pea.rancc sometime this year.

.. i"T_l’l€ Town Mcctin.g committee lit-londay was also dickeriug for 2.1
special program for this Friday which would have presented a Re-
publi.ca.nI,2 a‘De1nocrat, and the Socialist candidates for the presi(lency
in  symposium on the present political campaign.

Had all the plans materialized this week, the Pitt campus would
have seen the most gala forum program assembled here for years.

"For this we congratulate the Pitt Town Mcetviiig committee and
trust that they are able to keep up the good work.

“RIelentlessly and brutally, the

the lowly irosh establishing ‘bloody
Mondays’ with street ﬁghting, black
eyes and broken heads. Spartan-
like and stamped with the stoic
creed of the Reformation period, the
victims accepted their barbaric
fate. I

“In Spain the freshman student
had to be a toreador. He was coin-
pelled to ﬁght at least ﬁve bulls and
top it off with a feast of five courses,
at which the nation’s king was honor
guest. Or he clad himself in one
piece of iron suits, marched his ten
paces and duelled for his acceptance
status—and for his life.”

My Dear John:

Like Quisling of Norway and
Corap of France, you have turned
traitor to the interests you swore
to uphold. Your blustering endorse-
ment of Wendell Willkie, and your
bulldog snarls at President Roose-
velt will take ﬁrst rank as the most
disgraceful and treacherous act

committed in the annals of organ-‘

ized labor.

No man in his right mind, John,
could have honestly performed your
crime without emotional aberration
and a completely demoralized spirit.
I didn’t envy you when you pro-
nounced your deceitful accusations
against our President. You must
have suffered qualms of conscience
and mental anguish quite sufficient
to break down the self-respect of
the most hardened character.

A Strange Camp

No wonder. John; 1 your speech.

was cloaked in utter secrecy! No
wonder you closeted yourself in
your inner offices, and hid your
face from the newsmen as well as
your fellow labor leaders! How,
John. could you look humanity in
the face when you joined the cara-
van of exploiters, strike—breakers,
and labor baite1's——-the men who
despised you and fought you in the
days when you and Franklin Roose-
velt struggled gallantly to improve
the lot of labor. You ﬁnd yourself
now in a strange camp indeed, ac-
cepted with mental reservations and
secret convulsions. You will re-
ceive a “hearty” welcome from
hypocrites and sycophants. Finan-
ciers and captains of industry will
happily accept another recruit in
their hate-Roosevelt crusade. if only
because thereby thev can “prove”
that even “organized labor” supports
their utility candidate.

The Old Gang

You have chosen the easy way
to win social recognition, John.
Now you can sup with the high and
mighty and take on an air of “re-
spectability” and class. But I chal-
lenge you—I dare you. John-—to
walk the alley ways and crowded
streets where your millions of la-
borers live and work. I dare you
to enter the textile plants where
thousands of girls toil at the looms,
or the steel mills and coal mines
where sweating men swing the pick
and shovel. For these millions of
men and women cling to the hero
you have scandalously attacked.

These millions of men and women
have a more abiding sense of grati-
tude. They know that President
Roosevelt has won for himself abuse
and incessant denunciation because
he dared to ﬁght for the common
man. They have experienced the
beneﬁts of the wage and hours law,
the National Labor Relations board,
Social Se<.-urity. Federal housing——
the mounting crescendo of victories
won for labor under President

Roosevelt. These men and women,
John, are not blind. They can see
how industrialists have ganged up
to defeat him at any cost. They can
see an unscrupulous and frantic
press seeking to create a last min-
ute stampede of fear to oust the
greatest liberal of the modern
world.
Split for Tat

You have become an embittered
old man, John. Simply because you
nurse a personal grudge, you are
willing to split labor asunder, and
bring ruin to the four million work-
ers in your union. This inhuman
and callous disregard of your mem-
bership’s interest has at last iden-
tified your true character. Your
ingratitude to the President, for
having paved the way for union-
ization by section 7—A and the
NLRB,‘ for having compelled the
coal operators to sign a closed-shop
agreement '* with" your union; for .
having protected miners with strin-
gent safety laws and better hous-
ing, marks you as labor’s most
spiteful enemy.

When you were a friend to labor, »
I admired you for your ﬁghting
spirit. I, with millions of other
Americans, saw in you an instru-
ment to effect a higher standard of
living for impoverished labor. I But
now, when you Spurn the leader-.
ship of the man who saved America
in 1933 and raised labor from its
desperate condition, I and the mil-
lions of other Americans will dis-
own and repudiate you. We will.
remember you as the ﬁghting John,
who fought for labor, and we shall
try to forget your recent treachery
and dishonor. And, meanwhile, the
millions in your ranks will rededi-
Cate themselves to the crusade be-
gun in 1933, and with Franklin
Roosevelt will continue to build a
happier and more prosperous Amer-
ica.

Sincerely yours,
GERALD ZISKIND.

Out Oil & Gas Seven, 6-2

Sparked once again by the bril-

_l.?ant play of Joe Wilk and Fred K

Evans, the Chem E Juniors d.et‘eat-ed
the Oil&Gass-ers 6-2 in a bitterly
iought contest last Monday.

The Chem E's scored as soon as
play got underway on a pass into
the uat from Evans to Wilk. The
conversion failed and the score read,
6-0.

There was no further scoring ex-
cept for a safety for the Oil&Gassers
when they trapped Wilk behind his
own goal line as he chased a bad
pass from center.

Earlier in the day WWW swam_ped
the YMCA seven, 31-13, in a fast
and free-scoring game.

Starting: off last, never to be head-
ed, Ed Cowden and Johnny Masto-
vich combined on an air attack to

score a touchdown and add the extra '

point the sar e way to send the
‘WWW’s into the lead, 7-0.

A few plays later Andy Johnson
scored on a beautiful run as he re-
turned a YMCA punt to drive the
score to 13-0. The conversion
failed. ,

Not to be outdone, the Y boys
quickly put on an “air raid” of their
own and scored when Jack Kelly
took Denny Trettel’s long pass. Hen-
ry Grance rnaclo the score 13-7 with
his dropliick conversion.

Cowden again took to the air and
*..‘nrew a long pass to Larry Tregon-
ing in the end zone to make the
score 19-7, as the half ended.

The second half had just begun
when Johnson threw one to Cowden
vvho outran the opposition and made
the score 25-7’. The conversion Jail-
-ed as did all the rest.

a pass and again he connected, this
time to George Kline, to make it
25-13. ’ '

The fmal score of the’ game came
in the dying moments of the half as
the Cowden to Johnson combination
clicked again.

An Electrical B team, composed
mostly of unknowns, upset a veteran
Civil Engineering team, 6-0, in their
first game of the season Monday.

The only score of the game was
set up after‘ Kramer kicked from
behind his own goal line to mid-
field. On the first play Preininger
lateraled far across the ﬁeld to
Bruce, who returned the pass to
Preininger for 15 yards. Bruce then
passed to Stiebel, who was downed
on the two.

The lone tally came on fourth
down when Bruce shovel passed to
Orloff. The try for point failed and
the game ended, when Stiebel leaped
high into the air to intercept Kra-
mer’s pass.

In the last game the Golden
Bears elirninated a gallant Political

With Jayvees
This Saturday

Kliskey Team Geared
To Upset Reserves

Saturday is the day of reckoning
for Pitt’s freshman football hope-
fuls. Seasoned by a month of in-
tensivc drilling, a half dozen scrim-
mages, and one intra-squad game,
the freshmen meet their most im-
portant test so far in a battle with
Pitt’s junior varsity, scheduled ior
the Stadium Saturday afternoon at
2 o’clock.

This game should provide a prov-
ing ground for ambitious gridders
on both the junior varsity and
freshman squads. The B squad
boys, bouncing back from a tough
7-6 loss to the Navy reserves, are
determined to salvage a little glory
out of this season by. tamingthe up-
start freshmen. But the fresh are

aiming at future varsity berths, and, .

bolstered‘ by Coach .Nick; Kliskeyfs
opinion" that they looked “pretty
good” in last Friday’s civil war, will
be hard to handle.

All Freshmen to Play

Kliskey promises to use nearly
everyone on the freshman squad.
Though no ﬁrst team has yet been
chosen, the two starting lineups in
Friday’s game will probably pro-
vide the starters in the junior var-
sity battle. The Smith to Gestner
passing combination which clicked
for the only score in the intra-squad
game will be a big‘ freshman threat.
Triple-threat. Eddienskladany is an-
other big gun who may help the
Panther cubs spoil the fun for com-
edian Bill Fitchko and his “Milk
Squad” mates.

In the front trenches, the fresh-
men have no worries with bruisers
like I_.al\/lonaca, Salvucci, and Rose-
pink leading the charge into the
enemy backﬁeld. And Clawes and
McAlee-se are both able pivot men
and vicious line-backers.

B Team Conﬁdent

The B team, of course, expects to
win. Some of the boys are even a
little cockvey, and their arguments
would be absolutely convincing were
it not for the exceptional ability of
the 1940 freshmen. At Navy last
Friday, the starting Pitt backﬁeld
showed Frldley, Saksa, Dutton, a.nd
Malloy, four young men who would
be hard to keep off many college
varsities.

Walt Fridley is a three—year vet-
eran of the key junior varsity post.
As quarterback on the team that
regularly acts as sparring partner
for the varsity, Fridley has gained
a wealth of experience, a few hard
knocks, and a ﬁne reputation with
all who stop to think of the sacri-
lices “Milk Squad” boys make for
the school and the team.

Saksa, Dutton, and Malloy are
third team performers whose sen-
tence to the “Milk Squad” was only
a temporary arrangement designed
to give the reserves a stronger team
for their games with Navy and
Penn State.

/‘win. Tettrel of the Y let loose

The Sports Staﬂ Speaks

by Ben Foote

in past years, with the advent of November,
Pitt football tcaiiis polled the bulk of ﬁrst place
votes in 99 per (ii-nut" of the nation’s football polls.
The niciiilmrs of t.l‘u= numl>cr one team in the na-
tion were well known to Pitt students, most of
them classmates in polly sci or history classes.
A number one power still comes from the East,
but now (,‘ornell instead of Pitt holds that number
one post.

Just what (loos the llig lit.-(l have in the \my
of football talent‘? The meteoric rise of the
Itliacans to an u1':bcz‘-.teu season in 1939 after the
graduation of an all-senior team the preceding
June was one of the most surprising developments
of the 1939 campaign.‘ Continuiiig where they
left off at the cud of the 1939 campaign, the rolling
Ivy L£‘2lg11(‘rs a.(fl<:lcd the sixteenth game to an un-
beaten sti-in;: in trouucing Ohio State last Sat-
urday.

To Carl Snavely, the astute head of the Cornell.
coaching staff, must? go a great deal of credit for
the showing of this two-year untied and unde-
feated squad.

Smwely Shapes W imzer

Snavely fashioned his present winning com-
bination from a ,<_»*roup of unheralded junior
reserves left over from the great 1938 brigade.
A tremendous task coint’v.'ontc(l Snavely. He sliiiftcd
a few men aroiiml. added a few more tricks to his
repertory and jumped to the top of the heap in
the East. Nobody took tlic lthacans very seri-
ously until the liistoric 22'-l-14 uphill struggle of
last fall.

Alva K(>ll<*y. 21 t°*m-incr Sliatlysitle academy boy.
has made rabid alunml forgot. that Holland mxcr
cavorted beside C-ayuga’s water's. One lmmlred
and seventy-ﬁve pounds of d_vna.mite. this brilliant,
end catches passes in the most opportune moments
and spills enemy ball carriers with reckless
abandon. At the other terminal, there is little
to choose between Jim Schmuck and Kirk Hcrsbc_\',
both 1.555 pound juniors who blossomed forth from
the junior \'arsit_v. Schmuck so far this season has
taken some of the publicity from Kelley, and has
produced some of 1940’s best end play.

At right tackle all--'\meric:1n Nick Drahos needs
no intro<luction. Posscssiiig one of the most edu-

cated place-kicking toes in the country, the 215
pound Drahos plays most of his games in the
enemy backﬁeld. At‘ the beginning of the 1939
campaign, he was the only first string lineman left
from the preceding season. Fred “Test and Tony
Blasko, 220 and 205 pounds of beef respectively,
alternate at the other tackle post. The guards
Howie Dunbar and Jim Conti had to ﬁll spots va-
cated by Hemingway and Roth, but‘ at this writ-
ing, this duo has a two year record surpassing
their predecessors.

F inneran Surprises

The most surprising shift of the whole squad
was that of Bud Finneran to the center post. A
third string quarterback in 1938, this omnipresent
pivot‘ star has been a two-year plague to oppon-
cuts on pass interceptions. He grabbed three of
Don Scott ’s in last Saturday ’s Ohio State tussle.

“The smartest quarterback in football” is often
the title applied to \lValt Matusczak, the steel-
filim'c(l blocker. On many occasions, Matusczak
has (*leaT’ed the way for jack-rabbit backs Whitey
Scholl, Hal McCullough, and Mort Landsberg. lt
was this brainy-signal caller-’s alert discernment
of a weakness in the Ohio State line that paved
the way for Scholl’s 71 yard sprint in last‘ _vear’s
Ohio St.-itc battle. Scholl, a 159 pound skitterburg,
is one of the best climax runners in the game today.
His rise to headlines was another example of the
obsur-<--ness in which lay Cornell football gems last
fall.

L\[::C11llo11gh and Landsberg, neither over 170
pounds soaking wet. also jumped into the spot-
light qiiickly. Another senior star back. Jack
L\lui-plxy sat on the sidelines all during his (sopho-
more year. Only junior to break into the lineup
in this all—scnior eleven is Len Bufalino. He failed
to receive any publicity with the array of unher-
alded juniors who jumped to the fore last year.

Of this great aggregation of backfield talent
none stands head and shoulders above his mates,
Altl1()11g'l1 they have gained more yardage than anv
other team in the country, thcre’s not one Harmon
or O’Bricn or Reagan in the pack. All have thrown
touclulown passes and all have scored touchdowns
on line plays. Lightning never strikes twice in
the sauic place, and this phalanx of all-star ball
l1a11<'ll¢-rs bezuus that theory out.

Harriers Whip Carnegie Tech;
Prepare for Penn State Match

After losing its ﬁrst three meets of
the season, the University of Pitts-
burgh cross country team defeated
Carnegie Tech, 15-40, last Saturday.
The Panthers looked convincing in
their ﬁrst win and should cause
their next opponent, Penn State,
plenty of worry.

Leading the pack of Pitt harriers
was co-captain Walt Sterner, who
ﬁnished ﬁrst almost two minutes
ahead of teammate Marcus Allias.
Sterner’s time was 23:57 while
Allias crossed the line in 25:32.

Tied for third place were two
other Blue and Gold runners, Frank
McCabe and John Brosky. These
athletes turned in ﬁne performances
and showed plenty of promise for
the coming meets. Positions num-
ber ﬁve and six went to Pittsters
Bob Davis and Bob Graham re-
spectively.

The outclassed Tartans managed
to escape with the next three posi-
tions and ‘thus prevent their team
from receiving a complete rout.
Ben" :Marcin «paced? the Tech run-
ners with Hardy and Teresi close
behind him. Saunders of the Pitt
squad ﬁnished in the tenth slot.

Highlights of the meet were the
outstanding performances of co-
captains Walt Sterner and Frank
McCabe. The former looked ex-
ceptionally good in winning, while

tomorrow, for only three games are
to be played. In decided contrast,

ing possible elimination from the

race.
The AE&ME team will be the

only team of prominence taking the
ﬁeld for action, their contest being
with the inferior Chemical Engi-
neer Freshman team. This is one
engineering tilt in which an upset
should not occur as the upperclass-
men of the AE&ME team have
many veterans back from their
strong unit of last year. The game
will start at 5 o’clock on ﬁeld 1.
For the first time in many years
the Newman club appears to have a
disappointing season ahead of them.
An early season forfeit loss puts
them in a bad spot for today’s game,
and should be able to squeeze out a
close victory. Captain Phil Lynch
will lead his cohorts into the fray

with the Golden ears at 4 oclock on
ﬁeld 1.

Varieties-YMCA will match two
mediocre teams, both of Whom
should hold no title visions in the
independent race. This game will
be played on ﬁeld 2 at 4 o’clock.

it Courts Will Render Decision

By Irwin Rosen
If you agree with the principles
of the New Deal, even though you
may agree with them only in part,
you have no other choice than to
support the candidacy of Franklin
D. Roosevelt. If you disagree with
the proposed Democratic plan of an
American—British “policing" of the
post-war world, then your man for
the presidency is Wendell Willkie.
These two issues, and only these
two issues, were cited as differences
in the platforms of the Republican
and Democratic candidates, by Lou-
is W". H. Johnston, instructor of po-
litical science, at the Pitt Town
Meeting last Monday afternoon.
Mr. Johnston told his listeners
that, although there were ﬁve c.ate-
gories of issues raised by support-
erslof both candidates, only the two
he cited could be considered as in-
trinsic differences, the other three
being merely the results of “emo-
tional partisanship.”
“The ﬁrst of these differences aris-
ing from emotional effervescence,”
declared. Mr. Johnston, “is the ‘fate
of democracy’ issue, over which such
cries as ‘Third term means dictator-
ship,’ and ‘Stop the growing cen-
tralization of government’ are
raised.” Democracy, according, to
Mr. Johnston, will be in no danger
no matter who wins, since there are
no signiﬁcant anti-democratic trends
in existence in America today.
9Both in their attitudes toward the
Eurdpean war, and in their plans
for national defense, there is a
marked similarity between Roose-
velt and Willkie, Mr. Johnston
stated. Either, if elected, will more

i0n NYA Inclusion in Hatch Act

Is it necessary for college stu-
dents working under the National
Youth administration to retain from
taking sides with any national po-
litical party because of the Hatch
Act?

That’s the question that is being
raised today on district college
campuses. ,

The Hatch act, passed in 1939 and
extended this year to state em-

7 ployes paid by the national gov-

ernment, prohibits recipients of
Federal funds from taking active
part in politics of any party. A
government worker may not be so-
“licited for funds although he may
make contributions for any party.
The act has been applied to WPA
workers.

At Westminster college James
Ludwig, president of the Willkie
College club charged that, because
of his NYA job, Michael Radock,
leader of the Roosevelt College club,
is a “Federal employe” and thus
forbidden from engaging in the
present political campaign. Ra-
dock has wired Attorney General
Jackson for a ruling on his case.

Louis C. Scott, district supervi-
sor of the NYA, advised that, in his
opinion, the act applies only to
project supervisors and directors of
policy, thus exempting NYA work-
ers. .

R. J. Munce, instructor in so-
ciology and director of NYAat the
University, stated, “I have had no
ruling with regard to the partici-
pation of NYA students in politics.”

Mr. Munce declared that this was
the ﬁrst case of this type that had
come to his attention and as “the
majority of NYA workers are under
the legal voting age, such cases are

Delts Pledge New
Mutt & Jeff Duo

Shortly before rush week, the
Delta Tau Delta fraternity put two
men through their formal initiatio.n.
They were Bill Sheris and Bill
Newbury, just two more actives to
plague the new crop of pledges.
And speaking of pledges, DTD wins
new laurels. Besides having the
most pledges, they also claim to
have pledged the tallest and the
shortest rushee. ' The tallest is
George Atherholt, 6 feet 6 inches;
and the shortest is Charlie Camarati,
5 feet 41/5; inches. And that, my
friends, is the long and the short
of it.

Tri-Delts. to Hold
Candles Friday

Candles, candles, and more can-
dles will be the theme of the dance
at the Delta Delta Delta house Fri-
day night. The girls claim the
candles will put their dates in a
romantic mood. Best of luck, girls.

"Alpha Omegas Add
Seven Th.is Week

It will be a busy week-end for
the Alpha Omega, professional
dental fraternity, when seven of
their neophytes change rank to
activesf The lucky boys are George
Fleischer. Ray Fried, Eugene Fold-
man, Lester Goldstein. alley
Grossfeld, Salvin Silverblatt, and
Harvey Sucknow. _ .

The dents are doing it up right
with three days of celebration.
Friday will be a night of enter-
tainment by the pledges. Saturday

probably very rare. I don’t think
that any NYA student would be
sufficiently active in politics to war-
rant any controversy.”

He admitted, however, that in his
opinion NYA students could be pro-
hibited from participating in politics
as a matter of legal technicality.

Professors in the School of Law
declined to make any deﬁnite com-
ment on the position of NYA em-
ployes under the act. Some said
that the employment contract ex-
isted between the worker and the
University, rather than between the
worker and the government. This
would, in effect, exempt" him from
the act, they said.

Others stated that the N YA work-
ers were not considered as “em-
ployes” but rather as recipients of
bounties, similar to those received
by WPA workers.

Most agreed that, despite the
wording of the Hatch act, NYA
participation in political activities
was in opposition with the “philoso-
phy behind the law.”

Band Boys Will. Dance
To W11rlitzer’s Music

Dancing to the music of Joe Wur-
litzer and his music, Pitt Band
members will have their ﬁrst in-
formal dance Friday evening in the
Cathedral gym from 9 till 12 o’clock.

Guy Wallace, E42, assistant band
manager, promises an all-star se-
lecti.on of band recordings. Jim
Hunter, BA42, social chairman, will
lead band members and their
friends at the dance.

Tickets selling at 50 cents should
be secured early because the dance

Phi Mus Enjoy
Two Big ights

There were two big nights for
the Phi Mu’s last week. The ﬁrst
was Monday with the initiation of
Jerry Steinacker. The second was
a “convention dinner” held on
Saturday at the Congress of Wom-
en's Clubs. Alumnae, mothers,
actives and pledges attended. The
highlight was a movie of the na-
tional convention at Glacier Na-
tional park.

'1-h¢i>iu News

or less continue with our present
defense plan, with few changes. he
went on, and either candidate will
do all he can, including war, to pre-
vent German domination of Europe
and Japanese domination of the
Orient. Any major differences cited
between the candidates over these
issues are purely the result of non-
objective thinking on the part of the
observer, and cannot, because of this.
be taken  authentic, Mr. Johnston
brought out.

Another “purely fictitious” differ-
ence between Roosevelt and Willkie
lies in their allegec “widely sepa-
rated” views on the domestic objec-
tives of the‘,N-cw Deal. Whether or
not |fRoosevelt‘ wins the election, Mr.
Johnston believed, the New Deal is
iere to stay. “The New Deal has
become an integral part of Ameri-
can lite, and no matter who wins,
will not be eradicated. Government
suppression of individual liberties in
favor of a program of social reform
will continue, whether it is headed
by Roosevelt or Willkie,” declared
Mi‘. Johnston. '

One of the only real diﬁererices
in platform, according to Mr. John-
ston, lies in the Republican’s antici-

pated decreases in the scope and
reach of the New Deal. Should
Willkie win, the New Deal would
be nulliﬁed by a gradual decrease
in government appropriations for
New Deal activities, rather than by
z.. sudden, smashing frontal attack.
The Republicans could not continue
to operate the New Deal as it has
been existing since it includes so
many principles hostile to groups
witliin their party, Mr. Johnston
pointed out.

Second of the “real issues” of the
campaign is what Mr. Johnston
called “the position of America in
the post-war world.” Presuming
the downfall of Germany, since
either candidate would be certain to
work toward that end, it would be
the Dem‘ocrat.ic party’s idea to join
witii Great Britain in a general po-
lzcing ofthe world. Willkie, on the
other han-d,has come out with no
plan for American participation in
post-war international activities, so
in this issue there could be no clash
of ideas, the instructor conclud-ed.

Following the speech. a period of
open discussion was led by Fred
I-lobie, C41, co-chairman of Pitt
Town Meeting.

of the ::olleg.e attended must be at-
inched to all designs.

Each design must be accompanied
by a paragraph of explanation as to
its practicality and appeal. not only
to the college girl but also to the
average young woman.

The Guild plans to keep all designs
for a period of four months (provid-
ing they are not accepted before)
and return same with helptiul com-
ments.

When a woman’s design is accept-
ed, she will be notiﬁed immediately
and a release and the accepted de-
sign will be sent to her. Both the
release and accepted design must be
signed by the designer and returned
to Campus Originals Guild. Then
E‘. check will be sent.

Any coed whose d-esign is accept-
ed will receive nationwide publicity
through the promotion of her mer-
chandise.

A varied collection of dental ap-
paratus, dating as far back as 1887,
has been assembled in the school
museum by Dr. H. E. Friesell, dean
of the School. of Dentistry, and Dr.
W. Harry Archer, assistant profes-
sor of anesthesia and exodontia.

The collection includes a long list
of dental literature and a prized set
of dental equipment—-anestlietia ma-
chines, syringes, and drugs.

Surgical. anesthesia was given to
the world over 90 years ago by two
pioneer dc-_'-nt.ists, Horace Wells, and
William T. G. l\/lorton. In his days
as a student, Dean Friesell associat-
ed with G. Q. Colton, the chemist
\\r ho supplied Mr. Wells witlgi nitrous
oxide gas for his first demonstra-
tion.

Dean Friesell and Dr. Archer have
bcen collecting e.xpei'iinen.tal appar-
atus from various parts of. the coun-
try for a number of years. Last
year the Pitt exhibit won first prize
at the annual meeting of the Amer-
ican Dental association.

“This collection,” Dr. Archer ex-
plained, “has much more than a
curiosity value. It is of great value
in teaming the evolution of anesthe-
sia and anesthetic equipment.”
