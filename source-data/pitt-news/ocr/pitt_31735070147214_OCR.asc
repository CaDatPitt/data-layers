Horoscopes

Mystic Stars weekly horoscope by Lasha Seniuk (MCT)

ARIES (March 21-April 20) Dis-
tant memories, yesterday’s love
aﬂairs and forgotten friendships
haveastrongappealthisweek. En-
joy nostalgic moments, but realize that expansive
change will soon arrive in present relationships.
The past might offer delightful distractions, but it
isthe wrong direction to take. Stayfocused. After
mid-week, a recently silent colleague or business
partner might challenge new ideas or express
strong opinions. Take none of it personally, and
expect hidden emotions and ongoing power strug-
gles to require diplomacy. Remain distant.

 

TAURUS (April 21-May 20)

Long-term friends express minor
jealousies concerning new rela-
tionships or added family obligations. Much of
this social doubt might actually reﬂect a fear of
abandonment. Provide added support and assur-

ance. Loved ones rnight be more vulnerable than
anticipated Starting tomorrow, some Taureans

will encounter a series of minor but meaning-

ﬁil workplace changes. New employees, delayed
schedules and revised documents might play a
vital role. Remain determined: Your ideas and
planswillbe accepted. ' '

 

 

3* GEMINI (May 21-June 21) Previ-

 

 

ously reluctant friends or lovers might this week

‘issuerareinvitations orprobeforﬁirther commit-

ment. Accept all such attention as compliments,
but still remain cautious. At present, loved ones
willcarefully stiidyallcomments, observations or
proposals. AﬁerThursday, two weeks offast social
and romantic progress will arrive. Stay focused.
Late this weekend a minor ﬁnancial error might
quickly escalate. Property agreements and home
contracts mightbeaffected.tIfso,verifyallcalcula—

tions and wait for new instructions.

CANCER (June 22~]uly22) Loved
ones will this week work hard to
verify old records, facts orﬁgures.
Key areas of concern might involve new friend-
ships, unusual family alliances or romantic dis-
trust. Remain quietlyinthe background and avoid
probing questions. Emotional tensions might be
high. Startingtomorrow, some Cancerians might

experience a dramatic increase in business and '

ﬁnancial activity. If so, careﬁilly study all docu-
ments orproposals for missinginformation. Stay

dedicated to long-terrn success and all will work ‘

to your advantage.

' LEO(July23—Aug. 22)Pastmisgiv-
 ings will be silently resolved this
' week. Expect lovers or long—term

 
    

  

friendstoprovide unique insights into their needs

. orbehaviors. Many Leoswillsoon experiencean

increaseinromantic invitations. Staybalanced and
watchfor delightful encounters. Later this week,
watch also for a fast employment agreement or
complex ﬁnancial proposal. An older colleague
might soon expand their daily work schedule to
include private business activities. Ask probing
questions: There’s much to be learned.

VIRGO (Aug. 23-Sept. 22) Sudden
ﬂashes ofwisdom mightnow reveal
- anew perspective on a complex
relationship. Past differences or repeated patterns
will soon be resolved. Hints, clues and unique ges-
tures from friends are also highlighted. Carefully
study all social discussions for valuable insights.
Later this week an old friend or distant relative
might reappear and ask for clarity. Key issues
might involve yesterday’s emotional triangles,
minor jealousies or complex proposals in love
relationships. Take your time: Times, dates and
facts will prove important.

‘ =  LIBRA (Sept. 23-Oct. 23) Previ-
ously silent colleagues might now
voice strong opinions. Early this
week, expect conﬂicting ideas and minor work-
place power struggles. Cooperation, although

  

 

vital for success at the moment, will notbe easily
obtained. Watch for strong reactions. Thursday
through Saturday accents minor home disrup-
tions and quickiamily discussions. Someone close
might wish to greatly expand his social network
or romantic options. Listen to all comments and
observations. Deep emotions andpastregretswill

» rise to the surface.

SCORPIO (Oct. 24-Nov. 22) Physi-

cal ﬁtness, vitality and sensuality
are highlighted over the next few
days. Friends and loved ones might offer compli-

ments or late invitations. Usethistimeto evaluate

or improve daily routines, exercise regimes and
ongoing social commitments. Later this week
some Scorpios might experience a sudden shiit of
priorities onthe workscene. Ifso, expectauthority

Student leadersdefend allocations process

Marissa Meredyth
‘ Senior Stajf Writer

Some student group leaders defended Student
Government Board and its allocation process
last night, a noteable change from previous
weeks’ meetings.

Although some group leaders have recently
criticized the process by calling it inconsistent,
others called it reasonable during last night’s
meeting in Nordy’s Place.

Board president Molly Stieber began the
meeting by explaining how important it was

for organizations seeking ﬁmding to come.

speak with the Board —— which is responsible
for allocating about $1 million of the Student
Activities fund —— before the weekly public
meeting. ' '

“We want you to do that beforehand,” Stie-

ber said. “We are really happy to speak with K

you and are always available.”

Stieber also clariﬁed the type of help avail-
able for those who are confused about the
process. All organizations have access to an
allocations liaison—who helps group leaders

write requests and shed light on allocation
rules—— but groups also have the option of
setting up a liaison with a ‘Board member.

Board member Ryan Gayman is leading the
Board member liaison program, an initiative
started last year by former Board member
David Gau. » —

Geoffrey Zettel, president of Men’s Ulti-
mate Frisbee Club, said in an e-mail that the
Board is not to blame for misunderstand-
ings.

“I have to say I’m disappointed by the ig-
norance of other groups and how it is giving
Allocations Committee and SGB a bad name,”
Zettel wrote in an e—mail.

The clubrequested $2,327.88 to attend a
tournament in Wilmington, N.C.-, which would
cover ground transportation, lodging and
an honorarium. They received $1,717.88 in a
decision that Zettel called “very fair.”

The part of the request that was denied,
$610, was ﬁinding for the B-team to attend
the event. It is precedent for the Board to only
fund for an A-team to compete, Allocations
Chairman Mike Bane said.

Zettel, like some student leaders, said he

was not aware of the various guidelines for the
allocations process when he ﬁrst became pres-
ident of his organization last November.

“I was able to quickly understand the pro-

. cess,” he said. “However, it took initiative on

my part to meet with the Allocations Comrnit—
tee and have them answer all my questions.”

He added that the SGB staff is “very re-
sponsive about anything you want to know.”

“Not all groups ﬁnd allocations confusing,
probably those who just do not take the time to
learn about it,” Zettel said. “It is not a simple
process, but one that can be understood if you
apply yourself.”

Pitt Club Tennis Team business manager
Scott Bronder shared similar feelings about
learning the process over time.

“I am not sure if this is the Board’s fault,
previous [executive] boards from the tennis

.team’s fault or my fault,” Bronder said. “But

coming into this year, I had absolutely no clue
as to how the allocation processworked.”
Bronder said he learned over the semester

. and admitted that it involved some trial and

error. .
“I would be lying if I said that I haven’t

messed up,” he said. “The team has suffered
to a degree, although nothing major ye ”

Bronder was frustrated learning the pro-
cess this way and share similar views with
Zettel. Bronder thought that the allocations
process is “lengthy and complicated.”

Bronder requested $1,076 to attend a tour-
nament later this month. The Board upheld the
Allocations Committee’s recommendation to
deny the request in ﬁill because of how much
money the team has already been allotted
this year. ~ ‘_

Bane saidthat the Pitt Club Tennis Team
has already received $5,400 for competi-
tions this academic year, which exceeds the
$5,000—per-club competition guideline.

“I am not happy about it,” Bronder said.
“I understand that there are a lot of student

‘ groups and can see reasoning behind putting

a limit on how much money each team should
be allowed.”

His frustration remains, as he said the team
cannot exist or compete at the‘ level it has in
the past without proper ﬁmding.

A website called Fiverr allows
people to post services they’re
willing to do for $5 for others to
purchase. If it sounds dirty, you
have a dirty mind. It really isn’t.

At Fiverr, members can offer,
buy or request different services.
Some featured services include “I
will design a custom logo for $5”
and “I will have my puppet sing
Happy Birthday to you on YouTube
for $5.” _

We think the website presents a

maybe make a few‘e3¢tra'freé1a"n2:e "“

graphic design, writing or playing
the French horn, the website has
multiple categories for services

others might be interested in.

On Fiverr, $4 of what the buyer
pays goes to the seller and $1 goes
to the website.

And though we’re sure your
gift-wrapping lessons or‘what-
ever should be valued at more
than $5, it’s a nice place to start.
Plus, if you make a few sales, you

can treat your sweetie to a nice $5"

THE MOUSTACHE COLUMN or AMERICA  

Today’s question: Isour children learning?

Oliver Bateman
Columnist

  

In the interest of politeness, we’ve
usually steered clear of contro-
versial topics. We’d much rather
wax poetic about our favorite Su-
per Smash Bros. Brawl character
(Ganondorf, of course) than tackle
a really important issue, like who
will win big at the Academy Awards
or why the last episode of Glee was
so terrible. This week, though,
we’ve decided to throw caution to
the wind and discuss the biggest
problem facing America today:
education. ‘ '
There are so many ways to go
from here, but let’s commence by
making the most obvious point.

First, as your grandparents have ‘

undoubtedly told you, there is a
general lack of knowledge in the
United States. People are dumber
than ever, with trillions unable to
communicate in anything more so—
phisticated than text-speak phrases
like “sup,” “nm u” and “a/s/l pls.”
According to research we just

made up, few living humans still
possess the ability to balance their
checkbooks, remember the names
of important presidents or com-
plete intermediate—level Sudoku
puzzles.

Why have people gotten so stu-

pid? The answer, we think, rests
with the educators. We’re sure
you’ve heard about that docu-
mentary “Waiting for ‘Superman,”’
which shows all the different ways
that these lazybones are falling our
students. American teachers, who
earn salaries that would make even
the great ﬁrst baseman “Prince” Al-
bert Pujols blush, have j obs that are
so simple that a DVD player com-
bined with a Scantron test grading
machine could replace them with
no drop-off in academic perfor-
mance. _ -

The best answer to this problem,
then, is to ﬁre all current teachers
and start again from scratch. How-
ever, those public sector unions are
standing in the way, trying to pro-
tect their members’ bloated pen-
sion plans and “Cadillac” health
insurance packages. Can you name
one good thing a union has done

ing to ESPN, Iranian officials are
threatening to boycottthe games
because they think the logo resem-
bles the word “Zion” — a biblical
term referring to Jerusalem,

We think these officials need
their eyes checked.

Seeing the word “Zion” in the
logo can only be achieved by read-
ing the numbers in illogical direc-
tions and turning some numbers
on their sides. Thatis a bit of a
stretch.

We think most people won’t
recognize anything unusual about
the logo except for its terrible de-
sign. . ’

According to ESPN, the Inter-

national Olympic Committee re— ,

sponded to Iran’s claims saying;

“The Loﬁéloﬁi2'0iéI6g6”fépres'efits  5   as

the ﬁgure-2012, nothing else.”
We agree that it only represents
the ﬁgure and,fwell, an example of

He’s the Messiah. Or so he claims
in a song. His fans think he’s witty,
entertaining and outspoken to the
point of being revolutionary. Dan
Bern is his own genre.

The musician is expected to ar-
rive in Pittsburgh on Thursday for
a live show at Diesel Club Lounge
in the Southside as part of his na-
tional tour. Currently living in Los
Angeles, Bern has recently written
songs for movies — such as “Walk
Hard: The Dewey Cox Story” and

.. “Get Him to the Greek.”

When writing for ﬁlms, Bern
said he tries to bring a character
to life by “merging with or be-

coming the character.” He tries to
think the same way the character
would.

Bern is a singer-songwriter, «
guitarist, novelist and painter,

and his live shows can often be
best described as stand-up com-
edy.

Wil Masisak, a Pitt graduate
who works with Bern, said in an e-
mail that on a typically energetic
day, Bern’s live shows are “a cross
between stand-up and a Southern
Pentecostal gospel show  lots
of truth, some laughs, some edu-
cation  you leave feeling better
than when you came in.”

Masisak produced two of
Bern’s albums and co—founded
the band the International Jew-
ish Banking Conspiracy, of which
both Bern and Masisak were once
members.

“The purpose of music is to
transport us somewhere — to
take us somewhere we’ve never
been,” Bern said.

A fan of the Beatles, Bern said
he doesn’t always ﬁnd it difficult
to discover sources of inspiration
for his lyrics. The ideas sometimes
seem to just “fall into  my lap,”

writing stories — something
that is_ reﬂected even today in his
songs, which are essentially sto-
ries set to music.

For instance, Bern wrote a
song — “Grandma and the FBI”

. —- inspired by a friend who got

a DWI.

Elements of politics, social
commentary, philosophy and per-
sonal details are fused into Bern’s
songs, often written in a stream-

performance style,” Deane Root,
a Pitt music professor, said in an
e-mail.

Both interviewers and re-
viewers have compared Bern to
Bob Dylan, but Bern says that he
doesn’t want to be labeled.

Masisak said that Bern’s music
cannot be categorized under the
label of American folk music.

“You say folk singer, I think

“Bob Dylan in the early 1960s

ence of youth, along with Odetta,

Root said he appreciates
Bern’s creativity “and his ability
to write and perform engagingly
in a variety of styles and formal
structures.” He added that, “Many
songwriters seem limited to the
verse—chorus song structure, but
not Dan Bern, who draws on near-
ly all the styles I mentioned.” He
referenced genres ranging from

cowboy ballads and traditional
ballads of the British Isles, as well
as African-American and Latino.
elements.

The inﬂuences, adaptations
and evolution of these styles come
full circle, Bern said. The most
interesting comment he has ever
received from a fan was that his
music “comes from the same place
as the American Indians.”

Bern seeks to convey many
ideas in his music, but if you ask
him to summarize in one line the
message that he would like to send
with his music and his life, he con-
templates for several seconds be-

Pitt looks to bounce back against USF

All the Pitt men’s basketball team
needed was one more win (and a
Notre Dame loss). Another mark in
the Panthers’ (25—4, 13-3 Big East)
victory column would have solidi-
ﬁed the 2011 regular season Big
East title for the team.
But after a 62-59 loss to the
Louisville Cardinals, Pitt’s hold
sen ﬁrst place is shrinking heading
into tonight’s game against South
Florida, where the No. 5 Panthers
have a chance to claim at least a
share of the Big Easttitle. 7 .
“We just can’t worry about the
pressure [to win the Big East title].
We just have to go out there and fo-

cus and take it one game at a time,” P
senior guard Brad Wanamaker said i

in a news conference this week.

Panthers turn in strong late —season performances

Isaac Saul
Stajf Writer

The long season in the pool for
the Pitt swim team has been a
tough one. But for three Panthers
swimmers, hard work paid off at
the ECAC Championships to land

Jghem possible spots in the NCAA
Tournament.

Freshman Alexander Roden-
kirk set a season—best time in the
100 free, while Christoph Berger
and Sarah Looney also placed
very well, ﬁghting through the

‘fatigue that the end of the season
brings.

“A good portion of us came back
from the Big East Championship
and swam in the ECAC Champi-
onships,” senior swimmer Alex

<"3Kubicek said. “For that two—week
series, we had to keep our morale
pretty hig .”

Two weeks ago, the women ﬁn-

East) is coming off an 86-76 vic-
tory against DePaul heading into
tonight’s game in Tampa, Fla.

This is the Panther’s second
meeting with the Bulls. Last
month, a late second—half 14-2
Panther rally propelled Pitt to a’
67-55 victory. _

But coming off a loss, the Pan-
thers need to regroup and focus
on beating the Bulls —— even if
South Florida only has three league
wins.

“They’re a really talented
team,” Pitt head coach Jamie Dixon
said of the Bulls this week. “They
have guys who can score inside and

. guys who can shoot outside the

perimeter.”

Absent from Pitt’s ﬁrst game
against South Florida was the Pan-
thers’ leading scorer Ashton Gibbs,
who missed several games because
of an injury. But Gibbs returned
last month and his 16-point—per-
game average could help the Pan-
thers avoid another close contest
against South Florida.

Between Gibbs’ shooting and

ished ﬁfth and the men ﬁnished
third at the Big East Champion-
ships. This‘ past weekend, the
swimming team competed in the
2011 ECAC Championships at
Trees Pool.

The tournament involved a
series of events, so some of the
team members had been consis-
tently competing for the last two
weeks.

“Anytime you have back to back
meets like that it’s a tough thing
to do,” head coach Chuck Knoles
said. “Having the meet here at the
University of Pittsburgh allowed us
to have a meet that was local and
didn’t cost us very much, but also
allowed us to step up and race.”

Those swimmers who were
feeling overworked didn’t have
to compete at the ECACs.

Kubicek understood that it
was going to be a grind, but he
said that the coaching staff of the

Wanamaker, the Panthers should
expect great outputfrom the team’s
backcourt.

me I’ve done a pretty 'good'jo'b on
offense. People have been telling
me I need to.be more aggressive
out there,” Wanamaker said. “I
just try to go out there and play
my game and try to do what is best
for the team. When Ifeel the time
is right, I’ll take the shot.”

In addition to the guards, Pitt
has beneﬁted from the aggressive
rebounding of its forwards. The

team is consistently there for the ,

athletes.

“The coaches did a really good
job helping out and not putting
too much pressure on us,” Kubicek
said. “They were keeping us in our
training routine and reminding us
what our mentality should be.”

As the ECAC wrapped up Sunday
night, Rodenkirk ﬁnished second
in the 100 free. His second-place
swim came with his season—best
45.83 time, which placed him third
in prelims. ,

“He’s been one of those kids
that, from the moment we started
recruiting him, we expected big
things out of him,” Knoles said.
“Every single meet that he-swam
in this season, he got better at
something.” '

Two other Panthers made the
ﬁnals of the ECAC as well.

In the 200 back, Berger ad-
vanced to the ﬁnals as the seventh

“[Reb‘ounding] is deﬁnitely

rebounding team. We just have to
attack them on the glass and try

‘ to get second shot opportunities,”
McGhee said. “That’s something‘

seed with a season best 1:52.68.

As part of her ﬁnal ECAC Cham-
pionship, Looney of the women’s
team swam in the consolation
ﬁnal of the 100 free. She placed
15th in prelims with a season—best
1:52.68.

Later, Berger came back and

‘ﬁnished seventh in the 200 back

with a time of 1:53.88. This was
his ﬁrst medal in an ECAC Cham-
pionship.

As the championship season
continues, the Panthers are cur-
rently awaiting NCAA berths to
see if their times qualify as other
meets-are going on across the
country. i

‘-‘If you have a fast time, you can
possibly get invited in,” Kubicek
said. “We’re still sitting on the
edge waiting to see if we can get
the invite.”

Diving events will be held March
11-13 in Annapolis, Md. Women’s

we didn’t do against Louisville,
so we’re looking forward to com-

_ ingout against South Florida and

crashing on the glass.”

Six-foot-10 South Florida
forward Augustus Gilchrist will
look to match up physically with
McGhee under the hoop. He is the
Bulls’ leading scorer, averaging 12
points per game. ‘

“It’s a team that has a talented
inside and the guards are getting
more and more comfortable with
one another, so we’re getting ready
for them and doing our best to pre-
pare for the game,” Dixon said.

‘ The Panther players know they '

cannot afford to take South Florida
lightly, despite the Bulls’ losing're-
cord.

“In March, teams come at you.
For us to win games, we need to
be prepared from start to ﬁnish.
We’ve been playing as a second-half
team in the last couple of games,
but that’s going to change,” Wa-
namaker said. “We need to handle
business from the jump ball, and
that’s what we are going to do.”|

NCAA swimming action begins on
March 17 in Austin, Texas, and the
men will travel to Minneapolis on
March 24. The team members will
learn laterthis week whether they
will receive an NCAA berth.

“For the kids that look like they
have a pretty good shot of advanc-
ing to the NCAAs, we keep them in
the water and active,” Knoles said.

"‘For the kids who don’t seem to

have a shot, we give them a_ break
and get back to work the Monday
after spring break.”

Being invited to swim in the
NCAA Tournament is a huge honor,
and Kubicek recognizes that.

“Especially for our sport,” Ku-
bicek said. “It’s the fastest swim-
mers on the planet. Even with the
Olympics, because a lot of foreign

swimmers come to the United .

States for universities and to train,
so NCAAs is avery large honor for
our sport.” I
