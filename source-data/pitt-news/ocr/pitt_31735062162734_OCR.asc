Age of Jackson.”

“The Crisis of the Old Order,”
the ﬁrst volume of his new wdrk
“The Age of Roosevelt,” has'al-
ready received many reviews and
was a -Book-of—the-Month; Club
selection. He is established as one
of America’s leading historians.

In 1939, the year after he
graduated from Harvard, summa

cum laude, his honors essay was

0 published under -the title_ of

“0restcs A. Brownson: A Pil-

- grim’s Progress.” It received
high praise from the critics‘ and
was a. selection of‘ the Catholic
Book Club.

During the war, Schlesinger was

Deputy Chief of the O’ss—Paris Re-‘
‘ports Board, and a corporal’ in the

Army. In the meantime, he com-
pleted work on “The Age of J ack-

son,” a- book he had worked on.

before the war as a Henry Fellow
at Cambridge University, England,

the university announced today.

Tuition increases in those schools not covered by the $5

made. In these schools, which are- some of the 13 professional
schools, the-increases‘ will’ be made in the_ﬂat tuition rates

' (A schedule of these schools. and the increases is listed '_I

below.)‘ .

The $28 a credit tuition charge will apply to students-‘in
the School ofithe Liberal Arts, Business Administration, En-
gineering, Mines, Education, Nursing, General Studies, the.
College of the Academic Disciplines and to part-time students.‘

The new tuition rate will mean an increase of $75 a tri-

for one trimester will average $420. ‘

The university'fee' of '$48 a term charged all full-time‘ I 

students and $4 "a credit. charged part-time students will re-

The income from the tuition in-‘

crease has been estimated at two
million. dollars. According to
Chancellor Litchﬁeld most of the
extra income‘ would be used to
improve faculty salaries and in
other direct ways strengthen the
academic programs of the uni-
versity. .

ity’s budget. - '"
He emphasized that“ the uni-
versity has adopted stringent eco-
nomies in all areas, but the gen-
eral rise in overall costs have
forced the need for additional in-
come. Even with, the increase, the
students will pay on the average
only one-half the cost of their

0 education, he pointed out.

Offer More‘ Aid
Dr. Litchﬁeld said additional

scholarship and loan funds will"be-

made available to the students
who may need ﬁnancial help. to
meet the new’ tuition rates. The
university will_ have more than
$1,575,000 available in student aid

 in 1960, he said. This is compared

to only. $848,500 that was avail-
able three years ago.

In discussing the tuition in-
creases and the necessity for it,
Chancellor Litchﬁeld_ outlined
the many new programs and-
policies instituted by the uni-

years. 1
Such. facilities as the. new Stu-‘

RegistrationLines’ ~

‘ Doom Is F oreseen

By KATHY GRANT
Endicott Batchelder, university registrar, has express-
ed ‘his satisfaction withthe smooth function of this trimes-
ter’s registration ofgapproximately 11,000 students.
“I believe that those students who were not required to

said. V

He attributed the success to the
pre-registration program, the pre-
viously prepared invoices and the
method by which the students re-
ceived all their cards in one en-
velope.

Lines Take Time

He pointed out that most of the
registration time is taken up by
standing in lines. According to the
schedule assignments sent to stu-
dents, an equal amount of students
should have been registering at
each session.

The congestion, therefore, was
not the fault of the Registrar’s
Oﬁice. Because students did not
come when they were assigned,
there were about 300 extra peo-
ple» present on Monday morn-
ing.

Batchelder also said, “I was un-
happy about the number of
changes.that were made in pro-
grams because each change meant
the dropping or changing of a
course and new class cards. ‘This
slowed down traffic and caused

confusion.”

To Use Machine _

“Of course,” he continued, “this
cannot be avoided in cases of fail-
ures and the student is hot to
blame.”

He also revealed a plan which
he considers feasable for future
registrations. It is the use of a

' machine which would ﬁll in the

student’s name, schedule and
other informatior called for on
the registration cards. ' /

This would obviate any writing
for the student, and the long lines.
All the student would have to do
is pick up his envelope and pay
the cashier.

Because of pre-registration the
student would know the cost of
his tuition and could have the
exact sum_ ready, which would
speed up the process. But here
too, the problem of course changes

_ would create confusion. _

Batchelder explained A t h a t
registration is necessary to the
student. With a student body as

1 large as this one, it is imperitive

to know where each student is
in case of an emergency.

~ Also through registration a rec-

ord of what courses the student
has taken and his grades are

ayailable at graduation.

’Dr. John Todd Cowles, profes-
sor of psychology at the univers-
ity’s School of Medicine, has been

Bishop Wrigltti
Slated to Speak
In SU Lounge

The Catholic Bishop of Pitts-
burgh, the Most Reverend John J.
Wright, will speak today during
an informal discussion hour at 3
p.m. in the SU Lounge. ' ’

Earlier today, Bishop Wright
spoke at the monthly meeting of
the Student Council of Religious
Organizations. His topic was
“Man’s Approach to God,” which
detailed the students’ knowledge
and certainty of the Divine Being.

Bishop Wright‘ _is one of the
leading ﬁgures on the national
religious scene in ‘America. Au-
thor of many books" and espec-
ially’ known for his addresses at
public events,,Bishop Wright has
always had a particular interest
in student and academic affairs.

SCRO will sponsor addresses by
other outstanding men in the ﬁeld

of religion during this trimester. M

On Feb. 10, Dean Walter Harrel-
son will speak to students on
“Liberal Protestantism.” Dr. Har-
relson is Dean of the Divinity
School of the University of Chi-
cago.

Tuition Increased

To, $28 A Credit
For Fall Triterm

(Continued from Page 1) (

Dr. Litchﬁeld pointed out that
two new schools have been esta-
blished -— the Graduate School of
Public and International Aﬁairs
and the School of Geenral Studies
— and one new department add-
ed’ —— the department of anthro-
pology in the division of social
sciences. W

Other departments such as
the department of geography
and the department of obstetrics
and gynecology have been ex-
panded. Other specialized pro-
grams like the Administrative

Science Center and the Regional

Commission on Educational Co-

ordination also have been ini-

tiated. .

In emphasizing the economies
adopted by the university, Chan-
cellor Litchﬁeld said a general
curriculum revision has resulted
in the elimination‘ of the ‘duplica-
tion of many courses. In non-
academic areas such as ’mainten-
ance of buildings more efficient
methods -and the introduction of
some automated devices has en-
abled the university "to reduce
costs appreciably.

He also said that revised in-
vestment of university_funds has
resulted in an increase in the re-
turn from endowments.

The tuition'_ at Johnstown Col-
lege also is being raised, but only
to $25 a credit. The fee of $36, or
$3 a credit, remains the same.

, the students out and they ran for their lives until they came‘ a
to a point designated as the ﬁnish line. '

Some students though, still were running when the end
came and had to be rounded up to be crowded back into

. the starting gate .so that they could start all over_ again.

’Whether this description is an exaggeration orinot de-

pends on which point of view it is being observed from. Un- .

doubtedly there are few students who do not have that
race-horse feeling. _We haven’t heard of too many. The fac-
ulty probably had a similar feeling. _ l .
For everyone’s sake, however, the past 15 weeks must

be ‘remembered only as an example of how a trimester
should not be run. If everyone continues tokdiscuss how.
«bad off he was last term, the present trimester will be nearly

gone before anyone realizes it. A .
' Obviously much is to be learned from the ﬁrst “merry

~

_c_hase.” There are avcouple of main complaints. The students

claim, and so rightfully so, they had extremely .too much
’-work to do in the time allotted. This includes‘ both work
' during the trimester and ﬁnals. '

From the faculty comesthe gripe that they weren’t in

given enough time in which -to present all the necessary

material in a decent manner. Then, they complain, again
V rightfully ‘so, they were unable to give the proper type of
A ﬁnal examinations. ' , ‘

' We are not sure that we must cite someone as “the”
culprit in the situation. We are sure ,though, that everyone
must realize his mistakes. Faculty members must plan their
work more wisely, if they haven’t already. Speciﬁcally,
.term papers must be assigned at an early date, not a few
weeks before the end of the trimester. e

For their own sake, students, too, must plan their work

. , more wisely. They must begin now and not wait until that

same ﬁnal few weeks to do the assignments.

As for that third party, the administration, it must solve
the problem of ﬁnal examinations. For surelythat ﬁasco in
the last week of the fall trimester was the perfect ﬁnish to
the race. Only approximately 13 weeks remain until it is
time for ﬁnals again. . - ,

Competent admistrators should be able to develop some
sanely workable system .

The ﬁrst trimester is past; there is nothing we can do

about it. But we can learn from our mistakes. The time to.

do‘ that isright now. .

Program Pondered . 

By Deborah Willson and Ina Amdur

Administration, faculty and students‘ have just
finished what might be called an experiment --' the
ﬁrst trimester at the iiniversity. Like any new pro-
gram, the trimester has its defects which should

"be corrected. . ' ‘
N 0 “on e of
these" - -groups
can be blamed
entirely to r
‘the difficulties
e n c o u n- -
t e r e d , b u t »
each of them
could contrib- .
ute toward-_:
lessening the
chaos of the
next term.

The advantages of ﬁnishing in a shorter time"
are outweighed by. the way in" which a student
gains his education. He must have time to inte-
grate what he is. learning in one course with his
present body of ‘knowledge and with his other
courses.

Miss Willson Miss Amdur

Although the trimester is only one week shorter‘

in class time, there are other circumstances that
must be considered. Under the former calendar,
the student washable to use Christmas vacation as
atime for reviewing and evaluating what he had
learned in, the ﬁrst part of the semester. '

Even though the student may not use the entire
vacation for this purpose, he still is not absorbing
new material at such a rapid pace. The chancellor
has said many times that he wishes -this university
to become one of the leading ones in the country.

Slower but Surer

Top students would probably prefer atending
a university where the‘ learning is less rapid and
more effective than it is on the trimester program.
For instance, in some universities there are reading
periods for the purpose of individual study and-re-
lated course readings. Even though the trimester
does not allow enough time for this type of pro-
gram, it must provide .— for an officially declared
‘ﬁnal examw k. ~  ..  ‘  V ,.

the spring trimester‘ on April 19. With only 409
students on campus for the third term, the goal of
a small, personalized liberal arts college willhave
been realized, , .

The Pirates will not react favorably to the
chancellor’s suggestion in May that the bleachers
be converted into a student section for ID card
holders. Not ‘even an offer of Knobby Knouse’s
cheerleaders will soften the’ Pirates’ opposition. '

The December announcement of the demolition
of the‘ Cathedral to make room for more faculty
parking will not be greeted with a storm of alumni
protest. “A great deal of wasted vertical space
has been eliminated by this move,” vice chancellor
Kent‘ Jarrell will comment. '

Need we say more?.

Revisions   Needed

students were“ responsible for. completing ‘term
papers, for ﬁnishing daily assignments and for
taking ﬁnal exams. A ﬁnal Lexam taken under
these/ circumstances is -neither a valid measure of

a student’s accomplishment nor an effective learn-

ing device for reviewing a semester’s work.
If the idea. behind the elimination of an‘ oﬂicial

_final exam week was the de-emphasis of "ﬁnals,

this goal was not achieved. Most professors gave
two-hour ﬁnal exams divided between Monday
and Wednesday, of the last week, and attendance

at‘Friday classes was either optional or not re--‘‘

cjuired. ' . \
Thus the last week became a poorly run ﬁnals’

week. By declaring a ﬁnal exam week, the ad-

ministration would save students from having ﬁve
exams in one day and also would re-establish the
educa_tive/value of ﬁnal exams.

"Each His Part

_.The faculty can’ co-operate with the administra-

courses to the demands of a slightly shortened
semester. In this way, last-minute course adjust-
ments would not be necessary. It also would be
advisable for the faculty to assign all required
work at the beginning of the term in order to
avoid cramming assignments into the last few

ﬁnal exam week would save the professors from
the overwhelming amount of work that they were
required to-complete in thelast week of the last
trimester.

The students, in turn, must ‘fulfill theobligationv

to the faculty and administration. V They can best
perform this by doing their work as it is assigned

_«and notwaiting until the end of the semester to
complete it. If the students, the ‘faculty and the -

xgj.

tion by adjusting their lectures and adapting their"

weeks. This kind of scheduling and the addition of . A

administration all co-operate, perhaps the trimester V

can eventually become an effective program of
education. ’

‘ Admittedly programs like this one need to be“

developed effectively because of the growing’ body
of students who need to" be educated. However,
there is no necessary‘ correlation between. rapid

Art Baker Leads
Orange Mafmen
_ In Home Opener

By TED COLTON

 

  

IIIIIIIIII
IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII

There will be plenty of excitement at the Field House
come next Saturday when Rex Peery’s wrestlers tangle with
the Orahgemen of Syracuse. It will be the home opener for
the Panthers and should prove to be an interesting one since
Syracuse will feature Art Baker, National 191-pound champ
and Eastern heavyweight title holder. ‘

Baker, who was a star fullback. on the .Orsange’s' National
football champions, will either be wrestling Tom Hall or Bob
Guzik. If Baker goes down to 191, he will ‘face Hall and if
he wrestles heavyweight,_footballer Guigzk willbe his man.

Wrestling is’ rapidly .-becoming the standout winter sport
in many of our major colleges. Such schoolsfas Cornell, Okla-
homa State, Penn State, Lehighand Iowa State will draw

morespectators for a wrestling match‘ than they will for the _ 
, round ball sport. I

At'Pitt we have one of the best wrestling teams _in
the country year in and year out.‘We also have the best
wrestling coach in the country, Rex Peery. We‘,also have
at the University a basketball team that won the Steel
Bowl tourney and_ has decided _to rest on its laurels for
the remainder of the season. ' A

This year the Panther wrestling squad will be the most
inexperienced one that Peerylhas had in a long _time. But take
no heed of this for three of these inexperienced;wrestlers-
will be winners for the Blue and Gold. Dick Martin, Daryl
Kelvington and John Zolikoff, all sophomores, are excellent

‘wrestlers, and give the‘ Cats a strong punch in the light-

weight divisions.
Martin, along with captain Larry, Lauchle, last. year’s,
_130-pound Eastern champ and runner up in the 123-
poundlclass in the Nationals, will give the Panthers the
- strongest one-two punch in the country. Both ‘boys could
very well wind up being National champs. They‘ have,
been nicknamed the Panther Mighty Mites. -- - .
Wrestling is one of the most competitive sports there is.
If a wrestler makes a mistake there arelno teammates to
help him out. He has to. get. by on his own skills and strength.
Wrestling is an art and requires, years of practicelin order
to perfect it. With a little understanding of the sport a specta-
tor can get moreexcitement out of a wrestling match’ than
he can out of some of our other major sports.

Apparently the ‘Panther ‘basketball team hasn’t heard
that the season for giving is over, for in the past week the
Cats handed ball games to Temple and Syracuse. Tomorrow
evening the Panthers will again -be at home. This time the
opposition will be William and Mary. A

Coach Bob Timmons attributes his team’s poor 4-7 rec-
ord to a lack of defense. “Defen-9

should be,” Timmons -said. “Be-
yond my ﬁrst ﬁve men I‘ don’t

bright spots in the hoopsters play,
but one of them has been Center
John Mills. Despite the team’s ‘$2-
74, loss to the Temple Owls, and

the 85-77 defeat at the hands of
Syracuse, Mills tallied 28 and 12
points respectively. - '
., Mills has also been one of the
' leading rebounders throughout the
season. After his 28 point effort
against Temple last week, Tim-
mons praised Mills for playing his
4 best all-around game of his col-
" lege career. ’ _ ,
John Fridley was the leading
scorer in the Syracuse defeat
as‘ he tossed in 18 points and

and quick shooting when getting
a “good.” basket seemed to be of
utmost importance.

Also the sub-par play’ of Dick
Falenski has been keeping the ex-
perts guessing. Saturday night
Falenski scored only -,3 points, an
effort’ far below his 15 point aver-
age. “When he is hitting,” Tim-
mons said, “he’s great, but when
he’s missing, he may as well be
on the bench.”_ I '

The Panthers have dropped
their last ﬁve games. In each
of them Falenski has had
trouble ﬁnding the range. “This
‘may. have been due to a bone
chip in his foot,” Timmons add-
ed. “You must also. remember
that a player or a team’s shoot-
ing percentage can be affected
by the opposition’s defense. A
good defense can make you take

cluded. ‘

50-46 last‘ Saturday evening to ‘in-
augurate gymnastics’ sixth season
at Skyscraper U. .
Springﬁeld captured four of the
six events in a losing cause. The

Indians’ Jeff Cardinali, one of the"

East’s top all-around performers,
won the side horse, high or hori-
zontal bar, and the parallel bar
contests to record a triple for the
hometown team.
I ‘Larry Hurbour provided "the
Indians’ other win by capturing
the rope climb in a rather fast
_ time of 4.1 seconds, but_ as far
as Panther fans were, concerned
the meet’s outstanding perform-
er could ' be none other than

Dave Hirst, one of the Jungle
Cats‘ co-captains.

Trailing by one point going into
the ﬁnal event,‘ ﬂying rings, Hirst,
along with teammate Tom Treese,
led the Panthers to a’ 10%-5%
margin andthus, save the victory
for the visiting Panthers. Hirst
won the rings and was closely
followed by Treese.

Hirst » recorded" the Panthers’
only other triumph by ‘taking
the tumbling contest. He was
followed by teammates Earl Mc-
Connell and Joe Battaglia as the
Blueand Gold swept the event
13-3. Battaglia was runnerup
on the rope while Panther How-

ard Coley was third.
