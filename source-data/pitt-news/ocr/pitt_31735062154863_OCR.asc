GA 3‘   Students Court  p

In the past two weeks much discussion concerning stu-

. , tered around the Interfraternity’"Council Judiciary "since
 the recent cases in which there have been violations have‘
 5 involved fraternities. A P‘
 There has been some difference of opinion among con- -
 cerned students as to what judicial commission should hear
" , whatcase. The great majority of fraternity men feel rather

strongly that the IF Judicial Commission should try all cases
involving fraternities or their members, ‘

,'\One letter writer commended the three fraternities
C‘ which were barred from Spring Carnival for “their never-
H.-wavering loyalty to the IF Council and its actions.” This is
. ‘fan unfortunate point ‘of view. Fraternity men are students
5?. at this U-niversity.-When they join the Greek organizations,
A‘ -they are merely joining another activity. a

._ — }There is nothing wrong with Greeks’ givingloyalty to
 their own ruling body, but they must realizethat there is a
-.body above them that possesses, by’ constitution, power over
all student ‘organizations. This, of course, is the Student
-fgovernment Association. _ ; ‘

 In directing the Judiciary. Committee at last Monday’s
 meeting to establish a student court, SGA has taken a def-
,‘ ~' inite step toward solving this problem of pjudiciaries. A def-
 inite need for this type of court exists. ~ g , _

At the present time, the only functioning judicialbody‘
.}»is, commendably enough, the one mentioned above, that of

_ IFC. Men's Court, once a part of Men’s Council, no longer
_ex_ists: it was abolished when the structure of MC‘ was _al-_ -
" 7 tered. The women’s Senior Court is a recognizedbody, but

‘ its actions, if any, have not been made known.

herefore, a student -court has its merits. It could serve
» as the highest court to which the student body would have

access. It would have the power to uphold or overrule
gany other judiciary._ Here is anexample of how the court
 system would operate. . .

- . ‘ A case involving a fraternity would ﬁrst be brought be-
‘I "fore the IF. Judiciary. If the fraternity were not satisﬁed
. "with that body’s decision‘, it could appeal to IF to have the

“case re—heard. Then, -no matter what the decision may be,
5' I the fraternity could make a ﬁnal appeal to the student court
; "of SGA. This would not be, as the same letter-writer men-
,_' -tioned above,_ ‘-‘cry—baby complaining.” It would be a natural
7 1, and accepted move by the fraternity. ' ~

_  L An individual, not in a fraternity,awould probably have.‘
 to have his case ‘heard directly by the student court.

— ‘The /SGA,Judiciary ‘Committee will meet problems .-in‘
—. .establishing_,this type of court, such as. who should com-
-‘ prise the body. But it is a job that should be Worked on dili-
- gently and accomplished with_all~ possible -speed. A student

mt

 court is long overdue.

A Look at’ Boo

Like mattresses, hearing aids and Mrs. Paul’s
Fresh ‘Frozen Fish" Sticks,’ books will soon.be-ad-
vertised orr television. Such ‘is the word of Ber-
nard Geis, a publishing veteran who last year left
Prentice’-Hall to think out the
scheme‘. He announced his plans
a few weeks __ago. _ - I ' ‘

Geis has formed? a new enter-
prise, Star. Press, "which .will be
managed jointly by himself and
several well—known television
personalities. The idea is toprint
hard.-covered books and
"then peddle them, coast to coast, .
during the -public’s favorite I
shows. . ‘ ~ '

The process will begin this fall, and Geis is
quite optimistic about his chances -forsuccess. He
says his partners “dwn mass audiences running

 

’into millions.” He also says, “We wi1l*print any-

thing _we think will sell to the popular market.”

follow Current Style . t

In view’ of such notions and intents, one begins
to wonder not only about Geis, but also about the
nature of the up and coming commercials. What
will they be like? Afterall, most television viewers

"have been away from books for a rather long time,

Probably,_since Geis is a popular-minded indi-
vidual,’ the commercials will ‘follow the ‘typical
current pattern. They will deliver their message
subtly, and ‘at the same time infer. that both
readers and writers, while intelligent, are actually
all-around regular guys. Probably, they will go
something like this: ,

husky cowboy is bouncingaround on the back‘ of,

a rampaging Brahma bull, which, after a few sec-.
onds, heaves him to the ground ‘in a cloud’ of dust.
He jumps up smiling. ' , ' -

“that was a pretty nice ride.”

' “Heh, heh,” answers the cowboy, “I’m no cow-'

Defends H. Keniston

Editor, The Pitt News:

The writer of the letter en-
titled “Mellon Appointment Call-

_ questions the good judgment of
the University Administration in
appointing Dr. Hayward Keniston
as Andrew Mellow Professor of
Romance Languages.

He feels that Dr. Keniston’s
age may prove a handicap in his
new position and that the. Uni-
versity needs "‘.more youngand
vigorous -scholars.’'- ,

I ,‘wonder if the author is

aware of the ‘fact’ -- that many

‘people considerably older than
‘our new Mellon Professor have

amazed the world by their vital-‘

ity and energy. The late Frank

I am also one_,0f the “mis-

it would be as difficult for them

Nevertheless it seems that they

After 2nd Win

By JACK Sl‘/IITH

Going after their second dual
meet win against one defeat, the
Panther Vtrackmen will play host
to- the .West ‘Virginia Mountaineers
Friday at Pitt Stadium.

West Virginia has ’a very small
track team and shouldn’t be too
rough for the Cats. Earlier in the
season the Mountaineers dropped
a’ dual meet to Slippery \Rock
Teachers.

Jay Moody’s foot, injured in
the Penn Relays last‘ weekend,
has healed sufficiently to enable
him to run and the team appears

to be at full strength;

According to Coach Carl Rees,
speedy . Mel Barnwell may run
in the 440-yard dash, a race he
‘has not yet attempted. The
Panther record-holder for this"
event is John Woodruff who ran
the quarter in 47 seconds in
1937. Barnwell ran a 47.1 quar-
‘ ter last weekend but had a run-
ning, start. '
.Com/menting. on last week’s

showing at the Penn Relays, Rees

said, “There seems to be a jinx

Co-captain Bill Hamilton will probably be on the mound
for the Panthers. when they clash with the West Virginia

baseball team this afternoon at Wildwood; The ‘game begins 9

at 3:30. ‘ - ‘

“I would like to throw I-Iamiltonl against West Virginia
because he has beaten them twice in his career, but if the

weather is at all on the cool sid-.. .9
I will no doubt change my selec-
tion to either Dick Wirth.\or Bob
Conti,” stated the Panthers’ coach,
Bobby Lewis, after yesterday’s
practice session.

“Hamilton has received a lot of
bumps this season for. no appar-
ent reason. He is throwing the
ball harder" than ever but can’t
seem to get anyone out._ I guess
Bill just isn’t able to do as well
in the cool weather, so I think I
might save him for__ Friday or
Saturday’s games if it’s cool to-
day,” Lewis added.

. Try For 6th Straight

Besides the tilt with the Moun-
taineers today, the Jungle Cats
will face Kent State on Friday and

will be at Wildwood.

. The Panthers will be seeking
their sixth straight win this aft-

came back to sweep double-

Spring Grid Game

New Faces

‘Saturday. . _ I
Injuries to

Cats. Cause
in Lineup

By TED COLTON , .

While the baseball season

is still in its infancy, the Pan-

ther gridders will take the spotlight Saturday afternoon at

the Wildwood ﬁeld when the

Blues meet the White ,for the

annual ‘spring intrasquad game at 2 pm.
Coach Johnny Michelosen will have his coaching‘ staff
split into units of three to guide the injury-ridden Panthers.

There will probably be many newe

faces in the starting lineup which
will be named tonight or tomor-

. row, because of a wave of injuries

that have hit the Jungle Cats in

4, the past week.

At "one point there were \32
players missing from drills. How-
ever,'some of these boys will be
ready to play by Saturday, and
the games shouldgive an inter-
esting preview for the 1959 season.

The quarterback position will
have two newcomers taking
their turns at leading the Blues

and the Whitesin the pre-sea- " .

son game. John Sakal and Dave
Kraus will be at the helm be-
cause of injuries to Ivan Toncic
and Pete Prince, the number one
and two signal callers.

Among the players who have

‘been looking very good in the

nightly scrimmages are Halfback
Chuck Reinhold and. Fullback Jim
"Cunningham, b o t h sophomores
who played key roles in several
of the Panthers’ victories last year.

Newcomers to keep an, eye on
are strong-arm Guard Larry Vig-
nali and Halfback Ray Tarasi.

._ Both are making strong bids for
’ berths on the ﬁrst two units.
