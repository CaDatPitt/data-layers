The evening of April 4 was a glor.-h
ions and eventful one for the Univere ,
sity of Pittsburgh Club of New York’ "
City-'_“I.1'1 the upper room of the Good:
Intent Coffee I-Iouse¥—the oldest build- .  S

.to‘gether. The room,‘ the walls‘ 6f 
which are decorated with convenient.-.7
tin match‘ boxes, pipe racks contain- .'_f._.;- A
in»? initialed clay pipes with stems _,oMt_.”.?‘ I‘-‘fa .
various lengths, old English pictures. f .
and framed clippings, was ﬁlled with
the warm -radiance of amber-colored‘
incandescent lights and candelabra ,
placed on the U-shaped table. The~Mf-._W
London drizzle outside added to the V .r'
quaintness of the setting. At 6:30‘‘- 1 I
Jarvis and his ‘assistant quietly, ami-"
ably and efficiently served a most‘de-M . —
licious dinner -to twenty-eight hungry.-
and enthusiastic Pittites. M

After the coffee Miss Helen Vogel-A
song, the Dreamtime Ladyat KDKA
who was present as the guest of Alpha
Burkhart, pulled the cork of the
meeting by telling a “bedtime story”
that brought down the house and kept
everyone smiling the rest of the even-
mg. , . . . - . . .
President Glaubitz then called the .. ,
meeting to order. The proposed con- ’_
stitution was amended by providing-
that chartenmembers of the club need
not pay the entrance fee, and that all
‘alumni who pay their dues to Decem- .
ber 31, "1923, at or before the May"
meeting shall be charter members.
'Another amendment provides that
in the event ‘of 'a. person becoming a
member, of the club after the com-
mencement of a calendar ‘year the I .
dues shall be pro-rated for the bal-
ance of the year. The dues from now
until December 31, 1923, are there-
fore‘$7.50 or $3.75 according to the f
class of membership. The constitu-"-=
tion was then unanimously adopted”

The question of incorporating the M
club under the Membership -Corpora- '
tions Law of New York was discussed
and the meeting voted unanimously in
favor of incorporating and every one
present signed and executed the Cer-
tiﬁcate .of Incorporation.

Work for‘ Club House. ,

A committee was appointed tosee.
about getting the New York alumni"
of «other Western Pennsylvania col-
legs-s organized and then, getting.sev-
eral such organizations to join with
the Pitt Club in acquiring a club
house. A committee was also appoint-I M
ed to prepare plans for a summer out?’ 1
ing of the club. Another committee _ I
was appointed to make plans for ‘a
j:-imboree on October 19th next, the
day before the Pitt football team will
appear for the first time in New York-
City. A M

The old oiﬁcers of the club will con-
tinue until the annual meeting in De- I L,
cember. Six directors were elected-» _ 
They are Vvilliam C. Cofﬁn, Henry L. ~ ‘
Tucker, E. Conway —-Shaler, Robert C. ' — . _.
Johnson, J. P. Johnston and Abram
Gross. P - \

The outstanding feature of the even-
ing was the wonderful spirit of the ‘M 
meeting. Everyone now and again: “ 
glanced back mentally over a period  ‘
of a few or many years to his univer- " M; ;
sity days. each saw ‘a different pic-_ 1 ,
ture but every. picture was of Pitt,‘ 5 
and “Pitt Inﬂuence” pervaded -the "
group. With many acquaintance has ‘
grown into fast friendship and ﬁrst  3
names were heard oftener and “Mis- 
ter” wa.s'l1e'ard less than at any pre-,  
vious meeting. M_ I:MvN

A smoker will be heldin the “Y”

have members of the Pittsburgh

rious. demonstrations whicli’ will in-
clude the playing of simultaneous

bitions, and the presentation of vari-
ous problem .and- trick games. Also,
several tournament matches of inter-
est will ,be played. 'rher"'e. will be the
usual cats and smokes.

This is the ﬁrst smoker of the year.
and the fraternity is particularly. de-

strong players, some of whom are

ment. These men. will be the nucleus
of our-future teams. Therefore, it is
-to their advantage to take part in all

they may become thoroughly familiar
with every aspect of the game.
these activities the smokers are an
important part. 5 ‘ '

Not only is it advantageous from

they will meet the members of visit-
ing organizations, men of
ability whom‘ they could meet in no
other way. As an example, last year
at one ofthe ‘smokers Mr. Bowers of
the Pittsburgh Chess Club, who was
then the champion of Western Penn-
sylvania, played a series of 18 simul-
taneous games of which he won 16,
drew one, and lostone. _ .

The chess tournament is progress-
ing rapidly, the ﬁrst round having
been completed. Although there have
been a few-minor upsets most of the
matches haverun true to form, the

‘out being -extended. Perhaps the
nearest to a realupset in the dope.
occurredin the Smyers-Smith match.
Smyers won. the ' ﬁrst game‘ easily.
This was according to the dope, and
the onlookers nodded approvingly.
_Then-‘Smith developed a streak of
brilliance, and before the startled au-
dience realized what had. occurred he

and the match was at one all. The
third game was a long drawn out af-
fair in which both players adopted a‘
conservative game. The advantage
wavered ' back and forth. Finally
Smyers broke- through and won.» The
match -took over ﬁve hours» and was
undoubtedly one of the hardest fought
matches. _ V
Another match, whichis’ to be play-
ed Monday has been attracting a.
great deal of attention.."This is the
Krow-Hack, match. Krow is a former
team man, and is the favorite in the
second part of the draw._ »I-lack, al-
though. he has never madethe team is
considered to be a player who is dan-
gerous. '  . ' ‘
The fraternity isconsidering sever-
al offers of matches
schools. Although nothing deﬁnite,
has been -decided upon it is probable
that the schedule will include Alle-
gheny College, Geneva College, Uni-
versity of Buffalo, Pittsburgh Chess
Club, Westinghouse Chess .Club and

others. , ,3

" HAVE ever considered it as the indispensable
duty of every member of society to promote, as
far as in him lies, the prosperity of every indi-
, vidual, but more especially of the community in
which hie,-belongs.” ‘— '
_ Life insurance is inseparably bound up with the
prosperity of every individual, family and community. * .
It is a secure and prosperous business and satisfactory
to the salesman in every way. ‘

The J01-IN HANCOCK would like to interest a few
ambitiousmen who graduate this year to make JOHN‘,
HANCOCK selling their life work.

Statistics on college graduates who have entered
life insurance place it at the very top as a source of
income. Before making a decision as to your Career
it would be well to make inquiries of the “Agency

~ assistant professor of pathology,

There has ‘A been much progress
made during the winter towards the
Last
spring Director of ’AAthle-tics Miller

talent ‘there. was in the University.
The result of this tournament were,

amazing ‘and brought out .a world of

unknown talent. I Pittsburgh always
has been a. center of golf interest

and especially since some national

tournaments have been held in -the
vicinity, but when the winner. of the
school. golf tournament, Hugh ;Moren,
turned in a '75 for the Schenley
course, some of the fans --began to
rub their eyes.‘ This tournament did
not bring-, out", only one star, but
many. Many of the entre—es“in the
tournament finished only ~a\ few
strokes in’ back ‘of the» Winner. , _

Some of the leading gprospects are
Poyman, the" track star, King, .’_I‘om-
Cannon, who was runner-up in the
ijuiniior cha.mp=ion‘ship_s, ‘Zimm;erman.
Gaddess and Manage-r Fawcett. Gad-
dess was eliminated from. the tourn-
galneunt in the ﬁrst round by lliugh
‘More-no, the: winner. . .-

‘Manager Fawcett "has scheduled
four. collegiate matches-. Pitt will
play W..& J. and State at Pittsburgh,
and return lnatches at Vvashington
and State College. The home con-
tests will, in all proba'bility, be played
on the Schenley course. There has
‘been no coach chosen as yet, but
Director Mille-r will appoint ‘one soon
to supervise theiteam. The ;captain
of the‘ team will not be chosen until
the makeup of the team has been
deﬁnitely chosen. , Golf is "a new ven-

-credit that the students can give it.

was also "‘mainta.ined' that ‘cancella-

-cause increased production',‘.'a ‘return
to the gold ‘standard, a balancing _of

is so extremely dependent,»-co1la.ps,e« as
a result of payment, nor to let her
home, markets be ruined *f’as' would

centered almost‘ entirely upon the

11213 TRACK TEAM

 

 

The Freshman track team is to get
its ﬁrst ‘test when they meet the
‘Schenley. High School track team at
Trees Stadium. on Saturday, April. 21.

A large squad of Freshmen have
been training hard but just what they
have in store is more or less an .un-
known quantity. The Schenley Hi
meet will give Coach Shea a line on
the new men and will _also give the
yearling squad a chance witl1_- some
outside competition before they. move
against "the strong teams from Penn
State and Kiski. - _ A

The" Fresh schedule is still in ques-
tion but meets have been closed with
Schenley for April 21, and with Kiski
at Saltsburg May" 30. A meet with the
Penn State Frosh is under way and is
a sure event ;of early May to be" staged
at -State College. ,

,The Freshman schedulepof this kind
to be successful . will tax the‘ 1926
squad to its highest point. All Fresh-
men that have had track experience
or who believe they have the “stuff”
to make good on the’ cinder path are

Q-‘-

‘Conti of the! Phi Kappas, Brown of
the‘ Phi. Gams, and.i'uMillikenu of the '
Phi Delta, ‘were the three leading
scorers in the Interfra,ternityBasket
Ball League "which closed ‘three
weeks agowhen Phi Kappa defeated
Phi Gamma. Delta in the ﬁnal. game
for the olﬁimpionsliip. Conti‘ led
with 49 points, and Milliken, Brown
and:~Mi1li_ken.followed with 42 and
36. Other leading scorers_ were =‘-Wil-
liams of the Ph1”Gams, who scored
a. total of 34, Linton of the Pi Lambs
who "registered ‘a total of $2, I-Ieasley
of the Theta Delts who scored 30,

‘istered 25 points, and Martin of the

, he p'arti,cipated that enabled the Phi»

Springeriof the Delta Tans who reg-

Sigma Chis who totaled 24. ’
Although -Conti is credited with
being the leading scorer, Brown gets
the honuor of having madeithe great-
est number of, ﬁeld goals. Browns
42 points were d.rue- to] 21 ﬁeld goals,
while 31 of Co-nti’s points were ac-
counted for -by. foul goals, But this
fact- should‘ not disparage Conti’s rec-
ord, as it was the ﬁne foul éhooting
of Conti in all the games in which

Kapp-as to .win the championship of
thetleague. \ ‘ .
Milliken of "the Phi Delts gets the
honor of scoring the greatest num-
ber of points per game. In the three
games that the Phi Delts‘ played Mil-
liken; scored, 36 points, giving - him
an average of 12 per game. -
' It «is interesting to note that 120
men, representing 14 fraternities, par-
ticipated in the ‘games this season,
despite the lfactthat nearly half of
the scheduledgames were not played.
Of these 120 only 60 did any scoring

of the 7bad weather, it has been im-'

possible to get any-idea of ﬁche calli-
bre of these men. Several of the can-
didates are. men who have .made
names for themselves on their prep
school nines, but there may be men
just as» good who have never had a
chance_ to , show their worth. The
‘batteries seems to be well bolstered
by Al Schmidt, _the.AlIegheny star.
who will ‘be counted on to win con-
sistently this year, while Buckley,
formerly of Peabody I-l/igh,. will be
available receiver for Schmidt-
Burger, the Kiski star, will. be a
candidate for shortstop. Bob Irwin,
who starred a.s a second baseman at
Bellefonte, will compete for the key‘-
ston-ei sack, while.Geoxrge, Fischer of
Allegheny, S-prin-ger and Chase will
-be contenders _.for the initial sack.
Chase, however, is in the hospital
undergoing an" operation for appendi-
-citis, and may not -be available for
the team this season- '
There are several ‘openings for
men who-have‘ .ability at the national
game., and Coach Barrett is asking
for candidates to report to him. at
once. ‘ . ‘ i

Coach Shea is utaszt rounding his men 1 H
into shape, that they may make a
creditable showing against the South- ‘ ’
erners. T '  _
Georgetown- has a remarkably 
strong team this year, as they also
had last‘ season when they defeated

the strong aggregation from Penn‘
State College. One of the‘ shining
luminaries in the team at Georgetown
is ‘Connelly, the holder of the’ inter-
collegiate" mile indoor record which
he ran. off at 4:17 1-5. The strong.
part. of the team is in the distances,
‘and although they have lost their all
around star, Legendre, who was the
nucleus of last year’s'. team. The
critics are expecting much from‘
Georgetown. ,
Little is known of the strength of
the Navy track team, but the sailors
gave the Panthers 2. trimming last
year. The newspapers. give the gobs
a ﬁne rating, and the Pitt athletes
must _not look lightly: upon the Nav
boys. - .
The runners. have not had ' their
ﬁnal tryouts to decide just who will
‘go South with the team, but the
coach has numerous stellar men to
take with him. VVakeﬁeld- an-(1
“Whitey” Ryman are the class of the
sp‘-rinters, and it might be said that
“Whitey” equaled Frank Shea’s rec-
ord for the tWo» laps on the indoor
track, whichgoes to prove that Ry- _
man will -give the opposing teams a. _
real race. The quarter mile will con-
sist of some of the following men:

 

‘Wakeﬁeld, Martin, Fawcett, Shaffer

Armstrong, Schrocdel, Wadkins and
Allen are being looked uponfby the
