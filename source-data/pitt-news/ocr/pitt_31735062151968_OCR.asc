R. L. Miall
To Speak

For Peace

British Student Will Address
Combined Peace Council,
Y Luncheon Today

 

 

Rowland L. Miall, British student
leader, will describe peace activities
of British students at a joint luncheon
meeting of the Pitt Peace Council and
the YM-YWCA co-ed upperclass club
today at 12:30 o’clock at the Y club-
rooms, Forbes and Bouquet Streets.

Miall, who has just arrived in the
United States to take part in the
Emergency Peace Campaign’s drive
to keep the United States ou't of war
and war out of the world, is presi-
dent of the Cambridge Student
Union. The Union is a student de-
bating society usually regarded as
training ground for Parliament.

Besides holding a position made fa-
mous by such men as Gladstone, As-
quith, and the Archbishops of Center-
bury and York, Miall has, in his offi-
cial capacity, met some of the most
noted of English politicians, including
C. R. Attlee, leader of the labor oppo-
s‘ition; Sir Samuel Hoare, former
British foreign minister; and M. Ave-
nol, secretary-general of ‘the League
of Nations.

Student of Politics

The speaker has studied at the Sor-
bonne in Paris, the University of Frei-
burg in Germany, and St. J ohn’s Col-
lege in Cambridge, where he concen-
trated on politics and journalism.

In 1934, he was appointed Cam-

bridge representative at the Institute
of International Relations at Geneva,
and last year represented the Um-
versity at the International Student
Service's annual conference at S1gtu-
na, Sweden. _ _
- Today’s meeting will begin the Pitt
Peace Council’s program of regular
noon meetings. Prior to Mial1’s ad-
dress, lunch will be served for 30
cents.

 

Dancing Tryouts
For WA A Affair
Scheduled Today

Dancing as it is practiced in coun-
tries across the sea will be the fea-
ture of a World Tour to be presented
at the annual WAA Cabaret two
weeks from today. More than twelve
different nations will be toured by the
spectators as they watch the folk
dances being presented.

Today at 4 o’clock in the gym, try-
outs for these folk dances will be held.
They are open to any WAA member,
and d-o not~-require any special abil-
ity. Only the Spanish, Russian and
Chinese dances will include solo num-
bers, for which special tryouts will
be announced later.

WAA Cabaret, a traditional affair,
is a major social event on the calen-
dar of women’s activities. It con-
sists of dinner and dancing and the
presentation of a show. Music for
the dinner dancing will be furnished
by an orchestra to be selected soon.

Virginia Boyd, Ed37, social chair-
man of WAA, is in charge of the
Cabaret, being held this year on
Wednesday, March 17. She will be
assisted by Betty Cox, Ed37, who
will plan the decorations; Mary
Weidle, C39, dinner, and Marion Lee
Patterson, C39, tickets.

Tickets will go on sale next week
for 35 cents to all non-WAA mem-
bers, and 25 cents to members. They
may be obtained from any WAA
board member, at the WAA candy
and sandwich stand, or at the gym.

Afternoon Affair To Display
Talents Of Performers
From Past Shows

By Robert Saffron

Luminaries of last year’s Cap and
Gown show and other entertainers
will appear at the club’s tea dance
this afternoon in the Webster Hall,
from 3 to 6 o’clock. The tentative
line-up was released by B. W. Bas-
kin, C37, president of the club.

Fred Kelly, who tapped on skates
in the show of two years ago, “In the
Soup,” and who is now back in
school, will do another specialty. And
Tom Steele, remembered for his fan-
cy footing in the “Yachting On the
Allegheny” number last year, has
promised to repeat. .

Floyd Nicklas, who ,wowed the
peasants when he murmured in his
sweet Italian dialect to a beauteous
brunette, “I’ll Middle-Aisle It With
You,” will warble the same song this
afternoon. “I Ain’t Foolin' and It.
Ain’t No Lie,” written by Herb Co-
hen, C38, will lie played by the
author himself, the “Commissar of
the Keyboard,” who has been known
to play three notes a second with mit-
tens on his hands.

In addition, John “Mouse” Fuller-
ton, front line beauty of the recent
chorus, will probably come dressed
in his cl1orine’s clothes. Special po-
lice have been hired to take care of
the dance ﬂoor, according to Mr.
Baskin.

Gene Kelly, dance director of the
shows, may show up. Said Baskin:
“Kelly will dance, or else—he won’t.
Bu't the Undergraduate Club cannot
guarantee that any of the above stars
will appear.”

The only certain thing is that the
orchestra will be the junior edition
of Charles Pallos’ combination, who
supplied the syncopation for the
club's recent _Masqiicrade Ball. The
price of admission is 25 cents per
couple.

Thomas Will Give Talk
On ‘Students And War’

 

Norman Thomas, leader of the‘
American Socialist party and several
times candidate for the presidency
on a Socialist ticket, will address Uni-
versity students on Monday from
12:30 to 1:30 o’clock. His subject
will be “Students and War.”

The meeting will be held in the
Schenley Hotel under the sponsor-
ship of several ‘campus organizations.

Fraternities
Start ‘Rush’
To In o r r o w

 

Silence Period For Women
Will Begin After Party
Saturday Evening

 

Beginning tomorrow night, eligible
freshmen and upperclass women will
join in the fraternity “rush” when
they attend the ﬁrst affair in a three-
day schedule of events.

“I hope that freshmen and eligible
upperclass women will enjoy the rush-
ing events, for fraternity women are
doing everything possible to make this
the most successful rushing season
Panhellenic Council has ever had,”
states Jean Lawson, C37, president
of the Council.

Only one affair is scheduled for to-
morrow. and it will begin at 5:30
and end a't 9:30 o’clock. Two events
are booked for Friday. The ﬁrst par-
ty, usually a luncheon, extends from
12:30 to 2:40 o’clock, and the sec-
ond, an evening party, begins at 5
and ends at 9:30 o’clock. Blanket
invitations have been extended for
these ;ifr.'airs.

Panhellenic Council has this year
changed the schedule of parties for
the ‘third day, Saturday, from the
traditional three events to two. This
change was made because both frater-
nity women and rushees were too
busy to enjoy fully all the events
scheduled. Rushees will receive in-
vitations to Sa‘turday’s two parties in
person on Friday.

The ﬁrst party on Saturday, com-
bining the breakfast and luncheon
held in former years, begins at 10
and continues until 2 o’clock. The
evening event, traditionally the long-
est and most elaborate affair given
by each fraternity, extends from 5
o‘clock until midnight. After each
affair, the fraternities are allowed an
extension of one-half hour to take
the rushees home.

Silence week begins immediately
after the midnight party on Saturday,
at 12:30 o’clock and extends until
the next Saturday at noon. During
this interval, fraternity women are
not permitted to carry on any con-
versations with rushees, according to
rushing rules set down by Panhel-
lenic.

Other plans considered before the

Conference Qn.

Constructs ldeal Legislature

 

Local Delegates Participate ’

In Preliminary Session
Of Political Meet

 

With eight schools represented, ‘the
Western Pennsylvania section of the
Intercollegiate Conference on Gov-
ernment completed preliminary plans
for the fourth annual meeting, on
Sunday.

In addition to the U.nive1'sity dele-
gation, the following attended: Du-
quesne, Mount Mercy, Pennsylvania
College For Women, St. Vincent Col-
lege, Allegheny College, Thiel Col-
lege and Slippery Rock State Teach-
ers’ College.

Miss Genevieve Blatt, graduate as-
sistant in political science and execu-
tive director of /the Conference,
opened the meeting. She outlined
procedure, and pointed out that this
year the Conference will act as a
model legislature; but rather than op-
erate under its own constitution, it
will opci-:=te under the existing state
C0ll.'t1lJlC'Jl1l)ll.

Rather than work individually,
members of all the delegations in the
city will meet together each Sunday
afternoon at Moun't Mercy College.
The ﬁrst of such meetings will be
held next Sunday at 2:30 o’clock.

All students are invited to become
members of the university group, and

to attend next Sunday’s meeting.

Director Of

Glee Club

Writes Music History

By Robert Brown

Perhaps the most striking thing
about Theodore M. Finney’s “History
of Music,” published recently by Har-
court Brace, is the fact that in its
600 odd pages there is a comprehen-
sive, highly readable account of mu-
sical development from its earliest
beginnings in ancient Greece to the
heavily-orchestrated experiments of
Stravinsky and Milhaud.

Mr. Finney, lecturer in music ap-
preciation at the University and di-
rector of the Men’s Glee Club, has
combined scholarly investigation with
rapid, ﬂuent prose in a volume that
is now widely used in many of the
universities and colleges of the
country.

It is now generally believed that
the so-called cultural activities of man
are a direct outgrowth of his social
and economic background. In his

book, Mr. Finney is careful to point
out that music development in the
main accords with this theory. The
late medieval and early Renaissance
music is simply a reflection of the
joyousness and sensitiveness of hu-
manity as it emerged from the static
background of medievalisnig, Bach‘:-:
great organ preludes and chorals are
monumental symbols of his Lutheran
faith; Bee'thove..n’s symphonies are
musical canvases where the composer
reveals the conﬂict of the new ra-
tionalism and the old beliefs; and El-
gar, with his bewildering tonalities,
seeks to portray the sense of doubt
and confusion of the mind of the
man of today.

Bu't the author does not attempt to
dictate to the student an_d general
reader. He does not attempt to say,
“This is good; all the critics say so,
therefore you must like it; but this

Unit Gives Puppet
Show At Meeting

 

Members of the freshman Stage-
ci'a:f_'t Unit presented a puppet .show at
their ﬁrst dinner meeting at Heinz
House, Monday night.

After a semester's experience in
stagecraft work, Betty Batty, C,
wrote the play which was presented
on the miniature stage before the
diners. The story enacted by the
puppets was “Parole and the Side-
walk Cafe.”

Puppets and the settings were con.-
structed by women in the unit. Miss
Batty and Arlene Broida pulled the
strings controlling the puppets. They
also spoke the dialogue.

Betty Fairall was in charge of the
dinner, to which all the unit mem-

For Filing

Applications

 

Education Students Should
Complete Arrangements
Before March 20

‘March 20 will be the deadline ﬁnal
for students to register applications
for admission to the School of Edn-
cation, according to Theodore A;
Siedle, assistant dean of the school.

All pre-education sophomores and
students in other divisions should ﬁle
applications promptly in the School
of Education oﬂice, Room 210, State
Hall. Immediately after March 20,
the records of applicants will be ex-
amined. and arrangements made for
students to appear for individual in-
terviews with a. faculty committee on
admissions. While no deﬁnite date
has been set for the interviews, they
will likely be scheduled during the
second week of April.

Sophomores who are interested in
becoming ‘eligible to teach in Penn-
sylvania. schools should particularly
note the change in regulations ef-
fective September, 1938. Mr. Siedle
explained that after that date stu-
dents in divisions other than the
School of Eclucatlon will not be per-
mitter.l to take introduction to teach-
ing and student teaching courses un-
til after they have completed their
degrees.

Scholastic achievement is consid-
ered in reviewing the records of stu-
dents who apply for admission to the
School of Education. Students must
have a .75 quality point average or
better, and in ‘the major ﬁeld a record
of 1.0 or better is expected. Other
items included in the evaluation are
a health rating, the psychological ex-
aniination score, and the personal in-
terview results.

Cass Announces

Cap, Gown Rules

“All applicants for parts in the
Cap and Gown cast must try out for
singing and dancing with Mr. Kelly,”
is the latest “must” issued by Carl
Cass, line director of this year’s show.

Successful actors who have passed
the preliminary tests may identify
themselves by their numbers on the
bulletin boards. They, and men who
have appeared in campus shows but
not in a singing or dancing role, will
be required to make appointments
with the dance director, Gene Kelly.

No ﬁnal tryouts will be held until
Monday. On this day, only those
whose numbers are posted or have
appeared in any previous campus pro-
duction will be heard.

Mr. Cass stated that any person
who has not yet tried out will be
heard, if there are a suﬁicient num-
ber. Applications must be made im-
mediately. In no case will ﬁrst tests
be made after Friday.

Still In Second Place

Pittsburgh now rests one victory
short of a tie with the Temple Owls
in percentage points for ‘the league
crown. If Temple knocks oﬂf West
Virginia in her ﬁnale, then the Carl-
sonmen must skin the Penn State
Lion in addition to outshooting this
same pesky Mountaineer to force the
play-off for the title.

Last night, both teams played er-
ratically, and at times looked like
anything bu't smooth-working basket-
ball outﬁts. Individual plays and
misplays stood out like disconsolate
legislators at a Men's Council “meet.”

Jesko’s last “home stand” was the
one bright spot on an otherwise rag-
ged evening of basketball. With the
exception of a ﬁrst-half shooting
streak that misﬁred no less than 11
times, a rare situation for Mr. Jesko,
the South Sider performed brilliantly
on both defense and offense, with 15
markers in turning in a ﬁne ﬂoor
game for his evening's work.

Research B u r e a u
Announces L o c al
Payroll I n c r e a s e

 

Payroll lists are increasing and the
number of people on the relief rolls
is decreasing, according to the Uni-
versity’s Bureau of Business Re-
search. The main reason for this
gain in employment, states the Bu-
reau, is the hiring of a considerable
number of workers in the iron and
steel industries, and the glass, chemi-
cal, and lumber industries.

Although there is usually a large
decrease in the employment of non-
manufacturing ﬁrms in the Pitts-
burgh district between the months of
December and January, this year the
decrease was much smaller than in
any other year before the depression.
The Bureau’s all-ﬁrms employment
index in January stood 89.9 per cent
of the 1929 average; it was 78.3 per
cent in January last year and 66.6
per cent in January, 1933.

Factory employment in the district
rose 2.2 per cent, the index advanc-
ing from 95.0 in December to 97.1
in January. In other words, indus-
tries here employed only about 3 per
cent fewer people in January than
in the average month of 1929.

The Bureau believes that the re-

on the shoulders of these manufac-
turing ﬁrms. Iron and steel mills are
expected to hire many more men, be-
cause of the large navy steel order
obtained recently.

The Military Ball committee re-

excessive sale of tickets in the
ROTC corps and the fact that the
Ball tickets have been sold by in-
vitation, that it will be unable to
offer for sale any further tickets

guests.

1,700 couples crowded into the dance

there will be only 850 couples. To

Ball Committee is accounting for

To accommodate the dancers, the

the meantime, most Congressmen
would ‘have to stand for re-election,

this way, the judge contended, the

As he puts it, “Anything worth know-
ing about music and musicians is
eventually discernible in their music;
what has been written about music
should serve merely to shorten the
time involved in the ‘eventually.’ ’-’

The plan of the volume, in general,
follows that of most standard“texts.
The characteristics, time, and im.-
portance of each musical period are
dwelt upon, and then a short biogra-
phy of the principal composers, their
works, and their importance are pre-
sented. In a few short sentences, Mr.
Finney is able to dust off the minor
composers, list their importance, and
then store them “ away again.

‘Lovers of Mozart -‘will especially
appreciate the‘ writer’s remafks con-'
cerning him and his music. Too often,
we are forced to hear Mozart de-
scribed by the speaker at the weekly

Club as"“a composer whose sprightly
little melodies and simple li'ttle ron-
dos are beautiful,” or.-some such bal-

citing examples of the little. pock-
marked, billiard-loving German’s last
three symphonies and the D Minor
Quartet, written while Constance, his
wife, was undergoing the agonies of
childbirth, Mozart is ﬁnally given his
true. _prominence among the Zmusical
“greats.” ’ . ,

Mr. Finney employs clever phrases
to typify each composer's special
traits. ‘For example, in commenting
on Stravinsky, the pale Russian who
likes American cigarettes, he says:
"Despite his attempts to be _ unha-
man, his works are intensely inter-
esting human documen .” He speaks
of Tcha'ikowsky’s patheticism as be-
ing “most successful when it depicts, —
a _man who is enjoying feeling sorry
for himself.” '

And so, in conclusion, we may say
that this book, while not nearly so
voluminous as Grove and as scholarly
as Cobbett, is quite likely to occupy
the position of being one of the best
short histories of music in print to-
day.

-—by Frank Buck, of "Bring ’Em Back Alive” fan1e—-by
Eleanor Tennant, the outstanding woman tennis coach
of the U. S.——and by millions of other Camel smokers in
all walks of life. Enjoy Camels at every meal. They speed

for steady smoking. Light up a Camel and get a "lift.”

Cwens, sophomore women’s honor-
ary fraternity, have reprinted 100
copies of the Cwen Directory, which
are on sale today for 20 cents on the
first ﬂoors of the Cathedral and
Alumni Hall. *

Cwens is organized to render serv-
cc to the University, and the pro-

nain seivice projects of this organi-
zation. »

The C\v«:=n Directory contains the
iame, address, telephone number, and

xersity. Addition of the names of
.the February freshmen has been made
to the directory in the new issue.
' The booklet has been used in the
past in assembling women for parties,
teas, dinners, meetings and dates;
and has proved especially valuable in
':ont.a.cting women during vacations.

Edith Bart, C39, as chairman of
the service committee, is supervising
tlie selling. She is being assisted by

Baslcin Seeks Movie
Queen For IF Dance
As Fraters’ Partner

 

Latest word is that the chairman of
the Interfraternity Ball, Ben Wayne
Baskin, C37, is negotiating for a
movie queen to appear at the dance
on Friday, April 9, in the grand ball-
room of the W'illiam‘ Penn Hotel. .

The idea is that she will have a
dance with a chosen partner from
each of the 13 social fraternities. The
movie star will be picked by ballot of
the member fraternities as their hon-
orary beauty queen.

Another feature of the dance will
be the fraternity songs sweepstakes,
in which each will choose a song,
popular or otherwise, to be played by
the orchestra and dedicated to that
house.

Without: Victory

Wrestling seasons come and go but
the losing ways of Coach Eddie
Mazeski’s grapplers threaten to go on
forever. For the second straight
year the mat team literally ended up
on its back in every match. The Pan-
thers lost to Franklin and Marshall
36-0, to West Virginia 23-13, to Penn
State 34-0, and in the ﬁnal match

 

kept their “streak” intact by losing ._

to Temple 28-6.

Even in defeat, however, the Blue -

and Gold wrestlers showed some out-
standing menf Rudy Tomarelli, 125-
pounder, was‘ easily‘ the most consist-
ent of Coach Mazeski’s charges, win-
ning his bouts against "West Virginia.
and ‘Temple andlosing in the Penn-
State and -Franklin. and Marshall
meets by small time ‘advantages.

Other Panthers who" made tliings
tough in one match or another ,were
Cartwright, 115 lbs.; Russ Bedillion,
135 lbs.; Captain Neibel, 1,551-bs., and
Luke Richards, heavywei§iit;1' Cart-
wright, a sophomore, looked especially
good in the first two matches, "and
Richards made the strongest‘ showing
of his sh-ort career against the Moun-
taineers.

If experience will .help Mazeski_

mould a winning team, next‘ year’s
squad of ringmen should succeed in
ending the “victory drought” of the
mat sport here. Everyone except
Bedillion and Neibel will be back for
another “ﬂing” next winter.

Cartwright and Cambal, 165-pound-
er, are only sophomores. Tomarelli,
Richards and Simonoff, 145-pounder,
have one more year of competition,
and Mazéski is counting on these
men, together with a few excellent
freshman prospects, to bring Pitt out
of the mat doldrums.

for the Hoyas boosted both totals
to 18-12. '

Jesko’s sleeper followed Garcia’.=

“Zilch” Zeleznik interrupted a ses-
sion of the most ragged basketball
seen in these parts for some time,
but his two-pointer was countered by
two successful foul shots for the
Capital City boys.

Another Double Foul.

After a. brief rest. the wild play
continued with Pitt's Rowe and.Ho.ya
Murphy making good on a double
"foul. Kurtyka shoved one _;in- from
back-court, but a smart man-around
‘ play, "Johnson to Radvansky, held

Johnson and Jesko broke free from
‘a pile-up under the "How. basket, and
the South Side captain dribbled up

. Music In Words

LMOST a week has passed" since students assembled in Memo-
Airial Hall to witness the program of the 1937 Scholars’ Tap
Day, and to hear, incidentally, the latest performance of the Pitt
Band.

A week has passed and the affair is now listed as “old news”
as far as a majority on campus is concerned, but the memory_of
the quality of the Band’s repertoire lingers on, more than an in-
cidental, to those attending who appreciate music.

The Band has gone a long way——since that first Saturday back
in October 1911 when it made _its ﬁrst appearance with borrowed
instruments, dressed in the “official uniforms of mackinaws and
scarlet felt hats with blue tasse1s”——to reach its present peak of
development. _

Uniforms are, of course, not important. Men have made the
Pitt Band what it is today. So, along with James G. Oliver, C07,
and Dr. Earl Miller, D04, founders of the organization; M. S.
Rocereto, director from 1917 to 1935; and all the lesser luminaries
who have aided in its development, we offer a verbal vote of
thanks and”commendation to its present director, Lee M. Lock-
h rt.

a In two short years he has built, where his predecessors left
off, musical precision and individuality of presentation in a large
group of student musicians. Pitt has gained more from his knowl-
edge and abilityias director than canfbe acknowledged in these
few short paragraphs. '_ -_ ,_

Student Bandsmen have long been unsung for the quality of
the music they have produced. Their’s are efforts of long and
inconvenient hours of practice with little recognition for what
they do. Now and then a football audience stays after the game

to see and-1_~hear -them, but their’s are rose-bowlless thanks and in—_

sufficient ‘appreciation. A

- Juvenlllty ,
HERE is a law, more often than not obeyed in this, country,
that prohibits the carrying of ﬁrearms and other dangerous
weapons,- bombs andidynamite ‘included, to protect ‘persons and
property. ’ : ,1  ‘ _ _ -

And, it seems, there should be another law in this country to
prohibit the carrying of pencils by college students--particularly
at Pitt. V’ ‘

It’s- a sad"'3commentary upon students who frequently "lapse
into diatribes on -the illsof the student governing body, the
juvenilityof editors of campus’ publications, and the Hitler-like
people who hang “No Smoking” signs_._a_bou't the _c.l_a.ssr_<_>or,I_1,s_--=2l.
sad commentary when a ‘number of students go about using pencils
with the intent to deface the surface of newly-painted Walls.

Student governing bodies must continue to limit their activ-

ities to the major proportions of clean-up and “basl.<et-tossingl’-';.'
campaigns; Hitler-like people will continue to hang up “No Smok—" 
ing” signs; and college editors must limit themselves mainly to-

juvenile topics—all as long as some college students draw pencil
lines on the walls as they run down steps, as has been done, and
is still being done, on the stairways outside the Cathedral Library
rooms. '

There "ought to be a- law.” Student governing bodies would
welcome it, and college editors would feel that the rnillenium fol
dealing with important things had arrived.‘

The Fastest Game in The World

THE second collegiate hockey revival will be staged tomorrov.
night during the intermissions of the Hornet-Springﬁeld game
in the Garden rink in the campus district.

Just why this sport, if; properly handled, should not prove a
popular one with both the students and fans in the district is hard
to see. Hockey is just about the fastest, most thrilling of sports
We’d love to see Jock Sutherland and Clipper Smith put skates
on their respective squads and turn them loose on good fast ice
armed with good, stout hockey sticks, afcw pads, and a muddj.
October Saturday fresh in mind . . . ’

Tomorrow night a sextet of students from t_he University and
Carnegie Tech clash in a contest that may determine the future
of collegiate hockey in the Pittsburgh district. -
We are rooting for a successful revival, with thejconviction

that there is sufficient interest to organize and set up an extensive '

hockey program for the sports fans, a program that wouldprove
both ﬁnancially successful to the promoters and would succeed
in rounding out an already ﬁne athletic setup at this University.
Here’s to the success of the fastest game in the world! ‘

Thlrd-Party Leglslatlon

T’S too bad about the Greeks. ‘When college men ﬁnd it neces-
sary to bring.in a third party
the case seems virtually hopeless. .
If a University can’t teach the fundamentals, at least, of legis
lation to the extent that a group of men are competent to select

their own leaders, then it’s about time those in question ﬁnd out

a few things’ concerning majority rule by looking outside of a
University and watching how other men select their leaders. '

The political situation in the'United States is not the best
this world‘ has ever seen, but it at least emphasizes the point that
there is respect for legislation to the extent that threats of protest,
cecession,‘or boycott do not accompany each successive admin-
instrative change in our various governments.

Study S
In Comfort  

By Milton Lehman
(Editor's _Note: This is the sec- 7

ond in a series of articles dealing

with the mechanics and composi-

tion of the Cathedral Library.)

 

‘ “Not only designed for comfort
and beauty, but proposed for use:
that is the theme of the University
Library.” C
And that is the opinion of Mrs.
Helen H. Downs, lending librarian of
the University. According to Mrs.
Downs, “students sometimes fail tc
realize the potentialities of the li-
brary as a source of information.
Impressed by its beauty, they fail to
appreciate its utilitarian value.”
Systematized for eﬁiciency, the li-
brary is centered around the lending:
department under Mrs. Downs’ super-
vision.

where alphabetical ﬁles list all the
volumes in the library by title. 8113103
and subject matter. Students anno

tate the catalogue number of the vol c

ume, title, author, and their name and
address on the book request slips pro-
vided by the library.

These 4,-lips, taken to the delivery
hall, are thence sent through pneu-
matic tubes to the book stacks wherr
one of the three pages employed b3
the library locates the volumes de-
sired. These volumes are sent back
to the delivery desk through a re
volving, elevator-like apparatus with
the request slip.

When each student presents his
slip, he is given a numbered metal
check. As the book is received at the
desk, the student’s number is ﬂashed

on a lighted panel. “The average
time from the presentation of the re-
quest slip to the reception of the
volume is approximately three min-
utes,” according to Mrs. Downs.

Books are charged to the student
on the registration card stamped at
the beginning of each semester. Stu-
dent 1*e-gistration in the library is
kept on permanent ﬁle.

The lending department. also serves "

the University extension centers in
Erie, Johnstown, and Beaver, send-
ing out more than 2,000 volumes last
semester for the extension libraries.

The procedure for borrowing . .
books begins in the catalogue room;

The campus movie which was
shown recently at the Alumni Ban-
quet in Hotel Schenley was Chan-
cellor Bowman's idea. It was writ-
ten, ﬁlmed. edited, and announced
by Arthur Krows, who specializes
in making college and industrial
movies. Titled "Upward," the ﬁlm
depicts Pittsburgh in its early days, .
shows the original Academy and-
chancellor, and depicts how the
University students in classes now,

. will be the future heads of busi-

everywhere.

Dr. Lanfear, dean ‘of men, hopes
to show “Upward"_ to the student
body just as soon as possible. The
ﬁlm took two and a half weeks to
make, and was taken as a silent.
Background sound was added when
it was processed in New York, in-
cluding a recording of the Glee Club,
which they made recently in the
KDKA studios. The recording was
matched to a silent ﬁlm of the Glee
Club singing so that the scene gives
the impression of a direct recording.
