In a letter to Office of Residence

“vague and lacking in detailed

for the present security system,
including the escort policy.
Hubbard said more than 500

the proposal to the Security

A Grads May Lose Bids

For Housing In April

' BY BILL MOORE

Graduate students might not be
allowed to bid for dorm rooms
beginning this April if the demand
by incoming freshmen and return-
ing undergraduate residents is too
high.

Graduate and Professional Stu-
dent Association member Bill
Voharas announced Wednesday he
had been told the graduate dorm
residents would be closed out
beginning in April. “If they do

make the decision to keep grads out A

of the dorms,” Voharas complain-
ed, “they shouldn’t shaft the ones
that are living there presently.”
Priorities for room occupancy
had to be made because_of present
and predicted overcrowding’, Stu-
dent Affairs Vice Chancellor Alfred
Moye said Thursday. “Unfortun-
ately we don’t have enough
housing, and a major inﬂuence on
whether freshmen choose Pitt is
-whether" we can offer them
housing,” he said.
Housing Director Don Hughes
said returning upperclassmen get
first choice of the room assign-
ments, and freshmen admitted
with housing get second. Students
who relocate from the regional
xcampusies, transfers and commu-'
ters are given University housing
next. . , _
“The grads have no pecking
order,” Hughes said. “They come

commuters and other groups in no
special order.”
The priorities are based on the

number’ of applicants for University -

housing, he said, and the percen-
tages of each group in that number.

The University has bed space for
3,510 students, Moye estimated,
and 2,300 current dorm occupants
indicated they wish to return to the

dormitories. To accommodate frat _, 

many incoming freshmen resi-
dents, the University had to either
construct new dorms, rent dorm
spaces or reduce the number of
returnees, he said. , .
Nothing is official now, Moye
indicated, but eliminating graduate
students is being considered
seriously by the administrators
trying to reach a decision. “Grad
students are in a better position to
go out and find places on their
own,” he said.
If such a move were made,’ he
continued, it would be only until

more room could be found or the ~

rush for dorm space died down.

“If at any point we decide the ’

demand was not as great as

predicted,” he said, “I suspect ,,,.\

the grads would be let back in.”
Moye stressed that his office and
the other administrative ofﬁces
involved were “still trying” to
reach a solution that would be
amenable to students and adminis-
trators. I

Fonseca said a decision on the
dorm crunch

I However, the three-man board has

taken the unusual step of deter-
mining a position yesterday.
According to unconﬁrmed re-

ports, that decision will createfive
‘ ' bargaining units at Pitt: one unit in

NEWS ANALYSIS

the Law School, one in the Medical
School, one in the Health-Related
Professions, one on the provost’s
area and one in the Dental School.

If these reports are conﬁrmed,
the decision would cap nearly three
years of union activity at Pitt, as
well as 38 days of bargaining unit

,,~"-six‘ stimony. The ﬁnal decision had

’een postponed several times

-because of the complexity of the

issue, according to Labor Board
officials.

The unconﬁrmed reports‘ 3150
indicated the decision to create 3
separate bargaining unit for the

Dental School rested on a prece-

dent set at Temple University. The
State Board reportedly created a
separate bargaining unit at Temple
because the dental school there did
not petition for unionization.

The unconﬁrmed reports showed
that there may be . a dissenting
opinion in the State Board’s
recommendation, which would be a
first in the history of Pennsylvania
Labor Board history.

Apparently the existence of a
dissenting opinion would widen the
door to legal exceptions to the
Board’s. decisions. These legal
exceptions, expected in many
quarters before the rumors of a
dissenting opinion, will challenge
the Board’s decision.

Although a-
possibly could overturn the results
of a facultyunion election, hearings
on all exceptions will not be held
until after the election. The legal
exceptions could be expected to
push “back the date of a contract
negotiation, if a faculty union agent
is elected. .

'Much sooner will be the ﬁrst of a
series of pre-election conferences
in/ which the participating parties
will hammer out agreements on
issues such as the number and
distribution of polling places and
other election-related procedures.

Final conﬁrmation of the exact
nature of the -Harrisburg-based
Labor Board ruling could be
expected today, along with a
statement by the University and
the other parties.

Republican senatorial candidate
Arlen Specter encouraged students
to become more involved inlthe
political system, at a conference in
the Student Union.Wednesday.

“I am interested especially in
seeing students becoming more
involved in the government and its
processes,” Specter said, speaking
before about 50 students in the
Kurtzman Room. -

He warned students that the
two-party system is endangered
partially because of the lack of
participation in government. '

The former Philadelphia district
attorney said he was involved in the
attempted reform of the U.S. penal
system. In 1971 and 1972, Specter
servedgon the National Advisory
Council on Criminal Justice.

__'_The resolution of Watergate, he
said, sh'o'weci that the“ f‘system does
tend to work in the long run. In the
long run all conflicts are resolved.”

Specter’s view of the ‘_‘new
politics of 1976”
openness now lacking in govern-
ment. Candidates’ integrity is‘
essential, he said.

Billed as a ‘speaker about the

Warren‘ Commission, Specter said -

the commission had come to

“essentially correct conclusions” »

in establishing Lee Harvey Oswald
as President John Kennedy’s
assassin.

“The commission looked
through all the information it could
ﬁnd. and ‘could not prove a
conspiracy,” Specter said. Later,
however, he said “evidence has
come to the surface recently that
should require further investiga-
tion into the assassination.”

but he doesn't see himself in an
adversary relationship with it. A

As one of the major controllers of
Pitt's purse-strings, Dutton unfor-
tunately ﬁnds himself often playing
the villain in the eyes of students.
As an expert, it may often seem to
him that Student Government is
meddling where it shouldn’t be.

Assistant to the Chancellor
Edward Bozik, though he’s only
been at Pitt since late summer, has
his own opinions about Student
Government.

Bozik's first major difﬁculty was
dealing with students ‘in the
football ticket controversy last fall.
He thought Student Government
acted well in the turmoil, which led,

students than the SGB now _serves.

“It’s too much to expect one
group of seven people to serve as
the representatives. of so many
students,” he said, “The whole
system may have to be changed.”

Student Government is far from
perfect. Assailed as a clique of
egotistical opportunists from some
student quarters, and as an
insignificant band of crusaders
from a goodly portion of the
administration, it is operating
under a severe handicap. o

After talkingwith some adminis-
trators about the problem, it looks,

as if the ideal model for Student 

Government would be a team of 12

- Iran's Violcitions

Of Human Rights

On Jan. 1, 1976, The New York
Times reported that the govern-
ment of Iran has in a closed military
tribunal, sentenced 10 political
prisoners to death and another, a
woman, to 15 years in solitary
conﬁnement for the alleged killing
ofthree American military advisors
in -Iran. A woman, Manijeh
Ashrafzadeh Kermani, is among

"7-(those sentenced to death.

The three officers were among
some 300 American military
advisors in Iran assisting the Shah,
first to perpetuate his autocratic
rule over the Iranian people and
second to protect the economic and
strategic interest of the’ internation-
al monopolies in an, area containing
over 60% of the world's known oil
resources.’ To ensure free ﬂow of

poil from the Gulf region into

..,.

Europe, Japan, and the United
States, Iran has been groomed to
become the local gendarme.

In order to carry out his
responsibilities, the "Shah has spent
upward of $20 billion on purchasing
arms in the last ﬁve years. The
Ministry of War’s budget outstrips
gihat of the Ministry of Health by a
factor of six and the Ministry of
Education by a factor of three. In
the face of this extravagance, it is
not surprising that the illiteracy
rate is a staggering 75%, the
populace suffers from malnutrition,
and there are only 8,000 physicians
for a population of 34 million.

The deep contradictions between
the’ majority of the people on the
one hand who suffer from these
economic and social injustices, and
the regime, serving the interest of
a privileged minority and the
international monopolies on the
other., have bred widespread

confessions are then used in closed
military courts against the defend-
ants to justify harsh sentences.
Investigators from the U.N. Com-
.mission for Human Rights as well
‘as Amnesty International have
substantiated the reports regarding
the use of inhumane physical and
psychological torture of political
prisoners in Iran. Consequently,
Iran has been placed on a probation
list by the UN. Others on the list
include Chile, Brazil and ﬁve other
countries. To further intimidate the
political activists, SAVAK con-
tinues to severely torture the more
outspoken prisoners long after the
completion of their trial. Only a few
months ago, Le Monde reported
that nine political prisoners died

under these tortures while serving. ‘
their terms. In the past three years, .

the government has publicly
admitted execution, many by ﬁring
squad, of over 150 Iranian
dissenters, _mostly doctors, engi-

neers, and intellectuals. This ﬁgure ,

does not reflect anoth_er 1.00
political activists who, according to
the regime, were killed in street
confrontations.

In opposition to the Iranian
government's ﬂagrant violations of
the fundamental human rights and
its absolute disregard for the right
to democratic judicial proceedings,
the World Confederation of Iranian

Students since J an-. 3, haslaunched

hunger strikes in major European
and American cities including:
.Washington D.C., Chicago, Hous-
ton, San Francisco, Rome, Milan,
Stockholm, Amsterdam, Koln and

False Picture
ot Pitt Athletes

It's psuedo-intellectual elitists
such as Gene Grabowski (“Big
Hulk Behind ‘the Desk")_ that
perpetuate the myth that all
football players can do- with their
heads is ram them
football players. It is alsothis same
self-fulfilling ‘wish that makes
athletes as well as other University
students in similarly disadvantaged
academic situations feel their value
and potential as human beings
diminished. Believe it or not, there
are many people who attend the

~ University on scholarships, not for

the free-ride, but to ' prepare
themselves for’ careers tohelp

: others. The sooner this University,

specifically the Advising Center,
realizes that students would rather
take good, maybe even hard
courses that will develop their
potential for social action, rather
than Rocks 80, the sooner we can
settle down and talk about real
education. i

Psst...Hey, Mac, wanna Beatle-
bash? If you haven’t tuned into
WPGH’s Beatlebash yet, it may be
too late. The 50-hour marathon of
Beatle music played by WPGH
radio disc jockey Ronnie Aldrich,
ends today at 2 p.m.

The major purpose of the
Beatlebash, according to Aldrich
(his real name is Ron Moidel, but
he’s saving that name “for when
I’m, famous”), who is WPGH
production manager, is to raise
money for the Thomas J. Foerster
Press Old Newsboy Fund and
Children's Hospital. —

Originally a promotion gimmick,
the Bash has as a secondary goal to
break Guinness Book of World
Records’ record for playing one
performer’s music nonstop. The
present record is 48 hours and
three minutes of Johnny Mathis.

Operating under conditions spec-

‘ iﬁed by the Guinness Book, WPGH

is keepinga professional log of

For those out there who plan on

a few months. I — . ,

The March Society, a service

the second annual “Design for

participant should submit an essay
of no fewer than 1,200 words
discussing the implications of the

I following statement:

“Contemporary politicians suffer
from myopia. Their instinct .is to
think about immediate return,
immediate consequences. In opting
"for the popular expedient, _politi-

cians fail to deal with the most‘
-I, signiﬁcant long-term social, eco- -
‘ nomic and politicalproblems.

“Only through purposeful cul-
tural design can Western man
survive the ecological and techno-

- logical crisis which now confronts

him. If planned economics, perfec-
tionist societies and other Utopian
ventures have failed,- we must
remember that ‘unplanned, undie-
tated and unperfected cultures
havefailed. too.

Perhaps it is not now possible to‘ _
design a successful culture as a

whole, but we must design better
practices, if only in a piecemeal
fashion, and hope for their eventual
integration into abroader frame-

 A Theatrical Landmark

BY DAVID ASHLEY

John Gay’s The Beggar’s Opera,

 - ﬁrst produced in London in 1728, is
one of the half dozen or so most’

inﬂuential theatrical. works ever
created. It was one of the first
musical comedies to be seen on the

"American stage, and it spawned a

new genre of “ballad opera,”
inﬂuencing many dramatists over

. "the last 250 years—from Brecht
rand Weill, to Gilbert and Sullivan.

= After its opening night, fashion-,
able Italian opera——which it paro- ~

died—could never be seen in quite
and the

affected attendance at rival attrac-

. tions like Handel’s Siroe, which 4
>_ had the misfortune to open a few

weeks after the premiere of Gay’s
masterpiece. i
The Beggar’s Opera is really two

i “operas” in one. A short overture

allows the beggar to introduce his
opera and exit, not to reappear
until the suspenseful conclusion of
his work when the players
themselves overrule his desire that
the play should have a “moral

, ending” (the rakish hero is
y hanged) with the claim that operas 1,
V. must have a “happy”,ending. Thus .

they are instrumental in permitting
Captain Mach.eath‘———tne swash-

? I buckler on the scaffold—to descend

and join them in a rousing chorus.
This measure of reﬂexivity is

characteristic of the work as a

whole.
3 The satirical thrust of Gay’s
opera was aimed not merely at

. Italian operas (the soap operas of

their day) but at the social and

political circumstances of his time.’

The system of bribery and
nepotism fostered by Britain’s first
prime minister, Robert Walpole, is
satirized in the ﬁgure of Peachum

i—a fence and informer—who

makes no distinction between the
goods and the men of which he
disposes. Walpole’s “new soc-
ietv” is ridiculed in Peachum’s

FRANKLIN PKIRTGBORN FlLM—§iCl)iCliET\(—;3i'es'ents-

observation: “ ‘Tis but fitting

_that we should protect and

encourage Cheats, since we live by
them.” The popularity of The
Beggar’s ‘Opera made Gay a rich
man, but he was not allowed
another hit. Polly—a kind of
Beggar’s Opera Partll (they tried
that in those days too)——was
banned.

Polly fears for the life of her ‘

husband, Macheath the highwayman,
after his recent arrest. '

The City Players’ production of
The Beggar’s Opera, which opened
last night at Allegheny Community
Theatre on the North Side, is done
(as it should be) withiverve and
gusto. The large auditorium is put
to good use by director Gregory
Lehane, although when you can see
players approaching from 50 yards
away, it does seem a bit pointless
to have them hide momentarily
behind a small black curtain before
stepping onto the stage.

The set, designed by -Mitchell
Greenberg, is particularly effective
—largely comprised of a tall frame
serving as a backdrop, on which a
collage of objects is mounted.

‘Beggar's Opera’ Is Satire

Although not all of them are bona
ﬁde eighteenth-century artifacts,
they nicely symbolize the obses-
sion, prevalent at the time among
the well-to-do, with crudely fash-
ioned commodity-objects. * The
imagery is particularly effective in
this case, as the bourgeois
mentality of the fence, Peachum, is
a parody, on a deeper level, of the
nascent commodity-capitalism of
Walpole’s England. The backdrop

* also provides a catwalk: with stairs

leading downstage, providing an
added dimension for the action. .

tunes to hymnal melodies. The

adequate, if not exemplary.

display their thespian talents to the

Bergman’s Scenes From A Mar-

of both factors. ’

The best thing that could
possibly have happened to Ingmar
Bergman is Liv Ullman.‘ She
turned out to be the saving grace in
a movie’ that began well and
dragged on for three unnecessary
hours. At any time she can be
exactly what she wants you _to
believe her to be.

One thing that must be made
clear——Scenes comes from a show
made for Swedish television. It
originally was split into six
one-hour parts to be shown once a
week. The ﬁlm screenplay is
entirely different and should have
been severely cut in several places.

The “marriage”, between Ull-
man and Erlind Josephsen (who
appeared with Ullman in Berg-
man's Cries and Whispers) is a
tumultuous affair. The masochistic
relationship turns from hate to love
to violence to love to sex all in {We

Bergman’s main message comes
across very plainly. .

_The theme evidentally is sug-
gested by a line from the
movie—“Every which way we turn
it hurts.’-’ Bergman needed three
hours to communicate that mes-
sage when it was evident that
everyone in attendance got that

‘meaning, from the guy ﬁdgeting

beside me to the girl stretching to
ease the backache.

Too much like a soap opera but
still a landmark in the ﬁlm
industry, Scenes From A Marriage
could have used one more major
improvement. The actors spoke
Swedish and after quite ‘a number
of long speeches appeared hardly
any English subtitles. Everyone

what was written on the screen.
With these adjustments, the
viewing of a great movie might
have been possible. \

BY SUSAN MURRAY

Crashing a party is an art. In‘

order for the crashing to be , a
success, it must be done with style
and finesse.’ There is no need to
use any kind of violence to get in,

no matter how opposed one is to

the party-throwers. It is better to
subtly inﬁltrate the party and win
over those there with irresistible
charm. I -

It is no fun to crash a stranger’s
party. It is best to crash a party
where one is known and has not

. been invited. First, of course, find

out all the details of the party--who
is throwing it, where_it is going to

be, when .it startsand who" is- going '-

to be there. Try to find out what
people are wearing to the ‘party and

. get together with three, or four

people who also want to go but
have -not been invited.
Do not let slip any hint of the

l  ‘IS I '8  ' S " ‘plan to crash the party. Be very

careful about this. One of ‘the
biggest factors of a successful
crashingais the “element of

surprise.” If-those giving the party

ﬁnd out, it is best to abandon the
whole thing.

Wear the opposite of. what
everyone else is going to wear. If it

a casual party, dress up. Go to the
party bearing gifts; if no alcohol is
to be served, bring some. If they

bring moneyand get everyone to
gamble. If they are playing cards
for money, bring dice. Think up
something that will not be available
at the party and bring it along;

I don’t want to draw a
disparaging analogy, but isn’t the
197.6 basketball program reminis-
cent of the commercial with the
silly rabbit and the bowl of Trix
cereal? Whenever the sweet taste
of victory seems to be in the
Panthers’ grasp, that ﬂavor some-
how eludes them.
They can’t play any harder. After

I turning things around in the first
" j half against the Virginia Cavaliers,

gaining advantages of seven

‘ points, falling behind by 16 midway 
..-through the second half, then -
‘ creeping back, to within four with

less than two minutes remaining,
the Panthers desperate attempt fell
short. The ﬁnal was Virginia 75,
Pitt 68. .

Once again, the story was the

. ’ charity stripe. The Cats were 10 for
 j 11 in free throws, while the Ca_vs

were 31 of 38. Pitt outscored
Virginia by 14 points from the field,
behind a remarkable performance
from supersoph Larry Harris who
14 for 24 from the ﬂoor and six for
seven from the line for 34 points on
the evening.

Therein lies a problem the Cats
must overcome if they ever hope to

-improve upon their woeful 4-11

record. The next-highest scorer for
.the Panthers was point-guard Bob
_Shrewsbury who had eight points

* on only seven shots.

The game opened with Virginia
(as everyone expected) taking the

I T lead. The Panthers behind Harris,
V outscored the Virginians, 11-3,, to,

take a 23-16 lead.

From there until the intermis-
sion, the teams swapped buckets,
but the “Virginia foul-shooting

Q *co‘ntest” dropped the Cats lead to
- one, at‘37-36.

After Harris sank a technical foul

shot to open the lead to two at the

beginning of the second stanza, the

. scenario changed. That scrappy,

undermanned defense that had
held the Panthers torespectability

.fell apart when the much taller

Cavalliers went inside, where an

obvious mismatch took its toll.

Take this quick test.

Bloomsburg State is: (a) a trance

(b)' one of the 51 states of the
_United States of America, or (c) a
college whose unpredictable wrest-

If you picked (c), then either
"you’re very smart or you looked at
the answer before you made your
choice.

Tomorrow, the 9-1 miracle
Panthers are the guests of
Bloomsburg State—the biggest
question mark in college wrestling
history.

‘Before the regular season began».

State fans were rabid with thoughts ..

of a league championship—not to
mention a distant shot at the
national championship.

And with the likes of 126-
pounder Dexter Derr, 158-pounder
Dan Lechner, heavyweight Tino
DeMarco and 177-pounder Steve
Scheib (who was given an
honorable mention in the National

about which to cheer.

“We should beat them,” Pitt

uneasily, “but if we don’t go there
and wrestle our style, we'll get our
butts kicked. It won’t be a picnic.”

What would have been consider-

in the season could turn out to be
the Last Supper for Pitt’s league
championship hopes, especially

since 134-pounder Rande Stottle- .

myer (who was named to the
National Mat News’ All-Americans

,list) will be out of the lineup

because of an injury.

But Adams is still confident.

“We’ve not wrestled a team who
has been in better physical
condition than us,”. he claimed
proudly.

That’s probably why Adams
won’t be extremely worried when
he places Gregg Soergel into the
starting rotation. Soergel, a junior
who was 0-2 in dual meets last
year, will fit satisfactorily into the
lineup_ with Kevin Nellis (who was

BY YAIER LEHRER
Associate Sports Editor

The Owls of Temple University
will invade the Field House
tomorrow night for a game that
could very easily be titled the
Pennsylvania Hard Luck Classic,
for the game will feature a 2-10
team that has had almost a mirror
image of the season Pitt has had.

Against nationally ranked St.
John’s (a team defeated only by
Indiana, the nation's No. 1 team),
Temple had taken a lead at the
half, only to ﬁnd that at the end of
the game, it was seven points
behind.

The same thing happened.

Saturday against Penn. The Owls
were leading by nine points
at halftime and had led by as many
as 13 points during the game, but
they could not hold on. The

0.ua.l.<er.s. came fromﬁrehind .t.o..Wi_n....

55-52. .

The Owls are mirror images of
the Panthers in that they have
come oh, so close, but have fallen
way too short.

One reason is the relative youth
of the Temple, team (sound
familiar?).- There is not even one
senior starting for the Owls, forcing
the coach to shufﬂe freshmen on
and off the court.

One other problem with which
Pitt fans can identify is Temple’s
lack ofheight. The tallest man on
the starting roster is 6-8 junior
center Phil Brand, a center who
averages seven points and five

/ rebounds a game.

' Flanking Brand on the front line
are forwards Bruce Burnett and
Marty Stahurski, averaging 13.4
and 11.6 points per
respectively, At the . guard
positions are Tim Claxton (14.2

game, ‘

points per game) and Lou Canelli,

who recently won himself a spot on‘”“\

the starting roster with a 14-point
performance against Penn.

The starting Owl lineup presents
Pitt with a team it should be able to
beat. but with the type of luck each
team has been having, the game
may end in a tie.

The Cats’ could have won at
Virginia except for a tremendous
amount of foul trouble, and that
could be very important in the
Temple match because Pitt’s
aggressive defense is inherently
prone to fouling opponents, thus
giving up many points via the free
throw line. ~

If the Panthers can keep out offiﬁ.
foul trouble and if (now this is a big’  "

one) they can avoid the bad luck
that has plagued them this season,
a four-game Pitt losing streak could
come to a screeching halt.

The p0ssi.bl¢. return, of 1 1 Tom

‘ Richardsis crucial to a Pitt victory.

Richards provides able leadership
on the court, and although not a
prolific scorer, the senior guard is a
proﬁcient playmaker.

The Owls hope to end a 10-game
losing streak tomorrow night and
hope that for once, Lady Luck will
smile on them. They shouldn’-t
count on it too much, though.

The Lady is a stranger to these
parts.

Wrelsl-Iers Ready: Rande

BY cms HALL

Athletes at Pitt who by their
junior year have been named
All-Americans twice and have
firmly. established themselves as
leaders of a suddenly successful
team that has accomplished a
turnaround from steady loser to
consistent winner receive the
recognition and fan response due
them, don’t they? ' -

Right. Just look at Tony Dorsett.

Wrong. Just look at Rande
Stottlemyer.

Stottlemyer, a junior who wrest-
les at 134 pounds, realizes the
Panther wrestlers have a publicity
problem (“Of course you get
disappointed”), but sees hope for
the future. I -

“Whenever you .start winning,
the people seem to come out,”
Stottlemyer says.

Stottlemyer’s patience in waiting
for some fan support is tried by the
continued lack of student interest,
despite the team’s 9-1 record and
lofty place in the national stand-
ings: ‘

“I really don’t want a lot of
publicity for myself,” Stottlemyer
claimed, “but I’m hoping to see a
lot of people out for our last three
matches.”

Those three matches at home
will bring Millersville, Clarion and
Lock Haven to the Field House, and
one of them——Clarion—will be of

special importance to Stottlemyer.
“I almost went there,” he
explained. “It came down to
Clarion and Pitt. They always have
a tough team up at Clarion, and
each class is going to be a good

‘matchpup, but I think we can do it.”

Stottlemyer’s opponent in the

Clarion match will ensure that the

134-pound event will be especially
good. When the two met last year,
Stottlemyer won, 8-5, but he
admits, “he had me going.” And
when they last met, over the
summer, Stottlemyer’s victory was
by the narrowest of wrestling
margins-—the referee’s decision.

Losing is not something to which
Stottlemyer is accustomed. His
three-year record at Pitt is 33-5-2,
including a mark of I2-1-1 so far
this season.

A two-time All-American, Stot-
tlemyer is confident of his ability to
achieve that status during each of
his four seasons at Pitt. He does,
however, feel the weight of his two
titles when he walks onto the mat.

“I realize some of the freshman
whom I’m up against have nothing
to lose. And sometimes it’s bad
that I feel this way, because this
has the tendency to make me feel a
lot of pressure, andlthis isn’t good.
But Ijust try to forget it and go out
there and wrestle for eight minutes
as well as I can.”

Stottlemyer,has been wrestling
as well as almost anyone can for

Freshman Swim Star

several years now. A state

a‘

:2‘,

._,

runnerup at Hickory High School in‘ ‘»

Sharpsville, Pennsylvania, he has
progressed as a wrestler along with
the entire Panther wrestling team.
he sees this year’s squad as an
aggressive group, and credits
coaches Dave Adams and George
Bryant for much of the Panthers’
success.

He sees his team as one of the
top 12 of 15 teams nationally, and
one of the four top Eastern
contenders. And he sees them on
the way up.

“When I ca_me in as a freshman,
one of the things I wanted to do was
help turn this program around, and

with the recruiting job that Coacl:g5—\,

Adams has done, the program has“-. 

been turned around.” To Pitt’s
future opponents, Stottlemyer cau-
tions, “Watch out.”

And to Pitt students, he suggests
that a trip to the Field House on
Jan. 31, Feb. 3 or Feb. 7 might be a
worthwhile experience.

The Panthers will travel to
‘Bloomsburg tomorrow afternoon
for a 2 p.m. match, and ‘will
probably have to do so without the
services of Stottlemyer, who is
nursing a bad back. But chances
are good that he’ll be there when
Pitt meets Millersville next Satur-
day, and because admission is free
to Pitt students, it would be fitting
.if Stottlemyer and his teammates
got the support they deserve.

knows that if it’s going for it all, it
has to win the “big one.” For
Pitt’s tankers, the “big one” may
be tonight when. they M face Kent
State at Trees Pool. ‘

“Kent State has an excellent
team,” said Pitt Coach Dick
Bradshaw.
distance swimmers are both
top-notch. This should be_a close
meet as well as avery good one.

“They might be the best team on

the record in the 100-meter
freestyle. Both re_cords were
disallowed because of discrepen-
cies in timing. But the thrill of an
opening victory against top-ranked
Princeton overshadows the mishap
for. Stetler.

“We were really psyched for that
meet for about a week,” she said.
The meet with the Tigers was
played just prior to the weekend's.
main_ event, the Pitt Invitational,

’which put a lot of strain, both

physically and mentally, on the
team. ‘ -

“We had prelims and ﬁnals at
the same time as the Invitational,
which really gets to you,” Stetler
related. “We were there from 9

. a.m. till late at night, and we had to

swim everything twice.”

Being a Pitt swimmer has its
rewards, like the Christmas vaca-
tion' in Puerto Rico that Stetler and
her teammates enjoyed, but
discipline and hard work are always
important. -

“It's hard work; anyone who

swims will admit it,” Stetler said.
V “But it’s time you want to" put,,in.

“lt’s hard, but you learn to

organize your time. and set your

priorities. Everythin_g‘“fall_s into
place, but you still get spastic at
times.’-’ - '

Stetler is looking". -"for an

undefeated season for her team,
with victories at the Easterns and
Nationals competitions. For her-
self, it’s the Olympics. H
Perhaps the best summation of
Stetler is by her coach, Kate

Mathison. _
“She’s the most outstanding
. swimmer I’ve ever coached, ”

Mathison said. “She not only has
the ability, she has the attitude to
accomplish a lot.”

1‘ ‘Their divers‘ and’

 

our schedule, so this might be the
key to an undefeated seaso'n.”.

Bradshaw’s praise is well-deser- _

ved. Kent State _is undefeated at
3-0, having beaten Western Michi-

gan, 63-SO, Eastern Michigan,
79-34, and Eastern Kentucky,
70-43. Kent State has taken 28

firsts and 15 seconds in 39 events.
It has a lot of talent in_both swiming
and diving- ' -

Rich Alexander is probably th
best performer, having notched a
4:57.3 performance in the 500-yard
freestyle and a 1:49.5 in the
200-yard freestyle.‘ He is the
Mid-American Conference record-
holder in the 1,650 freestyle.

John Ovisak and Dave, Watson
are other top returning swimmers.
Ovisak has a 22.2 in the S0-free,
and a 48.9 in the 10.0-free. Watson
is Kent’s top sprinter, and was a
key‘ factor. in Kent State’s_ three
relay victories. , ‘

Eric Ambler and Dave Wohl,
both of whom" are freshman, have
come on to do an excellent job.
Ambler, who Bradshaw thinks may
challenge Pitt’s Jerry DeMuro, has

done a 9:5.1.8 in the 1,000-yard’

‘v

200-yard individual medley.

Tom Sandercock is Kent State’s 

top diver, having notched a 263.95
in the one-meter dive.

Surprisingly, Coach Tod Boyle of-I ":9
Kent State feels that Pitt is vastly 

superior. .

“They have much better times  if

than we do. Our team isimuch

younger and we have less depth ‘ PM
than Pitt,” he said. “We’re a good *7
young team, but we’re a bit weak in :1"-
sprints, our -diving could be alittle ‘ J _
better and we’ve had a. ‘recent f I
illness problem. - 

“Pitt’s greater experience,’ 
depth, superior competition, con- 

ditioning and overall -ability should

make this meet impossible for us‘, '9‘.i'i5
but when you get two good teams, 
together, records mean little or

nothing, ’ ’ he added.

- So tonight at 6:30, it’s Kent State  C
(3-0) vs. Pitt (4-0). Boyle is right on’ " . .

Olympic Hopes Loom ‘

For Every Trackster   0

BY RALPH SPARKLE

Track, a little-known and highly
misunderstood sport, will be
receiving a lot of publicity in the

coming months for one good
reason: the ’76 Olympics.

In contrast to sports like football.

or baseball, track is a universal
sport. Conceived by the Greeks
thousands of years ago, it has
grown steadily in popularity. When
a runner has a good race, his time
can be compared to others locally,
_nationally and internationally.

Everyone knows just how good
his performance was.

In thepvback of his mind, every
runner dreams of going to the
Olympics. The Pitt runners are no
exception, especially after last
Saturday’s meet. , "

The distance corps of the Pitt

squad’ is ﬁlled with the, verysame.
talentthat led the =Pitt—c_'ross-count- -

ry team to the'NCAAs and an
undefeated dual-meet record.

The 1976 track team may well
have the perfect well-balanced
team. Senior Nick Martin is a top
competitor in the mile, having
posted a.4:05.7 in the event.

Mel Boyd, a promising sopho-
more, has a run two fine "races
already this year. Tom Herrmann
in the 1000—yard, Don Betterly in
the half mile, and world-class
sprinter Karl Farmer in the

600-yard events could make’ ianyvﬂ 4.

But the depth and talent doesinot‘

stop there. John‘ Heiser
