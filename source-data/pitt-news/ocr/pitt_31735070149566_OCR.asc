Gov. ‘Tom
  Corbett I
speaks at Pitt

By Pat McAteer
and Gretchen Andersen
- The Pitt News Staﬁ

In light of a $4.2 billion state bud-

get deﬁcit, Pennsylvania lawmak— I

ers had no choice other than to
make tough cuts, Pennsylvania
Gov. Tom Corbett told a tense au-
dience at Pitt Friday morning.

“I was elected to govern and
make tough decisions, and to be
here to answer your questions to-
day,” Corbett said as some audi-
ence members shook their heads
and a few shouted back. “I under-
stand that you are angry.”

Corbett spoke as part of one
of GPSA and SGB’s Breakfast
and Politics events to a crowd of
about 300 people that included
Pitt undergraduate and graduate
students, Pitt administrators and
community members.

The event started with a pan-
cake breakfast for attendees before
Corbett’s speech in the Assembly
Room at the William Pitt Union.
Corbett spoke for about 20 min-
utes, then answered pre-screened
questions for 25 minutes.

During the speech, Corbett
asked for universities to not in-
crease their tuition and added
that he’s looking for universities
to control their costs.

“Don’t raise tuition. Don’t raise
it on students and families. Find
some cuts. Obama isva Democrat
and I’m a Republican and we prob-
ably don’t agree on a lot of things,
but we do agree that the cost of
higher education has gotten out
of control. And it has to be con-
trolled,” Corbett said.

Pitt spokesman John Fedele
said in an email that Pitt Chancel-
lor Mark Nordenberg was grate-
ful that the governor visited and
expressed his position. Despite his
gratitude for the visit, Fedele said
Nordenberg opposes the cuts.

St. Patric’s Day Parade brings politicians

By Gretchen Andersen
Senior Staﬁ" Writer

Vice President Joe Biden was no
stranger to Pittsburgherson Satur-
day at the annual St. Patrick’s Day
Parade Downtown. He high-ﬁved
and shook an endless amount of
hands and kissed the cheeks of
babies and women while making
his way, sometimes running, down
Grant Street. , .

Taking his jacket off and roll-
ing up his sleeves, Biden — wear-
ing an emerald tie — was shortly
joined by Pittsburgh Mayor Luke
Ravenstahl and Allegheny County
Executive Rich Fitzgerald during
the beginning stretch of the parade
on Grant Street.

However, when turning onto
Boulevard of the Allies and en-
tering massive crowds along the
streets and in Stanwix Garage,
Biden, who is of Irish descent,
picked up speed and began run-
ning to both sides of the crowds
— some areas six people deep — in
a zigzag pattern alongside Secret

Service agents. _

“At ﬁrst he started walking from
side to side and was moving real
slowly, and then he took off and
started to sprint, at which point
I fell back a little bit. But he was
great with the crowd, they re-
sponded well to him,” Ravenstahl
said with a smile.

The vice president was met
with boos, applause and “Way to
go, Joe!” chants from the crowd
as the distant sound of bagpipes
ﬁlled the streets.

Biden joined about 200 march-
ing units, including 18 bands,
ﬂoats and several police, ﬁre and
emergency service agencies at the
St. Patrick’s Day parade. Accord-
ing to the parade’s press release,
the three-and-a—half-hour—long
march usually has about 150,000
to 200,000 spectators.

Thousands of Pittsburghers,
dressed in shorts and sandals for
the unseasonably warm weather,
stood by the streets as the light
breeze and glaring sun shone down
on the parade.

Sunkissed skin complement-

_ ed many faux orange beards and

painted faces. Parade-goers were
decked in green; some with dyed
hair, T—shirts that read “Kiss Me
I’m Irish” and leprechaun outﬁts.

Biden was not the only politi-
cian present at the parade. As the
second biggest St. Patrick’s Day Pa-
rade in the country with a 142—year
history, local politicians ﬂocked to
the parade, such as Ambassador
to_ Ireland Dan Rooney and Gov.
Tom Corbett.

Corbett, who visited Pitt’s cam-
pus'on Friday, waved to crowds
with his green Steelers hat and a
St. Patrick’s-themed Terrible Towel

. hanging from his pocket.

Joining in the parade behind
Biden after meeting him halfway

. through Grant Street were mem-

bers of Organizing for America
— campaign volunteers for the
re-election of Barack Obama. OFA ‘I
supporters had signs such as “Mr.
President, Your Care Made My
Health Affordable?" ‘
Jennifer Austin, Pennsylvania
press secretary for the Obama
campaign, said in an email that

in addition to handing out cam-
paign stickers and placards, OFA
registered voters and recruited
volunteers.

Biden later visited the CON SOL
Energy Center in the afternoon to
watch Syracuse, his alma mater,
play Kansas State in the 2012 NCAA
Basketball Tournament. V

“We are really happy [Biden]
was here, and Pennsylvania will be
an important state in the coming
election,” Ravenstahl said. ‘

Ravenstahl added that it was
great to see the 200,000-person
turnout and children lining the
street, making for a safe parade.

“This is a day where everybody
is Irish for a day, and that includes
the German Ravenstahls as well,”

Ravenstahl said.

Punxsutawney Phil enlivened
the crowd as he perched up in his
see-throughplaistic case in the
front of an SUV. Keith Shields,
a member of Phil’s Inner Circle,
a group of men that coordinate
Punxsutawney’s annual Ground-
hog’s Day festivities, walked along-

Hindu Student Council
holds Spring Garbo

Byjosh Won
Staﬂ" Writer

Leaping circles around the ball-
room in bright ﬂowing clothing,

’Pitt’s Hindu Students Council spent

Saturday at the O’Hara Student
Center performing Indian’ dances
to welcome the spring season.

The group’s annual Spring Gar-
ba was coupled with traditional
food and prayer. It served as an
appeal to the goddess Shakti ——
the embodiment of several Hindu
deities —' for a bountiful new sea-
son. .

According to Hindu Students
Council president Samyuktha Ravi,

Students perform Indian dances

garba is a religious Indian dance
from Gujarat, a state in western
India.

“It’s a celebration of the com-
ing spring dedicated to Shakti, the
goddess of fertility, health and new

life,” Ravi said of the event,_which
went from 5 to 10 p.m.

In line with Gujarat practice,
the group placed a table at the cen-
ter of the ballroom with pictures
o'fHindu goddesses, around which
students dressed in traditional
garb pranced. About 150 ‘people
attended the event.

“This is sari,” Ravi said, indicat-
ing her own garment, a deep blue
fabric adorned with shimmering
sequins. “It’s just a long piece of
cloth, fanned out in the front —
part of Gujarat fashion.”

On her brow was a small sticker,
called a tika, to protect the fore-
head, which is believed to be the
body’s most powerful energy

“The Pitt community remains
resolute that because of the enor-
mous contributions the Univer-
sity makes to the education of
Pennsylvanians, the economy of
Western Pennsylvania and beyond
and the creation of new knowl-
edge through our research agenda,
there should be no more cuts to the
University’s Commonwealth ap-
propriation, and that the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh should remain
public,” Fedele said.

Last year Pitt faced Corbett’s
proposed 50 percent state budget
cut before the state government
signed a 19 percent cut into law.
This year, the University faces a 30
percent proposed budget cut.

“The letter and intent of the
1966 legislation making Pitt a
state—related university is that the
University be permitted to increase
tuition to levels not covered by the
Commonwealth appropriation,”
Fedele said. “Over the last decade,

.the appropriation level has arrived

at a point that takes us to the lowest
level, adjusted for inﬂation, since
Pitt became a state—related uni-
versity 46 years ago. As a result,
the University has been forced to

raise tuition to cover a portion of

' the gap.”

James Landreneau, SGB Presi-
dent and moderator of the ques-
tion and answer session, said
that he believes the University is

making all the efforts necessary.

to curb costs.

“But its like everything else — if
you pull out of the piggy bank for
something, you are going to have to
raise something else,” Landreneau
said.

Because of these cuts, Pitt and
Penn State administration officials

have both discussed the possibility

of moving from state—related to
private institutions.

“I would be disappointed if [Pitt
and Penn State] had to [privatize],
but I would understand if they had
to do it,” Corbett said.

Nyasha Hungwe, GPSA presi-
dent, said he felt Corbett was “out
of touch” when answering the stu-

dents’ questions and speaking to-

the audience.

“One of the comments he made
that alarmed me was he was driv-
ing at the fact that we should be
private, and that we didn’t have
to be a public institution. I don’t
think he understands what that
[privatization] would actually do
for Western Pennsylvania and the
city of Pittsburgh,” Hungwe said.

Landreneau said although he

felt Pitt presented its case "well
against the cuts, he didn’t think it
impacted the governor to change
his mind. He said it was disheart-
ening to hear Corbett talk about
“understanding” if Pitt became
privatized.

“I think Pitt is such a strong-
hold name for the community and
provides tons of opportunities. I
think if it was privatized, that
would change the whole dynamic
of the city and Oakland area and
even the suburban setting,” Lan-
dreneau said.

Corbett insisted that he wasn’t
an opponent of higher education

_in the state. He noted that his

daughter is a graduate of Pitt’s Law
School, and that he used tolattend
football games at Pitt Stadium.
Corbett added that public edu-
cation.as a whole accounted for 40
percent ofthe state’s budget, while

38.9 percent goes to the Depart- 7

ment of Welfare and 7.3 percent
goes to Corrections/Probations
and Parole. 13.5 percent covers
all other areas of the budget.

He used visual aids such as bar
graphs and pie charts to_show how
the budget was divided. Corbett
frequently compared the state
budget to a pizza pie. _

‘fPennsylvania looks at educa-
tion as its number one priority,”

ed, pointing out a student in a long, tasseled
raiment that reached his knees.

As curious students unfamiliar with Hin-
duism entered the ballroom, dancers would
take them aside and show them common
steps to garba, so they could also join the
colorful procession around the table.

HSC member Raul Larsen, tired from the
vigorous dancing, took a seat and drank a
grape Crush.

“There’s no formalized step,” the sopho-
more said between slurps of soda. “It’s all
just taught, learned, and changed during
the dance. Someone just conﬁdently starts
[a dance pattern] and-others fol1ow.”

One of those conﬁdent leaders was junior
and economics major Anand Mahalingam,
president of Panther Raas, a competitive
team at Pitt that performs Indian dances
with the use of sticks.

Despite the fact that he needed a sling for
an injured shoulder, Mahalingam instructed
students and led processions around the
room. .

“A couple of people who were going to
come were late, so I had to start it,” he said.
“I tore a muscle in my shoulder  but I’ll
dance anyway. I love dancing.”

Following the dance came the singing of
a prayer called “Om]ai_]agdish.” The group
gave visitors sheets so they could read the
words, while the dancers passed around a
dish and danced through the crowd to the
beat of clapping hands.

“In the dish are electric candles and ﬂow-
ers,” Ravi said. “The lights [in the place of
ﬁre] represent purity, as in the purity of the

child. This is offered to all gods.”

After the prayer, as people ﬁled down-
stairs to eat north Indian-style dishes, some
stopped in front of the table and touched the
feet of the goddesses displayed, bowing their

heads with closed eyes.

“That’s to get a blessing,” Ravi said. “We
touch their feet to show humbleness.”

Then came raas dancing. Unlike garba,
raas incorporates the use of sticks.

“These are dandiya,” Larsen said of the
two decorated rods he twirled between his
ﬁngers. “I got them on Devon Street [in] Chi-
cago, which is known to be alittle India in the
U.S. They’re used exclusively for dance.”

As people in the processions leaped and
spun the dandiya, occasionally striking them
against their partners’ rods, Ravi outlined
the folklore behind their signiﬁcance.

“It’s supposed to represent a, goddess’
swords,” she said, referencing one of the dei-
ties on the table. Riding a lion and wielding
two blades, tradition holds that Amba Ma
killed a great beast terrorizing a village.-

Another legend has it that the dance pays
homage to the god Krishna, with the sticks
representing his ﬂute.

“We are dancing with [Krishna], so to‘

speak,” Ravi said. j

The night was concluded with Bhangra, a
more contemporary dance with music from
Bollywood ﬁlms. With intense movements
and fast—paced dancing, dancers exhaus-
tively twisted to the lively music. ‘

Mahalingam said he believes that the
culture that events like the Spring Garba
bring are of great value.

“For those people who want to explore .

different cultures, it’s a great opportunity.
We love for everyone to join. We’ll show
you the footwork and arm movements," he
said.  '

Corbett said in regard to the fact that educa-
tion accounted for the largest portion of the
state budget. “When the pizza pie goes from
an 8-inch pie to a 6-inch pie, you still have
that percentage, but not enough money.”

Corbett’s budget calls for 30 percent cuts
in funding toward public colleges in the state
of Pennsylvania. Pitt, a state—related uni-
versity that receives partial funding from
the state, would receive $95.2 million in
state funding, down from the $136 million
it received from the state this year.

When facing an economic crisis of the
magnitude currently faced by the state of
Pennsylvania, Corbett said raising taxes
wasn’t an option. He added that in order
for the state to make up the deﬁcit, income
taxes would need to be raised by an average
of $920 per family. V

Corbett said that in the two years prior
to his election as governor, Pennsylvania
received suppl€mental' funding from the
federal stimulus package that went directly
into the state budget. He said that during
those two years, state funding toward educa-
tion actually decreased. He added that dur-
ing his administration, funding for higher
education reﬂected that of the 2008 state
budget. --

In addition to the increased cuts of higher
education, Corbett said the increasing costs
of pension plans for state employees added

 

separate funding issues forthe state. He 
the current state budget allocates $1.6 bil-

lion toward state employee pension plans,

with _costs expected torise to $4.2 billion
bythe 2016-2017 ﬁscal year.

it “This isn’t because, I like you or don’t
like you,” Corbett said in regard to the state
budget. “This is because these are the num-
bers.”

During the question and answer session,
Corbett brieﬂy addressed a question regard—
ing House Bill 934, the Photo Voter ID bill,
which he signed into law Wednesday. The
Photo Voter ID bill requires Pennsylvanians
to show valid government—issued photo ID
before they vote at the polls, starting this
November.

“A million dollars have been set aside if
necessary,” Corbett said. “I don’t believe it
is a disenfranchisement to show who you
are.”

Robert Beecher, chairperson of SGB’s
Governmental Relations Committee, said
he thought Corbett seemed composed while

. delivering his prepared portion of the pre-

sentation, but struggled with the question
and answer session.

“His main weakness was his inability
to respond to student questions,” Beecher

said. “He was unresponsive to many of the

questions.”

Beecher said in particular, Corbett at- _

tempted to talk around a question posed
by Hungwe regarding the disproportionate
nature of the cuts toward Pitt in relation to
other public universities in the state.

in/er“:eity threateneti
, her Christian Club

Corbett said he did not know the answer

I to the question, and would have to talk to

his budget secretary.

Pitt’s Dean of Students Kathy Humphrey
said she was impressed with the students’
questions. '

“In general, I was pleased with the stu-
dents,” Humphrey said. “They brought real
facts for the governor to consider. I thought
the questions were well thought out. I hope
this will encourage the governor to recon-
sider his [budget] proposal.”

After speaking to Pitt students in the
William Pitt Union, Corbett toured the Swan-
son School of Engineering and the Center
for Energy. Fedele said the tour featured
presentations by professors and students
on thermo—electric generation and a smart
grid simulation, among others.

Before the event started, about 30 pro-

» testers carrying signs with slogans such as

“Hey you billionaires, pay your fair share,”
were told to leave the William Pitt Union
by Pitt Police.

Before the governor tookthe stage, Nor-
denberg asked for a moment of silence for
the victims of the Western Psychiatric In-
stitute shooting last week.

Hungwe said the turnout was “awesome”
and that “there wasn’t as much ruckus as we
had expected or feared.” After the speech,
Hungwe went up to Corbett before he exited
the William Pitt Union. “I asked him if he
would come back next year, and he.kind of
gave me a half-yes, so hopefully he comes
back,” Hungwe said. I

He said they came out to the parade be-
cause “everyone loves to see Phil.”

“It’s great to see all the people and the
reception. It’s a beautiful day,” Shields, the
Head Hailmaker, said.

I Several Irish dance schools entertained
parade—goers with their sparkling uniforms,
bouncing hair and footwork.

Katie Conlon, 18, Butler County, danced
with several others on the Bell School of Irish
Dance ﬂoat. Conlon, who wore an intricate
blue sequined Irish dance dress that she de-
signed herself, s-aid she has been dancing in
the parade for about 10 years and enjoys the
experience.

“I love doing the parade every year and its
deﬁnitely different being up there,” Conlon
said. “As my teacher said, ‘we are the face of
Bell School,’ so it’s a lot of waving and a lot
of smiling and a lot of ﬁm.” .

City ﬁreﬁghter Pete Soergel marched in
the parade playing the bagpipes with the
ﬁreﬁghters.

Soergel said the St. Patrick’s Day Parade
is his favorite parade of the year and has
marched in it for the last 10 years.

“When you come up here, down the Bou-
levard of the Allies and you get in line with
the parking garage there is lots of people
cheering for you, and it’s really cool,” So-
ergel said. I

The nebulousness o

  
  
  
 
  

By Mark Kozlowski
Columnist

What does it mean to be an educated
person? 4

There used to be a very good
answer to this ‘question. Educa-
tion in the West meant that you
had read the classics, knew some
Latin and Greek, were well-versed
in Christian theology and appreci-
ated the “right” kinds of artwork.
Logic, rhetoric, literature, ‘geogra-
phy and geometry were also parts
of the curriculum. Read old books or

articles written for an educated au- ‘

dience and you’ll see what I’m talk-
ing about: They’ll feature random
untranslated passages in French
or Latin because they assume the
reader knows what they mean. I’d
consider myself reasonably edu-
cated, and I’m deﬁnitely confused
by these quotes. When faced with
this situation, I ask, “What’s my
education really worth, and what
does being an educated person
mean today?” .

The concept of being educated
is now fuzzy to the point where it’s
hard to assume an educated per-
son knows anything at all. Even the

f on ‘education’

Have,» you‘, done anything‘. with your
life besides watching TV?

It’s cheaper than earning.
, a liberal arts degree,,
and the job market’s the same.

  
 

concept of a solid" liberal arts edu-
cation encompasses a much larger
potential curriculum. At Pitt, your
educationls liberal enough if you’ve
read a little Descartes, know enough
foreign language to pass high school
exams, took a course on children’s
literature, a course on history and
enoughgforeign culture classes to
realize thatjapan and China are not
the same country. It’s possible to
graduate from Pitt after taking any
number of different courses. .It’s im-

possible to say “a Pitt graduate will

know this list of things.”

There are several reasons that .
I we’ve lost a clear sense of what

constitutes an education. First,
the classic liberal arts curriculum
focused on things that were over~
whelmingly old, dead, white and
male — things currently seen as

. so yesterday, so lifeless, so racist

and so‘ sexist. The onward march
of technology created the need for
studying the one thing that a clas-

_ sical education largely ignored: the

natural sciences. In fact, MIT was
founded speciﬁcally to counteract
this tendency. More emphasis on
the STEM ﬁelds meant that there
was less time and space for memo-
rizing the Aeneid. '

 

Illustratioh by Mike Rosenthal

We also need to know more in
this day and age than we once did.
It is absolutely necessary to have
basic literacy in computers, which
didn’t exist 100 years ago. Some
skills that were once vital, such as
the use of a log table, are now obso-
lete. A language like French might
have lots of panache, but something
like Chinese, Spanish or Brazilian
Portuguese is probably more useful.
The ﬁmction of education is differ-
ent. While it used to be something

that gave a gentleman that extra bit '

of polish and admitted him into the
Reform Club, it’s now a means to the

, end of gainful employment. Finally,

we live in a very specialized culture
and environment, where being the
best at a particular narrow subject
is more marketable than being rea-
sonably good at a lot of things.

“ The changing deﬁnition of an
education is both good and bad.
It’sgood in that our educations are
more open—ended_ and allow for
the study of interesting problems
that used to be considered unwor-
thy. And in this I include not only
subjects some people might ﬁnd
irrelevant, like Uzbek agricultural
policy, but also other subjects that

few people probably would, like
chemistry, which was once con-
sidered little more than a hobby of
eccentrics and cranks. _
However, there’s a very real
disadvantage to not having a com-
monly accepted deﬁnition of an
education. There’s the problem of
lacking a common culture, which
means the need to appeal to the
lowest common denominator in
both humor and drama becomes
even more acute. Education can also
be used as a kind of shorthand; it
allows you to make your point by
analogy to something everybody
knows rather than having to explain
everything ipso facto ad nauseam ab
initio. Since we’ve lost this common

jargon, we’ve lost the ability to use .

9

this kind of shorthand. We’re also
less able to appreciate each other’s
contributions, which can exacerbate
the divide between the humanities
types that think those in the scienc__-_
es are a bunch of narrow-minded
geeks and the sciences types who
think that those in the humanities
have mushy brains and only study
English to avoid worthy subjects like

I Physics. Finally, there's the problem

of degree inﬂation. Everybody now‘
has a degree, and nobody knows
what that degree means anymore,
which makes it less valuable.

To ameliorate those disadvantag-
es, we need to move towards a new
deﬁnition of education. However,

. because there are more institutions

trying to provide an education, this
is going to be much more diﬂicult
than in the days when Oxbridge was
able to set the standard. I ,

Enough is enough.

The bomb threat and campus
evacuations last Wednesday might
have actually convinced some stu-
dents it was ﬁnals week. I under-
stand that those pesky term pa-
pers and midterms interfere with
porch drinking and eating Razzy
Fresh, but threatening to blow up
a building to avoid a communica-
tio ns exam’isn’t exactly a Bond ﬁlm-
worthy scheme.

Instead of wasting your time
committing felonies, consider this
list of equally classy, slightly more

legal, but still unethical strategies -

for avoiding classes.

Lie . s

The old “dog ate my homework’?
excuse won’t cut it anymore —— col-

trategies for avoiding class the

lege is the big leagues, ‘where you
have to spin your lies faster than
your professor when he told you
attendance was mandatory. I tend
to subscribe to the notion that the
bigger the lie, the more likely your
professor is to believe it because of

— its sheer ridiculousness. Try saying

that you had to cut class because the
police detained you and questioned
you about the recent bomb threats
or that you were attacked by a pack
of angry Pitt fans when they saw
your Oakland Zoo shirt. Hopefully
your professor’s sheer surprise or
respect for your creativity will con-

‘ Vince him to grant you an extension

on your paper.

Enjoy the Weather

What’s the point of going to a
class when it’s so nice out? Pick up
a book or a Cosmo and go outside!
Grab a case of Natty and play beer
pong on your porch! The sun is only

here for so long, and you can ﬁnish
studying afteryour buzz dies down
or when you’re no longer blacked
out. You’re just working on your tan

. and "socializing with your friends,

bro; college is as much about living
large as it is about graduating.
Bribe Your Professor

Never underestimate the power

of a bribe. Talk to your teacher and
ﬁgure out their likes and dislikes.
Try baking a cake or some cookies.
Don’t be afraid to get creative and
make baked goods with a theme
relevant to the class: Mitochondria

cookies for biology professors and -

inkblot brownies for psychology
professors are guaranteed hits. To
those of you that are of age, ask
your professor out for a drink and
casually mention at the bar that you
need an extension. '

Request a Personal Day

just come right out and tell your

miiimiaipoiiciesl

professor that you needed to take
“a day for yourself,”, without ex-
plaining what that entails. Most of
them will be so taken aback by your
honesty that they’ll give you an ex-
tension. In fact, it might even make

‘ them feel bad if you imply that their

class is the reason you needed some
time to clear your head. You might
help your fellow students out by

_ being irresponsible, you do-gooder.

Just write a quick email 15 minutes
before class saying you “can’t take
the pressure” and “need some time
off” to gather your thoughts and
then BAM! You’re back in front of
your television playing video game
or sleeping! '
Honesty '
Your mom prepared you for this
when she said that honesty is the
best policy. Surprise the profes-
sor with your bluntness, saying,
“Look, dude, I was going to come,

advertising@pittnews.com

t won't incur a prison sentence ,

but you’re just really boring, and
I’d probably fall asleep or text and
I didn’t want to be a distraction or
waste your time grading my exam

. so I just thought I’d save you the

trouble.” This will place the pro-
fessor in your debt, as you did him
a solid by saving him from grad-
ing your mediocre work. Don’t be
afraid to call this favor in on the
ﬁnal by writing “I know I failed, but
come on, bro, rememberl skipped
the midterm for you.”

Try not to abuse these methods
—- if you use them more than six to
10 times per week you aren’t likely to

I gain many credits this semester. But

hey, at least you don’t have to explain
to your ﬁiture employers that you
got kicked out of school because you
would rather call in a bomb threat
than take a midterm. l

Pitt to face Penn in CBI quarterfinals «I

By Brian Batko
Stajf Writer

The Pitt men’s basketball team
has outlasted national powers like
_ Duke and Missouri, as well as rival
" ‘West Virginia, this March thanks
to a wild ﬁrst round in the NCAA
Tournament.

Of course, the Panthers are par-
ticipating in the College Basketball
Invitational rather than the Big

2 Dance, and they will take on the
Princeton Tigers (20-11, 10-4 Ivy
League) in a quarterﬁnal matchup
tonight at the Petersen Events Cen-
ter.

Given all its struggles this sea-
son, Pitt might not have much in
common with many of the teams

still alive in the postseason, but it.
does share one important similar-

ity: the goal of extending its sea-
son as deep into March as possible.
Princeton, though, riding a ﬁve-
’“' game win streak and victorious in
nine of its last 10 games, is far from

an Ivy League doormat.
The Tigers were an NCAA Tour-

nament team a year ago and nearly
upset eventual Final Four partici-
pant Kentucky in the round of 64.
First—year head coach Mitch Hen-
derson’s club returned all but two
contributors from last season’s Ivy
League championship team in 2011-
2012 but ﬁnished third in the con-
ference this year behind Harvard
and Penn, two teams the Tigers split
head—to-head matchups with in the
regular season.

Senior guard Douglas Davis, the
Tigers’ second—leading scorer be-
hind junior big man Ian Hummer,
led the way with 31 points in the
team’s 95-86 victory over Evansville
in the ﬁrst round of the tournament
last Tuesday.

“We didn’t want to end just yet.
We wanted to get a win in the post-
season and we did that,” Davis said
after his scoring outburst Tuesday
night." “Now we want to keep this
run going.”

The Panthers hope to do the
same as they showed in their 81-
63 win on Wednesday against Wot-
ford.J.]. Moore and Travon Woodall
were among the ﬁve players to score

double ﬁgures against the Terriers,

‘ pacing the Panthers with 16 points

apiece. .
“The fans were behind me. The
true_fans were there, they had our
back. I showed them that this is
what Pitt is about,” Moore said after
the Wofford win in reference to the
sparse attendance. The 1,449 fans
in attendance were the fewest for a
Pitt home game since the Petersen
Events Center opened in 2002.
But sophomore forward Lamar
Patterson made it clear Wednes-
day that the ultimate goal for the

Panthers’ CBI experience is simple:

get better.

“We are looking to buildtmo—
mentum going into the off—season
and working hard,” Patterson said.
“The extra games are great. We get
extra practice time with the team
and more coaching from Coach
Dixon and the rest of the staff. It’s
great right now.”

Head coachjamie Dixon was also
pleased with the Panthers’ perfor-
mance against Wofford, especially
given the strange and disappointing

Senior Tyler Nauman and ju-

nior Matt Wilps earned All-Amer-
ican status as the Pitt wrestling
team placed 15th atthe NCAA
Championships this weekend,
its best ﬁnish since taking 13th
in 1989.

It’s the ﬁrst time since 2007
that two Panthers earned a spot
on the podium at nationals.

Nauman, who earned the sixth
seed in the tournament at 149
pounds, won his ﬁrst three match-
es with relative ease in the national
tournament. His 9-5 decision win
over No. 3 Cole Vonohlen of the
U.S. Air Force Academy placed him
into the semiﬁnals and earned him

All-American status as a top-eight

ﬁnisher.‘

“It is a huge relief to have
earned All-American status for
the second time,” Nauman said.
“I really wanted to get back on the

podium this year.”

After defeating VonOhlen,
Nauman matched up against No.
6 Dylan Ness of Minnesota for a

. chance at the ﬁnals. He got down

early in the match but recovered
to tie it at 5-5 late in the third pe-
riod. V

Ness had over a minute of rid-
ing time, so he was assured the
game-winning point if Nauman
couldn’t come through with a tilt.
Nauman’s attempt to earn back
points failed, and he fell out of the
running for the national champi-
onship.

“I wish I would have ot to
my offense faster in the semis,”
Nauman said. “That would have
allowed me to wrestle my match.
Instead, I got behind and had to
try to come back, which Iwas able
to do, but not enough.”

Nauman lost his ﬁrst match
in the wrestleback portion of
the bracket, giving him a chance
at third place. This put him in a

On a brisk December night in 1983,
Juliane Brossman, a high school
student on the New Jersey Wave
swim club, dove in to a 13-year-old,
still state—of-the—art Trees Pool for
the 1000 freestyle.

In‘ a time before Dana Torres’
ﬁrst Olympic race with NASA-
developed swim suits, Brossman
made her mark. She leveled her
competition in the unforgiving
40-length race, posting 9:44.62
and setting a pool record.

In addition to being the old-
est record still standing at Trees,
Brossman’s mark was one of just
ﬁve records to survive the Big East
Championship meet held in Trees
Pool on Pitt’s campus a little over
a month ago.

The records for the men’s and-

women’s 1000 freestyle and 50

Staﬂ” Writer

I have a1ove—hate relationship with NCAA
Tournament brackets.

I enjoy the process of ﬁlling them out. I
like debating the teams’ merit, looking at
matchups, completely overlooking the mid-
majors that are going _to ruin my chances of
winning my bracket pooli—- I’m looking at

. you, Virginia Commonwealth University

and Butler —— and ultimately deciding which
teams will end up in the Final Four.

After ﬁlling out « ’
brackets for the 2
past ﬁve years and
coming nowhere '
close‘ to correctly
predicting the last
two teams standing,

I have adjusted my
expectations in the
hopes of lessening
the hurt that comes

bracket’s chronic
ineptitude.

Once the tourna-
ment starts, a funny

made it all theﬂway to the Final Four. When

No. 12 seed VCU lost to Indiana on Saturday,
- I felt no pity for the Rams. ’

Filling out a bracket provides short-term
gratiﬁcation, but the allure of this gratiﬁca-
tion is strong. Is the attraction of predicting
the NCAA Tournament simply the bracket
itself? The online sports and culture web-
site Grantland provides some evidence for
this theory. ~

The site has put together brackets for
topics ranging from the best Wire charac-
ter to the best soup. ‘It held voting on its

Facebook page, and the public responded

well. -

For those interest-

ed, Omar Little won

and New England

ﬁrst weekend, I sink into a mild depression
until the Sweet Sixteen. After that, I’m'not
really mad that I have failed once again and
go on to enjoy the rest of the tournament

even more than I did those ‘first four days. 2

by I enjoy watching the improbable occur
during these two and a half weeks. Even
casual fans can get caught upin the craziness
of the NCAA»Tournament, and the ability to
captivate gives March Madness an advantage
over other postseason events, such as the

, college football bowl season.

But at the same time, those same casual
fans can ﬁll out an entire bracket purely
based on the schools’ mascotsand have
more success than me.

I’ve only won a pool once, during my -

junior year of high school. I can’t even re-
member my Final Four picks for 2010-2011,
but I know I didn’t pick Butler. Even in the
year when I won, I didn’t pick the right mid-
major. I

I haven’t forgotten that.

My general mistrust of mid-majors hasn’t
wavered, but I still tend to gamble on the
small schools. "V V

I trust my intuition, but, when it comes to
brackets, my intuition apparently shouldn’t
be trusted.

- Last year, VCU — a No. 11 seed that

Challenge, and that-

participation hints at_something bigger.
What about when you factor in the par-
ticipation numbers of other online sites

that hold bracket contests, such as Yahoo.

and CBSSports? Countless ofﬁce, ﬂoor and

' dorm pools show that the bracket epidemic

has a far reach.

‘ The number of participants is tremen-
dous without even counting people who ﬁll
out multiple brackets. Thosepeople are the

- cause of a solid portion of my bitterness over

the recurring failure of my own bracket.

Seeing how your picks fare is part of the
fun, of March Madness, and isn’t that fun
diminished when one of your brackets does
better thananother, and you’re never really
wrong? There’s no risk involved that way.

Is this approach childish and petty?
Without a doubt. But that still doesn’t make
it acceptable for you to ﬁll out ﬁve different
brackets and celebrate wildly when one of
those ﬁve wins a pool or has the correct
National _Champion.

You all know who you are.

Now, I’m going to go bemoan the fate of
my bracket, which currently sits in the 11.3
percentile on ESPN’s Tournament Challenge,

WRESTLING

match with familiar foejustin Accordino of
Hofstra. A tight 4-3 decision over Accordino
placed Nauman ﬁfth on the podium.

“I feel I wrestled a good tournament,”
Nauman said. “A little less than I would have
liked, but overall I wrestled well.”

The senior 149-pound wrestler’s career
comes to an end at Pitt with a ﬁnal season
record of 30-6, earning his second All-
American ﬁnish. His career record of 140-31
places him third on the all-time wins list at
Pitt with 39 falls, also third all-time.

Wilps entered the tournament as the
third seed. The junior 197-pounder won
his ﬁrst two matches easily with decisions
of 7-3 and 11-6. '

He then matched up with sixth-seed
Brent Haynes of Missouri, and the two
wrestled to a tie through the regulation. In
overtime, Wilps pinned the Tigers’ wrestler
to earn his ﬁrst All-American status and a
trip to the semiﬁnals.

In the semiﬁnals, he met a familiar op-
ponent in second—seeded Chris Honeycutt,
who had defeated Wilps twice this season
before Wilps’ upset of the Edinboro wrestler
in the EWL championships. Once again,
Wilps found himself in overtime tied at 3-3.
This time, Honeycutt was able to earn two
back points after his escape in his period
on the bottom and held on to his three-
point lead.

After falling into wrestlebacks, Wilps
won his ﬁrst match to advance to the third-
place match. With third place on the line, he
fell to ﬁfth—seeded Cayle Byers of Oklahoma
State, 3-2.

Wilps returns next year with a chance to
be the_t0p—ranked wrestler at the beginning
of the season. '

At the two lowest weight classes, 125
pounds and 133 pounds, Pitt’s wrestlers
came one match short of All-American
status. ‘ .

Junior Anthony Zanetta lost 6-3 to Frank
Perrelli of Cornell in the quarterﬁnals. He
then went on to lose 10-4 in overtime to
Hofstra’s Steve Bonanno, who was seeded
12th, after jumping out to a 4-1 lead.

“Being one match away from All-Amer-
ican just helps me realize how bad I want
it,” Zanetta said. “There’s always room
for improvement. When you think you’ve
wrestled your best, you’re wrong. You can
always do better, and that’s what I need to
expect out of myself.”

Zanetta will look to return to the NCAA
Tournament for a fourth time next year to
compete for his ﬁrst All-American status.

Shelton Mack fell in his second match
but fought back for two wins in wrestle-
backs to put him in a one-match position
to earn All-American status. He. lost a 6-1
decision to tenth-seeded Chris Dardanes
of Minnesota.

“Being so close to being an All-American
lights a ﬁre for me,” Mack said. “It lets me
know what I need to do to be in the same

Piiii §AY3Ai‘iEIK .

position and become an All-American next
year.”

Mack said he also enjoyed the atmo-
sphere of the three-day tournament in St.
Louis. -

“Being able to witness, let alone be a
part of [the atmosphere], gave me a ton of
experience in itself.”

Senior Ethan Headlee went 2-2 for the
Panthers. It was Headlee’s fourth trip to the
national tournament.

Surprise NCAA qualiﬁer P.J. Tasser went
0-2 at the national championships as a
heavyweight, but was hampered by a knee
injury that he suffered in his ﬁrst match.

“You never want to make excuses,” Tass-
er said. “Hurting my knee certainly didn’t
stack the chips in my favor, however.”

While many programs across the nation
would be thrilled to have two All-Americans,
the Pitt wrestling team wanted more.

“I think two All—Americans, as a team,
is very disappointing and unacceptable in
a way,” Zanetta said.

Tasser also turned to the fact that the
Panthers were very close to having more
All-Americans as a reason for their dis-
appointment, despite the fact that they
turned in the best performance by a Pitt
wrestling team at the national tournament
in 23 years.

“As a team, two All—Americans is a great
accomplishment, but we were so ‘close to
having four or ﬁve of them,” Tasser said.

“It ‘deﬁnitely lights a fire for next
year.” i »

situation the team ﬁnds itself in. Playing in,

front of crowds of less than 2,000 people in '

games that aren’t even televised is uncharted
territory for a Pitt program that hasn’t missed

. the NCAA Tournament since the 2000-2001

campaign.
“We anticipated getting into the NIT and

then when we weren’t, we found ourselves in’

the situation we’re in,” Dixon said Wednesday
night. “It’s been tough on our guys, but they
wanted to play and I was eager to see how they
would come out. We came out and defended
well and we shot and passed the ball well and
we were unselﬁsh,‘ and that says a lot about
our guys.”

The Panthers recorded 20 assists on 33 ﬁeld
goals and turned the ball over just six times,
tying a season low in that department.

Princeton has only faced a team from
the Big East one time this season, securing
a 59-57 victory over Rutgers in December?
Tonight’s showdown between the Panthers
and the Tigers will be just the fourth all-time
meetingbetween the two teams and ﬁrst since
1962. Pitt holds a 2-1 advantage in the all-time
series. 3

A win for the Panthers will set up a semi-
ﬁnal matchup Wednesday night with either
Penn, which fell to Pitt earlier this season, or
Butler, the team that eliminated the Panthers
in the NCAA Tournament last year in a con-
troversial ﬁnish. j

from its ﬁfth place ﬁnish last year to take
fourth out of 11 teams. They edged out the
Villanova women by seven points with a
score of 375.5 to 368.5 and ﬁnished behind
Louisville (758.5), Notre Dame (593.5), and
West Virginia (524). ‘

“It says something to have a winning re-
cord for both teams,” Pitt head coach Chuck
Knoles said. “We’re competitive in our meets,
and we’re really looking forward to building
up for our competition in the ACC. I was re-
ally proud of our team at champs. We really
performed well and had some great times.
We set a bunch of team records.”

The women had a split record, 1-1, against
West Virginia this season, posting a com-

_ manding 60-point win over the Mountain-

eers in the Pitt Invitational in November but
falling short in Morgantown injanuary. The
Panthers’ other two in—conference losses
stemmed from back—to—back meets against
Big East titans Notre Dame and Louisville.

“I think this was the best we’ve done [at
champs] since I’ve been at Pitt. 1 think we
had a lot more depth than we’ve had in previ-
ous years,” Herbst said. “Overall, we’re very
proud_of our record this season.”

The men only lost to two in-conference
teams, Notre Dame and Louisville.

With the Big East Championship over,
the season is mostly ﬁnished. None of the
Panther swimmers recorded NCAA ‘A’ cuts
that would have guaranteed them a spot in
the NCAA championship meet, and none of
the swimmers with ‘B’ cuts were invited.

Pitt junior Maczewski attended the East-
ern College Athletic Conference Champion-
ship meet in late February in an effort to
secure an ‘A’ cut, but his 100 backstroke was
still just over a second short of the 46.28
needed to reach the cut. He did end up secur-
ing a ‘B’ cut and breaking the ECAC record
he set the previous year with a 47.51.

“It turns out Adam was sick, and we didn’t
even know it,” said Knoles. “He swam faster
in the morning of ECACS than he did in the
morning at Big East Champs, but couldn’t
go any faster in the evening. We drove back
to Pittsburgh, and it turned out he had an
inner ear infection. So, all things consid-
ered, I thought that was a great performance
from him.” ’ A

Most recently, three Panther divers went
on to perform in the NCAA zones diving meet
March 9 through 11. Sophomore Aaron Sny-
der took 28th and 36th in the men’s_1—meter
and 3-meter dives, respectively. Freshman
Angelika McGhee earned a trip to consola-
tion ﬁnals and ended with a 13th-place ﬁnish
in the women’s 1—meter dive. She also took
20th in the women’s 3-meter. Teammate
Leigh Waltz placed 23rd and 26th in the 1-
and 3-meter dives, respectively.

The last two big meets this season are the
Canadian Olympic Trials and the Indianapo-
lis Grand Prix, which will both take place
between March 27 through April 1.

The Panthers will send ﬁve athletes to the
Grand Prix to compete for Olympic trial cuts
and another three to the Canadian Olympic
Trials to compete for a spot on the Canadian
Olympic team for this summer’s Olympics

in London. i
