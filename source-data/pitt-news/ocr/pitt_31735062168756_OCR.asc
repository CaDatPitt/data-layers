SG Candidates Debate
Literature Distribution
In Men’s Dormitories

by LINDA GOLDSTEIN

The issue of distribution of
literature in the men’s dormi-
tories was discussed by ARA
presidential nominee Ken Fred-
erick and PPP presidential can-
didate John Ruskay during a de-
bate broadcast over radio station
WPGH Tuesday evening.

Replying ‘to a question tele-
phoned in by a listener, Freder-
ick discussed his philosophy on
“freedom of expression and dis-
tribution of literature in the
men’s dorms.”

“I feel very strongly about
freedom of expression,” he an-
swered. “As you know, there is
a dichotemy here, however, for
we must consider invasion of

privacy. We believe it is up to"

the students in the dormitories
to decide themselves whether
they wish to have literature dis-
tributed under their Tower dor-
mitory doors. Tom Meisner sus-

-pened the rules for one month

and allowed literature to be dis-
tributed under the dormitory
doors.”

Frederick felt that the one

month suspension was “a chance

 

I 5'neg1 '1‘:

to allow students to make up
their own minds, to allow some
sort of a dialogue, as we’ve heard
in the past, between students
and the decision-making body.”
Dealing with the opposition to
this move, Frederick continued,
“However, others did not believe.

I this. They formed an ad hoc

committee and demanded that
rules be suspended forever. Tom
and I were able to work out a
compromise. We found it was
possible_to allow literature to be
distributed through the mail-
boxes. Thus, the men in the dor-
mitories can have literature dis-
tributed to them, but their study-
ing area will not be disturbed.”

Frederick discussed the reac-
tion of the men in the dorm fol-
lowing the one-month suspension
period: “The men in the dorms

overwhelmingly said they did not
want the rules revoked and they
wanted no literature distributed
underneath their dormitory doors.
This is where the real dialogue

‘between the students and the

people that are representing them
came into effect. Tom represent-
ed what the students really want-
ed.”

Following Fredei-ick’s answer,
Ruskay explained his view on dis-

tribution of literature in the men’s I

do-rms: “Approximately one year
ago, preceding the Student Gov-
ernment (SG) election of last
year, the rules were introduced
limiting distribution of literature
in the Towers. There was a great
deal of controversy at that time
and after the SG election there
was a great deal of discussion in
many segments of the University
about how we could begin to get

a dialogue going.”

Ruskay recalled the course of
action last year: “We, that is,
many students throught the Uni-
versity community and many
members of the faculty, went to
the Men’s Dormitory Council
(MDC), the executive committee
of MDC, the Dean of Men, the
Dean of Women, and the Vice-
Chancellor for Student Affairs.
We went to faculty committee,
we spoke with them and said,
‘What would be the best thing,
what should be the right of stu-
dents in this vital area?”’

He added that “everyone agreed I

that freedom of expression should
be maintained, that the least
amount of limitation should exist.
However, we must provide for

the question of privacy and se-‘

curity in the dorms.” Ruskay
then explained the course taken
by the committee that was form-
ed and questioned, ‘fWhy did it
take 12 months to reach a solu-
tion that was very, very obvi-
ous (distribution through mail-
boxes)?”

DID Fraternity Joins

The Delta Iota Delta (DID)
Chapter at the University plans
to join the national Kappa Sigma
fraternity officially the week of
Jan. 23. Associate Dean of Men
Parker Enwright initiated the
contact last April. The new Kap-
pa Sigma’s will revive an old
charter, Gamma Omega, which
was abolished in 1941. Alumni

have also encouraged this renew-
al of the defunct chapter. Kappa
Sigma now has approximately
140 national chapters; ‘ ' -

Air Force Academy Prof

To Take Comand in June

By FRED FRANK

An Air Force Colonel and
a former Rhodes Scholar has
officially? been designated the
next Chancellor of the Uni-
versity. The Board of Trus-
tees announced that Dr.
Wesley W. Posvar, 41, who
is chairman of the Social
Sciences Division at the Air
Force Academy, will become
the University’s 15th Chan-
cellor on June 1 this year.

At the same time, the Board
announced the appointment of

‘Acting Chancellor Dr. David H. ,
Kurtzman to the full rank of '

Chancellor, to serve until Dr.
Posvar’s arrival on campus this
summer, and subsequently to be-
come Chancellor Emeritus and a
senior advisor to the Chancellor
with speciﬁc responsibilities in
the areas of Commonwealth Re-
lationships and ﬁscal policies.

Dr. Posvar’s appointment was
predicted in Wednesday’s edition
of the Pitt News and this week
the United Press International
had termed him the ‘fleading
contender” for the post.

A recipient of ﬁve academic‘
degrees, Dr. Posvar graduated
ﬁrst in his class from the U. S.
Military Academy at West Point
in 1946, achieving one of the
highest grades in the Academy's
history in the largest class (875
men) ever graduated from that
institution. He subsequently was
a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford Uni-
versity in England from 19-48 to
1951, receiving both the BA. and
M.A. in philosophy, politics and
economics. He earned the master
of public administration and the
Ph.D. in political science from
Harvard University in 1964.

He was the ﬁrst Air Force offi-
cer to win a Rhodes Scholarship,
and the youngest full professor
at the Air Force Academy when
he was appointed to head the
political science department there
in 1957, a post which he still
holds in addition to the chair-
mariship of the Social Sciences
Division. In 1959, he was named
one of the Ten Outstanding Young
Men in the U. S. by the Junior
Chamber of Commerce. His schol-
arly interests in the ﬁeld of po-
litical science are international
politics, political theory, ' decision-
making methodology, systems ana-
lysis, annd arms control and dis-
arament.

William H. Rea, ﬁnal arrange-

Li L Do They Exist?

. x

' THERE IS a crisis in the
University. That crisis 1s be-
ing accentuated in the cur-
rent issues being discussed
in the Student Government
’ elections.

It is not a crisis concern-
ing one speciﬁc issue, nor
has the crisis arisen spon-
taneously. Instead, it is a
crisis inherent in the estab-
‘lishment on this campus.

The core of the problem
is the contrast between the
ideal meaning of a university
with what exists in fact.

A UNIVERSITY consists
of these arms—-administra-
stors, faculty, and students.
When one segment makes a
decision, it must be cogni-
zant of what effect it will
have on the others. Because
A of the interdependency of all
three segments, each must
participate in decision-mak-
ing'——not as experts but as
barometers of opinion.

Such a system is not hope-
less idealism. It is a goal to-
_ wards which action should
‘ be -directed. It is also a goal
recognized as of utmost im-
portance by one of the lead-
ing educators in the country,
James Perkins, the president
of Cornell University.

1 . He feels that unless the
three arms of the university
-‘cooperate together one seg-
ment will inevitably be alien-
" 'ated—that segment will be
the student body.

. WHAT PERKINS antici-
pates already exists at this
University and its manifes-
tations are obvious. For in
-reality there is no student
body on this campus. For a
body to exist it must feel it
:is accomplishing something;
Unfortunately, the pervad-
__ing atmosphere among these
here is one of uselessness.
 ‘The common feeling is
"that no matter how a stu-
'- dent group feels on vital is-
sues it doesn’t make any dif-
ference. Too many justifiably
say that decisions will be
"made regardless of student
opinion.

- In essence, students have
-lost faith in themselves as a
pertinent interest group. The
responsibility for this loss
of “faith rests -with the pre-
ént and past-“campus lead-
-ers.     '

 St a tO  nd
_ A major change" in University life has occurred in the last few
, days—the trimester system has been substantially altered. But this is one
time students can not rightly claim their opinions weren't taken into ac-

count. The whole method of handling the trimester problem should serve
, as an example to students who want their thoughts considered on crucial

 

Recently Former Student Government (SG) senator and. SG presi-
dential candidate John Ruskay complained, “We feel student ideas expres-
sion and opinions have not been presented to the rest of the University.”
He speciﬁcally citedﬂthe ﬁrst step of the phasing out of the trimester” as ,
1 an instance when student thought wasn’t adequately represented. While
We agree their have been times when major changes were acted upon in
ignorance of student opinion,_the trimester change was not such a case.

A clear dialogue ‘between students on calendar possibilities was
established through the Student Government sponsored poll conducted
last March. Over 2,000 University undergraduates answered the SG ques-
tionnaire which dealt with state relatedness, tuition rates and other prob-
lems as well as the trimester’ system. ‘

The trimester system received huge support from the students. 36
V percent indicated a deﬁnite preference for the three term calendar over
either the quarter or normal semester systems. The results of the poll .

The Lost Leaders

by Tom Sacks

decisions sdirectly affecting
student life were made by
the administration without
any student _ involvement.
They were: the construction
of new dorms on the hill; the
splitting of the spring tri-
mester; the alteration in
services by the bookstore and
cafeterias.

These decisions are ex-
amples of the failure of stu-
dent leadership. Leaders
should provide administra-
tors with the perception that
the student body is vitally
concerned over such deci-
sions. At the same time lead-
ers must provide students
with the feeling that their
opinions will be absorbed
and respected. ‘

This is the crisis and this is
the key issue in the current
Student Government elec-
tions. Student Government
(SG) is the major represen-
tative of all the students on
this campus. A dynamic lead-
er must be elected who can

convey to the administration-

the students’ united desires.
THAT NEED is more
pressing now than ever be-
fore because the University
is currently undergoing a
major transformation. Such a
transformation necessitates
change and it is necessary
that student opinion be
sought prior to any commit-
ments. If student leaders
fail to articulate student con-
cerns, this institution will
never be a true University.
Two slates are running in
the SG campaign. One is cam-
paigning on the basis of what
it has accomplished in the
past. The other slate is ori-
ented toward what must be
established for the future.

Each platform has some
dynamic ideas. The differ-
ence is the tune of the plat-
forms. One has been praised
as a realistic appraisal of
what can be accomplished in
the present campus atmos-
phere. But the present at-
mosphere does not nurture
an effective student expres-
sion. A possibility of hope
must be maintained. Such a-
future‘ rests with the three
arms, of the University Work-
_ing together. _And it is only

indicated that the trimester wasthe main reason why 27 per
cent of the polls entered the University in the ﬁrst place.

The SC senators presented the results to both the faculty commit-
tee studying -the trimester and to Acting Chancellor Dr. David Kurtzman.
Ultimately the administration was faced with a dilemna. The students
liked the trimester, but why did they like it? They prefered this calendar
because of the lengthy (April-September) summer vacation it afforded
them. Obviously a minority prefered trimester because it permitted them
to graduate in three years. Less than half as many students were register-
ed in the Spring term as were registered in the fall or winter terms.

The administration now in the process of trying to partially pre-
serve the trimester and yet draw more students to the University in the .
summer months. One of the central rationales behind the new 7 1/2 week A

courses is that students might prefer to be on campus only from April to
June and ‘then take their vacation or rest from April to June and return_

to the University in June to study. The changes do represent a reﬂection

of student opinion, tempered by the realities of ﬁnancial limitations.
Let it never be thought that student expression on this subject was
not sought. The partial salvaging of the trimester is in some measure due

to the effective voicing of student thought through the Student Govern-

Student Comments

On Law Lecture
Editor, The Pitt News:

In a recent law school lecture,
Leonard Meeker, a legal advisor
to the State Department, adaptly
brought attention to our political
and legal commitment in Viet-
nam. Both the United Nations

charter and the SEATO agree-'

ment explicitly involve the Unit-
ed States in South East Asian af-
fairs where external aggression is
involved. So on a legal basis, we
are not overstepping our bounds
-—ar_1y dissension must be derived
from moral philosophies and the
individual’s interpretation and
misinterpretation of war and its
implication for this nation.
Someone once remarked to me
that no one should want war and
that, therefore, we should aban-
don our Vietnam policy. Senator
Morse’s recent lecture condoned
the same conclusion on a some-

what parallel basis-—the political I

expediency of participation in
this foreign war provides an im-
moral and dishonest means of
curbing the spread of Communist
inﬂuence in what our government

considers a vital area. In other _

words, if we do not want war,
then why is our foreign policy
such a “graveyard of American
ideals?”

It is obvious that learned men,
older and more experienced than
myself are committed to diverse
attitudes concerning this appar-
ent ﬁasco that has cost 6,000
American lives and billions in in-
vestment while children knock

Lafayette Defeated, But

scoring 20 points and hauling down 15 rebounds, in pacing the Pan-
thers to 58-47 victory over Lafayette.

Gymnastics Squad Opposes
Syracuse Tomorrow;
Outlook Dim for Gymnasts

It takes six men to have a good poker game and the underman-
ned gymnastics squad will have plenty of playing time on their bus
ride to Syracuse for tomorrow's meet. _

. Coach Warren Neiger’s gymnastic squad will stand a fair chance
' of upsetting the Orange if Dave Shidemantle can participate in about
ﬁve events and the co-captains Ig Perez and James Sacco can start

winning some events.

Up until now, coach Neiger has
been dissappointed in the teams
performance with the exception
of Shidemantle. Following an ear-
ly injury, Shidemantle has come
back to last season's champion-
ship form by taking two ﬁrst and
a second in his ﬁrst meet against
Massachusetts.

The main obstacles the gym-
nasts will have to overcome are
Ted Edwards and Ray Walters
in the still ring event, Steve Kev-
les in the all-around division, and
Brian McKinney on the ﬂoor ex-
ercises. Syracuse’s average score,
157, is about 12 points higher
than the gymnasts best score,
145. .

Coach Neiger realizes that if
past performonces are any indi-
cation of their ability, his gym-
nastics squad stands very little
change in tomorrow's meet. In
fact, if Shidemantle has an off

_- day, Neiger remarked, “They
could murder us.”

ASSISTANTS ANNOUNCED

Sports Editor Tom Sacks has
announced that Jay Rosenstein
and George Lies have been
named assistant sports editors
for the winter term. Rosenstein
and Lies have a combined total
of 14 terms gr the sports staff.

Swimmers
Face Orange

The swimming team will get to
see what all their hard work
has been for Saturday when they
travel to Syracuse University
“The meet looks like it will be
very close,” said coach Jerry
Snyder, “but we are hoping to
come out on top.”

Since returning after the Christ-
mas vacation, the team has met
at Trees Hall at 7 a.m. for prac-
tice. When its over, they go to
class, eat, and then, go back up
to the pool for another practice
at 4:15 p.m.

Syracuse will be tough in the
freestyle events. They have a
good backstroker and a ﬁne in-
dividual medley team, and their
divers are more than adequate.
Nevertheless, Snyder feels that
“if the boys can get themselves
up psychologically,” they should
win. “Physiologically, they have
it,” says Snyder, “now its up to
psychology.”

‘Old’ Beano
Says Hello

By GEORGE LIES
Assistant Sports Editor

Ex-sports publicist Beano
Cook, the controversial one,
was on -hand Wednesday
night to see the Panthers win for
a change. And although the game
was none too interesting, Beano
was.

It’s been nine months since he
left the University to accept the
publicity position for ABC tele-
vision sports. And it was the
ﬁrst time he has seen the Pan-
thers in action this year.

“Coming back here is like go-
ing to an old girl friend,” he
said. “Sure I miss it, but I’m glad
I’m gone. I have it easier now
than when I was at Pitt, but
there is ten times as much pres-
sure.”

Beano’s stay in Pittsburgh last-
ed 28 years and at one time, he
had his own sports show on local
radio stations. And he spoke out.

Unlike most sports information
directors, who work behind the
spotlights, Beano Cook was dif-
ferent. “I got the notoriety be-
cause I was honest,” he said.
“The only time I made excuses
was when there were injuries.”

“And if you wanted to criticize
me,” he said, “I guess I did get
too much publicity. But that’s be-
cause I was off-beat. And by this
I mean I told the honest stuff.”

Beano said he had “pretty
much the same freedom in his
present job, but when you make
a mistake, you hear about it.”

As he spoke, he looked around
the Fitzgerald Field House to the
various posters which hang in
the student section such as “Hole
It or Hold It” and “Go Pitt Go,”
and he knows another publicity
man had been at work. His name
is “Horse” Czarnicki. “Horse has
a great imagination,” he said.

Then he turned to nearby
friendsland shouted, “Hey! Let’s
all go down to Gustines,” ‘and
Beano Cook was off again.

Zone Poses

Problems

by JAY ROSENSTEIN, Assistant Sports Editor
Lafayette’s zone defense hampered the Panther basket-
ball team in Wednesday night’s ball game and afterwards
coach Bob Timmons wondered aloud about a similar prob-

lem occurring in tomorrow’s
clash with Penn State at Univer-
sity Park.

The Nittany Lions plays a strict
zone, usually a 2-1-2. “We should
be getting the better shots off
that type of defense,” Timmons
pointed out, “but we don’t work
hard enough. V .

“Lafayette stayed in a zone for

AL DiFRISCI'IIA
Feeds His Teammate

the_whole ball game,” he con-
tinued. “We’d be able to get out
in front of them, but we didn’t
have the instinct, the killer in-
stinct, to break the game open.”

As it turned out, the cagers
won, 58-47, a score which reﬂect-
ed more of Lafayette’s offensive
futility than Panther brillance.

“I sensed a letdown,” said
Timmons, “and there wasn’t
much I could do about it.”

If the cagers suffered a let-
down, Lafayette must have been
infected with sleeping sickness.
The Leopards didn’t score a point
until nearly six minutes had
elapsed in the game.

Before Lafayette coach George
Davidson could wake his team up

by calling two successive time

outs, the cagers, sparked by Al .

DiFrischia had moved to a 23-9
advantage. Then Davidson had
his players modify their zone and
his strategy worked. Lafayette
trailed by only 27-23 at the half.

Timmons countered in the sec-
ond half with a switch from a
zone to a man-for-man in his own
defense. That adjustment, cou-

. pled with Lafayette’s 32 per cent

shooting accuracy from the field,
effectively opened the Panther
margin.

Di_Frischia played his best game
of the season, scoring 20 points
and grabbing 15 rebounds. Syl-
vestor Stevenson, the cagers’, other
sophomore forward, drew praise
from Timmons for work against
the Lafayette zone.

“Steve whipped his passes in- .

stead of lobbing the ball around,”
Timmons noted. “Everyone’s go-
ing to have to do that if we're
going to beat State.”

F rash Cagers Dump Youngstown
77-51; At Johnstown Tomorrow

by MIKE BROURMAN

After a surprisingly easy victory
over Youngstown on Wednesday,
the freshman cagers travel to
J ohnstown tomorrow, looking for
their second victory of the sea-
son over J ohnstown College, and
their sixth straight on the sea-
son.

In their ﬁrst meeting with
J ohnstown, the frosh broke open
a close game in the last ten min-
utes, and won going away, 60-39.
However, coach Tim Grgurich
was not pleased with that show-
ing, pointing to a high number of
turnovers and a low shooting
average.

Grgurich was more pleased with
the showing against Youngstown.
The Cubs broke quickly, racing
to a 24-3 lead before Youngstown
could get untracked, and limited
Youngstown to only four’ ﬁeld
goals in the ﬁrst half while build-
ing up a 36-17 advantage.

In the second half, with Grgu-
rich substituting liberally, the
Cubs maintained their edge, win-
ning easily, 77-51. Bob Petrini
lead the frosh with 32 points,
hitting 16 of 22 from the ﬁeld,
and center Charlie Hunt contin-
ued to raise his scoring each
game_by hitting for 17 points.
Forward Bob McFarland added
11. ' - _

“We really came out of our
doldrums,” said Grgurich, “The
boys wanted it, they got them-
selves up for it, and they got it.
They did a great job out there.”

Although the frosh hit on 43
per cent of their shots, Grgurich
felt there was still room for im-
provement there. “The boys made
some great moves and then miss-
ed some easy shots.7They’re go-
ing to have to make those lay-
ups.”

Grgurichvhas been pleased with
the play of his bench, and feels
it may be a real asset in the
tougher part of the schedule.
“We'll use Paul Naponick a. lit-
tle more each game. He’s starting
to really come along.

“Rick Waggoner played a real-
ly nice game. He has played well
for us all year. So has Bob Brick-
ner. They might have to play a
lot of ball for us later o-n, so they
better be ready.”

Seeking hnpmvement
Matmen lHost Middies

by RAY JACOBS
Normally a coach can expect an improved performance
from his team the next time around after a poor showing.

And it’s also ‘probable that the varsity wrestlers want to
show Dave Johnson what they really can do tomorrow after last
S.:turday’s drubbing by Temple.

Unfortunately, they most likely won't get the chance because
they wrestle Navy at the Field House.

“Navy is the best team in the East,’.' said coach Johnson. “I think
they’re better than Lehigh and certainly a lot tougher than Templie.”

Last year the Middies rocked the wrestlers, 35-3, and the only
winner for the losers, Dino Boni, is gone. Johnson was dubious about
his team’s possible improvement.

“Score-wise, it’ll be worse that Temple. Individually, I hope we
make a better showing. We
weren’t as aggressive against
Temple as we were against St.
Francis. We kind of held back.
in the SU Supper Room at 3 p.m.

Although Eastern champ Wayne
Hicks has graduated, Navy coach
Ed Peery is still deep in individ-
ual talent. Like Temple, much of
his strength lies in~ the lower
weight classes.
