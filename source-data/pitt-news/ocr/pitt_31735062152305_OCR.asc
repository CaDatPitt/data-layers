Smash Kills
Waddell, ’33

Auto Accident Also Hurts
Tlhomas Ewing, Mines

 

 

George Waddell,_a member of the
homore class in the School of
MlI1€S_. was killed last Saturday
“!°1'nmE {is the result of an automo-
bile 3°°1de!1to near Waynesburg.
Waddell, with Thomas Ewing, a
Junior in the School of Mines, were
enpoute to Morgantown with two
friends, a Mr. Kendall and a Mr,
Franklin who are not associated
with the University. They had mace
an early start and it was not yet
daylight; because of the low visa-
bihty, the car in which they were
traveling struck a truck which was
standing on the right hand side of
the road while its driver was inspect-
ing the motor.

Waddell was seated at the driv-
er's right and was so badly injured
that he died immediately after his
arrival at the Greene County Memo-
rial Hospital at Waynesburg. The
funeral was held at his home at
Philippi, West Virginia, Monday
afternoon.

Ewing, seated behind Waddell in
the rumble seat, was seriously cut
about the head and face. He is now
under the physician’s care at the
Greene County Memorial Hospital
and 15 eXP_eCted_ to recover.

The University has extended its
condolences oﬁicially to Mr. and Mrs.
Waddell_ and is keeping in daily
touch with Mrs. Ewing who is stay-
ing at Waynesburg during her son’s
recovery.

Cathedral Of Learning Made
Racing Pylon By Plane;
Plays Tag With Worlzmen

Stone-setters on the ump-
teenth floor of the Cathedral _of
Learning were momentarily dis-
tracted from their work on
Monday afternoon by an air-
plane which buzzed alarmingly
close to the mass of steel and
limestone.

For a period of about two long
minutes the black and orange
cabin monoplane played a per-
sistent game of “watch me
round the pylon,” after the fash-
ion of a Schneider Cup entry,
within what seemed to this ob-
server on the ground to be less
than a hundred feet.

After the playful pilot had
completed his check-up on lunch
boxes and time-keepers on
aforesaid umpteenth ﬂoor, he
took a parting dive and roared
away over Schenley Park, leav-
ing disappointed stone workers
to puzzle over their pinnacles
and Gothic windows.

Pm Weekly,
Motor Club T a  
Hit Speeders

Co-operating with the National
Safety Congress which met in Pitts-
burgh last week, a the Pitt Weekly
and the Pittsburgh Motor Club an-
nounces the launching of a cam-
paign against reckless, speeding au-
toists on University Drive.

In the past few months careless
driving on this roadway has caused
a series of minor accidents and has
endangered the lives of hundreds of
students. With no police super-
vision being exercised on the cam-
pus drives, autoists have converted
them into speed courses, particular-
ly on that stretch between State
Hall and the Upper Dental building.

Action from the city traffic de-
partment is expected shortly as the
result of a letter addressed to In-
spector Jacob Dorsey, bureau of
traffic police, by C. H. Roth,” secre-
tary of the Motor Club. In the let-
her, Mr. Roth points out the. dan-
gerous situation and requests that

stop speeding on the campus in or-
der to protect the lives of students.

Although running through the
University grounds, the road is not

Campus Heads
Hear Faculty

At Banquet

N e e cl For Activities
Stressed At C:roup’s‘
Annual Meet

Almost two hundred -students,
connected with various campus ac-
tivities came together in Heinz
House, Tuesday evening, and heard
an abundance of sage advice, sug-
gestions and criticism poured forth

by administrative heads and repre-
sentatives of the students.

The occasion was the annual oili-
cers’— night dinner, tendered by
Thyrsa W. Amos, dean of women,
and Robert C. Clothier, dean of
men, to heads and participants in
extra-curricular activities of the
University. The place of activities
and how they should be conducted
on the campus was the thesis for
talks given by Chancellor John G.
Bowman, Dean Amos, Dean Clo-
thier, Prof. Robert D. Ayars, Mar-
garet Hall, Col. ’31, president of
Women’s Self Government Associa-
tion, and Robert Kleeb, Col. ’31,
president of Omicron Delta Kappa,
national honorary activities frater-
nity.

Prolonged applause followed the
talk of C ancellor John G. Bowman,
who with unusual sincerity and en-
thusiasm, climaxed his remarks by
stressing the importance of college
activities in teaching responsibility
and advised each student to select
some activity in which he felt that
he could be both happy and have
the opportunity to express himself.

Bowman Moved

Visably affected by the rapt at-
tention with which the lar e audi-
ence of students listened to is talk,
expressing his ideals of modern
education, the Chancellor at the end
of his address was moved to say
‘fYou have been a real inspiration
to me this evening:: you are the
kind of students that one feels hon-
ored in striving for.”

As toastmaster of the evening,
Dean Clothier said that the meeting
was probably the only one of its
kind in any university in America,
and stressed the fact that all pres-
ent possessed a common interest and
responsibility in assuming leader-
ship in their respective activities.
He emphasized the importance of
responsibility, saying that character
was built on performance rather
than on prestige, and pleaded for an
attitude of responsibility with honor
and credit in University activities.

Activities Needed

Dean Amos, in her short talk,
stated her belief in the value of
extra-curricular work, saying that
students needed activities for their
leisure time, the same as a business
man took up golf, but cautioned lest
the activity be unworthy of the
time and effort required.

Prof. Robert Ayars said that in
addition to knowledge one needed to

Faculty Advisors To
Meet With F reshies

Freshmen met with their faculty
advisers Tuesday noon when discus-
sion of problems conzfnonting the
ﬁrst year students was taken up by
the various giroups.

After -this ﬁrst meeting, freshmen
and their advisers will meet at sev-
eral appointed times during the first
semester when discussions on Uni-
versity matters will be taken up.

More than one hundred faculty
members are serving as advisers to
the first year students and acting as
sort of personnel officers, helping
the freshmen to adjust themselves
to the life of the University.

The student is expected to keep
appointments with his adviser with
the same faithfulness that he at-
tends classes and may be excused
only by consulting with his -adviser.

 

 

Do Pitt Students .
Want Self-Government?

The power of regulating student affairs and enforcing dis-
cipline over students at Pitt must always, in the last analysis,

rest in the hands of the faculty

The power which admits students to and graduates students
from an institution is logically—-and legally—the only one

which has the right to regulate
as undergraduates.

Such an unavoidable situation at once causes the skeptic
to ask, “Why have student self-government associations at all?
Why can not the faculty govern student life? How can govern-
ment associations be made effective in a co-educational insti-

tution? Do Pitt students want

An earnest attempt to solve ;these problems will be made
next Wednesday when Student Council sponsors the ﬁrst of a

proposed series of student and

ise to be really more than the usu
little results but an excess amou

making thorough preparations:

by a leader ‘who has- made some study of the question _: and
both faculty members and students alike are being solicited to

attend.

“Do Pitt Students Want Self-Government” is a particu-
larly fortunate topic for the ﬁrst-‘pf ‘these meetings. Coming
at a time when Council has under consideration plans for an
even greater student control of campus organizations by means
of a Men’s Self-Governing Association, the question takes on

added signiﬁcance.

Self-government a_s exprossed"in Student Council arose at
Pitt from an appreciation of the value which this form of civic

education possesses, combining

change from the traditional manner in which the University
was handling problems of student life. It was enthusiastically
endorsed for several reasons; in the ﬁrst place, a self-govern-

mcnt association is the creator

lic opinion. The consensus of opinion ﬁnds expression in a few
rules which govern extra-curricular and social hfe of the stu-
dents, and Pitt administrative officers have repeatedly said
that student opinion is sound and wholesome when one gets
to the core of it. Self-government associations also aid in de-

veloping the independent social

of intercourse’ among the students. Another important rea-
son for their existence is the fact that much of the legislation
affecting the student body may be enforced through the asso-
ciation, if that group is composed of sufficiently capable mem-

bers.

On the other hand there are p _
opinion that members of student governing groups, such as the
Pitt council, are unfortunate victims of circumstance in_ being
part of a body which has no really valuable or essential use
on a University campus. This charge was hurled against Stu-
dent Council last year. .Such criti s hold that the whole sys-
tem of student government shoul'_,, be abolished until a real

need for it is apparent.

Each position has its argumentld. Which isriglit is not for
Probably after next Wednesday’s dis-
cussion, a clearer light will  thrown on ‘the whole problem.
Council has selected a most important subject for the _ ﬁrst
meeting, one which deserves a_ large and attentive audience.

porch of the old red brick residence
are threatened by the steamshovel

Professor W. M. Parrish, head of
the public speaking department, has
announced that tryouts for the squad
of the Men’s Debating Association
will be held over a period of two
days, Thursday, October 16, from
12:30 to 4 p. m., and Friday, Octo-

questions: Resolved: That the Eight-
eenth Amendment should be re-
pealed and the control of the liquor
traffic left to the several states, and

Iron Calf

 

Today’s Educated Criminals
Flayed By Noted Lawyer

By VIRGINIA LEWIS, Col. '31
. “In Pittsburgh you worship the
lT0’l1 calf,” Clarence Darrow, crim-
inal lawyer, stated over the coffee
cups, in his hotel Tuesday morning.
“For that reason perhaps it is bet-
ter not to discuss these topics in
this city.” Mr. Darrow was talking
about civil liberties in general and
civil liberties in particular,

“Crime? conscience? what do you
mean? what do you know about con-
science? By criminals do you mean
the men who sell you liquor, or the
stockbrokers who buy stock for
$1,000 and sell it to you for $100,000,
or is crime the things for which men
are put in jail? Education will not
lessen the number of crimes, for it
is the educated who are committing
them. Nor will reading the Bible
help, as some might suppose. Mr.
Darrow declared, “The Bible is used
more in the jails than anywhere.
There is more Christianity in the
cells than in all the outside world.”

“I ﬁnd no need for religion,” Dar-
row declared, his blue eyes twin-
kling, “no need for a god, nor does
one feel the need of me. Is religion
necessary for happiness? If happi-
ness is what we live for-—laughing
gas or chloroform is more certain.”

Atheist ,

Mr. Darrow doesn’t mind if people
call him an atheist. “Why should I
care what they call me? People are
cruel and ignorant and lacking in
imagination. What does it matter to
me what they say, think or do.” In
fact he -thinks sometimes the atheist
is correct in his views.- “There are
many things I want to believe and
can’t because there is no tangible
evidence of them, and there are
many things which I must believe
which I do not want to.” People
are unkind, Mr. Darrow thinks, and
until they become possessed of more
imagination things will be no better.

Council Plans
Open Forum
For Students

Will Discuss Soph Hop;
Council Member May
Offer Resignation

“Do Pitt Students Desire Student
Government?” will be the topic of
the discussion which will follow
Student Council meeting next Wed-
nesday evening. The forum will be
open to all students and faculty
members that are interested.

This is the ﬁrst movement of the
new Council toward the establish-
ment of better relationships between
themselves and the student body,
and toward their ideal, student sup-
port by legislating in accordance
with their desires. The discussion
will follow the regular business
meeting.
According to the motion, spon-
sored by Naomi Ericson, Col. ’31,
that “at the next regular meetin of
Student Council, immediately fol ow-
ing the business, an open forum
shall be held to discuss ‘Do Pitt Stu-
dents Desire Student Government’?”
this meeting will be held. This sub-
ject was suggested by Dean Thyrsa
Amos who believed that such a sub-
ject would be of interest to the en-
tire student body and , should be a
drawing card.

Name Group
The committee as appointed by
President Edwards,‘ Dent. '31, con-
sists, of Naomi Erickson, Col. '31,
chairman; Adelaide Hunter, Col. ’32,
and Charles Seidle, Col. ’31. These
members are responsible for the suc-
cess of the discussion.

To Resign

At the regular business meeting,
preceding the forum, it is expected
that Louise Lynn, Ed. ’32, will re-
sign from.her duties on the Student
Council, due to outside activity. In
case she makes such a move, it will
be necessary for Council to elect an-
other woman from the Junior class
to ﬁll her vacancy.

Whether Emanuel Fishkin, Col.
’31, will present his plans for" Men’s
Self Government or not is a matter
of conjecture. Because -of his ab-
sence atmeeting last ,w,.eel;.. I}(>...a.c-..
tion was taken on the matter.

It will be necessary to consider the
appointments to the Soph Hop com-
mittee, made by Jack McParland,
Col. ’33, chairman. These appoint-
ments passed Students’ Relations

‘ committee during the past week, but

it will be necessary to have formal
action on the committee by Council.

Club Plans Annual
Cook Forest Trip

The Collembola Club will make
its annual trip to Cook Forest in
north central Pennsylvania October
18, instead of on October 25, as it
was ﬁrst planned. The change was
made on account of the Pitt-Notre
Dame game.

The ‘club members will leave Sat-
urday afternoon by bus and will re-
turn to Pittsburgh Sunday evening.
The trip is under the direction of Dr.
0. E. Jennings, head of the botany
de artment.

he group is planning to publish
a club annual this year containing
scientiﬁc papers submitted by the
members. This new Pitt publica-
tion will make its appearance on
the campus about the ﬁrst of May.

The officers have decided to limit
the number of freshman members
to twenty-ﬁve. Membership from
the upperclasses is not limited. All
freshmen who think they would be
interested in the club's work are
asked to drop a slip of paper con-
taining their names and addresses
in the Collembola box on the second
floor of Zoology Main.

Five “Students Askeﬁ
To Reduce Number“ 
Of Activities V’

Entering upon a stricter 
ment campaign with respect to
revised Point Scale system, ﬁve
den-ts have been compelled to ‘
certain of their activities at the,
quest of the Dean of Men. Sev _
others are expected to receivo~ 
request within the next few- Y "
With the possible exception of . I
or two cases, no ‘women are oam_ry-I
ing excess activity points,
to Miss Helen Rush, assistant to
dean of women.

Hits Leaders ,
Included among those studen'
who have been compelled to r
their activities points to the m.
mum of ten are some of, the’ ,
prominent leaders of campus anti
ties. Theodore Biddle, assistant? I
the Dean of Men, pointed out;-t
no discredit should be reﬂected;
the men inasmuch as several-
proven themselves capable of c _
ing the excess points and main
mg satisfactory scholastic average.
The point scale committee, 'how’evei'.,;
is determined to enforce the ;Po-’ S’
Scale system rigidly during
present year, he add “

ed.

Several men will probably be , V
mitted to carry excess points
cording to Biddle, if afteria revisit,
of the situation, the Point Scalic
committee recommends such excep-
tions. The scholastic standing. 
the men and the importance of ..
activities will be the points on w y 
the committee will make its ' "

sion.
Careful Check

The systematic method whereby
careful check is made on pain
carried by women before they‘,
accept office, was given by
Rush as the reason for ‘the,’
women who are carrying '
points this fall. Before a
can accept any position in..an»..
tivity she mus-t ﬁle a list of .,
previous extra-curricular work 
her scholastic average for the 3‘
proval of the office of the 
women. This prevents the loading‘?
on of excess points and later 

nations.

In addition to the stricter

$1,500 Loss In Basement  E‘

‘M

The quick curbing of a roaring
ﬁre discovered last Monday night‘ in
a corner’ of the basement of Stain,
Hall near the treasurer’s omce, is tot.
be attributed to cool action and ra
work on the part of University '
employes. Steve Clugstor, .S
Hall watchman, discovered the bias
that sent ﬂames licking over w H
and ceiling that had destroyed phi
of the ﬂight of stairs leading up*in"}s
the ﬁrst ﬂoor as he entered the builiﬁu
ing at 10:30. He called other 
to the building, and by means". ‘i
ﬁre extinguishers kept the infetﬁti
in check until an engine from
Neville street ﬁre station arrived. ..

An estimated damage of $1,6_%
was the result of the ﬁre, whiehﬁ » ’
is believed, originated in a large‘.
board beneath the stairs '-M.
oﬂice supplies had been stored,"
spread to the lockers in the '’
hall. The night help in the -
ing were successful in fighting,
ﬂames with ‘ﬁre extinguishers ,
the ﬁre department arrived to 
ﬁnal check on the blaze. . 

Many old invoices, papers, an ,,"
number of adding machines, ",
which had been in storaﬁgiewere do‘-
stroyed by the ﬂames. 
two sides of the hall, the woodw
and the lockers were badly dam __
As the result of the intense heat, ﬁll
stone steps leading from the bases-
ment to -the ﬁrst ﬂoor cracked when
the streams of cold water_,w
played upon them. Mr. McLean‘:o£
the building department, pla.ced,.mg
on the job immediately and tem
rary wooden steps were erected: V

will transform the University Club
dining room into an ideal college
dance retreat tonight. With a num-
ber of Pitt boys playing in the
Green Imps, a genuine Pittsburgh
atmosphere will prevail.

Plans for the dance have been
arranged by a committee consisting
of C. Fred Lucas, ’31, chairman;

Morris Cohen and Ted Savage

In passing we saw a very clever
pair of earrings so we went back
and looked all over again and the
earrings were 0. K., long spirally,
gold ones that might have been a
couple of miniature circular stair-
cases. And we saw them again and
again, and a very pretty face be-
tween them. The face and earrings
belonged to Elaine Blauvelt, Fresh-
man, who came to the University

and other points of the compass. It
is little wonder that Elaine had a
noticeably graceful carriage, being
her father's daughter, and her fa-
ther an army captain.

at Panther Hollow? None other
than Johnny Roth, and John hunt-

An interlude, not so strange, be-

tell you that Bernard Windt, in ad-

Helen Hess, a soph., wears a
coilfure that is sine excellence in
naivete. Her hair is blonde, and
done in a little roll at the back of
her head. And then behind each car
are two little curls, very natural
looking. It reminded us of the days
of the Bo-peep dresses, and the
minuet, and the ladies all dropping
little perfumed hankies. and the
Y0|IIIg_ gallantipicking them all up.
Did you see the picture of Gladys
Schmidt in the newspapers at the be-

That reminds me of Jaimy Laf-
ferty who used to -say, “live and
learn.” Jim, by the way, is learn-
ing to drop his r’s at Harvard Law
School. Did you know ‘Carl Voss
had a nickname besides Carlos. It is
Hive. I don’t know but maybe it is
because Carlos is a sweet boy. Such
nice blonde hair. Not curly though.
Sleepy Frank Yellig has the blonde
curls in his hair. There are so many
kniknames. I don’t know why. But

Red Head John—-the little lady of
Cap and Gown. And James McAf—

the same show is called Itch. Now
what is the reason! The vagaries of
the human mind as far as pet names
are concerned are beyond These and
Those.

Next to the mailman, visitors are
always welcome around the Weekly
Office. Now it is Allan Wilkoﬁ who
is making himself useful around her
until he gets a regular job. Allan,
you remember, was in Cap and Gown
too. And he means very well. Good
dancer, so I hear.

Wilma Mackey who takes care of
the College Office is a girl after my
own heart. A great big smile for
everybody. And some giddy chat-
ter that I love like everything. Even
if she knows some of the College-
ians’ innermost scholastic sorrows
she doesn't let on.

heard of such things but I never

Ray is going to be a preacher be-
cause he preached in Pittsburgh
churches all summer. And Wilma

It does me good to see people inter-

§poeding 0n ,
illampus Must Be Stopped . _. . .

The whole of Pittsburgh has been made to think in terms
 safety for the past two weeks with the National Safety Coun-
I if holding its nineteenth annual congress in our midst. Lec-
urers have stressed caution and vigilance in the performance
of even the simple tasks; safety exhibits have given us a no-
 of the work and expense incurred in promoting accident
prevention in modern industry; at every street corner we are
. greeted with banners and ‘slogans telling ‘us rather pointedly to
Stay Alive.” Along with the rest of Pittsburgh, the student
y of the University has apparently caught the spirit of the
, gress. '
Yet one of the most dangerous conditions in the entire dis-
?trict exists right here on the Pitt campus with apparently little
‘bﬁort being made to correct it!
Reckless, inconsiderate, speeding drivers have made Uni-
trersity Drive from State Hall to the Upper Dental Building a
,_ eadly thoroughfare. The temptation to speed, for those de-
‘scending the hill, is great. It is a straight-away course. The
._rade is not so steep that a car cannot be halted at its base.
does ‘value human life so lightly asto tear down the roadway
t a ﬁfty mile clip. _
V But across that drive approximately 10,000 students pass
daily in walking to and from classes. At the upper end of the
‘road there is no walk, and pedestrians must trudge along the
curbing. An unbroken string of parked cars lines one side of
_e roadway. Yet a few rattle-brain collegians, some heedless
xi drivers and a whole ﬂock of thoughtless rivate motorists
Eersist in attempting to establish a new spe recorddown the
rive.
The city’traﬂ‘ic department does nothing about it. Little
attention is paid to the situation by either the University or
-the ‘student government associations.
to the old adage that “It is human to err,” and that we must
accept accidents as one of the by-products of human endeavor?
Haven’t they yet grasped the signiﬁcance in changing that
adage to “It is_criminal to err”? ‘ ‘
~ ~ There have been no serious accidents on University Drive.
_ (But because there have been none is no guarantee that there
will be none in the future. Unless the Speeder is curbed there
will be at some time—maybe even today—-a fatal accident on
the drive between State Hall and the Dental Building.

, With the Pitt football team playing most of its games

abroad this year, much dissatisfaction has been heard among
the students regarding the price they are forced to pay in order
to see the Panthers play away from home. The students paid
$3.00 to see the Pitt-West Virginia game and they will have
tohand over the same amount if they wish to see the remaining
, Pitt games abroad.
2, ‘ ’ Students from the schools which Pitt plays at the stadium
‘are no better off, however, as they, too, must pay $3.00 to see
their favorites play. The Penn State students have been doing
‘ this for more than a decade.

. Most students are of the opinion that $3.00 is too high a
price’ to ask of college students and consequently only _a few
of them travel to see their team _play. $1.50 is the price which
most students are willing to pay.

f At present, no schools in this section have reduced rates
or
editor of the Pitt Stadium, Press, has told the writer of a plan
under discussion last year in the Southern states whereby'vis-
ing students would pay $1.50 to see their team play another

1*‘ school which was in on the agreement. 
. A‘ The plan never proceeded further than the discussion stage
‘;“but Mr. Turbyville is ofthe opinion that a modiﬁcation of the
plan might work with success here.
_Due to the increase in the number of collegiate» football
tadiums, more and more games will be played abroad each
.. year. Most of the games will be scheduled with schools on a
3 “home-and-home basis. Aplan could be easily worked _out where-
*»by the students from both schools could gain admission to the
games by paying $1.50. . . .
. To prevent non-students from taking advantage of the re-
zzfduction in the prices, student books with a picture of the stu-
dent pasted in the book would have to be shown by the appli-
cant before he would be allowed to purchase a ticket.

’ Next year Pitt will play three games abroad with Iowa.
Notre Dame and Penn State. These same schools will be met
if at the Pitt stadium in 1932. Now is the time for Pitt authori-
 ties to start negotiations with the athletic department of these
schools to insure a reduced rate for admission tickets for the
students.

» The writer believes that this subject is of suﬁicient im-
portance for student council to investigate the probabilities of
-‘ obtaining a. reduced rate for the Pitt students at these games.

‘ The student body would appreciate any such action on coun-
cil's part.

do Back
 To The Parade . . . -.

V N_o announcement has been forthcoming from either the
pi. athletic department or student council as to what plans are
being‘ made for a demonstration on the eve of the Pitt-Carnegie
ech game for the city championship.
, Football spirit reaches fever height in the week preced-
V pg this garng and there is certain to be some sort of planned
_ pep celebration, but it is hoped that it will prove considerably
-more successful than that held last year. A. year ago, the an-
nual downtown parade was eliminated and a bonﬁre pep meet-
;‘5Y}8' Substituted. This was not by any stretch of the imagina-
“tion, a success._ ‘Those sponsoring the meeting once again
_ &earned the futility_ of attempting any general night gather-
glllg‘ in an urban university whose students for the most part
1‘ we at home. You can’t get them out——even for a rally against
Carnegie Tech.
As a tradition on the campus the parade had come to re-
jﬁect the true spirit of_ the University and the student body.
.Th0_“S3«ndS 9f D€I‘S0n_s in downtbwn Pittsburgh had an oppor-
tunity to witness this spirit, and it gave to them an attitude
concerning the outcome of the annual game.

There exists much speculation as
to just Who does support the The-
ater Guild. If one attended the bril-
liant production of Mr. Shaw’s lat-
est drollery, he could have found the

answer. In the
APPLE SAUCE Who of the audi-
ALA CARTE ence (which was,
at times, of even
greater dramatic interest than the
play) he would have discovered
what one might choose to call a
“goodly” number of representatives
from our University world. Our
curiosity was aroused as to Why this
valiant minority supported the cur-
rent. Shavian exposure of royalty-
and-other-things. There follow some
of the typically unusual answers to
“Why did you go to see The Apple
Cart?”

“Why,” said one youn lady, “I
see all the Guild plays. wouldn’tI
miss one for anything!" The stu-

dent who displayed this peculiar
lack of discrimination will soon re-
ceive a degree which will label her
Educated,

Then there was the “eager” fe-
male. “Oh . . . Bear-nodd Show—ah
. . . (Barney to you), upon which
she sighed ecstatically and bovinely:
A rather formal “Business Adder”
remarked that Shaw is always good
for an interesting, occasionally
pleasant, economic treatise. Not
bad, that.

A fourth student went, because-
“I heard it was a Riot!” ? ? ! ! ! '

of that three thousand word mono-

Freshmen May Be Down But.
Not Out; Obey Customs,
Traditions Beautifully

The freshman class‘ deserves
to be congratulated upon’ the
excellent co-operation they have
shown in acceptingithe spirit of
freshman customs, according to
Hubert Garver, Dernt. ’31, chair-
man of the customs committee.

As proof of this spirit, Gar-
ver cites the large freshman
cheering section that turned
out for the Waynesburg game
with their frosh caps and ties.
Garver expressed his apprecia-

" tion of the Druids who, to--
gether with the customs com-
mittee, aided in enforcing them
at the game. I . ,

preached at us bflall the sundry
evils of our civilization. In spite of
the vivacious interlude wherein His
Majesty and his mistress played
roly-poly on the palace floor, inspite
of such deliberate shockery, we ﬁnd
Shaw an Idealist at Eighty. Or is
it Ninety? Those of us who saw
the play have nice chuckling and
mumbling recollections. Those who
did not, or (oh, rebels and ‘Philli-
stines) would not see the play, we
should like to hear from your own
barbaric lips, why you did not see it.
(Come, now, out with it!)

 

“Here we have the very kernel of
modernity, its brutal frankness, its
passion for life stripped, its denial,
it unquenchable curiosity, and its
restive energy.”—Galsworthy.

In these words of Gals-
STAY worthy, the Englishessay-
ALIVE ist and novelist, we ﬁnd a.
compact and incisive sum-
marization of the modern spirit. Ap-
parently, We Moderns ﬁnd it neces-
sary to race about dispatching our
trivial duties, or pursuing even
more transient and insigniﬁcant
pleasures. We pay small attention
to where we are going, or how.- Our
chief considerations are——how quick-
ly are we getting here, there, or
anywhere. , ‘

In the rush of our unthinking ‘ef-,
ﬁci_e_ncy, we feel that we must uti ize
(pitiful word) every minute. Little
thought is given to whether we en-
danger either our own lives or those
of others. The National Safety Con-
gress, held last week, is endeavoring
to curb the recklessness of motor,

other present-day hazards.

Cass Opens New Era
In Dramatic Program

 

. A new era in dramatics will be
inaugurated this year in the Univer-
sity public speaking department. A
new instructor, Carl Cass, has been
engaged and is planning an ex-
tensive program. _Mr. Cass is the
first dramatic director to be em-
ployed directly by the University. He
has had experience in directing and
graduate work in dramatics, was for
three years professionally identiﬁed
with the Goodman Theater of Chi-
cago,.a member of the Repertoire
Company and a Senior member of
the Actors’ Equity Association.

The Pitt Players are attemptin
development under a system that wil
enable 125 students to appear in
some production. During the year
there will be given three major Pitt
Player productions. The ﬁrst will be

staged some time in November and
1Wlll be announced shortly. A Yule-

Minnesota Opens New
Experiment “Omnibus College”

As another step toward developing
the needs of the individual student
of exceptional ability, the adminis-
tration of the University of Minne-
sota has instituted an‘expe_i-iment to
be known as the “omnibus college”
this year. ‘ I

Heretofore, students registering
at any college of the university,
were obligated. to fulﬁll the pre-
scribed curriculum of that . college,
not being permitted to select elec-
tives in any other college. Some stu-
dents» found that their objective de-
-manded that they take courses in
several different colleges, and that
their college work was seriously
hampered by ,_ this ruling.

The “omnibus college” has been
established with the purpose of giv-
ing more freedom to the exception-
ally intelligent --student, who knows
what hewants, and=has a deﬁnite ob-*
jective in mind, accord to Dr. John
T. Tate, ‘professor of physics, chair-
man of the committee of 22 campus
izducators who are directing this col-
ege.

Harvard’s House Plan Is
A Student Responsibility

The class of 1934 will be the ﬁrst
to go through Harvard under what
has come to be known as the
“House Plan.” The Harvard Crimson
has recently evaluated the plan on
the basis of its effectiveness in
changing the social organization,
and has insisted that this change
must come from the student body,
rather than being super-imposed by
the House masters.  

“Excessive attachment» for the
English system of education and a
feeling that it is deﬁnitely superior
to that in force at Harvard is lead-
ing some of the masters to believe
that they can graft this fruit onto 3
tree of a purely native growth,"
states the editor. “Therelis ii danger
that the new relations between fac-
ulty and student body may give rise
to a feeling of responsibility on ‘the
part of the former which may lead
to an offensive form of paternalism,
so foreign to the nature of Harvard.”

“The Crimson feels that any
forced change in the social order
from above is worse than unneces-
sary. The success of the House Plan
must come directly and entirely from
the student body itself; and change

Cadets Carouse Properly
To Morgantown’s Relief

Taps resounded on every corner of
Morganitown, West Virginia, last
Saturday after the Mountaineers
were beaten by the Panthers, and
members of the Band and Bugle and
Drum Corps stood with bowed head
in memory of the beaten Mountain-
eers. In front of Morgantown’s big-
gest theater, hotel, restaurant, and
on the busiest corner the bugles were
blown and uniformed band members
stood with uncovered heads.

It will be some days before the
staid inhabitants of Morgantown re-
cover from the 16-0 score, but it may
be weeks before many of them re-
cover from -the effects of a roaming
band, proud of its team.

After playing at the game and
marching back to its quarters a
number of the bandmen and buglers
organized for a. systematic tour of
the little town.

standing alone in a circle of thirty

F rosh Women Meet
Dean Amos At Dinner

Freshman representatives. met
with Dean Thyrsa Amos on Monday
evening, October 6, at the Heinz
House. These representatives, one
from each mentor group, were
elected at last Friday's mentor meet-
ing.

The meeting was opened by Dean

01. Amos who gave a talk on human

relationships. Each woman intro-
duced herself to Dean Amos and
gave the name of her Senior Men-
tor. Then supper was served.

Miss Rush presided over the dis-
cussion which followed. The fresh-
man womerrtalked about the bene-
ﬁts of the monitor group system and
decided unanimously that it is very
advantageous in promoting friend-
ships and good will among the stu-
dents. It was suggested that in the
four remaining meetings of -the men-
tor groups, such topics as, freshman
organization of class officers, how
they should study, the grading sys-
tem in the University, could proﬁt-
ably be discussed.

Miss Rush is planning for this
representative group to hold more
meetings. In the future the singing
of Pitt songs is to be an additional
feature at the meeting.

Frat Manual

Freshmen to Get Handbook
Of Rush Rules Next Week

 

I

Under the editorship of Allen
Wilkoff, Col. '30, work on’ the sec-
ond annual Interfraternity Hand-
book has been concluded. The hand-
book will appear on the ..;ampus Fri-
day, when a copy will be mailed to
each man of the September fresh-
man class, so that he may familiar-
ize himself with its contents before
his meeting with his upperclassman
adviser on Friday, October 17.

The handbook is designed pri-
marily to acquaint freshmen with
campus fraternities and fraternity
regulations. It contains the revised
rushing mles of Interfraternity
Council, a brief history of each fra-
ternity on the campus and of Inter-
fraternity Council, and an estimate
of average fraternity expenses at
the University. Other features in-
clude a message of welcome from
Robert C. Clothier, dean of men,
and reproductions of the pins of the
various University fraternities.

Wilkoﬂ’, the editor of the hand-
book, is a member of Phi Epsilon
Pi, national social fraternity; of Phi
Alpha Theta, national honorary his-
toric fraternity, and of the Under-
graduate Cap and Gown Club. He
was a member of the 1929 Junior
Prom committee; 1929 publicity

ing Pitt, qualiﬁed with a 74, but
ﬁnally lost out to George Dunlap,
of Princeton. —
Pitt Needs Links

In fii_5Cl1SSin8‘ the possibilities of
.0I'8‘amZmg‘ a team, Parks said" that
the greatest obstacle to be overcome
would be the lack of ‘a suitable
course upon which to practice and
hold scheduled matches. The Schen-
ley course would be neither, long
enough nor practical in other re-
spects for Intercollegiate’ playing,
stated Parks, but«he also expressed
l1ttle_doubt that some local private
club would come forward and offer
the use of their course if a golf
team became a reality at the Uni-
versity. ,

“In all the Western Conference
schools, golf is carried as a major
sport,” continued Parks. “Yale,
Harvard, Dartmouth, Princeton and
the majority of the schools in the
East all support strong golf teams.
In a few schools, a dual schedule
of football and golf is carried on a
Sllfgle schedule, the golf matches
being played in the morning of the
day which the football game is
scheduled.

Could Arrange Schedule

“I believe that we would have no
trouble in arranging a suitable golf
schedule with Penn State, Ohio
State, Michigan and others of the
schools played by Pitt. It would
be a great thing for Pitt if we
could have a team entered in the
National_ Intercollegiate Tourna-
ment which is to be held at Chicago
next year.” .

Commenting further, Parks says
that although no popular interest in
golf has been displayed in the past
by Pitt men, he believes that there
are probably some good golfers in
the student body, as yet undiscov-
ered, who would furnish enough ma-
terial» for a team.

It rests with these men to decide
whether or not Pitt could support
a golf team, says Parks, for unless
there is enough available material,
they cannot expect the Athletic" De-
partment to make any deﬁnite ar-
rangements. __

Any men interested are urged to
see either_ Director of Athletics W.
Don Harrison at the Stadium office,
or Sam Parks Jr.

 

Western Reserve Greeks To
Hold Open House

Tomorrow at Cleveland an af-
fair, probably a luncheon, has been

arranged by George I. Carson,
lumni secretary, before the game.

There are ﬁve hundred Pitt alumni
within a radius of fifty miles of
Cleveland who are expected to at-
tend thergame. Karl E. Davis, for-
merly director of athletics at Pitt,
now serving in that capacity ‘at
the Cleveland school, is sending a
circular and an order blank to ev-
eryone of them so they can get tick-
ets. These tickets will be furnished
in _the same section as the block
which was sent to Ollie Stiff at the
stadium. This will take care of all
the Pitt ticket wants.

‘Western Reserve has a band of
sixty and there is sure to be plenty
of color at the game. A special
trainload of students are expected
to attend the game at League Park
in Cleveland.

It was hoped that it could be ar-
ranged for the Pitt band to attend
_ This was impossible, as

clude both games.

Tickets for the train can be had

eral street, city ticket office, Oliver

at the Director of Student Activi-
ties office. The price for the round
trip will be $3.50.

Yessiree, how did you like the
way we went into “them thar hills”
and took the Mountaineers over last
Saturday. My roommate, Eddie
Hirshberg, didn’t have any passes
thrown to him in the West ‘Virginia
game, but we only pulled three pass
plays the_whole game. Anyhow, do
you remember that pass he snatched
in the Waynesburg game with three
men around him?

Hirshberg’s Tutor

Not that I want to boast or any-
thing, but it was me who taught
Eddie. how to do that. I throw
seven or eight pillows in rapid suc-
cession at him every night and he
sure nabs ’em. With his nightly
pre-bedtime, pillow snaring experi-
ence, Eddie can lay his success at

Western Reserve hopes, in a few
years, to be on an equal basis with
Pitt in football. They are a school
of twelve thousand students, with
an immense campus, and a building
development that is one of the larg-
est in the United States. They are
now engaged in a campaign to raise
$750,000 for a dormitory.

Western Reserve next year will
play its games in the new municipal
stadium, which will take care of
100,000 fans. It will be double-
decked, and the seats will be cov-
ered.

Four of the Reserve fraternities
have chapters at Pitt, Delta Tau
Delta, Phi Gamma Delta, Lambda
Chi Alpha and Sigma Chi. The
Cleveland chapters have been in
touch with the locals, and an open
house is the result of the dickerings.
Elaborate arrangements have been
made for the Pitt fraternities.

why “Hoodie” gained consistently,
not Heller. I guess I might as well

tell you the reason for the above
statement.
Hood from B. V.

Well, here it is: “Hoodie” lives
in the Beaver Valley distric-t, and
so do I, and you can’t play foot-
ball there unless you are good. And
me and Franklyn are sure good.
But Heller says he is from Steel-

picion that I saw him there, and he
can’t convince me otherwise.

Jock again put all the substitutes

back when Jess Quatse fell on-me
in practice a week ago, but it is
coming around nice so “Jock” isn’t
too worried about my absence from
the game. ' ,

Twenty - seven Seek F r o s h
Swimming Bertha

 

Fourteen varsity and twenty-
seven freshman candidates for the
Panther swimming teams answered
Coach Pat Corr’s call for swimming
talent last Monday afternoon at the
Trees Gym pool. _

The list of varsity candidates in-
cludes six lettermen from last year’s
tri-state champions and eight ml‘
meral winners from last year’s
great freshman team which lost but

one meet in ten starts and later
atoned for that defeat by defeatm-‘I
their conquerors in a return match.

Lettermen Back

The lettermen returning are ‘Cap-
tain Fred~Wooldridge, Mawhinney‘,
George, Schmieler, Jackson and
Swenson, while the sophomore b_r1-
gade includes Hanna, University
champion in the longer free styl?
events; Reilly, Cogswell, Campi,
Booth, Holtzman, Makagon and
Stephanovitch. «

Freshman mermen include Nor-
ton, Maslyk, Garvey, Myplores.
Gpldenson, Schitman, Snyder, Cunk,
Morton, Aldersbury, Zimmerman.
Bishop, Brinkos, McCure, Llntiugi
Scherr, Breen, Smith, Hutchins,
Larimer, Hembert, Balu_1a,. Pigot.
McKee, Taylor, Bohr, Carik. »

Norton and Carik are the best
known locally of the freshmen. At
the University scholastic champion-
ships in 1929, each of these lads
won two events and aided their re-
spective high schools in ﬁnishing in
a tie "for second place.

Norton In Sprints

Norton will swim in_the free
style sprints for the yearlings while
Carik will swim the 100 yards back
stroke and he will also participate
in the fancy dive. '

At the ﬁrst practice on Monday
afternoon, the boys started their
drills by first swimming 100 -yards
and then by kicking their feet while
holding onto the ledge along the
side of the pool for ten minutes
without a stop.

Tuesday’s practice was more ar-
duous for the future Weismuellers.
The boys started off by swimming
220 yards, then kicked for seven
consecutive minutes and t_opped_off
the day’s work by swimming thirty
widths of the pool, a distance of
300 yards. ' —

Practice sessions will

and Penn State in succession.

The Cleveland school which has
a student enrollment of twelve
thousand has been trying for the
past few. years to build up its foot-
ball reputation to a position beﬁt-
ting the size of the school and they
have been coming right along, but
at the present time they can hard-
ly present enough opposition to

cause any worry in the Panther
ranks.
A few years ago the Cleveland

school lured Karl E. Davis, then

raduate manager of athletics at
Pitt, away from here to accept the
position as manager of the West-
ern Reserve Athletic Publicity
Service with duties there the same
as that which he had at Pitt.

Reserve Improving

The records of the Cleveland
football teams since the arrival of
Davis show an increasing number
of victories for the Reservemen, but
several more years will elapse be-
fore the'Red Cats will be able to
compete with the major teams of
the country on even. terms.

The Ohioans are ‘coached by Gor-
don Locke, former All-American
fullback at the -University of Iowa.
Locke is assisted by George Thomp-
son, former teammate of Locke.at
Iowa and now head line coach at
Western ‘Reserve; Ra Dauber. 811-
other ex-Iowa star an present back-,
ﬁeld coach for they Clevelanders;
Jack Davis, former Reserve foot-
ball player, and Roy Clifford, who
is also mentor of the Red Cat's
cage team,

Western Reserve has a heavy
team this year with the regular line
averaging 193 pounds and the back-
ﬁeld averaging slightly over 170
pounds. The team is also -one of
the youngest in intercollegiate. foot-
ball. The average age of the. squad
members is 20 years and five of the
boys'are but eighteen years of age.

Sophomores Mainstays

Although the -Red Cats have
twelve-lettermen from last year’s
team, they will place their main
hopes for ‘a- successful

omores who were the mainstays of
R_eserve’s undefeated freshman
team last year.

, These sophomores are Hank Slo-
movitz, 215-pound center, who has
beaten out Vic Hurd, regular pivot
man in. 1929; Eddie Robinson, a
193-pound guard; Elmer Wayne,
175-pound halfback, and Eddie Fin-
ni an, .155-pound quarterback.

By DICK GOTTRON

Sport Editor, Reserve Wetldy

Reserve looks forward to the
; Pittsburgh game not as to one in
3 ..>«:- which a home victory can be ex-
* pected, for the Red Cats do not an-
 |,.‘.;. ticipate a win. Coach Locke will
0‘  have his men in to put up the best
i “‘ ﬁght of their careers. h°WeVe!‘. and
the Panthers may count on _being
faced by a game, scrappy outﬁt.

In her opening game last week,
Reserve went down to an 18-0 de-
feat adminis%3rﬁd by {he Strfngc
Muskin m o ege eeven, as
year’s gvtinner of the Ohio Confer-
. ence title. In that game, a back-
 «-... .ﬁeld composed of three men entire-
 ‘“"""1y new to Resei-ve’s colors, and a

fourth who had had very little pre-
vious varsity ball carrying experi-
ence, made its debut, and showed a
' great store of offensive power.’ All
four of A the starting backs, who
were namely, Finegan at quarter,
Wayne and Kelly at halfs, and
Spohn at full, are capable runners,
and the ﬁrst two named posses, be-
sides, considerable power as pass-
ers and punters. The line, largely
composed of veterans, isn't ex-

, pected to meet its equal in weight

and more than ﬁfteen thousand
alumni. There, surely, is material
and backing for good athletics.

Moreover, the realization has just
recently come, perhaps largely as
the result‘ of the installation here
of Karl E. Davis as‘ Alumni Secre-
tary and Publicity Manager, that
Cleveland, with hundreds of thou-
sands of fans, is one of America's
greatest undeveloped football cen-
ters. A huge municipal stadium is
under the process of construction,
and beginning next year, it will be
the site of all Red Cat football en-
counters. It will have a seating
capacity of 125,000, and it is Re-
serve’: intention to develop so good
a’ team as to draw crowds that Will
ﬁll that huge bowl to its very

limits. .
Look To Future

So, although Reserve expects to
lose an occasion game or two now,
sheis looking to the future as a
time when far different results may
logically be expected. At present
she hopes to establish a friendship
with Pitt, which, begun at this
game, will be renewed twice again
during the year at basketball frays,
here and in Pittsburgh. With the
end in view of making the Panther
trip to Cleveland as enjoyable as
possible, extensive arrangements are
being» made to provide entertain-
ment for the visitors. Among other
features on the program is a lunch-
eon, just before the game, for
Pittsburgh alumni. Open house
will be a policy of most of the Re-
serve fraternities and Lambda‘ Chi
Alpha, Phi Gamma Delta, Sigma
Chi and Delta Tau Delta, the only
four having Pittsburgh chapters,
are arranging dances in the eve-
ning. -
So, although Reserve may not be
able to win, she'll at least be a
game -loser, a worthy foe and a
good host-—-and she'll be looking
forward to a time not so far distant
when the terms of combat will be

Andfor a closing remark-—the best alibi that a freshman had for

“Primo” Valenti Loses
Fifty Pounds Since
Early September

 

Whenever you pass the old ath-
letic ﬁeld and the Pitt freshmen_are
practicing, you will see the curious
sight of a hu bulk of humanit

racing around and around the ﬁel .
There will be a little man throwing

snap out of it," “Get the lead out
of your feet” and other such cracks.

"This big man takes these cracks

from this little fellow, and he likes
it, or rather, he has to like It.

The big man is John Valenti, “the
Prime Camera" of the Pitt fresh-
man football squad, and the little
fellow is Dr. “Skip” Gou ler, coach
of the frosh gridders. ow do you
wonder why “Primo” takes it and
likes it? _

A When John first went to the Pitt
football camp, he weighed twoih_un-
dred and ninety pounds, but since
Coach Gougler has been working
him like a horse, he has come down
to a mere two hundred forty

pounds. Anygirls who have tried

dieting as a weight reducer, and
have sen unsuccessful should come
up to the old athletic ﬁeld and ask
for Doctor Gougler who guarantees
to remove excess baggage, and
doesn't even charge for it. “Skip”
is also handsome, which is another
ﬁiducement for the girls.
v But etting back to “Primo,”
Coach Gougler is having quite a
time ﬁnding the right position for
the big boy. He has tried him at
tackle, guard and center on the line
but is still undecided where to start
him in the freshman game with the
George Washington freshmen to-
night.

At the guard post, “Primo” has
been found too slow to come out of
the line for interference so it is
doubtful whether he will be found
there in the opener. But at the
tackle and center berths, Valenti
has been showing to advantage. It
is most likely that Coach Gougler
will use him at center as there are
two ood tackles on the freshman
squa now. Wait till you see this
Valenti boy in action!

Rockne Has

 Fine Record

Famous Coach Loses But 13
Games In 17 Years

 

 

 Knute Rockne, coach of the Notre
Dame football team, has compiled
an envious record at the South Bend
liool ever since he took over the

‘co-aching-«reins there in 1913.

His teams have won 102 games
to date while losing 13, an average
of less than one defeat a season.
Rockne had undefeated teams in
1919, 1920, 1924 and 1929. In the
latter two years, the Ramblers were
recognized as national champions.
1924 Team Best

Rockne considers the 1924 team
the best he ever coached. The team
that year boasted of the famous
“Four Horsemen“ in the backﬁeld
and the almost as famous “Seven
Mules” on the line.

Two of the young men who played
on that team are coaching teams in
this district. Elmer Layden, the
fullback, is coach of the Du uesne
University team, while Clem rowe,
an end, is coach of the St. Vincent's
College team of Latrobe, Pa.

The worst season the Irish ever
had was in 1928 when they -won
five games, while losin four to
Wisconsin, Southern California, Car-
negie Tech and Georgia Tech.
Rockne explains the poor record by
saying that he had no “shock troops”
that year.

Expect Good Year

~ This year, Rockne ex ects to have
another great team. e lost his en-
tire ﬁrst string line and Jack Elder,
.his best running back, from last
year's team, but he expects the vet-
erans from his 1929 “shock troops”
to uphold the honor of the South
Bend school. '

Knute is worrying over onl two
teams this year, Carne ie Tec and
Southern California. his may not
be very good news to Pitt sup-
porters but then George McLaren,

enerally considered the best full-

ack to ever represent the Panthers,
is willin to bet $500 that Pitt will
beat Tee by two touchdowns, news
which may not sound so sweet to
Rockne in case he ever hears it.

The four yearlings who burned

Three other likely looking fresh-

It is uncertain as to who will line

up for the frosh, as Skip Gougler
will not make known his announce-
ment until game time. At the ends
he has his choice -of Hartwig, Craft,
Vincent and Skladany. The two
who made the best appearance in
workouts to date are Skladany and
Craft. Vincent and Hartwig are
sure to break in the game as they
have been ﬁghting hard to take the
ﬁrst team berth.

Love At Tackle

At the tackle positions will be

These two boys have been making
it tough for the varsity boys in the
scrimmages.

At the guard posts, Smith and
Onder are the two probable start-
ers. These boys are fast and rangy
and know how to come out of a
‘line to form interference for the
backs. They will be a great help
to Jock Sutherland’s teams in the
future.

At center position will be found

Cap & Gown
Opens Season

Music, Skits For Next Show
Received Until December

 

 

 

Plunging into its season several
weeks earlier than usual, the Cap
and Gown Club announces that con-
tributions of music, lyrics or skits
from students are now being re-
ceived by Walter Rome, graduate
manager of student activities, for
possible use in next spring’s show.
These contributions may be given
to the graduate manager until De-
cember . ~

Announcement was also made
during the past week that the man-
agement of the Cap and Gown
show would be put under dual re-
sponsibility this season with both
a business manager and a produc-
tion manager. Those selected for
these posts are Richard Piefer, Col.
’32, and Jules Witt, Col. ’31, respec-
tively. The two men succeed Ed-
ward Burchard, Col. ’31, who was
forced to resign the management
because of other University work.

The club will probably formally

Ericson Heads
New Project

Freshman Women To Form
Own Class Committees

 

A new project for the organiza-
tion of freshman women has been
planned this year by the Women’s
Self Government Association, under
the chairmanship of Naomi Ericson,
Ed. ’31, vice president of W. S. G.
A., formerly chairman of the pub-
licity committee, the vice president
this year, will supervise organiza-
tions, turning over publicity work
to the chairman of publications,
Sara Josselson, Col. ’32.

The plan proposed is that fresh-
man women work on a committee
in the class organization instead of
serving on committees in the vari-
ous organizations on the campus.

“In previous years, freshmen
have been permitted to enter the
different women’s organizations and
serve in the capacity of committee
members, thus crowding out more
experienced upperclasswomen and
causing them to lose interest,” de-
clares Miss Ericson. “This method,
beside not being fair to the older
women, W. S. G. A. feels has hin-
dered the freshmen, since the pos-
sibility of working in so many ac-
tivities,has withheld them from be-
coming familiar with any certain
one.” '

_Th_e committees, which will be
withinthe class, will be under the
supervision of experienced upper-
c_la_sswomen and will consist of pub-
licity, program, social and any
other that the class selects, en-
abling every woman to choose the
committee in which she is especially
interested. During the year the
different organizations will call
upon these freshman groups to
work for them as sub-committees,
and in this way the new woman will
be able to view the range of activi-
ties so that in her sophomore year
she can choose knowingly the organ-
ization in which she wishes to be
active. “W. S. G. A..has given care-
ful thought to this proposition,”
concluded Miss Ericson, “and if it
proves successful, a similar idea
will be initiated in the upper-
classes.” ‘ I

Group Will Have Drum
And Bugle Corps At

Gridiron Contests

A special order of Col. Cullen of
the Pitt battalion made drastic
changes in the battalion oﬁicers’ per-
sonnel effective Oct. 1st. In addi-
tion to Capt. H. A. McLean as Bat-
talion Commander and Lieut. R. J.
Remaley in the post of Cadet Adju-

tant, the order names Lieutenant J .
Gallick (Eng.) as Supply Oﬁicer
and Sgt. L. R. Black (Eng-) and
Sgt. E. H. Black (Eng.) in the ca-
pacity of color sergeants. ‘

The order names ninety-four men
as sergeants‘ and corporals in the
four batteries comprising the bat-‘
talion. In addition the order names
forty-two sergeants and corporals
for the battalion band and R. F.
Hogue in the capacity of drum
major. The oﬂicers for the twenty-
four piece drum corps which has
been recentl organized were named
as Sgts. J. . McCormick and P. W.
Thomas; corporals, A. Bachman
W. P. Carlin, W. J. Edwards and
G. S. Kellar.

The local R. O.  C. office,

nounced the organization of a twen-
ty-four piece bugle and drum corp_s.
Sixteen bugles and eight drums will
form this year’s unit. - It was fur-
thermore added that the bugle and
drum corps would appear behind the

ging football spirit which character-
izes Pitt football stands, Lieutenant
Wilson announces that the entire
battalion will parade behind the
band and bugle and drum_ corps.
The cadets have been assigned a
special reserved section which they
will occupy’ during the game. Each
cadet will be require to carry a
megaphone which wi be brought
into use during the cheering peri-
ods. In speaking of this move on
the part of the battalion chiefs,
Lieut. Wilson said, “We hope _to
bolster the weakest part of the Pitt
team-—the cheering section. The ad-
dition of the R. O. T. C. section, we
hope, will prove a great aid to the
Pitt cheerleaders.”

Gas   Grads Make

Important Discoveries

 

  

   

 

By ARTHUR GOLDBERG

Lying in a depression and con-
cealed by the towering walls of the
stadium is a little known but high-
ly important department of the
school of mines and minerology.
This department, the Gas and Oil
department, is housed in a box-like
brick structure adjacent to which
is the frame buildings in which the
class and drawing rooms are con-
tained.

The department‘ is devoted to the P

training and development of Petro-
Ieum engineers and geologists to
whom we owe our warmth and com-
fort, our mechanical speed and
transportation, for the discovery of
oil and gas deposits. The curricu-
Ium has been somewhat enlarged
this year by the addition of several
courses in Petroleum engineering
differentiating it from Petroleum
geology.

Past students of this department
have been extremely active during
the past summer contributing inval-

Alumni Plan
Homecoming

Carson Will Direct Events
Before Notre Dame Game

Plans for the annual homecoming
of Pitt alumni for the Notre‘ Dame
game are being advanced by George
Carson, alumni secretary, the ath-
letic council and interfraternity
council. Luncheons for out-of-town

alumni and fraternit dances will
feature the week-end when several
hundred alumni from a distance are
expected to be present.

Fraternities will again compete
for the best decorated house, three
cups, donated by the athletic coun-
cil, goin to the winners for those
houses s owing the most originality
in their decorative scheme.‘ The
same rules as prevailed last year
when houses were decorated for the
Ohio State game, including the pro-
vision where no professional deco-
rators may be employed, will be in
effect this year, accordin to Theo-
dore Biddle, assistant to t e dean of
men.

Reservations are now being made

uable data by means of literature,
and actually locating the wells and
oil deposits. Lieut. W. H. Osgood,
graduate‘ of Annapolis, who was
sent here to study in the ﬁeld of
Petroleum engineering, has pub-
lished an important work, “Increas-
ing the recovery of Petroleum.”
Lieut. Osgood has since been as-
signed to the Teapot Dome, naval
oil reserve. This work was the sec-
ond to appear, being preceded by
“Oil Prospecting,” written by a Mr.
anyity, also a graduate.

Also during the past summer, the
largest gas well which has been
struck in years in Pennsylvania,
was located by another graduate,
Mr. Jack Gaddes, geologist of the
Allegheny Gas Co. Mr. Paul Tor-
rey, not to be outdone by a fellow
alumnus, discovered the last previ-
ous important well in the northern
Appalachian ﬁeld.

In all, this little exploited but ex-
traordinary department has ren-
dered valuable service in its scien-
tiﬁc ﬁeld.

by the alumni secretary for the Sat-
urday luncheons which will be held
in the University Club, Pittsburgh
Athletic Association and Hotel
Schenley. A program, to ‘be an-
nounced next week, is expected to
include an inspection trip through
the Cathedral of Learning.

More than 3,000 Notre Dame stu-
dents are also expected to come to
this game, having selected it for
the annual student pilgrimage from
South Bend.

330 Couples Attend
First College Dance

The University’s social season was

ballroom of the Schenley hotel
where 330 couples, the largest alt-
tendance present at any College As-
sociation affair, danced to the music
of the Moore.-Stump orchestra.

' Seasonal decorations brightened
the ballroom, and" unique lighting
_effects sent vari-colored rays across
the. ﬂoor. Gerard P. Hammill, ’31,
chairman of the affair, had on his
committee Marie Brackinan, ’31, Es-
telle Logan, '32; George Boggs, Jr.,
'31; John Crumrine, —’32; Robert
Kleeb, ’31, and Roger Currier, ’32.
