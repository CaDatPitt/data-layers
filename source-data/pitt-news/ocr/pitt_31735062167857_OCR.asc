Loch Discusses New Union

by JUDY VOLLMER
Staff Writer

The development of a new
Student Union for the Univer-
sity was discussed" in a report
to the Education and Student
Affairs Committee of the
Board of Trustees and the Un-
ion Advisory Committee by John
R. Loch, director of the Student
Union.

Loch feels that since the Union
is serving a campus body which
is primarily an undergraduate
commuter student body, a faculty
which commutes from suburban
areas, and an ever-increasing

part-time student body, it is im- -

portant to turn to the Union for a
central area of recreation and in-
formation.

In his report Loch stated sever-
al reasons why the present facil-
ity is inadequate. saying that only
35 per cent of the offices on the
first five floors of the Union pro-

vide space ‘for the recognized‘

campus organizations and Stu-
dent Affairs staff offices.

He continued that only two con-
ference rooms will accommodate
100 or more people, while others
lack adequate lighting. For an en-
rollment of approximately 22,000,
the entire recreational facilities
of the Union include four table ten-
nis units, 12 billiard tables, and
three _coin-operated games. “The
Oakland recreational facilities
are at a saturation point, also,”
stated Loch.

Loch also brought out that there
is only one place. the ‘Ballroom.
to hold a well-attended program.
“The Union Ballroom. the Steph-
en Foster Memorial. and the Com-
mon Facilities Auditorium are not
now adequate for program pur-
poses. and they will become more
completely inadequate as the en-
rollment increases.“ he added.

for a new Union. Loch has in-
cluded in his report a three phase
plan for renovating and improv-
ing Schenley Hall.

One of the proposals now being
considered by the Union Advisory
Committee is the idea of a wrap-
around facility to complement and
expand the facilities in the present
Union. This construction would to-
tal an area of 100,000 square feet
on the part of the Union facing Big-
elow Blvd., where the Union lawn
is now located and would continue
around the sides of the building.

The wrap—arou-nd structure
would rise to approximately three
or four stories at the highest. be-
cause. as Loch stated. “Vertical
expansion is difficult. especially
with the congestion in the Union
elevators now."

A second proposal would be the
complete renovation of the pre-
sent Schenley Hall and the conver-
sion of this facility into Union fa-
cilities. A gross square footage
of 79,000 square feet would be pro-
vided for Union facilities. The fa-

cilities would fall into several
categories. including: meeting

and conference rooms. recrea-
tional facilities. food service
areas. campus activity work

areas. and student health services.

The third phase is the addition
of new Union facilities to provide
for expanding campus needs after
1973-74. The project proposal
is being submitted to the General
State Authority.

Loch explained that the empha-
sis of the plannings for a better
Union is to build in the direction
of a governance more effective
and central to the needs of stu-
dents.

“The Union is. most important-
ly. a social and educational cen-
ter. Students can come here to
find out just what is going on cul-
turally. both on campus and in
Oakland. Commuters should have
the opportunity to participate in
the same activities and education-
al areas that the resident students
do. and the Union can give them
that opportunity."

 

THE DEADLINE DATE to re-apply for Student
Aid for the Fall Term 1970 is March '|5th for
Applications and Re-Newal . . . Parents con-

fidential Statement may be picked up in~
the Student Aid Office, 325 Schenley Hall.

DEADLINE FOR AID FOR THE SPRING TERM
IS MARCH lst.

 

 Students Form   C0,n:nl'SSi0n

Sex Information Board

As an information and refer-
ence bureau. 15 third year medi-
cal students have banded togeth-
er to form the Medical Students‘
Sex Information Bureau. Trained
clinically with the special direc-
tion of Dr. Ronald Chez. professor
of Obstetrics and Gynecology at
the University. the group is now
available for 40 minute lectures
in the areas of conception. contra-
ception. human sexual response.
abortion and veneral diseases.

According to the president and
spokesman for the Bureau. Mike
Aptman. the lecturing will hope-
fully serve as a “jumping off point
for discussion and questioning
from the floor."

The group has a two-fold pur-
pose: to provide authorative in-
formation in the area of human
sexuality for lay groups limited
to between 15 and 50 members and
to -offer referrals for individuals
who approach the speakers with a
problem.  ‘ y g  

Home-based at the University.
the city-wide program is present-
ly operating for the colleges and
universities in the area. but even-
tually plans to reach the high
schools as well.

Aptman revealed that the par-
ticipants in the program prefer to
talk to "people who know one an-
other“ in order to facilitate unin-
hibited questioning and open dis-
cussion in sensitive areas. They
will speak before any group that
commissions them.

Although there is no fee, the
Bureau requests that $10 be con-
tributed from each session to cov-
er the expenses of audio-visual
material and mailing costs.

Anyone interested in procuring
the Bureau for a group lecture
may do so by contacting the office
of the associate dean of the School
of Medicine. telephone 683-1620,
ext. 337. The medical students
‘participating have been formally
trained in sensitivity group dy-
namics.

This Friday a no-curfew
system for all upperclass
women will ‘go into effect. The
new system will not require
parental permission, and sign-
out procedures will be volun-
tary.

An ad hoc committee composed
of the Women‘s Residence Hall
Judicial Board proposed the reg-
ulations and rationale for the no-
curfew system. According to
Women's Housing Board. the in-
stitution of this system will be a
definite step in eliminating the
"double standard” prevalent in
men's and women‘s residence hall
regulations;

The vote concerning the adop-
tion of a no-curfew system was
conducted in each residence hall
last November. Of the 1.295 up-

» perclass women eligible to vote.

1.135 (87 per cent) did so. The re-
sults of the referendum were 1.097

V in favor. 38 opposed.

According to Liz Rock, chair-
man of the board, Women’s Hous-
ing Board agrees to undertake the
responsibility each year of com-
municating the rationale and reg-
ulations of this system to the par-
ents of all eligible women-and also
of orienting those women in the
system’s regulations and proce-
dures.

The new system places upon the
student. not the University. the
responsibility to insure that infor-
mation is available through which
she can be reached in an emergen-
cy when she is not in the vicinity
of her residence hall. It is assum-
ed that parental regulation of the
student’s behavior is the concern

Opens Hearings 

A nine-member commission has
been named to investigate alter-
natives to the present Student
Government (SG) structure.

Letters To Legislators

  Financial Crisis Necessitates Action

by DAVE TIERNAN
Editor

In response to the State Legis-
lature’s delay in appropriating
funds to Penn State, Temple and
the University, the three school’s
-student papers are conducting a
letter-writing campaign to urge
immediate action.

As the Universities begin their
seventh month of operation with-

out their State appropriations, lit-
tle or no other action is being un-
dertaken to urge actions

Here at the University Senate
Council meeting of Jan. 19, a reso-
lution was passed calling for Sen-_
ate officers to meet with admin-
istrators to discuss possible ac-
tion. V

Trustees took no formal action to
study possible courses of action.

If no action is taken by the State
by Feb. 21, and according to a
statement made recently by Chan-
cellor Wesley Posvar this is quite
possible. the three schools will or-
ganize other actions such as vis-
its of students to Harrisburg or
urging that the three schools close
their doors until the appropria-
tions are given.

Without the appropriations. the
three schools ha ve been forced to
borrow monies from banks to
meet budgetary needs. The Uni-
versity has already borrowed be-
tween 18 and 20 million dollars.
and is currently paying approxi-
mately $5.000 a day in interest.
Penn State is reported to be pay-
ing close to $6,000 per day in in-
terest.

This interest will not be reim-
bursed by the State when they
finally do appropriate funds, and
rumors at Penn State indicate that
this will result in a substantial
tuition increase, possibly doubl-

A ing or even tripling the present

tuition.

In addition to possible tuition in-
creases, students also suffer from
the State’s delay by having to at-
tend over-crowded ‘classes.

As a convenience to students.
the papers are printing a letter
that may be clipped from the pa-
per, signed by either students or
their parents. and mailed to State
Legislators.

CUT THIS LETTER OUT AND MAIL IT
IMMEDIATELY TO YOUR STATE LEGISLATOR!

Dear Legislator,

I am writing to you to express my concern for the
University of Pittsburgh’s financial appropriation
from the State.

It has been brought to my attention that delay
in appropriating monies to the University has caused
them to borrow money from banks, resulting in daily
interest payments as high as $5,000.00.

I also understandthat when the money is appro-
priated, no compensation will be made for these in-
terest payments.

Therefore, every day you delay your appropria-
tion, it is costing the University money. This affects
me in higher tuition rates and the University’s inabil-
ity to hire badly needed faculty members.

Thus, I urge you to do everything in your power
to appropriate the monies as quickly as possible.

Thank you,

Watartable Off To Hawaii Finally Feels “Alive”

by BOB BON N
Staff Writer

A slightly different sort of feel-
ing is in the air in the YMCA of-
fice these days. Oh. yes, the pro-
jects still are going on, but some-
thing is different.

Frank Watanabe is leaving for
the University of Hawaii.

Watanabe, whose official title
is executive secretary has been
the director of YMCA projects for
five years. Under him, the Uni-
versity YMCA has taken on pro-
jects such as tutoring underpriv-
ileged children. introducing high
school students to what college is
like, and a variety of other pro-
jects designed to develop student
skills for vocational and humane
reasons.

What are the reflections of a
man who has spent five years of
his life working with and for Uni-
versity students? Says Watanabe,
“The University is moving in the
right direction as far as concerns
for the community. But the Uni-
versity certainly has a vast vari-
ety of areas in which to grow.”

Watanabe fits into the campus-
community relationship via the
YMCA projects. which are done
by University students for the
community, "the premise being
helping others to help themselves
and thereby also helping your-
self Watanabe explains.

Watanabe hesitated when que-
ried as to what hisfavorite pro-
ject was. "Each one has a built—in
happiness." he said. The service
projects for the community rated
high in his recollections. In these.
he said. the student takes on job
responsibility and learns how he
relates to youngsters. "People . . .

  
   

that’s what the things all about.
really."

Similarly, Watanabe hesitated
when asked about his biggest dis-
appointments. “One is not able to
do everything for everybody,” he
said, “and must be able to do
something for somebody.”

Watanabes main role was that
of teacher. By using YMCA pro-
jects as a method of developing
student skills. "our projects beget
a kind of relevance supplementing
classroom curriculum."

Watanabes future at Hawaii
will involve a similar _role. al-

though Hawaii does have a larger
student body and more facilities.
Watanabe is particularly enthused
about the diverse ethnic back-
ground of his new students.

A dynamic man and a dynamic
leader. Watanabe will be missed.

The Commuter Association
(CA) is alive. well and residing in
1217 CL.

After many false starts in the
past. the ‘ feels that in 1970 it
will bx, . "'e to struggle out of ob-
livion anu L“o an important. use-
ful position on campus.

Most of the credit for reorgan-
izing the a"-ociation should be
given to its advisor. Chenits Pet-
tigrew. assistant to the dean of
students. Pettigrew started this
year‘s CA from scratch last tri-
mester by asking interested com-
muters to sign up for the associa-
the 12th floor. This
month, Pettigrew again asked
these commuters to come to some
meetings in 1217 CL to begin re-
organizing CA.

At the past two meetings, pro-

jects have been proposed for the

CA: a meal ticket program, a
commuter lounge, more and
cheaper parking lots, a place
where commuters could stay over-
night, and a sheltered bus stop in
front of Hillman Library.

One of the first projects CA is
to take on is the meal ticket pro-
gram which commuters would be
able to use at the Schenley and
Towers Cafeterias. Lee Elder.
who worked on this project last
year, is in charge of the program.

Another definite CA aim is the
commuter lounge. CA has already
been given 360-CL to use for the
lounge. Pettigrew is working with
the administration to get the
room furnished for commuters’
use by spring.

CA has also been promised the
practice field near the Fitzgerald
Field House as a parking lot if and
when Pitt Stadium gets Astroturf.

As another project, CA is send-
ing Pettigrew and two or three CA
members to Wayne State Univer-
sity in Detroit to learn about some
of the innovations commuters
have made in that school.

At the last CA meeting tempor-
ary officers were chosen: Paul
Hensler, president; Tom Gainan,
vice-president; Jacalyn Schwartz,
corresponding secretary, and Kar-
en Samuels, recording secretary.

All of the projects have desig-
nated committees to work on
them. but more members are
needed not only for committee

work but also for general CA sup- W

port.

The Bust List

by JEFF CASHER‘
Contributing Writer

You hear the phrase three or

. ‘four times a year. We have just
0 heard it for the second time this

year—that phrase is Bust Day. or

I  as some people call it, B-Day. I

have heard a few people refer to
it as Bust-D.

By Bust Day, I don't mean a
,day when all girls go without bras

itnot that it wouldn't be such a bad
' idea, that is to go sans brassiere).

Bust Day. actually, is the suppos-
ed day when all of the Umversity

 community. tlorms. fraternity
houses, apartments.
H commuters

and even
(Jack LaPietra.
where are you?) should be on the

" look-out for a narcotics raid.

According to unrealiable au-«
_ thorities (people in Tower B snack

bar). there is a list of student nar-
cotics users that the police have.
A lot of people are on the lists It
has become a status thing to be on
it. And, if you're not on it. it's al-
most as good to know someone

{ who is. Here is a sample dialogue

between two lists — conscious
drug-users: “Hey, man, guess

what? They have a list and I-heard

my name is on it. Too bad. man.

_ yours isn't."

“YOU MEAN your name is on
the list and mine isn't‘? Maybe
they haven't heard about the mes-
caline trip I did last week."

This latest scare places Bust

‘Day on the calendar as the second

of February. There are rumors
that a petition is going around the
campus trying to make that day a
University holiday. I. myself. can
agree with this because it would
give all students (and maybe fac-
ulty) a day-off to clean-up their
residences of all bits of danger-
ous narcoti.

The culmination of this would
be that on the evening of the sec-
ond. we would all gather in the
Commons Room of the Cathedral.
If that room fills up. we could use
room 314 or maybe even the Na-
tionality Rooms.

ONCE EVERYBODY is in a
room. we will bring out all of the
varied illegal drugs we had col-

lected that day and we could stage

a massive drug sit-in. Then. for
anybody who is capable of mov-

ing. we will have a bonfire at Bub-'
bles Field using any drugs that
are left.

So. if you're not doing anything
on the second of February. or if
you don't know where to stash
your drugs. join the fun here at
school. That's Feb. 2. Bust Day.

if Fixation With Beauty

by DON MARBURY
News Editor

How does one fight a fixation with physical beauty‘? Think about

. all the times you've heard someone say that beauty's only skin deep.

You might have nodded your head that they were right. but how
many of you know deep down in your hearts that there wasn't any-
way in the world that you were going to marry or even date someone

who didn't "look good?"

Every week you can read something about some beauty contest.
where women are judged by their bodies and facial features. These
contests might claim that their contestants‘ intelligence and talents

-play a great part in their evaluations. but its a good bet that for a
- woman with a naturally rough complexion. or a birth detect. a lisp.

or small breats. it would be considered heresy to even think about

considering her for a contestant.

Don‘t you honor people for what they have done——what they by
their own powers have accomplished‘? What did anyone have to do
with the way they look. Not their appearance. but the actual way in
which their face is shaped, or their nose is placed. or the size of their

l.ips. or their basic shape?

A BEAUTY contest is nothing more than what kids used to do to
the little girl in their kindergarden class. who was a little over-
weight. or to the little boy that they playfully named "bumpy-face.“
Nothing more than children accepting those. who are as they think
they should be. and rejecting those who are the least bit deviant

from their grand ideals.

Do we respect a man. who emerges as a millionaire. if his fath-
er left him two million dollars in his will to begin with‘?

McGovern Begs Unity 

(Editor's Note: The following remarks were made
by Senator George McGovern, Democrat, South Dako-
ta, before the National Press Club in Washington Jan.
19. They are reprinted here so that our readers may
be exposed to the views of a national political figure.)

The beginning of a new decade. with the
Congress reconvening and the Administration
starting its second year. is a good time for a man
in public life to speak to the National Press Club.

As we enter the 1970's. our nation is in trou-.
ble. primarily. I believe. because we still follow
a leadership focusing its major energies on ex-
ternal fears instead of internal neglect.

For thirty years —— since the traumatic shock
of Pearl Harbor. we have been preoccupied with
war and preparation for war. Most of our nation-
alenergy. most of our federal taxes. most of our
national debt. most of the inflation. most of the
dissension —— all of these have been the hand-
maidens of war and the arms race.

Meanwhile,
nal weaknesses have been allowed to tester until
they threaten our survival as a society of dignity
and freedom. In the name of national defense,
we have been exhausting the sources of national
defense. “'

The key question of 1970 is the same one I
raised as a freshman Senator seven years ago:
Can we turn away from endless war and con-
tain the military monster that is devouring our
resources so greedily as to disarm the nation
against its most serious dangers at home‘?

The first duty of a public man in 1970 is to
recognize that if we do not seriously address our-
selves to this question with a radical new urgen-
cy and restructuring of our policies and institu-
tions. we may well lose our sense of community

and nationhood.

In 1969, the President fought for new billions
to build the ABM and a whole range of doubt-
ful new weapons systems. Now he has vowed to
veto the Health, Education and Welfare bill be-
cause the Congress has added a billion dollars
more than he requested.

It is true that our President has expressed
concern about the nations problems. In his 1968
campaign. he dwelt on four of them — crime. in-
flation. division and Vietnam. But 1969 again of-
fers clear proof that more than rhetoric is need-
ed to heal the nation's troubles.

The President kept his pledge to fire Attor-
ney General Ramsey Clark as a prescription for

‘law and order. But the crime rate increased an-

other 10 per cent in 1969 and rose even more
alarmingly in the Nations Capital.

Inflation now races ahead at the highest an-
nual rate in 20 years, and interest rates are at
an all-time high. The 1969 cost of living advanc-
ed nearly 6 per cent, as compared to 4 per cent
in 1968.

The southern strategy has further divided

‘ blacks and whites. while the harsh indictments

of the Vice President and the Attorney General
have widened the gap between the nation's ideal-
ists and their government.

Meanwhile. the war in Vietnam continues
with another 11.000 Americans dead in 1969 -
with no end in sight.

The Administration in its first year has dealt
not so much with our problems as with the poli-
tics of those problems. It has sought not toend
mistaken policies and priorities but to end criti-
cism. Its goal has been to isolate the dissatisfied
citizens of the nation, while claiming to repre-
sent the nation's majority interests.

The hallmark of this Administration is the
politics of manipulation. when what is most
needed is the reconciliation of the nation behind
more constructive goals.

There is both an official.
and an unofficial backdoor policy.

front-door policy

The official policy has been to elevate a
cheerful blandness to the status of a national vir-
tue. Voices are lowered, silence is encouraged,
earnestness is emphasized, controversy discour-
aged.

Studies become a substitute for action. Con-
ferences are more important than programs. De-
cisions take a back seat to coordination. Policy
councils become ends in themselves rather than
preludes to action. Public relations replaces per-
formance.

The official theme is. thus. ordered sweetness
and light. It seeks to allay the fearful and dis-
arm the concerned.

But the bland face of the Administration also
serves to distract attention from its unofficial
policy. And that is anything but bland.

It works the backstreets. It seeks to discredit
those who disagree. It sets group against group.
It tries to frighten the news media, turn old

against young, and isolate those who oppose its

war policy. - . e V

the nation's most serious inter-

What I object to most strongly is the method
the Administration has chosen to repress the in-
teraction of dissent and response that is so vital
to the survival of a democratic system.

The President summons forth in his support
what he calls the silent majority —- an exercise
that presumes silence to be a virtue and outcry
a sin. It presumes further that silence is respec-
table and protest the threatening howl of the
mob.

The Vice President, as always, is willing to
put it more bluntly. He calls what is happening
in America today “positive polarization.” In ef-
fect, Americans are asked to choose sides -
against each other. We are asked to eliminate
those who dissent too vigorously as we would rot-
ten apples in the barrel.

The President's pledge "bring us together"
now appears a determination to bring the right
people together. And the right people. presum-
ably. are those who are content with things as.
they are and hostile to those who would change
them. It follows that the wrong people must be
those who are dissatisfied. who seek change.

Some might find comfort in polarization. but
it frightens me. It frightens me that we are wit-
nessing the beginning of political apartheid in
this country. which casts the silent as Brahmans
and those who dissent as untouchables.

If the demands of dissenting Americans
were unjust or ignoble, then we could turn
away. But what they seek is an end to a fool-
ish war, and end to racial injustice, an end to
hunger and misery and ugliness and pollution.
They seek, in short, to probe the nation's con-
science by underscoring the gap between rhetoric

.and reality.

_ Is not this coalition of conscience on ‘higher
ground than the coalition of silence?

Let us understand that the consequences of
spurning the legitimate claims of the young and
other disaffected citizens of our land would be
enormous. America was conceived and developed
by the idealism and driving energy of the young.
combined with the efforts of the dissatisfied who
settled the country. We need to ponder what it
means to live in a society that has lost the confi-
dence. the enthusiasm. and the contributions of

yearning minds. Let us remember that this na-‘

tion was conceived. its independence won. and its
Constitution constructed by a vigorous minority
who carried the day against the hostility of apa-
thy of the majority.

What would it cost our nation now for dis-
satisfied Americans to turn away from participa-
tion in our public life because of disillusionment
over our political process‘?

Conversely. silent majorities have not always
been right. as witness Hitler's debauchery of the
German nation while the people applauded or
stood silent. This was the same nation that pro-
duced Beethoven. Goethe. and Einstein. History
is f'illed with the wreckage of foolish or barber
policies that were temporarily accepted by silent
majorities. I find silence a questionable virtue
in the presence of injustice. hypocrisy and neg-
lect. ‘

Frankly, I reject the notion that there is a
silent majority of Americans satisfied with the
present state of our society. As a middle-class,
middle-aged man from middle America, I find
my neighbors and constituents dissatisfied with
the quality of life in 1970. Their taxes are also
being squandered on wasteful military spending.

Their sons are also going off to Vietnam. They-

are also paying the heavy price of inflation, high
interest, shoddy merchandise and a disorderly so-
ciety.

All Americans are victimized by the present
policies and priorities of the nation. Millions of
Americans who may be silent are nevertheless
ready for a leadership that would unite them
with their'dissenting fellow Americans in a com-
mon effort to face up to the nation's needs.

What would be the agenda of such a leader-
ship‘? I suggest the following:

 (1) An end to our involvement in the Vietnam
war. beginning with an immediate ceasefire. in-
cluding the cessation of bombardment that is now
destroying the Vietnamese countryside. Our forc-
es should be deployed entirely in maximum de-
fensive arrangements with their withdrawal tak-
ing place as soon as we arrange for the release
of prisoners and asylum in friendly countries for
those Vietnamese who might feel threatened by
our withdrawal.

(2) A reduction in the military budget of $50
billion in the next three years with a cut of $20
billion in the coming year. The time has c.ome
to discard the notion that Russia is about to roll
across Western Europe, or that a primitive China
barely able to feed itself is about to conquer the
world. I

Minority Education Programs Examined

by POHLA SMITH
Staff Writer

Dr. James J. Holloway, acting
chief of the Equality in Education

Commission of the U.S. Office of

Education, Department of Health,

Education, and Welfare, evaluated
the University’s programs inthe
-field of minority education at an

informal faculty luncheon last

Thursday.

The luncheon was sponsored by
the Urban Education Commit-
tee and” University Community
Program (UCEP). As chief of the
commission, Dr. Holloway trav-
els to universities in order to eval-
uate programs, and make sugges-
tions as to improvements.

The luncheon program was in-
troduced by Dr. Norman R. Dick-
son, co-chairman of the Urban Ed-

Mari Anne Sings Tues. and Sat.

Jack Freeman. assistant chancel-
lor, who gave a statement in place
of Chancellor Posvar. who was out
of town, on attitudes with respect
to urban minority education. Free-
man said that the University had
a strong commitment in this field
of meeting obligations by virtue
of its position in the community.
Through ne said this is a relative-
ly new commitment, Freeman ex-
pressed hope that the University
would promote programs in the
interest of the community and that
the only constraints would be the

..necessary funds. He finished his

statement by saying that the com-
mitment includes the Chancellor.

Next, faculty members from
the four departments in urban-
minority education programs gave
a run—down on their own depart-
ments. Dr. Welsh White of the
Law School explained the pro-
gram, initiated in November,
1968. by which they hope to at-
tract more black law students. In
the "Four Year Program.“ black
students who appear to have the
needed potential, but lack re-
quired grades. etc. are admitted
to the law department. “They are
then given." he explained, “four
years to complete three years of
work.

the University blacks who have
had deficient high school prepara-

Another program, which Barnes
explained was the New Careers,

Dr. Omar K. Moore of the Clar-

stated were trying to prepare un- .

D.r Holloway began his critique
by saying that to make good eval-

Underground
Theatre

. by JUDY VOLLMER

Under the direction of Bert
Nemitz, Sandy Berman perform-
ed in Samuel Beckett’s Act With-
out Words; a Mime for One Play-
er last Friday and Saturday eve-
nings in the University,Theatre.

Miss Berman portrayed a mid-
dle aged man thrust into a strange
environment without the aid of
another human. He struggles with
mechanisms and frustrations
within his environment, and, when
he finds himself‘ unable to con-
quer them, he tries to take his life.
He fails at this too, however, and
instead of turning to desperation,
he becomes apathetic and does
nothing. . 7

Miss Berman’s interpretation
was well-polished and precisely
delivered. As a mime, she exe-
cuted each fall, and each grasp
with the sense of futility and help-
lessness that Act Without Words
expresses.

The Latin American Theatre at
the University presented Stories
to be Told, an Argentine play by
Osvaldo Dragun. The play pre-
ceded Act Without Words. Guiller-
mo Borrero directed Thomas
Markham, Linda Loxterman, Don-
ald Young and Marilyn Plotkins in
three short episodes of human
caricatures. According to the au-
thor, “We propose to punch these
people in the stomach, because
that is the place where it hurts

them most.” Mr. Borrero, the di-
rector, stated, “The ‘satisfied
man’ could very easily lose his
emotional stability —— achieved by
not thinking — if he decided to re-
flect about his surroundings.”

The cast of four actors present-
ed three stories, but the last one
was the most unique. The Story of
the Man Who Turned into a Dog,

although it concerned a tragic end
for a human, was strangely funny,
especially every time Thomas
Markham barked,

Specifically Dr. Holloway said
that he was impressed by the spir-
it with which Pitt is approaching

its social problems.

Assessing each department, he
stated that too little is being done
about the shortage of well-trained
black lawyers, and was greatly
impressed with the programs of
UCEP.

He also said that he found the
work of Professor Moore’s depar-
ment very interesting. He went on
to say, “Reading is one of the big
blocks that prevent minorities
from enjoying the fruits of demo-
cracy” and “the right to read
ought to be the right of every
American youth.”

In concluding his evaluation, he
expressed hope that just as some
universities attain the rank of
number one in sports, that Pitt

f might become number one in race

relations. He encouraged the Uni-
versity to continue its work by
quoting St. Paul: “Be not weary
of well-doing.” .

Dr. Dickson concluded the pro-
gram in speaking of the effort re-
quired to make progress by quot-
ing Alice in Wonderland: “Gee,

My Hunter, a singer with a
lot of soul, is the talented enter-

tainer who is currently appearing -.\

at the Pit Coffee House.

Amidst the friendly atmosphere
of the Student Union’s carpeted
Supper Room, the crowd of stu-
dents sat intrigued by both Miss

' Hunter’s voice and beauty. The

presence of candle-lit tables and
checked table cloths provided the
ideal background for her perform-
ance. ,

As Miss Hunter sang, one did
not observe merelv a singer in the
traditional sense, but, instead, an
accomplished actress in the true
sense of the word. Into each num-
ber, she poured her heart and soul
and in turn was greatly appreci-

‘ated by both black and white stu-

dents. She was able to succesful-
ly combine her facial expressions
and rhythmic movement with her
voice.

 Innovative Astronomy 12

 

A “new look” in Astronomy 12
this term is getting mixed reac-
tions from the department facul-
g ty. Initiated by graduate student

Bob Nelson, the innovative course
 ‘ structure deals with “intelligent

3 I life in the universe” in contrast
 . to past’ emphasis on stellar as-

titonomy.

 

According to Nelson. the new
emphasis stems from his belief
that “a heavy dose of phsycis in
beginning astronomy is not the
way to teach and to keep the inter-
est of undergraduates.”

More than 200 students have en-

rolled in Astronomy 12 and the as-
signed text dealing with the ques-

tion of interrestial life is the fruit
of Western and Eastern efforts in
the field.

One book, Intelligent Life in the
Universe. by Russian Schklovskii
and American Carl Sogen, goes
beyond the aspect of the possibil-
ity of life into the question of con-
tact and cooperation with life
from other planets.

Nelson‘s approach has drawn
criticism from the senior faculty
in his department who question

Faculty Gives Mixed Reactions

Dr. Nicholas Wagman. chair-
man of the department and direc-
tor of the Allegheny Observatory,
liked the course as “it was in the
past.” "Astronomy is one thing
and speculation is another.“ he
said. “While I believe that the
question is of some importance.
it is an area for Biology rather
than Astronomy.”

The “controversial text” and
“the philosophical approach” has

Cagers Battle Westmini
Ridl Faces Alma Mater Tonight
As Panthers Eye Sixth Victory

by ED CONLEY
Associate Sports Editor

About two weeks ago Harold
Davis announced his resigna-
tion as head basketball mentor
at Westminster, becoming the
third head hoop coach to leave the
Titans in less than three years.
The resignation becomes effective
at the end of the season.

Tonight. Davis brings the Ti-
tans to the Field House to face the

Former Coach of . . .

Game?
By Martha Hartle

 Sports Editor
lllllllllllIlllllllIllIllllIIIIIIllIIIIIIlllllllllIIIllIIllllIIIIIllIIIIIllllllllllllIlllllllIIIllllllllllIllllllllllllllllllllllllllll

Ever since the NCAA announced the new ruling which
permits an 11 game grid schedule, there’s been specula-
tion and rumor about the Panthers picking up another op-
ponent for next fall.

In Monday morning’s Pittsburgh Post Gazette, sports
editor Al Abrams hinted that the Panthers’ new foe would
be the University of Washington and the game would sup-
posedly be played on the West Coast. But according to
Athletic Director Casimir Myslinski, the report given by
Abrams is completely wrong.

“He was just guessing,” explained Myslinski. “We are
looking for an 11th game, but we have nothing definite with
the University of Washington. ” 1

Myslinski also explained that an 11th game, if sched-
uled, could be added either at the beginning or end of the
current season, but it will depend “on the types of teams
we can play.” “The ruling came so fast,” continued the AD,
“that teams just aren’t rushing into anything right away.”

The NCAA passed the 11th game rule at its conven-
tion Jan. 11-14 and it came as no surprise to Myslinski.
“We knew it would be considered, but you never know if
it’ll pass or not.”

Myslinski is in favor of an 11th game and he feels that
the players, coaches and fans are in favor as well. “It will
help us make more money to combat the costs of athle-
tics,” he continued, “but we’re trying to evaluate all the
factors, such as how it will affect the individual players,
coaches and students. I personally don’t think it would hurt
anything. ‘ '

Also making football news this week, head coach Carl
DePasqua announced his first recruit for next fall's fresh-
man team and he’s a blue chip prospect.

Clair Wilson, a 5’10” 175 pound halfback from Kiski
Area, chose Pitt after narrowing his list to include Michi-
gan and Indiana. Wilson is considered to be one of the top
prospects in the area as he was named the most valuable‘
player in WPIAL Class AA competition las season.

In addition, the Kiski Area star was a first—team all-
state selection and a Big 33 pick. He rushed for 1,491
yards in 238 carries and scored 16 touchdowns in 1969.

“He’s the type of player we’re looking for to compete
on a winning basis with our schedule,’_’ commented DePas-
qua. “We think he’s an excellent college prospect and he’ll
be a fine addition to our program.”

Buzz Ridl’s cagers move downtown two weeks from
tonight for a home contest with Temple in the Civic Arena.
The team and coaches hope a big crowd will be on hand.
Casimir Myslinski has indicated that the campus buses will
be available to transport students to and from the Arena.
A definite bus schedule for the Feb. 11 contest will be list-
ed in a future Pitt News‘.

Crowds in the Field House thus far have been very en-
couraging as the first five~ home basketball encounters
have all drawn over 1,000 fans. Compare this to last season
when the home attendance soared over the 1,000

the New Wilmington school. Buzz

Ridl. Tip-off is scheduled for 8:15
p.m.

Ron Galbreath replaced Ridl
last season when the current Pan-
ther coach decided to give major
competition a try after years of
successful tutorship in the small
college ranks. Galbreath had

some success at Westminster as

the Titans compiled another win-
ning record. including two vic-
tories over the Jungle Cats.

Galbreath surprised most West-
minster people by switching to his
alma mater, Slippery Rock, and
Davis, a former Titan star, be-
came the district’s first Black
head coach.

Davis is more than "the first
Black man to do something" to
Ridl. The cager coach was an as-
sistant when Davis first played

for the Titan roundball squad and

became head coach in Davis‘ jun-
ior year.

“They’re not playing exactly
the same type of game as last
year,” Ridl said. “They use some
of the things they used last year.
but not 100 per cent. A new coach
brings his own ideas."

The Titans are 7-6 at the
moment and have been struggling
to stay above the ;500 mark
throughout the season. But Ridl
isn't worried about his old school
coming up with a bad season.

“Last year they had lost about
five games at this time," he said.
Then they came onto win 13 of
their last 14 games.” ~

This season the Titans have
been hampered by lack of experi-
ence. the same nemesis that rou-
bled Ridl while the Cats were on
the road.

Co-captain Bill Samuels of Far-
rell is the only returning letter-
man from the team that upended
the Panthers twice last winter.
The 6’ guard is the quintet’s lead-
ing scorer, but has been benched
in favor of Tim Gribbin, a75’l0”
sophomore.

The other co-captain. Ted Schu-
maker. was the leading rebounder
before he was replaced in the line-
up by a 6’6" freshman center.
Fred Rothen. Rothen. of course.
will not be permitted to play
against the Jungle Cat varsity and
Schumaker. who is also 6'6“,
will start.

Gary Brown. a junior. is the
other first-string guard. and jun-
iors Randy Huey and Scott Green-
wood are the starting forwards.

The cagers’ inexperience has-
n’t been bothering them lately.
They have played five straight
home games and have won all but
the thrilling encounter with West
Virginia. The Mountaineers won
that game by one point.

“Playing at home has helped us

certainly.” Ridl said. “But, ‘along.

with that, we've executed better-
offensively and defensively." P

The Cats haven’t been putting I

Matmen’s Early Lead  

  Stops Clairon State 

by MARTHA HARTLE
Sports Editor

After the grapplers had
beaten Clarion 22-12 last night
to pick up victory number sev-
en on the season. coach Dave
Adams" paid his opponent quite a
complement.

"I'd have to say that Clarion is
the best team. other than .\'avy.
that we‘ve met all season." said
the victorious Adams. "They were
very strong. especially‘ in the
heavier weight classes and the
fans saw some excellent wrest-
ling tonight. "

"Our kids carried the fight to
them and I'm just tickled to death
about the way were wrestling."

The grapplers won six of the ten
individual matches, while two end-
ed in draws.-The matmen carried
a 20-2 lead into the final three
bouts.

Freshmen Steve Weiss. Randy
Payne and Scott Ross continued

* their winning ways in the light

weight matches.

Ross ran his undefeated mark
to 7-0 in an exciting bout which
saw Ross come from behind scor-
ing a reversal in the final 35 sec-
onds to edge Clarions Garry Bar-
t0n.4-3.

Randy Payne remained unde-
feated at 126 as he decisioned
Dale Murdock, 13-5, while Steve
Weiss upped his record to 4-1 with
a 7-1 win over previously unde-
feated Ross Donahue. Murdock
had been 7-1-1 going into last
night’s match.

Coming off an injury. Pat Lay-
ery got back into action with a 6-1
decision over Larry Wiser at 150
while Buddy Morris edged Les
Bressler 6-5 at 158. Morris‘ win
was especially satisfying consi-

dering that Bressler had beaten .
-Morris 8-1 last year. L‘ L 

Morris took an early 3-1 lead in
the bout and held the lead at 5-2
into the final period. Bressler
came back with a reversal and

also picked up a point for stalling. '

but Morris escaped and held on
for the 6-5 win.

Bobby Kuhn upped his season
record to 7-1 with a 6-2 decision
over previously unbeaten Santo
Ricotta. Kuhn scored on two re-
versals and gained two points for
riding time, while Ricotta picked
up his points on a reversal.

Mark Payne and Don Kinsely
battled to a 1-1 draw in the 142
match. with both wrestlers scor-
ing on escapes. Dave Young also
had to settle for a draw. but the
sophomore heavyweight missed a
decision by only one second on the
riding time clock.

Young took a 2-0 lead on a take-
down in the first period. but Clar-

. ion's Gary Holsopple ‘knotted the
score with two escapes. Young v
took the lead in the third period. A
"with an escape. but Holsopple

came right back with a takedown

in the final 40 seconds of the bout._

Young picked up one point for rid-

ing time. as he missed the two . l ‘

minute mark by. one second.

‘Willie Saloky held a 6-2 lead in
the final period of his 177 pound

bout with former state champ 1
" Henry Shaffer. but Saloky got,

caught in a bad position and was

-pinned. Paul Allen lost a 6-3 de-

cision to Jack Riegel at 190. Rieg-

el went into the match with a per- '

fect 9-0 slate.

l The matmen now take a 7-1 rec-
ord into Saturday nights home
meet with perenniel power Le-
high. Clarion is now 8-2. ‘

JUNIOR BOB KUHN upped his season record to 7-1 last night with a 6-2
win over Clarion’s previously unbeaten Santo Riccotfa. The matmen cle-
feated Clarion, 22-12, and will host Lehigh Saturday night.

  Cubs F ace “Little T

by BILL NAAB

When the Cub hoopsters rocked the Point Park frosh, 91-
70, Monday evening, the athletic department may have discov-

ered a crystal ball gazer within their midst.
 A 12-point Cub lead dropped to just a four point advantage,
34-30, at halftime. The Cubs had been utilizing the fastbreak
against the smaller opponents, and as the first half was coming

to a close many of the Cub passes

. found either the track that encir-

cles the Field House hardwood or
otherwise lodged into the hands
of the downtown rivals.

Fran Webster (Panther assis-
tant coach), meanwhile, sat snug-
ly in a seat two rows behind the
Point Park bench.

After observing the growls and
cries of the Cub first half, he re-
marked, “They’re running with
the little guys.” When asked
whether the smaller size of the
Pioneers was the determining
factor in the change of style, Web-
ster just smiled and said, “That’s
one reason why they shouldn't be

running. They’ll come along in the
second half, though; they’ll
(Cubs) runaway from them (Pio-
neers) . They’ll win by 20 points.

Webster couldn’t have been
more accurate in his prediction if
he had written the script for the
contest. After two minutes of the
second half passed, the Cubs were
were still engaged in a tight bat-
tle, 41-35.

Within three minutes, however,

the hoopsters zipped their lead up
to 52-35. They slowed their offense

down, looked for the open man,
and expertly moved the ball"

through the Little Pioneer de-

fense and in close to the bucket. '

“They did a good job of moving
the ball around and in close to the
hoop. It's the first time that
they've really worked at this.
Sometimes we get lackadaisical
and careless, though,” stated Cub
coach Tim Grgurich.

He additionally explained his
first half strategy, the memory
of which didn’t exactly encourage
a broad smile. Grgurich mention-
ed that his club attempted to
“blow them out of the game.”

“We wanted the game over with
early. We just missed a lot of
passes. If we feel we’re stronger

If you don’t like the way people talk to each other,  

we’ll pay you to change it.

We're in the communications business. _

And during the next 30 years we're going to upgrade all the equip-
ment wé now have in order to provide even better service to our 6 million
existing customers. .

As if that weren't enough we're also going to have to come up with
enough new equipment to provide telephone service to about 26 million
more people. As well as equipment for a much more extensive data com-
munications program.

We need enough people (electrical, civil, mechanical and industrial 1

engineers, designers, accountants and economists) to plan, design, build
and operate a company that will be four times bigger than we are today.
We also need engineers, researchers and scientists to develop electronic
switching equipment, laser and other communications systems we'll be
using 10, 25 and 50 years from now.

But this is only one part of our communications business.

Our Sylvania people, for example, are involved in other types of
communications. Like color television sets, satellite tracking stations
and educational television systems. ,

Automatic Electric, Lenkurt, Ultronic Systems and some of our other
companies, subsidiaries and divisions are working on advanced types of
integrated circuitry, electro—opticals and communications systems be-
tween people and computers and between computers and computers.

80 if you think you have something to say about the way people talk
to each other. . .we’re ready to listen.

than the opposition, we’ll run."

Point Park definitely was no
match for the Cubs, at least where
height was concerned. Not one of
the Pioneer players stretched
above six feet.

The two tallest Cubs, in the
meantime, had a feast. Carl Mor-
ris, 6’6”, and Bill Sulkowski,
6’8”, crushed the Lilliputian op-
ponents by rolling-up a combined
total of 63 points. Morris connect-
ed on 17 field goals and three of
three free throws for 27 points;
Sulkowski accounted for a 26 point
total.

At one point in the later part of
the first half when the Pioneers
stole the game’s momentum, Carl
Morris-spearheaded the Cub at-
tack enough to offset the onrush-
ing Pioneers.

Morris’ four straight field goals
increased the Cub lead from 22-
16 to 30-22 during a six min-
ute stretch. Once Morris cooled-
off in the first half’s final two and
one-half minutes, the Pioneers
sliced four points off the Cubs ad-
vantage.

Tonight, Morris and Sulkowski
will lead the club in an effort to
cut the winning Westminster Ti-
tans into helpless midgets, and
any optimistic predictions from
coach Webster are welcome.

FREE RIDE

The free campus bus will be
running tonight for both the
freshman and ‘varsity games.’
The bus will begin at 6 p.m. and
continue running until 8 :15 with
stops at the Towers, Student
Union, Bigelow Blvd. and Sta-
dium Drive in ten minute inter-
vals. Following the game, the
bus will transport fans down
Cardiac Hill.

The cagers will be going for
their sixth win tonight as they
host the Titans of Westminster.

On First Day

  

None of the Panther seniors
were selected in the first day
of the combined professional
football draft yesterday.

- The pros went through nine
rounds. leaving eight for today's
session and chances of many Jun-
gle Cats being chosen are slim.

  

  
  
   
 

West Virginia was shut-out yes-
terday also. with Carl Crennel‘s
absence among the group being
the biggest surprise.

The top team in the area, Penn
State, certainly wasn’t blanked.
Six Nittany Lions went to AFL or
NFL clubs in the first seven
rounds.

Cats Miss Draft

Mike Reid. the piano playing
tackle. was the only Lion to be
claimed in the first round. The
Cincinnati Bengals snatched the
All-American.

Another Lion who was expect-
ed to go in the opening go-around.
Charlie Pittman. was bypassed for
awhile. reportedly because of an
ankle injury. The St. Louis Cards
finally picked him in the third
round.

The other Lions selected in the
draft were Dennis Onkotz. Steve
Smear. Neal Smith. and John‘ Eb-
ersole.

Litchfield Manor W/ins

  Again as Dorm Action

Moves Into

by MARTIN HELLMAN

The intramural basketball
5 season is barely into its sec-
ond week, but one team has al-
ready shown itself to be ex-
ceptionally strong. Litchfield
-. Manor followed last week’s crush-
ing of the House of Lords by de-
molishing the Den of Iniquity, 100-
32. All nine of their players scored,
with five of them hitting for dou-
ble figures. George Medich and
Jeff Barr led the victors with 25
and 20, respectively.

. In other dorm games, Keystone
downed the Playboys, 58-52, be-
fore losing to Random House, 60-.
49, with Ray Barnhart netting 31
points for Random. Earlier in the
week, Random beat Hawthorne
House, 47-34.

Pleasure Palace remained un-
defeated by capturing two easy
wins via forfeit by Stratford and
Hawthorne. 7

33

The Playboys rebounded from
the Keystone loss to nip Stratford
House, 47-44. John Berry, had 18

2nd Week

for the Playboys, while Bob Mad-
tes got 20 points in a losing cause.

Mad House upened the Rising
Sun, 61-40, and edged the Lords,
‘61-52. Skip Treece sparkled in
both games for Mad with a com-
bined total of 60 points,

The Rising Sun fell victim to a
strong Sutherland squad, 74-39,
with five Sutherland men popping
for twin figures. The Lords had a
similar balanced attack in whip-
ping the Panthers, 71-19. The
Panthers won by forfeiture over
Den of Iniquity.

The Engineers began action
‘with three low scoring contests.
The Petrols beat the Chemies, 42- '
17, while the Electrics downed
the Mets, 39-32. Also the Mechs
won over the Frosh, 46-37.

Only one of the three Indepen- I

dent Leagues started play. Led by
Ron McCle1lan’s 28 points, the
DE’s sunk the Pestles, 72-40.
The Fiddlers No. 2 nipped the Glee
Club, 46-43, in a tight battle. The
Hawks won by forfeiture of the

AND WE KNOW THE DIFFERENCE

Differences in quality make one stone worth’
more than another. Delicate gradations of color,
almost invisible imperfections sometimes
present, accuracy of cut are of utmost importance
in the value of a diamond. You can depend
on us to explain these differences to you when you
choose your diamond.

(‘Kent Scott received an

 award two weeks ago that sur-
 prised him. Not that the Pan-
 ther guard didn’t think he de-
 served the honor; he just sim-
 ply had never heard of it be-
 fore. »

The Eastern Collegiate Athletic

: Conference named Scott as their
' Sophomore of the Week for the

Jan. 12-18 period. He scored 45
points in two games that week and
connected on 65.5 per cent of
his shots.

“That's quite an honor—in fact,
I had never heard of it,” hesaid.
“So I was quite proud.”

The former star at Raytown
High School in the Kansas City
suburb hasn’t been averaging 20
points or more all season long.
And when Buzz Ridl was shifting
his starting line-up around during
the Panther’s road woes Scott’s

status, like the other starters, .

didn’t ‘appear completely certain.

Before the surge that gained
him the unexpected recognition he
possessed an 11.7 point average,
which was third among cager
scorers. His shooting percentage
was the highest of the regulars,
but far below his present pace.

He currently leads the squad in
scoring with 177 points (14.75

per game) and was hitting the -.
_ nets at better than two-thirds ac-

curacy before he dipped a bit in‘
the cagers’ latest victory.

“I talked to the coach after a
few games when I didn’t play
well,” Scott said. “I had a cold
_for awhile—.I’m not making’ ex-
cuses—but I talked to him and he
told me my position wasn’t in jeo-
pardy. I felt I had the job.”

No one expects the sharpshoot-
er to pour in as many pointsas
someone like Pete Maravich be-
cause Ridl stresses a keen sense
of choosing the percentage shot.
This type of offense could bother
some marksmen, but Scott has a

valid reason for not being disturb-
ed by it.

"We were kind of deliberate in
high school," he noted. “We tried
to get the good shot. So, that's the
type of game I'm used to."

Scott’s highest production at
Raytown was 35 points, which

isn’t bad for a guard on a slow- ‘

moving team.

Scott can't forget about his de-
fensive play, especially with the
involved defense that the Jungle
Cats use.

“The defense is the biggest dif-‘
ference," he said. “Coach Grgur_-
ich uses the same offense with the
freshmen to get you ready for the
varsity. But, he keeps the man-to-
