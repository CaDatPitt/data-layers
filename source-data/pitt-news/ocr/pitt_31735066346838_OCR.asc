Neville Island, Studied

For Research Center

I Neville Island may be the site of a newresearch program
sponsored by the University, concerning water pollution and

atomic radiation.

The property is government land which has been used
by the Neville Township School Board. Under the terms of
its contract the board was to use the land for an athletic

field, a clinic, and a library. At
present the school uses the town-
ship athletic field, and the clinic
and library have been included
in a new wing added to the

t0 Shlp school.
 cently the Government no-

tified the school board that it
was taking the property back be-
cause the terms of the agreement
were not being followed. Since
then they have sent out notices
to health and education agencies,
asking if they would be inter-
ested in the land.

So far the University has been
the only institution to respond
to the offer. It is not certain that
the University will get the prop-
erty — the department of Health,
Education and Welfare has said
that the property will go to
whatever agency can make the
best use of it - it ‘seems to be
the only Institution interested.

Committee Works to Avoid Scheduling Conﬂicts

Events Calender Planned For Fall

By BARRY GROSS

Leaders of student organizations
are being asked to submit appli-
cations for major University ev-
ents they are planning to sponsor
to the Major Events Calendar
Committee.

According to Student Union di-i
rector Larry Heller, the Commit-
tee cannot approve or veto the
scheduling of an event, but‘ serves
merely as a service to assist
groups in avoiding conflicts which
would result if two major events
were scheduled for the same day.

University Departments and stu-
dent organizations were to have
ﬁlled out applications mailed to
them andsent them to
dent Union in time for a meeting
which was held May 3.

Limited Information

   

the Stu- *

However, information was re-
ceived only for the iMidday Se-
ries, Wiliam Pitt Debating Union,
and the Dean of Women’s Ofﬁce.

Heller has again sent out ap-
p l i c a. t i o n s and information
sheets describing the concept of
the Major Events Calendar.
Applications are due May 25,
with the Committee scheduled to
meet on the 31 of this month.

Any student organizations that
do not receive an application can
pick one up at the SU Desk.

The Committee has defined a
Major Event as:

Having all University signiﬁc-
ance, such as convocation, regis-
tration, or commencement.

Predicts Attendance

Having a predicted attendance

of 200 or more, such as the sched-

Fountain atiCathedral
Side Running Again

By SUE ECKMAN .1

The fountain on the side of the?

C‘athedral is working for the first
time since 1934.

Shortly after the big building

was built the water in the foun-

tain was turned on, but it was im-

it was found that the wind was
playing havoc with the water. At
that time the edge of the basin
was smooth. not notghed as it is
at present. and a thin him of wa-
ter ran from the basin to the
ground. '

A few years ago pi;,mt.i11g was
introduced around the fountain
and this year slots were cut in
the edge of the basin. They let
the water fall in wide st=‘eams,
toiling the wind and keeping walk
and passerby reasonably dry. A
closed system is used, the water
being recirculated by pumps in
the basement.

University Maintenance

The University does “the vast
majority of our own maintenance,”
including the fountain, according
to Bruce Allen, asistant superin-
tendent of buildings. It has its
own plumbers and electricians,
and maintains a staff of ove" 90
The janitorial staff
numbers 165, and there are 14
gardeners. A few phases of main-
tenance, such as the upkeep of the
elevators, are under outside con-
tract. ‘

One of the chief problems, ac-
cording to Allen, is trying to
keep the grounds looking nice in
spite of students’ feet. He said,
“We have a good bit of diﬁiculty
trying to maintain the grounds
and would appreciate it if the stu-
dents would use the walks, not
the lawn—-—particularly in muddy
seasons when they trample the
grass into the ground.”

Advisor Discusses
Radio Budget

Editor, The Pitt News: ‘

The Advisory Board of WPGH
has recommended total endorse-
ment of budget requests, space
needs and programming content
for the student broadcasting sta-
tion.

The Board has also recommend-

ed that an advisor be appointed I

to provide technical and profes-
background essential to
guide the station growth. Those in
the field of publications readily
‘seek advice from faculty mem-
bers in specialized fields as well
as from those foremen in plants
where magazines and newspapers
are printed.-

The Board has reques_ted that
either a part-time or full-time
professional advisor be appointed.

- The needs of the station as well

as budget provisions will deter-

‘ mine the extent to which an ad-

visor will participate.

The Board was positive in its
approval of the activity of the
radio station and in itsrequests
increased budgets. We are
hoping, along with the staff of
WPGH, that these recommenda-
tions can be approved to provide
a complete outlet for learning

On Track “Problem"

Editor, The Pitt News:

That was a good column on the
track “problem” at Pitt. 

Track ‘is an individual
and if they are complacent then
they’ll certainly be losers; and
losers don’t deserve scholarships

Land Of The Switz

 

 

"in 1948 was politically necessary

Today we embark on the second leg of the stay-
last week .we students who could not afford to
at—home‘s tour of Europe. As you may remember,
join the hoards of our fellows on their care—free
journeys abroad began an imagi-
nary Grand Tour of the Contin-
ent with a visit to France. Now
our luxury liner sweeps us to our
second stop, Switzerland.

Switzerland, or as it is other-
wise called, the Land of the 
Switz, is a small seacoast nation
completely surrounded by moun-
tains. In this picturesque setting,
the red-cheeked inhabitants joy-
fully’ spend their days wearing
funny Bermuda shorts ‘with A
straps, /chasing wooden cuckoo birds for their clock
factories and posing for Ovaltine commercials.

These loveable natives, who, in their own lan-
guage , call themselves Schweitzerlunderlfolkserls,
live mainly in their exquisite picture-postcard cities
nestled in the mountains. These picture—postcard
towns are so beloved throughout the world that
the Shah of « Iran once attempted to purchase
Lucerne in 1938 for his wife, the Shawnee of Iran.
The people of Switzerland were so overwhelmed
with his appreciation of the beauty of Lucerne

that they promptly mailed it to him, free of charge. A

Another city which must be on our itinerary is
Zurich. I
Toured Zurich .

Nowthat we have toured Zurich, we shall now
turn our attention to the most famous of all Switz
cities, Geneva. This metropolis is ‘constantly in
the news as it has been the meeting ground for
disarmament talks between the major powers of the
world for the past several years. It is because of
these negotiators that the natives of Switzerland
have become prosperous by waxing their skis,
serving their champagne and ‘selling them t_heir ex-

‘ cellentwristwatches whichare necessary for timing
i the deaths of the nations’ various nuclear weapons

moratoriums.
The chief industry of Geneva is, of course,

s.Mmcs*~ss¢«l.l.-, - .. —  .

This evening in" New York, Harry Truman will
deliver the principal address at the 14th Israel In-
dependence Day Celebration. It is highly appro-
priate that Mr. Truman should be called upon to
do this, for his granting of '
American recognition of Israel

    
     

for its future existence.”

Now, 14 years after Israel’s
birth, it also seems appropriate
to briefly list some of the suc-
cesses and failures of the Jewish
State, and to outline its» present
position in the Middle‘ East.

Its first success is its very
creation, and the fact that it has
continued to exist.‘ That was, in

_ itself, a rather difficult accomplishment, consider-

ing that Israel is surrounded by a group of Arab
states who are not merely unfriendly, but openly

advocate Israel’s destruction. Due“, to a favorable

public opinion in the Western world, brought about
largely by the unceasing efforts’ of the Jewish

minorities to present Israel in a favorable,‘ light,-

the Arabs have not been able to accomplish this
objective.

Israel’s second major success is, directly re-'

lated to the first, and that is the military superior-
ity it hassbeen able to retain over the Arab states.
The two major examples of this occurred in ‘1948
(The War for Independence) and in 1956 (The
Sinai war).

Almost Tofol . _ .
Although the results of both wars showed almost
total victory for Israel, the circumstances of fight-.

‘ing were somewhat different. I_n,1948, Israel, in,

large measure, fought a defensive campaign forced
upon it by Arab invasion. The ingredients of suc-
cess were a smattering of illegal arms and _a
large measure of courage displayed by residents and
recent refugees of Hitler’s Third Reich.

If courage was not lacking in 1956 as Israel in- _
vaded the Sinai Peninsula, then the unprofessional,

character was. For instead of theprovisional char-

, actor of the 1948 Army,’ the Arabsfaced a highly.

try are democratically stacked next to earnings of
American movie stars on every street corner as a

part of the “Help Keep Switzerland Green” cam... 

paign. Climbing to thetop of one of these ‘stacks

is loads of fun, for upon reaching the top, the view”

of the Alps is magniﬁcent. ‘»
The Alps are the famed mountains of iSwitzer..~

land, so named after the desperate cries of strand- .

ed British mountain climbers. Most prominent of
the Alps is the Matterhorn, so named after the most-

prominent of the Alps, the Matterhorn. It is this‘

beautiful peak that has created the rise of little ~ »

Switzerland’s second largest industry, crutches.
Because of its banking and crutching industries,

Switzerland is quite self—suﬂ‘icie'nt and, therefore, ,-
has chosen to remain a neutral nation. This is also’

illustrated in the respect that since it is surrounded
by Germany, France, Italy and Austria, Switzer-
land’s native tongue is called Schweitzerdeutschen-
frankenaustritalian, which is about as neutral as
one can get. '
Holey Cheese

Switzerland’s contributions ‘to the world are
numerous. First, of course, is its famous holed
cheese, the name of which is a household word in
America:" Roquefort. This country’s second great
gift to the world is yodeling; that rare, poetic form
of Verbalized music. A sample, of course: A

Washington & Jefferson has a

Outfielder Ken Mason also adds
zing to the offense with a .321 bat.-

Coach Dave Scarborough

takes a rather dim View of his
tcam’s chances. “We’ll show up,”
wasthe only prediction he cared
to make concerning the outcome
of the game. “Our team has gone
a lot further than we expected,"
the mentor added. “We have
quite a few freshmen in the
lineup and we're pleased that
we’ve done as well as we have

West Virginia should provide a

The Mountaineers will be out to

Coach Steve Herrick.

Shafer boasts a 6-0 record
and an earned run average of
0.90. In 50 innings of pitching
he has struck out 54 and walked
only 11. Shafer’s abilities are not
contained to the mound alone.
He is hitting a robust .381.

Joining Shafer as the Mounties’
leading hitters are second baseman
Joe Hatalla hitting at .455 and
outﬁielders Jim Procopio and
Craig Mankin and shortstop Tom
Stepp, all of whom are batting
over .340.

Silent Bats
Most of the Mounties’ bats fell
silent before the pitching of John
Carlisle last week and the Pan-
ther’s southpaw ace will be out
to do the same on Saturday.

If Carlisle or Jim Sylvis, who
is pitching against W & J, need
any help, veteran Ralph Shut-
terly will be back in the bull-
pen after missing the past few
games due to knee trouble.
Shutterly and Harry Kane give
the Panthers a top-notch corps
of relievers.

lineup he has been using. lately.

Thin-Clads Face Penn State

Seek Initial Win,

In Dual E ncounter

By LEN BEEENFIELD
The Panther track team will be
-out to prove the lion is not the
king of the jungle when they
travel to University Park on Sat-

urday to engage the 1 ions of Penn

State. In this case the “jungle”
involved is a quarter mile cinder
track.

When the Panthers and the
Lions clash, past records and per-
formances can be disregarded, and
this year should prove to be no
exception. The Panthers will have
an added incentive to bring home
a victory on Saturday as they
have yet to win in dual meet com-
petition.

The Jungle Cats sampled the
taste of victory when they placed
second in a triangular meet ‘a
West Virginia lastlweek, and with
the sweet ﬂavor still lingering on
their palates, they are hopeful of
killingvthe lion in his own den.

Good Performance

Although -Penn State defeated.

the Panthers last season by an
84%-46%/3 score, Coach Rees’
charges were in their battling all
the way, and turned in one of

CRAM COURSE "N0. 4: BATHYMETRY

Continuing our series of prc-ﬁnal exam cram courses, t(.»d:n.y we

I «take up ba.thymetry——the study of ocean depths.

Admittedly, this is not a terribly popular course onlmost
campuses.‘And sma.ll‘wonder. In the whole world there is only
one bathyscape, andcnly two people canget into it;

Nevertheless, the ‘study of ocean depths is of great impor-
tance.-Why,'do you realize that the ocean is by far the'worlct's
largest biological environment? The ocean has more than three
hundred times as much living room as all the continents-and
islands combined! Unfortunately, only ﬁshes live in it.

And s._ma,Il wonder. Who’d want to live some place where he
couldn’t smoke? Surely not I! I wouldn’t ‘give up my good
Marlboro Cigarettes for the Atlantic and the Paciﬁc put to-
gether. Nothing could induce me to forego Ma.rlboro’s ﬁne
mellow ﬂavor, Marlboro’s clean-white ﬁlter, Marlboro’s ﬂip—top
box that really ﬂips, Marlboro’s soft pack‘ that’s really soft.
Let others repair to the spacious deeps. Me, I will stick with
my Marlboros and the tiny garret I share “with a‘ tym-panist.

But I digress. Back to theoceans. The-'la,rgest,-as we know,
is the Paciﬁc, which. was discovered by Balboa,-ia. Sps,n.ia.r'd~ of
great vision. To give you an idea of Balboa.’s vision, he ﬁrst
saw the Pacific while standing on 9. peak in Darien, -which is
in Connecticut-._

Even more astounding, when Balboa reache<fSan Frmcism,
he clearly saw the Hawaiian Islands! Being, as we know, a.
friendly cuss, Balboa waved merrily to the Hawaiians and
shouted, “Great little ocean yougot here, kids l” The Hawaiians,
also, as we know, friendly cusses, waved back, dc'cla.reda half
holiday, organized a luau, built a cheery ﬁre over, which. they
prepared several gallons of poi, a suckling pig, and Captain
Cook. This, of course, was the origin of Cooking.

  

S titular in /am 2%,?

But I digress. Tlie Paciﬁc, I say, is the largest ocean and also
tl re. deepest. The Mindanao Trench, off the Philippines, measures
moretlian 5,000 fathoms in depth. (It should. be pointed out
here that ocean depths are measured in fathorns-lengths of
six fect--- after Sir Walter Fathom, a noted British sea measure)‘
of the seventeenth century who, upon his twenty-ﬁrst birthday,
was given a. string six feet long with which he used to ‘go’
scampering all over England measuring seawater until he was
arrested for loitering. A passion for ‘measuring seems to have

‘run in the family; Fathom’s cousin, Sir Sol Furlong, spent all

his waking hours measuring race tracks until Charles II had
him beheaded in honor of the opening of the London School. of
Economics.)

- But I digress. Let us, as the poet Maseﬁcld said, go down to
the seas again. (The seas, incidentally, have ever been a favorite

"subject for poets and composers.) Who does not remember

Tennyson’s “Break, break, break”? Or Byron’s ‘‘Roll on, thou
dark and deep blue ocean, roll”? Or the many hearty sea chanties
that have enriched our folk music-songs like “Sailing Through
Kansas” and “I’ll Swab Your Deck If You'll Swab Mine” and
.‘‘The Artiﬁcial Respiration Polka.” -My own favorite sea chanty
goes like this:
A girl loved a sailor and he did jilt Mr,
And she did weep and roar—ho:'
Ifvntvil she found a perfect ﬁlter,
.4 mi o perfect smoke--Marlboro.’
Sing hey, sing ho, sing ring-a—dz'ng-ding,
Sing tors and spars and’ patches,
Sing pads and box and lots to like,
And don’t forget tlw. matches!

many   a knight

was splntf»  

 

In days of yore. men feared not only their
mortal enemies, but the elements too. it was
the medieval armorerfs task to protect his,
chief against foemen, But weather-protection
was a more difficult matter. Thus many aw
knight was spent in rusty armor. 1

Engineers and scientists at "Ford Motor
Company, engaged in both pure and applied
research, are Coping even today with the
problem of body protection (car bodies. that
is). Through greater understanding of.the'
chemistry of surfaces, they have developed,
new paint primers and undeprcoatings, new’
rustprooﬁng methods, and special sealers

that guard entire car bodies against nature's- l A

corrosive forces-all of which add armonlike.‘
protection to Ford-built cars.

From other scientiﬁc inquiries will undoubt-‘M

edly come new materials with protective

properties vastly superior to those of todayf;
This is another example of Ford's leadership:
through scientiﬁc research and engineering.‘
