Registrar Quick Announces Plans
For Second Semester Registration  
Scheduled To Take Place January 3-17

Students Asked To
Complete Survey
Of New Courses

Second Semester registration will

be conducted during the period Janu-
ary 3-17, 1934, for all students in the
College, Schools of Engineering,
Mines, Business Administration, Edu-
cation, and the Graduate School,
’ During the Christmas recess per-
mits to register will be mailed to all
concerned, assigning to each student
a deﬁnite time to report at the Office
of the Registrar for his study list and
Second Semester schedule of classes.
Students in the Graduate School will
report to the ofﬁce of the dean.
Study lists will be distributed accord-
ing to the following schedule:

Co1lege—-Wednesday, January 3.

Engineering, Mines, and Business
Administration—Thursday, January 4,

Education--Friday, January 5.

Graduate — Wednesday-Saturday,
January 3-6.

Students who continue in the same
courses in which they are ‘enrolled
during the present semester will have
the privilege of completing their Sec-
ond Semester registration by simply
ﬁlling in the necessary enrollment
forms. No conferences with advisers
or deans will be required. The avail-
ability of the class cards for such
students will be assured, provided
they register early during the regis-
tration period.

If it is necessary to make any
change in schedule, the ollices of the
deans and departments will maintain
an advisory service during the regis-
tration period, so that approval. for
altering programs of study may be
obtained without delay. When this
has been done, the student may pro-
ceed to complete his registration in
the regular manner.

It should be remembered that all of
the steps in the enrollment procedure
-—including the assessment» and pay-
ment of tuition—wi1l be provided in
the advance registration set-up. Stu-
dents who complete all of these de-
tails during this period will have the
privilege of a vacation from the close
of their last First Semester examina-
tion to the opening of the Second
Semester, Wednesday, February 7,

The popularity bf this new plan of
advanced registration is proven by
the fact that last year 3,355 classiﬁed
students took advantage of it. It is
anticipated that over 4,000 will regis-
ter early this year,

Entering into the circle of amateur
theatricals with strides, four student
directors will present the results of
their work in the play production
class of Carl B. Cass, directorﬁof Pitt

stage of the Fanny Edel Falk Ele-
mentary school. This presentation is
the ﬁrst in a series of 12 student-di-
rected plays.

Virginia Hutchins, C34; Ruth Feick,
Ed35; Louis Reizenstein, C35; and
Ruth Drum, C34, will make their de-
buts as directors this evening in a

program including the four skits:
“Evening Dress Indispensable,” “A
Cup of Tea,” “Two Crooks and

Lady,” and “Clipped.”

Tomorrow night the plots of three
of the four plays in the second group
of student plays are ce-ntered on do-
mestic triangle situations. “Winners
All,” a farce dealing with the trials
and trbulations of two continually
quarreling married couples, has a cast
of four: Rose Silverman, Ed35; Esther

and Morton Harris, C36; with Mildred
Winner, Ed35, directing.

“Demitasse,” a dramatic comedy by
Robert McLaughin, presents a new
angle on the eternal triangle plot with
a cast of Francis Devlin, C37; Doro-
thy Grote, C34; Dent Strock, C35;
and Lillian Hahn, C35, directed by
Virginia Sepp, C35; while the Elmer
L. Rice comedy, “The Passing of
Chow-Chow,” shows the domestic wor-
ries of an artist, his young wife, and
a skye-terrier. Barbara Mateer, Ed35,
Joseph Sampson, Ed35;
Helen Rose Gibson, C36; and John
Hesselbein, C35, in this play.

A mythical European kingdom’
forms the background for the fourth
of tomorrow’s plays, a brief dramatic
sketch by Esse Dane, “When the
Whirlwind Blows.” The cast includes
Dolores O’Malley, Ed34; Louise Mc-
Kirdy, C36; and Gracia Faust, C35;
and is under the direction of Rose
Ball, C34.

Thursday evening’s program is the
work of Dorothy Lewis, Ed34; Ed-
ward Meyerson, C34; Josephine Pol-
lock, C35; and Harriet Sloan, Ed34.
They will direct the plays: “Wurzel-
Flummery,” “A Good Woman,” “The
First Dress Suit,” and “The Robbery,”
respectively.

“Wurzel £Flummery,” a play by A.. A.
Milne, is the story of two opposing

bequeathed ﬁfty thousand pounds by
the same man, each on the condition
that he take the name of lVurzel-K
Flummery. Jack VVyeth, C35; Hazel
Culbertson, Ed36; Clara Ertman, C35;

act in the farce by Arnold Bennett,
.“A Good VVoman.” The action of the
,play revolves around a nineteenth
century woman, who, on the day of
her marriage, is confronted by the
appearance of a long-forgotten lover.

A typical Bo-oth Tarkington ado-
lescent hero and his pride in his
dress suit forms the interest in “His
First Dress Suit,” with a cast of Nel-
son Mills, C35; Frances Goodwin,
C36; Bernice Houze, C36; and George,
Cook, C36.

“The Robbery” will present Helen

Alvin Foraker, C37; Alfred Berke-
witz, BA37; and Bernard Fleming.
C35, in a comedy of stolen silverware
and complicated romantic situations.

Miller submitted the following
statement to the News: “Naturally
everyone in the junior class cannot
be on the committee. However, the
committee is representative of the

class and the various schools of the
University, there being at least one
person from each school. It is the
duty of each member of the com-
mittee to present the dance to his or
her fellow classmates in such a way
that they will be assured that every-
thing possible is being done to make
this Junior Prom the best one ever
held at Pitt. On the other hand it is
the obligation of everyone in the class
to support the Prom. There are some
individuals who will be unable to buy
tickets, but that should not prevent
them from giving their moral sup-
port, If it is at all feasible the price
will be somewhat less than in former
years, and with this hoped-for reduc-
tion I am looking forward to more
people being able to attend.”

Reduction From‘ Last Year’s
Price Of $2 Is Made
A Effe_l:tive

By Charles;B. Holstein

What the members choose to ca.ll
“A Christmas '
you” has been decided upon by the
committee for thefgf annual informal
Yuletide Festival dance Friday night
at the Grotto ballroom in the form of

- a 50-cent reduction in the price of

_ tickets. . .

,1 The advancesale of tickets for the
laffair at the original price of $2 has
{been so encouraging, according to
‘John Gourley, D34,7:.cl1airman, that the
iprice has been lofwered to $1.50 to
give even a greatfer number of stu-
dents an opportunity to attend. Al-
though the proﬁtsigwhich may accrue
from the dance have already been
pledged to the Student Chest drive,
Gourley asserted_fthat the intention is
not to clear am if  money as pos-
sible for.‘this.‘firoj  but to make the
affair a campus fitride, all-University
dance in-more than name. He esti-
‘inatedf tlii3ct**a’tjstiie”‘iiéW*‘price,"1l0:o cou-
ples should attend.

At $1.50 the‘.Festival dance takes a
place along side of the Spring Fes-
tival sports dance last semester as
one of the most inexpensive major
dances in University history. Also at
the Grotto and at the same price the

 

sports dance drew between 600 and
700 couples.
Miss Christine Daly of Windber,

the hometown of the chairman, has
been invited by Gourley to be dance
queen. Miss Daly was graduated
from Hood college last year. The
grand march, which the chairman and
Miss Daly will lead, has been moved
up to 10 o’clock, at which time at-
tractive dance programs will be dis-
tributed. The affair itself is sched-
uled from 9 to 1 o’clock.

Al Buhl and his Red Peppers will
occupy the orchestra platform for the

unit which gained a campus reputa-
tion last month at the Interfraternity
conference dance.

The new price of $1.50 is a pre-sale
price, Gourley declared, and will con-
tinue until Friday noon. He urged
that advantage be taken of the bar-
gain price by an early purchase of
tickets.

Tickets are on sale in the oﬁice of
the dean of men, at the School of
Dentistry, with William Daufenbach
in Alumni hall, with Charles B. Hol-
stein, C36, in the News oﬁice, and
with the following members of the
committee: Gourley; John Wyeth,
C35; Skip Kleeb, BA34; King Derr,
C35; Jess Pennington, D35; H. B.
Stevenson. BA34; Nathan Alpern,

F. D. McCloy Is Speaker
At Philological Meeting

F. Dixon Mccloy was the speaker

ciety in the home of Dr. M. T. Her-
rick, associate professor of English,
Saturday night.

Mr, McCloy’s subject was “Barlaam
in the Byzantine and Italian Renais-
sance.” At the time of a renewed
literary, artistic. and scientiﬁc con-
sciousness in the Byzantine empire,
Barlaam became a brilliant protagon-
ist of humanism in opposition to
theological mysticism. Later, as an
exile in Itaily, Barlaam introduced
the study of Greek to the humanists
of the Italian renaissance.

“Let The Stage, Not

You To Act,” Says Eva LeGa1lienne

 

By Leah Stark
“If you want to be an actress, go
on the stage as soon as possible,” de-
clares Eva Le Gallienne, She claims
that (the stage itself is the only place

to learn acting, and she herself has
been “learning” since 14, when she
went on the stage. Miss Le Gallienne
thinks that one can learn the other
necessary things outside of school.
“I could never see the purpose of tak-
ing algebra and other such unneces-
sary things, because I hated them,”
she says.

It is upon the college students of
today that Miss Le Gallienne is de-
pending to further the purpose of the

of people at a minimum price. She
expects that the government must
help, of course. According to Miss
Le Gallienne, the government spends
millions of dollars yearly for mate-
rial things, but nothing for drama
and the appreciation of beauty. In
order to discuss an appropriation of
this sort, she has been preparing for
an interview with President Roose-
velt.

Miss Le Gallienne is not disturbed
that the talkies may rival the stage.
“To my mind there is no rivalry;
they are different mediums,” she
said. Although the talkies have taken
some people away from the theater,
she believes that the stage is coming
back. In fact, she thinks that it is at
one of its greatest days now.

Suggestions To Council

CREDITABLE PROGRESS has
been made i11 the 11-polnt
program adopted by Student
Council in September. Most of
the deﬁnite points in the program
have been worked out successful-
ly, others have failed, and one or
two are still being worked on. In
the instance of the grid graph,
Council did everything possible
to make the project successful,
but Council ’s efforts were voided
by a disinterested student body.
The honor roll has not been issued
yet, and we hope that the end of
the current semester will see the
project materialized. The pep
assembly, scheduled on the ‘Ved-
nesday before the Notre Dame
game, was successful, as was the
opening of several smoking rooms
in University buildings. The trol-
ley car rate reductions are still
being worked on, and Council
should speed up this work as
much as possible. Points six and
ten of the Council program, be-
cause of their broadness and
vagueness, will be passed over.
Point nine, however, hasn’t been
elaborated to any extent. The
section calls for “assemblies,
featured by prominent speakers,
arranged with the YMCA.” N0
large student assemblies of this
kind have yet taken place or have
yet been scheduled. This point
we are forced to call a failure. It
can -be carried over, however, to-
gether with the trolley fare ques-
tion, into the next series that
Council undertakes.

HILE THE EXECUTIVE

committee of Council ponders
additional activities, the Pitt
News would suggest several:

1. Student-controlled and stu-
dentsponsored intramural ath-
letic, forensic, and literary activ-
ities. Council can appoint com-
mittees to take care of this work.
The recent voluntary organization
of seven intramural football
teams in the University is indi-
-cation enough that students are
interested in doing things.

2. Creation of a Student Ath-
letic council to supervise all intra-
mural athletics. The president of
this council can be the student
representative on the University
Athletic council on which there is
‘no student representation. (This
is an elaboration of point one.)

3. Organization of an under-
graduate board. of publications
consisting of a member of Coun-
cil and the editors and business
managers of the three large un-
dergraduate publications.

4.’ Radical change in the oﬂice
locations of the Pitt News, the
Panther, the Owl, and the student
activities to relieve the conges-
tion and eliminate the noise in
Room 801, Cathedral.

5. Establishment of an activi-
ties conference every month by a
committee composed of one mem-
ber of Council and two members
each from Omicron Delta Kappa
and Mortar Board. The activi-
ties conference will cooperate
with undergraduate activities in
meeting their various problems.

6. Creation of undergraduate
forensic and literary boards to
supervise intramural competition
in debating, writing, etc. The
boards will be composed of a
member of Council and several of
the outstanding persons in cam-
pus forensic and literary activi-
ties.

Golomb Addresses Group
On “Freudian Psychology’

Norman Golomb, C35, will speak at
the next meeting of Pi Tau Phi, hon-
orary scholastic fraternity in the Col-
lege. On “A Glance at Freudian
Psychology." The meeting will take
place at 8 o'clock Thursday evening
in the Faculty club rooms of the Hotel
Schenley.

 

Let Students Write
The Show

OSSIBILITIES FOR a student-

written Cap and Gown show this
year gather more and more momentum
with the interest shown by a number
of Pitt students who have written
librettos for the annual musical pro-
duction. In the past, every cry for
a student-written show was hailed as
the annual inauguration of the Cap
and Gown season and was greeted
with customary indifference by the
student body.

Unofﬁcial reports indicate that at
least four excellent student books
are under consideration by the com-
mittee which decides whose book shall
be used. General impressions among
students and faculty members who
have read the student productions in-
dicate that the books show evidence
of student interest in the show.

There should be little hesitancy on
the part of the committee in the
selection of the libretto. An excellent
student-written show might be only a
“good” graduate-written show, but as

a method which might increase stu-
dent interest in Cap and Gown activ-
ities the student books should be con-
sidered, Even a revue, partly products
of students and partly of experienced
graduates. would be welcome, It
would at least be an indication that
students are ﬁnally becoming inter-
ested in writing Cap and Gown shows.

By Wilbur D. Clark

Tommy Rot, Sec’y.,
Council for the Fostering of Better

Taste.

My Dear Mr. Rot:

Thank you, Mr. Rot and the Coun-
cil for the Fostering of Better Taste,
for the communication concerning
this column. It is seldom that one
is fortunate enough to receive a di-
rect expression from your council,
Realizing that your task is a great
one, that you must be kept busy in
your efforts to improve our tastes, I
feel ﬂattered to have heard from

you.

From time to time, one hears a
reader say that “this is lousy” or
‘that is terrible.” It is plain that
their expressions are valueless to us
who would improve. But you present
a clear analysis of our faults, and
so we owe to you a debt of gratitude.

I realize now that I have met
members of the Council. They wear
long beards and chew their lips while
they read. Or have I confused my-
self, mistaking another guild for
yours‘? I did not realize that the look
of pain on their faces was a fault of
mine. In the future I will be more
careful about ﬁlling valleys with
sound, about writing of bath tubs,
and about using water that makes so
much silence in splashing.

It is regrettable that your members
die from time to time, otherwise your
Council would attain proportions
more suited to the fulﬁllment of the
gigantic task that you have set your-
-self about. Certainly yours is a no-
ble purpose; it is ﬁtting and proper-
that you should prescribe for us. It
is only through your persistent efforts
that the world can ever be made to
know good taste. We are not cap-
able of distinguishing for ourselves
between what is in good taste and
what is in bad taste. Your service to
mankind cannot be overestimated. It
is a gross injustice that we haven't
recognized your importance before.
We should have rewarded you.
Perhaps it is not yet too late, It a
stone structure were built for the
Council in some far-off spot where you
might spend the rest of your years stu-
dying our errors, sending the results
of your thought back to us only by
courier, would you be winning to ac-
cept this token of our affection? It
is too long that we have delayed; it
is time that we do something,

Thank you again for your letter,
and I hope that I will hear from you
soon to the effect that the Council is
willing to accept the proposition men-
tioned above.

May good taste ﬁnally prevail over
evil,

Yours truly,
MISTEJR.

.It’s All In The

Life’s All Ups And Downs

By Reuben -Slesinger
It may be the week before the Christmas vacation to you, but
"it’s just another week of stops——28,500 of thcm—-—for the ﬁve elevator

 

operators in the Cathedral.

The four passenger elevators make about 7,942 trips in an aver-
.age week, or 3,971 round trips. That amounts to almost 2,000 trips
per elevator per week, and so you need not think that the elevators
are just for your two trips to the%

eighth ﬂoor. In an average week
thesefour elevators make 28,500 sep-
.-arate stops.

If you like travel, get a job as an
elevator operator. They cover about
350 miles in a week. Besides, they
‘barely creep up the 441 feet from the
ﬁrst to the thirty-sixth ﬂoor in 42
:seconds, or at a rate of about 700
-feet per minute, or 12 miles per hour.
.(Do you still think you can walk up
-the steps faster?)

When you're waiting for the eleva-
stor on the thirteenth ﬂoor and begin
xto call Bill those pet names that you
usually reserve for the auto when it
-won’t start these cold mornings, re-

member that it is 162 feet from the
ﬁrst floor to the thirteenth and that
without any stops it takes the eleva-
tor only 15 seconds to reach you.
Actual timing with a stop watch
shows that when a student waits 15
«seconds for the elevator he usually is
willing to swear that he has waited
:three or four minutes,

In the last three months, 2,505 peo-
.-ple have visited the tower on the top
-of the Cathedral, and 20,093 visitors
Fhave been taken to the top since
,July, 1931.

Technical Employment

Outlook Favorable,
Says Roberts

The outlook for employment of
technical graduates is extremely
favorable as compared with the
outlook in other ﬁelds, according
to an address made by E. B.
Roberts of the Westinghouse
Electric and Manufacturing com-
pany before the Land Grant col-
lege association in Chicago the
other day.

“The rate of population growth
has ceased,” Roberts said, “The.
relative. number of youth. in the
population has been halved since
1850 and in another 20 years will
be halved again. This is decided-
ly a factor on the bright side, so
far as the placement of graduates
is concerned.”

Roberts explained that although
only half of the better positions
in the business world are held by
college graduates, the proportion
is increasing.

The fact that enrollment in the
engineering schools of the coun-
try is decreasing as compared
with the increase in the business
and professional schools was an-
other argument, Roberts, said,

' suggesting the belief that the
technical student of the future
will have a better chance to make

By Ruth Sochatoff

“Swell”—“no spirit”—“too much
cheating" “great football team."
That’s Pitt, or so said ten women
transfers when asked what they think
of the University.

Alice Barchﬁeld, Wilson college:
“What I think of Pitt? Oh, I think
it’s swell; in fact, it's perfect. You
know, it's so much fun going to a
coed‘ school. Besides, it seems as if
everybody is so easy to get along
with. I surely do like it.”

Newana Kamerer, Western Re-
serve university: “You want my
frank opinion? Well, I believe there
is a. lack of spirit, the real school
spirit every college should have. 1
also miss the honor system which we
had at Western Reserve; there is far
too much cheating at Pitt. I miss
the dormitory life, but the coeduca-
tional system makes up for it. You
know, men have opinions once in a
while, and it’s rather interesting to
hear them,

Katheryn Kohberger, Ohio univer-
sity: “There's one thing Ohio had
that Pitt seems to lack, and that’s a
bunch of good looking boys. Oh, I
wouldn't say there aren't any around
here, but, gee, those at Ohio! The
girls at Pitt are all right, I suppose.
Some are sociable; some are not, As
for the work, I find the English
course much harder here at Pitt. It’s
got me down.”

Elsie Groat, Allegeheny college:
“Pitt? Well, I certainly like it. Al-
legheny, you know, is a much smaller
college, but I guess I like crowds.
Then, too, I like the boys and girls;
they’re so sociable."

Margaret Huey, Ohio Wesleyan
university: “Of course going to Pitt

Women Transfers Fete
Organization Leaders

VVomen transfers will entertain the
officers, faculty advisers, and commit-
tee members of the women’s organ-
izations at Heinz House on Thursday
at 3 o’clock, to show their apprecia-
tion for a series of luncheons given in
their honor,

Tea will be served from 3 to 3545
o’clock, immediately following which
will be a program given by the trans-
fers. An informal dance at 4 o’clock
will conclude the affair.

A novel idea will be innovated at
the door_ In order to distinguish be-
tween the hostesses and guests,
feathers will be passed out, blue to
the transfers and gold to the organi-
zations. _

The guests for the afternoon Wlll
include WSGA, office of the dean Of
women, Panhellenic council, YWCA,
WAA, and Glee club. All transfer
women who wish to show their appre-
ciation to these 0I'gaI1iZati0I1S are

urged to attend.

is much diﬁerent from going away,
but I like it. The students are so
democratic, much more so than I
thought any students could be.
They’re sociable too, and have swell
spirit. What more can I say?”

Nancy Kennard, Dennison univer-
sity: “I ﬁnd just one fault with Pitt,
the dilficulty in getting acquainted.
The transfer luncheons were lovely,
and the girls did their best to help
us feel at home, but somehow I just
don’t seem to get around. The work
is O. K., I guess, but awfully tough."

Ada. Bella, Bethany college: “I'm
just cuh-razy about the football team.
Of course, Bethany had a team, too
but it wasn't quite as good as Pitt's.
But that’s what I like about Pitt.
When you're away, and somebody
wants to know what school you go
to, and you say Pitt, they always
answer: ‘Oh, the school with the
good football team.’ It makes me
feel so proud.”

Mary Baer, University of Chicago:
“Of Pitt? I really haven't formed
any real opinion yet. I think I'd like
to be back at Chicago—they have a
gorgeous campus, you know—but I
should be satisﬁed. Everybody seems
sociable enough."

Lavenia Elder, Maryville college:
“Because Maryville was so much
smaller than Pitt, I felt rather be-
wildered, but that feeling has passed.
The transfer luncheons helped a lot.
And I like the idea of going to 9.
school that excels in athletics; there's
so much more enthusiasm and
spirit.”

Sally Tarbell, Bouve-Boston School
of Physical Education: “I do not wish
to commit myself.” “But . ." "I
said that I did not wish to commit
myself. Good day.”

The Medicine Man

The Campus Scout I

The large turnout at Dr. H. C. Carlson ’s fourth annual basket-
ball clinic last Saturday was another tribute to the good doctor.
The high esteem that Dr. Carlson holds among high school and col-

lege coaches accounts for the tremendous turnout.

At least 3,000

coaches, players, and fans jammed the stadium pavilion Saturday

morning and afternoon and came away satisﬁed.

After being

treated to an exhibition of the Pitt and Duquesne systems, in addi-

tion to many other features of the¢

clinic that included speeches by sev-
eral visiting coaches, the group
watched one of the ﬁnest exhibitions
of basketball seen in any Pitt opener,
the Panther-Georgetown game.

The latest edition of the Panther
basketball annual seems molded on
the lines of past quintets. The team
still features non-skid passing, speedy
cutting, and close guarding. The play
of Russ Ochsenhirt was exceptionally
pleasing, especially to one who has
seen this same gentleman fail to make
a high school squad for two years,
and then crash through to share the
captaincy of the Pitt basketball ma-
chine, Charley Hughes seems to have
been elected as the man to call fouls
on this season. For some reason or
other, the oiiicials seem to pick on the
veteran. Although his playing was no
different from that of the other guards
on the ﬂoor, Charley was the man the
oﬂicials pointed to when fouls were
called.

The classy ball-handling demonstra-
tion that Claire Cribbs delights to
give appreciative audiences was as
good as ever. However, the Scout
hopes that nothing goes wrong with
these exhibitions at a crucial time.
Skip Hughes, Don Mccamant, and

Slim Waino performed as expected,.

smoothly. Once more Wainio gives
promise of turning in a few more
heartbreaks for rival coaches and
heart failure to Pitt backers.

The Oﬁicials

The new system of oﬂiciating at
games in the Eastern Intercollegiate
Basketball conference received its
trial at the Hoya game, and this de-
partment is not satisﬁed with the re-
sult.

Naturally, the crowd can be expect-
ed to boo the ofﬁcials at some stages
of the game, but the attitude of the
“papered” house has had no bearing
on these paragraphs_ The two officials
handled the game closely, and kept it
under control during the ﬁrst half.
The second half saw a reversal of
form. As the going became faster,
the game seemed to slip away from
the oﬂicials.

The calling of “steps” was espe-
cially negelected. Players on both
teams took liberties with this laxity.
Quite a few avoided penalties result-
ed in ﬁeld goals, In addition, the of-
ﬁcials seemed reluctant to call the
fourth personal foul during the last
few moments of play. Had the fouls
been called, neither team would have
had its starting lineup available to
ﬁnish the game.

 

Swimming Team
Wins AMA Meet

At Keystone Club

Coach Corr’s Tankers Place
In All Events; Relay Team
Smashes Old Record

 

Saturday evening, at the Keystone
Athletic club, the Pitt swimming team
continued its superior performance in
Allegheny Mountain association com-
petition to come out the winner for
the third time in three meets, To
capture ﬁrst place Coach Pat Corr’s
entries scored points in all the men’s
events for a total of 17 points. The
Pittsburgh Boys’ club ﬁnished second
with ﬁve points and the Duquesne
Dolphins took third place with one
point,

In the Junior 50-yard freestyle
championship, which was changed to
an invitation race in order to give the
Keystone club the right to reject
entry blanks, the ﬁve Panther swim-
mers entered all qualiﬁed for the
semi-ﬁnals. After the semi-ﬁnals
Keck and Madden were disqualiﬁed,
but Lewis, Ruhe, and Geyer were still
in the running. In the ﬁnal of the 50-
yard event Gates, of the Boys’ club
touched the ﬁnish line ahead of the
ﬁeld to win the event in 25.3 seconds.
Lewis of Pitt came in right behind
Gates, followed by Ruhe, another
Panther swimmer, to give Pitt a sec-
ond and third.

In the 300-yard medley race a. Pitt
team composed of Russell Lindberg,
Joseph Schmeiler, and Jack Denny
set a new AMA record_ They turned
in the time of three minutes and 20
seconds which is three seconds bet-
ter than the old record. Another Pitt
relay team composed of Jones, Adlers-
berg, and Hanna ﬁnished second. The
third place in the medley went to the
Duquesne team by a one-ﬁfth of a sec-
ond margin. The Duquesne team
turned in a time of 3.29, which was
only one-ﬁfth of a second better than
the time of a Pitt team composed of
Swazuk, M,uzyk, and Stinner.

John Carik and Robert McTeirnan
tied for ﬁrst place in the Senior AMA
low-board diving championship-. Harry
Wagner and George Myers, both div-
ing in their ﬁrst competitive meet
were barely nosed out of third place
by Gasper, of the Pittsburgh Aquatic
club.

Panthers Topple
Hoyas In Opener
At Stadium, 34-31

Ochsenhirt Leads Pitt Scorers
As Carlson Quintet Wins
Annual Clinic Game

 

Pitt’s Golden Panthers topped
Georgetown’s Hoyas in a see-saw
struggle Saturday night and en-
trenched themselves in ﬁrst place in
the Eastern Intercollegiate basketball
conference. The score was 34-31.

After the ﬁrst ten minutes of the
game had gone by without the semb-
lance of a ﬁeld goal by either team,
Claire Cribbs dropped in the ﬁrst Pitt
two-pointer of the year and started
the Panthers off to a slight lead
which they held rather consistently
throughout the game. Georgetown’s
work at the foul line kept them in the
ball game during the ﬁrst half, and
the gun sounded for the intermission
with the 14-13 score looking none too
safe for Pitt.

Connors put Georgetown ahead at
the start of the second half with a
ﬁeld goal, but. Russ Ochsenhirt and
Slim Wainio counted a basket each
and thereafter the Panthers were
never headed. Ochsenhirt continued
to roll up his" scoring total and gar-
nered 12 points for the eve-ning’s
work. ’Cribbs sank three ﬁeld goals
and a like number of foul shots to
take second honors in the Panther
scoring with nine points,

and was very handy at dropping in
three ﬁeld goals in spots when the
Panthers were able to use them, Pitt
used only six men and each of them
broke into the scoring column.
Another remarkable feature of the
game was that on no less than 14 oc-
casions a player crashed into the wall
under the basket at the west end of
the ﬂoor and suffered no injury. This
does not include the 11 instances
when players picked themselves up
from the laps of spectators around the
other three sides of the floor.

THE PITT NEWS

Seven Recommended For 3
Letters By Coach Olson

 

There is but one more act to per-
form before the 1933 cross-country
season can be deﬁnitely wiped off the
books. That act deals with the award-
ing of letters and numerals to the var-
sity and freshmen men whose work
has merited such recognition.

Coach Olson, in a letter addressed
to the University athletic council, has
recommended the following men as
worthy of receiving the varsity “P,”:
William Lawrence, honorary cap-
tain; James Watkins, William Al-
bright, Kenneth Wagenhouser,
George Cook, Samuel M,usico, and
David De Marche. _

Those freshmen recommended to
receive their class insignia are: Ed-
win Beachler, Lawrence Buvinger,
Alexander Leggin, Michael Matzko,
Elliot Montroll, John Pfaff, Walter
Radosevich, Walter Rauck, James
Shields, Michael Sivak, Harold Tost,
Dale Van Ormer, and George Prosnik.

Cub Cagers Whip
Perry High, 48-16

Section 2 Champs No Match For
Panthers In Opener

 

Paul Zehfuss’s freshman cagers
showed plenty of promise when they
swamped the Perry high school ag-
gregation, 48-16, in the preliminary to
the Pitt-Georgetown tussle Saturday.

Billy Jesko and Ralph Ferguson,
Panther forwards, were the high
point scorers for the frosh, each get-
ting four ﬁeld goals. Russ Emerick
and Jim Rowe, guards, each had three
two-pointers and one foul to his
credit.

Bob Kornick was the outstanding
performer for Perry, last year’s Sec-
tion II champs in the city league.
His three goals and three fouls made
him high point man of the game.

The Perryites gave the little
Panthers a good battle during the
early stages of the game but the frosh
had a little too much power for the
scholastics.

Pitt Riﬂe Team
Completes Trials

Candidates Failing To Score 350

Automatically Dropped
____ _ Where’s Elmer?

The football world these days is not
asking, “Where’s Elmer?” Every fan
knows that Elmer is headed for the
coaching job at his alma. mater,
Notre Dame.

Pitt’s relations with Elmer Layden
have been pleasant. The Panthers
have met Layden-coached Duquesne
teams twice and have won both times.
Both times they met well-coached,
hard but clean ﬁghting elevens.

Elmer Layden goes to Notre Dame
with the best wishes of all those in-
terested in Pitt football. Like Rip
Miller, Navy coach, they say “Good
wishes to Elmer Layden, but may the
touchdowns his team makes against
us be few and far between.”

“Win ’Em All”

Dr. Carlson's basketball team got
off on the right foot Saturday night
by defeating a strong Georgetown
team. Winning them all isn’t going
to be so easy as can be seen by look-
ing at the Panther schedule. This
Friday night the cagers meet Purdue
at Lafayette; Saturday night, North-
western at Evanston; and Monday
night, Butler at Indianapolis. Last
season the Panthers lost to North-
western, 31 to 22, and won over But-
ler, 38 to 30, and over Purdue, 33 to
38. If they win two out of three on
their trip west this year they will
be doing well.

Last year the Pitt basketball team
won 16 games and lost 5. They won
over Georgetown, Minnesota, Butler,
Purdue, Temple, twice, Carnegie
twice, Notre Dame, West Virginia

After ﬁve weeks of practice shoot-
ing, the Riﬂe team, coached by Lieu-
tenant A. E. Wilson, held its ﬁrst
try-out shooting match in order to cut
from the squad any candidate who
failed to score at least 350 in four po-
sitions: prone, sitting, kneeling, and
standing.

Those who scored a total of at least
350 in the try-out shooting are:
Hykes, Voegtly, Duff, Davis, Shapiro,
Zoeller, Truman, Atkinson, Welter-
shausen, Mastrucci, Frabatta, Dor-
rance, Miller, and Reizenstein.

The men who qualiﬁed will com-
pete to decide the members of the
second and third teams from now un-
til January 3. Thereafter, scores will
be compared every week throughout
the season and the members of the
different teams will be placed in order
of shooting ability on teams A, B,
and C.
