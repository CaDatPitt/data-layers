R u t h Maguire has

vice president

Government

, her. reasons for her decision.

She said that in pre-elec-

tion activities she did not ﬁnd
adepuate competition for the po-
sitions that are to be ﬁlled, and
she felt it was unfair to see the
electorate to have a single group
of close assiciates and party pa-
trons to attempt ‘to control gov-
ernment through machine tactics.

“I feel that I am qualiﬁed not

only by my desire to assume and
carry out the responsibilities of
vice-president of Student Gov-
ernment, but also by my past
year’s experience with SG as
senator, and as chairman of the
pep committee.’ ‘
Realizes Responsibilities

She added that she fully real-
ized the responsibilities of the vice
president and feels conﬁdent that
she will be able to effectively lead
the senate in a positive direction,
if elected to oﬁice.

Miss Maguire said that she
hoped that, as an independent
candidate, her chances for elec-
tion to the vice presidency
would not be hampered by an
orgaiz‘ ed group standing be-

, hind her opponent.
“It was I who pushed for a
student referendum to decide the
fate of the present Student Gov-
ernment” Miss Maguire remark-
ed. On being asked her opinion
of the presidental candidate, she
said that she considered him very
competent and she felt sure that
he will prove a valuablea sset to
Student Government.
Menzer Notices Ineligibility
David Menzer, chairman of the
elections Committee, commented
that “Miss Maguire and Miss Gail
Michaliszyn, a senatorial candi-
date from the School of Education
are in-eligible.”

“Miss Maguire does not at the
present time have adequate
credit hours for the vice pres-

idency and Miss Michaleszyn is

In commenting upon his candidacy, Raschella
said, Men’s Council’s chief function to the Uni-

“To accomplish these worthy goals,” he con-

and the ability to work with one another in achiev-

Modern “Witch Doctor” Uses Action in Midday Program

BY PAT CHERKIN
Anyone who attended the Mid-
day Series “talk” by Dr. Hubert

Alyea, realizes how impossible it

is to summarize what he “said.”

Based on the theory that “ac-
tions speak louder than words,”
the Princeton chemist ran madly
around the stage for an hour

building ﬁres, drawing pictures, ‘

shooting guns at the audience,
eating dry ice. joking, gurgling,
giggling and talking incessantly.

His antics, reminiscent of a
trained monkey or a modern-day
witch doctor, were in support of
the title of his speech, “Lucky
Accidents, Great Discoveries, And
The Prepared Mind.” He demon-
strated and told how lucky acci-
dents had been responsible for
great discoveries in plastics, drugs,
and atomic energy.

Stayed Serious

In the midst of upi-carious
laughter” from the audience, he
was serious about his topic, con-
stantly emphasizing that “there

ready to capitalize on the lucky
accident.”
Polcmerization, responsible for
a huge variety of plastics, was
discussed, using at DuPont chem-
ist’s accidental discovery of
Teﬂon as an example of the pro-
cess. '

In drugs, Alexander Fleming’s
discovery of life-saving penicyl-\
lin was typical of “out to lunch”
accidents he said. In a certain
culture bacteria refused to grow
in one spot, so Fleming trans-
planted the substance of that bar-
ren spot and got the same results.
The substance was tested‘ in mice
who resisted bacteria too, and to-
day many people are saved by
what is now penicyllin.

Sings Princeton Song

Bcccerrel in 1895 had a lucky
accident and made a great dis-
covery which led to the atom
bomb. Dr. Alyea demonstrated the
difference between slow and fast

to correspond with the Ivy Lea-

To attain the prepared mind
he suggested “quality learning
and quality living.” Most im-
portant, he noted: “Don’t. be-

»In summation Dr. Alyea told

  Popular Programming  

This evening from 3:30 to 9:30 and Wednesday eve-

‘ning’ from 9:00 to 10:00 WPGH will broadcast an on the

scene report of astronaut John Glenn’s homecoming to

A’ New Concord. I

This alone is notan outstanding feat, for local radio

and TV stations have already carried the story.‘ But the
‘ fact that ﬁve university students, in an effort to bring na-

tional as well as local news to campus travelled 125 miles
to New Concord this past weekend to obtain the story,

 should not go unnoticed.

With their limited equipment, namely, three much-

A worn tape recorders and as many direct pointing thumbs,

these students, Dave Crawford, Phil Wise, Bud Lange, Dick
Rauh and Dan Johnson actuallycovered on thescene ac-

tion in order to‘brin_g this University closer to the major

‘national event in quite some time. Glenn’s speech, the pa-
rade, the press conference, and private interviews are all

;included in the one hour tape. _
,  Such programming only- epitomizes the work WPGH
has done in its three month scheduling on campus. Inspite

of the red tape and -unexpected difficulties’ encountered
with interception and insufficient power, WPGH has man-
aged to present programs of considerable value on tuition,

student government, and Midday events to those few-stu-,
dents who can and will listen.

‘i: Student Government’s grant for the installation of the

...new $300 coaxial cable should boost the station’s frequency
to full strength. This grant is the ﬁrst step in the recogni-

tion so deserved bythese students. The’University has also
planned a resident student poll to determine the .exact.

times and places radio interference occurs in the Quad-
wrangle. In this way they hope to eliminate the static which

has so constantly hindered WPGH. from reaching as many
people as it otherwise could.

in '.  If every dormitory studentwill give just a few minutes
0 a day to help locatethe trouble, WPGH can become a most

effective news and entertainment media bn campus. To-
night’s program shows a skill in reporting and editing not

.’ often found on a university radio station.

,We feel WPGH has more than proven its worth after so '
0 many years of trial and error and a determination to suc-
ceed. We, as students, must now do our part to make sure
I it stays.

to giving my mother’s contemporaries, I asked

,what she meant.

“I’ve read all the books he assigned years ag0-
The one he’s discussing today,
for example, I’ve read at least
25 or 30 times. Not only that,
but he doesn’t even pick the
authors’ best works. But then
I guess he ﬁgures you children
wouldn’t understand really good
literature.”

“Maybe he ﬁgures everyone’s
already read the best ones.”

_ Meanwhile I wondered if I
would. ever reach the point ‘
where I have read everything
worthwhile and can begin rereading the better
books that many times.

During the few weeks that I have known‘ this
woman, she has rarely failed to remind me how
watered down our course is, howilittle my genera-
tion has to know, and how many books she has
read. At first, in sentences as full of “I’s” as a bale

of needles, she was most_intent on making it clear -

that she is actually an il1—scheduled graduate
«student. Now this is recalled only a few times
daily.

Condescension ls Common

This woman represents a breed which is all too
common at this University —— the older student
who resents mingling with his intellectual inferiors.
Not all of the breed are graduate students; nor are
they all that much older than I.

But they have other traits in common. First of
all, they are all endowed with a phenomenal
amount of knowledge.‘ They are so uncommonly
learned that the process of obtaining a degree
proves it is boring. This is evident from the num-
ber of cuts they can afford; the variety of distrac-
tions they can ﬁnd during class; and the few notes
they need take. Even tests are a drag, judging

 

from their comments afterward, not their hurried»
scribbling as the tests are collected.

Also, members of this gifted clan are extremely...
concerned that no one misunderstand their status. I
If they are graduate students, they will pointedly

mention it during the ﬁrst few moments of conver. _ ~ T

cation and every other sentence thereafter —-— no
one must mistake them for lowly undergraduates.-
If they are undergraduates they have taught for

Finally, their most unifying characteristic is that

concealed scorn.
endure

they must suffer, they must also persist in re-
minding us of ‘their, plight. Unfortunately their
withering disdain is not limited to students;
teachers are as guilty as we and even easier tox,
criticize. ‘
Preiudices Differ _

I have distorted the problem of course. Older‘
students and graduate students are not nearly this
obnoxious. The difference between them and me
is simply that we, have diﬁerent sets‘ of prejudices:
as a young, unmarriedimale undergraduate I look
upon life from a different angle than a woman
twice my age who has raised a family and is now
studying for an advanced degree. They have had

far more experience and although I ‘may sneer tat ,

it I must still recognize that it has some value; I,
on the other hand, am probably not nearly so en-I
cumbered with set attitudes not applicable ‘to
present situations. ,

They are further handicapped in that while I
am surrounded by people of my own generation
who in general think as I do, they are distinctly.
among the minority and, feeling keenly the dis-
parity between our views, must react defensively.

Still, I would remind them that ourprofessors
are in relatively the samesituation and have found
that we can exist in harmony only if they do not
ﬂaunt their wider experience or attempt to impress
their divergent views.

Editor, The Pitt News:
In‘ the February 21 Pitt‘ News,
Guy Loucks wrote a letter attack-

‘ ing the recent Washington Peace

Action of the Student Committee
of Turn Towards Peace. “
Incidentally, for people who
have not yet heard of Turn ‘To-
wards Peace, let me say that it

is an organization_ set up and sup-

ported by a number of existing
organizations, such as: United
Auto Workers, AFL-CIO; Inter-
national Union of Electrical

0 Workers, AFL—CIO; American As-

sociation for the United Nations
and many others.

Apparently Mr. Loucks never
bothered to read the literature of
the organization’ when he states
that the organization favors uni-
lateral disarmament and that it
advocates “throwing. down our

arms and trusting to Russia’s hu-

manitarian? conscience.”

Turn Towards Peace does.op—
pose the resumption of atmo-
spheric testing, which we feel will
only lead to new Russian testing,
and intensify the arms race. We
advocate certain American initia-
tives in the ﬁeld of multilateral
disarmament, such as a declara-
tion that the United States will

pnot give’ nuclear weapons to West

Germany -or other countries which
do not now have them.

Turn Towards Peace is very
clear about its own beliefs. Its
program begins: “We wish to
meet squarely the danger pre-
sented’ to democratic" ,values by
Soviet ideology and Communist
expansionism.” It alsq states:
“Turn Toward Peace begins with

the». recognition t_hat;f~ phanges in

to say: “But present American

policies are not likely to elicit

such Soviet changes as other poli-
cies might... Turn Towards Peace
is an attempt by a number of ma-
jor American organizations to
find alternative policies which
are not the threat of war and are
not surrender.” ’ I

The pr lem of preventing war
is a staggering complicated and
difficult one, and‘ honest men may

well disagree about how to do so.’

Becket Begins
"Three-Day Run
Friday Night

Pitt Players’ production of Jean
Anouhil’s high comedy “Becket”
will be presented Friday at 8:30
p.m., Saturday at 2:30 and 8:30
pm., and Sunday at 2:30 and 8:30
p_m_ in the Commons Room, CL.
Tickets, at $1.25, are on sale at
the Book Center and at the Stu-
dent Desk, CL. Special group
rates are available at the Speech
Department, ext. 371.

“Becket” was written in French

‘and translated into English by

Lucienne Hill. It is the story, of
the relationship between Henry
11, King of England, and his more
intellectual friend, Becket. They
are at ﬁrst friends, but become
enemies as Becket joins the hier-
archy Of the Church.

The play on Broadway in 1960,
with Sir Lawrence Olivier and
Anthony Quinn in the lead roles.
Some critics comments have been:
“absorbing and distinguished new
drama of ideas . . . ‘Becket’ is a
notable event in the theatre”
(Richard Watts, Jr., N.Y. Post),
“brilliant, exciting and big.”
(John Chapman, N.Y. Daily

Commons Room Used

The Commons Room, is being
used to add an air of authenti-
city and will contribute to the
pageantry of the processions.
Bernard Engel, director, at his ar-
rival here last year, was struck
by the architecture of the Cathe-
dral and its theatrical possibilities
and picked “Becket” partly be-
cause its medieval setting would
ﬁt in with the architecture.

The play is being done in 3/4
round, with seating on three
sides and most entrances from
behind a curtain hung in the

.. karch toward Bigelow Boulevard.
‘Scenery will be changed by the
use of a movable platform which
slides out from behind the cur-
tains.

Two pipe towers will be used
for all the lighting effects, and
the banners which set the scene
will be hung from the upper
ﬂoors.

Commons Room furniture will
be used for many of the scenes
along «with thrones, an altar,
celastic horses and falcons, and

Sports Editor,

“It Goes On..."

NOTHING LIKE THE OL’ SWIMMING HOLE
Standing within the shell of the forthcoming physical
education unit across from the Field House, amidst the rub-
ble that resembled Pompei after the lava had been swept
away, Swimming Coach Ben Grady was snapping his cam-
era as enthusiastically as a schoolboy with his ﬁrst brownie
camera. 
With an effervescent smile as wide as a butterﬂy swim-
mer’s wing-spread, Grady snapped the shutters at every-
thing from soot-stained laborers and dusty water pipes to
drainage sewer lids and an empty concrete mass which will
eventually be his pool. » ‘

“I guess you’ve waited a long time for something like
this,” Iasked the veteran swim coach.

‘ “Just 23 years,” Grady said with a satirical passiveness.
“When I came here in 1939, they promised me a pool to
work in. They’ve made good on their promise, a little late,
but in grand style.”

Dusty Outlook

And despite the fact that everything is covered with
more dirt than furniture in an antique shop, it is easy to vis-
ualize the grandeur of the building. Grady pointed out every
unique aspect of the structure that came to mind.

He singled out the indirect lighting system, the elevated
oiﬁcials’. balcony, the observation windows, which soon will
be under water. Grady squeezed down a manhole to get to

. this latter position, and quickly took a picture, saying, “This

may be the last chance I have to get this particular view of.
the building.” »

‘ Some of the most prominent features of the unit are
the voice projection boxes which are embedded in the
walls which border the water. “I’ll be able to talk to my
swimmers underwater and tell’ them what they’re doing
wrong,” Grady explained. “And we’ll be able to do the —
same with the gym students, and with the observation
decks we’ll be able to show them strokes.”

The pool features a series of diving boards at various
elevations, with the Olympic 10—meter diving board tower-
ing above everything. “It’s the only ofﬁcial Olympic board
of that height indoors in this country,” Grady said, “and
guys from all over the country are going to want to come
here to practice for the Olympic Games.”

Lots of H20

The swimming area is 165’ by 75’ and it presents a mam-
moth view of water. “It holds 750.000 gallons of water,”
Grady remarked. “And our giant ﬁlters will turn it over

. every eight hours, three times a day to purify it. It will be-

come a sel.f—sufficient unit, like a private reservoir.”

' This building, which is due to be completed sometime
this summer, is not the only one to be built. “We’re going
to build another "pool soon right behind this one,” said
Grady, “for the girls. They’ll be able to use the underwater
voiceboxes to pipe music into the water so that the girls
can have water ballet.”

In addition, another building, which will -house several
gymnasiums, exercise areas, and research facilities, will
be constructed soon on the site where the varsity practice
ﬁeld now lies. But the football team certainly isn’t going
to suffer by the loss.

Athletic Director Frank Carver showed us blueprints of
an eleven million dollar building program which has been
drawn up to provide for athletic outlets. On paper there
were provisions for about four new football practice fields,
a soccer ﬁeld, a baseball ﬁeld, tennis courts and a few other
areas of recreation. \

All of these former pipe-dreams will be reality by 1964
if all goes well. “I’m even thinking seriously about having
a 155-pound‘football‘ team,”’Carver said. With this remark,
your sports editor’s face was brightened considerably.

“But that won’t be for about ﬁve years,” Carver added.

_ “And you’re overweight now.” He still didn’t dampen my

enenthusiasm for the new sports building program.

Aqllatic Cats Nip Notre Dame,
49-46 To Complete Season

By LEN BERENFIELD
William Shakespeare must have been referring to Ireland when
he wrote, “Everything I look on seemeth green.” The Panther swim-

ming» team made the Irish see red.
a 49-46 setback last Friday.

Record breaking performances
in the first two events gave the
cats an early lead and provided
the impetus to carry them on to
victory. .,

The 400 yard medley relay team
set a new record for the Rockne
Memorial Pool, swimming the dis-
tance in 4100.2, while Steve Gan-
ong set a new pool mark, and low-
ered his old University record by
finishing the 220 yard free style
in 2:11.5.

Sollinger Sets Mark

The Aquatic Cats continued to
crack records as the meet pro-
gressed as Jerry Sollinger got into
the act this time, establishing a
pool record in the 200 yard back
stroke. _ “

The Panthers actually clinched
the meet on Dennis McHugh’s
performance. Mcllugh set a
new Pitt record in winning the
200 yard breast stroke in 2:30.5.
Although Notre Dame came ‘on
to cop the last event of the day,
the 400 yard free style relay,
it was not enough, as McHugh’s
victory provided the Panthers
the Panthers with an insur-
mountable lead.

“Notre Dame has a real fine
squad,” said Pitt coach Ben Grady,
“and I was pleased with the way
our boys performed against them.”

With last Friday’s victory the
Panther swimmers closed out the
season with an 8-3 record, a
marked improvement over last
year’s edition of the Cats which
was able to post a 6-3 slate.

Coach Ben Grady will have
basically the same squad return-
ing next season, as only team cap-
tain Tony Sarsﬁeld will be lost
through graduation.

Much of Pitt’s success can be

The high scorers for Pitt were

iMust Reverse

Loss To Moore

‘Minutes after the wres-
tling team’s loss to Lehigh,

Tom Jeﬁries ‘sat head in ,

hands in the Pitt locker room,
a picture of dejection if there

ever was one.
later, after the Penn State match,
Jeffries strolled around the same

room like a king. The different at-

titudes were for good reasons.

Against Lehigh he had been the
goat. In what could have been
the clinching match for Pitt, Jef-
fries lost a seemingly insurmount-
able lead in the closing seconds.
Against Penn State‘ he scored the
decisive win against Ed Pohland
and was a hero. '

Even though Lehigh’s Chuck ‘n
Moore had beaten him 7-6, Je- 2

fries feels that “Pohland is bet-

ter than Moore.” How then does j‘

he explain the loss to Moore?
Too Nervous

“I was nervous against Moore.
So much depended on the out-
come of that match that I was
afraid to try any of my stuff for
fear I’d get myself into trouble.
The way things turned -out I still
did anyhow.

“Things will be different it
we meet in Easterns. I’m gonna

claimed.

well mannered young man and
his statement only indicates the
intense desire he has to beat
Moore and win the Eastern
crown.
Good Chance

If he does cop Eastern honors
two experts will look good. Coach
Rex Peery, although he did not

_ win, said, “I think Tom has a good
, chance as anybody to win East-
erns.”

'l‘om’s other booster is the

Amateur Wrestling News, which '

placed him on their third team
All-American squad, ahead of
all other Eastern 191 Dounders.

If Jeffries does win the Eastern
crown he will become the second

Pitt wrestler to win the 191 pound
title. The other was Tom Hall in
1960. Most of the Panther’s title
winners have come in the lower‘
weights. ’
Peery feels that the thing that
makes Jeffries such a standout is
his wrestling ability, “A lot of the
big boys have to depend on their
strength. to get by, but Tom uses
a lot of know how on the mat. He
only has average‘ strength, but
makes up for it with his ability.”
Pohland Strong

Jeffries believes that his chief
stumbling block to the Eastern
title is Pohland. “Ed is a pal
strong boy. I ought to know, He
pinned me in high school. He and
Jaklich (A1) of Northwestern are
the two best wrestlers: I’ve faced

Yes, there is Moore and there

will be others, but Jeﬁries, as
Peery said, “has the ability.” If
he uses It like he did against
Pohland and not like _he did

THE VGRASS IS ALWAYS GOLDER

The academic world, as we all know, is loaded with dignity and
ethics, with lofty means and exalted ends, with truth and beauty.
In such 3 world a. heinous thing like faculty raiding ——colleges en-
ticing teacliers away from other collcgcs—-is not even tbinka.bl.e.

However, if the dean of one college happens —-— purely by
chance, mind you —~t-0 run into a professor from another college,
and the professor happens to remark—- just in passing, mind you

—-that he is discontented with ‘his present position, why, vvliat-‘s .

wrong with the dean making the professor an offer? Like the
other a.fte.rnoon, for instance, Dean Sigafoos of Gransmire
Polytct:-.l.i, ﬁnding himself in need of a refreshing cup of oolong,
dropped in quite by chance at the Discontented Professors
Exchange where he discovered Professor Stuneros from the
English Department of Kroveny A and M sitting over a pot of
lapsang soochong and shrieking “I Hate Kroveny A and MI’?
Surely there was nothing improper in the dean saying to the
professor, "Leander, perhaps you’d like to come over to us. I
think you’ll find our shop A—OK._”

(It should be noted here that all English professors are named
Leander, just as all psychics professors are named Fred. All
sociology professors are, of course, named Myron, all veterinary
medicine professors are named Rover, and all German professors
are named Hansel and Gretel. All deans, are, of course, named

* Attila.)

But I digress. Leander, the professor, has just been offered A
job by Attila, the dean, and he replies, “'I‘l\a.nk you, but I
don’t think so.” ,

“And I don't blame you,” says Attila, stoutly. "I under-
stand Kroveny has a ﬁne little library.”

“Well, it’s not too bad,” says Leander. “We have 28.volumes
in all, including a mint copy of N (mcy Drew, Girl Detective’!

formulate conservative organiza-

alliance. -

The Society for Conservative

A spokesman for the group" said
that theirs is not an action or-

Conservative action is taken care
of by the Young Americans for
