It's Wait and See for Appropriations

LCB Appeals Decisi

By»MARY KANE

Pitt News Staff Writer

Gov. Dick Thornburgh is adop-
ting a “wait and see” attitude

toward a. possible slash in ap-L

propriations for_ state-related
universities because of uncertainty
about the outcome of an appeal ﬁl-
ed Friday by the Liquor Control
Board, according to Thornburgh
budget spokesman Nick
DeBenedictus. The LCB appealed
a Commonwealth Court ruling that
new LCB price changes were illegal-
ly adopted and price rollbacks
would have to take effect.

Without the additional revenues
the ‘price changes would generate,
Thornburgh may have to cut, or
“abate,” 10 percent of the $335

million state appropriations ear-
marked for state-related univer-
sities. . ‘ _
“That (the LCB revenue) is the
majority of the funds we were going
to use to pay the deﬁcit for the
state-re1ateds,” DeBenedictus said.
An unanticipated $33 million
budget shortfall "caused Thorn-
burgh to call for.the abatement,
which is scheduled for Oct. 1. The

State Legislature had previously ap- .
proved a budgetof approximately _

$7l.O69 million for Pitt.

The budget deficit was created, in
part, by the LCB’s reneging this
summer on a_ commitment to pro-
vide $26 million through price in-
creases or aten-cent-a bottle sur-

charge, and the failure of the

General Assembly to pass a
revenue-raising bill through increas-
ed licensing fees.

However, the LCB’s new ‘pricing
policy, which increases the price of
liquor or .wine_ items costing less
than $6.50 and decreases the prices
of top—shelf merchandise, was
adopted Sept; 17 by the LCB as a
method of fulﬁlling its commitment
to the state, according to
DeBenedictus. « '

“The LCB did. it (increased

prices) and“lived up to their com- »

mitment,” DeBenedictus. said.
“But a judge has said they didn’t do

‘it properly." The LCB has ﬁled an

appeal thinking they did do it pro-
perly and, therefore, imtil we know
about that, we don’t know if the

WIRE SERVICE

price increases are going to hold or
not. . j
“The only thing we can do now is
that, finally, after he (LCB chair-
man Daniel Pennick) did live‘ up to
his commitment, although not
through the ten cent idea, now we
just have to wait and see what hap-
pens.

“Therein lies the fate of the. state-
relateds, ” DeBenedictus added.

DeBenedictus also commented
on Senate bill 1536, which repeals

funds already appropriated for Pitt.

“It’s a budgetary thing,”
DeBenedictus said, “What we’re
doing is canceling the $72 million
that you (Pitt) had received,
because it was abated, and we’re
reinstating the full amount.

on; Abatement a Possibility

“I’ll tell you why we did it _that
way.) The colleges were $33 million
short. If we just tried to put in a bill
for that $33 million, there was a
definite fear that some legislators
who didn’t have the interests of the
colleges in mind, might want to use
the money elsewhere. .

“So what we did is, we repealed
the amounts, the old amounts‘. and

now are reappropriating the full .

amounts for the colleges.”

Pitt’s Public and Governmental
Relations (PGR) chairman Ellis
Cannon said the bill comes up for a
vote in the Senate on Monday and
the House on Wednesday, CanQn_
added PGR will be travelling to

Harrisburg on Tuesday to lobby for _

the bill.

 

Mondaleis  :
Campaigrs    
‘In Oakland

By NICK ARNETT
Pitt News Staff Writer

Vice-President Walter Mondale’s‘
son, Ted, was in Oakland over the
weekend “to try and drum up some
support for the President.” .Mon-
dale’s visit to Pitt was one of many
trips by him to college campuses in ‘
behalf of the Carter/ Mondale cam-
paign. .

_ Ted Mondale" is a 22-year-old
political science major at the
University of Minnesota, who has
taken a semester off to campaign
% full-time. He spent Saturday shak-
ing hands at the Pitt—Temple foot-

. ball game, meeting reporters in the .
lower lounge of the Student Union,
and attending democratic fund-

. raisers in the area.

He said his usual style of cam— _
paigning is to “sit down informally I
with ﬁftyito sixty students and give
them a five-minute talk about what
we've done, then sit down and ' .
answer questions.” _ ~ ‘E4

Mondale said his primary goalis ‘
to persuade Carter/Mondale sup-
porters to register and vote. s

“The main thing is to get college

_students to vote. It's kind of em- '

' barrassing when after all the noise
we make, ‘we want this, we-want
that,’ then when it comes time to
vote, ‘we stay home. We feel that if
we can get our voters registered in
Pittsburgh and in Pennsylvania that

Spy ro Gyro

By BONNIE THOMPSON

A Spyro Gyra concert, a visit
from Steeler Lynn Swann, and per-
formances by mimes and illusionists

are planned for Homecoming 80,’

which will be held October 13-18,
according to homecoming chairman
Joyce Belich. I

Belich, a junior, has been work-
ing on Homecoming '80 since

April. She isadvised by the Assis- '

tant Director of Student Activities,
Joyce Giangarlo and program coor-
dinator Henry Morris, from the Pitt
Program Council.

“This year, Homecoming is more
organized and well-planned,”
Belich said. She credits policy and
funding changes for this. Previous-
ly the homecoming was funded by
the Student Government Board,
but this year, homecoming falls
under the special events committee
funded through the Pitt Program
Council.

By TOM LOFI'US ’

There are people who "live for the
challenge of meeting nature head to
head, tackling a ferocious river in

' only a tiny canoe, trecking miles
' -across frozen fields on a pair of

wooden skis, or exploring dark
caves with the aid of a small

' lantern.

Here at Pitt, these people are the

' Outdoors Club.

Whilemost people's interest" is

_ turning to football and politics, the

Outdoors Club is turning to rock
climbing.
“Every fall, the club offers a

course in rock climbing,” said Steve ;

Teixeira, a graduate of Pitt who

“This makes it easier because I
can work with other committees on
Pitt Program Council which will
provide a more full and balanced
week of activities,” Belich said.

Belich believes this change has
made the overall program more ef-
fective. - '

“Homecoming now has its own
office to work out of,” she said.

Belich explained the week’s
scheduled events.

Steeler Lynn, Swann kicks off the
week on Monday, October 13,
when he speaks in the Student
Union Lower Lounge. Tuesday,
Oct. 14, all non-CGS"
undergraduates with a validated ID
are encouraged to vote for a King
and Queen. The choice of can-.
didates has been selected under
refined requirements, according to
Belich. This year a different format
for the program is being used. She
said that this year instead of a
booklet, the committee opted for a
greetintz card tvne format that

returns to help instruct climbers.

“It’s a four-week course that

teaches the basics in climbing.”
Teixeira is one of several ex-

perienced climbers in the group who .

teaches the beginner how to tie the

g different kinds of knots, how to set
up a climb, and the proper way to .

rappel.

The course is divided into four
outings (two weeks at Coopers
Rocks, one week at,White Rocks,
and one-week at Seneca Rocks) and
gives the student a chance to pick
up the climbing techniques quickly,
but Teixeira assures that safety is
the club’s main concern.

“There is practically no room for

injury. We -instruct the beginners,

opens out into a poster com-
memorating Homecoming 1980
which can be a keepsake.

Tuesday night mime Trent

Arteberry, who has performed
throughout the United States with
such celebrities as Buddy Rich, Billy
Preston, and the Kinks will perform
in David Lawrence Hall at 8 pm.
Tickets are free to undergraduate
students with valid ID; all others
pay $1.00 admission.
- “One measure of Homecoming
1980's success will be determined by‘
student participation,” Belich said.
She added the committee hopes to
break last year's blood drive tur-
nout and to bring in 120 units or
more of blood. The drive will be
held from 11-5 in the S.U. Ballroom
on Wednesday, Oct. 15.

1976 Pitt football highlights and

‘illusionist Aundry Kole (who is

sponsored by Campus Crusade),
provide the evening’s entertain-
ment. Also that night, if you wear a
Pitt T-shirt to show your spirit,
you'll get happy hour prices _on

on rocks that are only a couple of
feet from the ground. Before the

. .climber attacks the more difficult

Seneca~ Rocks, he has the basics
mastered.” ' ’ .
The trip to_Seneca Rocks in West
Virginia is the last leg of the course
which the Outdoors Club offers to

-the student at no cost.

“The allocations that we receive
from the student government‘ allow
the club to buy its own
equipment,” said Rick Buffalini,-

the president of the club. “Thus we

are able to offer an opportunity to

the student who enjoys the out-

doors, but who could never afford

the expensive equipment.” ‘
Buffalini‘ has been a member of

the group for three years, and he

Although Coopers Rocks is
dwarfed to the mountain ranges of

taken.” He strongly urges the Pitt

student to take advantage of the ,

rock climbing course.

Exams, 1 Traffic, Adiusﬂng Lead to 'Pih‘ Student Syndrome’

By PAM SHEER

From the first frightening
freshmen days adjusting to college
life, to the last, anxious senior hour
waiting for acceptance to grad
school, the average Pitt student en-
counters a multitude of stressful
situations during his academic
career.

We know all too well the dreaded
migraines, backaches, nausea, and
insomnia which afﬂict the hard
working student as he fights his way
through city traffic, struggles to
stay awake during class, and then
tortures himself by pulling an “all

nighter” in order to cram for»

tomorrow's exam.

But, what many people don’t \

know is that these symptoms,
typically classiﬁed as the “Pitt Stu-
dent Syndrome” are often genuine
indicators that a person is undergo-
ing a serious stress problem, one
that could be extremely dangerous
to his future health if not reduced.
The new Stress Management Pro-
gram, currently being conducted at
the Wellness Resource Center

‘ located in Holland South, is design-

ed to help students reduce the
everyday anxieties which cause
physical and‘ psychological discom-
fort, according to Pitt Health

‘ Educator Bob LaCivita.

“Anything that takes you out of

. normal homeostasis can be defined

as stress,” LaCivita said.

The stressor is the item that pro-
vokes the stressful situation and ac-
cording to LaCivita, it can be either
negative or positive. In either situa-
tion, the ‘body is altered from a
relaxed to a tense state.

For example, if a student enters a
room in which he is about to take a
test he knows he isn't prepared for,
his heart may start beating faster,
his blood pressure will rise, and he
may feel a loss of appetite. These
are a few of the natural body
responses common to most people-
under a stressful situation, accor-
ding to LaCivita. However, he said
that if that same person should win
the lottery the exact same
physiological alterations would take
place.

“The difference is,” LaCivita

pointed out, “in a positive stress
situation, the ettects are ﬂeeting.
After the initial encounter with the
stressor, the body returns to nor-
mal, relaxed state. However, with a
negative stressor, the stress
response lingers and it takes longer
for the body to acheve homeostasis
again. Everytime there after the
person is reminded of the negative
event, his body may again be
altered to the stress response.”

LaCivita said the immulogical
system, which is responsible for
preventing illness, is eventually
broken down by the stress, and this
causes headaches, nausea, and
other discomforts.

“In the Stress Management Pro-
gram, we are trying to teach people
how to relax,” LaCivita said.
“Most people don’t even realize
they are under stress, because. they
are never relaxed——they don’t know
how to. This is when stress can be

dangerous.” _

The program, which is available
at no cost to all Pitt students, as
well as faculty, emphasizes
minimizing the intensity of the
Stress response, through several
strategies including deep breathing,

progressive muscle relaxation and
temperature changing. LaCivita
said that if a person goes to the

Wellness Resource Center thinking
' he may be a candidate for the pro-

gram, he will be given a self evalua-
tion of his body response to stress,
which will indicate if there is, in-
deed, the possibility of over reac-
tion from stress. »

At that point, the person will
become involved in a program in-
volving various relaxation techni-
ques, LaCivita explained. The stu-
dent will meet once a week with a
trainer and learn different
breathing techniques and relaxation
exercises that he must practice dur-

“'_I‘hat_ would involve changing a
person’s whole personality, which is
quite hard to do, sometimes,” com-
mented LaCivita.

Contrary to other relaxation pro-
grams, there is no yoga or medita-
tion involved in this method, in
order to eliminate any religious im-
plications, LaCivita said.

Sessions will be onan individual
basis or by group, according to
LaCivita, who will be conducting
group sessions in the dorms.

LaCivita has held the position of
Health Educator at Pitt for the past
three years. Prior to this, he was a
counselor for drug and alcohol

The Stress Management Program
is LaCivita’s original method and is_
new to Pitt this year. He said he
believed there was a definite need
for such a program since many of
the students’ illnesses seem to stem

from a stress problem.

LaCivita added that although
college students everywhere must
endure the competition and
workload that academics involves,
Pitt students have the extra burden
of dealing with the city noise, traf-
tie,‘ and pollution that can add
heavily to the stress problem. a

“What most people don’t realize
is that stress can be a very harmful

thing,” LaCivita said. “There is a ~ I

The Stress Management Program
also involves such areas as learning
how to manage time, plan goals,
and change personal perceptions of
an event, but these’ items are not
emphasized, according to LaCivita.

_preparedness which costs a limited
-amount of money and would help

us in a time of crisis.” Mondale ad-
ded that he supports the draft as a
military deterrent also.

Questioned about the ability of
the volunteer army to defend the
country, Mondale said the ad-
ministration is working to make it
more attractive. “We’ve just
okayed an 11 percent pay raise for
military personnel. I think that will
help.”

Mondale said the administration
has a good record of aiding higher
education. “We have been in
strong support of all financial sup-
port for education,” he said. In
regard. to the recent Congressional
defeat of an education aid bill, he
said: “In the Senate there is a very
conservative mood. Many con-
gressmen want to cut the broad-
range programs that don't affect
them. We've increased federal fun-
ding to education across a broad
spectrum by 60 percent in the last
three-and-a-half years.” _ _

Mondale readily admits that he

gets tired of some issues. “All I've
talked about for the last‘ two weeks
is debate, debate. I’m sick of it. I
think our position’s been clear.”

BY SAUL MARKOWITZ

The School of Health Related
Professions held its second annual
application skills seminar on Satur-
day, with attendance between
90-100 students.

The idea for such a seminar was
conceived by Dr. Shirely Atkins.

“There needed to be a way
students could gain more informa-
tion. These ﬁelds are very com-

‘ petitive,” she said.

The students who attend the skills
seminar are interested in fields of-
fered at AHRP, Atkins explained.

They include Physical Therapy,
Child Care and Development and
Medical Technology.

During the day, skits presenting
the proper way to use an interview
to one’s advantage were presented.
Other activities included a tour of
the Learning Resource Center.

Atkins said that a student’s QPA
is important, but other things can
be done to help a student sell
him/herself in the health field. For
this reason, much emphasis is given
toward the student’s personnal
statement.

“It is a statement that they are
asked for in their application, so it’s

Application Skills Emphasized at Health

supposed to really focus in on how
they developed to this point profes-
sionally,” she said. “Often it may
focus on a lot of other things that
don’t tell us a lot about what they
consider their potential for the field
and their potential for succesful stu-
dying in this school.”

These same potentials are~essen-
tial characteristics in recommenda-

tion letters. Atkins felt that these
letters which are received about an
applicant should also reflect their
academic ability.

Letters from ministers, priests or
rabbis are not accepted by Atkins,
because they don’t describe the
academic abilities of the student.
“It doesn’t help much if I know
that the person is known as a good

In terms of priority, the School
of Health Related Professions
prefer letters from professors
stating the abilities of a student.

“The Health profession is very
liable and greatly in demand. The

potential for employment plus the ~

potential for serving the community
looms very large,” said Atkins. ‘

More Funding Now Available to Scientists

By PATRICK KEENAN

Exceptional Pitt scientists will be
eligible for increased funds and‘ex-
tensive use of federal research
laboratories to study problems not
thoroughly researched in the past.

Associateships are being offered
by the National Research Council, a
branch of the National Academy of
Sciences and the national Academy
of Engineering.

Dr. J.C. McKee, director of the
council’s 1981 research
associateship program was en-
thusiastic about the possibilities

open to _the postdoctorate scientist_

who succeeds in “winning” the
award.

“The opportunities open to the
young scientist are exciting; besides
gaining necessary postdoctorage ex-
perience, a young engineer who is in

such as the tilt wing design in air-
craft that won't be commonplace

McKee said there would be over
400 associateships awarded to scien-
tists. in chemistry, engineering and
mathematics, and in the earth, en-
vironmental, physical, space and
life sciences. '

The associateships are funded by
the 16 federal institutions across the
nation that receive the scientists.

McKee added.

McKee warned that the one year
associateships should not be
mistaken for fellowships; all‘“ap-
plicants must already have their
degree. The positions are also open
to senior investigators and recent
Ph.D.’s Both will receive sizeable
stipends. _

“The young scientist can be on
the ground floor—these
laboratories are where the most ad-
vanced research is taking place.
This is a tremendous» atmosphere,”
McKee said‘. _

The applications for the
associateship must be sent to the
Research Council no later than
January 15, 1981. To receive addi-
tional infonnation from the Coun-

Opinion
    Evaluation-
,   At All Levels

L

Throughout our lives we face evaluations.

From kindergarten to college and in the careers that
follow our years in academia, we have and always will be
the subject of constant criticism, comparison and testing.

While most‘ dread evaluation, it is a necessary evil--to
realize one’s own weaknesses, to improve one’s own perfor-
mance, and to measure one’s own productivity. ‘

In school those unable to pass tests are not promoted to
the next grade. In the working world, failure to measure up
to expected standards canmean termination.

University administrators may soon face an_all new type
of evaluation.
A proposal being drafted by a University Senate Faculty

- Assembly joint subcommittee recommends that certain

University Administrators be the targets of periodic evalua-
tion by a specially appointed review cornmittee.

Such a committee would be one “acceptable to all
constituencies--faculty, students, community, the
chancellor, the board of trustees, alumni, and community
and lending organizations,” according to Richard Pratt,
chairman of the subcommittee. ‘

Those administrators subject tolappraisal, would be the L

Provost, the vice chancellor of Health Sciences, and the
deans of schools within the University, e.g. College of Arts
and Sciences, School of Education, School of Engineering.

Such in-house evaluations are not, by any means, new to
institutions of higher learning. Administrative evaluations
are currently being conducted. by colleges and universities
across the nation. ‘ - . ‘

- Eh: iﬂttt Nana
rage 6——Monday, September 29, 1930

Questions raised at last week's University Senate meeting
suggest that such evaluations might very well be a “waste of
energy.” .

It seems only reasonable that a ' ° 'strators, being _falli-
ble humans, should be subject to criticism, -measurement
and’ if necessary, termination if . they. are not rendoring
essential services to students, They, like the rest of us, can

' falter from time to time.

Lofty adrninstrative positions, years of education, and
experience in a field does not exclude a person from
benefiting from an occasional dose of healthy criticism.

Those who are doing their job to the best of their ability
should possess no fears of evaluation. Those who aren’t,
well... ~ — I

The bottom line here is that no person regardless of age,
education, or a position within a heirarchy should be im-
mune from education. We, as students, are evaluated each
and every day by our professors. Faculty members, are, in
turn, evaluated by their students each term via the
Undergraduate Academic Review. It seems reasonable that
administrative evaluations would be the logical step to
assuring quality not only at the bottom and middle, but
also at thetop of Pitt’s educational ladder.

Letters

Pitt Should Become Public Institution

fro the Editor:

Thank‘ you for your letter with
regard to appropriations for state-
related institutions. You may be in-
terested in knowing that I have con-
sistently supported appropriations
for state-related universities, and I
expect to continue _to do so.

Your questions may be more ap-
.propriately addressed to the issue of
funding non-preferred items. In the
present impasse, the governor relied
upon imposition of fees an increase
in liquor prices to balance the
budget. With regard tothe fees, the
House was asked to provide carte
blanche power to the executive.
Only a hand full of House members
were willing to grant these broad
powers to the governor. With
regard to the increase in liquor

prices, the House. has no control
over these matters.

You may find it useful to recall ‘
that when the Commonwealth first

provided funds to the University of
Pittsburgh, it was simply to tide
them over a rough spot. ‘ The rough
spot has not only continued but
enlarged to the point where we are
making armual appropriations on
the order of $80 million a year.

I believe Pitt and the other state-
related schools should decide if they
want to be public or private institu-
tions. At the present, the schools
are private when they’ want
legislative appropriations.

Of course, it’ would be to the
University's long-term advantage to
become a public institution since
the .Commonwealth’s first respon-
sibility is to public higher educa-
tion. A

reached, should be included.

To the Editor:

_.The Pitt Professional Union
has expressed its concern about
the possible closing of the
University Women’s Center in
the following letter to the
Chancellor: _ -
Dear Chancellor Posvar: A

The announcement. that the

L ’ Women’s Center may lose its finan-

cial support from the University of
Pittsburgh at the end of this year
has distressed many faculty
members. We are writing to express
our-sense of how important a place
the Center occupies in the lives of
numerous students. .

In a time when demographic
changes lead us to expect declining
avolhsents among the traditional,

fresh-out-of-high-school young
men and women who have compos-
ed our student body in the past,’
allowing the Women’s Center to
languish for lack of support seems
short sighted. Among the popula-
tion at large, older women return-
ing to school constitute a growing
pool of potential students. The
Women’s Center has provided emo-
tional, academic, and practical sup-
port for such women in the past and
will undoubtedly enlarge its role as
more women return to higher
education. In helping these women
feel comfortable in aworld that still
defines ~itself mainly as a place
where recent high school graduates
continue their education, the
Center serves a real need at the

university.

Editors note: The Pitt News has
sent letters to the members of
Pennsylvania’s General Assem-
bly asking them to write a letter
for publication on the subject of
appropriations. Due to the_over- ’
whelming amount of responses '
we have received, The Pitt News
regrets we are unable to print all
' of the letters. '

Although I am a faculty member
and not a member of the student
body,I read your paper all the time
and would like to express an opi-

‘ nion.

In reading “A Review of Pitt’s
New Visitation Policy,” I cannot
understand the students outlook on

this new policy. They say that they .
v feel that they are being told what to

FocuIiy.Membiers Concerned About Closing

The very existence of such a
center suggests to all students and
faculty that the university is respon-
sive to women’s particular needs. In
addition, the Center’s newsletter,
Synthesis, has linked faculty
members at the university _with
other college faculties in the area
and with people in the community.

We ask you to reexamine this
decision. For a relatively small sum
of money, the Women’s Center per-
forms an essential task which will
become more, not less, important in
the immediate future. If we want to
attract and keep women students,
the Women’s Center should be a
continuing part of the services w
offer them. -

do or how to run their lives, and yet
they want to be protected from the
likes of. Sidney Brinklev’s. ’

I just don’t understand how they
expect to be protected if nothing in
the visitation rights are changed, as
they have been. All students aren’t
going to have a rapist in their rooms

- and it is totally possible a rape may

never happen again. But it did hap-
pen and something had to be done
about it and it was. I-arn also as
sure that had nothing been done.
about this incident the students
would have complained more about
that. I think if the students would
examine the casea little closer they
would see that the University is do-
ing the right ‘thing.

I personally think that if it is so
important for a student to have
his/her girl/boyfriend to stay over-
night every night of the week, then
why don’t they get an apartment of
their own. It would be much more
convenient for the fellow ﬂoor
mates besides for themselves. I
don’t know about someone else,
but I ﬁnd it rather difficult to
prance about in my pajamas in the
morning knowing there is a strange
man prancing about too. I would
like to conclude with a pat on the
back for the Office of Resident Life

for a job well done, and I hope they *

stick to it. »

  Pitt Money
llneollected  

The proposed cut in funding of
institutions of higher education

results from the failure of one ex- .

ecutive agency to respond to re-
quests of the governor with regard
to funding the total budget for
1980-81.

I am sure that the responses to
your letter will indicate that there
are very few members, if any, who
favor cuts in spending for higher
education in our state-related in-
stitutions. However, it is necessary
to raise the money before it is
spent, and therein lies the problem.
I am confident that the issue will be
resolved in duecourse.

JEFF DUROs’Ko«
Pitt News Sports Editor

The big breeze that blew through
Pittsburgh Saturday afternoon was
no wind, but a collective sigh of
relief from the Panther football
team and 47,071 fans who saw
everything finally fall into place for
Pitt as the Panthers downed Temple
36-2.

Almost everything jelled into
place, that is. There were a few
anxious moments when quarter-
back Dan Marino went out in the
second quarter with an unexplained
injury. It turned out to be a slighty
bruised knee and Marino will be
ready to play Saturday against
Maryland.

“I was running with the ball and
twisted my knee,” said Marino. "If
it would have been necessary for me
to play in the second half, I could
have.”

Though Marino played for little
more than one quarter, he still
managed to complete nine of 15
passes for 150 yards and three
touchdowns. _ ,

The game started off in a manner
which Pitt fans were unhappy to
see. After winning the toss, the
Panthers electedto receive. After
gaining only two yards in three
plays, Pitt had to punt- The snap
from Jim Sweeney sailed over the
head of punter Dave Heppler who
downed the ball in the end zone"

Lonnie Davis for a two-point safe-
ty. Only 59’ seconds had ticked off
the clock and it looked like another
one of those games.

“It was just one of those things
that happen,” said coach Jackie
Sherrill following the game.
Sweeney has been our long snapper
since the first day at camp. It was
just a bad break.”

On Pitt’s next drive, Marino took
charge. On a thir_d,,.ar1,<1,.f-i.ve at his
own 32, the quarterback was under

extra point and the Panthers were in
the lead for good, 7-2.

six unreturnable kick-offs of the
day, the Owls took the ball and
could mount no drive. Temple

freshman Joe McCall who took it

The Panthers went for a two-
point conversion, but Marino’s pass
intended for Artrell Hawkins was
no good and the Panthers led 13-2.

Again, Temple could mount no
significant drive and had to punt to

again and moved the team from its

day. Two plays into the second

The Pitt Panthers soundly defeated Temple on
Saturday by a score of 36-2." At last, the team which
was picked by many to win the national champion-
ship played like a champion, both offensively and
defensively. *

   
  
  
   

There had never been any question about the Pan-
ther defense, which entered the game number four in
the nation. It didn't allow any points to be scored
while holding the Owls to a meager 176 total yards.

The real pleasure of the afternoon was the Pitt of-
fense. It was without a doubt the most impressive
showing of the young season. The pollsters around
the country finally have a reason to move the sixth-
ranked Panthers (before the Temple game) up a
notch or two. Coupled with previously fourth-rated
Oklahoma's resounding defeat at the hands of Stan-
ford, the Panthers are a sure bet to re-enter the top-
five. 2

* e . ,______________________,_,

From there on it was all systems go as the Panther
attack rolled up 371 yards in total offense, just miss-
ing the 400 plateau for a second consecutive week,
101 rushing and 270 passing. Perhaps the most pleas-
ing find of the day was that of a back-up, or more ap-
propriately, two back-up quarterbacks.

When starting quarterback Dan Marino went out
of the game right before the half with a bruised knee,
sophomore Dan Daniels played extremely well for a
little over a quarter, completing 3 of 8 passes for 40
yards with no interceptions. He stepped down in
favor of senior Rick Trocano in the final quarter and
the former QB responded by completing 6 of 7 passes
for 80 yards. The only pass he_missed was turned in-
to an interception after it had been tipped in the air
by a Temple defender.

The Panthers are extremely fortunate that Marino

ds Security of Q3  

  

— "(contimnzed on page 11)

only suffered a bruised knee and not something more
serious. The good that comes out of this is the fact
that coach Jackie Sherrill has now seen both Daniels
and Trocano operate in game conditions. Daniels
had been a question mark to Panther followers as to
whether he could be a sufficient replacement for
Marino should he, heaven forbid, be lost for several
weeks. Daniels proved that he can move the team if
needed.

Rick Trocano’s quarterbacking prowess are well
known. He filled in for Matt Cavanaugh in 1977
when the senior was hurt in Pitt’s opening game. He
has been a quarterback for a good number of years.
The question was did the switch to safety erode his
QB skills. That was answered quite early by his first
completed pass.

Although Trocano admits that he now prefers
defense, playing quarterback made him “feel at
home” again. If a team is to have a shot at winning
the national title, it must possess depth. Injuries
have a way of hitting a team in bunches and crippling

the most talented ones. How comforting it is to '

know that the vital position of quarterback is well
covered. A V ‘

9series and sophmore Dan Daniels
came into the game to lead the
team. Daniels managed one first
down out of the drive but Pitt was
stalled at the Owl 48-yard line. Hep-

pler punted to the Temple one ,

where the ball was downed.

With a fourth-and-five play from
their own six-yard line, the Owls
punted to Tom Flynn who took the
ball at the Temple 33 and fumbled.
Temple recovered the ball but turn-
ed it right back over to Pitt two
plays later. Terry White jumped on

33 Brian Slade fumble and Pitt took
over at the Temple 35-yard line.

Not able to move the ball, Trout
came in and kicked a 43-yard field
goal to put the Panthers on the
board once again. He kicked
another three-pointer at the end of
the half to put Pitt up‘ 26-2 at
halftime. ‘

At the start of the second half,
Temple began its best drive of the
day, moving from its own 20-yard
line to Pitt’s 24. With a fourth and
eight from there, Owl quarterback
Tink Murphy fumbled the snap and
fell on the ball, thus Pitt took over
control of the ball. ‘

Daniels then took the game into
his hands in what turned out to be a
banner day for Pitt quarterbacks.
On the second play of thedrive, he
threw complete to Collins who cut
across the middle for 17 yards and a
first down. In the same drive, with
a third and seven at the Pitt 48,
Daniels threw to Mike Dombrowski
for a 14-yard gain and another first

 

M‘

- down. When the drive stalled at the

Temple 32, Trout came in to boot
yet another ﬁeld goal, this one for
49 yards. Pitt was up 29-2, and the
third quarter ended with that score.

With a second and one, Trocano-
handed off to McCall who found
his way around the right end,
rambling for 19 yards. On the next
play, Trocano again passed com-
plete to Dawkins, this time for 17
yards, then to John Brown for
seven. This set up the final Pitt
score. With a second-and-goal
from the three, Trocano handed off
to McMillan who took the ballover
the left side and into the end zone
for a three-yard touchdown. Trout
kicked the extra point and Pitt took
its final score lead of 36-2.

Sherrill was pleased with the play
of all three quarterbacks. Daniels
was three of eight for for 40 yards
while Trocano was six of seven for
80 yards.

“Dan Daniels and Rick Trocano
did an outstanding job today,” he
said. “Our offensive people show-
ed more consistency. The receivers
were very sharp.”

Trocano washappy with his and
the team's performance, but stress-
ed that he is first a defensive player. i

“It seemed like old times playing
quarterback,” said Trocano. .“I
enjoy playing quarterback--but I
also love playing safety. Even

though I have been playing safety‘, -
we’ve tried to keep the quarterback-
ing skills sharp. ' I ‘

you’re up by three touchdowns,”

them some consideration,” he
answered. “Two points is a hell of
a lot better than nine points. Their
(the team’s) goal is to be rated-
ranked.”

Did the first team on defense ask
to go into the game? .

“Sure they did,” said Sherrill.

Temple coach Wayne Hardin was
impressed with Pitt and especially
Pitt’s defense. I

 think Pittsburgh has a fine
football team; I picked them as
number one before the season and I
didn’t’see anything today to change
my mind,” he said. “Their
defense—-whew!-—is devestating...
it’s the best I've. ever seen.”

Hardin was also impressed by the
play of Hugh Green and Trocano.

“Some people might say ‘Why
run at”Yii'rrf?‘“Why don't you"i‘iin
away from him?’--at least we get to
see him this way,” -he said. “I was
really impressed with Trocano, that
he’d be able to play both ways. It
was like he didn't have to be a hero-
he was interested in doing anything
fni: the team t0 Win."

and Joe McCall, were instrumental
in Pitt’s best offensive effort to
date; a 36-2 whitewashing of Tem-
ple. Collins, running back, turned
flanker, and McCall, running back,
are both newcomers who were not
expected to contribute this early in
the season. i

However, events have dictated
differently. In Pitt’s opening game
win against Boston College,
flankers Barry Compton and Larry
Sims went down with season-ending
injuries. The vacated position had
to be filled with a player who could
combine the hands of a receiver and
the moves of a running back. In
stepped Dwight Collins, a highly
recruited running back from Beaver
Falls. Collins, a gifted athlete, was
given the job and immediately
began to provide dividends.

In his first start against Kansas,
Collins made a spectacular 47-yard
grab, and the offense rolled for
over 400 total yards.

The Kansas game was the debut
of yet another freshman, McCall.
McCall, from Miami, led all rushers
that game with 71 yards. McCall’s
insertion into the lineup was
necessitated when both Rooster
Jones and Artrell Hawkins and the

entire running game was not pro-

ducing yardage consistently.

If the Kansas game was the
debut, then the Temple ‘game was
the encore. Playing before the
home fans for the first time, both
freshman contributed to Pitt’s
romp.

. Collins caught three passes, two
of which set up scores. Two of the
catches by the new flanker were
made when Collins had to leap high
in the air and snatch them from the
hands of Temple defenders. He
also ran two reserves for nine and
seven yards respectivelv.

I McCall did not run for the yar-
dage that he did against Kansas but
he did catch a touchdown pass and
displayed his quickness and speed
with several quick seven yard bursts
up the middle.

Collins spoke _of' ‘the ' sudden
resurgence of the offense and com-
mented what had to be done for the

Booters Remain Tough, Beat Mercyhurst 5-2

By ANNA ARLOTIA

Pitt News Sports Writer

The Panther soccer team
destroyed the high hopes and expec-
tations of Division One opponent
Mercyhurst last Saturday as they
glided by the Lakers in a 5-2 vic-
tory. The win was the second con-
secutive and brings Pitt’s record to
4-2. The trouncing of the Lakers
was also the first victory that the
Panthers have had on the road this
season.

It took a little over one minute
for the Panthers to gain the lead
that they would never relinquish the
entire afternoon. With a mere 1:30
gone in the game, junior center for-
ward Bob Hughes took a throw in
from teammate Eric Tiedtke and
headed the ball into the net for his
first of two goals.

By The Associated Press

STATE COLLEGE, Pa.—Led
by workhorse Jarvis Redwine and
quarterback Jeff Quinn, unbeaten
and third-ranked Nebraska-—the
nation’s top offensive team—rolled
up 445 yards against Penn State.

On defense, the Cornhuskers
forced seven turnovers, two of
which led to first half touchdowns.
They also sacked Penn State
quarterbacks nine times for 89
yards in losses and yielded just 156
yards.

But Nebraska’s knockout punch
in Saturday’s 21-7 victory over
llth-ranked Penn State came on a
74-yard, 13-play drive in the third
period. - ‘

“The key thing was the second
half. That was a really big drive for
us,” said Nebraska Coach Tom
Osborne, whose team is now 3-0.
“We stopped ourselves so many
times with penalties. We didn’t ex-
ecute as well as we can. We got
some turnovers or it would have
been a real tough ball game.”

Quinn riddled Penn State’s
defense with a short passing game,
completing 12 of 17 passes for 158
yards. On the key drive, he was
three for three for 30 yards.

And Redwine, the nation’s
leading rusher who shredded the
Lion defense for 189 yards on 34

Ironically, a replica of that first
goal appeared 17 minutes later only
this time it was Jim Hackworth who
threw in the ball to Hughes who
eagerly awaited in front of the goal.
Hughes jumped high and again
placed a picture perfect ball past the
Mercyhurst goalkeeper. It was the
big fullback, Hackworth’s second
assist of the year. ’

“The key to winning today was
starting out well,” said Al
Adelmann. “Much of the credit to
starting us off should be given to
Bob Hughes. He outheaded half of
their team to score those first two
goals.” - ‘

Hughes did play an excellent
game throughout the entire after-
noon. It displayed both an offen-
sive and defensive effort. The same
was true for midfielder Danny

carries, dove over from a yard out
for his second touchdown of the
day.

“We just decided to go down the
ﬁeld and score. We were stopping
ourselves.. When we’re on, we can
move the ball against anybody in
the country,” said, Quinn.

“As long as you have people out
in front blocking, you can almost
do anything you want,” said Red-
wine, whose performance was the
third best ever by arunning back
against Penn State.

For "Lion Coach Joe Paterno, the
sight of seeing his team self-destruct
was frustrating. 1'

“They didn’t wear us down. We
just kept giving them the football,”
said Paterno, whose team slipped to

-- 2-1.

“We were beat by an awfully
. good football team. We have
nothing to be ashamed of. I think
we showed some things that will
make us better,” he added. ‘
Nebraska forged a 14-0 lead,
thanks to Penn State’s generosity.
Starting quarterback Jeff Hostetler
fumbled a snap at his own 30 in the
first period, and Quinn scored from
less than a yard out four plays later.
In the second period, Nebraska
defensive back Sammy Sims picked
off a Todd Blackledge pass that
ricocheted off the hands _of tight
end Brad Scovill. Three plays after

Hamm who had a fine day
distributing the ball and controlling
the attack of the Lakers.

“Our attacking was great all
afternoon,” said Hughes.
“Whenever I looked for a ball there
was Danny or someone always there
to give me a little tap that would
start a play moving downfield. Dis-
tribution was good as was control.”

With 34:21 gone in the first half
of play the Panthers were again on
the scoreboard with a goal by
freshman Nick Wilson. It was the
midfielders from Bethlehem, _;Pa.
first goal for the Panthers in regula-
tion. The score was set up on a
throw in play from the left side of
the ﬁeld. This time though it was
left wing Troy Norton that assisted
on the play with his accurate place-
ment of the ball to Wilson.

Sims’ 27-yard return put the ball on
the Lion 19, Redwine ﬂew three
yards for the score.

‘,‘They didn’t make mistakes and
we did. "We can’t do that against a
team the caliber of Nebraska,” said
Blackledge, a freshman who
engineered Penn State’s lone scor-
ing drive in the second period.

“We just made too many

With a few minutes left in the
first half it looked as if the Panthers
were about to be erased. The
Lakers Ed Mascharka took a hard
shot on Panther goalkeeper Scott
Thunberg. The ball was juggled
for a split second and then hit the
crossbar only to be retrieved by
Thunberg in a successful effort to
keep the game scoreless. The half
ended with the Panthers up 3-0.

The second half opened up quite
similarly to the first with Pitt scor-
ing a quick goal from ‘Eric Tiedtke
and an assist by Bob Hughes.
Hughes headed the ball on to the
direction of Tiedtke and the
sophomore wing ranon to the ball
to put it in the net. The goal was
Tiedtke’s sixth of the season which
already puts him way ahead of his
two ﬁnishes of a year ago. With

mistakes,” said tailback Curt

_Warner, who rushed for 80 yards

and slashed three yards for Penn
State’s touchdown.

The 74-yard, eight-play scoring
drive included a 40-yard strike from
Blackledge to freshman wide
receiver Kenny Jackson.

A critical fourth quarter fumble
dashed _Penn State’s last chance to

nine games remaining in regular
season play he should have an ex-
cellent chance to challenge the Pan-
ther record of 17 goals in one
season. That record was set by Bob
Cherry in 1955.

Directly after scoring Pitt’s
fourth goal of the game, Tiedtke
was taken out of play because he
has been hampered by some nagg-
ing leg injuries. Inserted in his spot
was right wing freshman Gerry
Wasson. After being in the game
for just less than a minute, Wasson
decided that another goal should be
had from the right wing spot of the

- field. The play started when
Hughes took control of the ball and
looked for someone to pass the ball
to. He found Norton open on the
left wing. Norton then took a shot

get back in the game. The Lions
had marched 80 yards to the
Nebraska 11. But Jackson fumbled
Blackledge’s handoff on a flanker
reverse and the Cornhuskers regain-
ed command.

“It was my fault. I took my eye
off the ball. It was a different ball
game if we score,” moaned
Jackson. . .

Steelers come Back After Loss t
Bengals, Stymie Chicago Bears 38-3

By the Associated Press

Terry Bradshaw fired four
touchdown passes, three of them to
wide receiver Jim Smith, to boost
the Pittsburgh Steelers to a 38-3
rout over the Chicago Bears yester-
day in a National Football League
game.

Bradshaw, who retired to the
bench late in the third period, hit 12
of 19 passes for 217 yards as the
Steelers, 3-1, rebounded from a
two-point loss in Cincinatti.
Chicago fell to 1-3.

Smith, in his t-‘ourth..year...£mm
Michigan, had replaced John
Stallworth, who cracked a bone in
his leg two weeks ago, as a starter.

Smith’s three touchdowns, which
all came in the first half, covered
21, 29 and 23 yards. He finished
with six receptions for 131‘ yards, a
career best.

After flipping a 2-yard

, touchdown pass to tight end Bennie

Cunningham with 5:38 remaining in
the third period, Bradshaw was
relieved by backup quarterback
Cliff Stoudt.

It was the first NFL appearance
ever for Stoudt, a fouf-year veteran
from Youngstown State. Just one
week earlier, Stoudt officially
qualified for his NFL pen-
_sion—without playing a down in
regular or post-season play.

And in the fourth quarter Stoudt

touchdown pass to Franco Harris to

It was the first time since 1952
that the Steelers had five
touchdown passes in a single game.
In that contest, the Steelers beat the
New York Giants 63-7 behind four
touchdown passes by Jim Finks and
another by Gary Kerkiorian. Finks

yards in 12 attempts. .He also

With one out in the sixth, Jim
Tracy singled. The count on
Mike O’Berry went to 3-2 and,
on the next pitch by Bert
Blyleven the Pirates thought it
was strike three and Tracy was
doubled trying to steal second.

But umpire Jerry Crawford
said it was ball four, leaving the
Cubs with two on before
Kelleher tripled.

‘After Kelleher’s hit, Tanner
stormed out of the du out and

 

got‘ into an argument with

Crawford, who earlier this

season had a run-in which led to

a 15-dav suspension of Pirate in-
fielder Bill Madlock.

Milner and Parker were
ejected from the bench by first
base umpire Doug Harvey. As
Milner left he kept throwing
helmets onto the field and
Harvey kept counting as if to
mean Milner was to be fined for
each of the six helmets he heav-
ed from the dugout.

American Dance Ensemble
Sponsers Guest Instructor

By J. D. KLEINKE

Entering its fourth season, the

. American Dance Ensemble of Point '

Park College has been busying itself
with preparations, both managerial
and artistic.

As a part of upgrading its quality
of performance, Artistic Director
Nicholas Petrov turned to the exper-

' tise of the famed Russian teacher

and choreographer, Mansur
Kamaletdinov. _

I During the latter half of _
September, Kamaletdinov served as
guest instructor and coach, working
intensely with the Ensemble dancers
for their upcoming season opener,
the Graduation Ball Ballet. He also
taught some classes and oversaw the
rehearsals for the ballet.

Mansur Kamaletidov, a native
Russian, was educated in the art of
ballet -at the Leningrad School of
Ballet. In 1945 he joined the Len-
ingrad Kirov Theatre, his first
employment as a danseur, and then
went on to dance for the Tbilishi
Opera and Ballet Theatre. Later, his
interests turned, to choreography, \
and he entered the Moscow
Choreographic School.

After adding this aspect of dance
to his credentials, he entered the il-

lustrious Bolshoi Theatre and
became a master teacher and coach.
Working at Bolshoi, ' he encountered
and‘ consequently developed the
talents of many later famed dancers.
The list of these includes‘such artists
as Vasiliev, Vladimirov, and
Karleskaya as well as countless
others, all of whom are demonstrat-
able evidence of Kamaletdinov’s
ability as a balletmaster. ‘

Some of Mansur’s noteworthy
original choreography includes
Spanish Capriccio, and Don
Quichot, premiered by his own
dancers at the Bolshoi, and the
Novosibirsk, respectively, for ap-
preciative Russian audiences.

Aftr he presented his concert
piece Russian Souvenir at the
Bolshoi Theatre in 1969, he received
the title of ”Laureate.”

Since 1975 he has toured the
United States, working as a guest
teacher and choreographer for the
American Ballet Center in New

‘York City, the Joffrey Ballet, the
dance division of the Julliard
School, the ballet company of the
Metropolitan Opera, andthe
Saratoga Ballet Center in Upstate
New York. ,.

By I.D. KLEINKE

DEATHTRAP

Directed by Don Wadsworth
Written By Ira Levin
Pittsburgh Playhouse

Ira Levin's Deathtrap is in no way social-
ly significant; it is an action play not bogg-
ed down by theme.

6 Running until October, 12th at the

Playhouse on Craft Avenue, Deathtrap
was intended to entertain, and this is does
without exception. I

The play utilizes two of the most effective
elements of the ”theatre of entertainment”:
sharp, intelligent wit, and heart—stopping
surprise-scare tactics. 5

Hugh Rose, portraying a crusty
playwright suffering a twenty-year dry
spell, adds the perfect touch of sardonicism
to bring the arrogant character of Sidney
Bruhl to life. ‘_ As Bruhl attempts to remedy
his creative impotence, a complex scheme
of his slowly unfolds into a spiteful game of
duplicity and revenge. As a former student
of his, bubbling over with inspired en-

v

. thusiasm, and a neurotic psychic» become

45

 

ensnarled in his evil doings, the plot twists‘
around every corner.  - :-

Having seen _'_,Der‘zthtrapi on’ Broadway,
this reviewer's expectations may have been
somewhat inflated, but the Playhouse
Theatre -Companysproduction was con-

 

f

" W e l l- D on eC o m e cl Ly-Thriller Offers Perfect Escape

vincingly innovative enough_to' leave me
thoroughly satisfied. ’

The cast was fresh and vibrant enough to

overcome the confines of a smaller, seem- ~

ingly crowded theatre; in fact, it may have

been this constraint that made the "Thrill" _

sequences that much more powerful.

On this element of the play I would love
to elaborate, but that would spoil half the
fun of seeing Deathtrap for the first time.

‘All I will say is this: when you least ‘ex-
pect it, expect it! The forte of the play is its
"gut-.grabbers;" those sudden bursts of
unanticipated shock, that appear utterly ir-
rational and inconsistant with'the plot, but

unfold logically while the audience collects .

its wits. ,
Recognizing this as being the major
theatrical device in the Deathtrap ex-
perience, the Playhouse Theatre Company
plays this to the hilt. '

With great enthusiasm, I recommend a
heavy dose of Deathtrap to the weary. Its
appeal is all-consuming, and offers the
perfect two-hour respite . from a trying
week. '

"But first, aT'word offorewarning: don't

walk into the theatre expecting enlighten-.

ment. Don't expect to be infuriated about
the grave injustices of society; that is not

Deathtrap's function. Iust plan on an even- 5'

ing of theatrical entertainment. in its purest
form. x _ ,’

“Iron Clad Agreement Opens

INTERCHANGEABLE PARTS
Directed by Geoffrey Hitch‘
Written by Chris Blaetz

Iron Clad Agreement A

A By BONNiE BLACK

'.“I1\l1'-ERCHANGEABLE PARTS or

I .WHI1‘I§lEY.- HIS MIND IN MOTION is a

most unusual theatrical experience. One
has to question, though, whether a produc-
tion with no costumes, no make-up and on-
ly room lighting is deserving‘of the descrip-
tion "theatrica ." The production touts

itself as having a "minimalistic style." If we V
define minimal as the least possible, then»

this is an accurate description; for there can
be nothing lessthan no style at all.

The play itself deals with Eli Whitney in
juxtaposition with his contemporary socie-
ty. It brings him to life more than any
history book ever has. One is forced to
think of the many possible reasons the in-
ventor could have had for inventing. Many
events of his life are exposed and examined
along with some of their effects. At the
same time, the play seems to blame

Whitney for everything from slavery (or its ~

increase) with the invention of the cotton
gin, to the killing of hundreds of innocent
people in war (because he mass-produced
the muskets); he is portrayed as a man
whose primary aim was wealth and as one
who almost completely eliminated hand
crafts by the institution of his uniformity

_ system of interchangeable parts.

This story is acted by a company of ac-

.. tors called the Iron Clad Agreement. Dur-

ing many scenes, the acting so resembles
that of a high school musical that one might

find oneself looking for the PTA to be sell- I’

ing refreshments outside‘. Indeed, that
might have been an improvement. Fre-

' quently, actors who have no set to help nar- ‘
_rate their story must ("and do) create their

roles so skillfully that the audience finds
itself grateful forthe lack of design. This,
however, "was not the case in Carlow"Col-

  5 iChath“a.m’sJAn}tonian Hall  

The roles which are probably the most ill-.
defined are those played by Katherine

Ames and Doug Mertz. Each plays many .

roles, none well. Perhaps it is the number
of roles which makes it impossible for any
one to develop into anything more than a
caricature. '

The other two actors in the company are ’ ‘I I

probably the play's greatest redeeming fac-
tors. Ann Beigel is warm and alive as

everything from a rock to a rather crooked \

business partner of Whitney's to a con-
gressman. The theme which runs through
all her characters is that of doubt. She has

developed each of these roles‘ and portrays: .

them all with real understanding.

Eli_ Whitney's character is developed
perspicaciously by Larry John Meyers, who
plays only this part. He is the one who
most makes the audience realize that Eli

"Whitney was far more than just a name in la _ A
history book, but that he was a man with .

an inquisitive mind, with human needs and
desires and, ultimately, regrets. In an

’ engaging performance, Meyers shows us a
' man who wanted to improve the world, not ‘
someone who caused pain for ‘thousands of *

people. :. He alone defends Whitney's

motives and actions against a score of other

character's accusations in this play; and he
_ does this with‘ great conviction.

(At the end of the play, there was held a‘
brief discussion of some of the ideas and of

the play itself. We learned at this time that
the company had rehearsed for only two
weeks prior to opening the show. Perhaps
if Saturday night had been opening night
rather than the last night before closing,
The Iron Clad Agreement would have had a
piece more clearly developed and balanced
to give us. '
_ As- an

' improvisation, INTER-

CHANGE/iBLE' PARTS might be a‘

.’'theatrical'' discussion of several ethical
questions-a discussion which reaches no
conclusions (for there are no conclusive
answers to these questions), but which
might cause the audience to consider ideas
of which they have never thought.» As a

STORM WINDOWS
John Prine
Elektra

John Prine is something of a cult
artist,‘ having a small but fanatic
following among some people and
total anonymity among others_
Prine’s latest offering Storm Win-
dows features enough witty, original
lyrics and strong melodies that it has
all the possibilities of expanding his
audience. '

The title track is a song about a
person resigned to living on the _out-
skirts of life. I can hear, the wheels/of
the automobiles/so far way, Prine
begins. The storm window the singer
looks at life through becomes a shield
against the pain of living. When
Prine sings the chorus, Don't let your
baby down, it becomes clear the
singer's retreat is the result of a
broken relationship. Still, images and
memories filter through the window,
and at the conclusion of the song,
Prine realizes the isolation and
stagnation of his position. Storm_
windows/Gee but I'm getting

~ old/Stonn windows/Keep away the

cold. .
"Shop Talk" begins the album with
a strong honky tonk beat and funny
lyrics about a girl discussing pro-
blems with her relationship to a
restaurant full of people, Now you're
standing on a table/And we're draw-
ing a crowd, Prine sings. Other songs
include "Living in the Future," a
cynical look at progress, and "One
Red Rose," a song about leftover
memories. "One Red Rose" features
some of Prine’s best imagery. Hardly
a sound was left/From the birthday
party/ The kitchen light/Fell asleep
on the bedroom floor/'Sleepy Eyed
Boy," about the loss of innocence,

-and "I Had A Dream Last Night,"

also are strong on imagery.

But songs like "All Night Blue" and
"It's Happening to Yo‘u," have,
predictable lyrics and are the album's
weakest cuts. _

Prine recorded this albumin Mus-
cle Shoals, Alabama, and the Muscle
Shoals influence is evident in the
southem-flavored melodies. Storm
Windows is even lyrically and
musically stronger than last year's
Bruised Orange, and it seems in time
more people become aware of John
Prine.

MUSICAL SHAPES
-Carlene Carter
Warner Bros.

Along time ago, there was a type
of music called Country Rock. The
idea wa.s to blend the drive of rock
with the sincerity and folksiness of
country. Anyone who is halfway
aware knows this "goal got‘ lost in
L.A. . _

This--brings us to Carlene Carter
who may be the best thing to happen
to the music in years- What
distinguishes her from other practi-
tioners is instead of starting out as a
rocker she comes from The.Carter
Family; one of the most important
traditions in C 8: W. Period.

I his year's model (her third), in-— -

cludes such gems as an updated "Ring
Of Fire" that mixes electronic touches
with tradition. There are aggressive,
self-aware rockers like "I’m So Cool."
Most of all, there are songs like "Ap-
palachian Eyes” and "To Drunk (To
Remember)" that simply take old C 8:
W styles’ and invigorate them with
real drive. '
One of the main reasons for the ex-

What more do you want?

From the forth-coming film (Who
Films, Ltd.) about famous English
convict John McVicar, starring short-
haired Roger Daltrey, we have the in-
evitable soundtrack album. As a
record, this music holds up quite
strong without a movie in front it.
Daltrey’s ragingﬂvocals are in fine
form and of all of his previous solo
pursuits outside of The Who, this is
far and away his most inspiring and
Who-like performance. ‘

Perhaps the real star of this album
however, is producer Jeff Wayne.
Noted previously for his instrumental
interpretation - of War Of The
Worlds, Wayne has recorded and ar-
ranged McVicar in state-of-the-art
condition. This is recommended for

' hi-fi buffs as well as ’Oo aficianados.

Russ Ballard contributes ' three
tracks including the heavy metalish
single, "Free Me." Other famous
Who members also log some studio
time which gives McVicar a sound
not too unlike Who Are You.

High fidelity. V .

i \ - SCOTT MOWRY
Jethro Tull ‘
Elektra

Jethro Tull seems to have a serious
problem of form following content,
and "A" is the most recent example of
this. On the positive side, the album
has some interesting and intricate
melodies that even go so far as being
reminiscent of Stravinsky-like or-
chestration. But the lyrics and vocals
plunge "into an abyss of totalitarian
paranoia and middle class angerat

g societal restriction. The latter proves

V .-.t_o be a definite hindrance to the
former, and "A" proves to be just as

 -if not more boring that Tull’s previous
effort, Storm Watch. 

Group spokesman Ian Anderson's
ill concieved theme scheme falls in-
credibly short of his approach of
lyrical anger and outrage. He tries to
verbalize his ideas of restrictive social
structure through crass subtleties and
disjointed cliches that drain the
listemer by the second or third song.
Tull fans may find " " interesting
and entertaining, but my bet is that
they'll the barage of sameness _the
new album possesses as much if not

more than everyone else.

FLESH AND BLOOD
Roxy Music
ATCO

Not long ago; Bryan Ferry wrote a
song called "The Thrill Of It All."
With Roxy Music's seventh album,
you've got to have some doubts
whether that spirit persists.

Only on "In The Midnight Hour"
does the old "maybe campy, maybe
decadent" attitude still shine. In fact,
what you have here is downright
puritan brooding about the imper-
manance of Life's delights. .

More than anything, Flesh And
’Blood_ is like Ferry's last solo album
The Bride. Stripped Bare; another
melancholy record. If you liked Roxy
before you'll like this album. If you

try their Greatest Hits. It's more fun.

LITTLE STEVIE ORBIT
Steve Forbert
Nemperor ,
Once again, prophecy holds true. ’
What kind of music would expect
from a small-town boy fr_om
Mississippi who grew up with a pas-
sion for rock, country, pop, and "
blues, while enjoying enough per-
sonal quirks to illicit genuine social
rebellion?

A sometimes laid-back, sometimes
funky musician who travels the fr-.
inges of the avant-garde, maintaining ‘
a distinctive style of diversified .

‘ music? Exactly.

Forbert’s latest, Little Stevie Orbit .
continues his epic journey through
the annals of cold-world reality. As
with his first two albums, Orbit is in
no way profound; his lyrics are tangi-
ble descriptions of the ups (and
downs) of everyday existence,
perhaps -oversimplified, perhaps even
trite.

But his tunes are catchy, and very
pleasant to the casual ear. Like the
name he carved out for himself two
years ago,‘ Forbert’s music is varied,‘
innovative, and somewhat
rebellious. ‘

If Orbit's lyrics seem slightly off
the wall to you, don't worry, it's only

‘lo; 31571’ ‘i’rﬁag‘iiila’ti’oh.”" ‘
And now, a trilogy.

THERE ANDBACK
Jeff Beck
Epic

 

Jeff Beck, long time veteran of the
jazz/blues-rock sect has done it
again. ' There and Back has a
familiarity of style and quality that
says "That's Jeff Beck.”

Each side of this album has a plea-
sant mixture ,of intensity, ranging
from mellow to sizzling hot, both of
which allow an exhibition of a very
talented guitarist. '

There's also some good electronic
sounds to set the mood for "Star Cy-
cle", and "Space Boogie” which may
be a hint as to where ‘there’ is. There
and Back is where I hope Jeff Beck
will stay.
Quality product.

CHOICE curs ‘ 

Choice
Polydor

Choice Clones should be the title of
this band's debut album._ After listen-
ing to this album, one gets the im-
pression that one has just heard
K-tel’s "Artist's Garbage" collection.
Almost every song just happens to
imitate the style of a famous artist.
For instance, Choice's song, "I Got
My Mind On Ruby," sounds

_ shamelessly close to Billy Joel's, "All
For Leyna." Moreover, their track,
"Your Eyes,” sounds like an REO

ARE HERE
The Kings
Elektra

Just what the world needs—anOther
new band with white shirts, skinny
ties, and new wave accents.
Although The Kings Are Here is a
debut LP, these guys are semi-
superstars in Canada. In fact, they

headlined (Over established acts as ,

Elvis Costello, the B-52's, and the
Talking Heads) at last month's Heat
Wave festival in Toronto.

two hours later you're hungry and
thene’s nothing you heard that's ap-_
petizing enough to make you want to
,go back for seconds. Sure, "Swit-
ching to Glide” is a nice enough song
but THERE'S NOTHING ABOUT IT
THAT MAKES ME NOT WANT
TO TURN OFF THE STEREO. And
I can't help but think "Partyitis" is an
outtake from an old Kiss album.
Maybe we can blame Bob Ezrin for
his overproduction. Maybe we can't.

Overall, the Kings fail to connect.

THE I(ING_s

. . .a classic case of fast food rock 'n' roll.

(Continued from page 7)

Sure, it's bad enough for these guys
to sound like every popular artist and
his brother, but this band does it
poorly. Their clone-like cuts have the
Chutzpah of one of Tom Snyder's
jokes. Their only possible saving
grace, a cover of Bruce Springsteen's
classic, "For You," fails miserably

with vocals that sound like the Mor-
mon Tabernacle Choir. Choice just
doesn't make it. To say this band has
a long way to go would be silly. in
other words, choosy listeners should
not choose Choice Cuts.

Choose Another. H

The Kings are a classic case of fast

food rock and roll. You eat there and

Maybe next time. -

KamaletdinOv's work with the
American Dance Ensemble is strong
indication of the serious attempt to
upgrade the caliber of local dance.
The Ensemble, a relatively new
addition to Pittsburgh dance, has‘
reinforced public opinion that their
upcoming season will offer dance of
an even higher quality than in the
Past by sponsoring guests like Man-

sur Kamaletdinov. Knowing _that
the input of such a master of the art
has contributed to local dance, one
can not help but look forward to
the coming season with eager an-
ticipation. \
Kamaletdinov is a well—reputed ‘
innovator in the world of ballet,
and his impression should be all but
evident in the American Dance
Ensemble’s quality of performance.
