_ Dr. Cot, who was to speak at a
previous meeting but was unable to
;attend- because of illness, will pre-
sent an analysis of the recent French
government.

Prior to German occupation of
his country, Dr. Cot played an im-
portant part in French politics. He
was a member of the Chamber of
Deputies and later a French dele-
gate to various international confer-
ences. Then, successive1y,, he oc-
cupied the position of undersecre-
tary of state, minister of aviation,
-and minister of commerce. He re-
tained the commerce portfolio until
he was indicted by the present Vichy
government because of his activities
as minister of aviation.

Dr. Cot, who holds doctorate de-
gress in law and political science,
taught at the University of Rennes.

Following Dr. Cot’s address, stu-
dents will join in an informal dis-
cussion with him.

Future plans for Town meetings
include the final speeches in the

student peace oratorical contest, an '-

analysis of the draft law, and a stu-

dent-faculty symposium on various

questions.

"Fred Robie, Ecl41, has resigned as
co—chairman of Pitt Town Meetings,
it was announced today.

Robie, active on campus in vari-
ous activities as manager of Men’s
Debating association, member of the
executive committee of SFA, vice-
president of Kappa Phi Kappa, and
member of the publications board,
found that the additional work of
co-chairman of Pitt Town Meeting
required too much time. .

Esther Marcuson, C41, carries on
 the other co—chairman pending
the appointment of a successor to re-
place Robie.

Nebraska, State to Close
Panthers’ Home Season

Pittmen to Seek
Win Tomorrow

Over Huskers

"\Vit.h the bitter memory of last
year ’s heartbreaking 14-13 de-
feat at the hands or ‘Nebraska
foremost in__mind an underdog
Pitt‘ Panther isexpuected toreach
the heights in grid prestige when
it plays host to.,the mighty Corn-

huskers from the Midlands at the
Stadium tomorrow afternoon.

Lackadaisical play on the part

of the Bowser- coached eleven
last’ Saturday demonstrated conclu-
sively that the Panthers were point-
ing toward tomorrow’s contest. Cer-
tainly, much was saved by the Pitt
team.

Rated eleventh in the latest As-
sociation Press poll, Major Biff
Jones’s squad will afford the locals
as stiﬁ‘ opposition as they have
battled all year. Only the thunder-
ing Minnesota juggernaut has
downed this powerful outﬁt which
owns five straight victories over In-
diana, Kansas, Missouri, Oklahoma,
and Iowa. ’

The only basis for comparative
performances occurs in the scores
recorded by both elevens against
Missouri, their lone common oppo-
nent. Missouri suffered. its two de-
feats at the hands of the Panthers
and Huskers, losing to Pitt 19-13,
and to Nebraska, 20-7. '

Headed by a phalanx of all-star
‘backs, the Midlanders attack has
rolled up at least two touchdowns in
every encounter, except the Minne-
sota test which‘ was dropped, 13-7.
In-that titanic- struggle, the Goph-
ers had to summon all their defen-
sive strength to halt the. Huskers
on the seven and eight-yard lines
on two occasions.

It is difficult to single out any one

most valuable player on the Panther
football team begins today and will
continue through next Wednesday..
The award will be made Monday
evening,, November 25, at the
Schenley theater, whose manage-
ment is sponsoring the poll.

The ballot appears on page three
of today’s News and will be re-

sented with a silver trophy, depict-
ing a football player throwing a for-
ward pass.. The base of the trophy.

the awardee.

Presentation of the trophy will
take place on the Schenley stage
just prior to .-the ﬁnal showing for

SFA Defeats  
‘Hoeveler Bill’
By Small Vote

Election Change  
Proposal Falls

Second Time

By giving it ﬁve votes less than
the; necessary two-thirds major-
ity, the ’Student-Faculty a.ssem-
bly \Vednesday evening killed
the much-hagglcd-over “Hoevel-
or amendment” for the’ second
time in seven months. 4

The amendment, providing for
the election of the assembly’s of-
ficers by the executive committee
rather than by the entire assembly,
had previously been introduced in-
to SFA last year and voted down
at the ﬁnal meeting of the 1939-40
group.
Politics, the Issue

Intended to replace article IX,
section 1, of the present constitu-
tion, the proposed amendment,,stat-
ed: “The executive committee shall
nominate from among its member-
ship two or more candidates for
each of the offices of president, sec-
retary and treasurer, and these of-
fices shall be ﬁlled by election of
a majority of the committee. The
candidate receiving the second
highest number of votes for presi-
dent shall be vice-president.”

Purely by coincidence, although
the amendment was designed to
“take politics out of the election of
oﬁlcers,” the alignment for and
again the amendment followed
strictly the lines of political affilia-
tion. Fraternity members both spoke
and voted against the proposal,
while Independents favored it. Fac-
ulty members also backed the
amendment. -

,Chief opposition to the plan was
voiced by Gene Pyle, C41, Joe Rob-
erts, BA41, and Dave Bucnte, C41,
who held, variously, that the facul-
ty members of the executive com-
mittee would not know the candi-

dates as well as would the student -

members of the Assembly, that the
majority "should be awarded the
presidency because it is a majority,
and that having the deciding votes
taken out of the hands of the stu-
dents would be destroying demo-
cratic principles.
Faculty Knows Students »
In rebuttal, Adele Yorio, Ed41,
Dave Tucker, C41, and Fred Robie,
Ed41, contended that the faculty
knew the students muchbetter than
the students realized, that the pres-
ident should be the best person
available, regardless of majority or

minority standing.
Mr. Robert Ayers, a faculty mem-
ber on the original committee

which drew up the constitution af-
ter the demise of the old Student
council, pointed out that the faculty
check on the election of ofﬁcers
had been incorporated to prevent
the custom of fraternity deals, prev-
alent in the Student council. “With-
out that check, I feel that the prob-
lem may arise again,” he empha-
sized. ‘

SFA Presents

Concert Series

University students will have an
opportunity Wednesday to hear two
noted artists, Alton Jones, pianist
and Ezio Pinza, baritone.

Alton Jones will appear in the
SFA cor-cert hour at 1 o’clock in the
Foster Memorial. The program is to
be the first in a series sponsored by
the concert hour committee of SFA,
explained Thomas
BA42, chairman.

Free admission tickets may be ob-
tained at the ofﬁces of the dean of
women, dean of men, or deans of
the various schools.

Ezio Pinza, famed baritone of the
Metropolitan Grand Opera com-
pany, will sing in Carnegie Music
hall on the same day, in the second
program of classical music sponsor-
ed by the Art Society of Pittsburgh
this year.

Mr. Pinza is the only artist on the
concert stage of today who will
have three consecutive concerts in

this city. I-lis appearances here in
the past have excited much favora-
ble comment.

The program will consist of both
classical and lighter numbers. Fritz
Kitzinger will accompany Mr. Pinza.

. . . for beauty

Last year 137 students worked

on the Owl which featured over
2,000 pictures, 1,982 photographs
of different presons ‘in the Univer-
sity.- - ’

One and a half tons of paper were
thrown between a half ton of Owl
covers to form the 1,200 yearbooks
that were sold last year. Glue used
in the construction of the Owl to,-
taled 24 gallons and one quart.

All these statistics were revealed
by Selwyn Loeb, BA41, business
manager of the Owl who also an-

sales will be made at a meeting of
senior Owl salesmen today in the
Owl‘ofﬁr:e. 1‘ ’

“It is to the ﬁnancial advantage
of senior Owl salesmen to attend
this meeting,” asserted Loeb.

Edited by William Sheris, BA41,
the theme of the Owl is “You.”

' The Owl is published each May by
members of the senior class. Un-
derclassmen work on the yearbook,
and after three years service gold
keys are given. "

Owl editors promise a four’ hun-
dred page volume this year that will
surpass all other Owls of previous
years.

‘Unreconstructcd Rebel’ Still

Doeszft Like Roosevelt
’ S By Robert Hamil‘.-on

I am disgusted with the gentlemen of the press,
easily recognized by the dorsal ilavous stripe and hypo-
critical smile, who heartily panned Mr. Roosevelt be-

fore the recent election, but who now lick up to him.

I have especial reference to that
tough old turncoat, Hugh Johnson,
and his sickening column last Thurs-
day night in which he attempted to
crawl back into the good graces of
his old friend, “my pal, Franklin.”
Nuts.

My own personal feelings may be
prejudicing me in this, since I
thought before the election that
Roosevelt’s reelection would be an
unmitigated national calamity, and
have not changed my opinion one
whit, jot, nor tittle.

 

Hamilton

Election Doesn’t Square Things

‘ It seems’ to me, however, to borrow a phrase. that
the mere fact’ of Mr. Rooseve1t’s reelection does not
automatically whitewash the nepotism, governmental
abuse, favoritism, and corrupt politics for which his
administration is notorious. It seems to me that his
reelection makes these things a target at which every
citizen with a sense of duty should take a shot, since
Mr. Rooseve1t’s return to office in spite of these sup-
purating facts shows a dangerous softening of the
national ﬁbre.

It would be as foolish for the lamb to lie down with
the lion as for the Elephant to make peace with the
Donkey now. Not once in the last eight catastrophic
years have those who think as I do had so many on
their side. Almost half of our people are united now
against the president. That is a minority that is not so
very minor. And never before has it been so necessary
for our country to possess a militant, and I do mean
militant, minority to prevent the gentleman in the
White House from running hog wild.

Not A Southern ‘Rebel’

There will be no place in the U. S. for lukewarm
politics. in the coming administration. It is time that
the United States got rid of» men like Cotton Ed Smith,
John Nance Garner and other fools of the Solid South
who would go ﬁshing on election day rather than
vote, or retire to a ranch rather than campaign against
a group which clashed with personal ideas. The Solid
South is solid only in the head. They would rather
hang onto outworn antagonisms than stand up in the
pride of their manhood and fight for what they believe.

Theseare parlous times, and there is no place in
them for men who base their decisions on the size of
their WPA checks. There are important principles at
stake, and it is up to men to scrap for what they be-
lieve to the last atom of their energy and strength.

As a deﬁnitely unreconstructed rebel, I hope that
this great minority will take their rallying cry from
Vincent Sheean—Not Peace, but a Sword.

  In the Clouds
/'\ /"'~\ /'\ /“‘\

I wish I had been elected Presi-
dent.

I don’t even want to be God, I
don_’t think I’d know what to do
with it.

I know what I’d do. First, I’d
convert all the religious demagogues
to Democracy. Then I’d

Then you’d convert all the Demo-
crats into» demigods.

Two demigods are better than
one God. But after that I’d let
these new Democrats take out the
stained-glass windows and letisom.-e
light in. After that I.’d open all the
factories.

And after you opened all the fac-
tclries and gave everyone food, cloth-
ing, shelter, and Fords, someone
should get a toothache. He would
want to know the Why of it. You
wouldn’t know so you’d have to put
the stained glass windows in again.

But you see we already have dent-
ists. _Even the dentists would have
more work. More people would
learn to "be dentists. . More Univer-
sities would be built to educate
more dentists.

And the dentists would cut their
ﬁngers and want to know the Why
of that.

We’ve got doctors, and we could
build more hospitals and anyway
dentists are old enough not to cut
their ﬁngers. They ought to pull
out the cork instead of breaking oﬁ
the top of the bottle.

God would have
glasses.

The poor drink from the spigot.
I’d get all of those poor people
glasses. Then maybe I’d be God.
And I wouldn’t like that.

What’s the fun of pushing all the
buttons if you can’t run into the
next room and see the lights go on?

It’s not so much the fun, it’s the
practicality of the thing. I mean,
you can’t be in two places at the
same time, y’know. .

It isn’t that either. It’s knowing
which button to push. I’m sure you
wouldn’t know and I even suspect
that I might not. '-

Ha, getting suspicious again. Don’t
be suspicious. Be wise, be brave,
and smile as they twist the dagger.

Perhaps you’d prefer that they
merely hold the dagger while I back
into it and do my own twisting.

And always face the dagger. It’s
more fun that way.

But that way I would be able to
see what was going on and that is
against all our principles of modern
living.

Principles, principles . . . change
your principles as you go along.
There are no static principles. That’s
like believing in feudalism. The
first thing you know, you’re a fatal-
istic Fascist.

A changing principle is no longer
a. principle. You see, ﬁrst you do
something, usually something wrong.
Then you formulate" a principle to
justify what you have done, mut-
tering that you originally used that
principle as a basis for your later
action. ’ .

Quit muttering and speak likea
man. Principles change. Princi-
ples are strong. Change your prin-
ciples so thatthey will stay strong.

If you take off your blue hat and
put enacted hat, that ..doesn’t make
your blue hat red. (That “red” is
spelled with a small ,“r_.”) A

Poems

To the Editor

iiverybody loved Kai Kalwary here.
For off ’ ’ “
Everbocly loved him.‘
So we all love a wild boy keeping a
hold
On dreams he wants.
Nobody knows where Kal Kalwary
went.

 

Nobody knows why he packed . . .
a few old manuscripts
And is gone.
Gone with his hard chin
Thrust ahead of him
And his black hair blowing care-
less
Atop an honest he-ad——
Writer, painter, a cynical passionate
lover.
Were there ten or a hundred hunt-
ing Kal? - I
Were there ﬁve or ﬁfty with aching
hearts‘?
Everybody loved Kai Kalwary.
Nobody knows where he’s gone.

Decision Again
Over Panthers!

Continued from page one ,
standing‘, for each has his own sep-
arate talents and renders valuable
service to his mates. Pitt fans will
probably remember well the team’s
‘triple-thr-eater, Herman Rohrig, a
reliable passer, a
‘-top-notch punter,
and’ a swivel-
hipped, h a r d -
running ball car-
rier.

However, there
is little to choose
between Rohrig
and Harry Hopp,
a p t 1 y dubbed
Hippity, who al-
ternates with him

 

is a little better
on defense and
almost equal in
other departments. Junior Vike
Francis, the burliest and hardest
charging of the backs, plays the
plunging fullback position so adept-
ly that he is already said to be bet-
ter than his all-American brother
Sam. Walter.Luther, the right half,
is the key man in the ﬁne-working
deep reverses.

If there is any standout in the
line, it is probably Warren Alson,
191-pound senior guard. A 60-min-
ute man, Alson has yet to yield a
yard through his position this year
and specializes in spilling enemy
secondary when he leads Hopp or
Rohrig, as an interferer.

Pittsburgh fans are disinclined to
believe that the Huskers can stop
the Pitt end sweeps, for the only
uweakness in the Nebraska defense
lies in its end play. Eddie Jones
and Bo‘-.:.by Thurbon rank with the
best ball -carriers in the business
when it comes to turning the ends,
although Big George Kracum may
have some difficulty in cracking the
center of the line.

F or ICAAAA

With regular meets out of the
«sway, the University of Pittsburgh
cross-country squad is turning all
its energies toward preparing for the
IC4A meet to be held at New York
city Monday. Over 300 runners
from colleges and universities
‘throughout the country will compete
in the national competition.

Present plans for the Panthers

call for seven athletes to make the
trip to New York. Of these only
VI/‘alt Sterner, Frank McCabe, Mar-
cus Allias, John Brosky, and Bob
Davis are sure of their positions.
Tryouts will be conducted to de-
‘termine which .two of the trio of
Dave Saunders, Ben Foote, and Bob
Graham will make the trip.

Last week two more victims were —

added to the Panther list of disposed
opponents when Slippery Rock and
Penn State both felt the power:of
the Panther ﬂclaws. In their meet
with the Rockets, the Pittites turned
in a convincing 15-40 victory. State
fell beforethe Olson squad by a
25-30 count, although the Lions’
Willie Smith finished first.

Lettermen to Hold
First Social Affair

Anticipating a Panther victory
in their battle with Penn State, No-
vember 23, the Panther club will
help celebrate the victory when they
sponsor the Muscle Jump that eve-
ning. Jack Benz, BA41, chairman
of the affair has announ-ced that it
will be held ‘on Trees Gym from 9
o’clock till one. Rusty Williams’
orchestra will help the “cats” and
“gators” swing out.

Tliis is the ﬁrst social aﬁair of
the year for the Panther club, an or-
ganization of undergraduate varsity
lettermen. The price is 75 cents
per couple.

Punks Defend Independent Title
Against Golden Bears Today

 

WAA Begins
Intramural ,  
Award Setup

A new system of awards has been
introduced into the Women’s intra-
mural athletic program by the W0-
men’s Athletic Association. With
the girls entering the volleyball
tournament on class teams, each
member of the winning team will
receive a gold chenille letter “P.”
The first, second, and third place
winners in the archery tournament
will also receive letters.

The tournaments are scheduled to
begin Monday and will continue uii-
til the winning team has been se-
lected.

Two hours practice is the only re-
quirement for participation in the
program. During practice hours,
instructors will be in the gym to
aid contestants.

Class managers 101' the volleyball
tournament have been announced.
For the freshman class, Janet Steeb,
C, and Marie Bielik, C; sophomore
class, Mary Alma Olander, C, and
Peggy Brennan, C; junior class,
Irene Komoroski, C, and Anna, Mae
Busch, C; senior class, Evelyn
Green, C, and Audrey Lutz, C.

Every Women’s organization on
campus has the opportunity to form
teams. They will have the same
chance of winning as do the teams
organized by the class.

Irma Hotz, Ed4l, is handling the
entire tournament and is being aid-
ed by Mary Hilda Fagan, Ed41,
chairman of volleyball, and Ruth
Yardumiam, C43, chairman of arch-
ery.

A championship cup is the goal of
the undefeated Punks and the Gold-
en Bears today at 3 o’clock' when
they provide a thrilling finis to this
year’s successful independent touch
football race.

Coach Carlson’s boys will be odds-
on favorites to triumph over the
Golden Bears for seasonal records
point to the Punks’ superiority.
Last year's intramural champs open-
ed the season with a decisive 34-6
victory over the Vanities. “Lefty”
Ziolkowski showed his critics that
a summer of inactivity did not
hamper the accuracy of his pass-
ing arm as he uncorked four touch-
down passes.

The Cherokee Indians, a throw-
back from freshman camp, were
next to test the Punk domination,
and were outscored 18-0.

The varsity track men were the
next team to face the unbeatable
combination of the Punks, but the
VV WW team had the runners, not the
s-corers; consequently the Punks
won an easy 22-0 game.

Sam Milanovitch and Lefty Ziol-
kowski remain as the all-intramural
players from last year, in addition
to glue-ﬁngjered end, Mel Port, who
made second team on the all-iiitra-
mural combination. George Koch-
eran. speedy halfback, Jammy Klein,
Ralph Josephs, and Larry Paffrath
are capable supporters in this un-
stoppable cast of performers.

Rifle Team

All members of the riﬂe team and
sophomores who would like to try
out are asked to report to the range
in the stadium Monday at 1 o’clock.
Sophomores who qualiﬁed in marks-
manships tests last spring are es-
pecially asked to report.

IMan of the Week

THE» PITT FIRST TEAM—F»ea-
ture of an otherwise disappointing
game was the manner in which » an
inspired bunch of Panther regulars
rose up as one man and smashed
Carnegie Tech’s running attack four
times while yielding only one yard
of greensward.

J erked off the bench when Chang
Dunn blocked Ernie Bonelli’s punt
and recovered on the Pitt two-yard
line, the Panther ﬁrst stringers went
into action completely cold, warmed

-up during the brief time out period,

and came through with one of the
greatest defensive stands in the his-
tory of Pitt football.

Four times Tech’s brilliant George
Muha tore at the Pitt line, and after
the fourth time, the Tartans were
back again on the two-yard stripe,
although they had penetrated to the
one on third down, and Carnegie’s
only serious scoring threat was gone.

wonder” a decade ago. Today, with a long list of na-
tional -titles at his belt, the bowling world still wonders
just how he gets such pin-blastingpower and such hair-
line control. . . such extra power and extra control!

No question, though, how Joe Norris gets the extras in
his cigarette. He turned to the slower-burning brand . . .
Camel. ..for extra mildness and found several other
pleasing extras as well, including extra smoking.

they can add to smoking! More mildness and coolness
because Camels are free from the irritating effects of
too-fast burning. More ﬂavor—because  burning
lets the ﬂavor come through. And alontguwith extra
pleasure—extra smoking per pack (seefibielow, right).

THIS IS the "Fz'reball.” Joe Norris (above) uses a
two-ﬁnger mineralite ball with narrow grip-a
quick-breaking hook—throws one of the fastest
balls in bowling. But no speed. . .no fast burning. . .

for Joe in his cigarette. It's always slow-burning

Camels. He says: "Camels give me extra mildness.
And the_re’s nothing like a Camel for ﬂavor." ,

 

 
  
 

In recent laboratory tests, Camels burned
25% slower than the average of the 15
other of the largest-selling brands tested
--slower than any of them. That means,
on the average, a smoking plus equal to

5 EXTRA SMOKES PER PACK!

Interclass Sing

The greater part. of the activi-

VVednesday, have been cancelled,
and only the interclass sing re-
mains on the program, it was
announced today * by Martha
Wandrisco, C42, chairman of WSGA
traditions committee.

Conflict of activities has caused
the cancellation of the,_comme'mora-
tion hour, _which wa‘s'{to mark the

u.lty have been-invited to the formal
reception. ' I  ‘.

committee, ’with,Thyrsa W. Amos,
dean of women ]-and Dr. Bowman,

  

received”=the honored guests, Miss "

Margaret Lydia Stein and Miss Stel-
la Mathilda. “Stein, the first women
to enter the University?-in7.1895._. , _l

Highspot of the affair .was to
have been the presentation of _a gift
of silver to the University. The an-
nual gift is purchased from iunds
donated by all University women,
including students, faculty and ad-
ministration members.

The scholastic honors committee,
under Dorothy Weiner, C42, was al-
so planning to honor the women
who have maintained an average
of 2.5 or better during their careers
at the University up to the present
time. The names of the women
were to be inscribed on a large
scroll to be posted in the Commons
Room during the reception.

The other phase of Women’s Day,
the annual interclass sing will take
place as planned at the Heinz house
at 12:45 o’clock. A silver cup will
be awarded to the class presenting
the most spirited, original, and clev-
er 12-minute song skit. Margery
Lowy, Ed41, Virginia Glenn, C42,
and Peggy Barrett, C43, are chair-
men of their respective classes. The
freshman committee is under the di-
rection of Nadine Dean, Ed4l.

Smoke-eye

Daufenbach Requests
Observance of Rules

Smoke gets in his eyes.

But only if he ﬁnds it in places
other than the Tuck shops and the
men’s and women’s smoking rooms
in the Cathedral. William Dau-
fenbach, assistant to the dean of
men, ﬁnds it necessary to warn
students to pay more attention to
regulations regarding smoking,
wearing hats in the Cathedral, and

conduct in the Tuck shops. “We

i would like to prevent students
_ from using the halls, classrooms,

and alcoves in the building for
their smoking,” Mr. Daufenbach
declared. “Smoking rooms are pro-
vided on the second and third
floors of the Cathedral for this
purpose,”

Mr. Daufenbach also emphasized
the fact that the ground ﬂoor Tuck
shops are to be used as eating
places, and not as game rooms.
Card playing, dice-shooting, and

 sugar-cube manipulation are not
:  listed as extra-curtricular activi-

ties at Pitt, he remindsthe stu-
dents. 1

YEARS OF PAINSTAKING STUDY

The Pitt News

Opinion Survey Socialitems . . .

Shows Current

Student Ideas

Collegians Want
Peace, No U. S.
Aid to England

By Student Opinion Surveys of America

AUSTIN, TEX., Nov 15.-Unlike
U. S. public opinion, majority sen-
timent among college students to-
day holds that it is more important
tor the United States to try to keep
out of war than to help England
even at the risk of becoming in-
volved.

Simultaneously over the entire
nation, Student Opinion Surveys of
America has sent its interviewers
to query all types of‘ students on

large and small campuses, present-
ingto them a problem vital to Amer-

ican youth, a question many times

discussed in a thousand dormitory

and ?boarding house bull sessions.
With" the cooperation of the Pitt
News and scores of other newspa-

per members, the Surveys has gath-
.ered and -tabulated these opinions ‘

by means of scientiﬁc sampling
methods. Here -are the res=ults:~

: — -Students were asked which of the
_two- following things they thought

was more important for the,U. S. to
try to do. Their answers, in. per-
centages, are given after each state-
ment—-
Keep U. S. out of war, . . . . . .55%
Help England, even at the risk
of getting into the war. . . .45%
This is not what their elders think.
A Gallup poll recently pointed out

that the majority of Americans be— _

lieves the British are holding our
first line of defense and their strong
desire to avoid another war.

For two years the Surveys has
been gauging collegiate sentiment
the nation over. It has found, for
example, that majorities (in Octo-
ber 1939) would not volunteer
should the U. S. send troops to help
England and her allies, opposed (in
October 1939) changing the neu-
trality law to allow any belligerent

to buy American supplies, opposed

(in February 1940) compulsory mil-
itary training, and felt( in Febru-
ary 1940) our most important prob-

Well, its different this time. In-
stead of active honoring pledge, it’s
the pledges of the Delta Tau Delta

fraternity honoring the newcomers
of the Phi Gamma Delta, Phi Delta
Theta, Phi Epsilon, Pi Kappa Alpha,
and the Phi Kappa fraternities at a
smoker this evening. The enter-
tainment will be skits and songs by
the different pledge groups. Now
don’t fret too much boys, for the
rest of the potential fraternity broth-
ers are invited to a house dance next
Wednesday evening . . . At the Pi
Kappa Alpha house last Wednes-
day the mothers of the pledges were
feted. It was the ﬁrst meeting of
ﬁlled the_ better part of the after-
noon.

..We never know’ who is going to
be entertained next, and the Kenna
Kappa Gammas surprised us. They
gave a dinner last Sunday in honor
of their fathers. The evening was
completed with songs by Susan
Rigby with.Marjorie Day as accom-
panist . .. . A lot of fun and plan-
ning went on at the Delta Zeta
house just one week ago tonight.
They all adjourned after the Pitt
Players play to have a pajama par-
ty. The planning was for their
Christmas dance which they are de-

 

lem was to keep the country out of
war. .

These opinions have been temper-
ed somewhat by the impact of recent
events such as the fall of France,
U. S. conscription, and the spread
of the war. An indication of this
cooling opinion is the large group,
comprising 45 per cent of the stu-
dents, who at this time approve
helping England, even if we event-
ually have to fight.

Why does the majority of stu-
dents believe that our efforts should
emphasize our keeping out of war?
A University of Rochester freshman
gave this reason: “We have enough
trouble here.” A coed told the Tar-
kio (Missouri) College interviewer,
“England brought this d.own upon
herself by her conduct after the last
war.” A sophomore at the Univer-
sity of Maine spoke for the oppo-
sition when he said, “lf England is
conquered it is our turn to worry,
and we won’t have anyone to worry
with us.”

and research have put Chesterfield far out in
front in the blending and preparation of lo-
boccos to give you a cooler, bettentosling and
definitely milder cigarette. (As seen in the new
film ”TOBACCOLAND, U. S. A.”)
