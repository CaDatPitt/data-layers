The University Theatre will
present The Chairs and Jack
or the Submission, two one-
act absurdist _ comedies by
Eugene Ionesco, during, the
ﬁrst two weeks of June.

Wandalie Henshaw, Speech De-
partment Instructor, will direct
the double bill of one-act plays.
Philip Eek has designed sets, cos-
tumes, and lighting for these pro-
ductions.

The plays embrace a variety of
absurdist characters and incidents
-——a fiancee with three quivering
noses whose nine-ﬁngered hand
squirms like a writing trunk of
snakes, and prospective in—laws
who savor each other‘s household
odors. '

Ream Lazare, president pro-
tempore of the Pitt Players, has
been cast‘as Jack in Jack or the
Submission.‘ Bonny Ratner is
Roberta. Anne McLaughlin and
Jim Berry, respectively, will play
Mother Jack and Father Jack, op-

farce features an old couple who
ﬁll an auditorium to overﬂowing

free to faculty and students, begin '

Dr. Martin Gives ‘Last Lecture’

By LARRY BERNFELD

Dr. Albert Martin, in pre-
paring his topic for the SUB’s
“Last Lecture” series, began
to View his actual ﬁnal lec-
ture with forboding.‘ “I start-
ed to feel that mylast lecture

would be ﬁfty minutes of silence,
punctuated by sighs . ”

Rather than indulging in ﬁfty
minutes of philosophical silence
last Monday in the SU lower
lounge, Dr. Martin dealt with
“Public Responsibilities in the
Educated man,” responsibilities
which must be directed towards
all of society, rather than to the
specific interests of the educated
ma_n himself.

Dr. Martin feels the University
can provide insulation in which an
in\dividual’s thoughts can develop.
At the same time it can provide
“like envi_ronment of similar
thinking men to stimulate him. He
emphasized, however, the Univer-

four main objectives in her bid for world power...

uniﬁcation.’ Red China must resolve her internal strife before she can
have an effect on the world. ._ ' ,

tioned is her hunger _for nuclear. weapons. China boasts that she‘
will explode her ﬁrst nuclear device in a few years. Hinton-feels,

rite.-Pittsburgh summer rztealre   5...... . . .

  By WAYNE CLAEREN

.I’m spending my ’ ﬁrst
summer‘ in Pittsburgh in
several years so today’s

‘ theater report is chiefly for
of the second annual William Pitt it

others in_ .the same boat. I
ﬁnd there are plenty of op-

portunities {for those who enjoy
a good show on their. occasional

(?) night away from the books.

As the_days grow longer and

“Summer is icumen’ in,” certain

. trends can be seen in the drama A
world. Movie goers can look_for-_,
ward to plenty of re-runs and-

/"

thus a chance to see some top

,,ﬂicks you may have missed the

ﬁrst time around. _

- One of the.best bets in this
line will be the Film Festival at
the Pittsburgh Playhouse, within
walking distance of school, to
begin July-,9th. Past summers
have seen some real film classics
(both U.S. and foreign) in this
series. .
Summer Stock

Summer skies of course mean
summer stock to stage fans and
in this area we can ﬁnd a stock
company in. whatever direction

. we might. turn.

On the North Side of the
City, the Beverly Hills Play-
house has already startedvits

season. “My Three Angels” is, ,

the current attraction. Others

scheduled — ,“'l‘he Hasty,
. _H‘ea.l?.t,”7 “Take Her. -'she's_
Mine," and “King oi‘ Hearts.”
V In the South Hills, The Little.
Lake Theater opens in mid-June
-and its features "will include
“Under the Yum Yum Tree” and
“Calculated Risk.” Both Little
Lake and Beverly Hillsare The-
aters in the Round. A

A Country Drive

Feel like a country drive. to
the East. of town? Stop at the
White Barn Theater on Route
_V3_0.. The Barn has an allvmusical
bill this -season opening with
“Gypsy” on June 9th. “Damn
Yankees," “Milk and Honey,”
“Bells are Ringing,” “Fanny,”
and several other hits will each
have two week runs. ‘

The above theaters. areal! a
pleasant 30 minutes drive from
the University in respective
directions. — ‘

' I am an old Summer Stock fan

and I feel that the increase in-

number .,and quality of stock
theaters in recent years is “an
excellent sign. The real poten-
tial for the American Theater.

 Wc’d like ito say some nice things

about America’s young adult drivers     

A And we think we've got good reason! Last Janilary, we selected
twenty 18- and 19-year-old young men and women through the
Junior Achievement program to drive our team of Chevrolets in
the Mobil Economy Run, April 3-9. It was the ﬁrst time any
company had relied entirely on drivers with limited experience in

this exacting competition.

We brought these young
adults-—most of them college
students, some from the busi-
ness world-'-to Arcadia,

' California, in late February.
For six weeks, our expert
teachers trained them in the
skills of economy driving.

 

Then, on April 3, they set oil
on the Run, 3,243 miles from
Los Angeles to NewlYork.
We were going against the
grain. It takes high proﬁ-
ciency to win the Mobil
Economy Run. Competition
is tough. Why did we rely

 

on drivers with such limited
experience?

Chevrolet wanted to give
the Chevy Teen Team a
chance to prove in front, of
the nation _that they and the
6.5 million licensed drivers in
their age bracket are safe,
sane people behind the wheel.
We felt the Run offered a
splendid chance. "

Team in the Mobil’Economy
Run did remarkably well
compared with the class
winners in overall miles-per-
gallon figures. -The final
results are a tribute to the ,
high degree of driving skill "
displayed by the Chevy Teen"
Teamrepresenting the youth

of America.  ‘-

No wonder wefre proud of
»Ame_rica’s young adult
drivers. We couldn't have a
better reason.
