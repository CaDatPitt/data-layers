Varsity Program
Tonight Features
Cap, Gown Skits

High school seniors from the entire
iri-state district will flood the walks
zalld by-ways of the campus today and

tomorrow for the first annual Inter-
scholastic program.

Perhaps outstanding on the two-day
:-‘chedule is Varsity Night, called for
tonight at Carnegie Music hall.
James Boyle, C35, chairman of the
event, has prepared a “colossal” pro-
‘.-;ra1n including such things as Cap
and Gown skits, a Pitt Players one-
uct, interfraternity sing, speeches, se-
lections by Dr Louis lgnelzi, whiz
alumnus banjo artist, and a talk by
Dr. John Bain Suthe-rlaud, varsity
football coach, who has promised to
lwflllg along some surprises.

Varsify Night begins about 9 o'clock,
with hordes of high school seniors
elbowing a second horde of_.Univer-
sity undergraduates for choice seats
for the three-hour fun session.

But that’s this evening.

This afternoon, men's social frater-
nities chase over the Bellelleld, Bigo-
low, Bayard sweepstakes stretch in
-{our 440 relays over which they push
very screwy and very exciting objects
which resemble baby-buggies-but
which ain’t. Spills at 40 miles per
hour are expected, but not promised.

The sweepstakes race follows the
women's fraternities’ ﬂoat parade,
which in turn follows 9. concentrated
attack by the cadet ROTC corps on
dress parade.

The ROTC starts marching at about
2 o’clock, the women start parading
their ﬂoats approximately 15 minutes
later.

The theme of the float contest re-
volves about customs in the nations
represented by nationalities rooms in
the Cathedral in the celebration of
the coming of spring.

Tomorrow, at the stadium, enough
people will be running about in track
pants to shake a few sticks at. The
varsity and freshman track squads
will take on West Virginia university
in a dual meet, while hundreds of
other track men, representing high
schools from all points cf the tri-state
area, will participate in an interscho-
lastic meet.

A massed all-city high school band
will play during meet intermissions.

Two hundred students from the Erie
and Johnstown centers of the Uni-
versity will arrive here tomorrow
morning for an all-day program of
events. Before noon, they will visit

the Cathedral and Carnegie Museum.
After lunch at Heinz House, they will
take part in track and swimming
events in the Stadium and Trees
gym under the directionof John Dam-
bach, professor of physical education.
A dance at Heinz House in the eve-
ning will follow a buffet supper there.
The visit has been arranged by Frank
"W, Shockley, director, and C. Stanton
Belfour, assistant director of the Ex-
tension Division.

Wylie’s Band Plays
At Festival Dance

“Gallia est omnis divisa in partes
tres,” said Caesar.

“Tomorrow’s_ my birthda.y,”tsays
Ellis H. Tumpson, BA36, Spring Fes-
tival dance chairman.

There is no connection.

The deep and subtle signiﬁcance is
that tomorrow night’s annual Festi-
val dance at the Hotel Schenley ball-
room will be in the form of a birth-
day party, with no presents expected
but many presences anticipated, if
one will allow one to be a bit smart,
what? _ > ~-

There is no grand march scheduled
for the four hours of dancing from
9 to 1 o’clock, precluding Tumpson’s
showing off his dance queen, Betty
Smith.

Austin Wylie’s NB(_‘. broadcasting
band, here after what publicity men
call a “triumphant" engagement in
Cleveland, has been booked for the
evening.

As pf'Lt of his birthday party, to
which all studems with $2 are in-
rited (and apparently hundreds have
32 to judge from the advance sale),
Tumpson offers free and without any
strings attaclied, the scandal-ridden,
muck-raking, exploiter or private sen-
timents and private grafts, the 1935
Razz Rag, edited by a staff which was
feeling particularly vitriolic at the
time concerning many campus nota-
‘oles and faculty solons.

The yellow sheet will be distributed
sometime during the evening.

The dance, according to all rational
customs. is primarily a/celebration af-
t'air—not so..much for..the chairman's
birthday but for those men and women
who are honored at today's Tap day
ceremonies. The ballroom will be
decorated in keeping with Tap day,
with all honoraries sharing in the
decoration motifs.

This seems to be an auspiciouséweek
for the heads of the various Festival
events, Tumpson’s birthday is to-
morrow; Marjorie Reich, C35, coed
chairman of the week. celebrated
hers Wednesday as she helped open
the week’s fun at the Festival tea
dance.

HO VVON THE SENIOR AVVARD and the Senior Queen honors at tap

The highest honor open to a Uni-

Frances McLaughlin was named Al-
ma Mater.

The (first of the revived annual Sen-
ior Awards, given to the man deem-
ed most, outstanding in activities,

Lanfear, dean of men.

professor and head of the journalism

The Hall of Fame—the 20 outstand-
ing senior men and ,women chosen
for the 1935 Owl, appeared in the an-
nual which was published today.

Smashing records and precedents
with abandon, the yearbook almost
scores a “beat” on the tri-weekly,
double tap day editions of The Pitt
News, by coming out with pictures of
Senior Queen, Alma Mater and the
Senior award, just a few moments
after these people are tapped to their
honors. The original pictures were
obtained without disclosing tap se-
crets, ezren to those who will be
tapped.

Subscribers for the Owl may.-re
ceive their copies immediately after
tapping ceremonies in the Owl oﬂice,
Room 801. Cathedral.

On the ﬁrst Friday in I\Iay-—-
for some reason having to do
with an ancient tradition——under—
graduates put on their brightest
necktics and whitest shoes and
string rows of burnished activity
keys across their bosoms. The
coeds——Grod bless "eni-—ordinarily
outdo the lilies of the ﬁeld. And
even the most. sedate academ-
icians go off to lunch without
their hats. _

Try to ﬁnd a trace of academic
black.

Try to see a brief case or a
slide-rule or a textbook.

The ‘scholars had their tap day
a few weeks ago.
reverence has been paid to that
kind of achievement. Today we
intend to parade, cheer outstand-
ing iuidergrads, or just sit under
a tree and chew grass.

This sort of thing has been go-
ing on for years and years.

We invite you to join the Fes-
tival. Give us your ideas, if you
like, on better stream-lined push-
mobiles, better honorary societies
and better editorials.

I Wall Writing

IT IS related tliat once while
certain Bal.)_VlO11lSl1. potentates
sat at their revels their irrespon-
sible fun was checked by the
vision of a moving ﬁnger, Whlch
traced in burning letters:
“\Veiglied in the balance . . .”
and more which it would be te-
dious to quote.

The wall writing hinted that
there was going to be a new sys-
tem in Babylon. And, according
to the references, a new and very
superior type of government was
set up the next morning, after
the Persians had climbed in by
way of the aqueduct.

There is a suggestion of wall
writing, too, in the announcement
that a score of juniors and sopho-
mores are scheduled to meet with
the Publications Board soon, with
charts and plans and speeches,
promising to make The News,
The Panther and The Owl respect-
able in 1936. Amid the trample
of their triumphant feet goes up
the thin wail of Belshazzar and
his companions: “We meant the
best. ‘We're sorry that we have
to go.”

‘Science As A

Based On

 

:The Solution Offered Seenis Logical But F unctions
Only When Persons Beconie Units Of An Automaton

By Herrymon Maurer

ODAY VVE are becoming more and

more aware of the ruin about us.
The collapse of our cultures has be-
come so evident that some speak of
its,gleath as imminent, while others,
wedded b)"Cl1i€liDS of gold to a dying
culture can deny the severity of the
illness only by confusing health with
disease.

Many of our economists have an-
nounced that the present systeni can-
not deceiitly support the people whose
labor supports it; novelists and poets
in (lesp-air‘ have told us that human
nature has become warped; sociolo-
gists have criticized the institutions of
inar1'iag‘c and of the faiiiily as they
operate today. Indeed, no a.ctivily or
illSlltl1i.lO;l has escaped criticisni.

Newer Ideals

Not. only do scholars and artists lay
bare the decay which has come upon
‘us; our own observations corroborate
the truth of their investigations. I‘.-’e
can but recognize: the serioiisness of
the collapse; furllier, we can but
recog,'nize the pressing necessity for
some tool, some conceptioiis. some
methods of approach which will help
us‘ create the new upon the ruins oi‘
the old.

It has pleased certain sanguinely
licpei‘:ul persons to present science as
the new messiah. If we listen to sci-
ence. if we accept its materialistic
outlool-:. they say, all will be well. all
the problenis of our civilization will
be solved. This point of view has
good traditioiial sanction. For some
izundreds 01' years science has been
adored as a god who not only pro-

Critical Attitude

In past days when railroads were
quite new and quite unsafe, it was
not unusual for passengers to walk
up and down the platform before de-
ciding which coach appeared to be of
the most substa.nt.ial construction.
Today removed from fear of wrecks
and fortilﬁed by a knowledge of steel

critical of the ideas we use as vehicles.

_ Tradition And Truth

l\ e- become aware, ﬁrst of all, that
tradition insures the truth of science.
Science is an eternal absolute which
we have been lucky enough to dig.
cover. But. is it an eternal absolute?
The Greeks had a scientiﬁc outlook;
.V.’_et. science did not sustain them. It
«lid not even sustain itself; g1'adua]1y

discovered it and made it a basis for
its D'_11i10S_0D113’- Science certainly is

interest in inaterial objects, the lack ofi
interest in human l)eiugs——1)la.tit1ides§
wliicli make wealth more easily pro-}
curable which ere-.ited science. Sci-
encedid not create those attitudes.
Einstein"s Concept

Science, furtliermore, is able to
keep in touch with the clianges oi‘
niind within our civilization. Durwiii
in the early nineteenth century wrote
his biology in terms of the survival
of the ﬁttest, a concept friendly to
those who enjoy a luxury that results
from exploitation. In the twentietli
century, Einstein reflected the spirit
of hopelessness of gaining absolute
knowledge; he made the iiiiiveisc,
relative to the point from which it
was observed. But he was too far
away from the general sczieiitifle toni-
per, the general temper of his age, and
so science is reluctant to accept his
1:-ropositious.

Limits Of Science

Upon closer exaiiiiiiatioxi, we ﬁnd
not only tli:-at science has deﬁnite his-
torical cause, but that its ﬁeld of ac-
ti\'iiy is liniited. At best it is able to
explain things somewhat as they are;
it is unable to explain causes, so loiigg
as it. reinains bound by :1. i1iatlieii1a.‘L-2
ically-dictated method. ii’ we ask sci-,’
ence wliat life is, or what it is worth. ;
or wlizit is its iiieaiiiiig, it can begiii;
to work only with i'(leii1.iIi<-s and can;
end only by i'es;tatiiig cqu-.:l.<._ Science, l

worth, (-.am1o';', as Tolstoy puts it. re-
concile anvtliin_g' ﬁnite with anything
inﬁnite. 1\l'eyei‘son, the French scien-
tist, suggests that science can concern _
itself only with a static universe.‘
Bergsoii says that science is of use
only for the material things it helps
to fa.bi-icate; that it can make no
claim to knowledge.

Act Of Faith

\-Vlien science deserts inatlieniatical
clarity, it begins to bring in a new
set of suppositions. Dai'win’s theory
of evolution requires belief, an act of
faitli, in an eternal state of progress
and in continual responsiveness to the
environment. He who believes in the

the most logical evolutionist.

To get some basis for reasoning, the
scientist announces that whatever is

exists. \\»'e do not know that there
are atoms and protons and electrons.

And to give extensive me-aiiings to

one corner of the universe are appli-
<_-able ihrougliout. The laws of insect
life inay llt‘ c.o1up;ii'ed to the laws oi‘
human life.
Disregard Of People" --

Science does provide a. way of look-
ing; at life. It is preoccupied with
tliiiigs; it; dis1'egards persons. Even
Marx, moved by 3 great synipaihv for
the uuder-privileged, was so affected.
by his bourgeois backgrounds as to
reason scieiitifically about the world
and the universe and 1.0 hope for ma-
terial lienetlis for the people for
whose intei'cs't.s he worked. His fol-
1owc1's are fond of comparing him, a

‘man with huinan feeling-;s, to Darwin,

a man with laboratory opinions, be-
caiise they both approved of the Sci-
entiﬁc method. This comparison is
s:icri.le:.;e, but a sacrilege which has
only too much basis in truth.
Dangerous Philosophy
