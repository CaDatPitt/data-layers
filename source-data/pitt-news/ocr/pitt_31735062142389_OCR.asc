The sirens, which will service
the entire Oakland district, were
tested along with all the other si-
rens in the city last Monday, and
the authorities are, generally, well
pleased with the results.

Although a number of dead spots
were discovered in the range of the
siren on the Cathedral, as was the
case throughout the whole city dis-
trict, steps are being taken to re-
movethein by the installation of a
number of smaller supplementary
sirens from place to place.

The horns installed on the Cathe-
dralfare of the Dilks type. They are

electrically controlled and are op-

erated by powerful self—contained
air compressors approximately
twenty inches in diameter. They are
mounted on- especially constructed
wooden frames, and face east and
west from the Cathedral of Learn-
mg.

The air raid sirens rotate over
approximately 240 degrees. There
was some installation difliculty due
to a shortage of the joints which
caused the rotation. As a last re-
sort the sirens were installed with
rotating ' joints taken from wash-
ing machines.

According to‘ Bernard Nichols,

“No girl ought to think of her
University life without giving some
time to war activities.” That is the
opinion of Helen Pool Rush, dean
of women.

“Certainly every Pitt girl is.
needed for war work,” added Mary
Rita Keenan, E43, chairman of the
War Activities committee. At least
550 Pitt women are needed immedi-
ately.

There-are many types of work
offered and every girl is urged to
take part in those activities which
most interest her. John J. Geise
and J. Stanley Gray, faculty mem-
bers in charge of civilian defense,
have quite an elaborate program
ready—all that is needed are vol-
unteers.

For this Civilian Defense pro- :

gram the following are needed: 350
messengers, 40 clerical workers, 80
girls‘ to “stand by” for telephone
messages, 12 drafters to ~ draw

building plans, ﬁre watchers, and air 3

raid wardens. Classes for training
people to serve in the latter two
capacities will be started at any
time that 50 students express inter-
est. Each of these opportunities
will be "described in detail in later
issues of the News.

But War Activities for women do
not stop there. Already many or-
ganizations and departments on
campus have started other war
Work. The Women’s Athletic asso-
ciation, for example, is offering a

physical ﬁtness course. Women’s .

Speech association is sponsoring
forums on current war problems
and discussion groups have been
started to promote student interest
in talking over current events.

Then, too, there are ﬁrst,~ aid
courses and home nursing courses
in progress. Students may still en-
roll for these courses on the twelfth
ﬂoor. After completing a first aid
course, girls may serve by forming
ﬁrst aid crews for air raid work.

“We do not want to do away with
ordinary Pitt activities,” said Miss
Rush. “These traditional activities
must merely be changed to meet
war time’ needs. It is because of
these well-organized activities that
war work on such a large scale is
possible.”

Pitt "Players Will
Conduct Tryouts

Tryouts for “Till the Day I Die,”
next Pitt Players production, ‘will
be conducted‘ in .332 Cathedral on
Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday
of next week at 3:30 o’clock. _

A number of parts are available
for both men‘ and women, Buell
Whitehill, director of the Players,
announced. Anyone may tryout for
a role. It is not‘ necessary that he
be a member of Pitt Players.

“Till The Day I Die,” by Clifford
Odets, is a moving drama about the
underground movement as it exists
in Nazi Germany. Rehearsals will
begin as soon as the cast is selected,
and the first performance will be
given at the end of this month.

Dies in Panama

Fatally injured in a fall from
an observation tower, Lieutenant
Ralph M. N. Hines died Sunday in
Gorgas Hospital, Panama, where he
was on duty with the U.S. Coast
Artillery at Fort Clayton, Panama
Canal Zone. .

Lt. Hines graduated from the
School of Education last January
and was inducted into the army
February 25. He had been stationed

in the Canal Zone for seven months-

before his death, and very recently
was promoted to a first lieutenant.
Prior to his Canal one assignment,
he was stationed at Fort Eustis, Va.

While at Pitt, Lt. Hines was very
active in campus affairs and held
membership in Pitt Riﬂes, Scabbard
and Blade, Kappa Phi Kappa, and
"Cap and Gown. He was an advanced
officer in ROTC and received his
commission six months before
graduation

Hines, however, was best known
on campus for his work as chairman
of the successful SFA book drive
last year.

Pitt’: Penny Drive Spreads
To District Grade Schools

By BILL LYTLE

Pitt Penny plan is rapidly spread-
ing throughout the Pittsburgh dis-
trict. Turtle Creek public school
has collected and turned in to Pitt
32,350. pennies to be returned to
circulation. Etna high school will
hold a collection in which they hope
to collect 8,000 pennies.

From all sources to date 11,000
pennies have been traded in to Dr.
J. Ellwood Amos, associate pro-
fessor of ﬁnance, and the commit-
tee of freshman business adminis-
tration students conducting the
drive.

Carnegie Institute of Technol-
ogy, Duquesne University, Pennsyl-
vania College for Women, Pitts-
burgh public schools, Wilkinsburg
public schools, and Edgewood public
schools are considering holding ex-
changes but havepadopted no deﬁ-
nite plans as yet. a

over 13,000 pennies which she had
collected from friends. She also
presented the plan to Turtle Creek
public schools and brought in the
pennies which they had collected,
wrapped and counted.

Purpose of the drive is to return
old pennies to circulation and thus
reduce the amount of copper that
must be used at the mint each
month for pennies. Dr. Amos is of
the opinion that if the drive can
once catch on in the Pittsburgh dis-
trict and Allegheny County it will
be well on its way to national
prominence. '

Associate press, United press,

pointed out that nearly every big

such a plan.

have the‘_ﬁnal yes or no to the plan.

‘have-‘been as-tough’ as it is had the Bucks won last’Saturday.

In their past three games the
‘Bowsermen haven’t been playing
the brand of ball they ﬂashed
earlier this season. They reached
their peak against Great Lakes, but
haven’t been the same since. Per-
haps the strain of taking a pound-
ing unrelentlessly for 53 minutes
before succumbing to the Gobs
power was just too much for them.
Perhaps the fact that they had no
letup in their schedule until the
Tech game has caused them to
fall apart at the seams.
iWhatever the cause, it must be
remedied before tomorrow if Pitt
has any hopes of winning. Ohio

‘State may be so intent on revenge
that they’ll be overly anxious. Also, '

instead of rebounding there may be
a letdown.

However, Pitt must snap out of
it. The Buckeyes are tough and
they’re mad. They are the natural
favorites. Pitt probably wouldn’t
win tomorrow,. but nothing is deﬁ-
nite with the inconsistent Panthers.

by beating their favorite rivals, Phi

Phi Epsilon Pi was next on their
list, and another easy victory. This

the following week. By the time the

Gives Locals

Edge Over Foe   i

By EARL SURLOFF

, While an underdog va1'sity,_
squad tangles with the power-

ful Buckeyes of Ohio -State to-
morrow, Coach Bob Hoel and
a roster of some twenty-‘ﬁve
odd freshmen hopefuls move
in on Columbus to meet an untested
O.S.U. freshmen eleven at Ohka
Stadium today.

Today’s clash marks the ﬁrst ap-
pearance of the Panther yearling:
since they held a highly touted
Navy J ay-Vee aggregation to a 6-6
tie at Annapolis a month ago. The
Buckeyes on the other hand, will
be playing their ﬁrst game of the
current campaign against the Jun-
gle Cats. , ,

Although little is actually known
about the strength of the Western
Conference lads, hopes for a local
victory are running high.

In their recent encounter with
the Navy Jay-Vee squad, the boys
from the ‘sky-scraper school‘corn-
bined speed, power and deception
to come from behind and tie the
midshipmen in a strong ﬁnal pe-
riod drive. And while the contest
ended in a deadlock, it was in re-
ality a moral victory for the local

freshmen as the Annapolis on ﬁt
is ratedlone of the most powe ul
in the eastern circuit.

Coach Hoel will probably ﬁeld the
same team that started against the
Navy. At the ends it will be Cum.-
-mins and Debar, at the tackles,
Saxon and Kohut, at the guards,
Davidek and Lukowsky and Frank
Novak plugging up the center or
the line. The backﬁeld will show
Catarinella at quarter, Mario and
Bennett at the halfback positions
and Lindy Lauro at full.

meetings.

(This is the second in a series
of stories about the sections 67 the
University which are not well
known to the students of Pitt be-
cause of their limited enrollment.
The School of Applied Social
Sciences is one of these divisions.
In 1942, with the shortage of social
workers this school is preparing
men and women for an occupation
which needs trained workers.)

Billy Smith runs away from

can't ﬁnd a house to rent. “These,”
explained Dean Wilbur Irvin New-

stetter of the School of Applied-’

Social Sciences, “are typical of the
situations that call for the services
of a social worker.”

“Here at the University,” he
continued, “our school is training
students to be of service to people

along in life without help from
