I-F Ball Tonight
To Feature Motif
Of Valentine Day

Greeks, Non-Greeks, To Mingle
In William Penn Ballroom As
Tal Henry Provides Music

Combining Valentine Day and all
that goes with it with the. lnterfra-
ternity Ball tonight. Greeks and non-
Greeks all over the campus are look-
ing forward to the affair which has
been ballyhooed as the “dance of
dances.”

Favors, decorations, and programs,
according to Frank Frederick, C36,
Theta. Chi, chairman. will have an un-
surpassed originality, and he promises
tha.t they will have at least something
to do with St. Valentine’s Day, and
maybe even with the fraternities
themselves.

1 al I-l_enry’s band-comes direct from
the Hotel Gibson in Cincinnati. and
ﬁnished an eight-months’ engagement
at the ‘Hotel New Yorker in New York
City late in 1935. That the genial
young director is well-liked is shown
both by the frequency with which he
has been selected for University af-
fairs and by the statements in his
press releases.

In and out of many fraternity
houses this evening, the Greeks will
be holding formal dinners before the

. ball, a time-honored custom in frater-

nity tradition. But that does not
mean that the crowd in the ma.in ball-
room of the ‘William Penn will be ex-
clusively Greek. Non-fraternity men
have in the past been present in large
numbers, and tickets may be pur-
chased by anyone. Greek or non-
Greek, from any member of the com-
mittee.
Frederick, Jane Booth Lead

Leading the grand march (there
will be a grand march, by the wa.y)
with Frederick will be Jane Booth,
Ed36. An enlarged list of escorts and
escortees will probably be found in
the “Pittpourri” column on page two.

According to advance reports,
Philip Andrews, M36, Sigma Alpha
Epsilon, business manager, expects
between 300 and 500 couples, but
gives assurance that “there will be
plenty of room for everybody to dance

Dr. Holmes Tells Forum To Bring
Schools Into Line With Times

The trouble with our educational
system today is that we are using 19th
century ideas and models with a 20th
century spirit. This tendency is like-
wise discernable in our moral, social,
industrial, political, and economic
systems.

Thus Dr. Jesse H. Holmes, profes-
sor emeritus of philosophy at Swarth-
more College, characterized our mod-
ern civilization. Dr. Holmes spoke on
“Education in a Changing Economic.
System,” before the Pittsburgh Com-
munity Forum, Monday evening.

“Furthermore,” he added, “we al-
wa.ys strive for greater advancement
in science, and industry, and when we
do get easier working and living con-
ditions, we live in constant fear be-
cause we have done our jobs too well.
and we are not certain when these
jobs will terminate.

“Industrial institutions have fallen
down," he said. “We don’t think of
commodities as things for use, but
rather as things for sale. We are ac-
tually afraid that we will have the
things we want, therefore we burn
coffee, burn wheat, and plow cotton.

“Into such an economic system, we
turn out students. Inventors strive
for greater eﬁiciency, things are made
ea.sier, yet there is no opportunity to
ﬁt these people into our complicated
system. This is the sort of thing that

.d31.1.C9-.

is ruining our school system. We tell
students that they are needed. It is
dangerous when we begin to break
down the morale of young people by
telling them that they are not
needed.”

In listing some of the institutions
that block progress in trying to keep
19th century ideals as standards, Dr.
Holmes mentioned the Chambers of
Commerce; the American Legion;
and the Daughters of the American
Revolution, among others. “It is
these bodies which are so anxious to
get us back to the conditions of our
ancestors,” he concluded.

Teams Get Chance
At ‘All-U’ Dance

Award Prizes To Couples Winning
Contest To Select Best Dancers

The two outstanding dance teams
at the University will be selected at
the ﬁrst SFA afternoon dance of the
school year in Hotel Schenley main
bal.room Monday. “Any Pitt student
is eligible for the University ba‘.lr0om
dance title and runner-up awards,”
announces VVilliam McQuade, CE37,
chairman of the “All—U-Dance.”

Two tickets to the College Associa-
tion informal on February 28 will be
awarded to the “University dance
champions,” with the second-position
team receiving two complimentary
tickets to the Engineers’ dance, sched-
uled for one week after the CA affair.

‘White identiﬁcation cards will be
another innovation at the All-U tea
_Cp-liarles_ Ebert,
chairman of publiorelations and lead-
er of the vice squad, will be armed
with a batch of pins, an equal num-
ber of white tags, and at least three
fountain pens to take care of the
identiﬁcation process.

Behind closed doors, Ebert was
firmly convinced, yesterday, that
“they shall not pass until properly
identiﬁed,” but later shakily admit-
ted, “Of course, Monday is another
day.”

Earl Mellen’s music will be heard
from 3 to 6 o’cl.ock. This nine-piece
local dance band played for several
recent campus affairs, including the
Newman Club dance. Mellen directs
the band in addition to ‘performing
his featured—vocalist and guitar duties.

Even-numbered dances will be tag,
and the odd ones- strictly “date” num-
bers. according to present plans. This
will be in line with the late popular
practice of alternating tag and date‘
dances not only to offer variety but
also to “weed out the stag line.”
“We do not even wa.nt the choicest
stag line-up, and the SFA committee
guarantees to promote dancing for
everyone,” promises SFA Social
Chairman McQuade.

Students’ Scripts
Have Possibilites

Biddle Foresees “Good Chances"
For Undergraduate Authors

“The chances are pretty good that
we will have a stud'ent-written Cap
and Gown show this year,” says Theo-
dore W. Biddle, assistant dean of
men and chairman of the production

Two manuscripts are now under
consideration, that of Theodore Whit-
aker, C38, and Jackson Speer, C38,
and that of Robert Saffron, C38, and
Nicholas Spanos, BA38.

At a meeting of the production
committee Monday evening, the au-
thors received criticisms and sugges-
tions. Their work was sent yesterday
evening, after corrections, to Theo-
dore W. Viehman, newly-appointed di-
rector, who is in Chicago.

Mr. Viehman will return here with
the scripts Sunday, when he will
schedule meetings with the authors.

The production committee will also
meet with Mr. Viehman and with
Gene Kelly, assistant director, on Sun-
day.

Mr. Biddle announces that the con-
tract with the Nixon Theater has been
signed scheduling the show for the
week of April 20.

Pros, Cons Of AA UP Action

Cited In New

Alumni Revie.

 

By John Martinco
The pros and cons of the recent ac-
tion of the American Association of
University Professors in striking the
University from its eligible list are

discussed in a series of statements,
letters and reports appearing in the
January issue of the Alumni Review,
which came off the presses this week.

Included are statements by Dr. Ma-
rion K. McKay, professor and head of
the department of economics and
president of the local chapter of the
AAUP, and Dr. Robert T. Hance, pro-
fessor of biology, who represented the
local group at the national convention
of the AAUP in St. Louis, where the
action was taken. Under the title of
“What is the AAUP,” Dr. McKay
makes a statement defending the
widely-publicized organization. Dr. Mc-
Kay states that the AAUP can by no
honest reason be regarded as a “ra-
dical” group. “It is not a group that
is looking for trouble.” he points out.
“On the contrary, its membership is
made up of high-minded, loyal, and
patriotic men and women who have
dedicated their lives to teaching, and
whose primary interest therefore lies
in seeking that degree of professional
cooperation that will enable our edu-
cational institutions to carry through
more effectively their major function.
namely, the widest dissemination of
knowlege.” He then goes on to ex-
plain the membership and functions of
the local chapter.

Also printed is the statement of Dr.
McKay at the St. Louis convention in
which he outlines the remarkable
progress of the University, notes that
it is located in a conservative, indus-
trial section, where change is apt to
come slowly, and urges that the con-
vention consider whether its action
will accelerate or retard its forward
march.

In the report of Dr. lHance before
the local chapter, and made public in
the Review, the biology professor re-
ports all the facts pertaining to the
situation which he was able to ob-

ta.in. “As has been true in other and
similar cases,” Dr. ‘Hance declares,
“the Association will be more desir-
ous of restoring the University to its
eligible list than it was to remove it.”
He explains that the restoration will
follow the removal of the cited causes
for unrest among the faculty.

A collection of official correspond-
ence on the subject emphasizes the
fact that the only provision which the
ruling entails is that the local chapter
is prohibited from receiving any new
members to add to its present roster
of 81.

Chancellor John G. Bowman gives
his viewpoint in a short statement.
Dr. Bowman says, “Our policy of
academic tenure and freedom is that
we want a teacher to be competent;
to believe that he has something to
give; to be honest and sensible. No
man of these qualities at the Univer-
sity has in many years had reason to
think about freedom and tenure.”

A group of articles reprinted from
current publications divulge very con-
ﬂicting opinions. “A Statement on
Academic Freedom” from the Bulle-
tin of the Association of American
Colleges upholds the AAUP
while statements by Dr.
Murray Butler, president of Columbia
University, and Dr. Robert C. Clothier,
president of Rutgers University, and
formerly dean of men here, side with
the University viewpoint. ,

In another article, “University of
Pittsburgh Enrollment-190-0| to 1934,”
Dr, W. A, Lunden, assistant professor
of sociology at the University, com-
ments on the remarkable growth of
the institution from 859 students in
1900 to an enrollment in 1934-1935 of
10,412.

An undergraduate contributes to the
current issue of the Review as E‘u-
gene Burkhart, C36, writes “Organiz-
ing the Alumni Glee Club.” Robert
X. Graham, director of publicity, con-
tinues his gathering of campus news,
and Frank F. Carver. director of
athletic publicity reviews this year's
basketball season to date.

speaker, the group has procured Finn‘

Classes PVill Be Shortened
So That All Schools May
Hear Dr. Crane

Plans for the University YM-YVVCA
Emphasis Week beginning next Mon-
day have been released from the office
of Vvilliam W. Mendenhall, executive
secretary,

The speaker at the gathering will
be Dr. Henry H. Crane, from Scran-
ton, Pa. Dr. Crane comes to Pitts-
burgh in the course of his engage-
ments at other colleges in this dis-
trict. He is to launch the program
that will carry through all of next

week. » ~ v - -- -

According to Mr. Mendenhall, the
week has been planned to give the
average University student a fuller
idea of the scope of the campus Y.
Too many students, he believes, know
of the YMCA only as sponsor of sev-
eral clubs, 21 lounging and lunch room,

a.nd occasional joint association
nights. The program for next week,
he avers, will be a.n outstanding op
portunity for students to become ac-
quain.ted with the YMCA program in
some of its more varied activities.

The program will begin Monday
with an assembly of all University
students. The meeting was to have
taken place in the Merriorial Hall au-
ditorium, but because of the recondi-
tioning of the l.iuilding by PVVA work-
ers. the scene will be the First United
Presbyterian Church, on Forbes
Street, just opposite the Schenley
Apartments. All Monday morning
classes will be cut ten minutes short-
er than usual. in order to do away
with the problem of missing one en-
tire class.

Continues Tuesday, Wednesday

Also on Tuesday and Wednesday of
next week, Dr. Crane will lead discus-
sion groups scheduled a.t the First U_.
P. Church. Because of his studies of
the economic structure of the country,
Dr. Crane has chosen to speak on the
subject, “Truth for These Times.”
These meetings will be held during
the ﬁfth hour period.

The regular YM-YWCA Association
Night will begin on Vvednesday with
a seminar led by Dr. Crane and lead-
ers of the city. There will be :1 social
hour just before the dinner, which is
scheduled to begin at 6:15 o'clock.

These meetings, open to all stu-
dents, will form the main basis of the
week. However, there will be numer-
ous other meetings when other lead-
ers will address smaller groups either
S'p.’.)nSOl‘e(1 by the Y or else in contact
with it. Group X, Pitkin Club, the
freshman groups, and the Y Council,
are expected to hear from the leaders
during their regular meeting hour.
The Engineers’ Club of the YMCA
will hear a talk by Dr. Cameron Rais-
ton of the faculty at Washington and
Jefferson College. Delta Tau Delta
will feature Dr. Bernard C. Clausen of
the First Baptist Church at a frater-
nity session.

A calendar o-f all of the meetings,
24 in number, will appear Monday.

Bowman,Trustees
Get SFA Support;
Alliance Rejected

Committees Report To Assembly;
Churchill Presents Resolution
Backing Administration

 

By Chester I-Iarris
_ lligliliglitiiig the Tuesday even-
nig meeting of the Student Fac-
ulty Assembly was the pa.ssa.ge of
a resolution by that body uphold-
ing‘ the stand of (.‘liance1lor John
G. Bowman and the Board of
Trustees of the lliiivcrsity “deny-

ing liberal si1ppx'cssioz‘i at the Uni-

versity. "’

The resolution was introduced by
Robert W. Churchill, C37, and passed
by an overwhelming vote of the as-
sembly. It was intended to correct
any misunderstanding of the stand ‘of
the student body of the recent, charges
Of the DTC-iselit state administration
that the Lniversity has suppressed
freedom of expression.

It was brought out in the meeting
that one of the local papers had pub-
lished 3 CODY of a tele.gram sent by
the Student Alliance, a campus grdup
desirous of obtaining a charter from
the Student Faculty Association
Charging that they were denied a
charter and that the University ad-
ministration had repeatedly “stalled"
regarding their attempts to obtain
one, they went on record as offering
the governor “commendation and all
the support we possess.”

Deny Alliance Charter

A special meeting of the executive
committee of the SFA held \7Vednes-
day aft_ernoon for the ﬁnal consider-
ation of a charter for the Student Al-
liance resulted in the issua.nce of‘a
statement by the committee:

"After careful consideration of the
constitution and after a two-hour dis-
cussion with the chairman of the
Droposed Student Alliance, it is the
unanimous opinion of the Executive
Committee of the Student Faculty As-
sociation that the petition for recogni-
tion of the Student Alliance as an or-
ganization on campus be denied. The
committee believes that the Student
Faculty Ass‘ocia‘tion”“a11d "its various
committees, the Inquiry Forum, the
1'nter—Cultural Associates, and the var-
ious academic clubs and professional
fraternities have programs which
cover all the objectives presented in
the application of the Student Alli-
ance.”

Resolution Adopted

The resolution adopted 'l‘uesd_a_.y
evening by the Student Faculty As-
sembly was declared to represent a.
cross section of student opinion inas-
much as its membership was com-
posed of student representatives. The
resolution read:

Whereas the members of the Stu-
dent Faculty Association object to any
attempt at political influence in the
affairs of the University, '

And whereas the administration of
the University is now giving aid to
hundreds of needy students,

And whereas both the faculty and
students are vitally interested in
whatever affects the welfare of the
University,

Be it resolved, that we, members
of the Student Faculty Association,
express to the Chancellor and mem-
bers of the Board of Trustees our
confidence in their ability to adminis-
ter the affairs of the University to
the best interests of the students, the
faculty, and the citizens. ‘

Regular reports from the commit-
tees took up the greater part of the
meeting.

Calendar Committee Dissolved

The calendar committee, under the
co-chairmanship of Barbara Thomas,
BA37, and D. C. Schultz, BA38, was
dissolved by the assembly. Its duties
will be taken over by. the social com-
mittee.

Dale Van Ormer, EE37, reported
that the work of the organizations
committee is completed. He announc-
ed that the ﬁnal form for general pro-
cedure for obtaining recognition _by
the Student Faculty Association is
completed and ready for distribution.

A report of the ﬁfth hour commit-
tee given by Lois Follansbee, Ed37,
indicated that before the committee
would take any action. the Student
Faculty Survey Committee, consisting
of Herbert Rackotf, C38. and Leonard
Seder, C37. would conduct a student
poll on the question. Roberta Nern,
Ed36, is co-chairman of this commit-
tee.

\ Racusin Reports

David Racusin, C37, reported that
the sub-freshman day committee had
considered May 1 as the most logical
day for this occasion. It was ﬁnally
decided that sub-freshman day should
be held on some other day, by a vote
of the assembly. The reason given
in favor of this vote was that the
student leaders who would be“in
charge of the freshmen would be too
actively engaged in the activity work
of Spring Festival Week to make the
day an enjoyable one for the future
University students. _

A motion to the effect that interest-
ed administration members meet with
the committee relative to choosing
the best possible date was put
through. This came after Racusin
had pointed out that sub-freshman
week required a program of such a.
nature that last-minute plans would
be ineffectual.

Paul Kromer, C37, speaking for the
news reel committee, informed the as-

Attention

 

Copyreaders:
Wednesday's issue of The Pitt News carried the
following insert: “Two years ago Kelly was featured
in the Cap and Gown ‘Hello Again’ as a solo dancer”
. Gene graduated in 1933 and the last show he
appeared in was “All to the Point.” Never even had
anything to do with the “Hello Again” show in any
respect.
Tid-bits
Eddie McCann, Joe Seyler, and Bernie Somers were
bounced out of a ﬁve and dime the other day for sass-
ing the photographer They were cracking wise
when the photograplier said, “Cut it out. You’ll be

Reason Should Be Labor’s
Policy, Fagan Tells Irztyuiry

 

By James Donoghue

“VVe believe in logic and reason.
We do not believe in violence as a
labor policy. VVe don’t think that
you can club a man into organiza-
tion.”

So said P. T. Fagan, president of
District No. 5 of the United Mine
Workers, in a talk before Inquiry
Forum VVednesday on “The Crisis in
the American Labor Movement.”

At the outset of his address Mr.
Fagan sketched the history of the
group he represents and stated that
collective bargaining offers a solu-
tion for some of the most manifest ills
in the United States today.

“There must be shorter hours, high-
er wages, and better working condi-
tions. If labor can organize the large
industries it can point out to employ-
ers that a man has a right to say how

-many hours he shall work and how

much his wages should be.”

Mr. Fagan criticized VVilliam Green,
president of the American Federation
of Labor, for his “stubbornness” in
not taking a more active stand on the
question of industrial unions. Craft
unions, the speaker claimed, have
proved themselves incapable of organ-
izing American labor. Industrial

Bowman, Trustees

unions, however, have demonstrated
that they are adapted to the organi-
zation of labor in mass production in-
dustries. The American Federation
has discouraged the formation of in-
dustrial unions. “We feel that
Green is entitled to his own opinion,
but we have had enough of debate.
We feel that Green should come out
openly for the formation of industrial
unions in the unorganized ﬁelds. The
United‘Mine Workers and'the seven
other industrial unions,” Mr. Fagan
said, “will go forward in their organ-
ization program.”

In the discussion period afterwards
Mr, Fagan was asked why the indus-
trial unions have not made more head-
way than they have.

“The majority of the American Fed-
eration membership is craft union and
they have always been able to outvote
the industrial unionists. We have al-
ways submitted to the majority vote
because we believed in the democratic
process,” Mr. Fagan replied.

When asked why there has been a
lack of labor organizing during recent
years, Mr. Fagan answered “It is not
an easy task to organize a union.”
Propaganda and fear prevent many
workers from joining unions.

sembly of the commIttee’s reasons for
being unable to promote the project
within two months. Kromer stated
that the committee is conducting a
survey in trends in visual education.
This will include the cost of renting
or buying equipment and the possibili-
ties of obtaining a campus building.
’ The commencement commttee. un-
der the direction of Ralph Appel, BA36,
offered seven suggestions for senior
men, including a senior men’s dinner,
senior keys and ties. I

On motion, the assembly decided to
appoint a committee to work with
the Chancellor in arranging for a re-
ception for seniors and their parents.

The book exchange committee, un-
der the co-chairmanship of Chalmers
Brown, E‘d37, and Elinor Scott, Ed37,
reported that it was “still function-
ing” and that they were going ahead
with plans for next year.

Louis Bearer, ChE37, reported that
the student post office committee was
contacting student organizations and
administration offices to‘ obtain esti-

mates of the cost of postage for stu-
dent mail for a year. Members are
also contacting other universities.

Florian C. Majchrzak, ChE37, re-
ported that the transportation com-
mittee had nothing to report beyond
the fact that they had received re-
plies from Mount Mercy College and
Duquesne University stating that
they were in sympathy with the proj-
ect of reducing street car rates.

A report from the peace day com-
mittee stated that the committee of
which Herrymon Maurer, C36,. is
chairman. made no definite arrange-
ments as yet but that they were con-
tacting students and faculty to ﬁnd
out what type of program would be
both “digniﬁed and practical.”

A motion was made to the effect
that the project of frequent Friday as-
semblies be dropped for the present
because of apparent lack of student
interest. Ruth Shapiro, C37, was in
charge of the project.

James Nicholas, ChE3G, reported
that the committee appointed to con-
sider plans for a Men’s Council had
draw up a tentative consitution;

Over-Actors Star
in Arts Pictures

Theda. Bara, Lionel Barrymore
Lead In 1910-Decade Movies

By Sydney IHorovitz

Americans who watch with interest
the stages through which this country
has passed may now ﬁnd pleasure in
turning back to the early moving pic-
ture productions for insight into what:
we have left behind us.

Even as they gloat with just super-
iority over the antiquated, hide-bound.
and moralistic passages of Michael
Wiggleworth’s “Day of Doom” (1662).
now they may giggle and guffaw (or
is it “roll in the aisles?”) over the
sentimentialized, sermonizing pictures
of Frank Powel1’s “A Fool There
Was” (1914), and over others of that
day. But they may also open their
months in astonishment at some evi-
dences of truly artistic direction, act-
ing, and timing and scenery shots.

A sympathetic audience ﬁlled the
auditorium of the :Falk Elementary
School Monday night and projected
themselves back into the period of
“The Rise of the American Film”
from 1908 to 1918.

The audience saw four pictures:
“The New York Hat” (1912) directed
by D. VV. Griffith, with Mary Pickford
and Lionel Barrymore; “The Fugi-
tive” (1916) directed by Thomas H.
Ince, with VVilliam S. ‘Hart and Enid
Markey; “The Clevejr Dumm. ”
(1917), a Mack Sennett comedy with
Ben Turpin, Chester Conklin, and
Xvallace Beery; and “A Fool There
VVas” directed by Powell, with Theda
Bara and Edward Jose.

The ﬁlm which impressed me as
being the most nearly perfect was
“The Fugitive, or The Taking of
Hugh McVane.” Its ruthless realism
carried us from the beginning when
Hart kills a man to save himself and
the girl. to his outlawry and ﬁnal
massacre by the Indians. Hart’s
face is a sure, rigid mask and Miss
Markey emotes with a passionate sen-
SitiVi’CY. The director's hand is shown
in some ﬁne action shots, ﬂashbacks,
and close-ups.

“A Fool There Was” gave cause
for most snickering of superiority.
Its villvainess is a determined she-
devil fatal to all men and the moral
is “Beware!” Miss Bara drops her
iandkerchief at her feet and slinks
at every opportunity.

In “The New York Hat” Griffith at-
tempted to give us intimate pictures
of real human beings. The action is
jerky and the characters mawkish,
but Mary Pickford makes an impres-
sion with small, expressive gestures.

Pitt Track Athletes Await
Start Of Reneﬁt Carnival

 

Potential United States Olympic Team Members To Put
On Show Of Shows In Track House Tomorrow

 

By Edwin H. Beachler
“Sorry,” the Gongloifs, Menakers, Bennetts, Greats, Connell_vs,

and others 1-etorted, “but you see

we just have to show Pittsburgh

that this University will be well represented when the boat carrying
the American team leaves dry dock early i_n July for Berlin.” This

retort almost lowered those raisedeyebrows, almost straightened du-
bious lines that played about the twisted mouth, almost slowed the
laughing chatter of the visitor in the track house.

Tomorrow, several members
Coach Olson's squad of 81 track ti-
tle-aspirants respond to the “gl1T1" On
the ﬁrst lap of the race leading
Olympic-ward. Second to triumphing
individually, the spiked shoe athletes
have the incentive to carry the Pan-
ther colors across the water to the
11th modern revival of the Olympic

Games.
Tomorrow, a group of the ﬁnest

track and ﬁeld stars in University his-
tory competes in The Pitt News Olym-
pic Fund track and ﬁeld meet deter-
mined to prove that plenty of poten-
tial Olympic material resides right
here in the Pittsburgh district.

Opening with an elaborate parade
of officials, court of honor. 00301185,
and contestants, The News Beneﬁt
starts promptly at 1:45 o'clock in the
Track House, atop Trees hill.

Sprinters including Sol Menaker,
come-back star, Dick Mason AMA ti-
titleholder, and Ed Spitz open the
competition in the 50-yard dash on
the east straight-a-way. All running
events will be ﬁnals, eliminating the
usual trial runs.

Connelly-Groat Duel Features

A ﬁag—raising ceremony announces
what Olson) calls the “feature” event,
half-mile duel between Charles Great
and Harold Connelly, outdoor and in-
door champions, respectively, in this
event. Connelly‘ usually holds the In-
dian-sign over Great on the indoor cin-
'ders and present form and condition
makes Harold a slight pre-meet
favorite to continue his dominance. -

Andy Lasky defends his high
hurdles title of 6.9 seconds at 2:25
o’clock, the ﬁfth event on the pro-
gram. Conne1ly’s mark of 212.3 min-
utes very likely will be lowered by
either the record-holder or Great in
this feature event. Walter Good, the
third varsity title-holder, aims to
lower his 42-foot mark in the hop,
step and jump. Good streched out to
44.2 feet in the recent University——

sponsored AMA meet, bettering «his-

old mark by two feet.

Thomas, lead-off man on the relay
team, stands a good chance of ap-
proaching Freddie Kiger’s 53-second
standard in the quarter. The speedy
sophomore has already turned in
faster times in this event than Kig-
er’s mark.

Red Tost dominates the varsity
milers but will have to step plenty to
get near VVagenhouser’s 1935 record-
Alex Leggin, according to Olson,
might possibly surprise in the two-
mile run.

lnterfraternity Relay Added

Pete Bennett, sophomore sensation,
and Redmond Oden are scheduled to
attempt their record-breaking efforts
previous to the actual Olympic cere-
monies that officially open the meet,
Both the yearling and varsity high
jumps will be run off at 1315 0'C10Ck-
Pole vaulters will also vie at this early
time to clear the inside arena for the
spectators.

‘Neight men wind up the elaborate
program in the ﬁnal 35-pound weight
3:45 o’clock, Maximum
running time for the entire meet will
be 2 hours and 30 minutes.

\Vith the donation of a silver
trophy by the Tremen-King Company,
dealers in sporting goods, a special
one-mile fraternity relay has been
added to the program. A silver run-
ner is mounted on the black base of
this 13-inch award which will be PI_‘e-
sented to the winner of The;'P1tt
News Special ‘Greek relay event.

Due to the late arrival of the
trophy, there will be no deadline set
as to the time entries must be ﬁled
for the Fraternity relay champion-
ship run. Entries will be received by
winiam lHousel, C37, Harry’ Zinss_er,
C37, co-chairman of Interfraternlty
athletics, or Carl Olson, varsity track
coach, in the Stadium office. The
special Greek event has been sched-
uled for 2:35 o’clock. .

James Potts, assistant coach and
ticket chairman of the beneﬁt, re-
ports that over 650 tickets have al-
ready been sold for tomorrow’s meet.

Everyone Will Pay

On the general committee in
charge of The Pitt News show are:
Carl Olson, James Potts, coaches;
W. Don Harrison; Jlames Hagan,
graduate manager of athletics; Frank
,Carver; R. X. Graham, director of
University news service; ‘Walter
Ridley; and The News representa-
tives Charles Ruch, editor, Harry
«Robinson, sports editor, Bill Trosen.
and Edwin Beachler, chairman.

VV. Don Harrison will act as honor-
ary referee while Dr. John Bain Suth-

erland holds the _job of referee.
Charles Gongloff will be head ﬁeld
judge.

Tickets may be procured from mem-
bers of the varsity and freshman
track teams, Coaches Olson and Potts
at the Stadium oﬁice, or the Sports
Staff of The Ne_\_VS.

The meet will be unusual in that
even the competitors, coaches offic-
ials, in fact anyone connected with the
championship event will pay an entry
fee or buy a ticket. Tickets sell for
26 cents, with an established entry
fee of ten cents for each entrant."

Swimmers Seek
Fourth Straight

Meet State I Natators Tomorrow
Afternoon In Dual Encounter

A cavalcade of automobiles bearing
a squad of Panther swimmers will
leave Pittsburgh early tomorrow
morning for State College, where
Coach Pat Corr’s varsity team will
clash with Penn State's newly formed
aggregation in the afternoon. The
Pitt outﬁt will be seeking its fourth
straight victory in dual competition.

Coach Corr plans to use his strong-
est lineup in an effort to keep the win
streak intact. Captain Russ Lindberg,
who ha.s been a consistent point win-
ner in the sprint events, will prob-
ably be shifted to the 200-yard back-
stroke due to the loss of Joe Jones.
He will also be used in the 50-yard
free style along with Harry Geyer.

In the distance events Tom Locke
and Jimmy Lavine will likely get the
nod, and Anderson and Stiranko will
start in the 220-yard breaststroke.
Prince and Geyer in the century event
and McQuil1an and Myers in the fancy
complete the individual entry list.

In the relay competition Coach Corr
will choose his starting quartet from
Heuple, Prince, Lindberg, Locke, and
Geyer.

Three Bowling Teams
Tied For First Place

Rolling out a 2-1 decision over
Lambda Chi Alpha, the Phi Kappas
knocked League A of the Interfrater-
nity Bowling Tou_rnament into a
t.hree-way deadlock Tuesday night.
Delta Tau Delta also contributed its
share to the tie by taking three games
from the Pi Lamsv and putting itself
in the ﬁrst-place brigade.

After taking the ﬁrst game. the Phi
-Kappas dropped the second to the
Lambda Chis, leaving their fate in the
tournament to the result of the ﬁnal
game. Spurred by this incentive they
turned on the power to score the
toui-nament’s high point total with a
record of 819 points and earn a play-
off chance with Lambda Chi Alpha
and Delta Tau Delta.

Stoeklem paced the winning Phi
Kappas with a 190 score after he was
inserted as a substitute.

Although losing, 2-1, to Pi Kappa Al-
pha Wednesday night, the Phi Delts
remained champions of League B.
Their ﬁrst _ place ' superiority only
showed a margin of one game over
PiKA in a hotly-contested_league race.
The Phi Delts were In-terfraternity
Champs lastyear when they defeated
Phi Kappa in the league play-offs and
they earned the right to defend this
title by virtue of their League B win.

iympic Meet To 

fPanthers 50 East

F or League Clash
With Temple Owls

Heading into the home stretch of
the Eastern Intercollegiate Confer-
ence schedule, Pitt’s Golden Panther
basketeers are afforded a grand
chance to climb in the league stand-
ing tonight when they battle Temp1e’s
second-place Owls in Philadelphia.

As a result of Temple's win over
Penn State and Georgetown whipping
‘Vest Virginia on Tuesday night, the
Panthers now rest in third place all
alone. By giving the right stuff to the
Owls this evening, Dr, Carlson’s boys
will languish only one-half game be-
hind the two present leaders, Carne-
gie Tech and Georgetown. From
there, all the Panthers have to do is
to win the remainder of their confer-
ence games and they will be assured
of at least a tie when the ﬁnal stand-
ing is computed.

Getting back to tonigl1t’s game, how-
ever, the Panthers will have to show
a great improvement in their recent
playing if they want to get past those
Owls. Temple has made a reputation
of being plenty tough on their own
ﬂoor. Last season Pitt, Tech, and
West Virginia were all whipped by
Temple on the their slippery, band-
box pavilions. Yet each of these teams
shellacked the Owls on their own
home ﬂoor.

Of the ﬁve players starting for Tem-
ple no fewer than four saw action
against the Panthers last year. Two
of them, v.Lou Dubin and Steve Juenger,
will be at forwards, the other two W111
perform at the ghard positions in the
persons of ‘Ernie Messikomer and Ed
The only new man starting
will be Jimmy Bloom, a sophomore
center. Lou Dubin, the senior for-
ward, was theboy who rattled off 20
points against the State Lions this
week.

The Panther party left last night for
Philadelphia with ten varsity men
making the weekend trip.

Hoping to retain the ﬁne form they
showed in their recent engagement
with Wl&J, Panther boxers will depart
tomorrow morning for~\Vashington, D.
C., where they will encounter the
strong Catholic U team in a. match
tomorrow night.

One of the highlights of the en-
counter will be the debut of Frank
Patrick, Pitt grid star, in collegiate
boxing. Patrick will be entered in
the heavyweight division.

Coach Jack Schricker is undecided
whether he will use Russ Vogel or
Dick =Conti in the 115-pound class.
Both men are experienced, but Vogel
has been the most active this season.

In the 125-pound class Coach
Schricker will use the dependable Al
Paslowski. Abe Konick again will
draw the 135-pound assignment, while

John Stronko will represent the Blue
and Gold in the 145-pound division.

George Dines will again throw
hooks and jabs in the 155-pound class
and in the 165-pound class Schricker
will use Art Leonard. Cleon Linderman
will climb through the ropes when the
175-pounders are announced, and
Frank Patrick will start in the heavy-
weight division for the ﬁnal match of
the evening.

The Flying Cardinals recently
trounced the Carnegie Tech boxers,
7-1. The Panther boxing team .has won
one, lost one, and tied one for their
season’s total.
