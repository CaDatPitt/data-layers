economists:
long-term
aid solution
to recession

By Michael King
Stajf Writer

The government needs to enact
long-term, economic-growth
policies to pull the country out of
the current recession, according
to Pitt economists.

During a panel discussion at
the Law School yesterday Dr.
Mark Perlman, Dr. David Huston,
Dr. RuebeneSlesinger and Dr.
David Dejong, all economics
professors‘ at Pitt, agreed that
recovery from therecession will
not be easy but solutions must be
initiated imminently.

“We have to create a market
that is conducive to long-term
growth,” Dejong said.

He said this can be done by
maintaining price stability,
investing government funds in
education, limiting competition
in the private sector and
maintaining openness to free
trade.

International trade openness
is, “a necessary condition for
maintaining the intake of
technically innovative goods,"
Dejong said. 7

According to Dejong, a good
solution would be to de-
emphasize policies designed to
reverse the current downstream
and concentrate on policies
stressing long-term growth.

“Short—term solutions will be
much more painful  it would be
better to turn to diplomacy than
to erect trade barriers,” Dejong
said.

Perlman said the United States
government must re-examine its
spending and invest in projects

that will result in internal
solutions.

A presidential task force has announced it
will attempt to combat the abuse of alcohol
on college campuses in Pennsylvania.

The Presidential Task Force On Substance
Use Issues On Pennsylvania College And
University Campuses was formed by the
Pennsylvania Association .of Colleges and
Universities two years ago.

According to PACU President Gary Young,
the task force’s objective “is to incorporate
into the campuses practices that will lead to
the safest, healthiest environment for students
by [the year] 2000."

In an 80-plus page report entitled “Drugs
On Campus At The Bimillennium,” the task
force suggested that colleges and universities
prohibit brewery-company advertising or
sponsorship of events on their campuses,
including sporting events.

“Such sponsorship directly promotes use
and indirectly fosters the belief that alcohol
and sports are naturally related,” according to
the report.

Another suggestion in the report is for the

Taskfdrcestudiesalcobol abuse on campus

federal government to exert control over the
advertising of alcoholic beverages on radio
and television.

The task force wants advertising to be
regulated to conform with new, approved
standards. The Wine Institute and the Century
Council have already adopted these standards,
which are “generally practiced for wines but
not for beer or wine coolers," the report said.

“Alcohol is the most widely used ‘drug of
choice’ on college campuses today,” said Dr.
Peter Linkins, task force chair and president
of Lehigh University.

“Alcohol is an underlying inﬂuence in most
acts of vandalism and violence, including
rape, on college campuses,” Linkins said.

He added that alcohol was the “incipient
cause of death in automobile and other
accidents for college youths.”

The report also called on the state to ban
the retail sale of pure grain alcohol. “There is
no legitimate need for the general public to
have ready access to a drug used primarily by
college students to ‘spike the punch,”’ the
report said.

The task force, which is believed to have
done the first statewide study of drug abuse

on college campuses, is made up of college
and university presidents, state government
officials from both theexecutive and legislative
branches and several treatment professionals
who focus on substance abuse.

“It’s not just a group of college officials,"
Young said. “The~state government came to
IPACUI with the problem.”

According to Young, this problem was
informally endorsed by James Goodman,
who is the chairperson of Pennsylvania’s
Liquor Control Board.

Young said the task force “represents a
very helpful collaboration of higher education
with oflicials of the state government and the
professionals of the substance-abuse treatment
community."

The task force recommended that each
campus develop a Coordinated Primary
Prevention Program, which would establish
an interdisciplinary group responsible for
developing and implementing a
comprehensive alcohol and drug program..

The program would also require all students
and employees to have inexpensive health
insurance that will cover standard drug and
alcohol treatment.

Exposure to deadly carbon monoxide often untreated

By Vincent Gadrix
For The Pitt News

Although it is virtually undetectable,
carbon monoxide gas is one of the most
deadly gases on earth. In 1990, 7,557
people were exposed to carbon monoxide
poisoning, 26 of whom died, according to
Dr. Vincent Verdile, director of the
emergency department at Presbyterian
University Hospital.

Despite the increase in carbon monoxide
exposures during the winter, Verdile said
there are many year—round exposures.

“The classic example is when people
inhale smoke and fumes that are heavily

laden with carbon monoxide in house
ﬁres,” he said.

Verdile said people can also be exposed
when using paint stripper. Verdile said
paint stripper contains methylene chloride,
a chemical that goes through the skin and

is converted to carbon monoxide in the '

body. Exposures also occur when internal
combustion engines, such as those in fork
lifts, are not properly ventilated.

The seasonal increase in the exposures
is usually attributed to fumace malfunctions
in which the gas is not burned effectively.
Carbon monoxide is an odorless, tasteless,
colorless gas. Exposure causes headache,
dizziness and nausea. As concentration of

gas and exposure time increase, the first
symptoms can include irregular breathing,
unconsciousness and ultimately death.

Verdile said researchers estimate that
there are probably 5,000 unreported cases
a year. “It is based on situations such as
when a patient comes to the emergency
room in cardiac arrest, you try to resuscitate
them and you may not think if it is related
to carbon monoxide," he said.

“Another is that you might find someone
in a park drinking beer in their car, and the
car's running. The person passes out and
dies, and you really don't think if it's
carbon monoxide or a suicide attempt.
You do not entertain the thou ght of possible

exposure," he said. “Even though it is the
number one lethal poison in the country,
it is still very much underreported."

Verdile is also the director of the
hyperbaric medicine program at the
hospital, which treats patients who have
been exposed to carbon monoxide.

The treatment involves oxygen therapy
in a Hyperbaric chamber.

The more oxygen patients receive, the
faster the carbon monoxide is cleared
from their system.

This reduces the chances for long-term
health problems, which include chronic
headaches, attention deficits and
personality disorders.

Students, faculty and staff offer ways to cut budget

By Catherine Goldstein
stag Writer

Pitt administrators have recently
been criticized by students and
faculty for excessive spending,
including the $92,000 installation
of President J. Dennis O'Connor
and a $50,000 business trip to the
Grand Cayman Islands. Business
ventures such as the Copy Cat
and the Pittsburgh Shop have
also angered some members of
the university community.

In a time of economic need,

students and faculty offer some’

ideas to help the university make
budget cuts.

Senior Sheri Gusavage said
spending should be cut in the
athletics program, including
recruitment.

She suggested the university
channel these funds into other
areas. -

“They should spend more time
and money improving the dorms
we already have instead of
building new ones. Also, they
should do something about

-SGB member Bryan Bender

 ”

transportation because it’s so bad
and there’s so much crime,”
Gusavage said.

Debate coach and
communications Professor Arnold
Madsen said that if increases in
spending occur they should
redirect funds into the academic
mission of the university."

He said that if cuts in spending
were to be made, they should not
effect anything directly related to
education.

Some of his cuts included
administrative costs, Copy Cat or
the Pittsburgh Shop.

Madsen also suggested the
university stop buying real estate.

“Buying land in the area or a
building simply because it’s
available seems frivolous to me.

Instead of buying a building, they
could ldo some] remodeling in
the Cathedral of Learning. Money
spent on things not directly related
to the educational mission could
and should be cut," Madsen said.

Senior Melissa Weitz said she
also feels that spending should
go directly to the students, but
only the students at Pitt, not those
in the Study Abroad program.

“There should be more money
available for ﬁnancial aid and
less for Study Abroad and students
from other schools. There are so
many students who are struggling
to pay for college; instead of
raising our tuition by $1 for Study
Abroad, why don't they do that
so more people can get ﬁnancial
aid?” Weitz said.

Other students were more
concerned with budget cuts that
have already taken effect.

Student Government Board
member Derrick St. Clair said he
is upset about the Department of
Public Safety’s budget cuts.

“Students are concerned about
safety, and the fact that their
budget is being cut year after
year makes it harder for them to
work with the students and vice
versa. [SGB] has all of these
projects we want to work on
jointly with them, but it’s difficult
when they have little funds to
work with?” he said.

St. Clair also expressed his
concern regarding the
astronomical prices at the book
center.

“They have huge amounts of
money in profits just sitting there.
The university is here to offer us
an education, not buy up
everything in Oakland,” he said.

“This is an institution of higher
learning, not a Fortune 500
company,” SGB member Bryan
Bender said.

Pitt Sign Connection bosts
annual talent competition

By Lori Bosert
Sta_[)"W1-lter

Over 100 Pitt sign language
students proved to their audience
last night that there is more than
one way to sing a song.

In the annual Sign Connection
Talent Show, held in the William
Pitt Union, students danced, acted
and signed their favorite songs.

“It encourages my students ‘to
open a new avenue of
communication other than the
spoken word,” said Karen Walkey,
sign language instructor. “And they
have fun.”

Some of the evening’s highlights
included a rendition of “I Got No
Strings,” from Pinocchio, an
acrobatic interpretation of
Madonna’s “Express Yourself“ and
a comical rendition of two songs
from the musical Snoopy.

“Songs should be up-tempo and
with enough dialogue to split
between the students,” said Mark

l Olenjacz, whose group won first place

for “Homecoming Queen's Got A
Gun."

‘All of the students enrolled in
Pitt’s sign language program
participated.

According to Walkey, the students
choose the songs early in the term to
give themselves enough time to
translate them properly.

She said the translation process can
be long because English doesn’t
always parallel American Sign
Language.

For example, explained student
Danielle Smith, the group who
performed “I Can’t Say No,” signed
“Say no Can’t me.”

“In ASL, the words are moved in a
way that deaf people can understand,"
Smith said.

The panel of judges, half of whom
were deaf, judged acts on presentation
and sign language skills.

“I’m looking at hand signs and
expression of their hands as ASL,”
said judge Suzanne Muszynski.

Perlman said.

change policies in the government.

“We have to think of our economy as undergoing

Slesinger said that over the past decade, America has '

seen a decrease in total work hours, a decrease in the

length of the work week, an increase in the number of .

jobs lost and no gain in the hourly wage rate since
1972.

He said, “No new president or his policies will get us
out of the recession  those policies are all reflective of
special interest groups.”

Slesinger agreed with the other panelists in that long-
term goals spawn a growing economy, but he added,
“In a growing economy recovery is easier, but the

_suffering of the people is the same.” ~

Bigot coach is shame

Last year, when Penn State women’s basketball Coach
Rene Portland hunted and ostracized perceived lesbians
and bisexual women on her team, university officials
were forced to confront anti-gay prejudice among their
ranks. Portland dismissed women from her basketball
team solely on the basis that she thought they were
lesbians. Penn State took action to remedy the situation.

Yet when the interests of big money come in conflict
with anti-bias commitment, universities scramble for
apologies or take no action at all. University of Colorado
Coach Bill McCartney shook up the school last week with
a gay-bashing diatribe. ‘

A few months ago, McCartney lent his name and
university title to an anti-gay organization seeking to
repeal a state law that barred discrimination on the basis
of sexual orientation. After complaints, McCartney violated
a Colorado University policy that prohibits employees
from using their school association for personal causes.
McCartney agreed to announce at a news conference his
assurance that the anti-gay organization would not use his
name and affiliation in the future.

Instead of keeping his word at the press conference,
McCartney came out to oppose the state law. During his
highly charged speech, he degraded and defamed gay,
lesbian and bisexual men and women, condemning gays
to hell. He said homosexuals “are a group of people who
don't reproduce, yet want to be compared with people
who do reproduce.” For McCartney, only people who
breed deserve respect.

Of course, McCartney has the right to free speech.
However he defied the university president by using the
school’s facilities and name to promote his agenda. In fact,
draped in front of his podium, the school letters appeared
for the cameras. McCartney has a right to disagree with
civil-rights legislation and to speak out publicly. We also
have a right to call him an anti-gay bigot.

It should be noted, however, that the American Civil
Liberties Union had to take McCartney to court in 1984
over a ritual he required of student athletes. McCartney
forced players to pray before games. Forcing individuals
to adhere to a religious creed sounds like the politically
correct “thought police” in action.

University President Judith Albi-no responded (as she
should) that she has “great concern and compassion for
all students and other members of this learning community
who feel hurt, confused and intimidated by this incident.
In that regard, I will do everything in my power to ensure
that discrimination against any individual does not occur
at the University of Colorado.”

McCartney violated school trust initially by violating its
rules about using the university's name for pet, homophobic
projects. Secondly, he used the press conference to bash
gays. Thirdly, McCartney's hate undoubtedly intirnidates
gay and bisexual men in the Colorado University sports
programs. McCartney’s actions warrant dismissal.
Unfortunately, the university will not take action due to
his success as a coach. Once again, universities compromise
supposed values to prop up role models of prejudice and

hate.

Corporate execz/rm/es inejficient, lazy

I know what you’re thinking.
You're sitting back in your easy
chair, cursing the Japanese under
your breath for their role in the
destruction of the United States’

economy. ,
Well, I have news for you. The
Japanese have become

scapegoats for our own economic
woes. American big business and

the national media have A
- seemingly launched a campaign

to influence American public
opinion against Japan.

Despite these efforts, however,
Japan isn't completely responsible
for our import—export problems
— particularly in the automobile
industry, which is usually the
primary focus of this
campaign.

Following President George
Bush's recent trip to Asia, the
response of American big-
business leaders and the coverage
of the national media would lead
one to believe that the business
practices of the Japanese are to
blame for the economy's
difﬁculties.

This has resulted in an
unfortunate and embarrassing‘
epidemic of anti-Japanese
sentiment across the country.

There are gasoline stations
offering discounts to customers
driving American-made cars.
Companies are offering cash
incentives to employees who
purchase American-made cars.
People have been picketing
Japanese car dealerships,
encouraging potential car buyers
to boycott Japanese cars and buy
American-made cars

In addition, one car dealer has
an offer whereby if customers
test drive an American-made
truck, then they earn the right to
strike aJapanese—made truck with
a sledgehammer.

After meeting with Bush, Japan
offers to attempt to change its
import-export practices in order
to assist America’s failing
economy, and our nation
responds gratefully by taking out
its aggressions on a pick-up truck.

Bush took prominent business
leaders to Japan with him,

including the chief executive

officers of the Big Three auto
makers.

During discussions between the
leaders ofJapanese and American
car companies, both parties were
given the opportunity to ask

David
Matta

questions about the other’s
business strategies.

The Americans asked questions
and were often not satisfied with
the answers because they were
not the answers that they were
looking for.

For instance, when Chrysler
CEO Lee Iacocca and the other
CEOs asked the Japanese about
how they keep their companies
running so successfully, one of
the answers they got was that
they keep their executives’ salaries
down and concentrate on putting
money back into their co-
mpanies. v

They also keep their employees
happy by promoting and
rewarding them for their loyalty
and service.

Iacoccawas not satisfied with
the response because he was
searching for another reason, so
he proceeded to inquire about
other aspects of the Japanese car
industry. The answer was right
there, but he refused to listen to
it because it did not serve his own
best interests.

Japanese executives make
about $300,000 a year and are
taxed approximately 65 percent
of that amount.

The Big Three CEOs make
about $4 million a year before
bonuses and beneﬁts, which can
double their salaries, and are taxed
approximately 25 percent of that
amount.

They also receive raises when
employees are forced to take pay
cuts or are laid off. So much for
the idea of promoting and
rewarding employee loyalty and
service. And now there are rumors
floating around the business

world that Lee Iacocca is thinking
about retiring from Chrysler after
he brought it back from
bankruptcy because the 0 co-
mpany is taking a downward
turn again‘.

Now let’s see.  leader who
comes to an organization and
brings it back from the dead by
building it into a major force,‘
only to leave when the
organization starts to slide
again. Remind you of anyone we
know? ,

Despite the distinct differences
that exist between the car
industries of the two countries,
surely the suggestions of the
Japanese about .specific
differences in business practices
could be a large cause of the
problems. .

The Japanese are aware of some
of the difﬁculties facing American
car makers. However when they
point them out to the'Americans,
they're told that they're on the
wrong track.

Some Americans do seem to
agree that some of the problems
lie with the executives of
American companies. When a
Japanese official recently
criticized American workers for
being lazy and inefficient, the
nation was outraged, and this
contributed to the rash" of anti-
Japanese sentiment.

An American official, however,
spoke up recently and stated that
the Japanese official was wrong
about the workers and that they
were some of, if not, the best in
the world. Instead, he said, it's
the executives of American
companies who aren't effective
in their positions and who are
paid too much money for their
efforts.

Perhaps if we could all agree
on the right answers to our
questions, then we could go about
finding and enacting solutions to
our economic problems.

Pointing fingers at theJapanese
will serve nothing but to strain
relations with a valuable
economic ally.

Pitt football head coach Paul
Hackett announced the hiring
of two new assistant coaches
and the promotion of two
current assistants yesterday.

Secondary coach Nick
Rapone retains his duties but
assumes the role of defensive
coordinator, while inside
linebackers coach Sal Sunseri
has been named assistant head
coach. ‘

Rapone, a Pitt graduate
assistant in 1979-’80, is in his
third season as a Pitt assistant.
He has been a defensive
coordinator at East Carolina
and Temple in the past.

“This move will allow us to
build on our current base 3-4
defensive scheme,” Hackett
said. “I feel we’ve laid a good
foundation on defense, and
now we will be able to move

expectations.”

Sunseri is a former Pitt All-
American linebacker and has
been on the coaching staff as
either a graduate assistant or
position coach since 1984.
According to Hackett, Sunseri
will now assume an
administrative role on the
coaching staff as well.

“Sal Sunseri has been totally

forward with even greater

assistant coaches

committed to the University of
Pittsburgh and has made a
dramatic impact here as a
player, as an alumnus and as a
coach," Hackett said.

The two new assistants are
Amos Jones, who will coach
special teams and be a
defensive assistant, and Brian
Williams, who will coach the
outside linebackers. Jones
coached special teams at
Alabama for the last two years,
and he previously coached at
Temple. Jones played at ‘Bama
from 1977—’80.

The 27-year-old Williams was
responsible for the outside
linebackers at Pacific for the
last three years. He played his
college ball at Kentucky from
1983-86.

Amos and Williams replace
departed assistants Jon Gruden
and Marvin Lewis, while
Rapone will fulﬁll part of Fred
Von Appen’s duties. Von
Appen, who was also defensive
line coach, took a position at
Stanford under Bill Walsh.

Hackett said he hopes to
complete his staff by next week,
including naming several
offensive coaches and a
replacement for Von Appen as
defensive line coach.

Boston College ﬂogs Lady

By Rob Mazur
Sports Editor

One word describes last night's
Lady Panther basketball game
against the Boston College Eagles
— ugly.

The Eagles (5-19 overall, 3-12
in the Big East) needed the 29
points they got from star guard
Sarah Behn to snap their nine-
game losing streak with a 76-63
win over Pitt (9-15 overall, 5-10
in the conference).

“They’re always ugly when you
lose, and you tend to forget the
bad things when you win,” Lady
Panther head coach Kirk Bruce
said.

The Lady Panthers shot 35
percent from the ﬂoor. Guard
Erin Maloy scored 12 points but
was 5-14 from the floor and 2-10
from three-point land. Forward
Jill Colabrese scored 10 points
before fouling out with 2:56 to
play but was a frigid 3-17 from
the hardwood.

“Jill and Erin were taking some
shots that they were open on and
normally would have made if we
weren’t down by as much as we
were,” Bruce said. “Those were
shots they always take, and if we
had been closer, they might have
made those shots.”

Boston College dominated most
of the game. After it was tied at
two points a side, the Eagles
pulled away to take a nine-point,

 

Jason Hillman/The Pitt News

BC's Sarah Behn (right) scored 29 points in last night's Eagle victory.

44-35 lead into the locker room.
Pitt came out and tied the game
at 54 with 9:34 left. However the
Eagles quickly re-extended their
lead to four points.

Then, with Boston College
leading 60-56 at the 6:28 mark,
Pitt guard Jill McElhinny was
whistled with the team’s first
technical foul of the year.
McElhinny had picked up a loose
ball when two Eagles players
trapped her on the sideline. After
the referee called a jump ball,
McElhinny slammed the ball to
the court, which resulted in the
technical.

The following free throws and
possession netted Boston College
an eight-point lead and squelched
what little hope the Lady Panthers

had left.

The Eagles successfully
accomplished what few teams
have this season by allowing Pitt's
Jonna Huemrich only, 13 points
and four rebounds. After picking
up two fouls early in the first half,
Huemrich played tentatively for
the rest of the game, never getting
into the rhythm that has led to her
17-point average.

One disparity that clearly hurt
Pitt was the number of fouls
called in the second half. The
Lady Panthers were called for 15
violations, while Boston College
only received six whistles.

That resulted in 17 second-half
free throws for the Eagles as
opposed to Pitt's five total
attempts.

Swimmers await Big East Championships

Panthers  

1 Men“ favorites

to clinch tenth

straight crown  

By Jim Lakely
Stat)" Writer

As the Pitt men's swim team looks ahead
to the Big East Championship this weekend,
the question in head coach Chuck Knoles’
mind is not whether it will win, but by how
much.

“I think that if these guys get into the fun
of swimming fast, we will add more than
100 points to last year’s winning margin
last year,” he said. “That is how confident
I am in these guys.

“This meet should be a lot of fun,”
Knoles said, “and we spell fun F-A-S-T.”

Last year, Pitt fought off a late Villanova
rally to win by 100 points, so Knoles’
prediction for this year tells as much about
the Panthers’ squad as it tells about the rest
of the conferenoe.Barring a Pitt catastrophe,
Villanova, Miami and Syracuse will be
battling for second place. Plagued with
injuries, sickness and academic-eligibility
problems, Villanova should not pose a
serious challenge to Pitt.

Miami and Syracuse share the same
strengths and liabilities. Both schools have
superstars on their squads, but their overall
team depth is suspect. And both teams will
have trouble beating Pitt’s freestylers,
according to Knoles. Syracuse gave Pitt
one of its toughest meets back in
November. The Panthers squeaked by,
124-119, butwhat would seem to be a
legitimate challenge to the Panthers is
dismissed by Knoles.

I

“If they are as strong here as they were
at the dual meet, we will be in for a ﬁght,”

he said, “but I just don't think they can‘

hang with us in a championship meet.”

All year long, Pitt has been outclassing
its opponents on account of its experience
(eight seniors) and, of course, its talent. A
rested, shaved and tapered Pitt squad is
strong enough to challenge any team in
the nation, and its 23rd ranking proves
that. In fact, this is the first Pitt team in
history to ﬁnish the season ranked in the
top 25. -

“It looks funny, doesn't it?" Knoles said.
“Seeing that name on the list just looks
funny — like a typo —- like it really
shouldn’t be there, but it is."

Some of the swimmers who helped Pitt
attain its first ranking in recent memory
will be the swimmers to watch in this
year’s championship meet. Don Boyd,

who has qualified for the Olympic trials,

along with Joe Kozlina, is the favorite to
win the 100- and 200-yard breastsroke.
Matt Brady is expected to do well in the
100 and 200 back in his own quest for an
Olympic shot. Kozlina and Big East 50-
yard record holder Eric Cornell look to
dominate the freestyle. For David Schepner
and Jonti Bacharach, this meet could
essentially be a swim-off for a spot on the
800 free-relay teamin the NCAA qualifying
meet.Other Panthers slated to do well this
weekend include Eric Mattson, the “hands-
down favorite” in the 400 individual
medley, according to Knoles. A well-
rested Kevin McLaughlin's chances in the
200 breaststroke improve because of his
absence in this year’s 200 ﬂy. And a
determined Matt Porter should score points
in the 50, 100 and 200 free.

“Everyone has the potential to finish in
the top eight in every event they swim,"
Knoles said.

Miami, ’NoVa
big opponents

for women
By Brian Gallagher
stajrtvruer v

This weekend's women's swim meet at
Trees Pool is “officially” dubbed the Big
East Swimming and Diving
Championships. And “officially" there are
10 teams vying for the right to be called
league champs. But as any third-grade
teacher will tell you, don't believe
everything you read.

While it certainly won’t be as predictable
as in previous years, when Pitt was head
and shoulders above the competition,
there are some absolutes in this year’s
meet. Simply put, the 1991-’92 women's
Big East Championship will come down to
one of three teams: Pitt, Miami of Florida
and Villanova.

One look at the meet seedings will
further amplify the disparity between the
“Big Three" and the rest of the field. Of the
40 events slated to take place, all 40 first
seeds are occupied by athletes from the
“Big Three” schools.

While the psych (seeding) sheet is not a
totally accurate barometer of what will
happen come showtime, it does give an
indication of what to generally anticipate,
according to Pitt head coach David
Belowich.

“[The psych sheet] has some credence in
that the swimmers get to compare
themselves with the competition,"
Belowich said, adding that the difference
in times between the top seeds are too
small to assume that the top-seeded team

will automatically win.

“What you'll see this weekend is people
coming from seventh or eighth place to
win an event," Belowich said.

Perhaps the biggest surprise in this meet
to swimming outsiders is the fact that Pitt
is not favored to win its 10th-straight title.
In addition to facing formidable foes like
Villanova and Miami at this year’s meet,
Pitt is coming off a subpar dual-meet
season (5-5) filled with injuries and
departures. Despite these factors weighing
against the team, Pitt’s chances are anything
but hopeless.

The most important positive for Pitt is
that the team is shaved, tapered and
healthy. The fact that the team is peaking,
combined with a team attitude described
by Belowich as “marvelous” could propel
Pitt into contention.

“I really think that the team is ready to
swim better than they ever have -
collectively and individually. If they do
that, we're gonna score well and be right
in there [for first placel.”

Pitt’s strength lies in its divers and team
balance. While the Panthers boast only
one first seed (Chr_isty Knobloch, 200
butterﬂy), they have several swimmers
(Candie Burke, Jen Burns, Laura-Lee
Sullivan, Janine Atiyeh, Clare McShane)
within striking distance of pulling out
upset victories.

While Belowich is excited about how
his team will fare, he and Miami head
coach Richard Cahalan both point to
Villanova as favorites to win the meet
outright.

“Villanova’s solid all the way through,”
Belowich said. “They are prohibitively the
favorites." .

A big part of the Wildcats success this
season has been the dominance of Lisa

See Women, page 14

 

“Women

Continued from page 13
Flood. The sophomore
breaststroke specialistis seeded
first in four individual events

this weekend although she can «

only participate in three. Flood
holds meet records in the 100-
and 200-yard breast stroke.

In addition to the talents of
Flood, ‘Nova - boasts
tremendous depth in the
freestyle. The trio of Mary
Dowling, Sarah Dykstra and
Meaghan McCaffrey ﬁgure to
finish at the top of nearly every
freestyle event.

If Villanova has an Achilles’
heel, it’s their divers. Entering
the Big East meet for the first
time, Wildcat divers do not
ﬁgure to contribute signiﬁcantly
to the team's point total. For
this reason, Miami and its
brilliant divers could overcome

‘Nova’s deﬁciency to take ﬁrst
place, according to Villanova
head coach Chuck Horton.

“Last year's meet [won by
Pitt] was decided by the divers, "
Horton said. “If that happens
again this year, Miami has the
advantage."

Entering their ﬁrst Big East
meet, Miami’s strength lies in
its divers (three All—Americans),
relays (first seeds in all meet
relays) and freestyle events.

For Belowich, while the
prospect of surrendering the
league crown is more prevalent
than ever, the improved
competition in the conference
will prove beneficial in
improving Panther swimming.

“It’s gonna be the fastest meet
in the history of the meet,"
Belowich said. “lt’s gonna be
fun.”

Cruz Conﬁdent in diving abilities

By Missi DiNardo
For The Pm News

Phil Cruz, one of Pitt's top
divers, hopes to place in the top
ﬁve at the Big East meet this
weekend.. Cruz is a strong,
confident and very disciplined
diver who sets goals and is
determined to reach them.

Cruz became involved with
diving through gymnastics. He
started gymnastics when he was
seven years old and continued it
until the seventh grade, when he
sustained a shoulder injury.

“After the injury I shied away

from gymnastics,” Cruz said.

“Then I started competing in high
school, but since it was only one
season I carried what I knew
from gymnastics into diving.”
Although he really never had a
diving coach, he managed to

THE PITI‘ NEWS, Thursday, February 20, 1992

capture second place in district
competition during his junior and
senior years. Cruz also went to
state competition.

“I promised myself that I wasn’t
going to dive in college unless I

“had a coach,” Cruz said. After

looking into several colleges, as
well as coaches, Cruz felt that Pitt
was the right choice. “Pitt has a
good reputation for producing
top divers, and all of the hospitals
in the area intrigued me because
of my interest in health-related
ﬁelds,” he said.

His hard work and extreme
dedication during his ﬁrst year
led to an impressive sophomore
year. He placed third on both the
1- and 3-meter boards in the Big
East and placed in the top 16 at
Easterns. In his junior year he
again took third on the 1- and 3-
meter boards in the Big East. He

placed in the top 14 at Easterns.
He advanced to NCAA
prequalifications, where he
placed third on the 1-meter, which
lead him to Nationals.

“I feel I have progressed as a
diver over the past four years,”
Cruz said. “My mechanics have
gotten better, and I broke a lot of
bad habits.

“There is a special bond
between the diving team," he
said. “I really enjoy being around
the team. We are really close, and
that is what makes us so strong.
Also, the coaches are very
positive, which is a big plus.”

Teammate Chris Mahr said,
“Phil is very inspiring to be
around. He is a solid diver and
knows a lot about diving. He
really helps the team out a lot.”

Pitt diving coach Julian Krug
said, “Phil is an absolute delight
to coach. He is very cooperative
and coachable. He is also very
motivated and very motivating to
be around. He is a senior set to go
out in style.” ‘ I

Cruz said he plans to continue
diving after this season. “I don’t
believe I will lose touch with it,”
he said.

Cruz’s eligibility will expire’ after
this year, but he plans, to keep
practicing with the team next
year until his graduation.

“My future goal this season is to
dive well at senior National
Prequalifications,” Cruz said.
“Hopefully everything will fall in
the right place at the right time,

- which is this weekend.”

Featured inthe Studio Theatre’s production of The Changeling are Marisa A. Pugliano, Bryn Bennett, Michele DiMaso, Taina Maki-Iso and Garrin W. Dickinson.

Lori M. Bossert
Staﬂ“ Writer

The Changeling: Re/Vision takes Pitt
theatergoers on a whirlwind journey
through Dennis Kennedy’s post-
modernized text of Thomas Middleton
and William Rowley’s 1622 play.

“[The play] is not a ‘modernized’
adaptation of the Jacobean play; a
modernized version implies an erasing of
the original to create a new work. Our
intention has been to maintain the original,
placing the contemporary on top of it as if
the new were a transparent overlay on the
old.

The method, I hope, allows the antique
to remain visible but in the way the past is
always seen, through the filter of the
present.

Thus this adaptation might be called a
‘postmodernized’ version,” said Dennis
Kennedy, the playwright who adapted the
script. -

The action takes place on several
platforms placed around Pitt’s Studio
Theater, located in the basement of the
Cathedral of Learning. Blending mime,
dance, music and .video with acting, an

. THE
Changeling
Pitt production presents postmodern
adaptation of 17th century portrayal

eclectic mix of styles and vehicles -
including rap and talk shows — are used
to present both the original text and the
ideas of the revision. The audience is
surrounded by the action: Characters move
in front of, behind, above and below
them.

It is hard not to become totally immersed
in the world the actors and designers have
created.

Both color and black-and-white video
monitors surround the playing area.
Sometimes the various thoughts and

fantasies of the principal characters are
shown on these. At other times the onstage
action is shown simultaneously on the
screen. The screens also show action
occurring offstage.

Erotic and challenging, this “re-vision”
of the original play explores and questions
the ideas of patriarchy, gender, love, lust
and Hell through a postmodern
perspective.

AX/e see the “revolutionary” ideas of
Middleton and Rowley highlighted in new
ways through the innovative staging and

design employed by director W. Stephen
Coleman and the production team.

As was the convention in 17th-century
theater, the play features both a plot and
a subplot. The plot takes place in high
society, while the subplot takes place in a
madhouse.

Both plot and subplot explore the effects
of lust on the lives of their central characters.
The plot concerns the tragic results of a
young noblewoman’s efforts to marry the
gentleman of her choice instead of her
mmas

Bryn Bennett shines as Beatrice, the
young noblewoman. At the play’s opening
she is betrothed to Alonzo De Piracquo
(Gary Landis). Blinded by her infatuation
with Alsemero (Greg Longenhagen),
another noble, she will try anything -
even murder — to free herself to marry
him.

She hires her father’s servant De Flores
(Glenn Alan Gardner) to"do the deed for
her, ignorant of its price. Bennet’s portrayal
of the ‘innocent young woman who
descends deeper and deeper into evildoing
is very strong.

The changes wrought in her by her

of Steven Severin and Budgie.
New to the band are Martin
McCarrick and Jon Klein and the
production talents of Stephen
Hague, who churned out such
new-wave classics as “West End
Girls" by the Pet Shop Boys and
“True Faith” by New Order. The
marriage has been a success. Their

College Charts and MTV’s “I20
Minutes,” also.

Let’s go to the press release:
“Lacedwitlishimmeringliastern
mysticism, earthy, tribal
incantation and the magical
technicolor wonderworld the
Banshees call their. own, one
sliver of this and you’ll be under
a spell.”

The single “Cities In Dust"
from the Tinderbox release
spawned depressing disco and
its off-kilter, art-goth rock,
which lurked throughout the
early ’80s. The Banshees
enjoyed low—key success

release: "A sharp mixture of
vaudeville and wonderland’? and
its domestic smash, “Peek—A—Boo,”
focused the group’s mainstream
appeal, which most likely Fina ncially
culminated with the Lollapalooza
tour of last summer. But now the
Banshees are sportin’ their own
American tour, so, “Go in with an
open mind, and have it expanded,
exalted and filled with more
glittering, sensual and dangerous
images."

Rap—-Lot label making moves

Rap-A—Lot. The label for the
’90s. I guarantee it. The production
ring on this label is deﬁnitely a
force to be reckoned with. It has
a habit of taking a familiar, dance-
type sample and giving it a rough,
laidback drive, devoid of high-
hats.

Along with the lyricists, whether
psychotic, mad, gangster, smooth
or just plain nasty, the label's
products seem to come out
massive.

Many know of Rap-A—Lot as the
Geto Boys’ label, but there is “A-

Medicine Man afflicted with unhealthy dose of Hollywood

By Brian Gallagher

Sta_ﬂ‘ Writer

On a talk show recently, Sean
Connery was asked to talk about
the On-location experiences from
his new film, Medicine Man.
Connery responded by referring
to the rain forest-like setting as
“that toilet in Mexico.” After seeing
this yawner of an ecological film
lesson, I only wish that in future
ventures,_ Connery disposes of
such less—than-palatable scripts
in that trash can in his office.’

V Either that, or pass it Off to an

actor worthy of such garbage —
like Buddy Ebsen.
MedictneMan is the story of an
eccentric research scientist, Dr.
Robert Campbell, and his quest
to rediscover the plant extract
that cures cancer, which is hidden

Construction.

Campbell, played by Connery,
has worked in the Amazon rain
forest for six years —— splitting his
time evenly between extracting
serum from rare plants (found in

-trees 100 feet high) and getting

drunk with the local tribe.

His research is funded by a
pharmaceutical corporation,
Aston, that hasn't received a
research update from the nutty
prof in three years. This is where
it's supposed to get fun.

‘get a babe in this story!" this

pharmaceutical company sends
down an independent, attractive
researcher named Dr. Rae Crane
(Lorraine Bracco) from the Bronx
to investigate the reclusive
Campbell.

The rest you can basically see
coming up Forbes Avenue: two
hours of smart~aleck banter
between a wily Scottish doctor

and a feisty New York researcher
— all while ﬁnding time to search
for the lost cancer serum.

This movie, directed by John
McTieman (Die Hard, The Hunt

for Red October), fails miserably
in attempting to be both
informative and semicompelling.
It has — at the same time — too
much star power and not enough
cohesive plot material going for it
to work.

McTieman, known for creating
explosive screen action, is
rendered useless in this ﬂick.
With his hands tied to a script that
requires only one climactic scene
(which turns out drab by his
standards), McTieman is left to
show Off nothing more than some
nifty spelunking equipment.

As for the actors, it isn't what
they do; it's how they perform

that makes the film awkward.
They detract from what seems to
be the real story in the film: the
redeeming value Of the rain forest.

Connery is at his stubborn,
goofy best as the reclusive doctor
whom Dr. Crane refers to as “Dr.
Mengela with a ponytail." (The
ponytail, by the way, won’t do
anything to hurt COnnery’s People-
magazine, studfest reputation. It's
doable.)

Upstaging the senior
Bondmeister is Bracco. Fresh from
her monster performance as mob
wife Karen Hill in Goodfellas,
Bracco displays the same
infectious, raw energy in her Dr.
Crane character. In fact, she
garners more laughs than the

supposed love are incredibly
realistic and believable.

Gardner’s De Flores is similarly
well played. He radiates a
brooding, obsessive passion for
Bennett every time he walks
onstage.

Both masterful and vulnerable,
he is one of the best in a cast full
of good actors.

Taking place in a madhouse,
the subplot mirrors the plight of
the nobles.

In a mirror, images are reversed.
Similarly, the subplot contains
many subtle differences. Alibius
(David Hadinger) is the proprietor
of the madhouse.

Hadinger turns in a nice
performance as the doddering
old fool with an undercurrent of
jealousy concerning his beautiful
young wife, Isabella (Carrie
Tracy).

Tracy gives a finely tuned
portrayal of the dominated young
wife who attempts to liberate
herself from the domineering

the madhouse, she attempts to
rendezvous with two gentlemen
who have entered the madhouse
hoping to win her affection. The
results are perhaps more tragic
due to treacherous Lollio, who
wishes to win her for himself.
Wielding a whip throughout the
play, White gives a convincing
portrait of the cruel madhouse
keeper.

Also worthy of special mention
are the actors and actresses who
play the madmen and mad-
women.

Resembling a Greek chorus,
they are onstage throughout much
of the play.

Alternately interacting with the

other characters and commenting
on the action, they provide a
unique atmosphere for this
production. They move the play
from scene to scene with ﬂuid
grace.

One of the many innovative
concepts is the “shadow”
character.

These characters present the
inner feelings of the principal
characters through both dialogue
and mime.

Played by Michele DiMaso and
Rachel F. Resinski, they move
with an expressive, lyrical grace.
They highlight the production
with voices most productions
must leave silent.

in which actors used improv-

during a post—show discussion.
“It was a developmental project,

Medicine
Continued from page 4
when she drinks this urine-like
medicine to cure a headache —
and, proceeds to get a major-
league buzz and turn silly.
Despite these positive vibes
from Connery and Bracco, the

. final result of the ﬂick just doesn’t

happen. It isn’t the acting orlthe
setting or the atmosphere: These
are tolerable, if not salvageable.
It is the clutter of a heartwarming
yet murky, lecturn-preaching
script that spells the demise Of
this flick.

"The story, written by Tom
-Schulman (DeadPoetsSociety), is

a promising idea. But as the film
gets rolling, it becomes obvious
that ol’ Tom wasn’t quite sure
where to take it. The plot spends
too much time scratching the
surface Of a variety of topics to
ever recover into a cohesive
narrative —— one that is both
educational and entertaining to
the viewer. In ascant 100 minutes,
the storyline remains on a single
topic for about as long as it takes
to say “Gordon Sumner” or “Peter
Gabriel.”

Case in point: Throughout the
film we get morsels of mediocre
screen material, including the

imminent destruction of the scenic
and resourceful rain forest, the
greedy workings ofcorporations,
the positive, peaceful ways Of the
natives and the evolving
relationship between Campbell
and Crane. Despite these
numerous story ideas, nothing
develops that is substantial
enough to warrant the expected
climax at the film’s end..

As for the expected “interaction”
between the two doctors, forget
about it. Hell, the preview
commercials hint that the
Connery—Bracco rendezvous is
front and center in the show’, yet
the two don’t even share an on-
screen smooch. Not that I was

type titillation, but when the film’s
two biggest assets in a film are
vibrant, independent character
actors like Connery and Bracco,
one expects more emphasis on
their relationship.

This is precisely where the
movie has its biggest problem:
the focus Of the story. On one
hand, you have the important
topic of the rain forest. On the
other hand, you have two actors
with dominant screen presence.
Something had to give.
Unfortunately, both topics were
spread too thin, leaving the
moviegoer with an inkling of
education and some wasted shots
of the rain forest.

two things should have been
done. Either de-emphasize the
ecological lecture and focus on
the two stars, or find two
unknown actors whose
performances will not
overshadow the film’s central
topic. It is particularly
disheartening to see capable
acting "and an authentic backdrop
wasted on a story that is more
indecisive than Mario Cuomo.
If you enjoy scenic, authentic-
looking movies that scratch the
surface of relevant social issues,
you will probably enjoy Medicine
Man. But for those movie junkies
with (perish the thought) a taste
for decent scripts, stay away from

 

looking for ajames Bond in Rio- T O do this story right, one of the bad doctor. '/R

vocals). Probably the most notable
in their repertoire is “Catholic
Guilt,” co-written by Debi and
Pitt academician Hazel Carr-
Leroy, where Debi’s banshee—like
screeching emancipates us from
Christian theology, throwing us
back to the reign of Tiberius and
Caligula: “I don’t care if your seed
was spilt  I don’t give a damn
about _your Catholic guilt!” My
fave was the initial “Song For
God,” with itsjohn Cale-like cello
strong in the mix. '

about as accessible as Hoffa’s
corpse, there is hope. Just an
hour ago I was chattin’ with Patty
about the fate of their full-length
that we all hoped Cubist would
scratch out, and it is recorded.
All they need now is a new
distributor.

For those unfamiliar, the band
derived its name from the cut on
the first Birthday Party Peel
Session. Their ﬁrst public outing
was opening for the down-the-
river minstrel, Alex Chilton.
Speaking of playing out, they
had a keen sense of thecommon

good: When a pillar of
righteousness was in need of
scratch, from the Vivian Campbell
Fund to a Sonic Temple rent
party, the P-Heads walked the
walk.

Their lineup was always a 50/
50 female integration: Debi and
Patty on guitar and vocals and
Smith Hutchings on bass were
the mainstays, while like Reiner’s
pseudo-fictitious Spinal Tap, the
drummer spot was a revolving
doon

It started with Jimmy Neiser,
who lasted six months or so.
