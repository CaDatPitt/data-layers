Pitt names
additional
president

finalists

By Scot Ross
Editor in Chief

Two more finalists have been
announced in Pitt's search for a
successor to retiring Pitt President
Wesley Posvar.

Gershon Vincow, a 56-year-
old vice chancellor for academic
affairs at Syracuse University, and
Robert Hess, the 59-year-old
president of Brooklyn College,
will meet with students,
administrators, faculty and staff
this week.

Vincow, who will visit PittApril
2 and 3, has held a number of
administrative positions at
Syracuse University since 1971:
professor and department
chairperson, vice president for
research and graduate affairs and
dean of the college of arts and
sciences.

From 1961 until 1971, Vincow
was a member of the chemistry
department at the University of
Washington in Seattle.

Vincow was a Pulitzer
Scholarship winner at Columbia
University in New York City,
where he graduated first in his
class and completed his master’s
and doctoral studies. Vincow
completed his post—doctoral work
at the Hebrew Institute in
Jerusalem and at the California
Institute of Technology.

Vincow was unavailable for
comment; however, Syracuse’s
dean of the college of ans and
sciences, Samuel Gorovitz,
expressed confidence in Vincow’s
administrative abilities.

Syracuse’s status as a research
university is similar to Pitt’s.
However, Gorovitz said that
Vincow has maintained a
commitment to undergraduate
education.

“Our concern is that the
research activity of the university
is itself supportive of
undergraduate education. We
have made some very good
progress in recent years through
a number of measures,” Gorovitz
said.

One of the programs Vincow
has started gives senior faculty
the responsibility of teaching
some introductory-level
undergraduate courses.

“He is working very hard and

‘effectively this year on making
further improvements, despite the
fact that there are budgetary
constraints,” said Gorovitz.

Gorovitz said Vincow has made
“very good appointments” of

Disc jockey, citizens mobilize to save mosque

By Mike Ertl
St‘a_[)" Writer

A local disc jockey and a group
of Oakland citizens have teamed
up to organize a petition drive in
an attempt to save the Syria
Mosque from the wrecking ball.

According to WMXP disc jockey
Jay Silvers, he will be among the
concerned citizens in front of the
old theater at 11 a.m. today in an
attempt to garner public support
to keep the mosque from being
destroyed.

“You know, if you believe in
something and if people really
want it to stay, I think if we all
work together, we can keep it,”
said Silvers.

The Oakland landmark was

purchased early last week from
the Syria Temple for $10 million
by National Development Corp.,
which has obtained a demolition
permit for the property.

. According to Silvers, he became
involved with the petition project
after he aired his opinion against
demolishing the 76-year-old
structure during his show
Tuesday.

Silvers received an over-
whelming response from his
listeners after inviting them to
call in with their views on the
subject. '

“I expressed myself on the air,
howl felt about it, and I had a lot
of listeners call up, and they felt
the same way,” said Silvers,
estimating that over 300 people

' phoned in during his show.

One of the callers, Oakland
resident Janice Markowitz,
conceived the idea for the petition
drive.

Markowitz, who is a member
of the Oakland citizens-advocacy
group Four Citizens Safety
Coalition, said she was deeply
concerned about the plans to
demolish the building, stressing
its importance as a cultural center
and as part of the historical and
ethnic fabric of the Oakland
community.

“I’ve been getting a lot of calls
from a lot of people, calls from all
over the place," said Markowitz,
“There are many people
throughout the entire city that
have sentimental attachment to

"it"

According to Markowitz, she
isn't sure how many people will
turn out for the drive, but she said
around 50 people have already
contacted her.

“We're just going to get as
many people as we can. We’re
going to try to get some people
downtown and in Oakland,” she
said. “Maybe with an outcry and
an outpouring from the people,
we can maintain and keep this
building.”

“I hope that more people get
involved; it’s something where
you don’t want to say, ‘Well, let
someone else do it,’” said Silvers.
“If the people truly believe that it
should be saved  it’s a shame to
tear it down.”

Activists focus on increasing gay visibiltiy

By Mike Ertl
Staﬁ" Writer

Gay—rights activism, with a focus on
increased visibility of the gay community,
was the topic of discussion at Thursday's
Bisexual, Gay and Lesbian Alliance meeting
at the William Pitt Union.

According to Laura Johnston, a gay-rights
activist, the city of Pittsburgh is largely unaware
that a gay community exists. “The real trip to
this is they think there's only about seven of
us,” she said. “They don’t think we exist.”

Her views were shared by fellow activist
Jim Crow. “I believe we all have to go out
there and light for lvisibilityl," said Crow.

Crow, Johnston and fellow activists Carol
Moeller and Glenn Hyde have formed Queer
Nation, a new organization which, according
to Crow, will be anti-racist, pro-feminist and

focus on promoting gay visibility.

“The object of Queer Nation is to make us
a visible force,” saidJohnston. “We’re deﬁnitely
out to provide visibility,” she said, adding that
the group will encourage gays to “come out”
and to “show people that they can’t push us
around any more, that we won't stand for that
any more.”

Queer Nation will hold its first meeting
April 4 at 8 p.m. on the second floor of the
William‘ Pitt Union.

“The meetings are going to be sort of like
anarchy," said Crow, noting that everyone
will have a say in what goes on. “We don’t
want the minority voice to be squeezed out by
dominating personalities.”

One of the first items on the group's agenda
is the initiation of a sticker campaign in the
city to promote awareness.

“We're definitely going to fight and destroy

heterosexism," said Crow.

Also speaking at the meeting was activist
Bill Hileman. “We're willing to go to almost
any length to get our point across,” said Hile-
man, recalling how he and other activists had
to go to great lengths to try to get action on
legal and social rights for the gay community.

He described how he once jumped up on
stage when Mayor Sophie Masloff was
preparing for a debate in Squirrel Hill. He
said, “Hi Sophie, I'm Bill Hileman. We talked
a few times on the phone, and good luck in
the debate tonight I hope you talk about gay
rights this evening.”

“We described exactly what our agenda
was, and we described exactly how we were
going to handle our policies,” said Hileman.
The only way they could get any action was
by taking an “in-your-face type of attitude,”
he said.

Support for gulf veterans still important

By Debbie Lincoln
Sta‘[)“W1-lter

- The importance of continued
support for veterans of the gulf
war and their families was stressed
at a discussion held by the School
of Social Work Thursday evening
in the Frick Fine Arts Auditorium.
The program, put together by
social—work students, was part of
a month-long series of events.

Guest speaker Dr. Michelle
Harrison, an associate professor
of psychiatry at the the University
of Pittsburgh medical school and
a member of the Center for
Medical Ethics, said it is important
for people to continue tosupport
veterans of the gulf war and their
families.

“Interest [in the war] has
dwindled; for people who weren’t
directly involved, the interest has
disappeared. For people who still
have someone over there, it’s still
a major issue,” said Harrison,
who added that these people are
still worrying while others are
celebrating.

 E99‘: ‘v‘«’ar:‘-er-i-a-febert Co.

Harrison said the media
coverage brought the war closer
to the American public while
simultaneously making the war
seem unrealistic. “Watching war
on television became a way of
tuning into a community
experience," she said.

The effects of the gulf war will
especially be felt in western
Pennsylvania because of the high
number of wounded from the
area, including members of the
unit from Greensburg hit by a
Scud missile attack in Saudi
Arabia, said Harrison.

‘‘I don’t think there’s anywhere
in the country that had such a
high concentration of casualties,”
she said.

According to Harrison, many
groups felt the effects of
discrimination and alienation,
including Arabs, Arab-Americans,
Jews, blacks and people involved
in the anti—war movement. -She
said that the debate within
Congress was further evidence of
the divisions among the
population that “characterized the

division within
themselves. ”

Duane Brokenbek, a counselor
at the Vietnam Vets Resource
Center, said the symptoms of
soldiers involved in the gulf war
will probably be short term
compared to the long-term,
chronic symptoms of many
Vietnam War veterans. “The good
thing is that their problems will
be nothing like they were in
Vietnam,” he said.

“The bulk of the people [in the
gulf war] were non—combatants;
there weren’t as many grunts,” he
said. According to Brokenbek, a
Vietnam War veteran, the length
of combat experience is directly
related to the severity of battle
symptoms.

“A symptom being reflected in
these people is survival guilt:
‘Why didn’t this happen to me?”’
said Brokenbek. “You never
forget the people you serve with.”

Counselors have learned
lessons from the Vietnam War
and are now better prepared to
deal with soldiers suffering from

people

On Earth.

combat symptoms, according to
Brokenbek.

“The ‘welcome home’ is a major
part of the readjustment process,”
he said.

Brokenbek compared the
return of the gulf war soldiers
with his own homecoming, which
consisted of insults and
accusations that made him
exchange his uniform for civilian
clothes. Z

Brokenbek admitted that there
is still hostility about the difficult
integration of Vietnam veterans
into society, but he said, “I’d just
as soon shake [the gulf war
veterans’) hands and get on with
it.” ,

When the soldiers return from
the gulf, there will be difficulties
with reassigning roles within their
families, said Harrison.

“When someone’s away [a long
time], there’s a shift in roles, and
it’s often hard to go back to the
way it was before,” said Harrison.
“We don’t know what the ending
is yet; we only know about the
battlefield.”

Upward Bound helps students succeed

By Megan Bertino
Staﬁ“ Writer

Local professionals were on
hand Thursday to show select
high school students how far
hard work, persistence and the
desire to succeed can take them,
according to Upward Bound
program director Renee Frazier.

Frazier spoke at UB’s second
annual career fair, where Citicorp
program director Ruth Parsons
was among many professionals
who discussed how UB helped
them succeed.

“Upward Bound is one of the
most impactful social programs
in the history of the U.S. I believe
it has sent more minorities on to
higher education than any other
program,” Parsons said.

Upward Bound is a federally
funded program conducted
nationally through colleges and
universities.

The program helps students
succeed in high school through
encouragement, tutoring and
preparation for college, said
Charlotte McDonald, an Upward
Bound counselor at Pitt.

Students who apply to the

program are interviewed to
determine if they will benefit
from Upward Bound, said
McDonald. Students must be the
first in their families to attend
college. Although most students
in Upward Bound are from low-
income families, this is not
required, said McDonald.

Mathilda Spencer, a juvenile
probation officer, said, “I was in
Upward Bound at [Carnegie
Mellon], and I think that is why I
went to college . It’s an excellent
program.”

Frankie Mayson, a radio
announcer for WAMO, said,
“Upward Bound helped me move
into the direction of college. It’s
a great opportunity for young
kids.”

Linda Baily, an English teacher
at Peabody High School, said she
is supportive of the program
because students choose to be a
part of it.

“The environment is so
different from the classroom. In
the classroom the students are
there because it’s the law; [tonight]
the students are here because
they want to be,” Baily said.

The students were expected to

speak with every professional
and ask them questions from a
prepared questionnaire.

Students discussed their
interests and fears about college
and the business world.

Dayuan Garner, a high-school
sophomore, said is in the Upward
Bound program.

“The career fair and Upward
Bound are helping me out  I
want to go to college and become
a lawyer,” Garner said.

Cynthia Baldwin, an Allegheny
County Court of Common Pleas
judge, said that Upward Bound
“helps young people, especially
minority or disadvantaged
students  It gives them goals
and ways of achieving goals.”

The program holds activities
and tutoring sessions for students.
During the summer, the students
spend six weeks at the college
where the Upward Bound chapter
is based.

Those who will be attending
college in the fall take English,
math and science courses that
will transfer to the college they
will be attending. Those still in
high school take preparatory
classes.

The stress associated with
grades, relationships or family
problems can leave a college
student upset and in need of
someone to talk to.

Pitt offers emergency assistance
24 hours a day through the
Counseling and Student
DevelopmentCenterand\X/estern
Psychiatric Institute & Clinic’s
Diagnostic and Evaluation Center.

Dr. Robert Gallagher, director
of the counseling center, said
that there is a psychologist on call
at all times to deal with emergency

situations.

“If someone is extremely upset
and agitated, it’s up to the on-call
psychologist to see [that the
person] gets immediate attention,”
said Gallagher.

The on-call counselor can be
reached at the counseling center
during office hours or at home
through either the campus police
or a resident assistant.

The counselor listens for basic
danger signals, said Gallagher.
These include a caller thinking of
hurting him- or herself, feeling
that he or she is out of control
and thinking of committing

suicide.

“With a number of calls, once
[the callers] have a chance to talk
about [their problems], they find
that they can hang on until the
next day,” said Gallagher.

The counselor tries to convince
the caller to come to the
counseling center during normal

office hours and makes
arrangements for a psychologist
to see that person.

In major emergencies, when
the counselor judges that the
caller may be dangerously
suicidal or in need of a
tranquilizer, arrangements are
made for the caller to go to
Western Psychiatric Institute 8;
Clinic’s emergency room.
Counselors have also gone into
residence halls to talk directly
with their callers.

‘‘I’d want to see them as soon
as they could be seen,” said Dr.

counselor.

“If the person is calling me
directly, I generally have them
come in [to the counseling center]
as soon as possible,” she said.

Crary said that the same holds
true if the call is from a friend of
someone who is seriously upset
or depressed.

“I talk about ways [the caller]
can get the friend into the office.
One thing a friend can say is that
most problems can be solved,”
she said.

Accompanying the person in

also helps. Crary also encourages

Former
Vanderbilt

professor
will head

HEW C€I1lI€I'

ByKathy Kmiecik
Sta_[)" Writer A

A former professor of

medicine and pharmacol-
ogy at Vanderbilt University
has been appointed the
director of the Pitt Medical
Center's new Center for
Clinical Pharmacology.
C‘ Dr. Anthony Branch was
recently named director of
the center, ,which began
operating on Jan. 1. The
center is still being
organized and has not
begun any projects,
according to Ray Cobb,
media coordinator for the
University Health Sciences
News Bureau.

The center’s main focus
will be drug metabolism,
blood—pressure regulation
and renal pathophysiology,
he said.

Branch said, “Our work
will aid us in the
development of new drugs,
provide greater insight into
how drugs work and why
people respond differently
to similar doses of the same
drug.”

The Center for Clinical
Pharmacology is the first to
combine the disciplines of
the medical and pharmacy
schools, Cobb said..

Scientists and clinicians
will work together to use
research to advance clinical
medicine, according to
Cobb.

“Its focus is to bring
together various disciplines
and to put the research
with the people who

, actually work with the

patients,” Cobb said.

Branch, along with
directing the new center, is
also an associate dean of
research in the School of
Pharmacy.

Dr. Randy Juhl, dean of
the school, said Branch’s
work will be a positive
inﬂuence for the UPMC as
a whole, especially the
School of Pharmacy.

Branch received his
medical degree from the
University of Bristol Medial
School in Bristol, England.

Branch is also a member
of several prestigious
medical and scientific
associations, including the
American Society for
Clinical Investigation and
the British Society of Clinical
Pharmacology.

Although no projects are
currently under way,
Branch plans to announce
the center’s future plans
soon. ’

QPA

Continued from page 3

Although the program formerly
existed under the placement
office, it has been operated by
students for the past year, with
the placement office as governing
body. A council of 10 students
operates the program. Candidates
for the council must turn in their
resume and fill out an application.
The candidate’s application is
reviewed and voted upon by
council members. All minority
students, whether they are
seeking a seat on council or not,
are encouraged to participate in
the program.

“The biggest misconception is
that students think you have to
have exceptional grades to
participate in the program,” said
his Fontaine, assistant coordinator
of QPA.

Fontaine said this is the main
reason for lack of support from
minority students.

Council members are striving
to reach out to minorities on all
academic levels, she said. Students
are required to fill out a
registration form at the placement
office and submit two copies of
their resume. One copy will be
filed with the QPA program and

the other in the placement office.
Students will be informed of
upcoming seminars and
information regarding job
searches.

Lack of participation is not the
only factor affecting the program,
according to Fontaine. There are
problems within the QPA
program that hinder its
effectiveness.

“We need to get ourselves
together and become more
professional. If we don’t look
good, how can we say we can
help students find a job?” Fontaine
said. She said there are not
enough dedicated members to
help plan and attend seminars.

Fontaine will take over as
chairperson in April. Along with
striving to become more
professional, she said she wants
more publicity on campus and
would like the organization to
separate from the placement
Of/llC€.

“We are anticipating the fact
that more publicity will create
increased minority involvement,
and separation from the
placement office will allow us to
do the things we want to do,” she
said.

IFC elects Greek
Week chairperson

By Karen D. Speece
Senior Stay‘ Writer

Inter—Fraternity Council representatives elected the 1992
overall Greek Week chairperson at a meeting last week.

Reid Sadler, a brother of Phi Gamma Delta, was elected to
serve as next year's overall Greek Week chairperson.

“My general ideas are to eliminate the cutthroat competition.
Greek Week itself is competitive enough,” Sadler said. He
intends to distribute cans earlier and have the money collected
before the beginning of Greek Week so that some of the
competition of canning the most money eliminated and the
week is more enjoyable.

the center for the sessions.

Resident assistants are
trained in crisis intervention
and are on the lookout for
changes inthe behavior of
their residents, said
Assis‘tant Director of
Residence Life Jon
Conlogue.

These include radical
changes in sleeping and
waking schedules, changes
in dress and appearance,
violent behavior, talking
about suicide, excessive
drinking and talking about
withdrawing from classes.

“Alcohol is more often
than not involved in
lstudents’ problemsl," said
Conlogue.

“Students see drinking
as escape. People drink to
forget, and instead [the
alcohol] depresses them,
and the problems become
worse,” Conlogue said.

Resident assistants do
about five, to 10 crisis
interventions a term and
encourage depressed
residents to talk to
counselors at the
counseling center, clergy
from Campus Ministries,
friends or their resident
assistants, said Conlogue.

“The important thing is
that they get help," he said.

“I think a lot of people
are embarrassed to seek
help,” said Jack Cahalane
of Western Psychiatric
Institute & Clinic. “Stigma
[of going to a psychiatric
help center] is a problem.”

The Diagnostic
Evaluation Center, which
is WPIC’s emergency room,
is open 24 hours a day for
those in serious need of
help.

. “[At the DEC] they try to
get a sense of how urgent
[the problem] is,” said
Cahalane, who, as clinical

administrator of the

Bellefield Assessment
Center for Anxiety and
Depression, helps with'the
referrals of Pitt students.

Cahalane said that the
college-age group seems
to be especially vulnerable
to depression, suicidal
tendencies and other
emotional problems.

“It’s the age in transition
when people can develop
psychiatric disorders," he
said.

“For many college
students, college is the first
time that they are away
from family and a
supportive environment
that helps them deal with
their problems.”

Friends of troubled
students can offer support
by making sure that the
troubled student seeks
help.

“It’s best, if you're not a
mental-health professional,
to get a mental-health
professional involved,”

minorities, but Vincow is not
willing to hire someone solely
because of his or her ethnic
background.

‘Many departments have
proposed making appointments
of African—American faculty,
which  he has rejected on the
grounds of an unwillingness to
appoint simply because they are
African—American, [but] faculty
who would not be appointable
otherwise. This, I suppose, has
perhaps not been approved by
all," Gorovitz said. “We have not
had anything that I would describe
as controversy, as distinct from
concern.”

Vincow resides in Fayetteville,
N.Y., with his wife Dina. He has
two daughters, Evelyn and
Michelle.

Hess has been the president, as
well as a professor of history, at
Brooklyn College since 1979. Hess
said he would rather not comment
until he arrived at Pitt on April 4
and 5. Members of his
administration were unavailable
for comment because of spring
recess.

During his professional career,
Hess has been an administrator
and faculty member at the
University of Illinois at Chicago,
where he worked from 1966 until
1976, departing as the associate
vice chancellor for academic

affairs (budget and planning).

Hess’ earlier appointments
include: assistant professor of
African history at Northwestern
University from 1964-65; assistant
professor of history at Mount
Holyoke College from 1961-64
and instructor and assistant
professor of history and economics
at Carnegie Tech (now Carnegie
Mellon) from 1958 to 1961.

In addition, Hess was awarded
a visiting assistant professorship
of African history at Amherst
College and Boston University in
1962 and 1963.

Hess received his bachelor’s
degree from Yale University in
1958, and he graduated magna
cum laude.

He completed his master’s and
doctoral work at Yale University,
in addition to his education as a
Fulbright scholar at the University
of Rome.

He is ﬂuent in Italian and is
proficient in several other
languages, including French and
Spanish. Hess has done research
in Italy, Somalia and Ethiopia.

Hess presently lives in Brooklyn
and is married to Frances H. Aaron.
They have four children.

police reports.

Pitt President Wesley Posvar said it was an “error” not to use
summary police reports in the past.

He said the summary reports provide incident descriptions
but do not include specific details such as names of the people
involved in the incidents and “hearsay reportings.”

“If the police reports included this type of information, it
would be an infringement on the rights of people,” Posvar said.
“The summary reports are legitimate and constitutional. Providing
full reports was an error.”

William Brennan, director of public safety, said Pitt decided
to release summary police reports to avoid possible liability
caused by releasing the original police reports.

Brennan said the campus police spends a great amount of
time summarizing the police reports.

“There has been no attempt to shut out the constituency by
using the summary police reports,” Brennan added.

Posvar said the police reports concern human rights, not the
freedom of the press.

“ The Pittsburgh Press and the public media who exploit this
are being irresponsible and unethical journalists. It’s bad
journalism," Posvar said.

Posvar added that if the city police provide more sophisticated
police reports than the campus police, the campus police
should consider following the city police’s record procedure.

The Pitt News Editor in Chief Scot Ross presented 1,900
petitions to Posvar and Brennan from students who are
dissatisfied with the campus police report policy.

Cahalane said.

 

During the past seven months, I ’ve wanted to
devote my time and energy to‘issues that I

seldom have the opportunity to examine;

However, the social engineers have seen ﬁt to
dash my hopes once again. To what am I
referring? I’m talking about the yearly attempt to
undermine the Second Amendment rights of

_ millions in the name of “common sense” gun-

control measures (in this case, the soon-to-be-
voted—upon Brady Bill and “assault weapons”

‘ ban).

For years I’ve wondered how a small minority

of uptight hoplaphobes (those afflicted with a«

pathological terror of ﬁrearms) can dictate its
ideas of right and wrong in blatant violation of
our Second Amendment rights. With that in
mind, please grant me a few minutes of your
time so thatl may enlighten you as to the reality
of so-called “common sense” gun control.

The Brady Bill, requiring a seven-day waiting
period and a background check before all
firearms purchases, is not as harmless as it
seems. Many provisions of the bill should be
frightening to even an American Civil Liberties
Union lackey. This bill requires that the police
take time away from normal duties in order to
do such things as conduct searches of gun
buyers’ homes.

What happens when the officer conducting
the search becomes offended by someone’s
choice ofmusic, literature or political affiliation?

Tom Lester

Scary, isn’t it? .

This bill is not only badly written, it is also
completely unnecessary and unfair. Why is it
necessary to deny someone their rights for at
leastseven days, when a computer background
check can be accomplished in minutes? These
instantaneous background checks have worked
wonderfully in Virginia, much to the chagrin of
Sarah Brady and Handgun Control, Inc., which
has been fighting the implementation of similar
systems across the country simply because
they’ve been NRA—supported.

Furthermore, who is Sarah Brady to tell an
abused or threatened woman to wait a week or
more while needless checks, meant only to
discourage firearms purchases, are performed,
particularly when society’s villains can acquire
weapons within minutes on the street, where
the Brady Bill is a joke?

As for the banning of “assault weapons,” I can
make my point with a simple story. Two weeks
ago, I was teaching a girl how to shoot an AK-
47, and she asked me the name of the weapon

she had just fired. I replied that the weapon was 5

the infamous AK-47 that the anti—gun lobby
wanted to ban.

She immediately gave me a puzzledlook and
asked, “Why? Is it because of the way it looks
(military and, presumably, ominous)?”

If a bright, open-minded person with limited
experience around firearms can see no danger
in having a semi—automatic rifle, why can't the
social engineers be equally open-minded and
leave those of us alone who enjoy the shooting
sports?

There is nothing inherently dangerous about
semi-automatic weapons. They are not machine
guns, as some would have you believe, and
they are built with technology that hasibeen
common since the 18905! Their only fault is that
they look dangerous to people who know
nothing about firearms. ’

Every year, thousands‘ of semi—automatic
firearms are used in local and national shooting
competitions, as is the case with the $1,000—plus
Springfield MIA, which would be banned if the
law passes through Congress, even though less
than 1 percent of all semi-automatic “assault”-

‘ style firearms are used to commit crimes.

Don’t sacrifice the Bill of Rights for bills that
are wrong. I implore you to keep this com-
mentary in mind and to tell the politicos to’ vote
against H.R. 7, S. 257 (the Brady Bill) and the
assault—weapons ban when it comes up for
another vote.

 Minimum wage restrictions hurt employers

Today, the new federal hourly
minimum wage of $4.25 goes into
effect. This means that employers
are required to pay their employ-
ees at least $4.25 pm hour.

In other words, it is illegal for

. employers to pay their employees

less than $4.25 per hour. This is a
clear violation of individual free-
dom. If two consenting human

, beings choose, on their own_ free

will, to enter into any type of
relationship, then that relationship
should be permitted. If two people
voluntarily enter into an employer/
employee relationship that includes
agreed-upon wages of, say, $3 per
hour, then that relationship should
be permitted.

Daniel
Alman

One person I know was working
at a job that paid less than minimum
wage. But a government official
found out and ordered his employer
to fire him. I

Another person I know had a job
that was paying minimum wage.
But then the government raised
the minimum wage. His employer
could not afford to pay him the
new minimum wage, so he was
fired. .

In each of these cases, there was

\

a person who was willing to work
for a certain wage, but the gov-
ernment would not allow it.
‘Many people, particularly teen-
agers, who are new in the job
market are unskilled. Perhaps their
labor is worth only $3 per hour.
No employer would ever hire
such a person at $4.25 per hour
because the employer would lose

. money.

Politicians are often complaining
about the high rate of teenage
unemployment. As a “solution” to
this problem, many politicians have
advocated various government job
programs. ,

Instead of spending more tax
dollars (and I should mention that

 

DA‘/LIGHT 54”/Q6 1-IMF: CLAIMS

AN01-Hag youm MI NP

 

  

taxation destroys jobs in the pri- ’
vate sector anyway), wouldn’t it be '

better to simply legalize the work
that these teenagers are capable of
doing? In other words, abolish the
minimum—wage law.

For those who are new to the job
market, money is not the only
benefit of having a job. A job also
helps newcomers to gain valuable
work experience. As people get‘
more and more work experience,
the value of their labor will tend to

_increase, and it will become easier

for them to move on to higher-
paying jobs. The minimum-wage

law often makes it difficult for"

people who are_ new to the job-
market to get any experience.

‘ 5 Supporters of the minirnum—wage

law often argue, “You can’t live on
$3 an hour.” ,
Actually, you might be able to

live on $3 an hour if certain changes ,

were made. For example, if farm
subsidies were eliminated, food

People who advocate raising the

SGB, apathy feasosfr RSC’ demie 

So the Representative Student
Council, a dying organization only
five months old and only recently
supposed to have been approved
to stand on its own, has been killed
by the [Student Government Board].
A “cost-beneﬁt analysis and..as—
sessment of the council’s effec-
tiveness" proved that the RSC is not
“worth [SGB] time,” claims [SGB
member] Gil Golden. How can
anyone assess the RSC when it is
just trying to get off the ground and

hasn’t had a chance to do anything? ‘

And where does the SGB ﬁnd the
power to terminate an organization
set up, as I quote its constitutional
goals, “to offer a consolidated stance
of issues so that the SGB and
administration can better and more
accurately represent student orga-
nizations”? The SGB did not start
the process to bring this group

_ together. It should not end it on its

own.

Golden continued that the ‘-‘RSC
brought about its own demise."
Themeetings that I have attended
do not bear that theory -out. No
organization with goals as large as
the RSC’s can become fully opera-
tional overnight. The SGB has had
such a hand in this group that it
cannot be said that the RSC alone
destroyed itself. What killed the
‘RSC? I have some more specific
explanations. Apathy, the ruling
attitude of the world today, obvi-
ously claimed many of the ‘RSC
members. But I think apathy alone
did not account for many of the
absent. When the board members
of this group were elected, there
was a large number of people
present. Many of these people never
returned. Probably half the board
members were missing at every
meeting since they were elected: I
wonder if these resume padders
are worried now about someone
checking to see if the Representa-
tive Student Council really existed?

Bad enough that the motives of

some of the board members were -

questionable, but what about those
of the electedzchairperson? All the
initial organizi\ng of the RSC was
done admirably by Chris Wilhelm,
but merely minutes before the
election, [former SGB member]
Mike Golden decided that he had
put enough time into the formation
of the group that he wanted to
continue with it. A couple months
later we were informed that Mike
Golden was stepping down be-
cause he would be graduating this
year and felt it would be better if
someone else ran the group. Gil.
Golden, the SGB representative
who supposedly had been attend-
ing the meetings, took over as
interim chairperson, and nothing
substantial was done.

What really bothers me about
the SGB connection is when the
termination of the RSC is “a strong
indication of thecurrent [SGB’sl
success.” With the apathy that runs

rampant onthis campus, I'm sure"
enough‘ people will believe this '
statement. But’ the SGB had made.

numerous promises to support this
group, and its ending appears to

me to have been ’made solely by 9
’ theSGB. Despite payingforseveral {

  Letters

large advertisements for RSC meet-
ings, the amount of support given
by the SGB was non-existent.
Anotherproblem with the attitude
conveyed in the article, and_ also a
potential problem with the RSC if it
continued to exist, was the rela-
tionship between the SGB and RSC.
[Gill Golden claims that if the RSC
were needed, it would be supported
by the SGB. It seemed to me as
though the SGB members wanted
the SGB to have more interaction
and checks by the students on
campus when they were cam-
paigning for their jobs. This was to
be the role of the RSC. ISGB
President] Brent Saunders attended
several meetings and gave me the
impression that if the RSC could

' help the SGB, then the SGB con-

sidered the RSC important But on
issues where the SGB was chal-
lenged or threatened, then the basis
of the RSC’s representation was
questioned. With that in mind as I
read the article proclaiming the
RSC’s demise, I truly wonder if the
members of the SGB saw the RSC
as potentially a hindrance to their

. power, and since they just gained

their power, they decided to renege

on their earlier promises to support

a greater role of the students in

student government. What was the
Orwell quote?

Joseph Babinsack

Keep the living alive

, I was disturbed by the article Eric
Hoch wrote about dying with dig-
nity. Mr. Hoch discussed in his
article that he worked two summers
in a nursing home, and he felt that
some people were better off dead
than alive. He goes on to compare
a human life to a household pet

’ Mr. Hoch, there is a difference.

“If Mr. Hoch did hear Mr. Andreola

speak (which I can bet he didn't), 9

he would have been horriﬁed by

how cruel an act of starvation re-.

ally can be. A person can live up to
12 days without food while their
tongue cracks and their skin hangs
on their body, suffering while
someone is giving them a “humane
option” of dying. Seeing someone
gasping for water and suffering for
12 days sounds like a real humane
option to me. Mr. Hoch, you can-
not cure the disease by killing the
patient. ' '
If we‘ become a society that
chooses who is worthy of living
and who is worthy of dying, then
we are no better than Hitler and the
SS. Anyone who studied Hitler
knows that he found homosexuals,

cripples, gypsies and mentally ill’

people unworthy of life. By pro-
viding doctors with the ability to’
choose who lives and who dies,
we areno better than Nazi Ger-
many. ' - ’
,_,'One girl at the meeting spoke
about her fathervbeing a doctor.
She said that he had a patient who
was in a" coma’-for two years and

» wokeup one day and was fine and
remembered? everything. What

i
.- vii,

. surrounding Israel‘ have been kept

.\‘

the decision to end his life was

i made a year earlier? Many people

that sign living wills do get sick and
realize that they had made a rnis—
take and do indeed want treatment
By making people sign a legal
document saying that they want to

die, it gives a person no possible-

way to change their mind. i

The problem with our society
today is that we do not have any
respect for human life. We've gotten
to the point where one’s life is
measured by material possessions
and not by one’s right to live. (No
matter what type of life, all human
life deserves the chance to live no
matter what the circumstances) We,
as a society, treat people as com-
moditiesrather than human beings.
Even though the lady Mr. Hoch
discusses was suffering, would it
make her feel any better if she died
by slow dehydration for two weeks?
And if we start by giving her a
lethal injection to die, what happens
when the next accident victim
comes into the emergency room
and ‘a doctor decides that he is
unworthy. of living?

At my sister's medical-school
graduation she took an oath to
save people's lives. In that oath, I
didn't hear anything about starving
people. All human life is precious,
why don't we treat it thatway?

Israel helped refugees
' In response" to the letter to the
editor by Candice Gruver (March
13, 1991), I hope that Ms. -Gruver
will take a notefrom her own letter
and start using historical_fact father
than revisionist propaganda in

discussing Israel and the/Palestin-_

ians. The Israelis did not~“take over
Palestine and [force] the Palestin-
ian people to relocate to other
countries or to refugee camps.”
Israel was established by a vote of

‘ the United Nations in November

1947. At the same time, an ‘Arab
country _was created. The Arab
nations surrounding Israel’ imme-
diately attacked it in an attempt to
destroy it. In the process, they
urged the Arabs living there to
leave so that the attacking nations
would be free to-destroy the state
of Israel and then give the entire
land to the Arab population. Un-
fortunately for the five or six Arab
nations who attacked thestate of.
Israel, and unfortunately for the

Arabs who could have had their .

own state if their “brothers” had

permitted it to be established, Is'- .

‘ rael defended its borders and drove
back» the invaders. Ever since, the
refugees created by the Arab nations‘

 

_ eyes of the world.

‘ that nations generally, in their

 

-.__i.

 

 

. as pawns in the political struggle.
Ms. Gruver should also remem-,:_ I I
ber that Jews have lived continu-
ously in “Palestine” for more than 
3,000 years, and that they had lived ~ 
there as an independent nation -for
almost 1,000 years. For the past *
almost 2,000 years, the Jews have
prayed three times a day for the ,-
,restoration of their country and i
their capital Jerusalem, so Israel is‘ .
not a Johnny-come-lately on the ’
historical scene. '
As for the case for refugees, Ms.
Gruver apparently does not know V
that Israel, from 1948 to the early_
1950s, took in the approximately -
850,000 Jews who were expelled
from Arab countries, leaving ev- 8
erything they owned behind them." ‘
Of the 600,000 or so refugees cre-
ated by the Arab invasion of Israel.
in 1948, a small number was taken-
in for resettlement by Jordan or by,
Lebanon, but most were c_onfinedt3‘
to refugee camps. Their Arab
brothers did not attempt to take;
them into their own homelands for;
resettlement and the creation of A
new productive lives. When Israel,
in the early 1970s, tried to build
new homes for the refugees so as:
to take them__out of the" squalid,
refugee camps, the Arab-nations"
successfully fought against’ this
humanitarian attempt and have kep ..
the majority of the refugees in their '9
pitiable condition so as to maintain‘,
the horror of their lives before, —.

  
  
   
  
   
   
   
   
   
  
   
   
   
  
  
  
  
  
  
   
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
   
  
    
    
   
  
  
  
  
   
  
   
    
    
    
  
   
    
    
    
  
   
    
    
  
  
   
   
   
   
   
 
 

There was no outcry in the United

(in the “West Bank”). In Gaza‘, fo__

Bad game 

UNLV's off night still spells excellence

I arrived at a local
bar-restaurant

Saturday night
midway through the
first half of the Duke-
UNLV national-
championship
semiﬁnal game, and
before I sat down, I

 

asked a group. of three

“But they lost!! They
were supposed to take

saying in disbelief.
True. Vegas

game. The team

young women which

team was winning.

“Duke!” said one of the co-eds
enthusiastically.

“Duke?” I replied with a
perplexed look on my face.

“Yes, Duke. Why do you look
so surprised?” the woman asked,
very sarcastically.

In the interest of keeping my
objectivity as a sportswriter and
really nbt wanting to get into a
discussion with three tipsy,
overzealous Duké fans, I found a
table with my friends and
concentrated instead on the
insurmountable task which lay

I 6 ahead——deciding what toppings

we wanted on our pizza.
Anyway, I. thought about her

question. Why was I so surprised?

Maybe because Duke was a

NCAA

double-ﬁgure underdog coming
into the game. Maybe because
Vegas was unbeaten in the 34
games prior to this one and was
riding a 45-game win streak dating
back to last season. Maybe
because the boys from the land of
stage showsand slot machines
were one of the most heralded
No. 1 college basketball teams in
history. I thought I had plenty of
reasons to look surprised.

Well, we all know how that
game turned out, and the media
will inevitably be jumping on the
Blue Devil bandwagon and
praising a team which is certainly
worthy of such accolades.
However, A from watching that
game, it dawned on me not how
great Duke was, but what a

by the standards of
anyone who knows anything
about the Runnin’ Rebels. Duke
was razor-sharp, and UNLV was
bafﬂed. UNLV succumbed to
Duke’s slower tempo, were
absolutely miserable from the
floor and made some critical
mistakes.

And the Rebs still took it down
to the wire when they should have
been losing comfortably late in

the second half. In short, they,.

manufactured a contest even
when they played one of their
worst games of the season.

" They shot 45 percent (31 of 68)
from the floor, which isn’t bad.
But many of those points came as
a result of the Rebs’ tenacity on
the offensive boards. Their

Well, the NCAA’s 53rd
annual Big Dance is coming to
its conclusion with tonight’s
Kansas-Duke championship
game. This year’s tournament
has had its moments, just as
every past one has. UNLV’s\
hoops dynasty has ended
before it really began (don't
forget, the Rebels will be on
probation next year), and the
Duke Blue Devils continue to
build one of their own. With
that in mind, here are some of
the highlights and lowlights of
this year’s tournament:

Best Game: OK, so it's
virtually impossible to single
out one game as the best.
Everyone will have his or her
own favorite, though, and
while most will pick
yesterday's UNLV-Duke
classic, I still have to say the
best game was Utah’s 85-84
second-round victory over
Michigan State in double
overtime. UNLV and Duke will
be more memorable because
it was in the Final Four, but
this game had it all: clutch

‘Imported’ athletes starting to dominate track events

By Greg Wallace
suqr Writer

When one hears the word
“import, " an image of an alcoholic
beverage in a green bottle sent
from overseas is usually the first
thing that comes to mind. But in
the world of collegiate athletics,
the foreign, imported athlete is
becoming more and more
prominent.

Foreign athletes are starting to
move their way into big—time
college sports like basketball,
where Andrew Gaze (Australia),
formerly of Seton Hall; Nadav
Henefeld (Israel), formerly of
Connecticut; and Dikembe
Mutombo (Zaire) of Georgetown
have been household names in
the world of college hoops.

In collegiate track and field,
foreign athletes have not only

been in this country for quite a
long time, but they are also
starting to dominate certain
events. According to Pitt track
coachjohn Vasvary, the inﬂux of
foreign athletes in track is nothing
new.

“It’s been going on for a very
long time,” Vasvary said. “There
has been a constant battle within
the group of NCAA coaches, since
some are trying to put a stop to it.

But there really hasn’t been
anything that they can legally do.
Every action so far in the courts
has been thrown out.”

The only action that has been
taken so far concerns age limits.
In the past, a foreign athlete who
was 28 to 29 years old could
compete at the college level. The
combination of age and
experience would wear down the

‘young American athletes and

hamper their development.
Now, the NCAA has established
age limits to keep the meets
competitive.

“There are good and bad
points to having foreign athletes
on your track squad,” Vasvary
said. “It is good to know that the
Americans are competing
against top-ﬂight world athletes.
And if you have a foreign athlete

Hackett hopes to fill offensive hoies with 12 new recruits

By Derek Willis
Sta_[)"W1'iter

Beset by injuries a year ago, the
Pitt offense is looking for a boost
from the incoming class of
freshmen and junior-college
transfers. '

Panther, Coach Paul Hackett
welcomes back 10 offensive
starters, but the defection of
Curvin Richards to the NFL leaves
a big hole in the backfield. Injuries
played a key role last year, limiting
the playing time of several players
and leaving the Panthers without
depth.

Hackett signed 12 players on
offense, hoping to shore up

several positions, including

quarterback. Two—year incumbent
Alex Van Pelt has a lock on the
starting job, but Pitt inked two
high-school signal-callers.

Ken Ferguson, who is 6 feet 3

inches and 195 pounds, is from 
Arlington, Tex. One of four «

players recruited from the Lone

Star State, Ferguson passed for 3

2,702 yards and scored 20
touchdowns as a senior.

The other quarterback, John
Ryan of Youngstown, Ohio, hails
from the same high school as
Bernie Kosar. Both Ferguson and
Ryan completed over 50 percent
of their passes last year.

After a disappointing 3-7-1
record in 1990, the Panthers
signed two Parade All-
Americans, one each on offense
and defense. All-American wide
receiver Dietrich Jells from Erie
Tech Memorial High School could
be an impact player if eligible.

, The tight—end position was
another concern. Pitt returns Dave
Moore and Eric Seaman, who both
saw extensive action last year.
Since both will be in their ﬁnal
year of eligibility in 1991, the
Panthers signed three players at
that position.

Junior-college All-American
Rob Coons is from Fullerton
Junior College in California.
Coons was primarily a blocking
tight end at Fullerton, which ran
an option offense.

The other tight~end recruits

include local star Chad Skrocki of
Perry High School and Marcus
Harper of Houston, Tex.

Texas continues to be a big
recruiting area for the Panthers.
Curvin Richards and Kevin
Williams are Texans who made
the trip north to Pittsburgh. “I
think the players from Texas will
have a great impact,” said Hackett.

Three running backs also
signed with Pitt, including local
product Curtis Martin of Taylor
Allderdice High School. A first-
team All-State player this past

Imports

Continued from page 11
or two on your team, they might
have some different thoughts or
ideas when it comes to training
and learning through cultural
differences.

“The drawbacks are that it hurts
the development of the American
athletes in certain ways, especially
the distance runners. The foreign
athletes coming in are so good
that the standards to get to the
top meets are increased and more
difficult to achieve. Maybe the
American won’t make it to the
NCAAs until their junior year.
Meanwhile they’ve lost that
development. " '

In the NCAA indoor champion-
ships two weeks ago, Pitt sprinter
Elbert Ellis came in second place
behind Washington State’s Tony
Li in the 55-meter hurdles. Li is
also the Chinese national
champion and will probably be
representing his country in the
upcoming Olympic Games.

Although this event was a good
example of the U.S. success of
foreign athletes, they usually
excel in distance running and field

events.

“This year was probably the
exception rather than the rule
because the Americans did very
well in the indoor champion-
ships," Vasvary said. “But it’s the
other way around in a lot of
events, especially from the half-
mile and up. Many of the field
events have been dominated by
foreign athletes. ”

Panther distance runner Keith
Dowling has had to run against
many of these foreign specialists

. at the top meets. Dowling seems

to enjoy the challenge of facing
some of the best in the world.

“They are always there, and
you have to race against them,”
he said. “They make some great
competition, and that can only
work to my advantage to make
me better. The only drawback
would be that they take some
scholarships from American
athletes.”

Besides the problem with a
lack of scholarships, Vasvary said
many coaches abuse the use of
foreign athletes.

“Unfortunately, some coaches

are going out and buying their
team,” Vasvary said. “In those
cases, there is no serious coaching
going on. They feel that they are
paid to win, and they will do
whatever it takes.”

As far as the Pitt program is
concerned, Vasvary enjoys
gaining his athletes locally.

“Basically, our team is made
up ofathletes from Pennsylvania.
We do get some from New York,
Virginia, Maryland, Ohio and
even North Carolina.”

Although the dominance in
collegiate track and field is
becoming more prominent,
according to Vasvary, the
American athletes are working
harder and beginning to have
more success on the track.

“'lhe American athletes are
coming back and winning a lot of
events,” Vasvary said. “The
competition can only make the
Americans better.

“Many of the other coaches say
that the foreign athletes work hard
and have a good work ethic, and
it rubs off on the other members
of the team.”

Rampa

Continued from page 10
perimeter shooting was ice-cold,
with the exception of leading
scorer Anderson Hunt. Hunt
finished with 29 points, going 11
of 20 from the field with four of
those coming from three-point
land. Greg Anthony connected
on only eight of 18 shots and was
the only player to foul out. His
absence in the last 3:51 dealt a
fatal blow to the Rebs’ chances.

UNLV pulled down 40
rebounds to Duke’s 26 and had to
rely on nearly half of those boards
turning into second-chance shots
on the offensive end to make up
for major initial miscues from the
field. College Player of the Year
Larry Johnson turned five of his
13 rebounds into 10 points after
the Rebs’ sharpshooters
consistently missed their mark
from outside.

George Ackles had only seven
points, played tentatively in the
second half due to foul trouble
and lent a slightly softer touch to
UNLV’s inside game.

In keeping with the theme of
having an off night, the Rebs gave
away a five—point lead with 2:30
to go. Duke sharpshooter Bobby
Hurley was permitted to put up
an uncontested three-pointer, and
Brian Davis connected on a three-
point play shortly thereafter.

And what were the Rebs
thinking about during their last

,

chance to salvage a win? After
Christian Laettner hit two free
throws to put Duke up by two,
Rebel head coach Jerry Tarkanian
had the 6-7 Johnson, an inside
power player, bring the ball
downcourt.

Initially, it looked as if that crazy
strategy might have its merits.
Johnson, who was 2-2 from three-
point range, stood in trey land
after crossing the time line with
nothing between himself and the
hoop exoept air. He opted to forgo
the shot and pass to Hunt, who
was double covered and way out
on the perimeter. Hu nt’s shot was
wild and hurried, and he wound
up firing a classic brick. Even
Pitt's Tim Glover, notorious for
his long (very long) range antics,
was probably at home thinking,
“Hunt will never connect on that
shot!"

Regardless, the Rebels will
probably watch Saturday's game
tape like it was a horror movie.
They'll have their hands over their
faces and may split their fingers
every once in a while to watch a
good part.

But for those who watched that

game, you saw one of the best‘

college basketball teams play one
of their worst games and still
almost come out of it one step
closer to a second consecutive
national championship.

went something like this: “That’s
a good, hard foul. I like that; I’d
like to see players do that more
often. You never know if
someone will hurt his shoulder
and not be able to shoot the rest
of the game.”

Who let this guy on the air,
anyway? Someone please tell Bill
that intentionally hurting players
on the other team is not the object
of the game. Incidentally, the foul
was obviously unintentional and
looked worse than it was. Sorry
to say, Bill, that Bailey got up
and was OK.

yesterday as UNLV’s Anderson
Hunt was going up for an easy
dunk. Hurley went for the ball but
made sure that Hunt had no
chance to make the shot. It was
good, hard-nosed, competitive
basketball.

Classiest Move By A Runnin’
Rebel Player: Is this a
contradiction in terms? After the
above foul by Hurley, UNLV’s
Larry Johnson drew a technical
for protesting that an intentional
foul should have been called.
Hunt, however, went over and
patted Hurley on the back,
acknowledging that he made a
good play. It’s nice to see that
while other UNLV players were
whining, Hunt realized that Duke
wasn’t going to give up easy
baskets any more than UNLV
would.

‘Least Classiest Move By A

UNLV Coach: UNLV head coach 1

Jerry Tarkanian for berating the
Duke program in an interview on
ESPN Friday night. Tark had some
good points to make about the
differences between the two
programs, but he really didn't
come across well at all. Duke
Coach Mike Krzyzewski, who was
on Sportscenter live when he
heard T ark’s remarks, handled the
situation beautifully and defused
a potentially volatile situation. The
point is, Coach K should have
never been put on the spot like
that in the first place. Duke runs
probably the best basketball
program in the country, and
Tarkanian’s comments just
sounded like sour grapes.
BestIndividualPerfo1-mance
For The Whole Tournament:
Temp1e’s Mark Macon. Macon
took the 10th-seeded Owls farther
than anyone could have asked
him to. He scored 96 points in
four games and despite exiting in
the regional ﬁnal, was named the
East Region’s Most Valuable
Player. For his final college game
Macon returned to the
Meadowlands, where as a

freshman in 1988, he shot only 6-
for-29 as top-ranked Temple lost
to Duke in the East Region ﬁnal.
With 31 points against North
Carolina in this year’s game,
Macon erased the memories from
1988 that have followed him
throughout his entire college
career.

Hurley deserves mention and
should be tournament MVP if the

Blue Devils win the
championship.
Best Individual

Performance, One Game:
Smith, Michigan State-Utah. Smith
scored 28 points against the Utes
and time after time refused to let
his team lose. He just couldn't get
enough help from teammates Matt
Steigenga and Mike Peplowski.
“Nothing was left on the floor,”
said Utah Coach Rick Majerus. He
wasn’t kidding.

Two freshmen deserve special
note: Arizona State’s Jamal
Faulkner had 29 points and nine
rebounds against Arkansas in the
second round, and Pitt’s little-used
three—point specialistTim Glover,
whose 12 second-half points
brought the Panthers back from a
10-point deficit in the first round
against Georgia. By the way,
Faulkner could have been wearing
a Pitt uniform for this tournament,
but he couldn't meet the
university’s academic

       
   
     
     

requirements. Yeah, right. Iwon’t
laugh if you don’t.

Biggest Upset: Richmond over
Syracuse, of course. This was the
first victory ever for a 15th seed in
the tournament. Penn State’s ﬁrst—
round upset of UCLA only comes
close because the Spiders are
getting to be old hats at this.
Remember Indiana in 1988? The
best thing is that-Orange fans will
probably have to remember this
game for a long, long time. With
NCAA violations looming on the
horizon, they may not see the
tournament for a few years. Pity.

Now before all of you hoops
junkies out there get out your
pencil and paper to write in about
what a crackpot I am, think about
this: Most of you probably
remember different bests and
worsts from this tournament, but
that’s precisely the point. The
NCAA tournament means
something different and leaves
different memories for every
basketball fan who watches even
one game.

That’s exactly what March
Madness is all about.
