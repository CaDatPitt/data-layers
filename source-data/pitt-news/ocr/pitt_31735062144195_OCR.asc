Celebrates Charter Day

“The University Family” of
Chancellor It-;§?1_H. Fitzgerald, in-
cl-udin"g"‘the alumni, faculty, stu-
dents,-"‘ staff, and trustees, cele-
brated -the 159th .-anniversary of
the ~foundi.ng of Pitt and 50 years
of c'Qe£duc«ation in
Foster- memorial, Thursday, Feb,"
rudry 28. _"

Dr. Fitzgerald received the of-
ficial tribute of the General,rAlu.m-
In ‘association, which spbnsored
Charter day. The,‘ general chair-
man, C. Stanton Belfour, intro-
duced. the Chancellor. and other
speakers on the program.

In speaking of the 10,363 stu-
dents enrolled at Pitt of wh-om
4,939 are veter.ans, Dr. Fitzgeral-d
sai , “Large numbers are not es-

pé ially . signinﬁ-cant- The. —si-gniﬁ--

cance lies in. that these have ‘been
carefully ad-1nitted.'.j'§1-"frior to the
opening of the -present semester’,
over 12,000 have been interview-
ed, most ofwhom were veterans.”

Helen Pool Rush, dean of wom-
en, discussed the 1~0,0~0«0 women
stu ents -who have graduated
from Pitt since the fall of 1895.
“Ever since that-day,” she added,
“Women have always been far
outnumbered by men except for
war ‘periods. This has given them
solidahrit-y_ and ‘unity which has
hel.pe‘d'-th‘e women as individuals
and as groups. Women -of the
faculty, wives of members of the
faculty, ‘alumnae, and undergrad-
ua,‘tes—V. have stood -together and
wdrked together. All branches of
the University have been open
to us. We have had a chance to
workand study side by side with
men as equals.” She named sev-
er,‘-al women graduates of "Pitt whr
have achieved outstanding posi-
tions in the various professions.
Miss Rush spoke for Miss Louise

‘ Wright, president of the Alumnae

association, who could not attend
because of illness.

ILH-ighlights in the long history
of Pitt were related by ‘Dr. John

' W. Oliver; head of the history,de-

versity of .2300 students to one- of
14,8010 in 1941, and was respon-
sible for many of 'Pitt’s great
buldings, one of which was the
Cathedral of Learning. He added
that the responsibility could not
fall to a more worthy leader than
Dr, Fitzgerald. .

One‘ of the most impressive
speeches of the evening was made
by Mayor David L. Lawrence,
who said, “Pittsburgh and the
Unive‘sity of Pittsburgh have
grown strong together and will
work together
come. The University is part of
Pittsburgh, and will have every
amount of assistance the city can

give it. We want Pittsburgh to be

as great a center of arts and sci-
ences as it is of industry.” He
stated further that, “Pitt has un-
dertaken to provi-de a maximum
degree of education for returned
war veterans. No school in the
country has or could do more.
It is an example of what we
should do for the men and wom-
en who went out to -preserve free-
dom for the world.”

Senator John  Walker ad-
dressed the group in behalf .. of
Governor Edwar-d Martin. The
other speakers included Herman
J. Knell, president of Student
Congress; Hon. Joseph A. Rich-
ardson, and G. Dixon .Shrum,
president of the General Alumni
association and representative of
the trustees. ‘Dr. C. Lloyd Daugh-
erty, minister of the Smithﬁeld
Street ‘Methodist church, offered
the in-vocation and pronounced
the benediction. ' .

A portrait of the “father of
the University, Hugh Henry
Brackenridge, who founded the
Pittsburgh Academy in 1787, hung
on the stage throughout th=e pro-
gram. It was painted by Gilbert
Stuart, and was purchased. from
a‘ descendant in 1928 by Dr.
George Hubbard Clapp, the presi-
d_ent of the -board of trustees.

Hostess Explains it
Organ Recitals

In the Heinz Chapel Monday
through ‘Thursday at 1 o’clock
Russell Wichmann, University or-
ganist, presents organ recitals. .

The program is. posted every
day on the bulletin board on the
ground ﬂoor by Miss Jean Robin-
son, the Chapel ‘hostess and new
assistant to the dean of women.

Miss Robinson, a graduate of
Muskingum College, New Concord,
Ohio, Class of 1944, has her office
in the Chapel. “The chapel is, and
should be a very necessary part of
University life,” she said, “the
organ recitals in themselves have
cultural val.ue. Further, they add
music to the factors of architec-
ture, engineering and art which
are richly uniﬁed in the Chapel
to awaken spiritually and response
to beauty. Listening to music in a
quiet and beautiful setting gives
the busy student ’ hp-portunity "to
gain perspective in his ‘own. life.”

C iigress Urges
Strong Support
For Book Drive

M Although some books already
have been turned in to the Stu-

dent Congress book drive, many '

more are needed before the cam-
paign can be considered a suc-
cess.

, Student Congress, in an attempt
to at least partially solve the ex-
isting textbook shortage, has.

book‘ library of the scarce text-
books will be established in the
Reserve book room. A booth_
where books may be turned in‘
h-as been established on the
ground floor of the Cathedral of
Learning. '
= Publishers have been unable to
fill completely t'he University or-
der, and many students are with-
out textbooks. Because of a labor
and a paper shortage some books
will not be available until the
end of this month. In some classes,
as many as two—thirds of the stu-’
dents do n-ot have textbooks. A
list of the needed books was
printed in last week’s Pitt News.
Lists are also available at the
Library committee’s booth on the
ground floor. . ’

The Student Congress plan calls
on students to lend those of the
needed textbooks which they may
have at home to the Library com-
mittee, which will in turn estab-
ll5Sl‘1 a textbook library in the
Res'e'rve book room. Under he
pl-an students -may make use of
the books in the library, bu-t they
may not take them out.

" Betty Jane Wood.,chairman of
the, Student Congress Library
committee, stressed the fact that
although the campaign has been
going on for almost a week, still
many of -the students do not re-
alize just what Student Congress
is‘°p1anning to do. She emphasized
that students who contribute their
books are not giving them away.
They are merely -lending them to
Strident Congress. Each contrib-
utor will -be given a receipt for
his book.

The campaign will end Wed-
nesday, Mar-ch 13, one week from
today- '

he committee stressed the fact
that the books needed are books
not in print and books which
can not be obtained for three
wfeeks.

UNNRA Drive

iWomen’s Speech association
will meet with representatives of
Young Women’s Christian asso-
ciation tomorrow afternoon in the
Swedish room from 2:30-3:30

In addition, most

organizations on campus, including honorary fraternities, will be

asked to donate.
A The campaign starts today when

University -will solicit students
during the second and eighth hour
class periods. They will also so-
licit in classes during the third
hour tomorrow. On Friday, stu-
dents who were not solicited may
make volunteer contributions at
the Red Cross booth on the
ground floor of the Cathedral.
Organizations

This year, most organizations
on campus are being asked for
a contribution. ,“We are anxious
that these organizational dona-
tions ‘be truly group gifts and not
excuses for individuals in those
to refuse to‘ contribute
during the individual drive,” said
Jack Ellis, student chairman. “For

this reason, we suggest that the‘
-organizationgmoney not be raised

by assessing members, but rather
from the organization treasury.”
A list of organizations contrib-

’uting will be published in the
Pitt N-ews.

Since. there are over
students at Pitt, the University
Red Cross committee, under the
direction of Helen Pool. Rush.
dean of "women, feels that there
is every hope of student dona-
tions alone exceeding last year’s
total donations. Last year, Pitt’s
cont_ribu.tion to the Red Cross

drive was $8'047.'09. Of that
amount s t u d e n t s contributed

$1732.28, while faculty members
gave $6314.81.

; No Pledges
?A Red ‘Cross sticker and an
emblem will be given to every

person who donates. In this carn-
paign no pledges will be accepted.
S‘tudents are asked to make do-
nijations when the solicitors con-
tact them-' or on Friday at the
Red Cross booth. Checks should
 ma-die paya-bl-e to the Pitt’Stu-
d;_ent Red Cross Fund. ,_
fin its appeal this year, the Red
Cross is stressing the fact that 83
per cent of its ._activities will in-
v‘-olve men and women still in
service and their families, and
vreterans and their families. The
feeling that although the war is
over, the need f: r the Red Cross
is not over was expressed by
General Dwight Eisenhower in
these words, “Until every Ameri-
can in uniform overseas is home
again, the Red Cross will be call-
ed upon to play a major role in
contributing to his comfort and
well-being.” In addition to its
servicemen and veterans activi-
ties, the Red’ ‘Cross will continue
its traditional educational and as-
sistance programs. Among other
things, the Red Cross has long
olayed a major role in disaster
relief, water safety, home nurs-
ing, nutrition classes.‘ ﬁrst aid",

Vets Presented
Constitution

At the Veterans association
meeting Friday, March 1, John
Grimes, the president, presented
the new constitution to the mem-
bers, and described its provisions.
The constitution is as follows:

1. To enable unadjusted vet-
e r a n s to re-habilitate
themselves in their associ-
ations with people, thereby
bringing, about a closer and
more understanding
friendsliip.

To ease the strain arising
from the vigorous study
program the veterans face
in their readjustment, in
order to give them the op-
portunity to more fully en-
joythe activities of campus
life. ‘

To make available to all
veterans any suggestions
which will aid them in cop-
ing with the diﬂictilties
arising from their studies
A or personal problems.

Two main projects which the as-
sociation has undertaken to solve
are the housing difficulties and
the locker shortage at Pitt. Pro-
gress is being made to ease both
situations, ‘and the association
hopes to announce the successful
completion of both problems soon.

Dance committees are being
formed along with committees for
inter-mural activities in the field
of -sports. ‘The association hopes
that there will be an all-out par-
ticipation by the veterans in the
activities of their association.

Acutcis the only wordlfor the textbook shortage at Pitt.

The situation is not only. appalliiigbut should make every
Pitt studcntt ashamed of himself. ‘ A .

Textbooks are desperately needed; in some cases as many
as two—thirds of the class _do not have books. And the distress-
ing fgature of this urgent need is that most of the classes for
whic_l1__therc are not eiioﬁugh textbooks are largely made up of
veteI''a,ns. , V . . . . . _

If we, Pitt students, fail to ‘cooperate with this drive, we
will bedeprivlng some veterans of the educational bone"-fits
p1.‘olniscd them. A in ,. _ :

Lack of support for this drive, thus far, can only be at-

younever “got aroiindi’ to looking through your home library
for it. \V"e feel positive no Pitt student would be uiiwjlling to
give his fellow students his support insuch a. cause-particularly
where, as we have said before, so many of the students in need
of help are veterans.

There are 30 diiferhnt books which are iiecdcd. I_lowever,_

one copy of eaclibook will by no "means sat.i_.s:l’y the need. If
you have lost the list of scarce textbooks wh_ichwas p1.1l)lisl1eCl

no longer needed. Books collected-will be placed in the Reserve

An. estimate shows that alnjiost every 11p1;>c1‘cl.ass1i1a11 in the

Last year the imperativeness of contributing to the Red
Croissiwas undisputed; this year there  no reason tofeel that
there is less cause to give, and give gcnerously, to the organi-
zation. The duration is still in effect, and the war is not over
untll we bring every servicemen and Woman home. Vile have
a responsibilitty to not only those who fought for us on the
battle-ﬁeld, but to those allies who aided us in destroying the
aggressor nations. This program in which we are part.icipating
is signiﬁcant in the way th_at_ it will advance human bettc1_'men.t
in not only our conimunity, but in all :t-he coinmunities through-
out thc World. ~

The national Red C1‘os‘s,goz1l of,$100,000,000_ is $25,000,000,
less than the anticipated expenses for a 12-month period. We
should make an earnest attempt to go over our total of elast

Some, weeks back, a_ federal,

committee on something: or other
met and discussed the housing
problem. A After some deliberation
these great minds decided,,a) that
the housing, situation was bad,‘ b)
that it would get worse, and c)
that there wasn’t much that could
be done about it. _ A . .
In regard to housing here at Pitt,
there existed possibility of the

University contracting" with .the'‘'

F.H.A. for the erection of, emer-
gency housing" units onlor near the
campus. We use “existed” ad-
visedly because that past tense
adequately describes the situation.
The University has decided-that
the need for emergency housing
here is not as critical as it is else-
where and for that. reason‘ has
abandoned its efforts to obtain
temporary housing units.. Atﬁrst
sight, that decision seems unbc-e
lievably unselﬁsh. It isbased on
the promise that the students, ,at
Pitt are for the most part residents
of the immediate area and as such,
have established, homes, y.rhi~ch
undoubtedly is true.. However to
rather high. piercentageof the vet.-
cran student body have mgarried
prior toreturning to school and
have a reluctance to sharei their
family life with various and sun-
dry inlaws. They have an?:'i.nde-
pcndence born of their service ex-
perience and because of such have
a desire to be on their own and not
dependent on others. We feel that
certain determinations should have
been made before the tenfporar

housing project was discontinue. .
For example, a survey made, to de-

Jock. -Ivan Birsic was "most ex-
plicit; “it’-s very simple,” he said,
“it just mirrors the kind of people
you’ve known all your life, only

seem . . ‘‘'That’s right,” inter-
rupted Fishkin, “on the surface it
seems to be impressionism, but it’s
actually realism.”

“Yes,” reﬂected Jim Crow,
“that’s it exactly. It's a human

“Nothing really. Just looking for

script we found out what all the
talk had been‘ about.

This is whatsaroyan himself
wrote abouttthe play: “the real-

can travel. Giant plow-trains will "plant” much of this

 are plans to link coaxial cables and high frequency

Lee Reslimes

Band Duties

John Edward Lee, C’46, has
"returned to Pitt and the Pitt
band. Lee left Pitt for active duty
in the Army Air corps in 1942 and
after c o m p let i n g navigator’s,
school was graduated as seclond
lieutenant. .

He was assigned to a heavy"
bombardment crew and was shot
down over Rumania, where he was
captured and spent six weeks as
a prisoner of war. Returned to
the States and -discharged. Ed is
now back at Pitt. He completed his
course in the undergraduate
school, and is now in the Graduate
school.

Ed’s official title in the band is
that of graduate manager, a new-
ly created title on the band staff.
However, due to his wealth of ex-
perience in the past ‘he has been
taking care of several other du-
.ties. He has been pinch hitting as
librarian, ha-s been taking charge
of instruments, besi-des playing a
clarinet in the concert band. With
the return of other experienced
ijormer bandmen, Ed has been re-
lieved of some of his extra duties.
As a graduate manager he will
.now be concerned -with the ad-
ministration "of . band details.

Chalk up Miss Emily G. Irvine
as one faculty member who was
deﬁnitely “on the job” as far as
“On The Town” was concerned.
Spurred on by a keen interest in
the twelfth ﬂoor project, Miss
Irvine, an assistant professor of
English, worked entl1usia.s1:ically
contracting for program ads and
selling tickets for the recent bene-
ﬁt performance.

In qualifying -for the title of
the campaign’s “Super Salesman,”
she sold a hundred dollars worth
of tickets to a long list of pros-
pects and only one person proved
immune to her sales talk. During
the drive, Miss Irvine made an

It’s All Piﬁia Over Phi Ep

wo-Way Tie  F Loo;
PiKa's Beat Pl1Eps25-23

With the PiKA’s nosing out the¢

Phi Eps 25 to 23, the IF basket-
ball league was thrown into a two
‘way deadlock. -Since the Phi Delts
and P'iKA’s have already met, the

championship will probably have,

to be decided in a post season
game. Both the Phi Delts’ and the
-PiKA’s have lost only one game
and with little competition re-
maining on their schedules it ap-

pears as if both will end the sea-’

son with only one defeat.
In the crucial -game of the week,
the PiKA’s beat the Phi Eps 25

to 23 in the waining minutes of a"

closely contested game. The mar-
gin of victory lay on the shoul-
ders of John Gallagher who has
played brilliantly throughout the
entire season and has been the

keystone in all the PiKA’s victor-~

ies. Last Tues-day night it took
Gallagher three quarters to get
warmed up, but when he did, it
spelled defeat for a game Phi Ep
aggregation. Both teams exhibited
great teamwork which has been
so ‘characteristic of these ball clubs
throughout the season. ‘The Phi
Eps led. all during the first half
due to the ﬁne shooting of Dic-k
Seewald. Late in the third quar-
ter Jack Bloom startled. the crowd
with a mid—ﬁoor pitch shot that
put the Phi Eps ahead 21-19.
From then on Gallagher took com-

mand of the situation and‘ sank,

three straight set shots which put

the game on ice for the.I?iKA’s.-

In the other games of the week
the 'Pi.KA’s swamped the Delts,
54 to 26, the SAE’s trounced the

Pi Lams 34 to 18, and the 3 Phi,

Gains took a forfeit from
ma Chi’s.

WAA Cagcrs
In Final Tilts
This Weeli

Coming down the stretch of the
WAA basketball tournament, a
two-way tie between the freshmen
and the seniors looms large. One
game remains on the! schedule,
pitting the juniors‘ against the
sophomores this Friday at 12:39
o’clock in the Cathedral gym. If
the sophs defeat the juniors, a
three-way tie will result. Playoff
games between the two or three
teams will take place next, Week,
the schedule to be announced after
Friday’s game has been played.

Last Friday the seniors edged
out the freshmen in a tight battle,
23-20. Ruth Czapiewski led the
point-getters with 12 tallies for the
upperclassmen, and Mary Balinski
followed with nine. Peggy Dailpy
and Nadine Zernich scored eight
apiece for the losers.

The freshies turned right around
and scratched out a 5-10 win over
the juniors Monday in a game
which was nip and tuck up until
the ﬁnal period. The point-get-
ting twins, Peggy Dailey and‘Na-
dine Zernich, accounted for 13 of
their team’s 15 points, with seven

and six respectively. Dorothy
Dragone garnered ﬁve for the
juniors.
