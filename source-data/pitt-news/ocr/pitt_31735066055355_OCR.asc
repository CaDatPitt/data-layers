Kappa Sigma loses

appeal of

Erin Lindeman
Senior Staff Writer

Pitt’s Kappa‘ Sigma fratemity learned
Wednesday that -it lost its appeal of a
University decision to suspend it for a year
for violating an off-carnpus housing rule.

But it didn’t hear the news from the
University. ,

Kappa Sigma President Nick Moraites
said reporters from both of Pittsburgh’s daily

newspapers approached him about the situa-
tion. But it was news to him.

He said he doesn’t want to comment
about the situation until he gets ofﬁcial word
from the University.

“I’m very upset that people are asking
me questions, and I don’t have any answers.
I’ve not been given any paperwor ”
Moraites said

But Pitt spokesman Ken Service con-

tends the University mailed a letter to

Moraites on Monday to inform him of the
University’s decision.
Moraites said the last time the
University had made a decision regarding
. the case, it kept the information ﬁom the
media until it was sure he knew of the deci-
sion.

Piﬂ rule

“[Pitt doesn’t] care about the students.
They just want their money,” he said in
regard to not being infonned. “Perhaps they
sent me something. I have no idea. But what
good is it now?”

Robert Gallagher, the interim vice chan-
cellor of student affairs, was the only person
to make the decision on the appeal."

Service said this decision. exhausts '

Kappa Sigrna’s possibilities as far as
University procedures go. The fraternity

' can’t appeal again.

Gallagher said Kappa Sigma stated in
its appeal a number of reasons why the judg-
ment was unfair, among them that Pitt
shouldn’t be able to tell the fraternity where
it can live. _

“However, I found no merit in the
points they made,” Gallagher said. “We have
established a policy of not recognizing new
off-campus fraternity houses. We have also
clearly stated the punishment for violating
that policy.” ,

The University informed Kappa Sigma
on Nov. 9 that it would be stripped of its
recognition as punishment.

Gallagher said the fraternity now has

nation. And while the state House’s
Subcommittee on Higher Education
in a recent resolution recommended
that the Pennsylvania Higher
Education Assistance Agency make
more grants available to non-tradi-
tional students, assistance may be _a
long time coming.

“Resolutions don’t hold the full

force of law,” said Ann Dykstra, Pitt’s I

director of Commonwealth Relations.
“Each one of these recommendations
is really going to need further action.”
The Subcommittee on Higher
Education spent more than five
months ‘researching higher education
in Pennsylvania, primarily studying
tuition costs. It submitted a list of
twelve recommendations to the

General Assembly on Nov. 23.

ate students are employed full-time,”

Patrick Terenzini said nothing
could be farther from the truth now
and, most especially, in the future.

“The idea that the typical college
student is between 18 and 24 years
oldand is enrolled full—time on a res-
idential campus is - false,” said
Terenzini, a professor and senior sci-
entist at Penn. State’s Center for the
Study of Higher Education. “We’re
trying to dispel some of these com-
mon beliefs.” T‘ .-

Terenzini said private and public
universities can expect to experience
a deluge of older, working students
looking to further their education in
the coming years. He said traditional
schools are not ready to handle this
type of student.

“There is relatively little financial
aid for students going to school part-
time,” Terenzini said.

This doesn’t bode well for stu-

. ..  . , , . experts say col-
leges and universities must do a better
job reaching out to students who have
careers and families to take care of
outside of classes before they choose
to go elsewhere for their education.
“Some new suppliers are entering
the marketplace, and they are show-
ing that they can get the job done,”
said Frank Newman, president of the
Denver—based Education Commission

of the States, an organization that ‘

analyzes education policy throughout
the nation. “The current situation has
invited investors to enter the educa-
tion market to make money because
the public and privates are not run-
ning efficiently.”

Recently, higher education has .

seen the advent of the for—profit insti-
tution, a school set up like a corpora-

tion with stockholders interested in ‘

making a profit. Because these types

Nezlah Bradley, a
Pitt junior, said she
feels she has to
prove herself to
professors because

she's black.

Blackstuclnts feel the

weightof stereotypes

Christal Hall
Staff Wrlter

When Trenia Parham first came
to Pitt, she knew that undergraduate
studies would be stressful, but she
never thought she’d have to carry the
weight of her entire race on her
back. ’

She’s not alone.

That’s the way many African-.

American students feel when they

are among only a few black people

in predominantly white classrooms.
“Regardless

something to prove to my teachers
—‘ that black people aren’t stupid
and we can do the work if we are
given an equal and fair chance.”

But it’s hard to get a fair chance
if some of your teachers think that
just because you’re black, you’re
going to cheat on tests.

“Some teachers assume if you’re
doing well in their class that you’re
cheating,” Parham said.

She said she and three of her
friends decided to sit_in the back of
class oneday during_a quiz, and the
teacher stood

if you like it or
not, you are the
representation of
black people that
white people    4. ». .
see,” said Parham. “I personally can-
not represent every black person. I
can only represent me. Plus, they are
going to stereotype you anyhow.”
Parham said she doesn’t try to
justify herself to anyone. It’s even
harder when you are one of only two

 

black people in the class and the'

other black student doesn’t want to
talk to you. ,

“I don’t try to battle with them. I
just make sure all my work is done
on time, and I make sure "I get a B or
better,” Parham said.

Pitt junior" Nezlah Boardley
agreed with Parham. .

“Sometimes, I felt like I had

next to them to
see if they were
cheating.

“That was
really ignorant,”

   
 

I rhm said. “fter class, I was talk-

ing to one of my friends about it, and
he must have heard me because dur-
ing the next quiz, he didn’t do it.”

She said another stereotype that
bothers her is the idea that black stu-
dents only get scholarships because
of their race. She added that a lot of
black parents cannot afford to send
their children to college with their
income alone.

“Even though they received
money because of the color of their
skin, that doesn’t mean that they
don’t deserve to be here,” said

versities, they can afford to keep their
tuition lower than competitors. They
can also concentrate on catering to the
non-traditional student by offering
primarily evening courses, class-
rooms close to major highways, and
degree offerings» in such popular
fields as computer technology, health
management, and information sci-
ences. ' ‘

Pennsylvania, as recently as last
year, changed state law, allowing for-
profit institutions like the University
of Phoenix to offer four-year degrees,
something they were prevented from
doing in the past. Right now, the
Phoenix-based institution is looking
at Philadelphia and Pittsburgh as pos-
sible cities in which to expand.

“I’m not sure [campuses] can
increase efficiency in higher educa-
tion because of the fact they are labor-
intensive,” said Jackie King, director
of federal policy analysis for the
American Council on Education.
“And now campuses need to be wired
[to the Internet], and that adds cost.
Plus, salaries go up. It’s not like a fac-
tory where you can introduce robots
and decrease jobs.”

She said the bottom line is that
while tuition isn’t spiraling out of
control like it didin the 1980s, stu-
dents still have to worry about rising
costs.

“I don’t think you will see tuition
go down,” King said. “We’re still not
back to where we were in the 1970s,
and I’m not sure we will ever get back
there.” '

She said one of the few places
where states can make budget cuts is
in education, since most states cate-
gorize it as discretionary funding.
Because it competes with prisons for
money, sometimes education looses
out. Add greater state interest in pro-
viding support for basic education
and hesitancy on the part of taxpayers.

tion, and an unbalanced equation soon -

ondary schools. '

“We need to maintain the highest
quality education that we can,” said
Peter Balcziunas, executive director
of the Pennsylvania Association of
Colleges and Universities. “We are
not just competing locally; we are
competing with other higher educa-
tion systems, and we are even com-
peting globally.”

Some of the state’s colleges and
universities are taking things into
their own hands.

The Pittsburgh Council on Higher
Education consists of 10 institutions,
two public and eight private, of which
schools such as Pitt, Carnegie Mellon,
Duquesne, Point Park and the
Community College of Allegheny
County belong. By sharing resources
and technology and allowing students
to cross—register with schools in the
system, the council has succeeded in
saving costs.

“The PCHE presidents are cur-
rently considering some highly sig-
nificant collaborations, such as the
possibility of sharing one or more
recruiters who would focus on bring-
ing more students from outside of the
county to all of the. institutions, or
working on a distance learning pro-
gram,” said Katherine Henderson,
president of Point Park College, to the
Subcommittee on Higher Education
in July.

But many feel cooperation
between schools still won’t be enough
to curb rising tuition costs or stem the
approaching tide of for—profit institu-
tions — schools that may educate stu-
dents but don’t necessarily contribute
anything in the form of research or
jobs to the community.

In the face of these issues,
Pennsylvania’s legislators feel power-
less to offer any guarantees on the
issue of higher education, particularly
tuition costs. E

“Any significant change is not
going to happen -overnight,” said
Ronald Cowell, an Allegheny County

Democrat who recently completed his '

term as “state representative. “It is

' CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (U—WIRE) —
Decked outwith a scowling Grinch tie and a
pin with Santa hanging upside down from a
chimney, author Tom Flyrm enumerated the
evils of Christmas for members of the
Secular Society Tuesday night.

Flynn, a senior editor of Free Inquiry
magazine and author of “The Trouble With
Christmas,” said he is known as the “anti-
Claus.” He stopped celebrating Christmas in
1984. -

“I enjoyed nine quiet Decembers. Then
I wrote the book, and ever since, radio sta-
tions have called me [on Christmas]. to see
me, to check up on me,” said Flyrm, who
said he now spends his holidays at the ofﬁce.

Flynn predicts duller Christmases in the
future.

“Christmas has become a net loss as a
socioeconomic institution,” he said.

Flynn left the Roman Catholic Church
in 1979 when he ﬁnally realized he was an
atheist after years of wrestling with his
beliefs. _ -

“If Jesus Christ is not your savior,
Christmas is not your holiday,” Flynn said.

In 1982, Flyrm researched an article on

Christmas for the Secular, Humanist-

Bulletin, of which he is a founding editor.

According to Flynn, the ancient practice
of Christmas died out between 1790 and
1820 but experienced a revival during the
Victorian era.

He said the holiday’s present form was
developed by six “DWAMQs: Dead White
Anglo Males and a Queen.” -

Flyrm listed Washington Irving; Charles
Dickens; Clement C. Moore, author of “A
Visit ﬁom Saint Nicho ,” or “‘Twas the
Night _
before Christmas”; Francis Church; and
Thomas Nast as DWAMQS. Queen Victoria

. was also implicated, he said

“Aside from Dickens, few realized
what they had done; otherwise, they proba-
bly would have run, not walked, from the
dustpan of history,” Flynn said.

Heasserted that an early belief in Santa
Claus breeds distrust between children and
parents and may warp chi1dren’s moral and
religious development.

“[Christmas is] an elaborately sustained
parental lie,” Flynn said. “I urge all parents to
give Santa Claus the ax.”

' Flynn said prejudice againstthe yule—
free can be traced to two distinct ﬁgures:
Dickens’ Ebeneezer Scrooge and Dr. Seuss’
Grinch.

“Christmas critics remain one of the
few minorities against whom it is socially
acceptable to discriminate,” Flynn said.

Nevertheless, Flyrm said Christmas is
on the decline because of the growing num-
ber of  Whereas in the past,
acceptance and assimilation served to
imprison minorities, Flynn said today
minorities tend to be assertive about what

~ makes them unique.

“If today’s new outsiders  demand to
be respected, Christmas can’t continue in its
role as a universal public idea,” he said.

He suggested that all religions be treat-
ed with the “same uniform, benign neglect

‘under which non—Christian faiths have

always grinded.”

He conceded, however, that Christmas
will not disappear as a holiday but rather
draw back - V

Flyrm emphasized that the recent origin
and accidental development of Christmas
traditions can and must be rolled back,
beginning with secular humanists’ emer-
gence from the closet.

He urged the society members to let
others know about their beliefs.

“How many people in your life know
that you’re an inﬁdel?” he asked “Saying no
to Christmas makes a strong message.”

houses under construction, or challenge the
University’s decision in a court of law.

Pitt is building ﬁve or six fraternity
houses on the hill near Pitt Stadium and,
according to Gallagher, the ﬁrst ﬁaternities

“Can the University legitimately have this

The policy was enacted in February
after numerous anests and difﬁculties with
other fraternities.

“The policy says that any student orga-

4 Parham. “If they get accepted to Pitt,

then they can be here.”

Some black students even feel
they are stereotyped for the way they
dress or the styles of their hair.

“If your hair is not long and
permed, and your clothes are not a
certain brand, then people tend to
associate the way you look with your
academics,” said Parham. “Although
that’s not only students; it’s profes-
sors.”

Parham added
that ‘some people
judge others’ abili-
ty to speak proper
English if they
don’t wear stylish
clothes.

“If you don’t
look a certain way,
then people think
that you can’t
speak eloquently,”
she said. “Whether
it’s a student, fac-
ulty, black or
white, some people
think that. I don’t
say anything about
it because I know
where _I stand. I
just let them look

stupid.”

Pitt senior
Harry Mudd said
many African-

American students
become discour— .
aged when they come to Pitt because
they don’t feel comfortable.

“They have a lot of expectations
when they come to college,” he said.
“Some think college is going to be a
good social environment and a great
academic experience. They need to
find their niche.” .

Mudd said a lot of African-
American students don’t feel com-
fortable because a lot of Pitt profes-
sors have a research-first attitude.

“They give the student the infor-
mation on the board, give the test,
and make it so that it’s easy to grade.
If we had teachers first and
researchers second, then we would

have students succeed,” said Mudd.

“I don’t feel comfortable in my
classes. Being" an English major,
they have a lot of classes on
Shakespeare but not on Langston
Hughes or Claude McKay.
Everything is European—based,”
Boardley said.

cal action chair of the Black Action
Society, encourages students to
become involved on campus. He said

“ T h e
University and the
city don’t make
the students feel
comfortable,”
Mudd said. _“The

problems __with

Stereotypes can do a lot to stu-
dents’ self-images and can‘ even
make them leave the University.

Mudd said, “When I was in one
of my political scienceclasses, this
white guy said that most black peo-
ple in the inner city are on welfare. I
told him that everyone else is being
subsidized by the government -
that’s why they are rich.”

Mudd added that comments like

- those could offend black students

and make them want to go home,
where they feel accepted. -

“The University needs to look at
the strengths of the past and use
them for the future,” Mudd said. '

EDITORIAL

Save your state money: Get your
degree behind bars

With tuition costs at public uni-
versities constantly rising much
faster than the inﬂation rate, it is

important that this issue be
addressed now.
While the state House’s

Subcommittee on High Education’s
recent submission of 12 recommen-
dations to the General Assembly is a
step in the right direction, more
must be done to help counter the
disturbing trend of skyrocketing
tuition.

Tuition has increased due to col-
leges’ technology improvements,
the increasing cost of hiring faculty
and staﬁ’, and the expansion of cur-
rent programs and establishment of
new ones to be able to keep up with
the changing times. However, the
state’s funding of public universities
has not kept pace with these increas-
ing costs.

As recent efforts to combat this
have shown, studies by committees
lead only to recommendations, reso-
lutions within resolutions and gener-
al political background, maneuver-
ing. Concrete action has to be taken
to get the increase in tuition rate to
stop. »

When it comes to budget cuts,-
some of the ﬁrst made are to fimds
allocated to post-secondary educa-

tion; Most states, including

Pennsylvania, categorize spending
on higher education as discre—_

tionary, not mandatory, funding.
Education, in effect, is not consid-
ered a priority, as it competes with
prisons for funding. If a gimg-ho

anti—crime legislator comes into the-
General Assembly and decides to’

spend more on prisons, then the
most likely victim of this spending
would be funding that would usual-
ly go toward public universities.

It is better to educate society
than to incarcerate it. It is a given
that most people who ﬁnd them-
selves on the inside of a jail cell do
not have much high-school educa-
tion, a symptom of poor schools in a
squalid inner-city setting.

Not enough funding is going
toward education for the kinder-
garten through 12th grade group,
which means that public universities
also have to compete with primary
and secondary education.

Other steps must be taken to
keep tuition down, particularly on
the universities’ side, to cut costs,
improve eﬂiciency, and keep the
quality of education high.

Students are already paying
enough. It’s time to stop these
above—inﬂation tuition increases.

_‘‘We’re not standing PAT,” the new carn-
paign slogan that has been launched to mark the
new and improved “gold service” of ﬂie Port
Authority Transit, is already a few car lengths
away from being an  success.

Not only does the Port Authority have its
name on a number of billboards in Pittsburgh,
but it also is receiving a heavy stream of atten-

' tion through the very discreet changes of the

overall appearance of its buses.
Take for instance the “Miami Vice” bus,
which is adorned in a splendid array of pastel
pinks and blues. It is visible at any time of the
day ripping along Fifth and Forbes Avenues.
VV1thoi'1t reservation, I say that the advertis-
ing campaign is indeed-crafty. The Mrs. T’s
pirogi bus is an interesting outreach to the hard-
working proletariat of the South Side. Another
new decorative bus is the Eight O’Clock Coffee
bus, which appears to have a dual appeal: the
aﬂluent mug-sipping esquires and those early-
to—rise urbanites who are either
(again) laborers or underpaid secre-
taries. Either way, the calfeine bean
bus is a spectacle diﬂicult to miss.
Apparently, there has been no
diﬁiculty at all in missing these

buses. By examining the quarterly report of the .

Port Authority’s success based on the past three
months, one will note that there have been three
separate incidents of Pitt students being clipped
by such busses. And Monday night’s accident,
when a bus plowed into a car on Fifth Avenue
outside Schenley Quad, is yet another example
of Port Auﬂ1ority’s unyielding pursuit of “gold
service.”

These accidents beg the following ques-

“ tion: Why does the Port Authority hire drivers

who seem to be willing to strike pedestrians?

I suppose what I’m attempting to say is that
if I were the individual responsible for phoning
a student’s parents_to explain to them that their
son or daughter was struck by a Port Authority
vehicle, I would wish to include that the driver’s
eyes were those of a drunken rabid heroin-
induced animal. It at least would put pressure on
Port Authority’s insurance policy!

It is just extremely unfathomable how a
professionally trained operator of a vehicle,
employed by a reputable organization, can be

careless enough to -actually hit a person crossing _

the street. What could be the rational excuse?

Port Authority service hardly Iden

KEVIN

CAREY

COLUMNIST

 

The pedestrian was walking without his head-
lights on?

In defense of the Port Authority, to some
degree, the entrance to die Schenley Quad is the
manifest of some hellishdream that a crooked
engineer had one sobering night The blueprint
was most likely drafted by a former PennDOT
employee shortly after his dismissal. So for that
accident, I feel that a legitimate excuse is at
hand. There is _ a deﬁnite blind spot to that
entrance.

That, however, is only one mild justiﬁca-
tion m an obviously ongoing crisis. In approach-
ing the dilemma as a whole, I ﬁrmly believe
both the Port Authority and Pitt are at fault.

I directly blame the Port Authority because
there is no doubt that its drivers operate their
vehicles in a haphazard, dangerous rrianner.
That is not a ﬂagrant attempt to only blame the
drivers. The fact is that these drivers are exposed
to a rather costly level of anxiety.

Foremost, the drivers are con-
stantly weathering the harassment of
the various people who rely on pub-
lic transportation. In addition, the
scheduling of Port Authority drivers
is done in a rrianner that most often
has the operators work on a split schedule. This
basically entails that the driver works a 12-hour
day, driving for four hours, resting for four
hours, and ﬁnishing with another four—hour
shift. I ultimately identify the Port Authority’s
work schedule as the cause for such accidents.

Consider being a‘ driver and enduring such

- a drawn-out day. It is evident that your attention

to detail is going to suffer.

As stated earlier, I also reproach the
University, for it has demonstrated no effort to
rectify this problem. Students are here to pursue
an education. In" theory, this is true, and they pay
an exorbitant amount of money-to do so. There

is an allotted amount of dollars of that tuition ‘

directed for security purposes. The general fear
of being rim over by a bus should not exist, but
now it does.

Someone should be prompt in amending
this complication before some poor bastard gets
killed .

Kevin Carey feels that an underground walkway
is the answer but concedes that sexual assault
would then be a problem

Fisher Price: seﬂing fire to America’s children

Jennifer Stoltz'
Columnist

Fisher-Price Inc. recently recalled
one of its best—selling, longest-available
toys. The Power Wheels rider toy’s bat-
tery has caused more than 850 com-
plaints of ﬁres, injury, smoke or melting.
An ofﬁcial from the Consumer Product
Safety Commission called it “a ﬁre wait-
ing to happen in your home.” So why are
we only ﬁnding this out now, more than
800 complaints later? And why is Fisher-
Price only allowing 400 service centers
in the country to do the repairs?

- While this doesn’t affect the typical
college student to any great extent, we
all probably know .a relative, friend or
neighbor whose children have one of

1, these toys. Somehow, somewhere, some-

one we know could be affected by this.
These cars have been sold since
1984, when I was 5 years old. I remem-
ber that my friends and my then-3-year-
old cousin had the them. I took many a
ride in those Power Wheels. They were
as close to the “grown-up” version that
we could get for another 10 or so years.
We do enough damage with the real
thing; we don’t need accidents from the

ATHIE PITT. NiEws: OPINIONS

toy version. In fact, now, almost 15 years

later, my two little cousins, ages 2 and 6, 4

have one. Needless to say, their parents
aren’t letting them use it right now. It’s
just frightening to think of the danger we
are putting ourselves and our loved ones
in.

It has been
reported that the
first notiﬁcation of
c o m p l a i n t s
occurred in late
1996 and early
1997, when fire
investigators and
consumers came
forward. So why
are we only now,
in late 1998, learn-
ing of this? Fisher-
Price has let this
danger linger for _
almost two years. Who knows how
many more children got hurt? Who
knows how property was damaged?
Thankfully, none of the incidents report-
ed were serious or large-scale. But big or
small, they happened, and the bottom
line is that they shouldn’t have hap-
pened. .

  

. 4' §
CATHLEEN O’MArrEv STAFF ILLUSTRATOR

Also, only 400 centers in the United
States are going to be able to fix the
Power Wheels rider, and that is only
going to be after a few weeks’ waiting
period for the parts to come in. A manda-
tory video must also be viewed, after
which inspections of sample repairs

' must be done
before customers
can receive their
own repairs. I
understand they
are just trying to
bethorough, but it
also seems that
they could be
more efficient
about it. Most like-
ly, they’re trying
 __ to avoid class-
‘ .. ‘ action lawsuits.
Officials of
Mattel, which owns Fisher-Price, have
said that the incidents are “rare” and the
recall is “preventive.” I wouldn’t call
850 complaints “rare,” and the best “pre-
ventive” measure would have been to
test these toys ahead of time for prob-
lems like this. If Fisher-Price and Mattel
had allowed this to "go on, they would

have been a lot more than $30 million in
the red, which is the quoted ﬁgure that
will result from this recall. ‘ _ .

The only larger recall was -a few
years ago when there were small toys in
cereal boxes that posed choking hazards.
The Consumer Product Safety
Commission is going to investigate the
toy company to see if the agency was
told about the hazard in a timely fashion.
My guess is that it was not. i

I just can’t believe that there are
companies in this country that could
knowingly take a risk with America’s
children like this. They know how well
the toy sells. They know the ages target-
ed by the market. Two- to 7-year-olds are
not going to know to run if a battery
starts smoking. '

We need to get over the bureaucratic
red tape and the fretting over lawsuits
and get our priorities straight. We’re

talking about kids. One of the things in

our country that I thought was sacred.
Guess the safety of our future doesn’t
mean much to Fisher-Price and Mattel.

Jennifer Stoltz will not be buying her
young relatives any toys by F isher-Price
or Mattel for Christmas this year

Thanks for the high side ei higher education

Chris

Taschner

I have been asked by the Intercollegiate
Council to write to all of you to thank you
for being so cooperative. For years, univer-
sities everywhere have been growing due to
increased public interest in higher educa-
tion. Your eagerness to obtain your middle-
class licence has truly inspired us.
Enrollment is at an all-time high, especially
in the liberal arts.

We wish all of you (especially the lib-
eral arts majors) the best of luck after grad-
uation, but we would like to remind you that
we can’t guarantee any jobs out there. But
with your enthusiasm for college, you prob-
ably won’t be out of school for another 10
years or so anyway. This love of school will
provide you with absolutely no extra

knowledge, but at least you will be under"

mommy and daddy’s wing for a few more
Years» .
Furthermore, the IC would like to
thank you for passing your days in college
with alcohol. As a result of student drinking,
we are able to demand higher tuition in the
name of controlling the drunk and disorder-
ly. Where would we say the money was
going if all of you dried up? Your college
might be forced to actually provide better
classes and better teachers with better ideas
who might just take the better jobs. While
these intelligent professors might provide
you with a greater understanding of the
world, they "won’t provide you the grades

you should be handed. They would ordinar-
ily challenge you to come up with these
grades on your own, which is not what you
want, obviously.

We at the IC would like to thank all of
you for being the hellions that you are. VV1th
your reputation for drunkenness and disor-
derly conduct, we can cram you into dorms
and apartments unﬁt for human existence.
We can do this with the-knowledge that no
matter who complains ‘or what attention it
gets, we can say that the students created the
problems. Thanks to your reputations, we
don’t have to wony about repairs or over-
crowding, which has saved your college
enormous amounts of money. .

We’d further like to thank you for pass-
ing the days watching campus sports
instead of doing homework. Without your
enthusiasm for sports, you might actually
study and get out of college on time. More
importantly, without your enthusiasm for
sports, we couldn’t get those state grants for
all those new sports complexes — com-
plexes that will end up paying for them-
selves in a few years anyway and for which
every university already has enough money
to build thrice over without the grants.

We would most like to thank you for
making our job so easy regarding the cur-
ricula If it weren’t for your demand for easy
courses, we’d actually have to come up
with challenging curricula. The kind that
make you think The kind of cunicula in
which you have to read large and important
books and learn large and important theo-

rems and do large and important amounts of
studying just to have a shot at passing. Not
like the classes you have now, where you
don’t even have to show up to anything but
the tests to get a C, which is all anyone ever
needs anyway. Classes where the books are
only there to provide your college with a lit-
tle more revenue. Classes that leave the stu-
dent’s mind free to ponder the massive
amounts of booze to be consumed follow-
ing class. These are the classes you, the stu-
dent, want. '

We would like to thank the smarter stu-
dents, those.students who actually think and
maybe study once in a while, for going
along with things. We really appreciate the
fact that even though you really aren’t being
challenged and you probably realize that the
university is little more than a retailer, you
have decided that you can live with that.
Even though we’re selling an overpriced

piece of paper with absolutely no guaran-

tees and no redeemable value, you continue
to buy it.

We thank you for not once going to any
one of your professors, no matter how slow
the class is going or how incompetent the
TA, and asking the professor to improve the
class. We thank you for never being inclined

. to approach your university’s chancellor to
ask him why building a new sports complex -

is a higher priority than putting a computer
lab in the computer science building. We
thank you for never actually changing any-
thing in your student government. We thank
you for all of this and for all the millions of

daily trivialities you, the gifted’ student, turn
a blind eye toward Mostly, we’d like to
thank you for selling that lazy, unintelligent
student that test you aced or those notes you
took or that paper on Japanese folk music
you wrote in high school because you
helped the grades even out and made one
more student think that maybe this year he
or she would actually graduate.

If it weren’t for you, the student, we
might actually have to think and to solve the
real problems of the university. So please
carry on. Keep going out all night and get-
ting. blitzed and high. Please only take the
easiest classes, no matter how much your

mind might ache for knowledge. Above all, 9

please keep supporting those sports teams
because what would we do without sports?
Don’t wony that you might be rrrissing out
on something, some intellectual side of col-
lege that no one has seen for years. Don’t
worry about your future or about the fact
that there are about 10 million fewer jobs
out there for psychology majors than there

are psychology majors or that all you can do-

with a degree in art is starve.

Don’t worry about anything, because
you’ll always have those wonderful memo-
ries of college, not to mention that great
piece of paper that you put off so long to get
to prove you were here even though it prob-
ably isn’t worth the ink it’s printed with.

Chris ‘Taschner, usually in your face with

cartoons, is now in your face with the print- '

ed word

   DePasquale 

  embodied Pitt sports

‘ Pitt’s athletics department suffered a

qmajor loss this weekend.

 Tllere were no defections ﬁom the

» basketball team. No one was injured on
A the football ﬁeld. No teams were axed
j from.,the athletics program.

_ 'I'hisloss was not on a playing ﬁeld; it
was in the pride of the athletics department
and the Pitt teams. V 

' Friday night, Anthony DePasquale
passed away at the women’s basketball
game at Duquesne.

Firstand foremost, this is a tragedy for ‘

his family and friends, but he will be sore-
ly missed on campus, as well.

Judging by the way this_Panther fanat-
ic lived his life, he would not have wanted
to be anywhere else.

DePasquale, a 20-year old student at
Pitt, spent much of his ﬁ'ee time cheering
Pitt teams. He was a ﬁxture at football,
men’s basketball and women’s basketball

1 games.

Last year, DePasquale sat at the end of
the court and watched the games. He could
always be seen wearing Pitt Panther gear
and smiling.

This year, he was made a student
manager. DePasquale spent much of his
days and nights with the basketball team,
taking stats at the games and still always
smiling. ..

DePasquale, relegated to a wheelchair
because of his muscular dystrophy, sat
behind the Panthers with his notebook,
constantly writing. '

Someone would come by and take his
stats and give them to the team every so
often. He sat behind the bench beaming
with pride over the work he did

When he was not working, he was
one of Pitt’s biggest fans. He didn’t miss
games and never gave up. He stayed with
the teams until the end.

The athletics department needs dedi-
cated fans like DePasquale.

The athletics department has been
looking for people like him for a long time.
Steve Pederson and his staff must be frus-
trated every once in a while when they see
the apathy of the student body.

DePasquale showed he was exactly
the opposite of most of the student body.
He had a passion for the school and its
sports. '

When you are sitting at the basketball
game Saturday, think about this great Pitt
fan, and cheer your hearts out. It is the best
tribute you could give to DePasquale.

And the Panther hoops team will
leave him smiling down on the campus for
a long time ifit beats UConn.

St. John’s

 

coach Mike Jarvis substituted four men
with 12:15 to go in the first half in an
effort to exploit his team’s depth. At
first, Jarvis’ move appeared to backﬁre,
as Pitt went on a run. Isaac Hawkins put
in a jump hook to get the Panthers with-
in one at 15-14. Jarrett Lockhart came
into the game with ﬁve quick points,
and suddenly the Panthers were up 21-
19. Ricardo Greer’s steal led to a
Hawkins jumper, and Pitt had a four-
point lead.

With Cummings taking a rest,
Jeremy Holmes came in to- run the
point. Hohnes led the transition play off
of a turnover and gave it to Lockhart,
who dished to Hawkins for a jam that
gave Pitt a 25-19 lead.

St. John’s came back with a 9-0 run
of its own, including an offensive
rebound by Thornton and a three-point
play by Tyrone Grant. Cosby got free
on the offensive end to keep the
Panthers close at 30-27. The Panthers
tied the game when Cummings gave a

when it visits the Pitt Panthers
Saturday at noon.

There_won’t be any snow out-
side, but the Panthers are hoping for
a white out inside Fitzgerald Field
House. Pitt fans are being encour-
aged to wear white‘ shirts to the
game.

“When you have the N o. 1 team
coming in, you want to make it an
especially hostile environment,”
said Pitt media relations director
E.J. Borghetti. “We think this is an
exciting, interesting idea to make
the Field House a more hostile,
electric place.”

All fans who wear white will be
given a free sports bottle.

The Huskies aren't the nation’s

No. 1-ranked team for nothing.
They are undefeated so far this sea-

well. As a team, they make more

It was a tale of four teams at-

Fitzgerald Field House last night, as
Pitt and Seton Hall reversed roles at
halftime.

The Lady Panthers outlasted the
Pirates in a defensive struggle, 55-
46, last night in the Big East
Conference opener for both teams.

Pitt played very poorly in the
first half, hitting on just six of 30
shotslfor a mere 20 percent. The
poor shooting allowed Seton Hall to
grab a seven—point halftime lead at
25-18. The two teams seemed to
have switched uniforms at the
break, as Pitt came out of the lock-
er room and drained one big shot
after another to take the lead and
eventually pick up the win.

Michelle Katkowski, one of
four Lady Panthers in double fig-
ures with 10 points, hit an early
three-pointer to give Pitt a 5-2 lead.
Seton Hall responded, going on an
11-0 run. Pitt could not seem to
break the 2-3 zone the Pirates were
showing, forcing shots as the shot
clock expired.

Senior Kortni Webb commented
on the defense that riddled the Lady
Panthers: “The post position didn’t
get the ball much, so we struggled

on offense.”

Alecia Balich hit her first of
three three-pointers to end the
Pirate run. Balich led the Panthers
with 15 points.

Seton Hall sophomore Starr
Fuller, who had a double-double
with 14 points and 10 rebounds,
dominated inside play in the first

half. She converted on a three-point-

play to give Hall their biggest lead
at 23-14 with 2:30 to go in the first
half. _

Pitt coach Traci Waites was not

happy with her team’s first-half per— .  

formance. .

“We weren’t looking to attack
the basket. We weren’t looking to
score,” she said.

She obviously inspired the team
during the halftime chat. The Lady
Panthers cut the Pirate lead-to three
early in the second half when
Nicole Whitworth found Katkowski
on a back-door layup.

Seton Hall did not score during
the first 4:46 of the half, but Pitt
could only cut the lead, to one. The
teams traded baskets in the next
five minutes. Balich, who came into
the game No. 1 in free-throw shoot-
ing, hitting on her_first 24 attempts
of the season, missed her first with
9:50 remaining in the game. The
shot could have tied the game.

Monique Toney (at right, on ground) knocked down six clutch free throws
in the closing minutes to seal Pitt's first Big East victory of the season.

It turned out that Pitt did .not
need the free throw. Big three-point
baskets by guard Monique Toney
and Balich gave the Lady Panthers
their first lead since Katkowski’s
early three.

Toney sealed the victory with
six consecutive free throws in the
last minute, improving the

Panthers’ record to 5-2.
Waites was thrilled, saying, “I
am so happy for our seniors. We’ve

been in last place for four years.

I’m just so happy we won our first
Big East game.”

Pitt will play next in the
Oakland Tribune Classic, Dec. 20-

According to Jeffrey Howderl, assistant
compliance coordinator for Pitt athletics, the
NCAA is trying to pass legislation that
would make creatine a non-permissible
expense for universities. That means that the
University would no longer be able to pay
for athletes’ creatine supplements.

Inlightofcertainhealthandliability
concems, Howden said the NCAA
Committee on Competitive Safeguards and
Medical Aspects of Sports recently recom-
mended that institutions not allow schools to
provide any type of muscle-building supple-
ments to stndent- athletes.

Thus, many universities have discontin-
ued supplying the substance to athletes. Pitt,
however, still supplies its athletes with crea-

to regulate creatine use because of the possi-
bility of long-terrn etfects; it also wants to do
so because of the possibility of larger schools
having an advantage over smaller schools
that may not be able to atford creatine or can-
not supply it consistently.

According to the NCAA committee, the
possibility of change came about because
several schools on a semester system
claimed they were at an unfair disadvantage
to those schools on a quarter system.
Howden said the schools argued that
because their academic year was shorter,
they could not supply their athletes with the
supplement over the same amount of time.

“By doing this, you turn the athlete out
into the street,” Morris said.

If the NCAA not only nixes the sub-
stance as an expense, but also goes as far as
putting creatine on its banned substance list,
Monis and Howden both agree it would do
more harm than good since there is little risk
for side eﬂ°ects and even long-term elfects.

“What are you doing by banning it?”
Howden said. “That would mean substances
such as red meat and protein pills should be
subject to being banned.”

Monis agreed but addressed another
concern about creatine becoming a barmed
substance.

“You open up Pandora’s box,” he said.
“If you ban a legal substance, [athletes] may

tum to other illegal substances.”

He said that athletes might be inclined to
turn to illegal steroids if the NCAA were to
ban ﬂie creatine. In McQ1rley’s case, Morris
monitors when and how much creatine he
should take for his workouts.

Morris said when he provides creatine
to the athletes, he uses the proper loading
parameters based on those set by Dave Ellis,
coordinator of performance nutrition at of
the University of Nebraska. Morris said he
and the University also consulted University
of Pittsburgh Medical Center dietician Judy
Younginger, who has done considerable
research on creatine and helped devise load-
ing parameters for athletes.

For those who take the substance, the
“loading phase” is period of ﬁve days at the
beginning of a six- to eight—week cycle,
when, depending on a person’s weight, he or
she takes 20 to 30 grams of creatine each
day.

This initial loading phase, according to
Monis, is a period of high creatine satura-
tion, which for the user means quick weight
gain, mostly from water.

“I usually take four tablespoons of the

powder for ﬁve days,” McCurley said.

After this phase, users usually drop
down to ﬁve grams of creatine taken 45 min-
utes before daily workouts. This is called the
“maintenance phase.”

At the end of the six— to eight—week peri-
od, a break period of the same length is nec-
essary to start the cycle again. Monis said
this is because the body will adapt naturally
to any foreign substance. Taking creatine for
a long time can result in this “adaptation.”

, Monis said he is going to start his ath-
letes on cycles of creatine beginning this
winter. _ .

“With some athletes, there is no differ-
ence between the loading phase and regular
dosage because they have adapted to the
substance and no longer are beneﬁting from
it,” Monis said; “Some weight-lifters I know
have been using it straight through since
1990.”

Outside of the world "of Fit athletics,
Jelf Irwin, a Pitt junior and creatine user, is
satisﬁed with gaining 8 pounds of muscle
mass in the ﬁrst month. At the end of each
month, he cycles his creatine by taking a
week off and sticks to a strict vegetarian diet.

“I stay away ﬁom red meat during this
time,” he said

' The reason Irwin stays away from red
meat is that it lowers the natural level of cre-
atinealreadyinhisbody.Eatingredmeat
would get his creatine levels up to where he
will not get the optimum perfonnance out of

his supplement. Creatine monohydrate is.

found primarily in red muscle tissue, so most
companies otfer amounts equivalent to that
found in about two pounds of raw beef.

Since creatine is already found in the
body and in the food he eats, Irwin’s week-
long vegetarian diet enables him to begin
another month of creatine supplementation
unadapted .

As for McCurley, Monis recommends
that he not take creatine during the football
season or during spring workouts. During
these times of the year, athletes are doing
more- conditioning rather than strength work-
outs, and creatine is not a necessary supple-
ment.

“The strength program must be format-
ted to ﬁt the many ditferent activities of the
student—athlete,” Monis said.

McCurley likes the substance and will
continue to take it to help his performance.

“As long as it is available, I will contin- 

ue using it,” he said.

half, it was 38-30 in favor of St. John’s.

The second half got off to an orni-
nous start for the Panthers, as Thornton
continued where he left off with a quick
bucket for a 10-point edge. Cosby came
back with a jumper to get Pitt within
eight, but then Greer had two consecu-
tive turnovers, and St. John’s capital-
ized on a jumper by Erick Barkley for a
46-32 lead.

Isaac Hawkins slammed down an
offensive rebound to get Pitt back with-
in 10, but Thornton came right back
with a three to put St. John’s up 49-36.
A three-pointer by Lavor Postell ‘put the
Red Storm up by 16 at 54-38.

Pitt was down 56-40 when the
Panthers made their ﬁnal run of the
game. Greer came alive with five
straight points. Cosby then made a
block at the defensive end and got a
dunk on the offensive end to get Pitt
within nine at 56-47. Greer made a free
throw in this run, which turned out to be
Pitt’s only trip to the charity stripe the
entire game: v

The turning point in the game came
right after the Pitt run, when coach
Ralph Willard was called for a technical
foul. The play occurred when Greer
appeared to have inside position for a
rebound butwas called for an over-the-

_back foul. Willard exploded on the

bench and was hit with a technical.

After the two technical free throws
were made, Barkley threw up a prayer
from three-point range and banked it in,
which gave St. John’s a 63-47 lead with
seven minutes remaining. The Red
Storm continued to pour it on at the end
of the game with dunks by Artest and
Postell, and St. John’s went on to win
by the score of 73-52.

After the game, Jan/is said that his
team “got a great all-around perfor-
mance”.

The depth was truly an edge for St.
John’s. As Artest noted, “We play 10
people. Most teams can’t do that.”

Pitt had 22 turnovers in the game,
compared to 15 for St. John’s. The big
discrepancy was at the line, where Pitt
had one free throw attempt, but the Red
Stonn got 15 tries. St. John’s out-
rebounded Pitt by a total of 17 to eight.

Cosby led Pitt with 12 points, while
Cummings and Hawkins each added
10. Thornton had 23 points for St.
John’s, while Artest added 15. Grant
added 10 points to go along with his 11
rebounds.

With the win, St. John’s is now 7-2
overall and 2-0 in the conference, while
Pitt drops to 7-3, 0-1 in Big East play.

The Panthers will host top-ranked
Connecticut on Saturday at Fitzgerald

Junior Richard Hamilton (20.7
points per game) is considered by
many to be the best college basket-
ball player in America. Hamilton
plays primarily as a guard, but can
play just about any position. He
was last season’s Big East Player of
the Year, and so far this year, he is
second in the conference in scoring.

Sophomore Khalid El-Amin

(15.8 ppg) was last year’s Big East
- Rookie of the Year.

The 5-10, 203-pound El-Amin
stands out on the court as much for
his short, stocky appearance as for
his play, but he does a superb job

directing the Huskies’ offense.

For the" Panthers, Vonteego
Cummings will try to match blows
with Hamilton. Cummings is third
in the conference, right behind
Hamilton, in scoring with 19.3
points per game. 

Isaac Hawkins, the top rebound-
er in the Big.East, will look to con-
tinue the outstanding performances
he’s had in the Panthers’ last sever-
al games.

Both Pitt and UConn played on
the road last night. The Huskies
defeated their archrival, the
University of Massachusetts, by a
score of 59-54. Meanwhile, Pitt lost
to No. 18 St. John’s, 73-52, in New
York City.
