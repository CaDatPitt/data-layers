i should ﬁrst experiment under controlled conditions. This
¢proposal would cover one area

only——the fraternities——-and would
cover only two trimesters from
September 1962 until April 1963.
This way we can observe the re-
sults closely, enforce the rules,
and revoke the action if neces-
sary.”

Under the proposal, the Uni-
versity “shall permit the use of
alcohol beverages, in the forms
of beer, ale, liquor and liquor
mixes, ay fraternal organizations
which are officially recognized by
the University of Pittsburgh.”
This would be extended to the
social fraternities recognized by
IF.

ltegulations Followed

The use of alcoholic beverages
would be restricted to weekends
between 3 p.m. Friday and 1 a.m.
Sunday. The proposal states, “The
University regulations regarding
social events conducted by fra-
ternities, including those regula-
tions which require chaperones
for all events which are attended

by women of the University, shall

be applied and enforced under
the terms» of this proposal.”
Pennsylvania laws regarding
the use of alcohol by minors
are to be observed by fraterni-“’
ties according to the proposal.

Evaluation

Scheduled
In 2 Years

By JACKI KATZ

Panhellenic Council has

bership quota for women’s
‘fraternities from 30 plus sen-

raise will beiin effect for a

four year trial period. At the end
of each year, the presidents,» with
the help of a Panhel advisor, will
evaluate the effect of the increas-
ed quota on that group. A

After the first two, years there
will be a ‘meeting of all presi-
dents for an overall evaluation of
the raise. If two-thirds of the pres-
idents feel that the raise has been
detrimental to the Greek system,
the quota will be dropped back
to 30 plus seniors.

If the increase has not been
dropped at the end of two years,
‘a final evaluation will take place
at the close of the four year period.
All chapter presidents, the Panhel
advisor and the Dean of Women,
will take part in this evaluation.
If at this time a majority of the
presidents feel that the raise has
been beneficial, it will be rais
permanently. ’

Members of various sororities
were asked their opinion of the in-
creased quota.

Raise Too Soon .

Kathy Grant of Alpha Delta.Pi:
“We didn’t want the raise now. We
felt it was better to wait till we
(got better established. However,
we are perfectly willing to go
along ith it. If everyone cooper-
ates, it will be a success.”

Sally Goldboro of Alpha Epsilon
Phi: “The quota raise in the sor-
ority system is a plan which was
‘long overdue at our expanding
University. Sororities serve an im-
portant function for college wom-
en, not only in providing friend-

spirit.”
Maureen Hanna of Chi
Omega: “If the sororities meet
the allotment, Greeks will have
a better chance of being known
on campus.” _
Pat Teeters of Delta Delta Delta:
“I feel it’s really a good thing and
that it will serve to better the
overall women’s Greek system.
The fact that Panhel and IFC are
working together and that the
pledges of all groups are uniting
is a good step.”
Presidents Agree

WPGH Installs Coaxial Cable

Device to Improve

Dorm Reception

Radio station WPGH is ins1;all-
ing a coaxial cable which should
let all dormitory students re-
ceive their programs.

The lO00—ft. cable will feed the
broadcast
vault in Bruce Hall. As it works
now the station feeds the im-
pulses‘ into one of ‘the cable’s
branches and they “sneak” over to
the main power source, being sent
from there into the dormitory
rooms through branch cables.

The loss of power from this
method explains the poor recep-
tion in the Quadrangle. The new
cable will reach directly to the
main power vault in Bruce Hall,
and should give 100 per cent re-
ccption in the dorms.

Dick Rauh, General Manager,
says of the new cable: “It will
be a tremendous step forward for
WPGH, of course. With the in-
creased audience we will be able
to put out better programs. It
should especially be a help dur-
ing basketball season next year,
letting all students hear the
games.”

“It is a duty not to discriminate

. The reasoning behind Panhellenic Council’s decision to
increase the membership quota of its sororities, as stated in
' V the presidents’ original ‘proposal, holds the key to the rea-
sons why the new rulings may very well negate their own
‘ purposes. a

One of the main reasons the plan was designed, the
‘A proposal indicates, is to lessen the burden of responsib_ility
and ﬁnancial strain of the individu,al members. By allowing
eachjsorority to grant bids for ﬁvemore members each year,
if Panhel has determined that the administration of the
I . groups’ functions and the upkeep of their suites will be

i.“each one will have more time to enjoy the many beneﬁts
of Greek life.” This, in turn, leads to the ﬁnal goal of the
- plan, which states that “There would be more Greeks to
‘support and strengthen the system as a whole.”

The possibility exists, however, that with “more
Greeks” on campus to support the sorority system, the size
A and perhaps even the number of their activities could in-
crease proportionately. The increased activity, of course,
iwould inexorably create more responsibilities. At the same
time, the increase in membership may require an adjust-
ment in groups’_ housing facilities which could prevent the
sororities from attaining their desired degree of cost cutting.’

But if possible drawbacks do exist in the new system,

the-most important one can be found by viewing it on a
long range basis. While there would be “more Greeks to
support and strengthen the system as a whole,” it also
I . seems probable that there would be less sororities.
_ This problem is obviously paramount in the minds of
the group presidents as their ﬁrst recommendation in their
A original proposal is that during the trial period of the new-
plan no sorority “be removed for lack of members until
the increased-quota has been thoroughly tested.”

The testing will be culminated with a detailed 13 point
evaluation which will be administeredgby the presidents.
The evaluation chart clearly shows that the Greek women
are fully aware ofvany and all foreseeable drawbacks of the
3 new rulings, including “proportionate ‘increase or decrease
in each group,” as well as the same in cost per member and
the individual’s responsibilities. N

It is most impo.rtant,»however, that the criteria be up-
-held during the two-year trial period, in which time tod.ay’s
freshmen will become sorority presidents, for a fair and
" complete judgement of the increased quota system.

Remember all those «sharp
clothes Mom and I bought before
I came here. Well they're nice
and all; I mean they’re TOO

really .need are some casual
clothes, like the girls wear here.

and nice l.ooking, you’re out ofit.

But that’s not my realproblem. The trouble is
that before I came Mom‘ and’ I bought a really
nice raincoat. You remember it i—- it was the best
one in the shopand it cost about $50. But that’s

too fancy to Wear around here.

had last year before you got your new one.

‘ Neo—_Nazis Called
‘No Threat Here‘

Editor, The Pitt News. V

A week after George Lincoln
Rockwell’s storm trooper
Pittsburgh, The Pitt ‘News warn-
ed students against letting Rock-
well speak here. “Rockwell,”- the
editorial said, is “searching for a
soapbox.” A demogague thrives on
publicity — any kind of publicity.

To bring this point home The

Pitt News has published three .

articles on Mr. Rockwell in the
last two issues. One of them
headlined on the front page got
-more space than Linus Pauling’s
talk. at the University. »

Just how serious a threat is the
American Nazi Party? Between
gasping about wholesale murder
and goaning over the 9000 party
members Matt Swetnoic and Stan
Stein left little doubt; neither did
self-assured Jim Vaughan who
refuses to be intimidated by
“Nazis” who may trigger “some
dorman“ thing within us.” For
the past four year Lincoln Rock-
well has been building the Amer-
ican Nazi Party whose 9000 m.em-
bersr will eventually’ expand to
the point of electing him president
in 1973.

In the meantime Rockwell has
yet to muster more than 20 at
one time of his 9000 members.
Demonstrations of his power have
been equally formidable. Last
summer storm troopers captured
a Jew Communist. ‘Before they

had little trouble in packing off
nearly the whole American Nazi
Patry in the back of a paddy
wagon. Of course, it’s impossible
to realize the total threat Lin-
coln Rockwell poses to our na-
tional security until he is com-
pared to Adolph Hitler as in Wed-
nesday’s Pitt News. Like Hitler
he knows something about getting
free publicity (before he gave up
working for playing fuereix he
was an advertising executive).

But let’s face it. This isn’t Ger-
many 1920. Rockwell’s chances of
becoming tfuerer are about equal
to Albert Schweitzer’s learning
the twist.

“Let’s see what this Nazi is like.
I’ve never seen one before,” cries
Jim Vaughan enthusiastically. I

Commencement

Date Questioned

Editor, The Pitt News:

About two weeks ago it wasan-
nounced that Pitt’s commence-
ment has been changed from Sat-
urday, June 9, to Monday, June
II. The reason given for this
change was that the previous date,
beinga Saturday, conflicted with
a religious holiday.

With sincere respect for all re-
ligious holidays; I can’t help but
wonder ‘if any 'considerati0n’was\
given to the inconveniencr of
holding commencement on a week
day. ~ ‘

Many students who have grad-

uated in April will have jobs far’

from Pittsburgh. This will neces-
sitate theirttaking several days
off work to attend their own com-
mencement. Even the student who
works in Pittsburgh will have to
take at least one day off. And
what of his parents and friends
who must also work andwould
like to attend his graduation?
Many colleges hold commence-
ment on a Sunday afternoon. This
should not conflict with anybody’s
religious interests for an occasion
of this type would blend very
well with the Sunday atmosphere.
I wonder if the change in
schedule which has been made for
us is satisfactory to the majority
of graduating seniors; or have the
past ‘four years of college so well
Conditioned us that we accept.

EDUCATIONAL TV: ITS CAUSE
AND CURE

A great deal of nonsense has been written about educational
tele\‘i.s'ion. Following is my contribution:

It has been said that television allots no desirable viewing
hours to educational and intellectual programs. This is simply
not so. For instance, you can see “The Kant and Hegel Hour”
every day at 4 am. This excellent show is followed at 5 am.
by “Kie1‘kegaard Can Be Fun.’.’ For such lazy scamps as lie
abed beyond that hour, there is a splendid program on Sunday
mornings at 7:15 called “Birds of Minnesota, Except Duluth."

So much for the myth that TV gives no prime time to educa-
tional prograins. Now let us deﬂate another canard: that TV
is not eager to inject intellectual content in all its programs.

If you have sat, as I have sat, with a television planning
board, you would know that the opposite is true. I was priv-
ilcged recentlyto witness a meeting of two of TV’s topmost
program deve1opers—both named Binkie T attcrsall.

“Binkie,” said Binkie to Binkie, ‘_‘if there is one thing I

“Right!” replied Binkie. “So let us put on our thinking
caps and go to work.” ‘

“I for,«,>;ot my thinking cap in VVestpo1't,” said Binkie, “but
I have a better notion: let us light a M;u-ll)oro.”

,“But of course!” cried Binkie. “Because the best way to
think is to settle back and get comfortable, and what is the
cigarette that lets you settle back and get co1nfortable‘.~”’

“I said M:irlboro,” answered Binkie. “VVe1'cn’t you listening‘?!

“A lull—ﬂ:ivo1'ed smoke is Marlboro,” declared Binkie.

“Rich tobacco, pure white ﬁlter, a choice of pack or box.
What is liettcr than a. .\larlboro?” _

“A l\‘l:u'll>oro and a match,” replied Binkie. “Got one‘.”’

Binkie lI.‘l(l, and so they lit their good Marlboros and settled
back and got coml'ortable and proceeded to cerebrate.

“First of all,” said Binkie, “we are going to avoid all the old

-“It Goes On

 

1 THE ATHLETE

Sir Thomas Fowell Buxton never coached» any success-
ful ba_ll clubs. Instead he was an English philanthropist
who achieved good with greenbacks. But he knew theseed
which harvested success, whether it be utilized in stuffing
bank vaults or winning sporting events.

“Experience shows that success is due less to ability

than to zeal,” he said. “The winner" is he who gives himself
«to his work, body and soul.’.’

A stroll about the Field House and the varsity practice
ﬁeld unlocked the meaning of this passage. An athlete
would meander by, casually casing the joint, trying to ﬁnd

    out the time.

Pace Themselves

' V “I don’t know,” a clock-less man would _answe.r. “But
you’re coach was up here a little while ago looking for you
guys”

Then the fellow would seize a basketball and flip a few
around, saying, “Yeh, but it’s not four o’clock ‘yet, and it’s
not time to practice.”

“Yeh, that’s why the hell you’re not playing,” the dis-
gruntled gent would mutter in disgust.

Disgruntled gent turns to me and says, “I get a kick

out of these guys. They act like it’s a damn job or some-

- thing. They'd never think about coming up here early
_ and practicing on their own for awhile.

“They talk to their girls until three fifty-nine, and then
they come to practice. It’s just a mechanical task.”

It’s the same old story that is re—run on every play-
ground in America, with a few rare exceptions. The big

kids loaf about, and the little midgets work like beavers for

nothing.
Robots In Arizona

. A trip to the varsity practice ﬁeld didn’t change the
 « thesis. Granted the dry ﬁeld felt like an Arizona desert, but

there were some prospects moving about like robots, list-
less, mechanical and dead. ,
They were there putting in time. Then right there

with them would be another fellow, in some cases, a vet- —

eran with near-security in his ‘position, straining and forc-
ing himself to his physical limits and beyond.
Maybe the oldtimers are right, maybe the kids to-.
day just don’t need enough, they just don’t want enough.
' Insome cases there are a dozen applicants for :1 Job on
the Pitt football team.
. The guy who just accepts his fate as the tenth or
eleventh man, and shows up for practice IS the same fellow
who is going to shuffle about an employment oﬁice someday,
puzzled by the fact that some little ferret got a job before
him.
Without desire you will go nowhere. “What do you

‘want most?” Doc Carlson wrote once. “To be happy. healthy

or prosperous? To be the school’s best student? To be‘ an
All—American athlete? .

“Do not be content to be mediocre, barely making the
squad. No one loses who was not at ﬁrst a loser in his
own mind. Books, speeches, and songs are ‘written about
the men who first had a deﬁnite desire backed up by an
unfaltering faith. And championship teams are made up
of them.”

No one can ﬁlleyour ear with more good words about
the values of sport. Carlson has an office at the Field House.
He’s a doctor and he can cure all your ills. Go talk to him
even if you’re not an athlete.

Mike Johnson Makes Home Debut
In AMA-AAU Wrestling Tourney

among them are Duff Killian, Bill
Brooks, Tim Gay and Paul Wil-
son. The tournament will pro-
vide a preview to next year’s mat
squad.

Amateur Athletic Union rules
will be in vogue. This calls for
an entirely different scoring sys-
tem. Points are given for losses.
If a wrestler is pinned he is
charged with four points, if he
loses by a decision he gets three
points against him. Once six
points are chalked up to a wrest-
lerhe is eliminated

Another difference in the
rules is that once a grappler’s
shoulder touches the mat he is
declared pinned.

Detect Good
Spirit Already

Ernie [Hefferle and Frank
Lauterbur are starting from
scratch to ﬁgure out who’s
who on the Pitt football team,
and the impressions that the
gridders make on them this
spring will go a
long way in de-
termining ber-
ths on the 1962
team.

“Lot of work
needed from
What I have
seen.” Hefferle
concluded after
a few day of
workout. “After
- - our first couple

Ernie Hetferle of scrimmages
I will know a little more.

“Gee, they’re good workers,” he
said with enthusiasm. “We have a
pretty good squad, and they seem-
ed to be enjoying everything that’s
been thrown at them, especially
defensive ‘ work.

Offensive Changes

“They’re a little unsure of
themselves, offensively, because
we’ve added a few new things to

   

our offense. As far as the ends go, V

to find a good receiver is going to
be hard.’-'-

Pressed for info on his end
charges, Hefferle exclaimed, “As
far as I’m concerned, the end
position is the most wide open
on the team. Kids who were
around here ‘last year, I wouldn’t
know. I realize that Grigaliun~
as, Long, Jenkins and Sobelew-
ski played a lot of ball last
year, but I don’t know how
good they are.”

“This (Ron) Robson looks like
he’s going to play a lot of ball,
and (Bill) Howley and (Ken) Es-
kridge look like good prospects
from first impressions.”

More Punch

“Gene” Sobelewski is starting to
put on some weight now,” Hefferle
added, “and he’s rather thin still.
He’s a tough kid but he’s got to
put those hard pounds on himself.”

Lauterbur, the former Army
aide, likes his tackles. Compar-

Soccerinen Start
Spring Sessions

Coach Leo Bemis, taking a cue
from the football team, sent his
soccermen through spring drills
for the ﬁrst time on Monday.
Bemis plans to run his charges
through drills three times_ a week
after classes.»

He expectsbetween 35-40 can-
didates to participate in the
drills with a few absent because
of- participation in other spring
sports.

Bemis is busy right now re-
cruiting some players for next
fa11’s freshman outfit. Last year
he was very successful in round-
ing up a trio of outstanding pros-
pects, and expects to‘ bring in
more this fall. ‘

“We are still taking on new
prospects,” Bemis says. “Any
student who is willing and wants
to tryout, need only come up to
the Field House and see me soon."

Kirk Pendleton’s Loss
Cause For Much Talk

By BOB

SMIZIK

Most of the talk around the Field House on Monday re-
volved around Mike Natvig’s amazing upset of Lehigh’s sup-

posedly unbeatable Kirk Pen

Pendleton had dropped down to the 147 pound
order to avoid meeting Oklahoma State’s Phil Kinyon at 157

pounds.

The strategy backfired when Nat-
vig edged him 5-4 in the finals.
Pendleton had smashed Natvig in
the Eastern finals, ll-2. '
Coach Rex Peery summed up
the match this
way. “Pendle-
ton went out
there with the
wrong attitude.
I-Ie almost had
Natvig in a pin-
ning position
e a rly in the

 

match. When
he didn’t get
t h e pin h e -

seemed to think
it didn’t make Rex Peery ,
any difference and that he could
pin. him (Natvig) later.

Natvig made a beautiful rever-
sal in the first period to tie the
score and after that Pendleton

played right into Natvig’s hands”,

One of the wrestlers’ was a little
more adamant in his viewpoints.
“After Natvig had ridden Pendle-
ton for a minute or so, Pendleton
seemed to quit out there,” t.he
grappler commented.

Almost as surprising as the out-
come of the match was the fact
that Natvigihad close to six min-
utes riding time against Pendleton.

Another surprising aspect of the .

tournament was the stalling pen-

alty called against Lehiglfs Curt,

Alexander. Lehigh considers itself
the citadel of aggressive wrestling
and often criticizes Pitt tactics.

Alexander had the stalling point
called against him in overtime
against champion-to-be Bill Car-
ter. It proved to be the margin of
difference in the match.

The Panthers’ sixth place ﬁnish
“disappointed” Peery, but he was
pleased with the third place finish
of Jim Harrison, who “looked real
good." .

Mat Future Brigh

Syracuse University’s wrestling
future looks bright. T hre.e
Orangemen won Eastern freshman
titles recently. They are 123-
pounder Terry Haise of Erie, Pa.,
191-pounder Gerry Everling ‘ of
Ginghamton, N.Y., and heavy-
weight Jim Nance,_ a rugged 220-
pounder from Indiana’, Pa.

llntra-Squad
Games Mark
Mitt Practices  

Spring—like weather has enabled
the baseball team to leave the
confines of the Field House and
head for Trees Field to get in
some outdoor practice.

Intra-squad games have been
taking up most of the team’s
time. In recent action Drew Wil-
1iamson’s squad downed John
Cioffi’s team, 6-5. .

Surprisingly, the hitters appear
to be ahead of. the pitchers at this
stage of the season. Cioffi and
newcomer Dick Wagner each
blasted out home runs and there
was an abundance of solid base
hits. —

If the warm weather continues
Coach Bobby Lewis should have
the team. in fine shape for the
opener against California State on.
April 12, at Forbes Field.

One problem that Lewis will
not have to face this year is a
shortage of pitchers. Last year
Lewis had to depend on a four

ments. This year there are 13
hurlers bidding for starting duty.

S G Alcohol Committee Submits Plan

(Continued from Page 1)
“This regulation is the respon-
sibility of the fraternities, not
the University,” Sobota stated.
“But the University has the
right to take punitive neasures
against any fraternity which
violates these regulations.” This
punishment would be handled
through IF. -~

Sobota explained that the pro-
posal was “presented in view of
the record of fraternities on this
campus in recent years regard-
ing their practices in the use of
alcoholic beverages.

“Off-Campus Compared

Fraternities now use alcoholic
beverages at “off-campus” events,
he continued. “To this date, few,
if any, incidents have occurred in
which, because of the effects of
alcoholic beverages, any frater-
nity has been the cause ofany
trouble or of any violation of the
law.’_’

This permission would be ad-
vantageous to fraternities, -So-'
botawent on,’since they would
be able to use their own facili-
ties instead of having’ to rent
off-campus‘ facilities. In addi-
tion, the University would have
more social events under its
direct jurisdiction.

Finally, the proposed states,
“Granting the permission to fra-
ternities to use alcoholic beverages
at social events would be a fur-
ther step in the social education
oi‘ University students: that is, an
education as to the proper use
of alcoholic beverages at a social
event.”

,lVIotion Tabled ,

The Senate decided to table the
motion to approve the proposal
until next week. From there the
committee will submit it to the
individual houses and then to
IF. If there is a positive reaction,

the proposal along with the min- .

utes of the committee’s meetings,
a summary of the questionnaire
results received from
schools, the questionnaires them-
selves, Rich Sobota’s recommen-
dation, and IF’s recommendation
will be submitted to Dr. Rankin.
At the end of-two trimesters, the
administration will decide whether
or not to make the action perma-
nent.
Award Suggested
In his speech to the group,
Nate Firestone reviewed the
three areas of student respon-
sbility that he deﬁned in his
Tap Day address—-academic
responsibility. responsibility to
campus activities, and respon-
sibility to know what is going
on outside the University.

He then ‘made suggestions for
SG to take action in these three
areas. First of all, to increase the
academic atmosphere ‘at the Uni-
versity, SG would award a cash
or honorary prize to promote the
excellence of research papers in
the natural and social sciences.

This award, along with the pos-

sibility of publishing the paper
and an honors banquet at the end
of the year, would give the stu-
dents initiative and would pro-
vide a worthwhile project for SG.
iHe mentioned the possibility
of a SG lecture series, like Mid-
day but scaled down.” Finally,
fora major accomplishment in
this area, SG could investigate
and analyze the effects of the
three—year-old trimester system
on University students. “This
would require the time, respon-
sibility, and maturity of the sen-
ators,” Firestone commented.
On the matter of campus acti-
vities, he suggested that SG limit
the number of positions a student
can hold in major organization.
“Not only would they build up
the value of the organizations, but
it would give more students who
deserve it a shot at leadership”,
In addition, the Senate could
activate the position of Director of
Student Organizations who could
submit a report on SG accomplish-
ments and check up on what the

Politics Discussed

Finally, in the political field,
Firestone suggested that the var-

CIGARE‘1Es::

ious disaffiliated student political
groups meet once a month and de-
bate under the Political Forum.
“Their diverse opinions should re-
sult in lively and intelligent de-
bates,” Firestone commented.

“Perhaps the results could be
read by the head of the Forum at
the next SG meeting and the Sen-
ate could vote and resolve the
problem.”

Secondly in this area, Fire-
stone suggested that seminars be
set up with the foreign students
for a “meaningful activity to
help them understand the U.S.”
as well as providing an inform;

tive discussion for University
students.

After last week’s decision to

change the SG meeting day from.

Monday to Tuesday from 3 to 5
p.m., Judy Diethorn looked up

.some statistics on the senators’

schedules and found that although
eight senators were unable to at-!
tend on _ Monday and seven on‘
Tuesday, the latter meeting day
would eliminate half of the vice-
‘presidents who were on the Sen-

ate for the first time. It was there-
fore passed that the meeting day
be changed to Thursday night
from 6:30 to 8:30 p.m.

NEWMAN ELECTIONS

Recent elections have resulted
in the appointment of Tom
Kiernan to the presidency of
next years Newman Club.

The positions of first and
second vice-presidents will be
filled by Dave Urbaitis and
Lynette Hodges respectively.
Miriam Myers was elected tras-
urer _-and Geraldine Peterson
secretary. Joanne «Janos was
named club historian.
