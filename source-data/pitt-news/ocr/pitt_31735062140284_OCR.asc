THE COURSE. IN ECONOM-
ICS AND ITS RELATION
TO THE BUSINESS MAN.

Mr. Charles D. Wettach, President of
the Evening School Association,
Vice President of W. W. Law-

In speaking to you on this subject
this evening from the point of view
of the business man, it seems to me
that the question o-f education is not
approached» from the right viewpoint.
Education simply means imparting
knowledge. Knowledge is intelligen-t
information or the perception of a
truth or fact. Intelligence, however,
A man may be
ever so well educated, but may be

A I   A Special eature

The Board of Editors takes pleasure in announcing a unique
number this week, in that the news columns have given place to ‘a se-
ries of excellent articles written by the iacultyof the School of Econom-

ICS and S€V€!'3.l businessmen.

\

a Primarily the issue is of interest to the School of Economics,
but it ‘is the opinion of the editors thatthe information should be of

‘value to every student in the University of Pittsburgh.

Next week the usual news features will be resumedlwith an

exceptionally strong number.

SCHOOL or ECONOMICS OFFERS      
A UNUSUAL ADVANTAGES T0 STUDENTS

Preparation for Business is ‘Given Impetus by Establishment of
School of Business Administration-Prepared for Social, Philan-

thropic and Civic Work.’

The School" of Economics of the,

University of Pittsburgh provides
special training for the young man .in-
tending to enter business life. It
does not lose sight of the prime ob-
ject ofiall college training—-the fur-
nishing of mental discipline and lib-
eral culture, but it supplements this
training with a thorough understand-
ing -of the underlying principles of

commerce and trade, and a special-
certain branches of

knowledge of
business, thus equipping young .men
more -fully for careers in business and
manufacturing "management, ‘banking
and ﬁnance, «accountancy, railway ad-

ministration, foreign trade and the

consular service, insurance, journal-
ism, law, etc.

In addition to the t.raining_ for busi-
ness careers, the School of Economics
provides preparation for social, phil-
anthropic and civic work. The in-
creasing activity in civic and philan-
thropic work calls for trained men
and women to assume the leadership
and direction of these movements.
Fundamental courses in politics. so-
ciology and economics are supple-’

mented with specialized courses in
citizenship, municipal government,
civic problems, munic.ipal ﬁnance, vital
statistics, social reform, labor prob-
lems, immigration, problems of the
dependent, defective and delinquent
classes, and related questions.

In conjunction with the School of
Education, special training is offered

for the teaching of the commercial

bnanches in high schools and acade-
mies. The demand for commercial
teachers with college training along
the required lines in economics, bank-
ing, business practice and law, com-
mercial geography. and history, ac-
counting, civics, sociology, etc., runs
far ahead of the supply. ’

The Evening School of Economics,
Accounts and Finance meets
needs of men. already engaged in busi-
ness or professional life who are un-
able to take a college course, yet real-
ize the advantages of further e~du_ca‘—
tion to increase their efficiency. It
also meets the need of those who de-
sire to supplement their earlier gen-
eral college training with a system-
atic study of the mechanism, organi-
zation and administration of business.

is the man with good common sense
who will, to a large extent, succeed
in business, or in fact in any pro-
fession. Business, as you all know
without explanation, is today a word
of extensive proportions. Business
has reached a. high plane for the rea-
son that it is -the business man who
must settle the great econornic prob-
lems of the day. Who is it that
builds your bridges, erects your hos-
pitals, or endows your universities

.i£l_1l(I public institutions?

Is it not the
business men—-—the amlbassadors of
commerce, the me-n who send their
wares and prod.-ucts to all parts of the
world?’ Civilization follows business,
therefore business must be the potent
power of the day. I

V‘/heni it comes to solving the prob-
lems of the day, the lawver has con-
ditions presented to him, but the
business man must meet conditions;

New lnstructor
. Comes Here

Ira. G. Flocken Comes to Uni-‘
versity to Take Up Work in,
School of Economics.

As a result of the rapid expansion
of the work in the School of Econo-

vmics, a new instructor, Mr. Ira G.

Flocken, has been added to the fac--
ulty of that school. ‘
Mr. Flocken is a graduate of Ohio

State University, where he specialized ‘ I

in ec-onomics. He took his Master of
Arts degree at Cornell, University,
where he held the fellowship in sta-
tistics and: economizcs in 1909. He
has also pursued graduate work at
Chicago University, Ohio State Uni-

versity, and the University of Illi-N

nois. This year Mr. Flocken holds

the positionvof instructor in Account- A

ing and Economics in the University
of Illinois. In «addition to broad,
thorough academic preparation, he
has had considerable business expe-
rience, and it is expected -that he will
prove a most valuable acquisition to
the ‘faculty of the School of Eco-
nomics. i V I I,
Mr. Flocken will" enter upon his
new duties in June, and will give
courses in industry, transportation,
accounting and general ecofiiomics.

 ‘EDUCATION FOR BUSINESS.

Jay‘, Dr. J. T. Holdsworth,‘ Head of

s the School of Economics.

~Until recent years the practioa-l
business man has been inclined to

scoff at a college education as a prep-
paration _ for a business career.

In
many fields of business endeavor: _the
number of men who have achieved
success without the advantages of a

college training would seem to prove

that such a training is not essential.

iButs it is often -overlooked that these

succe«ss'es_ were gained in spite of, -and
not because of, this deﬁciency. The

exceptional man will surmount ‘drif-
,_ ‘ﬁculties and reach" the top n-o matter

no reason why. the average young
man should deliberately

I these difficulties.
 L The change from the individualistic
, to the corporate form of business,

@international markets, have ‘brought

Suc-

demands a clear understanding -of the
‘complex interrelations of the indus-

trial organization, and a knowledge
of how to correlate them and to make
the machinery operate without fric-

- tion or waste.

Training in Schools.

Now, where is theyoung man who
enters business with its complex and
minute specialization, going to get an

understanding of these fundamental

rfactvs and principles? “The employer
cannot be expected to turn ‘his estab-
1ish'm‘en»t into «an educational institu-

_tion for teaching the broad and fun-

gineering schools can best give.‘
Under business conditions existing
a genenation ago, it was common for
a lad to enter/if store,‘-ofﬁce, or finan-
cial institution, and work up to a
position -of responsibility and trust,
but under the present highly special-
ized business regime this vbecomes
relatively less possible. Business is
no longer conducted ‘by ‘‘rule of
thumb” and preparation, for it is not
t-o be circumscribed by the routine
of ofﬁce work. Positions of responsi-

bility demand intelligence with ac-=

curate , and rapid thought, powers
which education can best give. The
youth who looks forward to a ca-
reer in bus.iness must. therefore, be
"trained for his life work, and the uni-
versitymust meet the demand for this
training just as it does for the other
professions.

_ Commercial Curriculum.

Opposition or indifference to uni-
versity training for bus.iness has been
due to two main causes: First, our
in-herited notions of education which
unduly emphasize the humanitarian
side; and, s-e-cond, the idea -that busi-
ness cannot be taught. It must be
admitted that many -of the studies of
the old college icurriculum had but
little apparent relation to the busi-
ness world. Even as mental discip-
line they are not superior to other
studies which have the advantage of
dealing with subjects related to every-
day life. Now, however, educators
realize the necessity of a closer con-
tact between the invstitutiqns of learn-
ing and the business world. I Com-
mercial education,’ out of the neces-
sities of the case, has forced its way
to the front, and business men «are
coming more .and more to recognize
the value of the specialized training

\

given in schools -of economics, com-..

merce, or business administration-
training which is at once cultured
and utilitarian. ‘ _ s

We have got beyond the idea that
the sole purpose of «a. 'college~cur-
riculum is to provide a liberal edu-
cation and that the student should
never stuid-y anything that would
sharpen his mind toward earning a
living. Says President Judson. of
Chicago University: “We believe in
time, we believe in training, we be-
lieve in a man sharpening his mind
by many things that -he is not going
to use, and yet. we believe that a
part of a college course may ‘consist
of things that do have a bearing on
the vocation ofva man. . . . We be-
lieve that a liberal‘ education that
trains a man to be intelligent and
that trains -his mind is not forfeited

by -putting into it some things, the
knowledge of which makes one more

intelligent and more efﬁcient in the
line of one’s—future activity in life;
and, second, that those things can
be selected and taught wisely by. spe-

=cialists, just as wisely and just as

well as Latin or Greek or French or
chemistry.” ’ '

versity; now Harvard has its suc-
cessful School\of Business Adminis-
tration. Within recent years every
leading university in the United states
has provided for instruction along
lines intended to be helpful to young
men who expect to go into business

ment has taken place. Even con-

of Illinois, sums up the result of this
development thus: “That the victory
of the well—planned, well-taught cur-
riculum of the vocational school over
the haphazard training of the office,
the farm, the shop, is becoming ever
more certain, and that especially in
all those departments of life in which

'whol-e and in a large way, is de_pend-
ent upon the development of certain
underlying fundamental sciences, by
training in whichthe young man may
get some help and assistance in prepa-
ration for his actual life work.”

Rules To Be Learned.

Busineiss success has been ‘popularly
regarded as depen~d:e‘nt upon chance,
or opportunity, or peculiar aptitude,
a sort of hocus-pocus, not governed
by fundamental rules aind”'"princi-ples,
and so beyond analysis ‘or explana-
tion.‘ “In the conversion of baser
metals into gold, which unfortunately
has been ‘too largely the rneasure set
on business success, there has been
conceived to be s-ome alchemic pro-
cess beyond the ken of those not
born with the favor of the stars.”

cine or engineering, is fro~ote(l in

Business science is. now an accom-
plished fact. Until recently the ap-

The manufacturer who introduces a

'not infer that when a youngman is

trained in college for ‘banking, ac-

pany. The student who is trained for
business life must start at the foot of
the ladder just as must the graduate
in law, engineering or medicine.
Every beginne~r.must serve an ap-
prenticeship in the lower rounds of
business, but the youth who begins
with no knowledge of business prin-
ciples is apt either to gain a costly
experience at the expense -of the con-

cern, or to be relegated ptermainently,

to routine-work. The beginner who
has had the benefit of a university
training may perform the necessary
routine -duties of his position no bet-
ter at first than the man who has had
no preliminary training; but he un-
derstands better the relation of his
routine tasks to .the entire business.

He will be able to rise more quickly
from “the position of a routine auto-
maton to that of a.n alert~anId intelli-
gent, though subordinate, factor in
the business organization, capable of
seizing opportunities for greater use-
fulness and promotion.” In a few
years, he will be much further ahead
than the man who -h-as not»h-aid: this

rather by» -the inﬂuence that one’s
business has upon himself, and the

PREPARATION FOR THE
REAL ESTATE BUSINESS.

 

Commonwealth Real Estate
Company. ~

 

To state in any concise way what
a‘ca»d‘emi.c training is essential to pre-
pare one to start into. the “real. estate
business .is I3 most difﬁcult task. It
is comparatively easy to outline a
.course of study for the young man

of medicine, or dentistry, or engineer-
ing, where the rules and order of do-
ing things are along welladeﬁned lines
and upon a concrete basis. But in‘*
the real estate busineiss—-and. to‘ a
large extent the same thing holds
true in merchandising and manufac-
turing—-—one has to deal with all

.a knowledge of human nature. Of
course, incident to this, one must
have m-o-re or lefss academic training
and knowledge along. certain lines,
only A incidents I or
threads, as it were, to be put together

by experience and application to‘ ﬁt «

one for thereal estate business.
Generally speaking, most of. the

things in the Way of academic train’-

ign which make for success in any -of

essential in preparation for the real
estate business.

But a training along -par‘ticul-ar
lines, such as is afforded» .in the

School of Econom-ics, would greatly H

help, irrespective of what one’s pre—_
vious academic training may have
been, for the training in t-he School
of Economics can be so shaped as to
di-rect the stu-d9ent’s mind to the things ,
particularly essential in any line’-off
business. 5

Mind Is Trained. . \ i

It must be recognized that the mind‘
is a great -tool by which one carves
out l.ife’s activities, and it is self-evi-
deint, therefore, that the better suc.h
mind is trained, the shairpci will be
th*e“to«ol—-and like anytool, it may be
sharp or well-trained in some places‘

other parts. It is. proper to remark,
herekthat the mind, like --the tool, even 
ifit has a ﬁne edge (full trained) ‘pro-f
duces no effect‘ or result unless it is‘
plied with energy and force; and,

the more it is swell and evenly sharp-‘Q

er and keener the edge, and the full- 
er and keener the thought. The;

bright, keen, evenly-edgevdi tool Willi '

do the highest class and Iﬁnest work,§
and the well-trained, fullv—developedi

Amind will likewise pro-d‘uce the high-<1

est nesults.
I
Experience and Application. A ,

. p ’

In the real estate business as much, 
if n-ot more thanin any other buszi-if
nsss,‘ experience and application are!

m-an nature enters» so largely here,
that no matter‘ what one’s academic
training may be, no matter how keen
or full one’s mind, it is always a great
factor. On the other hand, experience
without the proper academic training
along certain lines cannot bring as
great results in so short a time as
where this special preparation and
training has been received, unless it
be in the very exceptional case _where
one has a very full and broad anti-
tude by nature for the work.

I would suggest as some of the es-‘
sentials for the foun~dla'tion of the real
estate business the following: Apthor—
ough grounding in English, including
spelling and grammar; applied mathe-
matics, including general bookkeep-
ing; ‘history, drafting, literature and
biography; geography, especivaillv of
our own state, county and City, which
should include the progress ‘and
growth as well as natural and manu-
facturing developments; banking and
general .commercial law, incluuding
conveyancing and leasing—-—'and such
other studies a-s will aid in the knowl-
edge of application, method and thor-
oughness. . '

LIFE INSURANCE _
- AS A" PROFESSION.

i~ By Mr. Edward A. Woods, Manager

of the Equitable Life Assurance
' ‘Society.

_It is of ﬁrst importance that a vo-
cation ybe deliberately chosen, that the
young "man is not selected at random
by the first ﬁrm or business that of-
rfers him a position. The success of
«professional men is more certain
than that of men in general business;

not. entirelylbecause the hazard, of
capital is not involved, but because a

professional man deliberately selects

‘ta vocation. that he feels ﬁtted fo-r and

‘gives himself the advantage of years

' of ‘training for that work..

In selecting a vocation, considera-
tion should be given first and prin-

 cipally to something worth while, in-

tojwhich you can put your heart.

ﬂ"T’his will stimulate you to continued

endeavor many times when you would

otherwise give way to discourage-

ment. Many a clergyman, teacher,

 missionary, or ‘physician has .nerved

conviction of thegood he is accom-

fplishing than anything else.

Life _Insurance Excels.

Life insurance exceeds all other
ﬁnancial interests put together in
that it interests, in this country, more

individuals than are interested in sav- '

ings banks, the ownership of real es-
tate, and in stock of all kinds of cor-
porations, including building
loan’ associations, combined. Its ran-
id growth from less than 50,000‘po1i-

THE ADVANTAGE or
A KNOWLEDGE. OF
COMMERCIAL SPANISH.

Philip Warner Harry, Ph. D., Profes-
sor of Romance Lariguages.

Duringthe pastfew weeks a great‘

deal of interest has been centering
just on the .-other side of the Rio
Grande. It has been a question, in
the great game of politics, whether
Uncle Samjis going to send his sol-
diers across the river or not. On
the other side lies a country of un-
told resources, a country that has al-
ready been invaded, not ‘by an armed
force, but by American commerce. An
army of American capitalists and em-
ployees, representing American busi-
ness ﬁrms, is now in Mexico and
South America. and more are sure to
follow. It is being recognized every-
where that there is a great ﬁeld for
American brains and American capi-
tal, especially after all fear of insur-
rectos has ceased. I

M-exico particular-ly has been at-
tracting American capital. Today

:there are over 6,000 Americans in the

City of Mexico, the majority of

;whom are in the employ o-f railroads

jnish some income from the start, it I;

 

and mining companies, or who repre-
sent American business houses. Nat-
urally, the Mexicans resent the Amer-
ican invasion, but secretly they ad-
mire us. The Americano they call
gringo, and thereby h.angs a tale.
Suffice it to say that gringo seems
to be a corruption of the English
words _‘_‘g~reen grow,” in the verse,
“Green grow the rushes, O.”
Mexicans admire the business-like
methods‘ of the American‘. They ad-
mire his self-reliance, his nerve, ‘his
promiptitude. Manana (tomorrow) is
9. word that is not used so common-

promotes thrift,_

take it,l»to contact with Americans,
and the recognition and appreciation
of American business methods.

Commerce Follows the Flag.

It is a truism, I imagine,that com-
merce follows the flag. . But why Walt
for the ﬂag?
guage. the language of the country, I

mean, should go hand in hand. We A

should follow Germany’s lead here.
That great commercial country sends
out from its business houses and com-
mercial schools men who are acquaint-
ed with the language of the country
in which they are interested. It is
clearly evident what a great advan-
tage this means in buying and selling
in foreign territory. Every commer-
cial traveler knows the advantage of
being able to tell a joke in the ver-
nacular. _

Our business relations with Mexico,
Cuba, Porto Rico and‘South America
are expanding so rapidly that busi-
ness men are beginning to see that
it is of the greatest importance, if not
absolutely necessarv. to -have in ‘théil’
employ men who can take care of the
Spanish correspondence. I am ac-
quainted with a doze-n business men,

more or less, who have found it to A
. their

advantage to acquire some

Spanish. They do not find it con-

venient or economic to send, a letter"

to the Berlitz School "of Languages

heard of a young man who *became
connected with a business house in

New York city that had relations with.

South America. He saw quickly that

it would be a good’ thing to learn ,

Spanish. He did so. Today he re-
gards his knowledge of Spanish as
one of the chief factors in his secur-
ing a $10,000 position. '

Need For English.

Business men should. bear in mind

that English is not a universal lan—'

guage. French, rather than our
tongue, is being taught in‘ the schools

of Mexico. ’We cannot force English '

down our neighbor’s throat.

A young man just out of college,
or more particularly a young man
who has followed a technical course
_in engineering,‘not knowing towhat
part of the world he will drift, obtains
a good position, in Mexico, for exam-

If you put a busi-ness proposition

COMMERCIAL GERMAN. , '

 

Ferdinand Berger, A. M., Professor
of the German Language and
» Literature. ‘
Acquiring an appreciation for the
literature of a people whose lyric
‘poetry is unequaled and whose great-
est writer is surpassed only by
Shakespeare, Homer and Dante, is
certainly a‘ means of reﬁnement.
However, we must not overlook the

fact that we are living in an essen-

tially commercial age where‘ material
interests are predominant. Even Ger-
many, the land of the poets, the think-
ers, the idealists, recognizes this fact.
Her marvelous commercial success
pr-oves to the world that a nation.

-which is best equipped: with the lan-

guages of the respective countries
with which it is "desirous to estab-
lish advantageous commercial, rela-
tions, is the nation that gets the busi-
ness,‘and the language is the means
to that end. And in this sense, Ger-
many is the land with which we -have
to reckon. Hence, the importance of
commercial German, not the lofty, a*b-.
stract language found in Lessing’s,

.Goethe’s an-cl. Schiller"s masterworks,

but the ‘simple practical language of

' daily life.

German Is Practical.

When Germany within recent. years
founded a commercial university at

*-Cologne, from which she sends an-

nually at her own expense from «for-
ty to ﬁfty s.tucl‘e»nts along with sev-
eral professors to visit various coun-
tries for the purpose of study and

practice, she appreciates the impor-'

tance of commercial training. We re-
call such a visit in the United: States
last summer. Germany |ClaOeS no-t cal-
culate so much upon immediate bene-
ﬁts, but upon future "results which

-will compensate a hundred fold for.

the expense.
It is only recently that the schools

and colleges of the United States have

realized -the importance of the study
of a language in its commercial
aspecst. Opportunities for young men
leaving -college, well equipped with
commercial German, practically un-
knownnot so many years ago, are
open to them now, such as consulates
in the numerous cities in Germany
and its dependencies.
In Manufacturing.

Since it is an undisputed fact thait

(Germany leads in science, we I 'emand

from our chemical and electrical en;
gineers who supe-rintend the construc-
tion of ‘powder mills, acid factories,
etc._, a comprehensive knowledge of

,the German". language.

In the New England manufacturing
towns, especially those in Massachu-
setts, the great part of the work in
the mills is done by Germans. .That
these ‘people may make -this count-ry
their -own and ‘be helped out of ~dxifﬁ—
culties, it is necessary for the banks,
real estate‘ ofﬁces, steamship compa-
nies, etc., to employ young men, who

- are able to help these immigrants in
.choosing their. homes, in investing

"Eheir savings, and in becoming loyal
ci-tizens; otherwise they will live to-
gether in communities, using their

own language and adhering to the

 

customs of their Fatherland. It is
here that the loyal American will

strive to become familiarwwith the

German language and do his utmost
to keep up our -reputation with Ger-
many and other European countries.

VALUE OF PUBLIC SPEAK-
ING TO BUSINESS MEN.

Arthur  Fish, A. B., Instructor in
Public Speaking.

There are just ﬁve reasons that
we wish brieﬂy and imperfectly to
present why public speaking———as we
try to teach it——should constitute an
important part of a Business man’s
training:

Business men are coming universal-
ly to recognize its value. We never
talk to a business man who does not
either congratulate himself ov-er what
training he has had: or regret that
he has had none. Schools of sales-
mansip are important evidence of this
recognition.’ These schools do, in a
narrowly specialized way, what we
do in a deep _and broad: way. Con-
sider, also, Funk—Wagnalls Company’s
advertisement in the leading papers:
“To Teach Public Speaking by Mail.”
That.it is manifestly impossible to
properly teach the subject by mail
does not disprove the fact that there
is a general demand among business
and professional men for the train-
ing. Advertisements aim to ‘hit a
demand. '

Clinches the Bargain. V

Public speaking cultivates the vo-ice
and general power of address. It
aims to develop that power of ad-
dress, to the few or to the many,
“That clinches the bargain, sails out
of the bay; gets «the vote in the Sen-
ate, spite of Webster or Clay.” Few
realize that there are deep principles
to learn and apply, whether the prob-
lem is to address the many or the
few; and that these principles are to
be learned. v

It zairns to teach a knowledge of
men. How? By giving‘ a knowledge
of the principles of persuasion; of the
things that move men, through their
intellect and feelings, to act.

It aims to develop the power of

expression. No other course,’ any-
where, does -this as does public
speaking. Business today "is done

rapidly. It requires‘ quick th-ough-t,
ready speech. It ‘requires ability to
go to the heart of a matter and then
say it: to customer, employes or busi-
ness associate. Public Speaking teach-
es this ready. and pointed: expression.
sThis point sh-ows most clearly the

‘vital relation between business and

public speaking. Selling, of course, is
the heart of business. Well, selling is
getting an order. Public Speaking is
getting a‘ verdict. Both seek to per-
suade men to act as you want them
to act. The three processes involved
in selling an article -are precisely the
steps in a successful public speech: _

(a) Attracting attention to the
precise nature of the -article.

Cb.) Creating a demand for it.

(C) “Clinching the order.” H

I need not emphasize the vast im-

portance of teaching young business

(

.social injustice will only disappear

men, not only these three steps, but
the psychology, the logic, the scien-
tiﬁc principles, that underlie them.
In short, public speaking aims~—and
succeeds where the student, does his
part——in teaching, in a broad-and
scientiﬁc way, those principles which
underlie a business man’s task, and
which he must daily apply either in
a haphazard. uncertain manner, or with
practiced, scientiﬁc certaintv.

BUSINESS. ETHICS.

By Dr. S. B. Linhart, Secretary of
I the University.

While there are great economic
problems which are unsettled and
which are receiving a great deal of
attention, it must be remembered that
these problems, while economic, have
also an et'hical aspect. In fact they
are fundamentally ethical. The im-
portant question today ‘is not alto-
gether one of -efficiency in production
but whether the brenle:ﬁts arising from
efficiency in production, are equally
distributed;—whether both capital on

the one hand and labor on the other T

receive a fair share of the results of
their efforts.

To be sure We are intensely inter-
ested today in efficiency in produc-
tion. Waste and inefficilerncy involve
loss to ‘all. Efficient business man-
agement is dem-a'n«dIed in every in-

dustry. There is an ever increasing‘

derntand for trained men in banks,
newspaper offideus, manufacturing es-
tablishments, and every other depart-
ment of commercial life. The busi-
ness man recogniizes as never before
the value ofthle college man in «busi-
ness, but mere brilliancy of intellect
or skill in handling affairs without
high moral ideals will’ not meet the
need ,of this age. The social injus-
tice which cries out for reform has
been brought about by the ignoring
of ethical standards by those who_
have enjoye-d great opportunities but
who have used them selﬁshly. This

when those who occupy positions of
inﬂuence and power base their con-
duct on right moral principles. We
must consider in this matter not only
the quantity of production, but also
its moral costantd. the relation of
property to character. I

Character is , Requisite.

Because of these conditions, in our
school-of economics w.e imust empha-
size training in character as well as
training in efficiency. Great" oppor-
tunities are sure to be o-pen for those
who are trained in-telle-ctually and
technically for positions of responsi-
bility in commercial life, but the true
success of these men depends on their
ability to ‘distinguish right from
wrong, [and upon their willingness to
dedicate themselves to the service of
their fellow men. Selﬁsh individual-
ism must give way to -the determina-
tion to deal justly with all, and while
seeking individual success that altru-
istic spirrit must be cultivated which
is unwilling that even the humblest
worker shall be deprived of any part
of his right to life, liberty and the
pursuit of happiness, and also to «a.

  

fair share of the rewards of his in-

dustry'. ' _‘ V i

Prof. Frost »expressed some sur-i

prise when called upon, no pnevvious’
warning having been given him, but‘
gave a short impromptu talk mainly!
growing out of, or naither suggested.
by, the remarks of the speakers who!
preceded him. He said in substance
and in part: _

As I ‘h-avlev been listening with great
interest to the speakers who lhave
thus far addressed you, mostly, I may
say from my standpoint of years of
service, your young instructors-, I
have been asking myself what‘ is to be.
the effect of most worth, of their
work and daily association with you
as students.

Are you going ‘out simply with‘

well-ﬁll-‘ed note-books of admirably
digested fac-ts, v.al'uable as this equip-
ment will be, or are you, on the
other hand, to carry with this fund of
iiif-ormation the inspiration that
should come, not -ailqne from the con-
viction you must have of the thor-
of their knowledge, but
from that intangible something other
than their words, w*-hic‘h in them indi-
cates high moral purpose and breadth
of view concerning the real founda-
tions of ‘character. and intellectual
power.

This I most earnestly ask you to
consider, and so to «act, with regard
so
constantly to you, that the

SOCIAL SERVICE AND THE
SCHOOL OF ECONOMICS.

Rufus D. Smith, A. B., Instructor in
Sociology.
The

ideal of social service, as a

profession ranking with law, medi-

cine an-d the ministry .is now recog-
nized! by all. The growth of our
great u.rban districts with their many
complicated problems deman-dis minds
trained in the social sciences. T-he
old-time doctor with his general prac-
tice and: poor training has given way
to the Specialist, to the laboratory,
to the sanitary engineer, to the man
with a rigorous training. In a great

many ways the methods of old-time‘

me-dicine are analogous to the meth-

ods and ideals of many social work—'

ers. Only a decade ago, and even

now. in many cir-cies, the idea is held,

that to be a siiccessful worker in so-
cial problems one only has to have a

‘ large fund of sympathy and a de-

and with the tramp without knowing
about labor problems‘; crises, employ-
ment agencies. workingman’s insur-
ance, casual labor and many other
parts of our industrial life? In char-
ita‘ble work, the unit of actio-n is the
family. Around the family-we have

many lines of study needed: by the;

successful worker. He should have 2,

clear, idea of the economic effect of»

sickness, divorce, desertion and n-on-
support, standards of livinw and the
history of the family. For the work-
er in criminology, many of these stu-
dies and more are needed if one ex-
pectsf to be a broad-gauged, well-
trained and capable leader.
Need the Training.‘

Those who shape and direct pub-
lic opinion and who are inspired -to
zeal by philanthropic and social mo-
tives, need the sociological outlook
upon complicatelde - problems. The
merely “practic-al worker” who affects
to «despise history and theory be-
comes obstinate, inﬂexible, and a slave
of his own little past, while the stu-

dent is more apt to be fresh. invent-’

ive and open to new ideas. The
p1‘aJC'ClCal worker who acts without
principles and who never dis-covers

‘any general Laws. remains a hope-

less ﬂoater all his life. All the real
leaders in the ﬁeld of social work
are men and women of mental power
and comprehension. One only has to
name leaders such as Jane Addams,
Edward T. Divine, Jacob Riis and
many others to show this.

Today this‘ ﬁelid is attracting the
best men and_women of our colleges
and universities. Four schools of
philanthropy working in close con-
nection with four of our largest uni-
versities have been started in order

to meet the increasing demand for
At present this de-
mand is much greater than the sup-
ply. Social settlements. charity or-

sions, 'children’s work, welfare work’

ity are eagerly looking for leaders.
