When Pitt police pulled over Halid Mardini
for running a red light on his way to class,
they asked him if he was insane. A

“No,” Mardini said. He was late for
class and really needed to cross. Mardini
told the oﬂicer he thought it was OK to
go through the light if he was in a hurry.

Mardini, a junior from Turkey major-
ing in psychology and economics, said the
biggest adjustment he made when he came
to the United States was learning that he
had to obey the law.

“They don’t really do that in Istanbul,”
Mardini said.

Mardini and six other international stu-
dents spoke to roughly 100 people about
their stories of culture shock and read-
justment at the Socialjustice Symposium
hosted by Pitt’s Ofﬁce of Student Affairs at
9 a.m. on Thursday in the University Club.

Oyeronke Oyebode, a junior from Ni-
geria majoring in health sciences, said she
told everyone to call her “Ronnie” when
she ﬁrst came to Pitt because its pronun-
ciation was easier than that of her real

Panther Autism Awareness Group strives to"
gain recognition from national organization

Joelle Smith

Kristen Mowery, the founder of the Pan-
ther Autism Awareness Group, grew up
with an autistic younger brother and
witnessed his challenges each day. This
experience influenced her during her
time at Pitt, prompting her to reach out
to those who know someone affected by
the disorder.

“I know a lot of people on Pitt’s cam-

pus also may have autism, and they have
the same struggles that my brother has
gone through,” Mowery, a psychology
major who graduated last semester, said.
“I really just wanted to start a group on
campus that would allow our student
body to advocate for those people.”

Since its creation in 2012, The Pan-
ther Autism Awareness Group has un-
dertaken a mission to expand its reach
beyond campus.

According to the Centers for Disease

  

Control and Prevention, autism affects
one in 88 children in America. As the
autism awareness movement is still in
its infancy, Mowery knew the Pitt com-
munity needed to get involved. Mowery
launched The Panther Autism Aware-
ness Group in spring 2012 with about
10 members, a number that has since
grown to 15. With a goal of promoting
autism awareness, Pitt’s group is vying

for recognition as an official chapter

from Autism Speaks U, a national autism ’

science and advocacy organization.

‘ A student chapter must acquire at
least 25 members, secure a faculty advi-
sor and develop a plan of goals to become
an official Autism Speaks U chapter to
represent the national organization’s
cause. Other requirements include the
hosting of a general interest meeting

and a commitment to a fundraising goal ‘

of between $1,500 and $3,000 for its
first semester.
Acéording to Heidi Pappert, the Pitt

group’s president—elect and a junior
majoring in’spe_ech language pathol-
ogy, Pitt’s chapter needs about 10 new
members to_ become recognized by the

» Pittsburgh chapter of Autism Speaks.

The group also needs to raise about
$2000 and submit campaign ideas to
Autism Speaks for their group. This se-
mester, the group meets once a month
on Wednesdays.

As oflast month, roughly 60’univer_-T
sities ae_hieved,ofﬁcial Autism Speaks U
chapter status. Nine of these chapters
are based at Pennsylyania universities,

lvincluding Indiana. University of Penn—‘

sylvania, Slippery Rock University, Get-
tysburg College, St. Joseph’s University
and West Chester University.

The Panther Autism Awareness Group
has been pushing to join these other
universities in official chapter status.

The group’s campaigns have included
inviting staff members from Pitt’s School
of Education to ‘speak about the disor-
der around campus. In addition, group
members managed tables in Litchﬁeld
Towers, created T—shirts and distributed
flyers to promote, the group. H

The group also’ elected an eicecutive

board during its first year, and Mow-T

ery said she’s thrilled with the group’s
progress.

“I think they’ve done awesome things
with the [group] . Things I wouldn’t have
even thought to do, myself.”

Ben Weiner, the group’s secretary and

 

a sophomore neuroscience major, said
he believes recognition from Autism
Speaks will validate the group’s role
within the community.

Weiner said acknowledgment from
Autism Speaks would publicize the or-
ganization, bring more legitimacy to the

group and provide funding and further

opportunities for guest speakers.

With a mission in mind, Pappert is
looking to rally more members and fun-
draise for Autism Speaks. ' ’

Pappert hopes to achieve these goals
at acarnival in April, through which the
Panther Autism Awareness Group would
donate the proceeds to Autism Speaks.

name. But years later, she realized it was
an “insult to her culture” to let people call
her by an Americanized name. i
“Your parents name you for a speciﬁc
reason,” Oyebode said. “If you were born
on a Sunday, they might name you Sunday.
My name is Oyeronke. You’re just kind of
expected to take on the American culture.”
Professor Ruldie Altamirano, the key-
note speaker and director of International
Student and Scholar Services at the Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania, said he experi-

when he came to the United States from

Altamirano recounted a story of "an
acquaintance who offered him a ride to
the airport as he walked in the cold years
ago. He declined the offer, waiting for the
acquaintance to offer again, as is custom-
ary in the Philippines. The driver didn’t
and drove away.

At the University of Pennsylvania,
Altamirano’s goal is to offer “holistic at-
tention and multicultural empathy” for
international students. T

Pitt’s Office of Cross-,Cultural and Leaﬁd-.3
ership Development is trying to imple-
ment some of Altamirano’s suggestions I

which international undergraduates can
meet to ease the- transition of moving to
a foreign country.

Gita Maharaj a, an academic advisor at‘

Duquesne University, spoke about her ex-
periences advising undergraduate inter-
national students and the challenges she
dealt with when she came to the United
States.

“The concept of an "appointment takes
a long time to come [to international stu-
dents] ,” Maharaj a said. “How are you go-
ing to say, ‘You don’t have an appointment,
please walk out of my oflice?’”

Many international students at
Duquesne hail from Middle Eastern or

give gifts as a way of saying thank you for
kindness, Maharaja said. But the gesture
can create problems for American pro-

. fessors. She advises that students not be

offended if someone doesn’t accept their
gifts, because American culture attaches
different connotations with gift-giving.
“Of course, I accept all gifts,” she said.
“My office is full of gifts.’~’

Maharaj a teaches a seven-week course
at Duquesne that gives international stu-
dents a space to ask for help adjusting
to American culture or address prob-
lems they’ve had with campus life so far.

enced many instances of culture shock in programs such as Global Ties, through Asian nations, where it is customary to CU [W V9 D 4

in molecular biology, enjoys participat-

initiatives.

Inspired by a cousin with autism,
Corbo began helping his aunt, who is

works privately, Corbo joined her on trips

', to patient’s homes.

“It was probably the most difficult
andrewarding thing l’ve ever
done. it was really, really cool.”

The carnival will also provide stu-
dents, Weiner said‘, with the opportunity

to have a glimpse at what at life with au---

tism is like.

‘ “We’re hoping to have a sensory’ table
for kids and students to feel what its like
to live a day with autism,” he said.‘

Last fall,-the group hosted the Autism
Awareness Ball-for a night of dancing
on Saturday, Nov. 9, 2013 at the O’Hara
Student Center, but Weinersaid atten-
dance was stunted because the ball was

scheduled on the same day as the Pitt vs.

Notre Dame football game. f

A bake sale, which would advertise
the group and raise funds for its pursuits,
is also on the group’s agenda.

Pappert said the group also plans to
participate in and potentially volunteer
at the Autism Walk for Autism Speaks
in Pittsburgh this June at Heinz Field.

language barriers still persist between
students and professors.

“Allyou need is one student to raise
it, and everybody will agree,” she said,
referring to students’ worries that their
professors cannot understand them.

Duquesne also holds “conversation
hours” between U.S. students and inter-

national students every Friday afternoon,
Maharaja said. During these encounters,
U.S. students can ask questions about dif-
ferent countries, and the international
students can share stories about their
native cultures.

The symposium closed with the panel

swering questionsjfrom the audience.

Weiqi Li, a senior from China, said if
he could relive his time at Pitt, he’d try a
little harder to make friends earlier on. Li
said his academic experience at Pitt was

much different than in China.

“In China, you’re not supposed to
question the professor, because he’s the
authority in the classroom,” Li said. “But
here its completely different.”

Some of Pitt’s architecture also inﬂu-
enced his choice to enroll at the Univer-
sity. -

Atheists: Separate Catholic Church’s good

Works from religion, learn tolerance

Simon Brown
Columnist

Jorge Bergoglio enjoys several
unique titles: Pope Francis 1, Bish-
op of Rome, Supreme Pontiff of
the Universal Church, the Vicar of
Jesus Christ — in descending order
of divinity. And this past year, he
edged out Miley Cyrus to add Time
Magazine’s “Person of the Year” to
his long list of titles.

The ascent of Pope Francis as
the spiritual leader of more than
a billion Catholics worldwide has
been met with a renewed public
interest in the statements and ac-
tions of the pontiﬁcate. The thought
thatapapal Twitter feed would even
exist, let alone achieve more than 3
million followers, was not possible
before Pope Francis. But after‘ his
pointed criticisms of the “idolatry
of money,” his considerate discus-

. sion of gay clergymen and his em-

bodiment of a generous life, this
fourth—century oflice has received
a 21st—century following.

For many of the papal Twitter
followers, however, Francis repre-
sents the ﬁrst relevant and respon-
sive religious ﬁgure in memory.

Ours is a generation that has
ﬁrst turned away from a religious
identity en masse. How, then, do
those of us who actively reject an
organized religion respond to a man
who claims to control the spiritual
fate of all people on earth, but who
washes the feet of the poor while
doing it?

To an atheist like myself, Pope
Francis presents something of a
challenge. Throughout most of my
upbringing, my fellow non—believers
and I could write off the Catholic
Church as just one more morally
bankrupt bastion of medieval so-
cial values. I can’t say for sure what
turned me away from belief, but the

loud opposition to gay sexuality and
women’s rights comingfrom Rome
— and the silence toward the needs
of the poor —— certainly encouraged
my fall from faith.

I, like the vast majority of the
non—religiously—afﬁliated, have no
interest in “ﬁnding” a religious in-
stitution. Still, the thought of a reli-
gious leader not only speakingwith
urgency against inequitable eco-
nomic policies in away no politician
would dare, but actively reforming
the church to counter them, gives
me pause. Can I consent that this
medieval institution can be a mor-
ally relevant force in the world?

In short, can an institution
founded on what I believe to be a
myth still prove a fundamentally
positive force? To answer that ques-
tion, my fellow atheists and I will

have to seriously examine our belief system,
or lack thereof.

I ﬁrst greeted this pope-mania with skep-
ticism. An ofﬁce so steeped in mythology and
a history of repression could not improve, no
matter who wears the robes. i

That skepticism toward any'religious
legitimacy was instilled in me early in my
atheist upbringing. It is the hallmark of the
atheist tendency that has received consider-
able attention over the past decade, namely
the “New Atheism” espoused by biologist
Richard Dawkins. Not only does it reject any
supematural claims, but it denigrates all reli-
gious belief as nonsensical, even dangerous.
The false claims of all religions condemn
them to moral irrelevance they say.

 

 

   

January 2-4, 2014 I The Pitt News l \AA/vvv.pltinevvs.com

Though the ideas of Dawkins and his col-
leagues may have helped many of us accept
our own lack of belief, it is time to articulate
a more sophisticated and tolerant atheist

identity —— one thatwill allow us to praise the '

good works of Pope Francis and his slowly
modernizing Catholic Church without ac-
cepting it as the “body of Christ” on earth.
The atheist identity is fundamentally dif-
ferent from any religious one. While a reli-

gious identity comes with both a set ofbeliefs *5 b

about God and a set of ethical principles,
atheism supplies only the former, speciﬁ-
cally that there are no gods except the ones
created by humans. 5 ’

While we, as atheists, won’t subscribe to

the holy gospels, nothing should keep us from jx

admiring the social_ gospel.

The militant atheist might object here, .

however, that the social works and the reli-
gious belief of e church necessarily er

 

Sure'it’s great that the Catholic Church sup-
plies health care through its 26 percent share
of all medical providers in the world, but
that has nothing to do with its dogma. Any
charitable organization can do that without
the story of God’s creation and Christ’s cru-
ciﬁxion, they’d say. V
But for some believers, it requires the
sense of faith, the parables of moifality and '
the beliefin an afterlife to perromiiects that
many of us immediately recognize  admira-
ble. For most of the religious world, churches

'pr'ovide~~the most accessiblesocial services

and most ofthe ethical guidance. b
While atheists in the secular world might

I see a clear distinction, between someones
t_f‘religious life” on Sunday and everything _

else the rest of the week, such a difference

 does not exist for those whoseonly access
. to a moral. education comes from thepulpit. '

While college-educated atheists can claim

  

a moral life without scripture, that’s not so
easy for a student in the slums of Sao Paulo or
Mexico City whose only access to education
and medical care comes from the church.
We atheists, then, ought not become a
missionary non-religion. We ought not re-
sist the possibility that more will turn to the
Catholic Mass — a trend deemed the “Pope
Francis Effec ” -5 when they do so out of
a commendable: concern for social justice.
By accepting those actions of the church,

we gain more credibility when we decry its

contradictions, such as the forbiddance of
the ordination of femalep'riest’s."  i ‘

’ shooting underhand. Although she
kept making baskets, something had

I to change. _

As a freshman point guard on Pitt’s
women’s basketball team, Kiesel aver-
aged 13.6 points per game. One year
later, she improved that mark to 14.9,
showing a modest improvement in
her game. But for her to become one
of the premier point guards in the
Atlantic Coast Conference, she knew
something would have to change and
her game would need ﬁne—tuning.

While not as important of a change
as learning to properly shoot the bas-

7 { ketball, the tutelage_of head coach

Suzie McConnell—Serio has had a pow-
‘ . erful effect on Kiesel, a junior who
has emerged as one of the leading
scorers in the ACC, and has posted
double-figure points in all 19 games
this season.

A special talent

Kiesel’s father often took her on
trips to the park, where she made that
first underhand basket. They held

trial city an hour east of Syracuse,

Point guard pipeline: Kiesel flourishing under seasoned coach

N.Y., with a population of roughly
62,000.

Kiesel began her athletic career
at a young age, but not on the hard
court. ,

“I was a soccer player before I be-
gan playing basketball,” Kiesel said.
“I didn’t start playing [basketball]

,until I was about 10.”

She began playing varsity in eighth
grade and broke school records in
points, assists and steals at Thomas
R. Proctor High School while guiding
the girl’s team to its ﬁrst-ever Section
III championship game appearance.

It was some time during those high
school years that McConnell-Serio,
then the head coach at Duquesne Uni-
versity, just a short trip down Fifth
Avenue from Pitt, noticed Kiesel’s
special talent.

“I remember watching her in high
school, and she was so good,” McCo-
nnell—Serio said. “She is a big-time
player. I fell in love with her watching

‘ her play and I love her game. When

you go and watch games in the sum-
mertime and with [Amateur Athletic
Union basketball], you can tell there
is something special about what she
brings to a team.”

McConnell-Serio said she reached
out to Kiesel in an attempt to con-
vince her to enroll at Pitt’s crosstown
rival, Duquesne, a member of the At-

Mews BASKETBALL

Panthers aim to repeat success in rematch against Maryland

Nate Barnes
Sports Editor

When the Pitt men’s basketball team squared
offwith Marylandjan. 6, the Panthers came
away with a 20-point win at the Petersen
Events Center. Saturday, the scenery shifts
to the Comcast Center in College Park, Md.,
where the Terrapins look for redemption.

In the ﬁrst matchup between No. 20 Pitt
(17—2, 5-1 ACC) and Maryland (11—8, 3-3 ACC),
the Panthers didn’t pull away until the second
half. After 20 minutes of play, Pitt led by
just six points because Maryland success-
fully used players such as Evan Smotrycz
andjake Layman to stretch the defense from
the power forward position. A

Pitt head coach Jamie Dixon adjusted

by moving redshirt senior forward Lamar

Patterson to guard the four position and by '

playing a guard—heavy lineup. Entering Sat-
urday’s game, limiting Maryland’s shooting
is again a priority for the Panthers.

“We kept drilling, talking, reinforcing
that they’re going to shoot it from three,

‘ guarded and unguarded,” Dixon said. “The

thing we talked about was them shooting

threes and some of our guys being surprised
by their bigger guys.”

Since the two teams played, the Terrapins
have won just one game, a74-66 win at home
against Notre Dame.

Similar to when the two teams met the
ﬁrst time, Dez Wells continues to lead Mary-

land in scoring at 14.3 points per game and is
one of ﬁve players averaging double-digits.
Nick Faust and Seth Allen, each averaging
just more than 10 points a game, pair with
Wells in the backcourt.

Layman is scoring more than 12 points
per game, while Smotrycz is at 11.7 next to
his 6.8 rebounds per game. The pair of ver-
satile forwards left a lasting impression on
Pitt redshirtjunior guard_Cameron Wright.

“I thought they shot the ball pretty well,”
Wright said. “Their stretch-fours really
stretched out and handled the ball pretty

well, so that’s something that we’re really
preparing for.”

Allen led the Terrapins in scoring when‘
they last played Pitt, putting up 18 points
off the bench. Allen has played seven games
since his return from injury and is back in
the starting lineup. ‘

“We think he’s a guy that can do both
things,” Dixon said. “He’s a distributor, but
I think he’s a guy that can really get it going,
too, at the same time.”

lantic—10 conference, but the star guard
said she was set on playing big-time bas-
ketball in either the Big East — Pitt’s
former conference — or the Big Ten.

“When you see a player of her caliber,
it,doesn’t hurt to reach out and see if they
would have any interest,Abecause you just
never know,” McConnell—Serio said. “It
is ironic. The ﬁrst day I was hired [at
Pitt], I talked to her about when we tried
to recruit her when I was at Duquesne.
I told her she didn’t give us the time of
day and she laughed.”

Kiesel recalled receiving a few letters
from McConnell-Serio, but the two still
laugh, recollecting
that at the time,

 

big part of our family growing up. I was
learning from my brothers, playing in
our backyard. Thatis how I got my start.”

Playing with her brothers might have
been the experience that seasoned Mc-
Connell—Serio before her first taste of
organized basketball. She was forced
to play on a boys’ teamin fourth grade
at her small Catholic grade school in
Pittsburgh because they did not yet have
a girls’ program.

. ?‘I was a little tomboy,” she said. “I
would mostly just tag along with my
brothers to their practices. The coach
asked my parents and me if I’d be inter-
ested in playing on the boys’ team. Obvi-
ously, they were reluctant at ﬁrst to let
me do that, but for two years I played on
the boys’ team. Then we started a girls’

program.”

Kiesel struggled
to even pronounce
the name of the
school the letters
were coming from.

“First of all, I
didn’t know how
to pronounce
Duquesne,” Kie-
sel said, laughing.
“I was so young. I
looked at the let-

‘‘I’m trying to pick
her brain every
game. Coach is
a role model,

especially for me.”
Brianna Kiesel

During those
two years on the
boys’ team, McCo-
nnell—Serio said
herfirst basketball
coach, Dan Kail,
taught her some of
the lessons she still
stresses today, es-
pecially to her star
point guard.

“He coached
all of the McCon-

ters, but I never re-
ally considered it.”

‘A little tomboy’

The story of McConnell-Serio picking
up the game of basketball, a former point
guard in her own right, is a bit different
from K-iesel’s path.

As one of eight children, McConnell-
Serio had plenty of time to hone her
skills in a competitive family.

Her brother Tom played two seasons
at Davidson College and has been coach-
ing at the collegiate level since 1992.
Tim, another of her brothers, played at
Waynesburg and coaches at Chartiers
Valley High School. Her sister Kathy,
who played in four NCAA Champion-
ship games with Virginia, coached for
the WNBA’s Tulsa Shock and worked at
Pitt as a recruiting coordinator in 1991.
Maureen, yet another of the McConnell
children, played at Pitt starting in the
late ’8os.

“We were constantly playing sports,”
McConnell-Serio said. “Basketball was a

nells —— there were
_ eight of us. He em-
phasized fundamentals. As a coach, that
is something that has been a part of me
since I started playing,” she said.

The importance of fundamentals is
one that Kail says he still emphasizes to

' his young players today, but the control

McConnell-Serio demonstrated on the
court from a young age is something he
said he has not seen in almost any other
athlete he’s coached.

“She always had that court presence,”
Kail said. “At a young age, she was coach-
ing the team on the court even as a young
girl. She always played with a fire. All the
McConnell kids had a desire to win and
always understood the game very well.”

Kail pointed to one instance some-
time after he coached McConnell-Serio at
Our Lady of Loreto School in Brookline,
Pa., that she showed her resolve.

In the 1984 girls’ state champion-
ship game, McConnell-Serio led Seton-

LaSalle, but the team found themselves
down 15 points in the fourth quarter.
The Rebels’ comeback effort began in a
rather thrilling fashion," with bucket after
bucket trimming the deﬁcit. McConnell-
Serio, a senior playing in her ﬁnal high
school game, looked like she was going

"to cap an illustrious high school career

with a storybook ending.

As the clock wound down, McConnell-
Serio and Seton-LaSalle still trailed. The
senior guard went in a for a steal attempt,
but quickly pulled back knowing she had
already picked up four fouls and one
more would disqualify her.

The referee’s whistle blew. McConnell-
Serio had just fouled out on a call the
referee would later apologize for, admit-
ting that he made a mistake.

“It was the biggest game of her life
to date, but she did not complain,” Kail
said. “She walked off the court. No tears,
no emotion — took a towel and cheered
on herteammates.”

McConnell-Serio’s strong will paid off.
Her replacement hit the game—winning
shot in the final seconds to capture the
state crown.

“It wasn’t about her,” Kail said. “She
knew if she showed weakness, the team
would be finished. That moment really
was an indication of the control she had.
It took a lot of character.”

Room to grow

Kiesel wasted no time helpingthe Pan-
thers get off to a hot start in 2014, earn-
ing the U.S. Basketball Writer’s Associa-
tion’s National Player of the Week honors
and ACC Player of the Week honors for
Jan. 1-7. The award came on the heels of
Pitt’s ﬁrst conference win in almost three
years, something the team and its coach
talk about as an important building block
for the program moving forward.

For Kiesel — often in past years called
the “coach on the court” — the experi-
ence at the position that her new bench
boss brought has been instrumental in

' elevating her game.

“She knows everything,” Kiesel said of
McConnell—Serio. “I’m trying to pick her
brain every game. Coach is a role model,
especially for me.”

In terms of McConnell-Serio, it is an
ongoing process of delivering the skills

she has learned over the years from Kail
and a host of other coaches to take the
game of the Utica product to her high-
est level yet.

“The things I do with her to try to
be successful — she is so quick, she is
great off the dribble, being able to at-
tack the basket,” McConnell—Serio said.
“The one thing she is getting more com-
fortable with is being able to shoot the
thfee—point shot. She is not just one-
dimensional. She is a playmaker now.

“Our goal is for her to be the complete
point guard,” McConnell-Serio said. I
