Athletes’
’rQPAs
Above
Average

By NANCY POPKIN

The average QPA of Pitt athletes
is a 2.5. This is higher than the
national average for college athletes.
And, 80 percent of last year’s senior
football players finishing their
undergraduate requirements this
semester are expected to graduate, it

was announced yesterday at. the .

Board of Trustees meeting. ,

The Student Affairs Committee
of the board reported that students
are satisfied with resident hall life,
according to a report /delivered to

them by J.oanne..,ilitoodson at a.

luncheon meeting yesterday, ..To
complement the newalcohol policy,
an alcohol education ‘among stu-
dents and to help spot alcoholism in
its early stages.

The committee suggested raising
the student activitiesfee for gradu-
ate students from two dollars a
semester.for full-time students and
one dollar for part-time students.

~ With the extra money,-they would
develop programs to benefit these
students.

The chancellor reported that this
year’s freshmen enrollment is up 4
percent from last year. And, scholas-
lastically, it is the best freshmen class

the university has ever had. One-.

third of the class scored 600 or better
on either or both the verbal and
mathematical part of the Scholastic
Aptitude Test. \
In other business:
ODr. Roger Benjamin was voted
provost and senior vice chancellor to

Correction

..In the October 17 edition of
The Pitt News, an error was '
made in the article “Students
Ignoring New Alcohol Policy”
on page five. In referring to the
quote by.Gingei- Mossey, I{.D.,
her name and title were printed
incorrectly. The correct spelling
and title ‘should be: Ginger Mus-
sey, resident assistant (R.A.) in

Task Force Outlines
Computing Changes

In the early 1970's Pitt was a
leader in the field of academic com-
puting. But in recent years, the uni-
versity has fallen behind both in the
development and demand for com-
puting. With that in mind, the uni-
versi'ty’s Task Force on Computer
Usage was created._

The chairman of the task force's .

coordination committee, professor
Norman Bardsley, "presented a
report at Wednesday‘s University
Senate Meeting.

“The'task force is presently estab-
lishing priorities for the new compu-
ter environment,“ Bardsley said.

Text processing‘ is among the
highest priorities, according to
Bardsley. He said that access to
sophisticated printing ‘services must
be provided at some central facility.

Provisions for students is another‘
priority, said Bardsley. Computing
should be readily accessable for their
educational development. ’

' The report included plans that;
.will give students and _ faculty
I members easy access to word pro-it
 cessing equipment, graphics devicesj, . ,

and output facilities such as laser
printers and pliotocomposers. ‘

The total costs:-«to upgrade the
University’s‘= academic computing
system is estimated-’ to be $37 mil-
lion. This figure includes $8" million

. for student access, $6 million for

faculty workstations, $6 million for
office automation, $7 million for
research computing and $10 million
for communications. ,

y If implemented over a three year
period, the expenditures would
represent about 3 percent of the uni-
versity’s budget. A

‘ “This is a modest figure compared
to universities such as Brown who
have allocated $75 million to
upgrade their computer systems,"
Bardsley said. ‘ .

In other business, a report on the
university’s faculty salaries was pre- .
sented by professor Wilfri_ed Dach-
nick, chairman of the senate budget
policies committee. 1

According to the report, the‘aver- _

" age income for a professor at Pitt is

$42,232; as an associate professor
receives $30,000; and an assistant
professor, $23,09l.  . V ’

Unauthorized Student   
Caught On Computer   

By:JOHN GAMBESCIA

A university student, whose name
is being withheld.because of further
judicial‘ proceedings, was escorted
from the Old Engineering Hall by
campus police last Friday afternoon
because of possible unauthorized
computer usage.‘ The suspect was
allegedly using somebody else’s
account number to do work of his
‘own. ,
Allen Grandey, operations man-
ager for the university computer
center, said, “the student was using
an account number that was still
valid but‘ had not been active for
_some time; so when weobserved that
it was all of a sudden active again, we

- watched it closely and took appro-~ _

priate action.” .
Grandey said. that he is. unaware

* of any formal charges as of now. -The

case" may ‘ran under the category of
“theft-of services.” f

The university computer center
has a— written policy ‘that deals with
this type-of computer violation. A
specific judicial procedure is fol-
lowed in order to determine exactly

SG B Questions Write 
Conference Funding  

By DIANE LEFKQWITZ

The Student Government Board
(SGB) voted unanimously yesterday
not to support a recommendation by
the‘ Allocations Committee that

could prevent a’ “dangerous prece- '

' dent” from being set.

The board decided that the Allo- -

cations Committee's refusal to.give
the annual Writer's Conference
$2,000 in funding should. be
reviewed again by the committee.

I Should it again decide not to fund .
the. event, the board could then over-.

ride and reconstruct the funding.
“We have no problem with the
conference,” Allocations Commit-

tee chairman Steve Smith said. “The ,

question we all deal with is the
board’s role in supporting pro-
grams. We could set a dangerous
precedent by supporting these
groups.,” _

Last week, the board gave a vote

“I would not be adverse to sup-

Seminar or the Writer's Conference

worthwhile program.” 0

Last year the SGB helped the

Ref|ectionOf High Hopes

By was cornea

Mervis Hall, the new home for the
Graduate School of Business, was
dedicated yesterday with a cere-
mony attended‘ by the building’s
main benefact_or — Mrs. Myra Mer-
vis — who, along with her late hus-
band, donated $2 million to the
building that bears their name.

Mrs. Mervis attended the ground
breaking last year and has moni-
tored the progress ofthe building for
the past year and a half, up to its
completion.

The building was opened in the
beginning of September and pro-
vides what H. F.- Zoffer, dean of the
school, calls, “a setting of excellence
for our. program.”

Plans for the new facility first sur-
faced in the 1950s when the idea for a
quadrangle with surrounding pro-
fessional buildingsewas created. A
lack of funding forced the business
school’s administrators to‘look else-
where, and eventually, they moved
to -the Cathedral of Learning where
they stayed until the move this
September. '

The site proposed in the 1960s,

Zoffer said, was "in the right field .

area of old Forbes Field. Ironically,
after years of waiting, the originally-
proposed site was approved.

' Theright side of the old outfield
wall sits close to the new building,

-and designers decided to utilize the

feature by putting russet-colored

- accentstripes both in and out of the

building. .
Another feature designed specifi-

cally for the building is the “corpo-

rate look” of the exterior mirror

panels. Zoffer said-that because the
majority of the classes at the new
building will train people to work as
managers and executives, the mod-
ern business-look of the building
reflects the type of projects that will
be going on in the department.

The position of the building,
behind Forbes Quadrangle, created
special problems for the designers,
Zoffer said.

The limestone features of both
Hillman Library and the Quadran-

gle was the logical proposal for the ,

new building. But as this-plan was
developed, it was soon realized that
another white limestone building
would be dwarfed by» the larger
Quadrangle.

A design that would let Mervis
Hall stand out in the shadow of the

' larger buildings was needed; reflec-

tive glass seemed to be the answer.

Mervis Hall has 62 individual
faculty offices, plus offices for (all of
its teaching assistants and program
officers. A library with 100,000-
volume capacity, tiered classrooms,
a behavioral science laboratory and
two computer laboratories, which
are not fully operatioal yet, can also
be found in the building.

While the exterior and most of the
interior is finished, .much of the
expensive equipment that is needed

to make things like the behavioral .

lab operational has not been pur-

f chased due to the lack of funds.

\ “It can be done very quickly,”
Zoffer ‘said, when asked about the
final monies needed. He explained
that they have no firm time frame,
but money will be borrowed against

- the building, and everything needed
will be purchased.

Mervis Hall originally was designed to Iookisimilar to the 'Forbes Quadrangle but that
design was scrapped tor the mirrored look. ' g -

Opinion

\

Re-evaluation
  Needed

' The_ Office of Residence Life’s new alcohol
policyis on the minds of Pitt students once again.
When students returned from their summer
vacations in September, the policy was met by
grumbles and gripes concentrating mainly on the
way it was formed —- without much student
involvement and with a lot of pressure from uni-
versity administration.

But, like most rules, ORL’s policy is being
broken. Students have found a way to deal with
the policy — they are simply ignoring it.

Now the responsibility of enforcing the policy
is being placed on the desk attendants, the RAs
and the RDs —— the majority of whom are stu-
dents and are being forced to spy on their fellow
students. - _

This is unfair. It was the ORL that made the
rule, so it should be ORL that enforces the policy.
The RAs, RDs and desk attendants already have
enough responsibilites and cannot realistically be
expected to monitor the amount of alchohol
being brought into the dorms. A

Short of body and room searches — which
would be a violation of students’ rights — there is
no possible. way that this policy can be enforced
as it was meant to be.

Students are finding all possibleways to bring
alcohol into the dorms, and the alternatives they
are finding is somewhat scary. Instead of lugging
in cases or six-packs of beer, they are bringing in
hard liquor. Hard liquor is easier to hide and can
be stored easily in a purse or a backpack.

‘ORL should be concerned about the course the
policy is taking. Students will drink no.matter
what the rules are, even if they are underage.

ORL should realize that where there is a will,
there is a way and students will find a way to
smuggle in alcohol at all costs.
It’s time for _ORL to re-evaluate the alcohol
-policy it implemented in September. With more
- student involvement and a more realistic
approach to the situation, maybe it can come up
with a policy that will work and give the univer-
sity a good image. Maybe it will even be one with
which the students can live.

Hillman’s Purpose Not Social

Dear Editor, V

Hillman’s reputation as a place to
gather for social interaction is read-

ily accepted by Pitt students with"

amused chuckles. Jokes are fre-
quently heard around campus and
satirical remarks printed in your
publication regarding the usefulness
of the library as somewhere to study.
Through these types of reinforce-

ments, the notion that Hillman is 1

nothing more than a gathering place
for good friends and good conversa-
tion (?) is further strengthened, as
clearly indicated by the behavior of
many of its patrons. Because we
have accepted without question the
idea that the library is a four-story
party room, it continues to serve this
purpose accordingly. Speaking for
myself and other students who
would like to be able to study in
Hillman, we would-like it noted that
there is a segment of the Pitt com-
munity sharing a feeling of displeas-
ure over the present uses of the
library. ’ .

Based upon the norms of our
society in the not-so-distant past, a
library was to be a QUIET placeto
conduct research, become engrossed

in studies or browse leisurely for"

reading material. While the world
was rushing at a frantic pace outside,
inside the library's respected walls
the atmosphere was (to be) hushed
and deliberate. It was to be a refuge
from reality providing the perfect
environment to grasp the theories of
physics or teachings of Marx. It was
to be run by spectacled, gray-haired
librarians who never failed to “Sh-h-
h-h” the patron speaking above a
whisper. (Before you even begin to
think that such places cease to exist,

 

please be aware that the libraries of
some universities are exactly as des-
cribed above, sans the spectacled
librarians.)

Contrast these ideals to: the din
on the first ﬂoor of Hillman that gets
so loud that some students there
can’t grasp the stories presented in
their USA Today; the students that
throw themselves over two chairs
and a table while sleeping with their
radios blaring through dangling
headsets; some of the Hillman per-
sonnel, frequently making as much
noise as the table of twelve ‘discuss-

ring last night's party; the graffiti‘

carved and inked permanently in
walls and furniture. The shortcom-
ings of Hillman’s atmosphere are -
endless.

The responsibility of using the
library for its intended purposes

.rests solely with the students; there-

fore, to the students who meet (or
are responsible for) the above cri-
teria, I address you as the irresponsi-

. ble, the inconsiderate, the rude and

the destructive. Did you ever con-
sider that some of us are paying

thousands of dollars for more than a
good time? That your tuition
increases just might have something
to do with your willful destruction?
That some of us might not- give a
damn about what you did last night
and don’t care to hear about it? That
Hillman is the only place some stu-

dents have to go to study? That there -

is an expensively refurbished build-
ing across the street from the library
if you have an uncontrollable desire
to bullshit? I would ventureto say
that you never considered any of
these questions and even if you did,
it probably wouldn’t make a bit of
difference to'you anyway~—after all,
why would you start being responsi-

‘ble, considerate adults now?

‘Satire ’ /3
Defined

Dear Editor:
“At first reading, Chris Bos-
so’s article (Pitt News, Oct. 14,
- 1983) is an amusing satire of aca-
demic life at Pitt.” So begins
Eliyna Somhgi’s ‘pompous and
lengthy letter tothe editor of Oct.
19, 1983. As Ms. Somhgi is gra-
cious enough to label Mr. Bos-
so’s prose as “satire", one
wonders if she is referring to the .
same_ satire that The American
Heritage Dictionary defines as “a

derision or wit in any form is

True; Boss’s questions are
ones'that undergrads deserve to
have answered, but he is examin-
ing them from a satirical point of

. view. This being the case, it is an
overreaction of Ms. Somhgi that
leads her to denounce Bosso’s“
comments as “betraying an
insensitivity which is not only
disturbing but disheartening as
well” and “typical of many grad-

' uate students assigned to teach

undergraduates." Frankly, it is a

tribute to his comic sense that

Mr. Bosso can take a set of basi-

cally serious inquiries and give
them a humorous twist. If Ms.

Somhgi’s letter pointed out any-

thing, it was this.

Guild Under Surveillance

MARTY WILLIS

The National Lawyers Guild has
obtained one-half million pages of
documents from the federal govern-
ment revealing illegal break-ins,
wiretaps and spying on guild
members and their clients, attorney
Mike Healey of the guild said Wed-
nesday night. .

Healey spoke at the Pitt law
school in a program entitled “The
Intelligence Network” which also
featured a film outlining a complex
nationwide surveillance network
headed by the FBI, CIA and various
polige agencies.

Healey said that the guild, which
includes some 7,000 to 8,000
members, has been inﬁltrated by
about 2,500 different informants
over the last 20 to 30 years. This and
other information was released
through a lawsuit currently pending
in a federal court in New York City,
he said, adding that “we’re still sort-
ing through the information."

“We know the FBI was invol-
ved...we’d always underestimated
the extent "to which we were being
spied on by different police agencies.
We knew something about it, but
we'd always belittled it. When we
brought the suit, we learned of a
number of break-ins into guild offi-
ces and private offices of individual
guild members...frankly, people in

the guild were very surprised,” Hea- .

ley said in a telephone interview
yesterday. _

“The Reagan Adminisrration...is
trying to legalize its surveillance
under the guise of fighting crime,” he
said. “In some cases involving
known or suspected criminals, the

These salaries were compared
with 211 other universities such as the
University of Pennsylvania, Penn
State and Temple. Daehnick
showed that the salaries for profes-
sors have improved since 1973 in
relation to other Pennsylvania
schools.

“For the profession at large, the
university’s average income is
almost ‘exactly [within $90.00] that
of the average income among the
country,” said Deahnick.

Another report on university-
industry cooperation, “The Univer-
sity Perspective,” was presented by
professor Roger Ahlbrandt, assist-
ant provost. He provided an update
on the Western Pennsylvania

"Advanced Technology Center. The
center is jointly sponsored by CMU
and Pitt. It recently received $3.35

million from the state’s Ben Frank- ’

lin Partnership Board for the 1983-
84 program that started in
September. Along with funding
from the federal government, the
universities and industry, the pro-
gram has in excess of $10 million.
The main objective of the Ben
Franklin Program is job creation
through research and development
in such areas as robotics, biomedical
technology, coal, metals,‘ steel pro-
cessing and advanced materials such
as laser beams. The program will
also assist entrepreneurs, small busi-
nesses and regional industries.
Education training and retraining
is another element of the program.
Ahlbrandt said the aim is to ensure
the availability of high-quality edu-
cation, training and retraining pro-
grams to meet the labor force of our
region. »

The Pitt News_, Friday, October 2i. I983 ‘ ”

courts have permitted police agen-
cies to spy on citizens”, Healey
explained.

“When you take those rights away
from people who are supposedly
horrible criminal defendants, you
take them away from all of the
society.

The documentary film, produced
by the Campaign for Political
Rights, a Washington-based lobby
group, showed several examples of
political repression orches_trated by
the FBI. In perhaps the most widely-
acknowledged case, the late civil
rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.
was the target of a massive FBI cam-

paign in the 1960s that included not

only surveillance but also harass-
ment, according to the film.
“A lot of materials have been

released through the Freedom of ,

Information Act about that harass-
ment. Hoover had a fixation about
King...I thing the FBI has even con-
ceded that," Healey added. “I know
they haven’t denied it. At any rate,
it’s pretty much accepted now.

The program also featured a leo-
ture and slide show by Dana Reed, a
Pitt undergraduate who recently
spent two months in Nicaragua,
where the CIA is currently conduct-
ing “covert operations" against that
country’s government. “The goals of
the CIA are not to harass or desta-

bilize the Nicaraguan government,” ‘

Reed said. “The goalis to overthrow
it, just like in Chile.” _

One young woman in the
audience, who described herself as a
“former political activist,” said she
knows thather telephone has been
bugged. “It makes you feel so bad
when you hear that extra little click
on your phone,” she said.

Methodist minister Robert G.
White, who serves as the campus
minister for Pitt, Carnegie-Mellon
University and Chatham and Car-
low Colleges, was also in the
audience Wednesday night. White
revealed the psychological feeling of
frustration that results from being
spied on by government agents.

“I know that my phone's being
tapped—and that's okay. It’s not
okay, but it’s okay. I can’t let myself
be worried over that. My position is
that I’m not paranoid because I’m
alert to it, but the government
clearly is. In terms of my being able
to talk to somebody over the phone,
just considereing that it’s a three-
way conversation when it should be
a two-way conversation, there's a
real sense of powerlessness there. _To

me, this is Big Brother right here."

YMCA

Convention

Slated

By MIKE BUCSKO

Visitors from across the country
and the world will be in Pittsburgh
this weekend for the National Asso-
ciation of Student YMCA's (NASY)
sixth annual convention.

The Collegiate YMCA of Pitts-
burgh, with its main branch in the
William Pitt Union, will be the host
of the convention. This year’s con-
vention, the second to be held in an

, urban area and one of the largest

ever, will welcome the highest
number of international registrants
ever, according to Beverly Gillot,
president of the leadership team and
one of the coordinators of the event.

Gillot, a four-year Y volunteer,
said the convention will follow the
theme, “Thinking globally, acting

locally,” adopted at last year's con- .

vention, which was held at the Uni-
versity of Minnesota, located in
Minneapolis.

“We’ll start on an international
level and work to a local level," she
said.

The activities begin today at 2
p.m. with the registration of the esti-
mated 200 participants, 15 of whom
will come from countries such as
Brazil, India and Uganda. Accomo-
dations for the visitors will vary,
according to Gillot.

She said arrangements were made
with Pitt, Duquesne and Carlow to
use dormitory space while some stu-
dents will stay in_ private homes,
called “homestays,” and hotels.
Domestic representatives are com-
ing from as far away as Hawaii and
Washington State.

Pitt, Duquesne and Carlow are all
members of the Collegiate YMCA
of Pittsburgh, the largest student
YMCA in the country, although
most of the activity will take place at
Pitt. On Saturday evening, there will
be a banquet in the Grand Ballroom
of the William Pitt Union, followed
by a dance at Duquesne at 9 p.m.

Norman Mustafa, head of the
transportation committee, said
transportation to and from arrival
points like the airport and the bus
station is being provided by vans
borrowed from other branches of
the Pittsburgh YMCA. He said most
of the guests are arriving by 4 p.m.
and will be picked up by volunteer
student drivers. These vans will also
provide transportation to the activi-
ties _at Duquesne, Mustafa said.

Although only nine representa-
tives — six student volunteers and
three staff members — from the
Pittsburgh YMCA will be in attend-
ance, they represent only a fraction
of the 600-member volunteer force.
The average representation from
other schools is four members, and a
total of 21 schools will be ‘repre-
sented according to Mustafa. ‘‘ ‘

Pittsburgh was selected as the site
for this year’s convention when its
bid was chosen at last year’s event in
Minneapolis, Mustafa said.

Highlights for the three-day con-

: ference include aneaddress by Solom
. Cousins, president of YMCA of the
1 USA, and a workshop headed by the
director of special programs for the
' national ‘
- Goncharoff.

YMCA, Nicholas

Chamber Music
Scheduled

The Carnegie-Mellon
Chamber Orchestra will present
the second program in its sub-
scription series at 8 p.m., Sunday
and Monday, Oct. 30 and 31, in
Alumni Concert Hall in the Col-
lege of Fine Arts. .

Under the direction of Kypros
Markou, the Chamber Orchestra
will perform Johann ‘Christian
Bach’s Sinfonia in Major, Schu-
bert’s Symphony No. 3 in D
Major and Mozart’s Concerto
for Clarinet and Orchestra. Wil-‘
liam King, a CMU graduate stu-
dent, will be featured soloist in
the Mozart concerto.

Knight In Pat's Armor

Dear Stan Wozniak:

Your Oct. 14 Showcase review of Pat
Benatar's Live From Earth album con-
tained a kicker last line (journalism
talk, Stan) that read, "It’s a line of
bullshit, yes, but so is the rest of
this." -

- Well, Stan, after , reading your
review entitled Line ‘From Earth, I
couldn't agree more with your quote
because your review was waist-deep‘
in bullshit. This quote also showed
that even you have a hard time read-
ing your reviews.

The review of Benatar clearly
shows you have never seen a Benatar
concert. Because you stated in your
article, and I quote, "Behind a live
band, her voice sounds severely dam-
aged singing rock-and-roll." Well,
Stan, if you could have been at the
Stanley Theatre in '81 for "The
Crimes of Passion Tour," maybe you
would have noticed that Pat Benatar

can sing " behind a live band — .

because Pat put on a singing perfor-
mance that few people in
rock-and-roll could match.

Singing ‘a cappella on "We Live For
Love" (Did you ever hear this one,
Stanleyl’), one could have heard a pin
drop as the mesmerized audience
looked on with open mouths. On my
way out of the concert, I overheard at
least six different people praising
Pat's voice. Oh, by the way, Stanley,
you 'obviouslybdidn't know that Pat
Benatar has a-four-octave voice.

Then,’ last year on her -'82 tour,

Civic Arena and put on another fine
show. But, being fair, I must admit
that her voice didn't sound as good as
it did at her previous Stanley Theatre

performance, but what singer does
- sound as good inside the Civic Arena

as they do on vinyl? Even Paul
McCartney, Mick Jagger and Roger
Daltrey 'didn't sound their best the
first time they sang in a large area.
But Stan, this is rock-and-roll, so if
you want vocal clarity, go down to
Oasis or National Record Mart and
buy some Bee Gees or Dolly Parton
records. ~

I bet the first ‘time you heard the
Stones’ tune "Tumbling Dice,” you
couldn't decipher every word that

V spumed, out of Mick's mouth, and

that was on the studio version.

So, Stan, the next time Pat goes on
tour, come andsee me, and I'll buy
you a ticket, since you're obviously
too cheap to open up your own moth-
eaten wallet. Besides, it will be
worth my while to show yoiia real
female rocker who just happens to be
the best female air-guitar player (a
little_ music talk, Stan) and best
female singer in rock-and-roll today.
Who knows, maybe you'll even learn
what rock-and-roll is all about!

By DOLORES RICE

”...At every level in one’s progress
up that staggeringly high pyramid,
the world was once more divided into

J those men who had the right stuff to

*§

,:_.

rmra:wz2:

continue the climb and those who had
to be left behind...” (Taken from the
book, The'Right Stuff, by Tom Wolfe).

Now, through the talented eye of
screenwriter and director Philip
Kaufman, this tale of American hero-

ism is brought to the screen in The

Right Stuff.

. Kaufman, co-author of Raiders ofthe
Lost Ark and director of Invasion of the
Body Snatchers, succeeds by not making
the film like a ninth-grade science
class, but rather, keeps it fast-moving
and interesting. It is more than the
history of flight; _The Right Stuffpulls at
your heart with the emotional
trauma that the test pilots’ wives
experience and tugs at the sides of
your—mouth to smile with pride when
the first astronaut reaches the sky
beyond." ' "

- The film spans 15 years (in three
hours /and 15 minutes), from Chuck
Yeager’s (Sam Shepard) reaching
MACH 1 to break the sound barrier
to Gordon ”Gordo” Cooper's (Dennis
Quaid) being the last man to fly solo
in 1963.‘ .

That ineffable quality of excite-
ment gone by is resurrected by Kauf-
man and the talented array of actors.
The ”right stuff" is defined by Tom

SHOWCASE. Friqziy. ctober 21 1933

Wolfe as the unnamed qualities of a
pilot's character which enable him to

move up the pyramid towards the"

apex. The ”right stuff” was present in
those seven astronauts, but expe-
cially in Yeager, with whom the film
begins and ends. Day by day, Yeager
would chase the demons as . he‘
”punched holes in the sky," not for
the public eye, but for his own satis-
faction. Yeager denouncedthe idea of
becoming an astronaut, referring to
them as ”lab rabbits.” But as the
Space Age is entered, Yeager is left
behind. Ina tender scene, Barbara
Hershey (The Entity}, who. plays
”Glamorous Glennis" Yeager, tells
her husband he must always keep
reaching» if he wants her to stay with
him.

The men depicted in this film are
heroes (one ‘may eventually become
pr_es_ident). They exude personal
commitment, dedication and honor
towards their country. The actors —
who were believable in their charac-
terizations of the seven Mercury
astronauts — portrayed: Scott Car-
penter (Charles Frank), Alan Shepard
(Scott Glenn), Ed Harris’ (John
Glenn), Walter Schirra, (Lance Hen-
riksen), ”Gordo” Cooper (Dennis

Quaid), Gus Grissom (Fred Ward)
and Donald ”Deke” Slayton (Scott
Paulin). '

None of theactors overshadows
the others; all are adequate. Ed Harris

portrays John Glenn, seems to over-
extend the ”goody-two—shoes” image
in the beginning, but as the story pro-
gresses, the viewer realizes that
Glenn's personality is genuine. He

becomes the unspoken leader of the

seven.
Kaufman not only concentrates on

A the men, however. The wives. are

shown as being just as important as
they support their husbands on the
road to fame. As the seven men
shared a camaraderie, so did the
wives as they all gathered .in their
respective homes to watch their hus-
bands ‘climb into the space capsules.
In one particular scene, Trudy
Cooper (Pamela Reed) refuses to
allow Lyndon B. Johnson (played
excellently by Donald Moffat of The
Thing) to interview Annie Glenn
while husband John is in orbit. Annie
(Mary Jo Deschanel), because of a
speech impediment, was petrified to
be on television. In the same instance,

John Glenn tells Annie not to allow"
Johnson (then the vice—president) in

the house, regardless of the amounts "I

of publicity it would mean to him.
As well as having great emotional

_ impact, the film has much comic relief
— the initial rockets’ refusing to lift’
off, for example, or the monkeys’ per-n 7

forming the

same tests as the
astronauts. '

.Another interesting facet of the I

film was the inclusion of actual

NASA film clips from the event’
which took place 20 years ago.

Kaufman effectively exuded the
”I’m proud to be an American” theme
throughout the movie. But, as stated

previously, it is much more._tha-n a;

mere documentation of the Space
Age accomplishments. The Right Stuff

delves into the characters’ feelings. ‘l

and aspirations and “evaluates the
emotional impact of the historical

’ events, which is something your

ninth-grade science class didn't do.

Sweat-n-Smoke   & 
Dom DiSilvio And The Decaa

 Yearsof Frenzied 

1/

 

Performers who played at the Decade in the early days of their careers
include: The Police, The Pretenders, and U2. .

By MARK MARTINI

lhe Police, Pat Benatar, U2, Zebra,
the I-Iouserockers, the Divinyls, Ste-

vie Ray Vaughn, the Romantics, the

Beat, the Ramones, the Silencers and

A Joe Jackson: just a few of the rock ’n’

roll reasons to celebrate the 10 years
of music at Pittsburgh's premiere
showcase club.

Owner Dom DiSilvio opened the
‘doors of the Decade on October 22,
1973, and in cooperation with Pitts-
burgh promoter Danny Kresky, has
presented some of the world's top
rock artists in what Dom calls "a

grass-roots type of setting.” The

Decade has received national atten-
tion because of its reputation for
showcasing up-and-coming bands on
the brink of national success. Rated
as Pittsburgh's no. =1 rock 'n' roll club

by Pittsburgh Magazine, the Decade has

also been featured in Rolling Stone and
Billboard. '

The man behind it all is a very Ital-
ian gentleman who could have easily
taken Brando's role in The Godfather.
The I-Iouserockersfl Joe Grushecky
calls him "an uncle to the bandﬁ-'Norm

Nardini says Dom treats him "like a «

ll

' Ten years ago, Dom bought the
Atwood Gardens, "a shot-and—a—beer
joint,” closed it down, completely
renovated it, and reopened it as the
Decade with the intention that it
would be a '50s revival club. The
name came from the association that
Dom and his wife made with the '50s
as ”a decade of the music we liked."
For its first fiveyears, the Decade
featured '50s revival bands but also
laid the framework for its future by

giving. local bands of the era a chance -

to present themselves onstage.

"Being in the shadow of the univer- .
lsity, this has always been a crowded,
hustle-bustle type of area, so the ‘

bands would have the chance to get in
front of a lot of people," says Dom‘.
In 1978,’ Pittsburgh rock promoter
Danny Kresky called Dom with the
proposition of transforming the
Decade into a rock showcase club. "I

‘was a little leery at first,” Dom’
explains, "due mainly to the Decade's

small size.” However, Kresky offered
to book the Ramones for two consec-
utive nights (March 6 and 7, 1979),
and Dom decided to ”go for it." Reno-
vations were made, such as making
the stage bigger and the tables
smaller, and on October 31, 1978, the
David Iohansen Group became the
first featured showcase act at the
Decade.

The Decade is a very-unique club
for many reasons. Bill Pascale, the
Decade's manager for over the past

two years, cites the club's intimate .

venue as an important factor in it
success. a

”People can really see the groups -
see them sweat, see them come onto
the stage, touch them and even talk’
to them after the show,” Pascale
explains. .

Dom adds that, ”sure it's crowded
and it's smoky and everything, but
they get close. I mean, they're not like
ants; it's not like the arena where the

band's so small that they have to

V show them on TV monitors."

Kresky feels this intimacy is impor-
tant because "the next time the band
comes through town, they will have
already had some exposure and peo-
ple will say, 'Yeah, I like this band. I
talked to them whenthey were at the
Decade.’ This has a lot to do with
building a strong grass-roots follow-
ing, which helps so much_ with the’

,-L,
, band's subsequent appearances," he-‘

said. Two bands that Kresky feels
this formula applies to recently are
the Pretenders and U2.

Dom is proud of the fact that the
Decade is "one of the only rock-and-
roll clubs in the country that has
food." Home of the 21 varietiesof
Decade Dagwood sandwiches, the

club has served some 250 lunches 

day since it opened. Because the bar
serves food, it is permitted to remain
open seven days a week,.so unlike
other clubs the ‘Decade has music
every night, except on Mondays dur-
ing the football season.

The Decade is "also known for its
distinctive decor. Parachutes, T-
shirts and bar stools hangfrom the

ceilings. "Status Cymbals," donatea#;-

by various groups, fill the right side
wall of (the stage. Over the bar are
marching band hats stolen from Pitt
opponents at football games (”Half

the things maybe are stolen," Dom

says). On all of the walls hang
hundreds of street signs and pictures;
there are two urinals hanging on the
walls near the bathrooms ("You'd be
surprised how many drunk guys try
to use them,” Dom revealed); there

are mannequins, iron gates and flash-  I

ing Christmas wreaths that hang-
year-round. Anything and every-
thing; lewd,'rude and subdued; and

the major portion is donated by cus- .

tomers. '.'We don't have enough room
to hang all the things that people
want us to," says Bill, adding, "even I
still find things that I've’ never seen
before that have been here all along.”
Dom, feels that the decor reflects the

personalities of, himself and themir»

Decade staff. One thing's for certain:
there's no lack of attention-grabbing
decorations. There's no room for
boredom. I

For many local musicians, Dom and
the Decade hold a special place in
their hearts. The ‘Houserockers
signed their MCA recording contract
at the Decade before a special engage-
mentl honoring the event. (Funny

story: MCA's ~Meatloaf was on—ha nd 
to introduce the band. -Everyone was”

in the kitchen during the actual con-
tract signing, and as Dom recalls, ”I
saw this ugly guy and I said, 'Who are
you?’ and someone said ‘Meatloaf.’
and I said, ‘Boy, you look like a mea-
-tloaf, I don't want you in my kitchen,
get out!’ ") '

According to Dom, the House-
rockers wrote the song "]unior’s Bar"

about he and the Decade. Guitaristgk,

Joe Crushecky says that the Decade
was "the first place where we could
play our own music and be accepted.
The whole Decade scene has helped
us tremendously.” ‘

Norm Nardini says, "When I first
started my group, I was playing at the

says. . ' ‘

It's things like this that have led to
the Decade's reputation as "the best
rocl<—and—roll club in Pittsburgh.”

The man most responsible for that
reputation is Dom, and his attitude
towards his club. ”If I didn't have a

‘good time here,-I wouldn't be here,
and if I had to change the music, I'd
quit,” he says. ”I like rock—and-roll;

. it's my life. I have seven kids, it keeps

, me young enough [he's 44] to know
that when they're talking about the
Police, I'm Knot worried about the
fuckin” police coming through the
door.” V.

Joe Grusheckyﬁsays that the impor? V
tance of the Decade is that it give
bands a venue ”away from the Top 40

“clubs. Everyone enjoys playing there
because you have the freedom to do
what you want."

Norm Nardini agrees. ’’For me, my

, bread and butter is playing to people
while they're partying; it's like a
church service.to me, and this is the
perfect place to do it,” he explains.

« ”People need to come and get nuts
sometimes, and they need to do it
together, to know‘ that it's OK to get

‘guts, and this is the best place for it. If

“I couldn't c_ome down here and get

. nuts every once in a while, I would

, jones.” Norm also praised the Decade
for its ”metropolitan feel” as opposed
to the ”suburbanized” feel of the
other area clubs.

y ”People come here with the idea
that’, even if they don't know who's
playing, they might miss something '
that could be big later on," Dom says.
&You have to take a chance."

Pavone says that ”even after play_-
ing out six to seven nights a week, my
husband (Glenn Pavone, guitarist for
Billy Price and the Keystone Rhythm
Band) and I still have to come down to
the Decade just to see what's going
on.” » ' '

Kresky says that ”people look to
play the Decade when they're in
d_’_ittsburgh” because of the Decade's
. reputation and because ”Dom is very
amicable to bands; he cooperates with j
them." Norm Nardini says that «
’’within 300-400 miles, there ain't no
club that has bettershows and more
consistent shows than this one,” and

MUMMER
XTC
Virgin Records

I've been dancing around my
roomfor the last hour or so, and
I'm still not ready to call it quits.
M ummer is on my turntable, and
I really hate to take it off. Ema-
nating from this disc are sounds
and emotions so rich and so true
you can't help but succumb to
-the energetic sensation that

~ overcomes both heart and soul.

Side 1 of XTC’s latest basks in
romantic images of life and love:

_ ...a heart without love is a song with no

words/And a tune to which no one is
listening/So your heart must give love
and you'll find that/You shine like the
rain on the leaves you'll be glistening.
The innocent, simple, young
man fully" submerged in this
romantic vision voices his
unconditional devotion on the
albums’ three love songs, writ-
ten by Andy Partridge, which
are "Beating Hearts," "Love on a
Farmboy’s Wages” and ”Great
Fire.” Listening to these tracks,
one is overwhelmed by the
optimism the lyrics embody:
”Dancing us from the darkest
night is the rhythm of love/Po-

wered on by the beating of '

hearts." ’

These passionate lyrics are
powered by vocals that epito-
mize the sincere lover, the truly
romantic courtier; this gentle-‘

man embraces his new outlook

with fervor.

The remaining songs on the
album are as fully spirited as the
‘love songs, but are tinged with a
more critical, if not satirical,
note. The optimism of love is
overshadowed by the "games

people play’_’ in both ”Wonder- _ -

land" and "Me and the Wind." In
”Human Alchemy,” Partridge
paints a vivid picture of slavery:
”Blood the colour of the rain
that grew our wicked har-
vest/Black the colour icing on
our cake” and concludes that
”Although we held the whip,
youlknow we were/The real
slaves...To alchemy, human
alchemy.”
After a full album of success-
ful portrayals of existence —
the human condition -— XTC
closes Mummer with a condem-
nation of the music industry,
the exploiter of those unfortu-
nate enough to. beicaught up in
the indulgent atmosphere.
Every song on this LP is
equipped with the ability to cap-
ture and mobilize the listener.
Whether ‘the lyrics sing out
hope for mankind or satirize
human mistakes, one is ener-
gized by the powerful drives
that construct a basis from
which the expressive melodies
flow. The distinctive sound of
Andy Partridge, Colin Mould-
ing and Dave Gregory tho-
roughly satiates the listeners’
desire for unique rhythms and
lyrical profundity; it's a combi-
nation that generates a fresh
new awareness of humanity
and‘ emotion in music.

‘SHOWCASE, Friday: October 2|’, 1983

Dancing The Llnalefinahle

\

':By LINDA HENRY ’

The Pittsburgh Dance Alloy opens
its 1983-84 season tonight with a per-
formance featuring nationally-
known dancer/choreographer Bill
Evans. Curtain time is 8 p.m. at Cha-
tham College's Eddy Theatre.

The Alloy works as repertory com-
pany, an unusual feature for a mod-

ern dance troupe. Modern companies 4

are usually put together by one per-
son -— a choreographer —— and the
performances are a reflection of that
persoh’s work. (For example, Kei
Takei, who will be at the Pittsburgh
Playhouse next weekend.)

The Alloy performs the work of.
‘nationally and

internationally-
known choreographers, as well as
dances by company members. ”This

. affords the audience a chance to see

different things happening in mod-
ern dance instead of one person's
point of view,” says Laura Wenneker
of the Alloy.

Original member Elsa Limbach is
co-artistic director along with Uni-
versityof Pittsburgh faculty member
Susan Gillis, who will be dancing this
weekend, as well as choreographer
Bill Evans.

Evans will dance "Jazz Three

Ways,” choreographed by Daniel_

Nargrin and described as ”asymmet-
rical, offbeat, rubbery, hip-swaying
movement, with surprise, parodying
gestures and taunting satire.” He will
also perform a dance of his own.

The Alloy dancers will perform
”Calabash Boom,” a dramatic, rhyth-
mic African ballet choreographed
specifically for the company; and an
original new work by Julie Eggs-
puehler, which is a parody of John
Belushi and Dan Akroyd in their
movie The Blues Brothers entitled ”On a
Mission From God,” set to "The Peter
Gunn Theme” by_Henry Mancini.

The final dance of the , evening
”expresses many moods of love and
culminates in free-wheeling move-
ments,” said Wenneker. Entitled
"Non-Fiction. Love Songs,” it is cho-
reographed by J. Michael Kane to' the
musicof Pete Tqwnshend.

The Pittsburgh Dance Alloy’s next
performance can be seen from Dec. 9
through 11. Show time for the cur-
rent production is at 8 p.m. tonight
and tomorrow and at 2 p.m. this Sun-

‘ day. For tickets and information, call

421-9747.

THE PITTSBURGH DANCE

’Colal Storage’, Explores Death With

By JONATHAN KUNKEL
"Be interesting.” This, the last line

i’ of the first act of Ronald Ribman’s

play, Cold Storage, now playing at the
Famous ‘Rider Culture Center, sums
up the play completely.

Cold Storage takes one through var-
ious ups and _downs but never leaves
one bored or unfulfilled. It always fol-
lows the line, "Be interesting,” to the
letter, no matter what is being said.
When one of the leads talks inces-
santly about fruits and vegetables, it
is entertaining rather than boring,
even when a good portion‘ of time is
spent on such a trivial topic.

The play, which takes place on a
hospital roof garden, concerns two
cancer patients: Joseph Parmigian,
who is terminally ill with the disease

and is ready to die, and Richard Lan-
dau, who is having exploratory tests
to see if he has the disease or not.
Throughout the evening, the charac-
ters talk about life and personal ex-
periences. Parmigian tries to teach
Landau about how important com-
munication is. "If one does not com-
municate, they, in a sense, die inside,”
says Parmigian. , L ’
Landau, at first, is unwilling to tell
Parmigian anything about himself,
but after some insistence and wise
words from Parmigian, Landau opens
up fully and exposes his innermost
feelings to Parmigian. I
Ribman exposes the feelings of two

completely different people and the

anxieties and expectations they have

while they are waiting to die. He also

shows us that death means nothing
to someone who is already dead
inside. He does this through Parmi-
gian. Parmigian's spirit, determina-
tion- to keep himself ‘alive by
communicating and drive to come
through it all convinces Landau to

come out of his shell. By doing so, V

Landau becomes more at ease about
dying and, by the end of the play, is on
his way to possessing the spirit and
determination of Parmigian. .

Paula Wiedel’s direction centers
more around Landau's communica-

tion hang-up than Parmigian's use of p

it. She also has the actors going at a

pace that compliments not only them, S

but the play itself. Her staging is
innovative and natural, considering
one, and sometimes both, of the

' Gus Wiedl’s interpretation-of Par-
migian was truly moving. Hislines
flowed and he sounded as if he were

V saying the lines for the first time.

Neal A. Hemphill’s Landau was,.at,
times sing-songy and a little uncon-
versational. He did, however, seem
believable as a successful art buyer.
John Donnelly’s set was plain and
realistic. It got the feeling across

without detracting from the play J

itself, as do some flashy sets.

Cold Storage is an evening of riveting
and often-times comic theater. It is a
shame that such talent was wasted
last Sunday night, though, when only
four people were in the audience.
Such quality ‘theater as this should
not go unnoticed -

By CHARLIE O'HARA

 The Pitt men’s cross country

team will travel to Boston Col-
lege tomorrow for the Big East
Conference championship,
where the gun is set to go off at l
.p.m._

There is little question that the
Panthers will have to take a giant
step up to the level of perfor-
mance necessary to competing in
this one. ‘ ~

“We've got to do better than
we did last year (eighth place in
—' the nine—team conference),” Pitt

coach John Vasvary said. “We

off of our performances earlier in
the season.” i
The‘ Panthers have only com-
peted in two meets so far, not
exactly a stacked schedule.
-In» the season opener, the
Panthers received no competi-
tion from Duquesne and Robert

W011.

R In their second appearance of

the season, Pitt was swamped by
two well-balanced teams in Ohio
University and West Virginia.

have is that they are reasonably

he should be able-to perform
4 nearly up to standard.

As for the competition, “the
Big East is an excellent cross
country .conference,” Vasvary
said. “Providence, like every
year, is loaded. Villanova and
Boston College went to South
Africa and Ireland for recruiting
trips over the summer. We’re
expecting them to have very
good teams. St. John’s had a
young team last year, and they

Y did very well; Georgetown could
be the most improved team.”

In the Paul Short Invitational‘
(an important cross country
meet involving almost all of the
good teams from the East) held
earlier in the season, the Hoyas
placed third behind the 1982
NCAA champion team,
Wisconsin. ,

Syracuse lost Jim O’Connel,
its No. 1 man a year ago, to grad-

. uation, leaving a hole that will

Providence, short of not show-

runner-up Steve Binns and third

return and are expected to pro-

title again.

’ There should be contenders,
though. "

Villanova, with its great tradi-
tion — Eamonn Coglan, Sidney
Maree and Mike England, - to
name a few — could pose a
threat. . - ' '

Led by seniors Brian O’Keefe
and Marcus O’Sullivan, the
Wildcats have the experience
that should at least put them in
place to take home the runner-up
spot.

Georgetown is probably out of
the Panthers’ reach, but _St.
J ohnfs and Syracuse should be a
bit more their speed.

Pitt will be sending seniors
Todd Colas, Bill Moorhead,
Garland Brown and'Tom Bailey
to the line for thevfinal time ‘as '
harriers (cross country runners,
for those who look twice at that
word every time it is printed).

“We'll give a 110 percent,”
Brown said. “lt’s our last time
together; we want to be the best
we can.”

“As a team-, we have a lot to
prove,” Moorhead said. “A good
end to the cross~country season
serves a springboard to a success-
ful indoor [track] season, [our
specialty]."

“The team is basically young,
but it’s going to get a whole lot
better in the next couple years,”
Colas said. “[The Big East] has
some very good teams and some
mediocre ones. We’re not among
the mediocre, but we’re not
among the very good, either.” V

“Realistically, we won’t win,”
Bailey said. “But we'll finish a lot
better than last_year."

In addition to the seniors,
freshman John Thomas and jun-
ior Mickey Rihtarchik will
represent the Panthers. As of late
Thursday night, Vasvary had not
decided who the- seventh man

I would be.

Although the Big East is pri-
marly touted as a basketball con-

rink of a schedule, bowl bid pros-
pects are slowly being dredged up.

Louisville helped, but the next two .

weeks should prove to be more
decisive.

‘With last week’s Cardinal shel-
lacking still on the Panthers’ minds,
the skating remains effortless as Pitt
prepares to meet Navy in Annapolis’
Navy-Marine Corps Memorial Sta-
dium tomorrow.

Kickoff is‘ set for 1:30 p.m.

The Midshipmen are currently
holding a 2-4 record, though that is
taking things for granted. Leading
the way, if you will, is the NCAA's
No. l rushing and all-purpose yard-
age leader, Napoleon McCallum.
McCallum is the backbone of
*Navy_’s offensive appendage.

He is raking in 157.7 yards per
game on the ground, and when he
decides to add pass-catching capa-
bilities, amasses 233.5 yards per
game. Last week, he had a career
high 229 yards and three, TDs in
Navy’s 37-29 victory over Princeton.

McCallum is 54 yards short of
1,000 but hardly long on playing
backfield terrorist. In fact, Navy has
not'shown much at all so far, save‘
for a shutout over “dominatable”
Lehigh.

“I don’t know if there have been
any pleasant surprises,” said Navy
"coach Gary Tranquill, who isn’t sure
who he is kidding. “There is a lot of
‘inexperience and we are struggling.

“We’re making critical mistakes at
critical times and can’t put anything
together offensively.”

‘At 6-2 and 208-lbs., McCallum is
‘put together very well for a ransack-
ing tailback.

“His secret is he‘s deceptively

, quick,” Tranquill added. “He __has
subtle quickness and has the ability '

to break through tackles. We’ve
asked him to do many things for us,

1 and he’s done everything.”

“Napoleon’s a genuinetailback,”
Pitt head coach Foge Fazio said.
“He’s a verydangerous performer.
We have to be on our toes and can’t
miss any tackles. The defense has to
be in the right spots.

“We can’t have tandems with peo-
ple ﬂying all over the place. It must
be a team effort; if not, Napoleon is
someone who can take advantage of
that.”

Last week, Pitt defensive line
coach Don Thompson scouted this
cannonball on two feet and came
away with impressions found when
scheming against F SU’s Greg Allen.

“With the kind of running game
they have,” Thompson said of Navy,
“I think they will try to control the
ball against us and keep our offense
off the field.”

When the Pitt offense behind
quarterback John Congemi- ‘does
take the ﬁeld, Navy’s remaining bul-
wark is linebacker Andy Ponseigo.

. The co-captain and All-America is

headed for his third straight season
leading Navy in tackles.
0 Already, hehas 62.

For the Middies, however, not
much more stands out. What can be
expected of a team that relinquishes
20 first downs- a game, surrenders
nearly 200 passing yards every con-
test and gets close to half of its total
offensive yards from one person
(McCallum)?

That's why it is time to start think-

_ ing about pricing some plane tickets.

No major bowl, mind you, but the
possibilities are enticing.

It has not escaped Fazio’s mind, ,

no matter how much he might say
otherwise.

‘ “We’ve told the squad that if they
continue to climb the ladder, con-
tinue to win and continue to
improve‘, [then] those people will
come by," Fazio said. “We have to
prove it onthe field; if so, the indi-
vidual honors and team honors will
come.” '

The honors will continue to flow
tomorrow against the United States

OT Upends Boaters‘

_By TIM DINGER

The Pitt soccer team saw its
record drop below the .500 mark as
Carnegie-Mellon squeaked past the
Panthers 3-2-on Wednesday at. Pitt
Stadium. .

Pitt led throughout most of the
match but gave up a crucial goal
with under four minutes to playto
send the game into overtime.

. “We scored first and held on for a
long time,” Pitt head coach Leo
Bemis said. “We thought we could

hold out, but they fought back and

beat us. 

“We knew it was going to be a
close game that was going to be
decided by one goal, and I had

hoped that we were going to be the

ones on top in the end, but they had
a very strong defense and they beat
us in speed. .

“We gave up all three of their
goals in restarts, which we have to
work hard to overcome." .

The Panthers took a 1-0 lead into
halftime ‘on a goal by sophomore
Rich Burkholder ——_ his third of the
year. i

 

CMU tied it upat one apiece early

in the second half on a goal from -A I
— Charles Lockhead. " '
Pitt went ahead by one again _

when freshman Rich Godfrey came
into the game to scoreehis fourth
..goal of the year. A Panther victory
seemed inevitable until CMU‘s Ted
Anderer scored with minutes left in
the match to knot the score at 2-2.

“They have a very strong kicker in
Neal Frank," Bemis said. ‘‘It -was
him who did it to us in the end.”

Frank, CMU‘s captain, scored the
final goal-in OT.

“They beat us in two areas,”
Bemis continued. “They were faster
than us and they out-hit us. When
you give up two things like that and

you don’t work the ball very much,

you know you're going to lose, but-
we gave it our best shot.” ~

Bemis believes that the problems I

with the team center around its scor-

ing drive. .
“We have 10 men who scored two

or more goals,” he said. “We don't

have a single man we can say is our .

scoring leader. We have to get some-

Hill Shows The Way

By CHARLIE O'HARA

Scan any roster of this year’s edi-
tion of the Pitt football team, and
the same conclusion can be reached:
up and down the line there appear
seven seniors. '

It is a startling fact, considering
head coach Foge Fazio saw 14 from
last year hit the graduation trail. It
may also be unsettling in that leader-
ship may not abound as it did last
year. ‘

However, if the Pitt football team
had to look to one individual for
leadership in any context, it would
need to look no farther than senior
cornerback Troy Hill. Not only is he
a bonaﬁde candidate in that sense,
he also won any election tests
thrown his way after a bang-bang‘
performance last year against North
Carolina. He’s that solid.

“He’s a great motivator,” Pitt

secondary coach Dino Folino said.

“Troy is very enthusiastic, and it’s
contagious.

“He’s a helluva cover guy — an
excellent man-to-man coverage
back. He leads by example in addi-
tion to exciting "personality. He
plays the hot spot, the left corner.
Most teams are right handed, and

» they throw to the left side.”

Throughout the season, Hill, one
of the tri-captains along with fellow
seniors center Jim Sweeney and
safety Tom Flynn, has provided the
team with an enthusiastic attitude
that exemplifies the Panthers’ wide-
open style of play.

“We can do just about anything
that a defense can do,” Hill said.
“We have good guys at every posi-
tion. We have the confidence to
depend on anybody in any defensive
set.”

The Pitt defense — and the entire
team, for that matter — have been
calling on Hill to produce in big
situations since he took over the left
cornerback spot in the 1982 season
opener with UNC’s Tar Heels.

In that game, one which probably
showcased his best performance,
Hill made nine tackles, including
eight unassisted stops, and broke up
two passes. ..

He finished the ’82 season as the
second leading tackler with 61 stops.
(39 solos, 22 assists). He was team
leader in broken—up passes (14) and
interceptions (3), while he also re-
covered two fumbles.

Currently Hill is fifth on the
scrappy Panther defense in tackles
with 46 (26 solos, 20 assists).

He has two interceptions, tying
him with Caesar Aldisert for the
team lead, in addition to having
broken up six possible pass, plays.-

“It’s a lot different this season,” .

Hill said. “I think I’m playing pretty
well, though.

“It’s rewarding to know that the
guys around you believe in you.
Being picked as a tri-captain was a
dream come true. There arera lot of
guys who would love to be captain
for a nationally-known team like
Pitt. '

“Talking is my game, but leading

by example means a great deal also.”

Judging from past experience, his

example will be one to follow when

the Panthers travel to Annapolis to
face Navy.

“They are a well-disciplined foot-
ball team,” Hill said. “It’s also their
homecoming. It’s going to be tough.
For the defense, we have our work
cut out for us. Their tailback [Napo-

leon McCallum] is great. He’s the
main guy in their offense. .

“They have good receivers. Their,

quarterback is pretty good, and he
takes a lot of chances.”

' The ‘Midshipmen reveal an added
dimension in the way they handle

.. defensive back Eric Wallace,
_ "1ney’ll take him from the defen-
sive back position and switch him to
I wide receiver,” Hill said. “He’s—quite

After Navy, Hill plans on being a
part _ of 3a team that wins the
remainder of its games and then goes
on to play in a credible post-season
bowl. ,

“Some team that is smart will take

start forsomebody.” ,,

By all indications, Troy Hil1’s

Do penguins dwell at the North

Pole or the.Sou.th Pole? Whichever

the case may be, the arctic birds are
often shown in National Geogaphic
films sliding across the ice on their
bellies, apparently oblivious to the
rest of the world’s struggles and
schemes. ' .

Here at Pitt, we are fortunate to
have our own version of belly-sliders
to observe. They are less ranbunc-
tious, perhaps, but certainly have a
similar technique. Instead of

appearing in tuxedos, however, this
species dons socks, sweats, and foam
padding.

Most of the student body don’t
realize how much time these individ-
uals spend “frolicking” on the waxed
ﬂoor of their natural habitat, the
gymnasium of Trees Hall.

The individuals referred to are
members of the women’s volleyball
team. The only time these players
are not diving and sliding all over the
court to dig up killer spikes, serve
aces and practice other hits difficult
to return is when they are practicing
the serve. Thus the besocked hands
and padded hips and elbows.

The spikers have this weekend off.
but that does not necessarily indi-
cate light practices. Coach Shelton
Collier places a great deal of empha-
sis on not letting the ball hit the floor
on Pitt’s side of ‘the court, instruct-
ing his players to “scoop” the ball.

This fact should be obvious to
anyone who has witnessed these ath-
letes in action. Anytime the ball does
hit the floor on Pitt’s half, there are
generally three bodies diving after it

and hitting the floor. “Scooping” is’
an important aspect of Collier’s vol-
leyball strategy, but it is also intrin-
sic to another part of the coach’s
scheme. » T 
Confidence in his squad’s ability
to return — in no uncertain terms --
anything that crosses the net, ena-
bles the coach to utilize a
questionable tactic. Serving for_the
ace, the no-deposit-no-return sure--

shot, often means misﬁring into the ‘

net or out of bounds.
The service ace is intimidating,

and puts the opposing- team at an ‘

immediate disadvantage. Collier

concedes that there is a trade-off,‘

but it is a trade that works for his
team. , .

“We miss serves, but if we serve
strategically — for aces —. we win,”
Collier said. “If we’re not putting
some in the net, we’re not being
aggressive enough.”

That effectiveness was evident
Tuesday night when the Panthers
defeated West Virginia in .»four
games, at dim and drafty Trees Hall,

raising their record to 23-6. The

team appeared to have resolved at
least some of the uncertainty gener-
ated by inconsistent.performances
that led to third-place finish last
week at Pitt’s invitational.

A break in the action may be just
what the spikers need to recuperate
physically and mentally, and put the
charge back in their game.

How well the team has resolved its
conflicts will be seen next weekend
when Pitt travels south for the Ten-
nessee Classic. It is hoped the spikers
will dive into it with the assertiveness
they are capable of displaying, and
“scoop” victory from their foes. _

A number of NBA draft choices
_have agreed to terms set by their
teams. Rodney

McCray, the third pick in this year’s
draft, got a four-year contract from
the Houston Rockets. The deal
reportedly is worth $350,000 for the
' first season. Notre Dame guard
John Paxson signed with the San
Antonio Spurs, and Ennis Whatley
of Alabama ended his holdout by
signinga four-year deal worth about
$800,000 with the Chicago -Bulls.

he is close to signing a three-year
contract extension.

player Leslie Berck finished second
to Georgetown’s Suzanne Kuhlman
last year. .

With Kuhlman’s graduation,
Berck should make a-run at the indi-
vidual championship.

Georgetown was the only school
to prevent a sweep by the Orange-

ﬁwomen last year with Kuhlman win-

ning the singles and pairing with
Bridgid McCarthy to win the first

At first, Flores said he was stick-

A Los Angeles Times report said
the California Angels have reached

. an agreement in principle with third-

baseman Doug DeCinces. The
report said an announcement on the
multi-year deal will soon follow.
“We had a very productive meet-
ing Tuesday,” said Ron Shapiro,
DeCinces’ agent, “and it appears
unlikely we’ll be filing for free
agency.” T
DeCinces hit 30 home runs, drove
in 97 runs and batted .301 in 1982
and was on the way to another fine

season when he suffered a rib sepa-
ration in June. It led to muscle
spasms in his lower back and almost
six weeks on the sidelines.»

"l'his year, DeCinces, 33, played in
95 games, was third on the club in
home runs (l8) and second in RBIs
(65)- ‘ . 4 » '

While on the subject of free
agents, 24 players currently intend
to soon test baseball’s market. The
list includes Yankee bullpen ace
