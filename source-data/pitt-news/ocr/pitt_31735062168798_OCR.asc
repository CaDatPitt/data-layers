UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

by ROBERT ZAVOS

Prof. Zalmon Schacter, a
Chassidic Rabbi who is a

member of the faculty at the A

University of Manitoba, be-
lieves that Marshall McLu-

han has made a signiﬁcant
contribution to contemporary
theology.

McLuhan is noted for his book
Understanding Media in which
he proclaims “the medium is the
message.” In short, he means a
new environment has been cre--
ated in which “the content” of
an idea may be less important
than “the medium?’ used to con-
vey the idea.

McLuhan believes there are
basically two types of media:
hot and cold media. Cool media
are those in which the partici-
pant must involve himself to a
high degree, while hot media re-
quire little effort. He considers
radio to be a hot media, while
television is a cool media. Hot
media are those with high deﬁ-
nition, i.e. a lot of information,
while c'ool media have a low deﬁ-
nition and the participant must
supply most 'of the information
himself.

Rabbi Schacter suggested that
19th century theologians used the
hot medium extensively. -A ser-
mon is a hot medium because the

is not supposed to think about it.

On the other hand, the cool
media invites you to question
what is stated. Rabbi Schacter
believes this is dangerous to clas-
sical religion. Furthermore he be-
lieves‘ this is an irreversible pro-
cess. That is, people will continue
to question classical religion as
they are now doing in the so-

Friday Theater

called radical theologies.

ZALMON son-Acmu
Chassidic Rabbi

Rabbi Schacter believes dog-
matists won't like McLuhan. He
thinks the theologian of the fu-
ture is not one who can state,
once and for all, _the ‘meaning of
God and man, but he is the one
who will have his followers think
it out for themselves. He also
said that religious leaders may
not realize this ‘for some time.

NEW YORK, N. Y. (IP)—There
may have been a dramatic shift
in the reading habits of college-
bound youth during the past sev-
eral years, according to the re-
sults of a study at Columbia Col-
lege recently released. 0

The report reveals a trend

. away from the classics, British
writers, and those magazines with
_ . , light content, to existentialists
 like Camus and‘Dostoevsky,
 American writers like Steinbeck,
- Hemingway, Faulkner, and Ayn
Rand, and more serious maga-
‘zines like The New Republic,
Newsweek, Saturday Review and
The New Yorker. ’
The ﬁndings comefrom a com-
parison of books, magazines, and
newspapers read by entering
freshmen in the Class of 1962
and the Class of 1970 at Columbia
College. All applicants to the
college are requested to list the
books they have most enjoyed
_ and the magazines and newspa-
pers they read regularly.
Shakespeare is the author who
[has declined in popularity most
conspicuously. While 25 per cent
' of the Class of 1962 listed at least
one of his plays as a favorite,
. only nine per cent of the 700-
., man Class of 1970 did so.
On the other hand, several au-
V thors have risen sharply in pop-
_ ularity. Camus, listed- as a fav-
 orite by‘ only two per cent of
the Class of 1962, was enjoyed
iby 18 per cent of the Class of
51970. James Joyce was read by
ilﬁﬁve -times as many members of
the Class of 1970 as in the earlier
group. Kafka, Steinbeck, Ayn
‘Rand, Fitzgerald, and Faulkner
were others whose stock has
risen.
,3 ‘Certain single books also con-
tinue to enjoy the students’ fav-
or; Hux1ey’s Brave New World,
..Ioyce’s Portrait of the Artist as
A 1} Young Man, Salinger’s Catcher
 the Rye, Oi'we1l’s 1948 and.

 Existentialist Writers

  Read by College Youth

Animal Farm, Fitzgerald’s The
Great Gatsby.

In magazines, the study re-
veals a movement away from
lighter reading toward periodic-
als more concerned with weighti-
er matters. Reader's Digest was
read by 29 per cent of the Class
of 1962, but only six per cent of
the Class of 1970. Over the eight-
year span The New Republic had
the greatest jump in student sub-
scriptions, from two per cent to
15 per cent Playboy was included
in the regularly-read category by
only a tiny handful.

Ken Frederick and Tom Meisner emerged victorious last night after
one of the most hard fought and publicized campaigns in the history of the
University’s Student Government. By the end of the two weeks of elec-
 tioneering, few people would attempt to predict who the winner would be,

but all agreed the results would be close.

Fortunately the election turnout was a large one with students from
all the schools voting. No one will be able to claim that the results rep1'e-
_ sented a vocal minority or were just the reflection of one school of the

University. With over 3000 students casting their ballots it is

the student will was heard.

It was often remarked during the campaign that there were points on
which the two party proposals converged. One of these ideas was the princi-
ple that students should have a Voice in formulating decisions which affect
their life at the University. We feel that great strides have been made in
the past year toward achieving the goal of student involvement in the deci-
sion making process. This has come as a result of students researching
problems and the presenting rational solutions to the administration.

We must in the next year continue to build upon the progress that
has been made. Frederick and Meisner come to their position eminently

’  Attacks Editorial

.”_ Editor, The Pitt News:

On January 6, 1967, The Pitt
News published an editorial, en-
titled “ACLU’S Bad Advice,” in
which the anonymous author at-
tempted to attack a letter circu-
lated by the ACLU to 1,000 col-
lege and university presidents
throughout the United States.
The letter urged them to resist
subpoenas by the House Commit-

tee on ‘Un-American Activities
for membership lists of campus
organizations critical of U.S. poli-
cy in Vietnam. I use the word
“attempt” because it is immedi-
ately apparent that the author
was not familiar with the con-
tents of the letter, though it was
published, in part, in The Pitt

News during the latter part of_

1966.

that the ACLU l.etter did not ask

poena in the courts, the subpoena
would be held invalid. '

In 1958, the U..S. Supreme Court
upheld the NAACP’s refusal to

I submit to a court ‘order requir-

ing production of its member-
ship lists. In its decision (NAACP
v. Alabama) the Court stated:

' “Inviolabi1ity of privacy in group

association may in many circum-
stances be indispensible to pres-
ervation of freedom of associa-
tion, particularly where a group
espouses dissident beliefs
'(T)he production order . . . must
be regarded as entailing the like-
lihood of a substantial restraint
upon the exercise by petitioner's
members of their right to free-
dom of association. . . . It is be-
yond debate that freedom to en-
gage in association for the ad-
vancement of beliefs and ideas
is an inseparable aspect of the
‘liberty’ assured by the Due Pro-
cess Claus of the 14th Amend-
ment, which embraces freedom
of speech.”

The ACLU letter pointed out
that if campus membership lists
were submitted unquestioningly
to l-IUAC, students whose names
were on such lists would risk
“future inquisitions at the hands
of the Committee,” which was

asserting the “intimidating pow-'

er of an official investigating
body armed with compulsory
process.” It is hard to avoid the
compelling conclusion that
HUAC’s behavior represents one
of the most serious breaches of
academic freedom to date.

had common goals, the victors as well as the defeated must forget the bit-
terness of past days. Perhaps this is an idyllic statement, but it is a reflec-
tion of what is now so desperately needed.

It has often been said that university administrations relished dis-
agreements between student leaders. These differences produce a situation
where the campus groups can never find points of agreement so the admin-
istration receives no well articulated opinion on major problems.

Ultimately the real test of the devotion of the candidates to the ideals
upon which they campaigned is whether they are willing to work with their
former opponents for the implementation of their shared ideas. We urge‘
all those who stated their interest in Student Government to stand behind
Frederick and Meisner so that it will be one student body speaking to the
University community. ‘It is not an easy goal to accomplish, but it is essen-

tial to achievement of all that it is necessary for the continued growth of
a great university. '

It is hoped by this writer that
the author of the editorial was
mistaken in equating the asser-
tion of constitutionally protected
rights with an an act of civil
disobedience. ‘

ACLU does not urge that mem-
bership lists“ should not be sub-
mitted under any circumstances,
but. that they “should not, with-
out the consent of the individuals
involved, be disclosed to any . . .
person having no direct and legi-
timate interest therein.”

EDITOR’S NOTE: The editorial
in question was not written by
an “anonymous author” but
rather by the editor-in-chief. As
is stated in the Editorial Policy
which is continuously published

in this newspaper, the editor-in- -

chief is the author of all editori-
als unless they are otherwise
initialed.

Further, we are aware that
the ACLU has testified before
Congress on HUAC’s activities.
But we still hold to our position

that the administration of a Uni- '0

versity should not become em-
broiled in a battle which has def-
inite political overtones. The Uni-
versity’s duty is to imbue its stu-
dents with certain values and
hope to affect the governmental
structure by producing well-ed-
ucated citizens. However, the Uni-
versity should-not participate in
an active challenge of this struc-
ture.

Students WantNon-Military

Involuntary Service Draft

Nearly eight out of ten teen-
agers in American high schools
favor the United States adopting
a National Service Program un-
der which they would be drafted
for involuntary service in non-
military activities, according to a
recent nation-wide -. poll among
junior and senior high school
students conducted by Scholastic
magazines.

Seventy-seven per cent of all
students polled favor such invol-
untary service. Of the total num-
ber of boys polled, 56 per cent
said they would still prefer mili-
tary service; less than a quarter
(23 per cent) said they would
choose non-rnilitary activities
(such as the Peace Corps, Med-
ical Corps, VISTA, Job Corps or

related programs) if available;
and 18 per_ cent were undecided.

Involuntary service for women
was favored by 46,per cent, or

almost half of the high school _

girl students queried in the poll.

The poll, taken by the Insti-
tute of Student Opinion of the
Scholastic Research Center, New
York, involved in-depth question-

naires returned by a scientiﬁcal- V

ly selected sampling of 2,539 jun-
ior and senior high school stu-
dents in public, private and paro-
chial school- systems across the
nation.

‘VPI Wins, 77-609
iCagers Lose Again; 
 MeetBucknellNeX‘t

By JAY ROSENSTEIN, Assistant Sports Editor

9 The Pantherg basketball team has lost four games since
the win over Lafayette two weeks ago. Bucknell, off for

I ‘ exams, hasn’t played a game in that time. The two teams

“-face each other tomorrow night at 8 :15 in the Field House.
The 5-5 Bisons are led by Mott McMonigle, a 6’-6” for-

ward averaging 16 points a game. "‘They’re better than
Lafayette,” said Panther coach Bob Timmons, “but they’re

‘oi the eager ledger to 3-12 Mon-
day night by surging in the last
ten minutes to a 77-60 win. The
cagers trailed only 47-44 with

- "only 9:40 remaining, primari1}l\'

because of Ken Bollens’ hot
shooting hand. Bollens came off

. the bench early in the game to
hit; for 28 of the 44 points scored
up to that time.

-' But then Virginia Tech’s press
and fast break contributed nine
straight points to make the score
56-44 and the Panthers couldn't

 get close after that. -

“We have to learn to hang in
there and stay tough for the
I whole ball game,” complained a

 chagrined Timmons afterwards.

_‘fJust nine more minutes of hus-

L tle would have done it.”

VPI coach Howie Shannon cred-

_"'ited the cagers with controlling

most of the game. “We were on

I - defense 75 per cent of the time,”
—- he said. ' .

The Panthers’ zone caused most

.. of Tech’s problems. Timmons ex-
,_ 7 plained that since VPI liked to
;,_.play a fast game, the zone forced

them to take bad shots. Its full

“effect wasn't apparent, however,

until some of the first half had
gone by.

‘ Led by Ron Perry, the Gobblers
jumped off to a 12-1 advantage
and the game appeared to be a
run-away. “But once they start-
ed to miss from outside,” noted
Timmons, “we began getting the
rebounds. ‘We lost the control of

I’-the backboards in the second

half.”

Perry scored 19 points for the
_~=visitors, second high to Glen
‘Combs who had 20. Ted Ware
and Keh Talley each tallied 14,
mostly on shots from inside. Bol-
lens’ 28 points represented his
‘career high. The only other eager
in double ﬁgures was Pete Smith
‘with 14. - 

I I “Bollens gave us a great game,”
praised Timmons. At the same
ftime, he expressed disappoint-
-inent over the play of his three

IS BUSINESS STRUCTURED  
FOR RECOGNITION  
OF INDIVIDUAL MERIT '2  

Robert W. Galvin

Dear Mr. Byman:

The fundamental concern expressed in the headline
above has been voiced in one way or another by all
six students taking part in our current exchange of
views on business. Because it is an issue of such
common concern, I am going to respond in the same
manner to each of you.

_We would agree, I believe, that there are instances

in which seniority, prejudice in some form, nepotism,
or personal chemistry have been influential to an I
unjustifiable degree in advancing or hindering
careers in business, in government, in education. This
shows human frailty; it is neither unique nor
dominant in business. We must combat this for

the gener-alimprovement of society and we will be
assisted in our task by the fact that inadequacy in

any position of leadership tends to catch up with

its owner.

‘ Meanwhile, the great burden of evidence supports

a conviction that business is structured for the
recognition of individual merit.

lg There are thousands of. executives in American

business today who made their mark before they

; were 50. Many before 40. I want to tell you about one
‘of these men, not because I seek togeneralize on

I :one specific but because theindividual merit which

-V has been demonstrated in his career broadly

characterizes American business leadership.

'_ This man's career might be entitled ”How To Succeed
‘Quickly in Business by Shuffling Letters.” It is not a
I tale of a young genius who invented a new product
. and zoomed to the high tax brackets overnight.
' There are true stories like that, but they don't speak
‘ » directly to your questions.

g No, this story starts with an 18-year-old student of
' humble circumstances at the University of Chicago

who had an ordinary summerjob at a camera

‘if company. His job wasn't too different from the sort

of summer job which manycollege students would

ﬂ  describe as dull and boring, fragmented and incon-
" f»,~jgclusive., He worked in the company's service
‘ ' department. He answered complaint letters.

 

It was a small department (there weren't too many
complaints) and the college student spent about two
weeks doing exactly what he was paid to do: read
letters, find the problem, write answers which gave
the solution. This is the way the job had always been
done, no matter who sat at that particular desk.
Gradually, however, this particular answer—writerV
(his name was Charles H. Percy—the company was
Bell & Howell) beganto see patterns emerging in the
customers’ letters. With few exceptions, he realized,
each letter fell into one of perhaps nine categories.

Percy took a bundle of letters home that weekend,
sorted them out on the floor, and began to compose
a group of specific‘, carefully thought-out letters of
reply. He checked and rechecked each letter against

each proposed answer letter and against all the other ‘ .

answer letters. He found that, sure enough, he now
had created a series of answers which gave full

and courteous reply to almost every customer letter
in the bundle.

On Monday morning, Percy checked the morning-
mail against his new letters and, when‘ they, too,
checked out, he took the whole bundle into the
service department manager's ‘office.

The service manager heard Percy out, checked the
letters in the bundle, and agreed: a secretary could

sort incoming complaints by category, type the
answers, and forward a copy for further action where

needed. The manager also agreed that Percy had
knowingly eliminated his own job.

This intrigued Percy's boss (jobs were scarcer than
they are today) and he told Bell & Howell President
Joseph H. McNabb about "this enterprising kid
down there who has wo_rked himself out of a job.”
Mr. McNabb said, ”That’s a young man we should
keep an eye on.”

Chuck Percy went to work full—time for Bell & Howell '

after he graduated in 1941. He was elected president
and chief executive officer at 29. The company's sales
increased twelvefold under his leadership. Today,

at 47, he is a newly elected United States senator.
Counting his summer jobs, he had worked for Bell

& Howell for 28 years. ‘

Robert Byman

I do not contend that every college student can
duplicate the Percy story in whatever career he
chooses. I do submit, however, that your own
version of this story will start when you start to
apply your individual creativity to your first job the
way he did to his. _ I
Answering complain-t letters can be a routine job for

a routine sort of fellow. Come at the job with
creativity, however, and you can lift it from the

.humdrum. You can even eliminate the job—and there

aren't many more forceful ways to show that you are
ready for a bigger job than to eliminate your
present one.

Note also that here was a man who achieved job
fulfillment, recognition,.security, advancement,
individuality, a chance for creativity—all the things
today's college students want from their working
Iives—and he achieved them all within the business
structure.

Society itself has a structure. All elements within
society have structures. These structures generally
work for the good of the individual, not for his harm
—and the degree to_which this, is so depends in the
final measure largely upon the individual.

Chuck Percy did not wait for chance recognition——
he earned his early recognition by his own creative
vision, imagination, and action.

The fastest route to a job of major responsibility is to V

improve the handling of a job of lesser responsibility.

This two-way conversation
is open to you

Have you questions or opinions about business as
a possible career or as a force in society? Have‘ you
reactions (pro or con) to this series of open letters
between Bob Byman, a student at University of
Illinois, and Robert W. Galvin, chairman of
Motorola lnc.? Letters like this one have appeared
regularly in 29 student newspapers throughout the
country since October. You are invited to make
your feelings known, to_o. Write Mr. Galvin at
