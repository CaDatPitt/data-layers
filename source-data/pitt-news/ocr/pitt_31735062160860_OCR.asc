Poetess, Editor To Talk

At Concluding Session

  Of Writers’ F

Conference

. The last day of the Conference for Readers and Writers

will feature Sara Henderson Hay and Elliot Schryver to-

morrow morning at Stephen Foster Memorial.

Miss Hay, a local poetess and reviewer, will speak at 9
am. tomorrow on “The Importance of Being, Interested” in

Stephen Foster Memorial.

Schryver, the editor of Putnam’s¢
Sons, will follow at 10 am. with

Miss Hay was born in Pitts-
burgh but spent most of her
early years in Alabama. Her
ﬁrst poems were published
when she was ten.

H_er first book of poems, Field
of_Honor, won the Kaleidograph
Award in 1933.

For seven years she worked in
the rare book department of
Charles Scribner’s Sons. At that
time she began to review
poetry and ﬁction for the Saturday
Review and "other periodicals, an
occupation she still pursues.g

In« 1939 her second book of
poems, This, My Letter,’ was pub-
published.

Her poems have been pub-
lished individually in almost all
the major magazines. They ap-
pear in a number of anthologies
and in high school and college

text books, including Louis
Unte_rmeyer’s “D o‘o r w a y to
Poetry."

She gives many poetry readings
over the air and from the lecture
platform. She has appeared on a
number of television shows.

In the spring of 1951 her third
volume of verse, “The Delicate
Balance,” was published. It re-
ceived the Edna St: Vincent Mil-
lay Award given by the Poetry
Society of America .for “an out-
standing book published in 1951.”

In 1955, ‘in recognition of her
contribution to the ﬁeld of
literature, Miss, Hay was named
Pittsburgh’s Literary Figure of
the Year, an award sponsored
by the Junior Chamber of Com-

_ merce. A T

'_ Elliot Schryver’s literary career
‘began as a proofreader at the Vik-
ing Press two years after gradu_a-
tion from the University of Chi-
cago. Among his earliest jobs was
the editing of The Grapes ‘of
Wrath by John Steinbeck. .

For ten years he was with the
“Woman's Home Companion” as
ﬁction editor and book serializa-
tion editor. He is now senior edi-
tor at G. P. Putnam’s.

For Assemblies

of SUB dealingiwith assemblies.
It is the intention of the amend-

ment that any assembly program

deemed unworthy by the Cultural

necessary funds.

In stating the motion, Lois'

r Capin, Col. 61, indicated that the
interpretation . of “assemblies”
would exclude larger programs
involving high ﬁnances.

Speaking against the motion,
Public Relations Chairman Jim
Finnegan, Col. ’60, noted, “To
delegate responsibility to another
organization will detract from the
programming of SGA to whom the
credit rightfully belongs.”

In retort Ann Papieski, Ed. ’59
commented, “It is important to re-
member that SGA is primarily a
governing body while SUB» as-
sumes responsibility in the recrea-
tion ﬁeld.”

SGA voted to accept a motion
by Dave Breakstone, Col. ’60,
calling for SGA to investigate
and implement the adoption of
a new seal and key for itself.

For the third consecutive week
President Bert O’Malley, Col. ’59,
reported thatno reply was forth-
coming from Dr. William Boyer,
Chairman of the Subcommittee on
Student Government concerning
an interpretation of a constitu-
tional section in question.

It was passed that the SGA re-
treat be re-scheduled Sept. 19

Danforth Foundation Awards
Grant   or Religion

Will Provide

F or One Year

By MILLARD ANIDUR
The University of Pitts-
burgh has received a grant of
$4,000 from the Danforth
Foundation to support a one-

year program of spiritual
emphasis.

The Board of Religion sponsor-
ed the proposal to the Danforth
Foundation. Dr. Prentiss L. Pem-
berton of the Danforth Founda-
tion came to the campus recently
for discussion of the University's
proposed implementation of the
program. .

With the grant, the University
will provide four two-day meet-
ings for students. Outstanding"
spokesmen for the four religious
faiths will be represented. Each
program will be devoted to a.
single major faith.

The first of these programs, held
April 22 and 23, was devoted to
the Catholic faith.

A monthly lecture and seminar
in religion, featuring faculty from
this and other Universities, is an-
other feature of the program. This
series would not stress the theo-
logical approach, but rather the
scholarly. A '

A loan library of articles and
books written or recommended
by the speakers will be available
in the chgiplainls office.

' Administrative-faculty semi-
nars on religion in higher edu-
cation will be held as well as an
evaluation and planning confer-
ence for Student Council of Re-
ligious Organizations.

Richard Mattern, past president
of SCRO, believes that “through
the generosity of the Danforth
Foundation, Pitt will be able to
proceed with its unique program
on intcr—religious faith and thus
present to the University com-
munity a year—round spiritual em-
phasisf’

Richard Zionts, ncwly—elected
president of SCRO has stated,
“This is the opportunity we had
hoped to get. It will prove a ter-
riﬁc boon to the Student Council
of Religious Organizations and to
the University religious program
in general.”

Newsman Tells of Communist. Home State

Says Caste Idea,
Like Segregation,
Is Dying Slowly

By ROSALIE GLAND

As a part of his two-month tour
of colleges and universities in the
United States, K. Krishnam of
Kerala, India, enjoyed a three-day
stopover in Pittsburgh.

The tour, the purpose of which
is to compare American educa-
tgional institutions with those in
India, is sponsored by the U.S.
“Exchange Leaders Program.”

Krishnam is the editor of the
newspaper in Trichur, a city in the
state of Kerala.

Kerala, one of 14 states in In-
dia, is located in the southern-
.most part of India. Chieﬂy an
agricultural area, it is the small-
est but most densely populated
state. A

Proudly, he pointed out that
Kerala is the most advanced state
edl”lcationally—-50 per cent of its
women are educated—-and has the
greatest percentage of Christian
population.

Notes Differences

His newspaper, the “Express,’_’ is
published seven days a week and
‘has a circulation of about 21,000.

He noted that the chief differ-
ence between Indian and Amer-
ican newspapers is the quantity
and cost of advertising. “There
is very little advertising in our
newspapers c o m p a r e d with
American newspapers.

The “Express” is the third larg-
est paper in India.‘ It receives 50
per cent of its revenue from ad-
vertising; the remainder from
sales. Each issue sells for the
equivalent of one penny in Amer-
ican currency.

Talks About Schools
V There are 34 universities in In-
dia located in the metropolitan
- ities_. Each has aﬁ‘iliated‘col1eges,
"‘=‘somewhat on the order of our own
Johnstown Center. T-h ey are
ﬁnanced by the government, al-
though there are some private in-
stitutions.

The Indian university term

V extends from July to April be-

‘ cause the rest of the year is ex-
tremely hot and not conducive to
learning. Anyone may attend
the universities provided he
meets the requirements and has
the money.

Examinations are held once a
year in April. They are similar to
our departmental exams. “Every-
one takes the same one."

. Castes Still Exist
$3’ Concerning education generally,
Krishnam remarked that each In-
dian child receives eleven years
of education beginning at the age
of six. “This is compulsory,” he
stated.
“The fact that persons can re-
ceive higher education only if
they have the necessary money

is an indication that the caste
system still exists,” he admitted.
However, he pointed out that the
system is gradually breaking
down. “There is now intermarriage
among the more educated people.”
Government Tries
The government of India‘, in try-
ing to solve the caste problem,
does provide free university edu-
cation for the “untouchables.”

He compared the casteisitua-
tion with our own civil rights
problem. ‘_‘It is a class problem,
rather than a caste problem,” he
added.

During his

Pittsburgh Stay,

Krishnam resided at the Webster 1

Hall Hotel. He enjoyed Pittsburgh

very much. “It is a very impressive
city,” he commented. “The cost of
living is very high, however-even
higher than that of Washington,
D.C.”
Helps India

“I especially wanted to visit
Pittsburgh because ‘it is helping
my country in a very big way.”
He was referring to the fact that
many of his countrymen are being
trained as engineers at Carnegie
Tech.
S In addition to his position of

editor of the “EXPRESS, ”Krish-

nam is the president of the town
library. For this reason he was
very anxious to visit Carnegie
Library, which he labelled as
“a very ﬁne institution.”

He was amazed at the number
of people using the library facili-
ties. He conﬁded that the citizens
of his city do not use their libraries
nearly so much.

The Middle East

Krishnam made several com-
ments concerning the world situ-
ation. Of the Arab-Israeli conﬂict
he stated, “I believe that eventu-
ally there will be a complete Arab
Federation.”

“Israel will then be in a very

‘difficult position. The problem
has to be solved by the United
Nations.” ,

His opinion of the Algerian-
French conﬂict was stated briefly,
“Algeria must be given her free-
dom.” L

Interested In Dance

Krishnam also finds time to be
president of Natana Niketanam, a
dancing school in Trichur. All the
students of the school are girls be-
tween the ages of ten and four-
teen.

He was an ‘interested onlooker

More important to Pitt, it ccluld mean that the Police

Letters T0iTl1e Editor

.Editor, The Pitt News,

An article ‘in last week’s Pitt
News indicated that the Vice-
Chancellor for Student _Affairs,
Dr. Charles Peake, “questioned
the right of pressure groups such
as the NAACP to be recognized
by the University.” It was also
indicated that Dr. Peake would
make further investigation of the
question before making a decision.
This is encouraging news.

We hope that in addition to this
further investigation‘ Dr. Peake
will consider the possibility that
cautious conform-ism and apathy
on political and social issues may
constitute a greater danger ,to a

"free and creative intellectual 'at-
mosphere than the controversy
.an undergraduate
“pressure group.”

 We "are writing in the belief.

that a good university need not
fear controversy. ~

The recent leter to the Editor,
by a so-called Roman Catholic
regarding the disharmony and
confusion the Roman Catholic so-
ciety causes on campus is a sure
sign *‘ some misinformed person’s
complete ignorance.

A good Catholic has no reason
to participate in an inter-faith
discussion. We have only one
view point, and that _i‘s‘our relig-
ion. lWe respect other religions
and their beliefs, but -haveno
reason to discuss their viewpoints.

  

I know nothing of the local
Catholic Club, but if they are as
narrow-minded as this babbling-

Roman Catholic says they are;'<é

they should use more suitable

- tactics.

Then again, if they are being
spoken of in an untrue manner,
I hope they answer this letter

wisely. It has always amazed me .3

how closely we Catholics
watched, but the good is never
published, or spoken of-—only th
bad. »

its good name, I am sure that is

THE ENGINEERS HAVE HAIRY EARS’,

Today in this age of technology when engineering grziduatcs are
woocd and courted by all of Amcrica’s great industries, how do
you account for the fact that Rimbhud Siguf’oos, who ﬁnished
at the very top of his class at M ._I.T., tu1'nq,’l down lmmlrcds of
attract-ive job offers to accept employment as a machinery
wiper at the Acme Ice Company at a salary of .‘ll‘.20 a week with
a twelve—hour day, a seven-day week, and only ﬁfteen "minutes
for lunch?

.1;-tau

I I know wlmt you are thinking: "C720-rc?l7ez la fcmmc!" You are
thinking that Mr. Acme, head of the Acme Ice COIll}):,lll_‘)', has
a beautil’ul d:u1g'hter with whom Rimbaud is madly in love and

he took the job only to be near her.

Friends, you are wrong. It is true tlmt Mr. Acme does have

' a daugliter, a large, torpid lass named (‘lavdia who spcmls all

her waking hours scooping mar’/.ip:in out of a bucket and .<t:i.ring
at a television set which has not worked in some years. Rim-
baud has not the slightest interest in (‘elzivdia ; nor, imlccd, does
any other man, excepting possibly John Ringling North.

So how come Rimbaud keeps working for the Acme I cc Com-
pany? Can it be that they provide him with free M:-irlboro
Cgarettcs, and all day long he enjoys that ﬁlter, that flavor,
that Hip-top box? . - ' .

No, friends, no. Rimbaud is not allowed to smoke on the job,
and when he finishes his long, miserable day, he has to buy his
own Marlboros, even as you and I, in order  enjoy that
cstunalile ﬁlter, that incomparable flavor, that crazy ﬂip-top box.

Well, friends, on mi ht as well ive in because rou’ll never
g g P 3

‘ in a million years guess why Rimbaud works for the Acme Ice

Company. The :'ea§on is simply this: Rimbaud is a seal!

He started as a performing seal in vaudeville. One night on
the way to the Ed Sullivan show, he took the wrong subway.
All night the poor mammal rode the B.M.T., seeking a helping
hand. '"“1*‘inally a kindly brakcman named Ernest Thompson
Sigafoos rescued the hapless Rimbaud.

He took Rimbaud home and raised him as his own, and
.Rimb:iud, to show his a.ppreciat.ion, studied hard and got ex-
cellent marks and finished a distingiiislied academic career as
Valedictorian of l\l.I.T.

Rimbaud never complained to his kindly foster fathei, but
through all those years of grammar school and high school and
co'Ilcgc, he darn near died of the heat! A seal, you must remem-

ber, is by nature a tlciiizen of the Arctic, so you can irnagine'

how poor Rimbaud must have suiiered in subtropical New /York
and Boston, cspc(-iully in those tight Ivy League suits.

But today at the Acme Ice Company,’ Rimbaud has ﬁnally
found a temperature to his liking. He is very happy and sends
greetings to his many friends.

Summer Nears;
Problems Start
For Michelosen

By LARRY HAGGERTY
_Now that spring practice
has ended, John Michelosen’s
job as football coach is just
beginning, “A lot of people

think that there is nothing

else to do until September, but
We must work on every phase of
the game and try to iron out the
problems that arose in the squad
game,” declared Michelosen.

The game that Michelosen re-
ferred to took place at Wildwood
last Saturday. In the encounter, a

Blue team lead by Co—captain Ed
’Michaels trimmed Co-captain Don

Crafton’s White squad by a 29-0
score.

The ﬁrst half was mainly a/
defensive battle until the Blues
took possession of the ball near
midﬁeld with about ﬁve minutes
remaining in the second stanza.

man went untouched into the end-
zone. Toncic. passed to End Ron
the extra point to
make the score 8-0. Conversions

.are worth two points if not place-
kicked this season.

Midway through the third
quarter, the Blues tallied their
second touchdown. Toncic passed
six yards to Delﬁne and place-
kicked the extra 7 :int to make
the score 15-0. The Blues con-
tained the White attack for the
rest of the quarter and then
proceeded to add two more
scores in the ﬁnal period.

Looking foreword to another inte7‘esting season

a lot of good out of the game. The
Blues seemed to get the jump on
the White squad in the second
quarter and held it for the bal-
ance of the game,” announced
Michelosen. I ‘

“I was impressed by the boys
on defense because there were
always three or four players
trying to converge on the area
near the ball carrier. The over-
all team spirit was quite encour-

aging, too. ,

“The squad was a little dub-
ioas as to how the new offensive
patterns would work out, but I
think that nearly a1l"the' boys
were given the chance to carry
out the maneuvers themselves.
The backs that looked exception-
ally good were Riddle and Toncic.

We should have a lot more

i Darling Loses AAU Title

To Ken Cheney, UCLA

Ken Cheney, a UCLA graduate and a former victim of
the Panther’s All-American gymnast, Tom Darling, defeat-
ed the Blue and Gold star on the ﬂying rings to gain the Na-

tional AAU title. Cheney had 9:45 point total in the judging

as compared to Dar1ing’s 9.2 mark.
Darling was attempting to complete his second straight

ﬂying rings grand slam. Last yearO

he-won.the Eastern, NCAA, and
AAU ﬂying ring tourneys. So far
this season Darling had success-
fully defended his Eastern and
NCAA crowns. A I

However, Darling was not
quite as fortunate in the AAU
meet that was held in San Fer-
nando, California. ‘Cheney, a
victim of the Pantherstar in the
National Collegiates‘ in 1956,
was able to dethrone the pride
of Warren Neiger’s gym team.

“This was the best officiated and
worst run tournament that I have
ever took part in. Also. Cheney
beat me by a larger margin than
the score indicated,” announced
Darling after returning home from
the Coast on Monday.

N etters Travel
ToMorgantown

A chance forirevenge will
be given to West Virginia as
the Panther netters travel to
Morgantown this Saturday.
Early in the season the West
Virginia squad‘lost .a tight
team match to the local squad 5-4.

In the Waynesburg game play-
ed last‘Saturday, Bill King and

Don Isaacs remained «unbeaten as

a tennis double by decisioning Jim
Clovis and Doug Mervin, 6-3, 6-2.

The squad took the Waynesburg
match, played at Wildwood, 9-0.
This second match of the season
resulted in an identical score as

‘the first played at Waynesburg.

The Wildwood team now boasts
a 4-1 record, with the loss coming
at the hands of Bucknell.

Darling was handicapped in
that he was not permitted to prac-

tice on the ﬁnal day of the tourna-
ment. “They had the doors locked
all day and wouldn’t let me and
several other gymnasts work out
on the apparatus,” declared
Darling.

“By the worst run tourna-
ment, Tom means that " the
equipment was not up to stand-
ard form,” stated-Neiger. “The
rings that were used in the
ﬁnals had not been, used in ac-
tual competition in ten years.
They were a set of rings that I
would be ashamed of,” con-
tinued the Panther coach

The annual tournament was
won by the Los Angeles German-
Turners. Second and third place

went to USC and UCLA respec- A

tively. Said Cheney, after the
meet, “Tom Darling is the ﬁne'st

The Panthers go to Penn State for their last away dual-
meet of the season this Saturday in an attempt to avenge
last years three point» loss, 67-64.

If last weeks results of both teams are any indication. of
what this meet will be like, Coach Carl Olson will have an-
other close one on his hands. Penn State came from behind

to edge Michigan 63-1/6-—58—5/6°
, while the Jungle Cats were routed

by the Fighting Irish 721/2--581/2.
. Comparing individual records,
The Locals should split "the bill
with the Nittany Lions. Olsons
thinclads should have the edge in
the 100 yard dash, 120 high hur-

’dles, 220, 220 low hurdles, Shot
. put, high jump, and the discus.

The Lions seem to have the
edge in the mile, 440, 880, 2
mile run, mile relay, pole vault,
and broad jump. With both
teams favored in seven events,
the possible tie breaker could

mi urge.

Panther Yearlings
Claim 3-2 Record;
Lose To Shadyside

With the season half over, the
Panther Cub Mitters can only lay
claim to a 3-2 record. The wins
were recorded over Central Cath-
olic,»West Virginia, and 20th Ward
in an exhibition game while the
losses came at the hands of Du-
quesne and Shadyside.

The loss to Shadyside occurred
last Monday after the,Cubs were
ahead 4-3. The Shadyside team,
one of the best high school teams
in the area, put two men on by
errors and two more on through
walks with a double to left center
following to give the young
schoolboys an easy 7-4 victory.

Nick Sutyak picked up the tab
to give him an 0-2 record for the
season. Butch Guthrie is cred-
ited with the three victo-ries.

V Coach Dave Starret’s"onIy prob-

lem with Sutyak is that there
isn’t any catcher on the team
that can catch for Sutyak.
“Sutyak’s ball is a little too
tricky ‘for our catchers but he
should do very well on the varsity
with DeLost catching him,” com-
mented Starret.
The Jungle Cubs have been
depending on a nucleus of ﬁve

men. Ronnie Mazur and Sutyaki

have been hitting at a .450 clip
while Guthrie leads the team with
a .500 average. “ Jerry Metavoiich
is also slugging away'over the
.400 mark.

Pete Suder has turned into . a

‘jack of all trades by handling

three positions—second base, third
base, and catch. Guthrie, besides
leading the hitting ﬁeld is also
sporting the best record for a
pitcher, 3-0.
