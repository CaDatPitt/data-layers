Such obeservers point out that the
State~Legislature has thus far shunned
all "tax "proposals. They especially

doubt that taxes __on insurance premi—_

opposition these have aroused. Fur-
--thermore. they fear that pressure upon

priations measure is passed. regard-

this statement to the members of the
Legislature of the Commonwealth of

in I Pennsylvania and to the public of the

Commonwealth.

We deplore the continuing political
impasse that has so _far prevented the
passage of appropriations for essen-

p tial financial support of the state-re-

lated universities of the Commo-

I if wealth and other institutions. We call

herewith for the enactment of a broad-
based source of revenue that will en-
able the Commonwealth to meet its
obligations.

The situation is grave. In order to
remain in operation. the three state-
related universities. Pittsburgh, Tem-
ple, and Penn State, have been forced
to borrow millions of dollars. If no re-
medial action is taken, their capacity
to borrow funds will soon be exhaust-
ed. It this happens. these institutions
would be unable to continue operation
and the Commonwealth System of

I -Higher Education would be crippled

or would collapse. with incalculably
harmful effects upon the economy, the
intellectual life, and even the political

A stability of the state.

We as Trustees are especially dis-
turbed because failure to provide our
appropriation would constitute a
breach of the mutual understanding
between the Commonwealth and the

University that is the . basis of our"
state-related status. We have admit-
ted many thousands of students who
could not afford to pay tuition at our
previously high levels, with the clear
understanding that the difference was
to be made up by the Commonwealth.
At the same time, in response to the
stated needs of the Commonwealth, we
have reinforced and expanded our pro-
grams of education is costly but criti-
cal areas such as public health, law-
medicine, government, teacher prep-
aration, social work, natural and social
sciences and humanities. We have tail-
ored all these programs to new cri-
teria of public service. We gratefully
acknowledge that/{the university has
long benefited from the financial sup-
port of the'Commonwealth, but we also
point out that since becoming state-re-
lated the University has, with clear ex-
pectation of support, reoriented itself
with great effort to achieve these ex-
panded purposes. ' ’

As Trustees of the University", we.
reject in the firmest terms the notion
that there is any way by which the leg-
islature can escape its responsibility
to act. We refer. in particular, to the
fallacy that by massive economies or
massive tuition increases the univer-
sities themselves could solve this prob-
lem.

As for economies. the Board of
Trustees of the University of Pitts-

burgh supports the continuing _efforts ‘

of its administrators to conserve cur-
rent funds by reducing expenditures
and by tightening internal controls.
However. the basic fact is that the
funds from the Commonwealth, nearly
$40 million, are for a fiscal year that is
approaching its end—for salaries and
programs f'or which most expenditures
have already been made or commited
in good faith.

As for tuition increases, it may be
necessary for the University to make '
some adjustments next year,’ but mas-
sive increases are infeasible.iUnder
our commitment to the Commonwealth
as 'a state-related university, we have
admitted thousands of new students,

Commonwealth this would be a dis-
grace, for it would set a precedent in
the nation for reversing the progress
of higher education.

For all of these reasons. we individ-

the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to

put the public interest ahead of any ,

partisan interest. and to join with their

The Commonwealth’s financial cri-
sis and the University's immediate
monetary woes are apparently near an
end. The General Assembly yesterday
approved a tax package which will pro-
vide sufficient funds for the 1969-70
fiscal year.

Especially important, the State
House an appropriations measure pro-
viding funds for Pitt and other state-
related universities and it appeared
likely‘ that the State Senate would.fol-
low suit, doing the same early next

 ‘week.

The tax package approved by both
legislative chambers included the ex-
tension of the state’s six per cent sales
tax to insurance premiums, a 30 mill

tax on utility property, and a 25 mill -
increase in the gross receipts tax on _

utilities.

The measure was placed on the
Governor’s desk yesterday evening

and is expected to be signed by Gov-
ernor Shafer within ten days. Then. af-
ter 13 months of disagreement, the
State’s financial crisis will formally
end.

Throughout Thursday, the final out-
come of the General Assembly‘s delib-
erations remained uncertain. The tax
on.insurance premiums, which arous-
ed considerable opposition and pro-
voked the wrath of powerful lobbyist.
was approved in the Senate by the bare
margin of three votes. It secured
enough votes for passage in the House
only after suspense had mounted to a
peak. ‘

Actually. the entire afternoon prov-
ed exciting asmany state legislators
put their careers on the line to resolve
the financial -impasse which has
plagued the state for so-long. The House
‘began by appropriating money pre-
viously promised. to Pitt and other
state-relateduniversities. Among those

 

John Lauaauio of the 56th District,
whose prior opposition to the measure
was expressed in Monday's Pitt News,
but who changed his mind and con-
cluded that continuing state support
of Pitt is essential.

Shortly afterwards, the Senate took
a giant step, passing the three bill tax
package which was. later approved by
the House, - ‘

Elated over yesterday's settlement,.

University sources expressed admira-

tion for those legislators who support- .

ed Pitt’s appropriation and the tax
package.

USSC Statement

(Editor's Note: The following is a statement issued by John Cav-
aluc_hy, campaign manager for President-elect Steve Cundra.)

President-elect of Student Government Steve Cundra lobbied in
Harrisburg on Tuesday and Wednesday for the passage of Pitt appro-

priations. Late Wednesday afternoon. he returned to Pittsbrugh to
be installed as the official presidentofstudent Government. Before
he could begin_to get down to work back at Pitt. he was called into
Assistant Chancellor Kobosky’s office. He was told that charges
were leveled against him and that the election was again to be held
in abeyance. These charges centered around the over expenditure of
money by the United Student Coalition Party. These were the same
expenditures that were questioned after the first election. The SG
Election Committee at that time ruled that the expenditures made
by the Committee for Effective Student Government were complete-
ly legitimate. Since all the new expenditures that have been brought
up. have been the result of the efforts of the Committee for Effec-

According to the information

Susan Davis presented to Univer-
sity administrators: since before
the first Student Government elec-
tion. she’ had "arranged. ‘at, the re-
quest of Steve Cundra and his cam-

paign manager. John Cavuluchy.

to pay for campaign expenditures
for Cundra's United Student Coali-
tion Party. ' ‘A

She said that party campaign
expenses. as well as funds forga

supposedly independent organiza- -

tion called the Committee for Ef-

fective Student Government. were a
paid for with special funds depos-

ited for that express purpose in a

name. . . _
« Miss‘ Davis alleged that Cun-
dra's party received two separate
contributions totaling $1.000 from
an outside source which were de-
posited in her account. She claims
that $500 of this amount was an
outright gift from a corporate exe-
cutive and that the other $500 was
in the form of a promissay note
made out to Cundra.

Susan Davisstated that the pre-
vious financial statement submit-
ted by Cundra claiming that only
$196.22 had been spent in V to-
tal on his campaign was knowing-

, ly falsified. She admits to having

had full knowledge of the alleged
falsification. which was made he-
cessary because expenses for Stu-
dent Government campaigns are
limited to $200 by the Student Gov-
ernment Elections Committee.

their funding procedure from the ' '
beginning.’ She claims that one of" .
the factors that made her_ decide f;
. to reveal this information was the 

fact that she had received several

notices of, insufficient funds, ‘in—. A
cluding a notice from Burton:

Pitt ‘News, that a check made out

feared she along alone might have

outstanding debts.

Miss Davis told the Pitt News 
that,although she was concerned’ 
about her own security, she really  1

‘decided to reveal this alleged in 
formation because her conscience , 1”

bothered her and she felt she could

no longer keep silent about the fi- ' I‘

nancial mis-management that she

claimed helped get Cundra elected. .
