 BO Candidates in Fight

For 8 Congress Seats

By BOB THOMAS
- News Editor
A tWenty—man slate of ten juniors and ten seniors has
been named to clash for eight Student Congress posts on

'April 18.

Junior men picked are Gene Rock, Larry Adler, William

G. Bleakley,
Louis D’Angelo. Sherwood Epstein,
James Johnston-, Leo Kairys. Don
Milletary, and Alan Robbins.

The ten senior candidates are
Roger Bognar, James Burchﬁeld,
Gene Cowie, Robert Gardner,
{Richard Harper, Kenneth Lina-
men, Sam Shapiro, William Sulli-

. van, James Wall, and Cyril Wecht.

only One Independent

Nineteen of the nominees are
fraternity men; only senior Gene
Cowie is an independent.

Women’s Clearing House does
not expect to release the names of
coed SC candidates until after the
Women’s elections today. They
will be combined with the twenty
men nominees for combined vot-
ing on April 18. The new voting

system was assured at elections
last year by passage of an amend-

John Burwinke1,¢

ment to the SC Constitution.
Early Reports Conﬁrmed
Announcement by the SC nom-

'inating committee that only one

non-fraternity candidate will run
for ofﬁce conﬁrms earlier reports
that frat men would dominate the
elections.

It was thought that petitions of
two independent candidates would
be approved. but one of the men
was pared from the list by the
nominating committee when his
petition did not meet qualiﬁca-
tions.

In lieu of a controversial non-
fraternity slate as in former years,
student politicians are centering
their interest on the possible
makeup of the Interfraternity
Slate which will be made public
soon. '

(The NEWS will publish more
detailed information about each
of the SC candidates in the next
issue.)

Absentee List Before Deans

Chronic class-cutters may be in
hot water soon.

The new absence report form
that each faculty member is keep-
ing this Spring was due in the of-
ﬁces of the deans yesterday, ac-
éording to the Dean of Men’s of-
ﬂce. This report, due the tenth
of each month, lists the names of
all students whose class-cutting is
aﬁecting their work.

” GI Bill Veterans who are re-

ported for excessive absences face

a warning from the school and an
interview with the Veterans Ad-
ministration for clariﬁcation of
their status and their rights to
beneﬁts.

If the vet does not heed warn-
ings, or if he neglects to check
his status with the VA, he can be
dropped from school. Between ﬁve
and ten student vets were dis-
missed for violations of this rule
last semester. »

Schwarz, Kasmierski

To Head Panther

Five men were named today to
direct the three major student
publications for 1951-52. Two,
Leizer Balk and Victor Kasmier-
ski, were retainedas editor of The
Owl and business manager of
Panther Magazine, respectively.

At the helm of next year’s Pitt
News will be present managing
editor Edward Jensen. A junior,
Jensen has long experience on the
News, where he has served suc-
cessively as a reporter, copy staff
man, copy editor, and managing
editor.

Gained National Attention

As managing editor during the
past year, he was responsible for
the over-all production of the
newspaper, particularly Page 1

of his editorials and columns have
gained nationwide attention, be-
ing reprinted by -other college
newspapers and by the Associated

Unanimous

 

Resolution    

Urges Defeat of Bill

(See Letters to Editor on Page 4)

Student Congress has unanimously declared itself op-
posed to any and all loyalty oaths. _

The lawmakers concluded a longwinded Monday session
by voting their approval of a motion introduced by Andy

Schurman which read as follows: Resolved,'that loyalty oaths .
the hiring, ﬁring, or upgrading

not be used as criteria for

of faculty personnel. I
In contrast to some of the other
issues hashed over in the course
of the meeting, the oath stirred up
little debate among the politicos.
Thr-eat Brieﬂy Discussed
There seemed to be tacit agree-
ment that everything worth say-
ing on the subject had already
been said, but such things as the
general threat to civil liberties
and the more speciﬁc danger which
would arise from a loose inter-
pretation of the term “subversive
groups” were brieﬂy discussed.
Following the okay of the mo-
tion Corresponding S e c r e t a r y
Grace Salzman was directed to
send a copy of it to the state legis-

V

lature and to every state-supported
school in Pennsylvania.
Dance Chairman Sought
Earlier in the session Earl J acob,

chairman of SC’s appointments '-

committee. announced that there
is an urgent need for applicants
for positions on this spring’s sen-
ior dance, to be held, for the first
time, in the Commons Room.’
Jacob said that the positions of
chairman, business manager, ‘and\
publicity chairman are all open
to any juniors or seniors who wish
to apply.
Applications may be obtained’
from_ Miss McKay in the dean of
men’s oﬂice. ’

Over 30 Faculty Members Sign‘! 1
Names to Anti-Oath Statement

Faculty opinion here at the University is beginning to
crystallize against the proposed Loyalty Oath Bill.

As of Tuesday morning, over eighty of the faculty were
reported to have signed a statement condemning the “oath”.

as well as the proposed investiga-
tion of “communist principles.”
The statement, being circulated
by a committee of nine professors,
objects to the bill because of what
they term: (1) the ambiguity of
many of the terms, (2) its imprac-
tability, (3) a trend towards possi-
ble thought control as a result, and
(4) a possible side stepping of
controversial issues by teachers.
Court Throws Out Oath
. Meanwhile, in California in a
unanimous decision, the Third
District Court of Appeals ruled
that the Regents of the University
had violated the State Constitu-
tion in imposing a special non-

Communist oath as a condition of
employment.
Intentions Gaod

The court stated, “While this
court is mindful of the fact that
the action of the Regents was at
the outset motivated by a desire

to protect the University from the ,
inﬂuence of subversive elements A

dedicated to the overthrow ofvour
constitutional government, we are
also keenly aware that equal to
the danger of subversion from
without by means of force and vi-
olence, is the danger of subver-
sion from within by the gradual
whittling away and the resulting
disintegration of the very pillars
of our freedom.”

Stunt! up and Be Counted

In response to requests for direct action by students on
the proposed loyalty oath bill now in the General Assembly,
copies of the following letter are being circulated, to be sent
to Governor Fine at the end of this week. It is suggested
that students wishing to sign the letter, sign the master copy
in the Pitt News Office, 825 C1.

Honorable John S. Fine
Governor of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania

We, the undersigned students of the University of Pitts-
burgh, protest the hasty action of the State Senate in passing
the Pechan ‘loyalty oath’ bill, and earnestly desire that the
bill be opened to extended public hearings before it goes
any farther. ’

As students, we stand to lose more by this bill than
any -other group of citizens, including our professors. We
foresee a fear-ridden faculty here which, afraid to even
touch on any controversial subject, will be forced to present
watered-down, unrealistic education to us. We foresee stu-
dents, who, curious as to what all the fuss is about, will in-
vestigate communism on their own, a much more dangerous
situation than learning it in contrast with democracy in the
classroom. We foresee communist sympathizers pointing out
to impressionable students the fact that, since their teachers
are forbidden to mention communism, the students aren’t_
getting the whole story. And we foresee many good, earnest,
conservative non-communists leading the faculty rather than
submit to a state-imposed violation of their freedom of speech
and a violation of their contracts. All this can happen, as
it has already happened at the University of California,
should the loyalty oath bill be passed.

None of us are communists, and we doubt that any of,
us come under the liberal interpretation and deﬁnition of}:
‘subversive’ as presented in the bill, although the word can‘.
be stretched indeﬁnitely to cover almost anyone who hap-
pens to disagree with-the state administration.

We are not advocating, in this letter, outright killing
the bill. We merely request that a public hearing at which
all the issues and arguments‘ can be brought out be held.
We feel sure that, when these arguments are presented,
that the bill, if not dropped, can at least be altered to suit
all parties concerned. “

We respectfully request your help in making this public

Mr. Markowitz said, “to me, the fundamental issue in this
oyalty oath business is whether ANYONE expressing ANY
iewpoint, no matter how unpopular,
pportunity of being heard at a0

should be denied the

from communist propaganda? You
criticize Americans for trying to
indoctrinate and p r 0 p a gandize
their own, while condoning Com-
munist propaganda to turn them
against America.

An editorial on the same page
says that one of the first things a
Communist learns is to lie. Mr.
Markowitz says: “Then here is the
basic issue: do we have the guts
to risk the things we believe in
the arena of absolutely free de-
bate?” ‘

A fool wastes time with a liar,
and a bigger fool debates with one.

I don’t pretend to know the an-
swer to the loyalty oath ques-
tion, but, let’s stop this fantasy of
being so liberal we support the
enemy by over-liberal liberality.
My stand is to not set crooks and
traitors in positions of trust and
honor. It’s a rotten insult to a lot
of Americans, dead and alive, in
Korea.

It was a nice long article, Mr.
Markowitz, b_ut thereasoning was
rather lousy.

WI1yBotI:er at All?

Pitt students this year have taken greater strides to-
;ward effective student self—government than in any year.

 This, ingreat measure, was due to the contribution of
I such outstanding student representatives as Howard Green-
erger, Roy Titchworth, Bill McKinley, and others who were

True self-government at Pitt can continue to move for-
ward to its logical goal only if such leaders are chosen in-
telligently each spring by the student body.

Unfortunately, intelligent voting here is hamstrung by
University traditions and regulations which militate against '
, ny campaigning by which students can honestly judge the
relative merits of the candidates or be inspired to vote.

V Even fraternity men deplore the situation which al-
lows a minority element, IF Council, to decide for all in-
ents and purposes who shall be elected to what position.

This situation is possible because IF represents the only
__ _onsolidated interest group of voters, and is in effect THE
:.party .in a one—party set-up. It is to that body’s credit that
they chose capable men last year, but there is nothing to
Kprevent fraternity politics from frustrating similar choices
his year as it has done in other years.

. On-ly political campaigns and publicity, in the form of
ddresses and discussions in Cathedral rooms and through
sters on the ground ﬂoor, can provide any fair basis of
choice on the part of student voters.

We call for immediate repeal, therefore, of the regula-
'ons and controls limiting such activity. '
Failure to do so by the University authorities concerned
’ ill indicate to us What a lot of students have been saying
or a long time: the University doesn’t want an effectively
organized student government system. And if such is the
case, why have student government at all?

Too Little, Too Late?

Editor
Pitt News

of the Loyalty Oath was a ﬁne
example of what student journal-
ism can do to combat idiotic legis-
lation. But why did you wait until
Senate ratiﬁcation was a fait ac-
compli and Legislative approval
seemed imminent before stirring
your editorial wrath? How can you
expect educators and students.to
refute in one week what Hearst,
McCormick, McCarthy, et al. have
been screaming for weeks?

The American College Student
always has been a politically inert
conformist. Last week, when Ital-
ian students were wildly demon-
strating for the return of Trieste
and Greek students led the bloody
riots in favor of annexation» of
Cyprus, a small midwestern U. S.
college made the newspapers be-
cause of its petition for beer. This
last group is the amorphous force
to which you are appealing to go
out and stage an eleventh hour
battle against the mass hysterical
appeal of anything supposedly
Anti—Communistic  ,

I don’t doubt that many will
consider its blasphemous to ask a
student body which doesn’t sup-
port its own school elections to
start writing letters to its con-
gressmen. But the fact remains
that the-best academic opposition
in the world won’t suffice if the
Legislature. goes ahead and passes
the ‘Oath anyhow. ‘

Kinsey Not Lenin

Editor
Pitt News

In the April 6 issue of the News
an article appeared which made
me seriously consider becoming a
Laplander. It was entitled "‘The
Real Issue” and it was written by
a Mr. Jack Markowitz. In this ar-

teach in our universities, and he
feels that theintelligent student
will sift out what he wants to ac-

; cept.
Last week’s Pitt News coverage"

This is a very noble and courte-
ous attitude, and it is the same at-
titude which has allowed people
like the Rosenbergs, the Sobells,
and the Greenglasses to take our
atomic securities fora merry ride.
Any college professor will tell us
that the average student will be-
lieve what he wants to believe,
thats granted. However, in this
case, IS NOT the real issue. The
fact that these people are allowed
to rave openly against this coun-
try while three million men count
cadence, ﬁght and die as a result
of Communist activity; THAT IS

THE REAL ISSUE.

I think that all Communist-in-
clined professors should be given
a WX on their pay checks and re-
placed with some wholesome lec-
tures on the Kinsey report. ‘

Campus ‘Party Line’
Editor, '
Pitt News: -

Well it looks as though the ‘reds
can relax now that the Pitt News
is carrying the “party line.” I
hope, however, that the views ex-
pressed in the last two issues are
not shared by the school authori-
ties. These worthy gentlemen no
doubt realize that state aid brings

_a certain amount of state control.

If’ they resent this control, they
do not have to accept state funds.

The proposed loyalty checks are
very necessary since there is no.
way at presen to curb subver-
sives in the ﬁeld of education.
Most of the schools certainly
haven’t tried to clean up this sit-
uation, including the‘ Uni. of Pgh.
Instead some of them have.de-
fended their pinks. The Pitt News,
for example, whitewashed the

your creatures the worst of luck

in your present campaign.

Blame Yourself so Jensen 

Ever since our duly elected representatives began tinker-
ing with the loyalty oath bill up in Harrisburg, the local
citizenry has been working itself into a lather of righteous

indignation.

Opponents of the measure have
pointed out that it will in no way
restrict the subversives who will
have no qualms about signing a

piece of paper. They also blast it
on moral, ethical and s 0 c i a l
grounds.

The proponents of this choice bit
of legislation urge it on us as the
only effective means of preserving
our American heritage. They hold
that we are in deadly peril from

the some 100,000 commies in the
land.

Their argument falls to pieces
when you consider that they want
to preserve our democratic govern-
ment by using undemocratic po-
lice-state tactics. Itis also interest-
ing to note that the ratio of com-
mies to the untainted population is
about 1 per every 1500.

Opponents of the bill generally
fall in the more responsible class
in the community. Few belong to

the American Legion.

Here I would like to point out
that the opponents have no one to
blame but themselves. They elect-

in the plush seats of the upper and
lower houses in Harrisburg. The

heeding what they regard-as their
mandate from you.

Back in November we should
have been watching the ballot for
the Legionnaires and their crea-
tures. We should have known that

with a clear conscience if he has
stars and stripes in his eyes and

the Legion vote behind him.

Yes-Draft Students

*3‘
4...

JOHN KULAMER”

(Kulamer, a veteran student, is replying to “Yes—-Defer Stu-
dents” by Dave Winter in the last issue of the News.)

Some people are viewing with wild-eyed alarm the pros-
pect of a wholesale drafting of college students.

They are saying that if such were to happen our educa-
tional system would be shattered and the tender minds of
our country’s future leaders injured beyond repair.

.Assuming that the present
' international tension will stay
about as it is for quite a
while, and that the pressure
on our manpower resources
for military personnel will
mount, I see no good reason
,why that pressure should not
be relieved by the drafting of
present or potential college
students as soon as they be-
come eligible.

Vested Interests at Stake

This may be heresy, but I can’t
help noting that the attack our
educators are leveling at the stu-
dent draft idea seems to have in
it just a wee bit of personal mo-
tivation. Because if our schools
have to adopt a program of aus-
terity to offset a sharp drop in
revenue, -some deans and even a‘

president or two, might be out
looking for jobs.

Students won’t suffer. from an
army hitch. On the contrary,
they’ll be the better for it. A year
or two of living in the rough does
wonders for a man's evaluating
machinery; helps him see things
in their proper perspective.

They will appreciate much
more, for example, a college edu-
cation, and thereby proﬁt more
from it.

G|'s Job Is Soldiering

I, for one, to use a shining ex-
ample, would have gotten much
more out of my trip to England
had I known then what I do now
about its history. But things like
that are‘ for the most part inci-
dental to the GI’s main job-—so1-
diering, I

 

3
To admit that there is some-
thing in the last point and say
that a rich educational back-
ground would be a positive help
to the GI and to the Army is to
do nothing more than advance
the original hypothesis a step
further.

The logical conclusion is
that the best time to draft a
man is tight in the middle of
his‘ college work, or at the
end of three or four semes-
ters.

Experience Helps Learning

Then he would be in the en-
viable position of being able to
use his educational background
to enhance his Army career and,
upon discharge, apply the ex-
perience gained therefrom to the
rest of his education!

I repeat: let’s draft ’em now
and be done with it., The need for
an adequate defense is immedi-
ate and pressing, for the only
way we can ever maintain the

peace is to show to the whole

Lostoeter won nine of ten singles
matches and Campney eight of
ten. They played together in
seven doubles matches and were
undefeated.

Because of their ﬁne records
Lohstoeter and Campney repre-
sented Pitt last year in the inter-
collegiate tennis meet at Syracuse
and reached the semi-finals before
they were eliminated in the
doubles.

Lohstoeter, who can rightfully
be called ‘Mr, Tennis’ at Pitt, is

Oakland Hoop Title

By DON SCHURMAN
Sports Writer

Repeat All-Oakland basketball
champs twice and you have the
Dazzlirrg Dukes. The Dukes took
the title for the second straight
year by crushing the Carnegie
Tech champs, the Emanons. 44-34.
at Skibo gym on Monday night.

Last year it was also Emanon,
no name backwards, who were
victimized by the Dukes, then by
57-54. Pitt's IM champs have
now held the All-Oakland crown

for all five years of the Cham—,

pionship series.

Hero of the Duke victory was.3

as usual, their 6-3 graduating
senior center, Ronnie Weinstein.
Weinstein bowed out of the Pitt

IM hoop scene in fitting manner.-

maintaining not only his high
scorer reputation, with 17 points,

but also his sharpshooting distinc-f

tion.

He converted 8 of 16 xielder at-
tempts for a highly commendable
50 percent average.

Emanons Lead Early

The sloppy shooting and pass-
ing of both teams at the outset of
the game gave promise of a
thriller. After exchanging early
leads, the Emanons led 7-6 at the
quarter.

The action remained the same
through most of second period.
Then, trailing 11-10 with three

{minutes left, the Dukes began to
hit. By the time the half time
horn sounded, the Dukes had
jumped ahead 18-13.

From then on, the Emanons,
backwards or forwards, could not
stop the Dazzlers. By the end of
the third quarter they had boosted.
their lead to 34-18, and at one
stage of the ﬁnal stanza, they
doubled the Emanon output, 36-18.

With reserves finishing up, the
[Dukes coasted on their decisive
 lead.

Dukes Shooting Good
Statistics show that the Dukes

i the field for a 38 percent shooting
gmark, while their tight man-for-
lman defense held the Emanon to
:a poor 12 for 52, 23 percent.
Individual high for the E.nanons
was the eight points of guard
'_ Dick Schober.

 Softball Pending"

There is the ‘possibility that soft- 

iball may yet get underway this
rweek. Bemis will deﬁnitely de-
icide today whether he will sched-

i ule any games.
! Bemis plans to have nine leagues
‘in action this year. He has re-
ceived more than 50 team entries.

Games will be played at Schen-
ley Oval and at Ellsworth Center.

At Debate

  Convention

The debaters’ dream, the
six-day-long biennial Delta
Sigma Rho convention, will
take place this week in one
of Chicago’s largest hotels.

The four Pitt men making the
trip are Bernard McCowan, Ed
Burtell, Bob Gardner, and Cyril
Wecht.

The men left yesterday and are
making stops along the way to
debate midwestern schools. Yes-
terday they debated Denison, Ot-
terbein, and Ohio State. Today
they are visiting the University
of Indiana and Notre Dame. The
University of Chicago and North-
western will be met tomorrow.

McGowan Up for Speaker
The convention is run accord-
ing to strict parliamentary pro-
cedure and resembles the U. S.
House of ‘Representatives. Mc-
Gowan is a candidate for Speaker
of the Assembly, the highest of-
ﬁce. Burtell is up for the Repub-
lican caucus head, and Wecht for

the Democratic chairmanship.

The ‘discussion will center
around “Foreign Policy in Four
Areas.” Those areas are Western
Europe, Near East, Far East, and
Inter-America.

McGowan and Burtell are -going
as Republicans, and Wecht and
Gardner as Democrats. These af-
ﬁliations determine only which
party’s policies are advocated by
the individual representatives.

Tie For First Place

Lud Lippert, Ross Reese, Lloyd
Fugue, and Bill McKinley, won
four out of six debates at Heidel-
burg, Ohio. This was good for a
tie for ﬁrst place.

Besides all this traveling, high-
est honors were bestowed upon
Bob Gardner and Ed Burtell, who
were tapped to Delta Sigma’ Rho,
honorary forensic fraternity. They
will be initiated at the spring ban-
quet along with McGowan, who
was tapped last fall.

Planets Can He I Viewed
At Pitt ’s Observatory

By LEN

BAKER

Staﬂ‘ Reporter
The ﬂoor goes up and down and the ceiling opens in

the middle.

That, while not being a complete description of Pitt’s
Allegheny Observatory in North Side’s Riverview Park does

describe two of the many attrac-O
tions at the Observatory.

The real attractions, however,
are views of the Moon and Saturn
through the smaller of the obser-
vatory’s two telescopes every clear
evening until April 22.

Position Important

The raising and lowering of the
ﬂoor and the opening of the dome
ceiling are to bring the astronomer
into position with the larger tele-
scope and to allow an unrestricted
View of the heavens.

Used for astronomical research,
the observatory’s main job, accord-
ing to Dr. Nicholas E. Wagman,
director of ‘the observatory and
associate professor of astronomy,
is to determine distances of stars.

There are now 1750 distances

Hall.

Bishop Grifﬁths will speak un-
der the auspices of the University
Catholic Club.

The churchman has served
since 1943 as Chancellor of the
Military Ordinariate, which in-
cludes all Roman Catholicls
throughout the world serving in
the United States armed forces
and all Roman Catholic civilians
in military areas.

Bishop Griﬁiths in 1950 was

A
T

consecrated ﬁrst American Bishop
of the Titular See of Gaza and
military delegate to Cardinal
Spellman.

He has been associated in the
movement for the preservation
and internationalization of the
holy places in Jerusalem.

Dr. Bernard A. McAleer, presi-
dent of the club, will introduce
Bishop Griffiths in the ﬁnal lec-
ture of the 1950-51 series.

determined. Astronomy classes
also make use of the observatory
for practical study.

The large telescope has a 30-
inch lens and is the largest of its
type in the world. It contains a
camera which photographs stars
and planets.

Made Progress

In an international venture in
1930 to determine the distance to
the sun, the observatory contrib-
ut_ed by photographing a minor
planet.

Since the relationship between
the earth, the minor planet, and
the sun was known, the distance
between the sun and earth could
be determined by discovering the
distance between the planet and
either other body.

The observatory’s work was
considered the best in the northern
hemisphere.

Fame also came to-the observa-
tory in 18945 when it demonstrated
that the rings around Saturn were
made of tiny particles.

Pitt received the original build-
ings which housed the observatory
in 1867 from an association of
amateur astronomers which had
built it seven years before.

Expensive Equipment

The present building was dedi-
cated in 1912. The large telescope
was installed two years later at a
cost of $50,000.

Although the moving parts of
the telescope weigh eight tons, it
can be moved by hand because of
the accurate balancing. The tele-
scope has 78,000 pictures chalked
up to its credit in the last 37 years.
