THE

UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

By Brendan Kevenides
Senior Staff Writer

There is at least one major at
the University of Pittsburgh that
almost assures students the salary
and location of their choice upon
graduation.

”When a student graduates
with a degree in physical thera-
py, they usually have four or five
people coming to them at once
with job offers,” said Jim Kittle-
berger, head of the physical ther-
apy center in South Hills Village.
Kittleberger graduated from Pitt

several years ago with a degree

 

.-

in physical therapy.

”While I was at Pitt, one of my
professors told me, ’When you
graduate, you decide what city
you want to live in and get a job
there.’ ”

According to Dr. Rosemaiy
Scully, Pitt's physical therapy pro-
gram director, the department
here has a very large class of 140
students but still cannot keep up
with the demand for these
specialists.

Physical therapists are
specialists in reconstructing hu-
man bodies that have experi-
enced traumatic events such as

 

Has committee heard both sides?

Editor's Note: This article is the
third in a series investigating var-
ious aspects of the University of

Pittsburgh School of Medicine.

A congressional subcommittee
investigating conflict of interest

allegations in the University of

Pittsburgh School of Medicine
has heard only ”one side of the
story,” said Dr. Eugene Myers,
departmental head of otolaryn—
gology (ear, nose and throat).

”The dean [of Pitt School of
Medicine] was invited to
represent the university, but I still
think [the subcommittee] ‘_hasn’t

Myers said. ‘

Students and stress; survey 

By Michele Quinn
The Pitt News

In a recent survey conducted

by the University of Pittsburgh’

Counseling and Student De-
velopment Center, 59 percent of
the student population surveyed‘
felt the need for assistance to
overcome procrastination.
”Procrastination is common to
most of us in one way or another.
Some people proc_astinate, get
things together and-then get it
done," Dr. Robert Gallagher, the
director of the Counseling and
Student Development Center,
said. ”However, if a person.

° doesn't get things done, procrasti-

nation could ' result in poor
grades, dismissal from the univer-

I sity and significant problems in
their relationships.”

The survey was sent to 1,800
randomly selected students at all
academic levels of the universi-
ty, and the 600 responses were

sports or work-related accidents.
They also work with people
suffering from ailments such as
diabetes and muscular distrophy-.

Physical therapists are not doc-
tors, but they must receive official
certification before they are per-
mitted to practice. If a patient
needs a prescription for medi-
cine, he must receive it from a
physician. ,-

Why go to a physical therapist
rather than a physician? ”Because
we are effective," Kittleberger

Weiss now questions whether
Dr. Charles Bluestone, as direc-

Center at Children's Hospital,

National Institute of Health more

These grants allowed Bluestone

Dr. Erdem I. Cantekin, a Pitt

The survey was broken down
into personal, career develop-
ment and learning skills con-
cerns. The participants also
responded to 32 personal coun-
seling needs including ”fear of
failure,” ”relationships with
faculty members,” ”concern
about sexual functioning" and
”finding greater purpose in life.”

Three of the top five responses
to categories included ”increas-
ing self confidence,” ”increasing
motivation” and ”eliminating
self-defeating behavior.”

”Overcoming procrastination"

(45 percent) were ranked the

by the total sample but by each

Leaders stream into Tokyo for Hirohito funeral

TOKYO (AP) ~ Kings and
presidents streamed into Tokyo
on Wednesday for the funeral of
Emperor Hirohito, and authorities
tightened security even further
because of threats of violence by
radical groups.

King Hussein of Jordan, King
Juan Carlos of Spain and lndone-
sian President Suharto headed a
list of 71 delegations that arrived
Wednesday. Dignitaries repre-
senting 163 countries will be on
hand for Friday's state funeral for
Hirohito, who died Jan. 7 at age
87.

President Bush has an ambi-
tious agenda of a dozen brief
meetings with other leaders at the
funeral. Bush meets Prime
Minister Noboru Takeshita Thurs-
day, and first lady Barbara Bush
will take tea with Takeshita’s
wife, Naoko.

Emperor Akihito and Empress
Michiko, who have made daily
visits to join in a vigil in the
chamber in the Imperial Palace
where Hirohito’s coffin lies, will
meet each of the visiting dignitar-
ies in audiences and functions

scheduled through Tuesday.

  Official says Contra

aid denied repeatedly

WASHINGTON (AP) ~ The
former House intelligence com-
mittee chairman testified Wed-
nesday at Oliver North's trial that
his first inquiries about reports of
U.S. military help to the
Nicaraguan Contras met with
repeated official denials.

Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-lnd., the
first prosecution witness, said he
got denials in two letters from
then-National Security Adviser
Robert McFarlane and at a com-
mittee briefing before he finally
asked for a meeting with North,
then an aide on the National
Security Council staff.

The inquiries were first made in
August 1985, following news
reports that North was helping
raise money for the Contras and
giving the rebels tactical military
advice despite prohibitions on
U.S. aid first enacted by Congress

in the so-called Boland Amend-
ment of 1984.

’’Colonel North insisted he had
not violated the Boland Amend-
ment, that he was not assisting
the Contras by raising money,
that he had not provided any
military advice to the Contras,”
Hamilton said.

Hamilton said he asked

NEWS BRIEFS

McFarlane about the media
reports.

”When McFarlane told me
they were not engaged i‘n raising
funds for the Contras and that the

National Security Council was‘

not providing military advice 
I took Mr. McFarlane’s word for
it. I relied upon what the nation-
al security adviser for the presi-
dent told me.”

For that reason, said Hamilton,
he did not pose questions about
the Contras to the CIA or the
Defense Department.

Prosecutors are trying to show
that North, then a Marine lieu-

By Jenifer Crook
For The Pitt News

Ciao Vu and her sister Anh
moved to America from Vietnam
as children and never learned to
speak their native language
fluently.

The sisters always believed that
learning the Vietnamese lan-
guage and customs someday was
important in fully understanding
their heritage.

6 Now, as full—time students at

at

the University of Pittsburgh, the
sisters have the chance to learn
Vietnamese in a class offered
through Pitt's Language Acquisi-
tion Institute.

The LAI is a division of the lin-
guistics department at Pitt. Under
the direction of Dr. Courtenay
Meade Snellings, the ‘institute
offers ”uncommon‘ly taught” lan-
guages to Pitt students.

are not ”strange,” as many peo-
ple misconceive, Snellings said.
She explained that they are lan-
guages not widely studied or
practiced in the United States.

However, all of the rarely
taught languages are used exten-
sively in different regions of the
world, she said.

The languages offered by the
LAI this term are: Quechua
(American Indian), Thai, Arabic,
Dutch, Modern Greek, Hindi, Ir-
ish, Norwegian, Swedish, Swahili
(African), Tagalog (Phillipine),
Hungarian, Korean, Vietnamese
and American Sign Language.

Classes are offered each
semester subject to which lan-
guages students want to study,
said Snellings. She added that the
LAI will offer any language for
which there is an interested stu-
dent and a qualified instructor
available.

guage has an enrollment of over
200 students, most LAI classes
have a very small enrollment.
The Vu sisters are the only stu-
dents enrolled in the Vietnamese
class.

Because they are his only stu-
dents, the sisters receive a lot of
individual attention from their in-
structor. They learn much more
about Vietnam than just the lan—'
guage; they also learn the cus-
toms and cultures of the
Vietnamese people.

’’I have learned so many cus-
toms of the Vietnamese people I
never knew existed,” said Anh.

This is typical of all LAI class-
es, said Snellings. She said that
because of the small class sizes,
LAI students can ask their instruc-
tors to learn about any aspect of
a country.

The instructors of LAI classes
are native speakers of the lan-
guages they teach. ”The instruc-

tors give students their first—hand
knowledge of a country's lan-
guage and culture,” said
Snellings. _

The Vu sisters’ instructor, Dr.
Ung, was a dentist in Vietnam be-
fore he moved to the United
States at age 59. He has taught
Vietnamese for five years and
said he can ”share a lifetime of
experience” with his students.
He added that his students could
not learn of real day-to—day living
in Vietnam through a textbook or
an American professor.

The reasons students study an
uncommonly taught language
vary, said Snellings. She said that
some students take an LAI class
because it fulfills the language re-
quirement of many Pitt majors
and is ”a little different” than the
languages most frequently
studied.

Other students study an LAI
language for career reasons.

,LAI teaches studentsuncommon languages  

”Perhaps a political science
major plans to work abroad,”
Snellings said. ”Knowing the lan-
guage of that country is going to
be a bonus on his resume.”

Many students like Ciao and
Anh Vu study a language to bet-
ter understand their heritage,
while others study a rarely taught
language for purely personal
reasons. _

Ling recalled one such student.

”I had a student who was an

American female and took Viet-
namese so that she could talk to
her Vietnamese fiance's family
and better understand his way of
|ife,” he said. I
Students can study an LAI lan-

guage for up to four semesters. , r ‘

ings said.

Ex—Klansman hardly

suitable as legislator

In Louisiana, a horrifying thing has happened.

David Duke who won the race for the state legisla-
ture in a small town called Metairie, a suburb of New
Orleans. -

Duke is the president of an organization called the
National Association for the Advancement of White
People. He is a former member of the Ku Klux Klan.

And he succeeded in his bid for a seat in the New '

Orleans House of Representatives.
It boggles the mind that any group of people, even

A a group such as this, 99.6 percent white, could vote

for a man who is so blatantly involved in racist activi-
ty. Although he claims to have left the Klan 10 years
ago, his work phone number is the same as that of the
Klan offices in the local directory. And even if he had
completely disengaged himself from the organization,
he was still a member when he was young. A 28-year-
old man whose maturity is so incredibly underdeve-
loped could not grow in 10 years time to the level of
emotional responsibility suitable to be a member of a
legislative body. It is impossible.

Duke won by a 224 vote margin. He had 51 percent
of the vote, with a 78 percent voter turnout. It is shock-
ing that even with such a high voter turn out, Duke still
won. America went through its most famous stages of
racism and discrimination in the '50s and '60s. Since
then, it had seemed like we had learned something. Cer-

tainly, there was a long road ahead, but we had made I

some progress. Unfortunately, humanity seems to take
one step back for every step or two forward. Even the
endorsement of opposing candidate John Treen by
former-President Reagan and President Bush (both can-

_ didates were Republican) was not enough to stop this

from happening. What remains now is to mourn that
this has occurred, and wait for an another opportunity
to see this man removed from an office he does not
deserve.

Deadly serious crime

Wilkinsburg resident Eugene Allen was convicted on
Tuesday night on 12 counts of sexual abuse of children,
two counts of indecent assault and two more counts
of corrupting the morals of a minor.

The legal terminology fails to describe the sickness
in this man's crimes. The facts are that he took children,
abused them, then filmed and videotaped his perver-
sions. When asked why he kept these records, he re-
plied, ”For my own gratification.  They were for my

own sexual pleasure.”

As reported by the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, presid-
ing Judge Jeffrey A. Manning told Allen: ”I think you
are  fortunate that the laws prohibit the kind of punish-
ment that 'ustifiabIe an-ger [could have imposed].'’ He
also state that it is "a tribute to our system of justice”
that those involved in thecase could contain their
”sense of outrage” and work within the system.

While restraint and the idea of working within the
system are good, desirable traits, the system itself must
be able to express ”justifiable anger” and more impor-
tant, justice. .

Without debating its merits, itis a fact that we have
a death penalty. Since we have one, our system should
allow it to be applicable to men like Eugene Allen. The

' corruption, shame and destruction that they bring into

the lives of children_earn them suitable retribution. They

have tainted the lives of the innocent. Now let them.

What we could have had...

A ’miracle’ that went far astray

After all of the election media
hype about the great economic
situation in the state of Mas-
sachusetts, the truth has finally
been revealed: the ”Mas—
sachusetts Miracle” was a fraud.

PAUL G.
KENGOR

The Democrats highlighted the
so-called economic success of
the state of Massachusetts in an
attempt topush Gov. Michael
Dukakis to the top of the
presidential platform; but now
that the actual figures have been
provided, we can get a grasp on
what type of president Michael
Dukakis might actually have
been.

When questioned as to why
the American public thought so
favorably of President Reagan,
the majority replied that it was
the country's economic success.
Could Dukakis have kept us on v
this road of prosperity? To answer
that question, we'll let the num-,
bers do the talking.

Michael Dukakis, and a sub-
stantial number of Democrats,
have claimed that the most effi-
cient way to reduce the nation's
deficit is by raising taxes. Ironical-
ly, this-suggestion has had its
fie|d—test in the state of Mas-
sachusetts, where it has had nega-
tive results.

When Dukakis returned from
the campaign trail, the Mas-
sachusetts’ budget deficit had in-

‘ creased so significantly that not

even he could come up with any
excuses for its size. In 1987,
Dukakis was granted a $300 mil-

‘ lion tax increase for the state. He ~ _
. Apollo _,Computer lnc., -Data
. General Corp. and Wang Labora-

started 1987, with a. budget of
over $900 million, but by the end
of 1988, his surplus had trans-
formed into a $630 million
deficit. Could this be an indica-
tiori that raising taxes isn't an ef-
ficient way of reducing deficits?
In the mind of Michael Dukakis,
no. Two weeks ago, in an attempt
to mend this outrageous deficit,
the governor asked his state legis-
lature for a $735 million tax in-
crease. Hey Mr. Dukakis,_ take
some needed advice and read,’

  

   

.. ]ObS h

If we listen to the words of
many economists, deficits have
no real effect on the individual
American citizen —— this is true.
However, raising taxes to lower
deficits does. Taxes have become
so high in Massachusetts that
many of its people have relocat-
edto Gov. John Sununu’s (now
Bush's chief of staff) state of New
Hampshire, where the taxes and
deficit are considerably lower.
Sununu inherited a $44 million
deficit and balanced the budget
without significant tax increases
or new taxes.

Howard Foley, head of the
Massachusetts High .Technology
Council, has. said, ”Welcome
back to Taxachusetts, after all
these years of trying to get rid of
the monster.” .

According to the National Re-
view, Michael Dukakis has creat-
ed more debt in the last six years
than all of his predecessors com-
bined. Spending for the state has
risen 65 percent, a rate twice that
of the average state, and a growth
rate of four times that of the fed-
eral budget. E _

« Have these problems affecte
the cost of living in the state? Yes.
The cost of living has become
outrageous. The average price of
a single-family home in the
Boston area has risen to
$184,000, more than twice the
national average. The expansion
of many Boston-area businesses
has been hindered by this, with
many families relocating to more
economically feasible (out-of-
state) locations. Also, high hous-.
ing costs have scared away
potential employees from other

, states. ~ g -

Once"-corporate-giants such as”?

tories lnc., can no longer effec-
tively compete with. new
high-technology corporations be-
cause of forced cutbacks, partly
due to a lack of available hiring.

What about the‘ employment
growth? This is another illusion.
Dukakis boasted of the nearly
10,000 new employees hired in
the state in the past four years but
failed to reveal the‘ fact that
94,000, high-tech. manufa

time. In 1988, Massachusetts had
a 2.8 percent decline in manufac-
turing jobs, the largest in the
country.

Am I being too harsh on
Michael Dukakis? Let's analyze
the situation more closely. In
1975, the state unemployment
level was at 12.3 percent; by
1987, it was down to 2.6 perceg
However, this drop was due
mainly to the success of local
high technology (for example:
MIT, Apollo Computer lnc., Data
General Corp., Wang Laborato-
ries Inc.), medical research and
the many local companies taking
advantage of the Reagan defense
boom. Dukakis’ claim of the
credit for this is dubious. Univer-

sity of Massachusetts economiﬁ.

James Kendall has said, ”I don't
think that there's any evidence at
all to suggest that [Massachusetts]
government policies or taxes had
anything but a marginal effect” in
promoting growth; Kendall has
also stated, ”What really hap-
pened is that Massachusetts was
sitting in the right place at the
right time. The demand for our

products happened to increase, .

and away we went. Now, that de-
mand is going away.’,’ Indeed it
is. According to The Wall Street

Journal, the state unemployme 

rate has risen 0.7 percent in the
past year.

There are many lessons to learn
from this, but are we taking ad-
vantage of them? President Bush
is. Unlike the Demog:ratic.a_dvo-
cates of tax increase, Bush is

fiercely sticking to his pledge of ' I

no new taxes, claiming that they

would onlyfhu-rt Arfftericant 

' citizens and hinder growth.’

So c’moni Congress, open; you‘, _I 
eyes. and take advantage of this.” A

Michael Dukakis has provided fu-
ture leaders with an excellent ex-
ample of how not" to run an

 economy. I had hoped that some-

cturing_.. ,  ‘
' - ‘Vise

thing good would come from
this.

Oh, and by the way, Michael
Dukakis has decided not to run
for re-election as Governorlof

Massachusetts — I wonder whys‘, ; 3'.

PERSPECTIVE

0 THE PITT NEWS

Magical mystery tour: the fourth dimension and beyond  

I have some theories about
people. .
People are not quantifiable.

 

JOHN
BERGER

They can't be figured out. Not
with equations; not with intui-
6 tion. There is nothing that is quite

OPIN

so foreign as another person. You
don't know if a person is real or
just a cleverly crafted puppet. It
is just this sort of phenomenon
that you have to react to.

Let's think about the fourth
dimension. Vastly oversimplified,
and probably misinterpreted as
well, the fourth dimension is
time. Following me so far? Good.
Now, as we move through time,
we are moving through the fourth
dimension. We all move through
time in roughly the same com-
pass direction — that is, what we
call forward time. This is an as-
sumption, of Course, since as not-
ed above, people are foreign to
us.

So, we are all moving forward
in time, presumably swept along,
as particles of sand are swept in
a current of water. I

ONS

Now, let's think about this
water. We'll reduce time to three
dimensions for a moment, in a
vain effort to be clear. We'll use
water as a metaphor for time. We
are all bits of sand in a current of
water.

The world that we live in seems
to be three—dimensional. That is,
we relate to our surroundings in
terms of physical distance -— the
dimensions of height, length and
breadth. When you look at a
drawing of a cube, examine the
corner. There are three lines com-
ing together at the corner. These
lines are our three dimensions.

Since in the water-current
model, time has been demoted
from 4-D to 3-D, we have to
make our world the equivalent
2-D in the model.

All of the bits of sand are mov-

...what we choose today to be

When first viewing the article
across from mine about the mess
Michael Dukakis was in, I was
prepared to come back with a
scathing attack. I, too, was going
to quote figures and refer to
graphs that would make my argu-
ment shine.

And of course, I wasn't going

90 leave out all the fun little things
‘ th’at'oc'cu‘r‘réd'dur'i’ng the Reagan

Regime. For instance, how our
now—President Bush was a little
too chummy with that guy —
what's his name? Oh yeah,
Noriega. Or the fact that the in-
crease in employment was due to
the fact that more people were
working in McDonald's than in
the steel industry. (The latter hav-
Ing jumped over to Japan.)

However, what would I be tell-
ing you that you politically at-
tuned people haven't already
heard enough of through the
mudslinging from each candi-
date's platform?

So then, the approach... the
counterpoint to Paul Kengore’s
argument? Very simply, the past
is the past; let us concentrate on
what the current administration
has in store for us in the future.

Of course, there are those who
must focus on what has hap-

«Q pened instead of what's happen-

ing, so let us hopefullyclear this
up, once and for all.

Michael Dukakis is not our
president. He lost the election in
November of 1989 (although the

"margin was not as much as was

reported in the initial media
blitz). - i

' lworked for Mr. Dukakis’ cam-
paign because I thought he was
better than the alternative candi-

-Odate. Obviously, my views were

shared by agood number of peo-
ple; not enough to elect a man to
the highest office in the land,
though.

The people made a choice, and
believe it or not (those of you
who like to generalize about peo-
ple because of their political be-
liefs as if they reflected an
inherent defect of moral charac-

' 'iter), I respect the choice that was

made. It was the system that I be-
I ieve in that came to the conclu-

sion that Bush was better than _

 

Dukakis.

Now just because more people
agreed on Bush doesn't mean"
that I have to like the decision or
even agree with it. With that

 

JESSICA
COVILLE

statement, I'm sure I've acquired
a LIBERAL label for myself, which
is incorrect, but since most peo-
ple's minds work more easily
with generalizations and con-
venient categories, it seems the
easiest thing to say.

Since we're on the topic of
convenience, let's talk about the
safety and ignorance of shouting
rhetorical names such as LIBER-
AL and CONSERVATIVE.

Half of the damning souls
screaming these terms really
seem to have not one iota of in-
tellect that would enable them to
know what they actually mean.
It's merely easierthan saying that
they are the bad guys, i.e. the
LIBERALS or CONSERVATIVES
of our nightmares. I '

Now come on, folks, what are
we all really working for? To as-
sume that we can have an idyllic
existence here in this country or
anywhere else is preposterous.
Do you really want to have bil-
lions of clones of yourself walk-

ing around saying exactly what .

you say and feel?

Even those who care to assume
one of the titles of the aforemen-
tioned liberals and conservatives
certainly would not advocate a
1984-like society. If you happen
to think that Orwell was hitting
_on something good, please ac-
cept my apology and my sincere
concern. ' ‘

._ So what's the -answer, those

- Coping with our current reality

who are avid followers of
Michael and George? Is the word
harmony too hard a pill to swal-
low? Does it ring of an era when
people protested a war in the
streets and wore flowers in their
hair? I hope not, for that too is
gone.

Why can't we just accept the
fact that everyone isn't automati-
cally going to agree with what we
say, think, or feel? Moreover,
why do we damn those who
don't have similar beliefs?

Perhaps this grand counter-
point is merely a great excercise
in rhetoric, so let me say, as con-
cisely as I can: I believe in cer-
tain faculties, and I respect the
fact that you may not. I also
respect the fact that you have a
right to say that you don't agree
with me, but I'm not going to stop
saying what I believe for fear of
insulting you. As well, I would
hope that you will do the same.

Back to Michael and the ”Mas—
sachussetts Mess”... leave the guy
alone! It's 1989, folks. .1988 left
us and so did the elections. Like
it or not, we've got four yearsiof
George Bush. So LIBERALS and
CONSERVATIVES alike, stop
standing in the mud like a stuck
mule and accept the fact (or rev-
el in it).

Let's get on to other things like
making sure the food we eat isn't

full of injected hormones and that
anemic veal hangingiin a box is
plain cruelty... ah, but that's
another column down the road.

ing "upstream," rather coin-
cidentally in the same manner
that we are moving forward
through time.

Looking at the stream from
above,_the sands all seem to have
a certain relative location. They
all seem to be really close to each
other. They all seem to be in the
same place.

But look at it from underwater,
say, six feet behind the sand.
Now some of the sands, which
looked like they were right next
to each other from above, now
can be seen farther apart. Some
are at the top of the stream, and
some are at the bottom.

So, two-dimensionally, from

' the right perspective, some of the

sands look like they are close
together, when actually they are

not at all. Extend this to the
world.
Three-dimensionally, we all

seem to be really close together. I

Four-dimensionally, we are actu-
ally really far away from each
other. What we see around us,
and call ”other people” are ac-
tually images of things that are far

away. They aren't really people, ‘ r

they are shadows of people.

Sometimes the shadows are actu- -

ally close together, four-
dimensionally. This is when we
feel close to people. We feel like
we know them, maybe even that
we can see into their minds.

I could be wrong, but I
challenge anyone to have fol-
lowed enough of this column to
prove it.

 

'TypicaIly spineless’

The Pitt News reaction to
the closing of The Duquesne
Duke was typically spineless.
It is not that you were on the
wrong side of the issue, in-
deed you picked the right side,
but that you failed to properly
trash the censorship and the
censors. Of course, I do not
question the objectivity of The
Pitt News in these matters,

its purse strings are held by ,

There is no more heinous,
non-violent crime than closing
a student newspaper. For
many -collegians, students
newspapers are the only
source of information about
the outside world. It is often
the only source that they can
use to make informed deci-
sions in their lives. Even in an
urban environment, with
many forms of news media
available, students still rely
heavily on that information,
produced by a group of peers.

True, the Duquesne Student
Government Association allo-
cates the Duke's budget. True,
Duquesne University is a pri-
vate institution, and its values
can't always be reconciled
with the Constitutional

However, before this matter is
settled, one thing will become
clear. The students at Du-

provides a fine education, and
not, I'd be willing to bet, be-
cause they have warm, cudd-

Bias in the school of medicine

It's been interesting follow-;

charges aimed at the school of ’
medicine, especially Dr. My-
ers’ comment that the school
could accept drug company

and ethical. Idoubt it. Because‘
I'm a vegetarian, for years, I've
closely followed nutritional.
research around the country.

"Unfortunately, routinely and. I

consistently, nutrition depart-
ments of even the largest and,

most famous universities have  
come to research conclusions . ’

favorable to the companies
paying for their research. One
such university, over a short_
period, found that white flour
is nutritionally the same as
whole wheat; that sugar is a

very wholesome part of our.

studies, of course, were paid I
for by the flour, sugar and

think Pitt's departmental heads
want that history behind them
after they leave Pitt. Their ob-
vious suppression of and at-
tack on dissent makes the .
whole situation, _of course,
much more ominous.

Yet, the two situations al- I
ways seem to go hand in
hand; that is, the acceptance of
money from industries to do
research on their products,
and the later need by univer-
sity departments to attack in-
vestigations  and to suppress
dissent. Pitt's health school
seems headed in‘a dangerous .
direction. .

Survey

The survey also shows that un-
dergraduate students have a
greater degree of concern than
graduate students in all of the
categories.

’’I think that when you’re older
and have gotten over a major hur-
dle by receiving an undergradu-
ate degree, you usually have
some career directive,” Gallagher
said.

Undergraduates, however,
have an even greater level of con-
cern in all of the personal, career
and learning skills areas. These
students are also about seven
times more likely to have
problems controlling their drink-
ing than graduate students.

”This could mean that as we
get older we tend for the most
part to be a little less crazy with
our drinking habits, or it could

SHOWCASE Soundings

New Order
Technique
Factory/Qwest

New Order is what you might
call a schizophrenic band. The
band is known to alternate un-
predictably between a straightfor-
ward guitar-bass-drums format
and a disco—synth-new wave
sound for which they are, unfor-
tunately, more popular.

After the death of the band's
precursor, Joy Division, in 1980,
the reformed New Order re-
leased a brand—new, obviously
danceable sound that had many
Divisionheads screaming bloody
disco. Songs like ”Confusion”
and ”Blue Monday,” both huge
club hits, had the diehards whin-
ing ”SELL OUT!” from the
rooftops. New Order remained
strangely quiet and refused to do

interviews. What happened?
The answer is Technique. Brief-
ly, this album is a masterpiece.
But you don't get that impression
initially from ”Fine Time,” the al-
bum's first single. It's a confusing
song: no structure; no choruses,
ad nauseum; no identifiable
melody; barely any lyrics (what
does he mean by ”You’re much
too young to be a part of me?”);
just a steady metronomic beat —

what is this? Is this a song or a
mere 12-inch dance fodder remix
to make lots and lots of money?

Well, check it out. It seems like
this song was assembled in some

. Calman Shemi.

By Robert O'Connor

For The Pitt News

Pittsburgh gets many famous
and exciting visitors, but I doubt
that most of them have the abili-
ty to create such beauty as
Shemi uses his

~CALMAN SHEMI

patented process to create art
quite different from any other.
Calman Shemi visited Pitts-

burgh February 5-8 to open his
exhibition at Circle Gallery in
Shadyside with a reception to
benefit the United Jewish Feder-
ation. Shemi has been commis-

sioned by the Oxford Develop-
ment Company to do a ”soft
painting” for the renovated Radis-
son Hotel, and if this were not
enough, Pittsburgh Mayor Sophie
Masloff declared February 7
”Calman Shemi Day.”

Shemi works with all sorts of
media, including watercolor,
acrylics, sculpture and jewelry. It
is his ”soft painting,” which hap-
pens to be a medium that he
originated, for which he is most
famous.

Shemi first does a maquette in

watercolors of the sort of soft
painting that he wants to create,
which -acts as a working model.
He then lays out his own dyed
fibers onto a large piece of cloth.
When this is done to his satisfac-
tion, the design is sent through a
special machine of 9,000 needles
which presses the fibers into the
background material.

The final product is a vivid
tapestry that is virtually indistin-

guishable from an oil "painting ’

from even five feet away. The soft
painting looks like it was done in
oil, but the softness and little
bumps made by the fibers make
it feel like it was crocheted.

Shemi does not work in the
typical artist setting. Instead, he
is part of a commune in Israel
called a kibbutz. In Kibbutz Car-
mia everyone is taken care of
equally, and all work together for
the common good.

He studied and worked at
painting for over 10 years at the
kibbutz before selling anything.

Now he has 10 artisans working
under him to create his now-
famous soft paintings, and the
kibbutz is doing quite well, too.

Originally born in Argentina
but now a citizen of Israel, She-
mi mixes vivid South American
colors with an intensity found in

Israeli art. With the violence in '

the Middle East, one never knows
when something tragic may hap-
pen. The tension is reflected in

the art because the artist is forced

to live on the edge.

Steve Sailing, director of Circle
Gallery, said, ’’If you live in an in-
tense environment, every mo-
ment is a strong statement.” He
went on to say that an artist mere-.
ly recreates his impression of a
situation. He cited, as an exam-
ple, the violence in post-World

RUEBELIEVE

By Matthew Myers
Staff Writer

The trend in courtroom dramas
these days seems to place an un-
bearable importance on the un-
derdog lawyer and the Suspect
who stands falsely Accused, and
even on the trite silliness of tele-
vision's divorce re-enactments, in
which high drama and superb
acting reach new lows in
dullness.

Once in a while, a film like
Jagged Edge or a slick TV show
like LA. Law comes up and voi-

la! Ingenuity strikes.

True Believer is one of those
rare instances where courtroom
drama cleverly incorporates new
and innovative ideas into the
worn-out formula behind the
genre. In this film, we are spared
the usual legal mumbo jumbo
and the incredibly stereotyped
notions of justice which pervade
Hollywood cinema.

James Woods (Best Seller, Sal-
vador) stars as Eddie Dodd, a
criminal defense attorney who
specializes in springing midlevel
drug dealers in the New York tri-

mystery of wrongdoing and
cover—ups which reach the
highest levels of the city's law en-
forcement officials.

Meanwhile, a Manhattan dis-
trict attorney (Kurtwood Smith),
whom Dodd has fought against in
the past, becomes his opponent
in the case and soon threatens
everything Dodd stands for.

Eddie Dodd doesn't know if his
client is guilty or not, but his de-
termination to win the prisoner's
freedom turns into an obsession
— one which forces the defense
attorney to blindly trust a possi-
ble murderer whose enemies vio-
lently attempt to keep him locked
up forever.

True Believer is a compelling
picture, excellently directed with
stylish skill by Joseph Ruben,

who earned critical acclaim last
year for his terrifying film, The
Stepfather. Ruben plays the au-
dience with great sharpness and
imagination. In many scenes, he
swoops the camera up and down,
taking the audience from a dis-
passionate view to a close, inti-
mate embrace with the
characters.

Woods delivers another fine
performance, as the intense
defense attorney who combats
the city. He is tough and gritty in
the spirit of the self—made heros
Hammett and Chandler.

His deep affection for justice
and the underdog are sincerely
projected from Woods’ wonder-
ful, subtle style. Woods is an ac-

‘tor, like Gene Hackman, who

can say more in one line than

The supporting characters are
equally good, particularly Robert
Downey Jr. (Saturday Night Live,
The Pick—up Artist) who has final-
ly shed his obnoxious kid routine
and actually delivers something
in this film. His Roger Baron is
the epitome of yuppiedom and

. the conflict which arises in the

endless class struggle of modern
times. . ‘
Although‘many of the other
characters in True Believer are
not very well developed, a lot of
the film is indicative of quality
craftsmanship. One slight
problem which detracts from the
overall continuity, however, is
the rather noticeable blunder of

a camera operator who, appar— ‘

ently unbeknownst to editor
George Bowers, lowered" the
boom mike too far into the screen
frame in the final scene.

When I asked where the name
Waterhammers came from, the
answer wasn't plain and simple.
Just as this new band, a competi-
tor in the Rock Challenge, isn't
plain and simple, either.

The name derived from the
clanging, banging sound of an
old radiator in their first practice
space — an old office building in
the Strip District. They thought it
was a sniglet, and somebody fi-
nally remembered that it’s called
a waterhammer. And so came
about the name for this band, a

band made up of Harvey Coblin,
Stephen Morrison and Marc
Evans.

If you recognize any of these
names, it may be from their in-
volvement with The Affordable
Floors. Harvey Coblin is lead
singer, and Stephen Morrison is
back on stage with the Floors for
their Reunion Tour after having
left the band last year.

Joining them for the time being
and for the Rock Challenge are
Ken and Kevin Zencevich, Ken
being the drummer for The Floors
and Kevin being his twin brother.

When Morrison left The Floors,
Harvey was a little upset and
wanted to continue working with
him. For a while they talked

about it, but just never got it
together. It was Marc Evans who
brought them all together, and
the threesome formed The
Waterhammers.

They claim their style, their
words and music, are different
from that of The Floors. Accord-
ing to Morrison, ”lt’s not radical-
ly different, but it's different
enough that people who are into
The Floors might not necessarily
be into it.” Coblin added, ”lt’s
music The Floors are too scared
to do.”

The Waterhammers take the
stage for their debut on March 3
at Graffiti. Expect a new sound,
a new style, and some familiar
faces.

Shemi

Continued from page 9
War II German expressionist art,
which attempts to deal with the
question of recent history.

My first impression of Shemi’s
soft paintings involved the pure
impact of the fantastic colors. It
was difficult at first to overcome
the brightness and actually see
the full picture. Shemi strips away
all the confusing elements of a
scene and seems to leave just the
soul.

He recreates the building_

blocks of a scene, tempered by
his own feelings about it at the
time. I asked Sailing if the beau-
ty got in the way of the message,
because I was personally tempt-
ed to just admire the colors.

He thought that the attractive-
ness was a good thing. ’’It doesn't
stay in the way," Sailing said. ’’If
you present it to yourself continu-
ally, you begin to understand it,
then you have the ability to feel
what it is.”

I agree with this, but I found it
interesting when he told me what

. .
_-»;\:>_\\\~

Qihr 

\

.\\

 

type of people buy a Shemi. Sail-
ing stated that architects and
designers, the ”3—D visual” type,
show the most interest in Shemi’s
work.

He conceded that some people
do buy purely because of beau-

’ ty, but said this is mostly the

sophisticated art buyer.

Above all, Shemi’s work has a
way of creating colors that makes
the viewer want to continue to
look for so long that a message
will emerge.

Shemi’s work’ is on display
through March 4 in Circle Gallery
at 5416 Walnut St. Circle Gallery
has six pieces of jewelry, two
sculptures, two oil paintings and,
over 50 of the special soft
paintings.

Of his work Shemi has said,
”My art is communicative. You

will understand ifyou continue to 

|ook."

The Spanish film Women on
the Verge of a Nervous Break-
down is very enjoyable in a very
unusual way. This comedy isn't
conspicuously funny the way a
film like A Fish Called Wanda is.
It's a feel—good movie from a
different universe. A universe
where raw tension lies below the
surface, and you're not always
sure what to expect, or what to
laugh at.

The universe is director Pedro
Almodovar’s Spain — a nest of
unruly Latin yuppies concerned
only with fashion and love. Pepa
(Carmen Maura) and Ivan (Fer-
nando Guillen) are lovers who
work together acting and dub-
bing films. Ivan suddenly breaks
off the relationship, leaving Pepa
a message on her answering
machine.

Shocked and hurt, Pepa de-
cides to sell the apartment. in the
meantime, she waits there for
Ivan to call or stop by. Pepa’s
friend, Candela, shows up on the
run from the police. She also has
been betrayed by her boyfriend,
who she discovered was a Shiite
terrorist.
|van’s former lover, Lucia, also

THE Pl'lT NEWS, Thursday, February 23, W89

arrives, fresh from a mental insti-
tution in search of him. Pepa dis-
covers that Ivan and Lucia have
a son. As luck would have it, he
too winds up there with his fian-
cee, looking to buy the
apartment. "

All of this leads to a police can-
frontation, barbiturate-spiked gaz-
pacho, sex on a couch, a
motorcycle chase and finally, a
confrontation between Ivan and
Pepa.

Almodovar largely avoids con-
ventional gaggery and heavy use
of music (until the end). He wants
you to become involved but, un-
like so many comic film makers,
he doesn't force you to get in-
volved.

There are many curious inter-
ludes between instances of clear-
cut humor that pull you into the
”nervousness" of the film.
There's an unarticulated intensi-
ty in the characters (particularly
Pepa). Almodovar is a low—brow
clown who really cares about
people, stirring up sturm und
drang in a world that doesn't
know what that term means.

There's genuine sentiment
here,iand, unlike Woody Allen,
he doesn't treat his characters
flippantly and then expect you to
swoon when he says so.

It's rare that a recent film has
conveyed strong emotion without
lapsing into sappy button—pushing
(Rain Man, Terms of Endearment)
or unintentional self—parody
(Wings of Desire, Dangerous
Liaisons).

Hot, young directors like Jim
Jarmusch and Alex Cox are mak-
ing hip, original films. But for
them, hip means icy, aloof. For
Alomovador, hip means warm,
caring. He's a Fellini for the sit-
com generation.

Women on the Verge of a Ner-
vous Breakdown takes that odd
adolescent blend of melancholy
and goofiness and projects it onto
adulthood. It's a movie about ag-
ing people trying to stay young at
heart. There are so many mo-

. ments in life when you don't

know whether to let your heart
break or laugh out loud: You
usually end up doing both. Wom-
en on the Verge is a celebration
of those moments.

the disco grooves that built their
reputation and the distinctive
rock sound that is part of their
roots.

Techniqueis also marked by
singer Barney ”Rubble” Sum-
ner’s personal, introspective lyr-
ics, especially on the non-disco
songs. His constant switching be-
tween conviction and uncer-
tainty, between strength and
defeatism, is a painfully honest
portrait of the universally
screwed-up nature of rela-
tionships. _

He sounds so naive at times
that it can be both annoying and
refreshing, and he has a way of
singing cliches in the
appropriately-titled ”Mr. Disco”

. . . 0
that it's practically a revelation.

Actually, I preferred side two of
the album because it contains the
killer songs ”Run” and the abso-
lutely brilliant, fabulous, amazing
”Dream Attack.”

Despite the whirling contradic-
tions on the album and the in-
evitable confusion it maycause
in weak—hearted listeners, Tech-
nique manages to be a coherent,
thoughtful, and downright nifty
album. It succeeds because it

feeds the conventions of disco
through a critical, but amused,
sonic processor that results in
pure New Order. And besides,
it's hellishly danceable. So run
out and get this.

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, February 23, 1989

Q Is the ROTC program all that it can be?  

By Leigh Ann Johnston

_ For The Pitt News

How would you like to join the
largest fraternity on campus? All
you need is to meet certain height
and weight requirements, 20/20
corrected vision and no major
physical ailments.

If this describes you, you may
qualify for an Army Reserve
Officers Training Corps scholar-
ship, according to Lt. Col.

g Michael S. Geoghagen.

”We provide the leadership of
the U.S. Army, that's the bottom
line of what we do,” Geoghagen
said.

There are 145 cadets at Pitt, 30

percent of whom are females.
Geoghagen said the Army's big-
gest aim is to ”take care of your
people.”

Geoghagen says college ROTC
programs provide their students
with a more ”we|l-rounded” edu-
cation compared to one at an
academy such as West Point, be-
cause the cadets here experience
a broader education by being at
a college rather than an academy.
The ROTC program is at more
than 300 colleges throughout the
United States, and more than
8,000 seniors graduate every
year, earning a commission in. the
Army as a second lieutenant.

The Army ROTC program

offers a variety of scholarships.
There is a four—year, fu|l—tuition
scholarship which Geoghagen

estimates to be approximately
$7,000 a year, or 80 percent of
the school's cost (whichever is
greater). The scholarship covers
tuition and all other academic
and health fees. ROTC also pays
$180 per term for books, as well
as a $100 per month allowance
for juniors, seniors and scholar-
ship holders.

In exchange for all this, cadets
must finish the program and ac-
cept commission upon gradua-
tion from college, which involves
an additional eight-year commit-
ment in the Army Reserve.

Charges

Bernier only brought Lewis
Popper, university counsel, to the
September hearing.

Bernier is out of the country
and could not be reached for
comment.

”The reason I went along was
that the committee said [in a let-
ter] that they were interested in
what the university was doing
with research integrity policy

3 overall. So we were expecting

questions on that,” Popper said.
”When we got there, we realized
that wasn't what we were there
for at all.  Wedidn’t realize 
there was going to be intensive
questioning about a particular
problem.

”Frank|y, it never occurred to
us that they would spend an hour

.asking detailed questions con-
, cerning. Cantekin,

II

Popper
added. .

Popper said that Weiss’ letter of
invitation was not clear concern-
ing Bluestone’s and Myers’ at-
tendance.

Both Myers and Popper agree,
although for different reasons,
that the congressional subcom-
mittee should not be investigat-
ing Cantekin’s allegations of a
conflict of interest.

Myers said that he considers
Cantekin’s allegations ”to be the
university's departmental busi-
ness.” He stated that the univer-
sity handled the allegations
properly, according to its bylaws.

He added that the subcommit-
tee investigation is doing the
university a ”disservice to have
an outside source who was not
involved and not knowledgeable
of our process.”

Myers has charged Cantekin
with academic misconduct. The
university will review these

charges at a formal hearing on

Friday. A

Popper said that the congres-
sional subcommittee has every
right to investigate Cantekin’s al-
legations, which Pitt investigated

and closed, because they involve

federal funds. ‘He said that certain

aspects of the matter must now
be reviewed again by Pitt be-
cause Cantekin is being accused

_ of academic misconduct.

Popper added, however, that
the congressional subcommit-
tee’s investigation creates ”cer—
tain difficulties when they
investigate a matter still open” by
Pitt. ”

In a letter Myers received this
week, Weiss invited him to testi-
fy to the subcommittee.

Myers said he will not formal-
ly accept the invitation until he
consults with Bernier.

Ideally, students should begin
the ROTC program their fresh-
man year, because it is a four-
year program, but they can enter
as late as the end of their sopho-
more year.

”You’ve really got to want to
do it,” said Geoghagen, ”be-
cause it will be miserable [for
you] if you don't want to.” ROTC
starts freshmen with a gradual in-
troduction into the program. ”We
don't try to recruit anybody to
stay, because if I have to try to
make them stay, I don't want
them.”

One of Army ROTC’s biggest
events is the annual military ball,
set for March 18 this year in the

William Pitt Union, with guest
speaker Gen. Evelyn E. Foote.

One of the more interesting
parts of ROTC is its ranger team,
which Geoghagen said is ”one of
the toughest varsity sports in col-
lege.” -

The ROTC program provides
valuable experience not found in
other aspects of college, accord-
ing to Cadet Battallion Cmdr. Leo
lmpavido.

”There are a lot of benefits

from ROTC besides the monetary
[ones], such as the leadership ex-
perience, management and mili-
tary skills,” Impavido said. ”And
you get to meet lots of interesting
people.”

competetive, however. Out of an
average 400 students who apply
each year to Pitt's physical thera-
py program, approximately 70
are accepted, according to Joan
Albano, director of student affairs
and services for the School of
Health Related Professions. Also,
the mean grade point average of
those accepted is a 3.5.

For students who are accepted,
the difficulty level increases.

”Pitt’s physical therapy pro-
gram is like finishing medical
school in two years instead of
four,” Kittleberg said.

He said that attaining a degree
involves intense book study and
lab work. He added that after
receiving the degree, the gradu-
ate is probably more knowledge-
able than a student coming right
out of medical school.

Pitt students are eligible to
enter the physical therapy pro-

gram as juniors if they have satis-
fied the prerequisite require-
ments. In two years, these stu-
dents will receive a bachelor's
degree in physical therapy.

In 1991, Pitt will begin a pro-
gram in which the bachelor's
degree in physical therapy will be
eliminated. In this new program,
a student can receive a bachelor's
degree in the field of his choice
before applying to the two-year
program to receive a masters
degree.

Promise is a word that must be
getting under Connecticut basket-
ball coach Jim Calhoun’s skin.

Since the end of last season,
when Calhoun’s Huskies won
five consecutive postseason
games to win the National Invita-
tional Tournament title, that word
— promise — has haunted him,
and with good reason.

UConn returned all five of last
year's starters, including 6-foot-1 1
center-forward Cliff Robinson
and NlT MVP guard Phil Gam-
ble. The team lost only two play-
ers of consequence — 6-10
center Jeff King and 6-5 guard

The Pitt wrestling team
dropped its final home match of
the season to the West Virginia
Mountaineers by a 19-17 score
last night at Fitzgerald Field
House.

and 'tol’2'-4 “iii the l Elastern
Wrestling League. .

Last night also marked defend-
ing national champion Pat San-
toro’s last match as a Panther.
The three-time Al|—American will
leave as Pitt's all-time winningest
wrestler.

He is the only Panther wrestler
to win 100 matches at Pitt. San-
toro has a .940 winning percen-
tage with a lifetime record of
157-10.

During his championship sea-
son last year, Santoro went un-
defeated at 48-0 and became
Pitt's first national champio
since 1963. '

And the Huskies’ recruiting
class was as long as i_t was solid,
including such players as All-
Connecticut guard Chris Smith,
6-9 forward Rod Sellers and
7-footers Dan Cyrulik and Marc
Suhr.

But Calhoun wasn't as quick to
hop on the bandwagon of
promise as was the 35-member
entourage of reporters, known as
the ”Horde,” who cover the

’ Husksies.

”Sure, we return a lot of peo-
ple,” Calhoun said at the Big East
media day in November. ”But
we have people returning from a
ninth-place team.

”We certainly could be better

Sterner said.

defense. He really puts the heat —

added.

But Calhoun’s reservations
were not imaginary or unwarrant-
ed. The Huskies, who found
themselves in the top 20 at the
beginning of the season, have
fallen to 5-8 and eighth place in
the Big East and 14-9 overall.

Bruno really doesn't have a chance
against Tyson in Las Vegas title fight  3

Once and for all.

That was how promoters were
billing the Mike Tyson-Michael
Spinks fight back in June.

lt seems strange that there is a
Mike Tyson (undisputed
heavyweight champion) fight
scheduled for Saturday night
which is not getting possible me-
dia attention.

Maybe it is becausethe fight
has now been delayed five times,
for one reason or another, and
some did not think it was ever go-
ing to come about.

Tyson will be taking on Frank
Bruno, a guy from England who
looks good —- that is until he steps
into the ring to start fighting.

On paper this fight would seem
to have some real appeal to box-
ing fans around the world and,
most of all, England. Boxing in
England has taken a real beating
in recent times. Most notable is

r

1 -the case of Lloyd Honeyghan. . _

 

But the Panthers, who travel to
Hartford this Saturday for their fi-
nal road game of the season, are
not so quick to dismiss the
Huskies.

”They are a good team,” said
Pitt point guard Sean Miller.
”They have a lot of guys
returning.”

And all of those returnees
watched UConn take Pitt to the
wire twice last season, losing
61-58 at the Fitzgerald Field
House and 74-69 at the Hartford
Civic Center.

The Panthers also whipped the
Huskies in the first round of the
Big East Tournament by a 75-58
score.

”We’re a totally different team

year here. Most likely, next year's
team will be seeing him in the
practice room in a coaching roll.
And mother Mary may not get
much of a chance to rest her pre-
match anxieties as her son has his
sights on the 1992 Olympics.

In 1986, Honeyghan was on
top of the boxing world after
beating Donald Curry, who at the
time was, pound-for-pound, con-
sidered to be the top fighter in the
world. Two weeks ago, Honey-
ghan lost his title to Marlon

Starling‘. So there goes Britain's

Enter Bruno, who has a body
that would make Mr. Olympia
Jealous, but has a glass jaw that
Waterford Crystal should be
jealous of.

Bruno burst on the scene much
the same way Tyson did — 21
straight wins, all by knockout.

Then came Bruno's big chance
in May of 1984. ‘Bruno was tak-

think our strengths are the same.
I'm looking for the same thing as
last year.”

Last year, Pitt's big men —
Charles Smith, Jerome Lane and
Demetreus Gore —— combined for
43 points and 29 rebounds at
Hartford.

Miller will look to go to the in-
side combination of Bobby Mar-
tin and Brian Shorter this time
around. '

nesday.

lnjury or not, Robinson will
provide formidable opposition
for the 6-9 sophomore.

”lt’ll be a learning experience,”
Martin said. ”l’ll just have to try
to play good defense on him.”

"He's a player who can go to
the next level,” Miller said of
Robinson, who was nursing an
ankle injury against the Panthers
last season.

Shorter, who will be playing
against Connecticut for the first
time, was confident that the suc-
cess he has hadlthis season —
he's averaging 20.3 points and
9.8 rebounds per game — will
carry over to this game.

’’I have a lot of confidence in
myself, and everybody else has a
lot of confidence in me, too,"
said Shorter, who has become
Pitt's ”go to” man.

Connecticut fields a deep
bench. The Panthers, who have
played most of the season as a
six-man team, may not play start-
ing shooting guard Jason Mat-
thews, who twisted his knee
against Villanova. Sixth man Rod
Brookin should start if Matthews,

‘who is listed as day to day,.

cannot. - —

”That’s another shooter we
don't have on the bench,” said a
concerned Martin. ”Now we've
only got Rod."

Brookin poured in 18 points
against Villanova, nine on three
three-point shots.

But the Panthers will have had
four days off when they venture
to UConn on Saturday, and
£\./.l.il.Le.r,...f.<.>.r..c>.r1.e,. is glad, despite
the relatively long break in the
team's four-game winning streak.

”We’re playing well right now.
I'm just happy to have a few days
off so Jason and Bobby can rest.”

The Panthers, who were 1 1-10
on Feb. 7, have defeated George-
town, St. John's, Seton Hall and
Villanova since, to move into sole
possession of fourth’ place in the
Big East and, more important,
closer to an NCAA tourney bid.
The Associated Press ‘rates Pitt
22nd, while USA Today rates Pitt
No.23.

But the Panthers have strung
their wins together by taking each
game one at a time, and they
don't plan to change for UConn.

”We can't be thinking about
the NCAAs,” Martin said, ”Right
now, we have to‘ be thinking
about finishing our season.”

Miller believes Pitt has an_ace
in the hole when it comes to the
tournament.

”People are always going to
say we're on the bubble because
of our win—loss record. But we
have some things other teams on
the bubble don't have: wins over
big teams.”

Pitt has defeated four top 10
teams this season: Syracuse
(81-76), Seton Hall (82-79 and
82-76), Oklahoma (99-91) and
Georgetown (79-74). Wins
against possible NCAA tourney
competitors Florida and Oklaho-
ma State will also help Pitt's
chances.

A NOTES: The Panthers will have
a week off after this game to pre-
pare for their final game of the
season, against Connecticut, at

Panther hockey club gets ready for playoffs 0

By John Labriola

Staff Writer

The stage has been set, the ice
has been chilled. All that is left to
do,is start the game.

On Saturday, Feb. 25, the West
Penn College Hockey Associa-
tion will be holding its first-round
playoff games at the Belmont
Complex in Kittanning, Pa.

The first of the two games

scheduled for Saturday will have
the No.1 ranked Pitt Panthers tak-
ing on the No.4 ranked West Vir-
ginia Mountaineers.

West Virginia came into the
playoffs at the last minute by
defeating Penn State-West twice
this past weekend, bringing its
ranking up to tie Slippery Rock
University for fourth place.

ed Slippery Rock in a head-to-
head game on Feb. 11, they
knocked Slippery Rock out of the
playoffs,” said Brian Owens, the
Panthers’ club president.
Faceoff is set for 3 p.m.

The second game has the No.2
ranked Carnegie Mellon Univer-
sity Tartans facing the No.3
ranked Indiana University of
Pennsylvania Apaches. The game
is scheduled to begin at 5 p.m.,
immediately following the Pan-
thers’ game.

The winners of this round will
go on to play in the second
round.

The championship round will
be played the following day at

Golden Mile Ice Center on Old
Frankstown Road, Monroeville
(Route 286, Holiday Park).

Faceoff is scheduled for 4:30 p.m. -

The Panthers are favored to win
this year's trophy. The last cham-
pionship game that the Panthers
won was during the 1981-82
season.

” We aren't feeling any pres-
sure going into this weekend, but
we are looking forward to bring-
ing home the championship ti-
tle,” Owens stated.

''I’m a little overconfident, so
I say we're going to win,” added
Owens.

The Panthers may seem a little
overconfident, but they have

good reasons. They've finished
first in their league with an un-
defeated record (11-0) and six
points above their closest compe-
titor, CMU.

Last year the Panthers went into
the playoffs in second place, only
to lose to CMU in the first round.

"Last year, if you'll look at our
three losses, we had one against
Carnegie Mellon [and] two loss-
es against Gannon.

"The losses were mainly be-
cause our goaltender never
showed up and the attitude of our
team sucked. Now we are a more
mature team —- better goaltend-
ing, better attitude '— and we
want to win," Owens said.

for sure, but this fight is no differ-

cept that he is fighting someone
whose caliber he has never be-

Bruno's last fight was against
37-year-old Joe Bugner in Oc-
tober of 1987. Bugner used to be
the favorite of the English fight
fan.

Not anymore, though Bugner is
now touting himself as ”Aussie
Joe.” Bruno punished Bugner for
eight rounds. Bruno might have
been keeping Bugner around to
teach him a lesson, but more like-

. ly he was just unable to knock-

out a human punching bag. What
is he going do against a man like
Tyson who has incredible
amounts of defensive skill?
Let's look at Bruno as a fighter
now. With a finely chisled body,
he often resembles a statue in the
ring. He does not show good
lateral movement and moves
straight back from punches. So,
even Tyson at his worst (lunging
at his opponent) should be able
to connect on Bruno's chin.
Bruno fights like most Europe-
ans — straight up. Against weak-

er opposition he is able to land
stiff jabs, although they never
land in succession. Bruno's best
punch is the right cross that was
effective against James ”Quick”
Tillis and Coetzee, but was una-
ble to hinder either Smith or
Witherspoon.

It will be interesting to see how
many times Bruno hits Tyson
with his one—shot—at-a—time ap-
proach.' The ‘base of Tyson's
defense is the peek—a—boo style
that was taught to him by Cus
D’Amato.

Tyson in the ring is perpetual
movement, and against Bruno it
will seem like Tyson is fighting a
punching bag. If Bruno does try
to show some movement in the
ring, it will not affect Tyson. Ty-
son caught and punished slick
movers like Tyrell Biggs and Tony
Tucken

These two really only have one
significant common opponent,
Smith. Bruno was taken out by
Smith in the 10th round, but Ty-
son had to be content to waltz all
night with Smith, who turned into
the ”Bonehugger” for 12 rounds
in 1987.

so many times because of Tyson's
troubles outside the ring, and that
is probably the only possible
edge Bruno may have in this
fight.

Bruno is catching Tyson at the
perfect time. Tyson has just com-
pleted the filing of his divorce
from actress Robin Givens and
his recent split with longtime
trainer Kevin Rooney.

In June, when Tyson was get-
ting ready to fight Spinks, the
word was that all of the publicity
surrounding his stormy marriage
to Givens was distracting him
from his preparation. It distract-
ed him so much that it only took
him 91 seconds to knock Spinks

out of boxing.

There is still a link with de-
ceased D’Amato in the new Ty-
son corner, and that man is Jay
Bright, who is now co-trainer
along with Aaron Snowell.
Bright, like Tyson, was a troubled
youth and spent much of his
childhood living at“D’Amato’s
home, and he gradually
progressed into the world of train-
ing fighters.

At 35-0 with 31 knockouts, Ty-
son will be Bruno’s third tough‘
opponent, and there is no reason
to think Bruno will perform any
differently this time. Bruno, 32-2,
will be knocked out inside of
