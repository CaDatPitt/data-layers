It’s called “planned mobility”—a sort of

A new year. A new term.

buildup, a look at the term past and
the term present are of utmost im-
portance to each student.

. Last term many students re-
turned to school brimming with the
bubbling optimism that was indica-
tive of students allover the country.
The national elections, a poor foot-
ball season, and administrative static
did much to wipe out that optimism

A few constructive goals result-
ed from the hard work of many stu-
dents here last term, and these gains

 should be in the mind of each stu-

dent as the upcoming Student Gov-
ernment elections draw near.

With the start of this term, cur-
fews for female students are being
revised to allow the coeds more re-
sponsibility in determining their own

I have been alive for close to 22
years but it took this past Christmas to
make me realize that I do not,_ and never
have, understood what it means to ’have
the Christmas spirit. I believe however,
that the answer to what the Christmas
spirit actually is must come from with-
in me and not from what others tell me.
At first I thought that it was a spirit ex-
clusive to Christmasand Christiansbut
I really don’t believe that now. I don’t
believe that it is a spirit that must begin
on December 25th and die on December
26th.

I turned to television for the answer.
During the vacation I had plenty of time
to watch all those ho-ho Santa shows.

I still couldn’t find a solution.

There was plenty of laughter. and
bright decorations to be seen but it all
seemed so conventionalized and hollow.

this and other publications if the new
powers-to-be fails in its task of not
only following up present policies,
but initiating new ones as well.

A conservative Student Govern-
ment could be as strong a threat to
continued success as an extremely
radical one. The rare blend of polit-
ical finesse that was used to con-
structive ends in the past year, must

be followed by the new “politicians”
this year.

Although it may be a few weeks
premature, we of the Pitt News feel
that students, -faculty and adminis-
tration alike will long remember the
strong bridge between students, fac-
ulty, and administration that Student

Government built in the past year.

This bridge must not be broken in

the future.
This bridge was built with hours,

days and weeks of hard work by
many students; extreme radical or
‘conservative action in the next year
could ruin that bridge and widen the

gap that existed in the past.

meaningful or meaningless. But I’m not
worried. Something tells me I’ll make the
right choice. I know myself now.

A Like all men, I will make some con-
tribution to life‘ and society. I used to
complain about my life and my problems.
Now I thinkvthat life doesn’t owe me a
damn thing. ButI owe a great deal to
life. And like all of’ my peers, I will
make my life payment. .

 

irig Scrooge, believes in the Christmas
spirit. Some say it is the spirit of giving;
to others it means good cheer and good
will towards one’s fellow men. To some,

- it is the spirit that provides an occasion

for receiving all those gifts. It also
seems to be the spirit that providesvan
occasion for giving all those gifts. But I
wonder how many people opened their
presents and thought to themselves:
there is an underlying principle here and
it means peace.

I suspect that the Christmas spirit
is the culmination of all those things like-
giving and good cheer etc. Yet, in my op-
inion people don’t take enough time to
carefully analyze what this season of
good cheer really means. It goes way be-
yond December 25th. It goes beyond
being the perfect day for a party or the
day to catch up on rest or a day away
from work. a

I think this spirit could exist for us
now at Pitt. It could start with the Viet
Nam Christmas truce and continue‘
through New Year’s, through Easter,
through the Fourth of July. It will exist
if we want-it to. The best that could come
of a_year round Christmas spirit is that
everyone will have the courage to try
and understand what it means to. live
without fear of others.

Idealistic? Maybe, but why,not? Isn’t
it worth our while to take our precious
time and devote it to understanding oth-
e_rs? If we start now, maybe we can de-

velop the habit. I think that is what the

\ Christmas spirit is all about.

Frank Kush:
One More
Bad Dream

by GEORGE LIES
Associate Editor

It was very late Wednesday, deadline
night and many thoughts romped through
my mind. But I felt weak from just eat-
ing hotdogs and hamburgers for the past
two days, and I didn’t have the strength
toput anything on paper. It was some-
thing like dreaming,
while sleeping.

Well, yesterday I i
woke up from the dream
I knew it was unreal.
who would ever think
that.a guy by the name
of Frank Kush would
come to Pitt to coach
football. It’s unheard of;
and like I said unreal.

Who would ever think that a man with
a perfect setup—money, talented ball-
players, no recruiting restrictions, little if
any academic requirements, plenty of
sunshine, and contentment — would
come to Pittsburgh. T

WHO WOULD GIVE-UP all of that
to come to a city whose streets are full
of potholes, whose city hall is the home
of Mayor Joseph Barr, and whose “Gate-
way to the West” resembles the recluse
of Sleeping Beauty?”

MR. LIES

Who would want to die in a dying city?
Who would want to put up with nostalgia
forever, the lack of good entertainment
downtown after midnight, and taxes up-
on taxes upon taxes?

I didn’t think (in the dream, naturally),
Frank Kush was that crazy. Somebody
would have pulled him aside and explain-
ed what Pitt was about. Somebody would
have said, “Now listen Frank. I’m telling
this to you for your own good. Don’t do
it.” -

AND ANYWAY, Arizona Stateypeople
would say, “Hey Frank, here’s a little ex-
tra. Don’t worry about those two losses
last year. And we’ll see what we can do
for the wife and kids.”

I could see me trying to explain this
dream to a friend. He’d probably say,
“uh, you better go see somebody about
your problem Or, you better lay off
those hamburgers and hotdogs.”

If Kush ever came here, it would be too
good to be true. He’d probably have a
“change of heart” and turn down the job.
He’d probably ruin a reputation for hon-
esty. And‘ no one wants to be consider-
ed a bastard. .

N0 PROFESSOR would give a student
a C grade after saying he had earned an
‘A grade. No fiance would change his
mind about getting married. And no stu-
dent government senator would resign
from an elected position.‘ Their reputations
would be considered smut; similar to an
abortion. -

Frank Kush would never let this happen
to him. He would never. leave Arizona to
sign - a contract to coach Pitt football
teams. . ‘

That would be like Santa Claus leav-

ing the North Pole to go to the South Pole,
Clarabelle leaving the Howdy Doody show
to join Soupy Sales, or Humphrey Bogart
leaving the role of a gangster to por-
tray a queer.

_THESE ARE THINGS that are unbe-
lievable; they’re dreams.

Well, like I said before, I woke up yes-
terday. Nothing had changed. I didn’t ex-
pect it to change. It was all a wild dream,
probably brought on by a lousy hotdog,

' an uncooked hamburger, or a university

that doesn’t really care. Anymore. ’

Winter Term Entrants
Undergo Orientation

"I thought that I was through
with this kind of thing when I
was a freshman the first term. This
groan was typical of the transfer
and relocating students who un-
derwent an all-day orientation
Monday.

 

SCHUELER TO SPEAK

Ken Schueler, student body
president, will speak on “Stu-
dent’ Politics” Monday at noon
in the SU Ballroom. According
to Schueler, his talk will be “a
kind of scholarly rap on stu-‘
dent activism, the radicals of
the new left, student power in
university goverance, and the
responses of the American Uni-
versity, and society to t h o s e
minority phenomenon.”

Schueler explained that “tra-
ditionally, American students
have cultivated a- long history
of political tranquility. Today,
however, we-’re experiencing
the growth of a significant stu-
dent movement in this country.

 

The progra m, run by Scott
Dragan and Ed Gill, featured the

, traditional advisor meetings, pep

talks and advice usually given to
entering Freshmen.

The day was highlighted by a

-luncheon in the SU Ballroom at

w h i c h the new students w e r e
broken up into groups and assist-
ed by student hosts and hostesses.

SG Senator Dave Guydan nar-
rated a series of 80 slides present-
ing the best sides of the campus,
student organizations and pro-
grams, and University life in gen-
eral. His humorous handling of
the.‘ task relieved anticipated bore-
dom and broke up more than a
few present, including Dr. Pos-
var and Dean Pease.

All in all, the three hundred-
odd participants expressed the sen-
timent that the orientation effort
helped them to “feel a part of
the University.” However, they
still don’t know where Crawford
Hall is.

Campaign For SG
’ Positions Begins  

Student Government elections
will be held Jan. 22. Twenty-sev-
en positions will be filled by the
election. The SG President and
Vice-President will be elected

lege of Arts and Sciences, four

ing, one seat in the School of Ed-
ucation, one seat in the School

representatives for the Pitt News
Executive Committee will be

Petitions are now available at
the SU desk. Campaigning will

Whenever female orgasm is dis-
cussed, a false distinction is made
between the vaginal and clitoral
orgasm. Frigidity has generally
been defined by men as the fail-
ure of women to have vaginal or-
gasms. Actually, the vagina is not
a highly sensitive area and is not
physiologically constructed t 0
achieve orgasm. The clitoris is the
sensitive area and is the female
equivalent of the penis. I think
this explains a great many things.

First, the so-called frigidity rate

among women is phenomenal. Us-
ually we are told that it is our
hang-up if we don’t have an or-
gasm and most women accept this
analysis. But men are hung-up
too, and they have orgasms, so I
think we must look for causes
elsewhere.

What actually happens is this:
there is only one area for sexual
climax (although there are many
areas for general sexual arousal)
——the clitoris. All orgasms are ex-
tensions of sensations from this
area. Since the clitoris is usally

not directly stimulated in the con-

ventional sexual position, we are
left “frigid.” The only other kind
of ' stimulation is purely psycho-
logical, the kind of orgasm
a eh i e v e (1 through fetishes o r
thinking or dreaming about some-
one. But this kind of orgasm isinot
caused by friction with the 'va-
gina and therefore cannot be con-
sidered a vaginal orgasm. Rather,

_ it is a psychologically caused or-

gasm which manifests itself phy-
sically in the clitoris. Of the or-
gasms that are caused by physical
contact with the clitoris, there
may be many degrees of intensi-

ty, some more localized and some
which are more diffuse and sen-
sitive. The physical organ which
causes them, however, is the clit-
oris.

All this leads to some interest-

, ing questions about conventional

sex and our role in it. Men have
orgasms essentially by friction
with the vagina, not with the clit-

oris — which isexternal and not

able to cause friction the way
penetration does. Women have
thus been defined sexually in
terms of what pleases men; our
own biology has not been proper-
ly analyzed. Instead, we have

been fed a myth of the liberated’

women and her vaginal orgasm,

 

an orgasm which in fact does not
exist. . ,.

What we must do is redefine
our sexuality. We must discard‘-
the “normal” concepts of sex and”
create new guidelines which .take‘,

. into account mutual sexual enjoy- ‘

ment. While the ideas of mutual»
enjoyment is acknowledged in , -
marriage manuals, it is not fol-V ' .1
lowed to its logical conclusion. 
We must begin to demand that if_[ if
a certain sexual position of tech- 
nique now defined as “standard” 7
is not mutually conducive to or-f ,.
gasm, then it should not longer be
defined as standard. New techni- 
ques must be used or devised’
which transform our current sex-‘ ’
ual exploitation.

Students who responded to the
Library Services questionnaire
distributed this past Fall by the
SG Library Services will be hap-
py to learn that their collective
,opinions and suggestions are re-
’ eiving serious consideration by
he Faculty Senate Library Com-
ttee and the Hillman Library
. rstaff. ' -
The SG Library" Services Com-
jmittee, headed by Lynda Cahan,
 _as recently finished correlating
jjinformation received from the

   
 

uestionnaire and is, reportedly,
lpiteé pleased ‘with the results.
!Data taken from some 1,114 re-
urned questionnaires was com-
,piled into a percentile study and
"published in a three page report
‘which has been forwarded to the
aforementioned authorities for
I urtlier examination.

;._Qut=stionnaire responses paint-
'_,ed the following statistical pic-
"ture:

— 95 per cent of the students
polled attend Pitt; the remaining
:6 per cent attend the various uni-
‘ ersities in Pittsburgh — CMU,
.-Mount Mercy, and Chatham.

 80 per cent of the replies came
‘om undergraduates; 20 per cent
“from graduate students.

cording to the following percen-
tages: Ground, eight per cent;
First, 29 per cent; Second, 28 per
cent; Third, 18 per cent; Fourth,
six per cent.

‘— Most students came to the li-
brary to study—49 per cent; 17 per
cent mainly use materials; 33 per
cent come for both purposes.

——Concerning the best method
of noise control, students were ra-
ther evenly divided among the
three methods suggested in the

questionnaire: 35 per cent want-
ed security officers; _26 per cent
favored delegating the respon-
sibility to the library staff; and
39 per cent felt that students
could do the most effective job.
It is interesting to note that many
of those replying considered

Lnoises to be no problem. Others
stated that students should be re_-

sponsible enough by this age to
respect others in a library setting.
A small. number responded rather
vehemently about the noise prob-
lem, especially on. the second
floor.

— An overwhelming majority of
replies favored opening t h e li-

brary earlier on Sundays — 78 per

cent. V

after 5 p.m.: 51 per cent, yes; 49
per cent, no. However, many of
those answering negatively indi-
cated they would use the library
until about 8 p.m.

— Although reading period is
finished, 66 per cent said they
would use the library until 1 a.m.,
while 34 per cent said they would

— The following percentages of
books were charged out by stu-
dents during the Fall term: 0 to 5,
60 per cent; 6 to 10, 19 per cent;
11 to 15, 10 per cent; l6_ to 20,
six per cent; over 20, five per cent.

—Students spent the following

‘quantity of hours. in the library

per week: 0 to five hours, 28 per
cent; six to 10 hours, 29 per cent;
11 to 15 hours, 20 per cent; 16 to
20 hours, nine per cent; over 20
hours, 14 per cent.

— 67 per cent ofthose replying
use other libraries_, with the ma-
jority of this group using Carne-
gie Public Library and CMU’s li-

brary. Many graduate students

use the respective libraries of
their schools (Scaife, Law Li-
brary, etc.); 33 per cent use the
Hillman Library exclusively.

-81 per cent of students poll-
ed indicated satisfaction with re-
serve bookroom policies. The 19
per cent who weren't happy with

- the present policies felt that stu-

d e n t s should b e permitted to
place an advance reserve for
books and also that more copies
of materials, especially for large
classes, should be available.

— Over 20 students expressed an

irterest in working on the Library

S arvices Committee.

— The following suggestions
were made most often by the stu-
dents on the question concerning
what could be done to curb mu-

Chancellor In Violation

 SG Backs ‘Alternatives’

By PEGGY ALLEN

Student Government has pass-
ed a bill supporting the principle
of freedom of speech as a result
of an incident involving Alterna-
tives and Central Printing, the
University Printing Office. Last
December, Central Printing‘ re-
fused to publish the fourth issue
of Alternatives because of cer-

tain “objectionable” words The_

Chancellor was asked to over-

rule this action, but refused. At

, the present time, Alternatives is
still waiting to be published.

The SG bill condemned Central

I Printing for having “acted in an

"S5 arbitrary and unwarranted man-

ner in refusing to print Alter-,
\ natives and in so ‘doing has at-'

tempted ‘to stifle freedom of
speech and has in fact denied ac-
cess to such a University facil-
ity."’ The bill also stated that the
Chancellor has “violated every
guarantee of due process in the

No Grades?

manner of providing appeal” by
his refusal to overrule Central
Printing.

..The bill resolved that the stu-
dent members of the Student Af-
fairs Committee of the Faculty
Senate raise‘ a question about the
Alternatives issue at the next
meeting and then prepare a reso-
lution “directing the Chancellor
to override the decision by Cen-

Printers Rebuked

tral Printing and direct them in
the future to adhere to Univer-
sity policy regarding the propri-
ety of University student publi-
cations.

The bill also advises that the

Chancellor‘ immediately direct‘

Central Printing to print Alterna-
tives, and should it refuse, “those
responsible shou-ld be dismissed
without delay.”

Student Records Office

By BRUCE LEVENSON

Contrary to common belief all
grades for courses last term
were "sent out on time. If you

1%‘-have not as yet received them it’s
your own fault— for changing ad-
dresses within the last year!

Please don’t blame the Regis-
trar’s Office (which is the pres-
ent name of the same old Student
Records Office). It seems that
this office got all the grades to-
gether and ordered Administra-
tion Systems (the old Data Cen-
ter) to mail them to the local ad-
dresses of the University stu-

dents. The Registrar feels that it
is more expedient to send grades
to local rather than home ad-
dresses. '

If your home and local address-.

es are one ‘and the same andhave 7

not changed within the past two
years, you were lucky enough to‘
receive your grades. Whether the

luck was good or bad depends on

your individual‘circumstances. ’
At any rate, Administrative Sys-

'tems somehow sent all of the

grade reports to last_year’s local
addresses. -

If you have not received grades
for last term, what happens now?

New Student Organizations

by VIRGINIA JOYCE
Staff News Writer

The SG Committee on Student

Organizations has r e c o g n i z e d
- three new groups on campus dur-
* . ‘ing its sessions of the Fall Term.

A s e r v i c e sorority affiliated

 g with Alpha Phi Omega, the men’s

service group, is one. N a m e d

  Gamma Sigma, the girls’ group,

according to acting president Sara
Williams has pledged itself to

it “serviceto self, community and

country.” Specifically their activ-
ities will include serving as host-

I esses for University -functions, as-
L sisting Alpha Phi Omega with the
I - SG book exchange and selling re-
' - freshments at the free movies. The

proceeds will go to charity.

 W Although normally a sorority,
 the group does not hold with the

rulings of the Panhellenic Coun-

.cil or follow traditional rushing

methods. Gamma Sigma is open

‘ to all interested girls; the only

requirement is the maintenance
of a 2.0. Interested girls can con-
tact Lynne Watson, pledge moth-

The second new organization is
in reality, the combination of two

‘old ones. The Council of Interna-

tional Relations and United Na-
tions Affairs (CIRUNA) is the
child of the merger of the Col-
legiate Council for the UN
(CCUN) and the International

“Relations Club (IRC). As outlin-
ed by President Arnold Gogol, the

goal of CIRUNA is to “endeavor .

to learn more about international
affairs, specifically the UN by

participating in various group ac- -

tivities. ’ ’

These activities include the
staging of mock political games
and symposia and conferences to
discuss foreignpaffairs ancl inter-
national issues.mT_he_ group works
closely with other colleges in the
Pittsburgh area.

Also on the agenda for CIRUNA-
are trips to universities in other
cities, such as ‘Washington and
Philadelphia. Interested persons
may contact~the advisor for the
group, Dr. Richard Cottam at his

office extension.

A third new group passed upon
by Diane Ulyon and her recogni-
tions committee was the Chinese
Language and Cultural Associa-
tion (CCIA). Membership is open
to undergraduate and graduate
students at the University‘ who are
presently studying Chinese lan-
guage and culture or have an in-
clination to do so.

The clubs goalsiare varied.
‘xxx! ‘

I-Recognized At University  

Along with clearing up miscon-
ceptionsnlabout the “yellow men-
ace,” CCIA is working to expand
the Chinese Department at ‘the
University by the addition of six
new courses.

A further function of the group
is to bring name authorities on

Chinese studies to the University. ' l

Since the Chinese program at Pitt
is the largest and most compre-

-hensive of all institutions within

a radius of 200 miles, “the Uni-
versity has an opportunity to make
a name for itself in this field,”
according to President Bill Le-
Lake. Students who wish-to join
CCIA should contact LeLake at

Dear Mr. Doan:

Business has cast itself in the
role of the doting parent,
scratching its corporate head
and asking: Now where have I
gone wrong? We on the other
side of the aptly-named
generation gap can readily
answer your question. The
question we can't answer—and
the one you must answer-is
more difficult: What does, and
what will, business do right?

The image that the corporate
world has created in the
academic world is a highly
negative one. Business, which
has sold us everything from
living space to living bras, has
been unable to sell itself.
Hopefully, our dialogue will
help dispel the-"business
myth"—-although all myths
are based on_varying degrees
of truth. » A -

And what exactly is this image?
It's that of a potential vehicle
for social change overcome by

its own inertia. Business has an ’

immense social power which is
exceeded only by its inadequate
social commitment. This

is~not to deny that many major
corporations are involved in
health research, agricultural
improvement, etc. But what we
question is whether business
is really carrying—or plans to
carry—its share of the

social burden.

A psychologist's association
test, for instance, would

yield such verbal gems as
"business" and "air pollution,"
"business" and "war- ~
profiteering,” "business" and
"planned obsolescence."

You yourself know only too
well the two-syllable
associative response generated
by "Dow Chemical." It is hard
for us to applaud a new
measles vaccine juxtaposed
with such immoralities.

Thus, many of the qualities we
associate with business are
contrary to our very way of life.
We have awakened from the
sleepy fifties and have begun

to challenge both political and
social tenets. Yet, while we
question our involvement in a
more-than—questionable war,
business apparently closesits
eyes and fills its wallets.

This is what troubles us.

As corny as it sounds, we do
hope to change the world.
Business, meanwhile, is trying
to change its image. But ~

in so doing, it is merely .
creating a battle of antithetica
stereotypes.

Thus unless it decides to give
itsev.lf—-a;a1cl not merely its image
~—-a major overhaul, business
can continue to write off a
growing segment of college
youth. Perhaps our dialogue will
help give the corporate world
the rectal kick it so desperately
needs.

Sincerely, ,2
T 7£~C./.<;./

Stan Chess
Journalism, Cornell

 

 

 

Forget your
image,
business...

Overhaul
yourself

Dear Mr. Chess: '

I agree with you that business
has done a wretched job of
selling itself. We tend to feel
that our role in developing the
highest living standards in the
world is self-explanatory, and
doesn't need much selling; and
we are so busy, and engrossed,
in what we're doing that we
don't really have time to "sell”
what we do.

Simple’ explanations of why a
company is producing a product
in the national interest don't
provide the answer to "selling"
business, as we at Dow are all
too well aware. The fact that

in thejudgment of our military
leaders the tactical use of
napalm is effectively saving lives
of our troops, and serves an
indispensible need in accelerat-
ing the end of a dirty and
unpopular war. . . the fact

that there simply is no truth to
reports of massive casualties
among Vietnamese women and
children resulting from napalm

. . . the fact that hundreds of
American doctors who have
volunteered their services in
Vietnamese hospitals report not
having a single civilian napalm
burn case, all are documented

_ facts blandly ignored by those

not responsive to reason. But
I have yet to hear criticism of
napalm from any returning
combat veteran.

Doesn't this really mean that
judgments should be made on
the basis of objective inquiry
and not unfounded opinion? -
Honestvdifferences will always-
arise. But a better understand-
ing of viewpoints and motives

~- will follow from objective

discussions. Business must sell
''itself’', not an image of itself.

It is from this perspective that
I think we should examine your
central question of “whether
business is really carrying—or

_ plans to carry—its share of the

social burden."

You are of course aware of
business’ direct involvement in
contemporary community
affairs through such programs
as those dealing with hard-core
unemployment, blight-area
housing, "civil rights, traffic
congestion, and pollution
problems.To me these programs
are evidence that business today
is assuming a much more active
social role. But this does not
answer two questions funda‘-,
mental to your inquiry: to what
extent should business—an
economic vehicle whose primary

.. commitment to the community -

lies in its economic functions-
assume social burdens: and
how can these social respon-

  "Friday; Jahuaiy*10,‘.'i969-THE'PI'1"i"NE‘WS-4P g _.

sibilities be discharged most
effectively?

Obviously all of society's .
institutions must assume some '
share of the burden ; there is ,
no sole responsibility. Can you
visualize a solution in which
only one segment of society
provides equal opportunity for
Negroes? —

I believe maximum long-term
profit growth is consistent
with, and in fact cannot be
‘achieved without, maximum

’ service to society. Maximum

service to society can be
achieved only through maximum
development of, and release of,
the ability of individuals.

And maximum release of

individual abilities brings about V 

maximum profit-growth.

Further, in my view, service
cannot be delivered best by
deliberately trying to be of

service. Service can more often‘ 

be achieved by indirection
than by any direct attempt to
be of service.

Business does so_ many things‘ »
right that I don't really see this
as an issue. We have developed
a system that the rest of the
world is frantically trying to A
copy. It is the worst system-
going except for all those other
systems. Business can't do
everything for everyone. of
course; it wasn't designed for
that. Like all of us, it should be
doing what it does best. As an
economic instrument, it can

best fulfill its social commitment "

by excelling in that respect.

Our nation is going’ through a - :
period of transition to new
policies and new philosophies.-

Your generation on the campus —  P

is doing us a real service by '
questioning our assumptions.
and by making us aware of-
hypocrisies and outmoded
parts of our systems and
institutions. You want to do

away with outmodedideologies, 4 .

and so do I. As new values are -
accepted which emphasize the
role of the individual in society
today, and new relationships g.
develop between the public and
private sector of society, then.
more realistic answers will be
found as to how business, in
harness with government and _
education, can share the social

‘burden by providing real—-

rather than iIlusory—service.

It was the same old story. The hoopsterssimply couldn’t put the

respectable 11.5 scoring aver-
age. Caldwell is regarded as the
best outside shooter on the team,
but the Indiana-bred backcourt
ace hit on only 3 of 18 shots.

“If "he took two bad’ shots out

of 18, I’d be surprised,” explain-
ed Ridl. “He’s a forty something
per cent shooter.” Ridl, however,
didn’t.,,_seem to mind that Cald-
well took so many shots despite
such a poor night from the floor.

“I just couldn’t believe he
wouldn’t hit,” said Ridl. “When
he missed so many shots I figur-
ed he wouldn’t miss many more.
I expected him to hit about four
straight. I couldn’t believe it un-
til the very end.”

Leading scorer and rebounder
Mike Patcher was also a disap-
pointment. Patcher managed only‘
one lay-up against Lafayette and
was completely outplayed under
the boards. But most noticeable

Casimir Myslinski, the sparkling new Athletic Director, walked into the

out of his mouth was a word that has kept man frustrated since hair covered

Myslinski has the right idea, the right incentive and ambition. But the word “If”
has been a lingering skeleton in the University’s closet.

When Myslinski was introduced at a special press luncheon in the Webster Hall
Hotel over the Christmas break, he said the biggest problem facing him was “to get
people at Pitt to think of victory.”

Myslinski checked past sports records. “Your last winning season in football
was 1963, and in basketball, it was ’63-64,” he pointed out to the hometown press media.

“This is not aﬂgood atmosphere for a winning
kind of sports,” he added. “And I intend to be
major league.”

Myslinski, 48, a past head of the Department of
Physical Education at the Air Force Academy, was
a member of a search committee to find a new foot-
ball coach after Dave Hart resigned under pressure
Nov. 25, 1968. An associate of Chancellor Wesley
Posvar at West Point, and Air Force, he received a
letter from Dr. Posvar Dec. 19, offering him the job
of AD. .

' Myslinski accepted by telephone, Dec. 21

A 1944 West Point graduate, he was an All-
American center at Army under coach Earl “Red”
'Blaik. Born in Stuebenville, Ohio, he graduated with
a B.S. in engineering and subsequently earned the
M.A. in phys-ed from Teachers’ College, Columbia.

He is a sturdy 5-10, with jet black hair, and 
looks like an Army drill sergeant though he at one '
time held the military positions of Commander
of an F;l04 Tactical Fighter Squadron and chief of
a U. S. military training mission in Saudi Arabia.

His first important task was to remedy Pitt’s ills. “We’re going on an order for
RIGHT NOW, not next spring or fall. “I don’t blame the people” for abandoning sports

«here. “Our won-lost record is not what we want. With help, we can reverse that trend,”
he has said. '

“I am going to do everything possible to change the rules to put Pitt on top in all
sports,” Myslinski said. He had one reservation, however‘, as he stayed away from the
question of the school’s stringent academic policy.

“I’m going to leave the academics up to the academic people,” he said. “I’m, not in
a position to say we are going to reduce the language requirement; We are going to do
something about it.” ‘

He added, however,’ that he respected the integrity of the University. He sought a
coach “who would not disregard the rules, or get the University in trouble.”

When he accepted the position, Myslinski left a flourishing California Real Estate
Business, where his boss “hated to see” him leave‘. Myslinski does not have a contract
per se, but as he put it,” “you have to sign a contract to get on the payroll.”

Cagers Can End Skein,
But Geo. Washington
Has Tal(l)ent(ed) Crew

by JERRY L. GRUEBEL

When the hoopsters face George Washington tomorrow night
they will be up against a lot of talent, namely Bob and Mike

Tallent.

The two brothers make George Washington a power in the East.
Bob, a senior, is one of the top ten scorers in the country with a better
than 27 points per game scoring average. Mike, a sophomore, has
contributed better than 17 points per game. ’

“They’ll be quite a problem,”
said basketball coach Buzz Ridl
aware of George Washington’s
high scoring brother duo,"“butI
don’t know what we’re going to be
able to do about them.”

The two backcourt aces will
give the cager guards a lot of
work with their speed and out-
side shooting. Ridl is expected to
‘use sophomore Billy Downes to
contain one of the Tallents.

' “Billy adds good speed to the
line-up,” explained Ridl, “I
might very well use him a great
deal against George Washington.”

Downes contributed 10 points
in the losing cause to Lafayette,
and stole the ball three times from
his opponents. The sophomore
guard saw his most action of the
young season in that game.

However, the cagers biggest
problem tomorrow night might not
be the Tallent brothers, but shoot-
ing. The hoopsters have shot at
below a 37 per cent field goal
rate, far below Ridl’s pre-season
expectations of 42 per cent, a mark
which the ex-Westminster mentor
insists is good enough to produce
awinner. '

“What can I tell you ? said
Ridl with an almost forced smile.

“We hope to shoot better against
George Washington.”

The Tallent brothers are'aver-
aging only 15 points less per
game than the entire cager team
this season, so the cagers will have
to shoot, and shoot well, to win.

Ridl,, who produced Westmins-
ter teams that over a. twelve year
period won better than 70 per cent
of their games, has watched this
year’s cage team drop six consecu-
tive games after jumping off to a
2-1 mark. 1

After a month lay-off for exams and the holidays, Dave
Adams’matmen swing back into action tomorrow afternoon as
they play host to a highly touted Navy squad at the Fitzgerald
Field House at 2:00 pm. ' . . -

Tomorrow’s meet will be the first for the grapplers since, Decem,
Eber 7, when they pulled out a big win in the Ohio State quadrangular
meet in Columbus, Ohio. _ " ""' I 9

In going against Navy, the
grapplers will be facing “the
best team in the East” according
to Coach Adams, who was an as-
sistant at the Naval Academy be-
fore coming here last season. Ac-
cording to Adams, an independant
poll conducted- by an Eastern
newspaper has rated Navy num-
ber one in the East.

“We’re definitely the under-
he explained, _
“but we’re going to have to fight
them allthe way down the line.”

In last year’s meeting between
the two schools, Navy captured a
33-2 win, with the only varsity
points coming in a draw between

explained Adams. ‘ .. A V 
Coming off the injured list and
slated to make his first (varsity
appearance will be sophomore
heavyweight Ralph Cindrich. Cin-
drich, ‘undefeated as a freshman
last season in dual meets and _a
two-time state runner-up" in high
school, will have his work cut out
.for him in his varsity debut,
however,.as he goes against last
,year’s Eastern heavyweight
champion Mark Kane.  1

Another new face in the line'-
up tomorrow will be Ron Levan-
dowski at 167. Levandowski- is_z-
sophomore from Erie. ' '

Due to the injury to Case, Adam
was forced to shuffle his line-up
considerably for tomorrow’s en‘-
counter..Larry Cuba will move
down from’137 to 130, while‘IPa
Lavery, normally at. 152, willlgij

sophomores, .go’ into the Navy

“‘We wrestled real well in -the’
quadrangular,” noted Adams.
“We started to take charge. We
took the fight to somebody else-
and had more confidence. We
had the attitude that we’re going

“In the first match this year
with Michigan, we had six sopho-

Reopen Season

Cubs Meet Point Park

by BILL NAAB

“It’s like a new season,” stated freshman basketball coach

;'Tim Grgurich. His frosh squad hasn’t met any opposition in

’_.over- a month, and Grgurich believes that his team will display
fine form despite the recent inactivity.

 The Cubs oppose the Point Park freshmen Saturday night at 6:30
gin the Field House. In the Cubs only game of the season December 3,
H. they also met the Point Park frosh. In that game, the Cubs struggled
Ito a slim 6 point halftime lead. However, in the second half the team
really came alive and poured in 55 points, winnimg easily 85-63.

. , In that game Point Park was led by Joe Muldowney who drilled
‘in 30 points, mostly from the side. Only one other-player, Randy
,-Brenner, scored in double figures.

,_ Another player who should help the Little Pioneers will be Paul
5Bloom. The 6’5” Bloom is a Duquesne transfer and a former Round-
.ball Classic performer from Peabody High. He was not eligible
for the previous encounter andhis presence should help their inside
I game, although the Pioneers seem to depend basically on their outside
(shooting. . ‘
Grgurich commented that his squad played well in their first
-contest and he expects another well-balanced attack from them. Rod
Schoon was the only scholarship player who did not score in double
.. figures in the opener. However, the 6’6” Schoon did make 5lassists.
"Grgurich remarked, “He’ll shoot more. He just felt that-there were
(other guys who were open.” ’ '

 ' Grgurich mentioned that learning to play together — the idea of
team work — is the fundamental purpose of freshman basketball. More-
~'o_ver, he intends to instill this idea of teamwork not only into the
1- scholarship players, but also the walk-ons.

S ‘-‘The Walk-ons are doing a real good job, and they are given, the
 ame opportunity as the other players. They’ve been working real hard.”
,, “Grgurich also mentioned that his squad will again go with the
:-(deliberate 3-2 offense, since varsity basketball coach Buzz Ridl has
initiated the style throughout the program. Utilizing,it at Westmins-
-ter Ridl won 216 games and lost only 91. _

 -Grgurich commented on this. “He’s used it in the past and with
ithat percentage, he’ll continue to use it.” The squad will also con-
I-front Point Park with a man to man defense. ' ‘

f  After Saturday night’s game against the Little Pioneers, Grgurich
ill have his hands full during the rest of the month. Monday the
subs will take on the tough Robert Morris Colonials,

The Pitt swimming team.

faces its roughest opponent so
far this year tomorrow. The
tankmen will meet the Buck-
nell Bisons at Trees P011 at
2:00 p.m.

The squad enters this meet with
a 1-1 record. Before the semester
break. the mermen downed In-

diana State of Pennsylvania, 63-
50, and lost to Temple 57-45.

Bucknell is a perennial swim-

of the last six years, the Bisons
have captured the Middle At-

that Bucknell ever had, Robert
Latour.

Last season, the Bisons crushed
Pitt, 73-40. Only four members of
that squad graduated, while there
are twelve returning lettermen
this year.

Russell says, “I know the pres-
tige and reputation that Bucknell
has built in swimming and this
year’s team will be no exception.”
He expects most of the team’s
strength will lie in the freestyle
sprints, and the butterfly and’
backstroke events.

Several of the current Bison
tankmen hold the school records
in various events. Also, many of
them currently possess ‘the Con-
ference records.

Coach Russell sums up his feel-
ings by saying, “The team is a
great group of dedicated athletes,
who know that they have a repu-
tation to uphold and they are con-
tinually ‘working to better the
team and themselves.”

As in his first season, last year,
varsity coach Bill Grand, has en-
tered the swimming campaign with

._._a, disadvantage. “We still have the
-.pr,oblem: on the varsity of not-.

having enough swimmers,” he
commented. "While other teams‘
can limit their boys to just two
events, we must use most of our
men in three events.”

Grant is concerned about this
situation in tomorrow’s meet. He
explained, “They have many
good freestylers and they will be
able to space them so they can
receive a maximum rest.”

Although last year’s contest was
a complete runaway, Grant is con-
fident that the drubbing will not
be repeated. “This time, we have
more men especially in the free-
style and diving events,” he re-
marked.

During the semester break, the M

tankmen practiced at their homes.
‘They also began team practice
Sunday at Trees Pool. Grant be-
lieves that-. this (year’s team is
about as dedicated a group as he

has ever had the opportunity to.

coach.

Because of all these factors,
Grant says, “I think we’ll be able
to give the Bisons a real run for
their money.”

Meanwhile, the freshmen un-
der the coaching of Jerry Snyder,
are preparing for their first meet
of the season next" Wednesday
against California State College.

Rebuilding Gymnasts At Temple

Gymnastics, a sport that gets very little fan
attention, is nevertheless getting a great
amount of dedication from it’s coach, Warren
Neiger, and it’s group of young gymnasts.

Only a club last year made up of freshmen and
two seniors, it has now become a varsity sport of
all sophomores and one junior. The team now has
some scholarships and will begin to recruit new men
to strengthen the team. Meanwhile, Neiger must
work with a very young and inexperienced team.

Neiger is banking on seven versatile gymnasts
to carry the team through tomorrow’s meet. Lowell
Meek, high scorer at the Army meet with a 9.1,
is the team’s strong floor exercise man and also
works on the still rings and horizontal bar. Cap-
tain Dave Andrew, not "eligible for the Army meet,
will take over the floor exercise event, while also
working on the long horse and the side horse. Phil
Lilly’s best event is the side horse and he won this

event against Army.

Another good long and side horse man is Mike
Beatty, who also works the parallel bars. Junior
Hoy Wong is the still ring specialist who has “im-
proved greatly and has pleased the coaches.” '

The “best still ring man right now” though is
Jim Bilec. Rounding out the squad is Bernie Jes-
iolwski, whose potential in the floor exercise is
exemplified by his tumbling skills. Neiger also has
high praise for freshman Joe Gracik, a state champ
on the side horse in high school.

“Our loss to Army, tomorrow’s meet with Tem-
ple and our later meeting with Penn State are our
roughest meets,” explains Neiger. “We can possi-
bly beat West Virginia, Kent State, Syracuse and
Slippery Rock.” If the gymnasts do, it will be a
very happy development for all those involved with
gymnastics.

Six   Soph Thinclads Starting

Early in C.Y.O. Invitational  

by ED CONLEY

Track coach Jim Banner
will get a look at some of the
talent on his squad a bitsoon-
er than expected, tonight, six
members of the team will be com-
peting in the C.Y.O. National In-

been open until next Saturday,
when the thinclads will go against
Kent State at the Field House.

The group that will see action
tonight is an all sophomore line-
up, stars of last year’s suc-
cessful freshman squad.

Leading the list will be Jerry
Richey, holder of many frosh ~-
records, who will begin his quest
of the varsity stardom that is ex-
pected.

He’ll be running a strange race,
however. The distance will be »
three miles at Washington; Rich- .
ey would normally run two miles.

“This time of the_ year,_I
guess, the three-mile is good for
him,” Banner pointed out.‘ “It’s
good for his conditioning.”

Richey may not be ready for the
race, though. He sprained an an-
kle a few days ago. “But, it is
coming along pretty good,” the
coach reassured,’ ., . I

the “big”-narr'ies“ from last win-

But, the coach has few com-
plaints whenrhe speaks of his
other entry in the meet, the four-
‘man—_ mile relay team. Wally
Swiger, John Aiken, Rudy Huf-
nagle, and Smitty Brown. form the
strong unit which Banner classi-
fies as “a fine team.”

Three of these runners were on

the frosh relay-team last" year;

' the new member is John Aiken, a

“delightful surprise” to his coach.

Banner a_has confidence in the

sophs who will compete tonight;

“Certainly, they are strong points,

. ‘he said. “They’re in-the type of

events" that you expect to be in-
vited into. They’re-a fine team.

“These boys are all good com-

They’ll -be up against the best,

top athletes from this side of the

 Do You Like Being 
Laughed At, Wes?  I
by

Roy Jacobs Sport Editor 

YIIIIIIIIIIZIIIIIIIjIiIIIIIII-I'. Q

People all across the country are laughing at_Pitt, Dr.
Posvar. Football playersfcoaches, and writers are laughing,
too, Mr. Myslinski. Students are snickering and smiling. 
.\ And Dave Hart and John Michelosen are having the biggest. V‘
| horse laughs of all. '

i, . So have a good laugh, Dr. Posvar and Mr. Myslinski. --
‘Thejoke’sonyou. * ' ‘B "
. ‘With Frank Kush changing his mind about taking the
E Pitt football job, the University is more than ever the laugh‘-_

ing stock of college football. And probably in serious trouble,
too, when it comes to finding another head coach. ‘

‘- Is there a college coach left in the country who would

! still want the Pitt job after the dispersions 

——if unsaid—cast upon it by Kush? Certainly 

\ there is no one better than, or even as good ’I‘

as, Kush available. A_ny_one taking the job T

\ now would surely have tremendous feelings
Io: embarrassment.

And the players. What about them? They .
\_ were sky-high for Kush. Many had already ‘
started getting themselves in shape. No
‘ other coach is going to be nearly as appeal-
ing following these circumstances. . 
\.

But why did“ Kush suffer his “change of heart”? The
given reasons are that ‘his family interests were too strong
and that his coaching staff didn’t want tovcome with him.
As many ,“given” reasons are_, these are a bunch of baloney. V T

For one, Kush hails from Western Pennsylvania and has
a large family in the area. In addition, he’s done a good deali if
of recruiting here. -Moving back couldn’t possibly be TH-AT ‘Z "
bad, especially with increased salary. - ' » 

For the other, the fact that the staff wouldn’t come in,‘gf' I"
itself isn’t_ sufficient. A good, tough, winning head coach. r»
with good connections, many opportunities, and better sal-
. aries to offer can attract top-notch assistants.‘ g

‘ More likely, Kush’s staff talked him out of the Pitt job. 

, . after conversing with various other coaches and officials at

-Pitt is a graveyard for coaches. -Ask Hart and Michelo-

He got out before he got in. Will we learn? It’s doubtful. «

' Myslinski is now charged with filling the’ position -with .
“an extremely well-qualified man in the near future.” Just.

of similar ability to come to Pitt. . _ V -

No more status quo,_ please. Atgthis point it would prob-5

No more wishy-washiness either, please. No more con—  ,

Engineering and Science at IBM

“The interdisciplinary  
environment keeps you

“Working in data processing today pretty much
means you work in a broad spectrum of tech-
noIogies,”says Nick Donofrio.

An Associate Engineer at IBM, Nick is a’
1967 graduate in Electrical Engineering.
He's using his technical background

, to design circuits forcomputer
memory systems.

“Circuit design used to be a narrow
job,” he says. “Today it can take you
into the front yard of half a dozen
different fields. In myjob, for example,
I work with systems design engineers,
chemists, physicists, metallurgists,
and programmers.” -

Nick describes a hypothetical case
history:A“A memory systems man
comes to me with memory circuit
requirements. Before I can start
designing the circuit,'l go‘to seea
physicist. He helps me select an
appropriate technology for the
monolithic circuit.

“As the design develops, I work with a I
test group and also check back with the ‘
systems and semiconductor people to make
sure I'm on the right track.” ~

Keeping up
The interdisciplinary environment at IBM helps

you keep up to date technologically. As Nick
puts it, “You're constantly exposed to what's

IBM needs technical graduates to work in
research, design and development, manufactur-
ing, product test, field engineering, and space
and defense projects. We also need technical
people in programming and marketing.
