 

Students aren't
fazed by riot
near campus

Zachariah Blott

News Editor

Though news of a riot along Forbes Avenue last Sunday
night may have tainted the image of Pitt and Oakland for
some new students, many say they are still not afraid to walk
the campus at night or attend the dance club where the inci-
dent took place.

Around 11:00 that night, over 1,000 high school—aged
teens began spilling onto Forbes Avenue, causing tiaﬁic
problems and getting into ﬁghts’ while trying to get into a hip-
hop dance party at Club Laga, according to Zone 6 Police
Corrmiander Edward Kelly.

Police clashed with the youths, causing some to allege
the officers used intimidation instead of reason because
many of the youths were black Pitt students interviewed said
that upset them more than the actual riot. _

Despite the furor that night, only two people were anest-
ed, and no injuries were reported.

Students also reacted to statements made by
Commander Kelly in yesterday’s Pitt News. Kelly admitted
police reacted stemly because many of the teens were black

Freshmen class 14 percent
larger than last year's class

Brett Taylor
For The Pitt News

If it looks like there are a lot more stu-
dents filling the halls of Pitt this year, it's
because the largest freshman class in the
University's 210—year history has arrived.

As of Aug. 21, 3,227 students had
paid deposits to the University to ensure

placement in the freshman class. This is up

from 2,650 last year, despite a tuition hike
of 4.5 percent for in—state students, and 5.5
percent for out—of—state students.

Pitt spokesman Ken Service said the
increase in students is due largely to the
high quality of a Pitt education and the low
corresponding price tag.

"It reﬂects that we're recognized for
providing a good value for the money,"
Service said.

Last week, Pitt was named to both
Money Magazine's "best buys in higher
education," and US. News‘ "best values in
higher education." Service said Pitt was
the only Pennsylvania university to be
named to both.

In October 1994, the University initi-
ated the "Toward the 21st Century" pro-
gram to increase enrollment, attract stu-
dents from out-of—state, and move toward
higher academic standards. Since then,
Pitt's admission policies have been stiff-
ened and the University has sought to
attract more students from outside
Pennsylvania.

Because of that program, the number
of applications has increased as well as the
number of students accepted, according to
Betsy Porter, director of admissions and
ﬁnancial aid.

The number of students accepted into
the Honors College has also increased in
line with the University's plan for higher
academic standards, Service said.

This year, a total of 580 freshmen
were accepted into the Honors College, an
increase of 130 from last year's 450. The
freshman members of the Honors College
must be in the top 10 percent of their high
school graduating class and have an aver-
age score of 1,320 on their SAT.

REACTION

and the officers on the scene feared some
were in gangs.

Students seemed more upset by Kelly’s
remarks than they were about the incident.

“That just appalled me,” said sopho-
more Matt Novak

“It pisses me off that he said that,” said
Erin Costello, a freshman.

-Sophomore Marvin Dodds said he
thinks it is unfortrmate what Kelly said, but
he isn’t surprised.

“What "do you expect from cops?” he
said. “You always hear about this. I don’t
expect them to change anytime soon.”

But even students who have only heard
exaggerated rumors about the incident say
they are not worried by what they’ve heard

Some rumors circulating the campus
are that the riot broke out when white
supremacists stormed a popular rap act at the
club; another is ﬂiat police let their dogs
chase the individuals away ﬁom the scene;
still another is that a shooting occuned inside
the club and that many in the crowd were
armed All of these allegations are false.

Ron Levick, the club’s owner, said he
feared the rumors would put him out of busi-
ness. While manning a booth outside the
William Pitt Union Tuesday, Levick said he
was approached by many students curious
about what really happened. Almost every
one passed along some variation of a nnnor
they’d heard second- or thirdhand

Levick said he planned not to host any
more under-21 parties because of the riot,

but many students say the incident did not
wony them.

“All three of my brothers went [to Pitt] ,”
said freshman Scott VV1sniewski, “and as
much as I’ve been around here, I still think
it’s a safe area”

However, Novak said he thinks some
freshmen may be leery of walking around
Oakland after the riot because the incident
happened before they got a clear picture of
what Oakland is typically like at night.

“If it was my ﬁrst year here, [the riot]
would be a bad image right when I got here,”
said Novak “But it doesn’t dim the luster of
the University in my mind,” he added with a

. laugh.

But many of the freshmen were not
alarmed by the situation and said ‘they
already had an understanding of the area
from their visits to the University.

Freshman Sharma Shwartz still feels
safe walking around Oakland, even after
witnessing some of Sunday night’s activities
from Forbes Hall.

She saw between 60 and 100 kids stam-
peding down Forbes Avenue from her
friend’s dormitory, located near Laga, and
assumed the clusters of running kids weren’t
a common occurrence.

“It doesn’t make me feel any less safe,”
said Shwartz. .

When asked how she felt about the
ﬁghts that broke out along Forbes, she said,
“There could be ﬁghts all over the place, so
that’s not a big deal.”

Costello said she feels the same way,
even though she heard rumors that some of
the kids had guns with them.

“It’s just what I heard,” she said, “but I
don’t actually believe it.”

NORDENBERG

“Ten years ago, people's attitudes were
characterized by some apprehension with
respect to city life. Today, more people are
realizing that if you want to learn about liv-
ing in the 21st century, the city is the place to
be.” i

Describing his day is diﬂicult he said,

and explaining how his actions inﬂuence the
daily ﬁves of thousands of students is ‘even
harder. ‘ '
“The beauty of a job like this one is that
there really is no such thing as a typical day,”
he said. “In a place this big, this complex,
and with so many different things going on,
and with the level of enrollment and respon-
sibility, variety is the spice of life.”
. While walking down the cool, dark cor-
ridor toward his ofﬁce in the Cathedral, one

expects the door marked "107" to open into
a dungeon or wine cellar. The cozy reception
area behind that door is misleading as well.

Waiting in that room to start the inter-
view, the three Pitt News reporters heard his
voice echo from an arch leading to a hallway
and ending at his inner-oﬁice — presumably
a large one. Instantly, he shot by that arch on
his way to a diiferent room with a quick
“Hello,” a wave of his hand, and a ﬂash of
his blue and gold striped tie -—— the old school
colors, not the new. A

?‘Be right with you,” the voice said.

A moment later he emerged with Pitt
spokesman Ken Service at his side. The
chancellor grinned and introduced himself.
“Hello. I’m Mark Nordenberg,” he said
humbly, as though the man who holds Pitt’s

futureinhishands was astrangertothethree
students.

Having several other interviews to oom— .

plete that day, he quickly escorted the writers
toward his private oﬁice, easily the size of
three Cathedral classrooms, a massive
peninsula extending from the base of the
Cathedral. '

Some cushioned chairs surrounded a
rug at the front of the enormous room, while
a meeting table ﬁt for the Joint Chiefs-of-
Staff rested in the middle of the office.

At the end was his desk, also ominous.
The Heinz Chapel loomed outside the ofﬁce
on the left, the Stephen Foster Memorial on
the right.

The grand room could be a metaphor
for Nordenberg himself; though not immedi-

T ately visible to the average Pitt student, it

keeps watch over them as they come and go

to class in Pitt’s iconic building.

Nordenberg sat down at the monolithic
meeting table and rattled through a list of
people he’d already met with for hours that
day: Provost James Maher, who supervises
student life and academics, Senior Vice-
Chancellor Thomas Detre, who oversees the
Health Sciences departments, and Bob
Cranmer, chair of the Allegheny County
Commissioners.

“This evening is lantern night, and then
I’ll be on the ﬁrst plane to Hanisburg tomor-
row morning,” he added. “Before the week
is out, I’ll have other staif meetings, the foot-
ball kick off lunch, and the ﬁrst game of the
year.”

He said much of his time is spent repre-
senting Pitt’s interests at various political
functions, in academic organizations and on

us.
“On the business side, I’ll get into
updates on how things are going with the
new food service with the renovations to the
eating facilities on the ground ﬂoor of the
Cathedral, and — now that we have a mass
of students moving through them — when

' the doors will be reopened on the front of the

Cathedral.”
Asked to deﬁne his role on campus in
one sentence, Nordenberg said it was impos-

. sible.

, “You can’t put it into one sentence,” he
said. “I think that a chancellor is ﬁrst a leader
of the campus community, a person whose
most’ important contributions include bring-
ing together other talented individuals to
nourish the University.” e

He said some undergraduates may not

realize the implications those things have on
their lives. 4

“But actually, in the long haul, the kind
of support that might be attracted from them
are some of the things that determine pretty
directly what your potential is to provide top
quality programs, facilities and experiences

‘ to people.

That is a very important part of my job.”

Two killed in Pisburgh’s east end this week

Across the Nation

PITTSBURGH — A man was shot to
death yesterday morning. No arrests
have been reported in the death of 20-
year-old Todd Snyder. It’s the second
fatal shooting in the city’s east end
this week. George Taylor of
Wilkinsburg was killed Sunday night.
Police have issued a warrant for the
arrest of John Riley, accused of killing
Taylor.

PHILADELPHIA — Philadelphia
police have arrested six suspects in
connection with a shooting that left
ﬁve wounded last night. Police say the
clash between two Asian gangs erupt-

   

ed around midnight. The ﬁght was
sparked when a member of one group
made disparaging remarks about a
rival gang member’s sister.

Five victims were gunned down
and rushed to local hospitals, four of
whom have since been treated and
released. None of the injuries are
believed to be life—threatening.

The six arrested were charged
with assault, reckless endangerment,
weapons violations and conspiracy.

SARASOTA, Fl.—— A discrimination
lawsuit against the Motel Six chain
has now been opened to thousands of
plaintiffs.

A federal judge has allowed the

suit to proceed as a class action. It
claims that the company’s policy is to
discriminate against blacks and other
minorities.

The original lawsuit was filed in
1996 by two black sheriff's detectives
who say they were denied a room at a
Punta Gorda, Fla., Motel Six because
of their race.

Twenty-two affidavits have been
ﬁled by current and former Motel Six
employees and other people who say
they were refused rooms, overcharged
or otherwise mistreated during their
stays.

The company denies the charges
and says it will appeal the judge’s rul-
ing.

FRESHMEN 

According to the admissions oﬂice,
25 percent of Pitt's freshmen ranked in the
top 10 percent of their high school class
and 82 percent in the top two—ﬁfths.

Pitt's boosted recruitment elforts over
the past few years have paid off in recruit-
ing out—of—state students as well. This year,
20 percent of incoming freshmen are from
out of state, even though most out-of-state
students pay $6,764 more than in-state
students.

According to Porter, the number of
out-of—state applications has increased sig-
nificantly over the past three years, from
1,963 in 1994 to 3,952 this year.

"The deans from all of Pitt's colleges
presented their proposed emollment num-
bers," Porter said. "They raised the num-
ber [of students] as much as they could
without compromising academic stan-
dards."

Service said even with the expected
drop in enrollment during the add/drop
period, it will still be a record year for the
number of students on campus.

Despite the large class size and the
volume of tuition dollars rolling in as a
result, the enrollment has caused problems
for some of the freshmen looking for on-
campus housing. The increase in freshman
enrollment has resulted in a shortage of
University housing. More than 200 stu-
dents have been squeezed into the living
rooms of suites in Sutherland Hall, adding
two to three people to each suite.

We need to pay attention
to the decision makers

We are very happy to print today ‘what we hope will be
the first of many interviews with Pitt’s top banana,
Chancellor Mark Nordenberg. He is responsible for every
decision that affects the operation of the University, and we,
as students and faculty, should pay careful attention to what
he does.

It seems that not many people know or care about that,
though, and that is scary. Students invest several years and as
much as $60 thousand in this school, and tenured professors
invest much of their lives here. With that in mind, we carmot
afford to be ignorant. So why does it happen?

People don’t care about things they don’t know about. If
you don’t know what goes on"m the meetings and the ofﬁces
of our administrators, youprobably don’t give it any thought.
But when you hear that your tuition is going up, or that your

‘ department is being trimmed, you’re suddenly outraged.

We need to take action before things get that far. We have
to pay attention to the meetings, even if they seem boring,
because every once in a while something important comes up
of which we need to take notice.

And sometimes, we need to scream about it.

Nordenberg said the chancellor’s position is a visible
one. It is good that he feels that way, and we hope hewill con-
tinue to show us what he is doing and tell us what he thinks
is important. But we need to watch, and to listen.

Keep informed about your city and campus. Listen. Talk

- to people. Read. A good newspaper gives its readers infor-

mation to help them live their lives. We will do our best to do
that. Take the information, read it and think about it.

When you hear about something that you don’t like,
there are many things you can do about it. Call the SGB and
tell them what you think Talk to student leaders of other
groups, too, because they represent students’ interests to the
administrators, as do the Opinions pages of this newspaper.
Write a letter to the editor and thousands of people will read
it, including the administration.

It’s our school as much as the chancellor’s. We can’ all

work together to make Pitt better every day.

A 1600 SAT isn't everything

Kris Kissel

Oplnlons Edltor

SAT scores are up, but that
doesn’t mean a damn thing.

According to yesterday’s
Pittsburgh Post—Gazette, the
national average scores. of
high school students taking the
SAT exam has increased to its
highest in 26 years, and the
story suggests that this means
the freshman classes this year
are smarter than in previous
years. But the stats do not real-
ly mean that.

The SAT is not an intelli-
gence test. It is, for the most
part, a test of certain knowl-
edge. '

The math section tests
basic knowledge of algebra
and geometry — knowledge
that every high school gradu-
ate should have encountered. I
actually see no reason that
anyone who has gotten as far
as trigonometry or precalculus

I should be unable to score any-

thing less than an 800 on the
math section, though people
do make mistakes. I must
have, too, because I left that
test confident of a perfect
math score but, alas, I fell
short. But I know I am capable
of answering every question in
that section, given enough
time to really think about the
questions when I’m not under
pressure, and I think every-
body else entering college
probably is as well.

But the verbal section is a
different story. The reading
comprehension is more or less
accessible to the power of rea-

son, but the vocabulary stuff,
which comprises 75 percent of
that section, is a lot more eso-
teric. I can’t pronounce some
of those words, and have never
seen one or two before, so I
certainly don’t know what
they all mean. They pick
uncommon words to see how
much you know, and chances
are, you don’t know all of
them either. Unlike the math
section, where you can try to
reason it through, or at the
very least just substitute the
multiple-choice answers until
you find one that works, the
verbal section does not lend
itself to reasoning. The power
of intelligence is almost use-
less when it comes to that part
of the test.

Most people don’t seem to
realize this. In fact, I have
heard many people wallow in
self-pity about how “stupid”
they must be because of their
low SAT scores. It’s really a
shame that people think this,
because it’s not true, and I
know of a few who have real-
ly taken their low scores to
heart. Some never even
applied to college after taking
the test.

of the College Board, which
runs the SAT exams, calls the

tests “valuable indicators” of .

My total scores were higher
than a number of my class-
mates, all of whom, I am sure,
were much better prepared for
college than I was.

I didn’t have good study
skills. I didn’t understand time
management. And I really did-
n’t care to make an effort to
learn them. Some of my high
school classmates with lower
SAT scores did know those
things. That helped them get
better grades in high school,
and of those I kept in touch
with, it has helped most of
them to get better grades in
college as well.

I eventually learned many
of these skills. But it took a
longtime and my grades suf-
fered early on because of it. I
had lots of trouble with classes
that were not my forte (math),
and I ‘ended up changing
majors because of it. «

grades made me realize that I
was not going to be a great
candidate for med school. I
panicked, decided to change
my major to something I was
good at, and took up mathe-
matics. A -

Technophobia keeps us from being smart consumers

Henry J.
Mason

The girl at the Blockbuster checkout
counter looked perplexed.

“DVD? What’s that?” ' ' ’

“Uh, well, it’s like a CD with vide
on it, you know.” I wasn’t about to get into
the intricacies of blue-laser technology,
MPEG compression or multiple-layer
discs at this point.

“Oh, you mean like laserdiscs.”

_ “Well, um, sort of.” Like a truck is
like a sports car, maybe. “So, do you have
any plans of renting them sometime in the
future?”

“No, not as far as I know.”

This performance was repeated, with
a few changes, at West Coast Video. In
fact, everywhere I went, it was the same
story, with one notable exception —— a
small store that also happened to be one of
the few places in town that rents
laserdiscs. Even there, tl1ey’ll only be
starting to rent them in a‘ couple of
months. Maybe.

DVD, for the uninitiated, is a technol-
ogy that puts compressed video and audio
on a standard-sized CD; a single-sided,
single-layer DVD can hold 133 minutes
of video” and six—charmel CD—quality
audio. In any case, most people I have
talked to have never heard of DVD tech-
nology, let alone seen it. Which is a pity,
since it is far better than any other video

format, including laserdisc. “

be advancing at such a Iet a|one The digital replacement of
breakneck pace that even seen it actors could, according to

someone who reads Popular
Science religiously, let alone
the average consumer, will

be overwhelmed by the changes. We have

24x CDROMS. HDTV should be coming
in this fall. The high-end standard now
consists of 266 megahertz Pentiums. The
scientists at NASA ran out of places to
race their dune buggies, so now they do it
on Mars. Bill Clinton acts in a movie
(Contact) without knowing about it
(something I would be more than happy to
do, in case anybody’s ﬁlming). The list
goes on. S

So, where does this get us? Despite
the rapidly increasing level of technical
sophistication in the average Western life-
style-, most people have a painfully limit-
ed knowledge of how their newtoys actu-
ally work, or even the old toys, for that

some, destroy the craft of

. ﬂ acting. The intemet corrupts
our kids, they say. The space
program wastes billions of tax dollars.
Television gets bigger and better, ‘with
more and more charmels, so you can
choose from more dreck than ever before.
What is being overlooked is that tech—
nology is already outpacing public educa-
tion. The reason that our houses don’t
look like the ones in Star Wars is not
because we have neither the means nor
reason to build them that way. It’s because
we, as consumers, don’t know how, and if
we don’t knowabout it, we don’t want it.
Anybody who is worried about technolo-
gy taking over our lives needs to take a
look at the high school graduate with the
sub-20,000-word vocabulary. He needs to
think about why the SAT continually

needs recentering. Technology will no
longer advance when we are too stupid to
understand it. There is no reason to build
better computers when we can’t use the
ones wehave. The problem, it seems to

this hardened cynic, is education. Not

only public education, but self—education,
which, let’s face it, is the only option if
anything new is ever to happen.

Clinton, amazingly enough, seems to
realize that the school system in this coun-
try (at least the primary school system) is
slightly less than adequate. The public
school system is a good place to start. But
the fact that ninth graders are learning
C++‘is not really going to help this coun-
try in any really signiﬁcant way. The thing
that is needed ‘ is public education on a
much larger scale. A little understanding
of the world around you can go a long
way toward improving the way you live in
it. Think what a lot would do.

As TommyLee'Jones says in Men in
Black: “Think what you’ll know tomor-
row.” So, now you know about DVD. Go
out and buy a player; they cost about half
again as much as a good VCR. The future,
currently available at your local electron-
ics store. Hey, now you know about the
latest video technology; you’re ahead of
the guys at Blockbuster. And think what
you’ll know tomorrow.

Henry J. Mason wants people to embrace’
technology, not to run away from it.

While the $1,500 tax credit is

tion. If we are truly con-
cerned with allowing more
students the chance to go to
college, we are better off
allocating more funds for
financial aid programs like

Pell" Grants, ’-State‘ Student I

Loans for the following rea-
sons: «

1) Students are in need of
money at: the beginning of
each term when their tuition
bill and rent checks are due.
Title IV financial aid serves

that purpose in a timely man-

ner. This tax credit? reaches
the students on the back end
— in May or June when they
get their tax refund — long
after the money is needed.

2) Students get the
money regardless of need.
Should the taxpayers be
expected to pay for Donald
Trump’s children to go to
school? Most people would
agree that it wouldn’t be con-
sistent with the goal of edu-
cational aid —— assistance for
higher education for those
who need it.

3) The tax credit is only

average.” These stipulations
raise two issues. First, will
we (now start urine tests in
financial aid offices around

the country? Second, this

credit is no longer need-
based when grade restrictions
are placed on it. There are a
lot of good students who do
not maintain a “B” average
their freshman year. In fact,
many of the neediest students
may come from secondary-
school environments that did
not prepare them adequately
forcollege. Are we going to
penalize these "students who
most need our help? Or will
this result in greater pressure
on professors to assign a “B”
or above to students who
haven’t earned it?

offering this tax break for the

Let’s not forget that this plan

as a way to counter the Dole-

Every university or institution of
higher learning has a focus that makes it
unique and different from the next
school. They focus on opportunities for
students within the school — opportuni-
ties that other schools may offer, but may
not pay much attention to.

These opportunities may be aca-
demic in nature '— for example, the den-
tal club or the forensic team. Or, these
niches can be activity based, like the
hockey team or a student—govemment
group. These things add character to a
school and develop its personality.

The University of Pittsburgh is
an academic institution that has many
opportunities to offer to its students.
However, the Board of Trustees and the
academic committees that make the deci-
sions about where the University will
focus its attention have not been the most
thoughtful about allocating resources.
Does our University understand who we
are? Do they understand what this school
really has to offer students that is unique?

We are an urban academic insti-
tution, not a big state school. We have
national swimming and cheerleading
teams, high-ranking academic depart-
ments and a wide variety of top-notch
activities for students. A

Our university could turn its
resources to offer more scholarships for
academics and more awards for achieve-
ment in different programs. This would
be most beneﬁcial to the types of stu-
dents attending Pitt. It would provide a
better outlet for its resources than spend-
ing countless dollars on sporting events
that do not produce the same results.

The University of Pittsburgh is a
diverse group of urban students, staff,
and faculty. That is our strength. That‘ is
what we should focus our attention on,
not sports teams and convocation cen-
ters. The University is its character, not
its image. Thousands of urban students
may not get national television ‘coverage
once or twice a year, but that doesn’t
mean that they’re worth less than some
1osin'g football team. a

The administration should help
us expand student resources and activi-
ties and help us cultivate our interests
besides spectatorship.

We need to look from the inside
to discover our strengths. The University
of Pittsburgh must do the same to dis-
cover the needs of its most important
asset: students.

poor habits are hard to break, but it’s

Had I learned those things in high

hopefully as a professor. But I am still

The tale of the

tape returns

The old saying “You can dress ‘em up
but you can’t take ‘em out” has applied to
the football team formerly known as Pitt for
the past few years. Steve Pederson did
some back—to-school shopping, and the
1997 Panthers will don their rabid—cat garb
when they take on the Prirnanti-esque
Ragin’ Cajuns from Southwestern
Louisiana.

The Tale of the Tape is back to preview
the ‘Sburgh games. (Well, you’re not sup-
posed to call them Pitt anymore, are you?)

' The format is a bit different this year, but

still sane enough to help fans get ready for
Saturdays, and an occasional ridiculous
Thursday, all throughout the fall. VV1thout
further ado, roll the tape.

Coach: Walt Harris vs. Nelson Stokley

Walt Harris has a resumé that many
coaches would die for. He has ﬁne-tuned
several successful NFL quarterbacks and
helped engineer the game-winning drive in
last year’s Rose Bowl win for Ohio State.

Nelson Stokley is in his 12th season at
USL and has compiled a respectable 59-61
-1 mark Last season he led the Cajuns to a
5-6 record. However, his go-to player is his
own son, wide receiver Brandon Stokley.

That really touches a nerve with me.

Besides, Hanis has his players push
trucks up and down the ﬁeld. Enough said.
Advantage: Pitt
Quarterback: Pete Gonzalez vs. Brian
Soignier

Pistol didn’t mess around last spring or
throughout camp this fall, and he beat out
Matt Lytle for the starting job. Last year
Gonzalez started only two games for those
guys named Pitt (just Pitt, back then), and
he completed 30 of 65 attempts for 344
yards and three scores. ,

Soignier doesn’t have a very extensive
track record, but he was a star at Cecilia
High School in Cecilia, La., of Simon and
Garfunkel fame.

The Pistol is one of the best QBs on the
EA Sports College Football ‘98 video
game, and as we all know, that is THE
barometer for all analytical college football
fans.

Advantage: Pitt

Running Back: Dwayne Schulters vs.

Eric Lindsey '
Shifty Schulters spent the summer

' interning in New York and didn’t condition

with the team. That’s good news for the
Cajuns because theywill need all the help
they can get to stop the exciting tailback. He
ﬁnished 1996 with 555 yards on 117 car-
rres.

Lindsey is certainly not the man the
Cajuns planned on being the starter, but an

Ragin’ Cajuns are an "unknown quantity”

Kevin Lilley

Sports Editor

Southwestern Louisiana is a true
unknown.

The Ragin’ Cajuns spent three seasons
in the little-known Big West Conference
before leaving the league in 1996. The
school has played an independent schedule
that rarely reached north of the Mason-
Dixon Line.

'Ihey’ve played one game against a
team in Pennsylvania in their history, losing
to Temple —- 20 years ago. They are 0-1
against the Big East Conference since its
formation in 1991.

Ifthat isn’t enough of a mystery, Ragin’
Cajun Head Coach Nelson Stokley called
his own team an “unknown quantity” earli-

er this week

“I think there are a lot of question marks
right now on this team,” Stokley said

Questions will be answered for both
sides in the ﬁrst-ever meeting between USL
and Pittsburgh at Pitt Stadium this Saturday.

One would hope that Southwestern
Louisiana’s star wide receiver isn’t too
much of a mystery to the coach — Stokley’s
son, Brandon, returns for'his junior season
after amassing 1,160 yards receiving last
year. Stokley and senior wideout Franco

Smith will anchor an inexperienced offense.

that lost its starting quarterback and tailback
from last season.

Junior Brian Soignier will attempt to
replace signal-caller Jack Delhomrne, who
is USL’s all—tirne passing leader. Junior Eric

Lindsey will attempt to replace running
back Kenyon Cotton, who is USL’s all-time
rushing leader. Lindsey is also replacing heir
apparent Darren Brister, who was injured in
spring practice. ,

No wonder the senior Stokley still has
questions about his squad. But while USL
may have some unknowns in the backﬁeld,
the offensive line will surely make an
impression. ’

The Ragin’ Cajuns average 322.2
pounds per player in the trenches —— 52
pounds over Pitt’s defensive ﬁont. Leading
the way at the scale and for most of USL’s
nmning plays are left tackle Anthony
Clement (6-8, 349) and left guard Keith
Ware (6-2, 380).

Kevin Willard leaves Pitt Hoops

The 1997-1998 Pitt basketball team
will be one man down when they begin play
this season. Guard Kevin Willard graduated
inthe springandwillforegohisﬁnalyearof
eligibility at Pitt.

Willard was offered a position with the
Houston Rockets as a ﬁlm coordinator and
with the Boston Celtics as a coaching intern,
as well as several business offers, but he
accepted the entry—level position in Boston.

Pitt basketball Head Coach Ralph
Wﬂlaid acknowledged that the controversy
surrounding the dynamics of the father-son
relationship last year was a motivating fac-
tor in Kevin’s decision to leave. 9

“Kevin wanted to stay and play for a
ﬁfth year,” said the elder Willard. “People

outside of the team focused more on the
father-son relationship‘ rather than Kevin as
a player, which made things difﬁcult. It put
stress on the family and it was basically dif~
ﬁcult. You have to ask yourself, is this real-
ly worth it?”

Wﬂlard continued by emphasizing the
importance of his son accepting the post.

“To have the opportunity to coach is
incredible,” Willard said. “We discussed it
and I asked Kevin, six months from now
could you have gotten a better opportunity?
The answer is no. Kevin worked hard -to
graduate in four years and he couldn’t have
gotten a better opportunity than this.”

For students in the liberal arts, the most prestigious
academic honor is to be elected to Phi Beta Kappa. The
qualiﬁcations for election are more stringent than those for
graduation from the College. Students who aspire to this
honor should plan their curricula during their early
undergraduate years so as to meet the requirements for
membership.

  

For a brochure containing information on these
requirements communicate with Edison Montgomery, the
Secretary of the University Chapter, on 624 - 7323 or by e-
mail to montgome@provost.pitt.edu.

For discussion of the requirements, feel free to make an
appointment to visit with Professor Herbert Chesler,
Chairman of the Elections Committee. His telephone
number is 648 — 1742; his e-mail address is
Chesler+@pitt.edu.

The Pitt Chapter of Phi Beta Kappa encourages
undergraduates to grasp this opportunity to achieve all be
highly important to them throughout their careers.

OFFENSE

tiple plays are possible. \V1thin each play,
multiple options unfold for the quarter-
back. All of this is designed to confuse the
defense with multiple looks.

And give the quarterback, by default,
multiple headaches.

.“Coach Harris has a lot of patience
with me,” said Pete Gonzalez, the redshirt
senior who will be charged with making
the reads and running the offense come
Saturday. “He’l1 dedicate time to the guys
that want to learn.”

Gonzalez beat out junior Matt Lytle
and quarterback-turned—defensive back
Darnell Dinkins for the starting spot.
According to Harris, both Gonzalez and
Lytle will see time in the season’s first
three games in preparation for the tearn’s
Big East schedule. '

“We’re really jelling together as an
offense,” said Gonzalez. “The offensive
line and the running backs are the ones to
watch.”

Dwayne Schulters will lead what
Gonzalez calls a “stable of running
backs” into Saturday’s opener, starting in
the two—back set with fullback Chris
Schneider. Sophomore Hank Poteat is
listed behind Schulters but expects to see
some playing time. Senior Billy West,
redshirt sophomore LeFarm Williams and
true freshman Kevan Barlow could also
rotate in. ‘

When the West Coast scheme enters
its play-action phase, Gonzalez’s main
targets turn from the running backs to the
wide receivers. Senior Jake Hoffart, the

young receiver corps. .

Hoffart got his ﬁrst taste of the West
Coast wide—receiver position in the team’s
first full scrimmage at J ohnstown.
Running the quick slant-ins over the mid-
dle that the offense is known for, the
senior made two behind-the-back catches
and was sandwiched by defensive backs
on more than one occasion.

Despite the punishment, Hoffart is
optimistic about the new scheme.

“It’s tough for the freshmen, but I
think they’re up to it,” said Hoffart, who
is joined by three freshmen, one transfer
and one letterrnan, Vital Joseph, at wide-
out. “I’m a freshman with this offense.”

Cheo Angel will start at the other
receiver post, with transfer Terry Murphy
as his backup. John Jones will draw most
of the medium—range passes at tight end.

Pitt returns big names on the offensive

Julian Graham, Frank Moore, and a

defense that the city is accustomed to.
“I certainly hope to be aggressive,” said

1 , Pitt Defensive Coordinator Lany Coyer, the

architect of this version of the Mad Dog.

Coyer explained that the Panthers’ -1997
installment of the Mad Dog will be as
aggressive as this current group of players
permits. For example, if the defensive backs
are playing well in pass coverage, that will
allow for a more aggressiveness in rushing
the passer. If the comers and safeties are
struggling, more players will drop back into
coverage.

Whatever the speciﬁcs, one thing is
clear — this system is an attacking system

“The main difference in this defense
compared to last year’s is ﬂre stressing of the
pursuit to the ball,” redshirt junior comer-
back Chuck Brown said.

THE PITT NEWS

The scheme is different for the front
seven, too. I

“We really focus on attacking the run,”
senior outside linebacker Ernest Coakley
said.

4 The Panthers realize that a defense with
just a good scheme and a cool name is not
enough to stop any offense; the team must
get the most out of its players to be success-
ful. ~

That’s where Buddy Morris and his
well-publicized, unconventional (to say the
least) conditioning practices come in.
Players and coaches don’t doubt that the Pitt
defenders will be in top shape come
Saturday.

“I’m a lot stronger this year,” Coakley
said. “I was about 205 last year, and I’m
about 220 now. That’s because of ‘The
Buddy System.”’

The coaches are aware of the extra edge

Monis’ regimen brings to the players.
“Buddy Monis is as good [a condition-
ing coach] as I’ve ever seen,” said Coyer,
who has been coaching football since 1965.
The players’ increased strength and
endurance at practices (including a long
stretch of three—a-days at camp) have made
the beneﬁts of Monis’s conditioning evident.
Another valuable beneﬁt of the players’
conditioning has been the reduction of play-
ers on the shelf, although there have been
two serious injuries to would-be starters.
Knee injuries to linebacker Rod Humphrey
and safety John Jenkins, both seniors, will
keep the players out for a while, with a
chance that Humphrey will miss the entire
season.
Hurnphrey’s veteran leadership will be
missed; he was. expected to anchor the

1 defense as the team’s middle linebacker.

Other upperclassmen will have to step up

Coakley is one such player. He had an
impressive training camp and drew the
praise of the coaching staif. He will man the
right outside linebacker spot in the Mad Dog.

Junior Phil Clarke will replace
Humphrey in the middle, and converted cor-
nerback E.C. Varoutsos ﬁgures to start at left
outside linebacker.

man Jeff McCurley will start at tackle, with
redshirt ffeshrnan Calvin Robinson and red-
shirt sophomore Julian Graham getting -the
starting nod at defensive end — the primary
pass-rushing spot in the Mad Dog.

Sophomore Demond Gibson lost his
starting job in camp, but expect to see him
get plenty of playing time and possibly

Jenkins was expected to be the leader of

On defense, though, six of the team’s
starting from seven graduated at the end of
last season. Only linebacker Chucky
Woodall returns, and he lost his starting job.

Mook starts the college season with a few pushover plays

Welcome to another season of col-
lege football. The season is starting fairly
slow this year, with relatively few inter-
esting games on tap this weekend. What
you have this weekend are games, like
Akron at Nebraska, that are meant to pad
the records of powerhouse teams. So I’ll
do a little record-padding myself.

Southwest Louisiana (+ 7) at Pitt
You’ll deﬁnitely want to head out to
the fireworks at Pitt Stadium this
Saturday afternoon. We know that Pitt
had  well, let’s just say the Panthers had
some problems on defense last year,

- allowing over 39 points per game. But’

Southwest Louisiana was almost as bad,
giving up nearly 37. Also, with the excep—

 

tion of Boston College, every other team
on the Panthers’ schedule this season has
the potential to be in the nation’s top 25 or
the bottom 25. This means that if you
want to see a good, competitive Panther
football game this season, this one is your
best bet.

This brings us to the point spread.
The Panthers are listed as seven—point
favorites. I can see the case for either team

being favored here, but if VV1zards of
Odds think either team will cover a seven-
point spread in this game, I shudder to
think of the spread next week when Pitt
travels to State College. So, as much as it
pains me to pick a team called the “Ragin’
Cajuns,” I gotta do what I gotta do.

Pitt 42, Southwest Louisiana 41

Marshall (+16) at West Virginia

I can’tf1gure out why so many people
are excited about this game. It’s being
billed as the battle for bragging rights in
West Virginia (now there’s something to
be coveted), but this is a pointless game.
We have a team in Marshall that is fresh
up from Division H playing against not
just any Division I team, but the Division

IS IN crass.  

Excitement and adventure
is the course description,
and Army ROTC is the
name. It's the one college
elective that builds
your self-conﬁdence,
develops your leader-

ship potential and helps

lenge of command.
There's no obligation
until your junior year,
so there's no reason not
to try it out right now.

,

I team that had the nation’s best defense
last year. Plus, WVU has pretty much its
whole defensive line (which was one of
its strong points) returning.

West Virginia 38, Marshall 3

Houston (+16 1/2) at Alabama
Alabama is ranked No. 16 in the
nation, and that’s probably a fair spot for

them. It’s not the Crimson Tide I’m wor— ~

ried about in this game, it’s Houston. Is
this the Cougar team that won Conference
USA and went to the Liberty Bowl last
year, or the team that went a combined 4-
28-1 in the three preceding seasons?
Houston is another team with most of its
defense returning, but it won with its
offense last season, and the four quarter-
backs on the roster have thrown a grand
total of one pass in college.

Alabama 34, Houston 6

Sure Thing of the Week:
Wyoming (+30) at Ohio State

This is the most ridiculously large
point spread I’ve seen in a while. Yes,
Wyoming lost the nation’s leading receiv-
er in Marcus Harris and has only nine
returning starters. But this is still a team
that went 10-2 last year and, in one of the
greatest shafts since Mr. Ed was taken off
the air, still didn’t go to a bowl game. And
you don’t think Wyoming will be honked
off enough to come within at least four
touchdowns, even against OSU?
