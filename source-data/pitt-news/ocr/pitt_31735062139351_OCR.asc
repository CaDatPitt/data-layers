In co'ntests that were full Of
spirited work the Sophs of the Uni-

year men, at the new Trees Stadium,

Wednesdayafternoon. At the close

A‘ V°of the contests all he participantshrin

the various . events of the, afternoon

iwere awar_e of the fact that they had

been through one ‘ of the ﬁercest

afternoons of work they had ever
tackled. —. .

The sand bag contest was the real

it '.ﬁght of the day, and was accorded

the last place in the events of the

afternoon. About one ‘hundred Sophs

‘were given several bags of sand .to

‘ protect -while the Fresh were .sup—

posed to rush the second year men

, and take possession of the sand bags.

._ At a given‘ signal the Fresh made a

 I - rush for the Sophs and the sand bags

ii and for ﬁve minutes the air was a

mixture of dirt, sand, Fresh, flying ,

classmen, and a very -choice selection
' "of college yells, and a iew that were
‘not exact1y’college yells but served
the purpose. At. the end of the time
limit the Sophs were declared the
winners of the event, much ,.to the
" , dismay of the poor Fresh.’
. The Sophs were also the victors in
the tieing contest. In this clash the
classes lined up at opposite ends of
the ﬁeld, in twos. Of each pair the
larger man wasto do all the heavy
_.4work. _The smaller man was sup-
plied with a short rope. The sides
were to advance andgo at each other
.and see‘who could tie up the mgst
_opponents in the given time. The
_ Sophs were the winners by the score
of 45 to 22.

Accqmpanies the Party On Train as

Chancellor McCormick accom— ‘

the “Made ‘in Pittsburgh

» Pad-uciah, St.
»‘ Louisville, Dayton,_Cin—cinnati and Co-

- and larger impression of

-i.l0th,'and returned ‘on the night of.

September 28th., The train piassed
through eighteenstates and stopped
at thirty-six cities. The Chancellor

left the train at Nashville, in order to

i, _ get home a few days before the open-
A ing of the University, .but was with

the company in all of the cities except
Louis, Indianapolis,

flumbus} ~  _
. Wh'en asked about the trip the
‘Chancellor «said:
_’ “In the ﬁrst place, those who com-
posed this company received a new
i I the —real
greatness of our country. In every
State are large and growing ‘cities,
full of life and vigor, ambitious for
’ growth, for commercial development,

‘A and for larger opportunity on the part

of their‘ citizens. The commercial

’ bodies in these cities -were without ex-

ception found to be alive to the needs
ofitheir constituents, and anxious to
extend trade relations with every part
‘of their several States. Someiof these
-cities have become extremely beauti-

V Aful, with streets equal to those of any-

city in the country, with parks,

Aboulevards, and splendid buildings for;
A public and private use. Any one who

‘has any disposition to be skepti-cal as
to the “future of the country needs

. 5 only to travel in order to have his

doubts forever removed.
'“In thenext place, the whole coun-

I iry is -marvelously prosperous. The.
 basis of material prosperity is largely

the -products ofthe soil. This year

. the crops~are vast in their extent. Int

other years‘ there have been large

I crops of thisior that, but the year
M1912 is a banner year throughout the

Corn,

. country, for allfarmproducts.
wheat, oats, barley, fruits

' I ‘kind and description, have swelled the

sum total of the wealth of the’nation
to something almost impossible of re-

_ alization. This fact ‘has ﬁlled the peo-

ple with energy, enthusiasm, expec-

' tation‘, -hope-, so that there is no pos-

sibility of a single pessimistic notie.

_V ’ By reason of it, new industries are be-
f‘1ng. undertaken; plans are made for

<enla'i-gernent in every direction; and"
there is but a single thought, and.that
is that the nation is entering upon a

1 _-’_perio'd ofiunexampled prosperity.‘

“Another obvious condition’ is that

_ ‘.of_broad outlook upon the nation as
_ ‘ a whole. The people of‘ the West are
it l_T_-‘corning to realize the’ oneness. of the
‘,.nation. Problems which have been
’ ‘:8eemed local arebecoming recognized -
 national in scope. The people are

is without its value to the people as A

a whole. It isieasier now to think in
terms. of the nation than it has ever
been before. The problerﬁ is for the
people all over the country to get ac-
quainted with each other. Pittsburgh
is better known throughout the entire
Middle \/Vest and South by reason of
this excursion than it has ever been
before. Pittsburgh knows this vast
country better than" it has ever known
it before. We found that the people
are just the same as ourselves: inter-

ested in the same things which inter-

est .us—-schoolsfcolleges, universities.
parks, good homes, public improve-
ments, things that make not alone for
the material, but also for the moral,
and "intellectual, .and'spiritual welfare
of the comrminities.

“The members -of ‘-the party came

home with a spirit of enthusiam al-,

most impossible of comprehension.
They believe in the people more com-
-pletely than ever before. Pittsburgh,
the manufacturing center of the
world, was preached to nearly two
score of cities; but Pittsburgh, the
‘home of the University, of the Tech-
nical Schools, of the Institute; Pitts-
burgh,‘ with its parks, its Memorial
building, its high ideals of citizenshin,
was also preached throughout the en-
tire jou-r_ney.. It was a great excur-
sion, a wonderful journey, a triumph-
ant progress.” '

The .Chancellor believes that if
every member of i the excursion re-
ceived as much from it as he himself
did, that the result must be great good
to P=ittsb_urgh, no-t alone in the exten-
sioﬂ -of trade, but also in the develop-
ment of other ,-things equally worth
while."

UNIVERSITY“ RESTAURANT
I ’ MAKES ITS DEBUT
First Class Lunch Room.‘ ion the
Campus—Great ‘Thing for the H
Students—Gocd Trade‘
Anticipated. ,

One of the many improvements
that have been made aiound the Uni-
versity since school closed last June
is the opening of a.ﬁrsi:—class restau-
rant and dairy lunch on the campus.
The restaurant is called the Universi-
tyi Restaurant and is first class in
every detail. Located where the
School of Education formerly held
forth, the new lunch room is central-

ly located and‘ within two minutes"

walk of anylof the buildings.

It ‘has been the desireiof the Uni-
versﬂitylauthorities to have sucha res-
taurant for a long time, where the
students that desire to pufchase their

lunch may get a good, . substantial‘

meal at a reasonableiprice without.
having to travel’ any greataehdistance

from» the campus, and many of the

authoritiesrhave expressed the opinion

that the new~restaurant will ‘be a suc-
cess from the_ start.  . A ~

H. L. Wolfe, manngeriof the res-
taurant, expressed. himself“ as pleased
withithe Outlook at the present time.
He said: “I feel sure that ‘the stu-

.dents will ﬁnd that we are willingand

able to give_therrl as good. service as
they would be able to get atanyiother

lunch room, and we willmake every .

effort to meet the demandsgpf the stu-
dents. Dinners are served for thirty-
five cents, but the. studenttfﬂcan buy
as little or as much they desire by go-
ing to the‘counter, the same as they
would do at a dairy lunch. if

“I wouldsuggest to the boys that
those that do not wish to buy a ‘dinner
would save time by simply coming to
the -counter and purchasing all that
they desire and then going to a table
to eat, insteadofggiving a lunch order

to the waitress, as they are supposed .
orders, while‘

to serve the dinner
other orders are to; be conducted on
the dairy lunchlplan. Ladies can be
served. either way.” A ‘
Breakfast is served at the, new res-
taurant from 7 until 9; dinner from ‘-1

until 2; supper from 5,_to 7;, but‘ light 

lunches of all sorts vvilligbe 0n,sale at

Pitt will play the second game of if

her 1912 schedule to-Vmorrow at
Forbes Field and, while all the Gold

t .

and Blue adherentsexpect a victory, J ‘=

all concede that the game will be a

hard one. The New Wilmington del— .

egation has always given the .VarsitY
a hard tussel and from recent reports
this year will be no exception.

Coach Joe Thompson noticedmany

glaring defects in the O. N. U. game '

last Saturday‘and has spent‘ a busv
week strengthening the weak spots
and improving the tackling and of-
fense. The practice _of thevpast week «
has.ibeen in H the? rudiments of the

game. The ,_batt1e—scarred tackling

dummy has received many bruising, 

falls under the hurtling bodies of the _

gridiron aspirants and ,i the smooth
turf of Trees Stadium shows the effect
of the cleats of charging linemen and
plunging backs. '
Tlie lineup at present is in doubt,

but a good bet is as follows: iCenter,: '

H.o~ck,ensmith’; guards, Smith ‘and

U

Leahy; tackles, Blair and liratt; ends, « ii

Egbert and Wagner} quarter, VVarrl,;,

McE1lroy or Connelly; backs, Dillon‘,-

Galvin will not play as a bad cpld has

fair to _make_ good in his place. Hetiis
a heavy-built lad and has played ;
star game at Kiski for the past sev-
eral years. If he develops to such an
extent as many predict, Captain “Gal-

vin may be used ’as fullback, as this '

_ Aninteresting ﬁght for‘ quarterback

and McEllroy of the ’11 squad, and

Ward, a new comer. All are showing,

up well 'a11d their chances for a regu-

and McEllroy seem particularly adept
at goal kicking. ‘ ii ‘
Wagner is the same star of old aild
retains his position‘undisputed. Eg-
bert, Blumenthal, Kipp, Muilphy, C0'I~
has and several others are out for this
job and all look good. ,
Pratt and John Blair, a new comer
from Indiana Normal, have the call at
tackle so far,, but th.e former will
probably be ousted as he seems to
ladk the very necessary article known
as “pep.” Dunn, Shapira, Gehlert,
Hoag, 'Hen_iphill and several others

i are out to beat the guards and tackles

and any game may see them in the

_lineup.

Smith and Lea'hy, both seasoned
players, are again at guards and look

‘like’ ﬁxtures. Captain “Po1ly” Galvin
is at eenter, but as su-ggested previous-

ly, -he may be shifted to full with

Hockensmiiﬂi at the center position.
The loss of such men as Dewar,

Ambitious sophomores spent the
greater/part of,Monday night placing
posters in all the prominent places
about the University and Oakland,
and when the ﬁrst arrivals came to
school on -Tuesday morning they
found all the walks around the’Uni—
versity buildings, the streets, and the
University buildings themselves be-
decked with gorgeous yellow posters.
On the bills were printed many of
threats to the lowly fresh, if they
failed to give all due respect to the
sopho.mores and the upper classmers.
The headline of the posters read:
SMALLPOX, and at ﬁrst glance one
might have thought that the Univer--
sity was "under quarantine. A close:

SOPII-IS GET i=osTEi;s

 

_lool< revealed theifactf that the Fresh

were a grtater pest to humanity than:
the dreaded d-ise.ase. . No posters ap-

The new Dental building on the

n ' ‘. )‘ .

The ﬁrst production tobe madebji

t‘he ‘reunited and perenially popular ”

theatrical ﬁrm of Weber & Fields
comes. to the Alvin Theater for the
week beginning Monday, October 7.

It is called ‘,‘The June Bride” and is.,

a Viennese Zoperatta in threeacts

adapted from the German by Edgar '

Smith, with music by Edmund Eysler.
The piece is booked for an early -pre-
sentation in New York, where it is
expected that it will duplicate its great
success of three years .ago in Vienna
and on the continent.

The score is said to fairly effervesce
with melody. Each of the- songs
grows naturally out of the story and
the composer has so individualized his
numbers that they interpret the spirit
andcharrn of the book, which spar-
kles with real comedy. The entire
production, it is promised, will be per-

meated_ with daintiness; delicacy and-

cliarm. . A

Heading the l.arge cast will be Miss
Amelia Stone, recognized as one of
the most charming prima don-nas on
the American stage. Miss Stone is
said to have a role admirably ﬁtted
to_her arch and piiquant personality.
Others .in the cast include Flavija.
Arcaro, a gifted contralto and,char-
acter comedienne; Hazel Kirke, Ar-

thur Lipsen, David*Torrence, Ernest ,

Truax, Helen Hayes, Donald Mac-
Kenzie and Henry A. Barrows. A
Incidental features‘, of unusual" in-
terest will be. the presentation of 1
Gypsy ballet by Mlle.‘ LaGaie and M;
Piate, assisted by sixteen specially
trained dancers and the presence of
an augmented orchestra of twenty-
four pieces. ‘
