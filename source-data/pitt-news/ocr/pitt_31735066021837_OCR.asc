Liver transplantcandidate arrives at Pittfor testing  

By Beth Froelich

Staff Writer

Seven-year—old Ronald ”Ron—
nie” DeSillers arrived at Chil-
drens Hospital in Pittsburgh
yesterday atw4:30 p.m. He will
undergo testing that will deter-
mine if he will be placed on the
national organ doner waiting list.

Recently, Ronnie received me-
dia attention when $4,000 raised
for his liver transplant was stolen.
The money was'co|lected by his
classmates at St. Anthony's
Catholic School in Miami, Fla.

Following the theft, contribu-
tions poured in from the public
and most notably a $1,000 con-

’ tribution and letter from President

Reagan.

‘Since that time an estimated
$400,000 has been raised to aid
the DeSi|lers family in paying for
Ronnie's care.

Ronnie was born with a liver

that is unable to expel fluids. This '

has resulted in cirrhosis and liver
failure.

Ronnie will be in Pittsburgh for
four to five days while he under-
goes evalution by the staff of Chil-
drens Hospital to determine if he

is eligible to receive a liver

transplant. . ~ A
The extensive testing will con-

sist of X-rays, blood tests and tests‘

on the current state of his liver.

The DeSillers family will also un-

dergo psycho—socia| testing to de-
termine how the social workers
at Childrens Hospital could assist
them in this time of stress.

Sue Cardillio from the Chil-—

His need for an organ
 is really up to our
surgeons to determine.

— Sue Cardillio

drens Hospital Public Relations
Department speculated that Ron-
nie's condition is serious enough
to warrant a liver transplant.

”From the information we
gather-from the media, we as-
sume that his need for an organ
is significant, but that is really up
to ourisurgeons to determine,”
said Cardillio.

If Ronnie were placed on the
organ transplant |_ist, he would be
required to pay $162,000 prior to
a transplant operation. The total-
cost of such an operation can cost
$250,000 or more depending on
the rate of recovery. .

According to Mrs. DeSillers,
Ronnie's insurance was can-
celled four and a halfyears ago.

”If it's a pre-existing condition
they won't insure you,” said, Mrs.
DeSi|lers. ”I became an insur-
ance agent forlone and a- half
years to try and get him insured,
but that didn't work, so I got out
of that business.”

Childrens Hospital is merely
the first step in the DeSillers’ fight
for their son's life. Ronnie's step-
father said that the signs at their

Giant Eagle robbed

By Kathy Stahl

News Editor

_ The Giant Eagle on Center
Avenue in Oakland was robbed
at approximately 10 p.m. Mon-
day. An amount of $1,400 in
cash was taken.

The robbery was carried out by
two armed men wearing I ski

masks who entered through the .

front door. One carried a knife,
and the other carried a gun.

_ The first robber, who carried
the knife, told employee's Cyn-
thia Johnson and William Butler
to lay on the floor. He then ap-
proached employee Beth Coro-

—da, telling her to open‘ her

register, which was located

closest to the front entrance of the

store. Coroda told him she
couldn't open the register.

‘ _ ’.’It was about closing time,”

said Coroda,-.g”a’nd' I- was ringing

. couldn't even think. We have

certain numbers that we punch in
to open‘the register but I couldn't
open the drawer. Then he pulled

.my hair and threw me on the

ground.” I

The robber proceeded to rip
open the register and remove
$400. ”With one pull, he broke
the register in two pieces,” said
Coroda.

-While this was going on, the
other robber moved toward the
front store register. He leaned
over the cage of the office, point-
ing his revolver at employee An-
thony Barbano, floor manager

William Bricker.

According to police reports, the
robber told them, ”I want all your
money. Open up, or I'll blow

The applicants for director of
student activities have begun

visits for interviews are creating
a stir in the William Pitt Union.

Conney Kimbo, vice president
for student affairs, said yesterday
five candidates have been sched-
uled for interviews, and he may
schedule one or twomore.

Thehi ring process includes in-
_ terviews with a group of student
leaders and meetings with assis-

Though none chose to com-
ment for publication, several as-
sistant directors in the office
expressed displeasure with the in-
terview process.

According to Kimbo, the assis-
tant directors are required to meet
with the applicants and respond
to questions from them about
their departments. They are not to

Kremlin orders release of two moredissidents

 

MOSCOW — The Soviet
government announced Tuesday
that two more dissidents have
been ordered released from pri-
son and that Jewish activist Josef

If they are released, it would be
in line with Kremlin actions to

' free dissidents whose imprison-

ment has been an obstacle to bet-

Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gor-
bachev has launched a liberaliza-
tion drive and has said the Soviet
Union is changing its approach to
human rights ”for all to see.”
Foreign Ministry spokesman
Gennady Gerasimov said the
government has ordered the
release of Anatoly Koryagin and
Alexander Ogorodnikov and will

DELMONT, Pa. — The Roman

The Rev. Roger Trott, 42, form-

Agency officials fail to

WASHINGTON —— Acting CIA
Director Robert M. Gates, facing
sharp questioning today about
the Iran-Contra affair in Senate
confirmation hearings, testified
last April that CIA employees be-

sight process.

He said nearly two-thirds of the

agency's employees had been_

hired since Congress tightened
controls on U.S. intelligence a de-
cade ago and ”they know no

sional oversight.” _

But Gates and other top agen-
cy officials failed to tell Congress
of the CIA role in the secret arms
deal with Tehran or their suspi-
cions that some of the proceeds
went to help Nicaragua’s Contra
rebels.

Senators on the Select Intelli-
gence Committee said they
would ask Gates today to explain
the CIA role in the lran-Contra af-
fair and to renew his pledge to
cooperate with congressional
oversight panels.

Gates, a 43-year-old career CIA
analyst, was nominated this
month to replace .William J.

tends to make two points clear
during his visit here: Arming Iran
was a U.S. idea, and Israel had
nothing to do with the secret fund
for Nicaraguan rebels.

Shamir, according to Israeli
officials, will stress his nation's
close ties with the United States
and a willingness to‘ explore
peace prospects with its Arab
neighbors during a threeday visit
beginning today.

He is expecting a warm recep-
tion from President Reagan and
senior adminsitration officials,
with only a new U.S. arms plan
for Jordan and Saudi Arabia a
potential source of friction.

But the visit is still likely to be
marked by controversy as Shamir
faces members/of Congress and
an American press eager to get at

Also, the prime minister is

’Streaker’ one step
ahead of local police

MOUNT PLEASANT, Pa. — A
fast-moving exhibitionist has
stayed at least one step ahead of
police since beginning a series of
appearances two years ago in this
southwestern Pennsylvania com-
munity.

”The closest we've ever come
is arriving on the scene five
minutes after we get the call, and
you know how far a person can
go in five minutes,” said Mount
Pleasant police officer Richard
McElfresh. ”It’s been a long-
running thing, and people tend to
get a little frustrated.”

The man, known to police only
as ”the streaker,” last month ran
through the to/wn wearing only a
ski mask and ‘shoes. Two days
later, he appeared wearing a pink
scuba outfit that left his lower
body exposed.

By Laura McPherson

For The Pitt News

The $2 million renovation of

-Hillman Library begun several

months ago is expected to be
completed by the beginning of
April. .

Aside from the obvious change
in the physical layout of the facil-
ity, the library will unveil a'new
card catalogue system starting in

I May.

”PITTCAT,” a computerized
card catalogue system, is being
installed in the university libraries
as part of the Campus of the Fu—
ture project. _

”The biggest benefit of the au-
tomation will be that anybody
with access to a microcomputer
anywhere on campus can call in
and use the card catalogue,” ac-

cording to Pam Vance, assistant
director of Access and Adminis-
trative Services for the university
libraries.

Students will be‘ able to check

the status of a book by consult-
ing the computer. The system will
keep a record of books ordered
and the anticipated date of ar-
rival. They can also retrieve infor-
mation about books in all
libraries, including those in Pitt's
regional campuses.
. The major advantage of the sys-
tem will be the reduction of the
time it ordinarily takes _to retrieve
information.

Many of the new terminals are
located on the ground floor of
Hillman Library next to the cur-
rent card catalogue. Desk atten-
dants will staff the terminals in
the event that a user has a

problem with the system.

—Full service has been temporar-
ily reduced due to the renova-
tions. This applies mainly to
Hillman Library. Services offered
at Hillman have been relocated
or temporarily discontinued to
accomodate the renovation and
automation.

Some students say they have
not been affected by the new
construction.

’’It doesn't really bother me. I
don't really know what they're
doing, but it isn't bothering me at
said freshman David
Jaminski.

However, a student worker at
Hillman expressed a different
view.

”|t’s a hassle. All of the refer-
ence books are everywhere, and
there are no tables by sections of

the card catalogue. It - really
makes my job tough. I don't
know ifthis is all worth it or not.”

According to Vance, ”lt's
definitely worth it. The automa-
tion of the card catalogue system
will enable Hillman to give much
better service to the faculty, stu-
dents and staff of the university.
The renovation will create a bet-
ter atmosphere to study and work
in. I can see where it is frustrat-
ing now, but it will definitely be
worth it.”

A potential problem with the
computerization of the card cata-
logue system is the possibilty of
the system crashing. According to
Vance, if the system crashes, the
card catalogue will not be oper-
ational. However, there will be a
back-up system so books can still
be checked out. _ "

A sign stating that only three
students are permitted in the
Sheetz convenience store on
Forbes Avenue at’ any time
pertains only to secondary
school students, according to
the store's manager.

’’It’s the kids that come in af-
ter school, most of them are
age 13 to 16,” said the
manager, who requested her

name not be printed because
of Sheetz policy. “They come

. in five at a time and, usually,

only one of them will buy
something."

She said that often the -re-
maining students will shoplift
small items while one is actu-
ally making a purchase.

”In the past couple of
weeks, it has gotten worse,”
she said. ”We put the sign up
so we could politely ask them 6
to leave.”

Sheetz cracksdown on shoplifters

She said the sign has been
effective. Her biggest problem
is that there is little the store
can do when juveniles are
caught shoplifting.

”If we catch them, usually
we'll just ask for the product
to be returned,” she said.
”Nine times out of 10, they'll.
give it back.

”I’ve chased a few of them,
but there are so many places
to run to and, by the time the
police get here, the kid is long

gone.” . __
Although she is trying to
curb the shoplifting, she said
the store doesn't lose enough‘
to have a big effect on profits.
”I thought the shoplifting
problem would be a lot worse
than it is here,” she said.
”Most of what they steal is ‘just

you mad when it happens.”

 Fratern iti es s h ow  
better judgment

The fraternities at Pitt have expressed concern recently about
the crackdown on the Penn State fraternities’ drinking problems.

1 1 There is‘ no indication that the same th'ingVwill_ happen in Oak-

‘land —— for a very good reason.
' When dry rush was implemented, there was an outcry, but
the houses complied. As a result, there was much less drink-
ing, and the Pitt fraternities earned a reputation for'responsi-
bility concerning alcohol. And a welcome change it is.

_No longer are there stories floating down the hill about
drunken’ revels, and the whole image of the fraternities has been
enhanced as a result.

_ ; At Penn State, things are different. They continue to have the

reputation as a place to get good ’n’ drunk. Truly a fine state«
of affairs for a university. With dry rush, lwehave gained a new
respectability, one that was much needed.

Additionally, with dry rush, also comes safer conditions from

a legal point of view. A fraternity — as well as the university

— can be held financially responsible in a court of law for the
injuries suffered by a student who got drunk at a fraternity party.
We have learned this from Penn State. Preventive medicine —
such as dry rush — keeps all the parties involved out of com-
promising positions. '
If our fraternities continue to have the attitude they have
shown this year toward the use of alcohol, we will never have
to worry about the same sort of thing at Pitt. We will be able
to go on with fraternity life without intervention from the LCB.
The drinking age is a law —— not just a good idea —— and it

is refreshing to see it treated as such on the campus.

False premises can lead to

Your Feb. 13 issue carried Janet
Schweibinz’s ‘ letter ”Mistakes
and the bomb?” Her reply to
Cr_ary’s ”Mysticism and the
bomb” starts outfrom the follow-

‘ ., ing claim, which is demonstrably

incorrect: ”As we certainly must
know, if the premises are false,
any conclusion, regardless of the
soundness of the logical reason-
ing,'is also false.” .

On the contrary, it is a fact of

' elementary logic that true conclu-

sions can be validly deduced
from false premises, as in: Pitt is
an insane asylum, and all insane
asylums are located in Pittsburgh;
therefore, Pitt is located in Pitts-
burgh. Indeed, as the history of

science shows, false theories

often yield observationally true
predictions by valid deduction.

‘Light the Cathedral

/

As an avid Pitt fan, I have been

among those thousands cheering ,

both the football and basketball
teams. A tradition was started a
few years ago with the lighting of
the top of the Cathedral of Learn-.
ing when the football team wins.
This tradition serves as both a
reminder and an advertiser of
Pitt's ‘victory. The question is,
why isn't the Cathedral lit up
when the basketball team wins?
It is obvious that Pitt's Top 10
basketball team is important to
the university, and the universi-
ty’s committment to building a Fi-
nal 4 contender is clear,
especially with the acquisition of

Coach Evans. What has hap-_

pened to the spirit of winning?
The administration of Pitt
should jump on the bandwagon
with the rest of the university. For
the amount of money that was
spent on installing the lights, as
opposed to the football team, the
basketball team will win more
than five or six games a year, and
now the lights will not need to be
dusted off (from lack of use) after
football season. The basketball

team is as important asthe foot-

It is not the scourge of God.'That
last concept, the ”scourge of

most Americans a convenient
reason to write off any responsi-
bility for coping and provides a
windfall to the Fundamentalist

course, you have a-lot of money,
which can buy you a plot in
heaven anywhere.

But assume, momentarily, that
within well defined limits of toler-
ance, you are kind enough to
voluntarily work for the improve-
ment of general conditions for the
weak, the sick or the needy. Then
assume a little faith, because that
is where the pain turns to re-
joicing.

With faith, one can see beauty
even in dying. The compassion of
peers, for we all die, the gentle-
ness which prevails over cruelty, '
these are moments of acceptance

which can transform the ex-
perience of the stricken, be they

in pain, deranged or suffering

from humiliation, into a noble ex-
perience,’ an experience of irony.

There will be nothing fun about
the health care catastrophe await-
ing up to 1.5 million Americans.

It will be a great trial for our so-_

ciety, for we are a" paranoid soci-
ety with strong militant
undercurrents. But the will to
transform the experience from a
paranoidal and reactionary fear-
mongering, to a passionate work
for compassion and sanity will
come from within the hearts and
minds of those who are willing to
be practical and who work for the
reduction of pain, trauma and hu-
miliation in this health care catas-
trophe.

The weapons in the fight
against AIDS are kindness and
humility versus cruelty and fear,
and this is true of many struggles
in this strange game, the golden
age of man.

true conclusions

has been set at 21 for some time,
and it's completely hypocritical.
The law says that you, if you are

under 21, aren't capable of drink-

ing in a mature manner. But if
you are arrested for breaking this
law, you won't exactly end up-in
juvenile court. The hypocricy
doesn't stop here.

There are a lot of activities you
can take part in. You can vote for
the most powerful person in the
world. While on the way to the

voting booth, you should stop at

the post office to register for the
draft; it's required. Do you want
to see an X-rated movie on the
way back? You're allowed. Or in-
stead, go buy a lottery ticket. Af-
ter all, you're over 18. But don't
plan on stopping at Zelda's. Ac-
cording to the state, you're not
”adult" enough for this.

As senseless as this law is, it's
really the fault of all of you un-
der 21. By not letting our
representatives - know how you
feel, i.e. not voting, you allowed
yourselves to be denied an adult

privilege. But'it’s not too late._

Rhinestones are

Inferiority complexinhibits Pitt      
  good for beepers  

Oakland is no place for melodi-
ous phrases.”

Last term, I took Professor
Richard Cottam’s class ”Political

‘)i
\“

Strategy in International Rela-
tions.” If you think the course
sounds tough, that's probably be-
cause it is. The entire second half
features a kind of war game —
played on the battlefields of
1991. Success in the game re-
quires intelligence, creativity and
often inexhaustible determi-
nation.

One of Cottam’s teaching assis-
tants told me that when he was
at Yale, a similar game was
played and then dropped; the stu-

dents there just couldn't hack it. -

He went on to say that he thought
Pitt- had some of the brightest,
most creative students around. In
fact, in his view, Pitt might quali-
fy as one of the nation's finest
schools if it weren't for just one
thing.

_"This university," he said, "has
got such a damn inferiority
complex."

Indeed. Let's face it. Very rare-
ly does one hear students say

anything good about Pitt. Most

people seem ashamed to be here.
How many times have you
heard, "Stanford and CMU

turned me down, so I ended up

here.”

This mentality seems almost as
prevalent among faculty. One
gets the impression that many

JACK
BIIRKMAN

profs conceive of Pitt as a kind of
vocational institution, thats
primary purpose is to arm stu-
dents with the skills needed in the
working world.

To be sure, such an approach

is not without merit, especially in -

the 1980s. However, if carried to
extremes, utilitarianism can deci-
mate any curriculum's academic
integrity.

Nowhere is this more evident

than in writing courses. Students

who wish to write in a scholarly
fashion are constantly dis-
couraged. The student who likes
to try his hand at figurative lan-
guage, the student who views
writing-as an art and not a science
has no place at Pitt.

Time after time, in many
departments and with a variety of
students, I've read comments
criticizing style. Paraphrased,
most seemed to be saying the
same thing: "Look, the way you
write is fine. But we at Pitt don't
like high-fa|utin' rhythmically
balanced sentences. If you want-
ed to write like this, you should
have gone to Harvard or Yale.

Admittedly, this is exaggerated,
but anyone who's ever been criti-
cized for creative expression gets
the point: What underlies the
utilitarian mentality that so
strongly influences writing and so
many other realms of academia
is rooted in a deep-seated feeling
of inferiority.

But, contrary to popular belief,
we at Pitt have precious little to
feel inferior about. Let's take a
look at who we are:

Our philosophy department is
No. 1 in the country. Our Law
School is in the top 20. Our
School of Engineering is in the
top five. Our International Studies
Program ranks with the best. We
have a host of professors who are
nationally renowned in their
fields. =

Take Richard Cottam, for in-

. stance, the man I menti_oned

earlier. _
Cottam is one of the top two

' Mid-Eastern experts in the Unit-

ed States.

As it enters its third century, the
University of Pittsburgh has enor-
mous potential. One has to be-

lieve, however, that Pitt will

never beﬂall it can be unless it gets
rid of its inferiority complex once
and for all.

Child owes hislife to a thief

Ronnie DeSillers is lucky that
the money for his liver transplant
operation was stolen. - .

I don't mean that he's a lucky ' I
-kid in general. Ronnie DeSillers

was born with a liver that is una-
ble to expel fluids. His condition
led to cirrhosis, and unless he
receives a" transplant within six
months, he will probably die.

His schoolmates at St. Antho-
ny’s Catholic School raised.
$4,000 to help pay for his opera-
tion, but the money was stolen.
At that point $89,000 had been
raised for the boy.

Since the money was stolen,
$400,000 has poured in from all
over the country. A billionaire
from Miami Beach donated
$200,000. Even President Reagan
donated $1,000.

Incidentally, Vice President
Bush didn't send Ronnie any
money, but he did send a note
and a photo of himself. What a
generous guy.

Think about it. $4,000 was sto-
len, but after it was stolen,
$400,000 came rolling in. Little
Ronnie couldn't have done bet-
ter if it had been planned that
way.

I'm glad.-_th,'at all this. money was
raised for'a sick little boy. Think
about the thousands of other sick
children who weren't lucky
enough to have the money raised
for their operationsstolen -— who
weren't lucky enough to have the
money raised, period.

When people hear about a sick
little kid who needs money for an
operation, they naturally feel a lit-
tle tug on their heartstrings, and
they all want to do their part to
help. It's a good reflection on
people in general. Little Ronnie
is lucky that people heard about
him. It's unlikely that anyone
would have heard about him if
some slime hadn't stolen that

 

TERESA
- CANDORI

$4,000.

.Now that everyone knows
about Ronnie, I'm willing to bet
there will be a huge public out-
cry if Ronnie doesn't get a liver.

There are about 90 children on
the waiting list at Chilren’s Hospi-
tal alone. Children’s Hospital nor-

' mally performs about 65 liver

transplants a year. If Ronnie were
to be added to the bottom of that
list, he wouldn't live to move
three-fourths of the way to the
top.

But maybe some of the chil-
dren on the list aren't as desper-
ate as Ronnie. Maybe some of
themhave a year. So maybe Ron-
nie will be placed higher up on
the list.

There is a committee in charge
of making sure that each child is
placed in his or her rightful posi-
tion on the list. I hope, for Ron-
nie’s sake and their sake, that
Ronnie doesn't have to be placed
at the bottom of that list. There's
a good chance that 25 of those 90
kids on the waiting list at Chil-
dren's are going to die before
they can get transplants.

You probably won't hear much
about any of the kids who die.
Unless one of them is Ronnie.

Ronnie's mother, Maria
DeSillers, was quoted by The As-
sociated Press as saying,_ "Every
successful case I've heard of has
had a lot of media coverage.
Others have fallen through the
cracks [and the children have
died]  I don't want Ronnie to be
a case that falls through the
cracks.”

A spokesman from Children's
Hospital said that priority in
receiving livers when they be-
come available is based strictly
on urgency. All the media cover-
age in the world supposedly
won't get Ronnie a liver. But it
gothim on the list. He needed
$162,000 to get on the. waiting
list. Remember, he only had
$89,000 last week.’

Technically, Ronnie owes his
life to athief. I guess he really
owes it to all the little school chil-
dren who raised the $4,000 in
the first place, but if it hadn't
been stolen,_Ronnie would still
be in Florida.

If I ever wanted to perform a
really huge public service, I could
go around robbing money from
little children who need trans-
plants. .’

Is anyone else having trouble
dealing with the fact that Mr. (or
Ms.) Slimeball Thief is turning out
to be Hero of the Year?

There are probably a lot of kids
who couldn't raise the $162,000
to get placed on a waiting list.
President Reagan didn't send
them $1,000. They probably
didn't even get a photograph of
Vice President Bush. Not too
many people are going to hear
about it when any of them die.

Ronnie DeSillers lucked out.

I They didn't.
I hope Ronnie writes a thank- «

you note to Mr. Slimeball when
he gets better.

There is a new fashion
accessory being marketed
for the modern woman. It is
not a necklace, a brooch or
a bracelet.

It is a jeweled beeper.

    

The company that is sell- ,
ing the jeweled beepers is _ _,
called Stay In Touch. The '
beepers sell for $45. Eight
rhinestones decorate each
beepen

"What do you do with a
beeper?" said Barbara . 
Miller, the womanwho designed it; "You wear it. So when a
woman wears it, it should look like a piece of jewelry.”

Miller is the vice president of Harlan Advertising in Cleveland.
She got the idea for the jeweled beeper when she began to think
about the common stereotype of beepers. -

"If you think of a person who wears a beeper, you think of
either a doctor or a plumber," Miller said- "You don't think
of average working women and mothers carrying beepers. But
that's about to change, and the way to make it change is to turn
the beeper‘ into a fashion item.'’ ‘

Miller started carrying a beeper herself because of a family
problem. ''I have a daughter who is a diabetic," she said. "She
became a diabetic at the age of 9. I became" hysterical. So I
bought a beeper because I wanted the school to be able to con-.
tact me at any time. I didn't want the school making decisions
about her health without talking to me. .

’'It was then that I found out that women didn't relate to beep-
ers. So many stories about beepers have been negative and
snide. I decided it was time to change the image of beepers.
When you look at a beeper as just a piece of gray plastic, it
doesn't do much for you. But when you put jewels on it, it be-
comes a very attractive item for for a woman.”

The whole thing, of course, can be looked upon as yet another
commentary about life in the '80s. Can we imagine our mother's
generation of women walking around with jeweled beepers at-
tached to their clothing?

"Of courseﬁyou can’t,” Miller.said. ”But_our. mothers,w_er_e, , 

always at home. Mothers today aren't at home so much. Think’

about it. How many mothers do you know who are at home _' if I  A

all the time? What mother can you reach at home?

"I have another daughter, a teen-ager, who works out. One
Saturday night she was working on a Nautilis machine, and she
injured herself. My husband and I were out with friends, and
my beeper went off. , A _ .

”One of our friends said, ’Who would want to be bothered
on a Saturday night?’ And I said, ‘I would.’ Because I want to.
know if there's any problem with my children. I immediately
went to a phone and called home and helped my daughter to
get medical help.” 8

. The jeweled beepers are being test marketed in several cities .

as Valentine's Day gifts. The big push is scheduled to come in
May. when they are nationally marketedas Mother's Day gifts. -

”Right now there are between 3 and 5 million beepers be-
ing used in the United States," Miller said. "By 1990, it is esti-
mated that there will be 20 million beepers in use. Now ask
yourself — are those 20 -million beeper users going to be
doctors? ‘

"Of course not. And if jewels are what it takes to make a beep-
er a feminine product, then that's how we'll do it. If Lee lacoc—
ca can listen to women when he designs his cars, then beeper
manufacturers can listen to women, too." , -_

She predicts that the day will soon come when women wear-
ing jeweled beepers are as common a sight as women wearing
high heels. ”Let’s say that you have elderly parents whom you're
concerned about,” she said. "You can go to" the mall and- buy
a pair of stockings and go on with your life. You don't have
to worry about your parents because they can beep you at any
time.” . ‘

She said that she could not physically leave the house these
daysjwithout taking her jeweled beeper. "My throat closes up 5

when |'don't have it,” she said. ”-My life revolves around it.', ‘

"The jewels define it. I know that no one is going to come

up to me and ask me if I'm a doctor. I don't want to be mis- .. j 

taken for a doctor. I just want to be seen as a workingwoman .
and a concerned mother.”

She forsees the day when the jeweled beepers will be sold if

in non-traditional settings. "I want them to become a boutique

item," she said. ’’I want women to be able to buy them in beauty _

shops.” -

Miller said that she chose rhinestones for the beepers because
the rhinestones are inexpensive and are being chosen to high-
light many women's fashions these days.

"But I'm not committed to using only rhinestones on the beep-
ers,” she said. "Next year I may do something with pearls.”

Q. I have managed to remain a
virgin to the age of 32 because
of my religious beliefs — not be-
cause I lack passion for women.
Ijust stop at the kissing level. My
big problem is finding a mate

who shares these beliefs. I have '

been called all kinds of names by
dates who insist that my behavior

_ is a rejection of them personally

or as algender. Talk about role
reversal! I would like to settle

« down with someone who has

similar values to mine. Please ad-
vise me how I am to go about
this. Sexuality is not something
one advertises.

A. Well, now, I don't agree with
you about that. It seems to me
that you would do well to adver-
tise — even in the personals
column of some papaer or maga-
zine, even one where people
specify their sexual preferences
— because there definitely are
lots of -women out there who

._ claim to be looking for a man like
you: heterosexual, virginal and

religious, sticking to values little
understood in the bar scene.

 

- ‘I

How do I know. there are wom-
en looking for that? Because ev-
ery time I answer a letter from a
man such as you, I get many let-
ters asking for the fellow’s ad-
dress. These women' claim to
have been looking for men just
like you, as if a male of strict be-
liefs were El Doradoof the Foun-
tain of Youth.

Usually I tell someone like you
to look for someone you want in
places where women like that to
congregate —- in congregations. I
am a little mystified how a man
can get to be as religious as you
and not know any nice religious
women. Where do you pratice
your religion —- in a cave? Well,
you have the right, but you are
most ‘likely to meet a mate
around a church or synagogue. A
religion with only one adherent
is a lonely one. ' .

Sometimes a person tells me
that he or she has church or syn-
agogue affiliations, attends serv-
ices regularly, does volunteer
work for that place of worship,
belongs to groups connected

with it, but doesn't meet Miss or
Mr. Right there.

That is why I suggest trying the
dating service or the personal ads
column. It would be an ex-
perience and adventure even if
you don't meet your future wife
through it. Maybe you could
write a book or build a stand-up
comedy act around it. And it is a
perfectly OK way to meet the
kind of person you want to meet.

I can't do what many readers
ask of me and make this column
a matchmaking service. But there
are papers and magazines that do
operate such columns, and there
are services with phone numbers.
In the suburban Yellow Pages I
have at hand, I see several entries
under Dating Services and one is
a Christian Dating Service, Non-
Denominational. Another of in-
terest to me in my work is Dat-

THE‘ PITT NEWS, Wednesday, February I8, 1987

ing for Disabled. Another states
it is for all ages and religions.
Mentioning religion means it is
for people like you, not exclu-
sively for agnostics or the sexu-
ally permissive.

I have to add one thing. So
often a ‘man or woman will tell
me that he or she is the only vir-
gin or the only believer in pre-
marital chastity in the Western

Hemisphere. If you think that,‘

you are so, so wrong. There are
lots of people with traditional
feelings and values right now,
and nobody knows this like
someone who counsels people

_ about sex and relationships.

Q. A very neat young man just
got a job where I work, and
we've really hit it off. We’ve gone
for coffee a few times after work.
I'm attracted to him but get the
feeling he may be gay. I enjoy his
friendship, but is there any way
I could go about finding his sex-
ual preference without embar-
rassing either him or myself?

A. I don't think so, because’ you
are a little embarrassed already.

If you weren't, you would have
asked him already, possibly em-
barrassing him, but not yourself.
I do not believe in going around
and asking people their sexual
preference. Believe it or not, I am
old-fashioned, inhibited and shy
about asking somebody, ”Are
you gay or what?”

Sol can get on the air and talk
about sex insspecific terms — the
person asking the question wants
to talk about that and brought the
subject up. I really believe in sex-
ual information being disseminat-
ed for the good of all, but not in
intruding on someone else’s sen-
sibilities.

You may know some men who
are frank about being gay and a
fewrothers who don't get mad if
somebody asks, ”Are you gay?”
even though they aren't gay. But
it is still a question you have no
right to ask another person who
has in no way given you permis-
sion to ask. I '

This is still a world, as far as I
am concerned, where a person
can have coffee with me without
implying that he is interested
romantically or that he wants a
mutual exchange to go so far,as
”What is your sexual
preference?” .

Whatever personal information
he doesn't want to volunteer is
not my business. I can guess all
I want; that is my business. But
I have no right to interrogate like
a cop or demand information like
a conversational mugger. I think
you can use the same rules I use
until you have your own rules
you are comfortable with.

' You really find yourself attract-
ed to this man — being neat does
not make him gay, of course —
and you hit off so well. Let me say
that it is a good sign when you
feel that drawn to someone, and
it is also good ' that you show
some caution in hurling yourself
at him and declaring your feel-
ings and asking him to marry you.

As for hitting it off so well with
him, women oftendo hit it‘ off
well with gay men, and one rea-
son is that the man is not strong-
ly aroused by the woman, is not
being careful about showing his
interest, is not tongue-tied in the
presence of one he finds over-
whelmingly desirable. On the
contrary, he is at ease in the
presence of someone it is safe to
be seen with, someone who
perhaps shares his interest in art
or antiques or clothes.

If you have a nice, enjoyable
relationship with this guy at this
conversational level, I say enjoy
it but expect no more. It does not
matter if he is gay and not in-
terested in you ‘romantically or
straight but saving himself for
some fabulous female who won't
probably show up begging to go
to bed. ‘

The point is that he goes so far
and no further with you, shows

- affection for you at a no-hands,

no-commitment level. That is all
you need to know. This guy has
no right to claim your attention,
no right to lay claim to your°time.

There remains one little
problem. You may not find it easy
to overcome your own feelings
toward him. It happens that wom-
en sometimes ”choose” a certain
man and can't give up the idea
that he is rightfully theirs. Even if
he avoids them frankly or rude-
ly, even if they have evidence

that he is not interested in wom_- ._

Amerika
Soviet ambassador

By Mark Knoller

Associated Press Writer

WASHINGTON — A Soviet
diplomat criticized the television
mini-series Amerika as ”the worst
TV production possible” and said
the program —”one of the most
unfortunate products of the Cold
War” — had put him to sleep.

”Thisfilm, Amerika, is definite-
ly aimed at instigating hatred,”
charged Oleg Benyukh, a coun-
selor at the Soviet Embassy and
head of its information office. ’’It

66

It is a production

with the most mali-
cious intent.
— Oleg Ben yukh

is a production with the most ma-
licious intent.”

Benyukh spoke at a news con-
ference Tuesday that was‘ fol-

- Churkin,

decries movie

lowed by interviews conducted
by satellite between the em-
bassy’s first secretary, Vitaly
and local TV
newscasters around the nation.

Churkin said he found the

mini—series little more than
”laughable” anti-Soviet
propaganda.

Benyukh said he didn't want to
discuss the artistic merits of the
mini-series. After the conference
ended, however, he confided in
a reporter that ’’I fell asleep sever-
al times” while watching part two

Monday night.

The 14-hour made-for-TV
movie, being broadcast this week
by ABC, depicts life in 1997
America, 10 years after a Soviet
takeover. Soviet rulers are por-
trayed as cruel and callous, deter-
mined to crush any Americans
who might try to overthrow their
Russian masters.

”We feel it serves very negative
and sinister purposes — that of
continuing to fan anti-Soviet feel-
ings to perpetuate the enemy im-
age,” said Churkin.

Aluminum cans helping burn victims

’ By Ron Ball

For The Pitt News

Alcoa, West Penn Hospital and
firefighters in five counties are
working together to raise money
for young burn victims through a
program called Aluminum Cans
for Burned Children.

Both paid and volunteer fire-
fighters are involved with Cans
for Kids. Over 300 fire stations in
Allegheny, Washington, Beaver,
Westmoreland and Butler coun-
ties have undertaken the project.

Over $35,000 has been raised
since‘ August of 1985' when
representatives from Alcoa ap-
proached the International As-
sociation of Firefighters Local No.
l with the idea.

Joseph Nicole|laJr., a volunteer
fireman with South Strabane

~ Township No. 2 Volunteer Fire

Department in Washington
County and a communications
major at Pitt, initiated the pro-
gram in his fire department. He

now works for Alcoa coordinat-
ing the project efforts of the fire
departments and Alcoa.

”Each of the participating fire
stations serves as a drop-off
center where people can leave
their used aluminum cans,” said
Nicolella. Alcoa donates approx-
imately 30 cents a pound, de-
pending on the current market
price, into the Aluminum Cans
for Burned Chi-Idren fund.

The money raised is ad-
ministered by the West Penn
Hospital Foundation for a varie-
ty of different uses. The hospital
uses the fund to buy non-medical
items and to assist the families of
young patients in its burn/trauma
center in Pittsburgh. -Each patient
in the center receives a bag con-
taining various toiletry items, a
stuffed puppet, crayons and a
coloring book. »

_”They buy toys, special
clothes, anything that will make
their stay a little less frightening,”
said Nicolella. The fund also pro-

vides the parents with gas money
or covers lodging» expenses if the
parents live too far away to visit
regularly.

Terry Brooker, coordinator for
West Penn Hospital added, ’’The
ACBC program just tries to help
wherever [it] can.”

Nicolella said that standard
toys like bicycles and paints are
sometimes purchased because
they might help the kids regain
use of their bodies in ways that
may i not seem like therapy.
”Paints might help get burned
fingers moving again,” said
Nicolella. -

August 1986 marked the first
anniversary of the program and,
to help celebrate the event, Alcoa

matched the contributions with '

an additional $35,000.
Nicolella said that since he has
been working with the program,
he has been contacted by sever-
al schools, church groups and lo-
cal businesses wanting to get
involved with Aluminum Cans

Floating not only feels good it is good. Hospital studies reveal floating is successful
"treatment for many physical ailments. It stimulates the production of endorphins (the body's
own opiates) while reducing adrenal activity associated with stress and heart disease.
Floating has been successfully used in treating anxiety, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal
ailments, migrane. and tension headaches. hypertension and chronic pain. It's the natural.
drug-free way to better health.‘ Floating has had positive results in behavior modification.
Preliminary research indicates floating causes a reduction or elimination of habits such
as smoking, drinking and drug usage. Floating is particularly effective in counteracting
addiction withdrawal symptoms. It can help you through the discomfort of quitting addictive

HARRISBURG — Not long

ago, nearly everyone in the
Capitol seemed to focus on what
should be done with the state—run
liquor monopoly.
‘ The story was front-page news
throughout Pennsylvania during
the waning days of the legislative
last November. Some
predicted chaos if no solution
was found by the Dec. 31 dead-
line for the Liquor Control Board
to expire and begin a six-month
phase—out period.

The deadline _came and went,
along with a court decision up-
holding the Sunset Law requiring
the LCB to eventually shutdown
if no legislative agreement, was
found.

3 ANALYSIS

The liquor system, however,
still is doing business as usual,
although the board is technical-
ly in the ”phase—out period.”

There still isn't a final answer,
and the topic isn't generating
nearly as much publicity or in-
terest these days. Gov. Robert P.
Casey wants to keep the LCB
with some changes, but he has
said the issue isn't his top priority.

A few lawmakers have again
proposed legislation ranging from
keeping the LCB in its current
form to turning over the liquor
business to private enterprise.

If that sounds similar to things
heard last year — before the flur-..,

 Despite’ phase o.ut’,LCBsti ll i n force

ry of activity that caused a com-

motion but didn't: end in a

compromise —— you're correct.
The current situation, however,

is different in one major way:.

Casey sits in the chair previously
occupied by Gov. Dick Thorn-
burgh. Thornburgh wanted to
abolish the current system, a
stand most lawmakers from his
own political party didn’t.even
share.

The Democrats take a more.

moderate approach than Thorn-
burgh, looking toward the middle
ground of reform.

Supporters of. reforming the ‘

LCB generally have sought such
things as shifting responsibility for
enforcing the ‘liquor code to

another agency such as the state '

‘police, allowing credit cardsales
and improved marketing of

products.

Key lawmakers say a‘combina—
tion of thoseitems is likely to be-
come part of a compromise.
Some even say that solution will
be agreed to with much time to
spare before July 1, when the
LCB apparently must close dow
for good. » _ —

But many, including tavern

owners, are beginning to ‘worry 

about the paucity of open discus-
sions and the fear of a return to
prohibition if a. compromise can't
be found.

Casey, in response to a recent
question, confidently said his ad-
ministration will resolve the issue
”expeditiously" and within the
time allotted.

If he can pull it off, itwould be
a good start to dealing with a po-
litically divided Legislature. .

HARRISBURG — A legisla-
tive package being prepared
by the Casey. administration
will recommend significant
changes to the Liquor Control I
Board, according to a letter
Tuesday from Gov. Robert P.
Casey's office.

The administration intends
to ”very shortly” proposeits
LCB reform package, accord-
ing to the Feb. 17 letter from
Casey's office to Rep. Eugene
Saloom, chairman of the
House Liquor Control Com-

' mittee. '

”The administration is con-

vinced that significant reforms

Casey proposes LC B reforms

to the current system are
necessary and is working cur-
rently to develop a reform
proposal,” said the letter, writ-
ten by Richard D. Speigelman,
the governor's chief deputy
general counsel for agency
liaison. ’ .

Casey has said the board
should be retained, but until
now has not committed his
office to proposing its own
plan. Last week, Casey said he
planned to take a more active
role in the LCB issue.

The governor has indicated
he wanted some consumer-
related and other changes in

. the board, but the letter didn't

specify what reforms would be
included in the proposal.

Members of the House~Li-
quor Control Committee in re-
cent weeks have been
wrangling over proposals
designed to restore the LCB.
The board, unless re-
established by the Legislature,
will go out of businessjune 30 .
under the state Sunset Law.

The administration letter
said Casey intended to work
with the committee and
House and Senate leadership
to reach a solution in advance
of the termination date.

”The administration expects
very shortly to develop 3
responses to existing pro-
posals, plus its own reform
package. We are committed

Visitor to newsroom says Platoon is realistic

A man came to The Pitt
News last Monday concerned
about an AP story we printed
in which a house member
criticized the movie Platoon.

He wasn't angry so much
about the remarks made, as he
was about the lack of recogni-
tion that might be received by
those who actually did fight as
depicted in this movie. He left
before I could get his name,
but he gave me perhaps the
most realistic view of the war
in Vietnam I have ever heard.

In the AP story, Rep. Tom I
Ridge (R-Pa.) said: ”They prob-

ably didn't do any of the stuff

" in that movie. It upsets me. I

think Hollywood has exploited
the tension and makes it inhu-

I man and barbaric and cruel.”

According to the man who
visited, those things did hap-
pen, and they are a part of
war.

It seems war is inhuman, bar-
baric and cruel after all.

He said Ridge’s Americal Di-
vision was one division best
known for its lack of desire to
fight.

_ ”Nobody was ready for some-
thing like this to happen,” said
Barbano. ”It caught us off guard.
I just was hoping that he wouldn't
use the gun.”

Bricker opened the front door I

of the register office. The robber
then told the three to open up the
safes and lay down on the floor.

When Bricker said he couldn't
open the safe, the robber placed

the gun to Bricker’s head. At this

point Bricker told the robber
which safe was open.

The robber went to the safe and
removed $1,000. He then told
Bricker to open the other two
safes inside the register office.
Bricker replied that there was no
money in the other registers be-
cause they had already emptied
them. ’ -

At this point the other robber

told the man in the register office -

to hurry. The robber in the office
told the three‘ employees to stay
on the floor. The two robbers left

police reports they were last seen

He said he fought in Viet-

‘ nam for four years beginning
. in 1964. He was part of a spe-

cial forces group consisting of
men who volunteered to fight
in the war. A

The point he hoped to make
to me involved the subtle
difference between those who
fought and those who served.

”There were many men who
went there only to serve,” he
said. ”God bless them, but
they were in an entirely differ-
ent part of the war.

down into one of_those things
and introduce yourself. Some-
times women and children
were killed, but he couldn't
just walk past them. That
might get him killed.”

He said he liked the film for
the realism it presents.

who served,” he said. ”A man
who was up at the front fight-
ing didn’t have time to do that
sort of thing.

”He knew he had to be alert
because he had to be ready at
all times. If you weren't alert,
you cou_ld be killed.” ‘

The man was very clean and
neatly dressed. His crew cut
and wire-rimmed glasses gave
him the air of a military man,
but his attitude was not that of
a warmonger. He seemed ner-

. vous at coming up to this

office.

”I just think if you print
something like that, there
should be an opportunity for
rebuttal,” he said.‘ ”There were
many men who’ died in that
war that never received recog-

”They listed a certain
amount of casualties as killed
in action, but thousands more
died outside Vietnam from
typhoid fever or wounds after
they left combat.”

He spoke quickly and quiet-
ly. I was distracted at one
point and looked away for a
moment.

”Are you interested?” he
suddenly said.

I said I was and offered him
a chair which he reluctantly
took. He often pointed to a
rolled-up issue of The=Pitt
News as he spoke. When I
asked him questions about his
own service, he answered
them quickly and jumped back
to the experience of those who
fought.

Our conversation ended sud-
denly when two other editors
approached the area. He didn't
pause to say good-bye or make
a special request for some
rebuttal to the statements made
by the House member. He was
gone before I could think of

_ what to say.

I've talked to many people
about the war in Vietnam.
Most of those I've spoken to
were against the war. Those
who were there and supported
the U.S. presence were often
too off-the—wall to make me
feel what they were saying
was worthwhile. '

Violence aside, Platoon
leaves one with a very heavy

feeling. There is great frustra-

tion at finally seeing what
soldiers actually must do to
survive a war. »

This man was there, and he
fought. He doesn't want spe-
cial recognition or sympathy.
He only wants the respect of
those who weren't there and
the respect ‘of those who
served the men who fought.

”A lot of people go to the
movie and think what they're
seeing is what they did,” he
said. ”But of the thousands
who went over’ there, only a

small number did actual fight- I

ing, the majority served.

”I just want to make sure
that gets printed, too.”

  emories of explosion at Langley remains,

Langley Hall as it was after explosion 10 years ago.

By Darrin Mesick
For The Pitt News

After all the rubble was cleared
from the Langley Hall exposion
10 years ago, there were two
people dead and 68 injured.

Most Pitt students are unaware
that this blast, one of the most
tragic events in the university's
history, even occurred.

It happened about 12:40 p.m.
Jan. 20, 1977. Kathleen Vergona
was lecturing on insulin in a
physiology in room 223 of Lan-
gley. Suddenly the room started
to shake.

Harry Tedrow, a student in the
class recalled, ”There was a
deep, rumbling noise, almost like
thunder or a jet.” Then he heard
a ”violent|y loud noise and a lot
of air began to rush in.”»

class turned around, they saw, in-
stead of a back wall and ceiling,
a bright blue sky.

Tedrow also remembered see-
ing ”a geyser of water where one
of the water pipes had broken.”

People started screaming and
yelling. Some sought safety from
the falling glass and debris under
their wooden seats. Vergona hid
under her lecturn. The rest of the
students who were able to walk
rushed for the exit doors at the
front of the class. Then there was
a rush of gas into the room.

Tedrow said, ”As you breathed

Some of the students had trou-
ble finding their way out. At that
time, to leave the class rooms,
one had to pass through the front
doorway, turn left, go up the
stairs and then turn right to get to
the exit doors. So a few students
stayed behind to direct people
out.

An army of police, firemen and
paramedics met the students as
they found their way out of the
building. Since the rescue people

had, no idea how many people

 

Langley Hall, 10 years after exp|osioRr'LSC°” C°'"°h°”/The Pi" News

were injured and of the extent of
the injuries, they couldn't im-
mediately leave with the less se-
verely injured victims. They told
those students that they could

_ either wait or walk over to th

hospital emergency rooms them-
selves. A few even found rides
from passersby.

The blast was believed to have
originated in the electron micro-
scope and behavioral psycholo-
gy labs beneath the lecture halls.
A secretary, Carleen Curry, was
on the phonetalking to her farni,-
ly at the time of the explosion.
She was killed instantly.

«.3

Nineteen claims for lost materi-
als and medical bills were filed
against the university, the con-
structor of the building, Mellon-
Stuart and Equitable Gas Compa-
ny. They were filed together in
one suit. Two years later, on the
day the jury was to be selected,
the parties settled out of court. No
one was proved liable for the ex-
plosion. ‘

However, an investigation con-
cluded the blast was caused by
an old Equitable gasline under
the street in front of’ Langley.
Although the gasline was no
longer being used, it still con-
tained gas, which leaked out of
the pipe through small cracks in
the line. The gas seeped through
the ground to Langley and some-
how ignited.

Bush forms committee to prepare
plans for '88 presidential race

WASHINGTON (AP) ~ Vice
President George Bush will an-
nounce Thursday the formation
of his presidential campaign com-
mittee, a political aide said
Tuesday.

Creation of the committee will
be a major step toward Bush's
1988 presidential candidacy.

Rich Bond, a Bush political ad-
viser, who will be deputy cam-
paign manager, said the vice
president will formally announce
his candidacy sometime ‘after

‘Labor Day. ,

Among other Republican aspir-
ants, Rep. Jack Kemp of New
York recently formed a campaign
committee, and _former Gov.
Pierre S. du Pont IV of Delaware
got the jump on the entire field
by becoming a declared candi-
date last September.

Reagan lifts sanctions
on Poland after appeals

WASHINGTON (AP) -— Presi-
dent Reagan has decided to lift
U.S. economic sanctions against,
Poland in response to reforms un-
dertaken by the -Communist
government and appeals from
Polish church and trade union
leaders, adminstration officials
said Tuesday.

The decision was accelerated
by a recent trip to Warsaw by
Deputy Secretary of State John C.
Whitehead for talks with Gen.
Wojciech Jaruzelski, the Polish

‘leader, and a broad spectrum of -

Polish church and labor figures.
”Everyone said lift the sanc-

tions,” a U.S. official said. ’’It

seems the time had come.”

The sanctions, which cut into
Poland's trade with the United
States and involved other restric-
tions, were imposed in 1981 in
response to the impositionof
martial law in the Eastern Europe-
an country. ‘

Three conditions were set for
removing them: lifting of martial
law, release of political prisoners
and progress toward reconcilia-
tion between the government
and segments of Polish society,
including the trade union
movement.

”lt’s not a reward to the Poles
as such,” the official said.

He pointed out that since mar-

tial law was lifted in 1983, there _

have been two releases of politi-
cal prisoners, and reconciliation
had begun.

An announcement of Reagan’-5
decision is expected by the end
of the week.

The United States moved to im-
pose sanctions on Poland on
Dec. 23, 1981, 10 days after mar-
tial law was declared. U.S. trade
with the Eastern European coun-
try dropped from $1 billion in
1979 to an estimated $400 mil-
lion last year.

Reagan suspended Polish fish-
ing privileges in U.S. waters,
landing rights for Polish commer-
cial aircraft and new government
financial credits to Poland. The
fishing and commercial aircraft
sanctions were lifted on Jan. 19,
1984.

On Jan. 11, 1982, NATO allies
joined in the U.S. sanctions, sus-
pendingofficial credits for non-
food items and negotiations on
rescheduling Poland's debt. On
Oct. 9, 1982, Reagan suspended
Poland's most-favored nation
trading status.

LaRouche followers
Indicted In Virginia
LEESBURG, Va. (AP) — A state
grand jury Tuesday indicted 16
followers of political extremist
Lyndon H. LaRouche on felony
securities fraud and other
charges. ‘_
A state prosecutor said the
charges stemmed from the sale of
notes and other securities on be-
half of LaRouche-related organi-
zations and involved a portion of
$30 million in allegedly fraudu-
lent - solicitations over several
years. P
State and city police and Lou'-
doun County Sheriff's deputies
began arresting the LaRouche fol-
lowers Tuesday evening at their
homes and at LaRouche’s head-
quarters in Leesburg, about 30
miles outside Washington.

Also indicted were five
LaRouche-related organizations,
said Sheriff's Lt. Terry
McCracken.

LaRouche himself was not
charged, authorities said.

McCracken said all were
charged with multiple counts of
securities fraud, sale of un-
registered securities and selling
securities" as an unregistered
agent

Prosecutor William Burch said
each was a felony carrying a max-
imum two to 10 years inrprison.

Burch said he did not know
how much money was involved
in the charges but that investiga-
tors had found that $30 million
had been raised by LaRouche
fund-raisers ”through similar
transactions” over several years.
He said they involved soliciting
a loan or sale of a promissory
note in which the person selling
the note was not registered with
the state and made false or mis-
leading representations.

Burch said that figure and the
arrests were based on financial
records and -other evidence
seized by state and federal agents

in a raid at LaRouche headquart-

ers last Oct. 6.

Dana Scanlon, spokeswoman
for LaRouche, charged that the ar-
rests were part of a ”political
vendetta.”

STATE COLLEGE, Pa. (AP) -
An indecent assault charge
against a_ former Blair County

. judge has been dropped because

of insufficient evidence afterthe
alleged victim refused to testify,

a district magistrate said Tuesday.

Former Judge Richard A.
Behrens could have faced up to
a $5,000 fine and two years in
prison if convicted, but the case
never passed the preliminary
hearing stage because the
16-year-old alleged victim
changed her mind about cooper-
ating with prosecutors.

”I found there was not suffi-
cient evidence to bind the defen-
dant over, so I dismissed the
charges,” State College District
Magistrate Clifford Yorks said.
Yorks assumed the case after Blair
County judicial officials disquali-

 

OU

fied themselves.

York said he dismissed the
charge last week, adding that offi-
cial notice of his decision would
be received by the district attor-
ney’s office either Wednesday or
Thursday.

Blair County District Attorney
William J. Haberstroh said he had
not received the notice, but that
it ”doesn’t come as any great
surprise.

”I think my greatest disappoint-
ment came when the little girl
wouldn't testify,” he said.

In a related development, a
State College psychologist in-
volved in the Behrens’ case and
charged with violatingstate law
for not reporting suspected child
abuse will have a hearing on the
summary offense Feb. 24.

Karl Bartsch learned of the

 Assault charge against former judge dropped

abuse allegations from the girl's
mother on March 9, 1985, but
failed to file the necessary report
as specified by the'Child Protec-
tive Services Law, state police at
Hollidaysburg said in the citation
filed with Yorks.

under way on the LCB issue
and that a proposal to extend

Two bills have been in-

Transplant Surgeonhonored

Thomas E. Starzl, M.D., direc-
tor of Transplant Services at
Presbyterian-University_Hospital
of Pittsburgh and professor of sur-
gery at the University fo Pitts-
burgh School of Medicine, was
inducted as honorary fellow of
the Royal College of Surgeons of
Ireland last Saturday. The confer-
ring ceremony took place in Dub-
lin, Ireland, prior to the'Charter
Day Dinner held by the college.

Since it was established in“

1784, the Royal College of Sur-
geons has recognized fewer than
30 American surgeons with
honorary fellowships. The col-
lege honors its peers from Ireland
and around the world.

His induction as an honorary
fellow of the Royal College of
Surgeons of Ireland now adds to
a growing list of honors and
achievements for Starzl. In 1984,
Starzl was inducted as an
honorary fellow of the Royal Col-
lege of Surgeons of England. He
was the 1985 recipient of the
Pennsylvania Medical Society
Distinguished Service Award and
was named Pittsburgh Man of the
Year in I981 and I986. Starzl has
now received over 50 awards by
his peers and civicorganizations
in recognition of his contributions
to medicine and science.

In the course of almost 30 years
of work, Starzl has continuously

contributed to the science and art V

of transplantation and has applied
this knowledge in order to im-
prove patient care.

He began his work in trans-
plantation on. animal models in
1958. With knowledge gained
from renaltransplantation, Starzl
performed the first successful hu-
man liver transplant in 1967.
Since moving to Pittsburgh in
1981, he has led the develop-
ment on one of the world's most
successful multiple-organ trans-
plantation programs. With his
team, Starzl has completed half
the world's liver transplants.

The combination of his surgical
skills with his continual refine-
ment of post-operative patient

care protocols has made trans-

plantation of the liver a success-
ful form of clinical therapy.

Starzl also played a crucial role
in the introduction of the previ-
ously experimental immunosup-

. pressant drug, Cyclosporine, into_
federally—approved clinical trials.

Cyclosporine is now recognized

Dr.iThomas Starzl, Professor of Surgery, School of Medicine.

as the cornerstone in post-
operative transplant care and has
dramatically increased transplant
survival rates.

Starzl has contributed toward
the concepts and practice of
multi-organ transplantation. He
has revolutionized the entire field
of hepatology, providing a better
understanding of disease process-
es and developing new technol-
ogies to combat them.

Under the guidance of Starzl,_

Presbyterian-University Hospital
has completed over 2,000 trans-
plant procedures and last year led
the nation in the number of liver,
heart and heart/lung transplants
as well as uses of the artificial
heart.

Transplant

Continued from page 1

I ' da read: ”We,HaveJust Begun!” '

  

Ms. DeSillers said the boy was
aware of the testing ahead and
that doctors will have to search
for a donor liver if he is eligible

. for a transplant.

”He said, ’I’m worried that they

A won't be able to find a liver for
-me,’” the mother said.

Ronnie was relatively
unknown outside the Miami area
until the money raised by his

.-

classmates to help pay for the
costly operation was stolen.

The money was part of
$89,000 raised at that point for
the boy, who needed $162,000
to get onto the transplant waiting
list. Medical costs could total
$300,000 to $500,000, an ex-
pense that his mother, a single
parent, can't meet.

Reagan called Ronnie last Fri-

' day to pledge $1,000 after hear-

ing of the theft from Vice

President George Bush, who had
learned of it from his son, Jeb,
Florida's secretary of commerce.

Donations then poured in from
businesses and individuals, in-
cluding Miami Beach millionaire
industrialist Victor Posner, who
pledged $200,000.

The boy's flight to Pittsburgh
on an air ambulance, which nor-
mally costs $6,000, also was do-
nated Pegasus Air Ambulance of
Fort Lauderdale. "

 THE PITT News, Wednesday, February 18, 1987

”Everyone was in favor of it. At
the time it seemed rather bleak 
like every hope he had went out
like a thief in the night,” ex-
plained Pegasus owner, Capt.
Kenneth Mulford, who flew the
jet. ‘
When the DeSillers left Fort
Lauderdale," 16 of Ronnie's first-
grade classmates waved solemn-
ly as several relatives cried.

Ronnie said in Fort Lauderdale
that he was ready and looking
forward to what his mother said
was his first plane trip. Dr. Angel
Cadiz, Ronnie's physician, and a
nurse also flew with him.

He wore a t-shirt that read:
”Pittsburgh Please Help Me.”

A Miami Police SWAT team,
which helped raise money, es-
corted his ambulance from Mia-
mi Children’s Hospital. Also
there to see him off was Lisa Mot-
tram, representing Posner.

”We want to see Ronnie,” said
Stephanie Roberts, age 6, one of
his classmates wearing their blue
St. Anthony's Roman Catholic
School uniforms. ”We say pray-
ers for him every day.”

News of the theft from St. An-
thony’s school last week helped
ignite the massive fund—raising ef-
fort by radio deejays, office wor-
kers, fast-food employees and
dozens others.

But while one hurdle has been

cleared, a second remains, said _

Miss McMahon. .

She said the most important
criteria in matching a liver is not
age or blood type, but rather
body weight. Livers tomatch
Ronnie's size must come from
other children, and few young-
sters carry donor cards, she said.

’’It is  more difficult to pro-
cure a donor organ for a child be-
cause what we need are small
organs and that just means there's
a smaller pool to draw from,”
Miss McMahon said. '

The decision as to which child
will receive a donor organ,

should a suitable one become

available, is decided ”strictly on
the basis of urgency” by the Pitts-

- burgh Transplant Foundation, she

said.

Children's Hospital of Pitts-
burgh it has performed 389 liver
transplants on children, more
than any other hospital in the
world, since the program began

«' almost six years ago.

The hospital currently performs
about 65 liver transplants a year
”and every single one of those
patients is as special as Ronnie,”
said Miss McMahon. 3

lohnson said that prior to the
robbery she had noticed two
black males wearing dark eye-
glasses standing in front of the
door. She said they appeared to
have waved at a Lincoln town
car, possibly occupied by another
black male. Johnson said she
turned her head, and the next
thing she knew they were in th
store. '
I ’’I think it was impossible for us
to have called. the police while
they were in the store,” said
Coroda. ”We were all in the front
of the store. They were probably
inside for only five minutes, but
it seemed a lot longer.’’ ’ ,

Coroda sustained bruises in the
incident but no one else was hurt.

The robber carrying a knife was

large nose, 6-3, having a muscu-
lar build, approximately 230 lbs.,
wearing a blue ski mask with a

Pitt is shifting its summer
training camp to the Universi-

where it will conduct wor-

marks a return to the site
where Pitt practiced from

_ The following year, Pitt held
its summer camp at West

nine-year summer stay at Edin-

”The Pitt—Johnstown campus

has toured the Johnstown site
with Dr. Edward E. Bozik,

fine facilities and is in our sys-

‘ stem. I'm happy to stay in our
system, although we've had a
great relationship with the
Edinboro people.”

Bozik believes it is a practi-
cal and promising move for
the Pitt football team.

”We are very pleased to
return to our own campus at
the University of Pittsburgh at
Johnstown. We have the facil-
ities and field necessary to
conduct a first-rate summer
camp. The new fields comple-

we can rekindle the spirit of

Back in 1976, Pitt’s'senior
sensation Tony Dorsett won
the Heisman Trophy, Johnny
Majors was named the Coach

thers were ranked No. 1‘ in

In 1986, Coach Gottfried’s

said Bozik, ”for the excellent
hospitality and fine facilities
that were made available to us
over the past nine years.”

UPJ President Frank H.
Blackington III is pleased by
the return of the Panthers;
”We.are glad to have been
able to attract our Pitt Panther
football team back to the
Johnstown campus for this
summer camp after a 10-year
absence. I

”We believe the team will
find our facilities and person-
nel more than adequate to
meet their needs, and we hope
this will be the beginning of a
long term relationship with

their program."

Thirty minutes after the regular
practice had ended, one lone
Panther basketball player re-
mained. All he was doing was
shooting jump-shots, one after
another.

He said he is doing this to
regain the shooting stratas he
once had command of. But as of
late, he has been struggling.

He is averaging only 9.8 points
and shooting only 35 percent
from the field in Big East games.
Additionally, he has failed to
score in double figures in eight
games this year, compared with
only two such outings all last
season.

This solitary figure — who is
proving not only to his coach, but
to himself as well, that his cares
deeply about his team — is De-
metreus Gore.

”I’ve got to keep up my con-
centration,” huffed Gore as he
gasped down air. ’’If I can't make
the shots here in a practice, I'll
never be able to get them right in
a game.” .

_ Gore, who at the outset of this
season had every Pitt basketball
fan's expectations running high,
has seemed to some a disappoint-.
ment. With his shooting percen-

Get ready for a grudge match.
The Pittsburgh Panthers (21-4
overall; 10-2 in the Big East), cur-
rently ranked eighth in the nation
and first in the Big East Confer-
ence, have only lost two confer-
ence games. One was to Lou
Carnesecca’s flimsy-if-anything
Redmen of St. John's, and the
other was to the team they play
tonight. '
' Hoya Saxa, here comes Geor-
getown. ' _ ‘
”We really want to beat them,
we really want to win,” said
junior small-forward Demetreus
Gore. ”In the last game, they real-
ly took us by surprise. I don't
think they can do that again
tonight, but we can’t'take them
llightly.” V
When the Panthers lost 82-70
to the Hoyas on Jan. 10, Pitt
coach Paul Evans attributed one
of the Panthers’ main deficits to
the playing of a zone defense. As-

sistant coach Norm taw said this l

should change tonight.

”After looking at some of the
films, we can really see the mis-
takes we made defensively,” said
Law. ”What'we are really going
to do tonight is bone upon the
defense and instead of using the
zone the whole game, we're go-
ing to try and use some solid
man-to-man. This should enable
us to control the tempo as we

want it instead of how theywant . a

it." I

Law also said .on’ero_f.'the _mai_n_ .

year, some have even begun to
give up hope.

But not Gore.

”It’s a question of whether or
not I force_shots in a game or
whether I take the ones I «really
think I can make,” said Gore. ’’I
am glad to be in the position of
being able to choose the good
shots from the bad shots. And
basically, I think I've taken the
majority of the good shots that
have been open to me. This is
what the coach orders, and this
is what I try to deliver.”

And order is what the coach

-does , .
”I keep telling him to shoot in-

telligently,” said Pitt coach Paul
Evans. ”By shooting intelligently,
he will not only help the team
win games butbring up his own
records as well. It's taken some
time, but he is finally catching

the Hoyas’ sta_r, 6-7 senior
forward. ,

”I’m not sayingthat Williams
is their whole team,” said Law,
”but he is their main power-
house. If we can slow him down,
or hopefully even stop him, then

_we’ve taken one of their keys

away from them.”

   
   
  

..«1.-._ e , 2 . a . .;1.
. . , ..

 

But Evans and his entire coach-4'

ing staff feels Gore still has a long .

way to go before he regains‘ the
status he once had. Panther assis-
tant coach Norm Law said he
feels Gore is a very good player
whose one major problem is con-
sistency. ' .

”Sure he's good, but he still has

a lot of work to do,” said Law. .

“He knows what it is like to do
well in a game, and he knows
what it is like ‘to win. The
problem this season is that his
good playing is coming only in
spurts. He has no real consisten-
cy. Once he regains this, he will,
be back to being the key player
everyone wants him to be.”
What is convenient for Gore,

however, is that the team he
plays for is winning games, and
this alone can prove a good bol-
ster for his own confidence. Gore

himself said he is comfortable .

with the team's standings over his
own, even though he is trying
anything he can to play his part
in those wins. ’ \ I '

.”With the 21 wins we have,
I'm really not too concerned
about mysown records,” said
Gore. ”The point is that there are
other players on the team who
are committed to winning as
much as I am. They are the ones

 It seems that every team des-

tined for greatness has had a nick-

. name orsome sort of hype to go

along with it.

Is Pitt destined for greatness?
Maybe. i

Do I have a nickname and
some other sort of hype to go
along with it? Of course not.

Let's analyze this team:

°There is a power forward
who leads the nation in rebound-
ing and comes to play every trip
down the court.

0 There is a center who used to
play power forward. He is great
at times, but weak at others.

0 There is a small forward from
Detroit who has the sweetest gold
chains this campus has seen since
football player Andy Lewis.

He also has the sweetest rap
video since Run-DMC’s "King of‘
Rock."

0 Don't forget the senior shoot-
ing guard who started off fast, but
has fizzled of late.

0 And then there is the sopho-
more point guard who improves
every time he steps on the court.

so what do we have?

There is nobody named Sam,
and no pets are allowed in the
residence halls, so that scratches
that slogan.

Demetreus Gore is the only
one who could get a bid from Phi
Slamma Jamma.

Panther Paranoia doesn't
sound right.

What are we left with?

The hype has to deal with Jer-
ome Lane and — as Curtis Aiken

  ‘    

calls him — Chaw-lee Smith.
Twin towers? Nah can't
seem to come up with anything.
How ’bout some individual
nicknames:
0 Lane likes to go by the han-
dle "Rome," which is nice. He

_ once told a Pitt Sports Informa-

tion intern, "This Rome wasn't
built in a day. This one will take
two years.”

It was peculiar how that quote

worked its wayjinto the Post-
Cazette, then into Sports Illus-
trated.

Regardless, Lane is like Windex
—— he cleans the glass. But he

does more than that. He is an ex-

We'll call him "Glass Plus.”

Four games separate Pittfrom leaguetitle

Now that the Big East season
has wound down to only one and
a half more weeks of hoop mad-
ness, it is time to analyze the con-
ference race, and ‘ more
particularly, what the Pitt Pan-
thers, with some help from a few
league rivals, have to do to win
the regular season title.

This column isn't going to be
pretty. If you expect words that
flow like water and phrases that
dance, don't bother reading fur-
ther. But, if you want to find out
what has to happen for Pitt to
lock up its first ever Big East regu-
lar season title — sit back and dig
in. A
For starters, it should be point-
ed out that the race basically in-
volves three teams — Pitt,
Syracuse and Georgetown. Provi-
dence, with only four league loss-
es, is still in the hunt, but the
Friars would have to pull off
major upsets at both Syracuse
and Georgetown to have a
chance.

St. John's has five league loss-
es, and that almost automatical-
ly eliminates them from any
chance- at a third consecutive
regular season title.

Why? Well, it's all quite sim-
ple. Believe me — barring, of
course, any major upsets the last
one and a half weeks of the sea-
son and some good ”home cook-
ing” in two tough games to

‘predict.

I It should be pointed out here
that what I'm going to offer is
pure conjecture and will only

hold true if I can correctly pick‘

the four games which will ulti-
mately decide Pitt's title fate.
Which isn't going to be easy. But,
here goes  '

0 The Panthers have a difficult
schedule the rest of the way.
Tonight they travel to Landover,
Md., to- play‘ third-place Geor-

getown at 8 p.m. On Saturday, -

Pitt plays at Connecticut and
returns home to Fitzgerald Field
House the following Monday to
host Villanova. The Panthers con-
clude the regular season on Feb.
28 at St. John's.

0 Syracuse's remaining games
aren't as easy as they look,
although the Orangemen play
three of their last four at the Car-
rier Dome against Providence,
Georgetown and Boston College.
But they still have to travel to
New York to play St. John's. Aha!
Louie Carnesecca sure knows
how to stack the home games

last four at home. Besides play-
ing Pitt tonight, the Hoyas host
Providence on the 28th. But they
still have to travel to upstate New
York for a game with Syracuse
this Sunday. Georgetown also
has an away game at Boston
College.

So for you Pitt fans out there
who are wondering what games
to key on the rest of the way, cir-
cle these dates and places on

your calendar, and if you have"

nerdy roomates who would
rather watch Jacques Cousteau,
well, reserve the television set
now or buy a ticket for these
games.

Pitt at Connecticut/Saturday,
Feb. 21 —— The Panthers in a
romp.

Villanova at Pitt/Monday, Feb.
23 — The Panthers win in a tight,
physical (for obvious reasons)
game. ,

I'm not disputing Pitt's ability
to win at Georgetown or St.
John's, but they can still win the
regular season title just by defeat-
ing the Huskies and Wildcats.

Here's why 

Georgetown at Syra-

cuse/Sunday, Feb. 22 — The.

Orangemen’s
prevails.

This would be the Hoyas’ fifth
league loss which would knock
them out of it.

Syracuse at St.
John's/Wednesday, Feb. 25 —« St.
John's revenges earlier loss to
Syracuse at Carrier Dome.

This would be only the fourth

inside game

league loss for the Orange, which

could still put them in a tie for
first with the Panthers. But, Pitt
would win the tie—breaker be-
cause it defeated Syracuse twice
during the regular season.

Ditto for Providence, if it can
somehow win its last three and
finish at 12-4.

Well, anyway, one may dis-
pute my claims, but believe me,

that's all it has to come down to
for the Panthers —— those four
games. Mind you, even one in-
correct prediction on my part will
change the title race drastically.

And if_ that happens, you'll
have to figure out the race your-
self because I'll be trying to hide
my face from these pages until af-
ter the season is over.

CURTIS‘ MKEN

By ‘Jeff Vargas
For The Pitt News '

The Lady Panthers basketball
team has had its share of bad luck

 this year, but there also have

been a few bright spots. One of
them is sophomore guard Leanne
Burkholder of Butler.

When you talk to her, she
seems a little shy, but when it
comes to basketball, she is any-

thing but.

As a senior at Butler High, she
averaged 21 points per game and
established herself as the third
leading rebounder in the school's
history. She was recruited by
several universities, among them
Ohio University, University of
Connecticut, Syracuse and Du-
quesne.

other schools, but due to a con-
flict with the coach, she trans-
ferred to Pitt.

’’I chose Pitt because I wanted
to stay close to home,” said Burk-
holder. ’’I like the atmosphere
better here than at Duquesne."

This past summer, Burkholder
worked as a counselor at the Blue
Star Girls’ Basketball Camp held
at Rutgers. She was a player at the
camp the summers before her
junior and senior years at Butler
High.

’’I like working there because
I get to see firsthand the talent
coming out of high school,”.said
Burkholder. ”The girls are much
better now than they were five
years ago. That just makes me
want to work much harder on my
game.”

ing well since transfering to Pitt.

'”I like Coach [Kirk]- Bruce,” she

said. ”He stresses team play. This
is the first team I've been on that
plays like a team and not five in-
dividuals.”

According to Bruce, ”Looking
at her stats, she does not play like
a walk-on.”

Burkholder has seen playing
time in 12 games this season,
scoring 40 points and averaging
11 to 12 minutes per game.

”Offense is Leanne's strength,”
Bruce commented. ”She has im-
proved a lot since the beginning
of the season. The one thing she
has to work on is her rebounding
andboxing out on defense. Most
of all, she has to work on her
mental game. She has to keep her
concentration.”

By Beth Froelich
Staff Writer

After outstanding dual meet
seasons, the 9-0 Pitt men's swim
team and the 9-3 Pitt women's
swim team are preparing for the
competitive Big East Champion-
ships at Trees Pool, which begin
today and will conclude on
Saturday.

The Big East Championship is
the first meet both teams are rest-
ing and tapering for. Tapering for
a meet makes all the difference in
achieving season best times,
which will hopefully qualify the
swimmers for the NCAA Cham-

’pionships.
Both Pitt's men's and w_omen’s

Champions again this year. The
men's team has won Big East
Championship titles all four years
they've been in the conference,
as have their counterparts — the
Lady Panthers.

The only team that appears to
have the depth or the talent to
challenge the Pitt men's team is
Villanova. Pitt defeated Villano-
va in dual meet action this sea-
son 131-84.

Villanova’s Chris Craft, Blaze
Matthews and Lou Dearstein will
provide a challenge for the Pan-
thers in individual freestyle
events.

”Vi||anova posesses some
amazing talent,” said Pittmen’s
coach Fred Lewis. ”They lack
depth, though. I think the depth

of our team and talent of our in-
dividuals will win it for us again
this year.” _

Pitt beat Villanova in the Big
East Championships last year by
a score of 769 to 662. Coach
Lewis stressed that in order to win
the Big East Championships this
year, it will require that a cham-
pionship effort be put forth by all
16 Pitt swimmers and 4 divers.
Anything less will simply be a los-
ing effort.

The only thing that may hold
the Panthers back is their health.
This past week three swimmers
were reported as having strep
throat.

Junior Jim Emore, one of the
swimmers who had strep-throat,
feels that it won't hold him back
in_ the championship meet this
weekend.

’’I’m feeling better every day,”
said Emore. ”Physically, I think
I'll be ready. Being out of the
water allweek is the only thing
I can see that may slow me up a
bit.

’’I think. our team can win the
Big East Championship again this
year, as long as we pull together
and swim the way we have swum
all season.” .

The‘Panthers will be counting
on Emore to do well in the
400-yard medley relay, the
100-yard butterfly and the
100-yard backstroke. '

ter his fourth first-place win at the
Big East Championships in the
400-yard individual medley,
while Tom Shaulinski will be
aiming for wins in the 500-, 200-
and 100-yard freestyles.

Meanwhile, the Lady Panthers
will more than likely dominate
the Big East again this year. Last
season they won with a record
setting 1,015 points. Second
place Boston College only tallied
535 points.

Pitt gymnast Steve Powanda is
off to a good start this season, and
a lot of that success is due to the
fact he started at such a very
young age. I

”I got interested in gymnastics
when I was 7 years old, but I
didn't get serious until I was in
eighth grade,” said Powanda, a
junior who is majoring in infor-
mation science. Powanda then

made a wise choice — joining a i

real gym school, Gymkhana, in
Shadyside. At Gymkhana,
Powanda was tutored by Elliot
Sanft on the finer points of gym-
nastics. ”Sanft spent a lot of time
with me,” said Powanda. .

'Obviously, the five years
Powanda spent at Gymkhana
paid off. His junior and senior
years he went to the WPIAL
Championships. Powanda also

she was a freshman at South Park

High School, her interest in the‘

sport began waning and she seri-
ously contemplated quitting.

' ”I really didn't want to swim
anymore. I was [really] sick of it,”
said Albright.

Albright’s parents encouraged
her to continue and, with their

support, she persevered and end-

ed up lettering in swimming that
year. The following year, Bob
Kane took over the program, and
he helped inspire Albright to ex-
cel as a swimmer.

”Coach Kane gave me a new
outlook on swimming,” she said.

talent to be a good gymnast. ”My
junior year —‘ that was a real eye—_
opener for me — because I had
never really competed in a real
gymnastics meet before,” said
Powanda. ”I got a chance to see
what guys my age were doing. So
then, in my senior year, I brought
myscores up and qualified for

state.”

. Powanda, a walk-on, chose Pitt
for several reasons. ”EIliot Sanft
is friends with [Pitt men's] Coach
[Frank] D’Amico and told him
about me. I was already familiar
with Pitt's gymnastics program

~ because in high school I went to

a lot of their meets, and I knew
the team was good. Plus it was
close to home.” _
Powanda said he owes a lot of
his success to Sanft. ”I really ap-

ship inthe 100—yard backstroke
herjunior year. In her senior year,
she earned All-America honors as
she helped lead South Park to a
first-place finish.

When it came time to decide
where to go to college, Albright
narrowed her choice to Pitt and
Penn State. In the end, she chose
Pitt. '

”I really liked the girls on the
team and the fact that there was
so much team unity,” Albright
said. _

It has taken time for Albright to
get used to competing at the col-
lege level, but her winning atti-
tude tells you everything you

need to know about how she's

‘ progressing. - ‘

”The competition for myself is
a lot harder here,” she explained.
”There’s a lot of competition
within Pitt's team just to see how
we line up in meets, and I've
faced some tough swimmers
from other schools.”

So far, however, she has more
than held her own. Albright said
she is about six one-hundredths
of a second away from qualifying
for the NCAA championship in
the I00—yard backstroke. She also
swims on Pitt's 200- and
400-yard medley relay teams.

Pitt women's swim coach
David Belowich cites two major
reasons why Albright is a partic-

  glad shedidn’tquit

 

ularly strong backstroker. The first
has to do with A|bright’s keen
ability to sense where her body
is positioned in the water. Sec-
ondly, Belowich said Albright, is
tall and has long arms, _and-that
aids her considerably. I '
As sheitrains for her Big East
Championship debut, she says,
”I’m really excited. It's a big
meet, and I want to do well.”
Belowich believes Albright has
what it takes to succeed. ”Sandy
has learned a tremendous
amount about her swimming this
year,” he said. ”But she's still
raw. She still has so much un-
tapped potential. I believe that
she will continue to get better
and better as the years go by._”

meets. _If it wasn't for. him, I
would have never gotten this far.
I could, [never thank. him
enough,” said Powanda.

Just like any gymnast, Powan-
da has a favorite event —_ the floor
excercise. "I like it because it's
the first event I ever learned, and
I always picked it up easily,” said
Powanda. ”Your routine takes
time, and you can really show the
judge everything you've been

, working on.”

Although the floor is his
favorite event, Powanda thinks
the vault is the easiest, and the
parallel bars is the most difficult.
”If you miss one trick in your rou-
tine, your whole routine starts to
crash. Everything inner-relates to
each other so much on that

event,” Powanda said of the.

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, Februory S13, 1937

By Vince Carey
Staff Writer ‘

There is a new star emerging
on‘ the already strong Pitt
wrestling team. His name is Mike
Tongel, and he competes at 167.

”Mike.has anchored the upper

 weights,” said Pitt head coach

Rande Stottlemyer. ”He has

worked hard and has done real-

ly well.”

Tongel, a junior, grew up in‘

North Hills and started wrestling
the summer after third grade.
”The school had a recreational
program for the summer,” said
Tongel./’A couple of my friends
were going out for it, and I
thought that it would be fun.”
Although it was something that
he wanted to do, Tongel did run
into some opposition. ”My par-
ents didn’t want me to wrestle.

.The reason was that I had broke

my arm earlier in the year, and
the doctor thought that it might
stop growing. I went ahead any-
way, and everything has turned
out all right. A

After watching their son grow
into a top collegiate wrestler,
Tongel’s parents aren't so op-
posed. ”Now my parents are into
it,” said Tongel. ”They go to
almost every match. One time
they even took me to Iowa for the
nationals [championships].”

In high school Tongel took the
state championship in freestyle
wrestling and placed second in
Greco—Roman wrestling. After
this success, he decided to wres-
tle for Pitt. _

”One of the main reasons that
I came to Pitt was that-the team
is emphasized over the individu-
al,” said Tongel. ”Everybody gets
along well, and we are close-knit.
The reason for this is that_every-

body is on -the same training
schedule. We also pull for each
other in the matches.” '

Tongel doesn't see one partic-
ular person as an influence on his
style. ”I think that I have little bits
and parts of "a lot of different
styles. There are some things that
I can do that others can't. On the
other hand, there are things that
others can do, and I can't.

”When I first came here, I
watched Jeffjelic work and tried
to do the things that he did,” said
Tongel. ”But some of the things
that he did didn't work for me, so
I changed. Now I have my own
distinctive style.”

During practice the coaches
will run the wrestlers through a
succession of moves to get them
toned up, then they will tell them
to do their favorite move. The
versatile Tongel reports a small
problem at this. ’’I don't have one

favorite move. I can get on a
streak were something starts
working, and I'll stick with it.
Then I’ll decide to change. I like
to mix it up a bit,” said Tongel.

Tongel, an economics major,
has an impressive 23-I4-I record
on the season. He attributed that
to a loose attitude going into his
matches.

”This year, I feel more relaxed.
I used to go into the match tensed
up. Going out not to lose instead
of to win,” Tongel said. ”Now I
just go out and wrestle as hard as
I can. I don't worry about the
score, [I] just let it fall as it may.”

Stottlemyer sees even more
potential. ”He is a tough kid. His
confidence has improved, and he

has had an incredible year beg

cause of it. I just see him getting
better.

”Around the EWL [Eastern
Wrestling League] they only see

Tongel developing into superstar wrestler

 

Mike Tongel

him as a darkhorse for making the
NCAA tournament. I know what

he is capable of, and [I] see him I

as a shoe—in.”

Tongel and the rest of the Pan-
ther team will travel to Clarion
University on Saturday to try to
improve their 10-3 record.

As Tim Manes got set for his leg
in the mile relay at a recent
University of Pittsburgh track
meet, he reached down, grabbed
his ankle and then put his hand
around his shoe — holding on as
if he were gripping something
precious.

He was.

Inside that shoe, taped to the
bottom of his foot, is a quarter.

The quarter is a constant for
Manes. Where he goes, it goes.
It was given to him by two very
special people.

”There are two people in Mer
cer who have sort ofadopted
me,” Manes explained. ”The two
boys in the families gave me the
quarter for good luck after an in-
jury. I have it in my shoe for ev-
ery race. It is close to me at all
times.”

Manes, who is originally from

Greenville, Pa., also spends time »

in Orlando, Fla., where his
mother lives. When he is there,
he spends his time working at
Walt Disney World.

...while Moore's charms lie in
his tremendous athletic ability  

By Sam Tallarico
Staff Writer I

When a person enters his sec-
ond year of collegiate athletics,
there is usually talk of a ”sopho-
more jinx.” If this holds true,
don't tell Dave Moore about it.

Moore has shown flashes of
brillance this season with the Pitt

two-mile relay team by helping‘

them to qualify for the NCAA
Championship next month.

”Dave has lots of potential, yet
with time and experience, he will
be better,” said men's track
coach John Vasvary. ”Once he
got in the program with the estab-
lished two-mile relay guys, he has
improved.”

Moore, an information science
major, had an outstanding fresh-
man season last year. Not only
was he All-Big East and All-
Eastern, but an All—American in
the two-mile relay indoor and the
100 meters outdoor.

As a member of the two-mile
relay team last year, Moore,
along with Bob Weiner, Joe
Daniels and Tim Manes, holds

 

    
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
    

  THE P|'IT NEws, Wednesday, February I8, 1987 I

Manes’ lucky coin keeps him on
the go for the relay team...
E66

A lot of people say a
live a fantasy life. I’m
an athlete during the
school year and work
for a mouse in the
summer.

— Tim Manes

”A lot of people say I live a fan-
tasy |ife,” Manes joked. ”I’m an
athlete during the school year
and work for a mouse in the
summer.” .

The fantasyvhas even gone one
step farther for Manes. Last year
he accomplished something that
only the elite achieve — some-
thing the rest of the athletic world
keeps dreaming about — he be-
came an All-American.

”It didn't hit me for quite a

‘ while,” Manes admitted, ”but

when it did, I was thrilled.”
Now Manes is working toward
becoming a two-time All-

the Pitt indoor record at 7:21.42.

‘He was equally impressive at
Overbrook High School in
Philadelphia. Moore won the
league championship in the mile,
set the record in_the 800—meter
run in the public league and won
the 1,000-yard run at the Dela-
ware indoor meet.

His abilities were not the only
thing that attracted Moore to Pitt's
program.

”I like the city life. It's what I
was brought up in,” said Moore.
”Pitt is a nice school. I like it, the
people, the surroundings.”

This season, Moore is vastly
improving, and he hopes to con-
tinue his progress. He is one con-
fident individual.

”Overall, I feel I am more men-

Teamwork will help runners win Big East

As the basketball team has cu r-
rently taken on the new identity

V of the ”Beast of the East,” the Pitt
'men’s track team is ready to be

identified as the top runners of
the Big East.

This wild bunch’ of student-
athlethes, better known as Track
Phi, will be competing in the Big
East Indoor Track Championships
this weekend. The Big East meet
will be held in Syracuse, N.Y., at
the Carrier Dome.

”This is the most important
team meet for us,” said Pitt track
coach John Vasvary. The men's
team has been preparing for the
meet since last September, and
the upperclassmen remember
how finishing fourth in team
standings last year left a thorn in
everyone’s side. ’

In the past years, there were ex-
cuses for the team's performances
due to lack of experience or lack
of team depth. But this year's
team has all the components it

CALVIN
HOLMES

takes to win the Big East. This
team is comprised of leadership,
talented athletes in each event
and, most importantly; confi-
dence in their coaching staff and
themselves.

Georgetown and Villanova are
Pitt's strongest opponents in the

meet, while St. John's is also a
contender for the team title.

The Panthers have always gone
into the meet as one of the top
teams but have failed to bring
home the championship.

The Big East meetwill not be
won on the outstanding efforts of
Lee McRae or the nationally-
ranked two-mile relay team. This
Big East Championship is a team
meet and will be won on points

scored by less—acclaimed runners I

on the squad.

As a member of the Pitt track
team, I believe that the emphasis
on ’’I,’’ which has hindered the
team in previous Big East Cham-
pionships, is no longer there. It is
now a team concept. From an in-
side perspective, I believe that if
we go into the meet with brother-
hood in our minds and determi-
nation in our hearts, after_ the last
lap of the meet has been run, the
Pitt Panthers will come home as
the 1987 Big East Track
Champions.

Heisman winner Testaverde still receiving awards

PHILADELPHIA -— Miami
quarterback Vinny Testaverde
has mastered another game — the

  

 

art of answering questions
without putting his foot in his
mouth.

He handles reporters like he
does a growling linebacker, keep-
ing out of trouble.

From New York to Dallas. From

Testaverde arrived in Philadel— _

the New York Giants, honored as
the NFL Player of the Year.

He tried not to act bored atia
news conference where the ques-
tions and the cold cuts were the
same.

/_ Has he talked with the Tampa
Bay Bucs, who are expected to
select him as first pick in the April
NFL draft?

”I met with [new coach] Ray
Perkins a couple_ of times. They
were very brief meetings. There
is nothing I can tell. you really of
importance.”

Did Tampa assure him he was
their choice?

’’l have no, idea.”

Oh yes, ‘he talked with Tampa
quarterback Steve Young, whom
he would challenge for the job
with the Bucs. Young told him‘a
lot of people were leaving, a lot
of new people coming in. The or-'
ganization hopes to turn around
its worst-record image and de-
velop a winning program.

With allithe traveling, who is
doing his studying at Miami?

”I’ve taken the semester off. It_,, -
wasn't fair to ‘my professors or me-

to try and attend all these func-

tions and study. I want my‘

degree, and I'll go back sometime
soon.”  ,

Testaverde said he isn't worry-
ing about the possibility his first
season will start with a pro foot-
ball strike.

”Whatever the situation will
be, I'll go through it. I'll take it
one day at a time, one step at a
time.”

Has he been able get over Mi-
ami's Fiesta "Bowl loss to Penn
State for the national collegiate
football championship?

”It was a game I'll never forget
the rest of my life,” said Testaver-
de. ”We had a great season. But
people only remember that we
lost.”

From a personal standpoint he
has charged his five-interception
Fiesta performance to just one of
those games. '

”Joe Namath has. had five pass-
es intercepted [inione game]. It
was not one ‘of my best games."

No, he.has_n’t looked at the"
game films, not by design, but.

rather lack of time.

Does he have some reaction to '

the off—field image the Miami
team created at the Fiesta Bowl,
one that prompted the university
president to publically
apologize?

”We were marked before we

went to Phoenix. The day after
the game was announced it was
-promoted as good vs. bad.”
He expects to make an impact
as a pro quarterback in two to
three years. ”The only guy I ever
saw do it the first year was Dan
Marino. I'll try my best. That's all

THE PITI NEVI/lS,'Wednesday, February 18, I987

* C-airy Richard optimistic about upcoming season.

  Panther cornerback Gary Richard
looking forwardto fall season   

By Teresa Varley
For The Pitt News

The talk around the University
of Pittsburgh football program is
upbeat ri.ght now. A strong
recruiting class has signed on the
dotted line and that, combined
with a strong contingent of play-
ers, could bring the Panthers back
to the , glory days they once
enjoyed. ' -

The players have confidence,
and one who is excited about the
1987 season is Gary,_Richard, a
junior who transferred one year
ago from Bakersfield Junior Col-
lege in Bakersfield, Calif. Richard
stepped. into the starting lineup
for the Panthers last season at cor-
nerback but is looking to take big-

. ger steps thisseason.

”When I look at the schedule
for next season, I don’t think
there are any teams we can't

beat,” commented Richard. ”We‘

have a lot of experience and,

looking at the experience on the 9
other teams, we have an”.-edge. V.

Realistically, there isn't a game
on the schedule that we shouldn't

win. I think we can go un-l

defeated.”

Richard, originally from Den-
ver, Colo., came on. strong for the
Panthers, especially toward the
end of the season. He received
second team All-East honors from
The Associated Press and was
selected by The Sporting News as
a player a notch below All-

American. This season, as well as

working to improve the team, he
will be working on improving his
own play.

”I would like to make first team
All-East, but a lot of that depends
on how the team does,.” said
Richard. ”Everything needs to
just fall into place. The coaches
are expecting a lot from me this
season, and I am expecting a lot
from myself.”

One aspect of his game that
Richard would like to improve is
his stamina. He will have plenty
of time to work on that when
winter conditioning begins.

”In the second halves of games
I would start to get tired,” said
"Richard. ’’I need to improve on
that, and‘ I think I can do it
through conditioning.”

He is currently working out
four\days a week in the weight
room, working on his upper body
"strength. He will, however, have
to take it easy the first few.weeks
of conditioning, as he is coming
back. from .a groin injury’ sus-
tained during the season.

”I have some workouts that the
trainers and strength coach have
set up for me,” he said. ’’I will be
working with their program until
I am ready to come back.”

For Richard, the 1986 season. I

and the 5-5-1 record had its highs
and lows, but the highs did out-
weigh the lows.

”Playing at Notre Dame was
definitely the high point for me,”
Richard said with a smile. ”I’ve
‘always wanted to play at their

stadium, and going there and
beating them was just great/’...

There were a lot of adjustments ~

Richard had ‘to make coming
from a junior college, but he was
able to handle them without
many hitches.

”Last season was a learning ‘-
one for me,”Richard said. ”But—
it was notlike being a freshman. _ -

I did_n’t have to make as many. ad-
justments because I played a lot
of good junior college players.”

One thing that was a bit hard.-_
for Richard to‘ get usedto was ‘-

playing on artificial turf at -Pitt

Stadium. He was used to natural .

grass and found that he played
better on it. i ' _
”The games that we played
away were all on grass,” Richard
commented, ”and those were my
best games.” 

Football aside, a really hard'ad'—  
justment for Richard to make was 9 ; _
living in the East. He was used to. ‘

California, especially the lifestyle,’

and, ..most importantly,-. V ._the_

weather.

”It’s quite an "adjustment," said -

Richard, who, in; shorts and a‘
sweatshirt, ‘looked "

California than in Pittsburgh.
”You don't get many sunny days

here in Pittsburgh in the winter.”- _
Maybe not flow, but if

Richard's assessment ofthe 1987
season is true, there will be
plenty of sunshine in Pittsburgh‘
when January rolls around next
year. '
