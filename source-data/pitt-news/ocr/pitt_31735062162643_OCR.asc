The university traffic situation
was discussed. It was pointed out
that there was a possibility that
parking tickets could be paid here
at Pitt, rather than the students
having to go to a magistrate in
Wilkinsburg. Although no action
has been taken, this type of plan
might be worked out with the

pa Salzman Hot, K ritz
  Cold in Symphony

V By JOHN LowEN“rHAL
Ah, what a charming evening! Karl Kritz was so cute I
could have just reached out and chucked him under the chin.
But maybe that would have disturbed his artistic sensibilities.

Anyway, it was Symphonetta time again last Thursday.
The “Dictionary of Great Musical Masterworks” deﬁnes “sym-

 

- music:

.

Boccherini and
borscht.”

The net result was -some good
entertainment, geared,’ in the
words of the erstwhile program,
“to the musical needs of the uni-
versity community.” Thursday
evening the university community
needed Beethoven’s “Coriolanus
Overture.” This stormy work was
done wtih great storm.

The next need was satisﬁed
with a. rather decent perform-
a’~nce of a piece by Henry Pur-
cell that is not heard ‘too often,
the “Suite from Dramatic
Music.” The Suite is composed
of music written for the theatre
and is made up of the various
forms prevalent. in the" late
Baroque: Rondeau, Air, Minuet,
Allegro. ' .

Purcell is truly an unheralded

master; the renaissance of his
music has been for too long
awaited. '

The ﬁrst of the two “pieces de'

resistance” was the great “Jupiter
Symphony” of Kritzart -,—— oops -—
Mozart. The Jupiter is an amazing
work from the standpoint of -pure
in the ﬁnale Mozart sets
the world’s record for the most
melodic lines playing at once
without jarring the listener from‘
his seat. ' ‘ L
Thework. hardy ﬂower that...
it is, survived a frosty reading,
mainly .through stellar work
_done by the woodwinds. I’m
‘certain the orchestra could have
done better, but it could‘ not
take oﬁ and leave poor ‘Mr.
Kritz in the icy lu ch. But the
performance was fa ' better than
amateur, to be sure.
Theo Salzman was in ﬁne "form
Thursday night, and when he is

in fine form he is a great ’ce1list.~

He carried the charming Boccher—
ini “Concerto” with lush burstsof
sound and real understandingof
the music, and the technique to
execute his ideas.

After the, “Praeludium” by
Jarnefelt, the men did a stirring
medley from “My Fair Lady.”

Program Se: For

niversary of the gré'at German

For qualiﬁed bachelors, masters, doctors,
career opportunities are greater today at
Du Pont than ever before. There is an in-
teresting Du Pont future for metallurgists,
physicists, mathematicians, electrical and
‘mechanical engineers, and other technical
* specialists, as wellas for chemists and chem-
ical engineers. '

That depends, for the most part, on its
ﬁnish. The most dazzling cars on the road
today wear gleaming coats of DuPont
“Luc’ite”* acrylic lacquer. For “Lucite”
stays bright and beautiful three times longer
than the best conventional ﬁnishes.

Like hundreds of other products de-
. veloped through Du ;Pont research, “Lucite”
has created all kindsof new} jobs. Jobs in
the laboratory. Jobs in production. And ‘
jobs in‘ sales and marketing. Cood jobs
that have contributed substantially to the
growth of DuPont and the prosperity of
our country. .

You probably won’t discover a “Lucite,”
nylon or neoprene,,or'develop a revolu-
tionary new process, your ﬁrst year. No-
body expects you to. But you will be given
responsibility from the very start, along
with training that is personalized to ﬁt your 

interests and special abilities. Our advance-
ment policies are based on the conviction
that you should work at or near the top of
your ability. For as you grow, so do we.‘

It’s an old story. But it’s truer today
than ever. For the very nature of our busi-
ness makes research pay off, giving us the
courage to “obsolete” products when better
ones are found. This is probably why our
sales have increased more than tenfold dur-
ing the last twenty-five years. And for every
dollar we have spent on research during
these years, we have been, able to invest

‘ three in new production facilities. _

What does all this have to do with you?‘

career opportunities at Du Pont, ask your

Resembling a sandlot football team with their different
color pants, the Syracuse Orange played like the “pros” and

Panther eleven be completely outplayed by the bigger and

faster Syracuse team,
The game ended on a worthy
note when Quarterback Dave

Kraus, deep in Orange territory

for the ﬁrst time all day, threw a
intended for Steve Jastrz-
embski which was intercepted by
Dan Rackiewicz who ran (or was
it stumbled) l0l yards to pay
dirt. ‘

The Blue and Gold offensive
attack was held to a minus six
.'a'ards rushing and 80-yards gain-
ed passing. Their typical off-
tackle plays were of no value
against the famed “Sizeable Sev-
en.”

When they decided to go
around end their fate was even
worse as the Orange secondary
moved up quickly to smear them
for losses. When the Panthers
did manage to get a ball carrier
lose with a couple of blockers in
front of him. someone would
miss a block and the play
would be stopped.

In contrast to the Panthers’
drab 'offense the Orange were
brilliant in executing their sup-
erior attack.-Pitchouts and laterals
were common as the ball handling
of the Syracuse quarterbacks
completely fooled the Cats and
most of the spectators.

Art Baker and Ernie Davis liv-

ed up to their reputations as they'
_tore up the Panther line. If they

weren't going for the big yardage

A
V

then they were hitting off tackle
to pick up five or six yards.

’ John Sakal, third string quar-
terback, got his ﬁrst chance to
gide the Panthers’. impotent of-
fense and did little better than
his predecessor, Ivan Toncic.
K r a u‘ s, defensive specialist,
moved the team better than
Toncic or Sakal.

Miehelosen stated after the
game, “They have a real good
football team. They just outplay-
ed us." When asked if he planned
any changes in the offensive per-
sonnel, he said, “We are going
with our best.” .

Baker, who spent most of the
day romping through the Panther
line, said, “Pitt has a good foot-

ball team. They were really up
for this game but so were our
guys. The score doesn't indicate

what kind of a game it was,” he
concluded.

If the Panthers have a real
good football team what does
that make Syracuse?

Sakal who is supposed to be a
good passer looked better on de-
fense making -some hard tackles.
Dick Maytus, a sophomore,_ who
has missed most of the season be-
cause of injuries, looked good on
Saturday. Norton Seaman may
have suffered a torn knee cart-
ilege and could be out for the re-

mainder of the year.

Kick in Last 35 Seconds Wins

Cat Booters Gain Fifth
Nose By Brockport, 2-1

By JACK SMITH

Don Jerich and Simon Pestich each hit for one goal as
the Panther Soccer eleven edged Brockport State University,
2-1, Saturday at Ellsworth Field.

Play was even until, with 35 seconds left in the third
quarter, Jerich took a penalty kick and slammed it into
the upper right hand ‘corner of the net for the Cats ﬁrst score.

Then with seven minutes gone ’

in the fourth quarter Tom Young
centered the ball to Ed Weih-
rauch who passed to Simon Pes-
tich. Pestich, coming in from the
left side, hit on a shot from about
eight yards out ‘for the winning
goal.

. Wilhelm Scores
Brockport’s only goal came with

less ‘than two minutes remaining.

Frank Wilhelm, the. boy who scor-
ed theonly goal in last year’s 1-0
victory over the Panthers, hit for
Brockport.

Brockport outshot the Blue
and Gold’ 21-12. “They took
most of their shots‘ from about
35 yards out,” commented Coach
Leo Bemis. “I’m not saying that
they were not good shots, but
our defense was good and
George, Zanicopoulos played an
outstanding game as goalie.”

Most of Brockport’s shots were
taken from far out because of the
slippery condition in, front of the
goals. They °hoped that the shots
might .skip on the mud, but Zani-
copoulus covered well on each
play.

Strategy VVorks

“We played a wing game as we V

expected to do,” Bemis said. “.We
worked the ball more than they
did so we didn’t get as many
shots. But" our strategy worked a
little better.”

_ Pestich had most of the Pan-

ther’s shots but could only ﬁnd
the range once. Ed Giraldo
played halfback and, along with
Pestich, Zanicopoulos and Mur-
doch were sighted as standouts.

“lt’s hard to point to any one
boy in that game,” Bemis stated.
“It was a well played game and
.a real teameitort.”

Ron Prado, first string halfback,
was sick and didn’t play. _Bob
Murdoch, outside right, was mov-
ed into his position. The win "put
the Cats at 5-2 for the season.

yFrosh Capture
F irst, 46-I6

Bimbo Cecconi’s overdue fresh-
man gridders ﬁnally displayed the
power that the pre-season ratings
showed them to have. Touted as
the best looking bunch of fresh-
men to enter Pitt they dropped
their first two games before up-
ending Kent State, 46-16, Friday
night at the losers ﬁeld.

The Panthers combined a-tight
defense with a powerful scoring
attack to gain their ﬁrst victory
of the season. Kent was held to
three ﬁrst downs, two of them
by penalties, and were able to
score on two long passes.

Trailing, 14-16, at halftime the
Blue and Gold scored 32 points
in the ﬁnal two periods to over-
come Kents lead. Long, Kuzneski,
Ronca, Beisser, Pinto, Billy Tra-
ﬁgani all scored for the Cats.
