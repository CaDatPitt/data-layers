 (See Editom'al—“A Proposal with

Inherent Values”—Page Four)

A Pass-Fail Option for
juniors and seniors in the
School -of Liberal Arts
(SLA) will go into effect in
the Fall Trimester, accord-
ing to James A. Kehl, dean
of the SLA. Upperclassmen will
be able to take two courses (max.
of -one per term) which do not
satisfy any requirements other
than credits toward the 124 need-
ed for graduation.

The announcement, came Mon-
day after a meeting of the Exe-
cutive Council of the SLA. The
initial proposalhad been made
by the Liberal Arts Cabinet on
November 3, 1966, and the ﬁnal
draft, which will appear in next
year’s SLA Bulletin, was changed
only slightly. (The initial pro-
posal, submitted by chairman
Tom Sacks, had suggested that
the pass-fail option be open to
sophomores, juniors, and seniors.)

Under the Pass-Fail Option,
students with more than 64 cred-
its and who are in good academic
standing must designate the
course to be taken on the Pass-
Fail Option at the time of reg-
istration and this can not be
changed unless the student wish-
es to drop the course completely.

Instructors will not know which
students have elected their

LA Continues
To Offer Grad

Courses to Srs.

The School of Liberal Arts is
continuing its policy of permit-
tin g graduate courses to be taken-
by undergraduates and has set
forth several conditions to clari-
fy matters.

To qualify for registration, the,
undergraduate must be_a senior"
(at least 94 credits) with,a mini-‘
mum cumulative QPA of 3.0. En-
rollment will depend upon writ-
ten approval of the undergrad-
uat_e’s major‘advisor and the in-
structor in the" course in which,
plans to enroll.’ There will be a
limit of _one course per term,‘
-with a maximum of two graduate
courses counting toward the bag-
calaureate degree. Agiven course
“may ‘not.'coun_t toward both the
V 'der’gr’aduat,e'  graduate de-

Becomes Effective This Fall 

courses on a Pass-Fail basis and
will report a quality grade in the
usual manner to the Office of
Student Records. At that time, if
the grade is D or above, it will
be recorded as a P. On the other
hand, if the student failed the
course, the grade F will be re-
corded.

The limited Pass-Fail Option
adopted here is similar to sys-
tems which have been ado-pted
around the country. Ivy League
schools, for example, Columbia,
Princeton, and Brown have insti-
tuted Pass-Fail Options. Other
large universities with this sys-
tem include California Institute
of Technology, Stanford, and the
University of California at Berke- ‘
ley.

Dean Kehl emphasized that this
system will give students an op-
portunity to take courses which
they would otherwise been afraid
to take because it might hurt
their QPA’s. For example, a his-
tory major might ordinarily shud-
der with the thought of taking a
calculus course in the Mathema-
tics Departm‘ent, because he
would proba-b_1y get a D or at

best C, which would not help his '
QPA. With the new system he.:.;~_ 1:
will be able to take such a course _ .
and receive a. P which will not. T A
be considered in his QPA. _
Dean Kehl noted that schools
which have adopted this system
have not had students ﬂocking to
courses because of the Pass-Fail
system. He explained that the
bright students want their A or
B to help their QPA, while the
students near probation need
more quality points to keep them
out of danger. 
Dean Kehl emphasized that the a
Liberal Arts Cabinet initiated and. ..
helped develop the proposal. Tom
Sacks, liberal arts chairman, com-
merited, “We feel that. the accep- .
tance of the proposal is a sign-
that students can present con- ,  ._jZ7f
structive programs to the faculty ’ A A
and administrators and have _ -1;
them fairly pudged and respect.-' ‘
ed.” 
Sacks also explained, “The Cab-  -
inet shouldn’t act as a sounding _,_.
board for ideas emanating from is . C
the Dean’s Office, but is also cap-' a '
able of formulating ideas of their
own.” I

Must Have Goals

by BERNI McLEOD

. Never before have _jobs
\ "been growing so rapidly and

salaries so high. If you know

what you want, if you're
capable, t-here’s a good
chance for success. However.

Dr. Walter Ritenour, director ‘of

the University Placement Service,

says to beware of waiting until

Commencement to think about a

career. No goals may mean no

good jobs.

_ “As usual this year,” said Dr.
, Ritenour,
mands for engineering, math, and
science majors not only because
science is so valued today, but
because these people are ‘trained

’ for deﬁnite areas of work.”

 Humanities and social science

students may ﬁnd job hunting

more difficult,” said Dr. Ritenour,

“but a history major, for exam-

ple, who now wants to do aspe-

ciﬁc job in business, and knows
why he wants to do it, is very

I - likely to be chosen by a company.

   
  

  
 

“we have great de-_

A ob Offers Increase

If this same student even has a
minor which represents a busi-
ness skill, such as math, chemis-
try of statistics, he is also quite
employable.”

The University Placement Serv-
ice, which according to their
yearly report, ﬁnds jobs for more
than three out of ﬁve students
on their register, ﬁnds many of
these people absorbed by the

same companies or large em-

players.

“The federal and state govern-
ments,” noted Dr. Ritenour needs
many of our people, as do large
department and retail stores, and
now recently, the banks. Banks
have changed their image great-
ly in the past years from pro-

viding low-paying “genteel pov-_

erty in a cage” to offering top-
quality management jobs. This is
du.e to their great growth be-
cause of consumer lending, plus
the increase in branch banking.
Each of these branches, for ex-
ample, needs a manager.”

 

for Srs.

According to Dr. Ritenour “it’s
still a man’s world when it comes
to business.” Women are harder
to place. in jobs, he feels because
many go after “dream jobs” un-

‘less they enter the traditional

nursing or teaching ﬁelds.
“Women often mention person-
nel and public relations jobs,”
said Dr. Ritenour, “and are real-
ly not sure what such work en-
tails.” He feels that a little self

education about these ﬁelds and
the speciﬁc jobs to seek, would
increase a person’s job possibil-
ities. '

“The greatest service we might
give some of these students,” said
Dr. Ritenour, “is some realistic
job counseling early in their col-
lege careers. This service would
be invaluable to those people
who don’t know about the many
jobs available, or maybe even
their own abilities. "Once they
ﬁnd this out, the Placement Serv-
ice would be much more able to
help them.”

The recently adopted pass-fail option will always stand as an af-
firmation of an ideal that students can affect positive change at the Uni-
versity. It is an example of a rational proposal which was proposed by a
student group and then was eventually adopted by the administration.
«The idea for a pass-fail option was initially proposed by the Liberal
Arts Cabinet to Liberal Arts Dean James Kehl last term. The only
change from‘ the Cabinet’s original proposal is that sophomores will not

have to go before Judicial Board. v

Editor, The Pitt News:

Pittsburgh’s, attempt to devel-
op a resident professional reper-

tory theatre seems to have been»

judged prematurely with the re-
cent decision by the Playhouse
Board of Directors not to extend
the contract of Artistic Director
John Hancock. What will this

mean for the future of a viable «

progressive theatre in Pittsburgh?
Hancock’s dismissal comes at a
time when our experimental the-
atre is undergoing a critical test.
The original estimate of the time
required for a transition from a
community theatre to a solid
professional theatre was three
years; yet, by any calculation,

We would hope that because the plan originated with students, the
faculty would respect this innovation all the more. But already We have
heard grumbling from faculty members concerning the pass-fail princi-
ple. One professor said that he taught a course in the 180’s series that
he was sure would be full of pass-fail students. (professors are- not per-
_ mitted to know whether‘ students are taking their course under the new
 option). He was basing his judgment on the idea that -because his
V - course would count for distribution, many students might be taking it

who would not want to be graded on their work. He said he would not
have interest in the course because he knew that most of the members
‘ of the class would be merely taking the course for credit.

°th Inh r nt Val es

To begin with, faculty should realize that simply because a student
has elected to take a course on a pass-fail basis this does not mean that
he has little interest in learning. In most cases the student is taking the
‘course on this basis simply because he feels unsure of his background
in the area. The faculty member has an added responsibility to inspire

such students because the pass-fail course will often be their first ven-
ture into the ‘subject matter.

 

We can n-ot comprehend the rationale of those who say that the

less than a year and a half has
elapsed in the experiment. Han-
cock himself has had less than
ﬁve and a half months and even
that time was severely disrupted
by ﬁnancial and management
problems. ~

The primary reason offered for
the’ non-renewal of Hancock's
contract has been declining box
office receipts. We wonder if this
is not to be expected during a
transition of this kind to which
the Playhouse nominally commit-
ed itself. Progressive changes

take time—time to develop fresh

ideas in the Playhouse program

, and time to develop a new audi-

ence. The original _estimate was
three years; could it be that this
premature action represents sec-
ond thoughts on the part of some
of the Board members concern-

ing the wisdom of expanding the
ideas and ' clientel of the Play-

house?

Now is the time that decisions
about Pittsburgh’s theatrical po-
licy are being made. It is essen-
tial that the Playhouse directors
be aware of the “newand grow-
ing audience” which is willing to
support a progressive theatre. If
you are a member of this “new”
audience and are concerned that
progressive theatre continue in
Pittsburgh, you should write Dr.
Bernard Yadoﬁ’, 5521 Bartlett St.,
Pittsburgh, Pa. 15217, stating
your opinion.

Student Questions

“With-It” Activities
Editor, The Pitt News:

In Wednesday's edition of The
Pitt News there appeared an edi-
torial on the recent “Panty Raid.”
Editorials are usually an exercise
in constructive criticism—quite
readily -this was not the case. Of
all the reasons to criticize a “Pan-
ty Raid,” I ﬁnd it remarkable

\ that the one chosen found its
‘\way into print.

I feel that the entire action

was meant merely as an exer-

' cisev in good-natured fun. Since

fun is never out ‘of date, then the
branding of fun as passe is—too
say the least-—unwise.

The tone of the editorial was

one of sheer idiocy. We can all

throw names as well as the next
person. Should those names b.ave
absolutely no need to be thrown
—as was the case-—we can only
conclude they were being thrown
for the sake of having something
—anything to say. Again, this is
not the purpose of an editorial:

LITTLE MAN ON CAMPUS‘

new option will ill effect the educational system. The School of Liberal
Arts has severely limited the number of courses students can take un-
der this plan (a maximum of six credits is permitted and thus it would
be doubtful that any one course would have a large number of pass-fail
students in it. The possibility of this small minority being in a class is
just cause f-or the negative View taken by some faculty members.

We can only reaffirm our belief that the benefits of the recently
passed option far out way any disadvantages. If both students and fac-
ulty enter the project with the idea that the new plan will broaden the
{scope of {education than it can be of immense value to the School of
Liberal Arts.

to the Editor

Pettiness should be beyond an
editorial department.

Finally, the “withit” activities
(with the possible exception of
rather strong advice concerning
the Office of Finance) smack of
conformity: Don’t think — just
do what everybody else is doing,
Needless to say,‘ this isn’t the best
thing to advocate editorially.

University “Fun Department” 3

by HOBART HARRIS

The Input-Output room,
or 10 room is situated on the
seventh floor of the Cathe-
dral. Basically, its job is to
take punch card decks from
students using the Univers-
ity's computers and get them

down to the computer operators,

It could be dull, but it isn’t, if
you believe Joan Hazlick, one of
the girls who works there. “This
is the fun dep_artment of the Uni-
versity,” she said, “you meet the
greatest people here.”

Joan and her ﬁriends who work
there are the people who make
the difference. They rotate work-
ing behind the desk and doing
keypunching and all like their
jobs. While discussing their work,
the girls always talk about their
own relationships, “We’re all
good friends,” said Karen. “Yeah,”
agreed Maggie Reading, “we like
each other a lot. We’re always
fooling around. Every Monday
night we go up to the Luna and
have a great time.” “We collect

pennies up there,” Karen added
cryptically.

“But we have a lot fun while
we’re here too,” said Karen.
“There are hundreds of things to
do. We’re never bored. During
August, when there isn’t too
much work to do, We’re all mak-
ing afghans and rugs together.”
Joan contributed, “And We al-
ways have a party here on Fri-
days. We have cake and candy
and sit around and have a good
time.”

“We also have a neat radio,”
Maggie remarked. “It is played
loud, and anyone who walks into
the room is treated to it. But we
also want a coke machine and
a candy machine and a cigarette
machine too,” she added. “'We
need them all.!”

do I. 0. Girls E Like Their Work

The girls don't always have it
so easy, however—there is always
one nemesis plagueing them.
“Did you ever see anybody drop
a deck?” Joan asked. “The cards
go ﬂying all over the ﬂoor and
everything is a mess.” It has only
happened a ,few times, but when
it does we all have to scramble

around picking up all those cards. .

It’s such a horrible mess.”

They have another problem too, i

but one that they have less con-
trol over. As Karen put it, “We
have to give back programs to
all the people who bring them
in. When they run, they love us,
but when something has’ gone
wrong, we're always the ones
they blame. And when the com-
puter is broken, nobody can un-
derstand why their -programs

coach Bob Timmons as much as Temples

16-7 ballclub.

“We’ve played enough games there in the past
to become acclimated to the crowd,” he said. “Be-
sides, the Temple fans usually don’t pick on out-
of-town teams.”  ~‘

Since the cagers bring a 5-16 mark into the
contest, there’s not much to pick on. The Owls

ins and John Baum averaging 17 points apiece,
and’ Chris Kefalos and Joe Cromer chipping in
14 and 11, respectively. 

“They’re a quick ball club with good ball hand-
dlers,” Timmons observed. “Baum is just a sopho-
more, only 6-5, and he's their big rebounder with
about 11 a game.’’‘ . _

Temple won its ﬁrst eight in a row before los-
ing to Oklahoma City over Christmas. Since then
coach Harry Litwack has been disappointed with
their play. The Owls have lost to Fordham, and
St. John’s beat them at the buzzer, 65-63.

Both New York teams have wins over the
cagers as well. The Redmen didn’t need the ﬁnal
buzzer, however. They won handily, 95-66.

Whether the Panthers can penetrate Litwack’s
standard 1-2-2 zone will determine how close they
will come to Temple. “We’ll try to work the ball
into the high post,” explained Timmons. “That’s
probably the best way to beat their zone.”

He also indicated that the cagers’ backcourt,
particularly Stan Falenski, would do most of the
shooting. “Falenski will start for Ken Kalata,” he
added. “He’s earned his job back.” A

As for Kalata, Timmons plans to use him with
Al.DiFrischia as his ﬁrst two substitutes. “Lenny’s
in a slump, ﬁghting himself,” he said. “VVith

Butterflier Norris Expects
Mermen to Become Power

by JAY KAPLAN
The recent history of the swimming team is like the
roller coaster at Coney Island. With sophomore butterflier
Howie Norris? help, things may straighten out.

"‘ When he and his twin brother Richard werefreshmen,
the varsity sported a 4-7 record. However, things looked
brighter for this season. An 8-1 mark seemed within grasp,

but when the mermen lost a double meet to Ohio U. and Kent State
and spoiled things.

But even when «the year turned sour, the consistent perform-
ances of Howie stood out. This high school All—American swimmer,
except for his ﬁrst meet, is undefeated in the 200-yard butterﬂy
event. Presently, he owns a streak of eight ﬁrst place ﬁnishes.

Norris looks at this year’s inconsistent record as a “great im-
provement over last year.” He feels that “the record was a little
better than last year, but the spirit was much greater.” He ‘gives a
lot of credit to cozvch Jerry Snyder. “Snyder got rid of the apathy
on the team simply because of his gung-ho nature."

On the the subject of the newly hired coach, Bill Grant from
Mt. Lebanon High School, Norris is reluctant to speak. “I don’t know
enough about him; when he comes to Pitt, I’ll judge him on how he
works us.”

Howie feels that the key to the future is recruiting. “We’re go-
ing to work really hard recruiting,” he promised. “Let’s face it, we
want a good team.’’ According to Norris, Pitt’s selling point should
be the facilities at/Trees Pool. “I’ve been swimming ever since I
was nine, and I've yet to ﬁnd anything like Trees Pool. There just
isn’t anything to compare with .i .” _ .-

‘ With the 'team’s recruiting program being given the green light,
Howie feels that Pitt will become an Eastern’ power in f‘a few years.”

Against the Fordham Rams, he

the season’s high point total with

It took him 14 games to become

son expectations. I “I averaged
about 18 points before the season
began and I was really looking
forward to a good season,” Bol-
lens said.

“Never before had- I gotten er-

Actually coach Bob Timmons
could be credited for Bollens’
hot hand in the last seven games.
Timmons reverted from the slow-
down devices used against the
likes of West Virginia, St. John's,
and Penn State to a speeded-up
offense. '

“We don’t have anything to
lose now,” Bollens said. “I hated
that slow down against bigger

teams because you had to be real
careful with passes and shots.

“I like to shoot, sometimes I’m
hot, and the guys say ‘feed Bol-
lens.’ Inhigh school, I used to
be the big gun,” Bollens said.

He admires the moves of Carl
