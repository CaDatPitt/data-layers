.VOLUME EIGHTY-ONE, ISSUE EIGHTY-@iNfE: g

By John Enright

Editor-in-Chief

Pitt basketball star Charles
Smith, who has been deliber-
ating since early March
whether to enter June's Na-
tional Basketball Association
draft, said at a press confer-
ence at Pitt Stadium yesterday
that he will stay with the Pan-
thers for his final year of col-
legiate eligibility‘.

The 6-10 center, who told
the Pittsburgh Press almost
three weeks ago that he was
”8O percent sure” he would
enter the draft, surprised the
media by ann‘ouncing he will

With his mother, Dorothy

— who both flew in from Bridg-
eport, Conn., for the press
conference, seated next to
him, Smith went to the podi-
um and reminisced about his
three years at Pitt, implying
that he would indeed declare
himself eligible for the draft as
many had expected.

Said Smith, — ”I’ve. played
here for three years, and my
decision, as you know, is a
tough one. To this moment, I

New provost looking forward to transition

By Frances Sansig
News Editor

» Whether or not to accept a
high-ranking position like provost

‘of a major university can be a

difficult decision for any educa-
tional administrator to make.

Last ‘summer, for example,
Roger Benjamin faced just such
a decision, and confusion result-
ed when he first said he would re-
main at Pitt —— and shortly
thereafter accepted a position at
the University of Minnesota.

However, Rudolph Weingart-. .

ner, who assumes the position of
provost this summer, said ”it was

_ kind of a natural thing to do.”

Weingartner said he has more
than a routine awareness of Pitt
because he has been a member
of the board of visitors for Pitt's
Faculty of Arts and Sciences for

- four years. But, he said, making

the transition from Dean of the
College of Arts and Sciences at
Northwestern University in
Chicago to Provost of the Univer-

sity of Pittsburgh will still require
some adjustment. -

”I’m a dean now  that makes
a lot of difference [from being a

provost]. I'll have to learn to work '

in a differentway. In this case-,

one works with ‘deans, with
center heads. [This is good] if you i

like amore abstract position. It's
going to be very interesting to
work in a different way.”

A man of action, Weingartner

was instrumental in the develop- ‘

ment of several programs at
Northwestern and said he will
continue with the same en-
thusiasm at Pitt. ‘

”Occassional|y I write papers
on an issue to get people think-
ing and acting,” he said. "I'm cer-
tainly very' interested ' in
undergraduate education. And I
think it's exceedingly important
for Pittto do the best it can.”

As provost, Weingartner will
work‘ closely with University

President Wesley Posvar. This

year's Pittsburgher" of the Year,
Posvar is perhaps the most charis-

matic figure associated with the
University. Weingartner said he
prefers totake a slightly different

‘ stance.

’’I don't mind being visible, but
I don't particularly like to ad-
minister by public speeches,” he
said. ”But nobody’s ever-called
me a shrinking violet.”

~Weingartner, whose specialty
is philosophy, said the fact that
Pitt has an excellent philosophy

department is a plus, but didn't '

have anything to do with his ac-
cepting the position.

”I’m delighted to be a member
of a [school with a] good
philosophy department,” he said.
’’I was an [philosophy] undergrad
in the late 40s. I was a philosophy
professor long before I did this.”

Though Weingartner said he is
intensely interested in under-
graduate education, he said he is
relatively ignorant on the subject

-of student aid. However, he said
i he is very much against Reagan's

cuts in the education budget.
.’.’I think this country is going to
face an education crisis in the

mid-90s,’’ he said. He anticipates
a shortage of young faculty as the
majority begin to age and retire.

”I think it's unwise for this
country not to maintain its educa-
tional system.” said-Weingartner.

Moving to the cityof Pittsburgh
is something Weingartner said he
and his wife are looking forward
to. ”Everyone I've met seems to
be a member of the chamber of
commerce. It has affected my
wife and me. We're both city
people by temperament.

» ”What seems to be one of the
big differences — access in Pitts-

burgh is easier. We're looking

forward to checking things out. I
just got the program to the Pitts-
burgh Symphony and I expect to
subscribe. I'm looking forward to

making the transition complete/"

said ‘Weingartner. ' *~

Weingartner has a 13-year
track record at Northwestern and

' sa-id he will -stay -at’Pitt ”for as.

long as it makes sense to Pitt and
myself.” _

Secretary

campaigns
for release
of brother

By Frances Sansig
News Editor

The plight of Christina Conga-
ware andher family has a haunt-
ing sound of familiarity — her
brother is being held captive in
an overseas country for no appar-
ent reason.

Gongaware, asecretary in the

steno pool for the University of . 7

Pittsburgh, is the sister ofjoe Lon-
go, who is being held prisoner in
Communist Angola. .Longo’s only
brother, Vincent, is an under-
graduate at Pitt.

Two‘ weeks ago yesterday,

'Gongaware’s brother was taken

prisoner and is now being held in

‘ Liwanda, the capitol of. Angola.

Longo, 33, is a ferry pilot — he

has delivered planes to all parts .
of the world. Ferry pilots carry no _ g
cargo; they simply deliver planes

to buyers and.then take a com-
mercial flight home. There are
only about 50 ferry pilots in the
world, according to Gongaware.‘

This was'Longo’s first overseas-. , g
flight after a four-year absence '

from ferrying — he worked as a
private Lear jet pilot for a car
dealership in Greensburg, Pa.,
during that absence. '

Gongaware confirmed a report .

in the Greensburg Tribune-

Review that Longo was en route.
to Botswana to deliver a Beech-
craft Bonanza light plane to the .
National Airways Corporation -3

he was apparently flying too near

Angolan airspace and was forced 

to land. - 4
According to Gongaware, the
family hasn't a clue as to why

, Longo is being held prisoner.

.”We’re just surmising how he

. got over Angola. Perhaps he was.

just near it. Maybe it was ‘ a
problem with the plane or [a lack-
of] fuel, and he was looking for

a place to land. He's an exc_ellent"

pilot,” said Gongaware.

He is accredited with ’’an un-» I . __
. real” amount of flying time said * '

Gongaware. He received his pi-

lot's license one Week before he .

received his driver's license.

There is, according to _Gonga.-  
ware, no case of mistaken iden- I 
tity in‘ this incident. ”The-State 4:: 
Department has contacted my _’ 
father and has confirmed its is, J 
Joey. We do know it is him,’-’ she" Vfl

said.

lrangate hearings open; Secord on the stand

WASHINGTON — Former
Maj. Gen. Richard Secord, the
first witness in the Iran-Contra
hearings, testified Tuesday that
approximately $3.5 million in Ira-
nian arms sales proceeds were
diverted to aid the Contra rebels
and said he believed the Reagan
administration ”knew of my con-

’ duct and approved it.”

Secord, breaking months of si-
Ience, said in a nationally tele-
vised hearing that Iran’ paid $30
million for American-made-
weapons. About $2 million re-
mains unaccounted for, he said
under questioning.

The retired general, testifying
without a grant of immunity
sought by other witnesses, said
he and other private individuals
he recruited for the effort ”be-
lieved very much in the sig-
nificance of what we were doing
and that our conduct was in fur-
therance of the president's
policies.

’’I also understood that this ad-
ministration _knew of my conduct
and approved it,” he said.

Secord has been identified by
congressional investigators as
playing a key role in both the
secret sale of weapons to Iran —
which President Reagan autho-
rized — and the diversion of part
of the arms sale proceeds to the

Contras — which the president

said he was unaware of.

Scarfo case now in
the hands of a jury

PHILADELPHIA —— Nicodemo
”LittIe Nicky” Scarfo is ”a dan-
gerous man who rules his dead-
ly army with an iron fist,” the
prosecuting attorney said Tues-
day in closing the government's
$1 million extortion-conspiracy
case against the reputed mob
boss.

The defense contends the two
chief prosecution witnesses, both
admitted murderers who said
they were inducted into the Ma-
fia by Scarfo, were liars ”trying to
save their skins from the death
‘penalty by implicating Mr.
Scarfo.”

Price of stamps to
rise to 25 cents in '88

WASHINGTON —The cost of _
,mailing a letterwill jump to a

quarter sometime next year, and
most other postage rates also will
rise under a new rate structure
proposed Tuesday by the U.S.
Postal Service. '

The Postal Service Board of
Governors voted 5-1 for the new
rates, an increase that will aver-
age 16 percent over all classes of
mail. ’

Board Chairman John N.
Griesemer estimated‘ the addi-

tional cost of postage to the aver-

As part of the new plan, prices
for the overnight mail services
would drop somewhat, while
rates for advertising bulk mail

would also fluctuate.

A balanced education for

the kind of education the new
curriculum was designed to

”We want to provide our

”Community Day”
celebrates Pitt's 200th

By Rae Ann Collette
Staff Writer

Despite the rain on Sunday, the
University of Pittsburgh held yet
another bicentennial celebration
— Community Day.

The event featured food, ex-
hibits and performances which
were free and open to the public.

”This is our way of thanking '

the community for its support,
not just in this, our bicentennial
year,.but for the continuing sup-
port this region has shown Pitt for
over 200 years,” university presi-
dent Wesley Posvar said.

Some of the May 3 events in-
cluded tours of the Cathedral of
Learning’s Nationality Rooms, ex-
hibits and presentations of 18th
century culture in the Cathedral's
Commons Room, a brass band

performance in Carnegie Music

Hall and a Sacred Music Festival
in Heinz Chapel.

A special salute to the

,Cathedral builders was held in ._

the Commons Room. ’f|t’s Our
University” was the slogan when
then-Chancellor John Bowman
asked the children of Pittsburgh
area schoolsto buy a brick for a

. dime to help build the Cathedral
“ of Learning. In» .1925, 97,000.

school children'"donat'ed and
received a certificate. A

Pitt invited these Cathedral
builders, now in their 70s, to the
bicentennial celebration to again
accept another certificate of
recognition, to sign the special bi-
centennial ledger and to pose for
a group photo. ‘

A 1925 dime donor, Marie
Harris Hughes of Penn Hills, said
she felt proud to give a dime to
help with the construction of the
Cathedral. She recalled thinking
as a child,”Hey, I own part of that
[the Cathedral].’’

Hughes, now 75, donated the
dime while attending Beltz-
hoover School which was locat-
ed in the South Hills.

‘'1 have a real Pitt family; we're
a part of Pitt,” Hughes said. She
said her two daughters, two sons-
in—law, a grandson and a grand-
daughter have all graduated from
the University of Pittsburgh.

Everyone who attended the
celebration had the opportunity
to sign the ”Happy Birthday, Pitt”

ledger in the Commons‘Room. ‘

The historic ledger will be
preserved in the archives and will
be a part of the first exhibition of
the university's tricentennial in
2087.

Pitt has been celebratingits bi-
centennial throughout this aca-
demic year and will conclude the
festivities at commencement on
Sunday, May 10. A ‘

Why bother with

a smoking policy?

Hillman Library is the centerpiece of ”The Campus of the
Future.” The new carpet and the electronic wizardry provide
a glimpse ofwhat the future holds for Pitt — nice, clean modern

I convenience.

The library also grants a preview of another aspect of what
could be — a no-smoking policy.

In last week's Pitt News, we carried an ad on page 12. It was
a poll to help develop a university-widesmoking policy spon-
sored by the Office of Affirmative Action.

Smoking offends some people. And so it is their right to study.

tand-works in 9a i"s‘rr‘1oke'-free‘ atmosphere.-—At.the-same«-time~,ethere
are 'rna<nys‘sm"okers who‘ also 'have’the right «to=-indulge i-n their

habit while they study or work. What's to be done?

If the universityhas to have a smoking policy, the rights and
wishes of all of the members of the community must be taken
into consideration. A total ban such as the one in Hillman
Library is wrong. At the same time, the lack of a smoking poli-

. cy is equally wrong. One tramples the civil rights of smokers,

and the other does the same to the rights of non-smokers.

If the university feels it needs a smoking policy, an all-out I

ban is a bad idea. The original policy of the ”Campus of the
Past” was the most sane. Just provide smokers with smoking

' . lounges and the problem's solved.

inhumanity takes
on a new meaning.

In the wake of the killing of American engineer Benjamin

Linder by Contra forces recently in Nicaragua, -the world is left I

to wonder about the motivations of both sides in the civil war.
There are those who claim that the volunteers working in

-I the Nicaraguan villages are merely pawns for the Sandinista
V government, while others assert that they are but altruists provid-

ing much-needed services to the impoverished people in the

country‘. i
A It is easy to envision the political delight on both sides of

» the conﬂict as the news that Linder had been killed was released.

‘For all, there would be a renewed shot at publicity, and there

would be a chance for everyone involved to benefit from the

V media coverage.

If the volunteers can be accused of anything, it is shortsight-
edness. They willingly go to the mostviolent and least deve-
loped nations in the world to provide what help they can for
the people of those nations. They do not, -for the most part,
have political ties to the people they are trying to help, only
human ones.

. Before we allow ourselves to use Linder’s death toreinforce
whatever opinions we may have about the situation in
Nicaragua, it seems prudent to rememeber that he was work-
ing to help the poor in that country, which, incidentially, is
the professed aim of his murderers. .

Linder did not die for any cause, nor did he intend to make
a political statement by his death. The most unfortunate aspect
of the incident is not that he died at the hands of the Contras,

_ for it is their vocation to kill, but that he left so muchiundone
d- for the people of Nicaragua. I — ‘ o » - ‘

A (non)sense of fashion

Ah, the feel of warm spring
breezes is no longer the stuff of
daydreams.’ Warm weather, with
all its trappings of life, good will,
fun and warm rains, has fallen on
us, and I don't think I could be
happier. '

There is something, though,
that has me worried. It's about
my wardrobe.

a See, I really don't have much

of a_..wardrobe, and that's the

whole problem.

I look in the newspapers and
see ads for spring clothes, for new
bathing suits, for health spas. Ob-
viously, we all want to look our
best and, by the implication of
the ads, be our best, for the com-
ing season.

As anyone not living in a
locked cave for the last thousand

years or so knows, you have to
be in fashion if you ever want to
get anywhere. You have to dress
for success, you have to look
good.

Really, it's the most important
thing a person has going for him.
First impressions and all that. ’

But, the thing that scares me is
that I haven't updated my
wardrobe, and so, it seems to my
limited opinion, I don't have a
chance for success.

So, I'm going to do what any
normal, spineless, impressiona-
ble person in’ modern America
would do. I'm going to go get the

Socialism doesn't

Dr. Robert Glew recently [Apr.
6] delivered a lecture before his
colleagues and students of the Pitt
medical school entitled ”The
Demise of Medicine in Ameri-
ca.” To give those who didn't at-
tend the lecture an idea of its
basic ﬂavor, and paraphrasing as
accurately as I can, Dr. Glew
spoke of such things as the
”shameful fact that millions of
Americans are either uninsured
or underinsured," the ”shamefuI,
new entrepreneurial spirit per-
vading the medical profession”
(best exemplified by his favorite

A target, the medical school's clin-
. ical practice plans) ‘and a so-
‘ called ”failure of capitalism.” he

denounced greed and egoism
and praised community spirit and
altruism. In short, he gave a
speech worthy of Marx or Lenin.

Many of the things he said
were deserving of approval, but
one statement, which illustrated
his basic philosophical premise,
deserves condemnation. He at-
tempted to equate the ”Jefferso-
nian right to the pursuit of
happiness” with a so-called
”right to receive free medical
care.” Being free to pursue one’s
own legitimate goals is one thing,

«but receiving the unearned

benefits of someone else’s labor
is something quite different.

the rights ofthe doctors and/or
taxpayers whom he would force
(through government power) to
deliver and/or pay for that free
medical care. He Ieftout of his
equation their right to life, which

’ means their right to the benefits

of their own labor, by which they.
create their means of survival.
Whether the dictator be Dr. Glew
or an amorphous, majority-ruled

-state,'this position is definitely not

Jeffersonian and, at least-for the
first century of our nation's ex-
istance, ' was considered ‘un-
American. [...]

Dr. Glew, in his earnest desire
to provide the best possible med-
ical care to all people, regardless
of their ability to pay, would

rather make slaves of doctors _

and/or taxpayers. But slavery, in
any form, in any amount and for
any reason, is immoral. In es-
sence then, Dr. Glew advocates
slavery, and his basic philosophi-
cal position is evil.

The slow but accelerating
death, which the American med-
ical profession is now experienc-
ing is not due to any failure of
capitalism, but to government in-
tervention which began 22 years

. ago with.Med.i¢ateand Medkeidi _

I've seen and the people I've
spoken with, that if I were to go
to the store armed with the latest
issue of GO and a fat checkbook,
I could buy success.

I could at least buy the illusion
of success, which, as any good,
unthinking fashion slave will tell
you, is almost as important.

to. learn that in any attempt to
change that situation, we lose

m\Apathy’s as bad as crime

Most of us restrain from mur—
der, burglary, assault and extor-
tion. We brake for red lights, fire
engines and little old ladies. Yet,
what does it mean to be a true
”|aw—abiding citizen”?

Three weeks ago, I realized I
could not be classified as one.

It was a Thursday night, around

I '\.I2:30 a.m., when I decided to

take my fourth break from study-
ing for finals to get another
cheeseburger and cup of coffee.
I left the Cathedral and headed

torward Burger King by way of,

Fifth Avenue. As I passed Litch-
field Towers, I heard someone
shout from a Tower C window,
”Are you stealing that car?”

I looked across the street to see
four men in their early 205 break-
ing in to an old, beat-up, red
Chevrolet parked on the curb.
Two of the men entered the car
from the back seat as the other
two men stood next to the car,
watching passing pedestrians.
Again I heard the shout from
Tower,C, ”Hey, are you stealing
that car?!"

One of the car thieves turned
toward the tower, smiled and re-
plied with a laugh, ”Why, is it
yours?”

The voice from the tower was
silenced, and the" thieves piled

into the car. I chuckled, shook my I

head and entered Burger King.
When I came out with my food,’
the car was gone.

On my way back to the
Cathedral, I asked myself a few

Social . segregation

As a black ‘ student at the
University of Pittsburgh, l’d like
to say that Pitt is a socially
segregated school. [Pitt has its
share of minorities, but how often
does anyone actually see blacks
and whites joining in social ac-
tivities together?

Who's to blame for this racial
separation? The white students,
the black students, the adminis-
trators or the history of student re-
lations at Pitt? Pitt is
predominantly white, and both
black and white students know it.

‘This segregation" is primarily
self-inflicted upon the students at
Pitt. We simply choose not to

»’’pal around” with‘ members of

”the other” race.

When students come to col-
lege, many of them are instantly
drawn to social activities. So they
ask themselves questions:
”Where can I hang out on
weekends?” ”Is it going to be my
type of crowd?” "What type of
people are socially accepted?"

In most instances, many of
these students are drawn to frater-
nities and sororities — Greek life.

Greek organizations are
diverse, and they attract all types

of people. Some have images ,

they try to uphold; others don't."
It is ultimately up to the student
to decide which organization
they want to be a part of —— if they
want to be Creek at all. Even if
students decide to remain in-
dependent, it is the Greek organi-
zations that set the standard of
college life. _ I

questions as I stuffed my face
with french fries. Why didn't I try
to stop the thieves? Why didn't
anyone else? Where the hell
were the police?

I admit, for people to risk their
lives to defend a stranger's car is
an unlikely possibility. However,
none of the several witnesses of
the theft, including myself, even
tried to contact the police. It
wasn't as if the police were so far
away either. They usually can be
found congregating in the ”war
zone” on the corner of Forbes
and Bouquet.

The car thieves of Oakland
don't seem to care where the
police hang out. They're so con-
fident in judging the lack of
police observation and the pub-
lic’s sense of duty, that they can
comfortably shout out their
crimes in case anyone is curious
enough to ask.

Since I became a member of a
black sorority, I feel this segrega-
tion more than ever. I feel that all
of the Greeks at Pitt should try to
be role models for the student
population, especially for incom-
ing freshmen. ’

The Greeks at Pitt should try to
symbolize the well-rounded, elite
student. Of course, there are
many other, well-rounded stu-
dents who choose-not to be
Greek, but the ones who do ob-

. viously want to make it publical-

ly known.

f So why do these Greek organi-
zations decide to separate them-
selves by race? I honestly cannot,
and will not, try to answer this
question for the 30 white Greek
organizations at Pitt and the four
black Greek organizations, but I
can say that it may be hard for a

white person to feel comfortable -

with and support the ideals of a
black organization.

Delta Sigma Theta’s main pur-
pose is to help improve the qual-
ity of life for minorities. We don't
limit ourselves to blacks only, but
we focus on the underprivileged.
Whether we're helping a poor
black person with his studies,
helping a woman (white or black)
raise money to start her own bus-
iness or helping any student ob-
tain financial aid —- we are
concerned with minorities. We

are a public service sorority and

. - I - . : . . .

-o-1-z-....:--‘.....:

If we can't always count on the
police and the public, then who
else can we turn to but ourselves?
The law of ”survival of the fittest”
includes even our civilized
species.

Presently, we have a self-

I defense oriented society. Most

households pack a gun. Children
as young as five years of age are
learning karate. Mace, brass
knuckles and switch blades are
always in demand. People will
put up with crime as long as it
doesn't confront them personally.

Society's lack of unity is not
limited to car theft. Years back, a
woman by the name of Kitty
Genovese was murdered in New
York in front of several witness-
es. The witnesses watched Kitty
being stabbed repeatedly from
their apartment windows. It was
hours before someone called the
police.

Minding our own business and

concentrating on ourselves is.

how we survive. Perhaps helping
a stranger threatens our concen-
tration. On Thursday night, I suc-
cumbed to this intimidation.

However, at least one altruistic
voice was heard that -night from
a true ”law-abiding citizen.” I'm
sure there are many voices like
the one I heard from Tower C.
Hopefully, it won't be long until
the voices come out of the rooms
and onto the streets.

provide our services in minority
communities.

The members of Delta Sigma
Theta have an understanding and
can relate to people of our race
and the problems faced by
minorities. We know what it is
like to be competing for a job, or
any position, where the organiza-
tion does not want any blacks, or
for that matter, has to fill their
quota. We know what it's like to
be stereotyped as ignorant.

Some professors also assume
this and don't want. to be
bothered with a black student un-
less he/she practicallybreaks the
professor's door down just to

show the professor his/her deter-

mination.

We also know that there are a
|ot'of underprivileged black chil-
dren who were brought up in bad

home environments, which can

contribute to low self-esteem.
Many of these children have the
potential to be successful in life;
so if we‘ (as the black
”privileged”) don't give them a
helping hand, chances are that
they will never realize their full
potential. We feel comfortable
and self—satisfied helping out and
dealing with people of our race.

The fact of the matter is that
we, the Pitt Greeks, separate our-
selves from each other. I doubt
anyone has all of the answers, but
we_ should make a collective ef-
fort to support each other and at-
tend one another’s functions —
it's a start!

High—tech doesn't
mean a better life

Sometimes it seems as if
high technology is out there
raging beyond the control
of any of us, as if high tech-
nology and high technolo-
gy alone is going to
determine how we live the
rest of our lives — whether
we want to live it that way
or not.

Consider a product deve-
loped by a Carson, Ca.

of those hi gh—tech electron-

ics firms that seem to be  
popping up every week or .

so. TTC has invented a telephone that you don't have to dial
or touch — all you have to do is talk to it.

According to TTC, you simply say the name of the person
or company you want to call. The phone —- which has been
programmed to recognize certain voices and phrases — "hears”
you and automatically dials the number.

The example that TTC’s marketing executives like to use con- ’

cerns a homeowner who is kneeling by the kitchen sink trying
to deal with a burst pipe. Instead of standing up and running
to the phone — while water spurts all over the kitchen — the
homeowner needs only to call out, ”Get me the plumber!”

At this point, the phone automatically calls the plumber. The
homeowner can then talk to the plumber from across the room
— without ever touching the phone.

When I heard about this, I was struck by one thing: It didn't
even hit me as being that weird. It just seemed like another high-
tech ”advance” that we would be living with soon. I called the
president of TTC — his name is Tony.Clowes —-and I asked
him how the thing worked.

“Don't think of all of the technology involved,” he said. ”Just
think in terms of never having to touch your telephone again.”

I asked if that were literally going to be true.

”Absolute|y,” he said. ”All you have to do is call out, ‘Get
me Suzuki in Tokyo,’ and your telephone will get you Suzuki
in Tokyo.”

Clowes said that the voice-activated telephone is capable of
understanding four different peoples’ voices and that it. is capa-

~ ble of remembering up to '80 phone ‘numbers for each .vo_ice..  ..

”So the businessman will program the phone with the 80

numbers he calls most often,” Clowes said. ”If he wants other >. , ‘ «

people to be able to use his phone, he programs it to recog-
nize their voices, too. From that point on he just commands
the phone to make the calls.”

He said the phone can do other tricks, too.

”I have some trouble memorizing things like my wedding
anniversary or my wife's shoe size,” he said. .”The telephone
has a display screen. All that I have to do is call out ’wedding
anniversary,’ and it will display my wedding anniversary. Or
I can call out, ’wife’s shoe size,’ and it will display my wife's
shoe size.” '

I asked him how_.he would dial a number that wasn't one
of the 80 his phone was programmed to remember. Would he
actually have to touch the phone then? '

”No,” he said. ’’I told you —'— you never _have to touch the I

phone again. If I want the phone to dial a specific number, and
the number isn't in the phone's memory, I just say the number,
for example, '5-5-5-3-2-I-4.’ It takes a little longer than simply
saying ‘Get me the plumber,’ but the call gets made."

The more we talked, the more I began to question all of this.

Dialing a phone number these days is awfully simple e all your
. have to do is tap the buttons on the phone. It takes only a few

seconds. Are our lives really going to be improved greatly by

_ letting our phones listen to us and dial themselves?

If_ I had to pick one improvement in our telephones, it

wouldn't be that one. It would be making long-distance calls "

via AT&T as good as they were before the big phone company
breakup. On many calls —_especia||y calls to New York City,

but not limited to calls to New York City — it now seems that, V
an amazingly high percentage of the time you end up getting.

a recording telling you that the circuits are busy and that you .
’ should try again. Either that or a dead line -— nothing happens

at all. Granted, the very idea of long-distance phone calls is kind
of a miracle, but why is it that it used to be simple to get through,
and now — in this supposedly high-tech age — it is no longer
so simple?~| would gladly forgo telephones that dial themselves

for a return to telephone service the way it was before the court I

decision ”improved” it.

That wasn’tTTC’s problem, though — so I_asked Tony'Clowes
if he thought his voice-activated phone would really catch on
or would end up as some forgotten gimmick. i

”This is not a gimmick," he said sternly. ”This is the way that g '

people are going to make their phone calls in the future. Fifty

‘ years from now, when people talk about having to physically

touch their phones to make an outgoing call, it will be just a
dim memory — a piece of trivia."

Prof researches laser technology

By Theresa Costello
Staff Writer

Lasers have been hailed as
instrumental in the treatment
of certain physical ailments —
but laser technology at both
the University of Pittsburgh
and in the Pittsburgh area is
not limited to the practice of
medicine.

Proof of this is the work of
a team headed by Dr. David
Pratt, a Pitt chemistry profes-
sor. Their objective, working
with laser spectra, is one that
may seem abstract to many —
it is the excitation of the elec-
trons of certain molecules.

The molecule that they are
currently working on is ben-
zophenone, which is also

perfumes.

”We are creating an energy-
rich species that can transfer
this energy to other species,”

said Pratt, ”a type of-bunsen- V

burner.”

One of Pratt's goals is to be
able to control the electron —
to direct the path of the
electron.

”I have to figure out how to
excite the molecule in such a
way [that] the energy does not
flow randomly from one place
to another within the
molecule,” said Pratt.

This task is a difficult one be-
cause thé excited ‘ molecule
has 72 different ”vibrational
degrees of freedom” or differ-
ent ways the molecule can

move.

The practical benefits of ‘

these experiments can be ap-
plied in the separation of sub-
stances and also in the use of
computers.

However, another important
benefit is that it stimulates curi-
osity, said Pratt. _

According to Pratt, many in-
ventions, from liquid crystals
in watches to» CAT scans,
came about because of some-
one’s interest in a particular
discipline, which ultimately
led to practical material
benefits as well as increased
general knowledge. .

Pratt's philosophy is one
shared by many scientists-in_
that he hopes ”that something
totally unexcepted happens.

This year's Shakespeare test will have musical flare

Producing director Attilio

They've made it into a

The task of converting this
now not-so-sacred literature

' into * catchy song—and—dance

tunes has been given to
Christine Frezza, the festival's

"There are a certain num-

Favorini said another reason
they chose Cyrano is that it
fits the classical mode of the
festival. And it can't be
produced as thoroughly by
the ‘average dinner theater.

be a much larger production
than the other two plays, and
it will be produced by ac-
claimed Canadian director

Favorini said the festival's
first two productions will try to
change the way some people
think about Shakespeare.

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday May 6, 1937'

The Replacements’ controlled

abandon still from the heart

Pleased to Meet Me
The Replacements
Sire Records

By John Young

The Replacements began their
”hootenanny” album by picking
up each others’ instruments and
ioyously struggling through the
title song's two minutes‘ of
straight ahead, rock 'n’ roll
chord patterns.

Their willingness to play songs
along rock's outer limits and
record albums that feature slop-
py, roaring rave—ups one minute
and acoustic experiments the
next, won the band a loyal
legion of listeners who enjoyed
seeing the group, happily flip off
the rock establishment with their
sponteneity and ecclecticism.

Despite its melodic sophistica-
tion and big, loud sound, Tim,
The Replacements’ maior-label’

debut, disappointed some long-

time fans with its homogeniety.‘

Those folks will probably be
pleased to hear the group's
latest effort P/eased To Meet
Me, The record demonstrates
the band's (and especially Paul
Westerberg's) ever—increasing

maturity, while still maintaining’

their spirit of controlled abandon
and ability to pull off numerous
stylistic forays.

"l.O.U." kicks off -the album
with gritty, ”Let It Be"-
reminiscent fervor, followed by
perhaps the most burning, mov-
ing song on the LP, _”Alex
Chilton." . -

Chilton himself actually ap-

pears to add guitar work to the

horn-punctuated, album—closing
”Can’t Hardly-Wait.” ”Sky—
way," a haunting, spare
Westerberg solo piece, is also
outstanding.

Despite the "loss of their

guitarist Bob Stinson, The.

Replacements have maintained

their raw, fat guitar sound with
Westerberg playing quite ably
on his own. Stinson's brother
Tommy adds great, prominently-
mixed bass work to P/eased To
Meet /\/le's songs, and Chris
lvlars’ drumming is sharp, clean
and always dead—on.

The band's decision to record
in Memphis rather than Min-
neapolis seems to have revital-
ized them; producer Jim
Dickinson creates an echoing,
clear atmosphere for the group
to fill with their surprisingly sub-
tle, textured noise. .

Pleased To Meet l\/le's songs
ring with aching clarity and an
overwhelming sense of longing
and realism, a testament to the
powerful writing of Paul Wester-
berg and his cohorts and to the
worth of playing one's instru-
ment with more feeling than the-
oretical precision.

The Replacements sound like a

band still playing from the heart. . ~

fit if

 

nished. Life's Rich Pageant was
a slickly produced effort that
tried to capture the energy of the
band's live performances.

Dead Letter Office accom-
plishes that and more.

It's a collection of B-sides and
other oddities, defined by
guitarist Peter Buck on the record
sleeve as ”failed experiments,
badly written songs, drunken
jokes and, occasionally, a
worthwhile song that doesn't fit
the feel of the album.” "

This LP is overtly diverse. Like
Buck said, the songs are all re-
jects that didn't fit in with the feel
of other R.E;M. albums. That's
what makes Dead Letter Office
so listenable.

lt's a collection of raunchy,
sloppily produced, half-awake,
unshaven, down and dirty
drunken tunes.

How refreshing.

”Walter's Theme/King of the
Road" is theneatest track on the
album. Buck describes it as be-
ing recorded "at the very end of
a long alcohol-soaked day.” It
starts outwith a jumpy tune that

- slows down and transforms into

Roger Miller's classic rock/coun-
try ”King of the Road."

lt's almost too easy to picture
R.E.f\/l. recording the song in a
smoke-filled room reeking with
the stench of southern whiskey.

_Other tunes of raunch on the
album include: ‘

0 ”Rotary Ten" —,va.com-
pletely original instrumental that
sounds like the theme to Peter
Gunn; P

0 ”Pale Blue Eyes" — a slap-
py reproduction of the Lou Reed
song» that's soft, lazy and
southern;

0 ”Bandwagon" -— a really
R.E.M.-ish tune rich with harmo-
nies and Buck's jangly guitar (it's
virtually impossible to write an
R.E.lVl. review without using
some derivitave of the word
jangle);

0 ”Voice of Herald” — this
would have fit into any R.E.-M.
album — don't know why they
never decided to keep it on; i

0 ”Burning Hell” — a consu-_
mately rank tune. It shows how
truly violent and yucky R.E.l\/l.
can be.

0 ”White Tornado" ,— this
bitchin’ surf-jam. puts Carl Wil-
son to shame.

Last, and certainly least":

0 ”Toys in the Attic" -— this
gross rendition of the Aerosmith
tune publicly displays R.E.M.’s
admitted immaturity.

There are a few other songs I
failed to mention, but this album
is a must for any R.E.M. fan,
even if you already have all the
B—sides. It's worth it just for the
liner notes and Buck's comments.

in Dead Letter Office, the boys
from Athens, Ga., have proven
that they can still mumble lyrics
with the bestof them.-

Smith's decision baffled even the experts

Everybody knew that it was
Charles Smith, and Charles Smith
alone, who would make the de-
cision whether to turn in his No.
32 Pitt game jersey for an NBA
uniform.

So where did all these other
Charles Smiths come from?

Ever since the 6-10 center de-
bated the prospects of another
year at Pitt or the prestige of an
NBA career, most people felt a lit-
tle too sure that Smith would
choose the latter fate. It was eerie
how sure of Smith's departure
everyone was.

JOHN
ENRIGHT

And when Smith told The Pitts-
burgh Press on April 18 that he
was ”80 percent sure” he was
leaving, those same mind readers
said, ‘See, I told you.’

But, in a surprising turn of
events, Smith startled everyone
yesterday with his announcement
that he will return for his senior
year. 1

In a teary-eyed speech, Smith
talked of his three previous years
at Pitt, thanked everyone in-
volved in the Panther‘ basketball
program, and said how much he
would miss ’’Rome’’_ and the
boys before throwing the best
curveball by a Pittsburgh athlete
this‘ year, by announcing he
would return for his last season-.

Smith didn't duck the questions
about. his ambivalent feelings
toward his decision. ’’I decided
on Saturday to stay and then i

changed my mind [Tuesday]_

The recent NFL d

By Thomas Danyluk
Staff Writer

Despite the overall lack of ta-

lent in the 1987 NFL draft, there

were plenty_of interesting maneu-
vers and manipulations by teams
to keep fans and analysts buzzing
until the training camps in mid-
July. Some clubs, like the Pitts-
burgh_Steelers, Washington Red-
skins and Detroit.Lions helped
their cause quite considerably,

while others (i.e. St. Louis, Chica-' .

go and Atlanta) caught colds from
this draft and might still be ailing

by the season's start in Sep-*

tember.

Here is an overall. look at —

”Who Landed Whom," ”Why’d
They Take That Fella,” and "Just

What Exactly is Going on Here?”

in this year's college draft.

The Steals — What the heck
was Pitt lineman Randy. Dixon
doing hanging around in the
fourth round? Scouts should all
be well-informed about Pitt's
reputation as a lineman gold-
mine. The Indianapolis Colts
snagged a real nugget in landing
Dixon that late.

Pittsburgh landed a wonderful
defensive back from Baylor
named Thomas Everett. This guy
was the winner of the Jim Thorpe
Award (given. to the nation's top

night and changed it again,” said
Smith, who said he is happy with
his decision, although not sure
it's the correct one.

One has to wonder if Smith
didn't change his mind a few
more times at the podium. His
speech seemed wonderfully set
for a grand farewell from his glory
days at Pitt. But, in the end, Smith
made the decision that most peo-
ple wanted to hear.

You see, while Smith would
have made a lot of money enter-
ing this year’s NBA draft, there
are those who feel he's not ready
for the pros.

Due to the absence of quality
players in this year's draft, Smith
was projected as a top 10 pick,
something he'll definitely be next
year. He is an unusual prodigy —
a 6-10 player who can move like
no other player in the country his
size —— but there are still weak-
nesses in his game. Said Smith, ’’I
need to work on everything.”

Pitt coach Paul Evans had a
feeling Smith would stay all
along. ’’I think he's a very smart
individual, in fact after reading
Bob Smizik’s article on Sunday I
thought it was pretty much a lock
he was going to stay,” said Evans
in reference to the Pittsburgh
Press columnist who wrote that
another year at Pitt wouldn't do

-Smith any good.

Smith knows he is taking a cal-
culated risk, though. The possibil-
ity of injury is always there, but
he said he can't worry about such

- trivial matters. He's getting ready

for next season. ’ .-

defensive back) and a two-time
All-American. Again, Everett also
lasted until the fourth round. Pair
him with first-round choice Ron
Woodson and the Steelers should
have a top-notch defensive back-
field — shadesof the 1981 San
Francisco 49ers, who landed
Ronnie ‘Lott, Carlton Williamson
and Eric Wright in the same draft.
Remember what that assemblage
did for the team?

The Miami Dolphins picked up
Penn State offensive tackle Chris
Conlin in the fifth round. Conlin
was a four-year starter under
coach Joe Paterno — 5 testimony

_ in itself on what kind of player he

must be.

A poor senior season enabled‘

the Dallas Cowboys_ to snare
monster offensive guard Jeff Zim-

merman of Florida. Zimmerman

was a finalist for both the Outland
and Lombardi trophies as well as
a two-time All-SEC performer."
Dallas was able to bolster its
defense in the earlier rounds and
still come up with reinforcement
for its sagging offensive line.

Detroit got a late pick of a pre-
mier nose tackle in SMU’s Jerry
Ball who may be even better than
his predecessor, San Francisco's
Michael Carter..

in exchange for the Chargers’ No.

Browns then acquired a sleeper

Mike Junkin. Junkin i_s considered

Curtis stormed for the Blue Devils-
in the early '70s. But Banks for

Seton Hall slams Panthers out of the park 

By Dave Zafris

Contibruting Editor

For the last couple of weeks,
Pitt's baseball team has survived
on the strength of its hitting.

Then they ran into the Seton
Hall Pirates.

“Seton Hall is the best team in
the Big East Conference South Di-
vision. There is no doubt of that
after the Pirates swept a crucial
three game series from the Pan-
thers last weekend. '

”We got whooped,” said Pitt
coach Bobby Lewis. ”They ate
our lunch. They are a pretty good
ballclub.”

Pretty good is usually reserved
for teams that finish near the top

a of the standings. It's not an ac-

curate description of Seton Hall.
The first—place Pirates sport a 15-2
record after crushing Pitt, 6-0,

13-2 and 18-6.

The Panthers not only have
their backs up against the wall —
they are stuck to it. They must
sweep this weekend's series
against Georgetown and hope
that Villanova is swept also
(which isn't so improbable, since
the Wildcats play Seton Hall this
weekend).

Then Pitt must sweep Villano-
va a week later to take hold of se-
cond place and get into the
division playoffs.

In short, the Panthers must win
their last six games, and the Wild-
cats must lose their last six.

Lewis will never be confused
with the eternal optimist, Chuck
Tanner. He understands the sit-
uation.

”It might be over before we get
to play Villanova. Now we have

to look for help from other_

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday May 6, 1987

teams,” he said.

Pitt started off last weekend like
they didn't need anyone’s help.
Starting pitcher Sean Carrol shut-
down the vaunted Pirate bats,
giving up only five hits in his first
complete game of the season. But
Seton Hall managed six runs, aid-
ed by Dana Brown's sixth inning
home run.

Unfortunately for Pitt, Pirate
pitcher Rick Vichroski was near
perfect. He missed his shot at a
no—hitter when John Brush poked
a single through in the seventh
inning.

Then Seton Hall's bats warmed
up.

The Pirates managed 13 runs
off of 12 hits in the second game,
and 18 runs off of 14 hits in the
third game. In all, five Pitt pitch-
ers threw in the last two games.

First baseman Dave Westwood

had the most productive
weekend for the Panthers, going
four for nine during the last two
games.

”|’ve been struggling the past
two or three games, and I just
said to myself in the second game
’I’m going to hit that ball right up
the middle, rather than try to pull
the ball,” Westwood said.

Westwood finished that game
with two singles up the middle
and two flyouts to centerfield. In
the first inning of the third game,
he hit a two—run homer over the
left field wall.

”I wasn't even trying to hit a
home run, but I got a hold of it,”
Westwood said. ’’I’m my own
worst enemy when I'm trying to
pull the ball and hit a home run.
But I was able to concentrate this
weekend.”

Westwood said Seton Hall is so

tough because they play every-
day, and they have an easier aca-
demic schedule.

”A lot of their guys take exter-
nal studies courses, so they can
take tests on the road. Also, they
have great facilities, and they play
every day. And the only way to
get better is to play all the time.

’’It’s tough for our pitchers to
pitch only once a week. It's also
hard to keep the morale up on
the team when you don't play
everyday,” Westwood said.

Lewis offered other reasons
why Seton Hall has been so suc-
cessful.

”They don't have division I
football, so they have made the
commitment to having a strong
baseball program. It's tough to get
that kind of exposure at Pitt, be-
cause we have such successful

doing the right thing. I hope it
works out for the better. The city
has been real great.

’’I just would like to reflect on
the past a little bit. When I came
here my freshman year, I thought
I was a big part of seeing Pitt
grow. From my freshman year,
seeing a few empty seats in the
stands, to last year when there
were people waiting outside to
get in just to see us play — that's
been a real big part of my de-
cision.

”With this year's recruiting
class, whether I stay or leave, Pitt
will be successful. I really feel this

recruiting class has been the best_:_

Pitt's ever had. Also I'd like to say
a couple things to the team — Jer-
ome [Lane], Demetreus [Gore]
and all the guys that are going to
be around next year. It's real fun
being with them. I have a real
great time with [them]. It's going
to be ‘real hard to leave them.
There's going to be success [at
Pitt] no matter what, so my deci-
sion is that I'm going to pass up
the [NBA] draft and stay at Pitt for
my senior year.”

How's that for a bizarre end-
ing? It had been speculated that
Smith was almost certain to enter
the draft, and over the last two
weeks, two Panther players told

probably be leaving.

Pitt coach Paul Evans said that
he was pleased, and not too sur-
prised, with Smith's decision. ”I
felt fairly confident he would
stay, until I was in Florida over
Easter when I saw a newspaper
saying there was an 80 percent
chance he would go into the
draft. That was when I wasn't
sure,” said Evans. ”But we've got
everything here he wants/’,

Smith, a first team All—Big East
selection this past‘ season, will
return along with three other
starters (Lane, Gore and Mike
Goodson) from last year's 25-8
team that was ranked in the Top
20 all season long. Add to that a
superb recruiting class and the
Panthers will probably be a
preseason consensus Top 5 team
and could contend for a national
championship next season. ]”|

his actions yesterday. It was
classy of Smith,_who is, accord-
ing to Evans, ”-very close to his
mother,” to have her come in
from Bridgeport, Conn. for the
press conference. It also showed
a lot of guts for Smith to decide

The Panthers .recruited two
talented big men for next year —

‘ 6-IO junior college star Marvin

Branch and 6-9 Parade All-
American'Bobby Martin —— who
would have had to replace Smith
at the center position. Now
Branch and Martin only have to
worry about backing up Smith.
”TaIent wise [Smith] wouldn't
have been as hard to replace, but
he's one of the guys who went
through the transition year. He's
our leader. We would have had
to go through another transition
year if he had left,” said Evans,
who has named Smith captain of
next year's squad.

”It was a decision with my
heart and with my mind. My
mind said to go into the draft, but
my heart told me to stay,” said
Smith, who is the sixth—leading
scorer (1,458) and sixth-leading
rebounder (748) in Pitt history.

Many feel that Smith's mother

much of which was brought on
by himself-— that he was leaving.

As Evans said, ’’Charles is a

outstanding individual and I think
if he wasn't an outstanding
basketball player we would want
him to stay here and be in our

cision to stay, but she disagreed.
”I didn't tell him anything to
make him stay. It was his deci-

ded, ”Yes. I'm happy about it.”

Smith said that his mother did
play a part in his decision. ”She’s
been with me the whole time.
She wanted me to stay, but it's
my decision, and she'd go along
with whatever I do,” he said.

’’Charles is really close to his

mother. I know [Smith's] mother ’

really wanted him to stay. She
really wants him to complete his
education, and I think she was a
major force behind his decision,”
said Evans.

to the draft by underclassmen, he
said, ”I’m not going to change
my mind. This is it.”
