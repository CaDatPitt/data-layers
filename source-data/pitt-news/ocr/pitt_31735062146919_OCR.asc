t-hat of the children -seemed espe-
cially typical of boys and girls
who were doing a serious job

with a lot of earnestness and a
touch of fun. The children, who
are students at Lind-en school,
were, on -the stage, real Nor-
wegian children who buried. bricks
of gold and rolled huge snow men
to use as markers.

Snow Treasure sold widely on
its ﬁrst publication by E. P. Dut-
ton and Co; in 1942. In 1943, the
John C. Winston Co. obtained
permission from Miss M-cswigan
and Dutton’s to shorten the book
and publish it as part of a fourth-
grade reader. At p-re-sent, arrange-
ments are being ma-de to print the

dramatization.

Christmas, 1944, ﬁnds America approaching the threshold
of great things to come. We ’ve come a long way since that
ﬁrst post-Pearl Harbor holiday season; careful organization has
replaced hit-or-miss efforts; actual accomplishments have sup-
planted paper prophecies; and dogged bitter retreats have given
way to hold decisive offenses. The miracle of American produc-
tive genius and the shining valor of American ﬁghting men have
blazed gloriously around the globe.

‘Today, at the very peak of the struggle, the words “Peace

I on earth, good will toward men” may seem to ring with mock-

ing emptiness above a world ﬂoundering in a sodden sea of
bloody conﬂict. Yet, this message, this concise essence of the
Christmas spirit symbolizes more than anything else what we
are ﬁghting for and what our men are daily dying for.

On the day of ﬁnal victory, America and her allies will have

‘ before them the greatest opportunity ever oifered man for the

establishment of peace on earth. The whole world is in this War;
therefore, the whole world must have a part in the peace. This
time we want no armed truce. We want a real peace, the kind

All S. that every nation will participate in and every man will see the

need of. ,
Our men are carrying the spirit of Christmas around the

 World; the peace—makers must see that it remains there. We

have given the world examples of many things. One of the
greatest is our three thousand-mile unarmed and unguarded
northern border. Nowhere on this earth can its equivalent be

i found. This example of peace and good will shows that it can

be done; the world’s future survival dictates that it must be

done.

Only by remembering Christmas, not once a year, but every
dayof every year, can the peoples of this earth obtain what they
must have to insure the future continuance of human civilization.-
“Peace on earth, good will toward men”—-those seven words

sum up our war-time aims and

their peace-time fulﬁllment.
James Pettican.

“No more, please,” cried Mr.
Upson Downe, elevator man on
the 75th ﬂoor express, and slid
the heavy door shut along its
groove. Then he closed the cage
door and turned to sit down on
his stool. Wichard, an inwisible
Wabbit 9"2” in his Doctor Den-
tons, was already sitting there,

, leering at the g-irls, his whiskers

tilted at a rakish angle.

“We'd be just lwke a can of
sidines, if we had a wittle owive

in general, looking as though he

hoped they would think he had
invented the remark himself.

‘ Nobody seemed to be paying
any attention. They were all lis-

tening to a boy who was telling a

story about a talking race horse.

“Did you evew heaw the one
about -the two wittle Iholes?”

, Wichard asked’. He paused. “Well,

well,” he exclaimed triumphantly.
Nobody -laughed.

“I guess -that was an old po-

tato,” Wichard apologized. He
turned to Mr. Downe.
_ “Gweetings,” said Wichard, 1i-st-
lessly, “and salutations,” he added,
a little warmth creeping into his
voice.

“Wichard,” said Mr. Downe
ﬁrmly, “Wichard, how many times"
do I have to tell you to stay out

of my elevator? You scare cus-

Wichard yawned. “Isn’t this
thing -a Westinghouse?” he said,
eyeing the brass name plate.

“Yes, it's a Westinghouse,”
replied Mr. Downe peevishly. “So
what?”

“Well, O.K.,” drawled Wichard.
“Well,_O.K. So I'm west-ing!”

Mr. Downe brought the elevator
to a jolting stop at the 45th ﬂoor.
“Look here, you animated D.T.,”
he addvres-sed Wichard coldly.
“This is where you get out. Now
scram, you walking p-sychosis, and
never darken my door again.”

Wichard bowed with mock
courtesy. “How could I?” he
jeered. “You fowget I'm inwisible.

Well, so long, pal. Sweet

Mr. Downe watched Wichard
disappear down the corridor.
Then he shut the door again,
thoughtfully, and started the c-ar.
The same boy was still telling
his story about the race horse.

“Mister,” the horse was say-
ing, “I wasn’t always -a milk-
wagon horse. Why, I once won
the ‘Kentucky Derby!”_~ .

Mr. Upson Downe pushed the
button for floor 18. “These kids,”
he said to himself indulgently.
“Who ever heard of a talking

6th War Loan’.

Ferguson Urges
Bond Purchase

Editor’s note: John Maxwell
Ferguson, associate professor of
economics in the University, was
asked by the editor of The Pitt
News to write an article concern-
ing the Sixth War Loan drive new
in progress throughout the nation.
Below is his appeal to the Pitt
students and faculty for their
wholehearted cooperation in this
great project.

In these days of war -time pros-
perity, roughly one-fourth of
American wage-e-arners are re-
ceiving no more than $26 a week.
This circumstance is one of the

' major reasons why purchases of

Series E War Bonds in rth~e.cur-
ren-t Sixth War Loan campaign
are far below the national quota
of \$2,50:O.,«0‘0l0,1O0»0» in the over-all
goal of $14,~000,0r0I0,O-0'0.‘

The Sixth War Loan drive has
gone over the top, thanks to heavy
buying by banks and corporations.
Yet in a sense the drive has been
a failure by reason of the lag in
-the sale of “E” bonds. Granted
that fat pay envelopes are bu-t a
myth to one-third of America’s
workers it is still true that in

this crucial war year, the public.

is spending it-s inﬂated income all
too hugely in a perfect orgy of
luxury buying. Sales of jewelry,
furs, cosmetics and alcoholic bev-
erages are at a record high, to
name no other examples, and
mount monthly into billions of
dollars.

This is indeed a situation over
which the American people should
be seriously concerned. “E” ‘bonds
—the people’s bond — are going
begging at a time when there is
great need for every person who
possibly can to make some direct
contribution to the war effort.
Adam Smith, bearer of the most
respected name in economics, took
pride in“ stating that above «all
else, he was a -patriot. We of the
present must not fail in today’s

call upon our patriotism.

l_3loo(—l Donors May

Dedicate Plasma

In response to requests from
blood donors throughout the coun-
try, a new Red Cross blood plas-
ma label has been designed which
enables a donor to sign his name
on -the label that goes on the
package to- the troops overseas and
to dedicate the blood in honor of
a friend or loved one in the
armed forces. This announcement
was made here today «by Roy G.
Bostwick, chairman, Pittsburgh
Blood Donor service, American
Red Cross.

The new plan became effective
December 7, Mr. Bos-twick sai-d,
and for each pint of blood donated
thereafter, the donor will be

allowed to inscribe a label in his_

own handwriting with his name
and the name of the serviceman
or woman in whose honor the
donation was made. The label will
-be pasted on the outside of stand-
ard army-navy packages of plas-
ma and shipped» overseas.

Mr. Bostwick said that the plan
had been adopted as‘ the result
of numerous requests by friends
and relatives of servicemen

transmits orders instantly, clearly. For the huge battleship
"Wisconsin,” Western Electric supplied two systems using
equipment designed by Bell Telephone Laboratories.

1. Sound powered telephone system—with 2200 instruments
connecting all battle stations. These battle phones operate op
current generated by the speaker’s voice, so damage to the ship 3
electrical power supply cannot interrupt communications.

2. Battle announcing system—with 20 transmitter stations
and over 300 giant-voiced loudspeakers.
Helping to supply "battle talk” equipment for use at sea, on

land and in the air is providing important work for many col-
lege graduates-—-both men and women—-at Western Electric.

Jingle Bells! Jingle Bells! And
all that sort of rot. We have a re-
quest to be exuding with Christ-
mas spirit this week, so in spite
of being a bit out of practice at
exuding—-(dormant, last week, re-
member?)—here’s To It.

Some of the biggest news on
campus includes Ruth (Pinky)
Crawford), who is wearing Lee
McFadden’s diamond ring. The
wedding is to be December 27,
and then Ruth will be off to Lee’s
base, an island off the coast of
Washington.

Another neat sparkler is now

being worn by Norma Mervosh,
who netted hers on a recent trip
to Chicago. It’s from one of those
Navy men.

More news about the hottest
copy man on campus. This past
week—end saw Bill (Love, Inc.)

with Jug (Yes, sir, he’s my Baby),

ford. That “friendship” ring on
his little ‘inger hasn’t got a Delt
crest on it. Need more be said—-
cept that the poor childhood
sweetheart is practically a bpsted
valentine about now?

The Dent Cafeteria is now a
trysting-place for Yvonne Roe-
buck and Gene Wojie.

Flash (Blinding, isn’t it?) Via
an anonymous letter comes this
bit of gossip. What Beta Sig
president (we’re dealing in subtle-
ties this week) recently refused
two frat pins in one week-end?-—
and they say times are tough!
Rumor says (we get more info
from this kid) that the refusal is
because of a smooth Sig Chi in an
eastern university.

Monday afternoon’s deadline
lasted long enough for us to catch
sight of Jan Radovan celebrating
her birthday in the Red Tuck
Shop. She managed to blow out
every single candle on the huge
cake presented to her by Larry
Bogart and a coupla’ other men.

Notes from a frayed type-writ-

Congress Asks
Deans To Set
Activity Hour

Question of the restoration of
an activities hour was discussed
at the November 27 meeting of
Student Congress. ‘The action
came as the result of dissatisfac-

tion among the student body with
present arrangements. The state-
ment of the Congress which was
presented to the deans of the
University reads as follow: '
“Present conditions are detri-
mental to student health and
scholarship and to the efficient
functioning of campus organiza-
tions. Student activities have no
convenient time in which to meet.
Many meetings are held during
the lunch hour; this -causes the
students either to skip eating al-
together or to gulp down a sand-
wich before rushing to class. The
full afternoon schedule necessi-
tates many extremely late meet-
ings which cause students with
evening classes to miss their din-
ners. Other activities are forced
to schedule evening meetings. In
order to attend these, the stu-
dents must buy their dinners out
and spend an unnecessarily long
and tiring day at the University.
Evening meetings, besides being
detrimental to health, cut down on
the students’ time for study. Often
they must arrive ‘home shortly
before midnight and then sit up to
do assignments for the next day.
Many students whose budgets can-
not bear the added expense of din-
ners or who commute long
distances are greatly limited in
their participation in activities by
these conditions. The activities
themselves are also handicapped
by lack of meeting time. Too many
meetings must be scheduled at
conflicting hours so that none of
the organizations concerned can

Men’s Debate
Makes Plans

Men’s Debating association,
completing its program for the
calendar year, has conc-luded its
high school program, and is mak-
ing plans for its ﬁrst college de-
bate tournament of the season
early in January.

The high school debate and dis-
cussion tournament, conducted on
December 2, brought over 700 high
school students and coaches to
the University. Students from
McKeesport and Cathedral high
schools took ﬁrst and second
places respectively in the elimina-
tion discussion contest which fea-
tured the day’s debating.

John McKinley, E, has sched-
uled an inter-collegiate debating
tournament for January 13. Ap-
proximately eight schools will en-
ter teams in two rounds of debate.
Both Men’s Debating and Wom-
en’s Speech associations will reg-
ister as separate groups for this
event.

Trips to the Western Pennsyl-
vania penitentiary and colleges in
the Pittsburgh district, including
Mount Mercy, are also scheduled
for January. A tournament for
novices in debate, both at Pitt and
Mount Mercy, is being planned.

Currently, Men’s Debating has
been conducting debates on the
college question each week at the
assooiation’s meetings in prepara-
tion for the coming tournaments.
The question is “Resolved, that
the national government enact
legislation forcing compulsory ar-
bitration of all labor disputes.”

Curtis Reviews Players’

Tonight At Eight

By Ford E. Curtis

“ Associate Professoraof English

The Pitt Players opened their
season and their program of four
one-act plays Thursday Nov. 31
at Foster Memorial wi-th a fantasy
that -in its ‘title, World Without

Men, states the chief probl-em of a’

campus theatre in wartime. For
the valiant services of the few
men who appeared in the pro-
gram, Miss -Haun and the ofiicers
of Pitt Players and of ‘T-heatron
mu-st !be grateful. They are to be
congratulated on going ahead so
ably with a campus organization
that has always meant much in
University life.

A late evening class kept me
from seeing all but the last few
minutes of Philip J ohnson’s World
Without Men. If, as one of my
scouts informed me, Abbie West-
Permian -took the lead after the play
had been in rehearsal some time,
she is especially to be commended
for the command she had of the
part. Selma Aronoif, simply and
effectively got the most out of
an a-musing «character. To Jean
_Busis, Shane Turets, Wilma
Ziefel, Jackie Robbins, and Frieda
Hammermeister, my apologies. I

understand they ﬁlled carpably
;heir roles in the play. '
"’DE??n'“33?”a‘éEf by EE1"w’vin McKinley
is a light ‘little farce that was the
hit of the evening. A mother with
social aspirations for her daughter
will not be imposed upon by the
millio-naire lord who poses as a
plumber to win the daughter’s
hand. Abbi-e Westerman, Miriam
Drumm, and Milton Tokash had
just the right accent of affect-
ed seriousness -to make the farce
delightful.

In- a Spanish romance by the
Quintero brothers, Sally Watkins
handled a difﬁcult role well.
Frank Fierts-chneider, remember-
ed as Pa in T-ho-rnton Wilder’s
A Happy Journey this ‘summer,
proved he is ready for heavier
assignments with the ‘Players.
Janice Segal as the maid and
Richard Davis as the yawning
serv-ant rounded out the -cast of
four adequately. The acting g-en-
erally was too slow-paced, espe-
cially for -a play so thin and obvi-
ous in its «plot.

The major opus of ‘the evening
was Marion Craig Wentworth’s

Panhellenic Meeting

wife and mother against war was
impressive early, but as the whole
performan-ce was at a high emo-
tional pitch, the occasional spots
of intense emotion in this diﬁi-cult
role were ov~ers'tr-essed. The acting
of Lilli-an Valli as the mother had
that quality of restraint and sup-
pressed emotions infrequently
met with in the -ama-teur theatre.
Martha Shissler met the 'test of
anoth-er -difﬁcult part quite ac-
ceptably. Oil the minor roles,
Eleanor Zusinas showed a spon-
taneity an-d ease that marked her
as ready for better roles. Among
the men, Richard Hazley -did a

French Students
Collect Clothes

For the past two weeks, “Le

French students, has been work-

people.

Girls dressed in -costumes repre-

orated with the tri—color of France,
has been set up on the ground

Now that the Interfraterni-ty]
Dance is over and all the boys
have return their tuxvedos to the
Alpha Dress Suit CO~.,r there’s
nothing left to do but talk about
the affair. And that’s just what
I’m going to do now, so latch
on and get the lowdown.

Reversing the usual procedure
this week, we're going ‘to talk
about the Sigma Chis first instead
of last. This honor comes because
they won the Sing at the dance.
The ﬁrst placers gave out with
The Sweetheart of Sigma Chi and
a ﬁne George M. Cohan medley.
Con-gratulations to the Sigs; we’»ll
listen to that kind of singing any
time.

The Delts are in for a word of
praise also, because they took sec-
ond place in the Sing. They sang
This Is My Country an-d Delta
Shelter, which featured a solo by
Bob Buell. While they w—ere sing-
ing, Barnhart was -cracking his
knuckles on the ‘piano.

The «Phi Eps sang, My Heart
Tells Me This Is Just a Fling. And
it was. \

Phi Delts really gave a swell
arrangement of Don’t Fence Me
In. Since the dance that’s ‘become
one of my favorite -songs.

Getting back to the campus, I'm
told -that the Alpha Omega Dental

honor of the 1-6 seniors who will

By Moe Spiegel,

Let’s be generous this Christmas and toss presents around ‘like
all blazes. I have a ﬁne gift for Coach Shaughnessy and Jimmy
- _ Hagan. Realizing that the Pitt team next season can’t be much

better than the Panthers of this past season, I have asked Santa for

a nice schedule for the 1945 gridders. The jovial old man stroked
his whiskers and thought for a minute. “Well,” he murmured, “Why

» not give 9the Pitt team a schedule that will not allow anybody to
5‘ make excuses?” So, my Christmas parcel to the squad is this sched-
ule. Let’s open with Notre Dame and show the people we got lots
of guts. y They’ll see the guts coming out of the players anyway.

V Follow this contest with Army and then Navy in successive weeks.
The football fans will then be able to match the two service elevens
early in the season, and there won’t be all that fuss as to who’s better.

1 For the fourth game, we will play a breather such as Great Lakes.
“ ter all, we almost beat that bun-ch back in 1943. Remember? Game
umber ﬁve is Ohio State. The Buckeyes aren't as good as people
hink, and we will prove it when we get them on our own gridiron.
glext in line will be our cousins from across the state, Munger’s Penn-
fsylvanians. They play a nice brand of ball. Michigan’s Wolverines
 are number seven on the slate. Duke’s Blue Devils would look nice
the following week, and we could certainly avenge a couple of trounc-
ings by knocking them off. I have a breather lined up for the ninth
game and that contest will ﬁnd Penn State coming here to take an-
other licking. The last game is the toughest and an open date for
one week would be in order before Pitt closes its season with the
"mighty Tartans of Carnegie Tech. Oh ‘yes, Tech will have a team
next year. My spies tell me that Art Rooney and his Steelers are
going into a combine with the Plaid from Schenley Park. So, the last
contest will be the mighty Pitt Panthers against the plaid Carnegie
Steelers. My only problem is, who will be good enough to play Pitt
in the ROSE BOWL after a season like that? How about the Chicago

Bears?

Really Getting Hot
Now that I’m warmed up, I’ll give Coach Carlson a schedule for
his “Reindeer” of next season. He can have his choice of the teams
throughout the country and can line up any 30 games he sees fit.
Then, no one can say that Pitt is trying to sneak into a post season
playoff in Madison Square garden by way of the back door. Wouldn’t
.“Reindeer’-’ be a nice name for Pitt? Think how the headlines would

Pitt Army Team
In M any League '

Some former outstanding basket-
ball players from Pitt, who in
their undergraduate Gays played
for either Doc Carlson or in intra-
mural games, are still earnestly
bagging ﬁeld goals and working
out oﬁensive plays for a Pitt team.

Such familiar names as Steve
Zernich, Jack Glenn, “Hack”
White, and “Red” Silverman are
among them.

With Army students drawn
from both Pitt’s Med and Dent
schools, the boys have formed the
Pitt Army team and are one of 8
clubs which comprise the Munici-
pal Basketball League. , ‘

Under the able coaching of Dr.
William Ruhe, faculty member of
the Pitt Medical School, the Pitt
Army ﬁve conducts practice games
in the sub-basement gymnasium
in the Cathedral. The quintet has

°Initial Tilt

At Meadville

By Larry Bondy

Dr. Carlson and his Fearless
Phantoms to-ss their hats into the
1944-45 basketball hoop on Fri-
day night against Allegheny Col-
lege in Meadville. The Phantoms
aim to give the ’Gators, who lost
a 59-41 decision to Gannon Col-

lege of Erie, their second ‘home
defeat of the season. The Meth-
odists di-scontinued basketball last
season because -of -the low -male
enrollment, but are now «back on
the active list with an inexperi-
enced, outﬁt. '

This year’s Pitt squad has more
height and experience since Uncle
Sam found other uses for the
boys. Hank Zellers and ‘Phil Mar-
der are both former Muny League
performers and Nate Apple and

sonmen. The remainder of this
year’s squad consists mostly of
freshmen. Some new faces which
have shown up since «the close
of the football season are Con-
stantino, ‘ a former Avalon s-ta‘l‘,
Sarles, Marazeuski, -Pepper, Zim-
movan, the boy who snared Rick-

ton. From this aggregation Dr.
Carlson expects to find some tal-
ent to aid him in his Win ’em All
season.

Starting the ﬁrst game on for-
eign soil will be 6-foot-3-inch
Hank Zellers at the pivot posi-
tion,
busy night getting the ball off
the backboard. Nate Apple will
cover one of the forward posts,
while it
Tay Malarkey, whose leg is «hold-
ing up very well under the stren-
uous practice sessions, or Phil
Marder will be at the other for-
ward position. Morris and Can-
terno, the only ‘two freshmen-
among the first six, will be the
guards.

The captain for the Allegheny
game will be Tay Malarkey, a
veteran of the 1942-43 squad.
Considering the fact that Malar-
{key is a senior, in all probability
he will be the season's captain.

Winter weather brings harsh
treatment to sensitive lips. But
with a tube of Roger & Gallet
original Lip Pomade in your
pocket, you can laugh at “Sloppy
Sleet”.

Just smooth on Lip Pomade’s
invisible, soothing film and defy
the climate. There's no safer,
surer protection against painful
chapping and cracking.

Stop at any drug store and ask
for the handy pocket tube.

trict averaged less in October
than in September. Slight de-
crease.s in industrial production
and trade volume accounted for
the setback. Judging from the
seven—point decrease in the -busi-
ness index for October from the
178.2, highest recorded level dur-
ing last January, the wartime
peak in business seems to have
passed.

Steel activity in the Pittsburgh
district rose a little -early in Oc-
tober, but bituminous coal pro-
duction sagg-ed mainly because of
labor trouble.

Retail buying was heavy despite
shortages in some kinds of mer-
chandise. Combined -dollar volume
in Pittsburgh department stores
from the beginning of January
to November" 4 was nine per cent
ahead of the total of a compar-
able period last year, the Bureau
states.

 Exceeded  
By Drive Here
For Bond Sale

In an intense local war bond
drive here, the War Finance com-
mittee, chairmaned by Jackie
Goodman, C, exceeded its goal of
$8,275 by more than $12,40'0r0‘. The
drive, which officially opened
November 20, will close Friday,
December 15.

Official ﬁgures compiled Mon-
day of this week placed Phi Sigma
Sigma fraternity at the top .of
organization sales on bamvpus.
Alpha Epsilon Phi and Phi Mu
were second and third respec-'
tively.

According to Jackie Goodman,

Pitt -men and women rcooperated
with the War Finance committee
far beyond her ﬁrst expectations.
“The enthusiasm of the students
was most edifying,” she said. “I
wish to thank all those who helped
in any way whatsoever. However,
I hope no one will forget the
drive will not terminate for two
days yet. As o.f now, -the com-
mittee has received more than

$‘2'0,0i0.'0, enough to buy 2% ducks .
(-a ‘duck’ is a 2% ton amphibian ‘

truck). We would like to be a-ble
to purchase three ducks, if it is at
all possible.”

Louise Johnson, C, assistant
chairman of the Pitt drive, added,
“Students will .be able to buy
bonds or stamps in the booth on
(the ground ﬂoor of the Cathedral
from 11:30 to 3:30 0’-clock until
December 15.
