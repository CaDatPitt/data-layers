mean to say that this spirit is lack-

that they were ever imbued with any

Anglo-Saxon race, some of present, but
none of_ the future." A frightfully

biased statement aseven I admitted be-

fore leaving that Island. ' I even con-_
ceded that some of their institutions
were quite delightful. The tea custom
enamored me from the very ﬁrst, and
the people n the “s_hops"_(store_s) were
charming. ‘ *

Reverting again to tea, I think it

pretty ‘well typiﬁes the difference be-,,,

tween their lives,. and ours. They are a
people who have lived long in one land,
and have learned thatthe wise rule of
living is to‘ take time for wholesome-
human intercourse. Our conception‘ of
life as a period of frenzied, activity’ eup-
peals to them not at all. Time-of in-
activity t othem is not idleness, but leis-
ure, and it need not be considered wasted
_ A I won-
der ‘if we wou-ldn’t be the bett 1' off slow-
ing down our lives a triﬂe, even enough
to permit time for tea, and a little
decentrconversation. . .

My ﬁrst evening in England was ex-
tremely depressing: We landed about.
dusk and were allowed to roam the city
till midnight. ._ - _

I .  Lbark city. ' .

{It was the opposite of the exuberant
time you might reasonably expect for
our first night ashore. It was our ﬁrst

experience of a darkened city. The a.nti-- ‘

air craft precautions are stringent, and
thisliity at least was almost unrelieved.
Even yet I can imagine nothing more
gloomy. Here and there you would see
a. light pathetically struggling to pierce
the 0-ppressing gloom, sputtering fright-
fully as if overwhelmed with the huge-

-ness of its task. Thepeople shoulder-lug"

past you unseen, appeared like members
of a shadowed race. The unlighted coun-

tryside may appear ‘natural and ‘life-

like, but a darkened city, a child of light,
as it were,‘ is a deadsthing.

But more of this again. I ﬁnally suc-
ceeded in ﬂying this 1, morning after
.more than two months on the ground. I
was curious ‘to see whether any of the
sensations of my first ﬂight would re-
turn. However ‘they idn't.' A11 appeared
natural,. and this though I traveled from
the wheel .to the stick control. The only
new element was the snow. It makes
the estimation of «distances vertical-—I
mean extremely confusing. On coming
down you hazard a guess as to the loca-
tion‘ of the ground, then hope your guess
is not too many feet off the true.

  OPERATORS

A. R. Hamilton,."94, well known
Pitt alumnus, has 'been_ playing an
important part in handling the
troublesome fuel -problem in» the
Pittsburgh district .during the strenu-
ous months which have just pass?
The Pittsburgh papers last week co -
tained an article whicli told of Mr.
Hamilton being elected president of
the newly-formed Northwestern
Pennsylvania Coal Operators’ Asso-
ciation. ' This ‘association has for its
members the leading coal operators
of Butler, Mercer, Lawrence,.Arm-
strong, Clarion, VVestmoreland, Jef-
ferson and .I-ndiana Counties, and its
primary object is to co-operate with
the government officials in increasing
the coal prdduction of the districts.

Universityisi admitted this year with
Frank Shea, the A. A, U. National
440 Champion, in theiheight of form.

.-Shea, as‘ everyone knows, won the
title last year at St. Louis,,and pre-
vious to .-that "hard defeated“ the -great
“Ted” Meredith in Philadelphia. '~.I.n
addition to_ Shea there are several
other real‘ classyj track “performers inl
the University who have a good
chance t9, go to the meet. .When
they do, they will be opposed to the
best talent of Yale, Harvard, Cornell,
Princetovn, Pelmsyllvanlia. «and other
big Eastern .1sch'ools. .

.Pitt’s admission-to this'Asso.ciation
is real-lyan epoch in the history -of
our athletics, as it gives uslth-e recog-
nition..'wi_t‘h the larger schools which
we have long hoped for. A number
of years ago admission .was granted
to any college I or university that
made an_‘_application, 'but. in recent
years the bars were put up and 'no
institution was admitted until acare—'
ful investigation was made of its
eligibility code and method of con-

ducting all athletics. This was done
in the c-ase -of our University, and the
fact thatthe vote was unanimously
in favor of our admission shows that

 one of the leaders in that par-
jicular ﬁeld of university work.

FOR FRESHMEN

\\/inning games have come =to be a
habit with the Pitt Freshmen as evi-
denccd by the ‘two victories they
chalked up during the last week. In
the preliminary to the State game,
the yearlings gained the decision in
a rather interesting encounter with
the Bellevue High quintet. The re-
cons»tructed,lineup, with M.'cCrory at
center, performed in whirlwind
style and completely squelched the
fine eFforts of the A prep lads.
Johnny McCrory at center did the
lion’s sha_re of the scoring, hanging
up 6 ﬁeld goals at opportune times.
Kelly and Ross helped out cons-ider—
ably, each registering a quartet of
markers. Schuster and Lockwood
held up their end well and by their
eﬁorts kept‘ their team in the run-
ning during the evening. ‘ '

On Friday evening, while the Var-
sity was at VV:ashington, the Greenies
jaunted down ’ to Wayneslbu-rg and
rornped all over the. High lads: In
this game McCrory showed that his

-lerel 7 field goals and played -a fast,
aggressive ﬂoor game. Kelly played
up to form and ‘contributed 6 ringers
to the cause. A _large delegation of
WaAynes‘burgites turned» out’ to see
Ross, the native son, who holds down-

sponded with 3‘ﬁe1d goals and an ex-
traordinary -exhibition of general
ﬂoor work.

In both these games, the work of
the freshmen was deserving -of great
praise. Coach Ochsenhir't’s feat‘ of
ﬁlling «the flcanc-iles left _by Silber—
Asteiri and Mervis is -particularly note-

now has working together performs
in as smooth style as.the' team that
started the. season. Only -one defeat
-has been registered against the first

of which only one more‘ game re-
mains. Manager Paul has handled
the business end‘ of the game in. mas-.
terly shape both at "home. and on the,
road. The cleverly arranged sched-
ule hasjbeen a ‘big factor in the won-
derful showing of‘ the team. S-cores:
