(lnearthing the next
‘campus of the future’

By Mike Bucsko
The Pitt News

Y OU will soon be able to locate an
estimated 250 million items ofinforma—
tion, from the currency used in Bombay
to the latest research report from the Falk
Clinic, thanks to an agreement between the
University of Pittsburgh and AT&T Infor-
mation Systems.

The multi—million dollar joint project,
deemed the “campus of the future," by its
promoters, will eventually enable the 45,000
students, faculty and administrators here to
plug into the world’s first integrated fiber
optics communications system and receive
information by voice, video or computer
data.

The integrated fiber optics communica-
tions system is due to be installed on the
Oakland campus beginning this summer and
work will continue for the next three years,
according to assistant provost Dr. Ray

Steele.

University lays groundwork

for information network

“We are the prototype university for this
approach," said Steele, who wrote Pitt’s
proposal for the project last June.

Steele described the wiring as the back-
bone of a system he said will eventually con-
nect every building on the Oakland campus
with regional campuses at the touch of a
computer keyboard.

The fiber optics system differs from other
systems, like copper wiring and coaxial
cables used by cable companies, because of
the capability of fiber optics to carry voice,
video and computer data at once.

Another advantage the project will have
over other systems is that it will be an open
system, therefore allowing other computer
technology, besides that of AT&T, to mesh
with the system. Negotiations are currently
under way with the Digital Electronics Cor-
poration to purchase computers, and the
university recently signed an agreement with
Xerox for word—processing equipment.

The financial advantage ofthe fiber optics
system is that all three aspects of informa-
tion retrieval —— voice, video and data — are

carried on one system, therefore eliminating -

the costly need for separate systems that
would be necessary if, for instance, copper
wire were used exclusively, according to Dr.
David Forejt. associate senior vice-
chancellor for administration. Chancellor
Wesley Posvar estimates the system will
reduce costs and increase productivity by
$20 million over the next three years.

How much the project will cost, however,
varies depending on the source of the esti-
mate. Posvar said at a Dec. 14 news confer-
ence that the cost would be less than the
university’s $3.5 million annual telephone
bill. But a Dec. 15 article in The Wall Street
Journal quoted anonymous university offi-
cials at $8 million. Steele estimated the cost
at one third of the $20 million projected
savings. Forejt said it will be in the “multi-
millions" when additional equipment, like
computer terminals, are added. Those cost
estimates only include the installation of
AT&T wiring. 2

Puzzuoli, Atiyeh stand trial for police incident  

By John Gambesda
The Pitt News

Trial proceedings for Dennis
Atiyeh and Dave Puzzuoli, the two
Pitt football players arrested last
February on charges of aggravated
assault, terroristic threats and resist-
mg arrest, began Wednesday morn-
ing before Common Pleas judge
Loran Lewis.

Atiyeh and Puzzuoli were
arrested on Feb. 20, I983, in front of
the steps leading to the Towers dor-
mitories on Forbes Avenue after an
altercation that eventually involved
as many as eight police officers.

Today’s proceedings included tes-
timony from police officer Michelle
Stack in which she said that
DeVelma Coleman’s night stick

more than likely was broken over
someone‘s head. - I

Coleman, Stack‘s partner, later
testified that her night stick broke in
a fall during the melee.

Coleman told thejury that she still
suffers back pain as a result of the
brawl and said that she is still seeing
a physician nearly a year after the
incident.

Assistant district attorney Jeff
Wiley is winding down his case after
calling eight witnesses, including six
Pittsburgh police officers and two
physicians.

The officers, all of whom were
somehow involved in the incident,
gave their individual accounts of
what occurred during the early
morning hours of Feb. 20.

Police first encounterd Puzzuoli
in front of a Chinese restaurant on
Forbes at about 7:30 p.m. He was

told to leave the area and later was
asked to move away from the front
of the Sanctuary Bar on Bouquet
Street.

Minutes later, Atiyeh pulled up in
front of the Wooden Keg, and Puz-
zouli approached the car to speak to
him. Patrol car No. 4l, carrying
officers Carl Metz and John
Schwartzmeir, then - pulled up
behind Atiyeh’s car. Soon after,
another patrol car pulled in front of
Atiyeh‘s.

After being told by the police to
move on, Atiyeh got out of the car
and proceeded towards the Towers
with Puzzuoli.

Stack and Coleman testified that
after returning from a fire alarm call.
both passed the 3900 block of
Forbes and saw fellow officers

- speaking to the defendants but were

waved on. As they reached the end
of the block, they heard on their
radio that a fight had broken out in
the area they had just passed. They
quickly returned to the scene.

As they approached the scene,
Coleman and Stack observed that
officers Metz and Schwartzmier had
Puzzuoli held against the wall. Stack
jumped out of the slowly moving

van, and Coleman brought it to a

stop. Four or five officers had
become involved in the confronta-
tion and were trying to lead Puzzuoli
to the van. Officer Kimberly Mon-
roe attempted to handcuff Puzzuoli
but could only secure one cuff on
him before he broke the hold.

Coleman testified that after stop-
ping the van and reaching for her
night stick, she observed Stack being
thrown onto the hood of a patrol
car.

Coleman further testified that a
large crowd had gathered, with peo-
ple pushing and shoving every-
where. She noticed that Atiyeh was
continuously interfering and saying,
“Let him go. He’s my friend. Just let
him go, and everything will be all
right." She said that Puzzuoli then
somehow broke away from the six
police officers and landed on top of
another officer.

Coleman testified that Puzzuoli
then leaped at her, picked her up by
the knees and threw her to the
ground.

Coleman said that as a result of
the fall, she has suffered from a
major neck injury, along with other
minor complications.

Dr. Ronald Pifer, an orthopedic
surgeon who examined and treated

Coleman shortly after‘ her release
from Montefiore Hospital, said that
Coleman did suffer an injury to her
third cervical vertebra. However, an
admissions report brought out dur-
ing the trial revealed that Coleman
had suffered a neck injury two years
prior to this incident.

After hearing this, Pifer said that
he would like to examine Coleman
again to see if the first injury had
anything to do with the present
injury.

Puzzuoli and Atiyeh have yet to
present their defenses.

Atiyeh’s attorney, Sam Sciullo,
said he believes the outcome of the
trial will depend on which side the
I2-member jury determines is more
credible.

“Oftentimes, it happens that one
party is lying,” Sciullo said. “Our
judicial system leaves it up to the
jury to determine who is more
credible." V

Atiyeh did not want to comment
specifically on the trials progress
but did say, “We can only wait until
everything comes out in the open.
Both parties are allowed to speak
their piece, and the court hasn't
heard our side yet."

»Pitt, AT&T set sights on future

‘The number one thing

you can be sure of is

that whatever we implement and plan will

change tomorrow. ’

-Dave F orejt

Q continued from page one

“The cost of all that will be quite
big, and that‘s what I'm grappling
with now," Forejt said. “We can say,
without a doubt, that it’s going to be
a lot of money."

The wiring will be installed under-
ground, by gutting existing AT&T
conduits and replacing the copper
wiring with fiber optics. Forejt said
that, in some cases. existing copper
wiring will be retained to comple-
ment the fiber optics.

In addition, the university will
become its own telephone company,

at an aspect of the project directly

attributable to the government-
ordered divestiture of AT&T. Steele
said students will be able to log onto
the system as easy as making a tele-
phone call., '

“You should be able to, on this
campus, pick up a phone or log onto
a terminal and get what you want
any time of the day," Steele said.

What you want may vary,

“*depending on your major or your
area of interest. A project called
“Trainer," for database search train-
ing, is currently being developed by
Nick Caruso, research associate pro-
fessor at the Graduate School of
Public and International Affairs,
and his wife, Dr. Elaine Caruso, a
special consultant to the project.

The Trainer project will train indi-
viduals specifically in searching the
numerous databases, like DIALOG

a or ORBIT. Though the Trainer pro-

ject is still in the experimental stage,

the Carusos said “it has a lot of
potential."

Forejt, an employee of Westing-
house Research and Development
Center before joining the university
staff on Dec. I, said it is difficult to
set a timetable for completion of the
complete network because of the
constant innovations in computer
technology.

He said that most of the wiring
should be completed by the end of
this year, but he was hesitant to set
an exact date when all the capabili-
ties ofthe system would be available.

“What absolutely will be done in
three years is to get transmission
working and in place,” he said. “The
No. l thing you can be sure ofis that
whatever we implement and plan
will change tomorrow.”

A similar system is now in place at
Walt Disney World’s EPCOT Cen-
ter, and Forejt explained the value
of the system to an academic envir-
onment. For instance, touch-
sensitive screens are used at EPCOT
for visitors to locate restaurants.
The more you touch the screen, the
more detailed the descriptions
become.

Laser discs are used to visually
escort the visitor into the restaurant
as a guest. Forejt said that some
scholarly areas, like art, that do not
rely on the written word could be
helped by the use of video cassettes
and laser discs. ’

campus

“We envision a video distribution
center somewhere in the university,”
he said, “and a faculty member
could request a video cassette to be
shown in the classroom. It would
eliminate the need for‘VCRs and
projectors."

Briefing sessions about the project
will be held for anyone interested in
more information on Jan. 27 at ll
a.m. and 2 p.m. in 2P56 Forbes
Quadrangle.

Pro gre s s P
This month, the university, in conjunction with AT&T, will
install the first part of a communication system that will

include fiber optic transmission (information carried on pulses
of light from a‘ laser) of voice, data and video. The system,
according to its creators, will turn Pitt into the university of the
future.

The fear is that it may also turn Pitt into nothing more than a
finishing school for technocrats.

The network will run throughout the Oakland campus and
will later include all of the branch campuses. This will be the
first system of its type at any university and is bound to bring

tremendous publicity to the university, as well as an $8 million
price tag.

The new system will no doubt put Pitt in the national -
possibly international —— limelight and should attract many
excellent faculty and students, as well as research opportuni-
ties, within the field of computer science.

Unfortunately, the university has restricted this outstanding
action to an area of very limited access. The new system is no
doubt a response, in part, to all ofthe acclaim Carnegie-Mellon
University has received for being one of the nation's most
outstanding robotics and engineering schools in the country.

CMU has already been accused of being nothing more than a
graduate technical school and has let many of its non-science
departments deteriorate. With the addition of this system, Pitt
can expect to receive advances from business limited to the
high-tech field. This would pose a real threat to the nature ofa
university as a place of higher learning for all studies. The
direction of CMU, one hopes, will not be the one Pitt will take
— that of a business that caters itself to the lucrative and
fashionable trends of the day.

Yesterday, Education Secretary T. H. Bell criticized the over-
emphasis on learning computer programs. Bell claimed schools
were turning out “electric page turners” and that there is a need
to increase students’ abilities in basic English and math. To
strive to make advances in the sciences and to be at the fore-
front of technology are excellent goals for a university. The
only requisite is that the university not installthese advances at
the expense of the other areasvof study.

Misguided Acts

The assassination Wednesday of Malcolm Kerr, president of
the American University of Beirut, offers tragic evidence that
Americans around the globe have become the targets ofterror—
ist attacks solely by virtue of being Americans.

Radical terrorist groups inthe Middle East and other parts
of the world have apparentlyfailed to distinguish their actual
enemies 1- American spies, for example -— from scholars and
other citizens whose only crime was that they hailed from the
United States. This latter group of victims of violence has too
often paid with their lives for a growing perception ofthe U.S.
as an international bully.

Professors are seen in some terrorist circles as a great threat
and are commonly accused of being CIA agents, according to
Pitt political scientist Richard‘ Cottam.

The recent history of U.S. foreign policy has shown that
Third World peoples have valid reason to suspect wrongful
intervention by the CIA and other American organizations.
One example of spying by American professors was Project
Camelot, in which the Army conducted a secret $6 million
investigation of revolutionary movements throughout Latin
America during the 1960s.

Nationalists around the world would do well to recognize
that misguided acts of violence are not only morally wrong but
also counterproductive to their long-term goals. At the same
time, a more humane U.S. foreign policy, especially in matters
of espionage, would go a long way toward halting the wave of
indiscriminate anti-Americanterrorism. I



   
  
   

      
      

Letters To The  Editor

Medical
budget

policies
defended

Given the wide interest in the Pitt
medical school and the strong opin-
ions held about it, the report by the
Senate Budget Policies Committee
on the impact of Practice Associa-
tion at Pitt was bound to generate
public comment. However, it is most
surprising that anyone, even a very
partisan reader, can draw from it the
conclusion that Dr. Glew‘s charges
(Letter, Jan. 16, 1984) against the
school have been "endorsed by the
committee.

In fact, conclusions one and two
of the report state specifically that
the plight ofthe basic science depart-
ments and the high tuition rates in
the medical school - while very real
problems —— do not seem to be
caused by the establishment or the
existence of the practice
associations.

Increased practice income has
contributed measurably to an
improvement of the financial health
of the medical school, which is suf-
fering from reduced public support:

this has been documented in the
report. The committee did have
some critical comments. They con-
cerned the large and continuing
annual deficit and a seemingly

‘ unbalanced growth of the school‘s

faculty.

The report notes/some evidence
for weaknesses in the governance of
the medical school, but nowhere
does it say or imply that manage-
ment was “ineffectual," ill-
intentioned or worse. It did not call
for the resignation of anyone;
rather, it called for the greater invol-
vement of the chancellor to help in
accomplishing goals that are sup-
ported by most people inside and
outside the school.

Our medical school '— as any
medical school —— is a complex
structure of many overlapping
responsibilities and authorities, and
a simplistic witch hunt will not do.
There is a lot to be proud of in the
medical and scientific accomplish-
ments of Pitt's medical school. The
committee fully,shares this pride. I
certainly do.

The committee’s recommenda-
tions for an improved governance
and fiscal administration aim to
strengthen the school, not to polar-

ize it. They were carefully consi-

dered and carefully worded.
Therefore, it is not useful to sum-
marize them “in other words."

It also is not necessary; the report
is available to Pitt faculty and stu-
dent leaders from the clerk of the
University Senate, 1234 CI. for the
asking. Interested parties who read
the report carefully will find it rather
unlike Dr. Glew’s rendering in his
Jan. 16 letter to The Pitt News.

Walden: a 

new idea

In this time of great world strife,
trouble and complexity, reliefto and
for the people is needed. More than
a slogan or rhetoric is required to
carry out this momentous task of
revelation and sanctuary. The hot

ideas, causes and crazes of men need.,i

a chance for sanctuary and
restoration.

A new idea for intellectual
thought and consideration needs to
be brought to the fore of mankind's
consciousness. Something so
extraordinary that its purpose and
being of rightness can be debated by
no one, only accepted by people
everywhere.

This ideal may sound utopian to
those who have no vision or cannot
understand it. Be gone, you dino-

saurs ofthought. This new ideal only ‘,
covets the truly free andjust thinkers’

—— the new wave ofidea makers. But,
no more with such platitudes and
pontificating; the time of unveiling is
here for such an idea, an idea whose
time has come, an idea that no dino-
saur can trample: -

“Walden,“ where political and
social defection are just around the
corner; where, when the going gets

weird, the weird turn pro (Dr. Hun-
ter S. Thompson).
True converts will understand,~the

naive and unknowing will learn. The ,

dull and thoughtless will never
know. Look out, Ronnie and Yuri, a
new destiny has fallen upon the
world. To those who do not know
where Walden is and wish to , look
inward to the heart and soul of your

‘existence (a little rhythm and blues

helps).

If it is still not to be found, then
you are not one of Walden. For you,
life will be no more than cocktail
lounges and plastic. So be it. Walden
is here!

Before the Dawn/Adam Eisenstat

I was recently in the position of
having to ask a professor if he would
admit me to his closed class. I
greeted the stodgy academic in his
book-lined office and tried my best
to field his'probing inquiries as to
my ability to handle his (as he told
me several times) very demanding
class.

I tried to make it look as good as
possible. I had no great desire to

take his class, but I needed one to fill

a vacant spot on my heavily altered
schedule. I told him that the begin-
ning of a term is such a hectic time,
and even one who plans his schedule
as carefully as I do sometimes over-
looks a class he really wants to take.
“You better get organized, boy,“ he
said.

Then he asked me what year I was
in and what my major was. “Junior,
none,” I replied. In the same conde-
scending tone in which he told me to
get organized, he said I was waiting
far too long to get a grasp on my
destiny.

“I don’t see any real difference
between someone who has no major
and someone with a liberal arts
major who takes a few more courses
in one specific field,” I told him. “I
don't believe that all the ‘answers’
are concentrated in any one field. I
think its important to get a taste of
many subjects while in school."

He countered this argument by
saying, “That’s called dilettantism.“
As I left his office, convinced I
would never see him again. I said I

would seriously consider his com-
merit on dilettantism.

One who believes that he has a
firm grasp on life and has, in fact,
found a career or academic disci-
pline to f)cus on in depth tends to
perceive dilettantism much more
readily than do us “dilettantes" or
less pejoratively, eclectics.

Eclecticism is more or less the
domain of the young. Before the
walls of such obscentities as respon-
sibility -- usually the economic and
familial breed -—— and inertia close in,
eclecticism should be celebrated‘ to
its height.

I reflect on the old professor.

Opinions

his ilk. For them, it is not enough to
merely renounce the vitality of
youth and discovery for the slow
death of commitment and passive
scholarship; they feel compelled to
pontificate, to “steer”and “guide"
the young and aimless.

In the ’50s and ’60s, when eco-
nomic conditions were much more
hospitable for everyone, the aimless
and eclectic thrived. This is
obviously not the case anymore. It is
much less possible and satisfactory
to pursue a life ofanything but mate-
rial stability.

Along with this cold, hard reality
goes the stagnation of intellectual
life in America’s universities. Prag-
matic and specialized education may
provide for a life of comfort, but it

does nothing whatsoever to vitalize

In praise of youth and dilettantism

the university atmosphere. The fact
is that pragmatism and specializa-
tion in educaton corrode and clog
the mind of the student. Everyone
ultimately pays with the utter insi-
pidity of the college campus, which
is reduced to the role of weigh sta-
tion and provider of diversions for
the restive seekers of responsibility.

Planning for the future canbe a
very worthwhile thing. Organization
is more than just worthwhile; it’s
necessary. But allegiance to these
principles can be very morbid for the
life of the mind. I don’t urge anyone
to go through school with anything
but his best interests at heart. For
my money, though, I don’t plan to
piddle away four years of my life
being anything but a dilettante.

Last week, it was necessary for me
to visit several different offices in
various university buildings. These
offices were organized by Pitt to
provide a wide variety of services to
students and staff and resulted in a
multitude of staff positions for the
university personnel department to
fill. My business with these depart-
ments gave me the opportunity to
see first-hand the conduct and per-
formance of the people chosen to fill
these positions.

If what I saw is an accurate repre-
sentation of the Pitt organization as
a whole, I must put forth the propo-
sition that the university is over-
staffed with employees who are
grossly underworked and lacking in
motivation. This deadwood is not
only a drain on scarce university
funds but also results in hindering
the departments that are trying to
reach higher levels of effectiveness
and efficiency.

A few examples supporting my
feelings include:

0Personnel due in at 9 a.m. not
showing up until 9:20 or 9:30. When
I asked the staff who were on time
about this, they expressed little con-
cern ~ being late in the morning or

.after lunch is the norm‘?

0Atmospheres so casual and
pressure-free that even the most lib-
eral organizational behaviorist
would have to admit the resulting
inefficiency.

OWork performed at a snail’s pace
in order to make what little there
was last a full eight hours.

0Poor attitudes among staff rang-
ing from total apathy and uncooper-
ation to resentment for those
persons making them get up out of
their chairs to do something.

As I write this, I can hear the
future howls of defense and denial
from the guilty parties. I would not
expect anything less; it is a natural
and sensible reaction to defend an
attack on our source of income or
job performance. No one is going to
admit to himself or others that he is
lazy or underworked. As a matter of
fact, I imagine that the people whose
blood pressures are rising now really
believe that they do work hard.

But it is all relative -- three people
are used to sharing the work that one
could handle and the third person
leaves, the remaining two will never-
theless feel like they are carrying the
weight of the world.

Inefficiency, waste and overstaf-
fing are often seen as inevitable pro-
ducts of large organizations.
Whether it is Rockwell Interna-
tional, a county government or a
hospital, the large size of these
organizations often render them
unwieldy. The aggrandizement of
power and influence, the self-

preservation motive and other self-

ish interests all facilitate the further
expansion of these organizations.
In the private sector, however, the
profit motive tempers this expan-
sion tendency by examining pro-
posed increases of staff and services
with an eye towards the income
statement. The recent recession
intensified this need for restraint;
corporations that have survived
have done so by becoming leaner.
Surely President Reagan’s reign
has caused many non-profit organi-
zations dependent on federal aid to
take a harder look at their budgets
and staff requirements. Layoffs have
resulted. Many necessary and bene-
ficial services have been forfeited.
But at the risk of appearing insensi-
tive, one might ask if governmental

aid had not been reduced and if an
endless stream of tax dollars con-
tinued to pour in, would the organi-
zations have been motivated to
examine their structures to maxim-
ize the use ofa dollar? Ofcourse not.

When someone else is supplying
the dollars, it is only natural to
enhance your position by accepting
them, whether or not they are truly
needed. Do you think the Joint
Chiefs of Staff would say, “No, Mr.
President. We don‘t want another
$lO billion.” Do you think Foge
Fazio would turn down the oppor-
tunity to have another assistant or
two?

Thus, an_increase in staff and
structure results from these exces-

sive funds. Without a profit motive
or an economic crisis, what exists to
force the powers—that-be to examine
the organization for waste?

Department heads will continue
to ask for bigger budgets and
increased staff. Trustees will con-
tinue to approve their requests
because they are out of touch with
what really goes on and are easily
misled. ’

You can be sure if it were their
own dollars, they wouldn’t approve
a single position with a name like
“administrative assistant to the vice-
chancellor for the promotion of stu-
dent and faculty interaction." The
work load decreases; people get laz-

’ ing

 Pitt should unload uncaring staff members

ier, and less work gets done. So more
people are hired.

Needless to say, I am not address-
every department or staff
member. There are many necessary
departments employing dedicated,
caring professionals. They make life
a lot easier for us. They provide
needed services with a smile. But if
you are one ofthe ones feelinga little
guilty right now, take the show and
kick yourself out of the university
with it.

It is allan idealistic dream. But the
dream is based on managerial con-
cepts that Pitt is teaching in its

should practice what it teaches.

For centuries the mysterious Tarot
has been a source of fascination
and inspiration to western man.

While Tarot cards are most commonly\

thought of today as a device for
fortune telling, they have been
used by scholars such as C.G.Jung

as a chronicle of the human experi-
ence and a key t9 unlocking psycholo-
gical concerns. In this introduction

to the Tarot we will examine the
psychological and symbolic signifi-
cance of these cards. Students

will also be taught how to perform
their own Tarot readings.

Pul7lic's New Production
/lstounds, As Usual

By IONATHAN KUNKEL

The Pittsburgh Public Theater
starts the new year with a hang with
it's current production of K2.

It catches the eye as soon as you
enter the newly-arranged house
(from an arena setup to an end stage)
because you're greeted by an enor-
mous structure made of wood. As the
house lights fade and the stage lights
come up, the mountainous set of ply-
wood instantly becomes the side of a
mountain (thanks to the help of pro-
iections).

From this moment on, you are
transported to a ledge 1,741 feet
below the summit of the world's
second highest mountain, K2, which
is located in Pakistan's Karakoram
range. On this ledge are Taylor and
Harold, two climbers who have been
separated from their expedition.
Harold has a severely—injured leg
because of a fall and is now crippled.

The action of the play revolves
around Harold and Taylor's attempt
to save themselves while coming to
terms with their mortality.

Harold is a mild~mannered physi-
cist who has a wife and a child and is
relatively happy with life. Taylor, on
the other hand. is a district attorne

” KEEPIN’ MY LOVER SATISFIED

who is constantly at ”war” with
something. He hates the people he
prosecutes, women in general and
most people with whom he comes in
contact. He seems to be basically
unhappy with life.

Patrick Meyers’ well—written script
revolves around the theme that one
should hope for a positive outcome
but accept whatever happens. Harold
believes this theme and abides by it;
he doesn't let his fear of death stop
him from living, and, at the end of the
play, he actually dies with gratitude.

Taylor is very unlike Harold in this
and many other ways. Taylor has a
defeatist attitude about surviving
and actually breaks down because he
is very frightened of death. He's had
this fear of death throughout his life,
and this fear has stopped him from
living. He is afraid to put his trust in
people because he doesn't want to get
hurt, and, in essence, he actually kills
himself before he dies.

Director Larry Arrick successfully
meets the challenge that the under-
taking of the play presents. His stag-
ing is very natural, and he has the
actors use the small acting area to
their advantage.

Don Howard lends an air of credi-
bility to his role as the injured Harold
— a particularly difficult job because

he has to perform the entire play
while sitting.

James Harper was especially good
as the domineering Taylor. He did
some apparently dangerous climbing
and made it appear that he really was
an experienced mountain climber.
(Credit for this should probably go to
Bruce McClellan, who was the climb—
ing and technical adviser of the
show.)

Big bun, but where’re the poll results? Where're the poll results? I
don't think there's anyone back there.;..Now hold on, all you fillies
and foals, Uncle Roy has all the answers you're looking for, and
because you submitted them, they're even more special....

The results of the Third Annual 1983 SHOWCASE Music Poll are
in, and like most of our reading audience, they're bizarre. The word
for this year was diversity, as you guys submitted an incredible array
of bands ranging from Jah Wobble to Stevie Ray Vaughan to (gag)
Journey. Consequently, there were no runaway winners and, in some
cases, first, second and third place were decided by a matter of one or
two votes.

As expected, the big winners were the Police, Michael Jackson and
David Bowie, which seems to reflect the national opinion of who was
hot in 1983. Michael Jackson even took honors for Worst Album,
which only goes to show that he wins everything.

Oh, and thank you for all the bizarre comments you took the time
to dream up; we especially liked the dirty ones. You'll find that we've
included some of the more original entries on the following pages.
Remember though, this is not a contest, so please, no wagering!

BEAUTY STAB
ABC
Mercury Records

One need look no farther
than England's ABC to prove
that success in thefickle world
of pop music is just as difficult to
maintain as it is to achieve in the
first place.

Authors of one of the truly
magnificent surprises of 1982,
the infectious Lexicon Of Love,
ABC's King Midas touch has
more than worn down on their
new album Beauty Stab; it's nearly
vanished. The once golden
touch of gifted lead singer Mar-
tin Fry and band mates Mark
White and Stephen Singleton is
found drowning here in various
combinations of obscure lyrics,
careless arrangements and
uncomfortable sound through-
out.

The album's first single,
"That Was Then, But This is
Now,” seems, in fact, to speak
more to the band's present
dilemma with its musical iden-
tity than to the political Cold

WHAT IS BEAT?
English Beat
IRS

What Is Beat? the fourth, and
presumably, final offering from
the original members of the
English Beat is a striking
glimpse at a band whose prom-
ise had just begun to reach these
shores.

What Is Beat? is the perfect
short story lifted from the novel
that was the English Beat. The
13 songs collected here make for
a somewhat uneven package,
with nearly half taken from the
band's first album, I ]ust Can't
Stop; but that's OK, this band
always did seem to be going in
several different directions at
once.

War to which it vaguely alludes.
Masters of an exciting white
soul that captured the pulse and
imagination of listeners with a
combination of intricate word
play and sophisticated string
arrangements, ABC offers none
of the above on Beauty Stab.
Having dropped the look of
proper gentlemen in favor of.
jeans and leather jackets, ABC
find themselves in a predica-
ment. Fry's rich voice and the
band's once clever lyrics are dis-
placed without the lush settings
of Lexicon. Mark White's guitar
pieces are hack work, while the
arrangements on the slower
numbers are almost apologetic.
"Love is a Dangerous Lan-
guage,” ”King Money” and ”Bite
the Hand" are all examples of
these muddled intentions.
While Beauty Stab is not with-
out its minor victories — such as
uptempo numbers "The Power
of Persuasion" and "Hey Citi-
zen" and the delicate "SOS" ——
far too much of this record is
nonsense. Lyrical passages that
are undecipherable, the com-

While the English Beat have
obviously steered clear of poli-
tics here (though there is plenty
in their background), they
never vary from the emotional
point of view which guides
nearly every song in their rich
catalogue. From start to finish,
these songs are cynical in their
rongantic outlook and believable
in the situations they create.

With the departure of lead ‘

singer Dave Wakeling and his
sidekick Ranking Roger, the
future of the English Beat is in
doubt. Although, the playing
members of the band have
remained intact and have the
material for another studio
release, the loss of Wakeling and
Roger hangs a cloud over the
project.

But, in spite of the difficulties
surrounding this band, What 15

charming and worthwhile col-

most creative vendors of that
rock steady beat.

STRIP
Adam Ant
Epic

"Perfection is so dull,” Adam
Ant claims on a cut from Strip,
his latest album that seems to be
a post-punk anthem to a
straightforward and unabashed
kind of sexuality. Yet the album
is perfect, or very near perfect.
He's clearly not just part of
Adam and the Ants anymore;
Strip is his slickest album yet,
and he gambles with it success-
fully. Well, almost.

It seems blatant to suggest
Adam Ant made this album for
his 14-year-old following, but
handing a 14-year-old a copy of
Strip is like handing her a copy of

creativity.

One can only hope that the
band's next stab will be far more
penetrating.

with Olivia Newton—]ohn). But
with help from Phil Collins and
some of his best vocal work yet,
Strip works nevertheless.

For his 14-year-old fans,
~Ant’s Strip will please a lot of
little hearts. For the rest of us,
it's sort of a harmless reminder
that when stripped "down to its
meaning, sex can still be playful
and fun.

AFTER HOURS
Velveteen
Atlantic

The unlikely team of singer —

Lisa Burns — and bass player —.

Sal Maida —- makes up
Velveteen; six helpings of OK
pop make up their EP, After
Hours. Burns has one of those
"nice" voices; her singing is
skillful and rather soul-less, but
she jumps effortlessly around
the songs. Maida's bass lines
rumble through the material (all
of it written by the duo). Linn
drums provide the beat, and

HEARTLAND
Real Life
MCA

More haircuts, more synthe-
sizers, and they call themselves
Real Life? Things are really
starting to get twisted with all
these one—hit synth—pop bands
running amuck and droning out
any remaining feeling in the
”new music" genre. Real Life
would probably fits right into
that pigeonhole were it not for
the vocalist’s unusual voice,
which falls somewhere between
Robert Plant's and Paul
Young's, and the band's (or pro-
ducer Steve I-Iillage’s) ability to
come up with some really catchy
musical arrangements, espe-
cially on the title track, ”Send
Me An Angel"; the band's latest
single, "Broken Again";
”Always” and ”Burning Blue."

The arrangements manage to
keep an original slant on an oft-
repeated synthesizer style that
is so nauseatingly prominent on
today's charts. Moreover, the
band has a real drummer
instead of one of those compu-
ters that makes everything even
more repetitive (the band failed
to leave their names anywhere
on the album, so the drummer,
like the lead singer, will ha-ve to
remain anonymous.).

However, while it does have
its inspirational moments, Heart
Land is largely an average album
that is ridden with cliche, both
with its lyrical content and its
worn out electronic gimmickry.

UNDER A BLOOD RED SKY
U2 . -
Island
Ask anyone who was at the
Fulton Theatre on May 6, 1983,
and he or she will probably rave
that U2 put on the best concert
of that year. For those lucky
enough to have seen that show,
it is remembered as a night of
passionate music driven by the
Edge’s rip—chord guitar playing
and further inspired by Bono's
quasi—religious showmanship.
For those forced to listen to
superlative-ridden accounts of
this concert, hope is not lost;

Under A Blood Red Sky, U2's eight-

Atures

song live mini-LP (mini?) cap-
the excitement and
intensity of this incredible Irish
band like no other concert
album since Warren Zevon’s
Stand In The Fire.

Under A Blood Red Sky is a well-
conceived package of some of
U2’s best tunes recorded live in
Boston, Denver and West Ger-
many. It includes staples like
”Gloria,” "Sunday Bloody Sun-
day," ’’I Will Follow" and "New
Year's Day," but it also cleverly
contains some of the band's

more thought-provoking pieces

such as ”Party Girl,” "11
O’Clock Tick Tock” (two pre-
viously unreleased songs), ”The
Electric Co.,” and especially, the
gorgeous ”40.” Sadly, the LP
doesn't contain ”Two Hearts
(Beat As One) ”or ”Out Of Con-
trol,” which is the only disap-
pointment this release affords.
The addition of these two cuts

would have more than justified
raising the price to conventional
album levels.

Jimmy .Iovine’s production
and Shelly Yakus’ mixing magic
give Under A ‘Blood Red Sky an.
exceptional sound quality.
Bono’s vocals are crystal clear,
the crowd noise is kept to a min-
imum and the instrument sepa-
ration is excellent, especially on
”Gloria,” which helps make it
the best cut on the LP. A

Quite simply, this album is a
must. It is not often that the
essence of a band as explosive as
U2 is caught on a live recording,
but. Under A Blood Red Sky is
clearly an exception. For those
who saw the Fulton show, this
album will resurrect fond
memories; for those less fortu-
nate, this LP will prove that all
those superlatives were not

_ unfounded.

Fortitude  

No-name Panthers emerging
in time for Seton Hall

By Mark A. Sindler
The Pitt News

' At the time, showing Pitt through
its first Big East season, Pitt head
basketball coach Roy Chipman was
not faring too badly. The time was
February 1983 and the Panthers
were coming off those infamous
‘Fitzgerald Field House upsets.

In fact, Pitt had won five of seven
with Providence and Georgetown
serving as bookends for that impres-
sive streak. That, many will
remember, was the age of‘upsets‘for
Pitt. It almost didn't seem approp-
riate, these slayings of Top 20 con-
ference teams by a Panther squad
getting a feel for first—year member-
ship in the prestigious Big East.

Just the same, Pitt glowed with a
13-10 record and assumed nothing
could block its path. Until Pitt
visited Seton Hall. Crashing to earth
at meteoric speed, the Panthers first
surrendered a 74-68 decision to the
Pirates —- their only conference win.

The Panthers then proceeded to
drop their next four games. All
Chipman was left with was his first
losing season ever. Which brings
Chipman standing before something
very familiar.

Tomorrow, at Madison Square
Garden, Pitt's fourth-year coach
and the Panthers will once again
face Seton Ha.ll at the start of what is
the most important week on the
schedule.

“This a big game for us," Chip-
man remarked. “In fact, it could be
the biggest game of the season for us.
It's very similar to last year. We were
coming offthe win against St. John's
[72-7 1]. Everyone and everything
was really upbeat."

And then he paused. “It's going to
be a tough, tough game. We have to
get ready to play because later on we
face Syracuse and Georgetown
[Wednesday and Saturday home
games]."

From an injury or mood perspec-
tive, the Panthers (l0-4, 1-3) are
primed for the l2:3O p.m. game that
precedes a 3 p.m. matchup featuring
St. John's and Georgetown. For-
ward Clyde Vaughan, canning 22.3
points per game and averaging eight
rebounds per game, will start,
although he has been hindered by a
sore ankle he sprained at Villanova.

It has been Vaughan, prior to
Monday's game, who is looked upon
to amass the scoreboard figures and
pull Pitt from deficits. That

. changed, and for the better, when

Chipman noticed the magnitude ofa
team effort exhibited in that second
half, while Vaughan's exhaustion
and his 38-minute average got the
best of him.

To compensate, forward Chip
Watkins dumped in I0 second-half
points, center Andre Williams six
and George Allen eight. Virtually
nothing fell into disarray with
Vaughan held scoreless. Could that

mean Chipman will rearrange his
game plan? ‘ _

"I don't think it's an indication of
things to come," he answered.
“Clyde got tired in the second half. I
kept asking him if he was tired or
wanted to sit down for awhile. He
kept saying no. It's difficult tojudge
him. He's so damn strong, so you
have to go, by what he says.

“He'll still get his 20-25 points a
game, but I plan to rest him more.
As it worked out at the end [Mon-
day], I'm still kicking myself for
keeping him in there."

When Vaughan is out, taking his T

place will likely be Darryl Shepherd,
a sophomore averaging three points
per game. Chipman will also rotate
Keith Armstrong, still a starter, and
Williams at center. As of late, it
would be detrimental to keep Willi-
ams and the l2.5 points scored in his
last three games off the floor.

“Andre is enjoying coming off the
bench,” Chipman said. “He needs
that to get into the game and get a
feel for what's going on. He can see
what's going on and get adjusted,
ready to play.

“Andre couldn't get onto the floor
early. He's a very smart player. He
likes to see what the offense is doing;
he's very observant."

Nothing, Chipman further added,
will be spared in strategy when Pitt
meets Seton Hall Saturday. Embar-
rassments like last year's loss will not

be taken lightly.

The Pitt News

The Panther swimming and~div-
ing teams are gearing up for Satur-
day's swim meets against two state
rivals. The men's team will go up
against La Salle, who beat them in
their last meeting, while the girl's
team will take on the four-time Div-
ision ll champs from Clarion.

World record holder and head
diving coach Julian Krug says the
team did some of the best diving of
their lives against Penn State last
week and feels confident of a victory
this weekend. '

Despite losing his number one
men's diver, Mark McCormick, in
an accident Wednesday, Krug»
believes the men's team should still
be highly competitive against La
Salle. “We'll be~in great shape for
this weekend. We have plenty ofable
back-ups," Krug said. Krug cited
Chris Blair as a key factor in the
Panther victory on Saturday. Blair
received high honors in the Pa. State
Diving meet during his senior year
of high school and was trained at the
Pitt Aquatic Club.

Except for McCormick, most of
the Pitt diving team is made up of
unrecruited members. “The number
of walk-ons speaks for the whole

teams dedication. Last year we
pretty well dominated La Salle all
day, and that's something in our
favor, but they've improved a lot.
It's going to be a tough meet.”

The girl's diving team is coming
off a fine performance last week
against Penn State, but will certainly
have their work cut out for them in
their Saturday match-up against
Clarion. Pitt diver Jennifer Brown
will be pitted against at least one of
Clarion's three All-America divers.
“They've got this one girl up there
that's really superior and I respect
her, but 1 don't think she's untouch-
able," Brown said.

Pitt's diving team has gained a lot
of repect after their performance last
week and hopes to draw on the home
crowd advantage for this weekend's
meet as well. “We've never really
been taken seriously before," said
Brown, “but after beating some
really good teams at Penn State,
now they're beginning to be afraid of‘
coming here."

In the men's swimming events, the
Panthers hope to extend their win-
ning streak and prepare for the East-
ern swim meets later in the year. Pitt
men's swim coach Fred Lewis says
that Pitt can expect outstanding per-
formances from Ed Bergan and Ed
Bahan, yet said a full team effort
would be necessary for a victory.

Pitt went into last week's meet
ranked l5th, and after beating No. l
ranked Penn State were moved up to
No. 9. “As far as I'm concerned
they're just a paper lion,"said Lewis.
“On paper they may beat us, but in
the water it's another thing."

This weekend's meets, will be held
in Trees Hall. The men's meet starts

Pitt’s Jack Uppling suffered his third defeat in nine matches, as Cleveland’s

Darryl Render beat him.

Pitt grapplers below .500

By Tim Dinger
The Pitt News

CLEVELAND v The Panther
wrestling team had its record pushed
below the .500 mark Wednesday
evening by Eastern Wrestling
League (EWL) powerhouse Cleve-
land State 40-6 at Cleveland.

The Panthers could only manage
a pair ofdecisions and gave up three
pins and three superior decisions to
the now 5-2 Vikings.

“The way we wrestled the
matches, I can’t believe the final
score difference,” said head coach
Rande Stottlemyer. “The one thing

that really hurt us was the three pins. »

There’s no excuse for getting pinned.
I understand that it happens every
once in a while, but we seem to
expect it.”

The three pins came in the final
matches of the evening, starting at
177 lbs.’ when Panther Durt Joseph
(5-5) fell to Cleveland’s two-time
Eastern Wrestling League champion

Matt Duka (I3-I), withjust under a
minute left in the match.

At 190 lbs., Panther Jack Uppling
(5-3-l)jumped offto a 6-0 lead in the
first period but was thrown to his
back in the second period by CSU’s
Darryl Render (2-3).

With 26 seconds remaining in the
match, heavyweight Matt Ghaffari
(I2-3) of Cleveland put Panther Dan
Kasperkoski (I-5)—to his back to end
the contest.

“Sometimes your only contribu-
tion to the team is not to get pinned,"
Stottlemyer said. “We're not doing
that, but we’re going to start work-
ing on that right now.’

After the Vikings won the first five
matches, Panther Sherm Moyer (4-
6) finally got Pitt on the board with a
8-6 victory over CSU’s Ricky Cole at
158 lbs.

Pitt co-captain Jeff Jelic (I7-2)
made it two in a row with an easy
10-5 win over Viking Bill Whitehair.

“Most kids are just content to
keep the score close when they wres-
tle Jeff,” said Stottlemyer. “That’s
what [Whitehair] was doing.

“Jeff wrestled a good match, but
he gets frustrated when he‘s not kil-
ling somebody. He‘s got to learn to
relax.”

The match started with CSU’s
John Velimesis (6-4) downing
Panther Hal Bolin (2-2) 25-6 at 118
lbs.

At 126 lbs.,two-time EWL Cham-
pion Dan Foldesy of Cleveland out-
pointed Pitt’s Kyle Nellis (18-5)
20-5. At 134 lbs., Panther John
Hnath gave up two penalty points
for illegally locking hands to fall
behind Viking Dave Budnar 4-3.

Hnath replaced the ill Joe
Throckmorton for the match, and
he may retain the starting spot due
to Throckmorton’s decision to move
up to I42 lbs. Viking Bob Richards
shut down Pitt’s Gary Bolin I6-6.
while Viking Steve Babyak slashed
through Panther Greg Dille 25-8 at
150 lbs.

The Panthers are now 3-4 overall
and 1-2 in EWL competition. Pitt’s
next wrestling action will be this
Sunday, when the Panthers travel to
Bloomsburg State for their fourth
straight EWL contest.

Kodak meet attracts runners

The Lady ‘Panther track team

travels this weekend to Eastern-

Tennessee to participate in the
Eastman Kodak Invitational.

This is the first year the girls
will compete at Eastern Tennes-
see. Runners traveling to the
meet will be Renee Henderson,
Edith Butler and Felicia Blake.
They will all be running their
usual events with the exception
of the 400- and 200- meter relays.
In a meet of this caliber, if the
talent is there, it will be
discovered.

“If I want to know where my
runners really are, I'll have to put
them in and see how they sur-
vive," coach Elbert ‘Kennedy

.said. Kennedy is expecting good

efforts from all three of his
runners.

Among the schools that will
run are Alabama, Tennessee
State, Florida and Kentucky, to

mention a few.

One of the highly-regarded
competitors is sprinter Chanda
Chesseborogh, who runs for
Athletics West ‘track club. At this
point, there is limited informa-
tion on other outstanding
competitors.

Both freshmen Butler and
Blake feel that with more meets
and more experience, their per-
formances will improve. This
meet will introduce them to high
caliber teams, which might help
them gain experience.

“In order to be good, you have
to run against the better people,”
Kennedy said. He added that
“it's easier to qualify in larger
tracks,” and he’s hoping for the
best.

Good performances this week-
end could provide the impetus
for much greater improvement in
the future.

Roger Kingdom

By Charlie O'Hara
The Pitt News

Tonight on/the campus of Eastern
Tennessee State University, the
Panther track team competes in the
prestigious Eastman Kodak
Invitational.

“This is the type of meet that we
can qualify for nationals at,” Pitt
coach John Vasvary said. “lt’s a very
fast track down there, one of the
fastest in the country. So, we’re
expecting to see some good times."

The I983 edition ofthe classic was
where Roger Kingdom first showed
his world-class hurdling ablillty. In
the quarter-final qualifying heat,
Kingdom was clocked at 7.21, but in
the semi-final heat, he experienced a
collision with the contestant next to
him. Although Willie Gault, then of
Tennessee, won the competition, the
name Kingdom stuck as Kingdom
went on to great success outdoors.

Kingdom leads contingent to
Kodak invite — E. Tenn.

Kingdom will again run his spe-
cialty, the 55—meter hurdles. He may
also compete in the high jump. He
proved a week ago that he is near top
form as he easily disposed of Charles
Foster, a I976 Olympian, and Reg-
gie Towns, the I983 runner-up to
Kingdom in the national champion-
ship ll0-meter hurdles.

There is a significantly fewer
number of athletes expected to chal-
lenge Pitt this weekend due to the
high demand of the meet as well as
the high level of competitors.

“It's like a preview to the national
championships," Vasvary said.
“Everybody from the South Eastern
conference and the Big l0 and a lot
of the Big East schools will be there.
Plus, all the club teams come. This is
a biggie.”

Other short sprinters entered for
Pitt are Gerard Battle and Joe
McCall. Shane Saunders was to per-
form, but he suffered a muscle tear
from his calf all the way through his
hamstring.

The Pitt Program Council is now accepting
applications for Chairperson positions. for the

1984-1985 school year.

You are invited to apply for one of the 14 available positions. The deadline for
application is Monday, January 23 at 5:00 pm.

Todd Colas

In the middle distance events,
Todd Colas heads the Panther list.

Colas is fresh off of last week‘s
record—setting performance at North
Carolina, where he was named the
outstanding distance runnerfor Pitt.

He is scheduled for the 1000-
meter run. Senior Bill Moorhead
will team with Colas in the I000-
meters.

Garland Brown and freshman
Tim Manes will combine in the 800-
meter run, while freshmen Jesse
Mikel] and Alan Laws will run the
400-meter dash.

Pitt’s distance medley relay team.
consisting of Laws, Colas, Moor-
head and Brown, will run in the invi-
tational level competition.

In the field events, aside from
Kingdom in the high jump. fresh-
men Jim Johnson and Bill Lance
will pole vault, while senior Ralph
Mitton will triple jump.

The meet can do one oftwo things
for the Pitt team since the season is
so young. Confidence, or a lack the-
reof, will be the result.

By Bob Green
The Pitt News

The Panther gymnastics team
opens its regular season today at the
Shenandoah Invitational on the
campus of James Madison
University. .

“The team is pretty much in top
form,” assistant coach Joe Femiani
said. “If we stay healthy we should
win.”

Pitt’s strong events are the floor
exercise, horizontal bar, and vault.
“In these three events we can com-
pete with anyone in the nation,"
Femiani said. “On the pommel
horse, the still rings and the parallel
bars we lack depth. But we are still
competitive on them.”

Frank Kratz, a senior at Pitt, nar-
rowly missed qualifying for the
NCAA National Championship in
I983, but returns to perform in the
all-around competition.

“We have some butterflies,” Kratz
said. “NC. State and Navy will be
tough competition. We're not in top
shape, but we are in good shape.
Since this is our first meet, it can go‘
either way. We should do well in the
competition.”

Anothe_r senior, Dave Smith, who
is a three-time NCAA qualifier,_ is
back for a fourth try at gaining All-
America status.

“Injuries will not be a factor in the
meet,“ he said. ‘‘I‘m not worried
because of my experience, but the
other [guys] may be a little shaky."

Matt Peters, a sophomore whom
head coach Frank D’Amico consid-
ers his most versatile athlete, also
commented, “Over the month layoff

»from our last meet, we have played it
safe at practice by not trying to do
any touch moves. We should finish
in the top two places."

Sophomore Mark Klafter, who
established a new Pitt all-around
mark as a freshman, returns despite
an injury. “I'm confident about the
meet, [although] I’m not at my full
potential because of an injury
[sprained right c1avicaI],“ he said.

Some of the other teams compet-
ing against Pitt will be Georgia, N.C.
State, Navy and William & Mary.

Although the Panthers are confi-
dent, they still consider the competi-
tion with respect.

Panthers
8 Pirates

continued from page seventeen

Already the Pirates have shown
signs of promise, though their 7-9,
1-5 record shines away from that.
Two nights ago Villanova pounded
Seton Hall 84-67 in Philadelphia.
The score, though, strayed from tell-
ing the honest story.

“I was watching the game on USA
[Cable Network] and with four min-
utes left, Seton Hall was behind
three points." Chipman said. “This
teams for real. They brought in four
transfers and [coach P.J.] Carlesimo
had at least IO people coming in and
out.”

Carlesimo whipped up a rapid 5-0
start for the Pirates before confer-
ence play began. The ravages oftime
have since set in, though the Pirates
don’t surrender losing scores with-
out temporarily blindfolding oppos-
ing teams.

One leading Seton Hall scorer is
Andre McCloud, a 6-6 forward who
was named to the Big East's all-
rookie squad in I983. The sopho-
more‘s l3.2 ppg are third to the 20.0
ppg produced by 6-6 senior forward
Tom Brown.

Chipman doesn't care what he
hears about Seton Hall, though. For
all he knows, this could be unde-
feated North Carolina that the
Panthers will face. He only hopes
the Panthers understand that.

“There’s always a chance for a let-
down,” Chipman said. “It's some-
thing a good team guards against.
It’s silly since we’re_j I-3. We're still on
a downslide. By Saturday, I hope
we’ll have had ample time to make
up for that." =

Check

out this

weekend

The horrid driving conditions are
expected to improve this weekend,
just in time for students and faculty
to make the most of a fun-filled
break from the books.

The Pittsburgh Savoyards are
featuring a centennial production of
Gilbert and Sullivan's musical
comedy “Princess Ida” at Stephen
Foster Memorial Theatre on Friday
night and Saturday afternoon and
evening.

Cornwell Owesny and Amy

Schmertz star as Florian and "

Melissa, respectively. Owesny is a
student at Churchill High School,
while Amy attends Peabody High.

“Marathon Man," starring Dus-
tin Hoffman and Sir Lawrence Oliv-
ier, will be shown in the television
room of William Pitt Union on Fri-
day at 4 p.m. That video will be the
last of a week of showings.

Be sure to catch “Trading Places,”
the hilarious comedy featuring
Eddie Murphy and Dan Aykyoyd,
at David Lawrence Auditorium this
weekend. This tale of altered identi-
ties truly tests the heredity vs. envir-
onment argument that psychologists

 

have debated for years. The price is
right; admission is just $1 for stu-
dents with validated I.D.

The Pittsburgh Playhouse offers
three features this weekend. “The
Hunger,” a British film with Cathe-
rine Deneuve, David Bowie and
Susan Sarandon, will be shown
tonight at 7:30, 9:30 and ll:30 p.m.
“Fanny and Alexander," directed by
Ingmar Bergman, will be featured
for only a 7:30 p.m. screening on
Saturday. An older ﬁlm “Cheaper
By The Dozen," which was filmed in
I950, will be shown Sunday at 7:30
and 9:40 p.m.

'0  

   
  

Again, the price is suited to a stu-
dents budget. Admission is always
$2.75 at The Playhouse, located on
Craft Avenue. :

Professional wrestling returns to
the Civic Arena this evening at 8
p.m. An all-star is planned, so be
sure to get there early.

Pittsburgh Film-Makers on (lik-
land Avenue offers three features
this weekend as well. Friday night's
film, “Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai Du
Commerce — I080 Bruxelles," will

be shown in the William Pitt Union _
Multi-Purpose Room tonight at 8

p.m.

Saturday night, the Film-Makers
presents “Born in Flames." On Sun-
day, the feature is “Autumn
Leaves."

And, of course, for all those foot-
ball fanatics out there, Super Bowl
XVIII will get underway Sunday at 4
p.m. on CBS and be carried locally
on Channel 2. The Washington
Redskins and Los Angeles Raiders
clash for the National Football
League title. The game can be
watched on a seven-foot screen at
Corky’s on Fifth Avenue.

The Pitt News, Friday, January 20, 1984

By Charlie O'Hara
The Pitt News

Cautious optimism could best
decribe the feeling that the Lady
Panther gymnastics team is
“experiencing entering Saturday‘s
Pitt-Michigan State matchup at

East Lansing, Mich.

Despite carrying a (2-0) record
into the meet, Pitt coach Donna
Sanft is not about to underrate
the opposition.

x . 

beam routine.

“Michigan State —— they’re
good,” she said. “They’re top two
team scores are I74 and 176.
They are from a different region
than us, so we don’t know how
good they are. Wejust have to go
in looking for a good meet.”

Pitt's highest team total ever is
I7 I, set last week in their victory
over Slippery Rock.

“Two years ago, they embar-
rassed us pretty bad," senior
Karen Martin said.v“So, I’m kind
of looking at this meet with a
little revenge in mind."

Wendy lsaacman/ The Pitt News
Freshman Kelli Coleman practices her balance

Lady Panther gymnasts to
face first road test at MSU

Two Lady Panthers are pres-
ently dealing with more—than-
trivial injuries. Sophomore
Debbie Dabkowski and fresh-
man Alisa Spector are hampered
by ankle injuries. Dabkowski has
a bad sprain, while Spector has a
bone spur problem. Both injuries‘
are caused by landing short on
vault and floor exercise routines.

.\ “I don’t think it will affect
them a whole lot,” assistant
coach Frank Klein said. “We
have Babbie Flock coming back.
Who knows, we may end out
even stronger.”

For Lisa Shirk, the Lady
Panthers’ number-one per-
former, the meet is just another
challenge to better her routines.

“In practice, I work on putting
myself in meet situations," she
said. “I work up to my final rou-
tine in practice as if it were a
meet. That way I can get men-
tally prepared.”

Thus far, since returning to the
team after a two year battle with
ankle injuries, Shirk has cer-
tainly been prepared. She has
won each event in both of the
first two meets except the bal-
ance beam in the New Hamp-
shire meet on Jan. 7.

“Away meets are always a bit
ofa transition,”she said, “Equip-
ment is not standard. It’s difficult
to adjust to different equipment.
In fact, I end up spending much
of my time adjusting to the
equipment."

The team has proven early that
they can win. It’s a matter of
whether they gain consistency,
something they lacked in I983.

Pitt-Georgetown

Student tickets for the Pitt-Georgetown game,
Jan. 28, will be available Monday at the Stu-
dent Union ticket office.
