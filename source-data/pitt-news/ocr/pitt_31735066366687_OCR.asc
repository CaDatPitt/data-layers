Ugly Man Contest
Voting Begins Today;
Dance , On Saturday

Voting for service fraternity Alpha Phi Omega’s, an-
nual Ugly Man on Campus (MOC) charity contest begins
today and will continue until Saturday at 3 p.m. The results
of the contest will be announced at a dance Saturday from
9 to 12 p.m. in the Student Union Ballroom. Admission is 35
cents stag or 50 cents a couple.

Students may indicate their
aesthetic preferences by casting
votes at a penny a vote at the
display boards in the Student
Union, Towers Lobby and the
ground ﬂoor of the Cathedral.
Daily standings of the contestants
will be posted.

The winner is determined on,

the basis of the total amount of
money he receives and on the
originality and overall appear-
ance of the contestant as deter-
mined by a panel of judges. The
judges are Parker Emwright, as-
sistant dean of men; J. Robert
Loch, Student Union director; and
Steven Risen, local radio station,
KQV, and WIIC-TV personality.

“The fraternity sponsors the
contest as a means of raising
money for worthwhile charities,”
said Robert E. Boylan, Jr., chair-
man of the event. Last year the
contest and the dance netted ap-
proximately $500. The money
was donated to the _Western
Pennsylvania Psychiatric Hospi-
tal to be used for mental research
and to the Foster Parents Plan
to support a foster child in Ecua-
dor.

Part of the money from this
year’s contest will again go to
the Foster Parents Plangwith the
remainder going to the Men’s
Emergency Loan Fund. None of
-the proceeds are kept by the fra-
ternity. - *

Alpha Phi Omega is a national
honorary service fraternity asso-

ciated with the Boy Scouts of ,

vide service to its campus, com-
munity and nation.”

Judicial Board MDC Goal;
Study Committee Appointed

Men’s Dormitory Council (MDC)
passed a bill creating a ﬁve-mem-
ber committee to lay the ground
work in establishing a judicial
board at its Wednesday meeting.

The purpose of the bill is to
give “dorm students greater con-
trol in the affairs,” said Harvey
Lefton, MDC president. “The
group will not be impotent,” he
said. “It will have the power to
make decisions.”

All matters of social rules ‘or:
dorm rules violations would be

passed on by the proposed board.’

Lefton has discussed the pro-
posal with Dean of Men Herbert

McGibbeny and said that the dean A

agreed with it. Any power given
to the board, Lefton emphasized,
would have to be used in a rea-
sonable manner since “all deci-
sions are subject to review
higher authorities.”

by.

lnsto Leftoll.

  

The committee is presently in-
vestigating the structure and
workings of similar boards at
other colleges and universities.
.On the basis of this information
it hopes to be able to draw up a
reasonable and working proposal
for the Towers. Members of the
board would be chosen from the
dormitory residents and would
be composed entirely of students.
Criterai for selection of these
members will be worked out by
the committee.

In other action, the council is
developing a. proposal for changes
in the dormitory social regula-
tions. MDC hopes to obtain vis-
iting hours for female guests in
the Towers every’ Friday and
Saturday evening. Action on this
proposal is “pending.” accord-

Dope Charge
Hits Nine
At Penn State

Local and State police raided
private homes and apartment
buildings at State College last
Wednesday and arrested nine
Penn State University students
on narcotics chargesf

John R. Juba, State College po-
lice chief, said the raid followed
an investigation over the. “past
several months on our knowledge
of narcotics being used here.”

Chief Juba said the raid of six
separate private homes and apart-
ments ‘where the students lived
proved one-half to one pound of
marijuana.

Chief Juba said his depart-
ment, the university’s security
force, and the State Police were
aware of the “widespread use of
narcotics, particularly among stu-
dents here” since the initial ar-
rests.

   

   

facing court-marshal, and a seri-
ous case of poison ‘ivy on his
“seat.”

The drawings in Ideas\ and Fig-
ures are interesting and produce
art which varies from the grotes-
que subjects, but ﬂowing, ornate
lines of Vey to the soft wash por-
traits of Willa Appel (and all the
others in between).

Another portion of Ideas and
Figures is devoted to a review,
“Existential Thought in” Breath-
less,” by Stu Cohen, a tightly
written sophisticated account of
existential characteristics of the
movie.

The poems of/ Ideas and Fig- I
ures cover quite at range of sub-.'
ject matter. This includes a Cum-‘

mins’ style nature and love poem
by Klein, Federman’s poem ﬁll-
ed with paradoxes and impera-
tives, and Mike Tinker’s poem
“Requium,” commenting on the
self-destruction of mankind.

__If' you are on the basket-

ophy towards basketball.
The only time the philosophy
as broken was when there
was a team good enough to
get an NIT and NCAA bid

g the judicial system would be the
appointment of one dorm counselor to each judicial board. This provision
would make the “all decisions subject to" review by higher authorities”

__ clause implicit in each board’s deliberations. The dorm counselor would
represent the administrative strata, obtaining personal information on
those involved and noting if the case had ramiﬁcations in other areas
of the University community. ‘

A similar system should also be designed for the Women’s dormitor-

ies. Students, whether male or female, are capable of judging rule {infrac-
tions within their own living areas. It is their obligation to learn to -live
within the legal limits of their community and deal with those who violate
the laws. Similar situations will occur in adult life and now, not then, is
the time to, learn. ‘ I
4 Such a proposal for‘a judicial system would place authority in the
hands of students, while providing a safeguard against any student defi-
ciencies in judicial knowledge. The MDC committee should-not fear de-

F signing such a proposal and the Office of Student Affairs should not fear
approving a well-formulated program with these outlines.

THE ATHLETES ARE LONELY

I am beginning to wonder why they call the Fitzgerald
»:,Field House part of the University of Pittsburgh. No Pitt
students ever go there. '

. One of the top teams in the East, Temple, played at the
{Field lHouse this past Saturday and only 517 fans came.
‘This includes four members of the Pitt News, two represen-
tatives from the local papers, four members of WPGH, most
embers of the athletic department, interested alumni, par-
ts’ and friends of the players and even a couple of the
squash players who happened to be using the courts up-
stairs. One thing about a Pitt basketball game everybody
_says “hello” to everyone thererat least once.

Pitt has to be one of the few teams in the country that
"doesn’t have a home court advantage, and they need one. A
75-13 record isn’t going to bring ardent basketball fans in
'.._from Wilmerdingior Beltzhoover, but Towers A, B and C
aren’t very far at all.

    
 
  
     
 
 
  
   
   
   
    
   
   
 
 
    
  
   
 
  

, ent crowd of over 3000 fans came to see the game. Too bad,
_ninety per cent of them were Mountaineer fans. Against
;St. Johns, another Eastern powerhouse, a measely 617 peo-
f_pl_e came to watch. pg
 What’s the matter with the Pitt student. Their basket-
ball team isn’t very good, but might have won a couple of
these games if they had an intangible which wins many
asketball games, student support. '

Student support doesn’t grab key rebounds or make
crucial shots, but it can help the players get a little more
"worked up for a game. Ara Parseghian could put “pride”
signs on his players girl-friends and it wouldn’t key them
up unless the fans supported them. ‘
_' Carnegie Tech has a fair team for the first time in
many years yet they still weren’t of the same calibre as
.:_the Panthers. They were even less mediocre, but they al-
most ‘won. They had 2000 students packed into their tiny
gym. There couldn't have been more than thirty or forty
students from Pitt attending, including the team.

_ ERESHMEN ARE‘WIN»NE'RS

_ Tim Grgurich and the freshmen have been working
:*«-..very: hard to «put ‘together a frosh hoop team that can be
m called representative. They_ have beaten the St. Bonaven-
ture, Duquesne and West Virginia freshmen quintets. They
beat Duquesne only on guts.

They were smaller and not as strong as the little Dukes
and took a physical beating under the boards. They had td
listen to obnoxious calls from the stands that are so typical
of Duquesne basketball fans. It was the most exciting game

. of the season an only a handful of Panther rooters were at
the game.

It’s not only true of basketball but every winter sport.
There are only three home wrestling meets this year ' and
a high estimate of about 100 people came to watch the, Cor.-

_ nell match. Not many more came to see the nation's best
, gymnastics team, Penn State, who had performed before
a home crowd of 7600 a week before.

Outlast Falenski, Szykowny, 7 1 -64

Defeating the West Vir-
ginia basketball team" in
Morgantown just isn’t done,
at least not by teams whc
aren’t national powers. In
fact that’s the way it is on
most home courts, the host
usually wins, regardless of

comparatative strength.

The Mountaineers are 10-0 in
West Virginia, 7-0 in Morgan-
town. Included in the wins are
victories over Duke and St. J ohn’s,
who are national powers. But

_once WVU leaves their happy

winning grounds they no longer X
look like a basketball team that

sports a 15-7 record.

They were clobbered by a me-
diocre NYU squad. They were
nipped by an even more medicore

Richmond ﬁve. Last Saturday, the

Mountaineers were walloped by
Maryland, 107-92, at Maryland,
of course.’

This college basketball axiom,
that the home teams win most of
the time is due to hometown of-
ﬁcials and enthusiastic support-
ers in- the stand.

West Virginia has both of these
elements. They have the officials
and they have the fans, 6,500 of

test.’ They'll have 6,500 there to-

night when the Panther basket-
ball team trys to improve on its
5-13 record. _

Temple was here last Saturday
and only 517 people saw the
cagers almost upset a 17-5 club
that’s probably going to the NIT.
Those 517 found it easy and even
fun near the end of the game to
root as the Panthers closed a 14
point Temple margin to six, and
threatened to come even closer.

Those 517 fans -saw Larry
Szykowny and Stan Falenski push
and scrap against a bigger and
better team to try to pull off the
upset. They saw a Panthef team
that had lost its two starting for-
wards through injuries try to
pull off the upset, only to lose,
71-64. ‘

If Bob Lovett had played, who
knows, they might have succeed-
ed. Temple coach Harry Litwack
had respect for the Panthers,
even without Lovett. He played
his ﬁve starters and no one else.

He played ﬁve men who hadn’t
had more than three hours sleep
the night before because of a
grounded airplane ﬂight. He play-
ed them the whole game.

Szykowny had 21 points and’
10 rebounds for the Panthers as
he was all over the court. Play-
ing forward for the ﬁrst time in
college, Falenski scored 11, all

in the second half. Pete Smith,
who started in the backcourt be-
cause Falenski tmoved up front,
contributed 12 points.

_ Clarence Brookins was the Owl \

the Panthers couldn’t stop. He
consistently hit the key basket
when Temple needed it. With
nine of 13 from the ﬂoor, Brook-
ins had 27 points.

Seven of his points came in a
13-2 Temple surge that‘ lifted
them from a I7-15»lead to 30-17
advantage during the ﬁrst half.
Four clutch points came after the

/ Panthers had narrowed the Owl
' margin to six and when a couple.

of missed layups could have even-
ed the score.

Temple had the same advan-
tage the Panthers had earlier in
the week against Carnegie Tech.

, They were one and one on the

foul line with eight minutes “left
in the game. It helped, because
Temple’s last eight points were
free throws. '

Both teams used the full court
press extensively during the
game. “Our press worked well,'’
said coach Bob Timmons. “We
kept them outside and away from
thebasket where their big men
could hurt, while their press did-
n’t affect us.”

Dino Boni’s Magnetism Remains
W'restling’s Only Drawing Card 

By TOM SACKS, Assistant Sports Editor

Back in the days of fun and games in junior high school, a magnet and its strange '
powers was ‘always a center of attraction. Wrestling artist Dino Boni must have swallowed

one of those magnets as a prank, because
attraction on those around jhini.

His magnetism isn’t  to
coarse bits of iron filings.’ His
power draws hunks of spirit and
enthusiasm from all over, the
ﬁeld house. This "is _, an extraor-
dinary. feat considering the
scarcity of such emotions among
the student body. V‘

The wrestling program this
year is at its lowest ebb since the
arrival of Rex Perry at this Uni-
versity 15 years ago. When Boni
was recruited Perry’s wrestlers
were the top power in the East.
The record four years later is 1-5.

Rookie coach Dave Johnson
wants to see wrestling revital-
ized, but is resigned to the fact
that nothing in that order is go-
ing to happen this year. When
Frank Carver made up this year’
schedule, only three out of nine‘
matches were slated as home
meets. W

Boni remains the only person
who refuses to give up hope for
this year’s team, but even he is
tiring. -A senior and ‘defending
Eastern champion, Dino is about
the only ace sophomore studded
wrestlers are holding.

“Three quarters of wrestling is
mental,” says Boni. “The rest is
skill andconditioning. If you’re
in shape you can push your op-
ponent all over the mat, but if
you’re not up for the match you
don’t stand a chance.

_“I guess after eight years of
pushing I'm getting tired. There’s
nothing to gain if I win, it’s sim-
ply a matter of pride. It’s hard
to get up for a. match when there's
no spirit pushing you.”

Dino is blunt when it comes to
analyzing the team’s poor show-

Feels wrestling forgotten.

the money he has and that hasn't

“They pay us when we wres-

anymore.” » 4

Although wrestling is down in
the dumps now, Boni, like John-
son is conﬁdent of the future. He
has‘ conﬁdence in Johnson and
to him that’s the. best a coach
can hope for. “Wrestling know-
how helps, but personality is the
best weapon a coach can have
going for him,” said Boni-

Navy Runs Away

From Trackmen \

There’ are several good
reasons why the track team
lost their meet with Navy

/r

eversince his presence has had that same strange I

Saturday by 91-18 score. One run-‘ ’

ner, referring to their arena,
said, “If we could practice two
weeks in a setup like this, we’d
be great." .

But Fitzgerald Field House does-
n’t have a fast dirt track or a

suitable place to practice the

weight events or even a broad
jumping pit whereka boy“ can
jump without fear of smashing
his head on a steel beam. The
Annapolis ﬁeld house, however,
has all these facilities and more.

Another reason is that the Mid-
dies have nearly twice as many
athletes on their team as the
Panthers. This difference in depth

"means that the Navy coach has



fresh runners‘ for every event,

while coach Rees must use one
boy for two or three events a day.

This doubling-up was most ap-

Darent in the. two mile relay. -~

Four fresh Navy runners, set a
new field house record beating a
team of / Handelman, Higgins,
Hubner and Hinchberger. Hub-

. net and Hinchberger had previ-

0“SlY run a mile and 1,000 yard
race. respectively.

Dave Sallach’s winning high
jump of six -feet. saved an other-
wise totally winless day for the
Panthers. Injured Luddy Hay-
den managed a third place, in the
broad Jump and Dick_ Crout and

Gymnastics Team
, Defeated by N any
159.15 - 141.10 A

Last year's gymnast vic-
tory over Navy mid’- way
through the season .was the
key to coach Warren Neiger’s
most successful tour in years.
The gym team has reverted back
to its old ways this year with
Navy being no exception, losing
159.15-141.10 at Annapolis Sat-
urday. . \

Dave McKinnis provided his
usual one man heroics, capturing
two ﬁrst places. One came on the
ﬂoor exercises and the other ‘was
on his specialty, the still rings.

He also notched up the second
spot on the side horse. His efforts-
were counteracted, however, by
Navy’s Norm Pettus. Pettus walk-
ed away with two ﬁrst on the

A long horse and parallel bars
while placing third and fourth on

.the still rings and side horse,

   

respectively.

Jim Sacco placed’, in six of the
seven events, including seconds
in the ﬂoor exercises and still
rings. The gym record is now 2-6.

for the unimpressed West Vir-
gina freshmen tonight.

“We may not even. show up for
the game,” joked Tim Grgurich,,
whose Cubs won their eighth
straight Saturday over Johns-
town, 77-47, “after what their
coach said about us after the last
game.”

What WVU frosh coach George
Krajack said was that he was not
at all impressed with the Panther
freshmen after all he had heard
and that ‘‘we’ll be ready for them
when they come down here.”

The Cubs, 11-2, won the ﬁrst
match-I111, 87-75. at the Field
House Jan.'25. Things could be a
\_ lot rougher breaks-wise at hostile
Morgantown. The Little Moun-
taineers, featuring high scoring
guard Wayne Grimm (20.5 points
a game). have won both their
games since the last meeting,
running their record to 7-2.

Coach Grgurich, detained at a
Marine reserve meeting, wasn't
even around for most of Satur-
day’s Johnstown game, but he ar-
rived in time to see the Cubs’

We Are An Equal Opportunity Employer

#1

College graduates, new to Ford Motor Company,
often comment on the comparative youth of many
of our top executives. The example of these men
in key positions is evidence that being young is no
handicap at Ford to those who possess ability and
ambition. In fact, new employes can expect
challenging assignments while still participating
in our College Graduate Program. This means an
opportunity to demonstrate special skills and
initiative while still learning the practical, day-to-
iday aspects of the business. Consider the experi-
ence of Jim Weston, who has been with Ford
Motor Company for three years. -

Jim came to Ford in February, 1963. His first assignment was in marketing
analysis where his principal job was evaluating present and potential’
dealer locations. For a time, he also gained experience in the actual pur-
chasing of dealer locations. Later, an assignment forecasting sales and
market potential with Ford Division’s Truck Sales Programming Depart-
ment gave him the background he needed to qualify for his present position.
His job today? Only three years out of college, Jim is now a senior ﬁnancial

‘ analyst in Ford Division’s Business Management Department.

Jim Weston’s experience is not unusual. At Ford Motor Company, your
twenties can be challenging and rewarding years. Like to learn more about
it? Talk to our representative when he visits your campus.
