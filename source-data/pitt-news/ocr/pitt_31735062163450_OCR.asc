Waltersthinks that the‘ Cadets» strength lies
in their interiorﬂline. “We have three boys, guard

center: Lee Grasfeder, who we consider three of
finest linemen in the country,” he said.

Army is a running club which is tough ‘de-
fensively. They were third in the nation. on

out four of their opponents, they have allowed
only 98 yards passing per game. They held Penn
State to 136 yards total offense, while defeating
the ‘Nittany Lions for the third straight year.

Another Cadet strong point is their kicking
game. The punter, Dick Peterson, is averaging
37 yards a boot and according to Walters “gets
the ball high in the air.” Dick 'Heydt, the place-
kicker has converted 15 of 19 extra .points_and
‘ has made 5 of 9/ ﬁeld

margin against Penn

No‘ Grid Sellouts
Here Since 1957

There hasn’t been a sellout for
a Panther, football game in Pitts-
burgh since 1957, when Pitt lost
to Oklahoma, 26-0, before a
crowd of 57,765.

The Panthers have‘ been over
200,000 in attendance for every
year but two since 1955. In 1960,
the Panther home attendance was
193,672, and in 1962 it was 175,945.

With 100,000 attendance after
the ﬁrst three home games, the
athletic department still hopes to
go over 200,000 this season. The
Panthers h a v e n ’ t accomplished
this feat in many years. The
closestthey came to it was in

Two representatives from the"

_Orange Bowl will be watching

tomorrow’s game.
The Panthers’ bowl ‘aspira-
tion not only rely on their

‘ability to win the remaining

three games, but also on how
well some of their opposition
for bowl spots fare.

As Carver said, ‘a loss by
Army tomorrow would just

about put them out of conten-

tion. So the Panthers can help

themselves best by winning‘

tomorrow. ‘
Navy is almost a certain bet

to be invited to a bowl if they

win the rest of their games and
ﬁnish with a 9-1 -record. A
Navy spokesman said recently
that “the team would prefer
to /go to the Cotton Bowl be-
cause that’s the only bowl they
have not won.”
.- Must’ Beat’Army ._

Navy plays Duke tomorrow
and after a week end off they
face Army Nov. 30. Neither
team will be favorites over the
Middies, but both are capable

.of upsets. Army is currently

ranked 12th in the country by’
the United Press International
board of coaches. . ..
Teams from the Southeast
and Southwest ~ Conference
are also‘ Panther rivals for
bowl berths. Usually the _win-
ner of the Southeast Confer— .

ence takes the host role ‘in the. ‘-

Sugar Bowl. Runners-up in

both conferences are almost

always invited to bowls. ,
This narrows the Panthers’-

‘chances even further. This is

probably what Carver had in
mind when he said a’ 9-1 rec-
ord was a must for the Pan-
thers if they are to be chosen
to play in a bowl. e

Carver may have been right
when he said, “If we lose we’re
‘out of contention.” What he
didn’t speciﬁcally say, but what
is just as true,.is that if the
Panthers’ win the next three

‘games they are almost a sure

bet to spend New Year’s Day
in the South. , .

’ Panther halfback Paul Martha
was elected to the all—East team

was chosen ;for his ﬁne play

Pan-Hner Linebacker ‘Marl-yd Schottenheimer Is Confident The Panthers Can Take Army

By MARVIN ZELKOWITZ

M a r t y Schottenheimer,
starting linebacker, is con-
ﬁdent the Panthers can stop
Army tomorrow at the Sta-
dium. \

“Army is a running
team,” he said, “and our'defen—
sive strong point is against run-
ning. Nobody has run against

us successfully, yet. I_ don’t
thing anyone can overpower us
on the. ground.” ‘

Because Army’s artillery this

‘year is of the infantry variety,
Schottenheimer, will key more
to the Cadet running attack. “I

expect Army to do most of their"

damage on the ground,” he said.-
' ' Strong Runner

1' “They have a, couple of real ’

good.runners,” he said, referring
to. halfback Ken Waldrop, and
quarterback C a r l Stichweh.
“But,” he added, “we .won’t key

to one or two men. That would’ ‘

just give someone else a chance
_ to break loose. A guy like Wal-
drop is bound to hurt us a little
no matter how many guys we
put on him. A 1
“We’ll do what the Steelers
did Sunday against Cleveland.
They knew they couldn’t stop
Jimmy Brown, so they con-
centrated more on Cleveland's
passing than most other teams
do,” he explained. “You saw
the results.” (Pittsburgh won,
9-7). -
According to Schottenheimer,
Stichweh and West Virginia’s
Jerry Yost,‘ are alike “When

 

they roll out,” he said, “they

run first and pass second.

“Of course,” he said, “I have"
to stay with my receiver until
the quarterback gets close to
the line ‘before I can commit
myself towards him.”

I More To It

(But there is more to lineback-
ing than‘ covering a ‘zone and

'1 watching for a run, according

to Schottenheimer. “Sometimes
my initial maneuver is tying a

«man up at the line of scrim-

mage. That way he doesn’t have
as much time to execute his
fakes against the defensive half-
backs,” he said.

“That’s what we did against .
Jim Kelly” (Notre Dame
end),” Schottenheimer ex-
plained. “If he gets too much
time to fake, he’s more like-
ly to get open than if he is“
held at the line. I think he
only caught something like
‘three passes against’ us this
_year.”_ (Last year, Kelly

1' broke a pass receiving record

against the Panthers).

“My job isn’t done after I.tie
up a receiver,” the linebacker
continued. “After I tie him up,
I have to go to my area. Then I
watch the quarterback’s eyes.
That way I can tell approxi-
mately where the receivers are,
and who the quarterback is go-
ing to throw_t'0.

“After that,” he continued,
“you have to have good ears. I
have to listen for calls from the
defensive halfback. If he calls
a sideline pattern, then I know‘

where to go to break up the
play.

“Linebackers can’t see a lot
of the short receivers,” he said.
“We don’t have eyes in the back
of our heads. The halfback’s
call tellsme what to do.”

Must Win Next Two
One thing the Panthers have
to do, according to Schotten-
heimer, is win. the next two
games. “The next two games
will decide if we"go to a bowl

or not,” he said. “But,” he cau-

tioned, “we have to playthem
one at a time. The game we’re
playing has to be foremost in
our minds. We have to take
each game as it comes. If we
win the games, the bowls will
take care of themselves.” ‘
The bowls may take care of
themselves, but it is the
coaches who watch the play-
_ ers, and Walt Cummins, who

ed his defensive specialist

is a real student of the game,”
Cummins said.
know as much about an oppo-
nent as he possibly can.
“That’s probably why he has
the "ability to read a play so
well,’’ Cummins added. ‘
Head coach John Michelosen,
who earlier in” the season refer-
red to Schottenheimer asI“de-
ﬁnitely our best defensive cen-
ter,” agrees with Cummins, but
“One of the reasons
“Marty plays the way he does is
because of his tremendous en-
thusiasm for the game.” '

“He tries to _-

Own Edge I
On Army

The P a n t h e r gridders
hold a, 6-2-2 edge over Army‘
in the all-time series be-
tween the two schools that
began in 1931. I

Army has not beateh the Pan-
thers since 1957 when they tri-

' umphed 29-13. _Since then the

two teams have tied twice, in
1958, 14-14, and in 1960, 7-7..

The Panthers gained much

of their advantage over the

Cadets in.‘ the early years of
the series. Pitt won the ﬁrst

_three games of the series.
They defeated the Cadets,

..-=26—0, in 1931, 18-13, in 1932

and 29-6, in \l935.

The series was disbanded un-
til 1944 when a powerful Army
team humbled the Panthers
69-7. I

After an eight year lapse the
‘series resumed on a somewhat
