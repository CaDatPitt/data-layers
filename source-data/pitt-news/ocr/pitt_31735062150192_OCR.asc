Foster Enters NYU Hall of Fame

By Sidney Grossmani
Stephen Collins Foster, writer of
America’s best loved songs, was

elected to a place in thel-{all of
Fame for Great Americans on the
campus of New York university in
the ninth quinquennial election just
closed. The announcement was
made last week by Dr. Harry Wood-
burn Chase, chancellor of the uni-
versity and acting director of the
Hall of Fame.

Named on 86 of the 108 ballots
cast by a list of distinguished Amer-
icans who comprised the -college of
electors of the shrine, Foster was
the only successful candidate in a
field of 141 nominated by the public
earlier this year.

Fletcher Hodges J r., curator of the
Foster hall collection, expressed sat-
isfaction that Stephen Foster has
been honored.

“It. is extremely gr.atifying,,to the

STEPHEN COLLINS FOSTER
posthumous award

Foster hall staff and to students of
Fosteriana,” he said, “that he re-
ceived this honor after several un-
successful attempts. Unque-stiona-
bly, this decision on the part of the
electors will meet with the approval
of the American people. There is
no one who has better expressed the
spirit of Americans than Stephen
Foster.”

“Foster hall organized a letter
writing campaign,” he explained.
“We wrote thousands of lett-ers to
all parts of the world, including let-
ters to correspondents in the United
States, Great Britain, Canada and
Central. America urging that they
write to the electors of the Hall of
Fame.”

Assistance, he added, was given
by librarians, school teachers, school
children, and a large group of col-
lectors and dealers who are inter-

; * Gudiol of‘t'h"e Toledo‘ mu- ‘early painting Ashown isa ﬁfteenth

century Catalan.panel from an altar-
piece showing the presentation of
the Virgin. This painting is typical
of the Catalan style‘ with its use of
Gothic detail, and exaggeration» of

‘facial and physical gestures. It was
loaned for the exhibit by Walter‘

Read Hovey, professor of fine arts. .

Another feature is an El Greco by
the mystical painter of ‘the late six-

teenth and early seventeenth cen-"

turies.

The survey extends to the twen-
tieth century, ending with paintings
by Pablo Picasso and Juan Gris.

Professor Guidol is well known
as a scholar in Spanish art, and also
for the photographic work of R0-
manesque sculpture which he pro-
duced in France. He has written
and lectured extensively on Spanish
art. '

He has studied at the Escuela Su-
perior de Arcquitectura, Barcelona,
where he was graduated as an arch-
itect in 1933. He has served as di-
rector of the Episcopal museum at
Vich in Spain, and has been a lec-
turer at New York university.

At present Mr. Gudiol is lecturing
at the Toledo art museum on the
history of Spanish painting.

Today’s lecture will begin at 8:30
o’clock and the public is invited.

niversity Releases Honor List
Roll Names 341 Undergraduates

For Second Semester Citation

On the blueprints of all undergraduate students, including those at
Erie and Johnstown centers, quality points averages threw 841 students
to the top of the academic heap. The honor roll ﬁgures, released by the
registrar’s office, show 70 more honor students for the second semester

of last year than for the first.

Of this group 67, with all A’s,
rated highest honors; 151, with aver-
ages between 2.9 and 2.7, ranked as
high honor students; and the re-
maining 623 students, with semes-
ter’s grades ranging between 2.7 and
2.2, gained honor rating.

Of last year's University fresh-
man, sophomore, and juni01' C1355‘
men 39 attained highest honors,
87 high honors, and 401 honors.
There are, therefore, on campus this
year 527 students who rated honors
for their academic work V last se-
mes_ter. , ‘

l  Release of an honor roll was con-

tinued last semester bypthe regiS*

Deon Proposes Cut
,n,.Publ‘ic Spending

 By Charles S. Tippetts ,
The country is now committed to the expenditure
i=of__,man”y billions of dollars for defense. This means
that there is little hope of a balanced national budget
 C in the near future. Obviously, this
can not go on for many years without
elldlﬂg. in a major economic and
ﬁnancial catastrophe. If we are to
avoid a bad inﬂation,_i_t is essential
that as much of_ the money as pos-
sible be raisedby selling bonds to
individuals and by taxation. To re-
sort _to another “borrow and buy”.
campaign as. we did during the last
war is easy, but it is-the road, to in-
ﬂation. . If the banking system -is
asked to absorb the major portion
of the bonds, it will lead to a great
expansion of bank credit and b‘ing
inﬂation nearer.

rapid expansion of the automobile industry and a
housing program to remedy a shortage of residences

it will go far to prevent a bad inﬂation that otherwise
may be inevitable.

Desperate Field Goal
Attempt Fails for Pitt;
Nebraska Gets 9-7 Win

Thurbon, Stetler Spark Frantic
Drive Against Favored Huskers

By Ben Foote

Pitt almost did it Saturday—but a desperate last minute
drive was halted on the three yard line, and end John Stahl’s
ﬁeld goal attempt skidded off histoe on the next to the last play
of the game; consequently, the rugged sons of the Midlands re-

turned to Nebraska with a 9-7

It was the second bitter struggle in two years between these

intersectional grid rivals in which
the (,_Zg_)rnhuskers eked out a victory
overithe Panthers. Possibly, the foot-
ball fates decided that Pa-nther dom-
inance. in this series lasted too long

and that the harder they made the
Panthers swallow in taking it on
the chin, the better they were re-
‘ paid. Last year it was 14-13—
three points difference in two years!
And to make it a bit harder to
take, the statistics gave coach Char-
ley Bowser’s proteges an edge in
every department but punting. A
hard charging Pitt line continually
bdoke throught the Husker forward
wall to pull down the much-her-
aided Nebraska ball-carriers, who,
only netted 77 yards from srim-
mage all afternoon.

Cross Country

Squad Seeks
IC-4A Victory

Pitt Contingent Hopes
To Better ’39 Mark

By John Chaffo

Seven University of Pittsburgh
cross country team performers will
swell the ﬁeld this afternoon over
the Van Cortland Park course in
New York city in an attempt to cap-
ture the annual IC-4A meet. The
Panthers will be out to better last
season’s performance when they
ﬁnished thirteenth in the national
competition.

Heading the list of Pitt harriers
will be sensational Walt Sterner,
number one man of the Panther
squad throughout the season. Be-
hind him, Coach Olson will prob-
ably place veteran Frank McCabe,
with sophomore Marcus Allias in
the third position. All three athletes
have displayed plenty of ability this
year and should be dangerous
threats for the national title.

Brosky, Davis Key Men

The other Pittsters upon whom
the fate of the Panthers will depend
are John Brosky and Bob Davis.
This pair will be joined by two
from the tr ioof Foote, Graham, and
Saunders.

Highlighting the lC4A meet will
be the personal duel between Les
MacMitchell of NYU, and Smith of
Penn State. - Last season, Smith lost
to the ﬂeet footed Violet star when
they matched strides over Van Cort-
land. lVIacMitchell, incidentally, is
the defender of the IC4A individual
title. -

Based on performances turned in
by both boys this year, the battle
between the “S” harriers (Smith
and Sterner) should be extremely
close. In the meet between State
and’Pitt last week, the Lion cap-
tain won by the margin of less than
a minute. - - . »

In order to cop the national meet,
Pitt will have to defeat a team

'which‘already has beaten them this

year. This team is the Michigan
State squad, runner—uplto Manhat-
tan in ‘I939. ' '

Have .500 “Average

In their regular season competi-
tion, the Pitt harriers have turned
in victories ‘over Carnegie Tech,
Slippery Rock, and Penn State. Set-
backs were suffered at the hands .of
Purdue, Army, and Michigan State.
In‘ winning the three meets, the
Panthers looked greatly ‘improved. 8
bad sign for the opposition in the
IC4_A. - ‘

Pitt will be handicapped, some-
what this season in thenationals

,due to the fact that" two of last

year’s performers, All Boulanger

B and Lew Manuwal are lost.

  Zehfuss Calls Out’

Basketball Drills

Here ~ is_ that announcement by.
Dr. Paul Zehfuss, freshman basket-
ball coach, that many "freshmen have

their ﬁrst practice session.

Dr. Zehfuss wishes to emphasize 

that any freshman, regardless Qf

The group will be divided into
teams forming a league and will
compete against each other. Capac-
ity in numbers of the freshman
squad is unlimited and those with

Punks Win Independent Crown;
Fijis-Phi Kaps Meet in IF F

Playing under adverse conditions
last Friday, the Punks completely
outclassed their closest rivals, the
Golden Bears, 33-0, to win the inde-
pendent touch football crown for
the second consecutive year.

Doctor Carlson's glamor boys
lost most of their glamor in the
mud at the start of the game for
the ﬁeld was one large mud puddle.
The result of the game was not
surprising for the Punks were top
favorites, but the score of the game
was outstanding since it was not
thought possible to score that often
in the muddy ﬁeld.

Lefty Ziolkowski and Captain
Sam Milanovich were the main
forces in swinging the game to a
rout. “Lanky Sam” Milanovich,
lineman from last year’s al1-intra-
mural team, caught three of Ziol-
kowski’s passes to record 18 points
for this year’s individual high score.

Sam Sprints 50 Yards

On one of the passes to Milano-
vich, he ran 50 yards after making
the catch. This play was the most
spectacular of the day, for Sam had
to elude the entire Golden Bear
secondary.

Larry Paffrath caught a 40 yard
pass for a touchdown in the ﬁrst
half, after outrunning the Bear
safety man. Mel Port also tallied
on one of Ziolkowski’s passes in
the end zone.

At halftime the score was 18-0 in
favor of the champions and the
Golden Bears had not even threat-
ened the guarded Punk goal line.

In contrast to last year’s point-
a-minute club, this year’s team has
strengthened their defense. This
they have done by sacriﬁcing a bit
of their scoring power and concen-
trating on the defense.

Billy Morton, speedy halfback of
the Bear team, played outstanding
ball for the losers as his passing,
kicking, and running held a faint
hope for the Golden Bears through-
out the game. -

Fijis, rm Kaps in IF Final

Greek competition in touch» foot-
ball hits its climax at 3 o’clock to-
day as the undefeated Phi Gamma
Delta team meets Phi Kappa in the
ﬁnal game of the 1940 season.

Jack Glenn is the mainstay of
the Phi Kappa team, both offen-
sively as well as defensively. On
the other side, the Phi Gams have
a more diversiﬁed attack, centered
around no one individual.

Mike Mitchell has been pitching
passes thus far this season, but the
Fijis might, without fear of loss,
pull a surprise by using Bill Mans-
field in the role of passer.

Every time you light up a Chesterﬁeld
you know why it is called the Smoker’s
Cigarette. It’s because Chesterﬁeld’s right
combination of the ﬁnest tobaccos grown

for...a cooler, hotter taste that is deﬁnitely
milder. You can’t buy a better cigarette.
