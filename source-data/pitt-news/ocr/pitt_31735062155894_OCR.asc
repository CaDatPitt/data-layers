Student Congress Stays
With Cheerleader Deal

By IRV ROTHMAN

The Women Cheerleader ‘program hit a more optimistic
note at Monday’s SC meeting, when chairman Paul Pedro
released current returns of the questionnaire sent to all
student groups. Of sixty organizations contacted, 51 have
replied—43 in favor of coed cheerleaders and four against with
four scholastic honoraries abstaining. 5 (

Apparently, the poll of the stu-9

dent organizations is coming along
as the committee expected. Said
Petro, “We soon hope to be able
to take a deﬁnite stand - one
which will be favorable to the
opinion expressed by students in
the Spring registration referen-
dum.” The present poll is being
conducted ‘to gain more organized
support for the cheerleader pro-
gram.
New Election Planned

SC delegates also heard Tom
Piemme, Men’s Council president,
speak of a new MC election plan
which will increase class repre-
sentation and proportionate stu-
dent participation in that group.

The revision of current election
methods would have presidents of
all classes automatically serve as
members of MC. There -would

   

College, Engineering & Mines
school, Business Administration
and the Education and Pharmacy
schools. In order to establish pro-
portional representation, twelve
additional delegates would be
elected at large: six from the Col-
lege; four, E & M; and two, bus
ad. 3,

The new regulations would en-
able both “Men’s Council and class
officers to work better with SC,”
said Piemme. ’

Elections Set

The proposal is an outgrowth of
a special committee composed of
the presidents of SC, MC, and
WSGA and chaired by Tom
Piemme, iwhich has completed a
manual concerning student gov-
ernment elections. This year elec-

Pitt Pet Panther Picks
Weekend for Powder

By CECY LINCOFF
Pitt Panther previously purloined poses perennial’prob-
lem-—in other words, it’s gone again.
The bronze Panther was removed from the dean of
men’s oﬁice by mysterious weekend visitors.

According to Theodore Biddle, dean of men, the Panther
was in its usual place on a table. -—

just inside the entrance of the
ofﬁce on Saturday. Monday morn-
ing, when the office was unlocked,
the Panther had disappeared.

This is the second time in three
months that the official mascot has
been the object of foul play. Be-
fore Christmas vacation, the Pan-
ther was spirited away and after
a wild goose chase, was returned
by the offenders.

The identity of the pilferers
was never publicly released.

After that episode, the Pitt pet
was removed from its hall table
home to a sanctuary in the dean
of men’s ofﬁce.

The dean of men’s office is al-
ways locked on the weekend. The
question which faces the Univer-
sity now is, “How did the culprits
gain entrance to the locked home
of the Pitt Panther?”

The ﬂag that ﬂew over Car-

gone to rest with the harp that
once sang through Tara’s halls.

The Pitt News learned
through a usually reliable
source that some_ engineers,
after paying tribute to Bac-
chus had hoisted a large green
ﬂag that boldly bore the em-
blem of the Pitt Engineers. A
watchman chased the hardy
Sons of Erin before they could

Next Monday the booklet will

It will contain information on the

methods of election.

Results Reported

SC solons heard Dave Green,
chairman of the Pitt Chest
drive, report on the results and
evaluate the recently completed
campaign.

Disappointed in the results,
Green said, “Since the end of the
war, the Chest has been in the
decline, greatly contrasted to the
increased registration here." He
felt that the seeming lack of in-
terest was due in part to the fact
that students who work in the
city or who receive money from

nate elsewhere.

The chairman recommended that
a faculty-student committee be
appointed to look into the current
Pitt Chest program to judge its
validity and ways and means to
continue it, if necessary.

SC concluded the very active
session by electing Tim Kovar
and Teddi Arvanitas senior class
SC representatives to complete

vacancies left by the originally‘

elected solons who were unable to
attend meetings.

Players Put “Grass Harp”
O11 Boards Friday, Saturday

By ART WELDY

Truman Capote’s “The Grass
Harp,” a modern day fantasy-
comedy, will be presented by
the Pitt Players at Stephen
Foster Memorial Mar. 19 and
20.

“The Grass Harp” is the story‘

of a Ybung woman, Dolly Talbo,
searching for love and companion-
ship against the will qt her sister,
Verena. When she fails to ﬁnd the
security of friendship, Dolly at-
tempts to escape life by moving
into her own world, a tree house,
accompanied by her nephew and
a humorous, though bitter-tonguéd
“Mammy.”

Posse Is Formed

Gossip about the tree dwellers
spreads through the little town by
way of the baker, the baker’s wife
the postmaster, the choirmistress,
and on and on until a posse is
formed to invade the woods and
march the “traitors to society”
back to civilization.

Fortunately, a more level-
headed member of the community,
Dr. Morris Ritz, brings the two
spinster sisters back together
again and restores tranquility to
the town.

Pope Will Direct

Louise Chianse, a transfer stu-
dent from Tech, plays the part
of the sensitive Dolly, and her
strong-willed sister Verena is
played by Sheila Elias. Several
other members of the cast of 18
include Mildred DeLoach, the
“Mammy,” Raverina Palkovitz, a
salesgirl named “Miss Baby Love
Dallas,” Laurie Rosenthal, the
doctor, and Tom Piemme, who
plays the judge.

Directing the play will be Har-
vey J. Pope. Technical director is

A Man and

By Jim Deweese
The world appears to be in a very chaotic
state at the moment. Kingdoms rise and fall, Mc-

Carthy attacks and is attacked, and here at Pitt
cheerleaders and politics come again to the fore.
Yet all lose their signiﬁcance when we think in
terms of the universe and the truths, yet unknown,
which lie beyond the stars.

Not many men pause in their .=
hectic hunt for the brass ring to
think in terms of the universe
but there are still a few to whom
political bickerings are of little
consequence. One such man
celebrated his 75th birthday last _
Sunday. His life has been one '
in which politics and power have 5
had their effect but they have _
failed to turn him from his goal. :
Liberty. Tolerance and Equality
i “As long as I have anylchoice Iwill atay only
in a country where political liberty, toleration and
equality of all citizens before the law are the
rule.” So said this man in a simple statement
of his beliefs which he exempliﬁed in 19,33lwhen
he left Nazi Germany and which he further proved
when he became’ a citizen of the United States in
1946. ‘ '-

This need for liberty was and/is as" essential
to this man as the air he breathes, for the work
to which he has dedicated his life can -only be
carried out in a‘ country which grants these rights.

. Simplicity is Keynote

effort, ‘Truman Capo'te’s “The Grass Harp.” We think they.

have a ﬁne show. We think that they‘ deserve to be seen
and appreciated by the students here. When you work
many weeks on a production of this type and know that
it is good, sharp entertainment, you like to have someone
in the audience to appreciate it. The Players used to en-
joy the thrill of packed houses every night for_ three and
four night stands. They, too, became the victims of the
lethargy that hits every organization that tries to draw
crowds to an event——the football team included. Of late,
they have been ﬁghting their way back up to the pinnacle‘
of 'success they formerly achieved and the effort» and result
have been commendable. They deserve the consideration

and attention of the University, whose other organizations 
‘ would expect the same when they have an affairto be at-

tended by the public. '

- Perhapsthe. Players’ sho_w is the answer to the many
students who are plagued by the high cost of entertain-
ment in the downtown area and surrounding communi-
ties.‘ The modest admission to “The Grass Harp” is well
worth the price and certainly within the student’s budget.

' This, too, is school spirit. '

Irislt Engineers

“Erin Go Bragh“ and the little green derbies have
beenmuch in evidence the last few days as the Pitt En-
gineers celebrate the first Engineers’ Week to be held at
Pitt and one of the few such events to be sponsored this
far east. Their initiative, spirit, and quality of the pro.-.
gram are really amazing for the novelty of the idea and
difﬁculties encountered in beginning such an affair.

True, they may have stretched the facts a little with
their “liberal” interpretation of. “Erin Go Bragh” to mean
“St. Patrick was an engineer” and the ‘supposition”‘th‘at St.

' Pat was the ﬁrst engineer since his feat of driving the

snakes from Ireland may be termed the ﬁrst “worm drive.”
It is touches like these that add humor to the over-all
seriousness of the week and we think they’re rather cute.

We’d like to wish the engineers “all the luck o’ the
Irish” and a Happy St‘. Pat’s Day. to all. '

he hoped to prove that there is one all encom-

there exists-no means of proving this theory, but

neither was there proof for his; fore-going theories
which are now universally accepted.

Even though he is hailed as not only the great-

simplicity in which this man so ﬁrmly believes,
“God is subtle, but He is not malicious.”

. It is ironic that so peaceful a man should see the
feasibility of the atomic bomb. Yet even this
thing which holds the world in the vice of fear
and distrust is subordinate to his main task.

News Slammed. Praised tor Editorial

“Fearless" [Freshman

EDITOR,
PITT NEWS:

Referring to the editorial in
the March 12 edition entitled
,‘,‘Friends, Romans, Countrymen”:

It was stated “The older girls

either hedged on the issue or re-

sorted, under pressure and fear,

to the weak, prudish, and imma- ~

tufe opposition promoted by Miss
Rush during the years of contro-
versy over the issue.” To openly
attack the dean of women in such
a scandalous manner indicates a
shameful lack of loyalty and re-

spect to the university and all its f

ideals.

\

The exact dictionary meanings

of weak, immature, and prudent
are as follows: .
“Weak——Lacking in strength of
will or stability of character;
yielding easily to temptation; pli-
ab1e;’’ ,

“Immature——Not mature; not
full grown; undeveloped.”

The position ‘of the dean of

women carries with it the direct
responsibility of ‘the social ” and
intellectual development of each
individual woman student at the
university. To accuse Miss Rush
of being immature and weak  a

glaring, ﬂagrant untruth and an
insult to every woman connected
with the university in any way.

“Prudent — Habitually careful
to avoid errors and infollowing
the most politic‘ and proﬁtable
course; cautious; worldly-wise;
exercising"sound judgement; sa-
gacious; judicious.”

If prudent means to possess all
of these exceptionally superior
traits, we are proud that our dean
of women is prudish. An apology
is unquestionably owed to Miss
Rush because of this outrageous,
heinous, coarse, indecent, and in‘-
tentionally slanderous attack.

sayiwhat she thinks . . .”

used was “prudish.”, not “pru-
dent"’.)

be doubted that women cheer-
leaders are wanted at Pitt when
students have been ﬁghting for

‘ this program for several years?

I feel that I am representing the
majority of students when I say,
“Let Student Congress go ahead

NCAA Next
Matllurdle

BY DAVE MAZER

Reaching the top after only
ﬁve years of competition,
Coach Rex Peery and his
Eastern Intercollegiate Wrest-
ling Association champs now
climb for even higher glory.

Last weekend at Cornell
University, the grapplers who

Peery

have existed as a varsity squad
sinceonly 1949, swept past de-
fending titlist Penn State and 14
other schools to emerge with the
crown.

Now, the matmen prep for the
National championships Mar. 27
and 28 at Norman, Okla. Of
course, Peery, who “can’t say
enough for those fellows,” realizes
that this last accomplishment was
the Panther’s high level mark in
his ﬁve years of reviving the sport
at Pitt. But like the old adage, he
won’t be ‘satisfied until he gets the
ultimate goal—the NCAA title.

Aggies Favored

Standing in the Panthers’ way
to the nationals are Oklahoma A.
& M., Iowa State, Oklahoma U.,

other Panther, Jim Zentgraf,
who showed 1:38.1 in 1952.

Sophomore Jim Zurcher was
the other Pitt record setter as he
set a ne ECSA mark of 4257.4
in the 440-yard free style.

vDuring Saturday’s competition
Grady and his tankers‘ were re-
ceiving running reports on the
progress of the wrestling meet in’
which Pitt was competing at
Ithaca, New York.

“Every time a Pitt wrestler
won a bout or got in the ﬁnals,”
Grady related, “that made our
boys swim all the harder. They
would go out there and swim as
if they were competing against
the wrestlers."

Jets Meet Gridders Tonight
After Taking Bridgers, 44-29

By BERNARD MORRIS
In a showdown battle for ﬁrst place in the All Star sec-
tion of the IM league," the J ohnstown Jets, for the second time,
trounced a game but clearly outclassed Bridger quinet,

I

44-29, at the Field House Mon-°

day night.
The victors will meet the Grid-
ders tonight for the All-$tar

League crown.

The Bridgers started out very
well by ringing up three straight
ﬁeld goals before the Jets connect-
with a foul shot. Throwing up a
zone defense, the Bridgers seem-
ed to befuddle J ohnstown, who lost
the ball on many occasions in the
early part of the tilt. Here Ray
Rizzo took a hand and directed
the attack for Johnstown by his
classy back-court work. The Jets

went _on a scoring spree and at ’

the end of the ﬁrst quarter led,
17-8. .
Jets Pull Ahead
Neither team could score con-

Michigan, Iow_a State Teachers,
and a host of other colleges with
top—notch wrestlers, but Peery ad-
mits that Pitt “has as good a
chance as any of the -best teams
there.”

The Oklahoma Aggies are favor-
ed to cop the country-wide tour-
ney*because of their strength in
the two heavyweight classes but,
as the coach adds, “-Any team that
comes through with a couple win-
ners and a second or third could
take it.”

The last obstacle before the na-
tionals-—-the Easterns--came much
easier than expected. Hugh Peery,
Charley Uram, and George Beres-
ford won individual crowns while
two other Blue and Gold men lost
in the ﬁnals. ‘

Peery Gets 44th

Pitt captured 37 points, nine
more than defending Penn State
and eleven ahead of Lehigh.

Peery, at 123, won his 44th
straight match, while 147-pounder
Uram and 177-pound Beresford re-
mained undefeated in intercol-
legiate competition this year.‘

Joe Solomon, 167 pounds, and
Ed DeWitt, 157 pounds, were beat-
en in close decisions in their last
tries but helped with valuable
points.

Questions Doc

By RUSS FRANKE

Sports Editor

Dr. H. C. Carlson may no longer be actiye as a hard-
wood practitioner, but we’re betting that he’ll make himself

heard this week in Kansas City,¢

/

as usual.

The robust doctor and Coach
Bob Timmons have already de-
parted for the annual pow—wow
of the National Association of
Basketball Coaches, which will
thrash out suggestions and rules’
changes tomorrow, Friday, and
Saturday. All the members will
take in the NCAA semiﬁnals and
ﬁnalsgas the sessions wind up.

Among other things, Carl-
son plans to ﬁnd out “whether

, basketball is or is not a. con-

tact sport.” _

One of the chief problems in
the game today revolves around
the “judgment” of referees in this
matter. Sometimes officials take
a beating for calling the plays too
close, and often get into serious
trouble for allowing games to
turn into free-for-alls.

Furthermore, the degree of con-
tact differs/with sections of the
country. The ex-tutor contends
that the rules governing offensive
and defensive fouling will have
to be clariﬁed before uniformity
is achieved. '

He will not be alone when
suggestions start at the meet-
ings. In order to check extreme
stalling and intentional foul-

ing, one eastern coach is expect-
ed to submit a thirty second
time limit in which the offensive
team must shoot. He also wants
a two—shot effort on all defen-
sive fouls, besides advocating a
wider free throw lane.

This latter‘ idea has some merit,
in that the tall men would lose
some of their advantage under the
boards; the short man (6-3, these
days)' will have more room to
operate.

Another proposed change would
eliminate lining up on free throws,
where the shooting team would get
the ball out of bounds when the
second free throw is missed. They
get the beneﬁt on tap—ins, any-
how.

By far, the oddest suggestion
comes from a coach who is in
favor of two baskets on each
backboard—-one 'at the regula-
tion ten-foot height and the oth-
er four feet directly above it. All
fouls would be shot for the low-
er hoop, and all ﬁeld goals
tossed through it would count
only one point. Field goals in
the upper basket,’ however,
would count two points. Anoth-
er gesture for the short man,
this coach_‘expla.in_S.

After receiving national acclaim for their record—shat-
tering performance in the two-mile relay at the Milwaukee
Journal Games last Saturday night, Coach Carl Olson sends

this same quartet to the Knights¢

of Columbus indoor meet at Cleve-
land this weekend.

Composed of Dan Sommer of
Altoona, Chuck Fritz of Wilkins-
burg, Don Delli Gatti of Connells-
ville, and Arnie Sowell of Schen-
ley, the relay squad will try, if
possible, to better their mark of
7:39.? set at the Wiscpnsin city.

This new‘ standard broke by al-
most seven seconds—the old rec-
ord recorded by Michigan in 1952.
In establishing it, the trackmen
beat teams from Michigan State,
Michigan, and Indiana.

The two mile also is theifastest

race run in the United States this

year. Senior Sommer started the
Panthers off well, junior Fritz then
took over for the middle half-
mile,’ senior Delli Gatti continued
the fast pace, and sop_h. Sowell
ﬁnished in a torrid run to clinch
