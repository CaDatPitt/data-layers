Fleming Bill Called ‘Unnecessaryi

by PAUL STOLLER,
Editor, Pitt News

The legislation proposed by State Sen. Robert Fleming (R.-Aspinwall) has
caused quite a stir on this campus. Students. faculty and administration, for the most

Picture a late March evening; cool gentle-,warm breezes. a break from the
rough winter winds. Picture students on the eve of final exams. and the break in the

"*5

weather affords them the opportunity to walk outside without" a heavy coat or boots.»

And picture rambunctious energy. and the spirit of how America is building itself for

the future.

Include all of this at this University. and anyone will see how the only two
demonstrations ever held at this conservative school every came about.

It was Monday. April 2. 1967. It was Tuesday. March 20. 1966.
Each time, the spirit of innocence prevailed, and all the students knew it would

end in the same manner.
And then . . . the city police came.

German Shepard police dogs. Billy clubs. Tear gas. Chemical Mace. Provoca-

tion.

Twice in two years, the city police catalyst ignited what started out as a mere

panty raid. And instead of one of those
monthly occurrences the older genera-
tion of college students was accustomed
to, the undergarmentlraid flamed‘into a
small-scale riot.

Everything was‘ perfect: the age-old
story of students letting off steam. The

*§§University campus police. a mere hand-

ful of men at the time, had contained

each demonstration to the campus grounds. _

Then Superintendent of Police James
Slusser was called in with the works: pad-y
dy wagons and a full corps of city offi-
cers. It would go without question that
the city police went into crowds on sev-
eral different occasions and indiscrim-
inatly removed students from the campus
grounds and detained them later at a po-
lice station.

Chancellor Wesley Posvar, in 1968,
and Acting Chancellor David Kurtzman,
in 1967, both acted with urgency on be-
half of the students. No charges were
ever brought against any of those students
detained. ‘Basically, the students haddone

ﬁiino wrong and pure facts will support

their actions.

First of all. they were (quote: dem-
onstrating (unquote). But they did this on
University grounds. the campus which
they are supporting in dollars and cents.

_ In 1967, this meant $1.400 for tuition. and

since many of the "demonstrating ‘stu-
dents“ lived in the dorms. it also meant
an additional $1.000.

Many students asked why they could
not even play in their own backyards.

Secondly, they did not intimidate the
public in any was. Except to say . . . that
when the city police were called-in for
no apparent reason, this left many parts
of a crime-ridden Pittsburgh city unpro

tected at night. j

Many students said the city police
were trespassing on Pitt's private proper-
ty. '

Lastly. thecity police. when called to
the campus. proved to be belligerent. an-
tagonistic. and apparently misinformed
about the situations. Students. vocally and
in print. testified to several acts of har-
rassment by police. And all of the stu-
dents felt the police acts provoked a reg-
ular riot.

As the situation stands now, legisla-
tion proposed in the state legislature is
designed to eliminate student “demon-
strations,” especially the type provoked
by the city police. E

‘ Also. Gov. Raymond Shafer has the’
state national guard - poised. to clamp
down on any campus irregularities.

Taking the ingredients of what ful-
fills théﬁrequirements of a panty raid.
and then defining the word riot «or “as-
saults" or "molests" I. it can be directly

. shown that forceful implementation of

‘authority through city police or national
guard increases the unrest.

If the two spring “demonstrations”
clearly show this, then the ques ion of
authenticity arises surrounding b th the
legislation and Gov. Shafer’s army of
guardsmen. '

Chancellor Posvar considered the leg-
islation "unnecessary." He cites state
rules already on the books as sufficient
to cope with demonstrations. specifically

. at Pitt.

Apparently Dr. Posvar can picture
cool spring nights . . . and he can picture
national guardsmen with rifles. bayonets
fixed. over the entire area of Oakland . . .
all just to stop a parity raid.

 

 

part. are quite upset about‘ the Aspinwall Republicans attempt to stage a legal crack-
down on “student rebels." The University opposes the Fleming legislation for the fol-
lowing reasons. , W

—THE FLEMING LEGISLATION IS UNNECESSARY.

Chancellor Wesley Posvar said Friday that legislation of the Fleming type is .

unnecessary. "There have been so far no serious disruptions or violent demonstrations
at the University of Pittsburgh." he said. I

The Black student sit-in. for example. was not a violent demonstration. While
the press play on the incident portrayed it as a violent take-over. the end result from
a peaceful dialogue and agreement on the previously accepted demands of the Black
Action Society. Unlike some of the press reports, the decision to agree to the Black

. groups’ demands was made by the Chancellor. members of his administrative staff, a
and members of the University’s Faculty Senate. It was, in short. a collective decision g

that the University handled on its own. Beyond this. Posvar stated that all College
and University president’s would "share my views on this subject." ‘ '

One might argue that Posvar is biased in his viewpoint. But his viewpoint was
echoed by no less a man than Gov. Raymond P. Shafer; In his press conference Sun-

day. Gov. Shafer stated that while the intent of the Fleming legislation was sound.‘ it .

was unnecessary. Like Dr. Posvar. the Governor has faith in the penal code as it pre-
sently exists. . -

—THE FLEMING LEGISLATION IS DAMAGING
TO UNIVERSITY AUTONOMY.
The general reaction to this statement is that the Legislature—a body that
grants the University taxpayers money—has every right to-exert its influence on state-
related and state-operated universities. It would be ludicrous for us to think that" the

' Legislature has no right to oversee the financial operation of the University. They

have every right to exercise power. But it is our feeling that only: the University
should set-up disciplinary guidelines. '

Members of the Student Affairs staff. for example. are professionally quali-
fied to exercise some sort of disciplinary function. They know full well the complex
problems that confront the student in his day to day existence. Above all, the Univer-
sity has. in the past. handled potentially violent situations with a complementary de-
gree of sophistication. The University. then. has been successful in handling its own
disciplinary affairs. ’ '

—THE FLEMING LEGISLATION
WILL BE COUNTER PRODUCTIVE.

The great fear on this campus, these days, isthat Sen. Fleming’s bill will do-

more harm than good. The great majority of students on this campus are repelled by

the widespread violence of over-publicized student disorders. But the moderate. lib-‘

eral. and radical elements of this campus are ready to coalesce in strong opposition
to the passage of the "student crackdown bill. " . ’

Instead of serving as a deterrent to violence. the passage of the Fleming legis-
lation will aggravate a tinderbox climate on this and other campuses in Pennsylvania.
And hardly anyone in this State wants to see unparalleled acts of violence on our
campuses. '

The most unfortunate aspect of this entire controversy is the gross mispercep-
tion of the issues. Both sides in this controversy have been guilty of name-calling.
Both sides in this controversy have. in a sense. polarized. Students on campus fail to

understand the reasoning behind the Fleming legislation. and legislators in Harris- —

burg fail to understand the students on this State’s campuses.

One myth that is particularly disturbing is that all students who dissent are
long-haired hippies bent on destroying the principles of the American Republic. This
is simply not the case. The majority of the students at this University are concerned
Americans who want to seek constructive change. If this were not the case, why
hasn’t there been a violent demonstration at the University of Pittsburgh?

‘The Pitt News has urged students to write letters and send telegrams to the
Legislature to show the representatives and senators in Harrisburg our widespread
opposition to the ‘Fleming bill. We hope that all the members of the State Legislature
share our fear of the consequences of the Fleming bill and vote against thejmeasure. .

Dear Legislator: We’re Only Human Beings 

That’s right . . . A DEATH STRUG-
GLE . . . corny? . . . man, it’s a shame
you didn’t make the scene Wednesday in
the Ballroom . . . or in Chicago, or in De-
troit, or in Watts, or in Newark or at San
Francisco State, or in . . . you name it.
Yeah, it’s a shame . . . a real shame.

The question. though . . . the one that‘s
got me so up tight about this country is-
how can you expect to solve a problem . . .
any problem . . . when you acknowledge
only the effects and ignore the causes . . .
when you supress the results of the prob-
lem instead of dealing with the problem
itself?

Do the State Legislators. who are sup-
posed to represent and have some under-
standing and concern about us_ as their
constitutents. actually believe that students
enjoy demonstrating. writing nasty protest
articles. confronting our administrators
(people, believe it or not. that we would

like to be able to respect but. in good con-=

science. can’tr with demands‘? Do they
think we relish having to resort to civil
disobedience and laying_our personal safe-
ty and security on the line?

OK, so they ask themselves—if students
aren't out there raising hell just for kicks,
why are they doing it? The answer, neat-
ly trimmed of all the angry phrases, nasty
four letter words, and the rest of that

“lewd, lascivious and vulgar” type behav-
ior (that just recently has been so clearly
articulated and defined for us)—is neces-
sity.

it’s the same necessity that everybody
talked about 193 years ago when their lead-
ers in government wrote the Declaration
of Independance.

How does it read‘? . . . “When in the
course of human events" .
. . . this is where it’s at] It is this human-
ness that our “leaders" refuse to deal with;
that many rights here among us refuse to
deal with.

We are human beings,'all of us. and
because of that fact we are born with. not
endowed with or given. but born with cer-
tain inalienable rights and among those
rights is the supreme right of self deter-
mination.

Why do people seize computer centers,
disrupt political conventions, burn build-
ings? . . . That’s no off the wall question,
man . . . they’ve simply learned the lan-
guage of the land. Or maybe it’s a prob-
lem of semantics . . . when a people who
have been waiting 193 years for their
promised rights to be realized get “a lit-
tle impatient” and demand action-—maybe
(just maybe now) they disagree “slightly”
with our legislators who charge that these
people expect things to “get done over-

some kinda long night.

Ya know . . . we have talked and con-
ferred and asked and pleaded and urged

During the past academic year Universit_v»stu-

"V ' dents have found that the best way to effect change

is to work through established channels. All signi-

’_ “ficant student proposals that have been initiated
_. since September were achieved by student organ-

.»izations working peacefully with the administra-
tion.

' In the first issue of last fall term (Sept. 9. 1968 l.

I , The Pitt News called for a restructuring of the Uni-
‘ ‘ versity that would include a bigger voice for stu-

dent needs. Chancellor Wesley«Posvar. in a state-

 A ment issued two days later. agreed that more stu-

«dent representation was needed in the decision-
making processes of the University. Consequently.
the Chancellor created the Undergraduate Coun-
cil._ This body. composed of administrators, faculty.

_ andjstudents. makes‘ recommendations and deci-
§' , ~, sions of academic concern. ’

Dr. Posvar also announced that an all-Univer-
sity Council would be established in the future to
deal with campus issues. In addition to administra-
tion and faculty. the Council will be represented
by graduate and undergraduate students. The pur-

_pose of the All-University Council will be to ex-
amine grades. teaching methods. rules for student
conduct. and concepts of design for future build-
ing programs. The findings of the Council.will then
be reported to the Chancellor.

, On O_ctoberl2l, the Undergraduate,Council an-
nounced the development of self-designed majors
to be immediately instituted. This is a major that
cuts through the fields of other academic majors.
Thus, a student is enabled to major in “Urban Civ-
ilization,” “Communications,” or “Chinese Cul-
ture,” for example.

Student Government. in November. announced
a revamped registration- policy. This revolutionary
new methodology for scheduling was the result of
intensive research conducted by the SG Academic
Procedures Committee. The Registrar’s Office
agreed to use the recommended procedures that al-
lowed students to have their classes confirmed min-
utes after their advisor appointments.

Student Government. on Oct. 2. approved a bill
asking the administration to request that a traffic
light be installed at the corner of Fifth Avenue and
Tennyson Street. This bill was in response to a
Septermber 25 Pitt News editorial suggesting the

. necessity for this safety measure. In response.
Chancellor Posvar contacted city Safety Director
David Craig. Craig promised that a traffic signal
would be installed as soon as possible. A police-
man was immediately dispatched to conduct pe-
destrian traffic at the corner. Last month. the traf-
fic light was finally constructed.

Liberalized social rules were a major topic of

' _ conservation during the fall term. An ad hoc com-
= . . . mittee of female students attempted to form a dem-
 onstration to protest curfew regulations. The dem-

[9 ‘st-'r'ation'was-never established.‘ ,

 

tee from the faculty._

*Students Achieve Changes
{,Through Established Channels

Instead. the University Social Committee. a ten-
member organization composed of administration.
faculty, and students worked with other existing
groups to create revised social regulations.

On Nov. 11, the committee approved new social
rules for the men’s and women's residence halls.
The proposed changes were presented by Women’s
Housing Board and Men’s Dormitory Council. The
changes included more dorm-wide open houses.
elimination of the requirement of chaperones for
residence hall social events. and the permission of
dorm residents of legal age to consume alcoholic
beverages in their rooms. The committee’s recom-
mendations were quickly approved by Assistant
Chancellor of Student Affairs Dr. Jack Critchfield‘.

The female curfew system was abolished by the
Social Committee Jan. 10. After Dr. Critchfield’s
approval, the new rules went into effect. Sopho-
more, junior, and senior women no longer have cur-
fews. Freshmen women are obligated to abide by
a2:30 stipulation. .

Aside from the successes of established organ-
izations, there have been peaceful meetings set up
by ad hoc student committees that have also been
successful. a

Many students felt thatthere was a need for di-
rect communication between students and admin-
istrators. Many campus organizations. working with
The Pitt News, established the Speak Your Peace
Conference. held Oct. 12. At the conference. stu-
dents ‘spoke with the administration and aired their
complaints. Many new ideas were recommended at
the meeting.

Ad hoc meetings, attended by 800 students, were
held Feb. 7 and 10. A list of demands were present-
ed to the administration that were immediately act-
ed upon. Chancellor»Posvar and Vice-Chancellor of

Finance Edison Montgomery promised that there '

would be no censorship of campus publications.

The Chancellor and Provost Charles Peake re-
iterated that the ROTC decision of the faculty
would be upheld. The Chancellor. per request. an-
nounced his opposition to the bill proposed by Sen.
Robert Fleming. Dr. Critchfield stated that the Uni-
versity was officially opposed to the idea of stu-

dent informers on campus. -

Dr. Critchfield also announced that Dean of
Students Ronald Pease would immediately destroy
confidential files that have been kept on female
students. Dr. Peake and Dean of the Faculty of
Arts and Sciences David Halliday agreed-to inves-
tigate a request to allow any faculty member that
so wishes. to discard the grading system.

The also announced the establishment of a
committee to review curriculum and make recom-
mendations. It was also decided that the Student
Cabinet of the College of Arts and'Sciences would
be permittedto choose a_chairman for the commit-

 
   

by a free academic community.-

Fleming Bill Vague;

Even Peaceful Debates
Can Be Termed ‘Illegal’  

by HARRIS MILLER
« Staff News Writer

The majority opinion of stu-
dents. faculty. and administrators
of the University was expressed
Monday evening at a special ses-
sion of the Student Government
(SG> when a resolution was pass-
ed making clear the Senate’s op-
position to Senator Robert D.
Fleming's proposed legislation.
The SG legislation also incfuded
a statement of support for Chan-
cellor Posvar’s actions to prevent

passage of the Fleming bill and —

support of Governor Raymond
Shaler’s statement that this bill of
Senator Fleming is unnecessary.

The debate surrounding the SG
bill brought forth the central fact

.that reactions to the passing of the

Fleming bill would be far more
deleterious to the education of the
students of this Commonwealth
than enforcement of present Uni-
versity laws concerning the ac-
tions of students on campus. SG
senators opposing the Fleming
bill indicated that they were not
supporting violent demonstrations.
nor were they objecting to the
University's right to discipline
students. Rather they were object-
ing to the vaguely worded bill
proposed by the Aspinwall legis-
lator that would destroy the au-
tonomy of the University and its
rights to administer its own af-
fairs.

SG President Scott Baum point-
ed out that in the mid-l930’s, Nazi
Germany had been witness to just
such a bill passed by Adolph Hit-
ler. That the bill is an attempt by
the state to regulate the affairs of
an academic community was
pointed out by several senators.
President Baum also stated that
the regulation by means of city
police or National Guard also is
an indication of the lack of au-
tonomy and the growth of state
regulation at the University — a
move which cannot be accepted’

 

The vague terminology of the
Fleming bill concerning lewdness
(which has not even been defined
by the Supreme Court)
who has the jurisdiction to en-
force the provisions caused much
consternation among Senators.
Within the present system. the
University administration has cer-
tain set guidelines on how to re-
act to problems in the4comr'nun-
ity.

The Fleming bill does not in-
dicate who will have jurisdiction
if it is passed. More importantly.

-/‘Z-

. ’-.a.

and“ "

it fails to take into account the re-4,,’-x,_ ,

actions of students when outside
authorities use brute force to han-
dle situations which do not war-
rant such interventions.

One Senator pointed out how
the 1968 “Spring Riots,” an an-
nual affiar of Spring fun, had
turned into a head-cracking me-
lee when the city police arrived.
On the other hand, there have
been frequent peaceful meetings
between students, faculty and the
administration during this term,
involving large number of stu-
dents that resolved issues and pro-
vided for progress within the Uni-
versity. Under the wide arch cov-

[<4

these peaceful, fruitful meetings” .

would have possibly been termed
illegal and the peace would have
turned into a ritualistic bloodbath
as has happened at many univer-
sities where gut reactions by state
officials rather than calm think-
ing led to action.

The SG Senate has passed a res-
olution which calls for the preser-

vation of the autonomy of the Uni- ~

versity. and more importantly. the
preservation of peace. They have
echoed the feelings of members of
the academic community and
other people of our society who
value justice over law and order.

is incumbent upon the legislators

in Harrisburg to heed the cry of .
