POSVAR

Pitt President
to step down
after 23 years

By Jennifer Calabrese
Senior Staff Writer

    

hen Wesley Posvar came to Pitt in 1967,
he only planned to stay on as university
president for five to 10 years.

Almost a quarter of a century later, at the close of
a term marked by administrative controversy, Posvar
has announced that he will retire at the end of this
next academic year. .

“It is clear that Posvar has made many contributions,
but I think that many faculty believe that the time has
come for new leadership,” said English Professor
Philip Wion, president of the United Faculty.

Posvar was 41 years old when he began his tenure
at Pitt, ther one of the youngestuniversity presidents
in the nation. Though Posvar has recently been
strongly criticized, he is credited with changing Pitt
from a regional university to an internationally
i recognized research institution.

In order for Pitt to gain that recognition, Posvar
first had to pull Pitt out of a $30 million debt that
existed when he came into office. He put the
university in the black in 1976. Moreover, Posvar
changed the face. of Pitt on the outside by erecting
over 30 buildings on the Oakland campus alone.

After the announcement of his departure, Posvar
pointed to the election of Pitt into the American
Association of Universities as the symbol of all of his
accomplishments. ,

“Having been elected to the AAU in the ’70s was
proof that we are perceived by our peers as one of
the top universities in America. For us to have been
elected we had to be well within that Top 25 public
universities in the nation. So we are one of the
probably 10 or 15 top universities in America,” he
said. Posvar also noted Pitt’s mention in Richard
Moll’s book The Public Ivies.

“That is ﬂattery, and means that we are supposed
to be a high-quality institution even though we have
public tuition, and I think we need to take that
challenge,” he said.

Despite his accolades, Posvar admits that he has
fallen short on some fronts.

“I could make a list of shortcomings and needs. I
think thatin affirmative action we have fallen short
of our goals and I am very disappointed about the
attrition. It is one of those things that you have to
run faster to stand still and that has to be a high
priority,” he said.

“Affirmative action is really a special program that
requires much more u p-front and direct action than
just talking about goals five years from now. As I
have said repeatedly, I make all of these
pronouncements about affirmative action, and I can
beat my breast and pound the table, but [what] it
comes down to [is that] the actual  key people who
do the recruiting and take steps [toward] retention
are the chairmen.”

Dennis Brutus, chairman of the black studies
department, disagreed.

Student leaders say it’s time for a change

By Mindy Boffemmyer
Contributing Editor

- “It’s time. it’s deﬁnitely time.”

These words, spoken by
Student Government Board
President Julie Shepard,
summarized the thoughts of many
campus leaders regarding
university President Wesley
Posvar’s decision to retire after
this year.

Shepard and other student
leaders expressed concern over
Posvar’s failure to take a “pro-
active” stance on student issues.

“I get the realsense ———— and it’s
only from my perspective — that
even though I've had the
opportunity to work one-on—one
with Dr. Posvar, the undergrad
student has gotten lost within this
university,” Shepard said.

“From what I understand, Dr.
Posvar is a brilliant man who has
to concentrate on many things at
one time," she said.

“I’ve seen him in rare cases, it
seems to me, when [the SGB] had

his total attention, without all of
his assistants — all the king's
men. I know he still has the
capacity, but it seems that focus
has gone out,” Shepard said.
“When -it comes to student
concerns it seems that focus is

very rarely there.”

According to Shepard, the next
university president should be
dynamic, young and visible.

“Don’t let it be I the rare
occurrence that we see Dr. So-

and-so strolling here and there
looking lost,” she said.

ignore that anymore,” Shepard
said.‘ _

Greg Spicer, of the Bisexual,
Gay and Lesbian Alliance, agrees.
“It seems like there’s a lot more
activism going on than there was
two years ago,” he said.

“If the next president [is] really
active on student issues, I think

[Posvar’s retirement] is a real
opportunity,” said Spicer. “I think
it’s an incredible opportunity.”

Bi—GALA confronted Posvar
earlier this year with the Reserve
Officers’ Training Corps policy
against admitting homosexuals
into that organization.

Members of Bi—GALA say that
the ROTC should be removed
from campus in accordance with
Pitt’s anti—discrimination policy.

Posvar’s response, stressing the
difference between university
policy and the policy established
by the department of defense,
did not satisfy the Senate Council,
which formed a committee to
investigate the conflict.

According to Spicer, Bi—GALA
would like to see “a president
who takes a real active position
on issues like racism on campus,
anti—gay and lesbian issues,
discriminatory practices.

“There are still university
publications that don’t print the
anti—discrimination policy. It’s

. Pitt News editors recall a quarter century of Posvar  

I
'i-:—i-j-j—j-

By Jessica Coville
Asst. Managing Editor

When selected chancellor in 1967, Pitt’s
“Golden Boy" Wesley Posvar seemed like
the best man to turn around a university
that was $30 million in debt, which he did
in a mere nine years.

Critics say he has gone from a hands-on
leader to a ﬂgurehead at the top of a
hierarchy, out of touch with the concerns
of both faculty and students.

Don Marbury, the first and only black
editor in chief of Jbe Pitt News, now
director of the Television Program Fund of
the Corporation for Public Broadcasting in

presence at Pitt during the late '60s. “I did
feel [that] change was occurring as a result
of thoughtful student activism and student
questioning," stated Marbury.

During a time when other universities
were encountering many problems with
student protests and riots, Dr. Posvar
“seemed to surround himself with staffers
that really listened to us," said Marbury.

T On the changes Dr. Posvar made during
the most volatile times at American
universities, Marbury said, “The past is
always remembered [as] better than it was,
but black enrollment did increase. Pitt
hasn't been a leader in civil rights, which
should have been on the primary agenda.

university for so long is a remarkable
achievement.” Dave T iernan, another
editor who worked with Marbury during
the late '60s and early 705, found Posvar’s
administration, "very difficult to get the
truth [from] but accessible in regards to
answers.”

Dr. Posvar still remembers T ieman for
oneparticular issue of 7bePitt News when
Nixon was re-elected in 1972: the cover
was all black with the words, “Four More
Years.”

“Posvar should be proud about what he
has done. He held the reins during a very,
very difficult time,” said Tieman.

However, it was during the late '70s that

seemed to wane. »

‘As a reporter, [I found that] the university
was approachable to a large degree, but
the administration seemed to be developing
an intolerance of dissent,” said Cris Hoel,
editor in chief of The PittNews in 1977 and
now an attorney in Pittsburgh.

“The mid-'70s for Pitt was a period of
transition from an era of activism to student
careerism,” said Matt Kennedy, another
editor from the late ’70s and now assistant
to the editor at The Pittsburgh Press. “This
seemed to be brought on during a time of
dwindling economic prospects. The
students became more concerned with
individual economic survival,” remarked

It was at this time that some
aspects of student life were not
primary focus of the
administration. “When I arrived, I
saw the last of the student rallies
against tuition hikes and race
relations. Towards the end [of the

'70s] students became concerned :

with practical things such as
registration lines and dorm space,”
said Hoel.

“Dr. Posvar is a bright man, but
[he] tended to put student life

Hoel.

“It's sad to say, but kids go to
school because of publicity of a
university’s sporting events.
Posvar has given [Pitt’s athletic
director] Dr. Bozik total control.
There's a consensus among sports
writers that the Pitt Athletic
department is a complete
laughing stock and that reflects
directly upon Dr. Posvar,” said
Enright.

“Posvar was good during the
[early years, but he hasn't changed
with the times. He's stagnated
because he has his feet planted
comfortably on the ground," said
Enright.

“After Dr. Posvar’s passing there
will be a period of enormous
change in the community. He
played a tremendous and pivotal
role to recover from the steel
industry's decline in Pittsburgh.
Friends and critics of Dr. Posvar
give him no small measure of
credit for this,” said Kennedy.

difficult to find.”

what we need first of all is the
financial commitment from the
administration,” Brutus said.

“I believe that most of the chairs
would be willing to make the
effort to recruit minority faculty if
they were assured that money
had been already set aside for
that purpose.”

Though Posvar said that calling
for a financial commitment was a
“cop-out,” Brutus said that the
administration has regularly
ignored the recommendations of
University Senate committees
who have studied the affirmative-
action problem at Pitt.

“Ideas are invited, presented r

and applauded, and then they
are forgotten. No action is taken.
That is the most serious defect,"
Brutus said.

Affirmative action is just one of
the fronts that Posvar has been
criticized about during this year.
A major conflict between the
administration and the faculty
arose’ in February, when Posvar
announced a hiring freeze in
anticipation of a low state
appropriation for Pitt. Then, the
department chairs in FAS criticized
his_“top—down” management style
and gave him a vote of no
confidence.

Posvar had planned to
announce his retirement in July
or August, but he said that
upcoming planning activities
forced him to be candid about his
intentions.

“I am chairing a meeting on the
31st of May, with 200
department chairmen and cleans,

about our master plan for the
university for the next five to 10
years, and I thought it would be
less than candid for me to stand
up there all day and talk about
the next 10 years with this
intention in mind and them sitting

there not sure what role I was
going to play,” he said.

The university’s master plan
came under fire by a University
Senate ad hoc committee last
month, which concluded that the
“seriously flawed” plan was
partially a result of a lack of

‘consultation with faculty.

“We do not feel that the
university benefits from a lack_of
consultation that characterizes the
current administration decision
making," the subcommittee
wrote.

something, and do some writing,
but I think probably my most
useful service could be in
development and fund raising,”
he said.

Posvar believes that he can
continue to be effective as
president next year even though
his colleagues are aware of his
impending departure. He says
that he will not just be a “lame
duck.” .

“There are some ways that you
can be even more effective
because you don’t have to worry
about people getting back at you.
You can be somewhat bolder
and more forthright in following
your convictions and make tough
decisions that the successor might
find it more difﬁcult to make.
You know, cutting out a program
or removing somebody or
whatever. You know I can take
more risks than ifI were going to
be here for a longer time," he
said.

been two years now,” Spicer said.
“In attitudes [like] racism and
social injustice, Pitt has a long

- way to go,” he said. “Pitt is one of

the most homophobic major
universities I’ve heard of.

“But the president needs to be
the person [who] has vision, and
sets goals and policies. The
president should show students
they can change things, that they
can participate democratically,”
Spicer added.

One of the foremost concerns
of the Black Action Society is the
lack of black faculty at Pitt.

“Black faculty number less than
Asian American faculty, and the
number of Asian Americans is so
much [lower] than African
Americans in the community,”
said BAS Chairman Doug Ligons.

That the next university

president will work to recruit
black faculty is “a foregone
conclusion," according to Ligons.

“I believe the university is under
mandate to increase black faculty,
so that’s a responsibility
regardless of who is president,”
he said.

Yet the lack of black professors
is probably worse now than it
was when Posvar first took office,
according to Ligons.

“I was kind of skeptical before
about [Posvar’s] willingness to
cooperate, so maybe this will be
a change for the better,” he said.
“He’s been here quite a long
time. Many of the administration
have been here for a long time
— [since] back when racism was
all right,” he said. “Can they
really have changed? Sometimes
I don’t believe so.”

leaders cited the “debt” situation
that existed at the university
before his arrival.

“He did what he was supposed
to do,” Ligons said. “They needed
him for economic, ﬁscal reasons.
The university was in debt.

“He was able to relieve the
debt, but that’s not necessarily
what I want in a university

“I think the president would
have to have a clue about the
business end of the university,"
Spicer said. “It would determine
whether the university would
survive or thrive."

But according to Spicer, student
concerns should be at least as
important to the university
president as business concerns.

“All of [Posvar’s] accomp-
lishments aside,” he said, “I think
that it’s a good thing, because
every resignation — not just
Posvar’s — gives people an
opportunity to think of what they
want for the university.”

a university.

When he assumed his position as Chancellor of
the University of Pittsburgh in 1967, Wesley Posvar
was one of the youngest college heads in the

6 country at age 41, and the climate on campuses

across the nation was one of discontent and unrest.
During the 24 years since, Posvar has made
many positive changes at Pitt. While his achieve-
ments deserve to be applauded, to the Pitt student
of the 80s and 90s they seem like ancient history
in light of the many student concerns that have
arisen and been ignored by the administration.
Within nine years of taking office, Posvar erased
the $30 million debt that had accumulated before
his tenure. Under Posvar’s management, Pitt has
become the largest employer in the city of Pitts-
burgh. Total employment has risen from 5,000 to

. 12,000. An upcoming expansion of Pitt's medical

facilities will add 2,000 jobs.
6 Pitt's budget has increased from $90 million in
1968 to $630 million this academic year.

The Pitt campus has seen the addition of 30

\ buildings, including Forbes Quadrangle, Hillman

library and the $60 million bio—medical center.
The University Honors College and the School of

‘ Health Related Professions were added to the

university. , ‘

Several research centers were established, in-
cluding the Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, the Pitts-
burgh Technology Center and the Center for
Hazardous Materials Research.

The Black Action Society, in’ 1969, overtook the
University Computer Center demanding “better
action for blacks,” and Posvar signed an, agree-
ment, which included recognizing two black holi-
days and recruiting black students and an implica-
tion the black faculty would increase as wellglgt the

In the 1970s Pitt was admitted into the American
Association of Universities, it as one of the top 25
public universities in the nation.

A During Posvar’s tenure, Pitt has made significant
medical advancements and earned world-class
status. Presbyterigrtﬂlniversity Hospital is among

'64 listed in “Th“e"‘Bést Hospitals inﬁmerica.” -

In athletics, Pitt has gained considerable national

 prominence and" has joined The Big East confer-

ence in several sports, including basketball, swim-
ming, baseball and track.
In 1987, Posvar and the Board of Trustees voted

\ to completely divest from South Africa.

Also in 1987, Posvar announced the money-
making “Campaign for the Third Century."

— Pitt's anti-discrirnination policy was amended in
1988 to include sexual orientation. _

In his drive to bring ﬁnancial success and world-
wide prestige to Pitt; however, Posvar has ignored
many of the educational problems and student
concerns abounding at this University.

Posvar addressed an already disgusted faculty to
announce a hiring freeze onJanuary 31 of this year.

“I think that increasingly many faculty felt dissat-
isfied with the priorities of the administration," said

Activism to stoicism — 23 years with Posvar  

Phillip Wion, associate professor of English at Pitt
and president of United Faculty of Pittsburgh.

Faculty complaints under the Posvar administra-
tion have included having to pay for job-related
expenses, including telephone calls. Also, there
isn’t enough office space for part-time faculty
members, who need access to meet with students.

Faculty members complain frequently of classes
too large to be taught effectively, though registra-
tion is increasingly difficult for students with even
the largest classes filling up quickly.

Despite the addition of 50 buildings to the Pitt
campus during Posvar’s tenure, housing remains
grossly inadequate. On- or off-campus, Pitt stu-
dents have no assurance of having a place to live
from one year to the next.

Campus leaders have voiced their concern that
Posvar is out of touch with Pitt students. As Student
Government President Julie Shepard stated, “the
undergrad student has gotten lost within this uni-
versity.”

The SGB has confronted Posvar with the lack of
student representation at Pitt.

The Bisexual, Gay and Lesbian Alliance con-
fronted Posvar on the Reserve Officers’ Training
Corps’ unfair policy of not admitting gays and
lesbians into the ROTC. ‘

The Black Action Society has repeatedly con-
fronted the Posvar administration with the lack of
black faculty at Pitt. Yet the situation is worse now
than it was in the late 60s when Posvar assumed
office.

Though Pitt students are widely considered
“apathetic,” they have raised their voices repeat-
edly to confront the administration on unfair prac-
tices.

Posvar’s response to these confrontations has A

consisted mainly of rhetoric.

Though Posvar cited that the university has’
“fallen short” of its goals for affirmative action, he
said the responsibility lied with the recruiting
officers of the university’s departments. Without
proper funding and support; however, affirmative
action is destined to fall short of any pro-active
goals. , 

When Wesley Posvar entered the University of
Pittsburgh, he was innovative leader at a time when
strong leadership was necessary to guide a univer-
sity. He dealt with problems head on, accepting the
voices of students as being as credible as his own.
And the legacy Posvar will leave on Pitt is one of
expansion and prestige. Unfortunately, this “man
of the times” was unable to see the overall picture
in his later years. Instead of moving on the pro-
action students began in the 60s, Posvar has in the
past decade, reverted to the reaction of the 1950s.

And as out-going Carnegie Mellon University
President Richard Cyert said, “No president should
remain in office more than 15 years. You lose your
effectiveness.”

Good luck Wes.

    

Meat industry very
cruel and wasteful

When I read Jessica Cov-
ille’s “Meat is murdering the
environment” article in [the
May 9 issue of The Pitt News],
I darned near fell out of my
chair. It was by far the most
important article I've ever seen

I in The Pitt News. I’d like to
make a few additional points
on this subject.

Firstly, most people have
never been exposed to the
varied and tasty world of
vegetarian food. Middle East-
ern, Indian and Chinese cui-
sines offer many good vege-

- tarian selections and are eas-

ily accessible to Pitt students. '

 

The second point I would
like to make is that there exist
people and — organizations
seeking an end to the meat
industry because of its cru-
elty, environmental damage,
economic waste and health
effects. [...l

Lastly, consider the eco-
nomic consequences of de-
creasing meat production. I've
read one estimate that meat
can be replaced with food of
equivalent nutrition for one-

sixteenth the cost. We do not
realize this difference in price
in our meat markets for two
reasons: 1) U.S. government
subsidization artificially low-
ers the price of animal feed;
and 2) the demand for many
good meatless foods is almost
negligible in our society,
thereby reducing the scale of
production and increasing unit
costs. Reduced meat produc-
tion and increased meatless
food production would elimi-
nate enormous waste of agri-
cultural resources such as

- farmland, machinery, fuel and

manpower and reduce agri-
cultural pollution. Perhaps

there is a good topic for eco-

nomics graduate research
here, eh? , V

M Our society has strong rea-
sons to eliminate animal ﬂesh
from the category of food for
people. We stand to make
enormous economic gains
society-wide while simulta-
neously preserving natural re-
sources, improving our health
and sparing hapless farm
animals from the torture of
being processed into meat.
Please give some thought to

this concept.

WEDNESDAY. MAY 16, 1990

Three Pitt players invited to Team USA basketball trials

By Scott Campbell
Assistant Sports Editor

The sun peeked through an
opening at one corner of
Fitzgerald Field House on a recent
lazy afternoon. The opening is a
portal for truck deliveries. There
are no deliveries today, but what
the heck, it’s a brilliant summer
day, so it is left open to let a
random breeze sweep through
the building.

On the gym ﬂoor, a half-dozen
guys meander around, shooting
baskets and stretching out, waiting
until an even 10 show up to play
a full- court game.

One player jogs down the lane,
lays the ball up and in and waits
for it to come down before slowly
walking it back out to shoot again.

“It must be summer! It must be
summer!” shouts former Panther
Demetreus Gore, who just entered
from the other end of the court,
observing the turtle—paced action.
Gore grabs a ball and lays it in,
mocking the other players with
an even slower—motion move.

After all, it is summer and for
most, the summer is a time for
recreational play, not the intense
grind of a long, grueling Big East
season.

But among the later arrivals are
Panther hoopers Brian Shorter,

JBobby Martin and Jason

Matthews. For this trio, this is
more than just a casual pick—up
game on a sunny afternoon.

The three have received
invitations to the U.S.A. National
Basketball Team Trials, May 17-
22, in Colorado Springs, Co., and
they are preparing for it.

The trio said they’ve been

running independently and
playing every chance they get to
stay _in shape.
“That's the key,” said Matthews.
“I just work out by myself and
play [in pick—up games], butl try
to do something every day.”

The three Panthers are among
66 players invited to the tryouts,
from which a team of 12 will be
chosen for the FIBA World
Championships, August 8-19 in
Argentina, and the Goodwill
Games, July 23-29 in Seattle,
Wash. The team will be coached
by Duke’s Mike Krzyzewski.

The U.S. squad will be
defending its 1986 FIBA title that
it captured in Spain. Los Angeles
Clipper and former Panther
Charles Smith was a member of
that 1986 gold—medal-winning
team.

Arizona and NCAA Champion
Nevada—Las Vegas led all
schools with four invitees each,
and NCAA runner-up Duke
joined Pitt as the only schools
having three, so the Panther

representation is in pretty select
company.

“I’m happy [to be invitedl,”
Shorter said. “It’s good that
people recognize that we’ve got
good players on this team, and
we could’ve easily had four
[players invited]. You know if
Darrelle [Porter] doesn’t get
invited that there's some tough
competition.”

“It’s an honor,” said Matthews,
who averaged 6.4 points and
sunk 12 of 22 three-point attempts
for the U.S.A. team in a qualifying
round for the World
Championship Tournament last
year in Mexico City. “But I’m not
surprised that we have three
people going,” Matthews added.

“lt’s something to be proud
of,” said Martin. “I just hope we
get a good chance to go out and
show what we can do.”

That may not be so easy with
the likes of Georgetown’s Alonzo
Mourning, Illinois’ Marcus
Liberty, Georgia Tech’s Kenny
Anderson and Dennis Scott,
Duke’s Christian Laettner and
Bobby Hurley, former Duke star
Danny Ferry and UNLV’s Larry
Johnson also headed to Colorado
City.

“Yeah, but I can’t worry about
who's going to be there," said
Martin. “If I get cut, at least I’ll

Leyland’s platooning system key to Pirates’  success

Editor's Note.- The statistics used
in this column do not include last
nigbt’s game against the Reds.

Boy, what's gotten into the
Pirates this season, huh? Six
players are batting over .300, nine
pitchers, two of which are six-
game winners, have an ERA under
3.00, and Bonds and Bonilla are
among the NL’ leaders in almost
every category imaginable. They
hold a comfortable four—game
lead over Montreal in the NL East,
and all looks to be rosyin the

Steel City.
The Bucs look like a totally
different team, although

comprised of basically the same
staff as last season. Everyone holds

his own theory as to why the
team is winning, ranging from
Barry Bonds’ emergence as the
player he was thought to be, to
the pitching staffs lowest ERA
(2.69) in the league, to Mike
LaValliere’s lucky poster in the
clubhouse of the Teenage Mutant
Ninja Turtles. But the key
ingredient to this season's
winning tradition is the success
(or rather acceptance) of Jim
Leyland’s platooning system.
The Pirates’ platoon at three
positions with regularity and
regular success, a feat rarely
achieved with such consistency
around the league. Third-base
honors are shared by Jeff King
and Wally Backman, Don Slaught

and LaValliere switch off catching

duties, and Sid Bream and Gary

Redus both see time at first.
The acquisition of Backman

  Mike
Rampa

was supposed to “help out" the
Pirate inﬁeld, the object being to
bring some championship
baseball experience and perhaps
leadership to an infield
desperately in need of it. Backman
proved to be a monumental

acquisition, playing a key role
both offensively and defensively
in the Pirates’ early success, and
putting the “Jeff King as—a-starter"
experiment on hold. Backman is
hitting .311 while ﬁlling the
biggest hole in the batting order.

With a formerly much—
frustrated and moderately
productive Bonds at leadoff, the
Pirates have found in Backman a
contact hitter who gets on base
over 30 percent of the time. It's
hard to ask any hitter in baseball,
power or no power, to produce
such a statistic. Backrnan’s playing
style closely resembles that of his
former teammate Len Dykstra in
the scrappy hustle, love of
winning and absolute hatred of

losing. Backman is the kind of
player you love if he’s on your
ball club, and one you can’t
stand if he’s not. Good thing he
plays in this town.

King, who was perhaps the
biggest question mark at the
beginning of the season, is slowly
increasing his average,_ up to

.207 from .193, and has played A

excellent defense while hitting
the ball hard. King has provided
key hits when the Bucs needed
them, including his stellar game
against the Cubs, when he hit his
only homer of the season and
rapped a slingshot double. He
has also had three multi—hit
games. All this in only 58 times at

Bozi/e’sjoI9 not in jeopardy oz/erHeddlesto1/z situation

Byjim Temk ~
News Editor

Pitt Athletic Director Ed Bozik
is in no danger of losing his job,
despite criticism from the local
media, according to Dr. Jack
Freeman, executive vice
president.

Bozik came under fire most
recently over his handling of an
incident involving former
Assistant Director of Athletics for
Development Bob Heddleston.

“There’s been a great deal of
foolishness written in the paper
about the whole thing,” Freeman

1 said. “I feel very strongly about

the whole thing. I think most of
the criticism about Dr. l’m;::£k 

been grossly unfair.”

Heddleston, the chief fundraiser
for Pitt athletics, admitted to
forging a check for $300 in
November. The check had been
intended for reimbursement to
the Pitt cheerleaders for a
promotional appearance. Bozik
verbally reprimanded
Heddleston, but he and Freeman
decided that the incident should
be investigated further.

“In the course of [investigating]
the matter, we determined that it
would be wise for us to review
our policies and procedures on
the handling of money within
[the Golden Panther officel,”
Freeman said.

That investigation turned up

Heddleston

$2,000 in cash contributions that
could not be accounted for. When
Heddleston could not
satisfactorily explain what had
happened to the money, Freeman
and Bozik agreed to suspend him
until the matter was cleared up.
turned in his
resignation a few days later.
Freeman stressed that the
internal audit currently being
conducted has not yet yielded
any definite results about who is
to blame for the missing cash.
“We have not made any ﬁndings
with respect to any culpability on
the part of Mr. Heddleston. He
has chosen to resign for his own
purposes,” Freeman said.

While Freeman has been

openly critical of the media’s
coverage of the situation, Bozik
has taken a more low—key
approach in dealing with the
matter.

“I have chosen not to criticize
anyone, publicly or privately. I'm
not going to engage in self-
criticism or self-praise,” Bozik
said. “I’ll leave that up to others.”

He added, “They have a job to
do  and I have a job to do. The
media has to be the judge of their
own performance. I’m the only
one who can rob myself of my
pride and my dignity.”

Bozik said that he has
confidence in his ability, but
realizes that he will’ make an
occasional mistake.

“I make mistakes every day,
practically,” he said. “Sometimes

J I take the wrong road to work

and get caught in a traffic jam;
that’s a mistake. Even doing
nothing is a mistake.”

Bozik also reaffirmed his pledge
to leave Pitt “at the time and place

of my choosing.” He does not
expect the recently announced

retirement of University President
Wesley Posvar to affect his
position, even though Posvar
brought him to Pitt and the two
are longtime friends.
“Obviously I can be fired any
time the Board of Trustees or the
president wants to fire me, ” Bozik
said. “I can’t set ‘the agenda for

Against the Reds Monday night,
King stepped in as a pinch hitter
late in the game and crunched a
solid single to keep the Bucs
hope of a late rally alive.
Consistently delivered production
when needed — not bad for a
platoon player.

In short, King has shown good
signs of being a productive player
and perhaps the asset he is
projected to be in the future if he
reaches day-to—day status. Several
Pirates, including Gold Glove
center fielder Andy Van Slyke,

a field day at the plate, boasting
a .383 average with a couple of
homers and five RBI. In a batting
order whose strength relies on
the talents of left—handed hitters,
Slaught has provided serious
right—handed power and has
given the Pirates yet another long-
ball threat and RBI manufacturer.

Sid Bream seems to have finally
gotten in the swing of things

lately. Although posting a modest ,

.214 mark at the plate, El Sid has
been a big plus on the defensive
side of the coin. He has ﬁelded
well, sporting only two errors,
while serving as an integral link
on the front and back ends of the

Right-hander Redus has two
doubles, two triples, a homer
and seven RBI in only 49 trips to
the plate. And Redus is always a
power threat.

The odds of achieving success
with six players at three positions
certainly decreases when one
takes into account the staggered
playing time, exposure to game
situations and the sheer egos of
baseball playersfmost of whom
want to play every day or be
traded if they are to platoon. But

Leyland’s players have accepted I

their roles and seem to be intent
on fulﬁlling them.

Now take six_players at three
positions "who are willing to do
whatever it takes to win, thereby
‘satisfying both personal and team
goals, and you've got an almost
foolproof formula for success.

know [that] I tried my best.”
“Anytime "they feel that they’ve

invited the best 66 players in the .

nation, you know it's gonna be
tough,” said Matthews.

Thus, the three are assembled
in the Field House to fine tune
their skills. Back on the gym

ﬂoor, enough players have shown
up and the group is split into two
teams. The pace is quicker than
the warmups, but a few players
are carrying extra baggage these
days and are here just for a game.
Don’t blame a certain three
players if they try, maybe in vain,
to pick up the tempo a little.
Every little bit helps.

By Matthew Myers
Staff Writer

Anthology movies tend to work
in one of two ways: they either
save the best story for last, or,
like Twilight Zone.- The Movie,
they slam you over the head with
it after the opening credits.
Sometimes the ﬁlms sandwich a
boring tale between two good
ones (as in New Yorle Stories). On
rare occasions, all three are good.

Tales From the Darkside: The
Movie, which opened at the King’s
Court Theatre last week, comes
close to being the latter, bridging
the anthology gap between
boredom and suspense.

Based on the popular television
series, Darksidetakes the generic
elements of the horror genre and
demythologizes them in a
predictable, mindless, yet
entertaining series of horror ﬂicks,
incorporating some excellent
innovations on the classic
formulas which inspired them.

With the scripting assistance of
horror veterans George Romero
(currently re—shooting his 1968
masterpiece Night of the Living
Dead in Washington, Pa.),
Michael McDowell (screenwriter
of Tim Burton’s Beetlejuice), Sir
Arthur Conan Doyle (legendary
creator of Sherlock Holmes) and
the ever-prolific Stephen King,
this picture does not take itself
seriously. In fact, its own lack of
devotion to the traditional styles
of the genre makes the picture
marvelously self-conscious,
offering a tongue—in-cheek
compilation that is pure cinematic
fun.

There are three tales in the
picture, not counting the “wrap-

around,” a film technique
employed by director John
Harrison to nicely link the stories
together. In this tale, Deborah
Harry (the singer who put the
blonde in Blondie) portrays a
cannibalistic suburbanite who
enjoys making meals out of 12-
year-olds.

“The meat’s more tender on the
younger ones,” says Harry as she
chops up the vegetables for her
horrible dinner party.

Her terriﬁed soon—to-be ﬂlet of
urchin manages to placate her
with selected stories from Ms.
Harry’s favorite childhood book,
the infamous Tales From the
Darkside, the movie tie—in.

Buying some time, the young
lad reads one of the stories to
Harry, who becomes intrigued by

the delightful tales of “love,’

romance and adventure.”

In the first tale, Christian Slater,
doing his most annoying Jack
Nicholson imitation to date, plays
a well-to-do college kid who is
always dressed as if he just walked
off the tennis court. Lots of fun
happens when Mr. Slater becomes
involved with a fellow student’s
“Lot 249,” a mysterious crate
containing the remnants of a 3,000-
year—old mummy.

After being cheated out of a

prestigious fellowship, our nerdy ‘

grad student decides to unleash
the mummy, reanirnated by some
3,000—year—old instructions that
came inside the box (no assembly
required), on S1ater’s unsuspecting
sister and her Ivy League
boyfriend.

But instead of killing his victims
in the traditional manner of Boris
Karloff’s Im—Ho-Tep or Lon
Chaney’s Kharis, this wrinkled,

Public Enemy
Fear of a Black Planet
Def Jam

There's been a lot happening
in the music world over the past
few years, but one band has
resurfaced over and over in the
headlines: Public Enemy.

The hype really hit the fan
after the Jews crucified Professor
Griff, Public Enemy’s “minister
of information,” for his
“anti—Semitic” statements,
another perfect example showing
that the First Amendment doesn’t
guarantee freedom of speech,
but freedom of “popular” speech.
(Griff, though credited on Fear,
has recently “left” the group on
what the press has described as
“amiable” terms.)

Not that I would agree with
anything Griff said, but they are
his opinions and he is entitled to

ENEVIY

them, just as Jews are entitled to
dislike Public Enemy.

And this wasn’t the public’s first
attempt at silencing the band.
Subtle censorship efforts slapped
PE in the face once again. Fearof
a Blacle Planet hosts a “Warning;
Explicit Lyrics” sticker, a voluntary
labeling effort prompted by the
“omniscient” Parent Music
Resource Center.

Despite all the adversity, Public
Enemy has managed to release a
third album without too much
artistic sacrifice. Of course, there’s
some in light of the warning label.

Public Enemy has created a
common ground for all races in
their battle against what they call,
“white supremacy,” not just the
Ku Klux Klan, but also the minority
of elitist whites who .control a
majority of the money and power
in this country.

Public Enemy has relinquished

smelly dude from rockin’ Ancient
Egypt prefers embalming them
alive — i.e., pulling their brains
through their noses with a coat
hanger and stuffing them with
ﬂowers, herbs and other goodies.

McDowell has done an
excellent job of adapting Sir
Arthur's original story, and Dick
Smith’s special effects are first—

rate throughout the picture. There _

are plenty of gut—wrenching,

stomach—churning moments for A

the whole family, and the comic-

book dialogue by McDowell and 

Romero works well with the black
humor presented by Harrison,
something that worked well in
Romero’s Creepshow.

Pleading to read one more tale,
our youthful captive convinces
Harry to postpone his death a
little longer in order to read “The
Cat From Hell," in which aging
William Hickey (did he ever look
young?) hires mob hitman David
Johansen, a.k.a. Buster
Poindexter, to kill the family pet.

What ensues is a violent and
unpleasant encounter between
Johansen and the black cat. The

' whole thing culminates in a scene

that should be left undescribed to
the reader, asJohansen is painfully
made aware that this cat is not to
be bothered. .

Both actors are good and the
special makeup effects are top-
notch. Harrison does some really
nice work with the ﬂashbacks,
and the transitions ' between
scenes are exceptional. Romero’s
script, while as good as
McDowell’s, owes much to King’s
original story.

Promising to read a “real love
story,” the kid in Harry’s cage
reads “Lover’s Vow,” penned by

  
   

the bat of heavy grooves with
which they beat their ideologies
into listeners. Instead, they’ve
opted for an almost intellectual
approach, hedging towards
melodic on several cuts.

A good deal of Fear of a Blacle
Planet is slanted toward a
vengeful rhetoric against the
public uproar created over the
Griff incidents. -

McDowell. In this final story,
James Remar plays a struggling
artist living in New York City (is
this redundant?) who witnesses a
brutal murder by (what else?) a
gargoyle.

In his scariest voice, the
gargoyle makes Remar promise
never to reveal what he saw that
night. On the way home, Remar
meets Rae Dawn Chong (Michael
Keaton’s girl in The Squeeze); 10
years later, they're married with
two kids. Not only is he married,
but his life has turned around; his
agent (played with relish by
Robert Klein) is back, and his
works are being shown in the

self-indulgence aside, Public
Enemy utilizes its firsthand view
of today’s black America — not
the most appealing place in their
eyes.

Tracks like “Pollywanacraka”
(dealing with interracial dating)
and “Burn Hollywood Burn” (a
shot at the film industry’s
treatment of blacks) let you know
that there ’s more than a streetwise

Then one day Chong finds some
drawings of the gargoyle, and,
well, the rest is a big surprise.

This tale is probably the best,
but it certainly doesn’t outshine
the other two. There is some
really good skin, and some hot
sex, and the gargoyle, who is the

movie, genuinely scares the hell
out of you, even though he's

off to Dick Smith.

That may be where they came
from, but they’ve capitalized on
their past and turned it around.
Some groups make music for
music's sake, others just to have
fun. Public Enemy creates music
to make people aware, and if
they piss you off in the process,
then they’ve done their job!

the most commercial of
Hollywood’s high-concept ﬁlms
must meet the first law of movie-
making. ’I'here’s something to be
said for good sit-back—and-turn-

your—brain-off entertainment, and ,

this one delivers.

It’s really more of a black comedy
than a horror anthology, but fans
of the series won’tbe disappointed
by its obvious sense of humor.
Producers Richard Rubenstein and
Mitchell Galin have come up with
a real winner, and after the
atrocities of Monkey Shines and
Pet Sematary, Romero and King
really need the business.

If it doesn’t drum up the cash,
though, Tales From the Darleside
nevertheless confirms that
obscenity and violence are, in
effect, art forms in themselves.
