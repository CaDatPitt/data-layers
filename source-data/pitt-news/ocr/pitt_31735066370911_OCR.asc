SGB approves Hillel allocation request after debate

By Jeffrey Carpenter
Staff Writer

The Student Government Board ap-
proved the B’nai B’rith Hillel alloca-
tions request to sponsor a lecture by
Robert Clary of the Simon Wiesenthal
Center. The lecture will focus on
holocaust education. 7

The approval was a change from the
board’s previous position that the lee-
ture would violate the SGB allocations
Committee’s policy with payment of
Cleary’s honorarium directly to the
center which would be a charitable con-
tribution. The policy prohibits
charitable contributions. The board ap-
parently changed its mind after meeting
with Student Activities Director An-
drew Smith. Board member Jim Mum-

ma said, “Andy Smith was able to in-
form the board of the actual intent of
this rule and why it was created in the
first place, and that was to prevent
charitable donations to organizations.
Robert Clary does not fall under this,
and that is why the board presumably
is changing its mind.”

As a result of the allocation’s con-
troversy, board member Avery
Abrams introduced a resolution charg-
ing the board, president and allocations
committee chairman with acting ir-
responsibly and in a prejudicial man-
ner concerning the Hillel request. The
resolution asked for a letter of apology
to the Hillel because “the actions of
SGB caused great concern and undo
worry to the Hillel club.”

However, the clause charging the
board,president and allocations chair-

Local group intercedes in
Farrakhan controversy  

By Dan Bates
News Editor

In an effort to reduce the potential
for violent confrontation during Rev.
Louis Farrakhan’s visit to Pitt, the
Anti-Defamation League of Pittsburgh
is arranging a meeting between con-
cerned parties.

Howard Ross, the regional director
of the local Anti-Defamation League,
is attempting to get Mordechai Levy,
the leader of the New York-based rnili—
tant Jewish Defense Organization, to
meet with Pittsburgh Public Safety
Director John Norton. Ross said he
would like to avoid violence if at all
possible.

“We are concerned about the situa-
tion because Mordechai Levy is a
radical,” Ross said. “And he condones
violence, therefore he must be con-
demned.”

Ross’ concern stems from recent
reports that Levy and members of the
J D0 will be coming to Pitt when Far-
rakhan speaks. Levy said members of
his group would be carrying ﬁrearms

‘ as they rally against Farrakhan. “We

are declaring _war,_" Levy said. '
-Ross said he in no way supports Far-

rakhan. However‘, Ross said he_d_'oes X

defend the freedom of speech, and
more importantly, he condemns all
forms of violence. He said he hopes
Levy will reach- an understanding with

the Public Safety Director.

John Norton said he is more than
willing to listen to what Levy has to
say. “I feel that violence is an
abornination_and is wrong, but I am in-
terested in civil rights, so we’re going
to deal with this matter in a manner

which is fair and equitable,” Norton

said.

Norton added that he would merely
explain to Levy that, regardless of the
circumstances, we must all obey the
law.

Mordechai Levy said he is also will-
ing to discuss the situation with Nor-
ton. “I am not against the meeting with
the Public Safety Director at all,” Levy
said. “If he [Norton] is a decent man,
I will listen to what he has to say, but
I will also tell him that Farrakhan is the

.one who is not keeping the peace in this

situation.” Levy added, however, that
he would respect Norton’s judgement
on the matter.

General security during Farrakhan’s
visit will be taken care of by Pitt’s cam-
pus police. Pitt’s Public Safety Direc-
tor, William Tucker, said security will

not be compromised. He would not '

disclose any details, but he did‘ say
metal’ detectors will be used at the en-
trance of the Fitzgerald«'Field- House
where the speech will be held. ' “
“Wewill be protecting the freedom
of speech as well as physicalbeings and
campus "property," Tucker. said". “If
anyone resorts to violence, they will be
arrested.” V I

Chemistry computer dedicated

The Department of Chemistry at the University of Pittsburgh will
dedicate its newly acquired Harris H1000 supercomputer today at the
University Club. The computer, valued at $400,000, was acquired through
a gift from the Harris Corporation and a grant from the National Science

“With the acquisition of the H1000, the chemistry department has one
of the most powerful computer systems to be found in any university
chemistry department,” said Kenneth Jordan, professor of chemistry and
principal user of the new computer. “We can now extend our theoretical
studies to much more complex molecules and can develop more realistic
models of reaction mechanisms. Such studies can ultimately lead to the
design of new synthetic pathways in the development of new catalysts.”

The Harris H1000 can perform four million instructions per second and
handle 256 simultaneous interactive users. It is primarily used for com-
putational studies of the structure and reactivity of molecules. “These are
very demanding projects making extensive use of the computer’s com-
putational power and its ability to rapidly transfer data between disk and
main memory,” said Jordan. “It is now possible to obtain results in hours
that, in the past, took days and sometimes weeks on the main campus

man with acting irresponsibly and with
prejudice was later removed by an
amendment offered by Dan Taylor. “I
think his [Abrams] intent is definitely
clear in this case. The Hillel request
was dragged out over the four weeks
and might have caused them some un-
do worry,” Taylor said.

Taylor further stated that he believed
the charges were valid, but he said the
rest of the board might not agree with
him. He said he felt that the board
might, however, agree that, “the Hillel
program was caught up in something
other than strict interpretation of pro-
cedure or policy.” -

Two other budget requests were
presented by the allocation committee.
The budget for the Women’s Choral
Ensemble for $1026.55 was approved.

Funding for the Studio Theatre’s

production of “Key Exchange” was
also approved for $800.49. Allocations
chairman Pamela Underwood said that
the production will be presented at the
dance studio in Trees Hall.

This was a departure from normal
shows because the Studio Theatre

. wanted students to work in unfamiliar_

space, since most theatre is performed
by traveling groups in unfamiliar sur-
roundings. The request stated that since
travelling groups change locations
often, it is necessary for students to ex-
perience performing in unfamiliar
places.

Board president Luke Kluchko said
the lecture committee of the Pitt Pro-
gram Council asked the SGB to co-
sponsor a lecture by Rev. Jesse Jackson
for the winter term.

In other business, the issue of the

Louis Farrakahn lecture was brought
up by Abrams. He said that he opposed
the remarks of Mordechai Levy of the
Jewish Defense Organization, who
recently threatened violence because of
the lecture.

“Although Mr. Levy and some peo-
ple, myself included, may feel that
some of the JDO’s works are impor-
tant to bring defense to Jews, I don’t

believe that violence is the solution to»

the problems,” said Abrams.

“Threatening the Pitt university with
violence is not needed,” said board
member Mike Ryan. “Everyone here,
even the Jewish groups, are not for
violence. We have no need for an out-
side group to come in and threaten
violence. I don’t know what it will pro-
ve. Violence does not make believers
out of any group.”

  AT&T gm

By David Zafris
Staff Writer ‘

Pitt armounced Friday the creation of
a new graduate program in telecom-
munications, spawned from a $300,000‘
grant from the AT&T Foundation. The
program will be aimed at training net-
work designers and managers in.the
field of integrated voice, data and im-
age telecommunications networks.

Those who complete the program
will earn a Master of Science in
Telecommunications degree. The pro-
gram will be the largest study in the na-
tion in information professions, accord-
ing to Pitt officials.

“Students in the program will have
access to the most advanced computing
system of any campus in the United
States,” said Allen Kent, interim dean
of Pitt’s School of Library and Infor-
mation Science.

Kent‘ said there is a shortage of

I qualified people who are able to

manage and operate telecommunica-
tions networks in our society.

“A technical- and' business
background is needed by telecom-

nt , spawns grad,  program     

I expressed his gratitude toward AT&T.i'
‘ 'We’re extremely happy and grateful ’

{mi'mications managers vin order to

develop plans to deal‘ with trade-offs
among the different systems in the
marketplace,” he said. “Given the
competition in this ﬁeld, it promises to
be a long-tenn professional career.”

The 48-credit MST program is
scheduled to begin in January 1987 and
will include courses in network hard-
ware and software, telecommunications
devices, network design, protocols and
interfacing, legal and regulatory issues
and project management and control.

The program will be based in the in-
terdisciplinary Department of Informa-
tion Science and will draw upon the
resources of Pitt’s departments of
Computer Science, Electrical
Engineering, Communications and the
Graduate School of Business.

“The AT&T grant will help us
create the foremost program of
telecommunications education in the
country and prepare leaders and
managers to meet the growing
challenges of telecommunications into
the next century,” said Pitt’s President
Wesley Posvar.

Pitt’s Provost Roger Benjamin also 4

that AT&T showed up as a partner in

the effort to really help this university‘

to position itself for the 21st century, ’ ’
he said.

The new MST program will give
students access to Pitt’s “campus of the
future,” the new integrated voice, data
and video communications network
designed by AT&T information
systems. A ﬁber-optic cable network
will link Pitt ofﬁces, classrooms,
laboratories and dormitories with com-
puter and video sources to provide
students and faculty with the most
sophisticated and powerful information
networks, according to Pitt officials.

A nationwide group of corporate and
academic leaders in telecommunica-
tions will advise the MST program.

AT&T is also sponsoring a series of
lectures later this year by telecom-
munications engineers and scientists
from the company’s Bell Laboratories.
The lecture series will bring 18
speakers to Pitt to discuss information

Chrysler strike ends;
plants reopen today

DETROIT, MI — Chrysler facilities
opened today following yesterday’s
ratiﬁcation vote by rank-and-ﬁle auto
workers. Seventy thousand workers
walked off the job nearly two weeks
ago, but last Wednesday negotiators
reached a tentative agreement giving
the United Auto Workers wage parity
with Ford and GM workers plus a
$2,100 bonus. The parity amounts to
an 11¢ per hour increase of current
wages. The 35 month agreement would
pay assemblers $13.34 per hour and
give them a quarterly cost of living in-
crease due in December.

Vitamin C prevents
AIDS, chemist says

PORTLAND, ORE —- Longtime
vitamin C champion and Nobel Prize
winning chemist Linus Pauling said
large doses of the vitamin also may be
effective in preventing AIDS. AIDS is
the disease that destroys the body’s im-
mune system. Vitamin C is known to
strengthen the immune system and
deactivate viruses. Pauling is well-
known for his belief in vitamin C as a
weapon against the common cold.

ﬁve months later its booster rocket
failed. The satellite was drifting in a
useless orbit too close to earth. Hughes
ofﬁcials feared the satellite’s propellant
may have frozen and cracked. They
gave the device a 50-50 chance of start-
ing, but the tests just before noon
yesterday conﬁrmed that the sun did its
job of heating the satellite up. Hughes
paid NASA $10 million for this repair
job. Now, if all the satellite’s com-
munication systems are ‘in order, the
Navy will take it over next month.

Radioactive spill treated

BERWICK, PA —- Plant ofﬁcials
said about ten gallons of radioactive
water were spilled at the Susquehanna
Steam nuclear plant in Columbia coun-

blown gasket in a turbine building. A
plant spokesman said nothing leaked
from the plant and no one was exposed
to the water. He said the water was col-
lected through drains in the ﬂoor of the
building and treated without incident.

Kansas City Royals
make baseball history

KANSAS CITY, MO — The Kan-
sas City Royals made baseball history
last night when they became the World
Champions of baseball for 1985 .

While embarassing the St. Louis
Cardinals 11-0 in the seventh and
deciding game at Royal Stadium, KC
became the ﬁrst . team in baseball
history to win the world championship
after losing the ﬁrst two games of the
series at home.

The Royals pounded out 14 hits off
seven St. Louis pitchers. Darryl
Motley drove in three runs with a
homer and a single and George Brett
went four-for—ﬁve. St. Louis’ starting
left-hander John Tudor — winner in
games one and four — lasted just two
and two—thirds innings.

Almost lost in the victory was KC ’s
Bret Saberhagen. The 21-year-old
right—hander picked up his second win
of the series by shutting down the Red-
birds on ﬁve hits.

Cardinals manager Whitey Herzog
and reliever Joaquin Andujar were
ejected from the game during Kansas-
City’s record—tying six-run ﬁfth inning.

Tudor lacerated his ﬁnger back in the
clubhouse after being removed from
the game when he punched a metal fan.

Hussein and Arafat
plan peace talks

Mideast —— Jordan's King Hussein
and PLO leader Yasser Arafat are
scheduled to talk about their mideast
peace plan today for the ﬁrst time since
February.

Jordan let it be known it’s not hap-
py with recent terrorist acts linked to
the Palestinians, most notably the
Achille Lauro hijacking.

A report in The New York Times says
Hussein may threaten to leave Arafat
out of the joint initiative, but a Jorda-
nian ofﬁcial said yesterday that Jordan
would not try to seek a “separate set-
tlement of the Palestinian question.”

PLO participation is the touchrest
aspect of any Arab-Israeli talks. Israel
refuses to negotiate with the PLO, but
has consented to allow Palestinians to
take part in the process.

Israeli prime minister Peres proposed
such direct dealings last week at the
United Nations. Jordan and Egypt said
they’re studying the idea. Arafat has
dismissed it as a public relations
“maneuver” to improve Israel’s
image.

The proposal is causing political pro-
blems for Peres at home. Conservative
members of his coalition government
opposed any negotiations that might
lead to giving up part of the West Bank
or Gaza Strip. The Israeli parliament
will debate a no-conﬁdence motion on
the government today.

The political developments follow
another Israeli air attack on Palestinian
guerrilla bases. Four weeks after the
raid on PLO headquarters in Tunisia,

H Israeli warplanes struck two Palestinian

bases yesterday in Lebanon’s Bekaa
Valley.

Peace or Rhet“oric

Once more the president of the United States, Ronald
Reagan — otherwise known as the Great Communicator —
has demonstrated that, if nothing else, he is a splendidly gifted
orator, His address last week to a General Assembly ses-
sion of the United Nations was a marvelously polished and
well-crafted piece of rhetoric — hollow and empty though
it was. And, not unexpectedly, it was well-received by those
groups and interests most important to the president; the
American public was enchanted, our European allies were
pleased and American mass media representatives were
bewitched. .

The message underlying Mr. Reagan’s rhetoric was brutal-
ly obvious: The Soviet Union is an evil, war-mongering na-
tion interested solely in the overthrow of capitalism and global
domination. Cunning and sly, it seeks to foster the spread
of communism by fomenting regional strife, insurrection and
revolution. The United States, on the other hand, is a peace-
loving. nation, and Ronald Reagan IS the champion of
democracy and justice. The United States becomes involved
in regional conﬂicts only where it is necessary to protect
democracy from the spread of communism or some other
equally vile movement. As such, the American—backed “Con—
tra” rebels in Nicaraugua are described as “struggling,
democratic, resistance forces. "

Mr. Reagan takes a highly selective view of superpower
intervention, urging the Soviet Union in his address to join
with the United States in resolving regional conﬂicts but citing
only cases involving Soviet intervention. Unmentioned is the
U.S. backing of highly unpopular, dictatorial regimes in
Chile, South Korea or the Philippines. To Mr. Reagan’s
distorted perception where the Soviet Union is involved, it
is a malicious crime against humanity; however, where the
United States takes action, it is a saintly mission undertaken
in the interests of justice and peace.

The peace-making process in regional conﬂict cannot be
so selective. Instances of American involvement. in regional
conﬂict are equally disruptive to global peace and must be
‘recognized as such. The Soviet Union will remain unwill-
ing to assume joint responsibility for peace-making in these
conﬂicts as long as the United States refuses to admit its own

‘ culpability.

BAS Irresponsible

As a student at the University of
Pittsburgh, I am distressed with the
decision of the Black Action Society in
inviting Louis Farrakhan to speak.
However, as a student of our legal
system, I support the right of the BAS
and of Mr. Farrakhan to hold their
views. It is their constitutional right,
and the fact that it may not comport
with some of our opinions or may of-
fend our sensibilities does not diminish
this most important right. This right,
however, is not always conducive to
responsible and useful exercise of the
freedom of speech and religion. Such
is the case with the invitation to Mr.
Farrakhan.

The BAS, in extending this invitation
to Mr. Farrakhan, is not acting respon-
sibly. By inviting him, it is giving up
any bona ﬁde efforts to bring about a
better understanding of the position of
black Americans. The beliefs and
theories of responsible black leaders in
this country have been neglected and
replaced by sensationalistic rabble-
rousing. What is the usefulness of this?
How are Mr. Farrakhan’s exciting ex-
pressions of rebellion and religious
degradation going to forward the
legitimate interests and needs of the
black community?

As I see it, they will not. I admit that
I have not experienced the pain and
anger of widespread social apathy
which so many blacks in this society
have endured. Were I black, perhaps
I, too, would welcome a different ap-
proach through which I could vent my
frustration. But at the same time I
would want to see the end of such pre-
judice. This need will not be forward-
ed by Mr. Farrakhan’s presence.

Mr. Farrakhan’s views act to further
divide the black and white com-
munities. Such division will not enable
a separate black society to develop and
thrive in the midst of this “white” na-
tion. The efforts of the black communi-
ty in the United States should be
directed toward advancing within the
admittedly white world, not outside of
it. Any other attempt, as worthy as it
may be, is not realistic. A responsible
group such as the BAS should
recognize this and encourage an
understanding of this reality. By in-
viting Mr. Farrakhan to Pitt, it is do-
ing just the opposite.

Rather than endorsing such blatant
racism (the very thing which respon-
sible blacks are fighting against), the
BAS should discourage it by revoking
the invitation to Mr. Farrakhan and in-
viting a responsible black leader with
views which will be useful to the black
community at large. To do otherwise

is to strip the legitimacy from the BAS
and the efforts of the black movement
itself. If the concern of the society is
to put an end to the racial stupidity of
this nation and advance blacks as a peo-
ple to the equal position of whites, then
a responsible and respectable person
should replace Mr. Farrakhan.
However, if the BAS’ concern is mere-

lly to get a “big name” and to enter-

tain, excite and -rekindle the radical
ﬂame in us all, then perhaps Mr. Far-
rakhan is the man to speak. If this is
the case, then one might argue that the
BAS has outlived its usefulness.

Sexism

_ On the front page of your Oct. 21
issue, Joan Mondale is quoted as say-
ing: “I am disappointed with some of
the women in politics. An example
would be [Supreme Court Justice] San-
dra Day O’Connor. She is a very
shrewd woman, yet she votes as con-
servative as a man would vote. We
need women in politics who think like
women.” » .

By saying this, Mrs. Mondale is
showing her own sexism. She is sug-
gesting that it is somehow inappropriate
for a woman to vote conservatively,
“like a man would vote.”

In doing this, she is making an un-
fair distinction between the sexes — un-
fair to men and unfair to women. It is
unfair to men because it suggests that
men are particularly conservative
(which isn’t the case on all issues), and
it is particularly unfair to women
because it suggests that women ought

’ not to vote conservatively because they

are women. This suggests that a
woman is somehow betraying her sex
when, in good conscience, she votes
conservatively even on issues that don’t
deal directly or particularly with
women.

Taking Aim

In response to the recent controver-
sy surrounding the forthcoming visit of
Louis Farrakhan, I would like to clarify
just who the Jewish people are and how
Judaism started.

Early man knew that a higher power
existed. Some recognized this power to
be a personal being, while others
thought that it was merely a natural
force. To settle the matter, this per-
sonal being (whom I shall refer to as
God) approached a man named

 

Abraham approximately 4,000 years
ago. Some very unusual requests were
made of Abraham by God, one of
which was to sacrifice Abraham’s on-
ly son, Isaac. Abraham had great faith
in God and was about to perform this
sacrifice when God stopped him, com-
mended himfor his faith and promised
to make his descendants into a great na-
tion — a people set apart. This was the
planting of the seed of Judaism. Isaac,
in turn, had a son, Jacob. God even-
tually changed J acob’s name to Israel,
and we had the birth of a mighty nation.

, Of course, this is an extremely con-
densed version of the history of Israel,
but it will suffice for my purpose here.

Clearly, both the nation of Israel and
Judaism were God’s idea, not man’s.

By calling Judaism a “gutter religion,” _

Louis Farrakhan is not merely slighting
the Jews; he is mocking the Living
God.

Many people still think "that God is
just some natural force. Still others —
among whom Farrakhan is numbered
—— may concede that God is a person
but continually refuse to acknowledge
Him for who He is. “He” is the God
of Israel, the First and the Last, the
lvlighl/ilty Redeemer, Jehovah, the great

A .

Farrakhan is not only socially jg-
norant; he is spiritually ignorant as
well. He is not doing his constituency
any favor — or should I say that they,
by following him, are not doing
themselves any favor. On numerous
occasions, God said to Israel, “I will
bless those who bless you, and. curse
those who curse you.”

It’s just not proﬁtable to mock the
people or the God of Israel or to align
yourself with one who does.

Incidentally, this has been written by

a Gentile.

The Federal Deffcitz A I')ifferentﬁViewpoint

One of the things-that frustrates in-
telligent discussion of the government
debt is the belief that the Reagan tax
cuts (which were really cuts in the rates
at which taxes increased) caused the
deficit. The logic behind this argument,
which seems sound on the surface, is
based on the notion that federal
revenues declined after the tax cuts
went into effect.

The truth, as usual, is stranger than

fiction: In the ﬁrst'year of the Reagan
administration, the government actual-
ly took in $174 billion more than it did
the year before. (I call this the Giant
Eagle effect: like a store which gets
more customers and higher profits
from lower prices, a government which
cuts taxes gets more taxpayers and
therefore more revenues.) Unfortunate-
ly, Congress passed a budget which
called for nearly $200 billion more than
they collected — and contrary to liberal

mythology, defense spending was not
the sole culprit.

Another contributing factor to the
federal deficit has a good news/bad
news ﬂavor to it: namely, the Reagan
administration’s knowledge of the true
cause of inﬂation. When a government
spends more money-than it has, it has
three sh0rt—term ways of paying off its
debts. First, it can raise taxes. The
problem with this solution is the
disastrous long-term effects of remov-
ing money from the wealth-creating
capability of the private sector. These
effects are compounded by govern-
ment’s tendency to spend its revenues
in ways which do not create wealth.

Second, if that government has com-
plete control of the money supply and
issues paper money, it can simply print
an excessive amount (i.e., money with
no backing) and try to pay its debt with
it. This is known as inﬂation, of the

money supply, or inﬂation for short.
The natural response to this devalua-
tion of money is well-known: Pro-
ducers charge more for their goods,
workers demand higher wages, oil pro-
ducers raise their prices, and the
general public blames one of’ these
three groups rather than the real culprit
— the government.

The third method is even worse than
the first two: namely, their combina-
tion. This was the Johnson, Nixon,
Ford and Carter administrations’
strategy. It resulted in a desperate elec-
torate saying “No more!” in the form
of two landslide victories for Ronald
Reagan. (We Americans should con-
sider ourselves very fortunate. The
Weimar Republic in Germany used this
approach, and they got Aldolf Hitler!)
Since Reagan refuses to raise taxes
(that would only decrease federal
revenues) and also refuses to print an

extra pile of money (as that would
bring back high inﬂation), congres-
sional representatives can easily blame
the deﬁcit on the president‘s good fiscal
sense instead of their own desire to
spend money they don’t have.

One way to end the deficit is to sub-
ject all government programs (no ex-
ceptions) to a two-step review. First we
would ask, “Does this program help
the entire nation or just a few? Does
it create jobs and wealth or just busy
work and red tape?” If the answer is
“the few,” that’s the end of that pro-
gram — no if’s, and’s or but’s.

The second test, given to the pro-
grams which pass the first hurdle, is
“How much money is required to meet
this program’s objectives?” Most
government programs get more money
than they deserve (including, dear
reader, the ones you like) and waste
much of it. Don’t let the stories about

$600 hammers fool you into thinking
that only the Pentagon wastes money
or is the biggest money waster — “60
Minutes” once did a story on a non-
military governmental department
which built a multimillion-dollar office
building and never moved in. (The big-
gest money waster in government is the
House of Representatives.)

This brings me to the second and less
explicit point of the discussion: the
relationship of the individual to the
state. The government is supposed to
work for us, not the other way around.
When the government spends too much
money and refuses to change its ways,
it is not your duty to pay higher taxes
— you are not a national resource. If
you have any duty in this matter at all,
it is to “throw the bums out” in next
year’s election — and to tell the ad-
vocates of -higher taxes where to stick

Alumni form aggressive organization

By Michael Ashford
Staff Writer

A unique alumni organization is
establishing itself on campus with the
intent of drawing attention to pro-
gressive and potentially volatile univer-
sity issues. I

The Pitt Alumni for a Responsible
University, with a current membership
of graduate students and faculty

' representing almost every school at the

university, will be pursuing issues
ranging from sex and minority
discrimination in university employ-
ment practices to the divestment of
university holdings in companies do-
ing business in South Africa.

“It is our belief that if Pitt were more
sensitive to the kinds of concerns which
we advocate, its image would be more
positive and its reputation enhanced,”
said Chuck Pascal, executive director
of PARU. .

One of the issues PARU will be ad-
dressing is the use of university funds
to prevent the formation of a faculty
union. The United Faculty, unable to
overcome administration opposition,
has been trying to organize at Pitt for
three years now. Pascal pointed out that

I every ruling in favor of the union has

been appealed by the administration at
a potential cost running into hundreds
of thousands of dollars. “The appeals
process has gone on for too long,” he

to voice concern about campus issues

‘ ‘It is our belief that if Pitt were more sensitive to the
kinds of concerns which we advocate, its image would
be more positive and its reputation enhanced. ”

said, “and the money behind their
resistance comes from tuition, alumni
and endowment ﬁmds and state tax-
payers.”

The new association will also be
working to enhance the university’s
relations with the Oakland communi-
ty. PARU is suggesting ﬁnancial
rewards for university employees of-
fering community services, for exam-
ple, as well as new lower rates for ex-
isting services. “Local residents are
paying taxes which go to the universi-
ty,” Pascal said, “often with their own
kids going to school here. They should
get some benefits.”

Concerning possible minority and
sex discrimination in university
employment practices, PARU is ad-
vocating a review of salaries to uncover
latent inequalities between male and
female employees. In a related issue,
PARU is seeking what it sees as a more
just representation of minorities and

women in university positions of
authority. “Women are particularly
missing from the ‘high places’ at the
university, and the ‘old-boy’ network
must come to an end,” Pascal said.

Pascal further criticized the univer-
sity administration for creating hostility
and distrust between individual schools
and their faculties and the administra-
tion. He called the administration’s at-
tempt to eliminate the School of Phar-
macology “simply not healthy for the
university as a whole.” In this case,
Pascal maintained, the administration
had chosen the most confrontational ap-
proach to the school’s ﬁnancial prob-
lems, ignoring other feasible alter-
natives for manipulating the budget.

“While we do have some problem
with specific university policies,”
Pascal said, “we are still boosters of
the university and proud to be
graduates of an institution of the quality
of Pitt.”

N EA creates guidelines

The Pitt News, October 2(8, 1985

for AIDS

cases to curb confusion in schools

The National Education Association
board of directors has adopted
guidelines for dealing with the problem
of AIDS in public schools.

The guidelines, which will be recom-
mended to NEA’s affiliates for use in
school districts, colleges and univer-
sities, address various matters, in-
cluding whether and under what cir-
cumstances: 1) students or school
employees who have or could transmit
AIDS should be permitted to remain in
the school setting; 2) a school employer
should be able to require a student or

school employee to be tested for AIDS;

3) a school employee should be re-
quired to teach or provide other per-
sonal contact services to an AIDS-
infected student; and 4) information
about the condition of an AIDS-
infected student or school employee
should be made available to others.
Although the guidelines indicate the
approach that the NEA believes should
be taken with regard to the above mat-
ters, they do not attempt to take a posi-
tion on every relevant question- Many
questions are left unanswered and
should be addressed at the local level
as part of the implementation process.

The NBA guidelines recommend that

‘ ‘The NEA guidelines are designed to strike a balance
between the right of an AIDS victim to an education or
continued employment, and the right of other students
and school employees to be free from the risk of exposure

to a fatal disease. ”

a similar case-by-case determination be
made with regard to the continued
employment of school employees who
have or could transmit AIDS. The

The NEA guidelines are consistent
with the recommendations made by the
Federal Center for Disease Control for
dealing with AIDS-infected students.
Speciﬁcally, the guidelines do not ad-
vocate the categorical admission or ex-
clusion of AIDS-infected students, but
rather provide for this determination to
be made on a case-by-case basis by a
team consisting of public health person-
nel. The only exception is for a limited
category of infected students who for
certain reasons pose a greater-than-
normal risk of AIDS transmission. The
guidelines in the case recommend that
such students be excluded.

guidelines also seek to protect the
legitimate privacy rights of students
and school employees and to provide
appropriate guarantees for those in-
dividuals who are not permitted to re-
main in the school setting. Excluded
students, for example, are to be afford-
ed an adequate alternative education.
_ NEA president Mary Futrell stated
that, “ the NEA-guidelines are de-
signed to strike a balance between the
right of an AIDS victim to an educa-
tion or continued employment and the
right of other students and school
employees to be free from the risk of
exposure to a fatal disease.” She add-
ed that the guidelines are based on ex-
isting medical information regarding
AIDS and will be reviewed periodically
as new information becomes available.

Jarvik-7 patient awaits donor organ

By Susan Washburn
The Pitt News

Presbyterian-University Hospital
conducted the first artiﬁcial heart
transplant ever done in a Pittsburgh
hospital last week. Thomas Gaidosh
received the Jarvik-7 heart as a tem-
porary measure so he could live until
a donor heart can be found.

The surgical team was headed by Dr.
Bartley Griffith and consisted of Dr.
Robert Hardesty and Dr. Alfredo
Trento.

Hospital spokesmen - claim the
Jarvik-7 is working perfectly, and there
appear to be no major complications.
They also stated that Thomas Gaidosh
is alert and responsive. Mrs. Gaidosh
said the family is “very pleased” with

Jerry Rubin

the outcome of the surgery.
However, the search continues for an
adequate donor. Gaidosh is estimated
to be 6 feet 5 inches tall and has
weighed, at times,_up to 220 pounds.
His blood type is O. Because.of his
large size, an average-size heart would
be inadequate, so doctors have had
trouble locating a new heart for him.
Thomas Gaidosh resides in
Sutersville, Westmoreland County, and
he worked for Enamel Products and
Plating Company in McKeesport until
his heart condition forced him to retire.
Gaidosh had been suffering from a
virus called Idiapathic Cardiomypathy,
which attacks the heart and causes a
weakening of cardiac muscles.
Gaidosh transferred from West Penn

transplant. His condition worsened un-
til there was no other alternative but to -
replace his heart with the Jarvik-7.

The Board of Trustees at
Presbyterian Hospital endorsed the use
of the Jarvik-7 last July. The FDA per-
mits Presbyterian to conduct ﬁve im-
plants of the artificial heart.
Presbyterian conducted 50 live heart
transplants last year. The artiﬁcial heart
keeps patients _whose hearts cannot
function alive until a suitable donor
heart can be found. The Jarvik-7 can
also be used as a perrnanant life-support
system when necessary.

The doctors who performed the ar-
tificial heart transplant received instruc-
tion from the creator of the Jarvik-7,
Dr. Robert Jarvik, and other profes-
sionals at the University of Utah last
April.

Coffeehouse offers student talent

By Mary Fratis
The Pitt News

The Pitt Program Council is giving
talented students a chance to show off
their entertainment skills. Students
have been offered a chance to perform
in the Pitt Program Council’s Cof-
feehouse programs.

Sharon Shanahan, coordinator of the
PPC coffeehouses, said, “The idea
behind Student Talent Night was to
provide a stage for Pitt’s students to
display their talents.”

Jim Gorman, a member of the group
“Maintenance” which performed last
Thursday, said he decided to be in the
coffeehouse because he’s “looking for
a group that can play together over the
summer. It’s a good way to get reliable
musicians and build up a repertoire
without a risk.”

Joseph Shields, who read his own
prose, said, “I wanted to introduce a
new variable, not just to the cof-

‘ ‘You don ’t have to pay for it, you don ’t have to leave
campus, and Talent Night lets you see the diversity of

Pitt ’s students. ”

—member of the audience

feehouses, but to the collective mind
of the campus. I made an effort to
decondition people in a way. I used a
lot of psychological devices in the
material to produce an affect in the au-
dience.”

Coffeehouses attract students for a
variety of reasons. One student said,
“I’ve been studying all day and I came
to clear my head.” Another person said
he goes to coffeehouses “to study. I
bring my books and enjoy the entertain-
ment and coffee while reading,” he
added. Another student said, “Cof-
feehouses are great because it’s enter-
tainment offered by Pitt. You don’t
have to pay for it, you don’t have to

leave campus, and Student Talent
Night lets you see the diversity of Pitt’s
students.”

This audience appears different from
the original coffeehouse audiences of
the 1960’s. That form of entertainment
attracted mainly beatniks and the social
activists of that generation. The music
was folk, and many performers, such
as James Taylor, began their careers
there. Coffeehouses took place in sim-
ple atmospheres where entertainment,
conversation and, of course, coffee,
were enjoyed. PPC uses the elaborate
William Pitt Union ballroom for its
theatre. Refreshments are served and
the audience sits at tables.

Pitt looks 

bad in loss;
Bowl

  hopes

O

By Randy Miller”

Staff Writer

Annapolis — For the Pitt football
team, Saturday’s 21-7 loss at Navy was
a day of missed opportunities.

The Panthers’ three-game winning
streak not only ended, but bowl game
possibilities now appear dim with a
4-3-1 record and only three games left.

Nothing could go right for Pitt on
that beautiﬁil Saturday afternoon in An-
napolis. They were even on the wrong
side of the ﬁeld. The sun’s bright rays
were in the Panthers’ eyes from begin-
ning to end, making it impossible to see
from the sidelines. Then again, maybe
it was better that way. No Panther
would have wanted to watch the per-
formance his teammates exhibited.

Pitt moved the ball up and down the
ﬁeld, but couldn’t put it in the end
zone.

Pitt drove inside Navy’s 30-yard line
four times, but came away with no
points.

‘ ‘We just handed it to them this after-
noon,” frustrated Pitt coach Foge
Fazio said. “I’m very upset with the
play of our team. We would get inside
their territory and. end up moving
backwards. I don’t know how to ex-
plain it.” .

In the ﬁnal minutes of the second
quarterwith Pitt trailing 14-7, the Pan-
thers twice moved inside Navy’s 30.
The ﬁrst drive ended with 3:06 remain-
ing in the half when Mark Brasco
missed a 46-yard ﬁeld goal attempt.

Pitt forced Navy to punt, though,
with 2:10 remaining. A 49-yard pass
from John Congemi to Dwayne Milloy
moved the ball to the 9-yard line. ‘Pitt
couldn’t punch it in, however. An in-
completion and an intentional ground-
ing penalty left Pitt with a third and
goal from the 30. Linebacker Vince

Annapolis, MD — The tale of the
1985 Pitt football team has been its
roller coaster ride performance.
Through the ﬁrst seven games its
record of 4-2-1 was. evidence of that
fact. Who knows, a play here and a
play there or even a field goal every
now and then, and this team very easi-
ly could be 6-1. I

The course of that ride was derailed,
however, on Saturday at the Navy-
Marine Corps Memorial Stadium. The
derailment ﬁrst started while T eryl
Austin was returning an intercepted
pass 33 yards and suddenly fumbled at
the seven yard line, thus giving the ball
right back to Navy. From then on the
Naval Academy Midshipmen took it
right at Pitt to record the upset.

For the ﬁrst time this season it was

sent during Saturday’s
game at Navy...see page 12.

Pitt’s Steve Apke (left) and Teryl Austin (19) combine to stop Napolean McCallum during Navy’s 21-7 victory

  

over the Panthers on Saturday. Apke was all over the ﬁeld, recording 21 tackles.

McBeth intercepted the third down pass
from Congemi to kill the drive.

Pitt’s defense, which has been vast-
ly improved in the past few games, _
took a few steps backward Saturday.
However, Pitt somewhat contained
Navy’s big gun, Napoleon McCallum.
He rushed for 122 hard—fought yards,
but it took 34 carries. Still, McCallum
showed why he is the third leading all-
purpose rusher in the nation with a 34
yard punt return and three pass recep-
tions for 17 yards.

Surprisingly, it wasn’t a one man ef-
fort for Navy, who upped their record
to 3-4. Byrne threw for 165 yards and
fullback Eric Sauerbrey ripped off a 17

yard run. John McKenna proved
McCallum isn’t their only tailback by
bursting through a big hole for 23
yards. This all came against Pitt’s
rushing defense, which came into the
game yielding just 1.6 yards per
rushing attempt.

“It was a real good team effort,”
McCallum said. “Everyone played
well and did what they were supposed
to do.”

“They did everything right,” Fazio
added. “And we couldn’t do anything
at all.” I

Teryl Austin gave Pitt reason to
cheer in the ﬁrst quarter by setting up
their only touchdown. Austin returned a

Navy punt 74 yards to the Midshipmen
10. Three plays later Congemi hit senior
tight end Bob Lawson in the back of the
end zone with a 3-yard scoring play to
knot the score at seven.

Navy took a‘7-0 lead on the game’s
first drive. McCallum ﬁnished off a 16-
play 85 yard drive with a one yard dive.

Three plays after Pitt tied the game 7-7,
Austin made another key play. Austin
picked off a deﬂected Byrne pass at
Navy’s 43, and raced down the right
sideline to the 10, before fumbling. Navy
recovered the fumble at the seven and im-
mediately drove 93 yards for a
touchdown.

“I wasn’t holding the ball tight,” a de-

Chaz Palla/The Pitt Nes

jected Austin said. “It was a mental er-'
ror. I was thinking about cutting and
someone just popped the ball from my
hands. That was the turning point.”

In the ﬁrst series of downs for.Navy'
in the second half, the defense let another
opportunity go by the boards. Freshman
Burt Grossman sacked Navy quarterback
Bill Byme for a 14-yard loss. The Mid-
shipmen were faced with a third—and-
twenty-four at their own 24.

If Pitt stoped Navy, they would get the
ball in good field position with
momentum.

It wasn’t to be. Split end Troy Saunders
beat Austin on a post pattern for 39 yards.

continued on page 15

the drawing board after Navy loss on Saturday

a total team effort; unfortunately, that
effort was the result of being out-

coached and out-played. Both the of-‘ V

fense and the defense were beaten
throughout the game.

The biggest failure of Pitt’s effort
was the lack of execution, especially
the inability of the offense to score. On
two occasions, Pitt had ﬁrst-and-goal
inside the 10-yard line and got zero
points. Head coach Foge Fazio sums
up the team’s performance, “We got
it handed to us. We didn’t do anything
right. We had no continuity. We
couldn’t move the football when we.
had to. We couldn’t put it in the end
zone and they did everything right.
That’s why the score was 21-7."

It wasn’t so much that Navy did
everything right, Pitt just didn’t do
anything well. The thoughts of corner-

back Teryl Austin best explain the -

team’s ineffectiveness: “Offensively,
we didn’t do anything. We can’t blame
the offense, because the defense didn’t

hold them. We didn’t really play well.
They took it to us.”

Understandably so, Fazio was none
too pleased by the performance either.
“I’m very upset with the play of our
team. It's a combination of everything.
I don’t know how to explain it.”

The Naval Academy players were
also responsible for the game’s out-
come. Statistically, Navy beat Pitt in
nearly every category that counted,
from possession of the ball to total

yards and plays, and most importantly

the score.

All-America Napoleon McCallum
was quite pleased. “We played hard,”
stated McCallum. “It was a real good
team effort today. Everyone played
well and did what they were supposed
to do.” -

For Navy head coach Gary Tranquill
it was very satisfying. “That was a
great effort today, and I’m proud of
those guys, on both sides of the
ball,”stated Tranquill.

The Pitt soccer team

berth...see page 13.

playoff

Fazio certainly knows what Navy did
to his team. “Navy moved the ball very
well. They stuffed it right down our
throats.” As for next week, “We’re
going home for Syracuse and they bet-
ter be ready for them or they’ll get their
heads knocked off that game.”

This setback could mean more than
a loss in the record column; it may af-
fect the team’s performance in the com-
ing weeks. All the improvements the
Pitt team has made thus far were
washed out in one afternoon. Fazio
himself noted,
weren’t sharp at all. Defensively, we
didn.’t play aggressive.” With those
thoughts in mind, a lot of work lies
ahead in preparation for the next game.

It certainly will take everything to
win this week and nobody knows that
better than Fazio himself. “They bet-
ter get their heads screwed on right. in
a hurry or they’ll get them knocked off
against Syracuse.”quipped Fazio.

‘They aren’t exactly words of en-

couragement, but they are an accurate
reading of the team’s current situation.

In order to rebound successfully the’
Panthers must show great character by
playing together if they are to win. This
will be a major test of not only the
team’s character, but also of Fazio’s
ability to regroup and comeback. We
have some youngsters that have a lot
of character and they’ll be ready to play
Syracuse.”

It will take more than character from
some players. A total team effort must
be put forth by everyone or else another
loss like Navy will happen. With a loss,
any hopes of a trip to a bowl game will
also vanish:

“The biggest thing we have to do is
Win,” says senior defensive end Bill
Sapio. “I deﬁnitely feel we can win the
next three games, if we play like we’re
all capable of.”

Before any win becomes a reality,
much more will need to be accom-
plished on the practice ﬁeld this week.

Sport talk

Naval Academy’s success came from scrimmage line domination

Preparation and execution — those
are two big parts of the game of foot-
ball. These made the difference in the
Navy victory over Pitt on Saturday at
Annapolis, Md.‘ Navy head coach Gary
Tranquill had his team as sharp as the
Navy Riﬂe Drill Team that performed
at halftime of the game.

. “That was a great effort today,” said
Tranquill following the game. “I’m
proud of those guys  on both sides
of the ball.”

Both sides of the ball, indeed. Navy
dominated the line of scrimmage the
entire afternoon, something that has not
been done by any of Pitt’s opponents
to date. Pitt’s usually strong defensive
line managed only 29 tackles, and Bill
Sapio and Dennis Atiyeh combined for
16 of those tackles. Divide the remain-
ing 13 tackles up between Walter
Johnson, Bob Buczkowski, Tony
Woods and Jon Carter. Up until this

game, Woods had been averaging over
nine tackles per game. Against Navy,
Woods had three tackles. Buczkowski
had been averaging ﬁve tackles per
game. Against Navy, Buczkowski had
two tackles. What happened to the Pitt
defensive line that had been invincible
in the previous three weeks?

“They thought for sure that they
were going to tear us apart,” said Navy
offensive lineman Chris Castelli.
“They would just give us one move,
and if that didn’t work, they tried to
overpower us.”

Evidently that strategy did not work,
as Navy running back Napolean
McCallum and quarterback Bill Byrne
enjoyed their most satisfying win of the
entire season.

“It was a real good team effort,”
said McCallum, who rushed for 122
yards in the game. “Everyone played
well and did what they were supposed

to do. Everything just fell into place.”

Byrne echoed these thoughts. “That
[Navy] offensive line was doing it all
day. It was their best performance of
the year because this was the most
physical team we played so far this
year,” the senior quarterback said.
Byrne added, “Our offensive line
showed they can be physical right
back.”

Although Byrne was sacked twice,
he did haveenough time to complete
16 of 25 passes for 165 yards. That
complimented the Navy running attack
that chalked up 193 yards rushing.

“We just got it handed to us this
aftemoon,” Pitt head coach_ Foge Fazio
exclaimed. “They did everything right
and we couldn’t do anything at all.”
Fazio added, “I thought we prepared
well for today’s game.”

Maybe, but Navy may have been
more ready. Navy tried some new for-

mations that could have had the Pitt

'defense confused.

“We switched the tight ends around
and ran some guys underneath,”_ex-
plained Tranquill. “I’m sure they
weren’t prepared for some of that stuff,
because they did not see it before from
us.”

Whatever it was, it worked. The
Midshipmen raised their record to 3-4
while the Panthers and their hopes for
a decent bowl bid took a severe blow.
Now Pitt must begin preparations for
a Syracuse team that always seems to
give the Panthers a run for their money.

“We had better be ready for
Syracuse,” warned Fazio, “or we will
get our heads knocked off.”

“We’re just going to have to get
things back together and try it again
next week,” said defensive back Teryl
Austin.

Fortunately for Pitt, the one good

Pitt soccer team downs Redmen,

The Pitt soccer team clinched the
Southern Division of the Big East with
a 1-0 win over St. John’s at Pitt
Stadium. The victory solidified the
Panthers’ hold on a playoff spot in the
Big East championships.

Pitt’s only score came when Todd
Smith tallied his third goal of the year
off a pass from Erim Gude. It was
Gude’s second assist of the year.

Goalie Dave Torrence kept adding to
his shutout record. The senior record-
ed his ninth shutout of the season and
the 22nd of his career at Pitt.

The Panthers are now 4-0 in the Big
East, with an overall record of 10-2-1.
Connecticut is the only other con-
ference team that has clinched a playoff
berth.

The Panthers are coached by Joe
Luxbacher.

stiff competition at Big East finale

The Pitt women’s tennis team gave
it the old college try over the weekend
at the Big East Championships, but the
competition was a little stiff. The Lady
Panthers finished at the bottom of a
nine team field, but walked away with
heads held high.

“All the girls gave it their best,”
head coach George Dieffenbach said.
“They played over their heads the en-
tire weekend. The Big East is a tough
conference. ’ ’

Pitt finished with a total of seven

points. Senior Kris Peckman was the
only member of the squad to win a
match. She beat Laura Bonamo 6-4,
6-4. Peckman managed to place sixth
at the No. 5 singles spot.

“That was the high point of our
weekend at the Big East," said Dief-
fenbach of Peckman’s victory.

Sophomore Stephanie Nelson,
although she did not win a match,
finished fourth at the No. 3 singles
spot. N 0 other Lady Panther placed as
well.

a/$r.oo

I have recently finished reading
Howard Cosell’s new book, "I Never
Played The Game.” In the book,
Cosell divulges his reasoning behind
the fall of the Rozelle Empire.

, It is fact, not opinion, that the NFL
is losing its stranglehold on the
American public. TV ratings have been
plummeting, and there are more and
more empty seats where there once
were capacity crowds at every game.

Why?

Cosell gives an argument that, while
I agree with it,I don’t think is the sole
reason. He cites boredom.

The NFL has become a house of mir-
rors. As you walk through a house of
mirrors at an amusement park, you
become frustrated. You see the same
images every which way you turn. You
pray for something different to help
you escape. Now, going to an amuse-
ment park and experiencing this once
in a while can be fun. But experienc-
ing it every single Sunday afternoon
and Monday night is too much to take.

In the NFL, one player resembles
another, and every team is a mirror of
another team. If someone does
something different, this is big news;

If it used to be the norm. The NFL is at

a loss when it comes to individuality.
As Cosell says, you could substitute
one game for another, and no one
would know the difference.

But in my opinion, this makes up 50
percent of the problem. Think about it:

3 Why is football a popular sport, in

general? Because it’s a tough,
masculine sport. It separates the men
from the boys. But such is not the case
now. We are seeing less and less rough
physical play every week. The NFL is
becoming too wimpy. That’s right,
they’re a bunch of wimps — well, not
all of them. '

What we are seeing more and more

I; of are these cheap-shot artists. Too
A many “assassins.” Any wimp can
‘ cheap-shot someone. We have too

much of this. Whatever happened to
lowering the shoulder and giving some-
one a good shot to the gut? Today we
have too many players pointing the
helmet toward a ball carrier's knee.
Real men don’t have to play dirty to

. intimidate players.

Do you remember a man by the
name of Jack Lambert? Here’s a man
who played the game the way it is sup-
posed to be played. He didn’t resort to
dirty hits. And there was never a more
intimidating player than Lambert. .
Dick Butkus, Nick Buoniconti —
these men were the same. Players like_
these are becoming a rarity. It is
because of players like these that foot-

     

  
    
   
        
     
   

ball became as big as’ it was just a few

that I’il ol’ me could save so

won't get more!

Generics may be fine for paper towels

short years ago. When these players
left the game, so did the rating.

Every time I watch Donnie Shell, it
makes me sad. Shell is a throwback,
a relic. He is the perfect example of the
kind of players that I desire to watch.
He is small in stature, but as far as the
cheap-shot artists go, he is a far big-
ger man than any of them will ever be.
I will never forget the hit that he put
on Earl Cambell, a man substantially
bigger than himself. As he dropped the
shoulder into Campbell’s rib cage,
there went Campbell’s career. He has
never been the same since. And was a
perfectly clean hit.

There are too many players whose
idea of a good game plan is to cheap-
shot the opponent’s best player and take
him out of the game. It’s one thing if
you injure a player with a good, clean
shot. But intentionally trying to maim
him by playing dirty is making yourself
a disgrace to your family, your team
and your sport. _

This may sound crazy. ,In fact, I_
began to doubt my own sanity when
this thought ﬁrst came to mind. But
answer me one question: At the same
time that football is losing its manly
players and picking up these wimps,
who has become the latest hero in
American culture? Answer: John Ram-
bo. Think the two are unrelated? -I
wouldn’t be too sure of that.

People used to look to the NFL for
heroes of bravery, virility, pride and
toughness. Little boys would strut their
stuff in a pick-up game, boasting, “I’m
Jack Lambert!” We aren’t seeing too
much of this anymore. Instead,
everywhere you go, you see these same
kids dressed in army camouﬂage.
Why? Because John Rambo employs
all of the same qualities that a football
player is supposed to employ.

I was impressed by a line uttered in
“Rambo: First Blood Part II” that
probably went unnoticed by more than
half of the people who’ve seen the
movie. It perfectly illustrates the entire
problem. Rambo was heading over to
Vietnam to try and locate some MIAs.
He was told not to engagethe enemy,
but if he had to, he was going to be
given all of these fancy technological
weapons. Rambo said, “I always
thought the brain was the best
weapon.”

'Think about it. Using these
technologically advanced weapons and

trying to maim a player. If this is what ‘

you rely on, and it backﬁres, what hap-
pens? If you rely on these weapons in
combat and they fail, there you are
faced with hand-to-hand combat that
you are unprepared to execute. If you
rely on maiming the opposing players

“Ah <_l_o_ declah I”

The Pitt News, October 28, 1985

;,s\.- r'o..1 ~.,~

By Jim Brueckner

and fail, then you are not prepared to

stop them. Result? In combat, you die.

In the game, you lose.

Admittedly, the two results are
drastically different, but the thinking
is the same: the better trained you are
in the basics, the better off you are.
Those who attempt dramatic destruc-
tion are often the ones who get
destroyed themselves in the end.

Another thing to keep in mind is that
every year approximately 20 to 25
players are killed playing football.
Studies have shown that many of these
players are not being tackled when this
happens but actually are the ones do-
ing the tackling. This comes from try-
ing to tackle with the helmet instead of
the shoulder. Talk about ‘something
backﬁring!

This dirty play has to stop. Most
players probably do not know the risks
that they are taking by cheap-shorting.
Not only are they making the game a
disgrace, but they are risking un-
necessary injury to themselves. In fact,
most of the paralysis victims in foot-
ball have been the tacklers.

As Vince Lombardi said, the game
is made up of blocking and tackling.
Whoever is better at these basics will
win the game.

i These “assassins” have no place in
football. There’s nothing wrong with
intimidation. But as far as hitting goes,
play it rough, not dirty. That’s how
Butkus, Buonoconti, Greene, Lambert
and others have played the game.

Get rid of the wimps!

Runners have
tough weekend

The Pitt cross country teams found
the conﬁnes of Boston’s Franklin Park
a little tough over the weekend. Both
the men and women ﬁnished well down
in a ﬁeld of nine teams in the Big East
Championships.

The men, who were 2-1 entering the
tournament, ﬁnished seventh with a
total of 137 points. Of the top ﬁnishers
in the different events, none wore Pitt
running shorts.

The women did a bit better. The
Lady Panthers managed a sixth-place
ﬁnish. Leading them was Lori Wood,
who placed ﬁfth in the 5,0()0-meter run
with a time of 18:44.

Boston College won the women’s
competition with 35 points, while
Villanova came in second with 56
points.

Providence took the men’s competi-
tion with a total of ‘33 points.
Georgetown ﬁnished second with 79
points. '

The Pitt News, Octobei"i8',‘ l98:5‘

Pitt-Navy-—

continued from page 11

/9': A confident defense was then confused,

wondering how a team like Navy could
move the ball freely on them. Saunders
followed with a endaround for another 25
yards to the Pitt 12. Five plays later
Byrne scored on a one yard sneak giv-
ing Navy a 21-7 lead they would never
relinquish. "
Pitt immediately drove from their 18
to Navy’s 19, but turned the ball over on
downs when a fourth-and-three pass from
Congemi to Lawson was broken up.
“We moved the ball, but could never
get it in the endzone,” Congemi said.
“We looked as if we might get back into

?S. the game, but Navy would counter back

4"’

with the big play to kill us.”

Pitt unleashed one last effort early in
the fourth quarter. Congemi hit freshman
wide receiver Reggie Williams for 26
yards to the Navy seven. Navy again
bent, but didn’t break.

Darnell Stone gained two to the five,
before Charles Gladman was stopped
after a gain of one, setting up a third-and-
goal from the four.

Again it was Navy making the big
play, forcing the Panthers to sink.
Defensive end Eric Fudge forced Con-
gemi out of the pocket and chased him
out of bounds for a nine-yard loss.

Brasco came up wide left on a 30-
yard chip shot, leaving the Panthers
again with nothing but big empty feel-
ings in their stomachs.

When questioned about the offense’s
inability to put the ball in the endzone,

. all Gladman could reply was, “That’s
the same question I was going to ask
you. You had a press box seat. I can’t
figure it out. I just don’t know why we
couldn’t put it in.”

Pitt defensive end Tony Woods put
the loss in perspective, “Maybe we
won’t make it to a major bowl, but we
still have three games to play.”

Pitt has something to prove. They
have been plagued with inconsistency
thus far in the season. At times they
have sparkled, and at times they

.,7.._ looked bad. Saturday the ones who won
' " three consecutive games stayed home.
