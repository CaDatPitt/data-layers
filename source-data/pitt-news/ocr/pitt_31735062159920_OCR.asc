Chest Pledges
Urged To Pay

The Pitt Chest today urged all
students who have pledged money
to the drive to pay their pledges
immediately at the student desk.
Pledges this year exceed all pre-
vious years, but many of them are
not yet paid. So far the actual
cash donations are about the same.

The drive has not yet reached
the schools of Dentistry, Law, and
Nursing or the E and M. When
these schools are reached the cash
donations may also exceed previ-
ous years.

No deﬁnite figures have been re-
leased stating the amount collected
in the drive to date. Student Con-
gress again urges all who have
neither pledged nor donated to do
so while they still have the oppor-
tunity.

Mellon Grant Increases
Fund for Mental Health
Study to $600,000 A

A $250,000 grant from the A. W. Mellon Educational
and Charitable Trust to aid a five year program in preventive
psychiatry at Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic was
announced today by Dr. Rufus H. Fitzgerald, chancellor.

This gift provides $50,000

a year for a ﬁve year period

and is the fourth the University has received from local

foundations.
Other grants effective du

ring this same period are a

$250,000 gift from the Maurice and¢
Laura Falk Foundation. a $75,000‘
grant from the Sarah Mellon
Scaife Foundation, and a $25,000
fund from the Howard Heinz En-
dowment. The state government
contributes $1,600,000 to the re-
search program.

Show of Confidence

“These gifts from private sources
totaling $600,000 are a show of
confidence,” Chancellor Fitzgerald
said.

Dr. William S. Mclillroy. dean
of the School of Medicine, initi-
ated and promoted the plan
which last fall brought three
leading scientists to the Univer-
sity to carry on the medical cen-
ter service emphasizing a pre-
ventive psychiatry for children
and adults.

The annual budget for the
teaching, research, and clinical
program of the Western Psychi-
atric Institute and Clinic has been
set at $1,750,000.

Mental Health Problem

Dr. McEllroy, in speaking of the
program and the recent grants
said, “Mental health is an out-=
standing medical problem. If the
incidence of mental illness is to be
reduced and prevented, it is neces-
sary that greater emphasis be
placed upon teaching and research
and the more intimate integration
of psychiatry with all fields of
medicine.

“This program is planned to ac-
complish that objective."

Dr. Henry W. Brosin, medical
director of the Western Psychiatric
Institute and Clinic; Dr. 1. Arthur
Mirsky, head of the research divi-
sion; and Dr. Benjamin Spock,
professor of child development are
the three specialists heading the
program.

Professor at UC

Before coming to Pittsburgh as
members of the psychiatric team,
Dr. Brosin was professor of psy-
chiatry and head of that division

RALLY SCHEDULED

A victory rally will be held
Monday, Nov. 26 if Pitt beats
Penn State Saturday.

All classes will be dismissed
for the third hour rally from
10:30 to 11:30 p.m.

Dr. H. C. Carlson, head of the men’s health service, has
arranged to bring the Pittsburgh department of public

health’s mobile X-Ray unit here¢

for a four-day visit, Dec. 3, 4, 5,
and 6.

The city’s technicians and
equipment will be. here Monday,
Tuesday and Wednesday from 9:30

to 5:30, and Thursday from 10:30_

to 6:30. These times are tentative.
The unit will be set up in the
bypass hall behind the elevators
on the ‘ground ﬂoor of the Cathe-
dral.
Students who can afford 12 sec-

, ». ds forthe Chest X-Ray test will

have the results, positive or nega-
tive, mailed to them before Christ-
mas vacation begins. No undress-
ing is necessary for the test.

Student Congress will aid the
University’s health service with
publicity and promotion. Tenta-
tive plans are to keep the unit
here two of the four nights to give
evening students an opportunity
to be X—Rayed

     

at the University of Chicago Med-
ical School.

Dr. Benjamin Sp‘ock, authority‘

on child development and preven-
tive mental hygiene, was formerly
with the Mayo Clinic and the Uni-
versity of Minnesota; Dr. Mirsky
was associate professor of experi-
mental medicine in psychiatry at
the University of Cincinnati School
of Medicine and Director of'the
May Institute at Cincinnati.

The land, granted by the Uni-
versity, is located adjacent to the
hospitals in the Medical Center.
Until September, 1949, it was op-
erated by the Department of
Mental Hygiene of the Pennsylva-
nia Department of Welfare as a
part of the mental hospital system
of the state.

Governor’s Request

The University, at the request of
Governor Duff, assumed responsi-
bility for carrying out the pur-
poses for which the institute was
originally built in September, 1949.
With the recent arrival of the spe-
cialists, the five year program of
teaching and research was put into
operation.

Dent School
Gets $8000

The School of Dentistry recent-
ly received two research grants to-
taling $8,000. Dr. Lawrence E.
Van Kirk, dean of the School, an-
nounced receipt of the grants to-
day.

A $5,000 extension grant was
given by the United States Public
Health Service to continue the
School of Dentistry’s Cancer train-
ing project.

The grant is under the direction
of Dr. Norman C. Ochsenhirt, pro-
fessor of maxillo-facial surgery
and anatomy in the dental school,
and is for one year beginning Jan.
1, 1952.

The National Live Stock and
Meat Board gave $3000 for a study
on the “Effect of Meat on Form
and Quality of Teeth.”

Congress Makes No Headway
On Proposed Rival Paper

Student Congress reached
an apparent impasse in its
meeting Monday afternoon
over the proposal of journal-
ism major Jim Furbee for the
establishment of a rival stu-
dent newspaper to The Pitt
News. Furbee had sought
Congress support for the measure.

Last week Congress had tabled
a motion by Sam Shapiro favoring
the two paper idea. On Monday
Larry Adler successfully moved to
take the motion from the table.

Shapiro Supports

Shapiro again spoke for the ven-
ture. Gene Rock repeated his op-
position. Don Milletary called for
discussion only, and said Congress
should not go on record on the
matter.

Jack Burwinkle insisted that
Congress take no action until the
student body was sounded out.

Jim Furbee, who introduced the
controversial proposal, declared,
among other things, the idea to be
ﬁnancially practical. Despite Fur-
bee’s plea, Congress moved once
again to table the motion.

To Back Campaign

Congress also laid plans for
backing a T.B. X-ray campaign;
voted to contribute $10 to defray
the expense of bringing two live
Panthers to Pitt; heard the Chest
drive declared a success; and dis-
cussed the recent battle of pamph-
lets by IF Council and the Inde-
pendents.

Jack Pentercost announced that
train tickets to New York and
Philadelphia on December 19 were
available at reduced rates for those i
who want to go home for Christ—‘

ELINORE STONE

In time like these, it's nice to know where your next
meal is coming from. That's why universities have Tenure
provisions. And Pitt is no exception.

At the annual meeting of the American Association for

University Professors a few weeks:

ago, Dr. W. G. Crouch of the Eng-
lish Department, spoke on the

“Tenure Safeguards at Pitt.”

By definition, tenure means the
in which something is

held. In education, it refers to a
teacher’s right to be guaranteed
employment for a speciﬁed length
of time.
Like Labor Unions

Just as millworkers, miners and
others have unions to protect them,
30 faculty members have tenure as
their safeguard.

The Dian here at Pitt, explained

Dr. Crouch, is based upon a 1940
Statement of Principles on Aca-

demic Freedom and Tenure and
was adopted in 1944.

.Prior to March of that year, ap-
pointments to the faculty of the
University were made for one year
only.

With the inauguration of the
Tenure Plan, the faculty was given
better protection.

I Job Guarantees

Instructors are now guaranteed
their jobs for one year while as-
sistant and associate professors are
signed up for three—year stretches,
which are renewable.

Indeﬁnite tenure is given to full
professors for two reasons. Under
this arrangement, a professor is
able to write and conduct outside
research as he should, free from
economic worries.

Secondly, better educators will
be drawn to a school offering an
attractive tenure plan.

Promotion Slow

“Teaching is very much like
working in a bank,” added Dr.
Crouch. “Promotion is necessarily
slow.”

The plan at Pitt has one very
good provision, in Dr. Crouch’s
Opinion. dealing with a professor’s
Fight Of appeal in case of dis-
missal.

If a teacher is asked to leave be-
cause of unfltting conduct, he has
the right to ask for an open hear-
ing and have an advisor of his
own choosing act as his counsel.

Have you ever felt like being independent for a while?

You know how it is, completely independent—-—no joining,

no pressure, no frat dues, no work, no classes, areal in-
dependence of any interdependence. You just want to sit
in the Tuck Shop and guzzle cokes.

There is a group here at Pitt that feels that way. So,
with an independent tongue in an independent cheek, they
have organized a club to do all these things. Their name
is the Pitt tlndependent Independents.

iThese independents, as their names implies, are the

- most independent of the independents. The independence
B of these independents, we might add, lays bare the heart

of ‘independence itself. Their’s is an independence so in-

T dependent that it depends only upon the independence of

the independents in it.

You want real independence? They have it. Just look
at their motto:
“Pay Nothing
Do Nothing
Get Nothing
Be Nothing.”
Just be independent——in an independent sort of way,
of course. _ . I
_ And, in the same vein, we should like to wish them
an‘ independent sort of godspeed.

For, acting indep, dently, they have given a too-serious

 school a chance to c uckle at itself.

Talenl Here For ~C&G Revival

The Cap and Gown “corpse” is showing
signs of life.

The Pitt News office has been besieged
lately with students waving old programs
and ancient special C&G issues of “The
Panther.” X

Sentiment seems high for revival of the
traditional all-male musical 
revue, with talk about pos-
sibilities for a show next
Spring already making the
rounds. 

What are the problems .:
facing students interested 

  

famous Cap & Gown shows?
They are: (1) Getting ,
money; (2) Rounding up »
talent; ~(3) Gaining student support; (4)
Overcoming opposition by other student
organizations who fear they might suffer.
Problems Solvable
The money problem, most important in
any activity, could be solved several ways.
One suggestion already advanced is to col-
lect cash through patrons and boosters from
former Cap and Gowners, alumni, students,
and business ﬁrms. .
But the best way to solve the money
problem is to put on a good show that peo-
ple will want to see. Pitt always had, and
still has, the kind of talented people neces-
sary for a good show.

even comedians in the student body who

A brand new $4,000,000 Student Union was
dedicated at Ohio State last Saturday, climaxing
the University's building program and its Home-
coming weekend.

The four-story Union has been two years in
construction, and since Oct. 1, students have been
able to use part of the completed facilities. These
include bowling alleys and a
billiard room.

According to the Lantern, the

Why shouldn’t all this talent find an out-‘

‘Best of Rest‘

If music, lyrics and script are too much
for first year Cap and Gowners to handle,
they could use the best parts of some of the
past shows. Faithful members of the Gradu-
ate‘ Cap and Gown Club, who frequently
handled ﬁnancing and script-writing chores,
would be eager to help bring the club back
on campus. W

Student support? It’s already here, wait-
ing to be tapped, judging from the many en-
couraging comments on this series of articles.
Competition was stiff for membership in
Cap and Gown when the club was in its
prime, putting on its hilarious annual revpes.
If tryouts were held this week, indications
are that once again the problem would be a
surplus, not a scarcity, of interested men.

The fourth problem mentioned above,
conﬂict with already-established organiza-
tions, is no problem. A good Cap and Gown
show could be the shot in the arm needed
to pep up tepid interest on and off campus

in entertainment put forth by Pitt students. -

There's no problem that student enthusi-

Isn’t a revival of the Cap and Gown shows,
a gay Pitt tradition for 40 years, a worth-

Disagrees on Education

Editor,
Pitt News ..

This is in regard to the article “Another Angle”
by John Kulamer which appeared in the Pitt
News of November 9, 1951. Being myself a product
of the European system of education about which
Mr. Kulamer speaks, I should like to say that I
agree wholeheartedly with most of his articles, ex-
cept that I would like to draw his and your atten-
tion to the following fallacy in this article.

When Mr.- Kulamer states that “the require-
ment for holding a university post be not only
academic achievement but the ability to draw stu-
dents as well,” it must be borne in mind that
the European student is drawn to that professor in
whose lectures he will learn the most, and he is
rarely repelled by the one who requires a great
deal of work from him. The European student’s
primary objective is the acquisition of knowledge,
‘the degree he gets being incidental to this acquisi-
tion.

Here, on the other hand, the primary objective
of most students seems to be the acquisition of
the degree. Any learning acquired in the process

seems to be rather incidental, and often, appar-
ently, a nuisance.

I could, of course,“ be mistaken. If, however,
this observation holds, then the teacher who
’who



 

It to

 

would be the least obstacle to the degree. This,
in turn, would have to progressively lower the
academic standard instead of raising it, as Mr.
Kulamer seems to feel.

Bestwick, Fisher Hit
Despite Frigid Weather

By DON SCHURMAN

Although Bobby Bestwick clicked on 11 of 17 passing
attempts for a respectable .647 average, he was high in his
praise of his rival aerial artist, West Virginia’s, Gerry Fisher.

Speaking of the benumbing effect of the frigid weather
conditions, Bestwick commented, “It was tought passing out
there today.”

The second-half aerial barrage
of the Mountaineers was instigated
by the half-time advice of line
coach Harold Lahar. Lahar rea-
soned, “We’re 19 points behind, so
we have nothing to lose. Toss that

And Fisher did just that, going

Sigma Chi rolled on to the
IF ﬁnals by outlasting Phi Ep-

game Thursday at Schenley

Trailing 28-20 at half time,~

touchdowns in the third quarter
to clinch the game and the playoﬁﬁ
spot.

Long passes were the hit of the
afternoon, with the Sigs’ Dave

‘with Phi Eps’ Mickey Steiner.

Sigma Chi’s Tom Blosser caught
four of their six touchdown passes,
while Chuck Coffey snagged three
Phi Ep passes in the end zone.

Sports Editor
The Panther football board of strategy was kept plenty
busy over the successful weekend.

On Friday night no less

than four high school foot-

ball games were attended by the Pitt coaches including

an all-star contest at DuBois.
Saturday the University played host to more than 20
western Pennsylvania football products in an effort to induce
these lads to further their educa-G

tion at Pitt.

Timmons Head Scout

End coach Bob Timmons is in
charge of scouting for the Pitts
and it appears he has left no stone
unturned to secure standout ball
players for future Pitt elevens.

At least one member of the .
Pitt coaching family has been
present at a high school game
each week checking on prospects
for future Blue-and-Gold out-
ﬁts.

The reward for this work will
not be realized until the next foot-
ball campaign rolls around, but it
should pay big dividends in the
end.

Fieldhouse Should Help

Speaking of high school pros-
pects and Pitt, the Pitt fieldhouse
should add a lot of weight in coax-
ing high school hoop stars to come
to Pitt.

VVith a losing basketball team

and a cold, dreary Stadium bas-

ketball court staring a high 

school player in the face. it takes
real school spirit to come to Pitt
for court playing.

But now, at least the second
item will be changed and should
help persuade school boy stars to
enroll at Pitt.

As in football, western Pennsyl-
vania produces some ﬁne basket-
ball talent which should never
leave the state.

kept the athletic publicity depart-

Lewis connected to Spangler for
the third Sig score.

The Sigs and the Delts dueled
back and forth over the snowy
ﬁeld for three hectic quarters
while the Big Blue battled to fat-
ten its 6-O ﬁrst period lead.

Lewis was the man who assur-
ed Sigma Chi the IF football title.
He completed three consecutive
passes in the fourth quarter, one
to Blosser, a second to Spangler,
and the third to Spangler for a
TD.

Late in the game DTD averted
a shutout when Bob Halpert heav-
ed a touchdown pass into the arms
of Art Mcsorley. The rangy end

tition, retained the IC4A cham-

Busy Chapel Choir Even

 

Practices on Elevators I

By IRENE ROZAKIS
Each afternoon at 5:30, vis-
itors to Pitt are amazed to dis-
cover that the Cathedral

walls have, instead of the pro-
verbial ears, voices that sing
in four-part harmony.

Actually, the voices that
seem to emanate from the
stone walls belong to the very-
much-alive Heinz M e m o r i al
Chapel Choir. Choir members like
to continue their singing informal-
ly as they ride down in the eleva-
tors after formal rehearsal is
ended.

Belonging to choir involves more
than just singing for fun, how-
ever. The choir has a rigid weekly
schedule which includes four re-
hearsals, ‘a half-hour student
chapel service, an hour-long Sun-
day vesper service, and a 15-min-
ute program on WDTV at 2 p.m.
every Sunday.

Sings for Groups
There are times, too, when the
choir is asked to sing for special
groups like the YMCA and the
evening school students.

With a schedule like that, a
sense of humor is essential, so the
choir has its share of laughs. At a
recent rehearsal the group was
practicing a song in which only the
bass section sings the first phrase.

Not knowing the song, the basses
succeeded in bungling the phrase
which reads “Lost in the Night.”
As they stumbled through the
word “night” a voice from the
tenor section muttered, “I'll say!”

Camp Experiences

Choir camp and the spring con-
cert tour always provide some in-
teresting experiences. At camp,
the group practices ﬁve hours daily
for ﬁve days, but swimming and
beach parties are also part of the
picture when practice is over.

Last year’s spring tour was
nearly spoiled when most of the
choir developed severe ptomaine
poisoning from a creamed chick-
en dinner at a small hotel in
Pennsylvania. To make matters
worse, one of the girls persisted
‘in fainting during each concert.

Members never forget the choir’s
real purpose, however. The re-
ward for long hours of practice
may come, as it did a few years
ago, in an invitation to sing in the
Chautauqua concert series.

Or it may come in the form of a

find this thin and rambling look at

For this is essentially a chron-

this dramatization of the Arthur

a victim of his own doctrine.

Kingsley, who also staged the’
play, has given it movement but
little else. Technically, Darkness
At Noon is a near approach to
stage perfection; but dramatically
it is a weak and shallow harangue.

Robinson Performance Shallow

With. Rubashov lies much of
Darkness At Noon’s strength. It
would be nice to report that Ed-
ward G. Robinson has captured
the disillusionment and frustration
the role requires, but like Rubas-
hov, Mr. Robinson has been away
to the wars too long. No one can
question his sincerity in choosing
this role for his return to the stage;
yet, at best, his performance has
a hollow sound, a voice of brass
that is uneven to the ears and un-
responsive to the emotions. Time
with the role should correct much
of this, but for the moment Rob-
inson is back with Key Largo and
the like, and it is not pleasant to
behold.

Medical School Students
Ha ve Everything bu 1‘ Foot!

By CLARK SUTTON

A medicinal, antiseptic smell stings your nostrils when
you enter the University of Pittsburgh Medical School, but
your ears are not singed with complaints about the facili-
ties. Unlike the pharmacy students on the «Boulevard of
the Allies, the med students believe they are in the land of
milk and honey.

To hear the future doctors tell it, anybody who doesn’t
attend the Pitt med school is not only unfortunate but very
poorly educated. A simple question such as, “What do you
think of the school” will start them off on a long statement,

[designed to convince you that life isn’t worth living unless
you plan to be a doctor.

Future plans for the med school call for a new building
attached to Presbyterian Hospital, but this seems to be of
little concern to the students. They rate the lab facilities
and instructors very high, and they are perfectly content
to stay up on the hill and survey the rest of the University
in lofty comfort.

Work Hard

Happy as they are with their facilities, nothing can
make them say that they don’t work hard. Students are con-
stantly busy making drawings of muscles and nerves and
calmly dissecting ‘a cadaver in the anatomy lab, which closely

resembles a cemetery in atmosphere. At night they claim,

they burn the oil far past midnight.

Heading their list of praises for the school is the atti-
tude taken by the instructors toward their pupils. One
sophomore remarked, “They’re here to help you stay and
to teach you something, not just to see how clever they can
get with tricky quizzes designed to ﬂunk you out.” The

-entire atmosphere at Pennsylvania Hall seems to be one of

congeniality and trust in each other, with an honor system
on tests that “works far better than West Point’s."
Great Expense

, As is the case with most medical schools, it is costly
to educate yourself at Pitt. Lab fees run close to $300 a
year, and with basic tuition, books, breakage deposits, in-
cidental fees, instruments and expenses, it costs the Pitt
med student between $1800 to $2000 a year. Microscopes,
for example, cost in the neighborhood of $300, and no stu-

_ dent can go without one. Despite this high cost of educa-

tion, however, there were no complaints. “We get every
penny’s worth,” is the general comment.

The ﬁrst two years of medical training are spent up on
the hill, then students transfer to the University Medical
Center for their ﬁnal two years of training. The Medical
Center consists of Presbyterian, Eye and Ear, Children’s,

Women’s, Elizabeth Steel Magee, and Municipal hospitals,

Included also are Western Pennsylvania Psychiatric Insti-
tute and Falk Clinic. In these hospitals can be found most
of the ailments the future doctors will come across when
they hang up their shingles.

' No Place To Eat

Their constant singing of the school’s praises, however,
does not always ring sincere. One dark cloud you will find
in this blue sky is a general complaint on lack of eating
facilities. To get a hot meal, the med students have to go
down the hill to the school cafeteria or one of the local
restaurants. Going down is not what hurts, it’s the long
climb back. “After that climb, you’re hungry again when
you get up here.”~ Students usually bring their lunches and

" eat them in the spic and span histology lab.

The honor system referred to earlier is not confined
only to tests. In the histology lab the students leave their
$300 microscope in unlocked drawers along with slides
Whose total value runs into the thousands. There is a box
by the pop cooler where the students drop in their money for
milk and soft drinks. If they dont’ have it then, the put
it in later, and it’s a rare case when the box ends up short

~ of money. ‘ 0

Tough To Get In

Students at the Pitt Medical School paint their life as
a paradise, which, like most paradises, is very difficult to
enter. Only a handful of the some 2,000 annual applicants
make the grade, with the average ﬁrst year class number-
ing 100. Some students will be frank to admit that they had
?‘some fine’ recommendations.” Others, however, -will state
in very emphatic words that they hadn’t any help what-so-
ever, that they just applied and, were accepted. The ﬁrst
year students still haven’t quite gotten over the shock of

their acceptance.
