the
pitt news

In this day of self-determined individuals, fewer
and fewer people find the time to work for nothing. Con-
sidering the quantity and quality of the PittrNews staff,
it is quite obvious that the self-satisfaction received
from doing something with one’s ability and time is no
longer sufficient paymentfor services rendered.

The s raff wants money, credit, and other rewards

. for their time spent on the newspaper. Thefew merit 

scholarships and many pats-on—the-back are heavily
outweighed by ‘lack of time for academic andpsocial en- 
deavors; costs of eating and transportation, and the
constant c,ri.ticism~ the newspaper receives; from all

is areas of the Universityscommunity. 4

Career Seminars

Capt. Ray
Describes
Outsiders

by BOB GING
Staff Writer

Once again the University” has

experienced a losing weekend,

only this time, the Panther team
was not the only group who ended
up on the short end of the score-
board.

This weekend the student body
lost once again to a group known
as “The Outsiders.”

Captain Charles Ray, superin-
tendent of the University Security
Force, described the outsiders’
victory as “just as bad as last

V weekend.

Friday night, at the Circle K
dance, three to five hundred non-
students invaded the Student Un-
ion, precipitating a fight, and lead-
ing again to many violent incidents
against Pitt students. Pittsburgh
Police and Tactical Units were
needed to assist our own security
force in dispersing the mob.

Capt. Ray attributes much of
the trouble to the fact that the Un-
ion was left open to the public, and

that the new ID check policy was -

dropped the day before the real
trouble began. Of this policy, Ray
thought it “one of the most signi-
ficant, forward steps theycould
have made.”

The superintendent feels that

the best way to eliminate the
problems of the past few weeks is

 .»..to control access of the buildings,
. __ thereby eliminating the main

drawing force, something to do
"for free.

According to the Pittsburgh Po-

lice, there were several arrests
made, two which involved conceal-
ed weapons. Roving gangs were
broken up, and the -Tactical and
K-9 squads were instrumental in
keeping violence to a minimum.

Capt. Ray also introduced addi-
tional men, patroling on foot in

the immediate University area.

Looking forward’ to next week-

 end, Ray intends to obtain addi-

tional cooperation from the Pitts-
burgh Police, and says it should

be safe, barring an influx of sev-

The Career Seminars in a co-
operative student-administrative
effort to focus the relevance of
educational preparation on career
selection. The program is design-
ed to bring the student into con-
tact with a wide range of educa-
tional and professional possibil-
ities. Through informal confer-
ences with career “exemplars,”
students gain information about
requirements for entry and suc-
cess in areas of interest to them.

The seminars provide a person-
al vehicle for expanding the in-
dividual student’s capacity to di-
rect himself and clarify his own

‘aspirations. The program, there-

fore, does not serve a placement
or recruitment function. Empha-
sis is upon the student entering
into an educational choice. The in-
formation provided aids in defin-
ing his options.

The Career Seminars were first
presented in February, 1969. This
year an effort has been made to
increase student involvement in
the program. All interested stu-
dents were invited to participate
through campus organizations. As
a result, a student steering com-
mittee was assembled. This com-
mittee will again be working in
conjunction with PESO 8 the Post
Baccalaureate Educational Serv-
ices Office, the University Coun-
seling and Placement Offices and
the Dean of Students Office to co-
ordinate and plan the series.

. To expand the scope and service
value of the seminars, student

APOLOGY

The writers of “Hunt Room
Robbery Thwarted,” which ap-
peared in the Sept. 17 issue
of The Pitt_ News would like to
retract the statement, “Officer
Delany . . . who reportedly
went down for a cup of coffee.”
Delaney was making his rounds
and we would like to apologize
for our error.

representatives from seven other
colleges and universities in the
Pittsburgh area have been invit-
ed to attend. These representa-
tives will enter into the program-
ming phase of the project and
serve in a liaison capacity be-
tween the steering committee and
their respective institutions.

The seminars will be presented
each Wednesday during the month
of October in the SU ballroom.

Schedule for the Seminars
Is as Follows:

October 1—Careers in business,
industry and communications;

October 8—Careers‘ in govern-
ment, law, urban, public and in-
ternational affairs;

October 15—Careers
work;

October 22—Careers in student
personnel, counseling and guid-
ance, theology, education and
related areas;

October 29—Careers in health and
related professions.

INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS

Offering a unique opportun-
ity for students to speak to
State Department officials, the
Duquesne University Forum
Committee in conjunction with
the World Affairs Council of
Pittsburgh will sponsor a sem-
inar on international affairs
Sept. 26 from 2:30 to 5 p.m.
in the Duquesne Room.

The program will feature
Ambassador Maurice M. Bern-
baum; Richard B. Parker, di-
rector, Office of United Arab
Republic Affairs; and Philip H.
Trezise.

Young   lady,
hovv rnany
  diamonds

will you
receive
in your
lifetime?

Will you receive three? Maybe two?
The truth of the matter is that most
women only receive one . . . their
engagement ring. Now. if this is the
case, then the first one should be the
finest. That doesn't necessarily mean
it will cost a fortune. People have a
misconception about the cost of dia-
monds. The trick is to decide how

' much you wish to spend and then

purchase a diamond which. is actual-
ly worth that much. The sure way
to get a fine diamond for the amount
you’ wish to spend is to purchase it
irom',a reputable jeweler . . . one
in whom you can have confidence.

If you can spare fifteen minutes of
your time with us. we can convince
you that we are the jeweler for
you . . . and that all important
diamond purchase.

On Sex Discrimination

. vi The University is one of three local institutions which have been
charged, by the Greater Pittsburgh Chapter of the National Organiza-

 ‘ . tion for Women, Inc. (NOW) with repeated violations of Pittsburgh's
‘ Human Relations Ordinance. .

 

I This law_ forbids discrimination because of one’s sex in housing,
public accommodations and employment. NOW has also filed com-

, plaints of unlawful advertising against the Pittsburgh Press and. the
 Cosmopolitan Employment Agency. A civil rights organization; NOW
. has as its goal the ‘establishment of equal rights and responsibilities for

A  men and women.

The president of the Pittsburgh branch of NOW, Wilma Scott Heide,

‘ has said of the charges. “The Commission has already received com-

plaints from aggrieved individuals, not just with respect to unlawful ad-
vertising practices, but also with respect to retirement plans. salari_es,
etc.

The significance of the present action is that it makes three test
cases. It sets a precedent for other organizations and other com-
plaints. It will also set a precedent for complaints to the Pennsylvania

' Human Relations Commission, because the State Legislature has pass-

7

 

ed a bill (HB 567) in July, 1969, which adds ‘sex’ to the list of categories

,  4 ,,in which it is unlawful to discriminate in employment, housing, and"
_V V public accommodations.” . v

When she was asked whether the ordinance would be enforced.
President Heide responded, “Section 15 specifies that any person who
shall violate the ordinance shall be subject to a f'ine of not more than
$300 or 90 days imprisonment. If the three defendants were punished
for each violation. the total penalty would literally be in the millions of
dollars or hundreds of years in jail.“ — ‘ V

When asked whether the charges against the University were un-
fair, she replied. “The University of Pittsburgh has over 25,000 stu-

 dents and claims to give equal education opportunities to women and

      
      
      
    
   
     
   
    
       
 
 
      
   
    
    

        
 

men. But when it wants a programmer. it advertises in the ‘male’ sec-

'1  Htion; when it wants a key punch operator it advertises in the ‘female’

While traveling in the northof Italy, a man stayed at an

nature. There can be no im-

and a man must have an en-

Last week at this time no one knew who. Carl‘ DePasqua
would name as the starting Panther quarterback for the open-

The Panthers number one tailback. Denn-y Ferris, suffered an
elbow injury in the opener, Sa-
turday. It was another in a long
line of mishaps for the North

ground attack that DePasqua is

  For Starting; Assignment

DePasqua can’t decide _on the
starting berth at the moment.
but does_admit that “right now.
it's Garnett or Cramer. We don’t
have time to experiment.

A couple ‘of full’ “backs were ,

the only, other -backs to see ac-
tion in Saturday’s game. Tony

_Esposito, the starter, was the‘ 

game’s leading rusher with 63

_yards picked up on l2~carries..

he’s still the top_fullback.

Soccer coach Leo Bemis
V.-' is determined to prove that
handicaps can be overcome.
,He realizes that his squad must
 learn to exploit the open spaces
of. a regulation-sized field, and
‘ also win without the aid of the
V top freshmen.

_- The booters practice at Trees
Field which is 30 yardsshorter
 than the fields where they face
. ‘their opponents. In addition, Bem-
.=l_.; is has recently received word from
1; West Chester declaring strong op-
- position to freshmen eligibility.

The short field creates a dif-

in particular. During practice the
ffullbacks tightly guard theirof-
fensive opponents. However, in
game conditions the fullback is
uncertain whether to stick with
his man or sit back and defend
‘against any enemy offensives.

;Bemis also indicated that the
squad isn’t orientated to play-
ing the wings as they should be-
cause of the small practice area._
’.“We must give the ball to the
wings and’ quickly. Then they
(wings) can get the ball back
to position for a good shot,” the
coach stated.

Besides the adjustment to a

izes the punishing bite produc-

Of the‘ four freshmen who
started Saturday’s meet, Dave
Szabat wasn't the only one who
came out in the top ten. Finish-
ing eighth for the men of Ban-
ner was Dave Cheseborogh.

Ed Norris, the Kent State All-
American didn’t run against Pitt

of a strained groin muscle, which
might sideline him for the entire
year. t

do it. '

have someone to spot at halfback.”
Yet, despite his disappointment,
he also mentioned that things
could be worse. “Penn State can’t
use freshmen‘ against 6 of 10
opponents, and they desperately
need them.” '

In the next nine games Bem-
is expects the freshmen to aid
the squad. He mentioned that‘
the Ohio Conference schools have
definitely decided in favor of the
frosh athletes. “It’s the East
Coast schools who_ are fiddling
around,” he said.

"Even if the booters next op-
ponent, West Chester, would
agree to play frosh opponents,
it would be unlikely that the
rookies would play. a prominent

role in the contest. Bemis in-’_

dicated that he‘ practically ig-
nored, the freshmen before the
Bucknell contest. He pointed
for the-opener with only the play-

'ers (varsity) who could parti-

cipate. V _ V

Meanwhile, the squad is pre-.
paring for Saturday’s West

""LeRoy” Claims "Qaack” Fraud
 After Initial Yogi Pick Returns!

Ed "Quack" Conley, following in the footsteps of last year's
yogi champ Art ‘“Bubba” Rosengarten, has been irritating the

yogi contestants.

“Did you see the standings?” asked “Quack” for the 82nd time.

I “I knew it.”

“You knew nothing,” shouted Jerry “LeRoy” Gruebel. “You quack.

“Quack.”’

“LeRoy” spent Sunday evening
convincing the other yogis that
“Quack” was a fraud. He had all
sorts of supporting evidence, like
“Quack’s"‘ sugarless gum and
false brain.

“Does ‘Quack’ really have a
false brain,” asked “Wee Willie”
Naab, who along with “Quack”
picked 13 out of 15 games correct-
ly in the first week of yogi action.

“Well, not really,” replied “Le-
Roy,” a bit shocked by “Wee Wil-
lie’s” gullibility. “He has a real
brain, it’s just not his.”

“Quack, quack,” cried “Quack,” I

tongue-tied.

“Oh shut up,” ordered “Le-
Roy,” who had 12 correct picks.
“I saw you enter the hospital. _You
were in the brain‘ transplant
ward.”

“Yeah,” added Dave “GI” Tier-
nan, who also finished with 12
correct picks. “I saw ‘Quack’
there, too.”

“What are you doing there,”
asked “LeRoy.”

“GI” answered quickly, “Visit-
ing my friends.”

“LeRoy” looked at “GI” and
smiled. Then he looked at “Wee
Willie,” who just,returned from
the drug store. “Wee” bought
cough drops for “Quack.”

“You know something Martha,”
said “LeRoy” in typical Bronxese
English, “if one of us don’t win
this here yogi contest, we’re in
trouble. Them guys is crazy.”

“Don’t worry about me, ‘Le-

despite picking Pitt to beat UCLA.
I know I’ll win. That’s for sure.”

“You guys think you know it
all,” shouted “Heartless.”
“You’re all as bad as Myron
Cope.”

Next week, “Heartless” plans
to be number one. Her only com- ‘
petition is “Quack,” “Wee Wil- '
lie,” “LeRoy,” and,“GI.” The
Panther coaches and players nev-
er were much of winners.

“I do know it all when it comes
to football,” insisted “Quack” in
the “Bubba” style again. “You
can bet your sweet rear end on
that.” I
