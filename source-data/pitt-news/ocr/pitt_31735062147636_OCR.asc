Rushing Season
Ends; Fraternities
Watchfully Wait

Silence Period, Pledging Monday,
Thursday, Finish Mid-Year
Fraternity Social Whirl

If your best friend won’t speak to
you:

If all your new acquaintances look
over your left shoulder when you try
to catch their eye:

If your ping-pong game suddenly
goes sour from lack of practice:

Then you can be certain that
silence period is on.

For fraternity a11d school regula-
tions absolutely prohibit the contact-
ing in any manner of any rushee of
last week. Not only is conversation
between f-raternity members a11d
rushees taboo, but the surreptitious
wink and the accidental collision may
be decreed as misdemeanor, if not
felony.

For men, this period of high sus-
pense and worried whispers will come
to an end at exactly 5 o’clock Thurs-
day afternoon, but the women will
have to carry on for almost a full
week, and are not released until Sat-
urday night. ’

During this period, men who re-
ceived bids will be called into the
office of the dean of men and will be
given the opportunity to accept or
decline invitations to pledge. Mean-
while the women rushees will be
marking ballots and returning them
to the office of the dean of women.
Pledging ceremonies will take place
at the men’s fraternity houses Thurs-
day evening, while the women receive
their ribbons next Sunday, and are
pledged next Monday.

While the list of eligible men for
this mid-semester rushing season has
not been _a_bnormally large, fraternity
men are lobking for a bumper crop
of new pledges, with estimates run-
ning all the way from ﬁve to ten new
men expected by most houses. If
these estimates should prove correct,
however, the ﬁgures would show a
complete reversal of form. Even if
results are comparable to those of
last October, only from 17 to 25 new
freshmen will accept bids, a.n average
of less than two per house.

their rushing programs on Saturday
night, the men after a four-day sea-
son started last Wediiesday, and the
women after a period of three days
during which they were permitted to
rush.

Smith Addresses
Social Scientists

University Of Chicago Professor
Deﬁnes Custom, Gossip, Laws

Talking from the standpoint of the
social scientist and the legislator, Dr.
T, F. Smith, professor of philosophy
at the University of Chicago, address-
ed the Social Science Seminar, Friday,
on “Custom, Gossip, and Legislation.”

Deﬁning gossip and, custom and
showing its effect on legislation, Dr.
Smith spoke with authority as an Illin-
ois State senator. Describing gossip
as the leading factor in life, the
speaker showed how not only law, but
also medicine, religion, and social
science is charged with it.

“Law,” he said, “is the gossip of
counsel before a judge at the expense
of the plaintiff or the defendant.”

his gossip-custom type of legisla-
tion, which is compromise, is much
more desirable, Dr. Smith advocates,
than the coercion practiced by dicta-
tors. t'~ As a loyal supporter of demo-
cratic life, he said, “Coercion as a
social technique, is one of the oldest
customs, It is compromised legislation,
rather, which makes our government,
of the people, by the people, and for
the people.” Dr. Smith bemoaned,
however, the fact that the social sci-
entist of today is of such little use in
the drive for social legislation,

I Whither Supreme Court?

 

Faculty Members Suggest Unanimous Decisions
Of Highest Tribunal, Readjustments
In Constitutional Rulings '

 

Slated to be an important issue in

the coming presidential election, the
status of the Supreme Court of the
United States has already become a
widely debatable topic in present-po-
litical skirmishes.

In line with this debate, members
of the faculty were asked to express
not only their opinions on the subject,
but suggestions as to how the situa-
tion might be made more satisfactory
to the majority of the voters. Some
responded with written statements,
others offered their ideas verbally,
while some few gave views of the sub-
ject but would not be quoted.

The question which was most often
referred to was the power of the Su-
preme Court to over-ride an act of
Congress by a mere majority decision.
Russell A. Dixon, instructor in eco-
nomics, suggested that an amendment
might be added to the Constitution
making a unanimous decision of the
Supreme Court necessary for the
Court to over-rule an act of Congress.
He added, however, that the other bus-
iness of the Court need not come un-
der the ruling of this amendment.

Another suggestion offered by Mr.
Dixon, was to allow Congress to over-
ride the decision of the Supreme
Court by a two-thirds vote similar to
the right of Congress to over-ride the
president’s veto.

To both of these suggestions, E.
Kingman Eberhart, instructor in eco-
nomics, seemed sympathetic. ‘Mr.
Eberhart further pointed out the fact

Navy Department Announces Quota
Plan For Candidates in Aviation

 

A letter received by the Chancellor’s
office from the fourth naval district at
Philadelphia announces that, with
aviation ﬂight training in the Naval
Reserve again authorized, the Naviga-
tion Department of the Navy desires
to enroll a quota of candidates from
the senior classes and alumni of uni-
versities of the country. The candi-

. . . ates will train as aviation cadets.
Both men-"an'd"-women-~-woiind* up  ~- ~ ~~-  - ~ -~ - * V 

Twenty candidatesavill be sel'ec'te‘d'
for the elimination training at the
Naval Reserve Aviation Unit, Navy
Yard, Philadelphia. There will be
ﬁve training classcs of four students
per class. Classes will begin training
about May 15.

The program, which is similar to
that conducted last year, is as fol-
lows:

Candidates selected for training are
enrolled as seamen, second class, V-5,
USNR, and are ordered to active duty
with pay at one of the reserve bases.
Upon completion of one montl1’s train-

, the Naval Reserve.

that “no provision in the Consti-
tution gives the Supreme Court the
power to declare acts of Congress un-
constitutional.” He added to this
statement by saying that such action
on the part of the Supreme Court was
in itself unconstitutional. In conclud-
ing, he said, “Vested economic inter-
ests dictated the adoption of the Con-
stitution with special provisions for
the protection of private property.
Through a system of checks and bal-
ances, the free expression of popular
democracy was curbed.”

Closely connected with this train of
thought suggested by Mr. Dixon is the
statement by Dr; Roger V. Shumate,
instructor in political science. “It is
now established that the Supreme
Court can pass on the constitutional-
ity of acts. As to whether the court
should be permitted to "exercise the
power of judicial review there are two
clear-cut opposing positions. First,
the present position with the court
passing on acts, and second, the es-
tablishment of a system similar to
that of England where Parliament is
the judge of the validity of an act.
Compromises between these two posi-
tions may have some virtues, they
may ease a particular situation but
they do not settle the question. Ulti-
mately I think logic will lead us to
accept one or theother.”

Dr. Marion K. McKay, professor of
economics, issued the following state-
ment: “Anything I may say regard-

ing, the candidates are ordered to
duty at Pensacola, Florida, where
they receive a full year’s training in
ﬂying. Upon graduation, they will be
ordered to active duty with the air-
craft squadron, U. S. Fleet, for a pe-
riod not to exceed three years. At
the end of that period, they will be
eligible for commission as ensigns in

curred by candidates for this train-
ing, prior to being enlisted in the Re-
serve, must be without cost to the
Government.

Applications of qualiﬁed candidates
must be forwarded to the Navy De-
partment ‘for ﬁnal selection '-before
May 15, in order that physical exam-
inations and interviews may be sched-
uled. Applications. which are avail-
able in the Chancellor’s office, should
be made to the Commandant, Fourth
Naval district, Navy Yard, Philadel-
phia_, Pa. '

Pitt Bridge Club
Schedules Three
Faculty Matches

The Pitt Bridge club will meet for
the first time this semester tomorrow
at 2:30 o’clock in Room 801, Cathe-
dral.

According to Leonard Seder, C37,

president, three matches have been
arranged with the faculty bridge
team, the ﬁrst to be played next
Thursday evening, March 5, at the
Faculty Club. The third match will
be played on April 16. Arrangements
for the second encounter have not as
yet been completed.

The faculty team defeated the stu-
dents by a small margin in their only
contest thus far this year, but the en-
tire history of these bridge matches
shows an even break for the series of
six matches in the past three years.

An intercollegiate contest with
Pennsylvania College for Women is
still pending, according to Seder, and
a match will probably be played with
that girls’ school within the next few
weeks.

All old and new members are in-
vited to rejoin the Bridge club for this
semester. There is no charge or
dues, and the club will meet each
Tuesday afternoon at 2:30 o’clock.

Crash Tallies Lives
Of Two Freshmen

Three Other University Students
Injured In Wreck Saturday

Two chairs in freshman class rooms
are vacant today, the result of an
auto crash early Saturday which
claimed the lives of Doris Vogan, C39,
and William McLaughlin, B-A38. Three
other University .students——Irene Ma-
roney, C38, Mary McClain, C39, and
Edwin Ellis, C39—were injured at the
same time, when Ellis’ car hit a
freight trolley on the Ardmore Boule-
var-d, Wilkinsburg.

Miss Vogan, of 1402 Wightman
Street, was an honor scholar from
Taylor Allderdice High School. Mc-
Laughlin, brother of Frances McLaugh-
lin, G, named Alma Mater last year,
lived at 230 North Dithridge Street.
He was a pledge to Pitt Riﬂes, honor-
ary military organization, and a com-
mitteeman for the Military Ball.

Miss Maroney, suffering a fractured
jaw, and Ellis, with a. possible skull
fracture, are in the Columbia hospital
along with Miss McClain and two
others, not of the University, all of
-whom suffered shock.

The accident occurred when the
party of young.folks was returning
from a II-Iomestead night club, where
they had gone to eat following a Cen-
tral Catholic High School Alumni
dance downtown.

One—day service on sums up to $50
is the peculiar type of aid offered by
the College Association loan fund, for
which an open campaign is being
waged by the cabinet of the group
this week.

students considered worthy by the of-
ficers and adviser of the organization,

Only a very young institution, the
fund this year has already handed out
eight loans of $50 or under, and the
necessity of adding to the reserve is»
pressing, according to Paul Keiser,
’36, president of the Association.

Dr. Omar C. Held, personnel assist-
ant to the dean of the College and ad-
viser of the Association, declares that
the CA fund is dedicated to real serv-
ice, and is one of the ﬁnest things in
the University. Between $500‘ and
$600 of Association money has been
placed with needy students in the Col-
lege on short notice. At pres-
ent the reserve is down to less than
$100. Previously in the year, only $18
was on hand.‘ ‘

An Analysis

has been loaned so far this year out
of the $256 on hand in September.
Collection on seine of those loans and
on past loans have brought the cash
on hand up to about $100.

Foreseeing a shortage to meet ex-
pected applications for loans, the cab-
inet has decided to transfer all the re-
ceipts of Friday nigl1t’s College Asso-
ciation Winte1* Formal to the loan
fund. An expected attendance of
more than 300 couples should net a
sizeable proﬁt, bolster the sinking re-
serve.

The dance is scheduled for the I-10-
tel Schenley, with Jimmy Bray’s pop-
ular 10—piece orchestra booked to play
for four hours of dancing. Tickets,
priced at $1 a couple—the lowest for
any University formal in l1istory—
may be purchased up to Friday in the
office of the dean of men, Room 801,
Cathedral, in the office of the College,
Room 205, State Hall, and from mem-
bers of the cabinet.

According to Keiser, the CA dances
are the only campus affairs “with a
purpose,” other than as mere social
gatherings. “The need for a small
loan in a hurry has been encountered
by, hundreds of students,” he asserts,
“and more than 50'sucl_1 students in
the past years have received assist-.
ance, from the College. Association,"

Double Favors
To Feature Ball
Again This Year

Dual favors, combining gifts for
both men and women attending, will
again this year feature the Military
Ball.

The nature of the gifts, special
creations and something entirely new
to campus dances, is being kept secret
by the committee.

In selecting the favors the ten hon-

orary coed cadet captains choose the

gifts for the women. Selection of the
men’s favors, which alone put the
dance on the “must” list, was left en-
tirely up to the soldier boys on the
favors committee.

Announcement of the bands select-
ed to play for the Ball will be made
011 February 28, at the College Asso-
ciation formal.

Four bands, two nationally famous
and two local units, have been signed
for the ball. One will play in each
of the four rooms, on the 17th ﬂoor
of the Vvilliam Penn Hotel.

As has been the custom in the past,
$3 will be the assessment for each
couple. March 20th is the date of the
Ball.

Work in Lingnan
Offered Students

Chinese University Again Offers
Year Of Free Study Abroad

 

Lingnan University in Canton, Chi-
na, is again offering an exchange
scholarship to any student of fresh-
man or sophomore standing who de-
sires to spend his or her sophomore
or junior year in -China and then re-
turn to the University for completion
of the college course.

Full information concerning the
scholarship may be obtained at the
office of N. Robert Seidle, assistant
to the dean of men, Room.8«0‘l,».Ca.the-
dral. Mr. Seidle will arrange for an
interview with a member of the Ling-
nan faculty who is visiting the cam-
pus at present.

“I feel,” says Mr. Seidle, “that it is
a real opportunity for one of our stu-
dents to gain the advantages of
travel, broadening inﬂuence of resi-
dence in China, and a chance in acad-
emic environment.”

An estimate of the approximate cost
from the time of departure from Pitts-
burgh until return to this city would
be $800, including transportation, tui-
tion, living expenses. trip into the in-
terior of China, books, supplies, and
other incidentals.

A similar scholarslnip was offered
last year but was not taken by a Uni-
versity student.

Frank Reich, C36, has been appoint-
ed platform coordinator for the entire
University unit.

Stark reported at the meeting that
the Pitt delegation has grown from 11
members last year, to 35 members
this year. “This remarkable growth,”
Stark added, “has been made possible
by the cooperation of several groups
on campus, particularly the John
Marshall Club, honorary pre-legal fra-
ternity; the George Curtis Club, the
government service student organiza-
tion; and the YMCA. All three groups
have endorsed the project, either of-
ﬁcially or unofficially.”

Christian Tenets
To Be Discussed

Group X, Newly Formed YM-YW
Club Announce Programs

Another of the Group X series gets
under way today during the ﬁfth hour
in the Y Conference Room, Room 801,
Cathedral. Vifilliani ‘W. Mendenhall
will step out of his role as executive
secretary of the University YMCA
and lead the club in its weekly meet-
ings for a period of four weeks.

The program, according to the
chairmen of the group, Chalmers
Brown, Ed37', and Jane Kahler,
Ed37; will feature discussion of,
“Four Principles of Christian Revo-
lution.” This is also the theme of
the newly formed Association Fellow-
ship Club.

The Fellowship group will present
Dr. Garth of the Christ Methodist
Episcopal Church in its ﬁrst meeting
next Wednesday in the Y Conference
Room. The club was formed because
of the interest in Dr. Henry H.
Crane’s addresses last week. Four
major provisions of the Christian Rev-
olution have been chosen as subject
matter for Dr. Garth. They are:

1. Nothing counts but people.

2. All stand and fall together.

3. Ambition is realized through
service.

4. The Cross is a social principle
that is alive today.

Chairmen of the Fellowship As-
sociation Club are Martha Marsh,
Ed36, and Charles Skuce, Jr., C37.

Both groups are sponsored by the
YM-YWCA. All studentslare invited
to attend the meetings of the clubs.

XPULSION of 17 Grove City College students for al-

leged infractions of a “no paddling” regulation serves

to bring out for another a.iring the relative values and
ills of certain forms of hazing in initiations.

While practices of this nature exist in varying degree
among virtually all prep schools and colleges, it is gen-
erally contended that much of the system is on its way
out. Neophytes of today aren’t being called upon to ab-
sorb as much punishment before gaining admission to
this or that society as was the case some years ago.
That much is held to be true.

It is when these practices of hazing are looked upon
in perspective—after being stripped of the somewhat
glamorous setting thrown around them—that some of
these seem just a bit silly. Even a haphazard collec-
tion of viewpoints from fraternity men of various schools
may be_taken as a fairly accurate cross-section of the
worth of it all. After discounting something for en-
thusiastic enlargements in the telling of how many canoe
paddles taped together make a. formidable weapon and
how far across the room the neophyte was knocked by
the blow, it must be admitted that paddli-ng practices
often become nothing more than opportunities for in-
flicting punishment whose only appreciable good comes
from the satisfaction of inﬂi-cting it.

Quite a large majority of the men you may talk to
will insist they themselves make no use of the paddle.
A majority not quite so large will admit that they see no
appreciable good in the paddling system. Much has
been made of the adage, “Spare the 1'05. and 813011 the
child,” but it is doubtful if one could uphold the truth
of “spare the paddle and spoil the pledge."

Of course, there will always be some people in Whose
minds all talk of doing away with such practices be-
comes a. sign of weakness. But it can hardly be called
that when the suggestion of abolition comes from men
who have been through it.

We are given to believe that much of the rough stuff
is being eliminated. In years to come. through the nat-
ural order of change, these societies may look upon their
forebrothers with the same askance with which we re-
gard the Sadist fo ks who ﬁnd a strange satisfaction in
beating each other with clubs. And yet there may be a
group which would have the courage to call a halt right
now; a group whose upperclassmen would be unanimous-
ly willing to cancel their opportunities to inﬂict punish-
ment of the same kind that they received as neophytes.

The Greeks may have a word for a group like that.
If they do, it's as far removed from “sissies” as alpha
is from omega in their alphabet.

Sigma Kappa Phi
Plans For Open House

I-Iold March 6 open, decrees Sig-

ma Kappa Phi, honorary modern
language fraternity. On that day the
fraternity will sponsor an open house
at Heinz House, Martha Marsh, pres-
ident, has announced.
_ The program will consist of offer-
ings by the modern language clubs at
the University. The Italian Club
promises folk dances, songs, a.nd read-
11183. The l‘7‘l'C*llCl1 contingent will pre-
sent ‘cl Play. The Classical Club, com-
posed of Latin students as well as the
only qualified Greek group on cam-
pus, _jo1ns with the Deutschmen in
claiming that their presentation will
be 5! Surprise. Releases aver that the
German boys and girls will make up
a German band.

With the fourth and ﬁfth floor units
of the University library nearing
completion, work is being rushed on
the sixth ﬂoor of the Cathedral, the
last division of the library to be com-
pleted.

The sixth ﬂoor, which will house
the Darlington and Alldred memorial
collections, will also include offices,
and separate reading rooms for men
and women.

The Darlington collection will be
housed in the Belleﬁeld Avenue wing.
Eight alcoves will branch off the cen-
tral room. Separate divisions of the
collection will be placed in these
eight small rooms.

Among the features of the central
room of the Darlington group will be
a rubber-tiled ﬂooring and wood-
veneer, panelled walls. Between the
arches of the alcoves, tall wooden col-
umns will be constructed.

Most of the original furniture, once
housed in the Darlington mansion,
will be used in the wing. The speci-
ﬁcations of the old solid-walnut book-
cases and tables have been taken, and
all the remainder of the furnishings
will be built according to the propor-
tions of the originals.

The other memorial collection, the
Alldred, will be housed in the Forbes
Street side of the ﬂoor. According to
Dresent plans, the room will be more
?f 3 101111859 and Study room than a col-
ection room. The sides of the walls
will be lined with bookcases for the
collection. Chippendale chairs will be
used in conJunction with the study
tables.

Other furnishings will includ

tablet
lounges, frieze

Windsor study chairs with
arms, large leather

‘wing-back chairs, and an unusual tri-

angle group of leather “barrel” chairs.
The walls, near the floor, will be ﬁn-
ished with wood panels. Along the
sides of the room, large leather lounge
chairs, similar to those used in the
fourth ﬂoor rooms, will be scattered.

On the Fifth Avenue side, the wo-
men’s reading room, from which men
will be barred, will be located, As in
most of the other rooms, built-in book-
cases will line the walls. A beamed
ceiling has already been made and,
according to present plans, the ﬂoor
will be covered with rubber tile. The
wood-paneled baseboards of the All-
dred room will be repeated in the wo-
men’s reading room. Lounges, easy
chairs, and reading tables will also
be included in the furnishings.

The men’s reading room, facing
Bigelow Boulevard, is probably the
largest in the sixth-ﬂoor group. Eight
large study tables will form the cen.
ter of the room, with lounges and
easy chairs scattered about. Instead
of the usual rubber-tile composition
floor, a wood ﬂoor will be installed.
Two semi-private rooms branch off
the main, room. These may be used
for individual study, or for meetings
of small groups.

The hall of the sixth ﬂoor will have
an arched ceiling. Here, as in an
rooms, special sound-absorbing plast-
er will be used in the central ceiling
panelling to deaden any unnecessary
noise.

Besides the eight elevators which
are used at the present, four addition-
al lifts will serve the sixth ﬂoor,

Cagers Play Two Important
Conference Tilts This Week

Clash With Temple Owls

Meet Carnegie Tech Tartans On Saturday

After two straight games with non-conference rivals last week,

the Panther basketball team swings

week, faced with a grand chance to climb from their present third-
place positlon all the way up to a tie for first. This is providing the

Panthers get. through both games.

Vtlednesday night Coach Jimmy Usilton brings his ruimer-up
Owl cagers to the Stadium for their return game with the Golden
Three days later, on Saturday evening, the Panthers move
across the hollow to battle the conference leaders, Carnegie Tech.

Cats.

Wednesday At Stadium,

back into league competition this

In previous games with these two':‘
teams this season the Panthers won
one and dropped one. A few weeks
ago, out in Philadelphia, Dr. Carlson’s
boys came from behind to whip the
Temple passers, 48-42, to place them-
selves very much in the running for
the confenence title. Previous to that,
however, the ﬁrst game with the Tar-
tans found the Tech bunch pulling a
last half rally that was good enough
to drop the Panthers, 34 to 29.

Temple comes here Wednesday
night with the idea of putting a crimp
into the Panthers’ plans for a' fourth
league title. Last year the Owls
threw quite a scare into the Pitt boys
when they walloped the Panthers
down East, but the Panthers came
back strong in the late stages of the
schedule to nose out V-‘Vest Virginia
for league honors.

This season the Owls stand a good
chance to wind up in first place.
Usilton has built up a team composed
of mostly veteran players. No fewer
than four of the starting lineup saw
action last year, with several sopho-
mores showing enough ability to add
to the Owls’ strength. Lou Dubin.
Steve Juenger, Ernie Messikomer, and
Ed Casper are the lettermen, while
Don Shields and Jimmy Bloom are the
two sophomore stars. ,

Shields, Dubin Are Threats

In the game with the Panthers,
Shields counted 12 points for the Tem-
ple passers. However, Ted Roderick’s
15-point total and Pete Noon’s ten
markers more than offset the high
scoring Temple star. =Lou Dubin, of
the Owls, also runs wild once in
awhile. In the Temple-Penn State
game Lou tossed in 20 points, almost
enough to win the ball game.

Providing the Panthers are able to
whip the Owls on Wednesday, the
game Saturday night over at Tech
will be one of those so-called “crucial”
games. If the Tartans repeat their
win over the Panther team, they will
be undoubtedly crowned the cham-
pions. If the Panthers win, it will
throw the ﬁrst-place position into a
deadlock, and if both Tech and Pitt
win the remainder of their league
games,_ a playoff will be necessary for
the title. '

Another incentive for both teams

also help untangle the city title stand-
ings, If the Panthers come through
and Tech defeats the Dukes tomorrow
night, the three teams will be stymied

ing the Constitution or the Supreme
Court is of but little moment_ That
the decisions of the court should be
observed no patriotic citizen will ques-
tion. jhut to endorse the position tak-
en by the minority of the judges or

for a different interpretation, or even
to amend the Constitution, should like-‘

crystal clear that such must be the at-
titude of those accustomed to move in
the light of logical reasoning.

“It will be recalled,” he asserted,
“that Lincoln led the forces that disa-
greed with the decision of the Court
in the -Dred Scott case. The efforts
of those forces resulted in the accom-
plishment of the very thing that the
Court had said could not be done, and
ﬁnally culminated in the adoption of
the 13th amendment. As a matter of
cold fact we have refused to regard.
our Constitution as a sacred and in-
ﬂexible steel frame. Instead we have
looked upon it as a plan of govern-
ment capable of readjustment, change
or amendment made advisable or nec-
essary in the light of sweeping and in-
evitable changes in the social and eco-
nomical life of a progressive people.

“This is clearly demonstrated by
the fact that we have amended the
Constitution 21 times. In this connec-
tion the words of Mr. Justice Brandeis
are most signiﬁcant: “There must be
power in the states and nation to re-
mold through experimentation our ec-
onomic practices to meet changing so-

Sophomore Cracks Records
As lrish Defeat Pitt, 43-27

Meir Registe:;25 Points
In Lop-Sided Battle
At South Bend

Johnny Moir, Notre Dame sopho-
more forward, waited until Saturday
night to break a couple of all-time
scoring records, and the Panther
cagers were victims of the Irish lad’s
scoring orgy. Moir’s 25 D0iI1tS almost
equalled the 27 registered by Pitt, and
his teammates added enough more to
send the Panthers down the defeat
trail by a 43-27 decision.

It was Notre Dames second victory
over the Cats this season, but only
their seventh in 17 starts against Pitt.
The triumph also made it 11 in a row
for the lP.amblers, and their 18th vic-
tory in 20 contests.

After the Panthers had opened the
scoring on Loucks’ ﬁeld goal, the
Notre Damers went to work, holding
a lead of 16-10 at the half.

Vlfith Moir popping them in from all
angles, the Irish ﬁve dominated play
in the second half. The Panthers
had trouble with their shots, apparent-
ly suffering a letdown after their bril-
liant victory over Duquesne earlier in
the week.

Bill Jesko had three ﬁeld goals, to
lead the scoring for Pitt, while Moir,
a native Irishman, hit for 12 baskets
and one foul for a grand total of 25
points.

Relayers Beaten By Manhattan;
Kiger Places In 600‘Meters

Coach Olson’s mile relay quartet
scored its third successive second in
as marry “big-time” starts, Saturday
night, placing behind a crack Man-
hattan outﬁt in the NAAU champion-
ships.

Manhattan was clocked in 3:19.’? for
the 1600-meter championship event,
followed closely by Pitt, Holy Cross,
and the New York AC. It was Holy
Cross that tripped the Panthers in
the Millrose games three weeks ago,
but the Olsonmen revenged that set-
back in the National AAU titular
event.

Glenn Cooper, frosh ace, scored a
second in the sixth heat of the 60-
meter run. but failed to place in the
ﬁnals. Dick Ma.son failed to qualify
in his heat of the same event.

Fred Kiger, track captain in 1935
and now affiliated with the New
York Curb Exchange, upset several
favorites including Milton Sancller,
the former champion and world’s rec-
ord holder, to ﬁnish second behind
Eddie O’Brien. Syracuse sensation, as
the record fell for the 600 meters.

Forfeits were handed out by Pitt
in the ‘118-pound and 135-pound
classes due to illness of those two en-
tries. Tomarelli was the lone Pan-
ther to ﬁght on even terms with his
opponent. He lost on a time advan-

Jliionopoly On Local
Swim Titles

By Harry E. Robinson

There's a Lindy who gainetl 1:-lenly
by flying over the w-.1ter. but at Pitt
t.hc-.i‘e’s a. Lindy who is doing a great
job at flying tlirougli the water. Russ
Limllicrg, captain oi‘ the varsity swim-
aing team, is the man.

It all started about 11- years ago at
I'lO.’3l(-‘Fli<:‘-[iii Library pool wliere the
yontlifal L‘?u<lbei'g, who “liked to fool
around in the wafer,” learned to stay

ly developed into a lll‘St class speed

 won his ﬁrst competitive event
at the age of 1:2, a. 25-yard i"recstyl:2

event for boys 12 and under. Five
annu  later he took over the Senior

AIVIA crown in the 220-yard freestyle,
a title he has lield ever since.

At the present time he holds prac-
tically all district indoor and outdoor
titles for free:-style oven‘Ls, l‘dll,9,‘lllf.’,‘
;!:'rom the 50-yard. sprint to the mile
except the 50')-yai'cl indoor freestyle
crown. Tom Locke, a teammate on
the Va sity, dethroned Lindy in this
specialty a few weeks ago. In addition
to his i‘rees'Lyle lionors, he holds the
titles in the 100 and 150-yard back-
stroke events.

Despite the fact that it doesn’t
seem to matter which race he enters.
whicli the records prove, he prefers
the 220 and the backstroke events.
His most recent achievement was suc-
cessfully defending his AMA strang‘.e-
hold on the 100-yard free:-ttyle.

Lindy made his farewell home show-
ing as a Panther natator Saturday in
the Pitt- F & M meet, and if the di--
p oma that he will receive in June
from the School of l?_‘ducation gets
him a‘ job. pronto, he will forsake his
strenuous swimming campaign for
other pursuits.

He is a member of Kappa Phi Kap-
pa, honorary education fraternity, and
‘is majoring in Physical Education.
