Dr. Carlson and Mr. Roy Bost-
wick, chairman of the -Blood_ Pro-
curement committee of the local
Red Cross unit, were particularly
enthusiastic about the spirit with
- which the student body got behind
the blood bank drive.

Dr. Carlson brought out the
point that although the Univer-
sity blood bank drive is over, the
Pittsburgh area has a quota of
two thousand pints of blood a
week to meet. _

The donation of a pint of blood
is perfectly safe. A thorough physi-
cal check-up is given before any
blood is taken. Expert medical care
is given to the donors, and it is rare
that they, suffer any noticeable loss
in strength. Dr. Carlson, who wears
the silver medal that goes with a
third blood donation, last Monday
evening, a few hours after he donat-
ed a pint of his blood, played basket-
ball with the Pitt varsity basket-
ball squad. ,

The University will probably
help raise another blood bank

sometime next spring, Dr. Carlson A

announced.

Two Underdogs Fight It Out Tomorrow,

game.

Our Version

A once proud and mighty Blue and Gold
Panther that is now black and blue from
being pounded by powerhouse football ma-
chines four weeks in a row goes after its sec-
ond win of the season again tomorrow against
Duke’s improving Blue Devils.

Badly crippled and battered from their en-
, counter with Indiana last Saturday, the team

that takes the ﬁeld tomorrow for the Pan-
thers may have to be a combination of regu-
lars and substitutes. Three starters came out
’of last week’s game with injuries that may
keep them on the bench.

Joe Salvucci is ailing with a back injury, Jack
Stetler is hobbling around on a weak ankle, and Frank
Saksa’s shoulder took a beating last Saturday. Also,
end Norb Gestner, who sat out all last week, is prob.
ably ﬁnished for the rest of the season.

Duke comes here pepped up by their 34-0 upset
of Colgate last Saturday. The Blue Devils are not
the same team that easily won last season’s ‘South-

ern Conference title. They have been hit by gradu-
ation, players entering the services, and the loss
of coach Wallace Wade.

However, acting mentor Eddie Cameron, has built
up‘ a squad that is capable of causing no end of
trouble. Despite two successive losses to Wake Forest
and Georgia the Blue Devils were able to comeback
full force last week and trample undefeated Colgate."

The team from Durham is fast and wellbalanced.
Three seniors and eight juniors make up the start-
in geleven giving Duke a fully experienced ﬁrst
team. They range in size from guard Blake Fau-
cette’s 5 feet, nine inches to end Bob Gantt’s 6 feet,

Their Version

Duke Chronicle, Sports Editor - I

Pittsburgh gridiron fans are in for the treat
of their lifetime Saturday when the underdog
Duke Blue Devils come to town ‘for the

seventh and rubber game in the Panther ,

series for they will be seeing one of the ﬁght-
ingest teams ever to come out of the South.

It is not the greatest team ever produced 
on Methodist ﬂats, but it is certainly one of 
the most spirited. Gone are the big names like 

Steve Lach, Eric Tipton, and Ace Parker. _
Replacing them are a ‘bunch of game sopho- 
mores and juniors who never started a ball
game until. this fall. - .

Only three men‘ have returned to the Blue Dukes
from last year’s starting eleven in the Rose Bowl
game. One of these, Captain Jim Smith, will probably
not start due to a knee injury sustained in the Wake,

Forest game while junior Tommy Davis has been '

shifted from tailback to fullback. Senior guard
Tommy Burns is the only one of the trio back in his
old slot——and he was quarterbacking the Durham
Dukes in their ﬁrst two contests this fall. 1

Pitt’s Panthers will probably have their ‘hands
full with the Devil’s revamped backﬁeld featuring _
all sophomores and juniors. Tailback Looping
Buddy Luper, the sophomore sensation, ran and i
passed the heels olf Colgate in last week's 34-0 '
rout of the previously undefeated Red Raiders.
Gordon Carver and ﬂeet Molfat Storer have been
sharing the wingback dutiessince the Duke reor-
ganization following the Wake Forest debacle.

back slots. Pitt fans will remember Jasper Davis-
who performed for Wallace Wade's boys at fullback .

 Steele Gow Discusses Priva te’En terprise,

Big Business And Monopoly Breakdown

By MARTIN LUBOVSKY

Dr.‘ ‘Steele Gow who used to be 

Chancellor Bowman’s assistant and
whonow heads the Falk Foundation
is not typical of the school of
thought to which he belongs.
Though more intelligent, realistic,
and somewhat more disinterested
than the average big business man.
he nevertheless admits when speak-

C ing on economics, “I may be biased,

i having been raised under this sys-
tem.” «

Soft spoken and courteous, Dr.
Gow bears a striking resemblance
to the late Ben G. Graham, former.
Superintendent of Public Schools
In his velvety office he sits behind
a shiny desk and meets those men
called “major-generals of indus-
try.”

In their defense, Dr. Gow began,
“Business people . naturally get
stubborn when attacked. I know
some o‘f them are reactionary, but
many of them are really progressive
when they are talking with you on
the same side of the table. It is be-.
cause they are constantly attacked
and put on the defensive that some
of them say the things they do.”

It is to be noted in this respect
that the almost complete stop-
page of strikes hasnot prevented

‘ «the N.A.M. from agitating for

anti-labor legislation. We dis-
agree with Dr. Gow that “busi-
ness men have not learned to

DB. J. STEELE GOW
the failure is a human one

interpret their thoughts.” We
think it is the thoughts and not
the interpretation that the public.
takes exception to. -

The Doctor believes our hope for
the future lies in lower prices of
goods. “We may have a depression
after the war but we don’t have to.
As technological progress is made
resulting in reduction of costs, if
you turn more over to consumers

Pitt Band Works Hard 

For Applause,

Last Sunday night the Pitt Band
played for the “Fifth Freedom”
Pageant at Forbes Field. They
stole the show.

And you know they’ve been doing

’ a lot of “show-stealing” on Satur-

day afternoons.

There are hours of hard work be-
hind such success——hours of hard
work for the 110 men and their
leaders. This piece-playing and
fancy-formation business is quite
.a process.

Formation ideas, which are ac-

cepted from any player or officer,

“ must first survive criticism, alter-

ation, and revision before ' they

are put into tangible form on the
football ﬁeld. 4

If a formation is selected for use,

‘ imusic must be copied, arranged, or

even composed, in order that
changes in formation and music be
synchronized, and that actual time
on the ﬁeld be used to best advan-
tage.

When Robert L. Arthur, director
of the band, and his staif of arrang-

C ers have copied the music in ﬁnal

form, it must be photostated for
each band member.

The men who spend many hours
copying, arranging and compos-
ing band music are: Robert Mc-
Caughan, E43, chief librarian,
Thomas Mackrell, C44, chief ar-
ranger, G. J. Reilly, BA44, J.
Rowland, C44, W. Schwotzer, BA
43, C. Williams, C44, and W. C.
McClintock, C44.

Next come rehearsals and march-
ing drills. They require a total of
about six hours eachlweek. Several
men are initial in making these re-
hearsals successful. The group in-
cludes: August Decima, E43, gen-
eral manager; Jack Reis, C43, busi-

ness manager; Robert Feick, G44,_

and Jules Levy, C45, assistant
business managers.
The instrument-handling as-
signment belongs to Wayne Nich-

ols, E44, equipment manager,

In return for their eﬁort and time,
bandsmen, together with Arthur
and Lt. John Finnerty, drillmaster,
expect nothing more than the recog-
nition and applau_se they receive at
games. .

Aside from the personal satis-

ing a brief inter-semester vacation

this year, veteran bandsmen and
candidates for membership were

were also conducted and continued

in the form of lower prices, it will
stimulate buying. Business states-
menship can no longer think alone
in terms of production. It must also
think of consumption,” he said.

Again we are ‘forced to dis-
agree, though Dr. Gow is the kind
of person with whom you would
like to agree. In the past, techno-
logical advances have resulted in
greater proﬁts. There is nothing
to lead us to believe that the
economies of technology, which
immediately manifest themselves
in the form of proﬁts, will be sur-
rendered to the consumer. Dr.
Gow thinks that business men
have learned their lesson. We
think their instinct for proﬁt will
dominate any lesson they may
have learned.

He referred several times to the
“free enterprise we enjoypin this
country,” so naturally we asked
about the ever growing monopolies.
Here We ﬁnally agreed, “monopoly
has to be broken down in the in-
terests of business.”

Dr. Gow believes the “system
of private enterprise has the
capacity for fuller employment
than any system with which he

. has conre in contact. The poten-

tialities in our economic system
have not been completely realized,
he thinks. The diﬁiculties are not
inherently bad in our system———
the failure is a human one.

Owl Lists Plans
And Schedules

Senior Photos

Seniors wishing to have their pic— _

tures taken for the 1943 Owl
should use the following procedure,
according to R. Don Lingenfelter,
Owl business manager: Seniors
whose names begin with letters A
to M must buy their Owl from any
senior Owl salesman or at the Owl
oﬂice, 803 Cathedral, before Octo-
ber 31. After their down payment
of $2.00, they should take their re-
ceipts down to Gim_bel’s before
October 31 and have their sitting
anytime that day. There is no spe

cial hour. . -

Seniors_ with last names begin-
ning from N to Z will follow the
same procedure with the exception
that the dates for their payments
and sittings will be from November
1 to 14. All seniors MUST have
their pictures taken before Novem-
ber 15.

All seniors, including those
who graduated this September
and those who expect to gradu-
ate in February or June of 1943
must follow this same procedure.
The absolute deadlines for these
pictures makes it imperative that
seniors fulﬁll the above schedule.
Omission of. their picture will be
the result of negligence on the part
of the individual senior.

‘During this week’s practices coach Charlie Bowser

Saturday, the Bowsermen have been taking a terriﬁc
battering every week. Minnesota and Great Lakes did

the most damage as they overpowered the Panthers.
The game this week is the ﬁfth successive power

for Pitt’s manpower as such is
enough to cope with the hapless
Tartans. '

This revision of the freshman
rule states deﬁnitely that only in
football will freshmen be allowed to
participate and only against teams
that uses freshmen.‘

The frosh question came u-p in

prominence several months ago,
and the Faculty Committee on
Athletics turned down the proposal

due to the feeling that subsidiza-
tion would again rear its head.
But since many universities have
done so, and Pitt only to protect
itself against such schools; and to
make up for its lack of manpower,
have agreed to this new limitation
of the freshman rule.

This rule will be in eﬁect for the

duration of the war, or as long as
football will be playediduring the
war!

    A Heinz House Dietician Cooks

For 72th Floor Activities  

By HARRIET ACKERMAN
“What’s cookin’?” That is the
question you ask before attending
a University luncheon or dinner.
Mrs. Marie Foster, the Aus-
trian cook on the twelfth ﬂoor,
knows the answer—but she won’t
tell.
She has been cooking meals for
the various organizations on cam-

pus for almost 19 years and she '

knows better than to tell. Up until
this year, she cooked at Heinz
House. “It was nice up there,” Mrs.
Foster conﬁded, “but nicer down
here becausevl have no steps t-o
climb. I can walk right out to
Forbes street and take a trolley to

Scalloped potatoes and baked 
ham are Mrs. Foster's specialties. 
But with anywhere from three to.
ten meals to cook each week she
has become an expert on many
dishes.

There is every reason to believe
that the good-tasting, well-ﬂav-_

ored twelfth ﬂoor meals will 0031- :.

claims that she has felt no effects ‘
of the food rationing. There will
be plenty to eat, she promises. VJ’,

unbearable.
