Student’s School Decides Need
For New State—Backed Loans

Individual schools will determine a student’s need‘ for the loans recently made avail-
able by the ‘state for Pennsylvania residents, Thomas R. Fabian, Assista_nt Director of
Student Aid, has explained. . V i .

The -newly appropriated funds, totaling $500,000, will not be given directly in
loans, but rather will be used by the" Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency
(PHEAA) to guarantee student loans from private banks. The PHEAA, which was created _

” ¢by the’State legislature »in 1963, will judge all applications for loan
guarantees. . . .. . _ ,

The planiwas passed at the Stu-

Rankin announced when the

“fully prepared to create the

The" subcommittee, as revised
will consist of Chairman Helen

Vrana; Alice Bilewicz, vice-presi-

be named later.

According to the proposal the
subcommittee will have four func-

1-Review and advise on al-

activities, suggesting priorities
when additional funds are av-
ailable ‘for allocation.

Disappointingly, he dramatized

He feels that “all people desire‘

encountering these survivors, “be-

"Fabian also said that the program’s impact on the University :wil_l- 
not be immediately known sincethere are no- quotas by schools and
the loans will be made on a,“ﬁrst come ﬁrst served basis." _ _
In order to be eligible for ‘a loan the "applicant must be a full .
time undergraduate or graduate student, or a part time graduate '
student with a minimum of sixcredits. Students must have‘
completed one year of college before applying.

The maximum loan is $500 an academic year for part. time stu-
dents and $1,000 an academic year for full time students, with no
student being‘ permitted to borrow a-total of more than $5,000. .

-Therstudent will be required to pay, on a_ quarterly basis, a
simple interest of ﬁve per cent each year he is borrowing "money.

No principal will be paid until six -.months following" the‘
‘completion of studies or six months following the student’s
withdrawal from the University. _ ’

Payments may be extended over a ﬁve year period.

The co—operation of the participating banks makes possible a
lower interest rate and a ‘lower repayment period than is normally  ”

Regardless of age the student who borrows money under the ’
PHEAA program is solely responsible for its repayment.’ A

Rankin Calls - Cost

, Too «Exorhitant

In a written policy statement
on May 14, Dr. Rankin explained
that the cost of modifying exist-.
ing physical facilities for the

handicapped student would be
exorbitant. ’
“Funds for further modiﬁca-

tions of buildings and campus fa-
cilities are not available during
the present or coming ﬁscal year,
but non-'-University funds are be-
ing sought to undertake the low-
ering of sidewalk curbs at a num-
ber of places on the campus if

iapproval can be obtained from

city officials. ,
“The University is faced with
a serious decision as to its abil-
ity to accommodate properly
students whose physical handi-
caps are so great as to serve as
a barrier to achieving their edu-
cational objective at this insti-
tution.” ,

Dr. Alan C. Rankin, Assistant Chancellor of Student" Affairs, is
schedulinga‘ meeting for'June' 9 to discuss the ‘problems of the
handicapped students. For the past two years the Committee on
Handicapped Students has been considering. the available facilities
which require modiﬁcation. ‘

At a student coffee hour last October, when faced wittf the re-
quest to modify curbs, Chancellor Edward H. Litchﬁeld designated
Dr. Rankin to head further investigation. “I wouldn't

Must Be Taken

Members of the Committee on
Handicapped Students agree with
Dr. Rankin that something should
be done to change the physical
plant; but, as yet, they have-
failed to contact the city or ob-

tain “non-University funds.”

Committee member Dr. Doug-
lass S. Thompson, Director of the

Student Health Service, also rec-

ognizes the difﬁculties of the han-
dicapped student on campus. “I
realize that they have a difficult
job moving around here, as op-
posed to the relative ease they
would have at the University of
Illinois” (which, has special fa-
cilities for the handicapped). '

“I hope that more ground build- _

such as the present dorm and
student union facilities.” -

It is amazing how an institution of this sizecan pussyfoot around a problem for

in time.

There is no doubt that shaving

curbs for handicapped students at ten points "

around the University would be quite expensive. Estimates at $750 for each curb
shoots this bill alone up to $7500 not to mention suggestions for changing the Cathe-
dral’s revolving doors into swinging ones or even making another elevator stop on the

second ﬂoor of the building.

But the inaction, even after the Chancellor’s stimulating comment at the Admin-
istrative Coffee Hour in October, seems not to be over a lack in funds, but an indeci-
sion as to where the University should stand on the whole‘ problem of admitting

wheelchair students.

Dr. Alan Rankin’s statement that “th

They can argue that every disabled student isinformed of the limitations of
the campus and that each is invited to tour the grounds to see how he can manage.
But the University has admitted these students and has not discouragedacceptance.

The whole project is expensive, they continue, not only in the initial plans but
‘in the fact that it might snowball into even more demands. The moral commitment

According to observors, the
problem may be the lack of a

Father Martin D’Arcy

Talks on ‘Mask of God’

, By SANDY FOX

“Ambitions and ideals are the masks we wear” said
Father Martin C. D’Arcy, who spoke at the last of three
Pitcairn—Crabbe lectures on religion and contemporary life
‘last Friday at noon in the SU Supper Room.

Father D_’Arcy, Professor of theology at Georgetown
University and past philosophy lecturer at the University
of Oxford, said that deception of the self is “almost the
problemlof the age.”' Deception of the self, he explained,

means taking for granted what we think of ourselves.

Speaking on the ‘.‘Masks. of
God,” he pointed" out that the

same Greek word ipersona is .used_

for “person” and for “mask.” With
a mask, a man acts out his ideals
and trys to be what he wants to
be, thus the deception of the self.
In ancient days adivinity was
believed to reside in masks, and
by wearing a mask, man _felt he
was transformed into this divin-
ity. ‘In the past few centuries,
masks have been worn primar-
ily in comedies or on trivial oc- _
casions. _ ,
Now, however, interest in masks
gias been revived. Men have rea-
ized, he asserted, that man does
not live by bread of reason alone.”
Throughout history masks have
revealed the feelings of the self.
Masks give clues to past civiliza-
tions, Father D’Ar'cy added, and
“show how repetitive and alike
man’s habits are.” .
We “catch man confessing in hi
act.” .
Through the use of masks, man
betrays his secret hope —-—‘ to be
like God and to have his name
written down in history. The ad-
vent of Biblical history, to Chris-
tians, was God in the form of
man. And so Christians have tried
to be like Christ or as Paul said

makes no pretense of its physi-
cal limitations for a handicapped
student. “Before these students
enter the University we say to

manage in this urban setting.’
Dr. Rankin indicated that stu-
dent involvement in this phase
would not be most helpful. “I
think it would be more helpful
if students were kept out of this
and didn’t go traipsing down to
city hall. Students are here to
study and to learn and not have .
their time siphoned off to things.

As a member of the Committee
on Handicapped Students, Dr.
Rankin feels that “we’re just go-
