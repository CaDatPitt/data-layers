On the road Saturday against the
Memphis Tigers, Pitt baseball
third baseman Joe Leonard had
an average game. Well, average
for him. .

And as the Panthers’ record
improved to 5-1 with Sunday’s‘
11-3 win over Toledo, Leonard
continued to assert himself as
the top hitter — not just on his
team, but also in the Big East --
by driving in three runs and scor-
ing twice. \

Leonard’s .487 batting aver-
age ranks fourth in the Big East.

And his 18 RBIs are top in the .

"conference.

“You ‘try to start off hot,”-
Leonard said. “I really don’t
have something I look for [at the
plate]. I just go with what I get
pitched and hit it.”

The 6-foot—5 junior hadn’t
planned to have such a hot
start. ..

The Dawson, Pa., native aver-

aged nearly four RB_Is per game in

Pitt’s three-game series against

Wofford last weekend. He drove

in six runs — four of which with’:
a grand slam —— in the team’s sea-

son-opener, an 18-6 romp over

the Terriers on Feb. 19..

Leonard’s power against Wof- ’

ford started Pitt’s season on the
right foot, but his quality at-bats
have propelled the Panthers to
their torrid start. Leonard said

Q , An article in Friday’s edition, “Pitt approves dorm expansion,” incorrectly described Pitt’s housing guarantee. The University will offer housing to
  7;’ half of the student population after it constructs a new dorm that will house 500 people. The article also incorrectly stated the cost of the Bouquet
Gardens construction project. The site preparation will cost $2.8 million. The Pitt News regrets the errors.

Spying potential of webcams

Michael Macagnone
Senior Staﬂ" Writer

Pitt freshman Sarah Pierotti has
grown skeptical of her MacBook.

She’s been skeptical ever since
last month, when a student accused
Philadelphia area’s Lower Merion
School District of remote accessing
the laptop it gave him and using the
webcam to take photos of him in his
house. Lower Merion officials said
they use the remote access feature
on computers they think have been
lost or stolen, but have since disabled
the feature.

The accusations have created
fears that other softwares —— includ-
ing some given out by Pitt — intend-
ed for security could potentially be
used inappropriately.

So Pierotti has started to wonder
whether she made the right decision
when she bought a computer with a
webcam and then installed Compu-
trace Lojack for Laptops, a program
that will trace her computer if it gets
stolen. '

“I thought it made my laptop
more secure, but now I’m not so
sure,” she said. “It’s really scary that
they might activate that without good
reason.”

Adam Lee, a Pitt computer sci-
ence professor, said students with
webcams probably don’t have to
worry about having someone spy
on them using their webcam.

Officials representing Abso-
lute Software Corp., the ﬁrm that
manufactures Computrace Lojack
for Laptops, said their technology
is different from that used in Lower

Merion. The Lower Merion School
District hasn’t said which program it
used to access the computers it gave
students.

When a laptop is reported lost or
stolen, the next time that laptop con-
nects to the Internet, the tracking
program will send certain informa-
tion out to either the company or in

this case, the school district, Lee said. '

Lee specializes in computer security
and privacy.

“It’s basically [motorvehicle] Lo-
Jack for laptops,” Lee said, referring
to aproduct from the same company
that collects cars’ GPS locations then
reports them to police if they’re sto-
len. ‘ _I ‘

That information could vary from
aGPS location to aphotograph taken
from the webcam, Lee said. _

The Computrace Lojack software,
which Pitt’s Computing Services and
Systems Development office offers
to students, collects the computer’s
GPS location.

“All information on a stolen com-
puter with Lojack for Laptops goes to
the Absolute Theft Recovery Team,
who works with law enforcement
to get the computer back,” Regina
Nisita, an Absolute Software spokes-
woman, said in an e—mail.

No data goes directly to the Uni-
versity or to police. The Absolute
Theft Recovery Team exchanges
e—mails and phone calls with local
police, updating them on the stolen
laptop’s location, she said.

Nisita said the technology recov-
ers 75 percent of stolen laptops.

Christopher McGinley, Lower
Men'on’s superintendent of schools,

said in an e—mail to parents that the
school district had successfully used
its software to return 18 of the 42
laptops lost, stolen or missing in the
2oo9-1o school year.

' That same e—maﬂ said the security
feature “was only used for the narrow
purpose of locating a lost, stolen or
missing laptop. The district never
activated the security feature for any

other purpose or in any other man-

ner whatsoever.”

Lee said that if students receive a
laptop from other people, as the Low-
er Merion students did from their
school district, and don’t know it has
laptop recovery software, there is a
chance someone could access their
computer without their knowing it.

But if students installed the pro-
gram on their own, it would be hard
for someone to activate the program
without their knowing, Lee said.

“Unless you know that program
is on there, you’re sort of out of luck,”
he said.

Protectingyourselffrom abuse by
remote access software is the same as
protectingyour computerin general,
Lee said. Running aﬁrewall, making
sure your network and Internet con-
nection are protected, scarming for
viruses and “don’t install stuff you
don’t know where it came from,” Lee
said, will all help make computers
more secure.

Pitt’s Computing Services and
Systems Development ofﬁce offers
the Computrace Lojack program to
students to help track a lost or stolen
laptop. Only students and the com-
pany providing the software would
be able to access the computer.

Pitt’s Bucldet Brigade initiative, aneffortto collect
personal hygiene items for victims of]anuary’s
earthquake inHaiti, endedyesterday after nearly
a month of collecting donations.

In the end, Pitt students and Oakland resi-
dents shattered expectations by ﬁlling more
than 1,200 buckets with wet wipes, non-liquid
soap, wash, cloths, hand towels, toothpaste,
toothbrushes and combs. The Pittsburgh—based
charity the Brother’s Brother Foundation will
ship these buckets to Haiti this week, where they
will provide aid to people still living in dirty and
dangerous conditions after the earthquake. I

“We ﬁlled over20 shippingpalletswith dona-
tions,” Steve Zupcic, assistant director of'Pitt’s Of-
ﬁce of Community Relations, said. “There were
additional products that couldn’t evenﬁtinallthe
buckets. This effortwas a major success.”

Zupcic said University oﬂicials only expected
to get 500 buckets—worth of donations, butas
February progressed, they had to continually
order more, with the total climbing well over
1,000. 7 A
“We weren’t sure exactly how much Pitt stu-
dents would be able to give,” Zupcic said. “We
ﬁgured to get somewhere around 500, but that
proved to be quite a low guess.”

It is vital that the effort to aid Haiti does not

“These items are desperately needed in Haiti
right now,” Zupcic said. “We’re hoping that any-
one with a pair of crutches lying around will be
able to donate them, ratherthan just lettingthem
sit in a closet and eventually get thrown away.”

Students interested in donating these ma-

Lettertotheeditor

To the Editor,

As I read Evan Burgos’ Feb. 25

column, .“The Wmter Olympics.

have not been kind to Canada and
Canadians,”whichdetailedthefailings
and shame of Canada regarding the,
at the time, yet-to—be-concluded
Olympic games, I immediately began
forming a response in my head to
such premature claims.

As a proud Canadian, I could
not let the article go publicly
unchallenged.

Canada closed the games as the
leading gold medal-scoring nation,
withanamazing14goldmedalsina

wide variety of events such as hockey,
curling, speed skating, ﬁgure skating,
snowboarding and freestyle skiing.
In doing so, it set a world record
for most gold medals won at the

Winter Olympics and won by a host '

country. »

Canada ended in third place for
medals overalL

I see nothing embarrassing about
these standings, and my family,
ﬁiends and counuymen to the north
do not either.

You need to remember that the

_ total population of Canada is less

than that of California, and a medal
count of 26 is extremely signiﬁcant.

We might look big on the map, butwe
are a small country, and to suggest
that Canada could only see the death
of an athlete as a “blemish” tells me
that Burgos _does not know much
about the Canadian people.

The United States performed
incredibly ‘throughout the games
and gave some truly inspiring
performances ——White, Ohno, Miller
and Lysacek in particular come to
mind.

One should remember that the
United States has its superstars, and
so does Canada. The name Kevin
Martin does not mean what it means
up there. Hey, the whole sport of

curling doesn’t mean what it means
up there.

Canada faced disappointment
early on, but it never gave up hope
for shame. It never left its pride
for embarrassment. The Canadian
teams and athletes fought back, and
theirfanswere rightalongwiththem,
providing a rousing, showstopping
performance of“O Canada,” orﬁtting
an inspiring “Go Canada Go!” into a
typically three—beat cheer.

The reputa1:ion of Canada has not
been tarnished. These games have
not been an embarrassment. The
2010Vancouvergames didnot“peter
out with a heavy dose of shame for

O’Canada,” as Burgos predicted.

Canada ended on the highest
possible note, withawininthe highly
anticipated gold medalhockey match
and a spirited closing ceremony.

Canadais,wasandwillremainat

proud nation ﬁill of eating people.

Makeﬁin of us for howwe say “out
and about,” keep callingus “America’s
hat” or sing “Blame Canada” to us
one more time.

But do not dishyourignorance out
on us, and never say we are anything
less than proud to be Canadian.

After performing for 25 years, it’s
safe to say Cherish the Ladies has more
than the luck of the Irish on its side.

Cherish the Ladies is an Irish-
American group of female musicians
and performers that retell and create
folk—style Celtic music.

“The music can be so achingly
gorgeous and sad, and then happy
as it can be one minute later,” Joanie
Madden, the Cherish the Ladies’ ﬂute
and tin whistle player, said. “I don’t

know what it is, but it never ceases to '

amaze us when the audience is not all
Irish people, but an all spectrum of
ethnicities.”

Madden said she’s excited to return
to Pitisburgh after a ﬁve—year hiatus.

Cherish the Ladies will bring four
dancers and an 11-piece band and
feature Pittsburgh dancers from the
Burke-Conroy School of Irish Dance

Madden said she is amazed that
Cherish the Ladies has lasted for 25
years. Its creation followed a sugges-
tion from traditional Irish musician
and scholar Mick Moloney.

“I never thought it would make
it two and a half weeks, let alone 25
years,” Madden said. “Our success is
that we combine music, singing and
dancing and that we have a ball on

Pittsburgh mightbe ground zero forthe,

inevitable zombie invasion, butIVIicro-
soft is already ﬁghting a zombie army
that transcends borders. '

Sure, computer zombies probably
won’t eat: your brain, but they havebe-
come one of the most serious threats
to any computerwith an Internet con-
nection.

A new virus network, the Waledac
botnet, is alarge and formidable enemy
of virus-f'ree computers everywhere.
The spam that the Waledac network
sent can contain scams to secure per-
sonal information and steal identiﬁes.

puters become “zombies” that appear

Microsoft is going after these do-
main names in its recent questagainst

It’s commonlythoughtthat Micro-

want to blame the company for mak-
ing a ﬁindamentally insecure product
and patching those holes only when
someone exploits them.

No matter how much we want to
avoid admitting it, Microsoft has at-
tempted to strike ﬁrst by using the

‘legal system to ﬁght the batﬂe against

security threats. '
Microsoft recently and successfully

attacked a botnet, Waledac, through

the court system. A botnet is a collec-

- tionof“zombie”computersunderthe

inﬂuence of a virus. Like zombies, any
computer could be infected, and we

With this success, Microsoft an-
nounced that it will attempt to attack
otherbotnetswithasimilartactic. Shut-
ting down these botnets would put a
large dentinthepopulation of security

» threats affecting Microsoft Windows

machines.

As a result, Microsoft turned to the
legal system. -

To reduce the inﬂuence and dam-
age ofthe Waledac network, Microsoft
developed a legal tactic of proactively
removing domain names from the
Internet.

With the help ofVeriSign, the com-
panythatregisteredthe domain names,
Microsoftsuccessﬁ1llyhad277domain
names deregistered and shut down.

While the true success ofMicrosoft’s -

legal maneuvering is questioned, Mi-
crosoft declared victory over Waledac
andplanstousesimilarlegalattacks on
other botnets.

' According to a PCW0rld article,
writtenby GreggKeizer and published
Feb. 25, critics ofMicrosolt’s legal tactic
cite the abilities ofwaledac and similar
networksto communicatewithoutthe
registered domains.

Keizer quoted a representative of

To attack these hard-coded ad-

enjoy themselves and come back and bring a
frien .” I

Cherish the Ladies takes its name from an
Irish jig that all of the group’s original members
learned as young women.

The group never set out to create a perfor-
mance act and only thought of truly forming
Cherish the Ladies after Moloney suggested the
members showcase their musical abilities.

‘For hundreds of years, Irish music was
passed man to son, and now it was fathers to
daughters,” Madden said. “We never started out
to have a girl band. In the early days when we
started, people said itwas a marketing ploy [and
thatwe were] sometypeof Celtic Spice Girls. Then
they realized we could. play.”

Madden said she surrounded herselfwith

talented people who she only sees as musicians,
no strings attached. ‘ 
' “Everyone can stand up in [his or her] own
shoes,” she said. “I’m proud of who I have on
stage with me. Everyone is a champion in what
they do.”

In additionto beingtalented, everyonehas a I

shared Irish heritage.

“I grewup in an immigrant household,” Mad-
densaid.“All ofusintheband comefromhomes

where our dads played music. This music was 1

passed down to us by our fathers, lovingly so.”
The Irish folktale music is “a great sense of a
community” for Madden.

“I fell in love with it early on, and my father
was thrilled to have adaughtercartyingthe music

On stage, Cherish the Ladies demonstrates A

its talentby bringing old—style songs to the stage
while composing new songs that only sound
old.

“We compose our tunes, but we always try to
make sure they sound like they’ve been around
for 200 years,” Madden said. “But we also play
some traditional_songs.We always trytomake it
ﬁt andlmake it sound old. That’s the testament
of the nine.”

But while the group performs olden style
music, the reality of the present stays strong.
Madden described Cherish the Ladies as straight-
up lucky.

“Anyonewilltell you music business is notan -

easy business,” Madden said. “While you still do

a craft you love, you need to become a business’

person. We’ve had to overcome stigrnatism of
just beinga girl band.”

Madden said she is “humbled by people en-

joyingus so muc ” and aims to continue to play
and enjoy herselfuntil Cherish the‘ Ladies loses
support.

Only one thing can make a night even more
enjoyable than the chance to perform, Madden
said.

“We’re working towards a standing ovation,”
she said. “We got one every night so far.”

Third baseman powers with bat, shines with glove

Baseball < 1

head coach Joe ]ordano’s imple-

.menting preseason situational
hitting drills improved his offen-
sive skills.

“We do a lot of different situ-
ational hitting and do a lot of
two—strike hitting,” Leonard said.
“I’ve been up with two strikes a
lot this year, and I’ve been able
to get hits.”

Still, Jordano said, Leonard
always had the talent to drive in
runs.

“I remember speciﬁcally see-

« ~ing Joe at a pro-style workout in

Greentree,”jordano said. “He had

great size and great hands, both.

offensively and defensively. I re-
call saying to myself, ‘This guy has
got to be a Pitt Panther.”’
jordano recruited Leonard
out ofConnellsvil1e High School,
where the then—teenager hit above
.400 every season, including dur-
ing a senior year that saw him hit
.500 with six home runs. If that
weren’t enough, he also played

“basketball.

Despite his previous success,
Leonard said he didn’t expect he’d
replicate that prowess at the plate
in college.

“I didn’t think I would,”,he
said. “It feels good.” _

He said that while the results

might be the same, he has ma-
tured since high school.

“I deﬁnitely got a lot stronger,”
Leonard said. “In high school, it’s
a lot of free swinging. Here you
have more of an approach.”

That approach allowed him to
lead the Panthers in hitting as a
freshman with a .335 average.

“He has been rock-solid for us
since he played his ﬁrst game,”
Jordano said.

This year, Leonard stepped
up to ﬁll the void left both on the
ﬁeld and in the clubhouse by out-
going Panther Chris Sedon. The
Detroit Tigers drafted Sedon last
summer in the 10th round of the
MLB draft.

Jordano said that Leonard
leads the team in the clubhouse
just as Sedon did.

“Joe leads by example, as did
Chris,” he said. “Both players are
not very vocal, but both let their
actions speak volumes.’’ ’

In addition to his high bat-
ting average earning him third
in the lineup and ensuing public-
ity, Leonard excels defensively at
third base, Jordano said.

“Defensively, Joe is arguably
one of the best that has ever played
in a Pitt uniform,” jordano said.

“His offense gives him recogni- _

tion, but his defensive play makes
him a complete player.”

The number of RBIs for Leon-
ard reﬂects his teammates’ ability
to get intoscoring position for
the slugger. Senior leadoff hitter
Danny Lopez sits right behind
Leonard in the batting average
column, hitting .393 in pPitt’s six
games this season.

As long as he and his team-
mates keep hitting, Pitt will keep
winning, Leonard said.

“We’re going to be pretty good,”
he said. “We can hit. We can score
a lot of runs, and our pitching’s
been holding up so far.”

But how high can Leonard’s
batting average go?

“I deﬁnitely don’t have a set
average to reach,” Leonard said.
“But I think if I keep doing what I
can, things will take care of them-
selves.”

’ And although nobody expects
him to ﬁnish above .500,]ordano
thinks Leonard has a great season
in him. _

“All I expect from Joe is to be
Joe,” he said. “He is blessed with
great talent, but he does not rest
on his talent alone -— he strives
to be the best. Overall, I believe
he is among the best players in
D-I baseball.”

Lady Panthers gear up for Big East tournament after disappointing regular season.

The Pitt women’s basketball team
needed this win.

Last night’s home game was
a final, desperate gasp for the
Panthers. They wanted a top—25
upset victory to remain in con-

’ tention for an NCAA Tournament
berth.

But Pitt lost its 11th Big East
game, this time to No. 18 St.
]ohn’s, 77-65, putting its streak
of three—straight NCAA Tour-

arnament appearances in serious
jeopardy.

Pitt junior Brittaney Thomas
led all scorers with a career-high
27 points. She also chipped in two
assists and two rebounds.Junior

Chelsea Cole led all players with
16 rebounds and added 11 points
for her eighth double-double on
the year.

The postseason is a whole new season.

When asked what her Panthers
have to do to make a case for an
NCAA Tournament appearance,
head coach Agnus Berenato’s an-
swer was simple.

“We have to run the table,” .

Berenato said, referring to win-
ning every game in the Big East
tournament.

The Panthers travel to Hart-
ford, Conn., Friday for their ﬁrst
Big‘East tournament matchup.

Looking back on a now-
complete regular season, junior
Shayla Scott knows the Panthers
missed many opportunities.

“Hearing the scores today, I

think back to those games and i

how we cou1d’ve easily beat
them,” Scott said. “We have to
change that. The postseason is
a whole new season. We have to
make a change to be successful in
the Big East tournament.”

Cole scored seven points in the
second half, grabbing rebounds
at times to keep the Panthers

close, but Berenato said the Pan-

thers couldn’t get key rebounds
or stops when they needed it.

A‘ “We came intotonight believ-
ing we could win this game,” Be-
renato said. “I thought we were
