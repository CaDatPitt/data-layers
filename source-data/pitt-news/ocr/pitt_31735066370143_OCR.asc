Posvar sets stage
for world meetings

By David Zafris
Staff Writer

Pitt President Wesley Posvar has set
the stage for two world conferences to
be ‘held later this year. Both con-
ferences will address regional industrial
change and science in modern society.

Posvar met with representatives from
the Friedrich Ebert and Konrad
Adenauer foundations in West Ger-
many last month, and the Ebert Foun-
dation has agreed to jointly sponsor a
conference with Pitt concerning
regional industrial economic change.
Posvar said the conference should be
beneﬁcial to both the United States and
West Germany.

“The Rhur Valley is the
center of the traditional

, steel industry in Germany.

And like Pittsburgh, they
are going through many
changes. These con-
ferences will look at areas
going through major ‘in-
dustrial change. ”

,/"Currently, Pitt is conducting a world-

wide study on economic change by
comparing changes in industry in dif-
ferent countries. Posvar said this study
may lead to a major symposium dur-
ing Pitt’s 1987 bicentennial, and he said
he hopes delegations from West Ger-

many, Luxemburg, Great Britain,
France, Japan and China will attend.
He said the Ebert Foundation is “like-
ly" to support it.

Posvar also spoke with repr_esen—
tatives of the Adenauer Foundation
during his 10-day trip, and made plans
to hold a conference with them explor-
ing the role of science in modern socie-
ty. Posvar said the conference will be
sponsored by the University of Pitt-
sburgh, the National Science Founda-
tion and the Konrad Adenauer Foun-
dation. He said it will probably be held
later this year. «

The conference would support Pitt’s
study heai‘ed by Bukhart Holzner,
director of Pitt’s University Center for
International Studies. Posvar said
Holzner is conducting a study explor-

ing therole of science in today’s socie- '

ty, using different sociological and

statistical indicators to analyze his com- '

parisons. Holzner could not be reached
for comment.

Posvar said he also explored oppor-.
tunities for . collaboration in phar— 1

maceutical research, meeting with
scientists of Bayer AG, a German com-
pany that owns Pittsburgh’s Mobay
Chemical Corp. He said Thomas
Detre, senior vice president of Pitt’s
Health Service, has been invited to
meet with Bayer AG ofﬁcials to discuss
further details.

While in West Germany, Posvar at-
tended a conference of world leaders
hosted by West German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl and attended by U.S.
Secretary of Defense Casper Wein-
burger. He said the strategic defense
initiatives and the role of NATO were

V discussed.

Posvar said one of the most challen-
ging meetings on his trip was with
Johannes Rau, the Chief Minister of the
Rhineland.

“I happened to get stuck with Rau
in his office with no translators, and I
found out he doesn’t speak any
English,” he said. “I managed to get
through the conversation, however, by
bringing out my own rusty German."

Xerox gives grant
to Pitt for computers

Xerox Corporation recently
presented Pitt with a grant of more
than $800,000 in computer hardware,
software and service.

The equipment and materials will be
used in the university’s computer and
cognitive sciences instruction and
research programs as well as for the
development of intelligent tutors. In-
telligent tutors are super-sophisticated
computer-based systems that interact
with users and help them develop

agchademic and job skills.

War-tax resisters battle IRS

By Dan’ Bates
News Editor

“We utterly deny all outward wars
-"and strife and ﬁghtings with outward
weapons, for any end or under any
pretense whatsoever. And this is our
testimony to the whole world. ”
Gearge Fox, founder of Quakerism

While most Pittsburgh—area residents
are preparing to file their tax returns,
some Pittsburghers arepreparing to
battle the IRS. These people call
themselves war-tax resisters.

War-tax resisters are protesting the
use of federal tax dollarslin funding the
U.S. military. Nationwide, an
estimated 30,700 people actively pro-
test taxes, according to recent IRS
reports. V

Lately though, the number of tax
resisters has decreased in the Pittsburgh
area, at least according to Warren
Schrum, a spokesman for the IRS. He
claimed that most of the tax-protest
movements thrive out west. However,
he admitted he was unaware of the
growing group of Pittsburgh resisters
known as the Fund’ For Lifers.

The Fund For Life was created about
six years ago by local tax resisters,
most of whom belonged to the
Religious Society of Friends (Quakers),

The Quakers are pacifists who detest
war and violence.

Members of the group refuse to pay
the portion of their income taxes which
they believe goes toward the military.
They take that money and either donate
it to the fund or just place it in the fund
temporarily, until they need it. The
money is kept in a local bank account,
presently safe from the IRS.

Interest accumulated from the ac-
count is lent to local organizations such

“We ’re not saying we
are opposed to taxation.
We ’re opposed to the
enormous amounts of
money being spent by the
military. ”

-— Tim Sperry

as the North Side Food Co—op in Man-
chester and the Hunger Action
Coalition.

Tim Sperry; a founding member of
the Fund For Life, said he favored tax
resistance because “as a pacifist, I can-
not, in good conscience, pay for war. ’ ’
However, he admitted he began
resisting only when he owed the IRS
U199?!» . . . . . . . . . . . . ’

“I started thinking about war-tax‘

resistance,” Sperry said. “Then one

: year, I was in that fortunate situation
where I owed them [the IRS] money. .

That was the most logical time to
start.” ‘

Sperry said his philosophy is “to
resist as far as I can.” And to those
who succumb to pressure, he added,
“Nobody scorns them for buckling
under pressure. That’s the beauty of
it.”

A In an effort: to gain support, Sperry
conducts periodic workshops to teach
people the techniques of tax resistance.
At one workshop held at the Friends
Meeting House in Shadyside, Sperry

explained, in detail, the practice of

war-tax resistance."

“First, you must remember it’s
illegal,” Sperry said. “Doing tax
resistance is against the law, and you
must understand there are possible con-
sequences.”

He explained that war-tax resistance
is merely a form of nonviolent dis-
obedience that is performed by in-
dividuals in the privacy of their own
homes. However, he encouraged peo-
ple to join resistance organizations such
as the Fund For Life. “You should do
it as individuals, but then come together
for solidarity.” -

Libya ﬁnally condemns terrorist acts

Libya — Libya abruptly reversed its
position today by condemning last
week’s terrorist attacks at the Rome
and Vienna airports. Libyan leader
Moammar Khadafy said Wednesday
that he approved of the attacks that left
19 people dead and more than 110
wounded. Now, with U.S. forces in the
Mediterranean within striking distance
of Libya, there has been an apparent
desire to fend off any retaliatory
strikes. The Secretary for the Peoples’
Bureau for Foreign Liaison told
reporters in Tripoli that Libya had
nothing to do with the attacks in Rome
and Vienna.

Navy prepares
for possible attack

WASHINGTON — Pentagon
sources said that U.S. naval forces are
being moved to North Africa in case
President Reagan decides to strike at
Arab terrorist bases in Libya. Sources
said that the U.S.S. Coral Sea has
sailed from Italy, naval planes have
ﬂown to Sicily from Washington state,
and in Norfolk, Va., a battleship has
been told to prepare to sail suddenly.
Reagan said that any ship movements
are normal maneuvers and they are not
“out of the ordinary.” -

Shuttle finally
set for launch

Florida — All systems are go for to-
day’s launch of the shuttle Columbia.
NASA engineers and seven astronauts
said that they hope that this time will
be the charm when they send the refur-
bished shuttle on its first mission in
more than two years. Two previous
launch ‘attempts were scuttled last
month due to electrical problems.

The countdown began on time
yesterday morning at Cape Canaveral,

Fla., and forecasters are predicting -

favorable weather conditions at launch
time. Astronaut Robert Gibson said,
“We’re looking forward now to being
the first ﬂight of ’86 instead of the last
ﬂight of ’85.” The shuttle mission is
the first of 15 ﬂights scheduled for
1986.

  West Europe
Negligent

It is indeed unfortunate that a number of Western
European countries have failed to impose even the
most nominal of economic and political sanctions
against Libya for its support of terrorist groups and
activities. West Germany, Italy, Austria, France
and several other Western European nations have
been reluctant to initiate punitive measures against

- Libya because of the economic advantages from

mutually beneficial trade relations.

Americans have often been criticized for
cultivating a culture of crass materialism. Yet, what
of the Western Europeans? In this instance, one
must question the integrity of any nation that for-

- sakes its moral duty in exchange for economic gain.

Moreover, the contributions of trade with Libya to
the health of the economies of these Western Euro-
pean nations are so small that to forego them would
do no noticeable harm. At any rate, even if the
profits realizedlby these nations from trade with
Libya were abundant (which is far from the case),
they must not interfere with justice.

Libya’s actions have been criminal and, as such,
demand punishment. Yet the Western European na-
tions, by refusing to take punitive measures, are
allowing Libya to display (with relative impunity)
nothing if not utter contempt for the principles of
international "law and the ethics on which they are
founded. American sanctions alone can have little
impact on Libyan policybecause economic ties are
already few and weak. But Libya’s ties with a
number of the Western European nations are quite
extensive. Thus, should the Western Europeans

choose to make Col. Qaddafi fear for the future of

current trade relations and the benefits derived
thereof, there is a good chance that he would begin
to see the prudence of acting with a good deal more
restraint in the future. Sadly, however, the Western
Europeans are, at this point, neglecting their respon-
sibility in this matter and, by their inaction, en-

' couraging further lawlessness.

Christianity
Defended

I would like to address a few words
to Kevin Bold.
Dear Mr. Bold,

About that column of yours, “The
World’s Tragedy.” You’re quite a fun-
ny guy. But that's OK. God has a sense
of humor.

I must admit, though, your article
rattled the foundations of my 22-year
association with Catholicism, but ques-
tions are natural for people of any faith,
and fortunately. (for me. at least). faith
usually prevails.

The tone of your column seemed to
be addressing the hypocrites of Chris-
tianity rather than Christianity itself. I
mean, that’s quite a battle for one man
to take on.

Your respect for the individual is ad-
mirable. In addition to the individual.
I also respect the “paranoid,
schizophrenic  who changed careers
because nobody worships carpenters,”
despite the fact that I have never met
him!

Linda Ryan
CGS

After reading Kevin Bold’s column
“The World’s Tragedy” in‘ the Dec.
9 issue of The Pitt News, I was im-
pressed by his brand of self-centered
humanism (“  there is someone in
your life worth caring about  go look
in the mirror.“). However. if he plans
on comparing his style of humanism to
Christianity, he should do his
homework just a bit better. Instead of
arguing with Kevin about the validity
of the virgin birth or the resurrection.
I would like to focus on the fallacies
in Mr. Bold‘s supporting points that at-
tempt to “provc" ‘just how terrible
Christianity is.

First, I‘m sure that Mr. Bold would
be comfortable with the definition of
a Christian as one who follows Christ's

"teachings. Following in the same line
of thought. any actions that contradict
those teachings should not be attributed
to Christianity (religious fanaticism:
yes; Christianity: no).

Mr. Bold supported his point by in-
fonning us all of.the horrible things that
were done in the name of Christianity
(lnquisitions, witch—hunts, anti-
Semitism. etc.'). I challenge Mr. Bold

to support these actions with Christ’s .

teachings. It can’t be done. Instead.
Christ- tells us in the Sermon on the
Mount "love your enemies. and pray
for those who persecute you." In
another section. Mr. Bold tells us that
Christianity looks on property. wealth.
and capitalism as evils. I would really
enjoy hearing how he gets suppoitfrom
the Bible for today‘s economy. Also.

in response to Mr. Bold’s interpreta-
tion of basic Christian philosophy
(“Thou shalt be a doormat unto thy
neighbor’s feet”), I refer him to the ac-
count of the cleansing of the temple
(Matt. 21:12-17). Christ is pictured
here as an angry man who is correcting
a great evil, not as a submissive wimp,
like Mr. Bold’s article would want us
to believe. Finally, I notice that Mr.
Bold was able to find a bit of scripture

but it’s quite clear that he’s not as well-
versed in the Good Book as he pretends
to be. _

I can‘t ask Kevin to take the same
view of Christ as I do. However, it
would be nice if he would at least
research Christ’s teachings before
trying to convince me that I’ve been

High Praise

I want to congratulate The Pitt News
for the worthwhile article, “Christmas
Tradition is Lost to Economic Need,”
in the Dec. 9 issue. The importance of

A the article does not rest in the fact that
I agreed wholeheartedly with most of
it, but in the fact that its meaning,
although disputed by some, is needed
to alert students especially that our
values may be coming distorted in this
topsy-turvy world. Both the paper and
the student staff writer have brought a
timely topic to their reading public as
a challenge to their thinking.

As a retired educator, I always take
the opportunity to pick up The Pitt
News since I frequent Hillman Library
a great deal. Several other recent ar-
ticles have been a credit to your news
policy because they have transcended
the material world of the mundane
trivia to challenge the minds of those
seeking an education for life in a cruel
world.

1 Pro—Life  

Samuel Flesher raises a number of
points in his Dec. 9 letter on the Pro-
Life movement.

He objects to the term "pro—life."
In a nutshell, the abortion rights
philosophy holds that human life. per
se. has no inherent value at all and can
be legally killed. while young, for any
reason. The opposing view holds that
all human life. even while young. has
inherent value and should be_protected
by law. It seems to me that the latter
View is aptly named "pro—life."

, His attempt to link the Pro-Life
movement with promoting juvenile
smoking, environmental pollution, and
abuses of capitalism is unsupported and
deserves no reply. The national Pro-
Life movement has its hands full with
abortion, infanticide, and euthanasia,
and is not involved in other issues.

Incredibly, Mr. Flesher accuses pro-
lifers of unconcern for the unfortunate
among us. This presumes, on a private
scale, an intimate knowledge of the
personal expenditures in time, money,
labor, counseling, human companion-
ship, and other forms on the part of
millions of pro-lifers, knowledge which
Mr. Flesher cannot possibly have. On.
a more public" scale, apparently Mr.
Flesher needs to be reminded of the
pro—life advocate Mother Theresa of
Calcutta, or the pro—life Catholic‘
Charities, or the emerging network of
pro—life Mom’s Houses (including one
here in Pittsburgh), or the pro—life
Covenant House in New York City, or,
numerous other charitable and social
services supported solely or in large"
part by people who feel every human
life is valuable. .

Finally, Mr. Flesher’s letter serves’
as an unfortunate case in point for my
earlier letter. There I complained that
advocates of legal abortion do not
honestly and squarely address the pur-'
poseful destruction of innocent human
life necessitated by every abortion, and
that they angrily object to any attention
being turned to this monumentally
crucial issue. Nowhere in his letter
does Mr. Flesher address the human
lives directly attacked by the abortion
rights movement; instead, he dismisses
discussion of this issue as “in very bad
taste.”

If mere discussions or cartoons of
abortion victims are offensive, how
much more so are the abortions
themselves?

Tobacco Industry Evades Culpability For Consequences of “Killer Weed”

WASHINGTON — Back when I
was a crack claims adjuster for a ma-
jor insurance company, I was taught
the most amazing legal concept. It is
called “contributory negligence” and
it applies to situations in which neither
party is totally wrong nor totally right
but, as life often has it, somewhere in
between. That concept, John M_.
Galbraith would have said, about
describes his relationship with R.J.
Reynolds. It’s cigarettes that killed
him, but he had to light them.

How that common-sense observation
escaped the Santa Barbara, Calif. , jury
that found cigarettes nonaddictive and
therefore not liable for the death of
Galbraith is something I, as a former
smoker, could never explain. Anyone
who has ever smoked knows cigarettes
are addictive and, as the pack now tells
you, extremely bad for your health.
Among other things, they can give you
cancer.

But the jury listened to the slick
words of Reynolds‘ lawyer, Thomas
Workman, who said that Galbraith
smoked because he “loved it. He lik-
ed the taste. The evidence has shown
he could -[have] quit when he wanted
to.” The evidence also showed that
Galbraith was sneaking smokes as he

- lay dying of lung cancer and heart and

respiratory problems. Evidence or no
evidence, it doesn’t take a visit from
Nancy Reagan to certify a person as an
addict.

Still, Workman (a smoker of Camel
Lights) has a point. Even though
cigarettes are both unhealthy and ad-
dictive, and even though — required
warnings aside — they are advertised
as neither, it was still within Galbraith‘s
power to quit the weed and stop con-
tributing to his own death. The task is
not easy, but it can be done. As the
old joke goes, I have done it several
times — the last time, I hope, for good.

Galbraith is dead and it is neither
fruitful nor, probably, in good taste
to chastise him for lacking will power.
But what about R.J. Reynolds? The
men who run that company must know
that cigarettes are both addictive and
unhealthy and yet they do not hesitate
to say otherwise. The company simp-
Iy washes its hands of the consequences
of what it manufactures, endorsing the
ethical values parodied by Tom Lehrer
in his song about one-time Nazi rocket
scientist Werner von Braun: “ ‘Once
the rockets go up, who cares where
they come down? It’s not my depart-
ment,’ says Werner von Braun.”

But it ought to be R.J. Reynolds’
department and sooner or later the
courts will say it is. The principle that
cigarette makers are at least partially
responsible for the bad health of
smokers is not that different than the
one the New Jersey Supreme Court ap-
plied to the hosts of a particular legal-

Time Marches Forward, But Some Things Never Change

Well, the New Year’s celebration is
over. Another year has come andgone.
1986. Can you believe it? Time certain-
Iy does ﬂy. It seems like only last year
I was beginning my college career.
Come this spring, hopefully, I’ll be
putting on a cap and gown and prepar-
ing to begin my life’s work.

Things around here certainly have
changed since I was a wide-eyed
freshman. The year was 1982 and Dan
Marino was still the quarterback for the
Pitt football team, and Foge Fazio was
celebrating his ﬁrst year as head coach
with a trip to Dallas and the Cotton
Bowl. The Panther basketball team was
embarking on its initial odyssey
through the fearsome Big East Con-
ference. They were readying to face
such players as sophomores Patrick
Ewing of — Georgetown and Chris
Mullin of St. John’s.

Words like apartheidand divestment
could only be found in the dictionaries
at Hillman Library. The William Pitt
Union was still undergoing its facelift.
The Original Hot Dog shop had only
one room, and there were still beer
blasts on Thursday nights at the Keg.
There was even a White Tower (for
those of you who are unfamiliar, the
White Tower is a diner and not an ivory
castle) where Rax now stands. Indeed,
things certainly have changed.

Some things, though, will never
change as long as the University of
Pittsburgh has its campus in Oakland.
Oh, they may seem a bit different. The
names and faces are sure to change but,
no matter how many New Year’s Eves
come and go or how many Kegs or
White Towers fold, some things at Pitt
will always be the same:

— The food in the Towers Cafeteria.

Iy drunk guest. After he had consumed
about 13 scotches, his hosts escorted
him to his car and watched as he drove
off — not into the sunset, but into
another car.. With the court's blessing,
the other driver sued everyone in sight
— including the erstwhile hosts. In the
end, she recovered from them all.
The New Jersey ruling really just
proclaimed common sense. Anyone
who serves someone 13 scotches and
allows that person to drive off has a fair
idea of what the consequences could
be. It is the same with the tobacco com-
panies —— or it ought to be. They sure-
Iy know by now what can happen to
someone who smokes for a lifetime.
And yet, they not only continue to
manufacture their product, they adver-
tise it in such a way as to rebut the
message that smoking is unhealthy. In
this way, they contribute to the deaths
of many people — maybe not
Galbraith, whose death may not have

For those of you who have had the
“pleasure” of dining at the cafeteria
for four long years, you know what I
mean. The menu hasn’t changed since
I ’ve been at Pitt, and I swear I saw, as
a freshman, that same green jello. The
exact same jello.

— The elevators in Tower A. As
long as there are students that insist on
piling into an already crowded elevator
those metal beasties will continue to
trap students between ﬂoors and make
landings that are bumpier than any
Apollo splashdown ever was.

— The lines at Thackeray Hall dur-
ing the first, or any other, day during
the registration period. Regardless of
whether the place iscalled Mervis Hall
or Thackeray Hall or Carnegie Hall,
this will be a Pitt tradition until the
computer lines freeze over.

is not and never will be a weekend par-
ty school. Forbes Avenue on a Thurs-
day night will always look as busy as
it does during the middle of the day ——
unless, of course, there is another pro-
hibition in this country.

— The french fries at the 0. It is a
known fact that the fries at the 0
always taste better at 2 a.m. than they
do at 2 p.m. Sorry, day folk, but it is
an Oakland tradition. If you don‘t
believe me, stay up late some night and
find out for yourself.

for every lecture, and every one of his
classes will be interesting. Thanks,

been directly caused by smoking — but
surely to that of others.

To a Marxist, the cigarette com-_
panies must look like a gift from
heaven —— or whatever the comparable
Marxist expression may be. They are
caricatures of the conscienceless cor-
poration, the ruthless exploiter of man
and mankind. With their money, they
buy the best minds in the advertising
business to sell their product and the
best brains in the legal profession to de-
fend it. So far they have staved off the
inevitable. But eventually, a court will
set a precedent — after that, the deluge.

In the meantime, the law has made
a fool of itself. A jury has found
cigarettes nonaddictive and R.J.
Reynolds blameless for the death of
John Galbraith. In fact, both the
cigarette company and Galbraith had
reached a fine understanding: It made
the cigarettes. he smoked them, and
both must have known they could kill.

every year when they try to replace
those writers that have been lost to
graduation. However, every year there
will be new writers and those old ones
will be long forgotten. Just wait and see
how long it takes to forget this writer.

- Finally Gare you getting as tired
of reading this as I am of writing it),
the Pitt student body. The people will
change but their attitude will remain.
Pitt students are apathetic as a rule and

generally tend to skip too many classes. ,

This is true. but Pitt students will
always be up for a good time and most
will find it.

Of course, I might be wrong. The
Towers Cafeteria might start serving
gourmet meals next fall, and Pitt
Stadium might turn into a place of good
cheer and warmth. Don't count on it
though. Like I said, some things just
never change.

much different than tax evasion. “You
see, tax evaders do it just because they
want the money for themselves,” said
Sperry. “Tax resistance is a principle
stand against the military tax.

“We don’t encourage you to evade
your taxes,” Sperry continued.
“We’re not saying we are opposed to
taxation; we’re opposed to the
enormous amounts of money being

spent by the military."

People can resist taxes in several
ways, Sperry explained. Legally.
though, little can be done. To remain
within the law, resisters can merely
earn less than a taxable income.
However, this requires a dramatic ad-
justment to one’s lifestyle — an adjust-
ment which might prove too difficult
for many individuals.

“When that thing gets mailed in, somebody has to
open that envelope. If just one person is touched, then
it [the letter] is considered a success. ”

Illegally. a person can refuse to pay

the federal excise tax attached to
monthly telephone bills. “It is. without
a doubt. the easiest form of tax
resistance — the one that brings the
least consequences,” Sperry said.
. Sperry claimed that the telephone tax
is directly connected to military spend-
ing, and he pointed out that the tax rate
has risen and fallen with the rate of
military involvement.

War—tax resistance:

By Dan Bates
News Editor

The IRS keeps a watchful eye on
81-year-old Marian Hahn, a resi-
dent of Shadyside. Each year, she
refuses to pay a portion out of her
bank account. She is a war-tax
resister.

“I feel it’s a very respectable
thing to refuse to pay taxes when
they’re being used to pay for im-
moral things,” said Marian, a
member of the local Religious
Society of Friends. “I protest
because I don’t think we should be
sending young men to kill other
young men and preparing to bomb
other people’s homes like we did
in Vietnam.”

Marian merely abides by the
Quaker testimony of peace which
states that members should live in
the life and the power which take
away the occasion for all war. It
also states that one should be
prepared to uphold the testimony
against the violence of war and to
suffer the consequences of standing
by his conscience  which may be
in conﬂict with public opinion.

“It’s up to you how you choose
to respond to the peace testimony,”
Marian said. She chose war-tax
resistance because “I just feel it’s
right to do, and I have a respon-
sibility to do it.”

Although Marian said she has
always been interested in the peace
movement, she did not begin
resisting taxes until about ten years
ago. She said she knew of a couple
of people who did not pay taxes,
and at ﬁrst, she admitted she was
aghast. “I felt, ‘How could this
happen —— how could they do that?’
You know, I thought it was
something way out, as it were.”

And as the one resister told
Marian about how the IRS would
come and take what she owed out
of her bank account, Marian said
she just could not understand the
purpose of tax resistance. Ap-

defense set the course for Marian’s
future as a tax resister. “The

Marian said. “That impressed me

At one time, she managed to
maintain an income which was
below the taxable level, but she said
it just got to the point where she
could not do that very well
anymore. However, she has con-
tinued to refuse payment of the por-
tion of her income taxes which she
believes goes toward present
military spending.

tax has several times prompted IRS
agents to pay her a visit. She told
of one man who appeared at her
door and asked her if she wanted
him to put a lien on her car.

“No I didn’t want them to put a
lien on my car, and I didn’t think
they would,” she said. “Finally,
they did go to my bank account,
which they still do.”

Marian said she would probably
continue resisting taxes until the
day she dies. “However, I guess if
they put me in jail, I’d maybe con-

never been to jail.

“Besides,” she concluded, “I
doubt if they’d even want to put me
in jail with my gray hair and all.”

Pitt’s School of Social Work and
Hebrew Union College’s School of
Jewish Communal Service in Los
Angeles have developed a joint degree
program in conjunction with the United
Jewish Federation of Greater Pitts-
burgh. The new program enables both
a master’s degree in social work and
a master’s degree in Jewish communal
studies within a two—year period of
study.

Open to students who want to make
Jewish communal service a career, this
program will qualify interested students
in careers in community centers, family

, and children’s agencies, federations

and councils, homes for the aged,
hospitals, vocational and guidance

oriented services.

The ﬁrst year of the program is con-
ducted on the campus of Hebrew Union
College in Los Angeles. The college’s
School of Jewish Communal Service
offers courses such as Jewish History,
Jewish Family, Jewish Organizational
Structures, Jewish social service
delivery systems and patterns, basic
courses in social work, plus field ex-
perience in Jewish communal agencies
in the Los Angeles area.

The following year, students "move
to Pitt’s School of Social Work, where
they complete the second year of the
master’s curriculum and, at the same
time, take ﬁeld experience in a Jewish
communal agency in the Pittsburgh

federaltax line on your phone bill,"
Sperry said. “Moreover. they can’t
disconnect your phones."

W—4 resistance is another way to il-
legally resist taxes. “This is the most
common,” Sperry said, "but again,
this is illegal." A person simply
overstates the number of exemptions on
the W—4 form of the tax return.

However, he added that there are
possible consequences for W—4
resistance. “Although cases are limited
and most people are just harassed. they
can‘ face civil or criminal penalties,”
Sperry said. “They do consider that to
be fraudulent.”

Sperry related a story of an extreme
case of W—4 resistance where a man
claimed all the children of Indo-China
on his exemptions during the Vietnam
war. “That’s a class example, though,
and the IRS obviously jumped right on
it. ”

For those who are not comfortable
“taking a real giant step into doing tax
resistance,” Sperry urges the practice
of “symbolic resistance,” which in-
volves the refusal to pay the percentage
of income taxes equal to the current
military budget.

“It doesn’t involve a lot of money,
and you are just making a statement,"
Sperry said. “That subjects you to a
tax- liability, but it doesn’t really open
you up to any major problems.”

Finally, Sperry encouraged resisters
to attach letters to their tax forms ex-
plaining their stand against the war
taxes. “It furthers the strength of our
protest, and it also helps you in the
future with your case if you ever have
to deal with IRS auditors,” he said.

“When that thing gets mailed in,
somebody has to open that-envelope.
If just one person is touched, then it
[the letter] is considered a success.”

Apparently, though, the IRS is
touched in the wrong way. In fact, the
IRS is standing ﬁrm against tax
resisters. Backed by the 16th Amend-
ment, which gives Congress the power
to “lay and collect taxes on income,
from whatever source derived,” the
IRS will impose strict civil and criminal
penalties on those who do not comply
to the law, according to a 1983 IRS
memorandum.

In an attempt to discourage the ﬁling
of illegal tax returns, a $500 ﬁne
known to tax resisters as ‘ the
“Frivolous Tax ﬁne” may be imposed.
The IRS hopes the penalty will be a
useful deterrent against tax resistance,
the memorandum stated.

Despite IRS attempts to curb
resistance, tax protests are continuing.
As Sperry concluded, “If you don’t
believe in war, then why pay for it?”

Expectant mothers giving birth at
Mercy Hospital’s new Family Mater-
nity Center will feel very much at home
in the new rooms which feature a new
concept in obstetrics: the
Labor/Delivery/Recovery rooms.

The concept involves combining the
labor, delivery and recovery rooms into
a’ single, home-like room, eliminating

‘constant patient transfer and providing

a more comfortable, familiar setting.
Originally introduced in Midwest
hospitals, the Mercy LDR is the ﬁrst
of its type in the Pittsburgh area.

“The LDR rooms are similar in con-

mothers desiring a totally natural
childbirth," ‘said Beverly Haines, Pa-
tient Care Services manager for Mer-
cy. “However, there is one big dif-
ference — the LDR room is fully
equipped with sophisticated delivery
equipment for obstetrical emergencies
and infant resuscitation, should it be
required.”

The equipment is concealed in the
wooden furniture, closets and wall
panels so as not to distract from the
homey setting. The LDR is designed
for most normal deliveries, including
natural childbirth.

“Every effort was made to conceal
sterile hospital equipment and to create
a comfortable, homey environment,"

”

-’.‘.-'. . . . .

#For instance, rooms were designed
to resemble home bedrooms and
feature wallpapered walls, parquet
floors and private bathrooms with
showers. Wood accents were used
throughout the rooms to emphasize the
warm residential feeling,” continued
Linder. “The doors are made of wood,
and wood trim was added to create the
home-like setting.”

The biggest challenge, according to
Linder, was to make the room look and

feel like a home bedroom and still in-
clude the necessary delivery room
equipment. To accomplish this,
wooden furniture was specially de-
signed to house the equipment.

For instance, a nightstand hides elec-
tronic fetal monitoring equipment. The
bed lies ﬂat like a normal bed, but it
can be quickly converted into a delivery
bed. Infant resuscitation equipment is
stored in a bedroom-like closet, and
anesthesia equipment is concealed
behind a wall panel.

The walls are papered with soft, sub-
tle designs in pink, mauve, corals and
peaches, with accents of blue. In each
room, at least one wall is painted to off-
set the wallpaper.

Softer, reﬂected lighting is used
around the perimeter of the room in-

stead of overhead ﬂuorescent lighting.
Floor lamps are provided in each room
to further add to the residential am-
biance. Each room is also furnished
with a desk, wardrobe, reclining chair
and a solid oak cradle for the newborn
baby.

The center’s nursery was designed
in a similar motif. Lower lighting,_

‘children’s wallpaper and brightly col-

ored paint were utilized to create a
home-like atmosphere. The nursery is
also furnished with wooden cradles as
opposed to traditional hospital infant
beds.

The Maternity Center has a 19-bed I

capacity, including three LDR rooms,
two regular labor rooms for high—risk
births and 12 postpartum rooms. All
rooms are single occupancy.

“I believe the Student Government
Board has ﬁnally gained the respect of
the university,” Luke Kluchko stated
recently, reﬂecting upon his year as
president of the organization.

SGB accomplished many things this
past year, he said. “We began work-
ing before our inaguration in January.
We made a thorough evaluation of the
standing committees. We eliminated
the Academic Affairs Committee
because we felt it wasn’t necessary.
Also, we reduced funds for the Elec-
tion Committee since it functions only
six months a year."

"We organized the Pitt basketball
shuttle as a spirit project. In addition.
we passed out free pompoms to the
students.” Kluchko continued.

In March, SGB encouraged student
involvement concerning the proposed

cuts in federal student aid. “We
distributed over 9,000 writing cam-
paign kits to Pitt students in one
week." he said. '

Through this campaign, students ex-
pressed their opinions about the aid
reductions. SGB then mailed the
responses to the government.

“SGB also dealt with a very emo-
tional issue. The two ROTC courses
that were denied credit in 1968 were
brought up again. We decided to credit
the courses. They were Finance and
Foreign Relations,” said Kluchko.

Kluchko stated he spent much of his
summer vacation working and planning
in the SGB ofﬁce. “We installed a new
computer system. Now we’re in touch
with 40 other student governments
statewide by‘ means of electronic
mail."

This fall, the organization developed
the Freshman Challenge game. Clues

award will be made in_the 1985-1986 academic year.

The prize, in memory of Alison Bentley Kephart, was established
through the generosity of her parents, Drs. Marian and Ronald Bentley,
and friends of the family. The Bentleys have been associated with the
department since its inception and have an abiding interest in excellence
in undergraduate and graduate education.

various buildings across campus. Its
purpose was to allow new students to
explore the campus while playing the
game.

Currently, SGB is involved with a
student survey concerning the academic
calendar review. The review includes
a spring break in March and an extend-
ed Thanksgiving vacation. Kluchko ex-
plained that this permits a break within
each term. In addition. the winter term
would be extended. forming a rede-
ﬁned spring term. The summer session
then would be shortened, he said. The
results of the survey will be available
in January.

Jim Mumma succeeds Kluchko as
the 1986 SGB president. He‘ll take of-
fice in January.

Kluchko concluded. “As president,
I feel I gave SGB my best. I‘m not disa-
pointed with my job. We set some good

' examples, and I challenge the next
board to do better.”

Army grants
$1.3 million
contract to
Pitt, CMU

The .University of Pittsburgh School
of Medicine, with Carnegie—Mellon
University, recently received a three-
year, $1.3 million unclassiﬁed contract
from the U.S. Army’s Chemical
Research Development Center in Aber-
deen, Md., to establish a Chemical
Systems Biotechnology Center.

The center, which will be head-
quartered in Scaife Hall on Pitt’s cam-

pus, will conduct research on the ,

gamma—amino-butyric acid neurorecep-
tor which is found in the body’s cen-
tral nervous system and is responsible
for muscular movements.

The focus of the study is to isolate,
purify, clone, immobilize, characterize
and reconstitute the GABA neurorecep-
tor in large quantities. To date, only the

acetylcholine receptor has ever been

cloned.

“Understanding the unique charac-
teristics of the GABA neuroreceptor,
which is a vital part of so many bodily
functions, has many applications in
medical research and biotechnology,”
explained Lemuel B. Wingard Jr.,
Ph.D.,‘professor of pharmacology at
Pitt’s School of Medicine and principal
investigator. “One area in particular
which could beneﬁt from this research
is the design and development of new
medications. There are some medica-
tions on the market which are very ef-
fective yet they are accompanied by
adverse side effects. Our project could
help drug researchers design and
develop targeted medications with
fewer adverse side effects.”

The Army’s long—range goal is to
develop methods where GABA
neuroreceptors may be used in the
design of biosensors for the detection
of GABA binding chemical agents.

There are a small number of Pitt and
CMU faculty members involved with
this project. Coordinating the efforts at
CMU is William E. Brown, Ph.D.,
associate professor of biological
sciences.

The Chemical Systems Biotech-
nology Center is one of three centers
to be established under the RCDC’s
Chemical Systems Technology Center
programs, although Pitt is the only
university involved in biotechnology
research. The University of Florida has
developed a Chemical Systems
Chemistry Center, and State Univer-
sity of Buffalo, N.Y. has established
a Chemical Systems Air Purification
Center.

Development of these centers will
enhance the CRDC’s research and
development through close and contin-
uing association with university scien-
tists in various parts of the country. It

.will also provide research and

engineering support to mission-related
/technology areas for CRDC, training
opportunities for CRDC personnel and
the opportunity for collaboration be-
tween CRDC personnel and universi-
scientists

The Pitt News, January 6, 1986

Redmen ni improved Panthers. . .

- Chaz alla/The Pitt News
Following Roy Chipman’s juggling of the Pitt starting lineup, the Panthers

responded with four consecutive wins, including an 80-76 victory over Georgetown
at the Civic Arena. The streak was broken Saturday at St. J ohn’s where the Pan-
thers lost in overtime, 78-75.

By Jim Urban
Sports Editor

Pitt head basketball coach Roy
Chipman stunned Pitt basketball
officials Dec. 18 when he announc-
ed that he is resigning his post, ef-
fective the end of the season. Chip-
man tendered his resignation to Pitt
Athletic Director Dr. Edward
Bozik, citing personal reasons, and
said that he never intends to coach
basketball again._

“As of [Dec. 13] I resigned my
position here as the University of
Pittsburgh basketball coach effec-
tive at the end of this year,” Chip—
man stated at a press conference
held in the William Pitt Union
Assembly Room. “I want to make
it clear up front that this decision
is a personal decision. It is
something that I have thought about
for some time, it was not
something that has occurred in the
last two weeks or three weeks.”

Chipman’s resignation came a
few days after an 11-point loss to

West Virginia in which his Pan- .

thers were unimpressive. It also

follows an NCAA investigation in-
to alleged recruiting violations of
Villanova forward Doug West, a
freshman from Altoona. West was
allegedly offered a large sum of
money by a central Pennsylvania
dentist to attend Pitt. Pitt officials
denied all allegations. The West
allegations, along with countless

other factors, had a hand in Chip— 8

man’s resignation. ~

“I think the damn game has
become far too important,” Chip—
man said. “I don’t think that we
are going to war. There are a lot
more things in the world that are
far more important than a basket-
ball game. I think it is about time
that people start to understand it.”

Chipman said that he wants to
spend more time with his family.
He stated that the incident of the
West allegations was the final
straw, so to speak, in his decision
to resign.

.‘ ‘I reached the decision when my
nine-year-old son came home and
wanted to know if I was going to
jail for illegal recruiting,” Chip—
man said. “I said to myself, ‘It’s

3 ,7

not that important.

Chipman came to Pitt in 1981
from Lafayette. Since then, he has
taken the Panthers to post—season
play in four of his ﬁve years as
head coach. The year the Panthers
did not qualify for post—season
play, they upset three nationally
ranked teams in Georgetown,
Syracuse and St. J ohn’s. His career
record is 314-142, and he was in-
strumental in Pitt’s entrance into
the Big East and its emergence in-
to the national spotlight.

‘ ‘I feel I havealot of stake in this
program,” Chipman said. “I think
in the last ﬁve years, we have come
a long way.”

Chipman said that he did not
want to be coaching basketball
when he was 55 years old. He is
currently 46, and he said that he
feels the time to get out is now if
he wants to get involved in
something else. He said that he
does not know what type of work
he would seek, or where.

Since Chipman’s resignation, the
Panthers are 4-1, including an
80-76 victory over Georgetown.

By Randy Miller
Assistant Sports Editor

NEW YORK CITY — Pitt
basketball coach Roy Chipman
made two of the biggest moves in
his coaching career over the
Christmas holidays. V

When Chipman announced on
December 18 that he would resign
following the current season for
personal reasons, the question
arose whether a lame-duck coach
would have a negative effect on a
talented team with a deceptive 5-2
record —- having fattened up on
weak teams yet losing in their first
two tests at Xavier and West
Virginia.

Chipman answered to critics in
his first game after announcing his
shocking decision to leave Pitt. The
sixth—year head coach moved Cur-
tis Aiken from point guard to
shooting guard, and leading scorer
Charles Smith fromp forward to
center, and the results have been
nothing short of sensational.

Pitt promptly marched off four
consecutive impressive wins (in-
cluding a 80-76 confidence-
building win over Georgetown last
Thursday in the Big East Con-
ference opener at the Civic Arena)
before taking 10th—ranked St.
John’s into overtime before bow-
ing 78-75 . .

Pitt defeated Florida State, Texas
A & M and Southwest Louisiana
in the Sugar Bowl Classic, and beat

Page 11’

Georgtown before losing the heart-
breaker to St. J ohn’s before a noisy
sold—out crowd of over 6,000 at
Alumni Hall. Pitt is 9-3 overall and
1-1 in the Big East.

The outside shooting of Aiken

has given Pitt someone to assist L

Smith with the scoring duties.

Aiken, who finished with a team
high 23 points, single—handed1y
kept Pitt within striking distanceiin
the first half by shooting 8-8 from
the field — and all were from 20-25
feet. -

“I felt pretty good tonight,”

Aiken said. “I think it helps the
team [playing shooting guard], as
I don’t think we can beat the good
teams with just one offensive
threat.”

St. J ohn’s raced to an early 19-6
lead on Pitt, but the Panthers didn’t
go belly—up as they have so often

in the past against the better Big .

East teams on the road.

“I said we better get our ass in
gear or we’re gonna get beat bad,”
Chipman said he told the team after
the Redmen’s quick start.

Pitt responded to Chipman’s
words of wisdom by running off an
11-2 spurt to cut the lead to 21-17.

Aiken keyed the comeback with‘

three loiig jumpers.

“That kid Aiken was just
unbelievable,” said St. John’s
coach Louie Carnesecca after the
game. “He was 11 for 13 from the
field and if he was in the NBA he

would have had 33 points because
all were three—point plays.”

St. John’s maintained a 41-34
halftime lead, but Pitt again rallied
in the second half and shocked the
crowd by grabbing the lead at
50-49 -on a Keith Armstrong layup
with 11:25 remaining.

The teams traded baskets the
ﬁnal 10 minutes and Pitt tied the
game 67-67 on Smith’s short turn-
around jumper with 1:50 remain-
ing in regulation. St. John’s had
three shots to win, but Walter
Berry, who led St. John’s with 23
points, missed a jumper with 42

seconds left. St. John’s (14-1, 2-0) /

rebounded and held for a ﬁnal shot,

but both guard Ron Rowan and
Berry missed jumpers in the ﬁnal
three seconds to send the game in-
to overtime.

Pitt’s hopes of upsetting St.
John’s were dimmed just 14
seconds into the overtime session
when Mark Jackson hit a jumper
while being fouled by Smith. The
foul was Smith’s ﬁfth, and Jackson
connected on the free throw to give
St. John’s a three-point lead they
would never surrender.

“I think this game showed a
lot,” Aiken said. “They [St.
John’s] have played great and we
were just able to go out and execute
after the first 10 minutes. And

when we execute I think we can
play with anyone.”

Pitt executed on both ends of the
court after St. John’s fast start —
except at the free throw line.

Pitt shot 62.9 percent from the
ﬁeld (72 percent in the second half)
while the 1-3-1 zone defense forced
St. John’s to shoot only 37.5 per-
cent in the second half. But Pitt was
only 5-12 from the foul line while
the Redmen hit on 24-29 attempts.
“Oh! It killed us,” Chipman said

The Pitt News‘, January 6, 1986

Panther grapplers
face W V U tomorrow

By Patrick Good
Staff Writer

It was a long and rather quiet holi-
day for the Panther wrestling team.
After placing several wrestlers among
the top-place ﬁnishers at the Lock
Haven and Penn State Invitationals, the
Panthers came up dry while competing
at the prestigious Midlands tournament
in Evanston, Ill.‘

“The Midlands are really tough,”
said Coach Rande Stottlemyer. “The
tournament rivals the Nationals, as
everybody is there, and because they
allow others [non—collegians] to com-
pete also. Our team took a lot of time
off and I wasn’t that surprised that we
didn’t wrestle that well. We don’t
usually take that much time off.”

As for the new year, it’s a new
season for theiPanthers as they begin
1986 traveling to West Virginia on
Tuesday to face the 18th-ranked Moun-
taineers. A year ago Pitt was defeated
by the close margin of 20-15 at home
to WVU. This season Stottlemyer and
company are hoping for a different
ﬁnish. “Well, everybody will be in the
line-up and they should be ready to
roll,” Stottlemyer stated.

One Panther who is ready to roll is
senior Kyle Nellis, now Pitt’s all-time
winningest wrestler with 82 match vic-

tories in his four-year career. With 13
dual meet matches left he has a chance
to add to that impressive total. Unfor-
tunately, Nellis wasn’t able to build to
that mark during the holiday as he, like
his teammates, was a victim of the
fierce competition at the Midlands tour-
nament. There was one bright spot for
the co-captain as he was recently
ranked fourth at 134 lbs. to become the
first Panther to be ranked nationally
since assistant coach Jeff Jelic, who
ironically is the person Nellis passed
in becoming the career wins record
holder.

As for Nellis and his teammates,
they’ll reload their guns for the dual
meet season that begins with WVU on
the road. After their trip down I-79 it
doesn’t get any easier for this much-
underrated squad. Two days later
they’ll be at home to host 10th—ranked
Lehigh University. Pitt may have more
than a homefield edge, as they defeated
the Engineers 25-19 on the road last
year.

Though 1985 ended rather quietly,
the Panthers are hoping 1986 will open

The Pitt News-, January 6,1986

5 By Jim Urban

1985 — The best and the worst

The year of 1985 had some real
good times; it also offered some
bad times. Here are the best and
worst of 1985:

Best — When the Pitt men's

Villanova, 85-69, before a national
television audience on March 2.

Charles Smith played his most
impressive game of the year,
scoring 18 points, grabbing nine
rebounds and blocking three shots,
all against the eventual National
Champion Wildcats. Playing down
low against Villanova’s NCAA
Tournament MVP Ed Pinckney,
Smith canned 9 of 12 shots from
the ﬁeld.

Smith ﬁnished the year with

averages of 15 ppg and 8 rpg, and
shot 50 percent from the ﬁeld. He
was named the Big East Freshman
of the Year, and clearly had the
most impact on a Pitt sports team
since Tony Dorsett.

Worst — Pitt’s opening—round
loss to Louisiana Tech in the
NCAA Tournament. The Panthers
never got outof the gate and were
embarrassed by Louisiana Tech,
78-54. Had it not been for a decent
second half, the score may have
been worse. .

Best — Pitt opened the football
season with a 31-30 victory over
Purdue at Pitt Stadium. Panther
tailback Charles Gladman rushed
for 163 yards on 24 carries in that
game, and never looked back. He
went on to become Pitt’s fourth
1,000-yard rusher ever, joining the
likes of Dorsett, Elliot Walker and
Bryan Thomas. '

Worst — The 31-0 loss to Penn
State at Pitt Stadium on November
23. The Nittany Lions came in
ranked No. 1 and had already ac-
t d b'd to the Or nge B wl

One of the most impressive performances of 1985 on the Pitt .cam1C)us was of-

team destroyed g

   

when they took the field. When
they left the ﬁeld, Pitt had sunk to
a new depth, and Foge Fazio’s fate
had been sealed. _

_ Best — The performance by the
Pitt soccer team in 1985. It was a
season of unparalleled accomplish-
ment for the Panthers as they went
11-4-2, their best record in recent
years.

Senior Victor Hugo led the Pitt
offense, scoring ﬁve goals and
adding six assists, but the heart of
the Pitt attack was the defense.
Goalie Dave Torrence held op-
ponents to an average of .76 goals
per game, and set Pitt records for
the most shutouts in a season (10),
and the most shutouts in a career
(23).

Worst — In the first round of the
Big East Soccer Championships,
Pitt was engaged in a scoreless tie
with Syracuse late in the first half.
A cornerkick by Syracuse’s Scott
Owsiany grazed off an unidentiﬁed
Pitt player and into the net to send
the Panthers into the locker room
at halftime down 1-0. The momen-
tum would never swing back to the
Panthers and they lost 2-0.

Best — When Jennifer Bruce
became .Pitt’s a1l—time leading
scorer (men or women) during her
final season with the Lady Panther
basketball squad. Bruce finished
with 2,295 career points, placing
her ahead of Clyde Vaughan, Larry
Harris, Don Hennon, Billy Knight,
Debbie Lewis, and Pam Mikla—
sevich, some prolific scorers.

The Lady Panthers suffered a
disappointing loss to Syracuse in
the opening round of the Big East
Tournament to end their season,
but the memory of Jennifer Bruce
will lin er on

    

  

Worst — When former Pitt
women’s basketball head coach
Judy Saurer threw me out of her of-
ﬁce following a one-point loss to
Villanova at home. Not exactly
gracious in defeat, Saurer was
forced to resign at the end of the
season, and is now coaching at
Gannon.

Best — For the third consecutive
year, the Pitt swimming and div-
ing teams finished at the top of the
Big East Conference. What will
they do for encores? Probably add
another championship for both the
men and the women.

Worst — When it comes to Pitt
swimming and diving, it seems the
only bad thing that happens is
graduation. Gone is Olympian Sue
Heon, but that is not all that bad.
At Pitt, the swim teams do not
rebuild, they reload.

Best — Pitt track and ﬁeld added
a ﬂash to its team last year. That
ﬂash’s name is Lee McRae.

In his first year, McRae was an
All-America both indoors and out-
doors. He won the Big East Most
Outstanding Performance both in-
doors and outdoors, and is a school
record holder in the 55, 100, and
200 meters. He can run.

Worst — At the NCAA outdoor
championships last spring, McRae
false started in the finals and was
relegated to a sixth-place finish.
Witnesses at the event still claim
that McRae did not false start.
Although controversial, the call
was not reversed. ,

The year that was did have some
good times, as is evident from the
above; the year that is may have
even more. A new football coach
and a victory over Georgetown
have already offered signs of
promise. ‘See you next year.

rebounds as Pitt blew away the eventual National Champions by 23 points in
front of a national television audience.

The sporting life

A     a

Sports‘ breaEs down the barriers —- a friend recalls

I was in the McDonald’s near my
house a few days before Christmas.
I met a guy in there I hadn’t seen
in years. His name is Ben and we
were friends for one year, in ninth
grade. He didn’t really change. He
looked older but still there was the
shaggy blond hair and squinting
eyes that always made him seem
like he had been in the sun too
long.

We talked for a few minutes, but
it was awkward; neither of us knew
exactly what the right thing to say
was, so we assured each other we
would keep in touch and we went
away. That night I got to thinking
about Ben and ninth grade, and I
realized that he was one of the most
remarkable people I have ever met.

The thing about Ben is that he

was one of the most hard—core
heads in school. Maybe your

school had a different name for,

heads: pothead, druggie, wasto,
whatever. But in my school the
drug users were the heads. And
Ben wore the uniform of faded
jeans, old tennis shoes, a concert
shirt with a ﬂannel jacket, topped
by a crowning bandana twisted
through long hair.

Cancer’s
seven
warning
signals

1. Change in bowel or
bladder habits.

2. A sore that does not
heal.

3. Unusual bleeding or
discharge.

4. Thickening or lump
in breast or elsewhere.

5. Indigestion or difﬁculty
in swallowing.

6. Obvious change in wart
or mole. . A

7. Nagging cough or
hoarseness.

If you have a warning signal,
see your doctor.

 

I know that describes half the
kids in any yearbook, but what
made Ben different was his ﬁerce
love of baseball.

For most boys baseball is
nothing more than a passing
delight, something to while away
the hours between lunch and sup-
per on hot summer afternoons. A
few will play on Little League
teams and some will collect
baseball cards. With Ben baseball
was a mania, an obsession, and
that’s what made us friends.’

The junior high I went to had
very strict cliques. Being friends
with someone outside your own cli-
que meant instant alienation from
that clique. The group I was in with
was mostly jocks and as everybody
knows, the jocks and heads are the
Hatﬁelds and McCoys of high
school. A jock and a head could

never be friends — it simply was '

not done. This was the Code of the
Locker Room, and you dared not
violate it. It was a lot like the deal
in the movie “The Outsiders.”
Somehow Ben and I became
friends anyway. It started one fall
afternoon as we sat in last period
study hall. He was sitting behind
me and going over that morning’s

own job search.

 

sports page. He started talking to
no one in particular about the depth
of the Orioles pitching that year. I
said something like “yeah, but
their infield can’t hit.” He
vehemently disagreed (he was a big
Orioles fan) and a friendship was
born.

I took a lot of crap from my other
friends about hanging around Ben
and I’m sure he got the same treat-
ment from his gang. But as we both
learned, the love of baseball begun
in youngest childhood is deeper
than the teen—age need to belong.

That winter I found out
something else that amazed me.
Ben was a terriﬁc athlete. He quit
blowing off gym class and started
playing on our volleyball team.
Now Ben did his share of drinking
and way more than his share of
drugs, but none of that seemed to
affect his play. He became the con-
summate team leader and directed
us to ﬁfteen straight wins and a
berth in the school volleyball
championships. After we lost in the
ﬁnals he went right back to skip-
ping gym. I never asked him about
It.

Nothing in the world can cement
a friendship faster than playing on

the same team with somebody. It’s
like being army buddies without
the guns. I thought we were friends
for life.

Sometime during the course of
the year Ben got the idea to quit go-
ing to our study hall. It seemed like
a good idea, so I said sure. Instead
of the classroom we would go to
a forgotten hallway behind the
auditorium. There we would
carefully examine the previous
night’s box scores in the paper.
That newspaper, incidentally, was
the same one Ben had a habit of
pilfering from the library every
day. We would talk about the pen-
nant races, recent hitting streaks,
batting averages, and in the off-
season we would ask each other
trivia questions and go over
scouting reports for the upcoming
year.

But when I saw him a few weeks
ago none of that came immediate-
ly to mind. When I ﬁrst saw him
I got two images. One was of Ben
in English class one day yelling at
a substitute teacher. “You know
what your problem is?” he asked
her. “You hate kids!” The other

‘is of us in our secret hallway one

afternoon in early spring. He was
sitting on a discarded desk top, a
cigarette sleeping between his lips

and dark sunglasses hiding blood— ‘

shot eyes. “You know what I hate
most of -all?” he asked me.

“No, what?” I responded.

“Its that I could never play
baseball,” he replied.

I asked him if he didn’t think he
was good enough to play or what?

“Don’t you understand
anything?” he asked me. “If I
played baseball I’d lose every
friend I have.”

“Not me,” I offered.

“No,” he ﬁnally answered,
“not you.”

I wanted to tell him that it didn’t
matter. That any friend or group or
clique there was in high school was
a temporary thing and would
vanish into the air with the last
echoes of the valedictory speeches.

Because in baseball Ben had
found a friend for life. One that
would be there always with the

nuances of hanging curves, the 0

poetry of a triple and the grace of
a double play. Baseball is the only
thing that lasts for a kid with one
foot in two worlds and his heart
ﬁrmly in the bleachers.
