Duties as Faculty
Memloer in March

Dr. James Coull, a native of
Aberdeen, Scotland, has been ap-
pointed ])1‘ofc.s;-;o1' and head of the
depaﬂnicnt of chemical e1:gi11ee:’-
ing, according‘ to an :i:‘:nounce-
inent from E. A. llolbrook, dean
of the school of engineering.

_Dr. Coull will ﬁll the position Va"
cated by the death of Professor Har-
rison C. Bashioum, who died last Oc-
tober, and will join the University
faculty on March 1.

Studied in U. S.

In recognition of his superior un-
dergraduate work at the University
of Aberdeen, Scotland, Dr. Coull re- ,
ceived a graduate scholarship which‘
brought him to America for a year’s
study at Massachusetts Institute of
Technology. At Columbia university
he later won both the-M. A. and Ph.
D. degrees.

Dr. Coull has been a professor of
chemical engineering at the Cooper
Union Institute of Technology, where
for the last three years he has seen
one of his students receive the na-
tional student prize offered by the
American Institute of Chemical En-
gineers.

In joining the University depart-
,ment of chemical engineering, now
one of the oldest and largest accred-
ited departments in this country, Dr.
Coull intends to cooperate with the
many chemical engineering indus-
tries of the Pittsburgh district by de-
veloping graduate work in this ﬁeld
leading to MS and PhD degrees. ,

Commenting on the appointment of
Dr. Coull, Dr. William A. Hamor, as-
sistant director of the Mellon Insti-
tute, said this week: “Dr. Coull, ed-
ucated professionally as a physical
chemist in a strong training school of
physical chemistry, is unusually qual-

ing of today.-

“After his sound fundamental
training in Scotland, Dr. Coull pur-

gineering at MIT and at Columbia
University, two of the leading train-
ing schools in chemical engineering
in the United States. Subsequently
he has had a wealth of industrial re-
search experience. He_h_as gained a
ﬁne reputation as a teacher at Cooper
Union in New York City, {in insti-
tution famous for its thorough chem-
ical engineering instruction.

“In addition,” said Dr. Hamor, “Dr.
Coull possesses the personal qualities
that will aid materially in making
his work successful at the University
and in this important industrial re-
gion. I feel conﬁdent that Pitt has
made a wise selection.”

Vote Favors Aid i
By Narrow Margin 1!

Student opinion on the proposed!
plan to provide for European refugee !
students at the University is almost?
evenly divided, according to the re- i
sults of a poll conducted this week i
by representatives of students
Vestigating the problem.

Two qestions were asked in the
poll:

(1) Are you in favor of the pro-
posed plan of a campus—wide com-
mittee to aid refugee students?

(2) Would you contribute toward
such a plan?

Reaction to both questions was
identical, with nearly every one who
favored the plan indicating their
willingness to contribute. "

YES, said - . . . . . . . . . . . .48.8 per cent
NO, said . . . . . . . . . . . . .46.8 per cent
NO opinion, said . . . . . . 4.4 per cent

Men Less VVilling

Men students were much less will-
ing to support the plan than women.
Only 45.9 per cent of the men fav-
ored the plan, while 54.1 per cent of
the men answered “No.” A major-
ity of women students, 55.8 per cent,
approved of the plan.

Results of the poll in different
schools of the University revealed

dents in the College ‘and the School
of Education favored the plan by

. small majorities, 53.5 percent and

51.4 per cent, respectively.

All members of the student
refugee -commitee will meet in 227
Cathedral at 3:30 o’clock today.
Attendance is requested as import-
ant business will be" discussed.

-In the School-of-éEngineer«ing-~and~~
Mines, deﬁnite opposition to the
plan was indicated. Only 32.6 per
cent of the students in these schools
favored the refugee—aid proposals,
while 67.4 per cent oposed the plan.
Opposition to the plan was also
revealed in the School of Business
Administration, twith 44.9 per cent

' approvingthe plan, while 55.1 per.

cent viewed it with disfavor.
Professional Results
Samples taken in the Schools of
Medicine, Dentistry, Law, and the
Graduate School were too small for
an accurate concensus of opinion to
be judged. Totals for the four
schools showed 61.1 per cent in favor
of the plan. '
This total, however, was inﬂuenc-
ed by the Graduate School vote,
yvliich was 77.8 per cent in favoriof
the plan. ., Students in the School
of Law were 60 per cent in favor of
the plan.  ‘ ~
Combined opinion of the Schools
of Medicine and Dentistry showed
strong opposition to the plan, by a
margin of 75 per cent to 25 per cent.

Dr. Erskine Pleads for Freer

Education At Honorary/9s Dinner

(see editorial on page two)

“We are all little tyrants in schools
and universities, even though we
have good intentions,” said Dr. John
Erskine, author, lecturer, and music
critic at the dinner meeting of the
Phi Beta Kappa Association of West-
ern Pennsylvania Tuesday evening.

“In my day, college papers were
completely free. Today, each school
has a person who supervises publi-
cations. The students are not al-
lowed the
error,” Dr. Erskine declared.

As a remedy ior some of the evils
in present day college education, Dr.
Erskine suggested that the profes-
sors should meet new students at the
entrance to the university and say,
“Here is complete liberty. You have
a chance to obtain an education. You
are under no obligation to come to
class. This,” he said, “would scare
the daylights out of most students,
but men like John Marshall were ac-
customed to doing just that.” A

Dr. Erskine contrasted the facili-
ties of the students of the University
with those of the founders of Phi
Beta Kappa, men like John Marshall
and Thomas Jefferson, who met in
the Raleigh Tavern ‘at Williamsburg,

and W. O. Howarth.

Virginia.

freedom of making an‘

“Men of that period had an ethical
training that we do not have today,”
Dr. Erskine said. “They could not
read any Greek litearture without
coming across morals and liberty
which are inseparable.”

Dr. Charles Glen King, professor
of chemistry at the University and a
member of both Phi Beta Kappa and
Sigma Xi, spoke on “Science and
Freedom.” “In America, as in other
countries, we have forgotten what
democracy involves,” he said. “We
must take our citizenship much more:
seriously.” ,

Dr. Alexander Mann, bishop of the‘
Protestant Episcopal diocese of Pitts-
burgh, presided at the dinner meet-
ing which was held in the facuzlty
club. Bishop Mann was fre—el‘ect'ed
president of the Western Pennsyl-
vania Association. Dr. F.lD'-.. Tyson,
professor of economics at the Univer-
sity was re-elected secretary-treas-
urer, and Miss Thyrsa W. Amos, dean
of women, continued in office as a
member of the executive committee.

Dr. Tyson told the group that the
united chapters and senate of Phi
Beta Kappa have embarked on a pro-
gram to promote intellectual freedom

in the United States.

We and Br. Erskine!

ROM what we 've been hearing lately, it. would

seem that college newspapers are irresponsible,
hell-raising publications, edited by troublesome, un-
rcpresentative groups of students who are little
more than cheap sensationalists.

"We were, crmsequently, quite disillusioned to
hear that. I)r. John Erskine, in a daring address
before the local Phi Beta Kappa society, found
today's college papers tame in comparison with
those of his day. Then, it seems, tl1e only check on
college editors was exercised by the sheriffs and
police departments; now faculty supervisors and
“advisers” are on college payrolls to see that
nothing detrimental to the best interests of their
institutions comes from the battered typewriters
of these wild-eyed student editors.

Of course, we have been blowing off about free-
uom of the college press and deploring censorship
and all of that. But we have, quite naturally,
been regarded as obstinate a11d impractical. After
all, what right: do smart.-aleck college kids have to
go around expressing their opinions about a. lot of
things they don’t know anything about?

So we were quite surprised to discover that we

.. had. such distinguished company as Dr. Erskine. It

made us think, for awhile, that maybe we weren’t

quite so screwy after all. .
But that sudden ﬂush of social approval passed

just as quickly. And we began to think that we

-and Dr. Erskine MUST be wrong.

Because college papers are really such inconse-
('1ue11tia.l elements in the pattern of education. Be-
cause no one seems to care anyway.

 V, For. after all, it really doesn’t matter that most

"college newspapers carry, as a matter of form, the
.,sj,ub-title “ofﬁcial_STUDENT newspaper.” It neces-
_.sari_ly follows that! whether students and faculty

' read accurate, true. uncensored news and opinion
, really. d_oesn’t matter at all.

AUSTIN, Texas, Feb. 24.—Ameri-
can foreign policy has ﬂared, in head-
lines recently with President Roose-
velt’s announcement that the United
States ‘is helping the democracies of
the world keep in stride in the Euro-
pean arms race. American public
opinion approves, 3 to 2, according to
the Galluppoll. But college students
are pretty well divided on the issue.

By the very slim‘ majority of 2.8
per cent, American collegians last
week voted in -favor ofiselling war
planes to democracies and not to dis-
tatorships, itgis pointed outiin a na-
tional referendum conducted by the
Student Opinion Surveys of America
for The News and other cooperating
college newspapers; _ . .

H The question asked of a" carefully-
selected cross-section‘ ‘everywhere
over the nation was, “Do you approve
of the United States .sé_lling"planes to
the so-called democratic countries
and not to the so-called -dictator

countries?” _
Approve . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. 52.8%
Disapprove . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. 47.2%

As January ended the President
blankly told the senate military af-
the United

fairs committee that

States should aid Britain and France
in thwarting the objective of the
Rome-Ber1in—Tokyo axis. Shortly
before it had been disclosed that with
the President’s blessing France had
been sold 600' latest-type military
planes. V q d ., Q ‘
Students who agree with the Pres-
ident state that the democracies must
staytogetherwat‘ any cost in stemming
the tide of Fascism. Others, believe
thesale of aircraft will help econom-
ically and will aid the industry.

By Jerry I-Hahn

Discontented students say that if
they don’t go fraternity, they can’t
have any social life on campus. They
say that the University is nothing
more than a “big high school.”

Do these students realize that since
April 1, 1938, they have had a social
club on campus, founded to ﬁll the
social gap suffered by non—fraternity
students like themselves?

Did these “discontents” do any-
thing to remedy their own plight by
joining this club? Certainly not—
only about 50 were interested enough
to join.

The purpose of the Club is to pro-
vide low cost social functions for all
students of the University. Accord-
ing to George Hartman, C40, presi-
dent and one of the founders, “It is
an attempt to bring together those
students who desire social entertain-
ment but who do not want, or who
cannot afford, to join a fraternity.”

Receiving recognition from SFA on
April 1, 1938, the organization has
since held many successful social
events. The Club makes trips to
Conneaut Lake Park, holds picnics at
the County parks, and arranges af-
fairs at theaters, swimming pools,
roller skating rinks and any other
places that the members desire. For
example, Friday, a dance was held at
the Sky—Vue night club.

Amity constitution provides that
members must have quality point av-
erage of 1.0 for the preceding semes-
ter and that they must observe all
rules and regulations. There are no
dues ‘connected with the Club in any
way; the assessmentsfor the various
affairs are determined by majority
rule. _ V _

Meetings are held in 151 Cathedral
every Monday at 2 o’clock, and are
‘conductaed according to ’pa_r1'iamen-
tary law. At present, the organiza-
tion is composed of 50 students, but
in thevnear future it intends to ex-

pand its membership.

List of Entrants Greatest’
In History of University

Title Meets, Gison Says

Records Should Fall Before Assaults

Of Bazyk, Clifton;

By Joe Kristufek
‘With a nationally known mile-re-
lay team and a blind high-jumper as
the main attraction, all signs point to
a record breaking crowd as well as
record breaking performances in the
seventh annual University Indoor
"Track Championships, which will
open tomorrow afternoon at 1:30
o’clock in the indoor track house.
Coach Olson announces that the
number of entrants far surpasses that
- ..  of previous years
}and that although
 such favorites as
I‘. Johnny Woodruff
and Kenny Ryden
will be unable to
 participate due to
9:? injuries, there will
be enough stars on
hand to insure a
first class show.
The meet is
strictly an all-Uni-
versity affair, on-
ly members of the
track team and
other students

 

Woodriiff Still Out

Bouianger and ‘Walt Sterner, cross-
country stars.

Main threat in the dash events will
be Clyde Graf, speedy Sophomore,
who has been keeping company with
Ohl, Ferrara, and McKee as part of
the mile relay team since Larry Tre-
gonning injured his foot.

The championship meet will also
be the initial test of the current
freshman crop. Olson is deeply in-
terested in the novice turn-out as he
often discovers boys that eventually
develop into varsity letter men.

Most likely looking first place win-
ners among the freshmen appear to
be Harold Stickel in the sprints, lVIan-
nual in the distance events, Francis
Hill in the shot-put, and Red Jessup
in the high jump. Chief competition
against Jessup will be blind Bill
Kelly, who is being taught to jump by
Pete Bennett, former varsity star.

Today is the last day to turn in
entry blanks to Coach Olson and all
contestants are urged to report to the
track house tomorrow at 1 o’clock.
The meet. is open to the public.

handled by members of the faculty.
Most likely successor to Ryden’s

high and low hurdling crowns will be

Frank -Kristl, although it is doubtful
whether he will break any of '-the
Ryden records. Woodruif’s _
record of two minutes for the 880
is also reasonably safe as is Pete
Bennett’s record high jump of36 feet,
4 inches. ‘ .'  ‘ .‘

event which will be duplicated by
the other leagues if they so desire,
and a swimming meet and outdoor
track meet for each league.

Qpposes FSIM

This afternoon, the Pitt Swimming
team meets Franklin and Marshall at
Lancaster, Pa. This meet will be the
ﬁnal test in determining whether or
not Pitt will again win the Eastern
Collegiate swimming crown. Last
year the Panthers emerged with a
40-35 victory. Today’s meet is ex-
pected to be equally as close.

The Nittany Lions failed to roar
last Saturday afternoon when the
Pitt varsity and freshman swimming
teams invaded State College. The
Panther varsity slashed its way to a
'59-16 win, while the little Panthers
clawed out a 41-25 victory.

In the varsity meet, the Corrians
broke three pool records. Big Milt
Lederstein lowered the 440-yard free-
style record, while A1 Beacon did the
same to the 150—yard backstroke.
‘The other record was made by the
400-yard relay team consisting of
Beacon, Slobodian, M. Lederstein,
rand Nowotony.

Milt Lederstein and Walt Nowotony
were double winners once again.
Lederstein won the 220 and 440-yard
freestyle events, and Walt won the
50 and 100-yard freestyle sprints.

been and will continue to be the
prime aim of the intramural organ-
ization.

The three league setup which has
prevailed in both the fall and winter
program will be continued this
spring unless groups other than the
Fraternities, Engineers, and Inde-
pendents desire to form individual
leagues. The latter plan is urged.

No more than four men and no less
than two may be entered as a team
by an organization registering for
tennis, golf, or horseshoes. Only two
men may compete as a team in any
given match. Regulation nine man
teams will compete in mushball.

Inquiry Forum Hears

Men, Women Debate
R/ﬁxed Squaﬂs Eale ol: Ticlcets

Argue British
Alliance Topic

By Fred S. Robie

How the United states would
be affected by an alliance with
Great Britain, was discussed by
two mixed debating teams before
Inquiry Forum Monday.

L-oi-raine Simpson. C39, and Abe
Wolovitz, C40, upheld the proposed
alliance. Freda Jaffe, C41, and Ed-
ward Springer, C39, defended the
negative.

In the first speech, Miss Simpson
cited the rapid armament race staged
by the major powers to prove that a

Touring representatives of Syd-
ney and Melbourne universities in
Australia will oppose two senior
members of Men’s Debating Asso-
ciation on the Question of an
American alliance with European

democracies at Inquiry Forum,
Monday, in 132 Cathedral at 1
o’clock.

Discussing the question “Re-
solved: that the United States

should join with the European
democracies in a program of col-
lective security,” Hugh Robson of
Sydney university and Fred Tho-
nemann of Melbourne university,
will argue with Bernard McKen-
na, C39, and Saul Dizenfeld, C39.

general war was threatening. She
went on to give two reasons why
United States would necessarily be
thrust into the war, stating that:

First, our interest in South Amer-
ica demands it, and 2—American in-
dustrial interests will force our en-
trance in order to protect the war-
created market. On the basis of
these points, Miss Simpson advocat-
ed a military agreement and eco-
nomic sanctions for aggressor na-
tions.

As constructive speaker for. the
negative, Miss Jaffe raised objections
to the alliance. “England is the coun-
try which is deﬁnitely dependent up-
on a protected trade with her colon-
ies, she, and not the United States,
would gain from the agreement.”

In his cross-examination of Miss

‘ Simpson, Springer brought‘ out that

the combination would be economic-
ally powerful in case of war, simply
because they owned most of the
world's materials for manufacturing
war necessities.

Wolovitz, in his questioning period,
asked Miss J atfe four short questions,
namely, whether it was to the inter-
est of the United States to have peace,
to enjoy trade, and to have as neigh-
bors a friendly Canada and a friend-
ly British Guiana.

Then, he listed all the treaties
which she claimed Great Britain had
broken, and asked Miss Jaife to show
how Great Britain had broken any
part of a written agreement.

Student Body Will Vote
For Favorite Pictures

An exhibition of Camera Club art
will be on view on the eighth ﬂoor
of the Cathedral for the next two
weeks, according to Richard Nugent,

L40. The exhibition is hung in the
corridor outside the YMCA and Owl
ofﬁces.

All prints exhibited are the origin-
al work of club members. An un-
usual feature of the exhibition is that
over half have been made from min-
iatures. For the most part the pho-
tos have been enlarged many times
and have been mounted on uniform
art mountings.

Students will be given an oppor-
tunity to select the most outstanding
entries, according to Nugent. A bal-
lot box will be set up, and the prize
picture will be awarded a ribbon.

Chief contributors to the exhibi-
tion are Nugent, William Stengle,
C41; and Stanley Barish, C42.

Thomas M. Jarrett, University
photographer, praised the eﬁorts of
the contributors and pointed out sev-
eral pictures which he considered
particularly artistic. They include,
“Tranquility” and “Your Shadow”
by Barish, Nugent’s “Cathedral,” and
“Chess” by William Billinger, E42.

Later in the semester, the Camera
Club will exhibit with the freshman
camera art unit. Regina Shipman,
C40, is in charge of the unit.

All members of the faculty and the

University recently, as a group.
joined the Hospital Service Associa-
tion of Pittsburgh, according to H. E.
Dacr, assistant bursar.

G. S. Rupp, assistant treasurer, is
given credit for the organization of
the faculty group. Members of the
faculty acted with him as a commit-
tee. and answered questions of the
hospital association.

The association is a non-proﬁt
project promoted by local hospitals
to make their facilities availabale to
people who need them.

At a maximum cost of $21 per
year, a family is entitled to 21 days
hospital care. This includes general
nursing, meals and dietary service,
use of operating room and anaes-
thetic, routine laboratory service, or-
dinary medications and X-ray serv-
ice if needed.

of the economics department at the

In the six months they have been

in the road company, the girls have’

had an opportunity to visit colleges
all over the country. “That’s what
makes the trip so interesting,” said
Miss Wilson.

The Misses Stasia Wilson, Mitzi
Dare Miller, and Peggy Travers at-
tended Wellesley, Catawba, and
Hunter college respectively. The
father of one of the girls. Professor
Ralph Wilson, is a member of the
faculty of Wellesley.

In spite of the weather, the girls
liked many things about Pittsburgh.
The Cathedral of Learning, they
found found quite unique, according
to Miss Travers.

“It’s like being in a foreign coun-
try,” said Miss'Miller. “I suppose
it’s because of the nationality rooms.
It reminds me somewhat of Duke.”
Miss Miller is from North Carolina
and was a member of the New York
cast of “What a Life.”

One of the main difficulties the
girls encounter is that they are sup-
posed to keep looking like high-
school stuglents. This would not
seem especially diﬁicult as the eldest
of the three is only 21 years old.

Miss Wilson has the easiest task
