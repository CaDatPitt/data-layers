Frosh Dispute,

Rated Top News at? Semester

By George Hyde

In this last issue of The News un-
til next month, we follow our annual
custom and take a backward glance
at the campus events of this semes-
ter.

The collective opinion of the edi-
torial board of The News rates as
the outstanding campus story of the
semester the freshman football dis-
pute wnich ended in the players re-
ceiving their tuition for this semester,
and the University reaffirming its
policy of following the Code Bow-
man.

The opening of Heinz Chapel,
Tech’s football defeat of Pitt, and the
appointment of Dr. Watkins to posi-
tion of assistant administrator of the
Wage-Hour law, were stories con-
sidered by the board which tied for
second place.

The appointment of Robert Ma-
chesney as adviser to publications
was the story which placed third, the
board decided.

Following is an issue account of the
semester’s news as found in the
pages of The News:

September 20——Robert C. Maches-
ney to act as full-time adviser .
Wilber I. News-
tetter heads new-

Chaps Opening-

Dr. Clausen
Final Forum,

Group to Suggest
Future Speakers at

Any student or campus group
interested in placing a speaker in
next semester’s Inquiry Forum
series is invited to attend today ’s
meeting in 129 Cathedral at 1
o'clock when Dr. Bernard C.

church, leads the discussion on
“Student Public Affairs.”

This is the announcement made
today by the executive committee of
Inquiry Forum through John Fritz-
meier, C39, chairman.

Dr. Clausen, chairman of the board 1
of Federated Labor schools, leader of ’
Community Forum, and sponsor of
weekly radio round table discussions,
will make his ﬁrst campus appear-
ance of the year at today’s meeting.

What Dr. C1ausen’s suggestions
will be have not been disclosed at
this time. Indications, however,
point that he will probably urge stu-
dents to draft a program which will
present speakers who represent a
cross-section of progressive thought.

Last semester’s forums began with
an address by Dr. Jan Papanek,
Czechoslovak Consul, at the time of
the European crisis. Most of the pro-
grams have been conducted in the
usual style with the speaker pre-
senting his viewpoint for half an
hour and the audience questioning
in the remainder of the period.

Two of the meetings were held in
cooperation with Pitt Peace Coun-
mil. One ofthese meetings featur-
ed Pitt Players in a presentation of
Irwin Shaw’s anti-war play, “Bury
the Dear.” The other was also peace
propaganda in the form of illustrated

Dr. Geo1'§1'e lllll)l)él1'(l (‘I-app,
ch:-iii-man of the boaml of tru.steos.,
will receive file annual aw.-‘ird of
the l’i';i.sb1u'g!1 section of the
Aiiiei-icziii Chcniical Societ_\.' at a
iiieetiiip; to be held l9"e‘i)1'iizii'y 16.

The award, an inscribed aluminum
plaque, is made in recognition of
outstanding service to chemistry in
the Pittsburgh District.

Following his graduation from the
University Dr. Clapp was employed
in the machine shop of the Penn Cot-
ton mill, and later spent several
years with the Black Diamond Steel
Works, ﬁrst as a phemist, thenﬂas as-
sistant to Captain Alfred E. ‘Hunt,
who was head of the open.-hearth
department.

Later with Captain Hunt he oper-
ated the ﬁrm of Hunt and Clapp,
acquired the
Pittsburgh Testing Laboratory. Also
with Captain Hunt, Dr. Clapp was in-
strumental in bringing to Pittsburgh
Charles M. Hall and in organizing
the Pittsburgh Reduction Company,
now the Aluminum Company of
America.

Achievements in the ﬁeld of chem-
istry attended his work with Captain
Hunt and Dr. Hall. They are known
for their activities in the production
of aluminum by an inexpensixe elec-
Lrolytic process.

Notable also were his activities in
the pioneer Pittsburgh‘Testing Lab-
oratory, which provided technical
service to the growing steel industry
and which, through its experimental
ﬁltration plant led to the building of
Pittsburgh’s present ﬁltration plant‘
and the attendant enormous reduc-
tion of typhoid in Pittsburgh.

Dr. Clapp, who recently celebrat-
ed his eighti.eth birthday, was born
in Pittsburgh in 1858. He attended
the old Fourth ward school and pre-
pared for college at the Ayres Latin
school. He was graduated from the
Western University of Pennsylvania
in 1877 with the degree of bachelor
of philosophy and was named “first
scholar” in the scientiﬁc department.

Maloy to Introduce.-
Debaters at Forum

Four representatives of the varsity

debate squad will speak at Duquesne-

Community Forum tomorrow even-
ing on “The federal incorporation of
labor unions,” according to Bernard
McKenna, C3'9, manager of debate.

The student speakers will be in-
troduced by Elmer Maloy, mayor of
Duquesne.

Tomorrow’s debate will be con-
ducted in the Oregon style. Ruggero
Aldisert, C41, will deliver the affirm-
ative constructive speech; he will be
followed by Saul Dizenfeld, C39, who
will present the negative case.

Then, negative Abe Wolovitz, C40,
will cross examine Aldisert after the
two constructive speeches. In like
manner, Fred Robie, C41, will then
question Dizenfeld,

According to McKenna, this debate
will be rather unique in that both
sides are defending the cause of or-
ganized labor.

“Public opinion demands the in-
corporation of American trade
unions,” maintain Aldisert and Robie.
Wolovitz and Dizenfeld counter with
the charge that incorporation will
crush the organized labor movement.

Former Mayor MCN air Speaks
On Politics to Y Freshman Group

“Being in’ politics is fun if you can
stay out of jail” was the advice given
by former mayor William N. McNair
to members of the Friday YMCA
Freshman Club at its last weekly
meeting.

There is an increasing tendency for
better types of people to enter the
ﬁelds of politics and economics, and
Mr. McNair recommended these ﬁelds
for service and advancement.

Mr. McNair advanced two princi-
ples which he thinks will stimulate
prosperity, ﬁrst, a realization that
economics is a science, and second,
observance of the “law of location.”
He pointed out that communities
which use real estate to advantage
are more prosperous than those which
do not put good locations to work.

When asked if he would consider

running for mayor again, Mr. McNair
said, “Yes, if I can get three good
men to back me. In fact I might
run if I had a good campaign man-
ager.”

The present political situation is
none too good, he declared. How
would he improve it?

“First I’d ﬁre all the numbers mag-
istrates, and clean out the deadwood.
Although there are many good men
in politics, most of the officials are in
for money,” he said. He also advo-
cates collection of back taxes on un-
used property.

Next week, the Friday freshman
club will combine with the Thursday
club to h.ear a discussion on “Is Re-
ligion Necessary for Modern Man and
Society?”

MONDAY, JANUARY 16, 1939

Editor’s Diary

Today’s issue marks the end of the first semester as’

far as The Pitt News and its staff is concerned. We
have passed through what has probably been the most
unsettled semester in Pitt News history, and are still
doing what many of us thought highly improbable not
so long ago . . putting out a newspaper three times
a week, with editorial and news policy still in the
hands of student staff members.

We Have Progressed

from the “interim” period of mediocrity to a stage which
has returned to us most of our old self-respect and con-
ﬁdence. But we continue to be ever aware of the dan-
gers of censorship, and remain ﬁrm in our determina-
tion to resist any action which may be taken to limit
our freedom of expression.

The events of the semester are adequately reviewed
‘elsewhere in this issue. There have been dramatic prob-
lems, like the recent football controversy, vital issues
like the publications policies, the usual run of exciting
and interesting news and the customary quota of dull
and routine material.

But now at the end of the semester we ﬁnd our-
selves back

In The Old Groove ,

ﬁlling our columns with news reviews and stories about

registration and exam schedules, and worrying about

when'we’re ever going to get time enough to hand in all
our assignments and study for those nasty exams which
are almost on top of us.

Especially have we been obsessed with this ever re-
current problem of exams. We’ve always tended to go
along with that school of thought which deplores the
existence of the examination system, which contents
itself with merely presenting negative arguments in
support of its case.

But lately we’ve been doing a little thinking, and,
with the aid of a bit of rationalizing, have developed

A Substitute System
which, though we would like to be known as its origi-
nator, feel certain that many others have already come
forward with the same suggestion. Our system would
be based on a simpliﬁed grading plan, which at one time
or another has been suggested by many persons much
better qualiﬁed to do so than we.

Only two grades would be given: pass and fail.
Enough quizzes and tests or other types of evaluating
mechanisms would be given during the course of a
semester to enable the instructor to judge adequately
the capabilities of his students.

Then, at the end of the semester,
the instructor, by means of the evi-
dence on hand would draw up his
grades, and announce them to his
classes. Under this system

Automatic Exemptions
would be granted to all those who
have the mark of “P” or passing.
They would be entitled to pass the
course without further formality.
Those, however, who wind up on
the wrong side of the grade book with
an “F” or failure, would not be
doomed to complete failure but would
merely be given a conditional “F.”
Final exams would be staged exclu-
sively for their beneﬁt. Understand

there would be no compulsion, but
he lower group would merely be

complete failure or taking the exam.
Almost all, of course, will choose
the latter course. Then if they pass
the exam, they will be given a pass-
ing grade for the semester. A failing
grade, according to the standards laid
down for the test, will result only in
a complete failure for the semester.
We are the first to admit that this is

Not a New Idea

but we do think it has possibilities.
Any professor, if he is at all capable,
should be able to pass judgement on
the work and general intelligence
shown by his students over the course
of the semester.

the failing student would be given,
fairly enough, just one more chance

THE PITT NEWS

MONDAY, JANUARY 16, 1939

If I May Point . ..

. . . By Robert Saffron

The following is the farewell column of Pitt News
veteran commentator Bob Saﬁron, who, with associate
editor Sidney Shore, will soon graduate with the mid-
year class. Ave atque vale, boys!—The Editor.

1! # it

This is the last column.

But we can not be sentimental about it. College
students must be true to their analyzers and shun
such a tone. Better cynicism, weltshmertz, bombast—
but we must not be sentimental even if We choke in
the attempt.

After four years of three o'clock cramming, tea
dances, unachieved honoraries, jaggy brick walls, con-
clusionless arguments, two-thirds bluffed professors,
dim vaulted arches, heart—barings across a table,
Spring festivals, editorial diatribes, backslapping
friends, true and false exams, plaid jackets, Spinoza’s
ethics—what?

For some, nation—wide acclaim or $10,000 a year;
for most, life insurance or a gas station. And for a
while, at any rate, let’s tell ourselves it will be the
former class for us.

=!< $i= a'i=

We have had instruction in matters of high po-
tential pecuniary value; only 52 are left of the thou-
sand.that started out with us in grade school; we have
polish, poise. Let us hope, brothers . . .

And so ave atque vale to:

The Professors—-the petty and the inspiring, the
visionary and the ignorant. Most of them have fam-
ilies to support, and most of them are as lost as we
are, but they will not admit it, because what they
aspired to be, and were not, does not comfort them.
Let those of us who are to become famous not forget
these Professors, for their greatest re-nuneration is the
thought that they had a genius in their third hour,
MWF. ’

The Classes of ’42, ’4l, ’40—ﬁlled with callow youth,
who will also appoint committees of SFA, be tapped
to Druids, try to graft on dance bands. To them we
are charitable, for they are young and know not what
they are doing.

as at as

The others in the Class of ’39—We will meet again,
of course; but please, brothers, do not immediately
ask “What are you doing?”

Finally, I append a special epitaph, paraphrased
from somewhere, which anyone who wishes may ap-
propriate: '

“He tried to paint a black cat white,
He tried to lure a moth with camphor;
He fought a good, clean, honest ﬁght
For things he really gave a damn for.”

Stand-up Strike

Labor problems students at Union College, Schenec-
tady, staged a “stand—up” strike when their professor
assigned a quiz for a morning before a dance week—end

. all students, except two “scabs,” refused to take.
their seats until the professor agreed to arbitrate the
matter . . the result was a compromise, in which the
quiz was held as originally scheduled, but students were
dismissed immediately thereafter later, the pro-
fessor pointed out several ways in which students could
have improved their technique and possibly have won
completely.

ing them a needed break.

Our plan has been developed
through years of plodding laborious
thought mixed with the ever—present
doses of rationalization. It’s proba-
bly a hopeless scheme, but, neverthe-
less, we are conﬁdent that by its
very contemplation and consideration,
it may provide solace for some care-
worn and burdened soul in these try-
ing days.

By Bill Colker

When the Nazis marched into Vi-
emia to take over the city, “Grand
Illusion,” beginning its fourth week
at the Art Cinema, was being shown.
A Nazi injunction demanded its im-

mediate withdrawal, and the ﬁlm
was stopped in the middle of a reel.

Jean Renoir, author and director of
the ﬁlm, when notiﬁed in Paris of
this incident, said

he felt highly
honored. As he
put it, “I con-

sidered it a mor-
al decoration.”

the play, is a

has to do cart-wheels and slide
down bannisters in silk pajamas.

Career

By Bert Ja.ﬂ'e

With the close of the present
semester, the University of Pitts-
burgh will deliver a. diploma to
Peter Bennett.

There are many who will pay
little or no attention to the name
of Peter Bennett on the list of mid-

 The Pitt News Sports I

A
7

East All-Stars;

year graduates, but Carl Olson, head
man of the Pitt track team, is very
much concerned with that fact.

Sports followers will know Pete
as the high jumper on the Pitt
track team for the past three years.

Pete compiled a brilliant record in
his high school days at Bridgeville.
In his junior and senior years he
placed ﬁrst in the state tournament
among the high jumpers. He went.
to the inter-scholastic championship
meet in Chicago in 1933 and placed
fourth.

PhysEd Major

In the fall of 1934 Pete entered
the Pitt school of education. His
major has been physical education.
He has also received minor certi-
ﬁcations in biological science, his-
tory, and social sciences.

He has had amazing success in
varsity competition. When he ﬁrst
came to school, he used the “Western
Roll.”

However, Pete has changed his
method and now uses the “barrel
roll.” This method starts the same
as the “western” but the left leg
does not cut under the right leg and
the stomach is parallel to the bar.
The “barrel roll’ is the most eco-
nomical method for a high jumper
to get off the ground.

Earl Thompson, Navy track coach,
stated that “Bennett has his form
perfected better than any man in the
world in championship competition.”

Many foreign countries have been
the scene of “Pete’s” triumphs. He
holds the Lithuanian Olympic rec-
ord in the high jump and discus set
in Kaunos, Lithuania. At Riga, Lat-
via, he set the Baltic Countries rec-
ord in the high jump and broad
jump.

Foreign Meets

Other countries visited by Ben-
nett are England, Scotland, France,
Germany, Poland, Russia, and Swe-
den. He has traveled extensively
throughout the United States.

Bennett holds records too numer-
ous to mention. Some of his out-
standing achievements are IC4A high
jump champion in his sophomore
year. The past two years he has
placed second in this event.

The University indoor and outdoor
high jump records are listed among
his accomplishments. His indoor
record is 6 feet 3 inches set in 1937
and the outdoor record is 6 feet 5 5-8
inches made against Penn State in
1938.

Bennett’s best jump was made in
the NICAA at Minneapolis, Minne-
sota, in 1938—6 feet 61/3 inches.

Radio takes up much of Pete’s
spare time, and he intends to set up
an amateur radio station in the near
future. -

He is extremely interested in chil-
dren and enjoys teaching athletics
to them. Among the work he has
had with less fortunates is that of
teaching a crippled boy to play bas-
ketball, and aiding Bill Kelley, blind

Scott Manager

Dr. John B. Sutherland’s Pitt
football system, recognized cur-
rently as the nation’s most effec-
tive type of gridiron startegy, will
be matched against the world’s
professional New York Giants
early next autum, it was recently
learned.

First oﬁicial announcement was
made by Stanley Woodward, sports
editor of the New York Herald Tri-
bune, who honored Sutherland at a

dinner in Jack
Dempsey’s Res-
t a u r a nt. New

York. At this
time Woodward
announced Suth-
erland’s selection
as coach of the
All-East College
Stars in their
game with the
Giants to b e
played Septem-
tember 6 at the
Polo Grounds.

' T h a t t h i s
game, sponsored jointly by the Her-
ald Tribune and the New York
World’s Fair Committee under Gro-
ver Whalen, wouldbe a match be-
tween the professional game’s best,
the New York Giants, and collegiate
football’s best, the Pitt method of
play, was indicated strongly by word
from New York, revealing that there
will be a predominance of Pitt play-
ers in the Sutherland-coached All-
East team.

While the selection of Pitt players
has not yet been announced, one
Panther luminary’s inclusion in the
personnel was revealed. He is Frank
Scott, Pitt varsity football manager
of equipment during the past year,
who has been chosen as Sutherland’s
manager for the All—East team.

This means, among other things,
that Scott, ﬁrst selected as an All-
American manager in early October
by Leonard Levison, sports editor of
the Pitt News, and later chosen man-
ager on the Pitt News’ All-City
team, is now recognized as such by
one of the nation’s leading gridiron
critics, Stanley Woodward, who made
the selection.

Scott, ﬁrst manager of equipment
in Pitt history, is responsible for the
introduction of a new system of grad-
ing football managers. He is con-
sidered one of the outstanding man-
agers Pitt football has ever had.

Scott will be ofﬁcially honored at
a banquet to be given by Edward
Levison in Gammon’s Hilanhouse.

This Duquesne team has been hail- 
ed as the greatest outﬁt to dribble out i
of the Bluff in a great many years;i
and the ﬁrst team includes nothing:
but sophomores. The Pitt- Duquesne E

After two and a half months of¢

con’s specialty is the 150-yard back-
stroke, but he swims both the 200-
breaststroke and freestyle equally
well. Hymie Lederstein’s breast-
stroke and freestyle work will also
be a contributing factor to the team’s
success.

Felix Kierbicz should continue
pressing Milt Lederstein for 440 hon-
ors. Bob Schrader, Dick Raley, and
Dill, round out the “Corrians” varsity
roster.

Coach Corr is also pleased with the
showing of the freshmen swimmers
working out daily in the Trees pool.
In Joe Orloff, Corr has a new free-
style threat. Harry Tish, a local boy,
also shows great promise.

Cosgove and Sullivan, breast-
stroke neophytes, have repeatedly
won decisions against the varsity in

this event. Cosgrove is a former
Homestead Library swimmer and
Sullivan is the present A. M. A.
champion.

The Hilltoppers have been travel-
ing at a sizzling pace the past few

to rather than detracted from the

value of the discussion.”
