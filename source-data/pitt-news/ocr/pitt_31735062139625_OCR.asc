Tri-Weekly

150 Applicants
Expected To Try
For Cap, Gown

Graduate Club Solicits Musical
Compositions Of Students
For “In The Soup”

 

Routine Tomorrow

The thrill that comes once in a
lifetime for many producers and direc-
tors may be in store for Ted Vieh-
man and Ruth Miller this evening.
Comparable to the enthusiasm of
Balboa in discovering the Paciﬁc
and David Belasco in seeing some of
his “ﬁnds” rise to the entertainment
v.'0I‘l(l’s top strata, might be that of
Cap and Gown’s production and
chor11s directors, respectively, if they
can ﬁnd a budding great in the line-
up at the Y hut.

Approximately 150 applicants are
expected at 8:45 o’clock tonight in
the quest for positions in the annual
all-men's’ musical show. Page Ruth
St. Denis, Arthur Murray, and the
dancing master of the Ballet Russe,
for a bevy of beautiful, graceful,
high-stepping, prospective chorines
with slightly‘ enlarged biceps. and
calves "are" anticipated.’

The tryout tonight is more of a prep-
aration for the actual routine work
rather than immediate start of rehear-
sals. It will be directed toward in-
structing and limberingthe new men
so that they might stand a better
chance of surviving the eliminations
when in line with the experienced
Cap and -Gowners.

The Graduate club will hold a meet-
ing at the Y hut Wednesday evening
at 9:30 o'clock when it will hear sev-
eral musical numbers submitted by
students. Theodore W. Biddle, as-
sistant dean‘ of men and chairman of
the production committee, wants all
men who have submitted numbers
to be present at this meeting. The
Graduate club wants the students to
play the numbers themselves. Any-
one else interested in writing ‘music
for “In the Soup” should see Mr.
Biddle immediately to get the situa-
tion for the music.

There will be a meeting of the Un-
dergraduate Cap and Gown club pro-
duction and. business committees _in
Room 821, Cathedral, at 3:30 o’clock.
Plans for the Tuesday and Wednes-
day evening eliminations will be dis-
cussed.

Cap and Gown’s bouillion will be
dished out to the ‘Shrine as per for-
mer years but the Allegheny County
ifivic club will be unable to sponsor
an evening due to the fact that it pa-
tronized the opening night of “As
Thousands Cheer,” recent show at
3. downtown theater.

' ill-advised

University Free

Of Propaganda,
Hallock Opines

So far as the University is concern-
ed, it is freer of Communistic propa-
ganda and unbridled radicalism than
any other educational institution in
the country.

Following protests of John W. Hal-
lock’s radio address last week in
which he declared “one of the great-
est. menaces to our nation is the sin-
ister inﬂuence of unbridled radical-
ism,” the alumni secretary told The
Pitt News: _

“I do not think we have anything
to fear at this University. Pitt stu-
dents are intelligent, reasonable and
sensible.

“Most of them make sacriﬁces to
attend the University. They are more
interested in studying objectively the
various systems of economy and in
making the most of their educational
opportunity than in participating in
reform movements.”

Mr. I-Iallock, a lieutenant colonel in
the Corps of Engineers’ Reserves,

-and alumni secretary, spoke in con-

nection with National Defense VVeek.
He said:

“Plastic and immature minds of
youth should not be submitted to the
inﬂuence of malicious
propagandists and would-be reform-
ers.”

To this some students asked if he
were referring to the University. Mr.
Hallock replied:

“Absolutely not. In an address of
this kind, a speaker cannot address
himself to or of a special group.”

He believed students “on the whole
are not easily stampeded.” Minori-
ties always advocate extreme meas-
ures, he said, and the “accompanying
ballyhoo is sometimes mistaken for
the voice of the majority.”

Second Newsreel
To Be Presented

Group Expects Larger Crowd At
Showing,-This Wednesday

 

 

More than _"..50 students attended
the ﬁrst showing of the SPA News-

reel at the Schenley theater —Wednes-.

day. Although the number was some-
what smaller than the committee had
expected, an increase is anticipated
as theproject becomes more familiar

to the student
body.

“We expect a
larger crowd at

the next perform-
ance on Wednes-
day,” said Charles
Herald, ‘C36, chair-
man of the com-
mittee, “as the
program is being
endorsed by many
of the faculty. Be-
sides, the screening
committee, in the
light of comments that have been
made will be’ better able to select
ﬁlms of genuine interest to students
and faculty.”

The following promotion commit-
tee has been appointed. Roger ‘Han-
son, C, Elmer Schreiber, BA, Robert
Mease, ED, James Nicholas. E, Mor-
ris Rosenbloom, fraternities; Sylvia
Fixel, WSGA; James Thompson and
Joseph Rosenberg, publicity.

Fine Arts Films
To Be Screened
Tomorrow Night

Department Promises Interest,
Dramatic Value To Students
In European Movies

-Maybe you don’t “parlez francais,”
and maybe you aren’t acquainted with
artistic elements, but the ﬁne arts de-
partment promises that you will ﬁnd
“Le Chien Andalou” and “Poil de
Carotte" of absorbing interest and of
great draniatic value.

These two ﬁlms, the first in a series,
will be screened tomorrow evening at
8:15 o’clock in Room 817, Cathedral.
Students are invited to attend the
showing "free of charge.

The departn1en't’s new Victor sound
projector has already been tested in
Room 817. A cellotex diaphragm will
be installed to help sound effects.

“We should like to correctpthe im-
pression that these pictures are
‘arty,’ ” said, Philip C. Elliott, assist-
ant professor of ﬁne arts. ’ “They are"
really excellent in plot, in characteriz-
ation, in photography, and in direc-
tion. All movie-goers with a taste
for perfection will ﬁnd them extreme-
ly gripping.” ,

Mr. Elliott will give an explanatory
ta.lk on each ﬁlm to introduce the un-
derlying artistic elements. Rather
than present a. technical discussion,
he will clarify only certain ﬁne points.

“Le Chien Andalou,'’ which translat-
ed means “the werewolf,” is a silent
picture directed by Salvador Dali,
whose painting, “Enigmatic Ele-
ments in a Landscape,” received hon-
orable mention at the Carnegie Inter-
national Art exhibition. The ﬁlm is
a famous example of surrealist
tl_1ought,- a new school of art expres-
sion.

“Poil de Carotte,” or “the red-head,”
is a French talkie with English sub-
titles. It should be especially inter-
esting to psychology students for its
portrayal of the sensitive nature of
a little boy and the inﬂuence of his
family upon him. .

Other ﬁlms which the department,
under the direction of Walter R.
Hovey, acting head, has planned for
future showing include “White Hell
Of Pitz P3111.” “A Nous La Liberte,”

“Potemki-us,” by Eisenstein, and “Le

Million” by Rene
French director.

According to Mr. Hovey, students
will ﬁnd this an excellent opportunity
to see ﬁlms not purely industrial and
not connected with Hollywood. They
may ﬁnd a basis of comparison be-
tween ﬁlms purely commercial, pure-
ly artistic, and those combining both
qualities. It is hoped that the possi-
bilities of the movies as an art form
may be developed.

Three performances will be held
this spring. If the project is a suc-
cess, it may be developed into an ex-
perimental laboratory for productions
from an artistic point of view.

Savoyard Will Address 

Group Here Tomorrow

Clair, the famed

Martyn Green, member of the
cast of the D'Oyly Carte Opera
company which opens tonight at
a downtown theater, will speak
before a meeting of students dur-
ing the ﬁfth hour tomorrow aft-
ernoon in Room 1309, Cathedral.

Mr, Green’s~ appearance in the
nationality rooms studio was ar-
ranged by Roger Hanson, C36,
chairman of the Speakers’ com-.
mittee of SFA.

He has made personal appear-
ances at Princeton and Yale.

Labor Growls, Industry Satisﬁed
With NRA’s Gains, Tyson Asserts

By Roman ‘Lapica

Ending the NRA would be as tough

as “unscrambling an omelet.”
' So declared Dr. Francis D. TYson,
professor of economics, in an address
before the Pennsylvania Conference
on Social Welfare last week.

“I ﬁnd a real gain over loss in the
two years’ experience of the NRA,”
Dr. Tyson said. “Industry seems
more than satisﬁed . labor may
growl but would not think of oppos-
ing the continuance of NRA in sub-
stantially its present form . the
consumer has beneﬁted in the higher
hourly wages and enhanced employ-
ment.”

The whole nation has gained, the
professor asserted. The evils of cut-
throat competition “are limited by
the codes.” The new attitudes “may
open a new and brighter day for in-
dustrial relations in America.”

Dr, Tyson predicted an average rise
in prices of 1 per cent a month in
1935. This, he believes, “will serve
to stimulate expansion of production
and incomes, so easing the vast debt
burden and hastening us on the way.
to a lasting reco 'ery.”

On the whole, Dr. Tyson said, the
result “has been good despite eco-
nomic pitfalls and the roarings of
General Johnson.” He foresaw bet-
ier results for the next two years.

As for scrapping the NRA, Dr. Ty-
son saw the movement as a “dust
storm of publicity from reactionary
small business, political radicals and
revolutionaries who desire the de-
pression to continue."

§Dr. Tyson said later to The Pitt

News, that the Townsend old age pen-
sion bill is as “dead as a dodo.”

Speaking on the president’s message
to Congress, he said it was a, “forceful
and discriminating message, present-
ing a decisive case for the continuance
of the NRA."

Sterilization As Crime
Buffer Called Ineffective

Sterilization because it rests upon
“two fallacious assumptions,” cannot
be effective as a crime preventative.

Speaking before the Pennsylvania
Conference on Social Welfare, which
ended Saturday, Dr. Vvalter E. Lun-
den, instructor in sociology, declared
that results to limit the spread or
crime have proved “discouraging.”

“Sterilization,” he said, “rests on
the assumption that only a small
share of offenders are involved, there-
fore you do not reach the many. Sec-
nndly, sterilization implies that crime
is hereditary and that by removing
the anti-social parent we remove the
uiidesirable juvenile. This is an er-
ror. Criminals, are not born, but
made.”

Dr. Lunden asserted that attempts
to treat the criminal in penal insti-
tutions “have not proved successful.”
He referred to prisons as “penal in-
stitutions and not places where men
are regenerated.”

"Each community,” he concluded,
“should have a centralized program
in which police, schools, clubs, settle-
ment houses, amusement and recrea-
tion centers are coordinated. If we
are seeking a practical method to pre-
vent crime, this is one of the few
which warrants attention.”

side of three questions: Resolved,
that the nations should agree fto_pre-
vent the international shipmei1t‘of‘
arms; Resolved, that the nations
should agree to nationalize the pro-

expansion of foreign trade is essen-
tial for the return of American pros-
perity.

The team of two men-to be selected
will. meet the following southern
schools: University of Kentucky at
Lexington; Knoxville college at Knox-

ville, Tennessee; Vanderbilt univer-
sity at Nashville, Tennessee; Bir-
mingham-Southern college at Bir-

Reich, C36, and the negative consist-
ing of Edwin Banks, C35, and Alvin
Foraker, C37, discussed the question
of nationalization of munitions be-
fore a League of Women Voters

held on Friday, March 8, when the
Association will debate, before the
Pittsburgh Chamber of Commerce,
and, on Monday, March 18, before the

McMillan Urges‘ Voters
To Correct Corruption

“If the people would get out and
vote, dangers of corruption in the
minor judiciary would be lessened,”
declared Andrew W. McMillen, presi-
dent of the Minor Judiciary and Con-
stable Association of I/Vestern Penn-
sylvania, at the weekly meeting of
Inquiry I/Vednesday. “We realize
that thepossibilities are great of un-
ﬁt men being elected to office, despite
the work of our organization. The
voters instead of complaining about
it should remedy this situation on
election day.”

Squire l\~lcl\/Iillen devoted the major
portion of his discussion to a defense
of the minor judiciary in regard to
the statements concerning it made by
Attorney VVilliam S. Doty before In-
quiry three weeks before.

HANCELLOR, who referred a pre-

liminary report of the American
Association of University Professors,
and his own reply, to the executive
committee of the Board of Trustees.’

Bowman Upholds
Private Donations

Chancellor Applauds Hearst
Drive, Asking Citizens’ Support

By John Tibby

“If the State of Pennsylvania
wants to take over the University
of Pittsburgh we have no. quarrel
to offer. If it's going to: though,
let it see that the University is
thoroughly sustained." '

Thus Chancellor John G. Bowman
raised a challenge to the issue of in-
creased State control of the Univer-
sity, during an address Friday at the
Washington's Birthday luncheon of
the Pittsburgh chapter of the Daugh-
ters of the American Revolution.

The address, introduced as a dis-
cussion of “Current patriot_i_sm,”
sketched the Chancellor’s view of the
service of university education in con-
temporary America and then consid-
ered in quick turn issues before the
University of Pittsburgh.

He praised William Randolph
Hearst for his “expose” of Commun-

ism and said that the publicist was
"entitled to the encouragement and
support of intelligent citizens.”

He did not refer by name to Dr.
Ralph Turner, nor except indirectly
to the controversy over the history
professor's dismissal. '

To the possibility of -State control
of the University the -Chancellor de-
clared he had notobjection, “if ‘State
control’ were not ‘political control.’
He reminded the D. A. R. of the
growth of the University from pri-
vate gifts aggregating $21,00'0_.00-0 in
10 years and expressed his doubt that
the state-controlled universities of
Iowa, Kansas, Vvisconsin and Minne-
sota, together had received one-foiu
tieth as much from private sources in
the same period.

The Chancellor emphasized:

‘‘If the State of Pennsylvania
wants to take over the University
of Pittsburgh we have no quarrel
to offer. If it's going to, though,
let it see that the University is
thoroughly sustained. Private gifts
must not be shut off.

“Now, the University is receiving
about half a million dollars a year
from the State. If they'll make it
two and a half millions, God bless
Pennsylvania and let them take it!"

After describing the educated per-
son as one within whom “kindness,
good sense and understanding” have
been joined, the Chancellor said that
“interest in social policies” has es-
pecially marked the educated person
during the last 50 years:

“That is good. It ought to be en-
couraged. It’ is encouraged. That
way lies our common good.”

But “in recent years,” according to
Dr. Bowman, propaganda destructive
to education and religion has been set
in motion under excuses of freedom.
Propagandists, he warned, have
sought in “freedom” the right “to de-
stroy without assuming a sense of
responsibility.” He continued:

“I feel on solid ground, therefore,
when I demand that every professor
show patriotism and reverence. To
me, that’s plain duty and common
sense.”

Next Dr. Bowman applauded the cf-
forts of Vvilliam Randolph Hearst, “in
sliowiiig the sources of this controver-
sy” between responsibility and irr-.-2-
sponsibility, and asked. for the sup-
port of Hearst by intelligent citizens.
To an inquirer, after the address, Dr.
Bowman mentioned that he had not
attempted to discuss other policies of
the Hearst papers.

Following Dr. Bowman's conclusion,
in which he said, referring to the sa-
lute of the American flag by the D. A.
1-’... that he wanted “the University of
Pittsburgh 100 per cent faithful to the
ﬂag of the United States,” the audi-
ence of more than 100 women rose and
applauded. Dr. Bowman was told:
“Tho D. A, R is right with you and
behind you.” . . - ..

First Tension After
Release Of AAUP
Report Diminishes

Dr. Oliver Criticizes Committee’s
Statement Charging Damage
To Faculty Self-Respect

 

 

Turner Noncommittal

 

Complete copies of the pre.
liminary AAUP report may be
had at the office of the business
manager, State hall, Mr. Weber
told The News.

VVl1ile students, members of the
faculty and administration, and
The Pitt.News took a week-end
holiday Ill gratitude to George
\Vaslungton_: while the first ten-
S1011 wrought by the sudden re-
lease of the AAUP’s preliminary
report relaxed into personal convic-
tions; while Saturn blinked in the
east and life went on:

Faculty members sought complete
copies of the report, in most cases re-
fusing comment on what they called

newspaper summaries" or “newspa.
per mosaics." ' '

Dr. John W’. Oliver, head of the de-
partment of history, pointed warmly
to a quot_at1on from the report that
charged ‘irreparable damage” to have
been “indicted on the self respect of
every man and woman on the faculty
who has ever dared to think and act
in terms of principles,” and predicted:

“If that’s a sample of what‘ the
report IS to be, it cannot fail to be
shot through with venom, animus,
bias, and deliberate slander.”

D1‘; Ralph E. Turner, the professor
Of h1St0I'Y Whose dismissal la.st June
caused an investigation of the Uni-
versxty, passed through Pittsburgh be-
fore daylight Friday morning en route
from New York to Sioux City, where
his mother is recovering from an op-
eration, and refused to discuss the re-
port or Chancellor Bowman's reply.
“I’d rather wait until the report is is-
sufdd by the National Committee,” be
sa .

Members of the history department

“S9-1‘l'011S1Y objected" to forming im-

pressions from newspaper accounts,
predicted that a “partisan organiza-
tion” could be expected to produce
only a “partisan report rather than a.
judicial criterion," or saw “an uncon-
cealed animus there” in newspaper se-
lections. ,

Other faculty members who were
willing to offer impressions took the
investigating committee to task for
criticising the City of Pittsburgh. One
member submitted:

“They admit their own weakness,
when in order to indict the Univer-
sity they indict the City of Pitts-
burgh. One might‘ as well hold the
University of Chicago responsible
for Al Capone."

The report's criticism of the one-
year contract system, in use at the
University, was seconded by several
faculty members, who admitted the
plan made tenure uncertain.

In Harrisburg, legislation was in
preparation to make a State appro-
priation this spring contingent on a
change in the Board of Trust.ees; and
Assemblyman Herman P. Eberharter,
of the University’s home district,
called for an investigation of the
school.

Dr. Oliver declared he would “wel-
come any fair investigation that any-
body wants to make,” and another
member of the history department
emphasized, “If we're honest, the
world ought to know about it.”

Meanwhile -Chancellor Bowman told
a meeting of local D. A. R. that State
control of the University would re-
quire a much heavier State appropria-
tion, concluding:

“Now, the University is receiving
about half a million dollars a year
from the State. If they'll make it
two and a half millions, God bless
Pennsylvania and let them take it!"

‘Magda’ Audience
Votes Approval

Director Satisﬁed, Though “Play
Dragged In Second Act”

By Ray Maclntyre

“I was quite well satisﬁed with
Vvednesday night's performance of
Magda,” replied Carl B. Cass, faculty
director of Pitt Players, when solic-
ited for an opinion, “I wearied some-
what in the second act when it be-
gan to drag, but it picked up nicely
in the third.”

The audience, too, seemed to like
Magda. Scraps of conversation picked
up in the lobby of the YMl—IA after
the performance were highly lauda-

tory: “'Wondert'ul performance - .”
—-“Fine play .”—“A very excel-
lent job” .-—“Quite professional
in many spots . .”—“Very good, in-
deed .” and other apropos re-

marks were exchanged freely.

True, at times certain members of
the audience hardly seemed to indi-
cate appreciation when they tittered
at inauspicious moments, but this
was atoned for when they remained
perfectly rigid during the closing
scene.

Turner Case

HE TURNER case fails to
bring joy from whatever angle
it is observed, the cxultation to
the contrary notwithstanding of
patriotic societies and commerce

chambers. And presumably the
Church, which was described as a
defendant in the case, is with-
holding; hosannas until the last
judgment.

If it is dubitable whether the

dismissal of Dr. Turner has
strengthened or weakened the
University “in the World of the

existing Pittsburgh, with its ex-
tremes of riches and poverty, ’.’ it
is, undoubted that the dismissal
places the University a suspect
among liberal institutions. It
may be answered that only in

Pittsburgh can Pittsburgh causes ‘

be properly judged; that only
here will the opinion of men and
the services of the University
have their ﬁnal value.

“It is entirely possible,” states
the current draft of the AAUP
report, “that in years to come,
when the smoke of current con-

 

ﬁicts has blown away and the

hurts and grievances occasioned
by the present focusing of cﬁort
on the Cathedral are forgotten,
the sentiment a11d the vision of
the Chancellor will be vindicated.
It may be that the Chancellor is
evcrlastingly right . . .” It may
be that the dismissal of Ralph
Turner, and men like him with
vigorous and dissenting social
opinions, will be vindicated later.

But wounds have been dealt to
the present.

A time when confused persons
are seeking rational adjustment
in an irrational present is a time
when even irreverence and savage
criticism may have their uses.
There are times for the incisive
acid of Dean Swift.

Supreme Court Powers Need New Interpretation —— Banks

By Edwin Banks

FTER. VVEEKS of delay, procras-
tination which kept the whole
nation in a state of nervous appre-
hension, the Supreme Court ﬁnally
rendered 21 five to four decision on the
gold clause last Monday. The verdict
saved the New Deal adininistration a
doubt, by

disturbing question. At the time, the
public, durin,g_the. le_ng_tl_iy_ huddle of
our federal referees, wasgiven ample
opportunity to consider another vital
question—the value of Supreme Court
in our governmental system.

Almost since the birth our govern-
ment under the present Constitution
of 1789, the Supreme Court has acted
as the ultimate interpreter of the doc-
ument and has determined whether

legislation of Congress was in agree-‘

ment with the fundamental law of the
land.

The source of the Court’s highly
signiﬁcant power was discovered, you
will remember,--by the Court itself.
That eminent El+‘edera.list, John Mar-
shall, in his most famous decision,
Ivlarbury vs. Madison, decided that
the Judiciary could pass on the con-
stitutionality of measures enacted by
the legislative branch.

The logic used by the ‘Chief Justice

to prove his point was peculiar, to

say the least. The Supreme Court,
he declared, had taken oath to sup-
port the Constitution; hence, the Jus-
tices were duty bound to see to it that
Congress and the President did not
transcend their legal functions. 
shall apparently neglected to point
out the fact that Congress and the
President had taken the identical
oath and with similar logic could do-

fend their right to judge for themsel-

ves the constitutionuality of their ac-
The validity of Marbury vs,
Madison has therefore been attacked
by presidents, jurists, and political
scientists as questionable because it
is based on a fallacious. syllogism, al-
though many framers of the Consti-
tution, it is true, believed that the
Supreme Court had been delegated
the power. '

In other words, the Supreme Court.
has been obstructing the work of
Congress, upholding conservatism and

Court resolves itself into this:

reaction, meddling with purely polit-
ical subjects, whittling away the au-
thority of federal commissions, and in
general blocking the legislative ad-
vancement of our country siniply by
virtue which is held in low repute by
students of government.

That is not to maintain that the
Court has never given a liberal ver-
dict or that it has never been domin-
ated by great men interested in pub-
lic ‘b’efore«. private .- welfare. The pres-
ent gold clause decision and the rec-
ords of ex-Justice Holmes and Justice
Brandeis are notable examples to the
contrary. But the work of the judic-
iary when weighed in the balance of
national progress will be found want-
ing.

Vi-'hi1e the activity of the seven or
nine justices throughout our history
is supposed to have been based mere-
ly on. the cold scientiﬁc process of
studying a disputed law, comparing it
with the Constitution, and ﬁnding a
conformity or a conﬂict between the
two; their actual. methods of.reason-
ing have been much ﬁiore complex.
Any student of the stiff course in Con-
stitutional law at the Unive.rsii._v will
tell you that the Court has based its
verdicts from time to time on amaz-
ingly »v-aried analyses, ‘Sometimes
its conclusions have rested on the cit-
ing of precedents, sometimes on the
evidence of history, sometimes on a
vague something, labelled “inherent”
rights, sometimes on a combination
of two or more of these, and some-
times on‘ apparently nothing at all.

In almost every case involving a
fundamental question of public policy,
the .l'11stic.es have but thinly disguised
their personal‘ sentiments. After all,
they are only human. They have

ideas about economics, politics, and

morals. And when such a case comes
up, they have already formed an opin-
ion in their own minds as to whether
the legislation in question is “good”
for the country or “bad.” It is for
this reason, that their logic positively
stum.ps political science students so
often. The Court wants to decide a

case in a certain way; its main task

then is to rationalize as convincingly
as possible.

The whole problem "of the Supreme
when

_-——both Congress and the

it concerns itself with Congressional

legislation, it is acting in a legisla-

tive capacity. V\"e-have the Senate
and the House of Representatives to
handle legislative matters. We don’t
need the services of any other branch
of our government in this respect.

Over in England, Parliament de-
cides for itself whether its enact-
ments arc constitutional—and Eng-
land does have a body of fundamental
laws and rights which collectively
compose a sort of constitution. Thus
its work is not impeded by any Olllm‘
agency. British voters stand back of
Parliament; if they disapprove of its
attitude, they elect new members to
it. Legislative action represents more
closely the will of the people at the
moment; it is not hampered by re-
strictive power of old men whose
ideas were out of date 20 years be-
fore.

The United States should adopt the
British system and end once and for
all the trouble that the Supreme
Court has stirred up. This does not
mean th'at‘tl1e Court should be~abc:~l—
ished. It performs much useful work
in other jurisprudential ﬁelds. It is a
necessary agent of the national gov-
erntment in determining whether
state laws conﬂict with national laws,
and so forth. But it should deﬁnitely
end its interference with the business
of Congress.

This proposal is not at all original.
In fact, I am sorry to disappoint you
conservatives in admitting that it is
not even radical. Reniember ﬁrst of
all what has already been mentioned

have taken oath to support the Consti-
tution, just as the Justices have. Then
recall that three of our most famous
presidents opposed the Supreme
Court’s assumption of the power in
question————Je'ffe1'son, Jackson and Lin-
coln.

Perhaps it might be well to close
with quotation from the Great Eman-
cipator, whose words are so often ad-
vanced as infallible proof of any ar-
gument. In his first inaugural ad-
dress when he attacked the notorious
Dred Scott decision, Lincoln said:

Cagers Have Eye
On Owl Feathers
Here Wednesday

Great Temple Trio Makes Last
Appearance In Pittsburgh
In Battle With Panthers

There are one or two things which
the Panther cagers are anxious to
clear up when they put on a little
battle with the Temple Owls a.t the
stadium pavilion Vvednesday night.
First, there is the matter of a 45-38
licking which the Philadelphia boys
meted out to the Cats as a sort of
surprise package at Philly last
month.

Then, too, the Owls are likely to be
the outﬁt which the Panthers must
beat out to gain their third straight
Eastern Intercollegiate conference
title, Temple meets Carnegie Tech in

If that prof of yours winces a little
as he swings his arm up to write the
test questions on the board on a Tues-
day morning, you needn't suspect that

he's getting old or that he’s bother-
ed with a touch of rheumatism. It’s
just the morning after the night be-
fore, and the night before, besides be-
ing Monday night, is faculty bowling
night.

They'll take time off again this eve-
ning from marking quiz papers, read-
ing English themes, and checking
book reports in order to roll ’em down
toward the pins at the Strand alleys
at 8 o'clock.

Tonight’s series of matches will be
the tenth since the first pin was
smacked down by a professorially-
propelled ball in the group meetings.
In that time most of the faculty mem-
bers have boosted their average to a

Philadelphia tonight and the result of§ma1'k 0103913’ i1DI>1'0aChi11g their golf

battle will perhaps have more than a
little to do with the standings in the
league.

The Owls started out like a. house
aiire this season and romped off with
nine straight victories before they
ran up against NYU’s crack outﬁt
and came out on the short end of a
22-38 count. Vi-Ihile Temple was stag-
gering from that blow. West Virginia
stepped in with a. stiff uppercut and
the Tech Tartans delivered another
telling smash to the Owl tai1—feathers.
Thus in the short space of ﬁve d’ ys,
the Temple supporters saw their un-
defeated hopes go bouncing three
times on the rocks.

Since then the fortunes of Coach
Jimmy Usilton and_ his men have
found a little better favor. CCNY
licked them and Purdue sneaked over’
a one-point win, but the Owls have
won all the rest. The recent mas-
sacre of Bucknell, in which the Tem-
ple tossers hung up a total of 71
markers, is plenty of proof that
Rosan, Fox, and the rest of the lads
are still capable of dropping them in.

For three of the Owls, the game
‘Wednesday night will be their last
appearance in ‘Temple togs before
Pittsburgh fans. Harold Rosan, Jim-
my Brown, and Charlie Freiberg are
the seniors rounding out three years
of varsity competition. Rosan is the
red-head who has been unanimous
choice for the all-conference team
during the past two years. He led
the league in scoring when he was a
sophomore.

Brown is a one-man team, being
adept at any position on the ﬂoor.
The fastest player the Owls have, he
is now doing duty at a guard post.
Freiberg is the third member of the;
trio of seniors, all of whom made'
high school basketball history as
members together of the Southern
high team of Philadelphia before en-

rolling at. Temple. ’Feibergv plays
guard and is an accurate long-shot
performer,

For the Panthers, .it need only be
said that it’s tough to lick a Carlson
team twice-in one season. Ask the
Dukes.

Kappa Sigma. Leads “B” League;
Three Tied In “A” Section

Tomorrow night from 7 o’clock un-
til 9 o’clock in the Trees gymnasium,
Greek passers in League “B” clash in
three very important tilts.

In the first game, Lambda Chi
Alpha will attempt to climb above the
.500 mark in its encounter with SAE.
The second game will perhaps be the
most important one of the evening.
At this time, the pace-setting Kappa
Sig courtmen will attempt to keep
clean their record of victories when
they take on their Phi Delt neigh-
bors.

Pi Kappa. Alpha’s undefeated ﬁve
will also be out to add to its victory
string at Phi K.appa’s expense in the
last. important fray of the evening.

In pennant-bearing contests VVed-
nesday, Kappa Sigma. whipped Phi
Kappa in the first game, 30-12. The
7 o'clock game, scheduled between Pi
K A and Sigma Alpha Epsilon, was
postponed.

Lambda Chi Alpha. thoroughly
trounced Phi Delta Theta by the over-
whelming score of 45 to 16, in the 9
o’clock affair. '

John Michelosen, working the hole
in the Kappa Sig offensive drives,
pivoted and popped neatly eight ‘times
during the game to lead both teams
in points with a total of 18.

Ave Daniell was outstanding in
completely submerging the Phi Delt
hopes in the late game. Lambda Chi

Alpha scored at will throughout the
contest. '
On Tuesday. Pi Lambda Phi

romped away from Sigma Alpha Mu
in League “A” by a 37 t.o 14 margin.
Sigma Chi also repeated against Phi
Epsilon Pi, 14-12, to tie for leadership
with the Pi Lams and Delis. Delta
Tau Delta tookpthe measure of Phi
Gamma Delta, 38-27, to complete the
evening of hostilities.

Meet Union High

Diﬁicult Schedule Of Events To
Hamper Pitt Team

 

The freshman swimming team will
meet the natators from Turtle Creek
Union high school tomorrow after-
noon at 4,o’c1ock in the Turtle Creek
pooL

The Union high swimmers are un-
defeated so far this season and are
set to take the Little Panthers into
camp. Coach Peresenyi has another
strong squad this year. In past
meets with Union, although the fresh-
men have always come out the vic-
tors, the meets have always been very
close.

A rather difficult order of events
will be used in this meet. The two
freestyle events, 40‘ and -100'ryard dash
come in order. This handicaps the
Panthers inasmuch as the 40-yard
swimmers are practically the only
men on the squad capable of swim-
ming a fast 100-yard race.

The following order of events will
be used: 40-yard freestyle, 100-yard
freestyle, 100-yard breaststroke, 100
yard backstroke, medley, diving, and
freestyle relay. «

All members of the team are re-
quested to report in front of State Hall
promptly at 3:30 o’clock_ Members
with cars are asked to bring them to
facilitate the transportation problem.

Freshman students interested in
trying for the freshman squad are re-
quested to report to Trees Pool this
afternoon at 5 o’clock for practice.
Competitive’ swimming experience is
not a, reo,uireme:ut that candidates
must fulfill. ’ ' '
