donate to Pitt's biannual
Greek Week blood drive.

In the photo to the left,
Pitt junior Annmarie Lynch’
consults with nurse Ber--

Ken Kumer, co-chairman
of" Greek Week, said there
is a great need for do-
nations.

"After the Christmas
holidays there is usually a
blood shortage,” Kumer
said.

The blood drive is spon-
sored by Pitt's Greeks,
whom compete for the
most pints donated.

The Greeks hold blood
drives in January and in
March. Their goal is to’
raise 1,500 pints of blood.

The drive will continue
both today and tomorrow
from 12 p.m. to 6 p.m.’in

4.7 million students in debt for college

“By Dirk Kaufman

Managing Editor

The demands of paying for col- '
' Iege may be changing the Ameri-

can dream and, some say, may
change the nation itself._

The Joint Economic Committee
of Congress has prepared a report
that focuses on the fear of creat-
ing a ”debtor generation.”

0 Education cuts proposed, page 7

The current trend in methods of
financing a college education
may be placing unwanted burden
not only on graduates but also ‘on
the federal government, which
foots the bill for many loans.

According to the report, 4.7 I

million students borrowed
money to assist in paying for col-
lege last year. This amount is
three times the amount who bor-
rowed 10 years ago. Because of
this, one-third to one-half of col-
lege graduates are leaving colleg

in debt. . '

The problem is complicated by

the fact that the number of well— '

paying jobs available to graduates
has decreased since 1979.

College students, according to

the report, are in debt $6,685 and

$8,950 for public and private

schools upon graduation, respec-
tively. ‘

The problems "with potential
debt andan increased reliance on
student loans may be affecting
not only how many young men
and women will attend college in
the future, but also who will

attend. -
’/Growing student indebted-

ness has raised questions about
the implications of the debt bur-
dens for the national economy,”
the report stated. These questions
come up again, according to the
report, when considering ”the
equality of access to higher edu-
cation, the economic well—being
of borrowers and even the educa-
tional process itself.”

While stating the extensive
concerns in these areas, it also
pointed out and criticized the fact
that information on the current
status of student loans is either
unreliable or simply unavailable.

”We don't want to ignore that
evidence,” said Janet S. Hansen

in the report. ”But we don't want I

to assume we have a problem
when we don’t.” _ -

Over the last decade federal
loans have replaced grants as the
major source for tuition as-

sistance, according to the report.

_ Borrowing from federal programs

has increased by almost $8 bil-
lion in the last 10 years while use
of grants and scholarships has
decreased by $2 billion in that
same period.

Hansen said in the report that
the purpose of federal loans has
strayed from its original focus of
minimally subsidized loans to
middle-income families to high-
ly” subsidized loans for needy
students. '

According to Susan McCol-
Ioch, associate director of finan-
cial aid at Pitt, college tuition
rates are increasing from six to
nine percent each year. The
government report suggests that,
these increases may be forcing a
highei percentage of students to
depend on loans.

For instance, according to the
report, in Pennsylvania, commu-

nity college and proprietary
school participation in student
loans has grown, significantly
faster than the four-year colleges.
Hansen said in the report that
”there has been a large increase
in borrowing among students at
schools offering two years of
study or Iess” all across the
country. ~

Perhaps the most glaring
problem, according to the report,
is the lack of information on stu-
dent Ioans, the borrowers and

- how the federal government is af-

fected.

Further investigations are in
progress to determine what the
situation is and what is to be
done. At thispoint though/’there
is virtually no systematic analysis
that addresses directly the ques-

tion of how student loans do or y
. will affect the economy.”

For the past several years, Phil
Moyer has spent Easter weekend
at_ home with his family.

Steve Zucker, meanwhile, has

made-it a habit to return home

annually, at his parents request, A

to celebrate Passover. .
Things may change this spring.
Moyer, the Student Govern-

ment Board President, and Zuck-

er, a member of Pi Kappa Alpha

9 fraternity, face the same‘ problem

that the entire undergraduate stu-
dent population at the Universi-
ty of Pittsburgh faces. The _fina|s
reading period and final exam
period conflict with Passover and
Easter Week. '

Passover begins April 14, the

first day of the two—day reading;

period, and extends eight days
through the final exam period. Fi_-
nal exams begin April I6 — Holy
Thursday — and are scheduled
for Good Friday, Holy Saturday,

then Monday, Tuesday, and...

Wednesday following Easter S.ur»_1’_-.l..'f.;f 1.;

obligation in the Catholic faith.
”Obviously, they weren't look-
ing at the calendar. They can't do

that,” claimed a surprised-

Zucker. .
‘Dean Irwin Schulman, of Pitt's
College of Arts and Sciences, said

students should approach the in- 

structor if a final exam conflicts
with a religious commitment. .
.-”We don't have a rule that

deals with that,” Schulman said, ' ‘I

’’but instructors are expected —
as a matter of fact, the president
[Dr. Wesley Posvar] sends ‘out a

letter concerning this every year I -

— to react sympathetically if-a

student cannot attend .a class, get '1 

some work done or take a test be-'

Reagan tells Congress Israel behind arms deal

WASHINGTON —- Congres-
sional sources said Sunday that
Reagan administration officials
have told the Senate Intelligence
Committee that former Israeli
prime minister Shimon Peres and
several other Israeli officials con-
ceived of the idea to sell U.S.
arms to Iran and also to divert
profits from the sales to the
Contras.

- Sources also said the commit-
tee’s unpublished report indicates
that Israel repeatedly encouraged
President Reagan not to abandon
the sales to Iran, and that the Is-
raeli’s themselves shipped arms
to the Contra rebels fighting the
pro-Soviet government of Nicara-
guan president Daniel Ortega.

Other sources have already in— I

dicated that Israel has supplied
guns and ammunition to the Con-
tras since 1983, and those ship-
ments included Soviet-made

equipment captured from the:

Palestine Liberation Organization
during Israel's invasion of Leba-
non during 1982.

Israel, however, denies all
claims of shipping any weapons
to the Contras.

Iran claims gains in
gulf war with Iraq

NICOSIA, Cyprus —- Iran's offi-
cial news agency said Sunday
that its forces pushed deeper into
southern Iraq after an amphibious
landing and two fierce battles.

Iran's Islamic Republic News
Agency said also that 80 Iranian
children were killed Sunday
when an Iraqi missile hit a
school.

According to IRN, Iranian
forces made the gains over the
weekend and also repelled two
Iraqi counterattacks aimed at dis-
lodging the Iranian invaders.

Iraq meanwhile said Sunday
that Iranians did ”take important
positions,” but claimed Iraqi
forces were ”tightening the
noose” around the Iranian in—
vaders.

No independent verification of
either country's reports of the war
has been available, because both
countries have not allowed
reporters in to observe the
fighting.

13 dead as storm

CHICAGO — A fierce winter
storm rolled through the nation's
midsection over the weekend,
dumping a foot of snow on some
states, killing 13 people and
threatening to give many north-
eastern states their first major
snowfall of the winter.

The storm left many residents
of Illinois, Indiana and Michigan
digging out from a foot of snow,
and caused four traffic deaths in
Missouri, three each in Illinois
and Michigan and one in Indiana.

At Chicago's O’Hare-Interna-
tional Airport, the world's busiest,
many flights were delayed by as
much as an hour, and some
flights were cancelled entirely.
Also, many of the flights from St.
Louis’ Lambert International Air-

port were forced to be cancelled I

because of snow on the runways.
TWA reported ‘nearly 200 flights
cancelled.

at British checkpoint

BELFAST, Northern Ireland -
Police said the Irish Republican
Army launched a mortar attack
on a British security checkpoint
along the Irish border Sunday, in-
juring two policemen and a sol-

highway.

Police said six mortar shells fell
on the police-army checkpoint

lin, the capital cities of both Irish
countries.

According to police, three
shells missed their intended tar-
gets, while three others failed to
explode.

Stores

closer to

campus
aresafer

By Frances Sansig
Staff Writer

The recent wave of con-
venience store robberies in Pitts-
burgh seems to have, for the most
part, bypassed the immediate
Oakland area. While clerks re-
main on the alert, they are gener-
ally not overly concerned about
being held up, according to con-
venience store employees.

An assistant manager at 7-11,

_ who declined to give his name

for_fear his company wouldnot
be pleased, said he has not been
particularly bothered by the
chain of robberies.

”Sure, you worry about some-
thing like that,” he said. ”Around
the holidays, especially, people
hit stores. Convenience stores are
an easy spot to hit. _

”Of course, we have a whole
program on robbery prevention,
including a film. It's part of our
training. I don't think our store
has much to worry about. We
have the Pitt guards around here,
‘a luxury a lot of other stores don't
have/’ ‘

Peggy Ann «Fluhr, assistant
manager of Sheetz, at the corner
of Oakland and Forbes avenues,
said she also feels an extra sense
of-securitybecauseSheetz is lo-
cated near the Pitt campus.

Quick Mart on Fifth Avenue was buglarized Dec. 27.

’’I’m not worried about it at

all,” Fluhr said. ”At night, there
are Pitt campus police passing by
all the time. They come in fre-
quently. And the clerks at night
— you could say they're profes-
sional thief catchers. You can tell
if someone wants to rob you.
They watch you constantly.’’
' Fluhr, who often works at
night, said that as far as she
knows, Sheetz has not been
robbed in the seven months that
she has been working there.

Cindy Wooldridge,. assistant
manager at Co-Go's on Forbes
Avenue and a former Pitt student,
said, ’’I don't feel threatened.
There is a constant turnover of
people coming in and out of
here. The more people coming in
and out of a store, the more a rob-
ber will think twice about hitting

‘ the place.”

Wooldridge works

‘the 2 p.m. to midnight shift.

According the the assistant
manager of 7-11, convenience
stores are an easy target because
”they’re open all the time, and

they're easy to watch from the

However, he said that nine
times out of 10, if you don't have
any money in your drawer,
they'll walk out.

”During our training period,
we're told to just give them [rob-

' bers] the money,” she said. ”And

if someone is holding you -up,
what do you do? You give them
the money.” '

Fluhr said it is their policy not "

to accept $50 bills, except when
someone purchases around $40
worth of items, which happens

most often in the case of lottery

tickets.

One convenience store that has
not been so fortunate is the Quick
Mart on Fifth Avenue, which was
burglarized on Dec. 27. Quick
Mart, unlike the others, does not
operate 24 hours, but closes at 10
pm.

”They took cartons of
cigarettes, our expensive lighters

Porter named director

of admissions and aid

By Jill Carell

Assistant News Editor

The University of Pittsburgh is
using a new means of recruiting-
students for next year's freshman
class. Video tapes are being sent
to students who live far from
campus. This new recruiting
device is the product of Pitt's new
director of admissions and finan-
cial aid.

Betsy A. Porter, Ph.D, has been

appointed the new director of ad-
missions and financial aid for the
University of Pittsburgh. She is
replacing Joseph A. Merante,
who accepted a similar position

at the University of Southern’

California.

Porter is the first woman at Pitt
to be appointed to this position.

’’I’d like to feel I was more
qualified than the others for this
position,” Porter said. ’’I had both
admissions and financial aid,
others had one or the other, not
both. ‘None had a Ph.D or was
senior associate director.”

Prior to her new position, Port-
er had been a senior associate
director of admissions and finan-
cial aid at Pitt. A graduate of
Taylor—Allderdice High School,
she earned her bachelor's degree
in elementary education at the
University of Charleston, her
master's. degree at Duquesne
University and her Ph.D in higher
education administration at Pitt in

1984.

Before coming to Pitt in 1978,
she was associate director of ad-
missions at Duquesne University.

’’I felt there was a greater '

challenge and ‘opportunity at
Pitt,” she said. v

Porter said she was satisfied
with the way Merante was run-
ning the program; however, she
said she thinks a few changes
need to be made. _

’’It is not a question of chang-
ing, but doing more and broaden-

ing the geographical scope of our

population,” said Porter. ’’If the

University of Pittsburgh wants to
continue to be a competitive'in-V
stitution, the recruitments will »
have to become more geographi-

cally diverse.” ,_
Porter does not ‘plan to change
the criteria for admittingylstudents.

”We want to continue to‘ bring

in a quality freshman class,” she
said.‘ '

Porter said Pitt? has had more
applications for freshman pro-
grams and has been more suc-
cessful with admissions than most

”We are creating new ideas to
tempt the market and to keep a
competitive edge,” she said. _. .

According to Porter, the criter-
ia for admitting students varies.
There is no set quota by which
the admissions committee evalu-

ates applicants. Decisions are‘.

based on a combination of
grades, SATS, class rank and the
high school one attended”.

A little too little
and too, too late

The NCAA passed a new rule barring college boosters from
any form of recruiting at its convention in San Diego last
Thur_sday. , I

The rule/prohibits boosters from all forms ofaidin the recruit-
ing process, including such simple communicationas writing
to or telephoning a prospective high school recruit.

A measure was also passed to reduce the maximum number
of scholarships infootball from 30 to 25 each year, while the
number of basketball scholarships has gone from 15 to 13. The
fullsquad limit of scholarship football players remainsat 95.
The rule goes into effect Aug. 1, 1988. -

» These two! actions by the NCAA seem like a step in the righ
dir_efction+'eroding‘ someof the ethical and ﬁnancial problems

John Enright, Sports Editor

iodévi-"  
[They are not.. ' I ' I '

Finals never come at a good time of the year. Any student

 who has ever taken a finalwill attest to this.

In the ‘current schedule, we see that finals have been sched-

V  uledaround the Easter holiday, with finals falling on Good Fri-

day. Students will find their holidays overshadowed by the

  _ To the non-Christian‘ portion of the university's population,
 this seeming oversight in scheduling may not seem like a huge
‘  -problem, but for the remainder, the Easter holiday will be a

 

grim one, filled with the pressure of studying. It would seem
that the administration could have been more considerate in

I its scheduling.

I don't think any issue has
stirred up more controversy
among Pitt's student body than
the replacement in The Pitt News
of the lovable Bloom County

comic strip with the biz_zare Zip-

py the Pinhead strip.

Most seem to miss Bloom
County and despise Zippy. For
example, in the last issue of
Skyscraper Engineer, pe_riod_i_cal-
Iiy‘ published by ‘studentsfrom the
engineering department, there
appeared a parody of a Zippy car-
toon that accused The Pitt News
staff of bringing us Zippy for their
own amusement while everyone
else could go you-know-where.

I'll be totally honest with you
about my viewpoint. I detest
those insipid Zippy strips. They
don't make me laugh. They don't

provide any humorous perspec-

tives on current political and so-
cial issues like Bloom Country

did. All Zippy does is make me-

wonder what the hell is the point.

When I started reading Zippy,
I thought it must be one of those
comic strips that demands in-
tellectual consideration, and a re-
evaluation of our society and
‘reality because the Pinhead looks

_ at his world in a different way 

" Wrong.

I gave the strips lots of thought."
So did my friends. So did their‘

friends.» None of us could make
substantial head nor tail of‘ what
Zippy’screator, Bill Griffith, was

I am writing in reference to Phil
Moyer’s recent proposal to raise
the student activities fee. I would
like to bring to the attention of my
fellow students paying this fee, a
student government practice
which I am quite sure almost all
are unaware of. This practice in-
volves the payment of salaries to
the president and board mem-
bers, as well as some of the com-
mittee chairpeople. These
salaries are $960/year for the
president and $840/year for the
others. If these students, in such
highly sought positions,»are real-

. . lyso intent on, sewing their peers, _

'/'l'0I.BER'l'

trying to do with~his strip.

I finally decided that Griffith's
strip did not put the world into a
different light; it put the world in
another universe. All the strip
seemed to prove to me was that
Griffith can, at times, have a very
demented imagination. I can ap-
preciate that sort of creativity, but
a comic strip that makes me

wince in bafflement just doesn't ._
. that strip because it's sincere in

beat Bloom County.

Of course, others may feel'

differently. One Pitt undergradu-
ate provided me with an eloquent
defense of why he appreciated
Zippy and his mad universe. He
argued that the strip shows how
we try to rearrange our world to
make sense of it, just like Zippy
does with his irrelevant, off-the-

‘wall remarks (a cop-that has just

picked up Zippy said, ”You'd*

_better ‘have a good story, fun-

boy!” To which Zippy replies,
”How’s this —_ Boy meets girl 
boy loses girl  frog gets gun 
boy meets CIA agent, girl wins
|ottery?!!”)

Yet the Zippy strip comes
across to others as being_more a
form of intellectual snobbery than
a different view of reality. They
feel that those Zippy fans who

I.E'I"I'ER$

why do they command such sal-
aries? While it is true that these
students put in many hours, so do
many“other students, for no pay

and little recognition. Ifthese stu-

dents are not so intent on serving
without compensation, we prob-
ably voted 'in error’ last election.’

While their university service is
— _commendable,'many others are _ ,
"deservin'g”o.f equal commen_da- "
 tion. I am sure thatjnotxalljegliect-.   i’ "

 

There’sno zip in Zippy

claim to understand and enjoy-

- S the Zippy cartoons only do so to

boast some sort of superior wis-
dom or insight that others may

lack. I feel Zippy should be re- .

moved from The Pitt News, be-
cause the strip definitely breeds
insincerity. Too many times have
I heard stories of someone being
snubbed off as being ”unsophisti-
cated and narrow-minded” sim:
ply for professing that they
preferred Bloom County to
Zippy- .

‘ I miss Opus, Bill the Cat and
the rest of ‘the Bloom County
gang. I always enjoyed reading

getting a point across. Bloom
County, in fact, probably does a

. more effective job of making us

re-evaluate our views on reality
and issues than Zippy does sim-

-ply because Bloom County's
-Berke Breathed has the guts to

present his opinions in his car-

toons, while Bill Griffith covers 

his feelings with the opaqueness
of Zippy’s irrelevant universe.
I hope The_Pitt News will rein-

. state Bloom County soon. Unfor-

tunately, Bloom County costs a
lot more than Zippy does to pub-

jlish, and The. Pitt Newsjcannot
* cancel their subscription. Perhaps

next fall, though, with a new Pitt
News budget, we’ll‘be frolicking
again in the tranquil meadows of
Bloom County with Breathed’s
woodland friends.

CSG B salaries— too high

ed students across the nation
receive compensation for their

service. The more than $10,000 .
allocated in salaries could be.

much better used by the groups
receiving allocations. Before the
activities fee is adjusted, maybe
some internal budget cuts should
be considered or maybe the fee
should be raised quite substan-
tially so that all of the present
volunteers in service to the
university and other students can
be competitively compensated.

THE PITT l\lEWS, Monday, January 12, 1987

It's not hard to make love longdistance

The new wave in the world of
pornography is what some call
_”audio sex.” You call a phone
number, give the operator your
credit card number, and a record-
ing of a woman in heat will
whisper sweet nothings in your
ear.

Last Friday, I was walking up

‘Atwood Street. I noticed that ev-

ery car along the way had these
hot pink cards tucked under the
windshield wiper. They were
about the size of a ca|_ling card
andwere lying with the written
part facing the inside of the car,
presumably because when a
driver, got into his car he would
see the card read it and, hopeful-
ly,’ utilize the‘ information he
read.

Here's what was printed on the
cards: ‘ '

Hello, my name is Monique.

I "love sex. Do you?
Call me anytime.
The cards also included the

Learning

Angie is 12.

’_’He used to stay in the
bedroom and watch TV,” she
said. ”We would go into the
bedroom, and he would look at
us. He would say, ’Who are you?’
We thought he was kidding —
just playing around. I would say,
’I'm Angie, your daughter.’ He
wouldn't know me.” »

Angie's fatheris only 47 years
old, yet he has been diagnosed as
having Alzheimer's disease. The
disease is usually associated with

, people much older than Angie's

father. But he now lives in a nurs-
ing home because the disease has
progressed to the point where his
wife and children can no longer
care for him at home.

"I thought it was my fault that '
he was forgetting me,” Angie
said. ’’I thought he didn't want to
be my father.”

Angie's mother had brought

4 her to see me. Angie is taking part

in a project called the Second
Generation Program. This is
sponsored by the'Alzheimer's
Disease and Related Disorders
Association, and its purpose is to
help the children and grandchil-
dren of Alzheimer's victims to

Have you, heard the latest? Be-
ing smart just doesn't pay off. Ac-
cording to Newsweek, The New
York Times, Vogue and numer-
ous other newspapers and maga-
zines, intelligencein females isa
handicap. .

If you are a female college
graduate, you decrease your
chances of finding a mate — the
ultimate male with whom you
will spend your life. The older
you get the smaller your chances
become for marital bliss.

If you're successful and over .

30, you have only a 15 percent
chance of finding a mate.

Hopefully, I still have time to
find a guy. I'm only 21. _I hope
that over the years I haven't ab-
sorbed too much knowledge. Ac-
cording to these reports, guys just
don't like smart women anymore.

The sad thing is that some peo-

-ple who read these reports take

it to rjne_an,the above. I knowpeo-3

 
 

number, so that anybody could
call and listen to some harlot
breath heavily.

At first I laughed. ”What next?”
I thought. But as I walked on, I
saw that indeed, every car had
these cards on the windshield.
Seeing literally hundreds of hot
pink calling cards all over south
Oakland really started me
thinking.

Many people don't realize it,
but there are some living in Oak-
land who are not students. There
are many families who live here
— families with young children.

Imagine this: a 12-year-old boy
is walking down Atwood Street
on his way home from school;
he, too, begins to notice the cards
that are on every car he passes;
his curiosity gets the best of him;
and he picks one up-and reads it.
His palms begin to sweat, and his

knees start to knock. His heart.

starts beating overtime. He
knows he shouldn't even con-

to cope

cope with the disease. -

One of the things that the pro-
gram does is to teach the chldren
not to be ashamed to reveal their
inner thoughts. Angie, at 12,
seems tormented by what she has

gone through.

Her mother had already told
me that when her husband —
previously a successful accoun-
tant — had been living at home
with the disease, the family had
had‘ to clean him, bathe him, di-
aper him and feed him.

’’I didn't want to feed him,”
Angie said in a soft voice. ”He’s
my father — he should know
how to eat. I would have to wait
there with a spoon in his mouth,
until he swallowed the food. He
didn't know what to do with it
once it was in his mouth.

”I would be feeding him, and
I didn't want to do it anymore.
But my mother would say, ‘He's
your father, and he needs help.’
He was very slow chewinglthe
food.”

Angie is extremely jealous of-
her friends who have fathers who .

can take them to the park, or on

. trips or just sit around and talk to

them.

ple who'are truly worried now

- about their chances of finding a

husband.
But you meet all kinds. A cou-
ple of my so—called ”liberated

friends” said that they know a lot ‘

of females who came to college
for the. sole purpose of getting
married, and they have. no inten-
tions of working when they
graduate. I bet they'll be disap-
pointed when they find out that
they've wasted thousands of dol-
lars on an education when all
they've really doneis lessened
their chances of getting married.

What it gets down to is that our
times are not as liberated as we
may think. Come on, who's
career is put on hold to have
kids? Who is expected to just pick
up and leave when one’s spouse
gets a better job?

Take my sister, for example.
She went to college for four years

and is’_now a respiratory therapist. »
. Sh?‘-viS‘alsb,engaged. Her fiance

  

sider calling the number, but his
hormones tell him otherwise. He
finishes his walk home. Mom's

still at work, and the boy acci-

dently comes across his mother's
Visa. He calls the number and
listens in awe as the vixen on the
other end talks about things he
has never even thought about.
He's in heaven. The recording
ends, and he calls again. He

keeps calling, completely oblivi-
ous to the fact that each call is
costing his mother $6.

A month later, Mom gets her
Visa bill. She sees several
hundred dollars charged to Ma-
dame Monique’s Extraordinary

« Phone Sex Service (ficticious

name), and before anyone knows
it, Mom loses her good credit rat-
ing, and our favorite 12-year-old
gets grounded for the rest of his
life.

Am I making this point clearly?
What I'm saying is not that these
services shouldn't exist, but just
as potentially dangerous house-
hold chemicals and prescriptions
come in child-proof containers,
these phone sex services should
be kept out of the reach of
children. '

Not so much because kids will

listen to them and turn into rapists

when they grow up (they may not
end_up rapists, but I can think of
better things a 12-year-old should

be listening to), but to protect
their parents’ credit cards.
Putting advertisements on cars
in broad daylight should not hap-
pen. It shows extremely poor

taste as well as irresponsibility. .
It's one thing if parents bring V
these ads into their own homes. '

The pages of many adult publica-
tions are filled with them. If a par-
ent brings home a Penthouse and
one of his kids gets hold of it, it's
his fault if his kids call the
numbers. V

But when the source of the
phone numbers is something

completely beyond the parents"

control, something is wrong. One
role of parents is to screen what
their youngsters see and read.
They cannot do this if some sec-
tors of society put their calling
cards all over the neighborhood.
Whoever runs this business

should take a good look at the ’
way he/she advertises his/here

products and services.

"My friends would never see
my father,” Angie said. ’’I told
them that he took me to the mo-
vies every night. I told them that
we went away together on week-
ends, that we went on a holiday
to Walt Disney World. I didn't
tell. them the truth because I
didn't want them to know. I was
afraid that maybe they'd think
that I had*Alzheimer’s disease
too, and that they wouldn’t'talk
to me.”

works in the type ”of job where he
will be moved around .a lot. I
asked her what she would do if
he got transferred. Without hesi-
tation, she said that she would
have to go where he went. No
questions asked. It's assumed.
Now, I'm not saying whether
this is right or wrong, but it's just
the way things are. It gets frustrat-
ing. As young girls, we are taught
that females can do anything.
Over the years, the number of fe-
males in formerly male dominat-
ed fields has increased. We were
told that in the '80s the thing to
be is a career woman.
Realistically, a ‘marriage needs
two incomes these days. Also,
previous magazine and
newspaper articles had verified
that males liked and wanted’ fe-

I ‘males to be intelligent and career-

  

to the nursing home to visit her
father. He doesn't speak at all. He
smiles when they come into the
room, but he smiles when any-
one comes into the room.

"Sometimes I look forward to
visiting him,” Angie said. ’’I want
to see how he is, to see if any-
thing good has happened. Most
of the time,’though, I don't want
to go.

’’Sometimes when he's watch-
ing TV in the nursing home, he'll
just stare at us. I think that maybe
he is remembering when he was
well and we used be with him.”

At home, Angie's mother has a
large box filled with photographs
of the family when the father was
well. ”| go through the__box,” An-
gie said. ’’I look at all the pictures.
I ask myself why he had to get
this thing when I was growing
up?”   ,

"When I was little he used to
hold me up to the camera. My

‘ mother says that is because he

was proud of my light hair. I look
at those pictures for a long time.”

Angie is filled with terrible
thoughts. ”Sometimes ..." she
said. She started over. ”Some-V

oriented. This just goes to show
how things can be misleading.
I decided to talk to some of my
male friends about the subject.
These, by the-way, are men who
think of themselves as being very
open-minded. All three are in-
volved in a serious relationship.
They chose the best age to get
married as 25. They all said they
would" like their wife to work.
They all also wanted a family,
and they’all said that they would
expect their wife to stay home
with the kids for the first few
years. a

said. ”So I could stop seeing him.

It would be for both of us.”
She cried as she said those

words, and her mother began to g V

cry too, and soon the mother was
"rubbing the daughter's back. -
’’If I could make him under-

She said that when her father

THE PITT ‘NEWS, Monday, January 12, I987

Cuts in aid won't pass Congress Finals——

By Dirk Kaufman
Managing Editor

While President Reagan's
budget proposal has called for ex-
tensive cuts in education spend-
ing, there is little concern on the
part of the financial aid depart-
ment here.

”lt’s a long way from the
present proposal to actual legis-
lation," said Susan McColloch,
associate director of financial aid.
’’I don't think with the way things
are in the Senate and the House
that these proposals will go
through.”

Reagan has proposed that’

money slated for Pell Grants be
cut almost in half (from the cur-
rent $3.8 billion) in the next two
years. ,

McColloch said that last year
there were about 6,000 students
at Pitt who used the Pell Grant
program as part of their financial

aid.

‘'1 think it would pose a
tremendous problem for stu-
dents,” she said. ”But more so at
the high-cost private institutions
than at a public university like
Pitt."

Reagan's cuts come amid
reports that current students may
be forming a ”debtor genera-
tion.” There is anincreased de-
pendency on federal loans.
While use of Pell Grants has
fallen from 31.5 percent in 1980
to 17 percent this past year, use
of Guaranteed Student Loans has
increased four percent in the
same period.

The 21st annual survey of col-
lege students by UCLA and the
American Council on Education
found that more students are go-
ing into debt and fewer are get-
ting grants for college.

The increased dependency on
loans and the increase of tuition

may be changing the career
choices of young college
students.

According to the survey, over
a quarter of current students are
majoring in business.

A record 73 percent of students
-listed ”being very well-off finan-
cially” as a top goal, as compared
to 39 percent in 1980.

New lows for student interest
were found in:

”Helping others in difficulty,”
59 percent and ”promoting racial
understanding,” 27 percent.

Concern for the environment
and community action programs
also reached new lows in this sur-
vey with 16 and 19 percent,
respectively.

Interest in engineering, being a‘
doctor, dentist, or veterinarian,
and a career in nursing have all
been falling for at least the past
three years.

Baker still hasn't found peace

By Peg McEntee
Associated Press Writer_

SALT LAKE CITY — Nicole
Baker remembers one of. the
nights Gary Gilmore stole into
her dreams. She called him a
fool, this murderous lover she
once tried to join in death. He
vanished without a word.

In the 1.0 years since Gilmore
was executed, the woman he

’ loved has found God.

.She has not found peace.
”The things I went through are

I still in me,” Baker said. ”I still feel

them sometimes, like on a cold
winter morning I look out the
window and I get that same lone-

ly feeling I felt when I  knew I
wasn't going to see Gary
anymore.”

Not that she hasn't tried to for-
get. Three years ago she built a

speaking only on condition her
whereabouts and married name

In the spring of 1976, Baker
was a thrice-married 19-year-old
with two children when she met
Gilmore, 35. He was a recent
parolee who had spent most of

This adult life in prison.

It was a revelation finding a
mystic and sufferer like herself
who believed in reincarnation. ”I
felt like I had always loved him.”

Baker, now 30, has separated

er whose Christian beliefs she
embraced.

Baker worries that she hasn't

tened to destroy him, Baker said.
”We both knew that. It took so
little time to understand that in
each other. And it was like just
knowing each other and loving
each other healed them all.”

But if their love was a soothing
balm, it did not make a model
citizen of. Gilmore. An adept
thief, he began lifting cartons of
cigarettes for Baker and beer for
himself, drank heavily and picked
fights. '

Christopher Booth, a senior
from Philadelphia, has not
returned home for the Easter holi-
days during his first three years at
Pitt but was still upset by the sit-
uation. .\

’’I am very surprised,” he said.
’’I think it is very inconsiderate of
the university to do that."

lnterfraternity Council Presi-
dentlim Sluck added, ”It doesn't
offend me, but someone who is
into religion deeply might be
offended and upset.”

Rabbi Joe Levine of the univer-
sity’s Chaplains Association said
he and his associates have dis-
cussed this type of situation with
the university administration
before.

”While they are sympathetic,
they feel they are in a position
where their hands are tied,” he
said. A

our two registers [totalling about
$400] and took money from the
back of the store," said Dr. I.R.
Davare, assistant manager of
Quick Mart.

Since the Dec. 27 burglary,
owner Rajiv Verma said he has
added more locks and that he
and his employees are taking ex-
tra precautions when conducting
day-to-day business.

”We can only hope that we are
not robbed again, but I'm almost
sure we will be,” Verma said.
’’It’s part of the business.” _

Fluhr said that she believes

there is a major difference be-_

tween convenience stores locat-
ed near the Pitt campus and other
stores which have been robbed.

’’I don't think the ones near Pitt
are easy targets,” Fluhr said.
”People are always in the store.
Other stores are away from the
road and have parking lots. Be-
cause of their distance andithe
fact there are less people passing
by is probably why they’re.get-
ting robbed.” -

Gilmore became enraged one
day, and slapped her in his fury.
"That was it. Baker moved out.
”He knew I was going to
leave,” she said. ”And I knew
that if I left he was going to go kill
somebody  and that somebody
might be me."

After a frantic week of search-
ing for Baker, Gilmore robbed a
service station, ordering attendant
_Max Jensen to the restroom floor
before shooting him twice in the

On Nov. 16, 1976, prison
guards found Gilmore uncons-

to a hospital and revived. Baker,
comatose on her apartment

Public supports death penalty

By Lawrence Kilman
Associated Press Writer

NEW YORK — Ten years after
Gary Gilmore was executed by a
firing squad, the vast majority of
Americans continue to support
the death penalty, and many
want it used for crimes other than
murder, according to a Media
General-Associated Press poll.‘

Eighty-six percent of Americans
support the death -penalty —
about the same percentage who
supported it when a similar Me-
dia General—AP poll was conduct-
ed two years ago.

Fifty-six percent of people think
the death penalty should be used
only in certain cases, such as
murders of children, police
officers or multiple murders.
Only 30 percent of the 1,251
adults surveyed nationwide
thought the death penalty should
be used in all murder cases”

  

   
  
  
  
   
  
 
   
    
   

 

Eleven percent said there
should be no death penalty at all,
and three percent weren't sure.

When asked if the death
penalty was appropriate for
crimes other than murder, 47 per-

cent said yes. Slightly more than

half of them said it should be im-
posed in rape cases, about one-
third cited child molestation or
abuse, 20 percent said treason

and_14 percent said drug dealing. _

Forty-seven percent did not
think the death penalty should be
imposed for crimes. other than
murder-, and the rest were unsure.

Support for the death penalty is
overwhelming even though half
the respondents thought it was

‘wielded unfairly from case to

case according to the poll. Even
among those who believe it is in-
equitable, 83 percent support it.

Although executions no longer
generate the kind of publicity that
accompanied Gilmore’s execu-
tion Jan. 17, 1977, most Ameri-
cans do not consider executions
routine. Two—thirds of the respon-
dents said they continued to pay
as much attention to executions
as they had in the past.

Gilmore was the first person
executed after the U.S. Supreme
Court reinstituted the death
penalty in 1976.

Support for the death penalty
crossed all religious, education-
al, economic and regional differ-
ences. However, blacks and

whites had significantly different ‘

attitudes.

Twenty percent of blacks sup-
ported executions in all murder
cases, compared with 30 percent
of whites. One-third of blacks

-said there should be no death

penalty compared with nine per-
cent of whites.

The opinions were obtained in
a random, scientific sampling of
1,251 adults across the country
Nov. 7-14. As with all sample sur-
veys, the results of Media
General-AP telephone. polls can
vary‘ from the opinions of all
Americans because’ of chance
variation in the sample.

For a poll based on about
1,200 interviews, the results are
subject to an error margin of three
percentage points either way be-
cause of chance variations in the
sample. \. ‘

Broncos win23-20, headed for Pasadena

By Barry Wilner
AP Sports Writer

CLEVELAND — John Elway did
it his way Sunday, sending the
Denver Broncos into their second
Super Bowl.

Denver's offense‘ had struggled

all day under the pressure of the
Cleveland Browns’ ”Dawg”
defense, until Elway took over
and guided the Broncos to the

AFC title with a 23-20 overtime
victory.

Elway directed the Broncos on
a 98-yard drive to tie the score
20-20 on a 5-yard TD pass to
Mark Jackson with 37 seconds
left in regulation. He then moved
Denver 60 yards to win on Rich
Karlis’ 33-yard field goal, 5:48
into overtime. .

’’It seems like when we really
have our backs up to the wall,

like it was on the 2-yardline, we
fight back and play better,” Elway
said. ’’I was able to get the ball

-to them [his receivers], and they

were able to catch it.” .

On the 98-yard drive, Elway hit
six of nine passes for 78 yards
and ran twice for 20 more yards.
He also was sacked once, losing
eight yards.

He connected on passes of 22
yards to tight end Orson Mobley

and 28 to Steve Watson on a
third-and-12 in the overtime drive
after Denver forced a Cleveland
punt. Elway showed no signs of
being hampered by an injured
ankle he sustained in a 22-17 vic-
tory over New England last
weekend. _ » ‘ ,
Elway finished with 22 comple-
tions in 38 attempts for_ 244
yards. His late-game magic car-

Pitt loses

‘By Christopher Sepesy

Assistant Sports Editor

’’I think we were too gentle
with them, especially during
the first half. They played well,
and, unfortunately, wefound
out they played hard.”

Thus were the sentiments of
Pitt head coach Paul Evans af-
ter he and his Panthers
suffered a debilitating loss
Saturday to" the Georgetown
Hoyas, with a final score of
82-70. ’

’’They played well, better
than I really had expected,”
said Evans. ”But some of the
play of our team surprised me
as well. [Jerome] Lane played
as well as he has all season,
then he turns around and

makes some defensive lapses ‘

that cost us.”
Evans said he feels the Pitt
defense allowed several inside
. baskets by Georgetown, some-
thing that should not be done
if a team is trying to get ahead
and stay as such. This is espe-
cially evident by the fact that
Georgetown guard Jaren Jack-
son made 13 of his total 19
points in the second half.

When the game started, the
Panther team looked shaky,

V and by the. half,‘ only con-
tained the Hoyas by two

- points. Judging from the
games already played this sea-
son, this is nothing unusual for
the Pitt team, but they were
not able to-command the rest
of the game as they have been
able to with previous teams.
Evans commented that this
may have been because of the
lack of depth the Panther team
has and the abundance of
which the Hoyas seem to
have.

”He [Thompson] used play-
ers we really were not too sure
about,” said Evans. ”One of
these players was Jackson. We
really weren't sure of just how
‘he played, but wefound out.
And with our players, at times
we had to switch to an offense
we really didn't want to use.”-

ers, but nine players nonethe-
less,” said Thompson. ”Me, I
use players, and that takes a lot
of courage. I think if a player
is good enough to‘make'it to
the team, he should play, and
that is what I try to do.”~

”One thing is for sure,
though. The Pitt team will be

ers as Pitt's Charles Smith, De-
metreus ‘Gore, Jerome Lane
and especially Curtis Aiken.
According to both he and
Evans, his plan worked.

”We purposely tried to con-
trol the tempo of the game at
half court, and if we saw a
break we took it,” said
Thompson. ”Luckily, things
went our way.”

”They could afford to play
the way they did today, espe-
cially with all of their fouls,”
said Evans. ”And in the end,
it did tire us out a little.” _

Pitt missed seven of a tota_l -

EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. —
The New York Giants, adding the
momentum of a 35 mph wind to
the momentum built during the
last half of the season, shut down
the Washington Redskins _17-0
Sunday and advanced to their
first Super Bowl.

With Phil Simms running a

a defense that never let the Red-
skins inside the New York 23, the
Giants won their 11.th straight

They ran their record to 16-2 as
they continued on a mission
aimed at ending 30 years of frus-

F-loyas’ depth exposes a Panther weakness

By Pete Brasko Ill
Staff Writer

Depth — it's something every
coach wants to have. Depth is the
ability to bring fresh troops in and
out of the game and still get qual-
ity performances.

It's something the Georgetown
Hoyas seem to have in abun-
dance, and something the Pitt

Panthers do not seem to have.

In Saturday's 82-70 loss to the
Hoyas, the Panthers got four
points from their bench on two
long jumpers by freshman guard
Rod Brookin. Georgetown had
34 points — Jaren Jackson with
19, Ronnie Highsmith with 11
and Charles Smith (not to be con-
fused with Pitt's Charles Smith)
with four.

But perhaps more importantly,
the reserves’ performances meant

chunk of playing time. Ten differ-
ent Georgetown players spread
22 fouls around, many coming in
the process of banging Smith,
Lane and Gore in the paint.

The Hoyas simply wore the
Panthers down and took control
down the stretch.

After the game Georgetown
coach John Thompson said, ”This
Pitt team will be like a wounded
bear. That's a good ballclub.
They have no reason to be
down.” '

One hopes it is a wounded
bear, and not a tired, wounded
bear which Thompson might
have meant.

wise was near perfection, scoring
31 points and scarfing nine re-
bounds, was stripped of the ball
twice after this by both Smith and
Lane, but each time the Panthers
could not convert their good
defensive plays into point scoring
actions. Smith missed a jumper

and Lane let the ball hit his leg-

and roll off into the stands.

This was the last glimpse of a
comeback the» Panthers were to
see, as the Hoya team continued
for 19 points while the Panthers
only for 15, thus insuring a Hoya
victory.

One factor that seemed to in-

cur Evans’ wrath, and one play in-

particular, was the performances
of the officials.

5 ”What I call a double-dribble
is when-a player dribbles a ball,
then puts both hands on it, and
then begins dribbling again. The
official had to run all-the way
over from the other end of the
floor to make the call.’’

The Hoyas are now 11-1 over-
all, 2-1 in the Big East, while the
Panthers are 10-1, 1-1. For both

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, January l2, l987

arshall Clark/The Pitt News

Jerome Lane doesn't like to play power forward, but he sure rebounds like one.

 

Opus One, Pennsylvania's oldest
and most knowledgeable audio-
video store, has opened a branch

needs of students and other dis-
criminating musicilovers. This store
is conveniently located right in the
heart of Oakland, 3709 Forbes
Avenue, 2nd floor, right across from
McDonald's. '

The two major strengths that ele-
.vate Opus One above other audio-
video stores are knowledge and
time. '

Their extensive knowledge in
both audio and video was not
brought tothem by the tooth fairy
it was earned through 28 years of
‘ Jiard work. Tasso Spanos, the
founder of Opus One, together with

systems, repaired more compo-
nents, and recorded more live con-
certs than all of the Pittsburgh audio
stores, past and present, added up
together! Thousands of practical ex-
periences have taught them what is
important for good sound and what
is not. Components with flashy
lights, pretty colors, and many con-
trols are not as important to them
as those with natural sound or clear
pictures. - _
An extraordinary amount of time
is spent by Opus One to find the
best components. People always
ask them ”what’s new?” The impor-
tant question should be ”what’s
new that's good?” Their staff spends
a thousand hours a’ year wading
through the tide of‘new_ compo-
nents to find the few that are wor-

Opus One has continually pi-
oneered those components, which
almost inevitably become classics
that people proudly listen to for a
decade or more.

An extraordinary amount of time

is also spent on the customer. The.

staff of OpusrOne can answer your
questions, give you impressive

demonstrations, recommend com- ~

ponents and their proper installa-
tion and inform you about the few
important trends. Don't be sur-
prised that you may want to stay
more than an hour on your initial
visit to Opus One. You won't be the
first!

The extensive research of Opus
One will also save you time be-
cause you will not be confused by

several competing products at the
. same price. The_experts of Opus

One have already weeded out the

. bad, the mediocre and even the

very good, to bring you only the

, best components in your price

range.

We have found out that absolute-
ly nothing you own "can give you
as much enjoyment over the years
as a fine entertainment system.
With complete packages starting at
$499, we areprepared to back up

from Opus One, you get the best
sound for the money. -

Opus One also has a fully
equipped service center that can
handle anything from a broken
boom ‘box to a fine preamp. Their
phone-number is 323-0445.

And for you fraternity brothers...
we also have a commercial depart-
mentthat is well equipped to han-
dle the special requirements of
sound & video reinforcement in the
sometimes abusive environment of
the fraternity house.

Tasso Spanos began Opus One in
1959 because he had a great love
of music and he wanted to help
others who love music. When you
want to recreate the beauty and ex-
citement of a live musical perfor-
mance in your home, Opus One is
the place to begin.

Throughout the year, this location
will also be sponsoring a series of
special events and ads directed at
students, designed to inform and

. also to entertain. One in particular

will be a seminar given by Dave
Belles, one of America's premier

electronics designers, about preamp ’

and power‘ amp design andwhy
some are better sounding than
others. ' '

Jerome Lane never asked to be
placed in this situation. And he
never wanted to be.

But he is.

The 6-6 sophomore knows
there is no escape from his plight
— playing power forward on the
depth—plagued Pitt basketball
team. -

You see, Lanefs skills are more
oriented toward playing out one
the wing at small forward where
he can display his extraordinary
court vision and passing skills.

For now, though, he has to be
content hitting the boards and
collecting baskets off of missed
shots. And that's exactly what Pitt
coach Paul Evans wants him to
do since the scoring chores are in
the hands of Charles Smith, De-
metreus Gore and Curtis Aiken.

Lane is averaging an impressive
14.8 points per game. That num-
beris even more startling con-
sidering Lane’s primary role as a
garbage -man who puts in other
players missed shots.

  Lane doesn't like power forward, but...

Lane doesn't like that role, but
he has no other choice. ’’I hate
to play power forward, but I have
to for the team to win,” said Lane.
”And I want to win.”

The Panthers didn't win against

Georgetown at the Civic Arena
on Saturday afternoon, but Lane
once again dominated inside,
scoring 24 points and grabbing
12 rebounds.

Double figure rebounding is
becoming a trademark of Lane's
game. In 13 games this season,
Lane has had only one outing
[Wisconsin] where he hasn't had
10 ormore rebounds.

He is averaging 13.1 rebounds
per game. As of last Friday, l_ane
was second in Division I basket-
ball in rebounding -— and that has
even surpassed Lane's personal
goal. ”When the season started,
I wanted to be one of the top five

rebounders in the country,” said _

Lane.
best.” i .
Still, Lane would much rather
play the position for which he is
best suited — small forward. ‘'1

Bragging rights at stake tonight at Arena

By Tom Danyluk

Assistant Sports Editor

Back in the Arena, again.

For the second time in three
days, the Panther men's basket-
ball team travels downtown for a
shoot-out at the Civic Arena.

times, including last season's

Duquesne, 6-7 after Saturday's‘

new beginning. I didn't haveeto
wait until the next football season
to start all over again.”

While it might be a new begin-
ning, it was also a tiring begin-
ning. At football practice, punters
usually spend their time kicking
the ball for about half an hour
and then catching balls for field
goal kickers.

”I worked more in the first two
days than I did all football sea-
son,” Rasp joked. ”My legs were
really tired. It got me into shape,
although there is still — some
soreness.”

Being a freshman, Rasp had to
face a situation that not many
freshmen face. He entered an ath-

_ letic program that had’ two new

coaches, and although he had
heard good things about them
both, he had yet to see them
coach at Pitt.

’’In a way, it’s a good situation
for me,” Rasp explained. ”They
are both going toturn the pro-
grams around. It's on the
upswing.”

For .Osborn, a- junior"from
Wildwood Crest, N.J., playing
another sport is nothing unusual.
He was a member of the Pitt
baseball team last year and made
a big contribution.

is the Dukes’ top scorer, averag-
ing over 20 points per game.

Satalin also starts two fresh-
men, guard Tony Petrarca and
fon/vard Kevin McCarthy. The 6-2
Petrarca has been the team's most
pleasant surprise, averaging ten
points per contest. Fonivard Bri-
an Shanahan and 6-9 center Jim
Balog round out the starting
Hneup.

But as any player will outward-
ly agree, each game is significant.

Osborn began basketball prac-
tice after taking a week off follow-
ing the football season. He
dressed for the first time against
West Virginia after enduring
some rough practice sessions.

”Taking a week off was great
for my legs,’’ Osborn comment-
ed." My legs were sore after foot-
ball season, and my body was

banged up pretty bad. It took me -

at least a week of p_ractice to get
into basketball shape. It has been
two years since I have played, so
I have lost some time. I just have
to go out every day and try to
improve.”

One thing Osborn has working
to his advantage is that he is a
hustler. He doesn't like to sit
around idle and that's why play-
ing three sports is a plusfor him.

”I’m used to being active,” Os-
born said. ”I am not used to just
sitting and watching. I really en-
joy being part of the team. I love
practicing again.” __

All of these players have sur-
vived some grueling practices.
They have heard Coach Evans’
voice loud and clear when they
make mistakes but have also
heard him giving them support.’

’’If coach didn't yell at me, I'd
be worried,” Colombo said. ” If
he yells, that shows me he cares.

So don't expect the Panthers to
overlook the downtrodden
Dukes. ”We can't afford to have
a letdown against Duquesne,"
said forward Jerome Lane. ”We
just might need this win to get
into the [NCAA] Tournament."

After Pitt's disappointing loss to
the Hoyas, Duquesne can expect
an unpleasant rendezvous with a
snarling group of Panthers.

For Paul Evans just doesn't like
to lose.

He is a very tough coach. You do
things his way or no way. There
is no in—betvveen. He's very fair,
though.” »

The other players echo Colom-
bo’s feelings. » -

”When he shouts, you know to
get serious,” said Cavanaugh.
”He has a good relationship with
the players. He knows when to
be serious, but he also‘ knows
how to interact with us.”

Another adjustment these play-
ers had to make was getting used
to the physical rigors of college
basketball. The practices are tire-
some and long, and after not
playing ball for a year or so, their
bodies were in for quite a
surprise.

”At first I was really sore after
practice,” Luther admitted. ”I
could hardly move. It is a lot
more physical.”

But, determination and love for
the game has made these guys
forget about the aches and pains.

‘ They never quit.

”The life of.a walk-on is
tough,” commented Pitt graduate
assistant Duffy Burns. ' 4

Well, these are some tough

want to be out on the wing,” said
Lane. ”_I just wish we had more
personnel so I didn't have to play
power forward."

Lane isn't the only Panther
starter playing out of position.
Anyone who has seen Smith play
knows that he is a better player
at power forward facing the
basket, as opposed to posting up
at center. And Gore is an_ off-
guard, not a small forward. '

But Smith and Gore's new po-
sitions haven't seemed to
produce any noticeable effects on
their overall games. Meanwhile,

Lane's unnatural position has had '

obvious side effects — both good
and bad.
While he has shown great re-

bounding ability, Lane still has a _

tendency to drift on the court.
That was "quite apparent against
Georgetown. ”Lane played a
great game, but he missed some
defensive assignments that hurt
us,” said Evans.

Overall though, Lane's new
mental approach to the game has
been the main reason for his im-
proved play.

Last season Lane was accused
of being a crybaby. He was
moody on the court and would
occasionally do a disappearing
act on the floor.

This year that has happened
very few times. ”I'm coming out
to play this season,” said Lane.
”I’m not messing around on the

court'.'_”. '_ . j

Tyner’s departure adds insult to injury

By Matt O'Hara
Staff Writer

The Pitt Lady Panther basket-
ball team suffered its two biggest
losses of the season this past
weekend, adding to, their
troubles.

On Friday senior center Jenny
Tyner announced that she had
decided to quit the team.
Although Tyner was not a start-

er, she was the team's third lead-
ing scorer while playing just over
17 minutes per game.

Tyner began the season in All-
America fashion, scoring 42
points in the first two games. She
also turned in a team high
25-point performance in a one
point loss to Georgetown.

”She was pretty unhappy,”
said Lady Panther coach Kirk
Bruce. ”|’ve been working with

Normally, when someone
mentions Pitt and Cleveland State
around this time of year, one
tends to think of basketball.
However, other winter sports are
also in full swing, and one in par-
ticular is proving to be one of
Pitt's highlighted mainstays. ’

The Pitt Panther track team en-
gaged in a dual meet against

 

Cleveland State Saturday at the

Fitzgerald Field House and
emerged victorious.

Probably one of the most glar-
ing factors as to why Cleveland
State did so poorly is that they

. were severely undermanned —

and especially against so strong
a team as Pitt.

Often only having two compe-
titors in an event —— in a sport that
takes the top three finishers for
each team in scoring — this was
costly and, in combination with

Senior Pam Novosel, who has‘

Tabatha Long can both count on
seeing even more playing time.
”During hard times you learn
a lot about yourself, I guess this
was Jenny's way of dealing with
the problems we're going
through,” added Bruce. '

Meanwhile, on the basketball
court, the Lady Panthers were
embarrassed by Boston College
91-55 on Saturday afternoon. The
36 point margin of defeat .is
almost double the team's previ-
ous worst loss.

Jen Shingler and Sally Sheerer
each scored eight p ‘nts to lead
