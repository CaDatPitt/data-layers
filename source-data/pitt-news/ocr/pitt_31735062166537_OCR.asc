SG Elects T0 Abolish Vrana Election Is Invalid,
Student Uni“ B°""d Gularson Found In Closet

In “Volatile” Meeting

by BOB ALARSO
Last night Student Government (SG), by an over-
whelming margin, voted to abolish the Student Union Board
(SUB). The action was preceded by a heated floor debate
between the various factions. Words flew like bullets, fists
flew, and there were cries of “volatile situation.” The final

vote was two to one.

The basic issue dis-cussed was why in the world anyone would
want to abolish the SUB in the ﬁrst place. “Why in the world would
anyone want to abolish the SUB?” tasked Loren Nestle, cherubic

SG senator.

“Who said that?” roared Ken “Hizzoner” Frederick SG presi-
ident, “there are hundreds -of reasons why the SUB should be abol-
ished, and, if you don’t believe me, ask my Vice-president.”

“Yeah, there sure are,” Tom

 Meisner said, “there are hun-

dreds of reasons why the SUB
should .be abolished.”

“And the most important rea-
son is that they took the candy
machine out of the Lower
Lounge,” said Vic Willezm, SG
senator.

However, Frederick was pre-
pared with a long list of griev-
ances, and, between sobs, was
able to recite them to the meet-
ing. “Do you realize that the
SUB does not have a chair-
man? Why that just ruined Da-
vid and Lisa for me last week,
knowing that the ‘SUB doesn’t
have a chairman.”

“It certainly ruined the movie
for me too,” Meisner agreed. “I

agree with Ken.”

“And do you realize that you
couldn’t even get a candy bar?”
added Willem.

“Th second reason that We
don’t like the SUB is that they
switched rooms on us without
telling us,” -sniffed Fredericks. “I

remem=be~r t-he ﬁrst Saturday‘

night of the term when I left
that fraternity party with my
date to get something done over
at the office. Not only did I
have trouble ﬁnding our new

-location, but they took out the

couch!”

“Yeah, Ken and I can’t ﬁnd it
any more,” agreed Tommy.

“Maybe its behind the candy
m-achi-ne,” Willem guessed.

Hizzo-ner, weak from the emo-
tional strain, could hardly con-
tinue. “I can -hardly continue,”
said Fredericks, leaning out the
window to get some fresh air.
Almost at the point of collapse,
he was revived by a waft of per-
fumed air from direction of the
Cum Laude. “Someone just
threw up,” Fredricks said, as
he got back to his iharangue.

“These things I've mentioned
so far are just minor,” Fred-
rick understated, “compared to
my real reason for wanting to
abolish the SUB. Do you know
that someone on that body ac-
tually has an ancestor that was
sub human?” he said. I read it
right here in this book, Origin of
Species.

“He can read too,” said Tom-
my.

“Yeah,” said Willem, “but I
wish he could ﬁnd that darn
candy machine.

(See Editorial “Vrana for
President”—Page 4)

John Vrana, assistant to
the Dean of Student Affairs,
was informed today that his
election as Student Govern-
ment President, in Febru-
ary, 1964 has been declared
null and void by Dr. Edward F.
Crooke, Chief Justice of the
University Court of Appeals.

Crooke announced behind a
puff of smoke, “Well, you see,‘
it's like this. This boy Chuck
Gularson, who claims he was

GSA Ends Frivolty

by RICHARD K. CAN TELOUPE

In its never—ending search
to find new ways to do more
things for less money, the
General State Authority
(GSA) today announced sev-
eral changes it plans to make
at the University. The newly
appointed‘ General State
Trustees of the Common-
wealth System of Higher
Education have nodded their
approval.

First, in an attempt to elim-
nate the usual pomp and frivol-
ity of private institutions, one
member of the new trustees, I.
W. Fable, announced that the
Chancellor’s limousine would be
replaced by a more economical
mode of transport, namely, a
GSA inter-agency motor pool
car. “After all,” quipped Pitt’s
Fable, “the chauffeur wasn’t :a
union man anyhow.”

Newly appointed GSA Trus-
tee Robert D. Phlegming, who
in his spare time is Senate Ma-
jority Leader in Harrisburg, has
voiced considerable discontent
at what he termed “a downright
majority of student Democrats.”
In response, Phle-gmling has call-
ed for the submission to HUAC
of the names of all University
students known in any way to
conspire with what he called

“those vicious obstructionists.”
The GSA Trustees nodded their
approval, except for Governor
Raymond Shafer, also a trustee,
who was unavailable for com-
ment.

A drastic reduction in out-of-
state student scholarships has
been, called for by Governor.
Shafer who termed the out-of-
staters “leaches.” In place of
these scholarship payments, re-
cipient students will now be
forced to mow the copious ﬁelds

_,.of grass around the University.

This idea pleased the Board im-
mensely, because now the ‘world
famous Pitt Grounds Crew can
be freed for more strategic tasks
like trimming the hedges in
front of GSA headquarters in
Harrisburg. The GSA Trustee
nodded their approval.

The last innovation to be ini-
tiated around the University
will be a drastic overhaul of the
plans for Pitt’s new Hilltop Vil-
lage Dormitories to be located
nea-r Pitt Stadium. The Trustees
have decided that instead of the
usual bed style No. 877932 al-
loted to such dorms, burlap
‘hammocks will be strung from
hidden hooks. Since these ham-

mocks can be taken down dur- ‘

ing the day, I. W. Fable claimed,
“We get more people in less
space. It’s allvery simple,” Fable
averred. The Trustees nodded
their approval.

locked up in a linen closet on
the eighth floor of the Ruskin
Apartments. All Gularson could
remember was getting th-is call
from :3. little old lady and being
invited to tea in her apartment.
He stated he had been in a state
of general somnambulance ever
since. This all too-k place three
days before petitions were due
in the Student Government elec-
tion of 1964.”

Crooke said, “I’ve been in
some crooked elections .in my
time, but this one takes the cake,
or is it the cookie. Imagine us-
ing a harmless old lady to fix
an election for you.”

Crooke said, in rendering his
land mark decision, in a. court-
room crowded with the members
of. the Dean of Women's staff,
the University administrative
committee, elevator operators,
and Hunt Room waitresses.~
“Well it’s like this, folks. We’ll
have to have a new election:But
let’s face it. Around this place
we’ll have plenty of candidates.
There’s always that Risque kid
and running mate, Buster Hind-
Sight.”

In a press conference held at
the IP-itt Tavern after the ex-
haustive trial, Justice Crooke
blustered, “Vrana doesn’t have
a Li-tch-ﬁeld’s chance of being
allowed to run again. It’s back
to being editor of the Polaris
for him.”

Vrana was contacted in the
Student for Democratic Society
Booth in the Tuck Shop and
said, “Imagine being ﬁred by
my boss ﬁve minutes after that
old hack rendered the decision.
That Miss What's her name
would have at least given me
time to clean out my desk. I
have several offers already that
I’m considering: liaison between
Saga Food Service and the Oak-
land Original; washing windows

outside, and chairman of the
Social Science Division at __the
Air Force Academy. I’d like -to
stay in Oakland if I could.”

Members of the University
School of Law faculty served as
Vrana’s attorneys. This marked
the 37th consecutive case the
faculty has lost. Vrana admitted
his defense was an utter dis-
aster. “But I should have known
better than to put that faculy
up against a second year law
school student from Duquesne,”
he said.

Vrana was conﬁdent he would
ﬁnd some position in the Uni-
versity if he wanted to stay. “I
know a lot of administrations
will want a good guy like me,
despite momentary disgrace. I
understand the Student Union
would be a good place «to start
looking. T-here are new positions
created there every day.” Vrana
was seen leaving with a pack-
et of letters applying for ‘posi-
tions :as administrative assis-
tant. The addresses included
Farker Frances Pnwright, Flori-
da entrepreneur; Serving N.
Othmlan, instructor of English,
Oblivion College, Kansas; and
William B. -Raft, social director
of La Roche College.

Senate Defeats Affiliation Bill

That magnificent body,
the Student Government
Senate defeated an original
draft to affiliate with the
National Student Associa-
tion for Marxist Penetration
(NSAMP) .

King, “if they would have

to grow a moustache and a
beard and call myself Vladi-
mi-r." The bill was narrowly de-
feated by the Senate.

Senator Singer “Sewing Ma-
chine” Eppy said, “There i.s a
need to have Marxist. penetra-
tion on this campus. The time
for action has come. We must
impeach the King.”

In response to this furtive
plea, the King took out his blow
gun and calmly blew a dart at
Eppy. The dart hit an ashtray
spilling ashes into poor Eppy’s
lap.

Meanwhile, the friendly court
jester, rapped his gavel three
times and said to Eppy, “You

can take that any way you
want.” Eppy, that poo-r despon-
dent soul, walked out of the
meeting with tears in his shady
eyes.

Some Senators, at this time,
felt that the original bill was
too radical. “This is a body of
Senators as deﬁned in the SG
constitution,” said the corpulent
one, “Senators, reject this meas-
ure, reject it-—reject it—reject
it, for we are endangering our
very existence.”

One ardent spectator sitting
in the ﬁrst row of seats casually
walked over to the corpulent
one and stuck a. pin in his arm.

Editorial: Vrana For President

(The following is reprinted from The Pitt News editorial of Feb. 26, 1964.)

Politics is a funny business and, unfortunately, a little ridiculous at

. times. This certainly must be considered the case in today's election. We

are being asked to select a Student Government for next year yet the stu-
dents are being given very little chance to do any selecting.

John Vrana is running for president and Ron Cimino is running for
vice-president. John Vrana is the only person running for president and
the same is true in the vice-presidential category. Is this ridiculous?

Not really. John Vrana has all the qualifications necessary to be a
successful president once he gets into office.‘He is a good bit older than
most stu-dents here, having served in the air force for three years before
coming to the University. This gives him a more mature and broader out-
look on things. He is a sharp student, possessing well over a 3.50 Q.P.A.,
and knows his way around the administrative circles. He is the type of

' fellow who can get a job accomplished. Beling business manager of the Owl

requires such talents in excess. Perhaps his greatest asset, however, is the
fact that he has never served on S.G. and knows actually very little of the

 way in which the organization functions. Because of this he would not be

restricted by procedures of the past of which he knows nothing. When a
problem comes up he will not appdint a committee to investigate it as has
been done in the past. Instead he will point his finger at a senator and say;
“Take care of it!” And it had darn better well be taken care of, and plenty
fast too, or he’ll know the reason why. A

When a problem arises with the administration, he will not crawl
over to Dr. Rankin’s office and beg for a pliece of his time, but will barge
in and demand action. This is the type of leader that S.G. needs and for-
saking any calamity, John Vrana will be the next president of S.G.

The problem is that he is running on the Able Party. This party is
in business to win elections and not to furnish candidates who can do a
good job once elected. To the party, a good vote-getter is worth twenty
competent people.

We do not say that there are no people running on the Able Party
ticket who would not make good senators. However, for heaven sake, don’t
vote the straight Able ticket. It’s a sure way to smother the initiative of
the man who is elected president. ‘

University Bobulation

Injebulous Frapidity

by Plethora Derudite

EMERSICATING from the
ever endowlable fragipany
stool, this University cannot
possibly go» on its current
mode of fred. Just look at
the football team. Obviously,
the only plea of ensessment
are totalling moiling in their
own gravy.

For instance. We suspect
not only to merge, but also
in addition to the persp_1ca-
ceous juxtaposition of en] oy-
ments is the freedom for
creating our own grange. If

. the 4H Club can do it, isn’t

it true that a rubber bands?

j We expect as such. Why?

Only in that Pittsburgh's
true medicinal purpose was
pumpkin. Savina? _
In addition to exercising
this positively inpropoilious
query without solely critch-
ed upon other formulizations,
the administration insists
upon intangible crastiination
over and above the cries of,
“Long live Brian Bubnis.”

. This is folicle? We can only

answer this question.
THE PURPOSE of this col-
umn is not only to matricu-

_’ late certain irredescable ter-

minologies germane to the
irrelavancies of popularly

misc-oncepted falsiﬁcations.
After all, we are not here
not here to bobulate.
Why are we here?

But perhaps I ask too many
questions. Why not? We
must get to the bottom. This
university has been eradi-
cating trejibendous educa-
tion for longer than most of
us were ‘born. So what? A
spool has many threads.
Granted that we see almost
every single individual ex-
hibit. But let’s see some more
prompt delays. Muncie, Ind.

There is more to a pan-
ther cub than just a tennis
racket. No facet of the imag-
ination has ever been more
enunciated twfice already.
But we cannot except perfec-
tion in all means. That lies

_in the future only. If today
is grim, must yesterday in

its capacity of a measure-
ment of time be without true
enfranchisement? A close
scru-tiny of the situational
consequences proves beyond
an ucmbre of a dubitable ex-
pression. We can hold out
much longer. As the emmi-

AND IN conclusion. Our
understanding of the solu-
tion lies not in the problem.
Rather, we must ask our-
selves. The» answer is obvi-
ous. We are endangering our
right to liquidate archetypal
perfunctorially in view of
this. Such a modicum of in-
ter-relatinnal su'bsta.nr:e can-
not help but being irrevoca-
biy a Iact totum of indig.e.n=
ous but coercive pecuniar-
it.-,..._ ,.--:..¢:y.,,.

What does the administra-
tion plan to do about this
onflagration of apined queb-
lin? What does “kreplach”
mean? We must not fall into
this trap as well. We must
preservere if this, our great
exoneration, is to ﬂuctuate.
If no one malingers, woe to
he who heeds the jackals of
mistrenchen.

To arms! We must impreg-
nate the bastions of our fus-
ilage. Let no insouciant boj u-
late. Be parsimony in your
fanctlion.

The ‘general idiocy ﬂaunted on
this page consists of secretions
in the form of printer's ink from
the warped minds of the editor
and its staff.

Sometimes we let visiting
creeps perpetrate, something to
put here, but generally we like
to make our own mistakes. That
does not mean we would not
wel-come any such effusions from
our readers’ minds. If you have
a gripe or something you think
is important to say, type (is up;
clutch it in your clammy little

hand and ﬂy on up here with it.

We can’t guarantee to print
what you have to say, but we
can all have a good laugh out of
it. If you still dare to -creep on
up here, wait a week; we like
to use a ghost writer at this
time of year.

Oh, by the way; none of that
phony Dracula or Frankenstein
stuff. We have enough ghouls
up -here already.

As for letters to .the editor
. . . don’t bother. We write our
own; it's neater that way.

former University student. Mr.
Grim is a contemporary writer
 fairy tales who often colla-
borates with Bob Dylan.
Produced by Bobby Kennedy,
who won the Academy Award
last year for Best Producer for
his version of Maternity Ward,
and Familiar Trees of America
will boast an illustrious cast.

The featured role is played by»

Hobart Harris, a digniﬁed stal-
wart arboreologist whose task
in life i-s to inspect beautiful
trees. by close observation. The
female heroine is portrayed dra-
matically by Elizabeth‘ Taylor,
a lovely young sappling whom
you will remember from her

-Qirevious work in National Vel-

vet.
Dan Booker gives a convinc-
ing performance as the villain

who organizes sapling's discard-'

ed by Harris into a protest
march on Dunsinane Hill sur-
round the Cathedral of Fores-
try. Paul Stoller, king of For-
estry and arch enemy to both
Harris and Booker, sits in ob-
livion on the 92nd floor to pre-
pare his,.stra,teg'y.

What occurs is a battle Where

the only way to discern the
characters is by the colors they
wear. Harris is alwayes in white

and Booker is always in black.
Stoller can only be seen hanging
from windows periodically to
check the progress of the march
for the Pitt News.

» Several of the trees have. note-
worthy characterizations. The
marijuana tree, played by Tim-
othy Leary, tries to establish a
new breed that will be -able to

' produce tobacco as well as kicks.

The black cherry tree, world
renowned for its unmistakable
ﬂavor in wine, is portrayed by
Ken Frederick. He strips the

‘needles from tender young

shoots, boils them in syrup, and
eats them as a confection in his
offices in the Student Union.
From his sap collection (consist-
ing of Student Government sen-
ators) Frederick makes potent

‘cough medicine from an ancient

secret recipe.

The conﬂict is ﬁnally resolved
to everyone’s detriment, while
Harris escapes with Taylor,
much to his enjoyment. Don’-t
miss this unbelievable thriller,
now showing at Mellon Square
Parking Garage.

MALLOY THANKED

The secretaries. of the De-
partment of Political Science
wish to present a very special
award to James Malloy, in-'

-structor in political science, .

for switching from cigarettes

’ to cigars and not only pro-

longing his longevity to the
ecstasy of all, but also per-
petuating the memory of a
beloved one recently pas-sed

Chancellor Announces

50 Percent

Discount

On Book Center Sales

Chancellor Wesley W. Posvar,
yielding to the pressure by the
Student Government (SG) Book
Center Committee, has announc-
ed a 50 ‘per cent disco-unt in all
purchases in the University Book
Center and Your Camlpvus Store.

“The discount will be effective
*imzmecli»ately,” stated Dr. Posvar.

Dr. Posvar h-ad issued a state-
ment earlier this term allowing
a ten per cent discount on hard-

Dorm Date
Rate Rising

«Panic embraced the Women’s
dorms Saturday night. The head
‘residents were crazed with wo-r-
ry, for every University woman
was out on a date. Misgs.Sh»iboleth
of the Dean of Women’s staff,
commented, “After all the things
we have taught these girls, they
dare to go out on a Saturday
night!” The Dean of Men won-
dered rvwhat happened ‘to his
charges, because never before
lhad they exhibited such mas-
culinity.

What h-ad happened was in-
deed amazing. The men had
sl“.-aken off their usual letha:rgy
and, for once in their lives, they
decided to do something con-
structive. N-ot a co-mcpzlaint was
heard in the Towers about be-
ing able to ﬁnd a date. On-e sen-
ior comm-ented, “You know, the
girls here aren’t half as bad as
I thought.” Another said, “May-
be I'll do this again next week-
end.” A third snickered, “Don’t
bet on that.”

The men for the most part,‘
looked human for a change. One
mother who happened to be_

around did not even -recognize
her own son. The Women were
amazed.

A University psychology pro-
fessor analyzed the strange ac-
tions on the part of the men in
this way: “They have ﬁnally
realized that all dates are not
‘Love them and leave them af-
fairs.’ This is an unusually
healthy attitude to take. Maybe
this is the begiiming of a new
trend.”

 The reaction on the part of

the coeds was signiﬁcant. The
general comment was that “It’s
about time!” Many women
stated that the attitude the men
had taken previously was much
too lackadazical. “A good time,
13. cup of coffee—that’s not too
much to -ask!” one junior istatedl

What will next Weekend bring?
Probably a return to the old
order. The consensus, however,
seems to favor the unusual hap-
pening of last Saturday night,
which will always be remem-
bered as “The night the boys
turned into men.”

  Fr i58...lhe st lsapes in Pg. come from...

covered textbooks beginning in
January. However, the recent
steal-in sponsored by SG prompt-
ed him to have a change of
heart.

When asked to comment on
Dr. Posvar’s decision, Ken Fred-
ericks, president of SG, was sur-
prisingly displeased. “We stu-
dents can net far more by using
such tactics as a steal-in, to gain
what we want.

“In fact, I am now in the pro-
cess of organizing another Bo-_ok
Center Committee to protest the
-Chanc~ellor’~s decision and to gain
free privileges to -all we want
in the Book Center. We won’t
stop until we get everything
free of charge,” Frederick con-
cluded.

 “Lantern Night,” according to
_ nrny Hill, this year’s ‘Lantern
igihvt chairman, “is a grand old
-nivelrsity tradition by which
ireshman girls undergo a trans-
;ormatio»n to womanhood.”
;7AThis ye-ar, students met at
{tephen Foster Memorial where
j-hey were introduced 'to Father
Pitt and his common-in-law wife,
other Pitt, affectionately
S,"-nown as “Ma.” The girls were
henswept underground, via the
l\Iorth Pole, to the Cathedral
basement. They then climbed up
wo ﬂights of steps to the Com-
rnons Room while balancing ta
ighted candle on the end of a
‘tick.
If the young lady made it to
‘the Commons Room withou-t
first-degree burns,’ slhe partici-
pated in a stirring ceremony
during which she heard 12 Alum-
' igread speeches, listened to her
neighbor recite the Lantern
Night Pledge, and faked the Al-
ma Mater as hot wax dropped
on her foot. ,
. Some of the VIP’s present at
this thrilling event were the

Fire Marshall, and Smokey the
Bear.

Allowing‘ that the novice fresh-
man woman survives that initia-
tion with body and soul intact,
the 12th ﬂoor permits her to
continue her education at the
University. If not, to quote Miss
Hill, “S-he looses!” »

I According to Dr. Posvar, there
are” several other reasons for
this unusual undertaking. One
of them is that it "will provide a
-much needed change of scenery
fo the bleary-eye University stu-
dent. He feels that there-is too
much repetition in the school’s
architecture such as the Towers
and the women’s dorms. “Al-

though it can’t compare to
Frank Lloyd Wright’s Falling
Water,” said the Chancellor,
‘-‘I’m sure this future design of
the Cathedral will be a turning
point in present day architec-
ture.” .
Another reason for-the change
in the Cathedral’s position is
related to the Chancello-r’s phy-
sical ﬁtness program. The Chan-
cellor himself has been seen jog-

relying on the elevators, which
will no longer be needed after the
change, Buildings and Grounds
will convert them into six very
long corridors. The students will
then be able to trot the entire
length of the Catlhedral to reach
their classes. I '

Several students, who wish to
remain anonymous, but’ did ﬂash
their ID cards to make their
statements official, were asked
what their reactions were to this
change. All replied that they
are in favor of any change to

get to classes and the tradition-
al lateness will be avoided. Chan-
cellor Posvar is "reconsidering
his physical ﬁtness program af-
ter hearing these comments.
There are problems «involved
when the tall, stately, Cathedral

is put in a reclining *-position-

The Commons Room must be
rearranged; new B and G levels
must be constructed; all post-

cards, decals, and other articles

with the Cathedral’s likeness
must be remade; the overhead
lights .will no longer be over-
head; ceilings and ﬂoors will

become walls and walls will be- .

come ceilings and ﬂoors; more
windows will be exposed as tar-
gets for stone-throwers;

thin red lines and thinner red
lines tracking a pale-blue ox-
ford or green-edged yellow on
passion fruit red. Shirts have
plenty of trimming: parsley,
sage, and thyme.

Dresses: As Britain inﬂuences
the college girls’ shirts, so does
France her dresses. Watch for
French detailing like the Magi-
not line across collars and cuffs,
low tortoise-trimmed belts. And
shirtdresses pick up details
that are important On sweaters
and skirts. They are waterproof,
shock resistant, and anti-mag-
netic.

Accessories: Hardware shines

I everywhere

-—- on coats, shoes,
belts, handbags, around waists.
Look for screws, nuts, holds, and
old transmissions. Miss Bouvier
advises people with weak backs
to ‘stick with lumber jackets.

Collegiate fashion trendsetters

"will bring their kilts back to
campus this fall, along with
their bagpipes. They’ll take their
old ones out of the mothiballs
and sho-rten them to mid-thigh,
and they’ll buy new ones, mini-
length, of course, in so-lids and
plaids worn with opaque tights
in new darkling colors,‘and their
fathers will want to know what
was wrong with the old ones.

All Students Will Receive
A’s From Pleased Profs

by BERNARD, THE BENEVOLENT
All students should be happy to hear that they will re-
ceive an “A” from their professors in every course for the
term. The reasons for this generous reward are numerous;
the first is that 90% of the students made such easy work
of their mid—term exams. Most of the students received

‘5B’s” or better.

Another reason for the
the magnificent: attendance of
classes, particularly in large
lectures where roll is never tak-
en. The teachers are also hap-
py to make this announcement
because the students give their
=undivided -attention’ to lectures
and recitation classes, and be-
Cause they (the students) nev-
er, never enter lecture late, in-
terrupting the professor who

News Hawks during spring practice, fall ca.mp, and exhibi-
tion play, here’s what my scouting report indicates about
Sunday’s Toilet Bowl.

The Pitt News Hawks are a quick, highly—spirited team
that gives you a fight whenever they can. They play as if
the game were a tag team match. They specialize in knee
blocks and gang tackling. And with their -depth, they can
have a dozen players ejected without it affecting their game
plan.

THE HAWKS have experience up front. The spirit is
so high that the Hawks have nﬁicknamed their offensive
unit, the “Go” team; the defensive unit, the “Yellow” team;
and the unit that goes to class, the “Yiddush Bandits.”

On the other hand, the Owl Owls have only two re-
turning lettermen. Earl “The Pearl” Fischl figures to start
at quarterback, but “Pearl” has been known to fink out in
practice. If “The Pearl” shows, split end Tom “The Bomb"
Streever will yelp with glee.

“The Bomb” slincerely believes he’s Homer Jones and
he’s even imitated Homer's thought processes. “Just turn
me in the direction we’re going,” says “The Bomb,” “and
‘Pearl’ and I will score.”

BUT THE‘ OWLS use no particular offensive system

and their defensive alignment can best be described as cha-

otic.

The Hawks’ 12 -offensive sets and 22 defensive forma-
tions, plus the fact that none of them have dates for Sat-
urday night, should enable them to increase last year’s
6-0 win, say, 55-0.

“We will bury them.” With
this short phrase, Jay Rosen-
stein, captain of the fabled Pitt
News Hawks, summed up his
feelings about this Week’s open-
er with the Owl Owls. The game
will be played at 10 a.m. Sun-
day.

This year, the Owl presents
one of its motliest crews ever
from a staff that has a perpetual
disheveled look. In contrast, the
Hawks have their strongest team
ever and are conﬁdent of an-
other bowl bid. -

Besides “Flatbusl1,” one of the
speediest ends ever to come
down the pike, the Hawks have
four other returning lettermen.
In his mnpteenth year at quar-
terback will be George “Mousta-
chio” Lies, a brilliant pass
maker, who can also play a. lit-
tle football.

Joining “Flatbush” at end will
be Dan “Hands” Lichtenstein
who is almost -as fast as his
nickname indicates. At center [is
Roy “Ju.mp-Shot” Jacobs, who
was picked up on waivers from
WPGH.

Shoning up the defense is Mike
“Hawk” Brou-rman. “Hawk,”
who has been compared to Paul
Hornung for his -off-Ithe-ﬁeld de-
corum, is -shooting for lh.i-s «third
“Sam Huff Fair-Play Award.”
Shooting is the righ-t word, as
the “Hawk” is never seen with-
out hvi-s .45 caliber pistol.

Joning these veterans is a
fearsome collection of newcom-
ers. The offensive halfback posi-
tions will be manned by Dan
“The Baron” Booker and Hobie
“Warmonger” Harris.‘ ‘They may
be rookies, but they play like
girls,” said “Flatbush.”

TOM “ALABAMA” SACKS, shown here in his junior varsity days,

has announced that he is ﬂying in from [Boston to play for the
“Hawks” on Sunday. “Bama” is one of the smaller members of
the team.

The defensive rush will be
lead by Art “Posey” Rosengar-
ten and Dave “G.I.” Tiernan,
both of whom go 6'8’, 295, and
run the 100 in 9.5. “If they don't
pressure the quart-erback, they’l'l
smother him to death,” noted
“Flatbush” with the obvious
glee of a true sadi-st.

Joining the “Hawk” at line-
-backer is Paul “Wrong-Way”
Stoller, one of the few question-
marks on this powerhouse. The
big que.s-tion mark is whether

he can get out of bed and show <

up for the ga-me. ’

The safeties will be Jerry “Le-
roy” Gruebel and John “Physi-
que” Silesky. “Leroy” has look-
ed good in practice while, ac-
cording to all reports, “Physi-
que” has look real good in front
of a mirror.

“Elatbush” also announced that

Coup D’Etat

Sophs Editor Jay “Flatbush”
Roscnstein today denied rumors
that the editorial board is plan-
ning a coup d’etat to take over
the sports staff. According to
some reports, the editors are
planning to turn the sports of-
fice into a fudge factory.

“That would be too hard,”
Rosenstein commented. “They
could make almond chocolate
bars, using all the nuts they
have in the news room.”

But, I don’t think it’s true,
First, we have an intelligence
system second only to that of
the Egyptian army. Secondly,
we have our defenses ready.
Our army is about on a level

with the Italian Army, and who A

can beat that.”

“No, I don’t think there is a
D0SSibility of a coupe d’etat. We
are too strong. . . . Ah! . . Help!
. . . Help! . . Heee . . .”

It was hard to understand his
ﬁnal remarks, as the relentless
sports editor was being choked
by four men wearing ‘white
sheets and badges which carried
the ominous words “Beu1ah’s
Revenge.”

Cheerleaders

The biggest new money-maker
on the book market is the Kin-
sey-type report. Always out to
make a buck, the energetic sports
staff of the Pitt News has done
its own report, climaxing in a
soon-to-be-published release.

The sports staff, after exclu-
sive, intimate ge-t-togetlhers with
the female cheerleaders, will
come out with a report entitled
“Sex and the College Cheerlead-
er?”

The mo-st startling news of all
is the fact that all of the cheer-
leaders regularly and freely en-
gage in . . . ‘
