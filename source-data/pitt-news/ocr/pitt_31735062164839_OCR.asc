University To Remain

_ _By KAREN TOKAR ’ V

. “The _state will -not take us over because it's not good
policy; they realize that keeping Pitt private and generat-
ing private dollars is best for them" were the reassuring
words of Dr. Edgar B. Cale, vice-chancellor for development.

State Senate Passes

For Emergency Grant

By LINDA GOLDSTEIN

The state Senate passed
a bill giving the University
an _ emergency grant of
$1,250,000 to meet its‘ June
payroll by a vote of 47 to
one. The legislation was rati-

ﬁed after‘ the minimum of three
days _of required consideration. It .

was sent immediately to the

House of Representatives, where ,

is was assigned to Representative

' Martin P. Mul1en’s’House Appro-

priations Committee. _ .
Before the Appropriations Com-

' mittee acts on the measure, how-

ever, it must wait for the report
from the House subcommittee
that ‘met‘in Pittsburgh, Friday,

Dr. Cale affirmed that the University will become more state

related but not a state University in the “California system fashion.” '

“We are now state related, but we’ll get more (state) money backing

us,” he said. “We don’t have a
resolution to destroy our dynam-
ic goals . . . will preserve every-
thing.” j I

Tuitions, unrestricted endow-
‘ments, gifts and grants, and re-
search "overhead are the Univer-
Asity’s sources of free cash. This
free-"ﬂowing cash is constantly
ﬂuctuating; the state aid will

H serve to stabilize this, Dr. Cale

pointed out- .- -
_ The University is one of 1
schools ‘receiving state aid. This.

is a unique tradition; Pennsyl- _

vania is one of the only three
states‘ giving aid to private in-
stitutions. '
Dr. Cale revealed that already -

in_ the governor's budget are _ap-
propriations of $4,428,442 for. gen-

eral maintenance and operation ,
of the University, $1,291,620 for-

the School of Medicine, $98,000

Faculty Assembly Meets,  
  Considers Money Problems

By ALAN DISLER
At its Spring meeting
Thursday, the Faculty Sen-
ate discussed the ﬁnancial
situation of the Uni_versity

and entertained a proposal

"that the Senate elect a mem-
ber to the Board of 'I‘rustees.

After the preliminary commit-
tee reports were heard, .a study‘
committee discussed the progress
the University has made in the
last ten years. A plea was‘ di_-
rected ‘to the Trustees that ma-
jor changes in the University be
made in consultation with the
faculty and not totally indepen-
dent of it. The committee also
indicated theneed for more fac-
ulty - administration communica-_

tion. I ,
The assembly then turned to

a proposal from the Division of’

the Natural Sciences which would
provide for a member of the
Board of Trustees being selected
by the faculty. It was stressed,
however, that this member would
be chosen from outside the Uni-

versity in order to" dispel charges "_

of self-interest.
In the following discussion it

was brought out that the Senate .

had -not been given enough time
to consider-‘all aspectsof the mo-
tion- The proposal was tabled
until the Fall meeting by a vote
of 85 to 59. ,

ing chancellor, who presided -over

Three Fraternities Hit ,

For Orientation Rush

By ALEX D’IPPOLI'l‘0 .-

Three fraternities have had their fall rushing privil.
eges suspended disclosed reliable student sources. The fra-
ternities are Pi Lambda Phi, Phi Epsilon Pi, and Sigma
Alpha _Mu. , _ » . '
‘ The action was _taken by the Dean of Men’s Office as

‘a result of rushing violations during thefirst "orientation

session, June 13 to 16. '

The action will be subject to appeal after freshmen camp in
September, the sources said. Depending upon good behavior during

the remainder of the orientation program, the suspensions ‘may be re- -

scinded and full rushing privileges restored. _

Parker Enwright, assistant dean of men in_ charge of fraternities,
would neither con-ﬁrm nor deny the report “because the damage
done can be personal.” - -'

Dean Enwright admitted that action had been taken as a result
of -rush violations but would not disclose the fraternities involved

_ or the _speciﬁc*'violations.“‘We know-exactly -who did it (the rush -

violations), what was said, and where it was done,” he said, but

declined to give any further details. “We don’t take action without

speciﬁcs,” he added. ’

“Any action taken is subject to appeal,” Dean Enwright said.;
In explaining why no information is being made public, he said that _

disciplinary measures are of a personal and conﬁdential nature and
of concern only to thom ‘parties involved. _

He denied that fraternity men were being isolated from the Uni-
versity during orientation" or that_any attempt was being made to

. hide Greeks from freshmen.

Dean Enwright said that official policy states that “fraternity
rushing is deﬁned as any action _or' activity involving a freshman
which might tend to inﬂuence him to join (or not join) a particular
fraternity. This was the rule violated during orientation," he con-
cluded’. '

i‘kStudent Attacks
Trustees’ Views T

f7Editor, The Pitt News:

In recent weeks the University
has been plagued with stinging
denunciations of the Litchﬁeld
Tladministration and its ﬁscal poli-
'cies. One of our trustees felt the

gresigned. Yet as you so aptly
pointed out in your editorial The
“"S.0anegoat,~ this man as a _mem-
er. of the Board of .Trustees
;._'should have made it his busi-
,ness to keep abreast‘ of the
f7sch_ool’s‘ expenditures "and its ﬁ-
linancial situation as a whole. It

;_.to intimidate that the debt was
“held in a clandestine manner.

Dr. Litchﬁeld has had_ to strug-
__ lelwith an element of provin.-
xcialism in many of the large don-
I?-ors, trustees, and alumni. This
is’ almost unheard of in any
other reputable private universi-
ty. These people’ now claim that
jtheir money is not being proper-
-_l.,ly administered, .and thus have
'='suspended donations. Their mon-

.situ.ation so intolerable that he

‘is "not sufficient for this trustee '

ey has not been ill spent; but
rather _this University has re-
fused to abide with their policies
of unwaranted regionalism and
mediocrity. Our. Chancellor too
well appreciates the value ofldi-.
versiﬁcation in the student body
and high faculty standards to ac-
commodate those non-scholarly
persons who would have our
growth retarded with supposed

-“obligations to this community as

opposed to scholarship as a whole.
We no longer seek to encourage
donations from men who wish
little more than self-gloriﬁcation;
however we encourage donors
whose. sole purpose is to further"
themerit of this University.

' It is thus essential to keep
our present Chancellor in, his

V position as guider and innovator,

to avoid being intimidated by
those moneyed interests whose

imotivesu are so obviously soiled.

When -this University no longer
suits their needs, might I sug-
gest that they take their capital
to’ a school that does not mind
being an academic prostitute.

Editor, The Pitt News: ’
We hope you can ﬁnd space for

this correction of‘ an incorrect _‘

and editorial (June 23) about

You quote me as saying that
“the infractions -were rather
vague,” “not deﬁnable,” etc‘ im-
plying that we acted without
clearly determined facts. The

editorial ‘cites fraternity protests“

that “no proof of speciﬁc viola-

and “_they_' don't have any proof.”

Certainly, there are _always

unethical and unfair to take ac-

or "an organization on such an
unspeciﬁc basis. _

_ By ED EOBERSON

There has been around
this University for a long
"time (and I have the basis
for such‘ long memories) a
desperate pleading for some

- kind of intellectual dialogue

outside of the classroom litany.
Past editors of The Pitt News-
have screamed their editorials
against everything from apathy

0 to .aardvarks:. And no reply. Edi-

tors of the lit magazines have
accumulated vastly talented and
larg<.~—hear!—large staffs of ar-

‘ gumentative young people, only

to have them die of the hopeless
inbreeding of isolated talk. ‘
Their descendents have tried
lfitt News supplements, corﬁee
hours,’ and private mimeo produc-
tions. All with the same resultant
death by the s/mothering "ist-
lence. Now,
about to be a new and more poig-
nant funeral to attend. A new
publication under the name of
NOMOS was last week walked its
13 steps up to your dull atten-
tions. This publication is the best
lamb offered to the altar yet.
Physically, it is highly appeal-
ing. The Vey and Becca draw-
ings do what I so like about those
in The New York Review of
Books and sometimes The Na-
tion. That is, they step artfully
above simple caricature to good

expressive graphics, to art. As

for its content NOMOS does not
contain high literature. But then

Norman Mailer would hardly stay _

at Pitt: 2+ minutes of Patter-
son:- Liston does prove painfully

' to be more interesting than a year

of, the traditional dialogue at this
university.

But NOMOS is not of that tradi-
tion. And the presence of some-
one eleequally alien. to that dis-
ease, such as Dr. Colodny, is go-
in: to give‘ our funeral class. I
am not politically competent to

_ answer Dr. Colodny. I A’ pray

someone else think he is. Then
what he is trying to do, and
what is so much the basi of Dr.
LiDson’s discontented article, will
be started. Dr. Colodny’s eloquent
first P5Il'88'.I'aDh is the answer to
D1‘. Lipson’s charges.

friends, "there is '

Lipson states 1 the disaffection
of the student toward the uni-
versity. We all know the words

to_th.at song_of un-love: “Nobody.

knows the trouble I feel,” per-
haps, sung by students quite
troubled in their minds. And
when the administrative-nobody
really does not listen, the stu-
dents take up various wander-
ing of the mind chanties in the
Student Union. . ‘

Dr. Lipson proposes what seems

like only more talk of o_rganiza-_ _

tion. Dr. Colodny has stated his
‘hopes in that‘ ﬁrst paragraph in-
troducing his bodily entrance in-
to the reparation by the Vietnam
article, This is the more reason
to lament should this endeavor
die in its initial steps._ ,

A similar set of poles exists
in the other two NOMOS articles.

Miss Brooks’ article is the weak-

est inthe publication. But weak-

. ness is sometimes turned into -an

exclusive "style. And excluded

from ‘.‘The Question” are all per- .

sons who do not share Miss
Brooks’ retreat from sequential
order—alienation, the big buck-
et, contains Miss Brooks. Where-
as Mr. Panksepp has taken a re-
sponsible stand for his interest in
Robinson Jeﬂers.

The poets of the last half of

the 20th century are notoriously

anti-university in that they too
tire of the textbook formulas and

this century's version of the con- '

ceit of the 17th. As far away
from the Then as the conceit put
their poems, even further dis-
tant has become the metaphor
nowfrom Now.

And no amount of teaching can
make a museum piece as perti-
nent to. the body as today's-—this
day’s — hunger. Jeffers tries;
Panksepp points out his accep-
tance of science as such an at-
tempt to set up the dialogue with
the present that has been so
long ' silence.

 Reviewer Predicts rDeath   of ‘NOMOS’
espite W orthwhile Opening Attempt

NOMOS, dedicated to the Dialo-
gue, has published a good piece

. and a willing critic in Panksepp.

Yet that it has to “dedicate”. it-
self to something that should be
‘a common occurrence here. is a
distraction. The effort to remem-

- her that though NOMOS is a re-

negade production. Panksepp is
no excitingly racy rebel himself
but a literate man is an effort. I
am ashamed has to be takenin
this "community. . -

The publication is independent; .

put out ‘by a small group of
friends without—as I understand
——oificial University support, with
the support of A ‘the usual few
professors and directors whose
names have always been buried
with the other attempts.

NOMOS seems to be a hope as
well as an indictment of the Uni-
versity. It is a hope because in its
initial issue it states the discon-
tent.(Dr. Lipson) and then by its

. attentions, by its existence, goes

to the root——the student’s dis-
trust of professors and the very
learning they are here to attain
—-and’ commits itself to the act

of understanding. Done by out- .

siders it is an indication, ﬁnally,
of the service the outside discon-
tented wish to" perform for the
University. . 1

It is also an indication of the

. disservice done by - the Universi-

ty to these people, its own stu-

dents, in that these people know '

that in a similar sized university
they would be “the disgustingly
normal.” They are not the arti-
culate barbarian that seems to be
the administrative pleasure these
days,‘ yet they are hardly the
brilliant and informed innova-
tors which they know, some-
where within, this campus lacks.

The other day a remark was

Then the fatal question came
up. Was it just maturation or
were they whipped back by some

comb? Be still, there _is another
silent funeral goingon for
NOMOS, friend."

ﬂexibility. . 
We believe it’s the key '
to a working life in- .
surance program.
Changing ‘conditions
in a man’s life call for
protection that’s adap-
table to a variety of
situations in the fu-
ture. Some policies are
more so than others
and it's well to exam- '
ine the differences.

Our Personal Plan-
ning Service was "de-
veloped with an eye to
flexibility and thefu-
ture, too. It .0fi"ers a
comprehensive and
permanent record of
._vour financial affairs;
we think it deserves
more than a casual
look. i

You’re invited to stop

service could be of real
beneﬁt to -you in your
financial planning.
We'll be glad to show
you what we mean by
ﬂexible life insurance
plans, too.

‘NOMOS’Retains

 by By the decision of itsgrrent staff, NOMOS now holds
the status of an independent and private publication with-
fout official University affiliation. At the Ju_ne~18 meeting
_T'0f the Student Publications Board, editorial representatives
_of the new publication rejected the conditions NOMOS would
Q have to accept in order to be classified as a student publica-

tion. ' ’ ' ~ . ~
Funds would have been handled through the University ﬁnancial
office if NOMOS were a student publication. Also an- advisory board
would appoint an editor and Business manager and would periodically

expressed their appreciation of the editorial and ﬁnancial support
_they had "received fromsthe University community. Dr. Abe Laufe,
‘associate professor of English, questioned their inclusion of faculty.

Dr. Cale went on in the ques-
tion and answer session to fur-
ther reaffirm the fact that if
anyiconcessions are made to the
state the ratio of Pennsylvania
to out of state students would
not exceed a four to one ratio

‘for the" general maintenance of
"the library school and equip-
ment, and $30,000 for the Jonas
‘E. Salk Professorship. ’
On top of this is the Universi-
;ty's emergency grant and a bill
{called “little Joe” to .reduce tui-
jtilons, as well as separate bills
(still in (process), appropriating
.money for the Phipps Conserva-
tory, maintenance, the law school,
_the computer center, the dental
school, _and text books. .
 Commenting on the degree to
',which the University maybe-come
jstate affiliated, Dr. Cale cited
several possibilities. First, the
. University could 4 become another
Temple University if the state.
‘_“can provide an additional $1 mil-
ion, over and above the basic .
equality grant, for every $100 the
{tuition is lowered. ‘
 ‘Temple's tuition will be $450
‘per year’! but for the University’s
$1,400 yearly tuition to drop to
‘$450 yearly “isn’t realistic.”

‘‘ -The University “might” become
'.a contract school, Dr. Cale con-
tinued, a performing certain serv-
ices which the state pays for and

University’s ﬁnancial state. A dis-

cussion on his remarks followed.
Some members felt that the ad-
ministration’s attempts’, to illum-
inate the situation had been in
fact uninformative. Dr. Crawford,
in a statement following the
meeting said‘ that the situation
was explained as well as it could
have been at this time. .
Concerning more immediate
matter-s, the group felt that the

.“No unusual expansion other
than the normal yearly purchases
is planned,” stated Miss Salis-
bury. She added that the library,
will be" open only to art students
or others who need to use the ma-
terial in the library. September
hours for the first ﬂoor library
have not been set, although Miss
Salisbury thought they would be
“probably the same as the reg-
ular fine arts library hours.”

Dr. Hovey and Miss Lewis

However, Dr. William‘ C. Loerke, .

the department chairman, his

Robert Lord, the University or-
zanist and associate professor-'of
music, will ,take charge of the
organ that Miss Frick -brought to

- the ‘building from her home in
Pride’s ‘Crossing, Mass.

- In consultation with "Miss Frick,
a search has been started to set
up an advisory board of art and
museum scholars to exercise con-
tinuing direction of the building.

Miss Frick has donated a new
endowment of an undisclosed
amount for the director. and his
staff, the library staff and addi-
tions, a security force, and cus-
todial and maintenance services.

The Frick ﬁne arts department

.of the University emphasizes re-

search into the history of art,
rather than painting and design
itself. According to Miss Salis-
bury, the museum will, exhibit
“collections of bronzes, paintings,
and porce.lains" in the first floor

' rotunda areas.

“I hope students can ﬁnd a new
outlet artistically in the Frick
building,” ‘Dr Hovey said, “both
in theory and in practice.
