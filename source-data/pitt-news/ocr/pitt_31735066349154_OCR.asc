Surveys to determine student
perceptions regarding Pitt’s health
services have been completed by
the Student Health Advisory
Committee (SHAC), according to
Committee Chairperson Marc D.
Hiller.

“The survey is’ an effort
undertaken by students to evaluate
the perceived needs, attitudes, and

\ desires of .-the student population

for health care,” Hiller explained.

-y



 

Rising costs for medical services
have necessitated that changes be
made within the health care
program,’ according to Student
Health Service Director Joanne K.
Robinson. '

“With respect to the fact that—

costs keep going up, the University

will probably have to ﬁnd different . -:.

means to ﬁnance the health
service,” Hiller said. “We want to"
ﬁnd what students desire in health
care, cut out what they don ’t want

and guarantee the aspects that ﬁt'

their needs and desires.”
According to a written proposal

information obtained from the

  Political Modifications r

  Discussed at Forum

BY DENNIS KELLY B

Different approaches to chang-
ing the American political. system

were discussed by representatives‘

of three campus political groups
‘Friday at the Militant Forum in the
Student -Union- °

Phil Davis, Greg Glister ‘and
Steffi Brooks, the speakers at the
forum, agreed to the need for
change in government today.

Davis, president of the College
Young Republicans, said “we
achieve change in this country
through the ballet box,” and

supported the existing. two-party
syst_em.

“The problem is the people we
put in ofﬁce,” Davis said.

According to Davis, Democratic
control of Allegheny County for the
past 40 years has achieved bad
roads, a 10% unemployment rate,‘
a payroll bloated with patronage,
no public transportation system, a
corrupt assessment system and an
increasing number of industries
leaving the area. ‘

“We need office holders’ who
hold no political debts, who don’t
have any big brothers, who have no
commitments to anybody. We
need fresh ideas and approaches to
government in Allegheny County,”
Davis said. -

Davis added that socialism will
not work because the candidates
are inexperienced and are running
local campaigns on national issues.

“Socialism is an economic
system, not a political philosophy.

. It is a system where you say you're
giving power to the people and
actually you're giving power to the

7state,’’ Davis said. “The state,’ in

my mind, already haswtoo much.

power.” .

‘Glister, president‘. of the College-if

   
 
 
 

Young Democrats, advocated
change from within the system.
Glister called for the Socialists to

join the Democrats and work for 0

change in the system.

“The Socialists say they don’t‘

want to compromise,” Glister. said.
He asked ‘Socialists, “Do you want
to work in the system and promote
your views and educate people
towardthose views, or do you want

’ to stayon the outside of the two

main parties and try_ to ‘convert
people, and then take over the
system?” .

“If the Socialists are adamant in

their standof no compromise, they ~

must realize the unsuccessfulness

of it,” Glister said. A
Brooks, president of the Young

Socialist Alliance and the Socialist

~Workers Pary candidate for Alle-

gheny County Commissioner,
stated that problems. in this country
stem from the fact that 1.2% of the
population owns and controls 80%
of our economic resources. _

“In the" spring of 1975, the
manufacturing -economy of the
United States was operating at
under 70% of its capacity. This
waste of human ‘ and technical
resources is nothing less than
criminal,” Brooks said. .

“The Republican President and
Democratic Congress have no
answers to the current economic
crisis except to tighten our belts.

“These _ problems could be
solved fairly easily with no magic
tricks,” she stated.

Brooks outlined five steps to
improve ‘our situation:

--The $100-billion defense bud-
get would be put to use to build
-hospitals, schools, day-care cen-
ters, mass-transit systems and
social services. .

‘Deep Throat, scheduled for a

took it upon themselves to make a

“The question was raised by
Meloro as to why the pursuance (of
the issue),” Silverberg said. “He

wanted to know if it was just‘

sensationalism or if we genuinely
wanted to raise funds.” .

Meloro said the ARA could raise

Tuition Hike Defense -0  1

Prepared for Future

BY TOMAWASELESKI I

A program to help’ future Student

Government Board (SGB) members p

combat tuition hikes ‘is being
prepared by SGB member Mark

The report he plansto ﬁle with .

lessons Pitt students have learned
this year, strategies that have been
successful on other campuses, and
the administration’s plans for
averting any new hikes, Satinoff
said. ' .
The SGB admittedly was caught

off guard last summer when Pitt t

tuition was raised 14%.

"Satinoff was one of the more
vocal Board members in calling for
the public release of the level-one
budget-, the .University’s detailed
list of the year’s total expenditures.

He plans to consult with ‘the
National Student Association” and
the National Student Lobby for
information on how other schools
effectively have met tuition in-
creases and programs’ cutbacks.

“Education is a right, not a
privilege,” Satinoff : said, citing
various methods students used at
other institutions faced _ with

Meloro said Allocations, as an
arm of Student Government, dealt‘
with the funding request on two
levels. The consensus was that the

ARA could make as much or more \

money showing another ﬁlm.
“The broader question con-
cerned ethics—this is not an act the

“This is a process of involving

We have to hold open, well-built

CIO, various unions—can show
their support. .

He said the 2,000 letters sent

through the START-UP drive
showed students’ concern, but that
their energy was mischanneled.
, Satinoff said he didn’t believe
the administration’s plans would
be as crucial to his program as the
‘information gathered from other
sources. I

Citing the administration’s re-
fusal last summer to publicize the
University’s level-one budget, he
said, “They keep secrets from the
student body and their only excuse
for not releasing the level-one is a
feeble -one: Students won7t
understand it.

“After all, are the administrators
our allies and friends or are their
interests opposed to ours?” Satin-
off asked; .

Satinoff said he would speak with
Pitt officials in regard to his
program, but he didn’t expect any
signiﬁcant results. . ;

  Union on the Horizon

The sparks are beginning to ﬂy across campus over the Burger Chef
ﬁring of student employe Barbara Ranck allegedly for attempting to

organize a grievance committee.

Previously student ernployes had irregular paydays and alleged
wage inequalities of which to complain. Now employer-employe
conflicts no doubt will intensify the new possibility that employes could

beﬁredforattempingtoorganize.

Although calls for student unionization may have been premature
earlierthis term, the situation apparently changed and some stiffer

measures may be in order.

Day—to-day gripes of job relations are one thing, but ﬁrings for public
circulation of opinions are unjustiﬁable. -

Corporate employers who ﬁre students for attempting to organize

arehopelesslyoutofplawonacampusthatseekstofosteropen,

' liberal thought.

Burger Chef and other employers on campus have a strong ability to
maintain their manipulation of student workers, ﬁrst, since there’s no
organization of student workers, and, second since there’s a practically
inexhaustible pool of student labor from which workers can be tapped

continuously.

Such a position of control hardly can be overcome without effective
student-worker organization. After the ﬁring at Burger Chef and the
more sober light it has cast on events, there may be little else for

student workers to do than to start thinking union.

Interested in Interest

The call by Student Government Board (SGB) President Iarry Platt
for students to be permitted to control the interest generated by their
student activities fee is wel1—made and deserves the thoughtful

consideration of the administration.

Fstimated to be $5,000 per annum, the interest couldlbe used in
nanny ways for student groups. And since the activities fee is meant to

fm1djustthat,allthemoneyfromthefee,nomatterthroughwhieh

quirk of management it’s' generated, should be applied to student



T_he SGB and its Allocations Committee have the same problems in
managing a ﬁscal budget that the University has. Many would go so
far as to point out that the SGB has it even worse, because it has far
fewer sources from which to appeal for ﬁmds. In this respect, the
Board has fewer options in allocating its ﬁmds and there is little chance
to “remanage” its money once it has been doled out. _

A compromise measure supported by both the administration and
the Board would have the interest at least earmarked for student use.
This would give student allocators a margin of ﬁscal comfort in
appropriating funds ‘when things get tight at the end of the budgetary

year, as they normally do.

The $5,000 is only a rniniscule part of this year’s University budget of
$145. 7 million. The power of the money would be more directly felt if it
could be charmeled back into the student activities from which it

originates. .

Questions to ponder

Tomorrow’s election

The Socialists on tl1eRun

Editor’s Note: _In' light of
tomorrow’s county elections, the
Pitt News is running columns .by
representatives of‘ the contending

' parties. Here are the endorsements

and the platform of the Socialist
Workers party. '

BY BlLL KALMAN

It is ﬁtting that election day
comes so soon after Halloween.
The Democrats and Republicans
lurk ‘about in masks like “Big
Change,” “Together ‘ We Can
Make It Work,” “Good Judges,”
and _ “Good Candidates." And
under all the advertising, there are
the same old parties, up to the
same old tricks.

They offer working people more
inﬂation and unemployment, more
racism and sexism, more tuition
increases and social service cut-
backs. All their “experience” and

  The Tyrannyof the Pill

BY MONICA. KIMICATA

‘ One of the many dilemmas a lot -

of college women encounter is, as
McCall’s writer Alice Lake puts it,
trying to safely free themselves
from ‘the “tyranny of the reproduc-
tive organs."

' lrejoice over the fact we can now
choose whether or not to have
babies, and I revel in the freedom
we now have to reshape our ideas
about womanhood and (eventually)
the world we live in. But I shudder
each time I hear about another
possible side effect of our most
widely known emancipator—the
birth control pill.

The Pill is used now by 10 to 14
million women in the United
States—one third of all women
seeking birth control. But despite

. its popularity, the debate about its

safety “gives any women who
takes the Pill," as stated in a recent
Ms. article, “the right and perhaps
the obligation to understand just
how experimental the Pill still is."

When the Federal Drug Admin-
istration (FDA) consented‘ to the
marketing of the Pill in the late
1950s, there were no laws stating
the manufacturer had to give proof
of his product's safety. The FDA
has no data that the Pill was
dangerous at the time and
therefore it was approved for
marketing.

Recent research by the New York
Department of Health has found
that serious skeletal birth defects
ranging from a missing ﬁnger or

Al toe to a missing limb possibly could

be linked to the exposure ot women

- in the early. stages of pregnancy to

the artiﬁcial hormones in the Pill.

Research linking the Pill tocancer
of the cervix still is going on. Lake
tells us that “although several

reports suggejstv that Pill‘ usersgare,

 

‘ more likely to have lesions of the

cervix (which may, but notalways,
lead to cancer), there is no proof of
a cause-and-effect relationship."
In some cases, the Pill can make.
a woman permanently infertile.
And the Ms. article goes on to say
that endocrineand liver function
tests can be affected by the Pill.
“Conditions exacerbated by ﬂuid
retention, such as epilepsy, mi-
graine. asthma, cardiac or kidney

you have any history of depression
you should be carefully observed,
for under the inﬂuence of the Pill it \
may recur. The deﬁnitive influ-
ence of prolonged-Pill use on your
pituitary. ovarian, adrenal, liver or
uterine functions await further
study." . ,

These ambiguous ﬁndings are
very disquieting since they rein-
force the fact that doctors are not
really sure of the metabolic effects
of the Pill. Researchers have stated
that no tissue or organ is free from
the effects of contraceptive ster-
oids, and no one knows just where
all of these metabolic changes are
leading.

Yet, women who are not sick still
are being allowed to take these
powerful hormonal drugs every
day. And many doctors believe
certain immediate side effects of
the Pill. such as hair loss. weight
gain, vaginal infections, nausea.-
anxiety and loss of sex drive are
only psychological or emotional
reactions. .

But if the dangers of taking the
Pill are as yet unknown, women
should not let themselves be intim-
idated by their doctors or peers
who knowingly or unknowingly are
suggesting their bodies be used for.
experimentation. '

The American Medical Associa- '
tion (AMA) does not recommend

another. but it does recognize the
Pill as the most effective of all
contraceptives when taken as
directed. “Severe problems are
relatively rare." said the AMA in a
1970 statement, “and the majority
of women who would like to use the
pill can do so ‘safely and
effectively." However, the AMA
docs urge periodic examinations in
order to detect any possible side
effects. ' ‘

A McCall’s poll of 200 young
women doctors stated two of three
of them recommended the Pill to
their patients and only "one in three
is using it herself. Half ._of these
doctors are former -Pill users; 43%
of them stopped using the Pill
because of undesirable side effects.

Dr. Bernadine Z. Paulshock MD
said in her Toda_v’s Health-article
about birth control, “Many of the
side effects of oral contraceptives
are subtle changes in blood
chemistry which may not appear
until the Pill has been taken for
years...Fortunately, serious prob-
lems have occured in only a very
small percentage of the millions of
women who take the Pill, but at

present there is no way to predict.

who will be affected."

In essence, the Pill is a vast and
risky experiment, the‘ results of
which do affect the women who use
it and possibly their unborn
children, not the men who
developed and prescribe it.

Therefore it is crucial that when
any young woman is considering a
birth-control method—'especially
the pill—she should become

familiar /with her own medical.

history, that of her family, and the
physical and emotional cycles of
her body. She should notbe afraid

“qualiﬁcations” are in the -same
old system of robbing the poor to
pay the rich. If the “Good
Candidates” .really stood for the
kind of “Big Change" we need,
they would not be inside the racist
parties licking the boots of big
business. They would not say
“Vote for me and I'll’set you free"
every four years, and spend the
time between elections collecting
kickbacks and presiding over
human misery.

The only candidates in this
election who represent a real
alternative are the socialists: Neil
Berns and Stephanie Brooks for
Allegheny County commissioner,
Christina Adachi forcounty con-
troller, and Susan Beek,_ Howard
Beck, Virginia Burke, Paul LeBlanc
and Thomas Twiss for Pittsburgh
City Council. These candidates
represent the Socialist Workers
Party and call for a fundamental
change in American society.

The Socialist Workers Party is
a year in
movements to change society—to
end school segregation, to repeal
anti-abortion laws, to improve the
standard of living of working
people, to defend democratic
rights, to stop tuition hikes, etc.

The socialist candidates run on
this record in struggle. They take a
clear stand on the big issues in this
election—-not vague promises, but
realistic programs to solve our
social problems through indepen-
dent mass action. They call on
voters to support the socialist
alternative as a step in organizing a
powerful movement to change the
economic and political system from
capitalism—which puts private
proﬁts ahead ‘of human needs, to
socialism—the democratic owner-
ship and control of major industries
to provide the necessities of life to
everyone. V

The socialist program, based on
the needs and demands of working
people, includes: .

1. Immediate desegregation of

the Pittsburgh public schools by

means of busing.

2. A massive public works

program to build schools,vhous-

These are realistic solutions, ’

demands on which can be
implemented if the potential power
of working people is organized
effectively. The Socialist Workers
Party aims to win support for this
program in the unions, black‘ and
feminist organizations, and on the
campuses, to unite billions of
people to work for these changes.

Many people who agree with the
socialist program think they ‘can
ﬁnd some sort of shortcut by
supporting Democrats or Republi-
cans, some of whose promises
might sound good. After all, they
say, it's “expedient" to support

candidates who can win. lnde{‘f.-

Democrats and Republicans get
more votes than socialist-s at this
point, but who wins?

Do students “win” when they
support the politicians who cut

back funds for education? Do black ‘

people “win” when they support
the up-South opponents of dese-
gregation? Do working people
“win" when they support “friends
of labor" who pass anti-strike laws
and cut back social services?
Eugene Debs was speaking to
these closet socialists when he
said, “lt’s better to vote for what
you want, and not get it, than to
vote for what you don’t want, and
get it." _
Socialists seek to change society
through the power of independent

mass political action, like the giaiﬁig

antiwar demonstrations, the mar-
ches of the Civil Rights movement,
the United Farm Workers boycott
and other union actions. They are
not elitists, hoping for a few good
words or deeds from an individual
politician—especially a Democrat
or Republican.

A vote for Democrats or
Republicans is a wasted vote. The
majority of people qualiﬁed to vote
‘realize that when they don't vote.
But there is a way to make your
vote count. A vote for the Socialist
Workers Party shows your support
for a program of meaningful,
democratic social change. It is a

BY w. JACK ROMBERG

Every once in a while, there is an

‘ issue thatseems so obvious, it

seems ridiculous anyone could
oppose it. Indeed, this would seem
to be ..the case with the Equal
Rights Amendment (ERA). Logic-
ally, the amendment would seem to
be merely a conﬁrmation of one of
the basic tenets of America; that
everyone is equal under the law.

This, however, is not the case.
Instead of accepting the obvious
conﬁrmation, a variety of groups,
ranging from fundamentalists to
the Communist party, oppose the
amendment with a series of
rationalizations that boggles the
mind.

Most of these rationalizations,

I such as the ERA would destroy the
Boy Scouts or force women into the

army, are too silly to honor with a
reply. But in all probability, these
are not the_ real reasons many
people oppose the ERA.

Whether or not we admit it, all
men have a secret fear of a sort of
mental castration by women. Men
have grown used to playing the

I V roles of problem solver, comforter

and storer of knowledge. The great
inﬂux of women into the business,
intellectual and political worlds
threatens these roles. These are

A much more subtle roles than the

traditional sexual roles. The sexual
exploitation of women is much
more obvious than the mental

‘ subjugation.

Many men, probably even most
men, are learning to accept women

as equal partners in society. But

there are many men who are not
able to overcome the gut feeling of

‘ -T  .15age-‘6—~THE'Pi1T NEWS;-Monday‘,November-'3', ii975

  ofthcERA

Reaching the Rest of

being threatened. It is these. who
are worried about the sanctity of

-the Boy Scouts and Little League
baseball. ’ Appeals by women’s"

groups are not going to encourage
any man to change his mind over
the ERA. But feeling can be
overcome only by cold, hard facts
that show women are contributing
in economically and socially valu-
able ways. Further, these facts
should be presented by men who
already have accepted the equality
of women. .
But more disturbing than the
opposition of men to the ERA is the
opposition of women. Women are
recruited into the anti-ERA move-
ment for a variety of reasons,
ranging from fear for the tradi-
tional family structure to fear for
maintaing separate bathrooms.
Why is it that women’s rights
leaders’ have failed to convince
these women of the necessity of the
ERA? Are they merely less
educated or do they really believe
the ERA threatens their traditional
values? »
i This problem is as much
psychological for the women as it is
for the men. That is not to say that
women who support the ERA live
in fear of their husbands, but, that
something in the women’s move-
ment has turned them away from
what would seem to be a clear
question of necessity in any

‘ woman's mind.

The great bulk’ of women
detractors of the ERA . are-
undoubtedly women whose live
center around the traditional roles
of mother and housewife. The more
radical elements of the women's
movement have downgraded these

roles, thereby unintentionally

downgrading the lives of millions of
American women. The ERA, a
culmination of the work of the
women's movement, is a logical

target for a reaction against what
many women feel is overly radical. .

Perhaps the best way to deal
with these- attitudes is for other
women to assure their more
traditional contemporaries that
they do respect them. It is a
common mistake of women who are
more educated to look down on
those who are not, just as people in
general tend to look down on those
who are less educated. But this
mist-ake is more costly to the
women's movement, because it
needlessly alienates a large body of
potential supporters. What should
be stressed is that the role of
housewife or mother is a worth-
while alternative only if it is freely
chosen. But once chosen, it is
valuable.

This does not imply that a
majority of people oppose the ERA,
In fact, the public favors it by a

' three-to-one margin, but one fourth

of the country is too large ‘a
minority to ignore. Further, al-

' though the ERA already has passed

in 34 states, four more are needed

to make the amendment law, and it I
is the anti-amendment forces that I

are gathering momentum.

The only way to pick up the ﬁnal
few votes needed for passage is by

"I,

In my articleientitled “Dems and
GOP on the Run," published on
Friday, the county commissioner
candidates for the Democratic

To ensure that both parties may air
their platforms for county commis-
sioner, I ask that you print the
following:

This election will determine how
Allegheny County will be run for
the next four years. It will

determine whether this county will"

maintain an overview geared
towards human services with a
minimum of costs or if it Wlll be

‘ geared towards “false" efﬁciency

with a minimum of human services.
The Tom Foerster-Jim Flaherty
Team for county commissioners

‘has pledged itself to work for

human services while keeping a
rein on the increasing costs of
maintaining these services.

Tom Foerster believes that
county government can be ‘made
more effective by increasing
computerization of county depart-
ments. He has also stated that
Allegheny County should demand
full federal and state reimburse-
ments for mandated health and
welfare agencies, thus relieving
county taxpayers of supporting
such programs. . .

Jim Flaherty thinks that county
government can cut waste, consoli-
date overlapping functions, hire
and promote on merit," encourage
competition producing better
prices by seeking more bids on
county contracts, and to demand
that the state accept greater
responsibility for social programs,
roads and public transit costs.

I also ask that you print the

that the rights of the defendent
must be kept in mind. The citizens -
are entitled to a decent, law-abid-
ing way of life, just as the

Day and the class members bring
their children. .
“Watch the children. They don't
want to leave...This is what every

school could have," Campbell said. .

Notebook in hand, I wandered
over to the cookie-decorating table
and a sign thatasaid “Love me,
Squeeze me, Take me home.”

Children and adults clustered
around the table, decorating
cookies and trying to cope with the
icing-ﬁlled pipettes.

Munching‘a cookie, I moved to
the music center two steps away. A
class" member, tuning fork in hand,
said to an interested little boy,-
“Wanna hear something near?"

Hitting the tuning fork on the
bottom of his foot, he held it near
the boy's ear. Fascinated, the boy
demanded. “Tell me how does it do
that?"

The reaction of Campbell's
students to the open-classroom
concept is similar to the one
expressed by Carol Tomko, a junior
with a self-designed major in early

childhood education and social
change.
“I ﬁrmly believe that open

education can be beneﬁcial to a lot
of students. Learning shouldn’t
have to be tortuous and boring, but
this seems to be the case for many
students of all ages,” Tomko said.

Soon I noticed children and
adults running around with painted
faces’. One person, laughing,
"remarked, “I saw the kids doing it
so I had to do it, too.” One little

Two ladies joined the group, which
had formed around the animal, and
began to question along with the
children. After 10 minutes,’ one
turned to the other‘ and said
triumphantly‘. “See, I’ve learned
something tonight." Everyone was
learning, the “teachers” as well as
the children.

While the potentials for growth
are obvious to those involved with
the open classroom, they also see
its disadvantages. “The disadvan-
tage and one of the reasons why I
think it’s taking so long for open
education to become more wide-

  New University Senate President
Faces F aculty’s Lack of Interest  

BY PAUL MAZUR

Faced with faculty apathy,
prospects for unionization and few
consultationsof the faculty by the
administration before policy deci-
sions are made, the persuasive-
speaking William J. Brown, asso-
ciate professor of law, has taken
overthe reins of the University
Senate as its new president.

' Brown succeeds Frank G.
Slaughter, .Ir., associate professor
of mathematics.

With a rather disarming smile,
Bro.wn, who graduated from Yale
Law School in 1968, spoke about
the various problems facing the
Senate this year. _ . -

The newly elected Senate presi-
dent was an assistant professor at
Catholic University before coming
to Pitt. His main concern here is
the lack of faculty input into
administrative decisions. .

“(I'd like to see _the faculty have

increased._influence over policy in

the University.” he said. “In the
past, the University Senate has
functioned more as an information-
al body, but it should be
consulted."

The administration’s consulta-
tion with the Senate could take
place through three important
committees which, Brown says, are
now only “reactive."

“The committees’ for Tenure and
Academic Freedom, Educational
Policies and Budget Policies still
only look at things after they've
happened," Brown, former chair-
person of'TAF, complained. “If
something. has to be developed as
policy, there has to be discussion."

Yet that kind of discussion is
hampered by the lack of faculty
participation and interested in
Senate meetings.

At the October 2 Senate meeting,
for example, fewer than 85 of the
2,150 faculty members of the
Senate were present. (All faculty
members are members of the

University Senate’ and only 100
members are needed for a
_quorum.)

One explanation for faculty.‘

apathy, according to Brown,’might
be the feeling of resignation to the
inevitability of administrative de-
cisions.

“We—Barbara K. Shore (Senate
vice president), Mary L. Dimmick
(Senate secretary) and I—will send
out letters exhorting our colleagues
to show at these meetings,” said
Brown, who is also a“member of the
Affirmative Action Committee.

Administrative decisions without
faculty input have not been the
Senate's only problem. Efforts at
interfering with the internal prob-

lems of the state-related universi-

ties by members of the state
legislature also cause concern.
For example, the Shane Amend-
ment called for the elimination of
all tuition-remission programs at
state and state-related colleges and

large number of creative ideas and
projects would have to be planned
and a teacher would have to be

willing to spend time with the-

student involved in various areas of
study while remaining students are
involved at other interest centers,”
Tomko said.

Sometimes it's also hard for

students to change. It’s not easy to-
direct one's own learning after.

at Pitt. If there is enough effort
from the teacher and student, it can
work and be apleasant alternative
to the boring classes so many of us
have experienced,” Tomko said.

I In the room, chaos reigned-

There were so many different
activities taking. place‘, that it
became frustrating. There was so
much to see and not enough time to
really look. One thing I couldn't
miss, however, was the children.

Receptions aren’t- held in the

has no kitchen facilities.

Large wedding or small? . It
would seem if one chose to marry in
the Chapel, one would want to do it
up right, with all the trimmings.
But Beukema said the big wedding
is the exception.

“I’d say these weddings gener- _‘ 

ally reflect the socioeconomic
status of the students who attend
Pitt,” he began. “This is primarily
a blue-collar university.”

And so the wedding parties have
ranged from having no attendants
to" nearly 30. The average,-
Bluestone said, is three or four per
side, although many have only one.

The number of guests also varies
greatly. “We’ve had one with no
guests,” Bluestone said. “But the
average is around 100.” The
Chapel - can accommodate 500
easily, Beukema said, and more if
the balcony is opened completely.

Neither noticed a correlation
between the. size of the wedding
and its formality. Most ceremonies
are formal, they agreed; meaning
the bride wears a long gown and
the groom sports a rented suit.
Military and ultraformal weddings
have been held in the Chapel"
occasionally. 1 «

universities. Some Senate mem-
bers have seen this attempted
interference as an effort toward
legislative control over state-relat-
ed universities.

Brown, however. does not share
that view.

“Moves like the Shane Amend-
ment are an attempt to recognize
that as'the universities become
more financed by public _funds,
they should have some ~account-
ability. _

“There is an interest in knowing
that the money is spent well,"
Brown said, “but I don't think
there's an interest among the
‘legislators to control or direct Pitt.

The German department is
coordinating a special series of
courses and extracurricular activi-

and socio-political history of
“Weimar Germany, From Bis-

the winter term.

The program will be centered
around a specially structured core
‘course (German. 184)i on the
Weimar Republic, an era of
German history that, though it
ended only in 1933, already has

IIIIIIIIIIIII

 Another Western

BY M. C. PILECKI

, Katherine Hepburn fans will go -
' to any lengths to see the screen’s
greatest actress in action, even if it
" means watching a John Wayne

movie.

Rooster Cogburn doesn’t have
much else to recommendit besides
the chance to see Hepburn make an
all-too-rare ﬁlm appearance. One
merely wonders why there was
nothing better than this.

The plot is rather flimsy-—what
there is of one. It seems to be a
True Grit meets The‘ African
Queen. Wayne plays the title role
(whose character previously won
him an Oscar). a violent lawman

_ who ‘again ﬁnds himself helping a

woman avenge her father’s death.

Only this time around, guess
who's the woman? Yep, it’s Katy,
unmarried missionary who ﬁnds
herself with less than genteel
company as she goes on a mission
that (includes explosives and

. shooting the rapids. ‘

This all somehow sounds very
familiar.

The sparkling dialogue includes
such "lines as, “This here is no
place for a woman,” and “That’s
the most dadburned woman I ever
met.” Terriﬁc, huh? Sounds just
like one of Wayne's early Republic
ﬂicks.

So’s the plot, which vaguely had
something to do with a band of

nasties who steal a shipment of
nitroglycerin to blow up and rob a
bank. Or something like that. One
is never really sure these great
unwashed characters are doing
besides grunting a lot, looking
mean, and cursing the name of
Cogburn. .

Not that the film is really all that
bad. Actually, it’s kind of fun in
the same sense that those horribly
made Saturday matinee movies
were (the ones you went to as kids).

Even then, you could tell how '

shoddy they were, but since the
movies didn’t take themselves
seriously, neither did the audience,
and everybody had a good time.
Hepburn spends most of the
movie mugging her way through a
very skimpy role. She has none of
the ﬁre of her Queen role, best

evidenced by comparing the two
different characters’ reactions to ‘

the rapids: Queen’s is exhiliara-
ted, while Cogburn’s is frightened.

But there's no need to get very
deep with this flick. It’s just a light
piece of froth featuring gorgeous
scenery and a lively repartee
between Hepburn and Wayne that
is only occasionally interruped by
the plot. There are a few good
comback lines here, so it’s not a
complete waste.

And, of course, getting a chance
to watch Katherine Hepburn is
always a good way to use one’s_
time. '

New LP Disappointment

BY JAMES SPARK

This long-awaited album, the
first from Pink Floyd since Dark
Side of the Moon, introduces a new

phase of Pink Floyd music with-

some»innovations that are not all
good.

1.First a‘ word about the cover.
‘Many of us uninformed folks gazed
long and hard at it wondering why
the mysterious dark blue cello-,
phane covered what was under-
neath. Undoubtedly it’s a full-color
glossy picture of the rest of ‘the
comely young maid who graces the
cover of A Nice , Pair, right?
Wrong. I won’t ruin the surprise
for you, but it’s certainlya' burning
issue. »

The best out of the whole album '

is “Wish You Were Here,” which
is original in the Floyd sense of the
word, burning guitar and heart-
rending lyrics. A cut that has
received the most airplay, “Shine

On You Crazy Diamond,” is
divided into nine parts, and covers
a good portion of both sides of the
album. This is also an excellent
cut, at least the ﬁrst part, which
sounds a bit like something off

Dark Side of the Moon. ' - '

But much of the material is weak
in comparison with earlier works.
Musically, not performances are as
great as usual. The main weakness

4 lies in the concepts of the material.

One big difference though, is the
use of violins in the background
instead of the traditional synthes-
izers. With one fell swoop, Floyd
has managed to thoroughly mess
up some of the cuts with those
sickening violins. ’

All in all, Wish You Were Here is
slightly disappointing. Unlike Dark
Side of the Moon, it does not signal
a tremendous change in direction,
but it deﬁnitely has its brilliant
spots.

  Choir ‘Tries’ Early Sonnets

BY PAMELA EUSI

The setting was unique, the
atmosphere calm. I walked inside
the chapel, blocking out the
unusual warmth of a ‘ November
day. A few minutes later, the

‘group stepped into view and lifted .

its frail voice in angelic song; well,
almost angelic song. ,

The setting was Heinz Chapel
and the group was the Heinz
Chapel Choir, directed by Marjorie
Kleiman. The concert was'made
up entirely of Petrarchan sonnets.
What are Petrarchan sonnets?
Good point. For a minute
yesterday, Ithought Kleiman chose
those -selections just so people
would come out of curiosity’s sake

alone to ﬁnd out exactly what a:

Petrarchan sonnet is.

Francesco Petrarca, well-known
as Petrarch, was essentially a
poet-humanist from the 14th-Cen-
turn Italy. He wrote over 400 _love
poems to Laura, a woman he
adored.

Petrarch got all his poems
together in one encyclopedia-size
collection. It was for these poems
that the music for yesterday’s
concertwas composed. It seems
that over the “years since 14th-
centurycomposers took a liking to
the Petrarch material and when
they didn’t have anything better to
do, they took a crack at setting

-those glorious verses to music.

Don’t ask me why, I don’t know if
all that effort was worth it.

The poems are lovely and classic
literature, but it seems to me that
they were yesterday’s ancestor to
today’s pop lyrics. I guess back in
the.cczrlﬁoirpmantip_B99aissance

‘Italy, a man was not a man if he
didn’t prove it to his lady love
through the poetic verse.

The Choir took a stab at the
sonnets and it must go down on the
record as a good try. Over-all the
balance of the Choir was a little
weak. The tone was ﬁne until the
sonnets broke up into a number of
parts. Then everything became
nebulous.

Because the group is particularly
small this year, Kleiman should
stick to projecting the good

qualities of the individual sections_

or of the group as a whole. The
director of a large “Mormon
Tabernacle Choir” doesn’t have to
concern himself with this matter.
‘Kleiman should.

The Choir can project volume
when necessary, but then another
problem becomes evident. Enun-
ciation. _If someone was writing a
how-to book on choral singing,

_ enunciation should be on page one.

_It’s not that the Choir doesn’t
enunciate. It does, but only in an
individual sense. As a whole, the

group needs a lot of work in this
area. Also words were literally
swallowed in most of the pieces.
This ties in with the enunciation
problem—you can’t enunciate un-
less you open your mouth. Most of
the members’ mouthes didn’t have
space enough to let a ﬂy in.

As a whole, the Renaissance)

sonnets were fairly interesting as
medieval ‘tones and choral frills
prevailed. The continuity of the
pieces was kept in balance by
Kleiman, and her conducting
essentially stuck to the basics.
Several of the works contained
tempo pickups or key changes and
here the real talent of the Choir was
displayed. Some really good parts
contained dialogue between the
male and the female sections of the

Choir; others displayed the range‘

of the sopranos or more strength in
one section compared with the
others. A

In one especially memorable
work, the ﬁrst sopranos started off
on the high notes and were

supposed to stay high. But they I

didn’t. They began sharp and went
down the scale by slight digres-
sions until they were noticibly ﬂat.
Meanwhile the rest of the choir was
having a tough time with individual
parts. Some of the problems with
this piece had their origins in the

. successive breaking up into parts of

the musical phrases. What
resulted was a mixed-up jumble of
choir members looking like they
had lost their places and sounding
like a bunch of very ﬂat sopranos.
No one can say they didn’t try.

Then the choir reached the
20th-Century music portion of the
program. The “0cchi miei lassi”
by Wilhelm Killmayer was'a good
selection, but the soloist should
have been louder or the choir
should have been toned down.

“Omaggio a Petrarca” was
written by Wayne Slawson, who
just happens to be the chairman of
the music department at Pitt. It
contained excerpts of the previous
works performed and really kept
the concert alive with the eerie
effects Slawson used in his modern
piece.

Humming, buzzing noises, spo-
ken words, dissonance, choral bits
and pieces and trills were some of
the techniques employed by
Slawson. You knew at a glance that
the choir enjoyed peforming this
piece and it couldn't help but affect
your reaction.

The last piece, “Canzon s’al
dolce loco” by Killmayer, was a
very good number to exit with,
having strong choral parts and
excellent contrasts in dynamics.

At Eng. Races

steeplechase is a type of race in
which horses are made to jump
over things like hedges and
creeks). Kelly Hughes, a steeple-
chase jockey, has lost his racing
license for winning a race he should
have lost. As it turns out, Hughes
and his employer, one Cranfield
(who also lost his license) have
been framed. «

The architect-of the frame-up is a
well—kept secret until the very end
of the book, but Francis does an
excellent job sustaining the sus-
pense while Hughes—who sets out
to unearth the reason for the
frame-up—-tracks down leads, one
after another.

There’s only one specious point
in the narrative: the manner with
which Hughes’ car is tampered,
causing a near-fatal accident. It’s
specious because ‘it's hard to
picture anyone crawling under a
car to doctor it while he's attending
a party—-and anyway, how many

people carry electric drills in their

tool kits_, anyway? _
Having tantalized you with that,
we’d like to add that Enquiry is
worth reading, if you want
something to take your mind off
work for a few hours. Unfortunate-
ly, Enquiry is not available at the
Book Center or at J ay’s Book Stall.

Nostalgic ‘OwI'i

BY TOM WASELESKI

The 1975 Owl, Pitt Yearbook Staff. 
~ 416 pp.

Nostalgia, that craze over 1930s‘,
big city elegance. That longing for
the top-hat virility and peacock chic
we like to believe- the men and
women of that time exhibited. That
imitation of macho, meaningless-

_ ness, and money worship at a time

when those who had it had it all.
That thrill of physical progress,
that aura of devil-may-care, that
doting life of comfort and conven-
ience. -

The 1975 Owl (all copies of which
already have been sold) artistically
captures ourtrendy infatuation for
things past. Unfortunately, the
book moves at times from

resembling nostalgia to restagingt in

quite ignorantly some of the’ social

excesses of the swing years.
Though it would be fashionable

for me to accuse Editor David

1 Sheluga of ideas .that certainly
. would draw heavy ﬁre from NOW, I

think it best for readers to decide
for themselves, lest this article
deteriorate into just another jump
on the unquestioning bandwagon.
First off, the book’s title page

‘H serves up a young woman dressed

in an embroidered gown and
picture hat, She stands alone in a
meadow, one hand resting on an
old stump, with a look on her face
like those‘ on women in ads
attempting to sell better orgasm or
some other unmarketable com-

modity. She’.s also rather
top-heavy and it looks very
deliberate. - A ‘

Whatpthe male-conceived stereo-
type of 18th-century womanhood
has to do with nostalgia is a
mystery. What is even more
uncanny is why this photo,
strategically placed on that all-
important ﬁrst page, is in effect
setting the tone for the rest of the
book.

The section that immediately
follows is the best in the book,
perhaps the best in any book at Pitt_
or elsewhere. Tracing the growth
of the University, “Another Open-
ing” is a myriad spewing of photos
showing the erection of the

less accept. _
There are photos of what was at
the corner of Fifth and Bouquet

before the Towers, whatsat on the _

acres that now hold Clapp, Langley

and Crawford Halls, what Pitts-’ "
burgh looked like before its attempt _r ‘ T. 5*

at urban renaissance.

The section is important because’
of its depiction of Pitt as one with‘
the city. Though it can be said the-
focus in on the typically materialist-
view of physical expansion, 1’ can.
think of no better visual_way to ,
show change than through geo- '
American cities being“

graphy.
what they are, and Pitt being a city
university the way Fifth Avenue is
a city high school, there is little that

remains the same, and Sheluga

conveys this feeling very well.

Next our title page young woman -
shows up again, this time with the
mascot (which has more "

Owl
stuffing?) to usher in, ironically
enough, the book’s worst section: a
series of color glossies wasted on a

imposing campus. buildings we‘ .
have come to know and more or , .

with Pitt or nostaliga, and the last
photo quite emphatically displays

of the ‘ ‘

editor’s intent.

The first section that deals with
the actual year reflects, deﬁnitely
unintentionally, the American pre-
occupation with the ritual of sports.
It’s a sports section, so what can
you say?

Under Campus Life is a page
devoted to what can be covered by
a Kampus Kaleidoscope Home-
coming T-shirt. A young woman is
wrapped in a fur coat; the second
pose has her coyly revealing bare
shoulders; the ﬁnal shot shows her
displaying her full front (alas!)
covered with a Homecoming
T-shirt.

A standout section is the
seven-pager done on Greek Week.

What dresses up some otherwise‘

commonplace photographs of
drunken men and women are the
drawings of Gable, Astaire, et al by
Randy Choura. The book’s cover is
done in a similar vein and deserves
at least passing remarks.

The mentality behind the various

1 unnecessary displays of women

could well be summed up in the
full-page photo of Editor Sheluga.
who has chosen to seat his
godfather self in a wicker chair
ﬂanked by four fawning females.
The photos of the rest of the staff
are done with similar hype; some
are genuinely well-choreographed,
others are sure to offend.
The senior section is easy on the
eyes with each photo framed in
ovals and not arranged like the
cubical matrix on the face of a
computer. A good idea in this
section was the use of personal
closeups of student leaders accom-
panied by their thoughts on Pitt.
The idea was turned into a sham,
though, since all the comments
were candy ﬂavored “...the past
four years have been the most
satisfying of my life...,” “...this is
what makes Pitt truly ‘Someplace
Special’...," “I am grateful to the
University,...,” etc.) and there was
no honest representation of student
opinion. All students obviously are
not so pleased with higher

learning, and for the yearbook to
give that impression by not seeking
a fair cross-section of commentar-
ies is deliberately deceiving.

One thing that can be said about
the '75 Owl in sum. though, is it
has tried not to be a boring
yearbook. For this objective they
should receive some credit.
However, in striving for excitement
and humor, the staff has exhibited
a social consciousness as old and
outdated as the theme they try to
capture.

In light of the entire production,
those busy at work on the ’76
edition will have lessons both good
and evil to keep in mind.

For Three Way AFC Tie ,

CINCINNATI (AP)——Safety rback
Mike Wagner choked off a late
Cincinnati rally with two intercep-
tions. returning one‘ 65 yards to set
up a touchdown as the Pittsburgh
Steelers knocked the Bengals from
the undefeated ranks with a 30-24
National Football League victory.-.
Sunday.

Cincinnati, trailing 23-3 entering
the final quarter, had" closed to
within 23-l7'with seven minutes
left, but Wagner’s interceptions
preserved the Steeler victory,
throwing the AFC Central Division
i'nto a ﬁrst-place tie.

Quarterback Terry Bradshaw
propelled the Steelers to the
victory, ﬁring touchdown passes of
37 and 25 yards to wide receiver
Lynn Swarm while fullback Franco
Harris was amassing his first
100-yard rushing day of the season.

The loss was Cincinnati's ﬁrst in
seven games and left both clubs
with identical 6-1 records..

Cincinnati quarterback Ken An-
derson, after a dismal ﬁrst half,

keyed the aroused comback,.hitting.

his favorite target, Isaac Curtis,
with long strikes to put the Bengals
in scoring position.

He hit Charlie Joiner with. a
34-yard scoring pass for Cincin-
nati’s ﬁrst touchdown moments
into the last quarter and marched
the Bengals 80 yards for the second
touchdown,
three-yard screen‘ pass to Essex
Johnson. . ‘

After Wagner’s second intercep-
tion, which set up a one-yard
touchdown plunge by Bradshaw,
the Bengals marched upﬁeld and
scored in the final seconds on a

_22-yard Anderson pass to Chip

Myers.
Anderson completed 18 of 34

,0 passes for 331 yards in thelosing

cause. . . _p

Harris rushed 157 yards in -27
attempts to lead all rushers and
crack the 100-yard mark for the
14th time in his career. Bradshaw,

capping it‘ with a»

who threw a 25-yard touchdown
pass to Swann to make it 17-3 early
in the second half, was 13 for 24 for
164 yards. He marched the
Steelers 70 yards in the third
quarter to make it 23-3 on Rocky
Bleier's three-yard run.

The game opened on an ominous
note for Cincinnati, with Anderson
the victim of a crunching blow by
Dwight White on the ﬁrst play.

. ‘Anderson, shaken and dazed,

. was removed from the game, but

returned on the next series after
Cincinnati blunted Pittsburgh’s
first scoring threat. 9
Bernard Jackson intercepted a
Bradshaw pass in the endzone after
the Steelers marched to the
Cincinnati 32. It was only the
second interception off Bradshaw

-this year. He had ‘thrown 117

passes, including 85 in a row
without an interception.
Anderson directed the Bengals
downﬁeld with completions of 20,
24 and 20 yards, setting -up a
23-yard ﬁeld goal by Dave Green
with ﬁve minutes left in the
quarter. -. '
The Steelers came alive behind
ground-gulping runs by Harris to

tie the score with seven minutes .
left in the second qu_arter. Harris,

galloped for 53 yards during the
drive to Cincinnati's 25-yard line,

where Roy Gerela kicked a 42-yard
field goal, his longest of the year. _

The Steelers moved the‘ ball
easily during the first half,
outgaining Cincinnati 124-18 on the
ground, but were stymied by two
pass interceptions and two fum-
bles. '

Anderson never got untracked in
the first half, hitting only ﬁve of 18
passes and the Cincinnati offense

SYRACUSE, NY—On a dark,
rainy afternoon in ancient Archbold
Stadium, the Pitt Panthers demon-
strated the maturity and poise they
were reported to hav.e to the 20,000
Syracuse partisans, as they
crushed the Orangemen, 38-0.

The victory, a must win after the
disappointing defeat suffered ' by
Pitt-last week against Navy, raised
the Panthers’ record to 6-2, while
dropping the downhearted ‘yet
vastly improving Orange to 4-4.

Syracuse came out spirited after
its upset of Boston College a week
ago. This was in contrast to the
Panthers, who were intent, deter-
mined, almost business-like.

"We had ajob to’ do today,” said
Head Coach Johnny Majors. “I am
delightfully pleased with the angry

, poise we showed out there. It was

a game we had to win, we went out
in a business-like fashion, and did

what we came up here to do. This-

was by far our biggest win of the
season.”

Standout performances for the
Panthers were almost‘ too numer-
ous to mention. Sophomore Matt"
Cavanaugh, starting his ﬁrst
varsity game, played with the poise
of a senior. He directed the Pitt.
offense as smoothly as it has been
run all- season, and operated the

difﬁcult veer as if he had been

running it all his life.

Cavanaugh started out slowly,
badly overthrowing Gordon Jones
on his ﬁrst passing attempt. His
second toss was. set up by a
beautiful fake on the fullback dive

Coach Grgurich

  -Gutsy

BY YAIER LEHRER

Almost every basketball team
has that gutsy kid who, although he
may not be of star potential, has
enough grit and determination to
make up for his lack of skill. Pitt’s
tournament teams of 1963 and 1964
had a player like that. His name

’ was Tim Grgurich.

Grgurich starred on those teams,
serving as the playmaker who
usually would feed the ball to either
Calvin Sheffields or Brian Gener-
alovich, sixth and seventh on Pitt’s
all-time scoring list, respectively.

. “Tim was one of those players
who was constantly working hard,”
said then Head Coach Bob Tim-
mons. “He worked so hard he
forced the other guys to work hard,
too. Ithink this attitude is reflected
in his coaching as well.” I

“Some guys are super players
and have to work only a little,”

Grgurich said, “but ‘I had to keep" ,

going all -the time. If I hadn’t
worked, I would never have
played.”

Even if playing basketball does
not come naturally to Grgurich, his
love for the game and his
involvement make up for it.

“Basketball was a .12-month
thing for me," Pitt’s rookie head
coach said. “It is a game in which I
was and am totally involved.”

Grgurich’s involvement in Pitts- .

burgh basketball stretches over
many years. He played basketball
at Central Catholic High, School,
played on the Pitt team, coached as
a graduate assistant to Timmons,
coached full-time under Timmons,
and coached under Buzz Ridl, until

  

/ .

"Mélnday,::Novemb‘erv.'3;n1.975—I‘l‘HB 

play, when he found tight end Jim
Corbett wide open over the middle.
That pass was good for 37-yards
and. set up Pitt’s ﬁrst score, a
10-yard romp by Elliott Walker.
The drive covered 65 yards in six
plays. 7

Meanwhile, Syracuse was having
a helluva time trying to figure out
which end was "up. After the
ensuing kickoff was returned to the
Syracuse 20, Orange quarterback
Bob Mitch decided to go to the air.
On ﬁrst and 10, his pass over the
middle was deﬂected by safety
Dennis Moorhead, and‘ fell into the
hands of defensive back Leroy
Felder, who returned the ball to the
18-yard line.

Pitt was on the move again.
Unfortunately, as Walker lashed
toward the end zone, the ball
popped out of his arms and was
recovered by Syracuse’s Keith
Moody despite a diving effortby
Corbett to grab the pigskin.

This setback only served to delay
the inevitable, for the Panthers
were not to be denied this day.

After another Syracuse drive was
thwarted deep in its own territory,
Larry King booted a high spiraling
punt to the Pitt 43. Enter freshman
sensation Jones. The flashy wide
receiver, who is also one of the
'nation’s leaders in punt returns,
corraled the ball, took to the
sidelines and ﬂew 48 yards to the
Syracuse 14, where King comple-
ted his duties by making a
touchdown-"saving tackle.

After two runs up the middle to
the eight, Cavanaugh faked with
the fullback dive, and his pass
found Corbett all alone in the end
zone for Pitt’s second score of the
half. Carson Long, who hasn't
missed a point after touchdown in
his last 54 attempts, set the score at
14-0.

On_Pitt’s next offensive series,
that moment all of Archbold
Stadium was dreading was about to
‘arrive. With a third down and
three at the Pitt 27, Cavanaugh.
made a perfect pitch to number 33,

and Tony Dorsett was off on _a I

73-yard touchdown scurry. It was

coach following Ridl’s retirement.

As a Pitt junior varsity. coach,
Grgurich compiled a record of
90-33, and one year led the team to
a 13-5 record with only two
scholarship players.

“I love working with these
kids,” Grgurich said. “The types
‘of players you get nowadays are so
_much better than we were when I
played at Pitt 10 years ago.”

A Panther Swimmers:

   Close But No Cigar  

BY JAN MATTHEWS

It was close, but no cigar for
the four Pitt swimmers in the
recently concluded Pan-American
Games in Mexico City.

Carlos -Santiago, Orlando
Catinchi, Angela Lopez and Nila de
Jesus represented their native
Puerto Rico at the Games, but the
best ﬁnish among them was fourth.

The Puerto Rican 4x100 relay
team, including Santiago, managed
fourth place, only one second
behind the bronze medal winners.
Santiago’s 4x200 relay team

ﬁnished sixth.

Hopes of individual honors for
Santiago were shattered before he
hit the water. His coaches failed to-
register" him for the 100-and
200-meter backstroke, his best
event. <

Catinchi was the best individual
performer, placing ﬁfth ' in the
individual medley. ‘In the 200-and
100-meter breaststroke, he reached

   

respectively.

the‘-" , ninth, and tenth, spots}

The women did not fair so well,

Though Lopez made the ﬁnals of-8 - 

the 200-meter breaststroke, she

could manage only an alternate"_:;,.:':',

position in the 100-meter breast.

Things were even worse for ‘de 
Jesus. She failed to ‘make the ﬁnals."  
in either the 100-meter freestyle or _

the 200-meter. breaststroke. ‘

One of the major problems facing  
the swimmers was the thin air of,.;{,

Mexico City.
“The altitude was a real
problem,” Catinchi said. “We

were unable to train properly for: 

this.”

The Americans, on the other  

hand, had a chance to practice

under the unfavorable conditions, ‘ 
and it_ paid off. The Yanks swept 

away with 27 of 29 gold medals.
‘But, as in all sporting cliches,

winning wasn’t everything to the

Pitt swimmers. ' ‘

‘ ‘It was exciting just to represent Vi

my country,” Lopez said, ‘-‘and. to
meet the great athletes from all

over. the Western Hemisphere." 4 ”

Time was running out in the
fourth quarter, and the ﬁreworks
seemed to be about over. But there
was one more ﬂash.

Pitt’s next offensive series was a
brilliant 80-yard drive, in one play.

Starting at its own 20, Pitt had one .

more shot for the riddled Syracuse
defense. Cavanaugh faded back,
and found punt returner and
part-time wide receiver Jones
streaking down the sideline. The

picture-perfect pass, which went‘

more than 50 yards in the air,
sailed just over Jones’ head and

conversation, time ran out on the.

"Cats Squeeze Orangemen

“The defense was really cranked
up this week,” Majors said after
“The pass rush was
excellent. We had good pursuit,
good gang tackling. I can’t begin
to single anyone out. (Al) Romano,
Parrish, Jury, Jeff Delany, where‘
would I start?”

Linebacker Arnie Weatherington
summed things up by saying,' “I
feel this was our best game and our
biggest win. We had to overcome
adversity, and I knew this was the
kind of team that could bounce
back. We sure did, didn’t we?”

Offensively, the Panthers were
devastating, scoring almost at will.

"Dorsett rambled for 158 yards on 28 *

carries, giving him that treasured
goal of 1,000-plus yards for the
third time. “I’m glad I had a good
game at such a nice time, as far as
our season goes,” Dorsett said.
“This put me over 1,000 yards, a
goal V I set for myself at the
beginning of the season.

“But it was a team effort and a
team victory. I’m pleased with my
own accomplishments, but I want
to see us keep winning. lthink
we’re on the right track now.”

Freshman Matt Carroll, starting
his ﬁrst varsity game at left guard,
and the rest of the offensive line,
John Hanhauser, John Pelusi, Tom
Brozozo and Joe Stone, received a
lot of praise from Cavanaugh their

so did Dorsett and Walker, because

those guys (thepoffensive line) did a_
.fantastic jo ,” Cavanaugh said.

“We had to establish a running
game tackle to tackle, and after we
got that going, it was easy for me to
throw the ball.” V

Cavanaugh was six of nine
passing, for 167 yards and three
touchdowns. Mitch, his Syracuse
counterpart, was six of 20, for 95
yards. He was intercepted twice.’

It was a dark, rainy afternoon in
ancient Archbold Stadium, but as it
is written, it is always darkest
before the dawn. '

Basketbal|Everything  

To New Head Coach

(Continued from Page,13)

somewhere, come back to Pitt for a
coaches’ meeting, go to practice,

go visiting again (sometimes to.

clinics) and ﬁnally get home at
midnight.

This goes on for seven days a
week, non-stop. Where there’s a
will, there’s a way.

The new head coach will have to
have plenty of will; hesuffered two
major disappointments even before

his coaching debut. First was the

signing of Mel Bennett by the
Virginia Squires, and the second is
the ineligibility of Kelvin Smith.
“You know, Billy Knight had the
same sort of problem " as Kelvin
Smith did when he came here,”
said the undaunted Grgurich, “and
what Billy did for us was just get us
a million dollars worth of publicity
in his senior year, not to mention
his athletic accomplishments.”
But alas and alack, Knight is no
longer with us and Grgurich has to

‘get by without two potentially

strong rebounders in Bennett and
the 6-11 Smith. He also must deal
with the plethora of minor injuries
and illnesses.

Pitt will have to play tough,
gutsy basketball to overcome the
monster schedule that awaits it,
much like the basketball its coach
played 10 years ago. '

“If they play like I did, then we’ll
never score any points,” Grgurich
said with a smile. “We’ll just have
to go on playing like we have for
the past couple of years. Constant
running and tough defense will be
the key.” _

I don_’t plan to make any
wholesale changes-. A lot of these
kids have already been to two
major tournaments in as many
years._There"s_no reason to start

making drastic changes.”

The only great change that could
effect this season would be a new
coach. Grgurich’s benchside man-
ner is something to behold. It is a
rare occasion when one can catch
him sitting down. His intensity,
enthusiasm and general attitude
hopefully will be contagious.’

“I don’t think my attitude is

 

CTIM GRGURICH

going to/change these kids
around,” Grgurich said. “When

we look for these kids, enthusiasm
is one of the things we look for,
after talent, of course. Enthusiasm
comes. from the people you
recruit.” 0

“There are three things that I
want from a player.‘ First is that he
be an athlete, second that he be a
student, and third and just as
important that he be an individual.
A quality player must also be a
quality individual.”

With a quality ’ individual in
Grgurich, it appears the players
have a good model, and perhaps

_most important, a good coach.

  Netters Warming Up?  

BY TOM HALL
Associate Sports Editor

With the autumn chill comes...
tennis? So it goes for the Pitt
tennis team, which currently is_
involved in a series of exhibition
matches in preparation for the start
of tennis season this spring. I

First-year Head Coach George

‘Dieffenback is, well, enthusiastic.

And he should be. In exhibition‘
matches this'year, his team has
compiled a 3-0 record with wins
over West Liberty College, Du-
quesne and (last Saturday) Alle-
gheny Community College (ACC).

Pitt beat ACC, 5-4, on Saturday.

“The ACC match was really
close. We got a big win in our ﬁrst
doubles match when Howie.Stern
and Mike Habbel won a come-from
-behind 0-6, 7-5, 7-5 victory,”
Dieffenbach said.

What is more impressive is the
fact the Panthers are playing
without the services of four of their
top six players. 1

The players to watch in the

‘upcoming weeks are Habbel and

Joe Sakalik, a freshman from
Central Catholic High School.
“The Athletic Department has
given us a lot of support thus far,”
Dieffenbach said. “The players
are enthusiastic, practice hard, and

.}1're really conditioning themselves

for the upcoming season. /

“We have a lot of spirit, plenty
of teamwork, and enough conﬁ-
dence in our talents to hope that we
can carry on the tradition of
winning tennis here at Pitt.”

The combined men’s and .
women’s teams play a World Team
Tennis format match and have a 2-0
record in the exhibition season.

Saturday’s ACC contest was
made up of six singles matches and
three doubles. Habbel, Howie

  Harriers Finish Third  

At Central Collegiates   i

BY RALPH’ SPARKLE

The Pitt cross-country team had
a ﬁne showing at the Central
Collegiate Championships at State
College last Saturday with a strong
third-place ﬁnish.

Michigan, ranked third -in the
East, won the team title over 13
teams with 45 points to Penn
State's 50, Pitt/’s 97, and defending
champion Eastern Michigan's 107.
Kent State was ﬁfth with 122
points,

Defending champ Paul Stemmer
of Penn State won again in 25:05 on
the fast 5.2-mile course.

Head Coach Mike Agostinella
commented, “This was the sixth
step in our building process. The
freshmen were a little hesitant
about going out fast but everyone
ﬁnished ‘strong. Icouldn’t ask for a
better opening appearance in our
conference. ,

“Eastern Michigan was defend-

I ing champion and ranked high

nationally, and we knocked them
off. Although everyone ran well,
Bob Lee ran a super race and junior

Terry Wile ran the best he has all '

season.” .

Nick Martin and Mel Boyd went
out with the leaders early and were
close all the way. Dave McDonald,
hampered by leg cramps, camein
25th, displacing two Eastern
Michigan runners and helping Pitt
ﬁnish third. I '

Freshmen Lee and Ron Wirick

started slowly and-had to work their _ 9

way up through the pack.

This Friday the Pitt Harriers will
have a second chance to knock off
seventh-ranked Penn State. The
Harriers were at a disadvantage at
PSU on a new course with a shorter
distance. When Penn State

runners come to Schenley Park, ,

they will have to run hard to beat
the Harriers.
