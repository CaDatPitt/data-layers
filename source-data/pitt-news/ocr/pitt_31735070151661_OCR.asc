There’s nothing new about the problems ‘novelty’ IDs pose

Brett Sholtis
Staﬁ” Wrz'ter

For authorities, it’s a {constant ﬁght to
stay ahead of the counterfeiters.

Fake driver’s licenses and other iden-
tiﬁcation cards have been around since
bars started carding people. But in re-
cent years, counterfeiters with access
tothe same technology used to make
legitimate IDs are generating fake IDs
so sophisticated that they bypass many
of the established deterrents.

According to Rick Goodling, a Penn-
sylvania State Police corporal with the
Bureau of Liquor Control Enforcement,
these online companies have changed the
way law enforcement combats fake IDs.

“[Until recently], most fake IDs were
made by college kids and were much
easier to recognize,” Goodling said.
Sold online as “novelty IDs,” the most
sophisticated fake IDs cost between

, $100 and $200. These so-called novelty

IDs, embedded with scan-strip data and
holograms, leave bartenders and store
clerks struggling to identify them and

often relying on old-fashioned meth-
ods to keep underage customers out of
their establishments. Goodling said that
for the past four years, Liquor Control
Enforcement has trained other law en-
forcement agencies to help them spot
such bogus cards.

For Ryan Woldt, the general manager
of Pizza Sola, there is no replacement for
an experienced bartender.

“The new fake IDs are so advanced
that they may fake the scanner or fake
the holograms,” said Woldt, referring to
the ability of these cards to trick the ma-
chines present in many bars and alcohol
retailers. Some of these machines read
the authentication strip on the back of a
Pennsylvania ID, and others shine a light
on the card, revealing any holograms
embedded within it.

Woldt noted that the scanners and
hologram machines might give bartend-
ers a false sense of security, and insisted
that bartenders still have to rely on their
judgment. He claimed that he is usually
able to determine a fake by examining
the card rather than running it through

a machine.

According to Woldt, Pizza Sola is
most likely to see a fake ID during the
very beginning or very end of a semester.

“We take it upon ourselves to go above
and beyond,” Woldt said. “My general

rule is, even when it’s obvious [that
someone is of legal age], we go ahead
and check. the ID.”

Woldt cited his business’ reputation
as one reason to enforce the law, stating

Students search for meal options to fitreligious guidelines

Sabrina Romano

Staff Wrz'ter
Michael» Fingerman said that when
he began his freshman year at Pitt,
he “thought it was interesting that a
large school didn’t have large [dining]
options.” I

NowlFingerman‘, president of Hil-
lel, a campus organization for Jewish
students, ﬁnds it “a little unfortunate
that they [Sodexo] don’t have kosher
options,” and said that he did not keep
kosher during freshman year because
of it.

However, Pitt spokesman John Fe-
dele said that the University does make
accommodations forjewish students to
eat on campus.

In order to keep kosher, practitio-
ners of the Jewish faith must eat dairy
products and meat separately. Kosher

food has to be prepared in a kitchen
where only kosher food is prepared.
It also requires a mashgiach, which is
a kosher supervisor, to make sure the
food is cooked properly. 7
Fedele said in an email that students
can preorder kosher meals with their
dining passes and that kosher food is

sold at the Quick Zone convenience

store located in Litchﬁeld Towers.

Hillel and the Muslim Student As-
sociation have expressedvdifferent at-
titudes toward how Sodexo accommo-
dates students’ religious dietary needs.

Fingerman, who is currently a junior
and majors in economics and urban
studies, said that he didn’t know pre-
ordering kosher meals was an option
at Pitt except during Passover. For the
holiday, students can preorder meals
that cost one market swipe.

Fedele said that Pitt’s dining services
wants to make more students aware that
they have this option.

“We will work with Mr. Fingerman
and others to enhance our marketing ef-
forts to communicate the pre—ordering
of Kosher meals,” Fedele wrote in an
email on behalf of Sodexo.

Fingerman said that the kosher op-
tions at Quick Zone are often cold—cut
sandwiches and are not available on a
regular basis, and he personally thinks
the sandwiches are unappetizing. To
remedy this, Fingerman wants Sodexo
to implement a plan similar to the one
at Carnegie Mellon University, where
kosher food is prepared off campus.

“CMU sells kosher chicken and
falafel prepared at Congregation Beth
Shalom. Students can purchase that
as part of their meal plan. Hot food

is shipped over multiple times a day
and kept warm in a different section,”
Fingerman said. '

Fedele said that the University is cur-
rently looking into the necessary steps
to provide kosher options.

“We are working with a kosher ven-
dor to determine what requirements are
necessary to provide hot food,” Fedele
wrote in an email. “Once that is de-
termined, modification to the facility
would need to be completed.”

Fedele said that space constraints
have made it difficult to provide a ko-
sher section in the-William Pitt Union.

“A kosher kitchen would benefit
Muslim students, too, because they can
eat the meat we eat,” Fingerman said.

Placement of dorms may T make the diffrene betwen ﬁt fa

Harrison Kaminsky
Social Media Editor

Incoming freshmen are often teased by rela- ’
tives to beware getting fat during their ﬁrst

year at Pitt. . I

But there’s certainly some truth to the rela-
tives’ endless warnings against the freshman
15. I '

According to a2o11 study published inthe .

Journal of Adolescent Health, the college ex-
perience — consisting oflate-night, studying,
excessive boozing and making meals without

parents —- might not be the sole factor in the ‘ I 

common weight gain among many ﬁrst-year
students. Rather, the distance between fresh-
men dorms to campus cafeterias and exercise
facilities could be the culprit.

The streets of Oakland, where most fresh-
men spend their ﬁrst two semesters at Pitt,
are packed with fast food restaurants, frozen
yogurt shops and burrito bars. Additionally,
students are able to eat at on-campus dining
halls with a seemingly endless number of meal
swipes and dining dollars.

The 2010 study examined the eating and
exercise habits of 144 male and 244 female
freshmen from the University of Marquette,
the University of Michigan and the Univer-
sity of Wisconsin—Milwaukee. It concluded
that students’ “physical environments” af-
fect their “vveight changes and weight-related
behaviors.”

The results claimed that students living in
dormitories closer to dining halls gained sig-
niﬁcantly more weight on average and showed
more dangerous dieting habits in comparison
to students who were not assigned to dormi-

that, once an establishment receives a
reputation for serving underage drink-
ers, then the problem only gets worse.
Liability is another big issue, said
Woldt, who mentioned the dram shop
law, a state law in Pennsylvania and
many other states that can hold an estab-

V lishment accountable if it serves alcohol

to someone who goes on to cause injury
or death to a third party. I

way’s Cafe for 11 years. According to
her, some of the newer fake IDs can be

tories close to dining facilities.

The study showed that students assigned
to dormitories close to a?‘campus gym exer-
cised moreﬁequently onmaverage and, there-
fore, gained less weight.  '

A The results reported  women who lived
closerto an on-campus cafeteﬁa weighed al-
mosttwo pounds morethanwomenwho lived

and exercised an averagéiof 1 1/2 times less

on—campus gym. I . ‘ ’

pus cafeterias consumed 22 percent more

 meals and 38 percent more snacks than men."

who lived further from cafeterias.

Female students living closer to a campus
gym exercised 54 percent more frequently
than females living off campus, and female
students who lived closer to the center of
campus exercised 97 percent less. ' S

Kandice Kapinos, a professor at the Uni-
versity of Michigan and lead author of the
study, said that additional factors, including
genetics and social environment, inﬂuence
weight gain. “We were not even expecting
the physical environment effects to be close
to ﬁve pounds,” she said.

Students on Pitt’s campus can easily relate
to the ﬁndings of the study because many
college atmospheres are similar in nature.

Dylan Pollock, aﬁrst-year engineering stu-
dent at Pitt, said he understood that gaining
the freshman 15 isn’tan all-out death sentence
for a student’s health. Pollock said that helost
weight since arriving at Pitt.

Pollock joined Pitt’s club wrestling team
at the beginning of the fall semester and ex-

pretty difﬁcult to detect. Her strategy
at Hemingway’s is to hire intelligent,
alert doormen.

“The doormen touch so many IDs that
they can just tell [when one is fake],”
said Keenan.

Keenan noted that in addition to
new, high-tech fakes, some underage
drinkers still use the old technique of
acquiring a duplicate ID from an older
sibling or friend. In that case, the scan
and swipe systems are useless since the
problem is not that the ID is fraudulent,
but rather, that it’s in the hands of the
wrong person. Having dealt with this is-
sue for years, Keenan’s approach is to ask
for a second form of ID when in doubt.

The Oakland Market and Bakery open

ercises regularly. But he said he understands
that it can be risky for students to lose their
grasp of a proper diet and their ability to pay
attention to daily eating habits.

“I’m pretty conscious of my swipes and
dining dollars, so I don’t eat whenl don’t have
to,” he said. ,

He added that he ate healthier at home
before coming to college, whereas, the lines
at Market Central sometimes drive him to less
nutritious options.

“Here, when I head to Market, it’s very
easy to just pick up a burger, a chicken patty
or mac and cheese,” Pollock said. “I usually

' “If your ID doesn’t swipe, you’re
deﬁnitely not getting in,” said Keenan,
although Hemingway’s does include un-
der-21 seating in the front dining area
until 10 p.m. She said that detection
systems are only the first line of de-
fense, and ultimately the doorman has
full reign to decide who is admitted.

According to Stacy Kriedeman, Penn-
sylvania Liquor Control Board director
of external affairs, employees of the
Pennsylvania Wine 8: Spirits Shop on At-
wood Street, checked 4,263 ID cards last
month. The store policy is to swipe the
card, visually inspect the ID and verify
that the information printed from the
swipe matches the information on the

would rather do that than have a salad or wait

in line for something that could be healthier.”
“Also, I always eat dessert here, which I

deﬁnitely didn’t do at home,” he added.

A Pollock lives in Litchﬁeld Tower A, located
directly above Market Central, and he agrees
with the study’s ﬁndings about the relation-
ship between dining hall proximity and po-
tential weight gain. He said that the ease of
travel to Market prods him to “grab a burger
and fries,” whereas, a location farther away
from campus would force himto eat healthier.

ing majority of IDs passed the check.
“We will ask for additional identifi-
cation [if the ID appears suspicious],”
said~Kriedeman, “If the clerk cannot
substantiate that the customer is 21'or
older, we will refuse the sale.”
Kriedeman said that store employees

_ isn’t perfect, alcohol retailers are often

the best—trained in detecting a fake. In
addition, he said that getting caught
with a fake could limit a student’s em-
ployment opportunities after gradua-
tion. Often, police will press charges,
not only for possession of fraudulent
identiﬁcation, but also for underage
drinking.

“The lawnstates that underage drink-
ing could get you a 90-day loss of li-
cense,” said. Goodling, as well as a one-
year loss of licences for-a second offense.

“So it is a deterrent.”
There is no legal burden on a bar to

. report a fake ID to law enforcement, but

according to Goodling, Liquor Control
Enforcement has developed relation-
ships with some bars-and distributors
to report a conﬁscated fake ID.

The control enforcement also runs
a program in which it sends 18- to
20-year-olds into bars, six-pack shops
and distributors in an attempt to pur-
chase alcohol with their own legitimate,‘

' albeit under-21 I_Ds. In 38 percent of

these attempts, the underage customer
was able to buy alcohol.

formation management major and the .

secretary of the Muslim Student Asso-
ciation, said that Islam has guidelines
for which foods are halal, or acceptable
for Muslims. . '

Similarly to Jewish dietary rules,
pork is forbidden under Islam. There
are two versions of dietary restriction.
Zabiha, thestricter version, focuses on

’ how the animal was slaughtered and

treated. Halal, which the majority of
Muslims follow, according to Memon,

is concerned with having the meat be
clean and not associated with pork.
“The two main things about Muslim
dietary restrictions are no pig and no
alcohol,” Memon said in an email.
Two years ago the Muslim Student
Association had halal food put in
Market Central, where it is offered at
lunchtime during the weekdays. When
the halal section is closed, Market has
made—to—order chicken patties and
hamburgers. The Perch does offer halal
food, though Fedele noted that those
meals are prepared upon request.
Memon said there have been at-
tempts to offer more halal options and

that canned halal meat was once avail-

. able at Quick Zone. Neither of these

efforts proved successful.

Memon said that the Muslim Stu-
dent Association continues to work
with Sodexo.

“We want them to have breakfast,
but they need the numbers [of people
who eat the food] ﬁrst,” Memon said.

Mashal Wakilpoor, a sophomore and
public relations chair for the Muslim
Student Association, said that another
way to ensure that one follows the ha-
lal guidelines is to follow a kosher or
vegetarian diet. She said that the effort
to maintain a diet according to Islam

is important.

’Wakilpoor said that a relaxed diet is
acceptable “as long as you have the right
intentions and don’t go out of your way
to eat the bad food.”

The Muslim Student Association
appreciates the halal food offered at
Market, according to Wakilpoor.

“It is very commendable that they
are "going out of their way to have halal
options,” she said.

, Fingerman said he appreciates any

H improvement Sodexo makes that caters

towardjewish students’ dietary needs.
“Baby steps are fine. Any improve-
ment is an improvement,” he said. I

“The effottlessness of it is really what gets
you in the end,” he said. “If it was more of a
walk to Market, I wouldn’t be as tempted to

. go there.”

Recent University construction projects
also add to the conversation regarding the
treatment of health issues on campus.

This past semester, the University added
Towers Treats, an ice creamand dessert
booth, to Market Central. The booth offers
sweet options including pies, puddings, cook-
ies, Rice Krispies Treats and soft—serve ice
cream and toppings.

The University also added the Oakland
Bakery and Market, a bakery in Amos Hall
that replaced a ﬁtness center.

The William Pitt Union is now home to
a new Taco Bell, relocated from its original
location next to Quick Zone. Quick Zone,the

convenience and food store located in the
basement of Litchﬁeld Towers adjacent to
Market Central, has been expanded to in-
clude the food options previously offered by
Market To—Go. ' ‘

Market To—Go, which closed this year,
was an area across from Quick Zone that sold
hot meals to students for the price of one
meal swipe.

“I personallywould like to see some more
healthy options at Market or at the Union,”
Pollock said. “Essentially, eating healthy at
Market is just eating a salad. There isn’t ex-
actly any altemative.”

Pitt was recently ranked the 12th healthi-
est college campus in the country by Greatlist.
com, an online source for health and ﬁtness
information.

Susan Fukushima, resident district man-
ager at Sodexo, the corporation that provides
Pitt’s dining services, ‘said that the lack of

- bakeries in Oakland sparked the Amos Hall

bakery project.

“There aren’t any bakeries in Oakland, so
in partnership with the University, Sodexo
developed the bakery concept to add more
variety for our students,” she said. “They now
can orderabirthday cake for afriend or grab
something on the way to class.”

Fukushima added that Market Central has
always served desserts, despite the construc-
tion of Towers Treats. A

“The new station allows us to better dis-
play our desserts and add the soft-serve ice
cream that students have been wanting,” she
said. “Like anything, moderation is key to
avoid any weight gain.”

Meg M. Mayer-Costa, a registered dieti-
cian at Pitt’s Wellness Center, believes that
the expansion of on- campus eateries will not
contribute to weight gain in students living
nearby.

“In the same vein, does having a gym in
the quad contribute to weight loss by its prox-

imity to students?” she asked in an email.
“Students can balance the foods they enjoy
and maintain a healthﬁil weight.”

Although the study does reportthata gym
located near students’ dormitories contrib-
utes to weight loss, Mayer—Costa said that it
should be up to students to make good choices
in deciding what they eat.

“I believe that Oakland’s food—ﬁlled atmo-
sphere is similar and quite indicative of the
world around us,” Mayer— Costa said. “This is
also the world students will eventually ﬁnd
themselves inhabiting.”

According to Mayer— Costa, making
healthy food choices is part of maturing.

“Food is culturally and socially inherent
to the fabric of our society, and the sooner
students learn how to take care of their indi-
vidual needs insuchanatmosphere, the easier
they will transition into their ﬁrst career op-
portunities when they leave the University,”
she said. I

As college students, we don’t
often encounter coffee in the

most favorable circumstances. a

After midnight, with hands
shakingtoo violently to ﬁnish
typing that take-home midterm

’ due in_less than 12 hours, coffee
can prove both a great ally and V

adeceitfulytr-ickster;

‘Either way, we rarely. treat
coffee with the respect it de-
serves.- The most fulfilling

._ coffee experiences demand at-
, tention, love and, most impor-

tantly, a proper setting. That
ideal setting is the local inde-
pendent coffee shop that caters
uniquely to its community. '
‘Oakland, however, desper-
ately lacks such an institution.
Ever since the tragic departure
of Kiva Han Coffee from Craig
Street last year, the neighbor-
hood’s caffeine landscape has
never recovered. Sure, you can’t
throw a stone without hitting
a Starbucks,~Crazy Mocha or
other chain cafe, but there’s
something distinctive about
an independent coffee house

that these others can’t easily
replicate. - h

I don’t intend to actually
throw stones at these cafes,
neither physical nor verbal.
They certainly perform a valu-
able service, energizing the
students, nurses, teachers and
businesspeople who make Oak-
land the dynamic neighborhood
that it is.“They even do it with
impressively satisfying brews
— depending on the shop, of
course.

But still, there is something
to be said for sipping a cup of
coffee made from grinds roast-

ed by the owner himself not
more than a few feet from the
cash register. Of returning on
any given morning to a familiar
barista who canrecommend an

appropriate blend to suit one’s .

taste.
These niceties enhance the

- coffee experience beyond a nec-

essary morning routine.

To get the experience, how-
ever, caffeine-curious stu-
dents must venture beyond
the bounds of Oakland to one
of the many worthy coffee shops
that populate the East End of
Pittsburgh. '

This distance between cam-

. pus and coffee shop can be both

a blessing and a curse. Although

” the prospect of riding a Port Au-

thority bus 10 minutes outside
of Oakland might prove too
daunting for a student addled
by lack of sleep at 9 a.m., it can
also bring one in contact with
demographics we don’t often
encounter in the neighborhood.
People over the age of 22, for
instance.

Coffee shops, as public spac-
es for working, socializing and
sipping, prove to be prime loca-
tions in which to reﬂect on the
communities that they serve.
Independent coffee shops,
which can vary more easily

T than franchises in their visual

and musical atmospheres to suit
the character of their clientele,
ideally fulﬁll this role.

Take, for instance, Lili Cafe
in Polish Hill — just a quick ride

on the 54C bus from campus.

Sipping espresso there on a Sun-
day morning, one can hear the
bells of the Polish-Catholic Im-
maculate Heart of Mary Church
calling much of its congregation

preciating coffee: Setting is eve

— an eclectic blend of tattooed

ibohemians and young families

— to worship. With advertise-
ments for local music groups
and artists greeting its custom-

ers at the coffee shop’s front’

door on Dobson Street, with a
comic book store and record
shop nearby, no patron can help
but feel a palpable neighbor-
hood vibe.

A similar experience awaits

., you if you take the 71C bus to
' East Liberty. If you can notice
it tucked away amid the shop-

fronts on Penn Avenue, Zeke’s

Coffee will provide a getaway’

from the, tedium of boring
roasts.

With all its coffee freshly
roasted on location, Zeke’s fully
utilizes its city-wide roots. Not
only can Zeke’s roasts be found
at almost any farmer’s market
or outdoor festival inthe city,
but they also peddle their brews
to businesses and construction
sites in East Liberty strapped on
delivery bicycles. i

Needless to say, the experi-
ence of patronizing coffee shops
and coffee roasters like these
extends beyond the mug. Just
as much as Pitt students would
stand to beneﬁt from some de-
cently brewed coffee, we could
also use a heightened sense of
community with the neighbor-

hoods around us.

Traveling outside Oakland
to enjoy these places could give
anyone a greater appreciation
for the people sharing this city.
And if nothing else, it might
lead some people to reach true
enlightenment — and never use

SOCCER

Pitt brings
scoring woes
to Clemson

Andrew Stern
Staﬁ” Wrz'ter

Continued offensive struggles for Pitt men’s
soccer led head coachjoe Luxbacher to ques-
tion the team’s effort following its recent loss

A to William & Mary. Between the team’s two

recent matches, the Panthers recorded just
one shot on goal.

“We got outplayed tonight,” Luxbacher
said Tuesday. “But it’s because a few of our
guys did not show up with their A game to-
night.”

The Panthers (0-7-4, 0-5-2 ACC) travel to
play the No. 9 Clemson Tigers (8-3-2, 3-2-2

ACC) for an ACC match tonight in hopes of .

registering a more spirited effort. The match
at Riggs Field will serve as the ﬁnal road game
of the season for the Panthers.

Pitt heads to South Carolina looking not
only for its ﬁrst win of the season, but also
for the team’s ﬁrst goal since Kevin Murray
scored against Xavier on Oct. 1.

“We’ve tried many different things to
score, but it’s just not happening,” Luxbacher
said. “The main thing we [constantly] tell the
guys is that we do not go forward when we
have a chance.”

Because of the competition the Panthers
face, _Luxbacher’s offensive strategy entails
keepinga midﬁelder back to lessen the likeli-
hood of a counterattack if the Panthers don’t
score. As a result, Pitt sends two forwards
into the teeth of four or ﬁve backs in an at-
tempt to score.

“There are times when we have a chance
to take a shot, but we pull it back and start
again,” Luxbacher said. “You’ve got to take
your chances and take shots in the offensive
third, and we’ve got to shoot more.” $1

Panthers look to sync offensive, defensive units

Since aiiowing 55 points to Dukeon Sept.21, Pitt’s defense has let up 22 points the past two games. Bobby Mizia |Visual Editor

Nate Barnes

Sports Editor
The last time Pitt football was tasked with
defending a dynamic, dual-threat quarter-
back, Florida State’s Jameis Winston threw
for 356 yards and four touchdowns. As the
Panthers (3-2, 2-2 ACC) hit the midway Point
of their 2013 season Saturday against the Old
Dominion Monarchs (4-2), the Monarchs are
led by quarterback Taylor Heinicke who is
dangerous with his arm and legs.

This season, Heinicke has racked up 2,088
passing yards and and 235 on the ground. He-
inicke enters Saturday’s game with<14 passing
touchdowns, accompanied by another ﬁve
scores on the ground. _ -

“He’s got a really great understanding of

t the game,” Pitt head ‘coach Paul Chryst said.

“He gets yards rushing, but he’s looking to
extend plays and stay alive in the pocket.”
The previous three weeks have seen He-
inicke compile over 1,000 yards of total of-
fense, alongside nine touchdowns.
“He can get the ball out of his hands fast,”
Chryst said. “They really spread the ﬁeld, and

he can get it to a lot of spots because he has
a strong arm.”

With Heinicke’s offensive capabilities,
defensive ends coachjohn Palermo called
preparation for this week a “nightmare.”

Palermo’s unit has played well recently,
like the rest of Pitt’s defense since it allowed
55 points at Duke. ’

“I think we were average at best against
Florida State,” Palermo said. “Since then,
we’ve played pretty danm good.” i

Pitt’s defense faces another challengein
the Monarchs’ offense, led by Heinicke. Old
Dominion’s last game, a 21-17 victory over
Liberty, saw the Monarchs compile 550 yards
of total offense. ,

For Chryst, the key as always is to play
assignment-sound football on the defensive
side against Old Dorninion’s spread offense
scheme.

“I think it’s a good scheme, but they have
good players running it,” Chryst said. “They
have some guys that when they get the ball in
their hands, and get in space, they’re pretty
good.”

-Pitt’s own “pretty good” players, Devin
Street and Tyler Boyd, look to rebound from
their least productive week of the season.
Chryst said Street is a gametime decision af-
ter he sustained a shoulder injury at Virginia
Tech, as is running backjames Conner.

As a result, Isaac Bennettwill likely receive
aboost to his carry total this week. Pitt looks
to establish the running game after the Pan-
thers recorded just 23 yards on the ground in
Blacksburg last week.

“We’ve just got to go back to the basics,
what we were doing in the summer,” Ben-
nett said.

If the Panthers can establish the run,
Chryst said that would “absolutely” take
pressure off an offensive line that has allowed
quarterback Tom Savage to be sacked 15 times
between the team’s last two games.

“I just think we’ve got to get back to trust-
ing some of the things individually with tech-
nique,” Chryst said. “We’ve got to do a better

job of making plays, that changes the game.
Maybe it’s running the football or making a
catch to get a little bit of momentum.” ﬁg

The PPW is based on an average eater’s wing

and $1 off appetizers, which include wings, on
Fridays. Seeingas the price does notin anyway

consider to be the ﬁve most important char— -
acteristics of wing joints. Each restaurant can '

Grading the Oakland wing scene

more distinct options, such as cajun ranch rub
and seasoned garlic Parmesan, and the most
peculiar “kitchen sink” ﬂavor. All palates and
wing fanatics will certainly ﬁnd aﬂavor at this
pub. However, Peter’s does not offeraboneless
wing, which may or may not matter to you, but

' Peter’s receives four out of apossible ﬁve points

in terms of variety.

As far as taste is concerned, Peter’s has deli-
cious wings. They are cooked to aperfect crisp
so that the meat falls right off thecbone, ever
so delicately. The kitchen sink sauce is a deli-
cious cheese blend with a kick to it. It may be
difﬁcult to believe, but hearty is the best word
to describe the wings. Eat six of them and you
will be ﬁill and satisﬁed. Peter’s gets ﬁve out of
ﬁve points for taste. —

This brings me to convenience. Located
on Oakland Avenue with a kitchen that’s open
until midnight, Peters is in an ideal location for
Pitt students, but it’s still not as convenient as
places that deliver. Peter’s receives four out of
ﬁve points for convenience.

Lastly, Peter’s is a great environment, espe-
ciallyfor sportsfans. With televisions all around
the bar; there is always_a game to watch. Plus,
the popcorn machine is aunique andfuntouch.
Peter’s is the ideal spot to watch football on
weekends because with every game, beer and
wings are readily available. Peter’s earns ﬁve
out of ﬁve points for the X—factor.

Hemingway’s Café (Grade: B+)

Hemingwayfs offers a PPW of 80 cents.
However, Hemingway’s erases the differential
between themselves and Peter’s by offering
half—off specials on their appetizers, including
wings, from 11 to 11:45 a.m., 2 to 4 p.m. and 9
p. m. to midnight every day. The wings may not
be the greatest, but they are very cheap for the
majority of the day so they earn ﬁve out of a ﬁve

l possible points for value.

, Like Peter’s, Hemingway’s offers a number
of differentwing types —from the typical buf-
falo to the more outlandish jerk and sweet and
spicy sauces, but they have left boneless wings
off their menu, as well, leaving them with four
out of ﬁve points for variety. ’

Although I have not experienced every ﬂa-
vor Hemingways offers, I have t11'ed the buffalo
and garlic Parmesan ﬂavors, and they were
good — but not great. If Peter’s was not open,
I would deﬁnitely head to Hemingway’s, but

the wings did not blow me away. They receive
four out of ﬁve points for taste.

Hemingway’s is located right on Forbes Av-
enue, easily accessible to all students until the
kitchen closes at midnight. However, they do
not offer delivery, so they can only receive four
out of ﬁve points for convenience.

Lastly, Hemingway’s is another good spot
to watch the game, and there seems to be a
constant stream of happy—hour specials. The
shot pitchers are a unique touch, as well. They
get ﬁve out of ﬁve points for the X-factor.

In the end, Petefs wings nudge out Heming-
way’s by a score of 23 to 22 out of 25 possible
points, butbetween the two of them, they have
certainly put Pittsburgh’s wings on the map.

Respecting the avocado:
proper preparation is key

Sophia Al Rasheed
Columnist

I recall the ﬁrst time I laid eyes on an avocado.
As much as I can’t picture my life without
it today, it’s interesting to think I didn’t ini-
tially give it a second glance. I couldn’t accept
everyone’s claims that something so rugged
on the outside could hold anything so vibrant
and delectable on the inside. I

But this is just one of the many life lessons
we can learn from the avocado: that ﬁrst im-
pressions aren’t always what they seem, that
we shouldn’t judge from appearances and
that which you once ignored can become a
staple in your life.

The most wonderful lesson I’ve learned
is that something you truly love can love you
back. What  made this food so popular is
not just its distinct, buttery taste, but that it’s
actually good for you. Rich in vitamins and
constituted of good fat — mostly monoun-
saturated —- and minerals, it’s one of those
rare foods thatis as beneﬁcialas it is enjoyable.

With that said, I think it’s very important
that we treat this ﬁuit with the respect it de-
serves. Too easily can its beneﬁts be sacri-
ﬁced during hasty preparation. For example,
consuming the avocado in prepackaged gua-
camole, albeit delicious, will not likely give
you its ﬁill beneﬁts because of additives and
preservatives. Let’s not forget that, out of shy-
ness to air exposure, this guy also turns brown
rather quickly.

Take it from an obvious advocate: The best
way to incorporate the avocado into your diet
is to use it as your base and work your way
around it, so neither its health beneﬁts nor
taste go to waste.

One last thing before we get into recipes:
You’ll have to limit consumption to the proper
serving size of halfan avocado. I know, it’s

tough, but we can’t forget that any more than
the actual serving size will rack on excessive
calories and will not provide you with the
maximum beneﬁt.

The simplest way to consume such a lim-
ited amount of _avocado without the risk of
tarnishing it is by scooping it and eating the
fruit on its own. After pitting it, sprinkle with
salt, pepper and, most importantly, apinch of
garlic powder. Minimal spices will allow you to
experience the under-exaggerated ﬂavors in
the euphoric “Ratatouille” style — you know,

where everything turns black and Remy is .

transported into heaven. This is at least how
my ﬁrst raw avocado experience — and every
one after that —— seemed to transpire.

Side note (since we’re at this point): If
you ever feel that your guacamole is “rniss—
ing something,” it’s probably garlic.

Another step up for incorporating avocado
is inspired by the Shadyside Scrambler at Red
Oak Cafe on Forbes Avenue. The soft texture
of eggs and the soﬁ: texture of avocado would
appear to be odd complements, but trust me
on this. Myfavorite version is scrambled eggs
with spinach, topped with slices of avocado
and — brace yourself — a sprinkle of feta
cheese. '

Another side note: As a Pittsburgher, I
find myself troubled by eating eggs without
ketchup on the side. But for those with similar
problems, the distinct avocado and egg taste
is not at riskwith the incorporation of Heinz.
If it seems like we’re stretching to all comers
of the globe foradish, it’s because we are, and
it’s delicious.

These are the safer routes for avocado us-
age, but when you’re ready to step up from the
soft— core game, you might be interested in the
next step: utilizing its creaminess. 5
