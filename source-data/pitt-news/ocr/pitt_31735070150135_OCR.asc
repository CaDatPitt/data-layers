For The Pitt News

To many, a butterﬂy is nothing
more than a colorful insect, but
to the Zajdel family, it represents
much more.

With the help of his family,
Pitt students and siblings Sean
and Lindsay Zajdel started the
Michelle Zajdel Butterﬂy Project.
He hopes to raise $10,000 for a
student scholarship in honor of
his sister, who had Turner syn-
drome — a chromosomal irregu-
larity that results in a number of
physical abnormalities, including ‘
short height. The scholarship will
be awarded to one future Pitt ap-
plicant who has the potential for
great success but hasn’t been fully
appreciated throughout his or her
life, like Sean’s sister Michelle.

Sean described Michelle as an
extremely intelligent person who
spoke her mind. But the teasing
she encountered because of her
short stature made her feel dif-
ferent and resulted in depression
and insomnia. Consequently, many
of her great qualities weren’t ap-

preciated to the extent that they

should have.

In July 2008, Michelle Zajdel
passed away. Although her fam-
ily declined to comment on the
speciﬁc details regarding her pass-
ing, Sean said he believes bullying
and insomnia were contributing
factors. A

“The constant bullying she
faced resulted in a big accident
that took her life,” Sean said.

After Michelle’s death, the Za-
jdel family noticed that butterﬂies
were frequently around them. At
one point while the family was
outside, a butterfly sat on Sean’s

students

sister Lindsay’s arm. Diane Zajdel,
Michelle’s mother, even recalls
seeing a number of butterﬂies at
Michelle’s memorial.

Soon, the family realized that

these butterﬂy sightings weren’t P

a mere coincidence. Instead, the
butterﬂy became a symbol for
Michelle. H .

“The butterﬂy shows the kind
of person she was,” Diane ex-
plained. “But she never really got
to ﬂy. We didn’t get to see how
beautiful her colors were.”

To honor his sister and raise
awareness of the "negative effects
that bullying can have on a person,
Sean .came up with the Michelle
Zajdel Butterﬂy Project, which is
now trying to raise $10,000 for a
scholarship. Sean said Pitt’s Office
of Institutional Advancement will
workwith the Office of Admissions
and Financial Aid to establish pa-
rameters for the scholarship based

on criteria outlined by the Zajdel

family.

As a result of receiving the But-
terfly Project scholarship, Diane
said, the chosen student will have
the chance to'feel special — his or
her true colors and achievements
will ﬁnally be recognized, rather
than ignored.

Sean and Lindsay oversee all
donations made to the Michelle
Zajdel Butterﬂy Project. Not only
do they document all deposits
made, but they also take the col-
lected money to the bank and de-
posit it themselves.  _

“We do it all ourselves,” he said.

i “We want to make sure we don’t

lose any money.”
Although Sean isn’t able to put
the money raised into a personal

In a highly unusualoccurrence,
Pitt’s music department brought
in three new faculty members this
year to replace three retirees. Even
more unlikely: The three have pre-
vious ties to one another.

The department hired Rachel

n

Mundy and Emily Zazulia this year, ‘

while the third, Gavin Steingo, was

hired in 2010 but deferred until‘

this year to ﬁnish his postdoc-
toral study. Mundy, an assistant
professor of 20th-century music,
and Steingo completed the same
postdoctoralstudy at Columbia
University before entering Pitt.
Zazulia, an assistant professor in
medieval and Renaissance music,
also attended graduate school with
Steingo at the University of Penn-
sylvania.

Steingo, an assistant professor
of African music, marveled at the
improbable hirings. “They ended
up getting three people in the
same year, which is very unusual,”
Steingo said. “And not only that,
but three people who were quite
closely connected, even though
the search had nothing to do with
that.” r
J Mundy was likewise surprised
and pleased.

“For all three of us, getting a
job at a school like Pitt is actually
a real privilege,” she said. “It’s very
exciting. I was just looking to get
something.”

The department began its
search for new faculty in 2008 af-

" ter faculty members Don Franklin

and Mary Lewis, who bath spe-
cialized in historical musicology,
retired.

Weintraub said there were more
than 150 applicants for the two his-
torical musicology positions and
about 45 for the ethnomusicology
opening. During the search pro-
cess, part-time faculty frequently
stood in for the missing ﬁ1ll-time
members. . A

“We’d been searching for some-
one to replace those retirement
people for about four years, and
we weren’t successful,” Weintraub
said. “But the University kept sup-
porting us.”

In 2010, a third retirement by
Bell Yung, who specialized in Chi-
nese ethnomusicology, added to
the dilemma.

But the lengthy search process

‘ eventually came to fruition, as the

three hired each bring a unique and
diverse background to the depart-

account, because the University doesn’t allow
this, he has set up two PNC bank accounts

in the name of his fraternity, Pi Kappa Phi._

Once all the money is raised, it goes directly
to the University.

' According to Sean, $10,000 is the mini-
mum amount of money Pitt requires for a
scholarship to be created. The scholarship
will end up being worth $500 per year.

But to Sean, that amount might not be
enough. He hopes to raise up to $250,000 _so
that the student receives a full scholarship,
rather than the $500 amount.

Pitt spokesman John Fedele believes the
Zajdel siblings are doing the unprecedented
by raising money for a scholarship.

“I can tell you that it is not common for
students to create scholarships, period,”
Fedele said in an email.

Currently, the family has raised more than
$5,000 through donations and is continuing
to accept money. Sean has been tabling in
Litchﬁeld Towers Lobby and will continue to
do so on Tuesday, Thursday and Friday from
5 to 6 p.m. Cash donations are accepted, and
Pitt students can donate via Panther Funds
on Tuesday and Thursday. Checks mailed
to the Zajdel’s home address are acceptable
and donations using PayPal can be made by
visiting the Michelle Zajdel Butterﬂy Project
website —— mzbutterﬂyproject.cloudaccess.
net. The family will sell Michelle Zajdel But-
terﬂy Project T-shirts at the corner of Bigelow
Boulevard and Forbes Avenue on Wednesday
for $6, and half the proceeds will go to fun-
draising for the scholarship.

Diane expressed some regret over not be-
ing able to fully appreciate Michelle’s positive
effect on people until after her death. But she
feels that if Michelle were aware of what the
family was doing, she would be satisﬁed.

“She would be smiling down on us,” Di-
ane said. I l

ment, Weintraub said. .

“They bring different areas of interest.
They are young, so they bring a really fresh
approach to what’s going on,” he said. “We’re
trying to teach students how to maybe ﬁnd
some new opportunities and think about
music in a different way and inspire them so
they enrich their own musical.lives.”

The three each have their own ways of
doing this. V, ‘ ‘

“Speaking from my own perspective, I

_think the thing that ties us together is that
we all have a slightly unorthodox approach '

to thinking about music, but we all have
different roles,” Steingo said.

Along with leading an African ensemble,
a group currently consisting of 22 students
that play both traditional and contemporary
African music, Steingo teaches two classes
on African music. _

“There’s a mythology of African music,”
he said. “My job is to get people toget past
that mythological way of listening and get
them to try to reﬂect on how they’re listen-
irlg.” .

Steingo also focuses on the _bigger~pic-
ture issues surrounding music.

“I’m trying to give people the sense that
music is not some elusive or ineffable thing,

but we can actually talk about it, understand ‘

it, think about it,” Steingo said.

Part of the way Steingo emphasizes his
idea is shedding light on the global forms
of music—making.

“So not to think of America and Africa as‘
separate, but to think of circulation between
Africa and America, which is what popular
music is, but from the perspective of Africa,”
he said. “If we look at music technology
from the perspective of Africa, it actually
gives us a different vantage point, on the
same issues.”

The idea of examining perspectives

)

through music also ‘interests Mundy and
Zazulia. For Zazulia, the connection between
the concepts of music and time 4 her main
area of expertise and research — factors
heavily into her teachings. ‘

T “We always talk about the nature of time

‘ and the organization of time. We also talk

about, on a larger scale, in what ways music
organizesour day,” Zazulia said. “In the
Middle Ages, one’s life was built around
certain things being sung at certain times.

‘ This rhythm of life is still governing ours,

as well.” .

As the medieval and Renaissance periods
represent widely studied topics, Zazulia re-
alized there were similarly themed courses
within the _University applicable to her music
students.-

“I hope to draw students from those pro-
grams and get my own students to branch
out and interact with scholars in [medieval
and Renaissance] departments,” Zazulia
said. A —

Mundy has similar hopes of “building
bridges” between departments.‘

While her area of focus is 20th-century
mifsic, she’s also conducting a side project
studying bird songs.

“I can talk to people in sciences about this
research, because it deals with evolutionary
biology,” Mundy said. “ [Pitt] also [has] a
very strong department in the history and
philosophy of science. Because of that, it’s a
nice way to build bridges with other_people
in the University.” _ V '

Like her colleagues, Mundy also focuses
on the understanding of music. She said the
way we experience and consume music has
changed drastically within the past century,
adding that music no longer exists just in
concert halls, but on iPods, cell phones and
in dorm rooms.

“That time period created a scenario in‘
which you have to take a class in orderto
understand this music,” she said, referring
to the way in which music composed for

concert halls requires new levels of analysis

 

' now that its removed from its intended set-

ting. “It,also means you can teach students
to think critically about why that gap [in
methods of music consumption] developed.”

Mundy’s goal in teaching is clear. ,

“What I want students to walk away 
understanding [is] that no matter what they
hear, everything that you hear is something
that you as an individual are just as able to
think about critically and understand and
become a sort of responsible _listener,” she
said. V

Whether that sound comes from
Beethoven or a hummingbird, Mundy said,
“You can learn to think about so‘und as part
of your world in the way that you think about
everything else.” .

Mundy also specializes in the Japanese
ﬂute and even has a teaching license, written
in Japanese, hanging in her office. Mundy
said that with enough interest, she’d love
to teach about the instrument.

Zazulia and Steingo also have their spe-
ciﬁc areas of performance. ' .

This year is Steingo’s ﬁrst time. leadin
an ensemble, and he admits it will be a “bit
of an experiment,” as he’s trying to accom-
modate the range of levels of expertise and
training among his students in his African
ensemble. - ,

. “_.[The] ensemble does do traditional mu-
sic, but also popular music to show how the
pop music is always‘ relating to. the history
of Africa,” Steingo said. ' A ‘ .

Zazulia, who is formally trained in cho-
ral singing, will also experiment with per’-
formance teaching. Next semester, she’ll
teach a course, Singing Early Music, and
hopes to start a choir at Pitt focusing on
the same idea. ' ‘

. V In reference to her starthere at Pitt, Za-

zulia said, “I  it’s a really exciting time
in the department. We’ve got great things
going’ on.” V . ’ V . '

“All three are very vibrant scholars who
are doing very interes'ting work,” Weintraub
said. I I A

The dosand don’ts of pulling

oﬂ’ a sexy Halloween costume  

Tracey Hickey
Columnist

Every Halloween since probably the
mid-’9os has come with a slew of
hand-wringing articles about sexy
Halloween costumes, why we can’t
escape them and what they say about
our culture.

This Halloween is not going to
be one of them. Although the pres-
sure that can leave girls feeling like
ugly ducldings if they don’t opt for
the Leg Avenue getup is unfortunate
and the way the revealing trend has
crept into the teen girls’ and even

the children’s department is totally ,

creepy, I am all about sexy costumes
for grown women who want to wear
them.

That -said, sexy costumes_ are
not all created equal, and some of
the most common ones are really

- terrible ideas. So for the ladies who
want to show off some T-and—A this _

Halloween without making an A of
themselves, here’s a handy list of
sexy costume Dos and Don’ts.

Do: Take the opportunity to put a
grown-up spin on classic characters.

It’s hard toigo wrong with these.
I’ve never seen a sexed-up version of
an Alice in Wonderland character
that I didn’t like, and an abbreviated-
hemline version of your favorite Dis-
ney princess is a great way to parody
and celebrate the ﬁctions you idol-
ized as a child. Sexy versions of Little
Red Riding Hood are fabulously var-
ied from cutesy to gothic, reﬂecting
the many different ways this tale is
told. Superheroines —— and villain-
esses -— such as Wonder Woman,
Harley Quinn and Catwoman are
also great choices; they have plenty
of sex appeal to begin with.

Don’t: Be racist. _ 7 _

This is good life advice in gen-
eral, but particularly applicable here.

Nothing is less sexy than being rac-

ist. Unfortunately, major costume
manufacturers have yetto catch on
to the fact that skimpy “Indian prin-
cess” costumes are hugely offensive
to Native Americans, adding cheesy,
sexualized insult to the injury of our
country’s long legacy of oppression
and genocide — including sexual
violence —— against them. Stay away
from the cheesy faux—native fringe
and feathers.

“Geisha girl” costumes do the

same thing, misinterpreting and
misappropriating the idea of a gei-
sha and selling ﬂimsy, oversexed ste-
reotypes about Asian women that so
many of them are trying to shake.
Some costumes are ambiguous,
but Iurge you to at least apply some
critical thinking skills. Dressing as
a genie, a pop—culture staple, might
be on the fence, but the “harem girl”
is deﬁnitely not. Cleopatra might
be fair game as a historical ﬁgure,
but a generic “sexy Egyptian” is just
awkward. Egyptians are people who
still exist, many of them go to school

with you, and you might run into

one at a party. Ultimately, if you’re

. wondering, “Is this costume racist?”

it’s probably not worth the risk.
There’s an obvious caveat here: If

Sexy
costumes are
not all created’

equaL and,
some of the
most common

ones are
really terrible

ideas.

you’re actually the race being paro-
died by the costume, it’s up to you
to decide what you think the joke is
and whether you’re OK with it. But
I feelpretty comfortable saying that

p if-you are white, you should not go

as a “Sexy Indian Princess.” No, not
even if you’re one—eighth Cherokee.

Do: Have a sense of humor. , _

If you’re‘goingas a food item like
a “sexy hamburger” or a “sexy lime
wedge” for Halloween, you prob-
ably already have a sense of humor
about your costume. But if you’re one

. of those people who wrinkles your

nose and clutches your pearls over
the “freaks” and “perverts” every
year when national furry convention
Anthrocon comes to town — and I

know you pearl—clutchers are out
there, because I always end up sitting
next to you on the Megabus — I had
better not see you in a “sexy panda”
costume. _

Don’t: Sexualize children.

This is another one that shouldn’t
need to be said, but the proliferation
of “sexy little girl” costumes —— some
so young that the costumes come
with paciﬁers —— suggests that it
does need to be mentioned. This is
creepy. It is creepy because we live in
a world where famous ﬁlm director
Roman Polanski is still not univer-
sally considered a rapist because

'many inﬂuential people think that

a drugged thirteen—year—old child
had the maturity to consent to sex
with a grown man. Such a costume
is also unlikely to get you laid, if
that’s something you have in mind,
because anyone who looks at your
“sexy preschooler” costume and
wants to hook up with you is some-
one you don’twant to hook up with.

Do: Be something fantastical or
swashbuckling.‘

Fantasy is what sexy costumes
are all about, which makes fairies,
vampires, witches and mermaids
awesome choices for your glittery
costume. So are vaguely based-on-
a—true—story concepts like pirates
and cowgirls, whose images in pop
culture are so removed from reality
already that making them sexy isn’t
a very big step.

Sexing up fantasy characters
is deﬁnitely the safest option for
over-thinkers like me, who wonder
whether the “sexy maid” costume
shows disdain for real-life house-
keepers — as opposed to other oc-
cupation costumes, such as “sexy
teacher” or “sexy librarian,” which
generally don’t depict occupational
roles that face quite the same strug-
gles for decent wages and working
conditions that maids do — or
whether “sexy army girl” promotes
militarism. Being a sexy version of
something imaginary gives me the
priceless safety of knowing that no
actual vampire is going to look at my
costume and feel hurt or degraded.

‘Don’t: Go as a “sexy referee”

 unless you want dudes in
sports bars to lecture you all night
about the evils wrought by replace-
ment refs. I

Why study abroad when your
  life can be monotonous?

Andrew Kaback
C0lumnz'st_

So you aren’t sure if you should study abroad.

' Yeah, I guess that I get that. I mean, there is
a lot that you would miss" out on here if you
went away for a semester or even a summer.
There could be a concert you want to see, and
abroad seems reallyafar away. It is a really
hardtdecision. _:

Not! .5  . .

If you have lived in a universe that in-
cludes social media for the last month or so, I
assume that you have been seeing a non-stop
barrage of study—abroad-relatedstatuses. I
have been hearing the study abroad talk,

with all of its usual so-called scary and dif- .

ﬁcult questions, from all types of students.
Invariably, there are always people
around campus asking themselves (and oth-
ers) if taking the plungetto go abroad is a bad
decision. Wel1,‘I’m here to tell you that it is.
Studying abroad has to be one-of the
worst choices that you can make in your
entire life. Think about it. There are more
issues than you could ever even imagine:
First of all, you have to travel. Have you
waited‘ around at an airport lately? Who

doesn’t love the classic “Who can make the ‘

‘ American border patrol guard laugh ﬁrst?”
game? The ﬂight is going to be full of small
children with parents who are fast asleep in
ﬁrst class while their rugrats take over econ-
omy class. And getting around in a foreign
airport is even worse. Imagine everything
you have in an American airport, only with
different foods and multiple languages. Vi

And think about having to move into a
new apartment. Look at how many steps the
“Jersey Shore” cast had to climb up when
they went to Florence, Italy. Some countries
have neighborhoods that don’t even have a
Starbucks. * '

Foreign restaurants can be really ridicu-
lous, as well. There are places where you
actually sit down to eat and stay there for
more than seven minutes. I know it’s alot to
handle, but think about the possibility that
you might have to drink a different brand
of soda.

The worst part is that you have to see
things of historical importance. I’m sorry,
but it already happened. I don’t know anyone
who cares that the Sistine Chapel exists.
Does anybody actually want to see the Sahara

Desert? Like, it’s sand, ‘guys. If I want to exer-
cise, I will go to the Pete‘, not Machu Picchu.

And then there is the ultimate horror of
meeting foreigners. They are so different.
Sometimes theyspeak multiple languages
and don’t evenvcknow who Johnny Apple-
seed was. Don’t even try to ask about music
or movies, because you might have to wait

. until signiﬁc_aritly.after media is out in the

Unitedstates-to.ise'e it abroad. Catch-up on
“Titanic,”"wo‘rld, so that we can debate if
therewas room forjack on the raft. ’

Oh, and then there’s.all of the experiences

' here in Oakland that you will miss out on. I

mean think of all of the awful pizza you won’t
be able to eat and the depressingly  win-
ters you won’t be a part of. _You might even
miss an opportunity to hang out with that
one guy who’ has aaporch across the Boule-
vard‘ of theAllies. Why would anyone ‘choose
to spend an evening in the Latin‘ Quarter of
Paris overvwaitingiflor. the 10A to eventually
move in any direction? A '

Don’t even talk to me abo’ut.tlie people
on your. trip ‘who you aregoing-t_o have to
interactwith. They,come_from-all‘ over the
country and can haveweird accents. There
could be people who‘. are spontaneous ortry
new experiences. And after your trip, they
mightoeven try to keep in touch with you.
Keep off, bro. ‘ I -

You might have to learn a new language. If

- English has gotten me this far in life, I think it

can take me afew years more. People outside
the United States think it’s totally normal
to say words that don’t make any sense to
me. Worth the confusion? I’m going with a
no. It’s not like globalization is happening
that fast, right?

Most importantly of all, you might
change. By doing all of that sightseeing,
meeting new people, adjusting to different
customs and cultural norms, mastering city

plans and train schedules and experiencing a,

different way of life, you might change your

perspectives. I’m not a big fan of maturing‘

or personal growth. V -
So.you’re deciding whether you should
study abroad? let me make the decision easy
for you. Don’t go. Stay at home. Stay in the
country. Unless you want _to do something
that might make youthink, act and live in
new ways, I would say that you should stay
right here in Pittsburgh. I

with seasonal local apples, that isn’t likely
to happen. '

Locally grown foods — which are pro-
duced seasonally — taste much fresher.
But shopping seasonally is not only ben-
eﬁcial for your taste buds. By purchasing
seasonal local foods, you are contributing
to local farms and lessening the environ-

mental damage caused by shipping foods.»

Somelof the seasonal foods of fall — in

kins — are cranberries, broccoli, eggplant,
pears, peppers, yams, squash and rutaba—

of my favorite things to do. Odd? Perhaps.

t Pitt overcomes slow start against Georgetown in conference play i

Torie Wytiaz
Senior Staff Writer

It was the focus all week during practice, and '

blocking proved to be the difference in the Pitt
volleyball team’s win last Friday night.

In the victory over Georgetown at the
Fitzgerald Field House, the Panthers (12-10,
3-5 Big East) recorded a season—high 13 blocks
— led by junior outside hitter Monica Wignot’s
eight. Sophomore hitter Kate Yeazel chipped
in with ﬁve blocks.

“Blocking has been emphasized in practice
since the beginning of the season,” Wignot
said. “We were able to execute it well against
Georgetown.”

Head coach Toby Rens agreed, acknowl-
edging the play of both Wignot and Yeazel in
the Georgetown match. -

“We did some great things defensively and
had some big plays blocking,” Rens said. “Kate
and Monica did a particularly good job at the
net with their blocking.”

Despite the Panthers’ success against the
Hoyas, they fell to the Villanova Wildcats Sun-
day in a 3-1 loss, splittingtheir crucial weekend
home series.

Pitt 3, Georgetown 1

‘Wignot led the way for the Panthers both
in terms of blocks and kills as Pitt defeated
Georgetown (6-13, 0-6 Big East) in four sets
with scores of 20-25, 25-20, 25-18 and 25-20.

In the match, Wignot had a team—best 11
kills and a career—best eight blocks. With her
performance, Wignot tallied double—digit kill
ﬁgures for the third consecutive match, but she
attributed the win to a team effort.

“We were very in sync today,” Wignot said.
“We played together as a team rather than six
individuals on the court.”

The Panthers dropped the ﬁrst set, but Pitt
regained momentum and took the second with
the help of senior Alexa Campbell’s four kills.
For Rens, the Panthers were able to put the
opening set loss behind them as they fought
to earn the second set win.

“I felt that we came out ﬂat in the ﬁrst set
and that Georgetown was prepared for us,”
Rens said. “I was pleased with the changes
that we made in the following sets, as we did
what we needed to do down the stretch to get
the win.” ’ .

In the third set, freshman Amanda Orchard
had all four of her match kills as the Panthers
earned their largest set victory of the contest.

Then Wignot’s four blocks paired with
four kills by sophomores Jessica Wynn and
Mechael Guess sealed the Pitt match victory
in the fourth set.

Falcons, Giants off to solidstarts in NFC

Isaac Saul
Senior Staff Wrz'ter

With six weeks of the NFL season in the books,
teams are starting to show their true colors.

Division races are developing, coaches’
seats are getting hot and the traditionally
dominant teams are just ﬁnding their groove.

Here is a division-by-division breakdown
of storylines from the NFC to follow as the
season continues to take shape.

NFC East 

After atrouncing of the talented San Fran-
cisco 49ers, the New York Giants regained
the top position in the division and reclaimed
their conﬁdence in being the top team in the
league. Notonly did they beat the 49ers by 23
points, they did it onthe road on a day during
which San Francisco quarterback Alex Smith
threw more interceptions than he has thrown
in two years. «

Meanwhile, the Philadelphia Eagles and
the Dallas Cowboys both took hits this week,
and both seem to be showing signs of incon-
sistency. '

Keep an eye on Andy Reid’s job while you’re
at it —- the longtime Eagles head coach has a

team that can’t complete a shotgun snap, a
quarterback who can’t hold onto the ball and
any overpaid defense that can’t seem to slow
anyone down.

' In the middle of the division, .there’s the
perpetually poor Washington Redskins. But
this year, with the same mediocre grolip of
talent we’ve come to expect from the Redskins,
there is one big difference: They are being led
by Robert Griffin III.

The rookie quarterback sensation broke off
a 76-yard touchdown run against the previous-
ly 4-1 Minnesota Vikings in the fourth quarter
Sunday, sealing the winfor the Redskins. With
him at the helm — and healthy —— the ’Skins
are in every game.

NFC North -

Perhaps the strongest division in the
league this year, games against NFC North
squads have proven to be a tough matchup
for anyone involved.

Unfortunately for the Vikings, Chicago
Bears and Detroit Lions, it looks as though
Aaron Rodgers and the Green Bay Packers
just woke up from a coma after dismantling
the previously undefeated Houston Texans
on national television Sunday night.

However, the Bears are quietly 4-1 with the

best defense in the league, the Vikings have
stud running back Adrian Peterson, and the
Lions — led by Calvin “Megatron” Johnson
— have one of the most explosive offenses
in the league, evidenced by the fact that they
outscore everyone in the fourth quarter.
The important thing to watch in this divi-

’ sion is how badly these guys beat each other

up. There is no doubt in my mind that any
three of these four teams are strong enough
to be playoff teams in the NFC, but they’ve got
to maintain strong records.

Having to see- each other twice this year
will not be easy. ’
NFC South ,

The Atlanta Falcons are the only unde-
feated team left in the NFL. They have two

more wins than the rest of the division’s teams .

combined. That is all.

' As a mandatory side note, the Saints seem
to be paying the price for “Bountygate,” hav-
ing the worst start we’ve seen from them in
a while. At 1-4 andlcoming off their ﬁrst win
of the season, New Orleans still shouldn’t be
counted out -— not with Drew Brees at quar-
terback.

NFC West I _

After spending years as the urinal of the
NFL, it appears the NFC West has found one
—— and maybe even three — real “competi-
tive teams. Seattle, San Francisco and Ari-
zona rank second, third and-fourth in points-
against this season.

With the second most effective defense
in the league and rookie quarterback Rus-
sell Wilson, who has beaten both Tom Brady
and Aaron Rodgers in the fourth quarter this
season, the Seahawks are beginning to look
like real competitors. _ .

The 49ers, until this past Sunday, looked

like the best team in the NFL. But Smith was
exposed by a savvy Giants defense and 49ers
fans everywhere will be praying this week
that his performance against New York was
an anomaly.

Arizona has been the surprise of the NFL
this year, and with a defense that is generating
turnovers, keeping points off the board and
keeping star wide .receiver (and former Pitt

Pitt dominated the ﬁrst set, recording 15
kills to Villanova’s eight. After battling to a 4-4
tie, the Panthers led for the remainder of the

‘set, eventually winning 25-15. Campbell led

theiPanthers with four killsin the set.
In the second set, the Wildcats jumped out

p to an early 6-1 lead, but the Panthers managed

to bring the score to a 21-21 tie. However, two

errors by Pitt and two Villanova kills gave the :

Wildcats the set win. . ~

The third set saw a similar pattern of early
ties and lead changes, withthe latest tie com-
ing at the 11-11 mark. After that point, the
Wildcats held on to the lead for the rest of the
set and gained a 2-1 match advantage.

In the ﬁnal set of the match, Pitt held the
lead from the 8-8 point. But Villanova kept
the-match close and tied the score at 22 be-
fore they scored three of the ﬁnal four points
to take the match victory in a hard-fought
contest. 1 '

Campbellled the Panthers with her 11 kills,
While Guess, Wynn and Yeazel each contrib-
uted 10. According to Yeazel, the difference
in the match was Pitt’s inability to retain the
focus that it had in its opening set win.

“We played really well in the ﬁrst set and
executed our game plan,” Yeazel said. “We
let up in the rest of the match and couldn’t

mentally shift backto the focus we seemed

to have early on.”

The Panthers will return to action at the
Fitzgerald Field House on Friday as they face
conference opponent St. John’s. I
