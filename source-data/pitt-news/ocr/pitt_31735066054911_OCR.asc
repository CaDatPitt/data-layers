Penguin superstar Mario Lemieux
learned how fragile life was when he was
diagnosed with Hodgkin’s disease in
January of 1993. _

After his treatment in May of that year,
Lenrieux formed the‘ Mario Lemieux
Foundation to assist cancer research pro-

“I am very excited about the founda-

new laboratory for ongoing cancer
research,” Lemieux said. “The Lemieux
Foundation is not a short—term project for

Mayortouts city’s financial

stability in re

“Matt Samuel

VV1th spring primaries coming up,
Pittsburgh Mayor Tom Murphy has kicked

' off his re—election campaign, touting the
ﬁnancial stability of the area as a reason new .

businesses should move into the city.
Murphy hosted a holiday party for
Oakland, Shadyside, and surrounding com-
munities recently, and spoke of the past, the
present, and the future of Pittsburgh ﬁnances.
‘Three years ago, we had a plan for the
city of Pittsburgh,” said Murphy. “We want-
ed to balance the city budget without raising
taxes, and to grow.” I
According to Murphy, since he’s taken

. oﬁice the Pittsburgh economy is very stable.

He said the city plans to move the economy
ahead further via a series of reconstruction
and development projects in the area.

The city has acquired over 600 acres of
land and is now offering tax breaks to new

industries interested in the properties. In the -

past, these companies avoided Pittsburgh
because the taxes were too high.

“Pittsburgh is now on the list of ﬁnan-
cially—kind cities,” said Murphy. “And we
also have a great base of customers here in
Pittsburgh.”

The mayor challenged those in ‘atten-
dance to bring in names of companies or
manufacturers looking to move to cities, and
give them to him so that he can show them
what Pittsburgh has to oifer.

Murphy pointed out the restoration of

WEATHER

 

election bid

the Homes department store downtown as
an example of the city’s dedication to busi-
nesses. He said he also wants to provide a
better shopping scene downtown by bring-
ing in more national department stores like
Nordstrorns. -

Currently there is $600 million worth of
developing going on in Pittsburgh to increase
commerce. Next year, the city will break
ground on a billion dollars worth of develop-
ment, which includes revamping buildings
and streets on the South Side.

The Mayor said he also wants to beauti-
fy Panther Hollow, expand the trails in
Schenley Park, and add parking for com-
muters going downtown.

Murphy said he would like to see the V

revitalization of Oakland by working with
Pitt to help the expansion of dormitories and
other /campus facilities.

But according to the mayor, the most

important thing that has happened in A

Pittsburgh over the past ‘few years while he’s
been in office is the decrease of the city’s
crime rate.

The city police have focused in on pub-
lic service, and on things like juvenile crimes
over the past few years, according to
Murphy. And now there is an 18-percent
decline in crime in Pittsburgh. _

“Every time you do something different

or better, 100 people say that it can’t be '

done,” said Murphy. “The goal of our

administration is to" tell those people that

we’re sick of that excuse, and that we are
going to do it.”

Thousands bombard Serbian
buildings in protest of election

Around the World

JAMMU, India —— An explosion
aboard a train headed toward J ammu-
Kashmir yesterday killed 12 people
and injured 39. The explosion in the
train’s sleeper car occurred as the
train was leaving the station in
Ambala, 250 miles south of Jammu—
Kashmir.

The train had been at the station
for a 15-minute stopover right before
the explosion occurred. Police said
that no group has claimed responsibil-
ity yet, but Kashmiri separatists have
previously tried to blow up trains by
planting bombs on the tracks.

BELGRADE, Yugoslavia — Tens of
thousands of people protested against
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic
yesterday because of a court ruling
two weeks ago that annulled opposi-
tion victories in ‘local elections.
During a snowstorm, 10,000 stu-

dents marched through blustery
Belgrade, some carrying ﬂowers and
others carrying signs that said “We are
not fascists.” Government buildings
were bombarded by snowballs later in
the day-when 60,000 people gathered
to protest. Associated Press

UPMC launches revolutionary
cardiac arrest program downtown

 

Jennifer Halu k

A new research program that may save
more lives from sudden cardiac arrest is now
stationed downtown and is one of the ﬁrst in
its kind in the country.

The Galbreath Company, the
University of Pittsburgh Medical Center,
and Survivalink Corporation of Minneapolis
have begun a joint research program to pro
vide early treatment for cardiac arrest vic-
tims at the USX Tower in Pittsburgh.

Sudden cardiac arrest is a leading cause
of death in the United States. The great
majority of cardiac arrests occur out of the
hospital and are due to a ventricular ﬁbrilla-
tion — a state in which the heart quivers in
an uncoordinated manner and is unable to
effectively pump blood.

The only effective treatment of this
abnormal heart activity is to electrically
countershock the heart through a process of
deﬁbrillation. The earlier the countershock is
perfonned, the greater the likelihood of sur-
vival and the less brain damage will occur.

This research program was created in
response to a call by the American Heart
Association for a wider availability of deﬁb-
rillation devices. The AHA also hopes to
provide ﬁrst responders with access and the
proper training to the device.

According to the AHA, ﬁrst responders
are emergency or community services per-
sonnel who are expected to respond to med-
ical emergencies, and who are typically the

ﬁrst on the scene. They can include para-
medics, EMTs, Basic Life Support
Ambulance personnel, ﬁreﬁghters, volun—
teers, and police officers.

Through this program, Survivalink
hopes to see the deﬁnition of ﬁrst responders
to include hospital staif, personnel in physi-
cians’ oﬁices, commercial security person-
nel, and staff people at health clubs and golf
courses.

‘This part of the study at the USX
Tower is to help determine the impact that
public access to autorrrated deﬁbrillations
will have on cardiac arrest survival rates in
commercial office buildings,” said VIDCC
Mosesso, M.D., assistant professor of emer-
gency medicine at UPMC.

The program will include the use of an
automated extemal deﬁbrillator, known as
Vrvalink, developed and marketed by the
Galbreath Company. The device which is
inexpensive and lightweight, was approved
by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
in February 1995. To date, more than 20
lives have been saved by the use of this
device.

“Survivalink is pleased to see. this his-
toric study launched and that we are part of
this important program,” said Bryon
Gilman, Survivalink chairman. “Studies like
this are the pioneering efforts that will lead to
a national solution to sudden cardiac arrest.
When we ﬁrst started working on a deﬁbril-
lator, we envisioned the day when oﬁice
buildings, sports complexes and police cars
would all be equipped with one.”

Fraternity

' system at Pitt If the group falls below 10, it

will lose recognition.

Once there are 20 men, the interest ’

group applies to become an organization.
Then the real work begins. After the group
achieves organization status, an invitation
from the vice chancellor of student affairs is
needed to apply to the IFC.

In most cases, the group will appeal to
the vice chancellor, or the nationals will peti-

_ tion an expansion at Pitt, but an invitation is

required to move further in the process.

If the expansion is approved by the IFC,
the fraternity is recognized as a colony at Pit.

The colony period lasts one year, during
which the colony must provide adequate
housing, choose a chapter advisor, maintain a
2.5 QPA and perform two oommunity ser-
vice projects a year.

The group must also attend IFC meet-
ings in which they are welcomed to partici-
pate but not vote, pay IFC dues, and attend
Greek education programs sponsored by the
IFC. They are expected to register a roster
with the counsel and participate in IFC intra-
mural sporting events and mixers.

The group must obey IFC university
policies and must have 25 members before
the IFC will send their decision on whether to
recognize the fraternity to the vice chancellor

of student aifairs.

This year at Pitt there are two fraternities
whithout charters and one fraternity which
received their charter last spring.

The brothers of Tau Kappa Epsilon were

in that situation but were recognized last’

April. L

’ “It started in my living room two years
ago,” recalled Seth Guzman, former TKE
president and founding father. “It was me and
two other guys.”

According to Guzman, TKE [as a
house] was chosen because they knew it was
a large fraternity.

Guzman said getting members was not
the hardest part of starting TKE at Pitt, as they
had expected. He said he marketed TKE
using the right sales pitch and everything /fell
into place.

“I took it on like a marketing strategy,”
said Guzman. “I targeted certain groups of
students who were untouched, who were
being left out because of the stereotypes.”

He said it was harder to start a fraternity
at Pitt as compared to a rural university. A

“On an urban campus,” Guzman said,
“You’re not as big a draw as you would be at
Penn State. People see you as just a nuisance
or a pest or a liability. There are lots of bars
and other things for people to do.”

College Republicans’ president pursues activist roles at Pitt .

Melissa McGee

Matt Mills loves Pitt.

He remembers watching Pitt against
Georgia in the 1981 Sugar Bowl in his
basement on a little black and white televi-
sion while the rest of his family was watch-
ing Nebraska versus Clemson.

He remembers being a Steelers’,
Penguins’, and Pirates’ fan‘ ever since he
was a kid growing up in Dallas, Texas.

Was there ever any doubt that Mills
would end up at Pitt? t

Mills, a senior economics major who
was recently elected the new president of
the College Republicans, originally came to
the University of Pittsburgh in 1993 to play

'I'I-IE PI'l'l' NEWS

for the men’s tennis team. He played for
two years until the team was out after the
conclusion of his sophomore year.

“I remember, we had just came back
from the Big East Championships, and we
all left for home,” said Mills. ‘Then, about
a month later, the coach called to tell us the
team was being cut by the athletic pro-

99

Several of his teammates thought

, about transferring to other schools, but not

Mills.

“I never thought about leaving.
Actually, I was kind of glad that the team
was cut because it gave me more time to
become involved with the College
Republicans,” he said.

Mills joined the College Republicans

during his junior year and soon became the
public relations director for the group.
Within a year, he was elected to the organi-
zation’s highest oﬂice — president.

This year, he volunteered for several
candidates, including Bill Ravotti and Tim
Murphy. He also spent 13 hours working
for Dave Fawcett on Election Day at
Baldwin High School in the South Hills.

“I stood outside the polls most of the
day holding a sign encouraging people to
vote for Fawcett,” Mills said. “One lady
looked up at me, went in to vote and when
she came out, she said, ‘I just voted for your
guy. Now, who is he?’’’ ,

Another way Mills inﬂuenced voters
was by his regular editorials in The Pitt
News. He said it gave him a chance to voice

his opinion about issues confronting the
candidates, but also an outlet to publicize
the College Republicans. However, once
elected president, Mills could no longer
write editorials for the paper.

Mills has also attended several confer-
ences with the College Republicans, includ-
ing the Pennsylvania Pro Life and Young
America Conferences. While at these con-
ferences, he was amazed at the involvement
of younger Americans in politics today.

“A girl approached me at the Young
America Conference,” said Mills, “and told
me about a group she was starting in
Washington, D.C. to lower taxes. Then she
told me that she was 15. I just thought,
‘What have I been doing with my life?’”

He plans on making up for all the time
he has lost, starting next ‘semester as the
new president of the College Republicans.

Mills said he wants to get several
Republican speakers to visit Pitt next year,
including United States Senator Rick
Santorum.

He would also like to work with other
political groups on campus, especially the
University Democrats, to set up debates on
current events and issues. He said he hopes
to build astronger relationship between the
College Republicans and other political

' organizations.

Even though Mills had a successful
election year, the Republican party was not
so lucky. .

‘‘I definitely believe that Dole had a
chance, and I thought that Clinton’s nega-
tives were so big that he could not possibly
win. He is a total criminal,” Mills said.

Though Mills said the national results
upset him, he was extremely agitated by the
local outcomes.

“People don’t vote for the candidates
based on the issues; they just pull the
Democratic lever,” Mills said.

The Republican Party will come out
top in 2000, according to Mills. He would
like to see former Vice President Dan

Quayle in the competition for the presiden- 4

cy.

“Quayle is a good politician that was
trashed by the press. He really has some
good ideas,” he said. “Once we get “Slick
Willy” out of office, the whole Democratic
Party will go down.” '

Besides looking forward to the next
election year, Mills is also looking to grad-
uate in April. He plans on attending gradu-
ate school at the University of Texas. After
graduate school, he hopes to have a suc-
cessful career in politics.

“I hope I can ﬁght the urge of going
straight into politics. I know the opportuni-
ty will be there, but I want to finish my edu-

cation ﬁrst,” Mills said.

Mills would also like to continue his
involvement with the College Republicans
while at the University of Texas and said he
hopes to keep changing the face of
American government.

“I see where this country is going and
it is not good. I have to get involved, make
a change, or it is my fault,” Mills said.

With names like President
Clinton and Vice—President Al Gore
on the list, Rob Frank has met with
some pretty important people in the
past few years, even though he
doesn’t like how his pictures with
them came out.

He is the acting vice—president
of the University Democrats, which
is a position that allows him to meet
and work with many of today’s
Democratic candidates.

Frank, a junior public adminis-
tration major, has the unique dis-
tinction of having politics as a
hobby and a career ambition.

When asked recently to become
the 4th Ward Neighborhood
Coordinator, which includes Pitt’s
campus, for Mayor Murphy in next
year’s election, Frank accepted that
responsibility with open arms,

“That work starts now,” said

Frank. “I will begin looking at the
statistics from the recent elections,
and create a field plan from that
information.”
I Frank has been involved with 65
different political campaigns during
his life, and enjoys working with
Mayor Murphy in particular.

He met Murphy in 1988 when
both started working together on
Michael Dukakis’ campaign for
president. Since then he has helped
the mayor in each of his past elec-
tions.

Frank is looking forward to the
closeness between the campaigners
working on the upcoming mayoral
primary and election. “I enjoy
working with Mayor Murphy
because it’s like a family in his
campaign,” he said.‘

But at first, Frank’s parents
weren’t very happy about the idea
of their son entering the world of
politics. He said with the upsurge of
nasty political campaigns and
“mud—slinging,” politics not only
became a dirty word in today’s soci-
ety, but in his household as well.

“Sometimes I wonder if they
would have been happier if I was a
bank robber,” joked Frank. “But
they went along with the idea of me
being involved in these campaigns.”

Not only is Frank a political
activist, he also spends time work-
ing in the billing department of the
city’s emergency medical service.
On top of that, he’s also is the edi-
tor and publisher of The South Hills
Journal, a newspaper that focuses
on Brookline and surrounding com-
munities.

He said time management is one
key to his success. With the recent
elections it was even more impor-

tant to schedule his jobs and school-
work, trying. to squeeze in a few
moments for them at every opportu-
nity. “I’ve been doing school work
on my lunch breaks,” he said.

He said he feels his dedication
to local campaigns and campus
action has paid off because of the
increase in Democratic student vot-
ing at the Forbes Quad location dur-
ing this past election.

“There was an upsurge of stu-
dent voting at Pitt,” said Frank.
“And I think that increase can be
attributed to the work the
University Democrats [did].”

He said he was adamant about
getting students to vote, and getting

college students more involved in
politics. He said he still believes
that one person can make a differ-
ence, and also gives credence to the
old adage: “Democracy is not a
spectator sport.”

Frank has also used his political
contacts to bring many Democratic
candidates to speak at Pitt’s campus
at his organization’s meetings.

In 1998, Frank is also consider-
ing running for Democratic State
Committee, which helps support
Democratic state officials. It would
not be the first time holding politi-
cal office for Frank, he has been a
delegate for Paul Tsongas and Tom
Harkin in past Democratic conven-

tions.

“I want to be able to say that I
achieved all I could,” said Frank. “I
want to be able to look back way
down the road and be happy about
what I did.”

"This grant is a modest amount of
money which will enable me to hire an addi-
tional researcher and the necessary supplies
for their experiments,” Ball said.

According to him, a lab with over 20
people and their supplies would cost over a
million dollars. Ball’s lab currently has two
postdoctoral fellows and two technicians.

Charity work is not a new concept for
Lernieux. For years, he donated his time to
visiting children in and out of hospitals, and
working with organizations forsick children,
such as the Make—A—VV1sh Foundation.

In addition to his charity efforts, he
became the honorary chairman for fundrais-
ing at the UPCI, three years before his diag-
nosis of Hodgkin’s disease. '

‘This represents the most direct contri-
bution for the UPCI. It is very ﬁtting for him
to be donating money to further the under-
standing of the disease he was alfected by,”
said Ronald Herberman, director ‘of the
UPCI and vice chancellor of Research
Health Sciences.

According to Ball, cancer may replace
heart disease as the number one killer in the
early part of the next century. He said that
there will bean estimated 1.35 million new
cancer cases in 1996. .

What makes battling cancer so tough is
the lack of knowledge about the disease.
Even though Hodgkin’s disease is not the

mystery it. once was, it still holds a few

secrets, like why it is most often seen in
young people aged 15 to 34 and in people
over the age of 55, but not in people aged 35
to 54.

Another puzzling aspect of cancer
research is why a patient goes into remission,
then has a relapse of the disease. According
to Ball, researchers do well with the early
stages of cancer, but it’s cancer in the late
stages that is hard for them to cure.

“We don’t know how to prevent it,” said
Ball. “All cancer treatments are pretty crude
because you’re using drugs to poison cells

that are dividing. In Hodgkin’s research, _

we’re working on methods to enhance the
immune system’s own attack against cancer,
which could lead to altemative therapies.
This might become a therapy for someone
with a relapse of cancer.”

Ball said that there has been progress in
cancer research. Today, about 80 percent of

newly diagnosed Hodgkin’s disease patients
will survive, a ﬁgure that was inconceivable
25 years ago when it was uniformly fatal.
"Ihe funding that has occurred in the
past has lead to this very dramatic turn
around,” said Herberman. “But research is
very expensive, and the labs are dependent
on the individual grants and federal f1md—
mg.”
The UPCI uses the funding from private
donations and individual grants, like the one
from the Lernieux Foundation, to start new,
or pilot projects. If they are successful, they
can receive federal funding to further the
research. ’ -
In any research setting, the amount of
funding they receive plays a part in the
advances the researchers make. According

Wednesday, December 4, ‘I996

to Herberman, that’s why makes grants are
important. ' g .

“Besides the money itself, it’s very help-
ful having Mario lend his name to the UPCI.
It puts a spotlight on the work we’re doing,
which helps in acquiring more research dol-
lars,” Herbennan said.

One of the reasons Lernieux started the
foundation was the large expense cancer
research often required.

“I saw how fortunate I was to be able to
play the greatest game in the world  and
have the ﬁnancial ﬁeedom to do the things I
like,” said Lemieux. “But what about the
people who are not as fortunate? I felt that I
had to give something back to the commu-
nity, and this is when I decided to form the
Lemieux Foundation.”

Beer, wine, liquor: it’s lalljusl
an advertisement for alcohol

Liquor: the hard stuff, vodka, cognac, whiskey, rum,
the green stuff, the blue stuff. Heck, it’s Christmas, don’t
forget the eggnog. Whatever you call it, Representative
Joe Kennedy (D-Massachusetts) says liquor should not be
advertised on T.V. 

Isn’t that a strange statement coming from a man
whose grandfather made big bucks peddling whiskey and
whose uncle is the most public drinker on the Hill? They
made their choices, why can’t we make ours?

However, beer and wine are already advertised, and
so it seems a rather dubious distinction to make. After all,
each contains alcohol — the substance Congress is trying
to regulate. Though the concentration. differs between
liquor, beer, and wine, the effects are the same. As we all
learned in ninth grade health class (or perhaps AA if you
missed that lesson), one 12—ounce can of beer equals one
glass of wine, which in turn equals one shot of hard
liquor. P

Yes, we know all about alcohol abuse, irresponsible
consumption, drunken drivers, and the whole nine yards.

However, we believe in the ability of the vast majority of »

adults who choose to drink to do so in a moderate and
responsible fashion. One way to increase. awareness of
alcohol and its effects is through experience and perhaps
even advertising.

We don’t appreciate the possibility of Washington
deciding that we are too stupid to make these informed
choices for ourselves, that we can somehow handle the
spectacle of Budweiser’s friendly frogs without becom-
ing morally depraved alcoholics; but we can’t take the
idea of watching a St. Bernard frolic through the snow
with a ﬂask of brandy around its neck.

What is possible and desirable is that all adults be
educated and informed in order to make sensible choices.
Perhaps the government should be a little more concerned
with education, and a little less concerned with prohibi-
tion.

Talkin’ university bureaucracy blues

 

Wow, it’s here. The last week
of school. How did Ieget here? Is
this my beautiful house? No, it’s
just FINALS week You know what
that means: all-nighters, all-dayers,
and long lines at the printers. Unless
you are a science major, of course,
in which case all you have to do is
know everything in 12 voluminous
chapters of a book that weighs more
than you do. Oh, is that all! So, true
to the finals tradition of never doing
today what you can put off ‘til
tomorrow, I will digress from my
studies and write about something
completely dilferent.

I would just like to get in a
quick little 10 cents worth here
about the University schedule
which is, naturally, completely
retarded. I’ll get this over with
quickly, but here is the essential list:
1) We start school midweek right
before Labor Day, which means the
first Monday classes don’t start for
two weeks. 2) We have
Thanksgiving break right before
Christmas. Solution? Start later,
break middler, and end later. What’s
that you say? Too simple to ever
come true at the second—rate
University of Pittsburgh. \

Luckily, I don’t have much
respect for ratings systems and
labels; life always turns out to be so
much more than the sum of its parts.
Otherwise I would be weeping into
my books as I thought of all the
work I have done, earning my
degree in the silent watches of the
night, staying home sober when all
the world is out PARTYING except
ME, and all for what? A second—rate
degree at a second-rate university?
Excuse me, but I beg to differ. I am
not second—rate, and neither is my
degree. However, on the topic of

ratings...

The University, as pointed out
in Sunday’s PG, is a major resource
for this (second—rate) city. The
young people attending one of the
three major schools ‘bring much
“vitality” to the oldest population in
the United States of America.
Unfortunately, the city of Pittsburgh

. is too second—rate to care about nur-

turing this resource. lnstead, they
prefer blowing stale air about the
lousy sports teams and the ugly
‘cheap stadium and the hideously
ugly and hideously expensive new
jail. I guess that extra $60 million
from the state to the Department of
Corrections had to be spent some-
how, and just let the students pay
the 4.5 percent tuition hike out of
the princely sums they can get from
the state. It costs approximately $28
thousand dollars a year to keep a
felon in his Riverside apartment,
but the most students can get for a
state grant is $2,300 per year. Gee, I
wonder why Pittsburgh is a second-
rate city with a second—rate univer-
sity.

The University is a great
resource, but it has been very badly
managed. Every department and
sub—departrnent has WAY too much
red tape and bureaucracy hanging
like a millstone around its neck. For
example, the Opinions Goddess of
this paper was at Hillman Library
this morning at 8:30 a.m. She found
her way to the Media Resources
room and started using PittCat. The

Opinions Goddess was minding her

own business in the early morning
peace, paging down the search cat-
egories, when a man (neo-Nazi dis-
guised as librarian) came up behind
her, yelling that the department was
not open yet. After a long and
tedious discussion which estab-
lished ﬁrm boundaries between the

diverse departments of -Media

Resources, Media Services, and
Hillman Library itself, the Opinions
Goddess was ejected from MR and
sent off with her tail between her
legs until 10 a.m., which apparently
is oﬂicial opening time. Now, how
stupid is this? It’s ﬁnals week, a stu-
dent is in the building, using the
equipment (which is‘ up and run-
ning), but because one side of the
room “opens” an hour and halflater
than the other half  whatever.

Now this tale of wasted efforts, I

wasted time, and unnecessary trips
hither and thither is sadly typical of
the way this University “runs.” Our
previous chancellor was keen on

/, raising the image of the University,
he said, and commenced to spend
millions upon himself, his house,
and his office. Thankfully he is
gone, with his beefed—up resume
(wham barn thank you Pitt) on its
way to, as it happens, a ﬁrst—rate
institution — the Smithsonian.
There is no justice. Of course, we
already knew this (Gammage being
the most recent and local debacle
that comes to mind); however, it
doesn’t mean we find it any easier
to take when ‘it’s rubbed in our
faces. '

And the other thing that I want
to say on this topic, having
slammed the city and University for
not putting a business—like‘p1iority
on good education, is that frankly,
the country itself is one day going to_
regret its preference for spending
huge sums on the so—called criminal
justice system and leaving educa-
tion to like it or lump it. As a non-
native observer of this culture, it has
struck me on occasion that this
country is little like our ex—chancel-
lor: real big on appearances and just
a little short on form.

There are two modes of thinking
and two ways of looking at everything.
One is the scientific mode which
involves underlying structure and func-
tion. The opposite and complementary
mode of thinking is often called the
romantic mode. It involves emotion,
impression, and intuition. Many see one
mode as more valid than the other.
However, I think that much can be
gained from realizing that they are
equally valid.

There is underlying structure to just
about everything. Even music, which is
touted as anartistic outlet, can be broken
down into scientiﬁc relationships and
structure. Certain notes sound good
together, and certain notes do not.
Computers can create some pretty amaz-
ing compositions when all or some of
the rules of music theory are pro-
grammed into them. Music is a language
with rules and functions much like math-
ematics, but to think entirely in this man—
ner is a mistake. It minimizes the emo-
tion involved and expressed in music.
When music is reduced to a set of rules
and random notes within those rules, it
becomes more of a game than an art.
There is, however, something to be
gained by the scientiﬁc interpretation of

THE PITT NEWS

music. Artists who gauge playing mere-
ly on emotion, with little or no music
theory, can not create as complex and
interesting-sounding music as those who
incorporate theory into their work. But
one must remember that on the other
hand, music without emotion (i.e. music
totally based on structure) loses one of
the most valuable properties we value in
a good piece of music. By exploiting
both modes of thought for what they are
useful for, one can   
transcend the ordi-
nary and create some-
thing truly amazing,
on both the structural
and emotional levels.
Modern western
medicine is another
good example of
where these two
modes of thinking clash. Modern medi—
cine is based on the tenets of biology and
the underlying structure and function of
the human body. Eastern medicine (par-
ticularly in China) is based on the man-
aging of a universal spiritual energy
called Chi. Acupuncture and acupressure
are both proven viable methods of treat-
ment for many things. Western science
can try to explain away the effects of
these practices by saying that the pres-
sure points correspond with nerve end-
ings, etc. But we must remember that

   

Eastern science can do the same thing by
reversing the argument. As a human
race, we always try to explain away
other philosophies by giving them the
name of coincidence in our own person-
al reality. There is no real way to detect
the absolute truth of something. One can
only judge a philosophy or method by
how well it works. They both work well.
One can also beneﬁt from knowing
about both. In surgery cases in which the

- -    patient is allergic to
the anesthetics, there
is a ‘ place for
acupuncture treat-
ment. There are doc-
umented, proven
cases of brain and
dental surgery done
without anesthetic,
using only acupunc-
ture techniques to numb the patient.
There is no reason to‘ be prejudiced
against a certain philosophy or mode of
thinking just because it doesn’t jive with
ours. As long as it works, there’s no way
to tell who’s right and who’s wrong. The
only way of detecting if something is
valid is through experimentation. And
through experimentation, both ways are
valid. Once again, from knowing and
implementing both, one can transcend
the abilities of one or the other and per-
form what might be considered a med-

Logic and intuition: neither is complete without the other

ical miracle.

This merging of the two thought
processes is applicable to anything. In
Robert Pirsig’s book, “Zen and the Art
of Motorcycle Maintenance,” Pirsig
talks of this joining as something he
calls quality. Since absolute truth is a
rather squirrely entity, quality or useful-
ness is the best way to judge modes of
thought. He states that we are extremely
prejudiced about running down other

_ people’s ghosts when we are equally

superstitious and ignorant about our
own. By other people’s ghosts, he means
religion and romantic modes of thought,
and by ours he means science and the
scientific method. The point of the book
and this article is that we should elirni—

nate this prejudice and see both on an

equal level when pertaining to quality.
Most things can be explained in
terms of structure and scientiﬁc analysis,“
just as most things can be explained in
terms of mysticism and intuition.
Neither is complete, but one seems to
pick up where the other leaves off. The
key is to see these for what they are:
approximations of true reality, which we
as humans may" never see. Our only tool
for refining our personal reality is judg-
ment based on quality and usefulness.
Jay DeMartino thinks that philosophy is
one of the best and most eﬂective pro-
crastination tools ever invented.

Something tells me it's time to get the heck out of Dodge

  

Although the presidential
election is over, I am still skeptical
as to what the future holds. Were
people pressing buttons and
pulling levers for the country or
for their health? AmeriKKKa
chose its big cheese, and I still feel
like we walked into a, trap. The
entire political process has the
nose—wrinkling stench of a bad
action—adventure movie. I
remember how it all began.

My journey begins in early
‘96. I am assigned to bring home
a competent president to America.
I am warned to beware of power-
ful forces threatening to control
the country for their own greedy
gains: General Gingrich Zod, and
his American Contracts, Money
Man Forbes, and Perot the
Ghostface Mercenary.

Through my expedition, I am
tracked and attacked by savage
Democrat and Republican tribes,
yielding blowguns and issue-
tipped darts. I am held captive for
months, being fed poisonous pro-
paganda. They worship holy ani-
mal symbols like the donkey and
elephant. The haunting rhythms

of tiibal drums and saxophones
rise over the village, thumping
and tooting the war cries of “Dole

Man” and “America the
Beaut' .”
I am brought before the high ,

priests, Clinton and Dole. I recog-
nize them from early secret files.
They are actually traveling rr1agi—
cians whose plane crashed long
ago in the deepest part of the
"media jungle.

Now, they are masquerading
as prophets. They dazzle the
natives with magical metaphors
and promises. “Behold as we bal-
ance the budget and cut taxes.”
The natives watch as Clinton and
Dole make social programs disap-
pear, striking fear into their strug-
gling hearts.

But -they each crave total
power. Gathering their political
forces, they wage war against
each other. Innocent bodies are
caught in the crossfire, including
myself.

Just when it seems like the
mission will be a failure, a Tarzan-
like yell is heard from Texas. Like
the hero who comes just in the
nick of time, Perot the mercenary
has come to save me. He swings

from the money tree into battle,
tossing $100 grenades. But, being
a mercenary, he is ultimately out

for hirrrself. He too wants the

power. But he has no game plan.

- Under the clouds- of confu-
sion, Imake my escape. I gain
some distance and set up traps to
slow them down. But they are
swift and agile, dodging welfare
refonn and affrrrnative action vine
slings. Clinton and. Dole hurdle
tax reform issues like Olympic
track stars, and despite their
obscure differences, combine to
keep Perot a distant third.

I reach a clearing and cast my
eyes skyward. Over the horizon
of TV and newspaper trees, I can
see a sign in bright red neon
lights. It says, “Vote Here.” My
mission is almost complete. But I
am tired of being chased. I can’t
keep running away. I must face
them here.

I turn to see them walk slow-
ly into the clearing. Showdown.
Wah—aah—Wah—ah-aaahhh, Wah-
wah-waaahhh. I jump back into a
karate kid crane stance as they
approach. They hesitate.

“Alright, you want me? Try
to take me, punks,” I say.

They charge me. But with
lightening speed I strike back.
‘What do you plan to do about
public schools? Student loans?
Health care? What community
programs will be out? What are
my chances of having a job when
I graduate?”

I knock Perot out with the
first blow. Dole blocks and ducks
the issues, but he too soon falters.
I ask, “How do you plan to handle
gun control?” '

“Well, Clinton hasn’t done
his job.”

I didn’t ask him about
Clinton, so I shot him.

Clinton is more tricky, more
cunning. The force is strong in
him. He blinds me with his sly fox
smile and uses soothing words to
clog my hearing. “I am like you. I
am one of you. I am your friend.
Here, have a McNugget.” He’s
sharp. He’s strong like the head
honcho at the end of a video
game.

But soon I peep his tech-
nique. He looks good, sounds
good, and gives a good speech.
He’s telling me what he thinks I
want to hear. He’s going for my
senses and my emotions.

I step back and pull out a
scarf and ear plugs. I insert the ear
plugs, put the scarf around my
eyes and tie it tightly. He can’t get
to me now. I use my nose to sniff
him out. There’s a strong B.S.
smell to what he’s saying. I con-
nect with a good stiff left jab to his
eye. I take off the blindfold in
time to see him hitting the ground.
I turn and dash for the sign.

I have reached. my destina-
tion, the voting booth. I open the
curtains and am confronted by
names. A ghostly voice suddenly
speaks. “You must choose wisely,
my son.” As if I was picking out
the true Holy Grail among the
phonies, I scan the names.

But something doesn’t feel
right. I spot the names Clinton and
Dole. This feels like a set up. Just
before I pull a lever, the ghostly
voice turns to evil guy chuckles. I
jump back and look around hys-
terically. I hear a rumbling sound.
I stick my head through the cur-
tains just in time to see the large
boulder come thundering towards
me.

Theron C. Warren believes that no
matter who was chosen, we were
doomed from the beginning.

Tis the season
to be greedy

 

The holiday season is upon us.
Whatever your faith, this time of year
stands for peace on Earth, goodwill toward
your fellow human beings, and 20 percent
off sales at participating Lazarus locations.

As far as the sports world is concerned,
this is the season of rest. College football
won’t heat up until New Year’s. Hockey
and basketball are just starting. The NFL is
preparing for its second season. The closest-
thing a big—ticket game between now and
Christmas is either the Broncos-Packers
wind-chill thriller this weekend or Michael
Jordan vs. the aliens in Space Jam.

So who comes to the fans’ rescue?

‘Easy —- the blooper collection that is off-

season baseball dealings. Think of it as The
Three Stooges Meet Bud Selig.

Owner Jerry Reinsdorf made the first
big splash, hours after leading a successful
owner veto of their own labor agreement.
He took his Chicago White Sox gold card to
Cleveland, and plunked down $55 million
for the loony bin’s poster boy, Albert Belle.
Strangely, after his shopping trip was over,
Reinsdorf dropped his opposition to the
labor deal. It passed.

Sound ﬁshy? Reinsdorf gets a stand-
packing homerun hitter, and everybody else
gets labor peace. Not only are the lunatics
running the asylum, but the lunatic in
charge is the one that signed a psycho,
corked—bat—using, kid—chasing, reporter-
cursing outﬁelder to a multi—year contract.

Well, not technically. The ofﬁcial
lunatic in charge is Selig, affectionately
termed “Acting Commissioner for Life” by
more than one baseball beat writer. He set a
Nov. 15 deadline for the labor talks to reach
a successful conclusion in order to preserve
interleague play.

Interleague play, the bastard child of
owner greed and a perceived lack of fan
interest, was all set to go this season.
Baseball purists were all set to leap off the
green monster or impale themselves on one
of the Yankee Stadium monuments.

Then, a funny thing happened — the

Pitt gets Cosby kid and more

Mike Kovak

Although Pitt’s men’s
and women’s basketball
teams are struggling, both
Ralph Willard and Kirk
Bruce continue to sure up
their respective chances by
assembling solid recruiting
classes during the early sign-
ing period.

For the second time in
three years, Willard has
assembled one of the top
recruiting classes in the
country.

The men’s coach
announced the signing of
five new recruits to national
letters—of—intent during the
NCAA’s early—signing peri-
od which ran from Nov. 13
to Nov. .20. Some people
rank the early recruit corp in
the top 10 in the country.

Pitt’s ﬁve new recruits
are Attila Cosby, a 6—foot-9,
220-pound forward from tra-
ditional power Oak Hill

(Va.) Academy; John
Finneman, a 6-foot-6 long-
range specialist from

Fairfax, Va.; Stephen Flores,
a 6—foot-8 forward from East
Liverpool, Ohio; Ricardo
Greer, a 6-foot-4, 225—pound
guard from New York City;
and Chris Seabrooks, a 6-

’ foot—9, 215-pound forward

from Macon, Ga.

with the recruits we signed
in the early signing period,”
said Willard. “We feel the
class will strongly add to the
foundation of our basketball
program at the University of
Pittsburgh.”

Cosby may be the jewel
of the class. He was Oak
Hills’ second—leading scorer
last season, averaging 10.4
points, 6.4 rebounds, and 2.2
blocks per game. He’s con-
sidered the top player in
Virginia and a top 50

prospect nationally.
Finneman ranks number

two in Virginia. He averaged

19 points and six boards a

. game last year at Woodson

High School.

Greer is one of the big-
ger guards in the nation. He
averaged 30 points a game
in this year’s Big Time
Tournament at Las Vegas,
the highest average by any
player in the tournament.
Flores likes to drop bombs
from downtown despite his

\

6—foot-8 stature.

Seabrooks hails from
the same hometown as Pitt’s
Vonteego Cummings, and he
averaged 15 points, 10
rebounds, and two blocks a
game at Northeast High
School.

What could bolster this
class even further would be
the signing of top 10
prospect Ryan Humphrey,
whose brother, Rod, plays
football for Pitt. Some publi-
cations rank Humphrey as
the second best player in the
country.

Women’s Head Coach
Kirk Bruce announced the
signing of three high school
seniors to national letters—of-
intent to enroll at Pitt next
fall. Monique Toney, a 5-
foot-4 point guard from
Yorba. Linda, Ca.;
Rasheeddah Akram, a 5-
foot—1O guard from Delmar,
Md; and Kenosha Chastang,
a 6-foot-4 forward/center
from Columbus, Ohio all
have signed with Pitt.

Toney averaged 13
points, seven assists, five
steals, and three rebounds
per game during her junior
season. Akram averaged 38
points, 19 rebounds, five
steals and five assists per
game in 1995-96. Chastang
pumped in 17 points and 12
rebounds.

breathed a heavy sigh of relief —— we would be
saved the agony of a Twins-Pirates series (atten-
dance in the hundreds) for yet another year. Selig
was ﬁnally taking charge.

When the new deal was signed, however, the
commish backed off. Interleague play is still on the
table, and could very well have a sacrilegious debut
this season, sometime in June.

Is Selig a liar, or simply spineless? No one

4 knows for sure. Maybe he just hasn’t ﬁgured out

how to use a calendar yet.

. Speaking of unsound business moves, the
National League Owner of the Off-Season has to
be Bill Giles of the Philadelphia Phillies. His ﬁrst
move after the season ended was to ﬁre Jim
Fregosi, whose last good year came when John
Kruk was still active and Darren Daulton could
walk without a limp.

Not a bad move, especially when Larry Bowa

is on the payroll. The fonner Cubs and Padres skip-

per who used to beat up toilet bowls with baseball
bats after tough games was a natural for the Philly
scene. Giles immediately hired relatively unknown
Terry Francona to manage the team, and Bowa left
for Anaheim. A

Is it any wonder why Philadelphia fans care
more about what Ricky Watters ate for breakfast
than how the Phillies are doing? To top things off,
Giles let fan favorite and .361 hitter Jim Eisenreich
slip away to Jim Leyland’s Florida Marlins, and
signed journeyman Rex Hudler to pick up the
slack. And the owners can’t ﬁgure out why the fans
don’t show up.

Runner-up to Giles is Braves media mogul
Ted Turner. Turner is currently in the process of rip-
ping apart Olympic Stadium in Atlanta to make a

By the way, the new park is right next to

Olympic glory sometimes has to be sacriﬁced for

Champions, in the biggest city in the league, and
heir apparent to Wade Boggs as full—time third
sacker. If he prefers the opposite of the above con-
ditions, he should have stayed in Pittsburgh.

The only remaining reason, sad to say, is

1 money. With the new restrictions in the upcoming

labor deal, Hayes must think the Bronx is ﬁlled
with too many stars for him to make enough
dough. Even though he’s under contract to the
Yankees, he won’t play for them due to his pro-
jected earnings. It’s like the game has been taken
over by stockbrokers.

After every season stops, the national pastime

digs itself into bigger and bigger holes. We can /

only hope‘ that sanity" will reign someday.

Until then, see you all at Lazarus. Sale ends
soon.
Kevin Lilley is a columnist for The Pitt News and
picked Matt Cavanaugh as Pitts next head coach
months ago.

Hockey

over Hartford.

Pens’ Head Coach Ed
Johnston made some happy faces
when he put Mario Lemieux, Ron
Francis, and Jaromir Jagr on the
same line entering last weekend.
Jagr, the NHL Player of the Month
for November, responded with a
his second hat trick of the season in
the harpooning of the Whalers on
Saturday.

Still, Hartford surprisingly
remains in a ﬁrst-place tie with the
Buffalo Sabres atop the division.
With only a plus-two goal differen-
tial and a 6-8-1 road record, how-
ever, critics don’t give this New
England team much more of a
chance. Sean Burke, Keith
Primeau, and the rest of the
Whalers are doing their very best
thus far to prove them wrong.

Philadelphia hopes its chances
of better play increase in the near
future with last week’s return of
Eric Lindros. The Flyers’ captain
has registered two assists thus far in
his ﬁrst four games back. Philly, at
14-12-1, are two games above .500
for the ﬁrst time this season.

The New York Rangers (10-
13-4) recently moved three games
closer to that feat. Mark Messier,
the NHL Player of the Week, led
the “Broadway Bombers” with ﬁve
goals in the undefeated Ranger
week (3-0), and look as if —they’re

 

ready to make their move to the top '

of the Atlantic. Gretzky, who
notched his 3,000th career point in
Sunday’s win over Montreal, will
need to step up his play as well.

At 16-8-1, the Dallas Stars are
already on top. The Stars have been
possibly one of the biggest surpris-
es of the season, leading the Central
since the start of the ‘96—’97 carn-
paign.

It’s not surprising to see that
the Colorado Avalanche (16-6-4)
continued from where they left off
in June. Joe Sakic and Peter
Forsberg lead the league with 11
goals and 25 assists each.

Goaltender Patrick Roy, ﬁrst in
the NHL with 15 wins, has been on
ﬁre lately. Roy has won eight of his
last 11 and boasted a 1.62 goals-
against-average for November.

' So there are still plenty of
questions to be answered with over
50 games to go this season:

Will Pittsburgh and the
Rangers rally? Can the Whalers
hold onto a playoff spot? Are the
Florida Panthers for real?

And of course - how many
more games will the Avalanche
win en route to another Stanley
Cup run? Or can they be stopped?

These and many other ques-
tions will be answered in the world
we call the National Hockey
League.

THE PI'I'I' NEWS

Wednesday, December 4, I 996

Boo hoo, the Steelers
are hurting in The Pitt

from local and wire services

Football

- The Pittsburgh Steelers had expected
Greg Lloyd, Carnell Lake, Ray
Seals, Chad Brown, Yancey
Thigpen, and Mark Bruener to lead
them back to the Super Bowl. The
problem now is that all of these play-
ers are injured. Coach Bill Cowher is
hoping the replacements can at least
get his team a week off at playoff
time. Pittsburgh, Buffalo, and Kansas
City are fighting for second place in
the conference with identical 9-4
records.

° There’s a chance John Elway will
sit out Denver’s game at Green Bay
this Sunday. The Broncos’ quarter-
back is still nursing a pulled ham-
string, and Coach Mike Shanahan
says if the muscle is sore and tight he
won’t play Elway. Shanahan has the
luxury of resting his top players as the
12-1 Broncos have wrapped up home-
field advantage throughout the play-
offs.

Broncos offensive tackle Gary

Zimmerman will miss the Packers
game. after undergoing arthroscopic
surgery on his shoulder.
0 Another quarterback for the New
York Jets. What they really need, sev-
eral players say, is a change in atti-
tude.

Glenn Foley is in for Frank
Reich, who was in for Neil
O’Donnell. Foley will make his first
NFL start Sunday at New England.

- The Baltimore Ravens area bust on
the road — with opposing fans. When

the Ravens come to town, attendance

has dropped at each stadium.
Baltimore played before the smallest
crowds of the season in Pittsburgh,
Houston, Denver, Jacksonville, and
San Francisco.
College Football
- Lou Holtz might have coached his
last game at Notre Dame. The
Fighting Irish were officially taken
out of the running for an alliance
bowl, and the school’s athletics direc-
tor says they won’t accept bids from
the Copper or Independence Bowl.
What killed the Irish’s chance of get-
ting‘ in the Sugar, Fiesta, or Orange
Bowl was Saturday’s overtime loss to
Southern Cal. Notre Dame is 8-3 and
has dropped to 18th in the AP top 25.

A couple of other teams are mak-
ing plans for the postseason. West
Virginia has been invited to the Gator
Bowl to face North Carolina, and
Miami will take on Virginia in the
CarQues.t Bowl.

News Sports Briefing

- It appears Nebraska will have to play
the Big 12 Championship game with-
out its top tailback. Coach Tom
Osbourne says a foot injury will like-
ly keep Ahman Green out of
Saturday’s game against Texas.
Reserves Damon Benning. and
Deangelo Evans are also hurting.
Camps

- Kent State University will once
again be conducting the Rick
Rembielak Baseball Skills Clinics.
This winter they’ll belholding five
clinics which include a pitching and

catching clinic, a hitting clinic, an

overﬂow clinic for pitching and hit-
ting, a parent/child clinic, and a
infield defense clinic.

The clinics are open to campers
eight to 18 years of age, including

graduating seniors. The clinics will be -

instructed by the Kent baseball coach-
ing staff and team.

The first camp will be held from
Jan. 4-5. The second will take place
from Feb. 1-2. For further details call
the Kent baseball office at (330) 672-
3696.

Basketball
- You won’t want to miss out on the

amazing athleticism and non-stop

entertainment; it’s basketball with a
spin, Globetrotter style.

Tickets went on sale Friday, Nov.
29 for Pittsburgh’s only appearance of
the 1997 Harlem Globetrotters World
Tour. Known as the most recognized,
most popular, and most revered bas-
ketball team in the world, the Harlem
Globetrotters are suiting up for an all-
star performance at the Pittsburgh
Civic Arena Friday, Dec. 27 at 7:30

p.m.
Baseball

0 It appears Shawon Dunston’s heart
was left in Chicago —— not San

Francisco. After playing one season
for the Giants, the 33-year-old short-
stop is returning to the Cubs after
agreeing to a one-year contract worth
$2 million.

Dunston spent the first 11 years of
his big-league career with the Cubs
before signing with San Francisco last
January.

- Sid Fernandez has a new address.
After spending the last two seasons in
Baltimore and Philly, the left-hander
agreed yesterday with the Houston
Astros to a one—year deal heavy with
incentives. The 34-year-old Fernandez
was 3-6 last season with a 3.43 ERA.

The Astros also signed infielders
Pat Listach and Bill Spiers to one-
year contracts.
