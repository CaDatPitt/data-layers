Campus police expand to improve efficiency

By Steve Kozarovich
Asst. News Editor

Campus police is fulfilling its plans for
expansion by adding more patrols and beat
officers to its Oakland forces.

The new officers and patrols are the
result of a plan to reduce costs but provide
better services which has been in the works
for almost two years, according to Director
of Public Safety Gary Moses.

“This is basically a real pro-active change
of the department to become more visible
and service the university community."

Moses said.

Other changes included a reassessment
of the beats in Oakland and hiring civilians
in order to move uniformed officers into
the streets.

In October 1993, Moses said the
Department of Public Safety looked over all
the Oakland beats which later led to a read-
justment of the number of officers in certain
beats.

A new beat officer has been assigned to
cover the area between University Drive
and Fifth Avenue. A foot patrol officer has
also been added to the already car-

Republicans in the back room of

“As conservatives  everything that the
world knows about conservatism, they are
told by liberals,” said Quinn. “We arm our-

patrolled area around Trees Hall. the Cost
Center and Pitt Stadium. according to
Moses.

Moses said that recently one campus offi-
cer retired and two new ones were hired
because of the lower starting pay for new
officers.

The department also hired civilians to fill
the communications jobs in the Department
of Public Safety so that the uniformed offi-
cers who previously held those positions
could be patrolling the streets rather than
sitting at a desk.

“Conservatives are depicted as cruel, cold
and uncaring, the rich people. A lot of that
is multiculturalism,” Quinn said. “The basic
mistake of the multiculturalist is confusing
the dominant culture with white skin.”
According to Quinn, racism still exists
amidst the white community, however to
be a conservative “doesn’t have to mean the

that American culture is still accessible.”

Quinn also said that one of the biggest
problems that the conservatives must coin-
bat is the rewriting of the 19805 by the
Democrats.

“The 805 were not the decade of greed.
Greed is when you take something that
doesn’t belong to you,” said Quinn.

Help save the environment while earning internship credits

ByJ.M. Gonzalez
For The Pitt News

In today’s job market, experi-
ence is becoming a necessity.
The Student Conservation
Association has over a thousand
environmental internships avail-
able that can provide experi-
ence as well as fun.

The program is a nonprofit

organization that was founded
37 years ago by Elizabeth Titus.
Her interest was in environmen-
tal science but at that time geol-
ogy was a more established
subject, so she concentrated on
it. She later founded the Student
Conservation Association.

The SCA Resource Assistant
Program can place any interest-
ed person in a field that they

choose. A person is assigned to
work alone or with another per-
son experienced in the environ-
mental profession.

Christina Copeland is a
recruiter for the program as well
as a resource assistant. She
became involved in SCA when a
friend of hers returned from an
Alaskan internship.

Some of Copelands areas of

experience include interpreta-
tion or documentation work,
environmental education, and
wildlife photography.

The program often works
with federal resource agencies
such as the National Park
Service, U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service, and the US Navy's
Natural Resources Program.

Copeland said that many of

the positions offered require
"motivated people” in the posi-
tion. The position is a volunteer
internship that includes free
housing plus an allowance for
food and other necessities.

The person working in the
area, whether it is a national
park or refuge, is often the only
person the public can commu-

and added, “Teaching is corn-
posed of two things. You must
be able to teach the technical
aspects of the subject and be
able to put it in a modern per-
spective for the students.”

David Pratt, a chemistry pro-
fessor since 1968, was another
recipient of the teaching award.

“It’s one of the nicest things
that ever happened to me,”
Pratt said.

Pratt was recognized for his
creative use of laboratory
demonstrations and the depth
of his teaching, according to the

Office of Faculty Development.

“Fundamentally, my teaching
philosophy is to try and put
myself in the students’ shoes
[because] the secret to good
teaching is to find out what stu-
dents’ misconceptions are,”
Pratt said.

Blaise Champagne, a labora-
tory assistant who has worked
with Pratt for over six years,
spoke about his overall commit-
ment to the university.

“He’s a very good researcher
and a dynamic lecturer, and stu-
dents are very entertained by
him,” Champagne said.

was another Distinguished
Teaching Award winner.
Coffee was cited for her integral
role in researching and imple-
menting Pitt medical school's
new curriculum as well as her
time devoted to‘ students.

Coffee, who has been teach-
ing at Pitt for 20 years, can add
this award to her earlier
achievements which include the
Dean’s Award for Excellence in
Education.

She said the majority of her
students in the medical school
are already highly motivated,
but they still bring a challenge
for her.

“I try to make the teaching
fun, but also make sure the stu-
dents know they have a respon-
sibility,” Coffee said. ,

History and Women's Studies
department professor Maurine

-Greenwald was awarded the
chancellor’s honor due to her

commitment to teaching strate-
gies and her assistance to stu-
dents trying to reach their goals,
according to the faculty depart-
merit.

The only non—Oakland cam-
pus teacher to be honored with
the teaching award is Mark
McColloch, a history professor
at the Greensburg campus.

According to Dr. Don Reilly, a
colleague of McCo1loch’s at
Greensburg, the history teacher
is noted for his fine classroom
teaching and his enrichment of
the intellectual climate at the
school.

In addition to the teaching
awards, -five faculty members
were given Distinguished
Public Service Awards. The
award recognizes faculty for
outstanding achievement in
applying university and acade-
mic resources to address social
problems.

clothing,” said Quinn.

Quinn said that one
“cannot be an activist
president. The great thing
about Reagan is that he
didn’t try to micro-man-
age everything  [He
had] a very simple idea,
the need to open [eco-
nomic] doors. TlIat’s the
kind of president we
need to have.”

Quinn went on to state
that the Reagan legacy is
the "single biggest threat”
to liberalism. Liberal
ideas have failed every
single time, he said, refer-
ring to liberal economic

— plans.

Continuing on with his
attack on liberals, Quinn_
described liberals as hav-
ing a “snap-shot mentali-
ty,” referring to the social
and ecological issues.

“The ‘60s crowd is con-
vinced tlIat they can man-
age the world into a
Utopia," Quinn said.

Quinn concluded his
speech by saying that we
must let people have the
right to fail.

“Fairness has replaced
the pursuit of excellence.
When failure is nipping at
your heals, it’s amazing
what you can do,” said
Quinn.

Eric Lurie, president of
the College Republicans,
said, “He was fantastic.
He had the audience
mesmerized. He said
himself that he’s a former
liberal.”

W/alletng the heat makes things safer

With crime a consistent problem, the Department
of Public Safety has taken some laudable steps
toward dealing with threats to student safety.

By restructuring their force, campus police will be
able to put more officers on the street. Instead of
handling administrative duties, they will be able to
handle regular police work. Civilian workers will
take over tasks formerly performed by trained offi-
cers. These civilians have had over 160 hours of
training. In addition, some Pitt security guards are
being replaced by regular police officers. This is
because starting pay for police officers is less than
for security guards, and thus more officers could be
hired.

This represents an important trend in law enforce-
ment today. Everyone benefits from freeing officers

to perform their primary function in the community.’

One of the changes is reassessing beats and adding
foot patrols and bicycle patrols. There will also be an
extra patrol car with a sergeant available to handle
emergencies. V

These will provide an increased, visible police
presence which will add to the students’ sense of
safety.

Although Public Safety says this is not in response
to growing crime rates, crime still remains an impor-
tant concern. Students must be made aware of this
with additional safety seminars and self—defense
classes offered.

However, it must be remembered that the students
have a role to play in campus safety as well.

It is not solely up to the university to provide a safe
environment, students must also take the initiative to
learn how to protect themselves. Students should
make use of the safety seminars and defense classes
offered by the Department of Public Safety on a reg-
ular basis. According to Public Safety Director Gary
Moses, safety seminars can be tailored for any group
that would request one. _

Shuttles should be called whether walking three
blocks or three miles at night. I

It is reassuring to see the university taking realistic,
concrete steps to curb crime.

With a larger police presence, student safety will be
increased and hopefully crime will be deterred from
the area.

When the university begins to examine its budget,
it should keep in mind these practical approaches to
improving the campus community.

When it comes time to make budget cuts — as it
happens every year —- cuts in campus police and
safety funding should be considered out of bounds.

Cynical generation accelerated into future

Just as The Catcher in the Rye helped to define
the baby-boomer generation, Douglas
Coupland"s "Generation X (Tales for an
Accelerated Culture) is the modern-day counter-
part to J. D. Salinger’s classic novel. When
Coupland’s highly acclaimed novel came out in
1991, Rolling Stone declared it “captures the list-
lessness that accompanies growing up in today’s
info-laden culture.” The book’s blurb says that
Generation X is comprised of “...the generation
born in the late 1950s and 19605 —- a camera-
shy, suspiciously-hushed generation vaguely
known up to now as Twentysomething." First
off, you probably know this group, you’re most
likely a part of it. Secondly, I think we all owe
an enormous debt of gratitude to Mr. Coupland
for naming us “Generation X,”

sarcastic and pc.ssimistic. MTV thinks it's sup-
posed to be the reflector of pop culture, but
how many times have you heard someone decry
MTV as stupid, pointless, mindless, etc? Actually,
I’m guilty of this too, but I'll admit that I do
occasionally watch MTV. But of course, it’s only
to further my plan of eventually commandeering
this once-hip station so I can play the videos
that I deem interesting (I’d be destroying every
existing copy of “Thriller” and I’d start an R.E.M.
marathon on Sundays.) But, where does such an
attitude come from? Oh sure, it has some basis
in personal preference, but there’s more to it:

I think such statements indicate that even
among our fellow Twentysomethings, there is an
element of quasi-hostility. We’re not sure what it
Ls exactly, where it comes from or

us sound like the younger sib-
lings of the very-‘80s television

where it’s going. It might have its
origin in the greed of the 1980s,
which instilled a false sense of
security in the lives of many

Generation X is a very ‘90s thing.

I’ve taken it upon myself to
include those people born in the early 1970s in
this new group called X. If anyone eventually
tries to file me into a different group, I will
fiercely resist. I’m living right beside the “techni-
cal” Xers, and this particular zeitgeist is all I
know right now. It’s the climate with which I'll
identify my “formative” years. Together we’ll
define the decade that will take us into the next
millennium. I .

But we still .have a little under six years until
we reach what will undoubtedly be a cosmic,
political, cultural and historical milestone. I won-
der how many of television’s talking heads and
newspaper columnists (at least those who will
still be around and kicking then) are preparing
their insights—to-end—all-insights regarding this
century, and indeed, this millennium? The mind
boggles at the number of retrospective television
shows. that could possibly be in the works right
now.While I have a sense of curiosity about all
this, I can definitely wait to witness it. See, along
with the incredible anticipation of the concept of
the future that Generation X thrives upon, I
think there are a lot of us who feel a certain
doubt about the whole thing.

There are parallels between the baby-boomer
and the X generations. Both faced political, cul-
tural and societal challenges, and witnessed their
fair share of momentary disillusionment. Of
course, the big difference is that Generation X
isn’t finished yet. It’s just starting, and anxiety
and trepidation continue to thrive right along
with it. In a way, we have taken these fears and
turned them into our own resistant attitude,
which supplies us with a definite spirit, most
easily defined as cynical, although a horde of
other adjectives could be substituted, such as

Americans. When the 1990s

arrived, we found ourselves even
further oppressed by crime, violence, life-threat-
ening diseases and a high level of general intol-
erance. We desperately needed someone to take
responsibility for resolving our predicament, and
no one has. Not even Clinton, but I’m not going
to trash him, because I doubt any one person
could fix the various ills of our society.

There were several central ideas I got from
Generation X . One is that personal responsibility
is the key to everything, from finding happiness

"to solving problems. Another consists of the
belief that individuals should most certainly
attempt to fulfill their own goals, which might
occasionally involve screwing, figuratively (or,
hell, literally), the other guy or gal. Such an
attitude is not nice to think about, and it’s even
a bit ironic since the idea of responsibility exists
alongside it. However, such is the cynical, in-
your-face, rebellion-laden attitude of Generation
X, and I’m proud to take part in its propagation.

Coupland warned us that “nostalgia is a
weapon.” I’m inclined to agree with him on this
point, but I engaged in a Beatles marathon
when Feb. 9, 1994 rolled around, and I’ll always
wave my nostalgia flag on Nov. 22. See? Right
back in Coupland’s face.

Where do you think you’ll be on Dec. 31,
1999? When I arrived at this chapter in
Generation X, I had to stop reading for awhile,
as an intense feeling of nostalgia and uncertainty

‘swept over me which I then felt guilty for expe-
riencing, given Coupland’s admonition against
nostalgia. Anyway, on the eve before the next
millennium, I hope you’re with someone you
love, doing what you love, and that you cruise
contentedly into Jan. 1, 2000.

Baseball '94 means new unis, players and an extra pair of divisions

The fabric of America — beer,
hot dogs and salty peanuts.

Oh, the great American pas-
time (maybe that’s why over 50
percent of the nation is over-
weight) / "(lat have to love it.

It’s beginning to be.-- that time
again. When people swap their
sweaters for t-shirts and their
shovels for lawnmowers. As the
winters coldness recedes, and
the sight of spring emerges. it
marks a special time of year for
some.

The new year’s first smell of
leather, the first sound of the
crack of the bat and the sight of
players spewing chewing tobac-
co means one thing, baseball
spring training has begun.

A baseball fan’s utopia.

Now it is time to see how the
new players look in different
uniforms. Time to pencil in your
favorite team’s starting lineup,
pitching rotation and batting

order. Time to start thinking
who you’re going to draft in the
fantasy leagues.

But most importantly, your
favorite team has a clean slate.
All teams start from scratch and
can forget about all the disap-
pointments and problems of last
season (unless you're a Toronto
Blue jays fan). Time to think
optimistically.

Break out your team’s para-
phernalia, except those so-
called Phillies fans. Two years
ago when the Phillies were in
the National League cellar, you
could count the Phillie hats on
one hand. Since the Phils’
overnight rags-to-riches success.
everyone suddenly decided
they like those classy gentlemen
from Philadelphia. For those
diehard fans, I congratulate you
on a_ good season. But for those
bandwagoners, I have one thing
to say to you: I hope you saved

your receipt.

The birth of a new season
always brings many changes -
but this year there are some
unprecedented ones.

Like always, some teams look
for new identities, so they
change their uniforms (as if that

Sean
Duncan

is really going to help). The
Houston Astros decided that
their orange, blue and white
striped uniforms were no longer
acceptable, so they changed to
an outer-space image to fit their
name. To put it mildly their uni-
forms are  different.

The Cleveland Indians are
tracing their roots with a tint of
new, as they are going back to

their traditional cursive C of the
1950’s with the Indian logo in
the center. The Detroit Tigers
have modified their hats with a

tiger ready to attack in the mid- «

dle of their logo. .

And like always, players are
being swapped around like an
overpriced ﬂea market.

Some significant changes are:
Rafael Palmeiro, Chris Sabo and

Sid Fernandez all went to
Baltimore.
Expos second baseman

Delino Deshields was traded to
the Dodgers in their effort to
contend with the Giants in the
NL West. The Yankees took one
more step to solidify their
revamped pitching staff by sign-
ing Phillies ace Terry
Mulholland. Although the
Rangers lost their star first base-
man Palmeiro, they replaced
him with another star. Will
Clark. In an effort to get some

production out their designated
hitter slot, the White Sox signed
veteran Julio Franco.

But the most drastic change,
and I mean drastic, is the
realignment of leagues and
playoffs.

Baseball finally did it. They
tampered with tradition and
sold their souls to the monsters
of corporate America.

In order to resurrect baseballs
dying population, the owners

decided to change the tradition-

al four divisions (AL East and
West and NL East and West) to
six, adding a Central division
like football.

Whiltfllis. does is give three
division winners in each league.
and also a wild-card team who
has -the next best record, playoff
slots.

For example, the Giants, who
won 105 games last season, but

team competed in the Big East
Indoor Track and Field
Championship.

As the last race was over and
the final score was tallied, the
Panthers finished tied for sixth
place with host team Syracuse.

“Overall, I think we did well,”
head coach Steve Lewis said. “If
a couple of breaks would have
gone our way today, we could
of finished in third place. But
for the most pait, our guys did
exactly what they could do.”

Even though the Panthers
didn’t win the Big East crown,
they won the respect of the rest
of the competition in the Big
East as Tim Flander and Dietrich

Jells stood tall.

During the first day of compe-
tition, senior co-captain Flander
broke the school record in the
pentathalon. Flander’s score of
3,782 gave the Oakmont, Pa.
native a second-place finish to
Villanova’s David Cook who set
a Big East record with 3,861
points.

Flanders wasn"t through as he
came back the next day and
competed in the high jump as
he scored valuable points for
Pitt with his sixth-place jump
with a height of 6 feet, 5 inches.

Jells took home two second-
place finishes as well a school
record to go along with an
NCAA qualifying time in the
sprint events.

When the Panthers
moved to the pommel
horse, Severino and
Youndt led the way with
scores of 9.20 and 9.05,
respectively. Returning
from an ankle injury,
Jason Lannie scored 8.40,
about which he said, “I
felt I did well but I feel
that I still need to do
work.” Other scores were
7.80 by Sweeten, 7.75
from Jon Shapiro and 7.55
by Brian Nawaez.

The best apparatus for
the Panthers was rings.

this event. It was led by
Severino (9.60), Narvaez

The event that seemed
to kill the Pitt team was
the high bar. According to
sophomore Mike Maurer,
“We could have won but

that we were finally a
team again.”

to go Lyles overtook Jells.

As the smoke cleared, Lyles
set a new Big East record with a
sizzling time of 21.45 seconds.
Jells took second, broke the
school record and posted 21

scorching time of 21.52.

But to Jells the competitor,
just breaking the school record
wasn’t good enough.

“I ran a good time, and I

“As far as taking second — I

Williams’ best race came in
the 400 meters when he took a
surprising third—place finish
with his personal best time of
48.94 seconds.

In the mile, Pitt’s Frank
Nesko, who was iunning in the
back of the pack for the first 800
meters, had a real gut check
with one lap to go.

As Nesko sprinted around the
track, it was evident that Pitt’s
junior distance runner was on a
mission. With 40 meters to go,
Nesko out-sprinted
Georgetown’s Kevin Jermyn,
giving Nesko sole possession of
third place with a time of

SYRACUSE — This past
weekend at the 15th annual
Big East Indoor Track and
Field Championship at the
Carrier Dome, Najuma
Fletcher took a starring role.

Fletcher, a sophomore for
the Pitt Lady Panthers, was
awarded the Outstanding
Field Peiformer award in the
women’s competition.

“Najuma was .the most
competitive person of this
meet,” assistant coach Keisha
Demas said. “She did the
best that she could for the
team. It was beautiful
because she was not at once
thinking about herself.

The Guiana native was the
main reason that an under-
sized Pitt team finished the
two-day championship in
fourth place with 78 points,

jump and the high_ jump, as
well as a third—place finish in
the triple jump.

Fletcher, who was faced
with chances to break meet
records throughout the
weekend, sacrificed them for
the good of the team.

"She had to be conserva-
tive, and she also knew that
she had a bunch of things to
do," head coach Steve Lewis
said. “Every now and then
she would get on to some-
thing and it would take a lit-
tle bit more energy to go
after it.”

Competing in the long
jump, the engineering major
crushed the competition as
she broke her personal and
school record with a NCAA
qualifying leap of 20-feet—5
3/4-inches.

Pitt wrestling drops last four‘ matches of year

By Tyson Nagy

For The Pitt ‘News

It proved to be a tough week-
end —— check that, a tough
month —— for the Panther
wrestling team.

After posting an impressive 9-
4 record and looking to crack
the Top 25, the Panthers fin-
ished the regular season by
dropping their last four match-
es.

“Its been a struggle for us the
last couple of weeks, said assis-
tant coach Scott Hovan. “We’ve
had our big guys out with
injuries, and it really has hurt
us."

What has been encouraging
for the Panthers is that they

' have wrestled hard all year. In

fact, all eight of their losses this
season have come against Top

25 teams.

Friday night, Pitt traveled to
West Virginia to take on the
Mountaineers. It was a match
the Panthers would like to for-
get. West Virginia did little
wrong, coasting to a 52-5 deci-
sion.

“With all our injuries the sec-
ond-team guys have to step up,”
said Hovan.

On top of all the injuries, the
Panthers were without their best
wrestler, Rich Catalano, who
was sick.

The Panthers actually had to
wait until the final bout to get
on the board. Heavyweight Pat
Wiltanger got the only Pitt
points with a decision over
WVU’s Jim Howard.

Sunday night, Pitt traveled to
State College to take on the
fourth-ranked Nittany Lions.

National Leadership Honor Soc tea;

with the assistance of the Blue and Gold Society
PRESENTS:

Penn State prevailed, but the
Pitt wrestlers, like they have
done all year, wrestled tough.

“The match score wasn’t
indicative of the way we wres-
tled,” said Hovan. “I thought we
could have won six bouts
instead of four. It was a close
match.”

The match started off encour-
agingly for the Panthers, how-
ever. Chris Stevens, who has
really come on in the later half
of the season, won a 3-0 deci-
sion at 118 lbs.

But then came Penn State’s
nationally-ranked tandem of
Sanshiro Abe and Cary Kolat.
Ranked second and first in the
nation, respectively, Abe and
Kolat scored successive pins at
126 and 134 lbs.

“I’ve always been impressed
with Kolat,” said Hovan. “He

Pitt’s Rich Catalano returned
from illness to win a decision at
167 lbs.

The Panthers Derek Burgert
and Sean Kennedy won consec-
utive matches at 177 and 190
lbs.

But Penn State wasn’t done
yet, as they still had one more
talented wrestler to put on the
mat. Kerry McCoy, the nations
number-one ranked heavy-
weight, earned an 8-4 decision
over Pitt’s Pat Wiltanger to fin-
ish the regular season with a 26-

Fletcher

Continued from page 7
Fletcher did just about
the same in the ‘high
jump, as she blew away
the competition with a
jump of 5-feet-10-inches,
making for another
school record and NCAA
qualifying standard.

In the-triple jump, she
took third with a jump of
40-feet—6 3/4 inches. It
was a jump good enough
to qualifying her for the
ECAC’s.

But in the pentathlon,
Fletcher was in a league
of her own as she. scored
4,045 points, winning all
but one event.

First-year performer
Shana Fadis also fared
well in the pentathlon as
she captured third with
5,238 points.

Fadis feels that since
she didn’t participate in
the pentathlon as a high
schooler in Ohio, that
made this year’s third-
place finish even sweeter.

“I just wanted to come
up here and get eighth
place,” Fadis said. “I
didn’t think I was going to
get third. I was just
shocked, and I just did
what I had to do.”

In other events Mary
Allison Williams, a first-
year graduate student,
won the 55—meters with a
time of 7.8() second
becoming a four—time Big
East champion.

nine games. Their only losses in
that stretch were back-to-back
overtime losses to Villanova and
Connecticut. The Eagles are tied
with Syracuse for third in the
Big East, while the Panthers
have fallen to sixth.

The Eagles’ strength is their
experience. Seniors Billy
Curley, Howard Eisley, Malcolm
Huckaby and Gerrod Abram are
only the 26th quartet in NCAA
history to each score 1,000
points while on the same squad.
This BC team is reminiscent of
the 1990-91 Panthers with Jason
Matthews, Brian Shorter, Bobby
Martin and Darelle Porter. all of
whom scored over 1,000 career
points.

And while this year's Panthers
long for a forward of Shorters
ability to match up with current
BC rookie Danya Abrams.
tonight’s game does provide
some interesting matchups.

Pitt's senior center Eric
Mobley goes up against Curley
(19.9 ppg), the fourth-leading
scorer in the Big East.

Mobley is hot. He’s coming
off a career game, in which he
scored 30 points in the
Panthers’ double—overtime loss
to Villanova on Saturday.

Curley is the most consistent
scoring center in the Big East.
He will get his points. Pitt needs
Mobley to play more like he did
in the second half of the
Villanova game, where he hit
eight of 10 from the field, than
he did in the first half of that
game (four of 11). Both players
average over eight rebounds
per game.

BC is the best three—point
shooting team in the Big East,
largely due to Eisleys league-
leading .500 three—point shoot-
ing percentage. The Panthers
are third in the Big East at
defending the three. so their

ability to defend Eisley (16.0

For the first time in Paul
Evans’ eight years as Pitt coach,
the Fitzgerald Field House has
virtually become a non-factor
for the Panthers. For the first
time in Evans’ career, Pitt has
lost four straight games at
Fitzgerald. The Panthers’ poor
play of late, the uncertainty of
Evans’ job and the likelihood of

Pitt missing the NCAA tourna-
ment has made for a flat Pitt
crowd that has a penchant for
booing.

A win against BC in the last
home game of the season prob-
ably won’t do much for the
Panthers as far as an NCAA
tourney at—large bid is con-
cemed, but it could do a lot for
the Panthers and their
fans.

The Psychology behind,

the Citibank ClassicVisa card: The

emotional security of the Photocard, now with No Annual Fee.
The Citibank Classic Visa” instills in students feelings of safety, security, and general
wellness not unlike those experienced in the womb. Therefore, it is the mother of all
credit cards. ‘II Some experts attribute these feelings to the Citibank Photocard, the
-ﬁrst credit card with your photo on it. A voice inside says, “This
is me, really me.” (As opposed to, “Who the heck is that?”—a

common response to the photo on one’s Student ID.) lt’s an

within 24 hours. Or the 24-Hour Customer Service line, your
hotline if you will, for any card-related anxiety whatsoever. ‘ll Further analysis reveals
three services that protect the services you make on the Citibank Classic Visa card,
at no additional cost. 1. Buyers Security” can cover them against accidental damage,

2. Citibank Lifetime Warranty“ allows one to extend the warranty for the expected
service life of eligible products up to 12 years? 3. And Citibank Price Protection
assures you of the best price. You need only see the same item advertised in print for
less, within 60 days, and Citibank will refund the difference up to $150‘ (hence no Post
Purchase Depression). ‘J1 Special student savings are particularly therapeutic. For example,
you can receive a $20 Airfare Discount‘ on any domestic ﬂight. (Case studies indicate
that a//Fear of Flying is overcome when Spring Break in sunny Florida is a possibility.)
