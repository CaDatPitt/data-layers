Group Views
Teacher Role

Chancellor Edward H. Litch-
ﬁeld has appointed a faculty task
force to explore the role of
teaching in the University.

The committee will investigate
whether sufficient emphasis is
placed on teaching by the various
faculties and explore ways of
extending teaching effectiveness,
evaluating good teaching, and re-
warding good teachers.

The group is headed by Dr.
Stanton Crawford, secretary of
the University and dean of fac-
ulties. Its six members are all
faculty, chosen on the basis of
recommendations by the various

‘deans’ of the University.

“The so-called ‘ﬂight from
teaching’ is of considerable con-
cern,” said Dr. Crawford, “not
only at this institution, but
throughout the academic world.
Some faculties have recognized
this already and have begun to
correct the situation.

Eric Stern, junior history honors major, defeated Har-
vey Lefton for the presidency of Student Government by a
margin of 122 votes. Stern received 701 votes as compared
with Lefton’s 579.

Jerry Hogan, junior mechanical engineering major and

the only official candidate for the vice-presidency received .

931 votes for the office. Write-in votes for vice-president totaled 103,
with Franz Delahan, an eligible candidate, receiving 12 of them.

The Pitt Progressive Party carried the School of Liberal Arts
with 13 out of the 14 senatorial seats. Able Party Chairman Marty
Engles received the remaining seat. Able Party members were vic-
torious in the Schools of Education, Nursing, and Eingineering and
Mines. An independent, write-in candidate, won the seat for the
School of Pharmacy,

Approximately 1,400 students voted in this years election as
compared with 900 last year, according to John, Vrana, SG president.
Voting in the School of Engineering and Mines increased by appro-
ximately 300 per cent over last year and the School of Liberal Arts
increased by about 100 per cent.

Vrana explained that only about two ballots in every 100 were
partially" invalidated. Last year almost 15 per cent of the ballots were
disqualiﬁed.

Following the announcement of the results, Stern declared that

“I feel we have that mandate to ﬁnally allow Pitt to fulﬁll all of its
promises we are in the process of evercoming.”

The Able senatorial candidates elected in the School of Educa-
tion are: Kay Shenesky, a sophomore and chairman of SG Academic
Integrity Committee, received '48 votes; and Sue Steigman, junior

Budget Plans

Announced

By JACKIE KATZ
This is the first in a series of
articles to explain the statistical
rationale for what several student

leaders consider a need for an '

Activities Fee.

Approximately 2.2 per cent of
the University’s total operating
budget for 1964-65 is allocated
for student and general affairs.
These ﬁgures were released by
Lawrence L. Monnett, vice chan-
cellor for business affairs, at the
Student Affairs Committee meet-
ing Tuesday.

The amount of money set aside
for student and general .aifairs,_is
"$1,225,800 out of the University’s
total operating budget of $57,-
599,300. This money covers such
things as office rent and advi-
sories’ salaries, not only student
activities as many may assume.

Total University income from

primary sources is $56,627,400. _»

The breakdown of both the total
income and the total operating
budget is as follows:

“The cost of instruction does
not include expenses for the li-
brary, student aid, or the health
fee," Monnett said. “There is a
deﬁnite correlation, though, be-

" tween the tuition and fees re-

ceived and the cost of instruc-
tion. One will increase as the
other does. The cost of instruc-
tion causes tuition to rise.”

The money received for spon-
sored research is greater than
the money allocated for this item
because, in giving a research
grant, the government also gives
money for overhead costs such
as maintenance and library ex-
penses. The additional money re-
ceived for sponsored research is
used for this purpose.

Money for the Western Psy-
chiatric Institute and Clinic
(WPIC) is not controllable by the
University, The University re-

. ceives this money in order to

maintain the institute.

During the meeting, Monnett
also answered questions present-
ed to him by the steering com-
mittee for the Activities Fee. The
committee is composed of John
Vrana, Michael Marcuse, Norman
Himcs, Harvey Lefton, Josey
Grossman, Dr. Alan C. Rankin,
vice chancellor of student and
general affairs, and Helen Pool
Rush, dean of students. The
questions were:

> How much have endowment,

, state aid, tuition, and gifts in.

creased over the past years?

“The amount of state appro-
priation hasn’t_ increased,” Mon-
nett said, and also the unrestrict-
ed gifts, grants, and endowment
income has not come up to ex-
pectation.” Monnett explained
that many of the grants, gifts,
and endowment received are for
speciﬁc purposes and can not be
used for anything other than
what is speciﬁed.

ty’s endowment is for speciﬁc or

>What does the University
spend on faculty salaries? What
is the total cost of instruction
provided by the University?

The faculty salary expenditures
in 1963-64 were $10,536,000. as
compared with $17,027,435 for
the total cost of instruction in the
same period.

>What is the purpose of the
University Fee?

The following is the statement
of the Board of Trustees regard-
ing the University Fee:

“The Board of Trustees directs
that all receipts from this Univer-
sity Fee shall be segregated and
deposited in a reserve account. It
is speciﬁcally directed that the
receipts from this source shall be
subject only to special appropria-
tion by the Trustees for the pur-

_ chase of land, the construction

of buildings, ~ the purchase of
equipment, the payment of capi-
tal debts, and/or for such other
purposes which the Trustees
shall authorize.”

The University Fee is 20 per_

cent of the tuition with a maxi-
mum of $120.

> How rigid is the budget?

“The budget must be commit-
ted approximately ten months
before the income is known,”
Monnett explained. “The budget
goes to the Board of Trustees in
May, but we don’t realize our
income until the fall. The per-
formance of the budget has fallen
on the income side. There is a
lot of inﬂexibility in the budget.”

Monnett also explained that the
student activities budget would
grow as the University and the

  University

student body grew. “I wouldn't
predict an increase for next year,
though,” he said. “The Universi-
rate growth of expense is great-
er than the rate growth of in-
come.”

The $35 graduation fee which
seniors pay is used to help meet
the expense of graduation, ac-
cording to Dr. Rankin. “Com-
mencement costs $36,000 for one
morning,” Dr. Rankin said.

Concerning the Activities Fee
speciﬁcally, Monnett said that
“whatever money is received for
the Activities Fee will be taken
out and put into a separate led-
ger account earmarked for stu-
dent activities only. It will be
transferred to the Student Af-
fairs Committee in one lump sum
for distribution to the activities.”

When questioned as to how the
ﬁgure of $5 per term for the Ac-
tivities Fee was arrived at, Vrana
explained that when the Stu-

dent Affairs Committee started-

reviewing the budgets of the stu-
dent organizations early in the
year, many groups had requested
more than they received.

“Some groups’ were hindered
from having "new programs,”
Vrana said, “The $5 fee was the
closest to what We felt was gen-
erally needed. There will possibly
be .a reserve fund for allocation
during the year for special proj-
ects.” ‘

Monnett said that any unspent
balance in the Activities Fee ac-
count would be carried forward
for the next year in contrast to
other University departments
which have their own budgets
and use excess income to help
defray overall expenses.

During a previous Student Af-
fairs Committee meeting, a. dis-
cussion among the members in-
dicated that students who are in-
volved in student activities are
the ones who favor the fee. and
engineers are not in favor of it
because they do not participate.

It was also pointed out that
the student body is divided into
three groups: those who support

the idea of a fee, those who can
be educated to support it, and
those who will oppose it and
whose minds cannot be changed.
Women's Housing Board is 98
per cent in favor of the.fee.

 

   

Legal Basis for HUAC

By J. D. GLASSER.

There is no legal basis for the
existence of the House Un-Amer-
ican Affairs Committee (HUAC),
said University Law School Dean
Thomas Cooley in a lecture
Wednesday night in the Student
Union Supper Room. 0

The lecture was the ﬁrst in a
series sponsored by the Pitt Stu-
dents for Peace; it concerned the
abolition" of the Committee.
Among the other arguments cited
by Dean Cooley for stricter con-
trol of the Committee's activities
by Congress were the embarrass-
ment and inconvenience it causes
innocent people, its use as a
weapon for prejudice, and mis-
use of its legal powers.

But his main point was that
HUAC should be abolished be-
cause it has no reason for exis-
tence as a House committee. The
purpose of a Congressional com-
mittee is to ﬁnd out information
about legislation in a. speciﬁc
area of concern. Since HUAC is
operating in an area where there

is no constitutional basis for leg-
islation and has never sponsor-
ed any legislation on national se-
curity it has no business being
a committee, Dean Cooley de-
clared.

Dean Cooley is a member of
the Committee of 100, a group
of constitutional authorities who
oppose the existence of HUAC.
By their opposition, they have
gained the support of congress-
man who previously were afraid
to take a public stand against it.

The Committee of -100 hopes to
succeed in getting HUAC abolish-
ed during the next session of
Congress. They have also rec-
ommended that HUAC proceed-
ings be buried in the Archives
after its abolition, so that the in-
formation dredged up cannot be
used against innocent people.

SG Ballots Tallied in Top Secrecy

 Able Party Retracts Libel

l\.,

A meeting of the Appeals
Committee on Student Gov-
ernment Elections was called
late Wednesday evening to
resolve campaign conflicts
between the presidential candi-
dates in the Student Government
Election.

The speciﬁc point of conﬂict
arose from certain allegations
made by the Able Party in a
mimeographed sheet, printed and
distributed late Tuesday night.

The paragraph found in “Ob-
servations from the Able View-
point” —- Part Two read: “The
Pitt Progressive Party (PPP) to-
night endorsed Eric Stern for
Student Government President.
Perhaps his participation in the
FAIR PLAY FOR CUBA COM-
MITTEE has inﬂuenced the PPP’s
decision. WE HOPE IT WILL IN-
FLUENCE YOURS.”

Stern, an independent presi-
dential candidate in the SG elec-
tion received the PPP’s endorse-.
ment Tuesday night, the night
before the election. While Stern
did receive the endorsement, the
PPP statement did not constitute
an official affiliation between the
party and candidate.

At the Appeals Committee meet-
ing, candidate Stern issued the
following statements: “I formal-
ly deny membership in, partici-
pation in, or connection with, the
Fair Play for Cuba Committee.”

Marty Engels, chairman of the
Able Party, issued the following
retraction concerning the alleged
association of Stern with the Fair
Play Committee.

The statement read: “The Able
Party retracts its statement con-
cerning the relationship of Eric
stem to the Fair Play Commit-
tee. The Able Party acknow.
ledges the fact that we have no
documentation to support the
statement that Mr. Stern was as-
sociated with the Committee.”

The Appeals Committee com-
prised of student members, Faith
Leitzel and Ron Cimino and fac-
ulty repersentative, Professor of
Social Work Erma Meyerson re.
quested that both presidential
candidates and one of their re-
8PectiVe campaign associates ap-
pear before them to resolve the
conﬂicts.

Engels accompanied Able preg-
idenﬁ-al candidate Lefton. Mark
-7- Re-hmar accompanied indepen.
dent candidate Stern. The four
Sisned the following statement;

“We regret some of the occur-
rences of the past few days. We
publicly acknowledge that the
tactic of using rumors must not
be tolerated, In the future, it is
our hope that such rumors and
actions that occurred in this cam-
paign be avoided, by improving
communication between candi-
dates and parties.”

Prior to the Appeals Commit-
tee meeting, it had been rumor-
ed that stem would institute lib-
el proceedings based on the state-
ments found in the Able Party
campaign literature. Following
the meeting, however, Stern him-
self state, “Because I am fully
satisﬁed with the retraction of
the false material I do not plan
to institute a civil suit.”

Votes for the Student Gov-
ernment election were tal-
lied late Wednesday evening
under conditions of top se-
crecy. From the time ballots
were taken to the polls. by

graduate law students to the‘

ﬁnal recount of those con-
tests’ closer than ﬁfty votes,

only those certiﬁed by the
Election Committee were eligible
to participate in the proceedings.

No outside observers were per-
mitted to view the tallying in-
cluding members of the press.

Assistant Dean of Men Parker

The main concern of most can-

tailed oral description of the vot-
ing and tallying procedure to The
Pitt News.

After the ballots and locked
ballot boxes were taken to the
polls at 9:30 a.m. the students
had their invoices stamped, sign-
ed an official voting list, marked
their ballots in enclosed booths,
and deposited them in the ballot
boxes.

It was discovered that the orig-
inal ballots lacked the names of
three "liberal arts candidates.
Only the relatively few ballots
cast before 11 a.m. were voided.
New ballots were at the polls by
12 noon and those students whose
votes had been invalidated were
allowed to revote.

When the polls closed at 7 p.m.
the ballot boxes were taken to
the Dean of Men's office by SG
advisor Barbara Ginsberg and
four graduate law students.

The boxes were opened in one
of two counting areas on the

Iiiditorial: Long

The plug was pulled from the dam this week, and all the discontent
with the students’ depersonalized position, all the disgust with student
leaders drinking tea with the adminstration, all the frustration of impo-
tence gushed forth in an unparalleled display of spirit and the election of

‘ Eric stérii.

Harvey Lefton had not guts, they screamed, so they looked to Eric

Stern and found what they wanted—an image, a charisma, a symbol of

independence and student autonomy. And the Pitt Progressive Party

backed him, not necessarily because they agreed with all his planks, but

because he stood for what they believed in. The spontaneity of the endorse-

ment was exciting and frightening. Students who sat in the cafeteria
Tuesday night feeling that Lefton was a shoo-in walked up the steps to

.a soap-box, a dynamic soap box and cheers and stamping and rivalry and
hatred. The PPP had a candidate and the Able Party had a candidate;

1 ‘ it was war.

It was war with all the ‘dirt that can come with a two-party system.

_ We asked for competition and we got it: in the irrationality of campaign-

     

 

 aymy lllave

ing there was slander andpotential libel—inexcusable but not unexpected.
Some students had found “meaning” in their undergraduate existence
when the opposition least expected it, and they lashed out in opposition
with a despicable McCarthy-like tactic.

It is hard to say if the Able Party realized the strength of the
accusation they threw at Eric Stern; with the beneﬁt of the doubt, let us
assume they used it out of desparation, which by no means defends it, to
counteract one of the most fantastic reactions in University history. The
students were prime: some one gave them a flag and they waved it.

Call it a twentieth century reaction to a depersonalized organization,
call it a basic human need to be recognized as important, What happened
here this week is one of the most signiﬁcant things to happen to this school.

Stern’s election and the PPP landslide mark an official acceptance
of a new philosophy, of an established outlet for a new student body, but,

most fortunately", Jerry Hogan and several Able winners will continue to
balance the two-party Senate. That soap box should be far from silent now.

A TWO Day Blitz: The Immediate and the Future  

Campaign and Election Analysis

 BY Larry Bernfeld

Tuesday Noon: Prognosis

They could hear their voices echo off the
mirrors in the Student Union Ballroom. Twenty-
four Student Government, candidates presented
themselves and their platforms to the “atten-
tive” student body, all 50 of them, on Tuesday
at noon.

For all that was accomplished, they -could
have slept till noon. All the ﬁre and brimstone
of ‘a political speech seems unreal and forced in

. . 11 environment Where it falls
only upon the ears of opposi-
-.: tion candidates and empty
chairs. .

Political speeches can
_ serve at least two functions.
 When based on slogans and
ﬂag waving they can attract
the large segment of voters
looking for a personality and
a catch-phrase to use as a hat-
rack upon which to hang their
“voter responsibility.”

~ WHEN BASED on ideas,

BERNFELD issues, and platforms, politic-
al speeches can mobilize the support of the
political “activist” interested in the substance
as well as the procedure of politics. The few
who attended this Midday campaign “High-
light” were greeted by both types of speeches.
‘The majority of those who voted on Wednes-
day were personally greeted by neither.

What went wrong?

At least three things. Two _were short-run
planning flaws relating to Election Forum.pub-
licity and candidate carelessness, respectively.
The third, a long-range environmental Pittfall.

\ ;« \ -.-.v.3,;e:

  
  
  
  
 
 
 
 
 

The rationale behind holding the Forum
the day before elections was to leave a fresh
imprint upon the minds of the voters. Yet, is
one day sufficient for the student body to re-
ﬂect upon a candidate’s stated views? Is one
day sufficient in personally conveying the mes.-
sage of an individual or a party to the elec-

torate ‘I

I FEEL there is the need for more than
one such Election Forum. Yet, why have more
than one Forum if students cannot spare even
one lunch hour to attend? The skimpy turnout
can be attributed partially to a lack of pub-
licity. The question that next arises is where

the responsibility for such publicity lies.

Notice of the Forum appeared once in The

Pitt News.» Signs about the Forum appeared

near the SU doors the day ‘of the speeches.
This certainly isn’t spectacular publicity, but
it does ﬁll the non-partisan election commit

tee’s initial responsibility.
Who was lacking then? The answer is,

the candidates themselves._ In any municipal,
state, or federal election it is the responsibility

" ‘of the party or the individual candidates to do

their own campaigning and prepare their own
publicity. .
The parties and candidates could have in-

_ ‘ cluded notice that they were speaking at the
 ~F9rum in their politicaleds in.The Pitt News»    

 

  

They could have collared their supporters indi-
vidually or they could have enlisted the aid of
little old ladies in dirty white tennis sneakers to
pull ten potential voters each out of the Tuck
Shop, Hunt Room and SU Lower Lounge. They
have a right to complain that too few showed
up. They have no right to expect to be spoon-
fed in the big bad world of politics, whether

I under university ivy or on a soap box in a

town square.

YET THERE IS a strong case to be stated
for a long-run environmental factor. There is
no guarantee that immense amounts of pub-
licity, intense personal efforts by candidates or
more Forums would result in increased atten-
dance at such meetings.

Student perception of the Student Govern-
ment organization is something that is built
up over a long period of time. Many students
just don’t associate SG with the possibility of

changing or affecting major administrative pol- V

icy. While the connection is not necessarily
casual, the actions and attitudes of the party
in power can be very relevant to problems of
voter interest and participation.

Tuesday Eve: Development

_ The ﬁrst part of this column was written
Tuesday afternoon in the hours almost immedi-
ately following the noon Election Forum. In
the political atmosphere of the University,
change ordinarily comes slowly.

I therefore was surprised, in fact excited,
to ﬁnd on that very evening, a demonstration
of the type of political activism which I have
been advocating. The Pitt Progressive Party
(PPP) held a political rally in the Towers
Lobby during prime spectator time — the late
dinner hour. Influential graduating seniors
along with leaders and representatives of the
PPP spoke, and actually communicated with

their audience.

The surprise move of the evening was the
spectacular endorsement of independent presi-
dential candidate Eric Stern by the PPP and
the even more spectacular meeting-of-the-minds
which resulted between Stern and his audience
of hundreds in the dynamic speech that follow-
ed. The endorsement of candidate by party, an
apparently sincere desire to institute a strong
platform, coupled with their willingness to
make the personal appeal to their electorate
marks a highly important form of student in-

volvement.

WHILE SOME may interpret this last min-
ute effort as an astute political move designed
to prevent the incumbent Able party from plag-
arizing the PPP type of appeal as they alleged-
ly did to the PPP platform, it is more likely
the result of crucial planning that came too
late.

The two most important educative func-
tions of the campaign took place on Tuesday,
the last day. Hopefully, for the sake of a po-
tentially strong two-party system at the Uni-
versity, the PPP Tuesday night rally, will have
made itself felt in the election tally.

 The“ problems of campaign procedure and

lack of effective student involvement could
easily be with us a long time after the 1965

SG election becomes old news. Party competi-
tion and the pursuit of meaningful issues over
the next year can have a strong positive effect
on student attitudes and involvement in a Uni-
versity community where the potential for po-
litical sophistication is high. Just as important
is a realization. of where the burdens and de-
tails of leadership fall in a student-oriented, or
in any other, political system.

 Without Joy

   

 

   

By ROBERT SUPANSIC

On June 24, 1954, Mobile Group
100 of the French forces ﬁghting
in Indochina was surrounded and
destroyed in ambush on a road
not far from the village of Pleiku.

The end of the task force 100
was something out of the ordin-
ary even in that war in 1954
where the unusual was to be ex-
pected. G.M. 100 had tanks and
105 mm Howitzers; among the
units in its ranks was the famed
“Korea Battalion” of the French
Army.

The ambush ‘ran true to form,
even if somewhat spectacular in
scope. The road was blocked in
front, both sides of the road were
mined and vehicles could not
turn around, Even though the
enemy ﬁred mortars and recoil-
less riﬂes from practically point-
blank range, they remained un-
seen.

Before it met the Viet-Minh in
Indochina in 1954, the Groupe
Mobile 100 would have been an
asset to any modern Western
army. How an army of relative
amateurs could take apart some
of the (finest troops the West
could throw at them is the sub-
ject of Bernard B. Fall’s classic,
Street Without Joy (Stackpole,
Harrisburg, Pa., $7.95, 408 pp.).

Fall has recently reissued the
book, which was ﬁrst published
in 1954, in a new edition up-
dated to include events in Laos
and Vietnam to November of
1964.

Ten years ago, Fall watched
the French defeat themselves in
Indochina. Their obsession with
.pincer movements and fortiﬁed
lines, tactics developed to perfec-

tion during World War II in
Europe, sapped their strength as
the Viet- lVIinh slowly nibbled
away at their lines.

In the end, when the set-piece
battle the French had yearned
for was fought, the French gaI‘1‘i'
son at Dien Bien Phu found the
tactics of World War H in Eur-
ope not applicable to guerrila
war in Southeast Asia.

Throughout the book, one waits
for the French to get off the
roads and out into the jungle.
but it never happens—at least
not soon enough — on a large
enough scale. . ‘

Fall indicates, however, what
the efficacy of such guerilla op-
erations might be: during the bat-
tle for Dien Bien Phu, 5,000 “anti-
guerrillas” operating behind Viet-
Minh lines tied down approxi-
mately 14 battalions of infantry;
the garrison off the fort, three
times as many men consuming
30 times the supply tonnage, held
down only twice as many batta-
lions of Viet-Minh infantry.

But the key to the Guerrilla
war, or “revolutionary warfare,”
as Fall calls it, is the political
underpinning that swings the
‘people to one side or another.
The French, at least at the be-
ginning, saw the war as one of
“colonial re-conquest.”

The Viet-Ninh lost no time in
sending that through their pro-
paganda mill and thus rallying
local support. Thus, the Viet-
Minh almost always had perfect
intelligence as to the disposition
of the enemy. They could fade
away into the countryside at will
and had inexhaustible source of
Porters to carry supplies. ,

SG Employs Top Security
Measures in Ballot Tally

ﬁfth ﬂoor of the Student Union
in the presence of all 12 counters,
the four members of the election
committee, one dean and two
members. The counting areas
were always supervised by at
least one SG advisor.

The ballots were ﬁrst checked
by two people for erasures, stray
marks, and the proper number
of candidates. For example Lib-
eral Arts ballots marked for all
15 PPP senatorial candidates
were invalidated because students
could only vote for 14 senators.

Discrepancies in ballots were
rechecked by an SG advisor, the
only person permitted to inval-
idate improperly marked ballots.
All such ballots had to be offl-
cially signed by one of the ad-
visors.

The ballots were given to a
reader in one of the counting
areas, who, in the case of those
reading Liberal Arts ballots, had
six counters tallying for  All

counting took place with an ad-
visor watching and all contests
separated by less than 50 votes
underwent a recount by a new
set of tallyers.

dents “look at the facts, three

plete list of candidates.

PPP candidate Michael Ruxin,
commenting on past Able Party
leadership, told the audience,
“Look at the attendance here. Its
a reﬂection of the interest gen-
erated during the past three
years.”

Al Kaufman, PPP, alleged that
the Able Party had plagiarized
the PPP platform, coming out
with the exact same points as
the PP just one week later. Rich-

ard Thuss, Able, insisted that‘

members of the PPP had come
to the Able Party first to discover
what was in the Able Platform,

Chancellor Appoints Faculty Force
To Investigate ‘Flight from Teaching’

“Our own physics department,
for example, condifcted a self-

members and .assign more senior
faculty to the teaching of under-

we are doing enough to encour-
age teaching throughout the Uni-
versity. And, further, we also
want to ﬁnd out what we can do
to enhance the effectiveness’ of
individual teachers. These will
be the goals of the study group.”

The committee will divide into
three special subgroups for the
study. Each of the smaller groups
will be augmented by additional
faculty members who will be in-
vited to take part in special
studies.

Panthers Seek Win

Over Strong Lions

I By FRANK SMIZIK
Coach Bob Timmons has hopes: of making the 1964-65

basketball season somewhat of a success. The Penn State

game tomorrow is one that Timmons feels could be the big-

gest win this year.

“We lost to them at State and
they have good height and play
great defense, but we’ve been
playing well the last couple of
games. They might be taking
things a little easier now that
they have a bid to the NCAA
Tournament,” said Timmons.

Penn State has a record of
17-3 and was picked as_ the team

. to represent the independent

teams in the East. The Panthers
lost to the Nittany Lions in _a
slow-down ball game, 59-40.

The Panthers got some of the’

momentum they might need for
the Lions when they trounced
Westminister, .101-71, Wednesday
night before a crowd of 676. The
same marked the first time this
year that the Panthers went over
the 100 point mark and ended a
foursame losing streak. The last
team the Panthers beat was West-

mlnister at New Wilmington,
75-61.

Westministerheldthelead

with a little over 12 minutes to
go in the ﬁrst half until Daryle
Ruby hit for two points and tied
the score at 12-12. Jim LaValley
then got the next two points and
the Panthers never relinquished
the lead.

“We beat them off the boards,
said Timmons, “We boxed them
out well and Jim LaValley did
an excellent job for us. They
weren’t too tall and Oravetz was
the only big man they had to
give us trouble.

head trainer for the Philadelphia
Eagles professional football team
and Phillies baseball team before
coming here in 1963. His chil-
dren and grandchildren live in
Philadelphia.

“I was invited by Dr. Frank
H. Krusen to join him in estab-

Westminster I V
Tops Cubs -Again

Westminster defeated the fresh-
man basketball team for the sec-
ond time this season, 86 - 69,
Wednesday night at the Field
House.

Bob Thompson paced the Cubs
with 15 points. Bill Bennett had
14, Ken Bollens contributed 13,
and Frank Famularo scored 11
points. The halftime score was
50-34 in favor of Westminster,
the fresh pulled to within eight
at the beginning of the second
half but Westminster had too
much and drew away. The loss
brought the Cub season mark to
3-12.

cent budgetary freeze as a cause
for his resignation. “There has
been no curtailing in my depart-
ment and I expect the same fa-
cilities will be here next year.
The only thing we do is watch
our use of supplies." His new
position offers him the “same
rank ‘and a little higher salary.”

Wiechek currently holds a dual-
appointment here as head of the
school's corrective program for
disabled students and as head
trainer for intercollegiate athle-
tic teams. His duties include a
rehabilitation program for dis-
abled students, an adaptive phy-
Sical education program for un-
dergraduates, the physical con-
dition of athletes, and teaching.

“He has received a very ﬁne
oﬁer,”

said Athletic Director

Frank Carver, “and we’ll deﬁnite-
ly have to make some type of
realignment in the department.”
Although Wiechek leaves some
time this spring (probaby June),
Carver has not made any new
appointments yet.

"I have not had enough time
to think it through yet,”A said
Carver, “but I think we’ll go with
what we have. We have some
ﬁrst rate‘ people in our training
department, and if we add any-
one it will probably be on a. jun-
ior level.”

“Fortunately,” contin’ued Car-
ver, “we brought in a good young
man this year.” Carver was re-
ferring to Don Graham, one of
Wiechek’s two top assistants.
Graham is a graduate of Slip-

pery Rock State Teachers Col-

lege and was a partner in a phy-
sical rehabilitation clinic in Erie,
Pa., before coming here_

 Sw1mm° ers Conclude 
Dismal Season, Meet

 

 

- Spartans, Wisconsin

By GEORGE LIES
The swimming team concludes its regular season with
a triangular meet tomorrow at Michigan State against the

Spartans and Wisconsin.

With strength and depth in every department, both
teams come highly rated. “I wanted to show_the boys $01119
real good sw_imming and the Big Ten has It,_ sald Coach
Ben Grady, “that’s why we’re going. Since this Is my ﬁrst

tri-meet, I don’t know how we’ll
do but all the boys will be try-
ing their best.”

Host team Michigan State pre-
sents one of their strongest and
best balanced contingents in
years. The Spartan 400-yard free-
style relay team composed Of
two- time All American Dick
Gretzinger, Jim Macmillan, Dar-
ryle Kifer, and Bob Sherwood
hold the National Collegiate and
American record time of 3:08.1.

Gretzinger holds the MSU rec-
ord in the 200-yard individual
medley besides swimming the
butterﬂy and freestyle events.
Macmillan, another Spartan rec-
ord-holder in the freestyle races.
swims the 100-yarder in :48.0
while going 5:07.3 in the 500.
Kifer handles the 50-yard free-
style event in :21.8.

Led by Big Ten breaststroke
champion Bob Blanchard, the
Badgers appear as formidable as
MSU. Along with Blanchard, Wis-
consin relys on Gil Lacroix in‘
the individual medley and the
long distance freestyle events
and Jack Tetart in the back-
stroke.

Co-captains John Cloninger and
Mike Marsh headline a group of
eight top freestylers.

Quarterback
Quits Football

Tries Hoops

Pete Smith( all-state quarter-
back in 1963, has quit the foot-
ball team in favor of basketball.
Smith was one of seven quarter-
backs scheduled for varsity try-
outs. Ken Lucas, Ed James, Tip-
py Pohl, Bob Bazylak, Pete El-
liott, and Jim Alcorn remain as
candidates for the starting posi-
tion. ' .

Basketball coach Bob Timmons
feels Smith will be an asset to
his depleted squad, Smith was a
guard on Uniontown high school's
team which was runner-up in
the 1963 Western Region Play-
offs. “I guess he wasn’t quite
satisﬁed with his progress in
football,” said Timmons.

Smith withdrew from school
this trimester and was consider-
ing a transfer of schools. Ath-
letic Director Frank Carver, how-
ever, convinced him of return-
ing for basketball.

Gymnastics Team Seeks 5th
Win at Temple Tomorrow

In past years the going has been rough for the gym-
nastics team,- but all that could change with the upcoming

two meets this Weekend.

Bearing a 4-4 record, the gymnasts travel to Temple
Saturday and then hurry «back for the Georgia Tech meet
Monday, 2 p.m. at the ﬁeld house in the last dual meet of

the year.

For seniors Tom lvlisage and
Roland James this could be the
first winning season since they
joined the team. Last year the
gym team won only two meets.

“I’d rate Temple at about our
level, maybe a slight shade high-
er," said coach Warren Neiger.
‘‘They’ll be tough, but if we get
everyone hitting like we have in
the last several meets I think we
can win. That’s the way we’ll
be going into the meet.”

The Owls were hurt at the be-
ginning of the season by the loss
of Mark Cohn, their top per-
former. But several other gym-
nasts are forcing Neiger to con-
c_eed ﬁrst place on the trampo-
line and ﬂoor exercise,

To counteract these threats,
Jim Sacco is expected to win the
all-around and Misage is primed
*0 Win the high bar for the sec-
ond week in a row.

MatmenWrestle Penn State;  

Rex Peery Seeks 5-5 Record

By BILL CABIN

Rex Peery attempts to
maintain his consistent
coaching record tomorrow,
when the wrestling team
travels to Penn State. Peery
has had only one team ﬁnish
below .500 in his 15 years of
coaching here, but the Wrestlers
now have a 4-5 record.
Peery anticipated a rough year.
“'Ihis could be my worst season
in 14 years,” said Peery early
this year. He cited lack of depth,
especially in the 191 and heavy-
weight divisions, as his main
problem,

His observations have unfor-
tunately been correct, with the
Wrestlers losing 10 of 11 matches
in those divisions. The Nittany
Lions, however, have similar
problems.

Don Mclienna. and John Lotz.
the Lions’ two top heavyweights,
have only wrsetled a total of
four meets this season. McKenna
is currently injured and Lotz is
academically ineligible. Tom
Stuart and Ellery Seitz have
taken their positions, compiling
a. 1-5-1 record.

NY, Balt Goals
For Track Team

Track coach Carl Rees is still

not certain who will make the
trip to New York on March 6
for the IC4A competition. “We’ll
take a carload of kids,” said Rees,
“that's for sure, But who they
will be is kinda up‘ in the air
yet.»

“Fred Poellnitz looks like the
fourth man to run with Dick
Crout, Luddy Hayden, and Bill

MARTY STRAYEII.
Penn State’s Co-captain

“Stuart is inexperienced,” said
State coach Bill Koll, after last
Weeks draw with Navy, Although
Seitz is a letterman and possess
good moves he “hasn’t learned
to loosen up in matches," said
Koll.

Stuart and Seitz are probable
starters tomorrow, and are the
weakest wrestlers Bill Bodle

(heavyweight) and Al Traunstein-
er (191) have wrestled this year.
The Lions are also week in
the 137 and 177-pound divisions.
Glenn Thiel (137) has an 0-3
record. and Mat Dunne is 1-1
since switching to 177. "Marty
Strayer had been wrestling at
1'17, but has moved to 167 in
preparation for the Easterns.

Despite their relative weak-

ness in thesedivisions, the Lions 
pose a strong attack in the 130 -

and 167-pound divisions. Strayer
and Steve Erber lead the Lion's
attack.

Enchantment Pours

By MARVW ZELKOWITZ
MY FAIR LADY is now play-
ing at the Squirrel Hill Theater.
The phone number of the theater

is HA 1-4909. Call them for tic-
kets, or go down personally and
make reservations to see it. Either
way, be sure and see it before you
go home in April. The entire movie was
a marvelous cinematic experience.

In his writing of the screen play,
Alan Jay Lerner seemed keenly aware
of the satire that George Bernard Shaw
so carefully wrote into his original play
PYGMALION.

The play’s purpose becomes clear in
the ﬁrst scene where Henry Higgins,
played by Rex Harrison, claims that the
only real difference between the British
upper crust and the lower class is their
manner of speech, If he can only teach
the cockney ﬂower girl, played by Au-
drey Hepburn, to speak correctly, he
can pass her of! as nobility.

Colonel Pickering, played by Wilfred
Hyde-White, wagers with Higgins that
he can pass her oi! as a. noblewoman at
an affair six months hence. That Pro-
fessor Higgins did it, completes the
satire.

Although carrying through the satire

was not the primary purpose of the cast,
they each shone in their roles as they
carried the plot across to the audience.

In spite of the overall superior per-
formance of the cast, Rex Harrison still
made the other seems dull'by contrast.
He stole the show. He enraptured his
audience with the melodic singing-talk-
ing style of his singing.

Unlike so many musigals, where an
abrupt change from prose to singing
exists, Harrison makes the songs follow
naturally from his spoken lines,

When he sang WHY CAN”I‘ THE
ENGLISH, he was Henry Higgins pro-
testing the English manner of speech.
And the audience listened. He held a
coffee cup while he sang, and every
movement with the cup, and every bit
choreography was natural, yet perfectly
planned to complement the song.

Harrison performed I’M AN ORDIN-
ARY MAN and I'VE GROWN ACCUS-
TOMED T0 HER FACE with the same
kind of perfection. Harrison has a cer-
tain vitality in his talk-singing that in-
evitably communicates itself to his au-
dience.

Audrey Hepburn, although not as ef-
fervescent as Rex Harrison, still played
her part well. We did not have the hand- .
icap of having seen‘Julie Andrews play

 

 
 

from ‘My F airLady’

the part of Eliza Doolittle, so Audrey
Hepburn had no handicap when we saw
her.

No matter how Audrey Hepburn is
dressed, or how dirty her face is, she is
much too elegant to play a cockney ﬂow-
er girl. She was simply Miss Hepburn
with a dirty face. She never seemed a
“prisoner of the gutters."

But Miss Hepburn’s elegance only
made her that much more convincing in
the second half of the movie, when she
had a chance to show her elegance as a
noble woman. She spoke and "acted with
a grace and ease that seemed perfectly
natural and becoming. At the ball, she ﬁt
perfectly. Audrey Hepburn was then
playing that part of her role as Eliza
Doolittle that suited her best.

Stanley Holloway, as Alfred Doolit-
tle, personiﬁed even more of the social
satire of the play. In a conversation with

‘Professor Higgins, Doolittle refers to

himself as an undeserving man, and he
wants to be that way. He can do as he
pleases when he pleases. He is unbound
by middle-class morality, and he likes
it that way.

Even his song, WITH A LITTLE BIT
OF LUCK portrayed his attitude toward
life, Alfred Doolittle doesn’t want suc-
cess. He is happy being poor, and he

doesn’t want to be any other way.

But George Bernard Shaw couldn’t
let Mr. Doolittle go on being happy. with
his station in life, so he gives Doolittle
that “Little Bit of Luck.” And Doolittle
inherits a legacy that forces him into
middle class morality. Near the close of
the movie, he even has to marry his
mistress.

The choreography in the scene at
Ascot Park further carries out the so-
cial satire theme of the movie. Lerner
and Frederick Loewe portray the upper
class here as being so conservative, that
they don’t even cheer at a horse race.
During the actual running of the race,
the spectators merely stood still and
watched_ Afterwards they said mono-
tonously, “That was the most exciting
race I have ever seen. It was simply
thrilling.”

So Professor Henry Higgins, in pas-
sing Eliya off as a noblewomen, pulled
off his hoax, and he proved, very suc-
cessfully, that class lines are something
purely superficial.

The movie is as successful with the
audience as Henry Higgins is with his
hoax. MY FAIR LADY is the ﬁnest mo-
vie to hit Pittsburgh in a while. It is
delightful, entertaining, and it has some-
thing to say, Don’t miss it.
