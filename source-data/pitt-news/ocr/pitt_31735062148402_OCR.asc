Ex-Governor Judd

Will Discuss Hawaii  

Address to State
Islands’ POSITIOII“
As Pacific Pivot
An “unofficial ambassador of
good-will” and former governor
of Hawaii, Lawrence " Mr Judd,
will discuss the relative position
of the Hawaiian Islands in the
international situation in his ad-
dress, “Hawaii———Pivot of the Pa-
ciﬁc,” this afternoon at 3 o’clock in
Foster Memorial auditorium.

Classes will not be dismissed for
the lecture, the office of the regis-
trar has announced.

Stating that thepurpose ofhis
visit is “to remove some of the
current misconceptions in regard to
the Islands, to win a wider recogni-
tion of the common interests be-
tween continental United States and
I~Iawai.i., and to demonstrate that
the Territory has more than a va-
cationing aspect,” Judd is making
the University one of his stops -" in
his current tour of the "United
States. ' “ iv.

Because of his family background",
Ex—governor Judd comes naturally
by,his Hawaiian enthusiasm. Both
his father and - grandfather played
an important role in the American-
ization of the Islands, his father
serving as -chief
Hawaiian Supreme Court, for 26
years, and his grandfather acting in
the capacity of personal political
adviser of King Kamehameha. ‘III

under the native monarchy. - H H,

Before being appointed governor
of the Islands in 1929 b-y”Presi'dent
Herbert Hoover, Judd entered the
Senate of the Territory early and
served as its president for a num-
ber of years. After nearly. ﬁve

years of service as ‘governor, he re-“V

tired from office upos the appoint-
ment of- his successor, Joseph B.
Poindexter.

Judd will also address faculty
members of the Social Science sem-
inar in the dining room of the Fac-
ulty Club at 12:30 o’clock today.

Dame Rumor
Puts N icksick
On, Off Staff

After an afternoon of lively con-
ferences andlivelier rumors, it was
deﬁnitely established last Friday
that Mike Nicksick, one—time Uni-
versity star halfback, either is or

is not still a member of Charley
Bowser’s coaching staff. 1

Persistent reports have been ﬂut-
tering about campus that Nicksick
has been offered a job on the coach-
ing staff of a large school nearby.
While noione was talking forpub-
lication, the job was supposed to
have given Nicksick a chance to get
a bigger salary at West Virginia
under Bill Kern.

Complicating matters is the fact
that West Virginia oﬁicials were
still denying Friday that they had
hired Kern.

Frank Carver, athletics publicity
man, stated Friday: “Nicksick wants
to stay at Pitt. Charley and Mr.
Hagan want him at Pitt. I want
‘him at Pitt.”

As the News went to press, Nick-
sick, who is a little confused by the
excitement of approaching father-
hood within the next two weeks,

had nothing to say, but was still at
Pitt.

Completion of Cathedral  

Most pressing need of the University, in the opinion of the average.
student, is the completion of the interior of the Cathedral, ﬁnal results of

the Pitt News poll revealed today.

The questions used concerned the
eight—point expansion program pre-
sented by Chancellor John G. Bow-
man to the Board of Trustees last
month. In presenting his_plan the
Chancellor indicated that the proj-
ects would be carried out when
adequate funds would be available.

According to the Chancellor’s
plan, between $500,000 and $1,000,-
000 would be required to ﬁnance
completion of the Cathedral in-
terior. '

In answer to the question,
“Which of the projects of the
Chancellor’s eight-point expansion
program do you think should be
completed ﬁrst? Wrhich second?
Which third?—the students voted

Executive Secretary   if

Hammaker to Leave Johns Hopkins
University for New Office in April

‘«V_illia_1n _L. Hammaker," executive secretary of the Johns Hop-

kins University YMCA, has been named to the University YMCA I
executive secretaryship from which ‘N. W. Mendenhall resigned last.

August 15 to become director of religious activities at Cornell uni-

versity, Rufus H. Fitzgerald, University provost, disclosed today.

Chosen by a committee of six
a,dm.i11istration, student, and
metropolitan YMCA representa-
tives, 1\lr.'Hammaker will come
to the University in the latter
part of April. to assume manage-
ment of the YMCA. They have
been under the direction of Harold
Viehman, assistant and acting ex-
ecutive secretary, since September,
according to Dr. S. P. Franklin, pro-
fessor of religious education and
chairman of the committee.

Penn State Graduate

Mr. Hammaker graduated‘
from Pennsylvania State college in
1930 with bachelor of arts and
bachelor of science degrees. He at-
tended Union Theological seminary
and Columbia university, from-
which he obtained his 'master’s de-
gree in religious education.- ‘ E ' 4 5

Urban Williams, director of the
Metropolitan YMCA : and a : member '
of the committee of mariagemént‘
which selected Mr. Hamrnaker,‘an-'
nounced that he is “q'u-iteé happy
over the ﬁnal selection.” 1

Harold Viehman has known Mr.
Hammaker for several years
through contact in student and As-
sociation activities.

Commenting upon the selection,
Dr. Franklin stated, “Because of
Mr. Hammaker’s thorough educa-
tional training and experience in
YMCA work, and his record at
Penn State and John Hopkins, we
feel that he is just the man we need
here. His participation in student
affairs has given him an under-
standing of college students, a fac-
tor which is very important.”
Selected by Board

“He is at the rather fortunate age
where he is still climbing. He will
have an opportunity to grow with
the institution,” Dr. Franklin added.

Mr. Hammaker was born in Phila-
delphia in 1908. He is married.

.Members of the committee of
management reviewed the qualiﬁ-
cations of a number of applicants
over the summer and during this
semester, Dr. Franklin pointed out.
In addition to Dr. Franklin and Mr.
Williams, the committee included
Vincent W. Lanfear, dean of men;
Ralph W. Harbison of the down-
town YMCA; Robert Shaw, C41;
Edward Ammann, C40, president of
the YMCA; and Mr. Fitzgerald, act-

Three Recess
Social Events

Undergraduate members of the

includes a retreat, a luncheon meet-
ing, and a “hard times” party.

To relieve the tension of exam
week, members of the YWCA are
planning a retreat to Scout lodge,
North park, on Thursday and Fri-
day, January 25 and 26.

Purpose of the retreat is to de-
velop deﬁnite projects for next se-
mester’s YW activities. In addi-
tion there will be a program of
sports.

Because only 30 members can be
accommodated Betty Dils, Ed41,

Total price will be about $1.50
per person. '

their books at approximately two-
thirds of the selling price.

Owners of books sold are sent

NLRB to Courts ?

Madden Considered Eligible
For Judiciary By Faculty

By Fred Lange
J. Warren Madden, former pro-
fessor of law at the University and
present head of the National Labor
Relations Board, is considered

“highly recommendable” for a Fed-
eral judicial post, according to a
survey of faculty members.
Judson A. Crane, professor of
law, points out that the NLRB,
since Madden became chairman,
shows surprisingly few cases in its
many hundreds
in which the
courts have re-
versed the deci-
sion. “Only last
week,’ ’ said
Crane, “the Su-
preme again
sustained the
Board as against
the protest of an
AFL union.”
On his judicial
abilities, Crane
stated, “The best

Mr. Madden
test of manifestation of judicial
qualities-—the extent to which he
has been sustained by the appellate
courts—-amply support his quali-
ﬁcations.”

Mr. Crane pointed out that. as a
Federal Circuit judge, Madden
would deal only occasionally with

 

cases coming from the labor board
and, as a matter of judicial ethics,
he would probably decline to sit on
a case which had originated during
his term as Board chairman.

Dr. Elmer D. Graper, professor
and head of the political science
department. regards Madden as
“highly competent” and doing a
“highly satisfactory job with a dif-
ﬁcult task.”

Referring to press comments at-
tacking Madden, Mr. Crane said,
“To say that he is not qualiﬁed for
the Federal Bench because some
employers and labor organizations
are bad losers seems absurd.”

Dr. Francis D. Tyson, professor
of economics, agrees with Dr. Grap-
er and declares that Madden was
doing “a difficult job in a difficult
ﬁeld, well.”

Jacob J. Blair, assistant profes-
sor of economics, considered Mad-
den “fair, objective, with no evi-
dence of bias” who has “extended
an act into a new ﬁeld.

James B. Blackburn, professor of
law, assorted that the “mistakes”
of Madden were poor choices of as-
sistants, but that he had a “very
ﬁne mind.”

Albert B. Martin, graduate assist-
ant in political science, termed
press attacks, “Pollywash!”

Politics

 

Colunmist Finds Senatofs

   

i. ’
‘is’

 

Proposed

By Dave Hamilton

From the recent speech by Rob-
ert A. Taft, Republican senator
from Ohio presenting a budget to
President Roosevelt’s challenge,
two things are quite evident.

It is obvious, first, from the tone
of the speech that Mr. Taft felt that
President Roosevelt was “stick-
ing his neck out” when he chal-
lenged Taft to submit a balanced
budget, and, second, it is obvious
from the content of the speech, that

Mr. Taft’s neck was out so far that I

it was
portions.

Mr. Taft’s budget plan is quite
simple.

First. “The President must wish
and be determined to balance the
budget-—something Mr. Roosevelt
has no desire to do.” Here the Sen-
ator draws upon his powers as a
yogi to determine the thoughts of
the President. If he looks again
into his great crystal ball he might
be able to determine the thoughts
of the President concerning a third
term.

Reduce Bureaus

Second. “The President must
eliminate bureaus, reduce the num-
1' er of employees, and reorganize.”
To accomplish this  committee of
men possessing practical experience
in business and politics would be
appointed. A simple governmental
reorganization plan, proposed by the
Roosevelt administration and ade-
quate to accomplish the task, was
met and defeated by stiff opposi-
tion, the brunt of which came from
Mr. Taft’s own party.

As for the committee of practical
business men, Washington was full
of this hard headed species through-
out the l920’s when practicality
was the prerequisite for an entree
to the White House. We had a
crash in 1929;

Play No Favorites

Third, “Change methods of hand-
ling relief, housing. agriculture, and
government loans.” Relief admin-
istration would be returned to the
states. The Senator is from Ohio
where relief administration has
been assumed by the state. Evi-
dently Mr. Taft is unaware of the
dire results in his own state or pos-
sibly he has taken this as an op-
portune time to remain away from
home.

Fourth, “End grants for local
public works, reduce Federal public
works. and reduce Federal sub-
sidies.” According to Mr. Taft this

assuming giraffe-—l.ike pro-

 iidget U nsoimd

type of aid has conditioned the peo-
ple to expect support from the gov-
ernment, thus killing individual
iniative. Shades of the philosophy
of rugged individualism! Maybe
Senator Taft still believes enough
in the “survival of the ﬁttest” to
suggest a return to the woods,
acorns and loin cloths.

Relief from Ohio

Fi:=th, “Play no favorites; subject
Army and Navy estimates to crit-
ical analysis.” We agree. How-
ever, we reserve the right to doubt
the sincerity of Mr. Taft on this
point due to the fact that his GOP
Colleagues pass Army and Navy
appropriations without the usual
vociferous opposition that is ﬂung
against most New Deal appropria-
tion bills.

As for the balanced budget as a
whole it is not a budget. It is no
more than an ennumerated series
of generalized statements concern-
ing points at which the budget
might be reduced. This economy
block talk. is nothing more or less
than stereotyped campaign propa-
ganda, which is thrown to the peo-
ple before all elections.

Mr. Roosev«elt’s ne-ck is not in
danger from the Ohio corner, but it
might be advisable for Mr. Taft to
start to reel in his neck immedi-
ately.

Our congratulations to the Inde-

again due to the annual burst of

Plug for Druids

All year long we wondered why
Ray Light kept calling the Owl of-
flee to tell Puss Letsche to pick up
his daily mail . . As a couple Of
Druid alumni, we greatly admire
the new Druid policies and hope
they will be adhered to and that
the purpose behind them» will not
be sacriﬁced. ‘ 2

Exam Advice

By Gertrude Lieblich

Latest advices from the Orient
reveal that the word “exam” comes
from an old Phoenician word mean-
ing “the mis’ries.”

In regard to that special kind of
misery known as True—False tests,
there is a simple rule to follow.
“Every second question is true un-
less every third question is false
unless every fourth question, etc.”
This is all very well for persons
who can remember the rule. All
others are urged to follow their
secret hearts.

To Split Hairs

A second and more intelligible
recommendation for taking True-
Faalse tests is to study your prof.
as you would your textbook. Is he
the hair-splitting type? Then, split
hairs with him. Is he the 1ive-and-
let-live type? Then, the majority
of the statements on the test will
be true.

In conclusion, we have two tragic
examples to hold up to the public
gaze. The ﬁrst concerns a junior
who was expelled from a big east-
ern college for cribbing. It seems
that he was caught counting his
ribs during a physiology exam.

The second sorry incident con-
cerns the History professor in a
big western college who asked the
same question on his ﬁnal exam
every year. Every student on
campus had learned, from either
fraternity ﬁles or independent
grapevine, that this prof., without
fail, would ask his students to name
ﬁve kings and queens of Egypt.

Five Kings

The answer to be given was “Five
kings and queens of Egypt are
Menes, Hatshepsut, Ikhnaton, etc.”
Well, one year he asked a different
question and stumped all the mem-
bers of the class—all except one
bright lad. This senior wrote on
his paper, “Dear Prof: I do not
know the answer to the question
you asked. But the ﬁve kings and
queens of Egypt are Menes, Hat-
shepsut, Ikhnaton, etc.”

Phi Kaps Top SAE, Theta Chi
F lattens Phi Eps in Basketball

Fraternity basketball again dom-
inated the intramural schedule
Wednesday and Thursday.

The favorites came through with
scores to prove their superiority.
The undefeated and last year’s
champions, Phi Kaps, won an im-
pressive 38-10 game over the SAE
quintet. The SAE’s team proved
no match for the Phi Kaps as Hal-
loran and Glenn played outstand-
ing ball.

Theta Chi led by Edgar “Special
Delivery” Jones and “Wild Bill”
Fitchko swamped the Phi Ep cag-
ers, 32-8.

The highly touted Phi Gams
boosted their undefeated streak to
ﬁve games as they tripped the not-
so-highly touted Kappa Sig team,
24-15.

In the only upset of the evening,
the Phi Delts swamped the Lambda
Chi ﬂoormen. Robinson and Dun-
bar of the Phi Delts played spec-

Pitt F ivc Faces
Skibo Cagers

Riding the comeback trail with
three wins in four starts, the Pitt
basketball team takes on a fading
Carnegie Tech ﬁve Wednesday
night on the Stadium court.

The Panthers will be heavy fav-
orites to smear the Skibos, chieﬂy
on the basis of their comparative
scores against Westminster. While
Carnegie suﬁered a lﬁve point de-
feat, the Carlsonmen ran the Titans
silly, 47-35.

Chief hope of the Plaid will be
gangling Bob Stark who is rolling
along with a 17 point per game av-
erage. Jimmy Tumpane, veteran
forward, may help but has been an
inconsistent performer all season.

The other three Tech starters will
be chosen from a group which in-
cludes Kermit Patton, Johnny
Burke, Red Sturgeon, Holetz, and
Burch. The latter several times has
been a shot in the arm to Tartan
hopes.

Pitt will open with Straloski, Col-
lins, Kocheran, Port, and either
Milanovich or Pataky. Sophomores
Ziolkowski and Egan will do shock
troop duty. 1

Jack Scherer and Charley Ptacek,
both seniors, will also see consid-
erable action for the Jungle Cats. . .

Table tennis matches were at a
minimum on Wednesday and
Thursday, as only two matches were
played. The PiKA team won over
the SAM team, 8-4, and the Kappa
Sigs whitewashed the Sigma Chis,

In handball, the Kappa, Sig team
won the only game played by a

Dedication Date

The Polish, nationality room will
be dedicated February 16, Dr.
Chester S._ Sierakowski, chairman
of the Polish committee has an-
nounced.

ality room to be completed. It will

‘ be the third to be dedicated since

Adolf Szyszko-Bohusz, one of
Poland’s distinguished architects,
designed the classroom and Mr. and
Mrs. Waclaw Szymborski, sister
and brother—in—law of the designer,
painted the beamed ceilings and
decoration for the room last year.
The painters, who were employed
by the Polish government to repaint
the tremendous ceilings of the halls
in castles that the government re-
stored after the World war, were
given a leave of absence in order
to come to Pittsburgh.

Ignace Jan Paderewski, famed
concert pianist, composer, and the
former premier of Poland, present-
ed the manuscript of his only
opera, “Manru,” to the University,

‘No Life So Happy’ by Peterson

“No life so happy” wrote Isaac
Walton in the “Compleat Angler”
over 300 years ago when he de-
scribed the pleasures of ﬁshing.
This year Walton’s phrase will be
the title of a forthcoming book by
Edwin L. Peterson, assistant pro-
fessor of English, to be. published
by Dodd, Mead, and company.

Termed by the author “a tome
on trout ﬁshing,” this book. origin-
ally started as a technical manual
on the art of ﬂy‘-casting.‘ Inclusion
of essay material along with the
technical data caused the author to
revise his manuscript and make it
primarily essay with a ‘bit of the
original plan still included.

Mr. Peterson, who is called “an V
expert, though not always success-
ful ﬁsherman,” has completed
proof-reading on his book and ex-
pects it will be published soon. ‘ '
