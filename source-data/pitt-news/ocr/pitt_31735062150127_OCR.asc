. There is a connotation to all words. To the
unfamiliar, Pitt connotes nothing more than a
football team, forty-two stories, and nationality

I‘OOII'lS.

We who are seniors at the University know
better.

We know that there is more to the Cathe-
dral than its height. We have found friend-
ship here, and warmth, and a mood that is of
Pitt alone.

As freshmen, we had but a vague concep-
tion of what was to be. We knew only that
things would be different from what they were
in high school. More liberty, we were told,
more responsibility, more dignity.

Since then we have learned to look behind
the facade.

Forty-two stories, of itself, means little.
Far more important is the idea of those forty-
two stories, the idea of a university as dedi-
cated to the interrelationships of all forms of

knowledge.

The nationality roms, of themselves, have
little signiﬁcance. More signiﬁcant is the con-
cept of knowledge as the heritage of all men
in all lands.

The Heinz chapel, of itself, is of no conse-
quence. Of greater import is the spiritual
value of the chapel, embodying, as it does, the

belief in the compatibility of the different in-

terpretations of the Creator, the belief that
man must be humble before he can become
great.

The bond here between teacher and student
is closer. There is a feeling of learning with,
rather than of learning from.

Student friendships are stronger. The ac-

tivities of fraternities, clubs, and associations
transcend the narrowness of mere cliques.

,In the classrooms, we have learned more
than the answers to questions. We have learned
the technique of research, of knowing what

   What It Will Mean to Your ,ons and Daughters   

questions to ask.

Outside of classes, we have had extra-cur-
ricular activities, which were more than imi-
tation-models of larger institutions. They
were lessons for later living, true, but they
were also ends in themselves.

Going to Pitt, then, is not merely a part of
the student’s life. It is a separate life in itself.

The Cathedral is a self—sufficient institution,
in which are made acquaintances and warm
companionships, in which people move about
in much the same complex way that they do
in the world outside.

This is not to imply that ours is a fenced-
off institution. Rather, it is a testing—ground
in which the mistakes of our lives may be
eliminated and the unnecessary pressures eased.
. We have been told that ours is a great school
in spite of its industrial surroundings.

. We believe that Pitt is great because of its
industrial surroundings. Ours is not a ClOlS-

tered school, off in the
reality. a

One does not learn to swim on dry lan_ T.
Located as we are in the heart of things Amer--%  '

ican, we are in a position to feel the pulse of
events as they happen.

To say that our doors are open to all classes -

and all types would be dull repetition." The
fact remains, nevertheless, that the ideal of...

higher education has changed from an aristo-.-3

cratic to a democratic one.
There is no aristocracy here, save of intel;

lect. Not every man a king, but every man a.   

potential heir to the throne of wisdom. 
We have been trained to the philosophy thatf
Education begets Truth, and Truth Beauty. V?
In a wealth-conscious world, it is heartene

ing to realize that our most precious possession, in .. 
the only thing that cannot be taken from--us [

when all else is gone, is our wisdom, our knowl-
edge, our education.

Honored Today
In Foster Hall

By George Chirigos
Approximately 10 per cent of the
freshman men—those who have
been outstanding in the ﬁrst eight
weeks of school—received golden
panther keys inscribed with their

0  class year‘ at‘ “th'e* an“r’ﬁ1al'»'Ir1eeting

of the judicial tribunal this after-
noon at 12:30 o’clock at Stephen
Foster Memorial.

The court, with black robed jus-
tices, bailiffs, clerks, and a sergeant-
at-arms, released the names of the
students who had been chosen to
receive the keys.

The students were selected on the
basis of their schloastic record, cus-
toms examination, grade, recom-
mendations of faculty and upper
class councillors, and participation
in activities.

Phi Eta Sigma, honorary fresh-
man scholastic fraternity, awarded
the placque given to the outstand-
ing scholar of last year’s freshman
class to William C. Kelley, ‘C43,
with a perfect 3.0 average. Aldo
Icardi, C43, president of Phi Eta

man men who this morning received
panther key awards, women of the
class of 1944 will attend their merit

Heinz Chapel

Has Services

For All-Faiths

By William Pankuch

Heinz Memorial chapel is one of
the lesser-known of our campus
buildings. Beautiful in form, in
architecture, and in depth of atmos-
phere, it is “just another church”
for many students.

After last year’s graduation cere-
monies, one student was seen cran-
ing his neck and mumbling, “So
this is Heinz chapel! I wonder why
I’ve never been in here before.”

Such situations need not exist,
since members of all religious sects
may attend any services, or may
secure the use of the chapel for a
denominational service. Dr. Wil-
liam Farmer, University Chaplain,
delivers a non—sectarian religious
talk each Sunday.

Any organization connected with
the University or its students may
hold their own type of service in
the Chapel. In some cases, off-
campus groups may also use the
facilities here provided.

Several organizations have held
their own services here during the
past year, although recently none
have sought permission. Newman
club, YWCA, and Student Luther
league are among those who have
availed themselves of this privilege
in the past, and others are urged
to do so now.

Applications for group use of the
Chapel may be presented to Miss
Helen Bachmann, Chapel hostess,
Provost Rufus Fitzgerald, or Dr.
Farmer.

Students who visit Heinz Chapel
may secure information concerning
the building from Miss Bachmann
or Joseph Grimm, student guide.
Daily organ recitals by Russell
Wichmann, University organist are
held each school day and are open
to the public.

Services Planned

For Thanksgiving

Since the University has declared
November 28 for the Thanksgiving
holiday in accordance with Gover-
nor Arthur H. James’ proclamation,
the student Thanksgiving Worship
service will be held in the chapel
at 12:40 o’clock next Wednesday.
Subject for Dr. Farmer’s address
will be “Beyond Thanksgiving.”

Chancellor Greets Parents

Of 1,350 Freshman Students

The largest‘ number of persons ever to attend a Chancellor’s
reception, approximately 1,350 parents of freshmen,»were the guests
of Dr. John G. Bowman tonight at the twentieth annual reception.

Freshman students themselves were not invited, emphasized Dr.
Vincent W. Lanfear, dean of men, chairman of the reception

committee.

Chancellor Bowman welcomed
his guests from a stage in the
Commons Room after introduc-
tory remarks by Dr. Lanfear.

Russell G. Wichmann, University

"T organist, ” played organ‘ selections

while parents, entering through the
Belleﬁeld entrance, gathered in the
Commons Room.

Following Dr. Bowman’s welcom-
ing address ,Women’s Choral under
the direction of Mrs. J. Fred Liss-
felt and accompanied by Norma
Jean Wilkes, BA42, entertained.

Selections chosen by the Choral
included: “Lift Thine Eyes,” Men-
delssohn; “A Lullaby,” from Josce-
lyn by Godard, including a violin
oblagato by Jean Lewis, C42;
“Peasant Wedding March,” “The
Silver Swan,” by Gibbons; “Sum—
mer Time” from George Gersh-
win’s Porgy and Bess; “Goin’
Home;” “Come Follow,” an old Eng-
lish canon; “When Daisies Tied,”
Thomas Arne; and “Glorious For-
ever.”

After each of the last few selec-
tions by the Choral, a group of
parents were escorted_ by student
aides to a temporary registrar’s of-
ﬁce on the ﬁrst ﬂoor of the Cathe-
dral where they obtained grade
cards.

After individual conferences be-
tween faculty members and par-
ents in rooms provided, the guests

gathered in the Common Room for
a social period during which re-
freshments were served.

Parents met other faculty mem-
bers and the deans of the under-
graduate schools, and discussed mu‘-
tual problems concerning students.

Student aides, chosen because of
service to the University, scholar-
ship, and leadership, ushered, acted

Student from Coventry Tells Story of  Failure
To Contact Relatives Trapped in Bombed City

Speaking so softly that it was
often difficult to hear her, diminu-
tive Jean Tipson, part-time student
at the University, whose home is in
Coventry, England, explained that
she had received no answer to the
cable she sent her parents and two
sisters at home.

Tears crowded the eyes of the
dark-haired young Englishwoman
as she spoke of her people and of
her home town which, several days
ago, suffered the worst aerial bom-
bardment inﬂicted on any city dur-
ing the war.

Her clear white complexion, de-
void of cosmetics, and framed in

By Jerry LeVine
The student quota of $2,700 for
the University Community fund and
Campus chest fell short by over
$700, according to ﬁgures released

late Wednesday by H. E. Daer, as-
sistant bursar of the University.

The intensive student drive of

ed included 2,098 undergraduates.
Of the $1,964.39 subscribed,
$1,016.48 was contributed in cash.
The remainder was pledged.

With 75 per cent of the faculty
and University employees still un-
solicited, the registrar’s ofﬁces re-
ports a total $1,764 subscribed as
of Wednesday morning. The facul-
ty drive will continue until Novem-
ber 29, deadline for the general
Community fund. Of the $10,000
University quota, the faculty amount
amount has been set at $7,300 and
the student amount $2,700. Total
subscription so far amounts to $3,-

Honorary Begins‘
Tutorial Service

Kenneth Garver

To help freshman men and women
who are having difficulties with their
subjects, Phi Eta Sigma, honorary
scholastic fraternity for freshman
men, plans to resume free tutorial
service, announces Aldo Icardi, C43,
president. A

Over 30 members of the national
fraternity, who have a quality point
average of 2.5 or over, will tutor
any freshman who is having diffi-
culty with certain subjects.

English skins mentioned in make-

Jean came to America in May,
1939, to spend her summer vaca-
tion, but at the outbreak of hostil-
ities in September, her parents
wired her instructions to remain.

As far as air—raid protection is
concerned, Coventry has no sub-
ways, and special shelters had to be
hurriedly constructed out of the
many wine—cellars in the lower parts
of the city. . ,

Jean feels that, in comparison to
the letter she received from home,
the accounts of the bomb devasta-
tion in American newspapers are
fairly accurate.

Her parents’ failure to reply may
be due to the fact that communica-

The Spanish Civil War I

For Whom the Bells Toll, Ernest Hemingway

No man is an Iland, intire of it selfe; every man
is a peeoe of the Continent, a part of the maine; if
a Clod bee washed away by the Sea, Europe is the
lesse, as well as if a Promontorie were, as well as
if a Manner of thy friends or of thine owne were:
any mans death diminishes me, because I am in-
volved in Mankinde; And. therefore never send to
know for whom the bell tolls; It tolls for thee.

From these lines of John Donne, Ernest Heming-
way has taken the title for his latest book. He, like
T. S. Eliot, has reached back into Elizabethan meta-
physics for better words to apply to our world, a
world this time peopled with Spanish Loyalists.

Mr. Hemingway’s premise seems to be that if truth
is as Chekhov says, “Absolute and honest truth,” then
a dead man is not really dead until you club the life
out of him, starting at the face so that the blue goo
from his smashed eyes can attract the Spanish ﬂies in
the dusty sunshine. But this is not primarily a war
horror story. Dead is dead. Ice is ice and all the
freezing you do won’t make it any icier. Mr. Heming-
way has a way of exhausting sensually every object
he sees, living or dead. But you can see it, and you
can smell it, too. The quite average human being is
a little relieved on ﬁnishing this book to be allowed to
settle back into his superﬁcial daily quota after be-
ing led around by the nose through 471 pages of
strenuous living.

Mr. Hemingway’s Side

And now for Mr. Hemin.gway’s side. It’s a good

thing for many subway riders to be jerked out of their

inertia and to have their noses rubbed in “dung and
death.” (T. S. Eliot: Very applicable here.) In a
manner of speaking, if you can housebreak enough peo-
ple, you may have a pretty decent world. But you
can at least show them ugliness vicariously so that
when they see it in reality, they won’t faint.

And here Mr. Hemingway really shines. There’s
work to be done, he says. There are revolutions to be
won or lost. There’s a time for love and there’s a
time for work. Jump into both with your feet kick-
ing until you’ve won or died. If you win, get up and
start kicking something else; the world is full of things
to be kicked.

So if you’re up to it, try stringing along with Rob-
ert Jordan in his four fast days with’ the Loyalists.
You’ll like his crop headed guapa, Maria. You’ll meet
Pilar, a lot of woman with few scruples and plenty
of devotion to the cause. You can see the refreshingly
pure minded Anselmo who lives and dies an idealist.
But everything for a cause. This is a book for a cause.
——-Phillip Lee Crittenden Jr.

The Great Crusade, Gustav Regler

Hemingway “made-up” a great novel about the
Spanish Civil War; Gustav Regler has recorded in his
autobiographical novel, The Great Crusade, the raw
material that Hemingway has used.

Hemingway says in his preface to Regler’s book,

“But there are events which are so great that if a Writer »

has participated in them his obligation is to try to
write them truly rather than to assume the presump-
ion of altering them with invention.
this importance that have produced Regler’s book.”

Regler was a writer before the Spanish War. -He
had fought fascism at home in Germany. Then he
left. “He had attended his country’s universities, but
he was suddenly ashamed to hold a degree given him
by institutions that let a Gumbel, the exposer of foul
vehmic, be spat upon, that drove out an Einstein, that
cut off the world reputation of its men of learning with
low epithets.”

He went to France and to Spain. As an anti—fascist
he was commissar of the 12th International Brigade in
Spain. He fought with the brigades in the heroic bat-
tles of Madrid until he was wounded. That is the con-
tent of the book: the battles around Madrid: and the
men who fought them. I

The Story

The book tells of Regler, of the brigades’ Hungarian
General Lukasz, of German Doctor Werner Heilbrunn
who helped organize and run the Brigade’s medical
corps, of Prussian Commander Hans, and of Italian
General Pacciapprdil. Regler writes the battles of the
brave German, Polish, French, and Italian brigades:
the battle of Guadalajara and the Garibaldi brigade
and the suspense of the propaganda loudspeakers and
the Abyssinian Garibaldi who wanted “Commander, I
go out Mussolinis’ throat now?”, the massacre of the
French by the Moors, an intense battle; and the stand

of Janek and the Polish Dombrowski brigade at Ar-

ganda, against the Moors.

The Spanish Civil War is now appreciated by the
Democracies, and their imperturbable leaders. Perhaps
you democrats had better catch up on your reading.

The book is all action. I read it straight through.
You can get it in the Alldred Room. J. deBenedictis. ‘

Athens to Hollywood

By Charles Camarata.

Having come, bag and baggage, down the long cor-
ridors of history from Egypt to Athens to Florence to
London, Paris, and Berlin, culture is now making a
hasty exit from the backdoors of Europe to America.
The direction of its journey is west. Historians tell us
this is so, and the increasing number of intellectual
refugees to this country proves it. This is as it should
be, for it embraces the basic tenets of “Go west, young
man, go west.”

We hypochondriacs of the human spirit view with
satisfaction the inevitable next-stop of culture in Hol-
lywood. We await the enchantment of Beethoven en...
riched with a few bars of “Beat Me Daddy.” The
prima ballerina of the ballet we will encore with
bravoes of “Take it off!” We will tune in on poets,
playwrights, and authors who will sings their staccato
muses like Walter Winchell and who will usually be
back in a ﬂash with some more trash. The books on
our shelves will be classics on the root stems of such
noises as gaga, nerts, and ﬁoozie.

And this is all as it should be, because if culture has
seen ﬁt to come to America, it is only cricket that we

Eds Consume
Sandwiches
In Tuck Shop

By Irving Leiber

It’s a place “where the fellows
gather, converse, eat, smoke, read,
and play cards, chess and checkers.
These are the things which happen
many times each day in the Men’s
Tuck shop on the eighth ﬂoor.

Every day Pitt men consume in
the men’s tuck shop on the average
of four hundred varied sandwiches,
six hundred bottles of liquid re-
freshment, eighty apples, one hun-
dred pies, three hundred and ﬁfty
home packed lunches, and numer-
ous unclassiﬁed items. The tables
in the men’s tuck shop aren’t cov-
ered with linens, they have no sil-
verware to speak of, but every ﬁfth
hour there is standing room only.

The junior size radio perched on
the unplastered wall plays continu-
ously while seniors, freshmen, fra-
ternity men, and independents read
and re-read every magazine from
the “Down Beat” to “The Ladies
Home Journal.” They out-maneu-
ver each other at chess and check-
ers, catch “forty—winks” on those
spacious leather davenports, discuss
their last dates, cram for a sixth
hour quiz, smoke another bowl of
a friend’s favorite mixture, set their
opponent by ten tricks, relax and
feel like BMOC’s and collaborate
with George Something-or-other on
the math assignment.

“The men’s tuck shop, offers the
university men a personal place
where they are free to do as they
wish,” states Bill Kofmehl, man-
ager of the shop which is operated
by the office of the dean of men.

Dr. Ferguson Pens
Letter of Thanks

Editor, the Pitt News:

Not that the following is of any
great signiﬁcance, yet some there
may be who will be interested to
learn that the temporarily-disabled

, professor is at last out of the hos-

pital, and hopes to take over at
least one of his classes by the end
of this week.

To those students who telephoned
their condolencesfor who called in
person at the sick room, or whose
entrance was barred by hard-
hearted nurses, or who all too gen-
erously sent ﬂowers and cigarettes,
or who remembered the patient
with greeting cards or notes, I con-
fess myself very grateful.

Despite the intelligent services of
ten nurses it was no great fun over
at the West Penn. It’s grand to be
at liberty once more.

JOHN M. FERGUSON,
professor of economics.

iLions Invade
City to Claw
Jungle Cats

, By Ben Foote
Answering the ominous roar
of a powerful Nittany Lion, a
determined Panther screams a
deﬁant challenge from its Sta-

. dium lair as the Pitt eleven await

the invasion of the unconquered

-Penn State gridmen, tomorrow aft-
_ ernoon.

According to the form charts, a
tight struggle will ensue. Not since
the halcyon days of the post—war
era has the State College institu-
tion trotted out so glittering an
array of football talent as this year,
and the esteem for the local squad
has mounted high since the gallant
Nebraska ﬁght. Betting odds stand
9-8, and take your choice.

» Of great importance in weighing
the. possibility of a Pitt victory is
the condition of Edgar Jones, triple-
threat left halfback. Jones retired
from last Saturday’s struggle with

.-an injured eye, and although he’s

slated for active duty tomorrow, his
passing eye may yet be impaired.
Should he be unable to return to

his old post, Jack Stetler, the bril-

liant sophomore halfbacking ﬁnd,

.will again perform Jones’s chores.
_In any event, the shifty yearling

Freshmen Open
Cage WOPKOUIS

By Jerry Ripp
Under the watchful eye of Dr.

.Paul Zehfuss, freshman basketball

drills began last Monday in the Sta-
dium pavilion.

Among those who reported for
the opening session were Bob Aiken,
Harry Abramovitz, Sam Barﬁeld,
Bob Beck, Sam Brungo, Lloyd Carl-
son, Ed Cowden, Walt Eneschenko,
Frank Hettler, Franklyn Lewis,
Irwin Greenberg, Walter Jones,
James Manning, Harry Mathews,

Joe Segal, Charles Schnurrer, Ste-

phen Shuber and David White. Of
these, Zehfuss; said that Carlson,
Cowden, Eneschenko, Mathews and
Shuber showed the most promise of
developing into future floor stars.
Inasmuch as there is no freshman
basketball schedule, Zehfuss said

that all boys interested in playing

basketball, even if they only wanted
to play to get some exercise out of

it, should report to the Stadium

ﬂoor. _
If enough fellows report, a Fresh-
man league will be formed and the

teams will play against each other.

Dr. Zehfuss urged that all who re-
port _be sure to bring a sweater
along, as well as a sweatshirt, since
it gets pretty cold up there.

Until enough men report to formi

a league, however, the drills will
consist mainly of teaching the fun-
damentals of the ﬂoor sport to the
prospective hoopsters.

News Names

By Alex Zelenski
Repeating their last year’s mast-
ery over their opponents, the Punks
and Phi Gamma Delta have again

walked away with top honors in the
Pitt News mythical all-intramural
team, each placing two men on the

first squad‘ and one on‘ the ‘second

team.

Outstanding player of the season
was a veteran of the championship
Phi Gam team, Paul MacNeil. The
captaincy of this dream team goes
to MacNeil for his unsung service
in the Fiji cause for four years.
MacNei1 was an essential cog in his
team’s success, his offensive block-
ing and defensive line charging
were the talk of the I-F league.
Mitchell Effective

Another Fiji who stirred the I-F
circuit was Mike Mitchell. Mitchell
was not supposed to be able to ﬁll
the shoes of all-intramural Chris
Watson, but the results show him

Freshmen Start
In Intramural

Touch Football

By John Maxfield

The intramural lineups of most
of the independent and fraternity
touch football teams this year have
been dotted with the names of up
and coming stars as a direct indi-
cation of the part the “class of ’44”
plans to play in the all-intramural
selections of future years.

Whitey Carlson, PiKA and a can-
didate for the freshman basketball
team, is the outstanding freshman
in this division of the sports pro-
gram. He received honorable men-
tion on the all-intramural selections
for his ability in tossing and catch-
ing passes.

The fraternity runners up, Phi
Kappa, have one outstanding fresh-
man‘ pass receiver in Kelly. Red
Patterson, Chem Engineer and a
high school class-mate of Carlso_n’s
is another who can toss the pig-
skin with great skill. ’

The Sammies have as their block- I

ing back Harry Abramovitch, an-
other candidate for the freshman
basketball team. One of the stand-
outs in the PiKA line this season is
Ralph Wilde, brother of all-intra-
mural Gus Wilde.

Another outstanding pass re-
ceiver is Kappa Sigma’s star end,
Harry Coon. Delt’s Henry Loutzen-
hiser stood out as the best freshman
defensive center, and as one of the
best linemen in the circuit. Lenny
Samuels, one of a number of good
halfbacks on the freshman football
squad, stood out well as a pass re-
ceiver for the Phi Eps.

“Irish” O’Connell proved his
worth at freshman camp and is now
starring for the Cherokees. Bee
Miller, another sensation from
freshman camp, is a stand-out for
the Golden Bears. Richard Clark,
who placed on the intramural list,
is a star on both offense and de-
fense for Theta Chi. The Phi
Lam’s had one outstanding lineman
in Mike Herman, who backs up the
line with the best in the league.

 

Frosh Gridmen Prepare 
For First Definite Test

Progress in the development of
freshman football recruits continues
at a rapid pace which will be ac-
celerated further next Wednesday
afternoon when the freshman grid-
ders meet their ﬁrst outside compe-
tition, the junior varsity.

After weeks spent in acquiring ,a
thorough grounding in fundament-
als, incessant drilling in blocking
and tackling, and practice in a few
basic plays, the freshmen have dem-
onstrated in long and tough scrim-
mage sessions just how sturdy a
foundation for future Pitt teams
Coach Charley Bowser can expect.

Outstanding prospects have de-
veloped rapidly in the Panther
drills. Tackles Joe Salvucci and
Jack Durishan and guards Joe
Brody and Marsh Morgan have
shown strength in the middle of the

line, though they are only a step,

ahead of a ﬂock of aggressive line-
men including Crytzer, Stitt, La
Monaca, Ramsey, Critchﬁeld, Cos-
tello and Mueller. Two more big
and tough tackles are Manners and
Brimsek, the ﬁrst at 235 pounds the
biggest man on the squad, the latter
the newest, most spirited, and wild-
esrh recruit: of the high-spirited
freshman squad.

Center Jim Clawes, graduate of
Bobby Larue’s Shadyside team, is a
smart line backer and a steady pivot
man. He has to be good to stay
ahead of McAleese and Lloyd, the
latter a converted sandlot tackle
who has held his own with the high
school stars.

The supply of ends seems unlim-
ited, with Olszewski, classed by Pitt
coaches as one of the best punters
ever to come up to the practice
ﬁeld, battling with Mike Sotack,
Marty Rosepink, Mitch Sinco, Gest-*
ner and Pierre for the inside track
to future Pitt varsities.

All-Intramural Stars
MacNeill Captains Mythical Team

to be more eﬁective as a passer
than was Chris. Mitchell completed
more passes than any other player
in the intramural ranks.

In the independent stronghold the
Punks gave two stellar performers
to the intramural team in Lefty
Ziolkowski and Sam Milanovich.
This is the second consecutive year‘
that both boys have made the team.

Ziolkowski is essentially a passer,
and has thrown more touchdown
passes than any other pitcher this
season. He reached his climax last
week in the ﬁnals with the Golden
Bears when he threw ﬁve touch-
down passes to teammates.

Milanovich at Center
“Big Sam” Milanovich receives

the center post because of his de-,.

fensive line play. In addition to
being a great lineman, Milanovich
is Ziolkowski’s number one pass
receiver.

Phi Epsilon Pi’s contribution to
the all-intramural team is big,

bulking Arnie Biron, one of the four
man-mountains of the Phi Ep line.
Biron is one of the hardest blockers
in intramural play, and opposition
backﬁelds throughout the season
have known the plague of his line
charging.

Bob Black, speedy end of Phi
Delta Theta’s successful team, re-
ceives a line post because of his re- ’
markable knack for catching passes.
The Phi Delts’ poor passing handi-
capped Black’s scoring record, but
if a pass was anywhere near its
mark “Blackie” had it.

Jack Glenn, Phi Kappa’s one and
only, is the triple threat man of
the ﬁrst team. He place kicks, he
runs, he passes, and he punts with
equal success.

Pitt backﬁeld prospects are of
high calibre. Although Eddie
Skladany’s withdrawal from school
hurts, Bruce Reuter has stepped in-
to the left halfback slot and showed
the way to the other line smashers.
Reuter is a 160-pound ﬂash whose
drive in the open ﬁeld has enabled
him to break away for several long
runs in recent scrimmages.

Pitt backs are smart, too. Little
quarterback Ripple is still in the
heat of the competition, and any-
one who can match his 139 pounds
with the bruisers must be smart.
Scatton and Economos are still the
leading signal-callers, while Bob
Smith’s passing and Kerr’s line
slashing have been other bright

spots in this continuous process of
moulding a good Pitt freshman
squad.

_ By Jean Garland
 i  y; The ﬁrst in a series of SFA con-
‘ 4 9ﬂ;gcerts was launched by Alton Jones,
. bnoted pianist, Wednesday afternoon
, » in the Foster memorial.
.4 A Appearing for the ﬁrst time in
 , Pittsburgh, the soloist chose a di-
 gversiﬁed program of Debussy,
= },,.Chopin, Haydn and Field. In the
J .  Chopin B-Flat Minor piano Sonata,
,Mr. Jones displayed his technique
‘and ﬁne musical understanding and
. i temperament. Possessing well-
tr  rounded robust tones, he dazzled
S  the audience with the brilliant Pres-
_ “to movement and the widespread
 . chords of the familiar Marche Fune-
« bre. In the Haydn Variations in F
7 Minor, the artist showed a feathery
 I ulightness in touch and the variations
 were set off from each other with
’ if; ‘ clarity‘; and skill.
 gAlton Jones played through this
 program with brilliance, ﬁne dra-
matic power and tenderness which
“won the immediate approval of the
‘ audience. The pianist also gracious-
fly offered two encore numbers, a
Bolero’ by Casella and the familiar
[Brahms Lullaby.

Block to Climax Year
With ‘Best Show Yet’

To top off another successful sea.-
son, Pitt’s Demonstrations Block
plans to give a. perfect perform-
ance at tomo-rrow’s game. This is
the hope of Bill Morton, C41, and
Betty Sapp, C42, co-managers of
the block.

During the second quarter of
the Penn State game, the block
will form a “P-S” on a diagonal
ﬁeld. While the Pitt Band forms
the outline of the state of Penn-
sylvania at the half, the same de-
sign will be arranged by the block
with a large “S” of white paper
occupying the center.

Magazine Rates
By William Miller

Full-time students and graduates
who are registered for employment
through the Men’s Placement bu-
reau may obtain a special subscrip-
tion rate for a new quarterly per-
taining to occupations, personnel
and placement, announces Edward
B. Williams, director of the bureau.

“School and College Placement”
is the periodical published by the
Pennsylvania Association of School
and College Placement. Regular
rate is $2, but students may obtain
a year’s subscription for $1.

Dr. C. E. Clewell of the University
of Pennsylvania is president of the
association. Dr. John G. Bowman,
chancellor, is honorary vice-chair-
man of the committee on contribut-
ing and sustaining memberships

and Mr. Williams is a member of
the executive board.

This magazine should be of spe-
cial value to seniors who have not
yet reached a decision regarding
after-college employment, and to
undergraduates who have not found
a ﬁeld of specialization, Mr. Wil-
liams states.

News Service Makes Big Fish
Out of Little (Ines in Pitt Pond

By Robert Page

Small town talk: “Yes, sir, Joe
became a college fella and got into
that exclusive Greek fraternity. I
knew he’d make good.”

Or maybe: “Gracie’s one of those
honorary battery captains of the
Pitt ROTC.’

Whenever you do something here
at the University-—join a fraternity,
become a ROTC oﬂicer, serve on a
dance committee, take part in a
play, or some other little thing—

the ‘folks back home know about it “

by way of the hometown paper. The
local newspaper gets the news in
the form of a publicity release from
the University News Service.

The service, directed by Robert
X. Graham, maintains a hometown
department which sends out news
to all local papers in Pennsylvania,
,Ohio, and any other district that is
the hometown of a Pitt student.

Thus, the people in Library, Pa.,
read in the South Hills News that
“Grace McCombs, Library student,
who is a senior in the School of Ed-

ucation at the University of Pitts-
burgh, has been appointed an hon-
orary cadet “officer of the Pitt ROTC
regiment.”

Out in Illinois, the natives know
that “George Gregg, Panther car-
toonist, Oak Park student at the
University of Pittsburgh, was
pledged to Delta Tau Delta, nation-
al social fraternity recently. Gregg,
sophomore in the School of Business
Administration, is the son of Mr.
and Mrs. George R. Gregg of 940
Linden avenue.” They read it in the
Oak Leaves, local weekly.

Length of the hometown stories
varies with the importance of the
event the student is participating in
or the position he has acquired.
Some stories are only a column-
inch long; others might be two or
three column spreads with pictures.

The stories are gathered and writ-
ten by ﬁve student assistants in the
News service ofﬁce: Gee Skinner,
E41; Melissa Mae Gilmore, C44;
Margaret Coulson, C42; William
Patrick, C41, and William Ollis,
C43.

To the average University student
who knows little about physics,
Thaw hall is a building where en-
gineers and pre—dents attend classes
because certain subjects taught
there are required for degrees. But
behind those gray walls are things
more important than lectures, ex-
ams, and student experiments.

Thaw hall every day is the scene
of experiments which help to im-
prove the life of every American.

The physicists, whom we have all
pictured as absent-minded scientists
puttering around in their labora-
tories with unknown forces, are
really active, alert workers who‘
solve many practical problems.
Throughout the United States labor-
atories like those at Thaw hall are
developing theories which are indis-
pensable to metallurgists and engi-
neers.

The physics department, headed
by Dr. Elmer Hutchisson, is making
a special effort to develop those
ﬁelds of research which are useful
in the industrial community. A
“physics of metals” laboratory
headed by Dr. C. S. Smith, instruc-
tor in physics, and Dr. Millard
Manning, professor of physics, has
been established to study the elec-
tronic structure of the metals and
alloys, creep, internal friction and
the mechanism of solid state reac-
tions.

In the x-ray laboratory under Dr.
S. S. Sidhu, physicist in charge of
the co—operative x-ray laboratory,
metal castings are tested for defects,
complex compounds are identiﬁed
by their crystal structures and ap-

paratus for radiotherapy is tested.

In the spectroscopic laboratory,
directed by Dr. Mary E. Warga,
physicist in charge of the spectro-
scopic laboratory, new methods are
being developed for checking the
chemical speciﬁcations on certain
alloys and for obtaining “bird’s-
eye view” analyses of faulty mater-
ials, particularly alloys, to deter-
mine the cause of the faults.

The work of Dr. A. G. Worthing,
professor of physics, on the radia-
tion of energy from heated tungsten
ﬁlaments is internationally known.

In the nuclear physics laboratory,
headed by Dr. A. J. Allen, associate
professor of physics, in cooperation
with Dr. S. J. Simmons, senior re-
search fellow in physics,» artiﬁcially
radioactive elements are used as
tracers incorporated in certain com-
pounds. Then the reactions of these
compounds are followed by tracing
the “tagged” element.

Thus physics is not merely a
course full of big words. and long
experiments; it is an important part
