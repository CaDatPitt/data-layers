One of America ’s greatest student newspapers — since 1906

VOLUME XCVIII, NUMBER 104

Doctor says mad

cow not

AMY CHIAVERINI
Staff Writer

The only known way to kill the
agent that causes mad cow disease is to
soak it in Clorox.

But don’t wony; according to 
Robert Y. Moore, mad cow disease is
not arisk now or in the future.

And at Pitt, according to a Jan. 9
statement issued by Pitt’s food provider,
Sodexho, steps are being taken to guar-
antee the safety of its products. The
company’s suppliers must pass an armu—

' al inspection by an independent third
party hired by Sodexho.

Sodexho prohibits the use of parts
of the animal associated with mad cow
disease and also does not use downer
cows, which are diseased or dying cows
that are unable to walk.

Moore discussed the background of ,

the disease at a , gathering of the
Neuroscience Club on Tuesday evening
in Clapp Hall. Moore, a professor of
neurology and neuroscience at Pitt, gave
an informal lecture to spread awareness
of mad cow disease.

According to the Associated Press,

more than 30 countries banned U.S. beef .

after the federal government conﬁrmed
a Canadian Holstein slaughtered on
Dec. 9 as the ﬁrst case of mad cow dis-
ease in the United States.

According to Moore, mad cow dis-
ease, or bovine spongiform encephalo-
lathy (BSE), is a fatal brain disorder that
occurs in cattle and causes brain cells to

a threat

die, forming sponge-like holes in the
brain. -
Humans can contract the disease by
eating nervous system tissue ‘from
, infected cows. The human form is called
Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD), and
dementia is the chief symptom.

BSE and CJD are caused by the
reproduction of abnormal proteins in the
brain called prions, which carmot be
killed by cooking or freezing. The dis-
ease can lie dormant for several years,
but once it becomes active, it runs its
course -in nine to 12 months.

Similar diseases have been a prob-
lem in the United Kingdom since 1910,
when the government formed a board of
inquiry to look into scrapies, a related
disease found in sheep. In the 1980s,
producers of cattle feed used ground
meat and bone meal from infected
sheep, causing an outbreak of BSE in
cows. The United Kingdom has since
changed the way its producers process
feed. ' ,

Moore does not think mad cow.dis-
ease will be an issue in the future.

Martin Millner, general manager of
Sodexho Campus Services, agreed. C

“I think students just need to go
with what the folks at the USDA are say-
ing,” Millner said of "a report from the
United States Department ' of
Agriculture. .

The USDA is closely monitoring
the meat supply here, as well as imports
from other countries, and the department
says that risk is low at this time.

SGB proposes online professor profiles

JONATHAN M. KYLE
Staff Writer

The tumultuous process of choosing the
best classes for the coming semester may soon
be made easier, thanks to a new service being
considered by the Student Government Board.

As promised’ in his campaign, board
member Joe ‘Pasqualichio is proposing that

‘ SGB create an account with Pick-A—Prof, a

Web site that allows students to have their say
about potential professors. Pasqualichio put in
a request for funding on Monday, and he
expects to have the account up and running by
the time students begin registering for next
fall’s classes. '

“We post the grade history of professors,”
said Pick-A-Prof’s Director of University
Relations Karen Bragg. The company reads
all reviews of professors sent to them, and as
long as the submissions are not obscene or a
personal attack, every review is posted

Students will receive a reason and chance
to revise their reviews if they are not posted,

~ according to Bragg. The service also includes

a schedule planner and a section for professors

_ to post their biographies and class expecta-

trons.
Pick-A—Pmf currently serves 56 college
campuses across the United States. The ser-
vice allows the student government of each
school involved. to customize its service.

Music 0844 to make an encore presentation next year

about Ringo?” Brodbeck joked.

He said the lead singer was John
Lennon and that, by the end of the
semester, the class should be able to dis-
tinguish between each Beatle’s vocal
styling.

Welcome to Music 0844: The Music
of The Beatles, a bona ﬁde, three—credit
course dedicated to the legendary rock
‘n’ roll band. 

‘This is a way for us in the music
department to provide what we hope is a
good, solid introduction to listening to
music through a repertoire that will have

an immediate appeal [to students] and is
very rich and worth exploring, in any
case,” Brodbeck said.

This is the .ﬁrst semester Pitt has
offered the course, although Brodbeck
has taught about The Beatles in Major
Composer, a class that studies, a different
composer each semester, and has led an
undergraduate seminar about the group.

The Music of The Beatles explores
the “life and works” of the band.

‘ The “works” aspect includes an
examination of the structures and
melodies of their songs, how their music
evolved during the course of their career,
and distinctions between the band’s three
songwriters, Lennon, Paul McCartney
and George Harrison.

Although many students will have
fun learning about popular music, they

, will not escape evaluations. Brodbeck

The “life” aspect includes the band’s_

history, their formative inﬂuences (such
as R&B “girl groups,” including the

Marvelettes), and the group’s impact on '

1960s youth culture.

expects students to complete a ﬁnaland

a midterm exam as well as to write sum- .

in six “listening quizzes.”

The class fulﬁlls the music or art
general education requirement for the
School of Arts and Sciences’ students.
Because of this, Brodbeck has ensured
that it teaches basic music appreciation.

“Students are getting an introduction
ongto how to approach art meaningfully,”
he said. “In a music course, this means
‘How can we go beyond having music

_ be something we enjoy as an ambient

noise, but rather something we can listen

to carefully and understand how it is put «

999

T together. _ ‘

“I teach a lot of basic' music-listen-
ing skills, skills that I hope will be useflﬂ
to students whether they arelistening to"
The Beatles or other rock ‘n’ roll, or
whether they ﬁnd themselves in Heinz

Hall, listening to classical music,” he

said. , _
This ‘semester, every seat in the
class, of which there were more than
100, was ﬁlled.
“It sounded a lot more interesting
than the other options,” said Chrissy
Hedge, who took the class to fulfill her

music or art requirement.

Hedge said she was not a Beatles fan
before this semester, but the class has
taught her to appreciate their music. I

Another student, Kelly Markel, said
she enjoys the class and that it has taught
her music—listening skills. »

“There’s a lot of listening to things
you- don’t pay attention to normally --

details on form and stuff like- that,” she .

said. ' .
Brodbeck expects the course to
return next semester and said he is plan-
ning a class on the broader history of
rock ‘n’ roll. He said that these courses
represent a trend in Pitt’_s music depart-
ment. ,
“We are increasingly trying to
enlarge the kinds of music we offer in
the university setting, beyond narrowly
defined classical traditions and world
music traditions, but American popular
music traditions as well,” he said. ‘
Brodbeck’s love of The Beatles‘
began in 1964, when his older sister

broughfhome the single “I Want to Hold -
p Your Hand.” Since then, Brodbeck has

earned a doctorate in historical, musicol—

ogy and has written extensively about i

the composers Johannes Brahms and
Franz Peter Schubert, but he ﬁnds The
Beatles just as timeless and fascinating.

“At the end of the day, what draws
me’ back to The Beatles is that so many
of the songs just hold up so well,”
Brodbeck said. “They bear repeated
hearings because they are just so rich.”

“To this day, I will listen to a song I
have heard dozens and dozens and
dozens and dozens of times and hear
something I hadn’t noticed before,” he
said. “That’s always a good sign for a
piece of music that is going to stand up

Hell of a punishment for second grader

A second grader with a salty
mouth got one hell of a punishment
this week.

Brandy McKenith, 7, got suspend-
ed for one day from Sunnyside
Elementary in Stanton Heights. Her
offense?

After another student used the
phrase, “I swear to God,” she told her
classmate that such language would
result in a swift trip to hell.

For that, she got a punishment

more appropriate for a playground *

ﬁght. What about revoking her seesaw
privileges for the day? How about
denying her daily cookie allotment?
And whatever happened to the time-
out?

The school has a policy against
swearing, and apparently it’s zero-tol-
erance. So McKenith wound up in the
principal’s office, then got handed a
suspension.

She wasn’t using the word in a
profane context, though. She meant it
to refer to a location. Would she have
been suspended if the location had
been different? What if she told her
classmate, “You’re going to Cleveland
for swearing to God”?

This kid is 7 years old, and clearly
has an entrenched value system. She
was affronted by what she saw as a ter-
rible swear by her classmate. Consider
that, to her, swearing to God is as
offensive as an f—bomb — and that the

kid who so offended her got off scot-
free. Her punishment is outrageous --

-it doesn’t fit the crime.

When most college-age kids were
in second grade, swearing and vio-
lence weren’t so prevalent as they are
in McKenith’s day. She’s exposed to
things on television and in life that we
never were, yet she still has an old-
time value system in place, one that is
affronted by taking the name of God in
vain. ‘

So what’s going on is a kid who is
basically a good apple, withithe possi-
ble ﬂaw of ‘being a little bit preachy,
with a suspension on that dreaded
Permanent Record. If that’s the worst
thing she ever does, she’s in good
shape.

She exists in a climate of fear, a
land where the political-correctness
cops breathe down everyone’s neck.
She’s also been sent the message that
swearing is a great way to get atten-
tion, to rile up the adults around her in

-a big way.

It’s a shame that, with all the terri-
ble things going on in schools today,
one kid standing up_ for her own
wholesome beliefs has to be singled
out and punished.

Could’n’t the effort wasted on
keeping the scourge‘ of the h-word out
of the tender ears of second grader be
redirected to, say, keeping violence
and bullying out of schools?

What’s that smell? It’s an exploding whale carcass

Here’s .a phrase you don’t hear every day:
“Exploding whale has over 5—foot penis.” Even
more unlikely is that you’ve heard it in
a British accent. Perhaps unlikeliest of
all is viewing a video of yet another
whale being packed with dynamite and
then later seeing large chunks 0’ Whale
rain down on horrified town residents,
covering the ﬂeeing humans with blood,
and crushing cars. This is not the plot to
a black-and—white, low—budget science
fiction movie. This is not anew form of
whale—terror. I am not on drugs. .

Picture this scene in Taiwan: you

are a humble shop-keep peddling your

wares on the side of the road, casually I

humming that “Milkshake” song toyourself, when
suddenly you see a massive, 60-ton, 56-foot-long
whale being hauled down the street on the back of
a ﬂatbed truck. You pinch your nose as the smelly

beast passes by and think to yourself, “How could.

this day get any worse?”’Your question is answered
when the whale explodes, covering you from head
to toe with blood and showing what the inside ‘of a
whale’s stomach looks like.‘The incident was said
to be linked to a build—up of intestinal gases.

This was what was being aired on the BBC
News over the weekend while most of us were
being “shocked” at seeing a real, live breast on the
Super Bowl halftime show. If this is thefirst you’re
hearing of the story, don’t worry, it gets stranger.

The explosion has led to coverage of a previous
story involving whales that detonate. According to

 

David J. McCarthy

Columnist

a Taiwan newspaper, the Taipei Times, many resi-
dents had been studying the formerly beached
whale to catch a glimpse of the whale’s
5-foot—plus penis. After days of ﬂash
photography, in what could prove to be
possibly the world’s largest‘ case of
penis envy, the whale was transported
via truck out of public View to a research
facility.

While one may think that whale
explosion and its aftereffects are quite
distinctive, that theory would be incor-
rect. A quick Google search of “explod-

most recent whale explosion, but also to
a previous one caught on tape.

A Dave Barry column describing the events of
the original, and arguably better, exploding whale
story comes up. When a whale washed up on the
beach in Oregon, a debate broke out on how to dis-
pose of the carcass. The final verdict was perhaps
the stupidest idea ever dreamed up: the whale

would be packed with dynamite and blown up. An '

accompanying news video showed residents gath-
ered around the whale, cheering, when the whale
became a ,giant— mushroom cloud of sand and
smoke. A shriek of “Oh God!” pierced the air, and
giant chunks of whale and blood began to rain
down from the sky. The video closes with a shot of

a car crushed under a giant mass of blubber.

While I refuse to take a side in the raging
“which exploding whale is cooler” debate, I will
warn readers of the potentially dangerous conse-

I ing whale” not only provides links to the‘

quences of whale explosion. Web sites defending
both accounts have sprung up, andthe heavy inter-
est has forced the self-proclaimed “definitive site
for exploding whales” to be temporarily shut down
due to heavy traffic. In its absence, an abundance of
Web sites documenting the exploding whale’s five-
foot penis seem to have diverted some of the
exploding whale craze. One site has a discussion
board on whale penises in general.

I would like to take this opportunity to speak
out against whale explosion and whale-related gen-
italia exposure and urge all governments to take
whatever precautions are necessary to prevent all
future disturbing, whale-related incidents. I’m sure
copycat whale exploders are plotting right now.

A If whale explosion becomes a trend, the gener-

— al public may start to prefer exploding whales to

their explosion—impaired counterparts. Whale
explosion is currently the 306th leading killer
among adult males, and also clearly violates the
USA PATRIOT Act.

Take a stand against whale explosion in your
community. Only buy whales that are clearly
labeled “explosion-free” and only support organi-
zations that claim to endorse structurally intact
whale and whale products. Think twice about stuff-
ing your next whale with explosive materials.
Together, we can all make a difference.

David J hopes the presidential candidates take hard
stands on whale explosion and whale penis docu-
mentation. .Explode and expose yourself at

It was the ‘.805, and big hair and neon
clothes were all the rage. My hair was
just a little too big for a second grader,
andmy outﬁts were just a little too ﬂu-

At last, puberty came
and banished the baby fat.
After one unfortunate run-in

Being. a geek is more common here,
because the biggest factors in college
success isn’t necessarily intelligence;
it’s passion.

And being a geek is all about being
passionate: loving “The X—Files” so
much that you can rattle off episode
numbers and names; caring enough
about computers that you take yours
apart to study it; reading Shakespeare

' so many times that you know even the

lines that aren’t necessarily quote-wor-
thy. It’s also about being open—minded,
not fearing things that are a little out of
the ordinary, not considering yourself
too cool to participate in—Magic tourna-
ments or trivia contests.

Which brings me here, to this
moment, when I can say that I don’t
mind if I spend my Saturday nights in
the company of geeks and gaming
books. I don’t.4mind if everyone in the
world knows my dirty little secret (I
saw “The Lord of the Rings” ﬁve times
in the theater, including a midnight
showing). And I don’t care if someone
looks at my “X—Files” DVD collection
and thinks that I’m a geek.

I embrace my inner nerd.

Not everyone knew what they were
getting themselves into on the opening
night of “Rent” at Heinz Hall. Some
people squirmed uncomfortably and
scrunched up their noses as they
watched the story unfold.

First off, this was not their tradi-
tional musical. The loud rock music
coming from the stage made that clear.
Next, they watched in horror as the two
main characters, Mark and Roger,

explained how they lost their girlfriends ‘

Angel pranced on stage in a dangerous-
ly short skirt and almost sent them into
shock. Surprisingly, they made it
through the entire show without faint-
mg.

True, “Rent” is not for everyone.
Jonathan Larson held nothing back in
hisscript full of sex, drugs and rock ‘n’
roll. But it must be doing something
right to continue selling out after eight
years on Broadway. That “something”

is the edginess that “Rent” brings to the

traditional idea of what a musical is.
The show tackles tough themes like

drugs, AIDS and death, but the tone

remains upbeat for almost the entire

two and a half hours. Certain songs are.

full of so much energy that you find
yourself dancing discreetly in your seat.

During “Tango Maureen,” Mark and his .

ex-girlfriend’s new lover, Joarme, strut
back and forth ‘on stage while exchang-
ing tips and jabs on the absent Maureen.
In “La Vie Boheme,” the cast references
Pee Wee Herman and the Sex Pistols.
Does it get any better than that?

“Rent” prides itself on not having

“stars” in the show, and instead show-
cases up-and-coming young talent. The
current roster of talent ranges from
obscenely gifted to mediocre. When the
cast sings as one, they sound phenome-

Football loses top recruits to Penn State, Miami

BRIAN GOLDMAN
Staff Writer

Wednesday was supposed to be
the day Penn Hills senior quarter-
back Anthony Morelli signed on the
dotted line to become a Pitt Panther.
Wednesday was supposed to be the
day Pitt head coach , Walt Harris
introduced a top 25 recruiting class.

“My take on signing day is, you
never know what’s going to hap-

pen,” Harris said. “It’s not an exact

science.”

Instead, midday Wednesday,
Morelli signed with Pitt’s rival,
Penn State. ‘Morelli signed with the
Nittany Lions because he believes
Penn State head coach Joe Paterno
will be with his team longer then
Harris will be with Pitt, he said.
Morelli, ranked as one of the top
five high school quarterbacks in the
country, had verbally committed to
Pitt over a month ago. .

The Panthers announced yester-
day that they had signed 22 players
to play for Pitt next season.
However, Morelli wasn’t the only
high school senior that had commit-.
ted_to Pitt whose name wasn’t on
this list. a

North Hills High School run-
ning back Andrew Johnson had ver-

bally committed to Pitt, but signed-

with Miami yesterday. Also, line-
backer JamesvBryant of Reading
High School — brother of Pitt’s
Sam Bryant —\had verbally com-
mitted to Pitt, but also signed with
Miami yesterday.

“We were excited about those
young men, but if they feel like,
someplace else, they’ll get coached
better or like the university better,
then we wish’ them well and we
hope they can accomplish their
dreams, and we are going to move
on,” Harris said. “I really believe
the word ‘commitment’ should be
redefined in the teenage vocabulary
because it’s different from what we
commit, and we don’t quite do the
same thing.”

‘Players are allowed to verbally

‘commit to schools at any time.
‘ However, until that name is signed

on signing day, the high school
player is fair game.

“The thing that disappoints me
most about recruiting is the negativ-
ity,” Harris said. “A couple of the
kids that committed to us have been
totally abused by other schools. I
think that part of college football
needs to be upgraded. I’m not talk-



 

ing about phone calls, I’m talking
about negative rumors.”
According to Harris, he is happy

-with his 22-player recruiting class,

which includes players from eight
states at 10 different positions.

“We’re excited about the young
men that decided to be with us,”
Harris said. “All you have to do is
be on the phone at- seven in the
morning and hear the excitement in
their voices.”

With Morelli signing with Penn
State, Pitt signed Darrell Strong
from Plantation High School in
Southern Florida. Strong played

both widereceiver and quarterback
in his years at Plantation High, and
was originally recruited by Pitt ‘as a
tight end, until Morelli left, leaving
a vacancy at the quarterback posi-
tion. -

After a dismal season on the
defensive side of the ball, Pitt
signed eight defensive players —
four defensive lineman and four
defensive backs. Two defensive
linemen, Phil Tilman and Corey
Davis, are listed at more than 300
pounds. _

“We were able to recruit some
bigger guys that we had been hav-

ing trouble recruiting in the past,”
Harris said. “We also made some
stronger inroads in south Florida.”

On offense, Pitt signed three
offensive linemen and three wide
receivers. With Antonio Bryant and
Larry Fitzgerald each winning the
Biletnikoff Award’ as the nation’s
top receiver, Pitt had no trouble-‘
convincing two prominent wide
receivers — Marcel Pestano and
Kelvin Chandler — from Southern
Florida to sign with Pitt.

Rounding out the class of 22
were one running back, a fullback
and a tight end.
