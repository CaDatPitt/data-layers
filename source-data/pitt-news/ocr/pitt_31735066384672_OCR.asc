House Passes Increase for Pitt; Tuition Picture Cloudy

By RICH HARRY

Pitt News Staff Writer

The state’s budget machinery has been set in motion with House
passage of a $5.8 billion spending plan that includes a roughly four

percent increase for Pitt, or three percent below the rate Chancellor.

Posvar says will enable the University to stave off another tuition
hike.

News Analysis

Currently before the Senate, the budget package earmarks $63

million for Pitt as part of an overall $14 million appropriations in- '

crease for all state-related an_d state—owned institutions of higher
education. Governor Shapp in February recommended no increase
for higher learning, thereby shunning Pitt’s request of $70.9
million and holding it at last year’s amount of $60.4 million.
Whether this means another tuition hike for Pitt students

. remains unclear, however, as the administration’s decision hinges
001] the final amount passed by the Legislature, barring a Shapp

veto.

The Office of Planning and Budget is currently reviewing man-
datedincrease requests by the Universityfs 16 schools as a prelude
to hammering out a budget to be presented to University Trustees
in May. Thereis no indication as to what tuition figure will be in-
cluaed. _ . V

But when considering both the four percent hike by the House
and the Chancellor’s statements at last month’s budget hearings-

Looking for a quiet place to study for finals, this student has apparently
found a place in Hillman Library.

that the University can get by with a seven-percent boost——chances
appear at first glance to be slim that students won’t be tagged for
more money to pay education costs.

“We wouldn’t want to rule out the possibility of a slight (tuition)
increase in the fall,” said Bernard Kobosky, vice chancellor for
public affairs, adding that Pitt must wait for the final figures from
Harrisburg before making any concrete decisions in the Cathedral.

Officials here also expressed satisfaction at the relative speed
with which House members cleared and delivered the package.
This year, tax—increase disputes that marked sessions a year ago and

forced an exceedingly late passage in December were nonexistant in e

the House and are not anticipated in the Senate.

Therefore, it’s a Shapp veto, similar to one he exercised last
December, that is considered to be a roadblock to Pitt’s funding.

“Shapp cut us back last year, and it’s possible he may do it
again,” said Dennis McManus, assistant director of Pitt’s govern-
mental relations office.

Central to a possible veto could be the budget’s substantial cuts
in what the Shapp administration views as mandated spending; for
instance, a $12 million reduction in the state employee’s retirement
program and a $3 million slice for school transportation costs.

There were also administration pronouncements——and legisla-‘
ture denials~—that the House’s proposal, if enacted, would put the
state in the red in addition to forcing a tax increase.

Despite all the uncertainties, it’s still a good bet the bottom line
of next year’s invoice will show a figure slightly higher than the last
one.

Students Against Plus/Minus, Poll Shows

By TOM M. KUKUCKA

Pitt News Staff Writer

believed the new system has made
grading less equitable and 35.8

A Student Government Board
survey has shown that a majority of
Pitt’s students are opposed to the
plus/ minus grading system institu-
ted last fall.

The survey, conducted by SGB
member Jan Medoff, ‘with assist-
ance from board members Diane
Behers and Sharon Starzynski,
indicated that 59.8 percent of all
students polled expressed disap-
proval of the new system, while 34.4
percent approved of the change.

Some 400 students were polled in
the Cathedral, Student Union and
Towers lobby.

Medoff said he had expected a
higher percentage of students to
express dissatisfaction.

“I thought a lot more people
would be against it, around 60 or 70
percent,” Medoff said.

Of those polled, 56.3 percent

percent believed the system made
grading more equitable.

“The general feeling is that it
isn’t used equally across the board
by all teachers,” Medoff said.

In the fall of 1976, 26.4 percent of
the students at Pitt received “A”
grades. Last fall, that number had
been reduced to 17.2 percent.

Medoff said the new system was
developed by University officials to
counter growing grade inﬂation.
He added that this has not helped
Pitt students in competition for jobs
and graduate school positions with
students from other universities.

“Pitt students will be competing
with students from other schools
who haven’t been exposed to
plus/ minus grading,” Medoff said.

Medical Action Committee Shelved 3)’ SGB

By TOM M. KUKUCKA
Pitt News Staff Writer

The Student Government Board voted
 dnesday to dissolve the Medical Action
Cirrnittee and assume control of the peer

medical aide program (PMAP).

SGB member Dave Hesidence said there
was a “duplication of services” with the
upgrading of the student health service.

, Hesidence added that money from the student
activities fee was being used to fund two
organizations providing similar

“The committee did fall apart,” Hesidence
said. “The chairmanship had rotated 3 or 4

, times (in the past year) and they couldn't get
 ’ ized again.”

JI-Iesidence said membership in th€_'

oo.l'un7ittee'had recently fallen to 15-20 people.

In.,taking control of PMAP. the board‘

Hesidence also cited organizational problems 7
‘ as a reason for the committee disbanding.

service would assume control of PMAP in the
near future.

“We would like to see student health
services as centralized as possible,”
Hesidence said.

In other actions, the board selected
committee members to the Committee on
Student Organizations. Ted Nelson was
approved as chairman with Carolyn Cermin-
aro, James Ruehmling, James Vidt and Bruce
Waldholtz as committee members. Paul Aaron
and Terry Eggert were named alternates.

On the subject of the current WPIC strike,
SGB president Josh Baylson said no statement
could be released with regard to the strike
because both sides are currently in collective
bargaining. A representative from the striking
union at the hospital had approached the board
several weeks ago requesting an SGB
statement in favor of the striking union.

In other business, Baylson and board
member Jan Medoﬁ reported that the budget
for the Pitt Union Programming Council was

- now--being-reviewed-and "guidelines for

subcommittees were to be studied. Medoff

indicated that summer programs were being

considered as a “trial run” for the Council.

Board member Stan Galanski stated that the
last meeting of the Pennsylvania Student _
Association of State Related Universities
(PSASRU) at Lincoln had produced changes in
the constitution of the state wide student lobby
group. The major change involved the
selection of board members from each school.
Four members will now be chosen from each
school instead of the original three, and one
representative must be either female or
member of a minority group.

Galanski, Hesidence and Todd Parke,-
chairman of the Governmental and Public
Relations Committee had been chosen earlier
to represent Pitt.

A statement was to be released to PSASRU
representatives expressing the SGB’s dissatis-
faction with the oonstitutional changes.»

“We will have to devise a new system of
selecting board members,” Galanski said. ~ ~ i-

inflation makes it more difficult for a
Pitt student to get a job or to get into
grad school. ’ ’

Medoff said an interesting
highlight of the poll was the
comparison of opinions expressed
by freshmen versus seniors. Of the
freshmen polled, 59.4 percent were
against plus/ minus. Of the
sophomores surveyed, 67.2 percent
were against the grading system,
while 65.6 percent juniors and 68.2
percent seniors were opposed to the
system.

“The longer they (students) were
at the University, the,m01'€ t_heY
were against it," Medoff Sadd-
“The experienced students are
dissatisﬁed with it.

“We as students—people paying
the bills—have a right to determine
how we are evaluated,” Medoff
said. “Most people here are very
grade conscious, and I think we
should go back to the old system.”

“72 Yearsof Collegiate Journalism at the University of Pmsburgh"

Lobbying Efforts  

Somebody must be listening in ‘Harrisburg. After the demon-
strations by Pitt students and the lobbying efforts by Pitt ad-
ministrators, the State House responded with a $63 million
allocation to Pitt, $3 million more than Governor Shapp suggested.

V-«M

 

With a large percentage of state revenues mandated for various
budget items, the extra funds come as a welcome surprise. They
represent quite a shift in attitude from last year, when Shapp cut
the state contribution to the University.

It’s hard to say how much effect the lobbying efforts by the
Chancellor and the Student Government Board had on the House’s
decision, but it is doubtful the University would have been given
any increase if lobbyists-had notworked so hard for it. With the
tight budget situation that prevails in Harrisburg, the legislators
could easily have four-d some other item worth funding if Pitt had
not played the role of legislator’s conscience.

The increase might represent a slight victory for Pitt, but a state
legislature wholly committed to adequate funding of higher
education still does not exist. The House was generous enough to
give Pitt $3 million, but it did not feel the University deserved the
full $70 million requested by Chancellor Posvar.

To insure a legislature committed to higher education requires a
lot of work by students and administrators. The administration
should do more than appear at budget committee hearings and
present the same tired scare statements about the working class
being priced out of the higher education market.

Students should be more involved in the governmental process,
and they must usemore effective methods of political pressure than
demonstrating. It’s trite but true to say the vote has great promise
as a political tool for students, though it is little used.

The first step toward creating a higher education-sensitive legis-
lature should be to push the State Senate and Governor to accept
the House’s $3 million allocation increase for Pitt. Without this in-
crease Pitt faees even higher tuition hikes and more years of poor
relations with an unsympathetic legislature.

No Recognition of Smaller Sports at Pitt

Being an avid reader of the Pitt
News, I am especially anxious to see
if staff writer Cris Hoel has
contributed another expertly writ-
ten commentary in the latest

‘edition. But last March 22, when I

quickly turned to the sports section,
I read the heading ‘ ‘A Little Look at
Spring Sports-Football and Basket-
ball,” which annoyed me to say the
least. Football and basketball are as
much spring sports as ice fishing
and tobaggonning.

I am a member of one of the true
spring sports, which include
baseball, tennis, and track, and
when these two larger “spring”
sports get priorities when it is our
turn, I cry in anger. Please Cris,
give us a fighting chance! We are
not asking for packed stands,

cheerleaders, or a marching band,

just some well deserved space in the

News when our seasons roll around.
Sometimes I feel if Mr. Hoel could
compose one of his fine columns for
any of us smaller sports, we might

receive a little more attention from
the public at our games, matches,
and meets, than we get now.

Letter to Hockey Team

To the Pitt Hockey Club:

Your dedication, pride and guts
has given» you, for the seventh
straight year, a winning season with
14-9-1 record.

Upgrading competition against

JV’s and strong independant
varsity -teams with little or no
pregame practice proved you can
play the game with the best of them

More than once playing either sick

something special.
Thank you for the season...

Pittsburgh. Anyone who has not
shattered his gloom by shattering a
household object after his team lost

PER S UA SIONS

“Fire and destruction
will rise up and consume
all who dare to face the
Maker on their Final
Day without knowing
who made the ﬁnal out
of Don Larsen ’s perfect
World Series game in
1956. ”

will never be able to truly bask in the
glorious rays of victory.

And yet there are still some
among us who remain pagans’. They
refuse to travel to the promised land
of astroturf and pinetar, refuse to
dip their toes in the holy baptisimal
waters of syrupy coke and warm
beer, refuse to be born again.

These unfortunate people must
be strong to remain aloof from all
the happenings around them. But
they too will soon realize that their
days are short, and God frowns
upon those who haven’t paid
homage to his shrine on earth. Fire
and destruction will rise up and
consume all who dare to face the
Maker on the Final Day without
knowing who made the ﬁnal out of
Don Larsen’s perfect World Series
game in 1956.

But you must watch a game in 3

person and absorb the atmosphere
of a ballpark on game day to
appreciate what I am saying. There
is a certain way to attend a game,
and, in the interest of making this
world a better place to live, I
announce the following rules:

Rule One: Always arrive at the
ball park at least one hour before
game time. Baseball does not begin
and end with the first and last outs.
Baseball is a-mood, a feeling, an
aura that is carried by people and
must be transmitted to -others that
are not so fortunate.

By arriving at the ballpark early,
you allow that aura to circulate
about the stadium in search of
virgin souls. Also, if you move close
to the field you can get yourself
some foul balls and autographs.

Rule Two: Once the game has
started, do whatever is necessary to
get a foul ball or home run for a
souvenir. Elderly people, small
children and nuns should be treated
with respect outside the stadium,
but, if they stand between you and a
baseball, it’s open season. Some
people have been killed in pursuit of
baseballs. Greater love has no man.

Rule Three: Be ritualistic. Some
people buy a beer after every hit.
Some people cross and recross their
legs after every pitch. Some people
have been known to offer human
sacrifices. The fan must do
something. to be part of the
spectacle. Your ritual will bring the

~.-

team luck and you will contribute-3?  ..
directly to the team’s success. Also, ’“ 

the sight of 45,000 people crossing

their legs at the same time is a real .

mindblower.

Rule Four: Do not go home
immediately after the game. Linger
inthe stadium and try to inhale the

» great fragrance of victory or wash ‘

away the ugly stain of defeat.
You may not come back to the
stadium for some time so take a
moment after most others leave and
look around the marvelous
temples, the monument to a great

civilization. You may want to look 

on the ground of the marvelous
temple where you may find some
lost wallets.

Baseball seaon has just begun l

and six more glorious months
follow. This next half-year is what
makes the other half-year livable.

‘ Diverse Methods ofiStrike Breaking at Pitt L

By JOHN HESS

The University of Pittsburgh is
the largest employer in Pittsburgh.
The scope of its employees ranges
from clerical to cleaning staff,
computer programmers to prep
cooks, laborers to lab technicians
and police to professors. Of this vast
number of workers, only a small
percentage is unionized. Unions or
”ollective action is the only form of
bargaining power that workers
have. So for the majority of workers
at Pitt there is no means to ﬁght for
more equitable pay scales, better
pension plans or improved working
conditions.

Pitt, like all employers, is
anti-union. The more they can bleed
their workers, the happier they are.
Employers do not take kindly to the
thought of unions that clot this flow
of plasma; in fact the only clots they
condone are those that block the
flow of workers’ progress—scabs.
Every organizing effort at Pitt has
its classic stories of anonymous
threats to workers involved in or

ympathetic to the union.

Rummaging through workers’
desks, lockers and even waste
baskets is a tactic that has been
used to create paranoia among
workers involved in attempts to
organize workers.

Workers are not as dumb or as
cowardly as the University would
like, so other union-breaking
measures have been drummed up.
One such plan is removing the more
popular, more militant union from
the ballot at the last minute, so that
workers are left a chioce between a
weak union that will do little to help
its mernbers, or no representation.

la the 1873 21321231 warren
election, AFSME, the union
preferred by the workers to the

weaker PSEA, was mysteriously
removed from the ballot days before
the election. AFSME organizers
refused to answer questions from
workers who had been its support-
ers, leaving us only to surmise that
Pitt had succeeded in either scaring
them or buying them.

(The election resulted in “no
representation,” as the clerical
workers made the statement that no
union is better than a sell-out union.

The clerical workers have begun
their organizing efforts once again,
and hopefully, having learned from
their past mistakes, will obtain
reliable representation.

The police at Pitt experienced a
similar rip-off during their last
union elections. This time, the
AFSME union—International
Brotherhood of Police-—that was
supported by the majority of the
police was pulled off the ballot by
Pitt on a technicality, again very
shortly before the election.

Even when the representation the
workers want is voted in through an
election, Pitt has developed further
ploys to eradicate the union. When
1199P won its charter election at
Western Psych in 1973, the hospital
appealed the results three times to
the National Labor Relations Board.
Each time, the union election was
upheld. Western Psych then took its
case to the State Commonwealth
Court and won on a technicality-
someone had been wearing a 1199
button on the day of the election.

The only weapon unions (once

' recognized) have to wrest demands

from their employer is to strike. In
the past, Pitt has met strikes with a
variety of calculated schemes in
order to try to break the strike and

lﬁﬁfiilly (rat Pitt) the union.

Currently the striking workers of
Western Psychiatric Institute and

Clinic’s (WPIC) union 1199P are
receiving the full treatment.

When union truck drivers refused
to cross the picket lines, Pitt hired
scab drivers using rented U-Haul
trucks. Campus police were utilized
to escort the scab workers across the
picket_line. This is a common duty of
police in our country and Pitt is no
exception. Other workers at WPIC
not represented by 1199P who have
honored the picket line have been
“suspended indeﬁnitely.” Non-
striking workers have been assign-
ed the duties of strikers.

Replacing psychiatric aides by
people without the training or
experience in handling emotionally
disturbed patients has resulted in
catastrophy. There have been
reports of violence and injury to
both staff and patients. It has been
rumored that even‘ secretaries are
being coerced (through job security)
to work in in-patient units. In the
five weeks since the strike began,
Pitt has not made one sincere move

in the direction of contract
negotiations.

The union has indicated to the
state mediator that it is willing to
open talks at any time. Pitt is
operating under the assumption
that if they can keep the hospital
open and not succumb to any
demands, they will succeed in
sending the strike-weary workers
back to the job empty-handed.
However, the strikers are not so
easily discouraged and while the
hospital is “open,” it is in a state of
deterioration.

As the time for Medicaid
inspection approaches, the admin~
istration begins to feel the pressure
of the workers’ struggle. As this
pressure grows, they will be forced
to view the demands seriously and
thus, ideally, concede to all of them.

But if all their demands are met
miners with their strategic position
(which is unlikely), the control the
workers will gain over their
workplace will be minimal. Even the

;SP¢rAL
;0RKEP5
jean A

 

in the economy, their strength in
numbers and their strike endurance
not only didn’t receive many
important demands (health benefit
deductibles, fair pensions, etc.) but
even if they had, the company still
holds ultimate control.

The power of the workers united
is great. We all must support the
right of workers to strike to gain
improvements in their working
conditions, pay and pensions-—all
things which can be gained from
strikes.

Some things cannot be gained
from strikes. Strikes cannot change
the basic inequity of the economic
system in which we live. Until this
system undergoes a fundamental
transformation, workers will not
have control of their workplaces and
lives.

John Hess is a member of the Anti-
imperialist Student Union.

Bonnieftaitt sang up a storm at the Syria Mosque Wednesday night.

A Bonnie Performs First Roiff

By KEITH BRIAN
Pitt News Staff Writer

The dominating nose of Leon
Redbone poked out from the
shadows made by the straw hat
encircing his head. Equipped with
only an acoustic guitar and a voice
circa 1930, Redbone sang the blues
on Wednesday night as a warm-up
for the Syria Mosque show of
Bonnie Raitt.

Redbone wasn’t in the form he
was last summer, but his antics and
oddities serve enough to validate
his presence and also to whet the
appetite for the primary performer
Bonnie Raitt.

With her hair blowing in the
onstage breeze, the enthused
musician picked up her electrical
acoustic guitar and started into
Jackson Browne’s “Under The
Falling Sky.”

A four-man band accompanied
thelady into “Good Enough for

Me.” She talked freely with the
crowd as they yelled requests,
saying “You know all the hits,
don't you?” Someone in front gave
her a picture, drawing cheers and
more remarks from an audience
that hadn’t the opportunity to see
her in four years.

Raitt told the people they should
soften up some for the next few
numbers. They did. She was
singing the blues, “Everybody’s
Crying Mercy,” and Bill Elliot on
piano was playing them. Another
Jackson Brown tune “Opening
Farewell” filled the blues with
Raitt changing to her solid electric
guitar.

Raitt placed a metallic tube over
the ring ﬁnger of her left hand
before introducing the next
number. The kinky-haired “Free-
bo" put his fretless bass down to
approach the tuba. The song
“Kokomo Blues” revealed the

nimbleness of Raitt’s ﬁngers,
showing that she is indeed an
accomplished guitarist. Freebo on
tuba in this and the following
number added depth.

Raitt again replied to calls from
the crowd before declaring, “No
mercy for you Pittsburgh, ,you’re
going to get it!” What they got was
“Give It Up, Or Let Me Go,”
featuring Elliot on keyboard again
and Freebo with his gleaming tuba.

Raitt gave great kudos to
McFarland who did do some fancy
fingerwork, but the majority of the
laurels belong on Raitt’s Brow.
She is a slick performer with many
talents.

The sound was clear and her
voice strong despite an apparent
hoarseness during conversation, a
condition she credited to “partying
with Little Feat in D.C.”

The climax of the performance
was reached as “Three Time

50‘.

Religious Survey revealed some startling
facts: 

Of the 500 students personally interviewed
we discovered:

a) 80% of these students had no solutions to
the basic problems of humanity.

b) 65% of these students had either no
philosophy of life or a vague one.

o) 72% of these students were not sure that
they would ever see the inside of heaven.

d) 14% of these students understood that to
become a christian you must believe in Jesus
Christ as your personal savior.

e) 81% of these students were interested in I I

  knowing how a relationship with God could be
important to them personally.

Duquesne, the small school down the road attemp-
ting to resurrect its once-proud basketball program
by recruiting ahandful of big men, and Pitt, the
Cathedral-capped school trying to keep its program
headed upward. by attracting a group‘ or. decent

‘ Gissendanner, rated by a reputable local high school
basketball follower as the fourth—best player in the"
area (behind Doug Arnold, Jamie Hall and Bruce

announce that 6-3 Scott Grevey intends to play at
Pitt.

Grevey, who averaged 24.5 points per game for
Hamilton Taft in Ohio’s Greater Miami Conference
this past season, puts Pitt “at the top of the list,”
but is still considering Yale and Vermont. The Pitts-
burgh Press has reported several times that Grevey

~ will attend Pitt or Louisville, but Grevey, during ‘a

phone intefview, never mentioned the Cardinals. A

J Louisville assistant coach, Jerry Jones, yesterday
I said bylphone from Louisville that his school showed
‘interest in Grevey early this year but gave up on him

because “he’s not what we need.”

GFCVCY. however, may be precisely what Grgurich
could use; Grevey’s high school coach, who also
coached Kevin Grevey of the Washington Bullets,
said Scott does not possess “extraordinary” natural
talent but that he was an extremely valuable player.
Grevey is levelheaded for an 18-year-old and would
be an excellent addition to Pitt’s program.

   

. Ar.t'B'ortn'ick hits higamu-wmninig homer.

By KAREN KADILAK .
PittNews Staff Writer

Although it took late-inning
comebacks in both games to do it,
Pitt’s baseball team swept a
doubleheader from Robert Morris
Wednesday at blustery Trees
Field.

Winning, 9-7 and 8-3, the
Panthers used a four-run seventh
in the opener‘ and a six-run ﬁfth in
the nightcap to pull out its double
victory. ' . .

Pitt, now 5-2 on the season, will
play another doubleheader at
Carnegie-Mellon this afternoon.

Down,‘ 7-5, going into the last of
the seventh and final inning, the
Panthers’ Art Bortnik smashed a
three-run home to win the ﬁrst
game. Pitt’s offensive football
tackle-turned first baseman took
advantage_of the wind and drilled
‘the ball overithe '-398-feet mark in
centerﬁeld. ,

Dave DiCello, whose clutch two-
out home run set up the winning run
in Pitt’s doubleheader split with
Kent State Saturday, preceded
Bortnik’s game-winning shot with a
two-out double._

Displaying the same sort of
' two-out thunder in the second

game, the Panthers picked up six
runs in the ﬁfth inning to complete
the sweep. The rally~was keyed by

His decision on a school, however, should not‘Vi
come before the end of next week.

Jimmy Pastin’s two-run homer and
hits by second baseman Duane
Sakanich and leadoff hitter Mark
Stevens. ‘

Pitt was down, 3-2, going into its_

big inning. * ‘

“I didn’t like it when “we were
3-2,” Pitt coach Bobby Lewis said
during the sixth inning. “1t’s more
fun when it’s’ the other way
around.” ‘ I ,_ ,.

Relief pitching came to. the
Panthers’ rescue, however; re-
lievers Mark Bianco ‘and ,Tim

Moran picked up the victories. The’

two replaced starters Tony DiSaia
and Dave Crist, -bothof whom had
trouble going the distancelin their
first starts of the season. '
Bianco, picking up his second
straight win in relief, pitched the
Panthers out of a jam in the ﬁfth
inning. of the first game. With
runners on second and third and the
Colonials ahead, 6-5, the junior
from Carrick High School pro-
ceeded to strike out the first Robert
Morris "batter he faced before
forcing the next to ground out to
slioitstop Kurt Leitholf. Of Robert

. Morris's four runs in the inning,

three were unearned, courtesy of
three Pitt errors.

Moran had similar success in the
second game. Entering the game in
the top of the ﬁfth, the freshman

 

said yesterday.

about Atkins.

The Dukes are still courting Norwin’s Doug Ar-
nold and Wilkinsburg’s Bruce Atkins, the local big‘; 
men who also a.re the object of pitches from out-‘of-J if A A
state schools. Arnold, though, will likely sign with
the Dukes early next week. '

“Arnold’s playing in a tournament this weekend
and we’ll probably get him toesign after he’s through
with that,” an extremely reliable Duquesne source
“I’ve got a good feeling about Ar-
nold——I think we’ll get him——but I’m not as sure

“There’s still a shot, though,” he continued.

from Peabody High‘ held the
Colonials to a harmless single in
the three innings he pitched.
“Our starting pitching wasn’t as
strong as we had anticipated,”
Lewis said. “You really can’t
blamethe kids for that. I’ve seen a
great one like Tom Seaver have a
bad day now and then. We were
just fortunate to get that good relief
pitching.” _ '  ._ “ 5 " "
PITTCHES: With‘ the wind
blowing out, both teams hit a
combined total of seven home
runs...Besides Bortnik’s and Pas-
tin_’s key homers, Kurt Leitholf and
Mark Stevens also homered for the
Panthers. . .Pitt’s ‘error-prone ide-
fense, in the first game didn’t help
starter Tony DiSaia any. 5 Pitt
committed six errors in the game,
three coming in Robert Morris’s big
four-run ﬁfth inning. . .Catchers Jim

w

Pastin and Dave DiCello eachvhad 1

three hits...

The Panthers travel to " West
Virginia tomorrow for yet another
twin bill before returning to Trees
Field for a single game against
Howard University Sunday. DiSaia
and Crist are expected to "pitch
again then. “Since it’s a
nine-inning game ,/I think I may split
the work load between the two,”
Lewis said.

 

A decision from Bill Clarke, the 6-8 strongman
who played with Sam Clancy at Fifth Avenue three
years ago and has spent the past two years in summer
leagues and at Allegheny Community College, came
yesterday. ‘ ’

Clarke, believed by informed Pitt followers to be

-leaning toward Grgurich as late as Wednesday

evening, became Duquesne’s initia_l_jsignee yesterday
afternoon. - 1 T

Clarke, whose attitude repelled most recruiters two
seasons ago, was greeted with glowing phrases by big
man-starved Mike Rice, Duquesne’s new coach.

“The thing that impressed me most, other than his
talent, is that now he’s a determined young man
looking toward the future instead of the past,” Rice-
said.

Asked whether Clarke would start for the Dukes
next season, a Duquesne spokesman said, “I would
think so. We have a couple of openings for big guys.
and he’s certainly a good big man.”

 

 

“Atkins would start and Arnold would either start or
play a heck of a lot with us.”

The Dukes expect to dispense five scholarships this 

yeari Pitt, though most of its players return, is, able
to sign seven newcomers. Already_ awarded are
scholarships to Gissendanner, 6-8 Ed Wallace of
Piladelphia‘ Bartrum_ and 6-4 transfer Carleton
Neverson. Grevey will likely receive a fourth and
Duane Wallace, 6-2 of Baltimore Dunbar, may be the
fifth Panther recruit.

Grgurich was in Pittsburgh yesterday and left for
Ohio last night. The only Ohioan with a discernable
link to Pitt is Grevey. The Panthers also hold
some—-but, unlesss they enjoy letdowns, not
much—hope of attracting forward Walker Russell
(United States MVP at the Roundball Classic) and
guard Kevin Broadnax of Philadelphia. Broadnax

played with the Pennsylvania team at the Dapper
Dan all-star game._
