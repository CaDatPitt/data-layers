The , Libertarian‘ Party

might be the third—largest

States, but a month before
the presidential election,
the Pitt College Libertarians
have yet to meet.

The group, which” dis- _

to reactivate itself by hold-

getting the word out that it’s

Group membership is 

low compared to past years,

president of the Pitt Col-

the group can offer a lot to
Pitt students, he said.
“Libertarianism is a very

people consider themselves

said Gillie. V‘ ”

According to David Powell, the
chairman of the Libertarian Party
of Pittsburgh and adviser to the
Pitt College Libertarians, the cam-
pus club has been inactive because
of the members’ busy schedules
and the inconvenience of the aca-
demic calendar. I

“It’s unfortunate that the po-
litical calendar and the academic
calendar tend to conﬂict,” said
Powell. '

likely on Tuesday evenings, and
added, ‘Tm hoping that once we .

Powell said, some people are
willing to come in, speak and give
presentations for the College Lib-
ertarians. It’s just a matter of re-
serving-rooms for the meetings.

In addition to the‘Pitt group,
Libertarians can join the Libertar-
ian Party of Pittsburgh.

The city’s chapter of the Liber-

\ tarian Party holds monthly meet-V

ings and other events.

“Our local group is currently
helping out candidates, ‘pursuing
issue campaigns, and we also have
a lot of fun,” said Powell. V

Pitt students, he added, can
also volunteer for the Libertarian
candidates’ campaigns.

solutely not affected.”

Geiger added that state—related scholar-
ships from outside of Pennsylvania can be in
danger, though this is extremely unlikely.

Suzanne McColloch, senior associate di-
rector of ﬁnancial aid at Pitt, said that she
thinks it’s unlikely that voting is tied to state
ﬁnancial aid.

“Since no one is required to register to
vote, it seems like a very unlikely requirement
or prohibition on a state ﬁnancial aid pro-
gram,” said McColloch.

“I am not 100 percent certain, but I am
not aware of any state program administered
by our ofﬁce that requires recipients of grants
or scholarships from a speciﬁc state to be reg-
istered to vote in that speciﬁc state,” said Mc~
Colloch.

Geiger said the requirements to vote are
that the individual be 18 years of age or older,
a resident of the state for thirty days and a
citizen of the United States.

The Department of State’s document, the
“Basic Guide to Student Voting in Pennsyl-
vania,” said that after meeting these criteria,
an individual can register at a voter registra-
tion ofﬁce, by mail or by visiting PennDot or
a number of other state ofﬁces.

Additionally, the Student Vote Coalition
placed tables throughout campus so students
can register to vote.

Students will receive a voter registration
card in the mail, though Geiger said they
might not receive the card before Election
Day. This won’t hinder their ability to vote,
she said.

On Election Day, voters must bring their
registration cards, unless they didn’t receive
them, and a photo ID if they’re voting at a
location for the ﬁrst time.

“The student ID is most convenient,” said
Geiger.

Voter registration ofﬁces must receive ap-

plications by Monday, Oct. 6, to be eligible for

the upcoming general election.

Voters can conﬁrm their registration sta-
tus by calling 1—877—VOTESPA.

Mark W/olosik, who is manager of the Al-

legheny Elections Division, encourages stu— ‘

dents to use an absentee ballot.

“Everyone is too busy on Election Day to
vote, anyway,” said ‘Wolosik.

Absentee ballots allow individuals who are
otherwise unable to vote to vote at the loca-
tion where they are registered.

Downloadable absentees ballots are avail-
able online. Voters submit them to the county
election office where they are registered, ac-
cording to Votespa.com, the Department of
State’s voter information Web site.

Pat Graham, president of the College Re-
publicans, is registered at his home, though
home, he said, is only twenty minutes away.

“Sometimes people have local issues that
the}/re concerned about,” said Graham.

Graham recommends using the absentee
ballot in these instances. Other times, he en-
courages students to register here.

College students in Colorado, South Caro-
lina and Virginia had difﬁculty registering to
vote on campus, said Sujatha jahagirdar, the

Political Point-CounterPoint: Judging the Supreme Court

Progreadivcjudged are bedtfor today ‘.4 Americana

by Shane Levy
Colummln‘

The 2008 presidential election is one of the
most signiﬁcant in American history. Recent-

ly, much of the attention of both Sen. Barack ‘

Obama’s and Sen. john McCain’s campaigns
has turned to the failing economy. However,
perhaps one of the most signiﬁcant decisions
that the next US. president will have to make
is the appointment of federal judges.

Justice John Paul Stevens will be 88 years
old in April, and by January 2009 ﬁve other
Supreme Court justices will be between 69

and 75 years of age. Regardless of who wins I

on Nov. 4, the next president will be responsi-
ble for shaping the ideological make-up of the
highest court in the United States. With such
signiﬁcant implications on American society,
it is vital that the president nominate a judge
who is capable of adapting the Constitution
to modern society and the circumstances of
the present time

 already stated that he would
use both Chief justice john Roberts and Jus-
tice Samuel Alito, both of whom have strong
conservative leanings, as the “model for my
own nominees, if that responsibility falls to
me,” according to his Web site.

With the potential for conservative re-
placements for the liberal justices who could
retire during the next president’s adminis-
tration, it is quite possible that the Supreme
Court could take a conservative leaning by ef-

 

what he would look for in a Supreme Court
Justice, Obama held up a picture of former
chief justice Earl Warren. Warren led the Su-
preme Court in creating the landmark 1954
ruling that outiawed school segregation. It
is Obama’s combination of legal experience
and knowledge that make him the most quali-
ﬁed candidate to be able to appoint a judge to
the Supreme Court.

In July 2007, Obama said, “We need
somebody who’s got the heart, the empathy,
to recognize what it’s like to be a young teen-
age mom. The empathy to understand what
it’s like to be poor, or African-American, or
gay, or disabled, or old.” Although Obama is
justified in arguing that any Supreme Court
justice —— whose job it is to interpret the Con-
stitution and to protect the liberties that the
document granted to the American people
—— be an empathetic person, capable of un-
derstanding the circumstances of less fortu-
nate Americans, I believe that what Obama
might have been  is that it is crucial
that the appointed judge be capable of adapt-
ing the principles of the Constitution to the
issues facing Americans, not 250 years ago,
but in 2008 and beyond.

The framers of our Constitution, who were
unquestionably brilliant men, together crafted
one of the most exceptional pieces of litera-
ture in history, not to mention the framework
for American democracy. However, their dis-
positions and beliefs were those of 18th cen-
tury Americans. In the 21 st century, events

Obama is a lawyer, and before his time in the
Illinois State Senate, he taught constitutional
law at the University of Chicago Law School.
In a New York Times interview, one of his
former colleagues, Cass R. Sunstein, said that
Obama “knows this stuff [law and legal is-
sues] inside and out, and he has the credentials
to be easily appointed to the Court himself.”

The presidential power of appointing justices
to the Supreme Court is an issue thatwill undoubt-
edly play a major role in Washington under a future
McCain or Obama administration. The Roberts
Court consists of six justices aged 69 or older,
one of which, John Paul Stevens, is 88. Thus, it is
necessary to spell out what kind of judges our na-
tion needs,  McCain and Obama’s divergent
philosophies on the appointment of  to the
federal bench, and forecast the eliects that such ap-
pointments will have on the legal integrity of our

nation.

 

of his own stances on the Constitution are shaky

paign ﬁnance reform — McCain’s commitment to
appointing non-activist  seems genuine.

Obama, who voted against the conﬁrmations
of Roberts andjustice Samuel Alito, t_akes a radi-
cally different approach to his  philosophy.
Injuly 2007, Obama depicted the proﬁle of the
kind of judge he would appoint to the Supreme
Court. ‘

Having a conversation with

with an old friend. It tends to go
like this:

The Pitt News: “Hello, Justin.”

Justin Pierre: “Hello, Justin. Are

TPN: “Not really. And you?”

JP: “Not really. I’m still in my

TPN: “I had class all day. Iwish

Everyone loves an adventure
—— especially teenagers, apparently,
for in “Nick and Norah’s Inﬁnite
Playlist,” the title duo spends an
entire haphazard night exploring
city streets, pursuing their favorite

band. Sound fun? It should.
“Nick and Norah” is a quirky
dramedy following a group of
high schoolers during an exciting
and unpredictable night in New

York City — beginning in a small -,

nightclub, where Nick (Michael
Cera») and his band, The Jerk Offs,

. play to an audience of eager teens,

including Norah (Kat: Dennings).

The evening starts with typical
teenage drama ——- jealousy among
classmates, revenge of the exes,
drunken oblivion — but suddenly
escalates into a sleepless night of
unpredictable adventures. No-
rah’s initial crush on The Jerk
Offs’ emo guitarist, Nick, quickly
ends when she learns he’s the ex-
boyfriend of her “frenemy,” Tris. ‘

But Nick and Norah A -
prompted by the two other Jerk

, Offs — still form a ﬂirtatious, yet

often argumentative, friendship.

Unfortunately, their insecurities

and unwillingness to move on

from past relationships overshad-
ow their "potential ‘for a romantic
relationship. Nick still needs to

‘shed hisleftover feelings for Tris,

and Norah must learn to stop fall-
ing back on her ex—boyfriend, Tal
(“Knocked Up’s” Jay Baruchel).
Each fails to tolerate the whin-
ing and self—pitying of the other,
so -an initial spark loses its ﬂame
quickly. But the duo’s shared love
of a popular underground band,
Where’s Fluffy,acts as the bind-
ing force keeping the two in close
contact as the night unfolds.
Uniting the teens is a scaven-
ger hunt through the boroughs of
New York to find the spot where
their favorite band will perform.

The friends must work together

to unravel the clues — written in
bathroom stalls and announced
over the radio of The ]erk'Offs’

Luckily, the article -then goes

fun at our idiosyncrasies. Let’s call it
our f****ed-_up—edness,” said Pierre.
“And if we’ve affected someone’s
life in a positive way, that’s amazing.
And if we’ve pissed someone off
to the point that they have to write

irate e—mails to tell us how much

we suck, well, that’s pretty amazing,
too. Indifference is the worst thing
that can happen to a ban .”

For three albums running, Mo-
tion City Soundtrack has served as
an alternative thinking Weezer (un-
like Weezer, though, MCS has only
gotten better with age), with taut,
punchy guitars, wildly catchy hooks
and a singer who views the world

, a bit differently than most people.

And for Pierre, life’s always been
about seeing  a bit skewed.
“I’ve never been able to write
a research paper to save my life.
In a college English class, instead

~of wriﬁng something academic,

I chose. to write about how Rich-

ard Gere sucks massive, massive‘

 well, he just sucks,” said Pierre.
“Somehow I got passing grades

without ever learning how to write
areal paper.”

One thing Pierre has learned to. .

do, though, is turn out a hell of a
hook —— Motion City has packed
each of its three albums with more

sing—alongs than a campﬁre — due V

in no small’ part to the superstar
producers who have helped the

band cultivate its best work. Soph— _

saw the band work with Blink 182’s
Mark Hoppus, while Even If It Kill:
Me features tracks that The Cars’
Rick Ocasek produced. I

“V/orking  Hoppus, well,
he is a perfectionist. We had to
do tons of takes to get the sound
right,” said Pierre. “But I was very
confused with our sessions with
Ric Ocasek. I’m happy with the
outcome, but I’d play something
and think it was awful and he’d tell
me, ‘It doesn’t get better than ‘that.’
Then when I thought I’d done well,
he’d'tell me to do it over.”

And somewhere between those
last two albums, Motion City
Soundtrack shifted from a young

is both humbled and honored that
his band might be inspiring other

but now it makes sense to me what

it was like for us to cite other bands «

‘ Don’t be too scared: He was
just kidding. But talking to Pierre, it

becomes obvious that he puts great I

thought into his work, and, by ex-
tension, his words. He pauses often

Pierre, in that way, takes this long

‘ running joke more seriously than

he’d ever let on. ‘

. of genuine chemistry between

these two characters, the titular
twosome that they form is not
as endearing and clever (in terms
of the acting talent) as the ﬁlm’s
advertisements make it seem.. .

’ Asthe characters of the main
duo form a new friendship, they
simultaneously teach one another
valuable lessons about learning
to let go of past relationships,
even if it means that they need

.to do so subconsciously. In each ”

other they ﬁnd a genuineness

V that was lacking from their previ-

ous partners.
The movie’s creative use of
music —— particularly through the

' inﬂuence of the \X/here’s Fluffy

scavenger hunt — provides legit-
imate potential to form an ador-
ably infallible screen couple. But,

_ as actors, Cera and’ Dennings

goesto NYC 

never quite live up to what the I

storyline would make us expect.

Nevertheless, the film» as a‘
whole touches on a universal '
longing for spontaneity and the

hilarity that ensues,

It successfully speaks to not
only those in the same age group
as the characters, but to anyone,

who at one point in his life, had a A

yearning for a fresh start.

‘ “Nick and Norah” prove!‘

that the reign of the teen dram-
edy genre is still running strong.
Although not in the ranks of an
Oscar contender,“Nick and No-
rah” serves as a fantastic method
of escaping real life, while cata-
pulting into an entertaining ride
through the Big Apple.

And it sure is cheaper than re-
ally being there.

like, “Begging you to sit for a portrait on the
wall / To  the dark of some parliamen-
tary hall,” add to the song’s distinctiveness.
The softest song on the album by far is
“Baby You’re My Light,” by Richard Haw—

ley. Its gentle sound lulls the listener into the

sentimental lyrics. The relaxed feel comes at a
good time after the succession of louder, faster
paced songs before it

“Nick & Norah’s Theme,” by Mark Moth-

_ to be a culmination of all the distinctive sounds

song uses range from synthesizer to 
While the album as a whole has a lot of diver-
sity, this final track adds cohesion by combin-
ing characteristics of all the songs.

From the soundtrack it seems as though



“Nick & Norah’s Infinite Playlist” will be as
quirky‘ as the rest of the recent movies starring
Michael Cera. By including less well-known,_
though not less well—loved, artists, it adds la‘
unique touch that makes the audience feel like

Chak-Talk

A tribute to the Voice of the Pirates: Lanny Frattare

by Zack Chakan
Adaidta/it Sparta Editor

“Go, ball, get outta here!”

“There was nooooooo doubt
about it.”

Well, Lanny Frattare is out of
here, but surprisingly, there was doubt

about it:
-’ A

On Wednesday afternoon, the
legendary Pittsburgh Pirates broad-
caster announced his retirement after
33 yearsinthe boothjustlike that,his
two  phrases will disappear

,  the night sky like a Nate McLouth

home run.

Frattare’s departure comes as a
bit of a shock. Even though he spent
more than three decades on the job,
he never hinted at retirement through-
out the 2008 

The Pirates just ﬁnished up their
16th consecutive losing season, 
a baseball and sports record with the
1933-1948 Philadelphia Phillies. Frat-

 

tare announced  every single
game in this era.

A simple numbers crunch ﬁnds
that nearly half of Frattare’s career
took place in the current losing streak.
Of Frattare’s first 17 seasons, the Pi-
rates ﬁnished with losing records in
only six of them.

The sum of those ﬁgures equates
to two—thirds of Frattare’s career sub-
merged in losing  That’s a
lot of defeats

But all the while, he went abouthis
business and was a professional in the
l1't1CSt sense.

Fratiare was never a ﬂashy, look-
at-me type of commentator. He sim-
ply let his voice ﬂow with the game’s
progress,  you feel like you
were  to a classic ballgarne.

With the  of former Steel-
ers’ broadcasting great Myron Cope
this year, Pittsburgr has lost two fa-
miliar and popular voices over the
airwavesthatno onewilleverhear

again.

Greg Brown, the other Pirates’
play-by-play man, will be a suitable
replacement for Frattare. Brown’s
tone and space while  the game
is more exciting than Frattares, and
he works  well with color
commentator and former Bucco Bob
Walk.

the Pirates will probably bring in a
second announcer However, it will
beweirdtolistentobaseballgamesin
Pittsburgh without the familiar Frat-
tare fodder

Polar extremes mark Frattare’s
career. The ultimate  came ﬁrorn
Pittsburgh’s last Woiid Series title,

the “We Are ’ squad of 1979.

He was also able to call some decent
teams in the early 1980s“ and in the
Barry Bonds-Doug Drabek era in the
early 1990s 0

The Pirates reached the National
League Championship Series three
straight  fromi.:1_990—92. The
Bucoos lost each one, though, includ-

Brownwillbeuptothetask,and'

ing the heartbreaking walkoﬁ’ loss to
the Atlanta Braves in 1992

That was the game where Bonds
couldn’t throw out Sid Bream at
home to send the game to extra in-
nings. Bonds never wore the Pirates
uniforrnagainlthinkmydadis still
crying from that day.

Frattare also called the Francisco
Cordova-Ricardo Rincon combined,
extra-inning no-hitter in 1997.

Unfortunately, he also voiced
some pretty pathetic baseball teams
inthelast 16yearsThePirates area
combined 315 games under .500 in
their 16 losing seasons _

Because of the "duration of this I

ineptness, Pittsburghers will likely re-
member Frattare more for the losing
streak than the   of
Ye5tefYe3I- '

In the past few years, losingﬁnally
seemed to show some wear on Frat-
tare. He tendedto ramble on about
non—baseball—related issues more "of-
tren,perhapsinaneﬂForttospiceup

the  product on the diamond.
But he still displayed unbridled
passion for the Pirates and baseball _
I remember one instance in the
ﬁrst week of the 2008 season. Pitts-
burgh pitcher Paul Maholrn (who
would go on to have a brilliant season)
was cruising against the Florida Mar-
In the ﬁfth  an infield single,
hit-by-pitch and walk loaded the bases
for Marlin slugger Mike Jacobs with
two outs Pitches later; Jacobs abso-
lutely destroyed a ball to right-center_
As the ball zoomed off of Ja-
cobs’ bat, Frattare let out a defeated
“Noooooooo!”  V .
Frattare loved the Pirates, and e
Pirates loved Frattare. Even tho
theteamhasletfansdownover Te
years, Frattare did the best he could to
enliven their experience of the game
Thanks, Lanny. You'll be missed.
And there is no doubt about it; A _

Panthers luring top
talent on field, court

by JP Hanish
Staff IV/‘ire/'

Bearing in mind LeSean McCoy,]onathan
Baldwin and Dejuan Blair, the Pitt Panthers
have not had trouble adding quality play-
ers to the school. With 11 football and four
basketball players already committed, Pitt is
adding even more talent for 2009.

Defensive end jack Lippert and running
back Raymond Graham highlight the foot-
ball class.

The 6—foot—3—inch, 245—pound Lippert
chose the Panthers over Boston College in
late June. Rivals.com rated him as the sev-
enth best defensive end in the nation and
one of the top 10 players in Pennsylvania.

Scouts like Lippert’s ability to shed
blocks while defending against the run, and
they also like that he outworks many of his
opponents. Coupled with his technique and
athleticism, Lippert could become a big part
of the Panther defense in the coming sea-
sons.

On the other side of the ball, coach Dave
Wannstedt will be adding a solid running
back in Raymond Graham.

Also rated in the Pennsylvania top 10
by rivals.com, Graham picked the Panthers
over Maryland and Connecticut.

Graham uses solid speed and vision to
attack the defense, and his compact frame
allows for powerful ﬁnishes to runs. Last
year, he averaged more than 175 yards per
game until he ‘suffered a broken collarbone
that ended his season.

Of the other nine players joining Lippert
and Graham, ﬁve will be linemen.

Tyrone Ezell could become a defensive
end or tackle, depending on how much
he builds on his 6—foot—4—inch, 250—pound
frame. Cory King is the largest player that
Pitt has added, at 6 feet 5 inches and 300
pounds. He will likely become a guard along
the offensive line. Locally, Aliquippa stand-
outjuantez Hollins will join an already dom-
inant western Pennsylvania presence in the

Panthers’ locker room.

In basketball, coach Jamie Dixon landed
one of the top 20 players in the country
with Dante Taylor.

The 6—foot—9—inch, 230-pound power ‘
forward may become Pitt’s first McDonald’s 
All-American player since Bobby 

and Brian Shorter in 1987.

Pitt’s style of play interested and attracted ‘

Taylor. He noted Pitt’s tendency to feed the

post and liked that the guards push the ball. -

But what brought Taylor to the program

was Pitt’s early interest in him, especially,

from assistant coach Tom Herrion, who re-
cruited him.
Taylor will likely start at power forward

after Sam Young graduates next year. Help

brings a physical presence to the Panthers’

lineup and has a very polished offensive;
game for his size. The only downside is that ’
he might be talented enough to enter the_
NBA Draft after his freshman or sopho—i

more year.

Joining Taylor will be three other for-

wards. Lamar Patterson is a 6—foot-5-inch,

220—pound small forward from St. Bene- 3

dict’s Prep in New Jersey. Power forwards

 Richardson and Talib Zanna will give Pitt .

depth in its frontcourt. Zanna announced
his commitment last weekend.

Unfortunately for Pitt, Darnell Dodson
will not be a part of the 2009 class.

"Dodson enrolled at Pitt in the summer,

of 2007, but officials deemed him acaderr1i—
cally ineligible. He attended Miami-Dade ju-

nior College with the intention to enroll at 

Pitt again in 2009.

Because of a Big East conference rule,
Dodson will not be back this year. The rule
states that any non—qualiﬁer who enrolls at

a Big East school cannot enroll again after .

attending a two—year institution.

As a result, Dodson will not be allowed toi T

attend any Big East school. He will have to
complete his second season at Miarni-Dade
and attend another Division I program. At
that point, Dodson will have three years of
