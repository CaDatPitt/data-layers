Col. '31, are meeting the intercol-
legiate debaters of Penn State Col-
lege in Pittsburgh, another two-man

- team will be arguing against the

burgh last night. Fishkin and
Crowder will argue the affirmative
of the unemployment insurance
question.

This will be the ﬁrst time for the
Pitt men to take part in what is
known as the Oregon style debate.
Und-er this plan, the ﬁrst speaker on

‘Mercy’ Has An Unmerciful
Meaning To At Least One
Of Two Albert Swantzes

,,__

Albert Swartz. Eng. ’32, like
Archilles, the Greek god who
was dipped in the river Styx,
has a body immune to harm-
all but his heel.

This, his heel, was severely
iniured as a result of .a curious
coincidence. While he was, by
mistake, rushing to the Mercy
hospital to answer a call for a
blood ’transfusion, the Albert
Swartz who was supposed to
answer the call, a freshman in-
the college, was up at the yin
giving his blood for his ni-
versity during a boxing match.

Albert Swartz, the ﬁrst, after
a motorcycle accident on the
way, was taken with an injured,
bleeding heel to the hospital.
Albert Swartz, the second, after
being knocked around by his
boxing opponent up at the gym,
was taken with a bleeding nose
to his home at the Sigma Alpha
Mu house.

Each, later found out the mis-
take made in confusing two per-
sons with the same names.

Food Proposal

Council Considers Plans For
Cathedral Room

The proposal for the co-operative

1 buying of foodstuffs" was brought up

for its annual discussion at Inter-
fraternity Council Tuesday evening,
and was tabled for further consider-
ation at the next meeting.

The plan which was introduced by
Bernard Windt, Bus. Ad. ’32, Pi
Lambda Phi, provided for a system
whereby a manager will be installed
to have all responsibility in caring
for accounts and seeing that—every-
thing 0 erated smoothly. It was
proposed) that one meat dealer was

Voted Down Once

A similar proposal made two
years ago was voted down when fra-
ternities expressed the opinion that
they were not ﬁnancially able to as-
sume the burden of installation of
the system.

Other business taken up at this
week's meeting included reports of
committees on the Fraternitygroom
in the Cathedral; pledge dinner, and
fraternity discussion groups. ‘

Believing that the program for the
rest of the year was too crowded to
warrant a dinner for pledges, Milton
Shore, Phi Epsilon Pi, recommended
that December 8 be reserved next
year for the dinner to be given for
the neophytes.

Plan Cathedral Room

Thomas McClain, Phi Delta Theta,
chairman of the fraternity room
committee, reported that a confer-
ence would be held with Dean of Men
Robert C. Clothier and John Weber,
University business manager, to con-
sider plans for‘ the room which
would be placed on the men’s ﬂoor of
the new building. Interfraternity
Council has already reserved 3400 to
be used in furnishing this room.

Beginning Monday, March 16, and
continuing for three weeks a series
of discussions led by local ministers
and University faculty members will
be held in the various fraternity
houses. This program has been spon-
sored by Interfraternity Council and
the Y. M. C. A. for the past three
years.

Bridge Tournament

Annguncement was also made at
the meeting of the Greeks of an in-
terfraternity bridge tournament
which will get under way early in
March. Charles Hugus, Theta Delta
Psi, will be in charge.

ment, Mr. McClurkin, a graduate

Religious-Scientiﬁc
Lecture Gets Crowd

The ﬁrst of the four lectures on
“The Relation of Religion. to Mod-
ern Trends in Scientiﬁc and Social
Thought” attracted a large group
of faculty and administration offi-
cers. The meeting was held in
Room 105, Thaw Hall, Monday af-

ternoon, March 2. About one hun-

dred faculty men were present. The

main speaker was Dr. Heber D. Cur-
tis, formerly of the University, now
head of the department of astron-
omy at the University of Michigan.
The discussion was led by Profes-
sor Karl D. Swartzel, head of the
department of mathematics and Dr.
Arthur E. Ruark, professor of phys-
ics. Dean L. P. Sieg presided.

Dr. Curtis stated that recent
trends in scientiﬁc thinking had
greatly changed the dogmatic spirit
of scientists of a generation ago
who felt cock-sureness about science
having the last word on the nature
of the universe. Too many scien-
tists who had discovered a working
hypothesis assumed that their the-
ories were permanent. ‘

Dr. Curtis maintained that sci-

‘encehad made practically no modi-

ﬁcations in the essential nature of
religion. It had»only changed some
non-_essential_ beliefs._ The assump-
tions of the spiritual nature -of _the
universe made by the psalmists
three thousand years ago stands as
good a foundation as the assump-
tions about the universe which peo-
ple make today.

The second meeting will be_held
on Monday, March 9. The topic is:
“The Basis of Morals.” The'speak-
ers are Professors M. R. Gabbert,
Andrey A. Avinoff, Roswell  John-
soéi. Dr. E. R. Weidlein will pre-
S‘l e. '

ries of ﬁve lectures at the regular

ation of form utilities. A clear con-

of economic activity, was given.

There have been many radical
changes in the .methods of whole-
sale and retail distribution in the
past ten" years. The speaker gave
as examples the establishment of
branch stores by mail order houses,
the change of policies in department
stores, and in some cases, the estab-
lishment of branches in suburban
sections by them. Then too, the

portant factor in the retail distribu-
tion ﬁeld.

rest of Mr. Worcester’s lectures are
as follows: March 10, “Buying

Coeds Enlist New Tactics;
Anything To Win Heart
Of Unsuspectiug Male

If cooking's the way to a man's
heart, the Northwestern Mounted
won’t have a thing on Pitt coeds-—
for these coeds can cook! Just ask
Mrs. Foster, supreme ruler of Henna
House kitchen, who grow positive-
ly indignant if one dares ask. “DQ
the girls burn things?” And don’t
thing that beans make‘ up the menu
—no ma’am. Everything from SP8-
ghetti to chicken and from roast
beef to salmon salad.

Lunches are 0 prepared 11P_ '3?
Heinz House at least or four times
a week. These are made for  S.
G. A. meetings, W. A._A. meeting‘-S.
Y. W. C. A. class meetings and oth-
ers. Every evening ﬁnds some group
-—-often two groups-—of coeds busy
preparing dinner for some occasion
or other, whether it be for the de-
bating club, Panhelleni'c Council,
Quax Club, Student Council or Mor-
tar Board.

Of course, we hope this advertise-
ment doesn’t cause the football
team, basketball team or what have

tices at Heinz House.

Cub Discovers Butterfly; .

If some enterprising young Zoolo-
gy student rushes toward you one
of theseﬁne days with a tale about

the strange butterﬂy uncovered, re-_

vealed, or discovered at the Pitt de-
partment, you should immediately
perceive that a musca domestica is
in the ungeunt or you even might
smell a rodentum.

Be that as it may though, we
rushedover to scoop the papers of
the world with the great discovery.
We pictured urselves hailed as the
"8'1'ea’§§-Vi-}<1)‘c’>rter of the age” and
ha,d/“even planned interviews with

»c***"'-“the head of the department con-

cerning the new butterﬂy. All we
could learn from our informant was
that it was a big blue one and had
never been seen before at the de-
partment, or at any department for
that matter.
“Animalium”

Alas and alack we saw the other
colleges of _the world eclipsed with
the great biological discovery in our
own laboratory. We had even
planned a name for the thing, call-
ing it the “Animalium Decouvertum
Williamsensis,” which simply means
“The Animal Discovered by Wil-
liams.” In a da_v\or so, undoubted-
ly, the press of the world would hail
the discovery and cover our beloved
alma mater with glory.

So with a pencil sharpened and
our kodak in hand to photograph
the new arrival we set out for No.

Radio Band At
Military Ball

Austin Wylie Plays Music;
Ticket Contest Keen

 

Austin Wylie’s thirteen-piece or-
chesta will furnish the music for
the Military Ball in the grand ball-
room of the Schenley Hotel on Fri-
day evening, March 20, stated Ed-
gar M. Wittan, Bus. Ad. ‘31, chair-
man of the committee, af.er a meet-
ing of th. group Tuesday after-
noon.

This nationally-famed orchestra
has just terminated a lengthy en-
gagement at the new China restaur-
ant in Cleveland, and previous to
that furnished the dance music at
the Golden Pheasant in the same
city. His music was broadcast
frequently over radio
WTAM, and Pittsburghers who
heard him at that time are elo uent
in their praise of this premier and
leader.

Competition Keen

In the competition for the excel-
lence guidon to be presented to the
battery selling the greatest number
of the tickets for the ball, Bat-
tery A is leading, Battery B is a
close second, and Batteries C and D
are tied for third place. Tickets for
the affair. may be purchased from
members of the R. O. T. C. at the
Military Department and from mem-
bers of the committee at the price
of three dollars. '

Favors for the dance have been
received, and Chairman Wittan ex-
pressed great satisfaction with
them. Due to an extremely fortu-
nate purchase, a type of favor far
superior to those usually presented
at such affairs has been obtained.

Coed Freshmen Plan '

had encountered such people as Mc-
nley Williams and Dambuch.

“How about that new discovery?”
we as ed Mr. Wallace, who was
busy p eparing an -xamination for
the young zoologists or zoologikers.
“What discovery ?" he asked ap-
parently joking with our ignorance.
“Why the new butterﬂv. the discov-
ery of the age,” we replied openin
the camera and getting the penc'
all set. .
Rare Thing, Too

“Well, if you're another of those
who -run around for scoops,” he re-
plied, “there it is.” And he pointed
to a big beautiful blue butterﬂy
hanging from the chandelier or
whatever you call those brass things
in No. 2 Frick Acres. -

We snapped the Kodak. Zot sev-
eral good poses and even had Mr.
Wallace standing next to the but-
terﬂy beaming with pride. Some-
how, that smile wasn’t the smile of
a conoveror.

Disillusiovned? Oh, No!

“May we examinemthe thing 1"’. we
asked, advancing to the table and
admiring the blue beautv hanging
there. “Of course,” he replied, “but
be careful.” So we went over. cut
the thing down and here’s what en-
sued. '

_ The butterﬁy’s wings, those beau-
tiful blue wings, were in ‘do of tissue

small closepin and the. antennae
were two pieces of horsetail. The
coloring, the. marine blue, was

Student Mailbag

Editor of the Pitt Weekly:
Realizing that we avowedly and
friendly hold different views on the
social-order, and that nothing can
come of bickering over differences of
opinion, I had intended to pass up
your editorial “Pessimistic Views" in
the current issue of The Weekly
(Friday, February 27, 1931), dealing
with Norman Thomas’ assembly pres-
entation. But having had the idea
suggested to me by severalother stu-
dents who were of thetsame mind, I
make bold to criticize the editorial on
the grounds of its “missing the
point."

1. The editorial attempts the ver-
bal slaying of Mr. Thomas by the
eloquent appeal: “Did Mr. Thomas of-
fer much in the line of constructive
argument?” And thereby hangs a
tale: Mr. Thomas has too great a
mind to think he has offered some-
thing adequately constructive if.he
has not; certainly be is qualiﬁed to
list speciﬁc projects. But such was
‘not his task in a brief forty-minute
address aimed at impressing upon us
the urgent need for genuine unbiased
thinking. Elsewhere in the issue, a
Weekly reporter accurately grasped
the idea. and the editorial writer
would have done well to read the re-
porters account more carefully:
“. . . the world has a right to ask
that the college man have a pro-

become independent in thought, and
ready to assist in the salvation of
mankind.”

2. “. . . surely Mr. Thomas would
not exchange places with the labor-erg
and serfs of the 17th and 18th cen
turies." This time-worn device and
method of answering any questioning
of the status quo was adequately an-
swered in Thomas’ address. Of course,
the laborers are better off in some
ways: but not IN PROPORTION to
progress generally. “We must judge
not by the past, but by what might
be right now."

3. Certainly, Mr. Thomas would
have no quarrel with the ‘ﬁnal lofty
sentiment .of the editorial: “The same
factors of science, commercialism.
and education which Mr. Thomas said
would produce another war, can also
prevent that war." Perhaps no one
is working more sincerely for such
an intelligent prevention of war than
Norman Thomas. But this does ’not
remove the necessity of facing ra-
tionally the, black facts of V,

Told By Dr. Oliver
On charter Day

By DR. JOHN

At the dinner held Saturday
in observance of the University
Charter Day, Dr. John W.
Oliver, head of the department
of history, spoke on “The Be-

cinning," relating the events in
he early years,of the institu-
tion now bearing the name of
Pitt. Because of the interesting
facts revealed in his talk, Dr.
Oliver has agreed to furnish
readers of the Pitt Weekly
with a. brief resume of his ad- -
dress.

In a discussion of the early days
of the University, I believe that the
ﬁrst record worth noting is an an—‘
nouncement which appeared in the
“Pittsburgh Gazette,” September 7,
1786. It read: I

“The situation of the town of
Pittsburgh is greatly to be chosen
,as a seat of learning; the ﬁne
air, the excellent water, and the
plenty and cheapness of provi-
sions make it ideal for locating
an academy here.” , i

This was apparently the’ real be-
ginning of the University of Pitts-
burgh.
Such an announcement immediate-
ly challenges one’s curiosity. He is.
eager to know what kind of. people
were living out here at that time.
How many inhabitants were there

hereaboutis? What were they do-
ing for a living? What were they
thinking?

By 17.86, one year before the
Pittsburgh Academy was founded,
a traveler in our midst noted ﬁve
stores, 36 log houses, one stone
house and‘ one frame house. The

with more than 900 persons living
in the district round about the
Point. As to the professional
group, there was only one clergy-
man, four lawyers and one doctor.
The observations of this traveler
are more favorable, however, than
were those of Mr. Arthur Lee, a
Revolutionary diplomat, who had
visited many of the capitals of Eur-
ope. He was back in America in
1785, and paid a visit to Pittsburgh
and made these notes: “The place
is inhabited almost wholly by Scotch
and Irish, who live in paltry log
houses. There is not a priest or
clergyman of any persuasion, nor
church nor chapel. The place will
never, I believe, amount to much.”

Rapid Growth

Despite Mr.' Lee's prediction that
“this place would never amount to
much,” the facts seem to point oth-
erwise. The Post-Revolutionary imi-

out here in surprising numbers. One
writer estimated that within the
two years, 1787-88, upwards of 16,-
000 persons arrived in Pittsburgh.
True, they did not all remain here.
Only a fractional part, c in fact,
made this their home. But when the
ﬁrst federal census was taken two
years later, in 1790, thertown had
a population of 376 persons, and
Allegheny county had 10,322.
Already a few private schools
had been proposed. A pioneer in
the teaching profession announced
in an early issue of ‘the old “Ga-
zette,” that he would open a school
“to teach Latin, the reading of
English grammatically, writing and
arithmetic, and an evening school
to care for the boys who are em-
ployed during the day.” A fore-
runner of the modern downtown di-
vision! - s V
This,‘ and other illustrations that
one could cite, prove that there
was, even at this early date, a
thirst for things, intellectual, cul-
tural. The demand could not be
met by private tutoring, and so in
late summer of 1786 appeared the

that called attention to the advan-
tages in. Pittsburgh for founding an
academy here4—-its ﬁne air, its ex-

cheapness of provisions.

Hugh H. Brackenridge

And since’ Brackenridge typiﬁes
the Founding Fathers, and his life
best illustrates the cultural life out
of which the old bcademy developed,
a word might be added here. He ar-
rived in Pittsburgh in 1781, six
years before the academy was or-
ganized. He was a. Princeton grad-
uate, having studied under old Dr.
Witherspoon. He was a classmate
of Philip Freneau and James Madi-
son.» And like them, had specialized
in history, politics and literature.

He and Philip Freneau had jointly

written the commencement poem

the impressive title, ‘ “The _
Glory of America.” It fairly bris-

sports are not only considered minor

also bold but little interest for the sthdent body. \

There is little left to do in such a case, except to write about some
of the various non-athletic activities which are on the calendar, as ten-
nis, outdoor track, and spring football practice are still far away.

The Cap and Gown boys staged their initial tryouts‘Tuesday
evening in the Activities building; and from the looksof the large
turnout, in great deal of noisy accompaniment is promised the

_ Weekly stall’ when they do the greater portion of their work on
Tuesdays and Wednesdays, as the opening date of this year’s
production is little more, than a month away; and what the
boys have missed thus far in the late start, they will atone for
until the end of rehearsals with inspired volume.

Well do we remember the times we pulled at our hair, last

- year, as the combined noise of dancing feet, singing _voices and
piano pounding reached our ears, just as‘ we were writlng a mas-_

terpiece. The same seems to be in store for us again this year;
‘but, like last year, I guess we’ll. have to make the most of it.

But, coming back from our littiedigression, -we would like to put in a
ﬁnal words of praise for the Pitt basketballteam. . . . . 1 A
As the reader will recall,‘ at the beginning of the season‘ when we

were young at the game and didnot know that the least sensible thing
in the world which a man could do 'wa.s_-to predict the outcome of games,
we said that the Pitt basketball team would lose six games this season.

The schedule calls fo_r,},the— Panthers to play but three more

— games .this—season,,witl_1 Penn, West Virginia, and Penn State, all .

albx-oad;vand the team has lost but four gamesthus far. Inasmuch ; _ V‘

as none of the teams yet to be played boasts‘ of an exceptionally
good record or even a fair one, the Panthers can be expected to
ﬁnish their campaign without losing any more games. ,
If they should accomplish this feat, then they will have a
better record than that of the team of 1928-1929 which boasted
of Hyatt, Zchfuss, Les Cohen and Gyp Wunderlich. That team
won 16 games and lost ﬁve, while this year's aggrogation has 1

lost but four games out

of twenty-one played to

date.

The records simply prove that the Pitt victories in the past were

not all Hyatt-earned, and they ﬁrmly establish Coach “Red” Carlson as

thebiggest, reason, for the success of the, Panthers during the past

four years.

The good doctor isA“razzedl~’ unmercifully at? times because of his

habit of instructing officials during

:3

the ‘course of a game and of feed-'

ing his players ice cream after mos-tof their practice sessions.

Few fans

know that Carlson pays for the ice cream out of his own

pocket. He loves the school, and he feels that by giving it the best basket-
ball teams possible, he can repay the debt he owes it for the education

whi h he received here. Basketball

terback is the defending broad jump
champion and he should repeat
again this year. He will have some
stiff competition from Lamoine

athlete, who is the present national
junior broad jump champion.» The‘
mile relay team composed of Har-
ris, Vitulla, Monheim and Watkins

his is to take a make-up exam in

By EDWARD J. HIRSHBERB,
Captain, Pitt Football Team

The time seems to have arrived
for that unrealistic group, termed
the undergraduate body, to be en-
lightened concerning the complica-
tions which the organization of a
riﬂe team affords. Offhand, one
would infer that the most serious
complication which could occur
would be for one member of the
riﬂe team to -point _a loaded riﬂe at
another and‘ pull the trigger, thus
causing leadto be projected forci-
bly into the anatomy of said mem-
ber of the riﬂe team; and, besides
arousing complications with the so-
cial law of our city, also create the
complications ‘which lead in the
stomach or shoulder ‘might cause.
But such a situation would be
meager and uninvolved compared to
the complications which have actu-
ally arisen. . .

The most complicated thing, per-
haps, would be for Sergeant _A. A.
Gunter, the amiable coach of the
riﬂe team, to make a light of com-
prehension dawn in the eyes of any-
one not included "in his one hundred
and forty-ﬁve candidates, after he
nishes explaining the endorsed
methods of trigger pulling and
breathing. According to . “Sarg.”
Gunter, you squeeze the trigger in

-thesame manner that you squeeze

a. sponge (perhaps sponge is a new
name for a gold-digging femme!)
Well anyway, after you learn to
squeeze a trigger like a sponge, you
must then perfect your breathin :
If a shooter permits the slightest

amount of oxygen to pass ‘his,
clenched teeth as" he pulls the trig-_

ger, his marksmanship will be rot-
ten, perhaps lousy.

Another complicated aspect of the
riﬂe team is the manner in which
they compete against the riﬂe teams
of other universities. They do so in

a sort of a remote control mannezx-

That is, the Pitt boys ﬁre at targets
which have been sent to the local
R.O.T.C. authorities from Wash-
ington, D. C. These targets a.‘

stamped, numbered and recorded.

After the Pitt team holds its par‘:

of the match, the punctured targets
are returned to the officials in Wash-
ington, who subsequently compile
the scores and inform the various
schools of the results. This ‘takes

the responsibility of losing a match 5

off the shoulders of the contestants
themselves, and places it upon the
honesty of the boys in Washington.

The University of Pittsburgh has
two men’s riﬂe teams, one being the.
varsity team, which is comprised of
ten men, and the other being the
R.O.T.C. team, which is comprised

of ﬁfteen men. Some shooters hold.

It is that narrow, elongated wooden
structure just inside the main en-

At each loophole is poised a marks-
man, pis eye ﬁxed intently upon the
target. Thetargets are ﬁfty feet

upon a sliding apparatus. This en-
ables the marksman to crank their

Oak Manor became widely knowr.
for “The Third Presrbyterian Church
\Suppe.rs” which its ﬁrst three own-
ers—-A. A. Hardy, T*homa.s Williams
and J. C. Bidwell--held the-re. On
these occasions long tables were
stretched across the full length of
a suite of three large rooms on one
side of the house. People came long
distances even inbad weather to at-
tend tllese “Third P'resbyte»rian
Church Suppers” -which were known
not onlyfor their good things to
eat but also for the genial llospi-
tality that was extended to all visi-
tors.- I ' ‘

Robert Kennedy was the fourth
owner of Oak Manor and lived hap-
pily here with his family until one
summer day when one of his chil-
dren—-a boy, six years o-ld——was
drowned in the private swimming
pool out in the lawn. The family
went to. Europe the following fall
and never returned to their old
homestead. ‘ .

In 1897, Henry Kirvche Porter,
president of the H, K.‘P.orrter Loco-
motive Company and l~ate.r 3. Con-
gressman from the Pittsburgh dis-
trict, purohased Oak Manor. H-e and
his wife immediately set about‘ re-
modeling their new home. A wing
was added to the building as an art
gallery for the Porters’ ﬁne collec-
tion of old paintings. Some of the
interior features were re-arranged
and others were replaced. The
swilnmi-ngcpool in the lawn was cov-
ered up; roses and shrubs were
planted about the grounds.

Distinguished ‘Guests .

Here the locomotive manufactur-
er and his wife entertained many
notable per-sons during the next
few years with parties, balls, teas
and luncheons.‘ Some of -the distin-
guished people who were entertained
by the Porters at Oak Manor’ were
Chauncey Depew, Mr. and Mrs.
George Vanderbilt, Thomas Bailey
Aldrich, President and Mrs. Grover
Cleveland and Andrew Carnegie.

After Mr. Porter was -elected
Congressman, the Porters spent ‘most
of their time’ at their equally ﬁne
residence in Washington. Fo-r a
few years they lived in each of their
homes for short in~tervals, but not
wi.sh.ing to keep both homes open,
they decided to close up ‘Oak Man-

New Attractions To Feature
Number Out March 23

Inspired by such screen epics as
“Cimarron” and such books as “Des-
ert Gold,” the Pitt Panther, fun
magazine of the University, is
preparing a wild and wooly western
number to be published March 23.
According to Panther officials, the
“West” extends from McKees Rocks
to the Paciﬁc Ocean, and the ‘editors
are sure that they , have a big
enough subject to work on this time.

The writers will take pot shots at
all the romantic hooey and, theblood
and thunder ﬁction that has been
unloaded on a guillblelpublic ever
since LaSalle, Pizarro and Lewis
and Clark discovered“ the West in
1619. ‘ - 
Screaming Drama

On every stirring page, the Pan-
ther plans‘ to re-shoot all the In-
dains that Custer ﬁlled so full of -lead
in Wyoming, re-discover California
gold, and in short, re-enact the
bleeding, screaming, passionate
drama of the, settlement of the
Golden West. — ‘

The Pitt student who fails to read
this wild and wooly issue from cover
to cover will miss a liberal Western
education,” says Sunny Weslager,
Col. 332, editor of the Panther.

“The staff of the Panther has put
the great West back on the map,”
says Hiram Howard, editor. —‘..‘My
faith in Buffalo Bill has been vin-
dicated.” ' . 
These and Those

Among the new attractions with
which the. new Panther staff is bid-
ding for student favor are the
original ff.These and Those” by Ruth
Malone and Lee Kramer, a- new
page by Eddie‘ 1-Iirshberg, football
captain; a brilliant “Theatre? page
by Marvin T. Herrick; a new fash-
ion page, and a sport page by Mor-
ris_Cohen, Weekly sports editor,
which contains no predictions or
scores. . '

Frosh Mermen Beat 1
Kiski, Westinghouse

The Panther cub natators con-
tinued their already prolonged win-
ning streak by swamping the Kiski
swimming team last Sa.tul'~day eve-
ning at Kiski and the Westinghouse
mermen last Tuesday at Westing-
house by the scores of 43-16Iand
51.-8, -respectively. I

As can be seen by the score, the
Kiski meet was the more interest-
ing of the two. Although the, Pitt
boys‘ were clearly the superior. the
Kiski swimmers were nevertheless
ableto extend them. Norton and
Adlersberg were the stars for the
winning team, Norton-' winning the
45 and the 100-yard‘ free styles
and Adlersberg taking the 220-
yard; free style 7 and ﬁnishing

Both also swam on the. winning,lre-
lay. . - -

The Pitt men took every ﬁrstand
second place in the Westinghouse

free style which Denny of the Silver
Lakrs copped. Norton, Carik and
Adlersbergl all looked good in this
meet. Norton once again copped
two ﬁrsts, while the other two Pitt
men‘ each took one ﬁrst besides
placing in other events. .
Today the Panthers will attempt
to‘ take the South Hills high ‘team
into camp and thus
string of victories intact.

, Over on the opposite corner of

,Be1le~ﬁel.d-and Fifth algenue-s, the ex-

cavation for the nlew"Mellon Insti-
tute is almost completed. It is 35
feet deep, dug down to a platform
of solid natural rock, upon which
the immense, structure will rest, and

303 feet wide by 305 feet long, one

hundred thousand cubic yards of
earth have been removed to make
room,fo.r this huge hole, the larg-
est excavation ever made in Alle-
gheny county. Fifty-eight eight-room
dwelling —ho»use-s could be
into this deep chasm and not a_
chimney would protrude above the
surface of the ground, it has been
estimated. Indiana limestone, sim-
ilar to that I in ..the Cathedral, will
be used for the new Mellon Insti-
tute. _ .. ‘

The ﬁrst shipment will be made
sometime this spring from the
quarries and mills in Bedford, In-

carloads of stone, 125 more carloads

 E have been in the tobacco business a long ‘

time down here. at Winston- Salem and we take

a lot of pride in. the quality of lthecigarettes we . ~

make.

While we. have spent a good many million

dollars advertising Camels, we’ve always held H;
to the old fashioned idea that the thing that . .

really coilnts is what we put into our cigarette
and not what we say about it.‘ -

If we know anything about tobacco,‘ andwe
think we do, Camels contain the choicest Turk-
ish and the mellowest,

In fact we have every reason to be proud of
the quality -of Camels as they come-from the
factory, but the remark of an old friend of ours
from Denver sometime ago emphasized a‘ point
that has been the problem of the cigarette

' industry for years.

As he inhaled the smoke from a Camel we

- . gave  in our offices one morning, lgesighed ‘

with very evident enjoyment and thenasked

I _ jokingly, “What is this, .3 special blend re-

served‘ for Camel executives?”

_“Cei'tainly 1‘1’ot,"”.we_ told him.. “This package

_ I of Camels was bought atthe corner store this
 -'mo_rning.’-’ _- -

0 “Well,” he said, “I’ve  a dyed in the wool
Camel smoker for a good many years, but upon

- my soul I never got a cigaretteias good as this in
Denver. If you would give the rest of the world '

the kind of Camels you sell‘ herein Winston-
Salem, you ought to have all the cigarette. busi-
ness. there is.” * A 1

THAT‘ statement simply em-

sphasized again the cigarette‘
industry’s most important

problem. . The imore we
thought about it, the isurer
we _, were that ‘ he was dead

‘ / right, and that somehow,

something must  done.

A Denver wasn’ t gettingai

any other town. The only peo-
ple who really knew how good

I ‘ Camels could be,were the folks

right here in Winston-Salem.

That was due to a factor no
cigarette manufacturer. had

ever been able to control. ~ .

too. But up to now there has been a very real
difference in the condition of the cigarettes by

the time théy reached the smoker. J

The ﬂavor and mildness of ﬁne tobacco
depend upon the retention of its natural, not
added, moisture content which is prime at
about ten percent. A

In spite of our great-.pai:ns always to make

sure Camels left. the factory with just the right _

amount of natural moisture, no cigarette pack-
age had ever, yet been designed that could'pre-

-I vent ‘that "precious moisture from drying out.

_ THERE are three things about a cigarettethat
can sting the tongue and unkindly burn the
"throat. g - ~ - - - V - ‘

(1). Cheap _tobacco:.i

(2) Particles .ofpeppery],di’¢8,t. left in the
, ~ , tobacco because of inefficient clean-

(3) A parched cl‘:-y condition‘ of the to-
 bacco due to los,s"of‘uat1_u°,al moisture
by overéheatingior evaporation. 4

Always certain of the quality of our tobaccos
we had already made Can1eI"a.“dus.,t_le.ss"’ jcig-’
arette by the use of a specially designedvacuum

cleaning apparatus exclusive with our factory. P

Now, if we could perfect a package that would

i actually act as alhumidor and ret-aivnthc natu- " A

I could enjoy Camels as much as we do here at

Winston-Sailem. _ A
