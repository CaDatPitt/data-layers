we would like to know ourselves, we are writing to you
for your oponions and suggestions. ‘ '

The 1943 Owl, as you know, has just come home

the importance of helping to keep alive the spirit and

For Saving

National Red Cross Certiﬁcate of -Merit has been awarded
to Private Otto Frohwein, Company E, of the army specialized
engineers stationed at the University, for persistance and
heroism in the rescue of two men who had already been pro

nounced dead, and the saving

award was made last Tuesday at a ceremony in Carnegie

Lecture Hall. ’ ’

While Private Frohwein was on duty as swimming
structor at a pool in Camp Wheeler, Macon, Georgia, on Jul.

28, a bolt of lightning struck

into the pool. Twenty officers and men in the class, paraly“ze_d
by ‘the bolt, began sinking and calling for help. —

. Private Frohwein immediately began the task of’rescu_in'

them. Helpcame, and all the

a nearby tree and glanced offr

men were removed from the

pool. Four, however, were pro-’v>—

nounced dead. Frohwen refused to
give up, and worked over these four

persistently, administering artiﬁci- .

al« respiration, until two of them,.a
lieutenant and a sergeant, were re-
vived. . 
Private Frohwein’s determina-
tion to carry on the rescue work
and his persistence in administer-
ing artiﬁcial respiration saved the

men. _
The certiﬁcate of merit was pre-
sented by Colonel Edward L. Kelly,
Commandant of the University
post. It is an award approved by
President Roosevelt and rarely pre-
sented. v '
Private Otto Frohwein’s home is
in St. Albans, New York. He has
been assigned to the U_niver_s_ity
contingent since August. '

Editor’s Note: Things have been changing so rapidly .around
Pitt that even those of us who have been here for four years do not
know all the details. This is particularly» true of some of the changes
made in the various organizations on campus. This is the first in a
series of articles about the organizations which have made important
changes. It is our hope that through these articles you will come to
know Pitt better. Since ESGC is the newest and perhaps the least
understood organization, we have selected it for this first artcile.

gated to ESGC. All‘ campus 
groups submit. requests for dates..

to contribute their ideas and criti- -

By DAVE BARBOUR

I found some tidbits that might
interest you, engineer or not . . .
What the hell, read it anyway . . .
The double E Dept. isn’t content

like Dorothea Franklin for a secre-
tary; they have to get sweet Mary
Lou McFall too (you know, she’s
the one who made you run into the
water cooler in the Tuck Shop) . . .
You college twerps can say that
Engineers are dull, etc., etc., but
they know how to pick secretaries
. . . And then there’s Polly—the
darling of the Chem.E. dept. (ask
Dr. Bishop) . . . "
I saw smoke coming out of"
Herby Kohn’s ears Tuesday, and,
upon inquiring, found that one
William O’Donnel made him very
unhappy" . . . It seems that Mr.
Herby (plus
Markowitz and Burroughs) take-
potentiometer readings until six
o’clock——only O’Donnel left at
three-thirty . . . I've. heard fellows
curse-—but not like that . . .

. An all-time low has been hit in
the Mines Bldg. . . . Artiﬁcial res-
piration was only needed once this
week to revive a victim of Dr.
Coull’s cigar smoke . . .

The Met. Seminar yesterday was
sadly depleted . . .-'Big ball game
with the I. E.’s, y’know . . .

toss a few character sketches your
way . . . For the ﬁrst sketch, I have
chosen a person whom I think em-
bodies the highest. ideals of this‘
University . . . one whose unusual
intelligence, . physical appearance,
and love life should be of interest
to all . . . His. name-—none other
than that jack-playing Romeo. of
the dept.,'Frank Pantano . ._ .
I have been collecting material
about him for months, and in "the
near future, I'll glean the choicest
tidbits from his dossier for a char-
acter sketch e5<traordinary—watch

either—can we now? heh . . . heh
. . . heh .

You all heard about that fa-\
mous hayride where the paddy
wagon picked up all the girls from
that Greenﬁeld church—Well, Bob
Titmus was there . . . They pick-
ed up his girl and his sister . . .
Think of it: Titmus contributing
to the delinquency of a minor . . .

Incidently at Sports Night
the other night, the C.E.’s let the
faculty beat them in a_ball game
. . . Just another way of polishing
the apple, don’tcha think?

John Myers asked Dr. Bishop if
the inside diameter of a pipe could
be larger than the outside diame-
ter of a pipe . . . Ah, we plumbers
are right in stride!!!!

DON’T FORGET THE ENGIN-
EERING AND MINES DANCE!!
Bill Leroy . . . Chatterbox . . .
$2.20 . . . Big Time . . . Don’t for-
get, you’re only "allowed to bring
one girl!!!

Former E.E., Howdy Masquiler,
was back in school the other day
. . _. He’s an ensign in Uncle Sam’s
Navy. _

The M.E.’s want‘ to play the
E.E.’s in football . . . The -Chem.
E.’s have a game scheduled with
Tech . . . Allow three minutes for
silent prayer . . .

If you want a laugh, call Ken
Vey up sometime . . . He sounds
exactly like Henry Aldrich.

Next week when I have more
time, I’ll teach you about the Short
Circuit Club and its President.

Until then, I’ll leave you with
your thoughts 2?

that Pittites need any. practice
but a local borough is in dire need
of help.) Future barristers and

orators got the ﬁrst workout of
the season when Men’s Debate
Squad met in the German room
this afternoon. I went home ex-

Wednesday—I guess it is i700

bull’s eyes at archery hour, but
really, girls, you should be more
careful of innocent pedestrians. Or
is it your idea to play Cupid? Tried
to crash the Panhel reception at

everyone that was anyone was go-

money to some use?

THURSDAY -— Supper call.
Awoke, dressed, washed, fell over
two chairs, spilt the bottle of

with it. If I get Passed by Dr.

Air Cadet Robert Amos, of the
‘newly arrived Squadron’ A, can be
found every Saturday night, and
particularly Sunday at the Canteen
with Arlene Schroth. Can this be a
new romance? -

Popular Gini Volkay is not com-
plaining of the man shortage, not
at all. Her phone is always busy-
but when asked if she would ﬁnd
time for one of our soldiers on cam-
pus, she said certainly, in fact she
hasn’t met one that she didn’t like.
The telephone number is Schenley
9035, boys.

The Age of Chivalry is not dead
—in fact it is looking up! Wes Piros
almost had his clothes torn from
his physique (am I kidding ?) trying
to keep the curious Chi O’s from
reading Harriet Bauer’s letter from
her one and only Douglas Charles
Harding. '

 at“ all times as good as they had to be and occasionally, par-

£7’-‘ _ Last week’s game was especially signiﬁcant_ in that the
 K-Panthers ﬁnally overcame their timity toward the ‘enemy goal
 ‘line. Indeed, in their previous games, it often seemed as though
the Panthers were under the impression that there wasa no-
trespassing sign erected on it. However, Clark Shaughnessy’s
_‘;9ft voiced statement that, “It’s the ﬁrst touchdown that's the
:hardest., Once you get that one, the rest come easy” indicates
that he at least knowshis own team. For the Pitts certainly

{ made their ﬁrst touchdown the hard way. ‘

Virginia fullback, Kenny Fryer (And the.Panthers should be
exceedingly glad that he was not twins) fumbled on his own
 latein the ﬁrst qluarter. Joe Pierre recovered for Pitt and
Bill Abromitis carried the ball through to the.18 on two suc-
cessiveﬁrst downs. Pitt lost a yard here and the ball was on

he 19 when the quarter ended. ‘ ‘

#3,?‘ “Cricket” Kalmanir, Pitt’s diminutive; 160 pound half-

back, opened the second quarter by carting the ball to the West
]Virginia 2 for a 17 yard gain. "On the next play Bill Abromitis

,;r,.

ad_van'ced it to the one-foot line.'That made it second down,‘
goal to go and it is doubtful whether at this point even Lloyd's
of;London would have given odds that Pitt would not score
"that touchdown. However, Joe Mocha on the next play faded
iback, apparently for a pass, and was promptly nailed by a
9-Mountaineer back on the four-yard line. That made it third
and ‘four. Johnny Itzel picked up two yards but it was fourth
 two. The West Virginia line was holding pretty well and
 now it was doubtful whether Lloyd's of London would have

« ' Quarterback Joe Kielb, who had replaced Joe Mocha,

called for a fullback line buck against a ﬁve man line. But West

Virginia suddenly shifted into a seven man line and the hole:

. But the nicest “plays” of that game did not take place on
.-the ﬁeld. One happened during the pep rally on the Friday‘
preceding the game. The other took place in the dressing room,
_ following the contest. And both concerned Center Ralph Ham-"
‘mond who was appointed captain for the game. It was at the
Pep Rally that Ralph announced that he wished to share the
‘captaincy with Marty Rosepink who had led the team against

.. If the Panthers were ever
in any danger of succumbing
to over-conﬁdence in tomor-
roW’s game with Illinois, they
might thank the University of
Wisconsin for sparing them that
fate. For Illinois, one of the major
“have-nots” of the current/college
football year, were not ﬁgured to
give the -game-by-game improving_
Panthers too much trouble.

The Illini had lost their ﬁrst
game to Camp Grant, they had lost"
th__eir second game to the Iowa Sea H
hawks, they had lost their third
game to Purdue, and they ‘were
duly ﬁgured to ‘lose their fourth
game to Wisconsin. However, the
ﬁnal score showed Illinois in front,
25-7.

 

So, despite their ﬁne showing
against West Virginia, the’ Pitts
are once again the underdogs. -And
the loss of ﬁrst string tackle, Marty
Rosepink does not ﬁgure to help
them any: Rosey,»who'left for the

sad admission that this did not

; the Doctor, “who had never caught
5 a basketball before in their lives.
" After practice we had thirteen who

'had,never caught a basketball be-

‘ fore in their lives.” He added ap-

timistically, “We’ll improve. After

i tomorrow we may have only twelve

to practice three days a week, Mon-

When Pitt’s touchdown trio "of
last Saturday, Joe Kielb, Tommy
Kalmanir, and Bill Abromitis,vwere
presented with a big cake with the
20-0 score suitably inscribed in ic-
ing last Monday evening, it was
merely the continuance of an old.
University custom. -

For Mrs. Alice (“Ma” to “her
boys”) Wilkers has seen to it in the
nine years that she has guarded
the diets of" the Pitt footballers,
that football victories were ‘prop-
erly celebrated on the Mondays
following the games.

Dinner is always special on those
Mondays after a game. But on the
Mondays following a victory, din-
ner is extra special with the boys
who scored the touchdowns receiv-
ing “the biggest cake my oven can
bake.”

?:EMonday at 1:30 P. M.

   

Of course, along with the cake

 

 

BILL ABROMITIS,

Pitt's three touchdoygn makers admire the cake presented to them Monday night at the Cafeteria

Seeing that Pitt Winners "Take the
Cal<e”’is OH Custom with 0"/Via" Wilkers

there is either chicken or turkey,
mounds of mashed potatoes, a fresh
vegetable, a salad and ice cream.

Perhaps the most “special” din-
ner of all was that which followed
Pitt's surprise 13-0 conquest of
Fordham in 1941. The boys had
turkey that night and. a cake with‘
candles. And the cafeteria women
saw to it that there were ﬂowers
on every table.

Mrs. Wilkers reports that over
a period of years she has found
that the favorite food of football
players is ice cream with chocolate
sauce.

But the interest in the football-
ers extends way beyond the table
for»Mrs. Wilkers and the women
who help her in the cafeteria. They
listen carefully to all the games and
some of them even pray for the
boys. -

28 Gridders In
Annapolis Party

Pitt is sending two teams into
action this weekend. The varsity
squad does not go into action until
tomorrow but the Panther “B"
squad will meet the Navy jayvees
at Annapolis today.

Twenty—seven members of the
Panther “B” squad left for Anna-
polis yesterday morning. They will
be coached by Stanley Olenn, who
played tackle for Pitt back in 1934.
Olenn, who has been helping out‘
with the football coaching chdres,
is co-director of the Army physical
training program here at Pitt.

For his starting lineup, Olenn
nominated guards William Grecco'
and Norman Edelman, tackles
VVarren Humes and Herb Shain-
berg, and ends Paul‘ Pioth and Robe
ert Ernst. At center will be Al
Beckman. Fullback for the “B’s?!
will be John Lozar. John Page;
will call the signals, and Bergig
Steytler and George Linelli from
flgelalbody will round out the back-

e .

The Pitt-Navy series, as carried
on by the freshman squadsof each
school in former years, .is one of
long standing. But Navy has usu.
ally been the victor.
however, Pitt spotted the heavily
favored Navy team a touchdown

early in the first quarter, but camg ‘ H
back to tie things up at 6-6, which ‘

was the ﬁnal score.

Playing for the Pitt freshman
team last year against Navy were,_

ends Walt Cummins and George“
DeBar, tackles John Saxon gm!
George Kohut, guards -Ed Davidek
and John Lutkowsky. Frank, No-
vak, who played some baseball, was
at center.; _ __¥
Roland Catarinella, considered
an especially ﬁne quarterback prop-
pect, called the signals. Lind Lamp"
was at__ full back and John Mario and-
flglenry Bennett completed the back‘-,
eld. '

Not one member of that prize‘
freshman squad of a year ago is in‘ E

school today. . —,
