Theodore W. Biddle, dean of
men and director of veteran per-
sonnel service has announced that
a total of 1300 new students will
be admitted» to the University for
the spring semester, which begins
in February. Of this total, eighty
per cent are expected to be vet-
erans.

Dean Biddle states that 6,000 in-
quiries have been received by the
University. Out of these, about
3,000 have or will involve formal
applications for admission. Of this
number 1300 will be approved for

admission. The undergraduate
schools quotas ar-e as follows:
School of Engineering——200k.
School of Bus. Ad.——200.
The College—300.
..Readmis»sion of advanced stu-
dents in good standing-600. '
In his announcement, Dean Bid-
dle stressed the fact that former"
Pitt students, who withdrew for
militar’y‘=servivce, and whose s-chol-f
astic records are .suﬁi~ciently high
deserve read-mission above all
other applicants. ‘This is the stat-i
ed -policy of the University Admis-
sions Committee. ‘
The announcement also disclos-
ed that the University will ad-
mit .students i.n June and Septem-
ber in numbers that are expected
to exceed all previous admissions.»

‘Wonder Whirl

Pitt men and women will be
oﬁicially in the campus swing on
Friday night. W-h-hy? Because of
the freshmen’s ‘Winter Wonder
Whirl in th-e main ballroom of the
“William Penn hotel. A semi-form-
al, the dance will be open to the
entire student body.

And to leave no doubt about
this self assertion, Joe Safyan,
publicity chairman says: “For
months there has been a cry for a
rfa-me,,_; band. Well, here it is—Lee
Castle‘. The turnout for this dance
will “determine whether Pitt will
get more nam-e bands or more lo-
cal bands for its dances. Now for
the first time in a long while, all
University people will have a
‘chance to dance to a big time
orchestra.” .

Lee‘ Cast1e’s orchestra, which
played for two years at the New
Yorker hotel ‘in New York, comes
to Pitt from the Meadowtbrook in
New Jersey. Castle directed Artie
Shaw’s band during the two years
Sha-w was in the Navy.

“We feel that this is a particu-
larlyfine opportunity for the vet-
erans who have just come to Pitt
to comerout and see what a Uni-
versity social -affair looks like,”
say co-chairmen Helen Rose Poole
and Steve Wolfson. They also

 

January 16, 1946

For the past few years we at
the University have been proud
of the wartime record of Pitt
men and women. It is a joy
now to see so many of them
back in the halls and Tuck
‘Shops, the classrooms and the
libraries. Their teachers are re-
porting a quality of work that
equals the service record. It is
good to have such students
with. us again. '

To you who are still in the
services, doing »a job that must
be done in this country and
overseas, we send greetings,
and we shall be glad when you
return. Write to your teachers
and your other friends here
and let them know where you
are and-' what" you are doing.
Your letters mean much.

Although the glory medals and oak leaf clusters are no
longer being freely distributed, our servicemen still have a vital
job to do. The job they are doing is to each of us a personal in-
surance policy against war, dissension, and economic chaos.

Occupation duty, as we should know, is not the gay trav—

Dave ‘ Hirsch,

elogue which recruiting posters picture and recruiting sergeants

describe. Though it can be educational, it is also dull and bor-
ing, the kind of duty that rusts men’s minds and warps their
'-souls. Yet, it is only our careful administration and rehabili-

"tation of occupied countries that will enable us to show them,
"once and for all, that the American way, our way, is the way
A most beneﬁcial to people everywhere.

3 -Of course there has been resentment in the occupied conn-

ltries but- we hope that it is only that type of resentment ‘whicvh

outsiders naturally incur everywhere and that it will gra,_dua»lly
simmer down into an adequate comprehension on the part of the

flittle people of those lands of just what we are trying to do.

Thus, we hope‘ they will see that our long-run goal is to show
them ‘the way to a new and better life, a life in which they and

i all other nations may share together in all the wonderful things
that modern’ science plus the tremendous natural resources of

the world itself, can and will produce.

Therefore, Pitt salutes its servicemen everywhere who are
carrying out this important task of occupation. We are proud
of these men and of the job they are doing, a job which is more
than" glorious, more than valorous- -It is a job whose treniendous
importance we are, as yet, unable to fully see; a job, the suc-
cess or failure of which will inﬂuence the course of world history

Dear Joe, 5"

Sorry it’s been so long since the
last ,letter——all my fault. How
are things with you? Long time,
no see, eh? It’s pretty easy to sit
at home and tell a guy like you
how to sweat out a boat home but
we’d like to try, because this Pitt
dealfis worth waiting for. Yessir,
things are looking up. The old
profs are returning, we’re getting
a couple of slices of meat on our

sandwiches in the Tuck Shop,
everything just like the old days.
Speaking of the Tuck Shop,

they’ve added what has hopefully
been. dubbed the Cocktail Lounge
to the Blue. Anyhow, whatever
else it is, it’s a right sizeable ad-
dition. (Now if they only arrange
to have some air pumped in.)
Yep, this place is big time again.
More dances than you can shake
your feet at——and still they come.
The freshmen have started in
where wartime seniors left off-—
got a big semi-formal cooked up
for"the William Penn with Lee
Castle and his Orchestra. My
friend MacGillievoy in a punny
modd calls it ‘Lee Castle and his
Drawbridge Gates.’ Okay, no more
of that. _You get the idea. Pitt is
again social. Why even the sorori-
ties "‘ are having open house for
vets. The T.P.A’s get credit for
originating the practice which w
hope is continued. 1
And listen, Joe, no matter what
you read in the papers, this school
is going to have a sports program
of which you can be proud. Don’t
think Shaughnessy is going to fsit
around and do nothing while be-
ing criticized in the local papers.
Irishmen don’t work that way.
Wait and see. Next year Pitt will
have a better than good football
team. Rumor has it that the ma-
jority of the ALL W.P.I.A.L. ﬁrst
team will ﬁnd its way to this up-
side down mine shaft. 
The deal for school going vets is
pretty good. Of‘ course you un-
derstand the workings of the G.I.
and Public 16 Acts. It’s better
than ever with the 15 dollar in-
crease effective January ﬁrst. One
word of caution, don’t plan on be-
ing able to live away from home
on your subsistence allowance un-
less you have some savings or
other means of income. Prices are

Radio Class Oﬂered

A beginning class in script writ-
ing for radio will be given at the
University during the spring sem-
ester starting February 11. It
will ‘be taught by Mrs. Victoria
Corey, radio executive, and will
be held Tuesday evenings start-
ing at 6:05. Students will be lim-
ited to 25. ’ '

not too high but are high enough
to make it tough to live on 75 a
month.

Right now at Pitt, we don’t have
an active Vet’s organization but a
little guy named Al Kaplan has
been chasing hither and yon work-
ing on remedying that condition.
So probably by the time you get
back a Vets association will be
operating.

Remember the ICG? You know,
Intercollegiate Conference on Gov-
ernment. Well, it’s back again
after being discontinued in 1942.
This year the convention in the
State Capitol will take the form of
a model congress to discuss such
things as strikes, conscription,
world peace—everything. Thirty
Pitt students will go. Maybe not
this year, but when you get back
this will be one place where you
will have the chance to put your
theories into practice . . and
see if they WILL work.

Oh, yes, the women. Somehow
I remembered that you might just
possibly be interested in that sub-
ject. Well, Joe, as I look around
me——and up and down——-pretty
good! (Get off my knee, honey.
have to ﬁnish this letter.) Scri-
nusly, as pretty a crop of loveli-
ness sleeps in classes here as

other schools. And they’re nice
kids, too. It was terriﬁc back
during the wartime shortage,

Right when the shortage of men
was at its worst, I wasn’t walking
a step around here. Had a sedan
chair handled by four beautiful
blondes.
Times have changed, alas and
alack.
Ah well, Joe, you get the idea.
Pitt is a good place to come home

to.

Sincerely,

Mac.

Letter To Editor

'(Editor’s Note: The following is
a reply to Jim Pettican’s editorial
entitled, “Give Them An Inch,”
which appeared in the News of
January 9. Other letters have been
received, including one from the
Pre-Social Work Club signed by
32 members. However, since this
issue is_to fu'rm7sh pr1'.m.arily news
of Pitt and its campus activities
which is of particular interest to
servicemen and women, we are
forced to curtail the amount of
space available for further discus-
sion of the above mentioned edi-
torial dealing with the strike sit-
uation. Th.erefore, we have select-
ed the _ following letter as a
representative sample of contra-
dictory opinion.)

'. :1: a:
Editor, the Pitt News
University of Pittsburgh

The * American workers are
striving, today to maintain the
standards which they were able
to attain for the first time enmass
during the war years. Labor is at-
tempting to achieve democracy-on
the labor front through labor's

(only trust—worthy weapon, the

union.

Mr. Pettican has claimed that
the workers -are being" led astray
by “power drunk rabble-rousers.”

The recent five to one strike vote

records in industry after industry‘
have shown that the overwhelm-
ing majority of American workers
are behind their chosen leaders.

It is_,_for the college youth of
the nation to realize that all peo-

ple are entitled to certain mini-,

mum standards just as much as
'1.hey.eh.ave the right to political de-
moor;-1cy.'No— one who has ever

seen the Hill District of Pitts- M

burgh or the Lawrence-Bloom-ﬁ—eld
districts would ever speak of
“o:ve_r.-pampered, ‘well-fed Amer-
ican '~labor.’_’

No, the time for smugness is
p,ast. We who have the good for-
tune to be able to attend college
must realize our social responsi-
bilities an-d support the reasonable
efforts of labor to attain the
_staridards of decency for them-
selvefsvand their families.

Survives Strife.
On Bataan

,There were two Pitt men on
Bataan when it fell to the J a~ps--
only one of them returned. He is
Major Joseph D. Kwiatkowski
who- was with the 60th Coast Ar-
tillery. His story can only be de-
scribed by the word nightmare.

On December 1, 1941, the Ma-
jor’s outﬁt took up their position
on Bataan and rem-ained alerted.
It was on December 8 that they
were told about the bombing of
Pearl Harbor. A week later the
Major’s crew ‘brought down three
planes with guns they had re-
ceived in August and had never
used before that day of ﬁring.
They tried to conserve ammuni-
tion, ammunition that was smug-
gled ineby an American submar-
ine. When Manilla fell, their food
supply was ‘cut off. The deaths
from disease and lack of food and
medicine‘ .were‘ so great they

couldn’t ‘bury the .dead.WThet~men-

felt.-th-“ere was no hopefor hold-

ing out. 1. .. s . 

On‘ the night that Bataan fell
the M-ajor’-s uniti(he- was the"n«’a>

captain) was ordered »-up to» stop ii”

the line of Japs advancing down
Luzon. His 2=0OLmen we‘re%prepa-r-
ing to go out as gueril-las when
they. were ordered to retreat to
Corregidor with -all «  _ equip--‘
ment. “They left under gunﬁre;
those who attempted to swim to
Corregidor were drowned in the
rip current. “It was another Dun-
kirk, only worse,” Major Kwiat-—
kowski said.

They held out on Corregidor un-
til May when they were ordered
to destroy all equipment——every-
thing from Ack-Ack guns to side-
arms. On May 6 the American
flag came down. The men of
Bataan had looked to that ﬂag as
a symbol of hope. When they saw
it coming down they cried. Aifterr
the white ﬂag of surrender was
run up the Japs came over and
strafed and bombed them, even
when they saw them destroying
their guns. On the morning of the
7th they surrendered to the Nips
who stripped them of everything,
even shoes. . V

Here began the Major's 3 years,
4 months, I day, and! 2 hours as a
Jap prisoner. At Cabana Tuan,
north -of Manilla, he was forced
to dig graves, cut wood, build
roads, and dig latrines. Sometimes
there was no food. When theyjgot
food it was wormy and when they
put it into their mouths it was
covered with ﬂies. “The ﬂies were
the size of P-38’s,”--he commented.

where a photographer took pic-

food, apples and oranges. But
when they went into the next
room the J aps took the food from

him. Arms -and legs had to be am-

While in camp the Major lost his
hair and went blind because of
malnutrition.

With ‘further American advances
he was moved to Roku Roshi in
the mountains on Honshu. He was
forced to hike up a steep hill in
the snow dressed in the summer
clothing he wore on Bataan. Men
who were paralyzed, or who had
only one leg were forced to make

70 men in one room.

On August 22, 1945, they were
told that the war had ended. Now
the J aps called’ them “dear Ameri-

Conference
Convenes

,7 The Intercollegiate Conference
on Government, discontinued dur-
ing the war, is resuming with plans
iior convening in ’ Harrisburg,

March 29-31.
M: ‘Tillie -Sanker was named pub-

licity director at a recent banquet
sponsored by the group. Philip
Rager, St. Vincent’s College, was
named the regional director.

2 Originally the ICG was organ-
ized in 1934 by Miss Genevieve
Blatt and John Bracken, for stu-
dents interested in government ac-
tivities. Representatives from the
schools participating were sent to
Harrisburg where they conducted
meetings each year modeled after
governmental functions. A few
of the activities modeled were: a
constitutional convention, -a poli-
tical campaign, and a state leg-
islature.

' This year the ICG will probably
meet as a model Congress. To
cionform with the idea, the dele-
‘ates to the convention will carry

n the duplication of the introduc-
ion, debates, and passage or veto
of current bills. All the political
situations that normally. occur
will be presented, complete to
lobbying’ and such procedures. No
ﬁaculty members. will be permitted
(in the ﬂoor of the forum, since the
students are to be. the only active
participants in the model Congress.

Spectators will be allowed in the ~
the

g-allies of the forum, where
Congress  _.u~.. gr... ~:..
Approximately 30 delegates are
expected to represent the univer-
sity, and total of approximately
45 schools? are attending.
Miss Ggenevieve Blatt, execu-

tive director, will meet with th--_,
:,. ' .'N;,

committeezrnembers in Harrisbu

next Wednesday, to reach a ﬁn 
decision regarding the model fo 5

the convention in March.
After the ﬁnal decision, if t
Congress is favored, preparati

from this beneﬁt, the Twelfth
Floor of the Cathedral of Learning
will be further on its road to com-
pletion. This should have import-
ant signiﬁcance for each woman at
Pitt, for the Twelfth Floor when
completed, will serve as her Uni-
versity home, and a place for her
participation in extra-curricular
activities.

“Cooperation of each woman
student at Pitt is necessary,” said
Nancy Graper, “for the Twelfth
Floor dream will materialize only
through the success of the beneﬁt.”

Miss Graper, beneﬁt chair-
man, heads the following commit-

tee chairmen:

Muriel Gusky, ticket committee;
Beatrice Rosenberg, ﬁnancial co-
ordinator; Beatrice Feldman, pro-
gram committee; Pat Eldridge, pa-
trons committee; Tillie Sanker,
publicity; Melrose Fleming, candy

Student committees,

obtained recognition for the Ben-

citizens of Pittsburgh about the
event. It is the hope of Tillie

committee, the students at Pitt
will help to spread interest among
their friends on campus and at
home.

We want you to meet our stalwart
staff

That is, if you can stand the gaff;

For they’ve got a lot—-in fact more
than suﬁice,

Of that stuff of which variety is
the spice!

If you’re ever on the eighth
ﬂoor blissfully hunting for the
Dean of Men’s oﬁice and you hap-
pen to stumble into a room where
all lbedlam h-as broken loose com-
plete with three minor riots in
every aisle, don’t Worry, par-tner,
you’re not dead yet, its just the
Pitt News Oﬂice.

That curly-headed Jack Bloom
is our business manager, (Gosh,
someone hadda take the job when
Whiteman ﬁnally left). Sitting, oh
so snugly beside him is Sylvia
“Tall Gal” Herzberg, who is whis-
pering softly to our exec’ that she
“just can’t find: that horrid old
ledger any place”. Across the aisle,
Lee l\/Iclnerney, campus editor,
screams frantically. “I.s there a
reporter in the house?”

In the adjoining oﬁce after re-
questing an appointment and com-
ing to attention as you enter, yo-u’1l
ﬁnd Betty “Slave-driver” Wolfe,
monarch of the inner sanctum. Big
he-mannish Russ Robinson is
trembling before her terrible
wrath as he says, “Gosh, Betty, I

for Christmas on -me, the old one’s

aghast!

At the far end of the main of-
fice is Tillie “I’m not really fat,
am I?” Sanker’-s desk. She runs
the feature desk, that is when she
can escape the amorous ardent ad-
vances of Merv “Its gotta ‘be cash
on the line” Stewart and Dave
“Sunrise Over Soho” Reis-berg.
Next to Sanker is our number one
scandal monger and rabble-rouser
Jim Pettican. Along one side of
the office y»ou’ll ﬁnd Margie “Em-
braiceable You” Torkler, our
make-up editor. At the copy desk
are Pearl “Didja put my name
in?” Weiner and Ted “Wh-at’s the
Scoop” Huminski.

Then, there is the sports desk,
where Larry “Banquet hound”
Bondy is the ‘boss, assisted by Al-
lan “Say don’t those downtown
papers louse things up “Roth and
Lowell “The trigger Stuck” Lulbic.
Surround all of this with a hurly
burly mass of people running
around sc-reaming various unprint-
able and incoherent things and
you have a bird-seye View of the
Pitt News Office. Of «course, no self
respecting bird would be caught
dead there, but then that's just a
ﬁgure of speech, or as one char-
acter said when he picked up our
little chronicle on a recent Wed-
nesd-ay morning, “Well, that is a

Housing Units
Will Provide
Relief for Vets

Recent government legislation
which authorizes 100,000 housing
units to be provided for the use of
veterans in municipalities and col-
leges promises possible relief for
the veteran student housing situa-
tion.

The University is requesting 500
housing units for the use of vet-
eran students. The request will

be submitted in conjunction with
that of the housing authority of
the city of Pittsburgh.

The legislation provides that, in
cases where veteran housing short-
ages exist, colleges or municipali-
ties may apply to the national gov-
ernment for pre-fabricated hous-

' ing units. The units will be avail-

able at government expense.

When the pre-fabricated hous-
ing units are obtained, they will
be erected on city property and
administered by city authorities
for the University.

As far as Pitt is concerned, the
primary housing problem exists in
the case of married veterans. So
far, the housing service operated

by the Dean of Men’s office has _

been able to provide housing for
most of the single men, veterans.
At present there are practically
no housing facilities for married

students available.

With the war Won and many of
their col-leagues back home as
honest-to-goodness civilians again,
Pitt servi-cemen on all fronts
c-ontinue to contribute their share
toward “winning the peace”.

According to dispatches from
Korea, PFC William s‘. Peterson,
honor student in the class of '44,
might possibly be accused of per-
forming his army duty the easy
way. Peterson has recently been
appointed director of the 30-room
Tanake house which is the resi-
dence of ﬁfty Red Cross girls,
nurses, and WAC officers. Heading
a 17-man native staff in the for-
mer Japanese general ofﬁcer’s
quarters, Peterson arranges for
everything from milady’s morning
toilet to manicuring the oriental
garden. He has ordered that all
shoes must come off when tread-
ing on the delicate floor mats, and
even has .M'P’s at the gates to s-ee
that the girls -get their beauty
sleep. V ‘Sorority mother, 2-Maitre
d’hotel, and Dorothy Dix all roll-
ed into. one, he thoroughly enjoys
his exclusive and attractive job.
His only worry is shooing off the
many candfidates volunteering to
be his replacement. Maybe, Sher-
man wasn’t exactly rig-ht at that!

PFC Robert M. Patchan, former
Pittite, is a laboratory“ technician
in-the Medical Unit at the 6th. Re-
placement Depot north of Manila
in-the Phillipines. A comparative-
ly recent arrival, PF,C Patchan
left the States on August 21, 1945.
Also, stationed near V-Manila, is
S/Sgt. Leonard Fivars who is at-
tached to the 29th Replacement
Depot. S/‘Sgt. Fivars participated
in the ﬁghting on New',',Calendonia
and Luzon and has earned two
battle stars, many campaign rib-
bons, and 85 discharge points dur-
ing his 31 ~months overseas.

University Highlights
Since Last Spring

Some vain commentator might‘
call this a resume of Pitt since
spring; Ma O’Leary would un-
doubtedly refer to it as Mulligan‘-,
but by any other name it would
still-—no matter. In effect, at least,
this is an inventory of Pitt's high-V
lights in the news since the last
Servicemen’s edition on April '18,
1945. _, ‘V

The highest of all our highlights
was «Spring _Festival. Little realiz,-.
ing that it was our last war-time
festival, Pitt climbed bravely -‘out
of its doldrums and various dusty
corners to ignore th.e rain and
witness the “Greatest Show. oh
Earth” with the lofty Comnion§
Room as a most elegant Big Top
for the Float Parade. At corona‘-
tion, Helen Hadgis was crowned
Queen of the Class of '45 whil__e
“John I. Whiteman” was being'in‘-
scribed in the permanance of ODK
walk. .‘
Later, our own Doc Carlson
made “News That’s Fit to Print."
Last spring with his survey, on
Fatigue he crashed the pages of
The New York Times.

With all this eulogizing there is
still room for the f'avorite or-
gan of Pittites’ gripes, The Pitt
News. The classiﬁed section, for
instance, just will not admit de-
feat. For years a notorious (or
is that “noteworthy”?) coffeeshop
has been advertising “There is no
key to our coffee shop,” and do
you think they’ve found it? Nope.
But they’re brave and hopeful.

This semester, after a summer
of well appreciated dawdling we
returned with our bottles of as-
pirin to register for the fall term.
And what do you think we found?
-MEN! The place is thick - with
them. The “Seventeens" were re-
placed with a ﬁne hothouse var-

iety of veterans, and the coeds’
theme song became “Happy Days
Are Here Again.”

Our Nationality Rooms now to-
tal seventeen since the comple-
tion of the Norwegian Room. Work
on it was discontinued when the
need for space was so great, and
with the departure of the Air
Corps and the greater part of the
ASTP the University was able to
ﬁnish it for the fall term.

One of the ﬁrst of the Army
surplus property allotment was
a Link Trainer acquired by Pitt
in connection with the new avia-
tion courses now being offered.

October was a great inonth. It
was hard to distinguish the
screams that emanated from al-
most any nook or cranny in the
building. No one knew whether
they were shrieks of mingled
pride, delight, surprise,. and hor-
ror at the identiﬁcati-on pictures
that were taken for the ﬁrst time

.-in three years, or screams of re-

lief and surprise at the “early”
appearance of the 1945 Owl.

Pitt’s history department un-
der Dr. John Oliver, was chosen
to write the Quartermaster Corps
History. A staff of ten is now do-
ing the work. .

An innovation in courses was
made this year at (Pitt. In order
to accommodate veterans, short
courses are being offered so that
they may begin their schoolwork
as soon as possible. The courses
are intensiﬁed eight week sessions.

Dr. Crumpton

Returns To Aid A

Dental Faculty

Dr. Robert I. Crumpton, ass_ist- ,1

ant professor of prosthesis, has re-
turned to the faculty of the School
of Dentistry following his dis-

charge from the Army as a lieu— I

tenant colonel.

Dr. Crumpton entered the serv-
ice July, 1942, with the rank of
major and served in the capacity‘

of Chief of the Dental Service of .

the 27th General Hospital unit,
known as the Pitt unit. "

Most of Dr. Crumpton’s t-ime

overseas, however, was spent in '

New Guinea where the unit was

located from July, 1944 to Au ust,

1945. “General conditions tj"ere
were bad.” said Dr. Crumpton,

“but they improved somewhat in

time.” He said that the two most,
striking characteristics of " the
country were the terriﬁc heat and’
the almost daily rains.

When the unit was ﬁrmly set-

tled in New Guinea, the dental ,

clinic examined men at an aver-
age rate of 2000 per month. Also
examined and treated were the
natives of the area, called “fuzzy-
wuzzys.”

To The Boys That Cheer

By Charles Bauer
Rain or shine, hot or cold, win or lose, the seven Panther
leaders utter a “never—say-die” spirit as -they

take their relative posi-

tions prior to each Pitt grid contest. 3 V
In the ’45 season, the “rah—rah” squad was composed of four
freshmen and three sophomores, which will insure a capable outﬁt
next fall. Of the seven, four served in similar capacity in high school.
Leading the Panther cheer leaders is Captain “Ike” Icardi, who

has given the squad the beneﬂte

of his years of cheering experi-
ence.

Soph Joseph A. Arena, Army
Air Corps vet, claims .four years
experience while at Central Cath-
olic High School. However this is
his first attempt at collegiate
cheering. Joe belongs to the Phi
Kappa fraternity; -

Activity minded Marshall Levy,
another sophomore, also shows

I considerable high school experi-

ence, which he gained at Taylor
Allderdice. ‘Levy belongs to the
Pi Lambda Phi frat, the Pitt News
staff and the Y.M.C.A.

Third soph on the squad is
Glenn Stuart, South I-Iill’s lumi-
nary, where he directed the Tun-
nelites’ yells for two seasons.

Glenn doubles as a member of the
Delta Tau Delta frat and the Owl
staff.

Jack Barilar, graduate of Punx-

art’s activities, as he too is a

Franklin Blackstone, alumnus of
West View High, doubles with his
voice as he is an ardent member
of the Glee Club in addition to the
cheering squad.

Freshman Jim Legnard reverses
the procedure he followed at St.

Carlson Enters Ba.sketball’s

‘Blue Book’ With Win

,No. 300

By George J. P. Kiseda

Dr. H. C. Carlson-—who invented basketball’s atomic energy, The Figure Eight--has taken over an-
other niche in the court sport’s Hall of Fame with his entrance into the exclusive “300 Club.”
When the voluble veteran’s Pitt passers pasted Carnegie Tech, 56-45, last Wednesday, Dr. Carlson

scraper U. into the record manu-
als. .

The number of college coaches
who can boast a like number of
conquests at one school probably
could be counted onthe right paw
of baseball’s illustrious Three--
Fingered Brown.

As a comparison, Ohio State’s H.
G. Olsen—-—like Carlson, serving his
twenty-fourth semester-annexed
his 250th success just this year.
Olsen, by the way, was awarded
the coaches’ trophy for 1945 as the
“man of the year.”

While compiling the 300 tri-
umphs, Dr. Carlson has been add-
ing links to his victory chain at
a rate of 66 per cent of the 453
games played. During his reign,
the Panthers have dropped but
153 games, a nominal ﬁgure when
the calibre of opposition is con-
sidered. . \

By far, the best year the win-
’em-all philosopher ever had was
the 1927-28 season. .

That year, with Chipper Charley

claim, the Jungle Cats thundered
unmolested through 21 straight
scraps to give Carlson his only
unbeaten campaign.

In the four seasons from 1927
through 1931, Pitt dropped but 11
decisions while taking 80. From
a statistical side, that constituted
Pitt’s “golden era” in basketball.

Pitt’s last taste of hardwood

headlines came at the end ofthe
1940-41 campaign when Carlson’s
ﬂoor ﬂock was invited to the
NCAA post—season tourney. The
Panthers traveled as far as the

scrawled Win No. 300 at Sky-4‘

eastern ﬁnals only to succumb to
the eventual titlist, Wisconsin, 36-
30. Earlier in, the year, Pitthad
whipped Wisconsin, 36-34.

limelight this year, it would not be
incongruous to ﬁnd Dr. H. C. Carl-

State. Both Pitt and State defeat-

ed Tech and both victories were

over different Tech coaches. The
Staters took the decision over
Max Hannum’s Tech passers

. whereas Pitt setback Red Silver-

man’s aggregation. The reason——
Max Hannum, for 15 years Tartan

lmentor, resigned several weeks
:ago and Silverman took over at

the helm.

Hannum is a Pitt graduate and
an OD_K brother of his‘ once keen
court rival, Dr. H. C. Carlson. Max
began opposing t=he doctor when
he was still a red head and now

‘the doctor is pure grey; possibly

Max stepped out before he too
changed colors. The former Tar-

tan coach never played college

basketball but gained his knowl-
edge in the Pitt fraternity league.

Stepping out of college Max
entered the Navy in World War 1
and upon discharge worked on the
Pittsburgh Press sports desk cov-
ering football. Tech then offer-

'ed Hannum the publi-city man-

agership and Max grabbed it up.
Two years later with the Plaid
minus a ﬂoor coach Max popped
into the picture again and was

asked to take over the reins tem-

porarily and that’-s just what he
did, for 15 years. He stayed, win-
ning two Eastern titles. .

Self Defense

Along with the petition to oust

Shaughnessy at Pitt was associat-

ed the name of a local sports cas-
ter, Bob Prince. Prince was linked
to this due to an association with
a local fraternity. Prince denies
having any connection with this
petition and said, “‘I was just as
surprised as anyone else when I
heard such a petition was being
circulated.”

Propaganda

A sport’s announcer who is
heard Monday through Saturday
at 6 o’clock over a local station
made a statement last week con-
cerning Pitt footballers and Clark
Shaughnessy. He stated that a
group of last year’s gridmen didn’t
plan to return to Pitt if ' Mr.
Shaughnessy was retained. -The
announcer based his information
on a secret poll taken amongst the
gridders. His so called secret poll
is so secret that the football play-
ers never heard of it.

The Pitt football men never
stated that they would not come
-back to Pitt if Clark Shaughnessy
returned: The grid-ders -aren’t con-
cerned with the coaching staﬁ but
with the poli-cy the University
adopts in- providing them with
tuition, job, and what else goes
with it. -

Pitt Tangles With Westminster

district basketball title on the line at Farrell Saturday in a clutch clash with their selected successor,

PiKA ’s-Phi Delis Await

Decision in

IF Race

By Herb Margolis
With Army repeating as the mythical champions in football and
all the bowl games completed, the only league remaining without a

championship team. is the IF Football League.

Contrary to a state-

ment made in this column several weeks ago, the PiKA’s have not

been officially awarded the cham-¢

pionship. If the Phi Delt protest

‘of their loss to the Phi Kapp’s is

upheld by Sam Heggie, chairman
of IF athletics at the time of the
dispute, the league will be thrown
into a two way tie for ﬁrst place.
The Phi Delt’s base their protest
on the fact that the Phi Kapp’s
used an ineligible man in their 6-2
victory. Should this decision be
reversed, a game between the
PiKA’s and Phi Delt’s would be-
come necessary to determine the
league champs. A previous game
played between these fraternities
resulted in a 12-12 deadlock.

The regular IF season had its
share of football thrills, but was
marred by a series of cancellations,
postponements, and forfeits due
mostly to poor weather conditions.
The Phi Ep’s, who won the title in
“44,” were eliminated early in the
season and it was evident from the
beginning that it was to be a three
team race with the PiKA’s, Phi
Kaps’p, and Phi Delt’s furnishing
each other the opposition.

The PiKA’s, pre-season favor-
ites, ﬁnished their eight game
schedule undefeated. Such vet-
erans as Johnny Gallagher, Johnny
Wood, “Doc” Lambert, and Bob
Dickey enabled them to ‘get away
to a fast start. i

The Phi Delt’s with several vet-
eran holdovers also showed’ power
throughout the season by winning
three games against no defeats.
Jack Douthett and Rafferty were
two factors for their _suc_cessful
season.

If not for their one defeat‘ at the
hands of, the PiKA’s, the Phi
Kapp’s would have given the
league its greatest surprise. Un-
able to ﬁeld a team in 19.44, the
Phi Kaps six came out ﬁghting
and came close to copping ﬁrst
place. "

Immediately f0].].O-}V]-.n&g the
semester vacation, Johnny Galla-
gher will post schedules for IF
basketball and bowling.

71%]. in 
samna

By Nate Prashker
Every afternoon about six
o’clock when the basketball-ers
are turning in for the night, you
can .spot a tall, quiet lad*,practic—
ing overtime. He is Sammy David,

 

an unassuming chap who hails
from Bridegville, Pennsylvania.

He played- his ﬁrst big time ball
at Bridzgevillue High when he
teamed up with Pat Malarkey and
lid lvlarazcwski to give Bridgeville
one of their most powerful of-
fensive aggregations. In his sen-
ior year Sammy starred -- as he
led Bridgeville all the way to
the quarter Fﬁnals in the
W.P.l'.A.L. tournament.

lstancling 6 foot 1 inch and
weighing 168 pounds, David is one
of -Carlson's most reliable board
men. His agility and skill at turn-
ing rebounds into scores were
quite a=ppa.rent in the Geneva,
Carnegie Tech and Penn ‘State
games. In all of these, though he
played only a little over two quar-
ters, David’s consistency went a
long way in determining theﬁnal
scores. '

At Pitt, Sammy is studyin.g pre-

¢Pitt.

Sporting a 6-2 chart ‘for the sea-
son, the tall Titans—gjiven little
chance in pre-season "estimates-
have ridden back into the district
picture on a four-garnge win streak
and the high-poweried;scoring of
Chet Dembinski. 6-3 freshman find
from New Kensington. ’

Dembinski’s hoop - hammering
accounted for 41 points in West-
minster’s last two struggles and
boosted him into second place
among the section’s scorers with
120 points in eight scraps.

Elsewhere on the  ﬁrst ﬁve,
Washabaugh has Chris Wagner,
sole holdover regular; 7gFred Paine,
6-6 guard; Don Heddieston, vet-
eran from the 1943 “quint; and
Dean Nelson, 62 sophomore.

Dr. H. C. Carlson’s’cagers will
follow up the Westminster tussle
with four return engagements be-
fore the second semester. Pitt will
seek its second sq vccess over
Geneva at the Stadium next Wed-
nesday and then Will square off
against its only conqueror, Ohio
State, on Jan. 30. 3

Despite the loss of All-American
Arnold Risen, who has turned pro,
the Buckeyes have moved into the
nation’s top ten with seven
stright triumphs. 

The Panthers willshgw at Penn
State on Feb. 2 and ‘at Carnegie
Tech on Feb. 6. ’

The new year 1946 marks a
grand and glorious era for the
fraternities here at Pitt. For the
first time since the start of the
war, the men’s fraternities are
beginning to rise.

The Phi Eps are getting seven
new brothers and in their honor
Friday night, January 11, had a
gala affair at South Park.

Phi Kaps are expecting 20 new
brothers from the past hell week
that- started January 8.

From Mel Hein comes word of
a formal, planned for February
on the invitation of the TPA’s, for
them, the Phi Gams and the Kap-
pas. The pledges of the Phi Gams
are holding a dance for the broth-
ers at their house. They are also
welcoming home seven brothers
who have just returned from the
services. -

Sigma Chi’s have turned out to
be bloodhounds lately They are
on the lookout for a house. So
maybe soon the fSig’s will have a
place to hang their -hats.

Pi Lams held their National
Convention. in the Essex House in
New York, commemorating their

‘Zeal 4ac¢4

50th anniversary. Starting the
New Year right the Pi La.m’s
initiated seven new brothers:
