Libraries

6- May Face Cutbacks

I at the state level,

BY TOM KUKUCKA

Hillman Library faces drastic
cutbacks if the budget crisis
continues, according to Glenora
Rossell, director of the University
libraries.

Rossell said cutbacks already
have occured in the purchase of
library equipment, such as ﬁling
cabinets and desks.

“Chancellor Posvar issued a
directive in August,” Rossell said,
“that no new equipment would be
ordered unless it was justiﬁed and
approved by the Administration.”

According to ﬁgures listed in the
University Budget and Financial
Expenditures, the proposed Univer-

sity budget exceeds $188 million,
565 million of which comes from
state appropriations. The proposed
budget for the library is almost $5.5
million including state aid monies.

Rossell said shorter hours or even
closure of the library would be
considered. Should the crisis
continue, Rossell indicated the
library is one of the first Pitt
facilities to cut back in a time of
ﬁnancial crisis.

‘ ‘You can not stop the library and
just turn it off,” she said. “It’s not
that kind of operation. Some of the
services you have to have every day.
For instance, we count on the
periodicals every single day.”

Mayor Makes Pledge
To Be A Pih‘ Lobbyist

By JIM GEFSKY
Pitt News Slaffwriter

Editor’s Note: This is the second
of three interviews with Pitts-
burgh's .Mayoral candidates.

Richard Callguiri, Pittsburgh’s
mayor since April, is running as an
independent.‘

QUESTION: What have you been
doing, and what could you continue
to do, to alleviate Pitt’s budget
crisis?

Caliguiri: I have no direct control
over the state budget, but since
about 25,000 students attend Pitt
and since it is one of our largest
employers, I have to resort to
indirect control, or pressure. I have
to be a lobbyist for Pitt, and make
my views known to Harrisburg. I
can also monitor the budget process
and talk to

' individual legislators and urge them

if

to make sure the universities have
a workable budget. The universities
should not be blamed if the state has

raise taxes to provide them with
funding.

Q: Do you favor Pitt’s continued
physical expansion in Oakland?

C: I've appropriated $100,000 to
a consultant to make the ﬁnal,
deﬁnitive study on the entire
Oakland area as a whole. This study
will provide the answers for not only
problems related to Pitt such as
building new dorms or new
classrooms, but for the business
community and the residential
sections as well. We can ﬁnd ways

His half-unpacked suitcase could

have. belonged to any businessman
passing through town. . Neatly
stacked white dress shirts, shaving
supplies and an unﬁnished novel on
the hotel nightstand soon would be
repacked.

Former television journalist Dan-
iel Schorr, crisscrossing the country
on. a promotional tour, stopped
brieﬂy in Pittsburgh this week to
attend Kaufinann’s “Book and
Author” dinner. Schorr’s new
book, “Clearing the Air,” focuses
on his stormy relationship with CBS
News after he released the
supressed U.S. House Intelligence
Committee Report to The Village
Voice.

No matter where they are, at
home or at work, Pitt
maintenance men find it hard
to escape the task of raking
leaves. Students have it a
little easier as they can put
off the chore by refusing to
go home on weekends.

On the other hand, students
participate in another
Autumn ritual—that of eating
candy apples. However,
many discover that candy
apples loosen silver fillings
and often necessitate a trip
home to visit the dentist.
And while they’re home,
maybe they’ll get to rake
some leaves...

Evangelista photo

‘ ‘There’s a piranha-like quality of
the public and the press, including
me, to pick on people, ’ ’ Schorr said.
“You get a certain pleasure seeing
the once-might brought down.”

According to Schorr, journalists
aren’t immune to this treatment.
“If you, as a journalist, become a
celebrity, then you are fair game,”
he said.

Schorr said he fears some
journalists enjoy their celebrity
status too much. “You pay for it.
Your can never approach a story
without having an effect on it,” he
said.

Schorr was dragged into the
limelight last year, when it was
discovered‘ he leaked a CIA
intelligence report deemed by

_ Congress as too explosive to

release.

Schorr now uses his broadcasting
expertise to manipulate the media,
which can either make or break his
new career as an author.

“I did lsevenltalk shows in New
York yesterday, and Im all talked
out,” he said. “But what is even
more distasteful is the way I’m
whisked from bookstore to book-
store autographing 20 or so copies
of the book, to be sold the next day
at an increased value. _

I’m learning a lot about
commerce and salesmanship, and it
isn’t pleasant. You’re stuck smiling
at a lot of strangers,” he said.

Schorr realized soirie people will
buy the book because of the

Task Force
Plans Trip
To Capital

By KAREN KADILAK
Pitt News Staff Writer

The Student Government Task
Force on the Budget Crisis will
make its second trip in three weeks
to the State Capital in Harrisburg
on_ Nov. 15 to discuss the current
ﬁnancial situation of state-related
schools with state legislators.

Task force members also decided
to organize into four new com-
mittees—publicity, special service,
group talks, and small work-
shops—in an attempt to get more
students interested in making the
trip to Harrisburg.

“We’re more optimistic about
this meeting than we were about
the last one,” committee member
Mark M_cKillopp stated. “We feel
we’re better organized.”

Kathy McCauley, who along with
McKillopp and Ed Bowers has
served as student coordinator of
the task force, said distribution of
campus—wide flyers, press
releases, and public service an-
nouncements will be made in the
next week to drum up student
support for the coming meeting,
with state legislators.

It was also proposed students
will be selected for student
workshops by their knowledge of

controversy surrounding his dis-
missal but adds, “I’ve got a good
story to tell.’’ -

Schorr leaned back on the hotel
room bed, his shoes off and his belt
buckle loosened. He covered his
already closed eyes as he recounted
the events leading up to the
publishing of the CIA report.

“I didn’t want any money or
royalties from the report. I started
looking around for a cause the
money could be donated to. That's
when the Reporters’ Committee for
Freedom of the Press was ﬁghting
First Amendment cases.”

Schorr donated all his royalties to
the committee.

Ntukogo Appeals
Tenure

Patricia Ntukogo, an assistant
black studies professor denied
tenure earlier this year, has started
the University’s appeals process.
Ntukogo’s University contract ex-
pires in April, 1978.

A ﬁve-member faculty appeals
panel has been chosen to examine
the Ntukogo case for procedural
errors. The panel can either conﬁrm
the decision to deny Ntukogo tenure
or suggest the case be carried to a
review committee.

Ntukogo contends that Faculty of
Arts and Sciences Dean Jerome
Rosenberg, in denying him tenure,

, ignored a favorable departmental

tenure recommendation and by-
passed procedures for a review
committee made up of members of
the University Senate’s Tenure
Council.

The review committee is required
by Senate by-laws only when a
department approves one of its
members for _tenure, and the
decision is overturned by the FAS
dean.

The black studies department
tenure committee voted 2-2, with
one abstention, in the Ntukogo
case. Department chairman Curtiss
Porter cast a positive vote for
Ntukogo, making the ﬁnal vote 3-2
in favor of tenure, but Curtiss is not
a tenured professor, raising ques-
tions as to his eligibility.

Greengard’s studies are relevant
to understanding biochemical
causes of mental disorders, such as
schizophrenia, depression and
psychotropic drug effects.

The Dickson Prizes, which carry
$10,000 honoraria, are awarded
annually to the foremost individual
or individuals in the United States in
both science and medicine.

Since the Prizes were established
in 1970, four of seven Dickson
recipients subsesquently have re-
ceived Nobel Prizes.

neurophysiology from Johns Hop-
kins University in 1953, and is a

rare situations, just the fact that
they’re young people. My job is to
try and ﬁnd a way to bring both
communities together, because
neither one can be eliminated.

Q: Do you have any thoughts as
to how security in the Oakland-Pitt
area can be improved?

C: Although Pitt has a large
police force of its own, I feel I can
help out by making members of my
police force more visible. More ane
more police ofﬁcers will be going
out on the beat to be used in
addition to the campus police force
to make the Oakland business and
campus communities safer for Pitt
students. I’ve instructed these
ofﬁcers to become acquainted with
the students on an individual basis,
so we can weed out the few
troublemakers and develop a
positive attitude about security in
the entire Oakland area.

Q: Is there any way you can
assure us of continued bus service
so as not to repeat last winter’s bus
strike?

C: No, it’s almost impossible for
me to say that I could since it’s a
county and not a city function.
Besides that, we simply don’t have
the necessary funding. I can,
however, interject both my views
and my services into any problems
that might arise, either with the
unions or with PAT, and try to make
sure that this doesn’t happen again.

Q: What job opportunities would
you create, so as to encourage Pitt
graduates to remain in Pittsburgh?

In Pittsburgh

(Continued from Page 1)

Schorr said he understands the
limitations of the industry.

‘‘I couldn't expect the public to
understand what my intensions
were. There are certain media

perceptions by which intentions get] y

misunderstood.”

Schorr mused about this prob-
lem. “You know, I was always on
the other side of that criticism-
people saying how television
doesn’t tell a straight story. But
it’s true, nobody understands.”

Schorr now has the chance to
inform the public about television’s
distortion, as he tours city after city.

‘ ‘I call my agent every day in New
York, and she keeps adding things
to my schedule,” he said.

The phone rang, bringing news of
the reviews that have .appeared
recently in Pittsburgh. Schorr
seemed pleased, but with only at‘_
hour until his dinner speech, he
needed time to rest.

It’s hard work being a news
maker, instead of a newscaster.

constitute a huge chunk of the
budget, would be most affected
should cutbacks be made. Hillman
Library employes 158 persons.

This fall has been the busiest
term for the library in the last ﬁve
years, Rossell said.

“We gave more tours in the
month of September than we gave
all fall term last year.”

Rossell expressed concern about

student apathy toward Pitt's budget _

woes, and believes the crisis cannot
be ignored and must be rectified by
the public.

“Too many people are taking this
whole situation for granted,”
Rossell said. “Each person should
get in touch with his or her
representative and urge them to
pass the budget.”

Rossell expressed hope that it will‘
not take a University shutdown to
awaken the public.

“I’m not sure what wouldbe the
proper shock therapy for our
citizens," she said. "I feel if we
closed our doors we would have a

“72 Years of Collegiate Journalism at the University of Pittsburgh‘f

A Bigger Stick

Pennsylvania’s state-related universities, which had kept a low
proﬁle during the first weeks (now months) of the state funding
ﬁasco, have made a warranted switch in ammunition.

‘ We, too, believed it was correct to be patient while the legislators
determined which way to fund the state’s institutions of higher
education. It was a difficult task in the beginning, and slicing the
non-preferred appropriations, which precluded a no-tax budget,
made matters worse.

We were convinced——or, at least, hopeful——the lawmakers had
the state’s best interests at heart, interests that probably did not
include a tax increase. But, like the universities, we’ve changed our
mind. '

It was easy to feel sorry for the legislators when we were sure Pitt
would receive its appropriation before snow fell.
funding in sight and the legislators home for an 11-day vacation,
the reluctance to raise taxes becomes a poor excuse. Any legislative
body that was working for its constituents would have passed the
universities’ appropriations package,‘and found a way to fund it,
before Nov. 1.

The universities view the situation as changed, also, since their
campaign has expanded to a point where it includes full-page
newspaper advertisements and, we suspect, several well-placed
phone calls from well-placed friends of the universities.

. In a statewide run of advertisements that do an excellent job of
treading softly while wielding. a large and mostly corporate stick, a
group of some 200 of the institutions’ more highly—placed friends
have issued a “declaration of common concern” that minces few
words in advising legislators that prompt resolution of the budget
problem is to be desired.

It is unfortunate this tactic, which will do little to ease the tension
in the capital, must be brﬁught to the battle. But little of what has
occured on Pennsylvania’s major campuses has impressed the
legislators, some of whom apparently are willing to have the
schools struggle into winter term without necessary funding.
Temple’s employes soon will be working for scrip. Financial
juggling at Pitt and Penn State has caused needless loss of many
thousands of dollars in interest foregone and paid. And the
legislators choose to take a vacation.

That is enough to move us to welcome any action that would

could have, the ends now justify the means.

Letters To The Editor

Posvar, Students, Missed the Boat

This letter addresses /itself to
Wesley Posvar, to those at The Pitt
News who control the ﬂow of
rhetoric intopour dear campus, and
to all members of the Student
Government Board. Ladies and
gentlemen—you blew it. '

While most of you comfortably
turned your attention to the battle
between the Pitt and Syracuse
football teams one Saturday, a
group of 14 students from Pitt and
CMU journeyed to Kent State to
take part in a more vital
confrontation. Dr. Posvar——while
you were cheering the blue and gold
on to victory, we were marching for
the forces of justice against the
atrocities practiced by our govern-
ment and the Kent State admin-
istration.

C’mon Dr. Posvar, Pitt News,
Student Govemment—be courage-
ous I challenge you to take a
deﬁnite public stand explaining
your position and views on the Kent
State issue.

Since you weren't there, permit
me to tell you whatl saw. I saw a
peaceful rally smashed by club-
swinging, tear gas-throwing mount-
ed police, who seemed to enjoy what
they were doing. I saw proof that
our Constitutional rights aren't
worth anything when they differ
from the view of a higher authority.
Dr. Posvar, I saw a colleague of

yours, Mr. Golding, ignore the.

lessons learned from the 1960's and
attempt to violently crush a peaceful
rally of concerned human beings.

Human beings who were willing to

give up Saturday football games in ”a'

order to speak up for justice. Learn
the true facts and take a stand. Four
students were murdered in 1970 at
Kent State. There very easily could
have been a repeat performance
this past Saturday. Does this bother
you? It scares the hell out of me.

Dr. Posvar, show us that you’re
not just another pompous stooge
appointed by a few rich friends. Pitt
News, fulfill your journalistic
obligation and tell the students the
real story. Student Government,
take a strong political ,stand for
once. Considering your past
performances, I doubt that any
action will come forth. '

‘ ‘reverse discrimination. ’ ’

This: week another example of
this conservative movement sur-
faced at hearings on the Public
Employees Relations Act 195, held
in Harrisburg.

Act 195 governs the rights of all
public employees (excluding ﬁre-
men and policemen) to unionize,
bargain collectively and strike.

But House Minority Leader
Robert Butera Tuesday urged a ban
against public employee strikes that
he voted to legalize just seven years
ago.

This change in Butera’s attitude can
be seen as a manifestation of a much
larger change in attitude among the

‘ people in the state, and among the

people across the country.

Butera, the only announced
Republican candidate for governor
in 1978, proposed an overhaul of Act
195, and he acknowledged his
reversal of support.

He said the two-fold aim of the
law was to resolve the problems of
underpaid government employees
and eliminate illegal strikes by
teachers and other public servants.

“The law has not eliminated
strikes,” Butera said. “It merely

has made them legal, and it has
made Pennsylvania one of the most
generous employers on the face of
the earth.”

In place of public employee
strikes, Butera said_ he would
supplant a requirement for “final

offer” arbitration as a last resort
when contract negotiations break
down.

Final offer arbitration is a process
an outside party, the arbitrator uses
to determine what he feels is a fair
contract. The arbitrator examines
the ﬁnal offers of both sides,
management and labor, and
decides which is more just. This
process is legally binding, meaning
both parties must accept the
arbitrator’s package.

This form of arbitration differs
from binding arbitration because
arbitrator does not have to accept an
offer from one side in total, rather a
compromise package, made up with
a little of both sides.

Either form of arbitration is
optional, but must be agreed upon
by both sides before an arbitrator
can be selected.

There is nothing inherently
wrong with strikes or other forms of
work. stoppage. Strikes can be
harmful, though , depending on the
sector in which they occur. Police
and ﬁre protection personnel,
obviously, should not be able to
strike. The right to strike should
not belong to prison guards or
mental hospital security personnel
either. Any public employees
involved in the care or control of
certain potentially dangerous in-
dividuals should be prohibited from
striking.

There are no valid reasons why
teachers should be prohibited from

7
striking, and the same applies for
welfare workers, social workers and
others in similar occupations.
As Al Fondy, president of the

4

Pittsburgh Federation of Teachers;-ll.

said, “teacher strikes don't affect
the safety and health’ ’ of the public,
“and should be allowed to
continue.”.

Fondy also opposes forced
binding arbitration, and he is right
in is opposition. Binding arbitration
should be an option when
negotiations break down, but
should not be imposed by law.

Fondy said, “Ifimposed by law, a
binding arbitrator must have the
authority to raise taxes to make
settlement payments.”
a good idea.

There is no substitute for a
union's right to strike when it comes
down to the negotiating table.

Butera’s candidacy for the
governorship in 1978 may be a
reason why he has changed his
mind. on the right of public
employees to strike. He'll need all
the support he can muster,
considering he is a Republican. But
he may be making a big mistake by
alienating the public work force.
With Pennsylvania’s huge bureau-
cracy, the number of people he
betrayed by his testimony Tuesday
is very large. Butera might have
good political reasons for position
change, but the fact remains he is
wrong.

That is notﬂrap

Page 6-—THE PITT NEWS—-Friday, November 4, 1977

By DAN McKAY

The debate over the morality of
abortions in the United States has
mushroomed since the Supreme
Court, in the 1973 case of Roe vs.
Wade, made abortion legal for the
ﬁrst time in the history of the
nation. People have usually been
aware of their own personal
convictions regarding the issue, but
only since legalization has the lid on
this’ topic been opened.

The debate often boils down to
whether the reproductive system
falls under the jurisdiction of the
female or the fetus. Ifthe former is
true, abortion can be justiﬁed as one
of three choices a woman with a
problem pregnancy should have. If
the latter viewpoint is true, the’
government must step in to act on
behalf of the defenseless fetus by
enacting strong anti-abortion laws.

Another way to reach the crux of
the question is to decide when life
begins. Although the Supreme
Court has consistently sidestepped
this sensitive issue, pro-life groups
are much less in doubt.

People Concerned for the Unborn
Child, a non-sectarian, non-proﬁt,
non-partisan pro-life group, stated,
‘ ‘We believe that human life begins
at fertilization (union of sperm and
egg)...that the child in the womb is
a human being even in the earliest
stages of development and has a
right to birth and continued life
according to sound moral, legal,
medical and social traditions...”

Catholics For A Free Choice, a
religious group that opposes the
Church’s oﬁicial decree against
abortion, stated, “We believeit is
‘an individual woman's right to
make decisions regarding abortion
and mntraception in accordance
with her own conscience without
fear of criminal prosecution. We
oppose any efforts to deny the right
of conscience through constitutional
amendment, or Federal and state

— legislation. Any interference by the

state is a gross and unconscienable
invasion of personal privacy and a
direct violation of a female person’s
human civil right to responsibly
control her own reproduction.”
Interestingly enough, another
paper distributed by People Con-
cerned for the Unborn Child views
women's abortion rights as another
male sexist tool. “Abortion Exploits
Women” by Dr. Gloria V.
Heffeman states, “The strange
compulsion for abortions is in
reality the ultimate exploitation of
women by immature men: techno-

crats, generally, imbued with a
myopic sense of social awareness
and unable to interpret or control
their own sexuality.”

Mary Winter, vice president of
the Pittsburgh Chapter of People
Concerned for the Unborn Child,
believes, “Pre-born babies are the
most discriminated minority in the
United States.”

The word “fetus”, she asserted,
is used as a “dehumanizing word,
like ‘nigger.’ ” Winters concludes,
‘ ‘The pro-life movement is truly the
liberal position.”

Jeanne Clark, clinic co-ordinator
for Allegheny Women’s Center,
reveals a different view: “It’s very
apparent they (the pro-life groups)
are right wing”. She explained the
Constitutional amendment support-
ed by Winter’s group would include
the unrelated issues of permitting
capital punishment, prohibiting

3 Abortion: Recognizing Th

gun control and ﬁnancing parochial
schools. -

Groups opposing abortions in
general are certain to oppose
government ﬁnancing of abortions
for welfare recipients. Winter
claims her objection is demonstrat-
ed, like consciencous objectors
during the Vietnam War, by
withholding a certain percentage of
her taxes. She realizes the cost of
extra food stamps and obstetric care
for an unwanted pregnancy would
far exceed the cost of an abortion,‘
but her concern is moral, not
ﬁnancial.

The most recent decision by the
Supreme Court held states need not
ﬁnance abortions for those receiv-
ing Medical Assistance. Clark, also
a member of the National Organiza-
tion of Women (NOW), feels, “it
was forcing motherhood on poor
women.” Clark pointed out that the

eMoraIAspect i 

poor are usually the poorest-risk
mothers and the ones least
accessible to contraceptives.

Virginia Andary, executive direc-
tor of the Washington, D.C.-based
Catholics For A Free Choice,
believes, “That’s an issue of
discrimination.” Surprisingly, she
notes that, ‘ ‘Of the people who give
their religion (on abortion clinic
forms), roughly one-third are
Catholic.”

Sometimes, cases of rape and
incest are exceptions in the
arguments of pro-life groups, but
not by People Concerned for the
Unborn Child. Winter claims that
only one percent of such victims are
impregnated. That one percent, she
believes, should still carry and
deliver her child because, “at least
she's dealt with a horrible thing in a
positive way.” ~

Believing it to be a private
matter, Winter says “We have no
policy on contraception,” but the
agency opposes the use of
“morning after ” pills and inter
uterine devices because they work
immediately after conception.

Birthright, an agency that
Winters and six others founded
“really for tax reasons,” is not the
only non-abortion counseling agen-
cy available, she noted. Besides
Birthright, there are Lifeline, Zoar
Home (for unwed pregnant wo-
men), Catholic Social Service of
Allegheny County and Alternatives
to Abortion.

“Women are under the.impres-
sion that going for an abortion is like
getting a manicure, and they’re not
told how it can affect future
babies.” Winters said.

amassed a record of S9-17-S, never

Pitt vs. WVU -- A Bitter Rivalry  

embarrased in this big battle. Far from it. To the contrary,
the Mountaineers made a most favorable impression.
Johnny Majors would have loved to drub Pitt’s most hated
rival, but he never got the opportunity.”

The wildest game in the series took place at West Virginia
in 1965. Garrett Ford, now an assistant at WVU, rushed for
192 yards and three scores while Mountie quarterback Allen
McCune passed for ﬁve touchdowns. Pitt’s attack was
paced by the passing of Kenny Lucas and the running of Eric
Crabtree. The Mountaineers rolled up 624 total yards in
edging the Panthers by the score of 63-48.

Dave Hart’s initial victory as Pitt’s coach came in 1966
when the Cats rallied from a 14-0 deﬁcit to win, 17-14, on a
last period two-yard plunge by Joe Jones, not to be confused
withTurkey Jones of Cleveland Browns. One of Hart's
assistant coaches at Pitt that year was Frank Cigietti, now
the head coach at West Virginia.

The Mountaineers ran up and down the ﬁeld against Pitt
the next year, but were unable to score a TD. They had to
settle for ﬁve ﬁeld goals from Pittsburgh native Kenn
Juskovich to beat Pitt. 15-0.

WVU won the next two years, which brings us to the
famous 1970 Pitt Homecoming game. Ed Williams scored a
trio of touchdownsin the ﬁrst half to give WVU a seemingly
untouchable 35-8 lead at the half. So gloomy did Pitt’s
comeback chances appear, even superfan Tiger Paul left at
that point. He should have stuck around.

Mysteriously, Pitt’s defense stopped WVU cold, while the
Panthers’ offense calmly drove for four touchdowns, led by
quarterback Dave Havern and running backs Rony
Esposito, Dave Garnett and Denny Ferris. Havern’s pass to
tight end Bill Pilconis with 55 seconds left in the game gave
Pitt a stunning 36-35 upset win. Pitt Coach Carl DePasqua
called it the most fantastic comeback he’ d ever seen in all his
year of coaching.

West Virginia attained sweet revenge in 1971 when Pitt
quarterbacks Haver, John Hogan and Bob Medwid were

"intercepted four times. WVU 20, Pitt 9.

Pitt’s football program went completely south after that
until Johnny Majors and Tony Dorsett were brought to the
rescue in 1973. Pitt bused to Morgantown with a record of
1-2-1.

According to Morgantown Dominion Post’s writer Bruce
Hampson, Pitt shouldn't have wasted its time coming down
to play the 3-1 Mountaineers. The October 13, 1973

Mountaineer Football Special served up the following
morsels: “Some say the Mountaineers by 7 and others say
Pitt might as well stay home. ..If the weatherman predicting
showers is correct, Pitt’s ﬁne freshman halfback Tony
Dorsett will make a big splash in his debut before WVU fans.
But the rains may hold back until this evening, and Pitt
coach Johnny Majors may be forced to drown himself in a
water cup instead of a sideline puddle.”

Pitt “drowned” the Mountaineers rather easily, 35-7.
Dorsett splashed through the perspiration-drenched
Mountaineer defenders for 150 yards and three TD’s
including and electrifying 35-yard burst down the right
sideline in the third quarter to give Pitt a 21-7 lead.

The ecstatic Pitt players kept Majors’ head well above the
drowning level giving him a victory ride on their shoulders
after the game.

A 31-14 Pitt victory in 1974 only made the Mountaineers? ,5,
hungry for revenge once again. The 1975 game will never be‘
forgotten by Pitt or West Virginia loyalists. After a scoreless
ﬁrst half at wild Mountaineer Field, WVU scored the game's
ﬁrst touchdown on a fourth and goal run by Ron Lee, now
with the Baltimore Colts. Pitt answered with a sensational
27-yard touchdown pass from Matt Cavanaugh to Gordon
Jones deep in the end zone. WVU took the lead again on a
dramatic run up the middle by Artie Oawens, who plays for
the San Diego Chargers.

Pitt came back once again, this time when Cavanaugh hit
Dorsett for a nine-yard scoring play. The Mountaineers
appeared to be driving for the ﬁnal score late in the game,
but Pitt’s Tom Perko recovered Lee's fumble at the Pitt 14.
Pitt decided to try to play for the tie, but WVU regained
possession at midﬁeld after a punt by Larry Swider. A pass
to WVU’s Randy Swinson gave the Mountaineers the ball on
Pitt’s 22 with three seconds left. Walk-on kicker Bill V
McKenzie calmly booted a 38-yard ﬁelc] goal as time ran out‘, _

It isn’t necessary to describe the 17-14 victory celebration.

Perhaps this game lit the ﬁre under many Pitt fans, causing

them to become almost as wrapped up in the game as those
from West Virginia.

Oh yes. If you’re at the game Saturday, don’t be
surprised to hear “Beat The Hell Out Of Pitt” during the
solemn silence between notes of the national anthem. And if
you hear one frantic voice scream “36-35" as a rebuttal, all

- you need do is check the byline of this story to find the
culprit’s name.

  
  
   
    
   
  

Wondering if the Pitt Hockey
Club will have a successful season
is like wondering if the sun will rise
each morning. It's inevitable.

So Panther coach Len Barcalow
wasn’t sticking his neck out the
other day when he predicted the
1977-78 campaign would not be any
different. The Panthers open their
schedule tomorrow on home ice
against Bowling Green University,
and Barcalow is anything but
pessimistic.

“We’re going to have a good,
strong-skating club,” he said.
“We’ll do all right—after all,
these guys really know how to play
the game."

Barcalow has the same thoughts
prior to each season, and has yet to
be proven wrong. In his four years
as the Panthers’ head man, he has

experiencing a losing season.

Last year, Pitt ended the season
with a 12-5-1 slate, another
successful effort that Barcalow
attributed mostly to weed pulling.

“We got rid of a couple of bad
apples after that Penn State
game,” Barcalow said. “We were
an entirely different club after we
got that thing straightened out."

Barcalow was referring to an
incident after an early-season
contest at University Park, which
resulted in the suspension of
former captain Rick Vernon and
teammate Scott Kimmick.

“They’re suspended
indeﬁnitely,” Barcalow explained
at the time, “and I don’t remember
dates too well.”

Barcalow’s decision, backed by
faculty advisor Harvey Wolfe,
forced the Panthers to play without
the services of Vernon, Pitt’s

The Pitt Hockey Club, seen in action here against the Philadelphia Junior
Flyers, opens its 1977-78 season against Bowling Green tomorrow at the Lake

Vue arena.

Kimmick, who was no slouch

himself. Many doubted if the team .

could function without the duo but,
true to the Barcalow tradition, the
team emerged a winner.

Barcalow liked what he saw in
his revitalized team——“nobody
tried to be the hero and nobody
yelled and screamed at each
other”—and most of that squad
will return for another go-round
this year.

The Stein brothers, Rick and
Bob, with backup help from Bob
Arturo and Alex Sangrilli, will
strive to tighten a defense that
allowed an average of 3.77 goals
per game last year.

While nearly four goals a game
couldn’t be considered extraor-
dinary, the performance of the
offense could be. Led by Bill
Gredeon’s 55 total points, Curt
Hetz’s 52 and Tom Sherwin’s
contribution of 50, the Panthers
responded with a powderkeg of
nearly six tallies per game.

Barcalow’s ﬁrst of two ‘ ‘number-
one” lines, as he called them last
year, will consist of Hetz, who,
along with his 23 assists, was Pitt’s
leading goal-getter with 29; Larry
Gallick (six and 14) and Dave
Elson, who was a late entry to last
year’s club and collected eight
goals and 15 assists.

Sherwin (25 and 25), Gedeon (18
and 36) and Tim Duffy (10 and 11)
round out the Panthers’ second
“number-one" trio, while the line
of Mark Doeﬂer, Russ Marks and
Alex Sanchioli also is expected to
see plenty of game action.

Barcalow also has two number-
one goaltenders in Larry Newell,
who ended last year’s efforts with a
4.01 goals-against average, and
newcomer Rich Cunningham, who
has played in Quebec. Barcalow

Panthers Face
Polo Playoffs

By BOB LABRIOLA

Pitt News Staff Writer

The Pitt water polo team begins
its “second season” this weekend,
traveling to West Point to compete
in the Mid-Atlantic Conference
championships.

Pitt, Army, Bucknell and Cornell
will compete in this round-robin
tournament, whose results will be
used to determine the seedings for
next week's Eastern Champion-
ships. Bucknell, which has not lost
a match to the Panthers this year,
finished ﬁrst in the conference after
the regular season—followed by
Army, Pitt and Cornell.

With the exception of Dave Diaz,
who is out for the year with a broken
wrist, the Panthers will make the
trip free of nagging injuries. Team
morale is also at a season high, with
attitude and personal problems in
the past.

“Ithink Pitt is going to surprise a
lot of people, -both in the
Mid-Atlantics and the Easterns,”
Slippery Rock coach Richard
Hunkler said. “The difference
between the team now and the one
that lost to Bucknell in the Pitt
Invitational is that Pitt now is
playing as a unit. It has coordinated
its moves both offensively and
defensively, and has become a
closeknit squad."

Pitt has been impressive of late,
ﬁnallly adapting to the system

installed by coach Miguel Rivera.
On offense, Pitt will work the ball to
the man in the hole (similar to the
slot in hockey), and will set picks for
the wings, who will drive t 
goal. The only problem with thi .-
type of offense occurs when the
ofﬁcials allow the defense to hold,
which disrupts the pattern and
causes turnovers. A

“All the tournaments we play in
from now on will have Class A
referees,” Rivera said, “and they
understand our style of play. If the
defense doesn't keep their hands
above the water, fouls will be called.

It will be like taking candy from a
babyf’

The Panthers will go back to f"
man-to-man pressure defense in‘ at.
effort to create as many turnovers as’
possible. Pitt will use its zone
defense when it has a big lead or
ﬁnds itself in foul trouble. The
starting lineup is not yet deﬁnite,
but speculation is the Panthers will
put their six highest scorers in the
water to add as much ﬁre power as
possilbe.

The general feeling is that this
team can be as good as they want to
be; the only way that the Panthers
will lose is if they beat themselves.

“I guess you could say we have
something to prove,” Rivif. 
continued. “The players know tha ”‘
if we win now, our names will go
down in the record books——but if we
lose. we will sink into obscurity.”

Meisner Another Pitt Super Su

By KAREN KADILAK
Pitt News Staff Writer

When Jackie Sherrill was asked
at Tuesday’s weekly football press
luncheon, to assess the handful of
freshmen who started in Pitt's 48-0
victory over Tulane Saturday at Pitt
Stadium, the name the Panther
head coach blurted out was Greg
Meisner.

“Meisner looked very, very
impressive,” Sherrill told local
media representatives at the
luncheon.

Very rarely do coaches go to such
extremes when praising their
ﬁrst-year players. Then again, it’s

not very often freshmen playiithee

way Meisner did, while ﬁlling in for
the injured Hugh Green at left
defensive end against Tulane.

Meisner (six tackles and one
quarterback sack) was all over the
field Saturday.

“Greg had a good game,” Pitt
defensive coordinator Jimmy John-
son said. “He did an excellent job
rushing the passer and chasing the
ball.”

Perhaps the truest barometer of
Meisner’s performance that he had
no missed assignments, a rarity for
a freshman starting his ﬁrst game.
Steve» Fedell, who started at the
other defensive ﬂank for Dave
DiCiccio in the injury-depleted
Panther defensive lineup Saturday,
lined up on the wrong side of the

ﬁeld while starting his first game

against Syracuse two weeks ago.
“I think I did a lot of good

things,” Meisner said. ‘‘I didn't

have one busted assignment. Of
course, there’s always room for
improvement. I think I have to
improve on my bass drops and learn
how to contain better on pass plays.

“Overall, I really was pleased
with the way things went Satur-
day,” the freshman from New
Kensington continued.

Although Green, who’s been
bothered for several games with a
torn ligament in his right ankle, will
start tomorrow against West
Virginia at Morgantown, Meisner is
doing his homework for the game.

‘ ‘They run a lot of counter plays, ’ ’
Meisner said. “We’1l have to be
prepared to stop them.”

“They run about 10 to 15 counter

tor Johnson added.

A not so good piece of news for
Pitt fans—West Virginia scored its
two touchdowns in the much-publi-
cized 17-14 upset of the Panthers
two years ago at Morgantown with
that play. ‘

Come tomorrow, if those counter
plays work as they did then,
Sherrill may blurt out a word or two
stronger than Greg Meisner’s
name.

Freshman Greg Meisner is another of Coach Jackie Sherrlll’s outstanding
reserves, doing a fine job in filling in it r Hugh Green in Pitt's 48-0 victory ‘over

Boaters Lose Bid

By JEFF DUROSKO

Penn State proved to be too much
for the Pitt booters Tuesday night,
as the Panthers fell, 5-l. Pitt played ‘
tough, but it was “only a matter of
time” before Penn State’s great
offensive pressure put the Panthers
away.

The Nittanies mounted a 3-0
‘nalf-time lead the Panthers just
couldn’t overcome. Pitt played
State for over 19 minutes before the
Lions scored, and all three ﬁrst-half
goals came within seven minutes of
each other.

“We played well enough to win
some games, but not a tough team

like Penn State,” said Pitt coach Leo J

Bemis. “Their ﬁrst goal came off a
throw in and it just broke our backs.
We let down.”

One high note of the game _was
Marty Moyer’s goal—- the
scored against the Lions on their
home turf this year.

The loss, the second in a row for
Pitt, ends all hopes of an NCAA
playoff big and dropped its record to
6-6-1.

Goalie Frank Bucci was “pretty
well beat up", after the rough
contest. Test for possible kidney
injury were conducted but proved
negative. Bucci should be in goal

BOWLING GREEN, 0 .——Out-
standing performances by seniors
Mel Boyd and Dave McDonald
helped the Panther cross country
team ﬁnish ﬁfth at the Central
Collegiate championships last Sat-
urday. ’

Of the 80 runners ﬁnishing the
race, Boyd placed second to
Michigan’s Bill Donakowski. His
time of 24:19 was close to that of
McDonald, who was fourth at 24:27.

“This was deﬁnitely the best

' ‘competition we’ve faced all year,”

said McDonald. “I think many of us
must have run about 4:40 for the
first mile, so it shows we started out
fast enough.”

Last season at Central Colleg-
iates, McDonald and Boyd were
23rd and ﬁfth. As a team, Pitt was

Assistant coach Dan Sullivan
pointed out the squad failed to run
as a pack, a factor that allowed
Bowling Green and Western
Michigan to beat out Pitt for third
places behind Michigan and Penn
State.

“Although there has been

/itprovement in closing the time
‘a

p between our ﬁrst and ﬁfth
men’s splits,” Sullivan explained,
“we should cut off about 30 more
seconds in order to ﬁnish as we
should.”

For example, Michigan, whose
runners were ﬁrst, 12th, 13th, 14th
and 15th enjoyed the advantages of
well-executed pack running and
won the team title with 55 points.

For Gary Siriano, who placed 40th
(25:38), his ﬁrst collegiate cham-
pionship race was “kind of
disappointing. ’ ’

“I took it easy around the middle
of the race and had way too much

What can you do with only a bachelor’s degree?

Now there is a way to bridge the gap between an
undergraduate education and a challenging, responsible
career. The Lawyer’s Assistant is able to do work tradi-
tionally done by lawyers.

Three months of intensive training can give you the
skills——the courses are taught by lawyers. You choose
one of the seven courses offered—choose the city in
which you want to work.

Since 1970, The Institute for Paralegal Training has
placed more than 2,000 graduates in law firms, banks.
and corporations in over 80 cities.

If you are a senior of high academic standing and are
interested in a career as a Lawyer’s Assistant, we’d like
to meet you.

played their best game of the year

After the WVU game, the
Panthers will travel to Indiana (Pa.)
on Tuesday to close ou the season.
No matter what they do in each of

of 10 (which they have already
quadrupled). Soccer is improving at
