Eicperts Carried
Away by Plans;
Left, Out Pipes

The noted architects and en-
gineers who laid out the plans
for the Cathedral were evidently
carried away by the architectural
aspects of their projects.

So intent were they on making
sure that they threw in enough
flying , buttresses, that "they for-
got to make allowance for some
necessary equipment namely
heating pipes.

It was not until the building
was well on its way to comple-
tion and the ceilings and floors
were laid that someone made the
awful discovery.

Since it was boo late to in-
corporate the pipes in the walls,
the only thing to. do was drill
holes through". the ceilings and
floors of the forgotten rooms and
install the pipes.

cadets have obtained Charlie Spivak
and his orchestra.

The dance committee headed by
James Lauble has extended invi--
tations to the dance to Governor
James H". Duff and Mayor David L.
Lawrence. - '

While the dance is sponsored by
the Pitt corps of ROTC cadets, it
is open to all students. Tuxedo or

Several extras have been obtained
for the Ball. Free parking and

to all attending the dance. Special

we’d better start all over again.

rawing a Line

 Just as a line must be and is being drawn on Communism to-
day, a limit should be determined as to how far a person can go
in laying on the public record the lives and actions of those who,
merely on the basis of their affiliations, are then "black-balled”
by our occasion-ally-gullible society.

This does not condone Communism or its many fronts. But it
‘does criticize incautious methods of the press and other agencies
of public information. The ayerage citizen has careless reading
and listening habits, and, if given the opportunity, will associate,
A no matter how accurate the story, single names with a group when
“no evidence is presented to establish soundly such a connection.
Exposed Communists have no kick coming, but the utmost discre-
tion should be exercised to prevent unjust implications of persons

Pitt's Dr. Marion Ha.thway was victimized by just such a lack
of discretion on the part of a downtown paper and, in following
7 p the story, by the News. She has in her possession documented
‘proof - a letter from Congressman John S. Wood, chairman of the
House Un-American, Activities committee -- which states that at
‘no time in the course of public hearings of the committee was her
«name mentioned either by or in a question asked of Matthewq.Cve-
tic, the FBI man who worked inside the Pittsburgh Communist

’ However, a Pittsburgh paper stated otherwise. From that ori-
gin subsequent stories have carried the same inaccurate informa-
tion.‘ In the course, the reputation of Dr.i,Hathwa'y has suffered.
Dr. Hathway has been associated with the Progressive party.
She confirms visits of a social nature to the Polish consulate,‘
where persons of all the extremes of political thought have ap-
peared in the past.JTo~tag a Red label on her or any other person
merely on the basis of such affiliations would be a gross mistake.
It‘s an established fact that many a person has joined what he
thought was a. liberal organization only to find its function act-
ually was or trended toward the Communist doctrines. Discovering
these things, most such persons quickly withdraw from the organi-
;zations. And it’s happened that a truly liberal body is infiltrated,
Vandhas its purposes twisted by the often very capable Communist
organizers. Again we see considerable ship jumping. Yet such
persons would be done infinite harm by irresponsible handling by

V The persistent assault on Dr. Hathway by Judge Blair F. Gun-
ther of the County Court seems to fall along similar lines. His
latest‘ broadside insisted, pointing to the social Work professor,
that universities should remove from the faculty any person con-
nected with Red/-tinged organizationsfor face the loss of state

While he doubtless has his own convictions on the matter_,
iv Judge Gunther can reasonably be suspected, as’ Robert X.-Graham
and other faculty members, of using this as a furtherance of his
political ambitions. And his attack, which certainly taints Dr.

,Hathway’s reputation, publicly reveals such slim evidence that
he, as a judge, would have to throw out of court a case with as

Nonetheless, we must insist on our right and
lishing the ‘Friday story. Who ever heard of a newspaper that
:doesn’t report a political speech, no matter what the paper’s in-
, dividual leanings editorially are? "Even Henry Wallace’s campaign
for President under the Progressive party banner, which had vir-
tually no backers among the nation's newspapers, was accorded
considerable space in the public ‘print. "If we recall our training
in Mr. Graham's journalism department, we were taught this. "If not,

L L For the University to take any action against anyone on the
basis of political leanings and public attack, it must have aicon-
rete case. A powerful precedent will be set, if the school moves
or removes. The seriousness of any situation involving Communism

for its taints has to be recognized. But, to come too close to the
line would do irreparable damage to the work of many high-prin-
pcipled persons undeserving of any such attack.

reason for pub-

,department heads should have in-

By BILL SCRIVO “

Pitt News News Editor

0verset

i

I’m afraid that theldepartments
of this University don’t get into
the spirit ofthe subjects they teach.
When the Cathedral was built the

sisted that their sanctums be con-
structed along lines that would
transport students into .the realm
of the study they were pursuing.
It’s not too late to change to the
following set-up, if the department
heads get on the ball. A ,
The geology department will be
considered first and foremost. The
perfect setting for ‘the rockpickers
would be a simulated cave, built
with specimens of all the rocks in
the world incorporated in its walls.
The head of the departmentcould
set a fine example for his under-
lings and students by wearing a
bearskin sarong and toting a small"
pick-mattock at all times.

Better Setting

This would furnish a much better
setting for potential geologists
than plaster walls and suited in-
structors talking about the pleisto-
cene period.

Of course the coal geologists
would have to wear miners’ hats
and get union cards.

Each office of the modern lan-
guages should be decorated in the
style of the country of the instruc-
tor who resides there. The instruc-
tors would dress in the fashion of
their country and speak o‘nly the
language they teach.

The journalism department would
be laid out on the style of the city
room of a daily newspaper. The
University could hire people to go
around shouting andin general make
the required noises.

Of course the history department
should be required to get in charac-
ter by having ‘its rooms decorated
in the period architecture which is

 

being taught in the class. Profes-
sors would daily dress in the habit
of the decade s they planned to lec-
ture on.

The School of Pharmacy should
be built along the lines of a large
drugstore. The -innovation of a
large soda fountain would doubtless
intrigue the inmates. Pharmacy
freshmen would serve ’em up and
do the little chores like refilling
bottles and typing labels.

ROTC -in Barracks)

ROTC men would take classes
in .a large barracks-like room
and be required to eat chow in the
cafeteria (that’s already in charac-
ter.) They would salute atall times
and be required to sleep with their
rifles if they missed class. This
last provision is subject to the
dean of women’s approval as rifles
are sometimes called “she.’

For Music appreciation students
haircuts would be taboo; instead of
books they could carry music scores
and batons.

Life in the political science de-
partment will take on a different
aspect. Only instructors with liar-
vard accents will be hired. The in-
cumbents will have to cultivate
said accents and also buy brief-

cases and possibly homburgs.

It will also be applauded if they
grow Acheson style mustaches.

So much for this. Heads of other
departments can figure out what can
be done to enhance the atmosphere
of their departments and start work
immediately.

Miscellany,

The backstage crew at the Players’
Thursday production almost fainted
in a body. The stage was strewn
with gobs of hair and they thought
someone hadlosthis head. It wasn't
so, though. Casca’s robe was just
shedding -its fur collar.

Incidentally, since Caesar was
reported to be a good show, I am
liable to toast the Players in Tuck
Shop coffee. .

However, since a popular campus
professor proposed a boycott on
Tuck Shop coffee and I signed the
pledge, I regret that lam unableto
do so.

Speaking of Tuck Shops, they
are always so crowded one would
think that students there are engaged
in intellectual debate. According.
to one four year man, the only thing
learned in the shops is to "put a
napkin under your coffee cup so it
doesn’t drip when you pick it up.”

The Fourth Reich

 

If we should soon get tired of
Communist scare stories, it'll be
easy to turn back to the institution
of the Fourth Riech, now being
planned at Pitt.

The Gestapo has been organized,
secret service men assigned their

posts, and soon those not quite
human beings, the freshmen, will
be trained to conformity to be
better recognized as the inferior
beings they are.

The Dink Edict will be enforced!

Just thought I'd let you know the
Cavalc an te-Buc han an picture reached
all the way to Tampa—via the Asso-
ciated Press.

I have been getting the latest
on the football situation up there at
the campus (which looks good), but
not much of the personal items. 

As far as I know the newly-
wedded couple were strangers to me
when I spent my senior year at Pitt

«.«-r-‘zlast year,but saw them occasionally

in the halls doing what they are.
doing in the picture.

Just struck me funny to pick up
the paper on Sunday in the apartment
and discover such a familiar sight.

Of course, it had to appear in the
rival paper.

Council eager beavers, or allowed
to sit all together in a special
13

iblock at football games.

But Men’s Council,in planning to
enforce dinks with every method
short of greyhounds, might bene-
fit from an objective look at their
program.

They plan to cpntact freshmen
through their classes, and on dis-
covering dinkless violators of the
sacred law, refer them to Upper-

class Court. 

Now, far be it from this column-
ist to deny the dink its charm and
personality.

Few are the upperclassmen who
do not feel asurge of school spirit,
tinged with superiority for no longer
being a freshman, _when they see a
dink-spotted campus.

As a tradition (after the fresh-
man year) some students boast of
the things they did as freshmen,
and a souvenir dink, on a study wall
is nice to have. There's a certain
prestige when among non-students
in having one.

But is it disloyal to feel that
freshmen are individuals with a
right to decide for themselves
whether or not they wear a dink?

The indulgently coddled theory
that college means education may
be smiled at, but when attending
class without a dink means dis-
closure to that awful body, Upper-
class Court, peals of laughter
may be heard from the top-most
peak of the Cathedral of Learninﬁ

All students taking part in the
road tour have been officially ex-
cused from attending conflicting
classes through the office of the
dean of men.

Played to Full Tlouse

The Players gave four perform-
ances last weekend, to full houses
for both the Friday afternoon mat-
inee and on Saturday evening. There
were near capacity audiences for
the other two shows. »

A reception was held Thursday
night in Stephen Foster social
room for the first night audience,
at which members of Players and
the cast performed an impromptu
skit burlesquing the production.

“Julius Caesar” is the third of
Pitt Players productions to be given

/during the 1949-50 season. They
will complete the year’s program
with a Broadway musical, "Conn-
ecticut Yankee,” which will be

The jurist couched his charges
on visits Dr. Hathway made toithe
Polish consulate, stating the trips
were made in the interest of Red-
tinted causes. Dr. Hathway, how-
ever, asserts that she was merely

attending social functions at the
consulate “as were many other
Pittsburghers.”

Judge Gunther first attacked Dr.
Hathway last year for alleged Red-
front activities. At that time, a
group of her students stood up for
her, stating she was “an unusually
qualified and objective instructor
who has never at any time inter-
jected any partisan

viewpoints
into her teachings.” v

Effect of Emotional Quirks

The emotionally maladjusted per-
son maybe giving a literal descrip-
tion of his condition when he says
that lie is "sick at heart.”

Dr. Ralph N. Zaberenko, instruc-
tor in psychiatry, claims that such
“organ language” is often quite ac-
curate in describing the effects of
"emotional disturbances” on or-
gans ofthe body, such as the heart.

Lists Causes

The Pitt psychiatrist attributed
symptoms of heart trouble in many
cases to emotional disturbances in
a lecture at the Western Psychiatric
Institute Wednesday evening.

Emotional disturbances some-
times develop symptoms of heart
trouble which “may lastfor years,”
he said.

Dr. Zarbarenko mentioned high
blood pressure as one of the un-
solved diseases in the field of
psychosomatic medicine. He indi-
cated that this widespread malady
"seems to be closely tied in with
emotional disorders.”

“Lack of Love” Cited

“Lack ofparental love and care”
is a common factor in the back-
ground of hypertension cases, he
said. The feelings of helplessness
and insecurity that occur due to
thwarted desires for dependence
give rise to tension states, de-
pression, and “chronic, almost
constant, rage.”
/ “The hypertensive finds it im-
possible to express hostile im-
pulses,” the psychiatrist said.

 

By JOAN SCHEWE

Fortune telling is a handy pas-
time. This is whatAlbert Hirsch has
to {say about his hobby, palrﬁ reading.

The amateur seer, a sophomore
in the College has read some 175
fortunes in his year and a half on
the Ellsworth and Cathedral cam-
puses.

A far cry from wandering gypsies,
Hirsch previews coming events at a
table in the Commons Room. After
over an hour of palm reading one
day, he quipped, “This is beginning
to get out of hand.”

Hirsch, a naturalized citizen who
emigrated from Munich in 1941, is a
short, dark-haired fellow with a
lively interest in people. With his
good humor and easy wit he has a
faculty for winning them into his con-
fidence.

As. for his own fortune, Hirsch
reveals some rather, paradoxical
facts. His palm exposes him. It says
he doesn’t always tell the truth.

The soothsayer confirms this
reading. "I admit I’m a fake,” he
says,‘ “but I like to see peoples’
psychological reactions.”

He adds that, according to his
hand, his temperament is unsuitable
for the teaching profession. Hirsch,
however, is defying fate. He plans
to teach mathematics.

Queried as to how he acquired his
reading habits, the Crafton lleights
resident maintained that it was
a spur-of-the-moment decision. He
walked into 9. store and “bought a
book for five cents.” The initial
impulse then lead to a full fledged

‘ hobby.

tive society.”

lecturer will visit Pittsburgh during
the week of March 26.

the city, one of which is the Social
Science Association at Pitt.

Miss Terre has a long list of ser-

war. One of them was Commanding
officer of the Free French ‘X/AC5.

She will speak to many groups in ,_

known to disappear at night, so.
rules are very strictly enforced.
There are bells attached to the

doors, and every person in the build-
ing after ll p.m. without a pass is
in danger of being tossed out.

Why Janitors GetTG}ray

According to Bill, fraternity boys
often try to get in the Cathedral.
One night a group of boys carrying
three trophies, asked Bill if they
could leave the cups in the Commons
Room. He wouldn’t let them, gather-
ing that they were taken from a
rival fraternity house.

During the war when there were
3000 GI’s stationed’ in the Cathe-
dral, it was hard for any of the
workers to get around the build-
ing. Every time one of them would
have to identify himself. Bill used
to get “awful disgusted” at these
"eager kids.“

But primarily Bill’s "people”
are there to give the buildings a
good thorough scrubbing.

The quarterback is
’ the T.

And like any other cat, the Jungle
Cat of Pitt hopes that he will have
nine lives. These nine lives at the
present time, consist of nine aspi-
rants for the quarterback slot.

Whether any of these nine will go
down in football history, or whether

' each will bring only a gasp remains
to be seen.

If any of this group can master the
T to suit Len Casanova, then one of
the “overwhelming” problems that
face him will be eliminated.

Five ‘Looking Good’
Of the nine aspirants, Casanova
pointed out five who have been
‘‘4* “looking good,” during the first
week of drills. Last Thursday mar-
_ked the first outdoor workout of the
squad, and Casanova had a chance
to look over Bob Osterhout, Bill
Doziski, Fred Botti, Frank
Guadagnino, and Bob Be-stwick.

Osterhout is a left-hander who
has had some experience with the
T during a brief stay in the Navy.
The remainderhave all been exposed
slightly to the system, either in high
school or on the practice field last
year. _

The other four boys who are keep-
ing Casanova interested are Armand
DiFonso, JimJennings, Joe Schmidt,
and Joe Kurtik. The latter three are
all from last year’s freshman team.

New Faces
Blank Faces

By MYRON KOPELMAN
Sports Editor

 

If there are any hairs left in
not gray yet, they can rest easy.

 
  
  

Ralph Mitterling’s head that are
They won’t fade this year.

Old Sarge does not mind telling you that he ishappy about his
‘ Pitt baseball team this year. "We’ll be at least as good, if not

better, than last year's club,” says
he.

And last‘ season’s record of 11
and eight was not half bad, either.
Compared to most Panther seasons,
it was downright glorious. But that
shows the trend of the times here
where baseballis rapidly picking up.

The Very fact that Mitterling is
optimistic about the future proves
that he cannot be classed with the
present day crying-towel coaches.
Sarge could, if he wished, present
plenty of plausible reasons for
grumbling.

Let’s Suppose

Suppose the rookies or subs titutes
are defeated at every position
which a holdover regular is after.
The lineup would still show four.
new faces.

It would read like this:

First Base, New Man; Second
Base, New Man; Third Base, New
Man.

Shortstop, Steve Pavlakovic or
Bill Ford. (Pavlakovic, a third
I sacker, has been matched by Mit-
terling against Ford in a battle for
the shortstop job, thus posting a
“Vacancy” Sign on one more posi-

  
 
   
 
  
   
  
    
  
   
  
  
   
  
   
   
  
  

 

tion.) _
Leftfield, Buzzy Matthews; Cen-
terfield, Bhbby Lewis; Rightfield,
New Man.

Pitchers, Rudy Hudec and Larry
Brent; Catcher, George Matich or
]_oe Risacher.

Now the big question is, "Who
will the new men be?” The club
has not had enough outdoor work
yet to give observers much of a
line on the comers. And if Mitter-
> ling has any private notions as to
who will be breakinginto his lineup,
the Stadium will cave in before he’ll
make them public.

Sarge has always gone by the
theory that to plug one boy in pre-
season practice is to discourage an-
other. Consequently, at this time
it is necessary to call a work stop-
page on the prediction line.

   
  
    
  
  
   
 
 
   
    
  
   
   
  
  
  
    
 
  
      
  
 
 

Mittmen
In Shape

Ralph Mitterling’s mittmen are
making hay without the benefit of
sunshine.

In spite ofthe absence of a broil-
ing sun, the baseballers are in
playing condition. Mitterling said,
“If necessary, the boys can go to-
morrow. They’re in playing shape
now. Of course, the pitchers would
not go/the distance.”

The thin man of the squad is
Buzzy Matthews, who lost 20
pounds since practice began a
month ago.Matthews,a regular out-
fielder last year, leads a pack of
Panthers around the track every
night after regular practice hours. »

The once rolypoly leftfielder
started “the mile-a-night club” for
hisown good when he first reported.
Now he says he gets knocked down
in the rush to the track.

Another “haymaker” is Pitcher
 Larry Brent. The lean right hander
claimed, “The club, myself in-
cluded,is in bettershape now than
it was last year at this time.It
should show in our playing.”

Dukes Seek
Oakland IM
Cage Toga

Should history repeat, Pitts
all-campus Quint, the Dazzling
Dukes, will find the going easy
in their bid for the all-Oakland
title Thursday on the Stadium
Pavilion.Last seasons Pitt entry,
the Phys Ed Whips, rode home on a
52-34 victory Over Tech’s Frosh
Architect quint on Tartan hardwood.

The Dukes compare favorably in
every department with «the Phys
Ed Whips.’ Andy Brinsko and John
Lesko supply the aggressive punch
that the Whips were noted to have
had. Ronald Weinstein, Pitt's ex-
JV standout, may sway the scales
in the Dukes favor when compari-
sons are made with the Whips.

Center Andy Moranz, who is a
pivot shot artist, is the play-maker
Of the Duke squad.

Emanons rall

Tech’s representative in the all-
Oakland bill, the Emanons, no name
spelled backwards, are the athletic
powerhouse of the Tartan campus.

The-Emanons, who are certain of
copping the Tech all-point intra-
mural trophy this season, defeated
the Architects Friday night during
the Tech annual Intramural Night
festivities. Offense is the key word
of the Emanon attack.

Pete Katsafanas, a Tech varsity
passer last year, does a good job in
controlling the backboards for the
plaid champs. Height willbe against
the Dukes as Katsafana (6-4) and
Bill Wild (6-3) outreach Moranz, the
6-2 center of the Dukes squad.

Field Shortage

Meanwhile, the coming softball
season is_ again bringing forth the .
old " C°m1'ﬂ8 in ona prayer” song.
Intramural Director Leo C. Bemis
was fortunate to have gotten through
football with the Schenley Oval
turf and limited use of Trees Field.

However, Pitt's baseball team
along with ‘Duquesne University's
football squad will make good use
of the Oval green. Bubbles Field
is for the neighborhood youngsters,
and both Ellsworth and Trees Field
willbe used by the Pitt footballers.

Split inancing System
Adfvocated by

Educator

"ly GEORGE BARWOUR
Public education must be financed by a modern, efficient sys-
tem shared by all levels of government, Dr. Walter D. Cocking,
professor of education at New York University, said at the fifth
session ofthe School Board Institute at the University last Thurs-

day.

No level of government should
bear the entire responsibility of
financing" the program because the
local, state, and national govern-
ments all receive benefits from
the educational system, he de-
clared. He addressed over 200
local school directors at the meet-
ing sponsored by the University

   
   

 

DR. WALTER D. COCKING
Equal /lid Needed

and the Tri-State Area School
Study council.

Control’ of the program should be
retained in the community, he added.

School, Community Related
“There is‘ a positive relation
between the school and the commun-
ity. Educational problems should
be determined at this level be-
cause the state and national govern-
ments are too remote from the people
and not too familiar with their

local problems,” he explained.
‘-‘The progress of the school is

the outgrowth of public demands.
In fact, there are only a very few
areas of the institutional program
and areas of service which the
public school renders which have
come from professional educators,”
he reported.

Better Leadership

"The schools need better leader-
ship, but we cannot get it with the
money we are now paying out for
education,” he stated.

"A good school administrator
is worth more to the community than
a motion picture executive. Yet

the movie tycoon is paid about
ten times more than the school
administrator receives,” he ex-
plained.

"Teachers are the blood stream
of the school. But good teachers
cannot be secured at a salary be-
tween $2500.and $3000 a year.

Need Equipment

"New tools, buildings,“ equip-
ment, and supplies are needed. But
apparently the people think that
here is one industry that doesn’t
need tools,” he said. b

He compared public financing of
education with payment for medical
services. "When we hire a surgeon,
the more money we pay out, the
better services we obtain,” he
said. "The same is true of the
schools. We can not expect to have
better schools unless local, state,
and national government jointly
pay the price for a well-rounded,
inclusive educational program.”

Church Bus

Service Set

A free bus service has been
started for Pitt students living in
the Oakland district who wish to
attend the Sixth United Presbyterian
church _at' the corner of N. Highland

month at Carnegie Union, Miss
Roberts proposed the plan to Al-
fred Payne, executive secretary of
the YMCA, Lester Brailey, assis-
tant dean of men, and adelegation

Students Should Know More

On Communism, Says Cvetic

~ ~ College students need to know more about Communism, says Matt

Cvetic, the FBI agent who bated the internal organization of the Pitts-
burgh Communist party in a startling if

Pointing out that some 30 Com-
munist doctrine on the Pitt campus
prior to his recent testimony before
the House Un-American Activities
committee, Cvetic emphasized the
need for knowing‘ more, not shun-
ning, a knowledge of Communism.

No Match for l‘.e,d
“I’d like to impress upon the
students that they should acquaint
themselves with the facts of Com-
munism. Most college students
could not hold their own for five

minutes in a debate with a Com-
munist,” the FBI informant states.
"You've got a big job to do

out there.”

IIe’d like to help with that lob

, and said he would welcome the op-

portunity to address the student
body, if he is invited to Pitt.

Not Snuffed Out

Cvetic indicates that his head-
lined expose has not snuffed out
the campus Communist activity,
but will not state at the present
time names and scope of theV‘cur-
rent activity here.

He explains that the earlier
Communists, whose names were a
part of his Washington testimony,
belonged to the Labor Youth league,
not a Red-front organization but
an actual wing of the Communist
party.

Cvetic himself once’Worked as
a propaganda agent at Carnegie
Tech. That was before -he was ele-
vated to higher Red circles and,
of course, before he broke into
the open with his revelations.

Drilling ROTC Squads 
Coming Spring 

B)’ ELIZABETH KNOX

  

One of the surest signs of spring, at least around the Cathe-
dral, is the sight of squads and columns of uniformed students
executing various phases of close order drill out on Heinz Chapel

lawn.

To the student at Pitt this is a familiar scene. He saw it two i

hours a week last fall from the be-
ginning of the semester to the and.
Of October. If he thinks about it at
all, he knows that he will watch it
again in the spring. "Yeah,” he
might tell you. “It’s the ROTC
boys paradin’ around; we like to
give ’em a hardtime.” This is said
as he saunters over to join a group
of hecklers standing within vocal
range of the march__'in'g cadets.

Yes, he knows . that they're
“ROTC boys.” He probably knows
that those initials mean Reserve
Officers’ Training Corps; maybe
he’s read about one fo their hono-
rary organizations, Prop and Wing,
or he may have heard someone in
the Trick Shop mention the other,
Scabbard and Blade. What else does
he know? If he’s an average stu-
dent, his knowledge stops about
there.

What do you know about Pitt’s
ROTC?

Do you know, for instance, that
each advanced cadet is paid 90
cents for every hour of military in-
struction he takes? Have you heard
that those uniforms are paid for by
an allotment which the University
receives from the government?--that
each cadet who receives a Distin-
guished Military Graduate award

may immediately enter the Air Force a

or the Army as a commissioned
officer? I

In 1949 thedivision was made at
Pitt between the Army and the Air
ROTC. The former is composed of
the Quartermaster, Engineer, and
Coast Artillery Corps. (This last
division, however, will be discon-
tinued after June.) Administration
and Comptroller sections are the
twoiparts of the Air Force.

An attempt is made to correlate
the cadet’s special  With his
major, if possible. For example,

an engineering student, naturally, "I

is assigned to the Engineer Corps;
a business administration major
may be placed in the Quartermlaster

Corps or the Air force Comptroller V I

division.

Qualified Air Force and Army
officers instruct the cadets, and ‘a
West Point graduate, Colonel John
I. Hincke, is director of Military
Science at the University.

The non-veteran student I who
passes physical and mental exami-
nations may schedule the basic
C0urS€- This one credit course
which meets three times a week
does not entitle him to a pay check,
nor may he keep his green uniform.

Life takes on a more rosy hue
for the cadet when he enters the
advanced course in his third year.
He is paid! This thrym credit course
which meets five tiines per week
also is open to veterans who hav_e
served at least twelve months in
the armed service. This group may
keep its uniforms after graduation.
Uniforms of the Air ROTC are in
the process oftransformation to the
new powder blue and can be seen
about the Cathedral on first year
advanced cadets.

It won’t be necessary, though,
to wait until the spring drill period
to see these ROTC cadets en masse,
for they’ll be in action the night of
March 24 when their annually‘-spon-
sored Military Ball holds the social
spotlight. To use some of that mili-

tary lingo, orders of,_the night will 

be, “At ease, men."

ng shortcomings whichhe has ob-

ter of a century.

‘'The papers, for one thing, are
definitely behind the times in make-
up appearances,” Mr. Graham stat-
ed.‘

“They could be streamlined‘
considerably. But they continue
week after week with the same
style. They say they have no time
for a change --at least they claim
they have no time.”

‘Praises College Paper

Mr. Graham, who is grand Presi-
dent of Pi Delta Epsilon, the na-
tional honorary journalism frater-
nity, praised college papers for
the splendid job they have done
in correcting the style definiency.
He.explained that they have ac-
complished much because theyare
not afraid to experiment.

Another defect of the daily press
lies in the lack of interpretation
of news stories, Mr.Graham said.
The trend today, places more em-
phasis on the “why” element in
news stories. 1

A possible solution to this prob-
lem would be to alternate columns
of details and background material
in the newspaper.

Make Journalism a Profession

iadequate papers, we must make
