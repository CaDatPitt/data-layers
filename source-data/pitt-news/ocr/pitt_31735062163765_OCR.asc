Landy Appoints Committee
To Investigate Irregularities

Student Government President Marty Landy has appointed a

irregularities” in thevoting procedure of last Wednesday’s referendum,

at‘ the SG "meeting last Thursday.

Rush, Dean of Men William. Crafts, Frances Holland and Barbara
Ginsburg from‘ the Dean of Women’s office and Robert Lock. from
the Dean .of Men"s office, met for the ﬁrst time Friday to look into

‘the matter.

Landysaid, “I ‘felt it would be better to have a- faculty committee

now to look at the matter in a clear way.”

By NANCY FUCHS

Contralto L o r e n e Richardson
charmed a PM audience of ap- A ' 
proximately -50 people, while
singing under the handicap of a .h
cold caught at rehearsal Thurs-
day afternoon. Her repertoire
included‘ 19 songs in four lan-
guages and 2 encores.

In the ﬁrst half of the concert
the German song, Erlkonig 01”
“The Elf King” outshone the.

it required the contralto, to dif-
ferentiate three separate roles,
father, son, and elf king. Miss
Richardson carried it off well,
changing her tone and turning
her body to the left or right to
designate the different characters.
Another German song, Der Tod
“Death and
the Maiden” expressed the poig-
nant appeal of a maiden who
does not want death to take her.
Her voice ﬂowed rich and warm
in that song and in the two Ital-
ian numbers, Care Selve and Al-
ma Mia; however “Prepare Thy-
self Zion” did not appear to be
a good selection for her voice.
Low Notes Forced ,
The low notes were forced,
and her breathing was not smooth. _
In the last selection of the ﬁrst

‘part, the French Adieu, Forets, 

Miss Richardson’s voicepwas al-
most completely overshadowed by
the piano accompainment.
During the intermission the
audience speculated as the re'a- '
son for her seeming inade- '
quacy in the lower note range,

LORENE IRSON

' when her voice had a good tonal

quality. Since Miss Richardson left the platform several times dur-
ing the first half, the listeners thought she might be ill.

After the performance when she appearerd with a fur coatiover
her gown, they learned that she caught a cold by practising in a
draft from a broken window in the SU Supper Room. She had a
scratchy throat which must have been less annoying in the second.
half, because her performance far excelled the ﬁrst.

Lullabies and spirituals comprised the second half. A Brown

iBircl Singing was a beautifully ﬂowing lyric. Miss Richardson pre-
faced the singing of Heritage from the show These Are My People‘

by announcing that it was only available as music for orchestravso

' Morris arranged a piano accompaniment forher. The piano tended _

to drown her out again.

The last ﬁve selections,‘al1 spirituals, climaxed her p\erform’a'nce.
Here she sang at her best. Her voice rang strong and sure, like an
arrow skillfully shot to hit its mark. Miss Richardson explained that
spirituals represent many moods. “Some are quite seriously religious
and others, secular.

endum.
It is believed that some students
voted more than once since they

By TONY CHARIOTT
At a small ceremony on a very
pleasant day recently, th_e cor-
nerstone of a combined sorority
house was dedicated.

?\ The two sororities are Kappa
Kappa Gamma and Kappa Alpha
Theta. Together they are build-

ing a chapter house at the cor-

ner of Bayard and Bellﬁeld.

The idea for such a house be-
gan in the Spring of 1958, after
the third ﬂoors of both old so-
rority houses were not permitted
to be used because of ﬁre hazards.

The two chapters then thought
of selling their houses and rent-

. ing suites in the old Schenley

Apartments. Their National of-
ﬁcers advised, against the idea,
though, saying that a strong chap-
ter should have a chapter house.

The two sororities felt that
their futures were bound together
at the Universityiand thought of

3‘--A--gsuniting their funds to build a

,.-.._
l

:4‘

 

5 chapter house together: The Na-
-tional Advisors. of both groups
agreed upon the idea.

.1 At present the cost of the _new

' house is roughly $180,000, each
"chapter paying $90,000. The house
will have a. basement and three
floors above. The basement will
have glass doors opening onto

,3 a pleasant patio and garden. The

ﬁrst ﬂoor will-have wrought iron
railings overlooking a circular
driveway. -

To run the new house will re-
quire cooks, _housekeepers, a n d
house directors.’ Each sorority will
retain their. present house direc-
tors, “Mom” Berg for the Kappas
and ‘Mrs. McCrumb for the Thetas.
Said Angela Simon, “T_he'comple-

’~"“-tion- of the house includes ‘Mom’

Berg.” Miss Simon is. president
of the Kappa sorority.

In September, 1964, the house
will be -completed, and an im-
patiently awaited housewarming
will be given. Between 18 to 20
girls will live in each side of the

house, the Kappas facing Bayard

and the Thetas overlooking Bell-
ﬁeld.

Both groups are trying to help »

hurry the completion. The Kappas
have a small house, about a foot
long, with a glass front like their
new house will have. The small
house sits prominently on a table
and has become_ a bank. Before
a date may leavepwith his girl,
he must drop a small donation
into the house. Miss Simon, a
senior, lamented, “‘I just wish I
could be here long enough'to
live in the new house.”

At the cornerstone ceremony
on Saturday the girls did not no-
tice the mud or slush. They saw

only the completion of an im-

portant step towards their liv-
ing. in the house. Dean ‘Helen
Rush helped with the ceremony
and in a speech she-linked the
future of the new house with
the future of the University.
Others also gave speeches, but
the two happiest women were
Angela Simon and the President
of the Thetas, Gail Michaliszym.

 

  

CORNERSTONE LAYING CEREMONIES were conducted recently
for the new sorority house being built jointly by Kappa Alpha.
Theta, and Kappa Kappa Gamma. Shown by the cornerstone are

-Professor Attacks ‘Submerged Prejudice’

LEIIER . . .

   

_ .:riiii;ri'r'r..N|:ws, -— Monday;-:;r_eb:u§ry"24; 1904-  a

 

This letter, written in reply to Gene Daven-
port’s Letter to the Editor on February 14, was
submitted by assistant professor of History, Dr.
-William L. O’Neill. Dr. O’Neill is in his first year
at the University after receiving his Ph.D. in his-
tory from the University of California at Berkeley.
His special ﬁeld is American social and intellectual"
history. A

M I must confess that my ﬁrst response upon reading
‘Gene‘Davenport’s letter in the February 14th Pitt
News was to wonder why you printed it. Certainly
Mr. Davenport’s views are drearily» familiar and
hardly constitute an original contribution'to the de-
bate over integration. Why then needlessly offend
_ the Negro members of the University community by
publishing his remarks? ‘F _ _
' . _ On reﬂection, however, it has occurred to me that

V _'Mr. Davenport’s convictions are rather widely held

although not often publicly expressed, and that there

immay be some value in bringing them out into the

'_ open. One of the difficulties involved in ﬁghting

V I ' White Supremacy in the North is its essentially under-
' - ground character.

Discrimination operates_ silently
,a1:1d‘ invisibly for the most part, and its proponents
are understandably reluctant to expose themselves.
But once in a while a Mr. Davenport will let his
mask slip and give us a visible target. Perhaps we
ought to think of his letter as an opportunity to con-
front the submerged prejudices which delay integra-

 tion in the North. ,
Mr. Davenport first argues that---the NAACP,

‘(which occupies about the same position in his per-
sonal demonology that it does- in’ Ross Barnett’s)
is forcing employers to hire unqualiﬁed Negroes.
'The strangest example he offers concerns Saks
‘ Fifth Avenue in New York which allegedly has been
- forced to hire a Negro woman as a package wrapper
despite her infuriating and expensive idiosyncrasies.
To begin with, wrapping is a traditionally Negro oc-
cupation and it’s difficult to imagineany civil rights
group making an issue of it. i
Secondly, assuming that the company had been ac-

 

 we  =1. ..

 

cused of unfair employment practices and had hired
the woman as an indication of good faith, does any-
one think that if the company wished to replace her
with a competent Negro wrapper, or better yet a
Negro sales clerk, that objection would be made?
There are thousands of attractive intelligent Negro
women in New York who would be delighted to work
at a store like Saks, and the "Urban League which
specializes in these things could ﬁnd a dozen ‘quali-
ﬁed girls in ten minutes if it was asked. My experi-

'_ ence has been that stores which make such complaints

often ‘deliberately hire unqualiﬁed personnel to jus-

_tify their discriminatory policies.

Anothenexample Mr. Davenport used was the
case of a Philadelphia" Plumbers’ Union which, he
says, was forced to admit incompetent Negroes to
membership. This is a more serious casebecause it
involves, not simple ’bad’faith as in the previous
example, but the effects of long established _dis-
criminatory practices. _

What the Unions and the employers say in effect,
is that even though it is our fault that there are no
qualiﬁed Negro applicants, we’re not going to do any-
thing to open these jobs until you produce the trained
personnel which our policies have prevented‘ you from
obtaining. This vicious circle has to be broken at.
some point and Civil Rights‘ groups have argued that

since the Unions and employers are responsible’ for

the situation, they ought to accept the consequences.

Is it too much to ask the ‘responsible parties’ to

suffer the inconvenience of partially. trained personnel
during the transitional period‘ before fully qualiﬁed
Negroes become available? It seems like little enough
compensation for centuries of abuse. As James Bald-

win puts it, “There’s a bill due that has to be paid.”'

In ‘justifying segregated housing lVIr. Davenport
asks “why should the white American be forced to
accept a Negro or any other person as his neighbor?”
Of course the obvious answer is that anyone is free
to move if he doesn’t like his neighbors, but the real
point’ is that no individual has a veto power overpwho
buys or rents in his area. I may not want to live next
to Mr. Davenport, but if he ‘wishes’ to buy the house

I lEllER . . .

I

next door, the owner is not going to solicit my opinion,
and I have not legal or moral right to intervene.

It is true, as Mr. Davenport says, that the com-
munity has the right to determine how property shall
be used, that its what zoning laws are for, but his
novel contention that the community has the right to
determine who shall own property is acknowledged
by no civilized society". '

Mr. Davenport also entertains the bizarre notion
that there are “many, many” Negro colleges in the
South with beautiful campuses, splendid facilities,
and Harvard Ph.D’s on their faculties from which
white students are barred. ,

One must distinguish, as Mr. Davenport does not,

between public and private Negro colleges. "The state '

supported Negro colleges are segregated because the
White majority insists upon it, the private colleges are
not, but both private and public colleges with few
exceptions are desparately inadequate, poorly housed
and staffed, and often un4accredited. This is not to

slight the heroic efforts generations of Negro _edu-.

cators ‘have made, but it is a simple fact that im-
poverished populations cannot provide expensive edu-
cations for their children. I

Since the private colleges are integrated, Mr.
Davenport may rest assured that White students
would be clamoringsto get in if their facilities were
as opulent as he asserts. - .

I have, no doubt, «treated Mr. Davenport’s absurdi-
ties with more seriousness than they deserve, but I
cannot close without pointing to his curious insistence
that Negroes have a dominant position in America.

‘ It is "reminiscent of nothing so-much as the Nazi,
charge that the Jews had a strangle-hold on Ger-
many. The most charitable thing one can say of
such perversity is that it reflects a tenuous grasp.
of reality. . . * ‘

Assuming, that. Mr. Davenport speaks from ignor-

ance and not malice, might I suggest that if he isg

seriously-concerned about the position of the Negro

people he join the Hill project? A little time on the’
Hill might induce some compassion, if not understand- _

ing — qualities notably absent from his letter.

 
   
  
   
     
  

 Editor, The Pitt News:

’ As president of -Omicron Delta
ig Kappa,, senior men’s honorary
Wleadership fraternity, I feel it is
 my duty to write this letter about
Jlstudent conduct in “elections on
‘this campus. " -

Dean Albert Martin of the
 School of the Liberal Arts has
. "stated in the past that politics is
..—the critical art of persuading
ﬁothers to effective action. There
are various types of persuasion
’.which can be used in politics. Each
" year at election time some of our
students feel the necessity of
turning to‘ slanted persuasion to
-. win an election. I think that this
method is personally degrading to
those involved and sabotages any
hope for effective leadership.

There are many students in
the ‘class structure who could
serve effectively if given‘ the

discouraged from entering -into
activity because they feel “inside
groups” all too regularly control
activities. I maintain that in
order to get the most effective
-leaders into office, the student
body should have a clear view
of each candidate's experience
and his leadership ability. Too
often these important qualiﬁca-
tions are blotted out by personal
animosities, petty issues and
false rumors.

  ‘Objective Campaign

- Conflict and persuasion will al-
ways enter into politics and I
believe that some degree of these
elements is beneﬁcial. These only

become very detrimental when
they are telescoped into "major is-
sues, which can seriously distort
‘. candidate’s image. -
This year leadership in stu-
dent organizations has been ex-
ceptionally good. It is our re-
sponsibility as citizens of the
University community to. see
that good leadership continues
in the_future. It is our obliga-
tion to insure, that the approach
to any student organization be
encouraging, that those in office
gain strong support from those
who also ran, andthat this ac-
tivity should be stimulating and
cheerful, not a drudgery that
leads to disillusionment.

The only way to elect the most
effective leaders is to make your
decisions the basis of an indivi-
dual’s’ qualiﬁcations and abilities
rather than on some degrading
rumor about his character or per-
sonality. In a sense, college stu-
dents are all leaders. Keep elec-
tions free from unnecessary dis-
tortions and vote on the basis of
a mans qualiﬁcations.

‘Editor, The Pitt News:
In the Feb. 17th issue of The
Pitt News, Senator Jack Koury

stated that the student body was
an intelligent, rational group, not

a bunch of near idiots who can’t ~

think for themselves. Is Mr.
Koury still_a member of SG in
“good standing” or has the “elite”

« of Student Government ostracized

him for his courageous statement?
It seems, evident from its recent
proposals and actions that SG
does not believe the student body
capable of these qualities, but
1'3’Ch'eI'.a group of bungling idiots
easily swayed by our so called
“elected leaders.” ' .

_ In the next few days you the
student body. will again be asked
to vote on next year’s student
leaders. Don’t commit the same
mistakes‘ that were committed last
y¢aI‘- TWO years ago Student Gov-
ernment was scraped from near
oblivion by the honest, hard work
of Tom Olofsonx and a diligent

Senate. Once again another strong
leader is needed topick up the
Dieces of a SG racked by squab-
bles, cliques, and leadership that
is unable to even command the
interest let alone the respect of
‘its own senators. '

_ It is unfortunate that the elec-
tions have become a popularity
contest, but with the only quali-
ﬁcation for senators being a 2.5
Q.P.A., practically anyone can
run. This being the case, you the
student body should want to be a
little more discriminating and
vote for the most capable people
to represent you.

If you expect to have sensible '
leadership, you have to elect
student leaders who are able and
willing to perform a difficult

job. For a change let’s elect-

someone who is capable.

It has been claimed by Miss
Smith that the reason the Senate
is weak this year is because peo-
ple aren't there. It seems reason-
able that any senator pwould, tire

Don’t be lulled by first im-.

posed of both qualiﬁed candi-
dates and friends included on

(Continued from Page 1)
regularities in the voting were reported to the SG election
committee the night_of the vote. “I made the decision to have
the investigation before the results of the referendum were
known,” Lady said.

"Landy would not say what the irregularities in the voting were,
but said, “We have clear evidence that certain things which cast dis-
persion on the integrity of the referendum took place.”

"If the referendum is judged irregular another election will be
held, the new election, however, will not take place prior to Wed-

The election itself saw all four referendums voted down
by thestudent body. _A total of 575 students casted votes.

THE SLOW RUSH

F Illustrated below is_ themembership pin of a brand-new na-
tional fraternity called Sigma Phi Nothing. To join Signa. Phi
Nothing and get this hideous, membership pin absolutely free,

—simply take a pair of scissors, cut out the illustration, and paste

Let me hasten to state that I do not recommend your joining »

    

 

Signs. Phi Nothing. The only thing I recommend in this column
is Marlboro Cigarettes, as any honest man would who likes.
‘good tobacco and a good ﬁlter, whose heart is quickened by a.
choice of soft pacl_:_ or Flip-Top Box, and who gets paid eve
week for writing this column. _ «

‘ I am frankly hard put to think of any reason why you should
join Signa Phi Nothing. Some people, of course, are joiners by
nature; if you are one such, I am bound to tell you there are
any number of better organizations for you to join—-the Cosa
Nostra, for example, or the Society for the Placing of Water

Troughs in Front of Equestrian Statues.

But if you insist on joining Sigma. Phi Nothing, ‘let me give
you several warnings. First off,‘ it is the only fraternity which

admits girls. Second, there is no pledge period; each new mem- ‘

ber immediately goes active. Perhaps “inactive” is a more ac-

curate word: there are no meetings, no drives, no campaigns, ‘

no sports, no games, no dues, no grip, and no house.

Theuonly thing Signa Phi Nothing has in common with other
fraternities is a_ fraternity hymn. In fact, two hymns were sub-
mitted to a. recent meeting of the national board of directors
(none of whom attended). The first hymn goes:

— - H‘ Signa'Plii Nollimg,
Sliiiiiiig star, ’ ’
, H ow we wonder
“ , If you are. j .
_ The second hymn, rather more poetic in content, is to be
sung to the tune of Also Sprach .Z.arathust.ra:
' .. A Guernsey’s a cow,
A road is a lane,
When you’re eating chow,
Remember the mein.

Pending the next meeting of the national board of directors’.

(which will never be held) members are authorized to sing
either hymn. Or, for that matter, Frencsi.

Perhaps you are .wond_ering why there should be such a fra-
ternity as Sigma Phi Nothing. ‘I can give you an answer—an
answer with which you cannot possibly disagree: Signa Phi
Nothing ﬁlls a well-needed gap.‘

Are younsuiicring from mental health?. Is logic distorting A

your thinking? Is ambition encroaching on your native sloth?
Is your long-cherished misinformation retreating before a sea
of facts? In short, has education caught up with you?

If so, congratulations. But spring is upon us and the sap is

rising, and the mind looks back with poignant longing to the P

days when it was a puddle of unreason. _ 4
If—just for a momcnt—you want to recapture those care-

less vaporings, that warm, squishy confusion, then join Sigma"

Szykowny, Tim Grgurich and Daryle Ruby have

provided Timmons with more than adequate‘
reserve strength.

Against the Titans these four players helped

bring the Panthers from a ten point deﬁcit to"

a» two point deﬁcit at halftime. _“The ﬁrst team
was a little lax defensively in the ﬁrst half,”
said Timmons. “When I put the second team
in, they narrowed the score.

“Westminster was going all the way with
their ﬁrst team, and they couldn’t keep up
with us the second half.” This has been Tim-
mons chief weapon all season. The Panthers‘

- are often. behind at halftime, but wear out
their opponents in the second half.

“The guards have been tremendous for us
all season. When Grgurich and Szykowny come
in, we are bettendefensively than with Cal
Sheffield and Dave Roman playing.”

Notre Dame showed great strength in the distance events in
sweeping the mile and two mile runs. They also swept the pole vault
and the high jump. '

By   Vtfre stlers, 19-13 it

Tom Heniff  
Paces Way
With Upset

By FRANK SMIZIK

The ﬁrst match of the eve-
ning was the key ‘one in the
Panthers’, 19-13, victory over
Lehigh Saturday night at
Fitzgerald Field House. Torn
Heniff, who replaced regular

Dulf Killian as a starter, beat Rich
Warnke, in an upset, 3-l. '
“That was the big match,” said
coach Gerry Leeman.
“Warnke would have won that

one for us if he had wrestled the . A

way he is able. If Warnke would
have won I’m pretty sure (John)
Gladish could have pinned Bill
Beck if he had to and we would
have won the meet.” .
Heniﬁ scored two points on "a
takedown in the ﬁrst period and

. Warnke scored one point for an

escape. Both men rode_each other

, out'when they had the advantage,

but Heniff managed" to get over a
minute riding time in the first
period to earn his third point.
Frank O’Korn continued his
undefeated pace at 137-pounds
with an important, pin over
_Larry White. O’Korn was win-
ning decisively when he got his -
ﬁrst collegiate pin at 8:11.

The pin ‘gave the Panthers’ a
decisive 11-0, lead since Mike
Johnson hancrect previously un-
beaten Bill Stuart a 7-2 defeat at
130—pounds. Stuart had been ex-
pected to give ‘Johnson a tougher
match on the strength of some
impressive early season wins.

Doug Koch scored Lehigh’s ﬁrst
win of the night in the 147—pound
class by beating,Dino Boni, .6-2.

In probably the most «exciting I

match of the evening Tom Baily
and Harley Ferguson wrestled to
an 8-8 draw at 157-pounds.iFergu-
son dominated the ijnatch at ﬁrst
and seemed to have Baily over-
powered. But Baily scored a re-
versal in the(sec.ond’ and third

-periods which gave him enough

riding time to tie the match at its
conclusion. . p _
Lee Hall and. Ken Barr both
moved down in weight and won
their matches.- Hall- took Bill
Lackenmayr, 6-1, with a strong
ﬁnishat 167-pounds‘. Barr scor-
'ed ﬁve points inthe last period,
to shut out Ron Bushner, 5-0,
at 177-pounds.
The upper divisions continue to
be_the weak spot in the line—up as

_ both Bill Beck and Bill Bodle lost.

Beck was decisioned by Gladish,
while Bodle became_John Il1eng-
warth’s sixth pin victim -of the
season.‘ -

Brunos’ Filthy Play
Harms Ind. Playoffs

By BILL CABIN

In referring to Bruno’s Boys victory over Friendly‘

City Five last Wednesday in the Independent League
playoffs, assistant intramural director Tom Jones said,
“Bruno’s Boys played the ﬁlthiest basketball I’ve seen
in intramurals this year.” Jones had to interrupt the

game several times to warn the Brunos that their tactics

might force them to default the game.

Despite protests. from the Friendly City Five and Jones’
warnings, the Brunos won the game, 78-47. Phil Daher had 24
points and Mitch Zalnasky and Ken Lucas scored 16 points each
for the victors. Al Janezic, of the Friendly City Five, scored 19
points as" his team was eliminated from the playoffs. —

The Chuckers, who moved into the semi-fnals with a
forfeit from the Falcons, will meet Bruno’s Boys at 7:00
p.m. Wednesday. Although the 'Brunos have been warned
that continuation of their roughouse tactics may result in
their elimination from the playoffs, it may’ prove hard for
them to contain themselves against the rugged Chuckers.

In the first round of Dental League playoffs, the Seniors
defeated the Behoovers, 78-42. George Mihalek’s 28 points and
Cliff Reed’s 14 points paced the visitors while Jim Briller of
the Behoovers had 12 points. » I ’

The Major Connectors moved into the semi-"ﬁnals against

.,the Seniors" by trouncing the Juniors B, 91-42. Miles Ranck and

Gus Oakley had 23 and 22 points, respectively, for the winners

and Lou Jackson scored 20 forthe Juniors B.
1

In the other two first round games, the Acrylics forfeited
to the Plumbers, and the Minor Connectors defeated the Juniors
A. Bob Chisdak’s 19’ points led the Minor Connectors as they

edged the Juniors A, 39-37. The key to the win, however, was '

that Steve Allison and Johnl-lolzbach of the Juniors A, who
had averaged 13.5 and 12.3 points respectively, were held to a
total of 12 points.

In regular Dental B League competition last week, the
Minor Connectors defeated the Juniors B, 72-44. John
Bilowick led the victors with 24 points, while Tom DeMarco
of the Juniors B had 28.. .

Pi Kappa Alpha won the Fraternity BlLeague crown by
defeating Phi Kappa Theta, 47-41.

“With, only one game remaining in the Fraternity B League
and the Engineering league, Pi Kappa Alpha and the Indus-
trials have won their respective leagues with 5-0 marks. .

' There will be a playoff between Delta Sigma Phi and'Sigm/a
Chi, both of whom have 7-1 records, next week, to determine
the winner of-the Fraternity‘ A League. ‘

.Winbrook, with a 7-1 mark, leads the Dormitory
league which has eight games to ‘be played tonight and
Thursday. If Stratford wins its game and Winbrook loses,
there will be a playoff to determine first place.

This week’s top I games will be: Dental Championships,

Monday at 6 p.m.; Winbrook vs. Uncle~Tom’s Cabin, Tuesday at i

6 p.m.; Independent semi-ﬁnals, Wednesday at 6 and 7 .p.m.;
~ and Stratford vs. Uncle Tom’s Cabin, Thursday at 5 p.m.

“Obviously, our long-run future-will be determined by the develop-
ment of our management. Here, every one of ‘us-at all levels of

the Company has recruited widely varied talent—talent that can be
blended to give us the required combination of tight administration and

"Under a carefully conceived management development program, we try to
recruit the best personnel available, both in training and experience. Once we
get them, we have a program for giving them varied opportunities and increasing

ing, ﬁnance, styling, engineering and marketing. _ «
“The program is paying off. We have developed a real depth of management talent
in the Company, and we are dedicated to seeing it continued and reinforced. Because
of this, I feel not only very fortunate in being associated with this management
