Founder
of Black  
Panthers
speaks
at Pitt

Shae’ Felicien

Stajf Writer _

The idea for the Black Panther Party
arose from a poem. When party co-
founderBobby Seale held a public
reading of anti—draft poem “Uncle
Sammy Called Me Full of Lucifer” in
1966, a brawl broke out and he was
arrested for public obscenity and ag-
gravated assault.

During  year-long probation,
Seale created a 10-point plan for
forming an organization he would

later name the Black Panther Party. A

The plan outlined a list of social de-
mands that the party felt all people
should be entitled to make, such as
for housing, employment, justice and
health care.
Seale spoke to about 300 people
in the William Pitt Union Assembly
‘ Room Wednesday night as he relayed
stories of the development of the
Black Panther movement, violence
and injustice.
The Black Panther Party, which
was anactive politicalforcein the U.S.

from 1966 to 1982, called for protec- l

tion of the African-American com-‘
munity. But Seale said that he tried to
extend the party’s objectives toward
other minorities as well.

Pitt mum on budget cut repercussions

Mahita Gajanan

For The Pitt News

l A Pitt oiﬁcial said the University in-

stituted a 2 percent budget cut to all
portions of the University this year,
but not all departments are aware of
the change, and Pitt officials could, not
state exactly what changes have come
as a result of the $40 million cuts.
Provost and Senior Vice Chancel-
lor Patricia Beeson said over the sum-
mer that the administration would
try to keep the cuts from affecting
academic programs by taking most of
the cuts in administrative operations
-that would not affect classrooms.

But University spokesman Robert
Hill said in an email last week that
all 600-units within the University,

A including academic and adminstra-

tive departments, have been given a
2 percent budget cut.

Pitt only monitors to make sure
that each unit is operating Within its
speciﬁed budget, he said. The Univer-
sity does not keep track of the "cuts
each unit makes.

6 At multiple points, University of-
ﬁcials have declined to comment on
speciﬁcs regarding the budget cuts
and have denied’ requests for inter-
views with various Pitt oflicials.

In June, Republican Gov. Torn

Corbett cut Pitt’s Commonwealth
appropriation by 22 percent, and the
University raised in—state tuition by
8.5 percent injuly to cover part of a
$70 million budget gap.

Art Ramicone, Pitt’s vice chancel-
lor for budget and controller, said at
Pitt’s Board of‘1‘rustees Budget Com-
mittee meeting onjuly 8 that the 22
percent cutin state ﬁmding would not
fall entirely on students in the form
of tuition increases.

“We have fully expressed a com- '

rnitment to our students anditheir

families to not place the burden en- »

tirely on their collective shoulder,”
Rarnicone said. “We are going to

cover 60 percent of the budget short-
fall through a combination of central
and unit-level budget cuts and adjust-
ments. The remaining4o percentwill
come in tuition.”

The 8.5 percent hike in tuition
covered $30 million of the Univer-
sity’s $70 million budget deﬁcit,
and the remaining $40 million has
supposedly been covered through
budget cuts to complete Pitt’s $1.9
billion budget. . V

Black Panthers reached out

Founding member said group served interests of all minorities

Black Panther 4 1

included a Q~and-A session and a
documentary screening about the
late Richard Aoki, a fellow member
of the Black Panther Party.

Annie Zhang, sophomore and sec-.
retaryfortheAsian StudentAlliance,
said Aoki was ajapanese American
and the only Asian American pro-
moted to ﬁeld marshall for the Black
Panther Party. '

Seale spoke on behalf of his late
fellow Panther, who joinedhimas one
ofthe organization’sﬁ1st10 members.
Aoki passed away in March 2009 at
the age of 71.

“Our sloganwas not ‘Black Power,’

it was, ‘All power to all people,”’ Seale
said. “That has always been our slo-

gan. It was in the ’6os, and it still is
now.”
Seale spoke about the party’s in-
volvement with other ethnic organi-
zations working toward the advance-
ment of minorities, including Asians,
Mexican Americans, Puerto Ricans
and poor and progressive whites.
Seale described The Black Panther
organization as a group that handled
the “nitty gritty” when it came to com-
munity grassroots organizations.
The Black Panthers implemented
programs that served breakfastto stu-
dents in underprivileged areas and
offered free testing and medicine in
clinics they helped establish. Most
notably, they started monitoring the

police.

Seale said Black Panthers would
follow police cars with tape record-
ers, video cameras and weapons to
ensure that police made proper ar-
rests and citizens did not experience
police brutality.

' Seale hoped that the crowd would
take away two important notes from
his speech. 4

He said the attendees, in their
pursuit of liberation, should make
sure that their ideas, beliefs and un-
derstandings correspond directly to
reality.

“They should hitch their wagons
to the continuing human liberation
struggle,” Seale said. I

Department heads
unaware of budget cuts

Budget < 1

600 units within the University, which include
the schools and the academic and administra-
tive departments, all of which constitute the
operating structure of the University.

“There is no magic bullet here, or single
biggest budget reduction, but rather a 2 percent
budget reduction process across all units within
the University,” Hill said in an email.

Pitt assigned each unit to deal with the cuts
in its own way in order to operate within the
reduced budget. Hill said that individual units
met their budget in different ways, such as by
not ﬁlling an open position, by eliminating a
planned publication, by reducing frequency
of materials that are sent out or by sending
electronic communications instead of using
paper. — _

But a number of academic units seem to be
unaware of the 2 percent budget cuts.

“Our department was not affected by the
budget cuts,” Barbara Warnick, chair of the
communications department, said in an email
last week. “If there is any impact, it would not
be evident at this point in time.”

Warnick is currently on sabbatical and
wasn’t able to able to comment on the matter
any further.

English department chair Don Bialostosky
said thathis departmentis still livingwithin the
5 percent cut its budget received in 2008, and

reduction for his department. _

The chemistry department has also not
faced any budget cuts this year, according to
David Waldeck, the chair of the chemistry de-
partment. _ .

“It’s not clear that anything was cut,” Wal-
deck said. “We have the same operating budget
as we had last year.”

However, over the summer, Waldeck told
The Pitt News that operational budgets are
usually the part of the budget that does get cut
when there are reductions. Operating budgets
include money for things such as paper and
telephones. '

Waldeck noted that the last time the depart-
ment had to make operating cuts was due to
ﬁscal pressures in 2008.

"he hasn’t heard of the recent 2 percent budget -

He said that N. John Cooper, the dean of
the School of Arts 8: Sciences, met with all the
department chairs at the beginning of the fall
term and said that most of the cuts were going
to be taken up through higher levels.

University spokesmanjohn Fedele refused
interviews requests with Cooper.

Waldeck said the only effect the budget cuts
might have speciﬁcally on academic depart-
ments is that there will probably be a decrease
in hiring of any new faculty. But he said that
because of the surplus of chemistry students
this year, the chemistry department was given
special funding for part-time faculty. ,'

Hill saidthat although Pitt didn’t eliminate

_ speciﬁc programs, it reduced programming
— and public outreach in schools and operations

across the board. Four speciﬁc areas received a
50 percent cut in their respective ﬁinding from
the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania — rural
education initiatives, public health programs

. that serve the 68 counties, dental clinics that

provide care to those in need and services pro-
vided through Western Psychiatric Institute
and Clinic. ‘

4“We will continue to invest in programs and
services that provide greater efficiency to the
university andwill analyze each opportunity by
looking at the cost of the upgrade compared to
the payback that would result fromthat invest-
ment,” Hill said. “In most cases, projects that

_ reﬂect a higher payback over a shorter time

period will be given a higher priority.” .

Cuts from the administration

At administrative levels, Pitt officials took
measures to lower costs.

Beeson said that the Office of the Provost
reduced the number of staff in its unit and the
admissions process was made fully paperless.

According to Beeson, officials have made
many efforts to save money. A

“We have taken many University-wide steps
to cut costs ‘and avoid undue expenses, includ-
ing energy-conservation measures, greater
efficiency through technology, administrative
streamlining, targeted staff reductions and
other steps,” Beeson said in an email. '

Beeson would not comment on how many
employees Pitt cut.

Hill said that the University does not have
a speciﬁc number of staff reductions as of now
oratarget number, and he would not comment
on how many staff members Pitt has cut so far.
He said that in most cases, staff reductions have
been the result of attrition.

Each operatingunitis monitoring necessary
staffing levels to maintain the quality of the
programs being offered, he said.

“We are adamant that we are not going to
allow staffing cuts to negatively impact the qual-
ity of the educational experience at the Uni-
versity and the extremely important research
programs, both that have become hallmarks
of the University of Pittsburgh,” Hill said in
an email.

Hill said that the various schools and pro-
grams of the University looked at course offer-
ings to make sure that the courses being offered

at the University were those with high student

this year.

“Our overriding priority is to protect the

the courses that they offer,” Hill said.

Beeson said that the University is working
to ensure that students feel the effects of the
cuts as little as possible. “We will continue to do
everything possible notto place undue.burden

FAFSA forms

Securing ﬁnancial aid is convoluted
enough for those of us with mar-
ried, heterosexual parents. For the
children of same—sex couples, how-
ever, the process reaches a whole
new dimension of difficulty — even
if the results are often more than
satisfactory.

’ As The New York Times re-
ported last Friday, the Free Ap-
plication for Federal Student Aid,
or FAFSA, doesn’t allow applicants
to acknowledge they have same-
sex parents. Consequently, these
students cannot accurately portray
the state of their family’s ﬁnances
and might therefore receive inap-
propriate amounts of money.

Unfortunately, this is no simple
ﬂuke: Under the Defense of Mar-
riage Act, the federal government
is forbidden from recognizing any-
thing besides heterosexual mar-
riage. Because FAFSA is a federally
issued document, it must abide by
this law. As it stands, the Depart-
ment of Education requires appli-
cants in this situation to ﬁll out
the form as if their parents were
divorced and cho'ose the caregiver
that provides the most support -
a process that typically results in
an overstatementof the needed
aid. «

Of course, many would argue
that because the Obama adminis-
tration ceased defending DOMA
in February, this is a non—issue.
After all, suing the Department of
Education over FAFSA’s adherence
to the law should, in theory, result

discriminatory

in an automatic victory and a suit-
able aid package.

We don’t think, however, that
children ‘of same—sex couples
should have to undergo this or-
deal while the children of hetero-
sexual couples need only ﬁll out the
document. Regardless of whether
DOMA is still judicially enforced,
there remains a double standard
in how different parental circum-
stances are handled.

FAFSA’s problems, of course,
aren’t limited to its neglect of
same-sex households — messy
divorces, as well, are difﬁcult to
represent on the form —— but at
the very least, we hope readers will
recognize this as one more reason
to repeal DOMA, an antiquated and
discriminatory law.

Until then, we urge those with

same—sex parents to read a post 9

on The New York Times’ “Bucks”
blog detailing how they should
represent their situation on the
FAFSA. The procedures it outlines
are complicated, but worthy of
consideration.

Financial aid is a constant con-
cern for college students, whether
or not they’re the children of het-
erosexual parents. It’s altogether
vital, then, that the paperwork
needed to facilitate its acquisi-
tion accommodates all possible
situations. Otherwise, the govern-

ment risks undermining one of its _

most invaluable and celebrated
services. I

THE STAMATTACK

The genius of Gov. Corbett’s
Marcellus Shale drilling plan

Nick Stamatakis
Columnist

It’s not every day that you’d call a
new Harrisburg bill thrilling.

But then again, it’s not every day
that the capital produces something
as glorious as Gov. Tom Corbett’s
Marcellus Shale drilling plan. The
proposal is cause for running around
campus with ribbons. V

If enacted, the bill would allow
counties to levy up to $160,000 in
fees over 10 years for new wells. Sev-
enty-ﬁve percent of all money col-
lected will stay in the county where
drilling occurs, and the other 25 per-
cent will go to the state, which will
use the money for well inspection
and road and bridge repair. Further
environmental restrictions will also
be placed on new wells.

Although it might just sound like
accounting technicalities, this allot-
ment system ensures that our state
is one of the best-positioned in the
nation to dispel the negative effects
of drilling while proﬁting from a
thriving natural-gas industry. The
people who suffer the most from
drilling — rural Pennsylvanians
— will ﬁnally see some restitution.
Truly ribbon worthy. . 0

In fact, measures that address
the plight of rural citizens are rare
among these plans. Instead of tax-
ing a ﬁxed amount as the Corbett
plan proposes, other states tax on
a percentage basis; thus, their rev-
enues are largely determined by the
price of natural gas. West Virginia,

’ one of the nation’s largest drillers,

has experienced ﬁnancial stress
as a result of one such plan. With
natural-gas prices at historic lows,
partially because of the rapid explo-
sion of hydraulic fracking across the
country, the state’s drilling revenues
have decreased by about 35 percent,
according to the West Virginia State
Tax Department. ‘

The problem here is that while
tax allotment has decreased, the
negative effects of drilling haven’t.
Stress on local infrastructure and
possible environmental contami-
nation from waste—water storage

ponds don’t cost less to deal with
simply because natural gas is cheap-
er. A ﬂat, guaranteed rate is safer.

The other signiﬁcant aspect of .

the bill — the emphasis on local rev-
enue rather than state revenue —— is
important because drilling’s nega-
tive social and environmental effects
are very geographically concen-
trated. Pittsburgh and Philadelphia
don’t suffer any of the detrimental
consequences of this procedure, and
thus have much less legitimate claim
to any of the spoils.

Also, by keeping taxes at a local
level, municipalities and counties
that don’t want to stomach the costs
of drilling won’t be able to free—ride
on the beneﬁts. If local citizens de-
cide to outlaw drilling, as residents
of nearby Peters Township have pro-
posed, they will be doing so know-
ing they are forgoing some serious
revenue.

By attaching municipalities di-
rectly to revenue in this way, better
decisions will be made across the
state on whether or not to permit
drilling. Much in the same way
students spend their own money
more prudently than their parents’
money, local governments will be
much better at making decisions
without a guaranteed state beneﬁt
every month.

Localizing beneﬁts and main-

Mike Rosenthal I Staff Illustrator

taining ﬂat rate taxes seem like obvi-
ous choices, but most other states do
not have similar programs. A 2009
Pennsylvania Budget and Policy
Center survey showed that very few
states in the country tax using an
absolute value rather than percent-
ages. And aside from North Dakota,
Wyoming and Alaska, which enjoy
far greater deposits than Pennsyl-
vania that can be distributed among
far fewer people through complete
elimination of sales and property

taxes, not all states keep most ben- .

eﬁts local. Arkansas uses much of
its revenue for roads, whereas Texas

sends its money to the general fund.

Other states send money to both 10-

cal and state institutions, but Penn-

sylvania’s local emphasis certainly
puts it on the leading edge.

It appears, then, that Corbett
was at least partially genuine when
he formed the Marcellus Shale Ad-
visory Commission to study taxes.
Though many environmental and
political groups, including the afore-
mentioned Pennsylvania Budget
and Policy Center, were skeptical
of the committee, which did con-
sist of many natural-gas industry
insiders, the ﬁnal product seems to
achieve a certain balance.

Of course, the program is not
without dissidents. Some Repub-

Emphasis on local  
revenue laudable

Stamatakis < 7

licans, mainly in the cities, dislike
the drastic local allocations. Others
see the fees as opposing the “no new
tax” pledges they made to be elect-
ed. Others still claim, legitimately,
that dozens of counties individu-
‘ally extracting taxes is needlessly
complicated. And Democrats and
environmentalists, who insist the
state should try to get more, see
this still as a giveaway to natural-
gas companies. .

But the justiﬁcation for atax at.

all is that drilling hurts local com-
munities more than other similarly

sized businesses. The Corbett plan
is perfectly equipped to address this

key issue. Local governments will -

be rewarded the resources to deal
with the negative effects of drilling,
regardless of the market price of
natural gas. The state and country
at large will continue to beneﬁt from
the newjobs and wages. '
If the -proposal passes, the
natural-gas industry will be less
of a drain on rural Pennsylvania.

'Instead, the biggest drain will be a

big vertical one to suck gas out of
the earth. I

Letter to the editor

To the Editor,

During a two—week cam-
paign in front of the White
House, 1,252 people were ar-
rested for protesting the Key-
stone XL pipeline, which would
run from Alberta, Canada, to
oil refineries -on the Gulf of
Mexico, carrying thousands of

«gallons per day of some of the

dirtiest oil in the world. While
some argue that this will bring
jobs along the pipeline route
and provide the United States
access to “ethical oil,” the real-
ity is that these jobs would be
temporary and the total cost
terrible. Extraction of the tar
sands promises to release huge
amounts of greenhouse gases,
which, according to leading cli-
mate scientist James Hansen,
would essentially mean “game
over” for the climate.. V
Political and environmental
leaders have called on President
Barack Obama to stop the pipe-

line, a demand that we echoed
with a 100-person demonstra-
tion when Obama visited Pitts-
burgh last week, as reported
in The Pitt News. On Nov. 6,
we will gather again to travel
to Washington, D.C., to form a
human chain around the White
House and to stand up for clean
energy. While this pipeline will
not run through Pennsylvania,
it will affect us all. If we wish
to move toward a sustainable
future, the Keystone XL pipe-

, line must be stopped. So please,

write the president, youricon-

gressmen and the ‘newspaper, '
educate your friends and come ~

with us on Nov. 6.

COLUMN

The problem with food taxes

Abdul-Kareem Ahmed
Columnist

 

Denmark, the country with the high-
esttax rates in the world, welcomed a
new addition to its legislative tomes
a few weeks ago: the fat tax. Ofﬁcials
could not be reached for comment,
but the prince of Denmark did offer
this: “Though this be madness, yet
there is method in ’t.” Indeed, the tax
promises to solve Denmark’s obesity
problem, if not Hamlet_’s problem.

Whether it can deliver on the for-
mer front, however, is dubious.

The tax, which went into effect on
Oct. 1, gauges the percent of saturated
fatinfoods, with the current rate of $3
for every2.2 pounds of fat. According
to BBC, some Danes were sent scram-
bling to stock up last-minute on fatty
products, while others began crying
bloody bureaucracy. _

Before we address the merits of

this plan, however, it should compel

us to reﬂect on our own problems.
Only 10 percent of Danes are obese,
comparedto 33 percentofAmericans,
according to The Washington Post.
Should we have" a fat tax? No lobby
or political group seems to think so,
at least for the moment.

We have, however, considered
a soda tax. Last year, Philadelphia’s
Mayor Michael Nutter proposed a 2
cents-per-ouncetaxon sugar—sweet-
ened beverages. The underlying idea
was to decrease obesity rates and use
the revenue to implement relevant
health programs. The proposal
failed. Duke University researcher

Eric Finkelstein later reported that V
. the tax would not have been effective

for high and low income households.
Low income households, he said, of-
ten buy alternatives to soda, and high

income households can afford the tax.
Evena20 or4o percenttaxon sugar-
sweetened beverages would not affect
caloric intake because most people
would switch to untaxed, equally ca-

_ loric beverages.

Despite the research, however, 33
states still uphold the tax —— suggest-
ing America is hardly unreceptive to
regulating public health.

Now in case the fattax gains trac-
tion, here’s the three questions I be-
lieve it raises: First, is it too invasive?
Second, will it even work? And ﬁnally,
is it the best method?

A fat tax is government control, no
matter how you look at it. And most
people will likely respond to it based
on their political orientation. My con-
cern, however; is with the precedent
it sets. A large portion of legislation
is based on precedents, or previous

, similar decisions, and afat tax might

set a bad one. With technology ad-
vancing at such a fast pace, it would

not surprise me if a tracking system .

were soon established that can deter-
mine how much we exercise. Using
it could possibly earn us fat credits
we could use to buy regularly priced
goods (excuse the inanity). Putting
somethinglike that into legislation is
much easier when you already have
measures like the fat tax. ,

A more important question, how-
ever, is whether this legislation will
even work. If the sodatax has taught
us anything, at least one large income
group will probably remain unaffect-
ed. Also, people might start order-
ing fatty items in bulk from foreign
sources or getting fat calories some
other way. Eweryone will invariably
get around it somehow. It is possible,
aswiththe soda tax, that it could raise

revenue, but that’s probably the ex- _

tent of its utility. The modest ﬁmds

would have to be spent wisely.

We should also question whether
this is the best approach to health
problems. What the tax in Denmark
does is single out saturated fat as a
leading cause of obesity. The gov-
ernment and whoever its scientiﬁc
advisor is has decided this, in the face
of debate. In fact, it’s not at all clear
whether saturated fat has a direct link
with obesity, or whether other nutri-
ents aren’t as deleterious to health.
Does singling out one nutrient do
the trick, as the soda tax singled out
sugar? It seems like that decision will
readily be made forus, whether or not
it agrees with the science. A

A better approach would be a
more holistic one, and not because
holistic sounds fancy. That means
using all the research compiled by
scientists over so many decades to
its full extent. Before enacting any

- legislation, if any at all, let scientists

reach some sort of consensus. Let us
be certain that saturated fat is the only
root of obesity. Of course, I’m no poli-
cymaker, but I’d advocate the idea of
pursuing health independently. It is
our individual responsibility to keep
ourselves ﬁt. We cannot always de-
pend on Big Brother to make wise
decisions for us. We should not so
readily relinquish control of our own
diet.

Health research is usually con-
cerned with improving our quality
of life. The public can surely beneﬁt
from its discoveries, but exactly how
the gap between discovery and ap-
plication is bridged is a question for
future leaders to answer. Using taxes

as the reassuring arm between sci- '

ence and the public just doesn’t seem
like the best method. We’lljust have
to see whether this tax turns foul in
Denmark. 3

Q&A

Kathleen Madigan chats

 Scammell
For The Pitt News

a'°°"* *" bu

With 22 years of experience in the business,
Kathleen Madigan is a veteran stand-up
comic. She’s had her own specials on HBO
and Comedy Central and has won both the
American Comedy Award and Phyllis Diller
Award for Best Female Comedian. The Pitt
News was able to chat with her over the
phone about her career and the comedy
business. As the conversation started, Ma-
digan explained that she was with her young
niece: “There’s a  in the car. If you hear
someone screaming, I haven’t abducted a
child.” -
Madigan will perform on Friday at 8 p.m.
at The Palace Theatre in Greensburg.

TPN: How has the job of being a come-
dian changed since you got into the busi-
ness?

KM: I mean ...with the people before
[me], if you got on “The Tonight Show” with
Johnny Carson —— there were onlyithree
channels at the time, so 2/3 of the country
watchedjohnny Carson — so overnight, 2/3
of the country would have seen you.

And now the media is so splintered
and fractured, you can go do “The Tonight
Show” and it’s fun, but it doesn’t really
change anything. There’s no major thing
anymore. You know, now there’s Sirius
radio, there’s podcasts, there’s web inter-
views, there’s blog things, it’s never ending,
trying to get everybody to pay attention for
ﬁve seconds.

There’s so much stuff going on. Like, I’m
friends with Lewis Black and we always joke
around that we spend more time promoting
ourselves than being ourselves.

  

A I Courtesy Brian Freidman

Kathleen Madigan has been in the business for 22 years and has done several specials.

TPN: Have you faced any challenges be-
ing a female comedian? I know comedy is
very male-dominated.

KM: No, I think as far as comedy goes,
it’s;pretty fair if you’re funny. The advantage
is there’s so few funny women, we’re more
memorable. I mean there’s a million funny
white guys. A million of them. Now when it
comes to getting a sitcom, you have a better,
advantage if you’re a man.

I mean, because Marcy Carsey was part
of Carsey—Werner and they used to produce
sitcoms, they gave Brett Butler a sitcom,
Roseanne a sitcom and Ellen [DeGeneres]
a sitcom, because Marcy Carsey believed
women could lead-a sitcom.

TPN: Do you have a good relationship
with your fanbase?

KM: I would say so, yeah, especially
through Twitter. Twitter has been a big
help and alot of fun  It’s really a way to
talk quickly and just answer questions and
respond to stuff; Twitter is ﬁm to me. Fa-
cebook is ﬁne, but there’s too much going
on Facebook to just really be able to do it
quickly, I like Twitter way better.

Some, guy tweeted me yesterday ...If
a celebrity called [ESPN] on your behalf,
you’d win tickets to the World Series game
tonight in St. Louis. So he’s from St. Louis
and he went to my high school. I don’t know
the guy but I thought, “Why not?” if I can
make somebody be totally excited. I don’t
know if I’m enough of a celebrity to win or
if he won —— but I texted Lewis Black and
told him to call. -

It’s just fun. How cool is that, just mak-
ing a phone call can help a guy win tickets?

For The Pitt News

Real Estate

Days

Domino

Rocks Like: the male progeny of a Best
Coast/Beach House hook-up

Grade: A-

Armed with an arsenal of nostalgia, Real Estate
sure does remember the good old days.

On Days, its latest ﬁill-length album, the
band packs more than enough warm memories
to outlast the coming depression of winter
months. V ' - r ‘ n .

Evoking something that hovers between
sunny coastal beaches and familiar overcast
East Coast skies, the Newjersey band presents
a brilliant collection of tracks shimmeringwith
sentiment for good times gone by. With rolling
electric guitar leads, subtle drumwork and
echoey, understated vocals, each song points

toward the same sense of lethargic reﬂection

that’s the heart of Days. .
Advance single “Green Aisles” is an easy
standout as well as a perfect “go take a drive”
song. From thelstart, it’s evident that Real
Estate’s biggest strength might well lie within
singer Martin Courtney’s lyrical imagery. Flow-
ing between “mountains of maple leaves” and
houses “humming / all through the night,” this
entire song is one great, shared lucid dream.
Hiding on the latter half of Days, “Wonder
Years” might or might not ﬁnd inspiration
in the Fred Savage television series, but it’s
certainly just as fond of wistﬁil ‘reminiscing.
Courtney, as the song’s narrator, admits, “I’m

 

' . I

not trying to be cool / I only wanna be kind /
I know that I’ve pissed you off / Baby, better
rewind.” Complete with feel—good, jangling
acoustics that successfully straddle the folk-
pop divide, the tune would make the perfect
soundtrack to a sitcom denouement.

Even on an up-tempo song like “It’s Real,”
Real Estate seems content taking its time get-
ting wherever its going. Consecutively mov-
ing through the tracks, the album gives the
distinct impression of one falling deeper and
deeper into a daydream. In no way is this a
bad thing. .

Days might just be the latest in a genre
full of summery California—esque songs with
shared beach—rock ancestry —- all the famil-
iar elements are present: guitars and vocals
dripping in reverberations and chorus, sweet
and simple 4/4-time drum beats —— but Real
Estate’s unhurried philosophy and surreal take
on memory make the album a worthwhile lis-
ten all the same. It’s unclear how much longer
this particular style will last, but for now let’s
just enjoy one last lazy, dreamy warm day at
the beach. I - '

Misfits disappoint fans

Grade: C-

Rocks like: Metallica, Balzac, Motorhead

newcomer Eric Arce on drums. But the result-
ing album trades the three members’ collective
musical and lyrical power for hyperbolic heavy

strength.

The title track begins with ominous ethe-
real sounds and a chunky guitar riff that moves
toward a steady pop —punk rhythm. The chorus
of “It’s pouring down / it’s come for you / the
devil’s rain,” resonates in Only’s exaggerated
croon and the song ends after an admirable
guitar solo from Cadena.

ALBUM REVIEW

Lady Antebellum keeps it
pop—oountry on new album

Larissa Gula
Staﬁ'Writer
Lady Antebellum
Own The Night
” Capitol Nashville
Grade: B

Rocks Like: Rascal Flatts, Sugarland

Have another heavy dose of musical love and
heartbreak. _ »
Lady Antebellum’s latest album is yet an-

S other edition to the ever—growing stack of music

dedicated to those subjects. But there’s a reason
people keep telling these stories — and this
release highlights it.

Although the country group has been around
since 2006, it’s bestknown for its sophomore re-
lease, “Need You Now.” The LP won ﬁve Grammy
Awards and received the honor of Best Selling
Country Album in 2010. Its title track beat out
several front runners forboth Song and Record
of the Year. _ -

Now, after hitting the studio early this year,
the band has released a new album reﬂecting
the lives of its members, examining the trials
of falling — and staying —— in love. I

This latest album keeps with the band’s style

ofcombiningcounuyandpop,andthemembers S
. keep pushing and testingtheir vocal capabilities.

The songs showcase Hillary Scott and Charles
Kelley’s pipes and their abilities to convey feel-
ings of loneliness, longing and excitement.

The_melodies — more so than the lackluster
lyrics — make the songs _interesting.

For example, the single “]ustA Kiss” is a lyri-
cal cliche, with phrases like, “I know that if we
give this a little time / itwill only bringus closer
to the love we wanna ﬁnd / It’s never felt so real
/ no it’s never felt so right.” Yet a fast tempo on
the piano along with guitars and drums coming
in during the chorus makes the music almost
irresistible.

In what could arguably be a response to a
common criticism from country fans, not every
song sounds poppy.

In “Cold As Stone,” the group ‘eliminates
the piano and electric guitars, instead taking
an acoustic, simple, country-style approach
to the song about heartbreak. What could also
come across as yet another silly love song relies

4 entirely on the vocal power of the band, which

does an impressive job on evoking a response
from the listener.

' Interestingly, the last part ofthe song swings
away from acoustic, entering into a sweeping
orchestra and ﬂute solo to close it out. The artistic
riskworks in the band’s favor — the song leaves

“Your blood runs cold in this twilight of the

Madigan professes love

Kathleen Madigan 4 11

And I don’t think he thought I would do it,
cause I said “What’s the phone n_umber?”
and he was like “I didn’t think you’d really
do it” and I’m like “Yeah, tell me when to
do it and I’ll do it.” I hope he won. ‘

TPN: If you weren’t traveling so much
and weren’t a comedian, what would you
do instead?

KM:‘God, I don’t know. My cousin Mike
is a disaster-assessment guy for State Farm,
I think that would be kind of cool — hand
out checks after a disaster, making people
happy and see all the wreckage. In a weird
way that always fascinates me. —

If I could understand science I would -
work at the hurricane center on The Weath-
er Channel. I love weather. I’m a freak. I
love The Weather Channel. But I don’t un-
derstand science, so that kind of cuts that
out.

I’d love to be a proﬁler for the FBI, but
again I think you have to be able to under-
stand some kind of science, so I don’t know. -
No one told me about these kinds of jobs
when I was in college.

A TPN: You started off as .a journalist,
didn’t you? ‘

KM: Yes, I did, because the only thing
I could do was write; That didn’t involve
math or science. I hated it and in the Mid- ~
west — I was at the University of Missouri
— you were either a business major, an
engineering person, or [in] theater and I
didn’t really want to be an actor or write
plays. I just couldn’t ﬁndanything where I
was like, “Yeah!” . ‘

TPN: If you were to give advice to some- i‘
one who’s going into comedy, what would
you tell them? ’

  for Weather Channel

KM: I’d say you better plan on really do-

ing it forever because it’s a marathon, not .

a sprint. I mean it’s not like get a good 15
minutes and make it throughjohnny Carson.
I mean I’m doing “The Tonight Show” next
week. I think it’s my 15th time and I’ll« still
have people go, “Oh, I’ve never heard of
you.” And it’s like, oh my God, really? How
many will it take? .

You’ve got to just love it for what it is, and
not want it to be any more than what it is. It’s
telling jokes every night in front of people
live and if that’s not enough  Youkndw,
sometimes I travel 20 hours for one hour on
stage. And that’s got to be enough.

And as far as how they go about getting
publicity, if you’re a‘ young comedian, I have
no idea. Because you have to have a website,
you have to have a Facebook, you have to
have a YouTube channel, you have to be on
Twitter —— it’s endless. ' '

I just say, don’t quit. I’ve had so many
friends that are funny, that somewhere
"along the line quit to go take a writing job
or this‘ j ob or that just .because they got frus-
trated. And as long as you*'don’t quit and
you’re funny, you’ll end up making it. And

" by making it-, I mean selling tickets on your

own and paying your bills and being able to
save a little money on the side.

TPN: You sound like you’re really hap-
PY- ~

KM: I totally am. But I’ll go to these meet-

ings and.they’ll say, “We have this show, we’d -

like you to be on it.” And I’m not going to

. be on some show that’s every day ——' no'._I

like my life so much, in order for someone
to trick me out of "it; there really has to be
a good offer on the table, which mostof
them don’t because most of the networks

are so splintered and stuff. N 0 one has the S

money they used to have and stuff. So it’s

_ just kind of crazy. I

Take beads and thread them onto a pin in the desired pattern so that they rest on the
pinhead without sliding of. (If this doesn’t work, you’ll likely need beads with smaller
holes ) Leave a little more than an inch of pin at the top.

Step Two

. 3.!’-
. Place your pliers about a third of an inch above your beads and make a loop around
one of the sides so the extra wire is perpendicular to the rest of the earring and there is a
loop at the top.

Step Three
Wrap the extra wire under the loop and around the pin about three times to secure it. Cut
off the excess wire with your wire cutters or toenail clippers and press the end inward.

ALBUM REVIEW

M83 album like a long, constantly shifting dream

" Mute Records

Rocks like: An electropop dream

Grade: A-

There’s no reason to rush: M83’s newly re-
leased album is a little piece of lovely reality.

Hurry Up, We’re Dreaming, the band’s ﬁrst
release since 2008, weaves together singles
and interludes to create an electric wave of
dream—pop ecstasy, reminiscent of the better
sounds of the 1980s. The 22-track album also
features contributions from Zola Jesus and
Medicine’s Brad Laner. .

M83 adds some new instrumentation —
including acoustic guitar, saxophone, ﬂute
and strings — to its old formula to create a
diversity of sound and take the listener on a
sonic dream j oumey. Anthony Gonzalez, the

band’s co~creator and primary member, has
said that his inspiration for the album came
from the idea that dreams are different for
everyone.. .

“Midnight City,” the album’s ﬁrst single,
takes listeners to an electronic paradise of
synth, throbbing beats and soft vocals. The
sounds expertly complement a hypnotic
melody that makes pushing the play button
over and over a tempting option. \ ~ . :_, V

FOOTBALL

No more uarterback
swaps in he works

Chris Fanelli
Staﬂ" Writer

The Pitt football team has made its
decision: Tino Sunseri will be at the
helm, and that’s that.

The beginning of Pitt football’s
season ‘has quickly unraveled,
mostly due to the lack of produc-
tion at the quarterback position.

- Whether it is Tino Sunseri or Trey"

Anderson leading the team, the
result has been the same.

In head coach Todd Graham’s
opinion, the swapping of quar-
terbacks might have contributed
signiﬁcantly the Panthers’ lack of
success.

“What’s contributed a great deal
to our inconsistency is that you
can’t play musical quarterbacks,”
Graham said. “We’re not doing the
switching the quarterback around.
We’re just not going to do that.

"Tino, by far and away, has the
biggest grasp of what we are doing
offensively, and we've got to get
it out of him. Switching the quar-
terbacks has caused more distrac-
tion than it has positive,” Graham‘
added.

The new system’ Graham im-
plemented requires a certain style
of quarterback, namely onethat
can make some plays with his feet
and make quick decisions with
his arms. Expectations for Sun-

. seri were probably too high com-

ing into the year, considering he
wasn’t a Graham recruit and the
Graham style of “high-octane” of-
fense is usually tailored toward his
recruits.

"We have obviously had incon-
sistent play at that position and
that has caused me to make some

" decisions I wouldn't normally

make," Graham said. 9

The Panthers have lacked con-
sistency and structure all season,
and it’s time for them to get it to-
gether and go back to one quarter-
back as they head into the heart of

their Big East schedule on Wednes— .

day against the Connecticut Hus-
kies —- last year’s surprise Big East
Champions.

Anthony Gima I Staff Phtogapher
Junior quarterback Tino Sunseri takes a big hit against Utah. Sunseri
will not be sharing snaps with Trey Anderson anymore.

’ Graham has repeatedly said
it’s on the coaches to coax the best
out of Sunseri, and it’s hard not
to agree. Obviously, it would be
best if Graham could implement
his system with his players right
away, but that was never going to be
the case. As a coach at the Division
I level, Graham should be able to
get the offense on the right track
by tweaking his system to better
suit his quarterback, so that Sun-
seri can be appropriately paired
with the electric running back Ray
Graham. 4 _

If you compare Sunseri’s stats
from last year to those of G._].
Kinne, the Tulsa quarterback

who led Graham’s team last year,
you’ll see that Kinne ran the ball
158 times for 561 yards, whereas,
so far, Sunseri has only managed

'11 yards on 70 attempts. As a fan,

you probably see those stats and
think to yourself that there has
to be a better option to help the
team. Many fans have called for
the switch to Trey Anderson, and
the coaching staff has tried him out

in the past two games with hor-
' rendous results. On the season,

the undersized Anderson is 12-33
for only 55 yards and has thrown 3
interceptions. It certainly doesn’t
seem like there is much_hope in

TENNIS

Panthers earn
preseason win

Nate Barnes
Staff Writer

After the Pitt women’s tennis
team managed to appear in the
ﬁnal matches of the Women’s
Eastern Collegiate Tournament
without taking home any titles,
the Panthers were looking for
a breakthrough. Last weekend,
they got it.

No. 2-seeded Kimmy Borza
took home her ﬁrst collegiate
tournament title from the Mar-
tha Thorn Invitational, defeating
her teammate Karma Parbhu in

consecutive 6-1 sets in the ﬁnals

of the Flight C Singles bracket-.
Borza was the only Panther to
finish at the top of her bracket.
The tournament, held in hos-
tile territory in West Virginia, left
the Panthers feeling conﬁdent.
“Everyone is feeling good,”

‘Borza said. “This is the stron-

gest team that Pitt has had in
a while, and other schools are
starting to notice after they saw
so many of our players playing in
ﬁnal matches in these past two
tournaments. We all knew we had
talent, and these tournaments
have conﬁrmed that, as well as
given us a lot of conﬁdence.”
The Invitational — in which
play ‘was divided into three
brackets (Flight A, Flight B and
Flight C) — featured Pitt, West
Virginia, Ohio State, Cleveland

‘State, Virginia Tech, Duquesne

and Youngstown State. The tour-
nament was West Virginia’s only
home event of the season. Play
at the tournament was outside
of the NCAA regular season for

‘tennis.

Another sophomore, Taylor
Washington, also continued to
play strong tennis as she defeated
Mary Chupa of West Virginia with
a straight-set victory, 6-0, 6-4, to
win the Flight B Singles consola-
tion bracket. '

In addition to simply being
a strong showing, the Panthers’
victory at the Martha Thorn In-
vitational was also a rarity.

“We have had few players
in Pitt history who have gone
down to that tournament and
won a title, so it was certainly
the bright spot of the weekend,”
Coach George Dieffenbach said.
“Karma should be commended as
well, she played strong tennis the
entire weekend and competed

hard.” “*-

In fact, no Panther has ever
won a main draw the Martha
Thorn since Pitt ﬁrst appeared
in the tournament in 1999. In
winning the title, Borza ﬁn-
ished the weekend with a per-
fect 3-0 record. Her ﬁrst match
came against an opponent from
Cleveland State, Alex Power. Bor-
za fell behind early before she
mounted a comeback and won
in a tie-breaker to advance to the
semiﬁnals. ‘

Borza’s quarterﬁnal victory
over Power came on the same day
that all the Panthers playing in
Flight C advanced to the semiﬁ-
nals. Senior Minh Evans defeated
Danielle Oslo from Duquesne in
straight sets, 6-3 and 6-4. In ad-
dition, junior Parbhu took home a
victory against another Duquesne
opponent, Airlissa Tobe. As a
result, Pitt players constituted

75 percent of the players in the £9

semiﬁnal.

In the semifinals, Borza
squared off against Evans. Borza
defeated Evans in straight sets,
6-0 and 6-2. In the other semi-
ﬁnal, Parbhu pulled out a hard-

fought, three-set victory over *

Catie Wickline from rival West
Virginia. Parbhu dominated the
ﬁrst set 6-1, but after dropping
the second 6-7 she needed a 6-3
victory to punch her ticket to the

ﬁnals. 

In other singles action, Pitt
freshmen Molly and Amanda
Wickman played in the Flight
B singles bracket. Molly Wick-
man won twice on the ﬁrst day,
ﬁrst against Judy Li and then
against Paula Gruber, both of“‘
Duquesne.

In the second round, she upset

Gibbs wins preseason
honor, Pitt rated fourth  

Isaac Saul
Assistant Sports Editor

The Pitt men’s ‘basketball team ﬁnished fourth
in the Big East coaches’ poll and Ashton Gibbs
was elected the Preseason Player of the Year
at the Big East Conference’s media day in New
York yesterday.

It is only the ﬁfth time in school history
that a Pitt men’s basketball team member has

’ received the honor.

The award, the recipient of which is selected
by the league’s head coaches, is a testament to
the season Gibbs had last year.

Gibbs was voted to the All—Big East First
Team last season and led the team with 16.8
points per game. He was also ranked third na-
tionally in 3-point shooting percentage (49.0)
and led the Big East in 3-point ﬁeld goals made
(102). He also ﬁnished second in free-throw
percentage (88.9). His outstanding season
led him to become the 39th player in school
history to score 1,000 points in his career.
Other — now former ——' Panthers who have
garnered the distinction include Aaron Gray
(2006-2007), Brandin Knight (2002-2003),

Jerome Lane (1987-1988) and Charles Smith
(1986-1987).

In addition to voting for Preseason Player
of the Year, the conference’s head coaches also
voted in the preseason coaches’ poll. They
selected the Big East Preseason All-Big East
Team and elected the Connecticut Huskies and
the Syracuse Orange as c0—favorites to win the
2011-2012 Big East Championship.

Both teams ﬁnished with 209 points, but i

the Huskies ﬁnished with seven ﬁrst-place
votes whereas the Orange ﬁnished with ﬁve.

The Panthers ﬁnished fourth in voting,'with
one ﬁrst-place vote and 188 points. Pittwas 13
points shy of third place, which was taken by
Louisville. The Cardinals earned three ﬁrst-
place votes and 201 points. a ' /

The All-Big East» First and Second Teams
featured only one Panther, Gibbs, and had
the most representatives from Connecticut
(2) and Syracuse (2).

The Panthers will return two starters for
the 2011-2012 season, Ashton Gibbs and Nasir
Robinson, and seven of its top-10 letterwinners
from the defending Big East Championship
squad. ' .

In the ﬁnal, she ﬁnished as the Flight B
runner—up, losing to Kate Blow from Vir-
ginia Tech in straight sets and ending the
weekend with a 3-1 record.

Molly’s sister, Amanda Wickman, also
enjoyed success in Flight B, as she had
an impressive upset of her own coming
in the first round against her opponent
from Cleveland State, No. 2—seeded Kara

Sherwood. But in the quarterﬁnals against _

Veronica Cardenas from West Virginia,
Amanda won the ﬁrst set 6-4 but lost the
ensuing sets 5-7 and 2-6 to be knocked into
the consolation bracket. Wickman then
defeated Duquesne’s Chandler Consonery
to advance to the Flight B consolation ﬁnal
where she lost to Gruber. ,

In the top ﬂight of the singles bracket,
two Panthers lost on the first day. Sopho-

more Jocelyn Lu defeated Mells Tank of ,

WVU with 7-5, 6-4 straight-set victories.
In the quarterﬁnals, Lu lost a tough match
to Tea Ivanovic from Virginia Tech, 2-6
and 1-6.

junior Gabrielle Catanzariti won her
ﬁrst match of the day, 6-2, 7-5, against

The next day, Catanzariti defeated
Ikttesh Chahal of West Virginia. After

losing the ﬁrst set 3-6, Catanzariti took '

the second 6-2 and came out on top in

the doubles tournament.

Playing in the Flight C bracket —— and
together for the ﬁrst time in college —. the
Wickman sisters ﬁnished the weekend 2-1

already made a difference on the court.
“I sat and watched a lot last year and
learned from some of the older players,”
Washington said. “I knew I could compete
in the top six, and I set that as my goal.

Over the summer, I changed my coach '

and also worked at a tennis club, where I
coached and then played. So every day, I
was playing for two to three hours.”

The Wickman sisters have already
shown a great amount of potential and
indications of what they will bring to‘ the
table in their four years at Pitt. Most im-
portantly, Borza and Lu have shown that
they are both prepared to step up and
establish themselves as some of the best
players in the Big East. '

Next on the Panthers’ docket is the ITAM
Regional Tennis Championships, to be ’
held in Norfolk, Va., this weekend.

“We saw a lot of strong results from
this tournament, and the team grew from
it,” Dieffenbach said. “We brought home a
champion this week. Taylor really came on
strong, and we are giving glimpses that we
are going to be a contender in the spring.
Not only is this a preview for Big East
play, but also down the line when we will
be playing teams like Virginia Tech in the
ACC.” '3

Tino has
shown
glimpses

that direction either.

"The idea_was to get a spark and I think-

Trey has a great future,” Graham said. “But he
just got here in August and his knowledge and
understanding is just not at a point where he
can play every down. _I think that has been a
distraction, so our focus is, ‘Let’s get it out of

Tino.’ because switching quarterbacks really‘

hurt us in our last game.”

Moreédevoted fans might be wondering
what happened to redshirt freshman Mark
Myers, who was rated the top quarterback
prospect out of Ohio by Rivals.com during
his senior year in high school. ’ 4

. - “Mark was competing for the No. 2 spot in i

fall camp, and Trey won the j o ,” quarterbacks
coach Todd Dodge saidon Wednesday.
Simply put, Myers didn’t transition well
at all in to the new offense and fell to the-
wayside.
“You can’t rep more than two guys [in

practice] ,” Dodge said. “Frankly, that’s what

happened with Mark.”

_ Despite Myers picking up some more reps I

in practice this week while Anderson deals
with a ﬂare—up of tendonitis, don’t expect to
see him on the ﬁeld anytime soon.

With neither the back—up nor the third-
string quarterback able to step up and take

the reins of the Panthers, Pitt should stick

with Sunseri for the rest of theseason.

The starting quarterback showed promise
last year and still has time to succeed this
year. _

“Tino has shown glimpses in the Buffalo
game, glimpses in the Maine game, about

75 percent of the Iowatgame and about 90 '

percent of the South Florida game,” Dodge

' said.

If Sunseri can perform like he did against
South Florida on a consistent basis, there
would be no reason that the Panthers couldn’t
challenge for the Big East title. Unfortu-
nately, performances like the ones he had

against Rutgers and Utah have been more .

frequent.

No matter what level of football you look
at, the modern game is based around the
quarterback. No team can have a real chance
of winning championships without consistent
good play from the quarterback position —
and that’s the main thing that Pitt has lacked
so far this year. ' ' ‘ V

“I prepare like I’m the best quarterback
in the country,” Sunseri said on Wednesday.
“That’s the demeanor I have.”

The conﬁdence is great, but with a BCS
bid not out of reach, it’s time to start back-

ing it up. I
