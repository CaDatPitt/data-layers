In Homecoming Against Miami

By STEVE BUTCHOCK

Hurricane Katie may have
been the last tropical storm to
lash the eastern coast of the
United States, but come Sat-
urday, the University of
Miami gridders will blow into
the Stadium with the same
destructive thoughts in mind.

Some 45,000 patrons, urged on
by the.Jungle Cats’ splendid per-
formance at Durham last week,
are expected to witness the 1:30
p.m. kickoff.

It’s Homecoming Day for the
Panthers and with the Hurricanes’
roster listing 13 Pennsylvanians
besides Coach Andy Gustafson,
who is an ex-Panther fullback
himself, a homely atmosphere
should at‘ least prevail until the
opening whistle is sounded.

Picked in Top Ten

Picked in pre—season polls to
ﬁnish among the top ten teams in
the country with agood chance to
go undefeated, Coach Andy Gus-
tafson’s protegeshave been slowed
down from a violent gale to a
mere breeze.

The Southerners have been
calmed by Georgia Tech, Notre
Dame, and TCU. Their lone vic-
tory came over Florida State.

Meanwhile, the prowling Jungle
Cats will be seeking, their ﬁfth
win of the season which would be
one more than they captured all
last year.

Same Lineup

Coach Michelosen contemplates
no lineup changes from the start-
ing elevcn which humiliated Duke.
Collectively they have been play-
ing good ball and the local grid
mentor hopes that they will be
able to play the same brand of ball
against the Miamians.

At the‘ends will be John Paluck
and Joe Walton. Both have been
playing stellar defensive ball,
making it extremely difficult for
the opposition to run the outside
with any degree of consistency.

Flanking them on the inside are
tackles Herman Canil of Vander-
grift and Bob Pollock of Mt. Car-
mel. The junior steadies have been

and have repeatedly opened holes

cess of the locals’ running game.

Your Reading” every Thursday
night beginning tomorrow at 7:30
p.m. '

Conducted by Dr. Donald L.
Cleland, director of Pitt’s Reading
laboratory, the series will attempt =
to demonstrate the advantage of
, _'reading in groups of words and
__phrases,. instead of the common
word habit.

To speed up the reading rate,
scope, a special machine that
‘broadens the reader’s span of per-
ception and enables him to see
morepwords at a glance. Also, he
will utilize the “reading accelera-
i'tor,” a machine which forces the
reader to maintair;_a certain word

‘ .wide and extensive reading of all
”‘types—-ﬁcti'on, history, philosophy,
religion and science will be em-

Eliot Announces Plane

   

For Student Car Pools

In anticipation of a possible strike by the Pittsburgh
Railways employees, Charles Eliot, assistant to the dean of
men, said the University is laying plans for organizing a
system whereby students will obtain automobile rides to

and from campus.

The plan used last year during a similar strike worked

so eﬁectively that Eliot said the school will follow. the same '

basic plan this year. During, the:

1954 strike, two systems were used. ’

.First, several thousands of
cards, 4 by 6 inches, were print-
ed in .black on yellow with
“PITT.” Students without .. rides
were then encouraged to place
the cards on the sides of their
bookcases or merely hold them
in view of oncoming traﬁic at
street corners.

Students who owned automo-

biles were asked to place the card
in their windshield for the bene-

~ ﬁt of those waiting on corners.

Second, a riders’ bureau was
set up to help as many students
as possible to obtain permanent
rides. The system provided for
students listing their names in
ride books under the particular
section of the city from which

History of Homecoming
Repeats ‘Howdy Grads”,
Open Houses, Electric Displays,

‘Smokers, and Live Panther Cub

, Color Homecoming Celebrations
‘ By NANCY c. JONES 

Every year, about this time, when red and gold leaves,
caught in agust of chill yvind, scurry across the hard ground,
and hearty excited cheers of rosy-cheeked collegians ﬂoat
over the stadium wall, thousands of reminiscing “grads”
get out their dusty college pennant, and a bulky overcoat

mater.

Every year, college groups go into a gay, colorful song-

and-dance to welcome home their
returning “alums.” Not every year
are these celebrations the same;
there is always ' an innovation, a

ing, “Howdy Grads.”

For instance, at Pitt this week,
a sequence of house decorations,
ﬂoat parade,. Pitt—Miami game,
open houses, and a Homecoming
dance will make the Homecoming
celebration one of the biggest ever
seen on this campus. Nevertheless,
in the 27 years that Homecoming

- has /existed, there, haxge been some

gala and elaborate celebrations.

According to old issues of the

Pitt NEWS, Homecoming was
Aﬁrst held at Pitt in 1928. On

Friday, Nov. 9,‘, 1928, the first

fraternity open houses were

held. Fraternity men were kept
busy that night pumping hands
and slapping old grads on the
back as a welcome to what they
called “smoker” parties. The
idea of an alumni “smoker” be-
came very popular and gradu-
ally grew into an annual affair
held on Friday night in_ the

Schenley Hotel.

-It was held every year until
1949, interrupted only by the war
and in 1931 when, apparently;
Homecoming was not observed. In

1949, the smoker was replaced by

the , Varsity Letter Club dinner,
an event started in the mid 30s
and held on Friday before the
smoker. The Varsity Letter Club
dinner will be held this Friday,
Oct. 28,, at the Schenley Park
Hotel. ' ‘
Sutherland, Bowman Speak

‘“The Silver Toppers” radio quar-
tet and Notre’ Dame Coach Knute
Rockne often provided entertain-
ment.

In 19_29, a tradition of having
Chancellor John G. Bowman and
Coach John B. Sutherland speak
at the alumni smoker began. Dr.
Bowman spoke at about six home-
coming smokes, the latest in 1942.
“Jock” Sutherland greeted aulmni
at every smoker from 1929-1939.

Fraternity open houses have
become more important over the
years, until now almost every
fraternity holds open house after
the Saturday game. Fraternity

ed by the Allegheny and Susque—¢

new, more dramatic way of say;

men are even building huge A

decorations for the front of
their houses to welcome back
grads. This is not a new thing
‘forin 1929 about, 30 fraternities
and sororities vied for prizes
with electrical welcome decora-
tions.» Houses have been gayly
decorated in 1930, 1932, 1953,
and 1954.

Two years ago, an old chain and
a new custom were. found. A link,
engraved with the name of the
fraternity which has decorated its
house best, is now added annually
to the chain. In addition, the chain
is passed on each-year to the fra-
ternity with the best house dec-
orations. ‘

' Live Panther Cub
Animals have played -a role in

was given a live panther cub'to

baby panther on the eve of the
game.

At another homecoming cele-
bration “Jock” Sutherland was
presented with a baby lambwith
blue and gold ribbons tied around
its neck. In 1947 alumni released
1,000 homing pigeons on the ﬁeld
preceding the tilt. "

Seating special grads on
benches beside the varsity was
started in 1948 when the “Golden
Panthers” of the golden era were
thus honored. Glenn S. “Pop”

football, coach from 1915-23,
was the “man of the day" at
that celebration.

_ Special Events.
Through the years special events
such as a pre-game buffet lunch-
eon, parades, class reunions, din-
ners,, fraternity dances, and an
open house in the Commons Room
have been held. During the latter
1930s alumni began holding par-
ties at which former dramats gave
skits and former Glee Club mem-
bers sang.-

Captains of Pitt football teams
since 1892 were luncheon guests
of the Alumni Council before the
1928 Washington-Jefferson game.

raded downtown before the 1929

The coupling of both methods
kept the number of absentees’ at
an absolute minimum after the
second! day of the strike, Elliot
stated:

‘ He urges that all students try
now to obtain a ride in event the
strike materializes. This would re-
lieve some of the burden from the
University in organizing‘ trans-
portation pools.

 

SC Anticipates
Railway Strike,
Readies Cards

By RI-IODA COFSKY

Yellow cards might be ﬂashing
again! In anticipation of a possible
strike of the Pittsburgh Railways
employees, Student Congress voted
to use the same type of 4" by 6"
cards that were used during a
similar strike last spring. The ye}-
low cards will have “PITT” print-
ed on them and will help students
get rides to and from school.

In case the -strike does not go

could be used in a similar situation
in the future. Don Miller, Col. ’56,
suggested the cards be used in
Block “P.” ‘
Another means of obtaining
rides SC set up, will be’ rides’
committee which will operate
out of the Dean of Men’s oﬂice.
Students are requested to make
arrangements in event the strike
materializes. This move would
relieve some of the burden from
the University in organizing
pools. ’ ‘

Students were also urged to sub-

mit entries for the Kentucky bas-
ketball" Tournament Queen Con-
test. Two 8" by 10" photographs
must ‘be turned in by each con-
testant—-one ‘full length picture
and one with a head and shoulders

Congress of current plans»of the
Student Union Committee. The’
purpose of the committee is to
propose to the administration
what facilities the student body
desires. The committee will vis-
it the Student Union at Penn
State University, Nov. 3, to get 1
ideas for ‘Pitt’s Student Union
which will be completed by
June '57. -

Before the meeting was ad-

journed, Tom Wiegman, Bus. Ad.

was elected treasurer.

main event of a -1940 smoker.

torchlight. That same year, 5;

the late Dr. Sutherland by play.-
ing Scotch music and perform-
ing maneuvers in his honor dur-
in the half-time band display.‘

Other successful band forma-
tions for homecoming have been

vators. This year similar forma-
tions will be made by the new
“Block P” section.

It’s the little -things that prove annoying. V ‘

One can hardly walk throughthe Medieval Gothic halls
without fear he may be lanced by elongated._wrought iron
door openers or thrown from a high horse -by a solid oaken-
door. swinging open,‘ And if one manages to safely evade
these particular. hazards, he will invariably be thrown
against a half open door by some three musketeers who dis-
play their friendship by walking down the narrow halls,
three ab'reast. A ‘ ._. I .

These particulars can be avoided, we understand, if re-i’
frigerator hinges are put on classroom doors‘ so that, when
opened they can be safely guided against the wall. And if
professors can open doors between class “breaks, there
wouldn’t be any fear of hurting anyone. Possibly some stu-
dent could be aroused from zlethargy to do it. '

We can’t recommend any means other than the Univer-
'sity News to explain to ‘professors how they" can contribute to
public safety, but we do know that Mr} "Ray Coss, superin-
tendent of buildings and'grounds;—'may be able to offer some
sound advice concerning refrigerator ,hin'ges on the doors.

Student’ Congress should send a representative to Mr.
.Coss to ﬁnd out just what can be done; It is important, al-

though it may not seem spectacular. After all, it’s the little‘ -

things that prove annoying;—a little piece of tooth knocked
off here and a little wind-knocked out there.

Services Remlerettli   A

One of’ the most important publications which we keep
-in the Pitt News office is the Student Directory. It is a vital

‘ means to contact students at the University who will, either

willingly or, unwillingly, ﬁnd their names in print. For this

. valuable pamphlet we owe thanks to Alpha Phi Omega, na-

tional honorary service" fraternity, alongwith Cwens, and
look for an early publication of the 1955-56 edition. ’

, Delving deeper into the silent vigorousness_.by__ which
the organization operates, we learn that this is the group

R that provides refreshments for school’ dances and spring

carnival. It also scares people. A Phi O sponsors the annual
“Ugly Man” contest to help raise, funds for the Campus
Chest program. , _ ’

' Although many groups on campus conduct’ novel pro-
gramming, -there are hardly any which do so solely and
sincerely as a‘service to the University as does this particu-
1-at fraternity. Its credo emulates Scout principles. - ‘

Thursday night, _Nov. 7, the organization will hold a
guest smoker in the Panther Room. In the best inter'ests of

. - the University,“ we would hope that a number of students
. affiliate themselves with Alpha Phi Omega. ‘

It certainly is gratifying to

Council might correct one of
Pitt’s notoriously bad faults. IF
is considering to consider to in-
stall penci1—sharpeners in the
Cathedral. ‘ ~

At a recent IF meeting, Sigm
Alp h a Epsilon representative,
Bob Barrickman, Col. ’57, pro-
posed that IF underwrite the in-
stallation of pencil-sharpeners.
The proposal was referred to

Ron Sobel, Col. ’57,’ chairman of
the IF Special Projects Com-
mittee. 4

Sobel has said that he would
like IF to sponsor an all-out
project which would beneﬁt the

himself open to suggestions.

Here’s the second time George

conditioning for the Tuck Shops,
and an attempt to ﬁnd an assist-
ant for window washer Nathan-
iel Ada‘ms have reached his ears,
but .the pencil-sharpener plan
seems to be the most practical..

There are. currently only’ two
known sharpeners in the Cathe-
dral which are available for stu-
dents. One is at the Information
Desk and another 'is well-hidden
in the Alldred Room. There
used to be one at the Student
Desk until someone swiped it.
The cad was probably a desper-
ate engineer whose drawing pen-
cil points had become dull.

Applauded and Harrahed

IF should be applauded, har-
rahed, and encouraged to adopt
the pencil-sharpener proposal
since the other student organi-
zations are busily occupied in
other worthwhile endeavors.

Andy GuStafS0n’S Crew ‘W/elcomccl With Open Arms
Shows Nearby Recruits

By JOEL IVIERENSTEIN
When the Miami Hurricanes enter Pitt Stadium this
Saturday as a main attraction in Pitt’s Homecoming week

they can truthfully call it‘a homecoming. With thirteen
— players from Western Pennsylvania on the squad, the Hur-

ricanes should be more‘ at home here than in Coral Gables.
There must bea reason for all of the Miamians being
Pennsylvanians besides the fact that Western Pennsylvania

supplies material to most of the: '

.top..teams. The reason might be
easily, found with one look at
Miami’s Athletic Department. Jack
Harding, Miami Athletic Director,
received his athletic training un-
der the guidance of Pop Warner
and Jock Sutherland at Pitt.

Along with Harding in the
Pitt backﬁelds of the twenties
was Miami coach Andy‘ ‘GllS_'ta.,1_’- j
son.. When I Harding became ,

at Army, Gustafson learned the
winning habit. In his eight years
at Miami the former Pittite has
guided his Hurricanes to the Or-
ange and Gator Bowls and the best
season in their history last year.

' With only one loss last season
and nineteen lettermen returning
this year Gustafson, uniquely for
coaches, raved, and smiled -about
his team’s prospects for 1956. How-
ever,’ his ex -’-‘teammate Harding

_ matched his optimism and handed .
him one, of the toughest schedules

in ’.the country. ,_ _

country, has won only one‘ of its
ﬁrst four games. Their losses
however, have been to Georgia
Tech, Notre Dame and‘ Texas
Christian—all listed in the top
ten. V V ' -7. '
Against Notre’ Dame, the .Hurri-
canes punted only once. and yet
did not score. This led Pitt assist-
ant coach -Bob Timmons, who
scouted them, to call them, “A.
"good team between the 5-yard
lines.”-' He also ‘said they were a
team of depth’ ahd good size with

K, "a ‘potent running attack. ,, h . '

Timmons held special praise ‘for

While concentration 1 is being
centered on the Miami-Pitt game"
atthe Stadium this Saturday, next
year’s home windup is considered
to be the best the Panthers have
ever had. ‘ ' .

Appearing on successive week-
ends are Notre Dame, Army, and
Penn State. .

After the Penn State contest the ‘ i
, Blue and Gold griders will pay a,
return visit to the Miami Hurri-

than Rouviere. He’s superior in
each of the game's. phases-—
blocking, punt ‘returning, tack-
ling, "running, faking, pass re-
ceivership and leadership.”
Serving -along with Rouviere as
co-captain is senior guard Joe Ko-
hut from Ambridge, Pa. ,Kohut
has shown his special aptitude for
one platoon football by ' playing
better than ﬁfty minutes in many
games.

The other local boys on the
southern team’s starting eleven are
halfback.Jack Losch from" Wil-
liamsport,’ center -Mik_e Hudock
from Tunkhannock, and guard

John Krotec frorn.-‘Peabody High ‘

seem kind‘ of strange coming home

Near the Pratt & Whitney
Aircraft plant in East Hart-
ford, Conn., a full-fledged
graduate center was estab-
lished this fall by Renssalacr
Polytechnic Institute. Lo-
cated ll5 miles from R.P.l.‘s
home campus in upper New
York State, the new graduate
facilities will enable working
engineers from Pratt & Whit-
ney Aircraft and other com-
panies in the Hartford area
to continue their studies.
Without interrupting normal
employment, it will be pos-
sible for students to obtain
advanced degrees in special-
izcd fields from the nation‘s
oldest engineering collcgc.
Designed to raise the level
of knowledge and to broaden
the base from which ad-
vanced research can be
proached, this entire pro-
gram will simultaneously lead
enrolled engineers to greater
achievcnicnt in their careers.
