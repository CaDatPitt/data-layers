“No, 1 don’t' think the honor roll

, should be, published; it gives some

people-‘ a swelled -head.”

-Nodding his head in ‘agreement,
the -companion ‘of the speaker
quoted it was ‘unbearable to have a
roommate whohas‘ been -“in print"
on ‘the, honor roll list. It is not
known what the twenty students
in: lied who said that the honor
rol ..-was the only way to get their
names in print. or that they get a
“kick in seeing their names pub-
lished.” . a

“On the whole, A "about half the
number interviewed did not ap-
prove of havin the honor roll ap-
,pear in the.“ eekly.” “There’s no
.use.oVf ititaking up space” _and “a
name. in print is rather cheap "re-
scholarship” are
some of the comments‘. As recog-
nition for hi h standing, an honor-
ary society: or all classes similar
‘to the freshman honorary frater-
nity, wastrecommended. A former
Universei«(tiy'l gt Califorrlxia student
suggest i rary privi eges to e
granted honor students. “This

.would be‘ true recognition, for then

averages were changed to indicate
how many subjects were being car-
ried, the honor roll should be pub-
lished, said one honor student.

But students mentioned in the.
highest honors section of the list tell
a. diﬁ'eren.tV story.

licity as extra-curricular activities.‘
One young man went on to defend
himself by declaring that he was not
working for grades. “I’m sure',”Vhe
said,’ “that few people who make the
honor roll workV_more for grades
than for knowledge.” ,

“However, all realized some points
in favor of publishing the ratings.
It 2 was felt that an incentive to
work could be offered, but some
"questioned whether students not on
the honor roll really were urged to
work harder. .“I think there: is a
strong ‘tendency to merely term
the list a bunch of greasy grinds,
and pass things ‘by,” admitted one
senior. One ‘instructor found that
one‘ of his pupils, seeing her name
on the honor roll, gained greater
conﬁdence to progress further. On
the other hand another teacher felt
that “it made. students feel bad to
see friends’ names honored and
not /their own.”

Quite sincerely, one girl asked es-
pecially that the honor roll continue

to be printed “because it was the
way, she could‘ find out how

- sess the French Croix de Guerra and

the English military cross, is Jules
Dragusanu, Roumanlan student reg-
istered in the School of Mines at
Pitt. V _ .
Gifted with a. streak of_ daring,

he regarded such experiences, he
said, “I liked it; I preferred’ it to
regular ﬁghting service.” i_
After the armistice was signed,
General Berthelot, commander of the
“Armee duo Danube,” conferred the
French and Englishcrosses upon the
daring» _VRoumanian._ Immediately
after, when'Rouman1an forces mo-

Although he has completed, with
the exception of writing his thesis,
the course in civil engineering at

has always been. more interested in
oil. He wasemployed as business

History of Art Receives S
0 Much ‘of Our Attention, I
Says Head of Fine Arts .

.‘ That, the history of art is‘ « receiv-
ing more attention‘ in ' our more
progressive universities today than
any other subject is the claim‘. of
Dr. Frederick Mortimer Clapp, head
of the recently established ﬁ_;ne"arts
department, in an’ article printed _in
the current issue of the University
Record. '- " ’ _
s ‘.‘The new generation of artists
and the new, American, architec-
ture—-especially the skyscrapers,
envy of all Europe, has given us
anotherfpoint of view as to Ameri-
can. culture, says Dr. Clapp. Mod-’
ern facilities of travel, museum,
and art galleries have all
vtributed « to the change.

person power «of deduction, sharp-
‘ens reﬂection and observation, vivi-

discrimination, Dr. Clapp states.
-The‘ new department, it is claimed,
will enable students to acquire ade-
sire for the aesthetic and a dis-
satisfaction with all that is ugly
and.=.meaningless in their surround-
ings,’ It will also enable students
to study the past fromva/new point
of view, tracing the evolution of hu-

man thought through the succeed-

ing types of art. . _
In closing Dr. Clapp assertedgvthe

work of the new department “will

be correlated with the teaching of

history, the narrative of which it .

will render more tangible; it will
‘be correlated also with literature, to

body; and with science, the theo-
ries and slow progress of which

owe much to religious and philoy =

sophical ideas that found an indi-
rect \ and - notable expressions. in
works of art.” ' '

Since the dayswhen a notori-
ous couple '~“bummed” pennies 
in Alumni hall to buy a copy of '
The Story of Philosophy, the
name of Will‘ Durant has not
been entirely alien to Pitt ears.
Some students have read his
book, still the best-selling‘ non-
ﬁction title; some have read
chapters in it as outside read-
ing in Dr. Gabbcrlls Philosophy
seven and eight; -some have
heard ‘Dr. :Dura‘nt speak at

‘ Joseph I-I‘orne's or the Hebrew
Association; and some are=re.ad-
ing his weekly articles in The
Press. . -.

His new book, Transition
(Simon & Schuster, $3.00), is
sub-titled “A sentimental story
of one mind, andone era;.’’ In
the foreword: Dr. Durant sets-
forth its purpose.

It tries to show the.ef-
fect, upon one ‘growing
mind, of the profound
transformation which mod-
em science and‘ research

A have brought in the fa.ith of

the ‘western world. In a.

Only‘ in the unhappiness his
transition brought to his mother

has the story much reality. In

his attempts to describe mental.
changes, Dr. Durant is almost“
dull; in the more physical as-

pects of his life, he displays ju-

venile mediocrity. ’

Two reasons for reading the
book might be suggested. It
throws an un-antagonistic light -
upon Catholicism,‘ a. pale light,
to be sure, but a light. As does
.Miss Willa, Cather'‘s ‘ Death‘
Comes for the-.A_rohb1'sho1i,‘ it
helps tocancel soinepof the cr-
roneous conceptions engendered '
by the K. K. K. and other pin- —
headed groups, but without
stooping to pro-Catholic propa-

. ganda. Too, Transition helps to
show that a man who devotes
his time to philosophy is not of
necessity a major prophet, ‘av

' breathing compendium of all}
virtues, and a man above men. 2

’It_.is»really‘ disappointing that
Transition. is not more of ¢a—~
book. We need accounts of how

v young . transitioners, adj-ust
themselves to the bumps of in-_
tellectual and physical maturity.
No one else can make the ad-g
justments for us, still it would
help to know‘ how others have

by Floyd Dell, mentioned above, p

THE BEGG'AR’S OPERA.

For the first time since‘ the free _
Beethoven concert last year was the ‘
Carnegie Music Hall crowded. Mon.-
day night saw the Pittsburgh pre-
miere of John Gay’; “The Beggar's
Opera'.” This work had its first per-
formance two hundred years agolﬁin
London. ,During two centuries it
has lost none of its charm-at/1d _po_pu--
larity. ,Much of the credit should go.
to Frederick Austin for his musical
arrangements and settings and to

tra. Half the time we listened to
the orchestra insteadof to the play.
The incidental music to the play is
real chamber music, at‘ least as
played by this’ orchestra and its
antique instruments. . l .
This opera does notegive any op-V
portunities for truly operatic sing-
ing but the'Eng1lsh players. ﬁlled the, _.
roles adequately, both musically and
histrionicully. The Singers rwore.
every bit as good as. ‘any in our
American light opera‘companies,_ and
Celia Turrill as “Lucy Locket,” the
-jailex.-‘s daughter, lent» much color to
the third act which otherwise would
have been rather boring. A , .
The play itself is a. satire on so-. ,
cioty and politics of the period and c
a. burlesque on the prevailing Italian
style opera." The antique spirit was
remarkably‘ well. preserved by the
delightful dances, the [jolly old
rnusic, and ‘the ‘ colorful coslj.umes.~Al1
in all, we enjoyed it immensely and
feel deeply" for those who were not
fortunate’ enougli to get tickets.

S§u'therland’s eleven best will take
the ﬁeld Saturday -.-against avgood

victory for the Golden ‘Panthers will
give them the undisputed champion-
ship of the Big Four Conference,
uéhile a triumph for.-the Presidents

instead of 2:30 as the: other games
thus far this season have.

{For the past six days the Panther
football squad, interrupted only, by
the Allegheny game Saturday, has
bben training hard for the coming
battle. Coach Sutherland has been
workin the boys on plays-that take
full ea antage of"the new lateral
pass rule. Jock still has quite a
few trick plays up his sleeve that
he has .not yet had to use in the
Panther’s six , easy .victori_es. So

the Washington boys have not run

will send. one of .»the best co-ordi-
nating teams to town that has ever
repr_e‘sented_ Wash-Jeff since the
Washingtonv school was fo..unded. In
their ﬁrfst three games they disposed
of Waynesburg, Western Maryland

and Bethany. Then came the sur-‘ »

Saturdays ago they shut out Herb

Edwards, who have been out of the
game for the past two weeks, are
