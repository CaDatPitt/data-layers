A total of 766 ballots was cast
at the three polls. “A' rather apa-
thetic turnout,” was the comment

. made by Dave Menzer, polling

, qchairman. "‘The only encouraging

' part "about the elections,” he
stated .‘‘was that approximately
45 per cent of the voters were
freshmen.” ‘

An array of academic robes and hoods, representatives
colleges and universities all over America 'and possibly
- abroad, will be displayed at the third annual Fall
'tion on Wednesday.
Today the robes and hoods give the connotation of aca—
deljnic achievement. Few people know that their use origin-
ates.from the fact that the ﬁrst¢

universities, founded by the

.Church, were cold and damp.

A robe and hood were everyday
attire to the 12th and 13th cen-

tury students. Although American

universities have disbanded this
practice, with the exception of the
University of the South in Se-
wanee, Tenn., English university
still wear the black,
short gowns during school.
Uniformity Established
While there are not actual set
rules for the style of the gowns,
American universities have set up
an agreement in the Inter-co11egi-

ate Bureau of Academic Costume '

in -Albany, N. Y. This was done to
create uniformity in the dress.
Until recently, all American
university gowns were basically
alike. They consisted of black
material and the hood explained
the degree held by the wearer
and the university from which

he received it.

All the hoods are black with a .

strip of colored velvet. The color
of the velvet indicates the discip-
line or major which is the wearers
ﬁeld. For example,- a doctor of

.philosophy would wear a purple
-jstrip. A doctor of theology would
wear a red or crimson strip.

» Colors Inside Hood

The color inside the hood re-

veals the university. Pitt hoods
are lined in blue with gold chev-
rons. Universities with only one

color would have a solid color in-
side to the hood. ‘

The shape and size of the ho d
marks the college degree d
under the Intercollegiate Code,
one can distinguish at a glance
the bachelors, masters and the
doetors._

In England, however, there is
no code of agreement between
universities. The gowns from the

diﬂerent universities are not sim-
ilar as in this country. Oxford
and Cambridge are the only uni-
versities which have an agree-

ment. Other universities wear
; colored robes.
The foreign universities also

' substitute fur for the American
velvet strip on the hood.

Two Types Here
At Pitt there are two variations

of gowns, one type for the ad—
ministrators and another for the

Trustees wear four velvet

the officers have the university

Other trustees wear this seal on

Dr. Archer Makes
Reporton Summer,

By‘ EDVVIN ZINMAN
“Physicians and dentists are
fourth—class citizens in the
Soviet Union today.”

This surprising announce-

ment comesfrom Dr. W. Har- ’

ry Archer, professoriand head
of thedepartment of Oral Surgery
at the School of Dentistry and
Chief Oral Surgeon of several
Pittsburgh hospitals.

Dr. Archer made a comparative
evaluation of the health profes-
sions in, the USSR when he and
his wife traveled in Russia this
summer, from the Baltic to the
Black Sea. _ ' ‘

USSR when he travelled in Russia this summer. He noted that
health professions are rated fourth in the scale of importance in
the Soviet Union. Engineers, scientists and writers are higher.

clan and dentist are on a par, so-
cially and economically, with the

special technicians in industry. As‘

I previously noted,‘ the ‘health pro-

fessions rank fourth in the scale’

of importance in the Soviet Union.

“He does not enjoy the same
.status as an engineer, scientist,
plant manager, writer or artist
or university professor. Conse-
quently, he receives a much
lower salary and has, therefore
a much lower standard of liv-
ing. This is one of the reasons
why, 60 to 65 percent of the
Soviet health personnel are
women. The men enter ﬁelds

' h A or’ lucrative and ' A
whm are m e . ' charms. These charms were pre-

Dr. Archer told how all indi-
viduals who have any connection
with health“'matters belong to a
medical union, this includes .the
physicians, dentists, nurses, ad-
ministration personnel, techni-
cians, clerks, kitchen he1p,.jani-

Union Collects Dues
, The union is in charge of. social
insurance, sick beneﬁts and pen-

pay scales in cooperation with the
government, organize mutual ben-

eﬁt funds, distribute sanitorium.

the multitude of bureaus which
is so typically a part of the so-
cialistic or welfarestate.

Dr. Archer is an internationally
known authority whose books are
translated into four languages. Be-
fore entering the USSR, he spoke
at dental meetings in Copenhagen
and Stockholm. -

Wears Russian Bracelet

A charm bracelet composed of

many different miniature medals

and pins jangled at Mrs. Archer's

wrist. A simple gold star circum-
scribing a proﬁle of Lenin seemed
to reﬂect more than the other

sented to the Archers by friendly
citizens of the USSR.

.Three new dental textbooks,
obtained during their three-
weeks’ stay in Russia, were held
up by Dr. Archer. “These books»
contain,” said Dr. Archer, “the
complete published- works of
Russian de/ntistry, as far as I

scope demonstrates to me one of
the reasons, why Soviet dentis-_
try is deﬁnitely inferior.

“In evaluating’ the status of
dentistry in the Soviet Union,” he
went on, “I found that dental
schools, as well as medical schools,

vvere the respqnsibility of the

Minister of Health and were not
a part of a- university with the
obvious advantages of such a re-
lationship. , \
Dental Facilities Poor
“Furthermore, while there has
been an impressive amount of
building in. otheii educational
ﬁelds, this— is not true for the
Health Professions. For example,
the dental .scho_o1 in Moscow,“ is
housed in a dingy rundown build-
ing, several blocks from the mag-
niﬁcent towering new buildings of
Moscow University. V
“Visits to dental clinics re-
vealed techniques employed
which have long since been dis- _
continued in the. United States.
The range -of dental‘ operations
is very limited and dental
specialties are unknown. They
claim a higher ratio of physi-
cians and dentists per 1000 per-
sons thanpin the United States
They may exceed us in quantity

- but certainly not in quality.”

Turning aside from the Health

Professions, , the conversation
moved to the Soviet Union in
general.

“Premier Khrushchev has ob-
served," said Dr. Archer, “in ex-

« ~ opinion,”
could ascertain. The lack of ‘

~ pressed their

planation of his"oft-quoted re-
mark, ‘We will bury.you,’ that
from a historical viewpoint he
meant that capitalism has sup-
planted feudalism and now, in his
opinion, "communism will sup-
plant capitalism.”
Reads‘ from Book

“I was surprised that none of
his interrogators asked Chairman
Khrushchev, ‘When will you have
communism in Russia’‘?’’

A copy of a book that USSR
distributed at the Brussels World’s
=Fair in 1958 was produced. He
.read, “The Communist Party of
the Soviet Union organizes and
leads the struggle of the Soviet
people for building a community

society through gradual transi-
tions from socialism to «com-
munism.”

“The revolution was 42 years
ago. How ,many more -years of
‘struggle’ will it take? It is my
he continued,‘ “that

Russia is becoming more and
more capitalistic and less and
less communistic.

_“For example, capitalistic proﬁt
incentives are reﬂected in the fact
that physicians conduct private
practices on weekends and eve-
nings.” . -
Treat Many Patients

“The dentist and physician who
staff the dispensaries or clinics
that dot the cities and towns have
a norm of so many patients per
hour. However, he can’t increase
his salary_by increasing the num-
ber of patients he treats per hour.
Actually, the“n‘umb'er of patients
the average professional man is
expected to treat per hour is so
high as to preclude a high’qual-
ity of health service.

“All health service- care is
under the state health program,
which begins with the factory
dispensary. There are free clin-
ics and recently pay clinics
have been opened. The advice
given to tourists seeking den-
tal care is to go to the pay
clinics, ‘you don’t have to wait,
and the. treatment is better,’ he
tells you, another capitalistic in- ,
novation in a socialistic state."
_Both Dr. and Mrs. Archer ex-

warm feelings to-
wards the Soviet people as con-
trasted with the Soviet govern-
ment. Mrs. Archer remembered
them as “some of the most friend-
ly and honest people I’ve met.
They‘ could not do enough to help

us.”

.  Student government faces ‘a job of education this year.
‘VSGA, the parent organization, and all its sgb-governing bod-
1jes,'must educate‘/the student body about student: govern-
"rnent. C A q r J

 This fact is apparent from the results. of last Wednes-
2‘day’s elections. Prior to the elections, we noted here that
Strange behavior on~the part of students would be neces-
sary to have alarge turnout at the polls. Last Wednesday,
 however, proved to be as normal a day as ever at the uni-’
.versity.

24-Cabinet positionshave ‘a total of 766 friends, for that is’
the nuniber of students who voted. This total‘ is 15 fewer
"(than last year. . , -
1 .AIt~’is "true that a Fall election holds less interest than the
rnajior student government elections in the Spring. But
‘surely. more than 766 students should be interested enough
in theirown government to vote. A i ,.
,, One of the "members of the elections committee said it
if ,was encouraging that 45 per cent of the voters were fresh-’
men. This is equal to approximately one-third of 'the fresh- V
T man class. This statistic necessarily does not have _to be in-
terpreted. op.timistically. " ’ ' .
, ‘SGA could take a hint from this 45 per cent, however.
_,yIt is "too late to educate the seniors and it may be too late
for the juniors. There remain the two lower classes. These
are" the students who must receive this special educational"
co_urse, from SGA. V r _ ,
A _ The Preamble to the SGA Constitution states that SGA
. has been established, among other things, “toencourage an
’ appreciation of democratic values.” Supposedly, these.‘fdem'-
uocratic values” are encouraged through student elections
twiceia year. But ‘what happens when close to 90 per cent
-the students neglect to vote? There naturally can be_no
encouragement of any values. f ' . A

n  Part of the blame forlthe lack of student interest lies
with SGA‘ itself. Many students often inquire as to the pur-
pose and function of their governing body. These students
._‘cA1a.i.m,they never see the results of anything SGA supposed-
"ly does.  ' ' j

* Thus we propose that SGA, through its Public Rela-
=/"tions Committee or through some other committee yet to
'.-be established, educate the persons it represents—educate
_:them so we will be able to say _we have government by
ftr-ue representation and not government by the interested
few. -

Pied Piper Wanted

By Murray Chass

Why the hell are the students at this school so
damn apathetic?

This problem has bothered us for quite some
time, but it has -bec'ome“more pressing this year. It
just ‘seems that apathy glares at us in bolder capi-
tal letters and -is a part of more persons’ vocabu
laries than ever before. ‘

l

Everyone should be acquaintedlwith this word.
_ For those who .aren’t familier '
with it orfor those who haven't
been around Pitt long enough,
Webster deﬁnes the word as
follows: ' a .
x“Apathy—lack of passion,
emotion, or excitement; indiffer-
' ence_to what appeals to‘ feelings
or interest; listlessnessﬁ.’ Web-
ster also quotes ‘a gentleman by
the name of Prescott concerning
this word: “ ‘A certain apathy or
sluggishness in his nature which . » _ ‘ A
led him . . . to leave events to their own course’.”
Prescott might as well have had the students on
this campus in mind when he said that. _For if

ﬁ

"there’s -any common description that can be ap-’

plied to Pitt’ undergraduates, Prescott has it.

There are many examples which have occurred
lately that display this general apathetic mood.
Registration Roars ' A

First, le/
about that mess. But to whom did they _do their

raving? Each other, naturally. University officials

who were present at registration no doubt over- A

‘heard some complaints, but you can be" sure they"
didn’t hear the complaints directly fromfthe indi-
vidual .studentsf ' ' '

'‘Another''example. That Russian comedian, who j

doubles as premier of. the Soviet Union,'Nikita

‘, Khrushchev, had lunch here "a couple weeks ago. _

Surely his visit wasn't acceptable to .100 per cent

.1 of the students. 5

' We heard a few complaints about the “butcher
of Hungary” after the affair was over. But not
one student could shake loose ‘from his apathy
tolwrite, as oneemeans, a letter to the newspaper
expressing his opposition to the visit.‘ , , ’

In ordinary times, an “event such as that ,would
havefcreatedla wild and long controversy among

students. We must sadly realize, however, these '

are not ordinary times. ‘r

An   I nclividual  Responsasam-y

By lna'Amdur V

“You’llva11'be dead in 80 years anyway” was a
sentence that appeared in .\the. Pitt News of’ last
week. This though that practically every human
being living in the world today will have ceased
to live 80 years from now is not too humorous.
When each human confronts H A, .7
himself and admits that he will  
have stopped living in a certain .; f
number of years, many or ,few, -
the impact is startling and’
frightening. —
S It is this problem and its con-
frontation w hi c h constitutes
much of 20th”century philosophy ’ '
in the ﬁeld of, existentialism. V
Such thinkers as Albert Camus,
Jean-Paul Sartre and Paul Til-
lich are some of those who have .
urged man to confront his own mortality. The‘
problem of man’s ﬁnitude and his potentiality for
death, which always hovers over him, arenot easy
‘ones to face. ' ' ‘T

For this reason, most people refuse to think
about them or if they do they deny ‘the’ fact that
they are mortal. Although the doctrine of imrrior-
tality is an essential part of the most religions,
many modern theologians, among them Paul Til-
lich, have discarded the idea of an after-life for
man. Tillich calls immortality “a‘ poor symbol
for the courage to be inuthe face of one’s having
to die.” ‘ _ ’

The courage to be, which is the name of one of
'l‘i11ich’s books, is defined as the courage to affirm
life in spite of the constant threat of non-being.
It takes no particular courage to negate— life as»
some of the San Francisco group have done. Nor
does it take any particular courage to afﬁrm life
with a Pollyanna-like attitude when one is not
conscious of one’s own fate. When there is no con- '
sciousness of. a situationinvolved, courage, is not

admirable but ‘only',,_inv_olve_s h

Le‘t’s turn to football’ for further examples.
After the Panthers lost their ﬁnal two games of
the season last year to Nebraska and Penn State,
there were grumblings. Had this tragedy occurred’
at another school, perhaps one in the Big Ten, the
poor coach —— whether it had been his fault or not
—- would have been hanged» in effigy the ﬁrst thing
Monday morning, if not sooner.

But is there anyone in the audience who knows
how» to go about an efﬁgal hanging, let alone have
the enthusiasm enough to do it? ‘
Appearances Deceiving

There was the Monday after Pitt upset Notre
Dame,«29—26,’ last year when a “spontaneeous” cele-
bration broke out and lasted several hours. Even. ‘ '

that apparent display of enthusiasm was lined with

our friend, apathy.

It took, some six or eight engineers a couple
hours to get the rally really moving. Manyitimes
in the one-to-two hours they marched into the
Tuck Shop, out. again,‘ through the halls, of the
ground ﬂoor and then returned to the Tuck-Shop
because they weren’t as successful as the original
Pied Piper in drawing followers. A \

The engineers, it seems, represent the two ex_-
tremes of apathy.and the lack of it. A few times
during the year, such as Engineers’ ‘Week, the
students from “ the hill” cannot be restricted in
their exuberance. But on most occasions they can
be countedon for absolutely no interest. ‘ ’

The solution to “this ‘problem of apathy is ,a-,
difficult one. Is it‘ possible the university -. exudes
apathy because such behavior’ is inherent :in. a
large metropolitan-university? Or is the situation
peculiar to Pitt alone?

Guided Enthusiasm ._ . _ - .

One student leader ‘offers this explanation of ‘the ;
situation: _“The student’ leadership is still a com-. o
muting leadership, and the leaders who live on"
campus still havea c_ommuter’s attitude.”

= We are not advocating enthusias_m that mani-
fests itselfin removing elevator buttons from their
sockets or throwing ﬂaming rolls of toilet paper "
from dormitory Windows. ‘ '

‘What we’ would ‘like to see'is_an honest attempt , .
at creating an atmosphere that would show 'a-

age to affirm life, however temporal it may be,
accompanied with the full knowledge of one’s’
mortality." . ’
Man’s knowledge of death is one of -the import-S.
ant ways that hel is distinguished from animals.
Animals liver and have no consciousness of their
own states. ' Man is the only organism who realizes " , 
his own death and yet can -live courageously with I .
this knowledge. Man, moreover, it he does. not?

tude which is to be distinguished from the factual 
knowledge that all men die, has lost» one of‘ the V
important ideas which‘ separates him from the‘ rest 
of the animal world.‘ , ‘ ' ' __ S j“ -,

,Each human being‘ in order to ,‘maintain his
dignity’. must not only confront his own mortality,
but developa way of life which will compensate"
in quality for the number of years which in quan- :
‘city may not be. many, One. must realize that if,‘ ' W :-

human being has to live, that he should not allow 3.
society to rule him. ' _
vOn'e of the easiest ways to lose one’s own life
is to submerge it in a great all-encompassing
cause which one thin s will eliminate one’s lone-A-r - "
liness and insignificance. Devoting one’s life to a H ,_
group is ﬁne as long as one does not lose his. S’ l‘ 
precious autonomy in deference to the ’will of the 
group or cause. A -
Thus we have two problems each inseparable
from the other. We know, ﬁrst of all, that all men
die. This knowledge, however, is useless unless it
leads to a philosophy of life which will be a
meaningful one to the individual involved. The. 
question of life’s meaning is essentially insoluble ‘
and in some ways even the question is meaning-.
less. ‘ . . _. - ,

in business.

Bill went to work with Northwestern

“I wanted to work where I’d ﬁnd real

the training necessary to take advantage
of them,” he says. “I couldn’t have made
a better choice.”

to the Trallie Department atCedar Rapids
where he gained experience_ in operating

room procedures, force scheduling and
training and in supervising operating
personnel. He returned to Des Momes
and in February, 1959, was promoted to
District Traffic Supervisor there.

Today, Bill heads up an organization

Toncic’s Toss to Ditka

Pass I Rec

By TED COLTON
_ “We played well together against a good football team,”
were the words John Michelosen used to sum up the Panther-
Duke football game last Saturday which found the Cats

. It was the Panthers’ defensive play that guided them to
their second consecutive win and their third victory of the

y  X ;-1959‘; , T 

 

ord

/

seasonagainst one loss. It was alsoe
pthe first time this year that the-
- Blue and Gold were able to score
in the, first half.
The Duke Blue Devils won the
?_. toss and made the fatal mistake of
kicking off to the Cats, probably

  
   
  

I‘

thinking that if the Panthers
hadn’t scored in the ﬁrst half up
to that . date they probably

wouldn’t start now.
f Team Fired Up

But “Mike” ‘had the Panthers
I fired up, and after taking the
« opening kick-off marched 65 yards
in ten plays. The score came when
Right Halfback Joe Scisly hit off
left tackle, was caught on the
.three, and then with sheer diive
carried two Duke men over with
him for the touchdown.

About the only other interest-
ing thing that happened in the
first half was that the Bluevand
Gold haven't lost their knack of

’ loosing‘ the ball on fumbles.

gThey even went so far as to
have a punt blocked but fortun-
ately the defense 'was able to

Vhold the Blue Devils without a
.score. -

The big play for the ‘Cats in the
second ‘half came in-the fourth
quarter when Quarterback Ivan
Tonclc faded back to pass on his
own 44 yard line, with a third
down and seven yards to go sit- I
uation, and hit End Mike Ditka
on the Duke ten. _ ‘

Scisly Throws Block

Ditka was apparently down but
Scisly came out of nowhere and
threw a block on the Duke de-
lensive halfback and Ditka went
into the end-zone.

“It was a perfect pass from
Ivan,” stated Ditka, the Pan-
thers All-American candidate,
“The halfback from Duke .had
his arms around me when Scisly
threw a block on him and that
sprung me loose,” concluded the
big, end.

The Toncic-to-Ditka pass was
Toncic’s seventh touchdown pass
of the season, tying him with
Corney Salvaterra’s record for
touchdown passes in a single sea-
son.

Riddle Sparks Running
A pleasant surprise for the Blue’
and Gold was the running of
Fullback Fred Riddle. Everytime
the-Cats needed short yardage the
ball went to Riddle and he pick-
ed it up with a few yards t
spare. , .
“Our running game was a
heck of a _—lot better than it has
been," stated Micheloson. “Rid-
dle looked real good out there"
and seemed to have picked up"
a lot of confidence that had been
missing in‘the early games."

Michelosen also pointed out the
play of sophomore end Heywood
Haser for his defensive play and
halfback Chuck Reinhold, whose
running sparked the ‘Panthers first
touchdown drive.

The biggest improvement in the’
Panthers was their play on pass
defense. “Good rushing is the best
pass defense,” stated Michelosen.
And that‘s exactly what the Pan-

“They just had a tremendous

team,” Rees commented. Even

at this early date some observers
are picking the Lions to win the

Although Rees was not happy
with the performance shown last

Coach Carl Rees said of the
