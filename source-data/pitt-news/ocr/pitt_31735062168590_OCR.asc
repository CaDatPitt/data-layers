Changes in Christian Life

by BOB ZAVOS

Men’s Dorm Counci1’s scheduled forum on “The Recent
Changes in J udiasm and Christianity” was changed to “Re-
cent Changes in Christianity when Rabbi Richard L. Ruben-

stein failed to ap_pea‘r.

Thursday’s forum in the Tower A Lobby was led by’

Father Christoper Kennedy and Reverend Samuel Gibson,

Forum

Catholic and Methodist chaplains,
respectively. Father Kennedy be-
gan, “Five or six years ago a
doubter or questioner was re-
garded as an apostle; he was
likely to be burned at the stake,
but today he is more at home.”

We are reevaluating many of
our religious doctrines in this
new theological endeavor, Rev-
erend Gibson continued. The
“God Is Dead” theme brought a
radical reexamination of lan-
guage, concept and meaning.”

Another point Reverend Gib-
son brought up is today’s “in-
creasing emphasis on secular life
at the expense of religious life.”
He referred to Harvey Cox's book,
The Secular City. He also explain-
ed that religion today takes an
active part in our social revolu-
tions, and he cited the work of
theologians in the civil rights
struggle.

His fourth point on changes in
religion was the movement to-
ward a “new morality.” He said,
“We are moving away from the
residue of the old line Puritism
and Victorianism.”

One of the questions directed
to Father Kennedy was, “Do -you
think the changes from Latin to
English in certain parts of the
services is a bad idea. Father
Kennedy jokingly answered that
it used ‘to be you could go any-
where and not understand the
services.

Higher Education Plan

Termed Inadequate

By Candidate Shapp

by LINDA GOLDSTEIN
(See Ed2'tom'al—Page 4)

The pros and cons of the Mas-
ter Plan for Higher Education
were-discussed by witnesses be-
fore the State House Committee
on Higher Education Friday in
the SU Supper Room.

The ﬁrst to testify was guber-
natorial candidate Milton J. Shapp
(D). Lt. Gov. Raymond P. Shaf-
er (R) was invited to appear but
failed to respond.‘

Shapp stated, “After years of
sorry neglect, the proposals of
the State Board of Education
lack the boldness we ‘need to
really make progress toward pro-
viding higher education for every
qualiﬁed Pennsylvania student."

Questioning the Board mem-
bers’ “understanding of the scope
and depth of the issue they have
confronted,” Shapp made the fol-
lowing points:

'> We are_now 40th among the
states in our per capita support
of higher education. ,

\> Our tuition rates are the sec-
ond highest. in the nation, with
only Vermont ranking higher.

> We are sending fewer of our
high school graduates on to col-
lege than the state of Mississippi,
one ofthe most backward and so-
cially archaic statesin our nation.

Shapp proposed “the establish-
ment of -a university _system for

ID’s Required
For Admission

To SU Dances

The Social and Public Relations
Committees of the Student Union
have formulated new rules con-
cerning the weekend dances in
the ballroom. Starting at the next
dance on Nov. 12, all Pitt stu-
dents must show their ID cards
at the glass doors of the Student
Union and not at the ballroom
doors. The entire Student Union
will be utilized for the dance,
including the lower lounge and
the Hunt Room.

Students from Pittsburgh cam-
puses must show their ID cards
and also pay 50 cents. A person
from another college who is a
date of a Pitt student will be ad-
mitted free. No high school stu-
dents will be admitted unless ac-
companied by a Pitt student. The
SU committees hope that these
changes will cause a greater num-
ber of Pitt students to attend the
dances.

The dance Saturday is a Mod
Party. The “Napoleonic Wars”
will p1*ovide the musical enter-
tainment.

HOIVIECOMING TICKETS

Tickets for the Homecoming
concert with Dick Gregory and
Simon and Garfunkle will be
sold today at the SU Cigar
Stand beginning at 4 p.m. Tick-
ets will be sold for $2.75 for
undergraduates and $3.30 for
graduate students on a ﬁrst
come. ﬁrst served. There will
be no sign-up sheet for the
tickets. Seven hundred tickets
are available.

War Termed Immoral

US Vietnam Policies Questioned

by HOBART HARRIS

Anti-Vietnam protest has
been largely isolated from
the great majority of Amer-
ican citizens by both. the ap-
pearance and the motivations
of many of the’ protestors.

Although this impression might.

be more fanciful than real, there
is no doubt that it exists. “The
War Nobody Wants,” a speak-out
planned as part of the Interna-
tional Days of Protest destroyed
this image.

The ﬁrst speaker, Dr. Thomas
M. Cooley, former dean of the
University of Pittsburgh Law
School, began by emphasizing the
validity of such a protest meet-
ing during a conﬂict such as Viet-
nam. “Vietnam is a military ad-
venture, not a declared war,” he
said, “and as such, it is a de-
batable conﬂict up to the point
that war is declared.”

Cooley was concerned about
the effect of the war on our own
liberties. He said that the war
has stimulated attacks on our
freedom of expression that could
lead to a second McCarthy era,
if they are not kept in check.

The most informative presenta-
tion of the evening was given by
Dr. Raymond Richman of the
University’s Department of Eco-
ncmics. He laughed at the Ad-
ministration’s assertions that we
are in Vietnam primarily to bene-
ﬁt the Vietnamese. He felt that
our‘ motivations in Vietnam are
ideological. ‘Not only are we op-
posed to the Viet Cong and the

North Vietnamese because they
will supposedly improve the

Communist strategic position in-

the world, but we are caught in
a situation where we must prove
that our system is better than
theirs.

This stems from the fact that
the US has poured over two bil-

lion dollars in purely economic _

aid to South Vietnam, while the
entire Communist block contri-
buted less than 50 million dollars
to the North. Yet the North has
prospered, while the South ex-
periences ever-worsening bouts of
inﬂation and corruption. “If there
is any economic motivation to the
war at all, it is keep the North
and South Vietnam apart, so that
Vietnam could not become a Com-

   
   

munist shovvplace. Our aid is in-
effective and we are afraid of

dominoes based on economics"

rather than warfare.”

Richman viewed the effects of
the war upon our economy, em-
phasizing the burden which it
has placed on the poor.

Dr. David Montgomery of the
University’s History Department
spoke of the consequences of'the
war.‘ He felt that the war was not
halting Chinese aggression, as
many people felt, but rather in-
creasing the possibility of a con-
frontation with Russia. This is
the result of the kind‘ of war that
is being fought.

There are no Chinese in Viet-
nam, and out of a total of 280,-

Speakers at the anti-Vietnam forum listen to the proceedings.

.—~ “-—\___’

Pennsylvania — a University of
the State of Pennsylvania. As in

New York, this system would in‘-' ‘

elude all public colleges, each
with its own autonomous admin-
istration for internal aﬂfairs.”

Shapp felt that “the flaw in the
master plan is a -ﬂaw of vision.
Where Pennsylvania’s present sit-
uation cries out for bold and
imaginative planning, the pro-
gram set before us represents thy
kind of bureaucratic meekneszi
we have come to expect from our
state’s studied avoidance of the
higher education issue.’.’ ,

Though not appearing before
the Committee, Acting Chancel-
lor David H. Kurtzrnan commend-
ed the Plan in .a letter to Dr. Otis
C. Mccreery, chairman of the
State Board of Education. “I wish
to go on record as endorsing the
plan that your board has‘ devel-
oped,” he wrote.

Pass -Fail

Courses
Suggested

The Liberal Arts Cabinet has
made .a proposal to the School of
Liberal Arts that may be the an-

swer to a longtime prayer of col- _

lege students. The Cabinet has

recommended that the School es- *

tablish “free electives,” for which
students will receive a pass-fail
grade instead of a letter grade.

Tom Sacks, chairman of the Cab- ”
inet, announced that the free '

elective system is designed to al-
low students to take courses in
which they are deeply interest-
ed, but in which they do not have
the background necessary to com-
pete with students who do have
the proper background.

The proposal, submitted Thurs-
day to James Kehl, dean of the
School of Liberal Arts, limits
free electives to sophomores, jun’-
iors and seniors and provides
that a student may take only two
courses of his college career on
this basis. '

Instructors would not know
that a student is taking a course
as a free elective and would send
the regular letter grade to Stu-
dent Records at the end of thr
term. If the grade is a, “D” or
better, it will be transferred tr
the Student’s Record as a. “P."
If the grade is an "F," it will b.-
transferred in the usual fashion.

Under the proposal, courses i—
a student’s major could not in
taken as a free elective. Neith?
can free electives be used to fu';
ﬁll distribution of studies re
quirements.

Free electives courses would

count for graduation, but not for:
QPA.

Freshman Orientation and di-
rector of ‘Freshman Camp are

Snakes, Birds

Props Add To Horror In “Duchess”

by B.ERNIMcLEOD

“Hector,” walls a modern-
day mother, “you will drive
-me crazy always bringing
home bats, and rats, and dead
birds.” Hector may not know it,
but his insanity-producing tech-
niques are old hat. Three cen-
turies ago, playwright John Web
ster included them in The Duch-
ess of Malﬁ, the University The
-ater’s upcoming production.

This Friday on opening night,
dead snakes, dead and live birds,
animal skulls and cats will be
on hand to help the evil Duke
drive the Duchess of Malﬁ in-
sance. A “vicious” dug, a plaster
“dead man’s hand,” and a live
30-pound red-tailed hawk will

I also be part of his equipment.

“The play is ﬁlled with vio-
lence and cruelty,” said Wanda-

 -lie Henshaw, assistant professor

of speech and theater arts, and

 . the Duches of the play. Realistic

props add a great deal to the at-

— mosphere.”

Some of the props were rather
hard to get. “We almost had to
make a. hawk costume for a. pig-
eon,” said Miss Henshaw, “until

. , . _ .~. .,-'“~ ‘ -- "- '
‘ur ‘ 1, W ._  .
-. _ ,. ’

we found the Pittsburgh high
school student who ‘owns our Dre-
senthawk. This bird has a. four
foot wing spread and just exudes
malevolence’? '

According to Miss Henshaw,
the thought of getting a real
dead man’s hand, was intriguing
for its ghoulish effect. The plas-
ter model was decided upon,
however, due to the trouble in-

volved in getting “the real thing.”

“The play is strong stuﬁ,” said
Miss Henshaw, “and, as such,
needs a sophisticated audience.
“The Duchess” has long been ne-
glected and has never been pro-
duced in Pittsburgh before. Pro-
fessional companies usually think
twice about producing it because
of the high cost and difficulties
involved.

Shappk P

Milton Shapp has demonstrated a broad- and progressive attitude
towards the future of higher education in the state of Pennsylvania. Op-
- ponents have labeled his ideas a “pipedreams,” failing to recognize that
A. the educational systems of California and New York serve as precedents
. _for his plan.
 I * Although a majority of our undergraduate body is unable to vote,
 as an educational institution, our University has paid careful attention to
_3' the gubernatorial campaign. The advent of state-relatedness makes such
S attention a necessity. '
 During his apeparance before the State House Committee on Higher
, Education, Shapp hit home about the deficiencies of Pennsylvania’s sup-
7' port of our universities and colleges. The fact of the matter is that the sup-
A _port our state gives to these institutions is not concurrent with the popu-
lation and income of the Commonwealth. ~

Coordination of the manifold schools is badly needed and Shapp’s
system for Pennsylvania could certainly be an effective step in the direc-
. tion of this type of centralization. The lack of an effective plan was recently
I exhibited by the establishment of Indiana University at Indiana, Pa. Aside
from the obvious stupidity of the name, the school is supposedly being
built‘ into a great graduate center. What is the need for another state-
' supported graduate center when there is already Pittsburgh, Temple and

A Column on Trent

Editor, Pitt News:
I wish that I weren’t compelled

to take time off from more im-
‘ portant work to answer Alan Dis-

1er's column in the Nov. 4 Pitt
News, “A Study in Demagogy.”
Unfortunately, however, Disler’s
none .too subtle innuendoes are
unique to him. They.stem, in fact,
from the Dean of Students office,

is mandatory.

It should be made clear at
once that Disler is merely acting
as a hatchet-man for the Office
of the Dean of Students in au-
thoring his compilation of smears.
Proof? Very well. Nothing gets
into the Pitt News without ap-

,. proval of the Dean of Students.

When Earl Trent,‘ who is the ob-
ject of Disler’s vicious but ap-

‘ propriately titled diatribe, sub-

mitted his article describing the

' ‘ reaction of black students on

campus to the second—class treat-
ment planned for Dr. Martin Lu-
ther King, that article was not
printed as written. Instead, ac-
cording to one of the editors of
the Pitt News, the editor-in-chief
phoned the Dean of Students of-
ﬁce and revised M.r. Trent’s arti-
cle in accordance with the wish-
es of Administration personnel.
Deny it if you can!

Since the Dean of Students of-

iﬁce has apparently felt itself

menaced by the protest of the
black students led by Mr. Trent,
it was inevitable that it would
choose to strike back. But, of
course, the Dean of Students of-
ﬁce can hardly stoop to defend-
ing itself with letters to a stu-

_ dent newspaper. Hence the tactic

of having Alan Disler do the Ad-
ministration’s dirty work in this
case.

It will be further instructive
to examine Disler’s allegations in
some detail. In that way, we will
be able to observe both their fal-
laciousness and the bias which
serves to reveal their origins.

1. “Strictly speaking,” writes
Disler, “Dr. King was not a guest
of the University, but of the Stu-
dent Public Affairs -Committee of
the Student Union Board.” I
would be pleased if I could re-
port that the distinction Disler
attempts to establish has any
concrete existence, but it does-
n’t. Student Government, includ-
ing the Student Union Board and

and for that reason, some reply .

-Project,;(HE“.P)e and ‘lays sundry

a company union for the Admin-
istration: it serves as an instru-
ment of social control to keep
the student body “in line.” Proof?
Administration personnel have
interferred unilaterally in stu-
dent affairs, even to the point of
making changes in the Student

‘Union Board budget, ‘although

this budget is supposedly under
exclusively student control. Fur-
thermore, at the one moment in
recent history when Student Gov-
ernment at Pitt threatened to
take on a modicum of indepen-
dence from Administration pa-
ternalism, the Administration act-
ed ruthlessly to suppress the in-
cipient revolt. I am referring, of
course, to Eric Stem’s campaign
concerning control over the stu-

dent body’ fee. When it appeared-

that Stern might persist in his
conﬂict with the Administration,
he was summoned to the Admin-
istration’s star chamber and un-
ceremoniously informed that he
would be expelled (in his senior
year) if he did‘not give way.
Stern gave way.

- So much for the myth that the
Administration has no say in stu-
dent matters. Personally, I would
rather believe in Santa Claus.

2. Disler would like us to think
that -the Student Union Board—

‘hence by extension the Universi-

ty itself——does not discriminate
against its Negro guests. He could
scarcely be more wrong-headed.
Proof? When Cecil Taylor —— a
black musician—apeared on this
campus last Sept. 29, neither the
Administration nor the Student
Union Board made any provision
to meet him at the bus terminal.
A student was supposed to show
up up with a station wagon, to
transport the six musicians and
their instruments fromthe term-
inal to their motel, but he never
materialized. Unwilling to see a
gifted artist like Taylor kept
waiting further after a sleepless
night on the bus from New York,
this writer allowed a half-hour
to elapse before hiring a taxi
(out of his own pocket) to take
Taylor and company to his des-
tination.

Tell me, Mr. Disler, does this
sound like ﬁrst-class treatment to
you. Were Bernard Fall or Theo-
dore Sorenson kept twiddling

7 in the morning because the

undergraduate liberal arts school at Indiana that could eventually feed
graduate and professional students into the state—related universities. Such

duplicity wouldibe avoided under Shapp’s plan where community colleges,
liberal arts schools and graduate centers would be structured within one

State officials should realize (as? has Shapp) that Pennsylvania is
not contributing sufficient funds to the support of these institutions. A
vicious cycle thus occurs because the tuition rates of the state—related uni-

versities remain high and still some students cannot afford to attend the

colleges. Pennsylvanians then either do not go on to college or they go to
low cost schools in other states. Those who leave the Commonwealth often
settle in the states where they received their education. '

Shapp is correct when he says that the present Master Plan of the
state lacks vision. It calls for entrance of only 51 per cent of all high school
graduates. Considering the fact that the national average is 54 per cent,
the officials should be hoping for a much more impressive entrance rate.

The dynamic and tireless campaign for better higher education in
Pennsylvania by Shapp shows that he would attempt to bring vast im-
provement to the present system if he is elected Governolr tomorrow. We
only hope that when members of the University community cast their

ballots they will carefully weigh the educational proposals of the two

gubernatorial candidates.

the

accusations of prote - subversion
against it, in the best McCarthy-
ite style. What is the truth here?

To begin with, Disler’s under-
handed attack against HEP only
makes sense’ in the context of a
prolonged brushﬁre war which
the Dean of Students office has
been waging against HEP. (On
the other hand, it must be noted
that . the_ University Chancellor
has gone on record as praising
HEP’s performance -— the differ-
ence, one supposes, between en-
lightened paternalism and reﬂex
reaction.) There is no reason for
the name of HEP even to be
raised here',‘except for the Dean
of Students’ animus" against it.
Mr. Trent, in organizing the black
student protest, was acting in his
capacity as an individual—-not as
a spokesmen for HEP; Disler is the
only person who has even men-
tioned HEP. If, moreover, he is
going to insist on pulling in HEP
by the hair, so to speak, then
why not Alpha Phi Alpha (fra-
ternity, whose president, Ernest
Meyers, was, according to the
Pitt News (Nov. 4, page two),
also involved in the leadership of
the protest against anti-Negro
discrimination on the part of the
University? Why? Because the

Dean of Students office does not.

conceive of Alpha. Phi Alpha as a
threat to the status quo, that’s
why. Nothing better indicates the
source and the spurious nature of
Disler’s “charges” against HEP
and Mr. Trent than the curious
logic which allows him to attack
HEP while ignoring the role of
the black social organizations on
campus.

4. “Last Month,” Mr. Disler
thunders forth in his best Mc-
Carthy-style tones, “HEP was in-
strumental in bringing together
for a projected series of panel

,' discussions such radical groups as

the Student for Non-Violent Co-
ordinating Committee, Students
for Peace, Students for a Demo-
cratic Society, Committee to End
the War in Vietnam, and the com-
munist (sic) W. E. B. DuBois

Club.” Right out of J. Edgar‘

Hoover, no? Why doesn’t he just
call HEP a Commie-front and
have done with it?

One’s ﬁrst response to this
peurile effort is to shrug one’s
shoulders. So? So what? But
truth must be served——even if
Disler suffers in the process.

The fact is that I-EP was in no
sense “instrumental” in bringing

about -this meeting. HEP simply’

agreed to procure a room for the

well-known subversive group the

  

 

 i t o 1'

American Friends Service Com-
mittee, so that organization could
have a meeting on this campus.
The moral, if you will, is not
that HEP is the radical organiza-
tion which Disler would have us
believe-——although what would be
wrong if HEP were radical. I for
one fail to seee-but that this cam-
pus is run in such a restrictive
fashion from the Dean of Stu-
dents office that groups like
SNCC and SDS can’t get recogni-
tion so that they might obtain
their rooms, thus forcing HEP'or
other. organizations to serve as
intermediaries. The way to over-
come the situation,» needless to
say, is not to emulate Disler’s
orgy of mindless red-bating, but
to liberalize recognition rules to
the point that any student po-
litical organization of any per-
suasion can’ obtain “legitimate”
status.

Students who have been at
other campuses——there are other
campuses you know — are well
aware that the pall which hangs
over this one emanates primarily
from the office of the Dean of
Students. Disler’s pathetic at-
tempts at red- and black-baiting
only show the degree to which
student affairs in general, and
student journalism in particular,
can degenerate when students
are too timid or too apathetic to
emancipate themselves from the
crushing weight of in loco pa-
ternalism.

Grads Attack

Sports Coverage

Editor, Pitt News:

As observers of the recent soft-
ball game between Pi Lambda
Phi and the Grads, we are thor-
oughly disgusted with the inade-
quate and biased coverage on the
part of the Pitt News.

The Grads have previously

iproven their superiority in the

intramural league during the

[spring term when they won the

campus championship. We might
add that at that time their wins
were not recorded in the Pitt
News. This fall they won 13
games without acknowledgment.
Now they are again campus in-
tramural champions, and the
only recognition that they re-
ceived was two small paragraphs.
Even this meager offering was
chieﬂy devoted to making ex-
cuses for the _Pi Lams by men-
tioning the four team members
who were not even interested
enough to support their fraterni-
ty team.

Where was the account of the
important action in the game.
Was the writer really at the
game or did he just not notice
that Randy Smith pitched a shut
out game; that Lutz Kurzweg
brought in six RBIs; that Tom
Watson and Lutz Kurzweg did a
ﬁne job in the ﬁeld; that the
Grads had 23 hits; and that seven
out of the ten team members
scored? .

It has been recently noted that
graduate students " receive free
copies of the Pitt News., Who
wants a newspaper that consis-
tently ignores those students for
which the staff contends that it
serves. We assert that since the
grads did go “bang,” the Pitt
News should be able to do more
than whimper.

Banner said, “All the boys have

. SOUTH BEND, Ind-—iAra Parseghian, the Notre Dame
head coach was pacing up and down the sidelines in the ﬁrst
half. He was worried, real worried. All he Wants this year is

the national championship. As far
as he’s concerned that’s not too
much to ask for from what some
consider to be the best team in
collegiate history.

Yet for 30 minutes Saturday
afternoon, he must have been ap-
proaching a state of shock. The
loud speaker system was keeping
the Irish informed of the prog-
ress of Michigan State, which
was piling it on Iowa, 56-7. State
is the biggest obstacle to Ara’s
championship desires.

At the same time in South
Bend the mighty Irish had only
managed to establish an embar-
rassing 7-O halftime lead over
the Panthers, who were a 39
point underdog.

As the teams exited from the
ﬁeld at the end of the ﬁrst, Par-
seghian and Dave_ Hart bumped
shoulders. Ara told Hart then,
“that it was the. roughest first half

that anyone has played against
us this year.”

What he said to his own play-
ers in the locker room during
the half probably wasn’t quite
that calm. “You can bet that I
had something to say,” said Par-
seghian after the game.

It wasn’t as much what Parse-
ghian said that ﬁnally broke open
the game in the second half. It
was more what Nick Eddy did.
Eddy, one of the greatest backs
in Irish history, returned the sec-
ond half kickoﬁ 85 yards for a
touchdown. From that point on it
was only a question of how many
more points Notre Dame would
score.

But for 30 minutes, the Pan-
thers were basking in pride. For
over 25 minutes, they had held
the top oﬁensive team in the na-

tion scoreless. As Jim Flanigan
said, “I was tense but I was also
playing it free and risky because
we had nothing to lose.” Flani-'
gan recovered one fumble and
was in on 17 tackles.

Tippy Pohl, Joe Curtin and
Bobby Dyer picked off three of
Terry Hanratty’s passes in that
opening half _and it was easy to
_tell that Hanratty was more than
a little bit disturbed.

In his defense, his favorite re-
cciver, Jim Seymour, didn’t play
because of an injury, but Han-
ratty was still far from-. the great-
est quarterback in college today.
Very far.

The Panther offense wasn't ex-
actly going places either. But that
was to be expected. What wasn’t
expected was their failure to
give up the ball in the ﬁrst half
because of mistakes. For the

game Joe Jones gained 90 yards
in 20 carries and Mike Raklewicz
carred the ball 12 ‘times for 45
yards. —

After the game Parseghian was
resting a little easier. With a
40-0 score he could also afford to
be a little complimentary. “I
don't compare teams as a rule,”
said Parseglriian, “but I told Hart
that he’s got everyreason to be
damn proud of his kids‘.

“I have uneasy moments every
game. The_re’s no such thing as an
easy game any more. Today was
a perfect situation for Pitt. They
had that 69-13 score from last
year and only one win this year
going for them. They were ready
for us and we were ﬂat.

First half efforts don’t count in
the record book, however. It’s
really too bad because this year's
Panthers won’t have much else to
look back at in years to come.

Litchﬁeld eliminated Random.

threw two touchdown passes to
Ross Landfried to pace the at-
tack. '

In Hawthorne House’s easy win
over Stratford, quarterback Earl
Fischl threw three ‘TD passes.
Steve Cohan pulled down two for
12 points and Don Allard another
on a 40 yard scoring play.

In the closest game of the af-
ternoon, the Beacon House quar-
terback threw a fourth down TD
pass late in the fourth quarter
to help him team squeak to a 12-6
victory.

There was no scoring during
the ﬁrst half of the Sigma Al-
pha Epsilon-Phi Gamma Delta
game in fraternity “B” league.
But Richy Andolini,_ SAE quar-
terback, threw two touchdown

team could score and the over-

Akron Upset

By Booters
On Lone Goal

For 16 minutes the Akron bench
was conﬁdent. For the next hour‘
they were hopeful. In the last
quarter they were desperate.
They were witnessing what most
of them couldn’t believe. They
were watching the booters shut

them out 1-0: at Forbes Field.

Confrontation

Feared Over
Russian Aid

(Continued from Page 1)
000 Communist troops in South
Vietnam, only 30,000 of them
are North Vietnamese; the great
majority are South Vietnamese

guerillas. The North Vietnamese '

are perfectly capable of supply-
ing such troops with the small
arms that they need.

The only outside aid that the
North Vietnamese need, air de
fense equipment, is the direct re-
sult of American bombing raids.
However, it is not the Chinese
that supply these weapons, but
the Russians. This means that if
the United States takes action to
stop the ﬂow of anti-‘aircraft
weapons into North Vietnam, she
would necessarily be taking ac-
tion against Russia, not China.
