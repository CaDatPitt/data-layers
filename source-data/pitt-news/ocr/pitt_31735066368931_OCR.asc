Injured Gymnast EndsSit-in ofterPosvci

By TOM KUKUCKA
PittNews Siaffwriter _

Injured Pitt gymnast Thomas A.
Cardamone ended his one-day sit-in
in the Cathedral Commons Room
Friday afternoon after meeting with
Chancellor Posvar.

Cardamone, who lost the use of
his arms and legs after falling from
a set of exercise rings in "1972, said
his discussion with Posvar and
Assistant Chancellor Edward Bozik
was “satisfying.” —

“They recognized the fact that
the issue is valid,” Cardamone,
accompanied by his parents, said
after emerging from the 90-minute
session. “The discussion ended up
to be very emotional. It the

. beginning we had to rehash some

legal -positions that naturally the
Chancellor was‘ not aware of. The
Chancellor is on our side. He has
taken a position -now that he will do

everything he possibly can.”

' But Posvar indicated the case still

was under litigation and that the

courts most likely" would decide the
ﬁnal outcome.

'“All I can do is offer the
maximum services of the University
and assist Tom as a student,”
Posvar said. “I can't comment on it
because it is a legal question, and
frankly, there are many details of it
that I’m,not aware of.

“When you are dealing with
courts of law and litigation, it isn’t a
matter of having your way,” Posvar
added. ‘.‘I want to see done for this
young man whatever is possible.”

Cardamone, 27, of Bethel Park,
sued the University for negligence
last_ year, but a Common Pleas

Court jury handed down a 10-2

decision. in favor of Pitt last
January. Cardamone appealed the
case, but on Aug. 3 Judge John P.
Flaherty denied the move for a
retrial. ‘ »
Car_damone’s attorneys currently
are attempting to appeal Flaherty~’s
decision to the state Superior Court.
Cardamone is asking for $30,000 to

$34,000 a year in medical expenses. .

Cardamone said Thursday night
his protest was not staged to

Pitt Police this weekend
apprehended and charged a
Sewickley man with the alleged
Oct. 12 rape of at Lothrop Hall
Resident. ’ [

A warrant for the arrest of
Glenn L. Johnson, 25, was
issued Friday evening following
the identiﬁcation of his photo by
the victim at City Youth and Sex .
Squad Headquarters down-
town. _

Johnson was picked up by

Pitt police officers Frederick ~
Labarge and ‘Richard Bonacci
on the corner of Forbes Avenue
and Bouquet Street at approxi-
mately 7 p.m'..the same day.
.' He was arra'ig~neId.later‘at~~the ‘
Public Safety Building on one
count of rape. The s—uspect’s
bail was set at $10,000 with a
preliminary hearing slated for
O Oct. 24. _ " g
V “In view of the evidence,
,- however, or rather the lack of
evidence it is now our job to

prove that he raped her—some-
thing that will not by any means
be an easy job,“ Pitt Police
_ Lieutenant Hagey,_ night shift
‘ commander, said. "

-Charges have formally been’ ' 

brought against Johnson by the
victim, but the University has
no intentions of bringing forth
any additional charges of
trespassing, according to’ Ha-
gey. , .

“Taking into consideration
the seriousness-of the crime .of

The arrest came as the
culmination of a week-long

For Failureio Sched u|i9.Concert    

By JIM LEWIS

Pitt News Staff Writer

-This year’s Black Week,. begin-

ning November .13,’ won’t” have’ a
concert, and . the Black Action
Society is blaming the Pitt Union
Programming Council for the
mistake. I ’

“lt’s because of an unfortunate
mistake on PUPC’s part,” claimed
Mona Riscoe, BAS co-chairman.
“They told us a promoter was

_ going to bring ‘in Roy Ayers, but it

fell through. They didn’t check
with the agent." '

Tammy Haddad, programming
council chairman, disagrees.

“What BAS claims is. that we‘

could have called the agent and
gotten the show for November 17, ’ ’
said Haddad. “But we constantly

‘keep in touch with -the different

promoters and knew we couldn’t
get him. DiCeasare-Engler already
booked him upon conﬁrmation at
the Stanley Theater on Nov. 25.”

In an article appearingin the
October issue I of the “BAS
Forun'i,”BAS leaders claimed that
the PUPC’s policy of working
through promoters makes it “har-
der to establish a date preferable
for promoters as well as BAS.”

“They gave us only‘ one date,”
Haddad. said. ".‘That was the
problem.” _

The programming’ council of-

fered. to-bring in.D.oni1a Summer on’

, v .

BAS Blasts ProgromCommittee  

Nov. 17, but BAS:-rejectedlftlie
offer. ‘ '-

‘ ‘Donna Summer doesn’t‘ appeal
to a majority of the -black
students,” Riscoe said. -“Because
she is black, I guess PUPC thought
she would appeal to us. - But she
wasn’t on the list of possible
groups we gave them.”

One reason for the ‘lack of a
concert is a lack‘ of BAS input,
according to Riscoe. .

‘ ‘PUPC is not acknowledging our
imput, ’ ’. she claimed. ‘ ‘They’re not
respecting our opinions.”

According to Haddad, BAS— _

which accepted the formation of the
programming. council under pro-
test——is not cooperating with her
group.

“We don’t get any response
from BAS,” Haddad stated.
“They want us to do all the
work-—then they complain about
what we do.”

Student organizations dealing
with the programming council must
join together and access the
programming group’s perfor-
mance, Riscoe said. I

“All student organizations, not‘
only our group, are dissatisﬁed
with PUPC,- ” she said. “We are
going to have to get together and
decide what’s going to happen with
PUPC.”

Haddad sees no reason forsuch a .

meeting; T p‘ .-

Banks, however, require both

forces a student to wait for a refund
from the University.

A two-party check is “normally

the loans officer. “This is one way

“Part of the problem also is that

said.

Pitt and the

 Cardamone Case

 

Injured Pitt gymnast Thomas A. Cardamone en-

; ded his 24-hour wheelchair sitin in the Cathedral
Commons Room Friday afternoon after conducting
a “satisfying” meeting with Chancellor Posvar.
It was satisfying to Cardamone because he was able

to obtain some kind of assurance from Posvar that.

7 his case would be reviewed with more scrutiny by Pitt
officials. 7

The situation was quite embarrassing to Posvar,

who had addressed the Board of ‘Trustees at their fall

«meeting and dedicated the new Forbes Complex at

the same time Cardamone moved his belongings and
the local media into the Cathedral.

The Chancellor, said Cardamone after the
meeting,“is on our side. He has taken a position
now that he will do everything he possibly can.”

But as Posvar added, _“it is a legal question, and
frankly there are many details of it that I am not
aware of.” .

Cardamone’s plea for $30,000 a year for medical
expenses obviously cannot be solved by one man and
once again may be returned to the courts. This does
‘not solve Cardamone’s immediate problem. He
already has stated that he has only one month before
Social Security money, his only income, runs out,
and then he will have no place to turn. Except,
perhaps again, the Cathedral Commons Room.

The real issue is Pitt’s responsibility for its injured
athletes. Cardamone’s injury, while _unique, could in
fact happen to any of Pitt’s interscholastic or_ in-
t.-ramural athletes. When asked if the University was
liable for athletes, Posvar responded, “that’s purely
a matter for the courts to decide.”

Cardamone waited nearly 1‘/2 years for t-he Court
of Common Pleas to decide his case, and in the end
the University was found not liable. The only other
alternative was an out-of-court settlement, which,
for Cardamone, failed last year on what the Univer-
sity termed, “the question of Cardamone’s attor-

V neys’ fees.”

Cardamone, however, said this was -not the only
obstacle. University negotiators, led by Judge
Ruggero J . Aldisert, chairman of the Student Affairs

, Comfnmittee of the Board of ‘Trustees, demanded

that: no lump sum of rnoneybe offered as part of the.

settlement; past expenses, dating from October 1976
would not be paid; and, most alarming, any kind of
news leakage concerning a settlement would result in
termination of all payments.

, Given the immediacy of Cardamone’s financial
state and the length and cost of court Pfoceediflgs.
the University and Cardamone’s attorney’s should

' renegotiate an out-of-court settlement to this most

unfortunate situation.

If Cardamone loses, all of Pitt’s’ ;athleteS- lose,
because, as Cardamone said, “you’ve lost before
you’ve been injured.” And the University could find
itself in another. embarrassing situation if Car.-
damone returns to make the Cathedral “my san-
ctuary.” t

 The Alternative to T weedledee-Tweedledum

By Ron GRIFFITH

',‘ Richard Thomburgh plans to cut
waste in government. That’s the
news his running mate, William
Scranton III, brought to students‘ at
Pitt when he spoke here last week.

,The same day Pete Flaherty was
promising ‘to cut waste in govern-
ment. On a television commercial

ii that night, Flaherty also promised

to end «waste in Pennsylvania
government if he is elected and
cited his budget cuts in Pittsburgh
city government as proof thathe
can do it. . A » 
On most of the main issues in the
campaign,Flahertyan_d Thornburgh
both repeatedly spout the same
vague promises. They soundlike
the mechanical fortune-telling
woman in a penny arcade who
offers the same fortune’ for
everyone.‘ Except when ‘they
occasionally attempt rhetorically to
 each‘ others’ throats, the
Republican and ‘Democratic candi-
dates for governor‘ sound ‘more like
running ‘mates than opponents’.
‘ They both promise to end

. their

corruption, cut taxes and‘ pump

‘ some life into Pennsylvania;’s

industrial base. The two even

agree that a voluntary ceilingon '

hospital rates is better than a
mandated ceiling.

There is another gubernatorial
candidate who isn't parrotingthe
tweedledee-tweedledum" routine
fhornburgh and Flaherty have
been performing ‘since September.
Mark Zola, the Socialist Worker’s
candidate for governor, has a
different approach to the problems
Pennsylvania faces.

To Zola, big corporations and
increasing; cutthroat com-
petition in the face of 'a slow
economy are the culprits in state
problems. Zola blames such
diverse problems as layoffs in
industries and ‘declining ‘money for
state-supported colleges and ‘univ-
ersities . on the increased com-
petition, which has grown since the
recession in the early 1970’s. 1

‘‘‘There’s'' an offensive going i

H

on, claims Zola. ”an economic

offensive organized by the, people
who own the major corporations in
this country aimed at the standard

of living and the rights of working »

people—that’s women, that’s mi-

norities, that’s the entire working-

class.” -

Zola maintains he and his party
offer and alternative to Thornburgh
and Flaherty and ‘can provide a way
to start battling the offensive
‘against the working class.

“We’re running this campaign
to give and alternative to ‘these

"kinds of attacks, to be a voice for

the working people, to 0 explain
what’s happening, to get out the
idea that we have the power’ to
change things and take the
corporations headon,” says Zola.
To deal with what he considers.
the “real issue” in the campaign
for the govemor’s office—the
offensive against the working
class—Zola discusses a few topics

the other candidates never men-‘

tion. He advocates that all
institutions that receive state funds
divest themselves of stocks of
companies that have interests in

,South Africa, advocates‘ worker

control of public utilities and
supports ending the use of nuclear
power in Pennsylvania.

A There is one topic. both Flaherty

and Thornburgh constantly address
Zola -,

that Zola also opposes. ._
condemns corruption, but it’s a
different corruption than the kind
his opponents, tweedledum and
tweedledee, so faithfully condemn.

“I think there is ,a. genuine
concern among the working ‘people
in this society about the individual
corruption in politics,” he explains.

“Unfortunately, it has been
exploited byAFlaherty and Thorn-
burgh. An even more‘ fundamental
corruption is the corruption of this
whole system itself——system that
puts proﬁts before human needs,
before the safety of workers, before
the health of the entire community.

“That, to me, is’ a fundamental
kind ‘of corruption, and where it
comes from is the drive for proﬁts.
.As longas we have an economic
system that is*dominat'ed by the
corporations,‘we will have that kind
of corruption..’f .

Zola’s rhetoric is a refreshing
change from ‘the echoes of blither
repeated daily by Flaherty and
Thornburgh, but it fails to be

l

satisfying any more than ‘the
Democrats’ and Republican’ daily
drivel. -

The Socialist Workers’s Party” is
a Marxist party formed in the late
1930’s by Troskyites ousted from
the Communist Party, and Zola ex-
pertly reiterates modern Marxist
philosophy. Somehow the neat
division of the world into the bad
guys (the corporations) and the
oppressed good guys (the working
people) is too simplistic to explain

the complexities of the real world.

It’s hard to beleive so many ‘people
in the working ‘class can be duped
into supporting‘ the capitalist
system, which supposedly misuses
the workers so grievously. If they
can be so easily fooled, it seems the
Socialist Workers Party might be
tilting ‘with windmills.

For those who still’believe it is
possible to divide the world into
good guys and ‘bad guys, or can’t
stomach the mutterings of tweedle-
dum and 'tweedledee, ' Mark Zola
could be the choice for you.
Besides, it’s always more fun to
support the doomed underdog.

Yassirtand the  A

Is it not amazing that in this world

‘of publicity hypes, presidential
‘ campaigns and multi-million dollar

Madison Avenue, the United
Nations is going to spend $500,000
to promote Palestinian rights and
give a new clean image to the PLO.

- Yes sir, Yassir’s going to get a new

image, a new face, maybe even a
shave. The UN will wash him up
and polish him nice and bright for

Western (U.S.) consumption. -

I ask you this: will they be able to
wash the blood off his hands? I
mean, what kind of positive image
can you‘ give to a guy who is
responsible for terrorist murders in

» Munich, Ma’alot, Kiryat Shemona,

Tel Aviv-Haifa Highway, Rome,
Athens, Paris, Cyprus and many
more places? What nice things can
you say about a guy who does his
best to avoid armies and prefers
killing unarmed men, women and
children. How will the UN overlook
the fatal highjackings and bomb-

ings, not to mention how he walked

into the General Assembly—where
men are supposed to speak of
peace-—with a loaded pistol?

I don’t_ know, maybe there is
something positive about this latest
UN effort, but I doubt 'it.

New UHF Channel 22 Revives Old Favorites

A“ ByJIMPANE

I Don’t touch that television dial-
unless, of course, your plans include
going to class. WPIT-TV Channel

I 22,, the newest signal on the

Pittsburgh airway, offers the best in
nostalgia,‘ and its attractiveness
could keep even the 4.0 chemistry

' Tmajor from attending his favorite

lecture.

- In fact, according to station
manager Ken Buschman, WPTT is
catching the viewing eye of more
than just college students. Into its
23rd day of broadcasting, Channel
22 has received nothing but
accolades. A

‘ ‘It is difficult to judge our ratings
so soon,” says Buschman, “but the
telephone response has been
favorable. The only complaint

TheatreExpress

    ‘Outlet for New Plays

‘ By JOHN RIGHEITI

‘ “If there is no forum for new plays, there won't be any new plays,”
says Caren Harder, general manager of Theatre Express.
But, fortunately, for new plays and their authors as well as audiences

Pittsburgh: Theatre Express.

' looking for these new creations, there is a forum right here in

A AA Theatre Express, located in a new theater on Baum Boulevard, is a
professional theater company that performs a repertoire of new plays

‘I I each season. It was organized in 1975 as a touring company by Harder,

' Bill Turner, the current artistic director, and afew others. Now, Theatre
' Express is both a residential and a touring company.
‘The first theater was located in an old mattress warehouse on the
North Side. The new theater, once a rubber and retreading firm, is on
I the border of Oakland and Shadyside and is still being remodeled.
Audiences this season will be able to watch the theater go up around

them.

‘ ‘We've sandblasted and taken down hundreds of ﬂuorescent lights, ’ ’

“But there's still alot that has to be done.”

Nonetheless, the work on the‘ physical plant has not kept Theatre
Express from its exciting theatrical routine. The company this season is ’
performing six plays that cover a wide range of theater from comic opera
to drama to musicals to theater of the ridiculous. .

‘ ‘We try to keep a balance of comedy and drama, ’ ’ Harder said, ‘ ‘and

A we want to keep a focus as well."

A “Our focus this season is on new American plays. That's not to say
we’ve never ‘done others. We have done well-recognized plays and

non-American plays too.”

Theatre Express is an outlet for new plays not only in Pittsburgh but in

all of the eastern United States. It has given performances at arts
centers, colleges and universities in 16 eastern states before over 60,000
people. While touring, the company performs a few of its plays in

repertory (a different play is performed each night). This is taxing for
the actors because of the great deal of material that must be
" remembered and the necessity of switching from the character of one
play to a new character in the next. But it only -proves what excellent
and capable actors those in the company are, according to Harder.
“We've got the best company this year that we’ve ever had,” she

said.

While touring, the company offers workshops for young actors and
community people in a variety of theatrical techniques including mime, A
yoga, speech and vocal production and stage combat.

Another added attraction is the Artists’ Forum. These meetings, to be

held on designated nights after the performances, invite the audience to
stay and discuss the‘ play with the actors and director. -
Theatre Express has grown considerably since its inception. In the

’ last two years it has performed 16 plays, it has acquired a new theater,

and its budget has tripled.

“We've been really lucky,” Harder said. “Beside being supported
by the National Endowment for the Arts and the Pennsylvania'Council
on the Arts, _we receive funds from over 20 companies and foundations. ’ ’

But financial support is not enough for a theater company to survive.
Audience support is just as important. Harder believes that they have
that support here. .

‘ ‘Pittsburgh is receptive to this new and different kind of theater and I
think it will get even better,” she said. “People come here with a
preconceived notion of what a play is, butthey soon discover that a play
can be many. different things. And they must enjoy that discovery
because they keep coming back.” ‘

A That audience support is helping to make Theatre Express a theatrical

, “insurance” company. As long as Theatre Express exists, new plays

will never die.

 

Theatre Express has a new and permanent base on Baum Boulevard.

we’ve received is that our signal is
weak in a certain area in South Hills,
where a mountain is blocking the
transmission . ’ ’ A

That gripe most assuredly will be
infrequent. WPT'I‘, with its tower
situated near Murrysville, boasts
the strongest broadcast in the
area—'one. of only “six 01.‘ Seven
stations in the entire country” that
transmits on 5 million watts..

In addition, Buschman says that
in accordance with Federal Com-
munications Commission regula-
tions,_ Channel 22 soon will be
carried by major cable companies
within a 35-mile radius.

‘ A ’ sister station of WBFF-TV
Channel 45 in Baltimore, WPTT is
aiming for an audience similar to
that in the Chesapeake Bay area.

"‘We’re not coming into the
Pittsburgh market to push out the
other stations,” Buschman says.
“We're just doing things because

- its the type of programming we

know is successful, The program-
ming. we’ve established here is

._ basically the same as the one in

Baltimore, where we’ve been very
successful in our first eight or nine
years.”

The station’s program schedule is
receptive to change, Buschman
adds. He is planning a public
phone-in, during which suggestions
will be taken for possible, future
shows. For the moment, though,
WPTT’s personnel are content.

Says Stella Wolk, promotion
manager, “It’s difficult not being
affiliated with a network, but we
believe we have the best of the older
programs. The advantage of being
non-network is that our ‘program-
ming ’isn’t in continual turmoil. We
can build an audience and not
change our on-the-air look in a
rapid-ﬁre fashion. Any changes‘ we
make can be subtle.”

Here is a look at Channel 22’s
program lineup:

On weekdays, “The Three
Stooges” airs at 7 and 8 a.m. and
4:30 p_.m. “Leave it to Beaver” has
a double exposure (at 8:30 a.m. and
3:30 p.m.), as does “Dennis the

‘Stooges’ Return to TV
Despite Complaints

ByJIMPANE

‘ ‘The Three Stooges,” aftez a lengthy absence, have returned to
Pittsburgh. The antics of Moe, Larry and Curly can be seen thrice daily
(7 and 8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m.) on WPTT-TV Channel 22, one station bold
enough towipe the dust from those controversial reels.

Local viewers are enjoying‘ the ‘ ‘Stooges” for the first time since the

I ' 1960’s, when Paul Shannon, retired host of WTAE-TV Channel 4's ’

“Adventure Time,” resurrected on television the trio's unique
slapstick. Their brand of comedy has become, since the Shannon era,
both a cult and a taboo. A A A I ‘
“Many -programs have attracted a. ‘cult”—especially in college
areas-—and ‘The Three Stooges’ is one of them,” says StellatWolk,
WPT’I"s promotion manager. “The ratings of a station near Midwest

college town, for example, showed that viewership increased sharply at I

3:30, when ‘The Three Stooges’ were on, and decreased sharply at
4:00. It shows there is interest on the college level.” '

Special interest groups, however, have been‘ concerned with lower
levels, namely the pre-adolescents. Starting with the 1962 Johnson
Commission Report on violence, studies have been devoted to possible
damage done to children, who watch, say, Moe pullout Larry’s hair by
the handful while ball-peening Curly’s skull. It has resulted in many
commercial stations shying away from “Stooges” reruns.

“There have been several studies on ‘The Three Stooges,’ including
one at the University of Michigan, that show many children are less
aggressive after watching aggressive shows,” says Wolk. “But no

matter what the studies revealed, they all have been judged to be utterly A -_

‘ inconclusive. ” -

Not one of those reports have failed to include that caveat, Wolk adds,
mainly because the studies are unscientiﬁc.

“None of ' the children involved in the studies were given the
opportunity to choose the programs,” she explains. “In any setting,
conducted either by parents or more I institutionalized with

psychologists, the children were not given the freedom of -choice.”
Given that option, it was found, children often chose violence.

switched to at

“The networks have come up with some very good childreifs
programming alternatives,” says Wolk, “and (ABC’s) ‘School House
 .:k’ is a good example. ABut when they removed alot of the alleged
violence from ' '= of those Saturday morning shows, the children just
..:.ng else.” .

Wolk suggested, however, that parents ultimately should decide what
their children should watch. . '

' “It raises the question of who’s in control of the set. If you don’t want
them to see something, turn it off,” she says, “get the children to do
things as appealing (as watching violence). Anyone who sits Atheir

’ children down in front of a television and uses it as an electronic

babysitter has’ pr blems...No one will want to take the blame (if

“Once Upon A Time.‘

problems arise lat r),so the inanimate box will be the culprit.” '

Wolk, in fact, admits to the seriousness of the situation, and she says
the station is not ignoring the implications. However, station manager
Ken Buschman says WPTT will continue to air the “Stogges.”

“We will only remove it (from the program schedule) if the public
outcry is that it is too violent,” he says.‘ ‘

with swirling strings and jazzy horn-
riffs encompasses Summer’s

- vocals, and a prominent percussion

section keeps the beat constant" and
driving. '

Material is included from all her
previous albums——“Love To Love
You Baby,” “Four Seasons of
Love,” “Love Trilogy” and the ever
popular “Last Dance” from ‘ ‘Thank
God It's Friday”—but most of the
music comes from the two albums,
“I Remember Yesterday” and

Some of the more notable tracks
are “Love's Unkind” with a
profound drum hook that propels
the dance rhythms and Summer’s
dominating voice and “I Feel Love”
with" a frenetic, almost hypnotic
bass line. ‘ A

Side One is definitely the best of

the four sides. Summer whips the
exultant audience into a frenzy by

discoing from ‘ ‘Once Upon A Time’ ’ .

to “Rumour Has It” to “I Love
You.” The beat is non-stop, and the
lively pace will make the listener
play this side a ainand again. ‘
Perhaps the only drawback is her

point through being sentimental.

Defense Does the Improbable, 7-3

ByMARKMURPHY
Pin News Staff Writer
Richard Nixon was appointed
head of the Democratic National
Committee. Billy Martin left the
Yankees to become a priest. John
Wayne emigrated to the Soviet
. Union. And Pitt’s defense held
Florida State to no touchdowns. 1
You remember Pitt’s defense.
The players were last seen leaving
the ﬁeld at Notre Dame shaking their
‘heads and shrugging their should-
ers. They spent this past week

catching more ﬂak than footballs. In -

Saturday's less-than-exciting 7-3
Panther win over the Seminoles, the
defense, especially the secondary,
’ told all the detractors in the crowd of
55,104 what they could do with their
criticism. '

“Defensively, I thought the team
played extremely well, especially in
the first half,” said coach Jackie
Sherrill. ‘ ‘Anytime you hold Florida
State out of the endzone, it’s an
accomplishment. ’ ’

Seminole coach Bobby Bowden
agreed.

“I put the blame on our offense
this game—they just couldn’t do it, ’ ’
said Bowden. ‘ ‘But you have to give
the Pitt defense a lot of credit, too.
They played super, super defense.
It’s the best defense I’ve seen this
year.” p

The Panthers ﬁnally received the
big defensive play when they needed
it most. Hugh Green, Ricky Jackson
and Jeff Delaney all played their best
game of the season and helped force
Florida State" into five turnovers.

V “Everything depends on the pass
rush, and we got 5 good pass rush
today,” said ' Delaney. “Our
secondary had a lot to prove. We
have been getting a bad rap. 1
wantedto go out and really prove we

He who fumbleslast, loses. j
At least" that’s the way it
happened Saturday in Pitt’s narrow
7-3 victory over Florida State at Pitt
Stadium. With 1:44 left on the clock
and his team driving, Seminole
fullback Mark Lyles had the ball
knocked loose from his grip at the
Pitt 22 yard line, where Panther
defensive end Hugh Green recov-
ered the fumble.
‘ ‘We were in a stunt, ” Green said

The Plttdefense thwarted Florida State’s high-powered affenseisaturday.

defense that allowed nearly 600
yards and 55 points a week ago to
Mississippi State.
and an interception in the first half
might“ impress scouts from the
Turnover Bowl, but do nothing for

. the cause of victory.

“Offensively, we didn’t play that
badly except for the turnovers, ’ ’ said
Sherrill. ‘ ‘There’s no‘ excuse for the

after the game.” “and Lyles got

through the line for about five
yards. Then Ricky Jackson got a»
 good hit on him, and I got the ball.’’

The cheering that accompanied
Green's recovery proved to be the
death knell for Florida State.‘ Pitt’s
offense failed to move the ball on
the subsequent series of downs,
but, aided by a more than generous
bounce‘ downﬁeld, punter Joe
Gasparovic was able to boot the
Panthers out of trouble. His 54-yard
kick rolled dead on the Florida State

Three fumbles -

fumbles. There’s no excuse for
Ricky’s (T rocano) interception.”
Two early fumbles could have cost
Pitt the game, had not the defense
come to the rescue. On the third play
after the opening kickoff, Rooster

Jones fumbled and Arthur Scott",

recovered at the Pitt 27. A ﬁrst- down
pass from Jimmy Jordan to Mark
Lyles netted .14 yards for the
Seminoles, but the Panthers held

22 with only 38 seconds left, and .

that’s where the Seminoles stayed
until the game ended.

Lyles’ fumble capped a game that
ended with ﬁve turnovers register-
ed by Florida State and four by Pitt.

,In the ﬁrst half, the Seminoles’

“fastball” quarterback, Jimmy
Jordan, apparently hung a few
curves, three of which were
intercepted by Pitt, safeties Jeff
Delaney (2) and Mike Balzer (1).
Florida State’s other turnover came
in the third quarter, when Keith
Jones called for a fair catch on a punt
and then dropped the ball, which
was gathered-‘up by Panther Steve
Fedell. '

Pitt mistakes also came fast and
furious in the first half. Quarter-
back Rick Trocano had‘ an aerial
picked off on the Seminole one-yard
line, and running backs Ray
“Rooster” Jones and Larry Sims
coughed up three fumbles between
them—~Jones’ coming on the
Panthers’ first possession of the
game, deep in Pitt territory.

“There’s no excuse for the
fumbles and interception we had,”
Pitt coach Jackie Sherrill told
reporters. “They just kill an
offense.”

Two of Pitt’s miscues——Trocano’s
intercepted pass and Sims’ ‘second
fumble—did come with the Pan-

responsible forlthe team’s lack of
offense Saturday afternoon. The
Panthers managed - only seven
points and -297 total net yards
against a team that last week gave
up 55 points and 596‘ yards to
non-powerhouse Mississippi State.

Against a defensive secondary
reputed to be the epitome of porous,
Trocano was ableto throw for only 99
yards, 86-of them on seven passes to
split end Gordon Jones.

Defensively, Pitt gave up 331
yards to the high-powered Florida
State offense, which previously had
been averaging 415.2 yards per
game. More important, the Panther
defenders were able to come up with
the big play when -they needed it.

“The defense did an excellent,
excellent job,” Sherrill‘ said. “Any
time you hold Florida State out of the
end zone, it’s an accomplishment.
We bent, but we didn’t break.”

Safety Jeff Delaney, whose two
interceptions won him his first

V game ball in four years at Pitt, felt

the secondary had something to
prove after last week’s fourth
quarter debacle at Notre Dame.

“Nobody was cutting us a break
all week,” Delaney said. “I wanted
to go out andshow people what we
could do.” ’

While_ Jordan and backup quar-

terback Wally Woodham were able

to complete 21 of 42 passes for 220 
yards, most were short flairs to the
tight end or one of the backs, who
were usually open in the weak side

_ ﬂat. Seminole wide receiver Jackie

Flowers, who had nine catches in
each of his previous two games, was
held to only three receptions for 48
yards. _ .

“Every defense has a weak spot,’ ’
Delaney said, “and the weak side
ﬂat is ours. That’s where Notre
Dame was hitting us a lot last week.

“We knew Florida State would
pass a lot. We geared the defense to 
take away the deep out, and'we '
succeeded.’ ’

Green, who ﬁnished the game
with nine tackles, was also aware of
the Seminoles’ preference for the
pass.

“That’s all we’ worked on all
week,” he said. “We kept a lot of
pressure on them.”

A good deal of that pressure was
provided by sophomdre defensive
end Ricky Jackson, who started in A
place of Dave DiCiccio. Jackson led —-‘ "1?
the Panthers with 14 tackles,
including one sack.

And it was Jackson’s last hit on

Pitt’s soccer team had a bad day
at Grove City Saturday, as it
dropped another road contest, 3-1,
to the Grovers. The loss dropped
the Panthers’ record .to 4-6 with
four games remaining.‘

Saturday’s contest was ﬁlled
with penalties, injuries and bad
ﬁeld conditions. Because of rain
earlier in the week, the Grovers’
ﬁeld was in poor shape for soccer.

Pitt scored first when Panther

fullback Mark Nigh was fouled
within the 18-yard line and a
penalty kick was called. Sophomore
midﬁelder Johnny O’Hara scored
on the kick, and the Panthers led,
1-0.

Soon after the score, Grove City
was awarded its ﬁrst yellow card
for dangerous play. The Grovers
were on the move when Rob
Danese dribbled the ball downﬁeld
and shot. Panther goalie Scott
Thunberg came out from the box

and fell _on the ball for the save.
Before Thunberg was up from the
ground, Danese kicked him in the
abdomen. Danese received the
yellow card for dangerous play and
Thunberg received a painful groin
injury, but ﬁnished the game.

The Panthers’ momentum was
gone when the Grovers’ Jeff
Thompson scored after taking a
pass from Jack Grosset.

Control of the game then passed
from team to team until Grover Bill

A Oilers Gushing at the Thought of Thumping Steelers Tonight

By The Associated Press

If it's true that the Houston Oilers
play better againsttheir tougher
opponents, tonight’s game here
against the 7-0 Pittsburgh Steelers
might be their best game of the
season.

‘ ‘The coaching staff doesn’t'have
to say much to get the players up
for Pittsburgh,” said Joe Bugel,
offensive line coach for the Oilers.

“The thought alone seems to
bring out the best in our guys,” he
added as the two National Football

League teams prepared to renew
their American Conference rivalry.
on national television.

Houston is the only AFC Central
Division team ever to beat
Pittsburgh here since Three Rivers
Stadium opened in 1970. The Oilers

beat the Steelers here in 1970 and
1974.

“We’re getting ready, trying to
stop them, but there ain’t ‘nobody

Mental Mistakes Haunt Pantherette Spikers

ByJEFFDUROSKO
Pitt News Staff Writer
Mental errors were the cause of
the Pitt women’s volleyball team's
second-place ﬁnish at the Delaware
Invitational last weekend. Pitt
placed behind Ohio State with
Maryland and Temple third and

, fourth, respectively. The Panther-
ettes’ overall record now stands at’

22-6.

In pool play Pitt crushed all three
teams in its pool. The Pantherettes
ﬁrst defeated Immaculata College

15-5., 15-11, then beat last year’s

’ Eastern Regional runnerup,\_Rhode

Island, 15-4, 15-8. Salisbury State
was also no match for Pitt as the
spikers destroyed it 15-0, 15-4.

In the quarter ﬁnals, Pitt dropped
Navy 15-2‘, 15-8, but the real
competition began in the semi-fmals
when the Pantherettes faced
Temple. The Lady Owls won the ﬁrst
game 16-14, but Pitt came back to
win the next two and the match 15-6,
15-9.

Head coach Mike Hebert was

impressed with the comback -win
against Temple and said, “The
whole team played very well up to
that point, but we hit our peak too
early for the ﬁnals.”~

In the ﬁnals, Pitt played Ohio
State and went ahead in the ﬁrst
game 12-3, but the'Buckeyes came
back to win, 15-13. Pitt won the
second game 15-9 and in the
championship-deciding game the
Pantherettes fell behind early, 11-1 .
Pitt just couldn’t make up the deﬁcit
and ﬁnally succumbed, 15-11.

  panther Defe“nsesiIences Seminoles 

(Continued from page 12)
Another Sims fumble and Trocano’s
interception on a poorly thrown pass
to Steve Gausted ‘could not spark the
lethargic Seminole offense.

Delaney picked off his second of
two passes in the next Seminole
series, but neither offense could
mount a drive, and the teams
exchanged punts’. After a 32-yard
kick gave Pitt the ball at the 50, the
Panthers scored their game-winning
(and only) touchdown.

Pitt stayed on the ground, as
Trocano ran around the left end for
13 yards on the ﬁrst play, and
Rooster Jones cock-a-doodle-dooed
around the right side for eight more.
Fred Jacobs, the Panthers’ leading
rusher with 84 yards, carried twice to
move the ball to the 18. After two
Trocano keepers, Jacobs turned the
left corner and scooted 13 yards
untouched into the end zone. Mark
Schubert posted the last point of the
day with his extra point, and it was
7-3 at intermission.

The third period contained no
‘excitement, save for a Keith Jones
fumble that Steve Fedell recovered
at the Pitt,45. Six plays later Joe
Gasparovic punted into the end
zone. .

Starting the fourth quarter, the
Panthers b_egan_ along drive that ate
up more than six minutes on the
clock but netted no points. Trocano
went to the air during the drive and
hit the splendid Gordon Jones three
times for a total of. 41 yards. Pitt
moved from its 20 to the Seminole 22
before Jacobs was stopped for no
gain on a fourth and one.

The Seminoles had two more tries
at victory, and both efforts were so
close that the memory of the failed
ﬁeld goal haunted them. Standing "at
his 14, Jordan moved the club to
Pitt’s 16 before the defense stiffened
again.
‘Jordan to cause an incompletion,
two other passes fell short of the
mark, and Pitt took over on downs. If
Cappelen had made the 21-yarder,
FSU could have tried "a 33-yarder to
win the game.

.'iFour plays later the Panthers
punted, and Jordan almost pulled it
out. He marched the Seminoles from.
the 28 to the Pitt_25 before the day’s
last and biggest turnover squashed
any comeback hopes. Lyles took a
handoff from Jordan, ran ﬁve yards

to the 20, and then met Ricky"

Jackson. The sophomore defensive
end, who led Pitt with 14 tackles on
the day‘, hit Lyles hard enough to
