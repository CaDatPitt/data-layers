Pittsburgh
police chief
indicted for
corruption

Gideon Bradshaw
Senior Staﬁ’ Wrz'ter

Just more than a month after he
announced his resignation, federal
authorities indicted Pittsburgh Po-
lice Chief Nate Harper last Friday.
The indictment, which comes
in the midst of an FBI investiga-
tion surrounding the Pittsburgh
Bureau of Police, includes ﬁve sepa-
rate charges —— one of conspiracy
to commit theft and four of tax eva-
sion. According to the conspiracy
charge, Harper allegedly instructed
police bureau employees to misap-
ply funds received by the depart-
ment and personally rnisapplied
funds for his own use. He also alleg-
edly failed to ﬁle personal income
tax returns between 2008 and 2011,
resulting in one charge for each of
those four years.
Saturday’s indictment marks yet
another chapter in a tumultuous

month for the Pittsburgh Police

Department.

Federal investigators tookboxes
of documents from police head—
quarters on the North Side on Feb.
12. The documents included some-
from the bureau’s Special Events
Office, Which, among other du-
ties, was charged with oversight of
secondary employment -— ofﬁcers
being hired for off-duty work as
security personnel --— at the bureau.
Two days later, the investigators
took records from the Greater Pitts-
burgh Police Federal Credit Union.
Mayor Luke Ravenstahl spoke to

Administration discusses apparel-provider oversight

Gideon Bradshaw
Senior Staff Wrz'ter 1

Although one student group has the
ear of Pitt’s administration, whether
it’ll get what it wants is another mat-
ter.

Members of Americans for In-
formed Democracy, an advocacy
group active at Pitt, met with Vice
Provost and Dean of Students Kathy
Humphrey last Wednesday. The
students presented their case that
Pitt should afﬁliate itself with the
Worker Rights Consortium, a non-
proﬁt organization that monitors

working conditions at factories that
produce apparel and other products.
Over this past academic year, the
group has sought to persuade the
University that afﬁliating with the
WRC will better ensure the rights
of the workers who make Pitt’s ap-
parel, and this meeting was a step to-
ward the dialogue the group hoped
to establish with the administration.

Wednesday’s meeting was the
second to take place between Hum-
phrey and representatives from AID
and other groups in the No Sweat
Coalition, which includes AID and
other groups that wish to show

public support for the University
aﬂiliating with the WRC.

AID President Viveka Mandava
said she and other students met with
Humphrey and Vice Chancellor for
Community Initiatives G. Reynolds
Clark for the ﬁrst time six months

‘ ago. At the meeting last Wednesday,

Mandava said, Humphrey told her
and the others present that Pitt’s ad-
ministration has not yet adequately
researched the meaning of affilia-
tion with the WRC.

AID and other groups believe the
WRC will ensure safe and fair con-
ditions at factories that make Pitt’s

apparel. The University is currently
an afﬁliate of the Fair Labor Associa-
tion. Through audits, both the WRC
and the FLA monitor working condi-
tions at factories that make apparel
and other products. But Mandava
believes that the WRC does so more
objectively and better serves work-
ers’ interests. .

The University, however, doesn’t
appear ready to make a transition
in labor—monitoring ﬁrms just yet.

Pitt Spokesmanjohn Fedele said
via email that Humphrey “is listen-

ing to students’ concerns, and has scheduled
additional meetings to further our discussion.”
He said that the University had no addi-_.
tional comment. 4 _ V s ‘ '
Throughout thislast school year, AID and
other members of the No Sweat Coalition have
sought to persuade Pitt’s administration to
affiliate with the WRC. Mandava and other
members of AID said there is ample evidence
that afﬁliating with the WRC will give the Uni-
versity conﬁdence that the workers who pro-
duce its apparel do so ‘under,-fair conditions‘
and receive adequate compensation.
Mandava said thatthe FLA doesn’t provide
this guarantee.   V
Although the FLA affiliates itselfwith uni-
versities and other organizations, it also aligns
with private companies —- apparel manufac-
turers included. ‘ p
Because these private companies provide
the FLA with funds, Mandava said, a conﬂict
of interest arises. '  V _. .   A — ’
Mandava said the WRC receives its funding
entirely from non-governméhtal organiza-
tions and from universities.
“We feel very conﬁdent in terms of our

estimation of the WR ,” she said. “We are
willing to work with [University oﬂicials] to
ensure that they have all the facts so they can
make a decision.” 1

Last October, Heeral Coleman, the FLA’s

“We feel   , verayfc  

conﬁdentin our
estimation of the
[Worker Rlghil-:S.:,,

Consortiu   ‘  

t=i..Viveka Mandava

director of communications and outreach,
told The Pitt News that the FLA requires all
companies that a.fﬁliate,with it to monitor

conditions at the facilities that manufacture 1

their products. ’   _:.-_.
Mandava said that-when auditors for the
WRC monitor conditions at a factory, it in-

terviews workers away from the job site. Ac-

cording to Mandava, those who conduct the
FLA’s audits do not. _

Aaron Pickering, the FLA’s'communica-
tions manager, said recently inan email that
the FLA leaves the decision on whether to
interview workers at the site or elsewhere up
i to the discretion of the auditors.

‘ i'.'Mandava said that members of AID have
thoroughly researched the WRC and what
they believe are its comparative advantages.

, Michael Wooley, the group’s secretary, has

written a research paper on the subject that
is more than 40 pages in length and includes
almost 150 citations.

Members of AID have delivered copies of
the paper to Humphrey’s ofﬁce, as well as to
Clark’s and Chancellor Mark Nordenberg’s
ofﬁces./The group has also posted a copy of
the paper on the No Sweat Coalition’s website.

Though Mandava is already convinced that
her group has ample evidence, she empha-
sized that the group was willing to continue

. to work with the University to make its case

for afﬁliation with the WRC. She said that AID
does its homework when it prepares state-

‘ ments for the University or broader public.

“We want to make sure that the informa-
tion behind [our argument] is factual and

correct,” she said. “That it isn’t sensational-
ized.” I

on Feb. 21. When he left, he announced that
he would ask Harper to resign immediately.

According to court documents, Harper,
who had served as police chief since October

2006, and other police employees with whom

he conspired took funds that private compa-
nies and other organizations paid to the police
bureau’s Special Events Office in order to hire
off—duty police officers as security under the
secondary—employment program. V
According to the indictment, Harper
allegedly conspired with at least seven un-
identiﬁed others to set up a Pittsburgh Police
Federal Credit Union account named “I.P.F.”
and used debit cards for another named “Spe—
cial Events.” They deposited funds from the
secondary-employment program into these
credit union accounts, later using debit cards
to make unauthorized withdrawals of funds,
according to court documents. .
The charges contend that Harper instruct-
ed the other police employees to misapply
$70,628.92 from the secondary-employment
program between Julyv2008 and November
2012. Harper also allegedly personally mis-
applied $31,986.99 for his own use between
September 2008 and December 2012. -
Among the 14 payments that the court
documents list as having wound up in the un-
authorized accounts was a payment that Pitt
made on Sept. 16, 2009, for $5,675.52 in order
to hire security for its mobile science lab.
The indictment also listed various with-
drawals “for his own personal use” from 10-
cations such as Macy’s for perfume and gift
cards and Jerome Bettis Grille for food and

alcohol. — 8

Harper also allegedly failed to pay taxes for
at least $470,000 in gross income between
the years 2008 and 2011.

According to a press release from the U.S.
Attorney’s Office for the district of Western

1 Pennsylvania, which is prosecuting the case

onbehalf of the federal government, Harper
faces a total sentence of up to nine years in
prison, a ﬁne of $650,000 ‘or both.

How to enhance the greatness of the OCC
and vanquish the naysayers: A proposal

 Matt Schaff
Columnist

The Outside the Classroom Cur-
riculum, a paternalistic scheme
that corrupts people’s incentives,
demeans human potential, de-
grades the value of a Pitt degree
and overall defrauds students of
tuition dollars in the sustenance of
a useless program  right?
Wrong. The brainchild of Dean
of Students Kathy Humphrey, the
OCC, could actuallybe unambigu-
ously useful -— that is, for a small
number of marginal, truly sad in-
dividuals.
For everyonecl know who com-
’ pleted the OCC, the program failed
in its stated mission. They would
say otherwise, but don’t let that
distract you: Every member of the
OCC Honorary Society would have
been well—rounded and involvedton
campuswithout green sweatshirts,
green cords, deluxe breakfasts and
special access to employers push-
ing them along. V
Far from stimulating the “whole
studen ” or providinga“systematic
way to develop yoursel ,” the OCC
serves mostly as an external recog-
nition device, providing adminis-
trative back—patting for the same
kinds of activities that students
once completed with only intrinsic

motivation (such as attending the
opera, Pitt Make a Difference Day
or basketball games). As Robert
Beecher, chair of the Student Gov-
ernment Board’s Governmental Re-
lations Committee, said on WPTS

radio before spring break, “You’ve .

done so many of these things al-
ready, why not go ahead and com-
plete it and get the beneﬁts?”

So it’s not that the OCC of-
fers zero beneﬁt for the already-
involved student: Padding egos
with Humphrey’s approval, resu-
més with another credential and
stomachs with free, tuition-funded
food could all be a good thing. But
the OCC cannot achieve its stated
objectives with any student who
already gets out of bed in the morn-
ing: .It’s just not going to increase
well-roundedness, at least as far as
we can measure.

The OCC is not a focused in-
centive scheme directed toward a
public-health concern like smok-
ing or toward an environmental
concern like recycling. It rides on
much grander ambition, grander
even than those of Pitt’s academic
schools: to build within people ev-
erything it means to be a “studen ,”
a word that in education’s case is
nothing but proxy for “human be-
ing.”

Here’s the OCC in a nutshell:

Cartoon by Nick Stamatakis

Satisfy requirements in 10 areas,
and voila, you are a well—rounded
student — a “whole” human being.
We should be deeply suspicious of
any effort like this. Forcing the ex-
panse of human potential into tidy
categories is an exercise fraught
with peril and doubt. We shouldn’t
trust anyone who tries, be they hu-
manist scholars or non-academic
administrators such as Humphrey.

Even if student input buttresses
and streamlines the categories, as
in the recent changes to the OCC re-
quirements, the categories inevita-
bly faﬂ to account for all the nuance
that makes us “whole;” they will
assign too much weight to some
things, not enough to others, and
none to what could be essential to
“wholeness.” According to the OCC
mindset, if all the art you “appre-
ciate” during college comes from
Hollywood studios, or if working
two jobs to pay tuition keeps you
from attending an event offered
by the Cross-Cultural Leadership
Development Center, you are less
whole (and ineligible for the green
cord).

Thus, the OCC claims the impos-
sible power to compare students’
humanity. In reality, all the OCC
does is compare whether students

say they participated in activities that happen
to appear on a certain list. The OCC claims
distinction where none exists: Once a student
walks outside, he is no more or less “whole”
or “rounded” than a student who drowns
himself in a sea of campus responsibilities.

So if not to determine who’s “whole” and
who’s not, why have the OCC? The division of
Student Affairs, which administers the OCC,
sure seems committed to convincing us of
its value — note the flashy graphics and the
recent promotional videos ﬂush with student
actors speaking from scripts.

« For one, the OCC could increase the use
of Student Affairs services. At a time when
tuition rates and student debt levels spiral
upward and when governmental appropria-
tions dangle in uncertainty, universities feel
pressure to cut costs, and administrators
must then justify their programs (Pitt spent
almost $120 million on student services in
2012). Popularity can be powerful justiﬁca—
tion: If you offer students cookies (let’s say
recognition and credit) to participate in ser-
vices offered by your campus oﬂice, students
will likely participate more, and you will eas-
ily convince the University to maintain your
funding level. Is it then any surprise that the
OCC core requirements explicitly list no less
than 17 services and opportunities through
Student Affairs?

Another reason to have the OCC, so Stu-
dent Affairs argues, is job opportunities. Of
course, this cou1dn’t mean boosting students’
chances at employment after graduation —
if the credential actually had market value,
don’t you think the underlying activity would
be monitored, like for a real degree? (Stu-
dents can log on to the OCC website and attest
to what they’ve achieved without oversight).
Instead, the sure—ﬁre j ob opportunities that
the OCC creates apply to Student Affairs em-
ployees, all by the aforementioned pathway
of reinforced participation.

So with practically everyone who com~
pletes the OCC no more “whole” or employ-
able thanks to it, the program fails in its pri-

mary mission. But perhaps the program just .

isn’t catering to the right audience. Unless

we want the OCC to go down in history as
no more than a personal record of campus
involvement with perks, we must rebrand it.
As a fresh start, we should push the OCC
as a welfare program for the few students
who could help the OCC fulﬁll its mission:
Those who are marginally, debatably human.
I’m talking about zombies, vampires and
those of us who, despite normal capacities,
lack interest in doing anything other than
staring at blank walls.
Otherwise, of course, the OCC is com-
pletely superﬂuous. I

should construct as he checks boxes on the

Rap music promotes summer behavior, has sunny roots

By now, confused birds are incessantly chirp-
ing outside of academic buildings wonder-
ing, like the rest of us, why the sun chooses
to forget about this modest city nestled at
the joint of three rivers.

Winter’s frostbitten charm is short lived,
and in the case of Pittsburgh’s current ordeal,
really old. Luckily, brighter skies and shiver-
less walks through Oakland are around the
corner. In a few short weeks, venturing out-
side won’t necessitate a parka or boots and
we’ll all stop feeling sad from the weather.

If you were to give music a meteorological
association, chances are most rap albums
would fall into the “sunny” column. Rap has
a way of inspiring outdoor activities and gen-
eral upbeatness. So as winter ends and hap-
piness becomes a more common response to
looking out the window, here are some songs
to make the most of the warmer days ahead.

“Between Friends” by Captain Murphy ft.
Earl Sweatshirt

Flying Lotus’ production on this song
brings vinyl—record warmth into this soni-
cally unique track, and it doesn’t hurt that
Earl Sweatshirt shows up to deliver dizzy-
ingly complex bars perfect for front-porch
lurking and sing—alongs.

“Are You That Somebody?” by Aaliyah
This song is simply a classic. Timbaland’s
ﬁnest beat, Aaliyah’s vocals and the chorus
—— there’s no way not to have a sunny day
when you’ve sung “Sometimes I’m goody-
goody / right now naughty-naughty” at least

   
   

OIICE.

“Wamp Wamp (What It Do)” by Clipse
This song went wildly underappreciated
in the southern rap takeover period of hip-
hop, when rappers like Paul Wall and Slim
Thug were imprinting on every regional
movement in the country. Here we get the
just—as—underappreciated Clipse, featuring
the boss hog outlaw himself, Slim Thug, mak-
ing for one of the most fun choruses in rap.

itty Pryde is a good choice for summer rap music becuase of her hopeful sound.

“0rion’s Belt” by Kitty Pryde

Kitty Pryde is originally from Florida, so
she might inadvertently emanate vitamin
D. Whatever it is, there’s something hope-
ful about this song. The arrestingly bouncy
drum loop and lines like “rap game Taylor
Swift,” make this song a must.

“Portrait in Black and Blue” by King Krule
UK producer King Krule has been called

“trip-hop” by some. “Portrait in Black and
Blue” ﬁnds the producer taking the doom
and gloom of winter and setting it to a bom-
bastic drum beat that ﬂips the winter—time
blues on its head.

“3hunna” by Chief Keef
This song might actually be the perfect
expression of id-ﬁieled rowdiness. Chief Keef

ture her own spotlight outside of the Steel
City.

“Everyone I touch turns to gold, and
then I’m still stuck here by myself,” she said.
“Everyone has their turn, and mine is still
coming.”

Developing as an artist

Once Krakow returned to the U.S. in Sep-
tember 2011, she jokingly rapped the lyrics
of her new ballad over Wiz Khalifa’s “Black
and Yellow” in the basement of her friend
Tim Shefiler, also known as D] Shef, who is
the signed DJ for rapper Boaz. Throughout
Krakow’s career, Sheffler helped her by giving
advice, recording her songs and producing
and burning her mixtapes. Once the audio
was rolling, Krakow decided to call Cornelius

Henke to direct and produce a video to ac-‘

company her music.

Henke is a childhood friend of Krakow’s,
and they reconnected through the Pittsburgh
rap scene. Henke worked with some videog-
raphy for The Govament, a Pittsburgh-based

rap group, and reunited with Krakow when
she danced in their Video “Puffin on the Purp”
in 2007. Henke frequently contacted Krakow
when he needed a backup dancer, and in re-
turn, he said that he would assist her with

~ her own video.

After working on the project for a few
months, Krakow uploaded her ﬁrst music
video, titled “Pound On My Mufﬁn,” to You-
Tube on Dec. 25, 2011.

Locations such as Highlander Pub on
Highland Avenue, Krakow’s house and Schen-
ley Park make appearances in the video. The
“muffin girls” — Krakow’s backup dancers
—— featured in the “Pound On My Muffin”
video are her friends, who frequently appear
in her other videos. They are not paid for the
work on the videos, and Krakow avoids other

out-of—pocket costs by writing her own lyrics -

and choreographing her own dance moves.
She also designs costumes for the videos
by herself‘, and her mother assists with sew-
ing and props. Krakow acknowledged how
fortunate she is to have friends who are vid-
eographers, and her success can be heavily

kow said. “They think, ‘This girl is going to
somewhere, and we want to go with her.”’

After the release of “Pound On My Muf-
ﬁn,” Krakow earned revenue from her song
through iTunes and Google, and she also
gained a Canadian fan base from a two—day
radio show on The Edge — a popular radio
station in Canada.“

But only two days after her ﬁrst video
dropped, Krakow was involved in a serious
car accident that resulted in several broken
and sprained bones. Her career suffered a
hiatus as a result, and Henke believes that
if she had been able to tour, she would have
gained more publicity for her other songs.

‘ “Krakow’s other songs, including “Sticky
Icky,” “Keys Purse Phone” and “Pimp Pretty,”

' aim to attract women from the ages of 16 to

35 with relatable, catchy lyrics and dance-
ablembeats. . V o

she said. “That’s not what I, as an artist, am
aiming for.” V

MUFFIN

A provocative persona

Krakow has received mixed feedback on
the “shock factor” that she strives to create
in her image. Blogs including The Hufﬁngton
Post’s compare her to one—hit Youtube sensa-
tion Rebecca Black, and both comedy—show
host Daniel Tosh and celebrity-gossip blogger

-‘ Perez Hilton mentioned her breakthrough

video.

The comments on her YouTube video are
an entirely different ball game. While the
video currently boasts over 1,500 likes, it also
carries over 8,000 dislikes; Top comments

include “I’m....Scared for humanity...” and
“Those are cupcakes, not muffins.”

In the video, the muffin girls do, in fact,
provocatively dance around icing—topped
baked goods rather than the traditional muf-
ﬁn. Producer and director Henke said that
the slip-up could not have been executed any
better. He admitted to hysterical laughter
when Krakow returned from the bakery with
cupcakes rather than mufﬁns, but he believes
that the fortuitous mistake paired with “half-
ass editing” helped attract more viewers.

“Shira’s video really made me enjoy the
craft of music-video directing again,” Henke
said. “Any other video I did, usually people
take themselves way too seriously.”

Krakow’s videographer, Louis Barr, also
applied the “any publicity is good public-

PITT PROJECT OAKiAND+

ity” motto to the white female rapper. He
said that Krakow remained bold and brave
in the face of negative comments, and her
“hatertainment” approach still encourages
conversation about her, which led to radio
interviews and performance opportunities
at local nightclubs, including Diesel in the
South Side and Savoy in the Strip District.

“People are sharing [her video] and people
are having a good time talking about it,” Barr
said. “That is the role of an entertainer.”

As for Krakow, she keeps in mind that she
is an entertainer. Even though she created her

rapper persona — often using profanity and_

wearing undergarments — Krakow said that
it is “not real.” Krakow explained that she
emulates artists such as Beyonce, a popular
performer who has created the alter-ego Sa-

when performing on the stage.

“My home life and life on the screen are
not the same,” she said. “The audience has a
hard time differentiating between the two.”

In her ﬁnal year at Pitt, Krakow will con-
clude all of her major classes at the end of
the semester and believes that the theater
program and her acting coach, Ken Bolden,
have improved both her auditioning and

performance skills. Additionally, she will be .

Pitt sweeps ﬁrst Big East opponent over weekend

Nate Barnes
Senior Staﬁ‘ Wrz'ter

Pitt baseball made history once again in what’s
been a successful start to its 2013 campaign.

Having handed Wichita State its ﬁrst sweep
at home in 43 years to open the season, this
past weekend Pitt rolled into Queens, N.Y., and
swept St. John’s in its own ballpark — the ﬁrst
time such an event has happened to the Red
Storm in 17 years.

Pitt (15—6, 3-0 Big East) opened Big East play
powerfully, scoring 37 runs in three games to
sweep the defending Big East tournament cham-
pions. In addition to the wins, two Pitt players,
juniors Matt Wotherspoon and Stephen Vranka,
were named to the Big East Weekly Honor Roll
for their performances over the weekend.

But Coachjoejordano said he doesn’t take
much from the sweep in the scope of the entire
season. Instead, he focused on howthe Panthers
played over the weekend.

“Itis avery long season, andl don’tbelieve it
says anything other than we played solid base-
ball in all phases,” Jordano said. “We pitched
well, we played tremendous defense and had
some ﬁmely hitting.”

Pitt 12, St._]ohn’s 9

Pitt required a comeback in its ﬁrst Big East
game of the season after the Red Storm jumped
out to a 3-0 lead early in the contest at Jack
Kaiser Stadium on Friday. The Panthers then
scored four runs inthe top of the fourth to take
a one-run lead.

Stephen Vranka (21) had much succes at the late against St. John’s. Nishnt Sg |

In the following inning, Boo Vazquez cracked
his ﬁrst long ball of tlie season to right-center

ﬁeld to give his team a 5-3 lead.

But inthe bottom half, St.John’s scored two

runs to tie the contest at 5-5.

Florida

Jasper Wilson
Assiszfant Sports Editor

The location of Pitt gymnastics’ NCAA region-
al was announced Monday. The University of
Florida will host Pitt and four other schools in
Gainesville, Fla., on April 6. The event is the
team’s ﬁrst NCAA appearance since 2007.

One of 36 schools to qualify nationally and
one ofsix that will compete at its regional, Pitt“
earned an auto—bid by virtue of its third-place‘
ﬁnish at the East Atlantic Gymnastic League
meet over the weekend. The Panthers have faced
three of their ﬁve regional opponents already
this season: No. 12 Auburn University, the Uni-
versity of Bridgeport and the No. 24 University
of Maryland.

“We’ve worked really hard to earn this bid,”
head coach Debbie Yohman said in a press re-
lease. “Any of my kids who have advanced to a
region as an individual in the past few years will
tell you that they would give anything to go as a
team, instead. And now, they have that chance. I
This is going to be a great competition and a
great experience for our program.”

The team will need to ﬁnish ﬁrst or second
to advance to the NCAA Championships begin-
ning April 19. ﬂ

Softball storms to back-to—ack ictories over St. John's

Megan Boyle
Staﬁ" Wrz'ter

With the sun ﬁnally shining in Pittsburgh, the
Pitt softball team played its ﬁrst conference
game this weekend against St.John’ . Not only
was this an important series for the team’s
record, it was also the home-opener for the
Panthers. The team took Vartabedian Field
on Saturday for game one of the three-game
series and got off to a slow start, but managed
to rebound and win the series against the
Red Storm, 2-1.

“It’s great to win the series  I was really
proud of them.” Head coach Holly Aprile said.

St._]ohn’s 5, Pitt 3

On Saturday, Ellen Czuba of St. John’s
scored early in the ﬁrst inning, giving the
visitors the advantage. But Pitt quickly re-
sponded with a home run from senior catcher
Holly Stevens in the bottom of the ﬁrst to tie
the game. It was Stevens’ 33rd career home
run, and she currently holds the record for
most career home runs in program history.

Despite Stevens’ success, however, the Red

Storm broke away from the Panthers in the
fourth inning. After two RBIs that made the
score 4-1, St. John’s never gave up their lead.

“We weren’t stringing together as many
hits,” freshman outﬁelder Tori N irschl said.

 

“We weren’t taking advantage of our oppor-
tunities.”

But the Panthers still put up a ﬁght. In the
bottom of the ﬁfth inning, Nirschl sent two
of her teammates home to bring the contest

  

to its ﬁnal score of 5-3.

Pitt 3, St.John’s 2 (8 innings) ..

With one game already played and victory
not yet achieved, the Panthers were ready
to come back and get a win — which was
exactly what they did. Senior Holly Stevens
put it simply. ‘

“We had to win, we just couldn’t lose,” _
she said. 7

The Panthers had a slow start, with St.
_]ohn’s scoring a tvvo-run home run in the
top of the fourth. The team responded in the
sixth inning when Tori Nirschl hit a home run
off the ﬁrst pitch she saw, which inched the
Panthers closer to victory. An inning later;<:-
center ﬁelder Carly Thea hit an RBI single to
tie the game up and send it into extra innings.

With Pitt up to bat with two outs, the at-
tention was on sophomore Kaila Balatgek
as she stepped up to the plate — and she
didn’t disappoint. She slammed a line drive»,
to right center ﬁeld that sent a player home V
and ended the game.

LA GRAIN or SAUL

VVhen it comes to sports, fans stay busy in the month of March

Isaac Saul
Senior Staff Wrz'ter

The month of March is like a ﬁne strip steak
for sports consumers.

There is nothing better. You get the NCAA
basketball tournament, NFL free agency and
draft hype, the ﬁnal stretch of the NBA regular

V season, the NHL entering its ﬁnal stretch and

the MLB spring training kickoff.

It’s hard to focus on just one sport with all
this going on. So I’ve decided to try and cover it
all. Here is my it’s—March—and-I—can’t—choose—
what-to—write-about quick hits.

NCAA Basketball
Now is the time when everyone starts drool-

ing over what could have been in his or her _

tourney bracket. After 24 games, only one of
the 8.15 million brackets entered on ESPN.
com’s Tourney Challenge was ﬂawless. That
1 ‘bracket had Georgetown in the Final Four, who
would go on to lose to No. 15 Florida Gulf Coast

in its ﬁrst game.

I bet on N.C. State, using some rationale
that I can’t seem to remember now — but a
lot of people who are riding Duke, Louisville
and Ohio State are still in pretty good shape.

So is there any progress on discovering a
rhyme or reason to the bracket? Short answer:
no. Longer answer: deﬁnitely not.

NFL

Newsﬂash: If you are a veteran stud, don’t
think that means your team’s management will
show you loyalty! Ed Reed is a Texan and Brian

Urlacher will not be returning to the Bears. It’s '

rare that you see two future hall- of-fame play-
ers leave the teams they’ve played on for their
entire careers — but after the Colts let Peyton
Manning go, there isn’t much that surprises me.
Add to that the way the Steelers handled
James Harrison, the Patriots let Wes Welker
walk out, Anquan Boldin got traded and Adrian
Wilsonwas cut and you’d be hard pressed to ﬁnd
evidence of any loyalty left in the NFL.

The Baltimore Ravens, fresh off their Super
Bowl win, pretty much decimated their roster
before signing Elvis Dumervil this week. Their
lack of ability to re—sign probably has something
to do withjoe Flacco’s record—breal<ing season

and also with professional athletes’ tendencies '

to chase money immediately after winning.

NBA .

Not sure if you’ve heard, but the Miami Heat
are good. Like, really good. Like, I’m not con-
vinced they’ll lose another game this season.

If you’ve had the pleasure of watching them
play more than once this season, you know one
thingfor certain: LeBron]ames is unstoppable
right now. There is literally no solution for cov-
ering him. It won’t be long before people drop
all of the Michaeljordan comparisons and just
start talking about LeBron compared to himself.

There are 29 other NBA teams all potentially
worth talking about — until you remember
none of them have a chance to win the NBA
title this year.

NHL

After the slowest start in his NHL career,
Alex Ovechkin as we know him is back. The
Washington Capitals superstar scored in all four
of the Capitals’ games last week, recording ﬁve
goals and three assists in all.

Meanwhile, Pittsburgh is quickly forgetting
about the Steelers in the wake of the Penguins’
12—game winningstreak.Asifthatweren’t sweet

V enough, the 12th win of that streak came over

their cross-state rival, the Philadelphia Flyers.

MLB

A Major League Baseball season consists -

of 162 games played over 180 days. On top of
the regular season, the league actually tele-
vises and covers an additional, meaningless
spring-training season. The result is a measly
4-month breakfrom baseball between October
and February.

You expect me to start talking about it now?

seventh, Steven Shelinsky Jr. hit his seventh
home run of the season, a three-nm bomb to
right ﬁeld that put Pitt up for good at 8-5.

St. John’s got one run back in the bottom of

r the seventh, but Pitt responded with four runs

A in the eighth — two coming on a Casey Roche
single. The outburst of offense effectively sealed
the win for the Panthers.

The timely hitting was somethingjordano
saw as abig reason for the team’s weekend suc-
cess.

“We were very disciplined at the plate and
came up with some big hits,”Jordano said.

the outcome of Saturday’s matchup was never

Pitt already held a 7-0 lead.

Pitt took advantage of multiple Red Storm
errors to score six runs in the top half of the
inning with ﬁve runs coming in and two outs
already recorded. ’

On the mound, Wotherspoon was dealing
ﬁre all game long. Wotherspoon (4-1) pitched
the second complete game of his career and
gave up two runs on seven hits while striking
out six batters.

With the bullpen somewhat depleted due

«a - to injuries,Jordano needed his starters to take

some of the load off the relievers and pitch deep
into games during the St. John’s series.

“We are currently a little banged up, so we
went into St.John’s understaffed. But our start-
ers didagreat job forus, and the penwas equally

, effective,” he said.

Pitt 11, St._]ohn’s 2
For the second consecutive game, the
Panthers received a solid performance on the

mound to hold the Red Storm to onlytwo runs
on Sunday. Meanwhile, the offense put in an
impressive performance.

Rhys Aldenhoven (4-0) stayed perfect on
the mound as he went seven innings allowing
just two runs — one earned — on six hits. The
Australian also struck out three.

Jonathan Danielczyk and Pete Macke ﬁn-

ished the game on the mound, allowing only ,

one hit over the ﬁnal two innings to prevent
the Red Storm from trying to mount any sort
of late resistance. 5
Vranka led the charge for the Panthers at the
plate. Vranka capped off a weekend in which he

went 6-11 with a 3-5 day at the dish and drove '

intwo runs.

Boo Vazquez played a big partin Pitt’s offnsive onslaught over the weeked.‘ Nishant

Vranka, originally hitting lead-off for the
Panthers, dropped to the No. 7 slotinthe lineup
for the weekend’s series at St.John’s. Thejunior
entered the weekend hitting just .153 andhaving
more strikeouts than hits.

But moving him to a lower rung in the or-
der paid off for Jordano’s squad, as Vranka
was named to the Big East Weekly Honor Roll
Monday alongside Wotherspoon for their per-
formances. Q ’

“Steve is a dynamic player,”Jordano said. “I
just believed that movinghim down inthe lineup
would take a little of the pressure off and allow
himto be more effective. We needed some more
production inthe seven—thr,ough-nine spot and
he has given that to us.” I

“Kaila Balatgek had a great day, in general.
And that hit, that’s hard not to stand ou .”
Aprile commented on the game-winning hit
that sent in ﬁrst baseman Savannah King to
score.

Nirschl’s home run in the sixth inning was
her seventh home run this season. She leads
the team in that statistic this season. Also,
sophomore pitcher Alexa Larkin recorded

13 strikeouts, surpassing her career high of
10 strikeouts in a single game.

Pitt 6, St.]ohn’s 3

The Panthers wanted to build off that col-
lective performance when they stepped up to
play Sunday afternoon against St.]ohn’s in the
ﬁnal game of the series. They came out strong
with three home runs scored in the bottom of
the second inning. Balatgek, Carmelena Moifa
and pinch hitter Taylor Henry each accounted
for a long ball in that inning.

“It just added to the energy of the team and
the excitement. As a pitcher, it makes me feel
good because I know my team is supporting
me. They’re behind me,” Larkin said.

That offense gave Larkin a cushion to work
with, and she obliged, keeping the momentum
going by shutting out the opposition through
ﬁve innings. Pitt racked up three more runs
in the bottom of the ﬁfth, making the score
6-0. The Red Storm quickly responded at the
top of the next inning when shortstop Erin
Burner hit a two—run home run to make the
game an interesting 6-3. But with a Pitt pitch-
ing change, King came on the mound to stop
the comeback and gave no room for St.]ohn’s
to gain any more ground. The performance
earned King her second save of the season.

Pitt’s next series will be played this week-
end at DePaul. H -
