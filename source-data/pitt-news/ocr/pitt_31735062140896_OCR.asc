e Must Clsange . .
‘ Sunday, a new service ﬂag will ‘be dedicated to the stu-
it, ’ ; faculty members, and alumni who are or have been in ,

rhea service. We use the two tenses of the verb because

»

‘Service ﬂag will boast two stars, one blue and one gold. The

Yer is representative of those nowparticipating in the
r, the latter is representative of those who have given up
jiriilives in order’ that an abstract liberty called democracy

(ht “hot perish from the earth.’’ .   t
 According to most recent calculations, over 3500 persons
‘nected with the University are participating in the second
- ‘orld War. Before the battles are over many more will do'n
kliaki, navy blue, and marine green. Perhaps now we will
' glize that big things are happening. But in another sense the
of a brother or a close friend may bring this realization

‘encloser to home.

 Soon, very soon, all must feel that a crisis is at hand.
Soon, all must discover that the Japanese is a cool, treacher-
ous; formidable enemy’ trained from boyhood in the manly
art of. death’. Soon, all must realize that the Tunisian cam-
paign is more than a melodramatic, romantic struggle be-
tween two armies of knights in. tanks. _ A
 However abstract liberty may be, the knowledge of thous-
_sjof Poles shot because they dared to re—seek it, and the
aths of Greeks too proud to admit defeat should stir all of
with the thought that it is either with guns and money or
t;ecumb- to one of the greatest war machines the world has
liter known. Whatfollows -in the aftermath ofdefeat is well

wn to all of us.

A b - Over 3500 alumni, students, and faculty are in the armed
“iaerfvices. They need supplies and", in cases, blood.
’ Today at the University there is a bond drive. The suc-
S‘ or failure of this campaign will determine whether we
re really all out for war or. whether we are satisﬁed toglet

 3500 carry all of the brunt by themselves.

. “This drive is important. It must be ﬁnished successfully.
thout a doubt both Berlin and Tokyo are very interested
how our 13 billion war bond solicitation will turn out.
ually as interested are the 3500 scattered over the world
their foxholes and on their salt-washed decks. ‘

H When the service ﬂag is hung for all to observe, the sight

 it

should daily bring to our m‘inds”the absence of classmates
,<”r}:fd,.instructors. It should also bringto our minds the thoughts ’

soon we will be: joining them or in some other way aiding
em‘. But most of all it must make us- realize that the world
rapidly changing and that we must change if we are to sue-

"I}itt’s Department of Fine Arts

‘hinese ceramic art, loaned by C. T.

ongof its kind in this city and has

, y to‘ be’ held in Pittsburgh this
g0 \
g , ntion has been given to show
is. -various stages in the process
if the ceramic arts from prehistoric
es up through the Sung period.
s "a medium in which China has
 n rgpreeminent, care has been
 en to emphasize the cultural
is “kground so important in deter-
ining forms, designs, and glazes.
-‘;‘To emphasize the Taoist inﬂu-
Chinese esthetic ideal so evident
nearly designs, a selection ‘of
paintings has been included. Thus‘
onesees the Chinese delight in
symbolic and fantastic animals
‘ din the beauty of nature, re-
Igected in their painting as well as
in“ their ceramics. In the exhibition
one may note interesting com-
parisons such as in a hill jar of

jieath a misty landscape. A water
ufalo in Tzu Chou ware, de-
signed for a scholar’s desk, mani-

fests much the same spirit as is
seen in two’ paintings of water
buffaloes of‘ the herd boy series.
The exhibit includes a very un-
usual bit of ceramic sculpture in an
unglazed clay ﬁgure of a man, which
‘inthe subtlety and delicacy _of the
modeling suggests the high attain-
ment in ﬁgure‘ ‘sculpture before the
Greco-Buddhist inﬂuence. A

Although the inﬂuence of the

Buddhist tradition is not so promi-

nent in the exhibition, the drapery

folds of .a Wei ‘ﬁgure are similar
to those in a pair of donors holding
lotus ﬂowers in Wei bronze, which
in turn reflect the great art of the
cave sculptures. These are repre-
sented more directly in-the exhibit

by rubbings.

mic. Problems

  To Pitt New '5 Inquiring Reporter Felclman

.-

In consideration of the inevitable
economic problems of the post-war
world, the Pitt New’s inquiring re-
porter has interviewed Russell A.
Dixon, associae professor of, eco-
nomics.

The leading problem we will face

" . after this war will be to “Convert

high war productivity into civilian
instead of military use. Our war
productivity is certainly higher
than the greatest peace productiv-
ity of the past. If we can convert

_ this tremendous rate of production

'1

to civilian use every other problem
facing us will become relatively
insigniﬁcant.”.

“And, if we cannot?”

“I can't say deﬁnitely. It seems
very probable that vast unemploy-
ment and a. ﬁnancial breakdown
would occur.”

‘fBut do not the national debt and
the great destruction. of private
property create a great problem un-
den‘ any circumstances?”

“No, the national debt is not an

I actuality. It is merely a bookkeep-

ing problem. Moreover, it is so
widely distributed that it will be
diﬂicult for a few individuals to
seize control of it. The capacity to
pay back the debt depends on the
power of the government to tax
national wealth. If the war is fol-
lowed by great productivity, and

therefore wealth,'debt will be rela-
tively insigniﬁcant.”

“Destruction is also compara-
tively trivial as long as men, tech-
nology, and ra wmaterials remain.”

“War has certain economic ad—
vantages; it sweeps away barriers
to the utilization of resources and
advanced technology; economy is
made functional rather than proﬁt-
seeking. Today the function of our
economy is to create the materials
for winning the war rather than to
create wealth for individuals. After
the war economy must continue on
a functional basis, TO SERVE SO-
CIETY RATHER THAN SELFL We
must produce and distribute useful
forms of wealth to as many per-
sons as possible. The ideology of
personal gain must be greatly
modiﬁed.”

“If the basis for production is
the widest possible use rather than
proﬁt, the amount of production will
increase and-thus eliminate the un-
empoyment problem. Great wealth
naturally follows high productivity
and if this program is carried out
the obvious result will be the great-
est production of wealth in our his-
tory.”

_“That sounds good, but how can
the people be convinced?”

“War reconstructs as well as
breaks down thought patterns, as

history will demonstrate. Today
people are beginning to believe that
security is more important than
gain. In addition, they are becom-
ing reconciled to the functional pat-
tern of our war economy.”

“On the other hand, war creates
a false feeling of self-sufficiency.
We are new building synthetic rub-
ber plants to suppy a substitute for
the natural rubber not now availa-
ble. After the war we may foolishly
wish to continue synthetic rubber
production. Why should we use in-
ferior and expensive synthetics
when the natural product is again
available? No nation on earth is
self-suﬁicient and in order to make
the fullest use of our productive
capacity we must utilize raw ma-
terials from every corner of the
universe. The raising of trade bar-
riers will force us and the rest of
the world to use “ersatz” materials.

“To sum up: The problem is to
transform a highly productive war
economy into a highly productive
peace economy. Great personal gain
(attained by only one in a thousand,
anyway) must give way to the wel-
fare of the group. Manufacture for
universal use will decrease unem-
ployment. Incidentally, an increased
amount of government supervision
will be necessary to put the pro-
gram into operation."

University’s Stamp and Bond Committee
Continues Drive Towards $20,000 Goal

As its contribution to the Second
War Loan drive being conducted
over the nation from April 12 to
May 5, the University of Pittsburgh
War Bond committee has set a goal
of 1,000 bonds.

The original stamp and bond
drive was initiated in January of
1942, when Chairman Herbert
Gall, M43, formed a committee to
bring stamp and bond plirchasing
facilities closer to the large part

L of the student body.

In the Spring of last year, at a
time when General MacArthur was
having his troubles in the south-
east Paciﬁc, the committee devoted
one entire sales day as a tribute to
his heroic stand. Sales on Mac-
Arthur Day soared above $3200, a
record which has been approached
on a few occasions,

At the end of the Spring semes-

‘ter, Gall took a commission in
the Army Air Corps, and today
:is a ﬁrst lieutenant in Texas.

After Gall had gone, the commit-

tee made no plans for the summer

trimester, and it was again a

matter of individual enterprise to

sell stamps and bonds.

Into this breach stepped the mem-
bers of Druids, national_ activities
honorary fraternity for men. -Due
to the increased enrollment, the
shortness of the semester, and the
time lost in getting the drive under
way, the summer effort yielded only
$600,, whereas the spring drive had
netted better than $15,600.

In the fall, several members of
the original committee took over
the drive and re organized the whole
unit. The slogan adopted was “A
jeep a week,” which signiﬁed that
the committee would sell at least
$500 in stamps and bonds each
week, since the price of a single
jeep is suoted at $500.

,Results for this fall drive, how-
ever, were far above expectations,
and by January, the totals for the
entire drive had reached beyond the

’ $30,000 mark. It was then the com-

A _ mittee celebrated its first anniver-

7sary’, and vowed to go on to higher
, goals.

Slogan of the present Pitt
drive, as of the national elfort, is
“They give their lives, you lend
your money.” On Wednesday.
speakers visited all classrooms
during the third hour, and urged
students to buy or pledge to buy

‘  war bonds. '

With one more week remaining,

lA.the- committee is keeping the ground
~ﬁoo-r booth in the Cathedral open

every day. from 9:30 until 3:30

. o'clock so that all students and fac-

- lulty members may purchase bonds.

Recently- a ne w engineering
honorary was born on campus. Tom
Higgins and Claude'Culp, represen-
tatives from Oklahoma University
installed the Zeta Chapter of Tau
Omega, national honorary aeronau-
tical engineering fraternity. The
Delta Chapter and Epsilon Chapter
were installed at Illinois Tech and
University of Minnesota on April
12 and April 13. Other leading col-
leges and universities in the county
are contemplating. on installing
chapters on their campus.

Eleven charter members, seniors
in the aeronautical engineering de-
partment, were bestowed with the
honor of being the ﬁrst Tau Omegas:
Robert W. Stoner, president; Jo-
seph Salvucci, vice-president; Jo-
seph E. Zupanick, treasurer; George
F. Evans, secretary-historian; Ron-
ald G. Huff, corresponding secre-
tary; Alfred S. Valerino, William B.
Barkley, Walter A. Beachy, Walter
V. Kosiak, Homer J. Panizza, and
John Kleissas. Prof. J. E. Arnold
was elected senior faculty advisor,
Prof. T. G. Beckwith and Campbell
Yates were elected associate ad-
visors.

Guest speaker of the evening
was Mr. Ralph Upson, chief en-
gineer of the Heinz Aeronautical
Division. His subject was “Start-
ing a Job With Simplicity.” Prof.
T. G. Beckwith related a true ex-
perience that happened in his
home state, Kansas. His father,
G. D. Beckwith was a mechanic
for the barnstorrning Glenn L.
Martin. Prof. J. A. Dent told of
his experiences as a captain in the
last war. He was associated with
the Air Service Armament Divi-
sion. Prof, F. H. Stiening spoke
on “Finishing the Job,” and Dean
E. A. Holbrook encouraged the
group with a few interesting re-
marks.

Tonight’s the night, boys! Every-
one will get a glimpse of Joe Sal-
vucci’s Dorothy, Joe Zupanick’s

Released for the first time last year was Pitt’s Nine-Point War Program. In. the :fol-
lowing months since this program was released Pitt has accomplished its aims to an extent
that few other institutions can claim. Following is the complete report that Vice-Chancellor
Rufus H. Fitzgerald has drawn up. It is herewith given to Pitt’s menin the service through-

out the world to show them what the University is doing on the home front.

The University of Pittsburgh has, for some time, been
working on a plan for the most effective use of its personnel
and facilities in the war effort. The war program of the Uni-
versity was carefully prepared by the deans and committees
of the Senate. Here is a report of progress.

THREE AND ONE-HALF YEAR HIGH SCHOOL S’l.‘llDEN'I.‘S

The Universityand the high schools are co-operating to

give able young men and women  much education as possible

by the time they are eighteen years of age. The University has

' admitted to college selected students who have completed three

and a half years of high school..Their admission conforms to
the December 23, 1942 ruling of the Pennsylvania Depart-
ment of Education which provides that outstanding high
-school seniors may be admitted to college on the approval. of
responsible school authorities. One hundred and ﬁfty students
who have completed all but a semester of high school are now

.. enrolled in the University as freshmen and will be trained

under the accelerated program already set: up to graduate
"students in less than three years‘.
CRITICAL FIELDS
, The educational training of men and women. in the “criti-
cal ﬁelds” where there are shortages is going forward at full
speed. The divisions of the University concerned with. this
training are Medicine, Dentistry, Engineering, Nursing. Phar-
macy, the sciences, and mathematics.
- INDUSTRY
The University ishelping in every possible way to im-

3

A prove the skills of men and women in industry by training

them at college, professional, or graduate level. For more than

*a year, a number of our technical courses have made use of

a shifting schedule for men and women who are employed in
our steel mills and other industries and whose working hours
are subject to rotation or change of mill shifts. .We have du-
plicated instruction, giving the same work both by day and
by night so that the war worker can come to school and carry
0 nhiswar work. .
’.[‘RA1N]NG FOR WOMEN

The University is giving college courses for young women
needed to relieve shortages in many ﬁelds. Four kinds of train-
ing are provided, training for industry, training for -social
service, training for government positions, and training for
teaching in our schools.

GOVERNMENT RESEARCH

The University is doing an increasing amount of research
for the government. This cannot be talked about. We will con-
tinue these emergency research assignments. A committeeof
professors and of others keeps the government informed of

-the University's equipment and personnel.

NAVY TRAINING PROGRAM

Since the University has been chosen for Army training,
it is not likely to serve in the Navy training program. The
“V” programs at the University will continue until. the men
are assigned elsewhere. -

ARMY TRAINING PROGRAM ‘

Two groups or Army Air Crew students have been in
training at the University for several months. The detach-
ment is headed by Major E. R. Bartholomew, who arrived
February 18, 1943. The following official release describes the
training of the Air Crew students: _

.“The training schedule, which will be conducted with-
out interruption to‘ the regular -college curricu-lum. at Pitt,
will fall into four major groupings——academic, military,
physical and ﬂying. Purpose of the program will be to better
prepare men for cadet training in the AA~F Training Com.-
mand and. thereby vastly reduce costly eliminations.”

“Students will. be enrolled as privates and remain such
until the completion of the course, at which time they will.
be sent to one of the Flying Command’s Classiﬁcation Cen- I
ters as cadets and assigned. to training as pilots, bombardiers
or navigators.”

' “During the ﬁve months’ course students will receive
over 700 hours of academic and military instruction. Regular
University (or college) personnel will conduct the academic
and physical phase of the traininoz Academic subjects in-

‘ clude mathematics, physics, current. history, geography,
English and civil air regulations. Physical. training will be
stressed here in order to fit trainees to absorb future in-
tensive training without undue fatigue or ill effects.”

The University has been inspected for and is awaiting
approval for:

Basic Training in the Army Specialized Training Pro-
gram, Advanced Engineering Training. Area and Language
Training.

The University has been approved for inspection for:

Pre-"Medical Training, Medical Training, Pre-Dental
Training. Dental Training. Training in Personnel Psychol-
o r.

g) USUAL FUN(‘.'.l.‘l()NS

The University continues its usual functions. There will
be young men, who cannot pass the physical examinations, and
there will be young women who are not in the services. These
two groups will be important in keeping alive our culture‘
ideals.

ENGINEERING, SCIENCE, MANAGEMENT WAR TRAINING

The University will continue its Engineering, Science,
Management War Training program. The University was
among the first to offer its facilities to the government to
prepare men and women for war industries. We have just
completed the training of 3,313. In the two years the program
has been in operation we*have traineld 15,022 men and women.

As a University which has trained engineers, doctors,
lawyers, dentists, teachers, chemists and other scientists, bus-
iness men, and good citizens, we have a deﬁnite contribution

 . tomake, ‘for nowfand for thefuture. We can (teach lq~uiek_ly~»

were well expressed by a Fighting
Panther in a recent letter—“None
of us asked for this mess but
we’ve got it now. I haven't met a
soldier who doesn’t want to see it
through in a right and thorough
way.” We hope you have some
great adventures—and keep Pitt
in your heart.—T. W. BIDDLE.

Libraries Show \
Effects of War

War has made changes in the
libraries as well as in other parts
of the University. Changes have
been brought about not only in the
use of the rooms but also in the
staff. The Reference Room has
been given over, in part, to a War
Information Center which makes
available to Pitt ‘students last
minute information on the war and
its various "aspects. The Reserve
Room is at the disposal of the air-

crew cadets from 7 to 11 o’clock
every night, and books are placed
on reserve for them there.

Two students, Curtis Peters and
Dudley Gordon who worked as
pages in the reference room. and
in the stacks, are with the air
corps in Miami. Girls have re-
placed the boys in the libraries.

Dean Sends News Letters
0 Pitt’: Men In Services

Mr. Theodore Biddle, Dean of
Men, in co-operation with the Serv-
ice Records office, is keeping in touch
with many former Pitt men by
sending a periodic News Letter
about the University to those whose;
mailing addresses are available.
The many replies which have been
received testify to the eagerness
with which mail from home is re-
ceived. Many report that the News
Letters have been forwarded four or
five times before ﬁnally reaching
them since transfers are made fre-
quently. The replies bring news of
promotion, new locations, and other
Pitt men whom they have met in
service, as well as interesting items
about training. «

Four thousand, one hundred and
nine Pitt men and women are in-
cluded in the University Service
Records. The number is increasing
every day. Many of them were
alumni when they entered the serv-
ice; many others have left as under-
graduates. Of this number, 65 are
women. They are serving in the
Army and Navy Nurse Corps, in the
WAVES, the WAACS, the SPARS,
and the Marine Corps, Women’s
Reserve. Not included in this num-
ber are many who are doing recre-
ational‘ work with the Red -Cross.

Six men have died in combat; 23
others have died as a result of acci-
dents orillness; and six have been
reported missing. .

Pitt is represented all over the
world in the various branches of the
service and in ranks of the services,
fromprivateto colonel and seaman
to\ commander. Inlthe army, there

‘are ten colonels and 50 lieutenant

colon.e1s. In the Navy, there are two
commanders and 23 lieutenant-
commanders.

The Service Records oﬂice, located
in 3617 Cathedral of Learning, in
charge of Miss Alena Homer, is at-
tempting to assemble the names,
mailing addresses, and other infor-
mation concerning Pitt men and
women, both former students and

faculty members’, now in the service. ‘

Two hundred twenty-nine fac-
ulty and .oﬂ‘ice staff members of the
University are now in armed serv-
ice. Fifty-three of them are with
the General Hospital No. 27, at
Fort Lewis, Washington. Those who
have gone recently are Lt. Carroll
Amundson, U. S. N. R. and Lt. Rus-
sell J. Ferguson, U. S. N. R., of the
history department; Lt. (jg) Harry
Karns, U. S. N. R., of the psychol-
ogy department; and Private H. H.
Green, of the commercial depart-
ment.

iiwar Brings Many Changes

.To University

Pitt’s Engineering and Mines
' School has seen many changes in
the last year-and-a-half. About
A half of the faculty members have
gone into the armed services or
into war industries, the student en-
rollment has decreased. from 1,000
\to about 600, State Hall is no longer
V the Engineer’s private domain. and
» Dean Holbrook’s office has become
a center for deferment-seeking En-
, gineers an d bl.ue-print-seeki.ng
 draftees. .
 One of the greatest. outward‘
, changes is the large number of Col-
 lege students and Bus Ads now
climbing the hill to State and
Alumni halls, formerly Engineer-
ing territory only. Many Engineer-
ing classes have been moved to the
~Cathedral and over to Shadyside
building.

Until last January, Engineering
and Mines enrollment was at about
normal level. Since then, however,
the calling out of reserves and vol-
untary enlistments have brought a

I reduction of 40 per cent. In June,
, the ﬁrst group of 900 ASTC men
V ‘will arrive at Pitt to spend about

18 months in Engineering School.

7 Among Engineering and Mines
 alumni in the Service are four of
 ' the leading air ﬁghters in the South

Paciﬁc war area, Lt. Col. Wagner,
, » who lost his li'fe last fall; Lt. Col.
+_ vTeats; Captain Lynch; and Lt. Vi-
 tunac. The ﬁrst two were aero. en-

gineers. ‘Hundreds of other E&M

F. W..SHOCKLEY
director of Evening School

Evening School
Continues Strong

Through War

From the oﬁice of Dr. Frank W.
Shockley
news:

The majority of men regularly
enrolled in evening classes are in
the lower age levels of the selec-
tive service_ regulations. As a re-
sult, these men have been drop-
ping out of school in large num-
bers to enter the Armed Forces
since the beginning of the second
semester of 1941-42. Many men up-
on completion of high school, who

A in normaltimes would have ob-

tained employment and entered
evening classes to start work to-
word degrees, have entered the
Service instead.

Although these and other condi-
tions have reduced enrollments, the
need for specialized training in
many ﬁelds has resulted in in-
creases which have partially offset
the loss of men to the Armed
Forces. Enrollments actually have
increased in some subjects such as
mathematics, including air and sea
navigation; meteorology; a n d
nursing education. Many short in-
tensive courses have been added.

Mr. Karl Punzak of the Eve-
ning Office staff is now a Second
Lieutenant in the Air Corps and
Mr. C. Stanton Belfour is a Lieu-
tenant (jg) in the U. S. Naval
Reserve. Many members of the
faculty who regularly taught eve-
ning classes are in the Service.
The last to receive Commissions in
the U. S. Naval Reserve are Dr.
Carroll Amundson, Lieutenant,
and Dr. Russell Ferguson, Lieuten-
ant, both of the History Depart-
ment. .

Other faculty members in the
Service who regularly taught eve-
ning classes are: Robert L. Ar-
thur, Lieutenant, U. S. Naval Re-
serve; Harold A. Phelps Lieuten-
ant, U. S. Naval Reserve; William
Arthur, Captain, Army Air Corps.

The Evening Students Associa-
tion has continued its program
with some curtailments. Mr. Char-
les Cotton is the president during

 ".““ ‘°°“°‘”“g Pitt Students in Activities.

Aid Work of War Center

Accomplishments of the War In-
‘formation center of the University
have been tremendous in compari-
son with the usual work of the par-
ticipating activities. The center, one
of two hundred in the nation, is co-
operating with the United States
Oﬁice of Education in assembling
material relating to the war effort
and placing that information at the
disposal of all neighboring organi-
zations.

Program of the speech groups
was to organize a symposium on.
important topics suggested by the
war. The symposium, which con-
sists of four speakers each of
whom selects one phase of the
subject, then appears before a
local organization. The boys of
the Men’s Debating association
appeared before twenty-one wom-
en’s clubs, high school groups,
churches, Rotary" clubs, and civic
clubs. Their most unusual appear-
ance was at a penitentiary. Most
common subject was “What Are
We Fighting For?” There were
several other subjects, the most
representative of which are: “The
Good Neighbor Policy,” “Our
Enemies,” “Our Allies,” and “The
Post-War World.”

Women’s Speech association also
devoted much of its time to prepar-
ing symposia. The girls spoke 30
times on such subjects as “What

Are We Fighting For?,” “The Four
Fr_eedoms,” “Our Enemies,” “Post-
War Organization,” “Civil Liber-
ties,”. and “The Role of College
Women in War Times.” Their audi-
ences were also fraternal organiza-
tions, women’s clubs, and high
school groups. Miss Haun, director
of Women’s Speech, supervised the
symposia speeches.

Pitt Players under the direc-
tion of Buell Whitehill, Instructor
in speech, produced ﬁve plays,
made twenty performances, and
appeared before the largest. total
audience in their history, ﬁve
hundred persons. “Abe Lincoln in
Illinois,” in addition to two cam-
pus performances, appeared at
four local recreation centers and
several. factories. “Till the Day
I Die,” a bitter anti-Nazi play,
was performed before six of-
campus organizations. “Knicker-
bocker Holiday” with all its mu-
sical trimmings was given forthe
air cadets stationed at Pitt.

The library ingits War Informa-
tion Center on the ﬁfth. floor, Cathe--
dral, has displayed‘ hundreds of
pamphlets, periodicals, and books
on many diversiﬁed subjects includ-
ing Latin American nations, the
latest weapons and stratagies of
war, our enemi es, the four freedoms,
the home front‘, and our Allies.

Bus. Ad. Graduates To Plan
World ‘'5 Post Warfconomy

Men trained in economics will play" an important part in
the post—war world, according to Dr. Vincent W. Lanfear, dean
of the School of Business Administration. Since all post war
planning is ‘based on. economics, men will be needed to help
solve such problems as international economic relations, gov-
ernment—owned war plants, labor relations, and the question of
how to handle the service charge on the huge war debt.

Someday the Panthers are going to play a home game
when the temperature is above thirty. Someday the Panthers
zareegoing to play a game in which they make fewer than four
errors. And someday the Panthers are even going to win a

,. ,At.present the Pitts have completed one-half of their
schedule and they have yet to record a win. ‘They lost their

first game to Navy 7-0, a loss that
ilmight be excused on the basis that

‘Navy has an exceptionally strong

-team this year and is as yet un-
defeated. Then they lost to Juniata
ylaist Saturday and that loss cannot
be, excused. The Panthers, just
in case you haven’t heard, were
leading 8-Ofgoing into the las
‘half of the eighth inning. '

w. 'Reber had allowed but three
f'scratch~ hits and only one ball had
1 been hit out of the inﬁeld. But
just the same, at the end of the
tenth inning, the score read 9-8 and
1 Pitt was not on the long end.

The Panthers opened their home
season Wednesday against Buck-r
hell. The weather wasifreezing and
the baseball team was only luke
_-warm with the ﬁnal score show-
ing B-ucknell ahead 7-6. The Pan-
«thers kept up with their tradition
of hospitality by contributing four
‘errors, two passed balls, a wild
pitch, and a tipped. bat to the
Bucknell cause.
Jim“ Reber who pitched the last
‘ﬁve innings of the Navy game, al-

.3‘ Rlovviing only one run and two hits.
” ’and who did a fine job up to the

eighth inning of the Juniata con-
test, tried once again for a win
‘against Bucknell. But the Bisons
tiook. an early lead in their half

I of’, the second ‘inning and were

n;e‘m- headed.

Llifred Drexel opened the inning
with a single toleft. Stamm forced
him at second and then went to

cond on Burn’s single to center.
A-7P3SSed ball moved Burns to sec-
})nd and Stamm to third. Iarocci
gtlren sent one to the middle ﬁeld
which scored Stamm and Burns.
He went to second on the futile

a throw to the plate and scored on
Jack Warde-n’s single to right.

{The Panthers threatened brieﬂy

.11 their half of the inning but the
best they could get out of it was a

cond. Carlaccini and McKee
lifted to Drexler in left. But Hal-
ter-ebooted Kuntz’s short fly for two

f?Bucknell added another run in

he fourth on a base on balls, a

Pitt managed to make a game of

McKee’s double to right center.
Carlaccini scored a few ‘minutes
later when Red Patterson sent a
towering double to right.

Bucknell quickly erased the Pan-
ther advantage in the seventh.
Halter twalked. Drexler attempted
to bunt and was safe at first, Hal-
ter stopping at second, when Kielb
threw wild past Patterson. Pitcher
Stamm then slammed a single to
right that scored both Halter and
Drexler. ‘

What proved to be the winning
run was a present. With Stamm on
first, Burns sent a ‘double play ball
to Carlaccini. who tossed to "Fisher
for the nforce-out on ,Stamm, but
Fisher threw wild past Patterson
on the attempt for the double play
and the error was "good for three
bases. Bill McKee, who relieved
Reber in thesixth, then uncorked a
wild pitch that permitted Stamm
to score.

That was how things stood until
the ninth when the Panthers gave
the handful of fans who braved
the icy temperatures to watch the
game a brief thrill when they
scored two runs with two men
out. But it was one run short.

The 'Mitterlingmen outhit the
Bisons _10—8 but they still pay off
in runs so the game merely result-
ed in another loss; '

Pitt will be idle until Wednes-
day when they meet Juniata in a
return meet at the Stadium. It had
been hoped that a game could be
carded for this Saturday, but the
plans fell through.

The 1943 football schedule must have been made out to
the tune of “There’s gonna be some changes made.” The third
change in the schedule wasannounced this week when it was
made known» that the Duke game“ scheduled for October 2 at
Durham had been cancelled due to transportation difﬁculties.

Earlier, the SMU contest which was to be played October
23 was cancelled for the same reason and a game with Notre
Dame to be played here September 26 was substituted. _

It is expected that the date left
open by cancellation of the Duke
contest will be ﬁlled by West_Vir-
ginia, thus” renewing a series
dropped in 1939.

Transportation continues to loom
as a bigger and bigger problem‘.
Although the Duke and SMU games
have already been dropped, the

Panthers are still scheduled to

play Illinois and Nebraska away
from home. And there is much
doubt concerning the Minnesota
game which is to be played here
October 9.

If Pitt succeeds in scheduling the
‘West Virginia game for the Sta-
dium, they will boast exception-
ally fine home schedule with all but
two games played at the Stadium.
In addition to Notre ‘Dame, Pitt is
scheduled to play Minnesota, Ohio
State, Penn State, 4 and ‘Carnegie
Tech here. \

If the Panthers and Mountain-
eers do renew football relations
they will be carrying. on one of the
oldest major rivalries in the district.
Dating back to 1895, the meetings

between the two teams have rarely
failed to produce a hang up ball
game despite the fact that Pitt was
usually the winner. The Panthers
have won 26, lost nine and tied two,
and outscored the Mountaineers,
686 to 174.

At the time the football relations

were severed in 1939 Pitt had won

11 consecutive. games. The reason
for the ‘break was Pitt’s desire to
strengthen the Big Ten ties and so
the 1 Mountaineers were dropped
from the schedule to make room for
one of the Western Conference
teams. 1

The series with the ﬂuke Devils
was an especially colorful one, since
on several occasions it produced
Rose Bowl invitations and mythical
national honors" for the winning
team. In 1937 Pittwound up their
season with a 10-0 win over the
Blue Devils, thus preserving their
unbeaten record and giving them
the mythical national title. In 1938
Duke reversed things by defeating
Pitt’s “Dream Backﬁeld,” 7-0 and
thus they completed their unbeaten-
untied-unscored-on s e a s o n and
went on to the ‘Rose Bowl.

Duke captured the last three
gamés and so at present the record
stands at four victories for the Blue
Devils to three for Pitt.

Hartwig Takes
Over IM Program

For the ﬁrst time this spring,
a full intramural schedule was
played this week. Tennis, softball,
and horseshoes were the sports
participated in by the Greeks.

In Monday’s softball contests the
Pi Lams whitewashed the Lambda
Chi’s, 1-0 and Phi Epsilon Pi
nosed out Sigma Chi 4-3. The New-
man Club won out over the A.C.’s
1-0 and the Delts completely
swamped the APD’s 13-2.

The PiKa’s and the Phi Delts
participated in another 1-0 contest
which was taken by the former.
In the ﬁnal contest played Mon-

day, the SAE’s were soundly de-
feated by the Phi Gams. 11 to 5.

Weather conditions forced the
softball to. be shifted‘ to a double
elimination basis. The playoff
games were held Tuesday and
Wednesday.

The fraternity tennis season was
opened Wednesday when the
School of Pharmacy boys met the
Phi Delts and the Sammies played
against Delta Tau Delta. The

SAE’s and Phi Gams met Lambda'

Chi and Pi Lambda Phi respective-

ly yesterday and the Sigma Chi’s A

meet the PiKa’s today to wind up
the weeks tennis matches.

The intramural program is now
being directed by Charles “Doc”
Hartwig assistant football coach
and physical instructor, replacing
Frank Carver who left this week
for the army.

Golf Team Meets
W. Va.Here Today

The University golf team will
try again today when they meet
West Virginia here. The Golfers
did not do too well in their initial
start against Navy last Saturday.
The ﬁnal score was Navy 9, Pitt
0. The principal diﬂiculty lay in
the fact that none of the Navy
golfers shot above seventy and
none of the Pitt golfers shot be-
low eighty. An idea of the
strength of the Navy team may
be gathered from the fact that a
boy who shot a regular 73 was
not good enough to make the Navy
second team.

The individual Pitt scores were
as follows: Bill Holstein, 87; Jim
Dunn, 85; Jim Butcher, 83; Russ
Smith, 86; Norbert Kroen, 83; and
Dave Thurbon, 82.

The tennis team, coached by
"Doc” Hartwig will swing into ac-
tion tomorrow against Army at
West Point. Saturday they will
meet Penn State at State College.

One of the major events of the
W.A.A. Physical Fitness Program,
the Interorganizational Bowling
Tournament, can be termed a suc-
cess. Not only did Pitt women en-
joy this sport as a “must” on
their recreation list, but they have
come to realize the value of bowl-
ing as a means of exercise and
keeping in condition.

\Below is a chart revealing a
complete resume of the entire tour-
nament which lasted for ﬁve
weeks, each team having been
scheduled to bowl once a week.

Each team was awarded three
points (Column III) for every
week they participated plus two
more points (Column IV) if they
won their match in competition,
and one point if they won by de-
fault. Column I shows the aver-
age of each team’s scores.

Then each team was ranked by

0 It looks just like it always did-—-that Grey-
hound you see loading up at the terminal in
your town—but it’s bound on a “military
mission”, just as surely as if it were rolling in
a convoy down a mountain road in Tunisia.

Tools of war have to be built before battles
are won—and workers have to be transported
to the war plants that are supplying our
growing armies. That’s ‘a big part of Grey-
hound’s wartime duties — getting workers to
work, often many miles from their homes.

  

cs we  V are in aa-

Then, there are soldiers to carry to and from
training camps or other military centers-—on
duty and on leave. And there are many others
whose travel is essential to full wareffort.

If on some occasion Greyhound service isn’t
quite as convenient or comfortable as in the
past, please remember that the war eﬂott
comes ﬁx-st—that the job of whipping the Axis
has to be done at home as well as abroad. With

ant coach. /

He was deeply interested in

- American political history, and his

book “Early Politics in Western
Pennsylvania” was published in
1937. As a ‘member of the Western
Pennsylvania Historical society,
he brought some of the richest
