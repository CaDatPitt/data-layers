Trouble for First Bus  
Starting in Birmingham

By JACKI KATZ

Trouble for the first bus of demonstrators that went
to_ Alabama began when they stopped at a gas station in
Birmingham to use the rest facilities, before reaching Mont-

gomery.

According to Howard Shuck, the only student from

Students Approve and Scorn but
Bus — Trek Protest to South 

1 Students who didn’t go to Montgomery, A1a., seem to have some opinion about‘ ..
those who did. In fact, in a poll conducted by The Pitt News, the gamut of opinion ran
from those who condemned the student protest to those who hailed it as “grea ”

Some students asked that their names be ithh ld, b t all 1' d t th t' :
“What do you think of the University students’ liiip t(e> MoI1lltgom1eEi}y,l(.aAlaf)?” e ques Ion

Fern Pitt, LA senior: “I approve of the sentiment "behind it. Projects like the .
Hill Education Project are too long-range for some students, so rather than sit back and —

Carnegie Institute of Technology to go, a white convertible
pulled up behind the bus with five or six white men. “One of the

men went to the telephone,” Shuck said. “While we were using the
rest facilities, three police cars and one paddy-wagon converged on
the station.

“I heard there were police dogs there, but I never saw any. so
I don’t really know if there were any.” Shuck explained that the
police used the pretense that the students had jaywalked while un-
loading the bus in order to question them.

“Father Xavier Carroll of Mt. Mercy College acted as our spokes-
 he continued. He told the police that the bus contained students
and educators who were on an educational trip to the Florida state
capitol at Tallahassee.”

During the rest of the trip ,informal seminars on tactics were
conducted. It was stressed that no one must react to any jeering or

wait, they went South to help. I think that some students might not have gone if they
had been more aware of the danger to_ their personal safety. I don’t know 'how success-
111 they were, but I think it was a success; in the sense that it enlightened the students who went and

the Pitt campus. I wasn’t aware of how bad the situation really is until I heard Rabbi Rubenstein com.

pare it to Nazi Germany.”

James Dwkeyt Engineering Sophomore: “The trip had a purpose, but I wouldn't have gone. some
said what a great time they had and said they had a lot of fun, when they got off the bus. But I don’t
feel they were right. A lot went to be noticed and had no purpose. They were just thinking of material
values (break from school, etc.).” Dockey said he didn’t like the image presented by those who toted
guitars. He believes that supporting civil rights by letters and donations is okay but frowned on the
trek. He said: “I.canv’t imagine the cops would cause any trouble. I think Eric Stern and the others
were doing something they shouldn't have been. There were 5000 others who were marching and
weren’t hurt. I don’t think Stem’s any martyr. Iweren’t hurt. I don’t think Stern's any martyr. In

comments, ‘but that they must be
completely passive to everything
around them. .

All the students were told to
memorize the phone number 263-
4481 which was the number of
the Ben More Hotel, the Students

mittee (SNCC) headquarters.
“Many of the students Wrote the
phone number on their bodies,”

Shuck said.

‘.‘We were also reminded that
civil liberties as such do not exist
in Alabama and if we were ar-
rested we might not be allowed
to make a phone call,” Shuck
mention. “But we were told to
have a dime with us just in
case.”

When the bus reached the Ben
More ‘Hotel at about 7 p.m. Mon-
day, police were holding back
crowds of 500 to 1,000 who were
waiting to march to the capitol.
“We couldn’t unload the bus, so
we went up a side street. Eric
Stern, John Ruskay, and Linda
Watts got out and went to a con-
ference with SNCC officials.

Arrested

Three University students
were arrested in a civil
rights demonstration in
Montgomery, Alabama last
Thursday night. Those ar-
rested were: Roland Ro-
berge, LA sophomore; Shar-
on Walls, LA freshman; and Stan
Goldberg, LA junior.

The students were participat-
ing in a civil rights picket in

‘ front of the state capitol build-

ing in Montgomery. The pickets
were hemmed in by a group of
white citizens on one side and a
barricade on the other side.

The civil rights group and the
white group then converged at
which time the police asked the
groups to break up. As the crowd
began to disperse the civil rights
pickets sat down in the street.
The police then arrested those.

Pittsburgh area lived up to their reputation Thursday night
at the PM Series. They were the Antiqua Players under the
direction of Colin Sterne. Included on the program were the
Pittsburgh Madrigal Singers who also did an admirable job.

An outstanding feature of the music was its historical
interest. The music, dating from the Middle Ages, is not

nearly as sophisticated as our
more modern concepts but, in its
simplicity, illustrates the evolu-
tion of musical ‘styles as well as

‘ inﬂuential trends of thought.

Thus the “Gloria” by Guillaume
Dufay was ﬁlled with imitative
counterpoint that was to inﬂu-
ence most later musicians, not-
ably Bach, while “Files a mariez,”
by Gilles Binchois, was a song in
which the lyrics abounded with
traditional concepts of courtly
love.

Madrigal Singers performed, with _

well as the aforementioned “Glo-
ria," making their part of the
concert ‘a real success.

to be going along for the ride.

--Wham! It seems all on the sur-

Allarta Katz, LA freshman: “I

fgivefthose who went down with
_'-ithevnright intentions a lot of cred-
-‘it. The only way people are go-

’ LA. senior coed: “Nine-tenths
of the students probably didn’t
know what they went down for.
They were just getting on the
bandwagon. It was a fun-type

. thing for them.”

IVOR. THOMAS, LA senior: “If
they have noble intentions, I'm
all for it. But if they just went

to attract attention, then I dis-

approve of it. I really think,

-though, that they have compas-

sion and feel sorry for the mal-

Chris Sanders, LA freshman:

- “It was not necessary for them
‘ to go. There is a law and it is

the President’s duty to enforce it
without having to make martyrs
out of Unitarian clergymen and
college students.”

Sherry Thompson, LA fresh-

man: “I don’t think‘ that a lot of
them were really serious and
dedicated to the cause. It was a
joyride, .a Fort Lauderdale for
most of them. I don’t think that
they accomplished too much of
anything. The three students who
got themselves in jail were prob-
ably trying to make martyrs out
of themselves.”

Dennis Kozar, Engineering
sophomore: “Silly. I don’t feel it’s
a plan to accomplish anything.
They just got in the road. I don’t
think it’s any of their (students’)
business. It brought publicity to
Pitt that I don’t think is good.
Stern is a bad representative. He
drives people (prospective enrol-
lees) away from Pitt.”

Janet Gutman, LA senior: “I
think that they have done a lot
to merit admiration. It did not
seem well-organized and perhaps
it was not the wisest thing todo,
but the students who went bene-
ﬁted and the students who stayed
in Pittsburgh benefited by being
so close to the situation. The
main beneﬁt was the fact that it
showed Southern Negroes that
we do feel for them.

LA sophomore: “I don’t agree‘

with it yet I. can't condemn them
for going. I don’t think it -was a
rational way_ of going about it,
but actually I don’t feel very
strongly either way.”

Glenis Drury, Education sen-
ior: “The more people down there
supporting the cause, the better.
The students who went down ac-
complished a lot for themselves
in that they probably know the
situation better. The ones who
went. down just for laughs, not
understanding the danger, should
not‘ have gone."

Education senior: “No opinion,

-really. Some had their own opin-

ions and some went for a ride.
But it’s ﬁne for the ones that
went if they wanted to do it. If
they wanted to (protest) it’s
ﬁne.”

Betsy Green, LA sophomore:
“It was an unfortunate thing. It
was not a good idea going down
there. It stirred up a lot of trou-

lpp1’OV€ an I  

ble. Some of the kids were dedi-
cated to the cause, but a lot were
not thinking rationally. They just
got very worked-up" over this
whole business. However, I think
that perhaps the bill for voting
rights is going through faster be-
cause of it. I admire the kids
deeply who were willing to risk
their lives to go down there.”

Allan L. Fingeret, LA sopho-
more: “I have mixed feelings. I
feel that the Negroes in the South
should have voting rights and
freedom, but don’t see what busi-
ness these students have in Ala-
bama. Going was a good thing
and it showed a ﬁne feeling of
solidarity. But people in Ala-
bama are saying: ‘Look at those
carpetbaggers.” He thought the
marchers were lucky. “The vio-

lence was minor compared to

what it could have been.”
Liberal Arts freshman: “I- dis-
agree with what they did. I don’t
think that it proved anything.
They learned how things actual-
ly are down there, and their go-
ing may have contributed some-
‘thing toward human development
but not‘ toward civil rights.

Marching to Washington and lob- -

bying there would have been
more eﬁective.”

Robert .MoGinnis, Education
junior: “A large percentage of
sincere indiivduals who had a
good purpose went. A small num-
ber didn’t care and just went
where the action was. It shows
an interest at Pitt and that’s the
way- it should be received.’.’

LA junior: “I have mixed re-

actions. I wonder if they should’

have done it, yet I wonder if I
should have gone. I'm. rather re-

' lievedlthat I didn’t have to make.

the decision. I didn’t laugh at
them from the beginning the way

that mostof the kids did.”

LA senior: “I’m not sure how
I feel. It seemed like a sobering
experience for those who went.
National attention has to be

brought to the situation, but I’m.

not sure that this was a good way
to do it. I wish there was a better
way to do it.”

Susan Howard, LA junior: “I
don’t think that it was a good
thing. They were not wanted and
had no business being there. They
probably just added to the chaos.
If more people like Rabbi Ru-
benstein or other faculty mem-
bers who would carry weight had
gone, it might have been differ-
ent. I think that most of the stu-
dents went because it sounded
exciting. It was a Fort Lauder-
dale-type thing—-a new fad.”

Michael Foglia, LA freshman:
“Great. I think it’s great every-
body’s ﬁghting for the Negro’s
rights. I don’t think they went
for a joyride. I think it’s good for
Pitt. Every college should take
part to show the students have
an interest in national affairs.”

LA ilmior: “I don’t know ex-
actly what the purpose was. I’m
not sure it was a good idea to
go, although I realize it was spon-
taneous and not planned. I ques-
tion the wiseness of the move.
Passive resistance must be cau-
tiously used.” He felt that people
may be crying wolf too often. “If
they occur to frequently, they
will lose meaning when a criti-
cal demonstration springs up.”

Tech Student Recounts Happening

“While they were in the con-
ference, the police let the march-
ers go and the crowd disbursed
orderly,” Shuck continued. A
SNCC official then got on the bus
and told them what was to hap-
pen that night. “The marchers
who had just disbursed were
marching to the capitol and in-
tended to sleep in, expecting to
be arrested. We were asked if
we wanted to join them and de-

After sitting for an hour and

and joined a. rally there. There
were about 300 people in a.
church built for 100, according
to Shuck. “We got food there and
we slept in the church. The other
two buses arrived in the middle
of the night and stayed at an-
other church.

Following breakfast at a cafe
down the block from the church,
the ﬁrst bus group met with the
rest of the delegates from Pitts-
burgh and had a rally at the
Jackson Street Church. “Then we
marched to the Negro community
through high schools, picking up
students, and then to the Ala-
bama State College Campus. The
size of our group kept increas-

Direction

  

Student participation without conscientious direction is almost worthless. It does
little good for students to be involved and to expend their energies in futile directions.

 * Many times, this misspent energy is a source of more problems and trouble than the
good it is trying to accomplish.

This campus is experiencing a surge of tremendous enthusiasm for student in-

 volvement. Because of what happened in Alabama, many students, never personally
 involved in anything before, feel compelled to do something.

Yet they are uncertain of what .to do or how to go about it. Many want to, but
cannot go to Alabama or Mississippi, and because of t-his feel useless to the Civil Rights

movements. They are wrong.

The Pitt Chapter of the NAACP has published a list of activities in the area of

it I Civil Rights. Only four out of the eleven suggestions call for the student to travel dis-

tances. Among the items listed is helping with voter registration here in Pittsburgh
through the United Negro Protest Committee. '

The Hill Education Project offers one of the most rewarding experiences open to
students. For the few hours that a student tutors, the personal satisfaction of helping
others more than compensates for the loss of time.

The NAACP chapter here is to ,be commended for recognizing that students, espe-
cially now, need capable direction. They have provided a good start with this single piece

' of «paper. Conscientious planning such as this will continue to make the civil rights effort

here one of the most important and dynamic forces on this campus.

 The Lesson from Alabama

Condemnation and Commitment

Some of the most profound lessons that
men can learn are inadvertant ones, con-
ceived in jest but striking with the force
of a bullet. Many of the students who went
to Alabama this weekend did so with doubts

 »   intheir minds at least,

 and many others went

only for the glory and

the fadism. On their

 return they were dif-
ferent people.

Alabama was bru-
;. tal. This was written
\' on the faces of every
person who got off the
buses on Wednesday
 evening. But before

we are too quick to
praise students like

Rights.

By Barry Shaw

A GREATER lesson may lie here. Those
students, as ignoble as their aims may have
been when they left the University, came
back with a common knowledge. A look of
shock did not escape any passenger on those
homecoming buses, and their diverse mo-
tives were reconciled in. their sentiments.
As we are apt to say today, the commitment
is the important thing and these students,
by commiting themselves only to going to
Alabama, all returned with a far greater
commitment —- -a commitment to

Civil

So, while we can condemn certain people
for their naive attitudes in going to Ala-
bama, we can never condemn them for the
act of going and, in all likelihood, we will
never be able to condemn their naivete
again. Their lesson, and their further serv-
ice, far outshadows any grievance we may
hold against them, and also makes us far
more angry at ourselves for not having
made a similar decision.

A State Status   Quality ‘

Will Standards Decline?

By Donald Friedman

Since the existence and extent of the University’s
budget deﬁcit were made known to the public a few months.
ago, there "has been much talk, both idle and serious, about
the possibility of becoming a state university.

_ Consideration of this proposal has advanced to a very
serious stage, as evidenced by thefact that two local legis-
lators, Representatives Max H. Homer of Stowe Township
and Thomas J. Foe_rster of the North Side, after conferring
with Chancellor Litchﬁeld, have introduced House resolu-
tions calling for an investigation of the
possibility of Pitt's becoming a state
institution.

ARGUMENTS BOTH for and against
the switch are many, but all center
around one very practical issue—money.
The University’s operating budget has
jumped from $15 million to $60 million
in the last ten years, an increase that
income has been unable to match. The
Chancellor has pointed out that the Uni-
 versity’s endowment has not been up to
FRIEDMAN expectation, or at least need, and that
to increase the endowment sufficiently or to ﬁnd other
sources of revenue will be very difficult. Therefore, pro-
ponents of the switch conclude, the University not only
should, but must, become a state institution. Opponents of
the switch, however, are quick to point out that even bona
ﬁde state colleges are not receiving enough money from the
state. »

THE FINANCIAL point can be arguedendlessly, but
the people who are arguing it are overlooking one very
important aspect, which ‘in the eyes of the student body may
be the most important. The students here are paying Ivy
League prices, -but nobody claims they are getting Ivy
League quality. The University, they are told, is moving
toward Ivy League status, a long, arduous climb. Although
the University has made great strides in the past nine years,
its Ivy League goals have not yet been reached. The expec-
tation has always been that this trend of improvement would
continue.

Until now students have paid for more quality than
they have received, because they knew that in the future,
when they said they had graduated from the University of
Pittsburgh, it would mean as much as graduating from an
Ivy League school. Without this qualification, it is foolish
to pay Ivy League prices. The possibility of the University
becoming a state institution adds a completely new area of
consideration to the situation. _

It is inconceivable for the state to accept the added
ﬁnancial burden of supporting the University without get-
ting some service in return. The obvious manner in which
the University can help the state is to take some of the
load. from the over-crowded state schools by accepting more
Pennsylvania students. This, however, might mean lower-
ing the University's standards, since most state colleges
rank on the academic scale. When questioned with regard
to this point, Representative Homer said that the purpose
of the switch would be to provide low-cost college education
to area students, while maintaining the University's “high
level of importance and academic signiﬁcance.”

AN EXTENSIVE scholarship program would not serve
the same purpose, since the University would still have con-
trol over admissions, and Representative Homer is inter-
ested in providing educational opportunities to a larger num-
ber of area students than is now served by the University.

The idea of being a state college is not intrinsically bad;
nobody laughs at the Universities of Michigan and Cali-
fornia. If the University does become a state institution,
however, it must not lose sight of its obligations to the
present students. Academic standards must not be lowered
or even frozen. They must continue to rise. Under that
condition, and that condition only, can the University honor-
ably become a state institution.

    

 

if the rest of our nation is not
shocked into reality. These were
not wild-eyed rioters, throwing
bottles and bricks. but an order-
ly group of determined citizens,
determined to see that constitu-
tional rights were upheld. The
large number of college students
in that group learned the true
cost of freedom, and they saw
price tag attached to the simple
undeniable right to orderly pro-
test of ‘social injustice.

 Over Matter

Man- Not ‘Mere’ Macine

3! PETE HORN

“Men are machines,” Professor May Brodbeck told her
Philosophy of Science audience Thursday night, “but they
are not mere machines.” The University of Minnesota pro-
fessor lectured on “Freedom and Knowledge: Man vs. Com-
puter.” Machines, she said, may act by rules, be se1f-cor-
recting and goal-pursuing, but they are not human. They
do not have minds, nor can they feel pain, happiness or

anxiety. They are not conscious.

“It is illuminating to distin-
guish men from robots, Dr. Brod-
beck said. We can see the mani-
fest ways in which robots change
with respect to their environ-
ments (‘behave’), similarly to hu-
mans, but we know that they do
not do so- consciously. Mere sim-
ulation of overt acts, in other
words, is not the same as duplica-
tion of inner biochemical pro-
cesses.

“Becausea robot has no brain,”
Dr. Brodbeck said, “we have no
good reason to say it has mind.”
We can know about other minds
because of the way in which
others speak of their mental
states, but to say that a robot
can be human is to argue from

a similarity in some respects to
a similarity in other respects, she
said.

Dr. Brodbeck argued ‘ that be-
cause robots would not have the
same bodily states as men, “they
will not be all that a man can
be.”

Without the human attribute of
consciousness, she continued
there is neither freedom nor mor-
ality. “Ony a conscious agent can
sin, feel, have a will, or have de-
sire that makes a difference in
decisions. There is no freedom,
without the feeling of freedom
and the opportunity for free-
dom.”

In order for a person to “choose

MAY BRODBE
freely.” Dr. Brodbeck said, he
must have a set of alternatives.
“A society is more or less ‘free,’
based on how much freedom its
people have, how many alterna-
tives they have. Increased know-
ledge brings about greater num-
bers "of alternatives, and there-
by a correspondingly greater feel-
ing. '

NEW PHYSICAL Education building recently con.
structed by the General State Authority may be

ready for the Spring trimester. Building is located
next to Trees Pool.

Physical Education Building
May Be Ready for Spring

By JAY ROSENSTEIN

The University's new
physical education facilities
may be available on a limit-

ed basis for the spring tri-
mester. The decision will
come from the vice-chancel-
1or’s office sometime this
week.

In about 30 days, the General
State Authority (GSA) gives the
building to the University. All
construction was ﬁnanced by the
GSA and the University must
staff and equip it.

The building will be open only
for instructional use if it is used
this spring. There will be little
if any recreational time and
space alloted.

When construction began, con-
tractors set a. target date of Sep-
tember, 1965. Due to good weath-
er, the work went ahead of sched-
ule. Physical Education and Ath-
letic Department people expect
the facilities to be available for
full use at least by the fall term.

The building contains three
regulation size boys’ basketball
courts for intramural use that
convert into either 12 badminton
courts or three volleyball courts.
There are also two regulation size
girls’ basketball courts that be-
come either eight badminton or
two volleyball courts. Other fa-
cilities include: ll handball
courts, a rifle range for ROTC
use, several dance studios, exer-
cise rooms, and classrooms.

The girls will have their own
standard 43 by 75 foot swim-
ming pool for physical education
classes. In addition, all girls’ gym

classes will be switched from the

“Because of the new gymnasi-
um, it will be possible to have
smaller classes, more meaning-
ful instruction, more varied ac-
tivities, and more practice time
for those taking physical educa-
tion,” said Dr. Carl Peterson.

Fitzgerald Field House remains
the site for intercollegiate sports,
and a newly-constructed tunnel
connects it with the new facil-
ities. The purpose of this rear-
rangement is to provide .a maxi-
mum amount of space and equip-
ment for instruction.

Rex Peery,

New Rule

Aid Ailing Golf Squad

By GEORGE LIES

A new coach and a new

rule will beneﬁt the golf team

when itopens its season at West Virginia, April 23.
Coach Rex Peery becomes the new golf coach,_when he

finishes his wrestling job this season. “Rex along with the
Chartiers Country Club’s professionals will work with the

team this Spring,” haid Wal
letic Director.

The new ruling by the Eastern
Collegiate Athletic Conference
allows athletes to participate in
spring sports without attending
school and will increase the num-
ber of golfers.

“Because of the new rule, the
part-time student will show more
interest and have a lee-way with
school studies,” said Cummins.
“And, of course, the team’s rec-
ord should improve, not only be-
cause more are returning from
last year's squad, but because
there will be more new candi-
dates.”

In a losing season last year,
the team had no real coach. “Last
year, Rex couldn’t handle the
team because he was involved
with the Olympic wrestling team.
Mr. Barton (Athletic Department
Assistant) usually traveled with
them,” said Cummins.

FOOTBALL TEAM

Spring football practice he-
gan last Friday at 4 p.m. on
the stadium ﬁeld. All collegiate
teams have a 30 day period in
which to get 20 days of prac-
tice before their late summer
camp. Summer camp usually
bﬁgins in August at Meadville,
Pa.

Although the team has been
granted the use of the Chartiers
course, it can only practice Mon-
day and Thursday afternoons and
Friday. “The team practices only
at certain times because the club
has committments to its own
members,” Cummins said.

Peery feels the team would im-
prove greatly if the golfers prac-
tices included more physical con-
ditioning.

Time has proved

its worth.

chance to make aproper
career decision before
graduation.‘ 37°/o of
those participating in
this program in the last
10 years are currently
enjoying successful
careers with the
Company in sales,

others. We'd be glad to
tell you more about it.
