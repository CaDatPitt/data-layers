Constitutional Convention Makes
-Public the Results of ‘Long
Discussion.

DECISION BY BALLOT.
l

Committee Disagrees o"n Advisa-
bility of Entirely New Consti-
‘tution But Concurs on Final
Draft’. ‘ a

After weeks of uncertainty, during
which the members—-or rather a very
small minority of them—-—were labor-
ing hard to frame a new plan _of stud-
ent government, the Constitutional
Convention appointed some months
ago ﬁnally made its .repo1"C. and by
resolutions of the Board of Control

and General Senate, the new consti-.

tution will be submitted next Monday,
April 26. to the student body for
either their approval or rejection
either in whole or section by section.

A close scrutiny of the proposed
basis for better government shows a
number of new features of a greater
or less degree ‘Of the radical nature.
The most prominent_steps in the doc-
ument are the abolishment of the
present board of control and its_ re-
placement by an_ executive committee
directly responsible ‘to the general
cenate, and the ordering of new" elec-
tions—as interpreted by the chairman
of revision—for al_l senators in spite
of the fact that, in some cases, the
present incumbents have served but a
few months of ‘their period of office.

After providing for equal represen-
tations in the various schools in spite
of courses of different lengths, _the
constitution provides that all elections
for senators——except that of one
freshman, head-cheerleader, athletic
committee and the Owl board, shall be
elected at one time, the third Wednes-
day in May. All such elections_ shall
be by printed ballot, the candidates
for oﬁice being required _to present be-
fore nomination a petition signedby
at least ﬁve duly accredited members
of ‘the school or class concerned, at a
certain time before the period set for
the election.

Probably the feature of greatest
izalue. to the new constitution is that
which provides for either the recall or
the automatic dismissal of the mem-
ber of the senate who fulﬁll their
duties to the dissatisfaction of their
constituency. Failure to _attend three
regular meetings of the senate results
in dismissal and new election. - A vote
of twenty per cent of the students _con-
cerned are sufficient for the dismissal
of any student official and the order-
ing of a new election, the dismissed
oﬂicial being graciously permitted to
run for reelection. By. a like vote, any
action of the governing body may be
rejected by the students.

The constitution is printed in full in
this issue and is recommended to the
careful and thoughtful consideration
of all students. The vote on the same
will be by ballot on next Monday.

Having been crippled by the ab-
sence of three members of the Biology

subject last Monday under Dean Fet-

Dr. L. E. Griffin will not meet his
classes for three weeks being detain-

MUSIGAL CLUBS

Additional impetus was given to the
preparations for the Annual Home
Concert of the Musical clubs last week
by the appearance of “Jack” High, a
member of the “Old Guard” and lead-
er of the University Musical clubs for
twelve years. A, . .

.At the request of Manager A. S.
Haines,'Mr. High came out to assist
in the rehearsals for the home event.
As a result, the clubs will present a’
ﬁrst class medley, something which
hs been lacking from the program all
year.

Leader Russell H. Kirk was unable
to attend the rehearsal last week, so
Mr. High availed himself of the op-
portunity to begin work at once. In
a few introductory remarks, he ex-
plained that the purpose of the med-

was an essential part of t e program
in that the audience always expected
a medley at a college glee club con-
cert. . E
‘Following his remarks, he had the
club rehearse a f_ew'numbers and stat-
ed that he would have a medley ar-
ranged for presentation at the home
concert.

the Sterrett School, in Ho-mewood,
where a concert of the usual high or-
der was presented. , ~ '

“The message, of the Cosmopolitan

the club byfsaying that the‘ Cosmopol-

tive racial, pride to build up culture,
literature and science. A I '

Dr. Todd, head of the sociology de-
partment, spoke on the “Elimination
of mob mind.” He said in part, “Much
race prejudice has stirred up uncalled
for fear of different racial movements.
But a thorough study of the problems
of race would show that it is largely
a question of culture. We are con-

INSTITUTE PERFECTS

NEW  

By the discovery of a new method
of constructing glass pots thousands
of dollars will be saved by the glass
industry. This was the announcement
made by the Mellon Institute as the
result of experiments made unde-r one
of the fellowships of the institute.

By the new process, the glass pots,
in which are melted the sand and
chemicals forming the raw materials»
of glass, are given a specially "pre-
pared lining, ’which increases their
durability 50,pe'r cent. It is estimated
that the average factory making lead
glass, and operating two furnaces of
14 pots each, willsave approximately
$7,000 a year through the use of the
new pots. _

Practical tests of the new process,
extending over a considerable period
of time, are said to show that P glass
pots with the new lining will stand

will stand only 20 melts, according to
glass men.

The Mellon Institute discovery has
resulted not only in prolonging the
active life of glass pots. It has ef-
fected, tests show, a corresponding
gain in the quality of glass made in
the glass pots, and a saving of time
and expense in replacing the pots at
the furnaces. ’

Following the discovery in the lab-
oratories of the institute, seven pots
were constructed by the new process
and placed in the factories of an Ohio
valley glass company for tests. On
the ﬁrst trial 33 melts were made in
the pots. A second trial now is in
progress, and the pots are approach-
ing the thirty-ﬁrst melt. ’

Glass pots are made of an especially
selected‘ ﬁre clay, which formerly was
imported almost entirely from Germ-
any. In recent years large deposits
of American clays have been found
notably in Missouri, quite as good for

STATE CONFERENCE

Y. M. C. A. Presidents Meet Here
For First Time in History of
the University. ~

Plans for the coming State Y. M.
C. A. Presidents’ conference, to be
held here under the auspices of the
University of Pittsburgh Y.‘ M. C. A.
Friday, "Saturday and Sunday, April
30 to May 2, are rapidly takingﬁnal
shape, and will be entirely complete
before the ﬁrst delegate reaches Pitts-
burgh next week. ’ 

The program, the arrangement of
which is entirely in the hands of the
State secretary, J. H. Ehlers of Har-
risburg, is not quite ready for publi-
cation, but enough has been announced
to indicate the extremely high quality
of the speakers, and their subjects.
Four’léadin'g' Y. M. C. A. workers
have sent their acceptances, and will
‘be on the program positively, while
several other prominent leaders have
made tentative arrangements to be
present. Among those deﬁnitely
promised are. Harison S. Eliot, Bible
Study Chairman ofthe International
Committee of the Y. M. C. A., Rich-
ard R. Edwards, the Social Service
Chairman of the same body, Walter
J. Campbell, and Paul Micou, the sec-
retary for the Eastern states of the
national organization. In addition,
Frank N. D. Buchman, the live-wire
general secretary of the State College
Association and Thomas St. Clair
Evans who ﬁlls a similar post at the
University of Pennsylvania, are ex-
pected to be on hand for part of the
conferenceat least. The Student Vol-
unteer Movement will also be repre-
sented by one of its traveling secre-
taries.

The delegates will be entertained in
the fraternity houses, and in _ the
homes of faculty members, students,
and private persons. Places for al-
most all of the large number of dele-
gates who are expected, have been
provided, but several are still needed,
and the committee announces that it
will be glad to hear from anyone who
will be able‘ to’ receive one or more
guest for the appointed time. A sys-
tem of secretaries is being worked
out, which will assign one Pitt student
to every stranger, to meet him at the
station uponhis arrival, conduct him
to the University, where the delegates
will be registered, and from thence to
his \place bf entertainment. These
secretaries will also assist generally
in giving the delegates ‘all’ needed in-
formation, and in showing them the
hospitality of the University. .

The general outline of the progress
calls for an opening session on Fri-
day evening, open to thedelegates and

sociations, followed by a reception and

Oratorical honors have again been
-brought to the University by the win-
ning of the state contest in the Inter-
collegiate Prohibition Associationby
Clarence A. Wagner, Col."18, at Car-
lisle last Friday. D. E.‘ Daniels, treas-
.l1..I‘eI‘ of the local club accompanied
Wagner.

The‘ second prize went to Homer M.
Respess of Dickinson College while
Edgar G. Diehm of Juniata College
and Harry S. Dando of Lebanon Val-
ley Colege received honorable. men-
tion. .There were contestants entered
from Bucknell University, Susquehan-
na University, Pennsylvania State
College, and Pennsylvania College. in
addition to the winners named. _

“Delusions of Alcohol” was the sub-
ject of Wagner's oration. It was full
of sound reasoning and proven facts
and was delivered in a strai‘ght-froi'n-
the-sholulder expressive manner. _ -The
other orators offered a brand of
speech that was of high order so that
the decision of the judges was a vic-
tory well worth while.‘

The preliminary of the contest was
judged on manuscript alone. A short
time ago Wagner received word that
his composition had been accepted and
that he would be admitted as a con-
testant at the Carlisle event. The
ﬁrst contest which was held in this
city carried a prize of $15 and the
recent contest made our star orator
the ,-richer by $40.

At this convention Wagner was
elected Vice President of the State In-
tercollegiate Prohibition Association
and was placed on the ﬁnance com-
mittee. . Other interesting sessions
were held in conjuction with the ora-
torical contest.

In July the winners of the state
prizes inthe division of which Penn-
sylvania is one will meet at Atlantic
City to compete for the Division prize.

visions will be assembled _, December

POPULARITY CONTEST

The Popularity cdntesti being con-

ducted by the Liggett & Meyers
jg Tobacco CO. has created considerable
interest in this University as it has

done in other schools. The manufact-

.urers of the; “famous” Fat,-Emma are‘

offeringan Indian Motorcycle to the
most popular student in Pitt or Tech

_ as evidenced by the number of to-
» bacco votes —*he can garner between

now and_May 31.‘

So far as is known Cheerleader Red
Irvine, Stewart Gray Pete Heil, Jerry}
Black,-and Louis Fernberg, Phar., are‘
candidates for the prize in, Pitt. It
is not known who the aspirants are at
Tech. The only candidate who is
making any demonstration about the
contest is our red-topped yeller who
has signs on the bulletin boards an-
nouncing himself as the one to be
voted for.

The object in the contests so far as
the school goes is to poll as many total
votes as possible and to have the Win-
ner be a Pitt man. This, because for
every coupon deposited during the
contest will be paid‘ one-half cent to
the athletic committee of the school
which the "winner attends. This is no
mean sum as the amount received. by
the athletic authorities in a recent
contest at Ohio State was. between
three and gfourthousand dollars. As
there are two schools in this contest
instead of one there should be more
than the usual number’ of ballots cast.

SIUDENIMANAGEMENT

Manager and Two A‘s's‘istaiits Elected;
‘Attractive Plans Being, Laid to In-
sure Success For 1916. ‘

 

Thefounding of a permanent ad-
ministrati e organization of debaters
involving. he election of manager and
two assistants, and the -placing of the
management of the teams forfuture
years upon precisely the same practi-
cal basis as the mode of operation of
other University activities last Friday

after assembly,» marks the ﬁrst great ‘

move in a-" series of steps toward plac-
ing debating in the position it right-
fully deserves, as the most popular in-
door activity of the school‘. '
The meeting was called by B.‘ M.
Selekman, Econ. ’15, toodisouss plans
for-the c_oming: year. It wasalmost
unanimously decided, after consider-
able discussion, that the one‘ thing
necessary to placingforensics inethe
future on a solid workingbasis, both
ﬁnancially and in regard tothe qual-
ity of the teams, was the reduction of
the activity to student management
entirely. Accordingly, the following
members. were, elected for "this pur-
pose: Fred W. Glaser, Econ. ’16, man-
ager; Edwin G. Beorge,"Col. ’17, and
Ben Lencher, Econ. ’18, assistant man-
agers, thus providing for the ﬁnan-

cial and travelling management of the
teams. for three consecutive -seasons.

The duties of the manager are to be
all-inclusive. ' He .. shall conclude ar-
rangements with the Advisory Board
for "the amount of the annual appro-
priation to. forensics; he shall arrange
a complete schedule for the several
teams of each season; he shall, pre-
ferably at the end of each season, ar-
range extensive ‘trips for the -next
year. ,.
— According to the latest reports,
plans for the 1916 season are already
well‘ under way. Tentative arrange-
ments" have already been considered
by Manager ‘Glaser for one and per-
haps two extensive trips at the close
of theregiular season. One of these
plans propose a- trip through New
York, including such institutions as
Cornell university, Buffalo, University
of New York, and our old-time enemy,
Allegheny college. Another proposes
a similar excursion through Pennsyl-
vania, including Lafayette, Lehigh,
Swartlimore, New’ York, Penn, Juni-
ata, and State; while still a third
arrangements may be completed by
which a team will be sent through
Ohio, meeting such notable schools as
Hiram college, Ohio university, Ohio
State, Otterbein, and Oberlin, as well
as various institutions in and around
Cleveland. While of course these ar-
rangements -are as yet but tentative,
there = is scarcely any doubt that one,
and perhaps two of such trips may be
e. : :

toward the establishment at ‘Pitt of
a chapter of one of the larger‘hOnor-
arye debating and oratorical fraterni-
ties of the country. Marked encour-
agement toward thepursuit of such a
course.was received from a special rep-
resentative ‘from one of these frater-
nities, and _ accordingly Fred W.

Glaser, Edwin B. George, and .W. C.‘

Arther were appointed to look into
this matter and .,report at the next
meeting. If such alrecognition could

institution seems to voice_ most effect-
ively the wish nearest the heart of
every baseball fan at Pitt this after-
noon.

It is seldom that a college team has
been so fortunate in the general char-
acter of its players than has Pitt.
There simply is not a weak depart-
inenton the team. Of pitchers there
IS a ﬁne aggregation, the bases are
held down‘ and the remainder of the
inﬁeld represented by the speediest ,
combination of players on a university

thatcan be gathered. From the per-
sistant way that men have stayed in. ‘

for the past .two weeks it is possible
to make. a shrewd guess as to who will
occupy the positions when the umpire
gives the long awaited command.
Inthe case of the batteries the

probably either Beattie or Matson will
crouch behind the bat to receive the

to_' perform at second. Capt, Healyl
will be the short stop. DeHart will,
without reasonable doubt, guard the
third corner. In the out ﬁeld the
choice hangs between Dillon, Engle- «-
hart, Jim Morrow and Geisel.

The front presented by the oppon-
ents, according to the official point of
view, will include a number of new

BACK TO THE PEOPLE.

Reforming is a nice pastime, but it
would never do for a means of acquir-
ing one’s bread and butter. Of that
t we are convinced by the saddening ex-
erience of constitution-framing.
owever, now that the bloody busi-
ness is oil’ our minds, we are willing
to allow the result to speak for itself.
It ‘would possibly appear out of place
for us in our present position, to take
advantage of the" editorial column to
advocate a constitution in which we
had a thumb, with the possibility of a
partisan construction being put upon
our words. We simply ask the student
(body at large to give the new docu-
ment a careful and complete reading,
and upon comparison with the one
which it is to supersede, give their
frank and candid judgment as to the
relative governmental value of the
two codes. At the election to be held
next Monday, at the call of the Presi-
dent of the Board of Control, every
student will be given a free oppor-
tunity to express his convictions upon
the issue, by ballot, voting either to

accept or reject the constitution en-

tire, or against particular articles
‘which. may not please him. Finally,

A let us ask everyone to believe that we

are all working toward the same ulti-
mate end, all looking to the golden
‘age of student government in the Uni-
versity _‘of Pittsburgh, all putting
every ounce of our energy into the
‘improvement of existing conditions. If
these considerations are honestly faced
we believe there will be no room left
for antagonism or personal advant-
age.

 

CHRISTIAN STATECRAFT.

The announcement that George Ed-

‘ dy, Yale graduate, International Sec-
” retry for Asia of the Young Men’s

Christian Association, and world-
famous missionary authority and
practician, will ﬁll a four-days pro-

, gram in Pittsburgh, on Thursday, Fri-

day, Saturday and Sunday of this
week, is cause for congratulation to
the student body of the University of

"Pittsburgh. The schedule which Mr.

Eddy will endeavor to carry out is

I printed in the news columns of THE
_ WEEKLY, and should be exmined by

every student. The items of more
particular interest to the University
are three in number: Tomorrow
night’s open meeting at Carnegie

 Hall, at which Mr. Eddy will give an

address upon “The Present Crisis in

the Chinese Republic;” Friday morn-

ing's assembly, when Mr. Eddy will
speak especially to the student body
of the University; and a conference
on Saturday morning between the dis-
tinguished guest and the undergradu-
ate religious leaders of the Univer-
sity. Of the first event, it is only
necessary to mention the fact that

g. for four years, Mr. Eddy has been in
- -the most intimate touch with the in-
~ dustrial, political, educational, -and re-

ligious life of the great Celestial re-
public, and has held two extensive

it ‘ evangelistic cmpaigns throughout the

nation, which have attracted the at-

 tention of the entire Christian world.
 There is no American on the platform
' with a wider or more exact knowledge

..of conditions in the Orient than
‘George Sherwood Eddy. The meeting

, tomorrow evening will be worthy the

attention of any man or woman. who

’ '?»thinks in cosmopolitan terms. There

can be no excuse, further, for slumber
or absence from chapel this’ Friday
morning. If our assembly program
has not maintained the level it should
have reached this.year, this one oc-
casion should redeem it, for Eddy is
noteworthy for the force, persuasive-
ness and lucidity of his public utter-
ances. Let no student overlook this

; unequalled ‘opportunity to hear and

become acquainted: with one of the

.world’s foremost religious leaders nnd
 one of the world's most useful. citi-
sens. '

“PLAY BALL!"

blooded American of the species indig-
enous to Old Uni, it ought to encom-
pass a healthy fraction of the joy of
living just to watch that blonde-haired
Eddie-boy from Altoona whipping ’em
across that plate, in close proximity,
but not in contact with the mallets

LETTER BOX

EDitor PITT WEEKLY:-—

When we come to any careful. con-
sideration of the proposed revised ver-
sion of the constitution for the control
of student government as presented
by King Ken. and his advisers, there
are- one or two points upon which
any student of the science of consti-
tutional government-—liowever super-
ﬁcial the student may be--must cer-
tainly take exception. So as a mem-
ber of the old senate, and one who
has already announced his intention
of not being a candidate for reelection,
the writer feels free to enter upon
such a discussion. _

The first question which naturally
arises is that “Whether or not it is
expedient to set up the precedent of
sweeping out the whole existing stud-
ent government whenever a few dis-

a change ‘of air?” Under the new
plan, the members of the former
body who were elected in January for
the term of one year are asked to
submit within a couple of months to
another election. If such an order is
justiﬁable, why not have another elec-
tion in June and all the other months
as well as in May? Moreover when
we revise our present constitution of
state or country, are we in the habit
of sweeping out our officials in the
midst of their terms?

But in addition the same Domesday
Book contains provisions for the re-
call of members who are ineﬁicient.
Now why is it necessary to sweep out
the existing senate in a body when
you can remove all the inefficient ones
under your recall? Is it that some-
one has a personal enmity ‘for some-
one in this august body whom they
can not get out on the ground of in-
eﬁiciency? This provision also calls
for the removal of any officer by a
twenty per. cent vote of the students
concerned. Now in every election
which is warmly contested the oppo-
sition controls at least that ‘propor-
tion of votes. If so desired, is it not
possible for the said opposition to con-
stantly recall such member and so
preventthat member from taking his.
elective position?

Another provision provides that both
the senators of the class shall be
elected at the same time, thus chang-
ing thecontinvuous body to a tempor-
ary and changing body. When in
1787 our forefathers gathered to
frame a national constitution, this
same matter arose almost a century
and a half ago. The decision was in
favor of a continuous body because of
the needed experience. Now are our
learned friends of the constitutional
committee wiser than Washington,
Hamilton, Jefferson, Madison, and all
that renowned roll, that they should
presume to turn aside this time-hon-
ored policy in favor of the plan which
the founders of our system rejected?
To one who has endeavored to keep
himself as far from prejudice as any
one could desire—-and it is his honest
belief that the proposed document con-
tains some excellent features—it looks
as if the’ desire of the members of
the committee to set down their
names as the promrulgators of a real
literary constitution for the minds of
posterity, has so far blinded both the
eyes of reason and discretion as to
lead them far beyond the bounds of

common sense.

CREDIT NECESSARY. A .

It is practically a' settled fact that
collegiate credit is necessary as an
incentive to good work in debate.
Many of the best men cannot afford
the great amount of time spent in the
work unless they get some return,
and the coach cannot hold his team
to regular _work without the privilege
of revoking credit to be used as 9.
club. There is at present a solution
of this problem in the air whichrit is
believed will ﬁnd favor with the fac-
ulty. It is an extension of a plan
which was barely started here last
year, but fell through. The idea is to
have an economics course on the gen-
eral subject of the debate, with par-
ticular attention to the matters con-
sidered in the question itself, and an
oratory course given in the second
semester open only to the varsity
teams, consisting in large part of drill
on the debate speeches and rebuttal
work. If" this is carried through there
will certainly be small ground «for
complaint on the subject of credit.

GETTING THE HABIT.

worth getting and worth taking away
and it is about the only sure and
tangible asset that -the average stu-
dent is able to rescue from the nec-
essary confusion of a four years’
college course. *

The power to work does not mean
merely the spending of hours of hope-
less and ineﬂicient toiling with books.
It means the ability to get at_an ap-
pointed task at an appointed time; to
do the work in the shortest possible
time consistent with accuracy and not
only to do this once under the pres-
sure of semester examinations, but to
do it regularly, habitually and without
the necessity of outside pressure.

We often solace ourselves with the
thought of what we could do if we
would. But not what we might do
but what we punctually do is the real
man's test for a man's work.

LAW FEVER.

' We in America are unfortunately
affected with the Law Fever! That is
to say, we are obsessed by the all-
magical powers of the statute-—a veri-
table panacea of all civil, criminal,
political, public, private, and all other
evils.

No matter what is the matter with
anything, anywhere, any time, any
place: our ﬁrst thought is for a law.
We then arouse a great" agitation,
force’ our legislature to pass one of
these magic laws, and then sit back
to take our well-earned rest, while
the law cures the evil. We are all
satisﬁed and content; we have created
the wonderful law—-—what more need
we do? ,

As soon as the unsuspecting public,
rocked into a contented political leth-
argy, has turned its attention else-
where and forgotten all about the
precious law, the untiring, never--
sleeping politician comes along and
knocks that law out with one solid
crack. And the trusting public sleeps
on.

3 A splendid planwas started by the
class of 1910—the ﬁrst’ class to gradu-
ate‘ from the Schenley Farms campus

, —-—when they planted a class tree dur-

ing the commencement seasonof 1913.

. This tree stands near the Engineering

building and is a hardy- “youngster”
destined to someday be large. enough
to shelter the “old grads” of 1910- and
their families when they come back
to: Alma Mater, twenty-ﬁve or ﬁfty
years hence., The _1914 -class “fol-
lowed suit” and planted a tree near

ment season.. Near both trees are

1 bronze tablets, giving the numerals

of the class. I ., 0 .
It is suggested that the classes hav-

’ ing trees follow the tradition of hav-

ing a gathering each re-union under

retary will have a photographer» on
the ground -on Alumni Day for that
purpose. ’ The pictures, year by year,
will tell their‘story of the growth of
the tree and of the branching out of

the‘ reunion class.‘ ' ‘

All the classmates will doubtless
want a collection of these photo-
graphs. 4 It has also been ‘suggested
that the classes each reunion .year
adopt the slogan “Back to the Old
Class tree.”

If any of theaclasses, scheduled for
reunions which do not have a class
-tree. on the campus desire to plant
one the Alumni Secretary will be very
glad, indeed, to arrange "all details.
We have a ﬁne new campus that we
are growing more and more proud of
as the landscape gardeners complete
their work and we want to have it
dotted with little mementoes that will
sew the Alumni up to the Old School.
We know’ of Alumni already, members

the campus with friends and show
them -their_ -class tree. -It’ is
traditions that keep the love for old
Alma -Mater ever burning.

The \class ‘of 1912, at the time of
graduation,'had a fund of something
over-$200 fora class memorial. Sev-
eral "things were suggested and it is
now understaad that the class will
erect a.ﬂa"g pole on the campus, with
suitable inscription, showing it dedi-
cated to the 1912’ers. _We spoke of
this in the Alumni Columns last week
and now note that the ICampus Me-
morial Committee, of which Dr. S. B.
Linhart, Secretary of the University,
is chairman, is considerin the mat-
ter. L."W. McIntyre‘ is president of
:the 1912 class and he has secured
from the,,,Alumni Secretary a list of
all the members’ of that class in the
undergraduate schools with the idea
of getting the class _ reunion idea
worked up. Notices wil1‘~go out to
them in the very near future. Mr.
McIntyre’s address is"3317 Ridgeway

In last week’s Alu/mni Colvumns we
printed a letter from E. L. Esta-_
brook ’13, (Mines) from far off China,
he being employed with the Standard
Oil Company in investigations for oil
and gas. ‘The ‘letter was a mighty
interesting“ one and we have heard
many comments regarding it.

We have another “long distan_c_e”
letter this week from Rev. Raymond
L. Archer of the class of (1911. Rev.
Archer is remembered by all the Pitt
men having taken an‘ active part in
all of the student activities while in
the University. He is now a mission-
ary for the Methodist Episcopal
church, at \Buitenzorg, Java, andhas

there. V __ y - V

" The letter is dated March 5th and
he states thathe expects to be here
shortly after its arrival, as he has se-
cured a furlough. ' I, » '

Friends will all be gladto welcome
him back home. The letter follows:
“Mr. K. E. Davis, '10.-

Pittsburgh, Penna.

Dear Davis: -

Just ‘the other .day received your
notice regarding the ‘Alumni Associa-
tion dues. I expect to start for Am-
erica within two weeks, as my fur-
lough will be due then, and will set-
tle the bill when I reach Pittsburgh,
which will be not long after the ar-
rival of this letter. 4

The English School in Buitenzorg,
of which I have been the principal,
has been making good growth and we
are expecting great things of the
only American school in. Java.

A few weeks ago» I was in Singa-
pore and had a greattexperience. Per-
haps you have heard of the Bengalic
Mutiny which occurred in that city a
short while ago. The mutineers were
a ‘regiment of Indian soldiers, about
800 in number. For one week we had
a very exciting time.
the fact. that most of ' the A English
-soldiers had gone to Europe the city
was almost at‘ the mercybf the muti-
neers. However, the civilians volun-
teered and they were held in check
until a large number ,of English,
:French and Japanese marines arrived
iand then we made quick work of it.
I was among the volunteers and have
had some experiences which will re-
main with me for some time. I, have
some very deﬁnite recollections of the
ﬁring line, of lying in the trenches, of
seeing wounded men rolling on the
ground. and of .1ot-of other things
which I can not mention now.

' Sincerely, -
R. L. ARCHER, ’11.”

..CH08EN FOB  
   PENN MEET

 

The cloudéwhich has so long over-
hcastthe athletic heavens of the Uni-

1; versity has been dissipated, dissolved

intogthin air and no-longer obscures
the brightness of the Pitt sky. We
’ have a relay team of the ﬁrst order.
Thefears to the contrary were com-
pletely unfounded as was amply mani-
fested by the splendid. result of the
ﬁnal trials for the Penn meet which
were held on Monday afternoon.
Monday afternoon the seven contes-
tants for the Blue and Gold relay team
faced a high wind and made a record
iwhicli has been blue penciled by the
cable censor lest it completely dis-
courage the prospective opponents of
the coming season. Burwell, Mays,
Grumbling, Cook, Canan, Thomas,vand
McGinnis were the competitors, ﬁn-
ishing in the order named, and so
great was the spirit of rivalry be-
tween these men that the interest
aroused was more than is ordinarily
manifested toward such trials.
Burwell assumed the lead at the

I outset though he was hard pushed to-

‘ward the last by Grumbling and Mays.
Burwell ran an admirable race and the
. ease with which he hit his stride
marked him as a great runner.
Grumbling was all on his nerve, be-
ing handicapped more completly by
the high wind which seemed at times
almost to lift him from his feet. He
took the second place early in the run
and pushed Burwell hard at the ﬁn-

I '. ish but lost the next to leader posi-

tion to Mays by a hair in the last few
strides. Mays ran the hardest, most
marked run“ of the day. He took an
easy start and stayed well back until
possibly one.-half of the distance had

een covered when he made a wonder-
ful sprint which was continued until
he outdistanced his immediate lead-

’ ers, passed Grumbling, and ﬁnished
‘ but a stride behind Burwell.

, So deep was the interest exhibited
toward the outcome of this trial for
the Penn meet that a large number

of the students negotiated the hill for

“the expressed purpose of pa ing their

1 tribute‘ to the runners by t eir pres-
 ence. When the starting gun whipped
“the spring air with its stacato crack,
 the men of the baseball squad, who

, were in the midst of an exciting prac-
. tice game, immediately dropped every-
‘- thing and thronged the sides of the

' (track to watch the outcome of the

contest.

With Burwell, .Mays, Grumbling,

and Cook, who were the ﬁrst to ﬁnish,

-6 to represent Pitt in ‘the relay races of

“‘the coming season it is assured that
the University will be defended by

.. one of the best aggregations in its
-‘class that has worn the Pitt colors

for a number of years and it is cer-
tain that they will ring up a good
record for Western Pennsylvania at

 the Pennsylvania trials.

 

TO MEET W. &J.

In the midst of the hurry and the
excitement of the preparation for. the

"1 . Penn meet the dual affair with W. &
 J. is not being forgotten and the men
L_ are being prepared for both races.

T This meet which was to have been

 held ‘on the Schenley Oval was origin-

: ally set for the eighth of May but ow-

?~.ing to some unforseen difficulty, it

became necessary to set the date back

— to the seventh of the same month.
The Washington and Jefferson sup-
porters are putting forward great
claims for their track men this year,
 but with the form that the Pitt men
are showing the Washingtonian crowd
will have to measure fully up to the
‘claim made for them with some pos-
' sible-addition if they hope to carry

6 away from the Blue and Gold city
 the trophy for this meet.

The Pitt men as well as the Red
and Black men have a schedule which
will tax their powers to the uttermost.
The one most noteworthy is the clash
with Syracuse which follows, closely
after the Pennsylvania meet? ' These
two affairs will be sure to put the
University innners in the best of trim
for the contest with their ancient riv-
als on the seventh of May.

Pitt has a ﬁne relay team and may
be justly proud of it but it would tax
their ability to bring back the twelve

the energetic push of Ted Fry’s right

TENNIS TEAM WILL -
VBE CHOSEN SOON.

 

The tournament that is being held

to determine who shall be on the Var-
sity tennis team has reached the semi-
ﬁnals, and these will be played off this
week. Evans, Meyers, Haines, Will-
son, McGrew, and Pyle, are still in the
running. All those that did not Show
up for the matches were declared inel-
igible. The winners of the semi-ﬁn-
als will play the members of last
years team for the positions on the
team. The ﬁnals will be run off as
soon as possible in order that practice
may start, for the season is near at
hand. The ﬁrst scheduled match is
with Penn State on May seventh. The
eastern trip begins about the 10th of
May.
Saturday’s matches resulted as fol-
lows: Evans worsted Rust in straight
sets 6-2, 6-4; Daugherty defeated
Cameron 6-3, 6-1;
South in two hotly contested sets 7-5
and 6-4; ‘Evans defeated Daugherty
6-2 and 6-1; Haines sent Cole down
to defeat 6-1, 6-0.

EDGEWOOD HIGH
BEATEN BY CO-EDS.

The Pitt lasses demonstrated the
fact that their basket ball aggrega-
tion was superior to any of the high
school sextets of the section by the
decisive defeat which they administer-
ed to the feminine collection of basket
ball tossers from the Edgewood High
School in a whirlwind contest at the
Trees Gymnasium early last week.
The game was one of the fastest that
has yet been participated in by the
co-ed squad and the resultant score
of 18-11 was particularly gratifying
to every supporter of the team by
reason of the fact that the Edgewood
girls were the peers of all the High
School teams of the section.

As usual Miss Wehmier was the
star of the Pitt girls, and she succeed-
ed in placing four goals from the floor
and accomplishing six out of seven of
the foul shots at which she made a
trial. -

the Advisory Board last week, by a
,committee of the club following the
action of the active members.

It is planned to reorganize the plan
of membership, and pattern it after
other institutions. Work on a new
constitution has begun and will be
presented to the board at a laterdate.

There will be three classes of mem-
bers of the club; active, honorary and
alumni. After a student appears -in
two different productions, he becomes
an active member, has full ‘power to
vote and take a part in the affairs of
the club, and will still be a member
after he becomes an alumnus. —

The club will still be under th

in this part of the state and their fail-

WRESTLING WORK
WILL BE CONTINUED.

 

The wrestling season of the present
school year has been numbered with
its fathers, but there is no disposition
on the part of the members of the
"squad to relax the strenuous work that
is absoliutely necessary during the en-
tire year in order to assure a fall-
securing aggregation for 1916.

At the present time the outcome, of
the'eﬂ"'orts to retain Reinecke as coach
are still in doubt but manager Ray
Huff has a plan of action which will
place in the hands of next. year’s in-
structor the record of each man dur-
ingthe spring and fall work outs. It.
is proposed to have each man report
to practice at least two times each
week and on one of those times have
set matches between the men of the
same weight. A record will be kept of

I the result of these bouts which will be

placed in the hands of next year’s
coach; thus providing him with the
means of making an accurate estimate
of the quality of the men of the squad
at the outset of the "season.

It has been arranged with the head
of the Physical Education dgpartnient
to give credits to those who practice
regularly during the ﬁnal term of this
school year, if some satisfactory ar-
rangement can be effected whereby a
dependable record may be kept of the
number of hours spent in practice by

each men during that time. A meeting‘

has been held for the purpose of ar-
ranging a schedule for the men of the
regular squad and such others as wish
to take up the mat game in place
of their regular gym Work and it is
fully expected that some plan will be
arrived at which ‘will give satisfac-
tion to those in charge of the depart-
ment.

HURRAH FOR THE GIRLS!

The victory of the Pitt debaters over
those of Westminster was indeed a
great triumph forthe co-eds. The
girls, to be sure, did not take an act-
ive part in the altercation, but Pitt's
victory was due primarily to our rep-
resentatives’ emulation of the femin-
ine blandishments daily displayed so
enchantingly upon the campus. Who
is that cavalier who has not marvel-
ed at and envied the brilliant ﬂuency
of some charming co-ed, or admired
her composure under circumstances
which would render confusion easily
excusable. Yes, the dear young ladies
are undoubtedly our most talented
orators.

Take, for instance, our pretty Miss
Gossip—who can rival her for pure
loquacity? It was only last week that
I met her at assembly; and after we
had seated ourselves comfortably to-
gether, she immediately launched out
into an exposition of the unspeakable
cruelty of certain instructors in im-
posing fortnightly tests upon their
frail pupils; a dissertation on the ad-
vantages of co-education followed
(with which, by the way, I heartily
agreed); next there was a very elab-
orate analysis of the spring head-
dress (interesting albeit unintellig-
ible); a recapitulation of a dance en-
sued; followed by an extremely clever
bit of slander. When the dismissal of

.assembly rudely interrupted her be-

witching narrative, I was deeply in-
terested in the precocious wit of her
be y brother, who, as she confessed,
W s expected to say “da-da” as soon
as he cut a certain tooth that was
d adfully slow coming. So skeptical
was I that I glanced at my watch to
see if it was in truth 12:30; and I
must admit that the assembly hour
never passed more speedily and more
enjoyably.

After assembly, at the wish of Miss
Gossip, I attended the luncheon which

the co-eds served, Baltimore Dairy
style, in Thaw Hall. There I --met a
younw lady whom I believe may

judiciously be called a coquette. She
was a past master of action, which
Demosthenes declared was the ﬁrst,
second, and third esential of oratory;
and indeed she seemed to speak for
no other‘ reason than that it gave her
an opportunity of moving a limb,
changing a feature, or ﬂirting an eye.
She sighed when she was not sad, and
smiled when she was not merry; she
gave voice to but few words, and yet
withal she seemed most voluble: a sly
glance spoke volumes. Indeed it was
amusement to see a stalwart, robust
athlete bowled over with a single
smile from her. And he secretly con-
fessed to me afterwards that he quite
agreed with Demosthenes.

As I was leaving the room after
luncheon, I was surprised when a
member of the debating team seized
me by the arm.

“We are going to win tonight,” he
said, in a voice tremulous with emo-
tion. “I have been watching your
friends; they have taught me the true
Rrinciples of oratory. And while I

ave always been able to talk upon
some things for a whole hour, they
have taught me how to speak an hour
upon nothing. And as for facial ex-
pression, I say ‘Hurrah for the

, girls!’ "

THE DYESTUFF SITUATION.

According to Dr. Raymond F.
Bacon, Director of the Mellon Insti-
tute, University of Pittsburg, the
British Government will have a dye-
stuff industry well under way while
the United States is discussing it.

A few days ago, representatives of
the American textile manufacturers
called at the State Department in

 Washington and declared that A-mer-
 ican textile mills would have to close

SAMUEL BLACK LINHART.

In any consideration of the men who
have played an important part in the
remarkable development of the Uni-
versity in the last decade, the man
who naturally takes second place in
the series both because of his work
and because of his able and eﬂicient
co-operation with the present head of
the institution is Samuel Black Lin-
hart, the Secretary of the University
and of the Board of Trustees.

Dr. Linhart was born in the vicinity
of Irwin, on November 12, 1865, and
after a boyhood spent in the same
region, he entered the employ of the
Mellon Banking ﬁrm. It was during
this time that he prepared for col-
lege, matriculating at the University
of Wooster, and graduating from that
institution in 1891 with the degree of
A. B. After two years at the Auburn
Theological Seminary in New York,
he came to the Western Theological
Seminary of this city and graduated
in 1894. The same year he secured
his master’s degree at Wooster.

In the fall of that year, Dr. Linhart
was ordained in the Presbyterian
Ministry and established as the pastor
of the Forty-third Street Church,
where he remained for four years. In
1898, he resigned his pastorate in
order to take charge of the Blairsville
College for Women. During his
regime there of eight years, the latter
institution enjoyed a new era of pros-
perity and progress, and of unrivalled
growth. In 1906, shortly after the
advent of Chancellor McCormick, Dr.

ﬁll the position he now holds at the
Linhart wa sbrought to Pittsburgh to
University. Here he has charge of
the business side of the University,
superintending an enormous mass'of
intricate detail relating to the ﬁnan-
cial interests of this institution. In
addition to this work, he has taught
Ethics and the various courses of Re-
ligion. He was awarded his degree
of D.D. from Wooster in 1906, when
he became Secretary of the Univer-
sity.

Like the Chancellor, with whom he
has been so closely and intimately as-
sociated, Secretary Linhart has played
an important part in the recent de-
velopment of the University from the
small institution of the North Side to
its present position among the educa-
tional centers of the country. The
exact position which he occupies in
this progress it is, of course, impos-
sible to estimate, but never before has
the Universi-”' ;of Pittsburgh enjoyed
a period of“ ’ owth and successful
administration which by any means
rivals that under the two “Samuel
Black’s” now at the head of its affairs.

Secretary Linhart is also a member
of the American Asociation for the
Advancement of Science, the Academy
of Science and Art, and the Western
Pennsylvania Historical Society. In
the sphere. of social activity,“ Dr.‘Lin-
hart is a member of Delta Tau Delta,
the Sons of the American Revolution,
and of the University Club and the
Pittsburgh Athletic Association.

   

unless the Government could do some-
thing to bring dyestuffs out of Ger-
many. A report was sent out from
Washington, on Wednesday, saying
that the British Government had
agreed to permit two cargoes of Ger-
man dyestuffs to sail from Rotterdam.
Dr. Bacon, in discussing the situa-
tion, said: “Of course, these cargoes,
even if they are permitted to come to
this country, will do very little to re-
lieve the sitution. In December last,
the Department of Commerce assign-
ed Thomas H. Norton, a skilled in-
vestigator of chemical industries, to
report on the feasibility of establish-
ing a dyestuﬂ’ industry in this coun-
try. His report is about ready and
will be received with great interest.
It may be of interest to know that
the committee of users of dyes in
England appointed to confer with the
British Board of Trade as to a na-
unanimous decision as to the method
of procedure. The proposal is to form
a company with an initial share cap-
ital of $10,000,00 of which $5,000,000
will be issued in the ﬁrst instance.
The Government will make to the
company a loan for twenty-ﬁve years
corresponding to the amount of share
capital subscribed up to a total of
$5,000,000 and a similar portion be-
yond that total. The government ad-
vance will bear interest at 4 per cent.
per annum, payable only out of net
proﬁts, the" interest to be cumulative
only after the ‘ﬁrst ﬁve years. In ad-
dition, and with the desire of promot-
ing research, the government has un-
dertaken for a period of ten years to
make a grant to the company for the
purposes of experimental and labora-
tory work up to an amount not ex-
ceeding in the aggregate $500,000.”

COLLEGIATE ANTI-
MILITARISM LEAGUE.

Efforts at many colleges to stir up
a dangerous militarist spirit, and in
some cases to introduce a system of
military training, seemed to a num-
ber of college men to offer a serious
enough proposition to warrant the
calling of a -meeting in New York
several weeks ago to consider the sit-.
uation. At this meeting there were
present representatives from_ Har-
vard, Princeton, Yale, Columbia, Cor-
nell, Pennsylvania, and New York
University.

The result of this meeting was the
formation of the “Collegiate Anti-
Militarism League,” which aims to
set before men in all the colleges of
the country the need of direct and
forceful agitation against militarist
tendencies and propaganda.

The college is not the place to in-
stitute military training, but quite
apart from that question we must

also consider what will be the tragic ,

results of furthering the militaristic
spirit at "this time. Before us lies an
opportunity such as has never before
been, presented to a» nation. Shall we
plan great increases in our army and
navy, shall we pass bills appropri-

ating to the uses of . war still more

of that Federal Revenue of which 72
per cent. is at the, present time being
spent on the Army and Navy, shall
we start even to train our college
men to ﬁght, and then go to the
warring nations of Europe, offer our-
selves as mediator in the struggle,
propose as one of the conditions of
peace some sort of a disarmament
agreement——and expect them. to re-
ceive these good oﬁlces otherwise
than with sneers?

The newly founded organization is
planning an active campaign against
militarist agitators, whether half-in-
formed laymen or professional army
men. It appeals for support in every
college, and asks those men interested
to communicate with the Secretary,
John Temple Graves, Jr., Princeton,
N. J. The other officers are K rl G.
Karsten, Columbia, President; rthur
Fisher, Harvard, Vice-President; and
A. L. Trachtenberg, Yale, Treasurer.

FRESHMAN SPEAKS
AT COLLEGE BANQUET.

 

(Editors Note :—-Through a mistake of the
printer, part of the story of the College
Banquet was omitted from the last issue. The
following completes the item.)

The last speaker of the evening was
Logan Hall with his eulogy of what
the freshmen were, are, and will be
in their growth and development at
Pitt. The evening was closed with
“Hail to Pitt” and a ringing “alle-ge-
nee.” The only part of the program
which was not in harmony with the
evening was the piano, which was sad-
ly “out of tune” with its surroundings.

HOW TO KILL SCIENCE.

An example of the way in which
scientiﬁc ‘investigation is often ham-
pered in this country is communicated
by Prof. E. C. Pickering to Science
(New York, February 19) and printed
in that ‘journal underthe heading, “A
Typical Case.” It is that of a man
who, after taking a doctor’s degree at
his own ‘university, studied abroad,
and then returned to America, full of
enthusiasm for original research. He
had published an important memoir
for a thesis, which was well received;
his instructors encouraged him and his
fellow students appreciated and were
interested in his work. Now note what
happened. Writes Professor Picker-
mg:

' “He received an offer of a professor-
ship in a small country college, mar-
ried, andbegan his new life expecting
to continue his investigations. He
soon found that his entire time was
occupied in teaching, and that he was
obliged to eke out his small salary by
writing and lecturing. He could not
bear to abandon his great object, the
‘advancement of human knowledge,-.
and found that he could, by extra ef-
forts, devote a portion of his evenings
to research, amounting to a fourth of
his entire working capacity. He went
to the president of the college, ask-
ing for'an appropriation for an as-
sistant, who could do the routine work
of copying, computing, etc., as well
and as rapidly as he could himself.
Instead of a quarter of his time, he
would thus have one and a quarter,
or ﬁve ti-mes as much, and could make
rapid progress at small expense.. The
president told him that the object of
the institution was teaching, not re-
search and that it was impossible to
grant his request. A fellowship was,
however, vacant, and might answer his
purpose. This, however, would be of
no use to him, as the fellow would not
want to do routine work, but to under-
take a research of his own, and would
expect to be taught how to do it. His
associates were teachers, not investi-
gators, and took no interest in his
plans. After repeated trials and dis-
couragements, he abandoned his ef-
forts and settled down as a teacher
only, with no ambitions beyond enab-
ling his classes to pass their examina-
tions. While good teachers are as
much needed as investigators, the
work of the latter may be greatly im-
peded if their main energy is devoted
to instruction. The ﬁnding of such
men, and enabling them to carry on
the great work for Which they are ﬁt-
ted by providing them with apparatus,
assistants, or means for publication is
one of the principal objects of the
Committee of One Hundred on Scien-

hear the honeybees buzz in the far-off gardens.

The Perfect Tobacco for Pipe and Cigarette

Sings into your system a song of keen delight.
