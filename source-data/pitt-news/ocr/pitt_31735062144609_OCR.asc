FIRST DOWNS 14 TO 3

 

,. By .TED MEIER '

Pennsylv.a_nia——proud, old Penn—-
felt the heel of another conquerer
last Saturday when the Panthers in-
vaded the Qliakcr City and sent Lou
Young’s- highly-touted eleven down to
a 14 to O defeat on Franklin Field.
Penn was as badly trounced, perhaps
more so, than it - was when Red
Grange and company rainbled through
-its defense at will. Over 65,000 per-
sons witnessed Penn’s second defeat
of the year,

PITT AT TOP

By virtue of their triumph Jock
.Suther1and’s lads take their rightful
right as one of the top-notch elevens
in the country. Visions of a trans-
continental trip, which faded when
Lafayette won early in’ the season,
are again in full -bloom‘. Pitt must at
least be given consideration if the

. Thanksgiving Day classic results in

another defeat for Penn State.

With the great Kreuz back in ‘the
lineup and its team intact for the

first time since the Red Grange rout. I

Penn has no excusefor the beating.
It was the same team which put Yale,
Brown and Chicago down for counts
and which was ranked the equal of
Dartmouth. The story of the game is
~——Pitt had the better team.

SCORE IN FIRST HALF‘

The Panthers scored all their points .

in the first half; after that they were
content to punt and ‘let the Quaker
field general, Leith, send the much
praised Kreuz against the .Pitt for-
ward Iine in vain efforts to gain.
Andy Gustafson carried the leather
over for the ﬁrst score, late in the
first period, afterpa 40-yard forward
pass, followed by several cleverly ex-

ecuted deceptive plays had placed the

ball on Penn’s one-yard line. With
Harding holding the ball, Andy also
added the extra poin.t from placement.
HARDING COUNTS

Spike Harding made the second
touchdown. After Pitt had worked
the ball to the Penn 10, in the second
quarter, Spike started on an end run
around-left end, but reserved his ﬁeld
and scampered across the ﬁnal. chalk
line unmolested. Penn was caught
completely napping on the_ play. '

Throughout the combat, _ Pitt was

‘decidedly superior. Sutherland order-

ed a complete change of tactics from
the Carnegie Tech and W.-J, tussles
with suchgood success that Penn was
constantly bewildered. _ ’

Inste_ad of Gustafson doing the line-

"plunging, Alan Booth performed in

that role, while instead of Welch on

the propelling end of forward passes

Brown was in that capacity. During
all the sixty minutes of battle. Penn
was continually running into a sur-

the last two games, Pitt is credited
with playing smarter football
any hitherto Panther eleven.

Title Race to Take Place on
Monday ‘in New York

 

‘One ‘year ago i‘Monday, Pitt's cross-

and gave Pittsburgh a national’ hill

a shell of that famous barque will
move out to defend the title.» To re-
peat last year's great win would he
ﬁne, but Panther followers, when they
settle their enthusiasm long. enough
to take a good look attthe situation,
can see a hard four-cornered ﬁght at
New York among the fourteen or

thing ébut the strongest of the four,
having been beaten by two of the fav-
orites, Syracuse’ and gsltate, and the
other’s record being far more impres-
sive than that of the locals. But Pitt
is not to be counted out so easily.
The team is certain that lack of ex-
perience on theparts of the new men
is 'its greatest handicap and that if
it can fight that off, it will be hard
to beat. . '' '~

STRONGEST“ TEAMS '

I-larva:-rl, Syracuse. and Penn State
are the three Pitt regards as the pos-
sible winners. When Syracuse and
State met over the State course sev-
eral weeks ago, Syracuse won by a
lone point. "In ‘Pitt's three remaining
meets, the runners won in impressive
style, scoring almost perfect scores
against Allegheny, Carnegie Tech and

ting, heaps of delayed praise. During '

Syracuse has been~.undef'eated' thus
far and numbers wins over Pitt, State
and ‘Columbia, "the last mentioned
having defeated Cornell. Dartmouth,
Penn, and Yale. Harvard easily de-
feated Yale and Princeton._

This year _ﬁnds Pitt a threat, for
not alone is the team a source of wor-
ry but among the members of its
team Pitt boasts astrong entry for
honors in Captain Ted

but he is moving along at much great-
er speed and ‘strength this year and

being forced to run‘ on a strange

course against the best team that;
Penn State has ever produced»-which
included ‘an Olympic runner——-they
ran on almost level ground, making
the run more ”like a three-mile race
than a hill and "dale chase.

PANTHERSINTACTNN

By CHARLES L. EMLEB "  .
Resting on their laurels from the

Penn game for a few days, the Pany -.
there will again start work for the”
oncoming game with Penn State on
Turkey day. State was beaten‘  »
West Virginia last Saturday in t1l.9‘”",’~f‘;‘
dedication game in the Mountaiiieer“ ‘
bowl, but the Lions went down light-
ing and the Panthers do not expect
‘any meek playing from them. ,

Adding to this fact, the Thanksgiv-
ing game is the last that the Panthers
play and everything is dropped then"
and the two teams fight: it out. For
the past "few years, however, Pittﬂ _ _
seems to have had a jinx over the I . 
Lions, no matter how good a team.
they have. But this year, State's out
to break it_ ~ g _

At the early part of the season. _
some of the State players were injur-."’
ed, but they are now back in shape .
and its best line-up will be available.“ , 
Pitt will not be left in the dust, rfor.t-.13
just now the team is in the pink 0! ' 
condition, with {the combination of
Harding, Brown, Welch and Gustaf-
son raring to go, and with such "sub-
stitutes as Schmitt, Booth, Hagan
and McCutcheon ready to go inst
any time. 'When such material is
available, the Panthers need‘ not wor-
ry much about their line-up, but more“ _
about the perfection of their plays‘-: 
and hard training. They will be-giv-‘v ' '
en plenty of time, as no, game will be . , .
