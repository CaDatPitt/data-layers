_If‘ plans for a Pitt stadium that
were drawn up by two engineering

ized. a. half-_d'ozen decks would have
been needed to make it even the size

be‘ opened next fall.
Prof. J.‘ Hammond.‘ Smith, ‘1_1e_'ad ‘or
the‘ department of civil engir.1eering.at

earthedfrom the many volumes of en-
gineering 'students’,_theses, a plan for
a stadium designed by James G.
Decker. and.E_dgar C. Cannon, both
graduates ‘of-‘the school of engineering
in 1909.  . « _

Company at Donora, "Pa.-, and Decker
is a representtative of the Reinforced
‘Concrete Company in the Minneapolis_-
district, * ‘ ‘ ‘ “a
, Capacity 12,000. _

The proposed_stadium was a Grecian

‘cost.;a.pproxin1ately< ‘.-$175,000, and was’
toliave been built at almost the same

I The entrance to the stadium was to
have b”een_ at the in_tersection,of Alle-
quippa and Boquet streets, -and would
have‘ necessitated the discontinuance
of Allequippa street north of the stad-

nect Boquet‘ and Allequippa streets by
a short stree-tin front of the ﬁeld.Th_e
ﬁeld would have been further east than
the __present‘stadium is, a site which
was originally inten_ded'as, a site for a
botanical garden for the university.
The ﬁeld within the stadium would
have been much smallerthan the one

ball field in those. days itself was lon-
ger and wider" than it is today. The
ﬁeld was to ‘have been ‘laid out with
dimensionsof 420-2-O0. feet. The di-_
mensions of the inside of the new sta-
dium are 563x343 feet. The seats were
to be 2 feet and 10 inches deep with a
rise of 18 inches for each tier. There
was not much of a choice of seats in
the sections of the stadium which
were paral-lel, to the lengthof the field,
for there were to be only 15 tiers of
seats. , . I _ T ‘

is designing this, is better ﬁtted
by‘ training and experience to do
this particular work than any
other man living today.
" To sum up brieﬂy, the. Staff of
the, University has determined
that a building of this type pos-
sesses educational advantages
which cannot be obtained in a
low type of structure. There are
no unusual construction problems
which have not been successfully
met’ in other high buildings.
There is unquestionably a great ‘
advantage in favor of the high
building -from the health stand-
,_ point and for sheer architectural
. beauty, this University Cathedral
should exceed anything which has-
ever been constructed by ,- the
hands of man. -
’ Alumni-Will Co-operate‘.

The assembly was an excellent idea
for acqu_ain'tin_g the alumni with the
plans of the University, and certain-
ly brought the graduate body closer
to the administration and to the.stu-
dents. It is hoped that it is only-the
first of a series of similar gatherings
in which the alumni can get'ﬁrst'-
:--hand information on the University’s
plans which will enableithem to lend
a cooperating hand." The alumni re-

‘ . ‘Q ' WHAT 0F_TH-E FUTURE? ‘ . - -

With‘ the stadium now alreiality and there being no'question' about it
being ‘ready for‘foo__tbaII.n'ext faII,- Pittities can being. to conjecture as to just
what it all means to Pitt. , _ _
will be.possibIe for the University to bring even greater football. attractions
to Pittsburgh than ever‘ before. While there will possibly penc radical
changes‘ for ‘a year_or so, as football, schedules are not made in a few days.
there is no doubt that with‘ this stadium as a magnet all thefbest -teams of
the East and Middle_ West will some clay be anxious to play in Pittsburgh.
This has been true of the University of Pennsylvania and other big teams.

The stadium ‘not only ‘means "a -big development in football, but it alsd.
means that Pitt will take -place in the front ranks of the -colleges in base-_
ball’, basket ball-and-track. Track sports especially will be developed as
these are looked on.as on a par with "football in the East. .It was on this
account that the 220-yard straightaway was insisted on in the “design-of the
stadium. Basket ball has also been gaining thousands of. devotees, and with,
Pitt having a pavilion seating 5,000 in connection with the stadium that sport
‘can beidcveloped,’ and the-people who desire to attend the games w‘iIIlhave_
a chance-to get seats. . ~ ' '

. The stadium will also prov
likely that the important college games will be played as twilight contests.
This was _done in several-instances’ at Braddock and proved very convenient
for .the,a‘Iumni. I  p ‘ ' ~ ‘ o  I
 Summing up, Pitt I1as‘accompIis_hed a lot in athletics without any facil-
itlesin the -past. »With these facilities afforded by the stadium, which will
be as good as ,any’coI‘Iege boasts of in the United.States,_ we can be expected
to accomplish evenlgreater results. The alumni have stood by theship in
the~past and.put_ up.wi_th _mai_1y inconveniences. NOW THEY AREGOING TO
HAVE THEIR DA'Y._  _ , ,- ' ._ ’ -_

It is a real relief to the. athletic authorities to bid farewell to Forbest
Field, especially‘ in view of the fact that-thefootball ticket situation ther-"e has
become -intolerable. For the W. & J. and, State, games, many of th‘e.,tickets,
furnished some of the -‘alumni were very unsatisfactory, but there was noth-
ing else to be done. ’Quite a few alumni have written _in'prote's.ting against:

_‘ the seats received, but they should realize that it is impossible for -the-

Ticket Distributing Comm.itte.e_ or anyone else to satisfy‘ everyone at Forbes
Field. With the thousands oﬁticket orders coming in and. only about 4,000
seats" that could be classed as good, it should be plainly evident to everyone
that some alumni will get poor seats, With the stadium available in 1925,.
the game, the ticket
problems will be solvedifor some years to come. _ ' . ' - ~

igiving your 'answe_r;Ei “ In the spring.

1922 the Year commit-tee" invited
Dean Amos to one of its meetings

to- give a resume of co-ed activities.‘
During the meeting she was asked-

how the Alumnae could best help the
undergraduates, and without‘ the
slightest hesitation .she answered, by
the establishment of ha"-student loan

fund, to which she ,, could refer the’-

girls when theyﬂwere .V'ﬂ11anc_ially em-
barassed to a point where it was ab-
solutely impossible. to_ raise ‘funds-

 , , _ ‘ ﬂ -elsewhere. -She advised that there
ide an excellent baseball field, and it is very-

-behno charity, about it,' but that-it be
put on- a, strictly business basis at a
‘low rate of interest.» ‘

The Year Committee realized that
here was an opportunity where the
organized Alumnae could do -some-
‘thing that would count, and that
would proﬁt them in as inuch‘ as it
would so greatly proﬁt others. In
the fall of that year Mary E‘. Aiken,
’19, ‘Chairman, with the - Alumnae-

Year Committee, planned two affairs ,

for the beneﬁt‘. of the Fund, a Rum-
mage Sale . under , the - direction of Jan-
et MacDonald Flinn,-’18,‘which‘ netted
-approxiinately-;$375,‘ and a Card Party
during the holidays under the direc-
tion of Helen Donaldson, ’16,- which
netted approximately $400. During the
fall‘of_ 1923 whenthe Year Commit-
tee was'planning.a.ffa1'rs for the bene-
fit of this Fund,-so much opposition
was voiced -against the Rummage
Sale, because‘ of the, danger to the

health of theidommitee in, charge of

it. and --because of the enormous
amount of work connected _, With'the

- sale, that it was decided not to have

a Rummage Sale, But the Card Party
was kept ‘on the schedule, and under

_.the direction of Margaret‘ Ralston,

Wilson, ’-18, netted about-$375.
When the Loan_Fund was. first con-

templated ‘and when plans‘ were first.

being made for beneﬁts, the {Year

Committee. ‘decided’ unanimously that

no direct ‘appeals for "money ,Would
be made at any time, and that no
appeals would be. made outside .oi
Alumnae and University circles. The
Rummage Sale lived up_to this prin-
ciple. The‘Card Party‘ was distinctly
an indirect“ appeal. Before the -holi-
days of 1922 it ha.d been the custom of

the Alumnae to -have at that time.
each. year a luncheon." The price was
- usuallry $1.50; the attendance about

seventy-ﬁve; ‘the proﬁt, nothing in
