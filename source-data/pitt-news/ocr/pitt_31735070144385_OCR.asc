The Pit

by Mike Gladysz
Sparta Editor

It’s ﬁnally official.
After more than a week of

. consideration, Pitt star tail-

back LeSean McCoy decided
that he will skip his ﬁnal two
seasons of college football eli-
gibility to enter the 2009 NFL
Draft, officially ending Mc-
Coy’s time in college football.
McCoy, his mother and his
older brother met with Pitt
coach Dave Wannstedt Friday
afternoon to talk aboutthe de-

cision. Wannstedt, who spent
16 seasons coaching in the
NFL, told McCoy to take 
time when deciding. McCoy
then told Wannstedt Monday
that he still wasn’t ready to de-
cide. But a statement released
by the school yesterday said

that McCoy + a sophomore _

—- had decided itfwas time to
jump to the pros.

“When you have excep-
tionally gifted players, you re-
alize the NFL can bea reality
sooner rather than later,” said
Wannstedt in the news release.

The Daily Student Newspaper of the

McCoy bolts to N

“Certainly that is the case with
LeSean,' and we worked to
make sure he had all the in-
formation needed to makethe
best decision about his pro
prospects.”

A major part of the deci-,

sion for McCoy was the threat
of an injury, which could hurt
'his Draft stock or threaten
his career in the future. In his
senior year of high school,
McCoy lost recruiting inter-

. est from several schools after

a serious leg injury ended his
season.

     
      
 

“As a result of a season-
ending injury my senior

year, I learned a humbling

lesson,” said McCoy in
the news release. “Noth-
ing is promised to us, and
it can all be taken away in
a moment.”

larly not eligible toienter

Oakland, page I I

An employee at Rue 21, who asked to not be
named because she may not be authorized to com-
ment, said she hasn’t seen much  in the
Forbes Avenue establishment:

“Even with the impact of the economy, it has
beenbusiness as usual.TheonlytimeInoticeda
signiﬁcant decrease in shoppers was over Christmas
break when most of the students went home,” she
said. ‘ ‘Despite the  of the economy, we are
still a major retailer, and our store in Oakland is do
iﬂgwﬁll”

Supervisor Ben McGovern of Oakland’s Five
Guys Burgers and Fries said his business has fared

“With the in the foods we need
[to] purchaseinorderto run ourbusiness,wehave
been forced to monitor our sales more careﬁ.1llylate—
ly,” he said “However, sales atourOaklandlocaiion
havebeenupabout25percenteachwee ”

Roxanne Radrorn, an employee at Oakland Oa-
sis Tanning Salon on Forbes Avenue, said people are
still coming to the salon, but are  pid<ier about
what: services they get; I

‘ ‘Customers are more reluctant to buy 
products andpad<ages thantheywere evenjustlast
semester,” she said “People are deﬁnitely still 
our services, theyjustwanttio purchase the less ex-
pensive  we offer now.’ ’

Pitt students seem to be helping to support Oak-
land as a market  the new year.

\While some students feel that the downturn in
the economy has not  their  hal}
itsina significantway, others are  to

manage their  habits as eﬁicientiy as pos-
sible .

Pitt student Curtis Beisser said he’s  to
cutback .

‘Tm spendingless this year, notgoingoutto eat
as much, not  money on the tickets I’ve
wantedtiothePensgames and onlydoingthingslike
 out to the movies every once in a while,” he
said.

Ron Levid<, the owner of the new IGA food

store on Forbes Avenue, said that the market of col— I

lege students is  them afloat.

"Ihoughwe have onlybeenin business here
for about four months, our location in the center of
a college town is convenient, and we’ve been suc-
cessful despite the hardships of todays economy,”
he said.

Pittsburgh Ballethelps its retiring dancers

by Natalie Bell
Stzzﬁ’ W/rite/'

The Dancer's Trust Benefit
Show

When: Saturday, Jan. 17 at 7:30 p.m.

Where: George White Performance
Center

Cost: $95

_ Retirement at age 30 sounds
likes a dream for most people,
but for ballet dancers, it’s a real-
ity that means starting all over
again.

Dancers at the Pittsburgh
Ballet Theater who were con-
cerned about their retirement
started The Dancer’s Trust Fund
in 1993. Dancers who were with
the Pittsburgh Ballet Theater are
eligible for two $1,500 scholar-
ships to aid in their transition
from dance to other careers. So
far, the organization granted
more than $80,500 to retiring
dancers.

Ballet dancers generally be-
gin training as children and start
their careers in their late teens,
when many people head to col-
lege and just begin to consider
their job choices. However, a
full career for a dancer is a short

one.
“I think retiring for dancers

can be different. Some people 4

are forced to retire much earlier
because of injury and that can
be a shock,” said Christopher
Rendall—]ackson, the logistical
coordinator for the Dancer’s

Trust and a dancer on his way

to receiving the trust, as he ap-
proaches his retirement.

“I’m sure l’ll have a hard
time once I have left because,
like I mentioned, I’ve been do-
ing this since I’ve been 8,” said
Rendall—]ackson, who received
a bachelor’s degree from Pitt
and will move on to Harvard
Law School post-retirement,
where the fund will help pay for
schooling.

He currently hopes to go
into labor law and return to
help with the Dancer’s Trust
and the unionized Pittsburgh
Ballet Theater dancers, though
he admits that he’s keen on see-
ing what kind of law he enjoys
once he gets to law school.

Rendall—]ackson isn’t the
only dancer to take classes at
Pitt. Aaron Ingley, a retired
dancer, enrolled full time at Pitt
this year and is majoring in both

'Slumdog Millionaire’ is well done but a bit hollow

by Andres Miguel
Staﬂ Writer

"SLUMDOG
MILLIONAIRE"

Starring Dev Patel, Freida Pinto
Directed by Danny Boyle

“Slumdog Millionaire,” direc-
tor Danny Boyle’s latest ﬁlm ef-
fort, is a stunning cinematic ex-
ample of a cliche straight out of
politics: the exquisitely delivered
but hollow message.

“Slumdog,” the story
of Indian orphan Ja-
mal Malik (Dev Patel)
and his nearly life—long
romance with fellow
orphan Latika (Freida
Pinto), is unique in its
main storytelling device: a game
of the Indian version of “Who

Wants to Be a Millionaire?” fea-

turingjamal as the challenger. Be-
yond being clever and unconven-
tional, structuring the film around
such a widely recognizable game
show gives viewers the ability to
enter ]amal’s impoverished life

  
  

with ease.

The film begins near
its eventual end.]amal is
a single question away
from the grand prize

when the show suddenly

ends for the night and he
is inconspicuously arrested un-
der suspicion of cheating. During
the interrogation, Jamal reveals
that, despite being an uneducated
slum—dweller (known, of course,
as a “slumdog”) with a menial
job, each question has simply
happened to relate back to a trau-
matic, defining moment in]amal’s

life that gave him the knowledge
to answer correctly.

The ﬂashbacks to these mo-
ments make up the bulk of the
ﬁlm, revealing ]amal’s tragic past
and eventually the current situ-
ation — that he only went on the
show to deliver a message to Lati-
ka, who he cannot find, and that
he never intended to win money.
It simply seemed fated that he
would succeed.

Unfortunately, that phrase —
and the idea of fate as a control-
ling power, in general — quickly
becomes the main theme of the

Elm and divorces all the charac-
ters from any agency they might
have had. The deus ex machina
in this film is overwhelming and
distracting, from the fated “Mil-
lionaire”‘questions to the myriad
coincidences in]amal’s life leading
to Latika’s frequent appearances
and disappearances.

Fortunately, the superﬁcial
aspects of “Slumdog” are beau-
tifully crafted. The imagery and
atmosphere are a combination
of an exuberant Bollywoodcolor
palette with the grainy, realist cin-
ematography of a gritty drama.

JUSTIN IT FOR THE MUSIC

Rock and Roll Hall of

Fame misses the mark

   

by Justin S Jacobs
/le9’E Editor 4

After years of awful Grammywinners,
talentless pop stars gracing the cover of
Rolling Stone and unoriginal rock band
hacks‘-bieing touted by record labels as the
next big thing, it’s no surprise that any self-
respectingmusic fan would be quite wary
of, shall we say, the corporate rock ’n’ roll
machine.

The Rock And Roll Hall of Fame,
though, always seemed to me to be so self-
aware that its kitsch factor overshadowed
its corporate undertones,‘ still maintaining
some form of clever credibility.

Until yesterday. .

For yesterday is when the judges at the

S Hall of Fame announced their inductees of

2009, taken from a larger list of nominees.
It’s a pretty solid list, too, unul you notice
which nominee was left in the dust. The in-
ductees include Metallica, Run D.M.C., Jeff
Beck, Little Anthony and the Imperials and
Bobby Womack. Left off that list, crimi-
nally, is The Stooges, a band responsible for
inﬂuencing the creation of i this little genre
we like to call, ahem, punk rock

(Pause in  for readers to huff and
puff in disgust for several minutes, calm
down by listening to something loud and
agitated, then realize that said band was un-
doubtedly inﬂuenced by The Stooges, start
fuming again, punch the nearest inanimate
object, then calm down. Estimated time:
seven minutes).

The actual Hall of Fame building, as
opposed to the institution, is a giant glass
pyramid overlooking Lake Erie right in the
heart of downtown Cleveland. It houses a
handful of theaters showing ﬂicks about
the magic of rock music and the badass—
ness of bands like The Who.

The whole establishment hallows the
forefathers of rock music with shrines and
exhibits where the actual edge of rock ’n’
roll is softened, archived and presented in
glass cases. Is it lame? Of course, but it’s en-
dearing as well.

The Hall of Fame is a lot like your soft-
spoken uncle who used to drop a whole lot
of _ acid and then roll around in the snow
naked in the ’60s, but now just sits at family
picnics eating potato salad and referencing
his youth with phrases like, ‘‘\Well, back then

things were different” and “Oh, we were
kids then.”

In other words, The-Hall of Fame gives
you a glimpse of the wild world of rock but
‘iscareful to watch its manners.

But still, for an institution that proposes
to honor the golden age of rock ’n’ roll, the
bands that really made an impact on the
world of music, it sure as hell missed the
mark. Are other bands more popular than
The Stooges? Yes.

In fact, most bands are more popu-
lar than The Stooges. Seriously, name
one. There’s a good chance that the band
you just named is more popular than-The
Stooges. But there’s almost no chance that
it was more inﬂuential.

\X/ith front man Iggy Pop’s rattlesnake
holler and penchant for bloodying himself
onstage, Ron Ashton’s rough and skin-tear-
ing  lines (Note: Ashton died in his
home just last week and should "be rolling
in his grave right now) and Scott Ashton’s
jackhammer drumming, The Stooges cre-
ated raw and  punk rock nearly a de-
cade before so many bands used the then

it-genre to rise to fame.

In the summer of love, The Stooges
were preaching destruction with  dis- ,
tortion and spastic rock freak-outs.

What’s worse, some of the first wave
punk bands that The Stooges inﬂuenced
have already been inducted, some years ago,
tothe Hall of Fame. The Clash? 2003. The
Ramones and Talking Heads? 2002. Even
the more-hype-than-talent Sex Pistols made
it in 2006.

What’s worse is that The Stooges was
among the nominees, meaning it was will-
fully passed up.

The Hall of Fame had therchance to
actually live up to its potential -— that
is, to honor the creators and shapers of
rock while balancing credibility and family
friendliness — and the out-of-touch judges
blew it.

Maybe next year the Hall of Fame judg-
es will take their collective head out of their
collective ass, park the minivan and throw
the James Taylor (who was inducted in
2000) CD out the window, then listen to a
Stooges jam and realize what complete rock
’n’ roll madness they’ve been missing.

'Slumdog lVlillionaire' mirrors Bollywood movies

Slumdog, page 7

The acting is superb from all of ]amal’s
and Latika’s incarnations over their history,
and the music is appropriate and well—used.
Even the telling of the story is fantastic —
the present-moment frame story surround-
ing ]amal’s past never incites confusion,

and the pacing is restrained and effective
despite the copious use of ﬂashbacks.
However, Boyle (director of “28 Days
Later” and “Trainspotting”) seems to lose
his thematic thrust in the telling of such an
uplifting and sentimental story. While the

glimpses into the poverty of modern-day
India are certainly affecting, the film never
rises above just being a retelling of events,
chieﬂy because of the strong influence
of “fate.” There seems to be an irnplica—
tion throughout the ﬁlm that Jamal some-

Latika simply because he suffered so much

be the only reason why the film resolves
the way it does. It is especially uncharac-

basic themes in light of the complexity of
his previous works — the terrifying look at
the monstrosity of humanity in “28 Days
Later” being one example among many. It
is unusual — and slightly insulting — that a
ﬁlm so exquisitely crafted in other respects
has such a basic message at its core. Unfor-
tunately, this simplicity actually takes away
from the effect of the ﬁlm, leaving too
many unexplained coincidences and unan-
swered questions to allow the acceptance

of the miracle of fate that it attempts to
enshrine.

This is, of course, not an invalidation
of “Slumdog” as a whole. The ﬁlm has a
number of redeeming aspects and is, to be
fair, a very engaging and entertaining expe-
rience. However, it ultimately mirrors the
resplendent Bollywood—style musical num-
ber that accompanies the post-ﬁlrn credits
— gorgeous, exhilarating and almost fasci-
natingly empty.

ﬁnance and history.

Ingley took classes at Pitt while he was
still a professional dancer. In order to bal-
ance a full—time dance career and classes,
he took one or two classes a semester.

That said, he beats out any super-
seniors. “It only took me nine years, but
I’m ﬁnally a junior,” he jokes.

He’ll ﬁnish his degree in a compara-
tively speedy two-and—a—half years.

“It sort of feels good to be moving
on, I’ve accomplished this one dream,
and now I have this freedom to sort of
ﬁgure out what the next big dream chase
will be. This is one of those transition
times in life and one of those great op-
portunities where you can sort of do any-
thing you want,” said Ingley.

Ingley’s not exactly sure where he’s
going yet in his career, but he has a few
years to ﬁgure it out.

Of the Dancer’s Trust Ingley said,
“They had a great idea back then and
have successfullyevolved it into a worth-
while and really well functioning fund,
and they’ve managed to give out a lot
of scholarships to a lot of really well-
deserving people.”

This Saturday at Point Park Universi-
ty’s George White Performance Theater,
the Dancer’s Trust Fund will hold a show
as a fundraiser for the organization.

Dancers are able to choose their own
piece and partner, and so the dances are
all different.

prep school before enrolling at Pitt, mak-
ing him three years removed from high
school and therefore NFL Draft—eligibile.

Former Pitt receiver Larry Fitzger-
ald, now of the Arizona Cardinals, also
left Pitt following his sophomore year.
Fitzgerald was the third overall pick in the
2004 Draft.

McCoy said several times in the ﬁ-
nal weeks of the regular season that he
planned to return for his junior year, but
his plans changed after Pitt’s 3-0 loss in
the Sun Bowl Dec. 31 — Pitt’s ﬁrst bowl
appearance since 2004.

The last Pitt player to declare early was
Darrelle Revis in 2007.

Revis, a junior at the time he declared,
was the 14th player chosen in the,Draft
and currently plays with the New York
Jets. ~

McCoy rushed for 2,816 yards and 35
touchdowns in two seasons with Pitt —

Bgs leads the Wa f undefeated Pitt

South Florida’s basketball team arrived late
to the Petersen Events Center last night be-
cause of the poor weather conditions. Tyrell
Biggs made the Bulls pay for their tardiness.

The senior forward scored seven of Pitt’s
ﬁrst 12 points on his way to a season—high 16
as the Panthers prevailed against tougher-than-
expected South Florida 75-62. ,

Biggs started the scoring with a layup off an
offensive rebound and took off from there.

“I felt like the rebound and layup I had just ‘

got me going at ﬁrst,” said Biggs. “There were
a couple easy buckets after that. It was just
ﬂowing tonight’_’

“He knocked down shots early,” said Pitt
coach Jamie Dixon. “He was around the bas-
ket, he’s ﬁnishing around the rim so much bet-
ter. He’s given us, I want to say solid play, but
that’s almost underestimating what he’s done
for us.” i

The start of the game was delayed about 20
minutes, as the Bulls didn’t even make it onto

the court to warm up for the first time until _

6:45 p.m., 15 minutes before the intended tip-
off. ‘

The delay di "t seem to affect the Pan-
thers offensively, as they went 10—of—18 from
3-point range. But South Florida also shot well
and gave Pitt all it could handle. \X/ith just more

bounce back in second half

by Adam Littman
Senior Staﬂ Writer

For the ﬁfth “straight game, the Pitt
men’s basketball team didn’t reallyshow up
until the second half.

The South Florida Bulls (6-10, 1-3 Big
East) held their own at the Petersen Events
Center, trailing the No. 1 Panthers by only
four points at the half. The two were even
tied at 30 with just less than four tninutes
to go.

\While the Panthers (16—O, 4-0 Big East)

-shot ‘an impressive 50 percent from the

ﬁeld in the ﬁrst half, the Bulls were even
better, connecting on 57 percent of their

shots. .—.

“Our defense was a little sluggish,” said
Pitt center Dejuan Blair.

The Bulls also hit 8—of—9 free throws in
the ﬁrst half, while the Panthers only made
4-of—9 and shot 63 percent from 3-point
range.

For the Panthers, it was the continuance
of a could—be dangerous trend.

In its last ﬁve games, Pitt’s biggest lead
at the half has been ﬁve, which was against
St. Johns. In all ﬁve of those games, the

Panthers at least doubled the point differ-"

ential between them and their opponent by
the ﬁnal whistle. ‘ "

Get ready for Primanti s, Philly fans

   

by Pat Mitsch .
Senior Staﬁ’ Wrzler

Before we get to  else, let’s settle
this:

—- Regarding the revolving doors on the
ﬁrst—ﬂoor patio of the Cathedral: 'Ihere’s no
right or wrong entrance or exit. Nothing says
you have to line up and wait to walk in on the
right side while others exit on the left; It’s a
revolving door. That’s the point of a revolv-
ing door. You can go in or out on the same
side-. Please use them both so I can get on
with my life.

— I also don’t get why people slow down
and cause long traffic jams when they enter
the Squirrel Hill Tunnel from the other side.

« .. And it’s only this tunnel. There are plenty of

tunnels on the turnpike and none of them are
treated nearly as gingerly as the Squirrel Hill
Tunnel. If a helicopter can fly into the tunnel
under the English Channel in "Mission Im-
possible,” crash, explode and Tom _Cruise still
comes out immaculate, then the Squirrel Hill
Tunnel isn’t that treacherous.

—— All this knowledge coming from the
guy who showed up to class an hour early on
Tuesday and wondered where everybody was.

The real after-the-fact, wow—am—I—an—idiot
moment of this was when I saw _a kid who
is in my class head off to another classroom
and thought, “Hmm. Wonder where that

guY’S going?”
Phew. OK, sports?

of ‘the Day: “Who’s the captain of our crew?
Who’s a friend to me and you? Kinda nice,
good looking, too?”

— All I wanted to do on Monday morning
after a brisk 11 a.m. wake—up was watch the
Steelers highlights and hear Mernl Hodge re-
hash every play as if it were designed by God

as an example of how football was meant to

be played. I waited more than an hour for
that while ESPN put everyone in the NFL
and everyone who covers the NFL on the air
using satellite or video phone or whatever to
talk about their one run—in with Tony Dungy
eight years ago and how sincere he sounded
when he said, “Excuse me,” as he brushed by.
A great coach, though, Dungy.

A g—— A Steelers—Cardinals Super Bowl would
be like Pittsburgh vs. Pittsburgh. Or, rather,
Pittsburgh vs. Everyone Who Once Coached

Get The Head-Coaching job When Cow-
her Retired So They Had To Leave For Ari-
zona And Ride Larry Fitz’ Coattails. A great
job they/re doing in the desert, though, Russ
Grimm and Ken Whisenhunt .

— But what if the planets align and the

. Steelers and Eagles wind up in the Super

Bowl? I’ll tell you what I would like to see:
the Pittsburgh and Philadelphia mayors make

- a bet on the game unlike any mayors’ bet ever

seen before in history. The losing city (are you
ready for this?)  the losing city would for one
year be forced to produce only the other citfs
marquis sandwich. Yes. Imagine, you “Philly”
and “just outside of Philly” people, coming
home over the summer, longing for a taste
of your native Just-.Outside-of-Philadelphia,
traveling to Pat’s or Gino’s (if you’re “that”
guy), ordering your beloved Wiz—without and
getting ... a Primanti Bros. No.. 2 Bestseller
sandwich with a greasy, uncapped bottle of-
Red Devil hot sauce and an I.C. Light. Haba-
haha. Hahahahahahaha!

Bulls. Pitt faces Louisville on the road this Saturday.

than 16 minutes remaining, the Bulls trailed by
just three. That’s when Pitt pulled away.

“They’re awfully good,” said South Florida
coach Stan Heath. “They taught us a lesson on
the glass and how to get it.”

Pitt outrebounded its counterpart 37-23.

DeJuan Blair and Levance Fields each
notched double-doubles for No. 1 Pitt (16-0,
4-0 Big East).

Blair ﬁnished with 13 points and 18 re-
bounds,‘ while Fields added 11 points and a
career-high 13 assists to only one turnover.

“Fields is just such a floor general out
there,” said Heath. “The way he runs the team
and doesn’t make a mistake ﬁs impressive] .”

Dixon agreed.

“Just great decisions all the way through,”
said Dixon. 1

Sam Young contributed 14 points and went
3—of—6 from outside.

Dominique Jones and Augustus Gilchrist
totaled 22 points for South Florida (6-10, 1-3
Big East). Junior Chris Howard, who attended
the same high school as Young, chipped in 13
points. But the rest of the Bulls combined for
only ﬁve points.

Pitt’s defense limited South Florida senior

Jesus Verdejo to only two points on 0-of—7
shooting.

The Panthers shot out to a 10-2 advantage,
culminated by e 3-pointer from Biggs. Biggs
ﬁnished going 7 for 10 from the ﬁeld.

South Florida struck back behind some
effective jump shooting. Jones and Gilchrist
connected on 3-pointers during an 8-0 run to
tie the game 18-18.

Just as quickly, Pitt scored seven straight
But the pesky Bulls refused to be intimidated
by the No. 1 team in the country. A 7-0 run of
their own knotted the score at 30 with 4:41 left
in the half.

Three-pointers on two straight posses-
sions, including one by Fields. as the shot clock
expired, pushed the Panthers to a 41-37 half-
time advantage. 3 ‘_

South Florida drained niore tough shots
to start the half, but an 8—0irun capped by 21
Brad Wanamaker 3—pointer':gave Pitt its ﬁrst
double-digit advantage of the night, and Pitt
led 55.44. -  ’

Howard hit a 3-pointer of his own to pull
the Bulls within nine at 62-53, but an ensuing
11-4 Pitt run ensured that the Panthers would
remain unbeaten.

Dixon moves up on wins list

Notebook, page 11

In all but one of those games, Pitt in-
creased its ﬁeld goal shooting percentage in
the second half, while holding its opponent
to either the same or a lower point total.

. But with games against Louisville, Syra-
cuse and West Virginia next on the sched-
ule, the Panthers can’t just expect to dangle
the possibility of an upset over another
team’s head for an entire half. Eventually,
someone is going to grab it. Plus, being the
top-ranked team in the nationialready has
teams pumped up to play Pitt.

Dixon moves up on all-time wins
list '

With the victory last night, Pitt coach
Jamie Dixon moved in sole—possession of
third place on Pitt’s all-time wins list. Dixon
is 148-40 in his ﬁve—plus years as Panthers
head coach.

Last night he passed Paul Evans (1986-
1994). Next up for Dixon is Robert Tim-
mons (1953-1968), who was 174-189 at his
time coaching the Panthers. The top spot is
a bit further away. Dr. H.C. Carlson (1922-
1953) is the all-time wins leader at Pitt, go
ing 367-247 during his tenure. A

Career-high for Fields

Levance Fields already leads the Big
East in assists with an average of 6.7 per
game. After last night, that number is go-
ing to go up.

Fields recorded a career—high 13 assists,
while only turning over the ball once.

i“Guys_ were hitting their shots, and as
a result, I was able to get all those assists,”
said Fields. .

He also tossed in 11 points, shooting
3-of-6 from beyond the arc. Fields im-
pressed not only Dixon, who said Fields
made “great decisions all the way through,”
but South Florida coach Stan Heath also
talked highlyiof the senior point guard.

“Fields is such a court general out
there,” said Heath. “I don’t think he made
a mistake out there all night.” ’

Game Delayed Because of Weather

Last night Pitt took part in the incred-
ibly rare basketball game delayed because
of the weather. The game‘ was delayed
roughly 20 minutes because the Bulls, as
well as the referees, couldn’t get to the Pete
on time in the snow-clogged ttafﬁc; While
the Bulls had difficulty getting to the arena,
Pitt fans made it out in droves.

“The most amazing thing of the day is

that we had that many people at this, game 7

tonight, considering the traffic,” said Dix-
on. “It conﬁnues to amaze me.”
