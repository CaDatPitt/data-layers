STUDENT GOVERNMENT

Board

implements fund

to aid in housing

emergencies   »

~   Abbey Reighard
Sta_[fdWriter h

After weeks of planning and reviewing, the
Student Government Board has ensured that
students facing crises will have support .

Since last Tuesday, the Board made Jung-
es to the Crisis Relief Fund bill, which will
create a ﬁnancial resource for students who
experience housing crises.

Board members voted on the pilot pro-
gram last night attheirweekly 8:45 p.m. meet-
ing in front of about 12 students gathered in
Nordy’s Place of the William Pitt Union. The
Board introduced the fund at its weeldy meet-

ing two weeks ago,‘but postponed an ofﬁcial .

vote on the bill in order to make changes.
Much of the bill for the Crisis Relief Fund
remained thesame since‘ its introduction two

weeks ago. The fund will still be comprised of '

$2,000 reserved from the SGB budget, and if
unused,willroll back into the StudentActivity
Fund at the end of the ﬁscal year. Individual
students who have experienced a housing
crisis can receive up to $250. A

Board member Graeme Meyer, who also
serves as the Wellness Committee liaison,
initially proposed that the Board distribute
the fund through an application process. The

Reba Sikder heard a loud boom at work one
momingasthe building collapsed around her.
Sikder doesn’t know how long she remained
unconscious, but woke up to ﬁnd her feet
trapped under a machine.

When she regained consciousness, she

heard a nearby co-worker who was trapped ~

under a beam. Bleeding, he begged her for

help.

“I told him, ‘Brotherl can’t help you, I am
stuck too,”.’ Sikder said. “A few minutes later
he died.” ‘

Although Sikder eventually managed to
free herselfand was later rescued by the Ban-
gladeshi army, the co-worker Sikder heard
dying was one of more than 1,100 garment
workers killed when the Rana Plaza building
—— located in a suburb of Dhaka, Bangladesh’s

. capital city — collapsed last April.

    

Sikder spoke Tuesday night alongside Kal-
pona Akter, executive director of the Bangla-
desh Center for Worker Solidarity, also from
Bangladesh. Two Pitt student groups, Amer-
icans for Informed Democracy and South
Asian Student Association, hosted the event.

' Sikder, who now suffers from post-uaumatic
stress disorder, was crying by the time she
ﬁnished relaying her experiences.

Board has since decided that it will instead
contact students who the University reports
were affected by housing crises rather than
use an application process.

“We made itaprocess where we reach out
to students to make sure that we can help them
as soon as possible,” Meyer said.

WORKERS’

Akter discussed the problems in Bangla-
desh, where workers live on some of the lowest
wages in the world and often face intimida-
tion, violence or risk oflosingtheir jobs ifthey
attempt to unionize. _

Although the naﬁonal activist organiza-
tion United Students Against Sweatshops
organized the tour that included the two
Bangladeshi .women’s visit to Pitt’s campus,
the visitwas well—timed for some members of

AID and the No Sweat Coalition, a broad alli-
ance of campus groups that advocate for the
rights of workers who make Pitt apparel. The
groups used the event to encourage students
and community members to support one of
their ongoing initiatives.

Since last semester, -these groups have
pushed for Pitt to join a growing list of uni-
versities that require their apparel licensees
to sign the Accord on Fire and Building Safety
in Bangladesh, a measure University officials
say they are currently considering.

Joe Thomas,an organizer forAID, said that
more than 160 students and faculty members

signed the petitions that members ‘of the No q

Sweat Coalition distributed after Sikder and

Akter spoke. The petitions urged Pitt ofﬁcials

to adopt the accord.
According to the Bangladesh Accord

Foundation, a group founded to administer _

the agreement, the accord is a legally bind-

_ ing agreement between international labor

unions, labor groups within Bangladesh and
more than 150 of the apparel companies and
brands that buy clothes from suppliers located
there. i
Labor activists say the accord, which labor
groups drafted in May 2013 after the disaster
at Rana Plaza, will better protect Bangladeshi
workers. . S
In addition to multiple ‘garment facto-
ries,.the eight—story building also housed the
branch of a bank and several shops, but em-
ployees of these businesses were not working
because of the perceived danger, accordingto
media reports. ,
Sikder, 19, said that on the day the building
collapsed, managers at the factories in the
building threatened workers that they would
lose their j obs if they refused to retum to work.
Akter pointed outthat the Rana Plazawas
so horriﬁc, it largely eclipsed the memory of
a ﬁre that killed more than 100 workers at
the Tazreen Fashions factory, also located in
Dhaka, in November 2012. The ﬁre exit inthe
factory was locked and the ﬁre extinguishers
did not work, according to media reports.
Provisions of the agreement address such
oversights — which garment factory owners
and managers often encourage to cut operat-

ing costs — by requiring apparel companies _

that sign it to conduct safety inspections of
their suppliers located in Bangladesh. Ifcloth-
ing suppliers must close afactory for mainte-
nance, the companies that buy clothingfrom
the factory must continue to pay workers in
the meantime. ‘

The accord also calls for the creation of
a committee including representatives from
garment companies and labor organizations.
The committee would be responsible for ap-
pointing an independent chief of safety in-
spections who could only be ﬁred in the event
of serious misconduct, and this ofﬁcial would
be responsible for making sure brands follow

“The accord has very speciﬁc ,mecha— .

nisms to make sure corporations pay their
fair share,” Thomas, aseniormajoringinbiol-
ogy and political science, said.

The agreement also requires companies
that sign the agreement to continue tobuy
clothing from the same factories they used
before signing. For at least two years after
signing the agreement, companies must buy

asmuch or more apparel at each factory they.

use in Bangladesh as they did the year before
signing the agreement.

Thomas and other members of AID and the
No Sweat Coalition began to meet frequently
last semester with Lori Burens, Pit_t’s direc-
tor of licensing, after Pitt joined the Worker
Rights Consortium, a monitoring group for
the rights of workers who make university
apparel, inAugust. '—

At the meetings, which Thomas said took
place everyweek ortvvo weeks, Burens and the

other students discussed ways to ensure the

safety ofworkers who make Pitt’s licensed ap-
parel. The Accord on Building and Fire Safety
in Bangladesh came up in these meetings.

Thomas and Burens have their first meet— -

ing this semester scheduled for Friday.

Aside from the meetings, Thomas and
other members of the No' Sweat Coalition
have made sugar—coated appeals directly to
Chancellor Mark Nordenberg. y

University ofﬁcials have yet to make aﬁnal
decision. '

“The University is reviewing the Bangla-
desh Accord andwillnotifythe students when
a decision has been made,”- Burens said in
an email. - A i

If Pitt does follow the students’ requests,
it  join at least six other universities that

have made signing the accord a requirement

for their licensees.

Duke University announced such a move in
a public statement last October that reported
its licensees would have to sign the accord.

A The University of Pennsylvania, Temple
University and New York University’ an-
nounced in December that they, too, would
require licensees to sign the accord. '

' Pennsylvania State University, Georgetown
University and Cornell University issued simi-
lar statements earlier this month.

In November,2001,- Goldman

released a report in which he
coined the term “BRIC,i’g refer-

ring to the countries Brazil,

Russia, India and China. O’Neill
predicted that these emerging
markets would drive global
economic growth over the next
decade.. l ' ”

‘And he was right —-— for a

tunately, strong growth in the

global commodity and credit
boom, which had started at the
‘beginning of the decade, ended
in 2008. ° t V

-By August 2013, 0’Neill felt '

that to retain its original signiﬁé
cance, the acronym should be
shortened to “C.” However, at
that point in time, economists
were shifting their focus to a dif-
ferent group of countries with a
new catchy mnemonic. T f

A I _On Aug. 5, an analyst at Mor-
gan Stanley released a report
on the “Fragile Five” —— Brazil,

India, Indonesia, South Africa
and Turkey. These countriesall
have large government and trade
deﬁcits, aswell as low growth,
higher inﬂation and rumblings

of political instability.

_ . Recently, there » _has been-
concern about the ability of
the Fragile Five tomaintain the
capital inﬂows that have allowed
them to run thesedeﬁcits. This
has‘ led tovolatility inthe valu-
ation of their currencies. For
example, the Turkish lira fell 13
percent against the dollar over
the past month.

e Federal Reserve’s mandate: a global perspective

This has prompted interest 1

rate increases of varying degrees
by Turkey, South Africa and In-
donesia in an attempt to both

_ prevent destabiliz ing devalua-
tions of their currencies as well

as to reign in inﬂation.

In the midst of this, there
have been complaints that the
recent decision by the Federal
Reserve to cut back on bond pur-
chases has negatively impacted
emerging market countries, in
particular, the Fragile Five.

As "the Fed aggressively cut
interest rates in the face of the

recession in 2008, yields on U.S.
bonds fell dramatically, which
led to increased investment in
emerging markets as investors
searched for higher yields else-
where. It was this shift that has
allowed the Fragile Five to run
large ﬁscal deﬁcits, inrmuch
the same fashion as the United
States. A
However, as the Fed proceeds
with its plan to slow bond pur-
chases, rising yields on U.S. debt
will draw back investors. The

governor of Brazil’s central bank likened
the Fed’s actions to turning on a “vacuum
cleaner” that would suck investment out
of emerging markets and put them into
the United States.

Such a shift would make it much
harder for the Fragile Five to run stable
deﬁcits. They would have to raise inter-
est rates —— as they have started to do
already -— to continue to attract investors
in order to service their debt.

Currently, it seems like the Fed will
remain steadfast in its cutbacks, even in
the face of ]anuary’s dismal unemploy-
ment numbers. Nonetheless, the Fed

should take into consideration more .

than simply the domestic consequences
of its tapering program. Not only will it
have a negative impact on the Fragile Five
and other emerging market countries, it
will have a negative impact on the United
States as well.

Technically speaking, it is not the
responsibility of the Federal Reserve to

consider the broader international im-
pact of its actions. The Reserve’s stated
objectives are to achieve “maximum em-
ployment, stable prices and moderate
long-term interest rates,” which is con-
sistent with its mandate as an institution.
Note that none of these objectives include
international economic stability.
However, it is obvious that the Federal
Reserve has a vested interest in maintain-

impact on the ﬁnancial situation of for-
eign nations.

Amidst the recent turmoil, some have
argued that despite the concerns of in-
vestors, the economic fundamentals of
the Fragile Five are sound and no crises
are imminent. This might be true, but
sound fundamentals cannot fully insulate
a country from the possibility of large
outﬂows of short-term debt for two rea-

investors extrapolatea weakness in one
economy to regional problems.

This is why we’ve experienced the
Latin American Financial Crisis in the
1980s and the Asian Financial Crisis in
the 1990s rather than the Brazilian and
Thai crises. Now that these ﬁve countries
have been grouped together as fragile, it
is very possible that instability in any one
of them could cause a general ﬂight of
investors. Market sentiment plays a huge
role in the occurrence of ﬁscal troubles.

Finally, even if the Fed lacks any
concern for the international ﬁnancial
system, it still should worry about the
eventual ﬁscal impact a possible debt
crisis would have on the United States.
Historically, if a country ison the brink
of default, it has been because U.S. banks

has funded the IMF rescue packages.
As U.S. banks are increasingly. exposed

prescient. So perhaps the Fed should re-
consider their stance, in the interest of

ACC £’:REAl(5U=0Wi"4

Ryan Bertonaschi
Staff Writer

Two miracle plays at the buzzer highlighted
the past week of ACC basketball. Inboth plays,
coaches called questionable timeouts at ques-
tionable times, which might have led to losses
for their respective teams.

Wednesday, Pitt head coachjamie Dixon
and the Panthers held a one-p_oint edge and
were set to defend a ﬁill-court play with 4.4
seconds left against No. 1 Syracuse. Dixon
called timeout following a pair of successful
free throws by center Talib Zarma to make
substitutions and toensure his team defended
the way he wanted.

Syracuse inbounded underneath Pitt’s

’ basket. Point guard Tyler Ennis, Syracuse’s

second option coming out of the timeout,
gathered the pass and took four dribbles
before sinking a 35-foot running jump shot
to Win. I 7 _ ; . . ,
Ennis told Syracuse reportersthat Dixon’s

timeout helped the undefeated Orange.

SPORTS  

Buzzer beaters build leaguewide buzz, keep Orange on top

“We kind of got to see what we have op-
tions—wise,” Ennis said.

Syracuse coachjim Boeheim agreed.

“That helped us because it gave us achance
to set up a second option,” Boeheim said.

The following night, Boston College head
coach Steve Donahue and his team found
themselves in a similar situation on the road
against Georgia Tech.

Boston College guard Olivier Hanlan hit a
jump shot with 3.4 seconds left, which puthis
Eagles up 71-70. Like Dixon, Donahue elected
a timeout after the basket.

When play resumed, Georgia Tech’s Mar-
cus—Georges Hunt received an inbound pass,
dribbled three times, hit a27—footjumperwith
0.1 seconds left and was fouled while~releas-
ing the shot, so the Yellowjackets ended up
winning 74-71.

“Our ﬁnal playwe did draw up at the time-
out,” Georgia Tech head coach Brian Gregory
told reporters after the game. “Simply because
it is a play that we run, but we just changed
up the spots.”

Both Syracuse and Georgia Tech were out
of timeouts when their counterparts called a
timeout. Regardless of whether the opposing
coaches truly gave a gift by stopping play, fans
of ACC teams have been treated with athrilling

. conference season so far.

Here are The Pitt News’ updated ACC
power rankings. ’ '

Syracuse (25-o, 12-o ACC)

Half of the Orange’s conference games
have been decided by afew late possessions,
but Syracuse fans haven’t had reason to doubt
their No. 1 Orange. Theirteam has asure—shot
weapon for pulling out late—game victories in
Ennis. In the ﬁnal ﬁve minutes of regulation
in one-possession games and in overtime
this season, Ennis has gone 14-of-14 from the

free-throw line and 8—of-9 ﬁ'om the ﬁeld while ‘

recording six assists and no turnovers. And,
on potential game-tying or go-ahead situa-
tions, he is 4—of—4 from the ﬁeld and 8-of—8
from the free-throw line.

The Orange will reportedly sport throw-
back uniforms when they face Boston College

tonight, a contest against one of the ACC’s
basement—dwellers before one of this season’s
biggest showdowns at Duke on Saturday.

Virginia (21-5, 12-1 ACC)

If our rankings were solely based of con-
ference play, the Cavaliers would be in ﬁrst
place. Virginia owns the No. 1 scoring defense
inthe country— allowingjust 55.6 points per
game -— and has yet to give up 70 points to
an ACC opponent. The Cavs continue what is
arguably the easiest ACC schedule when they
host Notre Dame Saturday.

Duke (20-5, 9-3 ACC)

Last Saturday, it took a missedjump hook
with 0.1 seconds left for Duke to hold on and
beat longtime-ACC foe Maryland, 69-67,
in the ﬁnal scheduled meeting between the
teams. The Blue Devils were unable to travel
to play rival North Carolina last Wednesday
because of inclement weather, and the game
has been rescheduled for tomorrow.

_ Head coach Roy Williams picked up his
300th career win by topping Florida State,
81-75, Monday. The surging Tar Heels con-
tinue their four~games-in—eight— days stretch
when they host Duke on Thursday at 9 p.m.
and Wake Forest on Saturday. ‘

Pitt (2o—6, 8-5 ACC) '

After losing at home to Syracuse and on the
road against North Carolina, the Panthers are

out of regular-season opportunities to collect A

a signature win. They have now lost six games
to’ ﬁve teams (Syracuse twice) in statistician
Ken Pomeroy’s poll of top 25 teams, and if
the regular season ended today, Pitt would
not receive a second round-bye in the ACC

Conference Tournament. 6
Yet history suggests that the Panthers are
better of playing earlier in the week of their

_ conference tournament. Pitt is 0-4 in its past

fourexperiences receiving double buys in the
Big East Tournament. 1 9

.T—6 North Carolina State (169, 6-6 ACC) .

and‘c1emson(15—9, 6-6 ACC)

According to ESPN’s NCAA Tournament
projections, Pitt is the last ACC team thatfwill
receive abid, so it’s up to the Wolfpack and the
Tigers to determine a potential sixth. Clem-
son has lost three straight and no longer has
its projected at-large berth. North Carolina
State was 14.9 seconds from knocking off

unbeaten Syracuse on Saturday, but instead, 1

the Wolfpack turned the ball over, and the

ACC9.

-in his 22nd year. .“I’m conﬁdent our plan will
be successful.” S ' _ _  ‘ .
The Panthers placed third overall lastyear

at the Big Eayst_-championships, but they expect a

to face stiffer'_competition in Greensboro.

-As a who_l_e,the team has put together a .,

commendable season’. The relay teams have

"been moderately successful, rankingﬁfth in

the ACC in the 400-meter medley and eighth

‘ in the 200-, 400- and 800—meter freestyle,

as well as eighth in the 200-meter medley.
But a select few swimmers and divers in par-
ticular have been key factors in the team’s
strong in—season performance heading into
the postseason. .

Kaleigh Ritter: The sophomore from

Houston is ranked 18th in the nation in the
A _ 1,650-meter freestyle and third inthe ACC.
, While that eventwill be her best shot at plac-

ing, Ritter also ranks 10th inthe conference
in the 500-meter freestyle and 14th in the
1,0o0—meter freestyle. She already holds
two school records in the :i,000-meter and
1,650-meterfreestyles, so asuccessful perfor-
manceinGreensborowi]lonly ﬁirtherbolster

6‘ her conﬁdence moving forward.

Veronica Lee: A senior fromToronto, Lee

S will head into the ACC championships as the '
. most experienced Panther on the roster. She
1 will appear in her fourth conference champi-

onship meet — the previous three were Big
East championships —- and contributed to

H the school record—setting 200—meter med-

ley relay at last year’s championships. She

currently ranks sixth in. the conference in

the 200—meter breaststroke and 14th in the
20o—meter individual medley. The senior
will look to addqa few more accolades to her
career at Pitt, when she competes in her last
collegiate conference championship.

l{achelSaunders:Alreadythemostskilled ‘

diver on the team, Saunders, afreshman from
Warrington, Pa., will lookto shine‘in her ﬁrst
collegiate postseason appearance. Saunders
has been the Panthers’ best diver inthe 1—me-
ter, 3-meter and theplatform, posting the
team’s top season scores for all three events.

Dani des Tombe: Like fellow Canadian

teammate Lee, des Tombe is one of Pitt’s top ' I

returning swimmers. Des Tombe, of Burl-
ington, Ontario, was a member of the school
record—setting 800—meter freestyle relay and
200-meter medley relay at last year’s Big East
championships. She has posted the best times
for the Panthers this year in 100-meter and
200—meter freestyle.

Kinga Cichowska: A long way from home,
the freshman from Wroclaw, Poland, has al-
ready made a name for herselfat Pitt. Current-
ly ranked ﬁfth in the ACC for the 200-meter
breaststroke and seventh for the 100-meter
breaststroke, Cichowska has a chance to make
some noise in herﬁrstpostseason. Cichowska,

aformer two-time gold medalist in the junior .

Olympics, has already set school records in
both the 100-meter and 200-meter breast-
stroke as well as having contributed to the
record—setting 400-meter medley relay.
The ACC championship begin at 6 p.m. at
the Greensboro Aquatic Center and will con-
tinue through Saturday. The official ACC web-
site will stream the contests in their entirety.
