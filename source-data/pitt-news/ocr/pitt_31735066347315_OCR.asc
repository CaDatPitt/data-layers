 Pitt Police Lt. Seeks

Dismissal Explanation

§.

BY DEBBIE MOXIE

Campus Police Lt.‘ Stan Lowe is
awaiting a letter from Vice
Chancellor for Business and
Finance Joseph Dutton to explain
charges of insubordination which
led to his dismissal from the campus
police force on November 11.

Sources close to the situation
allege the insubordination charges
and subsequent dismissal were
unfairly levied by Campus Police
Chief Curt Graham for reasons

relating to the recent Campus Police "

strike. _

,Lowe’s request of Dutton, is the
second of three levels of appeal a
campus police officer is permitted to
use to seek satisfaction through the
Campus Police’s grievance proce-
dure.

The first, already taken by Lowe,
was to write a letter to Graham for
an explanation of the dismissal.
Sources report Graham refused to
justify the order of insubordination.

“l’m handling this issue privately
and without papers,” Dutton said.
‘ ‘I have written a letter to Mr. Lowe,
but it has not yet been sent.”

Under the provisions of the
grievance procedure Dutton is
required to reply to Lowe’s inquiry

' within ﬁve working days. ,

Sixteen Candidates

Take, Out SG Petitions

Sixteen candidates“ have taken
out petitions for Student Govern-

second day petitions for both

presidential and board candidates
were available. "

Paul Nyden said he will take his case to Federal Appeals Court if he is
not re-instated following the FAS Promotion and Tenure Review Board

indicated to the Pitt News that they

Twelve candidates have declared
interest in running for the Board

30, 1977, when Nyden’s initial
three-year contract expires, but
Nyden is continuing his charges
that his termination was inﬂuenced
by politics.

Presently, the case is in the hands
of the FAS Promotion and Tenure
Review Board, which is attempting
to determine whether Nyden has a

valid case and if his civil rights have

been violated.

The self-acknowledged Marxists
contends he is being ﬁred not
because his contribution to the
sociology department is substand-
ard, but because his class lectures
and published journals reflect a
Marxist political orientation.

The University contends the
senior faculty committee’s recom-
mendation for non-renewal, and the
subsequent acceptance of that
stance by Rosenberg, was based on
an evaluation of Nyden’s scholar-
ship and teaching.

Sociology department chairman
Burkhart Holzner said in an
interview last week, “The vote in
March against the renewal of
Nyden’s contract was in no way
based on his political beliefs. Nyden
was evaluated, and found lacking in
the area _of scholarship and
teaching.”

Holzner said he had no quarrel
with the excellent evaluation Nyden
received on his dissertation from

total rather than by a majority of
51 percent. The challenge came
after the votes for president, and

'external and internal vice-presi-
dents.

Heated debate arose when
there was a parliamentary
question as to what constitutes a
majority under the IFC consti-
tution.

The members of last year’s S

IFC Council then left the room
to decide whether to hold
another election. Those on last
year’s Council included
President Jay McNamara,
External Vice President Ezra
Krieg, Internal Vice President
Bart Huchel, and Secretary
John Powers, Treasurer Tim
Bonzo. Krieg and Powers were
both candidates affected by the
challenge.

When they returned, current‘

IFC. president Jay McNamara
said that 51 percent constituted
an electing ‘majority. The third
candidate, John Panizzo of
Delta Sigma Chi, was dropped
from the run-off election that
would have been between
Powers and Krieg.

Krieg then announced he had
withdrawn from the race.

“I’m sorry this had to hap-
pen,” Krieg said, “We should
just make our decision and
stand by it. I feel that John was
given a mandate and deserves
your support. I hope that if you
were to vote again he would
have been elected.”

The objection to the election
was first brought up ‘during the
election of IFC external vice
president. Richard Ross was
elected on the first ballot, but
not by a majority. The election
was held again after Krieg
contested the‘ elections and
Dave Horvitz won. ~

Dave Donovan was elected
internal vice president, Alan
Brader won the race for trea-
surer‘ and Steve Rossetti was
elected secretary, all with more
than 51 percent of the vote.

“Last year’s council is going
out with a bang and this one is
going to come in with a bang,”
Powers said.

   
   

PowersWins |FC~E|ection

Powers made a call for unity,

and outlined future plans he has -

for the IFC, which include
better communications with the
administration, the community
and the individual fraternities.
“There is a problem in com-
municating what fraternities are
to the public,” Powers said. “We
are involved in the leadership of
charity and community
programs -— we’re not just a
party organization that you just
see four weeks out of the year.”
The IFC must also get more of
the fraternities involved in the
system of the Council and its
campus activities, Powers said.

Sco Fl
Vaccination
Recomended

Pitt Health Educator Gerry Hyner‘
recommends Pitt students innocula-
ted against swine ‘ﬂu receive a
second vaccination that should be
administered four weeks after the
ﬁrst. ‘

Hyner said the originalvaccine
was only 30 percent effective for
adults between the ages of 18 and

24.
The second dosage should prove

to be 90 percent effective, Hyner
said. b
Although the decision is an
individual one, Hyner said, anyone
chronically ill should get a referral

from a physician before he gets a p

bi-valent injection that protects
against swine ﬂu and the A-Victoria
ﬂu virus. '

RSA Charges Student
With Piano Damage.

in PATTY TASCARELLA

The Resident Student Associa-
tion (RSA) damage control commit-
tee will bring Judicial Board
charges against a Pitt student for
damage done to a piano in the
Tower A Lounge on November 15.

The student will have a 10-day
period to prepare a case to be heard
before members of the Judicial
Board.

The decision to press charges
hinged on results of an investigation
of the incident by RSA members
Robert Savko and Tom Waskilko,

/

and Gerald Dalton of the Housing
Ofﬁce.

According to the report, a Tower
B resident who signed out keys to
the lounge later stated that as she
was playing, the piano fell down.
She then dropped the keys to the‘
door in the piano and pounded on
the door until custodians came to
her aid.

“She said herself that when she
went in, the piano was fine, ’ ’ Savko
said. He said the damage included
splintered and broken piano legs,
broken pedals and a hoodtthat had
been torn from its hinges.

Update: The Paul Nyden Case  

(Continued from Pagel) -
Columbia University. But it, and
his later works, tend toward
journalism rather than hardcore

sociological analysis of ﬁeld evi-

dence, Holznersaid.

“His ‘Miners for Democracy:
Struggle in the Coalﬁelds’ is a
remarkable piece of work, but
Nyden does not exhibit the ability
for sociological analysis in keeping
with standards maintained by the
department,” Holzner said.

Nyden contends he can not get an
unbiased evaluation of his work
within the University since the
sociology department is, with few
exceptions, anti-Marxist, and be-
cause . the University's Board of
Trustees is dominated by top
corporate executives——R. Heath
Larry, Vice Chairman of U. S. Steel;
‘George Stinson, Chairman of the
Board of National Steel; and George
Love, Honorary Chairman of
Consolidated Coal——the very people
Nyden’s manuscripts criticize.

“Of course I’m not going to

analyze the way they want me to,
I’m writing from working people's
point-of-view,” Nyden said.

‘ ‘I am nationally regarded as one
of the leading experts on the history
and sociology of the coal industry
and miners union .” Nyden said,
,“The past president. of the
American Sociology Association,
Alfred McC1ung Lee, voices support
for my work. Yet this department
finds me lacking in basic sociologi-

_, cal skills. ’ ’

In a letter to Rosenberg dated
June 17, 1976, in which Nyden
pressed to have his case brought
before the FAS Promotions and
Tenure Review Board, Nyden
argued, “If I had done work in
behalf of the coal companies or the
steel companies, I am sure my work
would have been praised by this

university’s sociology’ depart-
ment.” ‘ 0

Five FAS professors from the
Promotions and Tenure Review
Board—-two chosen by Rosenberg,
two by Nyden, with one mutual

choice—have been interviewing
principle persons within the sociol-
ogy department involved in the case
since October 8.

According to chairman of the
hearing board, Political Science
Professor Michael Margolis, the
board's investigation. will probably
be wrapped up by the end of this
term. Then, the committee will
submit a report of its ﬁndings to
Rosenberg, Nyden and Holzner._

“Our main concern is what the
thrust of our evaluation will have. It

is a complex case, with no side

being 100% right.
“We are not a court, just a

collegiate body that will give the

best interpretation we can on the
discrepancy,” Margolis said. “But
our evaluations can be disregard-
ed.”

If he is not reinstated, Nyden has.

said he will take his case to court. ‘ ‘I
hope the Board decision can resolve
my case. But if not, I will be taking
it to Federal Appeals Court, ’ ’
Nyden said.

Concerning the recent BAS
“show of power”:
It certainly took a lot of guts for
150 blacks to stage a protest against

some of the ludicrous demands. The
purpose of an institute of higher

education is just that. education!

fWliat right do we have imposing

ourselves in political issues in South
Africa? ‘ '
In reference to the second
demand, concerning the Campus
Police: .
Why are 70% of the arrests
Blacks? We have never seen

Campus Police harrassing anyone ~

—white, black, green or any other
color. Perhaps 70% of the crimes, on

A campus are committed by blacks.

We feel that the third demand can

be justiﬁed,» but where do the funds ,

needed to open the campus facilities
come from? Later in_ the lists of
demands is the’ complaints about

tiiition hikes: This vicious cycle only
‘warrants the complaints as being

made only for the sake of

Concerning the fourth demand:

Why should we have to
compensate for Pittsburgh’s white
to black ratio. Many students going
to this university are not from
Pittsburgh. If that is the case, then
abolish minority scholarships, and
have only . 25% of all athletic
scholarships awarded to blacks. We
feel that this practice is unfair to
other races. V ,

  BAS List Was Offensive

Student Government is an elected

body, elected by allof the students. '

Who gave the power to the BAS to
dictate the removal of the students’
choice. The chant, “Quit, Barry,
quit," does not show a responsible,
level-headed group. Rather, it was
an irresponsible, militant outburst.

Finally, we do not see how the
BAS can say tuition hikes hit blacks
harder than anyone else. Well, we
didn't go on welfare as the BAS
suggested. We got jobs and took out
loans in order to come to school.
There are many programs to help

aid people so that they can come to '

school. Everyone has a hard time
making ends meet—we do. Money
is tight everywhere.

We feel that the BAS protest was
militant and irresponsible; de-
mands were out of line, and they
were poorly stated. There are
proper channels, why did BAS
ignore them? This puts the
administration and other students

‘on the aggressive defense. Their
pre-planned protest was more of a
racial, antagonistic gesture, rather
than an honest attempt to solve the
community and school preblems.

Lettersto the Editor

    

  

Another club has been showing
films which were in Oakland only
several months ago. Granted, we
are "not a major film producer,”
but this double standard is not
logical, nor is it justifiable.
Repeated efforts have failed to
improve this.

We were not funded for any Pitt
News advertisements for our
largest program, an Italian folk
dance company. This program
alone cost several hundred dollars,
but because we were not sure of the
number of paying people (students
were not charged), allocations
withheld a request of only $76.00!
Our personal advertising efforts
were most inadequate. The
program fell short of our expected
attendance, mainly due to a lack of
good advertisement.

We are still a young club, only in
our second full year. We are trying
to establish ourselves, but are
éxperiencing more than the
expected growing pains. The Italian
Club does not condone violence.
However, we do wonder: is

violence, or the threat of violence,
the only means by which a group
can obtain their wants and needs?

We certainly hope this is not true.

Chestek-Put Up

The letter by Ken Chestek
entitled “Meanings Missed” is a
pitiful case. It is sadly infected with
the very affliction it seeks to cure.
Chestek derides Mulholland for
missing all the good rational
objections to Roe and Doe. They are

still missing, Mr. Chstek. Prithee,

— where are they?

Could you cite a reference or two, .
perhaps? Could you just explain
them a tiny bit? Do you know what
you are talking about?

Who Becomes/.\n RA?- Uncovering Some Myths

BY PATTY TASCARELLA

There are a lot of myths
surrounding the selection and the
duties of a resident assistant (RA)
and not all of them are favorable,

according to Tim Snyder, Assistant
Director of the Office of Residence
Life (ORL).

One popular misconception is
that the prospective RA must be a
member of a Resident Student

“Some students get involved
with the RSA only because they
want to be an RA,” Snyder said.

While leadership is an important
quality in an RA, other organiza-
tions beside RS_A have equal
weight. “It’s dumb to get involved
with the RSA for that reason. And if
candidates are on the RSA in name
only, then our staff will know this.”

Snyder stressed the need for
“being involved in a real way. That
kind of person has an edge if he did
it for a good reason, Sometimes,
people getinvolved with RSA just to
have it listed on their resume. We
look beneath the title.”

However, the most damaging
charge has been that the ORL often
hires RAs to spy on residents
prominent in student organizations.
According to a former member of
the RSA board, RAs are often asked
to keep close watch over student
leaders and on at least one occasion,
an RA who refused to comply with
ORL demands was fired.

“That’s probably one of the most
irresponsible statements ever
made,” Snyder said. “Spying in
that context is a dirty word. That’s
part of the myth of the educational
administrator. ’ ’

Snyder said that attitude is
particularly damaging because
many people who would make ﬁne
RAs believe this and won’t apply if
they feel it would mean working in a
“big brotherish” environment.

Snyder feels that the ORL
selective process is very effective in
screening prospective RAs.

“The people we get, by and
large, are all technically qualiﬁed
for the job. It’s not trying to decide
between the good and the bad
people——we want the best separa-
ted from the second-best. It’s very
difficult to tease out the speciﬁc
qualities«we’re looking for. In an

"interview situation, a person can

fake it,” he said.
. This is why, Snyder said, the ORL

" developed a series of different tests

to evaluate the applicants.

“The selection process is a
complicated thing,” Snyder contin-
ued. “We don’t want them to have
a lot of ready answers. We give a
battery of tests.”

The tests emphasized the use of
questions where ‘ ‘there isn't a right
answer.” Particularly revealing
Snyder said, is the essay asking ‘‘If
you could talk to anyone for an hour,
who would it be.” “We’ve had
people say things like they wanted
to talk to Wesley Posvar, their dead
father, of themselves ﬁfty years
from now. It gives us an idea of
their concerns.” I

“Then we have the group
exercises. It’s amazing. People
can’t help but be themselves. They
tend to exhibit their personalities,”
Snyder said.

“It’s a critical screening. People
who are questionable are not cut,
just people who don’t have what it
takes to be an RA. We only want
RAs who are able to contribute, to
be assertive without being aggres-
sive.

“Probably the overriding ability
one must have is to know how to
make individual decisions. It takes
an amazingly resilient kind of
person. He has to be proactive
rather than reactive,” Snyder said.

“We see them as educators but
not in the technical definition of
schooling. What they do is help
people get along in dealing with the
world whether it's in giving self
conﬁdence or dealing with beliefs, ’ "
Snyder explained. “I think_ all the
RAs really enjoy this job, I think
they really value the experience.
It’s not worth the room and board if
that’s all you’re interested in. It is
good preparation for a job, that’s
the learning experience. ’ ’

When all the evaluations are.in,
some are discarded outright, some
are conﬁrmed immediately as RAs
for the following year and the rest
are put on an alternates list. Snyder
says that 10 to 20 RAs change plans
over the summer so Alternates are
vital to the program. They are
encouraged to go through with teh
training procedures regular RAs
must attend.

Approximately one-third of the
RAs return for a second year, but
they are not guaranteed a position.
They do not reapply like the
novices, but they too must undergo
extensive testing. And even after
an RA holds a position, his status is
continuingly reevaluated by the

ORL, the area coordinator, and the
students.

Snyder was very enthusiastic
about the returns from this year’s
student evaluations. The return
rate in the past years yielded
approximately 30 percent of the
questionnaires being returned by
dorm residents; this year the results
were close to 70 percent. But, as
Snyder noted, “We don’t get all the
gripes there are.”

“We (ORL) need to improve in
our ability to communicate with the
students. You’re going to get cases
where we’ll select an RA who
doesn’t do a responsible job. You’re
not going to have glove-tight
supervision. We have faith ‘in our

RAs but if we ﬁnd something‘

lacking, we’ll take action,” he said.‘
While ORL Director Fred Fon-
seca has the ﬁnal say in selecting
the RAs, Snyder said that a check
and balance system provides for’
evaluations from several people.
“We have approximately twenty
pieces of evaluation ranging from
superﬁcial to extensive. We look for
similarities in opinion. If one
person says, ‘_This person will have
problems ‘dealing with racial

' attitudes,’ we don’t pay much

attention. But if ﬁve people say the
same thing...”

Residents are encouraged to «join
in the group interactions.

“We ask anyone who's interest-
ed,” Snyder said. “There have
been times when we recommend

' someone not evaluate. .In the past, a
lot of criticism has been levied at the
quality of the evaluators.”

Snyder said that often the student
representative has some degree of
leadership, like a floor representa-
tive, but he said that a “fresh
approach” from someone not
familiar with the workings of ORL is
also important. ,

VAccording to a survey of RAs,
they found the ability to put things
into perspective lists of desirable
qualities. Snyder agrees strongly
with this; it is important he said
because of the informality of the
system.

“It is an informal system,” he
said. “We need them just as much
as they need us.”

BY KEITH SRAKOCIC

A duet of acoustic guitar players,
Stan Newman and Rick Jones, sit

before the giant picture window.

inside The Portfolio, pickin’ and
croonin’ folk songs with a southern
air. The mood is mellow, the tempo
satisfying. Strains of “Tea for
Texas” ﬂow over the crowd,
followed by Newman’s singing
“Summer Song” in a voice
reminiscent of Gordon Lightfoot.
The beat picks up to a Paul Kraft
tune (done well considering the
smallness of room) “Dropkick Me

. Jesus, Through the Goalposts of

Life.” In this song and the next,
__“Queen of the Silver Dollar,” Jones
shows off his guitar strumming
ability: clean. But the next one
shows his song writing capabilities.
“About Goodbye” is a soft,
emotional song, pitifully wasted on
the dead ears of the audience
huddled around the tables engross-
ed in private conservations.
Showcasing talent seems to be
the major function of The Portfolio.
They have live acoustic music every
night, except on Tuesday, which is
‘open stage’ night——the only night
without a cover charge—for aspir-
ing musicians hoping forthat break.
But this showcase is not limited to

The lyrical sound of Mason’s

he lacks the ﬂashy technique of

strong vocals and arrangements.

Dance Group Takes
First Flight on Stage

BY DENISE DAILEY

It isn’t easy being a ﬂedgling
dance company. It is an extremely
tenuous existence, what with the
perils of personalities and econom-
ics. But in spite of it all, the
Pittsburgh Dance Alloy will spread
its wings in premiere performances
this Thursday and Friday.
Pittsburgh’s only active modern
dance repertory
appear at the Stephen Foster
Memorial Theatre, 8:00 p.m. this
Thursday and Friday—free.

Alloy was created in September
of this year, largely through the
efforts of Margaret Skrinar, assis-
tant instructor of dance at Pitt.
Helping with the audition and
selection of company members was
Kathryn Posin, who is in Pittsburgh
this year through the Pittsburgh
Dance Council as an Affiliate
Artist.

Nine area dancers were chosen:
Laurie Garon, Elsa Limbach,
Rebecca Rice, Tony Stafford, Janet
Gillespie, Margaret Skrinar, Mary
Ramsay, Denise. Dailey and Pat

Law. Most are students or teachers .

from various local universities.

Alloy i_s'a rather strange bird, as
modern dance species go. First of
all, it is a dance repertory company,
which means that it studies and
performs a variety of modern styles.
Also, members work to generate
experimentation with original chor-
eography from among themselves.
Second, rather than having a single
artistic director as most companies
do, direction of the group comes
with input from all the members.

Choreography, the art of making
dances, happens in a wide variety of

ways; as many ways, in fact, as.

there are choreographers. Alloy’s

Dancers Laurie Tarter, Rebecca Rice, Elsa Limbach, Tony Stafford,

company will

 

the original choreographer. In this
way, many great pieces done by
early stage artists are being kept
alive. Some of the better-known
contemporary pieces have been
notated as well.

“Pigeons on the Grass, Alas,
Alas” is a dance theatre piece
choreographed by Posin, a contem-
porary dancer/choreographer who
has her own company in New York
City. Posin adapted the work for
Alloy over a three-week period as
part of her services as affiliate
artist.

“Pigeons” is all about repetition.
Using the words and figures of
Gertrude Stein and Alice B. Toklas
with the ragtime piano of Bolcum,
Posin creates a witty, insightful
mini-drama,. perhaps from the
actual lives of two extraordinary
women.

Vastly different from the others is

“Reeds,” a piece by Tony Stafford, g

who is a student from Oberlin
college and dance member of Alloy.
Stafford has created a complex
dance by using chance procedures a
la John Cage and Merce Cunning-
ham.

Beginning with a series of set
movement phr'asés,~dice are thrown
to determine which'dan'cers would
perform which phrases and in which
order. The dissonant electronic
score by Schoenberg sets this
randomly determined piece in a
somewhat eerie mechanical atmos-
phere. *

“Tensile STrength’T is a humor-
ous piece choreographed by Mar-
garet Skrinar. Light and whimsical,
it focuses on the individual qualities
of each dancer. Non-dancers should
recognize much of the movement,
which is developed from our basic
experiences of walking, running,
and having a good time. The music

  
    

Janet Gillespie, Margaret Skrinar, Alexis Donnelly, Denise Dailey, Pat

Law and Mary Ramsey.

upcoming performances reﬂect the
diversity of such styles.

“Partita,” a “classical” modern
dance choreographed by Doris
Humphrey in 1942, is one of the first
dances that diverged‘ from the

purely. balletic tradition. Set to the _

music of Bach, Humphrey’s chor-
eography maintains many ballet-
like movements, but she injects a
lighter quality into this particular
piece which allows the dancers to
have fun on stage. This was
unusual and innovative at the time
the dance was created.

The piece was ‘set on’ (taught to)
the Company by Jane Marriett of
the recently formed Dance Notation
Bureau of New York City. The
Bureau uses an original system of
preserving dances which is called
‘Labanotation. ’

As a musical composer’s works
are perpetuated by his written
scores, so now a choreographer’s
work may be set on paper, or
notated, and subsequently brought
back to life, exactly as prescribed by

is Herbie Mann’s up-tempo ar-
rangement of the Beatle’s “Ob la
di, Ob la da.”

‘ Finally, Rebecca Rice, a graduate
assistant in dance at, Pitt, has
created a lyrical, beautifully ﬂowing
dance entitled “Sanguine Earth
Medley.” There is a sense of
abandonment to her piece expres-
sed through a circle-and-curve
danc€' pattern performed as a duet
by two women with rushing changes
of focus and energy. The solitary
guitar accompaniment, with its
slides and falls, enhances the
simple freedom of movement.

Rebecca is also the coordinator of
the Alloy’s premiere performance.

Beginning in January, company
members will provide dance classes
for beginning through advanced
students five days a week at Pitt.
These are open to everyone.

This premiere performance is an
important dance event. Pittsburgh
audiences will have an unique
opportunity to witness the taking-
off of a bright new bird. I

      Jackie Sherrill New Head Coach

Jackie Sherrill, former chief assistant for three years at Pitt, was-

officially named the Panthers’ new head coach Monday evening,
replacing Johnny Majors, who resigned last Friday to take the top job at

Tennessee.

BY STEVE SYBERT
Sports Editor

“Pittsburgh is very dear to me,”
said new Pitt head football coach
Jackie Sherrill at a news conference
yesterday at the Greentree Holiday
Inn. “I’m very happy to be back.”

Sherrill, the young (33 years old)
and dynamic Panther assistant head
coach and defensive coordinator
from 1973-75 and head coach at
Washington State this past season
was named, to no one’s surprise, as
Pitt’s new head coach on Monday.

. Wilson photo

He replaced departing Coach
Johnny Majors, who will return
home to Tennessee following the
Panthers’ Sugar Bowl encounter
with Georgia New Year’s Day.

“Faces in a crowd disappear and
fade away, but friends are never
forgotten,” Sherrill said, following
a meeting with the Washington
State squad Monday evening.
“And, certainly I’m very honored
and pleased with all the friends I
have ‘in Pittsburgh who have never
forgotten me. The decision was a

very difﬁcult one because I felt like I
was wanted and needed in both
Pittsburgh and Washington State,
and I am happy to accept the
challenge.’ ’

Sherrill was greeted with a round
of applause and smiles of apprecia-
tion by the Pittsburgh media at
yesterday’s news conference here.
He was introduced (a mere
formality) by Pitt Athletic Director

' Casimir Myslinski, who said, “We

are very happy we ﬁnally caught up
with the man we’ve been looking for
for the past week or so.

“We’re extremely happy to~have
Jackie coming back to Pitt because
he has played a large part in the
success of our program,” Myslinski
said. “Jackie was heavily involved
in the recruiting of our present
squad (he recruited Tony Dorsett,
by the way), and we know there’s a
good feeling between him and our
players. I am conﬁdent our football
program will continue on its present
successful level.’ ’

As a part of the outgoing Majors
regime,- Sherrill played a large role
while at Pitt, helping the team post
three successive winning seasons
and setting the stage for this year’s
shot at the national title and an
undefeated season.

“I’m ready for the challenge,”
Sherrill said yesterday, “and I
think, with the people here that are
behind the program, from the
Chancellor all the way down to the
janitor, the program is going in only
one direction. It’s going to sustain;
it’s still going to have excellency to
it. It’s going to have pride to it and
it’s going to continue in the right
direction. _

“The relationship that Coach
Majors and I-have had over the last
nine years has been very good,”
Sherrillcontinued. “When I took
the job, Coach Majors even called
me on a lot of decisions he had to
make this year about some things.
And I’m very honored. Coach
Majors gave me the opportunity to
grow; he gave me a lot of
responsibility to handle and I think
our relationship is very, very close
and naturally he has had an
influence on my life. But, again,
I’m not Coach Majors.” A

    Women Take Tourney

BY MARIA SCIU LLO

By surviving a second-half
comeback and the accurate outside
shooting of a Penn State freshman,

‘the Pantherettes defeated PSU’s

Lady Lions 71-66, Sunday to win the
third annual University of Pitts-
burgh Women’s Invitational Bas-
ketball Tournament.

of Pitt started out slowly, A but
/eventually ran up a 43-31 intermis-

‘_sion lead, dueimainly to frequent

baskets by 6-3 freshman center
Wanda Randolph and first-year
guard Kathy Paczkowski.

Again, the host team played
sluggishly at the beginning of the
second half and quickly, a series of
missed shots by Pitt and PSU scores
closed the gap.to 47-40. The Lady
Lions’ six-foot center Mag Stritt-
matter took advantage of Ran-
dolph’s second-half foul trouble,
began to pull down rebounds and
looked to be an immovable object.
At the same time, freshman
teammate -Jen Bednarek sank
several 15-foot baskets to draw
Penn -State closer vet.

A three-point play by Nancy Kuhl
brough Penn State to within three,
at 67-64, but from then on,
Randolph took over with several
minutes leftito play. Her driving
layup, followed by a blocked shot,

inspired the Pantherette defense to
pour it on for a ﬁve-point victory.

Despite Penn State cries of “Our
football «team may lose to you, but
not the girls from PSU! ’ ’ Pittsburgh
wrapped up its second home-
tournament championship.

“We knew beforehand that we
had to take away their fast break,”
explained Coach Pat Wallace, ‘ ‘and
by doing so, we controlled the
boards and the game.”

Leading the way for Pitt in the
ﬁnal was Randolph, who had 23
points, 21 rebounds, three steals,
one assist and two blocked shots.
Other top scorers were Paczkpwski,
ten points; Barb Welsh, 14; and Kit
Loefﬂer and ,Mimi Senkowski, with
six points apiece. Welsh also kept
the team going with some hustling
dives for loose balls.

For Penn State, it was Bednarek

‘with 14 points and a well-balanced

attack of 12 points each by
Strittmatter, Kuhl and Ginny
Johovich.

Getting into the championship
game was almost as tough as
winning it. After breezing by East
Stroudsburg State College on
Friday, 91-56, the Pantherettes
prepared to play Slippery Rock, an
86-62 victor over East Stroudsburg.

“They really surprised us,”
admitted Randolph, who netted 29
points against ESSC. “We came
out half-stepping and they really
took it to us,” she said of the

Rockets.

Motivated by big junior’ Patti
Bucklew, Slippery Rock hung with
Pitt until shortly after the second
half’s start. Then, good defense
prevailed and the Pantherettes led

‘by 19 points at one time.

The Rockets came back to within
striking distance at 63-48, but
couldn’t keep their drive going. Pitt
went on to win it, 74-60, as
Senkowski came close to watching
Bucklew’s 19 tallies, with 18.

The story was much the same for
the tournament runners-up. They
had little trouble in trampling West
Virginia University for a 104-69
ﬁrst-round win. The next step was
much harder, however, as they
turned back a determined Edinboro
by a score of 78-75.

The Lady Lions saw an 18-point
lead fritter away in the second half,
but were eventually saved by
Kuhl’s ﬁeld goal in the last minute
of the game, followed by a pair of
Betty McGuire free throws.

PANTHERETTE NOTES: Edin-
boro’s Lady Scots captured third
place in the tournament with a 92-75
triumph over Slippery Rock while
ESSC brought down the Mountain-
eers, 91-57, to take ﬁfth...in three
games, the champions’ Wanda
Randolph totaled 62 points and
grabbed rebounds...next on the
agenda is the Mississippi Invita-

December 17 and 18.

Sherrill joined Majors as an
assistant at Iowa State in 1968, was
-named assistant_ head coach and
defensive coordinator there two

years later, then followed Majors to I

Pitt in 1973. A native of
Mississippi, Sherrill was All-State
and honorable mention All-Ameri-
can at Biloxi High School. He
played various positions under
Coach Bear Bryant at Alabama, won
three letters, was a member of the
1964 and 1965 national champion-
ship teams’ and appeared in two
Sugar Bowls and an Orange Bowl.
He entered coaching in 1966 as an
assistant at Alabama, then transfer-
red to Arkansas as an aide a year
later. Sherrill and his wife, Daryle,
a native of Elizabeth, Pa., were
married in 1973.

“The challenge here is an
honor,” Sherrill said. “lt’s an
honor to step into Coach Majors’
shoes because he’s been very dear
to me. He.’s given me an

A opportunity and he’s done a lot of

things for me.”
Sherrill, who said before the

season that Pitt would go undefeat-'

ed and win the national champion-
ship, is a favorite among the players
as well as a hard—nosed recruiter. ,

‘ ‘I have the respect of the players
and the friendship of the players,”
he said. “I have never been a
person who elevates himself above
the players, because I think on the
ﬁeld, it’s ‘a coach-player relation-
ship and off the ﬁeld, it’s a very
personal relationship, because they
put a lot of trust in you and in the

‘ school and you have to recipro-

cate.”.

First among Sherrill’s plans is to
get the ﬁle of high school recruits
and hit the road to entice the hot
prospects‘ into coming" to Pitt.

Controversy arose when it was
found that Majors had taken copies
of the reports with him to
Tennessee.

“I really don’t care,” Sherrill
said. “I think if he wants to take a
copy that’s upato him. I don’t think
Coach Majors will come and recruit
a kid here from Pittsburgh. The
only way Coach Majors would
recruit anybody is if the young man
did not want to come to Pitt. I can
promise you that Coach Majors will
not. '

“There’s a lot of loyalty and
respect between coaches and that’s

Sports

something you just don’t do,” he
continued. ‘ ‘And certainly with the
integrity of Coach Majors, and
myself, it won’t happen.» I can
assure you that the transition will be
very cordial and Coach Majors will
do whatever he can for the
University of Pittsburgh. ’ ’

Sherrill, who signed a five-year
contract, is reportedly seeking to
bring to Pitt another former Panther
assistant, Bob Leahy, the ex-Steeler
quarterback -and an aide at
Washington State, along with Otto
Stowe, the Cougars’ receiver coach
and former pro standout. ‘

“This is a happy day for the
University, ’ ’ proclaimed Chancellor
Wesley W. Posvar. ‘

Majors’ Staff Gone;

Avezzano Miami-Bound?  

BY CRIS HALL

John Majors won’t be packing any of his Panther players when he
officially takes up residence in Knoxville January 2, but it appears he’ll
be absconding with most, if not all, of his coaching staff. K

Assistant head coach Joe Madden already has accepted a similar

position at Tennessee.

And, Unless the vacant Arkansas job

unexpectedly becomes available to him, defensive coordinator Bobby
Roper will be a relatively short drive from the Grand 01’ Opry House
after New Year’s, much to his country western delight.
Administrative aides (coaches are called ‘ ‘administrative aides’? after
a school has amassed the maximum number of coaches the NCAA
allows) Henry Lee Parker and Bruce Mays are in Knoxville right now,

working on Majors’ Tennessee

transition.

Quarterback coach Bill Cox
already is practicing his drawl, and

several other coaches—defensive. ‘

end coach Larry Holton, running
back coach Harry Jones, defensive
line coach Jim Dyar and junior
varsity coach Bob Matey—are
studying Knoxville roadmaps, pre-
paring for a not-too-unlikely switch

wars.

The man with probably the best ,

 

 

JOE AVEZZANO

chance of splitting from Majors is offensive coordinator Joe Avezzano,
but before you get overly excited about the thought of him staying in
Pittsburgh, be aware that the only thing keeping Avezzano from the Vols
is the vacant head coaching position at Miami, Fla. " ’
Avezzano, who attended Miami’s Jackson High School and was
responsible for luring several Florida schoolboy standouts to Pitt, is
“actively campaigning” for the job as head Hurricane, according to a

reliable Miami source.

Avezzano called Miami athletic director Pete Elliot Sunday
concerning the job, and mailed his application Mogday.

Avezzano is “very high” on Miami’s list of candidates, according to
one source close to the situation, and said last night that he has been
invited to visit Miami later this week to discuss the position with Elliot
and Dr.‘ John Green, the University’s executive vice president and the
man who will make the ﬁnal decision on a coach.

“The Miami job is ideal for a young, aggressive person,” Avezzano
said last night. ‘ ‘—It’s made for someone who can move his feet fast. I’ve
been in a similar rebuilding situation twice, and it’s been very rewarding

each time.

Keeping That Promise

BY JIM "LEWIS

The Pitt wrestling team is
promising, yet isn’t promising.

What?

You see, it’s like this: the
Panthers are ;a young, talented
squad with a promising future, but
going into tomorrow’s 7:30‘p.m.
contest against the Maryland
Terrapins at Fitzgerald Field House
(students free with ID; otherwise,
general admission $1), Head Coach
Dave Adams isn’t promising a
concrete starting lineup.

Injuries and competition for
starting berths leave three weight
classes up in the air. At 118 pounds,
injured freshman Bill Clark (a 10-1
winner against Akron) or freshman

Jose Martinez will start; at 126, it A

will again be either of two
freshmen——Steve Carter (a 3-1
victor at Akron) or Jack Kline, while‘
at 177 two veterans—Bruce Hugg-
1er(who pinned his Akron opponent
in 2:36) or Don Amdt will get the
call.

Meanwhile, the rest of the
tentative starting lineup is about the
same as the one which plundered
poor Akron, 36-16, except that
Randy Dick will take over at 134,
after injuries to All-American
Rande Stottlemyer and Gregg
Soergel, and Kevin McNamara will
wrestle at 150 after Ed Bredniak
was moved down to 142.

But, despite the changes, a good
performance against the Terrapins
looks promising for Pitt (1-0).

,,“I look for a very close, exciting
match,” Adams vowed. “I’ve
always been under the impression
that they’ve been out to get us.”

Bob Bailey, student coach who
was a member of the 1975 Panther

/

  DAVE umsou

squad that mopped up Maryland
28-11 last season, agrees.

“They’re physically hard,” Bail-
ey commented. “They getup for us
and always seem to ﬁght us out
there.”

So is a win tomorrow night
possible? I

“A win depends on how we do in
the first ﬁve or six matches,”
Adams stated. “But with the
experience ‘that we’ve gained at
Penn State (a ﬁfth-place ﬁnish at
the Penn State Invitational in a
tough ﬁeld of eight) we will
deﬁnitely improve.”

Yes, the ﬁrst ﬁve or six matches
will definitely be interesting. The
first ﬁve starting Terrapins (weight
classes 118, 126, 134, 142 and 150)
each has a winning record, while the
heaviest four starters (167, 177, 190
and heavyweight) are wrestlers who
together, have lost only three times
in sixteen chances so far.

Two bouts to watch are at 167,

where PSU Invitational champ Skip 

Bolin will face Terrapin co-captain
Steve Hogg (a 3-1 record on the

year), and 177, where Maryland’s '
‘Steve I-Ieger (champion of the

Atlantic Coast Conference in his
class last season) goes up against
either Huggler or Amdt.

So Maryland promises to be
tough, and the week doesn’t
promise to get any easier.
Bloomsburg follows the Terrapins
into Oakland Saturday afternoon,
marking Pitt’s Eastern Wrestling
League season debut.

But Adams isn’t worried about
Bloomsburg right now.

“Bloomsburg has a very good,
improved team,” Adams explain-

ed,” but we can’t afford to look L
We have »

ahead to them yet.
Maryland on our hands ﬁrst.”

And the Terps are quite a
handful, as is Bloomsburg. All in
all, it promises to be a great three
days of wrestling.

Is It “Hurricane” Joe?

(Continued from" Page 10)

Selmer, who was ﬁred after a 3-8 season.
“My aspiration is to be a head coach,’ ’ he said. ‘ ‘It’s approaching the
time I hope to be a head coach, if that time isn’t here already.”
Avezzano’s chances for the Miami job increased considerably when
several candidates ranked above him by Hurricane officials refused to

consider the job.

“At ﬁrst, they had a list that was a ltitle unrealistic, ’ ’ Avezzano said.
“They wanted people like (former Notre Dame coach) Ara Parseghian,
(Texas Tech coach) Steve Sloan and (recently axed Tennessee coach) Bill V
Battle—people they weren’t going to get.

“I’m always interested in anybody who wants to talk about a head

‘coaching job,” Avezzano said. “That’s not to say I’d jump at any head

coaching position offered. I’m working for a great guy right now. If none
of the head coaching positions I’m looking at are available to me, I’ll be-
going.to Tennessee with Coach Majors.”

There’s that name again--—Tennessee. Avezzano may not be satisﬁed
if he has to give Knoxville the nod, but he certainly won’t be lonely,

either.
