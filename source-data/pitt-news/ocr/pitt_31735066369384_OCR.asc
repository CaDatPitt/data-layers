The University Placement Cen-
ter has begun a promotion
campaign geared to small and
middle-sized businesses. The
center is ﬂooding the media
with its message “We’ve got

fessionals matched to your
needsf’

According to Dan Nagy,
director of placement. the
campaign is the first of its kind
in the country.

A 24 hour danemarathon was held this Fidy andaturday the Student Union ballroom to benefit the 0

through the entire marathon. Carol Barone and Ron Davidson, shown above, represented Kappa Kappa Gamma

 

‘ here that has never been tried
before, and that's basically to
advertise,” he said

Nagy said that the whole
program is geared to increase 4
the awareness of employers to
call the center about their job
needs. It uses billboards, radio
ads, television public service
announcements, letters and a
public speaking tour to reach
businesses.

“There are a lot of employ-
ers out there who have never
used the university for filling
their needs for college grad-
uates," said Nagy. “Many of

them go to employment ‘agen-
cies and pay a fee,‘ and the
student must also pay a fee to
match it. The difﬁculty in
‘ getting a job is finding out what
jobs are available.” 4 -

According to Nagy, the
center is using a computer
system to increase the eff1cien- '
cy of matching the right
student with the right job.

“With a computer, our job is
much easierand the student is
treated fairer than if we used
alphabetical cards as we did in
the past,”he said.

The center acquired the

nouncements will begin this
week, Nagy said.

“The radio ads will be
broadcast over KDKA and
WTAE radio stations in the
early morning,” he said. “And
next week we will be mailing
brochures to 8.000 employ-
ers.” '

Nagy said that the promotion
campaign is a one-time project.

Cafeteria
Negotiations
In Deadlock_

"Last week’s meetings between
representatives of the food service
employees and Key Management
Services, the company operating
the Towers and Scaife cafeterias,
did not produce a settlement. 0’

According to Key Management 

lawyer, John Alder, a new proposal
was presented Friday to Local 29 of
the Service Employees Interna-
tional Union, AFL-CIO, which
represents the employees.

Alder said negotiations may

continue this week, but no new

meetings have yet been arranged,
pending the union is consideration
of the proposal.

He said wages and other
“economic issues” were being
negotiated, but refused to state
further details of the proposal. ,

Union and management officials
agreed not to disclose details of the
contract or negotiations, but both
reported that progress had been
made.

encouraging more employers to
contact us with jobs, we would
like to do it again, of course,
but it is costly,” he said.

Use of the service is free,‘
according to Nagy and the T
money for the promotional
campaign is being funded with
donations for unrestricted use
given to the university by
alumni and other Pitt sup-
porters.

“The bottom line is to try T .

and create more openings for
our students,” said Nagy.
"Our whole push is, why not

Pitt Receives $100,000 Gift to Enrich Humaiies Proam 

By GARY TWEED
Put l\l:\AV Sl.1lll'W'l'|l~:r

The National Endowment For
Humanities (NEH) has awarded a
$100,000 grant to the University of
Pittsburgh, to be used to expand
and enrich the school’s humanities
programs, Dr. Benjamin F. Bart,
professor of French, announced
today. ' ,

The grant was bestowed for a
program that is to be directed by
Bart, titled “Restructuring the
Humanities at the University of
Pittsburgh.”

Joseph D. Duffey, NEH chair-
man, wrote in his letter informing
the university of the grant:

“The fact that competition for

endowment funds has always been
keen and that we have been able to
fund no more that one in every five

applicatiQns...attests to the super- -

ior quality of this proposal and the
importance of Prof. Bart's work.”

“The grant is unique. It is not a
research or equipment grant. And
it demonstrates Pitt’s commitment
and NEH’s support for excellence
in undergraduate teaching," Bart
said. ,

“Our job is to bring the
humanities to the whole univer-
sity," he continued. “In our
increasingly technological society
and in a world in which the
individual often feels a tiny.
unimportant cog, humanities

courses are essential to let the
student rediscover the central
importance of human beings and
their values. Our age is only dimly
aware that all things interconnect.
For that reason our new endeavor
will provide courses that span the
breadth of our tradition and
exemplify its riches."

Bart explained that the grant,
which extends over 1979-80, will be
used in large ‘part for the
development of 21 interdisciplinary
courses in the humanities. Two of
the new courses will be offered fall
term, 1979. ‘

The first course, titled “The
American Cowboy in Fact and

. a chance to see this spring—-

“A Death in Astapovo,” currently produced by
the University Theater, is an original work of Pitt
drama professor Leon Katz. it concerns the last
days of the Russian writer Tolstoy, and his over-
demanding wife Sonya’s frantic attempts to
locate him. Staff writer Bill Sell reviews the play.
Elsewhere, Gertrude Stein's "Made By Two" is
being produced by Theatre Express. According
to staff writer Mark Holan, its a good ‘effort and
could become one of the better plays you’ll have
page 8.

Skip Bolin was the only Panther wrestler able to
win a bout at the NCAA championships in Ames,
Iowa this past weekend. Pitt, along with six
other Eastern Wrestling League teams, seemed
to tighten up and had sub-par performances.
Assistant Sports Editor Jim Lewis reviews the
action. Karen Kadilak reports on “Swim Week,"
starting today at Trees Hall. Swimmers from
across the nation will be competing Wednesday
through Saturday. Also, reports from spring
training camps in Florida are in the sportspages

A cloud of smoke reminiscent of the dark days A
of Oakland in the 1940s and '50s hung over
campus yesterday afternoon. The smoke

the second time NEH has funded
the university .for humanities
courses. Another grant, awarded
four years ago, supported the
Comparative World Literature
program, which Bart also directed.

The success of that program--en- /

rollments increased from 600 to
over 2,000 in four years—-played a
significant role in the NEH,’s
decision to bestow the grant. Bart
said.

‘.‘The new grant,” he stated, “is

a recognition of the university's ,

success in these endeavors and will
help Pitt develop a wider range
ofbroadly based courses to offer its
undergraduate students."

ONE YEAR AGO

It was time for Chancellor Posvar to play his annual budget
game this time last year, when he delivered his pitch to the
State House Appropriations Committee for more funding for
Pitt. Posvar asked the committee for an additional $10.5
million bringing Pitt’s total request to $70.9 million.
Posvar said the additional funds were necessary to avert

another tuition hike. Of course we all know how this story i I

ended. I

Women’s groups strongly opposed a proposal by the Student
Congress to allow women to become cheerleaders at Pitt.
These groups did not favor the measure terming women
cheerleaders as being “unfeminine” and “not appropriate for
mature young women.” Sue Murphy where would you be

year we have something new-
Triangle fraternity and the Society
of Women Engineers have entered
the competition.” The Freshmen
engineers also compete as a unit,
separate from the seven engin-
eering ‘departments: chemical,
civil, electrical, industrial, mechan-
ical, metallurgy and materials, and
mining.

Each department has chosen a
particular comic strip, and “every-
thing they do for the week revolves
around their theme,” Aloise said.

, “Points are‘awarded in five of the
“events--the blood drive, gimmick,

game night, the parade and the
derby. 0

“I think the competition is lots
stronger this year,” Aloise added.

“The chemical engineers have won
for the past two years, and it just
wouldn’t do to let them get it again.

There seems to be greater
interest--more people working on
the entries.” ~

Gimmick events, beginning at 4’

p.m. Wednesday on the Cathedral
lawn, include traditional races such
as relay, five-legged, and sack
races, and orange passing. The
fnajor event is the tug-of-war,
according to Aloise. ‘
At Game Night, each department
sets up carnival games related to

. its theme. In addition. two persons

from each department will partici-
pate in an all-night monopoly game
on a gigantic board.

“The board is as wide as a
hallway,” Aloise said, “and the

Attendance also counts towards
the award. “Fifty percent of the
attendance points are for the actual
number attending from the depart-
ment, and the other half are for the

percentage in attendance, so that a _

small department won’t be at a‘
disadvantage,” Aloise explained.
Non—engineering students who
want to participate in the carnival
games can elect to play for a
particular department, she added.

The master of ceremonies for

this year’s parade is Colonel Yore_

from the Army Corps of Engineers.

judged on technical complexity,
construction, and originality,
Aloise said. The highlight of the
parade is the arrivalof St. Patrick

“The method of his arrival is
always a secret and always
different,” Aloise said. “One
year, he came in a helicopter;
another time it was in a sheik’s car
complete with a harem.” The
identity of the student who plays
St. Patrick is also unknown.

In other years, engineers from
branch campuses such as
Johnstown and Titusville have
entered the soap box derby. No
entries had been received from
them this year due to a mix-up in

the mail, Aloise said, but more

literature was sent to them when
the mistake was discovered.
Another slight departure from
tradition will take place at the

Approximately 25 members of the

attending the slide presentations

‘along with the parents of engi-

“They (the scouts) are investi-
gating various technical fields,”
Aloise said, “so they contacted us
about attending. We considered
inviting other high school stu-
dents, but it conflicted with
recruiting plans already made.”

Though a Pitt tradition, Engin-
eers Week originated at the
University of Missouri in 1903 and
came to Pitt in 1954. "I think the
first participants were expelled for
about 2 years.” Aloise said, “but

Opinion

More Words
Of Gloom

The expected words of doom and gloom came
from Chancellor Wesley Posvar last week after Gov.
Thornburgh announced his proposed appropriation
for Pitt. —

“The very modest increase in the governor's
budget for Pitt and the other state-related universities
is far below our needs and whatwe requested from
the state. . . The presidents of the other state-related
universities and I advised the governor that, in these
circumstances, stringent budget measures and tuition
increases are unavoidable,” the chancellor said in a
statement released Wednesday.

The scenario that will unfold in the next few
months is easy to foretell. At the budget hearings of
the state House and Senate, Posvar will warn that the
lower middle-class is being priced out of the
education market because of insufficient state ap-
propriations. In the end, the university will receive
the appropriation suggested by the governor, and
tuition willrise again at Pitt.

Letters

Along with the chancellor’s trips to Harrisburg,
there will be the lobbying efforts of the Student

‘Government Board’s Public, and Governmental

Relations committee. The well-meaning committee
members will bend the ear of every legislator who will
listen, but win few results because the lawmakers
know college students don’t vote.

This same little play has occurred for the last
several years and it is time that it should stop.
Pennsylvania is in dire financial straits and neither
administrators nor students can expect state govern-
ment to solve Pitt’s money problems. It is time the
university took steps on its own to cut expenses here,
especially focusing on personnel cuts in Pitt’s
burgeoning bureaucracy.

Although the adminstration has tried to cut energy
costs and controlled faculty expansion, these steps
have had insignificant impact. While there have been
cutbacks in these areas, Pitt overflows with vice
Chancellors, assistant vice Chancellors, executive
assistants, directors, managers and their army of
subordinates.

In the Office of Student Activities, there are six
advisors paid to oversee student government, the
Greeks, student publications and the Black Action
Society. This is just one example of unnecessary per-
sonnel. Pitt could easily do as most other colleges do
and have interested faculty members double as ad-
visors to all student groups. This would not only
save money, but help develope ties between un-
dergraduates and faculty that are nearly nonexistent
at Pitt.

The division of responsibility for the residence
halls between_the Office of Residence Life and the
Housing.Office also seems to be wasted labor. Since
the two offices fulfill overlapping duties, they could
be combined and the positions within them could be
diminished. The consolidation would not only
reduce costs, but help make the notoriously

A *0
Page 6—Monday, March 12, 1979 ’

unresponsive Housing Office more sensitive to
students’ needs. I

The university could examine its other offices to
see which could be combined also. Pitt could learn a
lesson from Thornburgh, who has many of his top
cabinet members serving two capacities.

While Pitt cuts its bureaucratic personnel, it could

also curb the luxuries enjoyed by top administrators.

To do this, Pitt officials could look for inspiration to
Gov. Jerry Brown of California, who gave up the.
governor’s mansion for an austere apartment, and to

Carter aides who drive their own cars instead of using 1,

chauffeured limosines.

If university officials do not take these steps to
curb costs, we can look forward to many more years
of tuition increases and less sympathetic legislators in
Harrisburg. Thornburgh has shown his good faith
by increasing our appropriation four percent. Pitt
should respond by taking more steps to curb expenses

in administration. Merely whining for more money

at appropriations hearings is not the answer to our
budget problems.

Schulman ’s ‘Open  Minded ’ Review of A . C.

The lesson to be learned from the
recent ﬁght over the Alternative
Curriculum program is a lesson
that should be learned in every
course in a liberal education but is
rarely mentioned at Pitt: there is
much more to understanding than
amassing facts.

_The words that College of Arts
and Sciences Dean Irwin Schulman
has used, both in his March 7 letter
to.The Pitt News and in various
CAS Council meetings. may seem
very reasonable and.sensible—if
one does not step outside his

‘ narrow academic world-view of

knowledge acquisition and bud-
gets. It may make sense that _he
unilaterally withheld listing the
program in the course description
newspaper and time schedule
because he thought it might not
exist next fall and it would prevent
‘accidental registrations". Even if

i the coordinators

the program did exist it could be
better advertised elsewhere.

Such a move robbed program
coordinators of some of their
responsibilities. without consulta-
tion with the coordinators. even
after one of the coordinators
learned of the dean's intention and
received the impression that the
program would be included in the
registration materials. But Schul-
man withheld the listings and did
not bother to tell the coordinators
(they found out just like everyone
else by reading these materials).
and no “accidental registrations”
could possibly take place since
specialpermission is needed from
in order to
register. Adding all these facts
may change one’s understanding of
the programs fight for survival and
the dean's Machiavellian exercise
of power. But, they may not.

’ Regardless of that, the rest of
Schulman's actions and words will
probably make sense unless one
realizes that equally important to
understanding is interpretation. l
am sure the dean feels he was
neutral in his presentation of the
programs case to council. It is an
objective fact that in a time of
seemingly tight money cutting
$10,000 going to a struggling
program can save a budget.
However. prefacing each discus-
sion of the program with the
problem of needing to cut
spending. especially without laying
out alternatives or the whole
financial situation of CAS and the
university, would, according to my
interpretation. bias any body. We
may perhaps find some support for
this interpretation in the large

It ’s Students vs. Administration Over Housing at UPJ

Currently at the University of
Pittsburgh at Johnstown there is a
controversy raging between stu-
dents, mainly residents, and top
administrators concerning the uni-
versity's enrollment and housing
policies.

The controversy arose as a result
of the university’s announcement
that, because of a projected
decrease in commuter enroll-
ment. extensive tripling of rooms at
UPJ would be necessary in order to

reach target enrollment figures for
fall. I979.

Students were subsequently
presented with a housing directive

that required housing for art
additional 158 students over
current housing capacity; re-

sulting. of cottrse. in extensive

tripling.

Students object to this proposed
“overstuffing" of the campus
residence facilities and continue to
protest against what they consider
to be the administrators‘ lack of
concern and cooperation in coming
up with another solution. Students
feel that such overcrowded con-
ditions will not only cause a decline
in everyday living conditions on
campus but will also be reflected in
a decline of academic life.

Students are not objecting to the
total enrollment figures. just the
unrealistic expectations of crowd-
ing so many people into so few

housing facilities on campus.

The administration's present
proposal puts the burden of tripling
predominately on the shoulders of
the upperclassmen. Although
students have completely rejected
this proposal. their objections are
not merely ones of self interest.

The student body feels that the
freedoms. the beauty and the
overall living conditions that have
made UPJ such a desired campus
in the Pitt system will be
jeopardized if the administration
attempts to force students to accept
the reality that a 158 student
overflow will be housed in the
current residence facilities.

Students have made several

suggestions to alleviate the prob-
lem, including housing for students
locations

at off-campus on a

voluntary basis. improved trans-
portation to and from campus to
provide an incentive for off—carnpus
housing. and increased efforts to
obtain more commuters from the
local area (so that total target
enrollment can be met with less
people having to reside on
camptts).

So far the students have not
received any satisfaction from the
administration. They have only
heard bleak forecasts of academic
program cutbacks and the impo-

Dramatic Encounters Highlight,  
Katz’ ‘A Death in Astapovo’ y

By BILL SELL

Pitt News Staffwriter

A Death in Astappvo
University Theater

Pitt drama professor Leon Katz’s
original play dealing with the last
days of Tolstoy, “A Death in
Astapovo,” is currently being
performed by the University
Theater in a credible production.

Sonya, Tolstoy’s over-de-
manding wife, has heard that her
estranged husband is dying, and
may be found in the small town of
Astapovo. With her three sons and
daughter, she travels by. train to
Astapovo, ﬁnally arriving at the
station, after a long ride.

At the station, it is apparent she
is in great agony over the failing
health of Tolstoy. Much to her
despair, however, she is refused
information of her husband’s

whereabouts. (At this time in
Russian history, Tolstoy was very
well known. Any information about
his location would draw a hoard of
photographers and reporters.)

When Sonya discovers her
husband is staying at the station
master’s house, she frantically
tries to visit him. Despite her
efforts, she is refused entrance into
his room.

For awhile she throws tremen-
dous tantrums: begging and
pleading for just a glimpse of her

I dying husband. This also fails, but

she doesn’t give up. She demands
to see Chertkov, Tolstoy’s leading
disciple and friend, because, “he
can help me.”

When Chertkov and Sonya
finally meet, he tells her, “if
Tolstoy sees you or even knows
you are close by, it could mean a
hastier death.”

Sonya Andreyevna Tolstoy, is
skillfully portrayed by Jocelyn
Johnson. Johnson’s performance
is quite commendable. From the
very start she takes control of the
stage, setting the tempo with her
dynamic personality. The audience
could feel her emotions. Some of
the best scenes were very intense
arguments between the countess
and Tanya, her‘ illegitimate
daughter.

Stage manager Elizabeth
McKenna and the rest of the stage
crew deserve credit for the job they
did on the set. The whole play
takes place at a train station that is
authentic down to the train tracks.

Although “A Death in Asta-
povo” has some good scenes, it
seems to drag. But two and a half
hours is a long time to sit through
anything. »

Theatre Express
Interprets Stein

Made By Two
Directed by Tom Heam
Theatre Express

If you can free yourself of the
notion that plays must have readily
discernable plots, then Theatre
Express’ production of Gertrude
Stein’s “Made By Two” will
become one of the most tender and
delightful works you're likely to see
this season.

Fully titled “A Lyrical Opera
Made By Two To Be Sung," this is
the premiere presentation of
Stein's 50-year-old libretto.

The cast is small; three women

supported by four secondary

actors. Two of the women, Joan
Kimmel and Susan Cash, portray
the same person at different ages.
Cash playsthe woman in her youth.
The third actress, Catherine
Roberts, plays the lover ofithe
younger woman.

“Made By Two" is about the

relationship between the two (A

younger women. The olderwoman
acts primarily as a narrator.

In the playbill, director Tom
Hearn asserts that Stein “drew
heavily from her own life and her
relationship with Alice B. Toklas to
give us her ideas of what love and
living and sharing with another
person should be.”

‘‘‘Made By Two’ became, fo:
me, an old woman remembering
her shared life with someone else," _

‘Tartuffe’

Played Amusingly

In Revival

By CHRIS LYNN

Those who wonder how men can
be fooled will nearly adore the
outrageous hypocrisy of Moliere’s
“Tartuffe,” performed by the
Pittsburgh Metropolitan Stage Co.

arranging for him to marry his

An eavesdropping session is
then arranged so Orgon can hear
Tartuffe state his passionate lust
for Orgon’s wife, and Tartuffe is
exposed. With the king's
intervention, Orgon recovers the
deed and will from Tartuffe. who is
sent to his punishment.

Moliere first presented his play
in Louis XIV’s France as a satire of
the extreme life of the king’s court.
Having no middle ground was
Orgon’s problem, and the king’s as
well. The play ends with a motion
to kneel before the throne of the
king in thanks; a motion for
Moliere to save his own neck.

‘Swim Week’ Begins Today as Women Host Championships

By KAREN KADILAK
Pitt News Staff Writer

Swim Week starts in Pittsburgh
today as swimmers from across the
nation arrive for the Association of
Intercollegiate Athletics for Wo-
men Championship at Trees Pool
Wednesday through Saturday.

. This week has been designated
“AIAW National Swim Week” by
the Allegheny County commis-
sioners. Posters commemorating
the occasion have been hung at the
Greater Pittsburgh International
Airport.

Many of the 600 competitors.
representing 78 teams, are expec-
ted to arrive both today and
tomorrow, although some arrived
as early as Saturday.

mainly because it’s a pre-Olympic
year and the Pan-American games
are this summer,” said Pitt
associate swim coach Kate Mathi-
son, who is directing the champion-
ship with Pantherette head coach
Dick Bradshaw.

“We have a fast pool,”
Mathison added. ‘We're expecting
some outstanding times."

The top ten scorers from last
year‘s championship, including
sixth-place Kathy Stetler, will be
returning this year. The Pitt

all-American is one of the many S

Olympic candidates who will
compete.

Defending champion Arizona
state is among the early favorites in
the battle for the team title. ‘ Pitt,

“It’s going to be a great meet which finished 14th in last season’s

championship at. Duke University
in Durham, N.C., expects to crack
the top ten.

The meet starts at 7 p.m.
Wednesday, when the diving
preliminaries and semi-ﬁnals will
be held, and it continues through
Saturday night.

Swimming preliminaries are
scheduled daily Thursday through
Saturday. The preliminaries start
at 11 a.m. and the ﬁnals at 7 p.m.
each day.

No student tickets are available.
Daily admission is $3 for the
preliminaries and $5 for the finals.
Tickets for Wednesday's diving
competition are $3.

An all-sessions combination tick-
et costs $20. \Tickets may be
purchased at the ticket ofﬁce at Pitt
Stadium.

Bolin Only Winner
At NCAA Finals

By JIM LEWIS
Pitt News Asst. SD0l’Is Editor '

Panther 167-pound senior Skip
Bolin was the only Pitt wrestler of
four to win a bout at the NCAA
championships in Ames, Iowa, this
weekend.

Bolin decisioned Air Force’s
Dale Walters, 14-8, in the first
round to score the Panthers’ only
team point. He lost in second
round action to Utah State’s Mark
Harris, who pinned him at 1:10.

Tom Jones, 158 pounds, was the
only Pitt wrestler to qualify for the
consolation round. He lost to
second-seeded Dan Silverberg of
Minnesota, 14-6, in the first round
and earned the right to compete in
the consolations when Silverberg
advanced to the semi-finals. Jones
then lost, 7-6, to Drake’s Oscar
Ordonez.

Otherwise, Pitt was eliminated
early. Glenn Maxwell, 118 pounds,
fell to Indiana State’s Angelo
Marino, 8-2, in the first round,
while 126-pounder Jose Martinez
was decisioned by Missouri’s Keith
Moylan, 4-3, in the first round.

“We did poorly,” assistant head
coach Rande Stottlemyer said. “I
ﬁgured we’d win quite a few
matches.”

Pitt, as well as the other six
Eastern Wrestling League teams

represented in the tournament,
seemed to tighten up at the event
and thus did poorly, Stottlemyer
said.

“All the hoopla and stuff (me
Iowa State gym held 13,500 fans)
tightened everyone from our
league up," he claimed. “But the
league is good———in the next two
years it'll be dynamite."

Stottlemyer’s attention will now
be turned to next season.

“I’d like to upgrade our
schedule.” he said. “You need
that tough, tough competition like
we saw at the NCAAs.

“I just hope we learned
something at this tournament. We
sawjust how far we have to go to be
goodf’

MAT NOTES: The EWL’s
highest place winner was Clarion’s
heavyweight———.Iack Campbell, who
ﬁnished fourth...Iowa won the
team championship for the fourth
time in five years. The Hawkeyes
finished ahead of second-place
Iowa State by 34.5 points, the
second-highest winning margin in
NCAA history...last year, Pitt

it,” Mathison explained. ,“But, they never followed
through with it, so we got it.”
The Pantherette coach added that the meet should

Pantherette swim coach Kate Mathison checked
the last of the 3,000 entries in the Association of
Intercollegiate Athletics for Women National
Championship that Pitt hosts this week.

“I have to make sure everyone’s listed in the right
events,” said Mathison, the meet director who’s
spent most of the past several weeks looking over
entries, answering the phone andhandling the other
administrative duties that her job entails.

‘Mathison does not mind the fact that she is so

busy. The prestige that Pitt’s swim program figures
to gain by holding such a championship will far
outweight the eye strain she might suffer.
“It’s good for the school,” Mathison said. “We
have one of the best swim facilities in the east. The
only drawback our pool might have is that the diving
boards aren’t separate from the swimming area.”

Mathison is no stranger to championship meets,
having helped organize the women’s Eastern
Regional championship at Pitt in 1976 and several

other large-scale meets that have been held on
campus.

But, she is quick to add, none of those meets were
as big in number of teams and competitor size as this
week's will be.

“It gets to be a headache at times, and I am tired,
but I feel very comfortable doing it (co-directing the
meet),’’ Mathison said. “I'll let you know how I
really feel once the meet is over.”

Championship Notesi - Pitt was not supposed
to host the meet.

“There were a couple sites out west that wanted

have been held in the west because of “logistics.”

“The east has hosted it for the past several years, "

Mathison said. “It was at Brown University in 1977
and at Duke last year. The logistics of the meet say
it should have been in the west.”

° It will not be the first time that Pitt has hosted a
national swim championship. In 1968, Trees Pool
was the site of the Amateur Athletic Union
Championship. The same number of competitors
and teams (approximately 600 and 80. respectively)
that competed in that championship will compete this
week.

' TVS will telcvise this weeks competition, which
will be shown on a tape-delayed basis in nine of the
ten major television markets.

The meet will be televised in Pittsburgh April 21
on WTA l”:L~TV, channel four.

Have an Extra Starting Pitcher? Phillies Want toTrade

By The Associated Press

CLEARWATER, Fla.——Trade
rumors are rampant here as the
Philadelphia Phillies try to acquire
a new pitcher.

The latest news is that if Phillies’
personnel director Paul Owens
can’t make a deal with an American
League club before the end of the
inter-league trading deadline
Thursday, he’ll seriously consider a
trade with San Diego Padres for
lefthander Bob Owchinko.

Another rumor is that the World
Champion New York Yankees
might be interested in sending the
Phillies Ed Figueroa, who posted a
3.57 ERA in 1978.

Yankees’ owner George Stein-
brenner is said to be disenchanted
with Figueroa because of the
righthander’s losses in the past two
years in the playoffs and the World
Series. ’

Word is that the Phils’ talks with
the New York Mets are fading

because the Mets apparently want
to keep their top three pitchers-
Craig Swan, Pat Zachry and Nino
Espinosa.

Philadelphia would like to have
Zachry, but negotiation with the
Mets could be tough.

Meanwhile, a San Francisco
Giant trade rumor isn’t even that
anymore. The Giants, a bona fide
contender in the National League
West, don’t want to tinker with
their top-ﬂight pitching staff.

1 ! POLLWORKER! 2

The Phillies bargaining material
has dwindled down to Richie
Hebner, displaced by Pete Rose at
first base. In a pinch, Owens could
reluctantly toss in utility inﬁelder
Todd Cruz. Hebner, a lifetime .278
hitter, keeps his bags packed.

Owens apparently has taken
outfielder Bake McBride off the
market unless he gets an offer he
can’t refuse. Owens feels he’ll be
able to sign the outfielder at a
reasonable price, even’ though

EARN OVER $650 A MONTH
  RIGHT THROUGH YOUR P

SENIOR YEAR.

If you’re a junior or senior
majoring in sciences like
math, physics or engineering,
the Navy has a program you
should know about.

It’s called the Nuclear
Propulsion Officer Candidate-
Collegiate Program
(NUPOC-C for short) and if
you qualify, you can earn as
much as $650 a month right
through your senior year.
Then after 16 weeks of
Officer Candidate School,
you’ll get an additional year

— of advanced technical
education. This would cost
- thousands in a civilian school,
but in the Navy, we pay you.

It isn’t easy. There are
fewer than 400 openings and
only one of every six
applicants will be selected.
But if you make it, you’ll
have unequaled hands-on

responsibility, at $24,000
salarysin four years, and gilt-
edged qualifications for jobs
both in the Navy and out.
Ask your placement

officer to set up an interview
with a Navy representative
when he visits the campus,
or contact your Navy
representative at 800-841-8000,
or send in the coupon. The
NUPOC-C Program. Not
only can it help you complete
college. It can be the start of

an exciting career.

McBride wants to start contractg

talks at $2 million for five years.
The search for a pitcher is critical
because Larry Christenson suffered
a broken collarbone in a bicycle fall
last month. Manager Danny Ozark
would be satisfied if the right-
hander could return to the lineup

by July.

Philadelphia now has one of the
best defensive teams in baseball.
They have power and speed. But
Ozark would be hard pressed for a
fourth man to join starters Steve
Carlton, Dick Ruthven and Randy
Lerch in the rotation.

Owens says he has heard from
more than a dozen clubs about
Hebner, but none has offered that
first line pitcher the Phillies want.

Owchinko, 24. 6—foot-2, has two
years of major league experience.
He was 8-12 and 10-13 for the
Padres the past two years with a
4.11 lifetime ERA. But he is a top
prospect for stardom.

Pirates Bombard
Cincinnati, 6-1

By T he Assouatctl Pres.

TAMPA, Fla.—Pinch hitter Phil
Garner Drove in three runs with a
seventh inning bases loaded triple
Sunday as Pittsburgh beat Cincin-

4 nati 6-1 in exhibition baseball.

There was no scoring until third
baseman Ray Knight led off the
fifth inning for Cincinnati with an
inﬁeld hit and then scored on a
single to left by Ken Griffey.

Pirate center fielder Omar
Moreno tripled in the tying run in
the sixth and Pittsburgh erupted
for four more runs in the seventh .15
reliever Dave Tomlin walked in the
go-ahead run just before Garner's
shot to the left field wall.

Pittsburgh's ﬁnal run came in
the ninth as Gary Hargis led off
with a double and scored on catcher
Steve Nicosia's triple to center
field.

Tomlin pitched two innings and
took the loss while Ed Whitson, the
third of five pitchers used by
Pittsburgh manager Chuck Tanner.
was credited with the victory.
