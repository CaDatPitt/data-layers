Tyson Seeking
.‘New Sports
Technique’ In
Subsidy Plan

Terming the problem of guiding the
new leisure of the American people
“the outstanding challenge of our
time,” Dr. Francis D. Tyson, professor
of economics, offered proposals VVed-
nesday night for a new technique of
sport.

He spoke to 1,000 delegates at the
ﬁftieth anniversary of the Americ n
Physical Education Association, meet-
ing in the Hotel William Penn,
and appeared on a program
which included Dr. Ben G. Graham,
superintendent of public education,
and 16 child angels from the Pitts-
burgh schools who danced a chorus
number to the music of ll-landels
llLalsg0.9I

“An enlarged accredited system of
educational athletics,” Dr. Tyson said,
“must be prepared for the city of the
future that we are beginning to learn
how to build as we replace our fetid
slums.

“Should we not have Schools of Ath-
letics as well as of education and busi-
ness administration, and give honors
to stn.dents who excel?” he asked.

“Good gravy!” muttered an uniden-
tiﬁed middle-aged woman in the third
row.

Dr. Tyson continued:

“Since we are to have eventually,
professional sports on a larger scale,
let us have professional performers,

college-trained and sponsored, Recent-.

ly you have been developing special
departments for the education of ath-
letes in the theory and pra.ctice of
their profession. Together with phys-
iology, anatomy and biology, the
study of the custom of sport, the sci-
ence of baseball and football and the
art of boxing, the principles of ath-
letics are certainly as educational in
character as accounting, corporation
ﬁnance, secondary education and many
other college subjects.”

Collegiate athletic schedules, at
least as they now exist in football and
basketball, need to be reduced, ,Dr.
Tyson said. He defended shorter
training periods and fewer barns'torn1-
ing trips, citing “the ill-advised post-
season game engaged in by a tired
group of boys with Louisiana at At-
lantic City a week ago,” as an exam-
ple of team weariness.

Relief from this situation. he said.
can be secured by representing the
faculty on university athletic councils.

Attacking the concept of amateur-
ism_ which he called an instance of
.“cultural lag.” -Dr. Tyson asserted:

_“W'h-at we need to do is to bring the
issue out into the open and under the
light of piti.less publicity, and encour-
age the athlete to secure the advant-
ages of higher education-—no\v denied
to him as a son of the working. and
lower salaried classes in the absence
of organized subsidy.

McConkey, B-oyle
Invade Boston

By WINSTON McCONKEY
University Debater
Special Correspondence to The Pitt News

BOSTON, 'M'ass.. April 23.——Travel-
ling up through Coolidge’s and God’s
country, the Peripatetic Pitt Palaver-
ers—-Boyle and Mcconkey, accompan-
ied by Dr. Parrish-have absorbed de-
cisions and New England atmosphere
at Middlebury, Dartmouth and Boston
University. .

So much time-limited argumenta-
tion has aifected them in odd ways.
Easter Sunday’s Mass in Middlebui-y’s
marble Catholic church was very
nearly disturbed by Boyle, who, from
force of habit. stood up when the
Father exceeded 20 minutes.

Dartmouth, Alma Mater of Daniel
Webster and H~erryl'non Maurer, is
distinctive in its contrasts. A tradi-
tion of aristoc-racy decrees that senior
men wear green. blazers, carry Indian-
head canes, and sit on the senior
fence. Yet the Green's traditional de-
mocracy and liberality per, its the
oldest college newspaper in”"_An1erica,
The Daily Dartmouth, to accuse the
school of “mental venereal disease,”
and allows the highly controversial
frescoes of Orozco to remain in Baker
Library.

The library, a dream come true for
browsers, is a place of good books,
comfortable nooks, and afternoon tea
served daily to English majors and
n1ember.~:; of the department by a
liveried and endowed butler.

Pitt debated Dartmouth 011 econo-
mic nationalism to a ﬁnish of two
putouts and a decision. The putouts
were two who were ejected for mak-
ing a. racket in the rear of the hall,
and the decision was awarded to Pitt
by The Daily Dartmouth. Attend-
a.nce at the debate suffered due to the
college players production of “What
Price Glory.”

Hovde Stresses ‘Human’

Relief In Public Relations

“The ability of the public relief ad-
miuis‘i:ration to meet the demands
made upon it by present social condi-
tions depends on the. a.bi.lity of the re-
lief aide to dig down below the sur-
face of a particular situation and yet
see it in relation to the whole public
relief program.”

Dr. B. J. Hovde, associate professor

voiced this conclusion before the

What With Summer Coming On

 

By Leo Koeberlein

‘With the approach of summer and
the end of the school term, Dr. George
S. Kowallis of the Men’s Student
Health service emphasizes that stu-
dents need a “real vacation.”

Those who work during the sum-
mer at hard jobs or at jobs which
keep them out of the sun and do not
give them time for suﬂicient relaxa-
tion, the doctor stresses, cannot build
up enough energy reserve to carry
them through the year.

The warm weather of spring, with-
out the stimulus cold weather carries,

is conducive to sleep and sluggishness,
indicating the strain the student has
undergone fro111 attacks of colds and
other illnesses.

For anyone suffering from that
tired_-out, spring feeling now, Dr. Ko-
wallis gives a few simple rules to fol-
low: take it as easy as you possibly
can, get rest, play a little, do your
work in shorter periods, and sleep
enough hours at night. Above all, try
to plan a vacation in which you can
rest, absorb the ultra-violet rays, and
build up enough energy to carry you
through the year.

‘,men honoring her and Pitt

“It’s In The Blood” He

Says; Georgia. Belle
Gets Festival Bid

By Ron

Next week it will have been exactly
one ‘year since ‘Ellis H. Tuinpson,
BA36, Pitt. l\“eu'.-3 business manager
and r.-l1a.irn1a.n of the Spring Festival
dance, did a bit of touring through
the South for such things  a news-
paper convention and a big horse race
staged by citizens of Kentucky for
foreigners from other states.

The proverbial drawl of the south-
ern women impressed him no end, and
he returned to Pittsburgh. consistent-
ly addicted to saying; “_v’all” when he
meant to say “youse people.”

It has changed the \\.'ll0i13. course of
his life.

As dance chairman it is his duty
and privilege to single. out some likely
young woman and make her dance
queen. _-

I{e’s picked one from Columbus,
Georgia. guaranteed to drop her r’s
where it does» the most good.

Betty Smith, now residing in Mey-
ersdale, will soon have her picture in
The Pitt News  queen of next Sat-
urday night’s danco;2~--Keritucky Derby
night. For the four hours during
which many couples will be dancing
to Austin W)-'lie’s NBC band at the
Hotel Schenley ballroom, Miss Smith
will know what it's like to have Pitt
women
-probably euvying.

But she will lead. no grand march.
There is none scheduled.

‘The Spring Festival dance, for
which apparently hundreds of enthu-
siastic committee. members are
eagerly selling tickets at $2 per cou-
ple, is traditionally dress-optional.

, Dress-optional usually  means .one
‘can wear anything one prefers, has
cleaned. and pressed, or just has. In
the past. sleeveless sweaters have been

true. But white suits and shoes,
sports dresses, semi-formal. gowns,
and most an,vI;hing go, No one has
ever appeared in t'¢:-rural attire, and it
really isn't suggested.

Rather than enumerate where and
with whom tickets are available for
the a1'i'air, it appears much simpler to
‘state that they probably can not be
purchased on the Tecll campus. But
anyone in doubt may bu.y one in the
dean of men's otlice, Room 801, Cathe-
dral.

Maurer Propounds The Issue And Concludes People
Still Shy From Criticizing Society

 

By Herrymon Maurer
HE PIYRITY which the middle class has always espoused deals not ex-
clusively with physical matters. That class has always struggled to keep
its mind sufﬁciently innocent of ethics to be fully prepared for the exigen-
cies of business. To induce a one-track frame of mind, persons of that
class have been obliged to insist upon the supremacy of one thing and one

A N AT least three .stal'es today,

legislative bodies have been
called upon to investigate the
universuies they support. The
universities of Illinois, including
the University of (llxicag(>, will be
investigated for “r:.ullcalis111” by
a. special Senate committee ap-
pouitcd VVcdnesday. The Univer-
sity of Louisville is goitng to be

‘ The Mail

Editor, The Pitt News:

Last Tuesday morning, right after
Easter vacation, I  walking along
the walk leading to the Cathedral of
Learning, Fifth Avenue entrance. I
glanced up because I saw something
white ﬂuttering around the Cathedral
about half way up. I could distin-
guish a huge white banner with black
letters “In The Soup" on it. Evident-
ly, some “wise” student was trying to
put up a sign to advertise the forth-
c’oming Cap and Gown Club show.

After struggling with the sign for
about ﬁve minutes, during which time
quite a crowd had assembled along the
walk, 8,I_l[l Fifth avenue, the student
. gave it up for a. bad job.

their divinity with phrases and slogans. The pursuit of
money by individuals, of course the highest type of
activity in the world, was to bring not only ease and
pleasure to him who pursued it, but very genuine aid,
material and moral, to the community.

So thinly disguised a philosophy of personal acquisi-
tiveness was, of course, highly dangerous. In fact, it
reacted upon many persons in the seventeenth, eight-
eenth, and nineteenth centuries just as strongly as it has

reacted upon almost all persons in the twentieth. The
effect on these individuals was much the same. The
pursuit of money and of position in society was so

strenuous that it demanded" a. positive dislike for any
activity which did not deal with self—advanceIuent.
To these individuals concern for the welfare of others,

 

Maurer

could be only a malicious inﬂuence. ‘Ne look about us

today and we see many, many persons———persons we know, persons who live

on the same city block with us, persons to whom we are related who have
been warped by the philosophy of‘ concern for self. '

Envy And The Pursuit Of Wealth

Today the economic situation is so tense, competition for positions is
so strenuous that self-concern on the part of some persons is almost neces-
sary for survival. But others keep the old aims of wealth and social position
before their eyes. Those who haggle over cents a11d those who haggle over
millions are united in a persistent and desperate chase for new wealth so
that the family next door may envy the new Ford or the new limousine.

To maintain tradition as well as to provide a training which will secure
material happiness for future bourgeois citizens, our civilization has found
it essential to stress the omnipotence of moneyat every opportunity. Home
and school, movies and newspapers impress upon sensitive minds the true
greatness of money, the true nobleness of the pursuit of it. Before an in-
dividual can become conscious of any activities more worthwhile than the
pursuit of wealth he has to become disillusioned with the society that has
stressed self interest.

Human Nature-Greed

But children are not naturally receptive. of disillusion. Unless special
attempts are made to instill it, unless the enormities of exploitation and
greed are stressed, they will lack any critical ability. In fact, those per-
sons we call naive, naive because they accept without thought the dogmas
of church or state, are merely adults lacking in this critical capacity.

Others, whose earliest contacts have been with persons presenting many
of the objectionable features found in human beings, lack critical judgment
as completely as the naive. They labor under the illusion that human na-
ture has forever been based on greed and selﬁshness.

But there are comparatively few adult children; there are comparatively
few supreme Cynics. Critical judgment, used consciously or unconsciously,
comes to most people along with the slightest knowledge of the world in
which they live. But the process or disillusion reacts so strongly upon them
that their minds become as ﬁxed as if cast in a pattern.

Nietzsche And Marx

Certain writers of our own time, for instance, having refused to believe
any longer that the social world is characterized by the simplicity and good-
ness" of the family household, have been unable to realize that the world has
not forever been basically selﬁsh and mean. They have been unable to
realize that even our civilization was for some time unable. to exercise all
of the more human feelings; they overlook the goodness of older persons,
upon whom competition did not operate so drastically, and concentrate upon
the world today.

Perhaps in so doing they do not forget that life in times of transition
is torn by the contradictions of the old civilization whiclr re-acli maximum
intensity. But the education of their whole class has said that the civilization
which their forefathers created is as permanent as man himself. It is +3-.z.sie1'
to be disillusioned with Nietzsche over man than with l\/larx over the society
in which man lives.

The Haven Of Disillusion

Proust, for instance, found it necessary to disillusiou himself: as to the
goodness and simplicity of the people he knew. The whole of his long novel
is a. record of that (lisillusion——a disillusion accompanied by walls rind moans
and shrieks. This in itself was a. terrifying enough process for osc of his
abnormal sensitivity. For him who had undergone this experience to dis-
illusion himself as to his disillusion was impossible. We wonder how  is
that. he stayed alive long enough to set down the story of the applicant of
his own peculiar critical capacity to life in the closing years of capitalistic
civilization.

But most persons are not Prousts. They are sensitive only to a. degree,
and 0111; to a degree are they able to see social and human institutions for
what they are. Criticism in them is a more or less unconscious process; by
their actions and spontaneous expressions of thought they disclose the fact
that they have unknowingly adapted their life to the assumption that self-
interest and greed are the best means to assault the world. If questioned
as to whether life is inherently good they will unhesitatingly say that it is.
So powerful is the tradition that life in general is always essentially noble,
however mean and worthless are one's competitors in business.

The Why Oil‘ Hearst

And when these people hear of someone who would condemn sociefv be-
fore condemning the people who live in it, they, in their righteousness 'pray
for the time he will be safely in prison. They prefer the philosophy of
Hearst, for they are too hypocritical to accept the frank ideas of Neitzche.

Before the turn of the century many people were still able to be human
and yet pursue wealth. Today no such division of energy is possible.

Are we also to become warped?

Panthers Face Starting Gun
At Penn Relay Races Today

 

Olson Enters 16 In Forty-ﬁrst Running Of Carnival; Mile
Relay Team To Defend Class B Title

 

Headed by their crack mile-relay team, Coach Cari Ols‘on’s
trackmen were ,.in Philadelphia. this morning awaiting the start of
the nation ’s outstanding relay carnival, the .t‘ort.y-ﬁrst. running of the

Penn Relays.

Sixteen athletes were in the party that left Pittsburgh yesterday

morning for the Quaker City.

The ﬁrst event on the program for the Pantlicrs is the four-mile

relay, which will be run oﬁ late this
.=11'ternoon. Coach Olson plans to use

.l{.irkpatrick, W'agenhouser, Tost and
Musico in this event. Competing
against the Pitt quartet. will be most
of the leading teams of the east, led
by Pennsylvania. Gene Venzke, na-
tionally known miler, will hold down
the anchor post for the Penn entry.

Shortly after the running of the dis-
tance relay, the Panther runners will
go into action in the sprint medley
event. The Blue and Gold outﬁt for
this feature will be made up by Kiger,
Lasky, Fleming, and G1-oat. The lead
man will run a of-.1arter-mile, the next
two baton—passe-rs will each do 220
-yards, and the anchor man will ﬁnish
up with a half-mile jaunt.

Columbia and Manhattan are the
pro-race favorites. The Lions, hold-
ing down the pole position at the
start, will use their two star dash-
men, Maniaci and Johnson, for the

wo sprint lengths.
Mile-Relayers Hope To Repeat

Saturday afternoon, the mi1e-rela.y-
ers swing into action with their Class
1-3 title at stake. Winrlers of this
event in the last two carnivals, the
Panther quartet is hopeful of making‘
it three straight. The same group
of quarter-milers which broke records
at the Central Intercollegiate and Ar-
mour Tech events during the winter
will form the team. Those are Cap-
tain Fred Kiger, Bud (_-lroat, Emmet
1IcDonald, and Harold Connelly.

With the exception of Groat, this
quartet is the same one that came
within a fraction of a. second from
setting a new mark in last year's
event". This will be Kiger’s and Mc-
Donald's last chance to run in the
relays, as both men are seniors.

Coach Olson may enter his crack
foursome in both Class A and B mile-
"relay events, depending on the boys’
showing in their first run. Kiger &
Company would like nothing better
zhan to even up old scores with Holy
Cross and Ma.nhatt.an, the two teams
handing out defeats t.o the Panthers
in one of the winter meetings.

In addition to the varsity relay
events, several Pitt men will be enter-
ed in the individual contests. Arvel
’l<".eming will participate in both the
100-meter dash and the running broad
jump. Gene Taano, who broke the
.~:.i’:adiun1 javelin record last Saturday,
will compete in his favorite event.
liither Pelucha or Johnson will be
used in the pole vault.

Coach Pott’s freshmen runners will
he entered in one event, the mile-
relay. The team will be composed
nf Thomas, McConnell, Pustik, and
Van Kennan.

Phys Eds Complete Plans
For Playday On May 18

 

 

Between conventions. institutes and
playdays the Phys Ed majors are be-
ing kept quite busy. Although the
«late set aside for the “Muscle Build-
.--rs’ Jubilee” is three weeks away, the
committee has completed nearly all
details for the affair.

The program will begin at 7:30
o'clock on May 18, when the play com-
mittee directs an hour's entertain-
ment of games, relays, and stunts in
the gymnasium.

At the gymnasium the group will
have a swimming party, the commit-
fee for which has planned a series of
events and a diving exhibition for en-
tertainment.

After the swim, _the main show of
the program, a dance, will get under
way in the gymnasium. The dance
will begin at 9 and last until 12
o’clock.

Corr Prepares For Third
Annual Swimming Clinic

-._.—

Now that the competitive swimming
season is over, Varsity Coach Patrick
.T. Corr has begun plans for the third
annual University swimming clinic.

The purpose of the clinic this year
is to have as many phases of the sport

tative program has been arranged
which calls for short discussions on:
history and records, sanitation and
pools, recreational water sports, life
saving, women's swimming, water
pageants. officials, and report on the
national AAU meet.

Invitations are being sent out to all
swimming clubs, high schools, and

Two Victories
Give Phi Dells
Frat Loop Lead

 

Phi Delta Theta took two games in
as many days to capture the lead in
league “C” of the lnterfraternity
mushball tourney.

Tuesday's game on the Schenley
oval ﬁeld was the closest one of tour-
ney play thus far. Behind the live-
hit pitching of Brandt, North Dith-
1-idge speed-ball artist, the Phi Delt's
topped Delta Tau Delta, 5-4. Davis
was touched for six hits, two of
which came from the bat of Sam An-
derson. Phi Delt slugger.

Delta Tau Delta led, 4-2, up to the
last half of the sixth at which point
the Phi Delts knotted the count.
Brandt. set the batters down 1-2-3 in
the Deli half of the seventh and ﬁnal
frame. His Inates pushed the win-
ning run across the plate in their last
regular turn at bat. Anderson scored
the winning run on Hoel's double to
center.

In a i‘ree-hitting game, the Phi
Belts trounced Theta Chi, 22-12, on
Monday. Hoel had a peri:'e.ct day at
bat, SOClilll§-._'.‘ out a. home run, a double,
and three singles in ﬁve trips to the
plate. Andrews collected three out
of four for the losers. Anderson also
hit freely, connecting for four blows in
.tive times at bat,

'Carnahan, pitching for the Phi Delis,
and Theta Chi Dannels were hit hard
and often during the seven-inning
struggle. The game featured the
most murderous assault on Greek
pitchers this season,

Phi Gamma Delta rallied in the
sixth inning to score three runs and
nose out Theta. Chi, 14-13. Bricker
of Theta Chi and‘Fiji'VVatson each
got four hits out of five times at bat.

Women To Vie For Honors
In Festival Sport Events

60 To Participate
In Giant Carnival,
-Circus Thursday

Each Class To Have Own Color;
Will Enter 12 For Mushball,
20 For Novelty Races

 

 

Amid the atmosphere of a seven-
ring circus, ‘Unive;-rsity women will go
through their paces Thursday after-
noon at the Stadium when the wom-
en’s classes vie with each other for
honors in handicap races, badminton,
tennis, throws, jacks, darts, bean
bags, and hop scotch.

It is all a part of the giant carnival
of Spring Festival week, which will
also include men’s events, booths, and
other circus paraphernalia. About 60
or more women from each class will
participate in the women’s events.

At 2:30 o’clock the women’s events
get under way with two mushball
games running at once. A drawing
will be held to determine the posi-
tions of the tea.ms and each team will
be given a color, which will be used
by that class all afternoon. Each
class will enter 12 women in this
event. The winners of the ﬁrst
bracket will not play each other until
4:30 o'clock, to allow time for the
other events to be run off and the
mushball players to regain their wind.
A cup will be awarded the winning
team of the second and last match.

Ten novelty races will compose the
handicap races, which wili start at
3:30 o’clock, For this event 20 women
from each class may sign up. In the
same hour the volley ball games, in
which eight women from each class
may be entered, will be going on, as
will the other events. For the re-
maining events, jacks, hop scotch,
bean bags, deck tennis, darts, badmin-
ton, basketball and baseball throws,
each class will be represented by two
women.

The winner of the sports events will
be determined by the class which to-
tals the highest number of points dur-
ing the afternoon’s aitray.

Co-chairmen of the women’s sports
events are Frances Dent, Ed35, and
Marion Epping, BA35, under whom is
working Carol Bankson, Ed37, chair-
man of equipment. -

Coed Swimmers
Enter WAA Meet

Interclass Swimming Champions
Will Be Decided May 6

‘With Spring Festival plans on their
minds, University women have neg-
lected to sign up for the \WAA-spon-

‘sored interclass swimming meet May

6 and 13, according to Jane Booth,
Ed36_ general chairman.

“There are very few students
signed up for the meet,” Miss Booth
said, “and these are physical educa-
tion majors. Tlie majority of stu-
dents thinl: the meet is for the ‘ed’
majors, but it isn’t. It is sponsored
by VVAA for University women who
like to swim and who are willing to
enter so that the best swimmers will
represent their class.”

As an added inducement, Miss
Booth said, “it has always been the
custom for the losing teams to fete
the winners. This Year the D1‘i7-9
will probably be a luncheon.”

Prospective aquatic stars may sign
up for the meet at the WAA bulletin
boards in the gym and Alumni hall,
where the events are listed. Aside
from individual swimming, there will
be medleys, relays, obstacle races,
and diving events.

Entrants may practice up on their
crawls, back and breast strokes at the
gym during WAA practice hours, from
4:15 to 5 o'clock on Monday, Tuesday
and Wednesday.
