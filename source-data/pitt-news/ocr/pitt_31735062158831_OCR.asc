Perhaps we can now explain
why Dorothy Thompson in her
column bemoans the alleged at-
tempts of the President to seize
the government of the United
States._ She must have developed ’
this old-maid attitude of looking
under the bed for dictators since
she and Sinclair Lewis have part-
ed.

The President, however, on his
way to Seattle remarks: “It’s a
better country for having spent
in the last ﬁve years more than
we took in in taxes.” Yes, for the

Freshmen Plan
Trip To Came

Determined to supplement the
past week’s program of assemblies,
dinners, camp, and classes, a
group of freshman men is making
tentative plans to travel to Mor-
gantown next Saturday, October 2,
to see the Pitt-West Virginia
game.

By chartering a bus, the ﬁrst-
year men ﬁgure to make the round
trip at $1.65 per man.

“Whether we can make the trip
or not,” declared Rudy Aldisert,
C41, chairman of the enteruprise,
“depends whether the bus capac-
ity of 35 will have signed up Mon-
day, September 27.”

Final registration must be made

First Alumni Review
Appears On Campus

Monthly

Magazine Inaugurates

Series By University Deans

Featuring an article by Dr. St.a11t.o11 C. Crawford, dean. of
the College, on “The College and the Student,” the Alumni Re-
view, official publication of the General Alumni Association,
makes its appearance on campus today.

The kind of graduate idealized by The College, Dr. Craw-

ford declares may well
our attention at the outset, be-
cause in him we see the ideal stu-
dent after he has grown to full
stature.

He writes that the College is
concerned with the student rather
the subject matter
which he studies, and is interest-
ed in turning out well-rounded
individuals.

FIRST OF SERIES

Dr. Crawford’s articles is the
ﬁrst in a series of articles for the
Alumni Review explaining pro-
grams of individual schools and
how they carry out thz aims of the
University. Succeeding articles
will be written by other deans.

The frontispiece of the Review
is an aerial View of the Cathedral,
showing also the Foster Memor-
ial, Heinz Memorial, and the Mel-
lon Institute.

This issue contains special fea-
ture articles on Andrew W. Mel-
len, Dr. John Jenkins Buchanan,
and Dr. John W. W. Hallock. It
presents the life stories and ac-
complishments of these distin-
guished alumni of the University
whose deaths occurred this past
summer.

Brilliant futures are predicted
for Daddio, Hoffman, Souchak,
Goldberg, Urban, Stebbins, Pat-
rick, and Stapulis in an article on
the Panther’s prospects for the
1937 season. But although Dr.
Sutherland’s views are a bit pes-
simistic, he does say, “We should
have a good season.”

Don F. Saunders, C29, former
editor of The Pittsburgh Record,
is editor of the Review, with Wil-
liam Allison, C33, the new manag-
ing editor.

‘V111 Discuss

Wagner _j;:‘Act

Beg-inning its ;:*egular series
of Monday ses ions, Inquiry
Forum meets t  ay at 12 :30
o’clock in 24 Ca iedral to hear
Robert Kleeb, at iorney for the
regional office of tge National La-
bor Relations Boa , discuss “The
E Future of the Wa er Act.”

Acting as couns ,3 for the NLRB
since the adminis

ation of the
Wagner act began Mr. Kleeb has
had wide experien e in cases aris-
ing under its proxsions.

With the NLRB§icalled upon to
settle not only d_ putes between
capital and labor; but also dis-
putes resulting ftom the CIO—
AF-L squabble, the administra-
tive board’s position has been a
most unusual one. Because of his
experience in working under the
NLRB, Mr. Kleeb’s interpretation
may help to clarify‘ the confused

 

labor situation.
Continuing the plan followed in
former years, regular Monday

meetings of Inquiry Forum will
follow the question period proce-
dure. During the ﬁrst half hour,
the speaker will address the
group; in the second half of the
program, students will question
the speaker from the ﬂoor.

this year are John Martinco, C39,
and Ida Gigliotti, C39.

[be accounted for by chairmen
§Schultz and McKenna, who said,
?“The cheering section, which was
a huge success last season, was en-
larged in expectation of an even
greater popularity this year. The
poor registration results probably
is due to a general misunderstand-

Any student at the University
who possesses _an athletic book is
eligible for the block. Probably
only one rehearsal will be held,
this scheduled for» Thursday of
this week, before the Duquesne

""Turned'I'nto Exhibits for (Our Amusement.‘

Today I saw the monkeys at the zoo

lieliind protective bars to. keep them from

the g‘reat‘and‘hostile world. I saw them do

the things that make one wonder if they’re dumb
and live by force of habit, or, instead,

are brighter than we think. One chubby ape,
depended by his tail, inclined his head

and at the gaping crowd began to gape.

Iglhéiyoungsters -and the oldsters watched with glee

and laughed aloud to see the monkey act;
a._ moppet, with the gift of mimicry,
made ‘monkey-faces_ while ‘_forg'etting‘_ta.c_t.

THE PITT NEWS

I I       by;-uttencutter

The first column of Pittpouriffailed’ to disclose
probably the most promisiiigromantic story of the
summer, between Torn (Panther) Smith, and a
Wisconsin campus beauty. Pittpouri writers, who
have formerly linked the dapper editor’s name with
strike-publicity Matveak, should knbw that the
combination is now Smith-Marjory Pollock—blond,
beautiful, and 19 of Madison.

It was a fan mail romance. Smith, who saw
her picture last fall in the Octupus, Wisconsin’s
comic mag, promptly wrote a letter westward
asking for more details. And pretty sophomore
Pollclck, eviasntiy pleased with her Pitt fan,
started a correspondence which culminated last
fall in an invitation from her to c’m up and visit
awhile. ’

Smith borrowed his dad’s railroad pass and com-
pletely convinced himself that Greeley was right.
Interviewed just before Panther press time, Smith,
obviously still in a wheat ﬁeld, had this to say,
“Love has been underrated.”

No Holidays, Vacations . . .

Possibly the only man to work 377 days a year
is pleasant Negro Charlie “Doc” King, School of
Medicine janitor. Since years usually average only
365 days, Charlie credits himself with quite a bit
of overtime.
works every day in the year, Sunday’s and holi-
days included, and relieves the night watchman at
the Med school one night a month.

He has worked his estimated 377 days a year
since 1921, with only ﬁve days off during those
15 years, because of measles.‘ In that time,
short, white capped Charlie King has become
almost as famous a part of the school as the ﬁve
to six hundred bodies that ﬂoat silently in the
third ﬂoor dissecting labs. ~

Smiling “Doc” King knows all about those
bodies. Once when he was relieving the night
watchman, Charlie went to the cold, quiet dis-
secting lab to punch a time clock.

Just as he passed a vat full of delayed burials,
the breeze from an open window rattled a sheet
of paper on the floor. Charlie exited like a rush
call ambulance through the moonlight. Later,
an ‘-ADT inspector found him at home still shiv-
ering.

Charlie had a short run. He lives around the
corner (2825 Berthourd St.) with his wife, three
children. and Mrs. Kings great grandmother. The
aged grandmother plainly recalls Sherman’s bloody

ing in a sugar cane mill near Macon.

Besides cleaning up the school building, Charlie
drives a ’30 Ford on daily trips to six or more hos-
pitals, collecting unusual operation specimens for
student observation. Since 1921, Charlie has worn
out two Model T’s making the daily collections.
Raising dogs for laboratory purposes is another
King duty. He breed.s them constantly, so that 60
dogs, at least 15 months old, are always available
for classes.

Hyper-Thesis
Today I heard a lecture on the origin of sound
and its consequent conclusion as spoken and writ-
presented by
are the bow-
the heigh-de-

ten speech.‘ Among the theories

speech scholars, my prof declared,
wow, the ding,dong, and, I believe,
ho hypothesis.

And all this is very signiﬁcant, my prof added
signiﬁcantly. “But,” he said, parrying a bit, “al-
though these theories were propounded by lin-
guisticscholars, one can never be sure.”

To be sure, one cannot.

Therefore, why not theorize a bit on our own?
This is a rhetorkical question.

VVe offer additively to the ahlf-dozen or so
theories one of our own, which, for the sake of
continuity, we shall call the “glcep-gleep” theory.

Briefly, we base our hypothesis on the clouds.
In the beginning of all sorts ‘of things that we

of which possessed distinct characteristics, or,
physically, diversiﬁed sound waves.

At times, whether needed or not, rain fell upon
prehistoric man. But, you follow me, I believe, the
rain drops originated from clouds of varying den-
sities. Through a hypersensitivity and supercon-
tact with their source, the drops would carry with
them the representations of the latent sound wave
of their maternal cloud.

As the rain fell, droplets would drop helter-
skelter in bewildering style. Many of them would
land submissively on the predominant cars of
pithecanthropus erectus or pronus of the Java ape
man. As the drops landed, each would emit a
sound identical to that contained in the cloud from
which they came.

Fascinated, our lumbering ancestor ‘:cmembc-re-cl
the sound. In the passing of future days, he would
burble (rather inanely to modern sophisticates)
“Gleep-gleep.” And thus would "'g‘leep—gleep" be
forever associated with him. Were he amorous,
“gleep” would mean amorous.

A fellow member of his tribe might receive
contact with a. “brok” cloud. or a “sP1'ex” cloud,
or a “symph” cloud. Thus, through association,
“brok” would mean “ana.emic;” “sprex” would
signify “sissiﬁed;” “symph” would imply “innoc-
uous.” And so it goes.

At present the forms of this language are best
preserved by linguistic scholars. Which may
mean something.

What
hangs over

 

-—— By‘ Clarence Wible

A year or so ago Ben Hecht and
Charlie McArthur co—laborat«ed
on on a bit of namby-pamby clap-
trap entitled “The Scoundrels.”
Starring Noel Coward, it was pro-
duced by the bad mad boys of
Hollywood as the last word in
silken sophistication. The movie-
goers ate it up.

The movie—going public was
duped into believing that
were seeing the real stuff, hot
from the brain trusts of culture.
What they really saw was a clev-
erly produced picture, stinking out
loud of pseudo-sophistication, its
deﬁciencies glossed over with a
false halo of intellectuality.

And as usual, the boys of Holly-

Iwood said, a la Texas Guinan,
j “Hello, slicker.”
' The reaction" to “The Scoundrel”
lwas inevitable. Stage quoted one
l young girl as saying of Noel Cow-
; ard in the leading role, “Gee, ain’t
she sophisticated!” Noel didn’t dis-
lappoint them. He was in there
lpitching all the time, his thin pa-
trician lips twisted into a polite
400 sneer, biting out crisp shallow
epigrams, one after another. It
was awful and the movie moguls
knew it. But the point is, they
knew their public.

Times and the I. Q. of the pub-
lic have changed for the better.
The movie-goers want good pic-
tures. They understand adult pic-
tures, and it was inevitable that
the Hollywood producers, who are
ever appreciative of the public’s
cultural temperature, would rec-
ognize this new trend.

"The result has been a succes-
sion of pictures that has the critics
, standing on their respective heads
singing loud paeans of praise to
the boys in Hollywood, no longer
bad or mad.

Not only conﬁning their activi-
ties to the screen gloriﬁcation of
the classics and the biographies of
great men, the producers have
themselves hopped on the crusade
; band-wagon.

L Witness such productions as
: “Black Fury,” “The Black Le-
 gion,” “Dead End,” and the more
gsensational “Damaged Lives.”
 European productions have been
lmade available to the movie-
gfans, and such outstanding suc-
lcesses as “La Maternelle” and
“The 39 Steps” have reached the
gattention of the newly aroused
l public.

I There is no reason why the

good work should not keep up.

Joe Fan likes and understands
 the more serious and adult movies.
l Hollywood h a s convincingly
;proved that it is capable of pro-
fducing them. The critics are
lhappy.
j The intellectual awareness of
lthe movie-public has at last as-
!-serted itself and we must agree
{with Harold Cohen of the Post-
: Gazette that: “We should be proud
.3 to live in an age that is capable of
} producing a picture like “The
7 Good Earth.”

Dr. B.alifu:ins.Hist0ry Ccizitdins
Colorful Tale Of District

“About the year 1750 the

The Story of a City..” Biit the
Press is much more than just a tale
of the hills that tower bleakly
above the valley with their streets,
buildings, industries and environs
that are known as “Pittsburgh.”

It is a book which, while lack-
ing the oft-times factual barrage
of most of our history manuals, is
ﬁlled with word pictures of all
the color and much of the drabness
that has passed on in the vicinity
of the junction of the Allegheny
and Monongahela Rivers since
1750. 1

CITY PORTRAYAL

From its birth in the primative

savagery of frontier life, when
two warring white nations pitted
the blood—loving Indian against
each other while seeking to control
the territory, up through a period
of awkward adolescence to the
manhood of a modern industrial
'giant——Pittsburgh is portrayed in
lall its stages by Dr. Baldwin.
I But much more important to the
‘reader than such material in a
cold sequence of events could be,
is the book’s swinging style that
carries the tale from decade to
decade, picturing as it goes the
men who have had a hand-—-or a
life—in the making‘ of the city of
today.

To the Pittsburgher of 1937 it
is an interesting experience to read
the city’s trials, its growing pains,
in the light which rightly gives it
the importance which it deserves
rather than a usual matter-of—fact
acceptance of its varied activities,

its cultural heritage, and its his-

The Story
° Of A City

scarce-dispelled clouds of war

between Great Britainand France began once more to lower,
and it became apparent to the thin line of merchants and farm-
ers along the Atlantic seaboard that the two nations would
soon engage 111 a struggle for control of the Ohio Vallev . . .”'

_ Thus begins the book which its author, Dr. Leland D. Bald-
win of the department of history, calls merely “Pitrt.sb11rgh-—

latest volume off the University
torical saints.

PIKE-CIVIL WAR

Dr. Baldwin has dealt primar-
ily with the period up until the
Civil War, devoting 326 of its 366
pages of material to pre-1860
events because, says the author,
it is almost impossible to evaluate

more recent events in their places 1*

in Pittsburgh’s progress as ac-
curately as can be done with
those of the more distant past.

But this even for ‘those who
would wish an evaluation of cur-
rent Pittsburgh, is of on great mo-
ment. The picture is in relief and
can be seen in brief clarity.

For the Pittsburgh of the fu-2
hazards E

ture, Dr. Baldwin also
some predictions

“Pittsburgh, perhaps to a great-
er extent than any other urban
center in the country, is still in
the making, is still to attain the
full maturity of its powers. It
stands enthralled upon the thres-
hold of a great adventure——View-
ing "through the doorway to the
future an intelectual and material
empire such as few other cities
have the faith or the opportunity
to behold.

“Unsophisticated it may be in
some ways, crude, perhaps, in
others, yet Pittsburgh possesses
above all else a youthful fresh-

ness and vigor, a magniﬁcent out-
look on ife that can be compared
only to the Elizabethan wonders
that makes sixteenth century Eng-
land the delight of a blase modern
world.”

Win War,’

Says Lyman Hoover
Before Inquiry Forum

By Robert Brown
(‘hina will win the present undeclared war raging between
herself and Japan because she possesses cultural and spiritual
forces among her people greater than those of the younger na-
tioii. Such is the opinion of Lyman Hoover, student secretarv
of the Peiping IMCA, who spoke at the Friday meeting of In-

i\li'. Hoover pointed out that this “ne 1' spiritual force” is
almost a direct: result of the Periodic Japanese invasions that

soil for the past 20 years.

“China, helped by the powerful
Nanking government and the
Shanghai banks, has undergone
fast and fa-ir-reacliing improve-
ments,” he said. “New roads,
schools, and irrigation systems
have brought about a uniﬁcation
that had never been felt before.
As a result, the Chinese have
turned as one man to. head off" the
latest Japanese onthrust which
threatens to destroy their recent
improvements. It will be difficult
for the Japanese armies and their
leaders to destroy this feeling.”

CHINA ILL EQUIPPED

, From a military standpoint, Mr.
Hoover indicated that the Chinese‘
were ill—equipped to carry on the,
war. With the munitions factor-
ies going full blast, only 800,000
rounds of ammunition can be
turned out daily. It is also diffi-
cult to get this ammunition to the
troops. Even. with their greater
man power, then, the Chinese can-
not hope to put up effective re-
sistance against. the superior
weapons and the ﬁghting equip-
nient of the Japanese.

Some oneraised the question as
to. whether itxwould. not be better
for Japan to conquer China in or-
der that she might bring more
eﬁiciency and reform into the
older country. , .

NOT SUFFICIENT WORK
- “From observations that havel
been made in countries and terri-l
tories under Japan’c control, this
would not work,” stated the
speaker. “For example, in Korea,
the young‘ Japanese who cannot
get sufﬁcient work in their home
country are now employed in
most of the responsible positions,
while it is ‘very difﬁcult for 21 K0-
rean to secure any of the higher
§jObS.

. “This is also the case in Man-
churia, where most of the edu-’
~catecl inhabitants have left because
of the scarcity of good positions,
which are being taken by the Jap-
anese. There is no reason to sup-
pose that this would not be the;
case in China, were Japan. to getl
control there.” 
It remains to be seen how thel
morale of the Chinese people will!
stand up if and when the twof
strategic positions‘ of Shanghai and
Nanking are taken, for the coun-
try strongly appreciates the. im-l,

have been launched on Chinese?’

portance of these cities, Mr.
Hoover said. The government will
be forced to retreat farther up the
river, and eventually back to the
provinces. A “real weakness”
would result.

Mr. Hoover believes that the
ﬁght the Chinese are putting up
is their last resort to the Japanese
raids of the past years. Formerly,
China put  with these invasions,
merely calling their attention to
the World Court. However, the
Chinese now feel that Japan will
keep this policy of theirs in force,

and the only alternative is to fight.

Campus I Opinion

News Poll Begins Today

In an attempt to elicit from

I the _University student body an

iopinion on the matter of coin-
'mercialized athletics in Amer-
ican colleges and universities,
student interviewers of “Campus
Opinion,” Pitt News student poll
will be approaching all and sundry
in the Cathedral corridors today
and tomorrow.

Based on a current magazine ar-
ticle in which the outlook for the
present football season is present-
,ed and the question of comrner—
lcialism discussed, the poll, in
{questionnaire form, will contain
lthe following queries:

 1. Do you in general favor
j. the practice of most universi-
ties of extending to good high
school football players extra.
inducements in the form of
scholarships, exemptions, “jobs”
etc., in order to persuade them
to attend that particular school?

2. Do you believe athletes
: should be paid outright salar-
' ies?
l 3.

Do you believe that a sys-
tematic exploitation of football
} at any given university neces-
sarily hampers the develop-
ment» of, and interest in, a com-
, prehensive recreational pro-
gram at that institution?

4. Do you believe that inter-
est in college football would be
as great among the st-utlents if it
were kept on a strictly amateur
(without organized proselyting
or subsidizing) basis?

5. Do you believe that inter-
est in college football would be
as great among outsiders if it
were kept on a strictly amateur
(as deﬁned above) basis?

6. Do you think college foot-
ball machines should be main-
, tained with an eye to the gate
‘ receipts?

Results of the first poll will
be published in Friday’s edition
of the Pitt News.

Panthers Crush Bishops,
Don’t Look Too Good

Cassiano Leads
Pitt To 59-0.  
Triumpii

By LEONARD LEVISO-N
Sports Editor

PiItt's proud Panthers pol-
ished their national gridiron
championship emblems Satur-
day at the Stadium by dusting
of the Battling Bishops of
Ohio Wesleyan with a perform-
ance that fairly shines in the
scoreboard ﬁgures of 59-0. But,
all that glitters is not football
gold.

Using only a chorus girl’s por-
tion of the wholesome diet of play
strategems Dr. Sutherland has
provided for their nourishment,
the Panthers helped themselves to
two touchdowns each period ex-
cept the final one, when they made
three. Some of these six-point-
ers they just grabbed out of the
air.

More than anithing else this
game seemed to justify Jock Suth-- E
erland's pre—season apprehen--‘I
sions. The Pitt coach has claim-
ed that because of a feeling of

over—conﬁdence, his varsity is 75
per cent up to the playing place;
it was at the same time last sea-;
son. Rival scouts, having seen];
both openers, agreed in their Sun- 
day reports that the good doctor;
was not talking through his head— 1,
gear. 
CARELESS PLAY 

General carelessness was the:
chief characteristic of the startingl
team’s conduct on the ﬁeld. Thei
line provided ineffectual block-;
ing, backs were unsteady in their;

handling of the ball, and general-j

need much time to accomplish the
ﬁnest piece of oifensive cannon.ad-

Taking hold of the ball for its
first advance endeavor, Ohio Wes-
leyan dared to pass and pass
deeply. Pat Brookes, the Bishop
triple threater, went into throw-
ing formation and tossed a high,
arching forward.

Playing in a safety position,
Goldberg snatched the ball in
midﬁeld from amidst a Bishop re-
ceiving delegation. Then, without,

Panther Coach
Needs More
Hill And Dalers

With already over one hundred
track candidates to take care of,
Carl Olson, varsity track coach, is

V working on plans for his sixth an-

nual novice track, tourney and in
between times he takes time out
to worry a, few hairs white over
an inexperienced cross country
team. ,

This schedule of work and wor-
ry would -be enough to crush most
coaches, but not the genial Olson.
He has issued a call for more can-
didates and will welcome any can-
didate, whether a former high
school star or merely a champion
train chaser. Olson looks upon
the number out for the cinder
sport as a good omen if numbers
mean anything. He has more can-
didates out now than he has ever
had out for track at such an early
date.

The entries for the novice track
event have been coming in all this
week. but not fast enough for O1-
son. The tourney is to be run off
November 20 and 22. Anyone not
a track letterman is eligible to
run in the event.

Among those entered are Theo-
dore Stanish in the sprints, Clif
Carlson and Charles Schroeder in
the weights, Lawrence Katz in
the quarter mile, Albert Boul-
agner in the half mile, and Wil-
liam lnurmi in the mile.

And then there is the matter of
cross country to plague Olson.

vWith Al Zamborski the only re-

turning varsity runner, Olson will
bank on two juniors, Ben and
Casimir- Kopec, whose only cross
country experience was acquired
on the junio varsity‘ hill and dale,
squad last year. However, they
have shown great improvement
over last year’s form in the early
workouts this season.

Besides Zamborski and the K0-
pec brothers Olson has several
other runners who should gather
in a few points for the Panthers.

About 50 candidates for the
junior varsity football team will
meet today at 2:30 up at the track
house, pour themselves into regu-
lation uniforms, and start the bat-
tle for the eleven starting posts.

The junior football varsity, a
new phase of the University’s in-
tra-mural program, is open to all
sophomores, juniors, and seniors
who feel the urge to block a punt
or crack open a line, and is a re-
quisite for physical education ma-
jors, not yet out for any sport.

Coach Harvey Rooker, the vol-
unteer Tarentum Fireman, who
played a heap of end for the
Panthers eleven in ’32, ’33, and
’34, feels that the junior varsity
will give many boys who desire to
play football and yet cannot make
the varsity through lack of size or
ability, an opportunity to per-
form on the gridiron.

Harvey Rooker, crack varsity end
of a few years back. Rooker suc-

Following his graduation
Rooker aided Mike Milligan,
freshman football mentor, during
the ’35 and ’36 seasons. ‘

As director of intramural sports
he intends to add a new feature
here and there and do away with
one or two sports found not so
desirable in the setup. Continu-
ing Feely’s policy of “something
doing all the time” Rooker prom-
ises to present a program that
will keep the ball rolling continu-
ously.

In addition to his regular du-
ties as intramural head, Rooker
has organized a junior Varsity
squad. The Athletic Department’s
choice to ﬁll Feely’s shoes will
deﬁnitely prove a popular one.

His stay at Conemaugh ﬁrmly
entrenched him as an “all right
guy” with the students. And on
the campus as an undergraduate
he was extremely popular. On
the playing ﬁeld he was eclipsed
only by the great Muggsy Sklad—
any, one of Pitt’s ﬂnest ends, and
also his running mate.

Rooker stands somewhere over

pounds. He is very affable and
is already a favorite of the gym
class students. His greatest asset
next to his knack of imparting
football and basketball funda-
mentals is his ability to get along
with the boys.

Rooker promises to be one of
the best liked men on the campus
and no doubt will set new highs
as head of intramural sports.

As John Dambach, head of the
physical education department,
said, “Rooker is one of the ﬁnest
teachers that has come out of this
department in the past few
years.”

Academic Bricklayers?

UR-ING the course of a conversation concerning the value of

an Evening School to its students, the remark was made that
most evening students are just like a lot of bricklayers. They
are interested only in the haphazard piling up of academic
bricks-credits.

Unfortunately, this remark contains some elements of truth.
There are students in the Evening Division who will admit
frankly that they want a degree merely to fatten their pay
check. Others, with equal frankness, say that they take courses
only because a school superintendent forces them to obtain a
degree. Still others, victims of tragedy or disappointment, en-
ter classes to forget their griefs and worries by making new so-
cial contacts. A few want only to be entertained. They look
upon the classroom as a specialized kind of theatre. The pro-
fessor, they believe, should be a master of ceremonies. His lec-
tures should have the histrionic versatility of an Alfred Lunt or

the comic antics of a Joe Penner.
BUT WE believe sincerely that the majority of students enter

Pitt Evening Division because they see in it an opportunity
for themselves to grow mentally a.nd spiritually. They realize
that the mere" amassing of credits is no guarantee that they are
educated men and women. They are quick to see that no group
of professors can ever give them an education in return for the
money they have paid at the Treasurer’s Oﬂice. They would
agree with Everett Dean Martin that “There can be no quantity
production of the things of the spirit.”

To those students who are entering the Pitt Evening Divi-
sion for the ﬁrst time this semester, we Wish to extend greetings.
Whatever may be the reason which has prompted you to enroll
in evening classes, we hope that as you continue your studies
you will acquire an intellectual curiosity which will lead you to
go ever deeper i11to those ﬁelds of study which you have chosen.
The enthusiasm of your professor, the zeal of your classmates,
and your own excitement over the new realms which you are
exploring should stimulate you in your search for truth.

Evening News

Seeks Members

Through graduations and with-
drawals from the Evening School
Division, the staff of the Pitt Eve-
ning School News is depleted this
year. An effort is being made to
attract interested students. Any
student who has completed eight
credits of University work with
an academic average of “C” is eli-
gible for membership to the staff.

The Evening Sessions News will

meet Thursday evening, October,

7, in the ofﬁce of Mr. Mahony, ‘di-
rector of the Evening School, after
the second hour classes, 9:35 p. m.
Anyone interested in writing for

trations, a 28 per cent gain over
last year. Afternoon, evening, and
Saturday classes‘ recorded an 11
per cent‘ increase over last year’s
total of 2119.

Freshman classes in the. Schools
of Engineering and Mines, ﬁlled
to capacity, have increased 12 per
cent over last year, and those in
the School of Business Adminis-
tration are up 11 per cent.

Novel features of this year’s
registration included use of the
Commons Room for the ﬁrst time,
to the accompaniment of organ
music played at half-hour inter-
vals by Dr. J. S. Oartel, assistant
professor of histology and bac-
teriology in the School of Dentis-
try. Refreshments were served
by aides directed by Elizabeth
Rearick, assistant professor of
physical education, in 108 Cathe-
dral, converted into a reception
room during the registration pe-
riod.

Members of the faculty and reg-
istrar’s staff moved last week into
condensed quarters occupying half
of the Commons Room in order to
‘register Evening Division students.
Students who found it necessary to
make schedule changes used the
same facilities, thus eliminating
the necessity of visiting the State
hall otﬁces.

ESA Slates

F or Affair

Shouts of “Hi Susie!” and
“Hello Bill!” will ring across
the stately Commons Room,
mingling with the pleasant hum
of friendly conversations and
innumerable introductions as the
evening session students gather
once again at the beginning of an-
other school year to meet old
friends, discuss summer vacations,
tell‘ their friends about their
courses this year, and in general,
have a friendly get-together.

Open House Week, as this fes-
tivity is called, will be held the
week beginning Monday, October

14. Director J. Lloyd Mahony
has announced that classes will be
cut short to allow for more time
at the intermissions.

The ESA, under the leadership
of Pau_l Hanna, president, has
planned an unusual program this
year. Bernie Armstrong, organist
at the Alvin, will play the new
Hammond electric organ. Punch
and cookies will serve to add to
the party atmosphere.

All evening students, and es-
pecially those who are registering
in the evening school for the ﬁrst
time, are invited to come down to

the Commons Room on any of
these evenings. Members of the
faculty, officers of the Evening
Student’s Association, and leaders
in the various sororities and fra-
ternities will be on hand to greet
old students and to help make the
new students feel at home.

Evening Events

Full Calendar

Following the custom of the
Evening Students’ Association
each year, the publication of
the Student Directory, better
known as the Little Green
Book, has been placed in the
hands of the student body.

Purpose of the book is to ac-
quaint the general student body
with the Evening School organi-
zations, and to, give them a calen-
dar of all Evening School func-
tions and holidays.

With the exception of the An-
nual SpringiProm that is held the
ﬁrst Saturday evening in May, all
ESA social functions are ‘free to
the evening student: and their
friends. In the back of the Green
Book there are six coupons that
will be exchanged for two tick-
ets of admission during the ex-
change period. The exchange ‘pe-
riods will be published well in ad-
vance of the respective events.

These books will prove valuable
during the year to the students,
since it answers almost any ques-
tion about organizations and or-
ganization functions. .

Students who do not -receive
their Green; Book. may , obtain
them by presenting, their regis-
tration cards at the Evening
[School office; 142 Cathedral.‘

Begin Year’s
Social Activities

W'omen will get their ﬁrst
chance to join the Pitt ‘Vom-
en’s Club at the ‘Nelcome Tea
on Saturday, October 2, when
an interesting program has
been planned, according to Sara
lVIcAfee, president.

This club is open to all women
students of the Evening Division.
It is a social organization with
monthly meetings, two of which
are business meetings; the others
include teas, bridge parties and
luncheons.

Those girls who smile out from
behind the lunch counter in the
lounge are members. The lunch
counter is run exclusively by the
Pitt Women’s Club, and the proﬁts
from this go toward two $25 schol-
arships a semester, which are
given to members of the club on
the basis of participation in ac-
tivities and scholarship.

I The oﬁicers for this year include
besides Miss McAfee, Florence C.
Tabor, vice president; Leona J.
Robertson, secretary; and Martha
K. Tomar, treasurer.

Other sororities are starting the
season with equally great activity.
Kedems will have a week-end
outing September 25. Their next
event is a beneﬁt bridge on Satur-

day, October 16. October 2 is the 

date of the Phi Theta Phi party.
Phi Delta Gamma, national fra-
ternity for graduate women, is
holding a party on October 8, and
the Kappa Chapter will have a
get-together the latter part of Oc-

Mahoney Notes

Increase
In Enrollment
Registration in the Evening

Session, with many closed sections
and classrooms throughout ﬁlled
to capacity, is setting a precedent
this fall, L. Lloyd Mahony, direc-
tor of the school, announced Fri-
day.

REGISTRATION EXTENDED

Incomplete returns indicate that
this year’s registration will exceed
that of last year by about 15 per-
cent, it was disclosed. Increased
demands on mathematics, ac-
counting, banking, law, econom-
ics and mechanical drawing class-
es have necessitated the organiza-
tion of additional sections. Due to
the large increase in students, J.
G. Quick, University Registrar, de-
cided to continue the registration
throughout the past week in ada-
dition to the previous week.

The English department, which
usually, according to the Regis-
tar’s office feels the brunt of
heavy registration, announced sev-
en sections of Freshman English
have been ﬁlled, frustrating all ef-
forts to consolidate some of the
classes.
