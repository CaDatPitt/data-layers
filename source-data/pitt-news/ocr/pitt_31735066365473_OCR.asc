A 33-year-old assistant profes-
“"sor of chemistry at the University
has been named Pitt’s _n_ew Dean
g. of Student Affairs-

Dr. Alfred L. Moye will take
over the position at the end of this
‘term. _

 The Student Affairs office
had been headed by V Bern-
ard J. Kobosky who, in July. was
named Vice Chancellor for Public
Affairs. He had continued to” man-
age the student affairs office on
an interim basis. as well.

Also in July, a task force of fac-

ulty, students and administrators
was appointed by Ch_ancellor.Pos-
.var to study the student affairs
area at the University and deter-
mine its long-range role.

In- consultation with the task

_force. the Pitt administration

. transferred responsibility for two
of the offices formerly under the
jurisdiction of' student affairs——
Admissions and Student Aid. and

_., Jousing——to, respectively, the Of-
{ice of the Provost and the Office
of Operations.

Posvar said that. .VIoye’s ap-
pointment was not a temporary
-one. However, he added, "Since
the scope of the office may be
subject to modification, the title
of the administrator has been
changed to ‘dean’ and Dr. Moye
' ' taking a leave of absence from

is teaching, duties so that he can
retain his faculty options while
the task force continues its
studies.”

Professor Moye, who earned
"his Ph.D. at Pitt in 1968 and has
been teaching here since that

: time, was one of the recipients of
the Excellence in Teaching Award
of the College of Arts and Sciences

Dellums decries political rhetoric

by VICKI TUTIN

“We have to bring together the politics of the
oppressed into a whole new political alternative
that will counteract" the present political rhetoric,"
stated Ronald Dellums, freshman Representative

 from California, in a speech here Friday.

According to ‘Dellums, the greatest problem

iii‘

 in America today is the inequity of distri‘bution of
3  power and wealth. with those in power utilizing the
:3 lg policy of divide, confuse. and rule.

is
:

“The rhetoric of power is one thing, and ‘the
I reality another. We must break down the economic
_, situation so that the people in the street understand

. ’§§&hat’s going on aroundthem,” he stated.

Dellums expressed concern that the people‘un-
derstand their situation andthen act on that under-

standing.

"If the scientists are telling us that the last
curtain is falling on the last act of the big show." he
said. "isn't it absurd for us to be standing around
_calling ourselves niggers and hunkies‘? The lights

are going to go out for everyone.“

Unity is Dellums’ solution to the problem. “You
don't have to be black to be a nigger in this country
today,” said Dellums, “Chicanos, Asian ' Ameri-
cans, women, long-haired protesters, native Amer-
icans under 39, are all niggers in this country.”

According to Dellums. the system has “nig-
_ gers" so brainwashed thattheyfight against one an-
 other. that they have opposed everyone ‘who tried

 to be free.

 

 "Since everyone has become a nigger. were
,/gﬁzhnot going to split_people up.“ he stated. "When the
{:.‘Man must struggle against all the oppressed forces

igcoming against him at once. has gotproblems." -

ALFRED MOYE

"This sensitivity to students
and his ability to work w_ith them
were primary reasons for his se-
lection,” said Posvar. "It is my
hope that Professor Moye can in-
creasingly relate student activ-
ities both to the academic mission

V and to the public service of the in-

stitution.”

As Dean of, Student Affairs.
Moye will have overall responsi-
bility for student activities. the
University counseling and place-
ment centers, the international
student office, the student health
service. and special student pro-
grams.

Moye was born in New Wind-.

sor, .VId., and earned his B.S. de-
gree from West Virginia Wes-
leyan College in 1960. He subse-

quently served as an instructor at-

West Virginia Wesleyan.

. Forbes plan emerges

by EVAN PATTAK
Associate Editor

A new plan for development in

-the ‘Forbes Field area. grudgingly

approved by Oaklandcommunity
representatives. will be presen_t-

, ed to the General State Authority

Wednesday.

If the Authority (GAS) ap-
proves the proposal. work on the
initial phase of the-Forbes area
development. postponed since
March while the University._the
community. the city. and the state
debated plans for the Forbes area.
could begin again.

The new plan calls for construc-
tionof a building -to house the

School of Law on the sites of what,

are currently the Civic Center Mo-
tel _and the Esso station. The area
is bounded by Forbes’ Ave.. S. Bou-
quet St., Sennott St. and David L.
Lawrence Hall.

A graduate school—School of
Education complex would be
erected parallel to Sennott St. in
the Forbes Field area’. The build-
ings would be connected by an
overhead bridge, the use of which
would enable Sennott St. to be
kept open.

Parking space for 550"cars
would ’be located beneath the
graduate school complex. ' 

David Houston. a member of
People's Oakland. called’ the plan

"the least undesirable plan of
any discussed. He and other com-

. munity representatives based

their approval of the plan on the
University’s future acceptance of
two additional stipulations.

The first of these is that the
ground floor of the graduate

"school complex be set aside for

joint community/University use.

Dellums said he finds it strange that with all

the internal problems facing the U.S. today, war is
our top priority.

"Weassume that we're the number one power.
so we relate to others with bullets and bombs. we
shove democracy down their throats by shoving a
bayonet in their face.

"We have to end the insanity of militarism. of
death and destruction." said Dellums. "we have to

go on to the greatest challenge to a human being. the

fight for life.“

people."

, for rhetoric.

to peace."

Aiming to unite all the “niggers” of the world,
Dellums reminded blacks that “Vietnam is a black
question,'it became so when the first black man died
in Southeast Asia, when we sent brothers from all
over the country to kill other niggers.”

Dellums alleged that many Americans are psy-
chologically dead because they think the system is
too much to overthrow. However. he said. "This
country isn‘t run by brilliant people. but by bigoted

Hecontended that "the name of the game in
Washington is not ‘Save the Children‘ or ‘Save the
World.‘ but rather ‘Save my job." -

For himself, he said,” I'm there for two years,
‘and if I don't come back, it jioesn’t matter: I’lll
meet everyone in the Land of Freedom.”

The Congressmen had one plea. that the people
of this country work together and substitute reality

"I know." he said. “that the niggers can join
hands and take this country from madness to hu-
manity. from bigotry to brotherhood. from racism

Community representatives also
,asked that a permanent_ vehicle
for joint University/community
planning be established. Houston
said that this latest plan had been
the product of “joint citing. not
joint planning." He said that the
community had been presented
finished building plans and could
only. suggest sites for them.

Community spokesmen voiced

the fear that without such a plan- g
‘ ning vehicle. the would be present-

ed similarly finished products for
phases II and III of the Forbes
area development.

Charles Blum, Deputy Execu-
tive Director of the GSA, said that
he would report the two commun-
ity requests to the GSA along with
the new plan, but that he expects
the University and the community
to hammer out workable solutions
to both matters. _

The plan. if accepted by the
GSA which would finance it. would

require 10 months before working "

drawings could be completed and

$5 million more than the amount '

already allocated for the ‘Forbes
area project by the state. '
Blum said he would ask the GSA

to "wrestle" with the funding‘

problem.

“It is my hope,” he said, “that
they (the GSA) will see fit to ac-
cept the plan and somehow fund
it, because I feel this would be a

good compromise for all parties _

‘ involved.” -

'._‘_-'3,‘ ‘.‘

Blum would not predict whether ' i

or not the GSA would approve the
plan.

Should the plan be accepted. the

University would be forced to

make at least one compromise-

with the city of Pittsburgh.

Pittsburgh Mayor Peter.Flaher- «

ty imposed a moratorium on the
expansion of tax-exempt institu-
tions onto any land not off the city
tax rolls by Dec. 4, 1970.

Since the University acquired

the land proposed f'or the site of-

the Law School building after that
date. it would be obliged‘ to make

up some of the lost tax revenue

to the city. A
Chancellor Wesley Posvar and

Vice-Chancellor Bernard ‘Kobosky V

were to meet with Mayor Flaher- 

ty this morning to try to forge a

compromise.

The latest proposal for devel-
opment in the Forbes Field area
evolved from six meetings among
architects from the city, the com-
munity, the_ University, and the
GSA.

The architects were charged with
the task of creating an alternative

to the University’s so-called.

"Phase I” plan, scrapped July 28
in the face of community,
and state objections.

Black Studies major '  
wins informal consent

by POHLA SMITH -
News Editor

A plan to establish a Black’

Studies -major was favorably
received by members of_ the
College of Arts and Sciences
Council at its meeting Friday.

The proposal. which was ad-
vanced by Dr. Jack Daniel and
CurtissPorterof the Black Studies
Department. will probably be sub-
mitted for a formal Council vote
at the next meeting.

Measures to disseminate more

information. on Black Studies «

were also discussed Friday.

Daniel said arrangements would
be made immediately to familiar-
ize academic advisors with Black

Studies courses so advisors can.

encourage students to register for
them. Daniel said the Black
Studies Department is also con-
sidering such solutions as meet-
ing with freshmen at orientation
and making better course descrip-
tions available.

Daniel made the comments af-
ter Dean Jerome Schneewind of
the College of Arts and Sciences
asked for proposals to alleviate a
problem brought up in a recent
Pitt News editorial—a relatively
small number of white students
take advantage of Black Studies
‘courses.

FOUR DIVISIONS
Explaining the implementation
of a Black Studies major, Daniel
and Porter said students could
choose their major from four di-

visions: Black Humanities, Black’

Social Sciences, African Studies,
and Caribbean Studies.

Each division, in turn. would be
divided into two or more concen-

trations. The major portion of a _

students study would be devoted
to one concentration; for in-
stance, a Black Humanities ma-

jor could concentrate in Black Art‘

and Culture, Black Literature, or
Black Language.

A Black Studies major would.
constitute 30 credits—12 in the f _‘

chosen concentration, six from
the other concentrations in the di-
vision. three credits from each of

city. .

the other three divisions, and t

three credits from any
Studies area.

The House of Representatives passed legislation_last week
to give general purpose Federal grants to all colleges and uni-
versities in the United States. The Senate had passed similar
legislation during the summer. '

Previous grants have been earmarked for purposes of research.
student aid and construction. This is the first program that would al-
low colleges to use the funds as they wanted. ‘

The provision approved by the House was contained in an over-all

C bill,..pa_ssed last week including aid to higher education over a five year

period, prohibition of funding for school busing programs, and the
establishment of standards for the enrollment of women at colleges.

Representative Edith Green (D.-Oregon) was responsible for pro-
posing the general purpos_e grants. — -‘

According to Sally Kirkgasler, research assistant on Green’s sub-
committee on education, “She was convinced colleges are in desperate
trouble. All of the studies done have shown that they are in a financial,
crisis." ' V

SEX AND ADMISSIONS

Also included as part of the over-all bill. the House voted to re-
quire co-educational schools to treat men and women equall_y when they
apply for admission. Schools becoming co-educational would have sev-

~  en years to make the transition.

Schools where all students are of the same sex would be excluded.
In short, colleges would be permitted to prohibit the enrollment of
women or men as a matter of policy.

The bill was passed with an attachment of President .\lixon‘s pro-
posal to give Federal fina‘nlcia‘l"assistance"to“communities that are de-

- segregating their schools. Busing was not to be funded as part of the

measure. '

Passing an amendment by John M. Ashbrook (R.-Ohio). the House
banned federally required school busing ‘programs and prohibited the
government from paying for the busing when a court orders it.

Representative Green, in an article in the Pittsburgh Press. ar-
gued that Ashbrook’s proposal should be strengthened to prohibit any
Department of Health Education and Welfare employee from urging
any school board to use state and local funds for a purpose that federal
funds could not be used for—busing.

Representative 'Green’s amendment to the bill prohibits federal

‘officials from interfering on local school boards and would ban the

HEW desegregation “guidelines."

The second meeting ofthe Con-
stitutional Review Subcommittee
was marked by a dispute over the
appointment of a new member.

The debate stemmed from one
appointee’s decision not to parti-
cipate. was fomented by a viola-
tion of procedure. and ended in a
decision to postpone any action on
the nomination.

Announcing that Harris Miller
would participate only in an advi-
sory capacity, Steven Kaye, sub-
committee chairman, called for
the nominations to fill the empty
chair. Kaye suggested Ron Hart-
man as‘ a possible choice. Linda
Bulick and Marty McHale were
also nominated. A vote was taken
and Kaye named Hartman as the
new member.

The meeting continued as Ka_ve
clarified deadlines. dates. and
procedures. As the topic of ground
rules was brought to the f'loor. Jan
Miller. visibly agitated. referred
to the vote previously taken.

"I do not see it.” she saidfas pro-
per. especially in the case where
you referred to this as an open
meeting, that a consensus or un-
written agreement of any sort be
sought on issues before meetings."

Dennis Concilla added his views
on the election of Hartman. “What
Jan is referring to is the fact that
Ron came in obviously having
been told that he was being nom-
inated, ' giving members of the
committee a preconceived idea.”
Concilla compared the election to
a “kangaroo court,” with’ “ballots
already being counted.”

Kaye apologized for any alleged
incorrect actions.

MILLER
Visibly Shaken

Discussing voting processes.
the committee again became im-

ﬂmersed in argument. A two-thirds
E majority was suggested as neces-
_sary for the passage of any deci-

sions. as was a simple majority.
A committee member noticed that
this action was backward, since
Hartman’s appointment had al-
ready been decided by a simple
majority vote.

“The vote should have been
taken only after deciding the
ground rules,” said Mary Goess-
ler.

Hartman’s appointment was

postponed and thecommittee fin-
ally agreed that on procedural

 
 

matters. a simple majority vote
would apply. but the final docu-
ment would require a two-thirds
consensus.

The committee then turned to a
discussion of the possible struc-
ture of the executive branch of
the Student Association. Albert
Watts suggested a "watchdog"
concept: a "calendar committee"
and "clearing house" role were
also discussed.

- While, part of the committee dis-
sected the Studen't Association
Constitution and government with
pencil and paper, another part
simultaneously discussed. the
philosophy’ behind a student gov-
ernment——whether it was neces-
sary and feasible. ~.

The meeting adjourned with
Mary Huber‘s suggestion to “look

.4-
: <‘

at the philosophy behind student .

government and get down and re-
view it" before re-structuring it.
The one point of complete con-

currence among. the membersﬂaay
was the first section of the pre—‘-”'

ciation: "All undergraduates reg-

ed to attend.

. LANGUAGE REQUIREMENT

Porter said the Black Studies
Department would require a ma-
jor to take a foreign language,
presumably an African one. Ma-
jors will also be encouraged to
take related courses from such
departments as Political Science
and Economics. I

When questioned on the value
of a Black Studies major to a stu-
‘dent planning graduate work. Por-
ter said that the background would
be_ excellent for‘ anyone planning
to continue his studies in the Hu-
manities or Social Sciences.
Eventually. Porter said, the De-
partment hopes to be able to

offer graduate courses in Black
Studies.

In their written rationale forfii I

their proposal, Daniel and Porter
stated: “Black Studies must’ pro-
ject a future for Black people. For
the Black people who are en-
meshed in an exploitative system,
this projection must begin with
an analysis of the entrapment and
move on productively to concrete
alternatives in thought and ac-
tion.

"Black education professes t‘o
provide the student of Black
Studies with a perception, .a men-
tal facility, plus the academic and
philosophical tools for continuing
the development of alternative
systems.” -

Hypertension studied    

by RON LOZOWSKI
Feature Editor

Dr. Joseph Buckley. chair-
man and associate dean of phar-
macology here” at the Univer-
sity. is currently researlching the
causes of hypertension. .

The studies. initiated in

1959. partially attempt to dis-"

cern the area of the brain trig-
gering the disorder._

According to Buckley. the
data "suggest that the central"
site of action of angiotensin II
(a drug which raises blood
pressure) is located in the peri-
aqueductal gray region of the
mesencephalon.” the area of
the brain involved in maintain-
ing balance within the cardio-
vascular (heart and blood vessel)
system. -.

Buckley and his colleagues
isolated the head of a dog, keep-
ing it alive through surgical link-
age with ' a donor animal. Ex-

periments were also performed‘

with anesthetized, cats. Using
various techniques, synthetic
angiotensin II was administer-
ed to the animals to further de-

termine the nature of its effects.
“Angiotensin II, in sufficient

dosage. does apparently pass the A

blood-brain barrier and produce

effects in the central nervous‘

system.” said Buckley.
Buckley noted that other it in-.

vestigators disagree "as to the“
exact mechanism and site of

action. It is most likely that

there are several mechanics and lb

several si tes of action involved."

“There exists ‘the possibility

that the action of angiotensin II
on central receptors plays an
important role in the develop-

ment of sustained cardiovasc,u- 

lar hypertensive disease.”

Buckley added that he hopes.

his research may aid in further-

ing therapeutic treatment of the
disease. . A’

The ‘most immediate problem facing

law schools.

The law school, with an enrollment »

‘of.just over 500 students. opeates in
an area of not more than 30,000

‘The law school’s courtroom facility is

ards. ,

One rumor circulating attributes the
hope for more space to a desire on the
part of administrators to see the law
school double or triple its enrollment.
Lawschool Dean W. Edward Sell de-
nies this desire and points out that the
Forbes I plans-_allow only 80,000 square
feet of usable space for a new law
school. ‘

According to "Sell. the space request
resulted’ from the law school’s decision
that its enrollment "not grow beyond
500 students..”_ The 80.000 square feet of
usable space will not adequately sup-
port a student bodyof more than 500.

The law school’s space problem .can
only be, considered in relation to its bud-
get problem. Characteristic of the finan-
cial constraint faced by the Pitt Law

-School are the results of a recent survey -

of the nation’s accredited law schools.
"Pitt fell in‘ the" bottom half of the facul-
ty salaries scale. The problems of draw-
ing talented faculty are obvious.

The space and budget problems be-
come -even-more acute when considered
in relation to the improved position of

Catholic liturgy/s meaning. sketched

 Editor: ~ .
' Does meaning still exist within Roman
V Catholicism?
From - the article “'Soul-Coaxing"

(Pitt News, Nov. 5) it would tend to
_make one wonder. Admittedly, Roman
Catholicism continues until present day

_and will interminably continue to evolve.

discovering -methods to serve God and

V man. Always there -is room for improve-

ment, but it must be pointed out that
very often the main attributes of B0-

 man Catholicism are brushed over.

A Nowadays since Vatican II, many of the
laity are often in a quandary as to what the
faith means, as to how it can help tliem to

- relate to God and their neighbor. A ques-

tion arises: how can I find any fulfillment,

 _ especially with God.

Many times this may be a rather

' difficult question to answer with all the

criticism Roman Catholicism receives
from the media.

When the article “Soul-Coaxing"
gives a derogatory account of Mass and
its appearance, this question receives
enhancement. To me, the article proved
unfair when it did not give the theology
behind the Mass, the reasons why we
have the liturgy, tradition, and have in-

. corporated outward signs in the Mass.

xi

Mass in itself is the ultimate in
meeting God -— the celebration of bread
and‘ wine‘ when they go through transub-
stantiation become the actual living
Christ upon the altar, the Eucharisti
Sacrifice. t

.In Roman Catholic dogma, it is
Christ Himself who comes into the pres-
ence of the congregation in bodily form.
although veiled» under the appearances
of bread and wine, being present in
both divinity and humanity—the God-

, Man.

"To non-Catholics the Mass will ap-

pear to be nothing more than sheer ritu--

alism, ceremony, and mystical tradi-

tion. I cannot expect anyone outside the’

Gemperlein commended

Editor:

I should like to correct the impression that we really know
how many deaths have resulted from the military, crack-

’ down; we simply do not know.

   

What we do know is that the United States is implicated

in the disaster and that American relief agencies are predict-
ipg that as many as 200,000 children will die within the next
 few weeks if more generous relief is not forthcoming. -— .
'o’tesst*>   '

Joyce Gemperlein is to. be commended for her report on

faith to react so the first time they see
Mass. . 2 -

Ye_t, before" criticism’ of liturgy and
worship comes. Irecommend strongly
that the liturgy is understood “on its theo-
logical grounds and how all the cere-
mony in Mass relates‘ in preparation of a‘
great feast: the redemption of mankind
and the sorrow of the Crucifixion, but
still more.

Whenever Mass’ is celebrated, in

Roman Catholicism» ‘it is believed that
Christ’s death and -Resurrection - are

actually re—enacted whenever we come '

to celebrate the paschal mysteries.
Christ's death . upon the Cross and

His Resurrection are actually recurring I

'at Mass in their fullness,’ washing the
congiiegation of their sins and taking
them to the Father with Christ as High
Priest and Mediator. I

Of course, if Mass is approached with

. lazy and inappropriate attitudes to cele-

brate the Divine Feast. little if any bene-
fit can be expected to occur. Mass‘ bene-

fits are a ‘two-job proposition: God will
provide the grace, but the participant
must do his best to receive it worthily. /

In response to the line that “The Ora-
tory seems much less responsive to stu-
dent values and needs” when compared
to the Hillel and Lutheran Centers, I

‘can only say that for ‘whatever is found

lacking by students, a voice should be
raised and effort made to alter or modi-
fy the style of campus ministries to satis-
wants and needs.

Improvement can always be made.
butif the support, the drive, and the
help does not exist to aid the priests,
it is a monolithic job indeed. Let all
with needs respond!

“Why such a shallow’ report?’ V

I Editor; others’ positions and problems?

I write in regards to your editorial’

of Nov. 3 (“Cycle of Suspicion Dents
Black Studies Bridge”), Presumably on
my part, I am the unnamed but fre-

quently mentioned adviser, to whom the
writer occasionally refers and who
served as a source of some of the arti-
cle’s information.

It will serve little purpose for me,‘
to try to define the several points on
which my memory of our conversation
differs from that of the reporter’s. I will
simply state that you have done a great
disservice to the information which I
was trying to provide.

I know Bill Gormley to be a ration-
al, intelligent student and reporter who
seemingly has some depth of analytical,
ability. After speaking with him for 20-
30* minutes Sundayevening, I had hop-
ed that I had provided information which

included some type of contextual setting ‘

in which the role ‘of the CAS adviser
could be examined.

  

ih addition,‘ 'i"’ihéii§v}-."”th;t _i”‘h‘ati' '

indicated to Bill that I was only one of
a very diverse group of graduate students
who are employed in the Advising Cen-
ter. I tried to’ relate that the way I
approached my job was not necessarily
indicative of what any other, ‘much less
a majority, adviser did in his or.hers.

Unfortunately, not only am I wrongly
characterized, but that incorrect image
is then transferred to, be reflective of
the whole Advising Center staff.

Knowing‘ Bill
I now wonder how possible it is for any
people’ to . communicate when the re-
alities which they perceive so prevent
them from‘ understanding each other.

The Miracle Worker by William
Gibson opened Friday evening at
the Stephen Foster Memorial. the
first production of the year for
the University Theatre. For two
hours. Director Leland Starnes
and the cast provide one of the
most exciting evenings in the the-
ater that has ever been seen at
this University.

I In fact. with this-production it
is almost mandatory that we stop
referring to the University as
producing “college theater” (de-
noting less than professional).
For in Stephen Foster there is
pure. delightful. moving drama.
as fine and accurate a theatrical
event as could be seen in this en-
tire area.

William Gibson’s play traces
the story of the young Helen Kell-
er. Born_with normal perception.
she is struck deaf and blind at the

~. age of 19 months. The Kellers



send for a teacher in the hopes of
aiding the child to understand. be-
have, be human. 4

Ann Sullivan arrives from the
Perkins School for the Blind to un-
dertake the task. Her goal is ‘to
teach the child to communicate.
“How can'I teach you Helen -
that the word stands for the thing
. . . water . . . w-a-t-e-r (she finger
spells) . '. . it has a name. You will

learn, Helen, that your fingers‘

can talk. ' I ‘ _ 
“Once she’ understands, Mrs’.
Keller.’ there’s not a thought or a-
fact or a word that can’t be hers.”
It is a rough battle all the way.

sensitive and moving portrayal as

Helen’s teacher. Her extremely

.accurate interpretation is an ex-,

hausting‘ one, evoking Jaughter,
warmth, and tears from the {en-
tire audience. Her movements,
actions, and delivery are the

- marks of a professional.

Keller. Playing the part of a deaf
and blind child. she moves on the

One of the bright spots for the Panthers, during a very dismal afte<r- _
noonagainst the Irish of Notre Dame Saturday was Ralph Cindrich’s
jarring tackle of John Cieszowski forcing the iunior fullback to fum-

ble. Pitt recovered at the one.

A well-conditioned Penn State team made it
very clear that they were the best group in the-annual
Big’ Four Cross Country Meet last Friday
afternoon by defeating Pitt, West Virginia, and
Syracuse. -

Penn State, coming off a win over Villanova
last week, dominated the action throughout the
race and took five of the first six places to score
their low total of 16 points. Bitt (47), West Vir-
ginia (87);
the Lions:

Aside from the score, a lot of unexpected.'but
pleasing, things happened. The Schenley’ Park
course saw its record, previously held by Sid Sinks
of Bowling Green, fall ten times "in the exciting
climax at Flagstaff Hill.

_ The first ten finishers in the race all eclipsed
Sinks. mark (31:-
34.0). C - -

The Pitt cheer-
leaders appeared
just before the
starting gun to
build a little en-
thusiasm before
the meet. but
Chancellor Wesley
Posvar pulled. the
surprise of the day
by viewing the
race from a helli-
‘Copter,

From the helli-
-copter. Posvar saw
the race well
above the hilly;

 

MICKEY COLLINS

— treed terrain of Schenley Park and later landed to

chat with the runners. and the close to a hundred
spectators. who‘ turned the meet into a spectator
sport. “

The meet, which was expected to be a close
and well balanced one, showed Penn State’s dom-
ination from the start. By midrace,-the Lions were
in position for their strong- finish. At the halfway
point of the race, State held the first five positions
and it seemed that the meet once again was turn-
ing into a dual meet with the Bannermen.

Greg Fredricks and Charles McGuire paced all I

runners and tied for first place with a time of
30:37.0 and broke Sinks record by 57 seconds. Jim
Allahan and Dan Supolski. who barely edged Mike
Collins out in the stretch rounded out the Nittanny

Lions contingent in the top'five. Collins hung on to g
take fifth place and-avert a Pitt shutout as well

1’ Though...everyone expected. the
Pitt Panthers to give the Notre
Damelrishmen a battle on‘Sat-
urday afternoon, ND handed the
Cats the perennial shellacking
typical of the team’s meetings
in the past seven years.

The margin of victory for the
South Benders, 56-7, was inci-
dental as the Irish completely

almost scored twice more.

After the game, a joyful ND
Coach Ara Parseghian admitted
that, "I did not envision a score
like this on the Pitt team. iWe
knew that Pitt had a good offen-
sive team, but "then we are a
great defensive team.”

Parseghian’_s estimation of his
. defensive unit is almost an un-
derstatement. The Panthers, who
moved the ball well allseason,
were stymied by the Irish de-
fense and could not even man-
age a first down until 6:55 of
the second quarter.

Pitt Coach Carl DePasqua
heaped praise on the ‘Irishmen.
“They’re a great defensive foot-
ball team. We-found that they
\ converged

with " unbelievable
quickness.” ' s ..

Bruce Fisher (S), Don Sauer (WVU), and Dave

' Szabat (P) crossed the finish line as the last of the '

record breakers.

Whether Posvar could viewallthe details of the
meet through the brightly colored autumn foliage:
of Schenley Park. is questionable,‘ but Mike Sc_nur-
ko. Harry Groves. the State coach. and Jim ‘Banner
all had clear cut answers as to what had happened
during the race. ‘ ‘ -

“Penn State is the better team.” said Shurko. I

"There’s no question about it. Sid Sinks was an all-

. American andnational champion. They broke his.
._ record by almost a minute. That’s an indication of -

;how good they are.-Not only are they a good team.

but they all run well today.” V -» . “’

“Finishing with the top four. spotsvwas kind of
exciting for us,” commented Groves. “We knew that
if anybody was going to /beat’ us they would have
to run very fast because we’re in good condition.” _

Banner.’ who kept a close tab on the race via,
his car, pointed out the Pitt mistake. ~

“What can you say.” exclaimed Banner. "We

'all ran our fas'test times, but we made mental er-
rors. We let the pace get too far ahead of— us. /We
got beatby a ibettenteam, this day. Maybe on an-
other day things could be different.” .

‘ The officiating had much to

a game with two teams who are
striving for an invitation to the
Collegiate Athletic

. "Many people came up to me
after the game and described

the penalty area.”

In the past three years the
score of the Pitt-West Virginia
soccer match has been identical
1-0 scores- Last year Pitt and
both years before that West Vir-
ginia was victorious.

The defeat still doesn’t elim-
inate Pitt from the minds of the
NCAA selection committee.
West Virginia is 7-2-0 and Penn
State is '5-2-1 with State not
faring as well as Pitt’s 7-2-2. 4

“At least one victory in the
next two games and we're in.”
stated Coach Bemis Friday be-.
fore the game.

PlTT’S BIG fullback Fernando Carriquiry halts a Slippery Rock drive during
last week's 8-0 victory. The booters sputtered against WVU on Satur-
day, 1-0.

Penn State topped Temple
9-0 Saturday and is Pitt’s op-
ponent this weekend.

“But West Virginia has a fine
team,” commented Coach Be-
mis. “They have been over-
looked in the Southern confer-
ence. They have played two
good teams, Navy and Penn State,
other than us. Penn State beat
them (WVU) 2-1 and Navy 1-
0.7’

"They recruited three play-
ers from Lorain Ohio junior
college team which was runner-
up in the NCAA tournament last
year in the junior college divi-
sion. Two players form the Ni-
gerian National team there too.
With all this talent they have
nine lettermen from last year
sitting on the bench.”

  

“Big Poison’ makes a killing

Though “Big Poison" had a rough
time this weekend on the paddle-
ball courts. he forged into the lead
of the Yogi race and looks like a
good bet to cop the crown.

Keeping everyone in stitches.
including himself. all week-end,
"Poison" laughed his way to a 9-6
showing, putting him a full three
games ahead of stumbling "Chun-
ky,” who was on top for seven
weeks.

“Chunky." who had a pathetic
5-10, appears to be fed up with the
top position. If he doesn’t tighten

his belt and produce some win-
ning percentages. “Poison's”
temporary supremacy may be-
come permanent. ‘It‘ll be interest-
ing what "Poison" has brewing
for "Chunky‘s” next meal, if
"Gazebo" doesn’t throw it all up.

Gannon loss In Erle
by MYERS and MACK L

The Pitt Hockey Club evened its record with a 10-2 shellacking of
Duquesne Sunday. after dropping its opener. at Gannon. 7-5.

Using their superior strength and depth the icers mauled the Dukes
all evening long in their first home contest of the 1971-72 season at Al-
pine Ice Chalet. Combining some tough defense and constant pressure.

Pitt kept the Dukes on the run. Af-
ter the first six minutes of play.
Duquesne was no longer in the
game. ‘

Pitt skater Frank Williams.
voted one of the game's outstand-
ing players. pulled the hat trick-
for the icers. With one of his goals
coming with 2:00 left in the sec-
ond period and the other two add-
ing icing to the victory in the final
frame, Williams joined Bill Glan-
villed. Tom Lang. Dennis
Browne, "Mike Kohl, Ken Metz.
and Tom Povlick in Pitts scoring
column.

Duquesne recorded its first
tally on a slap shot by Co-coach
Dudley Cotton, 9:04 in the first
period. This goal tied the game at
one apiece-since Glanville start-
ed the scoring off with tally 15
seconds after the initial faceoff.

-Lang’s goal at 8:37 in the first
frame put Pitt ahead to stay.

A screaming crowd of over 600
spectators cheered both Pitt and
Duquesne on. When the final whis-
tle blew most realized that it was
never a contest.

The squad was defeated by the
skaters of Gannon College, 7-5; in
its first game’ of the season,
played at the Glenfield Ice Rink
in Erie, Pa., Friday.

‘Edison Montgomery has been
appointed associate vice chancel-
lor, Health Professions, at the
University. The appointment,
effective October 11. was for-
mally announced by Chancel-
lor Posvar.

Montgomery has been affili-
ated with the University since
1956 in the capacity of director
of personnel, director of bud-
get, and later, vice chancellor
for finance. ’

The skaters came on strong in
the first period with a display of
pinpoint passing and thorough
backchecking.

Bill Glanville scored the first
Pitt goal with only :43 of the first
period gone. Gannon tied it up
five minutes later. but Pitt retali-
ated with a goal by Jim Richter.
Denny Browne added a power play
goal at the 13:32 mark. and the
Icers led after one period, 3-1.

The second period was a com-
plete reversal of the first as Gan-
non skated out shooting. 'Pitt
goalie Mark Lieberman was bom-
barded with a constant stream of
pucks‘ and with five minutes
elapsed, Gannon tied the score,
3-3. Pitt failed to put a shot on
goal during those five minutes,
but at 7:05 of the second period,
Mike Kohl scored to give Pitt the
lead, 4-3. They led through the
remainder of the period. '

Pitt then started the third per-
iod a man short, but with a strong
defensive effort, stymied the Gan-

non power play. However, the Pitt ~

skaters obviously tired from the
fast pace and Gannon scored four
times in ten minutes to turn the
game around and give Gannon a
7-4 lead. Pitt fought back with a
goal by Frank Williams, but solid
goaltending held the Panthers at
bay.
