The Pitt News

Pitt students were offered a
smorgasbord of political
aspirations at _the Meet the
Candidates forum last night,
where Student Government Board
hopefuls unanimously supported
a North Oakland shuttle and
computer lab, increased campus
safety and more student
representation in university
decisions.

. o SGB candidatejacob Brody said
» the administration shouldn’t forget

“the primary mission of this
institution is to provide its students
with an "education. Pitt is not a
business; we are not customers.
Pitt is a school; we are its students.”

Brody wants to create a student
assembly to work with the
administration as a decision-
making body like the University
Senate‘. The student assembly
would be a long—term project
which students “won’t see
completed in my board term.”
Brody said he has discussed the
project informally with President

O’Connor.

“The right of representation
musttalso be adhered-to by the
university. In this period of
transition  the students of this

university must demand and

receive the right to equal
representation in the governing
structure of this institution.”

Brody Said an SGB cultural-
diversity committee is needed to
represent Pitt’s diverse
population. The committee
would work with the Black Action
Society on the proposed black
cultural center.

“The enhancement of the
current university cultural
diversity committee and the
creation of an SGB cultural
diversity committee to facilitate
the incorporation of different
ideals is an absolute must,” Brody
said. '

-SGB candidate Abbie Campsie

wants to improve Pitt’s food/

service, currently provided by a
company she ‘incorrectly
identified as “Dexter.” Many
students are “dissatisfied with the
food in the cafeteria” after their
first year at Pitt, she said.

Campsie said she talked to Bob S‘

Hopkins, a Pitt food-service
administrator», about hiring a new
food-service contractor. But she
hadn’t talked to officials at DAKA,
which handles Pitt’s food service,
about instituting any changes,
she said. '
“If elected, one of my primary
goals will be to bring in a new
food service because Dexter, the
current one that we have, has an
expiring contract that will end in

‘January. We could bring in a

different and better—handled
service that would offer food that
is both enjoyable and that gives
the students more choices of what
to eat,” Campsie said. '

She also said students'should
“try and involve more faculty in

student—life activities. Iwould like '

to see professors go and speak to
student groups and residence
halls‘ about premieres, classes and
current events. This way, both
the students and the faculty will
better understand each other.”

Campsie also wants
sophomore, junior and senior
representatives on the Board of
Trustees.

Skutches. “Students at Pitt are in

them.”

To rectify this “lack of

compvlfete revision of the
“ambiguous and confusing’?
Miscellaneous guide, which is a
“main source of campus
information.” The guide should

also be distributed more widely, ,

he said.

Skutches also wants more self-
defense classes on campus. “The
police don't help, so it's up to us
as students to act,” he said. A

Skutches supports a black
cultural center and said he spoke
to Black Action Society deputy
chair Justin Liang about it.

He said he would work to create
a North Oakland shuttle service
but didn't claim to be able to
bring “Pitt into nirvana.”

A North Oakland shuttle and
computer lab are necessary
because so many students live
there and don’treceive adequate
attention from the university,
according to Leichter. “This does

not seem right. This is not fair.‘

This I will change,” he said. '’

According to Leichter, these
services would naturally.reduce

students would not have to travel
to campus late at night. ,

“I ask you, why, when the

such as, ours is to breed scholars, I

do we hinder safety?" he asked.
Students need more study areas,

other than “the dimly lit Cathedral _ " ’

or the populated William Pitt

suggested a mural on the wall? in

Potential SGB members present campaign platforms

The following are essays that candidates
for this year’s Student Government Board
elections were required to submit. The
essays highlight their campaign platforms
and goals if elected.

Presidential Candidate Gil Golden:

“Our university is currently engaged in
a period of transition greater than any it
has experienced in the past quarter
century. In order to effectively make
these changes work to the advantage of
the undergraduate students, our Student
Government needs experienced and
effective leaders now more than ever.

“Experienced leaders have the
credentials to warrant election to Student
Government positions. Serving as an
allocations committee member, a board
member (president pro—tempore) and
acting president for three months, I have
gained the‘valuable insight necessary to
lead our Student Government Board.

.Additionally I am a member of various

other student organizations, which have
aided me in my understanding of the
needs and aspirations of Pitt’s
undergraduates.

“Effective leaders have histories to

verify their credentials. I implore you to
review my history, including my
allocations background, the fulfillment
of my campaign promises as a board
member and my proven ability to serve
as president of SGB. My history includes
the establishment of an academic affairs
committee, the creation of a president’s
council to ensure adequate representation
in important SGB decisions, new
breakthroughs in public course and
professorevaluations, the redesigning of
the Trees Hall weightroom and the
establishment of a much—nee_ded, late-

night study area.

“Don’t accept ‘a substitute for
responsible and proven leadership when
you can have the real thing."

The board candidates’ essays are
presented in the order in which the
candidate appears on the ballot.

Ambassador blames communists for Czech Woes

By David T. Welch
Asst. News Editor

Czechoslovakia has had
difficulty changing to a free-
rriarket economy since the

«democratic government took

power in 1989, according to Czech
ambassador Rita Klimova, who
spoke yesterday in Forbes Quad.

Klimova blamed years of the
government’s economic control
for the stagnation of changeover
from a planned economy.

“Czechoslovakia has had strong
government involvement in all
aspects of the economy.\Even the
Soviet Union had a private sector.
In Czechoslovakia, 98 percent
was quasi-state or directly state
run. We have the least theoretical
preparation for change [of all the
Eastern Bloc Countriesl," Klimova
said.

According to Klimova, the three
phases of economic reform began
at the start of the new year. The
first phase is the deregulation of
prices and dismantling of the
command system.

“Czechoslovakia has had a

period of 40 years of
administratively fixed prices. It
ended January 1, 1991. The first
step in introducing a free market
is to deregulate prices, and they
are 90—percent deregulated,”
Klimova said.

Industry no longer is controlled
by government ministries,
according to-Klimova. “Factories
are no longer told by their
ministries what to produce, how
much to produce, who to hire or
what price to sell at,” she said.

Releasing the restrictions on
currency exchange is a second
phase of reform, said Klimova.
“In the past there has been limited
convertibility to [Czech currency].
Now Czecho—slovakian currency
is convertible to anyone. The
exchange rate hovers around 30
crowns to the dollar.”

Klimova said that one positive
aspect of the Czechoslovakian
economy is the lack of foreign
debt. According to Klimova, all
government accounts payable are
balanced by a $5 billion debt the

Soviet Union owes the Czechs

and another $1 billion loan

outstanding to Syria.

The current phase of reform is
the privatization of business. “We
consider it to be the most
important reform. Small business
has been put on auction. Eight
thousand small businesses have
been privatized. Another 10,000
will be privatized in the near
future,” Klimova said.

The Czechs have not seen
similar success in privatizing larger
businesses, according to Klimova.
“There are some larger industries,
which produce products no one
wants, which have been running
on private funds.

“The problem is that a lot of the
entrepreneurs have spent their
money on ﬂsmall business,”
Klimova said.

While the reforms have moved
the economy towards a free-
market system, Klimova said there
have been unwanted side effects.

“There was a sharp increase in
prices, which we called the big
bang. When for 40 years prices
were at a standstill, many rose
heavily. Subsidies for energy and

E heat were taken away. After

um pm NEWS, Thursday, October 31, "1991

January consumer prices
increased by 50 percent,” Klimova
said.

When bans of foreign products
were lifted, an inflow of foreign
products flooded Czechoslo-
vakian markets with imports, but
Klimova hopes it will help their
domestic industries learn to
compete.

“There was so much hunger
for foreign products that many
people splurged on the better
Western products. Hopefully
increased competition will
increase the quality of
Czechoslovakian products,”
Klimova said.

While Czechoslovakia is trying
to lure foreign investors into their
country, many have been
deterred until the present
democratic government has
proven it can maintain political
stability, according to Klimova.

Czechoslovakia has had a
democratic government since
President Vaclav Havel was
elected on Dec. 29, 1991, after
the Communist government
stepped down in November.

extending computer lab hours

that the last class at Pitt is over at
10:45, and the campus bus stops
running at 10:50?” she asked.
She wants weight—room
equipment up “into the weight
room as soon as possible.”
Kazmerski also wants a security
guard in the parking lot under the

Towers, where cars have recently A

Kazmerski, a former member
of Pitt Army ROTC, said she
disagreed with the Defense
Department’s policy of
discriminating against
homosexuals. She said she would
not protest a university action to
remove ROTC from campus if the
anti-homosexual policy was not
changed.

A Carnegie Mellon University
Navy ROTC student asked
Kazmerski if she had no loyalty to
ROTC, but Kazmerski responded
that her loyalties rested more with
anti—discriminati.on and the
Constitution.

 Masloffsets the 
  Mayor Sophie Masloff has begun a new crusade. But

 instead of creating a new baseball field or eliminating fire
5 houses, Masloffs latest plan just may assist residents of

Pittsburgh rather than anger them.
Responding to allegations made by The Black Contractors
Association that the mayor had not kept her promise

’ concerning the increase of minorities’ and females’ business

participation in the Pittsburgh Housing Authority, Masloff
yesterday ordered an investigation of the department.

A major concern of Masloffs iswhether or not the
affirmative-action quotas she set in 1990 have been
effectively carried out.

Last year Masloff stated that she wanted set minimum
goals of 25—percent minority participation and 10—percent
female by 1995. ‘

According to The Pittsburgh Press, Coady Bolden, th
president of the contractor’s association, although pleased
with the mayor's quick response, would like to see the
“authority move toward fulfillingthe goals in the executive
order.”

The BCA, however, claims that the housing authority
has not yet come close to meeting the mayor's goals. '

The Pittsburgh Press recently conducted a review of
HUD's authority records of the Pittsburgh office.

They found that of the “$21,068,822 spent on
modernization and management,” only 8.85 percent was
spent on minorities. An actual figure for female contractors
was not available.

It is now 1991, and these goals could.n9t{-possibly have
been expected to be met in only a year since’ the rnayor’s
original plan was announced.

David Washington,..ex_ecutive director of the Pittsburgh
Housing Authority, told The Pittsburgh Press, “I don’t
believe we're not in compliance if we don’t have 25
percent or 10 percent right now. Our track "record is as
good as any other government agency. There’s room for
improvement, a lot of room for growth, not only at the
authority but in government in general.”

The decision of the BCA to bring this situation to the
attention of the United States Housing and Urban
Development Department may be premature, but it was
also in the best interest of the minority and female
contracting workers of the city of Pittsburgh.

Masloff, however, should not have had to wait for the

. U.S. HUD to be informed of this situation.

If the interest she is now showing had been prevalent
‘throughout the year, she would have known’ of the
situation and the margin for improvement long before the
BCA took such action.

As the mayor of Pittsburgh, Masloff is expected to keep.

a close eye on such vital affirmative—action programs.

Her swift call for an investigation of these proposals is
to be respected.

Perhaps, with the findings of the housing authority,
Masloff can attempt to meet her original goals long before
1995.

Politics of semi-automatic weapons 

On Wednesday, Oct. 16, George Hennard drove

his truck through the plate—glass.window of a diner
in Killeen, Texas. He proceeded to kill 22 people
who had been eating in the diner. Finally wounded
by police, Hennard turned the

law, the United States had just become an
autonomous nation through revolution. Fearing
invasion, the government needed to keep as many
of the citizens armed as possible since the army at
that time was not extremely large

gun on himself. The gun he
used was a Glock-17.

In light of this" mass killing,
some of our congressional

David  
Roman

battle by a militia made up of
common citizens. Clearly, in this
day of huge military spending, a

representatives and, in general,
gun-control advocates all over the country are
calling for new gun-control legislation which would

ban assault riﬂes and clips which can carry. more i

than seven rounds. In fact, such a bill was recently
defeated in the House of Representatives. It seems
that the tragedy in Texas has sparked new interest
in the subject. ’ .

Is gun control legal? Good question. The Second
Amendment states, “A well—regulated militia being
necessary to the security for a free state, the right
of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be
infringed.” This seems to state that any regulation
of ﬁrearms is illegal, yet there has been legislation
passed before that controls or bans the purchase of
certain weapons. . _

Gun—control advocates will tell you that, in the
first place, the Second Amendment is outdated.
When the Second Amendment was passed into

citizen’s militia is rather
unnecessary. In addition, at the time that the Bill of
Rights was written, the firearm technology was far
inferior to today’s. How can this amendment,
whichwas geared toward muskets, single—shot
pistols and single—shot riﬂes, be used _to protect
ownership of semiautomatic pistols and riﬂes along
with multiple-round clips?

John Bryant, R-Texas, said, “The fact of the matter
is that nobody needs an assault weapon except
cowards and criminals and weirdos who have to
own [one] . . . to—feel like a man.” This follows the
popular view that the only legitimate reason for
private ownership of firearms, aside from the
protection of home and property, is hunting, and as
Rep.’ Butler Derek from South Carolina put it,
“These weapons are not for hunting; they are not
for sportsmen. We're led to believe that we need an

Abortion ‘solves no problems’

In a recent column Gary
Knapick uses the issue of the
death penalty to attack Steven
Freind’s views on abortion.

The - effectiveness and
legitimacy of capital punishment
is a worthy topic of debate, but it
is a separate issue from abortion.
Why? Beyond any doubt, the
preborn baby is completely
innocent, whereas condemned
criminals (when the judicial
system works correctly) are guilty
of murder.

I would also like to inform Mr.
Knapick that abortion itself is the
ultimate form of child abuse.
Moreover, according to the U.S.
Department ofHealth and Human
Services, child abuse actually
increased over 500 percent in the
nine years after Roe vs. Wade.
According . to psychologist Dr.
Phillip Ney, an expert in the field,
Canadian provinces with the
highest abortion rates have the
most child abuse, while those
with the lowest rates have the
least child abuse. l...l

Abortion solves no problems.

I It is a problem. Steven Freind is

not a public enemy; he is a public ’

friend.

Homosexual by choice

I applaud Gary Knapick’s
concise piece on Steven Freind. It
is always a treat to hear a
heterosexual man defend gays’
and women’s rights and point out
how these issues affect the civil
rights of all Americans.

One complaint —— Freind
believes that gays should have no
civil rights because they choose
to be gay.

I am a lesbian. I am not
homosexual by choice. My lesbian
friends — some have lost family
and friends while coming out -
did not choose to be homosexual.
We are all happy being lesbian,
but we did not choose to be.

Gary, you are right. Freind is a
danger to civil rights for all of us

——white, black, heterosexual men
and women, gay men and
lesbians.

Q

 
 
  

Halloween neurosis...

 

I hate -Halloween. I hate, hate, hate it.

“Oh, you’re no fun, Jenna,” you might
be saying. And you wouldn’t be alone.
There's something about this holiday that
everyone seems to like. Free candy. A
night of “boo and brew” or some other
“debauchery with a theme.” What more
could you ask for? ,

So why do I dislike Halloween so much?
It all goes back (doesn’t everything?) to my
neurotic childhood.

Hampden Elementary School, located
in the tranquil suburb of Mechanicsburg,
Pa., forces its students to engage in a
bizarre ritual known ‘as the “Halloween
parade,” where every child in the entire

school dresses in a costume and marches '

dutifully around the playground and the
parking lot. ‘ "

Parents who didn’t work in the afternoon
or who couldn’t last the day without
seeingJunior dressed up as a beige Crayola
crayon watched from the sidelines.

I never knew what the hell to be for
Halloween, but the night before the parade
the year I was in fourth grade, my mom
came up with the bright idea of me

I-dressing-up=aseMiss Piggy. (It was 1979,

and the Muppets were big stuff.)

 She made me a pink nose out of Bounce
dryer sheets and bought a cheap blonde
wig at the Rite Aid. It was a great costume.
Thanks, Mom.

But when I got to school, a nasty fifth-
grade girl with a superiority complex
laughed at me in the bathroom when I told
her what my costume was. That did it.

So I hid in the coat closet. That’s right,
the coat closet —— secure under the
bookbags and windbreakers.

But Mrs. Jacobs fished me out and
FORCED ME to trot around the parking
lot, faced with certain ignominy. I was
devastated. -_

And ever since then I’ve hated
‘Halloween. _

But it’s more than the fear of being

shamed because of a wanker costume. My
dislike of the holiday comes mostly from
the pressure ADULTS put on OTHER
ADULTS to dress up in costumes.
Halloween is for CHILDREN — that is,
SMALL children. ’

If Halloween had fallen by the wayside
as the obscure Druid ritual it is, my
boyfriend wouldn’t be harassing me to
dress up as something embarrassing and
go to some stupid Halloween party with

- him. And he is THIRTY—ONE years old, for

God’s sake! When does it end?

“What are you going to_ be for
Halloween?” is a question which, in my
opinion, is best asked to someone who
hasn’t learned how to write a five-
paragraph theme yet.

If there weren’t Halloween, degenerates
wouldn’t be tempted to insert razor blades
in apples or lace miniature candy bars
with poison. And Dear Abby wouldn’t
have to print explicit instructions every
year about how to avoid flammable
costumes and child molesters on All
Hallows’ Eve. The column space could be
used to console another woman whose
husband dresses up in ﬁshnet stockings.

And then there’s the night before
Halloween (Mischief Night or Devil’s Night,
depending on what part of the state you're
from), when juvenile delinquents smash
other people’s pumpkins or fling rotten
eggs at other people’s pets. Now THAT'S
something to look forward to.

But there are some good things about
Halloween, like the Charlie Brown Great
Pumpkin specials. Charlie Brown always
gets rocks instead of candy in his Halloween
bag. Now there’s someone you can relate
to.

So I leave you with this question: Why
do people want to be scared? What
masochistic tendencies lurk in the human
psyche that make people glorify in death,
decay and other unpleasantries like green
glow-in—the—dark masks dripping ooze,
when they could be doing something
NICE and PLEASANT — like dressing up
as their favorite’ Pulitzer Prize-winning
authors? Anyone know where I can get a

‘Sinclair Lewis mask cheap?

Tl/lIO‘I

Two weeks ago, KDKA—TV news
reported that Arnold, Pa., banned
Halloween. Those dirty dogs!!! I couldn’t
believe this. I called the station the
following week, and Halloween was still
off.

From the news report it appears that
town officials do not necessarily object to
children trick or treating; it’s the parties
and other festivities that they want to
crack down on. Anti-Halloween fascists
live in Pennsylvania. ‘

Who could imagine an elected ofﬁcial
banning Halloween? It’s a tradition; for
whatever reason, it is part of an important
socialization process. Fear and terror are
subjects little kids must confront. Of course,
some children may become frightened by
Halloween activities. But the holiday gives
us a chance to confront these fears.

I can remember back in grade school in
the ’70s. I lived in Bellevue, and when I
walked home at night before Halloween,
the streets would be lined with glowing
orange globs of plastic. Plastic witches,
ghosts and scarecrows peeked out from
windows. _ ,

Dressing up for Halloween was never
my favorite activity. I never really liked the
store—bought costumes. They lacked
creativity. I preferred making r‘hy*“own

costume. Trick or treating never impressed '

me.

For, my first Halloween, my parents
dressed me in a store-bought devil outfit.
(How appropriate.) The next couple of
years, I dressed as a boxcar “bum.” It was
an easy outfit to pull off, and I made it

myself. In recent times, I dressed as a ,

monk," Akbar orJeff (you figu re out which
one I was) and George Bush. I enjoyed
creating costumes.But of course, my
favorite tradition is still carving jack-o’-
lanterns. My JOLS always had scary faces.
With great pride, I selected just the right
pumpkin for the occasion. _

But I really think Halloween should give
a good scare. Monsters, demons, goblins!
What else could a kid ever want? People
love fright. Halloween is a celebration of
the spooky.

Well anyway, I will always cherish these
memories.‘ Now it’s 1991. Halloween is
banned and even neutered. « '

Just a few examples:

Last Sunday I thought about buying

...or anti-Halloween fascism?

some fun and festive Halloween plastic
witches and skeleton cutouts for my front
door. I stopped in an Oakland card store
and found next to nothing. Then I thought,
“Phar-mor has everything.”

NOT.

Despair set in. When I was just a young
lad, our front door was decorated with a
mean, tall skeleton. Today, Phar—mor'had

door-sized cutouts of masked teddy bears I -. 

trick or treating with masked pink bunny
rabbits. Who would put that on their door?
What a letdown! . ‘

I -wandered throughout the store
searching for some real scary stuff. I found
cards with teddy bears wearing white

sheets. Ugh! This is not Halloween. This is " ._
wimpy assimilation. Everything is , ' '

becoming a Care Bear cartoon. I want

terror‘, fright and a mean old witch with an   '

evil snarl.‘
I left Phar—mor immediately.

Halloween is a tradition that mustlbe "

preserved in all its terrifying glory. For
kids’ sake, we must. Halloween was always
a special treat, especially since we were
allowed out of school early for it. Even the
teachers dressed up. Goingto grade school

with a teacher dressed as a witchwas  

always fun.

I got lucky in my search for a terrifying .

Halloween. Papermart had the terror that
I demanded. I ' V I

It seems that this yearl won’tbe deprived
of a wonderful Halloween. Unfortunately,
the kids in Arnold should start a revolution._

On Devil’s Night, I'm sure the kids are not ’

happy and will take the appropriate actions.

I think that I will make my own statement I

largest pumpkin in the Strip District. In
their honor, I will make the meanest jack:

These arguments miss several
important points, however. First
of all, speaking about the
Constitution as outdated is the
equivalent of saying the “Mona
Lisa” is too old or the ancient
sculpture “David” is not

I'€pI'€$€_I'llI_3.[lV§ Of today’s man. _

Some things are timeless, and
the Constitution is one of these
things. Barring the addition of
several amendments, this
document has survived 200 and
is as relevant today as it was the
day it was written. The problem

is that people today have.
difficulty interpreting it correctly. '

When the Constitution was
ratified, the new country did

- fear invasion — a fear which is
' almost nonexistent today, due

to the collapse of the Soviet

Union and the strength of the

American military. The reference
to a “well-regulated militia,”

however, contends with a more
deep-seated fear of the American
people. This phrase indicates

something different than the

Minutemen we all read about in
elementary history books; it
means a well—armed American
citizenry in general. Put this
together with the rest of the
Second Amendment’s wording,

and you find what the authors
were really attempting to guard
against: tyranny. The writers of
this amendment had just escaped
such a situation through
revolution and realized that the
American people would not
subject themselves to a new
government without some way
of protecting themselves from a
similar situation occurring again.

In addition, they realized’ that j

through their own revolution,
they had set a precedent for
future revolution in such a time
that the American people find
themselves oppressed by a
despotic government. Thus, the
modern American citizens
should ‘have this way of
protecting themselves as well.
Those of you who say that
tyranny can never happen here
should wake up. That is certainly
a naive attitude; human nature
dictates that anywhere power-
hungry people have a chance to
grab power, they will. The sad
truth is that most politicians are
not out to help their fellow man.
They are out for power.
-Some of you will say that
revolution is never the answer,
but it will invariably be the same
ones who called for the release
of -Latvia and -other small
republics from the Soviet Union.

Our right to overthrow a corru pt
and unjust government is
precedented by the American
Revolution, and our ability to do
just that must not be infringed
upon. A _
It is true that today’s weapons
are much more advanced than
those of the late 18th century,
but that is not the point. At that
time the most advanced personal
weapons were available to the
militaryand citizenry alike. The
riﬂe was far more accurate and
advanced than the musket, but
Congress never passed a law‘
against the riﬂe. If the army is
allowed access to assault
weapons, semiautomatic pistols
and multi—round clips but the
citizens are not, what happens
to the citizens’ ability to revolt
should the need arise?!
I ﬁndit odd that those people

against infringement of their First
Amendment rights would ﬁnd it
appropriate to allow
infringement of another
amendment’s rights. Don't they
realize that when one law that
steps on personal liberty is
passed that others will follow?
As Rep. Richard Schultz of
Pennsylvania said, “Let’s not
blame the gun andgthe’ gun
manufacturer for the illegal and
inappropriate use of an
inanimate object.”
What happened in that diner

in Texas is a tragedy, but to use \_

that as a reason to deny

Americans the right to form a -

.“well-regulated militia” would
be a tragedy of equal or greater
magnitude. J ._ «. S

Portland to repeat as champions of Paciﬁc

By Brandy L. Simms
Stajf Writer

The NBA’s Pacific Division
features some outstanding
players, like MagicJohnson, Clyde
Drexler, KevinJohnson and Chris
Mullin, just to name a few. Last
season the Lakers went to the
finals, where they lost to the
Chicago Bulls. Can they regain

7 their Magic? Perhaps. It won’t be

easy, though.

One of the league’s most
talented teams is the Portland
Trail Blazers. They finished the
regular season with an incredible
63-19 record. But the big question
here is whether they can duplicate
that feat. They have everyone
back. The leader is undoubtedly
Clyde “The Glide” Drexler. He
led the team in points last year
and averaged nearly 22 an outing.
In fact, Drexler was the only
player in the entire league to
average better than 20 points, six
rebounds and six assists per game
during the regular season.
Drexler’s backcourt mate, Terry
Porter, is no slouch, either. He
dished out a team-high 649 assists.
He also canned 150 three-pointers
and had 158 steals, both team
highs. In the frontcourt, the
Blazers have a solid group that
includes three veterans: Kevin
Duckworth, Jerome Kersey and
Buck Williams.

Du ckworth has shown dramatic
improvement over the past few
years and has blossomed into

one of the league’s top pivotmen.

He was named to the All-Star
team for the second time last
season and has improved his
defense and rebounding. Portland
will need consistent play from
this man, who is, at seven feet
and 270 pounds, one of the

biggest players in the game today.

Jerome Kersey and Buck Williams
provide the Blazers with two of
the league’s most versatile
forwards. The 6-7 Kersey is as
good as cmyonewhen it comes to
finishing the break. He’ll jump
over, around and through
defenders in an effort to get to the
basket. Williams contributes with
his ferocious knack for
rebounding. The veteran Williams
(6-8, 225) led the team in
rebounds, with 751 (9.4 rpg) while
leading the league in field-goal
percentage (.602). He also earned
first-team all-defensive honors.

Off the bench, Portland should
get help from forwards Cliff
Robinson, Mark Bryant and Alaa
Abdelnaby. Veteran guards
Danny Ainge should also
contribute. Let’s face it; this team
is loaded. Rebounding,

athleticism and team chemistry
are strong suits. If everyone stays
healthy, this squad will go far.

How far? Guess.

The Los Angeles Lakers return
five capable starters and should
contend for the division title. Most
notable among the starters is
obviously Magic Johnson, who
returns for his 15th NBA season.

This year’s Lakers team isn’t as
good as the Pat Riley-coached
teams of the 1980s, but they still
are capable of going all the way.
It will have to start with Magic,
though. As he goes, so do the
Lakers. They can ill—afford an
unlucky 15th season by the Magic
man. Byron Scott provides the
outside-shooting that is so
desperately needed in this league.
Forwards James Worthy and Sam
Perkins are both experienced and
give the Lakers a deadly low—post
attack that many teams will find
hard to defend. Yugoslavian
Vlade Divac posted some solid
numbers last year. Divac (7-1,
248) led the team in rebounds
(666) and blocked shots (127).

Elden Campbell saw action off
the bench during the playoffs.
The Lakers are hoping he’ll be
able to back up Divac, and if he
quickly develops into a solid
contributor, it could spell trouble
for conference foes. Not since
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar retired have
the Lakers won an NBA title.
Could this be the year? Wait and
see.

The Phoenix Suns have
already seen the daylight, but
will they shine again? Kevin
Johnson and Jeff Hornacek will
work wonders in the backcourt.
Johnson is one of the league’s
best point guards and deserves to
be mentioned in the same breath
with that other guard who bears
the same surname. Last season KJ
led the team in points scored

VS

(1,710), assists (781) and steals
(163). Since Cotton Fitzsimmons
took the helm during the 1988-
’89 campaign, Phoenix has
averaged nearly 55 wins a season
but have failed to win a division
title. A frontcourt nucleus that
includes Tom Chambers, Mark
West and Dan Majerle will be
looking to change that. Chambers,
at 6-10, can get up with the best
of ‘em. However his scoring
average dropped last year to 19.9
from 27.2 the previous year. He’ll
need to regain his shooting touch.
If he does, the Suns could be
primed for another run in the
Pacific.

Most NBA teams rely on a
dominant big man for help. But
how do the Golden State
Warriors spell relief? The trio of
Chris Mullin, Mitch Richmond and
Tim Hardaway —— also known as
“Run TMC.”

Those three were the highest-
scoring trio of players on any
NBA team last season and
averaged 72.5 points per game.
Golden State’s offense averaged
116.6 points last year, second-
highest in the league.

This squad won 44 games a
year ago and surprised a lot of
folks by eliminating San Antonio
in the first round of the playoffs.
Everyone returns, and they’ve
added rookies Chris Gatling and
Victor Alexander. They also
drafted Shaun Vandiver, but he
jumped ship and has signed with
an Italian club. The addition of

DATE TICKET LOTTERY

To be eligible you must have a student ticket and valid Pitt I.D.

Gatling and Alexander will beef
up the frontcourt. Gatling is 6-10
and weighs 220. He averaged 21
points and 11 rebounds last year
at Old Dominion. Alexander (6-
9, 265) pumped in 23 points and
hauled down nine boards at Iowa
State last season.

Tyrone Hill and Alton Lister
provide the team’s rebounding
firepower. Lister collected 485
boards last year. However he
needs to score more points and
grab more rebounds if Golden
State is to be a factor. Hill must do
the same. Soviet Sarunas
Marciulionis provides spark off
the bench. He made 97 three-
pointers last season, a team high.
. But the key here is definitely the
performance of “Run TMC.” If all
three are healthy, this club should
make it past the first round of the
playoffs, but the lack of a
dominant big man will prevent
them from going much farther.

When Xavier McDaniel roamed
the Seattle Center Coliseum
hardcourts, he gave fans plenty
of excitement with his ferocious
monster slams. The X—man has
moved on, but Shawn Kemp is
the latest installment and has
picked up where McDaniel left
off. However the Seattle
Supersonics will be without the
21-year-old boy wonder for a
while. He’s been sidelined with a
foot injury. Kemp is without
question the player of the ’90s,

Pitt volleyball whips Zips, 3-0

By Ryan Buncher
Stajf Writer

Pitt volleyball took three games
to zip by Akron last night in three
games, 15-13, 15-3, 16-14.

It was the 13th win in 14 games
for the Panthers, raising their
record to 196. Akron is now 16-
12. Pitt had only a slight advantage
in hitting percentage, .276 to .267,
but had a major advantage
defensively with 84 digs. The
Lady Zips had only 58.

deﬁnitely has talent. It was ousted
by Portland in the first round of
the playoffs last year. They’re
hungry, and they want to get
back into postseason play.
However they must once again
prove that they belong there.
They ﬁnished with a .500 record
last season and should be even
better this year. The guards are
solid. Gary Payton needs to raise
the level a notch higher if the

Pitt returns to Big East

asclose as any team in the Big

However he must recover from a
knee injury that will keep him
out of the lineup for a few weeks.

Smith is a versatile player
indeed. He averaged 20 ppg and
8.2 rpg a year ago and was one of
the team’s best foul shooters
(.793). He also led the Clippers in
blocked shots.

“Charles is reallygonna have a
terrific season,” Coach Mike
Schuler said. “He’s really worked
awfully hard in the off-season,
and he’s made a lot of progress.”

Until Smith returns, Schuler will
probably go with a starting lineup
consisting of the following
players: Glenn “Doc” Rivers

(whom they acquired in a trade
with Atlanta) and Ron Harper at
the guards, forwards Danny
Manning and Loy Vaught, center
Olden Polynice. There are so
many talented players on this
squad, it’s ridiculous. Gary Grant
and Bo Kimble are big—time
players who should see lots of
playing time. The Clippers also
picked up veteran center James
Edwards (acquired from Detroit
for_Ieff Martin) and drafted rookie
LeRon Ellis in the first round. A
year ago, this team won only 51

games. This year they may win
between 55-40, but don’t expect
much more than that.

Sampson always seemed to have
knee troubles. So the
Sacramento Kings recognized
that he wasn’t getting any younger
and bought out his contract. The
Kings will likely be going with
second—year player Duane
Causwell in the pivot. Causwell,
who played college ball at
Temple, averaged 6.9 points and
5.1 rebounds last year. He will
obviously be expected to build
on those numbers. He will be

Anthony Bonner and Lionel

nine rebounds a contest. Veteran

for merit and leadership.” He
said he has spoken with ﬁnancial-

aid director Betsy Porter, who is

“very enthusiastic about having a
group of students meeting with
her and assisting each other.”

The SGB should work closely A

with the city to increase the
number of police officers in
Oakland, hesaid.

Pasquale supports the North
Oakland shuttle and computer
lab. “Considering the amount of
money we pay in tuition and
other fees for university services,
the least we should expect is
safety,” he said. '

In response to student concerns
about parking, he said the
university owned a lot of unused
land in Oakland which possibly
could be used for parking.
-SGB member Gil Golden,
running unopposed for SGB

president, pledged to continue ‘

his work in the Crime Stop
programs and other projects
started by this year’s board.

He stressed his service to the
university through his work in

‘ SGB. “I feel that I have made at

least somewhat of a difference in
my involvementlon the board,”
he said. -

He said the proposed black
cultural center is necessary, but
the BAS needs to report back to
the SGB with information about
how the center hasworked on
other campuses.

Students’ votes for president
are important even though there
is one formal candidate, Golden
said.

“I plan to do my absolute best

» to safeguard our interests and to

obtain your vote to make me our
next student government
president. Please do not deny me
your vote just because no one is
challenging me. Your vote and

your endorsement may provide‘

[change on campus]  Plus, they’ll
make me feel good.”

He has toured solo with his
guitar, solo with a piano (even a
_full-length album on SST of

While other Burmanian
drummer Peter Prescot has taken
his Volcano Suns down a path
similar ta Burma, using the ballad
structure although tacking into
bizarre and surreal imagery; Miller
has developed a new outfit, titled
No Man.

The Brothers’ Stooge.

Then again, No Man isn't really
new.

Some of us get stuck in our
own mire of their familiar. We

roams the streets of Paris with an
all—male gang of killer outlaws
forever in search of the stuff they
need to tick. And of course, this
time something goes wrong. After
a massacre that would put
Schwarzenegger to shame, Nikita
is hauled off to prison and given,
if not her rights, her options: Kill
or be killed.

The character of Nikita (played
convincingly enough by actress
Anne Parillaud) is what gives the
film its charm in the midst of its
bloodthirstiness. She is in
contradiction with herself. She is
ruthless and kills without remorse
one minute and is a sweet
(although not totally innocent),
little girl the next. We see Nikita
training in karate and getting
stomped in the process,ibut we

are sure our heroine will
overcome, and she most certainly
does. Mind you, it is not her
success that is interesting, but her
method and the charm that shows
through her childish surprise at
her own success. Don’t get me
wrong. Nikita is a character that
knows how to wear the right
color lipstick. This film leaves no
lack of style; even the police are
dressed in Versace and Georges
Marciano.

She learns to play on her
sensuality to woo everyone from
grocery—store clerks to fellow
assassins; But since she
supposedly has beauty and brains,
Nikita is always put to the test.
She is quite sure of her duties and
how to go about them, but it is
her hesitation at crucial moments
that pushes a moviegoer to the
edge of the seat. Truly, this is a
force that drives this otherwise
predictable and melodramatic

action thriller. What will she be 7

left to do next?

This two-hour French import is
inconsistent in its acting, as the
actors let us feel their pain with
frightening reality and then come
frightingly close to doing Gloria
Swanson impersonations in
unrealistic yet tres baute

costuming. But the film is
consistent in its action. (Nikita
never gets a moment’s rest.) But
right when you think you’ve had
enough of the melodrama and
are bored with knowing the next
line before it’s been said, your
attention is sucked back into the
action faster than you can say,
“l’ll be back.”

Take my advice: Don’t take this
film seriously, and you’re in for
the ride of your life. Even O07
knows there’s nothing more
dangerous than a babe who packs
a pistol — and nothing more
provocative. Nikita is no shrinkin g
violet. I

Any spandex-clad pansy can
do his hair up and pose on some
sort of androgeny—is-pain
platform. But no matter how
confused he is (or I am), no one
is ever gonna forget that the
phallic guitar neck he’s stroking
is nothing more than a colossal
exaggeration of ~what he’s got
between his legs. He’s not in
pain: He’s in love with himself.

Lately it’s taken an onslaught of
psycho-cum—Lizzie Borden female
rock ‘n’ roll to inject us with a
much—needed cap of TOUGH to
help lay (figuratively) that
embarrassing cock—rock spooge
to rest. Call it Foxcore — some
reviewer already did, and it sticks!
OK!?! '

Paying homage to Richard
Kern’s knife-totin’ Lungleg and
Sonic Godmother Kim Gordon,
the whole scene has spawned
such noise—slinging supervixens
as Babes In Toyland,
Motor(maiden)head-harpies L7
and the Vivians.

resounding howl from the

Continued from page S-1
tenor Ernie Watts. Keepin’ time
and rhythm, “Yes, my man, Ron
Carter, is on the bass,” while Alan
Dawson plays skins. Kenny
Barron is on the ivory, and Eric
Gale, advertised as the funkiest
guitar in jazz, pulls strings. On
trumpet, Cuban Arturo Sandoval
scorches, and Mike Mossman,
musical director of Out of the
Blue, will provide ﬂavor.

A The star of this show is jacquet
(pronounced like he is French,
not Jacket), whose robust,

' majestic tenor blew onto the scene

in 1942, when he stepped to the
microphone as a member of vibe-
guru Lionel Hampton’s Big Band.
Jacquet quickly became a star

" among the big-band and early

bop scene, lending his lyrical
saxophone to such outfits as Louis
Armstrong’s, Charlie Parker’s and
Lester “Prez” Young's. He
provided the soulful horn to
complement Billie Holiday’s

smooth voice. Later he fronted
his own bands and co-headlined
record—breaking tours with Sarah
Vaughn and Ella Fitzgerald.
Jacquet has been around the block
more than a few times, playing
with basically every great of his
time.

“Critics once scorned his freak,
high-note effects only to embrace
them a generation later, when
adopted by the post—Coltrane
avant—garde,” said Musician
magazine.

Jacquet is the last of the great
swing—era, tenor-saxophone
titans. He is the last of the hard-
blowin’, big-toned, burly, full-
bodied, Texas tenormen. And
jacquet keeps going.

“I feel more inspired now than
at any other time in my career,”
Jacquet said.

Another killer saxman, who’s
been around a different block, is
Watts, whose tenor has been
heard in studio recordings with

Whitney Houston, Aretha
Franklin, Diana Ross and the
original Big Daddy, Barry White.
His steady associations include
the Tonight Show Orchestra,
which he has worked with for
over 20 years now, and bass-boss
Charlie Haden’s Quartet West,
which also featured drummer
Lawrence- Marable. Watts also
joined the Rolling Stones on their
1981 world tour and has won two
Grammy awards: 1982’s Best Pop
Instrumental for “Chariots ofFire”
and 1985’s Best Rhythm and Blues
Instrumental for “Musician.”
Although Watts has played with
many differentstyles and people,
he said, ‘‘It’s all one direction. lt’s
all one music and one energy,
just a matter ofplaying the music
I like well.”

Bassist Carter is a god. He
played in the awesome (forever
remembered)Miles Davis Quintet
of the mid-60s with Davis, Wayne
Shorter, Herbie Hancock and

including work on the brilliant
Coohin’ At Yhe Plugged Nicleel
sessions from Chicago.
Recently, Carter dropped bass
tracks ‘on New York rappers A
Tribe Called Quest’s latest wax,
The Low End Theory. Leader Q-
tip wanted to use a live bass for
the recording and found as perfect
compliment in Carter, whose bass
webs wonderfully in and out of
the mellow Tips’ lyrical fountain.
Carter, who is renowned for his
acoustic bass work, is also the
inventor of the piccolo bass,
something you might want to ask
him about at his seminar.

Alto Crawford is yet another
veteran of jazz greatness and has
recently worked with organist
Jimmy McGriff on various albums.

If you haven’t'heard of any of
these cats, don’t fret. You can
actually talk to these immortals
as they deliver their own seminars
dealing with their instruments
(except Jacquet). If meeting the
legends doesn’twetyour appetite,
there are also various seminar/
lectures dealing with everything

from the music business to music
and medicine.

Of course the highlight of the
week is Saturday night’s bash at
the famed Carnegie Music Hall,
of which Davis has to say, “jacquet
is a proven legend. Put him on
stage with a young turk like Mike
Mossman and the funky guitar of
Eric Gale, and you’ve got
explosive chemistry.”

Explosive and more—— the 21st
annual one—of—a-hind jazz
seminar and concert features a
lecture this morning aboutMusic
Medicine in the Assembly Room,
hosts seminars on Friday and
Saturday at various times in the

Saturday evenings shindig at the
Carnegie Music Hall at 8 pm.

Any band that used to share
practice space with Gang Of Four
is worthy of attention. But that’s
not the real reason why The
Mekons are gettin’ press. The fact
is they're a pretty good band. Just
ask the Village Voice. Greil Marcus
voted Fear and Whisleey, the
band’s 1985 LP, the best record of
the decade in his Real Life Top 10
column. Some people think they
are a great band.

They've been around for quite
awhile. Forged from the same
late '70s anarchistic—punk era as
the Sex Pistols, The Fall, The
Damned and all those other anger
bands of the period, the Mekons
sound comes off mu ch differently.
So do their views of those days of
years past. “The things the Sex
Pistols said in interviews  were
more interesting than the sound
of English punk music,” said Jon
Langford, one of the group’s two
remaining original members, in a
recent issue of Option.

The name Mekons comes from
a comic book entitled The Eagle.

-The enemy is called the Mekon.

who had a “big, green head and , .
sat around in a flying saucer and --

wentaround doing evil deeds,”
explains Tom Greenlagh, the
other founding Mekon. It’s no
surprise the Mekons chose the
villain of the comic for their name;
they’ve been bashing imperialism
for years, including on FearAnd

Whiskey, which was an album 
about “England and the Thatcher .
Years and about the miner’s- 

strike,” says Langford.
Back to the Gang Of Four
scenario: They appeared on the

‘back cover of their maiden

release, 1979’s The Quality Of
Mercy Is Not Stmen. On 1982’s

The Meleons Story, the band 

began ﬁddling around with ﬁddles
and more traditional instruments,
something that has stuck ever
since and distanced them from
other punkers of the period and
definitely expanded
audience.

, In ’88, So Good ItHurtscame out The Mekons will make tl1eir first ‘appearance ever in the area Nov. 6

on the American Indie label Twin/
Tone; then The Mekons landed
their major label dealon A&M
Records, and the band was
exposed to the horrors of
American corporate dealings.

“They didn't have a clue vléhar
they were doing,", says
Greenhalgh. Still, A&M kept with
the Mekons and released the 1990
EP, F. U.N. '90. The record was an
out —of-tune, rythm-heavy re poste
to the Manchester dance-craze
scene that was swarming both
continents. . ‘

That’s where the relationship
halted, as A&M dropped the
Mekons, which resulted inrthem
being picked up on a full-time
basis by England’s Blast First label.
The result: 1991’s The Curse Of
7heMeleons. The LP features such
stellar tracks as “Blue Arse,” a big
production number with. a
whirling, synthesized horn
throbbing over a rapid drum beat,
and “Brutal,”,an airy, haunting
diddy with hand clapping and
banjo for effect.

helped in perpetuating it.

The film itself trades from
black and white to color
throughout its entirety. Concert
footage is in color for obvious
reasons, and the more personal
backstage moments are in black
and white, maybe for not so
obvious reasons. (Apparently
it was meant to add, possibly,
a more mystical—yet—gritty
realism quality. Godar would
love it.) It exposes the
contradictions in Madonna’s
life.

The black and white is
relevant in that these segments
seem to salute Madonna’s soul
sister, Marilyn Monroe. These‘
moments resemble newsreels
or other documentary footage
on Marilyn: a good amount of
‘grainy, wel1—lit, nicely framed
scenes of a person who was
highly sexually charged, carried
a lot of power, yet was utterly
vulnerable and lonely behind
the myth. _And one thing
Madonna does in this film is

 

create her own myth, or at least
seal her fate as such;

One feels sorry for her, as she
has purposely put herself into a
position and teeters on the crest
of it. (But through the course of
this highly electric film, one
wonders how much acting
Madonna has decided is
necessary. Even in her
“vulnerable” moments, she
appears as a cinema verite
model.) That is the contradiction
in the film. . I

The film itself is jampacked
with tidbits of backstage life;
the risqué antics enjoyed by
Madonna and crew. But how
much of it is Madonna? Warren
Beatty, making an involuntary
guest appearance, even goes so

« Spain) — all the fixin’s for a

far as to say to Madonna that he
believes she cannot exist
without being in front of the
camera, and to an extent this
appears true. Madonna is
“herself” in front of the camera,
but that self, like Marilyn’s, is in
the foundation stages of her
own myth. The process is loaded
with Gaultier, street fashion,
other “stars,” paparazzi, theater
and film (with Almodovar in

circus. In other words, the amino
acids of fuel needed to rocket
someone to stardom contain no
looking back. Madonna exudes
fabricated beauty and an honest
wickedness (as in demonstrating
her method of fellatio). But
where does this get her?

In this ﬁlm it gets her the
“Marilyn syndrome.” Truth Or
Dare “exposes” a person
trapped in her own stardom,
and truthful or not, it seems she
is given few options and remains
confined alone in her stardom,
doomed to perpetual
Showmanship. ,
