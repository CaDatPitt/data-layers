Cafeteria Now Serving  

:I‘uck Shop Style Snacks

I

New changes in the University’s cafeteria service are pro-
viding more variety in students’ lunches.

A "single-item counter” opened Monday morning in the base-
ment cafeteria for the convenience "of customers who want one
or two hot dishes but not the regular full meal.

Complete hot meals will still be
sold on the Bellefield side of the
cafeteria, but single items only will
be sold on the Bigelow side Monday
through Friday from 9 a.m. to 1:45
p.m. and from 2:30 to 3:30 p.m. Mon-
day through Thursday.

Short Orders

The new service is mainly for the
student who now buys only one or
two small items in the cafeteria,
according to Ruth Cramblet, director
of the University Food Service. Those
who want to buy just a little will
now get more variety, stated Miss
Cramblet.

Among the items featured on the
new counter will be soup, hot sand-
wiches, hot dish features such as
baked macaroni, casseroles, and
spaghetti, and beverages and des-
serts. A limited assortment of cold
sandwiches and salads will also be
available. ‘

Coke Machine

Another addedfeature ofthe base-
ment eating-place is a new Coke
machine from which the student can
.buy coke, cherry, lemon-lime or root
"beer soda for 5 cents.

The new system is not meant to
replace the Tuck Shops or the regu-
lar cafeteria service, emphasized
Miss Cramblet. Both Tuck Shops
and cafeteria service will be con-
tinued on their regular schedules.

PLACEMENT BUREAU

All men students graduating in
ebruary who have not already
egistered with the Placement
ureau are urged to do so at
nce. Many companies will visit
e University to recruit seniors
is fall without regard to draft
1- reserve status. RegiSll‘at|0n
forms may be obtained in Room

809 C1.

Notre Dame

Tickets Going

Pitt will be. well-represented at
Notre Dame Stadium on Nov. 11,
as nearly all of the 300 tickets for
the Pitt Special Train have been
sold.

In as much as the game is a
complete sell-out at South Bend
and all the more expensive trips
to the game are also sold out, the
Pitt Special holds the only unsold
tickets to the classic.

Tickets may be bought at the
reduced rate of $15.39, which in-
cludes train fare and a student sec-
tion seat at the stadium.

The train will leave Pittsburgh
at 11:30 p.m. Friday, Nov. 10, and
will arrive at South Bend at 7:30
a.m. Saturday. Returning, it will
leave South Bend on Saturday at
11:30 p.m. and arrive home at 7:30
a.m. Sunday. ,.

Hamilton Plan Meets Approval

Dink Rules
Will Get
Teeth

Upperclass Court will work side
by side with Men’s Council this
year in an effort to keep a dink on
every’ freshman head.

The nine members of the court
each will be charged with a bit of
the police work and will each check
two freshman English classes in
the Cathedral.

They will station themselves at
the doors of the assigned classes
watching the freshmen as they enter.
If a given freshman does not have
his ,dink with him he will be asked
about it and warned the first time.

If, however, the UC Court member
thinks it necessary, the freshman’s
name will be taken and he will be
notified to attend the next session
of the Court. It will meet every
Thursday at 12:30 p.m. in 832 C1.

It is hoped that the Court will
have to work only in an advisory
capacity, however, according to
Roy Titchworth, president of Men's
Council.

Citing possible penalties for the
freshmen, Titchworth outlined one
plan which would send the freshmen
back through orientation classes
during the semester following.

The check will start Monday and
will continue at unannounced inter-
vals.

Upperclass Court is made up of
one representative from nine cam-
pus organizations. The members will
alternate as chief justice from week
to week.

ID Cards Due
By Saturday

Those all-important student iden-
tification cards are now being pre-
pared and will be ready for distri-
bution before the Panthers’ first
home football game Saturday. As in
previous years, the ID card must be
presented with the student activity
card for admission to athletic events
and other student activities.

The cards will be distributed in
the Commons Room from 9:15 A.M.
to 4:30 P.M. Oct. 4, 5, and 6. Stu-
dents should pick up their cards ac-
cording to the following alphabetical
schedule.

Wed., Oct. 4- A thru M

Thurs., Oct. 5 —N thru Z

Fri., Oct. 6- A thru Z not pre-
viously called for.

Students who neglected to be
photographed during registration
must have their pictures taken on
Friday, Oct. 6, between 1:00 P.M.
and 4:30P.M. in the Schenley Room,
first floor, Cathedral of Learning.

Graduate school students may
call for their cards in the Commons
Room also, but professional school
students should pick up their cards
at the offices of their deans, Oct.4
and 5. Ellsworth Center students
will get their ID photos at 103 Ells-

worth Center.

Two of the heads of Pitt Administrative Departments have

expressed their approval of the

new physical education program

proposed by Capt. Tom J. Hamilton, Athletic Director.
The administrators endorse the new program which calls for

all men students to attend physical
education classes one hour each
day, five days a week. An extra
hour would be required daily for
changing clothes and travelling to
and from the Trees gymn. This pro-
Vides, however, that the new plan
can be successfully included into
the current curriculum.

Col. Holland L. Robb, Director of
the Military Department, said that
he is "all in favor of it, if the nec-

Mrkonic’s

Gambling ;

Charges Set Off

Fireworks

A storm of protest met Emil Mrkonic’s charges of gambling

on the Pitt campus.
‘ Police Inspector Lawrence

J. Maloney, whose district in-

cludes Oakland, told reporters, “There has been no trouble with
Pitt students and I have had no complaints concerning football
pools, numbers writing and the like on the campus.”

He went on to say that he is proud to have the University in
his district and will give the school a “clean bill of health”

anytime.

T. W. Biddle, dean of men, said in last Friday's Pitt News,
"I have no evidence of any such gambling in operation at the
present time. If I had such evidence the University would have

can be made.”

Col. Robb added that the program
is especially desirable, if by its
existence other acti_vities- of the
University are not in any way im-
peded or curtailed.

"If it is going to be a matter of
discussion at a Deans’ Meeting,
that is where I would like to make
my statement, at this stage of the
game,” Dean Theodore W. Biddle
commented.

Owl Pictures

Being Taken

Seniors are urged by Editor
Leizer Balk to make appointments
to have their pictures taken for the
Owl.

Appointments should be arranged
as soon as possible at the Student
Desk. Photos will be taken through
out the month of October.

This year, as last, the job of
photography will be handled by the
Delma Studio of New York.

Copies of the Owl may be ordered
at the Student Desk or from any Owl

OWL CONTRACTS

Any organization which has
not yet received its contract for
pages in the 1951 Owl should
contact Rosalyn Ilirsh in the
owl office immediately.

College thinks that "it would be an
excellent thing, as soon as the pro-
per facilities, such as the new
fieldhouse, are available.”

Many Obstacles

HOWCVCB although Dr. Crawford
is "certainly in favor of the new
program” he stated that there are
many obstacles, such as schedule
difficulties, that have to be met suc-
cessfully before such a program
could be put into efficient operation
at the University of Pittsburgh.

The present phys ed program,
which calls for two hours per day
during the freshm_an year, falls far
short of adequacy, considering pre-
sent world conditions, the Captain
feels.

taken action to prevent it.”

Clarifies Statement

Mrkonic clarified his previous
statement that Pittsburgh colleges
"foster and promote football pools
and the like.”

"I am positive that no University
official would ever or has ever en-
couraged any forms of gambling.”
declared Mrkonic.

He further explained his earlier
statement by saying that "the na-
ture of certain courses gives the
students the idea that they can
beat the pools.” -

“[nteresting" - Biddle

Upon hearing Mrkonic’s new
statement, Dean Biddle stated, "His
reported change in attitude is in-
teresting. It is unfortunate and dis-
loyal to the University that for the

purpose of publicity, if that was ,

his reason, a University student
would make strong and damaging
statements, which he apparently
cannot support.”

Mrkonic intends to continue cam-
paign against the alleged rackets’
on the campus. He plans to put
his findings into the hand-s of the
local police.

Many Pools

Mrkonic believes the distribution
of the football pools at the Univer-
sity is done by an outsider or sev-
eral outsiders. He explained that
the students who sell the pools
get them from their hometowns or
places outside the University.

He says there are many differe.
pools in operation so it is obvious

. that they come from different sources

and that one man does not have
control.

In last November's
Mrkonic was elected constable in
the tenth ward of McKeesport. His
jurisdiction extends however over
all of Allegheny county. If Mrkonic
decides to make any arrests on the
campus, he would have to take the
accused party to the nearest alder-

' man.

Joints at Home

A high-ranking McKeesport police
official who wishes to remain un-
identified, said that there are "at
least two suspected numbers joints
in Mrkonic’s neighborhood, possibly.
more. Both have been under sur-
veillence by McKeesport police.

"There is also a ‘floating’ card
game operating in the tenth ward,
participated in by young small-time
gamblers. Police have been check-
ing on this outfit as well.”

A month ago, the Tenth ward club
of McKeesport was raided by County
detectives. The club is supposed to
have as its purpose the betterment
of the younger generation, to further
the aims of America, etc.Complaints
were made by neighbors that there
were gambling activities in the
club. Officers of the club were
hailed into the Qmnty Criminal court
on charges of operating a gambling
establishment.

  English Librarian Here for Year

By ISABEL L.[LBO...VSKY
Exc ange students from many

varied fields have been coming to
Pitt for a long time, but this is the
first time that the University has
had an exchange librarian.

He is George Stephen Darlow from
the University of Leeds, England
who has exchanged positions for
this year with Gertrude Kneil, regu-
lar librarian in the reference room.

On arriving in the United States,
Mr. Darlow spent a week in New
York. He’ was particularly impressed
with the automats, the squirrels in
Central Park and the bar tenders.

' Mr. Darlow who is working in the
reference library on the fifth floor
said "The reference room here at
Pitt is better than any I have ever
worked with in England.”

He was also interested in the
Alldred Room and remarked that
there were no such browsing libra-
ties in England. He considers these
"browsing libraries” very good be-
cause they “encourage students to
take an interest in wider fields.”

Received Classics Degree

Mr. Darlow, now living at Gradu-
ate House on Dithridge Street, re-
ceived his Master of Arts degree in
classics at Cambridge University.
His appearance seems to chime with
what most Americans think English-

said “I‘can’t see how there can be
so many cars on the streets without
many more accidents.”

Coming from Leeds, an industrial
city, Darlow commented about the
cleanliness of Pittsburgh even with
all its factories. One of the things
that he considered most outstanding

Cannin of Songs Does
Justice, Composers Say

“Songs of Pitt,” the Pitt Band-Glee.Club record album made
last spring, recently received the stamp of approval from the com-
posers and lyricists themselves.

The men who composed words and music for the songs Pitt
students know and love were sent gift albums during the summer,

and have replied enthusiastically,
according to William F. Saalbach,
assistant to the dean of men.

Colin C. Sterne. Six Pitt songs
were recorded on three 10-inch un-

Victor label.

According to Dr. Clarence 5. Th ongs were previously re
    a    

but the latest album is the only
one ever done of Pitt’s songs by
Pitt students. The album cover
was designed by Paul F. Lohmeyer
Pitt alumnus and former adviser to
student publications here.

Price of the album is $3.50,
if ordered by mail, $3.75. They
may be bought from Band members,

Crawford's Idea

The plan for exchanging librarians
with Leeds University was started
when Dr. Stanton Crawford, dean of
the college, was in England a year
ago last spring. While speaking to
the head of the library at Leeds, he
suggested the idea. When Dr. Craw-
ford returned he presentechthe plan
to the University Librarian A. L.
Robinson and official plans got
underway.

Mr. Darlow will return to Leeds
in June. He expressed hope that the
exchange librarian plan would con-
tinue because as he put it "it’s a
most-fruitful source of learning li-
brary work.

make and Fire
Much as we would like to applaud Constable Emil Mrkonic
for his announced intent of cleaning up alleged gambling on the
Pitt campus, all we can see is a lot of smoke and very little fire
in the Pitt senior’s charges.

Students do play the various football pools that operate dur-
ing football season. Some of them mark their choices in the Tuck

Shop after conferring with friends. But as far as we can discern,

the source of the pool sheets is nowhere near the Pitt campus;
rather, the students pick up the sheets from agents in their own
communities, and it is there that the bets are placed.

Over «such forms of gambling, the University has no more

.jurisdiciton or responsibility than it has on the backroom poker

games that some students undoubtedly sit in on around their homes.
To charge the University with responsibility for the fact that

students may use methods learned in classes to play the pools

is nothing short of ridiculous.

If Mrkonic has evidence of actual gambling on campus and is
sincere in his wish to break it up, his proper course would have
been to inform University authorities and local policeimmediately.

As it stands, his action in making his charges to the Pitt News
first, and his evident tardiness in enlisting the aid of local auth-
orities leaves him wide open to acharge of mere publicity-seeking.
* * * * * *

Whatever his purpose, Mrkonic has suffered from his premature
attack on what may be a non-existent evil.

Routine checking by the News on his story brought to light
evidence that the situation in Constable Mrkonic’s own district,
McKeesp.or.t’s Tenth Ward, indicates that investigation of possible

I gambling activities there might be more fruitful than a probe of

the Tuck Shops. Since Mrkonic’s pay comes from the pockets of
Tenth Ward citizens, his first responsibility is to them.
If the constable-student has the information he says he has,

I the University wants to hear about it. Otherwise, Mrkonic will do

better to confine his racket-busting to McKeesport and concen-
trating on getting into law school at Pitt.

Quality vs Quantity

The age-old debate about quality versus quantity might well be
applied tothe pep rally held Friday. Despite posters placed in the
halls and other strategic spots on campus and an announcement
over a local radio station,only an estimated two hundred students
(quantity) turned out to give the team a sendoff.

Most people who attended the rally expressed satisfaction with
the enthusiasm (quality) of the two hundred or so who were able,
orinterested enough to, attend. Several of the football players also
reported favorably on the rally. They said it was the best sendoff
they had ever had.

But the quantity seems to be entirely unsatisfactory when one
considers that there are an estimated ten thousand fulltime stu-
dents at theUniversity. The next rally should either be held at a
time when most students will be able to attend or the publicity
should be more intensive. Perhaps, then, the quantity will be im-
proved. We are certain the quality will be maintained.

 Peter John Gray

The Pitt News, along with the University, notes with real
regret the passing of young Peter John Gray, son of Dr. Peter
Gray of the biology department.

The boy, a prodigy in the same true sense that Mozart was
a prodigy, had a life of great promise before him. Possessing
great intellectual gifts, he had in addition a personal quality
that made all with whom he came in contact think of him as a
friend and equal.

The editor, who knew Dr. Gray’s son briefly some five years
ago, feels, as does everyone who knew him, that he has lost a
close friend. Nor do we think it maudlin to say that the world,
too, has_lost one who might have played a large part in its future.

While Pitt has stopped setting
records for enrollment with a de-
crease of about 10%, Penn State
is gathering in more and more stu-

students have enrolled at Mount

Dinks and frosh regulations again!
Any freshman who complains about
wearing a dink should peruse care-
fully the rules and regulations set
up at Muhlenberg College. Among
the
black bow ties, ID buttons, trouser
cuffs rolled ten inches from the
ground, and the carrying of a supply
of matches at all times. They also
have. to dress up in pajamas and
march through the streets of Allen-
town, in what is known as the “Pa-

requirements are class hats,‘

jama Parade.”

But the dinks and black bow ties
have stirred up a rebellion at State
College. After a week of customs,
freshmen let off steam by hanging
four dummies dressed as “hagmen,”
the upperclassmen in charge of en-
forcing the rules. "Hatmen” are

frosh dorms. The reason, water
bombs being dropped from the upper
floors of the building.

Another common problem seems to
be dances. At Ball State College in
Indiana, a columnist filled a few
column inches by letting off steam
about attendance at a Saturday night
dance. Let’s hope Student Congress’

columnists off the subject.

;~Epps ‘Engineered’ to Pitt

By SAM SPATTER
Chalk up an assist for Pitt's Engineering
Department in helping the Panthers gain one of
.. the more sought-after high school gridders from
Western Pennsylvania. - _
Bobby Epps, Swissvale High’s hard-plunging full-
" back, received bids from over 30 schools, but decided
,' on Pitt and its Electrical engineering course.

"Pitt presents a 4-year engineering program that
satisfied me best,” the husky freshman stated, “and,
of course, I'd rather go to school near home.”

Has the Weight

Bobby appears to have all the requirements for a
top-flight T fullback. His 190 pounds are well dis-
tributed over a 5-8 frame. He is a hard charger, but
can pass and could be used as an extra point kicker
and for kickoffs.

The frosh fullback’s ability, however, is not re-

averaged over a B in high school, having graduated
22nd in a class of 146. His activities in school, be-
sides football, included varsity basketball and presi-
dency of the Senior class. Quite a load for anyone to

second string all-WPIAL Class A squad. In 1948, the
school repeated its WPIAL record, but Epps improved
on his own by advancing to the first string all-star
eleven of his league.

During these years other rewards came to the
18-year-old fullback. He was awarded the B’naii
B’rith plaque for '48 and '49, won the Braddock
Free Press trophy in his senior year, was “most _
valuable player” for Swissvale in '48-'49, and com-  
pleted his high school football in the Dapper Dan-

Jaycee game last August.

Cas Considers Changes

In Defensive Baekfield

EN ROUTE FROM DURHAM '- Coach Len Casanova had two
problems to think over as he made the long trip home after his
team dropped its opener to Duke, 28-14, Saturday. In short, he
-had to find a pass defense and a fullback.

Pitt's pathetic pass defense

was the most glaring weakness

in the loss to Duke. The explanation went this way:

Halfback Armand DiFonso was clever but not fast enough
-- Duke receivers simply outshot him. Halfback Billy Reynolds
was fast enough but too inexperienced to keep from getting faked

out of his shoes. Safety man Bill‘
Sichko was adequate, but tiring
defensive duties
ere bound to af-
ect his perform-
ance in carrying
jthe brunt of Pitt's
ioffensive attack.

hoping that his
pass defense will

and as far as DiFonso is concerned,
some of the best defensive backs in
college and pro ball have been slow
afoot.

"He's our smartest back,” Casa-
nova has said of Di-Fonso.

In the meantime, though, the T-
mentor is considering making changes
in his defensive backfield. En route

End Chris Warriner somewhere in his
defensive backfield.

Warriner Agile

Warriner is fast and agile. In the
Durham affair, he was used mostly
on offense.

But in addition to his woeful pass
defense, Casanova had to ponder,
with melancholy, the state of the
fullback slot. The consensus of
opinion was that the injured ]oe
Capp, who was sidelined at Duke,
must be ready for next Saturday's

DURHAM, NC.

Flint Greene Makes :
A Little History

BY MYRON KOPELMAN
Sports Editor

-- Tackle Flint Greene heard the question,

but he did not seem particularly anxious to answer it.
I had been sitting there next to Flint when the thought sud-

denly struck me,

What is a colored fellow doing on this plane?

We’re heading south for a game in North Carolina. The colored

‘ don’t play down there.

“Say, Flint. You must be the
first colored boy ever to play down
at Duke,” I suggested, "Is that
right?” .

“Don’t know,” Flint grumbled,

«suddenly getting interested in the
‘ morning paper. "Don’t know much

about that.”.

Obviously, though, Flint did
know. For upon his arrival here
in Durham, it became evident at
once that Flint Greene’s coming
was no casual
thing. At the air-
port he was met,

carefully ‘precon-
ceived plan, by
an athletic coach '
of North Carolina
State College,
a nearby Negro
school, and dri-
ven off to spe-~
cial quarters at
that school.
Along with the rest of the team,
I went to the white man’s hotel,
whererl bought an afternoon paper
and found the headline: “Grid His-
tory in Making -— Pitt to Play Ne-

 

Greene

gro Against Duke Club.”

As a matter of fact, the story
pointed out that “this perhaps is
the first time a colored gridder
has played against any white

Back to 

college team in North Carolina.”

Dr. Hollis Edens, president of
Dike, and Head Coach Wallace
Wade signed a statement saying:
"We have neither the right nor the

desire to restrict or limit his (Len
participation

Casanova’s) team’s
‘on the grounds of creed or color.”

The statefnent was encouraging,
even if it did appear in the same
section which carried a story of
mob action against a Negro boot-
legger. The statement was indi-
cative 0.f a trend for the better,
a trend which will take further
shape when Pitt plays at Miami
U. next year.

Flint Greene got into the ball
game in the second quarter. The
Blue Devils immediately ran a play
at Flint. He stopped them cold.

Whether or not the play was em-
ployed for dishonorable purposes,
nobody outside the Duke huddle
will know. But after the game,
Greene reported that nothing raw
transpired in the line play that
afternoon.

As for Flint’s performance
well, he played his usual brand of
ball -- no less vicious, no more

vicious. Through the whole Dur-
ham affair, as a matter of fact, he
conducted himself admirably.

If you like fancy comparisons,
you might say Flint Greene was
the Jackie Robinson of North
Carolina football.

is one of Pitt's busiest places.

Oscar Kapff, the Lost and Found Department's genial and
patient manager for the past three years is kept equally busy

running it. Mr. Kapff’s task of re-

turning the countless and sundry
items that students lose, forget,

, misplace and mislay, within Pitt's

environs, is a full-time job. A
report just issued by the Lost
and Found Department verifies
this fact.

During the 1949-50 school term,
19,132 transactions were handled
across. Mr. Kapff’s desk and in and
out of his well-jammed lost and
found closet. The in-items (lost
articles turned in) for the year to-
taled 7,878. Out-items (articles
returned to owners) totaled 5,416.
An amazing record of 70% of the
lost items was returned, the report
stated. Inquiries (articles asked for
but not in the department) reached
an equally high total of 5,838.

May Biggest Month
Mr. Kapff’s department did its

obi gest business last May. During

the month, 2,731 separate transac-

tions were handled. Included
were 1,149 in-items, 803 out-items
and 779 inquiries as to goods
lost‘.

Biggest single day was May 11,
with 157 transactions.

The 1948-1949 season was al-
most as bad. Mr. Kapff labored

719,132 LOST ITEMS - Losing and finding is getting to be a Big busi-
ness. Mr. Oscar Kapff, the ground floor guardian of lost treasures here
at Pitt, has a full-time job trying to retrieve lost objects and trying to
"lose” some of those which have been turned in.

Lost and Found Office
I Kept Busy All Year

 By JAY AUSLANDER
Unknown to many students the Lost and Found Department,
located in the Post Office on the ground-floor of the Cathedral,

 

  

over 18,733 transactions.
Most astounding is the amount of
money lost and found, Mr. Kapff

says. Last year he returned 252
purses, containing $1,076.87 in
cash, plus important cards, to

happy owners

Library books form another big
item. Volumes returned totaled 254
for the term«.

“Fibber McGee” Closet

The conglomeration of other
items stacked in Mr. Kapff’s clo-
set is as amazing as the amount.
Included in the array are gloves,
“babushkas”, notebooks, brief-
cases, jewelry, pens, pencils,
erasers, freshmen “dinks” and
assorted hats, mufflers, shoes,
umbrellas, overshoes, keys,
fraternity and sorority pins, and
dozens of other items.

Retrievement of many lost
items is done through Mr. Kapff’s
"Collection agencies”. These in-
clude the Tuck Shops, the cafe-
teria, department offices, the in-
formation desk and elevators.

To the student body Mr. Kapff’s
constant plea is: “Finders turn in
items promptly; losers - don't give
up the search too quickly.”

“lt’s a tough job,” he says.

BEHIND THEIPRODUCT

D|SCOVER_Y WHILE SHAVING.
To a certain Alcoa metallur-
gist, the past few weeks’ re-
search seemed futile indeed as
he faced his mirror one morning
in the late twenties. This prob-
lem was a sticker: Army and
Navy planes demanded a new
kind of aluminum; just as
strong, but far more impervious
to salt spray and weather . . .
Suddenly, as he squeezed the
last bit of shaving cream from
the tube, a message ﬂashed.
He wrapped the empty tube
around his ﬁnger. Yes . . . a

Hastening to the laboratory,
he tried out his new idea. It
worked! Tests proved it to be
everything he hoped it would
be. Then he collared the boss
roller in Alcoa’s sheet mill.
Quickly, he explained how this
new, more useful form of alumi-
num was to be made. “Can you
roll it, Dan?” the metallurgist
asked anxiously.

“Sure we can roll it!” grinned
the big, capable man in over-

BECAUSE FREE COMPETITION demands constant improvement,
Alcoa stockholders backed this metallurgist and his fellow research-
ers, until their perseverance found the answer. Others stood ready,
in plants, sales offices and management, to introduce the new Alclad
products. After 18 years, this better product is still creating new jobs,
and helping America toward better living, in home, farm, and in-
dustry. Seems like a good system for all concerned. ALUMINUM

almost pure aluminum, was
slamming through the shining
rolls. It grew wider, thinner at
every pass—a sandwich, weld-
ed by the tons of pressure into
a single unit. Finally, there
emerged a new, protected kind
of aluminum sheet. We called
it “Alclad” Aluminum. And it
came to be a mighty factor in
America’s air power. Most mili-

tary and civil planes wear this
strong shining skin.

We learned to make it into
rods and tubing, even to draw it
into ﬁne wire. And thus, among
many other things, a better
kind of screening was born.

 

 

 

Day Nears

Highlight of this year’s High
School Day willbe the football game
with Rice Institute at the Stadium,
Saturday, Oct. 14.

In high schooldays of other years,
a dance at Syria Mosque topped off
the day’sactivities. But the mosque,
now undergoing alterations, will be
unavailable for the post-game dance.

The High School Day Committee,
a specially-appointed faculty, ad-
ministration, and student group,
was unable to line up a suitable
alternate location for the dance, ac-
cording to Theodore Vi". Biddle,
chairman.

In addition to the football game,
visiting high school students will
have an opportunity to attend cer-
tain conferences and clinics sched-
uled for High School Day.

YM and YW
Camp Meets

"What Does God Require of Us
at the University” will be the theme
of the YW-YMCA conference Oct.
6, 7, and 8 at Camp Carondawanna,
Fombell, Pa.

Dr. William J. Scarborough, presi-
dent of West Virginia Wesleyan Col-
lege will be the main speaker. Al-
fred. C. Payne, director of the Pitt
YMCA will lead one of the panel
discussions.

All interested students, whether
members of the Y or not, are urged
to register for the conference at
either the YM or YW office.
