University Five Adrninistrators Get New Positions

For Site

_ Greensburg, one of the Uni-
versity’s regional campuses,
acquired a 104-acre, 31-room
estate as the probabfe future
 site of an administrative

‘ building, student center and
. library. ,
 t The former -Charles McKenna
Lynch estate ‘will be surrounded
by new buildings for classrooms
and laboratories-, a separate li-

brary, a gymnasium and a dormi-
tory according to the expectations

of Chancellor Edward H. Litch- ‘

ﬁeld.

The Greensburg campus opened
in September 1963 with an en-
rollment of 486 students‘ who took
one or more courses. In Septem-
ber it is hoped that the enrollment
will nearly triple with the addi-
tion of graduate courses in li-
brary science and education and a
series of graduate-level seminars
in business in the evening.

‘ Estate to Open in 1967

The new site should be ready
for occupancy in September 1967
but Dr, Litchﬁeld hopes to ‘move
some student‘ and administrative
activities to the new campus by
1966. Until. then, the. downtown
Greensburg campus open for al-
most a year is housing the under-
graduate and graduate day and
evening classes.

President. As a result, he wrote a
letter to the Times expressing his
views. The Times replied than an
article concerning Presidential ap-
peal to the public_ would be inter-
esting,i and asked Schulman to
write such an artirle. ‘

Believing that Kennedy didn’t
go to the people often enough,
Schulman sugyests that Kennedy
wasn’t very pushy because he
tics. Kennedy was a. “politician's
politician” which means that he
was looked upon as a familyman,
scholar and millionaire, not just
as a leader. . '

"creates popular pressure and tries
to 'push the nation into concern.
He is going to the public through
press conferences and tours which
aim for public support which
Johnson hopes will pressure Con-
gress. He hopes to arouse the pub-
lic support needed for congres-

_ sional approval and aims for re-
' election also. ‘

There are two sides to this
issue of approval to the public
as there are two sides to every-
thing. The other side of this
issue is -- Can the President's
appeal to the public lead to suc-
cess? This question concerns
what Schulman calls “the mass-
es as 9. sleeping progressive
giant that needs only to be
aroused to demand . forward-
looking legislation.” . ‘

 Editorial: Flusli of Success

Last week’s success story in the ﬁght‘ for improved facilities for
handicapped students has also set the tone for a healthier relationship
between student leaders and the administration. '

When a group of students took stock some weeks ago of what the
administration had not done in this area during past year, Dr. Alan Rankin
immediately picked up on this interest and called a meeting not only
of the administrators and faculty involved but also of the campaigning
students.

Within three weeks, at one hour meetings each Tuesday, the joint

committee reviewed the suggested‘ modiﬁcations and ‘examined them in
light of the priority list contracted by a group of handicapped students.

Dr. Rankin and Captain Liles Creighton, assistant director of the

physical plant, then met with the men fromthe City who proved to be
‘open to the project as soon as the technical plans are drawn up and the
funds contracted. ’ '

A Dr. Rankin stated that he would arrange for wooden ramps over certain

steps on the ﬁrst ﬂoor of the Cathedral on a trial basis. And the group
listed in priority ﬁve curb cuts to ease access between the Student Union,
the Cathedral, and Clapp Hall. '

Dr. Rankin also announced that he was contacting Mr. Edison Mont-
gomery of Policy Planning and Co—ordination to draw up an oﬁicial Uni-
versity statement as to policy -in this area. At this point he would then
have policy backing to solicit funds for the curb project. Here, he hoped,
something might be accomplished by fall. - '

The success of this interaction has symbolic overtones that go,
beyond the handicapped area. A group of students hasvattacked a problem.
of concern to them and has presented concrete proposals to an open and
interested group of administrators. The action was immediate when the
two groups synthesized in view of a common goal. The air is freer after
this healthy trial of co-operation, and hopes for a_ communicative year

By the last meeting, handles had already been secured to the out-
side of the ﬁre doors onto Lily Court, as the Committee had suggested.

The Popular Singer). . . C -

Not A Screamer
  is By Marvin Zelpkowifz

Many criticize the popular
rock and‘ roll singer. They
criticize the singers for b e i n g
yellers rather than singers. They
criticize popular singers for not
being. able to
read sheet mu-
sic. These same
people also cri-
ticize P01311131‘
singers for" be-
ing unable to
play musical
instruments.

In some cases,
-these criticisms
m a y be valid.
In the case of Lesley Gore, how-
ever, they are unfounded. And
Miss Gore is not an exception to

the rule of popular singers.

M First, she is not a “yeller.” Her
songs have not been popular be-

cause she yells them out. They
have been popular because they
have a style, and because they
are pleasing to the ear of the
audience between the ages of S12
and 22. V
None of Miss Gore's songs

have been screamers. This is
not to say they are classic.

 

They don’t presume to be. But
people like to listen to them.

Among her six million records
sold, Lesley Gore has two mil-

. lion sellers, “It’s My Party,” and

“You Don‘t Own Me.” Her other
single sellers have been “Judy’s
Turn to Cry,” “She’s a Fool,”
“That’s the Way Boys Are,”_ and
“I Don't "wanna Be a Loser.”
Because she doesn’t want to be
a loser in the music world, Les-
ley Gore takes Voice lessons. She
has been taking them for close
to two years. So when she stands
before a_microphone and repeats
the lyrics and tune to a song,
she is] singing, not yelling, ‘L or

panting, or raving, or shouting. ' '

In addition to being able to
sing, Lesley Gore understands
the theoretical side of music.
At least she impressed" the
graduates of the Duquesne
School of Music who have
summer jobs playing in Ken-
nywood Park’s band.

“That‘girl has a good head for
‘music on her shoulders,” one of
the music teachers explained.
“She really‘ knew how to handle

that rehearsal.” The rehearsal

‘ was before Lesley Gore’s show at

Kennywood Park (Sunday, June
21.)

“Her arrangements were tre-

mendous,” the teacher continued
“She didn’t do all of the work
herself, but she knew where to
make the changes that would
complement her way of singing.”

According to Miss Gore’s

father Leo, music did not come ~

naturally to his daughter.
“Les never played piano by
ear or anything ‘like that,” he
said. “She had to practice.
And she \has been working at
music since she has been a
little girl.”

According to Mr. Gore, Lesley
now plays several instruments

. with relative "ease, including the

piano and the violin.

Lesley Gore is now a success-
ful popular singer, in spite of
the many critics of the trade. In
spite of them, she has‘-had a
great deal of success. But she is
not satisﬁed with her current
success.

Lesley Gore aspires to be
either a jazz singer or a Broad-
way singer. She still feels in-
adequate, however, when it
comes to jazz singing and
drama. For these reasons, she
will attend the Sarah Lawr-
ence School for Girls this fall,
and major in either drama or
music.

If Lesley Gore_.majors in mu-
sic, it will not be to learn how

to sing, but how to apply the-

ability she already has.

No Tops And Frisbies
Bylarry Bemfeld

Summer weather means girls sunbathing on the inner quad-
rangle lawn. Sunbathers provide an interesting diversion for the
Dormitory Frisby teams as they sail their orange circular discs
across the cement expanse which separates the dorm steps from
the quad lawn. . '

Each year the summer sport changes —— but the girls don’t.
This season, nationally reknowned bathing suit designers have
plotted some far-reaching changes in the ‘form of the female’s
bathing suit. Thesechanges in swim-suit design might, in turn,‘
revolutionize the (two main summertime sports at the University
—’— namely girl watching and Frisby playing (in that order).
V Conventional swim-suit design calls for a top, a bottom,
and a pair of straps. The new, ultra 1964 design, simply
A eliminates _one of these conventions —- the top.

In the era WT (with tops) star Frisby players ﬂexed their

biceps and overshot their opponentsso their Frisbies landed on ~

the inner quad «lawn. Though no scientific research has been
conducted in this area, it is a reasonable assumption_that the
length of the Frisby shots were often a function of the number
of girls sunbathing. ‘ V ,
If the topless bathing suit fad is adopted by University
coeds (as was the hula hoop‘ andthe madras skirt), it could
result in a consumer shortage of Frisbies. More and more
non-athletes would purchase Frisbies in hopes of learning
the game. ' ' ' A

This could be disastrous, because Frisby playing is the
number one summer sport. With no Frisbies available, hdw could‘
our athletes keep in shape for their less strenuous fall and winter
sports (football, basketball, etc)?

The repercussions of the topless bathing suit on the Univer-
sity’s prestigious national sports rating then becomes obvious.

, Our athletes will not havethe Frisbies necessary to over-
shoot their opponents and give them a legitimate excuse to
gain the extra exercise obtained ‘from the lengthy ‘walk over
to Sunbathers’ Lawn. This wind sprint makes all the differ-
ence between lazy ﬂab and healthy muscle tone.

Comes the fall and winter, and we will be forced to play the
KQV High Hoopers in basketball, and Carnegie Tech in football.
We’ll lose our invitations to the Tangerine Bowl and, the Sun
Bowl. The National Ratings. will carry a special also-ran cate-
gory for the Frisbyless University of Pittsburgh.

To avoid future calamity, there seems to be only _one_-,
alternative. Beano Cook, athletic publicity director, must
make like Carrie Nation and chop down all department and =
clothing stores selling the no-top swim suits. 4

If Beano can accomplish this, then the co-eds would have
no choice but to remain part of the Era WT (with tops), the
athletes would not have to worry about a Frisby shortage, and

consequently, they would be’ in shape for the lesser fall and ~

winter sports.  - f

See You At Intermission . . .

By Wayne Cloeren

The hero of The Carpetbaggers, played by-

George Peppard, is a dare-devil businessman who
is ruthless and successful enough to make J. P.
Morgan or Cash McCall look like the corner grocer.
This study of a tormented but capable jack and
master ofall trades is the latest movie on one of
America’s favorite subjects —— money. Generally
speaking, all types of situations, comic or tragic,
are more interesting to those in the “affluent .50-
ciety” if they concern people who have money to
spend or burn. .
This time "the spending, both in the story and
in" the production, gets ’out of hand. The hero,
Jonas Cord, Jr., starts with a small mining busi-

- ness and winds up owning all manner‘of corpora-
Ations from airlines-to movies to plastics to elec-.

tronics. This theme starts off well but goes on and

on until it becomes boring.

Peppard Is Well Cast
George Peppard, a capable as well as good-'look-
ing actor, is well ‘cast as the tycoon, movie pro-
ducer, engineer and ﬁnancier. He treats his women
-the same as he treats his corporations. Money is
no object, but love or personal commitment is

"taboo. The story of why and how he lives as he

does is an interesting one, but in this version it is
too long byabout one hour.

There are just too many companies, too many
women and too much money. Despite a good
cast-and a good production, one is more than
ready to leave the theater after two and a half
hours of uninterrupted spending.

Although Jonas Cord is mean and inhuman, he
is always ‘successful in his ventures, both business

and romantic. One begins to wonder when the
reckoning will come. ,
Jones, Sells Out in Time
. It would have ‘satisﬁed logic as well as ethics
had his ruthlessness met with some sort of justice.
But after facing a childhood fear (Freud will out
even at the last minute) and a baptism of ﬁsti-
cuffs, Jonas wises up. He sells out in time and‘
settles down with the “right girl” and just enough
money to live spendingly ever after.’ B
In addition to Peppard’s good performance,

. there are excellent portrayals by some old timers

_ and some new personalities. Elizabeth Ashley is
appealing but still human as the right girl, while -
Carroll Baker is equally‘ ﬁne as the wrong girl.

The veterans are ably represented by Alan
Ladd, turning in the last and one of the best per-
formances of his long career, and by Bob Cum-
mings with his amazingly innocent manner and
famous Cummings laugh.
Casting Is Outstanding
The casting in general is the outstanding feature
of the movie. Lew Ayres is ﬁne as usual and Archie
Moore, the grand old man of boxing, hangs up his

-gloves and does a minor role well.

If The Carpetbaggers had been ﬁlmed with a
little more intelligence and a little less money, it
could have been quite good. But with all the situa-
tions and characters, there are too many loose ends.
The" producers of the picture, like the hero of the
story, were too eager to use money rather than the
time and feeling which would have made the ‘pic-
ture more effective and concise. See you at inter-

because the time for the bill is
now._ The’ pressure is on the bill
because the average citizen says
that he is in favor of the bill
though these people probably will
not live next to a Negro or prefer
to go to school with a Negro.
Difficulty Due To Pressure

The pressure ' on the Civil
Rights Bill makes it harder to pass
becausesof the tension on the pre-
sentesituation. The Southerner is
in daily contact with a Negro
whereas a northern white c a n
make it easier for outbursts of
racial tension than in the sepa-
rated ghe-ttoes of the North.

The Civil Rights Bill as the ex-
ception to the ruleof pressure not
forcing Congress to pass a bill
isn’t thereal problem. The hard-
est thing for a President is to gain
the people’; attention. The United
Statesis basically “an unpolitical
people” according to‘ Schulman.
Apathy is the foundation of sta-

‘Probably one of the most
questions facing
the male undergraduate is

rwhat to do about his military
-service obligation.

“Every able-bodied male-
from the ages of 17 to 26 is
subject to a six year military ob-
ligation,” explained,Lt. Col. Ben-

' jamin Hollis, th e Univer;sity’s

Army ROTC Professor of Military

S Science.

This obligation usually consists
of two years active duty in one
of the three branches of service
and four years duty in the re-
serves.

Two years of reserve time are
served in the Ready Reserve. The
reservist is required to spend two
sessions a month training in addi-
tion to two weeks of summer
camp a year.

The ﬁnal two years are spent
in the standby reserves as a
civilian with no additional mil-
itary training. The reservist’s
name is merely kept on record
in case he is needed.

In times of crisis the Ready Re-

'serves are normally called be-

fore the Standby Reserves. “But,”
added Col. Hollis, “everything
has its exceptions.”

_ With this military obligation
before him how does the aver-
age student prepare himself for
it? The most obvious and popu-
lar device is to try to dodge the
draft. After all, the theory goes,
nearly one-half of all youths avoid
service altogether by one means
or another.

To this kind of reasoning the

V Colonel replied, “Unless you are
' 4-F or mentally or physically

unﬁt for service, your chances
of avoiding the draft are slim.”

After" the late President Ken-
nedy’s executive ord e r placing

list in their classiﬁcation cate-

“Better for two years than for

the service by getting married. —
“This order,” Col. Hollis said,

“essentially defers married men.‘

but is no guarantee that they
won’t go.”

Even a conscientious objector
is required to serve two years
in constructive civilian work,
such as hospital work, and a
paciﬁst (one who refuses ’ to
register) faces up to ﬁve years
in prison or‘ a $10,000 ﬁne.

The facts seem to indicate that
all males, including students,
should make some provision for
their military service.
can prepare for his service is by
becoming an oﬁicer through the
ROTC program. In his letter
recommending r e s e r v e ofﬁcer’s
training to, incoming fresh-
men males, Chancellor Litchﬁeld
said, “Consider . . . the waste
inherent in a college graduate
satisfying his military obligation
through serving in an enlisted
capacity.”

In discussing the ROTC pro-
gram at the University, Col.
Hollis pointed out that for lib-
eral arts students all 14 ROTC
credits are counted for grad-
uation (for engineers it’s two)
and a deferment of up to four
years is given for graduate work
taken before being called to ac-
tive duty.

Non-ROTC students are also
deferred. while they are in school
but they should have the Office
of Student Records send an of-
ﬁcial form to their local draft
board stating that they are in
school.

More Bucks Than Private

The ROTC graduate must spend
two years on active duty, as does
everyone else, but he serves as a
2nd Lieutenant with ofﬁcer’s pay
and privileges; ”

“about"75 per cent of our grad.-
uates enter the branch of their
first choice and over 90 per
cent enter one of their top three
choices.”

Even with ROTC, some people’

think that military service cuts
off‘ two years earning power. Does
it ? '

The late Benjamin Fairless,
president of U-.S. Steel, said of
those who had spent two years
as an ofﬁcer, as against those who
had not, “the over-all advantage
will probably lie with you in the
long run.” Mr. Fairless felt that
the leadership, experience, train-
ing and responsibility woulclibene-
ﬁt the oiﬁcer by obtaining him a
better position and a better salary
in civilian life.

The ﬁnal question to be asked
is whether or not the draft is
going to be abolished. ,

The current study on the draft,
according to C01. Hollis, will not
have an effect until the l970,s.
“The Army,” he explained, “needs
volunteers. This is the only rea-
son we have a Selective Service
System. We get volunteers be-
cause of the Draft.”
" “Americans,” he concluded, “are
an insurance minded people. We
insure ourselves so that we can
have an effect until the l970’s.

Army is insurance for the whole.

country.” ,

Is this insurance worth taking
two years outpof a young man’s
life? “On the ._contrary,” feels the
Colonel, “it may add two years
to the life of his country.”

Sociology Prof...
Gives Talk on
Romantic Love

Dr. Howard Roland, associate
professor of sociology at the Uni-
versity, discussed the concept of
romantic love before a small audi-
ence in Tower A, in the fourth
and ﬁnal Men’s Dorm Council

lecture series on “Man’s Relation
with Woman,” last week.

The concept of romantic love,
Dr. Roland said is a peculiar one,
and limited to certain societies,
being particularly strong in the
United States. Romantic love
which Dr. Roland deﬁned, as
something one idealsizes, but re-
mains inaccessible, is fairly recent
in history, but highly contagious.
The US. exports it to other cul-
tures through movies and "litera-
ture and it catches on quickly.

Audience participants r a i s e d
questions concerning a growing
ambivilance towards love ‘ as a.
result of barriers set up under

and cited as an example the addu-
lation of the Beatles with their

young girls.

Read Eric Fror'nm~ =

In answer. to audience "ques-
tions directed toward free love
and love “as the neurosis of the
atomic age,” Dr. Roland suggested
reading various books by psycho-
analyst Eric Fromm. ’

Dr. Roland outlined three basic
types of relationship between hu-
man beings. Companionship is

-the simplest of the three forms

andthe rarest. In this form there

fulﬁllment of one party’s wishes.
This relationship c an also be
found between man and book or
man and dog.

Friendship, the second form "is
more involved, based on a plane
of equality. Love is the third and
most complicated form and the
most recently, created form of
togetherness.
