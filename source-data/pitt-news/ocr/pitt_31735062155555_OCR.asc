ii More Responsibility _
This year and in previous years

' all three publications have had ed-
itors and business managers with

equal power. Under the new plan
there will be greater centralization
in the organizations and anincrease
in responsibility of the executive of
the Owl and ‘Panther. The three
departr ents of the Weekly will be
co-ordinated by the. advisory board
and elevation, of the.
nianager, will ‘result in more re-
sponsibility on this officer. E

In making -the changes the publi-
‘cation board did, not condemn the
present system as inefficient. How-

. ever, it is believed the new plan will

facilitate a smoother operation of
all publications and give each o 1__-
cer a better opportunity to devel "
his department. The .ofl’icers, who
were selected will choose their own

Notice, Weightmen!‘

Coach Shea has .~issuo‘d an .
urgent ' call for freshman and
varsity weightme'n.. The track
team is exceptionally weak in
its shot putting and -javelin,
discus and hammer. throwing
-departments. Anybody who has
had any experience in high
school oigwho possesses any
’ kind of ability in then ath-
letic lines has a wonder ul op-
portunity to make the team.
Here is a chance to earn a let-
ter and bolster the team. ,

Since Montgomery has gone
to the coast, the teamis With- . <
out a hammer thrower- Other
weight heaving , divisions are
equally as bad olf.“

Prospective iavelin tossers v
have some excellent tutorage in
store for them. 0. Bessey, who
was Rocky Mountain Confer-
ence javelin champion for Mon-
tana State a few years ago, is
assisting Coach Shea.

 

AWAIT OPENER  

Time trials for ‘fresh tracksters
‘are scheduled for "Monday and
Tuesday of next week, in prepara-
tion for a. dual meet with .Kiski
prep school inlthe stadium, Wednes-
day, May 7. Coach Shea will hold

 

the watch on runners trying’. out‘

for distances from ’ the
dash to the mile. run. '
The Kiski meet was moved up
from May 17,’ by an arrangement
-made this week, and will be the
‘opening number on the proigram for
first year. men. Other! contests
scheduled include dual meets with
Penn State fr-osh ‘May 10; Carnegie
Tech plebes, May 14; and West Viri-
ginia freshmen, May 24. -
The Kiski-Pitt frosh meet last
year was a‘ triangular affair, the
Penn State freshmen also compet-

100-yard

ing in it and incidentally carrying ‘

off most of the honors. .Kiski was

well represented in the dashes and

the Jquarter-mile by. Bill Miller; the
Washington High“ ﬂash, by Vance
in-’ the hurdles, by Abbott in the
broad jump, and by Schmitt in the
Their combined effort
‘netted a second place in the trian-
gular competition. '" '

This‘ year Kiski should be just
as strong, ‘for Simms, a Mononga-
hela High school star, will‘ re re-
sent the Saltsburg boys in the ur-
dles and in the broad and high
jumps ‘as well. Gosnell will par-_
ticipate for the prep school in the
weight events and should make a
better than average showing.

Pitt, on the other hand, has a
very doubtful aggregation to carry
its colors, all departments but the

a distance runs and the jumpsbeing

of unknown quantity. In these, Pitt
has Jim Watkins, a 2:00 half-miler,
and 4:40» miler; Nick Palliwadi“,
Mitchell. Bernstein and John Clise,
all of »whom can run the half-mile
under 2:10 and the mile well under
ﬁve minutes. - . V “
1 Tom Savage is the leading candi-
date for a. ‘hurdle position; Becker
is a likely javelin heaver; and Reil-
ly and Holtzman are trying‘ for the
quarter-mile. The ‘hig jump and
broad jump can be well taken care
of by Cornell Cooper former‘ West-
inghouse high school leaper and in-
terscholastic high jump champion of
the United States. “Coop”
over twenty feet in the broad" leap;
and, of course, he is consistent in
clearing more than six feet in the
high It is doubtful that he will be
required ..to try any height over six
feet this season. ‘ ’ . _ -

Weight men are getting . in ‘ as
much practice as‘ ossi le,—. Luch,
Cuba, and’ Cutri, al taking their
workouts" with the shot and the dis-
cus. ‘ The sprint department ap-
at present, with
Miller being the
Kiski star is a sure first place win-
ner in boththe -dashes. ‘ ‘

the 10th, regarding p ‘us for the
‘football game here next year be-
tween Pitt and Western Reserve.
Am mighty -glad that Pitt is play-

". lng here, as’, the area should gooveir

big. We will cave no, stone un-
turned to work up interest with the
Cleveland public and the Pitt alumni
in this section. ’ » _ _ ‘

‘There are possibly a couple hun-
dredgraduates in C eveland, and we
will see that they are‘ circularizea.
with ticket notices. We will also

« coverthe Greater Cleveland district,

and Akron, Youngstown, Warren,
Painesville, Ravenna, Lorain and all
surrounding towns. I think’ this

would be a fine opportunity for the
alumni of Pitt in this section to get H

a large organization started, and I

y will be glad to co-operate with

George Carson in this connection.

WOOLDRIDGEO. TO

LEAD MERMEN

Thirty-six hungry mermen, were
banqueted at the Faculty club by the
University at the close of the
Panther swimming season.‘ The
Harry Q. Taylor trophy was award-
ed to Captain Fred Wooldridge, who
was also appointed captain for next
year. The frosh mermen selected
John Hanna as‘ the honorar year-
ling captain. Both Hanna an Wool-
dridge were well deserving. of the

lcaptaincies which theyreceived‘, and
their selection was well received- ,

,,Don Harrison and Jock Suther-
land both praised swimming as a
sport, and Jock said swimming, was
more of a sacriﬁce than football.

Much praiseawas given to Pat Corr,

swimming coach, for his method in
coaching. Pete‘. Bowen said that
Corr was the ﬁrst man to teach him
how to work_ and was thus respons-
iblefor his success "in track. ' ‘ ,

' Bus. Wright, former] Panther
merman, was toastmaster and did

very well in’ introducing such speak- .

ers as Henry‘Blum, A. A/. U. official;
Rieserdorf, Tartan swimming coach;
Clark Marshall, member’ of ‘ Pitt’s

lﬁrst swimming teams, and Eddie

Jacobs, tennis star. All the, mem-

bers of the team were given a chanc‘e

to talk, and every one praised Pat
Corr as a ﬁne fellow and -coach. ,’ ‘

Don Harrison presented varsity
letters to the following boys: Wool-

dridge, ‘Steffen, Swensen, .Mana.ge‘r_

Rosenberg,-Jackson, Harper, Under-
wood, George and Schmeiler. The
frosh who received. numerals were:

58y CHARLEY ‘HYATT °-231°

Several of Pitt’s basketball admir-
ers gathered to‘ do homage to the
Pitt basketball team of 1929-30 at
the Faculty club last Wednesday.
The selection of Eddie Bakef and

.year’s team was the feature‘ of the

as well as good ‘sports. Their selec-
tion will, no doubt, prove very pop-_

 

Continuing last week’s discussion’
on improvements to be made at Pitt,
I can present further ideas on the
beneﬁts *’of a ﬁeld house which can-
not be underestimated. The various
reforms or remedies I have suggest-
ed or will suggest in the past and
future all «tend, to bring to the eyes
of those in power the need for these

improvements and a ﬁeld house. I am

not criticizing anyone for the obvi-
ous drawbacks in Pitt athletics; but
I am trying to ‘bring. Pitt up to the
front in all sports. In the last few
years, the scholastic standing of the
Univers' has been brought to the
highest standards, of which the
Cathedral of Learning is the symbol.
To getback to the business at hand.

 

Tennis is a losing proposition just
as track, swimming and riﬂe are.
Yet the publicity-and championships
derived from these teams and ' the
competitive relations with various
colleges more than warrant the ex-
pense of .maintaining them. The ten-
nis courts are inadequate, the sched-
ule is very mediocre, and the trips
are nil. The publicity for these sports
is. far below par. Otheruniversities
have wrestling, boxing, crew,» la-
crosse, baseball, and othep, competi-
tion on their sports’ programs.,They
lose money, but the schools seem to
beneﬁt-= in many ways.‘ It's all right
to advertise football; deservedly so,
for it is the means of supporting the
-other sports and paying off the
stadium debt. Tennis teams have al-
ways had a great success in compe-
tition and have carried Pitt’ pres-
tige to the East and West. The
swimming team has done the same.
Let’s not, for the sake of a few dol-
lars _let down on the good schedules,
pub icity and material. Itiwill pay
in the long run, I’m sure. Incidental-
ly, among his other innumerable
duties, a_ssistant- director Hagan has
become the part-time coach of the
tennis team. Eddie Jacobs, varsity
captain, does a good deal of the
coaching, necessarily when J im’s at-
tention is" devoted to other work.

“Doc” Carlson’s cagers are now in;

the midst of spring practice. Leech ‘

is the by-word with Doc this year.
Last year it was Johnnie Brown; the
year before Anderson. By this is
meant that Carlson lectures one man
in particular each year. It's all in
fun though and everyone gets’ a big
kick out of it, even the culprit.

 

Thectrack team had a tough day

a ainst Ohio" State. ‘Ohio has a great ‘

a 1-around team this year. Bowen,
Knobloch, Utter-back, Harris, Jerpe,
Vitulla, McConnell . and Caesar
scored all the Pittsburgh points.
Simpson and Rockaway held the
spotlight for State. They had plenty
of help from their teammates, es-
pecially in the ﬁeld events.

This week, Coach Shea will take
-his relay team to the Penn Relays,
where they have a very goodchance
of copping the mile. Bowen, Knob-
loch, and U-tterback will participate
in the special events.

 

The last two weeks of football will 1»

bring‘ to a close the ﬁrst session of
Dr. Sutherland’s new coaching staff.
If I am a good judge of football,
Pitt will be right up there when
championships are considered next
fall. The results are due to hard-
working Dr. Sutherland and his
great all-American staff. -

 

Here are the various candidates
for the basketball team. These are
the ones with the most promise:

Forwards-—“Phil” Aiello, “Al”
Wrobleski, “Tip” Kowallis,
Rodgers, “Sandy” Sandberg, “Milt”
Cohen. . I

Centers—John Bro_wn, “Lefty”
Leech, Don Smith, “Freedy” Fried-
ler, Andy Anderson.

Guards—Eddie Baker, Willie Ar-L

ture, Rocco_ Cutri, “Fatty” Lewis,
“Tim” Lawry, “Doc” Kowallis.

 

The junioncolleges will send many
good men to Pitt. Included are Al.-
bright, six feet-four, center from
Uniontown, and Delello, dribbling
guard from Johnstown. A

As usual, the centers are few and
far between, but Eddie Baker can
jump center if need be. Rodgers can
play bothguard and forward equally
well. Smith-can play guard with the
best of them. Arture can play for-
ward, too. Versatility will be the
keyword of this year’s squad.

 

Tentative first-string lineups of
great potentialities follow:
First-—Wrobleski-F, Milt Cohen-F,
Brown-C, Baker—G, Ariture-G.

Second--Cutri-F, Arture-F, Al-I

ibright-C, Baker-G, Smith—G.
Third —— Wrobleski-F, Arture-F.

Baker-C, Smith-G, Doc Kowallis-G. .,

 

Thus you may see that the Brad.
dock doctor has‘ every right to be
optimistic about next year’s sched-

ule. An undefeated team isnot im- '

George“ is favored to beat Pete

ter two. Utterback is also ‘en-
tered in ths gdecathlon; but due to
the fact that he has been unable

/

‘The basketball seasorr’ was just
ﬁnished at Pitt a few Weeks ago,

his boys racing down -;;the stadium
ﬂoor, again. When his call for
spring training was issued, twenty
boys’ answered’ and Fagre ready to
make their bids for next : year’s
team. * ,
Dr. Carlson expects to keep the
boys at the ﬂoor‘ game for about
two weeks justato get an idea of
what he has in storefor next sea-
--son. With such stars" as Charley
Hyatt, Les Cohen and‘Paul Zehfuss
gradtiilting, it isnecessary for the

oys «to get. a few weeks of pre-
liminary practice,  ,
From last year’s varsity squad,
there were M. Cohen,‘S. Kowallis,
G. Kowallis, 7T. Lowry, all -taking
their flings at the hoop in order to
cinch the forward positions, Only
three guards from last ‘year’s team
are still available. .They. are Wrob-
leski, Arture and Eddie Baker.
Baker is_not font now due to the

ball practice, but he will -be ready
to go when the season starts. Brown,
who last year subbed at the pivot
position for Les Cohen,_is the only
center from last " year’s" varsity
squad. -  _

. Coming up from the freshman
team, there is Rodgers, Cross, Al-
pert and Cutri, forwards, who were
all instrumental in? carrying the
freshman team through the 1929-
1930- season. Cutri and Alpert
are not out ‘now’ because of spring
football training. V '

Leech, who was dropped from the
Squad. because of studies, is up
again, and he" and Smith are out
for thegcenter position. =:Smith’s
ankle is" sore, butihe was on‘ the
sidelines watching the boys work-
ing out.  M ' . . i
The ‘freshman guards who are out
are the diminutive Herbie Lewis and
Freidler. In addition to these men,
there is Aiello, who‘ played for the
freshman team two years ago « and
who. has returned to school.‘ He
played with the Penn Five from
Sharpsburg, and he ‘reported to
Coach Carlson in tip-top condition.

Attempts to. bring Walter Win-
chell, popular informal newspaper
columnist, to a University . assem-
bly,'as recently announced by James

Lind-say Bus Ad. ’30, chairman of
student council assembly, failed

 

Winchell this week.
In his letter to Lindsay, Winchell
says: “I’m afraid I won’t.be able
to make it. As you say, it would
mean an extra day away from New
York, which would be p-ract’cally im-
possible to arrange, not on y on ac-
count of my work, but I am having
a series of abscesses in the funniest
place and spending a lot of time with
my dentist. Sorry I won't be able
to_meet your gang and thanks a lot

when regrets were received from

It is “ going to -be very hard to’
choosexthey best .possible teamtos
represent Pitt by Friday.‘ Although
the match with Allegheny can 1
hardly be considered more than 9. 
curtain raiser, there is a strong
possibility that sdmebody will be
overlooked. With so much good
material to pickfrom and so short
a time in which to select a, team,
there-« is _a likelihood. that their selec-
tion will be"more‘ or less arbitrary.‘
Those who seem to standfout at?
present are: Morton Baker, whose
vicious forehand. drive has made
many of his opponents gkeatly re-
spect his game; Milton Cohen and
his high-bounding American twist
service; Irvin Goodman’s sound all-
court game, and Ben. Bloom, whose
cannonading forehand has opened:
gaps in the courts of many ofhis
more famous opponents.  '
Contrary, to pre-season predic-
tions, it looks as though Dave;
,O’Laughlin will not be available for’
many matches; His work -in the
Medical school has him tied down.
But if -many more matches. are
scheduled with some good -eastern
teams, you can depend on Dave ;to
help Pitt ‘out. p _ . 2 ,

Diminutive Paul \Zehfuss has cast
his lot with another court team.
Little “Poison” has decided to offer
his services to. Coach McEllroy; and’,
if he uses as much energy on the
tennis court as hedoes onthe bas-
ketball 'ﬂoor, Pitt will have a “pock-
et edition” o” Henri Cochet. ' .

It is too lzad that Charley Hy-E
att is devoting his time to Cap and
Gown, because “Chipper? has po-_..,»
tentialities of developing into —a.
first rate tennis player. ,Pitt ‘could
certainly use at man with such «ath-
letic: ability as Hyatt. -. _ .

“Bill" Tilden seems _to be -going
back on = his word. Lastsummer
at Southampton, “Big Bill” told.
your writer emphatically that he
was through '-representing the -
United. States jnany official play-
ing capacity. However, I noticed in
the papers where Tilden and Jun-
ior Coen had won the Butler Cup
at Monte Carlo‘ for the United
States. Imay bewrong, but we
spent about a.‘ half-hour discussing
that very topic- I told “Bill” that I
there was still too much competi-
tive blood in his veins; but “Bill”.
was stern and .said, “No, Eddie, I
am through playing for the United
States.” Maybe Tilden was kidding
me. '
