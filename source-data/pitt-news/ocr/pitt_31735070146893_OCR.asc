SGB is responsible for allocating the Student
Activities Fund to eligible certiﬁed undergradu-
ate student organizations according to poli-
cies and procedures approved by the Oﬂice of
Student Life. '

Board members and the president also
develop and implement side projects as part
of their duties, though current members and
-President Charlie Shull have emphasized that
the allocations process represents “90 percent
of what SGB does.”

Currently the revised Elections Code — _

which SGB revised in September to allow stu-
dents to vote for up to eight board members

— is in conﬂict with the Board’s constitution,
which ‘dictates that such a change must be ap-
proved by a student vote before it can take
effect. =

The Board addressed the conﬂict at their
meeting Tuesday evening in Nordy’s Place.

“While changes have been made in the
Elections Code,~we ultimately must abide
by the Constitution until it is changed,”. said
Lena Wickenden, Elections Committee chair-
woman. ‘

and President — as well as the different slates

Four Loko pulls caffeine

Four Loko < 1

Steve Garﬁnkel | Staff Photographer

Four Loko will no longer have caffeine, guarana or taurine, according to an announce-

same scrutiny that our products have recently
faced,” the release said.

Anews release from the FDA said thatthe com-
panies have 15 days to remedy the violation of the
Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and prevent
its recurrence. Furtheraction, including seizure of
the cornpany’s product, is possible under federal
law, accordingto the release.

The release did not specify if vendors were
prohibited from selling Four Loko and other caf-
feinated alcoholic beverages. Representatives from
the FDA could not be immediately reached for
comment. A

The FDA’s website stated that its warning ex-
cluded “coﬁ‘ee—based liqueurs,” and focused only
on malt beverages to which caffeine was added.

Some students objectedtothefactthattheban
only extends to malt beverages with caffeine. Pitt
sophomore Max Hatala said that he wasn’t sure
how much of a difference it would make.

“People can just go outandbuyvodkaand an
energy drink, and it’s basicallythe same thing.”
he said.

The controversy has already affected distribu-
tors onand around campus. The 0riginalHotDog

ment its manufacturer released Tuesday.

Shop and Pitt’s Doggin It no longer stock Four
Loko. Mellinger’s Beer Distributor still had about
20 cases of three ﬂavors of Four Loko on display
early yesterday afternoon. '

Employees at all three businesses declined to
comment on the ban.

Justin Whaﬂey, who works at McBroom Beer
DistributorinRegent Square, said thattheynever
carried Four Loko.

“We don’t need a bunch of kids getting sick,”
he said. ‘And We don’t need a bunch of underage
kids tryingto buy it.” ‘

Afterseveral highlypublicized incidents involv-

A ing Four Loko — including an incident in which

nine female students were hospitalized at Cen-
tral Washington University ——  Utah,
Oklahoma, New York and Washington state all
banned the drink before the FDA released its let-
ter yesterday. . '

Homelessness 4 1 -

The results of the survey indicate an increase
of almost 39 percent in the number of homeless
children —— that’s nearly 250 additional children
without homes —— since the 2009 survey, said Bill
Wolfe, executive director of HCEE

In Pittsburgh, 17 homeless shelters are now

‘ able to provide learning centers for the children

to do homework. Services within these centers
include computers, tutors andteachers, whichall
help homeless children continue their education
and, especially, work on literacy.

HCEF contributes to the shelters by providing

the homeless.

“This eventwentwell and most of the members
of our organization showed up,” she said.

In the fixture, HCEF hopes to work with the
Pennsylvaniastatelegislatlireinpassingsenate Bill
1414, which would create a task force to address
childhood homelessness, Lagana said. -

Zachary Wenzel, aPittfreshmen and member
ofPanthers for Homeless Children, said, “During

“Mixing caffeine and alcohol can increase the
risk of alcohol poisoning by making people feel
‘less drunk’ which can lead them to drink more
alcohol for longer periods of time,” she said in an
e—mail. “Moreover, this can make you feel ‘awake
drunk,’ thus, makingyou feel more energetic even
if you are drunk, which can lead to more danger-
ous behaviors such as  drunk, violence or
destructive actions.” A . .

She added thatthe effects on otherparts ofthe
body are harsh as well.

“Alcohol and catfeineareboth diuretics, which
canleadto dehydration (andhangovers). The com-
bination can also make your heart rate and blood
pressure rise quickly and to a dangerous level.
Moreover, adding caffeine (an addictive ingredi-
ent) to alcohol can make drinking alcohol even
more addictive,” she said.

Experienced leader bestto take over Board

ecision time. Today, Pitt

students exercise their

democratic powers once
again —— not to vote for far-away
senators or congressmen as they
did on Nov. 2, but to elect new
members to the University of
Pittsburgh Student Government
Board.

The choices the student body
will make today come at a crucial
moment in the University’s his-
tory, a time of tuition" increases,
permanent overﬂow housing and
a controversial alcohol policy.
The new Board will have a huge-
ly inﬂuential role in addressing
these and future issues, and that’s
why The Pitt News felt it incum-
bent upon us to talk with each
presidential candidate individu-
ally, to deliberate over the past
week and to now make a formal
endorsement. But before we get
to the juicy stuff, let us ﬁrst pres-
ent several valuable ideas offered

by each of the three candidates, »

which we’d like next year’s Board

to consider.

Benjamin Vaccaro, a junior
economics major and member of
the Sigma Chi Fraternity, wants
to improve relations between the
Greek community and campus of-
ﬁcials by scheduling regular meet-
ings between them. We approve of
this proposal —— heightened com-
munication can never hurt. He
also wants to improve SGB’s rep-
resentative quality and transpar-
ency by promoting voter turnout

and by establishing oflice hours in '

Towers lobby. Face time with stu-
dents in Towers is an especially
good idea, as SGB meetings are
notoriously under—attended and
the Board’s day-to-day activities
are less-than-comprehended by
most students.

Matt Weiss, a junior neurosci-
ence and chemistry major and
current SGB Allocations Com-
mittee liaison, has also generated
proposals that should occupy the
time of the future Board. Noting
that Pitt’s Emergency Notiﬁcation

Service has previously not sent out
text alerts when assaults occurred
in Oakland, Weiss demands re-
form of the ENS. Given the stakes
at hand, we believe his concerns
deserve to be addressed. He also
seeks to bring together student
governments across Pennsylvania
for a state-wide college student
coalition, and although imple-
menting such a plan is unlikely
in the short term, Pitt students
certainly could use more clout in
Harrisburg.

Molly Stieber, ‘a junior philoso-

phy and political science major,

and current Board member, also
proposed insightful ideas worthy
of future consideration. With the
federal government’s refusal to
allow tolls on I-80 punching a
$472 million hole in state trans-
portation funding, Stieber wants
to make sure Pitt students are not
adversely affected. Since so many
students rely on public transit to
get to jobs or even to class, seri-
ous advocacy on this issue should

MCT Campus

indeed be a huge imperative for
next year’s SGB. Stieber also
wants to educate more people
about the complex SGB alloca-
tions process by holding an “Al-
locations 101” seminar.As people
have historically found the alloca-
tions process complicated, such
an educational offering could only
help SGB meet students’ needs in
a more streamlined fashion.

With their bright ideas, com-
mitment and indubitable Pitt
pride, all three candidates are
clearly good ones. It’s just that we
believe one rises above the rest.

For that reason, The Pitt News
endorses Molly Stieber for SGB
president.

Although during Wednesday’s
debate she really should have
been able to recite her full list of
responsibilities as business man-
ager of SGB, we believe Stieber
would bring a lotto the Board if
elected. For one, her command-
ing personality clearly meet an
ideal mold of an effective leader.

As well, being the only current
Board member seeking a future
SGB spot other thanjohn Hasley,
Stieber can apply the lessons from
a full year of experience on the
Board to the challenges she faces
next year. In her year of involve-
ment, she has also demonstrated
leadership and drive in pushing
th‘e University Book Center to
ultimately offer more affordable
eBooks on its textbook list, and
she’s hoping to help expand the
eBook options. Perhaps most im-
portantly of all, she has built her
presidential platform on practi-
cality —- with her experience as a
Board member, she knows what’s

accomplishable and she’ll invest ’

herself in getting it done.

The Pitt community is lucky
to have a ballot replete with such
quality candidates, and we believe
it will be even better off if Molly
Stieber leads SGB next year.

If you disagree with us, that’s
OK ~_— neglecting the polls, how-
ever, is not.  ‘

LETI'ER TO THE EDITOR

To the Editor,

I understand that The Pitt
News works very hard at put-
ting together a newspaper for
students to read every day. How-
ever, at my three years thus far
at Pitt, I’ve been very bothered
by the lack of recognition given
to other student organizations
for their hard work. On the front
cover of the Nov. 17 paper was a

great picture of Andrew Jenks.

The caption underneath it says
nothing about the organization
which worked for months pre-
paring to bring him here.
Although the Pitt Program

Council is given credit in the

._ : ‘.“_‘.".'.'.;.T.xl'.i.\T_1;..".“e.T..1;

School of Arts & Sciences 

online article, it is the actual
paper that most students see.
Also, shouldn’t the lecture direc-
tor of the Pitt Program Council
who organized, planned and fa-
cilitated the whole evening get
a shout out?

This lack of recognition has
been an issue in the past and I
hope that The Pitt News is more
careful in the future and gives the
proper credit to organizations
that truly deserve it.

In the words ofjenks, “never
take no for an answer.”

  With finals approaching ,

Start Preparing early

Abdul-Kareem Ahmed
' Columnist

  

« Red and yellow leaves teeter about

as the wind carves away at the trees.
Recurrent rainfall masks the gray of
Pittsburghwithashimmerthat dances
in the ﬂeeting sunlight. Cool fronts
rush through the streets in the early

' evening hour. You know what’s immi-

nent: ﬁnals week, and the tears, brav-
ery and caffeine that come with it.

Yes, thoughwearestillmakingour
way through November and gearing
up for a hopefully relaxing holiday of
turkey, thanks to the unfortunately
early start of Christmas music, we’re
also aware that ﬁnals are fast ap-
proaching.

Finals never made sense to me.
Assessing students’ knowledge of all
the information they learned in every
course theyaretakingwithinthe same

, 120 hours doesn’t seemtoshowmuch

more than how much last-minute-
work students can tolerate. But ﬁnals
aren’t disappearing anytime soon, so
it’s probably best we prepare for the
inevitable rather than question it.
Between now and ﬁnals week,
there are a few things we can do to
maketheﬁnalchapterofthis semester
a smooth one. Now is indeed a good

i ,timetothinkaboutthis—wehave

a few days off soon in case we need
them. ’ s

For one, if you haven’t been or-
ganized with your course materials
during the term, get things together
as soon as you can. Nothing is worse
when preparing for a big exam than
shuffling through papers hypoth-
esizing what you’ll be responsible

for knowing. If this continues to be
a problem this semester, you’ll know

" in the spring to stay organized from

the start.

And for that matter, stay on top of
the past material as much as you can;
ﬁght the urge to fall into an early lull
as vacation time approaches. Finals do
tend to testyou on knowledge attained
throughout the entire semester, but
it’s usually the case that they’ll focus
heavily on the most recent material. Be
diligent so studying later will just be a
review, acustomary routine. ’

A result of staying on top of the
material now is the decreased likeli-
hood of pulling all—nighters later on.
As courageous and cool as pulling an
all-nighter sounds, the science behind
it makes it seem more rash than re-
markable. According to the National
Sleep Foundation, an educational
organization dedicated to increasing
public sleep health, skipping sleep has
a variety of unwanted effects, includ-
ing the inability to concentrate and
solve problems.

You want to avoid it; I once did
two in arow and started falling asleep
with my eyes open, if you can believe
that.

You can also prepare to prepare
for ﬁnals week. That means getting
minor tasks out of the way so you can
dedicate yourself to just your exams
during those‘ crucial hours. These mi-
nor tasks could be last-minute assign-
ments, essays, applications forvarious
activities, ﬁnals meetings for your stu-
dent groups and the like. Maintaining
control of your schedule is an absolute
must. Speaking of which, know your
ﬁnals schedule thoroughly, so you can
prepare accordingly.

Forthe acuial study time, everyone

does it differently. Some people pre-
fer the bustle of Hillman Library and

’ others the comfort of their dorms.

Either way, studying where it is qui-
etest is always a sound choice. What
allows for even more concentration
is studying in some unknown corner
of a building in which there is no cell-

, phone reception, or Wireless PittNet.

It’s just you, the book and the magic
thatwill follow.
How early to prepare is a question

' you can answer; Can you prepare for

anexamforafewweeks, or do youﬁnd
thatadragandthe pressure ofthe two

days beforebetter? Ifyou’re theformer
type of student, then Thanksgiving
break might have added beneﬁts. If
yourﬁnal isanessay ratherthanatra-

ditional exam, it makes even more

sense to start early. Racing the clock

inwritingan essay is aldn to realizing

what you should know for an exam

the day before — it’s not pretty. So

prepare. A

When ﬁnals week is ﬁnally here
and you’ve prepared in advance as
much as you can, then the marathon
won’t seem so bad anymore. None-
theless, youwill get mentally fatigued
as you muscle your way through the
week. Keep yourselffresh after every
exam — you don’t want to stumble
your way through the last couple of
exams in exhaustion. That means leav-
ingthe studyingforanhour and doing
something relaxing. It keeps stress
levels down and keeps you sane.

I’m sure you have your own meth-
ods for dealing with ﬁnals week. But
preparing early will help anyone and
isprobably the most importantthing

~ to consider. I wish you the best.

To the Editor,

Running Wild: My Slate for
SGB -

As I sat listening to each of the
SGB slates for the third time in
the past week, I decided to make
better use of my time and design
my own slate — one that appeals
to all the necessary groups to win
an election and is totally infea-
sible.

~ Slate Appeal #1: The Greeks

-Erect a Tailgating Grove out-
side of Heinz Field, surrounded
by a stone barrier so that only Pitt

{Students could enter — meaning

no Liquor Control Board ruining
everyone’s fun. And while we’re
at it, why don’t we have a real
panther at all of our home games?
If Georgia can have a bulldog, our
endowment should allow us to
afford a panther.

Slate Appeal #2: The Prag-
matists

-Fix the escalators and put

more outlets in Hillman. I have
never witnessed a broken esca-
lator anywhere else on earth, so
why can’t Posvar Hall ﬁgure out
how to stop the escalators from
breaking down every day?

Slate Appeal #3: Allocations
Nerds

-Allocate a signiﬁcant amount

To the Editor,

I am writing this letter in re-
gard to Leah Trimble’s Nov. 15
opinions column, “Do we get
more sexually adventurous as
we age?”

I ﬁnd this article to be a trav-
esty to the spiritual health and
well-being of our school, which
is unfortunately endemic of our
society as a whole. It promotes
sexually degrading and perverse
acts, and their tolerance as “ma-
ture.” Is this what we would like
to see maturity represented by?
Watching and participating in ob-
scene pornographic behaviors
born of nothing more then “plain
ol’ boredom?”

We, as human beings with a
divine soul, have a right to expect
more of ourselves than this. We
are capable of solving poverty,
world hunger and even cancer
and AIDS if we would but put

our boredom and sexual ener-
gies into more productive use.
Napoleon Hill, the author of
“Think and Grow Rich,” talks

_a great deal about the sublima-

tion of sexual energies and how
the redirection of such powerful
forces can accelerate a man, or
woman, tremendously in his or
her chosen ﬁeld!

We live for more then cheap _

thrills in this lifetime, our souls
desire more than these disgust-
ing and disease-causing perver-
sions that pass as entertainment.
Instead of developing “kinks” in
our relationships, would it not be
more beneﬁcial to develop love,
compassion, patience or any oth-
er uplifting virtue? That I would
regard as true maturity.

Thank you,
Michael Israel

‘The beginning of the en

E’ Sara Pecora
Staﬁ" Writer

“Harry Potter and the Deathly Hal-
lows: Part One”

Starring: Daniel Radcliffe,

Rupert Grint, Emma Watson
Directed by: David Yates

Film studio: Warner Bros.

Grade: A

“The beginning of the end” is a ﬁt-
ting tagline for a ﬁlm that signals for
many the penultimate step to closinga

part oftheir childhood. Director David —

Yates, who directed the previous two
Harry Potter ﬁlms, has created a gor-
geous —- albeit bleak —— ﬁlm.

The eponymous Potter (Daniel
Radcliffe) and his friends Ronweasley
(Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger
(Emmawatson) ﬁnd themselves com-
pletely alone for the ﬁrst time. Before
this — even while working on their
own — it always seemed the three
could ﬁnd a bit of a safety net in their
friends, teachers and family. Now,
they have no allies.

The trio spends the ﬁlm working
on trying to track down and destroy
the seven Horcruxes, items that con-
tain the fragments of the wicked wiz-
ard Lord Voldemort’s (Ralph Fiennes)
spirit. Along the way, they must hide
from Death Eaters (Lord Voldemort’s
followers) as well as the Ministry of
Magic itself, whichhasbeen corrupted
throughoutby the Death Eaters. They
must also struggle with innerturmoil
in the group and themselves.

The cinematography and setup in
this ﬁlm is spectacular: One striking
scene is the hauntingly majestic one
in the new Ministry of Magic where
it truly becomes clear that the Min-
istry has become a dystopian “Big
Brother”—type militant monstrosity.
The minute details — including pure-
blood propaganda manuals such as
“When Muggles Attack” —— are par-
ticularly enthralling.

The special—effects team also
upped the ante. In the beginning of the
ﬁlm, the ﬁghts inthe air are beautiful.
The CGI on the house elves Kreacher
and Dobby has vastly improved. There
is even an animated sequence of 3-D

 

animation mixed with silhouette that
was surprising yet very lovely.

Two criticisms of the ﬁlm might
face concern the volume levels and
the abundance of awkward scenes
between the friends.

Certain sounds in the ﬁlm were

unnecessarily loud, the most_ glaring

example being the noises caused by
Lord Voldemort’s beloved pet snake
Nagini. Nagini tends to be used as a
device to make the audience jump,
but every time they have her strike,it
is overly loud. This was one example
of several scenes inwhich noise levels
became distracting.

Tension between Harry, Her-
moine and Ron was ham-handedly
shoved into the script and created
some weird, useless scenes. For ex-
ample, there is a scene where Harry
and Hermione are dancing in a tent
to some music on the radio. It goes
on far too long and lacks purpose in
the flow of the plot. '

These two issues aside, Yates is
debatably the best thing that has
happened to the Harry Potter ﬁlm
series. 3 

MOVIE COLUMN

How No. 7 was almost made

Tybout talks about what two directors would have done with the movie

Andy 'I‘ybout

Assistant A&E Editor‘

If Harry Potter is the boy who lived,
then the “Harry Potter” series is the

franchise that ﬂourished. But what

if bolder directors had handled
Harry’s cinematic debut?

As the adaptations come to a
long—winded ﬁnish, it seems ap-
propriate to pause for reﬂection —
not on what they’ve achieved, but
on what they could have achieved.
Although it’s hard to imagine the
movies as anything other than the
string of glossy installments that
invariably dominated at the box
office, there were several other
avenues the series could have
(taken — several directors more
uncompromising than the ﬁnal
roster. Below, I’ve examined two

accomplished ﬁlmmakers whom
Warner Bros. rejected, and what
their “Harry Potters” might have
entailed.

Terry Gilliam

Who he is: Gilliam, the famed
Monty Python animator, would
likely make ﬁlms antithetical to
the safe, grounded experiences
viewers have come to expect. Af-
ter all, Gilliam is erratic, indulgent,
lewd and, occasionally, brilliant.
His best works —— “Twelve Mon-
keys,” “Brazil” — are triumphant
fusions of intellect and vision -
cerebral thrillers that are simul-

taneously eye-popping. His more.

uneven movies, however, are often
inexplicable and terrifying. Either
way, Gilliam would have been an
economic gamble. _

What happened: Though _].K.
Rowling is a great Gilliam fan —

citing him as her ﬁrst choice for
director — Warner Bros. was un-
derstandably wary about enlisting
the cinematic prankster. Instead,
“The Sorcerer’s Stone” and “The
Chamber of Secrets” fell to Chris
Columbus (“Home Alone,” “Mrs.
Doubtﬁre”), a director who, con-

trary to his namesake, is not an ,

adventurous ﬁlmmaker, and rarely
strays from cinematic convention.
From a studio’s perspective, he was
the perfect ﬁgure to launch the
franchise.

His reaction: Although he ex-
pressed satisfaction with Alfonso
Cuarc')n’s “The Prisoner of Azka—
ban,” Gilliam was predictably dis-
pleased with Columbus’ work, dis-
missing the ﬁrst two ﬁlms as “shite”
and “a factory job.” In a 2009 in-
terview with Total Film magazine,
however, Gilliam was decidedly less

Troy Tipton might use the stage
name Bad Boy Troy, but he’s not
all bad.

Recently, the Pittsburgh—based
guitarist who has opened for

‘bands such as Cheap Trick, has

been using his career as a way to
support charities. He’s begun tak-
ing part in a long-term series of
beneﬁt concerts for the oncology
patients at Children’s Hospital of
Pittsburgh, as well as donating
song revenue to the same cause.

Rockin’ D’s Entertainment -
an agency that arranges concerts
for charities -— had theinitial
idea to promote and coordinate
several performances in Pitts-
burgh. .

But Tipton felt he could go one
step further and raise money for
patients on a regular basis. With
the aid of Rockin’ D’s, he very
recently started his own charity,
Troy’s Angels‘Foundation. He has
also released a song completely
dedicated to charity, his ﬁrst time

doing something like -that.

~ Dorey Duncan, the presi-
dent and promoter of Rockin’
D’s, “wanted me to do a couple
concerts for [the children], and
I said it just isn’t enough,” Tipton
said. “I wanted to do something
else. Overnight, I decided I would
write a song [“You’re An Angel”] .
I donated all the proceeds, which
will benefit Children’s Hospital
and fund things they do there for
the kids.”

Tipton and Duncan aim to
work with the idea for the Foun-
dation, to which Tipton has do-
nated the rights for his song. Each
download requires a-minimum $1
payment, and all proceeds go to
the Foundation.

Work for the nonproﬁt beyond
this, though, is very new. As a
result, no ideas have really been
ﬁnalized for the project '— for

. example, whether the ﬁnancial

support it provides will restrict
itself to only oncology patients
or expand and encompass general
patients, according to Duncan.
The hope, though, is to make per-

formances through the Founda-
tion annual.

‘fTroy [Tipton] will probably
always be involved somewhere,”
Duncan said. “But we hope to get
other artists to join us in these
concerts and grow larger.”

Tipton, who says he “has a big
heart for children,” hopes this
example of giving all revenue

V to a charity rather than into his

pocket will set a trend for other

Tipton began playing drums
after seeing The Beatles’ ﬁrst
performance on “The Ed Sullivan
Show.” He started playing guitar
as a teenager and, by age 17, was
playing in nightclubs. He’s been
in and out of bands ever since,
opening and touring during the
1970s and 1980s with big names
like Cheap Trick and Black Sab-
bath.

“Hopefully, over the years this
will bring them a lot of money,”
he said. “I just wanted to do some-

will see what I’m doing is good
and do the same thing. It could

stopped playing during the ear-

music life with a new album in
1995. He now helps local artists

produces albums. He also still

rent focus on charities.

Duncan says that Tipton’s
sound has continued to evolve
over the decades, from his
’8os sensibility to one “mold-
ed to sound more like 3 Doors
Down.”

Tipton hopes to work on proj-
ects besides performances, such
as producing music videos and
continuing to record.

-“It’s my true talent, perform-
ing for people, writing and re-
cording,” Tipton said. “I try to
help upcoming artists as well. I
just get a joy out of it. Nothing
else makes me feel that same
way.”

The overall focus, though, re-
mains on one group of people.

“This is about the kids,” Tip-
ton said. “This is what we’re do-
ing. Anybody with a heart, I urge
them to come out, because it’s
a beneﬁt for them. All proceeds
go _to the Foundation to help the
children.”

Though Ken Whiteley hasn’t called Pennsylva-

feels an affinity to Pittsburgh and the rest of the
state.

Whiteley feels special p  
connection with the ’Burgh

styles. He will be supported by The Levy Sisters

with an opening performance by Pittsburgh-

’ based soul-folk performerjoy Ike.

After overfortyyears ofperforming, playing
and producing, Wl1iteley’s music crosses genres
with regularity, but ﬁnds its root in music by
people, for people.

“Therewas an oldblues singer named Big Bill '

Broonzy who, when asked what he thought folk
music is, would say ‘Well, I’ve never heard ahorse
sing,”’ Whiteley said. “On one level you can say
it’s folk, blues, gospel, swing  on another level
you could say it’s uplifting music  it’s music that
can touch you in your heart and head.”
Whiteley gained a love of that music during

the folk revival of the 1960s.

“Iwas 14 years old and I went to myﬁrstfolk
festival,” he said. “I saw these great traditional
blues singers: Son House, Mississippijohn Hurt,
the Reverend Gary Davis  and I just thought

‘Man, theseguysareso cool.’ Fromthatyoungage ,

 I thought FI’d love to be an old blues singer?’
Rather than ﬁnding a basis in blues, White-

ley’s opener; Joy Ike, looked towards different.

avenues to forge her own style.

combative, acknowledging that “I
would have gone crazy,” and that
when itcomes to Gilliam ﬂicks,
“I’m like a suicide bomber.” In other
words, Warner Bros. was right to
snub cinema’s mad scientist.

How a Gilliam “Harry Potter”
might turn out: Visuals would be

_ distorted like a funhouse ‘mirror;

Harry and friends would appear
kooky and bizarre — Harry would
likely resemble the protagonist of
“Brazil”: a frail but good-natured
poindexter; the villains and un-
seemly creatures would be gro-
tesque; a "distinct strain of black
would permeate a movie suppos-
edly targeted at young adults.
_ Steven Spielberg

Who he is: Anyone unfamiliar
with Spielberg is either a recluse or
an infant. In either case, they won’t
be reading this column.

What happened: Spielberg was

_doubtlessly a more difﬁcult director

to turn down. After all, Spielberg,
unlike Gilliam, is a master of consis-
tency: a survey of the man’s IMDb
reveals an uncanny track record of

critical and commercial success.
In the end, what probably did ‘

   

' /

the blockbuster auteur in was ambi-
tion: according to the Los Angeles

Times, when Spielberg was offered .

the series he proposed combining a
few of the books into an animated
feature. Because the “Potter” sto-
ries are rife with spectacle, and
because animation in no way pre-

cludes a large proﬁt, this was not

a bad idea. But it was nonetheless
a movetoo bold for ﬁnicky movie

Spielberg:

studios intent on satisfying the
largest possible demographic. In
the end, Spielberg’s vision was too
uncompromising.

His reaction: Spielberg had a
pithy take on his involvement, quip -
ping in 2001, “I purposely didn’t do
the Harry Potter movie because, for
me, that was shooting ducks in a
barrel. It’s just a slam dunk. It’s just

like withdrawing a billion dollars
and putting it into your personal
bank accounts. There’s no chal-
lenge.” Adrnirable, but unbelievable
— especially from the director of
numerous tentpole sequels, includ-
ing “The Lost World,” a “Jurassic
Park” follow-up, and “lndianajones
and the Last Crusade.”

How a Spielberg “Harry Pot-
ter” might tum out: Animated, of

course — a lush, minutely detailed
aesthetic similar to Pixar; charac-
ters would be fully ﬂeshed-out, but
undermined by their cartoonish ap-
pearance; the screenplay would be
ﬁne-tuned to produce impeccable
timing and suspense; the ﬁlms’,

most memorable quality would be
' its awe-inspiring rendering of the

environment and creatures.

Ike connects to audience with

sound that’s ‘soul plus folk’

Whiteley 4 12

“[It’s] pretty much soul plus folk
music,” she said. “Ithas afolk nuance
to it comingfrom  [Pittsburgh non-
commercial radio station] WYEP-type

-stuff. There’s also deﬁnitely a soul as-

pect and it has its easy—listening mo-
ments as we 3’,

Though Whiteley’s focus within
the folk tradition might be different

' lirom Ike’s, they both share a passion

for communicatingthroughtheirlive
performances.

“I love the way music can bring
people together,”Whiteley said. “Ilove
the way it can inspire us and encour-
age us and give us solace and humor
and insight.” ’

“[Performing- live] is about con-
necting with an audience,” Ike said.
“Getting to communicate with peo-
ple.”

In addition to featuring Ike as an
opener, Whiteley will be joined by
The Levy Sisters who add another
layer of vocal music traditionto his
performance. ' a

“They have that magic sister har-

-mony,” Whiteley said. “They have a

background in choirs and so on and
they can just pick out harmonies so

» yr

fast  over the last 15 years we’ve de-
veloped a real musical relationsliip and
they know where I’m gonna go and
they just go there with me which is so
much ﬁm. They.’re great singers.”

Their vocal harmonies will 
be accompanied by another musical
element that Whiteley is passionate
about. '

“I love the stringbass eventhough
that’s not my primary instrument,” he
said. “But ifl hire one other musician,
it’s usually a string bass player.”

Onthis tour, veteran bassist Mark
MurphyissupportingWhiteley’s melo-'
dies on a low-register chordophone.

‘He played ‘with Pete Seeger and
Guy Davis and lots and lots of people ”
Whiteley said. “Mark is my go-to 
when it comes to string bass.”

' Though the string bass might not
be the ins.trument Whiteley’s most
proﬁcient on, his attitude reﬂects his
 to learn.

“It’s a perpetual thing to try and
get better,” he said. “It never stops.
It’s a lifelong pursuit. With all of the
instruments I play, there’s always still
aprocess of discovery and achallenge
intryingto improve.” -

Panthers play tonight i

  

 

john Elsterl Staff Photographer

Pitt’s Dante Taylor scores on a slam dunk against North Florida on Saturday. He will be counted upon to
help the Panthers rebound effectively against Maryland.

Brody Engelhard
S taff Writer

The Pitt men’s basketball team

‘ returns to its home-away-from-

home tonight.

The site is Madison Square
Garden, where Pitt will tip off
against Maryland today at 7 p.m.
as part of the championship
rounds of the 2K Sports Classic
beneﬁting Coaches vs. Cancer.

Madison Square Garden
has been a longtime favorite of
many Pitt fans and players alike.
The Panthers have advanced to
the Big East title game, which is
held there, seven times in the last
10 years and have achieved two
Big East titles. The team has a
24-11 record at the Garden since
the 2000-01 season, winning 12
of their last 17 games, including
an epic victory over Duke.

So far this season, the No. 5
Panthers’ (3-0) biggest strength
has been their veteran backcourt
composed of guards Ashton Gibbs
and Brad Wanamaker. Gibbs, a
junior, came in this_year after en-
joying a breakout season last year
and has continued the success
through three games so far, aver-
aging 19.3 points with 5.3 assists
in 31 minutes per contest. 4

n their second home

His teammate, senior guard
Wanamaker, has been even bet-
ter than expected, averaging 19
points, six assists, two steals and
more than five rebounds while
playing 27 minutes per game.

But for Pitt head coach Ja-
mie Dixon, none of this is a sur-
prise. ’

“They obviously had really
good years last year, both of
them, and they’re better this
year,” he said in the 2K Sports
Classic coaches teleconference.

“I always felt all last year [Wa-
namaker] was overlooked and
underrated. He’s a better player
this year than last year. He does
a lot of things for us.”

Dixon also talked about the
improved play from point guard
Travon Woodall. Woodall has al-
ready made an impact this year as
a key reserve off the bench.

One other player that Pitt fans
are starting to take notice of is
true freshman J .j. Moore. Moore
had his best game as a Panther
last weekend against North
Florida, securing 19 points in 19
minutes off the bench. But Moore
is still a bit of an unproven com-
modity. ,

Panthers drop first game

Torie Wytiaz
Staﬁ” Writer

A new initiative hoping to increase
strength-of-schedule brought the
Panthers and the Golden Gophers

 together for their ﬁrst meeting

Wednesday night.

But it proved to be a disappoint-
ing one for Pitt, which fell 73-63 to
Minnesota.

Although typical early noncon-
ference schedules are often ﬁlled

3' with lopsided matchups against

small conference teams, the Pan-

thers were able to engage in a tough
game against a talented opponent.

The game was part of the inau-
gural “Super Six Series” that seeks
to provide the top national confer-
ences (Big East, ACC, Big Ten, Big12,
PAC-10 and SEC) with high levels of
competition early in the season.

Each participating team will be
guaranteed two games in the series,
one home and one away. The Pan-
thers began playing the role of the
visitor.

Historically, the Panthers have
not fared well against members of
the Big Ten, compiling just a 26—4_5

record before Wednesday’s contest.
After the defeat, the Panthers added
to the loss column on that dismal
statistic.

But for most of the ﬁrst half of
the game, the Panthers managed to
maintain a lead and extend it to six
points before the Golden Gophers
began to mount a comeback, result-
ing in an 11-0 scoring run to end the
half with a 41-34 advantage.

The Gophers’ lead only grew in
the second half of play, culminat-
ing in the ﬁnal 10-point margin of
victory.

The Panthers (1-1) were led

offensively by senior guards Brit— '

taney Thomas and Jania Sims who
contributed 24 and 16 points, re-
spectively. T _

Balanced scoring was vital in
the Panthers’ ﬁrst victory, as four
players earned double—double per-
formances. Some remnants of that
carried over to the efforts against
the Minnesota.

Three Panthers recorded dou-
ble-digit scoring totals in last night’s
contest as Thomas and Sims were
joined by fellow senior guard Ta-
neisha Harris0n’s 12 points.

Still, the offensive effort was not

of season at Minnesota

enough to overcome that of Min-
nesota, who had four players in the
double-digit point range by the con-
clusion of the game.

A reason for the offensive execu-
tion of the Golden Gophers might be
found in the team’s 20 assists, which
showed a tendency to spread the ball
in order to ﬁnd the best shot.

In contrast, the Panthers tallied

just nine assists in the game.

Senior forward Chelsea Cole
led all players with a game high 12
rebounds, giving her double-digit
rebounds in both games of the sea-
son. -

GREGORIAN RANTS .g

Hurdle not the answer toend Pirates string of futility

New manager will try to turn team around, but much like his predecessors, he may find out that is quite a tough task

Greg Trietley
Senior Staﬁ” Writer

 

The Pitt News continues to ex-
’ amine the Pirates’ hiring of new
manager Clint Hurdle.

Clint Hurdle has a champion-
ship in his future.

The Pirates named Hurdle as
their new manager on Monday.

* He’ll try to do what Gene Lamont,

Lloyd McClendon, Pete Macka-
nin, Jim Tracy and John Russell
couldn’t do: guide the Pirates to
a winning record. '

It’s been a long time. If you
measure the losing seasons in
terms of years, we’re entering
year 19. If you measure them by
the number of regime changes,
we’re now six managers removed
from the 1992 Pirates that were
96-66 underjim Leyland.’

But ‘there are other ways to
measure the futility.

After the Pirates’ last winning

season, Leyland managed four’

more middling years in the Steel
City before leaving for the Flor-
ida Marlins. He took his talents
to South Beach and guided the
Marlins to their ﬁrst World Series
championship. He later left the
managing game, only to return
six years later and win another
championship with the Detroit
Tigers in 2006.

The Pirates lost 824 games in
between Leyland’s two titles.

Leyland’s successor, Lamont,

headed the Pirates for four sea—\

sons before the franchise axed
him in 2000. His 1997 record of
79-83 remains the team’s best
since Leyland’s departure. La-
mont works for the Tigers, too,
now, as does McClendon. They
both won the World Series along-
side Leyland in 2006.

If the pattern holds true,
Mackanin, Tracy and Russell will
all have World Series rings before
too long. Tracy won NL Manager
of the Year with the Rockies in
2009.

We can call the last 18 seasons
a rebuilding process, albeit a slow
one. Some franchises just move
faster than others. Take Leyland’s
Marlins: Since Pittsburgh’s last
winning season, theyentered the
league as an expansion franchise,
won, a championship, tore the
team apart, rebuilt, won anoth-

third year of their four-year Super
Bowl losing streak.

» Brett Favre debuted with the
Packers.

i It’s been that long.

For 18 years, the Pirates have
been on the verge of breaking
through. Just two years ago, Jose
Bautista and Freddy Sanchez

There’s a championship in his
future -——-just not with Pittsburgh.

er championship, tore theteam
apart and built a new stadium.
In that time, almost 28 million

' people passed through Three Riv-

ers Stadium and PNC Park turn-
stiles. The average Pittsburgher
went to 11 Pirates games — seven
of them losses.

The last time the Pirates had.a
winning season, “Home Alone 2,”
“Sister Act” and “Aladdin” neared
release on VHS. ‘

The Buffalo Bills were in the

made up half of Pittsburgh’s in-
ﬁeld. After all, Bautista hit 54
homeruns last year. The problem:
He did it for the Blue Jays.

Toronto acquired him two
years ago for a player to be named
later, named later to be catcher
Robinzon Diaz. Diaz played all
of 43 games for Pittsburgh be-
fore the team released him. Not
satisfied with three former Pi-
rates managers, the Tigers signed
him.

Other players that Pittsburgh
let go since 1992? I think it’s best
that I don’t mention them.

At least the Pirates still have
some good players. Soon enough,»
Andrew McCutchen, Pedro Alva-
rez, Neil Walker and Jose Tabata

will become great -- for the Yan-

kees, Red Sox or whoever has a
player to be named later.

A few players from Pittsburgh’s
1992 team are still kicking around
the majors. Tim Wakeﬁeld, who
has never bested the 2.15 ERA
he put up in his rookie season
in 1992, picked up a couple of
World Series championships with
the Red Sox. His former Pirates?
teammate, Miguel Batista, won
one with the Diamondbacks in
2001 before continuing his quest

’ to pitch for every team in the

league (he’s up to 10).

Hurdle is a good manager. He
spurred the Rockies to the World
Series in 2007. Like many Pirates

. players and managers, there’s a

championship in his future -— just
not with Pittsburgh. I

becoming an Oakland Zoo favorite. Fol-
lowed closely by Dante Taylor andthen
Gary McGhee, Zanna is off to a fast start
in replacing junior Nasir Robinson, who
has been out with an injury. As a result,
Robinson might not play in tonight’s game.
McGhee, a senior, leads the Panthers’ big
men on the defensive end, a unit that can
lock opposing offenses down. '

Gary Williams:

that ended 82-79.

Maryland is led by top scorer and
sophomore forward Jordan Williams, who
averages 21 points and 13.7 rebounds per
game.

For Dixon, many of these Maryland
players look familiar: He ran into many
of them on the recruiting trail and knew
then the sort of players they would be-

Pitt is ranked where they p
are for a reason.

“[The Pittsburgh Panthers] are syn-
onymous with good defense, that contin-
ues this year,” Maryland head coach Gary
Williams said. ‘

Where Pitt shows experience, Maryland
(3-0) has some inexperience and is replac-
ing three starters from last year, including
first-round draft pick Greivis Vasquez.
Williams is still working on a rotation that

y will look to include some freshmen.

Earlier this season, Maryland barely

“escaped a tough game against College of

Charleston, taking the lead in the last few
seconds to win 75-74. College of Charleston
upset UNC last year in an overtime game

come. The Panthers should be ready for

' their ﬁrst real test of the young season.

With veteran guards and a great inside-
out game, the Panthers have jelled very
well as a team.

“Pittsburgh is ranked where they are
for a reason,” Williams said. “They have
great guards, you can start right there. In
college basketball, veteran guards make
a difference.”

If the Panthers beat the Terrapins they
will advance to play the winner of the Il-
linois—Te_xas game, scheduled for tomor-
row at 7 p.m. With a loss, they will play
in the consolation game, also tomorrow]
