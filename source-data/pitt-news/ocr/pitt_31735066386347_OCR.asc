After almost four months of
culminating uncertainties sur-
rounding the National
Surgical Adjuvant Breast and
Bowel Project, headquartered
at Pitt, former NSABP Chair
and Principal Investigator Dr.
Bernard Fisher is suing the
university.

Fisher filed a complaint in
the U.S. Federal Court in
Pittsburgh Friday against
Chancellor J. Dennis
O’Connor, Vice Chancellor of
Health Sciences Dr. Thomas
Detre, Director of the
Pittsburgh Cancer Institute Dr.
Ronald Herberman,
Washington, D.C. law firm
Hogan & Hartson and attor-
ney Martin Michaelson.

“It was with extreme reluc-
tance and dismay that I decid-
ed to take the University of
Pittsburgh to court, but I felt
-that there was absolutely no
alternative,” Fisher said at a
press conference downtown
yesterday. “I carmot stand by
and see women continue to be
the victims. I must stand up
on behalf of all research sci-
entists. I cannot stand to see
organizations like the NSABP
disintegrate after what this
group has contributed to

As part of an ongoing budget-cutting process,
the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center
announced June 20 that 73 inpatient’ nursing
positions at Western Psychiatric Institute and
Clinic have been eliminated, while 26 new
part—time inpatient positions have been created.

UPMC President Jeffrey Romoff said the
WPIC layoffs reﬂect a greater trend to reduce

9 America’s health care costs.

Due to a more conservative budget, a greater
demand for outpatient care and declining inpa-
tient needs, WPIC has abandoned its fixed
staffing system andadopted a more ﬂexible
system, UPMC spokesperson Jane Duffield

said.

Currently, UPMC is attempting to cut its bud-
get by 25 or 30 percent over the next three

years, Duffield said.
Romoff said UPMC is a $1.3 billion enter-
. prise, employing a staff of 11,600.

“We have to believe that there is just room, in
such a large institution, to tighten our belts,” he
said.

WPIC’s new ﬂexible staffing system, accord-
ing to Duffield, will more readily accommodate
changes in basic care delivery as well as reduce
costs.

This most recent staff restructuring resulted
from a careful study of WPIC’s unit structure,
Dufﬁeld said.

“We found some of our units were under-
staffed and some overstaffed,” she said.

Duffield said all nurses affected by the
changes have been notified and the layoffs
were conducted on a seniority basis and consis-
tent with the WPIC/Pennsylvania Nurses

Holland
re-elected
president

By Stephen Kozarovich
News Editor

James G. Holland was re-
elected president of the
University Senate for 1994-95
last week. .

Holland, a professor in
Pitt's psychology department.
will be serving as president
for the third year in a row and
said he wants to continue to
try improving life at Pitt.

“It is still my intention to
have [the University Senate
and the administration] all
work together to make the
university a better place,”
Holland said. ‘‘I want to con-
tinue to get the committees of
the senate and university con-
stituencies to work together.”

As president of the

University Senate, Holland-

will be the faculty leader of
the Senate Council and
Faculty ‘Assembly.

Holland said his top priority
this year will be to institute a
budget planning process
which he said has been dis-
cussed but not completely
acted upon.

I “I’m hoping this year we’ll
stop talking and start doing
it,” Holland said. .

Holland said one particular
reason a better budgeting and
planning process needs to be
instituted are the problems
Pitt's dental school has
encountered during a recent
planning and budgeting reor-
ganization. The process was
said to contain “serious
ﬂaws,” according to a Senate
Budget Policies Committee
report.

“The administration is han-
dling it very slowly,” Holland

said. “Frankly, I wish the

administration would get it
together.”

Rose Constantino of the
School of Nursing was re-
elected as vice president and
Thomas Zullo of the School

"of Dental Medicine was elect-

ed secretary, according to the
University Senate office.

Lawsuit

°From page 1
Friday.

“Until such time as University Counsel
has had an opportunity to study the com-
plaint, the university will refrain from
making any comment,” Haley said.

Fisher’s complaint alleges he was
removed as NSABP chair unlawfully by
university officials. The complaint also
states that law firm Hogan & Hartson and
Michaelson, who once represented both
the university and Fisher, now advises an
inquiry at Pitt about Fisher.

Fisher’s removal stemmed from reports
of fraudulent data in the NSABP studies
at Montreal’s St. Luc’s Hospital at the
end of March 1994. Questions were
raised concerning the auditing process of
the NSABP and its administration.

Fisher and university officials testified
before two congressional subcommittee
hearings regarding the federally-funded
NSABP. Throughout the hearings, 11 out
of the nearly 500 research institutions
were found to have auditing discrepan-
cies.

According to the complaint, the
National Cancer Institute ordered Pitt to
remove Fisher as chair and principal
investigator on March 29, 1994. Pitt then
replaced Fisher with Herberman as inter-
im chair.

Fisher’s complaint states the NSABP is
a private organization and adheres to its
bylaws in its constitution dated Nov. 5,
1969. It also said the NSABP bylaws

“provide the mechanism by which that
organization may appoint or remove a
project chairman.”

“The people that have control over
who is chair of the NSABP are the mem-
bers of NSABP and one of our objections
is that the National Cancer Institute and
the University of Pittsburgh came in  to
ask Dr. Fisher for his position when they

Pitt for the past 35 years and earned his
undergraduate and medical degrees from
the university, said coming to the realiza-
tion he had been dismissed as chair was
not an easy matter.

“This illegal action came despite the
fact that my work has produced over the
years many millions of dollars in
research grants and great prestige to the

“I must stand up on behalf of all research scien-

tists. I cannot stand to see organizations like the

NSABP disintegrate after what this group has con-

tributed to breast cancer research.”
— Former NSABP Chair Bernard Fisher

had no right to do so,” said John Bingler
In, one of Fisher’s attorneys. According
to Bingler, at the end of March NSABP
members voted to keep Fisher as chair.

“The Pitt Defendants forced Dr. Fisher
to leave his position with the NSABP to
protect Pitt’s interest in retaining the
NSABP headquarters at Pitt, for its pres-
tige, federal funds and potential future
projects,” the complaint states. “The Pitt
Defendants had no right, justification or
privilege to interfere with the internal
operation of the NSABP, a private orga-
nization.”

Fisher, who has been associated with

university,” Fisher said.

The other part of the complaint con-
centrates on legal counsel used for both
Fisher and the university.

“One of the attorneys which the uni-
versity provided me was acting as my
attorney. Then became the university
attorney in the action which led to this,”
Fisher said.

The complaint states Fisher confided in
Michaelson and the Hogan & Hartson
law firm in conﬁdentiality while prepar-
ing to testify in front of a congressional
subcommittee.

“Dr. Fisher provided Michaelson with

I-

— AFI-JLI-.-SER?/-ICE-S-ALON

his innermost opinions, views and feel-
ings, including his opinions concerning
the NSABP staff, as well as access to his
personal records and files and to all
NSABP records and ﬁles,” the complaint
states.

According to the complaint, Fisher
believes the Pitt defendants improperly
obtained and used conﬁdential informa-
tion from Fisher and the NSABP “for the
purpose of unfairly and unlawfully
enhancing and protecting Pitt’s position."

Fisher is requesting the court declare
Pitt officials, Hogan & Hartson and
Michaelson to be unlawful and in‘ viola-
tion.of his rights and reinstate him as
chair of the NSABP.

He is asking for compensatory dam-
ages for financial loss, humiliation and
inconvenience and for damage to his
health and reputation; punitive damages:
compensation for costs, attorneys’ fees
and other relief deemed just and proper.

“Dr. Fisher has been deprived of his
constitutional right to due process and
has been harmed by incurring legal

expenses, by loss of professional status _

and his life’s work and ongoing projects.
by disruption of his life, ongoing
research, inconvenience, embarrassment
and harm to his health and reputation.”
the complaint states.

According to the complaint, Fisher is
asking that Pitt not use Hogan & Hartson
and Michaelson in any matters involving

professor of astronomy, will
join Schulte-Ladbeck in what
will become the first of two
teams for the mission. The two
professors will study the mas-
sive stellar winds of the Wolf-
Rayet stars.

“The main thing that we
wish to do is study hot stars
that are losing mass,” Hillier
said. “The Wolf—Rayet stars
are massive stars anywhere
from about 10 times the mass
of the sun to 70 times the mass
of the sun.”

The Wolf—Rayet stars are

T beyond Earth’s solar system

and are generally near other
massive stars. Such observa-
tions are sometimes complicat-
ed and several simulations of
the mission will be completed
before the actual mission on
Jan. 12, 1995.

“During the simulations we
will pretend we are flying the
mission and there will be a
team that will simulate all
types of problems to us and all
the things that could go
wrong,” Schulte-Ladbeck said.

‘ “We are basically learning to

respond to potential problems
that could come up.”
Schulte-Ladbeck will have
to deal with “potential prob-
lems” on her other program as
well. She will team up with
Brian Espey, a Pitt research
assistant who also works at
The Johns Hopkins University,
to research symbiotic stars.
The name symbiotic stars
was borrowed from biology,
specifically from symbiosis,
according to Schulte-Ladbeck.

“We will be looking at what
is basically one hot star which
is the white dwarf, and one
large star which we call a red
giant,” Espey said. “These
stars are so close together that
there is a strong inﬂuence of
one star on the other and what
we hope to do is probe some
of the details of what is going
on.”

Although these scientists
will be involved with the
Endeavor mission they will
remain only as observers here
on Earth.

This is not the first time that
Schulte-Ladbeck has been
involved with a NASA project.
She already participated in
Astro-1, the first segment of
the Astro Observatory project.

“In Astro-1 we had basically
the same set of telescopes that
we will have in Astro-2,”
Schulte-Ladbeck said. “The
team I was on was interested
in the polarization introduced
by dust in the interstellar medi-
um.”

Working in part with
Schulte-Ladbeck will be grad-
uate student James Herald and
with Espey, graduate student
Jennifer Birriel. Schulte-
Ladbeck said she hopes the
results from her work will lead
to scientific publication as well
as a new experience.

“I was very excited about
[being chosen],” Schulte-
Ladbeck said.

“I think it is fantastic if you

can get observations that are

being done from the space
shuttle, it is unique.”

by information disclosed in vio-
lation of the attorney-client
privilege,” independent counsel

and experts have been appoint-
ed to the panel, adequate notice
of specific charges have been
given to Fisher and adequate
response time is given to Fisher.

“Our hope is that they will see
the error of their ways and rem-
edy them by reinstating Dr.
Fisher and allowing scientific
research to go forward,” Bingler
said.

Layoffs

°From page 1
Association collective bar-
gaining agreement.

Regarding the 26 new part-
time positions, Duffield said
all nurses were hired intemal-
ly and all 73 nurses who lost
their job had an opportunity to
apply for these new positions.

These changes follow two
other UPMC announcements
of staff reductions this sum-
mer.

In May, UPMC announced
185 nurses will lose their cur-
rent positions by December
because of restructuring in
medical—surgical units. At the
-same time, UPMC announced
that 100 new positions will be
created for which all 185 nurs-
es will have the opportunity to
apply.

June 2, UPMC announced
the elimination of 35 staff
positions at WPIC in order to
reduce budget expenditures.

“When anybody loses a job

it is a tragic situation,”
Romoff said.

Although other health care
companies may hire the laid-
off nurses for non-hospital
workor home care, the nurs-
ing job market is getting much
tighter, according to Romoff.

Instead of paying nursing
school graduates $40,000 in
their first year out of school,
hospitals are now hiring and
training graduates with bache-
lor’s degrees in social work
and psychology for signifi-
cantly lower salaries, Romoff
said.

“Nurses have perennially
been inshort supply, [but]
now almost every institution
in Pittsburgh is laying off
nurses,” he said.

UPMC’s staff-restructuring
process will continue, accord-
ing to Romoff.

“I would hope we are mid-
way though  but I don’t see
the end,” Romoff said.

Look around.

Stand in front of the William Pitt Union on the Fifth Avenue
side, look directly across the street and you will notice two can-
nons aimed at you, with plenty of ammunition stacked right
beside them. ,

Look around. .

At Pitt, you are always under the gun, and the administration is
always ready to exchange a few rounds of bureaucratic cannon-
balls with you, no matter who you are.

Look around.

Busloads of people have been touring Pitt, following universi-
ty representatives around and listening and looking at the univer-
sity that has been carefully edited for public viewing.

Look around. .

While some may be impressed by the history and tradition of
the William Pitt Union, they should also be wary that their backs
are turned to the big black carmons that loom just yards away.

Look around.

Students are coming to Pitt in search of an education, for a
taste of the real world, something you don’t get when it is spoon-
fed to you. The real education comes when you are able to be
your own tour guide, and watch the uncut, unedited version.

Look around.

Thousands of people get caught in the cross ﬁre of bureaucrat-
ic bombardment, from bureaucrats who have been marming their
cannons long before a group of students comes in, and will be
manning their cannons long after that group of students leaves.

Look around. ~ .

What do you see?

Integrity comes first

Sixteen years ago, a prohibitive list of corporations who had
business ties with South Africa’s pro-apartheid government was
drawn up.

In response to the apartheid movement in South Africa, Pitt
froze all investments with the list of corporations who continued
to do business with the country. 7

Two weeks ago Pitt’s board of trustees passed a Senate
Council resolution which permits the University of Pittsburgh to
reinvest in corporations conducting business in that country.

Sadly, the world is often a place where money, power and
inﬂuence dominate; overshadowing ethics and integrity at times.

It is comforting to know that Pitt had enough integrity to rule
out any involvement with South Africa during the time of
apartheid. .

Moving on to a new era where apartheid lies dormant at th
feet of equal rights, and involvement with South African busi-
ness is in the picture again, Pitt should exercise as much integri-
ty if not more to monitor the situation in South Africa, making
sure apartheid is never awakened.

Investing in South Africa is beneﬁcial for the country, and will

make the move toward total freedom, and economic stability A

easier for the new government under Nelson Mandela.
The university should be commended for its decision.

Permanence of racism orouncl us

A friend sent me a clipping
of a Pitt News article: “Do
Blacks Want to End Racism?”
by columnist Rick Nowlin. I
was surprised by Mr. Nowlin’s
comments on race in general,
and saddened by his misinter-
pretation of the message in my
book, Faces at the Bottom at
the Well: The Permanence of
Racism.

I was surprised because the
evidences of racism’s perva-
siveness — and likely perma-
nence — are all around us. Mr.
Nowlinisuggests that blacks
like myself somehow wish to

F . perpetuate racism. This conclu-

sion, offered without any evi-
dence beyond conjecture, is
both wrong and insulting. He
might read Professor Andrew
Hackers’ book, Two Nations:
Black and White, Separate,
Hostile, Unequal. There are lit-
erally dozens of other books,
most of them by white authors,
that conﬁrm the continuing vir-
ulenceof racism in our society.
Mr. Nowlin defines racism
“as relating to others based pri-
marily on their race, color, or
ethnic origin.” The defect in
his definition is in the inade-
quacy of the verb “relating.”
Racism refers to the exercise of
societal power by members of
a dominant group over a
minority based on race for the
purpose of subordinating that
group. Slavery and officially
sanctioned racial segregation
were racist policies. Through
the efforts of many, black and
white, those policies were
mostly abandoned. But the
essence of those policies, to
provide priority to whites for
all resources of value and
maintain blacks in a subordi-
nate position, now manifest
themselves in “racially neutral”
forms that are no less exclu-
sionary and discriminatory.
Does Mr. Nowlin really believe
the tremendous gaps in black
and" white, income, unemploy-
poverty and life
expectancies, are simply fortu-
itous? Can he really believe
that blacks prefer to live in the
squalid conditions that many
are forced to in Pittsburgh as
well as urban and rural areas

across this country?

I am saddened by Mr.
Nowlin’s column because his
father, Alphonso “Sonny”
Nowlin, was a childhood
friend. Neither Sonny nor 1
were able to prepare our chil-
dren for the forms of discrimi-
nation they would encounter in
the post-Brown era. They have
had to face thinly-veiled hostil-
ity and rejection without the
defensive tools forged by our

 

parents when racial bigotry
was open and blatant. It
appears that Mr. Nowlin’s most
memorable discriminatory
experience was being called
“nigger” every day during his
attendance at the Central
Catholic High School. He
reports that by ignoring this
bias, he ﬁnally was able to gain
acceptance. Does he share this
story as an example of what all
blacks should do? Accept
being called and treated in a
derogatory manner in order
that some day we may gain
acceptance based on voluntary
submission to such treatment?
Surely, this is not the “bridge-
building” he espouses as
opposed to the militant seeking
of “rights.” V

For most of us, ethnic slurs
are the least of the barriers we
face in this society.
Employment discrimination,
which Mr. Nowlin tends to dis-
miss, is our major problem,
one that continues to grow
worse as jobs in our economy
are lost to automation, the
movement “off-shore” of much
of our manufacturing potential,
and the importing of foreigners
willing to work for wages far
below the minimums set by
law. Power to defend against
the discrimination that perme-
ates the employment patterns is
the essential prerequisite of the
justice Mr. Nowlin prefers.

Dr. King wished to bring

people together, but he recog-
nized the economic barriers to
such togetherness. He died. as
Mr. Nowlin should surely
know, encouraging the organiz-
ing of sanitation workers. King
recognized that without organi-

zational power, there can be no '

justice. It is ironic that during
his lifetime, and particularly
after his criticism of poverty at
home and the Vietnam War
abroad, that Dr. King was spo-

ken of in the same disparaging»-

terms Mr. Nowlin aims at Al
Sharpton and Louis Farrakhan.
Despite my views on racism,
I would wish for Mr. Nowlin
that he experiences no greater
discrimination than he reports.
I fear though that he will both
face discrimination and be far

"less ready to cope with it than

the occasions will require. If he
has, in fact, read my book, I
hope he will read it again. He
will ﬁnd that I quote the New
Testament at several points
and, as he does, urge the break-
ing down of barriers and the
building of relationships.
Nothing in my book argues
against good relationships witl:
whites. Both in my career and
in my life generally, I have

benefitted from strong and sup- *

portive relationships with
white people. The alleviation
of racist policies, though, will
require more than positive.

interracial friends and associ-

ates. To bring about the racial
reforms some of us want
requires a much clearer under-
standing of racism’s history
and its contemporary manifes-
tations than Mr. Nowlin
exhibits in his article.

Finally, you described Mr.
Nowlin with seeming pride as
“an independently-minded
columnist,” a characterization
all too many whites tend ‘to
reserve for those blacks whose
positions on race are not threat-
ening to whites, and thus wel-
comed even though they are
substantially at variance with
those of the great majority of
blacks. Independence of mind
of that character may be a com-
fort to you, but it is a disservice
to your readers.

John McGahern: the Collected
Stories

by John McGahern

Vintage International, $12

Too bad for McGahern that
the boys at Vintage felt the
need to slap a quote from USA
Today on this edition’s front
cover, proclaiming our hero
“the best Irish short—story
writer since James Joyce.” Of
course those literary giants
over at McPaper have skipped
the likes of O’Faolain’s,
O¥’Flaherty’s, O’Kelly’s and
the odd assortment of names
not beginning with “O,” in
their quest to knight Mr.
McGahern into the canon.

Regardless of this silly busi-
ness McGahern is onto some-
thing and apparent from these
stories has been for years with-
out much publicity over here.
Steeped in a style of dark,

 as 

immediate prose this collec-
tion winds through the heart of
Ireland and to places beyond,
filled with people whose
inability to see and feel each
other with any kind of under-
standing becomes mired in the
murk and darkness of the self.

These fine moments reap-
pear in a story like “Wheels”
when a workman cusses pro-
fusely in a train compartment
about the plight of the laboring
man and admits his current
task of burying his “good-for-
nothing” brother, not seeing
that one of the occupant’s
jackets hides a priest’s collar,
and upon catching sight of the
collar as the priest gets up to
leave the man is compelled to
chase him down and apolo-
gize. These are places, times
when through all the hours of
circular conversation, laughter
and exchange that some spo-
ken truth occurs, out loud and
immediately the weight of for-
bidden honesty crushes the
desperates who utter its
sounds.

There is a tragic movement
among men and women in sto-
ries “My Love, My Umbrella”
and “A Ballad” where they
come together for a brief time
and are turned away from one
another by their inability to
understand the other. In “My
Love, My Umbrella” intimacy

revolves around a habitual sex
act performed standing up in
the rain, under an umbrella,
behind a church and “out of
the street light.” Forced to
meet and love in the cold and
rain because his going up to
her room “would cause trou-
ble,” the pair in this story
never understand what goes on
in the other’s mind and this
lack leads to their demise and
the end of hope.

Something like this hetero-
pessimism continues among
the frustrated couple in
“Peaches.” McGahern pulls
this husband-wife right out of
Hemingway. This writer and
his spouse bicker endlessly
while he drinks instead of
writes until they are forced to
abandon the Spanish coast
when a dangerous, corrupt
local official takes a shine to
the wife shoving ripe peaches
down the breast pockets of her
dress in one of the most sexu-
ally—charged scenes in the
book. Again, this is past pain
she bears from her father’s
death. A pain she always
comes back to at the height of
their unhappiness and refuses
to let go of even when the sex-
ual threat of the magistrate
forces a momentary, if only
practical, union as the two
decide to leave for London.

“Korea” takes us to a son’s

The Pitt News

Wednesday, July 13, 1994

inquiry of his father’s past wit-
nessing of an execution as a
prisoner of war. This moody
piece moves out from the
question of a son on a fishing
boat with his father and out
into exposing the story’s cur-
rent dilemma of the son possi-
bly leaving for America and
“opportunity” or whether to
become a soldier like his
father. When the son rejects
the notion of emigrating, the
father laments his son’s lost
chance at escape and notes that
if he’d “conducted his own
wars, and let the fool of a
country fend for itself, I’d be
much better off today.” Finally
the son realizes the signifi-
cance of this passing of tradi-
tion from father to son as he
tells us, “each move he made I
watched as closely as if I too
had to prepare myself to mur-
der.”

Like most Irish short stories
we get to see just how the Irish
use English, a language which
is not really theirs, never
names them accurately and
when it comes close, does so
uncomfortably. McGahern is
much like the headmaster in
“High Ground,” always going
“down the road” but never
naming the pub or even telling
us of the act of drinking, only
pointing to a place altogether
beautiful and mean with plain-

 

ness of action and the irony of
words.

James Joyce’s Dubliners

An Illustrated Edition

with annotations by John Wyse
Jackson &

Bernard McGinley

St. Martin’s Press, $35

Dubliners is the perennial
Irish classic of short—story
writing. It contains, almost
unarguably, some of the finest
writing in the vast fields of
peat and shit which we call
English literature. Wading
through its 15 stories is not
unlike moving through the life
cycle which it represents:
some wish only to see the sur-
face and the brilliance it holds,
but others would like to know
every tiny detail which has
been hand painted onto each
scene. For the followers of the
second philosophy and the
legion Joycean fans and schol-
ars who have been waiting
years for this, we have Jackson
and McGinley’s annotated
Dubliners.

Dubliners, as a book, needs
no introduction. It is Joyce’s
celebration and damnation of
his hometown and a feast in
honor of the inactivity and
wondrous banality of Irish city
life. It is the epitome of the

°From page 6
Irish literary love/hate strug-
gle; as J.P. Dunleavy would
say, a portrait of Ireland “in all
her sins and some of her
graces.” The book is the first
complete published work by,
undisputably, the most impor-
tant writer of the 20th century,
and now it has been excavated
fully, giving a refreshing new
look to Dubliners for those of
us who cannot spend our lives
researching.

And now I am doing what I
said need not be done: intro-
ducing. It is more important to
introduce this new edition,
with its Joycean, stark, still
photo cover of O’Connell
Street North from 1902. The
jacket of the book is what first
grabs the Joyce fan’s attention.
The photo shows waxeni faces
carved of turf and stone, the
Phoenix Park trolley forever
enshrined in a moment of
unmovement and the rows of
street lamps, permanently
awaiting their evening light. It
is as Joyce must have remem-
bered Dublin, in Switzerland
and in France, as he sat typing
his hateful and dangerous
books. This is the greatest vic-
tory of this annotated edition:
it manages to stay true to
Joyce, from cover to cover.

Although the idea probably
has him rolling in his moist
grave, of all the possibilities of
new Dubliners editions, this
would likely be his least-hated.

To open the book is to give
oneself over to a sort of
despair; is it too much to han-
dle? Of course it is. To read
the book, it is necessary to
ignore much of the myriad of
annotations which fill more
than a page for every one of
prose. Jackson and McGinley
have found photos, illustra-
tions, advertisements and allu-
sions for most every aspect of
the stories, be it a tum-of-the-
century photo of the Liffey
ferry or an advertisement por-
traying the competition
between Irish and Scotch
whiskeys. This edition ﬂoods
the reader with information
pertinent to the stories and
asides which lend to the true
flavor of Joyce’s Dublin.
Perhaps the drawback in the
new edition is the overload of
information: Dubliners

becomes difficult to read at_

least. At most, the stories
become transformed into
another Ulysses, a work of
such biblical proportion that
one could easily spend the
entire Pittsburgh summer
enveloped in the waters of the

river Liffey, without ever leav-
ing Bloomfield.

However, it is possible to
simply read the stories, glance
at a few illustrations and read
the occasional note when one’s
interest is truly caressed, and

this is why this new edition is 1

so marvelous. It will always be

’ there for you, through the days

and years of Joycean reading
we all must survive, whenever
you need to know one more
thing about Ibsen’s inﬂuence
on “The Dead.”

The Commitments, The
Snapper, The Van

One of the difficult tasks of
an Irish writer is to attempt to
capture on lifeless pages in
black ink the mannerisms. the
subtle ferociousness and the
complete indirectness of pur-
pose which characterizes the
beautiful and lyric manner in
which Irishmen speak. Irish
use of the English language is
so secretly corrupt, so rebel-
lious, that it often defies the
possibility of true prosaic rep-
resentation. James Joyce could

do it, John McGahern can do

affinity for smooth whiskey. It is this front, this’

deception, which Doyle brings to the literary stage of
Ireland. His novels appear to be stories, well-plotted,
humorous and perfectly executed tales of working-
class Dublin life. This is true, that’s what his
Barrytown trilogy is, but it is also some of the finest
fictional Irish dialogue on paper. Doyle understands
the language of the Irish, and more specifically the
North Dubliners, as well as any alive. He also under-
stands the lives of. Dublin children and teens, as the
success of his Booker Prize-winning novel Paddy
Clarke Ha Ha Ha proves. More important than his
understanding is his manner of illustration. Doyle can
write fascinating, serious, funny and timely pieces
about life in Dublin which simultaneously portray the
Dublin character in impeccable fashion.

The first of his books, The Commitments, is easily
the best known. Made into a major and successful
motion picture, it is the story of Irish Soul, the reve-
latory, momentary release from the burden of Irish
culture through black’ American music, and the falsi-
ties and difficulties which bring the failure of that
release.

The Snapper, also made into a movie, portrays the
problems and solutions of Catholic Ireland at its
finest. The hellfire which erupts from a daughter’s
unwedded pregnancy provides canvas for Doyle’s
Dublin portraits. Finally, in The Van, a father’s unem-
ployed boredom and despair leads to the establish-
ment of a Fish & Chips van run by his friends and
family. Much like The Commitments, Doyle shows
how the Irish difficulty with communication destroys
movements, leaving Joycean inactivity.

Any of these stories, on their basic level, could

have slipped into cliched ‘.‘_une_m_pl0yed.father strug-
""‘

L

labels to satisfy old Bostonites in their never-ending
search for Hibemo-struggle lit. The Snapper could be

retold, by a drunken lot of sadistic screenwriters, as a
CBS After School Special, and the Commitments
could have ended up in the young adults section at
the Carnegie. However, Doyle’s prose is channeled
directly from muse to paper. His verbal paintings
swirl in Van Gogh cloud formations of cuss words
and slang, leaving American heads swimming in
Grafton Street cat calls and ﬂipping to the back,
looking for the glossary. Doyle’s books, especially
The Commitments, make little sense read; even on the
bus readers will ﬁnd their lips ﬂapping up and down,
and their tongues trying to mimic Gabriel Byme’s
speech.

Try it like this. Turn the corners of your mouth
down, subtly, and pull your left cheek in slightly, not
noticeably, just enough that the air moves across your
inner cheek as you speak. Now, think about Bono in
any interview you’ve heard him speak, and remem-
ber the way your grandfather used to sing “Danny
Boy” when you were 3. Don’t be afraid to ham it up,
the Irish sure would. Now read any Roddy Doyle
book. Out loud.

that your beloved The Pitt News Showcase staff

Neil Jordan is most famous in England and
America for showing a woman drop her robe and her
penis, in front of Stephen Rea in The Crying Game.
However, in Ireland he’s been highly recommended
since his 1976 masterpiece Night In Tunisia. This
collection of short stories shows a master of the
melancholy sexual difficulties which Irish literature
has made its meal ticket. In the title story a boy
raised on the East Coast show band circuit, from

. which Irish pop music was born, discovers his awak-

ening sexuality through the arrival into his diet of
Charlie Parker and American jazz music. The story
beautifully shows the importance of American cul-
ture in Irish life and tells a tale similar to that of The

~ Commitments, in the way music is used as a release,

an escape from the repression of sex and communica-
tion which Irish writing attempts to describe to the
world. Night in Tunisia isn’t the happiest of collec-

The Pitt News, Wednesday, July 13, 1994

tions to read; longing, suicide and demise pervade
Jordan’s writing. But if you want happy, skip Dublin
and go to Seattle.

John Banville is the literature editor of the Irish
Times, and the author of nearly 10 novels over 15 odd
years. His writing is lyrical, poetic prose which twists
and turns like a reel, embracing both reader and char-
acters as one, as inseparably unreal. In The Book of
Evidence, Banville sketches a portrait of an educated
killer, a suave and handsome super-literate murderer.
In doing so, Banville discusses the true nature of evil,
his favorite subject. Evil, to Banville, is a separate
and powerful entity, an almost deiﬁc existence sepa-
rate from good and from judgement itself. The Book
of Evidence is the tale of a man who killed simply
“because he could,” and shows why this exists in all
people: the lure of the epiphanic moment of pure,
reasonless evil which murder, especially motiveless
murder, encompasses. Banville’s books are
metaphors, in themselves, for Ireland. “A Terrible
Beauty.” His writing is bleak, and almost terrifying at
times, yet so pure and shockingly beautiful as to
require repeated readings.

-- (jh)

Very often things Irish involve a bit of something
that only comes to life when “put on.” Maybe that’s
why the place comes up with likes of Yeats, O’Casey
and Beehan. A more recent dramatic genius would be
that of Brian Friel whose Dancing at Laughnasa was
a huge Broadway success and had a local run here
recently.“A relative secret around these parts would
be his earlier works which are full of a kind of dark
energy much like John McGahern’s. Despite the
assumption that you’re missing something by reading
a play, Friel’s stuff, found in a collection like The
Selected Plays of Brian Friel ( Faber and Faber,
1984), can be had in paperback and have a minimal-
ism that translates to a good solo reading. You can
opt for a signature piece like Philadelphia, Here I
Come or move into the eerie, fascinating mono-
logues of The Faith Healer. Any of his plays come
off with a great deal of power and could turn out to
be a much-needed alternative read.

This is baloney! I can’t

say something so outrageous.

Well, then again, I guess it is
not his fault. He is just one of
millions of people in America
who share this same view due
to being unaware of the prob-

What he fails to realize is
that standardized admissions
tests for our universities are
culturally biased, and that

‘Prop. 48 and similar rules rely

too much on these tests.

from intercollegiate athletics
by the NCAA standards,
known as Prop. 48. Of those

ground can be determined,
86.8 percent were black.

That’s why the NCAA presi-
dents’ panel should pass the
recommended Prop. 174,
which makes admission less.
dependent upon the standard-
ized tests.

Under Prop. 174, the higher
one’s GPA, the lower one can
score on his or her standard-
ized tests and vice versa.

For instance, one can get as
low as a 410 on his or her
SATs and still be eligible to
play his or her freshman year
as long as he or she maintains
a 3.0 grade point average in
high school.

Sadly, it looks as if this will
only remain a dream. As of
August 1995, the NCAA will
use Prop. 16, which in effect
depends even more on the
standardized tests.

Under this guideline, a stu-
dent who possesses a 2.0 core
GPA must score a 900 on his
SATs. If a student should only
score 700, then he or she must
have a GPA of 2.5 or better.

This will deprive underprivi-
leged kids of obtaining their
dreams of getting a college
education. It is a proven fact
that standardized grades mea-
sure not ability but socioeco-
nomic status.

Notre Dameioins Big East

Fighting Irish becomes 73th nlember

By Jack Becker
Sports Editor

Four months after the Big
East admitted West Virginia
and Rutgers as full members,
the conference has expanded
again adding Notre Dame as
the 13th Big East school.

Notre Dame announced
Monday it will join the Big
East in all sports except foot-
ball beginning in 1995.

“We’re excited. Notre Dame
is a prestigious institution,”
Big East Commissioner Mike
Tranghese said. “We think it’s
a good marriage.”

Notre Dame was‘in dire need
of a big market conference,
particularly for its men’s bas-
ketball program, and the Big
East made an exception after
recently solidifying its future
as a conference with the addi-
tions of West Virginia and
Rutgers.

At the same time those two
former football-only schools
were invited to join the confer-
ence, Temple and Virginia
Tech were rejected admission.
This apparently ended Notre
Dame’s bid to join an all-
sports conference with the Big
East’s non-football schools.

Big East presidents had said
in March that any further
expansion before the year 2000
was unlikely unless “a unique
exception” surfaced. The
Fighting Irish proved to be just
that.

“They’re the only institution
that could have brought us
back to the table,” Tranghese
said. “Everyone has an opinion
on Notre Dame. People either
love them or hate them. They
are a very powerful factor.”

The addition of Notre Dame

to Pitt athletes in years to come. .

brings a number of positive

aspects to the Big East.
“They are a national type
school,” Tranghese said.

“They’re respected academi-
cally, they have a tremendous
upside in basketball, exposure
in the Chicago market and
most importantly our presi-
dents were very comfortable
with being associated with
Notre Dame.”

The Big East now spreads its
influence into the Midwest.
Notre Dame is 90 miles from
Chicago, the second largest

television market, where the
Fighting Irish have a vast fol-
lowing.

Also, Notre Dame is a
national power in some of the
non-revenue sports such as
baseball, lacrosse, soccer,
men’s and women’s tennis and
volleyball.

“I think it’s really gonna help
[Notre Dame’s] programs,”
Pitt Associate Athletic
Director Carol Sprague said.
“They’ve got wonderful facili-
ties, a very good women’s vol-

National

wins In
extra

innings

They finally did it. In the
bottom of the 10th inning
Moises Alou hit payday and
helped send the National
League rocketing into their
first All-Star win in six years.

With Tony Gwynn on first
base, Alou sent a Jason Bere
pitch to deep left-center.
Rounding second on his way
to third Gwynn was waved
home by third base coach
(Pirates’ skipper) Jim
Leyland.

The play turned out to be a
close one at home plate, but
Gwynn’s slide barely got
under the tag of catcher Ivan
Rodriguez.’

The excitement of the last
inning was one of only a few.
Fred McGriff of the Atlanta
Braves blasted a two-run
homer that tied the game at

. seven in the bottom of the

ninth sending the game into
extra innings. For McGriff the
dramatic home run sealed his
fate on becoming the All-Star
Most Valuable Player.

“At first I was just hoping to
get an atbat, it was getting
late,” McGriff said. “When I
finally get to bat and I’m
telling myself be aggressive
and Lee (Smith) gave me a
fastball down and away and I
hit it out.”

Women's basketball signs Player of the Year

By David Saliba
Staff Writer

Kirk Bruce, Pitt’s women’s
basketball coach, has found a
needle in a haystack.

The surprising acquisition
turned out to be Jaime Warren
who hails from Tucson, Ariz.

According to Bruce, Warren,
the 5-foot-3-inch point guard,
was lucky to find this late in
the year.

“We didn’t think she’d be
available, but she was, and we
were actually shocked,” Bruce
said. “We are very excited to
have her and it seems that
things tend to work out for a
reason.”

“Jaime  is an additional
player to play point guard with
a lot of quickness and fast-
breaking ability which is
something that we need to go
along with someone like Carol
Morton.”

Bruce continued, “We will

have the luxury of putting
three different players at the
point guard spot. “Now with
Jaime we probably have the
three best point guards on one

Tuscon All-City/Player of the
Year. “I’ve always wanted to
play basketball at the colle-
giate level. At Pitt, I just want
to help the team out anyway I

team in the whole league.”

As Bruce looks to Morton
for leadership next year, he
will turn to Warren to back up
Jo Jo Guzman, who played in
only four games last year due
to an injured knee.

“I have to gain some confi-
dence first, then I think I’ll do
really well,” said the 1994

can.”

According to the Pitt coach-
ing staff, Warren will make an
immediate contribution to the
team.

“I see her coming off the
bench and to be also used with
Carol Morton because of her
speed,” Bruce said. “She’ll
definitely make an impact.”

Last year, as team captain of
Tuscon High, Warren collected
some impressive statistics. The
team MVP averaged 13.8
points, 2.9 rebounds, 2.3 steals
and 2.1 assists per game, earn-
ing first team All-State and
All-Metro selections.

According to Bruce, the
point guard was initially inter-
ested in playing at the
University of Arizona or
Arizona State but they didn’t
show much interest in her.

“For some reason they didn’t
recruit her heavily maybe
because of her size,” Bruce
said. “The other schools may
have been wary about her size,
but in our league I think quick-
ness is very important.”

Bruce is quick to point out
that basketball isn't her only
talent.

“She’s a great student who is
concerned about academics as
well as being a very nice per-
son,” Bruce said.

leyball program. All and all it
happens to be a good deal for
all parties.”

Notre Dame is currently a
member of the Midwestern
Collegiate Conference, a non-
football conference, in every’
sport but basketball, where it
is an independent.

The biggest advantage for
Notre Dame is the potential
for its basketball program to
become top-20 caliber, as
it was in the 1970s and ‘80s.
The Fighting Irish basketball
program has fallen in recent
years due to its absence from a
conference in an era when big-
time independents like Miami,
Florida St. and Penn St. have
migrated toward a league for-
mat.

Tranghese said Notre Dame
was interested in the Big East
over other conferences like the
Atlantic Coast Conference
because the Fighting Irish
have a long history with
Big East schools. There are
attractive markets — particu-
larly New York City -—;in
the Big East, but the confer-
ence expressed no interest in

playing football with Notre
Dame.

“I think if we would have
mentioned football it would
have ended the discussions,”
Tranghese said.

Notre Dame is intent on
remaining an independent in
football where the school has
a special television deal with
NBC that runs through 2001.
No plans for Notre Dame to
join Big East football were
discussed.

“It was a chance for us
to deal with Notre Dam_e
once and for all,” Tranghese
said. “We knew we would
have to compete against
them anyway. We decided we
would rather be partners with
them.”

“[The Big East] is looked at
as one of the better confer-
ences in the country and hav-
ing Notre Dame can only
enhance that.”

West Virginia, Rutgers and
now Notre Dame will begin
competing in the 1995-96 sea-
son.

No format has been released
yet but it is possible the con-
ference could split into two
divisions with 13 teams, simi-
lar to the Southeastern
Conference.

“Geography-wise,” Sprague
said, “it makes [Notre Dame]
the most westerly school.
Previously, Pitt was and we
took a lot of good-natured rib-

’bing about it. Now Notre
'Dame is the west=ern-most -

school in the Big East confer-
ence.”

against minorities. Such tests
measure not basic abilities but
rather middle-class standards
and ways of thinking. That is
why I strongly recommend
that the NCAA forget about
Prop. 16 and choose Prop.l74.

Prop. 174 will enable hard-
working students to enter col-
lege without having the pres-
sures of taking a biased test.

“I had it made in high
school,” recent Pitt grad
Christopher.Martin said. “I
was the class president, cap-
tain of the football and track
teams. My [GPA] was a 3.2
but I got a 690 on my SATs.
Because of this I lost my track
scholarship to Temple. They
told me they couldn’t afford
another [Prop. 48 student.]”

“That’s one moment in my
life I will never forget. In their
eyes, I went from class presi-
dent to just another dumb
jock. Everywhere I went it
seemed as if I was labelled
Prop. 48  Prop. 48  Prop.
48.”

Martin is a prime example
why Prop. 174 should go into
effect. In May he graduated
from Pitt with a degree in
communications.

“My degree from Pitt makes
me feel like telling the NCAA
‘I told you I could do the
work,”’ Martin said.
“Hopefully I am an example
of how standardized tests
don’t work.”

But Martin was one of the
lucky ones —- his parents
could afford Pitt tuition. What
happens to the kids who score
low on the SATs and their par-
ents can’t afford for them to
go to college? They depend
upon athletics as a means to
enter a university. What do we
say to them? The NCAA has
the answer to those questions.
It is in their hands now.
Hopefully they will make the '
right decision: Do away with
Prop. 16 for a more realistic
Prop. 174.

tant sports editor for The Pitt

the two teams exchanged runs
in the first inning with the
American League scoring
first. With the score tied at one
a piece the National League,
rallied by Jeff Bagwell, scored
three runs in the fourth taking
the lead.

The score would volley
twice more before the
American League took a 7-5
advantage into the bottom of
the ninth.

The trials of the game, until
the ninth inning, were out
done by particular moments
that brought the capacity
crowd at Three Rivers
Stadium to their feet.

The most touching was the
departure of shortstop Ozzie
Smith. Before he left in the
seventh with a man on first,
the Wizzard made a spectacu-
lar play on a shot to his right
that sent him ﬂying to stop the
ball and make the force-out at
second.

It was moments like this that
