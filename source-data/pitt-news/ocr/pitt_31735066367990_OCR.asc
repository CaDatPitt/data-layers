Civil Religion: Shaping
The National Identity

By PEGGY FERRI A

n

A civil religion does exist in this
country according to Rev. Bob
White, director of United Protest-
ant City Ministries, but the
clincher is that civil religion is the
shaper and not the shapee of the
national identity. -

White discussed the peace move-
ment as a response to civil religion
in his presentation before Pitt’s
Arms Race Study Group. The
group meets every Tuesday at noon
in the English department to dis-
cuss different aspects of the threat
of nuclear war and other related
concerns.

“Civil religion,” he said, “has
been described by sociologists as
the common religion of the Ameri-
can way of life—the embodiment
of central American values such as
the belief in progress, the dignity of
the individual, social justice, polit-
ical democracy, religious toler-
ance, restraint in outward conduct
and thrift. Comingled with these
values are the traditional Jewish
and Christian symbols and
expressions.”

White contends that, contrary to
the beliefs of other scholars and
religious historians, America has a
civil religion‘, but its principles do

Sharon Goedart and
Gerald Kowalski are two
new members of the admin-

students, they are making
the adjustment to life on the
campus of a major
university.

“The first thing that hits
you is the diversity of the stu-
dent population,” said
Kowalski, referring to the
wide range of cultural and
ethnic backgrounds, as well
as educational interests.

At Pitt, Kowalski's

-responsibilities involve the

health, safety and security,
as well as judicial aspects of
residence life. His position
requires that he work closely
with both students and
administration.

“You kind of walk a tigh-
trope between administra-
tive concerns and student
needs,” Kowalski said.
“There are the administra-
tive responsibilities of
implementing policy but
also the need to be a student

the American religious who estab-

White addressed those principles
to demonstrate that civil religion is
not found where belief in progress,
the dignity of the individual, social
justice, political democracy or reli-
gious tolerance is found.

“As a pastor, _I see that the simple
life, not the belief in progress, is
fundamental to the American reli-
gious,” White said. “The dignity
of the individual is important but
not as important as the commun-
ity. This sense of community is the
condition needed for groups of
likemindedness, such as Falwell
and his followers, to exist,” White
said later.

“Whoever wants to understand
civil religion has to also under-
stand how the conservative evange-
lists define civil religion,” he
added. L

he later said that evangelists are
not "a bad people,” but that their
ideas are developed in communi-
ties of likemindedness.

“They want to be who they are

Teaching Fellowships: A Unique Experience

By LAURIE MacLEOD

Teachers and students can
share a unique teaching
experience at Pitt through
Undergraduate Teaching
Fellowships offered by the
Honors Program and Office
of Faculty Development.

Undergraduate Teaching
Fellowships are chancellor’s
awards ‘given for joint
student-faculty teaching
projects. They are awarded
to undergraduate students
sponsored by and working
with a full-time faculty
member. ‘

To apply, joint applica-
tion must be made by the

student and the sponsoring
faculty member:

0 The sponsoring faculty
member must submitga 2-3-
page nomination of the stu-
dent for the joint project;

I The student must sub-
mit a 2-3-page letter outlin-
ing the proposed teaching
project;

0 Another faculty member
must submit a letter of
recommendation; V

O The sponsoring faculty
member and the student
must submit a summary
page detailing the actual
activities the fellow will
perform.

The faculty member and
the teaching fellow can

jointly teach an existing
course or a new one can be
made up, according to Barry
Applbaum, coordinator of
honors advising.

The proposal submitted
by the student and the
faculty member is then
reviewed by a committee

established by the Honors
‘‘I would like to see

more people
involved in the
program.

Programs and Office of
Faculty Development.
Twelve teaching fellow-
ships are available each
term. Each teaching fellow

will be awarded $500 for
implementing the proposed
project and it‘may be used
for any expenses entailed in
the project.

A successful proposal will
show that the result of the
student-faculty collabora-
tion will be a unique teach-
ing experience. No awards
will be made to projects in
which the student is merely a
teaching assistant, accord-
ing to Applbaum.

He said awards are not
just for the College of Arts
and Sciences, but for the
other undergraduate schools
of the university. A student
does not have to major in the
subject but

should have

some background.

He said some examples of
projects done in the past are
special demonstration pro-
jects, such as playing games
in political science classes
and running computer labs
in classes where they are not
normally used.

“I would like to see more
people get involved in the
program,” Applbaum said.

He said they have not been
able to, give the total 12
awards that are available
because many students are
unaware of this program.

Applbaum said this is one
of the few merit-based
awards given to undergradu-
ates already enrolled.

By LYNNE LAC EY

Consider these statistics:

5 The cost of Pitt's basic
undergraduate, full-time tui-
tion has been steadily climbing
for the last eight years. The last
time that tuition remained the
same was between the 1973-74
and 1974-75 academic years.

0 In 1982 alone, the cost of an
average text book increased by
--10.0 percent.

0 In every year since 1976, the
rental price for an average two-
man dorm room on campus has
increased by 11 percent.

What is Pitt doing to help
needy students combat these
continually escalating costs?

According to Dan May, asso-
ciate director for student aid
operations, Pitt offers a wealth
of scholarships to qualifying
students.

Funds for student assistance
total $2.8 million this year, with
much of this money earmarked

ships.

The undergraduate scholar-
ship program is divided into
three main categories consist-
ing of academic, special pro-
grams for students and athletic
scholarships. Two other groups
are a general scholarship fund
and a type of federal assistance
fund.

Academic scholarships com-
prise about 30 percent of the
awards given. These fall into

for undergraduate scholar-’

three separate programs; Chan-
cellor Scholars, Provost Scho-
lars and Merit Scholars.

.Only the academically elite
can become Chancellor Scho-
lars, having all tuition, room
and board and additional fees
(books, etc.) paid for themi

The admissions office recom-
mends a Chancellor Scholar-

 

ship candidate to a special
selection committee, which
then choses the recipients.

Another academic award is
the Provost Scholarship. This
program honors students who
demonstrate exceptional ability
academically.

The awardees of the final two
academic scholarship programs
are selected by the office of
Admissions and Financial Aid.

Provost Scholars are charac-
terized as students with except-
ionalability and Merit Scholars

Pitt Scholarships:

Money Here AtHome

are thought to be highly com-
petitive students.

Both programs provide a var-
iety of financial assistance and
evaluate awardees on the basis
of college board scores, class
ranking and recommendations.

May estimates that 40 percent
of Pitt's undergraduate scholar-
ships are awarded under the
Special Programs For Students.
If a student qualifies for one of
these programs and shows a
financial need, aid is awarded
through Special Programs For
Students Funds.

Three programs in the Spe-
cial Program For Students that
entitle qualifying students. to
financial aid are the New
Careers Program, the Univer-
sity Community Educational
Program (UCEP) and the Pitt
Engineering Impact Program
(PEIP).

The New Careers Program is
for students who are 25 or older
and are working toward a bac-
calaureate degree. UCEP assists
young, minority high school
graduates. PEIP gives minority
and disadvantaged students an
opportunity that they normally
would not get to enter the engi-
neering field. '

Athletic scholarships
account for 15 percent of the
scholarships given. Awards are
based purely on athletic ability
in one particular sport.

“When most people think of ‘

athletic scholarships, they just
think of basketball and foot-

ball, the Class-A ones,” May
said.

Class-A scholarships pay tui-
tion, room and board and fees.

May continued, “What they
don't realize is that many scho-
larships for tuition or room and
board are given to non-revenue
sports as well.” “

Both men’s and women’s
non-revenue sports receive a
variety of scholarships, ranging
from tuition scholarships to
partial scholarships covering
room and board.

Financial aid funds are also
distributed through two other
lesser known but equally
important scholarship funds.

One is a type of general scho-
larship fund that covers a broad
base of student activities, with
many of these based on ‘agree-
ments between the university
and a private groups and
organizations. I

U.S. Steel and the Western
Pennsylvania Golf Association
are just two of the groups who
match financial aid funds with
Pitt to help needy students. The
debate team is also partially
supported through this general
scholarship fund.

.The final 5 percent of the
scholarship money is used to
assist federally sponsored cam-
pus programs which are cur-
rently experiencing cuts in
federal funding.

“By subsidizing these federal
programs, we are includingjust
about everyone who was
excluded from the other scho-
larship programs. We haven’t
forgotten anyone,” May said.

Anyone interested in one of
the above programs should con-
tact the Office of Admissions
and Student Aid (X5767) to
make an appointment with a
counselor. —

If tuition is increased next year,
it won't be announced until the
summer. But determining Pitt's
budget for fiscal year 1983 is a pro-

cess that actually begins next
month.
The univerity receives funds

from two sources: state appropria-
tions and tuition.

Each September, the university
submits its state budget request for
the next fiscal year to the depart-
ment of education. That budget
request is based, in part, on enroll-
ment, revenue and budget projec-
tions for the next fiscal year.

The Department of Education
and the State Council on Higher
Education will hold budget hear-

ings in October at which university
representatives will present the
university's budget request.

The state Board of Education
and the secretary of education sub-
mit to the governor's budget office
their recommendations on how
much state funding the university
should receive. '

In February, the governor’s
office develops the executive
budget and-presents it to the Gen-
eral Assembly.

House and Senate Committees
will usually hold hearings the next
month to allow the university to
explain its funding request. At past
hearings, legislators have ques-
tioned faculty benefits, medical

Following the budget hearings,
an appropriations bill is intro-
duced, considered and passed by
the General Assembly for the fiscal
year beginning July 1.

 

But the state request is only part
of the budget cycle. The university
also conducts an internal planning
and budget review for areas in the
university.

The heads of academic, adminis-
trative offices and regional cam-
puses in September submit
information about their area to the
University Office of Planning and
Budget in July. That office reviews
with the heads of the departments
their requests.

In September, the Office of Plan-
ning and Budget develops a pre-
limary base budget, based
on budget reviews, comments by
the Planning and Budget Review
Panel, and projected income and

The Artful Rejuvenation of Childhood

By MICHAEL ROKNICK

There are days when things
slow down and doing anything
requires a maximum effort.
Those days are usually spent in
putting off doing the chores
that absolutely have to be done.
These include homework,

laundry, cleaning the living
area and anything else that has
been put off for too long.

.4‘-D * '
-aw’

it mama seat: that all these
kind of days, one should be
busy with the essential ele-
ments of life. However, the con-
tention can be made that on
those days, it is better to
approach the pressing prob-
lems of labor. Why not, the con-
tention goes, just live in a small
magical moment of play and
regress to the days of child-
hood? Why not be irresponsi-
ble, childish, and just plain
crazy?

In order to prove this theory,
an experiment was conducted
to see if it is indeed possible to
regress to our childhood days.
So with camera and notebook
in hand, an excursion was

made to Schenley Park to prove
o r dis p r o v e
hypothesis.

the above

   

The journey began at the
Student Union, a good place to
begin when one wants to
regress. The lobby seemed to be
full of people — who were
involved in different types of
therapy. Among the most pop-
ular were sleeping, est and drug
therapy.

However, the results from the
varied therapies appeared to be

lhebttelusive; The sleepers were
too involved to know if they
were regressing. The est thera-
pists were to degraded to tell of
their experience. The people
with drugs?Well 

The walk to Schenley was, by
itself, uneventful. Crossing the
bridge was suspenseful. The
suspense: would the bridge
hold the weight of anything
above a peanut?

The park was eventually
reached and the odyssey began.
Phipps conservatory offers an
ideal place to think about the
younger years of life. The vege-
tation draws one closer to
nature and the primal element
in all human beings. It also
makes it easier to forget about
the report that is due tomorrow.
But the thoughts of care-free

days begins to be injected into
the blood stream. And soon, it
gets harder to remember the
reality of the world. Time is no
longer thought of as, “How
long do I have?” but instead,
“How long will it last?” The
walk continues.

It appears that the vegetation
has changed its form as the
walk carries into the outside of
the conservatory. The view
reveals a pond that has lily pads
with goldfish swimming
below. The fish group them-
selves so that they are all well
protected. The daring ones lead
others to new locations that
offer a better view of humans
looking at them.

It is at this point that the
regression begins to take its first
noticeable effects. No longer is
there the worry or the frustra-
tion that something might be
amiss. There is only the simple
joy of looking at something
that has been around for years,
but were too busy to look at
before this moment. The walk
continues.

Soon trees that bear crab
apples are passed and are seen

and just plain crazy?

with younger lookingeyes. The
wrinkles begin to disappear
while thoughts of throwing
one of the small apples over a
bridge are formed in the mind.
The irresponsible mind begins
to’ take over. The walk
continues.

The main objective has been
reached, the playground of the
park. It has all the sources
needed to regress to childhood.
The sight of a firetruck draws
the males while the big shoe
attracts the women. In sitting
down in the driver's seat, the

‘ feeling of power is overwhelm-

ing. For it is in the firetrucks
that little boys have their high-
est motiviation in dreams. The
thought of hearing the siren,
the dash through the city trying
to get to the burning building,
the saving of a life while in
danger.

While these thoughts are
entering the boy’s mind, the
girl begins to dream her own
dreams. The shoe brings to
mind the tale of the woman

who had “so many children she
didn't know what to do.” The
girl begins to think of the time
when she will be able to wear
the jewelry and clothes her
older sister wears. She thinks of
the day when that special boy
will ask her out for that first
date.

But while the girl was think-
ing, a strange occurrence has

taken place. The boy, in every

sense of the word “reality,” has
become a boy. That is, he has
become physically, emotion-
ally and psychologically a boy.
He runs over to the globe with
the circular sliding board sur-
rounding it and begins to play
free spirit. He no longer has the
responsibilities of adulthood
and can for, the first time in a
long while, play with abandon.
He peeks through the globe to
look at the outside world. The
view is touched with shades of
innocence. .

The world no longer holds
the tragedy of the adult mind. It

 

has grown new and imagina-
tive thoughts in the small boy’s
mind. He can be or do anything
he wants in his world, without
having any time element
involved in his decision. That
is because he knows that he will
always be young.

The girl watches in amaze-
ment as she has seen the man
turn into a little boy. She knows

what he is, but doesn’t know
how he became that way. She
waits for his return to the real
world.

The boy does return to the
world as his adult mind knows
and remembers it. He goes
through no withdraw] and the
only side effect is that he knows
it was a dream. But it-was a
dream that was well worth act-
ing out.

The advice that the boy gives
is something that can be
remembered occasionally.
When the deadlines are mount-
ing, it may be advisable to take
a time out.

The Student Governmental
Relations Committee, Pitt's stu-
dent lobbyists, are reviving a state-
wide university organization and
planning lobby trips for this year.

'The committee is currently try-
ing to reorganize the Pennsylvania
Student Association of State
Related Universities which
includes: Pitt, Penn State, Lincoln
and Temple University, according
to Governmental Relations Com-
mittee chairperson Connie
Kreischer.

Kreischer said the organization
was inactive for the last several
years.

“It’s important to revive the
organization so the state related’
schools will have more influence
across the state,” she said. “It will
also give us a large constituency to
work with: we1l.over 100,000 stu-
dents,“ she said.

According to Kreischer, in the
past the committee has lobbied to
increase the amount of money Pitt
will receive each year.

“We lobby for large appropria-
tions for Pitt to reduce the tuition,”
she said.

Last March the committee lob-
bied in ' Washington on‘ the
National Student Action Day. Five

thousand students participated for
the prevention of Student Aid cuts,
according to Kreischer.

She said in Washington, the
committee attended a Conference

“We argued against studentaid
cuts and tried to persuade them to
vote against the cuts," she said.

Kreischer said she thought that
lobby trip was successful “because

of the United States Student Asso-
ciation, attended workshops on
lobbying techniques and went t.o
Capitol Hill to meet with congress-
men and senators from the Pitts-
burgh area.

 

last month a veto was over-ridden
in the house to set levels of fund-
ing. And student. aid this year was
kept at the same level as 1982."
The committee is now watching
congress for a new bill which

would enable congress to approve
changes in eligibility for PELL
grants, according to Kreischer.

She said in the past the Depart-
ment of Education published the
eligil)i_lity changes and allowed
thirty days for a response before the
eligibility was changed.

The committee wants this bill to
be passed because it would make it
harder for the'I)epartment of Edu-
cation to change the PELL eligi-
bility, Kreischer said.

The committee also plans to go
to Washington in October to
attend a Conference of State Stu-
dent Organizations to strenghten
the state student lobbying
organizations.

"If the house is out of sessionat
this time we won’t be able to
lobby,” she said.

She said this year the committee
will lobby for a possible bill that
will enable graduate students to
receive cPHF.AA (Pennsylvania
Higher Education Assistance Asso-
ciation) grants which they were not
eligible for in the past.

Kreischer said this will help if

the guaranteed student loan is

taken away from graduate stu-
dents. Student aid cuts is the big-
gest issue the committee deals with
now.

She said she thought student

have been

“Before student aid cuts became
the big issue we lobbied for lower-

- . .5 - . .
..ing the‘drrnki.ng age and decr1mi-

nilization,” she said.

Kreischer said she thinks the lob-

bying group has an effect because it

shows the legislators that the stu- I

dents are watching an(l interested
and it puts pressure on them to
listen.

“For every national organization‘

_1_il<_e_ this. you need grass roots in
local areas,” she said. “It takes a lot
of. little organizations to make it
big!) ,

Kreischer also said a lobbying
group gets its power from either
nun‘ er of voters or ‘through
money. “Since we don't have much
money we rely on students to vote.”

“This is the one drawback that
gets thrown back in our faces,” she
said.

The student lobbying group
meets one on one with state legisla-
tors in -Harrisburg to show where

a
K

_ students stand on issues and to per-

suade legislators to support stu-
dents. The cornmittee consists of
undergraduate students who are
concerned with government and
what they are doing.

“The major reason why people
join is they realize if they don’t
speak up things may get cut from
under them," Kreischer said.

Opinion

Poll

A national public-opinion
survey has found that people
would rather see drastic cuts in
federal funds for defense than
cuts in support for higher
education.

Only 15 percent of the people
surveyed said aid to higher edu-
cation should be cut drastically

and 22 percent favored drastic
cuts in defense spending.

.More than three quarters of
the people surveyed favored
continued federal support for
low-interest loans to middle-
income students and 70 percent
favored continued federal
grants to low-income students,
according to a_ preliminary
report of the survey findings.

A majority of people polled
favored continued support of
university research in medicine
and natural sciences. Less sup-
port for continued aid was
given to the arts and
humanities.

Crime

Here is a list of some of the
crimes reported in the cam-
pus area last week:

Sept. 21: A female student
had her bike stolen at the
Bellefield side of the Cathe-
dral of.Learning. She had
locked her Schwinn 10-
speed up and when she had
returned, itwas gone.

Sept. 22: A female student
was studying on the third
floor of Hillman Library.
She looked up to find a man
indecently exposing
himself.

Sept. 22: When a woman
left her office on the 28th
Floor of the Cathedral of
Learning, she _left a cassette
recorder and a pocket calcu-
lator unattended. Both were
stolen from her office.

Sept. 23: Two male stu-
dent of the fifth floor of
Bruce Hall were lighting
paper near a smoke detector,
summoning the Pittsburgh
Fire Department and the
campus police. The students
were taken before the judi-
cial board.

Sept. 24: A male dental
student 1eft.his lab on the
fourth floor of Salk Hall. He
left behind _-.some dental
instruments unattended,
which were stolen.

Sept. 24: An unidentified
man threatened one of the
Towers attendents with
physical harm_. He had been
arrested twice in the past for
defiant trespassing. The case

is now under investigation.’

Sept. 26: ' Two university
students, residents of sixth
floor Bruce Hall, will be
taken before the judicial
board for tampering with
fire aparatus. They dis-
charged the fire extin-
guisher, which in turn set off
the fire alarms.

them together," he explained.
“The people we are talking about
will also not tolerate leveling or
accomodate pluralism,” he said.

According to White, fascism as
an expression of evangelistic impe-
rialism becomes a legitimate polit-
ical movement when there is a
failure of respect for others and
pluralism becomes fragmented.

“The result is distortion,” White
said. “Part of your theology then
resembles national chauvanism
and the actions of the United States
become synonomous with the ful-
fillment of prophecy.”

He added that playing on the
fears and insecurities of others is an
evangelical phenomenon that
serves to energize fascism. People
are easily manipulated as the situa-
tion in America worsens.

“In the end,” he said, “the fail-
ure of the peace movement has
been that it doesn't take the power
and influence of religious America
very seriously. The peace move-
ment needs to respect the tradition
of religious America and respect
their activists.

“Some of the most effective and
forceful social activists come from
the evangelical tradition,” he said.
“Their religious concern is to
question the state and their values
are that which could retard runa-
way technology. These people pos-
sess the convictions to be
peacemakers, and not all—in fact,
very few—are like the evangelists
we see so much of today in the
media."

PELLGrants

A House-Senate conference
last week approved a bill that
would bar major changes in
eligibility for the 1983-84 aca-
demic year.

This will require the depart-
ment to use the same Pell grant
standards in 1983-84 that were
used this year, with some
changes to compensate for
inflation.

The bill is designed to avoid
delays in distributing student
aid next year by requiring the
same standards to be used again
in 1984-85 if the Department of
Education fails to submit new
rules by next April 1.

Direct Loan

Student loans have been given a
bad name because of the National
Direct Student Loan-—the smaller
of two federal student loan pro-
grams, says Thomas R. Wolanin, a
former staff director of the House
Subcommittee on Post Secondary
Education. .

Wolanin said that the elimina-
tion of direct loans would solve this
problem.

The default rate on direct loans
is 16 percent compared to an 8 per-

cent rate on Guaranteed Student
Loans.

Guaranteed Student Loaiis are
made and coll'ect'e‘d'iby‘commericial
banks which receive a federal inter-
est subsidy.

Direct loans are awarded and col-
lected by college officials, with
money appropriated by Congress
and funds collected from past
borrowers.

Wolanin said to use money col-
lected from old loans for a Supple-
mental Education Opportunity
Grant Program. He also recom-

  Unemployed
  But  
Educated

Wesley Posvar had it tough from the very
beginning.

Our very own chancellor once had a job in a
factory making gaskets at 25 cents an hour. Posvar
was quoted in a_ local paper as saying it was the worst
job he’s ever had.

But he said the whole nasty experience made him
appreciate the value of an education.

“...the importance of education is that it helps a
young man.‘or woman find and achieve his or her
potential in a job that gives the greatest personal
gratification,” Posvar said in the article.

Well, not quite. This is not to suggest that the
chancellor is the slightest bit out of touch, but we
can’t help noticing that there are large numbers of
college graduates (most likely the ones with liberal
arts degrees) who would give their right arms to
make gaskets. _

Consider the situation in Hempstead, Long
Island this week. Marriott Hotels Inc. was hiring
staff for a hotel it was building near the Nassau
Coliseum. The company had 296jobs ranging from
dishwashers to desk clerks, but a hotel spokesman
said that over 4,000 people, many of them “highly
qualified” showed up to compete for the jobs. -

Present among them, according to hotel
employees who conducted the job interviews, were
colleges -graduates with liberal arts degrees (sur-
prise), former teachers and women who wanted to
return to the werkteree. i

There have been other such stories in the press
lately about thousands of people lining up for a few
possible, menial jobs. There are also shades of
“Grapes of Wrath” in the tales. being spread about
the abundance of work in Houston. Not only is work ,
not plentiful, but Texas’ welfare program is one of
the skimpiest in the country. It got to the point
where nationally syndicated columnists such as Bob
Greene began writing columns warning people’
about the hoaxes. ~ '

Now of course, “Doonesbury” is dealing with the
delicate subject of a senior attempting to cope with
the panic of knowing that in nine short months,
he’ll'be out on the streets. Little wonder.that “Doo-
nesbury” is so popular with college students.

This is not to blame the chancellor for the state of
the country’s job market. There is enough to blame
the chancellor for without resorting to that. We just
think he should be more careful when he divulges to
the local paper how education prepares you for a job

"that will provide “the greatest personal gratifica-
tion.”_ Tell that to the 1981 graduates who are wash-
ing dishes, standing in line and listening to tall tales
about Texas. '

Jew, Zionist: Differences

Dear Editor:

As director of the University of
Pittsburgh Chapter of Masada, I
was very much confused by Tho-
mas Daniels’ letter in Wednesday's
Pitt News, “On the Brink of Catas-
trophe." Mr. Daniels writes at
length about Jews and Zionists. It
is evident to me that there is much
confusion as to what is a Zionist.
Since the image of both the Jew
and the Zionist have changed over
time, I will handle these separately.

What is a Jew? A Jew is a
member of a large probiscused race
which has a desire for world domi-
nation. A Jew is a person who is
responsible for killing Christ. Per-
haps above all else, a Jew has an
innate and insurmountable drive
for making money, as was duly
noted in Mr. Daniels’ letter. The
Jews have been responsible for
starting two world wards and, as
everybody knows, the Jews control
the banks and the press. This last
fact was attested to by General
Brown of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

Now that you have a clear under-
standing of what a Jew is let us try
to understand what a Zionist is. A
Zionist is a member ofa large prob-
iscused race which has a desire for
world domination. A Zionist is a
person who is responsible for the
killing of Christ. Instead of having
an innate and insurmountable
drive for making money, a Zionist
had an innate and insurmountable
drive towards imperialism (which,

in the words of Lenin, is the high-
est form of capitalism), as duly
noted by Mr. Daniels; The Zionists
have been responsible for starting
two world ward and of course eve-
rybody knows that. the Zionists
control the press and the banks.

I shall discuss this unique sini-
ilarity between Jew atid Zionist
further on in this letter. I’d first like
to defend my definitions. I am not
in the habit of stating baseless defi-
nitions. As I’m sure is true of Mr.‘
Daniels, I too am well read. My
definitions come from such highly
respected publications as “Mein
Kampf" and the “Protocols of the
Elders of Zion”; publications
which have elicited the public
praise of Nasser of Egypt, Arif of
Iraq and Faisal of Saudi Arabia. If
you find these sources unappealing
merely because they wereiauthored
by such people as Adolf Hitler or
the Tsar’s secret police, you can
look to the great religious writings
of Martin Luther or of the Moslem
Hadith, which states, “A Jew will
not be found alone with a Muslim
without plotting to kill him.”

Mr. Daniels does not stand alone
in his “just” feelings about Jews
and Zionists but rather stands with
such great humanitarians as Adolf
Hitler and the Ayatollah Kho-
meini, who recently stated, “It is
our duty to reveal this treachery
and to shout at the/topofour voices
until people understand that the
Jews and their foreign masters are
plotting...and preparing the way

for Jews to rule over the entire
planet.” Mr. Daniels, you shout
very well! V.

What is the difference between
Jews and Zionists? The PL(),
surely the most expert group on
Zionism, has a very easy way to
identify Zionists. At the time of the
Entebe hi—jacking they separated
the Zionists by using Dr. Mengele’s
method: Jews to the right, Gentiles
to the left. All those on the left are
not Zionists and therefore able to be
released.

Mr. Daniels, you were too hasty

in writing your letter. You forgot
to say that it was the Zionists who
have a “will towards excessive
wealth and profit” and not the
Jews. You have given the illusion
that they are one and the same and
that you are, God forbid, anti-
semitic.
Youifinish your letter by stating,
we must all work and pray to
quell the sources of disparity in the
world before it is too late for us
all.” If only you were as eloquent
and as open as Martin Luther. He
finished his diatribe with the
words, “To sum up, dear princes
and nobles who have Jews in your
domains, if this advice of mine does
not suit you, then find a better one
so that you and we may all be free of
this insufferable devilish burden-
the Jews.

Football Turns To Fantasizing

By BARRY ZASLOFF

Dearest Editor:

James Michener once wrote that
sports should provide relief from
tensions, act as a “joyful exuber-
ance as the game progresses" and
serve to “discharge the aggressions
which, if kept bottled up. damage
the human being." Other writers,
such as Michael Novak, argue that
sports are an escape from the
drudgery of everyday work.

Releasing tensions? A means of
escape? I journeyed the path last
Monday night, turning on the tele-
vision to drift through a football
game. I never reached Michener’s
or l\'ovak’s fantasy worlds. Talk of
strikes, negotiations, arbitration,
unions and -possible settlements
blocked my entrance.

Rather than observing a defen-
sive unit battling an offensive line
or a swift wide receiver defying
gravity with a leaping catch. I wit-
nessed a court of law setting, with
representatives from the NFL and
the pro football Players Associa-

tion engaging in their own little
debate.

I was interrupted from the nor-
mal halftime routine featuring
highlights of the previous day's
action. Instead of watching passes
from Fours to Winslow or Brad-
shaw to Stallworth, I saw player

 

representative Ed Garvey and NFL
attorney Jack Doiilaii tossing
something back and forth.
['iifortun:itely, it wasn't a foot-
ball, rather. it was the NFL season.
()n one side of the field was the
players, who have set a goal, a des-

tination to reach. Opposite them,
the owners, who are willing to
bend a little, but not nearly as
much as the players want them to.
The two sides, it appears, are
more than 100 yards apart. Neither
are willing to drop back 10 yards
and punt the ball. The players
want a rather tidy sum of the televi-
sion revenues, the right to free
agency and salary increases. The
"owners have offered concessions,
but not enough to bring the players
into their territory.
. The exact figures are not the
155119 here; the nagging feeling that
sports are no lotiger an avenue for
escape is. Even on a big business
level, sports can be a way of releas-
ing tension, of briefly setting aside
the pressures associated with every-
day life. '
But that point stretches only so
far before it snags. The players and
ownershave flat out tom the con-
cept into shreds. As in most strikes,
nobody wins. Especially those
individuals who look to sports in
general, and football in particular,
as a pleasure-seekiiig trip.

Socrates: Out Of Work

so)

By STEVE PARKS

Due to recent Reagan budget
cuts in college funds, the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh is forced to make
cutbacks. Among these cutbacks is
the renowned philosopher
Socrates. Once a key’ member ofthe
Philosophy department, he is now
forced onto unemployment.

Place: Unemployment Office

Time: Recession

All eyes turn their attention to
the struggle taking place at the
doorway. A bearded man is fiercely
battling the revolving door for pos-
session of his toga. At last the cloth
rips, sending the man sprawling
across the floor.

“Hey Bo-Peep, where are your
sheep?” a man asks to the enjoy-
ment of the whole room.

“Could you tell me where to
apply for unemployment?”

Socrates asks, glancing up from the _

floor.

“Line three-b,” a man said, step-
ping over him.

“Thank you," replied Socrates,
heading for the back of the line. By
the time he reached the end, he was
out of breath and out of doors!

“Quite a long line, eh?” said a
man in a black and white striped
shirt. “Say, you must bevhard-up,
wearing bed sheets for clothes!”

“Do I have to dress like you to get
this unemployment?” panted
Socrates, noticing the line con-
sisted mainly of men, wearing
striped shirts.

“No,” he answered, “we’re refe-
rees for the NFL, and out of work
’cause of the strike.” The referee
went on to explain his life story of

By scorr REX

The bourgeois revolutionary
protests the fact that he is not part
of the working class. He is lost in
the world of black and white, us
against them. Showing his ability
to grasp the complexities of inter-
national and national politics, he
lumps his enemies into one mono-
lithic group. There is no difference
between Student Government, The
Pitt Board of Trustees, the presi-
dent, apple pie, the marine corps or
Ford. To the university radical, the
word nuance does not apply.

He calls his school a home for
the elite, one of the most expensive
in the country. Not judging statis-
tics, let me welcome him as a fellow
elite. Not having been able to recall
the hawkish "rhetoric of john F.
Kennedy, he states that Reagan is
akin to Truman. What is his idea of
a liberal President? Lyndon John-
son who had North Vietnam
bombed, or Nixon who had Cam-
bodia bombed, or President Carter
who supported Somoza. But this is
1982 and his ideas are fresh as a
moldy crust of bread. In the State of

unemployment to take a trip to

about his wild extra-marital

“Why thank you. Would you

“Dependents?” she asked, obliv-

“Forty five,” he answered, flash-

“Then you'll receive $180 a week
for thirty weeks,” she said, her own
goodness swelling in her heart.

“Could you send my checks to

Socrates strolled to the window.

“Is this where I get...”

“Name?" she asked, coldly
ignoring his question.
“Socrates.”

“First name?"

“That’s my whole name,” he

“University of Pittsburgh. I
philosophized on what justice
was!” he answered proudly.

“I’m not surpised you got laid
off,” she answered dryly.

“Yes, Washington doesn't seem
to care about justice anymore,”
answered Socrates, smiling to
himself.

“Dependents?” she asked ang-
rily, fed up with his nonsense.

“All college students.”

“Right,” she answered
sarcastically.
“Good, then you agree!"

Socrates announced triumphantly.
“Look,” she shouted, “Get lost!

bad name. Thanks to Reagan,
we’re cracking down on cheats like
you. Now go and count your bless-

Socrates turned and slowly wan-

of his blessings: such a great presi-

unemployment system; a more cost

tantly, an empty park bench to
sleep on!

we stand for. The only thing I can
tell you is this: Tom Hayden is 42
and he is now running for the Cali-
fornia state legislator. Without a
doubt, he was the most intelligent
student radical of the l960’s. In
your wildest dreams, you could
never accomplish what he was able
to do. Why don't all the radicals on

this campus do themselves a favor, '

and take some lessons from Tom
Hayden. just think of all those
years you could have saved
yourself.

Dear Editor:

This letter is in response to Mon-
day’s article entitled, “Rush and
Pledge Ideas From a Caveman’s
Wall,” written by Mark Sindler. As
sorority members and former
rushees, we disagree strongly with
Mr. Sindler.

First, we would like to clear up
the misconceptions that Mr.
Sindler has expressed about the
IFC—Panhellenic Rush system. Mr.
Sindler states that the fraternities
are not under thejurisdiction of the
university. That may be true of the
individual fraternity houses. How-
ever, the Greek letter organizations
set up their rush activities with the
guidance of the IFC and the Pan-
hellenic Association, which in turn
are guided by the Office of Student
Activities.

Mr. Sindler also comments on
the effect of “the intense concentra-
tion of partying during Septem-
ber.” The sorority rush system is
made up of a series of parties
designed to introduce the rushees
to all of the sororities on campus.
There were six nights of rush par-
ties within an eleven day period.
However, none of these parties are
mandatory for rushees. The IFC
does not set minimum party
attendance requirements for their
male rushees. In both systems, the
rushee decides for him or herself
which parties he or she can attend.
It is up to the rushee to decide how
much time they can give up to
attend rush events.

As to the suggestion to extend
the rush period to include all of the
fall term, it is obvious to us that Mr.
Sindler has not thoughtabout the
consequences of this action. He
apparently feels that a longer rush
period will make the decision of
which group to join easier for
rushees. But he has not considered
the long-term effects of having a

and a half months.

The Greek members would be
required to put more time and
effort into rush than they do now,
with the current system. Their
studies would suffer, as would
those of freshmen who had parties
to attend every weekend. The
rushees would find themselves
growing tired of so many parties
and so little involvement with the
actual workings of the Greek

‘society. An extended rushing

period would prove too expensive»

rush which lasts for nearly three.

More Than A Free Beer

for the sororities and fraternities
themselves._ _ O

Holding pledging only during
winter term would create problems
with our Greek Week activities.
Since we would be educating our
pledges, we would have less time to
devote to charity, and isn't that
what Greek Week is about? It sure
is. This suggestion of Mr. Sindler’s
would cause us to have to give up
winter rush altogether. It is
extremely difficult to conduct rush
activities with groups of pledges
who know very little about rushing
and the Greek system.

No one ever said pledging was a
breeze. It is a very serious part of
becoming Greek. This is a time
when pledges learn about their
chosen organization. During this
period, pledges are helped and

encouraged by ‘their_ fellow
members to keep up with their

studies. Speaking for our sorority,
we have strict grade requirements
for initiation. We require our
pledges to study a few hours a week
along with the sisters. The major-
ity of Pitt’s Greeks including our-
selves, were fall term pledges and
we have survived. q

We feel that Mr. Sindler’s com-
ment about Greeks being con-
cerned with quantity and not
quality is highly unfair. The
Greeks at Pitt make up only a small
portion of the total student body.
The whole idea of rush is to meet
and observe rushees to see if they
have the qualities necessary to
become Greek. The Greek system is
more than just socializing and free
beer on the weekends, which is
something Mr. Sindler appears to
have overlooked. Greek life is ser-
vice to the university and the com-
munity. Quantity alone can never
uphold these traditions. Many
Greeks go on to become influential
executives in our society, and also
many past presidents of our nation
were Greeks. ‘

With the solutions Mr. Sindler
proposes, the Greek system would
suffer severely. The student body
would also suffer the lack of a
chance for the personal growth
offered by the Greeks. Are the sug-
gestions of Mr. Sindler about reor-
ganizing the Greek Rush system or
undermining an important and
valuable aspect of college life?

Making It All The Way Home

By JIM HOHMAN

“What the hell am I doing
here?!” That's what I kept asking
myself during the 30-minute wait
for Sunday’s Great Race to begin.
To understand my anxieties at that
time, you should know my
situation.

When I first came to Pitt from
Erie, I made friends with my next
door neighbor in Tower B. One
night, he announced to a group of
us that he wanted to run a mile or
two. No one else seemed interested,
so I volunteered to tag along. Why
not? I needed the exercise after a

day of sitting down. I warned him,"

that I had never run before and was
out of shape. ' -~
He dragged me along for about
two miles and while running, told
me about running" in the Great.
Race last year..'He told me that i-t
was terrific and that I should run
in it with him this year. Without
thinking, I hastily said, “Sure!” It
sounds as if it would be fun!” Me
and my big mouth!
‘ For. the next month, we ran
almost every other day, and I had

managed to work myself up to a
slow four miles. My friend com-
mented that this year, he’d like to
run the 6.2 miles in 50 minutes. I
just said, “God! I’d just like to fin-
ish.” I had been having bad dreams
about finishing dead last and being
the laughing stock of Pitt, thus my
doubt as to whether I could make it
the whole way.

As we assembled behind the
starting line, I couldn't help notic-
ing all the seasoned runners with
their solid iron legs and $100 run-
ning shoes. I felt further doubt as I
glanced at my worn Ponys.

Then the race started. I over-
paced myself on the first mile and
was exhausted after the second
mile. Luckily, there wasa water
stand, and after a few seconds, I
picked up my pace again.

Well, to end the suspense, yes, I”
did finish. And was damn proud of
myself for doing so! Sure, my time
was very slow —- one hour and
three minutes, which means the
winner had finished while I was
working on the third mile -- but, I
finished!

I wouldn't have though, if it
hadn't been for the other runners
and people watching on the sides.
You felt as if everyone was encour-
aging you to do your best. It was a
great feeling. I especially
remember a group of nuns shout-
ing to the runners who were all
tired after a long grade up the
Boulevard of the Allies in the
fourth mile, “Come on! You've
gotta do it! It's all downhill from
the top on.”

I felt as if I had to pick up his
pace, just to please the nuns. I
wonder if the people watching
realize how much it means to the
runners to have someone cheering
them on. Iwas really surprised at

the number of runners in the race '

and the number of people who
gave up an’ hour’ to watch. It made
me proud to be even just a part-
time riesiderrt of Pittsburgh.» _

Later on, after the race, someone
asked me if I'd run it again tomor-
row, if given the chance. I replied
firmly, “No! Not until Tuesday!”

Increased Exposure Brings

  Changes In How

Homosexuals Treated

Would you vote for someone run-
ning for SGB if you knew_he was
gay? Your answer may QlV€ you
some clues about how homosexual
students are perceived at Pitt, and in
fact, by society in general.

According to Barbara Shore, pro-
fessor in the School of Social Work
and advisor to the Gay and Lesbian
Alliance at Pitt, “it’s rough for homo-
sexuals most every place to pave
their way. They have problems com-
ing out in the open publicly as well as
with friends and family.”

Shore used the word homopho-
bia to describe the attitude some

“always treating that human being
with respect and valuing him or her
as a person.”

According to Sister Bernadette,
the three theological approaches to

i homosexuality are as follows: some

would say it’s an unnatural perver-
sion and morally wrong; some
would say it’s an acceptable option
and even good for certain individu-
als; and some would say it’s essen-
tially imperfect, but that it can be
tolerated for some. .

As far as counseling for homosex-
ual behavior or tendencies, Sister
Bernadette said that ‘a homosexual

Dr. Barbara Shore, fac_ulty adviser to the Gay and Lesbian
Alliance at Pitt

people have about homosexuals.
She said that homophobia is a real
rejection of and strong emotional
reaction against homosexuals
rather that heterosexuals. She also
said that not all cultures are as
homophobic as ours and that it’s
hard to fully understand the extent
or hostility of it.

Part of homophobia stems from
the religious idea that homosexual-
ity is sinful Shore said. When asked
how the University Chaplain’s Asso-
ciation viewed and dealt with homo-
sexuality, Sister Bernadette, who is
chairperson of that organization,
said that “within the campus minis-
try there is no one way to give a
statement because theologies
differ.” .

,_ However, she outlined three
theological approaches to homo-
sexuality, stressing that all of the

A . ministers would take the pastoral
approach when counseling stru-»

dents who are homosexual. She
said that the term pastrgral means

Laughlin Dhoto
tendency is no different that the ten-
dency to get mad.” She said that
behavior might be condemned, but
a person would never be
condemned.

“In their counseling, all of the cha-
plains are aware of the detrimental
effects of prejudice or labeling,” Sis-
ter Bernadette said. “A person’s
identification wouldn’t be limited to
his or her sexual orientation.”

She said that the minister would

try to respond to the real need of the
person and help that person
become what he can. Above all, cha-
plains wouldn’t bring their own opin-
ions into the counseling session and
would refrain from making moral
judgments, according to Sister
Bernadette.

Sister Bernadette said that cha-
plain’s would ask why the person
was upset and then deal with it like
any other issue.

Sister Bernadette stressed that
within the chaplains association

. there is ‘a gamut of positions, but

even within certain faiths, the
approach may differ. In every case,
however, the person is always
treated with the pastoral approach,
or concern for that person.

According to Shore, there has
been some shift in the attitude peo-
ple have about homosexuality. She
said that homosexuality is not
viewed as unusual as it was before
the gay rights movement began, but
that there was a long way to go in
dealing with a lot of negative
attitudes. , A

While people such as Anita Bry-
ant have sparked some negative
responses, on the whole the Gay
Rights movement has enjoyed more
and more popularity during the past
twenty years or so.

The ’60s sparked many move-
ments, and according to Shore, the

‘A homosexual

tendency is no differ-

ent than the ten-

dency to get mad.’

Gay Rights movement took its style
of liberated status from some of
them.

One major breakthrough was the
American Psychiatric Association’s
decision to remove homosexuality
from its list of mental disorders. The
trend to more openness in talking
about sexuality also helped homo-
sexuals gain acceptance.

One of the reasons that homosex-
uals are more visible on college cam-
puses is the fact that for many
people, college is a time for sexual
experimentation. This may lead
some students to question their sex-
uality and possibly seek help.

Shore said that in counseling
homosexuals, counselors at the
Persad Center, located at 121 High-.
land Avenue in East Liberty, help
them decide how they want to deal
with the issue. She said that Persad
doesn’t start from the assumption
that people have to be changed into
heterosexuals.

According to Jim Huggins, direc-
tor of programming for Persad Cen-
ter, the Center was begun in 1972
“because is was hard to find profes-
sional people to deal with sexual
minority people.”

Huggins said that Persad is a com-
preshensive mental health center

where counselors deal with sexual _

minorities. He added that it also has
an educational function.

“Over the years we’ve developed
a lot of expertise in dealing with sex-
ual minorities. We do a lot of com-
munity educational work,” he said.

According to Huggins, people
come to Persad for different rea-
sons. “Some have mental health‘
provlems found anywhere and

‘B"—" ' "i

he said. “Some people can’t handle
being hay and some are just
confused.”

He said that the counselors at

Persad are always non-judgmental
as long as no one is being hurt and
that they don’t push anyone. Hug-
gins also said that not only counsel-
ing is handled at Persad; therapy is
also offered.

Some of the changes that Hug-

gins has seen in how homosexuality

,is

handled are that it is talked about

more frequently and younger gays
are aware of their sexuality earlier
because of access to healthy homo-

’ "‘This creates a different ima ei 

tells young people that you can be
happy and gay at the same time,” he
said.

Huggins pointed out that one of

the ways in which homosexuality
has changed is that it used to be a
crime to engage in homosexual
behavior. This was struck down by
the state supreme courts.

ci

“Philadelphia recently passed a
vil rights ordinance which includes

gays, but Pittsburgh has no such

 la

w,” Huggins said.
Since, according to Huggins,

approximately 10 percent of the
population is gay, the government
council for sexual minorities has
been established. lt is hoped that all
of these measures will increase pub-
lic acceptance of homosexuals, but
the problem is far from being solved.

In dealing with negative attitudes,

Shore said that homosexuals-
shouldn’t blame themselves, should
seek help and should build a support
group for themselves.

organization.

Located at 231 Oakland Avenue
on the third floor, the Gertrude
Stein Community Center provides
information and referrals, as well as
a place for different groups to meet.

The center also has a crisis line,
which can be reached by dialing 683-
9422. It is completely staffed by
volunteers Monday, Wednesday
and Friday from 6 to 9 p.m., and

Saturday from 1 to 5 p.m.

Although Huggins said that the
center offered a place to socialize
other than a bar, a volunteer said
that it served as a contact center for
QBU OTOIIHQ

gay groups.

Another point that Shore made
about counseling homosexuals is
that it is important to differentiate
the negative attitudes
around the individual and what the
person believes is wrong. “The most
important thing is to have a positive

between

self image,” she said.

Dr. Robert Gallagher, director of
the counseling center located in 333
Student Union said that “generally
homosexuals who come in for coun-
seling have similar kinds of prob-
lems as the other. people who come

 RUNNING

Hutchinson Leads

Cross Country
Team On Track

By CHARLIE O‘HARA

With the Panther cross country
season just beginning, many
believe it will be a very difficult
one.

Since former coach Mike Agos'ti-
nella resigned early in the summer,
and new coach John Vasvary
wasn’t hired until September, the
'team1w'as*placed in an awkward
position in preparing for the- fall
season. 1 1

But as -is the case with many.ot
these turmoil»-ridden
there has been a light of hope shed
km the Panther season. It originates

from john Hutchison, a 5-10, 139- 

pound. senior. . c
Having" provided the team with

’ Llasithusiasm -as well asleadership at’

a ‘tiirne when everything could have
fallen apart, Hutchison made sure

‘that everyone knew just how big-a. -

challenge that the team was facing.

~When asked how the events of
the ‘summer affected the team, Hut-
chison said, “There was the antici-
patign. of get'ting_a new coach, but
at the same time "it was tough

because the season was up in the

air."
This effort and inclination to
succeed on Hutchison's part has
gained him quite a bit of respect

' from his new coach.

When Vasvary was asked to eval-
uate Hutchison, he said, “I’m very
impressed. He is a team leader and
a hard worker. I l1aven't seen him
in a race yet, l)ut in practice he
shows a strong willingness to give
the effort needed. He is a bigasset."

Hutchison, who ran varsity for
four years at Butler high school
originallyused running as a device
to get in shape for the basketball
and baseball seasons.

His aspirations for basketball
and baseball were cut short when
success came his way incross coun-
try and track. By his senior year he
had been offered scholarships by
several small colleges in the area,
but only one big school showed
interest—the University of»
Pittsb’ur_gh. v . ‘

. He was not offered a’ scholarship
by ‘Pitt, but instead "the chance to
run Division l_cross-country and-
-track. . - '

In his},=freshman yeaifhe ran var-

_ sity and "was pitoyzided' "With; a.
V memory tha,t'he will never forget;

“It was my first race as afresh-

freshman."

Since then, Hutchison has been a
stronghold for both the Panther
cross country and track teams.

When asked why he chose Pitt,
Hutchisonireplied, “The academ-
ics were much better than what the
other schools had to offer and the
fact that Pitt is so close to home
made it even more attractive."

Concerning his and the team's
future. Hutchison had some words

By MARK A. SINDLER

It is often said that all good
things must come to and end
sooner or later. The Lady Panther
volleyball team, who some could

' say were almost immortal, find this

fact partially true.

Playing in a tri-match against
Duquesne and Youngstown State,
Pitt handily defeated both,’ but at
theexpenseof star spiker Ulana
Kohutiak.

First the good news. Pitt
dropped Duquesne 15-12, 15-13.
Youngstown State did not stand
much of a chance either, bowing
out 15-0,15-12.

And, the bad news. Kohutiak,
who plays middle blocker, suffered
a sprained ankle Saturday and has
not played since. Coach Shelton
Collier earlier revealed that she
will be lost for four to six weeks
with torn ligaments. "

No, it does not spell doom and
disaster for the Lady Panthers, but
it does mean a new regrouping will
be needed.

“We did not play very well last
night, even though we played weak
-teams," Collier stated. “There is no

‘missed. She is usually a great sta-
bilizing force out there, tonight her
absence showed.”

Freshman phenom Carmen
Tapia filled in for Kohutiak from
her outside hitter position, and Pat
Belcher and Sally Gillespie
replaced Tapia.

.Collier made the switches, but
did not like what he saw.

“Sally and Pat didinot fill in very
well," he remarked. Of course, we
only had a one-hour practice prior
to the matches, but the loss of
Ulana has shaken the team’s
confidence.”

Collier instituted a new offensive
system which may have also been a
factor in the team’s poor play.
Ordinarily the Lady Panthers play
a high percentage game——-higher
sets are established so players can
hit the ball harder.

But last night, the Lady Panthers
had to respond to a quicker and
more deceptive offense with
quicker sets. As a result, problems
arose.

Tapia, in Kohutiak’s position,
posed poor spikes and Belcher and
Gillespie did not play up to form.
It was not an indication of their
potential. The

Team Spikes Opponents

adjust to new roles and a new
offense under such short notice.

It might also be noted that last
night’s confidence-shattering per-
formance may have brought the
squad back to reality. Maybe they
thought they were above them-
selves; that nobody could stand in
their way. -»

“Not so,” Collier said, adding.

A “The games we recently won we

were not supposed to (win).
Nothing could have been accomp-
lished had it not been for our
confidence.

“No, without confidence we are
not a highly skilled team. We have
to regain it and, in reality, have to
just about go back to square one.”

It may not be such a task to scale
the team’s mountainous adversity.
Currently, they have amassed a 16-
1 record and possess a 16-match
win streak.

The latter mark is the longest
consecutive win record ever
accorded to a women’s athletic
team in Pitt's history.

It will take more than a strong
backing like this, though, for the
Lady Panthers to sustain their hot
roll. It will take a strong and united
effort. ‘

of the most successful in the

of a new era in Pitt's running pro-

A Green Traveler Challenges Plane, Illinois

By BARRY ZASLOFF

The trip to Champaign last
weekend to cover the Pitt-Illinois
game was my first experience with
a plane. Not being a vacation-goer,
I naturally had many fears,
thoughts and questions along the
way.

On the flight to Champaign...

0 What would be my chances of
survival if the plane went down?

0 How could everyone be so
calm 31,000 feet high in the air?

0 I’ll never again complain
about car seats being too low to the
ground.

0 Dear little Mustang, where
have you gone?

0 And Suzanne, where did you
disappear to?

0 Why would anyon_e in her
right mind want to be a stewardess?
Next to owning a job in the funeral
parlor, it has to be the worst possi-
ble way to earn a living.

A Pitt Fan

By MAX REGULA

Anyone who watched Penn State
with a closed heart last Saturday
should be hung from the highest
‘-goal post, preferably one in State
College, Pennsylvania. Even the
most gung-ho of die-hard Pitt fans
must admit that the Nittany Lions
put on a show that would have
toppled P.T. Barnum himself.

0 Fasten your seat belts? What
good would they do if the plane
took a dive?

0 Why was the airline staff try-
ing to make worse an already lousy
meal by saying: “We are now...a-
bove ground?”

0 People actually pay to ride in
such discomfort?

0 What if it would start thunder-
ing? Better not think about that——
things are bad enough.

0 Do they have Pepsi in Illinois?
For that matter, do they have any-
thing in Illinois? Does life really
exist outside of Pittsburgh?

On the bus trip around the Ili-
nois campus...

0 What happened to all of the
hills? They must get good gas
mileage around here.

0 Do they have a place here equi-
valent to the “O”? Maybe not, no
place can match the Original.

0 The Cathedral of Learning
stands taller than all of these build-

Cheering

Their 27-24 last-second victory
over N o. 2 Nebraska has since been
characterized as being one of the
Lions’ greatest victories in Beaver
Stadium, but that might be an
understatement. If my heart had a
vote, the game should be celebrated
as one of college football’s most
outstanding contests ever.

Kirk Bowman’s winning catch
with four seconds showing on the
clock brought more Eastern foot-

ings stacked on top of each other.
The tallest is no higher than Forbes
Quadrangle. Wesley Posvar’s estate
makes these buildings look like
shrunken midgets.

0 Oops, the domed arena is
impressive. In fact, it makes the
Civic Arena look unimpressive. A
good indication of what Big Ten
basketball is all about.

0 Sure nice being on ground
level again.

0 They actually have a Wendy's

0 The sights are better in Pitts-
burgh, particularly those on the
Pitt campus.

0 Illinois women are obsessed
with wearing layers of clothing.
Despite 60-degree temperatures,
one girl looked as if she was prepar-
ing for a trip to Antartica.

0 There are enough corn stalks
around here to feed the entire
world.

During the game...

0 The Panthers will not play a
game at Pitt Stadium this year.
. 0 It's nice to be able to watch a
game without having to buy a
ticket.

0 Will I have time to write these
stories?

0 Hurry up halftime—I’m
starving.

0 Dave Puzzouli resembled a ’67
Chevy running on empty, on his
95-yard interception return.

0 The flight home will be made
in the dark. How much worse can it
get? I’m afraid I’ll soon find out.

0 Good ole Pittsburgh.

On the flight home...

0 Here we go again. Yeh, I
know—-we're 31,000 feet high.
Lousy food.

0 If there is such a thing as a sure
bet, it’s that I’ll never have ambi-
tions of becoming a pilot. Not even

a contract as lucrative as Jackie
Sherril's could bring the odds
down.

0 Do birds fly this high? If so,
I’m sure glad I wasn’t born a bird.

0 This experience might make a
helluva column. Would it be possi-
ble to work into the sport pages?
Perhaps if I mixed in some sports I
could pull it off.

0 Pitt’s offense needs the upcom-
ing game with Temple to regain its
confidence. If they can only survive
the West Virginia game next week.

0 Fazio used Marino as the pun-
ter again today. Thoughts of the
Penn State game last year. Dave
Hepler being crushed by a flock of

Joe Paterno for calling, but this
time I figured it was Penn State’s
turn to take a stand. Nebraska
quarterback Turner Gill thought
otherwise and snuck across the
goal-line for a touchdown.

“Weakl” I yelled. “Take that
cheap stuff back to thelcorn field." I
was furious. The Pros are allowed
to quarterback sneak, but in col-
lege you’re suppose to go over the
top. My heart felt as if it had
stopped; it seemed even colder than
my now-cold hamburgers. A

Twelve seconds and one kickoff
later my heart had started again. A
15-yard personal foul penalty
accessed against Nebraska put the
ball on the PSU 35-yard line.

A fourth-and-1 I first down com-
pletion from Todd Blackledge to
Kenney Jackson added hope.
Another Blackledge toss moved the
ball to the Nebraska two-yard line,
and if Beaver Stadium had a roof it
would have lifted away—not so
much because of the noise, but
because of the butterflies.

Every fan in the stadium had
them, and I had them in my apart-
ment. They were contagious. Even
the die-hard Pitt faris had them.

Joe Paterno struck quickly. Blac-
kledge faked left, retreated two

steps, and floated the ball into thg. 

endzone. It wasn’t pretty, but a slid-
ing Bowman caught the ball a
good inch above the slippery turf.
The official’s hands went up,
Beaver Stadium went up, Paterno
went up, and I went up.
Touchdown!

Why write about Penn State in a
Pitt newspaper? Because eventu-
ally the Panthers have to play
them, and eventually I have to root
against them. Two tasks which
might prove more difficult than
when David slew Goliath 2,000
years ago.

Defense

By DALE MOORE

West Virginia University seems
to be on the verge of becoming a
football powerhouse. After years in
mothballs, Coach Don Nehlen has

. , guided the Mountaineers into the

7)-

‘; Top 20 for the second consecutive

season. So far this season they are
undefeated, but that may soon
change. For Pitt’s sake, it had better
change soon.

Viewpoint

   

This weekend the Mountaineers
will find out just how far away
from, or how close to, they areto
the major football powers.
Although the Panther offense is
still in semi-hibernation, their
defense has been awesome and they
have sent three opponents home
battered.

Two of those three have been

Llteams ranked in the Top 20. Will

it

‘West Virginia be the next victim or
will the lack of offense finally catch
up to the Panthers? Well, don’t tell
the Mountaineers this, but they're
coming a long way for nothing.

West Virginia has gained
national aclaim and ranking this
season because of a 41-27 defeat of
perennial powerhouse Oklahoma.
But how tough are the Sooners this
season? just last week they lost
again, this time being shutout I2-0
by USC, already been defeated once
this season.

The Pitt soccer team is full of
fresh and new talent, like Virginia
native Mike Russell.

Russell, one of four freshmen
players from the Arlington area, is
playing a key role for the Panther
squad.

At the age of seven, Russell, an
army brat, found an interest in
soccer while living in Australia.

“Soccer is the national sport
down there and I picked up on it,”
Russell said. “The coaching was
great because they had experienced
people teaching you the skills of
the game.”

In 1976 when Russell returned to
the States, he joined the Arlington
club team, Under Coach John Ver-
Standig, Russell refined his skills
and traveled throughout the coun-
try and abroad.

“VerStandig has had the biggest
influence on me dealing with
soccer,” Russell said. “He created a
lot of opportunities for me and the
team.”

Now Russell has earned himself
a ' starting position with the Pitt
booters. At 5-8,1/2, he has become a
fixture in the Panther defense. As a
freshman, Russell plays sweeper,

an important position according to

head coach Leo Bemis. '

“Russell has good skills and
tackes well,” Bemis said. “He’s
tough to get around on the field.”

“As sweeper, I’m the last man in
the defense besides the goalie,”
explained Russell. “I don’t have
one particular guy to cover. I’m the
extra man. I try to bring the ball
back up the field and direct the
play.”

Russell has also distinguished
himself as a leader out on the field,
something that goes along with his
sweeper position and something
that comes from confidence.

“The upperclassmen took me as
a player, notjust a freshman,” Rus-
sell said. “As sweeper, I can see the
whole play and I try to direct the
play. I felt comfortable with my
duties and I got along with the
players well. No one else seemed to
be taking the leadership out on the
field."

Bemis knows Ru_ssell’s talent,
and he has confidence in his skills.

“He is delivering so far,” Bemis
said. “He reads the game really
well, that’s why he’s playing an
important position on the team.”

Russell has been bestowed many
honors in his soccer career. He ws a

....

Dark ominous clouds hung
thick over the Pittsburgh skyline
last Sunday morning. A brisk
wind, too cool for early autumn,
swept across the air. "~

For many, though, it was a per-
tect day. 1 hat Is, it you were one or
the few who prefer agony and
sweating over sun worshiping.
Yes, the gloomy weather brought a
multitude of smiles from over
l?,000 participants of the “5th
annual Great Race.”

From varsity athletes to weekend
warriors, the University of Pitts-
burgh was well represented at this
grand event. V

“It was a perfect day for a race,”
said Steve Smith, a junior business
psychology major at Pitt. “But
there were so many people that it
seemed more like an event rather
than a race.” ‘

It’s hard to distinguish a race
from an event, however. It was
apparent that the roads were
jammed with running enthusiasts.
According to Jenny Miller, who
works for the Pittsburgh Parks
Special Events office, this year pro-
duced the most entries ever.

Student Barb Michler agrees,
saying, “It was too crowded at the
beginning. It took me three min-
utes to get to the starting line after
the race began. It was like a humaifr
traffic jam; I was dodging people
left and right like a serpentine.”

The lax mood made the “Great
Race” 21 fun event. But some
Panther sport teams considered the
race serious training.

Carol Dugan, assistant coach for
the Lady Panther Basketball team,
said that the entire team (including
two coaches) ran to “stay in shape
for the season.” The Lady Panth-
ers, who finished in the 50 minute
time range, all said that “it is worth
it at the end.”

Another group of Panther ath-
letes who reached the finish line
did not appear like runners. They;
were built small and stocky am’;
sharply contrasted the thousands
of tall, lanky individuals. But the
Panther wrestling team was not
out to shatter any 10 km records;
they participated for pre-season
conditioning purposes.

“Running is a basis for the rest of
conditioning required for wrest-
ing,” explained Jeff Jelic.

When wrestler Dan Leche was
asked what time he was shooting
for in the 6.2 mile course, he hum-
orously answered, “I’m just shoot-
ing for the finish line!”

Wrestler Tim Dinger, an avid
runner who finished the race with a
very respectful time of 38 minutes,
said——stealing a phrase from a pop-
ular song—.-“I run because it hurts
so good.”

Senior, Dan Doyle said that he
ran in the race to “challenge Pitts-I
burgh hills.” After he was told that
the course was relatively flat he
immediately replied, “Well, Idid it
for the ‘hell of it.” I

Patti Gaffigan, Resident Student
Association vice president, said
that she dedicates a part of each day
to running. _

“It is a great feeling of satisfac-
tion when you’re through,” Gaffi-
gan said. “Running also helps me
keep my mind clear and run off any
excess aggression."

Panting to catch her breath,
Sally Nava modestly admitted, “I I
did a hell of a job." Nava, who is a
resident assistant in Bruce Hall,
explained, “Running this race was
easy compared to my R.A.
position.”

Although no Pitt Students came
home with the winning trophy.
Panther pride was running at full
throttle at the “(Lreat Race."

One of the major reasons for the
Pitt volleyball team's excellent per-

~. ﬁormance thus far this year has
‘'*&been the play of sophomore Judy
Young.

In Pitt’s big win over Rutgers
last weekend, Young spiked 33
balls in the two matches and scored
on 26 of them for a phenomenal
70% put away rate.

This is a percentage far exceed-
ing that of most All-Americas. Her
feat last weekend is comparable to a
basketball player's scoring 60
points in a game.

Young graduated in 1981 from
Conneaut Lake High School and
during her senior year led a team
with only one other skilled player
to the state playoffs.

 I After graduating, Young decided

M to attend Pitt, partially because of
the volleyball team and the people
she knew on the team,’ and more
importantly, because of the fine
medical program offered.

She started her freshman year,
and was a factor in Pitt’s attaining
the East Regional Championship.
Also, during Nationals, in which
Pitt placed ninth, Young played
well.

Over the summer. she played on
the Ohio Valley All-Star team that

participated in three tournaments.
In the Tennessee junior Zornal
Tournament, the team finished
first, as Young was voted to the
All-T_ournament first team.

iN—ext, the squad played in the
Chicago National AAU Junior
Olympic Tournaments, and she
was again} named all-tournament
first team. Finally, the team ven-
tured to Santa Barbara, where
Young led the team to a third place
finish behind highly regarded
UCLA and Santa Barbara.

Despite all of her achievements
last year, Young faced some prob-
lems with confidence early this
year. As a result of this, she was
only a part-time starter..

According to coach Sheldon Col-
lier, “Judy wasn’t playing nearly as
well as she or I wanted.” Recently,
though, Collier has been quite

 During Volleyball Season

pleased with her play, yet he still
isn’t totally satisfied, as confirmed
by his comment, “She has a long
way to go.”

Her major is pharmacy, which
for some is a very demanding field.
The- activities involved doesn’t
seem to bother her too much,
though. She says that it's just a
matter of budgeting her time
properly.

Of her academic like, Collier
says, “I consider Judy to be an
excellent student-athlete.” The fig-
ures bear Collier out as Young
presently boasts a 3.53 QPA.

Young said that if the team con-
tinues to work as hard as they are
presently working, they can go far.

Finally, she said, “There is no
place else I’d rather be.” It’s a state-
ment that should comfort all of
Pitt's volleyball fans.

Pitt A Challenge

For Mountaineers

continued from pageseventeen

This is not the first season in
which Oklahoma’s squad has
stumbled. Last season they also
failed to win their conference and
there is speculation that the Soon-
ers may be looking for a new coach
if they don’t find the old magic.

West Virginia’s next victory was
a 19-18 squeaker over Maryland.
The Mountaineers stopped a two-
point conversion try late in the
game to escape the upset. Maryland

is no slouch, but it's not a Top 10 7

team either.
This past weekend West Virgi-
rfia aiiriihilated the University of

- Richmond Spiders. Spiders? The

name tells the story.

The Mountaineer quarterback,

Jeff Hostetler, is what keeps the

fans happy. This Penn State

‘ transfer has given the people of
West Virginia some crazy idea that
the Mountaineers can beat Pitt and
Penn State.

Insanity, you may say. Hostetler
has been making the opposing
defenses insane. He is ranked as
one of the top signal callers in the
country, but so was Tony Eason of
Illinois; Eason was sacked nine
times.

lWest Virginiais a lot likehaving
a little brother who is growing up.
Nowihe is at the age where the
game is interesting, but he can’t go
all four quarters with you yet. So
big brother wins-today, but watch
out when little brother grows up.

continued from pagesevenleen
under Virginia State team. Last
year, he was invited to the under
19-year-old Eastern Regional
Soccer (lamp and was picked as an
alternate forgthe junior National
Soccer Team camp held in Texas.
The Jr. National Team is just a
step away from the Olympic team.

Russell had the opportunity to
attend several Virginia schools, but
he decided to make the trip to Pitts-
burgh and join a young and build-
ing team. ,

“I knew that whatever college I

went to, I was going to play
soccer," he explained. “I came to
Pitt with the impression it was a
growing program. Since it is a
growiingprogram, I wanted to get
at the base of it. Pitt’s program is '
on the uprise.”
S" Pitt soccer is on the uprise, even
though the Panthers are off to a
slow 3-4 start. They are improving
with each game.

AAAAKAAAAAA

;AAAAA..AAAA

Team

The Panther defense has been
playing tough anti steady, Rus-
sell's play being one of the reasons.
Pitt needs a scoring attack, and
slowly, the scoring spark is being
ignited.

In Pitt’s 3-0 win over Gannon,
Russell contributed to the punch,
scoring his first goal as a Panther
on a penalty kick. , ,

Russell is optimistic about tliim
remainder of the Pitt soccer season.

“We should do very well this sea-
son,” he said. “We're in good shape
and from what I heard, we're a bet-
ter team than last year.

“I think we need stronger mid-
field play and we need to finish
(score) when we have the oppor-
tunity, which only comes with
playing,” Russell added. “All a-

, long,we’ll be building our confi-

dence, so we can do what we want.”
And all along, Russell will be

gaining experience and sharing the

confidence he already has.

Chancellor shaping up
for collegiate athletics...

Earlier this year, Pitt Chancellor
Wesley W. Posvar was named to sit
on a National Collegiate Athletic
Association (NCAA) committee to
fﬁgudy the problems plaguing inter-
collegiate sports.

Posvar was one of 20 major uni-
versity presidents who met in
Washington D.C. this past Sunday
as members of the American Coun-
cil on Education Ad Hoc Commit-
tee on the Problems of Major
Intercollegiate Athletic Programs.

Also, Posvar was named to a
NCAA panel which will meet this
Sunday and Monday in Denver to
discuss problems in education
involving athletes.

Both of these committees should
come up with recommendations to
the NCAA which will be decided
on during future NCAA conven-
tions. Some of the topics that will

A be discussed are admission stand-
ards, eligibility requirements,
abuses in recruiting and rules and
reforms in the structure of the
NCAA.

Posvar is one of 16 people named
to this committee. Among the
members are seven presidents, two

F

faculty representatives, two
athletic directors, two coaches and
three at-large members.

Pitt- WVU game moved...

After all the rumors surrounding
moving the Pitt-West Virginia
game to Sunday in order to appear
on national television, ABC
announced the Oct. 2 game will be
moved back to 12:35 p.m. instead of
the original 1:30 start. The game
will be a regional broadcast carried
throughout the East and Midwest.
Keith Jackson will be the play-by-
play commentator. Both teams will
receive $300,000 for their
appearance.

B lackledge on Cover...

Most Pitt-haters have seen

‘ enough of Dan Marino on the cov-

ers of every football magazine
imaginable. Now, it’s Penn State's
quarterback Todd Blackledge’s
turn.

Thanks to his performance on
Saturday, which included throuw-
ing the game-winning touchdown
with four seconds left, the 6-4, 222
lb. junior will appear on the cover
of Sports Illustrated which has the
game story of the Penn State-
Nebraska game.

So far, Blackledge’s statistics are

better than Marino's._ who has been
considered a candidate for the

New.York’s Longest Running Musical Hit.
