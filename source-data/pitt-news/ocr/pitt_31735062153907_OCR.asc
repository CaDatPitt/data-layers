~LUBIC H.ON'ORED

The Varsity Letter Club of the Uni-
versity held their annual Smoker at
Trees gymnasium last Wednesday
night and over 250 past and present
‘letter men attended the affair. _ThisJ
is by far the most successful'g~a'ther—
ing of this kind ‘held in the history of
the institution and the otﬁc-ers and

-meet with Syracuse University .

_ ,__,;__at“,Morgant«own onglune 2. State

'80‘games played. .This is a remark-

 
 
 

those connected with the affair are to
be congratulated. _ A

R. W. VVa'llace who waspresident
of the organization -for the past term
was succeeded by Dr. A. B. Wallgr-en,
a ‘former famous athlete at the Uni-
versity and at present connected with
the'University as a member of the
faculty.  ‘C; Marshall was "elected
vice-president .and Robert Grove was
reelected secretary-treasu-rer. 7 ,

‘At the meeting the election of
Frank B. McNulty to the captaincy’
of the basket ball ﬁve for next winter
was announced. M»cNulty is one of
the best known athletes in the Uni-
versity to-day and has won letters in
three branches of -sports. He prepped
at Carnegie High school and at Mer-
cersburg prep.‘ He iso-ne -of the best-
ﬂoor men that has ever carried the
Blue and Gold colors. The’ ann unce-
ment of his election was received with
much pleasure by the men and Mc-
Nultyﬁwas widely congratulated.

_That, too, is as it should -be!-

Some record that the Panther ﬂoor
teams have acquired while Lubic was
in school. Eighty starts and sixty-

Of course, Benny did‘ not win all
of them, but he had a .lot to do with
most of them- In fact-no le.ss thafl‘
1-6 of them are in the Pitt -win column
directly due to "Lubic’s ability to

McNulty is oneof the most popu-
lar athletes off the ﬁel_dj as "well as
on-e of the greatest on.‘ Few realize
just what this lanky athlete‘ has done
since he entered'Pitt. ~ He has won’
letters in three branches of sports-
-baseball, basket ball and ‘football. And

this is his Secondﬁvinteflfl the Unki Scotland had to be given the honor

‘vie-rsity. '

If he de‘cides to go out for thetrack
team hewill stand _a good chance of
equalling the record made by De-
Har~t,..who was -the ﬁrstman in the
history of the institution to‘w7in let-
ters- in four branches. "And F.rank
could do it, too. He is some fast man
on the tra-ck.

The election of Dr. Wallgren to the
presidency of the ’Varsity Letter
Club was a popular" move, not only
with the grads" but with all those in
school at the present time that know
him. - Doc -is one of the. best -liked

,men‘in the faculty and there are

many who remember him as one of
the best athletes that ever represent-
ed Pitt. No small part of_ the credit
for the reputationithat Pitt‘has in
athletics is due to Wallgren’s efforts
when he was connected with the ad-
ministrating of them.

BeH.art was given_a mighty ovation‘

.when.he.was called upon to give a
- "talk. The Old Gra-ds_were glad to

see the ﬁrst. man in the ‘history o-f

the institution-‘who was able toiwin

PITTSBURGH » A '

FOOTBALL, WINTER
STOVE LEAGUE’ ‘L

The discussion‘ around the table had
reached the point where an “overt
act” was expected" at any moment.
Max hovered aroundithe booth anx-
ious as an old hen whose brood of
ducklings had taken to the w'atel‘..The
Dove of'Peace .as about as popular
as Unser Bill would be. at Sunday

But while most -of the group were at-
guing on the question of whether this
side or that was right, from the other-
end of the table“there rose an‘ up-
roar that silenced the former tem-
pest as up—to-date guns would .silence
most of the artillery that Uncle Sam
‘boasts. After the Reserves had ﬁn-
ally separated them explanations were

demanded and from out of the jumbled
and excited phrases that were offered
at the same time by the two combat-
ants it was found that the two nuts
were not ﬁghting about whether we
should arm the ships or not, or whether
the Kaiser or Lloyd George ‘was
right, but as to which foreign country
has sent Pitt the greatest ‘athletes.
It seemed that one of them held that

because John Bain Sutherland, our
bonny, lanky athlete,‘ ﬁrst started on
his career of shot putting bythrowing
his receptacle that -contained lacteal
fluid'"a=t the nurse who was some
twenty feet away. The best p.art of‘
it was ‘that it hit the nurse.

ll/Vell this started it. One held out
for this country and another" for an-
other., Some gave mighty good ex-'
amples of men that have starred for

ﬂags. Finally the Old Grad who had
not entered into the discussion said
that he noticed that no one *had‘men-
tioned that one o-f the best known ath-
letes that ever competed for Pitt had
been born in Ireland. “Many were the
guesses as to who it was but none hit
the right one. The closest any came
was one who suggested that it-might’
have been Steve Dillon. However,
this was “denied by the Old Grad.
“No, you are all wrong,”_ said the
Old Grad, ' “it ~was 'none other than

of the ﬁrst football eleven that ever
emerged triumphant over Penn State.”
Urged to‘continu~e‘, he gave the fol-_
lowing history.‘ of the lifeof this fa-
mous Blueand Gold athlete who has
won fame in-the‘-politiical world as:

Thompson 'is- a‘ self-"made man.’ He
was born in Killseel, County Down,
Ireland, Sep'tenlber"_26, 1871.‘ Here he
lived and -attended the so-called school.
until he was 18 years of age. He came
to Pittsburgh April 4, .1889. Then

was struggling to make good in this
new country. ‘A course-in .a «business
college only opened hisheyes to the
value of a college education and ﬁn-
ally when he was well" past the age
when most fellows are outin the world
with several letters after their _name,
he entered Geneva College at Beavel‘
Falls, Pa. There he competed in ath-
letics inseveral branches. In 1904 he
entered Pitt and captained the ‘team
that downed State to--the tune of 22'
t-o 5. The ﬁrst time, if ‘I remember
rightly, that the Blue and Gold had
ver downed the Blue alld White.

Then followed a very-busy and in-
teresting period in the life of this man.
He received his AB at Pitt in 1905, and
his LLB" in 1907. He was admitted
to practice of law in Beaver County,
January 17, 1908. 1910 and 1911 found
him chairman of the Beaver County
Republican Committee. ‘TheIf-ollow'-
ing year he was elected ‘to the State
Senate._ He entered t-he National
Guard of the state February 16, 1905
and by rapid promotion became major
in this organization-—a positionnnthat
he now holds in the Tenth Infantry.

_Thompson is one of -the most in-
teresting men that' we have ever had
connected with. our athletics-and still

a remarkable record he has made ‘de-
spite fall the handicaps that he labored
under. He certainly, is to be con-
gratulated for his success. 7' _ »

The .heated' discussion that had

party broke up. sManyj of-the group
=had heard facts that they never -knew_
before, and many preciated a cer-
tain former Pitt h:iTfback more than
they ever ‘had before._
