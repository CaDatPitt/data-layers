proposed the revision of the bylaws and
constitution during the meeting but tabled

all discussion on the matter until the next

meeting. -

. “Any member of the council can make
proposals. I proposed the changes in the
bylaws as _a report. There will be a meet-
ing Oct. 26 at 8:30 p.m. in the IFC office to
discuss the proposed changes,” Rea said.
“Hopefully, we’ll be able to deal with
questions fairly and with more depth of
discussion.” ‘

Rea refused to allow External Vice

President Christopher Block to comment

— on the proposal at the meeting.

 Rea has apparently taken the posi-
tion that this ishis IFC. By censoring the
members of the. executive board ‘of the

IFC, he has effectively over-stepped the

bounds of his position,” Block said.

Rea said the mainreason for tabling all
discussion on the proposal was because of
the Monday night meeting and the length
of the proposal.

“There is going to be the meeting on
Monday for discussion. Any proposed
change tothe constitution must be tabled
for atleast one' meeting, where there is

then formal discussion on the proposal,”
Rea said.

“The proposed change is 14 pages long.
It would have been difficult for everyone
to examine the document and realize all
of the structural changes that are in it,”
Rea said. ’

Both Block and IFC Secretary Joe
‘Bowman were upset that there was no

discussion on the proposal allowed at the
IFC meeting.

Bowman said that there should have
been discussion on the matter at the rneet—
ing since many people will not be able to

Block said that the proposed new
bylaws were created by Rea on his own
and without the support of the rest of the
executive board.

Rea said that he did write the proposal
on his own.

“Yes, I did [write the proposal on my
own], but the other executive board mem-
bers had every opportunity to become
involved in the proposed changes,” Rea
said. “More specifically, with the end of

Anew lung center
opens at Montefiore

By Pete Kapustynski _.
Asst. News Editor

Pitt has opened the Comprehensive Lung Center at
Montefiore Hospital that uses state of the art procedures
and technology to research and combat lung diseases.

“The incidence of many common lung diseases, partic-
ularly asthma, lung cancer and chronic obstructive pul-
monary disease (COPD), such as bronchitis and emphy-
sema, continues to rise. According to the Centers for
Disease Control, COPD is\the fifth leading cause of death

of cancer deaths in both men and women,” said Robert
M. Rodgers CLC" director. S

The center is designed to directly apply new research
to victims of lung diseases.

“There are two aspects to [the CLC]. One is to actually
bring this state-of—the—art medicine to patients and make
it very accessible to them. The other thing is to make

able,” said Robert M. Hoffman, CLC director’ of Outpatient
Services. —

Current CLC programs include work with:

0 Sleep apnea, also called sleep-disordered breathing.
This is a period during sleep when a person may stop
breathing. The brain slightly awakens the body to take a
breath. These periods of wakefulness are so brief they
are usually not recalled. The result is a constant sleepi-
ness with no apparent cause to the sufferer.

Sleep apnea can be caused by a number of things
including an obstruction of the airway or a problem with
the brain’s regulation of the breathing reflex. To people
with a severe case of sleep apnea, sleep will occur at an
inappropriate time. For example, in class or while dri-
ving. . A
“Sleep apnea is estimated to effect one in 20 adult
males, and I suspect it may be even more,” Hoffman said.

Some treatments for sleep apnea include wearing a

Adventurous living
is the main goal
of Outdoors Club

By David Weimer
For The Pitt News

Students interested in backpacking, exploring caves,
mountain climbing, white-water rafting, canoeing, skiing,
horseback riding or skydiving should check out Pitt’s
Outdoors Club.

“We want to introduce people to different outdoor activi-
ties,” said Tamara Habrat, president of the Outdoors Club.

Senior Brian Hannen said that he attended his first meet-
ing after hearing about a skydiving trip sponsored by the
club. He jumped three times during his first year at Pitt and
later became interested in another activity.

“I kind of got addicted to rock climbing,” Hannen said.

Since then, Hannen has learned to lead—climb, and he led
a mountain climbing trip to Seneca Rocks, West Va.

“When you lead—climb you take the rope up with you, it’s
not tied at the top,” Hannen said. “You’re hundreds of feet
up in the air and you’re looking around at the surrounding
valley. It’s exhilarating.”

Habrat said that anyone can enjoy the Outdoors Club,
whether they grew up in a city, the suburbs or the country.
“We try to work it so that no one’s left out,” she said.

Betsy Cacchione, an anthropology major, said she enjoys
backpacking and joined the club to try something different.

“For me, the best thing is that if somebody wants to do
something they bring it up [at a meeting] and everybody
does what they can to make it happen,” she said.

Cacchione said she plans to hike the Appalachian Trail

into New York next year with her boyfriend, who is also in
the club.
A popular tradition among its members is an annual New
Year’s trip to New York. Last year, they stayed in cabins at
Allegheny National Forest, and Hannen said that everyone
had a good time. The students skied and hiked and played
“mud football.”

Pitt ’s Health Education Office
encourages healthy lifestyles

By Apryl Flynn
For The Pitt News

Pitt’s Health Education Office provides
information encouraging healthy behavior
and offers many free programs and services
to help students cope with their problems.

Health Education Administrator Shirley
Haberman said that a class on stress man-
agement is one of the most popular pro-
grams. Its purpose, she said, is to help stu-
dents understand and cope with stress more
effectively. .

Students attend four sessions and learn
relaxation exercises, a biofeedback tech-
nique, the cognitive component of stress,
time management, study tips and lifestyle
habits.

The office also addresses prevention. of
substance abuse on campus. Personal edu-
cation, assistance and referral is designed to
help students develop alcohol and drug
awareness by identifying individuals with
problems early and helping them.
Participation in the program can be either
voluntary or a part of disciplinary action.
Participants must attend three education ses-
sions and one assessment interview.

There is also a Recovering Students sup-

port group. Haberman said it was created
by a Pitt student who was a recovering
alcoholic and felt there was a need for
an Alcoholics Anonymous group on cam-
pus. .
The office employs a full-time drug and
alcoholic prevention specialist who does
programs on campus by request and for ath-
letic teams, Greek organizations and resi-
dence life programs. '

The office also specializes in programs on

eating and weight. Students can take a
weight control workshop that focuses on
proper nutrition, behavior modiﬁcation and
exercise.

The other program is an ongoing support
group. “It’s a smaller group, but it’s real
important because a lot of students on cam-
pus do start feeling badly about themselves
and experience bodylimage disorders,”
Haberman said. O ,

“You don’t necessarily have to be a full-
blown anorexic or bulimic to be a member
of that group,” she said. “A lot of students
are in that gray area where they know that
they don’t feel good about themselves or
they’re so preoccupied about eating or their
weight that it really gets in the way of
enjoying life.”

‘The office employs a registered dietician
who hosts nutrition education programs
about proper diets, weight reduction and
eating disorders upon request and is also
available for one—on—one counseling.

Students concerned about their own
health and well—being can attend different
health check programs, blood pressure
checks, health promotion programs and the
annual health fair. Also, students can pick
up videotapes, brochures and articles on
several health—related topics at the Health
Education Office.

Students have the opportunity to become
a peer health educator since all support
groups are peer supported. Haberman said
that chosen students are trained and paid to
help promote ‘healthy lifestyles for program
participants. I

Also through the office, 1,000 students are
certified in CPR training per year by trained
student instructors. ’

Most attacks come from the
waist up, Smith said. It is
important to keep the upper
body protected while watching
for possible signs of attack.

“Be observant,” Smith
warned. “Don’t let yourself get
lulled into a low-risk scenario.”

Smith told students to put
themselves in a criminal mind
and pick out which ones
among the group they would
attack and why.

One of the basic points of
BYAM self defense is to keep a
safe distance from strangers.
Smith demonstrated this by
maintaining an arm’s-length
distance from a student
throughout one scenario.

“Don’t be stupid,” Smith said.
“If you feel that a person’s real-
ly pressing you, why should
you stay there to see what's
going to happen? Believe me, it
will happen.” I

The main stress of Smith’s
program is for students to keep
what he calls the reactionary
depth. This is an imaginary
boundary between the student
and a possible assailant, about
four to six feet tall, Smith said.

By using street simulations,
Smith said he hoped the stu-
dents would be able to use the

skills and knowledge to protect
them in real—life situations.

A majority of the students
attending the seminar were
female. This is common for a
self defense class, Smith said.

The pledge class from Delta
Zeta sorority came to the semi-
nar.

“Our pledge mom organized
this so we could be. safe on
campus,” pledge Jennifer Reilly
said. “She wants to make sure
we use safety precautions if
we’re ever put in a situation
that we couldn’t handle.”

Two safety volunteers from
Lothrop also attended.

The program was sponsored
by the Student Government
Board and the Department of
Public Safety. SGB member
Dan Leichter said that another
seminar will be scheduled
within the next few weeks.

If the new proposalis passed, it will
change the internal structure of the IFC.

. The changes to the bylaws include a list of

requirements for becoming anew member
of the IFC, the duties of IFC representatives
and a better definition of the powers and
duties of the officers of the IFC, Rea said.
“If you compare the current bylaws and

. constitution fairly, the proposed document

is clearer, more organized and the delega-
tion of authority and duties are more
defined,” Rea said.

Rea said that the changes were designed
to increase communication, coordination
and the overall operations of the IFC.

“Our IFC is good, but the proposed

‘change would-allow the council to operate

more smoothly,” Rea said.

participation in the.IFC. In this proposal, it
is cutting out a_ minimum of 16 committee
members.” A’

Block also said that a criticism of the pre-
sent bylaws -was that the people in charge
could not handle their responsibilities, and
in the proposal the executive board. mem-
bers are given even more responsibilities.

Rea said, “In many ways, we used the
present constitution and bylaws as a build-
ing stone to propose a revamped, more
organized council. At first, all chairmen and
committees would be eliminated, but the
new executive board will be able to estab-

lish.new standing comrnitteeswhen they

need them.” ‘
Block said that the changes are unneces-

sary -and that the current bylaws replicate

the North Eastern Inter—Fratemity Council’s A

bylaws.

“Our bylaws now are the way it has
worked for -years. We have an exemplary
IFC now and people from other schools
have come to our meetings to see how our
IFC works,” Block said.

Rea hopes that everyone will provide
their ideas at the meeting Monday night.

“I still want eve1yone’s input for this pro-
posed change. It’s my hope that everyone
in the council will add productive informa-
tion to the document so that everyone will
be properly represented,” Rea said.

world nation.”

Pitt history professor, Sam
Hays,,said he believes that the
Bush administration needs to
realize the economic importance
of a strong environmental policy.

“Environmental regulation fos-
ters economic growth,” Hays
said. “Having regulations in the
market means the developing
and manufacturing of new
equipment, and that creates
jobs.”

Hays reminded his audience
of the new slow—groWing envi-
ronmental market they are now
experiencing.

“There is a new economic
opportunity in the environmen-
tal market, and we need explicit
regulation by the federal govern-
ment,” Hays said.

Hays said that this kind of pol-
icy costs money to enact, but we
need to invest now to make
money later.

“Bush is an anti-environmental
president 99 percent of the
time,” Hays said.

Dr. Sally Newman, professor
of urban resources at Pitt, is con-
ﬁdent in the Clinton/Gore plan
for educational reforms.

The Life—Tirne Learning Plan, a
four—step plan for educational
reform, has received attention
because it aims at all types of
students across the country. The
first step is aimed at parents

dren to begin education in the

The second step calls for
kindergarten through senior high
school reform to reduce class
size, expand decision making to
the school faculty directly
instead of alschool board and
increasing standards for teachers.

The third and fourth steps are
geared toward older students,
involving a National Youth Care
program and a funding plan for
university students where they
provide a sen/ice for the com-
munity instead of paying back a
college loan. ,

“Our statistics are frightening,”
Newman said. “Ten to 15 per-
cent of Americansare illiterate,
and 25 percent of American stu-
dents drop out of high school.
We need a preventive. policy
that can deal with these figures.”

Newman said she wants to see
more money going into such
programs as Head Start and

programs will build an ethic of

education in depressed areas.

Pitt's halfway house

Pitt students are halfway through the semester. Mid-
terms are almost finished, most first-year students
have by now adjusted and eaten at the ‘O,’ and the
Pitt Football team is (thank God) halfway through.
But the one thing that wasn’t supposed to be
“halfway” finished at the time the semester began was
Sutherland Hall. Much to the chagrin of many stu-
dents however, their home remains, in theliteral
sense of the word, empty. ,

It is true that most of the basic necessities are pro-
vided for at Sutherland. Students have the same bath-
rooms, kitchens and lounges that other dorms pro-
vide. However, Sutherland. was to be “the place to
live” because of the many extras it was supposed to
have. .

Little did students realize that these extras included
loud construction workers banging their tools at 7
a.m. and countless maintenance problems. Couple

this with the fact that the cafeteria and computer lab

have yet to be opened. And many of the amenities
that students were supposed to enjoy, for example
computer main frame hook—ups in all rooms, have not

\ been completed either.

This is hardly fair to the students involved here. The
lottery for housing takes place in March. At this time,
most of the students who chose Sutherland were led
to believe that it would be completed. Guess what? It
hasn’t been. #-

Secondly, the fact that the computer lab has yet to be
finished also raises a question about safety concerns.
The inefficiency of the campus shuttles and the dis-
tance involved for these students to get to computer
labs late at night is a legitimate concern.

Despite all of the benefits that Sutherland Hall resi-
dents were supposed to enjoy, the bottom line is that
their home for the next year has yet to be completed.

All. of the advantages they expected and, most impor- .

tantly, are paying for are currently non-existent. As
major economic contributors to the university, the
administration should have taken into consideration
the circumstances involved here. - ’

Seeing how the university has an unlimited life
when it makes an investment, it eventually gets to
reap all of the benefits. The same thing cannot be
said of students. While some students may live in the
same dorm for four years, most students do not. ‘A

Therefore, it simply is not fair to make students pay
for things that they themselves are not enjoying. The
university should charge whatever they feel is neces-

sary once all the amenities are in place. But to cur-.

rently make students pay more is simply unfair. Until
the students of Sutherland Hall receive all of the
amenities they expect, a reimbursement should be
granted. 9 C

Clinton not a member of the KGB

So, have you heard the news?
Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton
is Karl Marx reincarnated. Now
I wonder if his sidekick Al
Gore is really Vladimir Lenin.
My question now is, if they are,
who cares? Obviously George
Bush does.- Despite the fact that
the Republican nominee
accepted Clinton’s explanation
that his visit to Moscow was a
tourist excursion unrelated to
his anti-war activities, Bush said
he would not end his attacks
concerning Clinton’s anti-war

' protests.

Bush has continued to relent-
lessly pound Clinton’s charac-
ter. The latest verbal bashing
by the president contained an
assertion that Clinton was hid-
ing details of a trip he took to
Moscow during the peak of the
Vietnam War. This was just the
latest in a series of attacks
against the governor that are
aimed at questioning both his
commitment to the country and
his character. Earlier the GOP

-tried to bring up information

about whether Clinton may or
may not have avoided military
service during the Vietnam
War. Now the GOP is wonder-
ing if he is a commie.

Bush can attack Clinton’s
patriotism all he wants. And he
has. But to the American voters
it really won’t matter. For one
thing, the Vietnam War
occurred more than two
decades ago and has no politi-
cal bearing on what happens
today. The fact that Bill Clinton,
along with many others,
protested against an unpopular
war has nothing to do with the
critical issues of this campaign.
Nor are they a reflection of his
patriotism. This is because the
Vietnam War was different
from the other wars we fought.

During World War II young
men lined up to fight for their
ideals and their country. Not in
Vietnam, however. The ques-
tion of whether we belonged
there or not will be debated for
centuries. Many Republican
supporters assert that the value
of patriotism and love for your
country are important in a pres-
idential nominee. Maybe so.
While these ideals still concern
the American public, they say

Rachelle

. 081111

nothing about Clinton's ability
to be president of the United
States. The average voter real-
izes this. Quite simply, we live
in a different world.

If these candidates were run-
ning for election in 1941, then
the issue of patriotism would

be paramount. But it is not cen-

tral in 1992.

During the 19605, the politi-
cal environment in the world
was very different from what it
is today. At that time commu-
nism was considered a threat to
democratic ideals. American
patriotism and democracy were
seen as the weapons against
this threat.

Leaders stressed that going
to war in Vietnam would pre-
vent communism from spread-
ing to first South Vietnam and
then the rest of the world. The
soldiers there were seen by
politicians as walls against
communism. Here in 1992,
though, America is not fighting
a wareand most of the walls of
communism have been broken
down.

The main issue of this 1992
campaign concerns not the
struggle against an ideology but

an economy that has severe
problems. According to a study
in Newsweek magazine, one
person in every four house-
holds has lost a job since 1990.
According to that same study,
only 38 percent of the respon-
dents said they are better off
today then they were four years
ago. The economic difficulties
of this country are things Bush
must answer to. 9

Instead of criticizing the
patriotism of Bill Clinton, he
should talk about a different
plan to help spur an economy
in decline. His policies failed.
In addition to discussing the
economy, the president must
start talking about his plans in
the war against AIDS, drugs,
crime, homelessness, etc. He
must also address the long term
problems that face the environ-
ment — especially the deple-
tion of the ozone layer.

These are the critical issues
that voters want to hear about.
They are the critical topics that
our country faces as we head
into the 21st century. Patriotism
is not a primary consideration
in the 1990s like it was in the
19605 — we are not at war.
Even if we were at war, issues
concerning domestic-policy
could not be pushed aside.

Whether Bill Clinton did or
did not avoid the draft is irrele-
vant. So is the question about

his possible communist ties.The

question about George Bush’s
commitment to America is the
real issue.

Maybe Clinton is a commie
sympathizer, maybe he isn’t.
Once again, who cares?

First-year phenoms lead Pitt soccer to top

     

Midﬁelder Jeff Porter no longer has to do it all as he did in high school, but he is a key part

Lone NFL prognosticator takes overfor Schoolboys

By Brian Gallagher

Sports Assistant

Pro picks before college
picks? You tell me.

Taking the baton from the
out—of—control duo known as
School Boys — a motley two
who ventured out of the soli-
tude of college football and
into the uncharted waters of
the NFL — it’s time to drop the
low-down on this weekend’s
pro football action.

After all, the games are only
96 hours away. ,

Pittsburgh (4-2) at Kansas
City (4-3) -8.5: The Steelers

recovered from their two-game
slide by bashing the Bungles

20-0 Monday Night, but they

are a ways from becoming an
elite team in the NFL. While
O’Donnell, Foster and compa-
ny finally scored inside the 20,
there is still reason to believe
this group will have difficulty
in that zone — particularly on
Sunday Night in Missouri.

The Chiefs are 4-3 but could
be 7-0 with some timely late
scoring against, the Oilers,
Broncos and’ Cowboys. - QB

Dave Krieg has been the key‘

for Marty Schottenhein1er’s
offense, keeping defenses off

 

guard with his sly play—action
passing. Watch for Krieg’s
slight of hand to confuse

- Pittsburgh’s overpursuing “D.”

exciting and very talented crop
of first-year players. A

And it is this group of play-
ers, as much as any other
group of older, ‘more experi-
enced’ men on this Panther
team, that has helped make Pitt
the Beast of the Big East this
season and the talk of college
soccer. T _

Not only have the Panthers
shot to the top of the Big East
with five conference victories
after they failed to win a single
Big East game all of last sea-
son. Not only have the
Panthers already won more
games this year (nine) than
they did all of last season (six)

THE prrr NEWS, Wednesday, October 21, 1992

  

Where has our Pitt pride
gone?

The truth is our Panther foot-
ball squad is not the double-
dip, chocolate chip ice cream
cone we all wanted to show off
and brag about, but regardless
of their record they are our
team.

Our dedicated and responsi-

'7)ble journalists love_ to sit in

their cheap, reclining office
chairs and criticize and doubt
our team. They say things like,
“There is no hope for the rest
of this season” and “‘Pitt may
not see a Bowl game for the
next 10 years.”

They write articles that
ridicule the coaches and ques-
tion the talent of the players. I
thought I heard the epitome of
their hypocrisy and arrogance
when I heard the hosts of the
WPTS sports call-in show mock
the fans that attend the games;
accusing us of being drunk and
uninterested.

Imagine that, making fun of
the fans that are there instead
of encouraging people who
were not there to come.
Thanks Silverman, Pugliese,
Walborn, Zamoff and Lakely
for recognizing us. I wonder, if
there was no free food in the
press box, would your fat asses
make it up the hill?

I would like to take this

opportunity to express my

views on the press’ irresponsi-
ble journalism and offer my
opinion as just a mere spectator
on the Panther season.

First of all, the press does
have the right to look objec-
tively at any team. It doesn’t
take much to realize that our
team is doing poorly, but one
would hope that as members of
the Pitt student body and “fans”
of Panther sports, these journal-
ists would use their privileges
to the radio and papers to rally
some hope and spirit in our
school.

The same radio show that
was mentioned above criticized
the lack of football tradition
here at Pitt. It is true we don’t
have what the Wolverines or
Longhornes have as far as tradi-
tion and spectator madness, but
I suggest that it is up‘ to us to
begin that tradition now.

Let’s stand behind the team’s
rough times. Let’s rally, cheer,
support and show the commu-
nity and the team that we will
believe no matter how bad
things get. Let us ignore the
poor example being set by our
media inﬂuence and help build
a football tradition now, when
they need us most.

Look, anybody can jump on
the band wagon of a good
team, but true fans’ and specta-
tors battle through these hard
times. Responsible journalists

would try to find bright spots
in a dim season so we could
have something to look for-
ward to. How hard is it to sit
down and write an article on
how our season is going bad?F
ind the redeeming qualities.

Everybody wants something
good. We all want a school
with tremendous pride and
great tradition, but it is those
who desire it that actually
make something happen.

So while The Pitt News and
WPTS continue to trash our
desires, I say we fight back and
stand by Pitt. So maybe, just
maybe, the future will hold a
true football tradition.

Hail to Pitt.

A  student media slammed for treatment of football team

Bonds deserves fan support

In the beginning games of
the National League
Championship Series, Barry
Bonds was booed when he
stepped up to the plate, and of
course he didn’t do so great.
What did you expect from a
person when he didn’t even
have the support of his home
town? Maybe the reason Barry’s
postseason play hasn’t been up
to par is because of the enor-
mous pressure’ put on him by
the media and fans. If I were
him, I wouldn’t want to stay in
a city where my talents weren’t
appreciated and my mistakes
were never forgotten.

We, as fans, can help to keep
Barry in Pittsburgh where he

belongs. In game five (of the
NLCS) against Atlanta, Barry
was greeted in his first at-bat
by a crowd that was behind
him, chanting his name. Barry
answered with a double off the
outfield wall. As he stopped at
second base we saw him say
“I’m back.” And he was.

Bonds went on in the series
to get many more hits. Also,
did we forget that Bonds has
been described as the best all-
around player in baseball
today? Once again this year he
was armember of the 30 (home
runs)/30 [stolen bases] club,
etc.? If that isn’t enough for the
fans in Pittsburgh, then we
don’t deserve Bonds.

Are the Pens a great team or

 ;. After the first six games, the
 Penguins have reeled off a 4-0-

2 record, smoking the opposi-
tion for 31 goals while giving

H up only 19. This start may not

seem surprising considering
that the Penguins have won
two Stanley Cups in a row. To
me, however, the -Pens’ start is
a shock.

best hockey of his career.‘ He
racked up 19 points in his first

healthy Lemieux looks as if
he’s ready to break Wayne

that the Penguins didn’t even

Marioimagic leads ealrly-season Penguin charge

year, Barrasso looks as if he

still thinks that it is the playoffs, 

stopping shot after shot for the
Penguins. Judging by his start,
it appears that Barrasso can be
a contender for the Vezina
Trophy (for the NHL’s top
goalie).

Next, there’s the unmatched
depth of the Penguin forwards:
Lemieux, Kevin Stevens,
Jaromir Jagr, Rick T occhet, Ron
Francis, Shawn McEachern and
Mullen, when he returns". An
opposing team may be able to
stop one of the forwards from
scoring but not all of them. In
last Saturday’s game against
Hartford, the Whalers’ held
Lemieux to only two points.
Stevens shredded Hartford for

four goals and one assist in a 7- V

3 Penguin drubbing of the
'\X/halers.
Finally, general manager

‘ Craig Patrick must be congratu-

lated once more. Despite losing
Phil Bourque, Gord Roberts
and so on, Patrick signed the
likes of Dave Tippett and Mike
Stapleton.

Both of them have made up
a lethal penalty killing unit ’
while Stapleton has displayed
surprising versatility by playing
the point on the power play in
addition to taking a regular
shift.

Patrick also stuck with Bryan
Fogarty, a recovering alcoholic
who was acquired last year
from Quebec. Fogarty gives the
Penguins a legitimate left point
man on their power play. .

-Cherish the memories of
Barry Bonds’ career as a
Pirate. It is over. The Scrooge
disciples in the Pirate front
office will never spend the
necessary cash to keep base-
ball’s best player in
Pittsburgh.

The worst part is that the
fans of Pittsburgh and Bonds

have finally adjusted to each
other. In game three of the
playoffs, Bonds stepped to
the plate struggling at one for‘
10 for the series and the
crowd exploded into a chant
of “Barry, Barry.”

Bonds can be moody and
arrogant at times, but the fans
have finally warmed to him.
If there was justice in this
world, he would spend his
entire career in one place and
be a legend. If you don’t
think Pittsburgh fans will
worship a baseball player,
just mention the name
Roberto Clemente in this
town.

seniors,” Logan said.

Logan has, ‘however, been
around already. As a graduate
from Tulsa University, Logan
has been an assistant coach for
years. His resumé includes
stays at Oklahoma State, Tulsa,
Colorado and Mississippi State.

When he arrived at East
Carolina in 1989, Logan was a
running backs coach. In 1990
and 1991, the Oklahoma native
served as both the offensive
coordinator and quarterback
coach for the Pirates.

Within those years, Logan
helped former East Carolina
quarterback Jeff Blake (now
with the New York Jets) to
become the Pirates" inspira-
tional leader and catalyst to
their terrific season last year.

This year, Logan is nurturing
another signal caller named
Michael Anderson. Anderson
haslalready thrown 15 touch-
downs and leads the top pass-

ing game in the nation.

“Michael is a bright, bright
young man,” Logan said. “As a
sophomore, he is well ahead
of the pace [Blake was at as a
sophomore].

“He has aigood arm and a
great gift of accuracy. He could

'make me a good coach and

I’m going to let him,” Logan
said.

But Logan, besides his prolif— .

ic offense making him look
good, has tried to use his spe-
cial teams to make him look
even better. His razzle—dazzle,
element of surprise, tricky play
special teams make opposing
coaches quiver.

“He’s [Logan] a free wheel-
er,” Pitt head coach Paul
Hackett said. “Do it [the trick
plays] any place and any time.”

That might worry Hackett.
His team needs the momen-
tum, that one of Logan’s mas-
ter-mind plays could take away

obscene salary structure of
baseball. Now I am really
depressed.

-Think about the fact that
there probably will not be
another riot in the Schenley
Quad after a Pirate postsea-
son victory since they proba-
bly will not get there with
Bonds and possibly Doug
Drabek gone next year. Just
think, all that great toilet
paper doomed to a less glori-
ous fate than to_._take ﬂight
from a rioter’s hand. I think I
may cry.

-At least baseball fans
know better than to think of
Bonds as a jerk. Atlanta

-Brave/Falcon Deion Sanders

has shown us all what a jerk
truly is after that shocking
seventh game.

Instead of celebrating the

victory with his teammates,
Sanders decided to douse
sportscaster Tim McCarver
with ice water four times

because he dared suggest that

the two—sport hype-master
actually try to honor the con-
tracts he signed with each

.team.

Of course Sanders would
never settle things with vio-
lence. He has no taste for hit-
ting anybody — just like on
the football field. It would be
a shame if the Braves finally
decide that he is more trouble
than he is worth; Sanders and
Ted Turner deserve each
other.

-To hell with baseball, let’s
go Pens. They Penguins can
ﬂy, and for once they are
doing it early in the season.
How nice of them to actually

bother to show up for the
regular season this year. Yet
again, this team is responding
to a challenge.

When they won their first
Stanley Cup, critics said they
didn’t play the toughest teams
in the playoffs. Their answer
was to knock off the two
teams with the best regular
season records in last year’s
run for title number two.
Critics said they can’t do it in
the regular season. Critics do
not seem tq know much.

Watching this team will
make anybody feel good.
Shame on you for a lifetime if
you miss out on watching the
most talented team in recent
memory. They are not as con-
sistently outstanding as the
Edmonton Oilers of the ‘80s,

‘ One man who can assess
better than any other just how
big of a part Pitt soccer’s

A “Fantastic First-year players”

have played in the team’s
incredible turnaround this sea-
son is Coach Joe Luxbacher.
Luxbacher, whose Panthers
entertain Canisius University
this evening at Pitt Stadium at
7:15, said the performance of
his team’s first-year players has
been a major part in helping
Pitt climb to its comfortable
position . atop the Big
East standings with a 5-1 con-
ference record and a 9-4 mark
overall. F
“The freshmen have come in
a good job,”
Luxbacher said. “All of them ...
and it’s not one [player] who
has stood out. They’re a good
group, and they can all keep

- improving. They’re very good

players.”
The first-year player who has
grabbed most of the headlines

thistseason is goalie Adam

Spitzer.

Since coming in off the
bench to start the second half
in Pitt’s second game this sea-
son — a 2-1 loss to Bucknell
University — the ﬁrst—year—play-
er from Morganville, N.J., has
been nothing short of sensa-
tional.

Spitzer has -posted a 9-2
record as the Panthers’ starting
netminder, recording seven
shutouts and posting a minis-
cule 0.50 goals against average.
Last month he was honored as
Big East Defensive Player of
the Week for the part he
played in garnering the
Panthers their first two Big East
wins in two years against
Providence and Boston"
College. Spitzer was a major
force in propelling Pitt to its
string of seven straight wins
earlier in the season.

“We’re very, pleased,’-’
Luxbacher said of the play of
his starting goaltender. “He’s
done the job. He has the
potential to be a -great goal-
keeper.”

Worst job in pro football?
Easy. Working for the Seattle

nothing going for it —- save for
the ‘fact that it will get back to
the playoffs much sooner than

but when they are on their
game the Penguins are
awesome.

Topping it all off is the
best player in the world —
Mario Lemieux. The mag-
nificent one seems to be
on a mission to dominate
like he never has before
this year. His new contract
will probably keep him in
Pittsburgh the rest of his
career. Appreciate it. I feel

better. ‘

°Maybe you should for-

. get about sports and study’

for a while. Maybe sit in-
on a class or two. This is
college you know.
-Enough temporary
insanity, let’s talk football.
Maybe we can figure out
why there seems to be a
law against football teams
in Pittsburgh scoring
touchdowns. The Steelers
and Panthers can both

 

move the ball up and
down the field, but they
don’t convert their oppor-
tunities. Maybe it is some-
thing in the water.

The answer for the
Steelers could be too big
to miss. Actually it is two
answers — tight ends Eric
Green and Adrian Cooper.
Both have shown they can
be effective close to the
end zone, but they have
not had the opportunities
so far. Besides, I miss
Green’s butt—wiggle dance.

-Ofcourse, you could
read The Pitt News.

-Physical abuse of any-
body doing the tomahawk
chop is always fun.

-Take a Braves hat, a
bowl of Jel1—O, a blender,
whipped cream and — oh,
never mind.

After that, I think I have
to take some of my own
advice and get a life.

in a heartbeat, to keep on its
winning ways.

Worrying about Logan’s “bag
of tricks” is almost senseless
for any opposing coach.

' Hackett is not worried. On the

contrary, he is happy to see
these kind of plays.

“I think it’s exciting,” Hackett
said. “A punt‘ fake on their
own 20 yard and four onside
kicks against Syracuse, it’s very
exciting.” «

East Carolina’s speed and
quickness is what Hackettsaid
enables the Pirates to pull
off Logan-planned master-
pieces. .

“It’s a great philosophy
[Logan’s risk takingl,” Hackett
said. “It_’s just great.”

The Panther head coach
might not be so ecstatic over
Logan’s “philosophy” if it
works on Pitt this Saturday.

The insanity of this special
team “philosophy” might drive
Hackett nuts, into a straight
jacket maybe.

Soccer

Continued from page 16
Mellon two weeks ago and,
with the exception of Prex,

sive weapon this year.

All this despite not starting
a single game all season.

But Coach Luxbacher said
he feels that a player does
not need to start to be effec-
tive.

“Starting isn’t that impor-
tant,” Luxbacher said. “It’s
how many minutes you play
 [Dean’s] been good com-
ing off the bench because
he gives us a different type

ward Scott Alexander] and
he are both big, strong guys,
but they’re different types of
players. So when Alex plays
a bit and then you substitute
Dean, all of a sudden it’s a
different type of player,
which causes problems for a
defense.”

Astorino said that coming
off the bench is not some-
thing he is upset with.

“I don’t mind it,” he said.
“I just try to contribute
where I can.”

It Certainly helps Astorino
to contribute when the three
other first-year players who
have been making waves in
the Big East soccer world
are players he has known
and played with since child-
hood.

Forward Todd Graf and
midfielders J.L. Gorsin and
Jeff Porter are all, like
Astorino, local products who
have played soccer on club
teams for years together,

’ despite not playing on the
same high school clubs.

“We’ve played together
since we were on select
teams — me, Jeff, J.L. and
Todd — so when we prac-
tice we always work togeth-
er,” Astorino said.

“It’s a team thing,” Gorsin
added. “All of us freshmen;
we’ve played together for a
long time. We know what

has been Pitt’s major offen- '

of player. [Pitt senior for-

each one of us does  It
helps out a lot.”

Gorsin, a Finleyville, Pa.,
product, has played in all 13
of the Panthers’ games this
year, starting nine of them.

Although he has scored
only one goal this year,
Gorsin has still played solid
soccer. He and Jeff Porter
have been two of the
Panthers’ steadiest and most
reliable midfielders.

Gorsin said he feels he
and his fellow first-year
players have been a major
force behind Pitt’s newfound
success. ‘

“We’re helping the ‘team
outva lot,” Gorsin said.
“Defensively and offensive-
ly, with Dean scoring and. a
lot of good defenders play-
ing strong.”

Jeff Porter certainly agrees
and is more than content
this season to step aside
from his role as a star play-
er, a title he held in high
school, and become a part

-of a team in which everyone

is contributing.

“In high school, I pretty
muclr had to do everything.
I’d dribble, I’d shoot  I’ve
only scored two goals this
year, and I don’t know how
many I scored last year. It’s
the whole team now, and
not any one person.”

And with these newcom-
ers playing so well in their

first seasons the future for» - 

Pitt soccer looks bright no
matter how far this year’s
team may go.

“They’ve all really added
something,” Luxbacher said.
“Dino has scored some big
goals, Todd Graf is coming
into his own now. Jeff
Porter has played some
good ball for us. J.L. Gorsin
has been steady all year.
Adam in the goal, of course,
has done a good job 
They’re’ all good players,
and I think they’re all gonna
be better players too.”

Their, defensive effort against
the Chiefs — the best team the
AFC has to Offer — should
quiet those who took excep-
tion to Jimmy JohnsOn’s
defenders at the start of the
season.

The Raiders have awoken
from the dead, winning three

Only with the unpredictable

the major Overhaul stage of
Super Bowl losers thanks to
the Hall of Fameexploits of
John Elway, the NFL’S best
twO—minute quarterback not
currently sidelined in San
Francisco. Other than “Elway’s
only way,” the Broncos are
anything but a playoff team.

The Chargers are a danger-
ous 2-4, if such a title exists.

.._,..-With  a v_a~stly.,;. underrated

defense and their formidable
running game, Bobby Ross’
crewcan beat anyone if things
fall the right way. The injury to
mega running back Rod
Bemstine (separated Shoulder)
is an example of things not
falling right. With this in mind,
logic says go with Denver.
