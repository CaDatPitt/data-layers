UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

I

By Teresa Candori
Staff Writer

Pitt's College Republicans pub-
licly voiced at last night's Student
Government Board meeting their
opposition to the inclusion of a
sexual orentation clause to the
university's Equal Opportunity
Statement.

”We believe the sole purpose
of the Gay and Lesbian Alliance
in attempting to add the words
‘sexual orientation’ to the Equal
Opportunity Statement is to pro-
mote homosexual activity and
behavior by creating the appear-
ance of discrimination when, in
fact, no discrimination exists,”
said Roan Confer, College
Republicans representative.‘

The College Republicans’ state-
ment was in response to the
SGB’s recent resolution to sup-
port GALA’s attempt to have sex-
ual orientation included in the

Time limit
set on U.S.
and Soviet
arms treaty

Associated Press Writer

MOSCOW — Monday the
United States and Soviet Union
gave their arms control negotia-
tors one month to complete the
key provisions of a new treaty to
sharply reduce their strategic
nuclear weapons.

The decision was taken as U.S.
Secretary of State George P.
Shultz wound up two days of
talks in Moscow. He said negoti-
ators in Geneva who have so far
failed to make significant
progress toward a 50 percent cut
in long-range nuclear weapons
were directed to report to him
and Soviet Foreign Minister Edu-
ard A. Shevardnadze in Washing-
ton March 22-23.

Shultz also told a news confer-
ence that the Soviets indicated
they would be more flexible in
handling emigration applications,
except for those from people who
have had access to state secrets.

According to Shultz, Shevard-
nadze confirmed ”categorically"
that only those with information
the government considers impor-
tant to national security would be
barred from emigrating.

Earlier today, as he opened
talks with Shultz, Mikhail Gor-
bachev pledged to achieve peace
in Afghanistan and to try to reach

nation.

Confer emphasized that the
College Republicans are ’’totally
opposed to discrimination against
homosexuals.”

A make-shift wooden shanty
with the words ”Feed The
Homeless” spray-painted on
the side now stands on the
east lawn of the Cathedral of
Learning. The shanty was built
by the New Student Network
for Creative Social Change
[NSN] in an effort to collect
food and clothing for the
homeless.

The NSN plans to keep the
shanty on the Cathedral lawn
until this Friday in order to
make the Oakland communi-
ty more aware of the plight of
the hungry and the homeless.
There will be NSN members
and volunteers present 24
hours a day to accept dona-
tions of food to be given to the
homeless.

According to Bill Page, a
group spokesperson, homeless
persons will be ”welcome to
come here [to the shanty] and
sleep.”

The NSN was created about
six weeks ago in order to en-
courage political awareness
among students and to address
”important international, na-
tional and local issues.

’’If you're out on the streets
at night, you see a lot of home-
less,” said Page. ”Something
must be done. [This shanty] is
a symbol of raising peoples’
consciences toward homeless-
ness. If a problem is being
recognized, something will be
done/'

quota systems for blacks or wom-
en because ”there are clear-cut
cases of discrimination” for those
groups.

Joel Rapoport of the Gay and
Lesbian Alliance responded to
Confer’s statement by reading a
letter from Charles Rinaldo, AIDS
researcher and principal investi-
gator with the Pitt Men's Study.

Based on interviews with more
than 2,500 gay and bisexual
men, the researchers concluded
that many homosexuals face em-
ployment discrimination, family
disruption and housing problems.

Rapoport also cited statistics is-
sued by the Kinsey Institute for
sexual research, which place the
percentage of homosexuals in the
general population between four
and 12 percent.

Interviewed after the meeting,
Rapoport said, ”The College

NSN erects shanty to
protest homelessness

Page further commented
that the state legislature needs
to set up a bridge program that
will relocate homeless persons
into shelters.

’’I think it is important that
students know what is going
on,” said Shirley Friend, a
spokesperson from the Rain-
bow Kitchen Community
Center based in Homestead.

Friend said that items col-
lected at the shanty will be
shipped, to the Rainbow Kitch-
en, where they will set up a
pantry for those in need to
come pick up food and cloth-
ing. She also said that all food
and clothing not distributed
will be sent to Goodwill to be
sold for a small donation.

”Blessed are the peacemak-
ers,” said Chris Field, a high
school sophomore, as he
came to the shanty in search
of volunteer work. ”This
needs to be done.”

Page explained that in ord-
er to set up the shanty the NSN
had to obtain a permit from
the Office of Community Serv-
ices. He also said that the Pitt
administration, including the
Student Government Board
and the campus police, have
been very helpful in aiding
them through. the necessary
red tape and by offering them
protection during the night.

”Everyone is part of the net-
work. If you support the home-
less, you're a member," said
Page.

GALA anti—discrimination clause meetsopposition

Republicans’ opposition to the
sexual orientation clause is in-
dicative of the prejudice which
exists on campus.”

Upon questioning from
Rapoport, Confer said he had not
called the university's Affirmative
Action office to ask if anyone had

reported incidents of discrimina-
tion. Confer said he has not con-
ducted any formal research into
the question of whether discrimi-
nation exists.

Kyle Bates, chairperson of the
College Republicans, said all 70
members of the organization op-
pose the inclusion of the sexual
orientation clause.

Bates, who said he has been
registering voters around campus,
said 95 percent of the people he
registered oppose the inclusion of
sexual orientation to the EOS.

Bates estimated the number of

finishing touches to the NSN homeless shanty.‘

people he registered to be about
50.

Confer and Bates said the Col-
lege Republicans are circulating
petitions opposing the measure‘.

The SGB last week issued a let-
ter to University President Wes-
ley Posvar, which asks Posvar to
address the issue of discrimi-
nation.

The letter read, in part, ”We,
the SG B, respectfully request that
you issue a formal policy state-
ment prohibiting discrimination
on grounds of sexual orien-
tation."

The Board claimed, in the let-
ter, that the ultimate goal is to
have the phrase included in the
EOS.

”[Homosexuals] are already
implicitly protected by the exist-
ing EOS,” Confer said, citing the
”sex" and ”marital status” por-
tions of the statement.

Marine’s captors release video of their demands

BEIRLJT, Lebanon ---~- The kid-
nappers of a US. Marine officer
released a videotape Monday in
which he recited their demands,
including withdrawal by Israel
from its border ”security z.one"
in south Lebanon.

Lt. Col. William R. Higgins,
who appeared to be reading from
a text written by his captors, said
Pre.siclent Reagan ’’has to take
responsibility for the crimes he
has committed against the op-
pressed people in the region.”

Higgins was abducted last
Wednesday on a highway south
of Tyre, the ancient port St) miles
south of Beirut.

/\ group calling itself the ()r-
ganization of the Oppressed on
Faith, which claimed responsibil-
ity for the abduction, released the
7()-second tape.

Amal militiamen and troops of
the U.N. peacekeeping force in
south Lebanon, using dogs,
searched the caves and groves of
the Tyre area for the sixth day
Monday without result.

Higgins is commander of the
76-man Observer Group-

lebanon attached to the U.N. In-
terim Force in Lebanon, or
UNIFIL, the south Lebanon pea-
cekeeping force.

Hezbollah claimed the
4 t-year-old Marine from Dari-
ville, Ky., was removed from the
area despite a dragnet by Amal
and UN. security officers.
Release of the tape, delivered to
a Western news agency in Beirut,
suggested the al'iductors were
able to get Higgins out.

’’It is hard to believe that a
videotape can be produced it the
captive is held in a dangerous
hideout," said an independent,
informed Shiite source, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.

Naval head Webb

resigns; blasts budget

WASHINGTON «- Navy
Secretary James H. Webb said
Monday the administration had
sacrificed its goal of a 600-ship

fleet and submitted his resigna-
tion to President Reagan.

Webb, in his letter of resigna-
tion ancl in a meeting with report-
ers, said he decided to leave
because he could not support the
fiscal i989 Pentagon budget
proposal crafted by Defense
Secretary Frank C. Carlucci.

Webb also strongly criticized
Carlucci as a bureaucrat who was
not providing leadership to the
Pentagon.

Referring to the internal budg-
et debate that led to last week's
submission of the fiscal W8‘)
budget, Webb wrote to Reagan:

”()n three separate occasions,
the uniformed and civilian
leadership of the Navy Depart-
ment provided the secretary of
defense with proposed c uts total-
ing the amount required to meet
the budget reduction, but which
also would preserve the
cherished goal of your adminis-
tration to rebuild our Navy to a
minimum of b()() ships."

tions ”were rejected by your

when it killed a challenge to the
required use of ”godless” te><I~

Discrimination is
a problem at Pitt

Another sad chapter in the fight to include a sexual orienta-
tion clause in the Equal Opportunity Statement of the univer-
sity was played out at last night's meeting of the Student

Government Board.

Roan Confer and Kyle Bates, both members of the College
Republicans, spoke out against the need for inclusion of such
a statement. They claimed that there was not sufficient evidence
of discrimination because of sexual orientation and that such
an addition to the EOS would ”promote homosexual behavior

and activity.”

We see the situation a little differently.

The College Republicans speaking at the meeting said that
they opposed discrimination in any form. The Office of Affir-
mative Action has documented cases of discrimination against
homosexuals. The College Republicans claim, admitting that
they have done little investigation beyond the questioning of
their peers and members of their organization, that there is no
reason to assume that sexual—orientation discrimination exists.
The Office of Affirmative Action has done their homework. They

say that discrimination exists.

In coming to the meeting to protest the inclusion of the clause
on the basis that no discrimination exists and that the propo-
nents of the amendment are interested in imposing their be-
liefs on others, the College Republicans have done little to instill
a feeling of comfort among the gay population that there is no
discrimination. That there are students willing to speak out
against a clause to ease the documented problems of homosex-
ua_ls, while surely not proof of discriminatory attitudes, is a fright-
ening intimation of fears that lead too easily to outright

discrimination.

The reining in of the language

Like, I mean, like the whole
thing is totally rad. Like, when I
was walking to school today,
right, like there was this guy, you
know, and he was the grossest
dude I had ever, like, seen. You
know?

Ack.

There's something missing
from the spoken language.
There's a void that opens up in
a lot of conversations of which I
am a part, swallowing ideas and
conviction at a furious pace. I
refer to the superlative’s loss of
meaning.

When I sit back and think
about all the hours I spent in hot,
mind-dulling classrooms in high
school, and about all the nearly
useful things I learned there, I
remember the definition of super-
lative I was given.

A superlative, I was taught, was
to be used in the expression of
greatness or barely tolerable mis-
ery. Dante furrowed ground fer-
tile for superlatives. It was at the

MATTHEW
THORNTON

top of the comparison continu-
um: Good, better, best. A super-
lative described the Sing-Sing
riots. It facilitated an understand-
ing of an Olympic athlete's ela-
tion. The superlative was the
outer limit of the language’s ca-
pacity for description.

Now, however, the superlative
has been conscripted to serve less
noble ends. The other day I heard
a stubbed toe described as being
”like, the worst possible pain.” A
little rain has become the ”nasti-
est of all possible weather" (I
apologize that I can't denote the
inflection, the self-satisfied flights
of tone that, like, mar so many
vocabularies, usually those of
people well-versed in the relative
values of competing light beers.
dude)

The Cajun king of swing: Is he God

Father forgive me. I tried not to
do it. It's a sin. I think the Pet
Shop Boys have written the Jim-
my Swaggart theme song.

Strange, that song came on the
radio just as I sat down to write
a column about Swaggart, at-
tempting to generate an idea that
would do more than ‘criticize
Swaggart for his lewd and lascivi—
ous behavior.

Even Swaggart admits it: "I call
it a sin." Coming clean, ah 
that's the sign of a true man of the
Lord. The guy was busted flat in
Baton Rouge.

He also said that he ”never
skirted or sidestepped unpleasan-
tries." But maybe that was be-
cause he was more into
un—skirting pleasantries.

There is, however, comfort to
be taken — despite the obscene
moral violations he has commit-
ted — in the fact that he has
placed his lovely and devoted
wife Frances (how could anyone
with that name be other than
lovely anyway?) on the same
pedestal with God. Let me
explain.

Swaggart was quoted as saying,

"I have sinned against you, and
I beg your forgiveness,” add ress—
ing his wife.

Swaggart also remarked that he
had sinned against other TV
ministers. I did not know one
could sin against another human
being.

If we begin to analyze this
nuclear statement, through
deductive reasoning, we can eas-
ily conclude that Swaggart thinks
he is God. C’mon, let's do it
together. It'll be fun.

OK, now we've already estab-
lished that he told his wife and
fellow evangelists he sinned
against them. That is our first
given.

The next step is to see what the
Assemblies of God denomination
has to say about sinning against
another human being. First,
though, I have to tell you when
I called directory assistance in Ba-
ton Rouge, La., and asked for the
number for the Assemblies of
God denomination, the operator
laughed, then gave me the
number.

My question to the representa-
tive from the Assemblies of God

FRANCES
SANSIG

denomination was this: "Is it pos-
sible to sin against another hu-
man being, or can a human only
commit a sin against God?"

The unidentified man began to
recite the assembly line (pun in-
tended) answer, which I couldn't
blame him for because I imagine
that the poor fellow had been get-
ting calls all day.

He referred me to Psalm 51 in
the Old Testament of the Bible
and began rambling something
about David committing adultery
with Bathsheba.

So I restated my question.

"When a person sins, he sins
against God. You can do some-
thing wrong to another person,
but you're really sinning against
God," he said.

I consulted Psalm 51. It clearly
states that after David confessed
he was guilty of hanky-panky
with Bathy baby, ”Against Thee,
Thee only, have I sinned, and

done this evil in Thy sight.”

David should thank his lucky
stars Ted Koppel wasn't around
then, or more than God would
have seen his evil.

If we are to take the Bible liter-
ally, we can presume that David
acknowledges the fact that the
only person he could have com-
mitted a sin against was God,
thus merely making Bathsheba
the medium, or mode, of his
adulterous mortal sin.

If he claims that he sinned
against his wife and other TV
ministers, this means that he
thinks his wife is God and that the
other TV ministers are God be-
cause you can only sin against
God. Let us refer to this as our
second given.

But since we know that God
can't be a woman, we have thus
eliminated Mrs. Swaggart from
our list ofpotential Gods.

But, you ask, where does Jim-
my come in?

Perhaps a review is in order be-
fore we commence to the next
phase of our theory:

1. Jimmy Swaggart sinned
against his wife and his fellow

, It's not misuse that bothers me.
Certainly, I'm guilty of grammat-
ical mistakes at least as often as
anyone else I know. It's the rein-
ing in of the language, the
removal of its ability to commu-
nicate severity that has me
worried.

”I have the best news for you,"
I often hear. Strangely, though, to-
day's best news is always
replaced by tomorrow's: the best,
again.

”This is the worst day I've ever
had,” was the sentiment of one
student with whom I recently
spoke. Which is funny, because
not a week before that, he had
told me that the worst day ever
was upon him. And the week be-
fore that. Either he was taking part
in the castration of the superla-
tive, or his life was crashing down
around him in the best Victor
Hugo tradition.

Remembering his equally fer-
vent remarks about a party he had
attended, I suspected the latter.

or what?

ministers.

2. A human being can only sin

against God.

3. Therefore, Mrs. Swaggart
and people like Ernest Angeley
are all potentially God.

4. Mrs. Swaggart cannot be
God because she is a woman.

5. Since he referred to all TV
evangelists as a group, and there
can only be one God, we have
thus sweepingly removed all the
other TV ministers from the pool
of potential Cods.

So, if all the other people Swag-
gart said he sinned against were
potentially God, this would make
him God by association. Since
we have eliminated the others,
we can therefore safely say Jim-

my Swaggart is God -— with briI- I

liant reasoning that closely
emulates that of the many well-
known evangelists. Make sense?
Why, of course, dear brethren.
Oh, and one more thing. I
guess we can at least believe
Swaggart was on the up-and-up
when he told us rock legend Jer-
ry Lee Lewis was his cousin.
Maybe it has something to do
with the line, Great Balls of Fire.

At a picture-taking session,
Gorbachev said the Soviets

peace in Afghanistan and to have
a non—a|igned_, neutral Af-

good relations with its neighbors,
with the United States and with
the Soviet Union.”

At the news conference, Shultz

would leave Afghanistan. But
Shultz, who came here saying he
would seek a specific timetable,
gave no evidence he had
received one.

Stewart turns down pro volleyball offer

By Don Boyd

Staff Writer

The NCAA has a nice term for
those who participate in athletics
at its membership institutions —
they are called student-athletes.

This term refers to an individu-
al who is making reasonable aca-
demic progress toward his or her
degree while participating in ath-
letics.

Unfortunately, the term
student—athlete often consists of
two mutually exclusive words.
The ”student—athlete" often de-
cides to forsake his or her aca-
demic opportunity, either by
poor academic performance or

by quitting school to seek gold on
the athletic fields of America.

Pitt volleyball star Lisa Stewart
was recently confronted with the
issue of academics versus athlet-
ics. Not long ago, Lisa was con-
tacted by the Women's
Professional Volleyball League
about the possibility of playing
professional volleyball for the
next three months.

As with anything, there was a
price involved. She would have
had to quit school and forego
graduation this spring.

Stewart recalls the sequence of
events that led up to her decision:

I had a letter from a pro team up

Bryant's performance
too hot to handle as
Pirates burn Pitt, 89-72

By John Enright
Editor in Chief

EAST RUTHERFORD, NJ -
Seldom-used center Steve Mas-
lek’s layup gave Pitt a 66-64 lead
with 6:22 left in last night's game
against Seton Hall at
Meadowlands Arena. A good
omen for the Panthers?

Hardly.

Pitt's next five possessions
produced three turnovers, a
blocked shot and a wild miss on
a jumper by Charles Smith.

Meanwhile, Seton Hall scored
the next seven points and never
looked back, beating the Panthers
89-72. Pitt's fourth loss on the
season was it's worst in the Big
East under second-year coach
Paul Evans.

”This was a case of Seton Hall
outhustling us and outworking us
and wanting it more. Our inten-
sity was very poor. We may have
been drained emotionally after
the Georgetown game, but we
shouldn't have been,” Evans said.

The loss dropped Pitt, ranked
sixth by the Associated Press, to
9-3 in Big East play, just a half
game ahead of second place
Syracuse. The Panthers are 19-4
overall.

Sixth place Seton Hall im-
proved it's record to 6-7 and
17-1 1. The Pirates have won five
out of their last six games.

P.J. Carlesimo, Seton Hall's
coach, said this was the biggest
game in his six years as the

Pirates mentor.

He is in the last year of his con-
tract and rumors are circulating
that he could be gone after this
season.

”To beat a nationally—ranked
team in a big game means a lot
to us. We played our way back
into post-season contention,”
Carlesimo said.

”Seton Hall matches up well
with us. lthink they're an NCAA
team,” Evans said.

After leading at halftime 44-42,
Pitt couldn't take control in the
opening minutes of the second
half. Pitt still led 64-62 with 8:38
left, but Seton Hall was doing it's
damage on the inside. Forward
Mark Bryant had 12 points and
center Raymon Ramos added
four in the first 10 minutes.

Forward Michael Cooper hit
two foul shots to tie the game at
64, starting an 18-2 Seton Hall
run.

One play in particular
epitomized Pitt's performance.
With Seton Hall leading 68-66,
guard James Major missed a
3—pointer, and Bryant got the re-
bound and went up for a shot. He
missed, but Smith couldn't con-
trol the rebound and lost the ball
out of bounds. Bryant then snuck
underneath Pitt's defense and
was fouled by Jerome Lane. He
hit two foul shots and Pitt wasn't
heard from again.

”They put everything on the
line. We were pretty flat after the

Please see Game, page 6

at Shelton’s [Pitt coach Shelton
Collier] office. Shelton and I dis-
cussed it. i would have to quit
school to play. It would have
been a great opportunity, but
three months of volleyball is not
worth me not graduating.”

Collier was justifiably proud of
Stewart.

’’I met with Lisa to discuss play-

ing in the professional league.
She was excited and flattered
about the opportunity, but there
was little discussion about play-
ing this year. Lisa wants to finish
school and get her degree in
April," said Collier.

Lisa transferred to Pitt from the
University of Tennessee at the

conclusion of her freshman year.
Times have not always been as
good as they are now.

"When Lisa came to Pitt origi-
nally, she wasn't doing well in
the classroom, and the volleyball
team suffered one of its worst
years ever," remembers Collier.

Stewart's desire to excel was to
lead to dramatic improvements in
the classroom as well as on the
court. Commenting on his
5—foot-9 outside-hitter, Collier
had this to say: ”Lisa, as an in-
dividual, has improved academ-
ically and also as a team leader.
She has gotten stronger academ-
ically each term. This past fall,
Lisa had a 3.6 GPA in her major,

social work, despite the travel,
the team's success [3 7-6] and her
role on the team.”

The accolades have continued
rolling in for Stewart. She was
named to the Athletic Director's
Honor Roll as well as the Big East
Academic All-Star team. Lisa's
athletic performance was the
kind you would expect of an ath-
lete courted by the professional
league. She was named to the Big
East All-Conference team as well
as being selected to the All-
Northeast Regional team.

At the conclusion of this past
season, Lisa was selected to play
in the inaugural Yugo East-West

Track team 2nd in Big East championship

By Don Boyd

Staff Writer

The Pitt men's track team
finished second to Georgetown
in the Big East Track and Field
Championships held at Syracuse
this past weekend.

Georgetown scored 149‘/2
points to topple the defending
champion Panthers, who finished
with 126 points. One of the keys
to the championship was George-
town's ability to outscore Pitt in
the field events by 40 points.

Pitt coach John Vasvary as-
sessed his team's performance,
”The kids ran great. We did
about as well as we could do. I
have mixed feelings. Of course,
you would like to win the cham-
pionship, but I am proud of our
team's performance. Our kids
gave a championship per-
formance.”

Turning in championship ef-
forts for the Panthers were Lee
McRae, Eric Cannon, Elbert Ellis
and the 4x400 relay team of El-
lis, Rowan Mighty, Chop Burton

and Dave Price.

On Saturday, McRae won the
200-meter dash, edging out fel-
low Panther Cannon 21.65 to
21.66. The following day, McRae
won the 60—meter dash in 6.26
with Cannon (6.40) and Zeke
Gadson (6.42) finishing fourth
and fifth.

Cannon led a 1-2-3-4 sweep by
the Panthers in the 55—meter hur-
dles, being clocked in 7.30. Pitt's
Ellis (7.41), Calvin Holmes (7.48)
and George lfill (7.49) finished
second through fourth.

Ellis wrote another chapter in
his phenomenal freshman season
by winning the 400—meter run in
47.85 while teammates Mighty
(48.64) and Price (48.72) finished
second and third.

The winning ways of Ellis con-
tinued as he led off for Pitt in the
victorious 4x400 relay, which
ran 3:14.52.

Dave Moore turned in another
strong performance in taking the
runner—up spot in the 800-meter
run in a time 1:50.81, while lfill
finished second in the long jump

(24—feet-3 1%) in scoring Pitt's only
field event points.

The Panthers distance medley
relay team of Moore, Holmes,
Tom Boggan and Zac Shea
finished third in their event while
the 4 X800-relay team of Joe
Daniels, Mike Thomas, Tony
Brookover and Moore finished
fourth in theirs.

Paul Friedrich finished sixth in
the 3000-meter run by running a
8:37.46 time while the Panthers
got fifth and sixth place finishes

last ball game. That's why we
lost,” Smith said.

Seton Hall outscored Pitt 47-28
in the second half.

Smith, who could muster only
six second half points and 12 to-
tal, went to the foul line for a one-
and-one with 2:36 left and Pitt
down, 76-68. But after making 15
of 17 foul shots against Geor-
getown on Saturday, Smith bare-
ly got the ball to the rim, just
scratching iron.

”ln the last few minutes, I
thought, except for Sean Miller,
our guys gave up. They thought
it was over,” Evans said.

Four Panthers departed in the
last 2:13 due to fouls. Smith exit-
ed first, followed by Jason Mat-
thews, Demetreus Gore and
Lane.

Seton Hall was 22-25 from the

line (88 percent).

"Charles told me to be ready.
Those guys played a good
game,” Miller said.

Gore led Pitt with 18 points.
He hyper—extended his right knee
in the second half. The serious-
ness of the injury wasn't known
after the game. Lane added 13
points and Miller had 12.

While the Panthers were turn-
ing the ball over, failing to get re-
bounds and generally making
their coach irate, Bryant went to
town. The 6-foot-9 senior scored
a career—high 32 points and
grabbed 16 rebounds.

Bryant owned the paint as he
scored 20 second half points.

Guard John Morton added 17
and Ramos had 12.

”Mark’s effort was what we
needed to beat a team like Pitt.
He's a big time ball player,"

Carlesimo said.

Pitt couldn't get the defensive
rebounds in the second half.
Well, actually they got seven, but
the Pirates scrapped for 1 1 offen-
sive boards.

Maybe the Panthers were still
thinking about the fight against
Georgetown. Then again, maybe
not. On this night, Pitt was
punchless.

The Panthers were outrebound-
ed 41-32 overall. ’’In the first half
our rebounding sucked, ” Evans
said. It was worse in the last 20
minutes as Seton Hall dominated
the boards 25-14.

Lane had only five rebounds, a
season low.

Morton had seven steals and
nine assists on the night. Seton
Hall turned the ball over only 12
times.

”Their guards are not known
for handling the ball for forty
minutes, but they executed the
offense well tonight,” Evans said.

Pitt didn't do the same. Said
Evans: ’’If we reversed the ball,
we would have had mismatches
inside. And it would have been
a completely different game.”

Lady Panthers still confident of
ability despite sub-par record

By Matt Martin

Assistant Sports Editor

When a basketballl team has a
losing record with only two
games remaining on its schedule,
it has almost no chance to ad-
vance to postseason play unless
that team wins its league tour-
nament.

The Pitt Lady Panthers are in
that situation right now. With a
3-11 Big,East record (11-14 over-
all), the Lady Panthers are in
ninth and last place in the con-
ference. They must play Seton
Hall away on Wednesday night
and league powerhouse Villano-
va this Saturday at Fitzgerald
Field House.

"It's an absolute must to beat
Seton Hall,” Lady Panther head
coach Kirk Bruce said. ”We don’t
want to go into the Villanova
game needing a win.”

Pitt has already defeated Seton
Hall once this season, 85-79, at
the Field House.

Villanova beat Pitt 71-64 in
Philadelphia on Jan. 28.

But even if Pitt loses both
games, the Lady Panthers will
have a distinct advantage in this
situation.

Pitt will play host to the Big East

ment March 3 through 6. The
home—court advantage could play
a large role in Pitt's chances of
winning the tourney.

But the Lady Panthers may not
have to rely on this advantage, for
this is not the same team it was
earlier in the season. Game ex-
perience has helped the Lady
Panthers improve on previous ef-
forts against Big East teams, most
notably Georgetown and St.
John's.

Pitt defeated Georgetown
76-64 last week at the Field
House after losing to the Hoyas
69-64 earlier in the season.

And although the Lady Pan-
thers lost 80-77 to St. John's this
past Saturday, they improved
greatly from a 76-66 defeat on
Jan. 20.

Pitt led the Express by five
points at halftime and had a
chance to send the game to over-

time, but senior Sally Sheerer’s
three—pointer at the buzzer
missed its mark.

”We played hard  about as
hard as we can play,” Bruce said
of the St. John's game.

But the game against Seton
Hall is on the Lady Panthers’
minds right now. Pitt shut down
play-making Pirate guard Kathy
O’Reilly in the previous game by
shuffling guards Denise Becher,
Jill Sitlinger and Karen Threatt on
defense.

If the Lady Panthers can again
limit O’Reilly’s passing to power-
ful inside players like Debbie
Hartnett and Geraldine Saintilus,
they have a good chance at
repeating their previous success.

”The ultimate would be to beat
Seton Hall, come home and beat
Villanova and then play Villano-
va again in the tournament,”
Bruce said.

BRADENTON, Fla. —
Manager Jim Leyland said the
Pittsburgh Pirates "are a pret-
ty darn good team right now”
-— but he's not about to predict
a 1988 National League East
championship.

After finishing last for three
consecutive seasons, the
Pirates won 27 of their final 38
games last year to tie Philadel-
phia for fourth place in the NL
East.

”You put the Mets on paper
and us on paper, and the Mets
probably have a better team,”
Leyland said. "But, who
knows? You get on a roll,
somebody slips up 

”l'm not going to say we're
going to win. But I'm sure not
going to say we can’t.”

Leyland said the Pirates
must avoid overconfidence,
just as they strived in recent
seasons to develop confidence
after being one of baseball's
worst teams.

”l've guarded against it my-

Leyland looks forward
to this year's Pirates

self,” Leyland said. ’’I don’t
want to put any extra pressure
on this team with fantastic ex-
pectations.

”We have to focus ourselves
and not get too wrapped up in
what everybody expects. We
have to approach it like we did
the last two years.  l think
we've got a gung—ho group
that is sold on making this
thing work."

The Pirates won 80 games
last season, but Leyland won't
predict a won-lost record for
1988.

’’I don’t know if I'm smart
enough to do that,” Leyland
said. ’’I don’t know if any
manager is smart enough to do
that. I think we'll be able to
win more close games be-
cause our defense is better,
and our pitching is better.

”We’re probably ahead of
schedule, but you can't get
carried away and say you're
home free. We're still a long
way from home.”
