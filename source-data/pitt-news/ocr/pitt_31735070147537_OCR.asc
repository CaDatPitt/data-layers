City Council voted 9-0 yesterday to ban Mar-
cellus Shale gas drilling within Pittsburgh city
limits. The decision makes Pittsburgh the ﬁrst
municipality in the state to stop corporations
from extracting energy resources buried miles
beneath its streets.

Council and community members who
supported the ban pointed to health dangers
associated with the controversial fracking
practices used to extract natural gas from
the shale. Critics of the ban said it will divert
money and jobs from the city.

In a news release following the vote, coun-
cilman Doug Shields said the new ordinance
“recognizes and secures expanded civil rights
for the people of Pittsburgh, and it prohibits
activities which would violate those righ .”

“[The ban] protects the authority of the

people of Pittsburgh  by undoing corporate
privileges that place the rights of the people of
Pittsburgh at the mercy of gas corporations,”
Shields said.

The ordinance was drafted by the Com-
munity Environmental Legal Defense Fund
— a nonproﬁt, public interest law ﬁrm provid-
ing free legal services to communities facing
threats to their local environments — at the in-
vitation of councilman Bill Peduto and was first
introduced by councilman Doug Shields. -

Shields represents District 5, which in-
cludes part of Squirrel Hill, Point Breeze and
neighboring areas. In an interview following
the vote, Shields said he does not expect any

Delays in constitutional revisions mean
that next year, students will continue to
vote for only five candidates during the
SGB elections.

Although the Board initially planned
to have constitutional revisions on
Thursday’s ballot, President Charlie;
Shull said after the meeting that the
Board had not finished completing the
revisions process. ‘

The delays were not mentioned dur-
ing last night’s meeting.

The Board established a- Consti-
tutional Review Committee in mid-
October, but didn’t set an anticipated
completion date for revisions.» Possible
revisions that would have appeared on
Thursday’s ballot would have addressed
an ambiguity over whether freshmen
could run for Board and correct a dis—
crepancy between the Election Code and
constitution.

Currently, the Election Code — re-
vised by SGB’ earlier this year — and the
constitution offer conflicting informa-
tion about how many Board member
candidates students can vote for.

“From what we’ve seen so far, the tone of the
industry is, ‘Let the sleeping dog 1ie,”’ Shields
said. “They may have some legal ground to
make claims, but the political consequences
of that would be too great. They don’t want

“We [the Board] were a little slow on

Shull said that some of the revisions
— such as those to improve grammar

law late next week. .
A “He can’t really veto when council goes nine

to zero,” Shields said.

For months before the vote, anti—drilling .‘
activists have blamed fracking for explosions,
the contamination of drinking water, rivers
and streams, and even for decreasing property .
values of homes near drilling sites.

Under the ordinance, private corporations
that seek to drill in the city will not be afforded
“personhood” rights under the U.S. or Pem1syl-
Vania Constitution, “nor will they be afforded
protections under the Commerce Clause or
Contracts.Clause under the federal or state
constitution,” according to the release.

‘ ‘ Shields said gas companies own or are leas-
ing 1,500 acres of land within city limits.

“With this vote we are asserting the right
of the city to make critical decisions to protect
our health, safety and welfare,” Shields said.
“We are not a colony of the state and will not
sit quietly by as our city gets drilled.”

Currently, state law permits companies to

V extract natural gas by means of the fracking

process. A 2004 study by the Environmen-
tal Protection Agency found the process to
be safe, but the agency is currently conduct-
ing additional investigations into the mining-
technique. ' ‘ 4
Shortly following the ﬁnal vote, Klaber is-
sued a critical statement, bashing City Council
for “attacking” individual property rights.
“The vote represents a blow to the city’s

I weak ﬁnancial standing, and at the same time is

a straightforward attack on individual property
rights,” she said. “At a time when the natural

gas industry is generating j obs and prosperity .

for tens of thousands of Pennsylvanians and
economic development across the Common-
wealth, it’s unfortunate that the council contin~
ues to maintain a shortsighted view regarding
responsible shale gas development.”ﬂ

EDITORIAL

Don’t ignore posts

In our Sept. 15 staff editorial, The Pitt News
lauded the Internet’s ability to impart certain
freedoms on its users. Speciﬁcally, we noted
how Web-provided anonymity can encour-
age students to sign up for online weight-loss
courses, and therefore free them from others’
perceptions or expectations. Hence, suchadigi-
tal social shield can empower people to make
good decisions.

But as a new study suggests, this shield can

also make it easy for people to hide from social '

responsibilities.

MTV’s 24-hour college network, mtvU,
the Jed Foundation and the Associated Press
conducted a study among a group of college
students in an effort to gauge the relationship
between emotional health and technology for
college students. _

The study found that although about 70 per-
cent of students report they’ve read something

posted by someone close to them on a social .

networking site that sounded like that person
was crying outfor emotional help, less thanhalf
would actually make a personal visit, and even
fewer would contact the appropriate officials.
We don’t have to run through the tragic se-
ries of highly publicized student suicides that

has recently unraveled to demonstrate the fact
that mental health is a huge issue amongyoung
people — one that should not be ignored.

Think about it: 20 percent of college students
in the mtvU study said they had friends who
talked about ending their lives in the past year,
and the CDC reports that suicide is the third
leading cause of death among young people
and that almost 150,000 youths receive medical

treatment for "self-inﬂicted injuries each year.
You’d think social networking sites by their
very nature would exponentially improve ac-
cess to supportive friends for people in need.
To a large extent, sites like Facebook might
actually be functioning that way, but the mtvU
study suggests that something else, something
counteractive and consequently dangerous, is
happeningat the same time: Users are becom-

ing desensitized. -

The problem lies in our changing discourse.
Internet posts like, “F**k my life,” or “someone
just  me right now,” or even depressing song
lyrics are so ubiquitous these days that people
ﬁnd the distinction between cries for help and
mere expressions of stress increasingly hazy. As
the study points out, about halfof students are

But if the House takeoverwasthe Republican

control of19 statelegislativebodies,bringingtheir
total to 55 of 99. Indeed, here in Pennsylvania,
the very geatest state of the Union, they ﬁnally
gained control of the state House. Alongvvith t:he
already—red Senate andwith Govemor-electTom
Corbett, this gives the GOP complete control of
the state government.

This newly solidiﬁed governmental authority
comes at an important juncture and could hold
national importance —-— and not onlyforthe short
term. It’s decennial  time. Once the
results of the 2010 U.S. Census are in, states will
be responsible for redrawing the lines of their

and it will be up to the state’s now—Republican

A former rock ’n’ roll manager hopes that by tak-
ing bellydancing out ofbars and restaurants and
bringing it into the Byham Theater, he will be
able to teach Pittsburgh audiences to appreciate
an aspect of Middle Eastern culture.

Performing almost 800 shows in 22 countries
since its creation in 2003, Bellydance Superstars
has performed for a vast array of audiences. The
dancers have dance backgrounds ranging from
classical ballet to traditional Egyptian. Using
Egyptian and cabaret styles, the group hopes
to change people’s perceptions of the art of bel-
lydance internationally.

Miles Copeland IH,founderandproducerfor 4

the production, has madeaglobal namefor him-
selfwith his management of musicians like the
Police, Sting and the Go-Gos. This is Copeland’s
most recent venture within the entertainment
business, and although it is different from a rock
’n’ roll band, he ﬁnds it even more rewarding.

“When I look at my rock ’n’ roll world to what
I’m doing now, the bellydance world is more re-
wardingbecause there are so many more ofthese
social and cultural aspects to it,” Copeland said.
“This has another dimension to it that is really
interesting.”

Copeland’s Bellydance Superstars say they are
the only touring professional dance group of their

kind. At ﬁrst, it was a struggle to get people to.

realize that bellydancewas somethingthat could
be interesting — the same type of struggle that
Copeland hadwhen hewasﬁrsttryingto promote
the Police. People shrugged off the band’s new—age
music, just like people shrugged offbellydancing
as a new-age performance.

“We had to overcome a lot of prejudice both
from the community, who were suspicious, and
from the media who thought that this art form
was only for men and people who were from the
Middle East,” Copeland said.

Originally, bellydancing was performed in
settings where the audiencewas distracted. 'I‘ypi—
cally performed in a restaurant environment,
bellydance has not been given the esteem that
riverdance or ballet has achieved by being per-
formed in theaters. But, country by country, the
group is showing the art form in theaters and
trying to change these perceptions.

“Bellydance Superstars as a company does
somethingthat nobody thought possible,” said Pe-
titejamilla, a dancer for Bellydance Superstars.

Jamilla has been with Bellydance Superstars

since 2004, and she said the experience has been
culturally revealing.

“For the Arab community, I can’t even tell you
how many comments we get from people telling
us ‘I’rn so proud to see bellydance in such a huge
production, put in atheaterand people respecting

it and clapping for it and appreciating it without -

a dinner in hand or next to alcohol or without it
being in a restaurant,’?’Jamill'a said.

Through the art of dance, the group has
brought together two cultures that have had a
rocky path toward acceptance.

“WhenIhave Middle Eastern people come to
see the show inAmerica, I am always approached
and told how wonderful it is to see and feel that
their culture does have relevance, and Americans
are appreciatingsomething from their culture,”
Copeland said. “While Bellydance Superstars

doesn’t politically advocate this acceptance, I
think that it has a stronger impact on Ameri-
can life because it is a subtle infusion of Arabic
culture.”

There, is a powerful element to art that can
impact society because of its cultural signiﬁ-
cance. Whereas Bellydance Superstars does not
make it its agenda to heal political and social
tensions with the Middle East and America, the
possibility of makingpeople more open—minded
through dance is a beneﬁcial side effect for this
company.

Folk music
continues
to evolve

Patrick Wagner
Columnist

Though folk music often brings about images
of Pete Seeger and Bob Dylan, the genre has
adapted to the changing musical climate by
using different instrumentation to reﬂect
the changing times.

There’s something about a person using
his voice and an electric guitar that has always
struck a chord with me — literally and ﬁgu-
ratively. Sure, an acoustic guitar seems like
the proper instrumentation of a respected
singer—songwriter, but the raw power that
someone can hold in his hands can create
its own sonic splendor. N 0 two artists do this
better than two punk—rock troubadours sepa-
rated by an ocean and 20 years, but united
by a folk-music tradition that can sometimes
beachingly sincere.

Billy Bragg ﬁrst came to prominence in
England with the 1983 release of Lfeir a Riot
wit/9 Sp} Vs. Sp}. Playing at 45 rpm in fewer
than 20 minutes, it was really more of an
EP. But Bragg’s songs communicated more
than an album’s worth of romantic and left-
wing political sentiment. Thejsongs teeter
on this line,,making the personal public and
the public personal.

One of Bragg’s compositions on that re-
lease, “A New England,” would later be a pop
hit in England for songstress Kirsty MacColl.

On Bragg’s version, he belts it out like it’s his .

last plea for attention while he plows through
power chords beneath it. “I don’t want to
change the world,” Bragg’s lyricssay. “I’m not
looking for a new England / I’m just looking
for another girl.”

Perhaps the album’s most famous song
for Bragg is “To Have and ,To Have Not,” a
song about living in a system people born
into poverty have little chance of moving
up. When Bragg sings the ﬁrst lines of the
chorus — “Just because you’re better than
me / Doesn’t mean I’m lazy” — it has a jar-
ring impact. '

Besides these poignantly political songs,
Bragg has also written some great ballads
— for lack of a better term —— that use his
stripped-down approach to great ends. “The
Saturday Boy” from Brewing Up With Bi/_/y

Bragg is a great example of this. It is one of
the most truly moving love songs that you’re
likely to encounter. Bragg puts his lyrics over
slow, meticulous chords: “In the end it took
me a dictionary/ To ﬁnd out the meaning of
unrequited / While she was giving herself
for free / At a party to which I was never
invited.”

The songs inclusion of a trumpet solo also
signals a shift for Bragg, who previously had
only featured his voice and guitar. He would
go on to play with a band supporting him ——
usually called the Blokes — for more than 10

‘ albums in the next 20 years. During that time,

“To Have and To Have Not” wascovered by
an American artist, Lars Frederiksen, playing
in much’ of the same tradition as Bragg.

Frederiksen played with legendary punks,
the UK Subs —— short-for United Kingdom
Subversives —— before j oining Tim Armstrong
and Matt Freeman as a member of Rancid in
1993. By the early 2000s, though, Frederik-
sen wanted to pursue a more personal musi-
cal venture, and he found it in the Bastards,
his own band that emphasized his personal
voice and guitar work.

— Fronting the Bastards, he co—wrote ‘the
songs with Armstrong but sang each of them
with the same kind of personal sincerity that
Bragg pioneered in punk 20 years before.
Over two albums, 2001’s Lars Fredenkren
and 2‘/ye Bastards and 20o4’s T/zking, Freder-
iksen moved between songs about his home,
his love life and the lack of opportunity in
America with an ease that underscores the
connection between those themes. Noth-
ing is isolated in the human condition, and

A the breadth of Frederiksen’s songs explores

   

   

just that.

“Skunx,” a song from his ﬁrst album is
a punk—rock anthem in which Frederiksen
sings about life in the eponymous street
gang, beginning with fast downstrokes and
his emotive voice before adding the power of
his band. He adapts‘ Bragg-’s “To Have and To
Have Not” with one of the verses replaced to
make it his — something of a folk tradition.
Where Bragg philosophizeda about keeping
yourself together, Frederiksen says in his
own lyrics, “I dropped out ‘of high school in

Campbell, California / I got a guitar, and I

never looked back.”

’ VI/'z',€lz'r2<gwas controversial upon its release,
as  was perceived by some as being de-
grading to womenzithrough its [sometimes
uncomfortably personal lyrics and a cover
design that featured two buxom models. But
within the context of the work, those choices
are necessary. _ _

“My Life to Live” details Lars Frederik-
sen and the Bastards’ sexual excesses with

- a perspective that’s uncomfortable on the

ﬁrst listen, but upon further listening lends
credence to a surprisinglyasentimental man.
“The Viking” is the album’s ﬁnal track, and
it acts as one of the most achingly personal
songs in the punk—rock idiom. “Well how

do you do? My name is Lars,” the song be~ 
gins while Frederiksen plays a simple set

of chords. He continues this confessional
nature, detailing the experiences he had as
he ‘_‘grew into a man.” _ _

Both Bragg and Frederiksen perform in a
tradition that has its -roots in punk rock but
ﬁnds its soul a little closer to what we might
consider folk.

 THROWING A KIRSCH BALL

Bucs mak right call with Hurdle

 

MCT Campus

The Pirates’ new manager, Clint Hurdle, won’t be afraid to argue with umpires — which is something that the previous manager

Lauren Kirschman
Staff Writer

 

The Pirates hired a new manager this
week, giving Clint Hurdle the opportu-
nity to turn around a franchise that just
ﬁnished its 18th—straight losing season.
Lucky guy.

Honestly, he can’t do much worse than
those who came before him.

The Pirates haven’t had a winning sea-
son since 1992, when they went 96-66 un-
derjim Leyland. Since then, ﬁve different
managers have taken the reigns, and ﬁve
different managers have failed.

The latest was John Russell, who ﬁn-
ished his three years with an overall record
of 186-299. He was a nice enough guy,
sure, but listen to Pittsburgh fans call into
radio shows and you’d hear exactly what
Pirates fans didn’t like about him —— be-

’ V sides the whole losing thing, of course.

Russell didn’t seem passionate
enough.
He hardly ever argued with umpires.

He conducted news conferences and in-
terviews in monotone; nobody could really
tell whether he was happy or angry. Not
that he really had that much to be happy
about, but still. Pittsburgh fans like their

‘coaches a little feisty, or they at least like

to know that the coaches care as much as
the fans do.

You wouldbe hard—pressed to find fans
anywhere in the country more passion-
ate than Pittsburgh fans. They love their
Steelers, their Penguins, their Panthers
and yes, even their Pirates. Pirates fans
need the manager to show that he wants
to resurrect the Pirates tradition as much
as they do.

Hurdle might be that manager.

He has no problem arguing with um-
pires as he was ejected 14 times over his
six years as the manager of the Colorado
Rockies, placing him in the top 10 in the
majors. At the very least, even if the team
on the ﬁeld isn’t entertaining, the manager
might be.

I mean, former Pirates manager Lloyd
McClendon didn’t win either, but he once

—John Russel, rarely did.

ripped out ﬁrst base and walked off the
ﬁeld with it after being ejected from a
"game. The Pirates ended up winning that
game, too. Now that’s entertainment.

But on a serious note, none of the game’s
best managers are going to take a job with
the league’s worst franchise. That’s just
how it is. The Pirates ﬁnished the season
57-105. How many people are going to get
excited about taking overthat?

Answer: not many. But Hurdle seems
excited. He claims he’s ready for the chal-
lenge and that he’s all in. At his news con-
ference, he was lively and engaging. Plus
he does have some experience leading a
winning team.

Hurdle was the manager for the Colora-
do Rockies from 2002-09 and ﬁnished his
tenure with a record of 534-625, including
a World Series appearance in 2007.

Now, 2007 was the only winning sea-
son that he compiled during his time with
the Rockies, but at least it was a winning
season. And none of the losing seasons

test for
Panthers

Roger Sepich
For The Pitt News

The Pitt women’s basketball team will
face its first serious challenge of the
season tonight. The Panthers will travel
to Minnesota to compete against the
Golden Gophers in the Super Six Se-
ries. .

The Panthers (1-0), coming off a
78-58 victory over Youngstown State
in their season opener last Friday, are
one of two Big East representatives —
the other being Notre Dame — in the
first edition of the competition, which
matches up teams from each of the coun-
try’s top six conferences.

“It’s a huge honor for us to represent

the Big East, and a win would signify a,
,win against a great‘ conference,” head

coach Agnus Berenato said.

The game is the firstof several tough
nonconference games the women will
play this winter with others including
Duke, Texas Tech and Duquesne.

“We really are going to be tested.
Seventeen of our 29 games are against
teams that played in the postseason last
year,” Berenato said. “I don’t know what
I was thinking, butl really believe in
order to be the best, you have to beat
the best.” A -

Senior guard Brittaney Thomassaid
that the tough early-season schedule
will only help the,Panthers in the long
run. '

“This Minnesota game is a big game
with a big crowd and good players,”
Thomas said. “It’1l help preparing us

_for the Big East for sure.”

The Minnesota Golden Gophers,
representing the Big Ten, enter the
showdown at 1-1 after being narrowly
upset by Wisconsin-Green Bay on Sun-
day afternoon, but Berenato says win-
ning at Minnesota is difficult for many
reasons. '

“I’ve coached there before, and the
court is raised about two feet, and it’s a
very different depth perception for the
team,” she said. “It’s just really awkward
and bizarre.”

Rough schedule for Pitt

Pitt faces 17 teams that played in the postseason last year

Women’s Basketball 4 8

The unique court isn’t the only thing
Pitt has to worry about. The Golden
Gophers have two guards, Kiara Buford

and Leah Cotton, who are averaging '

about 20 points per game eachgin their
first two contests, but the Panthers wel-
come the challenge. _

“We shouldn’t be scared,” Thomas
said. “Everybody has to put it on the
floor and play. Regardless of what they
have done, we have to come out ready
offensively and defensively, and we
should be okay.”

After three Wisconsin-— Green Bay for-
wards scored in double figures in the
surprising win over Minnesota, Pitt’s
frontcourt, led by seniors Chelsea Cole
and Shayla Scott, will look to have simi-

lar success. . "

“I’m thinking if we’re going to get the
win, Chelsea and our other forwards
have to have huge nights,” Berenato
said. “They have to have double—dou-
bles, and if they can, then we’ll be in
the game.” - V

No matter who’s on the floor, Ber-
enato believes playing strong defense

will be the key to coming away with a ‘

crucial early—season win. . 1

“It starts with your defense. It ends
with your defense,” she said. “You’re
always going to miss shots or not con-

. nect on a play, but if our defense can

spur our offense, that should help us
get some transition buckets and become

comfortable with our environment.”I 5

Big Hurdle for Pirates

New manager looks tobring first winning season since 1992

Kirschman 4 8

were as bad as 57-105.

He was ﬁred after the team got off to
an 18-28 start in 2008. Former Pirates
managerjim Tracy took over from there.

‘I know, small world.

This past season, Hurdle served as the
hitting coach for the Texas Rangers. The

Rangers led Major League Baseball with a

team batting average of .276; the Pirates

were 29th with an average of .242. Perhaps ‘

more importantly, Hurdle is known for his
work developing young players, and that’s
one thing the Pirates don’t lack.‘

In fact, one of the only reasons for opti-
mism around the Pirates stems from their
young core of Andrew McCutchen, Neil
Walker, Jose Tabata and Pedro Alvarez.

If the Piratesare going to be somewhat,

successful this season or in the near future,
Hurdle is going to have to help those play-
ers grow. Assembling a pitching staff that

./,2 f re e1

...rr.m)i -  

isn’t downright embarrassing would be a

good start as well.
I, for one, am on board with the hire.

I like it. Hurdle was the best the Pirates,‘

could do, and he at least deserves a chance.
The other choice was Jeff Banister, Rus-
sell’s bench coach who hasﬂbeen with the
Pirates for 25 years. C

Now, Pin sure Banister is a very nice
guy, but I’d rather have somebody new,
somebody from outside the Pirates or-
ganization +— somebody who might be

. willing to stand up and make a change in

Pittsburgh. 5
Hurdle went into hisinterview and
asked General Manager Neal'Huntington

 and President Frank Coonelly the tough

questions about their three—year plan,
their goals, their ﬂexibility. He challenged

them from the very beginning. That’s what '

I like to see.,[
