F PAUSE TO REMEMBER

Gwenn Barney
Staff Writer

Reverend John Wallace Jr. often
preaches to his Homewood con-
gregation at the Bible Center
Church of God in Christ about
issues pertaining to race. He has
also preached on topics ranging
from education and economics to
public health. ,
Wallace, a Pitt professor of so-
cial work, will share his insights
with a different crowd this Sat-
urday. He will lead one of the 20
sessions making up the Race in

America conference, which will
take place from Thursday, June 3,
to Sunday,]une 6, on Pitt’s campus.
The sessions cover seven areas:
families, youth and the elderly,
economics, education, criminal
justice, race relations, health and
mental health.

“Education is a core issue that
has to be addressed if we’re going

to rectify the problems that face 5

our nation,” Wallace said, adding
that he is going to use. Pittsburgh

Public Schools as an example dur— -

ing his speech. As a Homewood
native, Wallace feels that the con-

ference, billed on Pitt’s website as i

Pitt will host race equality conference

More than 40 of the country’s top race equality scholars will visit campus this week

“the most solution-focused con-
ference on race ever held,” can be
used as a vehicle to discuss issues
of race that speciﬁcally affect the
city.

“We have the ability to inﬂu-
ence change and make Pittsburgh
the most livable city for everyone,”
he said.

The major goal of the confer-
ence is for Pittsburghers and visi-
tors alike to share racial problems
they see in their individual neigh-
borhoods and work together to
ﬁnd solutions to those issues, said
Larry Davis, dean of Pitt’s School
of Social Work. Conference or-

ganizers feel that participants
in the event can then take home
with them the solutions pooled at
the conference and begin to put
these solutions into action to im-
prove conditions of racial disparity
across the nation. .

“Some people will say that the
problems aren’t solved by the end
of this conference,” Davis said. “But
this [the conference] will push the
envelope and lead us on the path
to greater racial parity.”

Apart from preaching, Wallace
has other experience in the ﬁeld of
racerelations. He helped conduct a

Schenley
may get
‘green’
restaurant

Michael Macagnone
Assistant News Editor

Plans to turn part of Schenley
Plaza into an Eat’n Park restau-
rant have taken a step forward.

The Pittsburgh Art Commis-
sion approved a conceptual plan
for the restaurant from the Eat’n
Park Hospitality Group in late
May, allowing the planning to
continue.

The commission, which tabled
the application in April, ap-
proved it after the group made
several changes to the restau-
rant’s plan.

The planned restaurant’s foot-

. print will be on the west side of
‘the plaza, on the patch of grass

across Schenley Drive from the
Hillman Library.

The restaurant, slated to open
next spring, will be different than
most of Eat’n Park’s 27 locations.
Though there will be both indoor
and outdoor seating areas, the

‘planners have reduced the build-

ing’s size to lessen “encroach-
ment on the main walkway”
according to the Eat’n Park Hos-
pitality Group’s application. '
In the application to the
Pittsburgh Art Commission, the
restaurant included a number
of “green measures,” including
minimizing the use of synthetic
materials in construction, out-
door and rooftop planting areas

City’s race relations stable

Race 4 1
2005 study which found that black, Hispanic

and American—Indian youth are more likely_ _

than white and Asian~American youth to be
sent to the principal’s office. The study also
found that they are two to ﬁve times more
likely to be suspended or expelled.

According to a 2007 study conducted
by Pitt's School of Social Work’s Center on
Racial and Social Problems, race relations
in the city of Pittsburgh are mostly healthy.
The study found that only 6 percent of blacks
and 4 percent of whites in Allegheny County
perceived race relations as an issue in their
neighborhood.

But the study revealed a different opinion
regarding police behavior. It found that 87
percent of blacks and 58 percent of whites
felt that, of all the racial groups in the city,
blacks are treated the worst by police.

The education gap in the city between
whites and minorities presented itself as
another local issue that will be addressed
at the conference. In Pittsburgh and many
other cities, a higher percentages of blacks
and Hispanics have less than a high school
degree than whites and Asians.

Wallace said these issues of racial dispar-
ity are rooted in larger economic issues that
persist in the city. The 2007 study reported
the median salary for a white household
in Pittsburgh to be about $32,692 — or

$10,000 more than the median salary for .

minority households.

 

“We’re not so unique as we think,” Davis
said of Pittsburgh’s* racial issues. “Many of

A the problems facing Pittsburgh are present

in cities across America.”

Davis is optimistic that more than 40 of
the nation’s top racial equality scholars are
ﬁnding their way to campus for the confer-
ence, put on by the Center on Racial and So-
cial Problems. In addition to the conference
sessions, activities include a panel discus-
sion and two keynote speeches. The keynote
speakers are former NAACP chairmanjulian
Bond and president of Bennett College in
Greensboro, N.C., Julianne Malveaux.

“To my knowledge, no one has ever tried
to pull this many solution-focused scholars
together,” Davis said.

Davis said that the conference is the
culmination of three years of planning. He
feels that Pitt is an ideal place to house the
conference because its role as a university
lends an air of neutrality and learning.

Nigel Smith, who graduated from the
School of Social Work injune, plans to par-
ticipate in the program as a recorder, taking
notes on conference sessions that may be
used in a future report by the Center on
Racial and Social Problems.

“I think my eyes are going to be opened
to a lot more,” he said. “I just think the op-
portunity to learn from an expert in the ﬁeld
is the opportunity to learn a lot.”

Play on gamers

The next time you’re ﬁnishing up — or fur-
ther delaying — your homework and need a
few minutes to relax, pick up the video game
controller, not the remote.

According to research presented at a

recent conference at New York University,

there are more beneﬁts to video games than
hours of button-mashing fun. Rather than
turning the brain to mush, some video games
actually stimulate brain activity and increase

I cognitive ability, peripheral vision, coordi-

nation and memory. It’s the fast—paced games
that typically show the latter beneﬁts, the
Associated Press reports. I

But college students who spend .more
time seated in front of the PlayStation than
the lecturing professor still shouldn’t be ap-

plauded. Even with the uptick in cognitive 4

abilities, video games are ﬁrst and foremost

Heavy

mindless entertainment, or perhaps now
better described as mostly mindless.

Even if they’re still played just for fun,
the claim that video games are a complete
waste of time loses some merit in light of
the current research. Then again, if students
trade studying or exercising for more hours
spent shooting up digital Nazis, the beneﬁt
is outweighed.

As long as students keep those video
game sessions from turning into marathons,
we can enjoy some beneﬁt while still having
fun. In the end we’re probably better of
reaching for a book than the controller, but
sometimes we all need to‘ veg out without
feeling guilty for wasting time.

doctors can

be taken lightly    

If your overweight doctor advises you to
lose weight, you might raise an eyebrow.

But should health care professionals
be expected to uphold the standards they
promote?

After all, doctors have a stressful oc-
cupation. They work long hours and don’t
necessarily have a lot of time to sleep, let
alone get to the gym or cook healthy meals.
It shouldn’t surprise us that some of them
take up smoking.’

But we’re not buying it.

Many other positions are just as stress-
ful. This is no excuse. ‘

Unhealthy behaviors don’t make indi-
viduals bad doctors, but there is the chance
that their patients won’t take them as seri-
ously. For example, why would a patient
trust the diet advice provided by an over-

weight nutritionist?

We can’t help but look at the individu-
als donning scrubs or white jackets smok-
ing outside UPMC and think that they’re
hypocrites. Smoking has negative health
consequences, and it’s not necessary to go
through medical school to ﬁgure that out.

Health care professionals’ body mass
index scores and unhealthy lifestyles don’t
take away from their talent or the fact that
they are serving in an admirable ﬁeld. But
they do hold a position that requires them
toieither practice what they preach or risk
not being taken seriously.

An out-of-shape personal trainer isn’t
desirable, and neither is an unhealthy doc-
tor.

MCI‘ CAMPUS

eep Europe ’ s
inﬂuence overseas

Mark Kozlowski
Columnist

To hear some of the talk on both sides of
the Atlantic, Europeans and Americans are
hardly the same species. We aren’t those

wimpy, cheese-eating surrender monkeys _

and they aren’t capitalistic, imperialistic
warmongers. Europe constantly gives us a
lot of crap about being loud, ugly Americans
with no class, and parties on both sides of the
ocean occasionally suggest that the United
States should aim to be just like Europe.

Now, I’m not a trained anthropologist, V

nor do I play one on TV. I only spent two
weeks in Europe, and a lot of that time was
spent trying not to trip over other tourists.
I don’t pretend to have knowledge of the
languages of the countries I visited, and of
course I.didn’t see everything. However, I

did’ take the best look I could manage. And
some of what I saw suggests that we should
be glad for what we have in this country
and avoid making generalizations about
our nation.

Europe hasa lot more history than we
can begin to fathom here. Siena, Italy, is a
town where the “new” construction dates
to the 1750s. However, this history is dotted
with reminders of serious internal strife.
You don’t utter the name “Medici” in Siena,
because thecity was conquered by the same
name in the 1550s. Carvings of the Venetian
lion in Verona —— itself a representation of a
past conquest — are thoroughly trashed and
vandalized not by hoodlums of the present
but by one hoodlum of the past: Napoleon.
The town hall of Bologna has the names of
partisans who fought the Fascists carved
in it, along with those who died in a Fascist
terror-bombing in Kozlowski > 6

a In Croatia, the strife is more recent and
obvious. The countryside is dotted with
houses that have caved—in roofs or houses

7 where only the outer wall remains standing,

likely the victims of shelling. Other build-
ings have large holes chipped in the facade
in random patterns, just the right size to
have been made by large-caliber. bullets. A
street in Zagreb is called “the Bloody Bridge,”
because before Yugoslavs of different ethnic
groups butchered each other, Yugoslavs of
the same ethnic group in the same city fought
in the streets. A

I Generally, we have avoided domes-

,,tic strife in our nation. /Sure, there was a

dreadful civil war, there have been large
riots, and we had disco inﬂicted upon us,
but these were remarkable occurrences. The
U.S. homeland has been spared war damage:
The last foreign power to destroy a city was
Great Britain_.jAnd the last city destroyed by
warfare was Richmond, Va., in 1865.

The Europeans also helped me appre-
ciate 'how good race relations are in the
United States. Go ahead, laugh all youiwant

I ~ latthis, obviously naive statement. But then
, consider thatone member ofxour glee club

was asked by an Italian, in all seriousness,
how we “blended the black and white forces
together” in our group. In Venice, we en-
countered giggling Slovenians trying to get
photographs of the two black members of
the glee club. Our tenors had a tour guide
who didn’t want to talk about or go inside
a synagogue’, despite our group showing
interest. Finally, consider former Yugoslavia
in general.

What I heard in Europe also made me
pause about some elements of common
knowledge. Take, for example, the notion
that Americans are overworked'— always

striving for who knows what, only caring
about money, they lead pointless, rat-race
lives. Europeans, on the other hand, are
carefree, relaxed and happy. Everybody
knows this.

Except the Polish engineer I talked to_in
Porec, Croatia. He and his wife had visited
Washington, and told me all about it in Pol-
ish — a language and culture I grew up with.
What they said was astonishing: They found
Americans very relaxed, always friendly,
always making wisecracks, always enjoying
themselves, while Europeans were tight-
lipped and striving frantically for unclear
objectives, not unlike the French Army in
World War I. Granted, perhaps if they had
visited New York City instead of Seattle, they
wouldn’t have the same story. However, this
showed me that some of the assumptions
we make about ourselves are not necessar-
ily true.

Oh yes. And though some American tour-
ists were obnoxious, some of the Germans I
saw were just as bad or worse.

Now, I don’t mean to sound anti—Europe.
I found the people of Italy and Croatia to be
genial and helpful to ignorant tourists like
myself. Europe has a lot we can learn from:
It was very pleasant to linger for two hours
over dinner, then go for a two—hour stroll
later. The cities are walkable. Zagreb’s public
transportation looked clean, extensive and
efficient in my limited experience. The art
and architecture of Italy live up to all its
hype. However, despite Europe being stun-
ning, we shouldn’t be so hasty to European-
ize this country.

Merrit Wuchina
Staﬁ‘ Writer

If “The Royal Tenenbaums” director
Wes Anderson ever made a reality show,
it would look like the Waffle Shop. The
word “Waffles” is lit up by round, yellow
bulbs, shimmering behind a clean, wooden
counter aligned with red bar stools.°In the

. back is a small, but glamorous stage, com-

plete with curvy orange chairs and a talk
show desk, almost like Conan 0’Brien’s
old one.

The menu has four simple wafﬂe styles

that are all less than $6.50: the classic, .

choco, omelet and savory. We decided to
save the bananas foster — bananas, va-
nilla ice cream and brown sugar — for.
dessert. The menu also included add-ons
like whipped cream and strawberries for
extra cash. . .

The Waffle Shop started out as a class
at Carnegie Mellon University called the
Storefront Project and led by professor
Jon Rubin. Rather than sit and paint on
canvases in a dank basement, art students
at Carnegie Mellon had the opportunity to
create a work of art at an abandoned store-
front. Over the past three years, projects
like these have-popped up in the South
Side and Garﬁeld, but since 2008, the
Wafﬂe Shop has been the most successful
shop thus far. ‘

Marci Calabretta,-ajunior at Carnegie"

Mellon, waitresses for her work-study job
at the Waffle Shop every Friday along with

' six other students who work as cooks or

hosts in the shop. Even though she isn’t an
art student herself, she knew something
about the goalsof the artists.

“Their idea was whatever they’re in-
spired by, they must create a workof art
and then leave it wherever they found the
inspiration  the people in Pittsburgh
were the inspiration for this, just pass-
ersby. That’s why we have the talk show
— people on the street, our customers or
people from the Shadow Lounge next door
are our creative subjects,” she said, refer-
ring to one of the store’s pet projects.

The students surveyed the area and,
noticing a lack of breakfast establish-
ments, decided a waffle restaurant would
be the best way to draw in the community.
Since the shop is only open during odd
hours of the weekend, customers range
from hungry bar hoppers leaving the Shad-
ow Lounge at 2 a.m. to families looking for
a nice meal after church.

Occasionally, the shop is rented out
to local musicians and performers, and
every Sunday at 10 a.m. chef Tom Totin
gives cooking lessons.

Customers who enter the shop not

The Waffle Shop brings a whole new meaning to late—night talk shows.

only have the opportunity to dine but also
to participate in their own TV talk show,
which is produced every day the shop is
open. The stage is equipped with a cam-
corder, microphones and a computer, al-
lowing each “episode” to be broadcast on
the Waffle Shop’s website. Fans at home
can even talk to customers on the talk
show through Skype and instant mes-
senger.

Calabretta has experienced some pret-
ty strange moments at the shop, including
a lightsaber battle between customers
trying to re—enact the “Star Wars” saga
on stage. V

‘ The shop rents the space from the
Shadow Lounge owners and operates
through grant funding and wafﬂe sales
revenue. It was created by a class budget
and money from students themselves.

Dawn Weleski was a former student
ofjon Rubin and now works as the shop’s
assistant director. She sees the shop as
an interdisciplinary space for students
of all majors to work creatively with the
community.

“The one rule is engage the commu-
nity that walks in the door,” she said. “An
unsuspecting waffle patron is a potential
participant for someone’s creative proj-
ect.”

The shop is planning on expanding
next door with the addition of Conﬂict
Kitchen, an Iranian takeout storefront that
will sell food from whatever country the
United States “is at odds with” at the time.
The food will be wrapped in paper printed
with cultural and political information on
the country provided by foreign journal-
ists and Pittsburgh citizens and compiled
by a work-study research writer.

“The idea is to spread to word to
the local community and get them up to
speed,” Calabretta said. “Like someone
who wouldn’t normally pick up a news-
paper.” ‘

But before we left, Weleski pointed out
the shop’s most recent addition, a public
storytelling billboard.

Above the building rested a large sign
with black—and-white block letters that
read: “People think I’m’a ghost. I don’t
know. It’s really hard to tell. I’m kind of
like a ghost, and I might be invisible.”

It’s a quote from one of the talk shows
at the shop, and the space will continue to
feature stories from the local and global
community through the year.

‘Pitt relay team disqualiﬁed

Tonyjovenitti
Assistant Sports Editor

The Pitt women’s relay team qual-
ified for the national champion-
ship on Saturday. Ten minutes
later, it was already eliminated.
The 4x100—meter relay team
posted a personal best time of

'44.47 seconds at the NCAA East-

ern preliminary round and ﬁn-
ished second in its heat.

The top three teams in each
heat automatically qualify for
the NCAA Championship, but
rgfﬁcials ruled that there was a
lane violation, and Pitt’s team,
consisting of Ashley Woodford,

Da’Lynn Mills, Jonnique Law-
rence and Cambrya Jones, was
disqualiﬁed.

“We were kind of disappoint-
ed,” head coach Alonzo Webb
said. “The girls were so excited
after they ﬁnished.”

But Webb pointed out a silver
lining in the disqualiﬁcation.

“All four girls are returning
next year, and they now know
they can compete with the best
in the country,” he said.

That ﬁnish would have put
the relay team into 11th place in
the nation. Pitt even defeated Big
East champion Connecticut — a

team to which they had lost twice
this season.

Jermaine Lowery also came
close to qualifying for the na-
tional championship, which will
be held in Eugene, Ore., next
weekend. He ﬁnished 14th in the
400—meter hurdles. The top 12
runners qualify.

“Lowery came up a little
short,” Webb said. “But he
would’ve needed a very strong
personal best to qualify.”

Lowery ﬁnished almost a full
second behindthe 12th—place
runner.

No NCAA
Tournament
for Panthers

Alex Oltmanns
Sports Editor

The Pitt baseball team had a
chance to succeed in both the
conference and national tourna-
ments, but after losing its ﬁnal
series and disappointing in the
conference tournament, the Pan-
thers’ season came to premature
end.

During the Big East tourna-
ment in Clearwater, Fla., last
week, No. 3 seed Pitt lost two of
three games. Their only win was
against seventh—seeded Cincin-
nati. That led the Panthers to end
the season by losing ﬁve of seven
games, a stretch that put them on
the NCAA Tournament bubble.

That bubble burst when the
ﬁeld of 64 was announced Mon-
day.

.“I am disappointed that we
did not get a bid,” head coach
Joejordano said. “I feel strongly
we areone of the best 64 in the
country. Unfortunately, it is what
it is, and we have to accept it and
move on.”

Pitt started the postseason

slowly with a 9-5 loss to No. 6 seed ’_

Rutgers in the ﬁrst game.

The Scarlet Knights jumped
to a 9-0 lead after two innings,
but the Panthers kept ace pitcher
Corey Baker in the game, and he
didn’t allow another run in four
more innings of work.

Led by Kevan Smith’s 3 for 4

performance behind the plate, the '

Pitt bats came alive to cut the lead
to four at 9-5, but the Panthers
couldn’t get any closer.

“Being down 9-0 after the ﬁrst
two innings is difﬁcult to over-
come,” Jordano said. “However,
we continued to battle hard, and
we scored ﬁve making the game
manageable. We just didn’t have
enough to come all the way
back.”

But the Panthers bounced
back in the next game, defeating
Cincinnati 13-4 to avoid elimina-

tion.

Smith continued his stellar
play, going 4 for 4 withtwo RBIs,
whereas Philip Konieczny went
3 for 4. ‘

Meanwhile, pitcher Matt Ian-
nazzo allowed four runs on 13 hits
in seven and two-thirds innings to
get his 11th win of the season.

The win set up a game against
Connecticut, but the Panthers
weren’t able to avoid elimination
for a second straight’ day, losing
7-2.

Catcher Cory Brownsten went
1 for 3 in the game, hitting the
team’s only home run ofthe tour-
nament. ‘

Brownsten and Smith earned A

spots on the All-Tournament
team with their impressive per-
formances. - ~
“Cory and Kevan had an out-
standing tournament,” Jordano
said. “Both deserved the recogni-

- tion they received.”

Traveling back to Pittsburgh,
the Panthers’ fate for the rest of
the postseason was in the hands
of the selection committee.

But the committee did not ex-
tend a bid to them, denying the
Big East of having four teams in
the NCAA Tournament.

St. John’s got an automatic bid
after winning the conference tour-
nament as the No. 4 seed, whereas
Connecticut and Louisville made
it as at-large selections. The Pan-
thers were a combined 6-2 against
those teams this season.

Despite the disappointing end
to the season, it was still a monu-
mental year for the team.

It led the nation in team bat-
ting average (.363) and had the
most Big East wins in school his-
tory with 18.

After achieving such a high
level of success this year, Jordano
said the team will certainly want
even more next season.

“We will begin work immedi-
ately to be in contention again
next season,” Jordano said.

the Eastern preliminary in Greensboro,
N .C., over the weekend, but none qualiﬁed
for the national championship. This was
the first year of the new format. Insteadof

. four regional qualifying meets, there were

only two preliminary rounds.
Webb is now looking forward to next
season."

’ “This was a young team overall on both
the men’s and women’s side,” he said. f‘Next
year is going to be much better.” '

He said the men’s team has talent that
is already here and ready to develop, and
the women’s team has several top recruits
on deck.

Ashley Corum, from Carlisle, is a three- ~

time Pennsylvania state champion in the

«-

triple jump and was ranked No.7 in the
country as of last week.

"Jordan Lee from Penn Hills recently
took second place in the 400 at the Penn-
sylvania Interscholastic Athletic Asso-
ciation Championships (PIAA), and her
4x400-meter relay team finished first.

Julia Koloski from Montrose, Pa., is also
a state champion in the triple jump.

“She should help right away in the
jumps,” Webb said.

Webb pointed out how this year, and es-
pecially last weekend’s meet, was a learn-
ing experience for most of the team.

“Next year will be better,” he said.
