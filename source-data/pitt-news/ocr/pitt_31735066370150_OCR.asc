Olson To Leave
Post In January

By PEGGY FERRI

Pitt medical school dean Donald
Leon‘s decision to relieve» Dr.
Robert Olson, assistant dean for
academic affairs, of all admin-
istrative duties will take effect in
January.

Leon had demanded Olson's
resignation on Oct. 28 after citing
“academic incompatibility and a dif-
ference in management philo-
sophy.” Olson will continue as a pro-
fessor in the medical school, but
because he will turn 65 at the begin-

, ning 01 [I16 year, HIS adI‘n1I'l1SU'a[lVC

duties will" end.

Some medical school faculty and‘

students have said that the reasons
for the actions are not clear. Olson
confirmed Leon’s decision to relieve
him of his duties and said various
opinions have circulated in the
school. He would only say, “The
administration is on a new course.”

Olson said two weeks ago that the
fundamental reason behind Leonls
demand for resignation concerned
his (Olson's) belief that there has"
been .a change in the university’s
emphasis away from the basic
sciences. _

“ My impression is that there will
be a slowing of the basic sciences’

revitalization’ and that funds ear- I A

marked for the basic sciences may be

directed into other areas,” Olson, _

said.

He added that if funds are redi-
rected into other scientific areas and
their teaching, it would mean
weaker basic science departments. .

“My position is that you should_
strengthen the disciplinary base
[basic sciences] first," Olson
explained.

Olson was appointed to revitalize
the basic sciences ' departments,
which include biochemistry, micro-
biology, cell biology, anatomy and
pharmacology. The departments

Assembly Accepts Bargaining
Resolution,Posvar Disapproves

By DIANE LEi=l<owIrz

The Faculty Assembly voted 24 to
l6 yesterday to accept a resolution
supporting an election for collective
[bargaining despite indications by
Chancellor Wesley Posvar that he is
opposed to the move. ,

The resolution, which was pre-
sented by professor Jack Matthews
of the communications department,
states that “themost direct, expedi-
tious and economical route to an
election is for the administration
and trustees to agree to join with the
faculty organization in requesting
the Pennsylvania Labor Relations
Board to hold a consent election.”

The resolution recommends a
joint effort between the administra-
tion, trustees and United Faculty for
a collective bargaining election in
the provost’s area bargaining unit of
Pitt.

In a letter, dated Nov. 22, to Uni-
ted Faculty president Philip Wion,
Posvar said it “was not in the best
interests of the university” tojoin in
a unionization attempt by the
faculty.

 

Although the resolutinn.,¢§,plicitly

cooperative approach to the request

vertently mean they were in favor of

professm";I’ohri Arrnstrotrg. “A yes
vote or a no vote will be construed as
taking a stand for or against the Uni-
ted Faculty." _

Other Faculty Assembly members
said a vote for the resolution didn’t
indicate a step toward the imple-
mentation of collective bargaining.

“If people want to read their own
implications into it, that’s up to
them,” public and international
affairs instructor Saul Katz said.

. In a letter by Dr. Barbara Shore,
an assembly member who could not
attend the meeting, she said every
faculty member has the right to
choose whether‘he wants collective
bargaining or not.

“[This is] not a vote for or against
collective bargaining," she said.

“This motion’s simply a motion

by which, if we support it, we sup-

port the right of faculty to go on
record to vote whether or not they
want to go for collective bargain-
ing,” English professor Edwin
Ochester said. “We ought not to
judge since we are representing our
colleagues and have not polled
them,” he said.

Students Seek G

By DEBORA GOSSETT

Three students will depart today
to try their luck in California. They_
will be appearing soon on the net-
show “Wheel of
Fortune.” A A

Pitt Program council sponsored
and selected winners to participate
in a special “College Week” segment
of the show which will be taped at
NBC Studios in Burbank, Califor-
nia. The three students selected to
represent Pitt are K..I. Jones, Maria
Jaeger, and Rich Rosenbaum. The
winners were selected from over 200
students who tried out. The selection
process consisted of an application,
tests for puzzle solving, personal
interviews, a simulated game and

A former Westinghouse Elec-
tric Corp. computer scientist has
been named associate senior vice
chancellor for computing and
telecommunications.

David Forejt (pronounced,
for-RICK) began his official
duties yesterday in the newly
created position. He will report
to senior vice chancellor Jack
Freeman. Forejt’s duties will
involve planning and coordinat-
ing the university’s computer
policies and programs.

The Pitt graduate had worked
for Westinghouse Electric Corp.
since 1957 and most recently
served as manager of computing
and network services for-the cor-
poration’s research and develop-
ment center. The department,
which had been working on long-
range plans~for Westinghouse's
business computing and office
automation, worked with a
budget of $5 million and a staff
of 20 people. .

Vice-Chancellor For
Pitt Computing Named

Forejt said he will begin work
here to create maximum ﬂexi-
bility in terminal-to-‘computer
and computer-to-computer com-
munications. Forejt added that
computer-to-computer com-
munication could involve linking
Pitt’s system to computers at
other schools or industries.

Forejt also discussed interuni-
versity teleconferencing, the cap-
ability of conducting lectures,
interviews or debates with other
universities across the country
,without having participants
leave thier respective schools.

Among his other duties, Forejt
will be involved in data transmis-
sion, telephone systems and a
new electronic security system.

Having just started work yes-
terday, Forejt said he still has to
discover just What he can do for
the university in addition to
increasing the system‘s effi-
ciency, but added that increasing
student accessibility [to compu-
ter terminals] would be a natural
result of increasing computer
ability.” ,

along with an alternate.

One representative, Rich Rosen-
baum said, “I’m very excited about
the trip. I expect to have a good
time." Another contestant, Maria
Jaeger, said, “I expect to get a
glimpse of the T.V. world and to
have fun.” The other representative,
KJ. Jones, was not available for
comment. ‘is

Vickie Grave was also selected to
represent Pitt, but was not able to go
on the trip because of financial diffi-
culties. She said, “The people from
the “Wheel” of Fortune”show should
have paid for the expenses, they [the
show] asked the students to
participate.”

According to Rich Rosenbaum,
“Regulations of the show stated that
students who participate in the show
have to pay for their own expenses.“
Costs for the trip include $400 air
fare, plus hotel and board expense.

ame-Show Fortunes

Other schools that are participat-
ing during the “College Week” seg-
ment are UCLA. the University of
Alabama and Notre Dame. The uni-
versities selected were asked to par-
ticipate because of the popularity of
the schools’ football teams.

During the “College Week” seg-
ment, three students from each
school will play in one game, ensur-
ing that all students participating get
to play. The three highest prize win-
ning schools will play a champion-
ship round. In this particular round,‘
the winner from each school will
play in the championship round if he
or she is the top money winner from
his or her respective school. The
winning school's proceeds will be
divided among its members. The
shows will be taped at a yet unan-
nounced date.

Opinion

Here W_e
Go Again

Wednesday night President Reagan vetoed legisla-
tion which required El Salvador to report on its “pro-
gress” in human rights in order to recieve further
United States aid. I

Reagan has to show Congress every six months that
ﬂagrant human rights violations are not being com-
mitted by the El Salvadoran government in order for
them to receive continued aid. I

Congress, however, has not been in session for over
two weeks, thereby allowing Reagan to sneak past this
legislation using the pocket veto. Reagan’s veto would
have been met with ﬁerce Senate oppostion if it had
been done at any other time.

Since taking office, Reagan has increased U.S.
funding to El Salvador from $125 million annually to
over $325 million. This represents virtually 25 percent
of the total budget of the Central American country.

Reagan, after having such a sizable investment in his
private South American army, is certainly not going to
allow a bunch of bleeding heart, human-rights-minded
liberal Democrats to jeopardize his war machine.

Reagan has used this tiny dictatorship to wage war
on the Sandinistas in Nicaragua. Aiding a country that
kills Americans to wage war against one that doesn’t is
just usual politics for the Reagan White House.

Word coming out of El Salvador is that the right-
wing junta has not curtailed human rights violations
and indeed has refused to prosecute the known
National Guardsmen who executed the three Ameri-
can nuns in 1981.

Press secretary Larry Speakes said Thursday that
reports‘ from El Salvador attempting to deny human
rights violations in therface of news reports to the
contrary made it difficult or cumbersome to justify
‘continuation of U.S. aid. Obviously to make things
easier all around, the Reagan Administration chose to

remove the need to attempt such embarrassing denials .

by El Salvador.

Time after time Reagan has shown the American

public his disdain and lack of responsibilty towards
human rights. His veto of this legislation is just
another example of his deftness at political manipula-
tions so as to hoodwink the American public.

So call out the death squads, shoot some more
peasant villagers and string up a few more nuns; Presi-
dent Reagan’s done it.

Holiday Though

By J.P. MARRA

I hope to leave you all with a
few thoughts to ponder during
the holiday break, which will
find me doing much less thinking
than sleeping. To wit:

0This week, NBC will break
my heart by killing NBC News
“Overnight,” and with it, Linda
Ellerbee. If any of you have seen
her read the news, you know how
I feel. She is one of the few news-
casters who approach the news
as it should be approached —
with tongue thrust firmly in
cheek. She has been witty, ironic
and a bit sarcastic, and now we’re
stuck with Connie Chung, who is
a wonderful person, I’m sure, but
who acts as if she actually
believes the garbage she feeds us.
Ah, well. That’s the ratings
game.

CD0 not be surprised if Terry
Bradshaw returns very soon t.o
the Steeler lineup. Be surprised,
however, if he does much better
than Cliff Stoudt before him.
Brad has two big factors working
against him — rust and a bat-
tered offensive line in front of
him that bears little resemblance
to the one which afforded him a
respectable running game and a

_ pocket from which to throw in
. years past.

01 would have sooner pledged
my first-born child at a Black
Mass sacrifice than attended the
AC/DC concert Wednesday
night. And I’m not sure ifthere is
so much difference between the
two acts.

0There are right ways and
wrong ways for labor to handle
contract disputes. Throwing
rocks, eggs and punches at inno-
cents is a wrong way, for
instance. Striking Greyhound
workers have chosen this way.
Admittedly, their options are
rather limited at this point, but

The -Pitt News encourages
and accepts column submis-
sions from interested faculty,
students and staff. All sub-
missions should be typed and
double-spaced_ on non-
erasable paper. The subject
matter is left to the discretion
of the author. All submis
sions should be addressed to
The Pitt News, 441 William
Pitt Union and should include
the writer's name, phone
number and university
affiliation.

this gives them no blank check to
be drawn against the Bank of
Violence. Better that they would
have been as creative in their
means of protest (and less de-
structive as well) as Pennsylva-
nia’s State Police have been.

ts At Lar

 

Miffed at a legislature that
first turned down a pay hike
request by the troopers, then, in
the same week, voted itselfa rela-
tively huge increase in salary, the
police simply stopped writing ci-
tations. And rest assured that the
revenues that they are no longer
generating will carry a big stick
all by themselves.

0Have you caught the latest
craze? Thousands of housewives
and fathers are lining up at
department stores all over the
area to swing punches at each
other in an attempt to plunk
down a couple of IO spots in

e -

exchange for an adoption certifi-
cate, a birth certificate and a doll

that looks suspiciously like Fan- “

nie Purina, the girl we used to
tease back in second grade
because God forgot to-give her a
chin and put her eyes too close
together.

I assume that these Cabbage
Patch Kids are Christmas pres-
ents for these people’s children.
If so, kids are getting lots more
powerful these days. If my little
sister were to have asked my
mom, I0 years ago, to stand in
line for a couple of hours at the
‘crack of dawn, beat up a couple
dozen people and pay 20 bucks
for one of these creatures, Mom
would have told her to take a
long stroll.

0Joan Rivers understands the
concept of “crotch humor" better
than any female comedienne I
have yet seen. I am guessing that
her recent success canjbe traced
directly to this fact.

0A local bowl party this holi-
day season —— Pitt, Penn State
and West Virginia — might well
be your best bet this Christmas.

Oln the mad rush to chop
down Ronald Reagan in lieu of

the Grenada invasion, the sty-
mied arms talks and his inability
to reduce the national debt, it
seems everyone has missed an
amazing observation. Did you
realize that when Reagan
appears to speak, Nancy, an
accomplished ventriloquist, is
actually doing the talking? its
true. _

When he talks (or appears to be
talking), Nancy never moves her
lips. And, if you’ve watched the
two of them closely, you’ve seen
the giveaway —- Ron never talks
when Nancy is drinking a glass of
water.

Good luck on finals, all. And
have a happy, restful safe
holiday.

Lacking Precise Criteria‘

For Real World Concepts  

Dear Editor:

In his letter “When is a Person a
Person?" Joseph Armata rightly
notes “there is no objective way to
decide" among various standards of
personhood. This, he says, helps
explain why personhood is con-
ferred (a) at an undefined time, (b)
by undefined judges, (c),who lack
precise, objective criteria. He sees
this situation as a problem — which
it is — but fails to appreciate that it is
inevitable.

The sad truth is that we lack pre-
cise criteria for most concepts in the
real world. Leaving’ aside the emo-
tional issue of personhood, I defy
Mr. Armata to supply precise crite-
ria even for, say, “chairhood."
Unlike in mathematics, where defi-
nitions are strictly stipulated in nat-
ural languages, definitions are
conventions. We share an idea of
what a, concept includes even though
we lack precise inclusion criteria.
We all agree certain objects count as
chairs and certain ones do not, just
as we all agree about clear cases of
persons(e.g., Mr. Armata) and non-
persons (e.g., Lassie). The fighting
starts with borderline cases: Is a
“beanbag chair” or a hammock a
chair? Is Baby Doe a person? (Actu-
ally, “personhood" and “right to
life" do not exactly overlap: Con-
demned murderers are clearly per-
sons who, some feel, have lost their
right to live. The real question is not
personhood, but the right to have
one’s life respected.)

These borderline cases in no way
invalidate “chairhood” or “person-
hood.” We can still tell black from
white in spite of the many shades of
gray that bridge them. But border-

line cases do account for why the _

world is such a fascinating place in
which to live: Reasonable people

can disagree. You and I can look at.

Baby Doe and come to different
conclusions —— and we may be
equally right, thanks to the inherent
imprecision (or flexiblility) in our
shared notion of personhood.

Mr. Armavta‘s true fear is the
“slippery slope," the phobia that if
we allow reasonable decision-
making to happen now, we will slide
into committing atrocities soon
enough. History suggests, however,
that public opinion tends to oscillate
‘instead of slide and that we more
accurately stand atop a “slippery
mountain,” with an equal potential
to slide too far down the opposite
slope as well. ' '

Mr. Armata‘s recommendation,
to stipulate moments of conception
and death as endpoints of person-
hood, is no solution. By his own ear-
lier admission, “there is no objective
way to decide” on this standard over
others. He proposes it merely to
sidestep\debate, a wish both naive
and hopeless. Hospitalethics boards

in contrast, recognize the complex— _

ity of the real world, and, facing di-
lemmas with pain and loss either
way, feel out a group of relatively
diverse, interested, informed repre-
sentatives of our larger society to
arrive at a consensus in a particular
case, Our jury system works sim-
ilarly. Neither system is infallible,
for neither ever “conslusively
proves” anything in a strict sense,
but they are the best we have. I, for
one, am glad we decide such grave
‘issues by this messy route and avoid
arbitrary stipulations that look
simpler. Dogmatism always appears
simple, but simplicity is mo guaran-
tee of validity. 1

The Pitt News, Friday, December 2, 1983

Jeff Yoffe:

Part Of Winning Team

Pitt junior Jeff Yoffe doesn’t
know if he wants to be a doctor
or lawyer, but he could be setting
himself up to be a star liver trans-
plant surgeon.

Yoffe, who recently turned 20,
is the only undergraduate
member of the noted Presbyter-
ian University Hospital’s liver
transplant team.

He assists the anesthesiologist
during transplant operations and
measures blood clotting during
surgery on a thrombolastograph
machine. He watches out for
Iysis, the unclotting of blood,
which is abnormal during
operations. .

“That’s the main problem with
liver transplant operations,"
Yoffe said.

His interest in transplants

- began last March when he did

volunteer work for Dr. Achiel
Bleyaert, who was affiliated with

» the Eye and Ear Hospital. When

Bleyaert left to become chief
anesthesiologist at Presbyterian,
Yoffe went with him.

Yoffe carries around a beeper
at all times and will get a call two
or three hours in advance when a
liver transplant is to be per-
formed. This occurs about twice
a week, and surgery lasts any-
where from I2 to 24 hours.

His duties also include prepar-
ing test tubes and stamping
forms for blood identification.

“When things get slower, I can
usually manage to take 20 min-
utes to get a snack,” Yoffe said.

Not only does he get beeped
for liver transplant operations,
but he is frequently called when
data from the operations is being
processed.

“I keep in -eonstant contact _

with the lab who is analyzing my
data," he said.

The time he puts into his job
doesn’t stop there. He said he has
to keep up on his reading about
liver transplants and anesthesiol-
ogy to do an efficient job.

Despite all of the time he puts
into his work with the livertrans-
plants, Yoffe said he isn't a bor-
ing person.

“I feel I’m diverse,” he said.
“The idea with a lot of pre-meds
and pre-laws is they’re geared
toward on thing. I’m not like
that.

“I don’t use work as an excuse
not to do things. When people
have jobs, that’s often just a
lousy excuse they have. Anyone
can manage their time if they
want to.”

Between his work, for which
he earns six credits, and two

classes, Yoffe‘s free time is pre-
cious, and he likes to spend it
shooting pool in the Student
Union or talking with friends.
Sleeping time is also precious.

“I’ve conditioned myself on
really being able to live on four
hours [of sleep] a night,” he said.
“I’m not one of those who needs
a lot of sleep. I guess I’m lucky —
in a lot of ways.”

Internships: More Than A Name On Your Resume

By PAT GUARDINO

With the status of the Internship
Office making headlines, a lot of stu-
dents are becoming interested in
internships and asking what they are
and why having one looks good on

ne’s resume.

An internship is basically a work
experience in a professional field
designed to emphasize learning.
According to Debbie Tomasura,
graduate assistant at the Internship
Office, students intern “for the expe-
rience,—not the job.”

Each term, approximately 100
students register for internships.
Others use the office as a resource
center to get ideas for internships
before searching for them on their
own.

Those who cannot find an intern-
ship best suited to their major can
develop a self-designed internship in
fields such as law and architecture.

Finding an internship from
among the many offered through the
Internship Office is easy if you know
what you are looking for, but it can
be somewhat frustrating if you are
not so sure.

For some students, it takes several
trips to the office, looking through
books before deciding on ‘a particu-
lar internship. For others, it almost
falls into their laps.

S “I was in the right place at the
right time,” junior Kurt Wein-
schenker said. He accidentally ran
into a producer for WPXI-TV while
on assignment for The Pitt News
and landed an internship with the
station.

Recent graduate Flo Kerr went to
the internship office with the inten-
tion of looking through the books,
but she saw a sign posted on the door
for a graphic artist at the Aquazoo,
part of the Pittsburgh Zoo. She
called the zoo and got the internship.

In some cases, it can be relatively
easy to get the internship of your
choice. The Internship Office
requires students to have at least 55
credits (junior status) and to have
taken two courses in their major.

Most companies have certain
requirements for interns; usually the
student must be a junior or senior,
although some, like Mellon Bank,
require that a student be a senior or
MBA candidate.

Other employers would like stu-
dents to have some previous expe-
rience. Nancy Brem, public relations

Employers also feel it is very
important for students to have
internships because it puts them in
contact with the working world and
gives them the chance to learn from
their mistakes._

Kim Bergman, human resources
coordinator at KDKA, said, “We try

formance is not good and then try to

“I learned mostly organizational
skills dealing with working in
groups, which helped me work with
meetings in the student govern-
ment,” he said.

Senior Marianne Barkus,
interned at the Allegheny County
Department of Development, said
“Working with different supervisors
gave me more confidence in han-
dling myself. Now I can handle
myself better in an interview
situation.”

Having an internship also gives
students an advantage when job
hunting because many companies
will hire people who have interned
with them or who have had intern-
ship experience.

According to Ralph Brem, asso-
ciate editor of The Pittsburgh Press,
25 percent of The Press staff are
former interns.

“If we’re impressed with [the
interns'] workmanship, they have a
good chance of getting in,” Barbara
Hudson of Mellon Bank said.

Students who look elsewhere for
jobs have an edge over those who
have never interned anywhere. Tim
Bamford, manager of personnel and
labor relations at Rockwell, said

' that besides grades, there is no other

way to know which person would be
best for the job.

Married Women Expanding Nation’s Workforce

By DEBORAH NICHOLS

The changes that have affected
women's work and family life during
this century may be a springboard
for even more dramatic changes in
women’s politics before the century
is out, according to Dr. Maurine
Greenwald, associate history profes-
sor at Pitt.

Greenwald spoke Iuesday night
at the Oakland Women’s Center in a
speech entitled “The Demographic
Revolution in Women’s Work and
Family Life.”

Married women have played a
steadily increasing role in the Ameri-
can workplace in the 20th century,
said Greenwald, an American social
historian.

Greenwald said there have been
four developments that have con-
tributed to this trend. First, the
decline early in the century of the
child labor force, due both to com-
pulsory education laws and to the

, prohibition of child labor. Mothers

went to work to replace the contri-
bution that children had once made
to their families’ incomes and indus-
tries accepted them as low-paid
replacements for cheap child labor,
she said.

Secondly, the rise ofthe consumer
society, beginning in the l920’s

Pitt Army HO TC
HOSTS Annual
Dining In

The University of Pittsburgh
Army ROTC will host its annual
Dining In at 6:45 p.m. on Friday,
Dec. 2, at the Parkway Center
Terrace in Greentree.

Don Bailey, former U.S. Con-
gressman from Pennsylvania
and military veteran, will be the
guest speaker. The evening will
also include a cadet and cadre
roast and the traditional Grog
Bowl Ceremony. The Grog Bowl
Ceremony is the one chance dur-
ing the year that the cadets and
cadre can toast each others’
achievements and mishaps injest
by officially recognizing them
and “sending them to the grog.”

The Dining In is an annual
event sponsored by the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh Senior ROTC
Instructor Group for its cadre
and cadets. This is a military tra-
dition of the Britain Officers
Mess dating back to the l8th'
century.

increased the amount of money fam-
ilies wanted to have to spend. Mass
production of automobiles and tract
homes, as well as electric appliances
and other goods, were combined
with installment buying, and what
Greenwald described as a widely
advertised “new American standard
of living" came within reach of the
middle class.

The decline in the birth rate was
also a factor in women’s movement
into the workplace. A rise in birth
control availability made it easier
for families to control their family
size. Limitation of the family size
was used as a means to achieve a
higher standard of living.

Finally, Greenwald attributed
women’s own personal aspirations
as playing a part in this increase.
Women’s desire to work increased
regardless of outside economic pre-
sure, and this was expressed in pop-
ular magazine articles from the
19205 onward.

While the number of working
women was increasing, Greenwald
said, the American labor force as a
whole was ~also changing. The
number of agriculture workers, for
example, was declining while white
collar work was on the upswing.

“The patterns of women’s work
have mirrored, in a more accentu-

ated way than men’s, the path of the
ecomony as awhole," she said.

By 1940, farm labor had disap-
peared from the 10 leading occupa-

Maurine Greenwald

tions of women, while over the
course of three decades beginning in
the 1920s , office work, such as cleri-
cal and secretarial, rose to the top
position — a position it has held
since I950.

In spite of these changes, Green-

! conveniently absent

J

wald said, certain characteristics of
women’s work have persisted. For
example, there are a limited number
of occupations in which women con-
centrate their efforts. Greenwald
called this “gender segregation"and
said two theories have emerged to
explain it.

The human capital approach
asserts that women choose occupa-
tions with lower skill and responsi-
bility levels in order to more
themselves
from the labor force for periods of
time. Also, women do notsee their
education, on-the-job training, or
work commitment as an investment,
according to this theory.

A contrasting view is called the
discrimination theory of employer
choice. Greenwald said this theory
holds that women are discouraged
from participating in workplaces
and professions that have built-up
traditions of male domination. In
Greenwaldsopinion, some combi-
nation of these two theories is at
work.-

“Women are entering tradition-
ally male professions directly as an
effect of the women’s liberation and
affirmative action programs," she
said.

Significant advances have
occurred in law, academia and sci-

ences and medicine since the l960s.
Gender segregation, however, does
still exist. she said

In spite of equal pay laws passed
in the ’60s — laws which protect the
interest of both men and women
working in any given occupation -

there was no increase in women's
acceptance into many traditional
male work places, Greenwald said.
' Realization by women ofthis res-
istance to change in overall ocupa-
tion patterns explains a significant
shigt in political strategy, Greenwald
sai .

Having achieved equal pay for
equal work, feminist are now asking
to determine, through detailed job
analysis, where equal pay for work
of comparable worth should be
instituted. Success in these measures
could lead to a “revolution in
women’s pay scales,” she said.

These and other politically impor-
tant issues appear to be creating a
new political consciousness and
independence on the.part of women
voters, Greewald said. She said she
thinks that the determined entry of
women into American politics in
this decade is a “tremendously excit-
ing development” — one which

could profoundly influence future

social demographic trends Of
women.

Survival

of the

, fittest

By JONATHAN KUNKEL

The Pittsburgh Laboratory Thea-
tre's current production of A Lesson
From /iloes by Athol Fugard definitly
leaves one speechless and with mixed
emotions. Athol Fugard brings forth
what he wants to say in a straightfor-
ward and emotional way.

A Lesson From /lloes is about life in

South Africa during the apartheid,

which is still in existence today. It's
main characters are Piet Bezuiden-
hout, his wife Gladys, and his friend
Steve Daniels, who has just been
released from prison and who is leav-
ing South Africa, in exile, to England.

The play centers around Steve's
exile to England and the effect that it
will have. Fugard's well-written
script takes one through a series of
trials and tribulations, not only with
Piet and Steve, but with Gladys as
well.

Fugard named the play approp-
riately. Piet refers to the aloe plant as
having a "survival mechanism" that
permits it to survive through many
hardships. Fugard's Piet has his own
survival mechanism; hence, the
name, A Lesson From /iloes.

Piet's survival mechanisms are
very interesting indeed. For example,
he'll admit to a lie just to make things
easier on himself: he admits to turn-
ing Steve in to the authorities, which
results in a very agonizing jail sent-
ence for Steve, even though he didn't
do anything of the kind. Piet's reason
for admitting to the lie is that it would
make it easier for him to say goodbye
to his good friend Steve.

Matthew Vaky's direction was
good on the staging end. His big mis-
take, though, was casting the young
Leland Gantt in the part of the
middle-aged Steve. Even though
Gantt had his hair greyed, he did not
seem middle-aged at all. There are
certain nuances about being middle-
aged that cannot be copied by a con-
siderably younger actor onstage.‘

The stand-out performance of the

By LINDA HENRY

Lovers, the final full-length show
this term in the University of Pitts-
burgh Studio Theatre, closes this
weekend. It is the most interesting
production of this active semester,
which has provided free entertain-
ment for Pitt undergraduates and
offered theater majors the opportun-
ity to explore new concepts.

This show is exactly that — an
exploration by M.F.A. directing stu-
dent Richard Ewing. He chose the
play for what it reminded him of —
Our Town gone sour. Ewing adapted
the ”Winners" segment of Brian
Friel's Lovers, using the image of the
return of the ghost to view the past.

A love story about two Irish teen-
agers, Mag and Joe, who are days
from their wedding (Mag is preg-

evening was given by Bingo O’Mal-
ley. Once again, O’Mally proves that
he is one of Pittsburgh's finest local
actors. His feelings are totally
genuine, and his every move onstage
portrayed that of his character and
not of himself. He talked to the other
actors, and not merely recited lines,
as do too many local actors.

nant), the play shows them as they
are studying for final exams on a hill-
side from which they never return. In
Friel's version, an older couple from
the community, serving as a Greek
chorus, relate events which take
place after the day we see Mag and
Joe. Ewing's adaptation replaces the
older couple with the haggard-
looking ghosts of Mag and Joe and, in
an attempt at expressionism, has
sequences where the two couples
interrelate.

The effect is unclear at times, espe-
cially when the two couples change
places (alive for dead and vice-versa)
in the second act. Also, beginning the
second act is a dream ballet choreo-
graphed by Cece Donoghue; it. is
interesting and an effective mood-
setter but not quite connected with
the action.

Holmes, who really looked and acted
the part of the feeble and unstable
Gladys. She and O’Mally paced them-
selves well and gave each other the
"space" that was needed by both of
them to successfully pull off not only
the stunning first act but the entire
show.

Bonnie Vaky's set was somewhat
sparse, but it conveyed the feeling

VVVVVV

Although baffling to the point of
irritating at moments, Ewing should
be commended for taking risks and
striving for something so different in

_ a studio environment (which should

be available for experimentation ).

Acting was some of the best of the
season at Pitt. The first act was prac-
tically a vehicle for Mary Jo Kelly. Her
face expressed enough to have done
the show without talking (although
in the arena setting it would have
been ludicrous).

John Lang was compelling as the
reserved "alive" Joe, and Philip Win-

ters, as l0e's ghost, emoted powerful
eerieness.

Though confusing and somewhat
trite at times, Lovers is somehow mov-
ing with strong performances and an
aura of innovation.

necessary. Especially facinating was
the effect that she used to create the
bedroom and still make it look realis-
tic in the terms of the rest of the set.
A Lesson From /iloes contains truth of
the horrors that are involved in the
South African apartheid, and the
Pittsburgh Laboratory brings out
these horrors vividly. /iloes is yet
another excellent effort by the Lab.

Lena Horne

 TIIH IE ILA IDSV us A «I: IH AM ID A

By LISA LAVALLE

”If You Believe” is the showstop-
ping number Lena Horne sang in the
movie The Wiz; and it could very well
be her theme song, for despite all the
odds against her, she is an enduring
superstar of the entertainment
world.

In a career spanning over 45 years,
starting with her debut as a chorus
dancer at Harlem's famed Cotton
Club up until her most recent tri-
umph with Lena Horne: The Lady and Her
Music, she has always taken chances.
Horne has dared to be more and to
ask more of herself and her audience,
and those risks have made her a "liv-
ing legend," a term that the lady her-
self dismisses along with ‘raves
concerning her beauty.

”I have never consideed myself a
glamorous superstar,” she says.
"Especially now that my looks are
gone and I am settled into old age.’-’

However, there are many who
strongly disagree with
_Horne’s statement. For Lena Home is
ageless, graceful and elegant. Off-
stage, she was draped in a dazzling
red cape, wearing brillant ruby ear-
rings and enough diamonds to go into
the jewelery business. And, although
Horne is a dynamic singer-
performer, she is perhaps more fam-
ous for her equisite beauty.

Born in Brooklyn on June 30, 1917,
the daughter of an actress and a hotel
operator, Horne's early life was an
unsettling one, with her parents
divorcing shen she was three. She
spent most of her childhood living
with various relatives, including
Cora Calhoun Horne, her paternal
grandmother. According to Hgrne,
Cora was an imposing woman who
greatly shaped and influenced her
life.

”In fact," she says, ”it was my
grandmother who entered my name
as a member of the NAACP —— when I
was a mere two years old.” Horne

-went on to praise the NAACP and

said that: ”They have come to my
rescue frequently, and in many ways,
I considered the NAACP as my
second family.”

The NAACP has influenced
Horne’s outlook on life. During

Showcase, Friday, December 2, 1983

world War II, it was Horne — who
was the pin-up for thousands of black
G.I.’s -— who was firm in her refusal
to perform on USO tours unless
black soldiers were admitted to the
audience.

”It is a natural reaction for me to
resent unfairness; for myself, for my
musicians, for my family and for in
people," she says. '

But then Horne never was one to
avoid controversy. In the 1940 s and
early '50s, her enemies didn't appre-
ciate her friendship with singer Paul
Robeson, her fund-raising for leftist

  
   
  
 

nate that so many performers killed
themselves during the McCarthy’
period. 7, ‘Q

”I think that I was very lucky‘.
because I /was black and I wasn't in:
competition with any white starsior ;:
movie actors and there were not that‘ If
many of us lblacks] being blacklisted.
Moreover, I wasn't going to say thatl 
wasn't a friend of Paul Robesonfor-.. 
anyone else that I worked with who 
was accused of being a Communist. It; I 

was a very realistic experienc'e,,and 
I'm lucky I made it through that 

time,” states Horne. "I think that-
when you have other priorities, it

doesn't kill you when you have to

turn left." I

ing actively
NAACP, Horne found that her low
profile was gone forever. In the early
'40s, she was a star, forshe kepther
mouth shut. But for 30 years after"
she started speaking out, Home was
scarcely visible to the public. How-
ever, all of this has changed; her
career suddenly took off again two
years ago on Broadway with Lena
Horne: The Lady and Her Music. .

The show is the brainchild of
Home and Sherman Sneed, who
created it as a musical drama that tells
the story of a young black girl from
Brooklyn, New York, whose show
business career encompassed the
Cotton Club, the Big Band Era, the
Hollywood movie years, the Broad-
way scene and the '60s protest era.»
Horne herself calls it an ”autobiogra-
phical mixture of favorite songs,
cherished and not-so-cherished
memories.”

In many ways, Horne's show deals
with the difficulties faced by many
black performers. And although

groups or the fact that her name was
imprinted in the anti-Communist
journal ”Red Channels.” This led
directly to Horne's blacklisting from
movies and TV.

”I couldn't get work for about six
years,” she explains. "I couldn't get
TV; I couldn't get radio. Finally, I
went to work in England, and that is
where I first began to be important.
However, the only places that I was
permitted to work at were cabarets. I
overcame all of these adversities,
though, because I had to pay my
bills." Horne says that it was unfortu-

for black entertainers have improved,
she feels that it's quicker for blacks to
obtain success today.

"It will be wonderful if blacks can
make the surge last," she says. ”Look
at Michael Jackson; he is one of the
great few, along with Pryor and
Aretha." '

After almost 50 years in the busi-
ness she loves, Horne says that she

come a long way, and I feel great!”

 

r—Easy As ABC”n

By DELORES RICE

The theme -— there's no business
like show business — permeates the
magnetic air within the tunneled-out
concrete jungle between Hillman
Library and Forbes Quadrangle. Pitt
passers-by are attracted to the scene
as they look and stop, hoping their
brief stay will answer some
questions.

Who are those bearded men
dressed in army fatigues with subma-
chine guns slung over their
shoulders? Who is the somewhat

frazzled one giving orders through

the bullhorn, checking camera angles
and seeing if there's enough light?
And who is the one in all black jump-~
ing off the back of Hillman Library
onto foam pads over and over again?
You decide to move closer.
”Camera rolling, ACTION!" is heard
as a uniformed man jumps onto one
of the shrubbery planters and is shot,

blood magically gushing from his
chest. You watch as they prepare for
the next scene and see that it was
actually a balloon filled with Karo
syrup and red food coloring planted
inside his uniform. It was set off to
”spurt” by an explosive charge which
was triggered by the actor himself.
The man behind the camera is

approached by someone who looks

like a reporter, and you casually stroll
into earshot to find out who he is.

His name is Terry Huud, a junior at
Point Park College and co-director of
Child's Play. Huud explains that this is
an 8- to 10-minute film, which paral-
lels the video game ”Pacman” to a
renegade fleeing the oppressive sys-
tem. The Pacman scenes were filmed
at an arcade in Point Park College.
The majority of the film is the chase
scenes which are being filmed around
Pitt. .

The man dressed in the black

‘ Hillman Library, shot one of the sys-

film distributors have expressed
interest in purchasing the film, and it
could open doors for these two young
filmmakers (Huud is 21, Homer is
18).
A Horner, who is just completing a
set of acting classes at the Pittsburgh
Playhouse, enjoyed being in frontof
the camera as well as behind. During
one attack scene, he was required to
run, jump, roll and shoot. It took
seven takes before Huud and Homer
were satisfied.

”At-least in real life, soldiers have
to do it only, once," Horner quipP€d-

From time to time, Homer and
Huud would consult a binder which
was filled with storyboards (dF3W“‘
out versions of each scene). To have
every scene come across on film
exactly as you would imagine it must

sweater, trousers, boots and topped
with a black beret joins the group. He
is Carl Horner, a former student at
Point Park College, co-director — and
an actor in the film as well — of Child's
Play. Through the course of the day,
he has jumped jumpedoff the side of

tern oppressors and suffered a bullet
hole in the leg. But not to worry — he
eventually wins out in the long run.

And it has been a long run. They
have filmed three days straight from
7 a-m- Until 4 P-UL (which is a lot for

the resulting five minutes of the be difficult. But these two filmmak-

’Endearment’:Enduring The L

Terms of endearment are those
familiar, affectionate names given to
family and close friends. The other
”terms of endearment” refers to the
long periods of confinement —— often
lifetimes — spent tolerating some-
one’s quirks and habits out of love.
Paramount's Terms of Endearmenl
explores both sides of its title.

Shirley MacLaine is Aurora Green-
way, widowed even before the credits
have rolled by and left with a young
daughter, Emma (who grows up into
Debra Winger). Fiercely independ-
ent, Aurora exercises complete con-
trol over nearly all of her life. The
exception is her daughter, equally
adept at standing by herself. Mom
disapproves strongly when Emma
marries Flap Horton (Jeff Daniels), an
up—and-coming English professor.
Aurora boycotts the wedding and
grimly waits for the union to fold so
she can say ”told you so.”

The open and equal relationship

Showcase, Friday, December 2, 1983

with her daughter has beensufficient
for Aurora. She dismisses several
ardently potential suitors merely by
ignoring them. Next door to the
Greenways, though, lives Garrett
Breedlove, an overweight and amor-
ous former astronaut who takes
advantage —— indirectly — of Emma's
absence to ply his attentions on her
mother. Resisting strongly at first
(”There is something wrong with

you,” she responds to his first propo- I

sition), Aurora falls for Breedlove’s
rather wayward charm.

Mom's sexual rebirth crosscuts
with Emma and Flap’s fight/kiss-and-
make-up domestic life. Three child-
ren arrive in a well-condensed period
of years. Emma -- with evidence —
doubts her husband's fidelity. Partly
from need and partly out of revenge,
she enters into an affair with Sam
Burns (John Lithgow), a pallid and
repressed banker.

Emma develops cancer — a sur-

prise, and her disintegrating mar-
riage hangs in suspension. When the
doctors diagnose the cancer as termi-
nal, she's left with some difficult
decisions.

MacLaine and Winger — open and
believable as equal partners -— cap-
ture wonderfully the mother-
daughter relationship, the key (and
most charming aspect) of the film.
Jack Nicholson's unpretentious per-
formance as the hedonistic astronaut
nicely balances MacLaine’s wry

‘widow. Director James Brooks estab-

lishes their cat-and-mouse relation-

McMurtry’s novel. The two halves of
it do not integrate with consistency.
The first hour borders on slapstick
comedy —— truly funny situations,
such as Garrett's first lunch date with
Aurora, culminating in a drunken,
fully-clothed swim at the beach. Early
melodramatic elements — Emma and
Flap as a seriously bickering couple —
register as intrusive, leaving the
viewer confused. Similarly, moments

of comedy (a hilarious New York City

party for Emma's benefit, for exam-
ple) seem to be out of place within the
sincere tragedy of the last half. 9

Still, Terms of Endearment develops
real, emotionally valid characters in a
series of generally fine vignettes
spaced over a_period of years. The
performances provide the center of
interest, but — in terms of MacLaine,

Stiv Bator

By Frank DiGiacomo

"Pop has become solemn, irrelevant and
boring. What it needs now is more noise, more
size, more sex, more violence, more gim-
‘miclcry, more vulgarity. Above all, it desper-
ately needs a new messiah who will take
things right back to the glamour, power and
insanity of the Elvis Presley age."

— Pete Townshend

Friends, parishioners, welcome to
the church of rock-nl-roll — the New
Church. Tonight's guest evangelist is
the Rev. Stiv Bator. Hymns will be
taken from two albums, Lords Of The
New Church and ls Nothing Sacred? Please
stand and welcome Bator by joining
him in singing "Live For Today.”

If rock-n-roll can be considered the
religion that some say it is, then Stiv
Bator is its Billy Graham. That's
because this founder of the Lords Of
The New Church and former Dead
Boy has a lot to say about rock's role
as a spiritual persuasion in addition to
his band's part as a symbol of the
"new age of man.”

Ironically, sitting in the dressing
room at Club Heaven, Bator looks
more like a freshly exorcised demon
than a prophet of things to come.
Perched between his two beaming,
middle-classish parents, who have
come from Youngstown, Ohio, to see
their only child perform, Bator
strikes a blatant contrast in his jet-
black attire and hair-mop. His eyes
are hidden by thick, dark glasses, and
his lips project a permanent sneer. A
heavy silver cross hangs from his left
ear, suggesting a mockery of his 12
years of education in the Young-
stown parochial school system.

On The Pulpit:

CHURCH OF THE
POISONED MIND?

There are many more paradoxical
qualities about Stiv Bator. For one,
his electric, maniacal and often vio-
lent concert performances are quite
different from his off—stage manner-
isms. Away from the spotlight, he is a
polite, soft—spoken and articulate
artist. For another, Bator is damned
intelligent for someone who dropped
out of Youngstown State University
after six months. He speaks with a
quiet command of his subject, and if
he bullshits, he knows how to back it
up with facts and convictions.

Indeed, a lot of Bator’s rhetoric
sounds like it came straight from the
National Enquirer, though he will be the
first to say that the Lords Of The
New Church are merely operating
from an informational standpoint.

"What we say is just information;
take it or leave it. We're not saying
that ‘we're the truth’; in fact, our
main manifesto is for everyone not to
believe anyone,” he says. "Instead,
listen to everything. Don't just read
American papers or Russian papers;
read and listen to everything -
acquire all the knowledge you can,
and then figure it out for yourself.”

That's right, he wants everyone to
just listen to what he has to say. If it
goes down without tasting of balo-
ney, then file it under "Rock-n-Roll
Prophecies.” If it smacks of the deli
counter, well, Stiv says he and the
rest of the Lords won't mind. So,
onward ye crusaders of the faith.

According to Bator, the Lords Of
The New Church was formed some-
time in 1982, after the final breakup
of the Dead Boys and after his only
solo album, Disconnected, on Bomp

Records. Bator went to England and
recruited former Damned guitarist
Brian James, Sham 69 bassist Dave
Tregunna and Baracudas' drummer
‘.\licky Turner for his new group. The
new band released Lords Of The New
Church, their acclaimed debut, which
was chock-full-o-heavy metal and
ominous lyrics. Their second release,
ls Nothing Sacred.7, while it failed to cap-
ture as much critical praise, estab-
lished the Lords as a band with an
equally ominous message.

Part of that message lies in the
band's suggestive moniker.

Bator claims that the "New
Church" symbolizes the band's
attempt to unify the warring punk
factions (such as the skinheads vs. the
teddy boys vs. the rastas etc.) in Eng-

land and wherever they may exist. He

says that the British press is largely
responsible for splintering the once
solitary punk movement into a bunch
of hostile gangs.

"They [the press] split everybody
up and started everybody fighting
each other," he explains. "What we're
trying to do is make everyone in Eng-
land and, really, all of the world real-
ize that they're not at war with each
other. They all love rock-n‘-‘roll -— it's
all the same, actually —— so they
should unite and fight the real enemy
which is totalitarianism."

Of course, that's an awfully broad
term, but under Bator’s interpreta-
tion, totalitarianism seems to have a
lot to do with organized religion.
Essentially, he sees religion, espe-
cially the Catholic church, as a brain-
washing, profiteering Organization
that gives no guidance to today's
youth.

”The church has failed the young
people, and if you dig deeper, you'll
find that the Vatican has lied to eve-
rybody for years —— it's just another
type of mind control," he says.

So how does one combat this creep-
ing form of illicit manipulation —

BRIAN IE5

  
 
    
     

with rock-n-roll, of course. He sees
rock music as the new creed for the
young breed. "Rock-n-roll is the v01C€

of the youth," he explains. "Not onl)’¢,
has it replaced parents in the '50s and

politics in the '60s, but now, itis
replaced religion in the'80s. It's reli-
gion of the young."

Consequently, in the fine tradition

of most theologies, the Lords Oz’ The
New Church fill their music f~.Il of
apocalyptic visions and impassioned
warnings to prepare for the end.
However, these tunes are supposedly
non—pulpy attempts at musical
science fiction. According to Bator,
Armageddon is just around the
corner, and while it may not resemble

Showcase, Friday, December 2, I983

The Day After, things are going to get
pretty sloppy around here.

He talks about places like Copenha-
gen, where he says the city is divided
into opposing groups of youths ruled
by motorcycle gangs and skinheads
but no police. He speaks of rising
Nazism in Europe and the major
bloodbath that is imminent. He
quotes the Bible, saying over and
over that this apocalypse cannot be
prevented. It's enough for a sequel to
Road Warrior.

Then, after painting this crimson-
red scenario, Bator says, with non-
chalance, that people should be happy,
that this is going to occur because it

will bring with it a new dawn of man.
"Don't fear what's about to happen
because it's meant to be. Just prepare
for a new age of man, which is going
to be a transmutation, a higher levy
of being,” he explains. ”People are
going to survive on what they know
within themselves. So celebrate the
arrival of the new humanity.”
Judging by this statement and tak-

’ing into account Mr. Bator's

"untamed" appearance, it is not sur-
prising that his career as a Lord of the
New Church has been filled with con-
troversy. Some may say that being
provocative is just another part of
being a rock star, but while Mick
Jagger or Jimmy Page may raise a few
eyebrows with their convictions, Stiv
Bator gets thrown in jail or shot for
voicing his.

Just this past November, he spent
three days in a Finland prison for
kicking in the glass door of a night-
club, strewing rubbish inside and
flashing a "shiny object" at the
bouncers after they wouldn't let him
and the rest of the bandmembers
inside (because, he says, of the way
they looked). He, alone, was charged
with assault with a deadly weapon
and intent to kill.

The group, however, was permit-
ted to finish the final show  the
European leg of their tour (BM-.;'“ was
escorted to and from the show. by the
Finland police). He says he lucked out
in this situation because the US.
diplomat in Finland knew Lords’
manager Miles Copeland's father,
who is head of the’CIA in Europe, and
also because he convinced the police
that the shiny object was "really a
chrome cigarette lighter" and not a
knife.

Bator was not so fortunate in an
incident that occurred last summer in
Los Angeles. During a concert, he
was shot by a group of beach punks
whom he had just finished telling to
stop fighting. The makeshift carbon

eAv1=_ TREGUNNA

dioxide cartridge projectile pierced
his side and fractured a couple of ribs.

"They were fighting, and we
stopped playing," he says. "I told
them, ’Every time you fight, the cops
close down your club, so you're just
helping the police bring it one step
further to a police state.’ I told them
they were stupid. We started up the
song, and I got shot. So, I guess it
happened because I told the truth.”

Events like this would usually be
sufficient to make even the heartiest
performer re-evaluate his stance, but
Bator claims to be undaunted by all of
his misfortune. In fact, he says it has
the opposite effect on him and the
Lord.

"It encourages us because it just
makes us stronger every time we
bounce back. These people are fools,"
he says of groups like the beach
punks and the skinheads. "They read
the press, especially the LA. people,
and whatever they see going on in
England, they try to duplicate -
except that they misinterpret it, turn
it Hollywood and just do all the
wrong things with it. We're just try-
ing to wise people up to it."

Bator sees a lot of the violenc_e in
the punk movement as a result of
scared kids’ looking for attention and
power. "Consequently, all of the indi-
viduals who have no personalities but
are still trying to make a statement
find that it's safe to group together,”
he explains. ”They obtain power and
attention through hate — if they
can't write a song, they go out and
break somebody’s head open with a
bottle to get attention. That's what's
happening.”

So that's what's going on in the
world today. People are beating the
crap out of each other; little Hitlers
are goose-stepping to the tune of a
Fourth Reich; Armageddon is chic;
and Stiv Bator is showing the wound
in his side and saying, ”It has all been
foretold, so 'two-thousand, zero,
zero, party's over, whoops, out of
time,’ let's all celebrate the coming of
the new age of man." In the mean-
time, his parents sit nodding and
smiling at their son.

What do they think of all this?
According to Bator, his parents really
like it. "My dad was a singer during

Page I7

World War II with Kay Kvser and
Tommy Dorsey, but he eventually
gave it up because he wanted to settle
down," he says. ”So he's sort of reliv-
ing it through me. Mom likes it, too."

Strangely enough, Bator's parents,
who are both Catholic, do not seem to
be affected by his often provocative
(many would say sacrilegious) treat-
ment of divinity in both his lyrics and

this stage antics. During the show,

Bator can frequently be seen mocking
the sign of the cross and "crucifying"
himself on the drumset while Nicky
Turner leaps over him. It is stuff like
this that would turn any semi-
religious man ashen with horror, but
Mr. and Mrs. Bator seem to take it all l
with a nod and a smile. "They just
figure that I know what I'm doing and
that I'm going to do what I'm going to
do," he says. ”They respect that."

Even more astonishing is the fact
that he credits his Catholic educa-
tion with opening his eyes; not
because of the rigorous curriculum
but because it forced him to be a non-
conformist. "I had 12 years of paroch-
ial schooling, and you either come out
a wimp or a rebel," he explains. "It
really helped me out a lot. It showed
me what was going on in the world —
it gave me the drive to get out of
Youngstown, and I'm still burning
with that. You see, if I failed, where
would I come back to? It’s5a'prison
there, and so many people take this as
the way it's meant to be -— they just
live with it. It's crazy."

With this statement, Bator creates
yet another paradox. In one breath,
heclaims that the decline of Western
civilization is inevitable, and in
another, he maintains that it's possi-
ble to escape from determinism, The
two statements are contradictory
and once again dredge up that creepy
feeling that maybe Stiv Bator is
laughing his ass off behind those dark
glasses and that eloquent rhetoric of
his.

That, of course, is for the reader to
decide. Maybe Bator is a leather-clad
rock messiah; maybe he's full of shit.
In any case, he and the Lord Of The
New Church have the noise, the size,
the vulgarity, the insanity and, yes,
the gimmickry that Pete Townshend
says rock-n—roll needs to live on.

DASHIELL HAMMETT: A LIFE
By Diane Johnson
Random House

The photo of Dash Hammett
appearing on the cover of A Life is
rope enough to catch the reader — a
snapshot of the head and shoulders of
the author fronting a clouded sky;
Dark, handsome and positively film
noire.

. Diane Johnson's articulate . bio-
graphy within that cover proves a
good match‘. Dashiell Hammett’s fer-
tile mind and pen created a whole
(and widely imitated) genre of detec-
tive fiction. Theltitles are enough to
evoke pleasant memories — The Mal-
tese Falcon, The Glass Key, The Dain Curse,
Red Harvest. Oddly, after 1934's excel-

lent The Thin Man, Hammett never

again completed a novel.

Johnson's conscientious and jour-
nalistic portrait of the artist draws on
authorized sources — his private cor-
respondence, family and playwright
Lillian Hellman, a longtime friend of
Hammett’s. His life story generates
as much fascination as his fiction.
With more photos (Hammett wore a
‘neat haircut), a selected bibliography
and usefully extensive notes.

GROWING UP
By Russell Baker

Plume

Columnist/humorist Russell Baker
deservedly won the 1983 autobio-
graphy Pulitzer for Growing Up, a
straightforward, lively look at the pro-
cess. Baker's mother tartly and repeat-
edly advised him to make something of
himself. “I decided that what I’d like to
be when I grew up was a writer,” he
states. Hefound himself a career in liter-
ature’s “bastard offspring, journalism.”

Growing Up defines the V simple
delights and pains of childhood while
retaining the adult perspective. Mark
Twain was able to do it. And Harper
Lee in To Kill A Mockingbird. A difficult
chore at which Baker succeeds
admirably.

Pointless spreading adjectives over
this. Growing Up stands by itself, an
example of biography as a fine art.

Lana Turner remembers when she
became a legend. She was 54.
”Sweater Girl” Turner, a triumph of
facade over substance and one of few

_ surviving reminders of the glamour

profession that was Hollywood in the
19405, offers her own version of bio-

would applaud the real Lana Turner,”
she muses at one point, a response to
a terrific ovation.

She offers explanations and
excuses for her movie career, her
seven husbands and Cheryl — the
problem daughter and only child who
kitchen—knifed to death (in 1958)
Mom's gangster—lover, Johnny
Stompanato.

A dramatic fairy tale; soap-operatic
glitz -—— an approved transom-peek at
Turner's life. How much has been
omitted or dismissed can't very well
be known, but Lana is fun on that
level. And the photographs of her are
beautiful.

*<

-Nearly anyone who's still alive
from the movie Hollywood of several
decades ago is considered ”great” and
"legendary." Actor James Cagney,
though, seems qualified. He resur-
faced in 1981 with Ragtime, his first
film role in two decades. During that
hiatus, Cagney had pieced together
an autobiography —— Cagney By Cagney.

A new one, James Cagney: The Autho-
rized Biography, either supplements its
predecessor or eliminates the need
for it entirely. Cagney the actor per-
fected a stereotype — the cocky
tough guy —_ in films like The Public
Enemy and White Heat. But his favorite
part was out of that line — his
Academy Award—winning George M.
Cohan in Yankee Doodle Dandy..

Cagney "has always considered it
ludicrous for the public to lionize per-
formers,” according to Doug Warren.
A shame Cagney can't see it from our
side. Why else would we want to read
his life story? But it has been an
earthy one. Warren offers a facile and
lightweight treatment of Cagney’s
life, referring to the actor familiarly

  

 

as ”Jimmy.” A standard bio, gener-
ally, sparked by the actor's direct
observations. With photos and com-
plete filmography.

iiroiﬁiirs TV GUIDE
Ed. By Gerald Sussman
Crown

We have a rough tendency to avoid
any humor book which describes
itself as ”wacky” on the backgcover
but will make an exception for Not
Quite TV Guide, a well-done roast of a
venerable institution.

Everything matches the "real” one.
Don't miss shows like
Pecker” and ”Shave Your Puppy," or
McLean Stevenson's 83rd «series,
”That’s Stupid.” Up for a good flick?
Watch Sex Object, a 1983 release star-
ring Shelley Winters, or .Leper‘Boys,
about the infection of Detroit (star-
ring the Vienna Boys’ Choir).

According to Not Quite’s latest poll,
most of America still thinks Walt

Cronkite still anchors the CBS news.

Advertisements? ”Reach out and piss
off someone. Call collect.” Editor
Gerald Sussman (late of National lam-
poon) and crew successfully pull off
this light and sure parody.

SHORT SHORTS

 

Ed. By Irving Howe and Ilana Wiener J

Howe
Bantam

Not the item of clothing. The edi-
tors of Short Shorts have collected 38
well- and not—so-well-known exam-

ples of the shortest of short stories."

Familiar authors -—— Tolstoy, Chek-
hov, de Maupassant, Thurber,‘Mar—
quez — at their briefest, and a good
cross section of cultures and times.

Short shortstories condense the
writing process; the author has to
work even harder at creating a mem-
orable moment and quickly convinc-
ing the reader — sort of a literary
sucker punch. Hemingway's ”A
Clean, Well- Lighted Place” does it, so
does William Carlos William's ”The
Use of Force.” And Crane’s chilling
”An Episode of War.”

‘An anthology of comfortable wri- /I

ters with the added appeal of brevity.
Pleasurable; ideal for the literature
fan with budgeted time.

INFIDELS
Bob Dylan
Columbia

Many undoubtedly will heap
praise on the deserving
shoulders of Dire Straits
guitarist-extraordinaire Mark
Knopfler, who is credited with
co-production. Others will
credit the impressive gathering
of talented studio musicians.
There is certainly logic behind
these explanations, but make no
mistake about it: it is Bob Dylan

‘who is responsible for lnfidels,

the most remarkable comeback
album ever made by an Ameri-
can performer.

As the Rolling Stones did
with the release of Some Girls in_
1978 and as the Who did a year
later with Who Are You, Dylan
has re-emerged from years of
self-indulgence and confusion
not only to reiterate but to reaf-
firm and expand the musiscal
influences that made him a
larger—than—life artist from the
mid—’60s on.

Infidels combines all the wit,
charm, introspection and reflec-
tion that have signaled great-
ness in Bob Dylan records since
Highway 61 Revisited more than
15 years ago. Not since.1973 and
Blood On The Tracks, however,
has Dylan mastered the sophis-
ticated melodies and biting lyr-
ics that drive lnfidels to
greatness. But, as Dylan
explains in "I And I," "I got
nothing to say... 'bout whatever

STAR FLEET PROJECT
Brian May and Friends
Capitol

During a year's break from
Queen, guitarist Brian May has
gotten together with some
friends and produced his first
solo effort, Star Fleet Project, a
three—song mini lp.

The thing is, May's playmates

special: guitarist
Eddie Van Halen, drummer
Alan Gratzer (REO Speed-

'wagon), Phil Chen (Rod Ste-
wart's former bass player) and
keyboardist Fred Mandel (for-
merly of Alice Cooper's band
and recently on Queen's last
tour).

The album's three songs are
essentially nothing spectacular;
the title track, "Star Fleet,” is
the theme song of a British Sat-
urday morning kid's show,
something on the order of
”Ultra-Man.” "Let Me Out" is a
song that May wrote for Queen
that was never released, and
"Blues Breaker” is a 13-minute
instrumental that takes up all of
side two.

What is spectacular about Star
Fleet Project is its featured first-
time combination of two of rock
and roll’s most outstanding
innovators: May and Van
Halen. I

Out of their traditional envi-
ronments, the two guitarists
individually exhibit a new and
different (though still easily rec-
ognizable) style.

"

"\

”This is no time to look back”
is what Dylan is saying. With
the knowledge that the past
contains nearly as much defeat
as it does triumph, Dylan real-
izes that he can afford only to be
respectful, not patronizing or
romantic, about his experien-
ces. And so, there is no "Like a
Rolling Stone” here, no "Blow-
ing in the Wind.” In their place
are minor classics, circa 1983;
"Sweetheart Like You,” ”Neigh-
borhood Bully” and ”Union
Sundown” are all songs that rise
above the majority of present
day piffle passed off as "hits."

‘Bob Dylan has returned,
thankfully, not overburdened
with apologies or excuses but
armed for renewed poetic bat-
tle. In what is probably the fin-
est moment on lnfidels, Dylan
closes the record by pleading,
"Don't Fall Apart on Me
Tonight.” One gets the sense,
however, that the singer has
already done his falling apart
and come out the better for it in
the end, He sees no chance of it's
happening again, at least not to
himself, and therefore, he's not
really posing a question _at all,
but instead, offering delicate
advice.

Outstanding performances
are everywhere on this wonder-
ful record — Knopfler's guitar
work in particular — after lis-
tening to the album several
times, one thing remains clear:
this is classic Dylan.

BRIAN I. FISCHER

3-<2», BOB DYLAN -4"-

 

Showcase, Friday, December 2, 1983

Together, the blend of May's
classical fluency and Van Hal-
en's heavy metal is devastating.

"Blues Breaker” is a no-holds-
barred jam session. The solos of
May and Van Halen are equal in
excellence to anything of the
great blues masters, including
Eric Clapton, to whom the song
is dedicated.

On "Let Me Out" and ”Star
Fleet” as well, both guitarists
display an incredible versatility
unseen in their previous work.

This is especially true for Van‘

Halen. -

This is an album that, despite
its short length, definitely ranks
high among the greatest rock
and roll guitar albums. As
always, it's a special treat when
a group of very talented musi-
cians gets together to jam, and
with Brian May and Eddie Van
Halen combining their vast tal-
ents for the first (and hopefully
not the last) time, Star Fleet Project
is probably the best recent
offering from most of the famil-
iar faces.

news: I was wrong. The Hips-
ters may have been laying low
for awhile, but they have a new

single out and — you could've‘

guessed it, but I'll tell you any-
way — it's real good.

Dick McKuen (author of
"Rumours of War" and "Media
Blitz,” the two Hipster tracks on
that aforementioned lp) has
written another anthem with
"Rock Around The Communist
Block,” a song that owes more
to sensible pop roots than the
rockabilly it will be mistaken for
imitating. The Hipsters have
always acknowleged — in their

music —— all the different edges -

to the rock genre, and indeed,
things haven't changed. "Road
to Damascus,” written by voca-
list/guitarist Rueben Sairs, is a

slower, almost folkish number '

that could have been fodder for
The Band. Political observation
and comment is evident, but the
Hipsters’ satiric twists make it
more palatable than the hard-
core stance taken by so many

_ bands of the punk and post-

System. There is, really. Peter
Schilling, from West Germany,
presents his American debut.
Let's not postulate and general-
ize about the current state of
European pop music; instead,
let's look at this album in partic-
ular and see why it doesn't
work. Part of it might be Schil-
ling's by-now tiresome "in this
space age, we're all robotsl
dreams are useless/let's dance
anyway" philosophy.

Schilling plays no instru-
ments. Lead guitarist Armin
Sobal helped with the compos-
ing chores. Two others pro-
vided English translations to
Schilling's lyrics. He might have
learned the syllables phoneti-
cally, considering his sterile
vocal treatments. His enuncia-
tion is (clear, certainly, but) arch
and pretentious; his limp and
lifeless tenor lacks even a hint of
emotion and quickly grows
irritating.

Schilling has an undeniable
hit with "Major Tom (Coming
Home)/' the blatant David
Bowie/"Space Oddity" rip—off
currently flooding the airwaves.
The song features a good tune,
anyway; perhaps the lyrics
aren't nearly as offensive in
their original German.

The "Major Tom" underpin-
nings .— skittery, thumping
bass and drum —- support three
other songs on the album:
"Only Dreams" (practically a
“T503 COPY); "The Noah Plan"

continued on page twenty-one

continued from page twenty

and the title track. Schilling
offers obligatory reggae with
”Lifetime Guarantee.” The
music itself is generally clean,
sparse and well-thought out,
but the sterile vocal treatments
sink the effort.

Evidence — already — of
musical excess surfaces. Why is
”Major Tom, Part Two,”
included here, an instrumental
which Schilling didn't even
write? ”Stille Nacht, Heilege
Nacht" serves political com-
mentary via the familiar ”Silent
Night, Holy Night” carol, but
it's sung (or tunelessly chanted,
mostly) in German to a ridicu-
lously minimalistic accompan-
iment.

”(Let’s Play) U.S.A.” pokes
fun at the American way of life.
How I love the life I lead/Cannot think
and cannot read/ Watch our values slip
away/Play the game of U.5./i....
Why, then, has Peter Schilling
attempted to crack our lucrative
market? The act of purchasing
Error in the System only corrobo-
rates his opinion.

WHERE'S THE PARTY? 1
Eddie Money
Columbia Records

Something dead and gone/Still
somehow it's hanging on/I can hear the
sounds/Like it's all around//ind then I
hear it over and over and over. These
lyrics, from the final cut, per-
fectly describe Where's the Party?
in its entirety. Without fail, each
song drones on and on, until by
the end, you cannot distinguish
one song from another.

Eddie Money's sliding, slur-
ring vocals accompany a not-so-
crisp, not-so-new teeny—bop
rock sound. If he were playing
to a 14-year-old audience,
Money might pull it off; but,
otherwise, his latest leaves you
wondering if this guy is ever
going to grow up._

There is nothing new about
Money's sound...no attempt to
experiment with fresh ideas.
Both ”The Big Crash" and
”Leave it to Me” begin with
what might be called ”the new
sound," but before this sound
has a chance to develop, the
indistinguishable rock-n-roll
beat that is familiar to bands
such as Foreigner and Styx
takes over and mutilates
Money's only hope for musical
success.

The lyrics are another disap-
pointment. With lines like-
,"We’re gonna dosome partying
tonight” and ”On with the
show/'Cause people still love
rock and roll,” Money leaves the
listener crumpled over in laugh-
ter. Is it possible to respect the
creativity of such a lyricist?

If there is to be a redeeming
cut on Where's The Party? ”The
Big Crash” is the sole con-
tender. The story line is sensi-
ble, and the sound is actually a
step above anything else on the

album. This song enables the

listener to believe in the vocal
talents that Eddie Money does
possess but also emphasizes, by
being the only well-thought-
out song on the LP, that Money
has not yet learned to capitalize
upon this talent.

But for now, with his new
release, Money seems quite
content producing mediocrity at
its finest.

Anybody, but anybody, it seems,

would be for a fictitious character to
write an autobiography, and, thus,
we have Roseanne Rosearmadarma's "Hey,

Season

By CHARLIE O'HARA

The Pitt men’s track team
opened its 1983-84 indoor season
last night in a non-scoring meet
with Slippery Rock and Robert
Morris.

Panther coach John Vasvary
entered the meet with the idea of
getting a race under the team’s
belt in order to prepare for next
weekend’s George Mason
Christmas Invitational.

“I think we got out of it what
we wanted,” Vasvary said. “We’Il
have to look over the performan-
ces, but there were some definite
good points.”

The meet turned into more ofa
time trial for the under-matched
Panthers. In several events, there
was no opposition. It didn’t
affect the times all that much,
though.

In the mile, senior Todd Colas
won with a time of 4:08.29.
Senior Bill Moorhead did like-
wise in the 1000-yard run, com-
pleting the distance in 2:20.72.
Garland Brown coasted in the
880-yard run with a time of
1:54.81.

than a half a second. Kingdom’s
6.01 beat Pitt freshmen Jason
Harris (6.55) and Shane Saund-
ers (6.57). It was Kingdom’s first
competitive race since his Pan
Am gold medal performance.

The 300-yard dash was won by
Jason Harris (35.76), and team-
mate Gerard Battle was second
(36.44). In the 440-yard dash,
sophomore Rich Baderinwa
(49.7) nipped teammate Jesse
Mikell (49.71). In the 500-yard,
freshman Alan Laws (l:05.89)
ousted fellow Panther freshman
Jeff Longbottom (1208.87).

The 600-yard run was won by
Panther freshman Tim Manes
(1:l3.73). Pitt's mile relayyteam
of Brown, Laws, Mikell and
Baderinwa finished in 3:24.25.

There were two events on the
track in which the Panthers
failed to come out the winners. In
the 50-yard dash, John Green
(5.49) of Slippery Rock defeated
Panthers Gerard Battle (5.50)
and Ralph Mitton (5.56). In the
two-mile run, Dave Menosky
(9:30.85), running unattached,
beat Pitt freshmen John Thomas
(9235.65) and John Mooney
(9239.94).

In the field events, competi-
tion was a little more noticeable.
In the pole vault, Panther Jim
Johnson (13-6) beat teammate
Rodney Chobany (13-0) and
John Thornton of Robert Mor-
ris (12-6). Mitton won thetriple

Wrestlers Pin Waynesburg 32-6

By TIM DINGER

The Pitt wrestling team opened its

1983-84 dual meet season with a 32-6
rout of Waynesburg at the Field
House Wednesday.

Although the Panthers
nated eight of 10 matches, head
coach Rande Stottlemyer was disap-
pointed with several of his wrestlers
performances.

“It [the match] seemed a little ho-
hum to me. It went slow, which we
expected in some places because we
had some new faces in the line-up,”
Stottlemyer said, “but even some of
our more experienced guys were
holding back - not really cutting
loose.”

Three bright spots in the Pan-
thers’ night were the showings of
senior Joe Throckmorton (134 lbs.)
and sophomore Joe Bond (150 lbs.),
both pinning their opponents, and
senior Jeff Jelic (167 lbs.). who
scored a superior decision.

Throckmorton took a 7-2 deci-
sion before he bar-armed Waynes-
burg’s Mike Buckizo for the 3:26
pm.

Bond started his match off on the
wrong foot by letting Yellow-Jacket
Rick Romeo take him down and put
him to his back, leaving Bond
behind 4-0. Bond quickly remedied
the situation by reversing and pin-
ning Romeo with a near-cradle, just
1:30 into the match.

“Joe was one of the guys I was
really happy with..., he set a good
example.“ Stottlemyer said. “Even

At 118 pounds, Panther Gary
Snyder saw his first varsity action
when he downed Yellow-Jacket
Mark Hogue,\9-4.

With just five seconds remaining
in the match and the score tied at
four apiece, Snyder reversed Hogue
to his back to pull out the match at
the buzzer.

Kyle Nellis of Pitt got his first var-
sity win at 126 pounds as he fought
from behind to overtake Waynes-
burg’s Tim Gump, 7-5.

Gump scored a pair of takedowns
to take a 4-1 lead into the second
period, but Nellis scored an escape
and a takedown and then tilted
Gump for a near fall to go up 6-4.
Gump scored an escape to end the
period. Nellis rode out the third
period, gaining a riding-time advan-
tage and picking up the 7-5 win.

The Yellow Jackets got their first
points on the board at 142 pounds,
when Toddy Eddy decisioned
Panther Gary Bolin 8-5.

The pair had a 5-5 tie mid-way
through the third period, but with 23
seconds left in the match, Eddy
scored a takedown and accumulated
enough riding-time advantage for
the three-point victory.

Steve Burchanti was the only

The Pitt News. Friday, December 2, I983

By MARK A. SINDLER

(Editor's Note: This is the second

of a two-part series diagramming the
Pitt football team is rise from a pro- ‘
jected pre-season 4-7 record to the
heights of8-2-1. Grades were
already asssessed for the offense ear-
lier; the class standing of the defense
will be determined here.)

A sewing needle pricks the skin.
That’s about how much it's going to
hurt to say that Pitt's goal-line pro-
tectors slipped detectably in main-
taining the Panthers’ rich tradition
in “D.”

The needle will puncture the epi-
dermis of those who might seem sad-
dened to hear that Pitt will likely
not, for the sixth straight season,
reign tops in this Division I nation in
rushing and total defense. That same
needle may at most terrorize a hair
follicle of those who cannot differen-
tiate between a gridiron defense and
that found in a courtroom.

Everyone else falling in between
can better understand that the
Panthers returned only two seniors
this year on a line that featured all
first-year starters except for two and

a secondary that delivered half of
last year‘s unit to graduation.

In terms of linebacking, though,
two first-year people orchestrated
their talents as if they were I0-year
veterans.

1 Before grading, though, it’s
instrumental to understand what
this Pitt defense had to live up to
once it traveled to.Knoxville to face
Tennessee on September’s first
weekend. i

That total defense previously
mentioned meant that every oppo-
nent since 1978 has not averaged
more than 226 yards in total offense.
In that same epoch, average ground
yardage has not peaked 88 yards.
And the closest one in each of the
five years has been Southern Cal,
with I08.

Both areas suffered billowing
stats this year, as can be expected
after Pitt lost key linemen in Dave
Puzzuoli and J.C. Pelusi and stal-
warts in secondary people Tim
Lewis and Peep Short. Eleven games
having been played and the Jan. 2
Fiesta Bowl still awaiting, the I983
defense has allowed ll8 rushing
yards per game and 278 yards in
total offense.

Is the castle of a defense reaching
in the crumbling stages? Hardly so.
After all, compared to each of the
past five years, this year's squad held
opponents to about Il.2 points per
game, down from Il.9. And after
facing such 100-yard rushers as Greg
Bell, Allen Pinkett and D.J. Dozier
this year, only one opposing back
creased the century mark when
?l7a2vy’s Napoleon McCallum struck

1983 still will not be remembered
in the same light as years in the pasts
of Hugh Green, Greg Meisner and
Randy Holloway. Grades could be
interpreted as otherwise but only
because lofty expectations are ﬂung
about each season.

Again, parental conferences are
impossible:

End: It may not be difficult to
anger junior Chris Doleman, but
flustering him is another matter.
After the towering rushend was sent
home from fall training camp for
academic ills and dem_oted to third
team, Doleman climbed his way
back to a starting role for a second
year, only to finish third on the team
in sacks, with six.

By scorr omen

Homecomings are supposed to be
festive occasions where one returns
to familar stomping grounds and
relive some pleasant memories. For
Pitt head basketball coach Roy
Chipman, the trip to Easton, Pa. to
play Lafayette, a team he led to two
Eastern Coast Conference cham-
pionships, did not turn out that way.

In fact, it got downright scary at
one point. The Leopards managed
to cut a 14-point deficit down to
three, 44-41 at the ll minute mark.
But forward Clyde Vaughan found
his touch midway though the second
half and combined that with an out-
standing performance from junior
guard George Allen to give the
Panthers a hard-fought 70-55 vic-
tory at Kirby Field House Wednes-
day night.

Allen was the catalyst of a 17-6 *

spurt as the Panthers regained a
comfortable 61-47 lead with 2:19
left. After Lafayette forward Gary

I Bennett charged into Pitt’s Andre

Williams, Allen hit two jumpers
separated by a Bennett tip-in, and
then intercepted a pass intended for
forward Joey Graham and passed to
Vaughan, who proceeded to give the
Panthers a 52-43 lead with a 15-foot
jumper.

That ‘shot finally revived
Vaughan, who was shooting poorly
from the floor during the first half.
The 6-4 forward scored 12 of the
Panthers’ next 14 points as the mar-
gin went up to 15, 66-51.

Despite Vaughan’s rediscovery of
the bottom of the net, Chipman
credits Allen with getting Pitt back
on track for its second win in as
many games.

“The key of the game wasn't
Clyde; the key was George Allen’s
play," he said. “His two baskets and
steals were the spark that got us
ahead by ten.”

An area of concern for Chipman
was in the rebounding department,
particularly on the defensive boards.
Even though Pitt outrebounded
Lafayette 36-33, the Leopards were
getting easy baskets as forwards
Gary Bennett, who had 14 points
and 14 rebounds, and Chet Bright-
ful, who led Lafayette with 20
points, were getting inside of the
Panther front line.

An excuse could have been inten-
sity since Lafayette was more fired
up than Pitt with Chipman‘s return
to Lafayette, where he was 60-28 in
his three years as head coach in
Easton.

“It wasn’t an easy game,” Chip-
man said. “Lafayette had a lot of
intensity, more than what we had. I
hope the problem was intensity; they
were beating us on the boards badly.
When we checked their men, we
didn‘t jump and when we jumped,

, we didn‘t check."

Another advantage the Leopards
‘had was the number of players they
sent inside to rebound. The guards
were aggressively attacking the
offensive boards, but this created
problems when Pitt came up with
the ball.

“It hurt them sometimes," Chip-
man said. “We got some easy fast
break baskets.”

The Panthers created the atmos-
phere for Lafayette’s comeback late
in the first half. After leading by as
many as 12 points, some poor shot
selections by Allen and Vaughan in
the last minute gave the Leopards an
opportunity to score two free throws
by reserve center Karl Klinger and a
Brightful layup with five seconds
left, cutting the lead to 36-28.

“We got off to a good start, only
to let the game slip away at the end
of the first half,” Chipman said. “We
took two bad shots in the last min-
ute. We could have been up by l2 or
l4 points at halftime instead of
eight."

But any coach will take a victory
on the road, especially the Panthers,
who only won three games away
from the Fitzgerald Field House last
season.

“We won the game, and that’s the
important thing,“ Chipman said.
“Anytime you win on the road, it‘s a
plus."

Tomorrow night, the Panthers

as they host Indiana University of
Pennsylvania,.a.Division 11 school.
The big Indians have been unfortu-

nate so for this young season, as they

am 0-2, _l0s_ing by large margins to
West Virginia (73-46) and Penn

‘ not have a player scoring in double

figures‘.

“Even if a Division I team were
facing the opening schedule we have,
it would be tough," IUP’s first-year

coach Tom Beck said. “You have to
space them out.”

Beck realizes, however, that fac-
ing such competition will benefit
IUP ‘later on this season, when it
enters conference play.

“When you face three quality pro-
grams, it helps your program out,"
he said. “I he players look ‘forward
to going against such well-coached
teams. They’ve realized the differen-
ces between Division I and Division
II basketball.”

Special To The Pitt News
Offensive tackle Bill Fralic of
Pitt, offensive guards Doug
Dawson of Texas and Dean
Steinkuhler of Nebraska and
defensive tackle Reggie White of
Tennessee have been selected as
finalists for the l983 Lombardi
“College Lineman of the Year"!
_Award.

Reggl  ams’ if

The four players were chosen
from the crop of 1983 collegiate
linemen based on voting by a
I58-member national selection
committee of college football
coaches, sports writers and
sportscasters. Except for Fralic,
all are seniors.

They will attend the l4th
annual Lombardi Award dinner
with their coaches on Dec. 8 at
Houston’s Shamrock Hilton,
where the winner will be
announced. Over 1,000 guests
will attend to find out who will
receive the'40-lb. block of granite
trophy as the top collegiate line-
man of the ‘83 season.

Former Pittsburgh Steeler
wide receiver Lynn Swann will
emcee the event, and Merlin
Olsen, a Los Angeles Rams de-
fensive tackle-turned-NBC-TV
pro commentator, is a featured
speaker.

Each respective coach
obviously believes for his own
reasons why his player should
receive the Lombardi.

The Pitt News, Friday, December 2, 1983

Fralic Headlines Lombardi Candidate Cast

“[He] not only is an excellent

blocker on both the run and the _,

pass but is just so aggressive he’s
not satisfied with merely keeping
his man out of the play,” head
coach Foge Fazio said ofthe 6-5,
290-lb. Fralic.

Dawson, at 6-3, 267 lbs., is a
three-year starter ‘for the Long-
horns and was chosen All-
Southwest in 1982. “Dawson is
outstanding in every kind ofway:
exceptional quickness, size and
strength,” Texas head coach
Fred Akers said. “A great com-
petitor and student, he's quality
both as a man and a player.”

Not far from his hometown of
Burr, Neb., Steinkuhler is the
Cornhuskers’ fastest lineman
ever (offensive or defensive) with
a 4.67-second 40. “[He] is awe-
some at making key holes,”
Nebraska skipper Tom Osborne
said of the 6-3, 275-lb. Stein-
kuhler, also an offensive co-
captain.

With senior running back
Mike Rozier a Heisman Trophy
candidate, Nebraska could score

a double victory for an offense
that is No. I in the nation in rush-
ing and scoring offense.

White, a 6-5, 264-lb. native of
Chattanooga, Tenn., was named
both AP and UPI Lineman of
the Week after the Volunteers
defeated Louisiana State earlier
this season.

“Reggie is the most dominat-
ing lineman I’ve been around in
27 years of coaching,“ Tennessee
head coach Johnny Majors said.

Past winners of the coveted
Lombardi are Dave Rimington
(Nebraska, 1982); Kenneth Sims
(Texas, 1981); Hugh Green(Pitt,
l980); Brad Budde (Southern
Cal, I979); Bruce Clark (Penn
State, 1978); Ross Browner
(Notre Dame, I977); Wilson
Whitley (Houston, I976); Lee
Roy Selmon (Oklahoma, l975);
Randy White (Maryland, I974);
John Hicks (Ohio State, 1973);
Rich Glover (Nebraska, 1972);
Walt Patulski (Notre Dame,
I971); and Jim Stillwagon (Ohio
State, I970).

Defense

continued from page twenty four

Linebacker: Think about it, and
it‘s pretty frightening. Both Troy
Benson and Caesar Aldisert will
complete their junior years l-2 in
tackles (currently I52 and I46,
respectively), have six interceptions,
six sacks and they still return for

1984. 1’.

Hardly twins by appearance, Ben-
son and Aldisert are equally adept at

stopping the run or fading back for‘

the pass. Evidence the West Virginia
game, when Aldisert recorded three
of 10 Jeff Hostetler sacks and added
24 tackles. Evidence thetwo i‘nter-
ceptions he had against Louisville
and the two by Benson against Notre
Dame. And Benson’s 13 tackles for
losses are a season high so far. Right
out of a Maas mold, give each an A.

Secondary: Phase I is just about
completed. After losing Lewis and
Short last year, this year’s crew of
Tom Flynn, Troy Hill, Ray Wea-
therspoon and Melvin Dean fared
well in terms of transition. A second
round of integration will arise next
year when the cornerback Hill and
safety Flynn file for pro draft
selections. A

Not only did the All-America can-
didate Flynn tie Wenglikowski in
tackles (96), but he aided in Pitt’s
relinquishing a stingy eight passing
touchdowns all year. But there must
be some accountability for that
increase in total offense. The four
like to think of themselves as a fam-
ily, so award them a B-.

There has to be a certain amount
of satisfaction to defensive coordi-
nator Bob Junko, in his first season
since leaving the Lone Star State
and Texas Christian. Across the
board, earlier in the fall, there really
wasn’t enough depth to fill an
Olympic-sized swimming pool.

Now the defense has to keep from
drowning in talent.

Said Junko, “The whole time of it}

there has been a team concept
involved. This is the first time I’ve
ever been around such a team con-
cept, and Foge has done a great job
holding us together and making all
the players believe in themselves.”

Lest it be forgotten, Fazio, a Pitt
linebacker in the late ’50s, was line-
backer coach and defensive coordi-
nator since l977, before becoming
head coach.

“This football team deserves a lot

of credit,” Junko remarked, “and:_,€

Foge deserves credit for what the
team has done this year. For one
thing, the negative things in the
beginning didn’t help, but it helped
[the defense] since we’re a young
ballclub and need emotion to play

good ball. ”

 Still Trial And Error For Lady Panthers

By scorr DELLETT

The experiments to find the right
combination, both offensively and
defensively, continue for the 2-1 Pitt
women’s basketball team as it pre-
pares to face Central State, a Div-
ision II school from Wilberforce,
Ohio, tomorrow night at 5:45 p.m.
in the Field House.

Head coach Judy Saurer has a’
sketchy report on Central, but she’ll
know the team better after tonight's
game against Robert Morris.

“I know they are a quick team and
rebounding is their strength,” she
said. “They are a short team —~ the
biggest girl is 5-10 - but they have
the ability to jump.”

Relays

By scorr DELLETT

After a week’s absence from com-
petition —- perhaps to savor the 3-0
start in dual meet competition as
much as the holidays -— the Pitt
women’s swimming team returns to
action today as they participate in
the Penn State Relays.

This meet is unlike a dual meet
because there are no individual
events; even the diving events are
scored as relays. Powers such as host
Penn State and North Carolina,
fourth in the nation last year and has
winners of the meet for three years in
a row, will participate.

“This is a different type of meet,"
head coach David Belowich said.
“There is a different type of atmos-
phere, which is good for the team.”

With the number of quality teams
swimming, Belowich is not sure if
the team will improve on its fourth-
place finish. Nonetheless he does
expect a fine performance from the
squad.

“New teams like Texas A&M and
William & Mary will create a differ-
ent scoring scheme,” he said. “Every
school has different types of relay
teams. You can‘t control what they
do, but we can control what we do.”

Belowich expects some national
qualifying times, both in the five
relay events which are in the NCAA
Championships (the 200- and 400-
yard medley relay and the 200-, 400-
and 800-yard freestyle relay) and in
individual events, as the times of the
first leg in the relay can qualify for
nationals.

According to Belowich, the train-

-‘ ing regime for a relay meet changes

slightly from the typical dual meet
preparation.

“You have to work more on the
relay takeoffs and starts," he said.
“We have more specific workouts,
more speed work, and we work on
the finer points, like turns. But we
still focus on individual goals, on
what they have to do and the kind of
times they have to swim."

With the depth the Lady Panthers
have, chances are good that Pitt will
find success in all relays, including
the breaststroke and butterfly
relays, events not swam in dual
meets or championship competi-
tion.

“We have the luxury of having
versatile swimmers," Belowich said.
“We are strong in every relay."

Of course, Pitt has been practicing
for Central State’s strength, working
especially on boxing out the oppo-
nent from the basket. What defense
the Lady Panthers employ, how-
ever, will depend on how well Cen-
tral shoots. Against Youngstown
State, Pitt used a pressure man-to-
man defense to disrupt the Penguins’
guard-oriented offense.

“First, we have to see if they have
consistent shooters,” Saurer said. “I
would like to mix up defenses.”

Defense has been on what the
Lady Panthers have concentrated.
Now Saurer would like to work on
the offense and have other players,
besides forward Jennifer Bruce,
score consistently.

   EVERYTHING voii Aiwiivs
    INABEER‘

“Offense is one of the areas we are
trying to refine,” Saurer said. “We
didn’t get into the flow because of
the number of players we used. We
need to become more comfortable
with any lineup.”

The guard spot has shown signs of
being a threat. Lisa Fubio scored 15
points against Indiana Saturday,
but only came upiwith a four-point
performance in Tuesday’s win. Kim
Tirik nearly matched her output for
two games with a 12-point game
against Youngstown State. Ste-
phanie Collins is acknowledged by
Saurer as being the squad’s best
shooter. .

“We have established the inside
game,” Saurer said, “but it is not
always going to be there.”

Fubio’s shooting performance
against Youngstown State — one
for seven from the field -— can be
explained. A broken finger on her
non-shooting left hand has signifi-
cantly affected her.

“In practice, she may favor her
hand,” Saurer said. “We just have to
wait and see how she does."

The Lady Panthers were boosted
by a 12-point performance by
reserve forward Ellen Gilhooney. If
Gilhooney, a starter in Pitt’s first
two games, can continue to perform
as well offensively as Tuesday night
—- four for seven from the field —

this will alleviate the pressure on

Bruce.
“Ellen didn’t shoot well against
Indiana,” Saurer said. “She was

missing wide-open shots. She made.
amends against Youngstown State.
She has been spending extra time on
her shooting. Hopefully, that will
help.”

If the Lady Panthers are to be as
successful this season as in the past,
the entire team has to perform.

Said Saurer, “We need them all.
There’s no question about it.”

PEACE

Let this be the year it
all comes together
with brotherly love.

The two heavies took a 2-2 tie into
the third period, but Joseph
remained in control the duration of
the match to accumulate a riding-
time advantage, which gave him the
final one-point edge.

“We did have some good matches,
but for the most part, I wasn‘t very
happy," Stottlemyer said. “If we had
wrestled a better team, we may have
lost. The main problem was that the
guys dropped to the level of compe-
tition that they were wrestling,

INSIGHTS

  A INTO
STUDENT GOVERNMENT

Paid Advertisement

  

\

\

< ‘Spotlight

—Darci O’Hare

This term’s final. SPO-
TLIGHT is dedicated to a
three-year veteran of Student
Government who has never
seen the glories and tribula-
tions of attention in the spo-
tlight. She is not on the
prestigious Student Govern-
ment Board, an austere

‘ appointee to the Allocations

Committee.

Her name is Pat Guardino.
She .is the editor of
INSIGHTS and the Student
Relations Committee has
nicknamed her “Purple Pat”
for her passion for purple
clothing.

Pat is often seen bustling
into the Student Govern-
ment office to take care of
committee business or
hyper-typing before newslet-
ter deadlines. She is very effi-
cient and can always be
counted on to write articles,
help with lay-outs or proof-
read copy.

Pat claims she has never
had the desire to be in the
limelight, preferring the

behind the scenes much
more.

“Commuting can cut you
off from the mainstream of
campus life,” Pat explains,
“but my involvement in Stu-
dent Government has helped
me meet people.

“When I started Pitt, I
didn’t know what I wanted to

» do,” Pat said, “but working as
co-editor of Magic Bus and
now editor of Insights has
helped to mold a career direc-
tion for me.”

Pat is a communications

major and will graduate this I

December. She hopes to
work in the field of print pro-
duction and she feels her
experience in Student
Government has helped to
prepare her for this.

We will miss “Purple Pat”
but feel confident that her val-
uable contributions to the
Student Relations Commit-
tee and all of Student
Government will pay off for
her in the experience that she
has gained.

 

Mark Downs: A Leader’s Reﬂection

——Athena Zaras

As the year comes to a
close so does the presidential
term of Student Government
Board president Mark
Downs. I was assigned to
interview him on his reflec-
tions of SGB 1983, but in
doing so, I not only learned
something about Mark, I was
also enlighteded on some
interesting concepts of Stu-
dent Government.

Mark Downs, a senior eco-
nomics/ business major and a
member of Delta Tau Delta
fraternity has whole-
heartedly commited himself
this year to his office of presi-
dent. Mark stated that “It’s
been a prosperous year for
SGB and the members, over-
all, interacted well. At times
there was a lack of communi-
cation, but the members
worked openly and honestly

with each other.”

Mark stated that some of

SGB’s accomplishments
included the Grand Opening
suitcase party, a search com-
mittee formed for Student
Board of Trustees member,
and a campus—wide effort to
reinstate
Office to full-time status.

the Internship

Although the necessary

time commitment to Student

Government made budget-

ing study time difficult, there

were benefits which included
learning how to work with

‘ prople of all ages, his peers

along with those in the higher
ranks of administration.
Furthermore, Mark went
on th state, “The only people
who don’t take Student
Government seriously are
the students themselves, and
that’s a shame because the
administration views the Stu-
dent Government Board with

no shut doors to any prob-
lems the students might
have.” He went on to com-
ment, “Even though the
media sometimes distorted
the efforts of Student
Government its’s rewarding
to know that the efforts of the
Board were of paramount
value to the students of Pitt.”

Mark hopes “The new
board and the president will
increase the general student
body’s interest and involv-
ment in Student Govern-
ment. ~

Thank you Mark for your
concern and dedication to
the students here at the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh. I hope
the students of this campus
realize -that the Student
Government Board’s efforts
are for the benefit of the stu-
dent population here at Pitt.

In-House Open House

-—Dan Vuic

Ken Stram, newly elected

SGB President for 1984 was ,

pleased with the turnout of an
informal open house held
Monday, Nov. 28. Stram
initiated the entire event to
acquaint new SGB and Allo-
cations members with the
current members of Student
Government.

This was by no means a
social event—it was more of a
learning experience. Veteran
board members offered
advice to the newcomers of
the board.

Jeff Schaffer, current SGB
member said to the newly
appointed Allocations
members, “Become familiar
with the written Allocations
policies..tdon’t always rely on
precedence.”

“Select several projects to

pursue so that if one falls
through there are alterna-
tives to resort to...get to
know your fellow SGB

members,” was Schaffer’sl

advice to the new Student
Government Board, which
seemed to sum up the advice
offered by the rest of the SGB
members.

“Problems arise due to a
lack of communication,” said
Steve Smith, Allocations
chairman. This was not the
case though, at the in-house.
The 1984. Student Govern-
ment Board and the Alloca-
tions Committee seem to be
off to a good start.
