Editorial

No caffeine still
not a buzzkill

jove over, mixed drinks
and beer. Some drink-
. ers, particularly young-

er adults, want their alcohol with
some extra kick in it, and no, not
necessarily copious amounts of
sugar. They prefer drinks that
combine alcohol and caffeine.
These drinks might not be as
common amid college parties as
keg beer, but according to a study

from Wake Forest University, more ‘

than a quarter of college kids reach
for the caffeinated cans when they
party. But now there are concerns
over their safety. .
Recently, the Food and Drug

' Administration told nearly 30

manufacturers that they need to
provide scientiﬁc evidence that

their beverages that combine -

alcohol and caffeine are safe to
consume. Caffeine is not on the
FDA’s list of ingredients that can
be legally added to alcohol in a
manufactured beverage, accord-
ing to an article from MedPage
Today. The FDA has not formerly
approved these beverages on the
market.

We’re all quite familiar with the
health detriments and side effects
of drinking alcohol, and there’s
concern that the caffeine — a
stimulant — in these drinks masks
the alcohol’s —— a depressant —— in-
toxicating effects. While the body
normally becomes fatigued after
alcohol consumption, the caffeine
counteracts this effect, leaving the
body in a state that’s twice as un-
natural as normal condition.

Yet caffeine-laden alcohol could
also cause the drinker to underes-
timate his level of intoxication and
further distort his already clouded
judgment /— an obviously danger-
ous effect.
V The manufacturers were given
30 days to show their drinks are
safe, otherwise the FDA could
take them off the market. Already
some beverage producers nixed‘
caffeine-alcohol products from
their lineup after taking pres-
sure from attorney generals from
over a dozen states -— last year,
‘Anheuser-Busch eliminated caf-
feine from its beverages Bud Ex-
, tra and Tilt. MillersCoors. agreed.
to pull Sparks — a dri'nkthat’s
can imitated the appearance of
traditional, non-alcoholic energy
drinks -'— off the market.
Assuming this investigation
results in the ‘elimination of caf- _
feine—laced alcohol products from
store shelves, drinkers would still
be free to make their own non-
manufactured mixes. For example,
Red Bull is popularly mixed with
vodka. And what about Jager—
bombs? It’s undoubtedly easier to
pull a few products off the shelves
than to implement a blanket ban
at bars, restaurants and clubs, but
the government might attempt to
target these concoctions next. ’
We’ll get our caffeine ﬁx the
next morning, anyway, with coffee,
the age-old hangover deterrent
— too bad that’s as scientiﬁcally
effective at ﬁghting hangovers as

cold showers. "

Julien Maire re-imagines media processes as art

Kathryn Beaty
Staff Writer

“Matter and Memory” .
Julien Maire

Wood Street Galleries
601 Wood St.

’ 412-471-5605

Art possesses the ability not only
to create, but also to deconstruct the
world.

Berlin—based French installation ‘

artist Julien Maire deconstructs au-
diovisual media processes and then
re—irnagines these media in a simple,’
provocative manner that questions
the way people’s perception of reality
operates. In his U.S. debut at Wood
Street Galleries, Maire experiments
with forms of projection and creates a
dialogue between the worlds of analog
and digital media.

His work “Exploding Camera” re-
irnagines the reality of Sept. 11 through
the eyes of Cmdr. Massoud, an oppo-

nentto the Taliban killed two days ear— ’

lier by two al—Qaida suicide bombers
posing as journalists. A video camera
that Maire took apart and video dis-
plays project—irnagined memories of
this momentthatwas overshadowed by
the events of Sept; 11. Byreinterpreting
a historic event through a destroyed
medium, Maire challenges reality and
its memory.

Murray Horne, curator of Wood

StreetGalleries,ﬁrstdiscovered Maire’s

’ workwhenhesawhisliveperfonnance

“Digit’ ’two years ago inEurope. “Digit”
shows Maire sittingatadesk, andas he
slides his hand across a piece of blank
paper, printed text mysteriously ap-
pears. The audience can come close to.
the writer, who remains absorbedinhis
task. Maire also performed this work

— for his Wood Street Galleries opening.

This is the ﬁrst North American
show for Maire, whose performances
and installations have been displayed
around the world — from Ars Elec-
tronica in Linz, Austria, to Sculpture
Space in Shanghai, China. Anartiston
the rise, Maire’s collective body ofwork
was recently nominated at the “World
Technology Awards” in New York.

Home explained that the gallery
focuses on showcasing new media by
artists on the rise and that often these
works are visually and sonically con-
frontational. Horne said that Maire’s
workprovidedadiiferentviewpoint on
new media than is usually seen.

“This show is more introspective,”
Horne said, “andis perceived between
the eyes and the mind as the mind is
tryingto registerwhat it sees. Itis more
contemplative and demanding.”

‘ Like “Digit,” much of Maire’s work
possesses an intriguing air of mystery
that provokes the curiosity of the audi-
ence and challenges people to explore
and look closer. Horne says that the
experience ofthe show depends heavily
upon the inquiring mind of the viewer

andhis or her desire to look closely and
explore.

In one work, Maire explores the
relationship between analog and digi-
tal media by simplifying back to the
zoetrope, one of the earliest forms of
moviemaking that works similarly to
animation. On ﬁrst glance, the work
appears to project digital ﬁlm images
onto large screens on the opposite
side of the room. A close look inside
the workings ofthe projector, however,
will reveal these are not projections of
images but of physical objects. Maire
has created glass shapes and rigged
them to rotate inside the projector as
they are projected.

Maire deconstructs and then re-
works all of the media in his shows by
hand, creating an intimate, physical
relationship with the machine aspects
of ﬁlm. —

‘°I‘he showfeelsveryFrench,”Home
said. “Itallworks within the mind. You
know that the artisthas been working
on a small, microscopic process.”

The hands-on attention to detail is
stunning and challenges the viewer to

V look at the works with a similar atten-

tion to detail The exhibition encour-
ages its viewers to participate in the
works and create new forms of their
own. One work invites viewers to play
with shavings from ball bearings as
their movements are projected onto a
monitor. Maire challenges the audience
to joinhiminactively re—imaginingthe
reality of the world. _

The 3 best ‘A ChristmasCarol’s in the last 30 years

Tybout deconstructs the role Charles Dickens’ classic tale has played in modern cinema

Andy Tybout
Columnist

A little more than 150 years ago, one
the world’s greatest writers penned a
novella about an old, hardened soul
ﬁndingkindnessinhumanitybeforeiﬁs
too late. Now, all across the country, we
tellthe storyto ourchildren and grand-
children through literature, musicals
and movies — even VH1 specials.
What Leonard Cohen’s “Hallelu-
jah” is to music, Charles Dickens’ “A
Christmas Carol” is to ﬁlm — a work
that’s been covered enough times that
it’slostalmostallofits appeal. Thereare
“Carols”forDickenslovers,“Caro ’for
Cynics, “Carols” for families, “Carols”
for people who don’t like Christmas

carols and, most recently, “Carols” for
people who enjoy creepy performance-
capture technology.

just look at this year’s releases: the
previously alluded—to Robert Zemeckis’

. “A Christmas Carol” and MarkWaters’

“Ghosts ofGirlfriends Past.”That’s two
new takes on the story in the span of
oneyear. AndwhileIhaven’tseen either
of them, their trailers were enough to
convince me oftheir suffocati_nglame—
rress.

Now, I know you must be think-
ing, “Ilove ‘A Christmas Carol,’ but I
hate terrible remakes. If only someone
had a list of the top three ‘Christmas
Carol’ movies so Iwouldn’t have to silt
throughallthat crap ...”

Well, you’re in luck. I happen to
possess afoolprooﬂistofthe topthree

contemporary “Christmas Carol” ad-
aptations since 1970.

3) “A Christmas Carol” (1984),
starring George C. Scott. This is the
ﬁ.mdamentalist’s “Christmas Carol”
— a movie that takes Dickens’ each
and every word literally, as if attempt-
ing some History Channel recreation
of reality. But its strength lies not in its
impeccable reading, butinits Ebenezer
Scrooge: George C. Scott, aka Gen.
Patton, aka All-Around Man’s Man.
Scott exudes an austere cold that the
real Scrooge would admire. Even his
muttonchops are sinister. This is that
rare rnade-for-TV movie that actually
trumps most of its cinematic counter-
parts in quality.

2) “Scroog ” (1988), starring Bill
Murray. Murrayhas always been one of

my favorite comedic actors, and here
he makes ahurnorous, iflessthanevil,
Ebenezer Scrooge (or, inthisﬁlm, Frank
Cross). This is one of those “modern”
takes on “A Christmas Carol,” where
Marley is a media mogul, the Ghost
of Christmas Past is a cab driver, and
the Ghost of Christmas Future is the
craziest thing you’ll ever see. It’s by no
means a perfect movie, but in terms
of adaptations, it’s at the high end of
enjoyability. »
1) “The Muppet Christmas Carol”
(1992), starring Michael Caine. Too
often, people worry about making an
“authentic” Christmas Carol, which
usually means a dark, morose, ﬁrnless

affair. Director Brian Henson knew,

better. From the sets to the charac-
ters (both puppet and human) to the

memorable song numbers, this movie
delights in the story rather than wor-
ships it. And Caine is arguably the best
Scrooge ever — I’ve never seen a man
hurl a puppet to the ground with such
iron abandon.

The fact of the matter is, this is
by far my favorite “Christmas Carol,”

and even if theymade a better one, I

wouldn’t admit it, because I grew up
with this one. So if you don’t trust me
-— the obstinate movie critic —— trust
me the uncorrupted little kid:This isthe
one thatwill make you excitedtowake
up on Christmas morning again.

You’re welcome to ignore this list
atyour own risk.Just don’t come com-
plaining to me when your Christmas
is ruined by the “Alvin and the Chip-
munks”version.

Pitt defeats Notre Dame with help from its defense

Adam Littman
Assistant Sports Editor

Opening up the second quarter, Notre

‘ Damefacedathird—and-16fromitsown

7-yard line with the Pitt football team
clingingto a 3-0 lead. With the Fighting
Irish inahuddle, the bigscreenatHeinz
Field showed various members of the
Panther defensive line nodding along
with Trick Daddy’s “Let’s G0,” which
was playing throughout the stadium.

Clearly, the Panthers weren’t intimi-
dated by Notre Dame, which features
one of the nation’s top quarterbacks in
juniorjimmy Clausen, arguablythe best
receiving duo in college football with
Golden Tate and Michael Floyd and an
offensive line compromised entirely
of seniors. .

“We’re not going to shy away from
anybody,” defensive tackle Gus Mus-
takassaid. _ »

, It showed in Pitt’s 27-22 victory
Saturday night, as the Panther de-
fense spent nearly as much time in the
backﬁeldas Clausen. The Panthers put
pressure. on the quarterback all night,
allowinghimtothrowforjust283 yards.
He came into the game averaging 308
passingyards a gamethisyear. '

“Sometimes good pressure from a
pass rushcanbebetterthanasack,”Pitt
coach Dave Wannstedt said. “You get
interceptions and incomplete passes
off of good pressure.”

The Panthers picked off one Clausen
pass, abeautiﬁil over-the—shou1dergrab

byfreshmanjarred Holley, who hauled
in the slightly overthrown pass while
diving backward.

Occasionally, Pitt didn’tjustgetpres—
sure on Clausen, but sacked him. The
Panthers addedtotheir nation—best 39
sacks with two more against the Irish.
The three sacks are actually below Pitt’s
4.1—sacks-per—game average. The next
highest teams, Oklahoma and Texas
Tech, average 3.3 sacks per game.

“When going against a great quar-
terback, a smart quarterback, like

[Clausen], you’re not goingto get many
sacks,” Mustakas said.

The two sacks are on parwith what
Notre Dame usually gives up. Coming
into the game, the Irish gave up 19 sacks
intheirﬁrstnine games. Defensive end

Jabaal Sheard said Notre Damehas one
ofthe best offensive lines inthe countiy,
but the Panthers weren’t concerned
going up against them, because Pitt
“can match up against anybody. I don’t
doubt us against any offensive line in
the country.” A

The pressure provided by the
Pitt defensive line caused Clausen to
throw on the run outside the pocket
all night.

“Pitt’s defensive ends gaveus alotof
pressure, whichforcedjimmy Clausen
to step up. He was under heat all game
long,” Notre Dame coach Charlie Weis
said. “We called four screens. It didn’t
work for us because they were able to
get their hands up and that took away
from our effectiveness on offense.”

While the Panthers’ defense domi— V

natedtheﬁrstthree quarters, givingup
just three points, Notre Dame picked
things up in the fourth, scoring 19
points. Trailing 27-22 with less than
three minutes left, the Irish gotthe ball
back afteraPitIpunt. Notre Darne’s two
previous fourth- quarter drives resulted
in touchdowns, and after completing
his ﬁrst three passes on this drive, it

No, NFL ofﬁcials put the kibosh on
Celek’s celebration when they learned
thatcaptain Morgan’s parent company,
Diageo, planned aviral marketing cam-
paignwhere therumdistributorwould
donate money to charity each time
player struck the pose. ‘ '

There’s a lesson to be learned here,
Brent. Ifyou want to promote a brand
during your touchdown celebrations,

A promote the right brand.

The oﬂicial beerofthe NFL, Brent, is
Coors Light.  The next time
you pick up your blocking assignment
on ablitzinglinebacker, mkeamoment
toserenadeMcNabbwitl1tl1ebeercom-
pany’s “Wrngman” song. "

“I’m taking one for the team,” you
will sing. “So my buddy can rtm the
screen. Wngrnan!”

Later, Brent, you can crack open

your IBM laptop with its new, 1ong-last-

inglitl1ium—ion batterytechnology and I

splice together some press conference
clips ofleague oﬂicials reactingto your
celebration. The humorous 30-second
video will nm every Sunday.

If the Philadelphia Eagles make it
pasttheNFC Championship gamethis
year, Brent, rememberthatAnheuser-
Buschisthe ofﬁcialbeer sponsor ofth
Super BowL ‘

Have some Clydesdales pull you
around in abuggy during the 40-min-
ute pregame ceremony. At halftime,
sing “Real Men of Genius” witl1lBon
Jovi, honoring Mr. No-Spill Lid Inven-
tor Guy. ,

Ifyou win the Super Bowl, Brent,
don’t forget to proclaim, “I’rn going to
Disneyland!”

” Disneyhas adealwitl1theNFLto
work this into every Super Bowl post-
game celebration, andyou’d better not

disappoint Mickey Mouse. 1 don’t care
if you want to go to Legoland.

Even ifyorfrelosingthegame, dump
some Gatorade on coach Andy Reid
before the ﬁnal whistle blows. It’s re-
freshing, energizingandashade of deep
purple. Make sure you hold the cooler
so the cameras can catch the lightning
bolt logo.

Just don’t do what Chicago Bears
linebacker Brian Urlacher did.
p Two years ago, Urlacher received

' a $100,000 ﬁne for wearing a Vita-

minwater hat during Super Bowl XLI’s
media day because the brand was not
an oﬂicial sponsor of the NFL. That’s
not G, Brian. That’s not even close to
being G.

Coca- Cola owns Vitarninwater,

Brian, and you should know by now .

that Pepsi is the official soft drink of
the NFL. That means no polar bears,
no Meanjoe Greene and deﬁnitely no

nostalgia. Thinkyoung. .

Too many players are makingsirn-
ple mistakes.

Joe Hom’s ﬁne for his 2003 cell
phone celebration didn’t happen be-
cause it was an excessive celebration.
He used a TracFone. Verizon, Joe. Ve
rizon.

Terrell Owens knows what he’s do-
ing. Brent, Brian,]oe, you guys need to
learn from him. '

Remember the 2002 Sharpie inci-
dent, when he pulledamarkerfmmhis

Best place to get arresteriz Towers

Normally Towers Patio is a laid-back place.

‘ Knots of freshmen lounge on benches and
tables, smoking hookahs and strumming
Music waits from open dorrn—room windows as
foot traffic streams around groups of laughing,
carefree college students.

Normally, Towers Patio is a great place to be,
but on the night of Sept. 25, the place took on a
slightly different feel.

That night students ranfromthe benches and
tables as officers wearing riot gear stormed the "pa-
tio, shatteringthe friendly atmosphere. Multiple
students were arrested within feet of the lobby
doors and charged with failure to disperse.

, Voted the best place to get arrested on cam-
pus, Towers Patio will be remembered for years
to come as the sight of a major confrontation

between Pitt students and G-20 police forces.

How about seeing your favorite guitar player
rip through a face-melting solo live from 10 feet

How about hearing him shred while you re-

the power of the rock gods?

Voted the best music venue in Pittsburgh,
Mr. Smalls Pimhouse in Millvale lets you do just
that.

strapped concert—goer can watch the likes of
Snoop Dogg, Fall Out Boy and Ziggy Marley play

verted from an 18th-century Catholic church six

Best place to smoke: Towers Patio

Looking for a mid—afternoon cig, but don’t
want to disturb your roommate or risk a ﬁre
hazard?

Grab your friendjoe Camel and head to Tow-
ers Patio, where you can experience the classiest
of campus class.

Sure, onelookatthe not—so—comfypat1'o tables
reveals that it’s no smoking lounge. But what the
Patio lacks in couture, it makes up for in enter-
tainrnentvalue.

Feel free to stare down those freshmen as
they sprint to class with weighty backpacks and
lanyard-ed IDs — the old “freshman leash,” as
many call them.

Check out the swankyT—shi11;s, cute cacti and
cheap goldﬁsh that student clubs are selling.

Make faces at a passing Pathﬁnder tour or

a simply take in the sweet melodies blasting from

a ﬁindraiser in the Quad.

Enjoy the many sights, sounds and (occasion-
ally) smells of the great campus outdoors, but
take warning: No smoking on the Patio — or
being there at all, for that matter — during late-

Breakfast might be the most important meal
of the day, but lunch is arguably the most exciting
one. The possibilities for meal choices arevarious
and endless. Ifyou crave fresh bread, ‘soups and
salads, then there is no better place than Panera
Bread. This gem of a bakery-café hybrid is located
on the Forbes Avenue strip with NewBa1anoe and
Rue 21 and prides itselfon its service offood made

with quality ingredients. '

Many coifeeﬁanchises existinthe world, butthere
is clearly only one Starbucks. The business might
come under ﬁre from time to time about what
some consider to be inﬂated prices, but nothing
has stopped this business’ meteoric rise to famed,‘
that started in the 1990s.

V The famous green banner, mysterious mer-
maid-like logo and signature smell of the café’s

campus at the intersection of Forbes Avenue and
Atwood Street.

Though you must participate infour experi-
ments to receive credit, Pitt’s Intro to Psychol-
ogy class is a good place to learn why men and
women will never understand each other. It’s
also where you’ll discover as afreshman that you
are motivated by sex, as Freud’s theory suggests,
just in case you didn’t already know.

For thousands of years, people have strived
to understand the innerworkings of the human
mind. But if these concepts aren’t related to
your major, you might ﬁnd it alittle hard to stay
awake. Maybe you’re tired because you had an
important paper due in another class. Maybe you

spentallyour time irrationally surﬁngFacebook
instead of ﬁnishing your work at a reasonable 7
hour. So you dutifully attend class, but you fall
asleep and miss the part where the professor
explains why people procrastinate.

Make no mistake, college is hard, and every-
body needs to do somethingfun once in awhile
to forget about exams and term papers. Pitt
Program Council has your back. This student-
run organization consistently organizes events
at Pitt, such as pep rallies, Homecomingfestivi—
ties, movie screenings, lectures with celebrities
suchas Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban and
Duff Goldman from “Ace of Cakes,” aswell as live
bands such as Cute Is What We Aim For. Add in

sponsored trips to Cedar Point, New York and 

Panama City, and itbecomes apparent that you
never haveanexcuseto be bored at school. Ifthis
wasn’t enough already, PPC also offers a book
scholarship to a highly involved student who
needs help payingfor textbooks. If this all sounds
too good to be true, then check for yourself at
its website at www.pitt.edu/~ppc/.

Atlanta might have its pandas, but the Oak-
land Zoo is the only place where you can ﬁnd
giant ﬁirry apes, Winnie the Pooh look—a—likes
and 1,500 of the rowdiest Panthers this side of
the watering hole. The often sold-out section
keeps fans energized with decibe1—shattering
cheers, larger—than—life personalities and enough
jumping to promise an excellent calf workout.
In 2006, Sports Illustrated credited the Pete
as the “toughest place to play” in the Big East,
thanks to the Zoo’s creative means of distracting
opponents — think synchronized arm—waving
during free throws. The Zoo has garnered the
praise of The Wall StreetJoumal,'ESPN’s “Col—
lege Basketball GameDay” broadcasts and even
Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban. But when
it comes to praise for the Zoo’s intensity, perhaps
none resonates louder than that ofESPN basket-

approach to food systems. You'll study how food, from farm to table to
compost, affects us and our global environment. The curriculum connects

food politics, history and culture, and food markets and marketing.

College has become increasingly important,

but it’s expensive. So what’s better than going to
college? Not having to pay for it yourself. That’s

 

   

right, letting your parents pick up the tab. While
letting your ’rents get the bill might cause them
to take an interest in certain parts of your college
life, like grades, it’s worth it in the end. It’s nice
to know that you can always call home for alittle
more “textbook” money. Don’tworry, Mom, that

During tough economic times, one free
commodity remains -sacred: the T—shirt. You
probably received one when you moved into
your freshman residence hall — the name of the
building emblazoned on your breast pocket, just
in case anyone wondered whether Pitt’s sorting
hat placed you in Sutherland or Lothrop. More
than granting the freshmen a sense of identity,
the free T—shirt is the perfect fashion statement
on those mornings when you’ve been out late
— studying at the library, of course. Throw it
on with a pair of oversized sweatpants, and it’s
the most ﬁscal way to convey the message, “Do
not disturb.”

not skip classes to catch up on those Zs? Don’t

sleep whﬂe professors teach, and you’re not go-

riding the 54C. Making more than 10 stops on
campus, the 54C is the only bus route that con-
nects Oakland with both the South Side and the
Strip District — two popular shopping locations
in the Pittsburgh area. The route can shuttle
students to such shops as Urban Outﬁtters, Pius-
burghjean Co. and Mancini’s Bread and Wholey’s
ﬁsh market, opening up a newworld of shopping
experiences to Pitt students. So remember, the
