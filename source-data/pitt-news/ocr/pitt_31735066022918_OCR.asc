SomeLAC Members Critical ofChai

By MARY KANE
Pitt News Staff Writer ‘

The procedures ‘used by-the Stu-
dent Government Board to appoint
Dave Crissman as chairman of the
Legal Awareness Committee have

/been criticized by several LAC

members-
Under new SGB .bylaws, all
standing committee chairmen are

. appointed by an adhoc committee

consisting of three SGB members
and three non-returning members
of the standing committee. There
are faults in this procedure, accord-
ing to former LAC chairman Mary
Curiale.

By restricting adhoc committee
membership to non-returning com-

mittee members, Curiale said, the
best qualified people to judge were
not selected. V

“The most qualified members to
select the chairman weren’t the non-
returning members,” she said. The
SGB should have let the LAC
choose who it wanted on the adhoc
committee, Curiale added.

Curiale said Al Mele, and SGB

member appointed to serve on the,

adhoc selection committee, asked
her to also serve on the committee.
Curiale said Mele did not make it
clear to her that she was eligible,
and did not agree with the pro-
cedure for selecting chairman.
Acting LAC chairman Scott
Riback, also an applicant for chair-

man, said he was told to submit a
list of graduating seniors to Martin

‘Bertocchi, a SGB member of the

adhoc committee. Riback. said he
was asked by SGB member Walter
Burke to star the names of those

_committee members he believed

were most active and shouldibe on
the adhoc committee. -
“We have to assume he starred
them out of the general consensus
of the committee,” Bertocchi said.
However, the. other applicants
for chairman, Todd DeLuca and
Dave Crissman, said they and other
LAC members were unaware of
-Scott’s recommendations. _
Curiale questioned "the criteria

Piﬂ Students Active in Presidential

By TERESA SOKOL
Pitt News Staff Writer ’
As momentum grows in Pennsyl-
vania for the April 22 presidential

primary, student campaign coor-

dinators for Democrat Edward M.
Kennedy and Republican John
Anderson are gearing up to spread
the word about their respective can-
didates.

Scott Hendler is coordinating the
campus campaign for Kennedy and
Mike Langer is spreading the word
about the write-in campaign for Il-
linois’s Republican John Anderson.

Hendler and Langer agreed that
Pennsylvania will be a “keystone”

. state for their candidates but added

that a defeat in this primary would
not stop Kennedy nor Anderson
from continuing their respective
presidential campaigns.

Langer said campaigners for

, Anderson will have “their work cut

out for them” since, due to a clerical
error, Anderson’s name will not be

appearing on the primary ballot in -

Pennsylvania. A write-in campaign
is being encouraged by Anderson’s
supporters and, while Langer said

‘ that it does not look like Anderson

will receive the Republican nod_as
presidential nominee, he added that
there ‘is a high percentage of
Democrats and Republicans who
favor Anderson’s candidacy.

Langer said that the major sup-
porters of Anderson include people
who have graduated from college
during the last five to 10 years.

Langer _ has ‘been passing out
bumper stickers, pins, and informa-
tion about Anderson on campus, but
he said “few people know about him

(Anderson). He is almost as obscure
as Carter_ was four years ago.”
Anderson will bein Pittsburgh
April 18 topromote his presidential
campaign, Langer said. A
The Kennedy campaign has been
in full swing during past weeks in
Pennsylvania. Kennedy has been
speaking to crowds in Pittsburgh and

statewide about his plans for the

presidency.

On campus, Hendler and a
number of volunteers will be setting
up information tables in the Tower’s
lobby next week.

Hendler said Kennedy and his
campaigners “believe the tide -is
changing for Kennedy,” and added
that they are also planning ahead to
the California and Michigan
primaries. These states‘ and
Pennsylvania are high in electoral
votes, added Hendler. .

PUPC Makes Eighth 

Constitution Revision    

By SETH LUBOVE
Pitt News Staff Writer

After a month and numerous
revisions, the.Pitt Program Council
has finally_ decided upon the make-
up of a board of governors and a
constitution that would satisfy the
conditions stipulated by the in-
crease in the student activities fee as
passed by the Board of Trustees in
February.

The $24 student activities fee for
next year was based. on a plan
drawn up by past Student Govern-
ment Board president Stan Galah-
ski . and SGB president Bill
Abraham, authorizing three groups
toallocate funds to organizations
under their jurisdiction.

The three groups dividing up the
increase will be: The Media and
Publications Board (approximately
15 percent); The Allocations’ Com-

mittee (40 percent); and the PUPC V

Board of Governors (35 percent of
the fee or approximately $192,000).

questions along the same lines, Ber- '

ing the chairman-

“The adhoc committee overlook-
ed the qualifications of theother
applicants, especially Todd
DeLuca,” Curiale said, “What
criteria did they use to base their
decision?” She added that the
adhoc committee, should have writ-
ten a statement explaining how the
chairman was selected.

“We have a right to know how
they made their decision,” Curiale
stated.

“I don’t know. if there are
definite criteria to judge
leadership,” Bertocchi commented.
The adhoc committee came up with
a list of qualifications to judge the
applicants and asked each applicant

Campaign 

Student involvement in the Ken-
nedy ‘campaign is growing, Hendler
said, but many students are still
unaware of the campaign on cam-
pus.

Coordination activities on campus
are primarily directed toward “gain-
ing support for the Senator, and get-
ting people tovote in the primaries, ’ ’
Hendler said.

While there are’ no immediate
plans for Kennedy to speak on cam-
pus, Hendler said the Kennedy cam-
paign bus and surrogate speakers
will be here next week to acquaint
students with the Kennedy cam-
paign. -

Will Smith, a_ member of the‘Ken-

nedy family and son of ‘Kennedy -

campaign manager Steve Smith, will
be in the Student Union Lower
Lounge. "to speak on Monday,
Hendler added. * ‘ -

The proposal drawn up by SGB
had stipulated that before any fund-

ing would be granted to PUPC,

the three year PUPC contract must
be voided by the SGB, the director
of student activities and the vice

chancellor for student affairs, and

that a board of governors must be

' formed and a constitution created

to replace the contract.

, “The Pitt Union Program Coun- G

cil will devise a. constitution to in-
ciude a policy-making, budgetary
board to be representative of the
broad and -varied interests of the
Oakland campus of the University
of Pittsburgh, and shall have a
minimum of three representatives

I appointed by the Student Govern-

ment Board,” according to the pro-
posal. ‘

SGB had also required that it ap-' ..

prove the constitution, along with‘

the director of student activities and

the vice chancellor for student af-

tocchi said. _ _
Some of these qualifications in-

cluded future plans, analysis of the 
group’s problems, the adhoc com- 1

mittee interpretation of the appli-

cant’s leadership qualities, and the '_  '
applicantfs ability to interact with‘ 

the group. -

Mele said the adhoc committee '

“deliberated for over an hour bet-
ween Dave and Todd.” Mele said5

DeLuca told the committee he was-
‘ planning to run for student govern-

ment this election or the next one,
and this was a factor in choosing
Crissman over DeLuca.

  Passage of Eighth PUPC Constitution Uncertain

(Continued from Page 1)
fairs. .
A committee was then formed to
develop a constitution consisting of

‘ PUPC members Ron Story, Bill

Jackson, Lorelei Kelley, Ed Kelley,
Eric Perez, Chris Krysinski, PUPC
advisor Joyce Giangarlo, and SGB
president Bill Abraham. The con-
stitution committee met initially on
March 5, meeting each Wednesday
thereafter to come to a consensus
on the document, which would
haveto be approved by SGB.
However, consensus among the

I committee members was tenuous,

and passage of the document by
SGB is still not certain, even after
approximately eight revisions of the
constitution, the seventh of which
was turned down by SGB in last
Thursday’s meeting.

And as time wears on and the
funding for PUPC remains in lim-
bo, PUPC members are claiming
that‘ they may be losing contracts

V for next year due to “ﬁnancial and

legal obligations.” According to
PUPC chairpersons, any contracts
that they schedule for a later date
must be backed by the approximate
cash amount necessary forthe pro-
gram. They cited the possible
cancellation of a fall lecture by An-

The eighth revision of the pro-
posed PUPC constitution, drawn
up at an emergency meeting on Fri-
day afternoon between the PUPC
executive board and Martin Bertoc-
chi, Joe Blazer, Scott Hendler, and
Bill Abraham of SGB, is a six page
document declaring the philosophy
of PUPC, the composition of the
board of governors and the ex-
ecutive board and their powers and
duties, with paragraphs on financ-
ing of PUPC and procedures for
amendments to the constitution.

In addition, the roles of student
coordinator who serves as chairper-
son on the board of governors and
is selected by the executive commit-
tee and business manager who
maintains the financial records of

all PUPC committees and is also.

selected by the board of governors
are defined.

Theboard of governors, the com-
position of which is the center of
controversy between SGB and
PUPC, is’ comprised of eight
students, two of which must be ap-
pointed by the vice chancellor for
student affairs, and three non-
students. The three non-students
take the form of one staff advisor
to PUPC, one faculty member ap-
pointed by the chancellor from
nominations of the ‘PUPC executive
board, and one alumni appointed
by the ofﬁcetof student activities
from nominations by the executive
board. '

Keeping with the stipulations im-
posed by SGB, the board is an ex-
ample of the “makeup” of the
university, according to Giangarlo.

“In view of the fact that it was a
policy and budgetary making
board, we saw it as representative

of the entire university,” Giangarlo
said, responding to allegations
made by Martin Bertocchi concern-
ing the possibility that there is not
enough student representation on
the board. -

Bertocchi had presented his
disagreements with the proposed
constitution at Thursday’s SGB

/meeting which incidentally had not
been attended by any members of
PUPC, and then he repeated them
at the meeting of the PUPC ex-
ecutive council on Friday.

Bertocchi’s primary fears center
on too much control by the univer-
sity administration within the board
of governors, and he questioned the
management of PUPC being
“placed in the hands of people who
were not really-sure have the exper-

'tise” to make policy decisions for

PUPC. He asked if the activities of

PUPC would be student activities ‘

or become “activities of the Ofﬁce
of Student Activities.”

“It represents an unasked for ex-
tension’of PUPC. . .by the office of
student activities,” Bertocchi said
at Thursday’s SGB meeting, center-
ing his attack on the two advisors to

‘ PUPC who would have had voting

privileges within the Board of
Governors in the April 9 revision of
the proposed constitution that the
SGB had discussed at Thursday’s
meeting. V

“I‘saw office of Student ,Ac-
tivities written all over this pro-
posal,” Bertocchi said,“ “it was
more or less the advisor who hand-
ed these to them and said ‘what do
you think?’.”

But Joyce Giangarlo disagreed
with Bertocchi on her role as a
voting member of the board .of

governors. Concerned that at least _

one staff advisor should be on the
board for an “overview of what’s
hapnened at other univer-

sities,”. . .“for the level of exper-
tise that comes from experience,”
Giangarlo said. '

Giangarlo attacked Bertocchi for
a lack of familiarity of the opera-
tions of the proposed board of
governors. ,

“The board of governors decides
policy, the committee level decides
-programming. I see it as one of
those administrative decision mak-
ing roles. I don’t think he’s familiar
with our format, he has to come
down here,” she said.

The eventual outcome of Thurs-
day’s SGB decision on the April 9
revision of the proposed constitu-
tion’was a vote to reject it, and Ber-
toccchi proposed three changes
concerning the role of the advisor
position on the board: to delete the
position of staff advisors on the
board, to increase the number of
members on the boards elected
from and by the PUPC to three,
and to remove the advisors from the
selection committee for student

The new campus bus route,
which students have been re-
questing -for so long, will ﬁnally
come into existence starting May 5,
1980, according to Student Govern-
ment Board member, Bernadette
Herward. , ‘

Herward said that the spring term

- would be used to- work out opera-

tional differences in the bus route
and schedule so that when the ma-
jority of students return in the fall,
all difficulties will have_ been handl-
ed. ’

SGB administrations have been
working on a new campus route for
at least two years now, said Her-
ward, in an effort to meet student
demands for a’ campus bus servicing
South Oakland. ’

. In devising a new bus route for
the campus, Herward said that she
and SGB member Martin Bertocci
had difficulties in coming up with a
workable route in -South Oakland
due to objections by Port Authority

Transit, which said that it would in— ‘

terfere with a PAT bus, the 84E,
whic also goes into South

. Oakland.

Bertocci said he doubted whether

Expanded Campus Bus Route Goes into Oiperc1tio”nMay 

the campus bus in South Oakland
would_aff_ect PAT proﬁts on the

84E, as he felt that relatively few ‘S

students are patrons of the 84E. V
A compromise, however, was

worked out between SGB, along 4 I

with Jan Thomas of university
parking, and PAT. According to
Herward, the decision’ was to run
the campus’ bus in South Oakland
after 7:00 p.m., when the 84E stops
its run. -

Herward said that the comer of
Fifth Avenue and Bigelow Street

will be the new starting point for the ‘
- route. ' ‘

The day route will begin at 7:30
a.m. and end at 7:00 p.m., when the
night route begins, and will run un-
til 10:30 p.m.. Each run will take
approximately twenty-ﬁve minutes,

with twenty-one stops during the A

day route and twenty-five stop
during the night route. ' \’

There _will be extensive publicity”
to let students know of the new
route, Herward said. I_.lniver_sity ’
parking is providing huge mapsof .

the route to be posted at central

spots on campus. '
In addition, there will be ques-

tionaires placed on the campu_s bus

during spring term, to get feed-back ‘

on student opinions, she said.

I LAC Chairman Named

Under New Bylaws .

(Continued from Page 1)

DeLuca, however, disagreed and
said that he told the committee he
had not madde a decision as to

“whether he would run or not.

Mele said _Crissman has a per-
sonality people will not be in con-
ﬂict with, and another important
factor in choosing him was the fact
that he_is “new blood.” Bertocchi

' had made a similar comment at last

week’s SGB meeting.

“Dave Crissman was new blood
in the sense that he did not have any
ties with SGB or the Legal
Awareness Committee,” Curiale
said.

“Because I had the initiative to
getinvolved and be a very active

committee member, I wasn’t ap-
pointed chairman,” DeLuca said.
“If you want to be a chairperson of
a standing committee, don’t get in-
volved with the committee at all.”

Crissman said he believed the
adhoc committee chose him because,
it believed he could stabilize the
LAC.

“I think I can work with
people,” Crissman commented.

Bertocchi said Crissman was
chosen by a consensus of the adhoc
committee, He added that the
adhoc committee voted, the vote
would have been six to zero in favor
of Crissman. Mele, however, said
he was not sure the vote would have
been unanimous.

ens, ABC Fight for No. 1

By The Associated Press

NEW YORK — CBS and ABC,
battling down to the wire in the
closest ratings race in a decade, are
ﬁring an unprecedented arsenal of
multi-million-dollar programming
at the American television viewing
public starting Monday.

With prestige more than proﬁts
at stake, the two networks are
counting on a mixture of sensa-
tional new fare and reruns of earlier
ratings winners as the 1979-80
prime-time season enters its last
week.

The finish will not be clear-cut.
CBS and NBC say that the leaders
are neck-and-neck, both with
average Nielson ratings for the

se_as_on of 19.5. That means that

during an average evening hour,
19.5 percent of all U.S. households
with TV sets were tuned to each net-
work.

But ABC began its prime-time
season a week ahead of the opposi-
tion, and entered the last week of
the season claiming a lead over CBS
o_f'two-tenths of a point.

For the last night of the season,
April 20, ABC has scheduled a
repeat of the Oscar-winning movie,
“The Sting,” opposite a two-hour

“Dukes of Hazzard” special on,

CBS and NBC’s broadcast back-to-
back of previously aired episodes of
“CHiPs.”

On Monday night, ABC is
assured of a big audience for the
Academy Awards show.

eating raw eggs in one hour. Marsh
came up 12 short as he swallowed 39
raw eggs.

The record, set by ‘a Californian
two years ago, is 50 eggs in one hour.

. Last year, Marsh ate 46 eggs
before Mother Nature dealt a cruel
blow to his quest.

Marsh vowed to try again.

About 800 people crammed into
the parking lot of a local bar here to
see him try again Saturday.

The 22-year-old assistant manager
of a local gas station said he was
looking forward to his challenge.

He appeared visibly upset while

wondered out loud if some of the

Marsh decided to wait until 58

Marsh climbed onto a table and

“I don’t think that I’m going to

that the woman’s daughter

A SSGBV, PUPC Meet to Revise Program Council Constitution  

(Continued from Page 2)

coordinator. Aware of the impor-
tance of expediency in the passage
of the constitution, SGB member
Joe Blazer had suggested that a
meeting be set up between PUPC
and SGB to discuss the constitu-
tion.

At Friday’s meeting between
SGB and the PUPC executive
board, Bertocchi said “advisors are

» ~f'me but they should stay down the

hall in the advising office,” he said
and-added that there was a need for

more students from PUPC on the ‘

board.

“Programs should stay largely in

the hands‘ of students,” Bertocchi
said. . - -
However, Judy Katany, chairper-
son of the entertainment commit-
tee, refuted Bertocchi’s interpreta-
tion/of the purpose of the board of
governors.

“According to the constitution,”
Katany said, “we don't have to ask
them for permission for our pro-
grams. They seem to me as an
o/verseeing board due to the number
of programs.”

And Eric Johnson, chairperson
of PUPC’s newly formed technical

committee, defended the positin of ,

the advisor on the board, citing the
need for experience on the board.

“The people that are brought in
are because of their experience in
the field,” he said, referring to the
staff advisor.

“The only people that are going
to know what it’s like to be.the

\
chairman of the board are the
outgoing chairman and the
advisor.” he added.

“The big thing you’ve got to look
at in programming is experience. I
can see diluting the inﬂuence if you
want to increase the amount of
students, but you have to maintain
the advisor’s influence
somewhere,” Johnson said.

But Bertocchi remained adamant
in his position, saying that the ad-
visors position carries an
“overestimated weight,”
stimulating a response from Bill
Jackson, chairperson of the lecture
committee, who spoke of the need
for the advisor’s opinion “night
then and there.” ,.

Bill Abraham, who had recently
said it wasn't the purpose of SGB to
“dictate” what a group should do,
was also in attendence at Friday’s
meeting between SGB and PUPC,
largely siding with PUPC underthe
assumption that he sees no reason.
to intervene if the PUPC students
are going to have to live under the
constitution that they create.

“Itseems to be the balance of

A non-students that concerns

people,” Abraham said, referring
to the primary fears Bertocchi had
been voicing. “I think an underly-
ing assumption is that somehow, as
a student you are going to owe

something to that non-student. For .

people to say that you’re going to

be inﬂuenced is not giving students \

enough credit.”

When Bertocchi was confident
that he had explained his primary
concerns with PUPC’s constitution,
he asked the PUPC executive board
to make a decision on “what you
think,” and he and the remaining
members of SGB left Litchfield
Suite, along with Joyce Giangarlo,
so that the board might arrive to a
decision amongst themselves.

The outcome of the executive
board’s revisions of the April 9 pro-
posed constitution included:

—to increase the number of
members’ selected from and by the
PUPC executive board to two
students;

—to decrease the number of
voting staff advisors to PUPC on
the Board of Governors from two
to one; _

—the duty of the board to select
the business manager but not the

/student coordinator;

——striking the business manager ~

from a position on the executive
board;

—giving the «responsibility of
selecting a student coordinator to
the executive board; _

——requiring that applicants for
the position of student coordinator
be presently holdingthe office of a
committee chairperson and

—.stating that the business
manager be accountable to the ex-
ecutive board. , ,.

Andy Smith, director of student
activities, has remained chieﬂy an
observer during the writing of the
constitution.

/

“I’ll take a look at the document
when it’s presented,” he said.

“The document meets the points
necessary from my standpoint. It
should be a board with a majority
of students,” Smith added.

According to Smith, his position
with the board will be to “share
authority with the board of gover-
nors,” as delegated to him from the
vice chancellor of student affairs.

Smith also pointed out the fact
that the Board of Trustees has the
ultimate veto power, and that if
anything happens outside of
the Board of Trustees and acts
against that,” someone has to be
able to -say ‘fellows, you didn’t do
that right.’ ” 1

When asked to respond to allega-
tions centering on too much power
within the PUPC board of. gover-
nors, Smith responded by saying
“We have significantly increased
the student input in the decision ,
making process from what has hap-
pened in the past.”

’ One member within PUPC, Ron

‘&

Story, has voiced disapproval of the
proposed constitution, calling it a
“rush job” and criticizing it for a
lack of student input. .

Story likened the proposed con-
stitution to the Media and Publica-
tions proposed constitution, center-
ing on Andy Smith’s and Conney
Kimbo’s position in the proposal.

“Andy Smiths’ « the wat-
chdog. . .the ﬂow circle is like Con-
ney Kimbo then to Andy Smith,”
Story said.

But enthusiasm is running higﬁr

amongst the majority of. PUPC
members over their new constitu-
tion, the first ever for the organiz-
tion. L g

“I would say it’s a step for-
ward. . .it gets the whole package‘
for more activities,” Lorelei Kelley,
chairperson of PUPC’s arts com-
mittee said. /-

f And “Eric Johnson, chairperson ‘

of the technical committee was en-
thusiastic that the fear of being
under contract was gone, and that
“being autonomous in that way is a
step forward.”

Opinion

Monday, April 14, 1980—l’age 7" 

   Voyage

It happens every Spring. ' .
' The end of the term comes and Pitt students scat-
ter.

Some go home for the summer to families and
jobs, while others stay in Pittsburgh to study and
work. _

For some, those graduating seniors, April marks
both an ending and a beginning, as they reach that
final point in their college careers and prepare to em-
bark on a journey outside the protective walls of
academia. ‘ 4

They have all, regardless of whether they are
freshmen, sophomores, juniors or seniors endured
moments of frustration, dispair and disappointment
throughout their college careers, moments of
standing in long registration lines, impossible courses
with instructors that left a lot to be desired and of

course finding out that those straight A’s that came,

so easily in high school areefew and far between in
college.

Receiving an education at the University of Pitts-
burgh means losing a little of that wide-eyed idealism
about the prospects of life at a large urban university

a job market where the supply of bachelor degree ' "

holding graduates outnumber the demand.

Students also find that sometimesthe most _lHlp0I_'-(20. _
tant lessons are not learned in the classroom but in-_-- ’ "

stead by participating in student activities, working
outside the classroom and by. merely living and

associating with students from allsocial, economic, ‘P -

religious and ethnic backgrounds. Learningto live

with and accept, while not necessarily agreeing with , 

the beliefs of these diverse groups of students at Pitt
is in itself a learning experience. '

Students find that college is a convenient stop '

over, an incubation period where they are afforded
the opportunity to mature both intellectually and
socially. ‘ i ‘ '

Following this incubation period some of- these ,

students will go on to find that elusive “pot of gold”
finding professional success and prosperity. Others,
may I falter along the way, and encounter some

roadblocksthat may delay their trip down the road to A I

success. ‘
The decision of whether to‘ travel that road

uninterrupted is one entirely left to the student who _  

must possess the motivation and stamina needed to
succeed in any field. . I
’ We leave these thoughts and reflections of the

“college experience” with our readers and wishing

 iPii’r's Residence Halls:

 By CHRIS RASMUSSEN

There's something about living in
the Pitt dormitories that I really
love, but_I can’t seem to put afinger
on it. I have been thinking about

, why I return to Tower B year after

year but I can't seem to find a

0. reason. There must be something
‘ incredibly great about the dorms.

Yes indeed, there must be.

I know one thing: I enjoy a
challenge. And there are plenty of
challenges to face. I particularly en-
joy running hurriedly down the
stairs, late for class or something,
rounding a corner, and then clumsi-
ly plunging my feet in the stenchy,
sticky remnants of several uneaten

, ice cream cones. I love being caught

off-guard, “tricked,” so to speak.
-But the real delight is that I did the

. same thing the day before. Fool me A

once, shame on you. Fool me twice,
shame on me. The next time I'm
late for class, I’ll take my time. I’m
not stupid, just a little slow. I think
it gives me a real thrill to anticipate

A the unexpected.

But somehow, I don’t believe
that is the major reason I love the
dorms.

It might be the combination of

‘challenges I’ come up against.

There's always a broken ﬂuorescent
tube or two lying seductively on the
stairs, just waiting to embed a piece
of itself into my Adidas. The
crackling sound that’s produced is
really nifty. Nothing, except
perhaps stepping on cockroaches

which I also find the occasion to do,
makes a better noise. But do you
know those pieces of glass eventual-
ly end up on floors and in the rugs
of private rooms? That, I find, is
incomparably magnificent, well-
planned destruction. I think the ex-

.tra money that is paid to housing

every year for damages is well worth
it; cutting your foot on a piece of
glass is a great way of getting up in
the morning. It gets the blood cir-
culating, you know. '

Letter
Evaluation?

Last week our Current Problems
28 class,_ The University, was
monitored by Director of Special
Student Services A1 Bowen. The
class was monitored because it ad-
dresses controversial issues about
Pitt and suggests (as everyone

‘ﬁr

if.

already has confirmed) that Pitt is j '

not a Utopia. Issues and viewpoints
such as these must threaten the ad-
ministration, causing them to raise
their guard. Being,’ monitored

and I would have had to ‘limp to
class (pun intended), but th_at’s
okay: I would have loved making a
fool out of myself. I doubt if my
girl friend would have found it as
humorous though, but that’s also
okay—sometimes she just doesn’t
understand me.

Besides the challenges, however,
there is the artwork. Nothing suits
my tastes better than a little pencil-
and-pen interior decoration. It’s a

  What to

By CINDY COHEN
‘Pitt News Staff Writer .
There is something about the
printed word. It looks neat, per-
suasive and. . .credible. Comparing

‘printed words with written words is

like comparing Walter Cronkite -to
Ted Baxter, who are you going to
believe?

Even though most of us are tired
of hearing about how apathetic we
are when compared to the students

‘of the 60’s maybe there is some

truth in the observation. Maybe we
should question things a little bit
more.

We are barraged by the printed
word." But unlike any other era in
history, we are expected to digest
and evaluate this information in
order to make decisions which will
affect our lives. . .

Sure, you~don’t have to read the
New York Times every day in order
to be informed but there comes a
point in time when you have to turn
to some information source other

than the kid who lives down the hall

or the Pitt News.

obscene pictures, and expletives to
shock the naive. I know I like to be
shocked; I can’t imagine how many
hundreds of others also get a kick
out of it. Hell, if it weren’t for these
great works of art, I would never
have discovered the word
“smegma.” Somehow, I just can’t
picture‘ myself as a complete,
mature individual unknowing of its
definition.'Ah, college life is so
educational.

I also love music, all types, but
particularly acid ‘rock and disco,
and the later in the day‘ the better. I
love to perform experiments with
the Richter instrument I have in my
room. It’s well worth getting out of

bed at three o’clock in the morning
to watch the breaking of a previous-
ly untouched record.

The weekends in the dormitories
are fantastic. There are parties
everywhere, people having a great
time, socializing and drinking
responsibly. It must be those late-
night snack excursions to
McDonald's and the Original which
makes everyone throw up in the
bathroom. On a good weekend,
you can find quite an obstacle
course. The food must make
everyone sick to their stomachs, I
guess".

One of the old tricks, I unders-
tand, is still very effective at in-

conveniencing hundreds of your
best friends—the ultimate practical
joke. It is the fire alarm gag. Just
another bit of funto spice up your
life, I suppose. What a clever way
to get to see lots of young ladies in
their bathrobes. I think it’s rather
sad that no one appreciates. the
joke. It was, I’m sure, all in fun.
Some people just don’t have a sense
of humor. ,

All in all, I honestly love it here.

My friends are wonderful people. ,

We go to the movies across the
street, we eat together, we stay up
late talking and laughing, and we
generally have an all-around great
time. But the funny thing is, they

 University Residence Halls Provide Survival Education   

that goes on here. They think it is  
ridiculous, immature and crass, 

They want to move out, get an
apartment. They can if they want

to, but I'm not going. Just becauseg ;

they think everyone else is

disrespectful, they want to move V"
out. It-seems pretty silly to me; if L
they would only stay and try to im-"‘
prove things for themselves and the ’ ,.
others who agree with them, they :1» 

might surprise themselves. The

changes wouldn’t bother me that" 
much.

\»

There's something about why my

friends are moving out that I really , V  

hate. Only now, I think I’m beginn-
ing to understand... ‘

Read? There Are Choices to be Made...  in

What we: should learn to do is

“assess whatwe read very carefully

before we form or change our opin-
ions on anything. Look at what
your reading and what you are
reading it for. I
When you’re sitting on Pitts-
burgh’s version of Daytona Beach
(the Cathedral Lawn—the in crowd
sits on the Fifth Avenue side) and

need a little break Rona Barrett’s
Hollywood Gossip is ﬁne (you can
also use it to cover your eyes-and
take a nap or transport fresh fish
from the market). When you want

to know about a candidate for the '

presidency you can stick with Rona
and find out who Eric Estrada likes
or you can ﬁnd a paper or a
magazie which will tell you what the

candidate said.

Papers and magazines are far
fromperfect and each has its own
distinct style and personality. You
can easily find the one that is right
for you, but before you latch on to
its politics check out its credibility.

There are two ways you can read,
find something that will tell you
what you want to hear and rein-

force your own opinions or find I

something that will ,separate the

news and its analysis and make your’ »

own decision. , _
I'm tired of being called part of
the “me” generation, unless what

that really means is that I can make "
my own choices and decide things-

for myself, intelligently and with an
open mind. '

Nixon used to
have the
Washington Post
delivered to the

White House every-

morning...but only

the sports section.

What we should begin to realize
is, whatever the quality of this in-
formation, people out there are bas-
ing their decisions and their opi-
nions on what they read. What do
legislaters read, and does it affect
their opinions? What does Jimmy
Carter curl up with at night before
he watches the Carson show. (pro-.
viding _ Richard Dawson isn’t the
guest host)? * ’

Former President Nixon used to
have the Washington Post delivered

to White House every morn-
. ing. . .but only the sports section.

The fact remains that there are
thousands of people out there
writing in thousands of papers,
periodicals and journals in the
hopes of informing and persuading
you. During the Supreme Court’s
dialogue on the Bakke case, law
journals were filled with articles
representing most of the points of

_ view. This isn’t to say that there

was anything wrong with that, but

let us hope that the justices could ~

differentiate between fact and opin-
ion.

President Ford pledged support of Operation Babylift, “the air-
lifting of South Vietnamese orphans to the safety of the

collection agency. . .“Where a lot of people won’t give their blood,

they will sell their plasma,” said spokesman for the agen-

TEN YEARS AGO

Students were “escaping ﬁnals” by going to a Cartoon Fesitival
featuring such favorites as “Daffy Duck, Roadrunner, and Abbott
and Costello”. . .SMAP (Sunshine, Music, America, Peace) was a
local organization bringing rock groups “from across the nation” to
East Liberty. . .The Cathedral Tuck Shop (now Burger Chef in the
Cathedral) was “looking for a new way to create ptomaine” accor-
ding to students who frequented the place. . . In a column about new
fad lifestyles: “We have this fake need to be hip, or jock or prim
lady or intellectual or super-liberal or anything. Let us be us—unlike
a roll of tied up toilet paper your fingers cannot grab and loosen.”

TWENTY YEARS AGO

A male student wrote a cutesy feature on the use of laundry facilities
at the University. . .He complained that laundry services “wrote the

instructions for housewives”. . .for example “separate your clothes

as you ususally do’.’. . .A space ﬁller read:' Money talks and these
days it’s always in a hurry to say good-bye. . .TWA Airlines was
looking for airline hostesses. . .qualifications included: minimum
age 20, height: 5’2”—5’8”, 100 to 135 pounds, 20/ l00 vision or bet-
ter, natural hair color, clear complexion, attractive and unmar-
ried. . .

_ THIRTY YEARS AGO

Mathematicians figured out that the average parade band member
marches 160 miles in formation‘ during football season. . .Cliff
Chambers, Pirate baseball pitcher in the 1950s was enrolling at -the
University for “the 'sole- purpose _ of furthering his
education”. . .Pitt’s baseball coach was forced to take a “hands-off
attitude” for the 28-year old star was a professional . . . Pitt News was

Senior Year Reflections:



Did They Get Their Money's Worth?

By RICH COOK

It had been a long, hot day for the
freshman and he longed for the air-
conditioning of his Tower’s room.
He had waited to get his meal-ticket
picture taken,’ waited to pay his bill,
and now found himself waiting for
an elevator to take him to the eighth
floor. Ten minutes later, he arrived
in front of his new home. Stuffing a
sweaty hand into the cramped pocket
of his blue-jeans, he extracted the
key and opened the door. The cool
blast of air he had expected was in-
stead the stale odor of cigarettes. His
roommate lounged on the half-made
bed, reading the latest copy of Pent-
housewhile sipping on a beer. The
freshman eased into the room, drop-
ping his ninety _dollars worth of
books on the floor.

His roommate tossed‘ the
magazine aside and"'swung his legs
into the dust-covered floor.

“Hi, my name is Wayne; I moved

' in while you were gone. . .what -do

ya think of the way I decorated the
place?” __ -

The freshman stared at the black
rug hanging from the ceiling; the
embroidered form of a naked woman
staring at his roommate’s pillow. _

_ “It’s different,” the freshman
murmered.

“Well, I left you plenty of room
for your stuff,” Wayne replied

cheerfully as he returned to his bed

and the magazine.

“I thought_these places were‘air-
conditioned,” the freshman ques-
tioned, wiping the sweat from his
forehead.

“Yeah, but I think they turned it

off cause of the energy crisis, neat’

huh?”

“Well, what about the windows?”

“lt’s supposedly against the rules
to open the windows.”

“But. . .”

“Don’t worry, I know someone
who is getting the key, he'll be
around sometime this afternoon.”

“But what if the RA finds out?”

“He’s the one with the key.”

“Oh. . .”

The freshman’s first few _weeks
went easily; college life wasn’t as
hard as he thought it might be. The
course material wasn’t mu_ch harder
than the things he had learned in
high school and everything was go-
ing fine; until his first chemistry
exam. After a seemingly useless
night of studying, he trudged down
the hill following the test. He waited
the usual ten minutes for an elevator
before finally reaching his room.
Clearing the smoke with one hand,
he greeltu his roommate who was
also studying; Hustler.

. “Didn’t the coach say something
about smoking those things all the

» time?”

His roommate flipped a page and

shrugged. _

“So how’d you do on the test?”

_ The freshman pursed his lips

formming the sound similar to that

of a bomb, just before it hits its
target.

“That was a chem eleven test.

wasn’t it?” .

“Yeah, so?”

“So, the way you studied last
night, you probably pulled a C,
everyone thinks they flunk those
things.”

twenty-five answers, you call that a

“Just wait and see. . .”

A week later, the freshman waltz-
ed into his room, the chemistry test
results stuffed into his back pocket.

“You are not going to believe this,

‘ but I got a thirty-nine percent on that

chem test. . .and that was a C.”
His roommate peered out from his

Playboy and grinned. -cg,
“What did I tell you, these courses‘

anything, they just want to weed out
their pre-meds. When I had that
course, I gota forty-three percent on
the final and passed. I had a TA
who couldn’t speak English and a
prof who was about‘ as available as
Bo Derek.” ‘

“But I don’t want to go to med
school,_ I just took this for my
distributionof studies. It doesn’t
make sense, all this crap for
nothing.”

His roommate grinned while pull-
ing out the center-fold, “Welcome to
Pitt.”

The senior didn't mind the ten
minute walk from campus to his new
apartment. The walk was better
than waiting for the elevator and he
wasn’t force-fed that terrible food.

By now, the weather was finally
getting warmer, finals and gradua-
tion were only a few weeks away.
He trudged up the ﬁnal set of steps to
his apartment, his three-piece suit in
various degrees of dishelvement; .
another day of interviews finished.
He opened the door, glanced at the

  Jimmy Carter Gains Limited support For Moscow Boycott P

by the Associated Press

President Carter’s call for allied
unity on policy toward Iran’ and
Afghanistan gained limited support
Sunday. Japan and some European
nations recalled their ambassadors
from Tehran for consultations and
others edged closer to joining
America’s boycott of the Moscow

in - Olympics.

. France and West Germany, in an
apparent effort to maintain

' negotiating ﬂexibility, said the recall

0.f, European ambassadors did not

‘signal a step toward severing full ’

diplomatic relations with
Tehran-L-nor a_ final European deci-

  

 

sion to join the United States in im-
posing economic sanctions against
Iran. President Carter announced
both steps last Monday as a result of
the continuing hostage crisis in Iran,
and urged allies to join the U.S.
move.

French Foreign Ministry officials
announced the foreign ministers of
the nine European Community. na-
tions will meet in Luxembourg April
21 to assess their attempts to secure
release of the American hostages who
spent their 162nd day of captivity
Sunday at the U.S. Embassy in
Tehran. ‘T - .

Denmark’s ambassador’-also was
recalled from Tehran; an Italian
newspaper reported Italy’s am-
bassador was returning to Rome;
Spain recalled its ambassador, a
Bonn government official said the
chief envoys from the other Common
Market nations—Britain, Luxem-

‘ bourg, Ireland, Belgium and‘ the

Netherlands—would also return to
their capitals for consultations. The
ambassadors met with Iran’s Presi-
dent Abelhassan Bani-Sadr on
Saturday.

In. response to President Carter’s
call for uniﬁed allied support, in-
cluding a reported deadline for

_ agreement,

the ambassadors
demanded immediaterelease of the
American hostages.

Bani-Sadr rejected the demand
and warned that Iran would cut off
oil exports to any country joining the
U.S.-backed sanctions.

Satu-rday’s decisions by the U.S. 1

Olympic "Committee not to send
American athletes to the Moscow
Summer Games because of the
Soviet intervention in Afghanistan»

appeared -certain to put increased -

pressure on U.S. allies to join the

‘ boycott. .

The president of J apan’s Olympic

o Committee said the U.S. decision

will “gravely affect” Japan’s own
decision. The president of the
Norwegian Sports Federation said
the U.S. group’s actoni would make

it “easier” for Norway to join the '

boycott.

West German Chancellor Helmut
Schmidt reiterated over the weekend
that a continuing Soviet presence in
Afghanistan would virtually rule out
West German participation in the
games. ‘

Maurice Gerzeg, a member of
France’s Olympic Committee, said if
West Germany endorsed the
boycott, “the position of France

‘would be very delicate.”

Jim Rooker Is

First Pirate 

To Hitﬂomer

ST. LOUIS-—Jim Rooker gave
up five hits in 6 1/3 innings and hit
hisseventh career home run, leading
the Pittsburgh Pirates to their third
straight victory, a 3-0 decision over
the St. Louis Cardinals Sunday.

Rooker’s homer, a line shot over
the left—field fence with Phil Garner

on base, came in the seventh innings;

In the St. Louis seventh, Ken Reitz
singled and Ken Oberkfell doubled,
driving Rooker from the game. Enri-
que Romo came in and stymied the
St. Louis threat.

Grant Jackson provided lastout
relief of Romo in the ninth to pick up
the save. ‘

A throwing error by Cardinal
shortstop Garry Templeton unlocked
a scoreless tie in the fifth. Ed Ott

. stroked a leadoff double off loser

Silvio Martinez and scored when
Templeton scooped up Omar
Moreno’s grounder and threw wildly
past first base.

In the seventh, Ott singled but was
picked off first base before Garner
walked and Rooker homered.

Through six innings the only St.
Louis hit off Rooker was
Templeton’s double ‘and singles by
George Hendrick and Keith Her-
nandez.

Rooker struck out six and walked
four. His homer, his first since June
13, 1976, was his second in a Na-
tional League uniform.

First Annual Pitt Relays Turn Out To Be Quite Successful

- The first annual Pitt Relays
wasn’t actually a relay meet at all,
but despite cold, windy weather at
Pitt Stadium yesterday afternoon, it
turned out to be a success.’

While the Pantherettes’ indoor
invitational attracts such prestigious
schools as Maryland, Michigan
State and Morgan State, yesterday’s
meet was geared toward smaller
school participation. To be sure,
Temple and West Virginia were
there, but so were California State,
Slippery Rock State College,
Frostbrug and Indiana University
of Pennsylvania.

“The competition was very

good,” said Pitt coach Alfreeda

Goff. “A meet like this is good

before regionals (to be hosted by
Pitt next month). All the athletes
and officials made the meet a suc-
cess.”

Many of the larger Eastern
Association of Intercollegiate
Athletics for Women (EAIAW)
schools are from as far away as
Maine and upstate New York and
two trips to Western Pennsylvania
in one month would be financially
unreasonable.

For the Pantherettes, freshman
Kathe Dvorsak showed the home
crowd with a first-place effort in the
pentathelon. Dvorsak’s point total

of 2837 forthe shot .put, hurdles,.

high jump, ‘long jump and
800-meter run was high enough to
qualify for Eastems. It was also

only the second time she had com-
peted in the five-event competition.

Other top ﬁnishers for Pitt were
Kim Green, second in the 200-meter
dash and fourth in long jump;
Marie Huff, third in javelin and
sixth in shot put; Terri McKee,

Winners from other schools in-
cluded Temple’s Edna Brown (400

and 3000 meters) WVU’s Karen
Mallery (100- and 200-meter

Melvin (5000 meters) and the Tem-
. ple mile-relay team.

While the women were finishing
up the weekend at home, the Pan-
ther tracksters had returned from a
trip to the University of Tennessee’s
‘Dogwood Relays.

Top finisher for Pitt- was Gary
Siriano, who placed sixth in the
championship divisipn of the 5000
meter run (14:22.9). An almost in-
credible 75 runners competed in this

‘ one race. The first nine seeded run-

ners were given starting places at
the front of the crowd, then the
next nine were put in lanes behind.
After that, it was every man for
himself at the start. Fortunately for
Siriano, his eighth-place seeding
assured him room in the front.

The.Pitt two-mile relay of Joel
Albers, Darren Geary, Greg Con-
over and Terry Gallagher were
eighth-place finishers with a time of
7:43. The day before that relay, the
four runners competed in the open
800-meters. Geary and Albers
fared the best here, with times of
l:50.2 and 1252.7, respectively.

A mile relay of Dwayne Defoor,
Al Coles, Bud Cooper and Larry
Shippen did not place, but
nonetheless turned in its best time
of the year with a 3:14.9 clocking.

The Panthers are off track this
weekend, but the ladies will com-
pete in the University of Maryland
Invitational on Sunday. The
following week, both teams will-
send‘ representatives to the
prestigious Penn Relays ' in
Philadelphia. '

  The Year In Sports-A Look Back At The way It Was

While all the Pitt Panthers and Pantherettes prepare for
finals, memories of yet another academic year full of ups
and downs in the world of sports come to mind. So that
these unforgetable moments are not forgotten, here’s a
short ‘recap.

In September, the Pitt football team started its season

back Rick Trocano and freshman Dan Marino were battl-
ing it out for the number one position. Pitt started out the
season with a 24-7.drubbing of Kansas, but floundered in a
17-7 second game loss to North Carolina.

The Panthers then began a rampage, in rattling off 10
straight wins, including a 26-14 upset of Washington at
Seattle and a 24-17 victory over West Virginia in the last
game to ever be played at Mountaineer field. The Hoopies
just couldn’t manage to win one for the field.

In the Navy game, Trocano was taken out in the first
quarter with a pulled hamstring. Marino came in and star-
red, completing 22 of 30 for 227 yards, two touchdowns
and no interceptions.

Pitt ﬁnally defeated Penn State after a two year lull and a
20 year gap at Beaver Stadium. Despite being picked to
lose by two, the Panthers embarrassed the Lions on na-
tional television 29-14 and prepared to meet Arizona in the
Fiesta Bowl. Pitt won the Christmas day contest, 16-10.

Also in the football world, everyone remembers (right?)
the Pitt-Cincinnati game because of its early starting time.
The 10 a.m. contest was moved up to allow Pitt students to
attend, or at least watch the fourth game of the World

with high hopes and a whole lot of talent. Junior quarter- "

Out of Bouds

Series. »
The Fam-a-lee, or as they. used to be called, the Pirates of
Pittsburgh did a remake of “The Comback Kids” and
defeated the Baltimore Orioles four games to three. Pitt
students were thus granted another reason to dance and
celebrate in the streets of Oakland. »

The Panthertette volleyball team took a trip to California
and Hawaii to gain experience and compete against top
notch schools. Surprising to many folks, they came back
without tans, but with a lot of experience and media ex-
posure (something the Pantherettes weren’t used to) which
helped them in their eventual 13th place finish at nationals.

In October, Pitt’s number one fan, Tiger Paul announc-
ed he was leaving for sun and fun in Las Vegas to work for
casino. Luckily for those fans who really got psyched by
watching the Tiger, he hung around and did much for the

enthusiasm at Pitt basketball games.

The Steelers gave Pitt seniors that one last opportunity to
ﬂood the streets of Oakland and celebrate a victory with
their 31-19 win over Los Angeles in the Super Bowl.

As winter time rolled around, thoughts of the Lake
Placid Winter Olympics‘ were rampant in a typical
American’s mind. No one could ever forget Eric Heiden’s
golden performance of ﬁve medals and the U-S-A, U-S-A’s
surprising triumph in ice hockey. And who could forget
poor Tai and Randy who had to withdraw from figure
skating’s pairs competition and bring announcer Dick But
ton close to tears on national television. ’

Pitt’s basketball team downed a few good teams in its
own right. The Panthers beat Iona 75-63 and played tough
against Duke in a 78-69 loss before an overﬂow crowd at
the Field House. Against Duquesne, Pitt won, then lost,
then lost again. The last game was also the first round of
the Naitonal Invitational Tournament.

The big news of the hoops season, however, did not
come’ on the courts. Sam Clancy announced he would be
going out for football, andthen changed his mind, and
coach Tim Grgurich resigned, reapplied, and was turned
down.

Pitt instead hired Roy Chipman of Lafayette who has a
big job ahead of him. Incidentally, Chipman signed his
first recruit Saturday in Steve Beatty, a 6-8, 205-pound for-
ward from Slippery Rock High School.

That’s it. This year in sports as seen by the average Pitt

student: memorable memories to remember.

‘is’

By The Associated Press

13 “He "didn’t groove it,” said
Pittsburgh’s Jim Rooker after slam-
ming the seventh home run of his
major league career yesterday. “It
was actually out of the strike zone.
If it had been a good pitch, I pro-
bably wouldn’t have hit it.”

Both Rooker’s "blast off Silvio
Martinez and his pitching arm were
instrumental in the Pirates’ 3-0
triumph over the St. Louis Car-
dinals.

“As soon as I hit it, I knew it was
gone,” said the veteran left-hander.
“I was shocked. I kept saying, ‘I

_.{F'1on’t believe it. I don’t believe it.”’

Pittsburgh Manager Chuck Tan-
ner said Rooker was given a signal
to fake a sacriﬁce bunt and then hit
away against- a drawn-in St. Louis
infield.

“It was the furthest thing from
my mind. I was just hoping I could

make contact,” Rooker said. “The ‘

win is what’s important.”

Rooker, in addition to con-
tributing his key blast, silenced the
Cards on three hits through the first
six innings.

“This is the best start we’ve got-
ten off to since I’ve been here,”
said a happy Tanner following his
team’s third straight victory.

By The Associated Press '
NEW YORK—Pete Falcone and
Neil Allen combined on a ﬁve-hitter
and Joel Youngblood drove in two

runs to help the New York Mets
beat the Chicago Cubs 5-0 yester-
day.‘ ,
Falcone, 1-0, left the game with a
two-hitter after suffering a slight
pull in his left hamstring running

the bases in the sixth inning. Allen.

pitched the final three innings and
earned the save. Hehas saved both
New York victories this season.

The Mets scored an unearned run
off Cub starter Willie Hernandez,
0-1, in the second. John Stearns led
off with a double, took third on
Jerry Morales’ single and scored on
a passed ball by catcher Barry
Foote.

Youngblood collected his first
RBI in the third when he singled
home Frank Taveras,. who had
doubled. Youngblood opened the
fifth with a double and scored the
third New York run when Morales

doubled with one out to finish Her-
nandez.

New York scored twice ' in the
sixth off reliever Lynn McGlothen.
Falcone led off _with a single, moved
to second on a single by Steve
Henderson, took third on Taveras’
single and scored on Youngblood’s
sacriﬁce fly.

Stearns singled home Henderson
with the second run of the inning to
complete the scoring.

Reader Expresses Outrage

George Shaner’s feature, “Pittsburgh’s
New Wavers Throw a Bash at Lion Walk,”
[Showcase, 25 March 80] is obviously the
work of a dilettante hack with the precise
and lucid perceptions of the average
catatonic. In the interest of good (or even
vaguely accurate) journalism, I feel com-
pelled to point out a few of the mistakes
and misapprehensions contained in
Shaner’s in-depth report:

1) Shaner misquoted Joe Soap, presen-
ting a normally articulate individual as
some sort of drooling teenybopper. Soap
never says things like “real helpful,” nor is
he in the habit of repeating himself by
paraphrasing his previous sentence.

2) The idea behind the benefit was not
“to take the $3 donations collected at the
door and pour it (sic) back into a future
event.” All funds, minus P.A. and adver-

tising expenses,’were donated to Lion Walk .

Arts Center. That’s what made the event a
benefit. - p
3) There is no Barry Scum in the Bible.

. The singer/guitaristis Barney Scum of th

defunct (and legendary) Puke. . r
4) Sex Communicators, not Sex Com-
munique. -I know it’s a silly name, but at

‘least get it right.

5) The Cardboards do not feature “sax

and synthesizer over guitar.” There is no.

guitar in the Cardboards. As a matter of
fact, one of their songs is called “The
Guitar Annoys,” in which the guitar is
deemed an offensive and unnecessary ele-

A ment in modern music.

6) If Shaner thinks that “The Dark came
close to heavy metal. . .,” then he probably
can’t tell the difference between butter and,
margarine, either. Shaner seems to have
cited their version of “Working Class
Hero” only because he doesn't know the
names of any of their songs. Ask’ him.

7) The Compulsives are not “a develop-
ment of the Shut-lns,” any more than they
are a development of the Apes’ of God (also
an early Pittsburgh band) because I once
sang with them. To my knowledge, the last
time John Angola was in Los Angeles was
when he was three years old. Whether or
not that makes him an “L.A. refugee” is, I

suppose, a matter of individual interpreta-

tion. The compulsives are no more
“reminiscent of...the New York Dolls”
than the Dolls were reminiscent of the Vien-
na Boy’s Choir. Laurence’s instrument is

-anaggregation of devices, not a synthesizer.

He plays as~any band member does, and is
not involved in “treatments. . .of the rest
of the band’s sounds.”

.8) The Compulsives did not “unfairly
(jump) in front of the Whereabouts.” At
least 50 schedule changes occurred in the
weeks leading up to, and on the night of,
the twelfth. The juggling of the schedule
was meant to accommodate all of the
bands. It was assumed that the
Whereabouts wouldn’t mind being pushed
back one slot since, initially, they said that
they couldn’t play early due to far more im-
portant commitments like jobs, school and
homework. ,

The “negative crowd reaction” to the
Compulsives came from a large segment of
the audience comprised of the Whereabouts
and Cheetah Chrome’s entourage, who had
attempted (and failed) to take the stage as

perspective, more than a few of the bands
that played on the twelfth have been
together for one to three months. “Also
noteworthy is that (the Whereabouts)
played all original material.” Most of the
bands that played on the twelfth play
original material, with a cover or two
thrown in. But then again, Shaner pro-_
bably can’t differentiate between covers
and originals, when either are beyond the
scope of his limited view of music. Perhaps

more noteworthy is the fact that two of the

Whereabouts write for Showcase.

10) It’s the Guy Pumone Trio, not the
Guy Pnumone Trio.

11)Carsickness did not organize the
benefit. Joe Soap, a member of thatband,
did. Carsickness’ synthesizer player’s name

' is Steve Sync, not Dave, and he was not “in

the hospital.” “British guitarist Soap” is
not at all British_. He’s Irish. But then, I

guess they all look alike. Bobby Porter of7

Young Lust did join Carsickness on stage
for a tune orgtwo. John Creighton of No
Shelter, however, didnot. He did his bit

_ with Young Lust.

12) I am personally offended by the at-
titude inherent in the statement, “Surpris-
ingly, there was very little violence at the
event. . .” Our parties and gigs are notably
free of violence, except when the occasional
cretinous redneck who can’t get laid attacks
one of us. Phase III (before it becarnea
strip joint) was the only bar (with or

without music) that I've ever frequented ,
where I did not witness one fight.~Whenever

a slug brain like Shaner writes about
violence in connection with new music, he
helps to create an atmosphere in which it’s
fashionable to attack people for no reason,
which not only interferes withthe-music,"

but hurts, and necessitates reciprocal

violence, and then things get all messy. Our
main concern is music, not fighting. If we
wanted to ﬁght, we’d join the army.

By the way, Shaner, speaking of rampant
punk violence, a 16-year-old male was kill-
ed (stabbed to death, I belie_ve) at one of the
first gigs done by a punk.band called the
Beatles.

I’m well aware that bad press is better
than no press, but" please, next time, send
someone who knows what he’s talking
about and is able to absorb information
more ‘effectively than this wingnut Shaner. I
really don’t enjoy writing angry letters. I’m

a nice guy. ’ _

Changes In

By CHRIS RASMUSSEN -

. The Pitt Union Program Council
is changing. Four new committees
have been added, a proposed consti-
tution has been drawn up, and even
the name may have been changed: it
could be known in the _future as the
Pitt Program Council.

at Joyce Giangarlo, assistant direc-

tor of student activities and chief
advisor to the council, emphasizes
that the restructuring will be for the
better-—of all Pitt students. Besides
the appending of four new facets of
programming (homecoming, video,
technical support and concerts),
Giangarlopoints out that the coun-
cil has broadened the scope of its
capabilities andhas made it possible
for the increased input in regard to
policymaking.

Because of the student activity fee
increase next year, the Student
Government Board felt that it was
necessary to shift the responsibility
of homecoming programming to the
council. -

“I found this to be entirely ‘
reasonable,” Giangarlo said in a re-
cent interview. Joyce Belich is the
chairperson of this, the largest of all
nine committees.

Through the acquisition of a
videotape recorder, projector and
seven—foot screen, the video‘ com-
mittee, chaired by Ed Kelley, was
founded. Among the events the
future holds are sporting events
broadcast onto the giant screen, and
the acquisition of a separate channel
for the dormitories’ televisions, so
reruns of lectures and other events,
including movie classics, can be
aired.

  

Assistant Director of Student Activities Joyce Giangarlo

‘. . .a new realm of programming. ’

“The technical support commit-
tee,” the assistant director stated,
“was formed because it was needed.
Before, all of the people who helped
us with the technical aspects. of pro- ,
gramming were in limbo between
other committees.”

“The addition of the concert
committee,” Giangarlo said, “is ob-
vious.”

Greg Charny, a sophomore in in-
dustrial engineering, is in charge of
the concert committee, which is
composed of approximately 20
students. Already the committee has
been busy collecting information

. from students with regard to what

' Bigler Photo

types of concerts they wold like to
see at Pitt next year. The results of
the poll will help guide the decisions
which will be made in late July, the
time of year when the schedules for
tours for the fall begin to be finaliz-
ed. -

— “Working with a budget of .
$72,000,” Charney said, “allows us
to plan about six concerts in the ‘
$12,000 to $15,000 range.” He also
added that the most probably loca-
tion for the performances will be
the 4,000-seat Syria Mosque, and
that reserve seating will be used.

The chairpeople of the five other

PUPC AimTo Improve Entertainment      r

committees are Judy Katany, enter-
tainment; Bill Hicks, recreation;
Lorelei Kelley, arts; Bill Jackson,
lecture; and Bob Baird, ﬁlm. All
groups are presently involved in
choosing the various acts and ap-
pearances for next fall, and they are
working hard.

“The major factor i.n deciding to
go with a certain program is its
desirability to the students,”
Giangarlo clariﬁed, “but we can
also select someone because he is ar-
tistically creative, notubased on an-

- dience alone.”

A constitution has been drawn up _
by members of the Pitt Union Pro-
gram Council, Giangarlo, and Bill,
Abraham, Student Government
Board president. It has been for-
warded to the SGB, Andy Smith,
director of student activities, and ’
Vice Chancellor, Conney Kimbo for
approval. Calling for the formula-
tion of a board of governors for the-
council, the constitution was design-
ed to delineate, in a concrete form,
the structure and method of func-
tion for the programming decisions.
The board will be. in charge of .
budgetary concerns, amendments to
the constitution, and general policy
for the program council.

Why the dropping of the word
“union” from the Pitt Union Pro-
gram Council? “Because,”
Giangarlo said, “we are taking
some of our activities to places off-
campus. It should open up a whole
new realm of programming.”

Yes, the Pitt Union Program

' Council has changed.

  Spring Flower Show Sprouts A Colorful Variety. ,

The Spring Flower Show
. Phipps Conservatory

March 16 - April 13

Bird nest ferns, golden barrel cacti, Fiji
fan palms, ' tulips, hydrangeas, golden
shrimp, glory bowers, jade plants, and
tulips all bloom beautifully beneath two-
and-a-half acres of glass at the Phipps Con-
servatory.

The Conservatory enticed Pittsburghers
in search of spring to bask in the naturally
beautiful displays at the _annual Spring

Flower Show, which ran through April 13..

Crocuses sprouted in full color on the front
lawn of the conservatory as the show ran,
timely reflections of the colorful displays
inside.

Fifty thousand people visited Phipps

‘Filmmaker Tony Buba’s Po

By JIM DUFFY

Name the cinema technique here:

The camera rolls, but no one call-
ed ‘‘lights’’ or “camera.” Sudden-
ly, there’s only the action. No prior
rehearsal. Still rolling.

Cinema Verite?

Right. _“Truth film,” in other
words.

For Tony Buba, an independent
filmmaker from Braddock, Pennsyl-
vania, a more character-oriented
style is added to verite, and his own
portrait-type documentary emerges.
His cinema depicts a biographical
form of his film characters.

The characters in Tony’s films are
mostly from Braddock, and their in-
timate portrayal on camera exudes a
refreshing honesty about their lives.
In Field of Vision, Richard
Leacock, a documentary filmmaker,

says that “. . .the cameraman’s
presence does alter what is in front
of him, but that the filmed people
g revert to their most everyday, com-
fortable actions, that the camera

from all over the world fill the high-
ceilinged entryway: the Silver Seamberry

’ from the West Indies, Chinese fan palm

from China, Spine palm from Puerto Rico,
and vivid red and pink cyclamen flowers
from Greece. ‘Eleven other display rooms
radiate. from the circular entryway on a net-
work of paths nearly a half-mile long.

The 11 displays presented individual
gardens. of varying sizes and designs-—
their common thread being the lush beauty
of healthy, blooming trees, shrubs, and
ﬂowers. Each garden represented.compat-
ible plant types in a cohesive, structural set-
ting. The variety and beauty of the gardens
revealed the variety and beauty of the entire
earth.

— Exotic ferns and Oriental and Greek

gardens contrasted with the parched greens

and grays of cacti and bright simplicity of
tulips and amarvllis. Fountains, statues,

becomes a truth enforcer.”

Tony’s camera records the sincer-
ity, jive talk, and the random
philosophy of his subjects in a
cross-section of his hometown;
we’re permitted a keyhole view of
unrehearsed human drama that
turns with pathos and hilarity.
Tony, whose films will be screened
April 18 at Benedum-Trees auditor-
ium has an M.F.A. from the
University of Ohio, and started into
filmmaking during graduate school.
Since, _he’s unearthed a wealth of
ideas from his Braddock
neighborhood. .

Betty’s Comer Cafe, a 13-minute
length film shot in a local Braddock
bar, opens upon an affable group
of steelworkers having a relaxing
time shooting pool and downing oc-
casional boilermakers at the bar.
They crack jokes and chat
nostalgically.’ But there’s a sense of ,-
spiritual dampness felt.

Tony’s camera pans across a row
of bottom-shelf liquors and to an ‘
ancient cash register, upon which

thatched roofs, elaborate brick walkways
and a water" wheel distinguished the excur-
sion into nature’s liveliest colors and
aromas from a simple walk in the woods.
The work put into providing an organized,

well-balanced show was evident in the posi- .

tion of each tulip, each tree.

Horticulturist Ed Vasilcik designed,
prepared and coordinated the show. He
has been with the Conservatory since 1971,
and worked with a staff of 30 to present the
Spring Flower Show. They worked for
three weeks to physically set up the show,
although some bulbs were ordered a year in
advance and most plants had -been nurtured
year around._ Vasilcik was the man respon-
sible for the color arrangements of red,‘
pink, purple, blue, and yellow, the hanging
mosses, the goldfish in the fountains and
ponds. He selected the plants and oversaw
their care -

set a Christ portrait, belonging to 
Betty, the matronly barmaid-owner
of the place. She’s tenderly con-
structed on film as she talks in a
maternal way about some of the
regulars whohave had itbad, and
who she’s helped on occasion. A
little later, in an ironically jolting
scene, she clamors heatedly to one
of her customers about his alcohol-
ism—a remark that, ‘for some
reason, barely disturbs the other
patrons sitting at the bar.

Tony works the mood of the film
into a verite introspection that un-
wraps the comradery for a better
look: we’re suddenly viewing the
chitinous shells of old busybees—
workers now passing their remaining

. days in souring resignation. Betty’s
Corner Cafe packs in the stories of
entire lifetimes into thirteen minutes
on the movie screen.

Sweet Sal, another in-Braddock
production, is a hilarious day-in-they
life account of a street-wise Fonz-

. type character who chatters with a ‘

The Conservatory lies just beyond the en-
trance of Schenley Park, a 10-minute walk

from the Cathedral of Learning, and is-—

itself as fascinating as the plants‘ it houses.

vatory was opened to the public in 1893 and

. reggae and other more obscure

 

By PHYLLIS SIGAL

“I love to play music, and I try
to make it good and keep making it
better so that I know what I’m giv-
ing is good. When people come to
hear my art, they’re not just going
to hear someone singing. They’re
going to get a piece of raw me.”

It may be “raw” Arty that you
get, but it's polished art that you
hear from the stage.

. Arty Tedesco, a powerful singer
and guitarist, can be seen and heard
at various Pittsburgh night spots.

-Arty belts out his songs with not
just "his voice, but his entire body.
His face strains with emotion. His
feet tap an imaginary bass. His
clear, strong voice expresses the
poetic lyrics he_fee_ls so deeply
about.

“I’m a story teller. Music is a
way to apply my real art, the lyrics.
I’m a poet, a lyrical poet,” he says.-

Not always an “orthodox” guitar
player, he uses his acoustic guitar as
a means to say what he must say.

“I would like to think that when
you hear me say something it says
the same thing lyrically as the
melody line says.”

Writing and performing are very
essential to Arty‘.

“I write because I have something
to say, and I perform because I
want to say it,” he adds.

Everything Arty writes comes
directly from his own life.

“Nothing’s made up,” he says.
“All the songs I’ve written are like
pages out of my life.”

Arty has a studio in his attic,
complete with a 4-track tape deck, a
mixing board, a reverb unit, a
power amp, a graphic equalizer,
and BIG speakers. Plus guitars,
guitars, guitars.

    

He sometimes spendstwenty
hours a day in his studio, averaging
8 to ten. He records, writes, prac-
tices guitar, and sings.

Arty feels as if a “constant
magnetic force draws” him there.
“There are some things you have

A Rock’n’roll Enthusiast
Jim’s Records Main Man

By SCOTT MOWRY

Musician. Writer. Record shop
owner. Publisher. Composer. Col-
lector. Rock ’n’ roll entrepreneur.

This impressive batch of titles
belongs to a single man—-Jim Spitz-
nagel—perhaps one of Pittsburgh’s
most ambitious and most dedicated
enthusiast of contemporary rock
,’n’ roll.

At age 29, Jim Spitznagel is a
rare breed among an unhappy and
unmotivated society. He is a
modern day Walter Mitty character

credible fantasies and then con-
secutively brings. them to life.

“Everything I do is for the love
rock ’n’ roll,” he says with a
declaration of enthusiasm. J

Jim is probably most familiar to
Pittsburghers as owner andmanager
of this city's only alternative record

Records,” located on Liberty
Avenue ih Bloomﬁeld.
After selling new wave, punk,

records by day, Jim can be found
absorbed in any number of projects
by night. , "

His bass playing (under stage
pseudonym Jimmy Ramone) for Ed-
die and The Otters, usually occupies
his evening hours. But that’s only
part of his busy lifestyle.

Otherwise, Jim is perpetually
dreaming up new schemes and then '
scrounging his own savings to invest
in’ them. His most recent project
was the establishment of his own . “
recording label, Public Records. _Jim_

hasalsoihelped_ﬁnanceVthe.produc-'  _

."-

tion of Made In Pittsburgh, a
special sampler album composed of
material by ten local bands, in-
cluding Eddie and The Otters.

If that isn’t.enough, Jim has
recently financed Shake and Pop.’, a
monthly new wave fanzine which
began operation last January and
has published four issues to date.

How does one man find the time
and energy to accomplish all this
and more? Simple.

“I want to always be doing
something I can have a lot of fun
with,” Jim says, revealing the secret
to his endles inspiration.

But no, there is more to it than
that. '

“I have to say,” he admits, “I
wouldn’t have been able to do any

Made By Two
Directed by William Turner
Theatre Express

By M.P. TOMEI

Gertrude Stein’s Made By Two receives
an imaginative and humane treatment by
William Turner and Theatre Express. They
create an amusing lyrical opera with the
paradoxical, almost nonsensical semantics
of Stein’s literature.’

However, it is not my intention to delude
the_reader. So, let it be known pronto that
Made By Two would have been tremen-
dously more discernable and possibly more
illuminating had I have ready any of Stein’s
compositions or have seen any of Turner’s
productions. Surprised?

So was I.

The pun-filled dimensions of this musical

tenderly toyed with my cerebral funny-
bone. It is very possible, however, that a
play full of repetitious lines siich as “Half
begun is well done,” or “She with a sheet

of linen and he with a sheet of paper em- L

broider as well,” might have grown hum-
drum in a hurry.

Turner and his company take strides to
outmaneuver the offense of monotony. As
the story unfolds over four decades,
Turner, with the direction of Frank
Johnson, includes his original music—jazz,
swing, and romantic ballads—-authentic to
the respective times. The script would have
been bare and coldly boring without the
colorful score performed by Jeffery Klotz
(alternating with Frank Johnson on dif-
ferent nights), and the vocals, plump wit
rich harmonies. .

The pun-ﬁlled dimensions. . .

And naturally, within the play, the music
would not have sustained its chronological

_relevance without the script. Made By Two

is an autobiographical sketch of Stein’s in-
timate 40-year relationship with Alice
Toklas. The story -is told in retrospect via
an aged Gertrude Stein (Eleanore Glockner)
who recalls the days when the couple, refer-
red to as husband and wife, met up with
resolutions of loneliness, ‘realizations of
self, proscriptions from others and lots of
‘cows’.

Aware of the immensity of Gertrude

Claudia Zahn, Eleanor Glockner and Janet Read in ‘MadeBy Two’

Stein, ‘cows’ are likely to be a reference to
her-and her self image. So, with growing
acceptance and affection from Alice (Janet
Reed), young Gertrude (Claudia Zahn),
while on a picnic surrounded by cows,
tenderly sings, “The cow has come. The
cow has finally come.” One can only
speculate. Manifested in these characters’
portrayal of this relationship is the respect,
kindness, reserve, and wit I imagined to be
appropriate to dissidents of the period dur-
ing the first half of the 20th century.

One brief criticism: even though this

‘Made 33’ TWO’ Auﬁiqlle Musical Autobiography  

 

play deals with a legendary literary giant,
dialogue (and music) shouldn’t be expected
to fill all the gaps. At times the play wasn't

meaty enough. Portions left-me craving for . 0

more details about the character, more in-
sight into the relationship. I was hoping for
the tell-tale memorabilia (props), from

Stein’s bedroom, for example, not more 

blatant spleech. ,
She must have been amazingly complex

to write with such a lucid and absurd '

simpleness. . .a refreshing reminder that
words aren’t limited totheir meanings.

Soho’s‘The Hostage’ Offers Unrestrained Energy ’

The Hostage
Directed by James Gardner
Soho Repertory Theater

By COLLEEN MCDONALD

Energy is the underlying principle behind
Brendan Behan’s The -Hostage, now play-
ing at the Soho Repertory Theater in South
Oakland. Directed by James Gardner, the
performance is designed to shock people
out of their complacent existence—and it
does!

The play takes place in a Dublin brothel
disguised as a lodging house and the cast is
a lively mixture of deliberately caricatured
boarders, ranging from homosexuals to
prostitutes to Irish war heroes. The
characters drift in and out of ‘the bar in
“search of stout, physical comfort and the
odd ballad.” In the same manner, a
vaudevillian raucous-type humor pervades
the scene unrestrained.

The unstructured plot concerns the tak-
ing of a British soldier as hostage by I.R.A.
(Irish Republican Army) agents. In it,
Behan criticizes both religious and national
divisions. - - i

A touching subplot involves the soldier,

relationship with the timid convent girl
Teresa (Laurie Kapner), who acts as a ser-
vant at the brothel. The lovers, overcome
by natural instincts, break down the bar-
riers that society has placed on them.
Behan’s use of language and his play on
words works well with all of his characters.
Pat (John Roell), the proprietor and his
consort, Meg (Barbara Whitney) stabilize
their boarders’ “madness” and act as inter-
preters by addressing the audience with
words of explanation.‘ -
Overall, the show is lively exhibiting wild

Irish jigs, charming brogues, rollicking,

rebel songs and soft ballads. The final act
holds a surprise as the sounds of bombs ex-
ploding, sirens and whistles ringing, and a
blackout heighten’ the effect of a police

_ raid.

The small Soho theater adds to the in-
timacy, for the actors are practically on top
of the audience at times. Gardner’s use of
the acting space is to be commended, for his
cast of 15 (sometimes all on stage at once)
moves about with both vigor and ease.

All the performers see to it that their
parts are well-played, but the focus seems
to be on McWilliams as Leslie, the brash

young British hostage. He claims the atten-

tion of the audience as he woos Teresa and

. teases the I.R.A. soldier. In a final moment

of desperation," as Leslie knows he will be
shot, McWilliams gains the sympathy of all
as his face depicts a terrifying fear.

. The Hostage is a play one must listen to
as well as watch. For despite the

boisterousness and absurdness it carries, ..

some truly realistic undertones prevail.
Behan might be making a_ profound;
political statement or he may be trying to
capture Ireland in its divided» struggle;
whatever it is, Behan succeeds ‘in raising us
to another level of consciousness.

‘Macbeth’ Fails To Elicit  
Feeling Of Mad Tyranny

By MARK HOLAN

Macbeth
Directed by Ben_ Shaktman
Pittsburgh Public Theater

“‘I’ve decided to direct Macbeth because of incidents of terror in Tehran and
Afghanistan. With Shakespeare, I hope to understand it all.” A December, 1979, memo
from Director Ben Shaktman to Julia R. Swoyer, Producer/ Director of the Iron Clad’
Agreement _and Literary advisor for Pittsburgh Public Theater’s production of Macbeth.

“I think Macbeth is going to help our audience understand what it means to create tyran-
nical behavior. I think it will have great contemporary meaning.” From Shaktman’s in-
terview with SHOWCASE (March 25, 1980, Vol. 2, No. 6). —

The world is a stage and good theater does lend insight to events in the real world. Un-
fortunately, PPT’s production of William Shakespeare's classic play of tyranny and
tragedy falls slightly short of matching the present horror and bizarre Islamic despotism in

Iran.

Overall, the production displays the professionalism and polish that Pittsburgh
theatergoers have come to expect from the Allegheny Theater-based company as it closes
its fifth season. Yet if the ideal‘ intention was to help audiences relate to, andbetter

understand,'imposition and invasion in the Middle East, this production is not forceible —

enough to do so. PTT’s Macbeth fails to really grab the audience by the throat, shake them
about and say: “This is what mad tyranny is all about, folks. PTT’s Macbeth does show us
mad tyranny, but not with a capital “M” and a capital “T”!

For example, Tom Atkins, who plays the lead, is a good Macbeth, but never fully
develops into the Tyrannosaurus rex that the part demands. Often he seems like a mad-
man on speed; some of the famous lines are rushed and the poison poetry of his passion
becomes confusion for the audience. .

Conversely, Jean Smart, who plays his wife and accomplice, Lady Macbeth, is too cool
and beautiful to be believable in her power-hungry/status-thirsty party. She comes very
close to really sleepwalking through her character’s most famous scene. There is no blood
on her hands and its difficult to think that there was any to begin with. _

Perhaps the biggest disappointment, however, are the scenes with the three weird
sisters. You never get to see them. Using the Allegheny Theater’s false ﬂoor, set designer
Cletus Anderson has turned these classic scenes into abstract interpretations.

Smoke and fake gnarled hands rise from the basement. The three voices ricochet from - ‘

sundry speakers as a set of kettle drums roll and moan. The approach is interesting indeed
but what fun is “Double, double, toil and trouble/Fire burn and cauldron bubb1e”
through a gridded, sewer like cavity without those three nasty hags to stir a nonexistent

cauldron?

The production’s sparce, staging, as opposed to one which was cluttered, is to clean and

Amerika: June 18-28, 1981 _ at the
Playhouse’s Craft Avenue Theatre. A com-
edy adapted from Franz Kafka’s novel, this
production will be directed by Melanie
Smith.

' With the addition of these five plays, the
Laboratory Theatre will have produced
seven works by Katz, six in a row including
The Possessed. The Lab opened its 78-79
season with Katz’s Finnegans Wake. Three
of this season’s plays, The -Making of
Americans, Swellfoot’s Tears, and

'Amerika,'_were4part of _the Lab Theatre’s
original 79-80 slate. Dracula: Sabbat was
‘originally produced in 1970 at the Judson
Poet’s Theatre in New York‘. The Golem is
Katz’s newest play.

Based on passages from The Kabbalah,
books of medieval Jewish mysticism, The
Golem is the story of a manufactured man.

“The legend itself is the original legend
of Frankenstein’s monster,’-’ explained
Katz. “It involves the creation of a man

out of clay for the purpose of rescuing a .

community from its oppressors. The em-
phasis is very much on the terror involved
with the legend.” ‘ '

“It is a terrifying piece,” emphasized
director John-Michael Tebelak, who was in
town last Thursday_. “There’s a great deal
of ritualism in the piece. The style is very
formalized and, although it is a somewhat
Eastern kind of theater, what we're going
to try to do is create a unique style of our
own to evoke the sense of mystery.

“To achieve terror in the theater, to real-
ly have the hair on the back of your head
stand up, means that we have to capture the
audience in a totally foreign world. The
challenge for me as a director is going to be

all of the subtleties presented in the play.
The Mattress Factory’s intimate acting
area provides the perfect compliment to the
‘Sagamore Hill set. Large animal heads,
stuffed birds, pelts and antlers, a huge oak
desk, a ‘tapestry woven rug, red and gold
brocade curtains and original family
photographs mesh to form a replica of
Roosevelt’s office -in his Oyster Bay home.
The set is not totally realistic. Off to the
side are a woodpile and rowboat which are
used by Wisniski as he tells the adventure.
The actor-director of the play, Wisniski ad-
dresses his 24 “viewless companions” as if

of actors, so that they are able to capture
the audience and encircle them in this
world.” ’
Tebelak is a native Pittsburgher and a
graduate of Carnegie-Mellon University.
He conceived and directed the original
Broadway production of Godspell. In New

York, Tebelak is currently developing a .

"religious/philosophical" theater at the

“The Lab Theatre’s back in full—scale

they were on stage.

There is no chronological order to the
play’s series of reminiscent clips but the ac-
tion is cohesive because of the many
beautiful transitions used during the course
‘of the play. One especially effective transi-
tion is a gunshot in the second act as
Roosevelt is shot in the chest. Immediately,
after the gunshot, prolonged strobe lighting

' is projected on Wisniski and the effect is
that of an old fashioned moving picture,
similar to that of waving a ﬂashlight on a
moving object.

The‘ many historical references of
Roosevelt’s big game hunting days and his
clashes with the machine bosses direct the
audiences attention upon both Roosevelt’s
forthright and adventurous manner.

Wisniski exerts a tremendous amount of‘ —

energy moving across the stage in leaps and
softshoe. The “gleam of teeth and ﬂash of
glasses” are not left to the viewer’s im-
agination. At times, Wisniski resembles his
character exactly in gesture, facial expres-

_sion and posture. Wisniski is like a wonder— .

fully enthusiastic grandfather telling his life

story to a. group of youngsters. He brings a -

vitality to Roosevelt, the family man.

But Roosevelt is also “in the buff” in
Bully. He is revealed in “naked truth” by
Wisniski. A ‘first act scene _showed
Roosevelt recapturing the feelings as his
first wife, Alice, dies. The audience is silent
as Wisniski gives a powerfully moving
display of Roosevelt’s love for another.
Alden is a poet here and one can not help
seeing the “light go from Roosevelt’s life,”
at this point. ~ .

The play’s final scene depicts Roosevelt’s '

additional dejection as he reflects on the
death of his son, Quentin. A desperation
replaces the spark in Wisniski"s voice. and,
the last teddy bear is thrown to the audience
-with the words, “look sharp!”

‘Nosferatu’ More Than

Nosferatu
Directed by Werner Herzog

By THOMAS PALMER

It’s the sign of a good director. The way
he can take a subject, any subject, and put
it effectively on the screen. The way he, at
one minute, can make it seem like a spoof,
and then just as suddenly sink the viewer-
;"_‘*_=,erly back into his seat.

Nosferatu moves us up and down this
scale, making us laugh and cringe in spite of
ourselves.

Klaus Kinski plays the totally revamped
Dracula: ice white skin, large flowery ears
and a full-moon head. He is not the tradi-
tionally romantic figure Frank Langella

took from the stage and brought to the
screen with director John Badham. Her-
zog’s Dracula physically portrays the terror
he represents, despite the fact that this
demon from the blackness of Hell is virtual-
ly latex white. Something other than
Dracula lurks in this German remake.

Stylistically, the film is perfect. It looks,
at times, as if Herzog canvassed hundreds
of old horror flicks, taking basic angles and
shots and incorporating them into his film.
This Dracula is full of traditional directorial
devices that make it enchanting and, at
times, humorous, but they areadone with
such ease of style that the film runs like an ’

T old song done with a beautiful new arrange-

-/I’

merit.

Isabelle Adjani plays Lucy, the young
German wife of the classic Jonathan
Harker (Bruno Ganz). Lucy, a woman with
the eyes of a New Wave Lillian Gish, seems

to be the only one that realizes the horror _

Dracula has brought to their small German
town after he decides to relocate from his
Transylvania castle. It is she, a young
woman pure of heart, who must bring
about his downfall.

‘Little Darlin
Innocence And Young Women

Let’s talk about sex-. Sometimes it’s hard
to decide who has the rougher time of it,
‘men or women. Better yet, let’s talk about
sex- dealt with on an intelligent level in
cinema, something which does not occur in
Little Darlings. Writers Kimi Peck and

 Dalene Young must have been excited with
 the premise of this film; two lovely young

girls competing for a loss of chastity that
immediately broadcasts to the viewer the
upcoming anxiety, cuteness, and hollow
disappointment some will feel at the loss of
innocence; two adolescent actresses with

  

The Vampyre (Klaus Kinski) and his victim Lucy (Isabelle Adjani)

. . .the ﬁlm runs like an old song with a new arrangement.‘

Herzog reigns very dominant in the film.
His characters are right from the pages and

screens of past vampire adventures, thus-

setting him free to roam the audience with
his classic structure. The conformity allows
him to raise hideous shadows along sides of
houses (so reminiscent of The Cabinet of
Dr. Caligart) that we are more engrossed
than annoyed with things that are far from
atypical. _

Very seldom does he deviate from this
norm,‘ and those times are some very short,
slow-motion stanzas of a bat: close, soft
and blue, like a brief verse on the screen.
But he cuts back to the regular «pace of the
film before we’re able to immerse ourselves
into it. He forces us to rely onrour memory
of it until theright moment when he does it
once again to us. —

Also exciting is his delicate. expanse, an

  ‘NothingPersonal’ Repeats  

A Tried and True Formula

Nothing Personal ' _ -
Directed By George Bloomfield

-.

By JANE HOLAHAN

Successful movies ‘usually create clones

' sooner or later, and The Electric Horseman

seems to have had its first child'—a rather
lame film entitled Nothing Personal. Clone
movies usually aren’t much of anything,
particularly when the movie being cloned
wasn’t much to begin with. This time it has
baby seals that have to be saved from the
big, evil corporation instead of race horses,
and instead of first class actors Robert Red-
ford and Jane Fonda, it’s got Donald

Sutherland, who looks like he would rather’

be home asleep, and Suzanne Somers, of
Three’s Company fame. The film, thought
pleasant enough, can’t shirk off the feeling
of being secondhand news, like it was made
for_ TV.

Donald Sutherland is a hip _college pro-
fessor (he smokes marijuana) who becomes
obsessed with saving the baby seals that are

being killed by the Dawson Corporation. A
They want to build a defense plant where.

the seals live, but since seals are an en-
dangered species Sutherland is upset. In

fact, he’s supposed to be so distraught that »

he leaves his job at Anywhere USA Univer-

sity (where his class applauds him after»

every lecture—they must be remembering
M*A*S"'l-I) to go to Washington, D.C. to
talk to the board members of the Dawson
Corporation about their killing these cute
little seals. Sutherland’s reaction to the
baby seals’ plight consists of saying, “But
it’s illegal,” like he just got an unfair park-
ing ticket, .and, “They can’t do this,”
before he nods off to sleep. His perfor-
mance is the ﬂip side of Redford’s in the
Electric Horseman, whose laidback attitude
was part o.f the character. Sutherland’s per-
formance just seems lazy and annoying.

Then comes the ‘Jane Fonda angle.
Deciding he needs a lawyer, in the long
tradition of “cute” movie meetings,

- Sutherland looks for the first name in the

Yellow Pages, which turns out to be Abigal
Adams (Somers)! Abigal graduated magna
cum laude from Radcliffe, but she hasn’t

had one client yet. (You figure being the_ _

first name in the yellow, pages‘she’_d have

millions, but then, you figure Jane Fonda
would have better things to do with her time
than hang around a Las Vegas nightclu
looking for news.) '
Although Somers has never had a client,
she immediately offers to take this case for
free (she’sicommitted to the cute seals) and
she and Sutherland set off for adventure
and romance. Being liberated, she takes in-

itiative, seeing how Sutherland doesn’t_

seem much interested in anything anyway.
In fact, next to Sutherland’s lackluster per-
formance, she’s great, but the sparks that
flew from Redford and Fonda just aren’t
there.’

As these two wild, but committed, kids

come up against the big corporation board _

members, we are supposedto get to know
and love them through their wild, but com-
mitted, shenanigans. But we never do. They
remain as superficial and uninteresting as
they always were. The most interesting

' thing in the movie is the old hotel

Sutherland stays at when he first comes to
Washington, D.C.

Everyone on the board at Dawson Cor-
poration is ruthless, so they try to
blackmail‘our heroes, but it doesn’t work
because our heroes are too honest for that.

Next, they try to burn them to death in a '

barn (this rnoviegis rather strange—the bad
guys have the funniest lines) but our heroes
win out in the end.

Unfortunately, Nothing Persona! has one ,.
of. those ambiguous endings which says, “If *’

we make over $2 million profit, we’ll be
back with’a sequel and lots more FUN!”

The script is dumb, and the performances V

are rather uninspired (it’s hard to be in-

spired for a whole movie about seals)._

There are_ some pretty scenes from
Washington," D.C., and Suzanne Somers
has a great wardrobe—just don't ask where
she gets all her money.

Unlike the Electric Horseman, whose
priorities at least are in the right place, the
end of Nothing Personal has.the corporate
board members (who just got finished try-
ing to murder Sutherland, Somers and an
innocent Indian chief in a burning barn)
sneakily setting out to kill polar bears in
Alaska (it’s for thesequel, I guess). Well, at
least the cute little seals were saved. What
else could you want? '

Sara Stimson, Julie Andrews and Walter Matthau in ‘Little Miss Marker’

 

. . .boredom has little chance to breed.

Little Miss Marker L
Directed by Walter Bernstein

By M. P. TOME!

Can the innocence and love of a six-year-
old, brown-eyed ‘doll’ triumph over the
heartless skepticism of a wry and whizened
bookie? Certainly. ’ Walter Bernstein,
director and screenwriter of the fourth
remake of “Little Miss Marker,” recreates
a romantic -comedy from the '30s that
allows the “happy ending” to stick around.

From the beginning, one senses the “hap-.

py ending”—-especially if one knows it was
once a Shirley Temple movie. One also
senses the plot will remain simple. Never-

.theless, boredom has little chance to breed.

Walter Matthau, with his sardonic manner
and great one-liners (“If that horse was‘ the
only horse in the race, it would still come in
last—and even then it would have to come

-from behind”), makes sure of that. Mat-

thau portrays the caustic, callous, stingy
and very serious Sorrowful Jones, a race
horse bookie who gets saddled with “The

The Flawless Wit Of Martin Mull   A L
‘Serial’ A Funny F arcical Look At Suburb Liberals

Serial
Directed by Bill Persky

By DAVID E. STUBBS .

Serial, no matter what you may have read
or heard, is a well-directed overall smash.

. The film is set in a somewhat unrealistic

corporate high-class suburb in a community
full of over-sophisticated liberals who are
so into their karmas and “maintaining their
proper space” that they lose nearly all sense
of reality in the shufﬂe.
Harvey (Martin Mull) is a conventional
character in an unconventional setting who
doesn’t care about the things his peers do.

Harvey is under a lot of pressure from his ~

wife Kate (Tuesday Weld) who is constantly
calling him hostile and angry. His teenage
daughter is also mixed up in this make-
believe world of over-liberalism.

The characters are developed through
well-written contradictions of their extreme

liberalisms and maritial instabilities. Serial"

also contains some truly well-written and
delivered dialogue. It has some classic one-
liners delivered with seemingly ﬂawless wit.
Of course, Mull gets to say some of the
more interesting things, mostly because he
is the character that does not fit. Some of
his more well-delivered lines: “Kate, you
get being liberated mixed up with being a
bitch,” or the classic, “What’s interface, a
new word for oral sex?”

_ Make no mistake, this movie is filled with
a lot of upper-class sexism. But the sexism
is presented with rare taste. Complete with
two nymphomaniacs, wife swapping, an
orgy, a weekend corporate homosexual
who hangs out with a motorcycle gang
(Christopher Lee), a women’s con-
sciousness raising group, freestyle weddings
and a religious cult—this movie has it all.

Throughout Serial, Harvey and Kate play
the old game of girl meets boy, loses boy,
and finds him again. Harvey has a good
time of it sexually, even though he really

to lose her virginity (a euphemism for-

womanhood to these girls). To take the film

seriously leaves one sick, forcing them to"

visualize frustrated teenagers all over
America with new fuel for their libido.
Sweet love is easier than they think. To take
it as just entertaining fun makes one even
sicker. Maxwell tries to take a delicate stage
in life and deal with it in vulgar humor. It is
easy to see how fragile this idea is. The ﬁlm
can’t survive without lapsing into tense
scenes of regret. A

It is hard to believe that the intentions
behind this film were all warped with a
sense of profit. If anything, Maxwell, Peck
and Young do relay a sense of ugly peer
pressure among youth. Yet, by the end of
the film, one can’t help feel that this is lost,
-that the blame can only be dumped on the
. two main characters. .

The (brightest spot ‘is Kristy . McNichol.

There is a fresh abandon in her acting that
makes her exciting to watch. Besides look-
ing great in a tank top, one can’t help but
notice a germ of talent growing in her
warm, moist _ personality; she has a nice
delivery for her lines and an eye that cocks
with all the emphasis of Burt Reynolds. The
only thing that she needs practice in is
lighting cigarettes.

‘Tatum O’Neal-does not fare so well.
Looks, although she has plenty of them,

. can’t carry her starchy acting. She seems

too animated, like she's pouting with every
word. Seeing her soaked during a rainstorm
creates an incredible ﬂashback to her Paper
Moon days, but that precociousness can no
longer support her.

Little Darlings should have never been
made. There is enough future for both girls
to have passed it by, since nothing would
have been lost. Nothing.

incing Shirlem

Kid” (Sara Stimson), whom he has ac-
cepted as a “marker” until her dad returns
with the money, which, of course, he never
does. Matthau’s role, very unlike his only

suit, is tailor-made; no one else would fit as «

well. It’s remarkable how subtlely he
transforms the gravity of his role into levity
for the viewer’s pleasure. '

Tony Curtis, as Blackie, the thug with
whom Sorrowful reluctantly becomes part-
ners, doesn’t pull this off so well. His
character isn’t as amusingly convincing.
Despite this, he is impossible not to hate-

just plays along—with his wife, secretary
and a young teenage nymph.

For all the confusion and unconvention-
ality of Serial, it all works out to a neat, yet
unsuspected conclusion. Harvey gets his
life and family together through the use of

le Remake

to assure Sorrowful it would be in his best
interest to become his (Blackie’s) associate,
he shoots Sorrowful’s dog. Because of Sor-
rowful’s obvious disdain for Blackie, we
know he is basically a good guy. Still, he’s
no hero and he gives Blackie the requested
funds. Blackie needs Sorrowful’s money in
order to finance a casino with Amanda
(Julie Andrews), a delicately charming
widow, impossible not to fall in love with.

But regardless of her romantic«suggestiof§‘f~

toward Sorrowful, he remains unsuscept-,

ible to human emotional folly.

It’s as though all of these characters are

included primarily to clarify and enhance ,

Matthau’s_ role. Matthau is the star. Bob
Newhart as Regret, Sorrowful’s not-too-
bright assistant, is another example. His
character serves mainly to show
Sorrowful’s independence. ._Newhart is
okay, but certainly not worth more than
three sentences.

The only one who can activate Sor-
rowful’s dormant heart is “The Kid.” She
does so without even trying. Sara Stimson,
in her first role ever, has quite an unpreten-
tious and captivating style. Her unsophis-
ticated sweetness gradually seeps into Sor-
rowful’s heart, taking him places he never
dreamed of going.

“Little Miss Marker” offers a light-
hearted comedy without being “too cute.”
Though well written, the script" is not Oscar
material. Nevertheless, Stimson is a treat,
And_rew’s clothes are splendid, and Mat-
thau' is a star!

good, old-fashioned values such as love,
determination and courage. This highly
funny and entertaining serial couldn’t bore
anybody although it could offend the sex-
ually squeamish. As movies go, Serial is
near ﬂawless and well worth seeing at any
price.

Ballet Season Cls Wi  ell-ed 

 SUSAN COLWELL

Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre
Celebration, Icarus, Portraits
.Heinz Hall

March 28, 29, 30, -1980

The Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre closed its
tenth anniversary season with a presenta-
tion of two world premieres by Artistic,

’ Director Patrick Frantz and a Pittsburgh
premier, Lucas Hoving’s Icarus. The pro-
gram was well-rounded in styles, ranging
from the purely modern Icarus to the
modern, but based in the classical, Celebra-
tion to the classical Portraits.

Celebration, first on the program, was set
to Carl Orff’s Veni Creator Spiritus, and
Patrick Frantz captured the drama and in-
tensity of the music very nicely-in his ensem-
ble choreography. But the choreography
required great precision, and this was not

I quite carried off by the dancers, perhaps
because the conductor could not see them.

Pitt’s own Heinz Chapel Choir, con-
ducted by Grover Wilkins, stood at the
back of the stage, behind a scrim with the
musicians, and sang Franz Werfel’s text to
Orff’s work. The striking visual effect was ,
worth the small drop in performance quali-
ty.

A highlight of Celebration was a silent
dance between two men, Miguel Cam-‘
paneria dressed in black and Keith Martin
in white. It was a fascinating conception of
a duel between two forces, with only minor
‘timing errors by the two gifted dancers.
Although the silence emphasized the high
intensity of the piece, even to hearing the
heavy breathing of the dancers (the stage
microphones were still on), it showed the
attitude of the audience as well, and there

‘Abstract Exp

By JAN MCLAUGHLIN A

It can’t be said that there is not a feel of
New York in Pittsburgh. Try the Abstract
Expressions Gallery at 311 South Craig
Street. It integrates a well thought-out,
selective, and refreshing view of art.

-T he hope of director Richard Jacobson is
that Abstract Expressions will provide a
gallery where top-quality art can be ex-
perienced. This does not exclude talented
Pittsburgh artists, but rather opens up fresh
channels in the sometimes homogeneous at-

’ mosphere of Pittsburgh.

His basic premise is not to have an elite
collection of famous names in the art
world but to implement and expose the

Next came Icarus, which began with the

distracting. Then once again, two men
(Bruce Paul Michelson as Daedalus, and

‘Roberto Rodriguez as Icarus) danced

together. The style was definitely modern,
concentrating on slow and controlled
movements to intense Japanese music.
Perhaps too intense, as the shufﬂings and
coughs increased again, but these faded

collected from New York and abroad. ‘

Some works presently on display include

prints, but within each frame the print has
been folded into three separate rectangular
planes that weigh out and distribute purple
and green shapes.

yellow; browns and blues. A free-form

it energy and separation.

It’s‘ a 25-minute gem depicting a
segment in the life of .a new-used

J. (Jimmy) Roy is a man baptized
in the spiritual platitudes of Nor-
man Vincent Peale and other
ideologic hucksters of the American
Dream. He has a bit of trouble
running the store on these lofty sen-
timents, and becomes the symbolic‘

. embodiment of a runner on the
Protestant Ethics team who col-
lapses on the track at the U.S.
Open Dream turf. But he keeps
getting back up to run (twelve times
in his career) toward the unseen
finish line.

Regarding J. Roy, Tony reflects,
“It seems everybody knows so-
meone_exact1y like him in their
town. And then again, J. Roy
makes some people a little nervous
because they see a little of his

. daydreaming in themselves.”

z.z. Topi/The Rockets
Civic Arena
March 26, 1980

By\JOHN RUS,NAK_

Texas is famous for a lot of things:
calculators, the Dallas Cheerleader, oil, and

l . also, Z.Z. Top. In the early ’70s the band

started playing for small audiences in their

but the rest of the country didn’t pay much

” attention to them".

In 1975, the band’s fourth album, Fan-

‘. dango, opened.‘ up many. cars, especially

since one side of the album was recorded
live, hot, and spontaneous, presented

“honestly without the assistance of studio
gimmicks. Many people felt the energy that
the band had on record and the Texas trio
became a huge concert attraction.

After completing their ’76 Texas
Worldwide Tour, Z.Z. Top stopped. What
started out as a couple of months of relaxa-
tion turned into years of vacationing. It
wasn’t until May of last year that the band
was back together and in the studio recor-
ding Deguello, their latest album.

It has been four years since the band ap-
peared in public. We are to expect no

' ticipation the appearance of the band on
stage. The lights were off, the lighters on.
As everyone started yelling for the band,

, slow Texan-cowboy-style music came out

hatted crowd. As the music slowly started

dience. -

With no introduction, Billy Gibbons,
Dusty Hill, and Frank Beard appeared on
stage wearing stark white and basic black
and began rocking down the Arena. No
cowboy hats. No animals.’ No cacti. In-
stead, the members of Z.Z. Top wore suits
and looked shockingly different. Beard, the
drummer, sported a neater, feathered,
blow-cut instead of his stringy long hair of
the past, while Gibbons and Hill .showed
off their too long, too conspicuous beards
throughout the show. The‘ band seemed to

' have retired their old stage show along with
their old outward appearances. The‘ new

stage ﬂoor was made of lights that produc-
ed pictures of everything from moving
musical notes to dancing geometric shapes.
The band’s logo was a sign made of crystal
lights that looked like burning ﬂames. No
other props were used during the show.
Rather,’ just a lot ‘of boogie rock ’n’ roll.
Pittsburgh was deﬁnitely glad to see Z.Z.
Top back in concert and the band seemed
glad to be playing, too. Gibbons, guitarist
and lead vocalist, had a magical rapport
with the fans, soaking up all the rockin’
that they could squeeze out of him. The
band was in top shape that night and put on
an excellent performance. Hill and Gibbons
choreographed the majority of the songs
and had every movement down to the last
riff. Included in their; repertoire of tunes
were “Heard It On The X,” “La Grange,”

“Jesus Just Left Chicago,” and “Arrested ‘ ’

for Driving While Blind.” From the minute
Z.Z. Top was on stage, they captured the
audience’s attention. It was a rompin’
stompin’ show from that little ol’ band
from Texas doing new songs like “I’m Bad

 

  
 

. . .vivacity, power, and what, no encore?

Orange Lake Drive Offered 

Unrelenting Excellence

By CHRIS RASMUSSEN

Toward the end of the term, many students needed to unwind a little, and unwind they

did at a recent ‘concert of the Michigan-based Orange Lake Drive, a sometimes-jazz,

sometimes-rock, otherwise-fusion band, whose, sole purpose seems to be based on

delighting audiences across America.‘

Pittsburgh was no exception. An audience of 500lwas captured instantly by the group’s

‘ .vivacity, power, and unrelenting excellence. Thanks to the Pitt Union Program Council,

  

which sponsored the performance, there was nothing to be found but nodding heads, tapp-
ing feet, and copious bursts of well-deserved applause. And those 500 were thankful that

they had come.

Orange Lake Drive is an unusual band: all of them lead, yet all of them follow. Itseems
that today, jazz groups rarely feature everyone onstage, not overemphasizing any one
member, any one instrument. This refreshing philosophy is what gives Orange ‘Lake

Drive its overwhelming acceptance.

Yes, the band plays originals, and they are excellent, high-spirited ones. Yes, they play
songs by other artists, and they perform them incredibly well. And yes, the group is tight,

like seeds in an orange.

The first half of the concert was dominated by excellent original compositions by Steven
Schuetz (synthesizer and keyboards), and Laura Thompson (lead vocalist). They did not,
by any means, emphasize their own instruments, but allowed ample solo efforts by Ross

 4 " ‘ Pooley, whose playing was ﬂuid. Thompson's voice was fine and very clear. Schuetz’s

work on thefour banks of keyboards was admirable. On drums, Andy Combs was
magnificent, propelling the others into an undeniably beautiful musical realm. And Ken-
ny Burch’s bass work was fabulous, to say the least.
The highlights of the evening were numerous: Weather Report’s “Birdland,” Kenny
Loggins’ “Wait a Little While,” and Chick Corea’s “Open Your Eyes, You Can Fly,”
just to name a few. But in all, every song was beautifully executed, leaving no dull
-moments during the nearly two-hour performance.
" The only complaint that could be registered was that the Program Council unjustly

of the concert belonged to frontmen.Hill
and Gibbons. Frank Beard _wasn’t in the
spotlight at all. He just sat back, did his
drumming, and took it all in quietly.
Overall, it was an explosive concert, even
without the help from the frequent
fireworks in the crowd. The show was very
cleaned-up, fresh, and slick in its produc-
tion. _

The last cadence was not enough for the
worked-up audience, though, calling, for
an excellent encore, which consisted of

“Tush” and “She Likes My Automobile.”
When a film of the band playing sax-
ophones was projected on a screen during
the final number, the band on stage played
along with it.

The opening act, The Rockets, also put
on a fine performance. Doing hits like
“Oh, Well,” the band was warmly welcom-
ed by the audience. At one point, the lead
singer asked the audience, “Ya love that

rock-n-roll shit, don't cha?”

Yes, indeed. Rock and roll lives in Pitt- _ -

sburgh, and both bands proved that.

Callins And Friends Explore
Exciting Jazz Spectrum

.Jothan Callins and Friends
The Portfolio
April 3, 1980
By PHYLLIS SIGAL

. JAZZ: Improvised music that produces a
definite feeling. ‘
What kind of feeling? Fun. Finger-

. snapping. Toe-tapping. Head-bobbing.

Sometimes you feel it deep inside. You
feel ‘your heart pumping andayour blood
ﬂowing. You know exactly what the music
is telling you. .

Jothan Callins and Friends offered three
evenings of the. full scope of -jazz. Contem-

porary. Traditional. Original. Classical. ~

. J onthan’s “Friends” included: Herman
Green blowing tenor sax and ﬂute;,, Gerri
Allen fingering piano; Chris Sullivan
thumping bass; Roger Humphries brushing
and‘ beating drums; and Callins switching
between ﬂugel horn and trumpet.

Much of their playing sounded polytonal
and polyrhythmical—the African inﬂuence
in jazz music. Instead of having one tone or
one rhythm, the songs had many. This gave

‘the performance a disharmonious or a

freeform quality. \

Each musician seemed to be playing his
own separate interpretation, but the music
blended enough to form a wonderful jazz
composition. ,

In many songs, each musician had -his
own spotlight. The solos invited audience
applause, which was given willingly.

The band played a few well-known tunes,

including “Soul Eyes” and “Softly as a
Morning Sunrise,” by John Coltrane,
“Maiden Voyage” by Herbie Hancock,
and “Grand Valse” by Booker Little.
' They also played several original com-
positions. “Isola‘tion” by Green featured
Green on the ﬂute. The song was reminis-
cent of a slow dance tune from the Big
Band era. Special guest star Green came
from Memphis to join the band for the per-
formances. ‘

In a composition by Callins, “Wind of
Change,” the bold clarity of Callin’s
trumpet sounded very much‘ like
background music in‘ a storm scene. It’s.

—. - rarevthat a musician can take you from the’

1 .

bar and put you into the center of a storm.

. But not a rare quality of Callin’s.

Allen, at times, sounded like a concert
pianist—classically powerful. In her solo on
“Wind of Change,” she made the grand
piano shake as her fingers whipped across
the keys. ‘ ‘

Another original b by Callins, “The
’ 80s,”'was introduced by Callins.

“Let’s see if we can make this a better
world in the ’ 80s,” he said.

A’ fanfare announced the coming of the
new decade. Callin’s “ﬂourish” of his
trumpet was excellent.

' The song had a fast tempo and seemed to
have a positive attitude. »

Chris Thompson on bass was as en-
joyable to watch as he was to listen to.’ His
face moved almost as much as his fingers
did as he played an acoustic bass. He also
played electric bass.

Humphries, a fine drummer in his own

right, seemed a bit incongruous in this
group of “Friends.” Sometimes his drums
overpowered the other performers’ solos.
The crowd was large and " energetic.
Everywhere you looked someone was mov-

. ing with the music.

“We’re trying to bring good music to
Pittsburgh,” Callins said. “I~ feel that in
order for jazz to survive, musicians have to
continue to perform and have places to go
where people can go to hear it.”

The performances at the Portfolio were
recorded by Triumph Records. ,_

Callins started the record companyabout
five years ago, “to give musicians a. chance
to record music like they want to record it,
to give musicians some control,” said
Callins. He feels that many large record
companies deny musicians their individual
expression.

The musicians have played with such jazz
greats as Lionel Hampton, Miles Davis,
Coltrane and Lonnie Liston Smith. '

Allen and Callin are currently instructors
of Jazz 84 recitation sections at Pitt. They
also are members of Pitt’s Jazz Ensemble,
directed by Nathan Davis.

Three cheers for the Portfolio and these
fine musicians for giving us three nights of
great jazz! _ ‘ ’

Pittsburgh Gets Funked-Up
Stanley Theatre Plays Host
To Parliament And Bar-Kays

By DAVID STUBBS '

Bar Kays/Von Mason
Stanley Theatre
March 29, 1980

‘  - The stage was all set for the return of one

of Pittsburgh’s favorite live acts—the Bar
Kays. It was a misty Saturday night, but

you could feel it in the air that the night was _

going to be something special.’

It was 8:30 and the Stanley was slowly
filling. The sound system was filling the air
with the music of the Brothers Johnson.
The lights dimmed and the warm-up act,
Von Mason, began his set. _

Most of the Stanley audience took this
act lightly, and really did not listen at first.
But like any good band, Von Mason made
the audience listen. The group was very
tight, clear and funky.

His show started and ended with two dif-

4 ferent versions of the big Pittsburgh

favorite “Rock Skate.” The musicians of
this band were truly amazing: a bass player
who doubles on vocals and harmonica, a
lead guitarist and conga man who were
great soloists, an excellent keyboardist,
another guitarist who doubles on bass, two
lead singers, a drummer, and leader Von
Mason, who also plays drums.

The Bar Kays, led by vocalist Larry Dod-
son, wasted little time as they started with a
hit from their new album, “More and
More.” The tune pumped and showed by
the end of the concert that the only phrase
that would fit this show was ‘off the wall.’
The Bar Kays continued their set of about
15 tunes with the big hit “Shine.” “Shine”?
was flawless with the Bar Kays’ new and i ‘
proved tight sound, and Dodson’s always
strong voice, with the added attraction of a
crystal ball hanging from the ceiling, which
lit up the stage every time the word ‘shine’
was sung in the chorus.

For the next six tunes the band gradually‘

mellowed out. The songs in this part of the
show included “Today is the Day,” “I
Love the Way You Love,” “Party Down,”
“Light At The End of The Tunnel,” and
two others. During this time the audience
seemed to be either in awe of the Bar Kays’
talent or falling asleep waiting for the Bar
Kays’ big hits which (little did they know)
were ready to hit them momentarily. 4
After Dodson accused Pittsburgh of fall-
ing asleep, the band kicked into a medley of
past hits from the albums “Too Hot To
Stop,” and “Flying High On Your Love.”
The medley started with “Shake Your
Rump To The Funk,” the hit that started
the Bar Kays’ comeback in 1976. Next was
the laid-back funky “Spellbound” from the
“Too Hot To Stop” album. The medley
continued with “Attitudes,” which wound
down slowly before the Bar Kays prepared
to ‘knock the concert off the wall again!
Everyone knew the concert wouldn’t last

too much longer, but they also knew the
Bar Kays had at least two more big hits left.

The first was the massive Pittsburgh hit
“Holy Ghost.” “Holy Ghost”faded into
“Feel It,” and then came another highlight
of the show when drummer Mike Beard em-
barked on his famous ten-minute drum
solo. The mark of a true funk band lies in
their ability to hit it and quit it when it
counts. The Bar Kays took five seconds
after the drum solo, dimmed the lights, and
jumped off the wall into their latest smash
hit, "Move Your Boogie Body” from the
“Injoy” album. As "Move Your Boogie

Body” faded out, the Bar Kays were saying

their goodbyes, and everybody seemed
satisfied and happy.

The Brides of Funkenstein
Parliament/Funkadelic
Stanley Theatre

Since Funkadelic’s first album, recorded
_in 1969, the Parliafunkadelicment Thang
has grown from a little-known acid band to
a mlulti-group, multi-million dollar semi-
corporation. Thang, Inc. has produced 34
albums to date with more on the way. Of
‘those albums, 13' are Funkadelic albums,
produced consistently since ’69 even though

. they weren’t' selling very well (only two
Funkadelic albums are gold, One Nation A

Under A Groove and Uncle Jam Wants
You), The reason Funkadelic wasn’t selling
was because the music was too nasty,lhard-
core and‘ innovative to sell well ‘to a large
commerical‘ public. The music the group
records on the Funkadelic label is still the
group’s most creative music.

As for the concert, it was a good showing
of talent, theatrics, and just plain ‘giving up
the funk.’ ‘

The Brides of Funkenstein performed so
fast you could have almost forgotten they
were there. The brief show featured the
powerfully rhythmic .“Party Up Here,” the
smooth ballad “Didn’t Mean To Fall In
Love,” .a rushed, short-cut version of the
title cut from their latest LP, “Never Buy

Texas From A Cowboy,” and ended with .

their big hit “Disco To Go.”
Following the brief intermission with

Parliament’s road comedian, the show

began with a new Parliament cartoon

, movie. This one featured the story of

Gloryhallastoopid. The show started hard
and fast with the musical theme from Alice
In My Fantasies, immediately followed by
the classic “Cosmic Slop.” The next song
was the big hit, “The Big Bang Theory” as
the Baltimore Connection Horns were pum-
ping, out that well-known, highly syn-
copated horn line, and the fans went crazy.

best, and the audience was giving up the
two-ﬁnger funk sign everywhere.

“One Nation Under A Groove” was next
as the Funkadelic rhythm section and
singers showed their stuff. This song was
made for Gary Shider, as he proceeded to
fill the unfillable shoes’ of George Clinton.
“Aqua Boogie” was next. Even though it
was a big success on record, the studio ver-
sion just can’t touch the uncut funkiness of
its live performance. “Aqua Boogie” also
included a medley with “Liquid Sunshine.”

Showing their versatility and style, the
mob took a brief break and then broke into
a hardcore jam set featuring the guitar work
of Dewayne McKnight (formerly of the
Headhungers) and Mike ‘Kidd Funkadelic’
Hampton. Maceo Parker (of the Horny
Horns) made an appearance as he ~ joked
and did a little bit of cheerleading. He pull-
ed out a flute and made a short improvisa-

tional lead into Funkadelic’s classic lead .

guitar display, “Maggot . Brain.” The
spotlight was once again on Mike Hamp-
ton. He toyed around a little and then got
down to a serious ten-minute solo which
stunned the crowd. Hampton is known for
being quiet and expressionless, but
throughout the night, as he played beautiful
solos, he looked more bored than anything
else.

“Mothership Connection,” ‘always show I
' stopper was no‘ exception. Live “Mother-

ship Connection” always features the lan-

_ ding of the holy mothership. The Stanley

was too small to do this in, but the band
and the fans acted it out anyway. “Mother
Connection” also featured a medley of
“Party People” and “Rumpofsteelskin.”
After the rather lengthy “Mothership,”
Shider and the mob played around with a
medley of “The Theme From The Black

Hole” and ' “Gloryhallastoopid” before_

bass vocalist Ray Davis and Shider started
the verse of “The Theme From The Black
Hole”. ‘

The band acted as if they were trying to
leave, but Pittsburgh wanted more. The
band came back out and hit the crowd with
Parliament’s first gold single “Give Up The
Funk” and finally “Night of the Thum-
pasorus'Peoples.” At the end, the stage was
full of musicians, roadies, security person-
nel, giving up that P-Funk, better known as
the bomb.

The strange thing about this show was.

that, as good as it was, it was performed‘ by

Ronstadt’s Arena Show :
New Look And New Sound    

By MYRLE KAYE

Linda Ronstadt/Danny Kortchmar
Civic Arena
April 7, -1980 T

Linda Ronstadt did more than cut her hair since her last visit to Pittsburgh. She’s tap-
ped into fresh sounds with fresh energy and has found yet another outlet for her strong,

emotion-packed voice.

V ‘Saturday, May.31: Triumph. Stanley Theatre.

 

' When Ronstadt appeared at the Civic Arena two and a half years ago, her opening act
was Stephen Bishop. Known for a lazily melodic hit single “On and On,” Bishop wore a
genteel white suit and included in his set a guitar version of “Somewhere Over the Rain-
bow.” Ronstadt follwed him with a.competent but somehow lifeless concert, concen-
trating on the material from her album Simple Dreams. —

The changes in Ronstadt since 1977 reflected in the opening act for her April 7 perfor-
mance at the Civic Arena. Ronstadt’s lead guitarist Danny Kortchmar appeared with his

band. He wore a black t-shirt, jeans, and red tennis shoes and played a set of straight- _

forward, scaled-down rock ‘n’ roll. Kortchmar’s band not only looked like a bunch of
neighborhood boys jamming together, they sounded that way, too, not offering a lot of
diversity but winning factions of the crowd with their energy. He set the tone for an even-
ing of rock that Ronstadt beautifullydelivered. -

She sang with her considerable vocal powers at their peak and opened her set with the ti-

tle of her new album, Mad Love—loud, gutsy, stream-lined rock. Her tight, ‘l9-song set ._

covered her wide range of versatility but adhered strictly to the subject of love. Ronstadt
treated the hard-nosed tunes from her new album with an energy new to fans who had
previously seen her perform. She belted out “Cost of Love,” “Can’t Let Go,” and
“How Do I Make You” over her band’s extremely l_oud accompaniment. She dipped into
her country roots and offered sensitive renditions of “I Can’t Help It If I’m Still in Love
With You,” “Faithless Love,” and “Blue Bayou.” She dedicated “I’m Willin’ ” to all
Pittsburgh truck drivers and breathed throbbing life into older rockers “Just One Look”
and “Hurts So Bad.” .

Ronstadt still doesn’t indulge in much chitchat with the crowd; she relies on her voice
and song choice to communicate. Her final four songs had the crowd on their
feet-—“Poor, Poor Pitiful Me,” “You’re No Good,” “Living in the USA,” and “How
Do I Make You.” She followed suit with her ﬁrstencore, “Heatwave,” but closed the
evening on a softer note. The magic of Ronstadt’s lyrical interpretation brought the con-
cert to a delicate finish with her second encore, “Desperado_." The sweet desperation of
the song is a Ronstadt.trademark. The power and grit of her recent songs mark an exciting

turn in her;career. .

The Clash
Epic

By SCOTT MOWRY

Such raw energy, such primal passion,
such boundless sensitivity. So nice. '

The Clash. London Calling. Inspira- '

tional, fearless, sophisticated, Bohemian,
. bold, bawdy—brilliant.

The greats group in rock today. Joe
Strummer, Mick Jones, Paul Simonon and
Topper Headon. .

-This is the album that The Clash showed
only glimpses of previously. “Stay Free”
from Give ‘Em Enough Rope, “I Fought
The Law” from the American release of
their first album and the single “Groovy

‘_"'“”.Times” "suggested the potential, but it

seems doubtful that anyone, including The
Clash themselves, could have guessed they
‘ had a London Calling inthem.
With this double album set (selling for
A the price of one), all of punk rock’s critics
can eat crow. The Clash serve it up steamy
and meaty, and then cram it down their
throats.

- The rampant politics have not changed.
The intensive ideology has not changed. It’s
just that The Clash have mature, progress-
ed andhave become worldly and smart as

  . . hell.

The Clash never bought the watered-

 ".[.-_down aphorism—new wave. They were

punks, first and foremost. But surprisingly,
with London Calling, they have emerged
' with their least punky sounding record, yet

V  somehow their most Clash-like..

9 ' ‘ Maybe it’s because there are four sides of
-powerful music with “classic” scrawled all
over them. Maybe "it’s because The Clash
write, sing and play as if their lives were at
stake. Maybe it’s because The Clash
understand themselves, what it takes to sur-
vive and the importance of rock ’n’
' roll——past and present--as well as any musi-
cians today.

The Clash

Inspirational, fearless, sophisticated, Bohemian, bold, baudy. . .brilIiant.

V Or maybe it’s just because The Clash feel

. they are ready to lead us into the ’80s.

Producer Guy Stevens, a studio veteran
from the ’60s, has fused together the
perfect ingredients that personify the preci-
/sion, commitment and care of The Clash
philosophy. He has tightened up the band,
but still allows them the freedom to cut
loose. 1

Stevens expertly guides The Clash
through a veritable history of rock. From
Motown soul (“Train In Vain”) to all-out
rockers (“Hateful,” “Clampdown,”
“Death Or Glory”) to revitalized ska

. (“Wrong ’Em Boyo”) and to wall of sound

production even Phil Spector would be pro-
_ud to call his own (“The Card Cheat”).

Just A‘Sham’

HERSHAM BOYS
Sham 69
Polydorg,

Sham 69 used to be a basic punk
band. Their power lied in lead
screamer Jimmy Pursey’s political
lyrics, put. over a musical energy
rush. With Hersham Boys, their .
third LP, they've mutated to
Springsteenish conceptions. The
band is buried in the production
and Pursey is mixed out front. At ~
times Pursey even sounds like Ian
Hunter.

They were better at their most
basic. With this in mind, the best
cut on the album is “What Have
We Got,” recorded live. “What
Have We Got” recalls Sham 69’s
rebel-rousing past. Other than this,
Hersham Boys is a waste of time.

Benatar Stands
Out In ‘Heat’

IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT
Pat Benatar
Chrysalis

Pat Benatar has several things go-
ing for her.’ She owns a great voice;
has an FM hit, “Heartbreaker;” a
nicely packaged and well-produced
LP by Mike Chapman of Blondie
fame; a more than adequate backup
band; and Benator is a pleasure to
look at. But you wonder where her
head is at. Does she want to rock, -
be mellow, or be Blondie, Heart, or
even ‘Led ‘Zeppelin?’ _ . '

 

Drawing by Colleen Morrison »

“Heartbreaker” is a clever mix-
ture of Blondie and Heart, with a
little Robert Plant thrown in. The
album opens with “Heartbreaker”
and captures Benatar at her peak.
After this, the LP: slides between
I-love-you ballads and I-hate-you
rockers. This tends to get a bit
numbing; also a little confusing.
Lyrically, on the ballads, Benator
displays the expected perspective,
while on the rockers, she shows a"
cock—rock attitude that beats Rod
Stewart and the Knack at their own
game. And the songs aren't all that
strong, so the attention is focused
on Benatar.

’ .' Benatar can’t be held completely

‘ responsible, since she didn’t write

the songs. In the Heat of the Night
has its moments, like the already
mentioned “Heartbreaker” and “I
Need a Lover.” She needs stronger
material.

When you play darts, you can in-
crease your score by.looking at the
target before you throw.

  Bruford Storms 
,With Tornado

GRADUALLY GOING
TORNADO

Bill Bruford‘

Polydor

Who says drummers can’t make it
solo? Bill Bruford, formerly of
King Crimson, Yes, and UK, cer-
tainly has. His latest album,
Gradually Going Tornado, features
the assemblage of a tight band:
Dave Stewart, keyboards; Jeff ,
Berlin, bass; and “The Unknown
John Clark,” guitar.

As usual, Bruford never lets us

V down with the percussion work and,

what’s more, doesn’t dominate the
group. He also stays with the
routine drum-and-cymbal equip-
ment; nothing so much as a tam- _
bourine is used. The result of this
conservatism is obvious. It focuses
attention on his very talented band,
rather than himself. It also places
emphasis on the accomplished
songwriting.

The typical genre of music to be
found is jazz, perhaps fusion. The
sound is unique, mellow, distinctive
with soft electric guitar and driving
percussion. There are a few vocals
by Berlin, whose voice is dramatic,
yet unobtrusive. He is, however, a
touch off key at times.

“Age. of Information” starts off
the album. With its heavy
keyboard chords, dissonance, and
foreboding lyrics, it is an effective
song. “Joe Frazier,” a song in-
tricately integrated--withgquickly

movingv bass and piano work (often ’

in unison), is high-powered and one
of the most technically sound cuts,
on the LP. '

The melodies -in “The Sliding
Floor” and “Plans for J .D.” are
cute and well-crafted, blending into
the songs a refreshing element of
originality. The instrumental por-
tions, however, are not to be denied
their importance, for they, too, suc-
ceed very well.

The two long instrumentals, “The
Square Root of Q.E.D.” and
“Land’s End,” are extremely easy
to listen‘ to. Fast-paced and ex-
citing, they offer the listener solid ,
jazz. “Palewell Park,” which pro-

vides good contrast, is a very soft

song, composed chiefly of piano
and bass.

Don’t be misled by any
preconceived notions; Bill Bruford
is on his way up..

Kill to get it.
