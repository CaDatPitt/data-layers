UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

Professor accuses medical school of censorship

By Michele Quinn
The Pitt News

Editor's Note: This article is the
first in a series investigating vari-
ous aspects of the University of
Pittsburgh School of Medicine.

The tenure of a professor at the
University of Pittsburgh has been
.threatened after he accused the
School of Medicine of censoring
drug analysis information which
9 could affect mill-ions of children.
The allegation, made by Dr. Er-
dem I. Cantekin, a professor of
otolaryngology (ear, nose and
throat) at the university, involves
information about amoxicillin, a

commonly prescribed antibiotic
which is used in the treatment of
middle ear infections in children.
In 1980, Children's Hospital
and the University of Pittsburgh
obtained a $5.6 million grant
from the National Institutes of
Health to study middle ear dis-
eases, Cantekin said. The
research center performing this
study also received another grant
exceeding $5.9 million for addi-
tional research through 1990.
The analysis of the first study,
in which Cantekin was a co-
investigator, stated that amoxicil-
lin was effective in the treatment
of middle ear infections.
However, Cantekin questioned

the analysis prior to its publica-
tion because his interpretation of
the same data showed that chil-
dren who received amoxicillin
had more recurrences of in-
fections.

”Studies from Europe show
that children who are taking these
antibiotics may have com-
promised the immunity system in
their ears, and that as a result, the
disease becomes a recurrent or
chronic problem,” Cantekin said.
”This creates a bad situation for
the child which needs surgical in-
tervention in the end.”

In 1986, Cantekin, along with
Carnegie Mellon University

, Professor Timothey W. McGuire,

used the original data from the
first study, conducted another
analysis and authored a dissent-
ing paper in 1986.

This paper was submitted to
the New England journal of
Medicine for review and possible
publication.

”[The paper] was censored.
The university wrote a letter to
the New England journal [saying]
that I was unauthorized to use the
data and that my act was a grave
concern of academic miscon-
duct,” Cantekin said.

”This data is really obtained by
federal funds. It is the taxpayers
money. It should be public, but
the university and Children's

Hospital are saying that that is
their private property, which I as-
sume in the near future will turn
out to be totally false,” Cantekin
said. .

Cantekin claims that the
university does not want the dis-
senting paper to be published or
the data to become public be-
cause of a ”conflict of interest.”

Cantekin said that drug compa-
nies which produce amoxicillin
have provided large sums of
money for Pitt's department of
otolaryngology.

According to Cantekin, as a
result of his efforts to get the dis-
senting paper published, the

Posvar refuses comment
on possible tuition hike

By Jason Hillman
Staff Writer

University‘ of Pittsburgh stu-
dents will have to wait a little
longer to find out whether or not
they will be paying higher tuition

1 next year.

Both Gov. Robert Casey and
Pitt President Wesley Posvar
wanted to keep the cost of tuition
down for next year. Posvar re-
quested $133 million —— an in-
crease of 18 percent — to

maintain tuition at the present.

level. Casey proposed giving Pitt
$119.5 million and giving an ex-
tra $100 per student if tuition
hikes are limited to $100 or less.

The difference in the two

proposals is approximately $9
million to $10 million.

Posvar said the Casey proposal
fell short of what is needed to run
the university and still hold a tui-
tion increase to 2 percent and
give Pitt employees a 7.5 percent
pay hike.

Tuition increases have been a
problem for Pennsylvania state-
related schools. Tuition at Pitt has
risen $1,030 in the last five years,
an increase ofaround 28 percent.
Penn State's tuition has gone up
similarly.

”If national inflation is 5 per-
cent,” Posvar said, explaining the
reasons for the increases, ”then
inflation for a university is 7 to 8

Satellite dish will permit
Soviet broadcasts at Pitt

By Michael Seperack

Staff Writer

An 8-year-old idea of bringing
Soviet television to University of
Pittsburgh classrooms culminated
Friday with a reception to dedi-
cate Pitt’s new satellite dish.

The dish, located on top of
Forbes Quadrangle, will pick up
the signal of the Molniya Track-
ing system, which is broadcasted
to over 88 million Soviet homes.

From the dish, the signal can be
transmitted to classrooms via
Pitt's ”Campus of the Future"
fiber optic network.

Funding for the project came
from Pennsylvania's Ben Franklin
Fund for Equipment.

”The sophisticated tracking
equipment was actually more ex-
pensive than the dish itself," said
Oscar Swan, chairman of Pitt's
Slavic languages and literature

department. The tracking system

is used to keep the dish in line
with the Soviet satellite, and en-
sures that the system will still be
usable if the Soviet Union goes
ahead with plans to switch satel-
lites sometime next year.

Even with the system running,
there are still hurdles to over-
come, according to Swan. One of
these_ is a problem with class
scheduling. There are only a few
large lecture rooms equipped to
receive the signal, while most of
the classes that now incorporate
Russian television into their cur-
riculum are smaller, more ad-
vanced Russian language
courses.

Another problem is that there
is still no way for individual stu-
dents to view the broadcasts on
their own. Swan said that he
would like to set up a center for
viewing Russian television in the
Slavic Languages Library on the

IRA bombs British army barracks, injuring one

LONDON (AP) - The IRA
bombed a British army barracks
in western England early Mon-
day, but most of the men had
been evacuated before the blasts
and only one soldier was injured.

A half-hour before the three ex-
plosions, a sentry spotted two in-
truders and fired warning shots,
then woke the sleeping soldiers
and told them to get out.

Police set up roadblocks in the
area of the Ternhill barracks fol-
lowing the pre-dawn blasts and
said two suspects observed by the
sentry were thought to be at large
in a stolen car. They said they
were searching for a car taken by
a masked man from a nearby
home at about the time of the
bombing near Shrewsbury, 150
miles north of London.

The explosions shook nearby
houses, started fires, blew out the
wall of one accommodation
block and destroyed the roof of
another at the home of the 2nd
Battalion of the Parachute Regi-
ment, said Col. Peter Hicks, an
army spokesman.

It was the second IRA bombing
in six months at a British Army

{ .

 

  
  

barracks in Britain. In the last at-
tack in August, one soldier was
killed and nine others were in-
jured at the Inglis barracks in
north London. Security was tight-
ened at bases around the country.

One of the 50 soldiers sleeping
in the barracks at the time of
Monday's attack was injured
slightly by flying glass. Most were
away on weekend leave. ’

The battalion, part of the regi-
ment whose colone|—in—chief is
Prince Charles, is to begin a tour
of duty this week in Northern
Ireland, the domestic press agen-
cy Press Association said.

The outlawed Irish Republican
Army, in a statement issued to
Dublin news media, claimed
responsibility for the bombing
and said other attacks would fol-
low unless the British left the
province.

China bans imports
of liquor, cigarettes

BEIJING (AP) — China is ban-
ning cigarette and liquor imports
this year to save foreign curren-
cy and end abuses in its foreign
trade system, official reports said
Monday.

China Daily quoted Foreign
Economic Relations and Trade
Minister Zheng Tuobin as also
announcing a ban on reselling
export licenses and tightening

‘controls on imports of all

products that can be made in
China.

Zheng said the ban on foreign
cigarettes and liquors will apply
to all imports except those for
special tourist businesses, the
newspaper said in its overseas
edition. It did not say when the
restrictions take effect.

Last year, the government pro-

hibited sales of all foreign
cigarettes except those marketed
by the state's China National

Tobacco Corp. However, the

move did little to slow
widespread smuggling of foreign
cigarettes into China.

AIDS companion program begins

By Lisa Goetz
Staff Writer

In Pittsburgh, AIDS victims
who need companionship or
help with their daily chores
have a place to go.

The Pittsburgh AIDS Task
Force has designed The Three
Rivers Personal Active Listen-
ing project, a program that
pairs a volunteer with AIDS
victims who need a buddy.

Volunteers must pass a
screening session and applica-
tion process, according to
Patrick Randall, director of
client services and case
management programs at
PATF. ,

”This eliminates people
with other agendas, like reli-
gious people who want to
save souls or people who ar-
en't mature enough to handle
the responsibility,” Randall

the personality traits of in-
travenous drug users, how to
cope with death and dying
and other information relevant
to AIDS victims.

At the training sessions, ex-
perienced buddies share their
stories with the new volun-
teers, according to Randall.

”Volunteers come from all
walks of life,” Randall said.

Volunteers are heterosexual

or homosexual men and wom-
en ranging in age from 20 to
70, Randall explained.
0 Of the nearly 70 clients cur-
rently in the program, 37 have
buddies and 27 are managed
by PATF, Randall said.

Buddies and clients are
matched by their personalities
and by geographic location. A
buddy is required to have ac-
cess to a car.

A buddy must spend about
six to eight hours a week with

doctor's office, cook a meal,
run the vacuum cleaner, go to

a movie, or just talk. Some-
times they become good
friends," Randall said.

Volunteers in the P.A.L. pro-
gram belong to support groups
with other buddies, according
to Randall. The support groups
are led by team leaders and
two pyschologist facilitators.

Buddies are required to
keep a log of their experiences
and must participate in relat-
ed ongoing educational
programs.

”I am energized by the love
that the volunteers put out. I
don't know what people [with
AIDS] in the area would do
without this ' program. Some
would be very lonely," Ran-
dall said.

The lives of 1 1 cancer patients

”There is less chance of cancer
developing in other organs if they
are removed,” Ruth said.

were saved through multiple-
organ transplants performed at
Presbyterian-University Hospital
since June, according to hospital
spokeswoman Susan Ruth.

The transplant team at Presby,
headed by Dr. Thomas Starzl, has
performed the transplants on 13
terminal cancer patients. Two

people did not survive, including
one person who died following
a second transplant, said Ruth.
The procedure involved the
removal of ”clusters” of organs,
which included the malignant or-
gans as well as other organs
where the cancer was likely to

spread.

In most of the patients, cancer-

ous tumors were in the liver or
pancreas, according to Ruth.

Healthy donor organs, specifi-

cally the liver, pancreas and parts
of the small instestine, were then
transplanted into the patients,
Ruth said.

”The stomach was not re-

placed because it is not essential
to the digestion process,” Ruth
said.

Without a stomach, which acts

as a storage receptacle for un-
digested food during the early
stages of normal digestion, pa--
tients must eat several small

Brennan urges safety awareness

By Lou Grieco
Senior Staff Writer

Director of Public Safety Wil-
liam Brennan continued his ef-
forts to build ”community
relations” in a meeting held in
the William Pitt Union on Thurs-
day night.-

’’It is critical that you know us,”
Brennan told the audience.
”When you wear a uniform, you
represent authority. When there
is a problem, you can turn to us.”

Brennan asked the audience to
be his ”base of support” in fight-
ing crime in the university area.
He said it would take time t-o
generate his programs, and he
needed support from the
students.

’’I want you to help me recog-
nize the people who work for
me, because they also work for
you. They risk their lives for
you,” Brennan said.

He added that it was crucial to
start work immediately on his
plans, because the Pittsburgh
Police department has received
information that Jamaican drug
traffickers are planning to set up

operations ”in this very area.”
Brennan declined to give any-
more details.

He also said that charges that
the Campus Police department is
not a "real police department”
were untrue.

”This is a highly educated or-
ganization. Sixty—five percent of
our officers have college educa-
tions. In the’Philadelphia City
Police, 7 percent of the officers
have college degrees. There is no
comparison. A lot of you people
don't recognize what you have.”

Brennan said he plans to pro-
vide forms to be used for the
anonymous reporting of suspi-

cious behavior. The forms will be-

dropped into boxes around cam-
pus. Brennan said that they will
compare that information to
crime statistics in the area in an
effort to react to crime before it
happens

He also said that he hoped to
have a director's advisory board,
made up of students and adminis-
tration, and a ”contact team” of
officers who will talk to students
to discover their safety concerns.

Brennan said that he has seen

an increase in the reporting of
petty theft since he started as
director. He claimed that people
already feel more comfortable
about reporting crimes to the
Campus Police.

The meeting was sponsored by
the Graduate and Professional
Student Association, and featured
a question-and-answer session
with Brennan and some of his
officers.

Conflict arose at the meeting

when a student claimed that a’

friend had to call the Campus
Police twice to get help for an in-
jured man. She said that the
officer on the phone told her
”We never answer on the first
ring.” Brennan told her not to be-
lieve the ”rumors” that she heard
on the street.

Brennan said that he would be
willing to meet with the student
involved anytime. ’’If something
happens, she shouldn't go to you
[Chafetz], she should come to
me,” he said.

Students who are planning
to rent an apartment are "not
in an equal bargaining posi-
tion” with the landlord from
whom they wish to rent, ac-
cording to Shelia Ford, the
University of Pittsburgh's stu-
dent legal consultant.

Ford advised students at a
special apartment workshop
Thursday to inspect the apart-
ment and terms of the lease
carefully before signing any
papers.

Students don't have the op-
tion of changing anything in
their lease contract which they
might find unattractive. One
must either take the apartment
as is under the terms of the
Contract set down by the land-
lord, or, Ford said, look for
another place to live.

Ford told students they
should consider a variety of
neighborhoods before they
make a choice. Most students
opt to live in Oakland, but she
said Oakland may not have
the best properties for the ex-
orbitant amounts landlords
charge for rent.

Students warned of 69
off—campus housing

' will allow you to sublease the

them a lot of paperwork.”

’’I haven't seen the apart-
ments in Oakland,” she said,
but the complaints she has
heard from students have been
”unbelievable.

Perhaps the biggest problem
has to do with the unpredictable
nature of Soviet television sched-

Soviet Union, where listings are
published in the daily papers.

Because of the difficulty in get-
ting a hold of Soviet newspapers,
there is no way to determine
when specific programs will be
aired, according to Swan, who
added that this is especially frus-
trating when trying to videotape
a particular show.

Despite these problems, the

The emphasis is on discussion

’’it’s an invaluable tool for

Ron Linden, director of Pitt's

pean Studies. ”Pitt students will

”The patients have been
cancer—free since their trans-
plants, although it is too early to
tell if this will be true for years
and years. Only God knows how
long [Starzl] has extended their
lives,” Ruth said.

At this time, none of the 11
cancer patients who have sur-
vived the multiple-organ trans-
plants has experienced organ
rejection problems, according to
Ruth.

The most recent multiple-organ
transplant on a cancer patient,
which was performed on Feb. 6,
was successful, Ruth said.

Cancer patients are evaluated
on an individual basis to deter-
mine whether they are eligible for
transplantation, Ruth said.

Presby is the only hospital in
the country performing multiple-
organ transplants on cancer pa-
tients, according to Ruth.

"Patients have come from Wis-
consin, Alabama, New York,
New Jersey. The closest [was]
from McKeesport,” Ruth said.

Diana Hancock, 40, of Burling-
ton, Wis., underwent a multiple-
organ transplant on Jan. 13, about
five months after doctors discov-
ered she had cancer of her bile

duct, which is outside the liver.

Doctors transplanted Han-
cock’s liver, pancreas and part of
her small intestine, and rebuilt
her bile duct. Removed from
Hancock's body were the
stomach, spleen, gallbladder, ap-
pendix, part of the colon and part
of the large intestine, according
to Hancock.

no pain from the surgery itself. I

feel is from the incision; or if 1 eat
too much, I get a pain in my

Hancock became ill in Septem-

ber while visiting her sister in ’

Florida. Doctors at two hospitals
in Gainesville discovered cancer
and contacted Presby. On Oct.
25, 1988, she came to Presby for
a three-day evaluation and then
returned to Wisconsin. On Jan.
12, she received a call from the
hospital telling her to come to
Pittsburgh. Hours later, the sur-
gery was performed, according to
Hancock.

”At first, [I felt] hesitation
[about undergoing the multiple-
organ transplant]. 1 had doubts,
but 1 also wanted to live. Life be-
gins at 40, not ends. The future
for me was death. This gives me
a chance at life,’’ Hancock said.

Continued from page 1
chairman of the department of
otolaryngology, Dr. Eugene My-
ers, removed him approximately
2‘/2 years ago from the position
as director of research of the
center —- a position he had held
for 10 years.

Myers could not be reached for
comment.

”There is such a thing as aca-
demic freedom, and I'm a profes-
sor. I’m allowed to express my
opinion, and if there is something
scientifically wrong with my
opinion, it was never pointed out
to me,” Cantekin said.

’’I was relieved of my duties

and I was moved from my office,
which I occupied for ID years, to
this totally remote corner of the
hospital,” Cantekin said. ”There
is no one from the department
here. I’m not allowed to do any
research and I’m not allowed to
have access to data which I
worked with as a co—investi—
gator.”

Last March, a university panel
including.John D. Fernstrom, psy-
chiatry, Patricia A. Hoffee,
microbiology, and Charles Wat-
son, unanimously concluded that
Cantekin was guilty in several in-
stances, relating to his 1986
paper, in which ”academic in-

tegrity had been
breached.”

These charges stated that Can-
tekin did not inform other mem-
bers in his department that he
was submitting his paper on the
ineffectiveness of amoxicillin for
publication. Cantekin was also
charged with not telling the pub-
lications that his paper was a dis-
senting view.

Cantekin said he has written
evidence showing that he did in-
form his colleagues and the pub-
lications of_ the dissenting paper.

”The charges they brought
against me were trumped up. I
have shown the written evidence

seriously

to the University Senate Tenure
and Academic Committee, and
they have written a letter and
condemned the action of the
medical school behavior in this
matter,” Cantekin said.

Because Cantekin is a tenured
professor, the medical school
cannot dismiss him. A second
hearing which will decide
whether his tenure should be
taken away is scheduled for Feb.
24. If Cantekin is found guilty of
academic misconduct at this
hearing, his case will then go to
Pitt's T’lower campus” for a final
investigation.

Meanwhile, Cantekin said he is

excommunicated from his
department, not allowed to
research or teach and unable to
publish his paper.

”No medical journal will pub-
lish a paper in which the author
is under investigation,” Cantekin
said.

’’In my department, nobody
stands by me,” Cantekin said.

Dean George Bernier refused

to comment.

' Cantekin also said that the 9

university is doing everything it
can to ”get rid of him.”

”My assumption is that the
[university's] intent was I would
go away,” Cantekin said.

ZBT’s move to end
pledging laudable

After much debate and deliberation, there has fi-
nally been a major step by a national fraternity to end
the problem of hazing once and for all. The decision
is to end pledging,'and it was made by the Supreme
Council of the Zeta Beta Tau fraternity. Starting in the
fall, ZBT will be eliminating pledging in its chapters
nationwide. . E

The move is long overdue. Hazing —— the abuse, .
mental or physical, of pledges by brothers in a frater-
nity during the initiation period — has been a major-
concern on campuses around the nation, as reports
of extreme brutality have circulated. Lawsuits have
resulted from some incidents. On a more serious
note, 45 people have been killed in incidents of haz-
ing over the last 10 years, according to Jeffrey Siskin,
ZBT president at George Washington University, as
reported in the national college newspaper, U.

While the pledge period, a time of initiation when
the potential member of the fraternity is evaluated
for suitability, has been a long—standing (although not
seminal) tradition for the fraternity system, ZBT has
recognized that there is too much potential for abuse
within the concept. There aredifficulties in the elimi-
nation of pledging, such as the task of selecting can-
didates for the brotherhood during the relatively short
rush period. It becomes more problematic for the
groups to keep unmotivated people, troublemakers
and those who would not fit with the fraternity’s im-
age out. The third concern is somewhat distasteful,
and not something to be addressed here. However,
Pitt's ZBT chapter has come up with a possible solu-
tion to the first two quandaries.

It is planning to establish a standards board, which
will review the ZBT members monthly, to ensure that
brothers will be morally and academically acceptable.

This will additionally help to motivate the brothers
to take a more active roIe"in the organization, but
the primary gain here must be the reduction and pos-
sible elimination of the hazing problem. ZBT has
taken a bold step to resolve an important problem, 
and this fraternity should be applauded.

The big Soviet secret is out. The
press has revealed that Mikhail
Gorbachev makes $30,000 a
year — not a princely sum by
Donald Trump standards, but cer-
tainly in the same ballpark as a
U.S. congres_sman.

Many people are wondering
how Mikhail and Raisa live on his
pay. One person who has the an-
swer is Lem Newsom, a State
Department expert on Soviet sa-
Iaries. '

ART

”The‘ reason the Gorbachevs
can get by on $30,000 a year is
that they don't spend anything.
And they don't spend anything
because there is nothing to buy
in Moscow.”

”lt’s hard to believe,” I said.

”Let’s say that Raisa wants cod-
fish for dinner, which is selling for
20 rubles a kilo. She goes to the
store at 8 in the morning and
stands in line with the other shop-

. pers. At 6 that evening, the fish
merchant yells, ‘No more cod-
fish’ and slams the door. Raisa
goes home and tells Mikhail she
just saved another 20 rubles from
the household budget.”

Lem continued, ”The beauty of
the Soviet economy. is that every-
thing you could possibly spend
money on doesn't exist. There-
fore, at the end of the year, most

the Gorbachevs need shoes, the
head of the shoe cooperative in
Murmansk will provide them.
And ifthey need mulch, it will be
delivered gratis within the hour
by _the Mulch Commissar of
Smolensk himself.”

”But what about Raisa’s
clothes?” I asked.

”Whi|e there have been groups
critical of Raisa for borrowing ex-
pensive clothes from Soviet cou-
turiers, her defenders insist that
she has started a demand for Rus-
sian creations that no other Com-
munist first lady ever did before.
Even Mrs. Khrushchev didn't do
as much for fashion as Mrs. Gor-
bachev has.”

”What with all of the perks and
the borrowing, it's hard to believe
that any chief of a superpower
could not make ends meet on
$30,000,” I added.

Lem said, ”I haven't told you
the big surprise yet. The one thing
that keeps the Gorbachevs alive
and well is their American Ex-
press card. How they got the card
is a story in itself.” .

”They agreed to pose for an
ad?” I suggested.

”No. The CIA went to Ameri-
can Express and said itwanted
the company to issue a card to
the supreme leader of the Soviet
Union. American Express replied
that it had had very bad luck with
Soviet credit. Brezhnev stuck
them for three airline tickets to

Newsome continued, "The

told American Express that the U

put the CIA’s name into the com-
puter, and it turned out that its

credit wasn't any better than the .,

Kremlin's.

’’Only after intervention from

Pitt wins fourth

in a row, beats
Villanova 73-72

By Matt Martin
Sports Editor

It was a night of retirements at
the Fitzgerald Field House.

The Pitt athletic administration
retired former Pitt All-American
Billy Knight's No. 34 jersey,
sophomore guard Jason Mat-
thews retired to the lockerroom
less than halfway through the
game and the Panthers retired the
Villanova Wildcats 73-72 before
a sellout crowd of 6,798.

The Panthers improved to
15-10 overall and 8-6 in the Big
East with the win. Villanova
crumpled to 15-12, 6-7 despite
Doug West's team-high 24
points.

’’I thought it was a terrific
game,” said ’Nova Coach Rollie
Massimino. ”Everybody made
big shots at big times.”

But none were bigger than Pan-
ther reserve guard Pat
Cavanaugh’s one-and-one con-
versions with :34 seconds re-
maining in the game and Pitt
leading 71-69.

Cavanaugh, who played only
one minute, calmly canned both
shots to boost Pitt's lead to 73-69.

West then hit a three—pointer
with one second left, but the Pan-
thers were able to inbound the
ball on the ensuing possession
and run the clock out.

It was to Villanova’s credit that
they were even as close as one
point. The Panthers led 35-33 at
halftime and went on an 18-4 run
in the first five minutes of the se-
cond half to take a seemingly in-
surmountable 53—37 lead.

But playing without the high-
scoring Matthews, who twisted
his knee in a scramble for a loose
ball midway through the first half,
the Panthers found themselves
with no offensive firepower on
their thin bench and saw Villano-
va battle back to take a 67-66
lead on the strength of West's 17
points with only 3:16 to play.

So instead of offense, the Pan-
thers settled for the defense of
reserve forward Gilbert Johnson.

Johnson, 6—toot—8, kept his
hands in the face of 7-2 Wildcats
center Tom Greis, allowing him
only two points in the second
half, and those coming from the
foul line.

Johnson also grabbed three
defensive rebounds in the second
half and scored four points play-
ing in place of center Bobby Mar-
tin, who fouled out 6:30
remaining in the game.

’’I thought this was a terrific
win for the kids,” said Pitt Coach
Paul Evans. ”When you lose Ja-
son that early in the game and
you lose Bobby on fouls — we
haven't showed we have much of
a bench, and I don't know what
we caused the kids to do mental-
ly, but they did hang in there and
I thought they hung in there well,
especially after blowing a lead.’’

”They’ve got good athletes;
they've got good people,” Mas-
simino sid of Pitt's bench.

The Panthers not only lost Mar-
tin, but, despite Greis’ off-night,
had to overcome an uncustomary
lack of production from his posi-
tion -— zero points and three re-
bounds —— to win.

’’I think they [Martin and Greis]
made a deal before the game,”
Evans said. ” ’ I won't score if you
won't score.’ They both played
awful.”

But, as he has done so often
this season, sophomore forward
Brian Shorter carried the load for
Pitt. He scored 30 points and
grabbed 10 rebounds to pace the
Panthers in both categories.

Shorter is averaging 20.3 points
per game and 9.8 rebounds per
game through 25 contests.

”[He’s] the key to every game,”
said Pitt point guard Sean Miller,
who had 12 points and six assists.
”No one can stop him.”

Added Massimino, ”He does a
terrific job posting up.”

But the Wildcats attempted to
keep Shorter out of the post by
pressing and trapping the Pitt

Bobby Martin takes a spill during the first half of Pitt's 73-72 victory over Villanova last night.

Wrestlers manhandle Scots

By Don Boyd

Staff Writer

Last Thursday evening, the
15th ranked Pitt wrestling squad
hosted 16th ranked Edinboro and
came away with a 23-12 victory.

In addition to watching a match
between two of the nation's finest
teams, wrestling fans eagerly
awaited Santoro versus O’Day.

The Panther's Pat Santoro,
defending 142 pound NCAA
champion would take on Sean
O’Day, his opponent in last
year's collegiate finals.

In last year's match, Santoro
captured the decision 16-11.

In Thursday's match Santoro
scored on a takedown and a near
fall to take a 4-0 lead before
O’Day managed an escape to
close the gap to 4-1 at the close
of the first period.

Once the second period began,
it became apparent that the mo-
dus operandi for the match was
defense. Neither athlete wanted
to make the big mistake that
would allow his opponent to
emerge the victor. ‘

O’Day’s escape accounted for

all the scoring in the period.

Going into the third period
with a 4-2 lead ‘Santoro was de-
termined not to let the match get
away from him. Wrestling a tech-
nically sound period, Santoro
held O’Day scoreless while scor-
ing a’ point on an escape to cap-
ture the win 5-2.

Following the victory, Santoro
commented on the match and his
vanquished foe: ”I was a little
hesitant out there. I didn't open
up enough and it hurt me."

”Sean is always going to wres-
tle you for the entire match. He
knew I was going to shoot and he
defensed me. I didn't open up
enough and it hurt me. He's a
great athlete.”

Pitt coach Rande Stottlemyre
though pleased with the win did
not feel like Santoro wrestled his
normal type of match.

”Pat wrestled pretty conserva-
tively, not vintage Pat. He wres-
tled well enough to win. Being
afraid of making mistakes isinot
Pat, usually he just goes for it,”
said Stottlemyre.

As far as O’Day was con-
cerned, the effort was there, if not
the desired results.

”I knew what I had to do. ljust
had to go out, wrestle my hardest
and go after Pat. It might be the
last time I wrestle Pat, I may drop
down to 134 pounds,” said the
disappointed O’Day.

With the win Santoro upped
his record for the season to 39-2
while O’Day dropped to 23-5.

While the 142 pound match
was the headliner, there was no
shortage of excitement in the
other matches.

In the opening match of the
evening, Edinboro’s 118 pound
Lewis Rossell i gave his team a 3-0

lead when he decisioned the Pan- T‘

ther’s Bob Simpson 13-8. _

Next came the 126 pound
match where Pitt's Matt Rizzo
scored a 13-3 major decision
over Robbie Porter to pull the
Panther's ahead 4-3.

Edinboro’s Jon Venesile defeat-
ed Pitt's Joe Bursick at 134 by a
9-4 count to put Edinboro on top
6-4.

Santoro then beat O’Day to
give Pitt a 7-6 advantage.

Scott Hovan gave the Panthers
an emotional boost beating Ter-
ry Kennedy 9-4 at 150.

ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. — The
dilapidated gym stands in the un-
derbelly of this town, light years
removed from glitzy boardwalk
casinos that endlessly blink neon
and gobble loose change from
the senior citizens who are bused
here each day.

That's all right with Iran Bark-
ley, the WBC middleweight
champion, who works out there.
Glitz has never been his thing,
anyway. It was in short supply on
the hard streets of the South
Bronx, where he grew up.

Barkley, who defends his title
Friday against Roberto Duran,
has finished his day's work. Now

he sits on a side horse watching

an anonymous heavyweight and
a shorter man, both rough around
the edges, pound on each other.

”It’s a tough way to make a liv-
ing,” he said. ”People I worked
with showed me things. They
didn't just beat on me. What
good is that? Just beating on the
man?”

He swings to the other side of
the horse. ”This is the toughest
time for a fighter, the time in the
gym. The road work, every day,
over and over. If you're tired, you
still got to get. up and run. If
you're sore, you still got to box.
You can't think about the pain.
You just got to do it.

”When I run, I'm into my own
world, on my own private road.
My road is lonely. And it's Iong.”

That road started on those hard
streets, a rough place with gangs,
drugs and all the baggage of the

inner city. ”I don't like to
reminisce on it,” Barkley said. ”It
was rougher than this. It was
survival.”

But he remembered those roots
when he dropped Thomas
Hearns to the deck last June 6
and watched the title pass into his
hands. ’’In those 10 seconds, I
thought about it all,” he said.

Barkley always wanted better
for himself and his family. Some
of his friends didn't make it. They
are in jail, or they are dead. And
he is the middleweight champi-
on of the world.

The old neighborhood was no
help in the quest, though. Most-
ly, Barkley was scorned there,
ridiculed as a dreamer.

’’If you want to better yourself,
you get criticized,” he said. ”Peo-
ple would say, ‘He ain't gonna be
nothin’.’ The more I pushed, the

more they doubted me. They
want you at their level. They'll do
whatever they can to keep you
down. Misery loves company.

’’People would laugh at some-
body who couldn't read. That's
not funny. It's just that they don't
know. They didn't learn. I was al-
ways so afraid when I saw that.
I didn't want people to know I
couldn't read as well as I wanted
to, either.”

It's not that Barkley can't read.
It's just that he wants to read bet-
ter. ”I feel a need to learn, to
freshen up,” he said. ”I was out
of touch so long.”

The man who helped him
change that was his new
manager, oil and gas executive
John Reetz, who arranged twice-
a-week tutoring sessions for the
fighter. ”It’s very hard," Barkley
says, ”but I do it because I want

lessons

to improve myself.”

When Barkley was shopping
for a manager, he met Reetz in a
conference room full of lawyers,
debating contract terms. ”John
looked at me and I looked at
him,” Barkley said. ”We went
outside and I said, ’You want a
fighter and I want a manager.’ ”

 

The deal was done, and for all _

they know, those lawyers are still
at the table, talking.

Reetz and Barkley are from dis-
tinctly different sides of the street,

a button-down manager and his I
’ street-smart fighter.

”He showed me his world and
I showed him mine,” Barkley
said. Each of them turned some

heads in. the other’s neighbor-’

hood — Reetz’s suburban Bronx-
ville, N.Y., with its manicured
lawns, and Barkley’s South Bronx
with its projects and tenements.

Four games.

is that all it took?

Four games and the Pitt Pan-
thers have been able to turn a
season of despair into a season, of
extended hope.

Four games ago Pitt was 11-10
and 4-6 in the Big East. It looked
like it was going to be a long
season.

Now, after defeating Villanova
73-72 last night, Pitt is 15-10 and
8-6, good enough for fourth place
in the conference. The Panthers

are beginning to look like the
team to beat.

If they can beat Connecticut
and advance in the Big East Tour-
nament, anything can happen.

It all started against Geor-
getown at the Civic Arena. Pitt
came in as decided underdogs
and left with a 79-74 victory.
Then came St. John's and an
87-77 victory. Next was Seton
Hall (82-76) and then the
Wildcats.

’’I think we thought that this
was the way we were going to be
able to do it all year,” guard Sean
Miller said. ”Because we are so

young [Pitt starts five sopho-
mores] we knew that we would
only get better as the season went
along. We just have to execute at

the end of the game and we have

been doing that.”

Execution at the end of the
game used to be a sore spot for
the 1988-89 Panthers. Against
Siena (an 80-79 loss) early in the
year, Pitt couldn't bring the ball
in successfully and gave up an
easy basket at the buzzer. In their
first game against Villanova
(79-78), the Panthers couldn't hit
key free-th rows down the stretch

THE PlTT NEWS, Tuesday, February 21, T989

Shorter making mark as
one of finest rookies

ever in the

(AP) — Thanks to Brian
Shorter, who is having one of
the best rookie seasons in Big
East Conference history, upset
specialist Pitt's season likely
will be lasting a lot longer.

When the Panthers, 15-10,
surprised then-No. 12 Seton
Hall 82-76 last Saturday, it was
their fifth victory this season
over a nationally ranked oppo-
nent. Pitt earlier upset then-
No. 2 Syracuse, (No. 3) Okla-
homa, (No. 2) Georgetown
and (No. 9) Seton Hall.

”|'ve heard they're an up-
and-down team, but every
time I see them, they're up,”
Seton Hall coach P.J. Car|esi-
mo said. ”To me, they're
definitely an NCAA tourna-
ment team.”

One Panther who hasn't en-
dured alroller-coaster season is
Shorter, the 6-foot-6 sopho-
more forward who quickly has
made Panthers fans forget
about backboard-shattering
Jerome Lane's premature

Big East

departure to the NBA.
Shorter is averaging 20.3
points and 9.8 rebounds per
game — a better rookie season
than those of former Big East
stars Patrick Ewing and Chris
Mullin — and often has played
his best against the best teams.
His season-high 37 points
came in Pitt's 99-91 upset of
Oklahoma, now No. 1.
Shorter is the No. 2 scorer to
Wilt Chamberlain in Philadel-
phia high school history and
almost certainly would have
broken the record if he hadn't
played his senior season at
Oak Hill (Va.) Academy.
Shorter sat out last season
because of Proposition .48. But
Pitt coach Paul Evans said
Shorter refused to sit around
while sitting out, and instead
hit the weights — and the .
books
”Basketbal| means so much

more to him than it does to the

other so—called superstars,”
Evans said. ”lt’s what got him
out of Philadelphia."

Lacrosse team benefits from past Salaries

By Ed Kuznik

Staff Writer

Two years ago, the Pitt Panther
lacrosse team was in shambles.

The squad had yet to win a
game in organized club compe-
tition, and the only person who
came close to organizing the
team suffered a tragic accident in
the first five minutes of the 1987
season.

But Michael Nueman and Or-
feu Buxton decided they had
seen enough.

"We saw how lax the program
was,” Neuman said. "We just
said that we had to get things
going."

"It was more cataclysmic than
that,” Buxton added. "A guy by
the name of Bob Mankowski had
the program really on the rise, but
he injured his vertebrae in the
first five minutes of the first game
of that season and is now a quad-
raplegic.”

Since that point, things have

been looking up for the program, .

thanks largely to the efforts of
Buxton and Neuman. They
receive substantial funds from the
Student Government Board and
have recruited dedicated and
more talented players, generating
enough interest to have a legiti-
mate shot at winning their club's
conference.

"A lot of us were freshmen and
sophomores when all of this start-
ed to happen,” Neuman said, "so
now we're more experienced
since the core of the program is
back.

There are 10 players on the
field per team at any one time in
lacrosse — a goalie, three
defensemen, three midfielders
and three attackers. The goal for
both teams is to put a hard, rub-
ber ball approximately twice the
size of a tennis ball into the op-
position’s net.

Pitt has several key returnees
from last year's sqaud, which
won more games than any other
team in Pitt club history.

better off our program will be. A
lot of people are just starting to

Although Pitt will only com-
pete on the club level for the next
year, the possibility exists that
some Division III schools could
be scheduled for next season so
that the squad can see how it
stacks up against stiff compe-
tition. J
But for now, the Pitt club may
just very well have to settle for a
winning season in its league.

What's happening in baseball
is a disgusting display of greed

in the league is now up to nearly
485,000 dollars a season. And
the sham known as arbitration
isn't helping matters much.

In the outfield, the New York

second-highest paid player in all
of baseball this season, earning
$2.55 million dollars.

Yet Van Slyke claims being the
second-highest paid player in the
league isn't significant to him,
even though he is and that's what
really matters.

"That's never been important
to me. It means absolutely noth-
ing anyway because next year 30
players will be making more than
me." '

Translation: We're probably

gonna have to renegotiate this

contract somewhere down the
road, because‘ I'm not getting
paid what I'm worth.-

Pitchers? Well, Doc Gooden of
the Mets thought he had the up-
per hand when he inked an un-
precedented three-year pact
worth $6.7 million. Not to be
outdone, Roger Clemens then
stuck his right arm into the pic-
ture and milked the Red Sox for
$7.5 million over three years.

Then [just recently, an all-

american boy and Cy Young~

award winner named Orel Her-
shiser pulled a fast one on both
Clemens and Gooden by
holding-out for and receiving and
unbelievable three-year deal
worth $7.9 million. ~

Greed. I

And who's to blame? Big city
organizations like the New York
Yankees and Mets, the LA Dodg-
ers, the California Angels + the
Donald Trumps of MLB. They've
got the cash and the crowds, and
so they'll spend whatever it takes
to assemble a pennant winner.

Lefty Dave LaPoint did an ex-
cellent job for the Pirates after be-
ing acquired in a mid-season
trade with the Chicago White
Sox. Trouble was, he became a
free agent at season's end, and
the Pirates couldn't afford to pay
him what he wanted.

The Yankees‘ needed a left-
hander. Steinbrenner could afford-
to pay LaPoint what he wanted.
LaPoint now wears blue pin-
stripes. -.

What baseball needs to do is
implement an adustable salary-
cap structure, similar to the one
the National Basketball Associa-
tion uses in determining its play-
ers’ salaries. Hey Steinbrenner,
you want to steal Hershiser from
the Dodgers by offering him a
three-year deal worth $20 million
? Fine. That gives you 1 1,000 be-
ans left over to sign the rest of
your team. Good luck!

in turn, think Don Mattingly
will settle for a $1,250 a season
just so he can play with Hersheis-
er and possibly win the pennant?
It will never happen.

But Steinbrenner offering some
guy $20 mil over three years?
Now that's a different story.

Jon Anderson/The Pitt Ne

Pitt's Pat Santoro grapples with Edinboro’s Sean O’Day in a rematch of last year's 142-pound NCAA final, which Santoro won. Santoro also took this match.

Scots

Continued from page 8

Pitt's Doug Johnson was defeat-
ed by Robert Taylor in the 158
pound match by a 5-1 count as
Edinboro narrowed ‘Pitt's lead to
10-9.

half and 14 overall.

If the Pitt-Villanova series has
been defined by its rugged play
over the past four seasons, then
last night was a textbook game.
Villanova was assessed 29 per-
sonal fouls and saw forwards
Marc Dowdell and Rodney Tay-
lor foul out with 23 points be-
tween them.

The Panthers racked up 20 per-
sonal fouls and lost Martin and
Matthews. ' »

Actually, Pitt was lucky to-get
any production from Martin/at all:
Only 1:12 into the game/Martin
went up for an alley-oop attempt
from Miller and wound up on his
back under the basket. C

Martin left the game after an in- '

.jury time-out and with the score

tied at two.

Rod Brookin, who scored 18
points in the game, replaced Mar-
tin at that point, but it was Mat-
thews whq made up for Martin's
absence with three pointers on
consecutive possessions to give
Pitt an 8-6 lead with 16:50 re-
maining in the first half.

Those would be Matthews only
points.

West scored seven first half
points and Gary Massey, Kenny
Wilson and Taylor added six
points apiece as the Wildcats fell
behind by two at the half, 35-33.

Brookin opened the second
half with a three pointer, Shorter
added a layup and Brookin hit
another three to give Pitt a 10‘
point lead before Massey broke
Nova’s cold spell with‘ a layup.

Miller then scored five con-
secutive points and Shorter had
12 of his 14second half points to
pace the Panthers to the victory.

NOTES: —Matthews severely
twisted his‘-imee and his return is
unknown-at’-this time.

”He won’t be back this Satur-
day," said -E-vans, noting Pitt's fi-
nal home game of the season
against Connecticut.

”|t’s too early to say [when he
will be back],” Evans said.

Damico 9-6, giving the visitors a
12-10 lead.

At 177, Pitt's Lance Markel
gave ' a gutty performance in
defeating Frank Zelinsky 9-7.
Despite two injury timeouts, Mar-
kel’s scrappy performance gave
the Panther’s a 13-12 advantage.

Pitt's Perry Miller dominated
Kurt York at 190, winning 15-2
and putting the Panther’s ahead
17-12.

In the heavyweight match,
Pitt's John Owens scored a fall
over Martin Buzas which
clinched the win for the Panthers.
