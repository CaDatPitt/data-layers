Most Pitt fans didn’t expect it, be- H

cause Levance Fields’ foot  has
kept him far from 100 percent for the last

11 months But when Fields made his 
appearance in the starting lineup Friday, V

night, he showed that the   a
thing of the past

Fields’ 15 points and eight assists,’ 

along with Dejuan Blair’s doubledouble,
helped Pitt jump to an early lead and
cruise past  Dickinson 86-63
at home on Friday night in its season
opener. '

“I’ve never seen a team play man-to-
man defense the way Pittsburgh plays
it,” said  Dickinson coach Tom
Green. “[Pitt’s] defense is the best d_e-
fense I’ve ever coached against”

That defense started early

A11 ﬁve Pitt starters registered at least

one steal, with Tyrell Biggs, Sam Young

and Blair  two each

And aside from  plays‘ on de-
fense, Blair made his presence felt with
the ball, too A

The sophomore center started the
scoring for Pitt with a fast-break dunk
and scored eight of the team’s ﬁrst 12
points, helping to build a 16-2 lead.

He ﬁnished the night with 17 points
on 8-of-13 shooting He also added 13
rebounds — seven on the offensive end
-— and an assist.

Fields, a senior guard who wasn’t ex-
pected to play, said hewas impressed with
what Blair did on both_ sides of the ball.

“He dominated again,” said Fields

Forward Sam Young, a ﬁrst-team all-
Big East selection last season and an All-
America candidate, added 15.

Junior college transfer Jermaine
Dixon eamed the start at guard opposite
of  scoring six points- on 3-of-6
shooting while adding four assists in his

Pitt debut. Three other Pitt players also

played for the ﬁrst time in Pitt colors,

each  15 or more minutes
Freshman guard Ashton Gibbs

The Daily Student Newspaper of the University of Pittsburgh

assists Forward Nasir Robinson tallied

four and pulled in four rebounds

Bike Czarvisits to

by Angela Reno
Staﬂ Writer

Aside from the mayor and city
council president, the City of Pitts-
burgh also has a czar.

Stephen Patchan’s formal title
is the bicycle-pedestrian coordina-
tor for the City of Pittsburgh’s City
Planning Department, but he’s better
known as the “bike czar.”

Patchan came to campus on Fri-
day to discuss the issues that cyclists

face during a special campus sustain-

ability meeting.

Those at the meeting said the
largest demographic within the cy-
cling community are people in their
20s to mid-30s, a good portion of
whom are students

Patchan is working with Bike-

talk sustainability

Pittsburgh to get the word out to
current and potential cyclists about
improvements and initiatives within
the city to aid cyclists with commutes
and bike safety.

Since he took office in August,
Patchan worked to get some of the
city’s  bike lanes repainted.

He is also working on an incen-
tive proposal for business Down-

town, which will encourage the area
to become cycling-ﬁiendly by of-
feting employees  like secure
parking for bikes and showers in the
work place

Many people at the meeting
raised concerns that there aren’t

a enough bike routes within the city.

This is one of Patchan’s biggest con-

cerns and undertakings _

The event was to celebrate Di-
wali, or the “Festival of Lights,” 21
major holiday throughout South
Asia celebrated in Buddhism,
Hinduism, Jainism and Sikhism.

‘ A variety of performers —— in-
cluding instrumentalists, dancers
and singers —- took the stage in
celebration.

“You’re up there dancing, and
you don’t know what else is going
on,” said Pitt freshman Anand
Mahalingam.

Mahalingam’s performance
group was comprised of friends
re-enacting a scene from the Hin-
di movie “Lagaan.”

Audience member Rose McA-
loon, a Pitt sophomore, said she
thought the Diwali show ap-
pealed to people of all ethnic and
cultural backgrounds.

“It’s got so much energy, and
[the performers] are so into it,”
she said.

When Carnegie _Mellon’s
“Chak De,” a coed dance team,
took the stage, parts of its routine
included excerpts from American

Proposed

system to
have cages

Sustainability, page 1

“I’d like to see all the parks con-
nected . . . more bicycles on the street
and less conﬂict between cyclists
and motorists. Additional bike lanes
would be a part of that, too,” said
Patchan. .

One of the ideas brought to the
table was to have more bike racks
and cages to safely park bikes Down-
town.

Patchan described a cage system
that would be free to riders who ap-

V plied to get a card for access. Upon

swiping the card, individuals who
held a card could have access to se-
cure their bikes safely.

This system will help authorities
to cut down on bicycle theft, as they
will know who had access, to the 
because the card swipe registers the
swipefs information in a log every
time he uses it ‘

Another idea that Patchan is cur-
rently working on is combining local
authority resources to keep track of
stolen and found bikes

Currently the city, the surround-
ing communities and local universi-
ties have their own  and lost-
and-found systems

Patchan wants to combine the
information and efforts of these dif-
ferent departments to help cyclists
reportlost bikes and ﬁnd them more
efficiently then reporting and check-
ing each different department

Finally, Patchan announced that
he is currently working with a local
television station, which he is not yet
at liberty to name, on a series of pub-
lic relations projects

The project is meant to inform
citizens about cycling in Pittsburgh,
why they should start cycling and
what the rules of the road are for
cyclists and motorists alike when it
comes to responding to bikes on the
road.

This series of informative seg-
ments will run from April through
August 2009.

' SGB slates should be

professional, not petty

Student Government Board
is undoubtedly an important or-
ganization on campus. The stu-
dents involved in SGB control
the allocation of hundreds of
thousands of dollars for groups
and organizations on campus,
determining what those groups
of students can do.

‘And Pitt students will elect
next year's board this Thurs-
day.

But when SGB candidates
and board members embroil
themselves in disputes ‘over
election rules in an effort to
gain an edge in the elections, it
doesn’t reﬂect well on them as
student leaders. It makes them
look petty and incapable of de-
termining what’s important.

Some slates are preoccupied
with trying to catch each other
breaking rules about endorse-
ments and slate relations. There
were allegations ﬁled against
three of the six slates last week
for breaking sections of the
election code.

Current board member La-

leader, Endia Vereen, neither of
whom are running in the elec-

tion, ﬁled an allegation against _

the One Vision One Voice slate
for receiving an illegal endorse-
ment from an SGB committee.

Additionally, the Revolution
slate accused One Vision One
Voice of being related through
l_inks on Facebook to One Pas-
sion One Pride, while another
accusation ﬁled by Revolu-
tion accused the Students First
slate of accepting an illegal en-
dorsement from a non—student
group.

It’s true that oversight is im-
portant, if for no other reason
than to ensure that slates have
a level playing ﬁeld and_ aren’t
bending the system to their
advantage. But every one of
these allegations has been insig-
niﬁcant, to the point where few

would even-notice unless they  I
V 1

were looking for it. .
The_ elections board eithe
dismissed or proved all of these

4

allegations not guilty. But that .

doesn’t change the fact that the
controversies distracted people
from actual campaign issues.

It would be different if one
of the slates had actually com-
mitted a serious offense. If
the most pressing issue in the
election is whether two slates
violated the rules by being acci-
dentally related on their respec-
tive Facebook pages, then the
state of student affairs is pretty
grim .

What the slates need to real-
ize is that_they’re trying to be-
come the formal representatives
of the student body, and thus
they should comport them-
selves like professionals. Thou-
sands of Pitt students look to
SGB to make decisions regard-
ing the student body and alloca-
tions. SGB positions aren’t just
an opportunity to play govern-
ment —— they’re serious jobs.

But if the slates can only
bicker about who might have
violated a rule with an insigniﬁ-
cant or accidental action, that

certainly doesn’t paint a picture’

of students stepping up to lead
the school population.
And because it’s inevitable

that members from different

slates will work together af-

ter the _election,‘the candidates '

shouldn’t start their working re-
lationships by making enemies
with each other.

Scrutinizing the actions of
SGB members and slates is
necessary, given the importance
of the duties attached to the
positions. But there’s a differ-
ence between close scrutiny
and just being petty. The candi-
dates should look out for their
own best interests, but they
shouldn’t try to sink each other
with spurious allegations.

T.I. is the Obama of hip-hop

by  Lehe
Colummltt

   
 
 

If you haven’t seen it, I urge
you not to miss the cultural event
of the season. The music Video for
“Whatever You Like” is available
for viewing on a Web site called
YouTube. I

The
video is awesome for a number of
reasons. First and foremost, T.I.
buys a diamond necklace by pour-
ing out a briefcase full of $100 bills
right in the department store.

The girl in the video — who I’ll .

call ATL Shawty — is not unbe-
lievably hot. Don’t get me wrong.
If I saw her at a party, I’_d-say,
“That is a very good-looking girl.”
But I wouldn’t wonder, “What is
that girl doing at this party that I
am at?” like I would with Rihanna,
as featured in T.I.’s “Live Your
Life” video. ATL Shawty is very

” curvy, more so than the typical eye

candy you see in a rap musicivideo.
Those girls are chosen for male au-
diences to enjoy. ATL Shawty was
chosen for the ladies.

The “Whatever You Like” vid-
eo is the ultimate Cinderella story.
ATL Shawty starts, out working
a lousy job. Though she doesn’t
have an awful stepmother who
makes her do chores, ‘she does

“Whatever You Like”

have a lame boyfriend who makes

her braid his dreads.‘ There is even I

a, scene where T.I., a.k.a KING,

has her ﬁtted for shoes.

But what good is a Cinder-

'ella whose glass slipper only ﬁts

bombshells? ATL Shawty is de-
sirable but not unattainable. Most
girls watching probably have at
least one girlfriend, with whom
they sympathize and relate every
day, who is as'hot as ATL Shawty.
Every time i the “Whatever You
Like” video plays on TV, millions

‘of girls are transported to right‘

there ir1 the private jet, right there
by the pool, right there eating ﬁne
fusion cuisine on an immaculate
white tablecloth.

There is no sex in the “What-
ever You Like” video. She might
provoke, but ATL Shawty main-

-tains a wholesome distance the

whole time; In the scene where T.I.
and ATL Shawty ﬂirt by the swirn—
ming pool, she is weating a mod-

est, white, one-piece swimsuit, one I

of the only one-pieces in all of rap
video history.

Rather than using her for sex,
in the “Whatever You Like” vid-
eo T.I. sets himself ‘up as a be-
nevolent, deistic provider-ﬁgure.
“You’re too pretty to be working
here,” he tells ATL Shawty in the
ﬁrst scene, and heiliterally means

just that: T.I.’s interest seems to ,

be in providing ATL Shawty with
what she" deserves, more than get-
 out of her.

All this awesomeness ‘relates
to T1. capitalizing on what I’ll call

. “Obama eool,” which I predict will

be a new trend in our pop culture.
Gangstetism and doing horrible
things to people are lame now. It’s
all about being triumphant, keep-
ing a positive attitude and exhibit-
ing a spirit of reﬁned professional-
ism. ' '

Consider these lines from T.I.’s
other hit, “Live Your Life”:

-“I’m the opposite ' of moder-
ate, immaculately polished with
the spirit of hustler and the swag-
ger of a college kid. Allergic to the
counterfeit, impartial to the poli-
tics. Articulate ...”

If you gave me these lines and
told me, “Guess whether these rap
lyrics are written in the voice of the
 who did Dope Boyz, or in the
voice of Barack Obama,” I would
deﬁnitely go with the latter. It’_s al-
most eerie once you think about it,
and if I told you right off that the
lyrics were about Barack Obama,
you’d ﬁnd it impossible to believe
it was actually about  else.

As an aside, if you pretend
that the part of “Whatever You
Like” ‘where T.I. says, “Need yo

I emerge from the Cathedral
at 12:51 a.m. into the sharp Pitts-
burgh chill, with ragged scraps‘
of void knowledge leaking from
my overloaded hippocampus
and falling softly ontothe cold
asphalt behind me. The pass-
ersby walked with a distinct aura

, of obliviousness. But it’s not the

distinct aura of Vobliviousness
typical of your average college’
campus, with the young woman
entertaining herself mid-com-
mute with a Sudoku puzzle, or
the young man narrowly evad-
ing the polite jab of a 71D as
he hits the SEND button on his
cell phone while wandering into:
a bus lane. .
No, this sweeping diversion

_ lies on a ‘different plateau.

A couple inexplicably freezes
rnid—stride to gaze upward. A girl
aiming a digital camera at the
heavens collides head—on with an
emergency police call box. I turn
around.

Lo! What beautiful, lumines-

cent glory! Spectacular blues,

yellows, pinks and violets, all‘

projected crisply onto the very
_towering obelisk‘ that just hosted
my six—hour study session! What
vibrant, chromatic splendor!

I survey the area. Faint bridg-
es of photons traverse over busy
avenues. They originate from
gargantuan projectors shrouded
in what appear to be even more
gargantuan black garbage bags.
Some of them are at street level,
but one sits majesticallyabove
all like a medieval king looking
down upon his court. I

“How on earth did theylget
that thing on the roof of the
Union?” I wonder.  tried to get

, to the roof of my apartment
building once. I had to blackmail
my landlord. ,

I “Did you happen to catch

the’ spectacle last night?” Iask a

classmate the next morning.
“What?” '
“Upon the Cathedral.”
“Oh, you mean the light pat-
' tern thingy. Yeah. Pretty sweet.”
The original pattern, designed
by French artist Lucette De Rugy

as a homage to the Gutenberg
printing press, has since been
replaced by an equally glorious
mathematics—themed design.
But gazing at its vivid, geometric
brilliance one evening, I couldn’t

help but wonder: How can we_

capitalize on-_ this revolution-
ary technology once ‘Pittsburgh
250’s Festival of Lights celebra-
tion comes to its heart—rending
end Nov. 20? It would grieve me
not to take in such sights again.
I had no idea that such a clear,
bright image could be transposed
through’, an outdoor environ-
‘ment so vividly. And now that I
know such a capability does ex-
ist, I have no qualms declaring
that the possibilities are indeed
endless. Four six—ton projectors
and a 42-story Gothic cathedral?
It’s child’s play. It would be like
giving a mountain of clay to lVIi—
chelangelo and saying, “Do your
thing, brother.”
So once the Festival of Lights
meets its dreaded terrninus,'why
.not hook up an old Super Nin-
tendo to the projector atop the
Union and play Cathedral Tetris?

High scores could be rewarded
in the form of Book Center Gift
Certiﬁcates.

Or, on Friday and Saturday
nights, I propose a literal rep-
resentation of classic" Pitt joke-
lore — a projected image of a
single magnetic compass. This
will make for some amusing ex-
changes:

“Where are we?” ‘

“Doesn’t matter. Drunk Com-
pass, remember?”

“There it is! Onward!”

“Hold up  Are you seeing
what I’m seeing?”

“What the hell was in that
jungle juice?”

This isn’t to say that the new
projections would just be fun and

‘games, though — such would be

a complete and utter waste of
resources, the likes of which I
would not stand’ for.

We know all too well that tu-
ition is on the high side. Why not
buy the projectors from the city
and rent them out to advertisers
for additional revenue? I’d gladly
trade that $160 Student Activity
Fee for the occasional Red Bull

 Cathedral projections havemore potential

Cathedral of , Learning, or better
yet, an Edgar Snyder & Associ-

ates Stephen Foster Memorial.

And if for some unforesee-
able reason advertisers decline
the University’s offers, the Ca-

thedral projectors are prime

real estate for Pittsburgh’s local

supervillains. Think about I it.
What medium trumps Cathedral"

projection when you’re demand-

ing a $40 billion ransom for the

release of Sidney Crosby?

and Celine Dion still releasing

535-foot tall tapestry of light to
show us, hey, it ain’t all that bad.

Well, it required that and a
whole lot of wattage, which re-
minds me: That $175 electric bill

In "Entropia Universe," players create their own online identities and participate in a real economy. Characters rlangefrom big-chested women to big-gunned guys and everything in between.

Online universe makes real World cash

by Alex Avakian
Staﬂ Wrzter

David “Deathiﬁef ’ Storey wakes
up and departs to his island every
morning.

He has to maintain the creatures
he’s raised and adjust their DNA if
necessary, keep the fertilizer station
running, maybe bid on a rare item or
two and keep his estate in top form
for the" thousands of visitors who
will be traveling through to hunt,
mine, party and much more

Storey, 26, is serious about his
job. A

Storey maintains Treasure Island,
a scenic, tropical paradise for which
he paid $26,500 in December of
2004. Not a bad price for a whole is-
land, right? The only  is, he will
never step foot on it That’s because
Treasure Island is a land mass that is
only found inside the virtual world
of Swedish software company Min-
dArk’s game "Entropia Universe."

In October of 2005,]on “NEV-
ERDIE” Jacobs paid $100,000 for
the purchase of an asteroid ‘space
resort inside "Entropia Universe."
Welcome to the most expensive vid-
eo game of all time.

These two entrepreneurs are
now both  in huge sums of
the in—game currency PEDs, or Proj-
ect Entropia Dollars, which can be
exchanged for real life US. dollars.

They are both  real life, six-
ﬁgure incomes now

"Entropia Universe" is a form of
the massive multiplayer online role
playing game. Games like “\X_/orld
of \Warcraft’’ and “Everquest” also
fall into this category. These games
link hundreds of thousands of play-
ers from around the world into one
enormous universe that is ﬁlled with

all sorts of monsters, weapons, ar- '

mors, items, quests, cities and a vari-
ety of different landscapes for play-
ers to explore. " 0

Individuals create a character or
“avatar” and set out into the world,
killing  and completing objec-
tives for experience points, which al-
low characters to  levels, become
more powerﬁil and improve their
skills. I

But don’t think that just anyone
can log into a Virtual world and make

. a real life fortune

“At the end of the day, 'EntIopia
Ur1iverse' for most people is just a
super fun game,” said John Bates, a
consultant for the game. ‘Take how
many people ride skateboards or
something. i ‘

There are not a lot of people who
are  their  skateboarding.
It’s a very small number, but they’re
having a blast And .then there’s a
group below them that are serni—pro
who are getting their stuff -for free

pretty much, and then there’s a group
below them, the big group, who are
paying for their skateboards and hav-
ing a really good time, just doing it
because it’s really fun.”,

There is no main objective in-
side the game, and that is one of the
things that has attracted approximate-

ly 700,000 people to make accounts. .

Instead, players can choose to play
the game any number of ways. ’
You can focus exclusively on

To do this,though, you first need ’

to know someone who will trust you
with his $20,000 '(yes, real dollars)
ship. All of these actions will also

help your character develop the 90-
plus skills that are available to him.
Nevertheless, "Entropia Uni-
verse" is a. &ee game It’s free to
download, and unlike many other
games of its type, there is no month-
ly subscription fee.‘ However, putting
in,$20 once a month makes a big dif-
ference. Using your credit card, you
can buy PEDs at an exchange rate of

10 PEDs equaling one dollar.

This allows you to buy weapons,
ammo, healing packs and any num-
ber of the thousands of items inside

the game. Buying these items will _
0 make it easier for you to accomplish

the tasks mentioned above Natu-

' rally, some are signiﬁcantly more ex-

pensive than others.

This is the limit of most virtual
world style games, but "Entropia"
goes much further. On the continent
of Amethera, there is a town called
New Oxford, which is considered
mbememmkwmhmmﬂofdw
game. ,

Designed in conjunction with
Professor Ernst Billgren of the Royal
Academy of Art in Stockholm, Swe-
den, the art galleries of New Oxford

' feature real artists’ works on display. 0

Currently, they are showcasing
the art of Mark Kostabi, Kika Kar-
adi and Marc DeMuro, all three of
whom are highly successful artists.

Using your avatar inside the

game, you can pay with PEDs for
real, one of a kind art pieces that will
ship directly to your home address in
the real world.

New Oxford also boasts a pleth-
ora of fashionable clothing that can
be bought in the same way. There are
also museums, a music school, banks
and much more.

As of right now, the planet of Ca-
lypso contains all of these things, and
Calypso is the only planet available to

Entropians so far But multiple comi I

panics, including the official Chi-
nese government, are making plans
to create their own unique planets,
which will be just as, if not bigger,
than Calypso.

\X/"1tl.'1 an in-game turnover rate
of more than $360 million, don’t
expect the economy or the world of
"Entropia Universe" to go anywhere

“What that says to me is that peo-
ple want to have that human connec-
tion to be a part of the game,” said

‘Bates. “It says that where the real

juice is now in gaming‘ is in virtual

towards  coming of age, and

Kaya’s drink menu is extensive, if not a bit,

"overpriced (some cocktails costing double dig-

its), and the spot earns extra points for a good
selection of micro—brews.

We started our meal with Yucatan bean dip
($7) and chips made in—house. The clip was
thick, with a ground beef consistency, and it
was a great complement to the lightly seasoned
and mostly crisp chips. Aside from the few sog-'
gy or overcooked chips in the bunch, the appe-
tizer could’ve been a solid meal on its own. .

Our entrees arrived after a short wait, but

my date and I had a hard time eating — both
dishes simply looked too good to disturb. My
adobo marinated ﬂank steak ($24) came with
braised ; collard greens, pan-seared portabel-
las and smashed potatoes, but the entire meal
looked like one uniﬁed dish,'not a steak with
a few sides. The thinly sliced meat rested atop
the potatoes and cascaded across the plate, the
mushrooms just barely peaked outbetween
the slices, and a small ball of tangy pepper
and onion relish crowned the whole

crust along the edge of each long, thin slice
kept each bite enjoyable. Still, it was the rest
of the dish that was supreme —— the potatoes
were thick and wildly creamy, altogether more
of a delicious paste than traditional mashed
potatoes. The greens were extremely rich and

soaked in a tangy gravy — I only wished there

was a bit less steak and a bit more of everything
else '

My date ordered tempura—battered chili rel-
leno, a vegetarian ‘dish that included hominy
and  mushroom stuffing cased in a light,

ﬂaky brearling. The crust was too greasy —
think flied carnival food — but the vegetable

We decided on the ice cream sampler for
dessert ($6.50) and chose watermelon sorbet,
caramel dulce and-chipotle ice creams That
last selection proved the best —— who knew ice
cream could be spicy? The small ball included
tiny shredded pepper pieces and tasted both

- start in the second half; scoring four

points in the first eight minutes, com-
pared to the Aggies’ 11 points In ad-
dition to the nonexistent offense, the
Panthers had 18 turnovers with 11:47
to gointhe game, endingwith22
turnovers overall.

Although Pitt struggled to ﬁnd
a rhythm, 'it took advantage of free-
throw opportunities to get within
three points of the Aggies, making
the score 40-37 with 7:47 

The Panthers failed to keep any
momentum, however, as the Aggies’
increased their lead to 52-44, with less
than two minutes remaining.

Redshirt freshman Tyra White

led the Aggies with 13 points, fol- ’

lowed by Sydney Colson with 12. Big

points and 13 rebounds for Texas
A&M.

In her first collegiate start, fresh-

man Shawnice “Pepper” Wﬂson ,

sult of both the Aggies’ defense and
the Panthers’ inability to produce an

Fields ready to play,

shows it 1n season opener

' by Pat Mitsch
Senior Staff Writer

It wasn’t publicly announced that

i Levance Fields would start Pitt’s opener

against  Dickinson on Friday
until announcer Bill  intro-
duced him in the starting lineup minutes
before tipoff .

But Fields knew long before tha
apparently-

Fields, who hadn’t played in either
of Plus two exhibition games this sea-

four weeks ago that he would start the

“I could have played in the exhibi-

tions, but there was no need to rush,”
said Fields “I justgotto 
shape Pm ﬁne” '

And so was his performance on Fri-
day. Fields scored 15 points in 25 min-
utes and shot 4—of-6 from the floor and
2—of—4 from 3-point range. He made all
ﬁveofhis ii:eethrowattempts,dist1ib-
uted a game-high eight assists and didn’t
tum the ball over once

“Being out for 11 months and not
beingabletodowhatlreallywanted,
it’s been a long time,” said Fields “The
more I played, the better I‘ feel. I don’t
have any soreness I can pretty much
playlike I did before Iwas hurt, so that’s
agood thing”

Fields was ﬁrst  when he frac-

Men's Basketball

Niiami (Ohio) looks to g
finish upset against Pitt

by Ravi Marfatia
Staﬂ Writer

Even while coming off a dominating win
on Friday night, the Pitt men’s basketball team
knows Miami (Ohio) might not be much of
a pushover.

In their second game of the season, the
Panthers (1 -0) will square off against the Red-
hawks (1-1) at 7 p.m. at the Petersen Events
Center. ‘

The Redhawks are coming off a close en-
counter with No. 4 UCLA - a game in which
they lost by only five points, 64-59. Miami
won its ﬁrst contest of the season against
Weber State on Wednesday 70-66.

Senior Michael Bramos, Miami’s top scor-
er from a year ago, returns to lead the Red-
hawks. Bramos ranks in the top 10 in blocked

shots, 3-pointers made and attempted, and
free-throw percentage in the school’s history.

Bramos also became the 33rd Miarni play-
er to reach 1,000 points when he notched 22
against UCLA.

Bramos was the only Redhawk to score in
double digits against the Bruins on Thursday.
Senior guard Kenny Hayes tallied 24 points in
Miami’s opening victory against Weber State
and was an honorable mention All-MAC se-
lection last season.

The Panthers will try to stuff Miami’s top
offensive threats like they did against Fair-
leigh Dickinson in their opener Friday night
The Knights’ top player, Sean Baptiste, was
held to only-nine points.

It marked Pitt’s 29th consecutive noncon-
ference home win, which is a_ school record.

Four players saw their first Division I
action in that game. ]unior—college transfer

‘Jermaine Dixon started at shooting guard.

Freshmen Travon Woodall, Ashton Gibbs
and Nasir Robinson all saw plenty of min-
utes as well.

Dixon scored six points and had four as-
sists, while Gibbs led the freshmen in scoring
with eight points on 3-of-7 shooting against
Fairleigh Dickinson.

Pitt will look to keep up its hot shooting

cent of their shots against the Knights and
assisted on 27 of the team’s 36 buckets.

The Redhawks have a 10-2 series advan-

time Pitt played Miarni was back in 1968.

Wrestling

by Adam Littman
Senior Staﬁ’ IV/‘iter

When the Pitt wrestling team
opened its dual meet season against
Lehigh, there was also faceoff be-
tween the last two Pitt wrestlers to
win national titles.

The meeting didn’t take place
on the mat, but instead on the

sidelines.
7 Keith Gavin, who won the
National Championship last year
in the 174—pound weight class for

  
 

high’s head coach is Pat Santoro,
 who may be the most decorated
wrestler in Pitt history.
 Santoro won back—to—back na-
I tional titles in the 1987-88 and
1988-89 seasons while wrestling
in the _142-pound division. He still
 holds the record for most career

history.

“He’s a great guy, [a] very good
coach and a great wrestler,” said
Gavin of Santoro. “I really like the
way he approaches wrestling. He’s
an intelligent guy. He’s not one of
those guys who takes the meathead
approach.”

After holding the same position
at Maryland for the last five years,
Santoro is in his first year at Lehigh,
where he was an assistant before
his time at Maryland. He was also a
four—time member of the U.S. Na-
tional team and an alternate for the
1996 Olympic squad.

“I think from a very young age
I knew I always wanted to stay in-
volved with wrestling, so [becom-
ing a coach] was a natural fit,” said
Santoro after his Lehigh Mountain
Hawks (2-0) defeated*Pitt 27-9.

And although Gavin took the

job as coach, he said he still plans
on competing and hopes to make
the U.S. National team, which holds
its qualiﬁers injune. And once he’s
done competing," he said he thinks

Prior national champions face off on bench

coaching is what he’ll do.
“I really enjoy coaching,” said
Gavin.

Although both were successful A

athletes at Pitt and Gavin is follow-
ing a similar career path as Santoro,
neither really could pinpoint any

other similarities between them.

Gavin said the biggest similarity he
could find was that neither won a
state championship in high school.

Santoro couldn’t come up with
any but had nothing but praise for
Gavin.

“He’s an unbelievable techni-
cian,” said Santoro. “He’s good
enough to be one of the best in the
world.” i

Pitt coach Rande Stottlemyer,
who coached both wrestlers, came
up with a few parallels between the
tWO.

“They both were very quiet, un-
assuming kind of guys,” said Sto~
ttlemyer. “They crafted their trade
very succinctly. They’re great stu-
dents of the game. When they won
they expected to win. You didn’t

‘Freshmen's early play

impresses Blair, coaches

Men's basketball, page I
And while all four are ﬁrst—year players
at Pitt, Blair said he’s not letting age or ex-
perience get in the way of his expectations
for what they can do.
, “I don’t think there are freshmen on the
team,” said Blair. “They’re‘ new guys.”

Fields logged 25 minutes and didn’t ‘

show any evidence of a sore foot. Pitt
coach Jamie Dixon said Fields’ solid play

surprised him, especially cons‘idering how
little he’s_been able to play leading up to
the season.

Either one of the two might have been .

able to help the Panthers in his first dual
meet of the season Saturday night.

Pitt started off strong with a win in the
125-pound match by freshman Chris Al-
bright. With about a minute left in the third
period, Albright allowed Lehigh’s John Mc-

Donald to escape his hold, giving McDon- .

ald one point and tying the match. But mere
seconds before the buzzer "sounded, Al-
bright recorded a_ takedown for-two points
and the 6-4 victory. '

No. 19 Matt Fisk of L_ehigh defeated No.
20 Jimmy Conroy in the 133-pound match
by recording a takedown with a little more
than 40 seconds to go in the ﬁnal period to
tie the match at three.

Another freshman, Tyler Nauman, gave
Pitt the lead in the 141-pound match with a
4-1 decision over Seth Ciasulli. '

of the two freshmen. -
