 

I    Dr. Steele Gow Explains Post

by DAMAINVE MARTIN

Dr. Steele Gow, assistant Provost of the University’s Division of
Instructional Experimentation and chairman of the new Undergrad-
uate Academic Council, says his posts will facilitate campus com-
munication.

The Division of Instructional Experimentation, he explains, will
provide a means to “experiment with instructional processes and cur-
riculum without threatening the ongoing stable processes of the Uni-
versity.

Under his administrative direction, the Division will concentrate
on testing innovations in education suggested by students and faculty
alike. The testing will be conducted through the Learning Research
and Development Center (LDRC), whose work is directed by Robert
Glaser.

“The LRDC," comments Dr. Gow, “has developed an expertise
on learning theory as based on the behavorial sciences. It seeks to de-
velop a science of learning as opposed to tradition and intuition.”

Ultimately, the‘ LRDC. which is part of ‘the Division of Instruc-
tional Experimentation, will provide a “bypass to the Provost’s office,”
says Dr. Gow. By testing and rendering operable innovations suggest-
ed by the students and faculty, its work will permit the administration
to adopt acceptable recommendations “without threatening the stabil-
ity of the University system.’.’

As Dr. Gow puts it, “The Division of Instructional Experimenta-
tion will provide a hospitable environment in which experiments hav-
ing to do with instruction and curriculum can be conducted and new
programs can be developed to the point of confidence in their work-
ability. They can then be integrated into the regular operation of the
University.”

Dr. Gow, who received his Doctor of Philosophy degree from the
University in 1951, was a faculty member from 1957 to 1965. He now
views his chairmanship of the Undergraduate Academic Council as a
link between the students and the administration. ~

Citing the student body as a “prime source of ideas and sheer
energy for keeping the University up to date and relevant in a rapidly
changing sociey,” Dr. Gow feels that the Council will provide a true
channel for communication. It will both give the administration ac-
cess to the student body as a source of ideas and demands for change,
and provide the administration and faculty with a new way to present
their views to the students.

Dr. Gow cautions, however, that “bringing students into participa-
tion in the decision-making process of the University is quite a differ-
ent thing from allowing students to run the University.”

His prime objective is ‘_‘not confrontation, only collaboration in get-
ting attention and quicker action on student recommendations before
they become demands.

Commuters Name
Chief Complaints

Over 50 commuters this week were asked
to express their biggest complaint about com-
muting and to propose possible solutions. Al
though the specific complaints included:

— Parking

— Busses .

— Alienation form dorm students

—Expenses

— Lack of information about activities

The general opinion voiced by every commuter
was, “I really feel out of it. Most of the time I
don’t even feel like I am a part of the University.”

“We have practically no part in the social life
here at the University,” said one commuter. “The
dances, which provide an opportunity to meet other
students, are few and far between. What’s really
bad, though, is that we don’t even eat with the
dorm students.”

Tom Taylor, a sophomore chem major, com-
plained that commuting is line going to high school
without meeting anyone. “Since bulletins are post-
ed mainly around dorm areas, the commuter does-
n’t often know about an activity until it’s over. For
example, today there was a movie for pre-med stu-
dents that I would like to have seen, but I didn’t
find out about it until it was too late.”

“Running back and forth to the parking meters
is what gets me,” said one commuter from Monroe-
ville.

David Lichius, a sophomore English major,

commented that “commuting is_ expensive.” “If »

there is something going on in the evening, you
either have to pay transportation costs twice in one
day or pay for dinner.”

One commuter from Alliquippa felt there was
no place for the commuter during the day. “I’d
rather go home because I don’t like to impose upon
the dorm students.” she said.

What did the commuters feel should be done to
remedy the situation‘?

Laura Clancy, a freshman from Liberty Bor-
ough, said, “There reallys isn’t that much you can
do, because every commuter has a different sched-
ule.”

Karen Srafin also felt that not much can be
done. “Bussing students from a single area direct-
ly to the University and dorm-like facilities for

East and West

Berlin: Tense Battlefield

Berlin, today, is a modern met-
ropolis purged of almost all signs
of World War II destruction. East
Berlin, once criticized for its ug-
liness has begun to catch up with
the Western section in the con-
struction of new and beautiful
buildings, parks, a n d highway
systems. Yet this shinning exam-
ple of German technology. back-
ed by eastern and western aid, is
the sight of the most bitter battle

between the two Cold War super-

powers. Here in the heart of Eur-
ope sit 11,000 Allied soldiers sur-
rounded on four sides by 450,000

Soviet and East German troops.‘

Here, only the American nuclear
threat stands between a free West
Berlin, and a Soviet-East German
invasion so swift that an official
of the West Berlin‘ government
gives his city only five minutes
in which to resist, before com-
plete capitulation.

Situated 110 miles‘ behind the

—‘‘‘Iron Curtain,” West Berlin is a

deep thorn in the hide of the So-
viet Eastern Europe. To under-
stand Soviet attitudes toward the
German capital, one need go to
the heart of the city. There at
Checkpoint Charlie, East and
West must stand on ladders to see
eachother over the wall. Non-Ger-

man travelers wishing to cross over

to East Berlin are required to wait
for at least one hour while their

money is counted and credentials
checked. Whilesitting in the East
Berlin customs office, one cannot
fail to see the wall photos of Wal-
ter Ulbricht and V. I. Lenin. Yet
underneath these pictures is a

caption written by Bertolt Brecht. 4

The caption reads, “Wer Berlin
hat, der hat Deutschland. Wer
Deutschland hat, der hat Europa.”
—.“He has Berlin, has German.
He has Germany has Europe.”
So that a1l'Westerriers may under-
stand Russian feeling toward Ber-
lin, this caption is written in red.
It stands out as a reminder of the
stakes in the battle for Berlin.

Yet wall posters and propagan-
da are not an East Berlin exclu-
sive. On the Western side of
Checkpoint Charlie is a small li-
brary dedicated to an anti - Ul-
bricht advertisement. The walls
of this converted storeroom-li-
brary are covered completely
with photos of the East German
worker's riots in 1953. These pho-
tos (some as large at 10’ x 10’) are
supplemented with captions con-
demning the East German police,
the oppressive regime of Ulbricht,
and the Soviet menace behind it
all. Anotherjexample of anti-com-
munist and anti-Soviet sentiment
is the 11 story" skyscraper of the
West German’ “publishing mag-
in a t e A x e l Springer. Springer,
boasting perhaps the most anti-
communist stand of the West .Ger-
man press (75 per cent of which
he controls, 95 per cent in West
Berlin), built this ostentatious
headquarters for hisifirm right
along the Berlin wall. On the top
of the building is constructed a
neon ticker-'-tape ‘a la Times
Square that continuously beams
western slanted news eastward.
In addition to this ticker, Spring-
er has forced East Berliners to go
bed each night to the flashing red
and white message: “Axel Spring-
er, Incorporated.”

The sign war, though, is rela-
tively mild comparedlto the war
of nerves in the city. To frustrate
and isolate West Berliners, the
Soviets and their East German al-
lies have made East Berlin “off . " '
limits” to them. Even the once
c h e r i s h e d “Christmas passes”
have been revoked, thus keeping
the -Berlin populationphysically
divided. '

Now, seeing the rubble of
World War II disappearing, and
a bright, new city taking its
place, the East Berliners have ac-
quired a strange pride. They
maintain that they rebuilt their
city without Soviet aid, unlike
their Western neighbors who re-
lied heavily on Western funds.
No longer do they labor and live
in the dark, prison - like atmos-
phere of 1953. They criticize the
patronizing attitude which the
West Berliners assumes towards
them, and they do not long for a
liberation from a Soviet dungeon.

As practical people the East
Germans are determined to make
the best of their portion of the
Fatherland. And they deeply re-
sent being referred to as living in
“The Zone” by the West Ger-
mans. This new pride has been
welcome music to the ears of U1-
bricht and his ‘Soviet allies, who
see it as further assurance of a di-
vided Berlin, and a divided Ger-
many. For if the Soviets cannot
have all of Germany, and there-
fore all of Europe, they certain-
ly do not want the German to
control it. Behind the words of
Brecht the Russian can still re-
member the sight of Nazi soldiers

Perpetual Myths

n" This year started with a roar. Students at the University
were not only confident about attaining more representation

 ._ and_ influence in University decision-making, but were en-

thusiastic about the future success of our football team. That
once enthusiastic roar has now subsided into the pessimistic
- purr of the kitten.

-Our football team now has an 0-2 record, and the quest
_ for more student involvement is stymied by our stubborn self-
defeating whims. This brings the student body to acritical
middle ground. Will we, as in years past, prostrate ourselves
to the burdens of the Trimester and remain complacent? Will
we continue to support our football team? Or, will we ride on
the crest of the wave of student involvement?

The Pitt News has urged time and time again that the
only sure course to change is one that encourages coopera-
tion and understanding. And this, to be sure, is a difficult
course to follow. a

The road to understanding becomes even more difficult

 /when students, faculty members, and administrators main-

tain beliefs that are somewhat distorted.

One huge myth hovering over this University commun-
ity concerns the students’ perceptions of the administration.
Most students maintain that the administration actively
' works against studentcauses. They are members of the “es-
tablishment” and therefore can’t really perceive unique stu-
dent problems. This myth is perpetuated by those who casti-
gate their contemporaries for “sticking up for the adminis-
tration.” But all myths arise from specious generalizations.

, All members of the administration are not “John Birch-
ers” ;. all members of the administration are not arch-conser-
vatives; all members of the administration are not against
change. In fact, many members of the administration are

I * more dedicated to changethan the faculty.

A One case that certainly destroys the myth of administra-
tive inertia is the dedication recently voiced by Assistant
Provost Dr. Steele Gow, Jr. He believes that his role should
provide a bridge between the students and the administra-
tion. ‘_ ‘The student body today is a prime source of energy to-
ward. making education more relevant to the needs of the

 ‘times. Rather that viewing it as a threat, it is to the Universi-

ty’s advantage to tap this energy source,” according to Dr.’
Gow. Is this the statement of an administrator who is op-
posed to change and who fears student involvement?

It wasn’t by chance that McGeorge Bundy said the force
for change in the University community lies not in the ad-
, ministration, but in the faculty. Bundy argues that the real
power of any University community lies with the active"-
' minds of the faculty. .

The implicit lesson here is that the University adminis-
tration should not be the whipping boy for student frustra-
tions. Student frustrations should be heard, but they should
‘be directed in the right directions. The administration cer-
tainly isn’t God’s gift to the movement of educational reform,
but they don’t qualify as right wing Facists.

‘. . .’Oh Hum . . .’ Classes Drag,

by RUTH ZAPLIN

It is almost a universal phenomenon among col-
lege students to approach the first classes of each tri-

. mester with high aspirations. No matter what year

a student is in, although the symptom is probably

exciting; it’s a challenge.

UNFORTUNATELY, the unveil
ing inevitably ensues. It. seems 
as if the long vacation has had its 
effect on the brain, complete
clouding a stark reality. The,pro-
fessor ascends to his podium and
begins ranting through the intro-
ductory lecture, as the once-
separated fragments of memory
slowly, piece themselves together
and come into focus.

As the professor drones on the burning light of
truth shines beighter. As the ' student ‘proceeds
through his series of “first” classes, he faces the
.shock of absolute truth!

We are not here to learn. We are not here to con-
quer the-world, assert our views, and seriously ex-
press ourselves in class. There is no time for that.
Most professors too conscienciously suck up each
droplet of time, using it to persecute the faceless
mob — the student body —— the University’s-blood.

HOW MANY times has the same Porfessor X
reported those same fact-laden mundane sentences
in that same monotone? Surely there must be an
easier way for some humans to make a living. Per-
-haps these same humans could, try their hand at

Students Sleep . . . For What? .
l.____

 

waiting on tables or selling swimming pools — any
kind of job that would finalize in one way or anoth-
er the students supposition that the humdrum person
in front of them, is, in fact, a live.

How long must this set of circumstances exist?
Are the number of professors that are eager to keep
alive the rare sparks of genius in some students di-
minishing? '

Happily there are some professors at the Univer-
sity who do take the time, even precious class time,
to acknowledge worthy students. Unfortunately,
however, and estimating from the casual remarks
made by students as they shuffle wearily from class
to class. it seems as if professors who really care

about their students, more are in the growing minori- ,

ty.

IT IS HARD to speculate where most of the blame
should fall. Should it fall on the professor who seems
to be prostituting his knowledge while lulling his
students to sleep. Or should the blame fall on the stu-
dent who is willing to accept and become a product
of the awful fate — seemingly endless hours of tak-
ing notes solely for the purpose of regurgitating them
in exchange for good grade?

What do all those grades amount to ? That de-
gree; that wonderful degree is the thinking person’s
license to freedom; the ticket that permits one to
enter into an institution of even higher learning, or
into the practical world. _

It would seem to be another universal phen-
omenon that sooner one graduates from college,
the sooner one can start really learning!

  

ways forshadows the decay of a community.

Over The Edge

Now Is The Time To Pray
For Edward Litchfield’s Baby

by DAVID RQSENBLUM

The student power movement
at the University died before it
began, an aborted stillbirth.
The movement never had a chance
simply because it was taking place
at Pitt. What the student power
advocates forgot was, that if you
want a student movement to suc-
ceed, you must have the support of
the students behind you; this is
impossible at this institution. The
reason is not apathy. No. the reason
is that the majority of the students
are perfectly satisfied with the
present situation. But even worse.
the so-called student power ad-
vocates are not willing to put
themselves on the line for their
cause. They are. in reality, as
conservative as the rest of the stu-
dents; but at least they fur-v
nished the answer to that age old
question, “why does hot air blow
around the Cathedral.”

The fact is, this university is
run, by a conservative adminis-
tration, who in turn hands down
their dictates to an even-more
conservative student body. One
of the chief organs of the stu-
dent body that listens to these
orders is the ever—efficient Men’s
Dormitory Council. Their meet-
ing last week was a perfect ex-
ample of the exquisite reaction-
ary intellect that permeates every
corner of Pitt. The purpose of this
meeting was to vote on the “new”
social rules ‘and, that sham of
shams, the judicial review board.

The social rules debate was in-

- teresting to hear because the sena-

tors demonstrated very aptly that
their reason and logic rank very
high on the manifest—stupidity
scale. When it came time to dis-
cuss rule three which states the
sexual intercourse will not be per-
mitted in the dormitories. I nai-
vely sat back to listen to a hot dis-
cussion; what I heard bordered
‘on the unbelievable. One sena-
tor said that the rule should exist
so that the University will be pro-

tected, and another senator said-T;

the rule should exist so that the
other rules would receive the ap-
proval of the administration.
That was it. Nothing else. There
was not one dissenter among those
virile young men. The rule went
right through. Do the senators
think that if a girl gets pregnant,
the administration will accept
the blame. Do they feel that the
place of conception really matters.
Don’t they know that the only peo-
ple.to be punished will be the boy
and girl? And they must know
that one of the punishing parties
will be the puritanical adminis-
tration. But they have the guts
to say that they want to protect
the administration, and they want
people to believe them. But have
no fear dear reader, there is no
use in telling the MDC this.
They’re perfectly happy to in-
fringe upon this human desire.
They want to stay in the good
graces of the rulers.  ‘

When it came tifiito debate
the judicial reviewwboard, the
MDC decided that sitting for
an hour and a half was more
than enough, so they adjourned
their meeting, a meeting that they
called with the main purpose be-
ing to discuss the review board.
Maybe they had pressing engage-
ments elsewhere, like a wrinkled
shirt or tie. Maybe they know that
their decisions aren’t really de-
cisions, but administrative tri-
bute. They probably don’t have

any time limit. upon paying this
tribute. After all, at Pitt, there’s
never any rush to do anything.

I’d like to say that the reason I
was at the meeting was because I
was going to speak to them about
student rights; but they did not al-
low me to speak. And this was af-
ter they said that I could. Were
they afraid to hear someone who
is not an administration lackey?
The president came over to me
and said, “I’m sorry, what could
I do?” I didn’t answer him; after
all, he’s only the president.

But I’m thankful for the coun-
cil made me finally realize that
the-' students at" Pitt enjoy their
little serfdom. They’ll get upset
if the football team loses and de-
mand the firing of the basket-
ball coach. Sometimes, on cer-
tain warm night when the air con-
ditioners are working, they'll stand
in the quad'waiting to be pelted

‘ by bras and panties. But that’s

about the extent of their protests.

Dr. Rubenstein told me that
he thinks the administration at
this school is more intelligent
than the one at Columbia. I can’t
agree with that. The administra-
‘tion at Pitt is just a helluva lot
more secure. When a school be-
comes state related and wipes out
any chance of a liberal univer-
sity, it’s just got to bring a tear
to many a reactionary administra-
tors eye.

But what about you poor liber-
als. the ones who can't stomach the
university policies. The only
thing I can say is do whatever will
make you happy. If you want to

. fight, fight. I myself am going to

enjoy my life as far removed from
our campus as possible. And man,
amll happy I’m a senior, becuase I
hate to see sad things: and some-

, how, there is nothing sadder than

watching a forty two story build-
ing sink into the depths of con-
servatism, never to rise again.

Y)ur personal acceptance of
Senator Clark suggests a practi-
cal position for those of us who
are opposed to the war. A con-

his public life to the goals of just-

havior abroad.

He has been an outspoken critic
of the War in Vietnam and an elo-

Sen. Clark—-Consistant Champ

quent voice for peace.

Senator Clark is a man of great

insight and intelligence. Matur-
ed by the wisdom of age. he re-
tains the idealism of youth. He
is a man who deserves the support
of those who believe in change
rather than stagnation. and Hope
that Pitt's students will rally be-
hind his cause.

Sincerely.

Dr. Steele Gow: The Man . . .
Who Can Help ‘Communication’

by DAMAINE MARTIN

This column could begin with-

a list of Dr. Steele Gow’s titles.
It could say that he is the Univer-
sity‘s first assistant provost for
the Department of Instructional
Experimentation: that he holds
the post of Executive Director
of the University‘s Learning
Research. and Development Cen-
ter: and that he chairs Chancellor
Posvar's newly instituted Under-
graduate Academic Council.

It could even say something
about his professional back-

-ground . his many academic de-

grees. and his professional car-
eer as an educator and research
administrator.

But this column doesn‘t.

If it did. it would relegate
to the ranks of the ordinary man
whose position in the University
may prove of Extradinorary im-
portance to students. faculty. and
administration alike.

THE SOURCE of this potential
importance stems from Dr. Gow’s
perception of the institutions which
he heads: A perception which
directs these institutions toward
facilitating improved student-
faculty - administration communi-
cation.

As chief administrator for the
Division of Instructional Experi-
mentation. Dr. Gow plans to use
the center to test and make operable
educational innovations suggest-
ed by the faculty and students.

It is here that ideas and recom-
mendations will be examined.
utilizing the experimentation
done in the behavorial sciences
by the Learning Research and
Development Center.

AS DR. GOW comments. "The
Division of Instructional Experi-
mentation will provide a hospi-
table environment in which ex-
periments in instruction and cur-
riculum can be conducted and
new programs can be developed
to. the point of confidence in
their workability. They can then
be integrated into the regular op-

.~ eration of the University."

Dr. Gow feels that in this way
one of the major problems of the
University can be 'solved-re-
maining stable and yet" responsive
to change at the same time. The

mentation will essentially serve
"to develop the innovations and
ideas of students and faculty to
the point where they will be opera-
ble without being destructive."

It will provide a true channel
of communication to the admin-
istration.

Dr. Gow sees a second major
channel of communication in the
new Undergraduate Academic
Council. Although he will chair
the Council. Gow perceives his
role to be that of “a neutral. pre-
siding officer who will provide
a bridge between the adminis-
tration and students.“ He main-
tains. moreover. that the Academic
Council will allow the student
body “to respond to and par-
ticipate in the University system
in a meaningful way.

In Dr. Gow's words. “The stu-
dent body today is a prime source
of energy toward making education
more relevant to the needs of the
times. Rather than viewing it as
a threat. it is to the University's-

advantage to tap this energy.

sourcef‘

HE ADDED THAT “The Chan-
cellor and the Provostset up the
Academic Council because they

_ , _ _ . .felt that there had been inade-
Division of Instructional Exper1- 

quate response to student feeling.
The Council is intended to pro-
vide a wider channel of com-
munication."

Dr. Gow thus occupies a unique
position in the University. He
stands midway between the ideas
and demands of the students and
faculty on one hand and the

traditions and power of the ad-

ministration on the other.

Dr. Gow could ignore the stu-
dents and play up to the‘adminis-
trative establishment. He could‘
lose his enthusiasm; and only fun-
ction to perpetuate the existent
status quo of virtuallyino com-
munication between the ‘student
body and the administration.

DR. GROW, however. perceives
his job as “not confrontation.
only collaboration. in getting at-
tention to the quicker action on
student recommendations before
they become demands.”

With this goal in mind. Dr.
Gow could improve and enrich
student-faculty-administration in-
teraction on this campus. and the
chances are that he will.

Editor. The Pitt News:

This letter was sent to the
Chancellor‘s office.
please print it. ‘

Dear Sir: '

I have just received my aca-.

demic invoice for"the coming
term (Fall '68-'69). and I was
amazed to find a fifty
dollar increase in tuition. Being
an “Out-of-state" student living
in Pittsburgh.

I had heard of the increase but
the only reason stated for such an
increase was the failure of the
Pennsylvania State ' Legislature
to allocate as much money as was
originally agreed upon.

I am trying to figure out why’

this increase should be given even
to “out—of-state“ students who:

‘Not Mature’

Editor.The Pitt News:

We have all been taught a
sign of a mature adult _is one who
will admit his miﬁakes gracious-
ly..I fail to see a mature at-
titude on the part of Mr. Rosen-
blum in response to criticism on

his recent article. “Jewish Power."

His Answer . . . . “that he can take
no responsiblity for the ignorance
of his readers" is not only in-

fantile in its defense. but it is to- .

tally meaningless.

I have spoken to many stu-
dents in regard to his article.
and they all disliked and were of-

fended by it. Can they all be

wrong‘? I think it would do him
credit if he would either graci-
ously apologize and admit his
mistake. or intelligently defend
his article. )

’ As things stand now. I feel that
he only has covered "his original
mistake with a larger and more

petty one. Thank you for taking’

the time and reading this.

Clarifies SDS
‘Quotations’

- Editor, The Pitt News:

The Pitt News story on the SDS 3’
(Sept. 20) carried a misquotatio’ ‘
of something I had said at thefi
SDS meeting. While I am par
tially to blame for having made _a

 

self to misunderstanding and mis.
quotation I feel it necessary to
-clarify the point made. -

I In conjunction with the SDS 2
work this summer I had stated’ —',
that we had left the Farm Workers‘ S‘
Union for political reasons. I was’_
then quoted as saying": “The poli-
tical reasons being that Humphrey
and Barr also backed them.’.’
What I had said was, “The poli-

tical reasons being indicated
‘by the fact that Humphrey and
Barr backed them.” ._ I.

The‘ political reasons, as ex-
pressed by consensus of an SDS
Meeting in August were: unneces-
sarylimitation of the tactics of
the Farm Workers because of their, }
legalistic and non-violent philo-5
sophy, centralization and top-
down controlof the Farm Workers}
Union, and the reliance of their
union on the AFL-CIO and the
Democratic Party. Needless to i;
say we still don’t eat grapes. -

It was originally billed as a
“visual orgasm” but the uptight

‘climate of groovy Pittsburgh

would not tolerate such figura-

 tive language. Nonetheless, So-
‘lar System Light and Power Co-

mpany will be staging its first

 I’ “visual orgasm” (light show if you
I perfer) Friday evening at the

William Penn Hotel ballroom.

’ Richard Fishkin and Harry
Greenberg, co-founders of Solar
System, informed us that “the
largest known strobe light in ex-
istence,” will be featured at the

5 .p happening. Black lights, four ov-

erhead projectors, three mirror-

_ ed balls and other optical ef-

fects will highlight the experi-

.,ence. In addition,_ a series of

‘special films and slides will be

~ projected along the walls of the
, room.

“The strobe will present time-
lapse illusion, much like an old-

-. — time movie,” Fishkin claims.

Two of the area’s top acid—rock

I , bands, Marshmallow Steamshovel

and.Mind Garage will perform.
Taped music of today’s leading
underground sounds will also’

. be heard "at the show.

“An assortment of freaks”
will be on hand accompanied by“;
many of Pittsburgh's’ finest, the co-
founders promised. "

“The Producers”

  

~ \

September 30, 1968."

by PAUL ANDERSON

Ever step out of a movie theatre
feeling like you've just had to
sit through a half dozen reels of
I Love Lucy reruns and the only
way to salvage what’s left of the
evening is to get completely
zonked? Well, the movie that one
has to drink to forget is The Pro-
ducers. It’s a real waste.

Written, produced and directed
by Mel Brooks, starring Zero
fMostel (he shoulda stayed on the
roof) and Gene Wilder with Dick
Shaw and Lee Meredith’s body.
The Producers is called The Pro-
ducers because it’s about produc-
ers. Clever. Mel Brooks (the pro-
ducer) thought of that. you can
tell.

Anyway, the film is about Max
Bialystock (Zero Mostel), a pro-

Company

until we establish a permanent

location.” V
Starting time is 8:30. Admission

will set you back three dollars.

-The co-founders advise everyone.

to come early to get the best se-
lection of free posters.

An advocate of political re-
form and welfare reform in Pitts-
burgh, William H. Rodd II,
will speak tomorrow at noon at

IFC To Support
Lower Voting Age  

voting age to eighteen. Chuck
Greene, IFC president. told
The Pitt News that he hopes oth-

. er campus organizations will en-

dorse the IFC resolution.

The proposal endorses Senator
Albert R. Pechan’s attempts to

lower the state voting age to eigh— 1

teen. IFC feels that the present
age restriction‘ has become a
weak criterion for delegating the
right to vote. The proposal states
that action by the Pennsylvania
legislature now will set “an im-
pressive and worthy precedent

that the rest of the nation might

easily follow.”

IFC acknowledges the increas-
ing intellectual maturity of Amer-
ican youth and their potential im-
portance in serving our country.
The,council believes that today‘s
youth deserve the “most con-
structive outlet possible through
which they can voice opinions
and become active members of our
political structure.” .

Greene said that copies. of the
IFC resolution have been given. to
Senator Pechan. and that support
of the IFC petition bythe aca-
demic communities of this and
other unieversitiesl will lead" to‘
positive action by the legis-
lature. .

Anyway, this is part of our living room-
the bedroom and dinette look just as sharp.
I How. can a couple of college guys like us
afford all this loaded luxury stuff, you ask?
Nope—we’re no Rockefeller kith or kin--just
typical students, nursing our ﬁnances along.

 
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
 
 
  
 

  
     

When we first rented this place we
figured to scrounge some furniture from the
folks, maybe get a piece or two from a second-
hand store and ﬁll in with a_ couple of orange
crates.

 

   

 
 

Then we read in the newspapers that
Sheffield rents furniture!

Know what we found out in a hurry?
We found we could rent three whole rooms
of beautiful furniture with no strain! My
buddy, Jeff, and I split the tab—$12.5U apiece
21 month, to be exact—and we have a place to
bug our friends eyes out!

  
   
  

\\\\\\\\\\

  
  
 
  
  
   

Sure . . . you can do it, too . . . whether I
you're students, or anybody! Ilust check in
with Sheffield F u-miture Renta at 1200 Cha-
teau St. and pick out the furniture you like.
It’ll come to maybe $25 to $30 a month in all!
Live in the lap of luxury like‘we do without it
knocking the old wallet for a loop!

P. S. If you want, they can also rent you a TV . . . a

pictures, paintings . . . almost anything you need with

Head coach Dave Hart, who
had expected a close game and a

was too overcome with frustration
and emotion to be his talkative
self. As he put it, “For the first

Linebacker Cindrich, who made

He had injuried_ an ankle at Mon-

most twice its size. Cindrich was
admitted for precautionary meas-

Weston was cited as one of the defensive stand-
outs for the Panthers Saturday, but he doesn’t feel
that he played up to potential. He does admit
though, that he played a more agressive type of
game Saturday than he did against UCLA in the

“I wasn’t as scared to do things against West‘
Virginia as I was the first time out. This was our
second game Saturday and I feel I really learned
a lot against UCLA.” He added, “Of course, you
learn a lot in all of them.

“West Virginia is a big rival game and I was
more prepared for it. The coaches said we weren’t

but couldn’t cope with the short
passing game of, WVU’s sopho-
more ‘quarterback Mike Sher-
wood. Sherwood, who was voted
the game’s outstanding player,
completed 27 of 37 tosses for 416
yards, and set three WVU school
recordsin the process.

-A good deal of that yardage
came after the pass was com-
pleted, when the Mountaineer
ends broke tackle after tackle for
the extra yardage. Tight end Bob
Zambo corralled eight tosses and
one TD and tailback Bob Gresh-
am was on the end of Sherwood’s
only bomb for a 73 yard touch-
down. — '

The West Virginia defensive
line kept the Panther rushers bot-
tled up, as they limited them to
56 yards, and only three in the
first half. WVU’s front four were
credited with 18 tackles and 14
assists,\while the Panther defen-

V sivejlinehad only two tackles and

21 assists.

After failing to establish a run-
ning game in the first quarter the
Panther offense had to take to the
air to move the ba-ll. Quarterback
Dave Havern, scrambling an d
rolling out as compared to Sher-
wood’s calm drop-back style hit
on 16 of 29 passes for 264 yards
and_ one touchdown.

The one touchdown came on a
brilliant 68-yard play to split end
Skip Orszulak. Orszulak caought
Havern’s pass on his fingertips at
the Pitt 48-yard line and outraced
the Mountaineer secondary to the
goal line. Orszulak finished the

-day with three receptions for 110
yards, the leading ground gainer
of the game. ,

Commenting on the touchdown,
Havern said that the play was
pointed out to him by Joe Mc-
Cain in the huddle and on Joe’s
advice he called it. The same
play’ worked later in the game
when Havern called it as an au-
dible at the line of scrimmage and

hit Orszulak again, this time for g

28 yards and a first down. ,

CARRYING THE» BALL like a loaf of bread, fullback Jeff Brown looks'for a few extra
yards of running room. Brown was the leading ground gainer for-the Panthers against
WVU, but his ball-carrying technique may have cost a touchdown as he fumbled on the
two-yard line early in the game. This week Brown is switching over to defense.

wide safety Ron Pobolish had in-

’ tercepted a Dave Havern pass on

the West Virginia three and one-
half yard line, the Mountaineers’
Gresham fumbled and John Woz-
niak recovered for Pitt. It took
the Panthers three plays to score,
with Havern faking a pitch-out
and carrying the ball in for the
touchdown from the three by him-
self. A two-point conversion pass
to J. D. Lewis capped the Pan-
ther scoring.

-Pitt had many other opportun-
itites to score but booted them
away. In the first quarter defen-
sive end -Paul Naponick blocked
a Thad Kucherawy punt and John
Stevens recovered the pigskin on

the WV seven yard line. That ad-

vantage was quickly lost as full-
back Jeff Brown fumbled on the

two yard line after catching a '

Havern pass.

In the second quarter Havern
scored on an 11-yard burst up the
middle, only to see the play nul-
lified by an illegal procedure
penalty. Alf in all, the Panthers
fumbled six times, with tackle
Art Alois recovering the ball three
times for Pitt, had four passes in-

CONFERENCE LEKOMA (bottom) gets an extra push from a West
Chesteropponent while trying to head_ the ball during Saturday’s 4-0 -
loss to the Rams. Lekoma was expected to add scoring punch this year,

but the hooters have been blanked twice so far.

by BILL NAAB

Coach Jim Banner’-s _cross country squad overwhelmed the
opposition, and Jerry Richey broke another courserecord, in what

seems to be becoming typical performances.

Banner’s squad was credited with 23 points followed by Bowling
Green’s 47 points and Buffalo State’s 65 points. Richey’s record - break-
ing 21:59 performance led the pack. Bowling Green’s Sid Sink ran sec-

finish in 22:17._ -

Paul Zink and Greg Rodgers
of Pitt followed with times of
22:23 and 22:32. respectively,
while Mike Nolan, 22:58, and Ken-
ny Lawton, 23:21, took sixth and
seventh place finishes. Bowling
Green’s Ausderan grabbed the
eight spot in the time of 23:26.
Harrier Mark Vornhagen’s 23:30
and Bill Matajasic’s 23:44 rounded
out the top finishes. John Aiken, '
who ended in thirteenth place, was
the only member of Banner’s trave-
ling squad who did not finish, in
the top ten.

Moreover, in rating the three
squads, freshmen coach Gary
Meckleyvcommented that Buf-
falo State is rebuilding and has
a respectable freshmen team. He
also stated that their varsity is im-
proved over last season, even
though Buffalo’s top runner, Chuck
Burrows did not finish in the top
ten. Burrows came in eleventh in
23:50.

Bowling Green has one outstand-
ing runner-Sid Sink. He’s a good
man,” Meckley remarked. “For
the first two and one half or
three miles, Sink and Talkington,
who’s also a pretty good runner,
weren’t too far from« ‘Richey.
But, in the last mile Richey just
took off.”

When Richey_ broke the 22:11
Buffalo course record, set by Cort-
1and’s Bob Lalky in 1965, Meckley
said that “Jerry just took it easy.
It wasn’t a real battle. He was
well ahead of the other runners.

A possible explanation as to why
Jerry Richey has set two course
records in succeeding weeks, Meck-
ley reasoned, is that “though
they're good records, Richey is
better than anyone ever running
the courses before. He’s an:inter-
national class runner, and he gain-
_ed invaluable experience at the

J

   

.ond in 22:08, while his teammate, Talkington registered'a third place

that Richey will be rested during
this entire week.. “He hasn't
stopped running since last Sep-
tember,” said Meckley.

In addition, Meckley indicated

that Mark Vornhagen will improve ,

as the season continues. Accord-
ing to Meckley, Vornhagen missed
the most important part of train-
ing, but should come back strong.

Moreover, Meckley related
that the flat course was a problem.
He said that “we’ve done little
flat running, and that type’ of
course throws us off. We’ve been
pointing ahead for the next few
weeks,” and we probably could
have done better.” .

Meanwhile the freshmen only
placed two runners in the top
ten, while finishing third. Ken

Balky ran third, and Dave Cobb-

followed in the fourth position.

Soccer Team

West Chester Triu

by ED CONLEY

». .‘  W 
.3...

.'v.\

It was another loss for the soccer team, Saturday. But, the
4-0 setback against West Chester ‘didn’t have normal effect of

defeat.

This was because the team knew they were beaten by one of the
best squads they will play. “I told their coach (Mel Lorback) they’ve
got their best team in 5 or 6. years. He agreed,” booter coach Leo Bemis

remarked. :

Coach Lorback’s Rams, who
have gone to four NCAA tour-
neys in the last five years, may
have found an All-American.
Lineman Joe Elwell banged in all
four Ram goals and ‘looked great
on his third point. With only 22
seconds gone in the second half,
he knocked a perfect head shot
beyond goalie Len Harmon.

It was the second_ shut—out in
a row for the booters, but their
coach felt his . players - played
much better this time. “We play-
ed a" better game than last week.
We took the shots we had this time,”
Bemis said.

The one thing that did upset
Bemis was that the kickers kept
the ball in the air far too often.
He mentioned, “We’ve got to keep '
the ball on the ground. Those guys
were all taller than us.” '

The height was one tremendous
advantage for West Chester. They

also had an edge in speed, which
was particularly evident on the
booter’s inbound plays.

“We got the ball in a lot in
the first half. They had the speed
to cut the ball off, though. We
could have just as easily thrown
the ball in the middle,” Bemis
stated.

He added, “You just have to ex-
ecute.”

It’s pretty hard to execute when
the team is admittedly better
than you. That’s why the kickers
are_waiting for their next game
which is at Slippery Rock, next
Saturday.

“We'll kill Slippery Rock,”

lineman Lou Vida snarls.

Vida was one of the stand-outs
in the loss_to the Rams. He didn’t
score, of course, but he showed
fine ball control throughout ‘the
contest. 4

The booters defensive play

wasn’t as bad as a 4-0 score makes
it sound.‘ Fullback Mike Schalk

F rosh Duffers Outshine Varsity,
Finish Second in Golf Incvitational

by NICK PALAZZETTI

Despite a poor showing by the Pitt varsity
. squad, Friday’s Point Park Invitational Tourna-
ment ended on a hopeful note. The freshman
golfers, sparked by a fine performance from
Mike Jones, finished second in a field of eight
teams. Jones tied for second place in individual

scoring with an 80.

Rich Worsham of Indiana State was the tourna-
ment medalist. He fired a 78 to lead his team to
victory total of 324 while the second-place frosh
posted a team total of 338 points. Point Park finished
third; in the competition with Walsh of Canton, Ohio
placing fourth and St. Vincent's taking fifth place.
Geneva was sixth with 362 team points, followed
closely by C.M.C. with 363 points. Pitt's varsity plac-

19-ll



Low man form the varsity was Mike McGuire, who
fired an 83. The varsity duffers, badly undermanned
for the tourney, finished in last place.

Tournament scores at the long and difficult Cham-
pion Lakes Golf Course were exceptionally high as
the 7000-yard layout and windy playing condidtions
took their toll on the golfers. Of the forty golfers who
competed in the competition, only one finished be-
low eighty and many of the players finished in the
high nineties." v ’ r » . ' » '

five starters.

The freshman, who_gave a good account of them-
selves in Friday’s competition, promise even better
things for the regular season. With players such as
Tim Crist, Rich Plonka, and Mike Jones on the
squad, Coach Peery’s hopes are high for golf improve-
ment during the 1969 season. Incidently, Jones is
