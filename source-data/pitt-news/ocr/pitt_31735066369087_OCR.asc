The Office of Student Activities underwent a wave of reassign-
ments yesterday when William Markus, acting vice-chancellor for
student affairs, filled slots left vacant by the resignation of Willard
'.‘~‘Bud” Heaps and the dismissal of Jack Brown as advisor to the
ritt Union Program Council.

Terrance Milani has been named acting director ofthe Office of
Student Activities, while continuing in his former position as
associate director of the office. Milani will be directly responsible
to Markus in performing his duties of‘ overseeing the planning and
evaluation of the Pitt Union Program Council, supervising the
Student Union renovation project and acting as advisor to the
Student Government Board.

“With the recent resignation of Willard Heaps as director of
student activities it -has become necessary to shift several staff
responsibilities to ensure that all campus constituencies receive the

necessary attention,” Markus said.

Other major changes within the office include the reassignment

of_ advising duties for the Pitt Union Program Council. Instead of

having a single advisor overseeing the entire organization, two ad- :

visors have been assigned to the council; e
Nancy Evans, assistant directoriofr student affairs, will assume

 . the duties of advisor to the SGB allocations cominittee, super-

visor of, the renumerations board and advisor to the Special Event-,

tees, advisor to the lnter-Honorary Council, advisor to recognized
student organizations and liason to the University Chaplain
Association.

B_rown has been assigned also to evaluate and develop programs
for leadership development and student voluntary efforts. 7

Gary Houston, assistant to Markussaid that Brown's reassign-
ment was not ‘directly related to the.’Chuck Mangione
Homecoming Week controversy or the Black Action Society
dissatisfaction with the program council's failure to provide a
Black Week concert. ’

“The purpose of this reassignment not intended to be punitive
or place any direct blame for what occurred,” Marcus said. “We

moved Wednesday to allow the\Pitt Out .

of South Africa Coalition a chance to
recognized student
organization, in hopes that the coalition
can meet directly with the University’s
board of trustees to express its stand for_
divestiture from corporations with in-
terests in South Africa.

The SGB reached a stalemate at last
week’s meeting when a proposal to reaf-
firm the board’s prior support of
divestiture and a proposal to support
the Sullivan Principles, which has
University support, were both defeated.

The coalition is to supply the Board
with a constitution, a membership list
and other pertinent information, and
the Board will vote next week on of-
ficially recognizing the coalition,
without supporting it financially.

The idea for such a move came into

‘the foreground when Bob Wagner of

the coalition said the board of trustees

 refused todeal with the group.
.“They officially told us, ‘You can't
talk to us anymore.’ You can deal with

us through the Student Government,”

Wagner said. . ,

During the discussion, board member
Diane Behers reiterated an idea she has
expressed at earlier meetings concerning
the South Africa question. “I think our
job is to provide a mechanism for the
coalition to get to the board of
trustees,”

Near the end of the meeting, SGB
President Joshua Baylson put Behe'r’s
idea into the approved motion to allow

the coalition to submit an application»

for official__recognition.

Later, board member Dave Hesidence
said'of the action. “In my opinion, we
will grant the recognition and recall the
motion to support divestiture. I think
‘the board’s move was good because we
don’t have enough information on the
technological and economical aspects
of these questions (about divestiture and
the South African situation in general).

The Inter-Residence Board

Wednesday voted to support a
drive by the Housing Task Force
demanding a vote on the new room
assignment lottery system. The
Board also endorsed at its special
meeting a compromise room
assignment system.

Kim Biehl, .a Tower C resident

 and a member of the task force,

urged the board to support efforts
to gain a vote by students.

“Over the last week, we have‘

found what rights students have
_ (1 what students can do,” Biehl
sa d. “These petitions might not

but whatever (room assignment
proposal) you support, the fact that
you support the vote will only help
you.”
 Biehl added that the group had

already collected 2,865 student
signatures and planned to present
them at the Student Affairs
Adivsory Council no matter what
decision the board makes.

Fred ‘Fonseca, director of the
Office of Residence Life, raised
questions about the way the task
force had been soliciting

signatures for the petitions, which

ask that students be given the right
to have a binding vote on the new
room assignment system.

Fonseca said that any vote could
lead to a return to the old first
come, first serve system, which he
thought would not be an answer to
the problem of room assignment.
He said also that the cover letter
originally attached to the petition
had some inaccuracies in it.

.“I keep hearing the right to vote,
the right‘ to vote,” Fonseca said.

He added that if anyone asked him i

to sign a petition to give him the
right to vote, he would certainly
sign it.

Biehl answered Fonseca’s
statements and said that there had
been criticism ‘of the task force
because some people did not feel it
was emphasized enough that the
petition supported the right to vote
on the room assignment. She said
that students soliciting signature s
had been instructed to stress that
point, and she also pointed out that
the cover letter containing the
inaccuracies had been‘ removed
from all petitions since.Tuesday.

“I think people knew what they
were signing and that it (the
petition) was for the right to vote,”

Biehl said. .

The McCormick compromise
approved by -the resident board
would combine _lottery and first
come, first serve room assignment

systems to make a new system that

would satisfy student supporters of _

the lottery and first come, first
serve system.

Under the compromise proposal,
applications would be mailed to all
resident students. Tables would be
set up at ,points on campus during

students would have their ap-
plications marked “lotterv” or
“line.” Students’ validation cards

In other business, it was announced
that SGB member Stan Galanski has
been voted vice-chairman of the Pen-
nsylvania Student Association of State
Related Universities.

Galanski commented on his new
position: “One of the problems in the
past (with the association) is that there
has been no one at the helm...in the
vice-chairmanship, I think we will have '

V considerable control of the leadership.”.

Galanski said Pitt’s representatives to
the group will begin hoiding weekly or
biweeklylmeetings in order to keep its‘
positions clear. ‘ ‘

Galanski’s election was announced by
Martin Bostocchi, Pitt’s representative

to the association’s recent meeting at ‘

Bostocchi reported on the meeting;

“There was a united effort (by‘

association members Pitt, Penn State," '

financial aid from the legislature.”

The Univeristy Faculty

,Assembly moved yesterday to
V. endorse a report by the Senate

Committee on Athletics, calling for
the Chancellor's support of a
variety of changes within the
personnel and budgetary structure
of [Pitt's intramural and
recreational program. ’

The resolution calls specifically
for the shift of both the budget and
personnel of athletic facilities from

the athletic department's control A

to the physical education depar-
tment.
William Rudoy, chairman of the

Senate Committee on_ Athletics, .j.~..:.,-6f the Committee’ commented on

outlined the work that his group
has done leading up to the passage
of yesterday’s proposal.

Rudoy said that the committee

' was designed last winter to deal

with a number of complaints from
students, faculty and staff con-
cerning the availability of the
Trees Hall athletic facilities. The
chairman said that some priorities
must be reached in the scheduling
of groups for the use of Trees Hall.
“We haven't had the con-

 

Uilty Asse

struction of a major athletic
facility since 1964, and when the
Cathedral gym and the gym
beneath Pitt Stadium were closed
this cut the space considerably,”
Rudoy said.

He added that his committee
endorses continued support for the
Leisure Learning Program in-
volving Oakland children in

r organized sports.

“Although the demand on the
facilities has increased tremen-
dously we want ‘to continue our
support of these, programs,”
Rudoy said.

._Dr. James J. Zaslov, a member

the Leisure Learning Program.
“Leisure learning , receives
$50,000 a year from the University
to help these children, but I think
it’s worth it,”_ Zaslov said. “It’s a

good program with good
coaching. ’ ’
Ken Metz of the physical

education department spoke out in
favor of the group’s support of the
resolution to transfer the budget

and personnel. Metz’ department...

To Reform Intramurals Program

does not control these programs

because of the incompatibility
between the two.
“Intramurals and student

. recreation are both advertised by

the admissions office in recruiting
students,” Metz said. “But I don’t
think either of these two should be
tied to a winning or losing football
team. Very few schools leave it
under the athletic department for
this reason.”

Other positions also supported in
the report include: - (

+Opening of athletic facilities to
those hours similar to those ob-
served by the Hillman Library,
from 7-11 pm.

+Schedule

on weekends. .

+Restri.ct the use of Trees Hall
by outside groups, charging an
occassional fee for use.

+The institution of‘ rec-
comendations that would make the

facilities accessible to students at

A hypothetical example included
in the compromise best shows how
thesystem would work. According
to the proposal, there would be
2,800 applicants and 1,936 spaces
available.

system and 280 people wanted to be
assigned by the line system. 1.742

’ spaces. -,

The students who opted for the
lottery would then draw numbers
from fishbowls to see if they
received a room. In the

hypothetical case, those who drew

numbers between 1 and 1,742 would
receive rooms. Males and females

_ would draw from separate bowls.

Men ‘and women who wanted to
apply using the first come, first
serve method would report to
designated areas with their
identification and application. ‘A
waiting list would be determined
according to the numbering of the
applicant’s acceptance. date.

also requires that, if less than 1
percent of the students opt for on e
of the systems, all the students
must use the same room assign-
ment method. Students must apply

individually for a room under both’

the lottery and line systems.
However, a student who is unable
to stand in line for some reason
could designate a person to submit
his application.

Steve Bair, secretary of the
Bruce Hall residence hall council,
spoke in support of the com-
promise, during the meeting. “My
personal opinion is that this is the
best proposition. It gives /the Office
of Residence Life and ‘the Housing
Office a chance to move ahead
slowly,” he said. “It gives
everyone a chance to see which
system is going to work better.”

Fonseca questioned whether the
board could evaluate and make a
decision on the compromise after
seeing it only briefly. “I think this
is an extremely difficult decision
for you to make as a board. You
are making a decision about a
proposal I saw 10 or 15 minutes 380
for the first time. I wonder how
much time you had to look at it,”
Fonseca said.

Fonseca also spoke about a

You saw our

fcilshion Issue

section in the compromise
proposal that suggested ways to
deal with any pushing, shoving or
fights in the line for the first come,
first serve lines.

The proposal calls for campus
police to rope a barricade to create
an organized line. Each person
would be allowed to leave the line
for a half—hour every five hours if

there was an unduly long line.
Anyone involved in any alter-
cations in the line would be

removed and placed at the bottom

of the waiting list.

Despite the controversy surroun-
ding the new lottery room assign-
ment system, many students do not
understand the new system or the
possible aternatives to the lottery
system. .

Joan Broadfield‘, treasurer of th
Inter-Residence Board, summed up
the problem during the board's
meeting Wednesday night. Broad-
field said she had confusion thrown
right back in her face whenever she
tried to explain the new system.

‘'1 tell people about the system
and people still don’t understand,”
she said.

The lottery system, which will be
used next term unless the am-
dinistration reverses its decision,
would reserve rooms for freshmen,
athletes, handicapped, resident
assistants, chancellor’s scholars and

provost’s scholars. A

The 1,936 "spaces available after
these reservations would be assigned
to the seniors, juniors
sophomores not included in the

special groups that receive reserved _

rooms. Ten percent of these rooms
would -go to seniors, 20 percent to
juniors and 30 percent to
sophomores. \ -

Firgures compiled from head-
counts by "the Resident Student
Association and from resident
assistant evaluations show 'this new
system would not change the num-
ber of residents of different classes
that live in the dorms.

According to these figures, the
population of dormitories would be
13 percent seniors, 22 percent
juniors, 30 percent sophomores, and
35 percent freshmen. These figures
are not significantly different from
the last two years. ‘

Opinion

A Lackof
Participation

law‘.

The Student Government Board assembly, a
much-heralded and positive step toward getting more
students involved, hit new lows at its “special”
meeting last Tuesday. '

"There wasn’t a quorum on hand when the assem-
bly--comprising representatives from student
organizations--met at a specially called meeting to
discuss proposals to change policy and structure of
the Pitt Union Program Council. ’

There are two reasons why there should be so
many absentees from such an important meeting: (1)

those members are satisfied with the job the program I

council has done and. have no movitation to attend
such a meeting, or (2). student apathy again raises its
ugly head. ’ ’

_If.t_hose'missing organizations want a voice in

Student’ Government, they should attend the
meetings. If they believe there is no reason in their

7 minds to complain or change the program council,
they still should have been there to defendit. If they" ' '

have solutions to theproblems the council faces, they
were sorelv missed. ‘ .

The members of the SGB assembly who did bother I

to show up listened as College Young Democrats
representative Bob Daley and Black Action Society
chairman Marc Holloway did most of the talking. ,
No vote was taken, even though the proposals were
made—there weren’t enough members present. No
majority of student-organization opinion was
discovered, no positive steps taken toward the

Page 4—Friday, November 17, 19.78

ween SGB, the Office of Student Affairs and the
program council, and the demand that $80,000 of
SGB-allocated money be returned to‘ Student Gover-
nment—which is ridiculous, since the program coun-
cil doesn’t have that much left in its budget—received
any air play. Even still, the decision upon those
issues must wait until the next assembly meeting,
which is scheduled to happen November 20.

The assembly is a good- idea, and one step closer to

. giving students a strong voice in Student GOVCI'Il—l

ment. Too bad many student organizations decided
not to bother getting involved. The absentees turned
a productive meeting into a waste of time and ruined

($1,

the assembly’s ‘plans to play a vital role in Student? a

Government and business that affects them.

 Finding the Way to Harrisburg Via the Lobby

By MIKE KANE

Pennsylvania House of Represen-

~ . tatives Bill 1425, legislation to reduce

‘the .penalties for possession of

' marijuana from a possible jail sentence

and a maximum fine of $500 to a sum-

_  offense with a $100 fine, came up

1 I . for,_a vote Wednesday during the House

It

I session. It was killed, 124-66.

This marked the first time a
.decriminalization bill survived as far as
a vote, and when the House decided,
176-8, to vote on it Monday, proponen-
tsof the bill saw that margin as an op-
tomistic sign. .

Todd Park, chairman of the Public

' and Governmental Relations Commit-
tee, expressed his disappointment at the

: outcome of the vote.

“What’s hard to understand is how it
went from, 176-8 (the untable vote)
to 66-124 (the actual vote)," Park said.
From what people told me, it's just'in-
ternal politics. Somebody just didn’t
want to see it passed badly enough.”

Park, however, isn’t giving up.
“What we’re going to do next is set up a
NORML (National Organization for the
Reform of Marijuana Laws) Chapter
here at Pitt_and set up a grassroots cam-
paign with letter writing and education

of the students about NORML and

decriminalization.”

"It probably will be reintroduced
next February,” he added, ”and come
up for a vote around this time next
year."

I lobbied with the committee in
Harrisburg on Monday, and if it takes
another lobbying trip to push the bill
through next year, I'd be happy to go
again.

I’d never lobbied before, never seen
the Capitol building in Harrisburg,
never thought I’d ever go there to lobby.

When I went with the committee to
lobby for the house’s approval of
decriminalization of marijuana, what I
expected to happen, and what actually
did happen were often two different,
things.

Most importantly, not one of the four
representatives 1 tracked down brushed
me off, as I expected to happen. They
all listened seriously to my argument for
decriminalization and didn’t repeat the
expected cliches about marijuana
causing moral decay or turning users in-
to zombies.

There were a few incidents that
caused my stereotype of politicians (hot-
aired, phony) to surface, but they were
more humorous than anything else.

Representative Ron Gatski, (D.-
Luzeme County), changed my name to

, Mark in the middle of .our talk and

ignored my correction. "He was against
decriminalization, he said, because he
had a “real tough media” in his district,
and could imagine headlines sayinghc

endorses pot smoking. After 20 minutes .

of talking with him and unable to
change his mind, I got up'_to leave. He

got up and shook my hand and said

warmly, “Thank you, ‘Mark, it’s been a
pleasure talking to you." I wonder if he
gets his voters! names right.

Adam Bittenger, the representative

from Johnstown, my home district, lost .

his re-election bid by a close margin and

i didn’t even try to hide his bitterness. He 1

complained to me about ‘being cam-
paigned against “from the pulpit.” He
said he would vote in favor of
decriminalization only if the bill had a
chance of passing. He reasoned that if

the bill was bound to lose, why upset his '

constituents, who are, as a rule, conser-
vative? He sounded as if he'll be run-
ning for office again soon.
On the whole, it seemed the
legislators I talked to were aware the
current marijuana laws were too strict.
One representative told me he became
aware of the weight of the issue when he
“smelled it” in his son’s car. He said

“ I DON? cane

’he was undecided ho'w he would vote

because of his conservative constituen-
cy, butvmade an interesting proposition
about who "is for and who is against
decriminalization. He said younger.‘
people, of course, . are for
decriminalization, and their parents also
are, because they have beenreducated to

the nature of marijuana by their '_

children. Hesaid it is the age in between 4
these two, the parents of: kids who are
just entering or in their early teens, who
are afraid of decriminalization.

Some advice for anyone who_ might
someday lobby in the Capitol building.
Offices numbered in the 600’s are on the
fifth floor, and a 500’s office I tried to
find is on a" floor marked “E.”~
Whoever numbered the offices must
have been smoking marijuana at the
same time. -‘ l

I spent a few minutes in the visitors’s
booth and watched the House of

Representatives in session. Maybe one-

fourth of the 203 representatives were

absent, except for any of -the lawmakers
who wanted to say something, the rest

of those« in attendance completely
ignored the House speaker; They, were

handshaking i and backslapping,
(probably offering the appropriate’

congratulations or condolences, as ‘this
was the first session after the recent elec-
tions and the newly elected represen-
tatives won’t take office until January.
; According to an employee, the sessions

were always that noisy, and it was'far .

‘worse than any boring college lecture
class I’ve sat through. ., ‘ '

Although the decriininalization vote A

was defeated, I think it.was worth the
effort to put on a coat and ‘tie and leave
Pittsburgh at "five in the morning (it
would have been 4;30 but another per-
son and I overslept) to talk to , the
representatives. -I learned something. .

Stackpole’s (floudy Report

In regard to Harry Stackpole’s review
of the Weather Report concert of Nov.
9, it is obvious that Stackpole’s,
knowledge of jazz in general and of the ‘
Weather Report in particular are vastly

. inadequate to enable him to review such

a concert. Having seen Weather Report
in concert on other occasions, I can say
to even attempt improvisation on the

. level done bythis band requires an

enormous amount of talent and
technique. Stackpole seems to be at a
loss to understand what happens on the
stage before him. ‘

Stackpole’s /research for his article
also left much to be desired. Jaco
Pastorius replaced Alphonso Johnson
as Weather Report's bassist, not
Miroslav Vitous as reported. Vitous
had departed two years earlier when
Johnson joined the band.

Finally, Weather‘Report’s live music
has little if anything to do with its
recorded music. If Stackpole is in-
terested only in the latter, I suggest he
stay near his stereo and away from the
concert hall. Someone with no idea of

a_ what a top jazz band will attempt in

concert will be lost quickly.

Indeed, Stackpole does not even ap-
pear to have been aware of what in-
struments were being used or for what

talents certain memebers of the band are
renowned. To refer repeatedly to
Wayne Shorter as the band’s “brass
man” shows a definite’ lack of

jazz’s most prominent woodwind
artist.
Reviewing a concert means more than

finding someone to use the free tickets;

I suggest your future reviews be en-
trusted to someone knowledgeable

enough to be aware of what is hap- 1":

pening onstage, someone-better able to
appreciate the talents of the performers.

_their new album,

Performance a Triumph

By GARY L. TWEED
Pitt News Staff Writer
High energy rock-that was Triumph
as it made its American debut in Pit-
tsburgh Tuesday night at the Stanley.

The Canadian group is composed of
three members; Rik Emmett, all guitars
and vocals; Gil Morree on drums, per-
cussion and vocals, and Mike Levine on
bass and keyboards.

The three, “Tri” - umph, produce a

' sound somewhere between Rush and

Led Zeppelin. Despite a small crowd,
the audience was hard-core rock fans

. who stood throughout most of the con-

cert clapping and cheering -wildly. The
show itself featured a light show
designed by the members of the group.
It featured exploding bombs, a mirror
ball, strobe lights and a‘ light-trimmed
stage with “Triumph” illuminated
behind the group.

The show consisted of the songs on
“Rock and Roll
Machine” as well as some material from
the four sides of music released in
Canada but unavailable, as yet, in the
United States.

The songs performed included “24

, Hours a Day,” “Takes Time (T 0 Make

Time),” “Street Fighter“ and “Rock
and Roll Machine.”

One of the most moving songs was
“Blinding Light Show/Moo-nchild,”

  

m-..a......~~.

which began as a rock song, switched to ,

a classical guitar--almost Spanish
Flamingo beat the ledg into a Russian
folk beat, climazing with metal music.
Emmett proved himself master of guitar
on this one.‘

This song was also accompanied by
stunning lighting effects, beginning with
the mirror ball and ending with flame,

smoke, and ﬂashing emergency lights
aimed at the audience, as well as fog.

Smoke ﬁlled the auditorium until the
singers were obscured, and blinding
white floodlights shone out at the
audience. ‘

Before “Rock and Roll Machine,”
Gil Moore declared: ‘‘I will do anything
for you people, anything. I'll give you
my soul, pour it out right here on the
stage. No, I take that. back. There is
one thing I won’t do. There is one thing
I will not do. That is play disco because
disco..." .

And that sums up Triumph--good old
rock ’n’ roll, not commercial AM
music. '

Prior to the headliner was another
debut by a new group called The Boyzz.
The Boyzz is composed of six talented
musicians sporting a rugged look,
rugged -music and a rugged image. As
yet, their appearance is somewhat more
rugged than the music can fulfill.

to conduct an interview. The rooms are extremely small-—hardly
big enough for the group to change in, let alone have twenty or so
people from RCA walking around exchanging cordial
congratulations to the group, dollar signs aglow in their eyes. _
Champagne flowed and I settled down to talk with the guitarist
and vocalist for Triumph, Rick Emmett. When I could discern
Emmett’s ‘voice among the RCA people, we discussed Trimph’s
beginning as a group, and some of the problems musicians face on
the road.
Pitt News: Is this your first American tour?
Emmett: “We've been to Texas a couple times before but this is
v our first major tour. Our record is produced by RCA, and there is
a. lot of promotion going on, and we’re doing .22 shows in 30
days.”
Pitt News: When did your “big break” come?

Emmett: “The big break for me camewhen they (Gil Moore 4
and Mike Levine) asked me to join the group. That was my big

break. Triumph broke ‘big when we played in Toronto in a place

Pitt News:
Triumph?

Emmett: It was Gil’s idea. We went through a bunch of names
and Triumph was good ’cause, well, for a three piece band, of‘
course, the ‘Tri’ is neat, and it signifies the sort of victorious, suc-
cessful, celebration--all good positive "things, which. is what we
wanted the band to be. So that’s the name of that tune.

Pitt News: So how do you view your first experience on the
road? I

Emmett: Well, it has its advantages and it has its disadvantages.
You know its fun now--sitting here talking to you ’cause you think
-I'm important and going on stage in front of all -those people who

that they got "back alone to their motel rooms, fly to a new _citf_l.%.

Pitt News: Some of the more seasoned performers have told us: 
each day, which they may not know where they are until right

P‘ before the show, and that it gets boring and muchylike a job to

them.

Emmett: That’s all true. That’s a large part of it and youcan
become lost in it. Hopefully, I’ll be able to main_tain a little more
of my sanity than that. I don’t have any sort of a drug problem or
an alcohol problem. Some of the people you’re talking about
develop those (habits) as crutches.‘ I’m not a real crazy partyerj’

Pitt News: Why do you think other performers develop such
crutches? ' _ ‘

- Emmett: - I think it helps t-hem cope with ‘loneliness and
boredom. The French have a term “Jonoui,” which is like
repeativeness taht makes you tired. I think that’s why they resort .f
to those things‘. We get along good and have fun and as long as
that’s there, I don’t think the other things will become a -factor.

Parion Topic of New Song

The Annual Fall Flower Show is currently on ‘display at

  

,,,, _  ..  ,'..‘, . .\..\v.. » - .     .... .,   '-

By The Associated Press

First there were Dolly Parton dolls.
Then Dolly Parton look-a-like contests.
Now, inevitably, there is a song about
the dazzling vocalist. ' _

Titled “Dolly” and recorded by R.W.
Blackwood, Jr., the song traces her
career from the time she left her family
home in the Smoky Mountains to her
current "status as one of the country's
most talked-about celebrities.

It was written in just 30 minutes--like
Parton’s clothes, a tight fit.

Unlike Johnny Carson's monologues,
which are laced with jokes about her,
the song is a serious summary of‘Par-
ton's achievements. '

‘‘It simply tells the story of Dolly Par-
ton," said Blackwood, best known for
his country hit “Sunday Afternoon
Boat Ride in the Park on the Lake” two
years ago. “lt’s not a gimmick or a
novelty thing. This doesn't play off that
at all. I think she’d be flattered.”

Parton, selected entertainer of the
year this year by the Country Music
Association, has been on a European
tour all month and was unavailable for

‘ ecornment.

“She has said she wished people
would look inside her and not just think
of -her because of her appearance with
the wigs and all,” said Blackwood,
whose wife is a Dolly look-alike. (“This
song does look inside her.”

‘‘I was expecting a gimmick song
when I first was told about it. But it was
better than I expected. It’s a well writ-
ten song--a good tune.”

Buzz Cason, who co-wrote the song
with Austin Roberts, also wrote one of
the first songs Parton recorded some 12
years ago. ‘rThlS was before she teamed
with Porter Wagoner to add her own
sparkle to Wagoner’s rhinestones.

“I wanted to make it traditional
sounding and like a Tennessee son 
Cason said. “I wanted to make it ‘a

tribute--not a ripoff.”

By BOB LABRIOLA
Pitt News Staff Writer

Pitt’s game with Army has been
"the biggest game of the year the
last three seasons. ,

In 1976 Pitt was in the midst of
trouncing a 4-5 Army team, 37-7,
when the announcement that
Purdue had upset top—ranked
Michigan sent the crowd into a
frenzy. The Panthers were at the
top of the polls for the first time in
39 years. '

In 1977 Pitt needed a big win over
the Cadets to prove to bowl scouts
that a season-opening loss to Notre
Dame and a tie with Florida were
not indicative of the quality of its
team. Fifty-two points later, the
Panthers had secured their third
consecutive bowl bid.

Tomorrow Pitt has to avoid the
‘strong temptation to overlook an
Army team that not only lost to
Virginia, but also was shut out by
Holy Cross, 31-0. The temptation

I certainly will bethere: Pitt finally

-got its offensive machine firing on
all cylinders last Saturday against
West Virginia and has a chance to
ruin Joe Paterno’s plans for New
Year’s Day next week in State
College. But a loss to the Cadets
would scare away the remaining
bowl scouts, and the Panthers

 

  

would find themselves home for
the holidays. ‘

Army has been struggling.

through a season of injuries and
hasn’t been at full strength since
the first day of fall camp. Five
more Cadets went down last week
against Boston College, but the
most costly injurywas the one to
middle guard George Mayes. I

“This rash of injuries has really
hurt our team,” said Army coach
Homer Smith. “That has been
more of a problem to us this year
than moving the ball.”

When the Cadets do move the
ball, it usually is in the hands of
quarterback Erle Mulrane, run-
ning back Jimmy Hill or tight end
Clennie Brundidge. Hill is leading
the Army infantry corps with a 4.1-
yards-a-carry average and has
scored seven touchdowns.

Although Mulrane is not the
passer Leamon Hall was, he
usually only has to get the ball in
the general direction of Brtmdidge

for a completion. ‘Nearly half of '
'Mulrane’s completions have gone

to the senior target, who_averages
17.5 yards a catch and has hauled
in three touchdown passes. . ‘

Army is a balanced offensive"
unit, but allows nearly as many

   

Prepared for Army Field Maneuvers

yards as it is able to accumulate
itself. The Cadets employ a 52
defensive alignment, which frees
the linebackers, John Hilliard and
Kirk Thomas, to make most of the
tackles. With Mays on the
sidelines, the Cadets will turn to
defensive end Chuck Shott to put
pressure on Rick Trqcano.

Army is neither a team that
takes advantage of the big play,
nor one that beats itself with many
turnovers. While the Cadets have
shown a tendency to fumble the
football, Army has forced three
more turnovers than it has given
up this -year. ’ - "

If the Panthers are not able to
win this year’s big game with the
Cadets, they will not receive a bowl
invitation. They won’t deserve
one.

PITT NOTES: Ralph Still pulled
a hamstring and is out for at least
two weeks. Greg Meisner may
play tomorrow, but Jerry Boyarski
will be the starting tackle along
with Bill Neill-...Army is averaging
19 points a game...The Cadets have
18 interceptions this season...Pitt
leads the series, 13-6-2, with the
last Army victory at Pitt Stadium
in 1972...Stadium officials expect a
crowd of 45,000. for the Panthers’-
final home game.

Carter Exceeds Goal,

By KAREN KADILAK_
Pitt News Staff Writer

Russell Carter’s only goal before
this football season was to make the
traveling squad. Already having
accomplished this, the freshman
from Paulsboro, N .J ., has another
goal heading into Pitt’s ﬁnal two
games. ~

‘ ‘.1 hope to play against Army and ,»

just want us to beat Penn State,”
said Carter, who scored his first
collegiate touchdown 'Saturday_. “I
don’t even". care, if  play against
Penn State, just as long as we win. ’ ’
‘ Backing up starting running
backs Rooster Jones, Fred Jacobs
and Larry Sims, Carter has gained
22 yards on eight carries in the last
three games.
“I never thought I would play as

- , much as I have,” said Carter,.who

missed the first two games» with a
toe injury. “I knew I would play,
but not so soon in my career.”

Carter has played more than any
other first-year running back.

“We have a number of talented
freshmen running" backs,” said Joe
Moore, the Panthers’ offensive
backﬁeld coach. “Unfortunately,
many of them have been either

injured or ill and have missed some .

playing time.~.

t Makes Traveling Squad  

“Russell played well Saturday,”
Moore continued. “He has the
ability and desire to become a very
good running back. It's up tohim
how good he wants to be. 'We aren’t
setting any goals for him. Those
goals will have to. come from
within.”

At 6-foot-2, 195-pounds, Carter "is
one of Pitt's biggest running backs,

jcausing speculation the Panthers
plan to add abig back to its attack.

‘ ‘Russell’s playing because of his

ability andnot his size,” Moore}

said.

Considering himself neither a
halfback or fullback but a combina-
tion of both, Carter has the speed to
run outside and the strength to plow
through the -middle, where he
prefers to rum. I A

"‘I like running inside,” he said.
“Running there, you A can go
straight, left or right. But on the
outside, there is only one way to go
when you turn that corner—and that
is straight. If you go another way,
you’re bound to lose yardage."

Carter, who earlier this season
reeled off a 77-yard run in a junior

‘ii?

varsity game, averagedmore‘ than 5

six yards a carry in high» school. "i ‘

Hugh Green Tackle5 Problem of Wager Teammate I     A D  

By JIM PANE
Pitt News Staff Writer
Hugh Green’s performance at
Pitt's right defensive end has not
gone unnoticed over the past two
years—especially by the opposi-
tion. Green’s All-Americaabilities,
however, somehow fail to stand up
to a bet Green made with teammate
Al Chesley.

The wager is a worthy one:
Whoever is in on more tackles in a
game is treated to dinner by the
loser. Scanning the team’s nine-
game statistics, one finds that
Green’s tackles number 75, a
distant third to Chesley’s 119.

“I haven’t lost /every - game,”
Green says, “but Al’s been in my

he is often alternated by Sherrill
with Dave DiCiccio, Ricky Jackson
and Steve Fedell at end to provide
rest among the foursome. “That’s
something I complain about.”

And Sherrill adds another reason.
“Hugh takes all the blockers away
from Al,” explains the Panther
coach, noting Chesley’s position at
right linebacker.

Green’s worth to the defensive
unit, according to Sherrill, is
precious. “Hugh Green probably
could play any position on the
field,” he says. “He does now. He
plays end, tackle, and sometimes
we drop him back to linebacker.”

Right now, though, everybody“ A

seems content with Green playing

the end. As a freshman last year, he
made 88 tackles, including 12

quarterback sacks, and grabbed an

interception on his way to six
post-season honors.

,“I’m more experienced now,”

says Green, comparing last season
to this. ‘ ‘And'last year I played next
