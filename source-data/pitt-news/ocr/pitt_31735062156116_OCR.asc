By CLARK SUTTON
Pandemonium broke loose
here Monday as thousands of
wildly cheeringstudents cele-
brated the 22-19 win over
Notre Dame. Officially, the rally
was scheduled for 10:30 a.m. but
there was no controlling the crowd.
As early as 8230 a.m. students
began touring the classrooms and
exhorting others to “make the
break.” Pounding on trays “bor-
rowed” from the Tuck Shops, the
organizers were so successful in
breaking up classes that by 10 a.m.
the Commons Room was jammed.

Rally Finally Starts

At 10:30 a.m. the rally officially
got under way after a false start
on the Cathedral lawn. Red Daw-
son, Chancellor Fitzgerald, Mayor
Lawrence, the team andlcheer-
leaders succeeded in bringingathe
celebrants to their emotional peak,

,and the crowd soon spilled out of

the Commons Room on its way to
Tech.

On the way over, to the chant
of “Poor Irish” the mob celebrated
by breaking a window in a street
car, halting traffic on Forbes and
turning in a false alarm which
brought ﬁve ﬁre trucks speeding
to the Cathedral.

Panty Party Developes

At Tech they wildly cheered,
turned over lockers and broke a
window. From Tech, the group
moved on to PCW, where the dor-
mitqrieswere raided and looted of
women’s clothes, reminiscent of
last year’s celebrated

ly pleased over the victory and the
‘student enthusiasm: it generated.
Needed For Long Time
“We’ve needed this for a long
time,” he said, “this enthusiasm
augers well for the future, it’s
what makes a school great.”
Dean Biddle, while happy over
the Panthers’ upset of Notre Dame,

was celebrated.

“I feel very strongly,” he said,
“that we should celebrate our vic-
tories on our own property, and
not at the expense of neighboring
institutions.”

Biddle Disappointed

The clean said he had sponsored
the motion before the board of
deans to allow third hour classes
out for a victory rally, he said, in
thelhope that the students would
stay on campus, and was disap-,
pointed when they didn’t.

' “I believe in playing football on
Saturday and going to school on
Monday,” he concluded.

Dean Biddle said he had re-
ceived several complaints from
Fifth Avenue business houses con-
cerning property carted oﬁ by the
reveling students.

He instructed Paul Sherwood
Assistant to the dean of men, to set
up a collection center for the re-
turn of the appropriated goods.

Mr. Sherwood said that students

No Guests In Student
Section, Says Hamilton

3 By TIM KOVAR
Athletic Director Tom Hamilton, staunchly defending

school spirit to the last, rejected the

proposal to admit guests

to the student section at football games. _
Captain Hamilton made one concession, however; he said

that he would permit the wives¢

and husbands of students to enter
the student section for a fee of
$.50 if the dean of men’s ofﬁce
could develope a method to prove
that a person accompanying a stu-
dent was his or her wife or bus-
band.
' Give Up Right
Defending his position by say-
ing that students would be giving

up a right and a privilege by al- ,

lowing outsiders to inﬁltrate into
the student section, Hamilton
stated that there could be no pos-

-sible control over such a proposal.

Hamilton evidently feared that
if students were permitted to bring
a guest to a game, they would soon
abuse the privilege and sell the
guest tickets to people who would
ordinarily pay $3.50 for a ticket.

Cut Own Throats

Since the money derived from
the sale of tickets goes back into
athletic fund, Hamilton expressed
the opinion that students would
thus be cutting their own throats
by selling the reduced tickets to

.. people who would ordinarily pay

the full price.

Full Time Enrollment Drops
9% ; Part Time F igures Rise

Pitt’s_tota1 full time enrollment has dropped nine per-

cent, University Registrar J. G. Quick announced today. .
0  The ﬁgures to date are incomplete as certain groups are

not yet registered.

As of Oct. 1, 1952 the number of
registered full time undergradu-
ate students totals 4971; last year’s
total at this time was 5545, a de-
crease of 574.’ -

This year’s full time graduate
students total 414; last year’s fig-
ure was 482. g

Total full time students includ-
undergraduates, graduates,
J 0 h n s t o W n and professional
schools represent. a decrease of
682, from 7810 to 7128.

Undergraduate ‘part time stu-
dentstotal 1979, a decrease of 30

‘or two percent under last year’s

ﬁgure. Part time graduate stu-
dents numbering 2960 this year,
show an increase of 225 over last
year’s ﬁgure. (

Non degree students total 2681,
‘an increase over" last year’s ﬁg-

ure_of 2600.

' Total University part time ﬁg-
! ures show an increase of four per-
' cent with aitotal of 7786 as com-
pared to 7494 1st year. ~

Mr. Quick thought that there
were certain accounting inﬂuences
on the enrollment drop: (1) ab-
sence of largenumbers of full-
time veterans, many of whom
have been graduated in recent
years;; (2) effect of selective serv-
ice on .male students; (3) abnor-

smaller beginning classes of the
past two or three years due to the
‘lower birth rate of the depression
years. ‘ " ’
It is possible however that the
trend of smaller
turned; this year’s freshman class
is larger by 143 students than the
-class which began Sept., 1951.

Hurt Themselves

Actually, the sponsors proba-

bly did themselves more harm.

than good by beaming the Spar-
tans-Aggies game our way. For
the most part, the viewers be-
lieve that it is the sponsor who

" decides who shall see'what game,

and .when they are cheated out of

'_ something like Saturday’s classic,
they take it out on the_sponsor.

The guilt lies, however, with
the NCAA which has set up an
arbitrary schedule of games
which can be televised" and
where they can be televised. ‘It
is a take it or leave it program,
and most stations takezit.

Behind this action is the
commendable purpose of making
sure the stadium is ﬁlled and
that TV doesn’t cut‘ in on the

dent would be a picture of the

‘ person taken when the ticket was

sold. The prohibitive cost of such

a -method makes it_ impossible. A

Hamilton predicted that if grant-

"edthe privilege of bringing vis-

itors, students would ,abuse the
right, sell their tickets to persons
who would ordinarily pay the full
price foradmission, or else bring
in so ‘many non-Pitt‘ people "that
the section would become merely
another section in the stadium
and defeat the original purpose
ofseating the students together.

Selling the reduced price tick-
ets to outsiders would be like
cutting our own throats,‘ Hamil-
ton stated, since the ticket money
.goes back into the athletic pro-
gram fund,

In spite of these arguments
against the project, there are still
several vital points to be con-
sidered before '-«the proposal can
be rejected completely.

Not All Use Idea A,

Not every student is going to
bring a guest. The privilege
could be extended for one or two

-of the home games only; ‘games

when a capacity crowd is not.ex—
pected. Students from other col-
leges visiting Pitt students could

‘ hold‘ corruption and communism
..to be ‘fthe issues,” but are not

far-sighted enough to compare

that of big business concentra-
tion and weakening of the eco-
nomic strength, of labor and

farmers‘ and salaried‘ people ev-_ ~

erywhere.

gate receipts, sorely needed to
pay off the bond holders of ‘the
stadium.

Trouble Certain

But whenever any group de-
cides for the public what they
shall and shall not see, trouble
is bound to happen. Not a week

goes by that somebody isn’t mad '‘

because old Siwash ‘isn’t on TV,
and here in Pittsburgh every-

body gets mad at the sponsor "

and the ‘TV station.‘

The complexities of the prob-
lem are. great," and‘ it is not for.
us to say that Pitt’s games should
always be televised. I, for one,

don’t know the ticklish problems I

that have to'be met. _
P But it does seem like a down-
right shame that Pittsburgh
didn’t get to see the Panthers
break the backs of Notre Dame.

In fact, it was a_ crime. _

in

show their identiﬁcation '._cards ,

from their school when, purchas-
ing a guest ticket. Tickets could

‘be sold only at the gate with

both the Pitt student and his
guest present. ‘Other. schools,
such as Iowa, have satisfactorily
set up similar arrangements.
Contact with oﬁicials at such
schools might aid the project
here. ‘

Lastly, students who ordinarily_
do not attend the game or who
do not sit in the student section
because they would rather be

with .a friend of. the opposite sex, ed
‘ might take a new interest in the

home games and revive the sag-
ging school spirit thatonly re-
cently bounced back‘ when ’ we
beat the Iirish. _' , ‘
Action Wanted '

We, would like to -see these
points either" refuted or accepted.
We would also like to learn “the.
students’ reaction to this propo-
sal. ' Many have approved the
idea, but few have bothered-to
express their thoughts_in -writ-

ing or offer. any concrete s1_1gges- «H

Harriers Vie for Tenth

In Home Finale Today

By DAVE MAZER F’ .
Looking for their tenth consecutive win. the Pitt harriers
race for the last time "at Schenley Park today at 4 p.m.
when they face Slippery Rock Teachers.

Last Saturday, Ohio State

became the third 1952 victim

of the .’Blue-and—Gold runners when they returned home

With a 16-47 defeat.

Bernie Luterancik, rapidly approaching his championship.

formbf last year, again led Coache

Carl Olson’s harriers across the
tape. '
’ OSU Take Fifth

He was closely pressed by Buck-
eye star Bob Coldren at the half-
way mark but Luterancik put on
one of his typical ﬁnishes to win
in the fastest time of the season,
22:58.7. _ -

Dick Weber, Don Delli Gatti,
and Dan Sommer then showed the
strength“of_the Pitt squad as they
all ﬁnished strong to come in ahead
of Coldren. ~

However, the Ohioan did garner
a ﬁfth place to avert a shutout for
the OSU men while Don Doyle
and Ron Sallade ‘with sixth and
seventh places," respectively, com-
pleted the scoring.

V Weber with 23:18, Delli Gatti
with 23:23, and Sommer with 23:33
had their best races of the season
and are constantly moving to-
wards their top times.

' Joe ‘Schmidt Acts  
Like All-American‘

By BORIS WEINSTEIN

 

‘teammates could go all the

Sports ‘Editor

    

Joe Schmidt gently combed his blond hair‘ to the right,
shook clear a few drops of water that had ‘remained after
an almost thorough turkish towel rub and boldly announced:
“We’re ' going all the way this time——nothing can stop us.”

Captain Joe, of course, had good reason to think that his .
way in their remaining six

games. After all, they had» out-
charged and outscored the Irish at
Notre Dame that afternoon. '
The offense was steady, again,
and the defense, still without
depth, had been just as blood-
thirsty as the Irish. _ ,
_ Schmidt came out of the
battle with a slight head in-
jury that sidelined’ the blond
husky for the ﬁnal ten min-
utes. In my opinion, he also
‘survived the tilt as an All-
AAmerican performer, who
should lie among the top
candidates on everybody’s
dream team. , . i
V For two years now, Schmidt
has received praise every place
he has played. But his press clip-
pings, few as they are,Vha,ve only
impressed’ opposing coaches and"
players.— ‘

At "South Bend, for example, one prominent Indiana _sports

writer "labeled him, “as one of the greatest linebackers he has ever
seen.’,’ C l C ,

‘How much weight this and other complimentaries carry remains
to be seen. ‘But regardless, without exception, he is the key to the Pan-

ther defense and if he can shake off injuries that have plagued him "

for three years, Schmidt may lead the Panthers to their most suc-
cessful season since 1937.

John Michelosen, defensive coach,‘ commented that Schmidt hits
as hard as All-Pro'Lineback‘\er Jerry Shipkey of the Steelers.

Publicity from Pitt, though, has been too sparce in compari-
son to whatother college gridders receive from__ their alma, maters.
_VVVU’s-End Paul Bischoff, forexample, hailed as an All-American
prospect for two years, has yet to catch his ﬁrsttouchdown pass
of the year. But still he’s a candidate. ' A

Maybe if Schmidt duplicates his long run of last Saturday

after intercepting a short pass, he will attain-"some of that national

recognition-—if not as a linebacker, then as a runner.
