Kenneth M._Gou1d, ’16, writes the
secretary that he is still in the great
and wicked city of New York Zind has
not ‘departed for military camp at
Ya-phank, or elsewhere, as yet. He
says: ' ' -

It isn't my fault that the draft works
slowly and that things don't always hap-
pen‘ as per schedule. I have been just
on the edge between the first and second
drafts; but my board did not have to
call on me for the last 10 per cent, be-
cause enough men had already been
credited to it. . ’

I am applying for entrance to‘ the
psychological training course at Fort
Oglethrope, Ga., and hope to get down
there soon in company with George
Baii-d,, Captain Basset and other good
Pitt folks. If this fails and I cannot
get into some other special branch there
is nothing to do but wait for the next
draft, and the Lord only knows when
that will be.

PLEBES DOWNED
BY FRESHMEN

To put a ﬁtting climax to‘ a very
I season, the Freshmen

defeated ‘the Tech
Plebes in rather easy fashion on the
Tartans’ own ﬂoor? Theilads from
across the hollow offered a game
ﬁght,'but at no. stage of the game
were they able to;cope with the
whirlwind attack of _'tl'1e' Gold and
Blue. Kelly and Ross, the Pitt for-
wards, absolutely unbeatable

successful

were
and succeeded in ringing up '14 ﬁeld
goals between them. 'Kelly’s per-
formance was in keeping with his
work duringgthe whole season. His
offering consisted of 9 field goals and
16 out ‘-of 20 fouls. Beside helping
Breman to guard the’ Pitt basket,
Masley found time -toiease his way
through the Tech defense ‘with 4
ﬁeld goals. Johnny McCrory playgd
a ﬁne floor game and scored one ﬁeld
goal. _ . P
The Plaid fought gamely all the
way, but_- the going was simply too
fast for them. Pitt had the ball in
its possession so much of -the time
that Tech had no chances for exten-
sive scoring. Two of their men, ‘Rib-_
lat and Lynn, did the lion's share of
the scoring with 3 markers apiece.
This game completed the schedule
for the Yearlings. The season's rec-
ord is remarkable, showing victories
against only one defeat. Score: ’

the hillside boys last Friday evening
at the Tech gyrn_ 39-37.‘ Thisidefeat
came as a surprise to the Pitt fol-
10W.e1‘.5, as it was expected that Tech
would be rather easy picking after the
losses that ﬁve has suffered this
3935011. However the Skibos saw
that they had a chance to get back
at the Pitt bunch after many years
Of defeats after defeats and they
made the most of it. i '

Doherty Played 3 great game

against the Pittites and was the main-‘

stay of the team. Besides his accur- “ .. -
ate roul shooting, he -put up, a pretty ~ '

all-round passing game.. Levine was
the big scorer ‘for Pitt ‘from the ﬂoor,

caging ﬁve baskets.‘ It Wag,,«h,'5 3?,  ,

that brought Pitt up to the tie. Pen-

Of goals .as" the Tech star, Robinson  
went through the game withoutga 
goal, which is a ‘rare thing for him.

Had he been able to come through
the. score might have been just a few»
points in Pitt’s favor.

The‘ Phis Cams won «their ’ fourth
consecutive game when they. trimmed ’
the Sigma Epsilonsiby thepscorelof
26-20. The engineers were picked to'
give the Phi Gams all‘ kinds"of_.t_rou-_
ble, but Capt. Seidle’s boys were too
much for them and wonwby. a fair
margin. Massingham’s foul ‘shooting
was the principal feature of their vic- ii
tory. Theigame was fast and excit-
ing and close throughout, although ‘
the Phi Gams were ahead all the way."
For some reason the engineers did
not play up to their usual form, and
this, coupled with. the fact« that
Thomas was off color in foul shoot- .
ing, was sufficient to cause their 
downfall. "5
