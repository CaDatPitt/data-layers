‘High Tor’

Pitt Players will present the sec-

comedy, this evening in Foster me-

Pitt Players threw, themselves
over the footlights at their audi-
ence Wednesday evening, and——by
th.e rock-bound ghost of Henry
Hu.dson—the audience caught them
and held them for an unprecedent-
ed ovation. ’

Presenting Maxwell Anderson’s
“High Tor,” a tale concerning a

‘young man trying to keep his an-

cestral mountain from being cut
down by his semilegal real estate
dealers, the Players coupled the
author’s Elizabethan-RipVanWink—
lish contrast of melodrama, farce,
and delicate love scenes with a ma-
ture cast. They provided an ex-
cellent evening’s entertainment.
Although, ., the Critics’ circle
awardee was billed as a comedy,
acting honors went to Hulda Tully
as Lise, the ghostwife of one of
Hudson’s captains, lost, with the
crew, on the'Tor. Miss Tully took
these honors for the manner in
which she held the audience’s in-
terest throughout some of the most

blank cartridge pistol’ went off un-

It seems that someone switched

By Student Opinion Surveys

AUSTIN, Tex., Dec. 12—Al-
though still more optimistic
about the United States staying
out of war than the general pub-
lic is, American college students
have lost some conﬁdence during
the last 12 months that we can avoid

' the conﬂict.

of national
today expressed

This is the tenor
campus opinion

through the cross-sectional samp- .

lings of Student Opinion Surveys of
America. The Pitt News is one of
the 150 college newspapers cooper-
ating in conducting these scientiﬁc
polls.
Defense Expansion V

The defense expa_nsion program
that this country is now witnessing
will be a factor in helping to keep
us out of the European conﬂagra—
tion, two out of every three colleg-
ians believe. Asked by Survey’s
‘interviewers whether they “felt the
enlargement of our army and navy
will help to keep us out of war. or
draw us closer to war,” these were
the answers given, in percentages:

Will help to keep us out. . . . .67%
‘Will draw us closer . . . . . . . ..33%

Exactly one year ago, in Decem-
ber, 1939, Student Opinion Surveys
sampled the college world with this
question: “Do you believe that the
United States can stay out of the
present war?” That was shortly
after the German invasion of P0-
land and the beginning of general
hostilities. The question has been
repeated, and this is the compar-
ison:

Believed we can keep out,
Dec., 1939 . . . . . . . . . .  . . .68%

Believed we can stay out,

'’Dec., 1940’ I . . . . . . . . . . . . . .".6!{%”' ‘

Cross—tabulations show that opin-
ion among college men and among
coeds.is identical.

The answers in the present poll
have been further broken down to
make possible a study of qualiﬁed
opinions. Of’ the 63 per cent who
believe the U. S. will not be includ-
ed 7 per cent attached an “if” to
their answers. Most of these qualiﬁ-
cations included the idea expressed
by a University of Vermont senior.
“Yes, we can stay out if Britain can
hold out long enough.”

Eliminate Spies

Another opinion prevalent among
students was exempliﬁed by the
comment made to the Georgia State
Teachers college interviewer, “Yes,
if the U. S. could get busy and
eliminate spies and ﬁfth column-
ists.” But there were many who
feel this nation has already taken
too many dangerous steps. “We’re
already in it, for we are ﬁghting
economically for England,” said a
St. Edward’s (Texas) university
sophomore.

College youth has better hopes
for the international future of the
country than does the average
American voter. The most recent
Gallup poll (November 30) on the
subject reveals that although op-
timism is growing, a majority of 59
per cent still feels the U. S. will
eventually have to ﬁght. College
sentiment has increased in the op-
posite direction, towards the pessi-
mistic side, but a majority remains
ﬁrm in the belief war will be
avoided.

Mobilization Day May Become
Reality in 60 Days, Says Baxter

M—day, the much-talked-about
day when industry and men will be
mobilized for defense, will likely
become a reality, according to Rob-
ert J . Baxter, instructor in econ-
omics.

“We have already partially mo-
bilized manpower,” said Mr. Bax-
ter. “Indications point to a mobil-
ization of industry in the next 60
days.”

The M—day plan is the scheme
devised by the War department,

will lead the Pitt Riﬂes Military

night at the Twentieth Century

The dance, a combined social af-

‘Lain.

Featuring the music of Owen Pie-
per and his band, the dance will

itary guests, in keeping with its
military theme.

based on the ﬁndings of Bernard
Baruch, Hugh Johnson, and others
in the last war. The effect of the
plan will be consolidation of pro-

duction for war materials at the
expense of so—called consumers
goods, Mr. Baxter stated. Accord-
ing to the plan all resources are
divided into three sections. Men,
materials, and money will be the
objects of mobilization.

“The machinery is all set up to
draft men. Originally it had been
planned to call into service more
men than have been drafted, but
the army administration found that
it could not handle them all. How-
ever, within a period of 30 days
the army can muster enough men
to reach any given strength,” Mr.
Baxter pointed out.

The mobilization of industry will
probably have repercussions, he
stated. At the present time indus-
try is operating on a cost—plus
basis. Under the plan, industry will
have to produce according to gov-
ernment plan at a proﬁt limit set
up by the government. Prices will
be ﬁxed.

“We will have to get along with
less automobiles and less refrig-
erators,” according to Mr. Baxter.
“We are going through much the
same thing that happened in Great
Britain.” The expense of all this
defense operation will probably be
met by increased borrowing.

“The program will undoubtedly
have its effects on college life,”-»Mr.
Baxter stated. “We"will s”ee'"a “de-
crease in liberal arts courses?‘ -and
an increase in'stud_ies and activi-
ties relatedsto defense.”

Dr. Bowman Accepts Eleventh
Nationality Room at Ceremony

Declaring that the newly—pre-
sented Italian room, “symbolic of
the Italy of history with its time-
less cultural contributions” was to
be a “mirror for yesterday and a
beacon light for tomorrow,” Rug-
gero Aldisert, C41, editor of the
Pitt News, chairman of the SFA
Italian room committee, spoke on
behalf of students of the Univer-
sity as the eleventh of the nation-
ality kooms was opened Monday.

The ceremony began with a pro-
cession of 300 students of Italian
extraction, joined by members of
SFA, which escorted Chancellor
John G. Bowman to the scene of
the presentation, the balcony im-
mediately in front the room.
Room Presented

The room was officially presented
to Dr. Bowman by Salvatore Sun-
seri, chairman of the Italian room
committee, who urged the teaching
of the Italian language in the room.
He said that the room was the crys-
tallization of 13 years of hard
work.” In presenting the key to
the room to Dr. Bowman, Mr. Sun-
seri declared that “It is the earnest
hope of the committee that this
room should be an inspiration to

all students to study the Italian
language.” -
Mr. Sunseri particularly lauded

the work of the women on the Ital-
ian room committee whose»wo.rk_,
he asserted, made itpossible to
raise the funds necessary to open
the room. A ~

Accepts Key _ . .

After Dr. Bowman, accepted the
key and opened the door rto-the
room, Father De Francesco, noted
Pittsburgh. Lt’.-‘.lian-American priest,
pronounced a blessing upon. the
newest of~t.he Uni-vers_ity’s nation-
ali~t_V~r_ooms.'— 3 '-  . V
spoken_ in the

new room were those written by Pe-
trarch, iamous Italian poet. They
were read by Ilario Tornese, C41,
president of the Italian club.

Following an inspection of the
room by members of the Italian
room committee, faculty members
of SFA, Mrs. Ruth Crawford Mitch-
ell, Dr. Bowman, Father De Fran-
cesco, Aldisert, and Albert Klim-
check, University architect who su-
pervised ﬁnal plans and construc-
tion of the room, Dr. Bowman made
a short speech of acceptance.

The chancellor extolled the cul-
tural values for which the Italian
room stands, declaring that Italian
students, as the largest non—English
speaking nationality group in the
University, “are equipped for posi-
tions of leadership in the commun-
ity with a cultural background vir-
tually unequalled by any other
group.”

Expresses Appreciation

Following Dr. Bowman, Aldisert
expressed appreciation to each of
the persons who played a part in
placing the Italian room on the list
of the University’s nationality
rooms. He said that “students
should derive an inspiration from
the names of men listed in the
Italian room—such men as Leonard
Da Vinci, Verdi. Michelangelo, Mar-

coni, all of whom lifted the world

outof’ the darkness of yesterday in-
to the dawn of today.” ,
“The Italian room committee has
done its part. It has given this
room to the , University; and’: it
new devolves, upon us, as‘. ‘custo-
dians of all thaitraditions of a 1:10-
ble institution," to make .t1:_11s room

Alhert Klimeheok,
Forgotten Man

Among those . present at last Wednesday’s
opening of the Italian room were many who
sdeserved and received recognition.

One man was there who hung behind the
speakers’ stand, one who received sparse atten-
tion. That man is Albert J. Klimcheck, Univer-
sity architect.

True, the room was designed by and con-
structed by others. But it was the hand of
Albert Klimcheck that united the individual
art-pieces that were the parts of the room and
‘placed them in harmony; his hand it was that
_made the room a part of the Cathedral, com-
patible with and complementary to the larger
" building. ‘

,‘;We Elave Not Yet

'i"Bl3gElll to Cram

 FURTHER PROOF that Pitt is on the Way
, to reaching the “high academic levels” of some
“of the snootier Eastern schools is revealed by
_the December issue of the American Mercury,
I‘ which has an article on “College Tutoring
 Racket.” It seems that Pitt has no official “cram

:”parloi*s,” which, by the use of bootlegged tutor-

wing notes, cram sessions, etc., guarantee to get
scholars through their courses.

 This “capsule education” is in evidence espe-
cially on the ivy league campuses, where an

S’ estimated 50 to 75 per cent of the undergradu-

ﬂates use highly educational devices of plagiarized
. translations, prepared outlines, and advance in-

formation on bluebooks.
It might interest some of these eastern purity
«schools to learn that we at much-censured Pitt
are gradually catching on to the “modern meth-
ods of education,” for “one paper . . Written
at Harvard, toured the New England colleges,
turned upat Princeton and Columbia, and was
last seen at the University of Pittsburg (sic) .”
Well, that’s a,st_art in theright direction, but
until Phi Eta Sigma or some other group adopts

 New Technique, Pitt Will have to remain in

--the primordial-. ooze of -ethical education. >l

The gitt News

The American Empi1°e:

For the last couple of years, Pitt students have been
listening to the idealistic plans of their prbfessors
advocating an American Empire. 1

At the last Town Meeting this interesting subject
was broached.

In order to solve our economic problems—-unemploy-
ment, restricted markets, an unexpanding economy
—an empire has been suggested. '

Now is the time for empire building, the advocates
say. We are in a period of change, transition, and
revolution. If the right amounts of intelligence and
force combine, an empire can be built.

To understand the proposed empire, reference to
several main concepts must be made. These con-
cepts are totalitarianism, capitalist expansion, and
what constitutes an empire.

To build an empire in this hard, cruel world———or
so it seems to those who are not strict relativists-—
we Empire Builders must be hard, cruel people. We
will have to kill many people, put many dissenters in
concentration camps, starve many of them, and drive
some of them crazy.‘

We could perhaps do it an easier way, but you
see, we must compete with the fascists for the control.
of parts of the world. Since their political and economic
system is more efficient than ours in certain respects,
we, as competitors, will have to adoptrwhat we can
of their systems. Of course our totalitarianism, or
fascism, or what you will, cannot be like theirs. Ours
will be only relative. Perhaps we will call it Relative
Totalitarianism.

An Essay In Smoke

The smoke may hide much down in the Tuck shop
but there are some things that can't always be screened.
The TPA’s, for instance hold down one corner in re-
lays. Alice Lally, Betty Jane Kim, Mary Zarman and
Julie DeLeo being the rotators. And, of course, the
Kappas never let the seats get cold. Tony Nesbitt,
Sue Rigby, Kitty Lou Haughton and Nancy Sundstrom
don’t have any one man in common but they manage to

attract their share. Glamor Pants Lewis can always

be seen entertaining some one, this time Gene Pyle
and Beth Hughes. One of the strangest sights, and
it would have to be weird to be strange in that place,
was Joe Roberts in a swinging mood studying music-—
of all the things to study.

Thelma Jacobs and Bob Davis, two little cuties,
seemed to be unconscious of all the bustle. They
were that way at the frosh dance last week, too. Oh,
well, love is like that. Speaking of the dance, there
was a bit of smoke there, too. Jack Nesbit made a
dramatic appearance with Peg Johnston. Everything
was hazy to poor Jack.

Claire Cornwall was the damper to a strictly dry
night for Dick Harman. And those jitterbugs who at-
tempted to burn up the ﬂoor could take an easy lesson
on how to take up floor space without the gymnastics.
Joe Mash and Marsh Morgan practice their steps on
the eighth floor, and the seismograph registers an
earthquake.

Retreat From Moscow

But back to the Tuck shop; there is so much there.
Sully Loeb is usually smiling all over the place. He
is the boy who scored so high on that machine that
registers the dippiness of the dream box. Owly Bill
Sheris saddle shoes his way to the smokehouse to
check on you, and you. . .. . Sammy Camarata is
always pulling a gag but steers clear from Nancy
Sundstrom who goes him one better. Petie Allan wants
a show with a strictly male cast and gets it. Joe Deily
was ﬁrst man but Grey Weller did the followup. For
the next show we nominate Lois Galbreath for the
business and publicity chairman.

Bill Jones, theman with the head bandage, is out
with Marj Winters so now he sits with Betty K.
Dobbins. Seems as though that blond was with Joe
Roberts last Saturday night at the Playhouse. The
Playhouse—-there is a blue haze there, too. It supports
its share of Pittites, Betty Sapp and her ﬂame were
there. We thought that Clippinger had gone west. ’

Spending Cuts Should Be Discriminating

0 By Francis D. Tyson 0

Recently Dean Charles S. Tip-
petts sent a pertinent statement to
the News, pointing to the danger of
continued general public spending
in the light of the expanded de-
fense appropriations. Certainly it
is true that when we have expand-
ed our productive facilities to the
full, and make all practicable tech-
nical and managerial innovations,
(some observers believe we may
raise our annual national income
from 70 billions toward 100 billions)
the menace of inﬂation related to
unwise credit and price policies will
be a real one. And we must tax
as well as borrow.

But there is some reason for op-
timism. Secretary Morgentliau
wishes to use long term borrowing
not based on bank money—an anti-
inﬂation policy. Chairman Dough-
ton of the House ways and means
committee has already announced
the purpose of Congress to balance
the regular budget, at last, by pass-
ing new tax measures. Lowering
the income tax exemption, a pro-
gressive measure, is being seriously
discussed for the ﬁrst time.

0 Differs with Bus A-d Dean

May I differ with Dean Tippetts
in his emphasis on the general need
to cut public spending‘? Such a pro-
gram must be related to the pro-
gram of eﬁective defense; and that
is a matter for expert opinion and
full review of public policy. Now
it happens that the two ﬁelds in
which the dean recommends cur-

tailed expenditure, housing ‘ and
highway construction, have been
rather intensively studied. Any

programs in these ﬁelds calling for
enhanced, not reduced expenditure,
and recommended as basic to de-
fense, will be presented to the new
Congress.

The Twentieth Century Fund has
just issued a -careful volume—-
“Housing for Defense”—-calling for
stimulation of private construction
and cooperative public effort.

0 Expanded Housing Needed

The Federal Works Authority,
under John M. Carmody, former
industrialist, well known in Pitts-
burgh, has been allocated an initial
sum of 150 millions, and a coordin-
ator of housing, Mr. Palmer, to work
with USHA and FHA, has been
busy for some months past. The
problem is being stressed in the
well organized. staff work of the
defense council. There seems to be
agreement that an expanded, not a
curtailed, housing program is a
fundamental consideration in na-
tional defense, and for renewed
prosperity and well-being.

Even more obvious is the defense
need for an improved national high-
way program. Pittsburghers, in-
ured to the Wilkinsburg approach
and West End outlet, do not need
to be propagandized to that end.
The superhighway to Harrisburg has
“sold” itself.

0 Super Highways for Defense

Here again the defense program
is pretty well prepared; as recent
dispatches from Washington point
out, an important item of the new
budget to be submitted to Congress
in January is a system of superhigh-
ways linking key industrial centers.
The plan calls for what will proba-
bly be the greatest road building
program in the history of the coun-
try. Elimination of transportation
bottlenecks such as prevailed dur-
ing World War I and since, is one
economy goal; also, the problem of
conﬂicting state highway . laws,
which are a serious impediment to
transport and so to defense, is being

inet. Here, inevitably, the govern-
ment must strengthen its leadership
in the national interest.

Would it not be wiser to contract
non-essential expenditures, far from
basic needs such as better roads
and houses, and a greatly expanded
public health program which is a
basic economy long overdue, and al-
so recently agreed upon by the cab-
inet? ,

0 Points Way to Economy

May I suggest the vital importance
of elimination of’ wastes—for in-
stance, in advertising stimulation of
emulative, luxurious consumer ex-
penditures? Is this not a time for
revival of the old American virtue
of thrift? There is in this crisis,
again, no need for the speculative
activities in the stock market and
elsewhere that contributed so large-
ly to monetary and price inﬂation
in the ﬁrst World War. And we
ought even to learn—with possible
artistic and moral gains--to get on
with our great tasks without cos-
metics and jewelry, silk stockings,
style gyrations, half-baked propa-
ganda, and poor food. But I need
not burden you with these sugges-

Socialitems . . -

Biggest social event of the week-
end seems to be the Kappa Sigma-
Chi Omega dance tonight at the
Churchill Valley country club. This
Christmas formal will carry out the
brother—sister theme with half the
favors adorned with the Chi 0 seal
and the other half with the Kappa
Sig seal. Bob Stattlemeyer and his
orchestra will provide the music.

The Phi Mus are dashing around
like mad this week trying to get
themselves and their apartment in
top shape before today. The reason
for all the fuss is the coming of their
district president, Floretta Mane-
val, who will spend the weekend
inspecting the chapter
Delta Zetas are going in for Christ-
mas in a big way. Monday night
will ﬁnd a ten cent grab bag party
and Thursday night a Yuletide
dance in honor of their new pledges.

Those lucky Phi Delta Theta
boys are being entertained by their
mothers tonight at a Christmas
party. The main thing of the eve-
ning will be, of course, the ex-
change of presents . . The Phi
Gamma Deltas are doing their
Christmas up in a big way, too. To-
morrow evening they will hold a
dance that has been planned by the
pledges. The music will be furnish-
ed by Rusty Williams and his or-

do their good deed ;tor the day by

Americanism
And Small Arms

Editor, The Pitt News:

I feel it my duty as an American
to answer Harvey Lincoff’s letter in
which he speaks of something of
which he obviously knows nothing.

It is clear that Mr. Lincoff is one
of those tender young men whom
we often hear say, “I would rather
die than shoot a man.” Lincoﬁ
seems to think that just because
some tough guy has a gun resting
on his victim's middle that the vic-
tim, gunor no gun, hasn’t a chance.

Use your common sense, Harvey.
,A man wholpacks a gun generally
.. knows, how to use it. Take Hamil-

ton and mefor instance. We can

.,,-draw a pistol and put two shots in

the targetbefore a half dollar drop-
ped from shoulder height can hit
the A ground.

. What’s more, so can any man who

. shoots on our National Riﬂe asso-

ciation ranges. It’s part of the
course in quick draw. Couple this

.with a little deceptive feinting and

then say that we
chance.

Of course you’ll say that your
hypothetical little bookkeeper can’t
do this, but that’s just the point.

.He could if he had a gun and

would learn how to use it. For that
matter, his wife and daughters
could too. And he may be willing
to shoot at a man, not because of
the paltry cash, but for what it
means to him and his family in food,
clothing, and so on.

Another thing, Harvey, a quick
draw artist is not a killer, he is a
wise man. Give a man a gun, teach
him how to use it and then see if
some guy (Hitler for instance)
pushes him around.

Harvey, you are of a certain
breed. The breed of city dwellers.
Why try to decide whether or not
a man is wrong if he wants to meet
some gun—toter on an equal footing?

Harvey, guns made this country

Flowers are blooming in the Sta-

ball horticulturalist Doctor H. C.
Carlson sends his fast-passing senior
ﬁve through ﬁnal tuneup drills for
the Midwest invasion which starts
next Wednesday night.

The much publicized “Blooming
Flower” offense, which some have
chosen to call the “Busy Bee,” is
just the new label Doctor Carlson
has tagged onto the 1940 variation
of the figure eight. “We’re driving
more men into the basket than
we ever did before,” says the Doc-
‘tor, “but there’s nothing radically
‘new about the system.”

System Like Botany

forward to a record‘ number of
candidates before the ﬁrst semester.

The Panther coaching staff has
long pointed with pride to the great
number of star track athletes de-
veloped here who never donned
spiked footgear in high school. In-
cluded in this group was Al Fer-
rara, one of the greatest runners in
Pitt history who came to Pitt to
play basketball.

Al came out for freshman track
for his initial experience in the
sport competitively and made the
freshman mile relay team which
won the title at the Penn Relays.
From that time on he was a mem-
ber of every Pitt mile relay team
that ever won any collegiate title.
He probably ran on at least twenty-
ﬁve championship foursomes.

And‘ Ripp Still Likes Professional Football

By Jerry Kipp

The annual debate as to the r1;l—
ative merits of professional football
and college football is on once
again. Both sides have their good
points, but it is the opinion of this
scribe that the rough, and tough
brand of ball played’ by the pros
is the best.

Those of you who like football
for football alone will readily agree
that the pro style of play is better
becauseof the more concentrated
action. It is more spectacular‘ and
much more thrilling. It is not un-
common to see a team with the ball
in the shadow of its own goal line
pass and have that pass ‘turned into
a touchdown. Also, time ‘after time
a‘ man‘ is tackled and scrambles to
"his feet and goes -another 10 ‘or 20

yards.  it  '* 

-If you are one of those persons
who ‘goes to a football game for the

you. Footballis played, however,
for the glory of winning or losing
in a sportsmanlike manner and not
to see who has the best swing band
in the country or which demonstra-
tions block can form the best ﬂag
or panther. (Attention Southern
Methodist and Betty Sapp.) ‘

The point has been raised by
those favoring college ball that
each Saturday thousands of young
men go out on the. gridirons of
America “to do or die Jor dear old
Rutgers.” ,Human nature being
what it is, it would seem that the
incentive “to do or die for dear old
paycheck” is even greater. When
your bread and butter, and the
bread and butter, of a wife and
family, in many cases, depends on
“doing the dieing” you are bound
to ﬁght harder and put more into
your play than if only for an, -all-

in a charity game or an exhibition
match, the pro team wins. This
should convince any die-hard col-
lege fan that the style of play em-
ployed by the “play for pay” boys
is better.

If you want to listen to a good
swing band, listen to Glen Miller or
Jan Savitt on your radio or re-
cording machine. But for a real
football game that will keep you
on the edge of your seat for sixty
minutes and give you a thrill dur-
ing every play, go to a professional
football game. After the ﬁrst quar-
ter you too will sing the praises
of the men who “do or die for dear

Louis C. Schroeder, director of
the Pittsburgh bureau of recreation
and general chairman, has planned
a general theme of “Preparedness”
for the convention. Dr. Elizabeth
Rearick, professor of physical edu-
cation, has aided Dr. Davis in ar-
ranging the program.

Dental Alumni Present
Portrait to Dr. Friesell

Wells Honored
For Discovery

Of Anesthesia

By Frank Mastoraki

Ninety-sixth anniversary of the
discovery of anesthesia was com-
memorated last Tuesday by the
presentation in the old Mellon In-
stitute building of a portrait of Dr.
Horace Wells, inventor of anesthe-
sia, to Dr. H. E. Friesell, dean f
the School of Dntistry.

The presentation was made by Dr.
W. Harry Archer, president of the
Dental Alumni association, which
sponsored the painting. The por-
trait of Dr. Wells was painted by a
Pittsburgh artist, Verona Kiralfy,
who at present is associated with
the Pennsylvania Art project.

Dr. Friesell made the acceptance
speech, followed by other addresses
by Dr. George J. Thomas, professor
of anethesia in the School of Medi-
cine, and by Matilda Margison, pres-
ident of the University Nurses
Anesthetists association.

Conceives Idea.

Ninety-six years ago, Dr. Wells,
a young dentist in Hartford, Conn.,
conceived the idea of inhalation
anesthesia to eliminate the screams
of patients undergoing surgical op-
erations.

“Dr. Wells today is an inspiration
to every dentist and a source of
pride to’ his profession. He set an
example of what a person who is in-
tensely interested in his work can
accomplish,” stated Dr. Friesel in
eu1ogi,z1n__g,,,. Dr. Wells. V “Regional,
partisan claims for others are of
little meaning when one studies the
actual work of Horace Wells and

V-iwhat has sprung from it-'———.all: the
‘I wiondersof modern methods in gen-

eralland local anesthesia inltheir
various ' forms”;
Interest Stimulated

F01-ty-tvvo years ago, while a dent-
al student, Dean Friesell’s interest
in anesthesia was stimulated by his
meeting with Gardner Q. Colton,
the chemist who gave a demonstra-

' tion of nitrous oxide at which the

idea of anesthesia came to Dr.
Wells’ mind. For the past 44 years,
Dr. Friesell has 4 been collecting
everything he could obtain on the
. history of anesthesia as well as cur-
rent books on the subject. The
University dental library collection
of literature on anesthesia ranks
‘ among the best in the nation.

The Dental Alumni association,
desiring to give tangible evidence
of its appreciation of Dr. Freisell’s
work in collecting this material and
making it available for its mem-
bers, selected this aﬁair to present
him with this portrait.

Daer Issues Call

Payment of pledges to the Com-
munity fund was urged today by
Harry E. Daer, assistant bursar of

Coke-Smoke

Engineers Get Coke
Dispensers, Lounges

Automatic coke dispensing ma-
chines and a smoking lounge for
students in the School of Engi-
neering and Mines are prime ob-
jectives of the Engineering asso-
ciation at present, Paul Papanek,
E41, president, announced at a cab-
inet meeting of the group Wednes-
day.

“Since we have no Tuck shops or
smoking rooms in State hall or
Thaw hall, engineers feel there is
a need for these,” Papanek said.
Association members have suggest-
ed Heinz house for possible use as
a smoking lounge.

The cabinet, composed of repre-
sentatives from each of the Engi-
neering and Mines seminars and
the engineering fraternities, pro-
poses to install a Coca-Cola dispen-
ser in Thaw hall and one in State
hall. The machine is automatic.
When a nickel is inserted, it re-
leases a cup ﬁlled with ‘the ice cold
drink.

Money earned on the machine
will be used for furthering the
of the
engineering and mines students.

Test-Scorers Earn Respite as University Uses
Automatic Machine for Objective Examinations

By Neal Russo

Students in political science, so-
ciology, psychology, and several
other courses who don’t think their
examination papers were marked
correctly will have to blame it all
on a new steel-plate machine hid-
den in the corner of a room up on
the twenty-first ﬂoor.

For there stands the so-called
electric scoreograph that is being
used by the University this year for
the ﬁrst time to grade true-false and
multiple choice tests given by Pitt
professors.

A time saver and a guaranteed
grader, the machine is available to
any professor who gives true-false,
multiple choice, and other objective
examinations, announces Dr. Carroll
Whitmer, assistant professor of
psychology, who is in charge of the
test-grading arrangements. Those
interested are asked to make ar-
rangements in 2101 Cathedral with
Rose Pecora, secretary in the psy-
chology department, who handles
inquiry and test material.

‘ Standing about three feet high,
the super-adding machine resem-
bles a low desk. It isn’t completely
automatic though, as at least one
person must be on hand to “feed”

Evening Students

Will Sing Carols g

Each night next week students in
the evening classes will gather in
the Commons Room tosing Christ-
mas carols. Since class periods will

be altered for this event, all stu-
dents will be able to attend.
The custom of singing Yultide

1 carols was originated several years

ago when classes were held down-
town in the Chamber of Commerce
building. When classes were tans-
ferred to the Cathedral of Learning
this practice was continuedeach
year at Christmas-time.

On Monday, Wome-.n’s choral, di-
rected by Mrs. J. F. Lissfelt, will
lead the singing. Russell G. Wich-
mann, University organist, will be
accompanist. '

Edward B. 'Williams, director of
the Placementibureau for men, will
lead the singing Tuesday evening
with Mr. Wichmann again at the
organ. Theodore M; Finney, asso-
ciate professor of music apprecia-
tion, will direct the carol singing on
Wednesday night.

Editorial Board .  .

of the Pitt News will meet at 2:30
o’clock today in the office of the
editor.

A meeting of the entire editorial
staff will take place Monday at
3:30 o’clock.

Pitt knows how to operate the ma-
chine. She is Elizabeth Laschin-

ant in the psychology department.

Although Miss Laschinger has
been tangling with the machine only
a few months, she already has
Worked up an hourly speed of 150 to
200 papers, each with as many as
150 possible test items.

The electric machine has to be
kept heated because its scoring is
not too accurate when the inside
gadgets are not dry, Miss Laschin-
ger points out. Students must use
special lead pencils to mark their
answers on the specially-provided
test sheets. Purpose of these pen-I
cils is to have the carbon carry
through a large enough accumula--

. tion of current to enable thema-

chine to determine the rightness or
wrongness of each answer.

The machine is not very compli-
cated once the numerous levers are
set. After the levers are arranged
to have the papers marked for the
number of right answers, the num-
ber of right answers, or several
other combinations, Miss Laschin-

Student Medical Papers

The Students’ Medical society will

“Symptoms.” and “Treatments.”

 

    

 

slot, nudges another lever, and
presto—-the total score appears on
a speedometer-like indicator!

“Brains” of the machine comes in
the form of a set of electric brushes
that sends a ton of pressure through
a black plate which contains the
“key” answer combinations. So ac-
curate are all these little devices
that the machine, when it is in op-
eration, needs to be checked only
about once an hour to make certain
it isn’t out of order.

Although the University’s ma-
chine, in use since September, gives
only the total score, other scorec-
graphs that can break the total
score down into the various divisions
of the test are being perfected.
However, the Pitt machine can give
weighted scores on most types of
objective tests, true-false and mul-
tiple choice being the easiest to
handle.

Acid test for the electric scorer
was the set of over 1,100 psycholo-
gical examinations taken by fresh-
men upon entrance this fall.
