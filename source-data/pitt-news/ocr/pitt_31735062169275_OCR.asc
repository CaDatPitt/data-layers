UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

WPDU Hosts McGil1 College

For Parliamentary Debate

The William Pitt Debate Union

‘I (WPDU) hosted two students

from McGill College of Mon-.
treal last Wednesday for a par-
liamentary debate concerning
“Resolved: That the Democratic
Party Should Du-mp Johnson in
1968.” The proposal was defeat-
ed 11 to 9.

Steve Leightman teamed with
Canadian student Arthur His-
ter to support the Government
proposition while Mahmood
Mamdani with the other visi-
tor, Joel Kreps, opposed the Gov-
ernment stance. Both McGill stu-
dents are touring the East un-
der the auspicies of Montreal's
Expo 67.

Leightman opened the debate
for the Government by deﬁning
the basic goal of the Democratic
Party, the economic stability
and the well-being of the Amer-
ican people. He indicted John-
son for being “ugly” and behav-
ing like “an impulsive Texas
cowlboy who shoots little Viet-
namese Indians.” Leightman did,
however, sight as one of John-
son's accomplishments his keep-
ing America out of war with
Mexico, Canada, and Britain. He

supported the nomination of
Lurleen Wallace, the Governor
of Alabama, not only because
“Mrs. Wallace is prettier than
Johnson,” but also because Ala-'
—bama’s governor would bring
Democratic power back to the
South, its most loyal region.
Leightman cited that some of
Mrs. Wallace's aides would be
Strom Thurmond as Secretary
of State, Barry Goldwater as
Ambassador to the UN, and
George Lincoln Rockwell as Am-
bassador to Israel.

Mamdani countered by saying
that one of Johnson's greatest
contributions has beenhis“myth
generation.” Mamdani claimed
that in South Vietnam, LBJ‘
means “Little Baby Jesus.” He
further asserted that “the basic
institutions” our nation are at
fault, not President Johnson.

Closing for the Government,
Hister retorted that since the_
goal of every electoral party is
to win, and since Johnson will
lose in 1968, he should be scrap-
ped. Hister claimed that “John-
son does not make mistakes, he
is one." He further scored John-

" son for being a ‘“boor,” “ill-man-

Annoyed Students Want TO“ I‘

Petition Pitt Book Center

by LEWIS M. TAFFER

A group of students, dis-
satisfied with the situation
concerning the University's
bookstore, plan to circulate
among the student body and
faculty petitions advocating
certain changes.

A spokesman for the group,

“ ~ Gerald Rosen, stated the petition
" . advocates that ﬁve measures be

taken by the Administration.
First, the petition calls for the
public disclosure of the book
store's proﬁt-loss statements for
the last four‘ years. -
Second, the students ‘request-
ed that the book store begin the
sale, either directly or through

" catalogue, of items bearing the

University seal. Third, the peti-
tions request that the student
body be informed as to why
"certain paperback books are
soldlabove their list price."

In addition, a ten per cent dis-
count for University students
buying items in the book store
is advocated. The petition also
asks for an investigation that
would report to the student body
the "possibility of converting the
book store into a co-operative.

According to Rosen, students"
will be asked to meet Thursday
at 12:30 p.m. at the Schenley
Quadrangle entrance to the book
store. From there, the students
will proceed to the SU Ballroom
to the forum on student involve-

nered,” and “one of the ugliest
people in the United States.”

Kreps concluded the opposi-
tion’s case by claiming that
America has not shown “com-
passion” for its President. He
conceded that Johnson was ugly
and had a poor personality, but
this, he'"felt, was reason to treat
him sympathetically.

New Senate Projects  

The ﬁrst Student Government
(SG) Forum will be held tomor-

in the ﬁrst bill passed by the
newly-elected Senate.

The Forum will be in two

Albee Launches Attack

Playwright Edward Albee
launched an attack against the
current Broadway critics at
Monday noon’s Public Aﬁairs
lecture. Albee, who spoke to an

overﬂowing crowd in the SU ,
VBa11room, is’ the author of such

renowned works as Who's Afraid
of Virginia Woolf and Tiny Alice.
Albee chided the largely stu-

‘dent audience for joining the

ranks, ten years after they grad-
uate from school of the masses
-who clamor for Any Wednes-
day and The Sound of Music,
while as students they main-
tain a serious interest in qual-
ity production. He did stress
that university theaters were on
the whole on a much higher lev-
el’than regional theaters or the
Broadway stage. '

In Book Store

Senators Question

The Student Government
Committee on the University
Book Center met Thursday
with the head of Auxiliary
Enterprises John C. Lange-
staff and the newly-appoint-
ed manager of the Book Center,
Mary Bonach. Senators Bloom,
Greene, and Weiss questioned
certain Book Center policies
which they felt were not in the
student’s best interests. '

The ﬂrst question raised by
the committee was the practice
of putting Book Center price
tags over the printed price on
books and art supplies. Bonach
stated that these price tags rep-
resent increases in the manu-
facturers suggested retail prices
are not proﬁt mark-ups for the

‘Book Center. She insisted that

the prices in the University Book

Center are in some cases lower _

than other college book ' stores.
5“ A 1 §   139

   

with Princeton University and
Carnegie Tech.

The question of most vital
concern to the committee was
the necessity of an Add-Drop
slip for exchange of a text book.
The committee cited examples

-of cases in which a student had

justiﬁcation for returning atext
book without an Add-Drop slip
which is necessary for a refund.

One such instance might be that-

after a week or two of class, the
student realizes that certain re-
quired books are either purely
supplementary or repetitious of
a previous - course. Under the
present policy, this student has
to keep books he «does not want
or need because he has not drop-
ped the course and consequently
does not have the Add-Drop slip.

Senators Bloom, Greene, and

_Weiss felt that this was an un-

necessary and unwarranted in-
convenience to the students. At-
ter an hour of discussion on
this, Langstaif considered the

senators’ rationale, and request '

 some time  .investigate all

Weiss. Any suggestions can be H

The second part, beginning at _

president and the president pro
tempore of the Senate on proj-
ects completed by SG since Feb-

ruary, along with projects plan-‘ ~

Open discussion will follow,
during which students are urged
to ask questions and to suggest

problem areas that they feel SG .

should consider. All SG senators
are required to attend, and ques-
tions by the student body may
be directed toward senators.

SG President Ken Frederick‘
' has said that he hopes the For-
‘um will be a step toward alle-

viating the lack of communica-
tion between the student body
and their government, and that

the students will use this oppor- .

tunity to offer suggestions and

to learn about the activities of ’

This Forum is the ﬁrst in a ‘ V
series of trimesterly meetings to

inform students of the work of

the Senate, the Executive, and .
the SG Committees. All students’ _

are urged to attend.

\

The recent controversy over Auxiliary Enterprises Director John C.
Langstaff’s ownership of Your Campus Store suggested the necessity of
thoroughly re-evaluating the operation of the University Book Center. We
feel that now is the time to scrutinize other aspects of the Book Center
and present alternative proposals concerning its operation to the Adminis-
tration. ~ .

While the ‘book centers at our regional campuses are reportedly accru-
ing proﬁts, our own Book Center operates at a supposed deficit. We are una-
ware of the precise ﬁnancial status of our Book Center, however, since a
proﬁt-and-loss statement was not made available to us. The statement was
withheld from us in spite of the fact that a few years ago Vice Chancellor
for Finance Lawrence Monnett and the then Student Government (SG)
President John Vrana signed an agreement to divide the Book Center
proﬁts between the University and SG, with SG’s share allocated for stu-
dent activities. .

The Monnett-Vrana agreement is meaningless if the Book Cente

. . never makes a profit. this state of affairs leads us to propose alternative
- plans that would better enable the Book Center to serve our student body.
Students on other campuses currently enjoy discounts on items pur-
chased at their respective ‘book stores. If our Book Center would carry an
’ expanded product line of items bearing the University seal, using catalogs
if space is too limited, the increase in profits could conceivably compensate
for a ten per cent discount available to our student body. Every University
administrator, faculty member, and employee now receives this ten per
cent discount. To include students would in no way contradict with the
University's desire to maintain a quality Book Center, especially since the

The Time To  Act   

 

basement, where school supplies are now sold, could be utilized for catalog
sales.

There is also the long-range goal of establishing a co-operative sys-
tem -of running he Book Center, as many campuses now employ. Although
the concept of the Book Center would possibly be modified with the advent
of a co-op, the students would be best served by this type of venture.

Our proposals are two methods that are employed on other univers-
ity campuses. We have no doubt that a meeting of administrators and
student leaders could produce workable alternatives to the status quo.
We are merely impressing on the’ University community the vital need to

improve the current operation of the Book Center, which we feel is geared

more towards a commercialism of sorts than what we evaluate its main
function to be, namely, servicing our student body.

The petition appealing to students to recognize the need to act is a
step in the right direction, for it is important for us to prove to the ad-
ministration that ours is a widely-accepted cause. We stress that the pro-
posed show of student support for the changes in the Book Center must be
handled in an orderly manner to truly represent the cause. We have no
doubt that student sentiment is behind this, however, since every student
is directly concerned with this issue. It is now the students’ responsibility
to vocalize their opinions on this subject.

SG has taken a step in the right direction by forming a committee
that deals with the Book Center, but this is not enough. We urge SG to rise
to the occasion of representing the students’ interest in this instance.
And we respectfully request that the administration hear our case and
produce a suitable alternative to the existing situation as soon as possible.

A bus trip between the
two cities, 120 miles apart,

whereas the trains, when
they ran, ‘required ahnost
fou-r hours for the same dis-

in two-and-one-half hours
and the New York- Boston
run in one-and-onehalf hours.

INITIALLY, THE Depart-
ment of Commerce will pay
for the test equipment and
also for a share of the pro-
duction vehicles. The rail-
roads will ﬁnance reconstruc-
tion of their trackage and
station facilities and will
manage the project for the
Government.

By providing center -city
to center- city service, the
new trains will be able to
compete with air service, as
it currently takes over "an
hour to travel from either
the New York or Washing-
ton airports to the downtown
areas. In addition, the speed
will far surpass that possible
by bus.

Fares, long the bane of the
passenger train’s existence,
will be competitive with
other modes of transporta-
tion due to government sup-
port of the program, _while
high ﬁxed costs on equip-
ment will be spread over
time by long term loans to
the railroads.

The planners of the new
service expect passenger vol-
ume sufficient to sustain the
trains’ operation permanent-
ly. They feel that a combina-
tion of lower fares, high
speed, and traditional rail-
road comfort cannot be
matched by any other meth-
od of transit.

A SIMILAR project should
be developed for the Pitts-
burgh - Cleveland “corridor.”

. The ‘railroad facilities exist

and the passenger demand is
high: buses between the two
cities leave hourly. A high
speed rail service could cov-
er the distance in little more
than an hour at reasonable
fares and high comfort.

Prof Criticize

Taffer Column
Editor, The Pitt News:

Lewis M. Taffer is wrong. Our
government is not invested with
inexorable powers to force a
man to ﬁght in a war in which
he does not believe. Nor, if one
questions the legitimacy of our
committments, is there a scar-
city of alternatives to upholding
them. i

Our traditional committments
have been to demonstrate be-
fore the world the possibilities
offered by democratic proce-
dures in an open society for
achieving a full and meaningful

life.'0ur committments have not.

been and must not be to dirty
demonstrations with bombs,
chemical agents, napalm and the
murders of civilians that ours is
the noblest and only permissi-
ble mode of existence.

I support the President's pro-

‘ posed revisions in the draft for

the same reason expressed in
the letter to the editor from
_Professors Avery and Delany:

There are those who argue
that a Federally sponsored
transportation program is an
unnecessary intervention in
the private affairs of busi-
ness. Yet by 1980 there will
be more than three times
the current traffic volume on
American highways. The
only possible remedy for this
congestion is an off-highway
system of rapid transit, the
funds for which must come
from the Government.

The Eastern half of the
United States is now experi-
encing the ﬁrst of what
needs to be many such pro-
grams. Hopefully, in the
near future, Pittsburgh will
also beneﬁt from an enlight-
ened Federal transportation
policy.

The pigeons at the Youngs-
town station should not be-
come too complacent, for
they may soon have to make
way for the renewed rush of

Letters to the Editor

Illllllllllllllll

“When it becomes apparent that
this is a. war which will draw
its troops from all strata in so-
ciety, perhaps it will no longer
be so easy for so many to ab
sorb the propaganda in favor of
escalation uncritically.” The
more of us who recognize the
moral implications of our crim-
inal acts within the context of
the Nuremberg doctrine, the
sooner the atrocities will cease
in Vietnam.

Our government cannot tell us

‘who or how to kill, if we do

not wish it to or do not pas-
sively permit it to do so. None
of us can so conveniently avoid
responsibility for our acts or

inaction by laying them off on

a government which we have
constituted. Those of us who
want to cop a plea have too
much dignity to excuse murder
on such ﬂimsy grounds.

If students do not want to be-
come killers, ‘why not engage
your professors in participating
concern by asking that they
withhold grades, or request their
help in advising students of
their responsibilities and oppor-
tunities to resist governmental
pressure to become killers. Af-
ter all, some of us are still
young enough to face the same
draft problems you face, and
many of us not so young have
children who face them or short-
ly will. 7
