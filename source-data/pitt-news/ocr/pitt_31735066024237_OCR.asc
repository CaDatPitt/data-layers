Vandals To Blame
For Car Damage

By ANN WALKER
Pitt News Stolt Writer

A high incidence of automobile
vandalism in the Litchfield Towers
parking garage has prompted stu-
dent car-owners to call on housing
officials for tighter security in the
parking area. A 0

Since last term, 20 cases of auto-
mobile vandalism have ‘ been
reported to campus police, accord-
ing to police Detective Fran‘ Walsh.

The latest incident occurred on
February 1, when seven student-
owned vehicles were severely van-
dalized, Walsh said.

”There have been a lot of cases of
vandalism but it is toughto figure
the cases out because there is a time-
frame question,” Walsh said. ”When
was the last time students checked
their cars before they found the
vandalism_?"

"The damage to the cars is exten-
sive. The vandals broke the pas-
senger side window of my car, stole
$70 to $80 worth of cassette tapes,
bent the antenna, and scratched the

' hood and passengers side with a nail

or screw driver. The scratches were
down to the metal," said one student
whose car was vandalized.

The student said that the Housing
Office feels that the vandalism is
being done by someone having a
garage key, because security is tight
enough‘. ”We feel we’ve made the
Towers garage area properly
secured,” said Director of Housing
Don Hughes.

The security consists of motorized
doors operated by a key, only obtai-
nable by paying the $105 per term
parking fee. The elevators to the
Towers dormitories are shut off and
the access doors to the garageare
operated‘ on a strike system accord-

The Reagan Administration,
‘blindlyfollowing the movement of
the El ~' Salvadorian military-
”civilian" junta toward the far right,
has placed itself in an ”unde'sireable”'
position, according to History
Department professor Harold Sims.

Speaking at a University Honors ‘
Program-sponsered lecture yester-
day, ”El Salvador:The Next _Viet-
nam?”, Sims‘ said those individuals
who were our friends in a coup sup-

--ported by the United States in 19__79,: .
are suddenly our enemies ’because‘ _i

they’ve moved toward the left-center
opposition; referred to as the
guerrillas. 

Sims said we’re forced to support
a junta that the majority of 4.8 mil-
lion El Salvadorians d,on’t*support.

He characterized the administra-
tion’s actions as "extremely stupid”

and charged the State Department -.

with ”a determined effort to avoid
explaining to the American public”
what’s going on there. 

He cited Secretary of State Alex-
ander Haig’s comment broadcastedi
on National Public Radio, that El

' Salvador wouldibeia “test case of our

resolve’-’ to fight communism, and

Pittsburgh’s Renaissance II: ‘Off

Program Attempts To ‘Sell’ City

By FREDERICK BEERS
Pitt News Staff Writer 1

The status of Pittsburgh’s Renais-
sance ll was described as ”off and
running" by Mayor Richard Cali-
guiri on Wednesday at Forbes
Quadrangle.

Speaking before an assemblage of
university students, staff and
faculty, the mayor stressed the need
for the government and the people
to work together.

"We have to set up relationships
that allow the two to come together
more often. . .in establishing priori-

Jties,” Caliguiri said.

Many things have to be done in
the city and particularly in the neigh-
borhoods, the mayor pointed out,
not only in the laying of brick and
mortar but in the integration of
people.

Renaissance ll, a large—scale
urban renewal program, and coined
by the mayor in I977, is another
attempt to ”package" and ’’sell’’

V Pittsburgh.

Its funding is generated through
tax dollars, Community Develo-
ment block grants, city bonds, and
money frm the private sector.

Discussing-more specifically the
plans included in Renaissance ll,
Caliguiri addressed the areas of a
"deteriorating infrastructure," and
‘housing and commercial problems.

He said over half a billion dollars
has been budgeted over the next six
years for infrastructure improve-
ments which include roads, bridges,
sewer and water lines.

”We‘re in the process of looking at

rehabilitate them to get three or four
more years of life out of them while

construction on the Parkway East T

continues.”

He also expressed his desire for
Pittsburgh to rid itself of the title of
”pothole capital.”

In housing, an effort is being
made to rehabilitate through such
things as low-interest loans and
mortgages, Caliguiri said.

''I predict for Pittsburgh that if we
continue this process of reinvest-
ment, more people will move into
the city than out.”

He cited the recent opening of 40
units of rehabilitated housing at
Perry Point. He said half the units
had already been sold.

Commercially, the mayor pointed‘
out five major buildings currently
under construction.

At several points during the .pres-
entation the mayor received
applause, such as when he spoke out
against unnecessary military spend-
ing which cuts into funding renewal
for projects. '

Pittsburgh ‘has ”lived on its past
Renaissance for too long," Caliguiri

said. What the new Renaissance,

represents is ”an older city becoming
new again.’-’

The reason for the latest renewal
effort, he said, is to ”convince people

that Pittsburgh is a good place to‘

live.”

He added that this city. has been
the best kept secret in the East, but

that the time has come’ to let the _

Discussing the antecedents to the
current civil war, Sims said that after
the land reform movement started to
deteriorate, ”reform with repres-
sion", the U.S. ‘government con-
tinued supporting the junta ”no

He said terrorism was rampant,

Sims said an effort to negotiate a
settlement was made duringthe last
daysjof the Carter Administration
but, with attention focused on lran,_
nothing developed. ’

Theinext step, he said, is to send in
surrogate of the U.S. forces from

‘Guatemala and the Honduras. As a

last resort, American intervention

could not be ruled out if the conﬂict .

regional-izes. He added that this

would probably be put off as long as

possible, due,to- public opposition.
The only solution, Sirris said, is to

down in the garage when they leave
the side-access door open during the
day,” said another student who
parks his car in the garage.

Another problem with this side-
access door being open during the
day is that the doors into the Towers
are sometimes left open, which
allows access to the dormitories.

Most of the vandalized cars were
small, darkly-painted, new or new
looking cars. .

’’It seemed as if the vandals used a
screwdriver and scraped a design on
my car by pushing with a lot of force.

The scratches are on the front, back,
and side of my car,”said Karen
Donaghy, Sophomore, who parks
her black, 1980 sports car in the
garage.

Victor Mesalles, ajunior in Indus-
trial Engineering, also owns a new,
small dark car which had deep
scratches on the side and front ofhis
car.

”1 think they should at least put a
policeman down in the garage, since
we’re paying $210 a year, but that
would probably take a year to two
years to get done. By then, I'll be out
of school," Mesalles said.

Accuracy Key to Faster Refund

The fast processing of a federal
income tax return can generally be
summed up in one word: accuracy.

According to Thomas L. Davis,
district director of internal revenue
for western Pennsylvania, taxpayers
who ﬁle accurate returns receive
their refunds more quickly.

Taxpayers can help speed up pro-
cessing by using the pre-addressed
peel-off labels on their tax package

and by checking their arithmetic
before mailing the returns. As sim-
ple as the items appear, Davis said,
they are the cause for thousands of
errors every year.

The label that comes with the tax
package in the mail and lists thetax-
payer’s name, address, Social Secur-
ity number and other bits of
information helps the IRS process
the return quickly.

Board Selects Manage

The

Publications

and Media

Board approved the selection of
Michael Bonino as the new general
manager of WPGH-AM radio sta-

tion Feb. l7.

If any information on the label is
incorrect, the label with corrections
made on it can still be used. Taxpay-
ers should use the pre-addressed
envelope included in the tax package
to mail their returns, since this helps
IRS sort returns more quickly.

Some of the more common rea-
sons that taxpayers’ refunds are
delayed are such easy-to-make
errors as checking the wrong filing
status, failing to sign the return,
math mistakes and the omission of
all necessary documents. Most
errors can be avoided ifthe return is
double-checked for accuracy.

An error-free return, combined
with the use‘of the pre-addressed
label and envelop, will speed up pro-
cessing and mean a faster refund.

O'Pake said. “Many of the centers
started with federal L.E.A.A. (Law
Enforcement Administrative Assist-
ance), but that has been substan-
tially cut back and is running out."

According to Pride, “The second
source of money that a lot ofgroups
are not getting is called Title 20
Funding. That’s money that comes
into the stateithrough the Depart-
ment of Welfare.

“The problem is that it only funds
direct services. It would not fund
many of our education programs or
all of our operation costs because
part of our operating costs are also
education-related. It would also not
fund anybody that was not a counse-
lor or one serving in that capacity,”
she said.

Rape is increasing dramatically in
Pennsylvania and the convictions
are not,” O’Pake said. “These rape
crises centers have been very helpful

and very effective in giving support
after a physically and emotionally
shattering experience.

“Nationally, the odds are one in
I5 that a woman will be raped some-
time in her life. ln a recent twelve-
month period, although there were
over 3,200 sexual assaults reported
in Pennsylvania, only 308 defend-
ants were ever brought to court. Of
these 308 that were tried, only 68
were convicted.

“ln domestic violence, l05,840
women and their children received
shelter and or counseling in 1980,"
he said.

“I am hoping that it will pass,’
Pride said, “but it’s certainly going
to take people letting the legislators
know that they think it’s important.”

“This bill is a major step,” O’Pake
said. “In fact, my prediction is that
unless we do something, in two years
these places will be closed.”

Too High
 A Price   ‘

President Reagan has unfairly chosen a scapegoat in his
drive to cut government waste——the student loan program.

 

By proposing to limit the availability of student loans and
grants, Reagan is cutting much more than government
spending,

Educational opportunities are rights that must remain
within reach of all economic classes. Reagan can do serious
damage if, for political purposes, he tampers with these
opportunities. '

Specifically, Reagan is expected to require substantial
changes in government loans available to both students and
parents.

 

First, the nine percent interestrate on a $25,000 student
loan would have to be repaid by the student while in college,
under the anticipated Reagan proposal. Previously, interest
on this loan was paid by the federal government; The student ,
then repaid the loan after graduation.

7 Second, parent loans—a new program enabling parents to
borrow $3,000 for collegecosts at a nine percent interest
'rate—would be required to carry regular commercial inter-
est rates, according to Reagan’s predicted plan.

Abuse of the program is offered as a rationale for the
stringent regulations. it is possible that the loans can be‘
invested or placed in certificates, thereby earning interest
from the federal government.

Also, the number of student loan defaulters is extensive—
3,680 from Ohio State University alone.

- But before deciding to establish loan requirements which

«would extinguish educational opportunities for many stu-
dents, the Reagan administration should consider two
things: : _ . "

 

i

—Six million college students and parents utilize“govern-
ment loans to cover tuition costs. —
—Fees covering college expenses have doubled in the past

An Opposing View

A Differentslant on the
Educational Loan Cuts

(Ed. Note: The following is a reprint of an editorial that
appeared in the Wednesday, February 18, 1981 issue of The
New York Times.)

“A Sacred but Fat Tuition Cow”

In looking for ways to help cut the Federal budget, Secretary of Education Bell needed to look no farther
than his department’s most sacred cow-—college student aid. His assault is heresy to colleges and parents who
have run up the program to an annual cost of nearly $5 billion. Tuition assistance has grown by 150 percent in
just three years, epitomizing the Government’s loss of control over spending. Mr. Bell is looking in a fat and

‘ proper place. , . I

The Federal Government began helping college students a generation ago, when the Russians frightened
America by winning the race to put a man in orbit. Gradually, the focus of the program shifted from
technological training to the raising of opportunity forpoorer citizens. Another big change occurred in 1978.
In a burst of generosity to the middle class, Congress expanded the number of families eligible for outright
tuition grants and made all students eligible for guaranteed low-interest loans.

No limit was placed on these good intentions. Thus appropriations for direct grants have had to rise from
$1.3 billion in 1976 to $2.6 billion in fiscal 198 I. And the number ofsubsidized borrowers rose from a million
in 1978 to 2.3 million, increasing the cost to Government to $1.6 billion. Even parents who can afford tuition /
can hardly afford not to -use the loans; they can earn twice their cost in very safe investments.

What's more, many of the borrowers have become so casual about repayment that the Justice Department
has had to begin pursuing hundreds of them through the courts.

There are three ways to cut this program without imposing great hardship on many students or colleges.

The Government should charge more interest for the guaranteed loans; they now go for only 9 percent.
Loans should be denied to families that don't really need them. And the least needy families now getting
grants should be given loans instead. _ A _ ‘ . V '

w The Treasurygnow charges no interest for the time the student borrowers spend in college. If the interest
were merely deferred until repayment begins after graduation, the Government could save about $100
million at once and up to $2 billion a year in five years. _4 '

As the author ofa handbook on tuition aid has written, “Parents would be stupid not to take advantage of
all this largesse even if they don't need the money for tuition.” What does that say about taxpayers who‘let
such a program run on? ’

- s

AR

 

 

decade on nearly all college campuses.

Abuses in the loan program can be dissolved in ways other
than limiting educational opportunities.
Loan defaulters can and are being brought to court and
A are forced to repay their loans. The publicity generated by
this government action undoubtedly discourages possible
defaulters. ' . ‘
Loan regulations that would prohibit granting loans to
students whose. parents are in a high income bracket could
help eliminate‘ the problem of investment of college loan

.4 f. money.

.The need to‘ curb government spending cannot over-
shadow the necessity of the availability of education. The

priorities of an administration which would increase defense _

‘ spending while downgrading education and other social
programs have to be questioned. . r

H. ._ Finally, the Reagan administration should take arcloser I
 look “at its priorities before proposing short-sighted solu-
f “ Egtionswin the name of 'econo°mizi_i_ig._.  «   ., . . _

Pitt News Sports Editor

National letter of intent day
brought no surprises for the Pitt

V football staff since most of the

Panthers’ 27 recruits had already
announced their preferences to
attend Pitt in the days and weeks
before.

All but one. And until Thursday
morning, Pitt was forced to wait
with bated breath in the hopes their
recruiting effort would conclude

' with no surprises.

And it did as All-American Bill
Fralic of Penn Hills, probably the
most sought after lineman in the
nation, announced his plans to
attend Pitt over Penn State and
“UCLA. The decision ended one of
the most widely publicized recruit-
ing sagas in the nation, as literally
hundreds of schools pursued the tal-
ents of the 6-5, 260-pound Fralic,
Parade magazine’s Male High
School Athlete of the Year.

Although the decision was
delayed, .Fralic‘s signing with Pitt
hardly came as a complete surprise.
Pitt was rumored to have the inside
track on landing Fralic since early_
January, and it was widely reported
that the two-way tackle preferred to
go to school in a metropolitan area
and stay close to home.

Fralic’s parents may also have had
some inﬂuence in the decision. Both
Bill Fralic Sr. and his wife Dorothy
had repeatedly admitted they pre-
ferred to watch their son play'out his
college football career close to

G B-Neverson
Ends Slump, g
Cans 24 Points

By MIKE DICHIARA
PITT NEWS SPORTS WRITER
Pitt defeated George Washington
‘ by a score of 89-77 Wednesday night
at the Pitt Field House, and in the
process witnessed the re-birth of
guard Carlton Neverson.

_Neverson was spectacular in .the
early part of the season as hescored
24 points against St. Francis; 2|
against St. Bonaventure; l7 against
West Texas State and 24 against Vir-
ginia Tech.

But since then he has been, for the
most part, in the background in the
Panther offense. That is until Wed-
nesday night. Neverson pumped in
24 points, high for the game, which
included a red hot I2-for-I5 from
the floor, in Pitt’s l3th win against
10 losses, GW’s record fell to 6-1 7 on
the year.

’'I’m very happy with Carlton

V Neverson,” said Panther head coach

Roy Chipman. ”l likethe way he was

shooting the ball. He wasn’t off bal-

ance, he was taking his shots straight
up.” ‘

The game did not begin as if it
would be Neverson night. He scored
only four points in the first half on

.two of three shots fromthe field.
‘ Sam Clancy was Pitt’s main weapon
with l2 first-half points and six

 _~ rebounds. Clancy ended with a total

I of-l8 points and nine rebounds for

home. While the elder Bill’s fear of
ﬂying may have been one factor,
against UCLA, Fralic was probably
influenced more by his mother.
Upon her son’s return from a visit to
UCLA, Mrs. Fralic was quoted as
saying, ’’If you go there I'll break
both your legs.”

Happily for Dorothy and Pitt, the
"gentle prodding” prevailed.

”We’re extremely happy to have
Billjoin the team,” Pitt coach Jackie
Sherrill said, who hedged on
whether or not Fralic may step right

into a starting role. ”It's up to him. -

Nothing. will be handed to him,”
Sherrill said.

Sherrill also refused to say what,
position Fralic will play at Pitt.
Fralic, who played both offensive
and defensive tackle in high school,
has stated a preference for the
offense, but Sherrill was non-
committal, saying only "we may suit
him up and play himboth ways for
60 minutes."

The landing of Fralic has largely
overshadowed the official signing_ of
the 26 other Panther recruits, the
largest group of incoming freshmen
since the 1977 class. Even without
Fralic, the Panthers and Sherrill can
boast of another good recruiting
effort, which again landed some of
the top players in the East.

"On paper, it looks like we had a
good recruiting year,” said Sherrill,
”Of course, you never know how it
will turn out two or three years from
now.’.f —

The Pitt recruit roster, features
such standouts as Bob Brown, a 

CARLTON NEVERSON

The game started as though it '
would be a cake walk for the Panth-
ers. Pitt came out ready to play from
the/ start and opened up ’a quick 8-2
lead. There—was not one occasion

where Pitt found itself trailing the ‘

Colonials.

On the strength of Clancy and
Steve Beatty, who had«eight first-”
half points and four" rebounds, the

' Panthers had a comfor_tab"le_46-29
_. lead going into_the_.'lockérroo'm‘* at
T . -:'halfti‘m¢-   .   i 

 

 

‘ pretty good defense

they play.”

‘ have "had an _affe'ct .'qn;,,:l§leve,rson V as

  

285-pound tackle from, Massa-
chusetts, and running back Roger
Kingdom, a 6-2, I90-pound All-
State performer from Georgia.

Kingdom, whose high school
coach called him ”one of the best
athletes to come out of the state
since Herschel Walker,” averaged
7.3 yards a carry last season as he
rushed for over 1,227 yards in only
his first year as a running back.
Kingdom also played defensive back
where he intercepted and returned
three passes for touchdowns of over
50 yards last year. Pitt lists Kingdom
who has 4.5 speed in the 40, as a wide
receiver.

Brown is generally considered one
of the top lineman prospects in the
Northeast. He was a member of the
Newsweek All-American team and
was listed by another magazine
among the top '25 high school
seniors in the country.

The list of Pitt’s local recruit is
headed by running back Marlin
Mclntyre of Belle Vernon, line-
backer Caesar‘Aldisert of Mount
Lebanon and Mike Huwar of
Frazier.

Mclntyre, 6-] and 190-pounds,
was generally considered one of the
top three high school running backs

‘ in Western Pennsylvania this past

season. Though hampered by injur-

ies he gained over 600 yards this past,

year, and rushed for over 1,000

yards as a junior. Mclntyre chose- W

Pitt over West Virginia, Ohio State

. and Michigan.

   
  

Pitt came out for the second 20'
_minutes ofplay like they did for the
first, very fast, and widened the gap

Q Lapses Hurt Spikers
 At Pitt Invitational

By JOHNETTE HOWARD
Pitt News Sports Editor

Although the result of last Sun-
day’s match against national power
Rutgers-Newark will officially go
down in the record books as a loss
for the Pitt men’s vollyball team, it

7 may also go down as the turning

point ‘of the l98l season for the
young Panther squad.

Despite the loss in five games to S

the Eastern champions which
dropped the Panthers record to 9-7,
the match had to be a moral victory
for Pitt in the emotional aspect of
their game, after mental lapses at the
Pitt Invitational Tournament last
Friday and Saturday probably pre-
vented the team from finishing
higher at the meet.

Pitt advanced to the second
reound of the invitational quarterfi-
nals with an impressive two-game
sweep of Kellogg Community col-

lege before being eliminated by’

Queens in two games, the Panthers
second loss to the Canadians at the
tournament.

The invitational, generally consi-
dered the premier tournaments in
the East and Midwestfor its I6-team

size and quality, was won by Penn
State in a mild upset.

The Nittany Lions, ranked ninth
nationally last year, defeat third-
ranked Ohio State in the final, l5-3
and I5-I3, in a battle of the tourna-
ments two unbeaten teams. Both
squads ripped through pool-play
and the semifinal round without los-
ing a singlegame. Rutgers-Newark,
ranked No. 4 last year, defeated
Queens in the battle for third place
in a close match, I5-ll, 9-15 and
I5-I I.

It was mostly lapses of intensity
that cost the Panthers a chance at
finishing higher at the lnvitational,
which the team emerged from with a
2-3 tournament record adter finish-
ing third in their four-team pool at
1-2, behind Queens and Ball State.

A team that lives by emotion often -

dies by it-or loses by it in the sport's
world’s equivalent. Take a highly
emotional team with a lost of physi-
cal ability such as Pitt, and it may
lose less, but still, more frequently

 

 

Strong blocking at the net helped Pitt in its match against Ball State. 8

than it should. Despite playing well
in the majority of their matches, the
Panthers still came up on the short
end of the scored more often than

not.

Pitt seemed destined to continue
thir tendency against Rutgers-
Newark on Sunday after playing
exceptionally well, but losing in the

first two games ofthe league match, '

I5-I0 and I5-I0. Pitt seemed ready
to crack mentally under Rutgers-
Newark’s pressure, something’ the
young Panther team has done often
in other matches andagainst lesser
opponents.

“We were scared going into the
match because they are Rutgers,”
said Panther setter Scott Robbins,

Win Over WVU Crucial For Homecourt  

—-—-rontinued from page eight
first-place team plays the eighth-
place team, the second place team
plays the seventh place team, and so
on. I

The Panthers’ fate could well be
decided tomorrow. The top four
teams will gain the home-court
advantage in the tournament and
Pitt is in a dog-fight with Rutgers for
that spot. St. Bonaventure cannot be
overlooked either since its next
game is Sunday against Duquesne in
the Civic Arena.

Hockey Club
Drops Two

By SAUL MARKOWlTZ'

Pitt News Sports Writer

The Pitt Hockey team placed
fourth at the Pitt lnvitational
Hockey Tournament last weekend
with a pair of loses to Buffalo State
and Duquesne.

Buffalo State defeated Pitt 3-0 on
Saturday in the opening match,

aided by two controversial calls by h

the referees in the thirdperiod. The
controversy erupted when a shot by
Buffalo’s Ron Bowen was ruled a.
goal, despite the protests of . the
Panthers, who said the puck never
crossed the goal line. Later, with
under a minute left in the game, Buf-
falo’s Chris Daniels took what
looked like an offside pass and slid
the puck into the empty Pitt net.

“They cost us the game,“ said Pitt
Coach Jim Nelson. “I was apalled by
their lack of effeciency.“

Duquesne struck quickly in the
game on Sunday with two quick first
period goals tobeat Pitt 4-I ..d.espite

A’ another outstanding game by Pitt b
 goaltender Jeff -Rohay.  " 1  I '

  

Pitt is presently fourth in the con-
ference with a 6-4 record. Rutgers is
fifth with a 6-5 record and St.
Bonaventure is sixth at 6-6.

If West Virginia finishes first, it
will draw Massachusetts at home in
the opening round since the Minute-
men have clinched their third con-
secutive cellar finish. If WVU
finishes second, it will draw George
Washington, ateam not much better
than UMass.

Pitt’s motivation is that it wants
the home-court advantage in the
first round. The Panthers finish the
regular’ season on the road at
Rutgers and, if the Scarlet Knights
take fourth and Pitt fifth, the Panth-
ers would have to play them one
more time. Pitt coach Roy Chipman

“They had us rattled after the second
game.”

The Panthers led‘ in that game 10-
7 before Rutgers reeled off eight
unanswered points to win it and
threatened to sweep Pitt in thre
straight games for the match.

As the teams switched sides of the
court, one of the Rutgers palyers
told his teammates, ‘‘If they can’t
deal with themselves, how can they
deal with us?”

Pitt responded by storming back
to deal Rutgers two straight defeats,
I5-7 and l5-I0, on the strength ofa
stalwart blocking defense that
repeated frustrated the Rutgers hit-
ters at the net. The Panthers were
beating Rutgers at their own game
as the Pitt hitting attack came alive,
led by several important kills by Bill
Knuth and Gary Groshner.

“Going into" the match, I remem-
bered Rutgers hitting their shots
over me at the net last year, but Sun-
day, when I went up for a block the
first time and the ball brushed off my
hands, I knew we could play with
them,” said senior middle blocker
Brian Devine.

“After the /first two games, we
knew we had outplayed them, and
we realized that it was our own mis-
takes which hurt us,” Robbins said.
“That gave us the confidence to go
on and win the next two games.”

Rutgers-Newark revived its hit-
ting and blocking attack just in time
to defeat Pitt in the fifth game, I5-6,
for the match. Even so, the Panthers

7 style. of play was", an important
'confid.ence-builder for the team,

which starts two freshmen and two

_ sophomores, and may finally get the V

Panthers over the emotionalw’aver-

ings that have caused the team to

falter in some past games this year.

Pitt was also aided in its victory by
consistency. The Panthers shot 54

Sc e ey.

After 15 interviews with various com-
panies, I finally found MITRE. And after 15
interviews I definitely knew whatl was look-
ing for when I saw it.

I had to have breathing room. A place

that would turn me loose and let me work on
different kinds of projects. On the other
hand, I had to know I'd be able to turn to
‘other people for advice and backup. And I
definitely wanted a steady growth situation.
‘ With the MITRE people, I knew right

away I'd found it all.

. At any given time, they have some 75

or so funded, significant programs involving
’_ Several hundred separate projects and

tasks. And because.they'reTechnical Ad-
visors to the Air Force's Electronic Systems .
Division in Command, Control and Com-
rnunications (C3), they design and develop
some of the world's most advanced.informa-

tion systems. .

Still, MITRE handles every assignment’
as if it were the only-one. Because they have
to come up with the right solution every time.
That's their product.

The best of MITRE to me is that they'll
let me move from project to project if I want,
or get deeply involved in a longer-range one.
There‘s always something waitingforme.

l‘m'gIad it took 15 interviews to get to
MITRE. Now when I say I chose them, I

know exactly what I'm talking about.
