Drama Plays on Lawn Today.

‘Cox and Box’

S Shown Over TV

Scenes from the Univer-
sity’s production of “Cox and

Box,” which will open on the

lawn of the Cathedral today
at 4 p.m., have been broad-
cast during the past week over
WQED—TV as part of the station’s
promotion for the Three Rivers
Arts Festival.

V The University Theater, in co-,.
operation with the‘ Department of
Music, will. again present-‘ “Cox
and Box” on the Cathedral lawn
May 31 and at_ Gateway Center
June; 1 at 4 p.m. as its part of
the Arts Festival being held to-
day through June 5. The per-
formances on the Heinz , Chapel
side of the Cathedral are free and
open ‘to the public.

“This outdoor production. will 

be a challenge tothe actors,” ac-

cording to Gil Lazier, ‘co-stage"

director and choreographer. “It’s
the ﬁrst_ time we here at Pitt
have had the. opportunity to do
a show on the grass.” ' '

Lazier noted speciﬁcally the

problems of projection, lack of

resonance, and extraneous noises
that will face the actors. .They
will also be unable to use the

_artiﬁcial light to which they are

accustomed. However, “we learn
a great deal from ‘doing shows in
places other than. the theater,” re-
marked" Phil Eck, = designer for

the show. “It puts us on our

I

mettle.” . ~

‘ The two songs from the dress
rehearsal broadcast over WQED
were “Who Are You." Sir,” sung

by Robert Sestili.‘ Gil Lazier,.

’and ‘James Berry,. and “The
Buttercup Serenade,” sung by
Gil Lazier and ‘James Berry.
An added feature, according to
Lazier, will be the inclusion of
Ruthie Kitz’s solo before curtain
Miss Katz will be billed on the
program as presenting “delight-
ful and endearing- vocal’ selec-
tions” prior to the main show.
“It will lend to the show as a
whole an air of nineteenth cen-

tury English Music Hall nostal-

gia,” Lazier commented.

The Festival at Gateway Cen-
ter will include, besides the Uni-
versity production, displays of
the visual arts and a,varied pro-
gram of the performing arts. Day
and evening entertainment will
include symphonic‘ music ballet,-
jazz, band concerts, choral groups,
and drama.

Tickets -for ‘Rain’
Available Today

Tickets for the ,Pitt Player’s
production of “Rain” are avail-
able beginning today, according
to the University Theatre. The
play will run June 12-15, at 8:30
p.m. in Stephen Foster Memorial.

Student and faculty members
will receive free tickets on pre-
sentation of invoices or proper
faculty identiﬁcation. Tickets
costing $1.25 will be available
at the door for all others.

An added attraction of the pro-
duction will be the use of real
rain. The precipitation will be
provided by pipes perforated with
holes, and a special covering will
be used on the ﬂoor to protect it
from the water. A tin roof will be
used to ’ give the proper sound

Mrs. Everard Pinneo, faculty co-
ordinator for the group, said the
first work will be a series of tu-
toring and study hall operations
throughvthe Soho House for stu-
dents having no room to study at
home. — '

“W_e will.try to help particular
students with deﬁnite problems in
basic . subjects,” she "said. “This
ﬁrst project will provide a won-
derful trial ground for the pro-

for _'undergraduate, graduate, and
professional students and for the
school children.”

The group, headed by Mellers,
will appeal for workers this Fall,
when an all-out drive for volun-
teers will begin. Volunteers can
contribute as little as one hour a
week to helping Hill students. In-
terested students may call ext.

Harvard has a similar project

in operation called the Philips

of May, the three students and
Mrs. Pinneo were the guests of
the House and investigated the
various operations of such ‘a

noted, “they are involved with

, Lucius Crump, a 23-year-old
unemployed laborer,‘ has been in-

’ _ dicted for the theft of .a $400 cam-

 

era from the Owl office. The cam-
’era belonged to Joel Filner, 1963
Owl editor.

At the hearing on May 25,
Marie Henry, YMCA secretary,
'testiﬁed' that Crump was seen on
the fourth floor where the Owl
‘office is situated, -shortly before
Filner discovered that the camera
was missing on May 21.

Crump was apprehended when

i he tried to pawn the camera for

twelve dollars at the Central Loan

.Company on Center ‘Avenue. It

was readily identiﬁed by the de-

scription and serial numbers fur-

nished to the police by Filner.

Filner had notiﬁed - Captain
Charles Ray of the University Se-

theft was discovered. Ray,-in turn,
informed the Pittsburgh Police,

  “who conducted the investigation.

The _camera, a. Leica with a
special wide angle lens and
variable viewﬁnder, was in-
sured, according to Filner. He
had notiﬁed the insurance com-

'pany of the loss as soon as he
was positive that the camera
had not accidentally been mis-
placed.

Crump, Filner, and Miss Henry
,all attended the hearing at Num-

Sage Remarks

By BOb‘Smizik

Sports Editor

 

‘The decision of the ‘NCAA Baseball selection committee
not to include the Panther baseball team in the district play-

‘ oﬂ.’s,»i_s one of little sense and poor judgment.

We have no qualms with three " of . the cornr‘nittee’s
choices: Rider, Temple and St. Johns. * But it is inconceivable
to us how the committee chose Penn State instead of Pitt on
the basis of the teams’ records and personnel.

An examination of the schedules of:the twoteams show_

that Penn State._did play the name schools and have a- tougher
schedule. This partly accounts _for"the Panthers better. rec-
ord. They are 16-3 as compared _to the.Lion’s, mark of 11-4'.
Pitt lost and won one after the committee made its decision,
so actually the Panthers were 15-2 when the committee

» made its choices. _

‘The two games Bobby Lewis’ team lost were to. West
Virginia. sThis ‘is no disgrace. The Mounties are the na-
tion’s third ranked team andhad the finest won—loss record

-of any college team —- 29-1. -

Penn State also lost ,to__'West Virginia.’ They also lost to

Navy —— a team- that Pitt beat. This in itself should have‘

swayed the committee. V , p B
If that did not then‘ a look at the Penn "State personnel
should-have. ‘Lewis, a former member of the Committee,
says the group looks for teams that will ./-best represent
the district in the NCAA world ‘series.at'Omaha in June.
The_ world series is a double elimination. aﬁair and teams
play as many as live or six games. , _ ’
Bob Fenton, an outstanding pitcher, has nine of the
Lion's 11 wins. They have no one else capable of -winning

in the NCAA world series. They do not even have anyone

P.

else capable of winning in the district playoffs. With Fenton
on the mound Penn State is tough. Without Fenton they
are just another team.

Lewis, on the other hand, has a well rounded staff. Of

 course, theyrely'o‘n John"Carlisle, but he has won only 33

..-per cent of the Panther’ games, not 82 per cent like Fenton

has done for Penn, State. 1
It is obvious that theirschedule of many local small -
colleges cost the ‘Panthers the bid. .Lewis should take.
pains to ‘get more .big name opponents on the schedule
next year. , ' ‘ _
A But the~fault is not with the Panther coach. Far from it.
It lies solely with the selection committee, who failed to cor-
rectly evaluate the teams and thus snubbed a team that had
a good chanceto give the East its best- representation in the
NCAA world series in many years. 9

TILL WE MEET AGAIN

With today’s installment Incomplete my ninth year of writing
columns in your college newspaper for the makers of Marlboro
Cigarettes. In view of the occasion, I hope I may be forgiven
if I get a little misty. ' . _ _ . '

These nine years have passed like nine minutes. In fact,
I would not believe that so much time has gone by except that
I have my wife nearby as a handy reference. When I started
columning for Marlboros, she was a slip of a girl-—supple as a
reed and ’fair as the sunrise. Today she 1S gnarled, lumpy, and

given to biting the postman. Still, I count myself lucky. Most .

of my friends who were married at the same time have wives
' who chase cars all da.y. I myself have never had this trouble
and I attribute my good fortune to the‘ fact that I have never
struck my wife with my hand. I have always used a folded

 

  

 

lTé ma

newspaper—-even throughout the prolonged newspaper‘ strike
in New York. During this period I had the airmail edition of

the Manchester Guardian ﬂown in daily from England. I must .

confess, however, that it was not entirely satisfactory. The air-
mail edition of the Guardian is printed on paper so light‘ and
ﬂimsy that it makes little or no impression when one slaps one’s
wife. Mine, in fact, thought it was some kind of game, and tore
several pairs of my trousers.‘ ‘ t 1

But I digress. I was saying what a pleasure it has been to
write this column for the last nine years for the makers of
Marlboro Cigarettes—a ﬁne group of men, as anyone who has

sampled their wares would suspect. They are as mellow as the

aged tobaccos they blend. They are as pure as the White cellulose
ﬁlter they have devised. They are loyal, true, companionable,
and constant, and I have never for an instant wavered in my
belief that some day they will pay me for these last nine years.
But working for the makers of Marlboro has not been the
greatest. of my pleasures over the last nine years. The chief
satisfaction has been writing for 3/ou—the college population
of America. It is a. rare and lucky columnist who can ﬁnd an
audience so full of intelligence and verve. I would like very
much to show my appreciation by asking you' all over to my
house for tea and oatmeal cookies, but there is no telling how
many of you my wife would bite.
For many of you this is the last year of college. This is espe-
cially true for seniors. To those I extend my heartfelt wishes
that you will ﬁnd the world outside a happy valley. To juniors
I extend my heartfelt wishes that you will become seniors. To
sophomores I extend my heartfelt wishes that you will become
juniors. To freshmen I extend my heartfelt wishes that you will
become sophomores. To those of you going on into graduate
school I extend my heartfelt wishes that "you Will marry money.
' To all of you let me say one thing: during the year I have
been frivolous and funny during the past year-possibly less
often than I have imagined—but the time has now come for
some serious talk. Whatever your status, whatever your plans,
I hope that success will attend your ventures. I

Stay happy. Stay loose. a 1963 Max Shulman

3|! * *
We, the makers of Marlboro Cigarettes, confess to more than

a few nervous moments during the nine years we have spon-
sored this uninhibited and uncensored column. But in the

main, we have had fun and so, we hope, have you. Let us.

add our good wishes to Old Max's: stay happy; stall loose.
