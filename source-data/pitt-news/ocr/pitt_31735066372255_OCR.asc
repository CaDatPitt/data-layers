QPA Cutoff Set

Athlete Attendance Rule Revised

By SETH LUBOVE

Athletes with a 2.26 Quality Point
Average (QPA) or above who have
failed a course in the previous fall or

winter term will be exempt from the ‘

recently—adopted mandatory class
attendance program. Pitt's Senate
Council decided Monday.

in addition. athletes with a 2.25
.QPA or less will be considered indi-
vidually by the Senate Council
Athletic Committee to determine if
they should be exempted.

Douglass Thompson. M.D..
chairman of the Senate Council
Athletic Committee, who intro~
duced the proposal before the coun-
cel, said his committee “felt 2.26 was
a reasonable cut-point." He add.ed
that the cutoff points of both the
university and the,,.NCAA are con-
siderably lower.

Thompson said that, to date.
approximately 220 student—athletes
have been entered into the program
to retain their eligibility since it was
passed by the Senate Council this
summer. .

He said that l6 of these athletes in
the program will be exempted
because they have QPAs of“2.2_6 or
above and have received only one F.
ln addition. there are nine student-
athletes with QPAs of 2.25 or below

and one F who will be individually
considered for exemption.

“There was a special group (of
student~athletes) who really uidn’t
need this kind of monitoring to go to

classes.” Thompson said after the
meeting.

According to the proposal passed
by the Senate Council this summer,
any student on the current athletic

intercollegiate eligibility list must
take a minimum of [2 credits each
term to remain eligible.

First—year students on academic
probation or who failed a course in
the previous term have to submit
class attendance cards to their
instructors at the end of each week,
beginning the first week after the
add/drop period ends.

The student must then submit the
cards to the athletic department at
the end of each week. lf the student
doesn’t submit the card or fails to
attend any class regularly for two
consecutive weeks, he or she is
ineligible for practice, competition
or travel for a week.

Thompson said the program has

V received positive response so far

from most of the student—athletes,
faculty and coaches.

In other business, Chancellor
Wesley Posvar told the council that
a proposed 5 percent tuition hike in
fiscal year l983 is “a somewhat arbi-
trary figure.” 5

The decision to submit a proposed
5 percent tuition hike with its $85.5
million appropriations‘ request to
the state for fiscal year l983 “was
really just a gesture" on the part of
Pitt, Posvar said. indicating to the

EDITOR’S NOTE:

Arnold Klein, a Pitt student,
spent last summer as an item on
the staff of Pennsylvania Con-

, gressman Eugene Atkinson.
Whatfollows is an adaptation of
a report Klein wrote for a class.
The Pitt News thought that pre-
senting such an account of one
person’s experience might help
illustrate the opportunities to be

found in an intership, particu-
larly, one located so close to the
nation's centers of power.

By ARNOLD KLEIN A

The primary interest of the Con-
gressman is his co.nstituents. Most of
the.mail we receive comes from his
constituents. Many ofthe letters tell
him to support a certain bill. or
advise him to vote against a particu-
lar bill. There are many thank-yous
and letters of appreciation. but oth-
ers are spiteful and nasty. I know

. that you can’t please everybody in
this business. but l can‘t believe how
many so-called “friends” become
enemies in a matter of minutes. just
because there are differences of
opinion. -

Several pieces of mail are
requests. There are some days when
the Congressman receives 10 invita-

‘tions' to different events which all
take place on the same day and at the
same time. Nine or even all I0 of
these groups will be turned down
and they often become disgusted.
These people just don’t realize how
busy a very important political fig-
ure in Washington is. Besides dis-
cussing issues with his staff and
personal friends. Mr. Atkinson has
clients to deal with. {votes that make
him rush back to the House Floor
from wherever he is. and many other
functions that tie up his schedule.

One request letter that stuck in my
mind was from a woman who
wanted the Congressman to send a
congratulatory note to her 90-year-
old father. lt seemed rather stupid to
me at first, but I could see that this
man would appreciate such a letter.
after I thought about it for awhile.

The main concern of most of the
Congressman*’s staff is how to deal
with all this mail and what proce-
dures to use. Not counting any
interns and the four district offices.
Mr. Atkinson’s Washington staff
consists of nine people. The Con-
gressman’s right-hand man. Robb.
is the administrative assistant. A lot

afof Robb’s work is done privately on

the telephone. He deals with many
items that are kept secret for various
reasons. He has many contacts and
keeps "Mr. Atkinson informed on

:-everything. Robb also attends some,

unctions with the Congressman and
orks on certain pieces of mail.

The Pitt .'Ven‘.\‘, H'e¢lI1estlaI‘. October /4. 1981

Pitt Student In erns in Capital  

Other people on the staff are the
legislative assistants: Gerry. Tom
and Jewel Lee. They do in-depth
research and brief Mr. Atkinson on
certain matters. Since there are'so
many subjects to deal with. each-
legislative assistant is assigned to a
specific subject to insure that the
research runs smoothly. Gerry usu-
ally deals with steel. Tom is con-
cerned with public works and
transportation. and Jewel Lee han-
dles Social Security. ln order to
research anything. one can use the
Library of Congress; call specific
subcommittees. committees or agen-
cies; read the Congressional Quar-
terly. Congressional Record and
bills and reports that are handed out
daily; or simply call someone who
has the required information.

A very important peron on the
staff is the press secretary. Bernice.
She has to be at he} best at all times.
because one never knows when the
media will call for some kind of
information. The press secretary has
to answer to her fellow press
members on the actions of the Con-
gressman. which can be trying when
the Congressman votes on some-
thing to the displeasure of the con-
stituents. She also spends a lot of
time writing the newsletters that go
out to hundreds of Mr. Atkinson‘s
contacts. Bernice has to set up all the
interviews with newspaper. radio
and television stations. Her major
concern is to get Mr. Atkinson’s
name and face in the press as much
as possible. However. as the game of

0 politics is played. his name also

appears at times when Bernice and
the Congressman wish it hadn‘t.

Politics can be a brutal business. and ’

politicians have to watch out for
people who will stab them in the
back if even a minor mistake is
made.

Our office manager. who is also in
charge of the interns. is Marty. Her
main concern is the mail. She is the
one who proofreads letters written
by the staff. She checks for punctua-
tion and grammar errors. and for
anything that may be false. After she

' says a letter is all right. the Congress-

man reads over‘ it before he signs.
and he may also add a comment or
two at the end of the letter.

The full-time computer operator
is Rich. If a petition with l.000
names is sent in. the office staff
makes up one letter and then_ runs
the rest of them offon the computer.
instead oftyping out all l.000 letters.
The staff also,writes letters to con-
stituents and types them up on the

       
   
  

~ _\\\s\\ \ I‘.

computer. The interns code every
piece of mail because the computer
can easily look up a certain name
-and provide the document number.
From there. youjust look in the files
and. thanks to the interns. all the
numbers are now correctly in order!

I attended six hearings, l4 semi-
nars or lectures and l7 receptions.
researched I5 letters. assisted in
every type of office work. became
intern coordinator and went on sev-
eral tours.

  WHO IS
DAVID DANDY
  SILVEIQMAN

 “Girls Try tol-"ind Out”

The first hearing that I attended
was the most impressive. lt dealt
with the proposed Social Security
cuts. and Secretary of Health and
Human Services Richard Schweiker
was there to testify. I couldn‘t
believe how manycameras were
there. too. and the interns weren‘t
allowed in until the crowd started to
thin out.

The lecture given by Congress-
man Jack Kemp was the best talk
that I heard in my eight-week
stay.He spoke for the scheduled
hour and also stayed for an extra 45
minutes to talk to the interns who
still had some questions about the
Kemp-Roth tax bill. That's just a
minor item. but I remember those

, little things that a person does and l

The receptions were one of the

T Cbiggest highlights for all the interns.

You could tell who the interns were
because they were the ones feeding
their faces at the table. It was their
dinner for that day.

It got to the point where you
would see the same interns at each
receptfon. The interns labeled me
the “Reception Chairman” because I
had a lucky knack of finding out
where every reception was.

The one reception l’ll never forget
was hosted by the U.S. Tobacco
Company. If you like alcohol. this
reception was a great place to be.

and if you love food. this same ”

reception catered greatly to those
needs also!

At different receptions I shook
hands and spoke with.Sen. Ted
Kennedy. Sen. Henry Jackson. Con-
gressmen Jack Kemp and Doug
Walgren and David Stockman. At
vprious lectures l met Secretary of
Transportation Drew Lewis. Con-

gressman Barney Frank. Sen; Bill
Bradley and Sen. Patrick Moyni-
han. Of all these people.the one who
impressed me the most was Kemp. I
went to his lecture. attended a recep-
tion where he spoke. and also heard
him give a speech at the Republican
National Club. If he ever decides to
run ‘for president. and I think it‘s a
good possibility. I told Mr. Kemp
that he already has somebody in
Pennsylvania who would help him
on his campaign.

Although these men are great pol-
itical figures in this nation. the peo-
ple that I really benefited from and
enjoyed being with were the other
interns. When I came in the middle

of May. the floor I was on contained .

the very first summer interns of
I98 I. Nobody knew each other. but
you would never have believed it.
We went out to bars or restaurants
and on tours with -big groups. and
became one big family. They had a
surprise birthday party for me after
knowing me all of 3 weeks. It was
really touching. We talked about
our futures late at night or at dinner
in a restaurant. and we always talked
politics. ‘

We figured at least.three of us in
our large group would become con-
gressmen or senators in the future.
Already twotinterns whom I know
were offered jobs to stay in
Washington. and they both
accepted. There were several interns
from Texas. so we decided tohave a
reunion after Christmas this year at
my friend Mike‘s house in Texar-
cana. Texas. If everyone who said
they will try to come does. there will
be over 20 interns. We came as
strangers and left as brothers and
sisters. It was an experience l’ll never
forget!

During the l960’s, university
fac-ulties and administrators
behaved like “clear idiots” because
they expected exponential growth in
the student population which did
not materialize, leaving empty stu-
dents’ dreams of grand futifres,
according to Willis Sibley.

Sibley. a professor of anthropol-
ogy at Cleveland State University.
spoke to a Pitt audience about the
declining opportunities for graduate
anthropologists in academia. and
illustrated some possibilities for
them in the world outside"the univer-
sity by discussing his concern about
water systems, which he maintained
is a field covered by traditional
anthropological study.

Sibley said thatvcity dwellers are 1

locked into lives dependent on tech-
nologies of the I9th century. when
most city water systems were built.

Speaking of his water research in
Pittsburgh. Sibley noted that he was
“fumbling toward” developing a
sequence of past decisions on the
construction of sewers, bridges. and
water systems—normally mundane
objects of study~-and their chang-
ing values over time.

costly behavior in using that water is
a cultural attitude which distin-
guishes between fresh water and
waste water. Such an attitude ﬂies in
the face of everything we know
about water." he said. maintaining
that all water is recycled and remains
in the ecosystem.

He called our views about water a
“covert cultural area” and a “taboo
subject."

Bathrooms are our household
shrines. he said. and Americans have
almost “pathological” concepts
about cleanliness and bodily waste.

Turning to the main point of his
speech, “Leaving the Academy."
Sibley said that up until the ruckus
at the end of the l960’s. an anthro-
pologist could find a teachingjob at
a good salary. Due to the increas-
ingly saturated academic field in
anthropology. Sibley predicted that
most anthropology graduates will in
the future have to leave the
academy—-go outside of teaching,
the traditional field for
anthropologists.

academic institutions while the
other 85 percent will have to look
elsewhere.

He termed such an outlook devas-
tating. leaving most everyone in
academia depressed. Such a situa-
-tion will force different kinds of
training in the future.‘ he said.

academic field—~is “not simply

tough on students, but also is tough
on the moral sensibilities of facul-
ties." he added.

Faculty members are left helpless
since they no longer know what to
teach to meet their students‘ new
needs. according to Sibley.

Although there are limitations
caused by “the tyranny of the disci-
pline" Sibley said anthropologists
can generally do anything their
counterparts can since their inde-
pendent fieldwork takes them into
areas such as economics. political
science and psychology.

He added that those who wish to
remain in traditional anthropologi-
cal research should certainly do so.

He also urged students to explore
alternative areas such. as health sys-
tems. mental health systems. welfare
and community planning.

Sibley condemned cutbacks in
hiring at the Environmental Protec-
tion Agency. the administration in
Washington who are not as seriously
committed to protecting our fragile
planet as some of us would like."

He urged anthropologists to con-
sider administrative careers which
he said could be creative.

he said.

The upshot. according to Sibley.
is that “in return for the risk you take
in getting your head ‘cut off. you do
get the opportunity to help plan and
to execute."

He identified a problem likely to‘
be encountered by students leaving
the academic field which is difficulty
interesting employers who are look-
ing for more practical than theoreti-
cal disciplines.

He urged students not to go to the
personnel departments “because
those gatekeepers are perhaps the
least likely people to know what you
can do."

Sibley studied economies with
Milton Friedman. “the guru of
supply-side economics.“ heisaid, at
the University of Chicago and
received a D in his graduate theory
course.

Since “the numerical stuff kind of -

got to me." he switched over to
anthropology and received his

‘PhD. in that field.

His current interest is in techno-
logical systems. their adoption to
human life and their consequences.

Concerned Students Help Peers With Problems

continued from page one

“If people have problems-and
they don’t have to be big problems
for them to call—if they have prob-
lems. they can‘t expect to call up
here and get solutions. All they can
get is alternative ways to handle
their problems.

“Sometimes. callers try to put you
in the corner. They try to get you to
tell them what they should do. We
tell them we can’t. We don’t know
the full details. Counselors wouldn't
tell you what to do either. We ask
them ifthey’d like to talk to someone
like that."

“If they say yes, we refer them to
several places. mostly the Counsel-
ing and Student Development
Center.”

The Hotline has been around Pitt.
in one form or another. since I969,
the brainchild of one nameless,
industrious woman. At that time,
the university was interested in try-
ing to curb the drug problem. With
the help ofthe university. the Coun-

GENERAL FOODS

seling Center. the faculty and the
YMCA. the Hotline was created.

The staff was paid at the time, but
that ended when the need for the
Hotline dropped off in I973.

“The drug problem wasn't in
vogue then," Michelle says. “It
wasn’t in the media as much. People
connected it more with the ‘60s."

Michelle joined the hotline in the
fall of I979. when she was a fresh-
man. There were a few old members
left, and a lot of apathy and
questioning.

“A lot of major products need to
go through that stage.” she says.

Since then. the Hotline has reco-
vered. Soon after she was screened.
Michelle threw herself into the pro-
ject, and before long she became
coordinator. Now 2'/3 years later.
the Hotline is still around.

The first thing Michelle did after
passing screeningw a system of role
playing that helps the volunteerto
learn how to handle types of calls-- -
was to launch a massive publicity
campaign designed to let students

know the Hotline was there. Almost
immediately. the Holine was
swamped with calls.

Michelle. who had only been
screened the fall before, “acquired a
lot of on-the-job training."

“At the time. we were still very
experimental, very threatening with
our philosophy of anyone can help
anyone. A lot of problems we got
then we still hear about now-~ drugs.
sex. social problems." '

Many of the problems volunteers
at the Hotlinethear about are those
concerning the social adjustment to
school.

“A lot of calls have to do with
anger with roommates. confusion
over sexual roles. You might get a
young female who doesn’t want to
be taken advantage of by guys and
she has a hard time understanding
why guys don‘t understand that. A
lot of guys come to school thinking
that nobody sleeps alone.

“lt’s confusing." Michelle says. “A
lot ofstudents don’t know how to fit
sex into their lives.” ..

Qrange Cappuccino  
and a desk top for two...

Other major problems on which
the Hotline receives calls are reli-
gion. birth control and alienation.

‘9 “After a while. students find out
that they can't always define them-
selves by which classes they take. or
which parties they go to.

“Often they come to school believ-
ing what a typical college student
does, and find that they don't fit the
mold. So they begin to do things to
fit in. things they may not feel com-
fortable with. like drinking or doing
drugs."

One of the biggest and most fre-
quent problems that Michelleruns
into is student depression’.

“With the university. it is a ques-
tion of politics about how much we
can handle. We generally can handle

' people who are depressed for a spe-

cific reason. like they failed a test, or
had a fight with their roommate. For
anything more we like to suggest
counseling. ‘

“Carl Rodgers believes that the
university isn‘t a place for reality.

state “that a modest increase was
something we would have to
accept.”

Posvar also commented on the
proposed College of Arts and Sci-
ences curriculum reforms, which call
for tougher math and writing
requirements and the institution ofa
new foreign language requirement.
He said the curriculum changes. if
approved by the Faculty of Arts and
Sciences. would involve “a tremen-
dous problem of implementation."

Posvar elaborated on the curricu-
lum reform issue in an interview last
week. _

“The total effect is that they (the
curriculum reform proposals)
represent a treme'ndoiLs progressive
step forward toward giving focus to
undergraduate liberal arts educa-
tion.“ Posvar said in the interview.

“What I respect in them is that
they’re trying to deal with outcomes:
they’re not trying to deal with
numerical requirements and such.”
he said in the interview.

Posvar said his only reservation
with the reforms centered on the
language
requirement that would be imposed
on students who had little pre-
college foreign language training
“through a deficiency in our public
schools system."

“I. think it‘s unfair.“ he said.
adding that such students should be
given “a more flexible oppoiltunity"
to learn about international affairs.

Seriously
Now

This week, students interested in running
for Pitt’s Student Government Board can

0

begin collecting the 150 signatures they’ll—

need to launch their candidacies.

With the start of the SGB campaign now
upon us, we thought it useful to warn the Pitt
community just what is in store for them by

S recalling the highlights of campaigns of the

previous years. Who could forget such shin-
ing moments in -the history of student elec-
tions as: a e

0 ,,the infamous l979_ “Wassergate” inci-
dent, in which SGB. jpresidentiall candidate
Kim Watterson allegedlyjhad illegal access to
another candidate’s grade transcripts with-
out his permission. (Student government
candidate are required to have at least a 2.5
QPA in order to be eligible to run.)

Watterson apparently was spreading ru-
mors that Jeff Miller, another candidate, did
not meet this requirement. Miller filed
charges against Watterson withthe campus
judicial board claiming that Watterson slan-
dered Miller and had access to his personal
papers.

When it was found Miller did not meet the
eligibility requirement, he attempted a write-
in candidacy. In the end, Miller lost, Water-
son lost and, oh yeah...another candidate,
Bill Abraham, won. ,.

0 the controversy, also in 1979, over board
member-elect Walter,Burke’s overspending
the limit for campaign materials by four
cents. Recognizing an honest mistake, the
election committee generously allowed
Burke to retain ‘hisiseat. ’

0 the nasty charges against board members
in the same election for bribing engineering
students which were dropped because of pro-
cedural inaccuracies in filing charges.

0 the 1976 election challenge of presiden-
tial candidate Barry Weisband, who lost by
32 votes. Weisband said slips of paper had
been placed over his name on two voting
machines, causing cnfusion forvoters’. The
election was held a second time, with Weis-
band the victor.

It will be interesting to see how the 1981
election will turn out. It is our hope that the
election committee and the board members
will take the election seriously.

Frats Rats———-Reallyl  

Dear Editor:

1| read the article on fraternities by
Bonnie E. Thompson in the Sept. 23
issue of The Pitt News with amaze-
ment. If Louis McLinden really
believes that fraternities teach their
members to respect others, he must
have their potential in mind and not
the reality. They certainly have no
respect for their neighbors in the
Bellefield—Dithridge Street corridor.

As the neighbors of nine fraterni-
ties in the Bellefield—Dith ridge Street
corridor, we often wonder what kind
of upbringing these men had that
would lead them to tear down trees,
pull parking meters out ofthe pave-
ments, impair our safety by stealing
traffic signs and shooting fireworks
all year long, and firing at birds with
a BB gun. A little noise does not

bother us, but loud, raucous noise
and horn honking-,long after mid-
night is another matter. The litter
they leave on the streets after their
parties makes’ us feel as if we live in a
slum.

The only thing we have been able
to figure out is that because of the
large concentration of fraternities in
our neighborhood, a mob psychol-
ogy takes over that leads the young
fraternity men to engage in a type of
conduct that deviates very much
from their true characters. We,
therefore, were very pleased to hear
that the University was goingto help
the fraternities move to a site on
campus near the stadium where the
neighbors would be far enough away
not to be bothered. But now we hear
that the fraternities in our area are
not interested in moving. i

What is very disturbing to us is
that two additional fraternities have
moved’ into our neighborhood since
September. These new fraternities
are resorting to all kind of strata-
gems to hide the fact that they are
fraternities such as using portable
signs and conning the building
inspector. What is worse, some of
their alumni appear to be assisting
them in their duplicity.

Maybe we old Pitt graduates and

contributors are out of touch with
the new morality, but, nevertheless,
it is hard for us to accept the fact that
these fraternity men are going to be
the lawyers, doctors, and corpora-
tion presidents of tomorrow.

Nixon a Worthy Cause,

By LARRY LUNSFORD

There’s ahubbub going -ondown

-_at Duke University in Durham.

N.C.. concerning whether _or n-ot to
locate the Richard M. Nixon presi-
dentiail library there. The universi-
t.y’s academic council as well as

numerous alumni and students -have V

voiced opposition to the proposal.
but the university’s president, Terry
Sanford. and the board of trustees
have given a go-ahead to the',projec’t'.

The idea -to locate Duke law
school alumnus Nixon’s presidential
library came from Sanford ‘himself

several years ago when he was a .4

Democratic governor of i_ North
Carolina. lt resurfaced again last
summer when Sanford met with

Nixon in New York. Nixon and his‘

staff agreed to the proposal and was
going to make the announcement
last August until Duke faculty
members got word of the idea and
threatened action. Sanford agieed
to a postponement until the «matter
could be discussed by the universi-
ty‘s academic council. H
The academic council "discussed
the matter in two separaterneetings

; W and finally voted 35 to 34 to're'cprn—

mend that. .. ‘the negotiations ;_with

Nixon — be dropped; -V The 7fo'llo’wing.g a’
day the’-trustees’ executive i:.omr'h"it-"
I tee approvedthe negotiations"; ~_

‘ The faCult_v“s decision"  a-

bit of a su'rpri‘ise,‘and the 
the trustees to approve the'prtip_osal
is the right one. The uproar ha‘s"_v-et
to end. however. '‘

Sanford now has become a target
for irate faculty members and others
who oppose the project. They
express sentiments “that they were
misled by the university president all
along. Peter Klopfer, a professor of
zoology, commented, »“He has
misled us. he has distorted informa-
tion. and he has sacrificed his credi-
bility....lt‘s not just the Nixon
library that we don’t need at -Duke.

‘ l’m sorry -to say it. but I don't think

we any longer need Terry Stanford.”
No one disagrees with the fact that

Nixon acted rwrongly in office and -

caused a national disgrace with the
Watergate scandal. Yet we cannot
deny the fact that he was president
for 5 l, 2 years and played a major
role in shaping history in various
situations. particularly the restora-
tion of diplomatic relations with
mainland China. it is appropriate
that a library be built to house the
millions ofdocuments and memora-
bilia from the Nixon presidency, and
it ‘is appropriate that it be built on
the campus of hisalma mater.

WHAT COULD
    THE ARMY 
  POSSIBLY OFFER 
  A BRIGHT PERSON

Drop your guard fora
minute. Even though you're

but not necessarily '
assigned to active duty. Find

in college right now, there

are many aspects of the Army
that you might find very
attractive.

Maybe even irresistible.

See for yourself. ~ 

MED SCHOOL.ON U

You read it right.

The Army's Health Professions Scholarship
Program provides necessary tuition, books. lab
fees, even microscope rental during medical
school. ,

Plus a monthly stipend that works out to
about $6,000 ayear.

After you're accepted into medical
school, you can be accepted into our program.
Then you're commissioned and you go
through school as a Second Lieutenant in the
Army Reserve. .

The hitch? Very simple. After you graduate,
you give the Army a year as a doctor for every
year the Army gave you as a med student, with
a minimum obligation of three years' service.

INTERNSHIP RESIDENCY
8: CASH‘ BONUSES

Besides scholarships to medical school, the
Army also offers AMA-approved first-year
post-graduate and residency training programs.

Such training adds no further obligation to
the scholarship participant. But any Civilian
Graduate Medical Education sponsored by the
Army gives you a one-year obligation for .
every year of sponsorship, with a minimum
obligation of two years' service.

But you get a $9,000 annual bonus every
year you're paying back medical school or post-
graduate training.

So you not only get your medical education
paid for, you get extra pay while you're paying ”
it back. Not a bad deal.

A GREAT PLACE TO BE A NURSE

The rich tradition of Army Nursing is one
of excellence, dedication, even heroism. And
it's a challenge to live up to.

Today, an Army Nurse is the epitome of
professionalism, regarded as a critical member
of the Army Medical Team.

A BSN degree is required. And the clinical
spectrum is almost impossible to match in
civilian practice.

And, since you'll be an Army Officer, you'll
enjoy more respect and authority than most of
your civilian counterparts. You'll also enjoy
travel opportunities, officer's pay and officers
privileges. .

Army Nursing offers educational oppor-
tunities that are second to none. As an Army
Nurse, you could be selected for graduate degree
programs at civilian universities.

  

KE YOU?

ADVANCED NURSING COURSE.
TUITION-FREE

You get tuition, pay and living allowances.
You can also take Nurse Practitioner courses
and courses in many clinical specialities. All on
the Army. A

While these programs do not cost you any
money, most of them do incur an additional

' service obligation.

A CHANCE TO PRACTICE LAW

If you're about to get your law degree and
be admitted to the bar, you should consider a
commissionain the Judge Advocate General
Corps. Because in the Army you get to practice
law right from the start.

While your classmates are still doing other
lawyers research and other lawyers briefs, you
could have your own cases, your own clients,
in effect, your own practice.

Plus you'll have the pay, prestige and privi— .

leges of being an Officer in the United SIELES
Army. With a chance to travel and make the
most of what you've worked so hard to
become. A real, practicing lawyer. Be an Army
Lawyer.

nor: scnounsuips

Though you're too late for a 4-year
scholarship, there are 3-, 2-, and even 1-year
scholarships available. I

They include tuition, books, and lab fees.
Plus $100 a month living allowance. Naturally
they're very competitive. Because
besides helping you towards your
degree, an ROTC scholarship helps
you towards the gold bars of an
Army Officer.

Stop by the ROTC office on

out about it.

ABONUS FOR

, You can get a $1,500

bonus just for enlisting in some Army Reserve

units. Or up to $4,000 in educational benefits.
You also get paid for your Reserve duty. It

comes out to about $1,100 a year for one weekend

a month and two weeks annual training.

And now we have a special program to help

you fit the Army Reserve around your school
schedule.
1t's worth a look.

  A szcoun CHANCE AT coma: I

Some may find college to be the right place
at the wrong time for a variety of reasons The
Army can help them, too. v

A few years in the Army can help them get
money for tuition and the maturity to use it
wisely.

The Army has a program in which money
saved for college is matched two—for—one by the
government. Then, if one qualifies, a generous
bonus is added to that.

So 2 years of service can get you up to
$15,200 for college, 3 and 4 years up to $20,100.
In addition, bonuses up to $5,000 are available

‘ for 4-year enlistments in selected skills.
Add in the experience and maturity gained,

and the Army can send an individual back to
college a richer person in more ways than one.
We hope these Army opportunities have
intrigued you as well as surprised you. Because
there is indeed a lot the Army can offer a bright
person like you.

The Inside Story

“Pitt — A   Rainbow

Are midterms, phone bills and
your roommate’s Barry Manilow
albums starting to get to you?

Then take» heart. because next

week’s homecoming events will be a

welcome relief.-

Sponsored by the Pitt Program
Council (PPC), Homecoming 1981
will provide l4 varied events spread
over six days for Pitt students.

This year‘s events have been tak-
ing shape since mid-March with the
help of more than 30 people and will
cost an estimated $33,000 according
to PPC Homecoming Com'mittee
Chairperson Susan Dillingham.

“The word homecoming is a mis-
nomer,” says Dillingham. “While
alumni will participate, our events
have been planned with Pitt students
in mind."

The big problem with planning
homecoming is trying to project the
traditional idea of homecoming and
school spirit, while at the same time
trying to diversify the events to
attract a large number of "students.

“A lot of thought went into this
year’s homecoming theme, ‘Pitt-A
Rainbow Connection,’ ” says Dil-
lingham. “it best expresses the idea
behind events designed to appeal to
all students."

Dillingham credits PPC member
Bonnie Thompson for the theme——
borrowed from Jim Henson and his
frog, Kermit, as well as from Jose-
phine Baker.

Baker, an ’ American entertainer
who organized a spy network in
Marseilles during the Nazi occupa-
tion of France and later received the

The Pin News, Wednesday, October /4. I98]

 

Medal of Resistance with Rosette
for her work, adopted l’2 children of
varied backgrounds and singlehand-
edly raised her “rainbow children”.

 

“Our university embraces l,50O
students and faculty from over'l00
countries in addition to the thou-
sands of its own_ ‘melting pot’ of
American students, faculty and
staff," writes Dillingham in a home-
coming handout. “These people are
the essence of this college. Thus, we
believe ‘A Rainbow Connection‘
and its implications best exemplifies
our university‘s most important
resource—its people.”

Below is a day—by-day breakdown
of events comprising Homecoming
l98l: “Pitt——A Rainbow Connec-
tron.“

Tues.,
Oct. 20

Many students look forward to
Pitt‘s homecoming events. but some
do more than othersfsuch as candi-
dates for king and queen.

This bonfire culminates a homecoming pep rally.

Voting for king and queen will be
the opener for this year’s homecom-
ing events, with voting scheduled in
the following places and times: Tow-
ers Lobby, ll-6;’Student Union, I l-
4; Cathedral (Ground Floor), ll—4;
Victoria Hall, l2—3; Benedum Hall,
l2-4; and Lothrop Hall, ll-2.
Hall, ll-2.

Candidates in this year’s king and

_ queen contest give several reasons»-

ranging from “a lot of fun" to “a
chance to meet people"—— for
running.

“it's good public relations for the
organization you’re representing,”
says one potential queen. “Having a
representative run for such an
esteemed position is not only good
PR, but it also keeps an organiza-
tion visible to the student body and
possibly evokes more student
interest."

“Running for king gives other
people a chance to get to know who I
am,” says a candidate for king. “i
like to meet people through school
activities."

Another candidate for queen says
she thinks it is “a shame only a few
people" can be king or queen and
adds that it would be “nice ifanyone
could be nominated." According to
the contest rules only a junior or

‘senior with a QPA of 2.0 or better

who can find a student organization

‘sponsor can run. _ ,
Another candidate defends the

contest from charges of being out-
dated. 0

“I think many students think run-
ning for king and queen is corny."
she says. “But when you’re involved,
it's an honor."

Regardless of the reasons why
candidates run, students have a real

° incentive to vote because the PPC is

giving a unique surprise gift to eve-
ryone who votes.

According to PPC member Rose
Parish, student organizations will

delectable treats as cookies. brown-
ies, and the All-American hotdog

A campus skate for the more
adventurous will be held during the
carnival. and skates can be rented by
the hour from 5 to l() p.m._The pop-
ular country grass» band, Castle-
man‘s Run, will provide live
entertainment from 8 to l0:30 with
the announcement of the king and
queens court at 9.

Fri.’,
Oct. 23     .

Friday will start out with fun and
games when one of the week’s most
popular events, the keg roll competi-
tion, gets underway at 2 p.m. on the
Cathedral Lawn. i

There are 32 four-person teams
registered for the event, which
involves among-other things rolling
an empty keg across a grease slide
and catching water balloons with a
bucket tied around the neck.

“This year we‘re got a nice mix-‘

ture of teams that include both girls
and guys, as well as groups like the
Greeks and wrestlers," says PPC
member Loretta Petretti. “it's going
to be a crazy time."

Stroh’s is the co-sponsor of the
competition, providing the kegs and
t-shirts for participants. its first-
place prize of fourengraved pewter
mugs will be awarded on Saturday
morning when the top four battle it
out in the finale. 

The traditional parade, complete
with bands. clowns and fire trucks,
follows the afternoon's games at 6.

According to Dillingham and
PPC member Dave McMasters. the
parade is the most time-consuming
event to plan because of the red tape
involved in obtaining a parade per-
mit from the city. Arrangements
must also be made with the police.
and coordination of participants in
the parade and the way they will line
up is an extensive task.

This year's parade will be led ‘by a
grand marshal, who has not yet been
named, and will include I5 floats,
Pitt’s race car team’, three dorm
banners. Shriner clowns, fire trucks,
two bands, the Pitt Unicycle Club,
and the homecoming court and
Chancellor Wesley Posvar in con-
vertibles.

Parade participants will organize
in front of Hillman Library, proceed
to Roberto Clemente Drive and con-
tinue along the route by turning
right onto Bouquet Street; right
onto Forbes Avenue: left onto Belle-
field Avenue: left onto Fifth
Avenue: and finally left onto ()ak—
land Avenue.

Disbelief is the initial reaction of this 1955 Pitt homecoming queen crowned in front of
the tootball crowd of 56,000. ‘ '

After 7'/3 months of planning, it
would seem as if everything-should
fall into place. McMasters is quick
to point out, however, that there are

' some things a parade organizer can

never plan for.

"I remember a few years ago when
an ambulance came rushing through
the parade.” he says. “Floats had to
pull over to the side, and the Pitt

let it through.”

The autumn night may or may not
be filled with ambulance sirens. but
it will certainly be filled with spirit
football coach Jackie
Sherrill and his players give their
predictions on Saturday’s game
against Syracuse at a pep rally fol-
lowing the parade at 7 in Forbes
Quadrangle. Randy Miller and
Dave Thomas. disc jockeys for
9tiKX and Pitt‘s WPGH, respec-
tively, will host theevent. The home-
coming king and queen will also be
crowned-during the rally.

Following the naming of the king

and queen. another celebration beg-
ins with a Street Dance, also_ in
Forbes Quadrangle.

-“This is a new addition to home-
coming." says Dillingham. who

 explains that t_he dance will be infor-

mal with disc jockey Jeffers Brown
playing records. “We feel it will be
successful in drawing a lot of
students.“

While there isn‘t a bonfire to go
along with the pep rally, the ﬁre-
works at l0:30 should be a perfect
substitute. The fireworks display
will cap off a full and. ifthe organ-
izers have their way. successful

Next, Pitt's Panthers take_ on Syr-

because, according to one source.
the Orangemen—with a‘ record of
I-3-l—-will not be much of a chal-

P lenge for the Panthers.

 

Despite the fact that Syracuse’s
senior halfback Joe Morris has
broken many of the school‘s rushing
records once held by such football
greats as Larry Csonka and Floyd
Little. the game is predicted to be
one-sided. and ‘Pitt should chalk up
another mark in the win column.

Homecoming events‘ continue
into Saturday night with the Pablo
Cruise and Atlanta Rhythm Section
concert in the Syria Mosque begin-
ning at 8.

Although each ofthese groups has
its own drawing power, the PPC
concert committee decided that the
two groups would “co-headline” to
attract more attention and students
to the concert. 5

“They meet our goal of providing
a balanced program. We didn‘t want
a group that was extremely special-
i7ed for homecoming." says Ed Kel-
ley, PPC concert committee
chairman. “Both groups take in a lot
of styles and should attract a diverse
group of students",

Atlanta Rhythm.Section has con-
tracted to open theconcert with one

Cruise has agreed to follow with a
two-hour set for $l5:000.

Although $25,000 seems like a

hefty ‘sum to dish out for one~con- A

cert. Kelley says the cost is reasona-

gblegespecially since both groups’

new albums are on the charts.
“The price is relatively cheap con-
sidering the fact that, on the average.
most popular groups command over
$40,000 for a college concert,” says
Kelly. . 1 8
With only 3,800 seats in the Syria

on the concert with ticket prices at
$5 for Pitt students and $8 for oth-
ers; however. Kelley says money-

making is not the purpose of the
concert.

“We gauge success not in the
terms of money. but in how well.
attended the concert is by students,“
he says. “Our purpose is to provide
students with entertainment that
they cannot see anywhere else in
Pittsburgh at the same price.”

Sun.,
Oct. 25

Winding ‘down the homecoming
festivities will. be the homecoming
formal. The formal will be held’ on
Sunday at one of Pittsburgh’s well-
known and exclusive restaurants,
the Park Schenley.

According to PPC member Susan
Pecuch. tickets will cost $25 per cou-
ple and the price will include two
complete meals and entertainment
by the Parker Brothers.

The formal. which is the‘ only
semi-formal dance that is open to all
Pitt students, will be held in Oak-
land this year for convience.

“There was talk of not having one
this year because past homecoming

formals haven‘t been that success-

ful,” says Pecuch. “But it’s a good
way to end homecoming and the
closeness of this year‘s formal
should attract more students."

Tickets will be on sale Oct.ﬂl’5, l9
and 20 in the towers lobby during
lunch and dinner. A limited number
of tickets will also be available from
the Student'Union Ticket Office.

Pitt Seeks Revenge Against FSU

By JOHNETTE HOWARD

One year later. the memory still
stings——the undefeated season.

major bowl bid. national champion-
ship and seven turnovers that

slipped through the hands ofthe Pitt

Panther football team last October
ll on a warm, muggy night in Talla-
hassee, Fla.

Though they scarcely needed it, a
simple reminder for this year’s Pitt
team was scrawled ‘on the locker-
room blackboard when prepara-
tions "for the formidable Florida
State Seminoles began this week.
The message read: 36-22.

Saturday, the rebuilt but nonethe-
less revengeful Panthers eagerly face
Florida State, looking to even the
score.

“We owe them.” says senior Pitt
fullback Wayne DiBartola. '

“This game is just another step-
ping stone toward our goal of being
undefeated.” DiBartola said. “But if
there's one team I don’t want to lose

’ to, it’s Florida»State.”

“That (game last year) is the one
that stopped us from winning the
national championship.”

Which. week by week, grows
more and more likely for the unde-

feated. third-ranked Panthers as
they continue to climb the Top I0
rankings and close in on a chance at
the title. An honor that last year’s
team. so overloaded with experience
and NFL-caliber talent, missed by
an eyelash.

Again the obstacle’ is Florida
State, a 4-] team on a roll, sporting
consecutive road victories over Ohio
State and Notre Dame in the last
two weeks. Unlike.last year. how-
ever, the Seminoles will not suffer
from a lack of respect when they line
up against the Panthers at Pitt Sta-
dium Saturday.

“We went down there last year a
little on the lax side and some things
happened that we didn't expect to
happen," Panther tailback Bryan
Thomas said yesterday. “We’re

_looking at it different this year.

We’re unbeaten and we want to stay
unbeaten. They have to play here
and under our crowd." , -

Florida State Coach’ Bobby
Bowden. former head man at West
Virginia, knows what entering Pitt
Stadium can be like when yourteam
isn‘t exactly on good terms with Pitt.
He acknowledges that revenge will
be a big factor when the two teams
meet. Bowden says he's also ditched

have experienced the
incessant din of the South Carol-
ina crowd and the frenzied,
whooping screams of the West-
Virginia faithful this year. Now.
the Pitt Panther football team
would like to see how a Pitt
crowd stacks up with the best of
the noise-makaers.

The game with Florida State.
the Panthers’ toughest foe ofthe
early season is looming ahead
Saturday at Pitt -Stadium. To
help combat the Seminoles. the
Pitt band, cheerleaders, Pitt
Athletic Boosters Club and

including Pitt Coach Jackie
Sherrill. are joining forces to
rally support for the Panthers.

Groups Join to
Spur Pitt Fans

members“of the football team. .

They’d like the Oakland com-
munity and everyone associated
with Pitt, students especially. to
help make Florida State’s visit
here a memorable one. And one
the Seminoles would rather
forget.

All this week. the Pitt athletic
department is asking Pitt foot-
ball aficionados to make their
presence felt by displaying
banners. signs and posters in
support of the Panther team.

Thursday, the Pitt band will
join the Pitt Athletic Boosters
Club (a student group that
includes fan groups like Puzzuli’s
Pigs and Sal Sunseri’s Brigade)
in an informal pep rally in the
Schenley Quadrangle. Also

any hope for the types of surprises
the Seminoles sprang on the Pan-
thers last year.

“I think last year Pitt took us for
granted down here." Bowden said
yesterday in a phone conversation
from his Seminoles’Tallahassee lair.
“This year. there’s no chance ofthat.
We expect to face a fired up. l00
percent Pitt football team.”

While Bowden says he expects
Pitt’s appetite for revenge to figure
in Satu_r_day’s contest. Pitt Coach
Jackie Sherrill is trying to play down
his and the team’s desire to avenge
last year’s loss. The loss that
deprived him of his first national
championship as a coach.

“I don’t have toplay.” Sherrill
said and grinned. “Theirevenge fac-
tor is not as big as people think. We
have a different team. if we had the
same people back. it might be more
of a factor."

Which is a notion that Pitt line-
backer Rick Kraynak’s comments
debunked.

“lt’s a different team that’s start-
ing. but all of us were second and
third stringers last season. The only
difference is we're starting now. We
remember the game last year.“ l(ray—
nak said. “We’ll be extra fired up to

Pitt Goes 0-3 onlRoad Trip

By ROBERTA MIRLIE

Despite several close matches and
an all-out team effort. the Lady
Panthers tennis team suffered three
losses this past weekend, all on the
road.

Friday‘s 6-3 loss to Villanova sig-
naled the beginning of Pitt‘s trou-
bles. the first of which was Randi
Belkin’s muscle pull in her left thigh.
In her No. l singles match against
Carol Harrison, Belkin defeated
Harrison 6-l in the first set and was
up 3-2 in the second when she suf-
fered the injury. However. Belkin
braved the discomfort to capture a
6-4 victory. ‘ A

At No. 2 singles, Cathy Jacobson
defeated Villanova’s Trish Styracker
6-0. 6-2 in what Coach George Dief-
fenbach called “great tennis on
Cathy‘s part.” ,

“Cathy won easily and played
great all weekend." Dieffenbach
added. “She beat a lot of good
people.”

The three remaining Pitt singles
entrants all lost. much inithe same

tournament, will face stiff competi-
tion from teams such as Illinois
State, Louisiana State, Texas A&M

. and Illinois.

“We will be competing against a
basically strong field ofteams, all of
which are relatively strong and solid
like Pitt,” said Pitt Coach Shelton

p Collier. “There are no weak teams or

standout teams in the tournament;
therefore, any team could win or
lose all of their matches and the out-
some would not be real surprising.”

According to Collier, the key to
winning for Pitt will be performing
consistently at an above—average
level. At the Ohio State Classic last
weekend, Collier said the team
“began to turn the corner in that
respect."

“Against OSU, weistarted playing
with the intensity that had been
missing in our previous efforts this
year," Collier said. “We're hoping to
pick up where we left off at Ohio
State and not allow ourselves to slip
back to the lackadaisical form we
displayed earlier in the season.”;

This weekend, the Lady Panthers
will be lacking an important part of
their offense due to the absence of
senior setter Maria Perez, who Col-
lier said is out with a “fairly serious”
knee injury.

‘ “We hope to compensate for her
loss with excellent serving and get a
big tournament out of (Junior set-
ter) Julie Gaul,“ Collier said. “Until
now Maria and Julie have been shar-
ing the setting position, but this
weekend we will be relying on Julie
to set for thetournament.”

The starting lineup that Pitt will

stay with most ofthe time this week-.
end will include seniors Paula Olsen

and Linda Stadler,juniors Gaul and

‘Diane Zack, sophomore Robin
Kukalis and freshmen Judy Young.

“I’m very satisfied with the way
Judy Young has come along,” said
Collier. “Judy has been playing part-
time so far this season, but she will
start in place of Perez.

According to Collier, the Lady
Panther team is confident yet a bit
apprehensive about this weekend’s
tournament.

“It should be interesting and chal-
lenging to see how we do since we
haven’t seen any of the other nine
(participating) teams this year,”Col-
her said. “Traditionally, Texas and
Illinois produce stronger volleyball
teams than the Eastern teams, so we
know our competition is good.”

The Illinois Invitational will alsc
be one of the top two tournament:
that Pitt will compete in this year.

The next home matches for the
Lady Panthers will be Tuesday, Oct.
20, when they host West Virginia
at 4:30 pm. and Cleveland State at 8
p.m.

The Pitt News, Wednesday. October 14, /98]

By -AMIN GHOSSEIN

The Pirates road back to respec-
tability will not come from the free
agent market. Pirate Executive
Vice-President Harding Peterson,
informed National League Presi-
dent Charles Feeney Tuesday that
the Pirates will not participate in the
drafting of “Type A” ranking play-
ers. The Pirates will not be subject to
playing players in baseball’s free-
agent compensation pool.

The Pirate’s move brings up sev-
eral interesting. points. First and
foremost, it seems obvious that the
Pirates will try to rise via the trade
route. With a.depleted minor league
system and aging players. the Pirates
only quick—help is the trade market,
a choice that has been mentioned by
Peterson all along.

Peterson’s task is a tough one.
After fielding a championship club
just two years ago, the Pirates fin-
ished in last “place in the second half

. _of the I98l season.

The team’s fall was a team effort
and Peterson's turn to trade route to
obtain help will have to deal with
several areas. To acquire the talent
the Pirates need, Peterson is going to
have to give up talent, something
they can‘t really afford to do.

With Type A players like Ken
Griffey, Reggie Jackson, and several
quality pitchers available in the free
agent draft, the Pirates decision has
to be viewed as financial. With lag-
ging attendance, and one of the
highest payrolls in baseball, the
Pirates have been chronic money
losers for years. A plunge into the
free agent market could ‘further
deepen the Pirates money problem.

Peterson has to also think about
signing two free agents from this
year‘s team—- Bill Madlock" and
Jason Thompson. If the Pirates
want to become competitive again,
it’s crucial that they can sign Mad-
lock, this year‘s batting king, and
Thompson, a player who has to play
everyday to be effective.

In the waning days of this season,
Thompson showed what he can do

at the plate. And it was no ﬂuke. He.

has averaged 96 runs batted in a year
before coming to Pittsburgh.
The sinkiﬁfg of Madlock is proba-

bly more likely since the third base-’

man has expressed a liking for the
Pirates ahd .especially‘ manager

‘ .-

I7

  Pirates Say No
Free-Agnt Dralt  

Harding Petersori

Chuck Tanner. With Thompson, 'it’s
another story. , ,

The first baseman had been pla-
tooned all year and expressed ‘his
dissatisfaction with the situation.
For him, it would be more beneficial
to go to a team that could use him
daily rather than stay here and play
only against right-handed pitching.

The move is, a logical one by
Peterson. Ifthe Pirates aren’t willing
to shell out big bucks to signthe big
stars then why should they lose play-
“ers in compensation? They still
might lose players, however.

The rule, which was part of the
agreement to end the strike, states
that if more than five teams express
the same sentiment as the Pirates
then a lot shall be drawn to deter-
mine which five teams can remain
compensation—free.

Teams like Cincinnati or Los
Angeles, which have never
expressed much interest in the free
agent system, will probably take the
same route as the Pirates. But these
clubs are pennant contenders with
healthy fa rm systems and the Pirates

"are not right now.

Peterson's stand does not exclude
the Pirates from drafting Type B
players. But the top -players are in
the “A” category and the Pirates
have to lay their hands off. Is therea

reason why the Pirates are disdain- »
ing these players besides money‘? Ed -

  Hall Scores High

 

 

By MARIE HUFF
As the saying goes, the competi-
tion keeps getting better all the time.

The Pitt Lady Panther field
hockey team, discovered that yester-
day, losing a 5-l game to Davis and
Elkins at Pitt‘s Trees Field.

Davis and Elkins, a Division I
powerhouse, is- currently ranked
l3th in the nation. The loss dropped
the Lady Panthers’ record to 4-5-2
with only one game remaining.

at The Davis and Elkins’fancy stick-

work froze Pitt as the visitors easily
shot past the mesmerized Lady

Panthers for a 3-0 halftime lead, Pitt '

finally hit pay dirt in the second half
on a Dee Dee Kantner goal. Kantner
ﬂicked the ball in on a penalty shot
for Pitt's only score. Davis and
Elkins came back to put two more in
the cage in the half to seal the
victory. ’

“I really felt we were going to
score again near the end of the
game," said Pitt Coach“Cindy DiGi-
acomo. “They were an excellent
team, and I think we did a fine job
against them.”

 The Lady Panthers must win their

final match, a home contest against
Kunztown, ‘in order to go .500 for
the season. Kunztown, another of
the many powerful teams rooted in
[the East, should be a formidable
opponent.

Pitt. on the other hand, seems to
rise to meet a challenge better at
home than on the road. The Lady
Panthers are particularly tough on
the home turf, where they have lost
only one match this season.

We’re expecting a tough, exciting
game to end the season." said DiGia-
como. STICK PIX: Bill Curry and

Funny. The idea of a slaughter is

Pirates Pull
From Draft

r'ontI’nued_/'rom page seventeen

Wadde. publicity director of the
Pirates. indicated yes.

“At the present time, we do not
feel that the players in the draft right
now could benefit our ballclub.” he
said- But what about five years down
the road?

Wadde would not saythis-without

i talking to Peterson first. The stra-

tegy may well be right. The Buc’s
most pressing need is in the pitching
department: The pitchers who are
free agent are obviously not to the
Pirates liking. With Thompson at
first. ifthey sign him——and Peterson
is no doubt gambling that they
will—-and impressive rookie Johnny
Ray at second, with either Dale
Berra or Tim Foli at short and Mad-
lock, once again if they sign him. at
third, the Pirates infield is set.

Tony Pena’s season at catcher has
establishedihim as an untouchable
while the outfield of Mike Easler.
Lee Lacy. Omar Moreno and Dave
Parker is also set, provided Parker
stays in Pittsburgh]

Set for now, that is. Chuck
Tanner and Peterson feel that they
have a competitive starting eight,
and with a few trades for some qual-
ity pitching, a sorely needed com-
modity, the Pirates could climb back
into baseballs’ elite. a position they
are accustomed to be in‘.

Can they do it. without the free
agent system‘? Yes, but it won’t be

Parker. whose had some below-par

drawing card among major league
managers. When not injured. Parker
is one ofthe most dynamic players in
the game, so Peterson’s asking price
will be awfully high.

The upcoming winter is as crucial

year. he has relied more on skill and
less on his size and strength. This has
helped him to become a better
player.”

Although Hackworth is a main
cog in the Panther defense, he has
also aided in the scoring attack with
two goals this season.

“They’re the first goals I've ever
scored at Pitt.” said Hackworth. “It
felt pretty good."

That's saying a lot when you con-
sider all Hackworth has accomp-
lished in his soccer career.

_j‘When I came to Pitt, 1 just
wanted to start,” said Hackworth.
“Now here I am. team captain and a
kind of team leader. I think some of
the players look up to me at times.”

Especially the younger players.

“I really look up to Hack.” said
freshman Dan Zemanski. “He‘s
always up for a game. He doesn’t let
the team get down. If it looks like
we're down_ on the field; Hack really

tries to fire us up. Besides. it’s his
size. He's a bear.”

“I respect and admire Hack."

added sophomore Nick Wilson. “lt’s .

because of his high level ofintensity
on the soccer field."

Hackworth has won the respect of
his coach. too.

“I named Hackworth as one ofthe
team captains because he is a person
that can lead the team,“ Bemis said.
‘‘He’s a leader on the field during a
game. Hackworth is a good, mature
individual.”

The Pitt soccer team will need
_Hackworth’s leadership when it
faces Youngstown State today at
Youngstown. Ohio. Pitt beat
Youngstown in anyindoor tourna-
ment this spring, but today's contest
will mark the first’ time the two
teams will meet outdoors.

Youngstown had been struggling
due to injuries to key players,
according to Bemis. but Pitt will
catch them at full strength.

“Youngstown is a good team.” he
said. “They have some good players.
with their strength being up the
middle."

Pitt‘s recent troubles have been
due to their lack ofa scoring attack.
Hackworth agrees and believes this
hurts the defense.

“We‘re playing good defense.
said Hackworth. “but we could be
better. If we score. the defense plays
better because we’re under less pres-
sure. Right now. we’re moving
farther up the field, trying to pick up
the slack. We‘re tiring ourselves
out.”

Bemis would like to see the return
of the scoring attack in today’s
game.

“Wehave to get the ball around

the goal,” he said. “and shoot more.”

As a senior. who will graduate
with a major in math and computer
science. there’s no doubt that Hack-
worth would like to seethe Panthers
have a winning season since his
soccer careerwill probably end here
at Pitt.

“I really enjoy playing soccer. but
I don't think l’ll continue to play
(after I graduate).” said Hackworth.
“I've had a good time playing soccer
and I like what We done."

to new players and a new coach. but
I feel the transition has been a good

ONE.

One thing hasn't changed—- -Dee
Kantner. Sue Shaheen and Dee Hall
still continue to dominate the offen-
sive attack.

“Playing with Sue and Dec has
been great. We’ve learned a lot
about the game from each other,”
Hall said. “Our familiarity with one
another’s style has enabled us to

maintain a consistent scoring drive..

Our freshmen ‘now show potential
and hopefully their experienceithis

team next year.“

After the team’s final game this
Friday against Kutztown State, Hall
