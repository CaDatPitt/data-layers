Webster Closes Today, But Students tp Remain Until Fall

By SUE McFARLAND
Pitt News Staff Writer

One of Oakland’s long-standing landmarks, the
Webster Hall Hotel, which houses some 170 Pitt
students, will close its doors for the last time today,
allowing its transformation to luxury apartments.
Students housed at the hotel will, however, be allowed
to remain until the end of the term while rennovation
is in progress.

Pitt began housing male students at the Webster
Hall some years ago in a move to supply housing at
University prices to students who otherwise would
have been on a waiting list as a result of limited
dormitory space. A similar arrangment was made
with Carlow College for female students.

At present, a total of 380 students are housed at the
two alternative locations, according to director of
housing Donovan Hughes.

“Our options are still open as far as Carlow goes,”
Hughes said, “and the students at Webster Hall were

Pro-Strikers Denied Posvar Parley

ByPA_TTY TASCARELLA
Pitt News Staff Writer

A coalition of ‘25 Pittsburgh service. and religious
organizations seeking a resolution tothe sixaweek-old
strike by workers at Western Psychiatric Institution
and Clinic (WPIC), were refused talks with Pitt
Chancellor Posvar Wednesday morning on the
grounds that discussion would hamper current
negotiations.

At first denying, and then admitting the Chancellor
was in the Cathedral of Leagning,, an aide to Posvar,
Dr. James Hunter, told the group of about 20 that “to
open another dialogue at this point would not help
negotiations. ’ ’

Coalition head James Ferlo said that since the
hospital connected to the University, Posvar should be
made aware of conditions for patients, because the
strike has severely limited the hospital staff.

“The chancellor would like the public to believe he
is not involved with negotiations,” Ferlo said. “He
has arrogantly refused to hear our concerns.”

Ferlo and the coalition claimed the University is
racist, because it denied educational benefits to the
WPIC staff, which is 70 percent black.

The group also distributed a ﬂyer written by.a WPIC
staff nurse that detailed what was termed
deteriorating conditions at the institution.

The ﬂyer said the strike has led to an overworked
staff that includes several untrained members, thus
heightening the chance for serious injury. Sanitation
is poor, according to the ﬂyer, and roaches have been
found in in-patient units. Food quality has gone
down, the ﬂyer said. It also said instruments_like
vacuum cleaners with long cords have been left in
reach of patients considered to be suicidal.

permitted to take part in room bidding with the bonus
of being given senior status regardless of their actual
year in school because they were displaced students. ’ ’

Hughes has offered an option to more than 500
upperclass students who lived on campus this year
who did not have the right to participate in room
bidding this year because they failed to pay a $100
deposit before the 2,300 person limit was reached.

‘ ‘Last week we sent out about 240 surveys to female
students on the waiting list, asking them if they would
be willing to accept accomodations at Carlow. As of
yet we have received about 30 percent of the surveys
back, most of which are negative,” Hughes said.

To offset the loss of the Webster Hall spaces, the
University will have approximately 476 new residence
units by way of Bruce Hall and Forbes Pavillion,

which, when completed, will house 244 and 232.

candidates in the area. Those we support will be ones
who are sympathetic to higher education.” 0

Park, former GPR chairman Mark McKillop and
board member Stan Galanski are in Harrisburg today
for a press conference with Allegheny County Senator
James Romanelli. Romanelli is expected to issue a
statement of support for state-related universities.

Chancellor Posvar is also in Harrisburg, where he is
testifying before the state Senate Appropriations
Committee.

In other SGB business, the board appointed Park,
Galanski and board member Dave Hesidence to the
Pennsylvania Student Association of State-Related
Universities’ (PSASRU) board of directors. PSASRUB
is the student lobbying group for the four state-related
universites. Representatives from Pitt, Penn State,
Temple‘ and Lincoln will meet at Lincoln University
Sunday.

Hotel Webster Hall, located on Fifth Ave. and serving the area as a landmark for
decades, closes today, but still will provide Pitt housing, at least until Fall term.’
Webster, along with Carlow College, housed an overflow of Pltt resident
students in recent years, but will be converted into an apartment facility.

A report reviewing Pitt’s academic future
(1980-90) prompted several faculty assembly
members to express concern Wednesday that
assembly views were not suitably conveyed in
the proposal, but moved nevertheless to send it
to the administration for consideration.

The report, which called, in part, for better
recruitment of students, more on-campus
housing and possible, contruction of a new
student union facility, topped discussion at the
Assembly’s Wednesday meeting.

The report should not be considered as an
ofﬁcial University plan, but rather as personal
relfections on what should lie in Pitt’s future if
it is to continue to function efﬁciently,
according to Provost Rhoten Smith, who
co-authored the report.

Citing the need for an improved recruitment
program, the proposal suggests Pitt’s largest

gdisacl_v.a.n.tage.rt1ight.,be an f‘.imag_e problem’? . ,

among the public high school guidance
counselors and, administrators, who are in the
position to recommend colleges and univer-
sities to prospective students. Also stated in
the report is that in the past, the positive
characteristics of Pitt have been ignored or left
unknown in many instances, causing severe
damage to existing recruting efforts. .
According to ﬁndings by the University Task
Force on Honors Admissions and Recruitment,
the Ofﬁce of Admissions has fallen short of

generating effective recruiting programs _

relying instead on unsolicited applicants to fill
the undergraduate slots.

The task force believes the 5,000
undergraduate applications received last year
can, and should, be increased to include more
high-achieving students, despite the decrease

in the total number of high school seniors this a

year. Upon receiving these suggestions from
the group, the Office of Admissions
implemented, some Changes, in recruiting

methods, with more changes to follow.

The report also offered directions as to the
future of University housing. It was also stated
that some joint action should be taken by the
vice chancellors of planning and budget and
public affairs to remove obstacles to new
student housing in the area. The mentioned
obstacles included location, ﬁnancing and
political problems. The shortage of on-campus
housing was mentioned as a foremost priority.

Construction of a building to function as a
student union and commuter center (featuring
facilities designed especially to meet the needs
of the commuter, and a continuing-education
center for seminars and workshops) should be
considered, according to the report, to make
the campus more attractive to the prospective
student.

If the construction of an entirely new facility
proved to be financially infeasible, the report
suggested an alternative of rennovating the
existing Student Union. ’ T

Distinguished Lecturer
Talks DNA Politics

By GAIL M. SIMMONS
Pitt News Staff Writer

Dr. Paul Berg, a Wilson professor of biochemistry at Stanford
University, spoke on the dangers of recombinant DNA research and the
social and political issues that have surrounded attempts to regulate
such research in his ﬁnal lecture of the Distinguished Lecturer Series
yesterday.

Calling recombinant DNA research “the most widely reported and
publicized issue of our or any other generation,” Berg recounted the
history of the issue from its 1971 roots.

At that time, Berg, who was engaged in some preliminary
recombinant DNA work, decided to temporarily discontinue his work,
because he could not satisfactorily answer arguments by some
colleagues that his research might be dangerous.

When, in 1973 at the Gordon Conference on Nucleic Acid Research,
the first successful recombinant DNA experiments were announced, a
special session was called to consider the possible hazards of such
research. The result was a letter to the president of the National
Academy of Science, requesting a special study of the problem.

As more successful results in recombinant DNA were publicized, the
National Institute of Health (NIH) formed its own committee to study
the situation. This committee made the interim recommendation that
two types of research be deferred: construction of artiﬁcially
drug-resistant bacteria and introduction into bacteria of known
carcinogenic viral DNA. This so-called moratorium was not a ban on
recombinant DNA research, as the media implied, Berg said, but
merely a recommendation. Reasearch not involving these types of DNA.
continued.

In July of 1976, the NIH enacted a set of guidelines for recombinant
DNA research. These guidelines, which are mandatory for any
research funded by the United States Government, speciﬁy the
precautions that must be taken in various types of research with
recominant DNA. Experiments of varying degrees of hazard must be
appropriately contained by both physical and biological means.

Physical containment involves the construction of special laboratory
facilities for recombinant DNA research. Biological containment
requires the use of organisms in these experiments that are not viable
outside of the laboratory and therefore cannot harm other organisms.

The NIH guidelines, Berg said, deal only with the possible health
hazards of recombinant DNA research. Issues such as the possible use
of recombinant organisms for biological warfare, creation of new
organisms and significant alteration of higher organisms such as man,
are “not scientiﬁc issues, but serious political and social issues”
according to Berg.

Berg expressed some reserve about bills presently before the Senate
the House that would impose federal control on all recombinant DNA
research in the United States. He is concerned that legislation may
become ingrained and may severely limit future research. Of especial
worry is the possibility that the preemption clauses of the bills, which
would prevent state and local governments from passing additional
legislation in the area, may be struck from the bills. V

“I sincerely doubt such legislation is necessary,” Berg said. “The
NIH guidelines provide a code of practice that all scientists will
follow.” _

Berg criticized, the press for its “wholesale sellout to
sensationalisni.” |

“They want to~ give? the public something scary to begin and end its
day with,” Berg said, pointing to examples of press hyperbole in such
headlinesas “The“DNA Furor: Tinkering with Life” and “Playing God
with DNA.” The latter magazine headline was placed over a picture of
a serpent twisted into the characteristic double spiral structure of a
DNA molecule.

Berg admitted that the search for new knowledge is not risk free.

“The answers (to the research questions) are not known, so all
precautions are a matter of judgment,” he said. “The best society can
do is to be appraised of the facts and make decisions baséd on
judgment and those facts.

“Man has been in the act (of modifying the life around him) since he
came down from the trees,” Berg said. By breeding hybrid varieties of
corn and developing special strains of yeast for brewing, man has
changed living organisms in his environment.

Webster Hall Hotel Closes

(Con tinued from Page I)

“This does not mean that we are
going to have an excess of housing
for the coming year, by any
means,” Hughes said. ‘When we
add the additional students from
Webster and Carlow we really only
have about 53 more accomodations
than last year.”

According to Hughes, converting
Webster Hall to apartments has
been at the discussion table on
several occasions over the past few
years. .

“We weren’t caught off guard
with the closing even though we
were just officially notiﬁed last
month.” Hughes said. “This was
in the back of our minds all the
time.”

“But, our move to rennovate
Bruce hall and Forbes Pavillion was
not only because of this. It was
basically just a move based on our
overall increased housing needs.”

Some discussion has been raised
concerning the fear that the $2
million Bruce Hall rennovations
might not be completed before the
fall term opening of school.‘ '

‘ ‘I really think it’s a little too early
to get frightened about anything
like that. The contract was drawn
up for August 15, but, we are
working on alternatives if some-
thing like this should arise,”
Hughes said.

In the mean time, Pitt residents of

organization, serves to centralize

groups on campus.

Also, board member Jan Medoff
announced that meetings with

Math Changes In, Bio. Changes Doubtful--CAS Council

By DAVE KIRSHNER
Pitt News Staff Writer

The College of Arts and Science Council unanimously
approved new course changes in the math program, but
appeared ready to reject a similar request by the biological
sciences department during yesterday's Council session.

A proposal to create four new courses within the math
department passed by a 9-0 margin. Although it did not
officially vote on the biological science’s measure, the
Council’s reaction in preliminary discussion showed strong
opposition. 3

Negative reaction to the plan, which is asking for a
reduction in the number of laboratory courses offered in the
biological science core sequence, stems from it’s
functioning “possibly at the expense of undergraduates.”

“Teaching assistants have been cut back in the
proposal,” said CAS Dean Robert Marshall. “It would
result in cutting back their work hours.”

Council members said that merging lab courses at the
freshman level into lab sections from sophomore-level
lecture courses to form one distinct class would aid the
department, but not "students.

The council reviewed the math proposal, however, as
being aimed _toward student needs.

“The methods we’re using in the basic math program
aren’t working that well, ” explained mathematics chairman
Wilbur E. Deskins. “We’d like to try a program similar to
the .type used at Harvard._”

“We would add two two-credit courses—Math 3A
Algebra and Math 3B Trigonometry,” he said. “They

would offer material at a slower pace than in Math 3. The
courses will be taught in small classes with peer
instruction.”

Two additional courses, Math 23X and 24X, are proposed
to be worth one credit each, and will apply calculus, learned
in already existing classes, to particular ﬁelds of interest.

Assistant department chairman of biological sciences Jim
Franzen’s request is distinct from any part of the math
program’s alterations. His justification for the proposal to
cut down lab courses centered on increasing costs and the
decline in enrollment in the graduate program.

“There’s a crunch,” Franzen said. “We can't afford it.
We’ve had a cutback in TA’s by Dean Rosenberg at FAS.
We do want them (the TA’s) to devote more time to do
research.”

I I An Equal Voice

Candidates for replacement of Robert Marshall: dean of the
College of Arts and Sciences, are being reviewed by a search com-
mittee of four members appointed by the chancellor, four faculty
members and two students electedgby the Student Government
Board.

To ﬁnd an adequate replacement for Dean Marshall will require
an Olympian feat. Another man who supports free-form
curriculum, which allows students to structure a personal
education, and one who wants to insure teaching excellence is the
University's focus, may be difficult to find. V

For the search committee to insure a worthy replacement for
Marshall is found requires that they have some effect on the chan-
cellor’s decision. If it does not, the committee serves an ad-

ministrative purpose only, weeding through the flock of applicants
to discover a final list of three to six candidates. Without this
power students and faculty, who should share equally in the selec-
tion process are not given enough voice in the appointment I
procedure.

Unfortunately, the present design of the search committee fails
to permit adequate input from faculty and students. Present
guidelines make the committee responsible for evaluating applican-
cants and submitting to the chancellor a list of potential can-
didates—in alphabetical order—without ranking candidates “by
preference in any fashion. ”

Prohibiting ranking by preference greatly lessens the impact the
search committee has on selection of Dean Marshal1’s replacement
by giving Chancellor Posvar tremendous discretion in the final
selection. Groups most affected by the appointment--students and
faculty—have negligible relative input.

To correct this problem, the search committee guidelines must be
redesigned. Students, faculty and administrators should have
equal input by allowing equal numbers of the three groups on the
committee.

Coupled with this change should be an amendment allowing the
listing of the suggested candidates in preferential order. Certainly,
the chancellor should have some input on the selection process, but
provisions allowing him to reject all candidates or to choose one of
the three to six possible candidates despite committee preferences
gives him almost total control of the process. Until these reforms
are made, the search committee has only superficial effect on the
replacement of deans, a vitally important area shaping Pitt’s

have something worth hearing to
say for themselves,” he would
apply the opening quote to
everyone, including Nazis.

Which brings us to Skokie, Ill.,
and the proposed march of
American Nazis through a town
with a large Jewish population. The
thought of such a march gives one a
chance to debate the difference
between Millian philosophy and its
ability to reconcile itself with
practical reality.

Whether the Nazis should be
allowed to parade through Skokie, a

‘city whose inhabitants include
survivors and children of victims of
the Holocaust, is the question being
debated. Nothing can be done to
ensure that Nazi thought is forever
removed from people’s minds-—
there will always be the sick among

perrnitted—by law, if necessary-—
to assemble is becoming a
knockdown, drag-it-out ~ﬁght with
far-reaching repercussions.
Understandably, the town of
Skokie said no, and passed
ordinances preventing the march.
The American Civil Liberties Union
came to the aid of the Nazis, and has
led them to victorious court

  PERSUASIONS

decisions overturning many of the
Skokie ordinances. In a move that
has cost them thousands of
members, the ACLU is arguing that
to take away the right of Nazis is to
endanger the rights of all. It may be
correct.

In “On Liberty,” Mill articulates
four grounds on which freedom of
opinion and expression should
exist. The list comprises four of the
best reasons why the Nazis should
be permitted to walk through
Skokie.

The first reason is, “If any
opinion is compelled to silence, that
opinion may, for aught we can
certainly know, be true. To deny
this is to assume our own
infallibility. ’ ’

While few rational humans would
say the beliefs of Nazis are true,
people must be careful when
suppressing any opinion. Opinions,
even the most destructive, vile and
repugnant, must be aired if the
word freedom is to _have any
meaning. If the Nazis are

stippressed today. W119 is to know_ its message and the moral lepers

whether, say, the Democratic Party
will be suppressed 100 years from
now?

Secondly, “Though the silenced
opinion may be an error, it may, and
very commonly does, contain a
portion of truth; and since the
general or prevailing opinion on any
subject is rarely or never the whole
truth, it is only by the collision of
adverse opinions that the remainder
of truth has any chance of being
supplied.”

A This is the key principle for the
Millian arguing this case. While
few are saying Nazi belief has any
truth to it, it is only by hearing and
seeing their position that one can
rationally argue against it. This is
the main reason one must hear all
faiths and beliefs. Only by under-
standing adverse ‘opinion can we
feel safe and justified in the
knowledge our tenets are correct.
To ﬁght against the expression of
dissenting, even dangerous, opin-
ions, is, as has been said, to assume
our own infallibility.

Thirdly, “Even if the received
opinion be not only true, but the
whole truth; unless it is suffered to
be, and actually is, vigorously and
earnestly contested, it will, by most
of those who receive it, be held in a
manner of a prejudice, with little
comprehension or feeling of its
rational ground.”

No one can afford to have a
vicious belief such as"Nazism to be
less than fully understood. It can
only be understood if it is out in the
open, unsuppressed and free to
exist. Only then, when people see

, being
deprived of its vital effect on the

who teach it, will they turn against

it, and the suppression‘-will be
self-imposed.

Fourthly, “The meaning of the
doctrine itself will be in danger of

lost or enfeebled, and

character and conduct; the dogma
becoming a mere formal profession,
inefﬁcacious for good but cumber-
ing the ground, and preventing the
growth of any real and heartfelt
conviction, from reason or personal
experience.” ’

May we ever afford to let the
effects of Nazism escape us? Only
by allowing the promulgation of
Nazi beliefs on a small scale can we
ever hope to prevent a recurrance of
Nazi beliefs on a Hitlerian scale.

[ax

ﬁt

The march i,n._Skoki.9 doejs n9t

signal the beginning of a new
movement that could lead to a

second Holocaust. By allowing the
march , we will be helping to prevent

a repeat of that European atrocity.
But to achieve this, people must
watch the parade and see the faces
of those onlookers, and we must try
to remember as they remember.
But we can only do this by
permitting the march, and watching
it, goosestep by sickening goose-
step.

“There i5‘ always hope when people
are forced to listen to both sides; it is
when they attend to only one that error
hardens to prejudice. and truth itself
ceases to have the effect of truth, by
being exaggerated into falsehood. ”

Pitt News Staff Writer
Rock and Roll Music From The
Planet Earth
Country Joe McDonald

It's back to the drawing board for
Country Joe McDonald, who has
yet to produce a top-selling album
since his hit performance at
Woodstock. The newest release by
his group, “Rock and Roll Music
From the Planet Earth,” doesn’t
have much to offer.

Although the album comes
nowhere close to the excellent
engineering as was done on Steely
Dan’s award-winning “Aja,” the
album is well-mixed, and Country
Joe does have a couple of good
songs.

The problem with the album is
Country Joe himself. All the songs
have potential, yet Joe doesn’t
have the voice to provide a break in
the monotony of songs. He offers a
nasal sound somewhere between
Bob Dylan and Neil Young, and he
sounds the same, song after song.

Side one offers four songs, and
the first is probably the best on the
album. “Coyote” begins with an
excellent musical introduction. The

Q vocals and strings remain good,

and the song is similar in verse to
Michael Murphy’s “Wildﬁre.” ‘
“Bring Back the Sixties Man” is
the second song and is the ﬁrst
track bearing resemblance to the
album’s title. This song is live, and
sounds like it could have come from
“Woodstock.” It could be a slow
disco, and provides some good
nostalgic lyrics about the 1960’s.
Side one doesn’t get any better
as it progresses into the last two

ARTS

songs, “Sunshine Through My
Window” and “Rock and Roll
Again.” The former has a good
piano intro, and the music far
outdoes the vocals. The title song is
a good rock and roll tune with
excellent backup vocals by Lisa
Roberts, but Joe’s idea of rock and
roll music from the planet earth
seems to defy categorization.
Side two features basically the
same tempo. The side starts with a
slow number and gets progress-
ively worse. “Darkship” is a good
tune with‘ a message. Joe says

“We've all got to lose in the end.
We’re riding in a Darkshipfheadin’
out across the bay to ﬁnd a better
way.” Joe is the one to lose here.

“Y-O-U” is a-spelling tune with
a little touch of soul. It’s the kind of
song we remember the Tempta-
tions performing while dancing the
continental. Perhaps we can expect
the Silvers to pick up on this
number.

As the album rambles on, the
piano impresses us more. “South-
ern Cross” is similar to “Sunshine
Through My Window” on side one,
but it brings back Lisa Roberts with
good background vocals.

Of course every album seems to
have its dead ringers as losers, and
this one has two. “U.F.O.” and
“Space Patrol” should be included
in K-Tel Records “Goofy Greats.”
The former is a ridiculous song
with absolutely no meaning, while
the latter is a slow tune about a
space patrol in the Milky Way.
Both songs deﬁnitely complement
the album title.

“Get It Together” wraps up the
side and the album. It ranks as the
second best song after “Coyote.”
At least the album starts good and
ends on the same note.

Tracksters Heading for Virginia To Open Outdoor Season

ByMARIASCIULLO
Pm News sun Writer

Pitt opens its outdoor track
season Saturday against eight
teams in the Virginia Relays.
Although temperatures have not
been particularly inviting out on the
track this year, like it or not, six
relay teams plus a number of
athletes entered in individual ﬁeld
and distance events will be
prepared to compete in anything
short of a blizzard.

‘ ‘We’re really not training toward
meets just yet,” said assistant
coach Dan Sullivan. “We are going

Tankers “Disappointed” by Nation ggResu|ts

ByKAREN KADILAK
Pitt News Staff Writer

The Pitt swim team, coming off
one of its best dual-meet season
records in history, and a strong
ﬁrst-place showing in the recent
Eastern Regional Championships,
had high hopes going into last
week’s NCAA Championships at
Long Beach, Calif., that at least
one of its swimmers would make
all-America.

As it turned out, such optimism
was unfounded. None of the eight
swimmers—Jeff Trew, Mickey
Termin, Dave Civis, Orlando
Catinchi, Mark Schuman, Bob
Greenwald, Stu Swanson and diver
Scott Winkler—eamed such dis-
tinction during the three-day meet.

“We were disappointed,” coach
Dick Bradshaw said. “We thought
all our guys had a realistic chance
at making all-America after the
seasons each one of them had. It
wasn’t that we didn't swim well.
All the guys had good races. It just
wasn’t good for the kind of
competition that was out there.”

With the top 12 ﬁnishers in each
event making all-America, Schu-
man was the Pitt swimmer closest
to earning such recognition. The
freshman from Philadelphia ﬁn-

ished 13th in the 100-yard
butterﬂy.
Swanson, with a 15th-place

ﬁnish, was shut out from the same
recognition in the 200-yard back-
stroke.

“Although none of our guys
made .a1l-America, we were still
pleased with the way they swam,”
Bradshaw said. “We had two
individuals (Schuman and Swan-
son) and three relays teams
(400-yard freestyle, 400-yard med-
ley, and 800-yard freestyle) qualify

into competition with our athletes at
the stage where they’re still
working very hard during the week,
with no slacking off just before a
meet. This week we’re trying some
men in different events, and others
in races they have never tried
before.”

Freshman Randy Bailey will
attempt his ﬁrst steeplechase ever,
while Dave McDonald will run 5000
meters. Others competing are Pitt
indoor record-holder Gene Roach in
the pole vault and high jumper Dan
Goodyear, Panther record-holder in
the outdoor event, and top 20

among the top 20. So, it was still
one of the strongest showings
we’ve had in a long time.”

Bradshaw said one of the major
problems that not only his
swimmers had to face was the
shallowness of the pool at Long
Beach.

Unlike last year’s championships
at Cleveland State, which produced
record-shattering performances in
almost every event, no records
were so easily broken by any of the
teams that competed in the meet.
The shallow pool was one of the
major reasons.

“The pool was slow because it
was shallow,” the Panther coach
said. “In a shallow pool, the water
doesn’t move out of the way like it
does in a faster, deeper pool. You
think you’re swimming faster until

. vou look at the times and see that

Y0ll’re really going slower. I think
that bothered some of the guys.”

With the exception of long-
distanct man Trew, all Pitt times
were down from those posted in the
Eastems.

Trew, who consistently placed
ﬁrst in the long-distance events for
the Panthers during their unde-
feated dual-meet season, had his
best time of the year before
suffering a cramp midway through
the 1,650-yard freestyle.

The cramp, Bradshaw con-
tended, could have shut Trew out
from a shot at all-America.

‘ ‘It was difficult for him to breath
after he got that cramp,” Brad-
shaw said. “If he had maintained
the pace he had in the beginning of

the race at the end, he just may"

have made all-America.

Sophomore Winkler, competing
in his ﬁrst NCAA Championship
meet, ﬁnished 27th in the diving
competition.

Sports

finisher in the 1977 NCAA
championships.

Goodyear’s opponents this week-
end include Brian Melly, a
Maryland jumper who has cleared 7
feet, 2 inches this year.

Distance men Mel Boyd, Tom
Herrmann and Gary Siriano are part
of both the four- and two-mile

relays, with Mark Studnicki and
Rich Moore ﬁlling in the remaining
spots. Herrmann, winner of the
mile run in January’s Pitt Indoor
Invitational, believes his relay
teams should do well.
“Talent-wise, there’s going to be
sortie pretty good runners from
schools like Penn State” Herrmann
said, “but I think we’re pretty good
ourselves. We’ve all run longer
distances this year, and I think in
the two-mile relay we’re going to be
in better shape physically than
some of the other teams that
comprise mainly half-milers. ’ ’

Backstrokr Stu Swanson conctts efro 200-yard roe.

Dave Hensen,'Larry Shippen and
Keith Leckenby compose three-
fourths of the 440 and 880-yard
relay; Shippen and Leckenby will
also run the mile relay along with
Bud Cooper and Greg Conover. The
distance’ medley relay will be
staffed by Roger Winstanley (880),
Cooper (440), Jack Cade (3/4 mile)
and Dan Dattilo (mile).

. Stonewalled Hockey Club Seeks New Funding Options

  
   

Pitt’s hockey management, which, through prac--

tice, has become a professional organization at
‘talking itself blue in the face, has finally realized the
futility of reasoning with a wall.

The wall. in this case, is the school’s athletic de-
partment, which has stood ﬁrm since the hockey

club’s inception five years ago, and has recently been-

dropped from the club’s list of potential financial
sources for next season. Club members decided that
ﬁve financially wasted years, five years of empty
bargaining (and consequently, empty budgets) and
five years of having their words bounce back to them
was uselessness enough; the time had come, they
figured, to probe other, more porous, alternatives.

“I think clearly that they (the athletic department)
are not interested in helping us,” said Dr. Harvey
Wolfe, the hockey club’s faculty advisor, who, along
with club president Alex Sanchioli and Nancy Evans,
Pitt’s assistant director of student activities, decided
to discontinue the fruitless efforts.

“We’ve given up on the athletic department,”
Wolfe said. “We’ve exhausted all channels.”

And the channels have been many. Beginning with
athletic director Cas Myslinksi’s promises of five
years ago and ending with this year’s denial by the

_ University Athletic Committee, the Pitt Hockey Club
has seen enough red tape to "never want another

Christmas present. But that is the least of its worries;
hockey presents are undoubtedly on the bottom of
the athletic department’s Christmas list. Even that
subcommittee, formed (mostly as a pacifier) by the

‘University Athletic Committee to seek “alternative

   
 

Q ..... .. _
funds” for the hockey program, has yet to be heard
from. »

So with athletic department money out of the
question, and with other possible sources, which
Sanchioli and Wolfe are currently looking into, un-
certain, the logical question is simply: Will there be a
hockey team next year?

“Only if the Student Government continues its
support,” Wolfe said. “And we’d like to have a
committment from them as early as possible, like
next month or so, so we can start devising next year’s
schedule.”

 

Although Student Government has been more than
generous over the years, being the club’s sole means
of financial support, a threat presented itself earlier
this year, and must be considered—-SGB monies could
be trimmed. Despite club efforts to minimize
operating expenditures--costs such as for travel that
could be cut by joining a league in which the most
distant game would be in Ohio--an SGB cutback
could prove fatal, especially since that money will
decide whether the Panthers ever take another
faceoff.

“I can’t say if the hockey club’s allotment will be
cut or not,” said SGB member Jan Medoff,
“because our priorities haven’t been set for next
year. I can’t speak for the entire board, but per-
sonally, I don’t think funding will be cut.

“It’s unfortunate that the athletic department
won’t support the club,” Medoff said, “and I think
it should, but until it does, it is Student Govern-
ment’s responsibility to do so. Hockey is something
a lot of people are interested in, it is one of the most
visible student activities on campus, and besides, they
have a good team.”

All promising words,‘ words that have left San-
chioli with high hopes.

“We will definitely have some kind of season next ~

year,” Sanchioli said. “I hope.”

Haupt Off and Run

ByKARENKADILAK
pm News sun Writer

Call it beginners’ luck, or a knack
for breaking records, or just plain
and simple skill. Whatever you call
it, Pitt women's track star Lisa
Haupt has it.

Twice in the past ﬁve years, the
freshman from Bellwood, Pa., has
set records in events in which she
has never previously competed.

It happened again this past
January. Preparing to compete in
her ﬁrst collegiate meet, Haupt was
asked by Pantherette coach Al-
freeda Goff to run the 440. Although
it was her ﬁrst try at the event, the
ﬁrst-term freshman promptly went
out and smashed the Pitt indoor
record with a time of 59.4, a clocking
she was to better in last month’s
Eastern Regional Championships.

A similar thing happened to
Haupt ﬁve years ago. Asked by her
coaches to compete in the long jump
moments before the meet, Haupt,
showing the form that would make
her state champion in the event four
years later, took a few practice
jumps, then proceeded to shatter
the team record.

Haupt has a simple explanation
for such ﬁrst-time success, and it
isn’t beginners’ luck.

“It’s faith,” the freshman said.
“Ifit weren’t for God, I wouldn't be
doing what I’m doing now. He gave

me the ability to run. It's my
responsibility to use this ability to
run a good race.”

It was a similar faith and love of
running that led Haupt to come to
Pitt this January after working and
being out of track for six months.
Deciding that track may have been
too big a part of her life, Haupt
declined several track scholarships
and took a job at a savings and loan
association in her hometown last
summer.

She worked there until coming to
Pitt this term.

‘ ‘I kind of let myself go during the
summer,” she said. ‘ ‘I was going to
go to nursing school in the fall, but
at the last minute I decided not to
go.

“I wanted to see what my life
would be without track,” Haupt
said. “I had spent ﬁve years in the
sport. Running from eighth to 12th
grade, I was averaging about three
meets per week for ﬁve years. It
was getting to be a little tiresome.

‘ ‘I felt I needed a change, so Itook .

the job in Bellwood,” she
continued. “I didn’t run at all. But
while I was away from it, I really
missed it. It was then I realized that
doing it was something. I really
wanted to do, or I wouldn't have
done it in the ﬁrst place.”

Haupt decided to stop running
after she captured ﬁrst place in the
long jump at last spring’s state

ning After Layoff

ﬁnals (she also picked up second-
and third-place ﬁnishes in the 220-
and 100-yard runs in the same
meet).

‘ ‘One of my main goals was to win
the long jump,” Haupt said.
“When I won that, I didn’t think
there was anything beyond break-
ing that record. But I found out
otherwise this summer. There’s a
lot more to work for.”

Haupt has yet to compete in the
long jump at Pitt. During the
Pantherettes’ recently completed
indoor season, the freshman ran in
both the 440-yard run and the
880-yard medley relay. She is
expected to compete in the same
events when the Pantherettes open
the outdoor portion of their
schedule next Wednesday at
California State.

“I’d like to do the long jump
here,” Haupt said. “But right now
I don’t think I want to do it badly
enough. I’m still starting to get the
feel of things in college track. I
don’t think it would be wise for me
to compete in another event,
especially now that I’m competing
in the 440.”

If and when Haupt gets the
opportunity to compete in this
event, chances are another Pitt
record will go down the chute.

Call it beginners’ luck, a special
knack, skill or faith. Whatever it is,
Haupt has an awful lot of it.

Pitt Netters Swing into Action Winning 11rree of Five

ByJIMPANE
Pitt News Staff Writer

The Pitt tennis team, its season
in full swing, netted tnree ot ﬁve
road matches in Virginia last week
to better last year’s winless effort
south of the Mason-Dixon Line.

Visiting ﬁve campuses in as
many days, much the same as they
did in last season's trial southern
tour, the Panthers saw various
levels of competition.

After facing the likes of
Lynchburg and Roanoke, which
became 9-0 victims on Tuesday and
Wednesday, respectively, Pitt fell,
8-1, to last year’s NCAA Division
III runner-up, Washington & Lee.
The Panthers rallied to overcome
Ranford, 6-3, however, then
concluded the trip with Saturday’s
5-4 loss to George Mason.

Pitt, which opens its home
season today against California

State (2p.m. at Trees Courts),

"survived without the services of its

number-four and -ﬁve men, Tom
Gault and Chuck Brand. The slack
there was picked up by Doug White
and Tom Kepner, who were
interchanged at the number-six
singles slot, while George Hoffman
and Joe Mayers moved up to
number tour and ﬁve, respectively.

“We went down there with a
weak team,” said coach George
Dieffenbach. “We probably could
have done much better with a full
squad.”

A lack of depth in the four, ﬁve
and six singles slots, along with
weak doubles play, areas in which
Dieffenbach predicted there would
be trouble, became somewhat
evident in the last three matches;
the Washington & Lee blowout not
withstanding,_ steadier play in
those anchor positions could have

possibly swayed some results.

“It seems that a lot of work
needs to be done in doubles play,”
Dieffenbach said. “There is no
sense of team work yet, and they
aren’t aggressive enough. They’re
not moving to the net quick
enough.”

Just as Dieffenbach’s preseason
depth predictions became truths,
so did his views of team strengths;
Tom Liebenguth, Bill Pilardy and
Kevin Quay, the Panthers’ one-
two-three punch, each lost only one
singles match throughout the
week.

“In many respects, the trip was
comparable to last year’s,” Dief-
fenbach said, “even though we
played ﬁve different teams.”

And the fact that Pitt won three
of its matches this trip, after failing
to capture a single victory last
season, has nothing to do with the

team’s relative improvement, Dief-
fenbach contends.

“I won’t say that we have more
talent,” he said. “In fact, we’re at
about the same level as last year.
But we do have more togetherness
and team unity. We’re a better
team attitude-wise.”

Pitt’s opening-match landslide
over Lynchburg wasn’t as easy a
burial as the 9-0 score might
indicate. Four matches went the
three-set limit, but Hof_fman’s and
White’s singles efforts and the
Hoffman-Quay, Mayers-Kepner
doubles combos-prevailed, and the
Panthers had their ﬁrst dual-match
win of the season. (They teamed
with the Pantherettes earlier this
month to capture the Pittsburgh
Invitational Challenge Cup.)

Traveling to Salem, Va., a day
later, the Panthers met‘ their
easiest challenge of the trip in a

Roanoke squad. As a result, Pitt
gained its second straight 9-0
decision.

From theweakling to the giant,

Pitt buckled under Washington &

Lee’s talents, 8-1, the same result
the teams played to ‘at the end of
last season. One consolation for the
Panthers was Liebenguth’s 6-3, 7-5
win over Benjamin Johns, who beat
the Pitt co-captain (10-4) last year. ’
“That was one of the best
matches I’ve ever seen Tom play,”
Dieffenbach said. “Johns ham-
mered him last year, so that shows
how much Tom has improved.”
Quay, the other Panther co-
captain, sprained his ankle during
a Washington & Lee doubles match
that he and Hoffman were winning,
forcing Pitt to default. Quay
returned, however, to beat his
Radford and George Mason singles
opponents later in the tour.

Rivera Seeks Some Proof fr t Gennan Technique

By BOB LABRIOLA
Pitt News Staff Writer

First there was the space race,
then the arms race, and now the
United States is feverishly trying to
catch up with East Germany on the
front of sports medicine.

Since sports medicine in the
United States has comprised little
more than taping ankles, the
President’s Commission on Olym-
pic Sports has called for a program
to “apply lessons of the laboratory
to achievement on the ﬁeld.”

Dr. Alois Mader is one of the
pioneers of a revolutionary training
procedure known as the lactate-
acid testing system. Mader, before
defecting to West Germany in 1974
from the East, had been the top
sports doctor at Chemie Halle,
home club of retired swimming star
Kornelia Ender.

This training system is of special
interest to members of the United
States swimming community, since
it is said to have taken most of the
guesswork out of training. East
German doctors use computerized
blood test results to determine the
athlete’s most efficient training
pace. Using certain probability
equations, doctors can increase the
training rigors to coincide with the
body chemistry, and even predict
an athlete’s future performance.

Miguel Rivera, Pitt’s water polo

coach who is currently doing a

5

doctoral thesis on the procedure,
explains, it in this manner: “A
blood test is taken prior to a
workout to determine a normal
lactate count. The athlete then‘
performs eight repetitions of his
event at 60 to 70 percent of his best
time. After the workout, blood
samples are taken at regular
intervals until the lactate count
returns to normal.

“There is a second set of eight
repetitions of the event, this time at
90 percent of the athlete’s best
time, making sure to keep a
constant pace,” Rivera continued.
“Then we take the highest lactate
values in each of the two workouts,
and either identify or predict the
speed the athlete must attain to
accumulate .004 moles of lactate
per liter of blood.”

This rate of speed (.004 moles of
lactate per liter) is called the
anaerobic-aerobic threshold, and
training should be done at this
level.

East German doctors have
concluded that participants in
repetitive motion sports should
avoid intense, high speed (anaero-
bic) exercise. Common _training
methods consist mainly of a series
of sprints with short periods of rest
in between, which is just what East
Germany has abolished.

Anaerobic exercise causes se-

vere oxygen debt, because it

MIGUEL RIVERA

requires more oxygen than the
body can efﬁciently utilize. East
Germans believe a shift to the
slower, steadier rate of exertion
(aerobic rate) would lead to better
performances, and also reduce the
risk of injury. '

“After the athlete trains at the
prescribed pace for a few weeks,
his tolerance to lactic acid in-
creases,” Rivera said. “He then
undergoes the bloodletting proce-
dure again to determine a
stepped-up routine.”

“Our men are the world's best,

:~

and a large chunk of their work is
anaerobic,” said Bob Bartels,
former swimming coach at Ohio
State. “Are we supposed to
abandon what we’re doing just like
that?”

Dr. G.R. Greenwell, 51-year-old
chairman of the AAU sports
medicine committee, has become
the premier proponent of the test in
the United. States.

“Our approach to training has

been to go till it hurts, and then

keep on going,” Greenwell once
said. “When the concentration of
lactic acid becomes excessive, the
athlete, can no longer produce
energy efﬁciently, which is why
limits should be set on training.
The East Germans were the ﬁrst to

devise formulas to determine

limits, and as I see it, this has been
a major key to their success.”

When the demand for energy on
muscles is greater than the amount
of oxygen taken into the body,
lactic acid is produced. When
muscles undergo periods of oxygen
deﬁciency, the tissue becomes
damaged causing contractions and
cramps.

“You always hear coaches
talking about a tapering off period
before a meet,” Rivera said. “This
is caused by prolonged periods of
strenuous exercise, and the mus-
cles need rest before they can

perform at top efficiency again.”

Dr. Irving Dardik, chairman of
the United States Olympic Sports
Medicine Committee, has decline‘?
a request by Greenwell to
collaborate on lactic-acid testing
until the whole Olympic program is
worked out.

“We do plan to review the
lactic-acid business,” said Dardik,

“but I suspect you can ﬁnd out the
same things by measuring oxygen
consumption or running treadmill
tests, which we’re. doing. ’ ’

“I can find more positive results
from lactic-acid testing than from .
oxygen consumption,” Greenwell
said. “Taking the oxygen measure!’
does nothing to change or improve
a training program.”

“You can’t take one thing and
say that is the answer,” Dardik has
said. “The guy (Greenwell) is a
promoter.”

“Dardik wants to be the whole
show,” Greenwell answered.
“He’s afraid if anyone else gets
involved, it will lower the height of
his own pedestal.”

“I think these tests may show
that we do overtrain some of ou§‘V[’};
athletes,” said Mark Schubert,-5”
coach at the Mission Viejo Swim
Club. “The point in training is an
individual thing, and this could

help us tailor workouts to suit each
athelete ,. ”

£y_'l‘l'.~e Associated Press

CLEARWATER, Fla. — Ken
Macha, the ex-Pitt Panther, isn’t
interested in whether the baseball
owners go through with their
gentlemen’s agreement to reduce
National League rosters from 25 to
24 players.

“Whether they keep 22, 23 or 24,
it makes no difference to me. I
should be one of them,” claimed
Macha, who is battling for a job with
the Pittsburgh Pirates.

Macha made three trips from
Columbus in the Triple A Interna-
tional League to the parent Pirates
in 1977. In 35 games with the Bucs
he hit .274 and batted in 11 runs. He
played third, first and the outﬁeld.

Of all the young players the
Pirates moved up during the 1977
season, and after the minor
leaguers completed their sched-
ules, Macha, if you believe
statistics, did the best job.

“I feel I deserve a chance to
play,” said Macha, an engineering
graduate from Pitt, who was born in
Wilkinsburg, Pa., but now calls
nearby Monroeville his home.
“Maybe I'm a little bold, but the
others got a chance and didn’t do
the job I did.”

0, Macha stood on the sidelines just
be

fore a spring exhibition, and as
positively as he could make the

Macha Sure of Landing Buc lob

words sound, he said, “I think I
should be in.” He certainly can't
see the advantage of another season
in Triple A, where he hit .335, with
11 homers and 64 RBIs.

Macha, a 27-year-old who stands
6-foot-2 inches and ﬁlls out a
muscular 217-pound frame, be-
lieves he has the versatility to make
him a valuable utility performer for
the 1978 Pirates. He also can catch,
which would give manager Chuck
Tanner a third receiver for game
strategy.

The springs have been big
disappointments for Macha, who
has been a Pirates fan since he was
old enough to understand baseball.
He recalls seeing the first game of
the 1960 World Series, which the
Pirates won in the seventh game”
on Bill Mazereski’s last of the ninth
inning home run.

One spring he thought he had the
Pirates’ squad made, when on the
day before the team headed north to
open the season, the Bucs acquired
Bill Robinson from the Phillies.
Macha was sent down to Charles-
ton. Last year he was having a fine
spring, when his father died. He
went home for the funeral. When he
came back, he found another ticket

waiting to the minors.

pick in the 1972 free agent draft

(Excerpt-Mclieasport Daiy News Wed. Aug. 24, 1!“)
Divorced Man Gets Right to See Dogs (San Jose, Cal)

after a standout baseball career at
Pitt, recalled he was recommended
highly by a friend who worked in the
club's front ofﬁce at the time. He
was signed as a catcher.

“I look at myself and can't help
but feel there are so many ways I
can help the Pirates,” Macha said.
“I realize it means sitting on the
bench more than playing, but if
that’s what I have to do, it's worth
it.”

Has Tanner given Macha any hint
of the player’s status?

“Ah, you know Chuck, he
encourages everybody,” Macha
said.

The contested divorce case of Leroy E. Anderson, 29 San Jose and his
wife, Linda Ann, 19 was settled Tuesday when the husand was granted ‘
visitation rights to the couple’s two French Poodles.

Superior Court Judge George H. Barnett should be congratulated In his
concurrence to the right of Mr. Anderson to GO TO THE DOGS. it was nice
that the order included the right of the divorce husband to visit ‘TINA,’ the
little doggie belonging to his ex-wife and divorcee, Mrs. Anderson. Of
course, his visit with ’TlNA’ might prompt Judge Barnett to reconsider his
action since Mrs. Anderson may become jealous of the affection that her
ex-spouse offers his little doggle"T|NA.”

This Is the Pitts, Folks!

THE PITTS, our first annual

personalities and institutions,
none of which are truly deser-

rate.

The following interview took place
between a 5 th Ave reporter and a
squirrel on the Cathedral lawn; The
squirrel refused to give any iden-
tification, but admitted he was one of
the mobile bands of furry mammals
who bite Pitt students.

Q: Why are you biting Pitt students?
Is it a matter of impulse?

A: Of course not. Our bites are plan-
ned and deliberate. We are attempting
to make a statement.

Q: What kind of statement?

A: A political one, of course. We are
angry and when squirrels get n

 

  

 

come naturally to squirrels?
A: Are you kidding? That stuff makes
me want to puke.

Q: What do squirrels like to do?

A: Oh nothing special. Sit around,
put on some old Alvin and the Chip-
munks records, get high, and play with
our nuts.

Q: Squirrels smoke dope?

A: Oh, sure. I used to trip. But once, I
dropped some acid and jumped straight
out of a 40-foot tree. I thought I was
Rocky the Flying Squirrel. For two days,

 

A. Yes. It's not all flips and thrills,
you know. No one ever invites me to
parties. I'm starting to feel used.

Q. Do you get depressed?

A. I often feel like just another disc
in the machine. Without my trademark, I
don’t think anyone would care about
me.

Q. Do you have many friends?

 

A. No. I tried to befriend an Atwood
Street wino once, but he mistook me for

they 6bite.'Sor’n time “we”
from trees, too. But that's barely as ef-
fective.

Q: But why are you angry?

A: Well, if you really want to sink
your teeth into the whole matter, we
squirrels are sick and tired of getting
stepped on by students.

Q: You mean in the figurative sense;
that is, you don’t like being pushed
around. .

A: No. I meantstepped on. You

know, with Fry boots and penny loafers. -

Why, one day, a comrade of mine was
walking across the lawn minding his own
business when some Joe Blow jock just
walked across his tail. Do you know
what it feels like to have your tail
stepped on?

Q: No. What's it feel like?

A: It feels none too good. So we
aren’t going to take it anymore.
Squirrels have dignity too, you know.

Q: Do you plan any activities other
than biting and acorn dropping?

,A: Oh, yes. We’ve already broken
several clauses in our University con-
tract. For example, the cute clause.

Q: The cute clause?

A: Yeah. The university drops so
many nuts a year for us if we sit up and
be cute. So we beg for nuts, chase
each other up trees, all that kind of stuff.

Q: You mean all those things don’t

  

that
tivism now.

Q: Have you sought any advice
about political activities from campus
groups, such as the Anti-imperialist
Student Union, SCATH or the Commit-
tee to Defend Paul Nyden?

A: Are you kidding? We want to win!

Q: Any demonstrations planned for
the near future?

A: Oh, yes. Next month, were going
to have a rally on the Student Union
lawn, with a band and everything.

At this point the unidentified squirrel
sat up, smiled sweetly at the reporter,
then bit off a piece of his cheek. As the
reporter covered his wound, the squirrel

   

bounced away screaming: Squirrels.

unite!

The following interview took place

near a hedge on the west Cathedral
lawn. Our 5 th A ve reporter stopped to
rescue what it thought was a squirrel
from some wicked brambles. It turned
out to be a frisbee—and one that had
more personality than most Pitt stu-
dents we met.

‘Q. How does it feel to whiz through
the air, tossed from hand to hand, never
knowing your destination?

A. Not much different than a Pitt
student feels during registration.

Q. You seem to lead an active life.
Are you ever lonely?

 

 past. I'm  myta H

aU.F.O.

Q. What about hobbies?

A. I thought about skydiving, but
that's too dangerous. -

Q. Do you take an interest in campus
politics?

A. Once I grazed at the Chancellor's
eyebrows. It was supposed to be a
kamikaze mission.

Q. What went wrong?

A-. I changed my mind when I
realized I had been thrown by some
Commie professor who couldn't even
get tenure. I wasn’t born to be a
Molotov cocktail, you know.

Q. What are your future plans?

A. I was going to float around here
until after graduation, but to hell with my
full scholarship and my communications
major. I think I'll take off soon and never
come back. You won't have this
Frisbee to toss around anymore.

While wandering around the
Cathedral of Learning, our 5th Ave
reporter spotted a bemused character
standing near the ground floor
elevators. He carried several University
catalogues and course description
booklets under his arm. He appeared
lost and after some minutes we ap-
proached him and offered some guid-
ance.

Q: You appear to be lost, can we
help you with anything?

    

A: Yes, I'm trying to find the advising Q

center on the ninth floor, but none of the
elevators seem to stop there. They go
to the eighth floor and the 10th, but not
the ninth. :

Q: Oh, so you're an undergraduate
advisor?

A: Well, that's what the University
pays me to do’.

Q: Perhaps you can answer a
question for us then. What exactly is
the purpose of the distribution of
studies requirements?

A: Idon’t know.

Q: Oh. Well, what if you have a G
grade, an incomplete. How long do you
have to finish the required work?

A: ldon’t know. Might be one term,

might be two. .

Q: Where could we find someone
who would know the answer? Would
someone in G-1 7 be able to tell us?

A: Isn't G-17 the crosstown bus ‘to
Shadyside? I suppose you could find
someone on the bus who would know,
but it's not likely.

Q: What are the qualifications to be
an advisor?

A: ldon’t know.

At this point, the advisor entered an
elevator, and pushed the button for the

36th floor. 

Q: Where are you going now?
A: Up, I guess.

While browsing through the food co-
op in the Student Union, one lucky 5th
Ave reporter happened upon this
celebrity.

Q: Why, excuse me.
Anita Bryant?

A: Why,yeslam.

Aren’t you

FRANKS

Q: Well, what are you doing here at
Pitt?

A: I’m giving a guest lecture-in a
political science class, introduction to
oppression and bigotry.

Q: And you found yourself down

the food co-op?

A: Yes. I came down to check out
the fruits. And the oranges. You know,
I'm starting a new national campaign
against homosexuality and we’re going
to need lots of oranges.

Q: Just what is the nature of this
campaign?

A: Well, it's a three-step program.
(Bryant picked up an orange and
squeezed it tenderly.) I love ’em when
they're mushy. Anyway, back to the
campaign. '

Q: A three-step program?

A: Yes. The first step concerns
public involvement. I want to see every
God-fearing American carrying bags of
oranges, from Florida of course. I want
them armed and ready when they come’
upon some known or suspected
homosexual, or “human garbage,” as I
like to call them. Anyway, l suggest that
when these citizens come upon
homosexuals, they pelt them with the

oranges. ‘Isn’t that a nifty idea? We
even have a slogan for our cam-
paign—“Fight Fruits With Fruit!”

Q: What is the second step?

A: Oh, that's even better. lthought it
would be so much fun it we could tie up
homosexuals with lots of pink ropes,
and put them in special homes. Sort of
like "little summer camps, except with
barbed wire and electric fences. Then
we force them back on the road to nor-
mality by showering them with Christian
love, affection and posters of Farrah
Fawcett for the boys, and John Travolta
for the girls.

Q: And if that doesn't help?

A: Why, we shoot them, of course‘.

Q: Wouldn’t that make you feel

1 guilty?

A: Of course not. I have God's per-
mission, you know. He spoke to me. I
heard his voice. He appeared in the
form of a bird to me.

Q: Was ita dove?

A: No. The Orange Bird.

Q: Well, what would you do if I told
you I was gay?

A: Pelt you with oranges, give you a
Christian hug, then shoot you. Why
such silly questions?

Q: Well, Miss Bryant, this may be a

wﬁr shock to you, but I'm. ..

We are sorry this interview could not
be continued due to unforseen circum-
stances. Services for the 5th A ve repor-
ter will be held today at Heinz Chapel.

 

While reading back issues of Life
magazine on the fourth floor of Hillman
Library, a 5 th Ave reporter was ac-
costed by a person in an ankle-length
raincoat. Sensing that this person could
be the Hillman Flasher, the fourth-ﬂoor
flake, the academic aberration, the

, literary lecher, our reporter asked for,

and received, an exclusive intimate look
(and we mean intimate!) at the man
behind the raincoat. Some excerpts:

Q: First, what kind of raincoat is
that? Harbor Master?

A: .No way. I buy only the best. This
is a London Fog. Besides, Harbor
Master irritates my skin. You.know, I
once traced the history of flashing and
discovered that some of the original

 

flashers didn’t wear raincoats at all.
Rumor has it that the first flasher just.lift-
ed up_ his fig leaf in the Garden of Eden.

Q: You mean Adam was a flasher?

' A: Well, you know, we all have our
quirks. Who amlto judge?

Q: How did you get into flashing?

A: I started young and worked my
way through the ranks. When I came
out of college, I started at a municipal
library, then moved to a branch of the

‘Free Library in Philadelphia. About four
Years 890, a position opened up here at
Pitt. I’m hoping to get tenure in a year or
two.

Q: What do you do when you’re not
flashing?

A: I’m an obscure, high-ranking of-
ficial here at Pitt.

Q: Hmmm, I thought you. looked
familiar. But anyway, what is the
strangest thing that ever happened to
you while you were flashing?

A: Well, this one time I crept up
behind this girl and opened my raincoat.
She turned around, screamed, then
slammed her book shut before I could
close my raincoat. It was just my luck
that the book was “Webster's
Unabridged Dictionary.” l was sidelined
for a month.

Q: If you don't mind my asking, what
are those scars on your body?

A; we||_ | use-d.to work in a strip-
tease joint. But I needed some better
way to get an education, so here I am.
This is a good library. You can get a

good education while also doing the
things you enjoy. There is one problem,
though. The library closes early
especially during mid-terms. That is my
busiest time. My business fell off nearly
35 percent. _

Q: Did the coal strike affect you?

A: It sure did. Customers stayed
away from up here because it was so
dark, and I need light to work. And it
was really cold, too. l could have gotten
frostbite. Business was down 57 per-
cent from a year ago. Hey, sorry to cut
you short, but I see some prospective
customers, and one of them looks like
she's been here before.

Q: Oh, right. Thank you for your
time.

A: Tell your friends to come up and
see me sometime. -It's the best
education they'll get at Pitt.

Campus police are known to be some
of the least-appreciated of our friends in
Oakland. Although they. perform many
services for us, they are gnerally ignored
except when they ticket our cars or ask
us to stop loitering in front of local fast-
food restaurants.

Our 5 th A ve reporters decided to give
the campus police some well deserved
coverage. To find a police officer it was
necessary to go to the main Oakland
police station—The White Tower.

Q: Isn’t a fast-food restaurant an
unusual place for a police station?

A. Where else can you find so many
violations of the law? (He choked on a
french fry.) Even the menu is a crime.

 

 

Q: Do you make arrests here?

A: Just yesterday we had a spray-
can raid.

Q. Isn’t this an out-of-the-way
location for a police station?
No. The White Tower gives me a

 

perfect view of Oakland. (He winked
suggestively at a waitress.) And when
they clean the windows, I can even see
what's going on outside.

Q. What are the main hazards of
yourjob?

Policeman's eylid and policeman’s
knee.

Q: Could you explain that?

A. Policeman's eyelid is caused by
terminal boredom, and policeman’s
knee by remaining stationary fr’ en en-
tire shift.

Q: Is there any cure for these
problems?

A: Policeman's eyelid can be
relieved by the surgical implantation of
toothpicks. The only cure for
policeman’s knee is to get another job.

Q: Don't you have any problems with
criminals? _

A: No. We just feed suspects White
Tower hamburgers until they crack.

Q: l have a feeling here's another‘
reason for making your headquarters
here that you're not telling me. What is
it?

A: Well, I'll tell you if you promise not
to tell the A.S.P.C.A. (He pulled fur-
tively on a heavy leash.) It's because
they let Maimer eat here, too.

So readers, we hope you ’ve enjoyed
the preceding look at Oakland life. This
story took its toll on the staff of 5th
Ave. One of our reporters is in the
hospital, where doctors are testing for
rabies. Another has been plunged into

an incurable depression because of a
close encounter. A third 5 th A ve repor-
ter was arrested as an accessory to in-

decent exposure in Hillman Library and

the fourth reporter—— well, may he rest in
peace.

Have We Got ci Disease for You

Editor’s note: Pitt health officials
have been astonished this year by the
number of virtually untreatable
psychological abnormalities detected in
members of the Pitt community. The Pitt
Health Service has released the
following study, which will be sent to the
National Center for Disease Control’s
department of existential psychoses.

FORBES COMPLEX

This neuroses, new to Pitt
psychologists, currently is running ram-
pant throughout the university. It is
known to strike people about to be

faced with major relocation. Its sym-j

ptoms are frustration, anger and con-
fusion. Its long-term symptoms (which
may take up to four years to cure) are
frustration, anger and utter chaos.

Doctors have spotted the disease in
people working in major departments
like political science, sociology and
other Mervis Hall occupants, as well as
the occupants of Bruce Hall.

Strange hysterical fits accompany
this. neurosis, and generally are caused
by mismanagement and delays. There
have been several documented cases,
followed by one or more of the following
circumstances:

—-Being forced to move out of one
location on Friday, and not being
allowed into the new location until Wed-
nesday.

—Being informed keys for new of-
fices have to be ordered two weeks
before they are needed, and finding out
the department only gets one week's
notice of the move. ‘

The disease also is known to strike
students. It is latent in all members of
the Pitt community, but seems to be
precipitated by going into a new building
and finding two different room numbers

(in code, of course) on each door.

It can also manifest itself in a fear of
walking under wide open spaces hung
with enormous Cantini sculptures.

Administrators also are likely to be hit
by the disease sooner or later. its

results are catatonia about energy bills,
alternating with delirous ravings about
cascading escalators.

IDENTITY CRISIS

A very serious, near psychopathic
disease, which strikes down those in-
volved with the university in almost any
way. It manifests itself in many forms:

Faculty members are known to drink
15 to 20 cups of Burger Chef coffee a
day in trying -to resolve this conflict. It
occurs when they think about the impor-
tance of research versus the mission of
the university, which they are told is
teaching. V ‘

It is known to create insomnia and
gastrointestinal discomfort in faculty
members—especially those who would
stay up thinking about it anyway, like
chemistry, biology and mathematics

faculty.
Students are hit by this disease of
the 1970’s at seasonal times:

registration, graduation and job hunting.
In trying to decide whether to take
engineering, chemistry and computer

  
  
  
   
  
 
  

science or fine arts, English literature
and history, students resort to tossing
coins, playing tic tac toe, and betting on
the Pittsburgh Penguins.

Sometimes they can be seen at the
door of the placement center, scratch-
ing at the door, and mumbling
something incomprehensible about the
nature of a liberal arts education.

To the administration, it is the cause
of many sleepless nights because of the

choices that must be made about the

university’s official stand on the impor-
tance of football versus the importance
of academics.

PLACE US ENVY

This is a disease generally restricted
to residence hall students who failed to
get their money in on time, and can’t live
in the dorms next year. It is also known
to strike graduating seniors looking for
jobs and applicants to medical, dental
and law schools.

DELUSIONS OF GRANDEUR

Not everyone at the university will be -

hit by this disease, which knows no
seasonal bounds. But some people con-
tract worse cases than others.

Faculty members and administrators
occasionally exhibit some forms of the
disease. One manifestation of the
disease this year is the creation of the
University Honors Program.

The university planners (five-, 10-
and 20-year), it results in an ideology
called “manifest destiny.”

Secreted in the depths of the
Cathedral are documents which tell of
the University's plans to take over all of
South Oakland and North Oakland, too.
Of course, there has been some talk of
a “merger” with Carnegie-Mellon
University—something like the Louisiana
Purchase.

Students are not exempt from this
disease. It is particularly virulent on the
governing boards of various student
groups—undergraduate Student Gover-
nment Board, the School of General
Studies Student Cabinet, Black Action
Society, IFC-Panhellinic Council.

Graduate students are particularly
susceptible—after all, they're serious
about school now. It also is known to
plague law students, medical students
and philosophy grad students.

PARANOIA

This is a disease often contracted by
the Chancellor and other high-level ad-
ministrators. They often think someone
is trying to get them——students, faculty
and of course, the State Legislature.

It is difficult to diagnose because
they sometimes are correct. Some of.
the pressure can be alleviated by firing
noisy professors like former Pitt
sociology professor Paul Nyden and
former Pitt biochemist Dr. Sharon John-
son. according _to a certain high-level
Pitt dean.

This neurosis is known to plague
professors, especially those who teach
classes of more than 300 students. It is
also a seasonal disease, striking during
the tenure season, when professors are
afraid other people in their department

will hold a grudge over messy desks,
lack of money in the coffee pool and
disinterest in scholarly criticism about
manners, clothes and hairstyle.

These professors (particulary junior
faculty) who are afraid of being fired
because they haven't published

 enough, resort to writing nasty letters to
 newspapers so they can see their

names in print.
ELECTRIC COMPLEX  

Formerly known to strike only
women, this Pitt neurosis has taken its
toll on members of both sexes. It can
strike Pitt administrators, staff and
students at any time of the day or night.

Symptoms of its presence include
sudden cold flashes when sitting in
classes in the Cathedral or David

Lawrence or in offices on campus.

Campus and area residents discover
that their clocks run slowly, their electric
curlers lose their curl and their hot pots
heat slowly.

In classes and office buildings on
campus, people have reported eye
strain from taking notes in dark
classrooms. Secretaries report Amal-
functions in their typewriters and adding
machines. -

The disease is often known to cause

hallucinations, including visions of
escalators going nowhere and
stationary elevators.
- T It is not known how long the chills
and hallucinations last. Officials expect
the illness to run its course by the time
spring occurs, however.

FRANTIC-IMPRESSWE

Pitt professors with this neurosis of-
ten talk about how much their students
love them, how much the local literary
society liked their new play, or how
much their colleagues at other schools
respect their work. During their classes,
they are known to talk about their
previous activities, including antiwar ac-
tivities during the 1960's, “when
students were activist.”

This symptom is regarded as the
need to “relate” to students, and helps
professors when they seek laudatory
letters regarding teaching when tenure
season rolls around. These professors
alsq. are willing to “give students a
break” when they have a severe
problem like Place Us Envy.

Students who manifest this neurosis

are known to run frantically from onegglv»
organization to another, so they will ‘

have a long list of activities to put on
their applications to graduate schools.
Many frantic-impressives can be
found at gatherings of organizations
such as Omicron Delta Kappa, Druids
and the Student Government Board.
The frantic-impressives have an annual
‘gathering where they can frantically-
impress each other, known as the
Honors Convocation. The most frantic
gets to carve his name in the walk out-
side of the Cathedral. They also are ob-

.9.-J

sessed with seeing their names in print.

These students also hover around
professors after classes, asking to

(Continued on Page 7)

A Disease for You

A April Fool's Day 1978—5TH AVENUE—Page 7

( Continued from Page 6)

borrow things like the prof’s graduate
dissertation.

ln administrators, the disease elicits
some Of the same. reactions as in
professors notably the desire to “be in
touch with students." Chancellor
Posvar is known to be very concerned
Over this matter—he once was
discovered walking around the
Cathedral on a Sunday afternoon,
looking for students to “relate tO."

There also is an element of the
disease peculiar to administrators. They
frantically need to impress the presi-
dents and chancellors of other univer-
sities, not to mention Pitt's Own alumni.
This is especially apparent when one
university has a winning football team.

REPRESSION

Repression is the most commonly
found Pitt neurosis.

Pitt administrators constantly repress
the desire to blow up the State Capitol,
not to mention getting rid of students
who impede the business Of running a
university.

Faculty members also suppress the
desires to eliminate students who get in
the way of publishing and research.

Students constantly repress the
desire to eliminate the State Legislature,
the administration, and the faculty, all of
whom get in the way of learning.

For students, the frustration of sup-
pressing these desires erupts yearly in-

to what has been termed as “Spring
Fever” by the Chancellor. At this time,
students spontaneously gather in the
Quad to drink beer, chant slogans and
sing Pitt’s alma mater.

The previous list of neuroses is far from
complete, according to Pitt officials.
Students are warned that with the onset
of final exams and long summers at
home, new neuroses and psychoses
will attack the most unsuspecting vic-
tims.

Officials warn there are no cures;
however, some measures can be taken
to reduce the chances of contracting
one of the above psychological abnor-
malities.

University officials recommend large
doses of college classes for their
tranquilizing effect On the nerves and
their dulling effect on the brain.

The Student Government Medical
Action committee recommends sex,
alcohol or drugs to reduce the intensity
of reality at Pitt (the cause of many
neuroses and psychoses).

There is also a rumor that a new joint
student-faculty self-help center is of-
fering classes in how to make it through
the psychoses season with little more
than shaking hands and muscle twit-
ches. Two classes now reported to be
open for enrollment are a self-analysis
class in keeping a sense of perspective
and a class in how to take s--t with a
sense of humor.
