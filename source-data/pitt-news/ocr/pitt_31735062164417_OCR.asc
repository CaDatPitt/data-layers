Applications
Increase

For 1965

By JACKI KATZ
The University has received
approxicately 50 per cent more
applications for admission to

' next year’s freshman class than

last year at this time, according
to Jack B. Critchﬁeld, director
of admissions. '

As of last Thursday, the Uni-
versity had received 3,250 appli-
cations as compared with 2,384
last year- The number of stu-
dents already accepted by the
University and those who have
already paid their matriculation
fee has risen by a proportionate
percentage.

Eighty-six students have al-
ready paid their matriculation fee

' as compared with 42 last year

and the University has already
accepted 1,195 this year as com-
pared with 604 last year.
Critchﬁeld attributed the in-
crease in applications to a com-
bination of three items: 1) in-
crease in the number of students
eligible” to enter college; 2) an
increase in the number of stu-
dents making multiple applica-
tions to colleges, and 3) the Uni-
versity was able to provide pros-
pective students with informa-
tion and applications about two

__ months earlier than usual. ,
Even though there is an in-

crease in applications now, Critch-
ﬁeld explained that it is “unlike-
ly for this University to ever
experience a great return of de-
posits this early since most stu-
dents apply to colleges with a
common reply date.”

Cheating Reported by Student
Following Psychology 80 Exam

By LINDA GOLDSTEIN

The Air Force Academy of Colorado Springs has trans-
ferred its problem to the Oakland area of Pittsburgh. An
answer sheet for the Psychology 80 examination given Jan.
29 was discovered to have circulated among certain students
in the two sections of the course.

The same afternoon that the test was given a girl went ‘to Dr.
Arthur R. Orgel, assistant professor of psychology and teacher of
one section of Psychology 80, with a carbon copy of the 50 answers
of the examination. ~

She had found it on the desk of another girl in the dormitory,
and in her bitterness she took the copy to the psychology teachers.
She refused to identify the guilty student.

The following Monday, Dr. Orgel and Dr. Merle Moskowitz, asso-
ciate professor of Psychology and the other teacher of Psychology
so. decided that the fairest thing to _do would be to discount the
grades.of the exam.

Dr. Orgel expressed his regret “for the majority who took the
test honestly. On the other hand, with the grades scaled, the honest
students would be penalized by being compared with the cheaters.”

After announcing this decision in class last Monday, Dr. Mosko-
witz received a visit from the girl from whom the answers had
been taken. She told him that the information had been given to
her as a “study guide” and that she had been unaware that she had
had the test answers in her position.

Dr. Orgel commented that the girl may have been telling the
truth, since she had only received a “C” on the examination. Dr.
Moskowitz "expressed his belief in the validity of her account.

Dr. Moskowitz and Dr. Orgel turned the situation over to Helen
P. Rush, dean of students, in their belief that the administration
should conduct the investigation.

The irony of the present episode is that last year the depart-
ment__suspe_cted ‘sucha leak’, and took elaborate precautions to insure
that it would not happen again. "There hadibeen unconﬁrmed state-
ments from undergraduates to the effect that certain groups on cam-
pus had obtained copies of the test.

A deﬁnite discrepancy in the way people associated with these
groups performed in the psychology course and their other grades
provoked the department to construct «a new ﬁnal exam with security
measures taken.

The people who had been suspected failed the ﬁnal after having
obtained straight “A’s” in the previous exams. The teachers could

not prove that cheating had occurred on the basis of circumstantial
evidence alone, however.

On the basis of last year.’s events, the department tightened their
security precautions. The 500 mimeographed copies of the test were
numbered, each student wrote down the number of his respective
test booklet, and each booklet was collected before any student was
permitted to leave the room. Afterwards, the graduate assistants
checked every page of every test copy, accounting for all the booklets-

The copies of the examination -and the answers were looked in
a cabinet in Dr. Moskowitz’s office, while the only two keys to the
cabinet were in his graduate assistant’s and his own possession.

Towers Residents

Present Complaints

Auxiliary Enterprises, coodinators of the. University's
Book Center, residence halls, and food services, has prom-

men living in the three tow-
ers.

The grievances included an
all-purpose liquid vending ma-
chine which would be available
24 hours a day and would be lo-
cated outside the snack bar. The
machine requested will dispense
soup, coffee, and hot chocolate.
They also asked for a soap pack-
et and bleach machine in the
laundry and .a change machine
in the lobby and the laundry.

Altholtz also asked that the
mats in the exercise room in
Tower B be cleaned regularly;
that a bench be put in the exer-
cise room for bench presses; that
an inclined sit-up boards and a
ﬁx machine be installed, and
that there be more lockers, es-
pecially ones big enough to hold
weights and bars.

He also urged that University

extension phones be placed on
house ﬂoors; that a constant
check be kept on elevator but-
tons, both in the elevators and
on the ﬂoors, and that bulbs be
replaced as necessary.

Altholtz also asked for bulletin
boards above the elevator but-
tons, complained of a lack of
televisions available in the Tow-
ers, noted that wooden sections
missing -from under the desks in
some of the rooms produce a cold
draft, and suggested that stair-
ways should be cleaned more

Hughes said that all grievances
would be rectiﬁed except for two.

Says Half of Students Cheat

In the Feb. 5, 1965 issue of Life maga-
zine, a review was presented of one of the
most extensive studies ever done on cheat-
ing on the American college campus, It
was published last month by the Bureau of Ap-
plied Research at,Columbia University.

Here are the major ﬁndings 85 Summarized
by Life: ' ‘

D Close to half of the 5,000 students inter-
‘viewed anonymously at 99 colleges and univer-
sities admitted they had cheated in some way
since they had been in college.

D Over half of those interviewed said they
had seen other students cheating. It was esti-
mated that cheating occurs on about eight per
cent of all ﬁnal exams and about 13 per cent of
out-of-class assignments.

D The highest percentage of cheaters (68
per cent of them) are average students who said
they cared little about their grades, but said
they had pressures from home to get good grades.

DPoor students tend to cheat oftener than
other students. Fifty-seven per cent of the ad-
mitted cheaters had average of “C—” or below.

D However, good students also cheat, accord-

A ing to the report. It was estimated that 37 per

cent of all “A” students interviewed had cheated
at some time since they entered college.

D The report said that classrooms with tough
regulations (constant proctoring, separating stu-
dents, giving different tests, refusing students

; permission to leave the room) are the class-
'_ rooms where cheating is most likely to occur.

D Multiple choice and true and false tests

are most frequently cheated on. There is more
cheating in a course where there are frequent
tests and where the same standarized tests are
given every year.

D More cheating occurs in large lecture.

D There is a correlation between number of
study hours and amount of cheating. Of students
who study for 30 hours ‘or more per week, only
42 per cent cheat. But 57 _per cent of those
interviwed who studied for fewer than 19 hours
a week admitted to cheating-

D If a student comes to college solely to learn,
his chances of cheating are lessened. Of students
who come to college “to provide a basic educa-
tion and appreciation of ideas,” only 45 per cent
cheat.

Fifty-four per cent of the students who came
to college for social reasons cheat and those who
came for vocational training, 52 per cent admit-
ted to cheating.

D Ninety per cent of those interviewed (in-
cluding many admitted cheaters) said they were
morally opposed to cheating. It’s much worse
to cheat than to turn in another student for
cheating, according to over half of those inter-
viewed. Of this group, 16 per cent said they
would report even a close friend and 51 per
cent said they would ignore a friend who asked
for help during an exam.

D Cheating occurs far less at schools which
have an honor system designed and enforced
by students. Cheating is most prevalent where
there is .an attempt at joint control by a com-
bined student-faculty monitoring system.

American Legionnadc Asks’

Ban on Communist Speakers

(Collegiate Press Service)

The national commander
of the American Legion has
said that the recent student

demonstrations on the Uni-
Versity of California's Berk-
ley campus indicates a need
for a ban on communists
speaking at educational institu-
tions.

The commander, Donald John-
son, told 250 Legionnaires in
Lodi, California, that the Berk-
eley demonstrations were “an ex-
ample of deﬁiance of ours laws

‘and abusive actions against our

peace officers,

Police arrested 801 demonstra-
tors Dec. 2, following a sit-in in
the university’s administration
building as a climax to months
of student protests against the
school’s regulations governing po-
litical activity on campus.

“I think the recent events at
the University of California are
new evidence of the need for the
(communist speaker) ban,” John-
son said.

“Who is to deny that young
minds are impressionable, and
who would knowingly submit his
own children to the teachings of
a known communist or one who
is thoroughly indoctrinated in
communist ideology?”

The student demonstrations are
closely tied to a drive by the
American Communist P.arty to
speak before high school, college,
and university groups, he said.

The communists consider their
effort worthwhile if they convert
but a single student to their
cause,” he said- “It was Gus Hall
himself, the general secretary of
the American Communist Party,
who said the youth program of
the party is so important that
he would go anywhere to meet
with young students even it but-
one student were met.”

Johnson said he was conﬁdent
that the vast majority of Ameri-
can youth was not gullible
enough to swallow communist
ideology. “Yet,” he said, “we
know there are some who are
susceptible, and this was proved
at Berkeley.

“Some 800 out of a total of
27,000 students doesn’t seem like
much, but it is too many.”

The American Legion opposes
the appearance of “spokesmen
for the communist conspiracy on
tax-suported properties,” John-
son said, “thus using these facil-
ities for sounding board for com-
munist propaganda.”

Johnson said the American tax-
payer has no legal or moral
obligation to V aid and abet a
cause which, “is dedicated to the
overthrow of our system of gov-
ernment and the destruction of
the American way of life.

“There are all too many other
forums and facilities available to
Red-oriented speakers,” he said.

The Berkeley- demonstrations
are another example of the in-
creased civil disobedience and
disregard for law and order, ac-
cording to Johnson.

“The American Legion deplores
and opposes the action of any
groups or individuals who would
try to dictate our way of life by
taking the law into their own
hands or by acting lawlessly,”
he said.

“Recent stories about police
brutality on the Berkeley campus
have been used as a rallying
point by people who advocate
civil disobedience,” Johnson con-
tinued. “Those involved in the
demonstrations showed absolute-
ly no respect for the law, but at
the same time demanded full
sanction of their actions.”

Johnson said that although he
did not visit the Berkely cam-
pus, he had talked ‘vith many
.of the university's faculty mem-
bers, students, and administra-
tors.

“The students I talked to had
very little reaction of any sort to
the demonstrations,” Johnson
said. “They seemed for more con-
cerned about their studies, but
they were very disturbed by the

fact that many of their classes

had been cancelled during the
demonstrations.”

Many classes were cancelled
when the university faculty held
an “emergency” meeting to de-
cide what its stand would be to-
ward the Free Speech Movement.

“I found that the recent grad-
uates of the university were the
ones who were most disturbed
by the events on the Berkely

campus,” Johnson said. “These
young people are just entering
the professional world, where
good images are so important,
and they are realizing it for the
ﬁrst time in their lives-”

The students who participated
in the demonstrations “will live
to regret it,” he said.

“The students now realize that
their arrest will be on their rec-
ords for life. It will be particular-
ly harmful to them when they
apply for jobs—especially civil
service.”

g  f It ‘Offers

  he Conscience of a Conservative

 By Sandy Fox '

The faith in Barry Goldwater of those
Americans who supported him during the
past campaign was often termed “a reli-
gion.”- Conservatism, itself, has likewise

~ been referred to as almost a religion. The

natural question to follow is that of, Why ?

I Why is such a philosophy a religion to

those who adhere to it?

Perhaps the answer can be found in
what may be termed the “magic of Con-

servatism.” College students, especially,"

have fallen under the spell of this particu-
lar philosophy. Conservatism is magic be-
cause, simply, it inspires, It inspires uni-_
versity students because, too often, too

.' many college professors fail to do so.

Thus the intellectual student must turn
elsewhere for stimulation-—to Conserva-
tism, for instance.

, THE STUDENT needs inspiration be-
cause, at bottom, he is in search of truth

—without, perhaps, even recognizing this-

fact himself. The professors, unfortunate-
ly, are not gearing themselves or their
lectures to this pursuit of truth.

Conservatism serves as a stimulus be-
cause it offers to the student eternal
truths. The truth, for instance, that we

 live under a republican, not a democratic,

form of federal government. Conserva-
tism offers facts to this an-d proves this to
be a truth. It also attempts to prove t-he
truth that a Republic is the best form of
government.

- Conservatism deﬁnes words such as
“liberty” and thus gives this reverred

 word a meaning for the student who cares

  

about his country and its traditions. Pro-
fessors fail here. They do not press the
student for these truths nor do they offer

them themselves. Just what, for example,

is “biology?” Orfmore to the point, what
is “life?” Professors ask students to ques-
tion without really questioning themselves.
Conservatism questions and gives answers
or instills in the student the necessary
thirst to ﬁnd the answer for himself.

STUDENTS HAVE the desire‘ to know,

‘but sometimes this desire lies dormant

within them and ﬂourishes only under
stimulation. ‘Conservatism offers this stim-
ulation, and thus, once intrigued, the stu-
dent further pursues Conservatism, and,
in so doing, pursues knowledge and, even-
tually, truth.

Perhaps, in pursuing this magic of
Conservatism, the magic which any philos-
ophy tumed religion has for a person,
especially for an intellectual, has been dis-
covered, The intellectual que:tion, and
the philosophy gives facts which turn into
proofs.

‘ AS LONG AS this philosophy gives
answers to truths which are good and does
not question the goodness of these truths
(such as, perhaps, Nazism did), the philos-

ophy remains true to itself and to those

who follow it. ' ‘
Students have a duty to recognize a

“good” philosophy—i.e., one which mis-

construes the criteria. Professors have a
duty to present the good and the bad and
to guide the student towards the better
choice by “inspiring” him.

  

 

Society Blamed
For Cheating

Editor, The Pitt News:
All the articles that have ap-
peared in The Pitt News and

. other publications cover the topic

of cheating very well. However,
all of these articles miss the most
important thing. I refer to the

' ‘general deterioration of the
_ American society.

I imagine that most students
feel the same way about cheat-

 ing as businessmen feel when

they falsify income tax returns.
That is, it’s not bad as long as
you are not caught. In a_ society
that allows the “anything for a
quick buck” philosophy to exist,

-how can we be so surprised when
' students are found cheating.

-We .are brought up in a society
that allows, or even condones,

 cheating. The businessman who

allows his product to be pack-

Editor, The Pitt News:

On Jan. 29, Dr. Orgel’s 1 p.m.
class took its ﬁrst examination
of the trimester. Ebzpecting to
ﬁnd our grades on the test the
following Monday, we were in-
stead informed that due to an
organized cheating ring being
cracked the grades made on the
test would not count.

Instead, a section of the ﬁnal
exam will cover the same ma-
terial with two grades being giv-
en, one for the ﬁrst test which
was junked and one for the ﬁnal.

Due to an organized cheating
ring being cracked, I and many
other students are being deprived
of a grade which I worked to
achieve, which I studied for sev-
eral hours, I, in other words,
was cheated by group of cheat-
ers, as were many others.

There's a Pitt cheer that goes,
“Let’s go Pitt!” Okay, “Let’s go
Pitt!” Let’s get rid of these .peo-
ple. Let’s get out and do some-
thing; organize a system in which
cheating has no place. “Let’s go
Pitt!” Let’s let the" cheaters be
judged by their equals, by other

» students such as you and I.

Are we supposed to sit back
and let this go on without pro-
testing? I, for one, would like to
know what cheaters are doing at
Pitt? I would like to know what
is going to be done?

Is this a University, a Cathe-
dral of Learning, or a Cathedr.a1
of Hypocrisy?

Senior Assts.

Called Task I

-Editor,'1‘he Pitt News:

The privileges and authorities
granted to senior assistants are
to a certain degree being abused.
Several of the senior assistants
seem to regard their duties as ful-
ﬁlled when they merely issue in-
discriminate campuses.

The purpose of this duty, as
the name implies, is to assist
rather than to govern. However.
the only people assisted are, in
fact, the senior assistants them-
selves.

Disturb whoever you Wish, but
do not disturb the upperclass
women in charge of you. If you
do this last, you will be prop-
erly (the term is used for want
of a better one) punished.

As long as the situation is con-
tinued, it is obvious that the
campuses will be meted out to
those whose rooms .are located
closest to their senior assistants.
Support is given to this by the
fact that at the time of this writ-
ing, a signiﬁcant number of cam-
puses are pending to girls whose
rooms are most nearly opposite
their senior assistants regardless
of the ﬂoors who won which they
reside. Adding to the intolerable
situation, general campuses are
issued to everyone in sight with-
out inquiry into circumstances.

Truly those of us who live un-
der constant threat of abused au-
thority are tired of this tyrarmy
and, in fact, refuse to accept it
any longer. We protest! I

InSPW€ltl0n Needed 

The Highest Honor

 By Joel Beeler

First of a three-part serz'e.s' on the Liberal Arts curriculum.

The distribution of studies program was designed to
serve a speciﬁc purpose—-to broaden the individual, i.e. to
attempt to despecialize within the age of specialization. It
1§ the aD0the_osis of the Whole man concept of the true
liberal education. '

The _principle is worthwhile. But, on the practical level

the distribution of studies program has become self-defeat-
. ing, in many ways. Instead of broad-

ening the individual, it lessens the

him with inflexible rules, inadequate
programs, and inadequate courses.

IN EVERY University depart-
ment the distribution program has
become something different. In some
departments it is very good, in oth-
ers miserably bad. Some offer 80
courses only; some 80 and 180 cours-
es; and others series of 80 level cours-
es to offerthe student a wide choice and the chance to co-
ordinate his education within the distribution program.
Among these courses, some are a real learning experience,
others a miserable bore. Why? The largest single answer
is the faculty member teaching the course.

 

BEELER.

The faculty member is especially crucial to the inter-
disciplinary course. The nature of the course demand a
faculty member who is: well educated in the whole field,
not just his particular discipline; and a faculty member who
is capable of exciting and stimulating teaching_ These
courses are not designed for the student to gain any real
knowledge in depth, rather they are designed to stimulate
the student and interest him in further study.

THE INSTRUCTOR must do this, if he cannot the
course is wasted. An interdis course can be an integral part
of the liberal education, or it can be a waste. It all depends
on the faculty member. .

The quality of instruction is also crucial for other 80
level courses. It is not necessary for the teacher to be the
worlds greatest expert on anything, it is necessary that he
be dedicated to teaching—to stimulating the student toward
further study—the true goal of a liberal education. This
is the true measure of a successful teacher. The mark he
can make on a new mind. This is a sacred trust. Teaching
the eighty level course should be the highest honor the uni-
versity could give a teacher. It is now in many cases the

\Freedom of Federalism

By SANDY FOX

Whenever you speak of
the American form of gov-
ernment—call it a “federal
republic’ and not a “democ-
racy.” In Freedom and Fed-
eralism (Henry Regnery
Company (298 pgs., $1.45).

Felix Morley defends the re-
publican form of our federal
government. In so doing, Morley
points out the fallacies of refer-
ring to the ,American form of
government as a “political de-
mocracy.”

Morely shows what he feels is
a degenlertaion of our federal re-
public into a political democracy.
The federal republic had powers
separated among the legislative,
judicial, and .executive branches
of the various local, state, and
the national governments. The"
political democracy on the other
hand relies on the powers of a
strong, national executive with
its powers derived from the ma-
jority will, thus negating the
power of minorities.

In line with the title of his
book, Morley points out the dif-
ferent meanings of the words
“freedom” and “liberty.” “Free-
dom,” Morley asserts, “has come

to be used where security is
meant.” This is freedom in the
positive sense meaning freedom

* from something, e.g. hunger or

poverty.

“Liberty,” however, is “a con-
dition of the mind rather than
the body.” Under this deﬁnition
liberty is negative in the sense
that it is the right to do as one
desires without governmental in-
terference. Therfore, to Morley,
liberty is the more desired of the
two because it allows the individ-
ual judgment in determining his
actions.

As federalism has declined, so
has freedom degenerated into se-
curity as is evidenced in Frank-
lin 'Rooseve1t’s “freedom from
want.”

In order to preserve liberty (in
Mor1ey’s deﬁnition) and Ameri-
can federalism, faith "in the Con-
stitution. and in the liberties it
guarantees is necessary, Morley
maintains-

Morley makes active use of the
Constitution and The Federalist
papers in arguing his case. He

quotes‘ Supreme Court decisions
and the justices who made the
decisions.

Rousseau’s concept of the “gen-
eral will” also enters into Mor-
ley’s case. The “general will” al-
lows the majority supreme power
with little regard for minority
rights. This concept, Morley
argues, had much to do with the
decline of the separate divisions
of power in the American federal
republic into the political demo-
cracy of the mass will.

Morley, one time editor of the
Washington Post, presents his
case well. Unfortunately, though,
his book is written more for the
learned man than for the aver-
age American. His book is too
much of a scholarly essay.

But for the person who can
understand the impact of Rous-
seau’s concept of the “general

_will” on the thinking of Marx

and on American thinking, and
for the person who can become
concerned over the still current
issue of whether the United
States is a republic or a demo-
cracy.

Panthers’

DARYLE RUBY scores on a hook shot in Saturday's basketball game
against Fordham. The Panthers lost, 66-53. ’

Shooting

 Inaccurate in Loss

Contributions to the Panther scoring fund on Saturday
night were sparse. Points were as hard to get as a refund
, from the cashier in Student Records. Fordham however,
didn’t have too much trouble scoring as they downed the
Panthers, 66-53, at the Fiftzgerald Field House with 976

fans Watching.

No one wanted to get into the
scoring column for the Panthers
in the ﬁrst half as the team only
shot 22 per cent. No Panther had
a ﬁeld goal until ﬁve minutes
were gone in the game and Bob
Lovett connected. The ﬁrst seven
points the home team had were
on foul shots.

Both teams were having trou-
ble with the zone defenses and
Fordham went into the dressing

. room at half time with only a

29-22 lead. “We knew they were
going to have a zone defense and
and zone press, but we couldn't
shoot well enough to counteract
it,” said Panther Coach Bob Tim-
mons.

' Fordham Coach John Bach was
elated since his squad won their
ﬁrst game from the Panthers at
the Field House. “We didn’t play
a zone especially for Pitt,” he
said. “We played well the begin-
ning of the season using a man-
to-man but were losing the close
games so we switched to a zone
and have been much more suc-
cessful.

“Actually we feared the shoot-
ing of the Panthers a little. Es-
pecially Dave _Blyshak, Larry
Szykowny, Bob Lovett and Daryle
Ruby on the short jumbs,” said
Bach. “We were lucky however,
and didn’t get hurt.”

The turning point of the game
came when John Stevens, Ford-
ham candidate for All-East, scored
11 points in a row midway
through the second half with the
Panthers only trailing 43-38. “We
held him in the ﬁrst half to only

one ﬁeld goal,” said Timmons,
“but he was getting inside our
defense in the second half .and
we couldn’t stop him.”

Bach who is also Athletic Di-
rector at Fordham said that he
will deﬁnitely continue the series
between the two clubs. “We en-
joy playing here and Bob (Tim-
mons) is a wonderful guy. ‘we
will continue playing Pitt as long
as they want to schedule us al-
though we'll have to play here
because of a committment to play
a certain number of games in
the Metropolitan area.”

Dukes Defeat
Cubs, 56 - 50

It takes just one day, one game
to snap a losing streak. The
freshman basketball team wishes
that day‘ to _come soon, very soon.

Duquesne outscored the Cubs,
57-50, Saturday night to stretch
the frosh winless skein to eight
straight games.

The Cubs held a 23-21 halftime
edge, thanks to many steals by
guard Frank Famularo. But with
the score 38-38 and eight minutes
to -go in the game, Cub turn-

overs enabled the Dukes to reel‘

of! 14 straight points and lock
away the contest.

Ken Bollens led the Cubs with
19 points but he missed several
key layups. Bill Reilly sparked
Duquesne with 17 points. Rich
Carlberg, who scored 33 points
against the fresh in the game at
the Civic Arena, was held to six
points by Tom Beckett.

Injured Wrist No Problem

BYBILLCABIN

Columbus—Frank O’Korn, Mike John-
son, Dino Boni, Tom Baily, and Lee Hall
each won three matches ‘Saturday, lead-

ing the wrestling team to wins against
Ohio State, Purdue, and Virginia Tech in

a tri-dual meet here.

O’Korn dominated his three opponents, out-
pointing Purdue’s Rich Black 10-2, Ohio State's
Art Rosenblum 5-0, and pinning Mike Steel of

Virginia Tech at 2:59.

Johnson gave his best performances of the
year, winning all three matches with ease. “John-
son wrestled three good matches,” said Peery.
“His weight was good, .and he appears to be
coming back well from his injury.” The matches
were the ﬁrst 130-pound division contests John-

son had this year.

Boni ran his record to 5-0-1, outclassing each
opponent in the 137-pound matches. He led Pur-
due’s Don Dooley, 6-2, going into the third per-
iod, pinning him with ﬁve seconds remaining.
Boni’s other victims were the Buckeye’s Bill

Founds and Tech’s Ken Cole.

Baily broke a four meet losing streak, beat-
ing the Boilermaker’s Dale Smith, 4-0. Despite
a sore leg, he went on to win a grueling match
with Ohio State’s Dick Bliss, 5-3, .and beat Jim

Durand of VPI, 8-0.

Ohio State , was the only team which came
close to beating the matmen, but lost, 15-11. Lee
Hall gave another stalwart performance, gain-
ing the necessary points for victory. Ha1l’s de-
feat of Larry McQuerrey gave the matmen .a
15-6, offsetting Bill Bodle’s loss in the heavy-

weight match.

Hall also scored pins against Purdue’s Dave‘

Petree before pinning him in the third period,
and pinned Scott at 1:25 of the ﬁrst period.

“I ﬁgured the competition would be a little
stronger,” said Peery. “As it was, only Ohio
State and Purdue gave us pretty good meets.”
The matmen defeated Purdue, 24-5, and shut
out Virginia Tech, 30-0.

After being mauled by Purdue’s 290-pound
heavyweight Bob Hoop, and being pinned by

Field Events Costly to Track Team

Field events proved deci-
sive as the Cadets of Army
defeated the Panther track
team, 57-42, at the Field
House Saturday afternoon.

Army scored eighteen im-
portant points by sweeping the
35-pound weight throw and the
pole vault. Bob Gaffney tossed
the 35-pound weight well enough
for a second place but fouled on
the throw,

Pole vaulter Mort Stanﬁeld had
similar troubles. _“I really felt
strong as an ox today,” he said,
“but I kept going right through
the bar.” Army pole vaulters have
not been scored upon all season,
as they have swept all three
places in every meet.

The biggest surprise to the Ca-
dets was Jim Flanigan, who won
the shot put with a toss of 50
feet nine inches, the best toss of
his career, and good enough to
break the varsity record of 50
feet six inches set. by Al Thom-
assey. A

Runners Bill DelVecchio con- "

tinued the track team’s assault
on record times, setting a new
Field House record in the 600-
yard run for the second time in
three meets. The time was 1:11'.7,
breaking his own mark of 1:12.5.

Perez Sparks Gymn asts Win

The sharply improved per-
formances of sophomore Ig
Perez was the difference in
the Panthers’ close victory,
631/g-561/g, over former gym-
nastics’ nemesis Navy, Sat-
urday at the Field House.

Perez, hampered in the be-

‘S  ‘ginning of the season by a wrist
’ injury, appears to be fully re-

   

covered now. Against the Mid-

-. -u\.-..

shipmen, he took ﬁrst place on
the parallel bars and long horse,
placed second behind teammate
Dave McKinnis in the ﬂoor exer-
cises, -and tied for third with
Jim Sacco on the still rings.

Perez scored only nine points
in four events against a much
easier team, Slippery Rock, in the
ﬁrst meet of the season. He
scored 19 points Saturday.

McKinnis, in addition to his
ﬁrst in the ﬂoor exercises, rated
second on the still rings and
third on the side horse.

meet, however, 57-42.

DelVecchio collapsed as he broke
the tape to nip Rance Farrell in
the most exciting race of the
afternoon.

Flanigan and DelVecchio were
not the only record breakers.
Both Luddy Hayden, in the 60-
yard hurdles, and Dick Crout, in
the 50-yard dash, tied Field
House Records to win their
events. The mile relay team cap-
ped the record making afternoon
by bettering the mark of 3:23.0
set in the Kent State meet two
weeks ago. Dick Crout built up a
lead in the opening quarter mﬂe
that neither Fred Poellnitz, run-
ning second, nor Bill DelVecchio,

nor anchor man Luddy Hayden,
relinquished. The record time was
3:22.4.

Dave Eichenlaub led all the
way in the two-mile run as ‘he
and teammate Damien Koch tied
to win that event. This was the
third meet in a row that Pan-
ther two milers have ﬁnished

“The meet was decided in the
pole vault and the 35-pound
weight,” said Coach Carl Rees.
“That’s an 18 to zero score, an
almost insurmontable lead in a

needed some points in both
events to win the meet.”

making
sense

You hear a lot of talk
nowadays that doesn’t
have much behind it.
Ideas and words that
sound OK but don't bear
close examination.

Life insurance planning
calls for intelligent
thinking, not glib talk.
Recommendations
should be made only
«after a thorough study
of the client's personal
situation.

If you'd like to talk with
someone who puts
these principles into
practice, then call us.
You’ll see for yourself
what we mean by
making sense.

Dale Anderson
B.A., Wiltenberg University

Ford Motor

Cmpany is:

At many companies the opportunity to work.on

challenging projects comes after many years of '
apprenticeship and a few grey hairs. Not so at

Ford Motor Company where your twenties can

be a stimulating period. There are opportunities

to prove your worth early in your career. Dale

Anderson’s experience is a case in point.

After receiving his B.A. in Physics in June, 1962,

Dale joined our College Graduate Program and

was assigned to our Research Laboratories.

Recently he was given the responsibility for cor-

recting cab vibration occurring on a particular
type of truck. His studies showed that tire eccen-

tricity was the cause of the trouble. Since little change could be effected
in tire compliance, his solution lay in redesigning the suspension system.
Tests of this experimental system show the problem to be reduced to an

insigniﬁcant level.

That’s typical of the kind of meaningful assignments given to employee
while still in the College Graduate Program—regardless of their career
interest. No “make work” superﬁcial jobs. And, besides offering the oppor-
tunity to workpon important problems demanding fresh solutions, we offer
good salaries, a highly professional atmosphere and the proximity to

leading universities.

Discover the rewarding opportunity Ford Motor Company may have for
you. How? Simply schedule an interview with our representative when he
visits your campus. Let your twenties be a challenging and rewarding time.
