Children’s Hospital officials were
surprised last week when the Health
Systems Agency’s Allegheny,Coun—
cil rejected a plan to build a new
l3-story building.

Council voted l4to l3 againstthe
proposal, but, according to Harold
Luebs, executive officer at Child-
ren’s Hospital, the sub-committee,
charged with reviewing the project,

voted unanimously in favor of the
plan.

Despite the setback, officials are
confident that the plan will eventu-
ally be accepted when the full HSA
board meets on July 28.

“We have every reason to expecta
positive vote," Luebs said. “The
facility we live in now is impractical
and old, we are having problems
with health care for children, and l
just can’t imagine them coming back
with anything but an approval.”

For Children‘s Hospital to begin
construction of a new facility they
must submit their plans to the HSA
for a lengthy series of review proce-
dures. If the project is accepted at
the HSA board meeting next week it
will then be reviewed by the state
Health Department. According to
Leub, the earliest date to begin the
project would be sometime at the
end.of August. '

After the Allegheny Council vote,
Edwin Scheetz Jr., Children's Hos-
pital’s board president, told the
group that any delay in implement-
ing the plan would mean a sharp-
hike in construction costs. Luebs
said that escalation costs could run
as high as $700,000 a month.

The building will include the Uni-
versity Health Centers shared servi-
ces facility, a section for use by

Presbyterian Hospital, and addi-'

tional space for Children's Hospital.
The “ cost for the entire project,
including financing costs, will total
$127,250,000.

Because the University of Pitts-
burgh is involved as the backer ofa
-$60 million bond issue for the shared
services project, Senior Vice Chan-

cellor for Administration Jack Free-
man said that “at this. point we're
interested in on-lookers.”

A “slimmer-and trimmer” Pitt is
forecasted for the '80s by academic
administrators‘ who recently
attended a three-day planning work-
shop in West-Virginia. V '

The workshop, which was held-
July 8-10 and funded by the-‘Bu-hl

Foundation, was a series of discus-A

sions on the need for improvenfent
of management techniques andf‘-the
setting of priorities in the universi-
tY’s changing environment. . 

According to Chancellor Wesley’

Posvar at last week’s Senate Council
meeting, the workshop concluded
.that an improved “slimmer and
trimmer” Pitt could be achieved in
part by “sharing and combining

resources among a department or ‘
groups of departments,” rather than

bycutting or weakening programs.
Decreases in both funding and

undergraduate enrollment will '

change the university's economic
enviroment in the ’80s.

\Noting that the funding outlook
for Pitt over the ‘next five years is
‘“not one of growth,“ Posvar also

A added that there are no signs of state _
funding ever matching the rate of

inﬂation in the years to co_me. How-
ever, private funding for research

and high quality programs is pre- V

dicted to, increase.

While the undergraduate enroll-
ment in the College of Arts. and
Sciences will decrease overall, in cer-

tain areas such as engineering and 0

computer science, enrollment is

expectedto continue growing. '

Picking Up
The Tab

[[1 the eaﬂy 19603, economist John Kenneth Galbraith
declared that America had arrived in the“Age of Afﬂuence.”
No longer would the question be one of how to distribute
scarce resources, but how to manage growing wealth. The
message of this proclamation was revealing: we had over-
achieved ourselves, and now must decide not between the
different classes of poor, but varying castes of the rich and
not-so-rich.

Time has proven Galbraith premature, if not totally
wrong. While poverty remains, and the economy far from
stable,we are left with a wide gulf between rich and poor-
the really rich and the very poor. This is not mere theory: the
recent growth in hospital costs offers a practical example.

Children’s Hospital,one of the members of the University
Health System, has applied for a building permit to con-
struct a I3-story expansion to the existing facility. The pro-
posal was narrowly rejected by the governing Health Sys-
tems Agency, but officials at Children’s expect approval
when the full HSA board meets on July 28. ,

The expansion is needed, authorities at the hospital con-
tend, because the present building is “impractical and old;”
the hospital is “having problems with the health care of the
children,” and apparently the answer lies in more and better
equipped space. '

By this reasoning, a lot of hospitals in the area are having
the same problems and finding the same answers. In the past
few years, Allegheny General, St. Francis, Mercy, Columbia
Health System, and other local hospitals have all undergone
major reconstruction and expansion. It is assumed that these
hospitals felt the same need to build as Children’s, and for
the same pressing reasons.

Yet the effect is more than physical. For every new build-
ing or reconstruction, the costs are being passed on to
patients. The Children's Hospital expansion alone will send
thecost of a room to $942 per day. While part of the building
budget may be subsidized, the increased staff and
equipment—-bringing even more increased costs—are not.
The correlation between rising costs and spiraling expansion
is not coincidental. '

_ lt is wrong to assume, however, that these hospitals are
simply profit-motivated. The problem is far more complex
than that. Instead, most hospitals are primarily interested in
improving health care——the costs of new and better machin-
ery and adequately-trained personnel are expensive but
necessary items.

ln fact, this paradox has no easy solution. Yet it needs
addressed: hospital visits are not luxury cruises but an essen-
tial prefix to well-being. The ethical (and perhaps moral)
question is how to adequately serve an aging society without
forcing them into bankruptcy.

The underlying thesis begs the question: is health care a
right? if so, who picks up the tab? Perhaps we are creating a ,
society of very rich and very poor——the poorcan pay for
‘ their health with government money,-and th,e”rich with"their -

Welcome Back To The 1960s

By MARK COLLINS
Pitt News Staff Wriler

l spent three months of I980
working for Ted Kennedy, under the
guise of an internship bequeathed by
this very university. I was not a big
Kennedy fan—nor am I now—but
given the choices of last year’s race,
it seemed the only option.

What I didn't realize was that the
death of the Kennedy campaign
would also signal the death ofliberal
leadership in this country. Demo-
cratic liberals, fed up with the inef-
fectual Carter Presidency, were sud-
denly given no alternative but to stay
home. They’ve remained there ever
since.

As l sat in the back of the
Kennedy trailer in New York, I lis-
tened to the funeral knell ofthe cam-
paign. Speakers from the Kennedy
camp stood and spoke of “courage"
and “the odds"—-placating cam-
paign workers who had given up
their jobs and families for nine
months to work here. One delegate
from New Jersey, however, was
unmoved by the compliments.

“Ladies and gentlemen,” he
began, “I have disagreed with the
Senator (Kennedy) many times. He
is a little too extreme at times, a little
too liberal. But that man out there
now (Carter) is a Republican. I have
nothing in common with him —and
l’m not entirely sure that we share
the same party anymore. And if I
feel that way, and I’m a moderate,
then I don’t know what the hell will
happen to the rest of you. My God,
my God, what has happened to us?
What now?”

The liberal left in this country has
taken a forced vacation. Occasion-
ally they’ll send postcards from their
vacationlands, promising a glorious
return in four years. Somehow,
though, these promises smack of
blind bravado.

I’m a good sport. The Democrats
were defeated last year, not by a
fluke, but by a well-run Republican
race and a smart candidate—whose
views apparently reflect the majority
of opinion in this country. Yet Presi-
dent Reagan and his aides keep ref-
erring to the “mandate of the
election.” The implication, of

course, is that the margin of victory -

was a divine proclamation of
support.

This, is not the case." A little more
than half the voting population in

, this country went to the polls in

l980, and Reagan carried a little
more than half of this vote. Simple
math tells us that more than half of
the country didn‘t vote for Reagan.
One could argue, I suppose, that if
people don't register or fail to vote,
they are subject to the consequences.
This seems legitimate—but taken to
its logical end, this reasoning implies
that voters shouldn't be represented.
Arguments for and against
required voting are embittered and

longstanding—and superﬂous to ’a ‘

fault. The fact remains that thereare
people in this country who feel they
are not being represented. While
business prospers and the GOP
basks in victory, it is easy to forget
that some people are not worried
about interest rates, but about eat-
ing; that some cannot afford to get

sick because their Medicaid benefits I

are threatened; and some people-
students here at Pitt—'are wonder-
ing about paying for tuition when
the college loan program is cut.
These are not people “out there.“ but

your Uncle Harry and mycousin ',
v Slini.Theseare

  

a damaging characterization of the
Reagan administration. Past admin-
istrations, both Democrat and
Republican, have had only limited
success against poverty and
strengthening welfare programs.
But giving the GOP the leadership in
this country does not mean that dis-
sent should stop. All democracies
operate on the basis of minority
representation, not on the basis on
have and have-nots. Yet Reagan’s
economic plan, which effectively
turns away'from thirty years of
social reform in this country, will
probably pass both chambers of
Congress, including the Democratic
House.

What has happened? The issue of
an opposition party is non-partisan:
a lack of leadership in dissent can
turn a benign, bi-partisan govern-
ment into autocracv. When those in

this country who feel misrepresented
begin to feel the pressure of cut-
backs, they will rise against it——and
no leadership will be necessary then.
One need only to look at England to
find the effects of extreme conserva-
tive fiscal policies on the
unemployed.

Perhaps I'm paranoid. Perhaps
this is a sour grapes attitude from a
very tired and defeated liberal. But
revoltis not impossible in this or any
other government, especially in one
that has grown so content in victory.
The problems remain formany, and
unless they are addressed—either by
effective leadership from the left, or
compromise from the Reagan
administration—these issues
threaten to explode. Deja vu—-
welcome to the 1960s.

Med School

In a recent audience that l was
permitted with the Chancellor, l
learned that Dr. Posvar anticipates
another major increase in medical
school tuition next year, one that
will be at least as large as the one we
have just experienced. Perhaps the
prospects of five digit tuition for in-
state freshman will shake the faculty
from the indifference if their Great
Sleep. Lyndon Johnson would have

' seen a moral to some of this: if you

let the Dean reinburse your checking
account for air fare to lran and hotel
bills in exotic foreign capitals, he
will forever have your pansies in his
pocket. How can a professor and
potential critic of the administration
who has benefited to the extent of
$5,000 from the Dean’s largesse,
later criticize the Dean for getting us
into such a tuition mess? Similarly,
how can the clinical faculty prom-
ised substantial pay increases out of
practice plan funds be expected to
speak out in favor of diverting
revenues" from such practice plans
from their own, pockets to the
Dean's office thereby obviating the
need for astronomical tution fees?
Faculty members on the lower
campus, in Chemistry, Biology and
the Humanities Departmentswho
are suffering from the annual diver-
sion of 3 million dollars of Pitt
undergraduate tuition fees to bail
out the School of Medicine, cannot
afford to sit idly by while the prac-

tice plans have grown to the point-

where they now generate tens of mil-
lions of dollars per year. A professor
of French or an associate professor
in the Physics Department must
realize that mismanagement of
funds in the Health Center, in arro-
gant disregard of the burden this
places on the lower campus,'means.a
loss of quality and services in their
own programs. All faculty members
must act to return the School of
Medicine to the responsibility cir-
cumscribed by the orbit of the state-
related nature of the University of
Pittsburgh.

Alumni of the School of Medicine
could also play a more active role in
checking the Administrations Gor-

solving self-generated fiscal prob-
lems through tuition increases. They

abandoned by the system. As a

tuition increases, these young people
will have a much greater tendency to

 W,hat’s Left Of The Left?

  All Sides Offer Their Answers

Miles of magnetic tape and an
ocean ofink make their way through
the media machinery each day. In
their finished form they bring us
further details about the death of
liberalism and the rising rightist tide
in America. i

The Congressional Club and the
Moral Majority mobilize millions of
dollars to throw against unpalatably
liberal politicians.

Television preachers initiate grass
roots attacks on a broad “moral"
front that stretches from abortion to
the rights of homosexuals.

The liberal is on the run, and the
leftist. radicals have been banished
from the land.

What is one to do if one‘s persua-
sions are parlor pink, or if one‘s
ideals concern social justice, peace,
and the problems of poverty?

The present condition of the left,
its various elements, and promises of
either hope or hell for a society can

only be determined by understand-

ing its nature. Often, the essence of
leftist policy lies behind a bulwark of
distortion and misunderstanding.
To get beyond the surface it is useful
to look into the past.

The distinction between liberals
and conservatives has been made for
almost three hundred years. In the
Enlightenment, social and political
theorists believed that man’s powers
of reason could be applied to the
problems of environment.

The French Revolution was the
first conscious attempt to‘ apply
rationalist theories to actual social
conditions. Edmond Burke, reacting
to the revolutionary excesses of the
French, fathered modern conserva-
tism. At the same time, the theories
of Adam Smith outlined the embry-
onic form of liberalism. In a short
time, the familiar pattern of antago-
nism between the traditionalist right
and the visionary revolutionists of
the left could be seen in most socie-
ties of Europe and North America.

The idealism of the liberal, ofcourse
fell somewhere in the middle, usu-
ally caught in the cross-fire.

By the twentieth century, ele-
ments of the political spectrum were
still set in a precarious tension rela-
tive to one another, but their forms
had changed as a result of matura-
tion and the growing complexity of
the environments in which they
existed. The conservative, particu-
larly in America, seemed more like
the classic Smithian liberal of the
eighteenth century. He advocated
free trade, little government interfer-
ence, and the virtues of capitalism.
The liberal became a proponent of
the welfare state and the corporate
industrial economy. The radical,
now armed with the the theories of
Marxist-Leninism, could explain
the conditions of society in terms of
class conflict, and draw the conclu-
sion that the only Basis for the har-
monious arrangement of .society
rested on the concept of a worker’s
state. i

The realities of day-to-day politi-
cal life in America, and the shifting
fortunes of our economy acted like a
prism on the varieties of ideology.
The compromises that had to be
made, and the difficulties that had to
be overcome separated the three
classic divisions into a multiplicity
of factions, each approaching the
problems of society from aedifferent
angle.

The profiles that follo_w are meant
to illustrate the range of views held
by political actors on the left, and to
display the character of the various
participants as they exist in the
American political environment.

Pittsburgh Councilman Tom Fla-
herty describes himself as a progres-
sive working within the party
machinery of the Democratic Party.
As a member of the city council, he

believes that he can -be an effective
voice for constructive change.

The key‘ to Flaherty’s political
strategy is personal style and a tho-
rough understanding ofthe mechan-
ics and art of politics.

“There is a saying that you have to
learn how to become a politician
before you can become a states-
man," Flaherty said. “It is the little
things, the basics like remembering
someone’s name that gives you the
edge and will get you elected.”

Flaherty is concerned that Rea-
gan 's economic policies, being overt-
ly skewed_ in favor of the upper
classes, will cause severe suffering
for the poor, and place an unfair
burden on the middle and working
classes.

“What separates a liberal from a
conservative is a desire for change,
positive change that can improve the
lot of the so-called have-nots,” Fla-
herty explained, ,

He sees a basic difficulty in
attempting to develop an active con-
stituency because of a wide-spread
nervousness on the part of most peo-
ple when faced with the possibility of
any sort of change. As a conse-
quence, his approach calls for the
politician to be a strong leader, a
person-with a clear vision and the

capability of translating it into.

action.

“In my opinion, the man who best
exemplified this type of leader was
Jack Kennedy,” Flaherty said. “He
had the charisma and he knew how
the game was played.

“Kennedy was the only one who
could propose civil rights legislation

and then get the Daley machine to D

work with him.”

Holding Kennedy up as an exam-
ple does not mean that Flaherty sub-
scribes to the traditional New Deal
liberal policies. On the contrary, he
sees a need for the'constant up-date
of methods, but it is important that
they are consistant with a set of
ideals.

“That is the problem with the
party today, and it can be very frus-

trating for me,” Flaherty said. “The
party structure, especially in this
town, is stagnant. No new
approaches to problems are being
developed, only reactions‘ to prob’-
lems or policy initiatives of the
opposition.” ’

Flaherty considers the attempts of
independents and third parties to
change the system as wrong-headed
in that they alienate the voters and
fail to put their ideas into-action.

“There are people out there with a
lot of good ideas and we could use
them here on council,” Flaherty
said. “But they just don’t see the
need to become good at politics, and
after all,no matter what system you

have,it is the politician who puts the

policv into action.”

Zingaro a

John Zingaro, neighborhood acti-
vist and Consumer Party candidate
for the Pittsburgh City Council is an
articulate spokesman for burgeon-
ing third party movement.'He con-
siders the Democratic Party,

~traditionally a catch-basin for lib-

eral causes, to be incapable ofimple-
menting effective liberal policies.
“You need to counter the propos-
als of the Reagan administration
with more than your own programs.
You need to counter them with
something that is genuinely going to
accomplish want you want to do,"
Zingaro said. “For example, in
response to supply-side economics,
we need to foster a feeling among
business people and consumers that
they have a voice in the economy.
“The way to do that is by directly
challenging the power of corpora-
tions. Now, no one in_the Demo-
cratic Party is going to do that."
Zingaro believes that the Demo-
crats are hurting themselves by
attempting to appear pragmatic. By
adopting modified Republican
proposals, such as a tax cut,he sees
an abandonment of what have come
to be held as basic liberal ideals.
For Zingaro, the alternative is to
put a greater emphasis on idealogy.
It is important, he maintains, to be
ﬂexible and creative in approaching
a problem, but still arrive at a solu-
tion that is consistent with the ideals

'that motivate that action.

“We don’t have to deal with‘ a
solution in the waysthat they have
always been dealt with,” Zingaro
said. “For example, 1 don’t think
government funding is necessarily a
way to solve poverty, or other classic
problems. I think people are tired of
that approach. Yet I don’t thinl<;peo—
ple a-re tired of ideals such as helping
the poor or supporting organized
labor.”

According to Zingaro, the prob-
lem with distinguishing between a
liberal and a leftist is the relative

quality of the terms. For example,
someone like Daniel P. Moynihan
can be considered a liberal simply

. because the rest of the field is so far

to the right.

“He’s left of right,” Zingaro said,
“but that’s not where l think left is.”

Zingaro looks to three basic issues
that can be used to organize a left
constituency: economic democracy;
issues of the enviroment; and peace.

He says that peace is the most
important because it poses the grea-
test challenge to the way we are used
to thinking. It involves developing
new concepts of security, defensive
needs, and strategic interests.

“The people who could support
these policies are out there,” Zingaro
said, “What we have to do is get
them to realize that there are alter-
natives to the traditional modes of
politics.”

* .’t....?t *

Victor Willem, director of the
Semple Senior Citizens Program
and former candidate for city coun-
cil, thinks that the nature of the left .
is in a state ofchange, and because of
this, there is a great deal of “group-
ing” among its members. ,

Willem sees an emerging concern
with self-actualization and policies
that help fulfill aspects of human
potential.

Yet, whatever the future may hold
for the liberal movement, Willem
believes that its present concerns
center around points of strategy.

“There are two aspects involved
here: electioneering and gover-
nance,” Willem said. “Campaign
politics are very difficult for some-
one who is slightly left of center,
given the power of special interest
groups, if you alienate one of them
you are going to have a verydifﬁcult
time. ‘

“When it comes to governing, you
have a similar problem. Look at
Carter’s attempt to revise the tax
code. He tried to tackle the two?’
martini lunch and the restaurant
industry had a fit.” .

Willem considers government, as
it exists today, to be stagnantand
unmaneuverable. He cites __ the
amount of- mandated programs as
an example of the limited flexability
that any one politician might have.

The best case scenario, for‘ Wil-
lem, is a rather grim picture in which
the middle class become polarized
between rich and~poor, and Rea-
gan’s policies backfire.

“If that is the case, and l’m not
saying that it will happen in the next
five or six years,” Willem said,
“then, I think you will see an increas-
ingly appealing radical party, but

' you will also see an increasingly co‘n-

servative, less democratic party in

Salak

When you ‘re calling for a revolu-
tion, you can't measure success.-
Connie Blomen, 1976 Socialist
Labor Party Vice-presidential can-
didate

Ashes still flicker among the
remains of social programs cut by
President Reagan, and ears still ring
from the proclamations that the vic-
tory represented a “mandate.”

But Progressive Labor Party
member Jerry Salak maintains that
“the entire left is growing.”

Salak said that President Rea-
gan’s economic and military policies
will result in a disaster that can only
strengthen the left.

“Look at what’s happening in Bri- ,

tain,” he said. “Can the U.S. be far
behind?"

The organization of which Salak
is a member - the Progressive Labor
Party — is a revolutionary communist
organization dedicated to over-
throwing the capitalist system and
bringing an end to racism, he said.

“We believe that the whole world
is capitalist, but that capitalism
doesn’t work,” he said. “Capitalism
is on its last leg. The two biggest
capitalist countries in the world, the
United States and Russia, are on the
brink ofa war over who should rule
it.”

According ' to Salak, the U.S.,
which he said is declining as a world
power, developed a plan a few years

ago called “re-industrialization.”
The purpose .of the plan was to
invest money into increasing-Ameri-
ca’s industrial economy and world
standing.

With the advent of the Reagan
administration, the U.S.has shifted
to building its military powers. This,
Salk said, will be a method for the
PLP to strike back at the military.

The youth recruited to fight what
he said is a “rich man’s war” will
“turn their guns on the brass“ and
solidly resist the military, he said.

The PLP also believes that there is
a link between racism and capital-
ism, Salak said. ’

“We think that racism is the key
ingredient to facism,” Salak said. He
believes‘ that racism is perpetuated
by the media and by “professorial
types.”

In 1977, the PLP picketed The
Pittsburgh Press, denouncing it as a
“racist rag” for what the PLP saw as
excessive coverage of Klan
activities.

Salak, along with many other
PLP members, is also active in the
International Committee Against
Racism (INCAR), a group that
receives partial funding from Pitt’s
Student Government Board. Last
winter, INCAR gave speeches,
wrote leters, and passed out litera-
ture denouncing the teaching of
sociobiology at Pitt. They plan to
“be out there” again in the fall if
sociobiology is offered, he said.

   
 
 
 

Salak termed sociobiologyias “a
racist, pseudo-science.” He added
that both the PLP and INCAR have
a right to demand that it not be
taught because “it is full of lies.”

Both groups frequently bust Ku
Klux Klan rallies——recently they dis-
rupted one in Wheeling, West Virgi-
nia—but Salak claims the Klan is
often protected by the police.

The criticism of PLP’s use of vio-
lence to fight racism is offered by
two groups, according to Salak:
those who are somewhat naive and
afraid, and those who don’t want to
defend themselves. I,

Salak became active in the PLP
during the VietNam anti-war move-
ment. He said it is “hard to say” what
exactly drew him to the organiza-
tion, but he believes that it has been
effective because it raises people’s
consciousness of the issues.

The Pittsburgh chapter of the
PLP is relatively small, Salak said.
There are less than I00 members. He
has been active in the PLP for about
I0 years, he said.

The Socialist Worker’s Party
believes working people keep the
country running, so why shouldn’t
they run the country?

That's the view of Kathy Mickells,
chairperson of the Pittsburgh
branch‘ of the Socialist Worker’s
Party (SWP).

The Socialist , Worker’s Party
-thinks that Republicans and Demo-
crats represent only the “ruling
rich,” Mickells said. What the SWP
would like to do is either to give the
working class their own political
party called the Labor Party, or to
have the labor unions run their own
candidates for political office

instead of endorsing someone,’

Mickells said.

The difference between “left”and
“liberal”, according to Mickells, is
that liberals think they can work’out
programs that make concessions to
the working class.

“The working people don’t need a
guardian angel,” Mickells said,
“They can run themselves-."

She cited Democratic senator Ted
Kennedy as an example of what she
said is the ineffectiveness of the lib-
erals. Kennedy said he opposed the
Reagan budget cuts, but voted for
them, and said he supports the
Equal Rights Amendment,.but not
freedom of choice. I

The immediate goal ofthe SWPis
to organize against President Rea-
gan‘s budget cuts, Mickell said.
Whatithe SWP is attemptingto do is
to drum up support for marches and
rallies against the cuts.

Rallies have been held in the past,
however, "and the budget was still

approved. Does the SW1’ stm s-e
rallying as an effective method to
combat reductions in social
programs?

Mickells claims that it is. She said
it was pressure by the working peo-
ple that got the United States out of
Vietnam. This same pressure, she
said, is keeping us out of El Salvador
right now. She believes the rallies are
“very effective" and said they’re
mobilizing the fate of the country.

But the real battle has to be fought
in the political arena, according to
Mickells. She said a candidate ofthe
labor union would be responsible
only to the working people.

[AnaIysis:

There is an element of pathos
in the disparity between political
ideals and political realities. The
idealist,attempting to square
what ought to be with what is, is
often met with frustration. The
process of politics, being an
abrasive sort of activity,
demands a capacity for
compromise.

The landscape of American
politics, the nature of our institu-
tions, voter characteristics,and a
general quality of individualism
that is found in large portions of
the citizenry, works in concert to
form a rugged obstacle course
for the idealogical activist.

In considering the many varie-
ties of leftists, from moderate
left—of-center New Deal Demo-
crats to the most strident Trotsk-
yite, there are three general
models that illustrate their,’
approach to politics.

The first might be called a
revolutionist model, in which the
agent views the political system
as hopelessly unresponsive to the
needs of the masses. He con-
cludes that the system has to be
eliminated ‘and replaced with a
new and higher order. This
model catches most of the
Marxist-oriented factions who
consider a viable range of strate-
gies from armed conflict to alter-
native political parties that aim
at erasing_the existing system.

_ The next two models are
related in that they are both con-
cerned with redesigning certain
elements of the existing system.
They differ on the technical
means of implementing their
‘ programs. I '

The first of these can be called
an outsider model. Within this
arrangement, the agent views the
conventional political machinery
(parties, interest groups, other
institutions that perform linkage

ﬂnctions between citizenry and

Although there is no such candidate I

materializing presently, Mickells
said the labor unions are beginning
to discuss that idea.

To necessitate any changes in the
system she did not discount violence
as a method. But, Mickells said the
violence will. come not from the
working people, but from the United
States government, “a perpetuator
of violence.”

The SWP is currently involved in
a $40 million lawsuit against the
FBI, CIA, and other government
agencies for alleged abuses against
the SWP during the last 40 years,
Mickells said.

Gloomy Outlook For Left

government) as unresponsive to
his. program. The agent con-
cludes that the only viable
avenue for presenting his ideas is
an independent political
machine. This takes into account
most of the alternative political
parties. I

‘ The last model is the insider
scenario, in which the agent rec-
ognizes the existing political
machinery as neutral, or even
responsive to 1: 2 program. He
concludes that hi only hope for
political success .ies within the
bounds of conventional politics.
This model accounts for. the
many varieties of liberal
Democrats. I

Presently, conditions in the
United States seem to favor the
insider model. '

The revolutionist model has
never worked on any regular
basis because of the extremely
negative perception most Ameri-
cans have of it. “

.The outsider model is theoreti- ..
cally viable,given the large
number of independent-voters,
but it seems that there has to be a
change in political or economic
conditions before it becomes via-
ble in fact.

The model that appears most
adaptable to America’s political
landscape is conservative in
nature. . . .

.At all junctures of American
history, when given a choice-
between the status quo and radi-
cal alternative, voters have opted
for the former. The lone excep-
tion was the New Deal period of

intense American liberalism

Latest Basketball Recruit Pursues Sport With Passion

By JOHNETTE HOWARD
Pill News Sports Editor

Trent Johnson, Pitt’s latest and
presumably last basketball recruit,
seems to pursue things one way-
passionately.

Two years ago, Johnson, an All-
State player at Central High School
in Memphis and the city’s Player of
the Year, signed a letter-of-intent to
attend Oklahoma City College. He
then changed his mind and attended
Connors State Junior College in
Oklahoma, making the letter-of-
intent to Oklahoma City unbinding
when he completed his two years.

After those two seasons at Con-
nors State, where he averaged l8
points and ll rebounds per game at
forward and earned first team All-
Conference and All—District JC

 

ROY CHIPMAN

 

honors, the 6-6'/2 Johnson was again
considering heading to Oklahoma
City College so he could stay close to
his girlfriend, who lives in Tulsa.

For a while, basketball wasn’t the
only passion burning in Johnson's
breast, but he continued to be re-
cruited by other four-year colleges,
including Duquesne. Still Johnson
opted to stay in Oklahoma. Pitt
spotted Johnson while recruiting
teammate Roosevelt Kirby, the
Panthers’ first recruit to sign this
year. The others are guards George
Allen and Charles Thompson, and
forwards Andre Williams, and Chip
Watkins.

“We talked to Roosevelt, and

Trent talked to Roosevelt, and then.

thought about it," explained Pitt

head basketball coach Roy Chip-

man. “(Johnson) wanted to stay.

close to his girlfriend in Tulsa, but
then he changed his mind."

Which explains Johnson’s late“

availability despite such impressive
playing credentials. Most recruits
announce their college destinations
near the end of the collegiate season
on into the end of March and early
April, when the last—minute recruit-
ing really heats up.

Chipman was able to offer John-
son a scholarship after center Paul
Brozovich flunked out of school and
transferred to Clarion.

We‘re very fortunate to get a

player of his caliber very late in the
season,” Chipman said. “We didn’t
want to get a mediocre player, but

we wanted to bring in a quality
player, which Trent is.” . .
Chipman described Johnson as a
“good shooter" and very quick for
his 6-6'/2 size. Johnson also has afew
other qualities that caught the Pitt
staff’s attention as they originally
recruited just Kirby. '
“Johnson's biggest asset is aggres-
siveness. We felt we needed that,”'
Chipman _said. Andalthough John-
son played forward at Connors
State, Chipman said “he can play
just about any place. He could play
swingman, or _he could play either
big forward or small forward. He’s

< -an excellent athlete and he runs the

court well."

Passions also run well in Johnson.
Right now, none seem to run deeper '
than basketball.

NFL , Update

Ex-Pitt defensive star Hugh
Green, the Tampa Bay Bucs’ No.
l draft choice, signed a multi-
year contract with the NFL team
last Friday and said he was glad
the negotiations were over.

Green’s agent is Jerry Argo-
vitz, the man who delivered the
Steelers‘ and Miami Dolphins’
No.-_ l picks Keith Gary and
David Overstreet to Montreal of
the Canadian Football League,
but Green said Tampa was the
place he wanted to play. Terms
of the pact were not disclosed.

“Canada was never on my
mind," Green said. “From day
one, l felt good about Tampa."

Green, the Lombardi Trophy
winner and second in last year's
Heisman Trophy voting, said he
expects no problem adjusting to
playing linebacker in the pros
after spending his collegiate
career at defensive end.

The Bucs have ticketed Green
for right outside linebacker, the
same slot that ” former Pitt
defender Cecil Johnson played
last year for Tampa. Johnson
will be shifted to an inside line-
backing spot this year to make
room for Green. _

Green cited his experience as a
standup defensive end at Pitt as a
big plus that will help himswitch
to linebacking in the NFL. Green
said his position at Pitt required
“moving around a lot. So ldon’t

Green Signs With

think it will be a big adjustment."

Green will wear number 53 for
the Bucs, and joins ex-Pitt stars
Johnson, Gordon Jones and
Dave Logan on the Tampa‘
roster. '

Former Pitt Panther Mark
May, the Washington Redskins’
first-round draft pick, signed a
four-year contract yesterday
with the club, ending a week-
long absence from training camp
and spurning the CFL’s Mont-
real Alouettes’ advances.

Last week, the Alouettes
placed May on their negotiating
list after both May’s agent, Pitts-
burgh attorney Ralph Cindrich, '
and Redskin General Manager

Bobby Beathard declared the ‘

talks at an impasse.

Soon afterward, Beathard was
quoted ' in an Associated Press
article saying that perhaps the
Redskins had made a mistake
taking May in the first round
instead of center Russ Grimm, a
Pitt teammate of May’s, who was
Washington’s third-round
selection.

Grimm signed a three-year
deal with the Redskins last week
that his agent and Beatherd are
calling perhaps the richest con-
tract ever for a third-round draft
choice. While the exact terms of
the contract were not disclosed,
reports pegged Grimm's contract

   

last Friday.

at about $l25,000 annually.

Until yesterday, May was hav-
ing no such luck with the Red-
skins, and as late as last week,
Beathard was still taking verbal
swipes at both May and Cin-
drich. Meanwhile, Cindrich was i
busy admitting he had been dis— '
cussing a contract with
Montreal.

“Canada is something you
always consider," Cindrich said,
although he added the market
for offensive linemen in the CFL
is not -as great as it is for players ’
at the skill positions like quarter-
back or running back.

May’s four-year contract,
although the terms were not
announced, is estimated to be
around $600,000, not including

Hugh Green (lefti and is agentwilerry rgovitz agreed to terms with the NBL’s Tampa Bay Bucs  i

May_was the last of Pitt's l2. ' ‘
NFL draftees to agree to terms.
Last Friday, as Hugh_Green was
announcing his signing with
Tampa Bay, Pitt teammate Ben-
jie Pryor came to terms with the
Cincinnati Bengals. Pryor was
the Bengals’ ﬁfth-round pick. '
Other Pitt player signings in
the last week were Grimm and
defensive lineman Greg Meisner,
the Los Angeles Rams‘ third-
round pick. A
Ex-Pitt cornerback Terry,
White, who was trying to latch
onto the Atlanta Falcons as a.
.free agent, was cut by the team
Monday. "Despite the setback, -
