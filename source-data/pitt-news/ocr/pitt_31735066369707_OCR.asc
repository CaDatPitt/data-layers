Community College Administrator Named Director

By JEFF COUCH
Pitt News Staff Writer

After a three-month nationwide
search and an intensive interview-
ing process, Andy Smith was, last
week appointed Pitt’s new director
of student activities by. Vice
Chancellor for Student Affairs
Conney Kimbo. 1‘

Smith, currently director of
student activities at Community
College of Allegheny County,
Allegheny Campus will assume his
duties at Pitt August 13.

Smith was one of four finalists
recommended for the position by a
search committee consisting of
students, faculty, and administra-

tors created to choose a successor
to former director Willard ‘.‘Bud"
Heaps, who resigned last year.
Members of the student activi-
ties staff and students involved in
the search process» gave :Smith
“higher marks” than any ,'of the
candidates, according to‘ Kimbo. ,
“He is a very highly ‘acceptable
candidate,” Kimbo said. “He’s a
very good man with; skills in
student activities, programming
and student union management.”
In an interview Monday with the
Pitt News, Smith said the univer-

sity has unlimited potential be-

cause of its “large student union,
ideal location, and large student
activities staff.” :

“The opportunity is there,” he
said. “Pitt has the biggest
potential to do an amazing amount
of tremendous things.”

“My talks with students. indica-
ted they are ready to push back the
boundaries, to be more progressive
and more productive,” he added.

Smith’s experience at Commun-
ity College‘ of Allegheny County,
where he worked closely with
students, will be of tremendous
value to him at Pitt, he said.
Student interaction with the stu-
dent activities staff, he added, will
be a high priority.

‘‘I have no intention whatsoever
to hide behind a large, well-trained
staff,” he said. 

A local fireman scales the Cathedral of Learning early Friday morning after a fire broke out in the kitchens of
Burger Chet. Damage was minor and the tire was brought under control quickly. ‘Below, students, staff and
local residents survey the scene of the tire.

“The university is fully
committed to complying with
the President's energy conser-
vation program and helping to
alleviate this country's energy
problems,” according to a
bulletin from the office of
Joseph Dutton, vice chancellor
for business and finance.

The guidelines will be
difficult to monitor, especially
in offices with window. air

conditioning units, according to _

for a criminal offense. _

Ed Permar, manager of Mech-
anical Systems and Energy
conservation.

“It depends on the people
working in the area to abide by
the president’s law,” Permar
added.

Violations of the energy
directive are subject to ﬁnes by
the federal government in-
cluding $5000 per day for a civil
offense, and $10,000 per day

   .. 

“Everything the office (student
activities) does will be open to
students,” Smith added. “I don't
know any other way to handle it.”

Student activities should provide
learning experiences for students
through involvement in decision
making, thus helping the people
involved to “learn and grow,”
according to Smith.

Related to this philosophy is the
importance of the decision-making
process involved in a student
program or activity, rather than the
“end product,” Smith said.

Once Smith assumes his new
position at Pitt, a period of
“ evaluation and assessment of

programs, staff and all facets of the
student activities program” will
begin, he said. Concurrently,
directions for the student activities
program will be formulated with
the help of students and staff, he
added.

The key to a successful student
activities program, according to
Smith, are the students.

“The students make the differ-
ence,” he said. “If students want
something to happen, it will
happen.”

“Students don't have to expect 1
anything less than excellence from I

the student activities program,” he
added.

Middle A ges

Still Here
For Group

By PATTY TASCARELLA
Pitt News Staff Writer

Once a month, Kevin Bold "of
Allison Park, a 1978 Pitt graduate
with a major in psychology, is
Caeahainn Osuilleabhainn (pro-
nounced Kevin 0’Sullivan), a
Gaelic minstrel of pre-1650 Ireland.

Confusing? Actually Bold, or
more actually, Osuilleabhainn, is a
member of the Holder of the
Golden Key of The Barony-Marche
of the Debatable Lands. The
Barony is a chapter of The Society
for Creative Anachronism, a
national organization founded as a
non profit educational organization
in the mid 19605.

“You know, an anachronism is
something that is out of its time,”
explained Bold. “What the group
does is: we're into what was going
on in the Middle Ages and the
Renaissance.”

Structurally, the SCA is sub-
divided into kingdoms, principal-
ities baronys, shires and cantons.
The Pittsburgh chapter is desc-
ribed as the debatable lands for
good cause, according to Bold.

“When this chapter was formed,
the Middle Kingdom (the Penn-
sylvania-Ohio border) and the
Eastern Kingdom (the east coast
from Canda to South Carolina) had
a war" over who would get
Pittsburgh,” Bold said. “We are
in the East Kingdom but each year
since, there is a war held at
Cooper’s Lake in Zelianople.”

The rest of the name is in honor
of the Pittsburgh group’s Baron--a
viking named Leonard the Young-
er. It is one of the rules of the CSA
that members invent an alter ego of
the Middle Ages. Caeahainn
Osuilleabhainn, created initially by
Bold in January with further
character development a contin-
uing process, is one of the more
normal members of the club,
despite the confusion of the Gaelic
spelling. Consider, say, Foolish
Andrew, the jester, or Yang the
Nauseating.

“You become someone who
might have existed,” said Bold.
“You can't corneas 

  

who knew him. We have desert
thieves, wenches and ladies.
No leprechauns, but we have one
elf named Brenna. There are no
Oliver Cromwell fans that I can
think of, but there are minstrels,
noble folk, rogues and sorcerors.
Quite a collection and we always
have a good time.”

Good times include the weekly
meetings held in Pitt’s student
union—“We meet at Pitt because a
lot of the members are Pitt
students”—where the turnout
usually numbers somewhere be-
tween 40 and 60 people.

“After the meeting, we have
Renaissance dancing,” said Bold.
“Not too many people would come
if all we did was talk business, so
we get business out of the way and
dance."

There are quests which are a sort
of obstacle course with a catch-—
“There was a set up where you had
to ﬁght someone who was guarding

the only weapon that could kill‘

him.

There are feasts where members
of the Barony eat Middle Age
staples, like trenchers——“A sort of
round bread thing that’s an edible
plate”—and quaff, home brewed
mead, legendary drink of Beowulf
made of fermented honey.

Bold said that the creation of a
midievel identity serves as a sort of
Anglo-Irish “Roots.”

“Most of us were brought upon
Robin Hood and King Arthur,” he

said, “but in high school,
whenever they talk about myths,
it’s always Greek or Roman.

It’s refreshing, doing the research
for your character, because you
read the myths of your own
ancestors.”

“In terms of personal psycho-
logy,” he continued, “Everyone
needs some sort of harmless
frivolity. For a lot of people, SCA
ﬁts the bill. It’s no sillier than
belonging to alodge and certainly

A Positive
Change

The appointment last week of Andy Smith as the
new director of student activities is a welcome one
indeed, promising a needed overhaul of the student
activities program and_possibly the student activities
staff itself.

Because he is new and not a member of the univer-
sity family, Smith should enter his new position
without preconceived notions or prejudices about the
Pitt organizations and student programs which have
suffered over the years due to lack of direction and
inconsistent policies. Instead of basing decisions on
heresay or gossip, Smith must evaluate each program
or organization objectively, based on his own resear-
ch and actually talking with involved students.

This is not say the student activities staff has been
totally negligent in their development of student
programs or their . consultations with student
organizations. On the contrary, since Associate
Director Terri Milani began managing the depar-
tment, it has changed from an uncaring, negative of-
fice to one that listens and appreciates student needs.

Guest column

However, the student activities office needs an out-
srder, like Smith, to evaluate and institute changes.

Keeping this in mind, Smith must act swiftly, yet
carefully to ascertain student needs through intensive
interviews with students and act to meet those needs.

There are‘a number of areas that need immediate
evaluation and action.

First, the student union rennovation project,
which has been pushed by the office of student ac-
tivities, does not receive the same high priority in the
Cathedral. Smith must study the project, make his
own recommendations and push it through the
bureaucracy.

It is disgraceful that a major university like Pitt,
has a student union is such horrible condition.
Schenley Hall is neither pleasant to walk through nor
conducive to a strong student activities program.
One walk through Penn State’s or even Duquesne’s
student Union affirms the fact that Pitt’s Union is
inferior.

Second, a wider variety of programming represen-
ting a greater cross section of Pitt students must be
achieved immediately. Although the Pitt Union
Program Council has shown some improvement
programming-wise, it leaves much to be desired.
Administrators have hindered its growth by not
allowing it to program major concerts or lectures,
both of which students have expressed interest in.

Third, the majority of students at Pitt are com-
muters. They come to campus in the morning, attend
classes, sit in the Commons Room, and leave only to
arrive the following morning to face the same.
Commuters need to become a part of this campus
through more programs directed toward their in-
terests.

Fourth, what has happened to Pitt’s proposed
open air FM radio station? WYEP, an Oakland
based educational station, has its broadcast tower
perched atop the Cathedral, yet Pitt’s station is still
in the planning stages, stymied by lack of committ-
ment from the university senior staff. '

Smith must put some adrenilin into the open air
proposal and let the administration know how im-
portant and complimentary the FM facility would be
to Pitt.

Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, the at-
titudes of the student activities staff must be
examined and changed immediately. In the past few
years, certain staff members have developed negative
attitudes toward their jobs and toward each other.
In order to work efficiently and effectively, Smith
must pull together his staff to pursue common goals
without regard to personalities.

This is an important obstacle for Smith to hurtgle

’ in order to institute the changes in student activities.

Without immediate action concerning this problem,
Smith’s appointment will prove fruitless, a waste of
time and effort.

In short, Smith has a tough job ahead of him.
Not only must be overhaul existing programs and
wipe out current problems; he must also institute new
programs to put his office back on top of things.
We hope that all students and administrators can
bury their prejudices, disregard past attitudes, and
help Smith place the Student Activities Office on the
right track.

Lifting of Sanctions to

Legitimize Racism?

By JOHN HESS

Rhodesia held its elections this past
April and at ‘r’.-..-it man, Bishop Abel
Muzorewa, now heads the war-torn
country called Zimbabwe-Rhodesia.
(Ironically, 90 percent of Zimbabwe
has already been liberated and is under
the control of the Patriotic Front.)

The 1978 Case Javits amendment
requires President Carter to lift the
economic sanctions on Rhodesia, if he
assesses the elections of the new
majority-rule government to be free?
Were the elections free and fair? Are
blacks and whites now equal?

To start with, the voting took place
under the guidelines of the I978 con-
stitution which was voted on by whites
only and insures their privileged status.
The British Parliamentary Committee
which was sent to Rhodesia to observe
and evaluate the elections called it a
“game without rules.”

There was no voter registration, and
so many under-aged blacks, as well as
migrant labor blacks from Malawi,
Mazambique, and Zambia were per-
mitted to vote. There was evidence of
coercion of domestic employees, and
farm and mine workers by their em-
ployers to vote. Mobile voting stations
went to prisons and protected villages
to “enable” blacks to vote.

The rural black peasants which
comprise 80 percent of the population
are still living under the same op-
pressive conditions as they did when

I the name of their country's president

Smith. The constitution of the
“majority rule” government is
designed to keep things that way. If
one of the newly elected black
representatives were to bring up a bill
to really help the blacl: masses (such as
land reform), in order to pass it would
need the vote of all 72 black represen-
tatives and six out of the 28 white
representatives—all of whom are
dedicated to the perpetuation of white
privilege. Hardly majority rule.

So, if the elections did not install a
black government that would help the
black people—what were they for? The
conclusion of the British Parliamen-
tary Committee was that the elections
were a fraud designed to sell the in-
ternal settlement to the world com-
munity for the purpose of lifting the
sanctions.

To this end, Muzorewa, Smith, et.al.
have been largely successful. In May,
the U.S. Senate passed a non-binding
resolution calling for President Carter
to end the embargo. On June 8, Carter
announced that he would refuse to lift
the sanctions. Just four days later, the
Senate voted 52-41 to retain an amen-
dment which would overturn Carter's
decision. ’

Those Senators leading the push to
lift sanctions are among the most reac-
tionary in Congress. However, we
must not view Carter's stand as arising
from progressive interests in the well-
being of the Zimbabwean people. His
decision is based on political and
economic interests which U.S. im-
perialism has at stake. Recognition of
Muzorewa’s ‘puppet regime would

severely damage the iU.S.’s [already
badly tarnished image in the natural
resource-rich third world.

Forty-nine African countries have
passed a resolution in the U.N.
Security Council demanding that no
country recognize the new regime in
Salisbury. Among those African coun-
tries is Nigeria, which supplies 12 per-
cent of the annual U.S. crude oil im-
ports, and is our largest supplier of im-
ported gasoline-quality crude oil. The
Nigerian government has delivered an
indirect threat of retaliation to Carter
if sanctions are lifted, stating that they
would find an “appropriate response’
if such action was taken. By acting too
quickly on the sanctions question, Car-
ter also risks alientation the black vote,
which was instrumental in putting him
in office in 1976.

Carter’s position should not be
viewed as one in opposition to the
repeal of sanctions, but as a strategic
decision to delay that repeal. It was
Carter's friends in the House Foreign
Affairs committee who unanimously
voted to give him until October 15 to
make a decision. This way he would
not have to lift sanctions before
Britain, which still claims legal
authority over Rhodesia.

By postponing a decision until Oc-
tober, he would let Margaret That-
cher’s conservative government in
Britain take the initial heat. Carter
could use the time to pressure
Muzorewa to clean up his act in the
face of international opinion. Also, by
October the crisis at the gas pumps
should cool down, somewhat defusing

the possibility of Nigerian retaliation. ~

The lifting of sanctions will not stop
the intense fighting of the Patriotic
Front for the liberation of their coun-
try. Nor will it stop the peoples’ sup-
port of the guerrillas, because, for the

people, nothin has changed, and they

still have everything to gain by Q.

fighting.

Lifting of sanctions will make life a
bit more pleasant for the new gover-
nment both politically and
economically. Politically, it will
legitimize the racist government. It
will boost the prestige of the country.
If the U.S. lifts sanctions, other coun-
tries will follow suit. Although cor-
porations have been trading with
Rhodesia illegally ever since sanctions
were imposed (Britain has been sup-
plying Rhodesia’s oil needs, while U.S.
helicopters are being used against the

With the lifting of sanctions, loans, aid
and foreign investments will flow
freely into Zimbabwe-Rhodesia.

The whole scenario created by the
lifting of sanctions must be seen again-
st this backdrop: nearly all of the rural
areas have been liberated; the freedom
fighters have now stepped up their at-
tack on strategic urban centers. As of
May 23, Umtali, the third largest city
in Zimbabwe, was under bombar-
dment by the Front’s forces. An end to
the embargo could only temparily in-

- convenience the Zimbabwean People’z;;-

struggle for liberation. As A.M.
Chicoda, a Zanu representative, said
recently, “The armed struggle will con-
tinue no matter what these countries
(Britain and theU.S.) decide,” and th

struggle will be victorious. _ - e 4 V.
