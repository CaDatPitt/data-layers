Undergraduate business
school delayed for a year

Kelly A. Hanna
Staff Writer

The opening of the new Pitt under-
graduate College of Business
Administration has been delayed until
August 1995. Although Pitt’s Board of
Trustees voted last July to begin
enrolling students by August 1994, Pitt
Chancellor J. Dennis O’Connor said
more time is needed for planning and
preparation.

Additional time is needed to select a
site for the new ‘school, to hire addition-
al faculty, and to satisfy other more
pragmatic, technical concerns, accord-
ing to interim Provost Mark
Nordenberg. O’Connor said he based
his decision to delay the opening on the
recommendation from Nordenberg.

O’Connor characterized the original

plan to enroll the fust class in 1994 as a .

“very ambitious one,” and said that “the

new implementation date, while agreed
[upon] with reluctance, would ensure
that the University’s commitment to the
undergraduate program would result in
the best program possible.”

O’Connor said that he is allowing the
delay because he wants to make sure
that the undergraduate school matches
the excellence of the graduate program.

“Particularly with the additional time
and energy that we will devote to it in

_the interim, I know that the opening of

the CBA in August of 1995 will mark the
inauguration of a highly desirable pro-
gram for the University of Pittsburgh
and for the constituencies that we

serve,” O’Connor said.

Students of the Katz Graduate School
of Business said the additional time is
needed because the resources do not
seem ample enough thus far.

“I think the undergrad program is a

Organ distribution policy
decreases liver transplants

By Brian Lehew
Staff Writer

An organ distribution policy institut-
ed in 1991 has resulted in increased
deaths and a decrease in liver trans-
plants at the University of Pittsburgh
Medical Center. 9‘

In 1990, 46 people died while on the
liver transplant wa-iting list at the
UPMC. In 1992, under the new policy,
the number increased to 91. The UPMC
performed 74 fewer liver transplants in
1992 than in 1990 for essentially the
same reasons. Figures for 1993 are
unavailable.

UNOS, the non—profit organization
which handles organ procurement and
distribution for the government, enact-
ed the policy, which places all organ
candidates on regional rather than
national waiting lists for organs.

Sharing justifies the regional lists by

The United Network for Organ

arguing that the distance between
transplant centers makes it unfeasible
to successfully ship organs between
them. “There are a lot of factors that
must be considered  like urgency,
preservation and transport, equity and
the difficulties associated with suitably
matching patients to organs,” said
UNOS spokesperson Joel Newman.

According to the policy, there are 69
regions in the United States. Available
organs are only given to the most criti-
cal, or. “status four” patients, if they can-
not be used first in the region in which
they were donated, regardless of
whether or not the organ can be suc-
cessfully shipped.

The winter term brings new leadership for the Panhellenic
Association, but it will continue to concentrate on services
stressed in the past.

New officers were elected to the Panhellenic Association on
Nov. 14 and will begin their tenns in office at the first of next
year. Between now and Christmas break, the outgoing officers
plan to meet with incoming officers to explain responsibilities
and share experiences to insure a smooth transition.-

“Because most people will be busy with finals, and going
home early for [Christmas] break, it’s hard to get enough peo-
ple together for activities during that time,” said Julie A.
Holaren, the outgoing external vice president. ’

Using a new training program designed by current President
Loraine Shipley, the outgoing officers will meet with the
incoming officers individually at least three or four times
before December finals. Holaren said the officers will have to
go into the meetings with a detailed outline, stating what will
be covered in the meeting. The outline insures that something
has been discussed and accomplished with the meetings, she

Committee- will review appeal regarding Pasquale

By Matt Grorf A 8
Asst. News Editor _

The Student Government
Board Judicial Committee will
review -appeals filed last week
in reference to SGB president-
elect Ross Pasquale’s hearing on
November 18. .1
 Laura Auerbach, oneof two
poll workers who initially
reported Pasquale’s SGB
Elections “Code violations, con-
firmed she. is’ part of one of the
appeals. V . A I

“I feel that if someone cheats
in an election, it is not fair to
everyone that runs in the elec-
tion,” Auerbach said. .

According to the SGB
Elections Code, the only

recourse for students who wish
to appeal an Elections’ commit-
tee verdict is to file an appeal
with the Judicial Committee,
which handles disputes within
the SGB .

According to SGBJC chair Jim

Dockey,‘ students are permitted
to appeal elections committee
decisions within 48.hours of the

hearing, a procedure followed

by Auerbach.

“It is then [The judicial com-
mitteefsl job to determine if any
appeals are valid,” Dockey said.

According to the SGB
Elections Code, the judicial
committee has two options, to
either dismiss the appeal or to
send it back to the elections
committee for further review if
it is determined that procedural
errors have been committed.

But SGB advisor Joyce
Giangarlo said due to the cur-
rent structure of the appeals
process, the judicial committee
cannot increase the severity of
the ‘sanctions.

“The lack of a precedent in a
case like this . . . will make it
difficult to handle,” Giangarlo
said. '

Auerbach would not specu-
late on what she would consid-

er a fair outcome of the SGBJC’s
review, but said she realizes
they have limited options.

“I guess the judicial commit-
tee and elections committee will
make a decision [on the
appeal],” Auerbach said.“But
according to the [SGB code]
bylaws, they can't impose a

‘harsher penalty. We justwant to

make a statement that we feel
the election wasn’t handled fair-
ly.”

According to Gianga_rlo,the
SGBJC will review the appeals
in private this week and render
their verdict. ,

At the Nov. 18 hearing,
Pasquale was found guilty of
actively campaigning within 100
feet of the Sutherland Hall
polling booths on election day,
Nov. 17.

In light of this elections code

violation, The SGB Elections’.

Committee removed Pasquale’s
76 votes from'Sutherland Hall
and required a public apology

from Pasquale.

Even with the loss of the
votes, Pasquale defeated the
second highest finisher "by 60
votes. . ’
Last week Pasquale said he
didn’t believe his moral charac-
ter was in question because he
made a mistake: “...I was
warned once and complied
with my warning,” he said.

“I still find it peculiar that I
was the only candidate charged
with this Violation considering
successful and unsuccessful
candidates were also violating
this and other articles of the

code,” Pasquale said.

Auerbach and Gail Enright,
poll workers at the Sutherland
Hall, expressed dissatisfaction
with Pasquale’s sentence at the
next day’s SGB meeting.
Auerbach said she did not agree
with the way in which the situa-
tion was handled or the election
committee’s verdict.

She also commented that it

Ounce of prevention to
aid school-aged children
involved in athletics

Byjennifer Vernet
Staff Writer

An ounce of prevention is
worth a pound of cure.

Old cliche? Maybe so, but that
wasithe focus of a seminar at
Scaife Hall Nov. 20.

The day—long seminar,’ “The
Prevention and Management of
Sports Related Injuries in
School-Aged Children,” was

“geared towards parents, coach-

es, athletic trainers and other
professionals involved in physi-
cal therapy and sports inedi-
cine.

Larry Grollman, associate
director of Pitt’s Center for
Sports Medicine, said more than
half of all injuries in school-
aged children are sports related.

“We are striving for greater
awareness of the number and
severity of youth sports injuries
and the need for follow—up of
these injuries in an effort to
improve the overall health care
of young student athletes in
Pennsylvania,” he said.

A study by the National
Athletic Trainers Association
showed that 37 percent’ of all
high school football players sus-
tain injuries, and 61 percent of
those injuries occur at practice.

Grollman said the best way to
prevent injuries is to begin with
a thorough medical history of
each athlete. “Medical histories
are the most important compo-
nent of medical assessments,”
he said. “But, you can’t stop at
the student. You need to look at
the family’s medical history,

too. In cases of sudden death,
you have an athlete, who never
shows any physical symptoms,
and then suddenly drops dead.
Later, you find out he had a rel-
ative who [also] never had any
symptoms and dropped dead.”
Currently, the Pennsylvania
Intermediate Athletic Associa-
tion guidelines require a poten-
tial athlete to receive an exami-
nation or're-examination by a
physician, physician’s assistant
or nurse practitioner prior to
participation in each sport.
However, the PIAA (health
examination) card, which the
athlete must have completed by
a medical professional, only
requires a signature and a check
for scoliosis (curvature of the
spine). There are no specific
requirements for the examina-
tion. “We want to create stan-
dard guidelines for school dis-
tricts so that the coaches are
aware of the medical history for
each athlete and can act appro-

p priately if necessary.”

Linda Platt, a certified athletic
trainer and Pennsylvania
Athletic Trainers Society liaison
to the Special Olympics, said
there have been cases where
students were not eligible to
play sports for medical reasons,
and the problems were not
noticed by the physician.

“We need to go beyond
basic CPR and first aid,” Pl§'tt
said. 0

The seminar was co-spon-
sored by the Pennsylvania
Congress of Parents and
T eachers, Inc., and PAT S.

In January, Jack Matthews

$53,000.

He paid $20 a month in

and considering the interest
that has accumulated with his

to $30,000 in profit.

But before all students rush
to the next meeting with a
wad of cash in hand, they
should know that the Stock of
the.Month Club is limited to
employees of the University
of Pittsburgh. In existence
since 1962, the club had 52
members as of October.

According to Reuben

nomics at Pitt, one reason
why the club does so well in
comparison to other invest-
ment clubs‘ is that it doesn’t

payments, he will gain close.

'=Clubs, “which tells its mem-

bers what stocks to invest in.”
Slesinger said that with the
Stock of the Month Club,
members decide for them-
selves which stocks are the
best for investment.

Members of the club pay
between $10 and $20 a month
for investment in a portfolio;
examples of a few stocks in a
particular portfolio are AT&T,
Carnival Cruise, General Mills
and Heinz.

A five percent charge is
paid by the member for with-
drawing from the club.
“Normally we average about
four withdrawals per year,”
said Slesinger.

The club, as a whole, does
not file income taxes, but the
individual members must do
so.

Meeting on the s‘ first
Wednesday of every month,
the club members are issued
a copy of the club’s.finan-
cial report, which “states
the cost and value of each

share and documents the
percentage increase
or decrease over the past
month. The group must then
discuss and vote on whether
to drop, add or keep a current
stock.

The Interest Committee,
made up of three alternating
members, does seek some

advice from stock brokers and

does research on the current
conditions of stocks in the
market, but it is ultimately the
members of the club who
decide which stocks will be
bought or sold.

Slesinger, one of only three
members who have been in
the club since its existence,
said that “when the club was
only two-and—a-half years old,
a Pitt administrator reviewing
the Stock of the Month Club
commented that if the
University had invested its
trust fund intolthe club, the
school probably wouldn’t
have been in debt at the
time.”

The Marine Corps Toys for
Tots program has been in
effect for -46 years. It isbased
on the premise that “every

School of

Drop—off locations for

child deserves a little
Christmas.”

The idea was conceived in J
1947 by Maj. William J
Hendricks, Col. Charles
Shepard and Maj. John
Hampton. Toys for Tots
started out as a local event
to aid the orphaned children
of World War II.

The Toys for Tots founda-
tion earned several Guinness
Book of World Records
entries in 1990 for participa-
tion and donations received
from a home—call contest.

Today, the Marine Toys
for Tots program is conduct-
ed in nearly 200 cities
nationwide. The organiza-
tion collects or purchases
approximately eight million
toys annually. More than 3.5
million needy children are
provided with toys each
year, and it is estimated that
more than 100 million chil-
dren have been helped
throughout the years.

According to Holaren, the

for an education, but the back-
bone of all sororities is commu-
nity service.”

Kelly Reddy, the incoming
president, plans to continue
being involved with community
services throughout her term as
president.

Reddy said a lot of the sorority
members volunteer on their
own. “We have 800 women
who are able—bodied, and who
can give to others. It’s important
to help out the community and
‘our society, and as long as we
can do something we will.”

Reddy said she sees the
Panhellenic Association as a
governance group first. “We
govern the 12 sororities. Ii
someone comes to us with a

. problem, we ideally will have

the answers, or at least we can
point them to someone who
does.” I
According to Hayley Soffer,
president of Alpha Epsilon Phi,
a smoother rush is expected
from the new board members.
“Rush this year was smooth, but
it can always be smoother.”

In the future, Reddy said she is
planning a career seminar for
the sororities to give them
access to potential jobs and
connections within their field.
“The Panhellenic [Association]
is here to build unity for the
sororities; we all have a sense ol
bond by just being together,"

A Reddy said.

all the girls elected are well
qualified. We have all the confi-
dencein the world in them, and
were expecting them to do

plantation, patients from all
over the nation and abroad
come to Pittsburgh for trans-
plantation.

Because PUH is limited to
local distribution for priority
organs, there is a greater
shortage of organs due to the
large number of patients.
These_visitors also make it
more difficult for a local citi-
zen like, Steve Rzeczkowski,
a five-organ transplant suc-
cess story, to get a transplant
because once a patient
locates in Pittsburgh, they go
on the Pittsburgh list.

Even if the transplant is an
elective surgery, that patient
within the region where the
organ was donated gets first
crack at it, while a status four
patient at Presbyterian
University Hospital may die

~ waiting within PUH’s region.

“The system serves trans-
plant centers when it should
be serving patients,” said
UPMC spokesperson Lisa
Rossi. She disagrees with
Newman, believing distribu-
tion is viable. “A liver can sur-
vive between 18 and 24
hours before transplantation,”
she said. Kidneys also have
around a 24-hour indepen-
dent life span. .

Under UNOS policy, the
properties of individual
organs and their transporta-
bility aren’t considered when
debating policy on organ
sharing between regions.

Policy applies to organs in
general, but, policies within

Since transportability dif-
fers from organ to organ, sup-
porters of a national list feel
there should be separate cri-
teria for each organ regarding
distribution.

Legislation originally pro-
posed by former Senator Al
Gore’ called for a single
nationwide list. Supporters of
his plan, which include I
UPMC, said they believe it

could cut down on the differ-
ence in waiting times that‘
exist between transplant cen-
ters. Currently, the time a
patient waits varies from one
month to almost six years
between centers.

UNOS is developing a
computer program to simu-
late the effects of regional
versus national distribution
so they can measure the pos-
sible effects of both methods,
according to Newman.

Under the UNOS system,
money which is already limit-
ed for the care of these criti-

liver transplant rose by
$148,000 in 1992.

Because patients are wait-
ing longer for a donor, the
length of time spent in a criti-
cal care unit increases, and so
does cost. UPMC trans-
plant surgeon Dr. Andreas
Tzakis testified before a con-
gressional subcommittee that
the average length of stay for
transplant patients rose from
46.8 days in 1991 to 58 in
1992.

The subcommittee, which
was examining the problems
with the distribution system,
was also informed that the
average bill rose from
$434,000 to $582,000 due to
the extended stays.

' Unfortunately for UNOS, it

centers. They have no voice
in determining how many
facilities should exist.

“Other than inspecting the
facilities, and giving accredi-
tation, we don’t handle any
other decisions on who’s out
there,” said Newman. .

According to the Clinton
health care plan, which is
vague on the subject, the
number of transplant facilities
would be “streamlined.”
Newman said if that happens,
the UNOS allocation policies
would move toward national
distribution.

Not in our hachyara’

Canadians were caught smuggling an American good
across the U.S.—Canadian border on Sunday. And no,
they weren’t just trying to get cheaper cigarettes.

The item that was of such value that it compelled
Canadians to leave their homeland is also the same
good that was so dangerous that customs officers
enforced a seizure order at border points. This item
was a newspaper. " ‘ .

The papers were smuggled so that Canadians could
_“find out what really happened last summer in a lurid
sex—murder trial conducted in a Canadian courtroom,”
according to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.

According to the Post-Gazette, a judicial gag order
has been placed on the Canadian media. to ensure that

‘Paul Teale, who faces two or threemurder charges .

and at least 43 rape charges, receivesja fair trial. 
gag order was originally enforced 7_(l_iuringV' the trial of
Karla Homolka, Teale’s wife, frornjwhic’h,U.S. reporters
were banned because the judge ‘knew--fhe couldn’t
enforce the order outside of Canada. 4'   ’ 

E However, two major U.S. newspaper§{§fC§;The Sunafay
Detroit News-and Free» Press  News,

censored their Canadian editions to abide by the cdiirt
order, even though it runs counter to U.S. principles of
press freedom, the Post-Gazette reported.

. Freedom of speech is not just a principle — it’s a

-fi‘int. Censoi-‘§h'ifJ.i...

jl>ick_and_,..c_hoo§e.,_ what the ﬁmedia ca _ _ __ _
‘leaves peopleuninformed; and that is truly dangefousi“
Even though this gag order could not be enforced in
the United States, two major papers complied with it.
These papers are sending a message which says.cen-
sorship is,Qkay_. ,\_X7_e can only wonder what other pleas
of c'e':r’1‘s1c'>‘1'\s.‘11‘lphtll1'<'3' '53j5‘é'r's have abided by. I l

U.S. citizens trying to enter Canada could have also
been affected by this order, as customs officials were
seizing these newspaper from everyone, notjust
Canadians, according to the Post-Gazette.

  

; Not only was the media censored, but with the A

seizure of the newspapers, Canadian citizens were
basically told what they were allowed to read. It’s hard
to imagine that we would passively accept this kind of
government control, but that’s exactly what The
Sunday Detroit News and Free Press and The Buﬂalo
News did. ,

lAccording to The Post-Gazette, news organizations
are fighting the ban in court, but no one has defied
the ban. We hope that the Courts rule in favor of the

’ media and set a precedent which will stop the

Canadian government from further censorship.

We only hope that if this situation should happen
here, that other U.S. newspapers will not be as compli-
ant as The Sunday Detroit News and Free Press and
The Buffalo News have been towards Canadian offi-

‘cials.

Strong coaching keys volleyba success

First of a two—part
series on the history
of Panther Volleyball

By Ryan Buncher
Senior Staff Writer

In the late ‘70s, Mike Hebert worked part
time as Pitt volleyball’s head coach. He had
to sweep the gym, put up the nets, produce
the programs and hire the officials for his
team’s matches. The Panthers played in
Trees Hall — at best adequate as a practice
facility now.

“You should have seen it then,” Hebert ‘

said. “It was a war zone.”

The conditions for Pitt volleyball have
changed with the times. Current head coach
Cindy Braziel is a full-timer. The Panthers
raised their number of scholarships to the
legal limit of 12 this season. The matches
have moved from the “war zone” to
Fitzgerald Field House.

Hebert was the beginning of a tradition of

strong coaching that has made Pitt a consis- -
tent winning team, a program that is mak— _

ing a move up with improved recruiting..

“Mike Hebert built the program from
scratch to a nationally competitive pro-
gram,” Shelton Collier, who replaced
Hebert in 1980, said. “He did that by teach-
ing a high level of volleyball. In the late
‘70s, the University of Pittsburgh was able
to compete with many of the top teams in
the country. That was probably the most
important part of the foundation of the pro-
gram.” ‘

Panther volleyball began in 1974 when
Pitt added eight women’s teams to its athlet-
ic department in compliance with the newly
passed title IX. They are the eight teams the
program has now. They‘ competed in the
Association of Intercollegiate Athletics for
Women (AIAW)

According to Senior Associate Athletic
Director Carol Sprague, Pitt spent $5,500 on
scholarships for its first volleyball recruits,
and five of them were combined volley-
ball/basketball scholarships. Local high
school coaches took over the teams part
time.

Sprague took over the women’s swim-
ming, program while Mary Kromer stepped
in for the volleyball team.

With a recruiting base of almost all local
players, Pitt was able to win, combining for
a 32-6 record in two years, under Kromer.
Hebert said there were decent teams at the
time, but not near the level of competition
of today.

“They were good, hard—nosed kids that

wouldn’t quit,” Sprague said. “In all of my
years of watching Pitt women’s volleyball
 I’ve never seen a Pitt team quit. I believe
that started with the work ethic of those ini-
tial k'.ids. Nobody could tell them they
weren’t good enough.” ' _
Hebert, who was teaching at Mt. Lebanon
High School, was hired as a part—time coach
in 1976, with Rich Shall of Derry Area High

Confusion. A very good
word to describe the state of
college football these days. '

The regular season has just’
come to a tumultuous halt and
the race for the national title is
as cloudy as ever. The so-
called bowl coalition was sup-
posed to put an end to any
controversy surrounding the

' national championship. The

No. 1 vs. No. 2 game which
the bowl coalition mandates is
designed to solve all problems.

Guess what? It doesn’t,

J hasn’t, and won’t work. If any- q
thing, _it's_,made things more ,-

confusing. . A

Pitt basketball tops latest Beck

McCullough's return, Marathon's muscle, and
Maryland's upset among the topics of choice

Before one foot steps on the
bandwagon to chastise the Pitt

men’s hoop team losses in exhi-4

bition play earlier this month,
take into account a couple of
facts:

1) Pitt essentially played both
exhibition games without a true
point guard. McCullough sat at
the end of the Pitt bench against
the Canadian National team and
played with strep throat versus
Marathon Oil.

2) Marathon Oil sports three
separate teams that tour the
country’s top colleges. The No.
1 squad that beat Pitt rolled
undefeated through the Big East
so Pitt isn’t exactly alone. And
as for the loss to the Canadian
National team, so what.
Kentucky lost in Rupp Arena to

that vaunted powerhouse the
Australian National team. Does
that mean Kentucky is doomed
to an NCAA—less season? Ahh 
no.

  Wrestling takes tloim’ place

at Lock Haven Invitational
Catalano nabs loneﬁrst in Pitt's '93-94 opener

Dan Lauso
Staff Writer

The 1995-94 Pitt Panthers
wrestling team opened its sea-
son with an impressive third
place finish at the Lock Haven
Invitational this past Saturday.

The Lock Haven Invitational
Tournament matches wrestlers
from some of the top—rated pro-
grams — including Pitt’s — in
the country.

Out of the 13-team field, Pitt
finished behind only the cream
of the country’s wrestling crop.
Finishing third to the top-five
ranked teams of Oklahoma
State, (which won) and Penn
State, (which finished second)
gives the Panthers a good start

. toward reaching their team goal

of finishing the season in the
top 15.

At Lock Haven, the Panthers
competed in a grueling one—day
competition.

“The quality of competition is
fantastic for a one-day tourna-
ment,” said assistant head coach
Jim Beichner. 1

Rich Catalano, wrestling out
of the 167—pound division, went
all the way in his weight classifi-
cation to win his division and
lead the Panthers’ wr_estling
attack.

The Panthers’ big guns, Jeff
Kloiber and Pat Wiltanger, were
a little slow in getting started in
their first taste of competition
this year. ,

Kloiber, who is ranked third
in the country wrestling out of
the 190-pound classification,
finished a disappointing third in
his division. Kloiber, who was
seated first in the 190-pound
class, fell behind early in the
semi-final match 6-0.

Heavyweight Pat Wiltanger
wrestled to a fifth—place finish in

the battle of the big men.

A little disappointment in the
opening matches of the season
could translate into a good
learning experience for the
Panthers’ top wrestlers. _

First-year wrestler John
Withrow was a pleasant surprise
at 158 pounds for the team up
at Lock Haven. Withrow fought
off any butterﬂies he was feel-

ing and wrestled to an impres-

sive sixth—place finish in first
ever collegiate event.

1 The 142—pound division saw
Brett Gould finish in the fifth
position of his weight class.

Eric Yanek wrestled to a
sixth-place finish in the 150-
pound weight division.

The Panther grappler who
had the toughest afternoon was
134—pound. specialist. John
Richey. Richey was forced to
forfeit his match clue to injury
default. Richey sustained an
injury earlier in the day when
he caught an opponent’s elbow
on his nose.

“We wanted to finish in the
top three or four,” said

-Beichner. “Third [place] was a
good finish for us.”

The Panthers grapplers have
eased up on their rigorous prac-
tice schedule in order to rest up
the

Invitational they will be com-
peting in thisweekend.

The Las Vegas Invitational is
almost a mini—NCAA tourna-
ment with many of the top-50
teams in the country competing
for the top honors.

The Panthers are gambling on
having a good tournament this
weekend to see how they
match up against the best
wrestlers this country has to
offer.

“This is a good chance to see
how. -we match up against the
rest of the country,” Beichner
said.

The wrestling team is hoping
to finish somewhere in the top
15 in Las Vegas this weekend.
This weekend should be a good
barometer on how good this tal-
ented wrestling team can be
over the course of this year's
wrestling season.

On the whole the Panthers
seem ready for another success-
ful wrestling season.

“We’re ahead of last year’s
team and in better condition.
Technique-wise we’re on
schedule to meet our goals,”
Beichner said.

The Panthers embark on their
huge weekend this Thursday
afternoon and will return home
on Sunday. 1

School as his assistant.

“We found that we had a
good team,” Hebert said.
“We went to the semifinals in
the region [that yearl.”

Pitt placed fourth in the
Eastern region of the AIAW
(EAIAW) in ‘76 and ‘77.

Hebert pushed for the cre-
ation of a men’s team so he
could take it over and be a
coach full time. He got his
wish in 1978.

Pitt won the next two
straight EAIAW champi-
onships. In those seasons,
Pitt had the highest national
ranking in its history, rating
ninth in the AIAW.

“We were considered the
first team in the East that
could play on that level,”
Hebert said. “Pitt looked
legitimate and was competi-
tive. Up until thatpoint, the
East was considered a joke.
We made a major statement
for Eastern volleyball.

“Before the early ‘80s,

there were teams that could
maintain national rankings
without the full commit-
merit.”

Hebert left to take a job at
New Mexico after the ‘79
season (he is now at Illinois).
With Hebert’s recommenda-
tion, Collier was brought in
as a replacement for the
women while Reilly took
over the now defunct men’s
team.

In 1982, the NCAA took
over women’s volleyball. Pitt
was in‘ a position to domi-
nate the Big East conference.

“When volleyball
[became] an NCAA qualifying
sport, the University of
Pittsburgh was ready to go,”
Collier said. “Many of the
other Big East teams were
way behind in terms of
scholarships and the commit-
ment to coaching. At that
point, Pittsburgh was in a
good position to capitalize
on it by winning the Big East

and participating in NCAA
tournaments.”

Pitt won four of the first

seven Big East tournaments
before Collier left in 1988.
Those wins brought automatic
NCAA tournament bids. _

“That was a key-  to be
able to go into homes and say
if we win the Big East touma-
ment, we’re going to the NCAA
tournament,” Sprague said.
“That was a wonderful recruit-
ing tool.”

.One thing Pitt was not able
to do was keep up with the
emerging powerhouse pro-
grams in women’s volleyball
— teams‘ with stronger com-
mitments to their volleyball
programs.

“[Before ‘82] It didn’t matter
if a school had millions of dol-
lars it wanted to spend, they
weren’t allowed to spend it,”
Sprague said. “It helped keep

the playing ﬁeld level. In 1982,

women were in the NCAA and
all bets were off.

“Some schools made the
We did not
[make the coinmitmentl to the
level of the schools in the top

‘ 20 nowgdjd.-£We’ve been in and

out of the top 725.‘ It’s a"credit

to tlie"coa‘cli'es§ and the kids in "

our program because in many
cases, they weren’t on a level
playing field with other
teams.” '

Hebert agreed that teams in
the top conferences, such as
the Pac 10 and Big 10, pulled
away from the rest of the
nation at this time.

The Big East provided the
automatic bid, but staying atop
the conference was not
enough to stay at the top
nationally.

“The NCAA is very confer.-
ence—oriented,” Collier said. “If
Pittsburgh had the top
resources in the Big East, I feel
as if the Big East should make
the first moves. We would go
into the administrative and
coaches meetings and tell
them that it was difficult for
Pitt to keep pace nationally if
the Big East "coaches and
administrations weren’t even
wanting to compete within the
Big East.” ‘

Collier, now the coach at-
Georgia Tech, got an offer to
move on to the U.S. national
team. He helped in the search
for a new coach.

Since Hebert came in 1976,
every Pitt coachthat has left
moved up.

Each helped bring in a
replacement.

Sprague said Pitt has been

'l,u,(ckyl’with its Volleyball coach-
‘es, and counted it among the
areas that she said are the keys

to a successful program.
“You’ve got to have the best
coach you can afford,”

Sprague said. “You’ve got to

give them the maximum num-

ber of scholarships. You’ve got
to give them the money to
recruit. Those things have to
come before you get uniforms
or shoes every year.

“What kids respect is talent.
They want to play with the
best and against the best.”

The result of the search for
Collier’s replacement was the
hiring of 1984 Olympic silver
medalist (and former Southern
Cal star and assistant coach)
Sue Woodstra. Woodstra had
been a setter for two Olympic
teams, including the one that
boycotted the 1980 Olympic
games.

“Clearly, bringing
[Woodstra] here was a sign that
Pittsburgh was committed to
build its volleyball program to
a top 20 level,” Spraguelsaid.
“She helped the perception of
the program. There were kids
who wanted to play for some-
body like Sue Woodstra.”

Collier left behind what he
called “One of the best young
teams in the country?’

That team included juniors
Michele Adainson (all-confer-
ence in 1990) and setter
Jenelle Lantagne (Big East
Player of the Year in 1990)..
The sophomore class of Sue
Zonneville, Dee MacAulay,
Linda Zols, ‘Heather Hollands,
Bridget Gary and Shelly Seanor

won Big East championships
each of the four seasons they
were at Pitt.

That team and Panther teams
since were built on recruiting
outside-~the region. For exam-
ple, Adamson, MacAulay' and
Hollands came from Canada
and Lantagne is a native of San
Diego, Calif..

“Volleyball in this region is
not great, so we have to go out
of the region to get the majori-
ty of our kids,” Braziel said.
“We can get maybe one a year
from Pennsylvania.” ‘

Collier was also in the
process of recruiting a high
school classmate L of
MacAulay’s who had gone on
to the Canadian Junior national
team. Woodstra took over in
the middle of the recruiting
season, and picked up the
effort;

“I told her, ‘You need to sign
this girl. She’s one of the best
players I’ve ever seen.”’

Without watching Ann Marie
Lucanie play, Woodstra fol-

lowed Collier’s advice and‘

Lucanie joined the Panthers for
the 1990 season. .

“That is an example of how
one coach leaving the program
was able to help the other
coach coming in, and the pro-
gram didn’t miss a beat,”
Collier said. “As a matter of
fact, it made even more
progress.”

- . . . u 0

THE PI'IT NEWS, Tuesdax, November §o, 122;

The coaching change in
recruiting time did not hurt Pitt
in this case, in large part
because of the recruiting draw
that Woodstra was.

“lWoodstia being at Pitt] was
a major factor,” Lucanie said.
“It was that  and there were
so many other Canadians here.
It was [also] only five hours
from home [Don Mills,
Ontario].”

Adamson, MacAulay and
Hollands were all from
Canada, and Lucanie had spo-
ken to all of them about Pitt.

“I’m not going to come to a
program that I think sticks,”
Lucanie said. “Having Sue as a
coach was a bonus.”

Lucanie‘ was the final piece
in one of the best teams Pitt
has had. The Panthers rolled to
a 32-6 record and knocked off
Ohio State in Columbus forthe
first NCAA tournament victory
in team history. Lucanie
missed about a month with an
ankle injury,1 but was named
-Big East rookie of the year and
MVP of the conference tourna-
ment.

“My freshman year was
incredible,” Lucanie said. “Our
first tournament  we took
[top-rankedl UCLA to five
games, we beat Wisconsin [a
top 20 team] and Duke. That
was- incredible, then we beat
Ohio State [in the tourna-
mentl.” - '
