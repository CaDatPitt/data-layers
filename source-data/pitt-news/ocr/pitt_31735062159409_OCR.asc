Spring Kits

In Mail--
Batehelder

Preparations _are already under-
way-for pre-registration for spring

classes, according to E.A. Batch-
elder, assi_stant registrar.

The registration kits are being
mailed out this week to graduate
students, non-degree students, eve-
ning students, and all undergradu-
ates except sophomores, juniors,
‘and seniors of the School of Engi-
neering and Mines‘. The 15,000 kits
are being mailed early to avoid the
Christmas mail rush.

The kits will be sent to the stu-
dent's home address. Since the kits
are being sent as third class mail,
they will not be forwarded.

Address Changes Needed

If a student has moved without
notifying the registrar’s office, he
will not receive his kit. If kits are
not received by the end of the
Christmas vacation students should
go to the registrar’s'“office on the
18th floor to get one. '

The week of Jan. 9 to 14 will be
pre-registration week. Prior to that
date students should fillin the stu-
dy list and cards.

On Jan. 9 and 10 teachers of con-
tinuation courses will pass out
'-class cards during class periods.

" Other cards will be given out Jan.
 _12 and 13 in the departmental of-g

fices".
To avoid‘ excessive use of ele-

,,.t..vators, the following departments

will' have representatives in the
Commons Room: biological sciences
economics, Er1glish,‘hist0ry, indus-
\try, political science, psychology,
and. sociology.
— Each class card must be filled
in andplacedin the pre-registriation
kit with the completed forms.

Registrar Gets Kits

As soon as possible during the
period Jan. 9 to 14 thepre-regis-
tration envelope and study list
should be taken to the registrar’s
station in the Commons Room. In
exchange for the envelope the stu-
dent will be given a registration
appointment card.

Final registration will be held
Feb. 8 to 11 at the hour designated
on the appointment card in Syria

.Mosque. At that time, if there are
no changes in schedule since pre-
registration, all the student need
do is pick up his cards, have his
ID card stamped, and pay the cashier.

Students who expect to graduate
this June should make application
at final registration.

This year-’s final registration will
last 31,,/, days in place of last year's
433 days.

' Festival Amusement Success,

W.inds Up Financial Flop  

Although the 1949 Spring Festival was generally hailed as
the best since the celebrations were began, it ended in the red.
According‘ to the financial report submitted by Jim Madden,

’49 Festival business manager, the
total income of $6,988.20 subtracted
from expenses which amounted to
$7,102_55 left a total loss of
$114.35.

The program can be broken down
into eight divisions: the main oall,
tea dance, carnival, music festival,
tap day, float parade, publicity,
and general items.

The report shows that the fig-
ures for the float parade and pub-
licity fall entirely in the expenses
and loss columns. With expenses
0f$l93.‘93 and $238.46 respectively,
and no income, these two items
alone showed a deficit of 3543239.

Losses in seven of the eight divi-
sions amounted to $1,866.39. The
eighth item, the carnival, made a

..pr,ofit, of $i,7s2,o4. The income_

in any danger.

About the only lasting effect of
the incident is the fact that a form-
erly unpaved portion of the base-
ment floor is now coated with an
even layer of vagrant cement.

The Gym was taken over by the
Veterans Administration last year.
As yet they have not announced any‘
definite plans as to the disposition,
ofthe hilltop building.

Built from a grant by Joseph
Benedum Trees, it was a new
building about the time that the
Thaw and State Halls were new.
At the time its 700 seating capa-
city and hardwood floors made it
one of the most modern gyms in the
country.

Trees Gym will eventually be
supplanted by a modern sports
pavilion included in the new build-
ing program. Until then gym stu-
dents will perform in the“ partially
repaved Gym. '

New Panther
’ Thinks His Job
Is Cat ’s Meow

Andy Schurman, who thought
the Pitt Panther was. the cat’s
meow as a five year old kid, is
now the cat’s whiskers,himself.

Schurman, a College junior,
has been named by Ben Grady,
swimming coach and adviser for
the demonstration bloc, to suc-
ceed Dario (Ike) lcardi, graduat-
ing senior, as the Pitt Panther,
next fall.

Andy’s education for the mas-
querade began
early. He says
he has. been
bucking for the
job since, asa
five-year old
spectator at his
first Pitt foot-
ball game, he
was thrilled by
the Panther’s
icantics.

“I think the Panther should be
the Stadium Lunatic,” asserts
Andy. He promises to skin the
cat with “lots of shenanigans.”

According to Andy, he gOC the
job after casually asking swim-
ming coach Grady one day this
fall.

The man in the panther skin
will hol§ the clowning glory on
condition that the student de-
monstration block, which healso
directs, continues its activities.

3 Bands Highlight IF Ball Tonight

Interfraternity Council will try
‘something new at its Winter Wander-
land Ball tonight at the;Hotel Wil-

bands and three ballrooms.

With jack Fina serenading from
the Urban Rwm, Johnny Long in
the Main Ballroom, Wes Parker in
the Fort Duquesne Room, and re-
freshménts in the Fort Pitt Room,
the IF Formal will occupy‘ the en-
tire 17th floor of the William Penn
Hotel from 9 p.m. until 1 a.m.

Fina, recently at Bill Green's,
follows in the footsteps of his for-
mer employer Freddy Martin by pre-
senting fine dance arrangements of

 

the classics. Long comes in from
Allentown to cater, for the most
part, to modern jazz and bop fans.

Parker, who‘ fronts a local outfit
that has played for many University
dances, has recently ended an en-
gagement at the Vogue Terrace.

Dave Cleland, IF Social Commit-
tee Chairman, announces that the
practice of choosing an IF Sweet-
heart during intermission will be
discontinued.

In its place, the intermission pro-

P rwate, Keep Out -
I During the past season efforts were made in many quartersto
encourage student support of the football team. A degree of suc-
cess was attained in this direction. But when the time lcameto
-capitalize on it--as a banquet most’ certainly‘ does, the Varsity
,. Lettermen’s Club, which sponsors the annual affair, put on pretty
I much of a private party.
_ The students, whose support was being cultivated during the
season, were conspicuous by their absence. Why? Practically no
effort was made by the hosts to extend an open invitation to ‘the
student body, urging them to come if they cared to invest in a
l $5 ticket. ‘All that appeared in public print were brief stories on
Wt‘hii"affair. in the downtown dailies, which mentioned that the ban-
q et was open to the public. Even there, students weren’t men-
tio] ‘ed specifically. The News received-no notification of the
dinner and was not invited to send a representative to report the
gs-on to the students. ‘
Small wonder Pitt’s alumni organizations are weak in com-
“arisen to those of other schools. They ignore the student until
e is eligibIe for membership and tapping for funds. It’s reason-
e to assume that they would build a stronger organization if.
. began to court prospective members earlier rather than prac-
yesnub thg undergraduates as they do now at times.
‘he? "uninvited” students weren’t the only ones missing at
eel, Schenley last week. Quite a few of the athletes being feted

9even bother to.attend.and another handful left as soon as
I‘ new ran out. Rather rude guests. -
Our concern’ here is not so much with the Lettermen’s failure
to-Aerrcourage student attendance at the banquet. iaybe it was
aimed, as one person indicated, as more of a get-together for the
athletic alumni than a dinner for the gridders and runners.
We feel that the banquet ought to be given back to the stu-
dents. They tell us (we weren’t around here then to see it) that
the best football banquet ever put on at Pitt was held in 1940. ‘It
was served in the Commons Room with the University footing the
, bill. Some 500 students of a total enrollment of less than 5000
were *on_ hand to toast the gridders of that season, when Pitt’s
long-standing football glitter was beginning to~tarn~ish. That
affair, had, they say, the full enthusiasm of students applauding
the achievements of their classmates and as fine a program as
’ has ever been arranged. I j
Compare that with the most recent football banquets and see
why the boat is being missed. -
i This successful banquet of a decade ago was promotedby the
student government organization, with the backing coming from
athletic funds. The promotion was leveled first at the students,
then at the alumni. _ l
The war, apparently, knocked out this scheme of things. When
revivalwas in order, it was the Lettermen who did the restoring.
They deserve credit for that. Maybe they'd be happy to see the
students take it over, or, at least, arrange for a setup that would
i get the students properly into the act.

Letters to the Editor

Clttims Paradox

Editor,
Pitt News

‘The University of Pittsburgh is
sittingright smack in the middle
of Higher Education’s biggest,
silliest paradox.

In every university in the coun-
try, the schools of education are;
stressing the importance to pot-
ential teachers of‘other factors
than mere knowledge of their sub-
ject., They drill on: Educational
Psychology, Teaching Methods,
Organization, Presentation, Visual
Aids, etc.; yet, in choosing their
own instructors, they completely
disregard qualifications along
these lines. ‘

College professors are almost
tradionally chosen for their ability
in a particular field, with perfect
disregard for their teaching quali-
fications. Many of them know their
subject very well, but cannot ex-A
press themselves clearly or simply
enough for the student to under-
stand. Many are extremely illogical
and inconsistent in their presenta-
tion. Their tests are too difficult,
or too simple; sometimes they do
not even cover theisubject being
studied. _

One example is that of an Econ-
omics professor who lectured on
material outside the book, gave
very technically-worded tests on
book material, and still didn’t keep
up with the schedule set by the
department head. Nevertheless, the
students were expected to. take
andpass the Departmental Exams
with the same case (and percent-
ages) as those who had received
adequate instruction. To a stu-
dent who really wants to learn,
this is demoralizing. It kills in-
terest in the subject and discour-
ages studying. .Indeed, in many
cases the poor student doesn’t
even know what to study.

,Certain departments in this Uni-
versity, e.g., Mathematics, Ac-
counting, will not allow a student
to keep the same instructor two

this policy by stating that the stu-
dent should, get experience in dif-
ferent viewpoints and ideas. The
probable reason for this is rather
that, if students were allowed to
choose their instructors, they would
all-want the same few teachers.
This does not necessarily mean
that those departments have, in
general, poorer teachers — but it’s

semesters in a row. They defend _

ured that I had seen the last of
my search for good teachers. I
supposed that in college, at least,
all the professors would be able
to present a subject clearly enough
for the average student to under-
stand it. I was disillusioned.

Maybe it is not possible ‘for a
college to pay high enough salaries
to attract good teachers. Maybe
there is a good reason for this
pitiable situation. And then, possi-
bly, the deans feel that a person
learns more out of a course if he
has to fight for everything helearns.

I’m just an insignificant sopho-
more and I’ll frankly admit that
I’m still childish and immature in
many ways. But if several inci-
dents I've seen around Pitt are
typical of the "mature, educated"
college student, then I prefer to
remain as I am. It certainly rep-
resents the utmost of “maturity”
to get so stupidly drunk to throw a
-bottle and injure another person.
In consideration of undeniable
facts concerning liquor, it truly
takes ‘a “very well-educated” per-
son to literally pour such rot-gut
into the wonderful human body
God has given each of us. It, ln
order to become mature when com-
ing to college, one must learn to
drink and carouse, (if one doesn’t
already know how), then I’ll remain
childish and adolescent.

I agree Wlth the University in
that they should punish the offen-
der in the jug-throwing incident
when ‘he is caught. But the Uni-
versity also resembles the Pitts-
burgh Police Dep’_t. in that they
take action after harm is done.

In theory one is forbidden to
take alcoholic beverages into the
stadium. Now on a cold wintry day
it no doubt is quite possible to
conceal a bottle undera heavy over-
coat. But I challenge anyone : to
show me a coat heavy enough to
conceal a whole Case Of been I
saw far more than just one case of
beer at the last few football
games. A corps of guards or
watchers could easily roam through
the stands to catch people drink-
ing. What good is a rule that is not
enforced-

Two things could stop trouble at

games. The University could kick"

out those caught drinking, or‘ lift
their activity card, or something
like that. Secondly, the students
who drink like that ought to grow up.-

BY JOAN SCHEWE

The problem of what to do about
discrimination inside their organi-
zations was putrecently to the cam-
pus fraternities by theNational In-
terfraternity Conference in Wash-
ington. Since the issue is of inter-
est to fraternity and independent
men and women alike, the question,
"What do you think about discrimi-
nation in fraternities?” was asked
more than 20 students. Of these,
some refused to comment. Others
are quoted below.

Sherwin Wasserman, College "51,
Kappa Beta Phi: "I don’t think it’s
an especially good thing. There are

xmore important things to judge a

man by.”

Louise Totten, College ’50, Al-
pha Delta Pi: “It is an unfair and
illogical way to judge people.”

Frank Jakes, College "52, Theta
Chi (pledge): "I dcn’t think the dis-

crimination in frats is especially

strict. A certain amount of it is
usually advisable.”

Titica Xerocostas. College '52,
ind.ependent: "I am not in favor of
discrimination.”

Virgil ll. llightower, College ’S3,
Omega Psi Phi (pledge): "Like any
other field ofhuman relations where
racial discrimination exists, it
should be done away with. This
would be in keeping with out demo-
cratic way of life.”

George Factor, College ’50, inde-
pendent: “There should be nothing _
written in the constitutions or by-
laws. I recognize however the ten-
dency of certain groups to cling to-
gether, as far as race and religion '
are concerned. :

Sylvan Jacobson, Bus Ad ’53, Pi’
Lambda Phi: "I feel that there should
be a certain amount of discrimina-
tion so that harmony exists in a fra-
ternity. Selection should depend
upon similar ideals and thinking.”

Herbert Thomhill, College ’51,
independent: "University students
should be broadminded. All doors
should be open.”

Richard Matson, College ’S0, :
Delta ‘Tau Delta: “I don’t think dis-
crimination is practiced anymore in
fraternities thanin any other social
organization. Fraternities are only
reflecting the practices of society
and why should the frats be jumped
on. Anyone has his choice of what
group he wants to associate with.”

Marcia Swartz, College ’50.inde'"
pendent: “Selection should be on
the basis of individual worth and
individual comparability. The wo-

.men’s groups seem to be sadly be-
hind the men’s.”'

Lynn Flegal, College '52. inde‘
pendent: "What is meant by dis-
crimination? Every choise is based

on some discrimination.”

Bill Brueckman, College '50, Sig-
ma Alpha Epsilon: “If they want
to have fraternities without dis-
crimination let them start new ones.”

Dolores Morey, Education ’S2,

tices were removed, fraternity mem-

Student Congress took time off
from its legislative duties on Mon-
day to help celebrate the birthday
of Congressman Don Ewart.

Surprised by the unexpected
gesture, the publicity-conscious

Ewart was flustered as he walked
to‘ the'president’s table to blow
out the five candles and cut the
chocolate cake which
legislators had obtained.
When

candles,

his fellow

queried about the five
one nimble-witted Con-
gress member re-
plied jokingly,
"lt’s for his(Ew—
,aft’S) mental
' age.” He was 20
» on Wednesday.
While slices of
the cake were
0 ein g p a s s e d
around, Theodore
W. Biddle, dean
of men, entered
the room. Iie_re-
fused the prof-
fered pastry and turned the atten-
tion of the assembly back to leg-
islating.

Dean Biddle spoke of the dis-
position of money from the Student
Activity and Athletic Fund. The
question was brought to the atten-
tion of Congress last week by sec-
retary Cora Pancereve.

    

Don Ewart _

Miss Pancereve stated that six-
teen and two-thirds per cent of
each student’s yearly tuition is
diverted to the Fund and she asked
for an accounting of the appropri-
ation and disposition of the money.

Dean Biddle said that the money
from the SAAF is allotted after
hearings each spring with student
activity officers and directors. A
percentage is given to the athletic
and student activities’ directors
and the athletic office, he said.

“If we had student activity fees
the disposition of the money would
doubtless be subject to review by
a student board. Siiice the Univer-
sity receives state financial sup-
port, the state has a right to look
into all income and we can only
spend as approved by the state,”
Dean ‘3iddle told Congress.

nounced in the News of the Tues-
day before elections and at the
nominee’s dinner held that same
night. The next day women's elec-
tions are held.

Discussion of the traditional sys-
tem developed when some members
of the executive committee ques-
tioned whether one day was enough
time to produce intelligent voting
on the part of the women.

For the past few weeks members
of the executive committee have
been discussing the pros and cons
of retaining the’ prevailing system
of announcing elec_tion nominees.

The points brought out in favor
of keeping the old system are that
it is a tradition that in the past has
succeeded in keeping politics out
of women's elections. Such a me-
chod has also prodigced qualified
officers for all organizations, it is
«argued.

After summarizing its feelings
on the question,’the WSGA execu-
tive committee is prepared to pre-
sent the question to the Commis-
sion atemtheir monthly meeting next
Tuesday.

The executive committee, upon
receipt of the Commission’srecom-
mendation, will make a final deci-
sion. This decision will be followed
in the coming spring elections and
used as a recommendation for suc-
ceeding elections.

By SAM SPATTER

‘ What ‘knitting and bridge mean to most Pitt coeds, football and basket-
ball means to a 20-year-old Pitt junior, Ann “Che-Che” Sweadner.
For this young coed is one who excels in most sports. And that’swith

men’s rulesl_

Ann is a journalism major who
hails from Etna where most of her
athletic feats were accomplished.
In high school she was a forward
on the school’s girls’ basketball
team. This team playedindependent
ball under the name “Silouettoes”
and twice defeated all-male Shady
Side Academy, according to Ann.

IM Participant

While at California State Teachers
College in 1947, this amazing Pitt
coed was the only woman to play
intramural basketball in the men’s
circuit. She added to this distinction
by being the lone gal in a male
gym class.

Ann is not a one-sport person-
ality. She enjoys most sports, al-
though she admits football is No. l
on her sports parade.And this coed
is one who not only watches foot-
ball but also plays the rugged game.
Perhaps Coach Milligan could use
the five foot two inch gal to re-
place graduating Bill llardisty as
the Panther punter. Ann claims
she can boot a 50-yard punt.’

Mean Hitter

When the baseball season is in
full force, the Pitt junior, who
weighs ahealthy 135 pounds, can
be found playing the infield or
pitching for the Noble Heights
"Outlaws.” The "Outlaws”= are
are entered in the West Penn League
where Ann proved one of the lead-
ing batters of the loop by liittivig
at a .300 clip. l .
.Other sports also hold the in-
terest of Pitt’s super-sportswoman.
She is an acrobat and ,"ati_accom-
plished hand-walker; she" swims,
plays tennis, roller skates, and is
a rabid fisher and hunter. With her
"22” she is considered a "dead-
eye,” a fact many rabbits have
discovered. When Ann was attend-
ing California State she was elected
president of the Girls’ Rifle Club

at the school. .
“It was roller skating that brought
me to Pitt,” Ann says. “The ab-
sence of a rink out at California

This journalistic-minded Pitt
junior has a unique ambition"After
graduation, I’m heading for Canada
and the deep woods,” beamed Ann,
“where I can become a naturalist
and write about nature.’,’ .

Ann has not as yet received any
offers from professional scouts.
However-, there is still time for
them to "discover” her before she
heads for the deep woods of Can-
ada. Who knows, she may become
the first woman in big league base-

Wrestling Back After 11 Years

Coed Stars in Male Sports Pitt Opens H‘”'e Sa‘“’day L

Against Gettysburg Malmenf

By JOHN MEGELLA -

After a decade of absence, Pitt returns to college wrestling}
wars tomorrow at 2 p.m. when the Blue and Gold grapplers host -
Gettysburg in the season opener at the Stadium Pavilion.

Termed the. ultimate in character
building -- one of the PUPPOSCS of
college athletics - Pitt Coach Rex
Peery, wrestling appears on the
Pitt sports scene as part of a re-
cently expanded athletic program.

Sport ‘Escapes’

With the first match, wrestling,
which hasn't been a part of the
University athletic program for 11
years, will escape the slow death
administrators had destined it for.

Grady’s Tankers Get Break;
Trees Pool Doors Locked

The only ones who haven’t been
inconvenienced by the water and gas

pipe troubles at Trees Gym are the.

Pitt swimmers. The tankers have
been making use of the YMHA pool
during the past week, and accord-
ing to Coach Ben Grady, "It’s a
break for us.” _ y 1

The Y pool is 25 yards long,
while the Trees tankis five shorter.
"This extra five yards makes a
lot of difference on our away meets,”
Grady explained. "Most of them
are run off on 25-yard pools. And
our boys, having practiced on the
20-yard "course, sometimes don*t
get used to the added five yardsﬂ’

“That means that at 17 yards
the boys lift their heads since
they’re conditioned to doing this
at Trees. iNow at the Y, they will
be. able to swim 22 yards before
looking‘ for the wall.” '

Meanwhile Grady is preparing
his frosh squad for their opening
engagement with the‘ Y team on

Dec. 14. Grady has a good group
of promising youngsters, who will
be able to supplement his var-
sity last year. They will be rac-
ing against the team of their former
coach, lack Morris.

Grady has entered nine boys in
the meet. Bob Lipiane and link
Stark, who were junior AMA-AAU

champs in the breast stroke and
distance respectively, will head
the group.

In the meantime, the varsity is
still keeping in form. Their first
dual meet is not until Ian. _7 when

monia gas-filled earpiece inside
a helmet by which a quarterback
on the field could receive instruc-
-tions from the bench.

With such an intrument the up-
to-date coach could tell his quarter-
"back which played to call without
having to send in a mailman in a
football uniform.

Of course, the quarterback will
have to be trustworthy. Otherwise,
when he disagreeswith the coach's
judgment he can make his own
choice and later tell the DOSS,
"Sorry, chief, there was interfer-
ence on the intercom.” '

At any rate, future huddle con-
versations are liable to go some-
thing like this: "Hello, quarter-

‘only against four men as the Pio-

A It was the second half shooting
of Jones, who scored 11 points‘,
which resulted in the Civils sec-

it ond triumph of the season. An-

other important factor was a solid
Civil defense which was only

The Faculty Diehards, members

their second victory in as many

Grays, 29-21.

A hard-fought first half resulted
with a score of 15-12 in favor of
the Diehards. Tall Lou llough with
his rebounds off the banks ac-
counted for ten of these points.

The second half showed the
Faculty being sparked by the play

B.V.P. racked up a four point
lead at the half, at which time
Munhall looked as though_ they
would go down to their second
straight defeat. Instead, Ken Chu-
ska and Dave Anderson thumped
points through the hoop with reg-
ularity to give the Munhall entry
a commanding lead which they
never relinquished.

The victory makes the Munhall
record read (1-1) thus far in the
National League.

Although this was the initial
game for the Beaver Valley boys,
they revealed a real point getter
in John Frkuska, who bagged 10 of
the teams 19 points. Ken Chuska
scored eight points, while his

Third Brother at Pitt

By DON MURDOCK

A 6-3, 165-pound package marked
“Do not open until after Christmas”
has been handed to Frosh Basket-
ball Coach Bobby Artman.

The package is Mickey Zernich,
an All-State center from Aliquippa,
whose ability at Pitt won't be
learned until after Christmas when
the frosh basketball schedule be-
gins.

A tall, lean center, Mickey comes
to Pitt with the hopes of following
in the footsteps of his two basket-
ball playing brothers, Wally and
Steve.

Coach Has Praise

Wally was a steady and depend-
able scorer for Doc Carlson in
1945 and 1946. Steve was a higx
scoring guard for Carlson in 1942.

Sam Milanovich, head basketball
coach at Aliquippa High, has noth-

This statement is quite a recom-

also tutored both Wally and Steve.
Milanovich, an ex—Quip basketball
player, apparantly rates Mickey
better than himself, too.

Good on Taps

Milanovich continued by saying,
"Mick was very good on tap plays
from the foul line. Although he
wasn't our tallest boy, he was our
smartest on these plays.”

Mickey was a standout at Ali-

he paced the ,‘Quips ,to the state

through 29 games without a defeat
to complete one of their best sea-

Browne Memorial Room Creates

Victorian Age in Modern Setting

By DAVE ‘WINTER

You can take an express elevator
to the Victorian era.

Thirty-three floors above the
bustle of Fifth Avenue there is a
little old-fashioned ‘sitting room
complete with a grandfather’s clock
and Victorian _period furniture. The
polished wood ofbookcases gleams.
dul1y.Thackeray, Dickens, Cooper,
Byron-they are all there.

' On one wall hangs a framed re-
ligious motto, and leaning against
thewall on top of one of the book-
cases is‘ a small faded photo of
Abraham Lincoln.

Above another bookcase is a
100—year-old painting showing a
forested hill sloping down to the
point where the Allegheny, Ohio,
and Monongahela rivers meet, the
place where the Golden Triangle
stands today. .

The room is the Anna Moody
Browne memorial room.

Many years ago, the Browne
family lived on the site now oc-
cupied by the Cathedral of Learn-
ing. In their house the Cathedral
was planned, and the famous Nat-
ionality rooms were designed.

The Brownes were one of the
leading families in Oakland at a
time when none of the present
buildings which make it a cult-
ural center existed.

The room was donated by Miss
Browne as a memorial to her par-
ents. ‘ I

At the formal ceremony in 1947,
in which Chancellor R.H. Fitz-
gerald accepted the gift on behalf
of the University, the room was
dedicated as "...a visible proof
of her devotion to here kindred, her
community, and her religious c'bn—
victions.”

=l= * *

Chancellor Fitzgerald, accepting
the gift, said, "This room  re-
presents the best of life as it was
lived in this very community, on
the very plot where the Cathedral
of Learning now stands. Here is a
room from a family home. Here are
the books they read; here are the
chairs they sat in; here is the
clock that measured time for them,
and the motto which catches up
their faith in the Lord.”

See Maze of Pipes

Choosing to favor another local
plant, the class toured the Gulf
Refining plant at Neville Island.
Here they saw such a complex
maze of pipelines that it was un-
animously agreed plumbing might
be more profitable.

According to W. A. Schratz, in-
structor in industries, the class
helps to fill the gap between theory
and practice by giving Bus Ad stu-
dents “an opportunity to acquaint
themselves with the inner processes
in modern manufacturing.”

The first field trip brought the
class very close to actual prac-
tice, in fact, almost too close for
comfort. Mr. Schratz took his class
to a Bureau of Mines station at
Bruceton,' Pa., a U.S. government
agency that conducts experiments
in mine safety.

Two Explosions

In demonstrating the effective-
ness of a ventilation unit, l_3ureau
personnel set off two bone-rattling
coal dust explosions for the class.

As far as the students were con-
cerned, one would have been quite
sufficient. But the experimenters,
in their enthusiastic way, exposed
the class to one detonation out-
side the mine shaft and another in-
side.

To get through the mine, Schratz
and his crew were obliged to grope
their way along’, dark, restricted
passageways, averaging five feet
