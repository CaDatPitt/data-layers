The plays given on Wednesday,
March 31, in the Heinz House, for the
beneﬁt of the W. A. A. were successes,
both dramatically and ﬁnancially. The
music for the program was furnished
by the Gir1’~s_ - Ukelelev Club. “The
Teeth of the Gig Horse-”~ proved a.
delightful comedy. It represented the
complications in which a young wife
can become involved, if she sends to a
“rummage sale” the beautiful, but
rather passe, hand-painted vases of a
beloved aunt. The events, which led
to the return of the fateful b_ric-a-brac
and the ﬁnal presentation of a “hand-
some” hand-painted clock, were droll.
Sarah Marsteller, as “Aunt Marietta";
Ruth McDaviid, as “Katie,” «a maid,
and Alena Horner, as “Develin Blake,”
played their parts well. ‘_ _

"The Land of Heart's. Desire," by
William B. Yeats, was the second play.
The playlet, as an expression of Irish
folk-lore, had a deﬁnite appeal to the
auditors. Madge Grubb, as “Bridget
Bruin"; Lulu Witherow, as “Mary
Bruin”; Ann e Klingensmith, as
“Father Hart," and ‘Ester Barton, as
“A Faery Child,” did ‘commendable

PLANS
‘ Hill SENIBR nun:

Plans are under way for this year's
Senior Dance. Chairman Charles Cor-
bit of the School of Engineering is
getting an early start, in order that
plenty of time may be available to
work up the dance. so that it may be
the most successful. event of its kind
ever» held at Pitt, and at any rate the
most successful social function of the
present school year. The personnel of
the committee for the event was an-
nounced in last week's issue of The
Pitt Weekly.’ Charles Corbit, Eng.
'20, is chairman; Frank B. Maxﬁeld.
Ec. '20, is business manager, and
Henry D. Fulton is publicitf manager-
In addition there will be one repre-
sentative on the committee from each
school of the University, whose duty it
will be to enlist the support of their
respective schools and have charge of
the sale of tickets, which will be on
hand in a short time.

Pending the first general committee
meeting, no announcement has been
made as to the orchestra. whichwill be
engaged -‘i'or‘this event, but it is as-
sured that the snappiest music that .is
"available ‘will, be secured.. It is un-

With the usual pepand enthusiasm,
the Spring Issue of The Pitt Panther
was placed on sale yesterday morning
in Thaw and State halls. The issue
numbered 36 pages. The circu1atio__n

department, which had charge of the
distribution was rushed, especially
when classes were changing. It is be-
-lieved that more copies were sold of
the Spring Issue than any other pre-
ceeding one. _

The cover, designed by “Mike”
Hartnett, characterizes the usual
spirit of the spring time, which so
often makes one feel vigorous and
leads him on to big things. In this
respect., The Panther staff has worked

“howling success." , .

Good judgment was used by the
editors in the selection of the material
for the spring issue. Nothing oifend-
ing has been found within the pages
that will arouse the mind of the most
skeptical reader. The Panther is a
publication that goes home to father,

Former Army Photographer,

Who Took Groups Around

« Coblenz, Will Photograph
Pittites

 

' A photograph of all students, faculty
and oﬁicials of the University of Pitts-
burgh, with The Pitt Panther outlined
in silhouette, will be taken this com-
ing Friday at 10:30 on the Eighteenth
Regiment parade grounds, rea.r of the
armory. This move has received the
endorsement and hearty approval of
the University authorities. Classes
will be discontinued during that hour,
to allow all students to participate in
the photograph, and will resume at
11:30. Complete plans for this event
will be announced to the student body
at the assembly exercises in Memorial
Hall today, by Major Roy H. Evans,
the photographer in charge.

Since the picture will be designed
for a. speciﬁc number of persons, it is
especially desired that the student
body turn out in full force. The
photograph will be extensively used in
Pitt Publicity campaigns, and it is
thought will do much to acquaint the
public with the“ facilities and advant-
ages offered by this University. These
pictures will later be offered for sale
to the student body.

Major Evans has had considerable
experience in taking of such photo-
graphs. Among these are group pic-
tures taken of the Army of Occupa-
tion about Coblenzyone of them in-

luding 17,000 A. E. F. troops. As‘

stated, the proﬁle of The Pitt Panther
will be made in silhouette, to occupy
the center of the photograph, and will
be inclosed by an appropriate shield,
so as to produce the proper eﬁect.

Building Insured

The military storehouse of the R. O.
T. C. department of the Universit ,
situated at Bigelovr boulevard and
Parkman street, behind State Hall,
was destroyed by ﬁre early Friday
morning. The loss was estimated by
the Pittsburgh papers to be $50,000.
The University authorities say that
they will be unable to give an exact
estimate, until a more detailed in-
vestigation is made. The building was
insured.

Four alarms were sounded, ﬁremen
from the Oakland, East End, Lawrence-
ville and downtown districts ﬁghting
the ﬁre. The ﬁrst alarm was sounded
at 4:36 ‘o'clock by a pedestrian. Ad-
ditional alarms were rung in after
firemen from Oakland arrived at the
scene and discovered. the extent of the
blaze. '

fire, experiencing diﬂiculty in direct-
ing the water on the ﬂames. The roof
of the building collapsed a few minutes
before 6 o’clock, causing the walls to
fall in. Due to the fact that surround-
ing buildings were. constructed of ﬁre-
proof material, a more serious blaze
was averted. A report circulated that.
ammunition was stored in the build-
ing. This was later proved to be
erroneous.

Windows in State Hall were broken
by the heart of the ﬂames. On the-.
third floor, where the University li-

bookcases were burned. The library
was closed during the ea.rly part of
the week, so that it could be repaired.

Many classes were changed, the ﬁre
having damaged class rooms in the
back part of State Hall, where many
windows were destroyed. It was neces-
sary to move all R. O. T. C. classes to
other buildings in the campus. Uni-
versity authorities were unable to
state whether another building would
be erected on the destroyed site.

McCormick for Presi'de‘nt.

In presenting for the ofllce of presi-
dent of the association the name oi’ ,
Ross T. McCormick, ’88_. the Nominat-
ing Committee believes that it has se-
lected one of,the strongest possible
candidates. Mr. McCormick’s loyal‘
service to Pitt covers three decades.
for since the day he graduated he,hasV
never failed to take a most active part
in the aﬁairs of the al1i.:n~niAa11d,in.an7‘r . ,
‘movement-‘beneﬁcial to the Univei'.;1iA.ty, A
 eiideavors rea.r.=..‘m>.d :~..'.o.iirnait‘
recen-ti Alumni Bui?.dvF;~.g Campézig,‘ git‘,
which he" not only acted as classi;sftﬁ;g'.~'«
retary but called upon the othe1':5;lAuAtn-‘
nitin Irwin, and he is famous-i‘or.his’
own generosity toward the University.
Years ago Mr. McCormick was the
unpaid but very efﬁcient secretary of
the Alumni Association in the days
when that body was much smaller and
less vigorous than it has since he-
come, and he did much to hold it to-
gether and develop its relationship to
the University. He has previously
served as 9. member of Alumni Coun-
cil, and it may be of interest to add
that he is a brother-in-law of C. W.
Ridinger, ‘S3, and a cousin of Chan-
cellor M00-orznick. How’s that for a
Pitt Family?

Dr. E. A Weiss, named for vice pres-
ident of the General Association, is
one of. the leading physicians oi‘. the
city, there being «perhaps no better-
known or more highly respected mem-
ber of the profession inthis district.
Like Mr. McCormick, he has been ac-.
tive throughout his years an as alum-
nus, taking an especially valuable in-
terest in the Phi Beta. Pi fraternity. of
which he is a member. Dr. Weiss was
3. member of the -School of Medicine
Comm.ittee in the Alumni Building
Campaign. He is a member of the.
and of the
staif of the Mercy Hospital, and has
been active in the Allegheny County
Medical Society. Vvhile he is espec-
ially well known to the Medical Alum-
ni. he has a great many friends among
the graduates of other schools.

' B. H. Smyers, '93, and K. E. Davis,
’10. are renominaterl for the positions
which they have ﬁlled for  number.
of years, those of treasurer and s=.ecrc-
tary, respectively. Comment uP011

The Council Candidates.

Half of the ﬁfty members of. Alum-
ni Council go out of oﬁice this ‘-year,
and of the 25 no less than 20 have.
been placed on the ticket for reelec-
tion. There has never been 8. year in

we discovered that only the- wooden

burned and that,,with the exception
of a few windows in the back, in the
library and afew other rooms all the
rest of the building‘ was all right. Of
course, the sociology department lost

ing to the communication, the univer-
sity has been compelled to close its
doors because of the distressing situa-
tion of its professors, many of them
being deprived of the barest neces-
sities of life. ‘ A

_A number of other colleges’ and
universities throughout the country
have received similar letters, in which
appeals were made for instant relief.
The money donated will be used in the
purchase of food and clothing for the
sufferers, since, it is declared, eatables
are not obtainable at any price in
Vienna. Raising of funds at Pitt was
directed by Dr. J. F. L. Raschen, sec-
retary of‘ the graduate school, and head
of the department of German.

The fact that University graduates
need suffer no lack of experience, if
they have a certain amount of initia-
tive and energy is forcibly demon-
strated by the fellowships oﬁered to
them. Several have been announced
recently.

The Graduate School of Yale an-.

nounces two Sessel fellowships- for Re-
search, of $1,000 each, for original re-
search in the Bi_oI'ogical Sciences.
These are open to either men or wo-
men, preferably to those who have re-

' ceived a doctorate from some univer-

sity of high standing, and have demon-
strated their ability in previous work.

The Imperial College of London an-
nounces the seventh annual election of
Fellows in July, 1920, for the Belt Fel-
lowshops for Scientiﬁc Research. Not
more than three fellowships will be
awarded, and compensation will be
graded according to ability. Applica-
tions must be in before April 19, 1920.
Those wishing to apply or desiring in-
formation are referred to the Rector
of the Imperial College, London, or to

out-of-doors this week, when ‘the
weather permitted. The beneﬁts of

rainy weather would otherwise force
a lay-off, for now a. continuous training
season is made possible. The showers

form for the Penn Relays, whichimark
the inauguration of the outdoor track
season. -

April 30-May .1, so that Coach Kerr
has, approximately, one month in
which to shape up and mould out his
relay combination.
deﬁnitely decided that Pittwillrun in
the Class A relay, one class below the
championships. In Class A, with Pitt,
are such teams of calibre as Syracuse,
Penn State, Columbia and three or
four others, so that this class ranks
but slightly behind the championship
group, which includes Penn,‘ Cornell,
Princeton, Yale, Harvard, Chicago and
often, as is the case this year, Oxford
and Cambridge.

In addition to the Class A relay the
team will also be entered in the sprint
medley. which consists of two 220's, a.
440 and a half-mile. Practically every
big institution is. entered in this relay,
as it is run on Friday, April 30, while
both the championships and the Class
A relay come on Saturday.

Two years ago the Pitt team, com-
posed of Peters, - Shea, Eckhardt,
Speck and Albright, made a name for
itself in the track world by winning
the three important events of the re-
lays,- the sprint medley, Class A, and
the championships. It was the first
and probably will be the only time that
a team has hung up such a perform-
ance. .

Last year Pennsylvania won both
the sprint medley and the champion-
ship one-mile relay Pitt ran in the
championship class last year, more as
an act of defending a title than’ any
real qualiﬁcation for that class, but
this year no such obl’n'o.tion is felt

A and the team will content itself with

winning Class A. There is just a bare

J possibility that a team may be enter-

ed in the two-mile cl1ampion::;11ip, but
as that event is expected to be par-
ticularly classy this year, there is
undoubtedly a. far better chance in
the Class A one—mile and Coach Kerr
intends to concentrate on that event.

_In addition to the relays, Brickley
and Martin, provided they both make
the team, will be entered in the 440-
yard hurdles, and it is possible that
one or two others may compete in
special events.
