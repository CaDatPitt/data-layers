We have reported football games,

Community Forum

University Professor, Now Labor Board Head,

Prophesies Move Toward

Industrial Democracy

By IRVING BENNETT

Prophesying a movement towards industrial denioci'ac,vll Banquet

based on the Wagner Labor Act, J. Warren Madden, chairman
of the National Labor Relations Board and University law pro-
fessor on leave of absence, closed the year for the Pittsburgh

Community Forum.

Before a packed audience at Schenley high school, Mad-

den declared, “the industrial situation
looks promising. Employers and em-
ployees, with the removal of the be-
lief that laws and the courts are
against them, may lay a real basis
for industrial peace.”

In the thirty days since the Su-
preme Court passed favorably on the
Wagner Act, the National Labor Re-
lations Board, said Madden, has been
swamped with cases. Employees and
employers are showing a willingness
to cooperate. “The Wagner Act,” he
declared, “can prove a great asset to-
wards stabilizing American demoe-
racy. People are going to ask for a
good deal-—not the impossible. There
is much in the present situation to
make us feel that we may look for-
ward conﬁdently.”

CASES INCREASE

Madden laid the great increase in
the amount of cases before the Labor
Relations Board to the Supreme Court
decision of April 12, in which the
Wagner Act was declared constitu-
tional. Passed in 1935, ‘the Wagner
Act had not been voted upon before.
It was in 1935 that President Roose-
velt named Madden chairman of the
Board established under the Wagner
Act. Since then Madden has been on
leave of absence from the University.

A report submitted to the Forum
by Leo G. Griffith, treasurer, at the
beginning of the meeting showed a
balance on hand of $57 7. Comparing
this to the balance of $918 of last
year, Dr. Bernard Clausen, chairman,
asked that ﬁnancial support be given
to the Forum.

Summarizing the work of the past
year, W. W. Mendenhall, chairman of
the program committee, listed speaker
possibilities for next year. Among the
list were the names of Congressman
Maury Maverick of Texas, Governor
Frank Murphy of Michigan, H. G.
Wells, and Colonel H. Norman
Schwartzkoipf, former New Jersey
State Police head. It was announced
that plans were being discussed for
‘the formation of community forums
in twenty neighboring districts. These
would be linked with the Pittsburgh
group.

Graduate
Named Canton,

China, Mayor

A graduate of the University in
1924, Tseng Yang-Flu is now mayor
of Canton, China, and is Minister of
Railways for China.

Graduating from Pei Yang U ni.ver-
sity in China with the BS degree in
1923, Tseng Yang-Fu came to Pitts-
burgh and entered the graduate
school. Here he majored in general
mining courses in the school of mines,
receiving the MS degree from Pitt
in 1924.

At Pitt he received his degree un-
der the name of Hsien Hao Tseng,
but now has his family name first and
has changed his name to Tseiig Yang-
Fu.

E. H. Lockwood, secretary of the
YMCA in Canton says that Tseiig rc-
members the friends he made in
Pittsburgh. Tseng was on the Com-
mittee of Nanking to make the de-
cision to contribute funds for the Ca-
thedral of Learning’s China Room,
first of the 17 nationality groups to
complete its room fund.

Lockwood reports that Tscng is a
high type official who is doing much
to improve Canton. His knowledge of
engineering has aided him in his work.

He doubtless possesses the
ability to get in there and keep
plugging. Active in gymnastics
for nine years, Wheeler has put more
hoursof continuous practice in‘the
gymnasium of the North Side Com-
munity House than most people spend
in eating.

LONG PRACTICE HOURS

Week in and week out, breaking
the schedule only long enough to
take a few vacations, Wheeler has
been going through the various gyin-
nastic movements three to hve hours
a day-for a-weekly average of four
days ove_r the last nine years. I

Wheeler’s career has brought him
along the championship route from
the very beginning. In the season_of
’31-32, compe'tiiig for South H1115
High School, he won the city scholas-
tic cliampionsliip. _ . _

Last year,‘ placing sixth_ in the
AAU competition, he was picked as
a member of the United States Olym-
pic team and participated, 11115110‘
cessfully, in the Berlin games-
DEFEATS CUMISKEY

In the championships held Satur-
day at the U. P. Community Ilouse,
Wheeler defeated the defending
champion, Frank Cumiskey of Union
City, New Jersey. Gaming an ad-
vantage of six points in the calisthen-
ics and long horse exercises, Wheel-
er’s margin of victory was extreme-
ly close, 296 to 292.4.

Wheeler was graduated from the
School of Education _last June with
highest honors. He is serving ap-
prenticeship for a high school teach-
ing career by working as a gradu-
ate assistant in the biology depart-
ment.

Gymnastics is one of those sports
that is hidden away in a dark, cob-
webby corner, as far as the general
athletics public is concerned. How-
ever, the sport has a strong follow-
ing among the physical education stu-
dents and disciples in this country. It
is more popular in foreign countries,
Germany being the outstanding ex-
ample. It is a major sport in the
Rliincland. ’

Wheeler's competition consisted of
exercises in calisthenics, long horse,
side horse, parallel bars, horizontal
bars, and rin-gs. The judging is done
in much the same manner as in div-
ing, on a decimal point basis as de-
termined by a group of judges who
consider grace, symmetry, skill, and
difficulty of execution.

Pitt Golfers

Meet Carnegie C

Smarting from the unexpected set-
backs of last week-end, the Pitt golf-
ers seek some measure of vindication
this afternoon when they tee off with
the Carnegie Tech Tartans in a match
at Alcoma Country Club, the second
of the year.

Just a week and a half ago, the
Panthers blasted Tech into an 8-1 de-
feat on the Tech home course, Pitts-
burgh Field Club. The personnel of
the teams has not changed since then
although Coach Art Snyder, Pitt
mentor, is considering a change in the
playing order of his line-up.

The same six who played last time
will do 'the club swinging again.
Frank Souchak, Frank Bonoratti,
Tony Kay, Bob Baughman, Bill Dad-
dio, and Carl Walmsley will shoot for
the Panthers. There is some doubt
over the sixth position. Eddie Lawry
might do the swinging in place of
Walinsley. They have been alternat-
ing for the past few matches.

Friday the Panthers will go back
to the Eastern Iiitercolle"iate Golf As-
sociation cornpetition. They play Penn
State and Cornell on Friday and Sat-
urday respectively. These matches will
be played at State College.

Olson Next

Fresh Face Altoona
This Afternoon, Seek
Undefeated Season

Trying to forget about Penn State
and beginning to ‘think about Army
doesn’t keep Carl Olson, varsity track
coach in the best humor these days.
Saturday, his once-beaten tracknien
face the Si.1‘OIl;;‘Cf$i. team they have had
to meet this year when they run
against the Army at West Point.

While the Panthers v;ei'e dropping
a really tough one to the Nittaiiy
Lions, the Cadets were bombarding
New York Uiiiversily. The Army
doubled the scoi'e on their able down-
state rivals in a dual nicct Saturday.

This afternoon, at the Stadium,
Coach Jinmiy Potts’ uncoiiquercd
freslimcii meet the state iiitcr.<cliol;is-
‘tic clianipions, Altooiia, a dual
meet. Meetiiig the scliolastic cliamps
for the fourth time, the Little Pan-
thers will be out to gain an advan-
tage in the series. It is all even now
with one victory and one dcfca't
apiece, the other match being a tie.

JAVELIN A WORRY

One of the added ivriiikles in the
Olsen brow is caused by the javelin
event. Weak in the other ﬁeld events,
Pitt has had a coiisisteiit javelin win-
ner in Gene Tazmo. As a matter of
fact, Taaiio has only been beaten by
his former teammate, Charley Gong-
loﬁ’, in dual competition during his
entire three-year college career.

From the records that the Army has
made this season, Taano is in extreme
danger of losing to an intei'collcgiate
opponent for the iiixst time in a dual
meet. Clark, the West Point pole
thrower, (lel'c:.ited defeiicliiig champion
Taano in the Penn Relay Champion-
ships a few weeks ago.

Of couse at that time Taano was
still under wraps because of a back
injury sustained in indoor hammer
practice. But then again, Clark’s heave
was over 213 feet, a mark Taano has
never surpassed. L

With Steady Play

Toniorrow the Pitt‘ netmen meet
Bethany on Trees courts in the ﬁfth
match of the season before leaving
for Peim State to face the strong Lion
a;_:'gi‘egatioii on Saturday. Although
the Panthers have dropped a few sets
to Grove City and Duquesiie, the
courtinen have kept their slate clean
and are on their way to what looms
as their ﬁrst undefeated season
years.

Only Bob Madden and Ralph Bald,
who are undefeated in match play
this season, showed real tennis form
at Grove City last Saturday. Madden,
playing his last year at Pitt, is worth
watching in match play. His stroking
is smooth and powerful, and his
drives sizzle as they cross the net. The
handful of spectators Saturday re-
ceived a real tennis lesson from
watching Bob’s playing.

TECH MATCH MAY 18

Manager Bud Mayer hoped to
schedule the postponed Indiana State
Teachers match for today, but at
present all the arrangements have not
been completed. The unplayed match
with the Rockets from Slippery Rock
will be set ahead to a later date.

Carnegie Tech’s tennis squad, fast-
growing in fame because of its wom-
an star, Naomi Thompson, will op-
pose the Panthers in only one match
this season, May 18. Even now the
team is talking about the titantic
match Johnny Megan will play with
Mrs. Thompson.

“The eiitzire fi *st round of the Uni-
versity tournament will have "to be
ﬁnished by Friday, or matches will be
forfeited,” Manager Mayer said to-
day. l.n the only match played this
week Clark defeated Bennett 4-6, 6-1,

Cooperation

THE Pitt Cooperative Club, with a membership
of approximately 50, is striving to secure bene-
ﬁts for the undergraduate body. The group, fol-
lowing the lead of 130 colleges including Temple,
Harvard, and the University of Southern Cali-
fornia, are attempting to get reduced prices for
students in book-buying, restaurants, theaters,
gasoline stations, and tailoring shops.

And the only way these may be achieved is
through the cooperation of a large number of
undergraduates. A cooperative system can only
be successful when it has a mass buying power
to back it-. Hampered by a lack of credit this club,
nevertheless, will open a bookstore this fall offer-
ing student texts at wholesale prices. Of course,
it will probably not be able to provide books for
every course, but it will be a beginning.

The college cooperative is no new movement.
For 40 years, students have been organizing non-
proﬁting systems for their own beneﬁt. The pay-
ment of membership dues of ﬁfty cents per year
and the promise to support those businesses of-
fering reductions contributes to a power that will
afford beneﬁts still unrealized.

In addition to its bookstore project, members
already get reductions from a local restaurant,
and a downtown theater. Investigation of clean-
ing and pressing service for resident students is
also being undertaken.

Working with a nucleus of 25 since Christmas,
it has accomplished all this. There is no reason
why it will not complete its plans and even en-
large its activities. This organization deserves
the support and commendation of the students
because it considers a portion of their welfare
which the University has overlooked or neglect-
ed.—S.S.

BEFORE stepping into the College Club’s Uni-
versity-popular banquet room for its annual
steak-and-green-peas dinner, newly-elected mem-
bers of the Student-Faculty Assembly took time
off to select their 1937-38 executive committee
while seniors and un-reelected juniors looked on.

That Al Barr, Les Hamburg, and Lucy Conn
would be the fraternity candidates has been a
foregone conclusion ever since the election. That
Bill Stark, Ernie Rose, and Verna Douglas would
get the call from the independents was almost
as deﬁnite. That all six would be elected to the
executive committee was a result which hardly
needed a vote to make it official. All this had
been decided in the past two weeks at group
meetings.

Now the next thing on the SFA agenda is the
selection of the president, to be made by the nine
members of the executive committee, which in-
cludes the above six students and three adminis-
tration members.

Fundamentally, all this electioneering and mass
action on and before April 23 had one objective
——to elect the president. He it is who makes all
the committee appointments, and is the central
ﬁgure in any drive for political domination. The
fraternity coalition wanted the presidency in
order to assure for themselves, if possible, the
gravy. The independents wanted the presidency
in order to prevent the fraternity men from do-
ing just that.

So they held a big election and then each group
got together to select its half of the executive
committee. And the grand total of all this con-
flict is that three fraternity men will vote for a
predetermined fraternity candidate, three inde-
pendents will vote for an independent candidate
just as much predetermined, and three members
of the University administration will elect the
president by casting the deciding votes.

Until a coalition is formed which is strong
enough to secure 20 or more seats in the assem-
bly and thereby elect ﬁve or six members to the
executive committee, this will continue to be the
case. And considering the recent fraternity at-
tempt, such an eventuality seems almost impos-
sible.

The point, then, revolves about whether the
faculty should continue to elect the “best man,”
or whether the majority in the assembly should
be permitted to choose the president, best man or
not best man.

An amendment to permit a majority vote for
the presidency was defeated by this year’s as-
sembly.

It would be begging the question if we should
wonder whether the entire student body prefers
the present so-called “aristocracy” to a democra-
cy of unproved merit.

So we'll beg the question. . .

He Talked
To Himself

By Milton G. Lehman, Jr.

 

The fairy tale, with wlrz'.rLtion.s-, is America's pro-
fcrrcd lztcmture from the cradle to _thc gravc.—LouIs

‘I O
A l<au°y Tale

Once upon a time there was a delightful young lady,
known by few. l-ler country and the world scarcely real-
ized that she existed. She lived in a town where people
held parties and went to good plays and heard hnc
operas, and she was merely a part. of the town. Her
name was Molly.

As Molly matured, she took herself a husband, and
with him tried to build a home in the little town. But
from the rafters of the framework _to the glass panes on
the windows, the sanctum shook with mner strife.

Mirztrcatnicnt, abuse, and trampled temperament came
with the time. Her first mate was followed by a second,
and failure continued.

One day, in a celebration zittcndcd by the lofty, Molly,
traveling alone, found herselfintroduced to a young
person of some 40 years by name of Ned. (Or _so he
called himself in those days.) Ned, Molly learned 1n the
coursc of the evening, as unfortunate too. Destiny had
mixed things up collsidbrably, and the young man was
beginning ‘to find his burden too much to bear. But when
he met her, Ned colifessed later, Molly’_s sweetness, mlxed
with 21 naivcte, tempered 1n soplnsticatlon, overcame lnm.
But little did she know the spell she had woven.

After several dates with Ned, Molly fell in love, very
madly in love. She was 'sure_of rt. Ned asked for her
hand, and she would have granted It mnnedlately, had it
not been tied to her second husband. Co11side1'a.t1o_ns
and }»a.i‘l¢g\‘il.1;.:s gzwc way to c<)n.:-‘exit. l:"'im1.ll_v it seemed
probable that the wrctch of a l1u.~i.baud would rclmqulsh
the woman whom he had never pleased.

Wedding bells were near. Then Molly, to her asto11i:sl1-
mcnt and surprise, discovered that Ned was not it com-
mon mortal with common burdens. Ile was, he admitted
finally, a King.

* * *

Grief soon came lo Molly and Ned. Great Oflicialszili
the State proclaimed to ‘the skies that they could not
sanction the marriage. They oraculnted that Ned must
seek in Noble Circles for his mate.

Molly met her dilemma. A king with a throne, and she
alone . . . or was it to be a king de'th1'oned and Molly?
She argued for separatioli. Ned refused. The Great
Officials held fast; Ned would not relinquish Molly. The
crisis come, Molly left the country of Ned for a land
ac1‘o:5s the water.

And so it came about lllill. Ned refused ‘to obey the
Officials, demanded Molly for his own, and, placing the
Crown in its velveteen case, went as Private Citizen
No. 1 across the water Into the 21171115 of his beloved.

Molly and Ned were niurried amid great splendor. Peo-
ple applauded the happy pair. Ned hadvreleased his bur-
den; Molly had found her happiness. Is it necessary to
say they lived and loved happily ever after?

Epilogue
The romzmcc of Nod and Molly has taken the world by

storm. “The greatest love story ever told,” critics de-
clared. “Handled with perfect style,” literarians oplned.

Mr. Untcrmeyer is right. We have all read the story
of Molly and Ned. We have lived it with our morning
orange juice; we have cliscussctl it after our lunch; we
have read it in extra editions before retiring.

Truth is stranger than ﬁction, even though it be
touched with a journalist’s ’r.ypcwriter. At any rate, we
shall get tonigh't’s paper to follow new developments.

Hj ichristodoulou: An Anecdote

Sandwiches and the Brooklyn Bridge don"t seem to
have any connection, but to Panayiotis Hjichristodoulou,
a native of the Island of Cyprus and a student at Rens-
selaer Polytechnic Institute, no two things have a more
deﬁnite relationship.

In 1930 he landed in New York with $17 in his
pocket and no language to help him become a part of
the rush.

Sight of the Brooklyn bridge made him gasp. What
a miracle that man could have built it! When he learned
that Washington A. Roe-bling, chief engineer of the
project, had graduated from Rensselae1' Polytechnic In-
stitute, he wanted to attend at any cost.

Hired by'a restaurant proprietor in Westbury, L. l.,
Hjichristodoulou was able to keep his stomach filled
and his back covered and, at the same time, complete
a heavy high school course in two years.

During his first two years at RPI, he worked in a Troy
restaurant from 5 p.m. to 2 a.m. daily for 12 dollars a
week and meals. Finding too little time to study in his
last two years he quit this work and took odd jobs.

Since then it has been a dull parade of sandwiches
and coffee, coffee and sandwiches——with a picture of
the Brooklyn bridge to remind him that maybe a ham-
burger clapped between two pieces of bread wasn't
so bad at that.

Impressed with his perseverance, RPI authorities
loaned him money to pay half of his tuition. All other
expenses he met himself. When asked, in a lunch stand,
whether the long struggle had paid, he said:

“The Brooklyn bridge has cost me a lot of sandwiches,
but it was worth it.”

A dime jingled on the counter. “ . .

. and a cup of
coffee.”

Pursecution

The quantity of things a woman can carry in her
purse has long been a subject of conversa'tion among
college men. Now there is an addition to lipsticks, hair
pins, rubbers, and paper clips. It seems that at the Uni-
vers1ty_of Wisconsin one of the coeds lost her handbag
at a nlght club outside of Madison. She didn't notice
the loss until returning to her sorority house after the
date.

Instead of fussing around and driving out to the
club the next day, she decided to wait until the fol-
lowiraj Saturday when she had a date to go there again.

At the check-room, she asked if anyone had found
her bag. Several were brought out. Could she identify
hers by the contents?

Logic (In .41 Buggy Ride
l'jS'I‘ SOl‘.ll‘l THINK otherwise the
purpose of this paper is not to de-

fend Mussolini, I have somewhat less
than admiration for him. Yet I do
think it is necessary that writers in
commenting upon the situation should
not, like Westbrook Pegler so fre-
quently does, let their emotions get
the better of their logic.

Because Mussolini is so easy to
make fun of writers ought not to let
their thinking faculties atrophy.
They should not be tempted to desert
their proper role of intellectual criti-
cism because Il Duce offers so broad
a target for their shafts.

The same holds true with Hitler
and the rest of the world’s “Men on
Horseback.” Because these men are
part and parcel of a system adjudged
bad, the democratic public sits back as
if it were at a vaudeville show and
claps its hands in approval when some

writer or speaker sinks a rather well- '

worn barb in the nether regions ofa
particular dictator.

It is the easiest thing in the world
to write a funny d.a-‘_r,-.be on Hitler
or Mussolini, because we are always
in the mood to accept such diatribes.
But if made a steady diet, such writ-
ing is bound to become as enervating
as the propaganda that the dictators
feed to their publics. In fact, it is
propaganda and of a vicious sort.

THE DOCTRINE of free press, as it

condemns license, also implicitly
condemns those who do not exercise
freedom to the highest degree that
they are capable of. It is violation
of a free press to demean it by rather
rabble rousing when it is within the
scope of the writer to do full justice
to his topic.

Credit or sumpin must be given to
“l)arkic” Bud Cornelius for changing
love affairs quicker than you can
say, well, let’s say Jack Robinson
. . . Bud can be deeply in love with
a little southern Mary Lou one week
and upon asking him about the prog-
less of his love affair the following,
he will nonchalantly reply that Mary
Jane Patterson is positively the tops
. . . Not seeing Mary Jane’s picture
on his desk a short time later you
will discover that he is going steady

It is rumored that the Sigma Chis A
are causing a bit of distraction‘ to the ,

future debs at the Ellis School . . .
Because of this, Prexie Blum was
summoned for questioning by Miss
Ellis. . . In the course of the conversa-
tion Blum was heard to say, “I don’t

‘think you need worry, Miss Ellis, be- ~

cause your girls are only in high
school.” . . . The Sigma Chi top-knot

seems to forget that only last year «

he was seen in the company of a high
school girl not infrequently. .
