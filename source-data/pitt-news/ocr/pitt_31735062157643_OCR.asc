New Athletic Director
,To Take Over Post

Early in

February

 

_ BULLETIN
Captain Tom Hamilton accepted the post of‘ athletic director
_ yesterday. He phoned Chancellor Rufus H. Fitzgerald from Angapolis

at 1:30 p. m. to reveal that his

naval resignation had been given

ﬁnal approval at a Monday morning meeting in Washington, D. C.

Hamilton will not take over the job until Feb. 1. No contract

- has been signed as yet, but this‘ is regarded as mere formality.

Another conference with Navy authorities yesterdav was
the last barrier intervening before Captain Tom Hamilton could
announce his acc-eptance of the proffered post as Athletic Di-

rector here.

Mo‘metary announcement. of his decision has been expected

“this Sunday.

4' Most pertinent rumor yes‘terda_v surrounding lTami1ton’s

request for retirement from the’

:_,U. S. Navy-——and his position as
"Athletic Director at the Naval
,_ ,gcademy——was that the Navy
ti"-".25 ‘ . ’ ‘
‘éiliight offer him the Naval Acad-
emy post on a civilian basis.
Due for Sea» Duty
Under_ the customary Navy “ro-
tation-of-duty” policy,’ Hamilton
gwould be transferred to sea duty
next year. More than 20 years of
_world travel as an active officer
of’ the Navy has tired the one-
time Navy football star.
" ~ “I’m convinced that my fu-
. ture is in athletics—either at the
,Naval Academy or at Pitt,” he
' disclosed Sunday.
11., Naval authorities, eager to re-
'~_,tain Hamilton, are reported to
shave been ready to offer him the
'7Ac_aderny’s athletic directorship on
‘ya civilian basis, thereby allowing
him to retire from the Navy.

May Bring Harmony

_There was some basis for this.
‘;_Only last year the head football
.""c,_oaching job was transferred
‘from a tour-of-duty job for a
i.;Navy_ officer to a civilian port-

folio. The change has been suit-
"jble fr_om most standpoints.
 Should Hamilton accept the Pitt
Iojb, a harmony and tranquillity
»-that hasn’t been seen in the ath-
.l_.etic setup here for over a decade
_m_ay pervade.
That Hamilton is an excellent
choice is found in the lack of any
Ijapposition to his appointment,
other than passive remarks by one
downtown sports writer, a former
_enlisted man, who is opposed to
'“brass." ~

Band to Revi\te Stadium iciblbr
With Review Next Wednesday

Football season is over but the band plays on.
For on Wednesday, Dec. 15 at 8:30 p. m., the 120—piece Varsity
Marching Band will present its second annual Stadium Review in

Soldiers and Sailors Memorial:

Hall.

The review, not to be construed
as a concert, will offer those who
followed the band at their Sat-
urday performances one last
chance to hear and see this well-
known organizatidn in action.

And to those who didn’t have
a chance to marvel, at the tricky
formations and matchless play-

ing of the musicians, Wednesday’s

Review will give the opportunity
to hear what they missed.

Robert L. Arthur will direct the
band in excerpts from all 1948
stadium formations. These will in-
clude everything from the Mex-
ican Hat Dance to a fast game of
patty-cake by the All-American
drum section.

More than 6000 Pittsburghers
toured the Cathedral of Learning
on Sunday as guests of the Uni-
versity at the first Open House in
its history.

Despite poor weather and com-
petition from the Pittsburgh
Steelers home grid ﬁnale and Vic-

tor de Sabata’s farewell perform- _

ance with the Pittsburgh Sym-
phony, the world’s tallest school-
house was jammed from 3 to 6
p. in.

Even before the official opening
time of 3 p. m. the walk leading
to the Fifth Avenue entrance of
the Cathedral was lined with
people waiting for the ‘doors to
open.

Once inside the building the
visitors were taken on tours of
the various floors and depart-
ments. Guests also were shown
through the Nationality Rooms.

The unﬁnished Croghan—Schen-
ley Room likewise was on dis-
play.

Student and faculty aides act-
ed as hosts and guides for the
afternoon. As they ﬁnished their
tours the guests were brought into
the Commons Room and intro-
duced to Chancellor Rufus H.
Fitzgerald. Punch was served in

the Commons Room.

organization. a
The play continues through
Saturday night. Curtain time is
8:30 p. m. Reserved seats are $1,
balcony unreserved seats 75 cents.
The play has never before been
performed in Pittsburgh.

Riding the wave of popular in-
terest in philosophy and its rela-
tion to life, the plays of Sartre
have achieved acclaim both here
and abroad. In “The Flies,” a
modern version of the Electra leg-
ends, the playwright
for his audience the workings and
operation of superstitution and
the accompanying mythology. -

‘ --Seek to Avenée-‘ 

 

Directed by Harvey J. Pope, the“. ,
play relates the story of E1ectra’s 

conniving with her brother Or-
estes to avenge their father’s
death at the hands of their moth-
er, the Queen and her lover,
Aegistheus.

With Ruth Schwartz as the trag-
ic Electra, Jack Ingram as her
brother Orestes, Dick Hazley as
King Aegistheus, Mary Lou
Crockett as Queen Clythemnestra,
and Jack Shano as the god Zeus,
the play rises through three acts
of mounting tension to an emo-
tional climax. '

Technically, this production of-
fers much that is new to Play-
ers’ audiences. - o

The scenery, for instance, like
the play itself is something of an
experiment. It is designed so that
it will be flexible enough to
change easily for various scenes.
Some of it will even revolve to
facilitate handling.

Costuming Difficult

Costumes, all Greek-style, have
presented somewhat of a problem.
Three weeks of dying, Cutting,
sewing and ﬁtting have gone in-
to the togas and other costumes
that will be used.. -

Because of the unusual lighting
effects necessary, plastic lighting
will be used for the ﬁrst time in
a Players production. The scenery
will be painted in neutral shades
and all coloring accomplished by
colored lights. A

Sartre is one of the leading ex-
ponents of the new philosophy of
Existentialism now popular in
Western Europe.

Several of his plays have been
produced on Broadway in recent
years. Most famous are‘ “No Ex-
it” and “The Respectable Prosti-
tute.” ’

Two colleges, Chicago Univer-
sity and Vasaar College, have
previously staged “The Flies."
Chicago acclaimed the play as the
outstanding production of that
university's dramatic season.

 MAN

There aren’t many men who could step into

a spot such as the Athletic Directorship at
Pitt with the widespread conﬁdence that Tom

: amilton will have when he comes here Feb. 1.
Everyone who has discussed the possibility

of his taking the job has expressed admiration

for his past work and conﬁdence that he will

be able to straighten out the ten-year athletic

. tangle here atthe University.

He comes unencumbered by any connection
with the various factions that have contribut-
ed to that tangle. Undoubtedly that was one of
the reasons for his selection. That, andia dis-
tinguished record as an athlete, a coach, an
athletic director, and an administrator.

With his appointment a lot of people who
have fretted about the University’s athletic
situation for a number of years can relax. -It’s
in good handsnow.

AWE NEED THEIR HELP

In spite of considerable competition from
professional football and the Pittsburgh Sym-

 phony Orchestra, Pitt ’s ﬁrst public Open House

was an greater success than even its most op-
timistic boosters predicted.

University officials “hoped” that 5000 peo-
ple would show up. Instead a crowd of more
than 6000 arrived, toured the Cathedral, and
met the Chancellor. ..

There ’s one simple conclusion that can be
drawn from the size of the turnout. That is
that Pittsburghers are interested in their Uni-
versity. The fact may come as a surprise to
many in the University. For Pitt and the peo-

' ple_ who direct it have nevertaken any trou- ~

ble to cultivate the friendship or interest of
the community.

Now, in the middle of a gigantic building
program, they are beginning to realize that
public supportvwill be necessary. And they are
realizing, too, that that support will come
only if the public is acquainted with the Uni-
versity and its work.

That Open House was a start in the right
direction. But it was only a start. What is
needed is a well planned, long range program
to bring the University before the public eye
and keep it there. I

Let the people of Pittsburgh know what
the University does andihow it contributes to
their lives and we will be able to count on
their cooperation. ‘

Heading this collection of rem-
nants is something or the other
about the Pitt Chest drive. It has
been brought to our attention that

some students really went generous

on the poor, unsuspecting committee
collecting dollars for the Chest.

Along with nickles and dimes
emptied from envelopes, bits of half-
eaten candy bars and paper clips
were prominent. In a pecuniary
sense, some students bent pretty
low, too. Frequently, two pennies (2
cents, that is) clinked from the red-
lettered envelopes.

The question is: where does stu-
pidity end and ignorance begin? But
then, it all may come under the
heading: ‘It’s a joke, son.’

vRound Two:

Two afternoons ago every door
and window of dear old Uni was
thrown open. Then peasants of the
community strolled in for a. view
of Pitt. I call these people pea-
nuts in University circles, for that

is how many of them feel, ac-
cording to comments passed this
way. I sympathize with these peo-
people and call their feeling of in-
feriority well-founded.’

As the University family knows,
a private open house took place
two Sundays ago. Somehow word
of this closed shindig was promi-
nently placed in the downtown pa-
pers. Feature of the article in
three Pittsburgh dailies was that
the a.ﬁ'air was ‘PRIVATE. Deep
down in the story-a notation read
that another open house for the
general public was scheduled the.
following Sunday. It's not that
we're class conscious. Or are we?

Next time, public relations peo-
ple of Pitt, place word of private
open-houses where it hurts least.
Old Russo-Japanese proverb: Few
dollars from many slobs equals
much money from one.

Pitt News may well earn title- of
‘the distinct cg the distinct.’ Twice

this year, it kept its inky ﬁngers 011.15
of the stuff ‘which busied many
newspapermen. First, there was the

business of predicting the winner of ‘

Forget The Past . \. .
Carver Keynofes
Afhlefic Fufure
Af Grid Banquet

By DONALD GIFFIN
Sports Editor

Frank Carver, given credit for
keeping Pitt’s athletic situation on
a relatively even. keel the past six
months, pointed toward the main-
tenance of athletic stability in the
future at the Varsity Lettermen’s
club banquet Wednesday night.

“Forget the past,” he said. Sim-
ple words, simple meaning, but
not a simple thing to accomplish.
When Tom Hamilton comes here
as athletic director, he will con-
stantly hear from various factions
connected with the University
what his predecessor, Jimmy Ha-
gan, did or-. did not do during his
long term at the sports helm. »

started. Bringing Captain Hamil- ’
ton here to head the whole show
will be another big step, even if
it is toward the East instead of
in the direction of the Midwest
and the Big Nine as some had
hoped.

A spirit of cooperation, evident
at the wel1—attended banquet, will
play a big part in the revival un-
der the new athletic director. Un-
hampered, free reins must ‘be
placed in his hands. If this is
done, Pitt athletic will ﬁt neatly

orite statement. --

Even government officials and

government.

The University operates a pub-

stitute of Local Government,
which provides non-political re-
search and advice, as well as fa-
cilities for the in-service training
of public officials.

Organized within the political
science department of the Uni-
versity, the institute is under the
direction of Dr. E. D. Graper,
head of the department. Assistant
professor William G. Willis serves
as Assistant Director and Miss
Annette Wekselman
assistant. «

The city of Pittsburgh and oth-

the service for. information and
suggestions on such matters as

A new book is in circulation en-
titled “Troy and Her Legend,” by
Dr. Arthur M. Young, of the

classics department at the Univer-
sity.

‘A number of years ago Pro-
fessor Semple of the University of
Cincinnati and Professor Blegen
planned an expedition to Troy to
start a new‘ excavation. Professor
Semple ﬁnanced the expedition
and Professor Blegen was in
charge of directing the excava-
tion.

Professors Semple and Blegen
worked on the practical end of the
excavations, and Dr. Young was
asked to do the literary work 0
the story.

The excavation was started in
1933, but was disrupted by the
war; therefore, it is not as yet
complete. Dr. Young, however,
was able to proceed with his work
here in the United States, and was
therefore able to complete the
book before the excavation was
completed. A

The publication of the archeol-
ogy of Troy has yet to~..be com-
pleted.

The book, says Dr. Young, is
probably the only one of its kind
in the ﬁeld of classics.

Usually the classicist stops with
his history, or legend, at the time

is research

of radio programs on government.
Colleges have asked for such
things as help in placing trainees

. in internship positions with local

government groups in this region,
and for advice on the giving of
courses on Pennsylvania local gov-
erment. A college in England re-
cently asked for information on
the government of the city of Pitts-
burgh.

Public clubs and business or-
ganizations ask for articles on the
electoral system and other aspects
of government, or for an apprais-
al of the constitution of their
club.

All these requests are complied
with—and this is only a part of
the institute’s activities. V

of the city of Pittsburgh is being
compiled after more than 100
personal interviews with city of-
ﬁcials and employees, in addition
to the study of innumerable re-
ports and statute books. A direc-
tory of local government officials
May. They will visit Bettysburg,
was published early this year.

The accumulation and classi-
ﬁcation of library research ma-
terials goes on continuously.
These materials are ﬁled in Room
2332 Cl., and borrowing cards
have been prepared for most of
the books and pamphlets. At least
50 students used the facilities for
work on specialized research
during the past year.

Another activity is the spon-
soring of conferences on current
municipal problems. On Oct. 17,
1947, 75 government officials at-
tended a conference at Pitt on
land subdivision control, and on
May 21, 1948, 80 attended a con-
ference on stream pollution. More
than 40 municipalities were rep-
resented at these-two conferences.
‘Proceedings of the stream pollu-
tionr conferences were published
and sent to interested parties.

The institute’s work also in-
cludes help in giving political
science courses on local and Penn-
sylvania government at Pitt. Many
local officials attend these evening
courses, and some are engaged as
special lect_urers.

‘Jolly Boys’i   
Say Panther  
Due Next Week

Beautiful women, sports fea-
tures, ladies sleeping apparel, and
an East Overshoe, Antartica, over-
seas page will highlight the “Jolly
Boy” issue of the Pitt Panther

next week, according to staff

members.

Not content to rest on their
laurels received by the record sell-
out of their last issue, the Panther
staff has gone “all out” to make
this issue even greater.

Instead of the usual single
Queen of Hearts, the Christmas
Panther will have twelve beau-
ties, each representing a month in
the year. To each will be attached
a calendar of the month she rep-
resents.

A highlight of the magazine will
be the Panther’s Over Seas Page.
This month the article will be
dedicated to the ardent readers
from East Overshoe, Antartica.

Due to the overwhelming ap-
proval of the Campus Candids
page, —the staff has decided to
make this a regular feature.

An article on the Panther bas-
ketball team written by Bob Mc-
Kowen covers Pitt basketball
from 1928 to the present. It also
contains a story of Doc Carlson's
eventful life in the world of
sports. _

'The fashion page will portray
the new bold look in ladies sleep-
ing apparel.

Two ﬁction stories, one serious

and one humorous, in addition to

all the other regular features, will
make this issue even better than
last Panther Editors believe.

Bgual ti Record of Graduates’

SHIRLEY LEVINE
_ and
PEGGY EVANS
In the world of science and pre-
cision that belongs to the School
of Nursing there is occassionally
a streak of the card player’s luck.
At Magee Hall, on Forbes

‘Street, the fashionable dormitory

for student nurses at Pitt, the
gambler would wrangle with fate
and place his odds on the luck
that seems inherent in the statis-
tical history of the school. There
have been 329 graduated since
the founding of the School of
Nursing 11 years ago. There are
37 nursing students in the “fresh-
man” class. The graduates have

-their own perfect-score success

story; the pre-clinical students

‘have the prerequisites for a new

story.

‘ That lucky. three and nine in the
total 329 might have been respon-
sible for a record that goes un-

challenged by any other group of

graduates throughout the coun-
try. At Pitt, vvhere_every nurse
must earn a bachelor of science
degree, and then pass a rigid state
examination before receiving her
Registered Nurse certiﬁcation, not
a girl among the total graduates
of 329 has ever failed the state ex-
am. This perfect score belongs
alone to Pitt, the youngest and
one of the best nursing schools in
the United States.

What about the pre—clinical stu-
dents? There’s that three again. In
the next three years, (each girl
has completed two years qf pre-

_ nursing), they will aim to become

R. N.’s, too.

Student nurseshave just receiv-
ed their uniform dresses and ap-
rons but will soon have earned
