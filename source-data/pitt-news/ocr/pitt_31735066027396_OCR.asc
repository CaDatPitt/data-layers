Lawyers battle each other in drug

Fraternity attorney says prosecutor threatene

Anthony Breznican

 

The attorneys may be the ones
in trouble with the law now in the
trial of a Pitt ﬁatemity member
charged with possessing drugs
with intent to sell them.

Stephen Begler, attorney for Pi
Lambda Phi brother, Robert Todd,
accused the assistant district attor-
ney of trying to suppress testimony
stating Todd was not a drug dealer.

The Assistant D.A., R. Bruce
Linsenmayer, refused comment.

Todd was arrested in an April
1996raidonthePiLambdaPhi
house and charged with “posses-
sion with intent to deliver” a num-
ber of drugs including marijauna,
heroin, and cocaine.

Also anested in the raid for
simple possession of marijauna
were six others: Lee Malkiel, Brian
Arpin, Kristopher Wregand, and
Micheal Kushner. Two girls,
Becky Budziszewski and Sandra
Flinchbaugh.

The four men admitted to pos-
sessing drugs Monday and were
put on probation. The women’s tri-
als are still pending.

Yesterday Budziszewski testi-
ﬁed in Judge Jeffrey A. Manning’s
courtroom that Linsenmayer
threatened to revoke any “deal” the
D.A.’s ofﬁce might strike with her
if she testiﬁes in favor of Todd. She
could not comment about the
speciﬁcs of the bargain.

  

“You can’t coerce a person’s
testimony by threatening them
with the big lead boot of govern-
ment,” said Begler. ~

Begler plans to ﬁle a motion to
have the case dismissed because of
the D.A.’s actions.

Ironically, during pretrial hear-
ings to suppress evidence,
Linsenmayer accused defense
attorneys Begler, Kevin
McNicho1as, and Avery Abrams of
tampering with a witness.

The three attorneys’
approached the police informant in
the courtroom before her testimo-
ny, at which time Linsenmayer
shouted for them to “get away
ﬁorn her!”

Linsenmayer said he thought
theyweretryingtocoereeher, and
asked the Judge to bar them from
talking to the informant.

“We werejust trying to talkto
her,” McNicho1as said. “We could
talk to whoever we want to.”

Begler said, “We ﬁgured, it’s
their business if they want to talk to
us.”

Linsenmayer would not com-
ment about whether he plarmed to
ﬁle a complaint against the attor-
neys.

But Begler was vocal about
the trouble he thought
Linsenmayer would face from
Judge Manning. “When a judge
tells a lawyer to get another lawyer,
you can be sure you have a prob-
lem,” Begler said.

- Mayor Tom Murphy
talked about campaign poli-
tics, the past, and his hopes for
Pittsburgh’s future yesterday
in his downtown ofﬁce.

Murphy entered his term
with three speciﬁc goals in
mind: He wanted to reduce the
crime rate, tackle a rocketing
city budget, and grab the atten-
tion of developing industries
and get them to set up in
Pittsburgh.

Nearing the end of this
term, he says he’s three for
three.

Murphy said the platform
for the upcoming mayoral race
is simple. He’s vowed to con-
tinue to add «value to the city of
Pittsburgh and build the
“foundation [he] has laid in the
city.”

Crtmch time on crime

Murphy said his adrninis-
tration has emphasized “an
aggressive law enforcement
strategy.”

“Any crime is too much,”
said Murphy as he sat in his
downtown ofﬁce yesterday.
His face held a look of concern
when he discussed the matter,
but he smiled as he spoke of
the police improvements of
the past several years.

He said he had restruc-
tured the police department
signiﬁcantly since he’s come
into office. In doing so, he has
also restructured the depart-
ment’s leadership.

And for each year of
Murphy’s term, the crime rate
has gone down in Pittsburgh,
falling this year to its lowest in
nearly 30 years, according to
the Pittsburgh Police Bureau.

“Our decreases in crime
are among the largest decreas-

 

Mayor Tom Murphy outlines
his reelection platform.

es in the nation,” said Murphy.
He cited statistics, saying that
Pittsburgh’s decrease in crime
was 3 to 4 times the national
average rate.

Murphy paused from
squeezing the small green
stress ball he held in his hand
and said he will make sure that
trend continues.

In Pittsburgh’s proposed
operating budget for 1997,
Murphy’s ofﬁce has indicated
that its goals for the Pittsburgh
Police are to decentralize man-
agement policies and reduce
costs.

And it’s these reduced
costs that Murphy said have
been a major part of clipping
the rocketing city budget he
faced coming into ofﬁce in
1993. -
Budgeting the ‘Burgh

Murphy’s proposed gen-
eral fund budget for 1997 is
$312,530,136. That ﬁgure is
2.8 percent, or $8,989,489,
less than this year’s budget.

When he ﬁrst sat down at
the enormous desk in the City
County building, Murphy
faced a nearly $50 million
deﬁcit.

VATICAN CITY —— Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with
Pope John Paul II at the Vatican on
Monday. While he was there,
Netanyahu asked the pontiff again to
come and make a pilgrimage to the
Holy Land of Jerusalem as soon as he
can. “We look forward to receiving you
in Jerusalem,” Netanyahu said to the
pope, to which the pope responded,

. “God bless Israel.”

While they met, the two men dis-
cussed the status of Jerusalem and the
progress of Middle East peace efforts.
The most delicate issue in the Middle
East peace talks is Jerusalem, and the
pope expressed a desire for it to become
an “open city” to which anyone can
make a pilgrimage. Associated Press

Goodbye, Choice Dollars
— hello, CampusFunds

New meal plan allows purchase of non-food items

.e9B° F

 

Students who use Choice Dollars on
their PittCards will ﬁnd themselves using
some new meal plan programs in the fall.

At the end of April, the Choice Dollars
program will be replaced by CampusFunds.
Students will still be able to put money on
their.PittCards to buy food olf-campus, but
the new program will give them the ability to
purchase other items.

A number of local businesses are
already signed up with the CampusFunds
program, according to Lynell Scafr", director
of auxiliary budget and ﬁnance and the Pitt
ID Center.

Scaﬂ said most places that currently
accept Choice Dollars don’t want two sepa-
rate card-scanning terminals for the two sep-
arate programs. When CampusFunds frilly
replaces Choice Dollars, vendors will not
have to worry about that problem anymore.

“We want to make the CampusFunds
program as big and as successful as we can,”
said Scalf. “In the process, we want to make
sine that the program is student-ﬁiendly and
convenient for students.”

In addition to outside vendors, students
will be able to purchase items from vending
machines or pay for their latmdry with
CampusFunds. The machines will be ﬁtted

to read the PittCard’s magnetic strip as soon _

as August

“Everything will be on one card,” Scaﬂ’
said. “Students will be able to purchase food
products, buy books, or groceries, or some
new clothes, or compact discs, or get a soda
out of the vending machines, and do their
laundry.”

When students sign up for
CampusFunds, they must prepay the
amount they want to put on their cards. With
Choice Dollars, students are required to ﬁll
out a form for the amount they want, and the
bill is sent home. -

Scaff also said that the amount ‘deposit-
ed into CampusFunds will remain on the
PittCard until it is entirely spent, or until the
student graduates.

“CampusFunds carry over ﬁom semes-
ter to semester, and ﬁorn year to year,” she
said. “If the student transfers or graduates
and has more than $10 in CampusFunds, we
will gladly refund their money.”

Scatf said that students will not be able
to purchase tobacco or alcohol with
CampusFunds.

“This is not an age-discriminatory
action,” she said. “Students, staff, and facul-
ty will be able to purchase CampusFunds,
but no one will be able to ptuchase tobacco
or alcoho .”

Some of the current businesses that
Scatf said use CampusFunds include Video
One, Pamela’s, Uncle Sarn’s, the Original
Hot Dog Shop, Domino’s, Giant Eagle, CJ

 

Bamey’s, Oakland Fashion Optical, Wheel
Deliver, Going Greek, The Campus
Bookstore, Packages Plus, and The Pitt
Shop. ‘ i

The CampusFunds program is expand-
ing and is open to any businesses in
Oakland, Shadyside, and Squirrel Hill that
want to participate.

But back on campus, Pitt’s meal plan
system is also facing some proposed
changes for the near future.

Betsy Salade-Farina, the director of
food services, is meeting with the adrninis—
tration tonight to discuss the campus meal
plan’s future. .

Campus oﬂicials have made a proposal
to reduce the amormt of blocks a student is
required to buy, and suggested the imple-
mentation of a supplement to the block sys-
tem known as “Dining 

Thesecanbeusedtomakeapurchase
on campus that doesnot constitute a b1ock’s

dent goes over a block by several cents.

“The ‘Dining Dollars’ program is tar- .

geted towards students who make smaller
purchases,” Salade-Farina said “It will mir-
ror the former Choice Dollars program, but
the ‘Dining Dollars’ can be used only on

Student Government Board Member
Ryan Weidenmiller, thinks the Choice
Dollars program should stay. He said that
Can1pusFunds could be used to purchase
non—food items, and Choice Dollars could
remain speciﬁcally for food purchases.

Weidenmiller is concerned that parents
familiar with the Choice Dollars program
will give money to students, thinking that
Campus Funds are the same thing.

A “Parents will be thinking that the money
that they give their children will go only to
the purchase of food, while the student has
the option of spending it on anything ﬁorn
clothes to CDs, as well as food,”
Weidenmiller said.

He said that the students he had spoken
with at the recent SGB town hall meeting
and those who had stopped into the SGB
ofﬁoe generally wanted to keep the Choice
Dollars program.

On Monday, Weidenrrriller sent out a
letter to American Express, which runs the
CampusFunds program.

The letter informed American Express
of the student consensus he found that want-
ed to keep Choice Dollars, and asked them
to reconsider cutting the program.

He is encouraging students to address
the administration with their questions and
concerns about the program changes.

Scaff said that anyone who has any
questions or suggestions about
CampusFunds may call the ID Center in
McCormick Hall at 6247632.

During the past decade, Pitt students have won more of the prestigious

Rhodes and Marshall Scholarships than any other college or university in
Pennsylvania. Pitt ranks ﬁfth nationwide in this category when compared
with other state—supported institutions.

Probation

A. Manning sentenced the four to probation
without verdict, with Malkiel and Kushner get-
ting 90 days, and Arpin and VVregand getting 30

  

. days. Todd’s case has not ended yet.

“All ‘probation without verdict means’ is
that they have to stay out of trouble, stay off of
drugs, and when their probation is over, their
record is clean because they weren’t technically
convicted,” said Stephen Begler, Todd’s attor-
ney. “My client is facing more serious charges,
and we don’t want him to do any jail time, so
we’re going to keep ﬁghting for him.”

Though the punishment is light, Malkiel’s
and Wiegand’s attorney, Kevin McNicholas, still
criticized the arrest, saying the police wanant did
not permit them to search his clients.

‘The police had a warrant for one room,
and they searched the whole place,” said
McNicholas. “Only one person was nanred, but
theytoretheentirehouseapartarrdsearched
everyone.”

One of the arresting ofﬁcers, Detective
Daniel Yocca, said the anests were made
because it was clear the brothers had drugs.

“We can’t just haul one guy into court and
tell thejudge, ‘We let the others go because they
didn’t have that much [marijuana] on them, and
they seemed like nice boys,”’ he said “We have
to be fair.”

Even so, Arpin’s and Kushner’s attorney,
Avery Abrams, said Judge Kathleen Durkins
should never have let the evidence into court.
Durkins presided over a separate evidence hear-
mg.

“The cops should have played by the rules,
but if they’d done that, they wouldn’t have any
evidence in the ﬁrst place,” said Abrams. “It was
a poor job of policing and a poor job of inter-
preting the Constitution.”

Durkins’ rulingcarneafterthreedays of tes-
timony from the defense to suppress the evi-
dence turned up by the wanant.

The defense said the warrant was invalid
because it speciﬁed only one particular room in
the house in which no drugs were found. They

also argued that the infomiant, whose testimony
supported the wanant, was unreliable.

. The informant was a Pitt student arrested by
Detective Duﬁ'y for possession of psilocybin
mushrooms in March. In exchange for the lesser
charge of “disorderly conduct,” the girl told
police she would help them investigate others.

“I said to her ‘You help me out, and I’ll help
you out,’” Duﬂ°y testiﬁed.

City police requested that the informant’s
name be left out ofthe media because of possi-
ble repercussions on her and other investigations.

Tofulﬁllherpartofthebargain,theinfor-
mant made the controlled purchase of heroin
from Todd. Dutfy said he provided the infomiant
with $30ofmarkedmoneytornakethebuyand

Todd’s wallet with nea1'ly $1000 in cash.

“At that time we had reason to believe
RobertTodd’sbedroomwas locatedonthe third

room, we found that wasn’t the case.”

Todd was supposed to move from the sec-

“Sotheroomyoufoundthedrugsinwas

asked Begler.

“No,” Duify responded, but he went on to
saythewarrantwasstillusablebecauseitalso
speciﬁed that the police could search Todd’s
room, wherever it might be.

“The second ﬂoor room was clearly his,”
Duffy said. “Todd had not yet moved.”

Duffy’s informant complicated matters

 

even more a few months after the raid by sign-
ing an affidavit under oath which stated she was
not the informant, and that she did not purchase
drugs from Todd.

In the statement, the informant said she
smuggled the heroin into the frathouse by hiding
it in her vagina, and once inside she removed the
heroin and told Duffy that she purchased it ﬁom
Todd.

Assistant District Attorney R. Bruce
Linsenrnayer had to subpoena her to refute that
document during the pretrial hearing or risk loos-
ing the evidence produced by the wanant.

“We have reason to believe that [the infor-
mant] was coerced and pressured to change her
story and that the affidavit is bogus,”
Linsenrnayer said.

Clearly upset, the tearful informant testiﬁed
that she did indeed purchase the drugs and only
signedthedocumentbecauseofpressurefrom
her friends and a private investigator hired by the
defense attorneys.

She said the investigator came to her six or
seven times with the document, “ but he kept
coming back and calling.”

“There were also my ﬁiends, people I go to
school with,” she said. “Everyone I knew was
tellingrneto ‘signthepapersifyou’renota

But after signing the papers, the infomrant
met with Duffy and told him she never bought
the drugs from Todd. The informant testiﬁed in

from Todd.

“You’ve told so many people so many dif-
ferent stories. How is [Judge Durkins] supposed
to believe anything you say?" Begler asked the
infomiant.

Dutfy said he was still sure she bought the
drugs from Todd because he felt he’d searched
her thoroughly before sending her into the frat.
But under cross-exarnination, Dutfy admitted he
hadn’t searched her body cavities.

But Duffy said a remark Todd made during
an interview indicated he’d sold drugs to the
informant.

“During the course of the questioning,
[Todd] would listen quietly for a while then go
off on a tangent saying ‘Who turned me in?’
Then he said ‘I know; I sold some broad a bag of
dope this weekend!” Duﬁy said.

Begler tried to further discredited the infor-
mant by asking how many drugs she was on dur-
ing the time of the raid. The informant admitted
an addiction to cocaine and heroin during that
time.

“Did you know [the infomrant] was addict-
edtococaineandheroinduringthetimeofthe
controlled buy?” Begler asked.

“No, not heroin,” Duﬁy responded. “She
said she had used cocaine.”

This mountain of inﬂammatory testimony
failed to persuade the judge, however. Durkins
ruledthatthewarrantwasvalidandadmittedall
the evidence it produced into the criminal trial.

Begler called the infor'mant’s testimony “an
agreement with the DA. to commit perjury,”
and said even the anesting oﬂicers told him they
were surprised by the verdict.

“We should have won the suppression, but

the four fraternity brothers came to an end in

McNicholas said they weren’t happy with

had we wanted to appeal, I believe we would
have won,” said McNicholas. “But that would

growth and development of companies
within the city. The administration has
also cut back by allowing certain posi-
tions within the city to remain unﬁlled
after vacancies occur.

“We are tough, honest city budget
managers,” said Murphy.

He walked away from the charts in
front of his desk and sat down in an
upholstered chair, leaning forward.

“The single most [common] thing I
hear about is that we have to create jobs in
Pittsburgh,” he said firmly, with a tinge of
frustration in his voice. “And I’ve been
working closely with the business com-
munity in Pittsburgh to do that.”

But he explained the situation as sort
of a catch 22.

What the public sees, said Murphy, is
that 1,100 city jobs have been cut. That
ﬁgure was highlighted by the recent elim-
ination of funding for 145 ﬁreﬁghters’
jobs by City Council member Bob
O’Connor’s open opposition to the move.

Murphy said that many people prob-
ably don’t realize granting the funding for
those jobs doesn’t mean they will be
ﬁlled. Instead, he said, the money comes
out of the pockets of local residents and
waits.

“It’s the difference between leader-
ship and playing to the crowd,” Murphy
said ﬁrmly. He placed his hands together,
and his eyes narrowed as he explained
how he plans to cut the deﬁcit and still get
jobs.

“I’m not raising taxes,” said Murphy.
“And we’ve cut costs on all our public
services.” Shrugging his shoulders and
raising his hands, he said, “Attacking the
cuts is a classic example of grandstand-
mg.”

Murphy said he won’t pay for grand-
standing from the city’s pocket.
Getting the city to work

So to‘ answer the problem, Murphy
has launched an all-out effort to bring
business to Pittsburgh, not to turn
Pittsburgh into a business.

The mayoral ofﬁce’s budget report
conﬁrms Murphy’s statement that over
the past year businesses have made the
choice to develop in Pittsburgh. Incoming
businesses invested over $600 million this
past ﬁscal year alone.

“The only way the city succeeds is if
the region expands and succeeds,” said
Murphy.

Murphy said by turning Pittsburgh’s
unused “white elephants” into productive,
thriving areas of growth, the city has and
will continue to increase its income to fill
the gap that is left behind by not increas-
ing taxes.

“Take Jones and Laughlin site for
example,” said Murphy  he thrust him-
self from his chair and walked over to a
series of display plans. ‘‘It is a living
image of our new Pittsburgh.”

He showed plans that depicted the

 FROM PAGE I 

area where construction will begin this
summer for the l5—light industry build-
ings, the 26—acre riverfront park, and
many general improvements along the
Carson Street area.

He paced between some of the plans
propped up in the middle of the ﬂoor and
explained them. He predicted each would
have remarkable results.

Some plans were just that —— plans.
Many are still in the negotiation stage.
Others will begin soon or have just
recently begun. Murphy said that every
one of them will draw more businesses,
more money, and more jobs into the city.

“This,” he said with a slight smile on
his face, “is how we add value to
Pittsburgh.”

Time to play ball?

And then there’s the question of sta-
diums.

On the coffee table, in front of him,
sat a pitcher ﬁlled with 5 baseballs.
Murphy said he loves Pittsburgh’s teams.
But the look of ease fell from his face
when the topic arose.

“A fact of life is that in ﬁve years
there will not be a major league team in
Pittsburgh, unless we work with these
teams to be competitive,” he said.

And he made it clear that none of the
money from the city’s wage, property, or
business privilege tax will be taken and
used to fund a new stadium.

Instead, Murphy said he wants to get
that money from tourist supported busi-
nesses in the fonn of hotel taxes, for
example.

“When [the Steelers] lost the playolf
game against New England, the city also
lost about 10 million dollars,” he said.

Murphy said that he doesn’t want to
see the teams go under, but he won’t just
give them city money.

“The bigger issue here is to think
about the city,” said Murphy, shifting in
his seat and resting his folded hands on
his knee.

He said his faith, once again, lies in
making the city grow and reaping the
money from it.

“It’s not about ballparks and stadi-
ums. It’s about whether or not we believe
in ourselves.” ‘

The cards of party politics

Behind his desk hangs a print of John
F. Kennedy. But Murphy says he doesn’t
have the time in his 15 hour days to play
the cards of party politics.

It is not certain whether the
Democratic party will give Murphy their
endorsement for next term.

“I would like to have the endorse-
ment,” said Murphy, reclining for the ﬁrst
time during the hour in his chair. But he
said he has run without the party’s
endorsement before. and he’s won. He
says he could do it again.

Wrapping up the interview, he stood
up to shake hands and pack up the plans
and displays he had set out.

“Next term,” said Murphy, “is to
build on the foundation laid.”

Pick your partywith care for the primary’s sake

Pennsylvania is a closed pri-
mary state. What this means is
that you can only vote in the pri-
mary for the political party in
which you are registered.

Closed primaries are a great
part of the political system in that
they keep voters quasi-ethical. In
states with open primaries, those
states in which you can vote in
whichever party’s primary you
would like, often face the prob-
lem of voters who are registered
with one party storming the polls
of the other party. What this
means is: say Candidate X is a
sure thing to win the Republican
primary. So, a large number of

Republican voters vote in the
Democratic primary for the weak-
est candidate, Candidate Y, who is
the most likely to be beaten by
Candidate X. This destroys the
competition between the parties.
If you are going to register
with a particular party, then, you
should feel at least some loyalty

' to and afﬁliation with that party.

Primaries are the opportunity to
make sure that the best candidate
from your party is on the ballot in
the general election. A Democrat
should be concerned with having
a good Democratic candidate on

 

the ballot, and a Republican
should want a good Republican
candidate on the ballot. Once the
Democrats have chosen their can-
didate and the Republicans have
chosen theirs, then you have the
opportunity to cross party lines.
Those Democrats who didn’t like
Bill Clinton had the opportunity
to vote for another Democratic
candidate in the primary and then
to vote for Bob Dole in the gener-
al election if they so desired.

I That’s the way the system works,

and thought it may not be perfect,
it is the best that we have.

Get out there and register to
vote. Pick your party with care. A
party affiliationqis something that
should be thought over extensive-
ly. Don’t register with a party
simply because it’s the one your
parents favor, your boyfriend
thinks is best, or a TV commer-
cial told you to. Choose it
because it means something to
you and because you think it will
yield the best candidates for
ofﬁce. If you already have a party
afﬁliation but wish to change it,
all you have to do is re—register.
Political parties are the backbone
of our system. Take yours seri-
ously.

“Are you high?” just about
sums up the level of argument on
the question of legalizing mari-
juana for medicinal purposes.
Meanwhile, back at the ranch,
people make their own choices
regardless of the doctors and
lawyers. In my view, marijuana
should not be illegal because the
application of law to a user caus-
es more harm than the drug does,
not to mention that it’s a waste of
public money. But I’m not going
to rehash (pun intended) all the
arguments here; everyone can
ﬁnd reasons to support their own
beliefs. Instead, this column will
present a brief review of current
facts. which are known, or not
known, about this drug.

Marijuana, as a matter of
fact, is not a drug. According to
my sources, the word “marijua-
na” refers solely to the plant
material which contains over
400 different materials. Of these
materials, delta-9-tetrahydro-
carmabinol (THC) is a major
psychoactive chemical. THC is
absorbed quickly into virtually
every bodily tissue. Research has
shown that THC alters almost -all
biological systems in which it
has been examined, having a
“non-speciﬁc, ﬂuidizing effect
on membranes” —— yes mem-
branes, not memory, although
perhaps there is a connection
there. Research has shown that
THC has both contradictory and
inconsistent effects — for exam-
ple, both exciting and inhibiting
the release of various neurotrans-
mitters, and having sedative
effects without producing anes-
thesia. In addition to the “hard
science” (chemistry, physics) of

 

THC, “soft science” (psycholo-
gy, sociology) shows that the
effects of THC as reported by
users indicate that the cultural
milieu in which the drug is
ingested changes the reported
effects. - For example, North
American users commonly
report appetite stimulation; in
fact, this is one of the key rea-
sons of the “For Medical Use”
argument. Conversely, in
Jamaica, users report appetite
suppression.

Recognizing such cultural
differences is important to
putting THC in the right perspec-
tive; however, North American
research over the past several
years has yielded the following
gems: dose dependent impair-
ment of functions such as attend-
ing, speaking, problem solving,
and concept formation. This
means that a roomful of stoners
is likely to be a room full of peo-
ple all talking at cross purposes,
hardly able to remember what
the points of their sentences are
from begimiing to end, and mak-
ing profound connections they
are incapable of communicating
to one another. Well, it seemed
like fun at the time.

Apparently, it is only the
human race who enjoys the
effects of THC. It is universally
disliked by non-humans.
Neuroscientists refer to “tran-
sient cognitive and memory ‘dis-
ruptions.” This means, it feels
like somebody cut off the top of
your head, and your thoughts
rush out to mingle with the
world, while the world rushes in
to mingle with your thoughts.
Animals, sensible creatures, ﬁnd
this distracts them too much
from such important topics as “I

Pundit goes up in a puff of smoke

must ‘protect myself from preda-
tors.” Humans seem to like for-
getting about predators for a
while if they are in a position to
control their enviromnent, we
might conclude.

Despite such precautions as
a controlled environment, the
concentration of THC in any
given batch of marijuana varies
greatly. Acute panic reaction can
set in when dose is unusually
high. This is not usually fatal,
although it can be very scary at
the time and very embarrassing
afterwards. Far more ominous in
a long-terrn sense is the knowl-
edge that THC quite deﬁnitely
messes with memory storage and
retrieval. Nobody knows much
about this yet, but everyone
knows Alzheimers isn’t pretty.
Everybody also knows smoke is
not good for your lungs.

So, if you are high, just
remember, there’s no smoke
without ﬁre, and animals are
more sensible than humans. But,
such is life. If the effects of THC
are inconsistent and contradicto-

ry, well, maybe that’s why we '

like it: it’s just like us. I hope I
never need my doctor to pre-

scribe me marijuana to ease the

pain of some dreadful disease
and its worse treatment, but it
would be nice to know I could if
I had to. But either way, if I want
it, I’ll get it. There is no evidence
to suggest that THC interferes
with such qualities as ingenuity,
resourcefulness, and determina-
tion. Then again, I don’t think
anybody has looked into those
yet.

Wednesday, February 5, ‘I997

 

Last Sunday, I was eating breakfast
and reading my copy of The Post-
Gazette, when I came across an article
about a speech that Speaker of the House
Newt Gingrich made the previous day to
constituents of his Georgia Congressional
District. Gingrich, who was ﬁned and

reprimanded by the House of
Representatives for ethics violations, had
apparently decided to take back the apol-
ogy he had given weeks earlier and
blame that old right-wing standby for his
woes: that evil cabal of liberal journalists
who gather together at night to plot ways
to inﬂict their elitist, counterculture agen-
daupon theAmerican people andtotat-
ter the reputation of ﬁne, upstanding
Republicans. Well, Newt had something
to say to them.

“Somehow, if you’re on the left, you
can co-mingle with everything, and no
one seems to notice,” Gingrich said in a
speech that mixed self-pity with anger. “If
you are a conservative, and you hue a
lawyer, and you make a mistake, you had
better prepare to be pilloried. It’s a sub-
stantial double standard that is consistent-
ly repeated”

Please

Gingrich has to admit that he has
only himself to blame. Gingrich became

THE PITT NEWS

Newt, you have no one to blame for ethics woes but yourself

Speaker of the House two years ago,
grandly talking about “the sweep of his-
tory” and how he would magically trans-
form the government. Instead, his arro-
gance and belief that his way was the
only way led him to believe that he could
get away with anything, whether that be
gutting the medicare or turning his tax-
exempt, “non-partisan” teaching course
at a Georgia college into a way of ﬂog-
ging the Republican agenda. In his
speech, that he gave before Congress
upon getting re-elected as Speaker,
Gingrich humbly apologized and asked
his colleagues for forgiveness. Now it is
clear that he has learned nothing, and his
word is worthless.

Gingrich was correct about one
thing, though There is a double standard,
and Gingrich beneﬁtted from it. When
Jim Wright was Speaker of the House,
Gingrich attacked him like a rabid dog for
his ethical transgressions until Wright
resigned ﬁom Congress. Now Gingrich
is insisting upon holding onto all of his ill-
gottengainsatanycost.Thepursuitof
power has left Gingrich a man without
dignity. Itis tirneforhimtogo.

A USA Today/CNN poll, taken a few
weeks ago, revealed that by a 65 to 23
percent margin, the American people feel
that Gingrich should step down as
Speaker of the House (the public was

mostly split on whether or not he should
resign from Congress altogether). What
must be especially troubling is that while
a vast majority of Democrats support
Gingrich’s removal from power, three out
of four independent voters and even a
majority of Republican voters (51 to 39
percent) want Gingrich to step down
from the Speaker’s chair. The poll went
on to ask voters who has higher ethical
standards — Gingrich or President
Clinton? I’m sure that the result likely
gave Republican leaders who despise
President Clinton a heart attack By a
nearly two-toone margin, the American
people said President Clinton had better
ethics. For two years, Gingrich has been
a symbol of everything that is wrong with
American politics: the greed, the conup-
tion, and the arrogance. ‘ *

There is a growing sentiment among
Republicans that Gingrich is ﬁnished as
the leader of the Republican party’s “rev-
olution.” GOP Congressman Peter King
is sick of Gingrich whining about his
troubles: “Heneedstobe smartenoughto
realizethathe’s gottoendthis. Heneeds
to stoptalking aboutwhathappenedand

_n1ove on.” Nine Republican congress-
men had the courage to oppose
Gingrich’s re-election as Speaker, despite
threatened reprisals. Congresswoman

p Linda Smith of Washington attended a

meeting of the Republican leadership and
was told that if she didn’t support
Gingrich, she’d be considered “disloyal
and not in the family.” Naturally,
Congresswoman Smith was promptly
punished for her display of conscience
after she voted for an alternate candidate
for Speaker, and was stripped of her
chairmanship of a congressional subcom-
mittee. During his many years as a back-
benching congressman, Gingrich lam-
basted Democrats in power for being
tyrants. Who’s the tyrant now? I

The mandate of the 1996 election ‘

seemed to be that voters were sick of par-
tisanship and wanted to preserve the sta-
tus quo. Accordingly, neither the
Republican nor the Democratic parties
have a particularly ambitious legislative
agenda planned for 1997. Unfortunately,
both parties, in the absence of an agenda,
have turned their attention to assailing the
ethical standards of their counterparts. To
the typical observer, the partisan snipping
may look petty and childish, but there are
old wounds and grudges between the two
sidesthatarenotlikelytohealanytime
soon. I think that Gingrich’s resignation
would go a long way towards healing the
wounds of the last two years.

Michael Berquist is beginning to tire of
all of the yelling and screaming about
ethics.

Amltheonlyonewhothinksthat
the concept of atﬁrmative action has
been misused? ‘

Recent U.S. Supreme Court deci-
sions, plus the passage of the California
Civil Rights Initiative back in
November, have suggested to some that
civilrightsgainsmadeinthe1960sare
now in danger.

I’m not so sure.

We all know that Aﬂirmative Action
programs were originally designed to
grant educational and vocational oppor-
tunities to deserving minorities and
women» who had fonnerly been “locked
out” due to law or custom. The intention
was for such people to build relation-
ships with those in power, to become
part of the so-called “old-boy” network
No one, except perhaps hard-core
racists, would disagree with that policy.

However, thanks to unscrupulous
civil rights leaders more concemed with
maintaining and expanding their own
power, the very concept has become a
synonym for reverse racism. To them,
“equal opportunity” stands for “equal
results” and “proportional representa-
tion,” the means becoming subject to the
ends. The consequences have been
downright devastating.

I remember a 1989 article in
Fortune magazine called “The New

We av 

Racism on Campus” by black conserva-
tive economist Thomas Sowell (with
whom I usually don’t agree). His
premise was that “preoccupation with
racial body-count” helped to inﬂame
racial tensions at colleges and universi-
ties, only a few of them in the South. For
example, when blacks with high school
grades and SAT scores lower than the
student body as a whole were admitted
under what some people would call a
“quota system” and then struggled in the
classroom, blacks complained about
racismandthusarousedtheireofwhite
students. .

I’ve actually witnessed what S
was talking about 

When I ﬁrst arrived
on the Georgia Tech

11

 
 

Later that fall I attended a meeting
black students had set up with Tech’s
administration, and it consisted almost
entirely of students complaining about
the university’s racism One woman
stood up and accused the president of
“taking the federal funds and ﬂunldng
out the black students.” Needless to say,
that kind of attitude, prevalent in that day,
didn’t endear blacks to the rest of the stu-
dent body. When the Afro-American
Association’s intramural football team
was crushed in the playoff ﬁnals, almost
the entire campus cheered.

On the other hand, you might make

f otas in hiring, promotions,
and contract bids. Right
or wrong, many blacks

while visiting a fraternity without afﬁrrnative

the cumulative grade— decisions often are based

point averages of every
Greek organization.
Omega Psi Phi, the only
black fratemity on cam-
pus at the time, was last
with a 2.0. That was the average, which
meant that a signiﬁcant number of broth-
ers were in serious academic trouble
(Sowell had said he noticed two decades
before that half of the black students at
Cornell were on probation.)

 

not on qualiﬁcations but
contacts (the old adage
“it’s not what you know
but who[m] you know”).

I.et’s take the Supreme
Court decision Adarand v. Pehes which
concerned a minority ﬁrm in Colorado
that was awarded a government contract
despite not submitting the lowest bid (the
court had declared that unconstitutional).
While I can’t prove this, here’s my guess

ulous civil rights leaders to thank for reverse racism

as to why minority-owned companies
have to charge more for such services:
They tend to be newer, smaller, and sad-
dled with much more debt (e.g., out-
standing bank loans) than, and thus can-
not immediately compete with, those
companies with white male owners. In
order to level the playing ﬁeld, we may
need some type of temporary “quota sys-
tem;” once minority-owned companies
become established, the “preferences”
can go. ,

My budding career as a journalist is

- an example as to how aﬂirmative action

should work Last summer, I did my
required internship with the Pittsburgh
Post-Gazette and stand an excellent
chance of getting a job in that ﬁeld, if not
that paper. Afﬁrrnative Action? Probably.
However, I’ve maintained a portfolio for
13 years and a 3.83 GPA in my journal-
ism courses, not to mention a 20-year
acquaintance with former P-G Senior
Editor Clarke Thomas. I got on the radio
the same way — yes, it had to do with
my being black, but people knew what I
could do, and they gave me a chance.
Affirmative Action can only work
when people’s opportunities are
matched to their skills and expertise.
That’s justice. But is that what we’re
looking for?
Rick Nowlin believes that everyone has a
constitutional right to make an idiot of
himself —- but doesn’t recommend it.

 

 

Just what are
the Buccos
thinking?

 

Baseball fans, the solution is here.

Straight from the wise men at the
top of Three Rivers, the officials of the
Pittsburgh Pirates have ﬁgured out how
to save their franchise from its worst
season since, well, last season.

Red.

Yep, red. Not free agents, not
reduced ticket prices, just red. ,

Red hats. Red bandanas. Red ﬂags.
All to avoid running into red ink by the
All-Star break.

So far, it’s working. PirateFest
broke records this year. Merchandising
is up 350 percent, according to the
Pirate organization. This past weekend,
over 14,000 tickets were sold to week-
end games throughout the season.

That’s nice. Now, how long will
the lovefest continue once the season
starts?

Pittsburghihas invited 70 players to ,

spring training, including the non-ros-
ter talents of Joe Boever and Dale
Sveum. The 40-man roster is stacked
with seven infielders, led by the irre-
pressible Kevin Elster. Al Martin leads
the outfield, and the pitching staff is
anchored by the Latin-Alphabet—Soup
combo of Francisco Cordova (4.09
ERA last year) and Estaban Loaiza
(4.96 ERA).

Take out Martin and catcher Jason
Kendall, and that squad has as much
appeal as the Kellii Taylor Shooting
Clinic.

Pirate management doesn’t con-
cem itself with these trivial facts. The
team’s business is breaking winter
records, and that's all that matters. A
least, for now. _ '

Bruce o Panther from day one

‘Patrick Robertson

 

Kirk Bruce started

University of Pittsburgh in 1971.
He has been with the school in
many capacities since then, includ-
ing his head coaching position of

today.

. He started as a basketball play-
er between 1971-1975. He played
on the 1974 team which finished
25-4. As a senior, Bruce led the
team with 17.1 points per game in
1974-75. He went on to become a
men’s assistant coach at Pitt for‘
one year after graduation. He was
also an assistant coach for the
Clairton High School team from
1975-80. He then took over the
head coaching job from 1981-84.

After his stint in Clairton, he
returned to Pitt as a women’s assis-
tant for one year before taking over
the duties as the head man. He has era of
held that position for 12 years now,
and he does not plan on giving it
up anytime soon. Adding to his
resume, he coached the South team
at the U.S. Olympic festival two

 

years ago.

He has an overall record of
144-171 as the women’s head
coach. That includes five winning
seasons. .

Bruce thinks a great deal of
family and loyalty. Today, he lives
one block from
his mother. This
is also the house
in which he grew
up. He is married
with three chil-
dren, and he is
still going strong
as the head of the
women’s pro-
gram. He has
stayed in his
hometown all his
life, and this town
means a lot to
him.

During

at the

this
free
agency, and people saying, “Show
me the money!” many coaches
have complained of burnout and
have wanted to move on. George
Siefert, on the professional level,

is one of those coaches. He told the
San Francisco 49ers that he just did
not want to coach any more.

Bruce does not think along
these lines. “That is the case for
some coaches, but I am from an era
of loyalty,” said Bruce. He spoke
of the values his
parents instilled
in him. They
talked about
sports stars being
lifers, and one
does not see that
much now.

Coach Bruce
tries to use this
philosophy here at
Pitt. He has no
plans to leave. He
said, “I will try
my best to make it
work here.” He
feels a great deal
of loyalty to Pitt
since he graduated from this school
and has worked here so long. He
cannot see any reason for him mov-
ing on to any other coaching posi-

After last year’s sec-
ond place finish at the Big

East Swimming and
Diving Championships,
men’s swimming Head
Coach Chuck Knoles
knew that he would need
a strong recruiting season
to push his team over the
top. '
He got all he wanted,
and more.

Pitt’s incoming fresh-
man class of swimmers
for the 1996-97 season is
widely considered one of
the best in the‘nation. A
large part of the accolades
is attributed to sprinter
Jerry Koller, one of the
hottest recruits coming
out of high school last
year

“Jerry Koller is the
blue chip of the blue
chips”, boasts Knoles.
“He was as highly recruit-
ed as anyone in the nation
last year.”

According to Knoles,
the main problem with
last year’s squad was that

 
 

the lineup had to con-
stantly be juggled, with
swimmers entering events
that they would not usual-
ly swim.

“We were too spread
out last year. We had to
put some kids in certain
events out of necessity.
This year we would like
to have a smaller nucleus
of core swimmers. The
season plan will be a lot
more solid throughout the
season.”

Koller fits perfectly
into this plan. His events
are set in stone — sprint
freestyle, which he does
better than almost anyone
else in the Big East. Jerry
has already. racked up
times for the 50-yard free
(20.40) and the 100-yard
free (45.70). These times
have him projected as the
second seed in both
events at the upcoming
Big East Championships.
Pretty impressive for any-
one, let alone someone
who was in high school
just one year ago.

However, Jerry still
sees himself as the under-

cially the 50,” Koller
says. “I like the underdog
role. I’d rather have it that
way.”

 

Aside from his per-“

sonal aspirations, Jerry keeps the good
of the team paramount in his mind.

’ “My goal is mainly to help bring
back the Big East Championship for
the team. It hasn’t been here for a few
years.”

Pitt’s three-year drought in Big
East Championships is a fact that
Koller knows well. He grew up in
nearby Bethel Park and was affiliated
with the swimming
team before he ever
got here. These rea-
sons, Jerry says,
were his main
motives in choosing
Pitt.

“Bethel Park is
only 20 minutes
away. I already
knew the coaching
staff and the team,
and I liked them a
lot. I was very com-
fortable right from
the beginning.”

Jerry also seems to be very com-
fortable with the academic curriculum
that he is undertaking here at Pitt. In
an era when most college athletes
direct focus towards their sports
prowess, Koller’s future plans could-
n’t be farther from the swimming
pool.

“Right now I want to be a teacher,

so I’m a dual business and education
major.”

Between swimming at one of the
top Division I programs in the country
and the rigors of a dual major, it does-
n’t leave Jerry much time to relax.

“I just hang out with the guys and
have a good time, because there’s not
much time to do anything else,”
Koller says.

However, when
 the swimming season
 is over, Jerry has a lot
 more of an opportunity
 to pursue his hobbies,
----- ~ =  one of which is a little
 peculiar for a top-
 notch swimmer.

“I golf in the
. spring, and I also box a
3 little.”

Boxing??

“I know it
sounds crazy, but I like
to mess around a little
bit.”

One has to look no further than
Jerry’s family to find out where he got
his fondness of the ring.

“My dad was a boxer, so he and I

just mess around sometimes.” .

The rest of the Big East is hoping
that Jerry Koller doesn’t unload his
own style of knockout punch come the
end of February. V

While Bruce playedfor the
Panthers, he earned three letters.
His fondest memories did not
come from the basketball court,
though. He remembers going to
wrestling meets to see his good
friend and now Pitt Wrestling
Coach Rande Stottlemyer. He
and his other friends used to go
see wrestling meets just to sup-
port each other. That was the
best thing he remembered from
college: friendships.

Bruce calls coaching a
“habit.” He gets up at 6 a.m.
each morning and helps his wife
get their children to school, and
then he comes straight to his
office to start working. “It is
entrained in me,” he said of
coaching. He said he would real-
ly miss it if it were gone.

Since Bruce started as an
athlete in 1971 at Pitt, many
things have changed. One of the
biggest things is women’s ath-
letics. The world has hit a new
point now. There are many more
women’s sports in the Olympics,
and just this year a Women’s
Professional Basketball League
started. This could create a
whole new dilemma for women
basketball players and their

  

 

‘ "    FROM PAGE 8 

’ *'.».é>..o.*;.

 

 

coaches.

Coach Bruce said, “The big
money is out there now.” He
does not want to see the day
when women have the chance to
leave school early like the men
do to play professionally. He
believes people should “take
advantage of the education.” In
his opinion, it is even tougher to
come back and finish an educa-
tion.

Finally, Bruce discussed his
job at Pitt and why it is so diffi-
cult to get players to come to
this school. He believes people
need to see the mix of people at
the school. He also wants to sell

the good education and his great‘

coaching staff to perspective
players.

His philosophy is to find the
“best available athlete.” Bruce
is very pleased with his recruit-
ing class for next year. The team
has two more players to sign,
but things look good for the
future.

If Coach Bruce stays dedi-
cated and his players keep get-
ting better like they have been,
there is no telling where this
program could go. CoacheBruce

_is a genuinely nice and dedicat— 1

ed person, and it really shows.

Two terms that best describe
Pitt sophomore center Mark Blount
are: hard work and enthusiasm.

While in high school, Blount
had been recruited by Louisville,
Syracuse, and Pitt. Blount said,
“The reason I chose Pitt was
[because] Ralph Willard came in
and gave me the opportunity to play

for him. I wanted somebody who,

had the trust in me to let me go out

there... and play in this league to
get better.”
Blount has most certainly

earned that trust. He is currently

averaging 7.9 points per game and
8.1 ‘rebounds per game. But the
trademark of the seven-foot, 240-
pound sophomore has become his
intimidating presence as a shot
blocker.

Blount is averaging 3.1 blocked
shots per game and is ranked first in
shot blocking in the Big East. In,
only his second season at Pitt,
Blount is already seventh all—time
on Pitt’s all-time blocked shots.list
with 80 shots blocked. He has
already passed teammate Gerald
Jordan (ranked eighth) and former
Pitt star Orlando Antigua (ranked
ninth).

Blount’s -shot blocking skills

haven’t' gone unnoticed by his
teammates.

“He blocks shots,” said Pitt
guard Jason Maile. “He’s a great
intimidator inside, which is some-
thing we need.”

Pitt forward Chad Varga said,
“Defensively, he’s able to block
shots, and that helps us out. He
starts the [fast] break off, blocks a
shot, kicks it out, and gets us going
on the break.”

Much of the success Blount is
having defensively this season can
be attributed to his hard work dur-
ing the past off-season.

“He’s obviously put on about 35

the squad may start seeping through the
red curtain of Pirate propaganda. After
the wrapping, loses its luster, fans will
realize that the new uniforms are really
just masking Philadelphia Phillies
rejects, triple-A has-beens, homegrown
busts, and lots of bad baseball.

Packaged with anything outside of A

cash giveaways, bad baseball doesn’t
sell.

Good baseball sells, regardless of
uniform. The Pirates of the 1970s
looked like circus performers, but they
won championships and packed stands.
Nobody cared that Willie Stargell
stretched those white shirts beyond
recognition. Nobody missed the
League Championship Series because
they thought Kent Tekulve looked bad
in a black and gold hat.

People went to Three Rivers to
watch the team win, not comment on
the merchandise. Talent mattered —
stilldoes, despite what some marketing
geniuses and their red magic markers
might think. Besides, players like
Tekulve look pretty bad in any uni-
form.

Now, the team that’s lived from
early and late-decade success since the
1960s (‘61, ‘71, ‘79, ‘89, ‘90, etc.)
enters the twilight of the 1990s with lit-
tle to go on but Kendall and red hats.
Boever and Sveum are not strong picks
to lead this team to the playoffs any-
time this millennia, perhaps not even
the next one. And hasn’t Elster been
playing since the early 1940s?

Without stars, all the team can
muster for public consumption is red.
Sadly, red doesn’t pack the stands
come August, when most of those
PirateFest fans are planning Steelers
preseason parties. Enjoy the merchan-
dising money now, Mr. McClatchy -
just don’t expect any ticket money
later.

Wednesday, February 5, ‘I997

Senior attacker Marc Polecritti
netted three goals and an assist to
lead the Pitt lacrosse team to an
11-2 blowout of St. Vincent
College on Saturday night.

The Panthers raised their
record to 1-0 with their win at St.

Vincent in front of more than 200

faithful Pitt fans.

“Overall, I was very pleased
with our play,” Head Coach Gary
Neft said. “For the first game of
the season, we played pretty well,
but we still have some things to
work on.”

Senior goaltender Dave Travis
and the Pitt defense was tough,
allowing only two goals, the sec-
ond coming late in the fourth quar-
ter. “Our defense was tremen-
dous,” Neft said. “They gave up
few shots and even fewer quality
shots.”

The game began with a few
scary minutes for-Pitt, when John
Gelsizer left the game early with
his second concussion in a week.
However, moments later, Polecritti
got the Panthers off to a fast start
for Pitt, scoring on a quick stick,
which is comparable to a one-timer
in hockey.

“[Po1ecritti’s] hat trick was
big,” co-captain Pat Shea said. “He
came in and scored a quick goal
that gave us a lift.”

The Panthers had five different
players scoring in the win with
Polecritti leading the way.

 

Panther lacrosse getting off
to a fast start with first win

Polecritti’s linemate, sophomore
attacker Matt Hoplamazain, also
netted a hat trick, and senior co-

captains Pat Shea and Rob Heapes 0

added offense and leadership. Shea
scored two goals, and Heapes
added one. Even freshman Dave
Corrado got in the mood, scoring
two goals and four assists.

“I’m very happy with the way I
played,” Polecritti said. “This is
the first time our line has played
together, and I’m very happy with
the way we are playing. This is an
excellent start to the season. We
just have to continue to step it up
and not get too cocky.”

The Panthers have a week to
enjoy their win until they play host
to Ohio University on Saturday,
Feb. 8, at 8:00 p.m. at the Cost
Center. ’ ‘

Ohio University is a first-year
team, but they could give the
Panthers some problems. Neft said
that their players are very experi-
enced and have played together
prior to forming a team. '

“We have some things to work
on before this week’s game with
Ohio University,” coach Neft said.
“This is our first league game and
it is a big game. This game will be
tougher than this past one with St.
Vincent.”

“We’re looking forward to
Ohio University,” Shea said. “That
is a big game. We were kind of
rusty, but we played pretty well.
We’re especially grateful for the
fans. We had great fan support this
past Saturday.” .

“I think the big thing with Mark

Maile agrees, “Mark brings

He gets after it every game.”

The coaching staff also recog-

Pitt basketball.
