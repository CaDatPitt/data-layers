"Today the Pitt ,bo.xcrs begin
. training for. .tlicirv-ei.ghth*year,
: in Uiiivepsity sports. __For seven
 years tlieistjuad has been in the
, making.»-u-*ndc‘ri‘ hot  favora-
.blc circuinstancesag and for
seven years, observers have been
.,wondering how, and even; why,
they do it. A .  .
I This story goes back, tVo 193.90
when a-buinch of husky lads, pre‘—
3 dominanVtly,fo_otVball players, decid-
ed they‘ wanted a"'boxin'g team.
Approaching - various athletic

 

authorities, they found practically ,

no encouragement. There were
no facilities in the ﬁrst place, and
-besides; the whole thing had‘ the
appearance of being just a passing
notion.

A Few Towels.

The; notion stuck, however. Don
Harrison continued to,. stumble
over the lobbying pugilists“ every
time he tried to" get into his office.
Fina1ly,- when it began to look as
though the boys were serious,
Harrison and sbox-"ing coach‘ "Joe
Orsini. decidedthat -it Was time to
do something about i-t. And so, in

February,-I193-l,the first ‘Univer-- ~

-sity boxing squad, under Orsini,
started training. 

During that" first year, practice
was held in theold track house",
with no_ boxing ring and no heat‘.
Total, equipment, amounted to one
sandbags,-V.-.' twin headgears, V two
stools,» one bell, "six set of gloves,
and‘ a few‘ towels.

Since the group was comprised
largely of football men, there was
a lack “of ﬁghters in thii lighter"
weight classes. For the most part
the squad had no boxing experi-
ence whate"ver,',.wi-th such excep-
tions as John Luch, heavyweight
and varsity fullback, and. Harry
Conti, local _ amateur feather-
weight. In all, there were about
30 men on ‘the squad.

So Much For History

Informal matches were arranged
that year with Duquesne, Tech,
and West Virginia in collegiate
circles, and With. the H. T. Little
club of Homestead. Although the
team lost all of these matches by
a margin of one or two bouts, the
showing they made was surpris-
ing. The freshman squad had its
one and only match with Rankin
high school, which resulted  a
tie. One of the more promising
freshman was a scowling, tight-
lipped kid named Jack Schricker,
now coach of the squad.

For the next few years the team
just, about broke even. In 1932
they won two niiatches, lost two,
and tied one. The next year, with
a fuller schedule, the team did
not quite so well. During that
time the squad worked out wher-
ever it" could while football season
was on. In 1933, when the foot-
ball team went to the Rose Bowl,
the boxers did not get-.started in
their training until just two weeks
before ‘their ﬁrst‘~‘match,~ sincethe
Pitt eleven had to use the stadium
throughout December.  . ..

So ihuchmheh, for history. The
team has progressed; ‘ and every
step of that progress has meant a
tough stru‘ggie_ for “both coaches
and boxers. ' It “has meant working
with inadequate facilities; it has
meant ﬁghting schools with many
years of boxing experience behind
them; it 'hasV‘i‘n'eant trying I0 1'9-
cruit new men from a_ ‘student-
body which is rather indifferent,
as a whole, to the “minor sports.”

New Problems
Whe‘reas,~ in the early days,
there was a scarcity of lighter
men, the problemi now is to ﬁnd
men for the heavier weightclasses:
‘Many potential boxers are lost
to the football squad. Usually, a
man. who has gone out for football
must, either, from choice or neces-
sity, forget athletics after the sea-‘
son is over and make up for lost
time in his studies. . ...   V
Today,‘-the outlook for the Pitt
boxers is quite encouraging. Sev-

Five Hundred Sixty-Seven

AR outdistancing any prediction, the num-
ber of students taking the \Vassermann
tests has now reached 567. . . .

\Vhen The News began this program in
cooperation with the health services and the
Pittsburgh department of public. health, We,
were told that “if you get 100 or 150 people
to take the test, you will be doing remarkably
well.” _ ‘ _,

The highest estimate made by people inter-
ested was 400 students. '

The News felt that the number would be
much larger than the estimates. ~

Results speak for themselves. In spite of
the fact that the tests got a. late start on Mon-.,
day, and that the remainder of the week was"
dull and rainy, students went to thehealth
services in such numbers that the services ‘did’
a turn-away business.

Too, for several days there wassome trou-
ble in obtaining test tubes—-—the city never ex-
pected such. a rush of mass \Vassermans. How-
ever, once Dr. I. H. Alexander, health director, ‘
saw the tremendous interest shown here in
the Wassermanns, he supplied the health serv-

And so, the second week of the program to
adininister the blood tests begins. The number
of students who have not yet taken their ex-
amination, either through failure to get down
to -theshealth services, or ‘because __ the health
services couldnot, in View of the rush, Mac'-
commodate all who wanted to take the exami-
nations, should make the goal for the end of
this week upwards of 1,000.

You Guess What

OU HAVE heard the stories--of the disillu-

sioned college student who stacks up
against these “big world problems” and not
only is. convinced that nothing can be done
about things but is convinced also that nothing
is worth doing anything about.

That attitude has seemed to us to have cer-
tain fallacies, which we could see through in a‘
practical way, but the critics of theattitude,
the “God ’s - in - his - heaven-all ’s—well-with-the
world-people,” still haven ’t given us any
plausable answers.

~ Over across the Paciﬁc there ’s the little mat-
ter of Japan invading the China. There ’s also
an International Settlement where a few loyal
subjects of "a western power were wiped out
the other day. There ’s a, little problem of pos-
sible severence of diplomatic relations between
Japan and England. ' '

A short 20th Century distance from the Far
East is‘ a place called Europe, the scene of
diplomacy. Again the latest diplomatic farce,
this one at Brussels, has bogged down. I

.-A Non-Intervention Committee on the Span-
ish situation never did ’ function effectively.
’The much-heralded League’ of Nations promises
:to fade into touching memories.

In the meantime there ’s a feud going on be-
‘tween the disciples of State-socialism, and col-
;lectivism'. Capitalistic-democracy is in both
their ways. . ' ‘ '

Hitler and Mussolini met on a balcony. In
the past‘ several years they have been thinking
about Russia——-and vice-versa. It wasn’t pleas-
ant thinking. -

_England and France can ’t seem to make, up
their minds about just what to do.

-America? Oh, she doesn’t have to worry
about anything—except those things noted
above . . . and drops in the stock market, a sur-
plus of unemployed, a rising cost‘ of living,
large slum areas and inadequate housing, and
several other minor things.

What ’s going to happen in the near future? ,

Well‘, you tell us. Or label this “continued

Of course they liked it. Oh my yes. Every time
William Powell ran into a door or fell on his face‘
everyone laughed and laughed, but that was only
because they were all morons. They never stopped‘
to think how humiliating it must have been for: Mr.
Powell to get his laughs in this way after “My Man
Godfrey” and “The Thin Man.” Mr. Powell, I might
explain, acts a sort of high principled esthete who
lives in a trailerand is on the make for frigid busi- ~

In order to make Myrna, Powell goes after her

Stanley Y
Best entertainmentin town this week is being,
offered by the Stanley. To say the stage show is ‘
good is to understate, so I'll say the stage show is
very good. Bunny Berigan heads‘ the list with the
hottest white band in the business. I’ll admit that
this is strictly an outsider’s_opinion, but after hear-
ing both Goodman and Berigan I think that-,Bunny’s
“I Can’t Get Started With You” and “The Prisoner’:
Song” are as good as anything the King of Swing
ever beat out. ‘
In addition there is a youngvdance team. which
does the shag, I think——I’m not sure--butlanynway
they were the best and when I say the best“ I mean
they were -good... They .wer.e encorgd, four times
and even that wasn’t enough. Also on the 'oil_1"wei-e
the McKenna’s, a comedy dance team, and they,‘ too,
were good. (No, I feel the same as ever). ‘
The ﬁlm is titled the “Perfect Specimen” starring.
; Joan Blomdell and Errol Flynn. It could have been
better with someone else.
more like a chorineithan a ,eomedienne,.and inthis
picture she seemed to be missing pretty boy Powell.
Errol, on the other hand, had to wear clothes :1
goodbit of the time and that did him no good. ‘
Yet, all that to the contrary nothwithstanding, it
was ‘a fairly funny picture." Errol is a rich young
boy being brought up by hisgrandmother to be the
“perfect specimen.” He is the heir to some -ten
thousand employees and his ‘grandmother wants
to make sure he’s better than all of them. ' Y
VVell he’s getting to be pretty’ good allright but
he’s not having any fun, if you know what I mean.
Consequently it isn’t hard for a shapely wench like

'Blondell..to make him kick over the traces and go

off on what the Tuesday Morning Mothers’ Club
call escapades for short.

Aside from the technical end, however, the" pic-

way of story. There seems to be no plot. Maybe

over a period _of as littlemore than
five years, amounted to $1647.46."

CORRECT CREDIT LINES

When this song became interna-
tionally famous, Foster regretted
his,decision. He wrote to Christy,
offering to refund. the money, send
Christy’s band.-of minstrels a song
written in his best style, free of
charge, and to, advance the Christy
interests in any way possible
thereafter, if Christy Y. would be
willing to let the song bear Fos-
ter’s name. He said: .

‘‘I find I cannot write at all un-
less ",1 write. for publicIapproba-

But Christywas, not willing to
do what would amount to admitt-

-ing publicly that he was not the

composer of the song. It was 15
years. after Foster*s“‘~death‘ before
the published copies of the song
bore the correct credit lines.

Seventh Floor Gallery

Exhibits Primitive Art

By AUSTIN HAY

A new exhibit in ﬁne arts gallery, seventh ﬂoor of the Cathe-
dral, is composed of fresco paintings, tapestry, and reproduc-
tions of fresco, which, despite their comparatively little worth,
stand up well with the technically valuable originals.

Two Russian iconsof the seventeenth century are repiti-

 ..  if  . . _ Y _ Y A _ -“‘_i'__t_i‘(;>Iis, of thé. Byzantine formula. which

prising to learn that it‘ contains more first cditioiis of Foster’s
music than any other collection in existence.  “ ‘A

During his brief lifetime, Foster wrote 201 original songs
and 'con1p_osi.tionS, and arranged and translated approximately
100 works written by other musicians. The Foster Hall collec-
tion" ¥‘~in’clude's”f_irst edition of an: _
‘ prior to 1900. But the first edi-

 type ‘bf art, Iinowe

much {sought after, is symbolic of
religious doctrine-—having practi-
cally _no¥sense.of realism. Death
of the. Virgin characterizes the
first iconic piece, the other sym-
bolizing the descent of Christ and
Resurrection with broken gates of
Hell. deftly variegated in a promi-
nent background. ‘

A Spanish primitive fresco of
the fifteenth century exempliﬁes
the presentation of the Virgin.
This retablo, part of eight large
painted backgrounds to an altar,
was from Catalonia.

From the town of Tournai in
Flanders came a fragment of a
large tapestry woven for a cathe-
dral altar frontal. This great
tapestry represents St. Francis, at-
tended by St. Peter and Bernard,
receiving. the stigmata. In the
background is the city of Morocco.
This devotional type of later me-
dieval tapestry is from the best

and most productive period of '

tapestry weaving.
Interesting is the comparison of
Fra Angelico and the German

A Stephen Lochner.

Affair, 25-14. »  " I

 ‘f By LEONARD. LEv1soN
Sports Editor

Football, oh football. Yes,
there was plentyof football to

.—be seen in the ‘Stadium on Sat-

urday afternoon as the Scotch-
.’men of Carnegie Tech met the
Pitt disciples of Sco1and’s cur-
rent favorite son, Dr. Jock

xsutherland, in what resulted in
.one of. October’s richest point-

making harvests, with the Pan-
thers reaping in "the largest. haul,

_ 25-14.

Saturday’s environment seem-
ed to smack of an anuual Suther-
There was a
touch of spring in the air, the foot-
ball that was demonstrated was

. nothing but the Sutherland techni-

que in operation, and the program
boy who. shouted, “They all look
i really had

Tech scooted out into the Sta-

-dium not only with the Panther

style of play, but also in Blue and
Gold uniforms. And then there

‘was Bill Kern and Eddie Baker

sitting on the Tartan bench.
EVERYTHING HAPPENS

Whoever uttered that popular
profundity, “You can’t have
everything,” never really saw a
Pitt-Tech game. ‘This was the
twenty-fourth gridiron meeting
between the two schools, the vic-
tory being number 19 for the Pan-
thers, but the game seemed to be
..a synoposis' of everything that has
gone before. * 

There was everything. Drama,
thrills. long runs, forward passes,
clear-cut‘ blocking, hard—hitting
‘tackling, and then the two teams
showed just how points are made
in football games. The only scor-

ing tactic that was not utilized’

Novice FloorTouriiey

was that which gives one point for
not showing up at the game. And
there was even some pre-game
‘talk that Tech might consider this
policy.

There even was that Halloween
spirit in the air. Instead of the
customary witches riding on high,
it was footballs. And they cer-
tainly did enough to haunt the
Panthers. Aportent of what was
"to come occured on the game’s first
scrimmage play. Tech ran the
ball back to its 20-yard mark
from Petro’s opening kick-off and
from its ﬁrst line-up, Tech went
into a forward pass formation.
The ﬁrst pass was knocked down,
but it indicated what the Tar-
tans were thinking about.

PLENTY OF PASSES

All week the Tartans had been
throwing pigskins around the
Tech Bowl and Saturday they
kept right on doing it. Both of
those Tech scores came from
above. Just as soon as play be-
gan in the second period, Pete
Moroz» entered the game. “Moroz
was one Tartan back whose cap-
abilities had been kept subdued
up to the point where Tech meets
Pitt.

After Stebbins fumbled (it’s an
old Panther custom), on the 21-
yard line, Carnegie took the ball.
Moroz snatched it from Kopcsak,
faded back and threw an arch-
ing pass to Bob Howarth, who
was standing undisturbed with a
teammate. Where the Pitt second-
ary was, is perhaps, beside the six
points. It- should be mentioned,
however, that they were some-
where behind the line of scrim-
mage. _

After Kopcsak accomplished
the extra point, Tech found itself
in the same spot it had been
against the Iirsh a few weeks
ago. They were leading, 7-6.
Pitt’s score had come ﬁrst, fol-
lowing Lezouski’s block of Lee’s
recovered,
and which .Patrick on a line buck
from the 2.-yard line made count
for the “ﬁrst Pitt score. 

SOUCHAK SAVES

Those” moments of uneasy
breathing were alleviated with 15

Stadium Court j

Today will show the ﬁrst effects
of the Hagen Plan. There will
be plenty of" de—emphasization
when the novices push the varsity
basketball tea.m"right oﬁ the Sta-
dium practice ﬂoor.

The freshmen have turned like
they have never turned out before
for the yearly basketball tourney,
sponsored by Dr. H. C. ‘Red” Carl-
son, varsity basketball coach. And
there is a large turn-out of upper-
classmen too.

Entries can still be entered at
the stadium today. The large num-
ber will assure anyone who has
held off that there--will be‘ plenty
of fun and competition. There
will be opportunity to show Coach
Carlson what you can do as a
player. Many varsitymen have
risen from the ranks of the novices.

The games will start at‘3 o’clock
in the stadium. The early bird
gets the worm is the motto gov-
erning the contests, so get there
early and get to play ﬁrst. But if
you are going to be late don’t
worry. Everyone will play. Ac-
cording to the system worked by
the sponsor, there will be plenty
of time for everyone to get on the
ﬂoor.

_ PLAY FOR ALL

That won’t be as subs or extras,
either. Everyone plays as.__.a' ﬁrst-
stringer, for a full gamef-_ That
will. mean plenty of fun, exercise,
and a chance to make the varsity
coach sit up and take notice.

Hollywood

Presenting, Tuesday, matinee,
that dynamic personality, that
star of stars, Dr. H. C. Carlson in
the most stupendous collosal pro-
duction of all times: The Movie of
Champions.

Yes sir, the varsity basketball
coach is in the movies. He talks,

and acts like the best. In fact the
only criticism .; was offered by

ing the ﬁrst time, “Holy Moses, do
I look old.” ‘

The movie was one made this
summer showing the methods,
skills, fundamentals, and offen-
sive and defensive team play sys-
tems of the champion coaches of

the champion basketball teams of
the country.

In it Dr. Carlson shows his
methods. After» a ‘brief introduc-
tion, an all-star team, including
Pitt’s famous Charlie Hyatt,
‘shows the plays in an actual dem-
onstration, while Pitt’s varsity

tails. , 
Along w_ith‘Dr. Carlson in the
movies are Phog Allen of Kansas

Mississippi Valley champions, last
year; Clar Bee, whose Long Isl-

A  .Aw;ait;..A~pproval 

By BOB ANGROS
Although there has been no of-
ﬁcial sanction, as yet, Pitt will have

- a. hockey team, Len Broido, for-

mer star center of the ﬂashy Arn-
old Preps and now coach and cap-
tain of a group of Pitt students,
has called the-initial pra_ctice of
the season today  '5 o’clock on
the Duquesne Garden ice. A

It was proven by a plucky bunch-
of Pitt puckmen lust yea: that
hockey has a deﬁnite place in Pitt
athletics. Led ‘by Bob Schooley
this little bandhit the ice three

"mornings a week at 6 o’clock. to

prepare for battles with Tech and
Duquesne. , '

In the face of indifference‘ on the
part of Pitt ofﬁcials, Schooley and
his boys really stuck their guns
and showed promise of developing
into a strong combination in the
one game against Tech. Tech won,
to be sure, but_ that was beside the
point '

THREE TEAMS To REPORT

What was important is the fact
that hockey that night was suc-
cessfully revived and seemed to
earn a spot in the athletic setup of
the university." "

Not only the Pitt boys, but the
Tech and Duke icemen sported the

’:na-kings of 2 hockey -teams that

couldreally give and take on the
ice.
‘Broido expects close to three full

‘teams to report today. Plans call
for‘ several w'eeks‘4'of practice be-
It was Lezouski, who ;fore the ﬁrst-game. " ‘ '

It has not been. determined as
yet ‘just ‘what ‘-kind" ofha schedule
the Pittmen will fh'ave' to face. But,
it is reasonably’ certain, to be
a round’ robin 'with'Tech and Duke
or an ~ elimination tourney.

According to Joel Bennet, man-
ager, no other teams have been
conta,cted,=but he stands open to
book practice’ games. "

ON THIN ICE

The greatest . difficulty ‘will be

With no

carry .it ‘through its embryonic,
stage, hockey ‘at ‘Pitt will-_have to

;depend‘on thefjgefiierosity of John-

ny Harris ,. in " donating the ‘ice’ be-
tween periods of regular scheduled
pro games. ' , '

Broido requests that all candi-
dates report to him at Duquesne
Garden this evening. at 5 o’clock.

Candidates * will-Vhave‘ to supply

their own equipment for the time
being. Regular practice will be
held for an hour every day. Coach
Broido will require "regular and
prompt attendance‘ to qualify for
positions. , '
The ﬁrst game is tentatively
scheduled sometime the third or
fourth week in November and will
probably be between halves of a
regularly scheduled Yellow Jacket
game. ‘ ‘ I " .
While the official okay has no
been uttered yet, it should not be
far away. Hagan has stated that
if there is enoughstudent interest
in hockey, he will be more than
pleased’ to throw the University‘
backing behind it. I '

V The
cabinet_ of ten memberswill have

; three representatives A’ from the

each from the mining and petro-
leum departments, and three from
the metalurgy department.

The reorganization plan was
started two weeks ago under the

guidance of Dr. E. A. Holbrook,-~

dean of the Schools of Engineer-
ing and Mines, when each depart-
ment of the ‘school appointed two
representatives to formulate
plans for the new association. Ray

of this committee.

Under thenew plan, the cabi-
net, which will elect its officers at
its ﬁrst»mee'ting,» will control‘ all
activities of the School of Mines.

bly be similar in scope to that of
the Engineering‘ Association.

During the past few years, the“
School of Mines" association has"
been inactive. Mines ‘students

have supported: the functions a_n*'-cl ‘

purposes of the Engineering As-

sentatives in the EAC cabinet.
