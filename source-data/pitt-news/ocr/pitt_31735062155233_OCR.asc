Four Schools to Share

Abandoned Nike Site

Bycniusmairrm

The University has picked a Plum—an 8.08 acre section;
of an abandoned Nike base in Allegheny county’s Plum Bor-
ough. The land came to the University gratis through thje:

Department of Health, Education
and Welfare, courtesy of a 1949
law which permits unused gov-
ernment land to be given to pub-
lic institutions. -
The land was ﬁrst made avail-
able around 1960 and institutions
interested submitted detailed lists
which showed what they planned
to do with the land. The Uni-

versity was awarded the site a

few months later, although the
deed was not officially trans-

’ ‘ ferred until this week.

The University departments of
earth and planetary sciences,
physics, physiology, and pharma-
cology which have projects slated

. for the area will make use of

ﬁve standing buildings on the
control area acreage. Included
are three small control buildings,
a two-level barracks and a mess
hall located about a half mile
inside the barbed-wire perimeter
of the base. ‘

One of the proiects destined
for the base is a center for study-
ing the earth’s magnetic ﬁeld and

.“earth tides”—the displacement

of large areas of the earth's crust
resulting from the gravitational
pull of the moon. This will neces-
sitate the building ot an under-
ground tunnel to house the‘ sen-
sitive equipment needed for meas-
urement. This project will be par.
tially underwritten’ by the U. S.
Coast Guard and the Geodetic
Survey who are interested in this
type or research.

Also slotted for room will be
the School of 1°harmacy, which

Theatre
Plans Play

The University Theatre has an-
nounced that its second produc-
tion of the 1964-65 season will be
the sophisticated children’s play
Raynard, The Fox, by Arthur
Fauquez. The play, said director
Dr. William H. Kingsley, is an
unusual one in Children’s The
atre repertoire. It attempts, said
Dr. Kingsley, to say something
signiﬁcant to the child about the
adult world by portraying .a uni-
verse less beneﬁcent than that
children are ordinarily exposed
to. ~

Dr. Kingsley noted that this
play marks a departure from the
standard Chﬂdren’s Theatre fare
of watered -down fairly tales,
domestic comedy situations and
tame modern-day adventures.

Performances will be presented
in the Stephen Foster Memorial
at 8:30 p.m. on Dec. 10, 11, and
12, with a matinee at 2:30 p.m.
on Dec. 12.

{As Fine Man, Coach
»~.','!Editor, The Pitt News:

We are writing as former soccer play-
._ers who feel that the article by Marvin
Zelkowitz which .appeared in the Nov. 20
issue of The Pitt News is unfair to coach
{Leo Bemis, both as a man and a coach,
and is apparently the result of incomplete
and biased information.

_ As players under coach Bemis we en-
joyed some of the finest athletic experi-
-ences of our lives. We could not have had
these experiences if we had not been en-
couraged and instructed by aMr. Bemis
-from the time we were “green” beginners
to the last game of our careers as Pitt
athletes,

 Many of us knew nothing about the
sport until we came to Pitt. We had noth-
:i_n"g with which to start. Mr. Bemis was
the man who asked us to come out for
,‘_team and then‘ gave freely of his time and
attention to help us learn soccer.

' lrr DISTURBED us to ﬁnd Mr. Zelko-
owitz writing about players who freely
criticize their coach. It is easy to stand
{back and point ﬁngers when things are
not going well. A real athlete tries his
%very best to do something about the sit-
nation. we would like to ask that out-
Jspoken player who provided Mr. Zelko-

    
 
 
 
  
   
  
  
 
 
  
   
   
 
  
  
  
 
 
   
  
   
    
  
  
    
     
   

-’done to get his team on the winning track.
Did he carry his share of the load, and
‘carry it willingly?

H Mr. Bemis has brought soccer a long
;way at Pitt. Some of us can remember
‘playing on a soccer club team that was
not recognized as .a varsity athletic or-
ganization. If it were not for Mr. Bemis
carrying the student’s word to the higher
"echelon of the_ athletic department, Pitt
‘soccer might never have become a var-
ty sport. =

here at Pitt it has progressed very well.

Thanksgiving holiday. Most of them were Uni-
versity students, and most of these were won1-
en dorm students with 12:30 curfews. All of
them had reservations and all were bounced
from the overbooked flight with a shrug from
the Allegheny agent’s shoulders and a “Sorry
folks. There’s another flight at midnight, but
that’s ﬁlled, so the‘ next one isn’t till four a.m.
Try the airport motel or take a bus or some-

thing.”

There were screams and tears and dumb-
founded expression as ﬂight 829 took off
while ﬁfteen of its expected passengers watch-
ed. Some of them had luggage on the plane.
Some had people meeting them who were driv-
ing 30 miles into Pittsburgh. And most of them
had classes the next morning.

They swore; a father tried to force his way

onto the field to stop the plane and tore up a
pile of tickets on the counter in his frustration.
Some of them ﬁnally went home to take the
ﬁrst open ﬂight the following day at 3-200; oth-
ers went to the airport motel to wait till 4:00
a.m. But half of them persisted until Alle-
gheny put on a bigger plane for the 12:00
take-off, and considered themselves lucky to
straggle into the snowy Quad at 3:00 a.m.

Perhaps I am still too iealistic to accept the

mad.

Enwright States Position 4 /

Editor: THE PITT NEWS:

The story by Bob Smizik about fraternity social probation in your issue of
Nov. 18 and thelaccompanying editorial understandably represent the position of The
Pitt News. We feel that they ‘do not fairly represent the position of the Office of the
Dean of Men or the basis for that position. We hope you can ﬁnd space to publish
this statement in full so that readers will have an understanding of it.

The general policy of this office is not to make public statements about official
involvements of individual students or of student groups. This is not done to deny
information to your newspaper or to “rose color” any happenings on the campus. It
is done to maintain our integrity on some of the most fundamental points of student

» personnel ethics.

We believe that any case“ of violation of “University standards requiring official

_action must be approached as a teaching opportunity _for us and a learning expe_ri- _
‘ence for the student or student group; no other view is tenable or defensible. iWe

are obligated to maintain the University’s standards, but we are also obligated to
work with violators in Ways which will promote their conscious, positive development

and increased maturity inathe future.

THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE is corrective, not punitive, although punitive action
may have to underlie sincere self-correction. Detailed_statements of offenses and pen-
alties cause unwarr.anted and underserved damage to reputations and always give-

rise to resentment which deters, if not entirely defeats, the constructive ends,whic'h .,-:- :;

we try to serve. a

The investigation and handling of standards violations,_ requires personal con-
ﬁdence and privileged communication-.~ Highly spersonal‘ infonrfation is often involved,
which, if revealed, could cause irrepar.able, life-long damage. Violation of this pro-
f9S5i0n31 conﬁdence 01‘ Publication of such personal information would be an un-

thinkable break of trust.

Unfortunately, any statementwhich, preserves thestudent?s' or group's inalien-
able right to privacy in personal matters is usually unsatisfactory. for publication,'and
is more damaging than nogstatement at all. I .

Much more could be said about these matters but we hope that the foregoing
will place the Office of the Dean of Men unmistakably on record and explain the most

_ basic, ethical justiﬁcations for a position which may otherwise seem arbitrary.

Parker F. Eiiwright, Assistant Dean of Men

proved. So have Pitt teams. You don’t
have that kind of progress with the type
of coach that was described in Mr. Zelko-
witz’s article.

We would suggest that when thinking
of writing a story, Mr. Zelkowitz should
check all the sources of“ information on

the subject so that he can really get with '

it, or else change the title'of his column.

Validity of Editorial
Questioned by Coeds

 

,Editor, The Pitt News:

A recent Pitt News editorial (Nov. 203
claimed Dean Rush never mentioned that
the women students’ opinion poll for the
two housing proposals would not be the
basis of a decision. The fact is that from
the beginning, Dean Rush made this very
clear. ' '

The AWS Housing Board urged dormi-
tory presidents, senior assistants, and
floor representatives" to inform the stu-
dents that the panel discussion would be
followed by an opinion poll which would
not be the decisive factor. At the panel
discussion Dean Rush clearly said mass
student opinion would not inﬂuence the
administrative decision, and anyone who

was there knows this is true.

The Pitt News does, not have to “rose-
color” its articles,’ but neither should it
produce a scandal sheet‘. There is a great
difference, between - reporting the facts

   

    

When anyone makes a statement, he
deserves ‘to be quoted exactly. The three
little periods (. . .) used to separate edited
quotes is a rule of grammar and should
have been used when Lois Turkes’ com-
ment at the panel discussion was reported
(Nov. 20, p. 3); Lois Turkes was not
quoted exactly.

We are not basing our criticism on
The Pitt News past, but on current issues.
How can The Pitt News expect coopera-
tion from the University community if it
will not cooperate ' in reportnig news
accurately?

Cut in Scholarships’
Decried by Reader

Editor, The Pitt News:

All the official pronouncements of the
administration of this University would
lead one to believe that a thorough at-
tempt is being made to improve the qual-
ity of the school. The ambition is a laud-
able one to be sure, and I think there
have been some signiﬁcant improvements.
The honors program has been expanded,
and there are apparently plans ultimately
to make.it an “across-the-board” program;
a number of adjustments in the distribu-
tion courses have been made; most pro-
fessors will openly assert that the courses

they are teaching now are more demand- .
‘ing than thosevthey conducted a few years
 .-.ago. -All this. isvery,

  
 

cliicanery of big business; perhaps I have yet
to learn to be pragmatic and understand that
overlooking planes insures a consistent proﬁt.
But when such worldliness causes such an un-
forgiveable situation from a group of people,
that business is no longer serving. It‘s money

If you learn from others’ experience, don't '
~ fly Allegheny at all.

But in view of the fact that the ad-
ministration is seriously considering a cut
in student ‘aid, it appears that they have
forgotten the most vital component of a
good school: good students. The academic.
standing of this University cannot be
raised unless the students are here who
are capable of raising it.

IMPROVED COURSE offerings are of
little value in the absence of students who
can take full advantage of them. Fairly
obviously, then, the students who are at-
tending this University on academic schol-
arships (and thus by deﬁnition are better-
than-average students) are among those
(:ontributi1'_1g most to its improvement.

These scholarships are not just amiable .
little pats on capable backs. There are
students at this University to whom they
represent the foundation of an academic
career. To be brutally speciﬁc, for many

students a 10 per cent reduction in schol- 7
 arship aid would irnperil academic‘exis-

tence; the suggested 25 per cent reduction
would end it. .It is as simple—and as
fiightening—as that.

I suppose it is difficult for an admin-
istration accustomed to spending millions
of dollars in the erection‘ of imposing
buildings to appreciate the' critical impor-
tance of every single dollar of aid to the
scholarship student. But I think the effort
needs to be made. The student is in a
pretty, helpless position. For what more
is he to do when he is already participat-
ing in the federal student-loan’ program
to the maximum the law permits? What
more can he do when he is already em-
ployed part-time.

THE SITUATION, it seems to me, re-
duces itself to simple, and not very at-
tractive, terms: serious, capable students

‘are-—by taking advantage of student-loan

programs (and thereby mortgaging sev-
eral years of their lives after graduation),
by holding part-time jobs, and, most im-
portantly, by performing scholastically to
the very best of their ability——fulﬁlling
their responsibilities to themselves and to
society. The University, on the other hand,
now proposes to abandon its responsibil-
ity to produce the most highly educated
citizens that irngaination .and industry and
dedication can conspire to produce.

Superior ﬁnished products are the re-
sult of a combination of superior meth-
ods and superior material. Does the Uni-
versity seriously intend to reject much of
its ﬁnest material? Can it afford to?

ROTC Enrollment Jumps

Freshmen enrollment in the
University's Army Reserve Oﬁi-
cer’s Training Corps (ROTC) is
up twofold in the last two years

llffzaccording to Lt. Col. Benjamin
Hollis, professor of military sci-
ence. ’

In 1962, 58 freshmen were en-
rolled in the Army ROTC pro-
gram. Last year the ﬁgure rose

to 104 while this fall the total
jumped to 139 freshmen.

The overall enrollment in Army
ROTC went from 182 cadets in
1962 to 193 in 1963 with this
year’s total at 267 cadets.

With the recent increase in
ROTC pay to $1,000 and other
beneﬁts, Col. Hollis expects this
trend of enrollment to continue.

Mike Johnson, Frank O’Korn,
Tom Baily, Dino Boni, Tom Hen-
iif, Lee Hall, and Bill Beck are
the only returning lettermen.

“We’re short-handed in the
heavier weights,” said Peery,
“and we don't have much depth
on the squad.” Tony Liberati, a
junior lacking varsity experience,
is currently the only wrestler in
the 123 pound division.

Heniﬁ and sophomore Terry
Sullivan wrestle at .130, while
Don Caslow and Tom Roberts
back up Johnson in the 137
weight class. Johnson won the
130 pound title in last year’s
Eastern Intercollegiate Wrestling
Tournament and was named the
tournament's outstanding wrest-
ler.

Both Boni and O’Korn provide
experience in the 147 pound
class. Although Baily, sophomore
Cliff Zolikoﬂ’, and George Hason
rank in the 157 pound division,
Baily is the only man with var-
sity experience.

Matmen Depthless;
, Face Poor Season,
Says Coach Peery

By BILL CABIN
Lack of depth hinders the Wrestling team this year,
and there is no apparent solution. “I look for this year to“
be my worst in 14 years,” said coach Rex Peery. Captain

gest problem. Hall wrestles at
177, but Peery named no one for
the 191 pound and heavyweight
divsions. Beck and Bill Bodle are
probable starters in these divi-
sions, but Bodle is still hamper-
ed by a football injury.

The matmen lost three good
heavyweights from last year.
Heavyweight Bill Buchanan and
Tim Gay, a. 167 pounder, had aca-
demic trouble. And George Rad-
man, the top freshman prospect,
transferred to Michigan State.
Gay placed third in the Easterns
and sixth in the Nationals while
wrestlingat 157 potmds in 1963.

John Carr, a 157 pounder,
transferred to Wilkes College, and
Dave Clery, at 137 pounds,
transferred to Oklahoma Univer-
sity.

“We~can’t afford any injuries,”
said Peery, “because we just don't
have enough men to fill the
spots.”

Peery had the same problem
last year, but salvaged a 7-2 rec-
ord and ranked second in the
East. “They surprised me last
year,” he said, “and I hope they
do it again this season.” Peery
has compiled a 112-37-3 record in
the 15 years here.

Disappointing Football Teami
Shows Some Bright Moments

The Panther football fans and players only have mem-
ories to think back on now and most of them were bad.
The 3-5-1 mark posted this year was the worst since the

3-7 record in 1961.

The high points of the season
were few but several outstanding
things did happen. First was the.
running of Barry McKnight who
led the Panthers in scoring and

11 gap left by the graduation of

Rick Leeson and will be back

 next season also.

Also notable was the play of

{_ linebackers Ray Popp and Marty
; Schottenheimer in the Navy

game. Both made tackles in key

 situations and hampered the play

{i Roger Staubach. In fact, Schot-

Z tenheimer has been named to the

i "second team NEA All-America
" team. He also led the team in

1_ tackles. -

Another high point was the
whole team’s showing‘ in the

 Notre Dame game. The Panthers

: played all season ahnost upset

Nucleus for Panther Hoopsters

The three lettermen returning

Larry Szykowny. “The difference
between this year’s team and last
year’s,’ ’said Timmons, _“is ex-
perience. Last year’s team played

together for four years and they
knew each others moves.

“This season the team is young
and inexperienced and it will
take time for the team to learn
to work together. Because of lack
of height and inexperience we
will have to rely on ball con-
trol.” In the past few seasons

the Panthers have used the fast
break quite successfully.

“Last season we would setup
either Cal Sheffield or Brian Gen-
eralovich,” said Timmons, “how-
ever, this year the whole team
will have to score.

“I guess our big scorers will
be Lovett, Szykowny and Ruby.
The whole team will have to
learn to score and I think they
have the ability. Falenski should
start scoring after he plays awhile,
and Dave Blyshak should be most
effective against a zone. Brian
Fisher, our sixth man, could be
a good scorer also.”

Defensively the Panthers won’t
have any new strategy, according
to Timmons. “We’ll still play an
aggressive type defense to com-
pensate for our lack of height.”

Last year Paul ‘Kreiger was
strong enough to get his share
of rebounds and this helped the
defense. This season Bob Lovett
who is 6’5”, will have to control

the boards, and guard the otlieij
team’s big men,

“Lovett doesn’t have the jump-
ing ability and strength that
Kreiger had,” said Timmons, “but
he is a better scorer. He has a__
good shot and can hit from any-_
where.” ’

With the aggressive defensive‘
play Timmons expects a lot 03*’
fouls called, and is worried. about
the thinness of his bench. “Our
bench isn’t What it was last year
and this could cause us a lot of
trouble, especially if some of our
boys have a lot of personal fouls.”

Let’s discuss tomorrow

In science and technology, the accomplishments
of today are‘ but direction for tomorrow. Why?

Simply because resting 011 the accomplishments
of today is a luxury we cannot afford.

In Communications Engineering, where
others are content to modify, our mandat_e

is to CREATE.

In Electronic Data Processing Systems,
where others are content to innovate, our

mandate is to CREATE.

This, then, is the philosophy . . . the crux of

intellectual thought . . . at the National Security
Agency——w/zero the concepts of tomorrow are the  —
problems of today. '

\

So let’s discuss the future...
yours and ours

If you are a gifted and interested Engineer or
Mathematician, we have much in common——including

A COMPULSION TO SUCCEED.

Our future is contingent upon a constant input of

new . . . and creative . . . scientiﬁc talent . . . the
lifeline of any institution. Our success is embodied

in the technical capabilities of our profes,s_ional staff. _ .___i .
To assure this, scientiﬁc employees are encouraged

to pursue graduatestudies at local universities 3

under Agency sponsorship. Your future with NSA

will entail education . . . early responsibility . . .

and unusually challenging assignments.

Why? Because . . .

0 We MUST create completely new kinds of
communications equipments and systems embodying
concepts and techniques THAT HAVE NO
PRECEDENT . . . antennas, transmitters, receivers
and terminal hardware of a most advanced design.

0 We MUST assure the complete invulnerability '— --_—
of message content through the novel . . . but never 7
static . . . science of cryptology.

0 We MUST develop special reﬁnements for
computers and electronic data processing systems

. . . experimenting with the latest semiconductors,
magnetic ﬁlm and superconductive devices to provide
new logic circuits and memory units for increased
speed and capacity.

Interested? .. . . If so, then LET’S DISCUSS
TOMORROW. Representatives of the National

. Security Agency will be on campus in the near future.
