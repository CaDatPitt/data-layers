at parade

Staﬁ” Wrz'ter

It’s not typical for a parade to
feature two grooms, one clad in
a white wedding dress spraying
rainbow confetti onto a crowd
from atop a red ﬂoat.

But Pittsburgh’s Pride Aware-
ness March isn’t your average
parade. '

The Pride Awareness March,
which began Downtown on the
Boulevard of the Allies at noon
and ended at Liberty Avenue, was
associated with the city’s annual
PrideFest, a day—long free unity
event to celebrate the lesbian,
gay, bisexual and transgender
community and its supporters.
The parade, which took place
on Sunday, June 10, featured 175
different groups equipped with
everything from a simple banner
to large, decorative ﬂoats.

In addition to drag queens
jamming to Neil Young songs and
scantily dressed people dancing
on ﬂoats, the parade also had
a more serious side. Pairs of
mothers marched with children,
straight couples and gay couples
marched side by side and almost
everybody was wearing some-

_ thing rainbow—colored.

This year’s PrideFest, which
included vendors, carnival games
and other entertainment, was the
largest Pittsburgh has ever seen,
with 75,000 people attending,
according to early city estimates.

Pitt reduces staff by more than 300 retirees

Josh Won
Szfaﬁ’ Wrz'ter '

More than 300 Pitt employees
have accepted an early retire-
ment offer that the University
put into effect April 24 in an ef-
fort to cut costs at the University
as a result of the decline in state
funding.

According to a press release
on Monday, the University’s Vol-
untary Early Retirement Plan was
extended to 672 employees who
have worked at the University

for at least 10 years and are at
least 59 years old. More than
500 employees could potentially
leave by the end of the month if
another 270 employees accept
the offer before thejune 15 dead—_
line. Because those employees
are classiﬁed, there is no way to
distinguish which University de-
partments they work in.

Pitt spokesman Robert Hill

said in an email that the Univer— ‘

sity did not set a specific goal or

expectation for how many eli— L

gible employees would take ad-

vantage of the early retirement
program, and he did not have an
estimate for how much money
the staff reductions would save
the University. . V

Hill said that employees tak-
ing advantage of the program
would receive “health and fi-
nancial beneﬁts,” but he did not
return a request for details on
the speciﬁc beneﬁts. .

Chancellor Mark Nordenberg
explained in the press release
that this retirement plan was
made in light of drastic funding

cuts from the state.

The National Science Board’s
“Science and Engineering Indica-
tors 2012” ranked Pennsylvania
to be among the ﬁve states with
the lowest appropriation of state
tax funds for supporting higher
education in the 2010 ﬁscal year,
but things have only gotten worse
since then.

During the 2012 ﬁscal year,
Pitt lost more than $67 million in
state support, due to a 22 percent

‘ reduction, an additional 5 per-

cent cut during the year, and a 50 percent
reduction in capital projects support.

Nordenberg said these ﬁnancial blows
are lamentable.

“Demand for the high- quality programs
provided by the University of Pittsburgh
has continued to rise dramatically, even
during the national economic downturn.
In fact, the work done at Pitt, both in edu-
cation and in research, has been one of the
key drivers of regional economic growth
and helped cushion western Pennsylvania
from the worst impacts of the recession,”
Nordenberg said. “As a result, this loss of
jobs not only is unfortunate for Pitt but is
bad news for the people of this region.”

Nevertheless, N ordenberg said the step
to reduce staffing with the Voluntary Early
Retirement Plan was unavoidable in‘ the
face of the budget cuts.

As for the future, the Chancellor re-
mains optimistic, with faith that state
funding and allowances will improve in
the years to follow.

“Fortunately, the state’s revenue pro-
jections have measurably improved since

that early February proposal was made,”
Nordenberg said, referring to the pro-
posed state budget. “There seems to be
strong and growing support to use some of
those funds to spare Pennsylvania’s public
universities from a second successive year
of deep and disproportionate cuts, and
we are hopeful that position will prevail
when the state budget is ﬁnally approved.”

But if such changes providing public
universities with-ﬁnancial relief are not
met, many schools might ﬁnd themselves
in a ﬁnancial quagmire. This, in turn,
could negatively affect the community.

“If the recommended reductions stand,
Pitt will have lost more than 50 percent of
its state support, well in excess of $100
million, in just two years,” Nordenberg
said. “That cannot be good, either for
today’s Pennsylvania families or for the
collective future of Pennsylvania.”

Hill said that further staff reductions
will depend on the state’s contribution to
the University’s budget.

“The University continues to advocate
in Harrisburgh [sic] for restoration of the
proposed appropriation cuts,” Hill said
in an email. “Plans regarding staff await
Harrisburgh [sic] decisions.” U

PRIDE

nized Pride Weekend since 2006, said it
is the f1fth—largest event that Pittsburgh

I holds.

Aside from the Pride Awareness March
and PrideFest, Pride Weekend also in-
cluded Pride in the Street, a large outdoor
party on Liberty Avenue the night before
the march featuring singer-songwriter
and lesbian icon Melissa Etheridge and
other musical acts.

Many of PrideFest’s more veteran par-
ticipants noted how far the event has come
since its inception. _ ,

Marv McGowan, 49, who was sporting a
Pittsburgh Pride March T-shirt from 1988,
said he could remember when the march
only attracted a few hundred people.

“People used to be afraid that someone
wouldesee them on TV, orwrite their name
in a school paper,” McGowan said.

Kim Rech, 32, who was celebrating her
ﬁfth pride weekend on Sunday, said she
could remember how sparsely attended
those early events were.

“Ten years ago it was just a bunch of gay
people walking around Shadyside, and now
it’s turned into this,” Rech said.

Another indicator of Pride Weekend’s
shift to the mainstream is its sponsors.
UPMC was a top-tier sponsor. Other spon-
sors included high—profile companies such
as Google, Starbucks and Coors Light.

Vendors of every kind packed Liberty
Avenue for five solid blocks. There were
the usual food vendors and carnival games,
but local businesses were also out in force
trying to create new customers and hand-

ing out applications.

“The Pride March gives organizations
and businesses an opportunity to show
their support for the LGBT community,”
Bryan said. I _

Jamie Scarano, UPMC’s director of in-
tegrated inclusion, agreed. She said that
UPMC was at PrideFest as part of their
Healthy Communities Initiative.

“These are our patients and employ-
ees,” Scarano said. “We’re out here to bring
awareness to UPMC’s LGBT initiatives.”

Signs of growing support for gay rights
in Pittsburgh showed prominentlyin re-

-cent days. Onjune 8, Mayor Luke Raven-

stahl announced that he joined Mayors
for the Freedom to Marry, a group in sup-
port of gay marriage. And onjune 12, City
Council named the date Sharon Needles
Day in honor of the popular Pittsburgh
drag performer and winner of “RuPaul’s
Drag Race.”

In 2011, Pittsburgh was ranked the
fifth-gayest city by Advocate Magazine,
a gay news publication. It has since fallen
to 19 on Advocate’s List, but those at the
PrideFest seemed to find the event impor-
tant to the LGBTQ community.

Pitt’s Rainbow Alliance participated in
the Pride March as well. They marched as
a small group with a blue banner that said
Rainbow Alliance in multicolored letters.

Rainbow Alliance president Tricia
Dougherty said her organization takes
part in the march every year.

“It’s a place where people go to feel
accepted,” she said, adding that the at-
mosphere of PrideFest frees Rainbow

Alliance members from censoring them- ‘

selves as they sometimes feel the need to
on campus. I

NAACP president delivers speech on racial profiling

Andrew Shull
News Editor

Benjamin Jealous didn’t shy away from
the city’s recent — and historic —~ high-
proﬁle incidents of police brutality against
young black men during a lecture on racial
proﬁling.

“Pittsburgh is a deeply segregated city,
with a notorious history of not holding
local law enforcement responsible, be it
Johnny Gammage or Jordan Miles, who
were punished for being young and black,”
he said after his speech.

Jealous, the president of the NAACP,
spoke to more than 500 people Thursday,
June 7, on the seventh ﬂoor of Alumni Hall
as part of the 10-year anniversary celebra-

tion of Pitt’s Center on Race and Social
Problems, which is part of the School of
Social Work. The Center on Race and So-
cial Problems was founded 10 years ago
to study the racial divides that plague so-
ciety.Jealous’ speech was titled “Trayvon
Martin: Racial Proﬁling and the Urgent
Need to Heal America.”

Johnny Gammage and Jordan Miles
were both young black men who were
the subjects of police beatings that drew
outrage from citizens. In Miles’ case in
early 2010, charges were never brought
against the ofﬁcers. The police ofﬁcers
were acquitted in Gammage’s case in 1995.

Jealous only rarely addressed the Tray-
von Martin shooting in Florida, instead
focusing on other cases that illustrated

the ineffectuality of racial profiling.

The first case he discussed was the D.C.
sniper, John Allen Muhammad, a black
man who, with a young partner, terrorized
Washington, D.C., by killing 10 people in
2002. Jealous said police ignored more
pertinent behavioral elements of the
proﬁle and instead focused on a part of
the profile that said the shooter would be
“probably white.”

Jealous said the police let him and his
young partner, who was also black, go after
stopping them nine times and never once
had them open their trunk, which served
as their sniper’s nest.

“As soon as race came up, the blinders
came on,”]ealous said.

He also used the example of a young

able to sneak box cutters, and even a prod-
uct that looked like C4 explosives, onto
airplanes.

Another case he pointed to was that of
Squeaky Fromme, the W0 man who nearly
assassinated then—President Gerald Ford.
Following her attempt, Jealous said the
Secret Service started searching women,
which Jealous said led to them thwarting
an attempt on George H. W. Bush’s life.

Finally, he used the example of James
Parker, a black man from Georgia who
tackled President William McKinley’s as-
sassin in 1901. Parker was mistaken for
an Eastern European. Jealous said that
at the time, it was thought that Eastern
European Anarchists would be the most

likely to carry out assassinations.

Jealous set out to prove that racial pro-
ﬁling is counterproductive, putting it into
context of the controversy surrounding
the New York Police Department’s “stop
and frisk” policy, which allows them to
stop and conduct a limited search, even
without probable cause.

“Ninety percent [of those searched]
are people of color. Ninety percent were
innocent. 99.99 percent had no gun,”]eal-
ous said, characterizing the practice as
“humiliating.” \

But the night wasn’t all about racial ‘

proﬁling. The attendees were also there
to celebrate the 10-year anniversary of-
the Center on Race and Social Problems.

“We a modern
version of Emmett
Till. This isn’t about
one black kid who
was slain.”

Ashley l\/lcCray NSBE

Academic Excellence Chair

Larry Davis, the dean of the School of
Social Work and director for the center,
used the opportunity to highlight the
center’s accomplishments, which include
holding the largest conference on race

 ,1.

   
  

relations in 2010 and hosting more than
100 guest lectures.

When Davis spoke after touting the
school’s accomplishments, he made an
indirect reference to the Trayvon Martin
killing.

“As the father of three boys,” he said,
“this is one of my biggest fears.”

Ralph Bangs, the associate director of
the Center on Race and Social Problems,
spoke after Davis to highlight the accom-
plishments of Pitt at large before Chancel-
lor Mark Nordenberg came on stage to
introduce Jealous. K

Speaking after his address, Davis rec-
ognized his white colleague, Bangs.

“Martin Luther King [Jr.] said there are
some white folks who are as dedicated to
seeing us free as We are to seeing ourselves
free,” Davis said. “Ralph Bangs is one of
those people.”

While the crowd was mostly made up of
older people, about 12 members of Pitt’s
chapter of the National Society of Black
Engineers showed up.

NSBE Academic Excellence Chair Ash-
ley McCray said before the lecture that
she thought Trayvon Martin’s case had a
historic parallel.

“It’s a modern version of Emmett Till,”
she said about a 14-year-old black boy
who was murdered in Mississippi in 1955
after allegedly ﬂirting with a white woman.
“This isn’t about one black kid who was
slain.’’

Olivia Gant, a Pitt sophomore and
another member of NSBE, echoed the
mission of the entire Center on Race and
Social Problems, saying: “To solve the
problem, you need to recognize it.”

“Trayvon Martin is just the tip of the
iceberg,” she said. I

Mitt —— ‘Latter-day Disguise’ yourself

Mitt Romney became universally likeable by creepily impersonating others.You can too! MCT Campus

The Pitt News retrieved the fol-
lowing from its TechnologyHelp
Desk junk folder:

Are you socially awkward?
Do college “friends” only put up
with your stiff, colorless nature
because you’re rich and have a
powerful dad‘? Do you often an-
noy fellow students by gleefully
talking about controlling them, in
such ways as ﬁring their parents
or becoming president?

If so, your once—hopeless
dreams of social acceptance are
now all but won. That’s because
you’re about to witness the ex-
traordinary “make-people-like-
you” capabilities of the newest
line of “Latter—day Disguises,” as
envisioned by presumptive nomi-
nee of the Republican Party for
president and cardboard-box-
look-alike Mitt Romney.

Back in boarding school and
at Stanford, Mitt was just as sad
as you — let’s say forcibly short-
ening people’s hair and trying to
make $10,000 bets inteenage
poker games cut into his friend
frontier. But that all changed for
Mitt once he developed the break-
through friend-making method

he’s allowing us to share with you

today.

In an immensely successful
effort to convince others of his
natural humor and charm, young
Mitt allegedly dressed up like a

police officer and pulled over '

drivers on the road, according
to witnesses quoted in The Na-
tional Memo and the Philadelphia
Inquirer. “Latter-day Disguises,”
brought to you by Bain Capital,
offers the chance for customers
to reach the level of universal, en-
thusiastic adulation now known
only for the former Massachu-
setts governor by tapping into

Mitt’s boyhood secret of stardom:
impersonating people of author-
ity.

Sure, it might be that young
Mitt’s supposed tasteful acts
of fun could be described as
“strange” or “creepy,” and that
impersonating police might af-
fect people’s safety and stress
levels more than their laughter.
But don’t let that faze you — en-
dangering your peers and raising
their eyebrows are the first steps
toward gaining their friendship.

And it’s that “demonic—to—
likable” pathway that forms the
gears driving our “Latter-day
Disguises” products. Based on

have the ability to understand
almost any subject. It’s been true
ever since there was a division
between the literate and illiter-
ate. Without a strong ability to
read, a person was ‘severely d_is-
advantaged in gaii1ing.knowl‘edge,
and we all know hat kfnowledge

I wanted to shout out  amen.
After all, I am aihugejproponeint
of reading. Ever sinceiIl'was'_,ijntro:l
duced to the wonder of “Captain
Underpants” books in elemen-
tary school, I’ve been hooked. The
subject matter.has changed, but I
can still be transported through

' literature like“I was when I was i

a child.

However, it became abun-

dantly clear that this particular
conversation was about how
young people don’t read any-

more. I ﬁrst hav:e.:_to stress that

today, we simply read in differ-
ent ways and different formats.
Regardless, I agree that we don’t
read enough. I do understand the

criticism though; like ‘everything.

else that our generation is blamed
for, there are some pretty good,

reasons that we don’t read.
Reason No. 1: TV is awesome.
Movies are awesome. Online
streaming is awesome. I know
that when Abraham Lincoln was
growing up, books were one of
the few forms of entertainment,

but c’mon! I guess that television I

wasn’t on 24 hours a day for many
of our parents. I get that DVRsys—
tems didn’t allow them to watch
literally every show on televi-
sion. And, although I really don’t
understand how, I can logically
deduce that older generations
couldn’t use Netﬂix. I know that
reality television might not power
our brains quite like a great novel,
but I do not believe for one second
thatanyone would rather spend
their night with Ernest ‘Heming-
way than Snooki. OK Woody Allen,
I guess you made a movie about
people who would rather do that
(“Midnight in Paris”), but isn’t
that ‘my point? I’d rather watch a

. movie about wanting to hang out

with people that wrote books that

. people used to read than actually
"read it. I can Wikipedia those lit-

erary references anyway.

Reason No. 2: When and where
am I supposed to read‘? Between
school, work and homework, I
have a hard time justifying read-
ing for fun. If I’m going to be
sitting in my room going over a
book, I mightas well make it a
textbook and get something out
of it that will go on a transcript,
right‘? In this time—compressed
world that we live in, it’s very dif-
ficult to pick the 300-page book
over the 90-minute movie.

I tried to maximize my down
time to get some good reading in.
I started trying to read on a Port
Authority bus. Have you ever ac-
tually traveled in a bus? Between
bumps in the road, the 30 people
crowding on top of me and the fact
that I have to stand for the entire
ride, buses are not conducive to
reading. I then tried to do it on the
walk to class. That just ended with
lots of angry south Oaklanders
and ‘injured j oggers. I ﬁnally gave
a valiant attempt to do some read-
ing while shaving which, as you
might imagine, ended in disaster
andblood spill.

Professors, have I not con-

vinced you? The truth is that
some of the best times of my life
have been shared with Harry Pot-
ters and Holden Caulﬁelds. My
experiences in Pittsburgh have
been inspired by Michael Chabon.
And the hard times in my life have
their characters and authors as
well.

I can’t say that I entirely blame
my peers for watching, rather
than reading, “Game of Thrones.”
I understand where they come
from because we’ve all been there.
I, for one, want to change that. I
don’t care if it’s on a Kindle, Nook,
hardcover, paperback, magazine,
website, cell phone or any of the
limitless options available to us -
I am going to make a greater effort
to read. I’m going to take it out on
the bus and sneak a page before
bed. I’m going to go through the
good and the bad with the char-
acters that remind me that we are
all much more alike than not. I’m
going to read, and you should too.

CONCERT REVIEW

Pittsburgh’s Girl Talk rocks sold-out crowd at Stage

Andrew Gretchko
S taff Writer

For an artist of such fame, it would be
easy to sitback, press play and watch
the rave unfold in the crowd. Luckily,
Girl Talk had other plans.

Taking the ﬂoor at Stage AE on
Saturday nightbelowalooming net of
multicolored balloons hanging from
the top of the outdoor stage, the na-
tive Pittsburgh mashup artist wasted
no time turning the sold-out show
into a huge, outdoor dance party.

He pressed one button after an-
other on his computer, following
a few short tweaks on the sound-

board in front of him, and without
giving the crowd a moments notice,
the large twin columns of speakers
erupted with a collection of pop hits
from both past and present. Girl Talk
mixed artists from Tyga to Nicki
Minaj to Rick Springﬁeld, creating
a new experience for his fans in the
crowd.

In a well—orchestrated display of
stage presence, the blaring music
triggered the release of the balloons,
sending them ﬂoating into the crowd
below that respondedwith a collec-
tive roar of approval and began its
nearly two-hour—long dance mara-
thon.

Known for his ability to blend
tracks from across all genres into
a massive musical conglomerate,
Gregg Gillis — more commonly
known as Girl Talk-— is best deﬁned
as a mashup artist. While each of his
many works are original, they are all
solely made up of others’ tracks, cre-
ating a seamless string of sound that
makes each individual track almost
indistinguishable.

While Girl Talk’s mashup albums
have received critical acclaim from
The New York Times and Rolling
Stone, they have also been called a
lawsuit waiting to happen. After all,
isn’t making money off others work
illegal? Girl Talk, however, continues
to argue otherwise.

Releasing his work under the
record label Illegal Art, Girl Talk
believes that sampling music is a
fair practice used across virtually
all genres of music. The record label
has a slew of other mashup artists
under its belt,  of which have
also comeunderﬁre fortheir music-

making techniques.

>' All controversy and copyright

Talkfansfdressed in neon clothes that
ﬂooded the outdoor venue cou1dn’t

have cared less about the drama
that often circulates around the D].
Welcoming a large group from the
audience onto the stage, Girl Talk
was quickly surrounded by a mob of
partying fans that soon included the
DJ himself as he joined in with those
around him on the stage.

Unlike many Djs, Girl Talk re-
fused to stand behind his MacBook
and leave the excitement to the fans.
Instead, the white-T—shirt—and—head-
band—clad Pittsburgh-native 30 -year—
old could be seen jumping around
on stage, both hands in the air as he
weaved in and out of those dancing
on stage next to him.

He didn’t act like a revered su-
perstar, exempt from joining in on
the fun of those below him in the
crowd. This D] was a pivotal part of
the event, keeping the energy level
high as he mounted an on—stage
speaker to show his loyalty to those
who paid to see their hometown DJ
perform. At the end of the show, he
thanked the crowd of Pittsburghers
for its support.

Even for those who had never
heard any of Girl Talk’s work prior
to the show, the concert featured art-
ists from Busta Rhymes to Herbie
Hancock, providing something for
every concertgoer.

Starting with a string of tracks

from his popular album Nzg/.21‘ Rz]>-
per, the concert saw the D] change
gears and play bits and pieces of the
2008 Feed the Animalr, as Well as the
2010 release All Day! -— an album
so popular that its release slowed
down numerous servers across the
web from eager downloaders, and
prompted MTV to run the headline
“Girl Talk Apologizes for Breaking
the Internet.”

The success of All Dqy even
prompted the Pittsburgh City Council
to declare December7th “Gregg Gillis
Day.” Success has many deﬁnitions,
but a holiday named in your honor
has got to be at the top of the list.
He has his own holiday, and he still
knows how to show his fans a good
time.  ._‘ A ,

Let’s face it: Girl Talk

Remixes offer alternative to
mainstream music

 
 
  
  
  
  
 
  
     

 

.

.; I. ' MCT,Campus

Kayla Sweeney
I/VET S Contributor

I » Subparremixes of mainstream indie
songs seem to circulate everywhere. In
various Pittsburgh shops and establish-
 , rnents, speakers blare a variety of re-
‘ ' mixed music, creating a clublike scene
that may or may not represent the music
that shoppers actually enjoy listening to.
But one thing is certain: Remixes are
everywhere, and it doesn’t look like they
are going to stop popping up anytime
soon. It may be interesting to delve
into the large and unending sphere of
remixes, and today there are mashed-
up versions of almost everything. Who
knew that we lived in aworld where both
a moombahton remix of “Rack City” and
a dubstep remix of “The Star—Spangled
Banner” exist?
The issue of the omnipresence of re-
mixes doesn’t exist solely as a discussion
on whether or not these songs improve

the original song or not. It also begs the '

question of the ethical components re-
garding this aspect of the music industry.

Are we OK with paying and sup-
porting artists for creations that aren’t
wholly original? The answer seems to be
a resounding yes. Last Friday, mashup
artist and Pittsburgh native Girl Talk
played a sold-out show at Stage AE’s
outdoor venue.

For those unfamiliar with Girl Talk
— Gregg Gillis’ pseudonym —— he’s an
artist especially skilled at splicing songs,
which include everything from top-40
hip-hop to 80s pop hits, and combining
them into club—ready tunes that actually
sound good.

  

And he’s not the only one. Other
7 mashup artists, such as The White
"' ‘Panda and The Hood Internet,
9 have achieved a cult Internet fol-
} lowing by creating mashup mix-
‘ tapes that are usually available for
free download online.

It’s obvious that the rise of

technology,‘ the Internet and
f their inﬂuence on music. Sites

' ' aggregate the most-blogged about
--=-\ new tracks ﬂoating around the

. tions dedicated to remixes alone.
Today, the chance of encoun-
tering a new track on Pitchfork
tliat"i_s a rernixhis higher than ever.
Andjwith the rise of skilled mixers and

 blogosphere — have entire sec-

 I

_ producers, such asClams Casino, who

have the ability to completely transform
 (see his‘_remi_'x‘of Washed Out’s
“Arrr‘r)rl}'17ati”, for a stellar example), this

increase in popularremixes isn’t neces— A

sarilyabadthing. I ' I

However, for every great remix of a
song. that makes its .way to the blogo-
sphere, there’s;2O homemade dubstep
remixes ofthe exact same track. There
is a ridiculous number of remixing and
digital music editing software available
online (sometimes for free), all of which
allows people who aren’t in the music
industry to create amateur remixes and
mashups from their computers at home.

These in-home “musicians” then
stream tracks to sites like SoundC1oud
that allow them to upload their cre-
ations to the .Intemet in the hope that
the blogosphere will pay them some at-
tention. In other words, basically any-
one with a little knowledge of music and
technology can become an entry-level
producer.

But, should we encourage this kind of
behavior? It’s easy to argue that every-
thing is just a derivative of something
else, just as easy as it is to say that artists
such as Flo Rida shouldn’t be making
millions off a song that samples a song
that samples another song (the “Incep-
tion” of sampling, if you will).

It wouldn’t be right to restrict re-
mixing and mashups solely to famous
producers, and in the end, this isn’t so
much an issue of unoriginality in music
as it is merely a realization of the shift in
the direction of today’s music.

In a digital age where nothing is new,
artists that can create something origi-
nal out of already released music will
stand out in the industry. I

FlLM REVIEW

‘Roe/e ofAges’ entertains with a
lively soundtrack l

Anna Weldon
A€9’E Editor

“Rock of Ages"

Directed by: Adam Shankman

Starring: Julianne Hough, Diego Boneta
and Tom Cruise

Grade: B+

Inone year, every high schoolwillbe performing
“Rock of Ages” as their annual musicals. And
every conservative school board member will
be shrilling in contempt at the suggestive nature
of the material.

But what the newly adapted Broadway musi-
cal shows its audiences is that nothing can keep
ﬁom spreading the wonderful debauchery of
rock ‘n’ roll; I .

A compilation of ’8os classics, a dynamic
stripper scene and a lot of tongue are all it takes
to make “Rock ofAges” an entertainingﬁlm. The
movie shows how every wide—eyed blonde ﬁ'om
Oklahoma can leave their hometowns for a life
of whiskey, cut-off shorts and rock ‘n’ roll. The
movie features afew all-star actors in the diverse
cast to resurrect the ’8os and its very intense
music culture. ..

SetinLos Angeles in198z “Rock of Ages’ ’ fol-
lows Oklahoma native Sherrie (Julianne Hough)
on her adventurous ﬂeeﬁom small-townlife. She
travels inhopes ofbecoming astar, and like many

. naive hopefuls who search for stardom, Sherrie

ﬁnds a job as a waitress. ‘She begins working at
the Bourbon Room, a popular LA nightclub, on
her way to fame as a singer.

UponarrivalinLA, Sherrie meets Drew(Diego
Boneta), another starry-eyed singer who also
works at the nightclub, and the two immediately
hit it off. After just one week of gut-wrenching
power ballads, they fall in love, just in time for
rock legend Stacee_Iaxx’s (Tom Cruise) ﬁnal per-
formance with his band, Arsenal.

Asasuperstar, Staceejaxxhas gainedareputa-
tion for his stuck-up behavior; alcohol and drug
abuse, and a complete disregard forwomen. With
his fur coat and super—low-rise leather pants, he
elicits swoons from everyone he passes, whether
out of attractiveness orhisethanol-inﬁrsed breath.

As with all musicals, the randomly inspired
outbursts of song come at shocking moments,
creatingasort offorced musicianship throughout
the ﬁlm. But as the movie continues, each ’8os
classic becomes more anticipated, and soon the

audience expects screeching guitars and banging

    

MC Campus

drums over the normal dialogue.

“Rock of Ages” exploits a number of stereo-
types that society has grown to accept. A small-
town girl, her wannabe-rock—star boyfriend and
a sell—out rock god are justafew of the trademark

personality types that are featured in the movie. 

A conservative band of women work to ﬁght
offwhat theybelieve to be the sinful nature of rock
‘n’ roll music by taking down the Bourbon. But;
even group leader Patricia Whitrnore (Catherine
Zeta-Jones), the feisty wife of the mayorwho high
kicks her legs in a peach dress suit, falls slave to l
the mysteriously appealing nature of Staceejaxx.

Though some of theacting seems a bit over-
wrought, it also ﬁts the ﬂamboyant style of a
broadway musical. Actors such as Zeta—Jones,
Cruise and Mary]. Bligebringentertainingperfor—
mances to “Rock of Ages,” despite the ridiculous

nature of their characters. “"'

Musically, the movie does not disappoint
audiences hopeful for a conglomeration of ’8os
classics. The soundtrackto“RockofAges”isﬁlled
with hits from classic ’8os rockbands, including
Journey, Guns N’ Roses and Pat Benatar, blending
a solid mix of past big—haired superstars.

One of the opening tracks mashes Foreigners
‘fluke Box Hero” withJoan]ett’s “I Love Rock ’n
Ro ” which forms a great combination of two
well-known songs. The actors intheﬁlmcomrnit
so ﬁilly to their characters that it almost seems
normal for them to break out in head—banging
songs duringtheir day-to-day activities. ' 

Probably the most memorable moment of
the movie comes in the strip club when Mary].
Blige’s character leads agroup ofhalf-naked girls
and their male pursuers in an impressive dance
routine that demonstrates the athleticism of the
performers. Despite the comedically suggestive
nature of the movements, the routine warrants
some respect because of its extreme diﬂiculty.

But this might be the pinnacle of “Rock of
Ages.” Mary J. Blige is by far the most talented
musical artist in the movie, and she delivers a
stellar performance. And while the rest of the__
ﬁlm is certainly entertaining, the movie is not
a cinematic masterpiece, so viewers should go
looking for a good laugh and some great music.

“Rock of Ages’ ’ even makes a cultural critique
on the cultural transitionﬁpm rock ‘n’ roll to soul-
ful boy bands. When Drew gets wrapped up in a

boy band, Sherrie remarks that his selling out is ’=*

worse than her stripping.

But somehow the ensemble continues to rock,
and after a few challenges, every hopeful starlet
has their time for fame. And with all of that voice
straining, viewers can only thank the rock gods
forAuto-Time.

Season ends for Panthers

after disappointing trip

RJ Sepich
Sports Editor

The Pitt athletics 2011-2012 sea-
son ﬁnally ended last weekend
when the track and ﬁeld team’s
campaign concluded at the NCAA
Outdoor Championships in Des
Moines, Iowa.

But disappointingly for the

seven Panthers who qualiﬁed for

1 the final meet of the season, none
of them advanced to the ﬁnals in
their respective events.

On June 6, the Pitt women’s
400-meter relay team, made up
of juniors Ashley Woodford,Jon-
nique Lawrence, Arielle Fonrose
and senior Cambrya Jones, was
disqualiﬁed in the preliminary
round of the event, while senior

 ..;’—men’s sprinterjermaine Lowery
finished 22nd in the 4oo—meter

V.-hurdles with a time of 52.23 sec-
onds.
“We just had a mix-up with the
hand-off [of the baton],” Jones
said of the mistake that led to

Pitt’s Cambrya Jones (1004) narrowly missed advancing to the NCAA

 to NCAA Championships

Pitt’s disqualiﬁcation. “It’s un-
fortunate, but it happens some-
times.”

That same day,Jones also nar-
rowly missed making the ﬁnals
in the 10o—meter dash as she ﬁn-
ished in 10th place with a time of

11.33 seconds. Only eight runners .

made the ﬁnals of each event.

But on Thursday, Jones still
had hopes of qualifying for the
ﬁnals in her best event, the
200-meter dash.

“It was disappointing to just
miss the ﬁnals of the 100-meter
[dash] ,” she said. “But I was still
conﬁdent that I would advance in
the 200-meter because that’s my
best event.” ’ 7 "

Despite being the No. 3 seed

in the event,Jones struggled and .

once again just failed to advance
to the ﬁnals. She ﬁnished in ninth
place after ﬁnishing in 22.76 sec-
onds.

The Pittsburgh Pirates are in ﬁrst
place.

That’s right, for the second
year in a row, the Pirates ﬁnd
themselves in playoff contention
inJune.

Although last season’s squad
fell apart down the stretch, its
strong play through the ﬁrst half

- — resulting in a brief stint atop the

National League Central Division
standings —-— gave fans hope that
better times were on the horizon,
despite the franchise’s ongoing 19-
year streak of losing seasons.

So far in 2012, the Bucs are
showing even more promise than
they did last year. And the root of
all this current success comes from
a place that does not receive the
credit it deserves: the same front
ofﬁce that Pirate fans have loved
to hate for the past 19 years.

Pirates’ risks beginning to pay off

ries against Baltimore this week,
the Pirates ﬁnd themselves tied
with the Cincinnati Reds for ﬁrst
place in the division with a record
of 32-27, and the team is coming
off its ﬁrst interleague sweep in a
decade after defeating the Kan-.
sas City Royals in three straight
contests. Currently in the midst
of a 12-3 stretch, the Pirates also
boast baseball’s best record since
May 25. _

The record itself demonstrates
an improvement over last season.
Through the same amount of
games in 2011, the Pirates found
themselves" more than six games
back of ﬁrst place with a record
of 29-30.

Led by blossoming young stars

like outﬁelder Andrew McCutchen

and starting pitcherjames McDon-

because some fans insist upon
holding onto an attitude profess-

and a desire to knock the Pirates’
front office at every opportunity.
Yes, there were some bad
trades in the past that were made
for ﬁnancial, not talent reasons.

And yes, there have been some .

questionable free—agent signings
that may have conveyed an attitude

After having to wait overnight

against the No. 1-ranked player

Djokovic went on to win the
next eight games to take the third
set and gain a 2-1 lead in the fourth
set. With the match looking des-

tined for a decisive ﬁfth set, the

rains came again and forced a
postponement until the next day.
When play resumed Monday,

. Nadal broke Djokovic’s serve in

the ﬁrst game to even the fourth

tington’s best skill as a general manager isn’t

in signing veteran free agents, but rather.

in developing a younger, more promising
group of players.

Huntington’s efforts at restocking the
Pirates’ minor league system through scout-
ing and the Major League Baseball Draft

A is leading a change in attitude around the ’

franchise that is necessary for the Pirates
to become a contender again.

Recently, during this year’s draft, the
organization sent a message to the rest of
the league‘ as a result of that attitude: regard-
less of the situation, the Pittsburgh Pirates
are not afraid to choose the best prospects
available. '

As a result,.the Pirates used their ﬁrst-
round pick on Stanford right-handed pitcher
Mark Appel, a man considered by many to
be the best overall prospect in the draft.

The reason Appel fell to the Pirates at

The bottom line

in baseball is that’
winning teams
take chances,

and the Pi rates .
are beginning

to take those
chances.

_No. 8 overall is most likely attributed to
the pitcher’s agent, Scott Boras. Boras has
become infamous throughout baseball with
his hard-bargaining ways, and he seemingly
always manages to wiggle a few extra million
dollars out of teams for his clients’ services,

making him a major thorn in the collective
side of owners’ pocketbooks around the

_ league.

This scenario reminds me of a similar
situation that occurred a few years ago with
current Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim
pitcherjered Weaver. 0 ‘

As,I was living in California at the time,
I remember watching Weaver, then a star
pitcher at Long Beach State University, and

' thinking how great it would be if he would
be‘ drafted by the other baseball team I love, 2

the Angels.

Unfortunately, I knew that was very un-
likely to happen since he was such a world-
class talent on the mound,.and the Angels
did not pick until the No. 12 slot in the draft.’
But the draft progressed, and Weaver kept
dropping until the Angels picked at No. 12
and nabbed him. From there, he has become
arguably one of the best pitchers in baseball.

Like Appel, Weaver was, and still is,
represented by Boras and fell in the draft
because of it. But the Angels took a chance
on signing him — as the Pirates did this

year with Appel —— and, after managing to
come to an contract agreement with Boras
and Weaver, were rewarded mightily for
their opportunistic draft choice.

The bottom line in baseball is that win-
ning teams take chances, and the Pirates are
beginning to take those chances.

In fact, Pittsburgh’s two best players at
the moment, McDonald and McCutchen, are
results of management taking chances on
young, talented players who easily could’ve
failed.

McDonald was acquired via trade from
the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2010 with an-
other prospect in exchange for the Pirates’
best relief pitcher, Octavio Dotel. At the
time of the trade, McDonald was relegated

‘to bullpen duty for the Dodgers and owned a

horrendous 8.22 earned run average. Today,
McDonald sports a crisp ERA of 2.39 —
sixth-best in the majors — with 73 strike-
outs in 75.1 innings pitched, a WHIP (walks
and hits allowed per innings pitched) of
1.00, and he is the unquestionable ace of
the Pirates’.pitching staff, as well as a likely
choice for the National League All—Star team.

McCutchen was also a product of chance,
with the Pirates drafting him No. 11 over-
all in the 2005 Draft, despite McCutchen
already signing on to play baseball for, the

. University of Florida. But the Pirates con-

vinced him to join the professional ranks,
and now McCutchen, who recently signed
a new 6-year, $51.5 million contract with
the team, is hereto stay as the face‘ of this
Pirates franchise. ’
With his .325 batting average, 11 home
runs and 36 runs batted in so far this«sea-
son, McCutchen is even beginning to garner
some early mentions across ‘baseball for
this season’s Most Valuable Player award.
‘ More recently, Huntington and the Pi-

rates have taken risks by selecting players 4

like Pedro Alvarez, Gerrit Cole, Josh Bell

_ and Jameson Taillon in the draft. Each of _

these players were surrounded with red

, ﬂags stating they would be difﬁcult to sign

for the team brave enough to take achance

"on them. But Huntington struck several

last-minute deals to lock each one of them
up, and he continues to brighten the Pirates’

, future outlook with this strategy.

In the hopeful event that Appel signs with
Pittsburgh and thanks to. the risks _Hunting-
ton has taken, Pirates fans can likelylook
forward to a potentially dominant pitching
rotation consisting of McDonald, Taillon,
Cole and Appel some time in the near future.

There no longer is a debate‘ about it —
this franchise is committed to winning.

The risks taken in trades andxdrafts by
the Pirates’ front ofﬁce, the. efforts to sign‘
key players like McCutchen to long-term
contracts and the hiring of anxelxperienced,
charismatic manager like’ Clint Hurdle all
have Pittsburgh’s baseball team 4 ﬁnally
headed in the right direction.

It may be another two orjthree years until
the Pirates contend for ,chan1pionships, but.
there is legitimate hope that‘thlesel—Pirates
are on the verge of becoming one of the great
teams in baseball once again.

“She wanted to have a great senior year
and she was very focused all season. I’m
really proud of her efforts, and she set the
standard on what is expected now.”

Later this month, Jones will travel to the
USA Olympic Team Trials in Eugene, Ore.,
to try and earn a trip to the 2012 Summer
Olympics in London this August.

“I’m excited to compete against such
talented runners once again,” she said. “I

Regardless of who wins, one thing is
certain: The stage is set for these two tennis
greats to compete for major tournament
titles for many years to come. I

Freshmanjosh Thompson was the ﬁnal
Panther to be eliminated from the meet
after he ﬁnished 22nd in the 11o—meter
hurdles with a time of 14.12 seconds.

“This was a great experience for
[Thompson] to build on,” Webb said. “He’s
