Sobotd

Before attempting to reorganize
Student Government, Rich So-
bota, independent presidential
candidate for SG, suggested that
SPA examine the purpose of a
three branch system of govern-
merit.

Commenting on SPA’s proposal
that all senators be included in
the Executive committee, Sobota
said, “Setting; up an organization
which functions both as a repre-
sentative body and as an execu-
tive committee defeats the con-
cept of a legislative, and execu-
tive, and a judicial system of gov-
ernment;

“Iniorder for SG to function.
properly, no one branch " should
be bogged down with the mat-
ters of another.”

Inadequate Voice

«Sobota also feels that such a..

policylwould necessarily narrow
the base of lead_ership, thereby
centering power in the hands of a
few. I '
In order that the members of
the Senate can respond to the
demands of their respective
constituencies, Sobota suggested
the possibility of establishing
centers where students could
submit petitions as recommen-
dations to their representative.
As for represnetation in the
Senate. Sobota feels that the pre-

The platforms of Fulton and
Sobota are nothing but “pure
nonsense” according to SG presi-
dential candidate Richard Ros-

enzweig.
“Fulton, with his dreamy pro-

jects for ‘progressive’ reform of}

student government, represents to
us a poorly -informed talking ma-
chine with little in the way of
leadership to offer to student gov-
ernment,” he said.

Rosenzweig added that Sobota.
has offered nothing constructive,
but has only complained about
political party maneuvering.

“We of the ACP are not pro-
posing drastic changes in the Con-
stitution or blaming the state of
student government on its struc-
ture,” Rosenzweig said.

Rosenzweig stated that the SG
will not be limited to a small
clique as the SPA proposes, but
that official representatives-froim
all campus groups will be ap-
pointed “to come before the Sen-
ate and have a voice.”

“In short, we plan to rally the
entire student body to a spirited
pursuit of a more meaningful

college experience,” he con-
cluded, “by facilitating group
cooperation for the common

beneﬁt of all students.”
The ACP slate is as follows:
Senior Senators: Linda Lee --

The schools represented are Nursing. Bus-
iness Administration, Education, Engineer-
ing and Mines, Liberal Arts, Pharmacy and

and Professional Schools.

In order to vote, a student must present
his invoice. The elections will be run in a
manner similar to the mock presidential

last November.

ISPAP  I .

 In answer to Dick Sobota’s
lcharge that certain persons have
{been confusing the SIG campaign,
2 Bob Fulton has reminded him that
lsince the founding of the SPA it
:has presented to the public the
same slate for president and vice-
? president. ‘

“If Mr. Sobota. is going to sling
mud, he should be quite sure that
he is slinging it in the right di-
rection. ‘

“While Sobota seems to feel thab
most of the candidates running
for election are striving only to
win individual success and not
an improved student government,
he does not say how he intends to
make student government a suc-
* cess.” 

Challenges Sobota

Fulton believes that the best
means of arousing -student inter-
est in SG is to put on a success-
ful campaign and to sponsor can-
didates who are willing to give
their time and effort to SG.

He challanged Sobota to pub-
licly review his attendance rec-
ord .as Junior Senator on the

 present senate. “If he is proud
l of this record, I feel sure that
he will present it to the students
as one of his qualiﬁcations.”
Fulton also said that candidates
‘should formulate in their minds

Announced for Baldwin Schools

By MARION BERGSTEIN

The university and

the

Baldwin-Whitehall Public

School District have announced plans for a summer pro-
gram in teacher education from June 26 to«.August 5.
The program’ will be conducted by public school teachers

under the directionvof university faculty members at the

Highlands Elementary School in Baldwin-Whitehall.

“Understanding Other Peoples’

and Their Ways of Life in Rela-
tion to Our Waysof Life” is the
theme. ,

Children will be organized on
a non-graded basis and regard-
less of age.

Four Divisions

The plan is in four divisions:

graduatecourses for teachers and
administrators, special program in
teacher education for graduates of
liberal arts colleges, two lecture
series, and a summer school for
elementary school age children.
Graduate courses will teach
new ways in organizing schools,
planning curriculum develop-
ments. grouping children, utiliz-
ing teachers’ timeyand employ-
ing new instructional materials.

adequate voice for all schools of
the university.

“Upon analysis of the docu-
ment itself,” be said. “I ‘have
found that, for some reason or
other, no mention whatsoever is
made of the schools of Engineer-
ing & Mines and Busines.; Ad-
ministration.”

Furthermore, Sobota. claimed
that the system for selecting
senators at large indicated a’
class distinction, which he felt
should not exist. Instead, Sobota
proposes an equal number of
senators for each class.

With regard to representation
.in the various schools, he felt that
some sort of proportional repre-
sentation should be adopted, in
order that those schools having
larger enrollment might have a
greater voice in student govern-
ment.

you for your show of interest in

altered, as advisors are prone to

 Probclem Time

Registration time is here again. The word automatically

A is associated with problems. This year there are several new
ones. I

The main one concerns students who are planning to
attend both the Spring and Fall trimesters of this year.
These students were not given the opportunity to inform
administrators what courses they will need in the Fall.

According to the Ofﬁce of Educational Planning, the
courses that are tolbe offered in the Fall were determined
by the courses listed on the course selection card which all
students ﬁlled out last November. The time schedule booklet
for the Fall had to be printed now for the beneﬁt of all
who would not be attending in the Spring.

C But students attending the Spring trimester had no
voice in suggesting what courses should be offered in the
Fall. This happened because on the course selection card
that all students" ﬁlled out during registration last Novem-
ber, there was only one column provided, tovrepresent
choice for the nextterm attending, S

Since this space had to beiused for the courses, they

would be taking -in the Spring, they missed the boat con-

cerning what courses should be offered in the Fall.

. ‘ This could be harmful to the student who. expects to
graduate in December, but ‘realizes he can’t because the
courses he needs are not being offered. The only solution to
this problem will be for students to ﬁll out their schedules
on a yearly basis.

Another point that can be mentioned concerning regis-
tration, applies only to the students who are not attending
the Spring trimester this year. When a student pursues a
higher education he does not always know what his major
ﬁeld will be. If a student must decide in February what
courses he will take seven months later, we can’t convince
ourselves that he should be charged a fee for changing his
mind during that period. ‘

The argument that the paper work _involved in many
oﬂices demands that this fee should be charged, seems
rather weak. The student has a right to change his mind
in a period of that length no matter how much paper work
it involves. 4 ' '

    Ensuing . Crisis : 

By Harriet Wehner
On November 19, _1958,—Nikita Khrushchev is-
sued an ultimatum calling for the withdrawal of
the Western garrison from Berlin in order to create
a “Free City” in West Berlin. The Western allies

would not accept this ultimatum since they knew"

they would be delivering Berlin
into the hands of the East Ger-

man Communists who do not_
bother to hide their intention
of swallowing this section

eventually.

Khrushchev’s dogmatic state-
ment to the Western nations was
never enforced, and in order to
save face, the Communist lead-
ers placed petty restrictions on
commerce across the East German border. I ,

As recently as last Monday these restrictions
were removed. The Communist leaders, who had
passed the law forcing all West Berliners to obtain
special “day passes” each time they entered East
Berlin, received heavy criticism from both the West
Germans and Western Allies. This criticism seemed
to be the force that caused the Communist leaders
to repeal the law. '

It wil be interesting to see if this apparently
repeating cycle (making dogmatic statements
arousing the people and then backing down) takes
place concerning their most recent assertion to the
United Nations which calls for the dismissal of the

.Secretary General, Dag Hammarskjold, and the

expulsion of all Belgian personnel from the Congo.

Honor Tap

By Trudy Weiss

Students in a large university such as ours

often complain about being just a number on ﬁle ~

in the records of the Dean’s ofﬁce. Very often

‘these complaints _are justiﬁed: there are always

those who are dissatisﬁed enough to complain, but
not dissatisﬁed enough to do A-
something outstanding in order
to raise themselves above the
status of the average‘ college stu-
dent. «
Even in a large university,
however, there are ways to be-
come a Name instead of a Num-
ber. And recognition is readily
given to the Names, both by fel-
low students and by. administra-
tors. J "

  
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 

Tap Day is a traditional way of recognizing and 5

honoring students who have derrfonstrated scho-
lastic achievement, and leadership or s'ignif'ican’t
participation‘ in. campus activities. I‘ .

. — One day is set aside each Spring to ‘tap’ deserv-
ing men and women in the freshman through se-
nior classes into honorary societies whose member-
ship is based upon performance rather than prefer-
ence. In deciding upon a student to be tapped, hon-
oraries generally consider, in addition to the stu-

  

 

reason given for the attack on the United Nations,

The criticism against this demanding proposal
is overwhelming. President John F. Kennedy pledg-
ed that the U. S. would defend the Charter of the
United Nations by opposing any attempt by any
government to intervene unilaterally in the Congo,
He said quite dramatically that this intervention
by one country would bring with it the “risks of
war.” ,

Hammarskjold also told Soviet Union represen-
tatives at the UN that he would not be driven out
of his post when the world organization was at one
of its most crucial moments. I

The situation in Africa is very similar to that
of the one in Berlin. But possibly in Africa it is
even more crucial, since the people in that area are
not as economically and educationally advanced.
The Negroes, who have relentlessly stood by Lu-
mumba, will be easier to sway both to mob vio..
lence and to communist theories than the Germans
were.

Kennedy’s position in this situation and Eisen- ’

hower’s position in the Berlin crisis differ only in
degree of seriousness. But if Khrushchev and the
other more rational communist leaders think that
the majority of nations are going to risk war to
stop this unilateral intervention in the Congo, we
can count on the so-called powerful Soviet leaders

Tap Day originated 34 years ago as apart of

Tap Day has always been a digniﬁed and sol-

lead.ers, have somewhat altered the policies for
their particular Tap Day (some committees have
given minor sports letters to cheerleaders, but the

For Sale — Cheap

By Chuck Dunbar

Madison Avenue has had many problems in its
day, but we have been wondering lately what
would happen if the tight gray—suited ad men were
given the job of selling the university. By this we
mean selling the school to prospective freshmen.

Think back: what’ inﬂuenced you to come to
Pitt? Perhaps it was money or I
closeness to home. But times are
changing andithe university is
trying to lure a new kind of stu-
dent to its doors. The old reasons
which dictated your decision no
longer stand; the school is faced
with the problem of ﬁnding a
new drawing card.

Pitt wants a different market.
The old streetcar commuter is to .
be replaced by the ultimate in college students,
the Ivy League stereotype with the Jack Kennedy
haircut. This young man-of-the-world with his
drab corduroy suit and tight—ﬂtting' vest is the
chief target of the ad man’s sales pitch.

Realizing that this new dimension,‘this “chang-
ing image,” desires Ivy "League atmosphere, the
ad man draws up his approach. Here’s what we
think it would be like. _

First of all, he would play up the scenic beauty
of our “campus.” Everyone knows all college cam-
puses are beautiful, and the university is no excep-
tion (if we can believe the ad man). Located in the
heart of Pittsburgh’s civic center, it is surrounded
by such points of interest as Forbes Field, Schenley

 

\

   

Park (the city’s ﬁnest), the Medical Center, and
historic Oakland.

By careful omission our Madison Avenue pro-
tege neglects some important details, as is the cus-
tom in his trade. Forbes ‘Field and Oakland, far
from being colorful, present a rather dirty picture,
while Schenley Park seems miles away when com-
pared to the proximity of. the rest of the surround-
ing area. , , C

He would also cite the Cathedral of Learning
as being the tallest structure in the world devoted
to knowledge. Here is a pitch that would appeal to
the applicant. Americans want everything bigger.
and bettergand the Cathedral is truly bigger (and
different). Just imagine, the highest spire of its
kind in the world, a symbol of the spirit of learn-
mg.

Naturally, our friend, the ad man, would use
elliptical prose in his description, casually over-
looking such facts as after years and years of usage
the Cathedral still remains to be ﬁnished.

Why just think of all the bigger and better ‘

things Pitt has; the tallest stained glass windows in
the world are in Heinz Chapel, the hills of the engi-
neering campus are exceeded in steepness by per-

haps only the University of California’s Berkeley‘

campus. And our tuition is still growing, threaten-
ing to reach monstrous proportions.

But let us drop this cynicism and hope our good ‘

fellow is successful in his endeavor to sell the uni-
V9I‘Si'€y to the Ivy Leaguers with the button down

minds, because then no one would complain that _‘

Pitt students_don’t dress well.

Origirlrll Poetry

At M Idclay S(’.I‘l.€S
By PAT CHERKIN

A charming young poet, VV.
5, Merwin, read at the Mid-
day Series last week. He was
introduced by Dr. Richard
Tobias of the English depart-

‘ment as being “three times a
virtuoso.”

His poetry, which he read with
perfect diction in a very pleasant
voice, was astutcly accurate in its
imagery and often refreshing in
its symbolism.

Many of his poems read were
based on familiar myths to which
he adds interesting interpreta-

" ‘tions of his own. Merwin read
first two poems from his collection
"Green With Beasts.” In “Tobac-
co,” he echoes the nonchalant at-
titude of the smoker. “Her Wis-
dam” presents a paradoxically

9 true thought in the line, “things

forever violated—forever virgin.”

‘ Life’s Perplexities

The second group of poems
which Merwin read were'set in
Western Pennsylvania and based
on his grandfather and grand-
mother. In “Grandfather And
The Old Men’s Home.” Merwin
perceptively describes the’ family
as, “beating their little Bibles till
he died.”

- “Sire” is an expression of the
perplexity of life. Merwin says
in it, “I can hear my footsteps
come up behind me and go on
ahead of me.”

Merwin read several poems
which he cals “departure poems.”
Among these are “Noah’s Raven,”
and “Departure’s Girlfriend.”
Talking about this theme, he men-
tioned the feeling of grief which
accompanies writing.

The Writer's /Loss

Merwin explained that the feel-
ings which ‘inspire a poem, once
expressed in writing, have escap-
ed the writer and thus he ex-
periences a loss.

Another of his “departure
poems” is “Route With No
Number” which haIf-conﬁdent-
ly advises, “When you come to
the end—-turn away.”

At the coffee hour, poet Mer-

v

win read and discussed his works‘

tions for a small group of students

Concept of Death

Merwin read on request, “Burn—
which alludes to
the concept of death being hard
to dispose of, in reference to his

died before the
an untimely death
that was impossible for him to
accept or understand.

Like Denise Levertov, an-
other young American poet who
read here earlier this year,
Merwin contends that a poem
speaks for itself. He said, “if
it could be better explained it
would be a bad poem.”

Merwin discussed why “it is
impossible to write a poem,” ar-
guing that a good poem more or
less happens onto the paper, and
that when one sits down with the
of writing a poem, he

intent
usually fails.
Rule Breaking

When asked about subjectivity
in writing poetry, which begin-
ning poets are usually warned
against, Merwin said, “Do what
you want—break the rules if you

like.”

It seems signiﬁcant that Mer-
win’s, earlier poetry is written
from a more impersonal point
of view, while his more recent
work is a clearer expression of
himself. ‘

Difference in Victory

By BOB SMIZIK ,

If Bbb Guzik is unwelcome in Bethlehem, Pa., it is un-
derstandable. Before 3,500 people, and with many more lis-
tening by radio, the Panther heavyweight dashed Lehigh’s
hopes of an undefeated season and gave the Cats a 16-14

triumph.

The Blue and Gold jumped off to an early 13-2 lead but

Lehigh’s expected superiority in=W

the upper weights earned them a

14-13 edge going into the ﬁnal ‘

match.
Down 1-0 going into the last

period, Guzik went to work. He ‘
quickly escaped to tie the match, 
and with 90 seconds remaining, he 

clinched it with a take down.
Team Effort

Despite Guzik’s heroics the vic-
tory was a team effort. Richard
Martin got the Cats off on the
right foot by pinning Pat Smartt
with 4:45 remaining. The two ad-

ditional points Martin earned by‘

the pin proved to be the deciding
factor in the match.

Larry Lauchle had some anx-
ious moments before decision-
ing Doug Baillie, 4-1. The Cats
now had an 8-0 lead.

For the second consecutive year
Daryl Kelvington and Curt Alex-
ander fought to a draw.

Zolikoff Wins

At 147 pounds John Zolikoff
piled up an 8-3 lead and then
hung on to beat Pete Gratto, 8-7.

Now with the score 13-2 the
Engineers made their come-
back. At 157 pounds the Engi-
neers put Kirk Pendleton on the
mat to face Panther Bill Robb.
In eight matches Pendleton had
,5 pins, a win on a default and
two decisions of 16-0 and 4-4,
and he defeated Robb by a score
of 7-0. '

Surprise Showing

Augie Arrigone and Paul Wil-
son both lost. Arrigone did sur-
prisingly well in losing to de-
fending Eastern champion, Thad
Turner, 5-1.

Jim Harrison suffered his
second loss of the year in the
191 pound class. Dave Augwell
defeated Harrison 9-5. Lehigh
now led for the ﬁrst time.

But it was to no ‘avail after

Tracknien Falter
In Final Attempt
For Indoor Win

An attempt by the Panther
trackmen for their ﬁrs’: dual meet
victory of the season fell short
Saturday as the Cats lost, 70% to
381/3, to Harvard. It was the Pan-
thers third consecutive loss and
concludes the. indoor dual meet
season.

Harvard copped both the mile

‘and two-mile relays which ac-

counted for ten of their points.
Had the Panthers ')een able to
win the relays the score would
have read 60-48.

The Panthers strong point was
in the field events where they
captured four ﬁrst places. Ed
Vamos won the broad jump with
a leap of 23 feet 11/; inches. Ron
Weiers captured the pole vault
and tied the Harvard Cage record
at 13 feet 6 inches.

Ed Sherlock tied for ﬁrst
place in the high jump with a.
6 feet 1 inch effort. But the best
Panther performance came from
Dan Kanell who established a.
new record for the Panthers in
the shot put.

Kanell, who has been threaten-
ing Larry Och’s record of 53 feet
8 inches set last season in the
Penn State meet, ﬁnally smashed
that mark with a throw of 54
feet 1/2 inch.

The Panthers fell short of the
mark in the running events. Bob
Shanfelt and Steve Munter were
the only winners, running the
40-yard dash in 4.7 seconds.

Hoopers Pull Near’

Upset Over WVU
In Close Contest

By TED COLTON

Revenge will be‘ in the
minds of Bobby Timmons’
roundball aggregation tomor-
row night as they travel to
New Wilmington to meet
the Westminster Titans.

In their ﬁrst meeting, which was
played at the Field House, the
Titans handed the Panthers a 76-
51 defeat breaking a four game
win streak and almost running the
Cats off the court. ’

Over the weekend three of the
Panther athletic teams, basketball,
wrestling and gym, were played
before capacity crowds. One of the
local papers commented, “The
basketball, wrestling and gym
teams will be playing before more
than 16,000 fans and the odds are
about 16,000 to 1 that anyone of
them will win.”

Well, the wrestling team did the
impossible by beating Lehigh, and
the Cagers almost did the same
thing.

Mountaineers Outplayed

Although they did fall to
mighty West Virginia, 92-84, the
Cats surprised everyone by lead-
ing most of the way and com-
pletely outplaying the Mountain-
eers in the ﬁrst half and part of
the second.

WVU coach George King,
with his team trailing by six
points at half time, 35-41, de-

Panthers Favored to Capture First Wednesday
In Rescheduled Contest With Georgia Tech

Provided that they
make proper «airplane con-

nections, Coach Warren
Neiger’s Panther gymnasts

ﬁgure to gain their ﬁrst vic-
tory of the season in Atlanta,

Georgia, on Wednesday evening
when they clash with Lyle Wel-
ser’s Georgia Tech Yellow Jack-
ets. _ .

The Jungle Cats were to_ have
encountered the Engineers on
February 4, in Atlanta, but due to
poor weather conditions in Pitts-
burgh at the time, the meet had
to be postponed since the Pan-
thers’ proposed flight had to be
grounded. '

Since Neiger was formerly Wel-
ser’s assistant gym coach at
Georgia Tech for several years in
the late 1940’s, the two teams
had little difficulty in resched-
uling the contest.

This will mark the fourth
gymnastics meeting between the
two schools. In all three previ-
ous struggles the Panthers have
finished on the long end of the
score, twice at home and once
abroad. If the Jungle Cats
should lose to Tech. it would
have to be considered a stunning
upset. 5

Meanwhile, the Panthers drop-
ped their fourth straight meet of
the season to Penn State at Uni-
versity Park last ‘Saturday 591/2-
361/2. The Lions were sparked by
Greg Weiss and Tom Seaward as
they recorded their fourth tri-
umph against only one setback.

The Blue and Gold's Earl Mc-
Connell, Joe Battaglia and Bob

 

can.“

Pingatore swept the tumbling to
give the Panthers an early 13-3
lead. But then the roof caved in
as Weiss and Seaward took over
and ended any hopes of an upset
by Skyscraper U.

Weiss captured both the side
horse and parallel bars while
Seaward took the high bar. The
Lion’s Bob Mamau and Gerry
Schaefer scored respective wins on
the rope and flying rings. The
Panthers’ Ed Zamecnik was sec-
ond to Seaward on the high bar.

Thus far the Cat gymnasts have
suffered defeats at the hands of
the two service schools, Army and
the Naval Academy, and were
dealt their third consecutive loss

by Syracuse. If the Panthers don’t
top the Engineers this Wednesday,
the plane trip back north should
be a quiet one.

cided to go into his famed “panic
press’ which had won the Moun-
taineer’s last four ball games.
The so-called “panic press”
seems to rattle even the best
backcourt men in the country, in-
cluding Penn State’s Mark Du-
Mars. Dick Falenski, Torn Ma-
loney and Ben Jinks are not the
best backcourt men in the coun-
try but they too were rattled.
Team Rattled
It seemed that everybody on
the Panther’s team was rattled.
The Cats started to throw the
ball away, pass up the good shots,
and blow easy layups.

As a result the Mountaineers
scored eight points in a row to
tie the score at 49 all. Later they
scored six in a row to tie it up
again at 70 all and ﬁnally scored
nine consecutive points to jump

margin to eight points at 82-74,
putting the game on ice.

The Panthers had five men in
double ﬁgures, Jinks, 18; Maloney
and John Fridley, 17, Falenski, 14,
and John Maczuzk with 10. Lee
Petrone was high for the Moun-
taineers with 22 and Jim Ritchie
had 17.

WVU star Ron Thornhad an-
other bad night against the Pan-
thers scoring only six points. He
hurt his ankle in the second half
and was taken out. In the two
meetings between the Cats and
WVU Thorn has scored 14 points
and Maloney has registered 41.

F1*osI1MCagers
At Westminster

' By ED HOWARD

Carl Peterson’s frosh cagers
take an 11-3 record to New Wil-
mington tomorrow night, when
they face the Westminster jayvee
squad.

The C'at Cubs sustained their
third loss Saturday night, bowing
to the West Virginia yearlings,
90-63. The Yhung Mounties now
stand 13-.1 and have avenged their
only loss in the last two years.

With Brian Generalovich miss-
ing from the-lineup because of
an ankle sprain, the Panthers
showed a need for both rebound-
ing strength and scoring punch.

Calvin Sheffield made’ a great

effort to take up the slack by
pouring in 31 points, but he had
no help from his teammates. Paul
Krieger was second in line for the
Jungle Cats with eight markers.,
The boys from the hills were
just too tall. They averaged
about three inches taller per
man, and that advantage show-
ed up in the statistics.
The Mounties out-rebounded
their guests, 63-39, and this gave
them 27 more shots.

“We just didn’t have the height’

to stop- those big boys”, said
Coach Peterson. “Our ﬂoor game
was much better than theirs-
sharper passing, picks, screens,
that sort of thing. But they
didn’t have to work for their
shots; they just stod around the
basket and tipped the ball til it
went in.” ‘

Rufus H. Fitzgerald was Chancellor of the University in

1949-51. There were only two

dormitories, DeSota Hall and

Graduate (now Dithridge) House, with a combined capacity

of less than 130 men.

The basketball team played its home games in the Sta-

—dium Gym, and the Art Cinema advertised reduced student

‘rates for showings of Cyrano dev

Bergerac.

But the most colorful story at
Cathedral U. that year was the
Penn State football game. It was
scheduled for the Stadium on the
Saturday after Thanksgiving, but
it started to snow on Friday night.

Game Postponed

By Saturday morning a foot. of
snow had fallen. The Panther
gridders, staying at a hotel in
Wilkinsburg, were stranded. This,
coupled with the fact that seats
in the stadium were buried under
the white stuff, caused the game

. to be postponed to the following

Monday.
By the time Monday rolled
around, over two and one-half
feet of snow was on the ground,
biggest accumulation in Pitts-
burgh history, and the seats
were still buried. The game was
rescheduled again, this time for
the following Saturday. _
Bob Timmons, Cat basketball
tutor, was end coach for the grid-
ders that year under head man
Len Casanova. V
Timmbns Recalls
“The weather was unbeliveably
bad,” Timmons recalled. “I was
snowed in at my home until late
Monday night, and three of the
other assistants were‘ in the same

situation. If the game had been

Played that first Saturday or the
following Monday, there ‘would
-have been no fans, no officials, no

Coaching staff -—- even the Pitt
football team couldn’t have made
it.”

After all the commotion, the
game itself was an anti-climax.
Played in Forbes Fieldbecause
of the sheltered seats available
there, the contest drew only
6000 hardy fans. Beneath sever-
al inches of muck, the playing
ﬁeld was frozen solid.

After State had jumped oft’ to
a 21-0 lead, Panther quarterback
Bob Bestwick directed a drive
that started inside his own ten-
yard line, passing for most of the
yardage himself. Just before the
half ended, Bestwick hit end Chris
Warriner in the end zone for a
touchdown. Tackle Nick Bolkovac.
All—American candidate. kicked
the PAT.

In the third period Bestwick
connected again, this time to Nick
DeRosa, who made a somersault
catch. Bolkovac converted again,
and the score read 21-14. After
an interception, fullback Jim
‘Campbell plunged into pay-dirt to
pull the Jungle Cuts to within a
single point with seconds left to

play.
Then Bolkovac, whose nick-
name was “Automatic” and who

hadn’t missed an extra point all
year, kicked wide to the left.
Final score: State 21, Pitt 20.

Although the Panther matmen aren‘t having the outstanding sea-
son expected earlier this year, the team does have one of the best
wrestlers in the country in Dick l\lartin. an athlete who has developed
into a’123-pound dynamo.

Last year the Panthers had [our undefeated wrestlers called the
"Mighty Mites." This year Martin stands alone as the only undefeated

erer. for it happens to him every time he steps on to the mat.

“It croesn‘t matter if there are three or 3,00‘) spectators, most
wrestlers seldom hear the crowd," Martin says, “it's like being all
alone. The only time I hear the crowd is when there is a break in
the match or when one of us is hurt."

How do wrestlers get instructions from their coach during a
match? According to Martin a wrestler will fake an injury, par-
ticularly if he is unable to solve a hold or if he wants-to check
t-heitime remaining. A‘wrestler doesn’t have time to think. The
sport is so fast that wrestling becomes a matter of training.
“Vvhen an opponent makes a move," Martin says, “you are train-

ed to make a counter move.”

Martin likes any match with a ﬁghting opponent. “I hate a team
that stalls,” the 123-pounder says. Two teams on the Panthers’ sched-
ule that Martin accuses of using stalling tactics are Syracuse and
Michigan. “When I’m on the mat I want to wrestle, I expect my op-

ponent to do the. same,” Martin says.

Martin’s keen enthusiasm for the sport that brought. respect and
stems from Latrobe High
whom Martin credits with
much of his prowess today. he was u”ndefeated in dual meet com-
petition and won the PIAL title during his sophomore and junior

glory to Greek and Roman

Martin is a junior. majoring in economics.

“I like Pitt,” Martin says. “Academically it is one of the best
colleges in the nation. It has a fine record of good wrestling. As
wrestlers, we live together and this, I feel, has played an im-
ortant part in team unity." Coach Rex Peery is given credit for
the developing of Martin to the place where he is the only unde-

feated wrestler on the team.

As a junior, l\Tai‘t:in has another year in which he can play an
important part in Pitt’s wrestling. According to coach Pecry, Martin
possesses all the polish neces.<:a1.‘y to bring him a National Wrestling

Championship.

‘WORDS: THEIR CAUSE AND CURE

Today let‘ us take up the subject of etymology (or entomology,
as it is sometimes called) which is the study of word origins
(or insects, as they are sometimes called).

VVhere are word origins (insects) to be found? VVell sir, some-
times words are proper names that have passed into the language.
Take, for instance, the words used in electricity: ampere was
named after its discoverer, the Frenclnnan Andre Marie Ampere
(1775-1836); similarly 0/zm was named after the German G. S.
Ohm (1781-1854), watt after the Scot James Vlfat-t (1736-1819),
and bulb after the American lfred C. Bulb (1843-1912).

There is, incidentally, quite a poignant little story about Mr.
Bulb. Until Bulb’s invention, all illumination was provided by
gas, which was named after its inventor Milton T. Gas who,
strange to tell, had been Bulb’s roommate at Cal Tech! In fact,
strange to tell, the third man sharing the room with Bulb and
Gas was also one whose name burns bright in the annals of
illumination—Walter Candle! _

The three roommates were inseparable companions in col-
lege. After graduation all three did research in the problem of
artiﬁcial light, which at this time did not exist. All America
used to go to bed with the chickens. In fact, many Americans
were chickens.

Well sir, the three comr:tdes—Bulb, Gas, and Candle—-
promiscd to be friends forever when they left school, but success,
alas, spoiled all that. First Candle invented the candle, got
rich, and forgot his old friends. Then (las invented gas, got rich,
bankrupted Candle, and forgot his old friends. Then Bulb in-
vented the bulb, got rich, bankruptcd Gas, and forgot his
old friends. -— '

  

fréz}/7?§%;Z;7}za

C'u.ndle and Gas, bitter and impoverished at the age respec-
tively of 75 and 71, went to sea as respectively the world’s
oldest and second oldest cabin boy. Bulb, rich and grand, also
went to sea, but he went in style——as a first,-class passenger on
luxury liners. — ‘

Well sir, strange to tell, all three were aboard the ill-fated
Lusitania when she was sunk in the -North Atlantic. An_d,
stramge to tell, when they were swimming for their lives after the
shipwreck, all three clambercd aboard the same dinghy!

Well sir, chastened and made wiser by their brush with death,
they fell into each other’s arms and wept and exchanged for-
giveness and became fast friends all over again.

For three years they drifted in the dinghy, shaking hands and
singing the Cal Tech rou.-‘er all the while. Then, at long last,
they spied a passing liner and were taken aboard.

They remained fast friends for the rest of their days, which,
I regret to report, were not many, bcc:u_ise the liner which picked

, them up was the Titanic.

W hat a pity that l\'I:tI‘ll)(>I‘()S were not invented during the
lifetimes of Bulb, Gas, and Caiidlel Had there been Marlboros,
these three friends never would have grown apart because they
would have known how much, despite their differences, they still
had in common. I mean to say that lVlarlboros can be lit by
candle, by gas, or by electricity, and no matter how you light
them, you always get a full-ﬂavored smoke, a ﬁlter cigarette
with an unﬁltered taste that makes anyone-—-including Bulb,
Gas, and Candle—settle back and forget anger and strife and

smile the sweet smile of friendship on all who p2l.”<S!
