The emotional basis of the new‘ militarism .-in the
.United States, Great Britain, and France may not be
exactly thesame has that of Italy, Germany, and Japan,
‘as expressed by Mussolini. But the economicmotives.
are identical.‘ Each of these countries is capitalistic
in structure, and every capitalist nation, in order to pre-

later. stages, begin a policy of imperialism, apolicy of
exploitationhof the markets _and resources of weaker
peoples. For every well-developed -capitalist nation has
huge surpluses of goods which ' cannot be absorbed at
home and which must be sold in other countries’ if there
