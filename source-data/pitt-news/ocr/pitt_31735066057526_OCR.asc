Credit cards can be of good use

By Kathleen Scanlon
Staff Writer

( Editors’ note: This is the second part of a
two—part series.)
The University Book Center cashier slides

the textbooks lightly across the sensor on-

the checkout counter. The total comes to
over $80.

Pitt sophomore Matt Moluf spots a famil-
iar face and begins to chat as he slips his
credit card out of his wallet and holds it out
to the cashier.

The cashier knows what to do. She com-
pletes the transaction while Moluf talks to
his friend.

Credit cards can make buying textbooks .

easy. Credit cards can make buying any-
thing easy. Credit card companies and con-
sumer advocacy groups advise students to
enjoy the conveniences of credit cards but
to beware of the debt that can pile up after a
string of easy transactions.

Credit card companies “want students to
think of using credit cards just as [they use]
cash,” said Maria Rullo, spokesperson for

Visa and Mastercard issuer, Citibank.
Citibar1k’s Max Moore educational package
advises that students think twice about
charging large purchases because of the
length of time it will take to pay them off.
Students may think that as long as they
pay the minimum payment each month,

College
Credit

they’re OK, said Ruth Susswein, executive
director of Bankcard Holders of America.
The minimum amount required each month
can be as low as 2 percent of the total bal-
ance.

So charging $1,000 today may seem easy
if you’re only looking at paying about $20 a
month. But, Susswein said, you’ll pay for it
over the next nine years. And with an inter-
est rate of 17 percent, by the time you’ve
finished paying for it, $776 will have been
added to your bill, she said.

“You’ve now finished your bachelor’s
degree, your master’s degree and you’ve
been working for a few years, but you’re
still paying off your freshman spending
spree,” she said.

Students need to realize that when they
charge an item, they’re being charged inter-
est every day, Susswein said.

“You don’t have a grace period,” she said.

“You [may] end up spending hundreds of
_ dollars in interest each year.”

“One of the ways to cut back on that is to
pay the bill when it arrives. Pay it on a sec-
ond and you save yourself money.”

A student can establish a solid credit
record if he/she pays off -the entire balance
every month, or at least makes minimum
payments on time. But even if the student
has a spotless credit record, accumulating
too many cards can jeopardize his/her
chances for future loans.

If a banker looks at a loan applicant’s
credit report and sees that he/she has five or
six credit lines open, the banker may con-
sider the applicant more of a risk, Susswein

The case will remain open

Maybe you can’t judge a book by its
cover, but Pitt students can begin judg-
ing the University Library System by
its new director, Dr. Rush Miller.

Miller came to Pitt from Bowling
Green State University where he had
served as dean of libraries and learning
resources since 1986.

As director of Pitt’s library system,
Miller’s job is to oversee the operation
of 13 libraries on the Oakland campus.

“I basically provide administrative
coordination and leadership to the
ULS, chart directions for the future and
provide the staff with the resources
they need,” Miller said.

Miller studied for a total of eight
years to become a librarian. He earned
a B.A. in history at Delta State
University, master’s and doctoral
degrees in medieval history from
Mississippi State University and finally
his master’s in library science from
Florida State University.

Promoting a campus—wide multicul-
tural effort through the library was one
of Miller’s key goals in his position at

Bowling Green. Continuing to advo-
cate cultural diversity programs at Pitt
is something that Miller said he is
looking into.

Being a

college student in

Mississippi in the ‘60s and a charter
member in an interracial fraternity
helped him get involved in that multi-
cultural effort, Miller said.

“I have taught at a predominantly
black university  and have continued

Pitt Profiles

to feel it’s
important,”
Miller said.

According
to Miller, “A
library should
be a place .
welcoming to everyone equally, with a
tolerant atmosphere  We all have
biases; as librarians our role is to help
everyone and to understand their cul-
tural differences.”

Starting this week, Miller will meet
with staff and visit every department in
the ULS, looking for ways to broaden
staff input in decision making and
create an open consulting system with-
in the libraries. Miller also supports the
development of strong cooperative pro-

 

library director promotes multiculturalism

grams between Pitt’s libraries and
other libraries in Oakland and at other
universities, such as Penn State.
Miller’s early impressions of the
ULS at Pitt are that Pitt has an “out-
standing library system and a very
committed and dedicated staff.”
Miller’s family will move into their
house in the North Hills within two

iweeks, he said. His wife, Johnny, cur-

rently a high school librarian, will be
joining the
ULS staff
next year.
Miller ’ s
teenage
identical
twin sons,
John and Ed, will be freshmen at North
Allegheny High School this fall.

Miller also has a 21-year-old
son, Glenn, who is stationed with
the US. Navy in Oklahoma‘City,
and a 24-year-old daughter, Lisa,
who lives with her husband in Akron,
Ohio.

In his free time, Millersaid he enjoys
golfing with his wife, who taught him
the game.

He is also an avid reader, polishing

Miller rarely read fiction before he
became a librarian. Now, Miller stays
up late at night reading suspense and
horror novels by authors such as Anne
Rice, Robert Ludlum and Stephen
King. A

Miller said he has witnessed some
enormous library fines in all his years
as a librarian.

“The largest fine I’ve actually seen
paid was $800, students commonly had
$500 fines from late fees and lost
materials at Bowling Green though.”
Miller said.

One of the oddest experiences Miller
has been through  a librarian is when
he had to assist in cleaning up 70,000
gallons of rain water which flooded the
ground floor of the library at Bowling
Green.

Forty staff members, from custodians
to administrator, ran wet vacuums for
five hours to clean up the mess, and
only 10 floor tiles ended up being lost
in the ﬂood. ‘

“That experience shows that staffs
really do care about their collections

marking the containers on
campus will help their use.

The group is also con-

? cerned for recycling inrthe

Oakland area in general.
“Many students have come
to our table and said that
their landlord doesn’t recy-
cle,” said Gruver. She added
the school should have its
own collection center with
bins big enough to hold bags
full of recyclable goods.
This -would allow those who
live away from campus to
maybe make one trip a week
to donate their goods.
Although the City of
Pittsburgh does have a

ready to hear about the real
music scene, and claim some
ground. Yeah, that’s you, and
this is the new column.

What’s it all about?
Anything: anything that sucks,
anything that doesn’t.

Wanted: all ages shows with
decent sound and crowds that
enjoy music. Wanted: grrrl
bands. I don’t know, maybe
l’m living in a dream, but I do
believe somewhere, somehow
Pittsburgh can provide these
things. We have two serious
problems in this city. One is
that little music lovers like
myself are seeking a good
time, and as soon as we see
an appealing flyer, fine print
that says “over 21” breaks our
hearts. The second problem is
that l’m sick of seeing every
band look the same, just a
bunch of guys trying to be
cool. Oh God, did I just offend
someone?

Now for the story, and the
femme flavor of the month is 
Nothing Painted Blue. OK, so
it’s a bunch of guys from
California, but their music

Wanted: grrrls who are kicks ass.

The story began as l forked
over my five bucks to Manny,
the big guy about town, I
guess. I entered Bellefield
Hall, which had to be the
absolute worst place to hold a
show. Liquid Brick was the
first band to play, and,
although l’m sure their music
isn’t half-bad, the huge 20-per—
son turnout was very unin-
spired. They started the first
song only to find that, accord-
ing to the sound guys, vocals
were not a necessary part of
their show. The vocals got
fixed — l’m not sure whether
l’m happy about that —— but as
far as the sound went, they

would have been better off

acoustic.

As far as the second band
(Potholder) goes, refer to the
previous paragraph because
I’d like to get to the good part:
Nothing Painted Blue. I was

I delighted to see a band that

actually looked different. No
Vans, no cool-ass attitude, just
straightforward talent and
good music. The audience
actually responded to them,

not exactly by standing up or
anything exciting like that, but
by clapping appropriately after
each song; it was damn moti-
vating. The sound still sucked,
but Franklin Brun’s jokes and
audience—response questions

super-exciting when Michael

Every so often you'll read
about a New York musician,
probably from the “downtown
scene,” who is breaking down
barriers or pushing jazz farther
than it has ever gone before. A
lot of times it might be true,
and other times it might just be
the initial excitement we writ-
ers feel after hearing powerful
music.

Well, Charles Gayle is the
be-all and end-all of this kind

a of musician. The alpha and the

omega. _

And that isn’t just hype.

Let’s step back a second to
puthim in a context:

Back in the early ‘60s, jazz
took one of its many twists

when players like Albert Ayler, E

Cecil Taylor and Ornette
Coleman stopped following
standard forms of melody and
rhythm in their music. Called
free jazz or avant garde jazz,
this frenzied sound described,
in music,the turbulence of the
era and created more contro-

versy than any style of jazz
before or since.

The original New York free
jazz movement splintered in
many directions as the ‘60s
came to a close. Some musi-
cians died, some moved to
Europe, some graduated to
more conventional forms of
jazz. Tenor saxophonist
Charles Gayle plays music
that sounds as vital now as it
did over two decades ago. In
fact his playing has gotten

. stronger since he first landed

in New York in the ‘70s.

But until 1983, Gayle’s
music rarely emanated from
jazz clubs. Normally he could
only be heard in the subway
stations where his horn com-
peted with the trains to see
who could squeal the loudest.
Gayle has no home to speak
off. He lives in a squat house
and plays ‘on the streets to
earn money for food.

Throughout the years, his
devotion to Christianity kept

Gayle from compromising his
life and his music. Gradually
people began to take notice.
He was flown to Europe for a
couple tours. The Knitting
Factory in New York gave him
a regular Monday night
engagement. And when peo-
ple like Sonic Youth’s Thurston
Moore began raving about
Gayle, rock fans tuned in.

‘‘If I could make my horn
sound like a Mack truck,”
Gayle once said, ‘‘I’d do it.” A
brief listen to any of his music
proves this. He bends and
twists convoluted lines out his
sax, pushing himself and his
band to a point where you
think they’ll explode. But they
don’t. They just keep playing
at the same high level of inten-
sity.

He would have it no other
way. Gayle wants to push him-
self, playing “at” music instead
of just playing music. Each
performance must be more
intense than the last one. “l

feel like I’m not radical enough
in my playing,” he says. “Just
through that horn, I want to 
empty the joint .— just to be
that unsettling.”

The powerful attitude won
Gayle the favor of another
artist determined to push the
artistic envelope, Henry
Rollins. Last fall Gayle record-
ed a session with Hank and
his band.

Next week when Gayle and
his trio come to Pittsburgh,
chances are they might level

Jammie Massey did not
even flinch as a splinter of sur-
gical steel pierced through her

down her flushed face. After a

Massey’s nose, reflected the
studio light with a quick twin-

Tim Girone is the man
behind the piercing needle at
Oakland’s newest tattoo and
piercing studio called lnka
Dinka Doo. He is a true disci-
ple of lnka Dinka Doo’s clean,
safe and happy tattoo and
piercing philosophy.

Girone has been profession-
ally piercing for 3 years. He
was an apprentice for 8
months in Philadelphia where
he learned all the different
techniques to become a pro-
fessional body piercer.
Besides the lone act of pierc-

ing, Girone learned steriliza-
tion techniques and healing
procedures that are the back
bone of safe piercing. .

Turning himself into a
proverbial pin cushion, Girone
pierced, of all things, his
tongue and V penis. He
described himself as an “avid
victim” of piercing.

Girone sees piercing as a
form of self-expression, not
self-mutilation, and he said,
‘‘I’m a hot rod with all the

chrome.” Each piercing is like

a custom accessory to his
body. Anybody interested in
hot-rodding their body has a
choice of 25 different places.
We all know about pierced
ears, and a pierced nose
rarely turns a head, but how
about a pierced lip or eye-
brow? Pierced genitals any-
one?

piercings have been around
for ages. Cultures from
Europe to Africa have had
piercings as a marker of
chastity or adulthood. It has
been rumored that Queen
Victoria’s consort, Prince
Albert, had his genitals
pierced. There is a piercing

named after him to honor this V

rumor.
Zipping back into the pre-

. sent, the fear of disease and

infection has somewhat styg-
matized body piercing. Girone
does not take this lightly, so
every precaution is taken to
make sure that his piercings
are as safe as humanly possi-
ble. V

An autoclave is used to
sterilize all of Girone’s pierc-
ing equipment. Autoclaves are
the only devices which can
100 percent sterilize an
object. We are talking no

‘germs, no bacteria, just clean,

hard steel. Every needle
Girone uses is pitched into a
red medical waste container
after being used. The area to
be pierced is swabbed down
with an antiseptic. Germs do

not enter the equation when E

Girone is piercing.

training, editors, English
majors and other literary-
minded individuals: This fall
the Three Rivers Lecture
Series hosts five writers, all
uniquely talented in their field.
All lectures will be held at the
Carnegie’s Lecture and Music
halls, here in Oakland, start-
ing at 7:30 p.m.

The first, and potentially the
most fascinating of the talks,
will be given by Larry
McMurtry next Monday, Sept.
26. McMurtry is the author of
17 novels including “Anything,
for Billy;” “Lonesome Dove,”
which was made into a great
television mini-series; and
“The Last Picture Show;’’
“Terms of Endearment;” and ’
“Horseman, PassBy,” all of
which were made into films.
McMurtry is one of those rare
writers who enjoys critical and
academic appreciation and
entertains the general public
at the same time. He doesn't
allow any of his characters to
play a one-dimensional role,
in effect there are no support-
ing players but rather each
person we meet in Larry
McMurtry’s world, however
briefly, seems layered and O
alive, r
McMurtry manages to do all
this while maintaining a con-
sistent and moving story line.
As many people know,
McMurtry’s novels are gener-
ally set in the Wild West of the
late 19th century. His novel
on Billy the Kid is perhaps the
last word, on this persona.

Billy is the West’s classic

anti-hero, yet he hasn’t really
earned that title. lt’s just sort of
fallen into his lap. The people
he kills aren't bad and not nec-
essarily good either. Billy is so
good-natured that people
immediately take to him, only
to realize what a myopic, illogi-
cal world he lives in (and per-
haps which we all live in). In
Billy’s case, situations always
seems toturn deadly. Billy is
uneducated and not very intu-
itively smart either. He makes
arbitrary and spontaneous

McMurtry’s Billy doesn't
come across as a hero. He
can’t fight without a gun and
never seems to shoot the peo-
ple who deserve it. Billy is
merely a violent enigma.

McMurtry said ‘Of his writing,
“ln my own practice, writing fic-
tion has always seemed a
semiconscious activity. l con-
centrate so hard on visualizing
my characters that my actual
surroundings blur. My charac-
ters seem to be speeding

thr

type unflaggingly in order to
keep them in sight.” Appearing
with McMurtry will be Diana
Ossana, his collaborator and
herself a screenplay writer and
novelist. She helped him write
his current book on Pretty Boy
Floyd.

The series continues on Oct.
26, with Doris Lessing, author
of “The Golden Notebook” and
a notedly powerful speaker.
On Nov. 7, Jonathan Kozol will
speak about his latest book

  

Savage lnequa|ities” in which
he criticizes public education.
Dec. 1 brings Blanche Wiesen
Cook, the biographer of Elanor
Roosevelt. Finally, Dec. 68 is
Margeret Atwood, short story
writer and novelist. Her works
include “Wilderness Tips” and
“The Handmaid’s Tale”. There
are several more speakers
allotted for the springtime. For

to be used just once,” said
Girone to a customer who
found a needle at home and
wanted to pierce herself. He
added that piercing at home is,
“the best way to‘ mutilate your-
self.” Girone quickly turned the
unsuspecting woman away
from the fruitless thought of
trying to turn a navel piercing
into a home job.

To make the client fully
aware of what he is about to
do, Girone makes each client
sign a form which guarantees
him that the client is at least 18
years old and is aware of any
consequences resulting from
the piercing. These conse-
quences are swelling or possi-
ble infection due to the client
neglecting to care for the
pierced area. Girone said that
when a client reads this form,
he can tell if the client is high,
drunk or incoherent. The form
basically weeds out any idiots.

Once the piercing is finished,
Girone instructs his client on
the proper care of the piercing.
He sounds like a doctor with

his deepening voice prescrib-
ing the various steps one has
to take while caring for a ten-
der, new piercing. This “break-
in” period, which is different for
every piercing, is essential for
the health of the client.
Handling the more private
and sensitive parts of a
stranger takes some serious
tact and etiquette. The aver-
age person would probably
feel uncomfortable piercing the
nipples or genitals of the oppo-
site sex. Not Girone, he is a
complete professional when it
comes to these sensitive pierc-
ings. He claims to have never
lost his cool with such clients.
Monica Hidalgo came to lnka
Dinka Doc to. have a nipple
pierced. Girone set up his pri-
vacy divider and asked
Hidalgo to feel right at home.
From behind the screens, one
could hear Girone breaking the
obvious tension with jokes and
petty conversation. Hidalgo
was getting off to the needle
going through her nipple when
she said, ‘‘I’m really getting

turned on.” Without so much
as a wimper or a scream,
Hidalgo was pierced and in a
hell of a good mood, saying, ,“lt
was a breathtaking experi-
ence.” .
Wanting to expand his hori-
zons, Girone is heading due
east to Europe for two weeks
at the end of September. He
plans on doing some piercing if
the opportunity should present
itself. This man just cannot put
a piercing needle down. He
said that he has a hard time

leaving his business for even a A

short time. Send us a postcard
while you are gone, brother!
Girone has a fantasy about
his piercing profession. He
dreams of a mobile piercing
unit. He would like to get an
old ambulance and fix it up into
a mini-piercing studio. Girone
could come right to your
house, or set up shop in front
of a local park. He smiled
when he thought of all the pos-
sibilities. Does anybody have a
used -ambulance really cheap?

“You’ve got $25,000 worth of credit
available to you and nothing is stopping
you from using [all of it]. The riskier you
are, the less interested I am,” she said.

Susswein said it is safest for a student
to carry just one major credit card, espe-
cially if the student has no income.

Some students collect credit cards
because it is so easy to get credit while in

college. It’s easier for students to get .

credit than it is for some people in the
work force, Susswein told a House sub-
committee in March.

“College students with no job, no

assets, no income, no credit history and
no means of supporting themselves are
eligible for unsecured credit, and in some
cases quite a bit of credit. Students are
being courted by the biggest names in
0 “Without exception, no other group
with this same, lack of credentials is
given the time of day by the credit com-
munity,” Susswein told the House sub-
committee. 0 ‘ - 5
Citibank has offered students credit
since 1983, Rullo said.’ Rullo would not
disclose what criteria Citibank judges

student applicants against, but said that
Citibank holds students to a different
“scoring system” than the rest of the pop-
ulation.

Rullo also would not reveal the per-
centage of student applicants that
Citibank accepts.

“The perception is that everyone who

 

 

applies gets one,” she said. “That’s not
true.”

Susswein said she wants credit card
issuers to offer credit lines to students

that vary according to how much money .

each student has.

Citibank does start students out with a
lower credit line than the rest of its card-

holder population, Rullo said. This gives

students a chance to prove themselves
responsible credit users.
“[It’s a] catch-22 — if you’re not given

credit, how can you establish credit histo-

ry?” Rullo said.

Since college students are eligible to
receive credit, they are ‘also eligible to
ﬂee to credit counseling when haunted
by a debt too monstrous to handle on
their own. V

“Credit problems don’t really discrimi-

nate. It’s equal opportunity,” said Helen 0

Kaiser, spokesperson for the Consumer
Credit Counseling Service of Western
Pennsylvania.

People of all ages and all walks of life
go to Consumer Credit Counseling for
help. The average age of people who
come for money and credit management
advice is 37. “But we do see people -in
their 20s,” Kaiser said. Kaiser said col-
lege students have sought help from
Consumer Credit Counseling, but she has
no way of knowing how many. «

Consumer Credit Counseling offers a
debt—management program that provides
individual, tailor-made counseling ses-
sions. Sometimes creditors give breaks,
such as lowering payments, to individu-
als enrolled in these programs, Kaiser
said. Individuals stay with the counseling
for an average of three years and many

V times pay off all their debt.

People who come to Consumer Credit

Counseling carry an average of $23,000
of debt, not including mortgage, and

A make an average of $22,962 a year. They
have an average of 10 creditors chasing
them. - ' A

Opinions
Cultural ambivalence

Multicu_lturalism has become a buzzword on university cam-
puses in the last few years. Like most campus crusades it
started as a good idea, but has the tendency to get blown
way out of proportion and desirable significance. Similar to,
but not as of yet, as all—encompassing or evil as political cor-
rectness. A

The theory behind multiculturalism, cultural diversity or cul-
tural relativism is to expand the outlook and perspective of
both students and the general public. It does this by pointing
out the similarities and differences of various cultures. At its
highest form, cultural diversity demonstrates to people the
common links between all races of humanity while glorifying
the specific differences. For example, Joseph Campbell’s best-
selling book, “The Power of Myth” outlines the
common myth structures and themes which have pervaded
human society for millennium —— ranging from The Sphinx to
“Star Wars.” Yet he also celebrates the infinite differences pro-
duced by each culture or society’s take on love, the hero myth,
etc.

Pitt’s diversity week is a good example of positive uses of
multiculturalism. The Cultural Diversity Bias Reduction
Workshop challenges students to examine their own prejudices
and biases, which often have arisen out of their own back-
grounds. Anything like this which stimulates students to think
and challenges them to look inside themselves is a positive
outgrowth of cultural diversity.

However, multiculturalism is a two—headed monster. It has
become so pervasive that an audible groan is often heard when
someone merely mentions the word. In its negative incarna-
tions multiculturalism, seeks to distance and differentiate
“opposing cultures” on all levels. Rather than point out the
general similarities which tie humanity as a whole together, it
merely points out the differences, usually from the
standpoint of pushing the greatness of a minority culture vs.
the perceived evil of an elite culture.

A standard form of this is labeling people as Eurocentrics,

. which is usually meant as a derogatory term. Rather than bring

society closer together, this pushes us ‘farther apart and pro-
motes antipathy. As Pitt News columnist Ben Jackson pointed
out in his Sept. 14 column, the trend of diversity is leading us

toward separation and segregation. This can only hurt us, not.

help us.

Finally multiculturalism moves the full end of the spectrum
from the sublime (Campbell) to the ridiculous. The University
of Toledo Rockets have decided to replace their esteemed mas-
cot Rocky the Rocket because it was too phallic looking. The
new mascot must still maintain the rocket theme, but must
have a smiling appearance, be gender neutral and represent all
cultures. You ask how the **** can a rocket represent all cul-
tures? It’s rather easy actually, you simply make it into a
mushroom cloud and let it represent the destruction of all cul-
tures!

Lack of environmental avyareness  

ne of the great quotes

in American literature

comes from James
Fenimore Cooper’s “An
American Democrat,” in
which the author describes
the tendency of families
to pass on the wealth
they have acquired in their
lifetimes to their children,
and the resulting widening
of distance between social
classes as “the inevitable con-
sequences of civilization.”

Now, I humbly sub- mit

that there may current- ly
exist a more modern ver-
sion of Cooper’s statement.

For in the vast majority of
human society, our species
shows a definite tendency to
destruct the very environment
on which it exists, generation
after generation. From centu-
ry to century, mankind, in
addition to passing on wealth
and prosperity to its off-
spring, has managed to con-
tinue an unabated pattern of
“inevitable” environmental
scourge.

The evidence supporting
this assertion is saturatingly
prevalent. Viewed in chrono-
logical order, the movement
of man throughout the globe
has traditionally been accom-
panied by ecological
Armageddon — his progres-
sion can be viewed today by
the varying degrees 4 of
destruction: Asia, Africa and
Europe, the cradles of his
being, are today ecologically
in the most dire of straits,
while North America
remains in an intermediate
state with the rainforests of
South America and the tundra
of Antarctica remaining (and
perilously so) as the last

bastions of global wilderness.
This progression roughly
echoes the course of
humanity’s exploration and
settlement.

Today, our governments
scramble to recapture and re-
establish the wilderness
which previously existed.
What they are unable to recti-
fy, however, and what
represents the very heart of
the environmental problem, is
the presence of our own
species.

Barring the elimination of
ourselves from the face of the
planet (which may not be,
considering current trends,
that abstract of a notion) there
is no reason to assume that
thedecline of the state of
nature will cease.

Finger-pointing is very
popular when it_comes to
identifying those guilty of
mistreating the environment,
but one very common denom-
inator exists linking both the
accusing and the accused:
they are both humans.

Though this is admittedly a
ridiculously basic, obvious
statement; ours is the only
species capable of produc-
ing and complicating such
ego-centered situations and
faults.

The bluntest of cynics could
make a powerful case that we
have existed on the earth as a
plague, a harmful parasite of
the planet, hopelessly com-
placent in our destruction
because we are evolutionarily
the first species to conceive
of a spiritual existence that
takes priority over the mun-
dane.

In the web of life, we have
asserted our role as the mis-

guided hornet who plummets
into the intricate structure and
shreds it with brute, violent
strength. Unlike a true hornet,

however, we can also split the ,

atom and cool our residences
with machines, all the while
conscious of the havoc we
wreak. While it is true that
humans possess compassion,
they also have the resulting
capacity to ignore this emo-
tion; cold-hearted indiffer-
ence.

One popular opinion is that
we are the pinnacle of life,
but we have, whether it be of
our own fault or not, been
corrupted by different vices
into beings that are simulta-
neously capable of incredible
achievement or previously
unheard of destruction.

Our societies find themselves
waiting for the species to
realize the mistakes we have
made and to reverse the nega-
tive trend that has existed
for all ages of humanity.

I, however, contend that
the initial fault was not
because of outside influences
(we did, after all, arrive or
develop on what was previ-
ously a perfect planet) but
rather that we are simply
playing out a role for which
we are designed: that of envi-
ronmental scourge. Not once,
despite centuries upon cen-
turies of self-examination,
have we turned for good in a
new and positiveienviron-

mental direction. The p1ausi- '

ble explanation for this fail-
ure is, of course, that such a
potential simply does not
exist.

Dear Editor,

It was strange to see that The Pitt News
the comments of

It seems to me that the comments of a poet

interesting and valuable as the comments of an

Walk—on Merrick is no ordinary kicker

By Keith Pompey
Senior Staff Writer

As you look in the'Pitt
Football Media Guide, you
will not find a picture of kick-
er Dave Merrick. But as
Merrick walks around cam-
pus, you can not miss him, for
he stands 6-feet-1-inch tall
and weighs 235 pounds.

“I am big boy,” Merrick
said. “I don’t look at myself as
extremely big. But we grow
them good in Columbus..I am
U.S.D.A. grain fed. I don’t
miss a meal. ’

“I do not look like a field
goal kicker. In fact when peo-
ple ask me, and I tell them I’m
a field goal kicker, they’re like
‘Come on.’ I don’t-want to fit
the role of the field goal kick-
er.”

Despite his size, Merrick
has been Pitt’s best-kept
secret. The senior wa1k—on is
tops in the Big East in place
kicking. In three games,

I Merrick has kicked seven field

goals and connected on four
extra points.

His total of 25 points leads
the conference place kickers
in scoring and ranks him
fourth overall in the,Big East,
averaging 8.3 points a game.

But while the native of
Worthington, Ohio, has been a
splendid surprise to Pitt, just
about everyone in Division 1-
AA knows his name. As a
full—time soccer and football
player at Marshall University

from 1991-93, Merrick made
.716 percent of his field goal
attempts.

Last season, Merrick con-
nected on 19 of 25 field goal
attempts, tieing a Thundering
Herd school record. That sea-
son was also highlighted with
a 50—yarder.

But despite all of his accom-
plishments at Marshall,
Merrick will always be
remembered for the field goal
he didn’t get a chance to kick.

It all started two days before
Marshall was to face
Youngstown State for the
Division I-AA,national cham-
pionship. On that day, Merrick
was suspended from the team
for missing practice.

As the game approached,

Merrick’s older brother, Willy, (

was given, the job despite
never kicking in a game situa-
tion. ‘

But -with the score tied 28-
28 and 10 seconds to go,
Willy nailed the game—win—
ning, 22-yard field goal.
Merrick was left on the side-
lines rooting for his sibling. _

“I felt good for him ——- he
won the game,” Me-rricklsaid
while glancing at hislnational
championship ring. “That is
my brother, and I am happy he
was able to kick the winning
field goal. I

“But as far as myself getting
suspended for missing the
game, I felt the cbach made
the decision and I respected
my coach for making the deci-

sion. He was up front with me.
Granted,I wanted to play that
game, but heck, it is your
brother and what are yo
going to say.” 9

That’s when Merrick decid-
ed to say nothing. He bailed
ship and brought his kicking
act to Pitt.

With the transfer, ‘many
began to wonder why would
he leave a national power-
house like Marshall and trans-
fer to Pitt, a team that has only
won_'seven games in the last
three years.

“Basically I transferred
because there is a new rule

that says that you don’t have

to sit out from I—AA if you
move up to I—A,” Merrick
said. “I felt what I did on the
I—AA level last year, the great
season that I had, I wanted to
take the opportunity to try and
go up to the big—time schools.
I wanted the all-around atmos-
phere of a Big East school.

“I chose Pitt over all the
schools in the Big East

because Pitt has more national .

championships than all of
them. Coach Majors is one of
the best coaches that ever
coached college football, and
that is one of the things that I
looked at. I wanted togo

somewhere were I knew I had '

a great head coach, a great
special teams coach and that is
one of the things that I looked
at.” ‘

While arriving this fall,
Merrick had to beat the odds.

 

There he was, a 235-pound
kicker with only one year of
eligibility left, proving him-
self all over again.

“I took a big chance when I
transferred,” he said. “A lot of
schools might look at, ‘Hey
he’s got one year left. Why
give him a chance? Just keep
the guy we have.’ But I‘
looked at it like this, I think I
possess many good skills in
my kicking.

“I looked at where I could
fit in ,but I did take a big
chance coming up here
because if I didn’t play" well, I
wouldn’t be starter and I
wouldn’t know what I would
be doing. I just felt confident
that I would be starting.”

Soccer drops to 3-2 after loss to Robert Morris

By Ed Ziegenfuss
Staff Writer

The Pitt soccer team took to
the road on Thursday and for
the second consecutive time
returned to Oaklandon the
losing side of a 3-2 outcome.
The latest loss, coming from
the feet of the Robert Morris
Colonials, puts the Panthers’
record at 3-2.

“It was a tough game,” head
coach Joe Luxbacher said.
“They are ranked ahead of us
in our region, and we were
hoping to beat them.”

Robert Morris jumped out to
the early 1-0 lead and held on
to that margin at the half. It
was not until the second half
that the Panthers finally found
the net on a goal by junior for-
ward Dean Astorino, his first
goal of the season.

“Todd Graf had the ball in
the corner one-on—one with
the defender,” Astorino said.

us life and momentum.”

locked at one, the Colonials
beat the Panther defense to
take a 2-1 lead.

“We had a couple of defen-
sive breakdowns that cost us
goals,” Luxbacher said.

However, the Pitt team was
not finished. Junior Todd
Graf, who already had an
assist on the day, scored the
second Panther goal of the
game, his second on the sea-
son. But the joy in Pitt’s camp
did not last as Robert Morris
got the final goal of the game
to seal the Panthers’ fate. »

“We could have beaten
them,” junior midfielder Jeff
Porter said. “We were tied but
we let them back in the
game.”

Pitt did not receive great
efforts from its team leaders.
Senior co-captains Eric Prex,
Charlie Wasson and Bobby
Dyer were held pointless by
the Robert Morris defense.

“I played terrible,” Prex

“We just didn’t play very
well,” Porter said. “We played
good at times, but overall we
didn’t do it.”

The Panthers continued
their trend of slow starts. They
have only scored three goals
in the first half, opposed to
nine goals in the second.

“We started off a little slug-
gish, maybe because of it
being an afternoon game, but
we had too many breakdowns
on defense,” Astorino said.

Defense has been the
Achilles’ heel of the Pitt team
this year. In five games played
they have allowed opponents
to score 11 goals. One of
those games was a shutout, so
in the last four games the
Panthers have allowed no
fewer than two goals per game
to reach the back of the net.

“Robert Morris was a good
club, but we can not give up
three goals a game and expect
to win,” Luxbacher said. “We

Lady
Panthers
gearing
up for
Nebraska

By Adam Pincus
Staff Writer

Pitt assistant volleyball coach

. Brian Begor huddled his team

yesterday for a post-practice
meeting. Begor challenged the
team to raise its level of play to
that of its predecessors, who
have won the past six Big East
titles.

“I think as a group it has
been our lack of focus that has
caused us to be a little bit
inconsistent,” Begor said. “We
can play well and hard for a
point of time, but when you
play good teams like we do, if
you are not ready every night
and every play you get caught.
As a group, we really have to
focus on that.”

The Lady Panthers are cur-
rently ranked sixth in the Big
East with an overall record of
6-4. Pitt has played top—level
competition all year, having
lost to No. 1 Stanford. After
this weekend, the Lady
Panthers will have played the
top two teams in the nation
with a Friday matchup against
No. 2 Nebraska. However, that
is not an excuse for Pitt’s aver-
age record.

“I could ‘see if you are play-
ing bad teams,” Begor said. “I
wouldn’t say that the teams we
played last weekend were bad,
but they are not strong teams. I
could see letting up against
them, but if you can’t get up to
play Big Ten teams, or Pac-10,
or Big—Eight teams then you

need to check your pulse. If .

you are an athlete, then those
are the matches that you live

. for.”

A This past weekend, Pitt was
able to get back on track as the
team captured first place at the
Robert Morris College Volley
Fest. Pitt recorded victories
against Buffalo (3-1) and
Marshall (3-0) on Saturday,
then followed things up on
Sunday by knocking off Robert
Morris (3-0) and Duquesne (3-
0).
While the team was regain-
ing its winning form this week-
end, some of its members
enjoyed individual honors.
Junior outside hitter Sara
Mitchell and senior middle hit-
ter Melanie Gustafson were
named to the All-Volley Fest
team at the Robert Morris tour-
ney. Mitchell was also named
Big East player of the week.
Sara totaled 46 kills, 41 digs
and 4 aces that weekend, and
for the season she leads the
team with 115 digs and is sec-
ond on the squad with 95 kills.

Looking ahead to this week-
end, Pitt doesn’t know what to
expect from Nebraska.

Running backs decimated, Pin QB put to the test

By Ed Ziegenfuss
Staff Writer

Still licking their wounds
from last week’s 27-3 loss to
Ohio State, the Pitt football
team will try to make it two
wins in a row at home when
they host the 0-2 Boston
College Eagles at Pitt Stadium
Saturday at noon.

The Panther running game,
which has been decimated by
injuries to Curtis Martin, Billy
West and Tim Colicchio, was
virtually non—existent one week
ago against Ohio State. For a
team that was averaging nearly
300 yards rushing a game, the
best they could do against the
Buckeyes was a paltry 242
yards total offense.

Since the running attack has
been diminished, the pressure
to carry the Panther offense has
fallen to the passing game and
the arm of Sean Fitzgerald.
Through three games, the Pitt
air attack is only averaging
148.3 yards a game, next-to-
last in the conference.
Fitzgerald is 42 for 89 for a
total of 528 yards with three
touchdowns-and five intercep-
tions on the year.

With the team’s fate now
resting squarely on the shoul-
ders of the passing attack,
everyone on..the offensive side

of the ball must step up against
a ferocious Boston College
defense.

“The one thing that concerns
me, and I know we can
improve on, is our execution,”

Flanker Dietrich J ells (26) always has the potential to break open a game.

head coach Johnny Majors
said. “We have to improve our
pass protection.”

Pass protection will be the
key to success against the
Eagles. Led by inside. line-
backer Stephen Boyd and
strong safety Eric Shorter the
Boston College defense has

given up an average of 348.5
yards of total offense per game.
However, they remain a force
to be reckoned with.

The offensive line gave up
five sacks on Fitzgerald against

Ohio State, not to mention
about a dozen plays on which

the Panther signal caller was

forced to scramble out of the
pocket.

The two bright spots for the
Panther offensive line were

Keep an eye out around cam-
pus and you might see one of the
behemoths of the Panthers’
defense sporting a “Pitt Bulls.” T-
shirt. ‘ A

“It’s an attitude thing,” Pitt
defensive captain Tom Tumulty
said. “Pit bulls are always ﬁght-
ing, they bite something and
they don’t let go. They’re ﬁerce,
they’re tough.” ’

And no group on the Panthers’

' defense exemplifies that tough

pit bull attitude like the lineback-
ing corps. Tumulty, Jason
Chavis, Hayes Clark, Jon
McCray, Myles Davis and
Gerald Simpson might not be
willing to admit it, but they are
the strength of the Pitt defense.
“I’m not going to say anybody
is better than anybody else,”
Chavis said. “But I will say that
we try our hardest and we have
the attitude that we’re the best

Jason Chavis is Pitt's second leading tackler with 33.

 

out on the ﬁeld.”

Tumulty gets abit more tech-
nical when talking about the
position, “We’re pass and run, so
schematically I guess the
defense starts with the lineback-
ers,” he said. “You can have
great defensive linemen and D-
backs, but if you have real sad
linebackers I don’t think you’re
going to be real good.”

One of the sayings on the back
of those “Pitt Bulls” shirts reads,
“If it is to be, it’s up to me!” The
Pitt linebackers take that to
heart.

“Our defensive line is the first
line of defense,” Simpson said.
“But if you get past them you
gotta face the linebackers, and I
seriously doubt if you get past
us.”

Tumulty leads the club with
41 tackles, averaging nearly 14 a
game.

“Tom is the all—around line-

backer, a great tackler,” Chavis

said.

“Tom makes plays,” Hayes
said shaking his head. “I don’t
know how he does it sometimes,
he just makes plays.”

Chavis is second on the team

with 33 tackles. He’s also recov--

ered two fumbles and picked off
a pass. It’s a sign that the line-
backer who finished I992 a
starter, but saw his playing time
cut significantly last year, is
back.

“He has improved 100 percent
over last year,” Clark said.

daged right hand. The offen-
sive line is also slightly banged
up for the game. Junior offen-
sive guard Brian Curran and
redshirt freshman Reggie
Thomas are nursing injuries.
Neither one should miss this

Martin out, West injured, Fitzgerald key to offensive attack

Saturday’s game.

With the decision about who
is going to start at running back
for the Panthers still up in the
air, the wide receivers become
a focal point of the offense.

Senior Billy Davis is the
leading receiver this year for
Pitt. He has caught 14 passes
for 159 yards, both of which
are team highs. He has also
caught a touchdown. Dietrich
J ells has hauled in nine catches
for 123 yards and one touch-
down. He now has 1,724 career
receiving yards and needs just
541 more yards to become
Pitt’s all-time receiving
yardage leader. The third mem-
ber of this receiving trio, Mark
Butler, has _caught six passes
for 100 yardsand one score.
Butler is listed as probable for
the Boston College game with
a hand injury.

If the offensive line can give
Fitzgerald the time to find
these speedy receivers, then a
lot of pressure will be taken off
of Martin’s injured ankle and
West’s bad shoulder.

Time is of the essence for
Fitzgerald and the offense. If
they can hold the ball and use
the clock, the Panther defense
will have the luxury of staying
fresh instead of tiring out by

”Hc|rd-nosed" Eagles‘ defense hungry for first win

Linebacker
Boyd brings
big-time
numbers

By Sean Duncan
Asst. Sports Editor

After tough losses to
Michigan and Virginia Tech,
the Boston College Eagles are
hungry to sink their claws on
an unranked prey.

“They’re definitely going to
be coming here looking for a
win,” Pitt offensive tackle Matt
Bloom said.

Coming into the 1994 sea-
son, the Eagles’ highly touted
defense was rated second only

to Miami in

the Big East.

But after

allowing 34

points to

Michigan in

the BC sea-

son opener, its defense looked

as though it was just another
Big East hoax.

To make matters worse, the

2 Eagles would have to play the

offensive machine of the
Virginia Tech Hokies the fol-

lowing week.

But BC’s defense picked up
its shattered ego and rose to the
challenge. The Eagles showed
that the hype was no hoax as
they stymied Virginia Tech’s
quarterback Maurice DeShazo
and its high powered attack by
holding the Hokies to only 12
points and 233' total yards.

“Boston College is a very
aggressive, hard nose football
team,” Pitt head coach Johnny
Majors said. “They’re good on
defense, very good. They are
as aggressive, if not more so,
than Ohio State.” J

BC’s defense is spearheaded
by senior middle linebacker
Stephen Boyd. At 6-feet-l-inch
tall and 235 pounds, Boyd led
the Big East and broke the
Boston College record in tack-
les last year with 161 stops. He
was a unanimous first-team
Big East selection and was
named to the Football News
preseason All—America squad
this year.

Boyd’s campaign for the
Butkus Award, which goes to
the best linebacker in the coun-
try, is a strong one so far this
season. Last week against
Virginia Tech, Boyd racked up
an outrageous 25 tackles, 21 of
them unassisted, and tallied
two quarterback sacks. His per-
formance earned him the Big
East Co-Defensive Player of
the Week.

 

  

He also had 17 tackles
against Michigan, five of
which resulted in lost yardage.
Boyd recovered two fumbles as
well as causing one.

Boyd’s 42 tackles this season
put him on pace to crush the
school record he set as a junior.

“Stephen Boyd is one of the
best players we’ll face,” Bloom
said. “He’s a great linebacker.

“They’re very strong up front
with good linebackers,” Majors
said.

Sophomore Matt Haff and
senior Ed Sanabria round off
the linebacker slots. Starting
his first year at outside line-
backer, the 6-3, 228—pound
Haff is BC’s third-leading tack-
ler with 18.

Another discomforting note

for BC’s opponents is that

defensive end Mike Mamula,
who led the Big East in sacks

last year (11), has gained 15.

pounds of muscle in the offsea-
son. At 6-5 and 242 pounds,

- Mamula, a junior, is one of the

nation’s top pass rushers. He
also led the Big East in tackles
for yards lost for a total of -73
yards.

“They’re a good, well-
coached defense,” Bloom said.
“They don’t make many mis-
takes. They come off the rock
real hard.

“Pass rushing-wise, they
have a lot more moves than
Ohio State.”

Along with Mamula and his
14 tackles this season, Stalin
Colinet, Tim Morabito and
Chris Sullivan shore up the
defensive line. The line’s

immense size makes up for its ,

lack of seniority. At 6-6,
Colinet, a sophomore, was
named the starter at left end in
BC’s new “Stack” defensive
alignment.

BC coaches are banking on
nose guard Morabito having a
big season after his spring per-
formance. Morabito, a 6-3,
272-pound junior,filled in for
graduated All-Big East nose
guard John Stolberg last sea-
son.

He amassed 53 tackles, four
sacks and was a vital cog in
BC’s run stop defense.
Morabito’s strength is evident
by his bench press of 401
pounds. '

Sullivan, a junior, is a solid
6-5, 273-pound tackle. He’s a
third-year starter, and he is the
strongest player on the BC
team —— bench pressing 416

V pounds.

“They hit awfully hard,”
Majors said of BC’s line.

The Eagles return all four of ~

their starting defensive backs.
BC’s backfield is led by senior
strong safety Eric Shorter, who
walked on in 1991 and has
become a fixture there ever
since.

He,led BC backs with 82

P-92

tackles last season and is cur-
rently the team’s second lead-
ing tackler with 18. He also
had an interception against
Michigan.

Comerback Michael Reed’s

athletic ability makes him a
bona fide All-American candi-
date. Reed’s 5-9 size is made
up for with his 4.43 40-yard
dash speed.
‘ Cornerback Daryl Porter was
the only true freshman to start
last season for the Eagles.
Speedy junior free safety Rob
Clifford adds to the Eagles’
experience and athleticism.

“They were running to the
ball, filling gaps,” Bloom said
about BC’s swarming defense.
“They were doing everything.”

The defense will be under
extra scrutiny after starting
quarterback Mark Hartsell
broke his finger against
Virginia Tech. His lack of pres-
ence was immediately felt, as
the Eagles couldn’t put the ball
in the end zone.

Junior Jeff Ryan and fresh-
man Scott Mutryn will vie for
the starting spot against Pitt
this weekend.

“They’re going to have a
backup that’s more than capa-
ble of getting the job done,”
linebacker Tom Tumulty said.

Regardless of BC’s punch-
less offense, if it’s true that
defense wins games, then the
Eagles could be ﬂying high.

tight end in college football.
He is B.C.’s “Top Gun.” His
name  Pete Mitchell.

For most, this name does not
mean much, and to those who
have to try and stop him,
Mitchell is still mostly an
obscurity. Just ask Panther
standout linebacker Tom
Tumulty.

“I’ve heard a lot about him,
but I don’t really know that
much about him,” Tumulty
said. “I’ll know a lot more
after practices and meetings.”

Yet, for B.C. head coach
Dan Henning, it is Mitchell
who is the cornerstone of the
B.C. football team.

“He is a very stable individ-
ual in all facets of our football
team,” Henning said. “He’s a
steadying force because he is
not an erratic personality, he’s
not emotionally erratic.”

For Tumulty and the rest of

the Panther defense, their job
will be to try and contain the
senior All-American. With the
three tight-end formation the
Eagles often use, this will be a
difficult task.

“We are certainly aware of
where he is and who he is,”
Pitt head football coach
Johnny Majors said. “The mul-
tiple-formation sets puts a big
bind on [the defense].”

The formation set of the
B.C. offense is a concern for
Majors, but it is the talent of

Mitchell that is a threat.
“[He’s] an outstanding tight_

end, particularly an outstand-

ing receiver, and a decent
blocker,” Majors said. “[He is]
particularly an outstanding
receiver.”

“He is the best receiver ]
have ever seen in college foot-
ball,” Chris Collinsworth, for-
mer receiver for the Cincinnati
Bengals and current NBC
commentator, said after B.C.’s
upset last year of previously

The Pitt News, Thursday, September 22, 1994

Volleyball-

°Fr0m page P-5

“There really isn’t any pres-
sure on us against Nebraska,”
Mitchell said. “We should still
come out and play hard think-
ing that maybe we can get a
game from them.”

Pitt hopes to upset Nebraska
but is more concerned with
playing hard and being com-
petitive.

“They have great crowds in
Lincoln,” Begor said. “They
lead the nation in attendance
every year. but it is not a diffi-
cult place to play because the
crowd is friendly. They are not
a hostile group; they just like
volleyball.

“When you are playing the
No.2 team in the country, I
think you can be relaxed. I
think it’s a good opportunity to
just go out and play hard and
just let the chips fall where
they may. People’s expecta-
tions of you when you play a
team like that is nothing.
Anything you do is positive.
When we play matches like
that and like Stanford, we want

I to be able at the end of the

match to evaluate how hard
did we play and how smart did
we play and were we competi-
tive?”

The most meaningful match
this weekend is the one against
Kansas, as Pitt hopes to
avenge a loss last year tothe
Jayhawks at Fitzgerald
Fieldhouse. ,

“Hopefully we will come out
strong against Kansas,”
Mitchell said. “The fact that
we. lost to them last year, in a
way you would want to have a

ﬁght and get back at them.”

Sophomore middle hitter
Jennie Driscoll shares
Mitchell’s sentiments toward
Kansas. .“We’ve been talking
about the Kansas match for a
while, and we really want to
come out and beat them.”

Driscoll will see limited
time this weekend, as she did

not play in any of last week— '

end’s games with a sore shoul-
der.

“I’m feeling much better,”
Driscoll said. “I had a minor
setback, but I will be playing
this weekend, at least one full
match to get back into it slow.
I basically justoverdid it.

“When we played Michigan,
it was just a lot. My shoulder
not only wasn’t expecting it; it
just wasn’t really ready for it. I
did well, but at the same time
my shoulder was feeling it.”

Driscoll also feels the team
is now more together‘ and
focused and will better be able
to play up to their potential.

“I think right now we’re get-
ting into classes and stuff, and
travelling tends to be hard, but
everyone is starting to get into

' a rhythm, and people are really

starting to focus on our match-
es.” ‘

Pitt Note: Junior defensive
specialist Laura. who is
expected to miss the entire sea-
son. underwent surgery
Monday on her injured shoul-
der, and it was considered a
success.

Mitchell

°Fr0m page P-9
undefeated Notre Dame.

Mitchell,» who has become
the premier tight—end in the
nation, has been named to vir-
tually every preseason All-
America roster. His statistics
and accomplishments speak
for themselves.

As a redshirt freshman, he
backed up current Green Bay
Packer Mark Chmura, catching
29 passes that year, second-
best of any B.C. receiver
behind only Chmura.

It is Chmura’s record of 164
career receptions that Mitchell
is chasing. He needs only 30
more to surpass Chmura and
become the all—time leading
receiver in B.C. history.

In a stellar junior year, his
greatest accomplishment was a
record of 13 receptions against

Notre Dame where the Eagles

pulled off a major upset.
Finishing the year, he led the
Big East Conference in recep-
tions.

These are only a few of a

long list of impressive statis-
tics that have made him an
invaluable asset to B.C. It is
these essentials that make him
a premier NFL draft prospect.

“I think he could play on any
team that I was involved with
in the last twenty years in the
NFL,” Dan Henning, head
coach of B.C., said. “He’s also
a deep snapper, which would
make him probably worth two
salaries [in the NFL].”

Yet all of Henning’s NFL
experience may not be enough
to overcome the inexperience
of his quarterback. With starter
Mark Hartsell being out for
Saturday’s game, the inexperi-
enced QB will turn to the
experienced receiver, and that
is Mitchell.

“He can help a new quarter-
back, an old quarterback or an
in-between quarterback,”
Henning said. “He is a very
efficient pass receiver in all
facets, running routes, getting
open and catching the ball.”

The Eagles are 0-2, and

although it is still early in the
season, Mitchell seems to be
the only bright spot in B.C.’s
offense. The All—American has
amassed 126 yards on 14
receptions with one touch-
down which came in a loss to
Virginia Tech last week.

The all—everything tight end
is leading the Big East in
receptions so far this year.
Against the Hokies, Mitchell
was able to haul in four passes
though he drew double cover-
age. With the offense in a state
of chaos due to injuries, the
Eagles will have to look more
often in the direction of their
top threat. That means trouble
for the Panthers’ defense.

“I’m sure they are going to
want to use him just as any
team would with a good play-
er,” Tumulty said.

As far as double—covering
Mitchell or shadowing him
with a linebacker, Majors and
Tumulty shy away from the
idea. ’

“We don’t shadow any direct

player,” Tumulty said. “We
may adapt to a couple different
things, but we are pretty much
going to play our own
defense.”

“It is pretty difficult to really
move people around and shad-
ow someone,” Majors said.
“[If you shadow] someone,
then you give something else
up.”

Concerning the Panthers the
most will be containing
Mitchell on offense. He has
also made an impact on special
teams as the long-snapper for
the punting unit. Against the
highly ranked Michigan
Wolverines in the season open—°
er, he recorded a tackle, some-
thing he is used to receiving.

Although Mitchell is versa-
tile, being on the receiving end
of a pass is his strong suit. Just
ask Henning.

“I want to see anyone who
can catch the ball better than
he can,” Henning said.
“Mitchell is just a great col-
lege football player.”

had chances to tie late in the
game from just in front of the
goal, but it just didn’t hap-

pen.”
In goal for the Panthers was
senior goaltender Kirk

Brodows. His record now
stands at 2-2 with eight goals
allowed on the year.

“There were bad lapses by
the defense,” Astorino said.
“We score a goal and it seems
within five to 10 minutes later
we give up another goal.”

“Today’s game was disap-
pointing,” Prex said. “The
team is in disarray right now
and has got to get things
together. The mood has got to
change.”

The Panthers return to Big
East conference action when
they host the Villanova
Wildcats on Sunday at Pitt
Stadium.

“We have to win that one,”
Porter said. “They are a weak-
er team in the Big East, and it
is important for us to come
out on top.”

Time is of the essence for
Fitzgerald and the offense. If
they can hold the ball and use
the clock, the Panther defense
will have the luxury of staying
fresh instead of tiring out by
the second quarter. This season,
Pitt’s opponents have had the
ball for over nine and a half
longer than the
Panthers. That is a long time
for a defense to be on the field.

“When the defense isn’t
doing well, the offense has to
step up and do it,” Bloom said.

“They will be coming in

“Hayes has unbelievable hit-
ting ability,” Tumulty said. “You
don’t know where it comes from
just all of a sudden — BOW——
just knock somebody out.”
“McCray’s also a big hitter,”
Tumulty added. “He comes up
and just ﬂat out busts you up.”
Another quote on the back of
the “Pitt Bulls” shirt reads, “Say
what you mean, and mean what
you say.” And to a man, the Pitt
linebackers will tell you that the
relationships between them are
more than just that of team-

“If it’s not like brothers,”
Clark said, “then it’s like first
cousins or something.”

And thattype of closeness
translates into conﬁdence on the
ﬁeld.

“We have a belief in each
other where you know the other
guy is going to do his job,”
Simpson said. “You have no
doubt in your mind.”

Yet another saying on the back
of the “Pitt Bul1s” shirt reads,
“No feat. Defeat.” And despite
the rebuilding status of the pro-
gram that leaves the club over-

“It’s that pit bull attitude,”
Simpson said. “We will never
give up; we’11 always stay in the
ﬁght.”

Oft times that ﬁght is a strug-
gle.

“I mean think about it,”
Chavis said. “You’re crazy to go
out and take on a 300‘-pound
lineman and then go chase down
a4.5, 40.”

Describing a linebacker as
crazy is almost cliché, so Chavis
added a different take on his
position. -

“Playing linebacker is like a

remain calm.”

That’s quite a paradox. It’s
kind of like that old pit bull, one
minute he’s letting you pet his
head, and before you know it,
he’s dangling from your fore-
arm, his teeth sunk into your
muscle.

“We’re trying to be like pit
bulls,” Simpson said. “You
know how they constantly attack
and lock and never miss‘? Well
we’re trying to constantly attack
and never miss a tackle.”

Somebody should ﬁt these
guys’ necks for studded collars.
