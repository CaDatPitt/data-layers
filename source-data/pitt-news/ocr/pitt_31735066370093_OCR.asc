Computer
Faire Aims

e To Educate

A three-day Computer Faire will
be held at Pitt from Tuesday
November 29 till December I and
will feature “state-of-the-art” equip-
ment, representatives from 20
manufacturers and lectures geared
at educating the public, according to
University Computer Center
spokespeople.

“Its going to be interesting to a lot
of people, not just those familiar in
the technical aspect (ofcomputers)."
Manager of State and User Com-
munications, Jinx Walton, said.

Representatives from IBM Cor-
poration, Apple Computers and
Hewlett-Packard Corporation, to
name a few, will be displaying their
wares in Forbes Quadrangle. Com-
pany representatives will be on hand
to answer questions and display the
equipment.

Some highlights of the three-day
event include a computer chess tour-
nament, sponsored by the Pitt Pro-
gram Council; a computer art show
in the William Pitt Union’s Art
Gallery; discussion groups in the
Union's Kurtzman Room and a ser-
ies of lectures.

Walton said the Computer Faire
has been in the works for close to a
year, and the manufacturer’s repre-
sentatives were contacted within the
last month. Chuck Glassmire, the
Center's Micro-
Computer Coordinator, was the
event’s coordinator, although he
gave more ofthe credit for the Faire
to Dr. Paul A. Stieman, the Univer-
sity Computer Center’s Director.
Glassmire said the Center is antici-
pating a crowd of “about 5,000."

The Computer Faire is open to all
members of the university and the
general public.

Lectures will feature speakers
approaching both the technical and
practical viewpoints ofthe computer
age, Walton said. Of the 20 lectures
scheduled, one each day has been
designated as a “keynote speech."
These are:

0 Tuesday, November 29 -- “Arti-
ficial Reality." Dr. Myron Krueger,
Professor of Computer Science at
the University of Connecticut will
speak on the positive aspects of the
human/ computer interaction.

0 Wednesday. November 30 ~-
“Campus-wide Network: The
CMU/ IBM Project." Dr. Wilfred J.
Hansen, Systems Designer for the
Information Technology Center at
CMU, will outline a joint effort to
develop a campus-wide network of
personal computers.

Students Choose Bold E
New Academic Directions

By WALTER OATES

Mary Schmidt, assistant director
of advising at Pitt, remembers one
enterprising Pitt student who, when
faced with the prospect of not find-
ing any of the computer classes she
wanted open, attempted to cross-
register for IS computer science
credits at Carnegie-Mellon
University.

That wasn’t quite what its organ-
izers had in mind when the cross-
registration program was started.
The program, a division of the Pitts-
burgh Council of Higher Education
(PCHE), enables Pitt undergradu-
ates to take advantage of course
offerings at any one of the l0 other
colleges and universities in the area.

A student usually takes courses at
another college when the desired
course is not available at his own
school. Up to six credits can be
cross-registered credits can count
towards graduation.

At Pitt, students are not encour-
aged to take sequential courses at

Senior Terry Lackatlas, a transfer
from Pitt-Johnstown, came to Pitt
with an interest in an organizational
psychology major. Pitt didn‘t have
all the courses necessary to obtain a
major in this field, which has to do
with the psychology of business
administration and management.
Lackatlas, with the help of her advi-
sor, Dr. Richard Moreland, found
the classes that she needed at CMU.
Now she is taking administration
and managementclasses there to ful-
fill the major.

“It is a great eaxperience,” Lack-
atlas said. “More people should do
it.“

Some Pitt students choose to take
dance classes at Point Park College,
as some CMU studio arts students
take art history courses at Pitt (since
CMU‘s art history program is rather
weak).

Eligibility

NCAA Tackles Problem

By MARK A. SINDLER

When the National Collegiate
Athletic Association holds its
annual convention next January in
Dallas, the delegates might well
forget to pack their business suits
and opt instead for numbered jer-
seys and helmets.

It will be a showdown of sorts
when the 278 representatives from
NCAA Division I-A and I-AA
schools sit down and start tackling
the highly-controversial issue of
freshman eligibility in major college
basketball and football. Few dis-
agree that it is a legitimate question
to be addressed, though each has
various ideas for dealing with the
problem.

Pitt will be one of those institu-
tions represented as part of a com-
mittee that has spent the last 16
months reviewing eligibility and sev-
eral other topics of concern, includ-
ing governance, recruiting and
finances. The committee was estab-
lished by the NCAA Council, the
group's 46-member governing
board.

The Select Committee on Athletic
Problems and Concerns in Higher
Education, comprising 16 university
presidents, chancellors, faculty
representatives and coaches, did not
reach’ a unanimous decision on the
matter. It did, however, submit a
report to the NCAA Council. Chan-
cellor Wesley Posvar, a representa-
tive on the committee, voted against
the elimination of freshman
eligibility.

The committee, headed by former’

Arizona president John P. Schaefer,
was founded primarily to alleviate
what the council sees as the dilemma
of student-athletes, resulting from a
“combination of possible under-
preparation for academic success
and over-commitment to athletic
endeavors."

The council wants to make the
athlete’s integration from high
school to college as smooth as possi-
ble by balancing the demands of
academia and athletics.

But it does not support the select
committee’s findings and will not
sponsor the committee’s eligibility
bill on the convention floor in Dal-
las. In part, the committee recom-
mended that freshmen not be
permitted to participate in varsity
competition but that they should

have three years of eligibility
remaining after competing onjunior
varsity squads in their first year.

Student-athletes will have four
years to complete the three years of
varsity competition.

By far, this is not the first time the
helmeted minds of top university
administrators will clash over this
well-trodden question mark. After
freshmen wereﬁrst declared eligible
in the early l930s, a ban was later
established until the World War II
draft necessitated bodies on the
field. I

Since then, the proverbial eligibil-
ity ball has been moved up and down
the field with a ban again coming
until reinstatement of eligibility in
the late l960s. Now, a decade later,
freshmen eligibility faces an uncer-
tain third-and—long situation.

The committee also recom-
mended that the total number of
Division I-A football scholarships
permitted to be offered be raised
from 95 to I04 overall but lowered
from 30 to 26 on a per-year basis. In
basketball, the limit would be
increased by one from the present 15
to I6.

Despite the council's refusal to
sponsor the bill, it can still be intr'o-
duoed by any group of six or more
schools. Pitt athletic director
Edward Bozik, however, believes
the committee's recommendations
are not strong enough to pass should
such an attempt be made.

“I think it’s an issue that needs to
be reviewed very carefully," Bozik
said.

Bozik stands unconvinced that
the student-athlete excels any differ-
ently than the non-athlete, Posvar’s
vote on the committee belying the
stance.

“First ofall, it remains to be dem-
onstrated that freshmen in football
and basketball performed atany less
of a rate of academic success than
their non-athletic counterparts,"
Bozik said. “Number two, I know
from my own personal experience
that freshmen athletes do better than
sophomore athletes thanjunior ath-
letes than senior athletes.

“Perhaps they‘re under the gun
and a little more frightened, a little
less blase, a little less jaded."

Moreover, Bozik pointed out that
student-athletes would still compete
in either sport with as much practice

Ergonomics

Adapﬁngto

By AUDREY GLASS

Office automation has arrived
at Pitt in a big way with the
recent signing of an agreement
between Pitt and the Xerox Cor-
poration that will bring state-of-
the-art equipment to the
university.

A new science called ergonom-
ics has emerged to better define
the relationship between workers
and their office environments.
Ergonomics # deﬁned —— means
the science that seeks to adapt
the environment of work or
working conditions to suit the
worker.

This concept is also applicable

_ to the teaching and studying pro-

cesses involving video display

terminal (VDT) work and study

the Working

stations. Similar concerns have
been raised by students and pro-
fessionals in the fields of compu-
ter science and information
science. With the evolving tech-
nologies come associated health
and productivity problems.

The National Institute for
Occupational Safety and Health
has shown that health-related
problems are 20-30 percent
higher among VDT users.

Manufacturers are now mar-
keting ergonomically designed
furniture for use with VDTS,
keyboards, printers and such.
The market is overloaded with a
variety of types and sizes of fur-
niture that may be adaptable to
the individual's physical charac-
teristics. Most people, however.
don't know what the size oftheir

Place

work station should be to avoid
back and shoulder strain and to
promote their maximum
productivity.

To see this more clearly, an
analogy can be drawn to an ath-
lete. The track star would face ‘
serious productivity problems
were he to be fitted incorrectly
for running shoes. The supplier
of ergonomically designed furni-
ture, however, unlike the shoe
salesman, is not trained to find
the proper fit, (i.e., to adjust the
furniture to suit each individual).
This needs to be done by special
consultants trained to evaluate,
recommend and instruct the user
on the appropriate specifica-
tions.

needed for and time devoted to var-
sity play. .

“What do they actually gain?" he
asked rhetorically. “I’m not con-
vinced that you're going to save
them any time in terms of time they
devote to [either sport].“

Finally, a cost equation is entered
into the proposed changes. The
addition ofabout nine more football
scholarships would cost the univer-
sity an additional $54,000. But it
would not necessarily stop there.

“It's a relatively trivial amount of
money,” Bozik said. “Its not trivial-
...but [we] actually carry more than
95 [currently]. It is our policy that if
you're injured, your scholarship car-
ries all the way through."

The money involved could actu-
ally reach six figures. The overriding
point still is evidence showing
student-athletes are a single group
who can't make the grade through
‘college due to varsity athletics.

“I am very much in agreement
with the view of the select commit-

tee.” Bozik said, “that there are
indeed problems and concerns there
[for student-athletes]. I don't think,
as the chancellor does, that they’re
as bad as some reports would have
them be. On the other hand, [the
problems] are serious enough to
warrant institutional as well as
national concern on the part of the
NCAA."

There is a current survey being
conducted by a Virginia firm that is
questioning approximately 60-70
Division I schools, including Pitt. Its
final report will not be available
until April 1984, but a progress
update will be presented at the Dal-
las convention. Bozik, however.
wants to wait for the real thing.

“It’s a question on which honest
men can disagree," he admitted.
“My only point and the chancellor's
only point is. ‘Please, ladies and gen-
tlemen, let's get the evidence.’ Right
now we’re operating on something
slightly better than intuitive judg-
ment on this thing, but is it really
that critical that the issue be decided

at the I984 convention‘? Let's wait
and see the evidence.“

One who is directly affected by the
question of eligibility is Pitt head
basketball coach Roy Chipman. He
is entering his fourth year as coach
of the Panthers and senses a certain
degree of paranoia.

“Sometimes you overreact," he
said. “They say more kids are
transferring because they are
unhappy, so they leave. I don’t know
if that makes it right [to single ath-
letes out or possible academic
conflicts].

“They may be unhappy or caught
in a bad situation, but I would like to
see the evidence first that shows they
are doing poorly in class."

Where both Bozik and Chipman
view eligibility from one vantage
point, a separate point of view is
supported by West Coast schools.
Spearheading that drive is UCLA
Chancellor Charles E. Young. Most
schools in the mountain and coast
states rely heavily upon junior col-

continued from page one

In the past, ergonomics has
been used to design new products
or to evaluate work environ-
ments in different areas of
human activity such as airport
control towers, the pilot cockpit
and industrial assembly lines.
More recently however, ergo-
nomic engineering principles
have been applied to minimize
the discomfort and promote effi-
ciency of people in the office
automation environment.

Applied Ergonomics Com-
pany in Pittsburgh has provided
ergonomic adjustments and
redesign for the management ser-
vices department at the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh.

Jane Sutton, a Pitt secretary,
said, “I had never given much
thought to my ‘work posture’

New Science Analyzes Work Place

until the ergonomic consultant
serviced my work area. I now
realizejust how uncomfortable it
really was.

“I feel the consultant has
helped me tremendously, and
therefore, my work is more
pleasant.”

In 1981, the Food and Drug
Administration, which regulates
X-ray devices, gave the VDT a
clean bill of health. This report
has been criticized by experts,
however, many of whom believe
that most ailments reported by
VDT workers result from a “lack
of fit between worker and work
environment.”

Not taking anything away
from the attractiveness of office
automation, in order to gain the
maximum benefit, one must

learn his physical requirements
and characteristics in relation to
his equipment.

Having the environment ergo-
nomically evaluated is the last
step in ensuring that the equip-
ment is being installed in such a
way as to meet its potential.

While serving as an intern for
Applied Ergonomics Company,
I have had the opportunity to
speak with several operations
managers. I find that most man-
agers who are now subjects ofthe
change to automation don’t want
to bother with this problem. In
large corporations, it seems to be
a question of who should be
responsible for the comfort and
well-being of the personnel. Is it
the purchasing department or
human resources department?

lege transfers and tend to almost dis-
regard eligible freshmen.

Not only do schools such as
UCLA start their football season in
early September, one month before
most PAC-10 schools begin their fall
terms, but the conference teams
themselves carry self-imposed res-
trictions limiting football scholar-
ships to 90 per team for economic
purposes, five below the current
ceiling.

So perhaps it is understandable
why Young will likely make an
attempt at organizing the necessary
six schools to carry the eligibility
legislation in Dallas.

“Chancellor Young last year chal-
lenged Chancellor Posvar to look at
the transcripts of the entering fresh-
men class in football and basket-
ball," Bozik recalled. "[Posvar] went
one step further and wanted a ran-
dom sample out of CAS.“

What the random sampling that
Bozik and several others was that
the particular entering class of fresh-
men included student-athletes who
performed better (compared to the
class average) than non-athletes and
who carried no failing grades.

“I hate to be repetitive, but there
has yet to be presented to me a corre-
lation between poor academic out-
put and those gifted with
exceptional athletic ability,” Bozik
said. “Any evidence we’ve been able
to turn up, micro as it might be,
shows otherwise. If evidence can be
brought forward to that effect, I
would accept it.”

Not straying from that lack-of-
evidence stance, Chipman goes just
a little further, maintaining that the
NCAA currently rules what athletes
can and cannot do to the point that
athletes become lawbreakers.

It's a process of turning out
reverse results.

“The biggest problem with
student-athletes is that they are
being treated in an unrealistic
manner," Chipman said. “An exam-
ple are the rules legislated by the
NCAA. They leave athletes caught
in a Catch-22. The NCAA stipulates
you can give him room, board,
books and tuition, but no work or
transportation.

“They are so concerned about an
education to keep him here in the
spring and summer that it is illegal to
find a job. Where the hell can he get
the money to be a college student? It
becomes a survivalistic situation
that makes him do illegal things.”

Chipman underscored the fact
that when student athletes are led to
extremes beyond NCAA by laws,
academics may suffer in the process.
Examples Chipman outlines here
include visiting ill parents who live
far distances from school and being
able to conduct a social life when
money from home is in short supply.

Eliminate some ofthat legislation
(all contained in a complex, 395-
page manual), he concluded, and S-
As will unlikely suffer academic ills
apparent today.

“The rules are often times unreal-
istic in terms of what's going on in
the world," Chipman said. “It seems
to me there’s got to be a way they can
be treated well. We can even give
them money. Not all would apply
for that, but you can usea need—basis
to determine who would qualify. As
it is now, it’s unjust.”

Bozik said that the committee’s
current recommendations, if passed
in whole today, would work in a
reverse manner, similar to how
today‘s NCAA‘s rules “condone"
illicit practices.

“If you’re going to recruit a young
man,” Bozik said, “and he's a blue-
chipper, he's got no incentive to
come in academically prepared
because he can then spend the year
only losing practice in sub-varsity
competition and be eligible, if he
meets institutional standards, the
following year.

“That kind oftakes the fang out of
eligibility a little bit.”

As the clock winds down to con-
vention time, Bozik is confident that
the select committee’s proposal on
freshmen eligibility will not pass.
But he also said he “could live with
it” should a two-thirds majority not
overrule any action and the bill be
accepted.

“As a practical matter, I’m not all
that uptight about it," Bozik dis-
closed. “If it passes, it passes, and if
the evidence demonstrates that-
...that proponents are right, so be it.
We’ll let it stand. If it’s wrong, we’ll
go back to the boards.”

One extra shove from another
group just might keep the proposals
from becoming a reality.

“Understand that not only are
Division I-A schools voting here,"
Bozik continued. “Some of the
poorer Division I-AA institutions
may find the financial argument per-
suasive: the less financially well-
endowed schools.”

The final score won’t be deter-
mined until mid-January.

The procedure for cross-
registration is simple enough. A stu-
dent must first register himself as a
full-time Pitt student (which means
12 credits). The student, after con-
sulting the course guides and time
schedules of the institution at which
he wants to take a class, adds, during
the add/drop period, up to six cred-
its at the other school. He takes his
request for cross—registration and
necesary forms to the registrar to be
processed.

Students interested in cross-
registration should well realize that
all schools fill their classes with their
own students first, and a student
must be aware of the difference in
the time—schedule for the beginning
and ending of each term.

For instance, CMU’s spring term,
which coincides with Pitt’s winter
term, ends in May. whereas Pitt’s
ends in April. Therefore. a student
taking a course at CMU during the
spring term should realize he’s going
to have to spend some added time in
Pittsburgh in order to take his final.

American labor is being tested once again with the four-  °

~ Nicaragua

   

By MARTY WILLIS

Is the Reagan Administration
planning to invade Nicaragua, as the
Nicaraguan government has been
saying for the last two weeks? lfso, it
will be the single biggest mistake in
American foreign policy since the
Vietnam conflict.

Nicaragua has already sent home
some l,200 Cuban technicians and
teachers within the last week.
Another l,000 Cubans, mostly mil-
itary advisers, wilkleave in the next
week, according to an Associated
Press report yesterday.

The reason for this unprecedented
move, the Sandinistas say, is “so the
United States has no pretext to
invade." Though such an attack
seems far-fetched, especially to
Americans, several recent news
events indicate that is could easily
happen — and soon.

First and foremost in the reason-
ing of the Nicaraguans is the fact
that their country IS already in a
state of war. The U.S. Central Intel-

liberals) has been providing arms,
money and training for almost two
years to an army of about l0,000
anti-Sandinista guerillas based in
Honduras and Costa Rica.

This “contra," or counterrevolu-
tionary, army has repeatedly
invaded Nicaraguan territory, and it
recently blew up the country’s only
oil refinery in its stated effort to
further cripple the already stagger-
ing economy. But the Nicaraguan
army is under orders not to pursue
the contras across the Honduran
border, apparently because it would
provide a gift-wrapped excuse for
Washington to go to war ifany ofits
numerous advisers or soldiers were
martyred in the crossfire.

A month ago, the Grenadian
government announced on radio for
two solid days that the U.S. was
about to attack. Of course, Pen-
tagon officials denied the charge
initially. On Oct. 25, however, the
world learned the sad truth. Now
that Managua is announcing the
same thing, skeptics should consider
that the last time this cry was heard,
it turned out to be accurate.

The next signal that an invasion of
Nicaragua may be imminent came a
few weeks ago, and it was subtle
indeed. Secretary of Defense Caspar
Weinberger, speaking on national
television, “refused to rule out"
overt military action against the
socialist nation. Many American
liberals, keeping in mind the milita-
ristic track record ofthe administra-
tion, began to fear the worst.

COLUMN

It was only 10 days ago that some
1,200 U.S. Marines carried out “a
Grenada-style practice landing" on
two Honduran beaches and that the
Sandinistas first charged the U.S.
with planning to invade and began
to rush the Cubans out of the coun-
try. Earlier that week, Managua had
assured U.S. ambassador Anthony
Quainton that it would guarantee
the safety of all American citizens in
the country —- even if attacks by

according to The I_’ittsburgh Press.

The most recent source of worry
came within the last week when
Congress adjourned until January.
Some observers have maintained
that the perfect time for Ronald
Reagan to do exactly what he wants
in Central America is when Con-
gress. which would demand an
explanation at the very least, is out
of session.

The task of taking and holding
Nicaragua, in purely military terms,
would be infinitely more difficult
than the surprisingly sticky business
of occupying tiny Grenada.
Moreover, it could easily lead to a
bloody war for El Salvador, which
would probably spill over into Hon-
duras and Guatemala.

In terms of international politics
such a war would represent a gigan-
tic setback in American-Soviet rela-
tions, which have worsened in recent
weeks over the most important issue
ofall, arms control. Western Europe
would be hard pressed, to endorse

American adventurism. The domes-
tic reaction, too, would likely be
lukewarm at best.

What Americans need least in
these times is another war. And a
Central American bloodbath, with
its potential for prolonged commit-
ment and escalation, could become
frighteningly similar to the tragedy
of 20 years ago in Indochina. One
wonders if this country has learned
enough to avoid a repeat of the dis-
astrous experience.

A very large clue toward answer-
ing that question will be found in
next year’s presidential election. If
Reagan wins again, the near future
might well be even grimmer than the
recent past.

Guards Lead Pitt
to 86-56 Win

By rooo ERKEL

All of what could be called excit-
ing quickly came and went late in the
second half when freshman Curtis
Aiken sent an alley-oop pass in the
direction of the field house ceiling,
where Pitt guard Bryan Mitchell was
soaring. The ensuing rim shaker ofa
dunk reminded the 5,000 since-
sedated fans that there was still a
basketball game being played,
although the outcome had long since
been decided.

Opening games have never been
predicated on their entertainment

(value, and Saturday's charade
against Westminster, won by the
Panthers 86-56, was no exception.

Westminster, behind the strong
inside play of 6-6 freshman Rich
Kunselman, remained within reach
of a miracle at the half, but the
Panthers slowly built a I6-point half
time lead to 20 and then 30 in the
second half, turning the game into
the stretching exercise it was meant

‘to be.

“We accomplished what we
wanted to do," said Pitt head coach
Roy Chipman. “We wanted to score
at least 85 points, and we wanted to
hold them to under 60.

“I was pleased with the guards. I
felt they played real well, especially
when it counted."

Most of what counted came in the
first halfwhen point guard Billy Cul-
bertson continucd to show a new-
found interest in shooting the
basketball. Culbertson hit on two

long jumpers and finished the half
with eight points.

"I'm shooting much better." Cul-
bertson said. “I came into this sea-
son wanting to increase my scoring
average and to become a better
passer.”

Culbertson handed-off five assists
in the first half and committed only
one turnover. His performance sat
well with Chipman, who stands
ready with a platoon of capable
back-ups at the guard position.

“Tonight, Billy was good. but he
can be better than that." Chipman
said. "The only question is whether
he will shoot the ball, and he has
done that.

“If he continues to shoot the ball
the way he has, the way he did in
high,school, it will be tough to get
him out of the lineup."

Culbertson‘s offense took some of
the heat off of Clyde Vaughan, who
was followed, clutched and all but
smothered by Westminster's 6-2
senior guard Craig Randall in a box
and one defense. Vaughan still man-
aged 21 points to lead all Panther
scorers.

Vaughan’s most glaring statistic,
though, fell in the assist box where
he contributed three. After collect-
ing only 28 assists last season,
Vaughan made an off—season reli-
gion out of improving his passing
and ball handling.

“Clyde’s improvement has given
us an extra passer,“ Chipman said.

Stock in Chipman‘s recruiting ofa
year ago rose sharply with the play

difficult now that the delivery of
services is expected.

Pitt‘s Marlon Ferguson and
Westminster‘s Les Ward began
their college basketball careers
Saturday on the ends of oppos-
ing benches, but before the final
buzzer sounded, glimpses ofwhy
both were among the Western
Pennsylvania Interscholastic

Athletic League's (WPIAL)
most—sought talents last year
emerged.

Ferguson sat patiently

through 30 minutes of basketball
and watched his teammates
slowly run away from the under-
si7ed Westminster team. Then,
the game well in hand, Pitt head
coach Roy Chipman looked
down his bench and called for the
lanky. 6-7, I87-lb. center-
turning—forward who came to
Pitt from Center High School via
every all-star team in the state.

Ferguson‘s first officialactasa
Panther came at 8:l5 in the
second half. when he swatted the
first Westminster shot headed his
way. He blocked a follow-up try
minutes later and then another.
to the delight of a Field House
crowd, which put offthoughts of
a quick exit to the parking lot to
see the new kid do his thing.

Ward. who last year led his
Hampton High School team to
the Class AA semi—finals of the
WPIAL playoffs, spent most of
the evening dodging full-court
pressure from the Pitt guards
and protecting his smallish, 5-1 I.
I55-lb. frame from the likes of
Clyde Vaughan and Keith
Armstrong.

The two met at center court
afterward to offer each other
encouragement and to replay a
memory or two. They became
friends during the two all—star
games they played on together
last year. Both agreed things had
changed.

“It is a lot different than high
school." Ward said. “There is

Differently Now

such a mental adjustment to
make in college.“

Both Ferguson and Ward are
adjusting to new positions as
well. Ferguson has moved from
center to forward while West-
minster coach Ron Galbreath
has been grooming Ward as a
future shooting guard instead of
his accustomed point guard spot.

“I am starting to play more
relaxed now," Ferguson said. “I
am starting to get more comfor-
table with the system."

Ward thought by choosing a
smaller school he could make the
transition from high school to
college ball easier. It hasn't been.

“It hit me,“ Ward said of the
difference between high school
and college. “I expected it to be
much easier."

The players realize the differ-
ence quickly, but sometimes
their friends and family expect
the success of high school to
automatically transfer to college.

“The people that are really
close to me understand,“ Ward
said. “But some people expect
too much."

Ferguson has quietly excepted
his role as a reserve. and he has
been working to improve both
his game and his body. He wants
eventually to build himself up to
225 lbs.

"He is out there after practice
for 45 minutes or an hour every
day,” Chipman said. "There‘s is
no doubt; he is going to be an
excellent player."

Ferguson began to prove that
prophecy correct with his defen-
sive side-show on Saturday.

“In high school. I was
expected to do that." he said.
“My coach stressed that part of
my game. I think I can continue
to do that."

Chipman will find it nice to
know that as different as high
school and college basketball
might be. some things remain the
same.

Lady
Panthers
Doubled
Up 65-63

By SCOTT DELLETT

There is little doubt the Lady
Panther basketball team is thankful
for Jennifer Bruce, its junior All-
America candidate. However, the
team's sole dependence upon her to
supply the offense has the potential
to create problems.

This happened Saturday night at
the Fitzgerald Field House as Indi-
ana edged the Lady Panthers 65-63
in a see-saw affair. Even though
Bruce scored 20 points, the Hoosiers
constantly had two players looking
over her every move.

And Pitt did not have the outside
shooting to relieve the pressure on
Bruce, as the Lady Panthers hit only
39 percent from the ﬂoor. Add to
that 27 turnovers ~ most of them
caused from forcing passes unsuc-
cessfully inside to Bruce —- and one
could wonder why the margin was
only two points.

“We didn’t take advantage of the
double team the entire night,” Lady
Panther head coach Judy Saurer
said. “We need to hit from the out-
side more to free Jennifer from the
double team.

“We have to be more patient on
the offense and Jennifer has to con-
tend with being double-teamed all
year."

The Lady Panthers held a I0-
point lead ~ 50-40 -— at the l4:52
mark of the second half but could
not score for the next six minutes as
Indiana scored I3 unanswered
points.

One area with which Saurer was
impressed was the defense. which
held the Hoosiers to 65 points —— a
relatively low number considering
the use of the 30-second clock in
women's basketball.

“The kids did well defensively,"
she said. “We like to hold teams to
under 60 points, and when you hold
a team like Indiana to 65. that‘s a
real good job.“

A player who benefited from the
success on defense was guard Lisa
Fubio. The sophomore transfer
from Connecticut scored l5 points
- most on layups off steals from the
I-3-I half-court press —-~- as the Lady
Panthers had I7 thefts.

But a problem has been exposed
from the loss; Bruce can not carry
the Lady Panthers herself. A second
threat, a role held by forward Pam
Miklasevich last season, is needed.

“We need a balanced attack and
not to depend on Jennifer to supply
all of the scoring," Saurer said.

A start will be tommorrow night's
contest against Youngstown State at
the Field House. The Penouins are

l-l so far this season, beating Akron
and losing to Cleveland State by
four points.

‘You can expect a track meet."
Saurer said. “Youngstown State has
a guard-orientated offense and they
run all the time.“

Schedule in Way of
Saurer, Her Goals

By LAURIE KUBLI

Despite the fact that nearly the
entire first half of the Pitt women's
basketball season will be battled out
in the Fitzgerald Field House, head
coach Judy Saurer believes that this
year‘s schedule is conceivably the
team's most stern in her four-year
stint with the Lady Panthers.

“The schedule is awesome, just
awful," Saurer said, “but I'm look-
ing forward to the season. The
[games] on the road will be
extremely tough, and the fact that
we don't have any seniors may hurt

V9

US.

The team, which ended the I982-
83 season l7-l l with adisappointing
loss in the first round ofthe Big East
tournament to the Georgetown,
opened the I983-84 season with an
impressive performance, humiliat-
ing Fairmont State 100-55 last Tues-
day at the Field House.

Indiana ( I9-l I last season), one of
I6 teams with winning records that
the Lady Panthers will encounter in
the I983-84 campaigmcametotown
over the Thanksgiving weekend and
nipped Pitt 65-63.

Ohio State. representing the Big
Ten conference, visits the Lady
Panthers on December 10. The Lady
Buckeyes were 23-5 in '82-83.

The first true road challenge for
the Lady Panthers comes on Jan. 4
when Pitt faces Tennessee, 25-8 last
year.

This season’s bout with arch-rival
Penn State will be decided at Uni-
versity Park at the tailend of Pitt‘s
schedule. Last season, the Lady
Lions finished 26-7 on the strength
of their 6-3 center Kahadeejah Her-
bert, who was named the Atlantic I0
Tournament MVP.

Saurer, who is 53-33 at Pitt in her
three years, maintains that the
squad‘s biggest challenge will be fil-
ling the void left by the graduation

of Pam Miklasevich. who was
second in team scoring (17.0) and
rebounding (7.3) a year ago.

Lack of height is another problem
facing the Lady Panthers. Five of
§aurer‘s players top six feet. but she
contends that her team IS relatively
small.

"West Virginia and Georgetown
each have a player 6-7," Saurer said.
“We will be really small until Jen-
nifer Tyner is eligible in January.“

Tyner is a 6-5 transfer from Nor-
theast Louisiana.

Pitt's premier player is 6-0 junior
forward Jennifer Bruce, who was
recently selected the Big East pre-
season Player of the Year. The Pitts-
burgh native and graduate of nearby
Carrick High School averaged 20.6
points per game and 9.6 rebounds
per game while serving as one the
team’s tri-captains.

“I’m sure [Bruce] will be one of
our strengths," Saurer said. Bruce

»Lady Panthers To Face stringent Opponents

continued from page eight
has collected 48 points in her first
two games this season.

Another to aid the Lady Panther
cause will be Ellen Gilhooley, a 6-0
junior forward from Avoca, Pa.

Three freshmen round out the
team’s six-foot club.

Forward Julie Callan “will defi-
nitely help out,” according to
Saurer. The 6-1 Chicagoan scored

21 ppg and grabbed eight rpg for
Willowbrook High School.

Ontario native 6-2 Patricia Paul
will probably hold down the center
spot and switch to forward when
Tyner becomes eligible.

Forward Pam Novosel, b-2, hails
from West Forest High School in
Tionesta, Pa.

.Pitt’s fourth rookie, Jane Plake,
will see a lot of playing time, Saurer
said. Plake, 5-10, led nearby Serra

Catholic in scoring with an 18.4
average and will play either guard or
forward for the Lady Panthers.

Saurer said that the strength of
this season’s team will come from
the guard position by virtue of its
quickness and scoring potential.

“I think we’re a little faster this
year,” Saurer said. “We have fine
shooters in Stephanie Collins and
Kim Tirik, who have phenomenal
range. This should make for more
balanced scoring.”

Collins is a 5-8 junior from Gai-
thersburg, Md., who had her best
scoring performance when she tal-
lied 18 points.

Tirik, a 5-8 sophomore, was the
only Lady Panther, aside from
Bruce, to play in all 28 regular sea-
son games last year.

Tirik handled the point guard
duties and led the team in assists
with 116.

Others ‘supplying depth at the
guard position are Becky Maziarz,

Lisa Fubio and Kim Gannis. Mazi-
arz, a 5-10 guard from Meadville,
Pa., contributed ﬁve ppg and two
rpg as she appeared in 25 of the Lady

Panthers’ contests last season.
Sophomore transfer Fubio, 5-10,
has totaled 30 points in her first two
contests with Pitt.

Gannis is 5-7. She played her high
school basketball at Brentwood
High School, a perennial WPIAL
AA powerhouse.

Saurer said that there will be a

re-emphasis on defense, even though.

she sees herself as an offensive
coach.

“This year we are pushing defense
a lot more than in the past, and the
players have been very receptive to
it,” Saurer said. “Our assistant
coach, Carol Dugan, has been

emphasizing multiple defenses. I
believe we will improve our defense
without sacrificing our offense.

“Pressure defense is really impor-
tant, and we have the personnel to
play it and maintain the intcnsitv ”

Among Saurer’s goals are win-
ning 20 games and the Big East title,
in addition to increasing home
attendance, and “creating a more
positive image of the woman?
athlete.”

Goals for Saurer, however, do not
necessarily translate into forecasts.
“I don’t like to make predictions.
We’ll take things one game at a
time.”

of both Aiken and 0-7 freshman
Marlon Ferguson. The two showed
ﬂashes of untapped brilliance and
managed to keep the Panther faith-
ful out ofthe parking lotand in their
seats late in the game with their
respective passing and shot blocking
displays.

Ferguson's defense. to use a Chip-
man phrase. was "very active."
something that couldn't be said of
the Pitt defense in the early going.
The Panthers started the game in a
man-to-man and confronted a prob-
lem thatshouldn‘t occurtoo often»-
they were too big. Andre Williams,
the 6-8 Panther forward. found him-
self out beyond the key. chasing
Westminster‘s version of a forward
-- all 6—l of him.

“I would like to see him become a
little more active on defense." Chip-
man said of Williams. “He’s strug-

. SAVG

‘ ‘one cpuoon per order

gling more with the defensive
adjustment from playing center to
playing forward.“

But Chipman stressed that Willi-
ams is finally at the forward position
to stay and that he and his staff are
"committed to playing the big guy
[Keith Armstrong] at the center
spot."

Armstrong appeared at times to
be searching for his defensive feet in
his first regular season start of his
career. However. he did go to the
basket with strains of finesse. some-
thing that could not be said last
season.

"We have to work on getting the
ball inside to Keith," Chipman said.

"A couple of times on the break. he‘

ran hard and posted himself. He'll
stop running after a while if we don‘t
give him the ball."

Robinson, who has seemingly fallen
out of Chipman‘s immediate plans.
gave reason for guarded optimism in
their first performance of a long
season.

"We hope that by the time the Big
East play begins. they will be ready
to play." Chipman said.

Between now and the Panthers
Big East opener on Jan. 4. the
Panthers will play teams slightly bet-
ter than Westminster but none that
will be confused with the likes of
Georgetown. .

Culbertson thinks it‘s time the
Panthers learn how to be the giant
instead of the ant.

“There is no doubt that we are
going to have to crush some teams."
he said. “Instead of other teams put-
ting fear into our minds, we are
going to have to put fear in theirs.“

Westminster left Pittsburgh with
a 30-point bruise on its record, but
little fear went with them.
