Regular Edition

Actors For Next
Players Drama
Selected By Cass

Tumpson, Beverley Brown Lead
In Play-Within-Play Melodrama
Where Duel Ends In Tragedy

Twelve members of the cast of the

,Rice-Barry “Cock Robin” by Pitt Play-

-ers’ mystery thriller scheduled for
production March 25 and 26 at the
Pittsburgh Civic Playhouse, were ap-
pointed yesterday by Carl B. Cass,
faculty director of Players.

Those assigned roles were Ellis
Tumpson, BA36; Joseph Madden, C36;
Arthur Kelley, C37; Oscar Goodstein,
C39; John Baker, C36; Helen Aker-
man, C36; Beverley Brown, C37; Jo-
seph VVasel, C36; Meyer Rabinovitz,
C39; Robert McKee, C38; Jeannette
Swartz, C38; and Ola McGrai1, C36.

“Cock Robin” happens to be the
nickname of one Hancock Robinson,
the gentleman whose life is snuffed
out in the play. In the Pitt production,
that gentleman will be Oscar Good-
stein. C39.

Whichever of those named for the
cast, excepting the unfortunate vic-
tim, strikes the reader as most villain-
ous might well be the murderer.

“VVho Killed Cock Robin?” is re-
puted to be a genuine thriller. It is
the common play-within-a-play, where
a make-believe murder turns out to be
a real murder, which, after all, is not
a real murder.

The first act is a rehearsal of a
play by the Cope Valley Community
Players, including a thrilling duel
scene.

The second act is the presentation
of the play in the play before an audi-
ence, when the duel scene arrives,
the loser staggers and falls, just as
he is supposed to do. But, so help
us, he is really dead.

How the play ends, of course, and
the technique used in the killing, are
not matters for discussion here.

The staging of “Cock Robin” is ex-
pected to be very difficult. It involves
more changing of scenery than Pitt
Players have ever attempted. It will
be the ﬁrst murder mystery that Play-
ers have ever produced.

Just Like History

Reporter Finds Research In Files
Easiest Way To Cover Dance

For this assignment, the easiest
method could be to take The Pitt
News issue of November 25, Vol.
XXVII, No. 28, put down verbatim
the headline at top of page one, col-
umn four, change a date and the
name of an orchestra leader, and copy
ourselves an accurate story.

In that issue it was announced that
“Keiser Chooses Beverley Brown
Again As Queen,” with incidental re-
marks that the College Association
was sponsoring a formal dance two
nights later. ,

Keiser—Paul R. Keiser, ’36——pres-
ident of the Association, has again
choosen Miss Brown, ’37, for Friday
night’s CA Winter Formal at the
Hotel Schenley ballroom, with tick-
ets at $1 a couple. “Absolutely the
most inexpensive formal in Univer-
sity history,” wrote a reporter on No-
vember 25. His words hold true
again.

The really important——and newest
—-angle of the Winter Formal Friday
is the fact that every cent cleared by
the affair will “aid a worthy cause,”
as they say. The CA loan fund, a
unique campus institution which
specializes in small loans on notice of
24 hours for short term periods, has
rescued more than 50 students over
the past year from momentary ﬁnan-
cial catastrophe, and this fund will
beneﬁt by a successful affair Friday
night:

Scheduled for 9 o’clock, with Jimmy
Bray’s 10 piece orchestra booked,. the
formal follows the CA’s policy of plac-
ing major dances within the reach of
the University’s average——and, hence,
not too prosperous——student.

Copying from issue of November
“Tickets for the formal are avail-
able iii the office of the dean of men,
Room 801, Cathedral, in the office
of the College, Room 205, State Hall,
with Vvilliam Daufenbach in Alumni
Hall, and may also be purchased from
the following members of the cabinet:
Keiser, Miss Brown, William Hughes,
’36, social chairman, Edwin Beachler,
’37, vice president, Doris Evans, ’37,
secretary, Theodore Whitaker, C38,
treasllrer. Lucy Conn, ’38, Gertrude
Schein, '36, Anne June Elmer, '36,
Anthony Lucas, ’37, Al Duff, '36, E11-
nore Humphries, ’36, Ray Scheib, 37,
Martha Fuller. ’38, and Charles B.
Holstein, '36.”

Charter Day Friday Almost
. Arrives At Sesquicentennial

 

Vicissitudes Of University History Being Recorded
For Celebration In 1937; Plans Under Way

Friday is the 149th anniversary of
the founding of the University. While
an important date in the University
calendar, this charter day is rather
a signpost pointing to the sesqui-cen-
tennial anniversary next year, when
a grand celebration will mark 150
years of the University’s history.

On February 28, 1789, two years
before the Constutional Convention
created the United States, the Pitts-
burgh Academy was chartered. The
Academy, a two-story, three-room af-

fair, remained intact until the school
and Pittsburgh had been seized by
‘growing pains. That was in 1819.
The Academy was rechartered as the
Western University of Pennsylvania
with Robert _Bruce as head.

‘Civil war, panics, and ﬁres put the
school on its mettle, and it survived

to become one of the largest institu- ,

tions of the country. After the ﬁres
of the ﬁrst ha.lf of the 19th century,
the University was rebuilt by 1855.

In the early nineties the school
was moved to Allegheny, now known
as the Northside. It is from that
background that we derive our “Al-
leghenee” cheer. The year 1908 is
especia-lly signiﬁcant. It was then
that the University was moved to the
Oakland district and the name
changed from WUP to the University
of Pittsburgh. Dr. Samuel Black Mc-
Cormick was Chancellor at that time.

The attendance tripled in the ten-
year period following the World War.
Yet when Dr. John G. Bowman was
called to the chancellorship in 1921,
the institution was badly in need of
classroom space and seriously in
debt. DI‘. Bowman immediately set

The Uni-
balanced

about to eliminate the debt.
versit-y budget has been
ever since.

With the imperative need for new
buildings, Dr. Bowman saw the an-
swer in a Cathedral of Learning. In
the Cathedral were incorporated the
facilities of a number of buildings.
The Cathedral became the symbol of
education’s ideal, the aspiration of
the city of Pittsburgh.

In 1926 ground was broken_ The
exterior was completed in 1934. Work
has been progressing steadily on the
interior, until at present, it appears
that a large part of the interior will
be completed in time for the sesqui-
centennial anniversary.

-One floor, the 17th, is entirely ﬁn-
ished. Eleven of the 42 ﬂoors are be-
ing occupied or are rapidly nearing
completion. The library on fourth,
ﬁfth, and sixth ﬂoors is expected to
be ready for use near the end of the
semester.

The enrollment at the University
this year has reached 9,500. Of this
number, 1,997? are in the College of
Liberal Arts; 1,183 in the Graduate
School; 2,317 in the Downtown Divi-
sion; 601 in the Schools of Engineer-
ing and mines; 547 in the School of
Business Administration; 561 in the
School of Education; 252 in the School
of Medicine; 194 in the School of
Law; 181 in the School of Pharmacy;
192 in the School of Dentistry; and
15 in the Research Bureau for Retail
Training. The others are in the Ex-

tension Division and the Johnstown

and Erie Pitt Centers.

The faculty numbers 90-0. professors,
instructors, part-time lecturers, and
graduate assistants.

versary, alumni, students, and faculty

Little Known F acts Corner;
Engineers Have An Airplane

 

By Sam Williams

If the poll craze has not faded out.
perhaps a poll on the number of peo-
ple who are aware that the Univer-
sity has an airplane as part of its
equipment would net some lop-sided
results.

However, if this gives you the idea
that you might borrow the plane some
night to visit the girl friend in Cleve-
land, it’s only fair to tell you now that
this one is not the ﬂying kind. That
is, not any more.

The airplane, a loan from the Army
Air Corps to the School of Engineer-
ing, is not used for pleasure jaunts,
flight instruction, or classes in aerial
photography, __but has remained in the
Mines Building for the last several
years developing a bad case of ﬂat
tires, and has enjoyed the pleasure
of wearing its wings for only a short
period each spring when seniors use
it as an airplane rigging laboratory.

Condemned by the Army Air Corps,
this Consolidated PT-1 airplane will
never fly again. Until it was loaned
to the University, it was just so much
snperannuated equipment gathering
dust in an Air Corps hangar. But it
has been put to use here, serving two
purposes. I r  ' - -

‘and carburetor,

The first of these is to show the
methods of construction of airplanes.
Because the training type of plane
has every vulnerable part easily ac-
cessible, a necessity because of the
abuse this type of plane receives, a
student can quickly familiarize him-
self with the important parts of the
airplane, and their location in respect;
to other parts. This is a help to AE
seniors when they reach the "stage
where they design a plane themselves.__

Probably the most important ‘use’
made of the plane is as a dynamo-
meter for experiments on the engine

age is used for than purpose, sinceuit

can safely withstand the swing‘of-the _

propellor. In this fashion ;’valuable

"data are gathered through.exper_iments

with the trainer's 180 horsepower
Hispano-Suiza engine. A _

About the matter of dewinging and
rewinging—when the AE’s study air‘-.
plane rigging in the spring of their
senior year, they assemble the plane
and install all the ﬂying and landing
wires. As the assembled plane takes
up much room, it is necessary that
the wings be moved again when the
rigging. course; has . . been. ‘completed. ~

Smedley D. Butler
Discusses Peace
At Schenley High

Major General Smedley D. Butler
will point out “Which Road to
Peace?” tonight at 8:15 o'clock in the
Schenley High School auditorium.

In an address on “VVar is a Racket"
at Detroit, February 15, Major Gen-
eral Butler gave his audience the
“lowdown” on their Senators.
Fascism, and how drums and ﬁddles
can put one to sleep.

“The only difference between our

big industrial diplomats and the
ward politicians is that the former
carry their handkerchiefs i11 their

sleeves, while the latter wipe their
noses with the back of their hands,”
Butler said. He then launched into a
discussion on how to handle con-
gressmen.

Formerly an officer in the United

I Three-Ring Show

They’re offering a real three-ring athletic show
at the St.adiu1n Pavilion tonight. Pitt ’s wrestling
and boxing teams will go into action against Tem-
ple, and sandwiched between these matches will be
the Panther-Owl basketball game.

Most of the Pitt sports-followers have seen the
cagers in action, but a very few have seen what
the sports-writ.ers call “mitt-wielders” and “mat—
men” in action.

These two sports are making some rapid strides
at the University, under the direction of Boxing
Coach Jack Schricker and VVrestling Coach Eddie
Mazeski. Of course, we haven’t reached the point
where the boxing captain is the campus hero as a.t
VMI, but the teams are progressing.

Collegiate boxers aren’t of the folks who go
around tipping their hats to telegraph poles;
equipment, training, and rules of the sport make
boxing perhaps the most free from injuries of all
college athletics. The undergraduate wrestlers are
as far from the “grunt and groan” professional
school as Trees Gymnasium is from the Cathedral.

Don’t be backward about going up to the Sta-
dium early tomorrow night and staying after the
basketball game to give these two sets of ﬁghters a
little encouragement.

VVe’re just a bit afraid that we won’t be able to
see the brightness of spring when it comes if they
don ’t get to washing those Alumni Hall windows.

What Others Say

Vvords to this effect: “The present seniors, and other
seniors, seem to think that the college will come to an end
when they leave here in June. Their fraternity houses
will never get along without them. The college will
never again be but a shadow of its former self.” La.ugh-
ter. Tears. Pathos. Melodrama. Some joke. Good
joke. Real joke. Hot stuff.

No. The seniors realize perfectly well that this col-
lege and other colleges will keep going without the bene-
ﬁt of their astute minds. The present seniors realize full
well that there will be others who will take their places.

They understand that those who shape the policies of
the college will be able to shape them without the aid of
this group of precocious pups, anxious to show their wis-
dom, so recently acquired here, by attempting to give
some honest advice on questions of college policy.

It might seem then, that attempt to inﬂuence these
policies, attempts made by students who have been here
longer than any other students on this campus, are not
wanted. Some students have inferred that it is only dis-
senting opinion that is not wanted. But even the Su-
preme Court listens to dissenting opinions.

Some students say that it is a select group of their
fellows of whom questions on policy are asked.

But that could not be the case here. In an academic
atmosphere two sides of a question are always discussed.
In intellectual forums, all angles of every question are
weighed before decisions are made. ‘

It must have been a joke. To complete the joke it
would be well for a. group of intellectual Samsons, the
seniors,’ to get together to formulate pla.ns for June, 1936.
Their speciﬁc purpose should be the demolition of the
temple of learning over themselves. Maybe some Phili-s-
tines will do a. pagan dance around the altar.

Local Business Index
Shows Little Change

Industrial Production Maintains Same
Figure As It Had For Last Week

Little change has been recorded by
the Bureau of Business Research in
the index of business for the week
ended February 15th. In fact the hu-
reau reports very little change in the
general index for the last four weeks.

Industrial production was the most
stationary of all with an index of ex-
actly the same as the preceding week.
In this category the slight decrease in
the industrial electric power sales
was oifset by the small gains made in
the iron and steel production and coal
production.

A decline in the volume of business
last week was accounted for by a se-
vere drop in retail sales; on the other
hand, new motor car registrations re-
ﬂected a. pronounced gain.

Originating shipments in the dis-
trict increased slightly, owing chieﬂy
to larger rail shipments of coal. Be-
cause of ice, river shipments in the
district remained almost at a stand-
still. Late in the week, however, one
river was opened for traffic largely
within the city limits.

Dr. Schoen Assails Tradition Mo ralists
In Lecture Before Psychology Forum

Protesting authoritarian moralists,
who, in imposing their “thou shalts”
and "shalt nots” on society, have
tried to force it to their concepts of
morality, says Dr. Max Schoen, head
of the department of psychology at
Carnegie Tech. He gave his psy-
chological interpretation of morality
to the Psychology Forum, Monday
evening.

“The tradition moralists have de-
claimed their laws to be of divine de-
cree, passed down in some mystic
manner to man, and man must there-
fore conform to this mapped-out
moral path, whether it be natural or
good "for the individual to do it or
not,” stated Dr. Schoen, “But moral-
ity is whatever is natural to one’s self
that leads to an integrated, whole-
some, sane society of selves.”

“The moralists control and impose

Baldwin Assails
Foes Of Liberty

“Rea-ctionary Groups Threaten
National Democracy,” He Says

By Robert Saffron

“The New Deal has not curtailed
personal liberties,” said Roger Bald-
win, director of the American Civil
Liberties Union, speaking before the
Community Forum in Schenley High
School Monday. “Because there is
so little to oppress,” he added quick-
ly.

The speaker went on to explain that
the United States did have some of
the elements of the Italian totalitarian
state until “the Supreme Court saved
the liberties of the property class.”
Italy he described as a state in which
public credit and private credit were
so inextricably intertwined that they
were practically “married.” “Of
course they had been living in sin
for a long time, anyhow.”

“Grave Diggers of Democracy,” ti-
tle of Mr. Baldwin’s lecture, are those
forces which attempt to suppress the
liberties of any organization, either
radical or reactionary.

“The American Civil Liberties
Union’s principle is the defense of
all liberties. A few weeks ago our
counsel, Arthur Garﬁeld Hays, ap-
peared in a New York court in behalf
of the fascist Friends of New Ger-
many. Although we hate what that
group stands for, we cannot ignore
any phase of "the ﬁght for personal
freedom and hope to achieve it.”

“University Not- Liberal”

Fascism and communism are not
the only choices before us, according
to Mr. Baldwin. Nor is fascism conﬁn-
ed only to that form in which it arose
in Germany, the quick “putsch” and
seizure of power.
ed every trade unio11 and liberal
group in Ita.ly before he marched on
Rome. And in France another form
is possible, that of a military vet-
eran’s organization, well armed and
compact.

Said the speaker, “Never since the
war have I seen such a united front
of reaction as the United States
Chamber of Commerce, the American
Legion, and Loyal and Benevolent
Order of Elks, and bringing up the
rear, the Daughters of the American
Revolution who are afraid of being
the mothers of another.”

In the question period that follow-
ed, Mr. Baldwin was asked by a stu-
dent of the University: “Can a stu-

dent liberal group achieve success in .

cooperation with the University ad-
ministration?” He replied, “Of course
not. A student organization should be
free from administration if it is to be
at all the expression of student lib-
eral opinion. But then, the question
is academic because Pitt allows no
liberal group of any kind.”

Mussolini destroy- _

rather than direct; therefore they are
immoral. Our Townsends and Cough-
lins, who point out a path to para-
dise, and shake their ﬁsts at those
who differ with them, are themselves
immoral. They are trying to force
their concept of the common good-—
that is, their concept of morality-on
society. They are distorted individ-
uals, who .are not integrated with
their fellow men.”

According to Dr. Schoen, the psy-
chologist has been no better, in that
he has evaded this morality instead
of throwing down the gauntlet to the
tradition moralist as did the biologist.
“The psychologist must deﬁne this
morality and act upon it if society
is to be wholesome and live in peace,”
he said.

Dr. George E. Ellis, professor of
psychology, is chairman of the Forum.

are looking forward to next year’s

Cats Have Dates With Owls
Tonight At Stadium Pavilion

 

Pitt  Temple Cage Teams Battle For Second Place
In Eastern Intercollegiate Conference Race

 

By William K. Trosen
\V'hen a feline gang mixes with a. flock of its feathered enemies,
Owls in t.his case, either fur or feathers are bound to fly. Just which
it will be, Cats or Owls, will be decided tonight in the Stadium when
Pitt’s cage, grappling, and boxing teams tangle with a ‘trio of ath-

letic squads from Temple.

The basketball clash will be one of the most important affairs
of the year at the Panther hangout, for upon the result of tlie even-
ing encounter hinges the second place notch in the Eastern Intercol-

legiate -Conference. _

Temple outﬁt meeting the_ Panther
cagers for the second time T1115 Se8S0h-
In the ﬁrst tilt a few weeks ago the
Panthers had too much on the ball
and hit the spot a bit too often for the
Templites, with the result that the
Owls had their name after the word
“defeat” instead of before it in the
sport headlines the next morning. It
did take a man—sized rally by the
Panthers to come from behind to whip
the Owls, however, and the ﬁnal score
showed the Panthers 48, the OWIS 42.
In the week-end conference games.
this same Temple tribe dished out a
defeat to the present league leaders,
Carnegie Tech, Tech still remains in
the top position despite the defeat, but
the Owls strengthened their D0S1t1011
in the conference. A s.umina1‘Y ﬁllde
Tech leading with six victories out_ot
eight games, Temple right hehmd Wlth
six triumphs and three losses, and the
Panther team next in line with three
won, two lost. _
\Vith two important games C0IIl1hg
up this week, the standing no doubt
will suffer a change, The Panthers
have a ﬁne chance to go into the lead
by cleaning up tonight’s game and Sat-
“may night's game with Tech. If they
can do this, another conference title,
the fourth straight, looms for the
Panthers. _ ,
But counting chickens before——1ts
not the nice thing to do. Usilton has

they have their eyes set on the C011‘

Pitt Tennis Stars
Play For Rovers

 

Maddens, Bald Help Form Rover
Team Entry In Net League

A conglomerate array of tennis
stars known as the Rovers has been
entered in the Pittsburgh Tennis As-
sociations lndoor League which
started Monday evening at Duqiiesne
Garden. It could have easily been
called a Pitt team since three of the
University’s leading net luminaries
are included on the squad roster.

Bob Madden, Joe Madden, and
Ralph Bald together with a couple of
leading district players comprise the
Rover outﬁt. Bob will play the No.
1 position with either Joe or Bald ﬁll-
ing in the No. 2 and 3 posts.

The Rovers’ ﬁrst tilt was scheduled
to be played last evening against
PAA. Next Monday evening they line
up against Belmont.

Both Madden boys have been active
in tennis competition this winter, Bob
making a couple of trips to New York
to play in national events, and Joe
surprising tennis followers with his
brilliant play in the recent PAA in-
vitation tournament.

Inter-team contests will consist of
two singles and two doubles matches,
a ruling prohibiting a singles partici-
pant from competing in the doubles
play.

With three of Pitt’s varsity mem-
bers getting in practice during the
indoor season, Coach Dave O’Lough-
1in’s Panther net team should be in
inid—seasoii form when the tennis sea-
son opens probably early in April.

Natators Prepare
For Army Outﬁt

To Leave Friday For Dual Clash
With Cadets At West Point

 

 

Coach Pat ~Corr’s varsity swimmers
take to the road this week-end, jour-
neying to West Point, New York,
where they will meet Army's water
forces in a dual meet on Saturday
afternoon.

According to reports from the Point,
the cadets are as strong in the water

as they are on land, making the out—‘

look a bit dark for the Pitt splashers.

The team will leave Pittsburgh at
9:55 o'clock Friday evening, and ar-
rive at V.-'es'i Point shortly before
noon on Saturday. After the meet,
the group wi 1 go to New Y rk for the
evening, returning to Pittsburgh on
Sunday morning.

Coach Corr will only take a small
outﬁt on the trip, either seven or eight-
man team. Those who are certain of
making the trip are: Captain Lind-
berg, Locke. Geyei‘. Stiranko, Lavine.
McQuillan, Anderson, Manager Nel-
son, and Coach COl'l'. lf Bob Prince,
sophomore fre.esty1ei', who was absent
from practice last week due to ill-
ness, can get in shape this week, he
will probably be the other natator to
go on the trip,

In Olympic Ticket Contest

Harold Coiiiielly a.iid \Valter Good,

Official totals show that Connolly
led by a slight margin of seven tick-

to Good’s total of 93. However, it
was decided by the committee that
the ﬁrst prize of $5 and the runner-up
S53 award would be divided equally be
tween the two leaders since both
were so far ahead of the third highest
total.

Van Keniien with 33 sales and Mc-

will have stiff competition in the high
jump from Clarence Lewis of Rankin.
Lewis defeated both Pant.hei's in the
Univei'sit_v invitations in January with-
a leap of six feet one and seventh-
eiglitlis inches. Bi;-.-iiiictt, however,
cleared six feet, three inches in the
N-atioiial AAU meet at New York, last
Saturday, and should give Lewis a
ﬁght for the AMA title.

This same Lewis defeated Walt
Good in the broad jump with a mark
of 22.3 feet, and tliercfore is favored
to ring up a double victory. Frosh
Edson Routch hung up a mark of 22
feet, four and one-half inches for a
new frosh record in The News Olym-
pic beneﬁt two weeks ago to serve
notice on his senior competitors.

Officials in charge hope that the
“feature” duel between the two rec-

ord—holders, Charles Groat and Harold
Connelly, will be successful in Satur-
day’s half mile event.

to VVasl1ington, D. C. to argue with
debaters of Trinity College and then

the affirmative side of the Supreme
Court question.

There wi.l also be an extension de-
bate before the Shrine Lunch Club

liam Penn Hotel. Jeannette Swartz,
C38; and Marceila Leyton, C37, will

Chorus, WAA Girls
Prepare Joint Ballet

This afternoon at the Physical
Education Annex coeds will try out
for places in the VVAA ballet given
in conjunction with the VVoman"s
Choral home concert in May. Tryouts
will begin at 2:30 o’clock.

This is the first time that anytliin.-‘I
of this sort has been attempted on
campus. The choral is to sing
Tschaikowslty’s “S‘eeping Beauty”
which has been transcribed for wo-
men’s voices by Bornschein, while
selected dancers perform. Miss Eliza-
beth Rearick, assistant director or
physical education, will direct the
dancing as well as looking after the
costumes and scenery.

Mrs. Robert Ayars. director of the
‘Womans Choral,  already rehears-
ing her group for its part of the work.
Marion Vv'erner, is to do the solo
work.

‘Save Your Soles,’
Say Junior Coeds,
‘For Rummage’

So you threw that old shoe at your
brother's bride, did you? VVhere's
your school spirit? Don’t you know
the junior women are having a rum-
mage sale‘?

‘What if it was size 18 footgear——
didn’t you read in The Pitt News
that “any bulky objects” wou‘d be
called for‘?

I’ll bet my yesterday morning's
doughnut hole against your Aunt
Gussie’s pulse-warynners that if you

had handed that downtrodden sole
over to the proper authorities (rum-
mage committee to you) you’d have
taken a step in the right
and also tramped your way right into
the hearts of the Junior women, to
boot

And that dilapidated lamp shade
you hung around the neck of Mrs.
l<lo*z’s felinus domesticus in token of
the esteem you felt for her nocturnal
serenade—aren’t you sorry you didn’t

bring it to Heinz House? VVell, you
ought to be.
Since we’re headed for topical

thoughts you might do well to take
a trip up to the attic right now to
seek some special something to sac-
riﬁce for salesgirls to show and sell.
Be sure to see Grace Quil, C, before
Saturday's sale.

Senior Court Distributes
Nominating Lists Today

Approved lists of all the nomin-
ating committees of women’s or-
ganizations may be obtained from
the office of Miss Helen P. Rush
at Heinz House, today. The lists,
which were left in her office Mon-
day, have been approved and
checked for eligibility, scholar-
ship, and activity points by Senior
Court.

Friday all committees will gath-
er at fl-Ieinz House at 12:30 o’clock
for their ﬁrst meeting. Members
of the Court will address the
group, telling them of the qualiﬁ-
cations to be watched for in the
character and ability of the nom-
inee.

Instructions for the rest of the
nominating procedure to be follow-
ed by the committees will be
given to them Friday. Sylvia
Fixel, C36. chief justice of Senior
Court, will preside at the meet-
mg.

Sleep, Suspense,
Studies Overialte
Rushers, Rusiiees

Fraternity women, as well as
rushees, are catching up on their
overdue themes, belated axioms, and

historical outlines. After an exten-
sive three-day rushing period, rushers
and rushees are settling down to the
general run of affairs.

Bid lists are in Miss Helen P.
Rush’s office and ballots have been
mailed to those women who have re-
ceived bids by at least one fraternity.
Ballots should be marked and return-
ed to Heinz House by 9:30 o’clock Fri-

day morning. "
At 7 o’clock Friday evening, the
suspense which has been hanging

over the sorores will be over. Then
fraternities may call for their accept-

: ance lists at the University Club. Suc-

cessful fraternity women will send
messages of congratulations to new
pledges by noon Saturday, which
marks the end of silence week.

Ribbon services will be held before
3:30 o’clock Monday morning. At
these ceremonies, pledge ribbons will
be pinned on the new pledges.

Dixon To Speak

Russell A. Dixon, instructor in eco-
nomics, will address the Engineers’
Club on “T-Vhy the Consumer Gets
Cheated,” tomorrow, at 12:30 o’clock
in Room 801, Cathedral. The address

will be the third of a series of talks
whicli started February 13th and will
last until April 16th.

Out Nevada way the boys are busy
enrolling in a new college devoted to
the studies of ranching and cow-punch-
ing, New York debutantes are staying
up nights doing laboratory work and
experiments for their Charm School
classes. Even the most conservative
of universities are expanding their
curriculum to include courses on mar-
riage, raising a family, feeding live
stock, square dancing, and glass blow-
ing.

There is still a deﬁnite need, how-
ever, for a college that will conform
itself to a straight B. A_ course. Bach-
elor in Activities. The faculty will
consist of men experienced and know-
ing in the art of personality and origin-
ality: old actors, fraternity presidents,
home-coming week chairmen, inter-
viewers for movie magazines, radio an-
nouncers, club hostesses, ace sales-
men, and retired masters of cere-
1 monies.

l The requirements for entrance will

be rigid and rigorous. Applicants
must have previously shown a tenden-
cy in prep school toward cutting class-
es to write stories for the newspaper,
ignoring home-work assignments to re-
hearse in the class play, and a record
of being known to at least one-third
of the student body.

The new student should be able to
wise-crack with the janitor and the
dean of men, wear a plaid necktie
without a blush of self-consciousness,
and have a chest strong enough to
stand under the pressure of pearl-stud-
cled gold pins and bronze keys.

Unhampered by the usual monotony
of classes, text-books and study, days
and nights of the term will be devoted
to serious study of those subjects
which universities now term “extra-
curricular.” Stiff courses will be
given in student newspaper work: the
technique of plugging one interest in
stories, running typewriters with gum-
band springs and slit ribbons, padding
news, and improving on quotations. In-
cidental training in the‘ class will in-

clude exams on the coatless attitude
at the typewriter, comfortable poses
on office desks, and answering tele-
phone calls with one hand, against a
background of machines and conversa-
tion.

The most popular courses will prob-
ably turn out to be those in dance
chairman techniques, including gbtting
the appointment, effective publicity,
Grand Marching, diplomatic choosing
of committee members, favor select-
ing, and choice press agent vocabu-
lary regarding dance orchestras, and
those in Campus Politics, or the Art
of Seeming Important,

for Meeting the Social Situation, Fra-
ternity Formulaes, and Building Up
the Athlete, with graduate courses on
All-Americanism.

The ﬁrst two years will be devoted
to general personality and reputation
build—up, with electives in dramatics,
writing, tap-dancing, banquet speech-
es, repartee, correct grooming, singing,
including solo work, leading the prom
orchestra, and harmonizing, hand-
shaking. and bridge. Specialization
comes in the last year, with the stu-
dent majoring in some outstanding ac-
tivity and getting himself successfully
established as head of that organiza-
tion as the ﬁnal examination.

Graduation will be the climax to an
eventful four years. and will be in the
form of a mammoth stage show, with
the chancellor as master of ceremon-
ies. Each student will accept his di-
ploma, folded into a leather favor,
with a neat buck and wing, and a wit-
ticism or song. Autographed pictures
of the favorite members of the class
and the entire chorus will be distrib-
uted at intermission.

After graduation, what? The
alumnus of the activities college won't
have that worry. He can enter any
ordinary university, conﬁdent that
half ‘his education is completed, and
settle down to four years of restful
study.

Dr. Clausen To Address
College Orientation Class

members of the women’s college

lege orientation classes.
