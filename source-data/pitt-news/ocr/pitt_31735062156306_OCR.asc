for security of this family which
is -thought to be worldly and so-_
phisticated by the small town
boy. -

student member should be select-
ed by the chancellor or the ath-

he held, is.not in a good position
to recognize the man who under-
stands the problems of the stu-
dents and the athletes.

Vincent W. Lanfear, dean of
the School of Business Adminis-'

tration and chairman of the Ath-
letic Committee said Wednesday
he felt “Student Congress should
be able to pick capable men at the
beginning of the year and permit
them to last out their terms.” He

felt that “the Athletic Committee

"should not become involved in
student politics.”

Takes Time

Dean Lanfear notedthat the
committee must deal with prob-
lems and issues that last through-
out the year. It takes some time,

he pointed out, “before a student .

can learn to do an effective job.‘
For that reason he should be ex-
pected to serve for a year.”

The chagrin and evident frustrationof Student Con-

_ gress-members" at their inability to oust Don Milletary from

his post on the Athletic Committee has its humorous aspects.
What the lawmakers need is a staff of legal experts to read

.. and interpret the ruies under which SC operates, and thus
, help them steer clear of traps like this.

The situation also points up a serious disagreement in
aims between the administration and student government
that, if carried tovits logical limit, could cause no end of

 ill feeling. If studentgovernment is ever going-‘ to be ef-
fective here, it wlil have to‘ operate under consistent, log1- -
' cal rules, with powers clearly deﬁned. There is no consis-

 __tency- or logic ‘in’ the rule that says SC can place a" man

.

in a”job but not remove him from it. « - - g
- The next question is’: why did the Board of Trustees

1 set up such a screwball arrangement? Inescapably, it lo.oks

as though the Trustees hit upon Student Congress "as a,
convenient channel through which a student representa-

. tive could be-seated on the Athletic Committee. And since

‘Student Congress authority ends once its choice is made,
it further appears that the Trustees were not _motivated
by any democratic ideals in setting up the plan, but rather
were just making things‘ easy for themselves. In other
words, the attitude of the administration in this case seems
to be that student government ‘is a tool, tobe used by the
administration _at its convenience. Which can only lead
to intense student resentment.

We’re not saying this was in the minds of /the Trus-

tees when they made the rule; there are_other reasons that
can and’ have been put forward forestablishing it. But
‘nevertheless, since the rule is in effect, it tends ‘to push’
student-administration relationsin the direction indicated
above. For the sake of bettering those relations, the dis—
crepancy in the rules ought to be corrected.  ‘

Program 'Co—ordin_ator,
Religion-in-Life Week:

We have ﬁnally reached that
point in man’s history, when we
are able to do an effective job
of controlling and inﬂuencing
our environment. Tremendous
progress has been made with

wants.-

But in this bright picture, we
still have one basic and major
problem. Man has’ not learned

' -how to get along with, other men_

‘I can think of three‘ different,
but related, areas in which
brotherhood among .‘men should
be a reality. _ '

The ﬁrst, and in mylopinion,
the most important area is
brotherhood among nations and

-peoples throughout‘ the world.

There ‘was a- time in history
when we ‘could ﬁght each other
continually without- seriously
harmful effects. But, today, in

College Roundup . . .

If You Think.You've Cot iTroubles..-.~

By Tim Kovor '

From the many exchange papers of colleges

the age of the atomic bomb and
in the appearance of two ‘tre-
mendous powers in the world,
we have a situation which is

completely different from any

that man has ever faced in his
history. Today world brother-
hood cannot only be a dream or
a reality, it is an. absolute ne-
cessity. ‘ 9

» Still a Dream

-But, unfortunately, i the only
possible conclusion that we can
state about brotherhood’ among

nations is that it is only a dream.’

Today,.'there has been an al-

most complete breakdown in ne-‘

gotiations and diplomacy in the‘

world. This has resulted large-
ly because we‘have not realized
the necessity of getting along
with other peoples, of lmaking
comprises, or in a word, of
having brotherhood. 
" We have to do more than
dream aboutiworld brotherhood.
If man is going .to have a‘ future,
we’d have to turn this particular
dream into reality_ . ~. _
The second kind of brother’-
'hood‘invo,lves people who -belong
to different racial and religious
groups.. This is the type of

brotherhood that we‘most.oft_en_

hear about. Very often, we for-
get that this is one of the basic
short-comings of the - United
States. While we talk about

E

13

democracy, we permit serious

cases of discrimination to exist
within our own country.

No Reality ‘Yet

But we can be somewhat‘sat-

_ isﬁed in realizing that progress is

beoing made. We now have many
state and city‘FEPC laws, educa-
tional organizations have been
helping, and a large number of

liberal Supreme Court decisions '
have been made and enforced ..

throughout the country. But,
even though we are not. now
merely dreaming about progress,
we still have not yet reached this
point in the United States when

we can saythat brotherhood ii"

a reality.

The third type of brotherhood.
involves the individual person

and his relations with other in-
dividuals. This is the everyday
contacts‘ that we have with out

acquaintances and friends. The '
Golden Rule says that we should 
do unto others as we would have —

others do unto us. To‘ the ex-
tent thatwe do not follow this
simplerule, brotherhood can be
only a dream. ' ..
We haven’t quite realized tha

brotherhood "today is a necessity
if "we expect to survive and fol-
low democratic principles. It
can be a reality, but it is still
more than a dream.

Carl Olson’s surprising four-man mile re-

trackmen into the Michigan State Relays tomorrow
- against aﬁeld of top collegiates from the Mid-

» Currently, the quartet of Joe Dudas, Ray ,
Lee, Chuck Fritz, and Bruce Giron have upset -

many of the better» teams in

winter by breaking the tape ﬁrst in the Wash-

games. Their victims in two sweeps have in-
cluded highly-regarded Colgate, Villanova,

LaSalle, and Georgetown,

Besides the mile relay team Coach Olson will
enter a shuttle high hurdle relay team of Wally
Monohan, Pitt record holder, Chris King, Don Ken-

- nedy, and Bill Donnelly. Don Minihan will repre-
sent the Blue—and-Gold in the pole vault.

Olson admits that he didn’t expect his four
spirited thinclads to fare as well as they have.
“No, I didn’t think that the boys would show
so well,” the veteran track authority boasted,
“but this bunch of mine is the most spirited
and enthusiastic gang I’ve ever seen.”

He restrained his opinion on the outcome of
the .mile relay, cautioning that Oklahoma A&M,
Sugar Bowl champs, Ohio State, Notre Dame, and
Michigan are equally adept on the cinders. -

Coach Ben Grady’s tankers, who

strong Navy squad tomorrow, still
have hopes ‘of repeating as East-

Despite the fact that Pitt has
dropped decisions to Ohio State,
North Carolina State, and Syra-
cuse, the results are not indicative
of its chances to win the ECSA
title again since all three teams
are rated among the best in the
nation.

“A lot will depend on the other
team’s strength,’.’ Grady said, “but

Although beaten, 76-70, at Columbus early in the sea-

the'Bucks on its home court against a slightly shorter team.

The Panthers consider him the best center they’ve faced this

So’ far Buckeye Coach ‘Floyd

An Era of Good I
Feng BY BORIS VVEINSTEIN

Sports" Editor
There has been an Era of. Good Feeling harboring around
Pitt basketball for many years—since Pitt and Duquesne
ceased to be rivals in the sport. Since the renaissance of bas-
ketball here, however, tranquility has been threatened.

Students and fans now clamor for a revival-_of the long-
dead series. But do they stop to think what the, outcome
of such a series would mean? I doubt it.

Most of them don’t remember the blood that slopméd around
when the two teams met. It ,wasn’t players’ blood always.
"Often times the grandstanders couldn’t resist the temptation.

Prof. Robert X. Graham, .head of the journalism department
until his death last week, opposed the revivalvehemently. Mr.
Graham vividly recalled the series’ battles but made even astronger
issue of another point.

“Why play a team that you know will beat you most of the
time,” he reasoned. “It’s not fun to play year after year and just
hope for an upset.” , ,

Let’s proceed along Mr. Graha.m’s lines. This year could
be classiﬁed as the “upset year.” Pitt has reached its post-war
peak andmight have given the weak 1952-'53 Duquesne team a
ﬁght-—if they were to ‘play. But, what about the other years
when the Dukes ranked with the ‘top teams in the nation?

And what about the future? Looking at Pitt’s bench strength
one holds a dim forecast for Dr. H_ C. Carlson and Field House fans.
The game would be a proﬁtable one but certainly_not the product
of good matchmaking. .

Possibly the clamor will quiet down like other grandstand brain-

Mitt Workouts Soon

Coach Ralph Mitterling an-
nounced Wednesday that the var-
sity squad will probably begin
spring training in two weeks.
Workouts will be held at the Sta-
dium practice ﬁeld.

In tomorroW’s match, however,
the Panthers face a team closer
their own class and though Grady
doesn’t expect to do as well as last
year when the teams ended in a
42-42 deadlock, the match should
give some indication of Pitt’s po-
tential.

nese will be preparing for their
New Year’s celebration. Although
the two holidays rarely meet on
the same day onthe calendar, the
New Year falls not earlier than

Three-day Affair

The ‘most important festival on
the Chinese calendar lasts three
or four days. For many, how-
ever the perked is regarded as
ending on the ﬁfteenth day of the
first month with the well-known
1?,‘east;of Lanterns The New Year
has been the time for the settle-
ment of debts, and it has.been
considered bad form to enter it
without having paid them. The
day itself and the several follow-
ing ones are devoted to feasting .
iandivisiting, and all but the most
necessary labor ceases. Honors
are paid to ancestors and there
are family reunions.

While birthdays are observed,
according to Chinese reckoning a
c_hild~is one year old at its birth
and two years of age after ‘it
passed into its ﬁrst New Year.
Thus, an- infant born. in the last
"month of the year is in the suc-
ceeding month said to be two _
- years old. All these traditions of
2- feasting and good times will be
 , observed in the large Chinese com-

munities in this country as well

-as China ‘itself. ‘

‘Tea To Be Held
Joan I-Iirsh, Quo Vadis member‘
who workswith the Chinese Com-
mittee, says that the Chinese

Room in A‘ the Cathedral will be

decorated for the occasion and

that a special tea is being plan-

ned for Monday, Feb. 19, from
V 3 to 4 in the Commons, Room.
‘Chinese tea, cookies, and candy
will be served.
