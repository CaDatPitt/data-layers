The Asenjo report and suggested '

The report, initially introduced at
the June 4 FASC meeting, included
proposals by the FAS ad hoc

‘Chaired by Dean Jerome L.
Rosenberg of FAS. the Council
most heavily debated the proposed
amendment which stated: To be

After 2 Year /vlisunderstonding

BY SCOTT MACLEOD

Chancellor .Wesley Posvair has
settled a two year misunder-
standing with the United Farm-
workers (UFW). .

lssuing a statement, Posvar said,
“It. is hoped that the whole issue
may be rendered obsolete by a
favorable. resolution of the dispute
between the United Farmworkers
and competing interests." “

The action clarifies another
statement issued by the Chancellor

October 18, 1973 whichdid not
include boycotting grapes. The
University's new policy is to

boycott grapes and lettuce "pro-
duced by interests competing with
the United Farmworkers."

A technical matter. that of the
“type of dispute" the United
Farmworkcrs are involved in
nationally. was not changed in the
new statement. It refers to the
UFW troubles as a “jurisdictional
dispute"

but UFWSC members ”

contest it is-not.

Posvar’s statement, given to the
United ’Farmworker’s Support
Committee, says “through petition
and vote of the Student Govern-
ment and University Senate (the
Pitt students and faculty) have
demonstrated impressively their
sympathy for the efforts of the
United Farmworkers.“

According to the agreement.

It was stated thelcommltment to
the boycott stan/dxs unless there are

significantly altered circumstances
and/ or a major change in student
faculty consensus causing them to
change their minds.

‘‘I think the statement speakstfor
itself," said Dr. Raymond Coble,
executive assistant to the Chan-
cellor." It works out for everyone’s
satisfaction. We are indeed happy
about it.”

Coble said the whole problem
was just a series of misunder-
standings from the beginning.

“We hope this works out for
everyone‘s advantage in the
interest of social_justice. -That is a
sincerely felt wish," he added.

Grace Cisneros, coordinator of
the UFW Pittsburgh boycott, said,
“We’re really glad the grapes were
included in this .statement. I hope
that the school will continue to
support the UFW for the duration
of the boycott.

“This time of year, you know,
Thanksgiving, 1 hope the people
remember the farmworkers be-
cause they’ll be buying a lot of

food. I just hope they don’t buy
non-UFW grapes or lettuce.”

_ Asenjo Proposal

Sent to Committee 

(Confiiiuerl from Page 1)
wording and part of the proposed
amendment, was passed as an
amendment to the Asenjo state-
ment.

The second Asenjo proposal which
the Council discussed stated:
Faculty members shall be consul-
ted on all major academic issues
involving the department, such as
appointments, curriculm, program
requirements... etc.

A Humanities Council proposal
was then introduced which would
amend the Asenjo proposal. The
change added the word “promo-
to the list of academic
issues. The Asenjo proposal was
then accepted and passed.

Another amendment to the
paragraph on consultation, which
would include the suggestions and
participation of graduate students
and undergraduate‘ as well as
faculty members, was introduced.
Discussion followed, but a decision
was not reached.

Some Council members felt the
proposal would be impractical due
to the large numbers of students
involved and because of the
possible legal problems in matters
of tenure and departmental promo-
tions. ~

A spokeman for student interests,
however, said student opinions and
suggestions are especially impor-
tant in faculty appointments and
promotions. The rationale is
students can best judge indivi-
duals’ rapport and personal quali-
ties considered important in
reviewing an individual’s qualiﬁ-
cations.

The proposal for student interests
was not passed, but will be further
discussed at .the next meeting.

But to help alleviate this problem
a tenant, unless ‘restricted by his
lease, has the option of subletting
his apartment. _

When subletting, a tenant rents
his apartment to another party
while "usually retaining the initial
lease on the apartment. The rent is
still paid to the orealtor “ by the
tenants, and all agreements made
by the first set of tenants hold for
the subletters.

It is possible for a new lease to be
written up between the landlord
and the tenant. This would

necessitate terminating the lease of ’

the original tenant.

If a new lease is written up, the

security deposit from the initial
tenants is returned within the legal
30 days, and a new security deposit
is collected by the landlord from
the. subletters.

If he is unable to find someone to
sublet his apartment, the first

tenant is responsible for paying the-

rent of the remaining months of the
lease. Some realtors provide the
"service of finding subletters for
their tenants for a small fee.
Whatever the case, finding a
subletter can accomodate termina-
ting a lease early, but can’ also
cause additional responsibilities. If
-a lease isn’t changed, the initial

his head and sighed.

of his eyes. He looked at me and
walked over to the desk. ,
“Hey, how’re you doing," he
said as he sat down. “I haven't
seen you here before.”
“Well, I wasn't in last week-
end.” . .
“Neither was I. I don’t do this
too often. I wasn’t gonna get up
this morning but the money’s good.
It’s reallylfunny ‘cause. I’m not
even a lab tech. My brother got me
this job. I help him out sometimes
over at Montefiore.” He continued
talking as he wrapped a constric-
tion band around a man’s arm.
“One time I had to take blood
from this fat lady. Man, she was so
big. They had.this lady on two
beds. No lie. I got really

He took the needle out of the man’s V

woman. The curly-haired ’ man
looked up. ‘\
“Hey, I think I know that lady.

young lab tech called out another
name. A woman who was working
the middle chair yawned and
rubbed her hand against her
forehead. She gathered her energy
and adjusted her dress as a man sat
down in the chair. Using all the
strength she could muster, she
pulled the constriction band around
the man’s arm. The curly-haired
man went over to her and put his
hand on her shoulder.

“You should've been here last

weekend. We were testing
Librium. Everybody was really
zonked out." The woman laughed

and slapped a cotton ball on the
man's arm.

The last of the three men left the
room. The curly-haired lab tech
looked at a schedule on the wall.
“O.K...ﬁve minutes till the next
one,” he said. The young lab tech
sat down at the desk chair. ‘He
leaned back in the chair and rubbed
his eyes.

“I’d like to be makin’ this kind of

leaned back and lit it. Suddenly his
face "lit up.

“Oh, I forgot," he motioned
towards the pack of cigarettes,
“may I?"

The curly-haired man walked
over to the doorway and called out
a- name. My friend put out the
cigarette and winked.

“I need some coffee, let's go." I

“I think I'll go back in and see '

shrugged his shoulders.

“It’s a drag.” I left the room
and returned to the office. I passed
through the waiting room jungle of
bodies and entered the laboratory.
I sat_ down in my chair. The
westerner was sitting in the chair
directly in front of me. After his
lab tech was finished taking blood
he sat down at the desk. He
propped his feet up on the desk and
dabbed at his arm with a cotton
ball. A

“What’ve you got in that

“Nothing really in this thing,
anyway. It’s just some notes on
patients I’ve worked with,” I said.

“Oh, you gotta protect their
confidence, huh?”

“Yeah, something like that.”

The curly-haired tech began
collecting the ﬁlleditubes. He
placed them in the mixing machine
and flicked a switch. The machine
hummed.

“Well, that's it for today.”

grabbed a clipboard and left. I got
up and looked in the waiting room.
Magazines were scattered- about.
A deck of cards had spilled onto the
floor. They were spread out in a
fan. Cotton balls were-everywhere.
They cluttered ashtrays, dotted
tables, and were ' elven stuffed
between couch cushions.

“Hey, anybody want to get
stuck?" said my friend. He looked
around.

“Where'd everybody go?" He

I unbuttoned the lab coat and

Pittsburgh Country Dance Societys

An Ancient Grace Alive and Well

BY JOHN SMITH
ARTS EDITOR

The dance, at one time, was one
of the most delightful forms of
social intercourse. In recent years,
however, this form has degene-
rated into a form of social
masturbation, with partners (whe-
ther known or unknown) being
nearby so as both can avoid looking
too stupid. (You must admit that
you would look pretty ridiculous all
alone out there, shuffling your feet
vaguely in time to some obnoxious
music.)

It's‘ not that I- am against wild,
frenzied dancing, although I do
ﬁnd it difficult to work myself into a
frenzy over Jethro Tull or Elton
John. But an Elton John frenzy
certainly does better than your
typical college “party" of today.-
These are the ones where everyone
sits around under black lights,
sipping ﬂat Boone's Farm, and the
music is invariably the latest Zeps

album, always too loud to talk over ‘

and too moronic to listen to.

It’s a real pity that group and
social dancing ﬁzzeled out the way
it did in the early sixties. Doing
dances that require deﬁnite steps
and patterns can "give great
satisfaction to the couple or group
involved. It’s a great excuse (do we
need excuses nowadays?) to get ’
close to a person or persons you "

like. While those who are doing

When I stepped out of the

at the door of room 524. They
chatted and laughed about the

out, and the rest of the group’

 “The Optimist"-—A family  

Movie Minus the Slop

BY M.C. PILECKI I
Once upon a time, most films
were so heavily censored (for sex)
that any flick was considered
palatable family fare. And there
were some good 'ones back in the

“good old days,” like the Marx‘

Brothers.

With the coming of a new
“sophisticated" cinema. parents
and moralists decided it wasn't for
So the “family movie" was
born. Most of these have been
poorly’made. unrealistic glops of
sugary goo ...that insulted the

‘ intelligence of both the kids and
their parents. The influence of the A

television sitcom made most of the
G and PG ﬁlms tastelessmiddle

intelligent audience. . ..

Fortunately, there have been a

kids without fear of rotting their
minds. '

The Optimists takes place in
London. south of the river. in a
“lower class neighborhood" (more
appropriately. a slum). The
situation is somewhat believable.
Two kids. Liz and Mark. feel
rejected by a working mother with
yet another baby and a father
working overtime to afford a new
flat in a better slum.

Now, it does sound silly to talk
about a movie concerning two kids

and a dog, but this one is better \
The photography is

better than in many “adults" films,
and one shot of the setting sun
shining through the factory smoke
is quite striking. The scenes of the
kids’ neighborhood, with the
cracked buildings‘, railroad tracks
and ubiquitous garbage, is tellingly
contrasted to theshining modern
apartments just across the river.

A capacity crowd of 56.500 will be
on hand Saturday as the Panthers
play host to the Fighting Irish of
Notre Dame. It will be the first
sellout since two years, when the
Irish last visited Pitt. ,

"I don't mean to take anything
away from our other opponents.

but this game is going to be a lot

tougher than the most recent
ones," said Pitt head coach Johnny
Majors at the weely football
luncheon.

Majors said that he doesn't watch

Ara Parseghian's Fighting Irish of Notre Dame invade Pitt Stadium
this Saturday afternoon in what shapes up to be an exciting ballgame.
The 56,500 seats on Cardiac Hill have all been sold and, for the first
time in ten years, the game will be important to both-teams. In fact, it
willjbe the Panthers’ most important game since‘ the 1963 Penn State
tussle. won ’by the Cats 22-21. . ‘ ' . ' -
- The stage for this _‘game began materializing last January, when
Casimir Myslinki hired the Johnny Majors Re-Construction Company
to pump new life into The S'amerOld Panthersf; ‘- ~ '

And boy. what a stage it is. The Irish come to town as the nation's
fifth ranked team, sporting some impregnable offensive and defensive

I‘ statistics. The Irish have allowed only 58 rushing yards a game to their

opponents so far. They have given less than a touchdown (5.9 points)
defensively and only 163.6 total offense. This,- while_accumulatin’g a 33
point average for themselves. No" wonder they have won seven in a
row. . '

Pitt...what else can be said of the job Majors has done.

But to understand the BIGNESS of the ballgame, a little background

«is necessary. ' \ I ‘

Since 1963. when Johnny Michelosenfs team was’ 9-1 and ranked’ _

third in the nation, the Pitt athletic program has beenriding a speedy

toboggan down an unending ski slope. The report card shows a failing »

22-68-2 mark. - A — '

It was an unnerving turn of eve‘nts_."then, which began the.Pitt
downfall. Having lost only to Roger Staubach’s Navy.team 24-12,j_the
jPittster—s were expecting a Bowl bid at any moment. They had only

Penn State standing in front of them. Things were looking bright,‘

beforeidisaster struck. ~ . 
.On the eve of the game, President John F. Kennedy was shot in
Dallas. 'The college football world was in turmoil. At 8:3_0‘that
evening, with Penn State in town, the game was moved back a week.
The-. Bowl committees, however, were anxious to get their bids out._
They'didn’t want to pick Pitt before that crucial game, because,"if Pitt
lost, they,would have the same record as the Nittany Lions. Going into
‘the game, all the bids were out except one--the Cotton Bowl.
If the Cats beat the Lions and if the Army beat Navy. the Panthers
would be heading South. It was not to be. - I e I . _
Fullback Rick Leeseii took a shortlsnap on a fake punt all the way‘ to
the Penn State seven in the closing minutes of the game and Fred
Mazurek ran it in from there to register the Pitt win. But as this was
happening,'Army had the ball on the Navy two yard line as the last six
seconds of the game ticked away: I
At this precise'moment the bite left the Pitt Panther, to the present
day. In 1970. Carl DePasqua's first team made avaliant attempt to

~ break the long standingjinx. They were 5-1 and-top ranked in the East,

when they were blown -out of ancient Archabald Stadium by»Syracuse)
43-l3. They went" on to lose their remaining games. « t
.“This is probablylithe most. important game we’ve played in -some
time."_ Myslinski said at the weekly football luncheon yesterday."
“So much ihinges onjit. Ifwe play well we’ll keep our ranking‘--Pitt was
ranked 20th on the AP weekly wire--and people will be looking atjus
now. It represents more than a winning season for us, I think we'll. get
that at Army, but if we play well. we'll keep our ranking for next year.”
If the seemingly miraculous upset is to takeplace against the Irish,
Majors will be the engineer. ' Seriously, Pitt could not have abetter
man at the helm. This Saturday will also mark the 1st anniversary of
Majors last shocker--a 23-23 tie against Nebraska.
In fact, at-Iowa State Majors was good for at least one upset a year.
In ‘7O and ‘7l he beat two, top ranking Missouri teams in a row.
As Majors has said, “They weren't gettinga virgin, when they» hired
He means he’s been there before.
“I don't believe in being overawed by an opponent.” Majors is‘
saying about the game.‘ “We're‘going out there to play with reckless
abandon and have some fun.- There's no sense for us to be tight about
it."

' In 1963. Tony Dorsett was a nine year old squirt_; Johnny Majors was
just beginning his coaching career at Arkansas; Myslinski was is Saudi
Arabia on a military stint; and Pitt Publicist Dean Billick was in Pitt
Stadium as a Penn State senior. _rooting for his .team to beat Pitt‘, Wow.
it certainly has been a long time since a Panther winning year.

"I don't think it will take a miracleito beat Notre Dame," Majors
said. « V  - ‘ " '

Thursday night, the Pitt Piranha’s
-will face rival Slippery Rock in
Pitt’s only home meet of this fall.
Coach Grindle, a Slippery Rock
alumnus, is optimistic about this
meet, after Saturday’s close match

with Ashland.

“Slippery Rock is going to have to
swim hard -to win this meet. Our
girls looked good at Ashland and
performed well in their first meet of
the season. We should be looser
going into this meet, and, hopefully
we’ll have the backing of a good
home crowd.

“In past years, more parents and
friends of Slippery Rock have come
to our meet than from Pitt. This
year, however, we have more
swimmers from‘ this area and
should gain the edge.” ’

The team ’would appreicate
student support for their first home
meet of the season. The meet is at
7 p.m., Trees Hall Pool.

Anyone interested in joining the
Pitt Aquettes,. Pitt’s synchronized
swimming club, should contact
Mrs. Grindle immediately at
624-4397. The club practices
Monday from 11:30 a.m. to 1:30
p.m. and Thursday from 6-8 p.m.
(This is the fall practice schedule.)
