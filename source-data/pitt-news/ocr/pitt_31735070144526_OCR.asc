Not guilty A

‘plea made

for alleged
bomb threats

by Lauren Buches
Staﬂ Wrdef _
Former Pitt student Louisa Ewuresi

Nkrumah pleaded not guilty to three charg—.

es of making bomb threats to University
of Pittsburgh property at her arraignment
hearing yesterday morning at the U.S. Dis-
trict Court in Downtown Pittsburgh.

The indictment states that Nkrumah is
charged with “use of a telephone to will-
fully threaten that real or personal property
would be unlawfully damaged or destroyed
by means of an explosive,” speciﬁcally the
Cathedral of Learning and Posvar Hall on
April 9 and April 11, 2008, respectively.

Nkrumah spoke only‘ once during the

brief hearing to conﬁrm that she" under-

stood her bail conditions. Her attorney,
Cynthia Reed Eddy, entered the plea on her
behalf as she sat motionless next to Eddy.
Her parents sat tensely in the audience be-
hind her.

Eddy said that Nkrurnah had read and
understood the indictment and declined to
have her_ charges read again at the hearing.

_ An unsecured bond of $10,000 was set
to ensure that Nkrumah shows up for fu-
ture court dates. Because the bond is un-
secured, she does not have to _pay anything
unless she does not appear for court dates.

Presiding Judge Lisa P. Lenihan ex-
plained the terms of the bond to Nkru-
mah. A

The judge said that the defendant can
only travel in the middle and western por-
tions of the state of Pennsylvania, specifi-
cally so she can leave herhome in Harris-

burg to make court appearances at the U.S. in

District Court ir1 Pittsburgh.

Lenihan also told Nkrumah that she has
to avoid all contact with any witnesses or
potential witnesses in the case. 0

According to the indictment memoran-
dum on the case, if found guilty Nkrumah

To the Editor,

The headline of the story on Wednesday Feb. 4, 2009, “Pitt crashes the party,” reprehensibly
condones the violence and destruction of property that broke out in Oakland following the Steel-
ers’ Super Bowl victory on Sunday.

Moreover, it directly and distastefully undermines Chancellor Nordenberg, the other members
of the University administration and, as Nordenberg pointed out in his statement on the rioting, the
value of the University as a whole as outlined in the Pitt Promise

The Pitt News, though student-run and admirably so, allied itself too ﬁrmly with the destruc-
tive and malfeasant sections of the student body that broke both the law and University property
Sunday night;

By choosing such language as “crashes the party,” The Pitt News powerfully implied that the
University administration is  the legal proceedings surrounding the riots too seriously and
that the “party” had been a good  that ought to be celebrated rather than punished.

I found myself in the midst of the throng Sunday night, celebrating along with the rest of Oak-
land. But such jubilance does not beget violence _ '

Instead, students chose to destroy traffic lights, bus shelters and Hillman Libraryfs windows.
And these actions, thoroughly denounced by Nordenberg, have been implicitly applauded by The
Pitt News _

Nordenberg was absolutely correct in his statement. The actions of these students quite publicly
rejected the notion that Pitt is an institution “committed to the advancement of learning and service
to society”

Pitt students on Sunday night engaged in activities thoroughly destructive to society. The crowd
gathered, and it was a party. The riot broke out, property was destroyed, and it was  Nor-
denberg clearly saw the difference, but The Pitt News failed to. ‘

To the Editor,

I am a student, a born—and—bred Pittsburgher and a Steelers fan. I love the Steelers, and I
was undoubtedly excited when we won our sixth Super Bowl.

However, breaking the windows of Hillrnan Library, breaking various windows of dedi-
cated local businesses, knocking down Port Authority bus shelters, stealing parking meters and
other acts of vandalism are absolutely inexcusable and fiercely immature actions. When I left
my dorm Monday morning and was able to survey only a portion of the damage, I was ap-
palled. More so, I was embarrassed that I had proudly called myself a Pitt student.

I was a part of the crowd, and I reveled in the mere fact of enjoying others company in
celebration, but there are certainly actions that were undeniably inappropriate and disturb-
ing. How much is it going to cost Pitt and the city of Pittsburgh to ﬁx what was broken that

night?

Israeli dancers rise above headlines

by Justin Jacobs

Batsheva Dance Company

Today, 8 p.m.

To some, they are Israel’s 
international ambassadors. To others,
they are worth protesting and picket-

It’s no surprise that the Israeli Bat-
sheva Dance Company can draw di-
visive reactions nowadays, but to Luke
Jacobs, dance isn’t a point of argument.
And it  isn’t a divider: If any-
thing, it’s a 

As the Rehearsal Director of Bat-
sheva Dance Company, which wﬂl per-
form “Three” tonight at the Benedum
Center, Jacobs witnesses  how
his dancers transcend the headlines
that surround that country and 
communicate.

"The great  about movement
is thatit’s universal—itg0es beyond
nationalistic, political views,” he said,

in 1964 by famed American choreog-
rapher Martha Graham, Batsheva has

through some of Israel’s best dancers
and, as it were, cultural ambassadors

already been awake for hours when I
called him at 9 on a Saturday morning

“Personally, I still feel very comfort-

said. “.AndIstilltrainmostdays,take

Jacobs still feels the power of dance
that Batsheva pours on the audience
— and on themselves.

Though that may sound more like
a Buddhist meditation than a modern
dance troop, Batsheva never would
have made such an impact on the
world had it stuck solely with such sub-
tieties With tonight’s performance of
“Three,” choreographed by the com-
pany’s Ohad Naharin, Batsheva’s 17

than an exercise of the mind.

“Ohad’s work isn’t like other com-

more than happy to describe in more
metaphors

movement is more bare and naked than
it used to be In older works, costumes

dramatic In a sense, ‘Three’ is more of
a polished diamond or an essential oil
than in the past,” saidJacobs

But, Jacobs insists, don’t come to
see or hear. Come to experience this
Israeli entity, all politics aside

‘'There’s a point where the audience
needs to meet the dancers in sensitiv-/0
ity to the music, to the bodies on stage
And that level is a place without politics
So ina way we don’t represent Israel,
but we represent Israel in a very beauti-
ful way.’ ’

Live music paying its dues to the tanking economy

For the past fewyears, concerts have
remained the bastion of hope for those
music fans  that the entire mu-
sic  won’t go down as 
wreckage

Total album sales ﬁrom 2008 have
decreased a staggering 45 percent since
2000, while illegal downloading has sky-
rocketed. .

Now a logical, albeit foolish, thought
here would be “Maybe Langerado just

But it’s hard to make that argument
when the proposed lineup included
heavyweights like Death Cab for Cutie,
Modest Mouse, Broken Social Scene,
Against Mel, Parliament/Funkadelic
and a  Public Enemy In other
words, it’s the economy, stupid.

And the only solution I can foresee
is this: Stop buying CDs Seriously, if
you haven’t already (though most of you
have), just stop buying CD5.

For as long as most Pitt fans can
remember, the Oakland Zoo has
been a huge part of the Pitt men’s
basketball program. Since the Pan-
thers moved to the Peterson Events
Center, they’ve had a 110-10 record
at home and consistently compete at
the top of the Big East conference

But just eight years ago, this
wasn’t the case.

_At that point, Pitt played in the
Fitzgerald Fieldhouse, and the pro-
gram had not reached the NCAA
tournament since 1993. The Oak-
land Zoo didn’t exist.

While many Panther fans have
been here for the program’s.recerit
success, only one of us was here to
watch ex-Pitt coach Ben Howland
and current coach Jamie Dixon turn
the Panthers into a national power-
house. His name is,David Jedlicka.
And as the Oakland Zoo’s president,
he’s one of the most recognized stu-
dents in the stands.

jedlicka, known by many stu-
dents as “the bald guy,” is a third year
graduate student studying audiology.
Since 2001, he said he’s missed only

“It was last year when we got
blown out by Louisville,” said
Jedlickaz “I had an exam in my night
class, and it turned out to be the
worst loss inside the Pete.”

In terms of time, Jedlicka has
spent 284 hours watching Pitt home
games. That is almost 12 days of
basketball, and it doesn’t include the
hours spent in line and warm-ups
before the game.

“It’s an experience you can’t get
anywhere else, and that’s why I go”
he said. “You feel like you are a part
of something, and when you put
the T—shirt on, you feel proud to be
a part of the Zoo.”

Jedlicka ‘started attending Pitt
‘basketball games during Ben How-
land’s second season. The student
section was nothing like the Pitt
Zoo of today.

“We weren’t anything formal,”
said Jedlicka. “There were 10 to 20
people, but we were never an orga-
nization like today.” .

But on Jan. 13, 2001, against the
then No. 15—ranked Seton Hall Pi-
rates, the Pitt Zoo was born. The
Panthers upset the heavily favored
Pirates 77-65.

Jedlicka shows

dedication to Zoo

Zoo; page 12

We all rushed the floor, and it really
took off after that,” said Jedlicka of
She game. _

At first the athletic departinent
did not recognize the Zoo, opting
to name the student section “The
Aero—Zone.” This was in reference
to Aeropostale, Pitt’s former cloth-
ing sponsor. The name never caught
on. Instead, the Zoo went to differ-
ent restaurants and stores to help
fund its T-shirts.

Before the Panthers moved into
the Pete, Pirt’s athletic department

riinally recognized the Zoo, and its
popularity started to grow.

“It was spread by word of
mouth,” said Jedlicka, who helps de-
sign the yellow “Zoo” shirts. “There

.were just a bunch of kids screaming
at basketball games, and it started to
catch on.”

Over the next six seasons, the
Panthers grew into a stronger pro-
gram and the Zoo became nation-

cognized as one of the best

    

student sections in college basket-
ball. In 2006, Big East players voted
the Pete as the 'conference’s tough-
est place to play in Sports Illustrated,
citing the Zoo as a major reason.

Despite the recognition, Jedlicka
tries to keep his task very simple

“I want to do everything possible
to create a home court advantage,”
he said. “If I could change anything,
I would want a lot of the fans you
see for big events [come out] to ev-
ery game.”

For a student who traveled 20
straight hours to attend the Duke
game last year, ]edlicka’s time along
Pitt’s sideline is  out.

‘Tm. going to finish my doctor-
ate in 2010,” he said.

And when that time comes, it’ll
beiodd to see the Zoo without him.
Because from what he has seen and
been a part of, it’s safe to sayjedlicka
has become as much a ﬁxture ir1 the
Oakland Zoo as the yellow T—shirts
themselves.
