Alleged assault victim sues Pitt, fraternities

By Jackie Duggan
and Mark Gordon
The Pitt News

Pitt and three fraternities are
being sued by a student who
alleged she was sexually
assaulted at a fraternity party
last September.

The woman claims she was
having sex in a shower with an
individual at a combine party,
held Sept. 9 and included fra-
ternities Phi Gamma Delta
(FTJI), Sigma“ Chi and Delta

5 Tau Delta, when five males

broke into the bathroom and
sexually assaulted her.

“We’re in the middle of liti-
gation,”.said Lynn Irwin, an

attorney representing the
plaintiff, 19. “It’s not that far
along right now.”

In the lawsuit, the plaintiff
claims a pledge brother from
Sigma Chi, named “Mark,”
was the individual she was
with in the bathroom. “Mark
led the plaintiff into the
upstairs bathroom [and]
demanded that she give him
oral sex, which she did,” stated
the lawsuit. “[The] plaintiff
was completely intoxicated
with alcohol by that time and
could not think clearly,” added
the lawsuit.

Irwin said the lawsuit is still
in the early stages and no court
dates have been set yet.

‘‘I’m not at liberty to talk
about strategy at this time,”
Irwin said.

A member of FIJI’s execu-
tive board, who would not
release his name, was not will-
ing to comment on the lawsuit
and said fraternity members
were advised not to comment
on the incident.

“We have told allrbrothers to
let thelawyers handle it,” he
said. '

The lawsuit specifically
mentions a FIJI brother, Brad
Ebert, as the individual who
helped the plaintiff eventually
get dressed. and take her out of
the bathroom.

Despite his silence, his

passers-by to donate spare

Irwin added that the courts

Cares    
makes it
simple to
volunteer

By Peggy Conrad
For The Pitt News

If you are looking for a good
cause where you can really
make a difference, but don’t
have a lot of time to commit,
look no further.

Students and faculty who care
can inﬂuence their world for the
better by teaming up with
Pittsburgh Cares, a unique vol-
unteer organization that brings
busy, compassionate people
together with local community
service projects to help ﬁll criti-
cal needs within the community.

In its two and a half years of
existence, Pittsburgh Cares has
coordinated 130 projects bene-
fiting 43 community service
organizations with over 3,000
hours of volunteer work.

Pittsburgh Cares does all of
the planning. All the volunteers
have to do is show up and pitch
in with the project of their
choice.

‘‘I call it ‘no excuses’ volun-
teering,” said organization presi-
dent Carolyn Falk. The 29-year-
old research librarian formed
Pittsburgh Cares with her hus-
band Mike Weiner and a few
other people, after volunteering
with a similar organization in
Washington.

One reason for the success of
Pittsburgh Cares is “the ease of
volunteering” that it provides.
Falk said. All of the service pro-
jects take place in the evening
or on weekends, so it’s conve-
nient for people with full-time
jobs or a full course load to par-

EGYPT — Archaeologists have
discovered the tomb of Ramses
11, one of ancient Egypt’s great-
est pharaohs. Ramses II is said
to have fathered more than 100
children, including 52 sons.

The tomb is a vast under-

ground complex of 67 burial
chambers and the largest tomb
ever explored in the Valley of
the Kings. Dr. Kent R. Weeks,
the archaeologist who made the
find, said he believes there is
another level of chambers below
the ones already discovered
which may contain 40 additional
rooms. I
L Archaeologists believe the
tomb contains the remains of at
least 50 of Ramses II’s royal
sons and it could be the largest
tomb in all of Egypt. —— New

TOKYO —— Thousands of
police officers conducted raids
Tuesday morning and arrested
the guru of the Aum Shinrikyo
religious sect on charges of orga-
nizing the nerve gas attack on
the Tokyo subway system.
Shoko Asahara was arrested
while meditating in the sect’s

headquarters, near Mount Fuji.

Authorities hope the arrest of
Mr. Asahara and 40 of his fol-
lowers will end what a Japanese
Cabinet member described as
“like a war” between the sect
and the Japanese Government.
Since the March 20 subway
attack that killed 12 people and

injured 5,500, many Japanese
have lived in fear about taking
trains or going to public places. -

SARAJEVO — Mortar fire
rocked Sarajevo front lines
Tuesday, and fighting moved
from one key section of a
Bosnian-Serb supply corridor to
another.

The fire took place near the
Jewish cemetery, a front line
southwest of downtown
Sarajevo, and at least 13 mortar
shells landed. Government
forces in the area responded with
heavy machine gun fire. One
civilian was killed and four were
wounded in and around Sarajevo
on Monday. — Pittsburgh Post-

WASHINGTON — In an effort
to balance the federal budget,
Congress is nearing a vote to cut
more than $250 billion in
Medicare savings by 2002. A
variety of health policy experts
say it is not likely the money can
be extracted by the Republicans’
self-imposed deadlines.
“There’s no way to do this
without imposing real sacriﬁce

and real pain,” said Robert D. "
Reischauer, senior fellow at the

Brookings Institution. 0
Experts also say slowing
spending that much in that short
a time will mean charging bene-

TRENTON, N.J. — A court
decision not to allow a man’s

son to bear his father’s last name .

resulted in the death of his three-

Alan Gubemat took his son’s
life, placing a .357-caliber hand-
gun next to the boy’s head and
pulling the trigger. Gubemat
then shot himself.

The bodies were found
Sunday, three days after the
child’s mother won a New
Jersey Supreme Court case
allowing her son to carry her last
name, rather than his father’s.

OKLAHOMA CITY —
Government officials, mental
health workers and demolition
experts are debating the “psy-
chological ramifications” in
using explosives instead of
cranes and wrecking balls to top-
ple the remains of the nine-story
building. a

According to Douglas
Loizeaux, vice president of
Controlled Demolition Inc.,
there was serious discussion
about whether more explosions
would be traumatizing to people.

Officials decided that by using
explosions instead of a crane, the
building will come down weeks
sooner and the mending process
can begin that much quicker for
the people of Oklahoma. — New

The Pitt News, Wednesday, May'17, 1995

Panhandlers

joined the “Change for the Better”
campaign, said Mike Donovan, sec-
retary for Oakland Business and
Civic Association (OBCA). The
businesses post the signs on their

windows and inside provide cans for .

customers to drop change into.

The OBCA will donate the money
collected to Jubilee Kitchen and
Peoples Oakland. The campaign
began April 21. Though the money
collected so far hasn’t been counted,
OBCA estimates that if everybody
who comes into Oakland every day
at one time during the year puts two
quarters into a cannister, they would
raise $50,000.

The cannisters provide an altema-
tive to students in Oakland who want
to help the needy, said Catherine
Kunsak, business analyst with the
Small Business Development Center.
Also, businesses hope it will dimin-
ish the numbers of panhandlers out
on the street. “

“They wanted to do something to
help the panhandlers  but to dis-
courage them from coming” and
standing on the street, Kunsak said.

But some say that this campaign
will not help the panhandlers and
that the campaign grew out of mis-
conceptions about panhandlers.
These misconceptions include that
panhandlers make a lot of: money
and that they only spend the money
on drugs and alcohol.

“I don’t know if [the campaign] is
going to handle the problem,” said
Seth Kurzban, who works with
Operation: Save A Life. Jubilee
Kitchen and Peoples Oakland
already provide services to the needy
but these services don't necessarily
help panhandlers.

Operation Save A Life has not
officially responded to the “Change
for the Better” campaign. But the
organization provides services to the
homeless and has repeatedly
opposed‘ anti-panhandling ordi-

nances. Dan Robinson, coordinator
of OSAL, has said that anti-panhan-
dling ordinances tend to label all
panhandlers as aggressive and
infringe on their constitutional
rights.

“Just as you have a right to say no,
they should have a right to ask,”
Kurzban said.

Most panhandlers are usually on
some type of assistance and panhan-
dling just augments their income to
buy food, Kurzban said.

“When I come here I usually don’t
have money in my pocket,” Brewer
said. “I’m not trying to get rich pan-
handling.”

Brewer says he receives disability
which covers his rent. He says he
comes to Oakland to collect money

for a hamburger, a Coke and some-‘

times cigarettes. He says he collects
about $7 or $8 a day to buy these
amenities, then leaves.

Kurzban says he thinks one of the
goals of the Change for the Better
campaign is to get panhandlers out
of sight. .

“Basically people just don’t want
to acknowledge another human
being’s existence,” he said. “They
don’t want to see them around.”

But those with OBCA deny that
their goal is to sweep panhandlers
off the street.

“The idea is to turn a negative into
a positive,” said Kunsak, “to show
that there is help for the panhan-
dlers, that they don’t have to stand
out there on the street.”

The campaign extends an opportu-
nity to people who study and work in
Oakland to help the needy with the
assurance that their money goes to
charitable organizations, Donovan
said.

“I don’t think we’re attempting to
weed out anyone,” said Donovan.

“We just want to let the public know
that if you give to [panhandlers]
there’s no way to know where your

money’s going. It could go for ciga-
rettes and alcohol. It could get a
hamburger.”

“If individuals don’t like panhan-
dlers they shouldn’t give to panhan-
dlers because that encourages the
system,” he said. When you give to a
panhandler, “you’re feeding a sys-
tem that a lot of people detest.”

Merchant Reaction

Marion Matthews, a local business
manager, lost a clerk because a pan-
handler followed him home and
threatened his life. The incident
scared the clerk so much, he quit.

She also remembers after telling a
panhandler to leave the premises, the
panhandler pointed to her and drew
his index finger across his neck.
With that motion, he implied that he
would cut her throat. ,

So two weeks ago, Matthews hap-
pily posted the “Change for the
Better” sign on the store’s window,
hoping it would help ease a tense sit-
uation.

Student donations to the campaign
have made the cannisters heavy with
coins. A representative from OBCA
recently collected the filled cannis-
ters.

“When she picked it up on
Monday, you couldn’t put another
penny in it,” Matthews said.’

An employee at another Oakland
business on Forbes Avenue also
expressed enthusiasm with the pro-
gram.

“I was glad to see it,” said Cathy
Veltum. “There’s [a panhandler] at
every ten feet practically. You can’t
ever walk down here without some-
one asking for money.”

Givers and Takers

William Sledge, 43, stretches his
arms out to a passer-by and says
“Help me out please.”

He sits “with his cup on a doorway
step on Atwood Street and repeats

 

his plea often. Most passers-by
shake their heads and answer his
outstretched hands with upturned

palms that are empty.

One man wearing a suit and tie

says, “Help me!”

“I just ignore them,” Sledge says
while explaining how he feels about
‘these kinds of responses. “They’re

ignorant.”

Panhandlers have become part of
the daily street scene for Pitt stu-
Some have
resolved to never give to panhan-
dlers because they suspect the
money goes for drugs and alcohol.
Some have been harassed, intimidat-

dents and workers.

ed and annoyed. Some just give.

“Hi, how are you doing?” a woman
asks Sledge. She smiles, gives him
some change and says, “Have a good

day.”

This is not the first time Cheryl
Ruffin, an employee at Pitt, has
given money to Sledge. She seeshim
sitting on the doorstep often and

buys him coffee.

“Because it says in the Bible that
what you do for the lesserof my‘
people, you’re doing for me,” Ruffin
explains. ‘‘I’m giving from my heart
and [don’t] pass judgement on what

he’s using it for.”

Annette Panebianco has given food
to panhandlers, but never gives
money. She has also been harassed

by panhandlers, some going as far as
following her to her car.

She says she agrees with the
“Change for the Better” campaign

because she believes most panhan-

dlers use the money for drugs and

alcohol.

A graduate nurse, Panebianco

works at Western Psychiatric

Institute and Clinic (WPIC) on a unit

that treats patients with a combina-
tion of mood disorders and alcohol
and drug addiction.

“All the projects seem to have

Mulhern said. She said she is
interested in doing “more of a

Maryhouse, a homeless shelter

There, Mulhern said, “You feel

Each month, Pittsburgh. Cares
mails a calendar of events to its
over 400-member volunteer net-
work. The calendar allows the
volunteers to choose projects
according to their interests and
availability. The volunteer then
contacts the project coordinator
who acts as a liaison between the
volunteers, community service
organizations, and Pittsburgh
Cares. _

“[Volunteering] has opened up
a whole new world for me,” said
project coordinator Sara

days designing airports for a
local engineering firm, but when
not in the office she still has a lot
to offer.

“The one thing that makes me

introduced me to an incredible
group of people.”

Walfoort is currently the coor-

donated medical supplies for
Global Links, which redistrib-
utes the life-saving materials to

“provides people with things

could not comment on the case because it is currently in litiga-

tion.

“It is a very unfortunate incident,” said Chancellor J. Dennis

O’Connor.

After several attempts, Greek Adviser Kerry Daley could not

be reached for comment.

Pitt Police ran into continuous road blocks in the investiga-
tion, including a lost guest list, uncooperative fraternity brothers
and a shaky memory from the victim, due to her intoxication at
the party. No arrests have been made in the case.

However, Leon Haley, vice chancellor for student and public
affairs, did take action against the fraternities last October.

In a report released to the “university community,” Haley
acknowledged that a sexual assault did take place at the fratemi-
ty party, as well as underage drinking.

FIJI was placed on social probation for one year, and Delta
Tau Delta and Sigma Chi were placed on probation for the
remainder of the fall term. The fraternities were also ordered to

perform community service.

Panhandlers

through that unit.

Sledge has been in and out
of Western Psych ten times.
He says his mental problems
make it impossible for him to
hold a job. He worked at a
daycare center three or four
years ago but he lost the job
when he had to be admitted
to Western Psych. .

Sledge receives disability
payments that covers his
rent. He sits on the doorstep
in Oakland to collect money
for food and cigarettes and
makes about $30 a week.

Social agencies exist that
would help people like
Sledge, with mental disor-
ders, to get a job, Panebianco
said.

“It’s more effective to go
get jobs and utilize SSI (dis-
ability) in a better way,” she
said. “Some of them don’t
want to get ajob.”

After leaving Western
Psych for the tenth time,
Sledge did not want to pan-

‘ handle anymore. It’s been his

job for five years.

“I strongly dislike this,”
Sledge said. “I’m just tired of
it.”

Although he’s aware of
social agencies that can help
him get a job, Sledge’s confi-
dence in his ability to keep a
job drained away when he
lost his job at the daycare
center.

Anand Rao, a Pitt graduate
student, says he has more
empathy for panhandlers who
are older and obviously
handicapped. Although his
wife has been harassed sever-
al times by panhandlers, Rao
says panhandlers still have
the right to ask for money.

But the “Change for the

Better” campaign may help
people to “be more informed
about how to give,” he said.

Emily Stiger, a Pitt senior,
agrees that the campaign will
be a better way to help the
needy.

“I think it’s better than just
giving them money,” she
said. “At least you know
where the money’s going.”

Stiger says she has never
felt intimidated by panhan-
dlers, but has doubts when
she gives them money.

“I kind of feel like I’m
being taken for a ride.”

Doubts like these have
been echoed in the minds of
other Pitt students.

“They’re trying to milk us
for money,” said Bryan
Carrigan, a Pitt senior.

Carrigan described panhan-
dlers as loud and obnoxious
but says he doesn’t feel
intimidated to give to them.
He probably won’t give to
“Change for the Better”
either.

“I don’t make enough
money to waste it that way.”

Sledge acknowledges that
many of his fellow panhan-
dlers use intimidation to
draw money from students,
but he says he doesn’t use
those tactics.

“I just try-to do it right
myself and be polite and
courteous,” Sledge said.

A man passes by Sledge’s
doorstep, smiles and gives
Sledge a cigarette. Kenneth
Edwards, studying to be a
minister, says a year ago he
didn’t give anything to pan-
handlers. But it has become
part of his nature to give, he
says.

“We really have to help
them,” he said. “The sys-

Better place for change

You may have noticed a lot of red and white signs decorat-
ing the store fronts on Forbes and Fifth Avenues over the past
few weeks. The signs advertise a new program called
“Change for the Better”, sponsored by the Oakland Business
and Civic Association. The program encourages Oakland
shoppers to donate their pocket change to cans inside the
businesses instead of putting thatchange into the cups of
panhandlers .on the streets. The money from these cans will
be donated to the Jubilee Kitchen and Peoples Oakland,
places where the homeless and needy can find assistance.

Many people have objected to the program, claiming that
panhandlers have a right to ask for money on the street.
However, the Change for the Better program is not intended
to deprive anyone of that right. The program is designed to
provide people withan opportunity to help the homeless and
needy, without them having to question what their donations
are going to be used for. I

Opposition to the program also claims that Change for the
Better is merely a disguised attempt to drive panhandlers
away from Oakland’s storefronts and corners. The program
could certainly have that effect if Oaklanders listen to the
signs and “don’t give to panhandlers... [but] give to a whole
lot more”; panhandlers are in Oakland because it is accepted
as a commonplace practice. If people did give to the Change
program instead of panhandlers then yes, panhandling might
slowly disappear from Oakland’s streets. The money raised
for the Jubilee Kitchen and People’s Oakland would still,
however, benefit those who are in need of assistance.

It should also be remembered that no one is forcing people
not to give money to panhandlers; the Change program mere-
ly offers an alternative way to help out those who need it. 

It is impossible to make a blanket statement about panhan-
dlers in general. It would be a grievous injustice to label pan-
handlers as inherently “bad” people, because there is no way
to tell exactly who is and who is not honestly in need of
assistance. Some are undoubtedly what they seem, impover-
ished men and women trying to pay for a decent meal.
However, there is also no way to distinguish between the per-
son who will empty his or her cup of money onto a counter
for a hamburger or pint of milk, who will empty his or her
cup onto the nearest bar’s counter for a shot or a beer, or who
might empty his or her cup for a pack of cigarettes or a quick
fix.

The Change program ensures would-be philanthropists that
their money will go toward assisting those poor people who
need assistance instead of supplying someone else’s drug or
alcohol addiction. Though the program is certainly not a cure
for homelessness or poverty, it is certainly a step in the right
direction Next time you see one of these red and white can-
nisters in a store, drop whatever change you can spare into it
and know that you are helping someonewho needs it.

rom the
time he
was 19

 years old, duck-

ng bullets
 while flying
; planes over

Japan, fighting
for his country
in World War
11, George
Bush has proven to America
he has guts.

Unlike Bill Clinton, the
s1ick—talking, smooth, spin
doctor expert that currently
occupies the Oval Office,
Bush talks straight from -the
heart and he backs up his
words with action. But more
on Clinton later.

The former president is in
the news again, turning up in
Op-ed pages across the coun-
try, and he is being praised by
liberal hotbeds, like The New
York Times and The
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.

Bush resigned from the
National Rifle Association
last week, and the move is
sure to upset some partisan
bigwigs in the Republican
Party. In an era where partisan
politics is becoming the norm,
Bush made a courageous
move. Bush exited the NRA
after reading a fund-raising
letter from the group that
called federal law enforce-
ment officials, specifically the
BATF, “jack-booted govern-
ment thugs who harass, intim-
idate, even murder law-abid-
ing citizens.”

Although I agree with most
of what the NRA stands for
politically, such as their oppo-
sition to gun control laws, the

 

-group is way out of line in

this case.

1 Federal law enforcement
officials, such'as agents in the
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms are on the whole
hard-working, dedicated
Americans who put their lives
on the line every day.
Murdering thugs is hardly a
proper description of these

dwvsfmul

 

    
 
  
  

men and women.

So Bush ripped up his mem-
bership card, saying the letter
“deeply offends my own sense
of decency and honor, and it
offends my concept of service
to country” (Pittsburgh Post
Gazette, May 12.). Now of
course it’s easy to look at
what Bush did and say he had
nothing to lose — he’s no
longer in office and he’s not
running for office —— but it
proves that not all politicians
are party wannabes who don’t
have a mind of their own.

The president of the NRA,
Tom Washington, said that
Bush acted hastily in his deci-
sion to bolt from the organiza-
tion. Washington wrote in
Friday’s U.S.A. Today that the
BATF is an agency that has
been in trouble before. In fact,
according to Washington, the
Reagan-Bush administration
once tried to crack down on
the federal agency.
Washington claims it’s not
just incidents like Waco,
Texas, that show abuses of
power by the feds.

“You hear stories about can-
cer medicines thrown all over
the floor, family pets stomped
to death,” writes Washington.

I’m not naive enough to
suggest that no one in the
BATF has made a mistake
before, but Washington might
just be a little off his rocker.

And lets talk about Waco.
Why is it that the Feds are the
ones that shoulder the blame.
David Koresh is the wacko
that locked innocent people
up in a “compound” (whatev-
er that is?) and had a cult
operating around the clock for
months.

The only mistake the feds
made was waiting as long as
they did to storm the Koresh
compound. And that was
Attorney General Janet
Reno’s decision, not the
BATF’s.

The BATF has its problems,
just like every other federal
bureaucracy. But they are not

it “" ':“—-W_+’l 2.2

  

   

“murdering thugs.”

Bush’s departure from the
NRA hopefully will send a
message to the leading GOP
presidential candidates,
Senators Phil Gramm and
Robert Dole. Both of them
should, at the minimum,
denounce Washington and the
NRA. Gramm is scheduled to
speak at an NRA convention
this week. He should honor
his commitment, speak and
tell the -NRA they were
wrong.

While Bush has courage
that is wide open and visible
to the American public, Bill
Clinton’s heart could not be
found with a laboratory
microscope.

‘A few months ago Clinton
denounced Hollywood for
producing movies and televi-
sion shows that promote vio-
lence in America’s youth.
While a little misguided,
Clinton raised a good issue.

The only problem is a week
later, he spent a weekend with
Steven Spielberg and Barbara
Streisand, prime Hollywood
players, gathering $2 million
for the Democratic Party.

Also, look at the Henry
Foster fiasco. Like almost
every other Clintonappointee,
this one was poorly
researched. He took a compe-
tent, hard-working, responsi-
ble doctor, threw him to the
wolves in Congress, and six
months later the President still
hasn’t backed him up strong-
ly.

Bush was brave enough to
back up Clarence Thomas, his
nominee for Supreme Court in
1992, and he had the courage
to take a stand againstithe
NRA and back up his words
with action.

Maybe Dole and Gramm
aren’t the only ones who can
learn something from George
Bush.

Priest

Directed by Antonia Bird

With Linus Floache and Tom
Wilkinson

Taking as much time to build
a tense, multi-layered drama
as argue for progressive
change within the Catholic
Church, Priest is a topical and
comprehensive British social
drama minus the soap opera.
Jim McGovern’s script hits on
some very real issues clergy-
men and women have been
debating for some years, such
as the reconciliation between
sexual desire and the vow of
celibacy, whether the Bible
condones or condemns homo-

sexuality and whether the vow 

of confessional secrecy should
be disregarded in order to end
another’s suffering. in essence

Priest offers lively political-
philosophical discussion
designed to question Catholic
traditions and dogma and pro-
pose a more humanistic struc-
ture for one of the world’s most
powerful institutions. All of
which may sound unnecessari-
ly weighty, but Priest is told
with such an accessibility,
oftentimes comical, that it is
nothing short of thoroughly
engaging.

V At worst Priest is a didactic
exercise in pedantry, but disre-
gard the conclusion’s some-
times preachy tone and what
we’re gratefully in receipt of is
a poignant humanistic film in
the spirit of socialist-reforma-
tion. What we get are two
priests at philosophical logger-
heads working in an urban

 

poverty-stricken parish. The
younger, more strict proponent
of Catholic traditions Father
Greg (Linus Roache) arrives at
the elder’s parish to encounter
Father Matthew’s (Tom
Wilkinson) progressive ser-

(l

mons and more tolerant val-
ues. Priest's world is one
where even the devout doubt
the existence of God, and who
sometimes approach the injus-
tices of society without any
clear-cut theological answers.

  

I-’c'i'dﬂ.'$'.%"§l'vii'l§

In order to discuss the
Church’s poli-theological evo-
lution, the script introduces
characters who could have
been drawn two-dimensionally
but are fleshed-out fully and
offer emotional believability.

Despite his more conservative
interpretation of Catholic tradi-
tions, Father Greg finds him-
self involved with Graham
(Robert Carlyle) after visiting a
gay bar. Bird’s camera does a
good job illustrating Greg’s

 

anxiety and feelings of guilt fol-
lowing the night with Graham.
With a touch of stylization, the
sequence that follows is one of
paranoia and kinetic camera-
work. Greg’s feelings of guilt

‘become more complicated

when a teenage girl Lisa
Unsworth (Christine Tremarco)
tells him in confession that her
father is forcibly having sex
with her. Torn between his
vow of secrecy and his desire
to intervene and help the girl,

Priest runs at the Beehive, aand, this week at 3, 5:(/1,7 0 ad :30 Sunday-Friday, ith a 1 pm how at.

Greg questions the existence
of God and redemption in a
world that seems so unjust
and intolerant.

For the most part these sce-
narios are used to examine the
central conflicts contemporary
priests may face: how to rec-

 

 

oncile personal differences
with the Church and at the
same time serve the institution
they've placed so much faith
in. For Father Greg the contra-
dictions seem to be irreconcil-
able, and when he seeks
advice from another father he
is told to get out of the priest-
hood and “Love who you want,
-when you want.” Without a
succinct resolution to the com-
plicated issues it presents,
Priest offers thorough drama

   

that involves several levels of
church and state, personal and
public conflicts and problemat-
ic moral uncertainties that
have always accompanied the
Catholic Church.

the under-age dilema and am
finding out that there is more
quality all-ages entertainment
than I know what to do with.
Case in point: the upcoming
Pavement show this Thursday
at Grafitti.

Once obscure indie darlings,
now MTV indie darlings,
Pavement is a joy to see live.
Last year I had the privilege to
see them twice and was
impressed with both encoun-
ters. The first show was at the

compliments about the live
performance of the band. If
you missed them at Skibo HAII

The Dirty Three will start the

drums, bass, guitar and violin
has been creating a stir in the
indie rock community as of

into words. They mix jazz,
indie rock, eastern folk and
punk into an original blend of
sonic brilliance. The band
plays intense and brooding
music that makes much of the
passionless alterna rock run

is their latest effort; expect
more from this band. _
There you have it. This is

lining Lollapalooza. Jeepersl
What do you expect? They
broke punk in ‘92, signed to
DGC, and continue to put out
some of the most consistent
records in rock’n’roll history.
Sonic Youth is an instituion, a
living legend, and
Lollapalooza isn’t out of line
considering the 14-year evo-
lution of the band. But is this
a good thing? They were
once in the forefront of exper-
imental rock, playing shows
for twenty-five kids who loved
noize, now they entertain
people who love Pearl Jam.
Well, good thing not, the
world has caught up to them.
The sound is more common-
place, but Sonic keeps deliv-
ering music that they’ve been
comfortable making for years,
despite the size of the audi-
ence.

Forget the sell out argu-
ment. Consider this: is Sonic
Youth still a viable band
putting out interesting music?
Although I've moved on to
newer bands, I still buy and
enjoy their records. No matter
what they do, it is musical
and I'll probably like it. This,
however, is enough for many
indie rock fans to cry out.

. The word is out and leave it 

uproar: Sonic Youth is head- ’

   

“Boring!” I've heard several
people suggest that the band
break up and pursue ongoing
solo projects. Whether fans

‘consider the side projects

more interesting musically, or
more ethically sound (f*ck
corporate r*ck), the indie
community loves what it sees
and hears in this respect. For
starters, Steve Shelly owns
and operates Smells Like
Records, a label responsable
for records by stalwarts The
Raincoats and WPTS
favorites, Blonde Redhead.
Thurston Moore also runs a
label, Ecstatic Peace, which
puts out the likes of Guv’ner,
a budding, hip new outfit. On
the avant garde side of
music, Lee Renaldo’s Gate
project has gained some
acclaim, as has his Table of
the Elements 7” (Thurston
Moore also has a TOTE 7”).
Both projects are composi-
tion-oriented peices in which
Lee displays his Branca
inspired / free jazz sensabili—
ty. Kim Gordon is also a force
to be reckoned with. Her
band, Free Kitten, is by far
one of the best punk bands
around. She joins forces with

indie legends Julie Kafritz,
Yoshimi and Mark lbold,
proving she is in tune with the
new school attitude. I think all
of this buzz signals that SY
realizes that a band situation
has a certainpotential, but
certain limits. The side activi-
ties might attest to their
understanding of the band’s
niche, and give them a way to
greater express themselves
artistically.

In comes another Sonic
Youth offshoot. The band is
appropriately named
Thurston Moore, the record is
called Psychic Hearts. It fea-
tures Mr. Moore on guitar and
vocals, fellow Sonic Youther
Steve Shelly on drums and
Half Japanese/Two Dollar
Guitar veteran Tim Folijhan
on the other guitar. That’s
right —— no bass. It might not

~ sound like the typical power

trio, but it’s damn close! Who
needs a bass, anyway? The
recordis lush and full-sound-
ing, a bass would get in the
way. This description also
holds up to their occasional
live performance. I saw this
group at CMJ’s Music
Marathon last year and they
jammed forcefully and con-
vincingly. I found out that the
show I saw was one of the
first live gigs they had;
Thurston had the lyrics print-
ed out on big flash cards.
Regardless, the group was
tight.

If I could categorize the
sound, or maybe put it into
the side project perspective, it
falls closer to the Kitten side
of things. This group is not
about creating thick walls of
noise and feedback, or cyclic
wordless compositions. It’s
more about punk and power
pop. lt’s like Sonic Youth

without the craziness and
more of the bad ass rock
vibe. No, this isn’t some clas-

sic rock revival ala Royal

Trux Thurston is rooted into
art punk like the Swell Maps
and hardcore, sothe. music
takes on a similar energetic
feel. There is plenty of jerky,
sing-song rants, but there are
a few slack-fueled jems as
well. Steve Shelley’s drum-
ming ‘is straight forward and
snappy———he keeps it simple
and to the point. Follijhan and
Moore’s guitars ease from the
ever-popular guitar drone,
instead opt for the crunchy,
jarring rythms and/or angular
chord arpeggios. All of the
songs are short punk clas-
sics, or slightly more drawn-
out mellow strums. The last
track is twenty minutes long
and simply explosive. It is the
most Sonic Youth-sounding
song on the record and starts
slow, only to build up and
explode into chaos.

This is a great effort from
Thurston, and Co. I
recomend buying it if you like
any aspect of Sonic Youth.
lt’s unbridled Thurston: this is
what would happen if his
presence in SY wasn’t
checked and balanced by the
other members. All of
Moore’s pop culture fixations,
his punk and stoner fixations
come out. Buy the vinylll It's
a double record of sorts —
one clear green platter, the‘
other’s black and etched on
one side. The art work and
etching is great thanks to Rita
Ackerman, and we all know
that vinyl sounds better.
Forget the Lolla-hype, and
bickering indie rockers, just
listen to the record.

Tales from the

Hood Soundtrack

Various Artists
MCA Soundtracks

If you could see horror hip-
hop, it would look like a rot-

gold front inscribed with
Damien’s death numbers
chillin’ with dark black
shades. But to hear it, you
gotta check out the Tales
from the Hood soundtrack,
which features a collage of

coast-to-coast.

Spike Lee, the executive
album producer, put his
movie-making career on hold
to compile a 12-cut bomb
with artists ranging from Wu-
Tang Clan to MC Eiht to
Gravediggaz to Ol’ Dirty
Bastard to Spice 1. While
most of the tracks and raps
are air—tight, the album lacks
contextual diversity, focusing
on all street tell-all tales of
cold-blooded murder in the
hood. But even the most East
Coast, old-schoo|—oriented
fanatic can appreciate this
predominantly gangsta album
that captures the mindset of
ghetto vagabonds that exist
in every ‘hood.

Spike opens with a Wu-
Tang joint, but the song “Let
Me At Them” should have an
asterisk next to it, because .
it’s minus Method Man and
Ol’ Dirty Bastard. Without the
two, the song lacks the Clan’s
trademark chaotic flow and
New York beat. Although they
keep the same high-pitched
piano track, Wu-Tang just
isn’t the same since Method
Man and ODB went solo.

believer out of you in his debut
album, this jam definitely will.
This behemoth cut is a sure-
fire choice on every mixed
tape.

Doubt.Spice 1 no longer —
he’s for real. Spice sticks with
his same psycho-slaying phi-

 

‘ losophy as he establishes his

cap-peeling position from the
first bullet hole. Glorifying
gore, Spice’s “kill ‘em all” lyrics
blow through the forehead and
lodge in the back of the brain
as his shit sticks permanently
in your mind: ‘‘I’m having long
conversations with Mr.
Millimeterl He’s one of my best
friends/ bitch-ass nigger
eater.” Couple his hard-hitting
venom with a hectic piano, an
eerie synthesizer and a gun-
shot break, and you’ll be think-
ing you're in a bad dream.

The rest of the album's rap
renowns, MC Eiht and the
Gravediggaz, provide nothing
new as they stick to their same
formula. MC Eiht still

“cheaaas” about 50 times a
song with his traditional string
symphony, boomin’ bass and
gun fire track. it’s not good, not
bad, it’s just there. As long as
the Gravediggaz have Prince
Paul, a.k.a. the Undertaker,
their tracks will always be but-
ter. But there’s only so much
Prince Paul can do when he’s
shackled to the haunted horror
rap fad. But again, he came
through with something new,
kind of, » as he created a
spooky track laced with wicked
drum rolls. Mix that with
Grymreaper’s animated voice
changes, and ya got another
listenable song.

Thanks to Spike, Tales has
a perfect blend of hip-hop vet-
erans and prospering rookies.
But Spike must have been
smoking one of his Joints
when he chose Domino to per-
form the title cut, “Tales from
the Hood.” Domino has this
delusion that he’s a Fi&B and

he just ain’t. He should stick I

strictly to his half-rap, half-
singing style, because his Fl&B
career is going nowhere.

Tales snags the consumer
with its all-star cast, but the lit-
tle, unknown names with the

-big-time clout is what really
sets the hook and reels in the
listener.

Look out world — Bokie Loc

faceted raspy voice and

The Vox, Wednesday, May 17, 1995

Brown, Lucy, Linus and the
rest of Charles Schulz’s gang;
while Ellis’ trio plays six tunes
written by Vince Guaraldi, who
composed the original Peanuts
soundtrack.

Wynton describes in the liner
notes his reasoning for choos-
ing Peanuts as the theme for
this album. He says that the
Peanuts have the same uni-
versal appeal as jazz does
across the world. Marsalis tells
us that people everywhere can
relate to both. I’m not so sure.it
was a good idea.

The album starts with
Wynton’s septet playing an
original arrangement of the
familiar Peanuts theme. l was
pretty turned off at first by the
idea of listening to an entire
album of Peanuts music,» it
seemed a little childish. As I
listened, though, I came to
appreciate the arrangements
that Wynton wrote. The har-
monies he used between the
four horns were very cool, very
slick. He puts into these famil-
iar, slightly infantile tunes his
usual doses of Duke Ellington
and ragtime influences.
Sometimes he pulls it off, like
on track one, “Linus and Lucy,”
but more often he tries too
hard to sound like Ellington
and he sounds contrived.
Track four, “On A Peanuts

Playground” is such an over-
dose of the Ellington motif that
I was tempted to make a fris-
bee of the CD.

But Wynton has made some
good along with the bad. To
his credit, he has started a

resurgence in the music of
Duke Ellington, which is some-
thing that should have been
done a long time ago. Wynton
just couldn't pull it off with this
album. Here, his playing lacks
the necessary depth and char-
acter to make an album like
this work. Wynton struggles to
give this album an identity
beyond the superficial Peanuts
exterior. His trumpet solos
flounder through the chord
changes without direction,
while his band follows his aim-
less path. I think Wynton tried
to bring back Ellington’s music
and wasn’t inspired to do so.
The result is an album that
sounds like someone trying to
make-too many ideas work,

' and it just doesn’t.

The other half of the album
is played by the Ellis Marsalis
trio. The six Vince Guaraldi
tunes that pianist Ellis plays
are all fairly recognizable
Peanuts songs. That, howev-
er, is where the fun stops.
Ellis’ playing is lackluster and
uninspired, basically boring.
The worst part of his half-of the
album is that it alternates
tracks with Wynton, breaking
up any sort of flow that Wynton
was able to achieve.

My recommendation:
Wynton’s previous album, Citi
Movements, is a much better
examplerof his fusion of con-
temporary/ragtimelEllingtonian
jazz than Joe Cool’s Blues is.
The album is, at best, an inter-
esting experiment that doesn't
work.

Duncan lege to test

his wiry,

teenage frame in the big
show.

Garnett, a rail-thin 6-foot-
10 dunking madman, hasn’t
even received his high
school diploma from
Farragut Academy in
Chicago and has already
dropped his name, along
with the other dozen or so
strapping young men, to
enter June’s NBA draft.

Only three other high

gone straight to the pros -

Dawkins and Bill
Willoughby. Seventeen years
have elapsed since Dawkins
and Willoughby last entered
the NBA straight from high
school. Malone did it in
1975.

Many people have criti-
cized Garnett for taking the
plunge, saying it’s going to
ruin his career. But what
happens if he gets injured
tomorrow — will the NBA
still want him then? It’s his
prerogative if he wants to go
early. Sure, he’s missing
invaluable experience and
maturity, but.he’s getting
paid. And basically, that’s all
everything is about nowa-
days, isn’t it? The longevity
of an athlete is limited, so
why not get the dividends
when they can?

But oftentimes, the risk
doesn’t pay off.

It’s a huge jump going
straight from the care-free ‘
days of high school to the
rigorous 82-game schedule
and thousands of other dis-
tractions that go along with
the NBA, like the media,
women and traveling. Sure
all high school superstars
have experienced that, but
not under such tight scrutiny

Piﬂ upsets I‘-‘run-s in playoffs

By Sean Duncan
Managing Editor

Just when the Big East competition
thought it erased the Pitt baseball

team from the playoff picture, the '

Panthers bounced back to win their
last five out of six league games to
creep into the playoffs.

And just when the Providence Friars
thought they were sitting pretty atop
the conference heading into the Big
East playoffs yesterday, Pitt gave
them a dose of reality.

The Panthers handed the nationally
ranked Friars a 6-2 loss in the first
game of the double—elimination play-
offs at Muzzy Field in Bristol, Conn.
In the process, Pitt notched its first
ever Big East Tournament win.

“We played with a lot of enthusi-
asm,” Pitt coach Mark Jackson said.
“We were really relaxed and had fun.
It’s a credit to the kids."

The No. 1 seeded Friars, who went
41-ll during the season and 16-5 in
Big East play, entered the tournament
knowing the regular season champion
has never won the Big East tourna-
ment. Pitt should know, it won the
regular season title last year and was
eliminated early. *

“Teams like us coming in are a lot
more relaxed because there’s less
pressure,” Jackson said.

and 12-9 in the Big East), used a stel-

A week after two first—place V//

right where he left off. He
captured the Men’s Track
Most Valuable Performer
award in last Saturday’s
Marauder «Track & Field
Classic IV, held at Central
State University in
Wilberforce, Ohio.

Despite bad weather, Jells
took the gold in the 100-meter
dash with a time of 10.37. Jay
Jones took third at 10.

50, and Anthony Dorsett Jr.
was sixth at 10.65. ,

“It was cold, windy and
rainy — everything you don’t
want at a meet,” said coach
Steve Lewis.

Another Panther with a
first-place finish was senior
Frank Nesko, who won the
1,500-meter..run. He set a new
meet record with a time of
3:52.24.

Nesko followed up his first-
place finish by takingsecond
place in the 800—meter run at
1:53.56. He barely missed the
top spot, as Ashland
University’s Eric Barry fin-
ished with 1:53.18. Teammate A

Women's pair nabs bronze in
PI1iIIy's 57th Dad Vail Regatta

By Brad Isles
Sports Editor

Last Friday the Pitt men’s and women’s crew
teams travelled to the largest college regatta in
the world. Held in Philadelphia, the Dad Vail
Regatta dates back to 1934.

“It’s really exciting,” said Maureen
McGuigan, who competed on the women’s
lightweight four boat. “This is what we train for
all season long.”

Pitt was one of 98 American and Canadian
colleges and universities entered the 57th edi-
tion of this event. Competition consisted of 19
different categories of pairs, fours and eights.

Temple was the favorite entering the Dad Vail
in the men’s division. The Owls’ men’s varsity
eight boat had won 11 of their previous 12
appearances in the meet.

They continued their streak, winning their
seventh straight varsity eight heavyweight race,
with time of 5:47.77, defeating Michigan
(5254.51) by seven seconds. Drexel was third at
5:55.07. .

The previous two years, the Michigan squad
had skipped the Dad Vail for the Champion
International Collegiate Regatta, held in
Worcester, Mass. But, after a late delivery of its
entry form, Michigan was denied admission
and opted for the Dad Vail.

It proved to be a twist of fate, as the
Michigan women’s team edged out Temple in

its varsity eight heavyweight race, 6:42.31 to
6:45.02. Toronto finished third at 6:55.18.

The Lady Wolverines were also one of two
teams selected by a special selection committee
to attend the Henley Royal Regatta in England
next month. The trip is funded by the Dad Vail.

Florida Tech’s men’s heavyweight four will
also be making the trip, after its six—second win
over Villanova.

In last year’s Dad Vail, the Panthers’ men’s
varsity heavyweight four finished second
behind Florida Tech, but the Pitt did not medal
this year. s

The Pitt men’s freshman novice eight crew
was also unable to repeat its performance from
last year, where it took first. The team did make
the semifinals, but was unable to make the six-
boat final field.

Pitt’s women’s pair, without coxswain team
of Julie Lambrov and Katie Holland, was suc—
cessful, making it to the finals and placing third
in its event with time of 8:22.47. Tennessee-
Knoxville took top honors with a time of
8:03.84, and Clemson was second at 8:17.60.

Two other Panther teams made it to the finals,
and both took fifth—place finishes. They were
the women’s lightweight eight and the men’s
lightweight eight.

“The coaches were pleased with the out-
come,” McGuigan said. “[The teams] did much
better than last year — a lot of people noticed
Pitt.”

On April 22 and 23, three
members of the Wolfpitt
Powerlifting Team, which
includes current and former
Pitt students, competed in
the Drug—Free Pennsylvania
State Powerlifting
Championships which
were held in Jim Thorpe,
Pa.

In the women’s open
competition, twenty-year-
old Nicola Hill placed first
in the 129-pound weight
class. This meet was her
first taste of competitive
weightlifting.

“I was nervous, but once
you concentrate enough,
you forget everybody else,”
Hill said. “I just thought
about my technique and for-
got everybody was there.”

Hill finished the meet
with a squat of 198 pounds,
a bench press of 99 pounds
and a» personal-best 259-
pound deadlift which gave
her a three—lift total of 556.

“lt’s my best all-around
lift,” she said. “I really
enjoy it.”

After her squat and bench
lifts, Hill had lead her com-
petitor by a narrow margin,
but sealed the top spot with

second attempt.

In the men’s division, vet-
eran Steve Bianculli com-
peted in the 165-pound
class and started off strong
with an opening squat of
396 pounds. However, he
failed to negotiate any fur-
ther poundage in his subse-
quent attempts.

In the bench press, he
started with lifts of 220 and
237 pounds. On his third
lift, Bianculli was success-
ful with 242 pounds but
was disqualified on a ques-
tionable technicality.

He totalled 1,051 pounds
for the meet with deadlifts
of 407 and 418, and fin-
ished third in his class.

Also lifting in his first
competition was twenty-
two-year—old Kevin Moore,
who competed in the 242-
pound weight division.

A 562—pound squat, along
with a 451-pound press and
a 6l1—pound deadlift, pro-
pelled him to a total of
1,624 and 3/4 pounds and a
fourth—place finish out of
13.

His bench press of 451
pounds was the third high-
est of the competition.

DeBernardis, a senior, went

Five runs was more than

out. Rohrbach pitched 1 2/3
innings of shut-out ball to
pick up his fourth save.

The Panthers picked up
an additional run in the top
of the ninth to pad its lead.

Pitt’s win was even more
unlikely because it was fac-
ing the Big East Pitcher of
the Year, Mike Macone,
whose record is now low-
ered to 7-3. He allowed
five runs and eight hits in 6

Kurt Womelsdorf went 2-

first place finish in the 3,000-meter run at
9:32.85. Teammate Matt Samuel was second
with a time of 9:57.70.

In hurdles, Jonathan Dixon finished third in
the 110-meter, at 14.95. He also took fifth in
the 400-meter race with a time of 54.24.

The Panthers dominated the 400—meter hur-
dles, taking the second through fifth spots.
Wes Alexander was second with a time of
52.84, followed by Jerel Williams (53.38),
Orrel Green (53.90) and Dixon.

Pitt finished second in both relay events.
The 4x100-meter relay team, with a time of
40.90, finished behind Ohio University
(40.79). The 4x400-meter relay team finished
with a time of 3:13.56 behind Central State
University (3:ll.42).-

“The weather didn’t let us have the good
times that our efforts expressed,” said Lewis.
“The same efforts under better conditions
would’ve produced better results.”

Several Lady Panthers also had good
results despite the weather, especially in the
400—meter hurdles, where they swept the top
five spots.

Sophomore Angie Martin won the event,
with a time of 1:00.67. She was followed by

Joetta Purter (1:0l.61), Lakeya Smith
(l:03.31), Ayne Allen (1103.34) and Shanna
Fadis (l:O4.l2).

In the 100-meter dash, junior Tonya
Mullins finished fourth with a time of 12.21.
She also finished fourth in the 200-meter at
25.13.

Natasha‘ Van Reil registered a second-place
finish in the 800-meter run with time of
2:17.49, missing first-place finisher
Maryellen Long of Ashland University
(2:16.38) by just over a second.  "

Lady Panther standout Najuma Fletcher
was second in the 100-meter hurdles at
13.73. She was followed in third place by
teammate Staci Suggs, who finished with a
time of 13.97.

Both relay teams captured first place hon-
ors. The 4x100 team finished with a time of
47.59. That effort was followed up by the
4x400 team (3:43.30) smoking by CSU, who
finished second with 3:51.75.

Up next for the men and women are the
IC4A Championships, which will be held at
George Mason University.

“We did well indoors [at the IC4As], we
plan on doing so outdoors,” said Lewis.

Kemp. But Garnett can
shoot, too, unlike Kemp.
He’s the total package.

But like any high schooler,
he’s a tad immature. OK,
maybe tad isn’t the correct
word, how about extremely?
Last year alone, Garnett was
whistled for the most taunt-
ing technical fouls in Illinois
history.

Anyone who has seen him
perform in the high school
All-Star games can attest
that he’s a bit eccentric, bor-
dering on insane. He yells
like a madman, shakes his
body like he’s having severe
seizures and often throws
blows with the air.

People around the game
says he’s a real sharp kid,
but how will his adolescent
antics hold up in the NBA?

Garnett has been kicking
around the idea of the NBA
for a while. He always said
it was a serious option that
he might explore. Well, the
fact of the matter is, it’s his
only option. Unconfirmed
reports say he has not
reached the minimum SAT
scores to be eligible for col-
lege.

Garnett has said that if he
did pass the SATs he would
definitely go to college. But
his only option is to either
sit out a year or go to junior
college. Garnett doesn’t
want to do that.

It’s obvious that Garnett
isn’t concerned about an
education. However, what he
should be concerned with is
entering an entirely new
world with absolutely no
experience — not only in a
higher level of basketball,
but in life.

Oftentimes when a player
makes the jump prematurely,
they fail. When these play-
ers, who have been pam-
pered and catered to their
whole careers, fail, their
fragile egos shatter and
never recuperate. For exam-
ple, N.C. State’s Chris
Washburn. His departure
after his sophomore year was
unprecedented, and he was
selected third in the 1986
draft. But he had a couple of
bad seasons, so he turned to
drugs and has never been
heard from since. Now he’s

' known as Chris Washout.

That can happen to Garnett
if his head isn’t screwed on
straight. He has to realize
that he may not be the super-

' star he once was right from

the giddy-up. He’ll probably
need a couple years of nur-
turing and growing up before
that happens.

But make no mistakes
about it —— Kevin Garnett
has serious skills, and when
his career finally comes to a
close, he’ll have left his
mark on the NBA.

But will it be like Moses
Malone, or more like Bill
Willoughby?

Sean Duncan is the manag-
ing erlitorfor The Pitt News.
