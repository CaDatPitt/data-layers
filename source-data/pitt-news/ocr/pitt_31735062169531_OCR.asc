JACK LaPIETRA spoke before a group of disgruntled ROTC

students Friday. He was objecting to the Undergraduate Coun-

cil’s recommendation to discontinue the" granting of credits to-
_ wards graduation for ROTC courses.

J ROTC Bulletin

(Sec Iitlilorial, P(l{_{(' 4)

“On the 25th of January, 1968, a student referendum, in which
many of us voted, was held concerning ROTC and ROTC credits.

The results are as follow:

—Abolish ROTC, 132
—Make ROTC an elective, 494

—Continue ROTC with credit, 1,686

—Mandatory ROTC, 60

Percentage ‘wise, that works out to 72 per cent in favor of ROTC

credit.

And yet some of us have been unofficially informed that the Un-
dergraduate Council for the College of Arts and Sciences has voted

to take credit away from our courses.

It would then seem that SDS is currently winning in its battle to
get ROTC off campus. It would seem that 28 per cent can dictate to
the remaining 72 per cent of us. It’s about time those of us who feel
that SDS doesn’t represent us, and that the Pitt News is biased in its
presentation, and ‘that 30 bearded students or faculty members don’t
speak for the will of the student body—'it’s about time we get together
and let our feelings be known before this goes any further.

It’s time that all of us who believe in soap, deodorant and mouth-
wash unite to “cleanse and purify” the air around Oakland.”

The wholequestion of
ROTC’s presence on campus
came out into the open last Fri-
day. “The basic question,” said
Dr. Richard Rose, University
representative to the Military
Science Depa‘rtment and RTOC
coordinator, “is should credits
be given for ROTC students
.and if so, how many.” _

Dr. Rose spoke to 150 ver
disturbed ROTC students, who
had converged on the office of
University provost, Dr. Charles
Peake, concerning a recommen-
dation by the Undergraduate
Council that credits not be
granted for ROTC. '

Rose told the students that the
ROTC program was going to be
reevaluated, to see how it stands
up with other courses in content
and conduct. “The problems is,
that most people have been
evaluating the ROTC program
on a national question, the war
in Vietnam. This is incidental
and peripheral,” Rose went on,
“whether or not you agree with
the Vietnam policy is not the
question in concern with
ROTC.” -

Rose told the. students that
they were in a very good posi-
tion to challenge the recom-
mendation. “You have a right
to be heard,” he told them .
“Every student should have a
chance to voice his opinion.”
Rose told "the students that they
s h o u l d c hoose a. responsible
spokesman, and prepare a case
to be presented to the Provost
and the Chancellor, who will
make the final decisions.

One point that was brought

up concerned the general think-
ing th a t most people a r e in

  
  

  Students Confront Dr. Rose

 

ROTC because they don’t want
to take gym, and are therefore
actually forced by University
policy to go into ROTC. “What
most people don’t know,” said
one Air Force ROTC student
“is that, a large portion of all
those in Air Force ROTC are
engineers, and engineers don’t
receive any credits at all for
ROTC.” I

Dr. Rose was in favor of the
idea of reevaluating the ROTC
program. “There is nothing to
hide in the program,” he said.
“ROTC courses are open to all
interested persons. Anyone that
would like to sit in on any

ROTC class can do so,” he con- .

tinued. . .
The main reason that ROTC

being challenged. “If this area 
can ‘be challenged, why can’t  T;

most of the ROTC students.had:':?
in mind. The students said that.
they had to do as much study-: .
ing and preparation for the 
ROTC courses as for any other , 
courses in the University. Rose '
told the students that they real- 
ly didn’t have too much rea-son  
to worry about the recomir_Ien- - ' 
dation, because they have a
very strong case to present in
favor of ROTC. “It is healthy. _

RojasPresents Grape Workers Case A

by VIRGINIA JOYCE
Staff News Writer

Albert Rojas of the Grapepick-
ers of California presented “a
message for workers toiling the
grapes of wrath" at the general
meeting of the University Com-
mittee on the Racial Crisis
(UCRC>. '

“My people have no type of
protection, not from the federal
government or anybody. We have
no good warm homes and no op-
portunity for an equal education.”
stressed Rojas. a farm worker him-
self.

According to the Mexican speak-
er, migrants have been denied the
option to organize by the AFL-
CIO. Migrants and all other clas-
sifications of farm labor are not
covered by the National Labor Re-

. lations Act, he explained.

 

The petition calling for vot-
ing rights for 18 year olds will
*be available for signatures
Monday through Friday be-
tween l0 a.m. and 4 p.m. under
the clock in t_he_ CL basement.

“MY people are being manipu-
lated into slaves. yes, there are
still slaves in the United States.”
he said vehemently. “We have no
medical benefits. neither. We’re
a high tuberculosis market as a
result of the spraying machines
that don’t care if there are people
in the fields below them or not.”

The only help being offered to
the migrants comes from students
and others who are interested in
seeing a wrong righted, lamented
Rojas. “The is su e is not just
grapes.” said the grapepicker.
“The issue is one of life or death.

lIt’s life, human rights and our

kids’ lives.”

An immediate response to R0-
jas’ appeal came from James Cun-
ningham of the Sociology Depart-
ment. He proposed that the Saga
food company be instructed to
c e a s e purchase . of California
grapes. His proposal was supple-
mented by Dr. James Holland,
LRDC, who suggested that mem-
bers of the UCRC “be prepared

. to demonstrate” if Cunningham's
proposal was rejected by Saga.

“The University of Pittsburgh is ‘

' The speakers also suggested that
the University aid the education ' ii:

A series of lectures on social and
cultural unrest in contemporary society by

Dr. Richard L. Rubenstein

zm

Biblical Man and the Pursuit of the Millenium:

Biblical man was deeply moved by a vision of perfect human felicity
at the beginning and the end of history. The significance of the Biblical
conceptions of the original paradise and the final triumph of God's king-
dom willbe discussed. The impact of the biblical vision on contemporary
thought will be analyzed.

Hegel, Marx and Nietzsche—Twentieth Century Thinkers:
The impact of Hegells analyses of human encounter, alienation and the
political order on the thinking of Karl Marx and Friedrich Nietzsche will
initiate this segment of the series. Particular attention will be given to
Hegel's Early Writings, The Phenomenology and the Philosophy of R39“-
Marx’s role as social critic and revolutionary visionary will be exam-
ined. His analysis of alienated labor and the dehumanization of the
social and political realms will be evaluated as will Marx’: contributions
as a political prophet. . ' .
Nietzsche's attempt to reconstruct human values after the loss of faith
will conclude this section.

The Impact of Contemporary Technology
on the Contemporary Sensibility:

a. Medicine and the New Morality: Modern medicine has made it pos-
sible for far more people to survive than ever before in history. Modern
arms technology has made it possible for far more people to be slaugh-
tered efficiently than ever. The pill and the coil have diminished the_
age-old cohsequences of sexual relations. The impact of contemporary
medicine and biology on morality will be discussed.

b. The Communications Revolution: -Marshall Mcluhan has pointed to the
influence of the way men communicate on their apprehension of the
world. At no time in history has human communication changed as
rapidly or as drastically as in the electrotifc age. The impact of electronic
technology on contemporary sensibility will be discussed.

c. Efficiency and He|ple!sness—-Work in Contemporary Society: The pro-
liferation of vast, impersonal technological organizations in-government,
industry and education has made possible immense advances in human
productivity. It has also changed the" conditions of work so that men
no longer feel fulfilled in the segmented, impersonal functions they per-
form. The problem of work in modern society will be discussed.

The Collapse of Authority:
in religion, politics and the universities‘, establishments are in trouble.
The collapse of authority has been a revolutionary and unsettling phe-
nomenon, the final result of which has .yet to be comprehended. The
collapse of authority in America and French politics, the universities and
in both the Christian Church and the synagogue will be discussed.

Herbert Marcuse—Social Critic and
Contemporary Utopian:
Herbert Marcuse has analysed the dilemmas of human work and sexu-
ality in Eros and Civilization and One-Dimeniional Man. His writings have
had a profound effect on contemporary thought. They will be analysed
in the lectures. ' p '

The Student Revolt-
Berkeley, New York, Paris and Mexico City:

One reflection of the profoundly radical character of our times has been
the world-wide student unrest. The student unrest willbe discussed in
terms of contemporary political ideology and the revolution in the con-
temporary sensibility. Particulor attention will be devoted to the French
student revolt and its aftermath.

Revolution, Human Limitation and
Alternatives to Utopia:
Is it possible to bring about a successful revolution? What are the limi-
tations in human nature which mitigate against Utopia? Are there viable
alternatives to revolutionary utopias which do not lose sight of the
nature of min as the cruellest and most aggresive of all animals? .

M Capacity Crowd Hears Poetry

International Forum Features Berrigan  

by JUDI GALIARDI
Staff News Writer

Father Daniel Berrigan, S._J..
read his poetry to a capacity
crowd at the Carnegie Lecture
Hall last Wednesday night. He
was presented by the Internation-
al Poetry Forum, under the direc-
tion of Dr. Samuel Hazo. '

Fr. Berrigan. who is a chaplain
at Cornell University, was recent-
ly in North Vietnam to negotiate
th e release of th r e e captured
American pilots.

When asked about the pilots at
an interview with the Pitt News,
Fr. Berrigan replied. “The Amer-
ican Ambassador to Laos took the
flyers when we brought them

back and they haven’t been heard
from since.”

On Nov. 8, Father Berrigan
will be sentenced to prison for
having burned draft records with
a sort of “home-made nepalm” in
Baltimore in protest of the war.
A film of the protest was taken
by CBS and was shown at the
trial. Fr. Berrigan said, “They
wouldn’t use the sound track at
the trial. At the protest we were
saying why we burned the rec-
ords, and why we were against
the war. Later, we recited the
‘Lord's Prayer.’ The people in the
court room couldn’t hear it.”

Concerning the resistance
movement. Berrigan said. “I’m
surprised at the scope of the re-

sistance; especially with the num-
ber of students and soldiers.” Fr.
Berrigan is often referred to as the
“peace priest,” and he himself is
active with the resistance. His
brother, Fr. Phillip Berrigan, S.J.,
is now serving a six year prison
term for his anti—war demonstra-
tion. A

A Puts Issues in Perspective

Rubenstein Begins Lecture Series  A

by HARRIS MILLER
Staff News Reporter

Dr. Richard L. Rubenstein will
begin a series of lectures on so-
cial and cultural unrest -in con-
temporary society on Wednesday
at noon in G-28 CL.

The lecture series entitled “Re-
ligion and Revolution” will be-
gin with the topic “Biblical Man
and the Pursuit of Millenium."
Dr. Rubenstein told The Pitt
News, ,“The topic will relate the
Bible and man’s quest for Utopia.

While most of the past and pre-
sent writings concerning a Uto-
pia are secular. the roots of this
idea are in the Bible.” In men-
tioning that the quest for Utopia
has many times done more harm
than good. Rubenstein added.
“Marx, Hegel, and many other
20th century writers have been
influenced by the relation of the
Bible to Utopia.”

Some of Rubenstein’s future
topics will include “The Impact

substantial potential, should we base our product’

The under 25 market poses some interesting

opportunities. For one, today 142% more young
people work toward advanced college degrees than
did the youth market of 10 years ago. That would
seem to indicate a need for a new car based on
economy of purchase and operation.

But, marhet aﬂluence and the increasing number of

 lCleanse and Purify I

The Undergraduate Council of the University recom-_

 ‘mended last week that in the future no credit-be given for
f University ROTC courses. The decision was based on months

.of study by a student-faculty committee of the University Fac-
V ulty Senate. In general terms, the recommendation was
’ made because the University has no control over the curri-

culum and faculty of the ROTC program.

. The reaction "to the Undergraduate Council’s decision
has been hostile. A group of concerned ROTC students met

- ‘Friday with University Coordinator Dr. Richard Rose to air,

their gripes. Rose told them that a reevaluation of the ROTC
Would‘ be “healthy.” However, the students had different
ideas. They vowed to take some sort of action.

The group’s first course of action was to circulate a leaf-

- let at Saturday’s football game. The purpose of the leaflet
‘was to promote the cause of ROTC. But the leaflet does

quite a bit more—-it defeats the case of the ROTC students
through its distortions and explicit citations of ignorance.

The leaflet first cites the ill-fated Student Government
election referendum on ROTC. It states that '7_2 per cent of
the student body favored ROTC as it presently exists. The
leaflet fails to mention, "however, that only about 2,000 stu-
dents out of a undergraduate student population of approxi-
mately 6,500 voted in that election.

“It would seem,” says the leaflet, “that SDS is.current-

’ ly winning in its battle to get ROTC off campus.” But, the

Undergraduate Council is not SDS, and the recommendation

A does not maintain thatpROTC should be abolished.

“It’s about time those of us who feel SDS doesn’t rep-
resent us, and that the Pitt News is biased in its presentation,
and that 30 bearded students and faculty don’t speak for the
will of the student—it’s about time we get together and let our
feelings be known before this goes any further,” says the
leaflet. Can this statement be taken seriously, when the

 group who printed the "leaflet cited a referendum in which
« only one-fourth of the student body voted? Obviously this

campus conglomeration is guilty of haphazardly using statis-

. ties to beef up its case. This tactic has failed, for all the re-
_ velent statistics are available.

The most disturbing aspect of this protest was the last

 ‘ paragraph of the leaflet. “It’s time that all of us who be-
’. '  lieve in soap, deodorant, and mouthwash unite to “cleanse

andpurify’ the air around Oakland.” It was not too long ago
that George Wallace said the same thing to a group of dem-
onstrators in the Civic Arena. ' -

The leaflet circulated Saturday complies with the

I George Wallace formula of persuasion. It plays upon the
fears of the people——in this case the student body. It implies

that all those persons who want to see a reevaluation of the
ROTC programs have long hair, neglect to take baths, and

 '. fail to use mouthwash. This is complete ignorance.

This newspaper does not endorse the nationwide activ-
ity of SDS. But we are shocked and dismayed over the in-

J I ' fantile conduct and ethic of the ROTC leaflet.

, The Pitt News respects any group—of any persuasion-

that is willing to present its case or problem in a rational

and intelligent manner. The ROTC group has failed to do

this. Instead they have skirted the truth, used distorted stat-~
istics, and practiced the George Wallace tactics of persua-

sion. No student should fall prey to this highly unethical

and irrational presentation, for the leaflet represents the

summit of ignorance.

The Pitt News agrees, it is time to “‘Cleanse and purify’

 “V i the air arouifd Oakland.”

ship” was labeled obsolete and
particularly precarious by many
foreign policy experts, the Repub-

-=lican Presiden- :

tial hopeful
neverthe-
less spits out
the same old
platitudes
about h o w
great it was
during the Ei-
se,nh o w e r
(Dulles) years.

_While Dul-
les’ foreign po- 
licy left much to be desired in
the ‘50’s, the concept of “brinks-
manshipﬁ’ today is so irresponsi-
ble and tactically inept that it
could forbode the doom of man-
kind. Nonetheless, Mr. Nixon con-
tinues to shout for increases in
our defense stockpiles. He wants
to strengthen the Navy because

 

   

the Russians now have a naval
force that almost compares to
ours in quality and size. And, of
course, Mr. Nixon feels strongly
about the utmost necessity of
closing the “naval gap.”

COUPLED to Nixon’s rather
outdated and dangerous concepts
concerning the Navy is his" “wait
and see” attitude about the Nu-
clear Non-poliferation Treaty.
Here the Republican candidate
doesn’t‘ want to commit himself.
Without positive action, the
spread of nuclear weapons will
undoubtedly continue, much to
the demise of the international
situation.

In short, Mr. Nixon wants to
ingnite the flame kindling under
the arms race in a time when the
nuclear arsenals of both, the So-
viet Union and the United States
are capable of obliterating the
human race. What reason is there
to this madness? The answer is
simple: Mr. Nixon wants to re-
establish “respect” for the Unit-
ed States. But in his quest to ac-
complish this arduous task, Mr.
Nixon may cause, in the words of
Senator Joseph S. Clark, “nation—
al and international disaster.”

The thought—.or possible thought
—of international disaster is too

‘$555255 The Way I See Its

much to bear. Thus, Mr. Nixon
must be defeated at all costs. The
call for a Nixon defeat brings the
nebulous character of Hubert
Humphrey in the picture. While
Mr. Humphrey’s record over the

«past four years and his staunch

support’ for President Johnson’s
Vietnam policy is resented by stu-

dents, his upset election is essen- _

tial if the United States is to
maintain its international sanity.

MR. HUMPHREY once told
this writer of the possibilities of
a Vietnam peace. At that time his
candidacy was more than disap-
pointing. But as time goes by.
and as the voters are getting a
tiny glimpse at the “real Nixon,”
the election of the Vice-President
becomes paramount.

In eight days we will know our
fate. Our choice is to go back to

the “Eisenhower malaise” or to '

forge ahead — slowly but surely

— with the Humphrey program. ,

Our choice is an important one —
one that may break the very back-
bone of this nation. Our’s to rea-
son why; "ours is not to do and

die. If we do reason “why,” we
will go to the polls Nov. vote for

ocrativ victory. -

 many times as those guyshave been

by DAVE TIE RNAN
Staff News Editor

The varsity football team lost again this week-
end; both soccer teams lost this weekend; the fresh-
man football team beat West Virginia this week-
end; and Jerry Richey and company won another
cross—country meet. Two wins. three losses: that’s
not bad. -

4 But a closer look at the overall record for this
year’.s athletic teams, which is
ten wins and 13 loses, shows that
the winners keep winning and
the losers keep losing.

In reviewing the athletic pro-
gram at the University, the same =
pattern prevails. The athletic pro-
gram here is stagnant.

MANY solutions have been of-
fered to improve the situation.
Athletic Director Frank Carver 
has often been pointed out as the 
master mind behind the dilemma. ,
Various coaches, such as Bob Tim-
mons. Leo Bemis and now, Dave Hart, have been
pointed to as the‘ cause of the deplorable situation.
Recruiting (or lack of). money, scholarships and
many other reasons have entered the minds of stu-
dents when the problem is discussed.

Why does the present situation exist? How can
it be changed? Who’s fault is it? These are all
questions asked by students every day, especially
after a weekend such as this one, when for the
fifth time this year the students were humiliated
by their University’s athletic program.

Lack of student support was the main cry last
year. It was supposed by many that an enthusiastic
student body could psyche the teams into a win-
ning pattern. But as was evident at Saturday’s
game. the cheering and support that was very ap-
parent at the first two home games is now gone.
Those students who were brainwashed by the pre-
season buildup are now accepting reality.

THE STUDENTS in the stands Saturday were
critical of coach Dave Hart; they were critical of
many of the players. But between the lines of their
humorous quips of disgust many solutions to the
situation were proposed. A

“They should have the finish of the cross-coun-
try meets in the stadium,” one student suggested.
‘-‘It would give us something.to cheer about during
these boring minutes.”

‘‘I wouldn’t mind if we lost by 50 points,” one

   

. fan noted, “If they’d just use their heads. [My fra-

ternity team hasn’t‘been offsidein four years as
today.”,.g_ I

 

 

Students Offer Some Suggestions
 To Dilemma Of Athletic Program...

  

“YOU THINK this is bad,” a guy answered.
“You should have seen the soccer game yesterday.
I was so disgusted that I left after the first half.
You talk about disorganization. You’d have thought
they were a pick-up team playing together for the
first time.” ,

One coed was telling her date that she heard
from a friend that the soccer team lost because
coach Bemis initiated a new offensive formation’
15 minutes before the game began, and West Vir-
ginia scored three goals before the players ad-
justed.

An alumnus in the stands hailed his friend With
“I see they’re still using the same old pass pat-
terns.” Another student was explaining to a friend
that the freshmen have beaten West Virginia for
three straight years, but lost two in a row as var-
sity players. “Both teams have the same players;
we must be out-coached,” he said. ‘

ANOTHER FAN was discussing recruiting with
his buddy during. halftime. “If Hart out-recruited

the other schools around here, why do they im- ‘

prove while we continue to lose? What does he do
with the talent?”

One fan stuck up for the program here. He sug-
gested that coach Jim Banner, who has done an ex-
ceptional job in recruiting and coaching the cross-
country and track teams, be made Athletic Direc-
tor and head coach of all the teams. That comment
received‘ many laughts, but one fan explained that
possible reasoning behind it.

“I live in the dorms, and I know a lot of play-
ers on'all the teams,” he explained. “The thing
that makes Banner a winner is the fact that the
players he coaches respect him. He works them
hard, but they know why. He instills spirit in them.
The players on the other teams here like their
coaches as people, but don’t respect them as coach-
es.” .

IN RESPONSE to this statement, many names
such as Joe Paterno, Bear Bryant, and Vince Lom-
bardi entered into the conversations as examples
of coaches that demand respect at all costs, and
produce winners as a result. Then the clincher
came from-a bearded student.

“Pitt couldn’t pay Paterno’s laundry bill. Do
you know how much they pay Hart? Why for that
money, if I were Hart, I’d quit and write a book
called “Paper Panther.” If he weren’t so dedi-
cated, he’d have quit last year.”

But the hands of the students are tied, just as
the purse strings of the athletic department are
tied. What can the students do to improve the situa-
tion? «They care; theywantrimprovement; but what

theyd? — V‘ ' “‘

Grad Student Raps Karlins’s
Analysis of Educational Dilemma

Editor, The Pitt News:

I found Mr. Karlins’ advice for
improving college teaching some-
what informative but basically
evasive regarding the qualities of
a good teacher and an outstand-
ing course. His first suggestion
to improve ,teaching is to “im-
prove the pay-off for teaching ex-
cellence,” i.e.. salary hikes, job

advancement, and public recog-

nition.

In response to this suggestion I
must remind Mr. Karlins that
some of my finest high school
teachers, amazingly enough, had
M.A. and Ph.D. degrees. Money
is not necessarily the means to
motivate the teacher to teach bet-
ter.

His second suggestion involved
a form of “course bargaining,”
which I criticize not for its intrin-
sic value, but for its limited ap-
plicability. Teacher-student co-
operation in deciding on the texts
and structure of a course is an ad-
mirable and ideal situation that
would demand critical and crea-
tive approaches but also a small

number of people! Mr". Karlins‘

forgets that in a lecture class of
50 or more. chaos. and not coop-
eration, is bound to ensue if such
bargaining and compromising

goes on with the students.

I suggest that teachers improve
their teaching and become better
motivated to excel in teaching by
remembering their truly awe-
some power of moulding young
minds and their initial responsi-
bility to guide the student. Work-
ing from these premises, a teach-
er will: I

1. Present, at the beginning of a
course, an outline that gives an
over-view of the material. along
with long-range and short-term
goals clearly defined.

2. During his lectures continual-
ly relate his material to gener-

al concepts to be studied and
show thecontinuity of ideas.

Moreover, a teacher must real-
ize that he is a speaker, not a tape
recorder. Presentation of lectures
needs organization and coheren-
cy, as suggested previously, but a
lecture also needs some drama.
Why don’t college teachers have
to take instruction in speaking.
just as high school teachers do in
order to get licenses that qualify
them to teach more than one stu-
dent? This is not a plea for fiery
orations; it is a plea for enthusi-
astic and audible speaking.

In concludion. I believe that
the teacher must be intellectual-
ly honest and realistic-with him-
self about the characteristics of
his students. Most students have
a vigorous course load and can-
not be expected to organize a
course by researching in the li-
brary in order to fill in the gaps
the lecturer expected his students
to know or discover on his own. I
insist that a teacher guide and
help structure his students’ fog-
gy and disjointed ideas about new
material. '

A student who in u st spend
hours “un-confusing” himself in
the library, to fit together the un-
related pieces that his teacher was
too lazy to do in class or too con-
fident that the student could un-
derstand independently, is a frus-
trated, not a well-"motivated stu-
dent. Are teachers, in all honesty,
thinking an d acting logically
when they themselves demons-
trate no such qualities? Mr. Kar-
lins’ teachers may need money
to motivate them, but once mo-
tivated we students would deeply
appreciate their asking them —
selves, “Why am I teaching, and
why should these students listen
to me?”

ROTC Protesters
Hit “Story” .

Editor, The Pitt News:
We are writing in regard to the

' article that appeared in Wednes-

day’s Pitt News “ROTC Credit
Protest ‘Cut.”’ We would like to
point out that ROTC is a course
of study at this University as are
history or chemistry courses. Fur-
thermore. the Tuesday sessions at
Forbes Field are regularly sched-
uled University c l a s se s. Th e
point. therefore, is that a group
of “about 30 members” invaded
and attempted to disrupt that
class.

The issue is whether or not a
group —— of any compositionr— has
the right to.interfere with a sched-
uled class. If this right is
granted, then where is the line to
be drawn? If an ROTC class can
be disrupted, would it not then
be legal to disrupt a religion or
philosophy class which teaches

views contrary to one’s own; or 4

for that matter, should any course
be subject to such an invasion?

We cannot see how the disrup-
tion of any class can be justified.
After all. we, too, are at the Uni-
versity to learn. If some students
choose to enroll in ROTC, that is
their privilege. How can these
people justify themselves in hin-
dering the education of others"?

Student protests have hindered
the education process in a num-
ber of universities. We do not
want to see a similar precedent
set here at Pitt.

2 Panther Offensive Penalities Spoil

 For about two hours Saturday afternoon, the Panthers and
the Air Force Falcons held a give-away day, with the prize be-
ing a victory. In the end, the Panthers proved to be more generous and

handed the Falcons a 27-14 win.

they should have won. The Pan-
thers had 13 penalties, which to-

ders from getting out of the num-

selves in.

On two kick-offs and two punt
returns, the Panthers were caught
clipping, many of these occurring
after the play had passed the of-
fender by. This cost the gridders
60 yards of valuable field posi-
tion and caused them to take the
ball deep in their own territory.

Moss Dominates Offense

by BILL NAAB

MORGANTOWN, W. Va. — The Panther
Cubs finally got the feel of confronting an op-
ponent. The stuffed their first victory in the hop-
per, 7-6, against the West Virginia Mountaineer
frosh here Friday. V

Coach Carl Kokor stated, “Our squad got a bet-
ter feel as a football team today. This was our first
game, but we were close-knit all‘ along. Our close-
ness kept us together through the rough spots. A
team, not an individual. stops an important goal-
line stand.”

The Cubs crashed the Mountaineer defense for
their only score of the day late in the first quarter.
After a short West Virginia punt to the Little Moun-
taineer 32, backs Lou Julian and John Moss took
seven cracks at the West Virginia line before fin-
ally scoring. Moss. the outstanding player of the
game, dove over f‘ )m the one. and Andy Mollura
converted for the seventh point.

West passed 24 yards to Scott Hindsley for the
only Little Mountaineer score. Hi_ndsley was wide

si slipped. However, Embessi tipped the all-impor-

tant two point conversion pass away from Hindsley
-and out of the end zone. The score came midway
, in the fourth period.

Kokor remarked that the team matured. They
had been tested in a back and forth game. “The
game was never out of question. Every play was
1mportant.” said Kokor.

In addition. the partially injured Cub players
happened ‘to be his chief ‘concern. He indicated that

THE BEGlNNING_OF THE END. Three interceptions late in the

fourth quarter killed any chance of the Panthers overtaking the Fal-

cons. Cyd Maattala (47) swiped the third to ice the 27-14 win. Joe Mc-
Cain (left) and Geroge Medich (85) made the tackle.

open on the play, after defensive back Tom Embes-.

had to punt two plays later.

Standing barefoot on a soiled
rug outside the coaches’ locker
room, a pale and visibly shaken
Dave Hart tried to explain his
team’s performance. “This just
shouldn’t be happening,” he said.
“We constantly beat ourselves.
We’d make a 20 yard gain and
lose it with a five yard penalty.

“The boys made mistakes and
they went crazy,” he continued.
“They have to search beyond
themselves, somewhere not on this
earth. I just don’t know where.

particular. He had been injured for two or three
weeks and had little preparation.

However, Kokor could not praise the Cubs’ of-
fense. Neither quarterback, Joe DeLisioA nor Lou
Angello, completed a'pass all during the 12-min-
ute-per-quarter game. All of the 122 yard total of-‘
fense was rushing, led by 27 carries by Moss for
119 yards. Kokor explained that he planned to go
primarily with his running attack, since he believes
that the rushing is more consistent at this stage of
development. He stated, “Our passing will be more
consistent as the year progresses.” ‘

Standout Moss amazed everyone in attendance.
offensively and defensively. Kokor cited one play
in particular. On a screen pass. Moss was left all
alone to stop the play. He brushed the blackers
aside. and stopped the ball carrier for a short gain.
On offense, Kokor stated. “Moss went wild. Two or
three times. he had no business gaining any yard-
age. Yet. he kept plowing over would-be tacklers.”

Assistant coach John Rosenberg explained the
confusion concerning West Virginia’s attempt for
the game-winning extra point. “It was like chang-
ing pinch hitters and relief pitchers in a baseball
game." Rosenberg related. “They took their kick-
ing team off the field. Then we set up a 4-3 pass
defense. vulnerable to the off tackle run.

“We called our players back. and looped out our
tackles to protect against the off-tackle run. And in
the first place. we had a goal line defense.” he
added. “I was just praying. A quarterback sneak
definitely would have killed us. But. they‘hadn’t
run up the middle all day. so why would they at
that time?” It was gamble that worked.

ALL-EAST CANDIDATE and pro prospect Harry -“Skip” Orszulak

(80) makes a leaping grab against Phil Bauman‘ (33). It was one of

ten Orszulak hauled in for 145 yards, one reception short of Bob Lon-
go’s 1966 record against UCLA.

“When the Air Force defense
shifted and jitterbugged, our of-
fense panicked and moved. This
is something that they should have
been used to and it shouldn’t have
upset them.”

In the winning locker room
above, the din of excited voices,
a happy Ben Martin explained
how he almost gave the game
away. With his team leading 20-
14 in the beginning of the fourth
quarter, the Falcons tried to score
a touchdown on a fourth down and
goal play, instead of trying for a
field goal.

“I blew the fourth down play,”
he said. “I thought that the ball
was on the one foot line instead of
the two-yard line. If I had known
it was on the’ two, I definitely
would -have gone‘ for the field
goal.” ’

Martin was impressed with the
Panther squad, especially the
work of the defense and their new
formations. “They were quick and
gave strong pursuit. They blitzed
an awful lot. We had to shut-off
two-thirds of our blocking pat-
terns.”

Hart/was also impressed and

- pleased with his defense’s perfor-

mance. “It was a new defense,
with a five man front, and they
played it well. except for a cou-
ple of lapses,” he stated.

THE FRESHMAN defense coupled

day. Here,_ Willie Saloky (43) with

Hart signaled out the perform-
ances of linebacker Jeff Brown,
tackle John Stevens and defensive
back Dave Dibbley against the
Falcons.

Offensively, the main threats
of the Panthers, Havem, Ferris,
and Skip Orszulak, continued to
have strong performances. Ferris,

for the second time this season, '

gained over 100 yards on the
ground. He carried 26 times for
112 yards and one touchdown, a

flying leap from the one yard _

line.

Havern passed 20 of 36 for 246
yards. but had three interceptions.
These came in the fourth quarter
when the Panthers were still in
contention, but Havern couldn’t
deliver the ball after injuring his
ankle and suffering a numbing in-
jury to his throwing arm. . ‘

Orszulak collared 10 of Hav-
ern’s tosses for 145 yards and one
touchdown, his fourth of the sea-
son. Orszulak’s longest gain came
on a pass and run play which cov-
ered 54 yards from the Pitt‘ one
foot line.

With their fifth defeat behind
them and four strong foes yet to
come, coach Dave Hart, his staff,
and his players must find the se-
cret that will keep them from
beating themselves.

WVU Makes Booters “Scramble,
Grabs Sixth Consecutive Triump 

by ED CONLEY

Coach Leo Bemis’ soccer-
men found the first quarter a
bit too slippery Friday, as they
lost to the West Virginia Mount-
aineers 3-0, in the rain at For-

That first period was the one
that killed the booters. A quick
goal, scored after less than a min-
ute of play, was. banged in by
WVU’s right wing, Terry Par-

Not too long after that, Jim
Frazee scored, and then Len Fors-

most stride for stride. Canada had some good boys,” said Banner.

He also indicated that two previously injured runners, Mark Vorn-
hagen and Greg Rodgers, have been constantly improving. Banner
stated, “Mark is coming around and will be ready for Penn State.
Rodgers’ foot is now much better than it had been.”

Banner indicated that his squad is climbing"’.upward /every week.
He explained that “the boys had one bad week. The midterms and in-

juries didn’t help any at the time.

“They’re proud of what they’ve done,” he added,‘ “and they want
to keep it that way. They’re a great bunch of you__ng men. This was our -

third flat meet of the season, and 0

that first Buffalo meet.”

The coach additionally commented that when the season began,
the squad’s aim was to do the best they could in every meet in which
they entered. Banner said, “They’ve never lost sight of their goals.

. They want to win. That’s the big thing.” ‘

The freshmen harriers finished third in the top-rate frosh com-
petition. Bob Hagner, returning from a back injury, finished fourth.
Neil Sapienza, who Banner credited with a great performance, came
in 11th. Ken Balky, Dave Cobb, and Fred Rossman ran 13th, 15th,

and 22nd respectively.

“Rossman ran real good,” said Banner. “It was the best race of his
career, and he hasn’t had much experience.” Banner remarked that he
believes that Dave Cobb can run much better, and that Bob Hagner
will improve tremendously with more conditioning. The coach is now
anticipating the harriers’ toughest meet thus far—Penn State.

Frosh Play CMU, ,
Kickers Defeated, 2- 1

by MARTIN HELLMAN

The freshman soccer team’s shooting’ was as cold as the’
weather on Saturday morning. Although they outshot Carnegie-
Mel1on’s squad 33-8, they could only manage one goal, in suf-
fering their second loss of the season, 2-1. 1

The coaching duel between ex-teammates Pete Snyder and»Joe
Kruth started out as a defensive battle in the first quarter. Only six
shots were taken as both teams could not mount a sustained attack.

However, the Frosh began to
move in the second period. They
controlled the action and outshot

the Tartans 13-1. Unfortunately, ’

Tom Jones, the kicker’s fullback,
accidentally knocked the ball into

. the goal as he tried to clear it out

of the area. This fulke score gave
CMU~a 1-0 margin at halftime.

After only a minute gone in the
third, stanza, CMU scored its sec-
ond goal. Henrik Palme got pos-
session of the ball in the frosh’s
right corner. He lofted it to Luis
Rossanes who headed it by goalie
John Giorgio. This was one of the
very few times that the booters
tight defense broke down.

The kickers had several good
opportunities in the third quarter
to score. but they could not break

through. Two handballs by CMU 95-25. yethave managed only one i
gave, the freshmen ‘two indlrectv '

free kicks in the goal area, but_the
Tartans held frm.

In the final period, the frosh
almost completely demonstra-
ted the action. The goalie had to

stop 10 shots sent at him by the
booters. The Tartans received an-
otherbig break when a shot was
blocked by the hands of one of their
fullbacks, and the referree did not
see it.

Finally, with fifty seconds to go
in the contest, the kickers scor-
ed. Tony Nicholapoulos was award-
ed a penalty shot due to a violation
by the Tartans. Tony converted
the shot for his third goal in the
three games played this season. i

_ The booters inability to score

their first three games, they have

tion and have outshot their’ opponents

score of a football game.

“We went ahead 2-0 just‘be-

analyzed Hawk coach Roy “Jump-

ed our whole strategy.”

The Hawks, who haven’t played
since last year’s winning exhibi-
tion game against the hapless
Steelers, were pacing themselves
throughout the first half.

“We were going to play hard
in the second half,” admitted
“Jumpshot,” “but when ‘Bubba’
(‘Art Rosengarten) forced that idiot
on the other ‘team to run behind
his own end zone for an’ easy safe-
ty, we couldn’t stop laughing.

The Hawks laughed so hard
during half-time that they didn-’t
get a chance to rest.
