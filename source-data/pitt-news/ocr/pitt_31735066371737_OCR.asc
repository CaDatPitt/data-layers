Judicial Board

hearing scheduled

Mark A. Sindler
The Pitt News

After three previous postpone-
ments, a judicial board hearing for
Craig Heyward is tentatively sched-
uled for Feb. 27. The freshman run-
ning back for the Panthers was
dismissed from Tower A after
allegedly attacking two students
with a crutch during the early hours
of Jan. 22.

A charge of aggravated assault
was dropped by city magistrate Wal-
ter Little, but Heyward may stand
trial on one count of simple assault.
Heyward, a highly-recruited tail-
back from Passaic, N.J., could also
face dismissal from Pitt — the stif-
fest penalty the board can
administer.

Sophomore Matthew Black

reportedly sustained extensive facial

injuries, and freshman Stephan
Hastings suffered a broken shoulder
blade after Heyward allegedly
assaulted the two. The incident
transpired on the fifth floor after
Ezekial Gadson, Heyward's room-
mate who is also a freshman tail-
back, scuffled with Heyward over
the volume level of a stereo.

Both Black and Heyward are
being represented by third-year Pitt
law school students Allan
Sodomsky and Phil Fabiano.
Though Fabiano could not be
reached by The Pitt News last night,
Black contended that the hearing
process has stagnated.

“I'm just concerned about the way
the whole judicial process is going,”
Black said yesterday. “There just
seems to be too much sidestepping."

The "initial hearing was set for

Feb. 8 but was set back since

Sodomsky was appointed Hey-

ward’s representative several days

Governor pitches GM

PITTSBURGH (UPI) —— Dick
Thornburgh said his pitch to sell his
state as the site for the new Saturn
auto plant was well received yester-
day by executives of Saturn and
General Motors.

Thornburgh, accompanied by Lt.
Gov. William Scranton, met for
about an hour and a half yesterday
morning in a Detroit’ suburb with
representatives of Saturn, GM and
the United Auto Workers.

Saturn, the newly created division
of GM, is seeking a location for its
first plant. It is expected to employ
6,000 workers and produce 500,000
compact cars by the end of the
decade.

Following the closed-door meet:
ing yesterday, Thornburgh told
reporters that “we were very well
received; we look forward to future
discussions.”

The Republican governor said his
sales presentation focused on the
long-term business climate in Penn-
sylvania and did not include any
monetary incentives specifically
designed to lure the auto plant to his
state. ’

Thornburgh said his pitch also
included a list of 37 possible sites for
the Saturn plant, including a pro-
posed location that straddles the
Pennsylvania-Ohio border near
Erie, Pa.

Shadyside rapes prompt Angel patrol

By Nadia Moritz
The Pitt News

The city police are investigating
the rapes of three women and
attempted rape of another that
occurred in Shadyside over the last
month. In response to these inci-
dents, the Guardian Angels have
also started patrols in the area.

The most recent rape occured last
Tuesday morning on Holden Street,
when a 21-year-old woman was
abducted in her own car, driven to
an unidentified location, assaulted
and then dropped off near her house
before her assailant burned the car,
police said.

According to Sgt. Ray Mick-
nowski, head of the sex assault
squad, the first rape occurred Jan.

Pitt students celebrate February as Black

I2. The most recent incident was last
Thursday morning at l2:30 when a
19-year-old woman was accosted
near the intersection of North
Neville and Bayard Streets.
Although the reported attackers
were all reported as black males,
between 5-10 and 6-0 andbetween
I60 and 200 lbs., a spokesman ofthe
sex assault squad said that the inci-
dents are unrelated and so far in the
investigation, there are no suspects.
According to inspector Herman
Mitchell of the Shadyside police, all
possible safety precautions are being
implemented and the department is
hoping to solve the crisis soon.
“Every available man and woman
that we could possibly have out
there is in the area,” said Mitchell.
The Pittsburgh Guardian Angels
have also begun safety precautions
by concentrating their time and
efforts for the first time in the

Shadyside area. The group of self-
appointed peacekeepers moved into
Shadyside this weekend with l I p.m.
to I I a.m. foot patrol Thursday, Fri-
day and Saturday nights. “We’re try-
ing to saturate that area this
weekend, and spread an awareness
that the group will be patrolling in
the area’,” said the chapter’s leader,
Paul Martinelli.

The Angels usually patrol in
groups of seven, armed with nothing
more lethal than a whistle, and use
martial arts to apprehend any crimi-
nal suspects they uncover. Presently
they patrol in the downtown, South-
side and Oakland areas, Shadyside
is the most recent addition to the list.
The Angels will be zoning the area
this week, locating problem spots,
and then will begin regular patrols.

According to inspector Mitchell,
the Shadyside police have been
receptive to the additional help. “I

have no problems with the Angels,’
said Mitchell. “They diﬁnitely have
a right to be there and as long as t_hey
don’t interfere with our
police...fine.”

According to Martinelli, the reac-
tions ofthe neighborhoods have also
been encouraging. “We couldn’t ask
for more support than what we’re
getting in Shadyside. We can’t even
walk down Walnut Street without
being stopped I0 times to shake peo-
ple’s' hands,” said Martinelli. ‘-‘You
can tell the need by the reaction of
the people. They must feel that there
is a need for the Guardian Angels
and they are glad that help is on the
way.”

The prospective Guardian Angels
chapter at the University of Pitts-
burgh has not been receiving to same
support. Since recruiting began in
November, the chapter has been sta-
ble at I I members. They have begun

training, planning and even patrols,
but the support of the campus police
or even of the students has not
improved since November.

“We’re not going out of our way
to harass the Angels,” said Asst.
Director of Public Safety Jim
Waters, “but we can’t sanction them
for liability reasons. They _can do
whatever they want as long as they
are on the public streets.”

And on the public streets is where
the chapter has remained. The group
has attempted to hold meetings and
training in different unused parts of
Forbes quad, but their meetings
have been interrupted and dispersed
by the campus police.

“I cannot understand the lack of
cooperation from the university
police," said freshman Cathy
Modaro. “We are giving up ourtime
and energy so we can do something

Pitt students celebrate Black History Month

“If you are trying to become a
successful minority and become suc-
cessful at being a minority, you are
already a failure,” Tony Brown said
last Friday on a visit at Pitt as part of
a Black History Month lecture ser-
ies. Brown stressed that, to become
successful in a white-dominated
economy, blacks must rely on their
Own resources within the black
community.

Brown, host and producer of
“Tony Brown’s J Ournal,”the longest
running syndicated black affairs ser-

ies on television, said that “heritage,

and the direct contact with your cul-

that America is a “diverse, pluralis-
tic society,” and therefore particular
ethnic groups which remain cohe-
sive are the ones which ultimately
are powerful. They will retain that
dominant position as long as they
react within their Own structure to
succeed. “This," Brown said, “is the
case in white America.”

Blacks must assure that they use
their income to support black busi-
nesses and use their political clout in
their self interests, Brown said.
“Blacks must stop looking to whites
for answers but help themselves as
other ethnic groups do. Govern-
ments and societies are impersonal;
they react only to power blocs in

Brown explained, does not have a
direct relationship to its past. It
attempts to deny its past or is
attempting to evade its own culture.
Such is the case, according to
Brown, with African Americans.

“If you do not understand your
past," he said, “you are certainly not
effective in the present and you are
incapable of going into the future.
You can’t live in a culturally diverse
society where other cultures rely on
themselves. You can’t compete with
these people.

“We are almost consumed with
proving we do not dislike white peo-
ple,” Brown ' continued, “because
America has established a Catch 22
for blacks. If you are pro-black, you
are told you are anti-white.” Brown
went on to s_ay that many blacks
have become anti-black to prove
they are not anti-white.

were concluded successfully. The
treaty eliminated U.S., British,
French and Soviet troops from Aus-
tria, re-establishing it as an inde-
pendent and neutral state. .
Kreisky heralded the treaty as the
end of the cold war — which, he
said, began with the Potsdam Con-
ference —- and the beginning Of an

' era of detente. He also said the 1975

Helsinki Conference was a “spectac-
ular confirmation” Of detente.

But the era of detente is over,
according to Kreisky, and we are
now experiencing what he termed
“cold peace.”

“Detente is an important policy,’
Kreisky said, “good for both the
East and the West. Liberalization of
communist countries can only
happen with a policy of detente.”

Kreisky said the arms negotia-
tions scheduled for next month
between the United States and the
Soviet Union must end in “substan-
tial results.”

“White people really don’t have
any role in our freedom. They don’t
have any role in.our oppression; we
only think they do. They’re not
thinking about us. We have to free
ourselves from the preoccupation.
The Africans have a beautiful pro-
verb for that: lt’s not what you call
me, it's what I answer to! We have to
get this straight, and the only way to
get that straight is if we get our roots
straight.”

Brown said that if a person is
named a minority, he will ultimately
seek a minority status. “A numerical
minority is 49 percent of l00. Your
place is not 49 percent of 100; your
place is anywhere you want it to be.
Your place is dependent on your
vision.” 2

Describing the 50-year pattern of
Amos and Andy-type characters of
television, Brown said that Amos

and Andy are examples of“shufﬂing
darkies trying to figure out how to
cheat white people. They are the fig-
ures Of black» professional
incompetence.

“You saw them last Tuesday-on
the alleged ‘Atlanta Murders’ ”
Brown said. “It was the murder of
black America.”

According to Brown, the TV pro-
gram was a complete distortion of
facts that “assassinated black peo-
ple.” In Brown’s opinion, the
Atlanta murders portrayed May-
nard Jackson, the former mayor of
Atlanta, as an incompetent.

“You see, it wasn’t about Atlanta
at all,” Brown said. “It was about
any institution where black people
have become political leaders. The
warning was that services will deteri-
orate because blacks are obsessed
with getting back at white people.”

global detente

“It makes no sense to talk of iso-
lated nuclear war,” he said, “when
there could never be a limited
nuclear war.”

Kreisky also spoke optimistically
of negotiations begun yesterday
between the U.S. and the Soviet
Union concerning the Middle East.

“The Middle East is the most dan-
gerous problent facing the world
today,” he said. He feared that esca-
lation of hostilities in Lebanon
could someday involve the two
superpowers in armed conﬂict, since
the U.S. supports Israel and the
Soviets back Syria.

Besides U.S.-Soviet relations,
Kreisky addressed two serious prob-
lems facing the world today: high
unemployment in western democra-

' cies and the growing debt in Third

World countries.

“Today, we have in the demo-
cratic countries 30 million unem-
ployed people,” he said. “This is a

ize democratic countries. We must

According to Kreisky, Third
World countries find it difficult to
compete in world markets because
they are not industrialized.

“It makes no sense for a country
like Mozambique to have all this
coal and not be able to transport it,"
he said. “We have to change our atti-
tudes toward the Third World.”

He suggested the implementation
of a type of Marshall Plan to “build
up the infrastructure” of Third
World countries. Kreisky said Aus-
tria would not exist as a country
today without the Marshall Plan.
Without help from the industrial-
ized countries, the Third World
“cannot pay Off their debts today or
even in the near future.”

Kreisky ended his remarks by say-
ing that “without peace, all our
efforts will be in vain.”

Pitt sees
rise in
applicants

By Susan Benedek
The Pitt News ‘

The University of Pittsburgh is
receiving many more applica-
tions for prospective students
than last year at this time,
according to Kevin Altomari,
associate director ofthe Office of
Financial Aid. A

Last year Pitt received 5,540
applications by the middle of
February but this year the
number has increased to 5,943,
Altomari said.

“The national average SAT
scores for college-bound seniors
is 950, math and verbal com-
bined. Here at Pitt, the incoming
freshman’s scores averages
1,050,” stated Altomari.

A recent New York Times arti-
clereported that students are
achieving slightly higher scores
on the SAT than in the past.
Much of the increase is attrib-
uted to the use of computers and
better preparation for SATs.

Also, more prospective Pitt
students are applying for busi-
ness, engineering and computer
science programs, according to
Altomari.

“But this has been a trend and
does not deviate from last years’
freshman.”

The deadline for applications

_is March 1, I985.

Implants
Mechanical

Donald Denny, director of organ
procurement for the hospitals of the
University Health Center, com-
mented on mechanical heart
implants during a telephone inter-
view yesterday after Murray Hay-
don underwent the third such
operation.

“These are clinical trials of a
potentially valuable device [in the
future],” he said. “The desire to pro-
long the life of a patient is a goal, but

Haydon, a 58-year-old man from
Louisville, l(y., received his
mechanical heart in a three—hour
operation on Sunday. Reports on
his condition show that Haydon is
recovering 24 to 36 hours ahead of
the pace set by the second recipient
of an artificial heart, William
Schroeder. Dr. Allan Lansing,
spokesman for the Humana Hospi-
tal, was quoted in the New York
Times as saying, “Mr. Haydon’s
condition is so good it is
frightening.”

Meanwhile, Schroeder is suffer-

cause. According to Lansing, the
chances of Schroeder being able to
leave the hospital and live a normal
life are slim.

In his remarks, Denny said that
both the doctors and the patients
realize that the mechanical heart
implant is still experimental. The
technique has not yet been per-
fected, and the chances for success
are understandably slim.

Denny said that since the heart
functions like a pump, artificial
hearts are relatively simple to manu-

cal kidneys and livers will become
commonplace.

“Organs like kidneys and livers
have so many complex functions,”
he said. “I don't think we’ll see, in
our lifetime, artificial kidneys and
livers that take over all functions of
the human organs." He does predict,
however, that the use of mechanical
hearts will spread after the device
and the implantation are perfected.

According to Denny, the surgical
technique will eventually come to
the hospitals of the University
Health Center. “In time, the medical
scientists who develop the mechani-
cal heart will do it to a point where it
can have therapeutic use for major
university centers." '

No Second Chances

In his radio address last Saturday, President Reagan said that the
United States should support the Nicaraguan Contra rebels; much
like France supported American Patriots against the British in our
Revolutionary War. If not for French help, said Reagan, our nation
might not have been born.

This is perverse logic when applied to the situation in Nicaragua. By
supporting the Contras, or Somocistas, the U.S. is not supporting
freedom ﬁghters but attempting to reinstitute the despotic and totali-
tarian Somoza regime that the U.S. forced on Nicaragua in the 1930s
and supported until its bitter end.

The freedom fighters the United States should have supported are
now in power in Nicaragua. Stubbornly propping up the corrupt
Somoza regime alienated the Sandinistas and drove them into the
arms of the Soviets and Cuba. The U.S. lost the initiative and is now
faced with a hostile and growing military threat to the south.

U.S. support of Somocista terrorists defeats its own purpose. It
only serves to rally the Nicaraguan people behind the Marxist Sandi-
nista banner while undermining U.S. credibility abroad. If, the Rea-
gan administration truly “supports the struggle for democracy in
Central America," as Mr. Reagan said in his address, why then does he
support military dictatorships in Guatemala and Honduras? There is
an inherent hipocrisy in the Reagan adminstration’s foreign policy —
a despot is not a despotif he opposes communism.

The latest example of this hipocrisy is seen in his policy towards the
Philippines. Mr. Reagan says the U.S. must support dictator Ferdi-
nand Marcos lest the communists take over. This is blatant nonsense.
The people of the Phillipines have had a long relationship with the
United States and greatly admire American democracy. This is why
they feel especially betrayed by our country as it continues to support
Marcos in spite of overwhelming evidence that he may be responsible
for the assassination of opposition leader Benigno Aquino.

The terrible hotel fire last week in Manilla, which claimed more
than two dozen lives, was set “to protest against the U.S.-Japan
support of the Marcos dictatorship,” according to a note sent to news
agencies by a terrorist group claiming responsibility for the fire. The
fire was not set by communists (they disavowed “such dastardly
tactics”). Perhaps the arsonists felt compelled to resort to terrorism to
combat terrorism in the form of Ferdinand Marcos.

Now is the time to support the opposition trying to undo the
Marcos dicatorship and reinstate democracy in the Phillipines. To
continue to support Marcos would be self-fulfilling prophecy; it
would serve only to enhance the position of the communists. The
Filipinos want democracy, not communism, but if the U.S. continues
to support a dictatorship, they may see communism as their only
recourse.

One need only look to history for support of this argument. U.S.
support ofthe dictator Batista spawned Castro in Cuba, the Shah fell
to Khomeini in Iran (not communist, but perhaps worse) and Somoza
gave way to the Sandinistas in Nicaragua. All these failures of Ameri-
can foreign policy could have been averted if the U.S. had recognized
the needs of the people of those countries.

Apparently Mr. Reagan cannot accept the failure of this policy of
“keeping the world safe for democracy” by means of fascism. Faced
with this failure in Nicaragua, he asks us to support terrorists to fight
what he calls a Marxist government. It is too late to change events in
Nicaragua, and certainly funding terrorists is the wrong means to that
end. Let us learn from our mistakes in Nicaragua, and not repeat them
in the Philippines.

Liberal Triumph

Why is it that when conservatives
want to eliminate waste in the
government budget, they start talk-
ing about the mistakes of liberalism?
Both liberals and conservatives want
to eliminate waste in government.
The question is: Where’s the waste?

Kevin Bold’s letter of Feb. 13
(“Liberal Error”) says that we don’t
realize that in a free society govern-
ment has only three functions:
defense, police, and having law
courts. The rest is not needed, he
says, and we could cut ourtaxes by a
third if we cut it out.

I think we’ve all been fooled.
According to Mr. Bold, the govern-
ment shouldn’t be involved in waste-
ful activities like international

"diplomacy, printing dollars and

intelligence-gathering. Why protect
the consumer and why protect civil
rights? Why spend money on waste-
ful things like highways, airports,
dams and international monetary
institutions? And why student aid
when we could survive college with-
out it?

No, I guess the liberals and ljust
don’t realize that the government is
only defense, police and law. Excuse
us, but there’s a lot more there. City
-water is part of government, too.

That’s not all, folks, Mr. Bold also
says that welfare and Medicare are a
waste, and government shouldn’t
bother to help the poor. “No
rational philosophy has ever taught
that the productive individual’s duty
is to ensure the survival ofthose who
could be working but are not.”
Excuse me, a poor student of philo-
sophy,tagain. Most of the post-war
moral philosophy has emphasized a
duty tovaid the poor. It’s not only
OK to help, we have a duty to help.
Not all of us are lucky enough to be
born into rich families. Not all of us
can escape poverty. Not all of us can
overcome racism and sexism.

Unemployment . can be involun-

tary. That’s what welfare’s there for. ’

Welfare cheats ’don’t belong, but

Yes, a duty to aid the poor, to even
out the natural lottery of life, to
compensate those unlucky enough
to be born in the ghetto and to do
good where good can be done.

Mr. Bold says that welfare and
Medicare pay those who didn't earn
it. But did any of us earn a place in a
family rich enough to send us to col-
lege? Should we allow a system
which freely penalizes those unlucky
enough to be born penniless? Or will
we recognize the real issue here:
justice?

Empty Editorial

The Pitt News‘attempt to provide
the university with a model for
moral righteousness is nothing more

than a grotesque list of simple plati- ’

tudes. It attempts to substitute high-
wordedness for high-mindedness. In
so doing, it demonstrates more than
anything else the simplicity of its
own minds.

The editorial “To The University”
(Feb. 11) demonstrates the reality
deficiency of The Pitt News staff.
“How different the face of things
would be if everyone told the truth
always with no fear of punishment
or ridicule.” Are we to assume that
this moralistic mumbojumbo can be
described as “truth”? Unlike the edi-
torial staff,‘ we have to live in the real
world. We must face the consequen-
ces of our actions. We don’t have the
luxury of living in a fantasy world.

This editorial is written in a
fashion which is so vague that its
statements become meaningless. It
supports simplicity with a series of
unsupported complicated “truths.”
The editorial concludes that an hon-
est man is a free man. Try that in
Nazi Germany or to your professor's
face.

The Pitt News is hypocritically
telling others to be truthful, and in
the end this is the biggest lie of all.

Insensitive

This letter is in response to Kevin
Bold’s “Liberal Error,” which
appeared in the Feb. 13 issue of The
Pitt News. I have never before felt
obligated to write a letter to the edi-

tor, but when I read this letter, my .

heart sank.

Kevin Bold stated, “Welfare and
Medicare are not.only wasteful but
are based on the false premise that
people deserve something simply
because they ‘need’ it, as opposed to
working for it and earning it."

This is one of the most insensitive
and inhumanitarian statements We
ever read. What does he propose
that these people do? Would he hire
a man or ,woman 65 years old or
older to work for him? I seriously

I

Wednesday, February 20, l9§§

It is
a reed. We
will take

doubt it. Many of these people are
not able to work for physical rea-
sons. What does he propose that we
do, let them starve?

And one more thing: How can
anyone, excluding the rich, afford
the exorbitant cost of an emergency
operation or an extended hospital
stay? Should these people be denied
care just because they don’t have
enough money? '

Next, Bold talks about how
defense spending takes from all tax-
payers and helps all taxpayers. I’d
certainly like to know how paying
$430 for a hammer or $620 for a
toilet‘ seat helps me.

Mr. Bold also says that “in a free

society the government has only

three functions: to maintain suffi-
cient military force to provide
defense from hostile countries, to
support a police force to protect us
from criminals and to operate a judi-
cial system so we can settle civil and
criminal cases in court instead of
through feuds and vendettas.”

I disagree, especially in our proud
country. As Abraham Lincoln put
it, our government is a government
of the People, by the People and for
the People -— a statement which has
mademe proud to be an American.
The attitude taken by Kevin Bold
appears to be “for the people,” but
only if you can afford it.

I hope that someday Kevin and all’
the people like him will realize how
wrong they are. And when he gets
older or if he is ever stricken by
cancer or another serious disease, I
hope he gets help. Buy if we do away
with Medicare as he proposes, I
hope he has a lot of money or a very
generous family and very generous
friends. -

» You may call me a wimp, a bleed-
ing heart or a liberal for expressing
these feelings. I call myself a human
being, and I’m proud to be so.

From the Foul Line/ r Mark A. Sindler

What a coup. In its ceaseless
efforts to capture the entire Ameri-

- can reading population's attention,

USA Today has finally done it.

No longer will the Gannett publi-
cation have to resort to fanciful/ col-
orful ad gimmickry, impoverished
subscription rates or rapid-fire TV
commercials to seduce spare change
from the pocket. The contents on
page 6D of last Friday’s edition
ensured that.

It is a sign of things to come. Off .

to the left side was the TV preview of

“Hollywood Wives," the miniseries
toast to a “bevy of slick—looking
women (seductresses all) who turn
an infinite number of bedrooms into
brothels.

Saddling the right side ofthe same
page is a full-length ad for “Jerry
Falwell Live” on cable’s WTBS — as
in Jerry Falwell, founder ofthe con-
servative Moral Majority (as in
Moral Majority, committed, among
other purities, to obliterating
pornography.)

Surely the newspaper would not

Dirk Kaufman

have us believe this was some over-
sight. It was a statement —— an
imaginative one, in fact. Forget that
last week’s guest on Falwel1’s show
expounded on the alleged murder
(otherwise abortion) of a 12-week-
old fetus. Instead, there was an
attempt to either discredit steamy
sex scenes or posit one editorial
board’s stand toward the rightist
Moral Majority.

Call it novel editorializing, so u-
nique that more of the same can be
envisioned in the future. It’s fairly

Libel for the fun and profit

There’s a word in our language
that’s become popular of late. It con-
notes a certain degree of power to
some and a source of money to
others.

At any given moment, it is possi-
ble that any man on any street may,
while glancing through a newspaper,
stand up and scream 

LIBEL!

I certainly don’t intend to trivial-
ize the term. It’s a serious accusa-
tion. It’s also necessary that such a
word exist so that all of us may be
somewhat sure that we are safe from
the vicious claws of the media.

The strange thing is that, of late,
libel has become a separate news
story in itself. We’ve had the CBS vs.
Westmoreland case, the Time vs.
Sharon case and, yes, the cook vs.
high school newspaper case.

What? You don’t recall that third
one? Well, I’ll tell you.

In New York, the newspaper pub-
lished by Oriskany Falls High
School printed a story in 1981 in
which the food served in the cafete-
ria was described as “not fit for a
dog.”

The cook, who was discharged
even before the story appeared, filed
a libel suit against the paper and its
advisor and was just recently

rewarded $10,001 by a New York
Supreme Court jury.

The numeral 1 that you see at the
end of the three zeroes represents
what she received in damages for
libel: $1. The cook was awarded
$7,500 for damages, $2,500 going to
the husband for “loss of his wife’s
services.”

The problem I run into as your
basicvlayman/guy on the street is
that I know, at times, cafeteria food
is “not fit for a dog.” At times, the
food I cook for myselfis “not fit for a
dog.” From this, as a journalist, I
infer a moral conflict.

Is the media to be held responsible
for a statement such as the phrase
“not fit for a dog”? .

Of course. We are responsible for
every word we print. But is it wrong
to print what has become obvious to
the public, even though that infor-
mation may, offend some particular
person? I do not believe so. I believe
that we are here to report what we
see. To say that we must be entirely
objective and held responsible for
this objectivity in every story we
cover is naive.

I am not advocating any sort of
sloppy journalism. I assume
(naively?) that all journalists are
professionals and that none would

sit behind a typewriter with intent to
libel someone. To do this would be
self-defeating and job-threatening.

A statement like “not fit for a dog"

about food that is indeed worthyiof
such a statement is not wrong —- the
testimony of those who eat the food
will prove that. How was the defen-
dent able to prove that the food was
in fact fit for a dog? Surely, anything
the cook produced is, by now, lost.

The kicker in any libel case is
whether the alleged victim can prove
actual malice. One must prove that
the writer wrote the piece with the
intention of defaming that person.
Whether or not the newspaper
wanted to defame the cook is subject
to debate. Was the story written with
intent to defame or to accurately
report what was happening?

The jury determined that the
accusation of libel merited $1, the
other $10,000 being for personal
damage. If the paper was correct -
and I assume it was —— we now have a
woman in society who is $10,001
richer because she can’t cook, and a
newspaper said that she couldn't.

Libel accusations have become
chic. Things become chic when peo-
ple find them lucrative and easy to
accomplish. Libel should never have
become easy for either party.

The Pitt News needs new energetic
writers to take the nextstep toward

becoming a great student publication.

‘HOAGIES . ,

Ads, Fads, and the Latest Editorial Fashions

simple: Place a TV preview opposite
an ad for a purist group whose
intents parallel or conﬂict with those
of the program’s contents.

The time is winter 1986, and a
sequel to “Consenting Adults" —
aired earlier about one family’s
homosexual son and brother —— is
readied for showing. Entitled “Out-
cast in the Family,” its plot includes
a banished teen who eventually finds
himself working in a Bay Area bath-
house. In the meantime, the
National Gay Task Force mounts a
nationwide ad campaign for its
10,000 members and interested
applicants. Scheduled are work-
shops for AIDS victims who have
yet to ﬁle their own wills.

The time is summer 1986 and the
place could be either Las Vegas,
Miami or wherever organized rack-
eteering thrives. The Brotherhood of
Teamsters, two million strong,
advertise discount hotel/ travel rates
for their quinquennial convention.
Coinciding is the 11th anniversary of
Jimmy Hoffa's mysterious disap-
peararice, marked by a docudrama
on the former teamster president’s
life. It never reveals whose body was
really found in that New Jersey gar-
bage dump.

The time should be today, and the
miniseries should be entitled “Inner
Cities: A Core Rotted Through.”
Funding is being provided by‘the
National League of Cities, formerly
thought to be a major league base-
ball consortium. It’s really a lobby-
ing group— providing civic and
cultural aid to cities. At the same
time, the Sierra Club makes public
its anti-lumber industry campaign,
“preserving and restoring the quality
of the environment and the integrity
of the ecosystem.” Neither group
realizes its shared interests in the
Newark metropolitan area, Chica-

go’s Southside, the Bronx, Hialeah '

Miami and southeast Washington,

D.C.

The time is today and the weekly
PBS series is “The Constitution:
That Delicate Balance.” Each Wed-
nesday, the viewer gets a preview of
that evening's program contents.
One week, the John Birch Society
reaffirms its arrogance in print
advertising. Anti-communist, it is an
educational group wanting less
government, more responsibility
and, with the Lord’s aid, a better
world. What the good Birch folks *'
don’t reveal are their strains of white
supremacy, Anglo-Saxon style.

The time is next fall and Aaron
Spelling publicizes another new sit-
com, “Love Boat, Cruise II."It has a
new twist: Portrayed are the lives of
single Yuppies who meet on these
one-week flings, the ladies later
separately and uniquely dealing with
the fact each of them are pregnant.

USA Today runs its season pre-
view. By happenstance that same
day, the American Life Lobby
informs its 139,000 members in-half-
page ads of an upcoming sandwich
board assault on Pennsylvania
Avenue. Protesters are allowed to
bring their toddlers to the White
House, if they desire.

Students celebrate black history

By Susan Benedek
The Pitt News

“The tortuous road which has led
from Montgomery to Oslo is a road
over which millions of Negroes are
traveling to ﬁnd a new sense of

dignity.”
— Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
Dec. 11, 1964
An excerpt from
a speech accepting
the Nobel Prize

Black students at Pitt are remem-
bering their cultural, political and
social past and anticipating the
future as they celebrate February as
Black History Month. ,

The Black Action Society at Pitt
sponsored the national event to raise
the consciousness of black students
by offering lectures, films, concerts
and debates promoting black
awareness.

“What Black" History Month
attempts to do is knock on your
door to let you know that it is your
personal duty to promote the aware-
ness of blacks in history,” stated
Daryl Davis, executive assistant at
BAS. 2

This year’s theme focuses on the

., to try‘ and make this university a
.little safer, and they won't even
allow us to meet in the Quad for 20 .

minutes. I’m paying tuition. Don’t I
have a right to use a university
building?"

“Pitt is a commuter school, yet the
safety of the commuters seems to be

black family. The topic partly devel-
oped from last year’s theme of
“admission and attrition.”

“We found that the basic require-
ments of math, English and science
were not being fulfilled at the high
school level," explained Davis.
“They were not on the transcripts.
The family needs to reinforce educa-
tion. We need to emphasize that the
family is the backbone of the black
race.”

Tony Brown, a black journalist
who recently lectured at Pitt stated:
“Every person in this room had
someone in their life who cared
enough to provide motivaton and
positive reinforcement. That is why
you students are here.

“We want college students to go
home and express the importance of
their education," Davis continued.
“What we don’t want is younger
black children learning how to work
at McDonald’s, making the better
hamburger.”

In addition to the focus on family,
Black History Month hopes to
enlighten those black Americans
who are unaware of their history.

“Many blacks do not know that
the first man to die in the Revolu-
tionary War was black, or that a
black man helped layout Washing-
ton, D.C.,” explained Celestine

irrelevant to Pitt’s Safety adminis-
tration,” said Ethel Cook, a sopho-
more at Pitt. “The campus police
don’t cover any area except the
immediate campus. I walk home
from the library every night scared
to death and I only live seven blocks
from campus. The Oakland police
aren’t there...someone has to be the
filler.”

Georgia (UPI) —- Former
Oklahoma Baptist preacher Van
Roosevelt was executed by the
State of Georgia early this morn-
ing for the torture/murder of a
convenience store manager in
1979.

The State Board of Pardons and

Making blacks more conscious of
their potential in society has brought
about internal conflict, according to
Davis. “Inside, a black person is try-
ing to maintain their blackness and
then trying to assimilate into the
white majority.

“We use the word ‘incognegro’ to
describe such a ‘person. It‘s derived
from the word ‘incognito.’ We label
a person incognegro because he or
she feels they have to be more Cau-
casian to be better."

Black History Month first started
in the 1920s, and its purpose was to
show how blacks have contributed
to society.

This year seems to be going well,
according to Dr. Rick Blackett. “A
number’ of the faculty at black stu-
dies have been around the city giving
lectures and speeches,” Blackett
said.

As the month draws to a close,
students have been asked to wear
black, red and green ribbons to sym-
bolize black consciousness. Free rib-
bons may be obtained at the BAS
office.

Attendance at the various lectures
and films has been “mediocre,”
according to programming coordi-
nator Camille White. The Phyllis
Hyman concert on Feb. 24 promises
to be a success. Tickets are $4 with
student I.D. and $9 without.

Angels patrol Shadyside area

The Pitt chapter of the Guardian
Angels is going to continue their
recruiting drive and try to generate
some student support.

“If the students want "us to be put-
ting our energy into this, they are
going to have to start taking a stand
on the issue,” said sophomore Rad
Quinn. “Right now nobody is listen-
ing to us but ourselves.”

Police Report

By Samuel Thompson
The Pitt News

Jeffrey Scott Mohr, 20, a Pitt student, was stabbed Monday morn-
ing on North Dithridge Street near Bayard Street. He is in “satisfac-
tory” condition at Presbyterian-University Hospital after spending
two days in the surgical intensive care unit, said a hospital spokesman.

According to police reports, Mohr was passing the assailant and
thought he recognized him. The assailant responded by stabbing
Mohr in the chest. Mohr then ran to 245 North Dithridge and col-
lapsed in the hall. A resident reported the incident.

A witness spotted the assailant ﬂagging cars on Fifth Avenue near
Bigelow Boulevard. He was seen entering a car registered to Vincent
Angel of 382 Lehigh St., Pittsburgh. The knife was not found and
identification of the assailant was delayed because of Mohr’s
condition.

##**¥

Vincent E. Jordan, 30, of 2158 Elmore Sq. is being held on charges
of burglary and illegal trespassing for an attempted burglary Thurs-
day night at 321 Melwood Ave. The suspect reportedly knocked at
apartment 201, alerting the occupant, then went to the third floor and
paced the hall, arousing the suspicions ofthe occupant in 302. He then
allegedly began to force the door of apartment 301 with an l8-inch
screwdriver. He reportedly was unable to enter because of a second
chain lock.

Officers Kennedy and Sauer of station No.4 met Jordan at the door
of the building. The screwdriver and an alleged marijuana cigarette
were found in his possession. The crime lab reported that the screw-
driver matched the markings on the door of 301 and at least 5 other
doors to apartments previously burglarized.

Apartment manager Nancy Filipiak told police that the building
had been burglarized numerous times recently.

Jordan's hearing is scheduled for the Feb. 20 morning session.

*III*##

Geraldine Watson, an Oakland woman, was reportedly robbed and
abducted last Thursday morning after leaving Magee-Womens Hos-
pital by two black men in their 20s. Watson crossed Halket St. and
passed the men, who were apparently working under the hood of a
light green Oldsmobile. The men pointed a“long—barreled revolver” at
her and forced her into the front seat.

The men drove Watson to Wilkinsburg, taking $160 and some
jewelry from her. The abductors stopped at a large house where

E Watson was released. No suspects have been found.

*#*#¥

Paul Cisco and Mark Smith, both of Oakland, were assaulted
Friday by two young black men with nunchuks. Both were treated at
Montefiore Hospital for bruises and lacerations and were released.

*****

Franklin and Marshall student Dwelley W. Parker, ~19, a member of
the F&M chapter of Zeta Beta Tau fraternity, was assaulted Sunday
morning at a party at the Pitt ZBT chapter.

Parker was treated at Presbyterian-University Hospital for an
injured left jaw and a missing tooth. The assailant is described as 6-0,
of medium build, clean-shaven and wearing eyeglasses.

vSoftware such as Insearch and
Search Helper simplify the process
with menus and help screens. Other
software being added to the lab
includes the Professional Bibliogra-
phy System, BRS After Dark and
Sci-Mate (including personal data
management and universal on-line
searches). Each database offers
information on a wide variety of
topics.

To begin a search, just type in the
subject you want information about
—— for example, basketball. Next,
narrow the subject down — Pitt bas-
ketball or Coach Chipman and the
Pitt basketball team. The computer
will dial a database and retrieve all
current indexes containing Coach
Chipman and the Pitt basketball
team. Each index will appear on the
screen one by one and can be copied
for later use.

Databases contain references to
more material than is available at
the University of Pittsburgh librar-
ies. Consult the Serials List to see if
the given references can be located in
Pitt libraries. If the material is not
available, it may be borrowed
through the interlibrary loan
department.

The laboratory suggests that a
search would be helpful: 1) if the
topic is current and does not yet
appear in printed sources; 2) if the

topic is very specific and cannot be If

located under a subject heading in
printed indexes; and 3) ifthe topic is
a combination of two or more sub-

ject headings (“The Relationship of I
Locus of Control to Athletic Perfor- -

mance," for instance).

The laboratory is still being com- 

pleted. Ten IBM personal comput-
ers will be installed by July 1985,
along with four printers.

The laboratory is on a one-year V

trial basis through December 1985,
when an evaluation and decision will
be made on whether or not the
library will continue the service.
“Our goal right now is to see if it

works,” said Fern Brody, coordina- ,

.7 The Pitt News '

In an age when a young child can
live carrying a baboon's heart, and a
human being can survive an artifi-
cial heart transplant, most would
say the world of medicine is making
progress. Just ask Murray Haydon
or William Shroeder, they’ll tell you.
But what is the cost of such a
miracle?

In the case of 18-year-old fresh-

heart transplant poses little problem
at the present time, but the obstacle
she faces in getting there presents

obstacle is the $100,000 they need to
keep her alive.

warth, 20, of West Mifﬂin, discov-

from cardiomyopathy, a condition

M and become ﬂabby.

“It almost feels as if I were in a

i dream,” Malinowski said. “If it were
 happening to someone else’s sister, I

might believe it’, but not mine."
Holzwarth’s problem began
March 23, after she gave birth to her
first child. During any pregnancy
the heart expands, but hers did not
return to its normal state after giving
birth. She was informed that her
heart muscles would never return to
their original state and that the only

The Pitt News, Wednesday, February 20, 1985

Pitt student’s sister in need of new heart

alternative would be to undergo a
heart transplant operation.

“This crisis has really brought this
family closer together,” said John
Holzwarth, Mary's husband. “lt’s
almost as if we're fighting this battle
together,"as a team. If we're going to
win, it has to be this way.”

Holzwarth discovered her condi-
tion 10 days after being laid offfrom
her job, which supported her 22-
year-old husband and her nine-
month-old son. Her husband only
works part-time, and she was denied
Social Security benefits.

Malinowski is currently seeking
assistance with several university
organizations to aid him in raising
funds for his sister’s operation. The
surgery could. take place in the next
three months to three years, depend-
ing on donor availability.

“Our backs are against the wall,”
Malinowski said. “The chance of

~ getting this particular disease in this

fashion is almost one in a million.
The life expectancy after the trans-
plant would still only be five years.”
The doctors in charge are putting
the operation off for as long as possi-
ble, mainly because the money
hasn’t been raised yet, but also
because of the fact that new technol-
ogy could soon produce better odds
for survival. .
Holzwarth’s condition has been
no small issue for the local media.
Articles have appeared in the
McKeesport Daily News and
CMU’s Tartan. WTAE-TV also ran

holidays.

“We aren’t looking for sym-
pathy,” Malinowski commented.
“But in order to raise the money, it
has to be brought out in public.”

So far, the response has been
incredible. The fund raising began
last December at the Malinowskis'
home parish in West Mifflin. The
Rev. George Margo of Holy Trinity
Church established the Mary Lisa
Malinowski Holzwarth Fund to
help finance her operation.

The initial step involved a bow1-a-
thon at Duquesne Village Lanes on
Dec. 30. Most of the $15,000 the
church has raised thus far came from
this project.

Alpha Phi Omega, the national
service fraternity at CMU, has
joined the fund-raising effort, asking
students to participate.

The fraternity's annual Stuffed
Sweethearts sale last week began the
campaign and all proceeds in their
upcoming activities will go to the
Holzwarth fund.

“We have been very grateful for
the response so far,” remarked Holz-
warth’s mother, Florence Husfelt, a
financial aid office employee at
CMU. “We still have a long road
ahead of us, though, because we now
face an initial payment of $20,000 to
secure the operation.”

Residents and businesses in West
Mifflin have received pleas from the
West Mifflin City Council to help
secure the transplant.

Council president George Miklos
is seeking assistance from both local

businesses and residents. Miklos
commented earlier this year in the
McKeesport Daily News, “I hope
the business people here can rally
behind us."

Fund coordinator Marian Nissen
said that donations can be sent to the
Mary Lisa Malinowski Holzwarth
Fund, in care of Holy Trinity
Church, 529 Grant Avenue Exten-
sion, in West Mifflin.

Since these three projects began,
Holzwarth’s old high school, West
Mifﬂin North, has set plans for a
rafﬂe to help raise some of the
money.

“If we can, we are hoping for
assistance from a Pitt organization,”
Malinowski said. “Because of the
large student population, I think a
fund raiser would be very
successful.”

Even if the operation is successful,
funds would still be needed for anti-
rejection drugs, which run approxi-
mately $700 per month.

“I sure hope we can pull this
through,” stated Malinowski.
“We’ve been working so hard that it
sometimes feels as if we aren't get-
ting anywhere.”

If any student, organization or
other university personnel is inter-
ested in contributing to the Holz-
warth cause, contact Lenny
Malinowski at 624-9002 or 624-
9346. «

“We offer the opportunity for
undergraduates to collaborate with
faculty and improve courses in crea-
tive ways, in ways that faculty can-
not do themselves,” said Barry
Applbaum, assistant director of the
University Honors program. “The
idea is that this kind ofjoint effort
will enhance the course in a way
that’s beneficial to everyone.”

These opportunities are the

“Our interest ‘is in improving

“The awards committee looks for
originality, creativity and clear evi-
dence that better teaching will
result,” commented Applbaum. In a
successful proposal, a student and
faculty member must show some
evidence that the direct result of
their student-faculty effort will
result in a more effective course, and
that without such a collaboration a
significant improvement would be
difficult or impossible. The proposal

Some analysts say it may even hit

The problems were highlighted
Friday in Londonein a meeting
between ruling conservative party

Gummer was less than compli-

Applbaum, there is a recent lack of
proposals being submitted and those
worth funding. This is perhaps due
to the program’s lack of exposure
and publicity. There are eight or 10
going on, but there should be at least
12. “It’s unfortunate,” Appplbaum
said. “The money allocated for fund-
ing is lost; it’s put back into the uni-

Applbaum emphasized that the

Gummer said the dollar is over-

resulting concern was felt not only in
Britain but on the continent as well.

He said that favorable U.S. inter-

“Like I said, it’s not my point to
make any suggestions,"said Black, a
19-year-old religious studies major.

Applbaum commented.

Each student teaching fellow is
awarded $500 for implementing the
proposed project. These funds are
usually retained by the fellow as a
stipend; however, the award may be
used to defray expenses. At the dis-

cretion of the faculty member’s’

department or school, academic
credit can be awarded. Most depart-
, ments and schools have an inde-
pendent study mechanism that can
be used for this purpose.
Applbaum said that the Chancel-

(UPI) — Pennsylvania senator

the transportation department to
sell Conrail, the governmerit—owned
freight carrier, through a public
stock offering. ~

Said Specter, “The sale of Conrail
to Norfolk Southern would be
totally inconsistent with the public
interest and a disaster for our
national transportation system.”

He said Norfolk Southern’s pur-
chase price of $1.2 billion was “pat-
entlv inadequate.”

Specter also charged that a Nor-
folk Southern-Conrail merger
would create a giant railroad that
would adverselyaffect freight rail
competition in the northeast and
midwest states it serves.

On Feb. 8, transportation secre-

tary Elizabeth Dole picked Norfolk .

Southern 'over two other final
bidders to buy Conrail.

Dole rejected a public stock offer-
ing, saying it might not attract
enough investor interest to match
the Norfolk Southern Offer.

The Conrail sale will come before
congressional committees for review
next week.

 LANDOVER, Md. — It was
billed as Nissan Corporation's
“Major Motion Night” at the
Capitol Center, and indeed, it
seemed as though the entire George-
town team majored in just that -
handing the Pitt Panthers a crushing
70-46 defeat, their worst of the
season

I The Hoyas were impenetrable on
defense, holding Pitt to just 17 ﬁeld
goals and blocking 13 shots, nine of
which were by Pat Ewing. “We were
totally outplayed,” said Roy Chip-
man. “This is the best I’ve seen
Georgetown play all year. lt_would
take a great team to beat them. Their
defense is just awesome. You can’t
do much against that.”

The Panthers couldn’t do much of
anything last night. Early in the first
half, they were down_l I-0 and didn’t
score their first basket until three

“' For The Pitt News

When the University of Pitts-
burgh track team started off its

season in December, head coach
John Vasvary knew he had a lot
of work ahead of him.The
Panther team is a young one,
made up of only two seniors,
middle distance runner Mickey
Rihtarchik and pole vaulter
Rodney Chobany, and one jun-
ior, sprinter, Dorrell Hilliman.
The rest of the 24-man roster is
comprised of freshmen and
sophomores.

That youth did not hold the
Panthers back too much as they
placed ﬁfth in the Big East
Indoor Championships held this
weekend at the Carrier Dome in
Syracuse.

“We knew at the beginning of
the season that we were young,”

 Vasvary said. “We gained a lot of
experience at the meet. Our
freshman learned some things.

“I am happy with the way we
performed. The guys responded
well to the meet and situations.
The people "we brought back
from last year performed better
this year. Hopefully, that will
carry over to next year.”

Leading the way for the
Panthers was freshman sprinter
McRae defeating three-time

defending champion Mike Mor-
ris from Syracuse in the 55-meter
dash. McRae's time of 6. 17 set a
new Big East record and won
him the Most Outstanding Per-
formance award. He also placed
second in the 300-meter with a
time of 34.69. “It was great,"
McRae said about winning the
55-meter. “I felt good the whole
way. I knew ifl came in and did
what I've done at previous meets
that I'd win the Big East. I
needed more strength in the 300.
I gave up at the end of the race. I

named

Being up against more expe-
rienced competition could have
held McRae back, but it did not
have that effect on him.

“With all of the hoopla about
Morris before the race, a less
mature athlete might have suc-
cumbed to the pressure,” Vas-
vary said. “Lee did a super job.
With time, he’s going to get a lot
tougher.”

Freshman George Iﬁll placed
second in the long jump and his
23-7% jump qualiﬁed him for the
, IC4A Championships to be held
March 2 at Princeton, N.J.

“George jumped super in the
competition,” Vasvary said. “He
has a great future ahead of him.”

In the preliminaries of the 500-
meter dash, sophomore Alan
Laws qualiﬁedfor the IC4A’s
and set a Pitt record with his time
of l:04.02. In the ﬁnals, he ﬁn-
ished fourth overall with a
1:04.42. .

Freshman Rogers Thomas
and sophomore Jesse Mikell
were both injured at the meet and
were kept out of the relay. Pole
vaulter Rodney Chobany sus-
tained a back injury earlier in the
season and was unable to com-
pete, leaving the vaulting to
sophomores Jim Johnson and
Bill Lantz. I

“The guys all performed their
best," Vasvary said. “They are
realizing the importance and
intensity of each race. We got as
much out of the guys that we

~ could.”

The Lady Panthers finished
eighth with three points. Lisa
Williams, who was hampered by
a hamstring pull, finished sev-
enth in the 1,000 meter run and
sixth in the 500-meter.

Sue Torre ﬁnished seventh in
the 400-meter and Amy DiFran-
cesco ﬁnished eighth in the
1,500-meter run. In the prelimi-
naries of the 55-meter dash,
Dana Roberts placed seventh in
her heat and did not qualify for
the finals.

Big East teams do not win by
defense alone, and Georgetown was
no less impressive with the ball, hit-
ting 53.4 percent from the floor and
72.7 percent from the line. George-
town’s attack was keyed by the pass-
ing of forward Dave Wingate and
guards Michael Jackson and Reggie
Williams. “That is something we
work on a lot in practice,” Jackson
said. “It just doesnTt come to us in
games. We have experience playing
offense with each other."

Pitt's Darryl Shepherd agreed:

“They all seem like they can read
each others’ minds. They know what
the others are going to do and where
they’re going to be at every
moment.” _

Pitt tried to remain upbeat about
the game, although the only positive
note Chipman could muster was
that “the game is over.” _

Joey David added: “Things like
this happen, but I look forward to
games like these. It’s a chance to see
what you’re made of. If we didn’t
think we could compete with teams
like Georgetown and St. John’s, we
wouldn’t be in the Big East.”

‘The Pitt News

The Pitt men’s track team ﬁn-
ished fifth with 56 points in a field of
nine at the Big East Indoor Cham-
pionships this weekend at Syracuse.
Villanova won the meet with 99.25

points; placing second, third and‘
‘ fourth were St. John’s (98), George-

town (91) and Syracuse (71.5).

“Of course, you always want to
win, obviously,” said Pitt head
coach John Vasvary on the Panther
ﬁnish. “The"t'hing for our team is to
get the experience and grow. Eve-
ryone that was there last year did
well — they showed the experience
of having been there.”

Lee McRae of Pembroke, N.C.,
continued in his successful freshman
ways. He set a new meet record and
qualified for the Intercollegiate
Amateur Athletic Association of
America and the NCAA champion-
ships with a time of 6.17 in the 55-
meter dash. The IC4As are held
March 2-3 at Princeton and the
NCAAS will be March 8-9.

“Morris had to go sometime,”
McRae said after the race. “I was
just waiting for the chance.”

“He got a great jump," said three-
time defending champion Mike
Morris of Syracuse, who ﬁnished in
6:19. “If it was the 100 or something,
I would have caught him, but it
wasn’t. My career isn’t over. I'll see
him again at the IC4As in March.”

Micky Rhitarchik, the only senior
on the squad, ran a l:54.08 leg in
Pitt’s sixth-place ﬁnish in the dis-
tance medley relay; the Panthers‘
time in that event was 10: 14,54. Rhi-
tarchik's time in the two—mile relay,
in which Pitt ﬁnished third with
7:38.00, was l:56.0l-. ‘

“I was really pleased with his leg
on the DMR,” Vasvary said. “He
personally recovered. In the two-
mile relay, he got caught back inthe
pack but fought his way back into
the race. He rose to the occasion. He

came to the meet and gave it his all, _

and I can’t ask for any more than
that”

Many Panthers scored in the
meet. In the 55-meter hurdles, Cal-
vin Holmes (second with 7:51) and

Jason Harris (fourth with 7:57)
qualiﬁed for the IC4As. Alan Laws
set a Pitt record by running a 1:04.02
in the trials for the 500-meter run.
His fourth-place ﬁnish (l:04.42) in
the ﬁnals qualified him for the
IC4As and NCAAS. Tim Manes’

fourth-place ﬁnish in the 800-meter‘

run (l:53.40) also qualified him for
the IC4As.

“All of our runners ran close to
their best individually,” Vasvary
said. “Naturally, we would have
liked to have finished higher, team-
wise, but hopefully that will come
with experience. With the expe-
rience that they gained here, we will
be tough in the future.”

Vasvary also said that although
the championship may have been
out of reach this season, with a few
breaks the team could have finished
in a high position. In a few of the
races, Pitt runners ﬁnished seventh,
almost missing a score, and two ath-
letes pulled muscles in their races
and had to withdraw. Rogers Tho-
mas ran the 55- and the 300-meter,
and Jesse Mikell had to stop in the
finals of the 500-meter run on
Sunday. '

“Coach [Bob] Lewis [program
coordinator of men’s sports at Pitt]
and I felt that, coming in three years
ago, it would take some time build-
ing the program back up,” Vasvary
said. “We are both willing to take the
time that is necessary to see that the
program becomes a success.”

The future of the track team looks
bright to Vasvary.) “I was pretty
pleased with our performance. We

got some real good things accomp-
lished, and everyone will be back
next year.”

Athletes honored for academic achievement

Kohutiak named All-America

By Laurie Kubli
The Pitt News

A season of MVP honors and all-
tournament team selections was
capped by an honorable mention
All-America achievement for senior
Ulana Kohutiak, a middle blocker
on Pitt’s volleyball team.

“I didn’t think I’d get it,” Kohu-
tiak said. “I worked hard for it, butl
wasn’t expecting it. There are a lot of
great players out there, and it’s nice
to be considered among the top 18.”

It may be unexpected due to the
fact that no other player from Pitt
and only two other players from the
East have achieved that status.
(Cindy Cambers received the award
from the Association for Intercolle-
giate Athletics for Women, which no
longer exists. Pitt is now a member
of the NCAA.)

“Ulana’s senior‘ season was the
best individual performance by any
Pitt volleyball player in the history

of the program,” said head coach
Shelton Collier. “She was consis-
tently excellent and, every week,
outplayed middle blockers on Top
10 and Top 20 teams. There were
only two players from the East on
the entire All-America and Honora-
ble Mention team. We are proud to
have one of them. It’s a tribute to

Ulana and a significant event for our

program.” A

Kohutiak, a physical education
and health major from Mississauga,
Ont., led Pitt to a 30-8 season that
culminated in recapturing the Big
East title, for which she was named
MVP. She was awarded the MVP at
the LSU Classic, the Temple Invita-
tiomal and the Pitt Classic as well.
She was selected to the all-
tournament teams at the Tennessee
Classic, the Pitt Invitational and the
Western Michigan Holiday Classic.

In addition, Kohutiak broke her
own record (33) for number of kills
in a single match by a Pitt player
when she registered 40 against
Missouri.

Signings: Collier hopes to have a
replacement for Kohutiak in 5-11
middle blocker Nora Mulvihill. She
led Norwin High School to the
PIAA championship this past year
and was regarded as the top player in
the state.

Collier stated that Mulvihill was
regarded as the No. l middle blocker
in the East and was “the most heav-
ily recruited volleyball player ever
out of Pennsylvania.” Pitt won this
recruiting battle with Penn State —
which Mulvihill had also considered
attending — as well as a second bat-
tle over New ‘ Yorker Denise
Frawley.

Frawley, a 5-10 athlete from
Thornwood, N.Y., was first brought
to Collier’s attention by former Pitt
standout Paula Olsen.

“She jumps high and hits hard,”
said Collier. “Denise is the best col-
legiate prospect to come out of the
East in a long time and is without
question the No. 1 player this year
on the east coast."

Pitt also signed 5- 10 setter Dianne
Zerby from Holland, Ohio, where

’ she was selected to the first team

all-state squad. Zerby is likely to
replace Cathy Rupp, another Ohio
native, whose wide range of sets
enabled Pitt to win the Big East
crown.

Also in this year’s freshman class
will be Tennessee transfer Lisa Ste-
wart, who will be eligible in the fall.
At 5-8, the outside hitter from Far-
rell, Pa., has the highest vertical
jump on the team at 29 inches.

Women defeat ‘St.’ John’s;
seniors end on winning note

20. 1985
I-

By Jim Urban
The Pitt News

It seemed like one big weight had

been lifted off the shoulders of
Coach Judy Saurer after the Pitt
women's basketball team beat Bos-
ton College 70-6l last Saturday
afternoon at the field house.

QPutting aside what had been a
frustrating season so far, the Lady
Panthers played their finest game to
date as they tune up for the Big East
tournament at the end ofthe month.

The game took on more meaning

than just Pitt vs. Boston College.
This
appearance in the field house for the
five senior members of Saurer’s
squad. Saurer paid tribute to the
Class of 1985, consisting of Jennifer
Bruce, Lisa Fubio, Stephanie Col-
lins, Ellen Gilhooley and Becky
tﬁaziarz, by starting an all-senior
lineup for the first time this season.

The seniors answered with an

The Lady Panthers, minus Bruce,
pulled away from the Eagles for a
l5-point lead, 60-45, at the 7:40
mark.

The Eagles finally began to put
things together at this point. After
switching to a full-court pressure
defense, the Eagles finally caused
some turnovers, and Pitt's lead
dwindled to 11 points, 66-55.

Re-enter Bruce. Following her
short stay on the bench, the senior
forward returned to the lineup and
brought some stability with her. Pitt
and BC exchanged buckets the rest
of the game, with Pitt prevailing 70-
61.

Pitt was paced by three seniors, all
in double figures. Bruce led the way
with 26 points, despite being bat-

tered throughout the game. Fubio ‘

followed with l6 and Gilhooley
added 15. Fubio also had a season
high of six steals.

Saurer was all smiles and quick to
praise after the game, beginning
with the seniors. “The seniors played

pulled down 10 rebounds and had
two blocks. “She played real well,"
said Saurer. “She really came
through for us."

Pitt will need the same type of
play tonight when they face the St.
John's Express in Jamaica, N.Y. A
victory tonight will leave the Lady
Panthers tied for second with St.
Johns.

While Pitt has been enjoying bet-
ter times of late, St. John’s has had
things toughen up a bit. Two leading
scorers, Faye -Gerald and Barb
Rapp, were dismissed from the
team, and the move has taken its
toll. St. John’s was blown out in
their last game, a 70-54 loss to Vil-
lanova on Saturday.

Saurer is confident, yet cautious.
“The loss of Gerald and Rapp takes
32 points out of their offense,” said
Saurer, “yet they still scored 96
points against Georgetown last
Wednesday night.”

Indeed, it will be no walk through
the park, but a win tonight will
almost insure Pitt of a good seed in
the tournament. St. John’s won the

Young swimmer
shows promlse

By Tom Horew
For The Pitt News

University of Pittsburgh swimmer
Marian Cassidy is the kind of athlete
every coach likes to have.

“Marian is very versatile in the
water and a strong swimmer,” said
women’s swimming coach Dave
Belowich. “This versatility is -a big
plus. We can put Marian in any-
where and feel confident.”

The freshman from Wilmington,
Del., has been in the water since she
was six and has been making waves
ever since. She came to Pitt for a
number of reasons: the swimming
program, her teammates and the
coach.

“I like Pittsburgh and the diverse
opportunities associated with living
in the city,” she said.

Swimming takes up a great deal of
Cassidy’s time, but not all of her

Although her career at Pitt is in its
formative stages, it appears to be a
bright one.

“Marian has the possibility to be
very good," stated Belowich. “She
has the talent to leave her mark as
one of the best 200- or 500-yard
freestylers in Pitt history.”

She is confident ofthis year’s team"
and forecasts another Big East

Her main goal for this year’s team
is to have them crack the Top 10 in
the nation. She would like to make
qualifying cuts for the NCAA

things in her spare time, although
getting away from the water isn’t one

A of them. “No way,” she said. “I love

Panthers beat Gannon, take first

By Mary Wolf
The Pitt News

The Pittsburgh Hockey Club is
now 15-2-1 after recording its
second shutout of the season Mon-
day night with a 4-0 victory over

_'rd-ranked Gannon. This win was
especially significant for the Pan-
thers, who were seeking revenge
after an agonizing 4-0 loss to Gan-

The Pitt News, Wednesday, February 20, 1985

non earlier in the season. The Pan-
thers are now in first place in the
West Penn College Hockey Associa-
tion with 31 points, and close behind
is Duquesne.

The Panthers’ first encounter with
Gannon (in early November) took
place on the Golden Knights’ home
ice in Erie, where the turnout for an
average hockey game is around 800.
“The crowd only bothers you as
much as you let it bother you,” said
left wing Kurt" Stetzer. “It’s all in

how much attention you pay to
them.”

But several of the Pitt skaters
remember all too well the unfriendly
welcomes they have received from
the Gannon crowd in the past. ‘‘It’s
always been tough playing there,”
said Pitt senior Jim Lang, recalling
an especially bad incident which
occurred his freshman year on the
team. “As soon as Gannon scores,
their fans throw tennis balls at you.
We wanted to get them bad. You can

Monday night on the Panthers’
home ice in Lakeview, the Pitt skat-
ers had the opportunity to get back
at the Golden Knights, just as they
did against Duquesne two weeks
ago.

“We hit Gannon hard. They didn’t
check us but we were checking
them," said co-captain Damon
Brown. “I guess you could say that I
led the checking parade.”

“It was a real defensive type game,
and our defense played really well,”
explained left wing Jim Owens Jr.
“Gannon only had about four chan-
ces to really score. We had a lot of
chances, but their goalie played
really good and he made a lot of
break-away saves.”

Young went without giving up a goal
while on the ice. “All of the lines
have been playing really great,” said
Lang. “They can all score real well.”

The goalie for this Pitt shutout
was John Godwin, who stopped 25
shots for the Panthers.

The next opponent for the Pitt
skaters is Bethany, the only team in
the league I which the Panthers
haven’t played yet this season and
therefore the only team which they
haven’t beaten yet. “We got every-
body paid back except Bethany,”
said Setzer. “They’re next on the
list.”

The Panthers will travel to Wheel-
ing tonight to contend with Bethany
in the hopes of bringing home a six-
teenth win. “Last year we went down
there and they beat us. But we’ve
proved ourselves by beating every-
body else at once,” said Lang. “If we
play well, we should be able to beat
them.”

“Our team is in a pretty good
standing right now,” said Brown.
“We’re just going to skate all over

them."

By Laurie Kubli
The Pitt News

The Pitt men’s basketball team
(15-8 overall, 6-7 in the Big East)
gave St. John’s little reason to fear
an upset. The Redmen kept their
No. 1 ranking intact by defeating
Pitt 84-63 Friday in Alumni Hall,
but you wouldn’t know it by listen-
ing to winning coach Lou
Carnesecca.

The Man with the Sweater (“The
sweater did it,” he claims) ignored
his team’s lofty position atop colle-
giate basketball. “We don’t even
know about it. Are my guys acting
any differently? I don’t know about
it, the guys don’t know about it.”

The 6,500-plus fans jamming the
gymnasium were well aware of St.
John’s ranking — as were the
scalpers ($25 per ticket) outside in
the 30-degree night air — before the
game even began. It quickly became
evident to the Panthers as well.

Within five minutes of the open-
ing tipoff, Pitt was behind 12-6.
Midway through the half, Chris
Mullin’s free throws (two of 21
points) put the home team up 24-10.
St. John's built their biggest lead
(37-14) with 6:08 remaining in the
half.

I “They beat us in the first five min-
utes of the game,” said head coach
Roy Chipman. “We didn’t get back
on defense. We gave them too many
easy baskets.”

Despite the apparent ease with
which the win was accomplished,
Carnesecca downplayed the point
difference. “Tonight was important
for the record,” he said.

St. John's has now won 17 in a
row, their only upset coming against
Niagara. “A league win is worth two
games,” he said. '

Carnesecca said that he does not
have to look far to find his talent.
The success of his team stems from
its experience. “Four of them have
played together for a long time,” he
said. “We’re very provincial. They
all live 20, 30, 40 minutes from here.”
He looked questioningly at his
sports information director, and
continued, “They can take the sub-
way here.”

“Here” is Jamaica, a. suburb of
New York.

Mullin, a Brooklyn native who
could conceivably take the subway,
put out 21 points and 10 assists. He
said that both offensive statistics are
important, but given the choice, he
preferred making the assists.

“I would definitely Say the assists,
but having points is great, too. Scor-
ing off of somebody else’s pass
counts, and helping a teammate

Berry scored 17 points and added
eight rebounds, while teammate Bill
Wenningron contributed 16 points
and ll rebounds.

St. .Iohn’S is maintaining a rapid
pace on its trip to the NCAA
playoffs and an upset has been their
only stumbling block. Still, Carne-
secca refused to forecast a Sh0Wlr3".
at the Final Four in March.

“We still have to prove it. We
don’t have anything yet,” be main-
tained. “We won’t waltz our way to
the top; we’ll have to fight our way.”

Game Notes: Freshman Charles
Smith again led Pitt with 25 points
and seven rebounds. “Smith is well
on his way to becoming a superstar
in this league,” Carnesecca said.

Darryl Shepherd fouled out late
in the game after scoring l0 points
and grabbing 10 rebounds. Charles
Thompson added 10 points. . I

Curtis Aiken was 0-9 from the
field and 0-0 from the line. “It would
be an understatement to say that
Curtis is not shooting well,” Chip-
man said.

The 6,511 fans in attendance set
an Alumni Hall record.

Pitt was 25 of 65 (38.4 percent)
from the field and 12 of 20 from the
free throw line, while St. John's shot

  t. John’s paints
the Big Apple red

_-:_»

By Mary Wolf
The Pitt News

JAMAICA, N.Y. — New York,
New York, with its skyline, neon
lights, Broadway musicals and
str tcorner hucksters, has an urban
be ty and mystery unmatched by
any other city in the world. Just on

‘ the outskirts of this magnificent city
lies St. John’s University, the home
of another one of New York’s mar-
vels, the top-ranked college basket-
ball team in the nation.

It was Friday evening in Jamaica,
and the Pittsburgh Panthers were in
town once again to skirmish with the
team that presented the Panthers
with their worst Big East loss just a

. month earlier. St. John’s was on a
15- ame winning streak, and things
10 ed dismal for the Panthers even
before the onset ofthe game. But the
true Panther fans remained optimis-
tic. There was always the possibility
that Pittsburgh would have an
exceptionally good night or that St.
John’s would have an exceptionally
bad one.

“That Pitt team isn’t doing bad.
They’ve got a couple of strong
rebounders,” commented one New
York cabbie with a heavy Brooklyn
accent. “St John’s is vulnerable.
Good as they are, they’re always in
h water.”

Cab drivers may not be the most
reliable sources, but there were oth-
ers who believed that the Panthers
wouldn’t be such a pushover, includ-
ing St John’s star guard, Chris Mul-
lin. “They’ll be pretty fired up after

‘what happened last time,” added
Mullin before the game. “Their
freshmen are playing pretty good, so
w, an’t let down.”

At gametime,\St John’s Alumni
Hall was stuffed with over 6,500 fans
clad in red and waiting for some-
thing to cheer about. On the walls of
the gym were several banners. One
depicting Mullin slamming in a shot,
another reading “Redmen Fever”
and yet another bragging “The
Amazing Mullin. ” It didn’t take long
for an outsider to feel intimidated by
the overabundance of red.

It wasn’t the redness that menaceo

-tire Panthers as much as the skillful
tr‘:-.?mwork of Mullin and company.
Pitt kept ‘up with the Redmen only
for the first four minutes of play,
after which St. John’s held a com-
fortable lead for the remainder of
the game. Yes, the Redmen had
given their fans something to cheer
about early in the game, and by the
end of the first half the Panthers
were I3 points behind. The crowd,
while remaining supportive, had
quieted considerably —— winning has
become a habit for the Redmen.

Before the Panthers entered the
court to warm up for the second

half, they huddled in the corridor
outside the gym. A win over St.
John’s would not bejust another vic-
tory, and the Panthers searched for
strength from one another. Pitt
entered the court with a new found
momentum —— but it wouldn’t be
enough.

Although the Panthers were first
to score in the second half with a
layup from Charles Smith, it wasn’t
long before the Redmen once again
took control of the ball. With two
minutes remaining in the game, Pitt
was down by 19 and the crowd
began to chant, “We want Tree."
Redman freshman Ron Cornegy,
who stands 6-11, is affectionately
known by the St. John’s fans as
“Tree” for obvious reasons.

“He doesn’t play much,” said one
spectator. “The people just like him
because he does funny things out on
the court.”

Cornegy was sent into the game
for the last two minutes, and ironi-
cally enough, he ended up scoring
the Redmen‘s final two points.
Shortly thereafter, Pitt’s Marlon
Ferguson laid one up with 10
seconds left on the clock in a last-
ditch effort to narrow St John’s lead.
The final score was 84-63, and
although this loss was not as bad as



,.;v

the 31-point loss the Panthers suf-
fered in their first meeting with the
Redmen, it was just disappointing.

“Pitt did a good job on the
boards,” said Redmen guard Ron
Rowan after the game. Rowan, a
native of Beaver Falls, has made
some outstanding contributions to
the St. John's team since this
transfer from Notre Dame this year.

“Sure, I considered going to Pitt,”
admitted Rowan, “but I made the
choice to go to Notre Dame. I wasn’t
happy there, but I like it here. There
are a lot of great players. I’m fasci-
nated by the city."

Rowan is currently a junior and
will possibly be stepping into Mul-
lin’s shoes next year.

“Ron’s made a big contribution to
our game. It’s hard for anyone to
come in after Mullin,” stated Red-
men coach Lou Carnesecca follow-
ing the game. “Ron comes in when
the pan is frying. Our guards did a

tremendous job and really set the.

tempo tonight.”

St. John’s record for longest win-
ning streak is 18 games, which was
set in 1928-29. Tonight, the Redmen
will attempt to tie this record with a
win over No. 24 Boston College,
which would bring them to 13-0 in
Big East Conference play.

Gymnasts looking strong,
defeat Eastern Michigan

By Jace Palmer
The Pitt News

The men’s gymnastics team
emerged victorious this past Satur-
day, defeating the Hurons of East-
ern Michigan 268-220. One key
reason for the strong ‘Pitt showing
was the small squad Eastern Michi-
gan had. Huron head coach Marv
Johnson brought a mere seven
gymnasts. .

“They were definitely weak in
some of their events," stated Panther
head coach Frank D’Amico. “It was
clear that their guys were taking on
some events which they had little
experience in.” He added that this
-was most evident in the high bar
competition — one of the more dan-
gerous events. ,

The mark of a successfulteam in
almost any sport is the ability to fin-
ish strong near the end of the season.
Pitt is doing just that.

“The team as a whole has been
progressing as the weeks go by,” said
sophomore Mike Mealie. “By
improving our weaker events such as
pommel horse, our overall score
goes up.”

The Panthers accumulated scores
of 45 on rings and 46 on ﬂoor exer-
cise, with All-East junior Matt
Peters setting the school record with
an overall score of 56.45. Peter’s per-
formance on the high bars was out-
standing (two scores of 9.8),
although the squad as a whole
struggled in this event.

“Matt’s score was very good. If he
can do this in two weeks against
Ohio State it should boost his rank-
ing tremendously,” D’Amico said. “I
was very pleased with our 268 on
Saturday because this was what we
were shooting for.”

event. He added, however, ‘‘If the
guys can’t handleit, I'm not going to
let them. Some gymnasts try harder
routines just to ‘do it,’ but if we do
this, we'll do it to win.” -

As in previous meets, Pitt receive
a total team effort, as most of the
squad contributed to the scoring.
Sophomore Ben Rovee had one of
his best performances on the parallel
bars this year.

“I did better than I expected,” he
stated. “My warm-ups were not like
I wanted them to be, but once I went
out there, it all came together.”

Freshman standout Jorge San-
chez performed well on the floor
exercise and vaulting (two of his
strongest events), but still felt he
could have done better. “I’m really
looking forward to Slippery Rock
on Saturday because we should do
even better,” he said.

Without the absence of sopho-
more Keven Garren, the Panthers
may well have broken the 270 bar-
rier against Eastern Michigan.
Garren injured his shoulder two
weeks ago and has missed the past
two meets, but may see some action
when Pitt travelsto Slippery Rock
this Saturday.

“As soon as Kevin gets back, our
score should hit 270,” said junior
Jeff Shablin. “Hopefully, we can
break our school record next week
on the pommel horse.”

The Panthers are preparing for
Slippery Rock this week with the
sarne expectations they had about
‘Eastern Michigan. “They are just
about as competitive as the Hur-
ons,” echoed D’Amico. “We’re basi-
cally going to be competing against
ourselves and our scores.”

Wrestlers lose   to Bloomsburg,
looking ahead to Golden Eagles   

By Kirsten Gostony
The Pitt News ‘

In their last home match of the
season, the Panther wrestling squad
continued their dual meet struggle as
they were forced to forfeit three
weight classes and consequently
dropped to 22-ranked Bloomsburg-
State 33-ll. Pitt was able to field
only a seven-man team; however,
the team was able to win a majority
(four) of the seven matches.

“We were forced to give up a lot
through forfeits, and simply, it hurt
us,” explained coach Rande Stot-
tlemyer. “It’s almost depressing.”

From the very start of the match,
the Panthers were behind. Pitt's Joe
lagnema (I I8 lbs.) was unable to
wrestle due to a chest injury he sus-
tained against Penn State and John

Hnath (I26 lbs.) was out due to the
flu.

The first match was between
Panther Junior Kyle Nellis and
Bloomsburg opponent Phil Conner
at 134 lbs. Nellis was victorious by a

6-2 score. Earlier in the season, Nel-
lis defeated Conner in a bout that
went into overtime.

Bloomsburg’s Marty King (142
lbs.) recorded a fall over Rich Ess-
wein in a time of 3:52. After a fine
debut a week ago against Penn
State, Esswein got caught in a cou-
ple of King’s headlocks, which cost
him in points. «

Gary Boin continued his winning
drive by defeating Keith Voute, a
20-7 superior decision. “Bolin did a
super job,” said Stottlemeyer. “He’s
looking very strong as the E.W.L.
Championships draw near.
Whoever is going to beat him will
have to fight a very tough battle.”

Assistant coach Jack Spates
dubbed Doug Haines’ defeat of Dan
Klingerman the high point of the
meet. Haines pinned his opponent in
a time of 1203. Thus far, Haines had
beenqwrestling at 167 lbs., but Satur-

day he replaced an injured Bond. ‘.‘In H

terms of competing on the national
level, Haines is definitely a 158-
pounder, not a I67-pounder,”
explained Stottlemyer.

Mike Tongel, (167 lbs.) held on to
the lead he attained early in the

match to record a 9-7 victory over
Roger Leitzl. After the match, Ton-
gel received stitches from an injury
he sustained during the bout.

At 177 lbs., Bloomsburg’s Darren
Evans beat Dave Henninger 15-0, in
Henninger’s season debut. Hennincirj
gcr regularly wrestles at 167 lbs., and
was simply overmatched at the
higher weight. At 190 lbs., Panther
Curt Conner didn’t come to life until
the third period, but his spurt was
unsuccessful as he fell to Rich Gore-
zynski l3-l0.

, Tomorrow night the Panthers will
travel to Clarion to face the 15-
ranked Golden Eagles. Pitt isn’t
intimidated by their opponents
ranking: “We’re looking forward to
the match against‘Clarion, because ,5
honestly we have nothing to loose
and everything to gain,” said
Stottlemyer.

“We‘re all eagerly anticipating the

9 match," added Spates. “The match

will offer us an outstanding oppor-

tunity to show how far our wrestlers

have come in their individual
performances.”
