Professor
discusses

  Roe V.

  Wade

by  Honigman
Staff Writer -

The feminist movement of the
’60s and "7 Os revisited Pitt last week

Anne Fessler, an author and film-
maker, showed her documentary film

analysis of. the decades’ pregnancies, ”

adoptions and abortions in the Flick

7 Fine Arts building on Monday.

The yet—to—be~titled film was

I based on a non—fiction book she

‘wrote about women who put their

children up for adoption before A

abortion was legal. . e
Sex education was virtually ig-

nored in the United‘ States before .
the Supreme Court decision Roe V.
_ Wade legalized abortion in 1973, so V
F ' single women didn’t know what to

do when they found out they were
pregnant.  ‘

Fessler, whowas adopted, said she a *

wantedto reveal the “gap between
recorded history and lived l1ist0ry,’3
so she interviewed more than [100

'women who put their ‘children’ up

for adoption and compiled their ac-
counts into a book, "The Girls Who

.,Went Away. The Hidden" History of

Women Who Surrendered Children”
for Adoption in the Decades Before
Roe v. Wade” 1

~‘°I‘he mediums are conducive to

the story—telling,” said Fessler “I al-

ways thinlcit is  how one
person’s story is a microcosm for a

a larger issue.”

A “I wanted to really show how the

_ misrepresentations in the media [of

the ’6Os]4impacted  people in their
intimate relationships,” she said.
A -Fessler, avprofessor at the Rhode

, Island School of Design, didn’t al-
_ i ways want to write books or produce

ﬁlms on adoption. V _

exhibitions. Another woman at the event caught
her attention. 1.

-“I couldn’t remember where I saw her, and
I couldn’t remember when,” she said. “W/hen
I asked several people who she was, no one
knew.”
_ The mysterious woman approached Fessler
saying, “You could be my long—lost'daughter.

You look like the perfect combo of me and the I

father of my child.” -

Fessler and the other woman were both
speechless.

When they recovered from the shock, they
exchanged histories and realized they weren’t
mother  daughter. But Fessler spent the rest
of the night  to the woman and 
down her story. _» , T

“I knew I would make an art piece frofn it,”
she said, “Something that touched me person-

, ally, but having bigger social ramiﬁcations.”

Fessler began exploring her own adoption

for the first time. She grew up in Maumee,

Ohio, and discovered that the stream near the
town was one of three streams that fed the river S

near where her birth mother had lived. She was
then able’ to track down her biological mother.
“To actually meet the person grounds "you in
a reality,” said Fessler. “The process is important
because it gets rid of the secrecy, imagination
and the lies surrounding adoption’?
Fessler turned her experience into a short
ﬁlm called “Along the Pale Blue River.”
Five years ago, Fessler began working on
.her current documentary, but she was forced
to postpone it because she didn’t have enough
time to work on it and teach.

Fires off Pitt's campus prove harder to track

Fire, page 1
representatives —— plans to identify the best policies
and develop ﬁre safety protocol for schools to
follow The bill also includes a grant program to
help fund up—to—date ﬁre system projects
Although his department compiled the
statistics for the most recent years and the data
is available as the legislation requires, there is still
confusion about how and when to publish the
information, said Frerotte
“\X/e’re  for consensus,” he said.
“Some say we should proactively distribute the

information, and others say it should be available

by request”

He said he didn’t think there was any reason
why the information was not published before,
because his department already has the necessary
statistics

Pittsburgh ﬁre chief Darryl Jones said that he
thinks publishingioncampus ﬁre data is a good
idea. .

“If you’re aware a problem exists, then you
can take actions against that problem,” he said. “I
think it’s a good move The question is: Are people
 to use the information that is provided to
them?”

The legislation covers on—campus housing
facilities, but it doesn’t require universities to
publish statistics for ﬁres occurring off campus

Pitt does not keep records of ﬁres at off—'

campus properties, said Frerotte

‘Tm not sure the University would be able
to publish [off—campus ﬁre statistics],” said Jones
“I don’t know if they would  access to that
information. You don’t want to put too much on
the University —— the students and their parents
have to assume some of the responsibilities”

“Keeping track of off—campus housing, that
would be a monumental task,” he added.

Jones said the citfs Bureau of Building
Inspections and Pitt ofﬁcials conducted inspections
of off—campus housing, some of which occurred
during the summer '

In May, The Pitt News reported that two ,

McKee Place buildings, owned byJason Cohen,

\ were not up to ﬁre safety codes and were deemed .
unlivable by the Bureau

Frerotre conﬁrmed that Pitt representatives
attended the inspections for “support and
participation” but clariﬁed that the city, not the

University, has authority over landlords There
is nothing in the legislation that would  a V. A

property owner to report episodes to Pitt, he said
The Center for Campus Fire Safety, a nonproﬁt

organization that advocated for the legislation and‘

trains university ﬁre oﬂicials, published ﬁre fatality
statistics on its Web site, .wwwcampusﬁ_resafety.

with 76 victims, occurred in’o£f—<:ampus housing,

while six occurred in on—campus buildings,

At Pitt, several small ﬁres have occurred on
campus since 2000, but the ﬁres that killed students
have all been off—campus

An accidental apartment ﬁre at 3420 Louisa St
in South Oakland in 2006 killed one Pitt student,
while another ﬁre earlier that year on Meyran
Avenue killed a 20-year-old man, who did not
go to Pitt, and   student
apartments — -

In ?I)02, an arsonist killed a Pitt student 
on North Craig Street, according to articles from

‘The Pitt News from that year.

Jones said that carelessness often puts students
at a greater risk for ﬁres than other tenants and

-~ that sometimes students will compromise safety

Political Fosinti-Counterpoint: Assessing the ﬁnancial crisis

Loam? and mortgaged cl/‘6_I”li0f candy

by ShaneiLevy
Colum/uidz‘

Over the past six months, the United
States has seen unprecedented and
previously unimaginable developments
in the ﬁnancial sector. ‘

In March 2008, Bear Stearns, which

i was previously one of the world’s largest

investment banks, collapsed as a result

of the widespread subprime mortgage.

crisis. The subprime mortgages and
credit crisis that led to the downfall
of Bear Stearns would strongly impact
other large ﬁnancial institutions, as well.

Within the past month, Fannie Mae
and Freddie Mac, two of the United

‘States’ largest" mortgage lenders, ’were»
put under conservatorship of the federal ,

/

government.’ A

A Lehman Brothers, an . American
institution for more -than 150 years, ﬁled
for the largest Chapter‘ 11 bankruptcy
in‘Am’erican history. The sale of Merrill

Lynch, the largest investment-banking‘ r

ﬁrm inthe United States, to Bank‘ of
America followed this event. The events
of 2008 have completely reshaped the
face of Wall Street, in what some pundits
call the worst economic crisis since the
Great Depression. ’

_ This past week, Bush introduced an
initiative that would inject $700 billion
into" the economy in order to buy the
mortgage-backed securities and other
faulty securities that have been some of

» the most signiﬁcant causes of the United _

States’ severe economic woes. Although
Bush’s presidency has been marred by
poor foreign and domestic policy, his

 

quickly, more deliberation" is critical
for such a consequential decision that
would signiﬁcantly affect the lives of
every American taxpayer.

Democrats
of Congress contend that the United
States government should . demand a
premium —— speciﬁcally, a stake in any
of the ﬁnancial institutions that are
participating in the bailout. This move
would pro‘Ee‘ct the American people
from assuming all ofythe risk involved
in such a monumental effort. A »

Doing this would. effectively limit
the »ultimate cost that.the ‘American
taxpayers would have to pay by allowing
the government the opportunity N to

"regain, some of the capital yloaned

In the wake of the economic
bombshell that burst on Wall ._Street

prominent ﬁnancial and insurance houses,

V Americans are left wondering what their

are experiencing is more systemic than
Obama would like to admit. Corporations
created by the government, such as

are now trying to control. However, it is
Qbama’s conviction that we need to create
more of the same, kind of entitlements

it will not build up more government

the present. His plans for reform are not

Bipartisanship necessary to pullbailout plan out of limbo i

EI)ITORIAL —

Success of plan depends on continued cooperation from both parties in Congress

President George W Bush
met- _with leading Congressio-

nal Republicans and Democrats“

yesterday, including presiden-
tial candidates Sen. John Mc-
Cain and Sen. Barack Obama, in
hopes that leaders couldreach a
bipartisan agreement on a bail-
out plan to help rescue the na-
tion’s struggling economy.

At this moment of ﬁnan—'

cial ‘crisis, Democrats and Re-
publicans showed the country’s
strength in coming. together
to try and solve the problem.
Bush’s leading of the meeting
in a bipartisan fashioniwas are-

would not taint efforts at pulling
the nation out of this economic
emergency. '

But while the president hoped
that Congressional leaders could
reach an agreement on the plan
after the meeting, many House
Republicans were hesitant. Mc-
Cain,‘who put his campaign on
hold to deal with the crisis, did
not endorse the plan.

Chairman of the Senate
Banking Committee Sen. Chris
Dodd, D - Conn., told The New

_ York Times that the delays made

the whole effort seem like “a
rescue plan for John McCain,”

economy.

Initially, House and Senate
officials announced that they
had agreed upon a $700 billion
deal, which would -allow govern-
ment intervention to a degree
that the United States has never
before experienced. The plan
would authorize the government

to buy bad debt from private

ﬁrms in an effort to prevent an
economic catastrophe.

But Republicans soon ex-
pressed their concerns that such
unprecedented government
interference went against the
_standards of a free market econ-

As of press time, they had yet
to reach an agreement. 4

\While the resolution . of
this plan is still in question, it

is nonetheless reassuring that A

Congressional officials ‘have ﬁ-

nally acknowledged the ﬁnancial’ ‘

problem and have, at. the very

least, come so far in ﬁnding a ~

solution. Republicans may be
taking their time, but their delays
are also crucial in eventually de-

-veloping .a plan that both sides

can agree on.

In particular,iBush, who has
usually taken a “hands-off.” ap-
proach when it comes to the

$700 billion bailout plan, a sur-

‘ prising willingness to step out-

side party lines.

His efforts are necessary
because the failing state of the
economy is partly his fault. The
Bush administration has been
responsible for cutting regula-
tions, making it difﬁcult for the
government to stay informed of
the actions of ﬁrms.

We remain cautious about the
success of this deal and hope
that the two parties can soon
reach an agreement -—-— one that
will not only aid in ﬁnally ending
the ﬁnancial crisis, but also help

' "assuring sign that party politics omy. economy, has shown, with his unify.the country.

But no iwonies: Dead Confederate sounds con— A '

temporary more often than not.
I mean,  often do you get to hear a song
titled ‘i/‘ill The Angels” that startsoff with an in-
tro thafs nothing short of ttippy? .
' And right after that, “Start Me  ”
starts off with a screaming metal feel. Dead‘
Confederate deﬁnitely keeps the songs varied
and neat; you’re never sure what theyll decide to
throw to the listeners next.
But even Dead Confederate has its soft side.

“It Was A Rose” reveals a whole other side of .
I its composition skills, as singer Hardy Morris

cries, “This sweet encounter / Is it a ﬂower / Is it

pretty / Is it a rose?”

Thesinger declares, “I was crazy / Andiin

love, too.” We have the classic mistake of love

even among the hardcore sounds of the band

We also have the classic broken man 
in the last song  the same name as the al-
bum, when the focus is on a man And appar-
ently, “God knows he’s seen it all / Been hit by a
 ball.”

Now, we know the album is complete: Love
and broken ﬁgures are the requirements for any
good rock-oiiented album. I “

The only downside is that lyﬁc fans might
have a hard time  Morris’ throaty Voice

Still, the music is worth the ‘sound, and it

Dixon on board

by Mike Gladysz
Sparta Editor

Pitt men’s basketball coach Jamie P

Dixon thought -he’d have a nice, relax-

ing day with his wife on her birthday.
Turns out he had to head to work
to discuss something: the three—year
contract extension he signed that be-

var-;tne official yesterday.

' His wife likely won’t be too upset _
I Pitt athletic director Steve Peder-

son announced yesterday the contract '

extension, which will keep Dixon on
the Pitt sidelines through the 2015-16
season.

“Jamie did not ask for a contract
extension,” said Pederson during
a press conference at the Petersen
Events Center. “This is the result of
our desire to keep this dynamic bas-

*'i’:r':tball program on solid footing for
years to come.” 1

Dixon said that Pederson ap-
proached him eaflier in the month,
saying he wanted to keep Dixon on
the Pitt sidelines for a while longer.
W’ Dixon’s response came 

“I said ‘OK,’ and we went off to
lunch,” he said.

Entering his sixth season as head i

coach and his 10th season overall,
Dixon led Pitt to a 27-10 record anda
"Big East tournament title last season.
Pitt also reached the NCAA‘ Tour-
nament for the seventh ‘consecutive
W313 ,
That caught Pedersotfs attention.
“In a-short time,_lamie has risen to
ifﬁe very top of his profession,” said
Pederson. ' .
Still, Dixon said the extension

doesn’t alter a whole lot besides job
security. - _,

“It doesn’t really change what
we’re  to do as a team,” said
Dixon. “[But] it does mean a?lot.

. They made a tremendous commit-

ment to me.” _ ‘ .
W/itlri a 132-40 record, Dixon
holds the best  percentage for
a Pitt head coach after five years of
service.vHe’s led Pitt to five seasons
with 20 or more wins, and he reached

x100 victories faster than any coach in

school history. _ ‘
Both Pedersonand Dixon said

they think those numbers will con-

tinue to climb.
“[We] both believe the best days

. for Pitt basketball lay ahead,” said

Pederson. 1
Dixon said the extension will also
help Pitt  recruiting. It also means

' he won’t have to worry about looking

for another job — something college
coaches recently have been worrying

' about more and more.

“I don’t want toispend my time or

Pitt ready for Orange 

- by Jay Huerbin‘
I ‘Stay? Writer

With‘ a series dating back to
1916, the Pittsburgh Panthers
(2-1) will take on the Syracuse
Orange (1-3) tomorrow in a game
that officially kicks eff the Big
East season for both teams. ~ '

Following last week’s victory
over Big Ten opponent Iowa,
head coach Dave Wannstedt
knows the team is getting better,

,but it still has work to do.

“Last week we had a nice win,”
said Wannstedt during this week’s

pressconference. “But we’re still’

not doing things as wellas we’d
like and _as well as I think we’re

capable of. It was a win, andAI ‘
think we can learn from that g

After two solid outings _to sfart
the season, Stull saw his throwing

improvement. will come from
quarterback Bill Stull and the

line and Stull progressed well
against Iowa.

“We only gave up two sacks,”
said Wannstedt of the offense.
“And they were sort of protection
sacks where, rather than throwing
the ball in a dangerous situation,
we held onto it rather than risk
the turnover.”

Defensively, the Panthers will
see strong safeties Dom DeCicco
and Elijah Fields split time against
the Orange. ' ‘

Wannstedt liked the
contributions of both players

V and thought their development

warranted more playing time.

At the linebackerl position,
the coaching staff hopes to give
Shane _Murray more playing time
than he saw against Iowa. Austin
Ransom started for the third time
last week, while Murray continued

I to recuperate from his nagging

kneeinjury. ‘ ,
“Austin deserved. to be
the starter after the —way he’s
progressed,” said Wannstedt.
“Shane is close to being 100
percent, so we’ll evaluate him this

. week in p’ractice.’’/ ,
As Pitt prepares for its first Big ‘

East matchup of the season, the
team realizes that it cannot take
anything lightly. Having won only
four times in the past 14 games at
the Carrier Dome, tradition may
not be on Pitt’s side.

After starting the season O-3,

Syracuse is coming off a win‘

against Northeastern.
“When you look at Syracuse,

they had a nice win on Saturday,” «

said Wannstedt. “I think that
if‘ you look at their history and‘
tradition up there and playing at
the Carrier Dome, we’ll have a lot
of work to do.”

The Orange enter tomorrow’s‘
game with junior quarterback-
Cameron Dantley as the starter.

Dantley replaced fellow junior '

Andrew Robinson after Syracuse’s
opening loss at Northwestern.
Dantley, who is fifth in the
Big East in quarterback rating,
has settled into the position.

. Although Syracuse’s quarterback

situation was expected to be a

- week—by—week decision, Daritley

has started every game after the,

I opener. _ '

“I thought [Dantley] played
well last week,” said Syracuse

 Fresh off a 21-20 win over Iowa last
piweek, the Pitt Panthers travel to Syracuse to-
morrow for the team’s first road game of the
if season, as well as its opening Big-East affair.

 A Pitt can improve to 3-1 with a victory
over the Orange. The contest is set for a

 game.
,. .
 Tom, from Shadyside, asked, “Who is
 the key defensive player this weekend at
 the ‘Cuse?’’ , _ _ ‘
 Mike Gladysz: The key defensive player
 for Pitt this week will be the Syracuse of-
" fense, which will likely stop itself.

 Seriously, though, the defensive line will
 be important again this week. The Syracuse
 running game isn’t'bad, and if it can keep the
 Pitt defense on the ﬁeld, it might be able to
 tire it out.. Still, I don’t see Syracuse putting

 up too ‘many points.

iiWill McCoy and Ste

 

The Pitt News  www.pittnews.com

Zack Chakan: Syracuse hasn’t done

' much through the air, so rushing the passer

early will be key for the Pitt defensive line.

Greg Romeus showed signs of life last
week and could be ready to break outwith a
few sacks between the Orange’s tackles.

Tony, from Mt.. Washington, said,
“Both running backs i have been pro-
ductive this year. Any chance Pitt will
use both LaR0d Stephens-Howling and
LeSean McCoy in the backﬁeld at the
same time? Especially since both backs
have had success against the Orange?”

MG: I’d love to say yes,’ but I can’t..
I haven’t seen enough out of Matt Ca-
vanaughs play-calling to make me believe
Pitt  try anything crazy with McCoy and
Stephens—I_-lowling. It is a great idea, though,
and it would really throw a different look at
the defense. »

Both backs have the ability to make the’

big play, and either back could‘, start a lot of
different schools. Still, the offense has more
important things to worry about than a two-
back set  like throwing the ball down the
field. , i ‘

ZC: This sounds like a great‘ idea for the
Pitt offense to employ, but I’m not sure this is
the week to "pull it out. I think Dave Wannst—

Pitt, Steelers headed   S

in opposite directions.

by Zack Chakan
Adazlrtant Sparta Editor

 

Two Pittsburgh football teams
received extreme makeovers last weekend.
Unfortunately, only one of them came out
looking better than before.

The way these games were played, it might

_ have been easy to predict the ﬁnal scores, with
one Pittsburgh squad winning and the other
losing. " . '

One game ‘featured a ﬂea—flicker, a reverse,
a..shovel pass, trick‘ _formations and timely
defensive stops. ' l

The other highlighted horriﬁc offensive

-’_line play, questionable decisions by the

quarterback and mediocre coaching at best.

Who would’ve thought the latter example
described the Steelers losing to the Eagles,
15-6, while the Panthers looked decidedly
superior against Iowa? ‘

The Stcelers are supposed to be the
club that runs crazy plays, like lining up
two quarterbacks in the backﬁeld and then
sending one of them in motion, resulting in a
quarterback draw for a touchdown.

’‘ The Steelers are supposed to be the team
that blows through the opposing offensive

line for a sack, and then follows that up with a _

forced fumble to seal a victory.
The Steelers are supposed to be the squad

with one of the greatest coaching staffs in ‘

football. ‘ 

Meanwhile, the Panthers are usually
criticized for lack of imagination and capable
leadership. I

" Did Alfred Hitchcock formulate this twist?

V   Abrams? Martin Scorsese?

Regardless, both team’s performances last
week could be critical for the remainder of
their seasons. '

That’s great for the Panthers, but not so
great.f_or the Steelers. I ‘

Pitt’s Dave Wannstedt and Matt Cavanaugh
took plenty of heat from fans following the
ﬁrst two games of the season, particularly after

Pitt fell in a major upset at home to Bowling

Green on the ﬁrst day of the season.

Pitt;’s pro—style offense didn’t produce
much against Bowling Green and Buffalo.
Star. running back LeSean McCoy couldn’t
ﬁnd  room, and quarterback Bill Stull
was rarely, if at all, asked to throw farther‘ than
10 yards. A '

Opposing defenses would load the box‘
and dare Pitt to go long. Pitt wouldn’c And I

there wasn’t an indication that something
would change. .,.~

Greg Cross’ hadn’t touched the ‘ﬁeld;
Jonathan Baldwin was targeted once per

game. V -
But Wannstedt and Cavanaugh gave the
offense a much—needed shot of Botox against
Iowa.

1 Cross and Stull were in the backﬁeld as '
part of a new formation that the coaches

unveiled. Cross’ ﬁrst play at Pitt_was a 17-yard 

touchdown sprint. _
Stull almost I completed a ﬂea—ﬂicker, 5
which caught Iowa off—guard. Aundre Wright A
surprised the Hawkeyes on a reverse. McCoy 
broke a long gain on a shovel pass. j
Coincidentally, the Pitt offense was 
most productive in the midst of these plays. V
Granted, for two quarters, conservatism ruled ‘

ball. .
If Wannstedt and Cavanaugh continue to 3

open up, the Panthers could challenge for the 

title in the weak Big East. Crazier things have 3
happened. _ ’ L,
Meanwhile, the Steelers’ offense showed f

A some ominous and potentially fatal ﬂaws 

while getting smacked by the Eagles..

The offensive line stuck out. Ben :‘

Roethlisberger was sacked eight times, and

backup Byron Leftwich was hauled down‘?
once after Roethlisberger left in the fourth.

quarter  an 
‘Somehow, I it could’ve been worse. .
Roethlisbergcr was constantly flushed out of 3

the pocket and forced to throw balls away. i-

Philadelphia s/demingly blitzed on every’ play,
and the line had absolutely no answers all day. j
With yearly Pfo Bowler_oAlan Faneca in 

New York, the Steelers’ offensive line hasn’t 

jelled. Faneca’s replacement, Chris Kemoeatu,

has been inconsistent and was easily rattled 

last week. Kendall Simmons is getting old.l

Willie Colon has struggled mightily at right 

tackle. Marvel Smith and Justin Hartwig have 
to anchor the unit. 3’

Equally as bad, Pittsburgh’s coaching staff 
A failed to adjust to the Eagles’ all—out attack. 
Offensive coordinator _Bruce Arians didn’t 1,.
call enough screen plays or three—step drop 

passes to break? the blitzes.

But the skill—posi1ion players didn’t help 
much, either. Willie Parker had no running '

lanes, and the receivers couldn’t get open.

‘ If these problems aren’t corrected, the

wonderful Steelers defense could A go " to 

waste. Luckily, the AFC North is" so bad that 
Pittsburgh could go 9-7 andwin the division.

edt and Cavanaugh dabbled with this idea in

-camp, but we’ve yet to see it on the ﬁeld.

My guess is that it will happen when the
coaches feel the situation dictates it. This
type of formation could bring the same type
of confusion to a defense thatilast week_’s

MG: I can’t see it happening. The Syra— ,

cuse football program is falling apart. Actu-

ally, it’s been apart for a while now. But this

team is dropping, and dropping fast. The
coaching staff will likely be gone at the end
of this year, and players know it.

The players don’t match up with the Pitt

if Pitt might be able to put up some big points.

no, but this is Pitt we’re talking about.
Pitt only beat Syracuse on its home turf

by three points last year, and this is largely
‘the same Orange squad. The Panthers have

also had trouble in the Carrier Dome in years
past. But Piti: should be much improved, and
Syracuse has severely regressed. Even Akron
beat Syracuse by two touchdowns in Orange,
country. Even if it’s a low—scoring game, Pitt
should win by at least two _touchdowns.
