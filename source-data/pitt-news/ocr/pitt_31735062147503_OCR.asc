Postman Takes Chancellor’s Duty, .
Will Present Diplomas In February

 

Seniors who plan to graduate in
February can toss their dreams of the
impressive graduation ceremony into
the discard. The University admin-
istration has announced that mid-
will be

to all graduates instead of the usual.
elaborate ceremony and speeches that
accompany graduation.

The purpose of the new plan is to

save the time of most of the graduates
who are teachers in local schools.
Previously it was necessary for the
graduate to obtain leave from his po-
sition in order to receive the sheep-
skin at the mid-term commencement.

All graduates who wish to have

their diplomas presented at a cere-

mony may leave them at the Univer-
sity and receive the diploma at the
elaborate ceremonies at the Stadium
in June.

Previous to the new ruling the
graduation exercises were held in
Memorial Hall. - Last year 188 degrees;
were conferred.

Former ‘February commencements
have brought many notables to the
University including, Dr. Lynn Harold
Hough, dean of Drew Theological
Seminary; Dr. Harold Glenn Moulton,
president of the Brookings Institution
of Vvashington, D. C.; John M. Fitz-

gerald, prominent railway executive; -

John Fisher, former governor of
Pennsylvania; and Mel Thorpe, editor.

Druids Prepare
To Tap Two Men

Committee Investigating Revision
Of Constitution Set Up

Druids, national sophomore hon-
orary fraternity, is preparing to tap
two advanced freshman men at the
beginning of the semester.

In connection with the tapping pro-
cedure, a committee has been ap-
pointed to investigate constitutional
revision, with a view toward possibly
adopting a revised system of electing
new members. It was suggested that
the method employed by ODK might
show to advantage over the procedure
now in use.

The committee for constitutional
revision consists of James Dattillo,
C38, Herbert‘ Rackoff, C38, and
Andrew Moffatt, C38.

In preparation for the coming tap-
ping, Frank Engel, E38, president, has
appointed committees to work with
him in preparting the nominations. To
investigate the grades of candidates,
Rackoff, Dattillo, David Grossman, C38,
and Stephen Goodale, C38, have been
appointed.

Assisting Engel in interviewing the
candidates will be Joseph Morrow,

C38, -Frank Souchak, C38, Alex--Will- «

son, C38, and John“ Baker,‘ BA38.

Present Druid plans call for a tea
dance within the next six weeks, with
Paul Kohberger, C38, as chairman. As-
sisting him are Theodore Whitaker,
C38, Samuel Werlinick, C38, and
Baker.

According to D. C. Schultz, C38, in
charge of organizing a national con-
vention of Druids, the probability of
such a meeting has been increased
during the past month. Other chap-
ters in the East and South are in
favor of it, as a method of strengthen-
ing and of expanding the national or-
ganization. Chapters at Penn State,
Alabama, and Franklin and Marshall
were noted as particularly active.

Dent Council Hop
Has Competition

Quax-Collembolae, Riﬂes Dances
Rival Interfraternity Affair

Besides Friday the thirteenth, the
Dental Interfraternity Council’s an-

'nual dance will have to compete with

the Pitt Riﬂes and Quax-Collembolae
affairs on the same evening.

Nevertheless, the three co-chair-
men, Daniel Lonberger, D36, president
of Psi Omega; Charles McMechan,
D36, president of Delta Sigma Delta;
and Zelly Alpert, D36, president of A1-
pha Omega, have scheduled the Uni-
versity Club ballroom for December
13.

Jack Mason’s orchestra, which has
provided the music for several Uni-
versity dances and Carnegie Tech and
Bucknell proms, will provide the
rhythm.

Tickets, at $2 a couple, may be ob-
tained from members of the commit-
tee, which includes James Goldblum,
Jack Bailey, and Eugene Engelskir-
ger. The affair is open to all Univer-
sity students.

A Profs Ace?  

Try The University Bridge Club

Tuesday afternoon, for‘ many stu-
dents and faculty members, always
means bridge club day—even as it
does for scores of Pittsburgh matrons,
Pottsville matrons, and women young
Yes, everywhere.
Rumor has it that in the far reaches
Of Alaska. the new pioneering settlers
have organized their regular weekly
Tuesday bridge clubs at which w11a1e
meat, garnished with parsley, is
served.

Nothing will be served tomorrow
afternoon in Room 704, Cathedral, ex-
cept bridge.

The Bridge Club, in its second year
under the aegis of President Leonard
Seder, C37, has been meeting regular-
ly each Tuesday featuring a mixture
of experts and dubs in the intricacies
of contract and duplicate bridge.
Those who attend claim they have

fun, especially in trumping profess-
crial aces.

Club meetings are open to student
and faculty bridge players without
charge.

Seder announces that the Club next
month will conduct a duplicate tourna-
ment between faculty and student
teams, with 20 players on each side,
scheduled for January 15. Positions
are still to be won on the student
team, says the president.

Last week, in a tournament among
student members of the organization,
Clarence Schultz and C. A. Anderson
won first honors, followed by Sam
Lucas and Emest Trapp, William
Sprague and Arthur S_achs, Helen
Schein and Ethel Roth, and Richard
Calloman and Stanley Markey, with
the last named two teams tying for
fourth place.

A match with a team from Carnegie
Tech is tentative.

Inquiry To Hear’ A 
Talk On Jobless:
  Relief Problems

“What the Unemployed Think About
the Relief Problem” will be discussed
by Robert Lieberman, chairman of the
Unemployed Citizens’ League of Alle-
gheny County, at the Inquiry Forum
Wednesday during ﬁfth hour in Room
107, Alumni Hall. /

Lieberman, who is leader of the
largest unemployed “pressure” group
in the county and one of the largest
in the state, returned from a state-
wide conference of jobless in Harris-
burg Saturday.

As chairman of the League, he has
been prominent in negotiations with
relief and WPA officials in Harris-
burg and Washington during the past
few years in an attempt to secure bet-
ter relief standards and, more recent-
ly, fairer WPA working conditions.

According to Katherine : Monori,
C36, co-chairman of Inquiry, “Lieber-
man is one of the ablest leaders of the
unemployed movement in the state,
and is thoroughly familiar with the
relief and WPA problems, both in
their set-up and relation to jobless
men and women.”

by a two-thirds vote, shall have the
power to override decisions of the
Supreme Court making legislation
of Congress unconstitutional.”

Albert Brandon, C36, a11d Frank
Doeringer, C36, comprise the Uni-
versity team, which will take the
affirmative side.

There will be no decision on the
arguments presented, according to
Israel Goldberg, C36, intercollegiate
debating manager. An open forum
will be held afterwards.

ly Bulletin, “This shows both the time-
liness of the subject and that the pub-
lie is interested.”

Shifts in The Bituminous Coal Indus-
try,” and will have a special refer-
ence to Pennsylvania.

Fraternity Songs
To Precede Dance

Semi-Annual I-F Affair Arranged
For Next Monday" Evening

The semi-annual Interfraternity sing
is to be held Monday night, December
16, as the ﬁrst part of the “Interfra-
ternity Yuletide Festival, Sing and
Dance.” The singing is to be from 9
to 10- o’clock with dancing until 2
o’clock.

Bill Schenck, BA37, is chairman of
the general committee and stresses es-

pecially the fact that it is imperative
for all fraternity sing teams to be
present promptly at 9 o’clock. At that
time the fraternity names will be
drawn out of a hat to determine the
order in which they will sing. Any
team not present at the time of draw-
ing automatically forfeits its right to
compete.

Jimmy Bray’s orchestra has been
obtained for the dance at the Schen-
ley Hotel Ballroom. The price is $1.50
and the affair is informal.

Each fraternity will sing two songs,
one fraternity song and one song of
its own choosing. N. Robert Seidle,
assistant to the dean of men, suggests
that in keeping with the Yuletide spir-
‘it the second song should be -the fra-
ternity’s arrangement of a Christmas
caroh

Tickets are on sale now at the dean
of men’s office; from Mr. Daufenbach
in Alumni Hall; and from the mem-
bers of the committee who are
Schenck, Phi Gamma Delta, chair-
man; Charles Roofner, Theta Chi, bus-
ness manager; Don Pritchard, Delta
Tau Delta; James Shields, Kappa Sig-
ma; Chris Harris, Lambda Chi Alpha;
Sam Anderson, Phi Delta Theta; Arn-
old Hirsh, Phi Epsilon Pi; Al Barr,
Phi Kappa; Bill Fox, Pi Kappa Alpha;
Raymond Ehrman, Pi Lambda Phi;
Jack Bodkin, Sigma Alpha Epsilon;
Ben Baskin, Sigma Alpha Mu; Wil-
liam Mathias, Sigma Xi,

Delta Tau Delta, with its arrange-
ment of "‘Delta Shelter,” has carried
off ﬁrst honors at the last three sings
held within the last two years. '

An institute on social workers’
problems will be conducted at the

Easly In New York

Mr. H. F. Easly, custodian of sup-
plies in the chemistry department is
in New York attending the Fifteenth
Exposition of Chemical Industries.

The exposition was held this year
at Grand Central Palace, New York,

Pul: Up Your Swords!
Put Up Your Rifles!

A headline in Friday's issue of
The Pitt News, boxed to add dis-
play value to the story itself, an-
nounced a dance this Friday night
sponsored by Scabbard and Blade
(honorary military science frater-
nity).

The story itself declared that Pitt
Rifles, another honorary group in
the ROTC department, was «__sponsor-
ing the affair.

Not desiring to suffer divers
wounds from hand grenades, pis-
tols, bayonets, or trench mortars
handled by the members of both
groups, The News hastens to make
correction. Pitt Rifles is running
the dance. '

The error was, of course, perpe-
trated by our printers. Sure.

sored annually by the Press, the pro-
ceeds. of which go to the Home for
Crippled Cliildr-en. This is the ﬁrst
year that the University has partici-
pated in this event.

Stinchcomb Flays
Outmoded System

Tells New York Group Teachers
Disregard Mbdern Methods

It is the opinion of Dr. James B.
Stinchcomb, assistant professor of
classics, that the modern college pro-
fessor has no regard for the teachings
of modern education.

In a lecture Saturday before a New
York audience consisting of many

"prominent ﬁgures in literary and edu-

cational circles, he stressed this view.
The occasion was the celebration of
the two—thousandth anniversary of the
birth of the Roman poet, Horace. Dr.
Stinchcomb spoke on “Horace in Six-
teen Vveeks” at a meeting of the New
York Classical Club in Casa ltaliana,
Columbia University. ,

The address was a survey of the
courses given in American colleges on
the works of Horace. revealing the
general lack of attention to peda-
gogical standards even in those col-
leges which put most emphasis on
methods of teaching.

“College professors. noisy in their
criticism of the teaching of the sec-
ondary schools,” said Dr. Stinchcomb,
“obstinately and ignorantly refuse to
listen to the many lessons which
modern education holds for them.
Courses are organized with no regard
for the capacities or interests of _the
students and have not changed since
medieval times . . . After all our ex-
amination of the art of teaching and
all our attention to the improvement
of instruction in the lower schools,
we still ﬁnd that college professors
are both unaware of the possibility of
improving their. effectiveness as
teachers and scornful of the lessons
which modern pedagogy can teach
them.” _

Dr. Stinchcomb gave another lecture

on Horace last week before an assem-
bly of the Bridgeville High School.

Presents
To SFA

Monthly Session
Tomorrow Open
To Student Body

Committee On Committees, Formed
To Plan Possible Assembly
Program, Gives Report

 

 

“The most important SFA meeting
of the year” is scheduled for tomor-
row evening in Room 801, Cathedral.
Students are invited to attend the
session, which is scheduled for 7:30
o’clock. '

Proceedingscf the meeting, it is
expected, will shape the policies of
the student governing organization
during the remainder of the school
year. A 22-point program -presented
by the Committee on Committees will
provide suggestions for future activi-
ties. « A .- ‘

Chairman of the committee, Israel
L. Goldberg, C36, will present the re-
port of his group, which includes Miss
Thyrsa W. Amos, dean of women,
Charles B. Holstein, C36, Ruth Sha-
piro, C37, and Charles W. Herald, C36.

“We are not trying to set an all-
time high for number of points in our
program," Goldberg said after the
committee had met. “We do feel,
however, that each of the ideas we
shall suggest to the Assembly is
worth discussion and further investi-
gation.”

Prominent among the proposals put
forward by the group, will be one fav-
oring frequent Friday assemblies in
which such activities as the Glee Club
and Pitt Players may»appe“ar--before
the student body. Another sugges-
tion is put forward to engage nation-
ally-known speakers for campus
forums. A speakers’ committee would
arrange the events. '

May Poll Student Opinion

An Educational Policies committee
is also proposed. Innovations such as
courses in musical appreciation would
be introduced. It is planned, too, to
appoint a'*co“rn-mittee for student opin-
ion, which would attemptitolkeep pace
with undergraduate thought on cur-
rent issues. Results would be printed
in campus publications.

The committee further will report
that High School Days should be
separate from Spring Festival Week,
and that a High School Speakers’ bu-
reau should keep in touch with Go-to--
College clubs in the district.

A permanent body publicizing ex--

change and University scholarships-.

available to students would be a de---

sirable innovation, the group will!
maintain.

Other proposals include re.introduc--
Iion of the University newsreel on,.
rather than off-campus; plans for
Scholastic Tap Day and a spring
Peace Assembly; discussion of organs
ization by classes; book exchange
work begun i11 spring; and appoint-
ment of a committee to remove the
School of Pharmacy from its isolated
position in campus life.

Tomorrow’s. the third monthly meet.-
ing of the Student-Faculty Assembly,
will also feature reports of the cus-
toms committee led by Herald and
the ﬁfth hour committee under Lois
Follsnsbee, C37. William. Harvey,
C36, chairman of the executive com-
mittee, will present his report.

Gem Display Includes Rare
Jade Prayer Wheel, Agate

 

By William Murray

Many new gems from all over the
world have been purchased by the de-
partment of geology and added to the
Smith Collection, Henry Leighton,
head of the department of geology, has
announced. These stones are now on
display on the twelfth ﬂoor of the
Cathedral.

Perhaps the most unusual object
in the collection is a piece of white
nephrite jade, carved in the shape of
a. Chinese prayer-wheel, in which the
center wheel revolves. The piece is
about two inches in diameter and is
very intricately out. A small cat.
also of white jade, rests 011 a tiny
black pedestal.

A large slice of agate, which has.

been cut into sections, stained with
various colors, and remounted shows
a wide variety of color patterns. The
agate. about half an inch thick, is
especially rare because the secret pro-
cesses used in the staining have been
lost.

Another interesting stone in the col-'

lection is a small cut white zircon.
The white zircon. rarely found, has a
diamond-like brilliance, which is due

to its high index of refraction. A blue
and a brown zircon, also displayed,
have been brought from Siam.

Among the other precious gems
added to the Smith collection are a
star ruby, several beautiful black
opals from Australia, an unusually
light emerald intergrown with quartz
from Mo”bo, Columbia, and a ﬁre opal
from Mexico. A small bar of amber,
containing an imbedded insect, is
shown with a large piece of raw am-
ber taken from the Baltic region and
polished. There is also a specimen of
periodotite, the “blue earth” or rock
in which the diamonds are found at
liimberley, South Africa.

M1‘. David Seaman, graduate stu-
dent iu geology, has presented the de-
partment with a ﬁne crystal of aqua-
marine beryl he obtained in Portland,
Connecticut. It is a huge rock of blue-
green.

Because of the interest in the
famous Yunkers diamond, recently ex-
hibited in a downtown jewelry store.
Mr. Leighton is exhibiting:models of
other famous large diamonds, includ-
ing the Orloff, and a number of small
diamond crystals.

HAT IS BEING prophesied as the “biggest meeting

of the.yea.r” is on_the books for the Student Faculty
Association tomorrow night. Manyof those -who are
keenly- interested in the success of the University's stu-
dent government-are delighted to hear that prophecy and
will be more delighted to see it hold true.

The 'S_FA group as- has been said before, is somewhat
on they-spot.~ Being a: new organization last year", every
minute bitof organization orpolicy prepared then was

It is true, nevertheless that SFA should very soon b.e
getting off the mark and started down the track. The
organization has done some work concerning the aboli-
tion of ﬁfth hour. classes and that stands as its most
notable undertaking. Virtually all of the remaining SFA

Tomorrow night the committee on committees will
present’ a 22-point program. Seniors at the University
who were baptized here three years ago with a generous
sprinkling of more-points-than-you-had point programs
may be excused from a bit of conjecture concerning the
possibilities for the success of this program in the light
of ra.th,er,dismal failures which accompanied
decessors. . ~

How_SFA will receive the proposals of the committee
cannot even be guessed at, but it does seem that among
those,22 points are quite a few worthwhile ideas. The
committee has evidently done some serious thinking and
put some earnest effort into preparing the program, and
it may be that SFA will do well to recognize the value
of several of the proposals. —

Such statements do not come at all in the editor-looks

more activity than it has. It may at the same time well
ignore facetious remarks of the few who intimate “It’s
about time for the trolley fare question to come up.”

Beyond Wildest Dreams

UST"ABOUT 130 years ago a couple of fellows named
Lewis and Clark were beating their way across the
Missouri River and plunging on to the Paciﬁc coast.
From all records Mr. Lewis and Mr. Clark didn't travel
very fast, and the trials and diﬁiculties in their attempt
to be the first of--the pioneers to reach that western sea
make rather good reading for anyone.

It is unbelievable to suppose that either of these
weary trail-blazers, when he lay down to sleep on a
bitter cold ‘night, had any dreams that little more than a
century later a“ train load of eastern folks would be rush-
ing at a mile-a-minute rate in the same direction. And
if either of them went so far as to dream that this out-
::ﬁt was mainly composed of boys going all that distance
.‘».to play. a football -game, he certainly would have called
‘it a bad nightmare and laid off eating sourdough before
:going to bed.

Those 130 years have passed, however, and the Pan-
ther football. team is on its way again to the Paciﬁc
'coast for another football battle. The worth of intercol-
legiate athletics gets a remarkable boost in any argu-
ment when one considers the opportunity which they
give for ambitious young athletes to see so much of the
country.

It’s a fine thing that the Pitt football team has such an
opportunity this year. And if it’s all right with the peo-
ple out there on the coast, we-’d appreciate a little bit
more hospitality than our teams have been receiving
in the past.

The Pitt News

0. K., Duquesne

HE UNIVERSITY’s athletic oﬂicials ought to come in
for another pat on the back for their stand on the
city football title question. Without much reason, the
question appeared for a while to lead in the direction of
a general mess. One suggestion called upon the city
fathers to thresh the thing out in council chambers.
‘Even the least wary sports writers were handling the
situation with the greatest of delicacy. It is certain that

. none of them came to the point of suggesting the gesture

which W. Don Harrison, director of University athletics,
was to make at the Curbstone Coaches’ meeting Friday
night.

Mr. Harrison cameright out in congratulating the Du-
quesne team upon its winning the city trophy by virtue
of its victory over Carnegie Tech and the latter’s score-
less tie with Pitt. The University could have just as
easily let the thing ride, and allowed the problem to con-
tinue bothering anyonewho cared to bebothered by it.
Surrendering the cup was a proper gesture; the Univer-
sity’s willingness to take the initiative. in clearing up‘
the matter was admirable. ’

After all, there’ll be a lot more ﬂavor to that Pitt-
Duquesne game next fall when it brings with it a chance
for Pittto knock off the city champions;

Letter To The Editor

Editor, The Pitt News:
This letter is being written in de-
fense of American participation in

the Olympic Games. In a measure,
it is a direct answer to a previous let-
ter appearing in the November 25 is-
sue of.The Pitt News, and, more im-
portant, it is an expression of the at-
titude of several Pitt students who
believe they are ‘justified in'taking a
defensive stand for the Olympic
Games in Berlin. Several of the stu-
dents were in Germany last summer
and feel that they to some extent are
more qualiﬁed to express their opin-
ions than they otherwise would have
been.

In the ﬁrst place, objectivity in con-
sidering a matter of this nature is of
primary importance. While we do
not consider ourselves fully equipped
to do purely scientiﬁc thinking, we do
feel that we have made a deﬁnite at-
tempt to see this thing clearly. \

Let us start with the most frequent
-argument: That politics and sports
should not be mixed. If we accept
the deﬁnition for politics as “nolitical
opinions” (Webster)
observation is that sports and politics
have been mixed. It is said that Ger-
many by its political opinions has dis-
criminated amongfits athletes. There-
fore, those favoring the United States’
withdrawal state as their
that sports and politics should not be
mixed. But since politics is political
opinions, then the very group that
presents this argument for supporting
withdrawal. defeats its nrgurm.nt bv
mixing politics and sports. The sci-
entiﬁc observation, then, is that pol-
itics and sports are inter-mingling.
The same argument is presented by

the objective :

argument =

both ‘ sides. Its ridiculousness be-
comes apparent. But our opponents
might argue that we have made the’
argument ridiculous by too narrowly
conﬁning our deﬁnition of politics.
Suppose we do broaden it to “the art
of government” (Vi/'ebster). Now our
opponents might believe that our ar-
gument is lost, because the American
“art of government” is not mixing
with the Olympics. We admit that, to
a certain extent. I

But let us consider the Negro in the
South. How has Mr. Tumpson arrived
at the conclusion that the Negro prob-
lem in our country “is inﬁnitesimal
as compared with the religion prob-
lems of Germany?” None of us stu-
dents who visited Germany last sum-
mer (and none were on special tours)
saw any acts against the Jews so con-
temptuously impertinent as acts that
can be observed daily in our Southern
States. The German could scarcely.
believe that the Negroes must ride in}
separate street cars! That the Negro!
in the South has no franchise is a well
known fact. That this problem “is
constantly being reduced in propor-
tion,” we are not at all sure. And if
it is, the reduction is so minute or the
Droblem so huge that little of signi-
ﬁcance is being accomplished.

The resolution of the Intercollegiate
Newspaper Association quoted in part
in Mr. Tumpson’s letter resolves “to
remove the games from Nazi Germany
to another land more worthy of the
honor.” Now, we ask, who is to be
The Judge of Nations? Or perhaps
the “worthy” nation will be picked by
chance, by drawing lots! Who is to
select nations “worthy” enough to sub-
mit their lots? Surely the United

States is not a “worthy” nation ac-

cording to our opponents’ logic. We
have race discrimination.

Those who favor our withdrawal
from the Olympics do so because they
believe there is a group of people be-
ing discriminated against, being perse-
cuted. The removal of the Olympics
to another country would, of course,
he a blow to Germ jny. Economically
it would affect a large number of Ger-
mans. In view of stirring up national
hatreds, it would affect a whole na-
tion or sever_al nations. That such
things are undesirable no one can
deny. That such action would be non-
beneﬁcial to a vast number of people
is beyond doubt. Shall we persecute
because there are persecuted?

This letter is not a defense of the
German Government nor its form of
government. In fact, we believe it is
a mistake to confuse a folk with a
government. That the German Gov-
ernment has a right to cry “lie-propa-
ganda” in respect to the foreign press,
some of us students proved deﬁnitely
this summer. On the other ha.nd, the
German Press is not beyond criticism.
either. Undoubtedly one of the most
vicious forms of press progaganda
both outside of Germany and within
Germany is the selection of news ar-
ticles that shall be printed and played
up. Such types can not be labeled
“lie-propaganda.” They are merely
truths whose importance is highly ex-
aggerated. It is this t.VDe of thing.
we believe. has stirred up unduly this
whole problem,

5,000 People Treated Each Month

At Elaborately Equipped Falk Clinic

X-Ray Units Enable
Doctors «To Handle
Cancer Patients

 

Undergraduate impressions of the
Falk Clinic on Fifth Avenue‘ are
mainly centered in_ Dr. H. ,C1ifford
Carlson"s - Student {Health - .Se1]#vice
rooms, but the Clinic, as a whole-is
one of Pittsburghfs ﬁnest social medi-
cine clinics. _ ’

Over 5,000 persons a month are
treated‘ here during. the busy seasons
when the "clinic isoperated three to
f ur days a week. The facilities in-
clude $40,000 to $50,000 worth of
X-ray -equipment which includes one
of the two condenser X-ray units in

the ‘city. These units enable the doc-~

tors to get X-rays of the heart that
are not blurred. '

Other units "of this equipment are
a deep therapy unit for treatment of
cancer; a‘ stereo plate X-r y which
enables doctors to get a depth picture
X-ray, enabling them to place exactly
the relative position of an object-in
the‘ body and special machines for
X-raying the body in various posi-
tions, ‘ _ T " ‘7‘ _

A completelyequipped dental clinic‘,
laboratories, general clinics, a special
dark room for X-ray developing, an
eye clinic,‘ special rooms for genito-
urinary patients, and allergy clinics

are other features of this modern
clinic.
The building is equippedlto take
care of 700 patients a day but present
ﬁnancial conditions permit a peak
load of only four or ﬁve hundred.
The School of Medicine of the Uni-
-versity in its Clinic work has devel-
oped an effective method for tracing
the causes of the various types of
skin sensitivity and, a deﬁnite proce-
dure for relieving this condition. Al-
lergy is the common name for most
skin irritations caused by sensitivity
to woolens, hay seed, chicken feath-
ers and other substances. Asthma is
the most common form of allergy.
Previous to University work in this
ﬁeld, "sufferers from this ailment could
get little relief. 7
Perhaps the most vital contribution
to the social _we1fare.of the city by
the Falk Clinic is the work done in
the “clinics —whe-re venereal diseases
are treated. Here twice a week,'once
for~men and once -for women, those
so afflicted and who cannot afford to
be treated by a private physician
come. This is one of the most diffi-
cult groups the Clinic has to handle.
Ingratitude for the workbeing done,
lack of reasonable co-operation, and
the peristent idea that treatment and
drugs should be freeare marked char-
acteristics of this group. The actual
treatment of these" patients is rela-
tively simple ‘The number of pa-
tients average 600 a month or more.
Aside from its great value to the
community, the Clinic affords medical

students of the University the oppor-
tunity to learn their profession from
actual practice and observation. All
clinics are used as class rooms. The
nose and throat clinic arrangement
is typical. There are 16 booths ar-

 

ranged so that an instructor sup3r- _

vises the workof four students hi
one group, . They examine the pa-
tients and make diagnoses while the
instructor criticises, and aids them. ,
‘When the Clinic was established
there were many" doctors in the city
who opposed. it on the grounds "git

would endanger private practice‘ by"

taking away patients. To guard
against these accusations one of, the
most rigidly enforced regulations of
the Clinic is that every patient must
have a written recommendation from
his doctor before he will be accepted.
To further guard against irritation of
private practitioners, all doctors work-
ing in the Clinic give their services
free. All Clinic doctors are members
of the University. faculty. ’ '
The prescription service forithe
patients is operated by the'School of
Pharmacy. Here under the guidance
of experienced men, students in the
school get practical experience and a.
clearer insight into the hospitals and
doctors viewpoint of pharmacy.

‘Carlson Theory’
Emerges Despite

Seminar Smoke

“The Carlson Theory” made its ap-
pearance Thursday at the AE-ME
seminar. This theory was advanced
by Dr. H. C. Carlson, director of the
student health service, during an in-
formal talk to the group. When the sub-
ject of smoking made itself obvious be-
cause of the thick blanket of smoke
covering Room 817, Cathedral, the
site of the seminar, Carlson told of
effect the habit has on the nasal cav-
ity.

As warm air rises, he deduced that
a portion of the. smoke inhaled would
lodge in the cavity at the top of the
month. At this place, the carbon
monoxide and other constituents of
the smoke remain_here to cause
harm. One of the greatest evils, he
said, was the presence of nasal oils
in this region to combat the ill effects
of the smoke. These oils will some-
times effect the voice.

State Medical Service
To Be Debate Subject

The \Vomen’s Debating Association
will present its second extension de-

_ bate of the semester tomorrow after-

noon at 2:30 o’clock before the Belle-
vue Round Table Club at the VVo-
men’s Exchange.

Marcella Leyton, C37, and Jean-
nette Schwartz, ‘C38, will uphold the
affirinative side of the question: “Re-
solved, that the several states should
enact legislation providing for a com-
plete system of medical service at
public expense.” On the negative side
will be Ruth Friedberg. Ed36, and An-
nabelle Bottlander, C38.

The Association is continuing work
on the intercollegiate question of the
year: “Resolved, that Congress
should have the power by a two-thirds
majority vote to overrule decisions of
the Supreme Court making legisla-
tion of Congress unconstitutional.

‘ ‘Engineers Need Culture’ ’

“Because you're engineers,” point-
ed out N. Robert Seidle, assistant to
the dean of men, “many of you think
you needn’t bother with culture. But
you're wrong, for culture plays an
important role; in business contacts.”

This was the point stressed by Mr.
Seiclle in his lecture on College Orien-
tation in the Freshman Chem Engi-
neering Seminar yesterday.

Pitt-In-China May Be Traced
Through Varied Leaclership

 

With the closing of the Campus
Chest Drive for this year. one of the
most frequent questions asked is
“VVhat is Pitt-In-China ?”

Many years ago, somebody decided
to raise money to establish a fellow-
ship for a University graduate at
Lingnan University, outside Canton.
China. At that time, the fund was
raised and administered by an inde-
pendent committee.

Later, when it was decided to com-
bine all ageucies of the Community
Fund, Pitt-In-China came to be ad-
ministered by the old Student Council.
When this body was dissolved, and
the present Student-Faculty Associa-
tion was created. this charitable prol-
ect fell under their jurisdiction.

In the meantime. Lingnan University
returned the compliment by setting up
an exchange scholarship to the Uni-

I versity. The latest alumnus to return
is Charles Seidle. brother of Robert
Seidle, "assistant to the dean of men,
who returned last year after a three-
year stay at Canton.

This year, SFA decided that since. it
is voluntary on their part to sponsor
this institution. they would rather es-
tablish a men's student loan fund.
The loan fund is to be administered
separately from the women’s fund,
which is handled bv the VVomen’s Self
Government ‘ 'Association;“'

Rather than give up such a project,
the executive committee of this year's
drive decided to return Pitt-In—(‘hina
to an independent, and to draw funds
for it from the Campus Chest Drive.

At the present time. no conmiitteo
has been set up. but will probably in-
clude both faculty and student mem-
,bers. and will have the duty of choos-
[ing the alumnus to be sent to China.

Host To Boxers

Sc_hricker,. Five Mittinen Invited
To Aid “Sports Day” Program 1

 

 

Avalon High School will play host
to Coach Jack Schricker and a few
members of his boxing team this
week. Among the men making the
trip are John Stronko, Al Ptaslowski,
Abe Konick, Ralph Caruso, and Hen-
ry' Kaufmann. '

The program is planned as a Sports
Day Assembly. Schrickerwill give an
address on the ups and downs of box-
ing,’while the boxers will act as the

. 1:-rincipals in a series of demonstra-

tions concerning the science of self-
defense. ‘ "
,P_racti_ce sessions have become more
intensive in the past week. The can-
didates _are coming along in fine‘ shape
but lack experience for the most part.
A few of the men who are showing
improvement in practice. are Al Pas-
lowski, 129pounds; Russell Vogel, 149
pounds; John Str_onko, 145 pounds;
George Dines, 155. pounds; and Abe
Konick, a 139-pounder.

Subsequent practices will ﬁnd the
squad enlarged by the addition of four
football men who have signiﬁed their
intentions of trying out for the box-
ing team. Frank Patrick, Ted
Schmidt, George Musulin, and Tony
Matisi will‘ ﬁll out the heavyweight
ranks «when they report after the
Christmas recess.

The 165-pounders are all freshmen,
so Coach Schricker would welcome
any upperclassmen of that weight who
desire to comeout for boxing. The
training sessions will continue to be
held throughout.“t‘lie "Christmas" vaca-
tion with about nine days of the re-
cess occupied by practices.

This will be‘ the last, year for Gene
Stougliton, a 175-pound boxer, who is
the. only senior on the squad. Gene,
who has had indifferent success in

his class during the past two years, .

is expected to go places this year.
Last year Stoughton wontwo out of
seven bouts, one in the VVisconsin
matchand the other in his Navy
ﬁght »

If the members of the boxing team
still want a banquet, they are request-
ed to give their money to Coach
Schricker. The price of the affair
has been set at 65 cents.

Among the other prospective can-
didates expected to report is Mike
Sivak, one of the outstanding mem-
bers of last year's freshman team.
He is only a sophomore, and with
three years of varsity competition
ahead of him should develop into an
excellent ﬁghter.

 

Call For Boxing Entries

 

“There’s still time to get those en-
tries in for the fourth annual Intra-
mural Boxing tourney” promises .Mar-
tin J. _Feely, director. .

Fraternities are especially urged to
organize teams for the competition,
for if six or more fraternities ﬁle
entries, a cup will be awarded.

Real Kick For Panther Harriers Did Not

Come Until ‘The  Very End pf Past Season

Stopping Navy Aggregation
, Gave Olsonmen High
Note For Finish

By Edwin H. Beachler

' Schenley Park’s hills and a scrappy
band ofvsophomores and juniors under;
the baton of Coach Carl Olson, in his‘
fourth year at" the controls, ﬁnished
fast to sink a staggering Gob squad
from Annapolis and hang up a real
“surprise” record for the 1935 season.
. Harold Test and Sam Musico were
the only members of last year’s_ Na-'
tional Junior champions reporting for
action in early September. Stricken

_with appendicitis," Sam, holder of the

four-mile Navy record, was taken to
the hospital for an operation‘ that put

‘him out of competition for the ‘season.

The remarkable factor in the cur-

these six candidates came-through for
Olson, and in- a style even surprising
to the hard-driving instructor. .

WSGA Committee
Suggests Change
In Constitution

Curriculum Group May Suggest
Addition Of Art, Music
Criticism Course

Would you like to take a course in
Art and Music appreciation? The
curriculum committee of WSGA is
making a survey of schools offering
such a course and the method in
which it is presented, with the object
of having such a course offered here.
Thus reported Blanche Shore, Ed36,
chairman of the committee at the
commission meeting last Thursday.

If enough students are in favor of
such a. course, the idea will be pre-
sented by the committee to the admin-
istration authorities.

A project for the entertainment of
women students from Johnstown Cen-
ter at the Interclass Sing on Decem-
ber 13 was explained at the meeting.

Fernande Mercier, Ed36, spoke con-
cerning the newly organized women’s
orchestra, and invited all women on
campus who play instruments to join
the groups, which is under the direc-
tion of Lee Lockhart, director of mu-
sic.

A lengthy discussion resulted from
t.he introduction of. several proposed
amendments to the WSGA constitu-
tion. Dorothy Dresser, Ed37, chair-
man of the constitution committee,
presented the plan whereby the in-
cumbent Senior Court would, at the
time of the selection of the next year's
court, also name the officers of the
succeeding group. The amendment
was rejected.

Another amendment concerned a
change‘ in Article IV, Section 2. The
present constitution states that the
executive committee should include a
representative from each of the four
In practice, how-
ever, the freshman class is not includ-
ed, so the change excluding them was
suggested. This amendment was
passed and will be presented at the
next meeting of the entire WSGA.

Approximately 60 committee mem-
bers of WSGA attended the dinner
meeting.

Lithuanian Roo

m Receives

Peasant Art Contributions

By Muriel White

Dr. J. Baltrusaitis, Pittsburgh physi-
cian, has. just returned from a four
months’ trip to Lithuania where she
met and conferred with the designer
of the Lithuanian Room in the Cathe-
dral, Mr. Gudiatis, regarding the dec-
oration of the room.

' Dr. ‘Baltrusaitis stated that the’
Lithuanian Room in the Cathedral has
been an inspiration to the people of
that country. Up until 1918, Lithu-
ania was under the subjection of other
nations and was not able to develop
an art of its own. Since that time the
peasant motif has been used in Lith-
uanianart and will beiused ingthe de-
signing of the room in the Cathedral.‘

Among the gifts which Dr. Bal-
trusaitis brought back with her for
the room is a hand—carved spinner.

The spinner represents the native
peasant woman and her antiquated

type of spinning. The national cos-
tume of Lithuania adorns the spinner
who is seated on a hope chest de-
signed with black and red tulips.
Over the peasant woman’s head is
draped a white mantel called a
nuometa which denotes womanhood
in Lithuania.

versity by the Grazina Drangija Club
of Lithuania. This club is made up
of prominent women of that country,
including the wife of the president.
and the prime minister.

"Two colorful aprons given by the
past president of Lithuania, Dr.
Grinius, were among the presents.
which Dr. Baltrusaitis brought with
her. The spinning, dyeing and weav-
ing of these aprons was done by
peasant women.

Michalina Glemzalte, author of text-
books on art for Lithuanian schools,
sent a belt that was worn by the vil-
lage matchmaker to decorate a wall!
of a room.
