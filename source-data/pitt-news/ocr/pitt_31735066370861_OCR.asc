Pitt creates center
to study chronic pain

By Susan Washbum
The Pitt News '

The University of Pittsburgh an-
nounced the establishment of the
$500,000 Center for Pain Evaluation
and Treatment on Monday. The new
center will aid the victims and research
the causes of chronic pain.

Dennis Turk, Ph.D., will serve as
the director of the center, and Charles
Boucek, M.D., has been appointed as
the medical director. The center has
been established in coordination with
both Eye and Bar and Presbyterian-
University Hospitals. -

Dr. Thomas Detre, senior vice presi-
dent of Health Sciences at Pitt, said the
center will “include an active research
component and will serve the com-
munity for providing education pro-
grams.” . ~

According to Detre, the research
component and education programs
make CPET unique to the tri-state area.

Chronic pain -— the most common
forms being back pain, headaches and
arthritis"-— strikes‘ more than 75 million

Analyst predicts

Americans. CPET will seek to
eliminate both" the physical sensation
and psychological factors involved in
pain, usingprocedures such as physical
therapy, occupational therapy, biofeed-
back, stress management and voca-
tional and family counseling.

The patient’s physical condition, age
and life circumstances determine the
specific nature of the treatment. Once
doctors designate a treatment plan, pa-

tients are serviced by either Eye and ‘

Ear Hospital, if they are outpatients,
or Presbyterian-University Hospital, if
they require close medical supervision.
In all treatments at CPET, patient
motivation, responsibility and family
involvement will -be emphasized.
CPET has also received the support
of the American Chronic Pain Associa-
tion; The association “congratulates
the University of Pittsburgh for ad-
dressing this public health problem,”

’ said Penny Co'wan, executive director

of the association. “Health care pro-
fessionals in Pittsburgh — through
them, their patients —— will be. :fit from

the presence of this. center in. Pitts- _ .

U.S. Foreign Policy
stimulates terrorism

By Jack Burkman
The Pitt News

Dr. Sharough Akhavi, a professor of
political science at the University of
South Carolina, criticized the Reagan
‘administration’s Middle East policies
Monday evening at the Colloquim on
Security at Pitt. He also offered some
advice as to how the United States
might better deal with terrorism.

“If American Mideastern policy
continues in the same trek, we will see
increasing incidents of terrorism,”

Akhavi stated in an exclusive interview _

with The Pitt News. I

Akhavi, an expert on the political and
sociological systems, in the Middle
East, identified Reagan’s two primary
faux pas: condoning the 1982 Israeli in-
vasion of Lebanon and ordering the
battleship New Jersey to shell Shiite
positions on the Lebanese coast. The
result of these actions, Akhavi said,
was that “the U.S. military un-
necessarily engaged itself in a civil war
and took sides - we supported the
government of Lebanon.” From this
time on, Akhavi pointed out, “ter-
rorism against the United States in the
Mideast greatly intensiﬁed. ”

Akhavi also rebuked the president’s
refusal to deal with the Palestinian
Liberation Organization unless the
PLO would recognize the sovereign
state of Israel. He implied that the
Reagan administration is needlessly im-
peding negotiations with a stipulation
for the Israelis, who “will never
recognize the PLO, anyway.”

Akhavi, however, offered advice as
well as criticism. He said he feels the
United States should be aware of the

-magnitude and complexity of the situa-
tion. “There are a variety of Islamic

sects and an even greater variety of ‘
Islarmc reactions to Western presence, ..

in the Middle.East..”. '_ - .. .

\
~.. ...:i~

“It is high time to take
risks for peace in the Mid-
dle East.

—— Dr. Sharough Akhavi

~ Enhancing the complexity of the pro-
blem, Akhavi said, is the fact that much
of the conﬂict in the Middle East is self-
perpetuating, that is,. it would exist with
or without Western inﬂuence in the
region. He added that much of the ter-
rorism as well has’ little to do with
Reagan policies. Akhavi said Reagan
should be wary of intervening in deep-
rooted religious wars. '

Furthermore, Akhavi urged
American leaders to explore diplomatic
and not military channels in combating
terrorism. “‘No matter how reprehen-
sive an action may seem, we shouldn’t
follow it up  with force,” he said.
“Ultimately, this will downgrade our
values in both our eyes and in the eyes
of the world.”

Akhavi also urged the Reagan ad-
ministration to work toward
establishing Palestinian hegemony in
this much-disputed territory, which is
currently occup_ied by the Israelis.
Akhavi said he feels that terrorism
might be reduced by giving the Pales-
tinians total or at least partial control
of the West Bank. He suggested that
financial pressure might be brought
upon Israel by the U.S. government in
order to achieve this end.

“It is,’_’ Akhavi concluded, “high
time to take risks for peace in" the Mid-
dle. Eastg.’-3'. A. A_..   ~

VisitingSoViets seek cultural relations

By Joe Krzywiecki
Staff Writer -

“The United States and‘ the Soviet
Union must overcome their fears and
misconceptions of each other,’-’ said

' Malakhat Shakhabova, one of three
Soviet women who spoke at" a panel
discussion Monday at the William Pitt
Union.

Shakhabova went on to say, “We are
interested in your culture and your
language. We have to bring our

‘children up so they canhave a real
understanding of each other.”

One of the misconceptions, said
Yekaterina Orlova, editor of a Soviet
magazine, is that the Soviet Union
trains-its children for war. “There is
no education about war in our schools.
We are women, not military
specialists,” stated Orlova. The Soviet
Union, Orlova said, agreed years ago
not to be the ﬁrst to start a nuclear war.

The local Peace Links organization
sponsored the visit in hopes that a face-
to-face meeting between Soviet and
American women would bring about
increased knowledge of the differences
and similarities in the lifestyles of both
countries,

 I; Margarita Zib0I0Va. an.-¢iCQ11‘I2f.IV1igS_.13g_ay;,g;\ll§e4;only:.see:.th

. _. vi) I213!-af~7.;;‘ ‘

V researcher in the Soviet Union,

said,“Our kindergartens have an inter-
national class where the children learn
about different parts of the world. One
thing they learn is that both countries
[the United States and the USSR] have
so much in common with the other.
Both are large and each has many na-
tionalities; ’ ’ '

Noting that the Soviet Union is a
symbol of fear for many Americans,
Ziborova said that the fear is caused by
ignorance and lack of knowledge.
“The last thing we want is war. We
know first hand what the horror of war
really is. We lost millions of people on
our own soil and fought off an invading
army. That is something that the United
States never had to do.”

Orlova agreed with Ziborova, say-

, ing that some American students do not

know that the United States and the
Soviet Union fought together in World
War II.

Carol Brown, one of three American
women who sat on a panel with the
Soviet women, said, “We can only
build trust with knowledge. ,We must

increase the teaching of foreign-

languages in our schools. The mass

media is our greatest teaching tool to- . '

through TV and the newspaper, and 11.0‘?

by meeting its people.” '.

Joan Webster, another panelist,

agreed. -Most Americans never go to

other countries to see the myriads of

different cultures and ideas. She stated —

that ‘ ‘Itseems this country [the United
States], has a problem respecting other
people in different countries. We have
to learn to respecthow otliergpeople
wish to conduct their lives. Webster,
a pediatrician, stated that she plans to
go to New Guinea with her husband to
teach cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

‘ “Most people ask me, Why am I go-

ing? I want to experience another
culture, like these Soviet women are
doing today.” . .

The Peace Links. gathering was

picketed brieﬂy by a small group of
protesters who claimed that the three
So/viet women were members of the
Soviet KGB. Mary Delaney, one of the
protesters, said she was displeased that
so-called average Soviet citizens were
represented. She claimed that the
average Soviet citizens are “slaves-”
who are unable to have a say in their
own government. She also claimed that

' the three Soviet women wereiwell-paid,
while most Soviet citizens stand in line.

Weinberger: new Soviet missile “unquestionable violation”

WASHINGTON — In a prepared
speech for the Ethics and Policy
Center,‘ Defense Secretary Caspar
Weinberger said that the Soviet Union

has deployed a new inter-continental --

ballistic missile that he calls “an ex-
tremely versatile weapon.”
Weinberger also said the new SS-25
missile represents “an unquestionable
violation” of the unratified SALT H
weapons treaty. The Strategic Arms
Limitation Treaty II was signed by the
superpowers, but it was never ratified
by the US Senate. The Pentagon has
charged that the pact allows develop-
ment of one missile, and it says
Moscow has built two new ones.
Moscow, meanwhile, is denying that
it is developing a ‘ ‘Star Wars’ ’ system
of its own. Still, ofﬁcials at a Kremlin

' news conference warned that the
- United States will not “get a monopo-

ly” on weapons in space if it presses

. forward with President Reagan’s

Strategic Defense Initiative.

“Sun City” song
blasts apartheid

I

South Africa — The anti-apartheid
song “Sun City,” written by “Little
Steven” Van Zandt, will be the focus

of a reception planned at the United

  How to get your notes in order.  

.1

Nations Oct.30.

The song is a scathing indictment of
South Africa’s system of racial separa-
tion and of the US policy toward that
system. »

The real Sun City is a resort in one
of the so-called black “homelands”
created by the South African
government.

The song features an impresive
lineup. Nearly 50 top performers in
rock, jazz, soul and rap music have lent
their talents to the piece, including Lou
Reed, Jackson Browne, Ringo Starr
and Bruce Springsteen.

All royalties from “Sun City” and
the album that goes with it will go to
the Africa fund to help South African
exiles and political prisoners. It also
will be spent to educate people against
apartheid. — ’

Because the target is a political
system and not the famine that inspired
“We Are the World,” “Sun City” is
angry and pointed music. The lyrics in-
clude, “We’re stabbing our brothers
and sisters in the back,” and “This
quiet diplomacy ain’t nothing but a
joke.”

Although it’s inevitable that the big
charity recordings like “We Are the
World” will taper ‘off in frequency,
Steven says he thinks musicians will

keep making message songs. He says
music people are ﬁnding a voice that
“they’ve always had but didn’t know
they had  and they want to use it.”

Meanwhile, one of Africa’s elder
statesman, President Kenneth Kaunda

[of Zambia, today accused South

Africa’s white-rriinority government of
becoming “more cruel” in the face of
mounting pressure to end apartheid. In
a speech to the UN General Assembly,
Kaunda accused Pretoria’s leadership
of "arrogance.” He called on South
Africa to lift a four-month-old state of
emergency, to legalize black political
parties and to free jailed African Na-
tional Congress leader Nelson
Mandela.

Philadelphia
news strike ends

PHILADELPHIA — The city’s
46-day newspaper strike ended yester-
day as striking employees returned to
their jobs at the Philadelphia Inquirer
and Daily News. , ‘ ' _

Publisher Philadelphia Newspapers,
Inc. says the two papers will be back
on the streets today.

, All nine striking unions have ratiﬁed

a contract with the two newspapers that
provides for a wage and benefits
package of $150 a week by the end of
a four-year pact.

The Teamsters Union, which last
week dashed hopes of a settlement

when it rejected the contract by a -

12-vote margin, today voted to accept
the contract. The teamsters’ vote was
248-132.

The Newspaper Guide, representing
reporters, photographers and some
business workers, voted shortly after
the teamsters in a 606-130 ballot in
favor of the contract.

Strike continues
at Chrysler plant . -

DETROIT — Non-stop bargaining
lasting 27 hours has produced some
progress in talks between Chrysler and
its 70,000 striking United Auto
Workers. UAW president Owen
Bieber says the unioii will stay at the
Detroit bargaining table as long as pro-

gress is possible. Officials say several

major items remain unresolved,
holding up a tentative agreement to end

_the walkout, now in its seventh day, ,

that has already cost Chrysler an
estimated_$60 million.

Residents protest
hazardous waste sites

HARRISBURG — A throng of
Lawrence County residents showed up
at the state capital today to seek legisla-
tion limiting the siting of hazardous
waste treatment and disposal facilities.

Solidtek Systems, Inc. wants to build
such a facility in North Beaver and
Mahoning Townships in Lawrence
County.

Yesterday’s protest in Harrisburg
was organized by Citizens Against
Toxic Sites, and a few hundred people
took part. Group members say the
Solidtek facility would be too close to
public buildings and homes.

Two bills before the legislature
would place tougher restrictions on
where toxic sites could be located.

Solidtek says it plans to use a treat-
ment system for toxic wastes that

would virtually assure no contamina- -

tion of land and water.
The company says the plant is need-
ed because there is only one other

» similar waste facility in the state, and

that is expected to close soon._
"Solidtek says it will submit an ap-
plicationto the Environmental Depart-
ment in "December for the plant. It ex-
pects the $50 million facility to be
operational by Spring 1987. . M

Multi—organ transplants endorsed
by Children’s Hospital committee

By Susan Washburn
The Pitt News

The Human Rights Committee of
Children’s Hospital has unanimously
endorsed a proposal which would allow
doctors to perform multi-organ
transplants involving the liver, in-
testines, pancreas, spleen and parts of
the stomach.

Presbyterian-University Hospital,
however, is delaying a decision on a
similar procedure until doctors provide
more information for a review
committee.

The procedure will be performed on
individuals who have lost major por-
tions of their intestines. Shortened in-
testines do not allow the body to ab-
sorb necessary levels of nutrition, and
the patients must be fed intravenously
to survive. For reasons not yet
understood by the medical communi-
ty, the liver ceases to function after
years of intravenous feeding.

Rather than simply replacing" the
liver and returning the patient to in-
travenous feeding, Dr. Thomas Starzl,
creator of the process, proposes doing
the multi-organ transplant.

Although no recipient is awaiting the
procedure at Children’s, doctors are

authorized to perform the surgery if the_
patient would not beneﬁt from any
other type of treatment.

If Presbyterian-University Hospital
decides to authorize the transplant pro-
cedure, Herbert Seal of Pekin, Ind.,
will be the first patient at Presbyterian
to undergo abdominal transplant
surgery. Sea] has lost much of his in-
testine to ulcerative colitis and has been
fed intravenously since 1980.

Starzl developed the procedure us-
ing animals, and Carlos Esquivel,

assistant professor of surgery at Pitt, V

implemented the procedure using ap-
proximately a dozen pigs this pa
years. _' .

Tomorrow, faculty members from the College of Arts
and Sciences will vote on a proposal to eliminate the
“no-entry” part of the credit/no-entry grade option.

If the proposal is accepted, student’s only alternatives
to a letter grade will be H/S/U (honors/satisfactory/un-
satisfactory) and P/ X (passed/ not graded).

‘Although technically the X grade does not stand for
failure, anyone looking at a student’s transcript is go-
ing to wonder why the student did not receive a grade.

The anonymity offered to students by the no—entry op-
tion and the security of being able to fail a course that
they would normally not take will no longer exist if the
proposal is accepted Thursday.

The change in the current grade—option system is be-
ing proposed by Deans Baranger and Schulman because
of a conversion to a computerized student information
system. The credit/no entry system would cost additional
money because of the cost of removing a course from
a student’s transcript.

Eliminating the no—entry option and replacing it with
an X or U grade completely defeats the purpose of a
no-grade system.

We feel giving students the opportunity to take classes
that might pose an unreasonable risk to their Q.P.A.
under a no-risk no—entry system is worth the extra in-
vestment by the university.

Complications

While I do not support apartheid in
any form, I would like to pose several
relevant questions to those so
vehemently against it.

First, are either of your parents or
any of your relatives employed by com-
panies that do business with South
Africa? If so, would you ask them to
quit their jobs in protest?

Second, if I were to offer you one
(or more) Krugerrands, would you
refuse them on the premise of being
anti-apartheid?

Finally (and most relevant), if uni-
versity divestiture meant increased tui-
tion costs, would you still be so will-
ing to support disinvestment? R

Clearly, this brings the issue to a per-
sonal level, and the answers are not so
cut-and-dry. Perhaps those among us
who fall into one or more of the above
categories should either re-examine
their values or soften their criticism.

Call for Justice

As a Christian, I always believed
God created this world for all beings
to live in, to exercise our brains, liber-
ty, and freedom (within limits) for the
betterment of mankind. However, man
with his selﬁsh traits, created class '-
not the one you and I attend lectures
in but one that divides people not
based on merit but on the color of their
skin, a philosophy which holds one
race superior and another inferior.

America, the so-called “Godfather
of Democracy,” capitalized on this rule
for centuries to root the Indians out of
this country and forcibly bring the
African here to cultivate the ﬁelds and
develop the land. For a price, the
African was shot and killed on the field
like wild game. If he survived, he was
confined to the ghetto and restricted
from eating in certain restaurants and
made to believe he was inferior.

Today, we hear about the Soviet
Union restricting and jailing their peo-
ple based on disagreements in
ideology. America finds this so
disgusting that they go out of their way
“in the name of liberty” to help gain
the freedom of these Russians and to
possibly give them a new and better
chance at life. How wonderful!

The irony of this gesture is that the
very same people turn around and drink
coffee at the same table with the op-
pressive regime of South Africa while
discussing the prices of chromium and
Krugerrand gold coins.

Letters to the Editor

My question is: “What gives one
country the right to torture its people
and another not to?” Day in and day
out, men are killed, tortured and
jailed without trial in South Africa.
Women and children alike are shot on
the streets of Soweto. The place is
worse than the “killing fields” of Cam-
bodia, yet America cannot do anything
to stop this fascist regime of Pretoria.

Does this government have the right
to kill its citizens discriminatorily
because it is non-communist? At most,
the Reds jail their citizens, not murder
them. I have been there.'The kind of
treatment meted out to black South
Africans can be equated to none but
that meted out to the Africans in 19th-
century America.

I am neither racist nor anti-American
(call me a commie if you will — better
red than dead). I am only concerned
with what is happening to my people
of South Africa and what role America
is playing as a leader of democracy.
The Statue of Liberty would weep and
shed tears if she were aware of what’s
going on in South Africa.

The late Haile Selaisse once said,
‘ ‘Until that day the ignoble and unhap-
py regime that holds our brothers in

Angola, South Africa, in a subhuman.

bondage has been toppled and utterly

destroyed, there will be war.” There ‘-

is a fascist regime, a late 20th-century
Hitler in South Africa. Some day,
America will be digging Botha’s grave
somewhere in the Andes to satisfy the
blacks and the world at large that this
Nazi disciple is truly dead. But until
that day when preachers of apartheid
and segregation, like Jerry Falwell,
become just another page in history,
there will always be war!

X-Grade

The Student Government Board
would like to bring to your attention a
proposal before the Faculty of Arts and
Sciences that could have some effect
on your academic career. This proposal
outlines a uniform university-wide
grading system to reduce the costs and
facilitate the conversion of the student
information system to the proposed
new-computer system. While reducing
costs is important, the potentially hartn—
ful impact of this proposal is the call
to eliminate the no entry option which
will be replaced with an X on the
transcript and will be deﬁned as “not
graded.”

After consulting with various
representatives of student organizations
and numerous other students, we have
concluded that the elimination of the no
entry option would havepa negative_ef-
feet on students. Currently, if you are

taking a class utilizing a credit/no en-
try grade option and receive a C or bet-
ter, the course would appear on your
transcript, and you would receive credit
for it. If you are not able to obtain a
C in the course, it would not appear on
your transcript at all.

The utilization of an X, with its ob-
vious negative overtone, would appear
to future employers and graduate
schools as an unsatisfactory completion
of the course. This would discourage
students from attempting to try new
areas and challenging their abilities
unless they are absolutely sure of their
success. As a multi-faceted university,
it is our obligation to provide
challenges and opportunities for our
students.

This proposal will be brought to a
vote on Oct. 24. Student Government
is asking all of you to take the time to
ask your professors to please oppose
this proposal. By taking the time to talk
to them, you will be helping to show
the faculty that the students at the
University of Pittsburgh are very in-
terested in positively inﬂuencing
academic decisions on our campus.

Student Funds Supporting Racism and Bigotry  

Recently the University of Pittsburgh
was the sight of an anti-apartheid
demonstration. Students united to pro-
test the wrongful oppression of blacks
in South Africa. It is, however, ironic
that the same organization which was
responsible for mobilizing the rally —
namely the Black Action Society —
would invite Black Muslim leader
Louis Farrakhan to lecture at the
campus.

Louis Farrakhan is infamous for his
racial slurs. He has managed to alienate
Jews, and «various other groups,
through his bigotry and intolerance of
other races. Farrakhan, who is the
leader of the Nation of Islam move-
ment, has called Judaism a “dirty
religion” and accused the United States
of conspiracy in its support of Israel.

Not long ago, Farrakhan accepted a

$5 million interest-free loan from
Muammar Qaddaﬁ, leader of Libya.
Upon receiving the loan, he remarked,
“[Qaddaﬁ] is a fellow struggler in the
course of liberation of our people.”

“America,” he continued, “you
should be ashamed of yourself, you
who are the outlaw. How can the leader
of a little country like Libya terrorize
the world?”

I’ll tell you how, Mr. Farrakhan:
with the help of the Soviet Union,
which manipulates Quaddaﬁ in its ef-
fort to destroy democracy. Yes, poor
little Quaddafi. I feel sorry for the lit-
tle fellow. How sad he must be when
one of his assassination attempts fails
or when his efforts to cause a racial war
in the United States prove unsuccessful.
He even remarked on Feb. 24, 1984,
that he would supply the arms if the

403,000 blacks in the U.S. armed
forces would revolt and fight for a
separate state.

By creating hatred among fellow
Americans, Quaddaﬁ hopes to create
political unrest and instability. In en-
dorsing Farrakhan, the Black Action
Society is supporting a man who claims
that one of the world’s most hated and
irrational men is a helpless victim, a
man who states, “Judaism is a dirty
religion; Israel is not divinely backed,
it is. an outlaw state.”

Does a double standard exist for the
BAS? It protests against the unjust doc-
trine of apartheid in South Africa, yet
it endorses a man who fervently pro-
motes bigotry and racial discrimina-
tion. Farrakhan accepts handouts from
the very people who threaten

democracy while crying out for
freedom.

The issue here is not whether Mr.
Farrakhan should be permitted to speak
here. He can, because he has the right
of free speech, even if he manipulates
that right for his own avaricious pur-
poses. The wrong is that student
monies are being used to fund this
event — this I strongly object to. I
would not endorse a man who calls
Hitler great or who refers to Judaism
as a gutter religion.

I must question the judgment of those
who have deemed that money from the
student activity fund will be used to
support this monster. If the BAS wants
to see him, then let it pay him, not those
of us who detest this sort of bigotry.
This man fosters hatred among fellow
Americans. He predicts a race war by
1986. If there is one, Mr. Farrakhan,

you will have been a leading cause.

Are we to be believe that the BAS .

only believes in justice for blacks? I

hope to see those of us who are uniﬁed .

in the ﬁght against racism and bigotry

will protest this event. Make your voice A

heard. Send letters. Remember, it’s
your money and your right. '

By the way, it's funny how a man
from the Simon Wiesenthal Center was
denied funding to speak at Pitt because
it was feared that he would donate his
money to the center (horrorsll), an
organization that does good in society
instead of promoting hatred among
human beings. The Student Govern-
ment Board claims that this would be
bending the rules. Sorry, but it is Mr,
Farrakhan who bends the rules. In fact,
he makes the Constitution bend until it
hurts all of us.

, With a new AM station extension to
be established by mid-November, a
nine-band birthday celebration in
September, and a waiting list of 200
aspiring disc jockeys, Pitt’s WPTS
(98.5 FM) isn’t doing bad for a
yearling. V
Yet the 10-watt station staffed by 70
people is still struggling to attain an
identity in Pittsburgh’s music world, an
identity somewhere between new sound
and successful sound, professionalism
and fun and the creative opportunities
allowed by a noncommercial radio sta-
tion and the bounds of an
administration-owned radio license.
‘ Prior to August, WPTS was a
student-owned, student-operated radio
station operating on Carrier Current,

 a type of cable radio transmittable on-
U ly to the Pitt dorms. In August, the

university ofﬁcially purchased the sta-

Ation’s non-proﬁt broadcast license.

Since then, the station has been try-i

"ing to ﬁnd its sound. “We are deﬁned

as the new music,” said marketing
director Bill Boring. “Before March,

.we ‘were looking more toward other

C stations for our sound. Now it’s dif-

ferent. Our music is derived from
places like the College Music Journal,
and this is a newer style of music.”

; Boring attributes the sound largely to
the station’s music director, Patty

C WPTS’ format: structured fun

Pisula.

“This music is not as popular as
Springsteen’s ‘Born in the U.S.A.’ or
as mindless as Madonna, but it has
good, widespread appeal, and it is a
unique sound,” said Pisula, who ad-
mits that the station was a little skep-
tical in March when she began her
position as music director and began
changing the station’s sound. “They
chose me for my musical experience
and tastes, and to help the station to
develop an identity away from com-
mercial stations.”

Pisula believes that the fresh sound
of WPTS reﬂects a change in the at-
titudes of the college youth of the
1980s. “These youths are different,
more socially and politically conscious,
more attuned to emotion and more
analytical,” said Pisula. “I can tell by
the music they are requesting  the
Smiths, U2, Style Council, groups that
make more of an emotional and social
plea.”

The music evaluation standards that
are used by WPTS, according to
Pisula, are also different from those of
commercial stations. “Commercial sta-
tions judge their songs according to
sales charts. We can play the songs
more for the quality of the music, and
you hear it while it is still fresh.”

This freedom to take a chance with
the new sounds, according to station
manager Chris Kramer, is largely due
to the nature of the station as
non-proﬁt".

“We don’t have to worry about
pleasing advertisers,” said Kramer.
The only form of sponsored revenue
that WPT S is generating presently is
from underwriting grants, which are
restricted commercial messages.

“Commercial radio stations have to
avoid controversy and anything that
could turn a listener off,” said Kramer.
“We don’t. If we try something new
and make a mistake, we can just laugh
it off.”

But despite the freedoms of operating
a non-proﬁt-oriented radio station, the
lines of professionalism have to be
drawn somewhere. According to
Kramer, at WPTS they are drawn with
the format. One of the biggest battles
at WPT S has been the balance between
format and fun — implementing pro-
fessional regulations to guide a student-
operated radio station. Professionalism
and freedom don’t always go hand in
hand. .

“I’ve dealt with professional radio
stations before,” said Pisula. “First of
all, they are getting paid, and also they
have their jobs all mapped out, the in-
dividual disc jockey has nothing to do
with the songs she plays.” .

EDITOR'S NOTE: The following is
the ﬁrst of a series of four stories
examining the issue of pregnancy
and considering the options
available to college women.

By Kelly Shaffer
' Assistant Features Editor

At the Pitt Student Health Ser-
vices there are an estimated 30
pregnancy tests processed a month.
According to Cheryl Miller, R.N. ,
nursing superintendent of the
Health Center, approximately 20
percent are positive.

That’s six pregnant women per
month. The statistics do not include
‘Pitt students who choose to go to
other facilities to have their
pregnancies denied or conﬁrmed.

These women, perhaps while
balancing a course load of credits
and a part—time job, are making
decisions that will affect their whole
lives.

The choices facing them are
numerous. The woman may choose
to carry her child to full-term and
then raise the child by herself. The
couple involved might decide to get

  and provide .a home for_,_the

child together.

A student might decide to give
the child up for adoption and face
the overwhelming odds of never
seeing her baby after its birth.

The pregnancy could be ter-
minated — the fetus aborted.

Students who are pregnant must
evaluate whether to continue their
education now or to interrupt their
schooling. Some never return to
ﬁnish their college education.

The decisions to be made are
momentous. Some students turn
towards friends and parents for sup-
port. Others have no one or no idea
where to turn. i

There are agencies designed to
provide support and counseling for
those in this type of crisis situation.
The University of Pittsburgh offers
the University Counseling Center
and the Forbes Clinic of the Student
Health Services.

“We are here not only for
medical advice, but to provide sup-
port for those in a crisis situation,”
Miller said. “We will sit down with
the pregnant student and help her
discover her options. We are very
careful not to recommend one
choice or another. It is important

for the student to feel that there is
no bias here.”

The University Counseling
Center will provide a list of options

- open to the woman when she
receives the results of her pregnan-
cy test. A nurse will discuss them
with her and answer any questions
about them.

“Most girls will turn to the man
involved to help them make their
decisions. The choice they opt for
might depend on the status of their
relationship. If they have just met,
their decision might be radically
different from the couple who has
had a steady relationship and plan
on marrying after graduation,” ex-
plained Miller. .

Those students who go to their
parents for help might ﬁnd the cir-
cumstances different. If the parents
are facing economic problems, they
might wish for the student to choose
a speciﬁc path. Parents might not
be able to afford to help a daughter
to raise her child alone. Perhaps
they cannot handle the ﬁnancial
burden of raising one child while
sending another to college.

“Most parents are very suppor-

tive after the initial shock.

Pregnant college women: The options and the decision

‘ ‘Most girls will turn to the man involved to help them make their
decision. The choice they opt for might depend on the status of

the relationship. ”

— Cheryl Miller, 
Student Health Services

However, their inﬂuence might be
indicative of their ﬁnancial stand-
ng,”explained Miller.

Past experience adds yet another
dimension to the decision-making
process. If a woman has been preg-
nant before, she might have deﬁnite
opinions about the fate of her un-
born child.

“If, for example, the student had
previously had an abortion, she
might feel strongly opposed to ter-
minating this pregnancy,” stated
Miller.

The student involved must also

con_sider the interruption of or end,

of her education. New babies take
time and money to raise, both of
which are main ingredients of a col-
lege education. The student may
not be willing to sacriﬁce her career

and future at this point in her life;

Psychologists suggest that .a
teenager might not be emotionally
capable of handling and rearing a
child. The student must evaluate
her ﬁtness and capabilities to rear
a child.

“Basically, the decision is made
by the woman herself after getting
input from the father, her family,

- evaluating herself and studying the

options. About 95 percent of the
students who come here for a
pregnancy test have already made
their decision,” stated Miller.
Student Health Services, Pitt’s
Counseling Center and other agen-
cies are available to the student to
discover options and to receive
counseling. However, there is real-
ly only one person who can make
such a decision: the woman who is

assistant director of music research at
B94, agrees. “There, we have to wait
until sales are up before we play
anything. Every single song is
planned weeks in advance  no ﬂex-
ibility.” V

Although WPTS does follow a cer-
tain song-rotation pattern, the format

_ structure includes albums rather than,

singles, and the music as well as the
disc jockey is able to develop a less
rigid identity.

“There isn’t any way that we could
operate totally like a professional sta-
tion,” said Boring. “We don’t pay our
disc jockeys, so we couldn’t impose

such a rigid structure.'But most of the
I jocks can settle for playing what we

want them to play anyway.”
“People have seen that the music
style of WPTS has been successful,”
said Pisula. “Now they are more ac-
ceptive and eager to play it.” Format
also allows for consistency, and con-
sistency, according to Boring, is what
attracts listeners. '
“People like format, they like hear-
ing songs that they are familiar with,”
said Boring. “They like to know what
kind of music they are going to hear.”
Michael Michalski has a different

,.idea of format. He has been a disc
jockey at WPTS for the last three.

years. “When you depend on consis-
tency too much, you become more
wrapped-up in the format than in the
listeners,” said Michalski. “I think
consistency has a lot to do with
listeners. How can you consider the
listeners when you are only allowed to
play a request in a certain color?”

Michalski also disapproves of con-

forming strictly to a professional for- v

mat. ‘ ‘We are not a professional radio
station. We are not getting paid, so I
don’t think we should have that at-
titude,” said Michalski. “This is a time
to have fun, to experiment and take ad-
vantage of the freedom you have as a
college station. If you have the attitudes
of a professional radio station, obvious-
ly you are losing ‘a big part of it.”
But according to Pisula, profes-
sionalism and creativity are not so
polarized. “The side that wants to be
professional and the side that wants to
be creative are coming to terms,” said
Pisula. "I see that I can work within
the format system and still be creative.
Something can be creative and profes-
sional at the same time.” »
Kramer sees creativity in a different
light. “Creativity is within the different
personalities we have on the air. The
jocks have a lot of opportunity here to

_ display their individuality.”

“Even though the jocks only have

"one slot an hour to play anything they
want, there is considerable choice .

within the albums,” said Boring. With
the mixing, creation, and presentation
of promotionals and other programs,
Boring said that the station can exer-
cise more creative license.

“A lot of people here want to learn
how things are done bythe book,” said
Boring. “They are mostly concerned
about getting a job when they get out,
and they want to learn the right way.’ ’

“The only way we are going to learn
is by making mistakes,” said
Michalski. “I see no need for an ex-

ecutive babysitter to watch our every
I

move. We 'aren’t going to learn that
way.” ‘
Krameris idea of learning exists
more along the lines of professional
osmosis.
“The way that we learn here is

through a lot of the examples of pro- ‘-
fessional radio stations,” said Kramer. ;_

“No one is really teaching us.”

And this brings us back to the fric- '
, tion between fun and format again. i
“Sometimes, some of the directors ;
I don’t like it when people come up here
to have fun,” said Boring. “But I think 3
that friction is healthy. It’s usually easi- I

1y overcome, and it’s usually produc-

' tive.”

“Friction is good because it keeps

the energy of the station up,” said I

Pisual. “It keeps everyone constantly
proving, and the station constantly im-
proves.”

According to Pisula, the station is
improving. “There hasn’t been a day
when someone hasn’t called the station
with a compliment.”

Pittsburgh’s professional radio sta- _ _ ,
tions also seem to be standing up and 

taking notice. “We’ve heard that we’ve
made it into WDVE research reports,”
said Boring. “We think that they use
us to figure out what songs they want
to play and what words they want to
use.” ‘ .

Boring cited the WYDD in-house
“you heard it hear first” promotional

as an example. “They were citing ,
songs that we had in music logs as play- .

ing before them,” said Boring. “Pat-

ty called them to tell them, and they f
said, ‘Call us back when you get .

another 50,000 watts.’ ”

The Pitt News, October 23, A1985

YMCA _Volur_1teers bala
generosity with practicality

"By Bonnie Kartzman
The Pitt News ‘

What exactly is the motivation
behind volunteer work? The feeling of
being useful and needed comes to
mind, that is, when the beneﬁts of
one’s volunteer labor are visibly ap-
preciated. But how about when they
aren’t? What then inspires these helpers
to keep trying, even when their aid is
ineffective, or worse, rejected?

The Tutoring Program and._ the
Oakland Teen Program, both spon-
sored by the Collegiate YMCA, repre-
sent either end of the volunteer success
spectrum. Both programs recruit
volunteers to help out younger students
in the Oakland area. Yet, as beneﬁcial

as this concept sounds, only the Tutor- .

ing Program has met with any marked
success.

The 10-year-old Tutoring Program
is made up of about 50 college
volunteers, 30 of whom tutor on a one-
to-one basis for one hour ‘per week in

I the William Pitt Union. Volunteers,
usually secondary education majors,
are matched up with students having’

trouble in the volunteer’s ﬁeld of ex-
pertise. The ‘20 other volunteers par-
ticipate in two “outreach” programs,
sponsored by the Hazelwood and
Hilltop YMCAs, in which they take a
van one night per week and tutor
students in those_areas.

Maura Koenig, a junior and student
coordinator of the program, is very en-
thusiastic about its success. “I think the
individual program is very strong 
a lot of the same parents and students
come back every year. The van pro-
gram is still in its ‘planning stages, but
I think it’s getting better.” This year
Koenig is working with the principal
of Beltzhoover Elementary School. The
principal informs parents of the pro-
gram and identiﬁes students in need of
tutoring. - r

p According to sophomore tutor
Leanne Mewherter, the success of the
program stems from the visible pro-
gress of the students, as well as the

‘ ‘The kids don ’t know what they want to do with their lives.

We provide college students who do know —- hoping a positive P

attitude and even education and career goals might rub oﬁf. ’ ’

- — Paul Hanus
Program Director

Collegiate YMCA p

ﬁrsthand teaching experience it pro- .

vides. “It makes me feel pretty secure
about teaching,” she commented.
“The more I tutor, the more I realize
that I can really help.” Mewherter aids
a second grader with reading dif-
ﬁculties, who “kind of helps me, too,
in building conﬁdence,” she added.

Based on the same volunteer-help

I idea, the Oakland Teen Program was

started last year. Paul Hanus, program
director for the Pitt Ofﬁce of the Col-
legiate YMCA, feels that the program
grew out of a parental concern that
their teens needed positive role models.
‘ ‘The kids don’t know what they want
to do withtheir life,” Hanus said. “We
provide college students who do know
 hoping a positive attitude or even
educational and career goals might rub
off.” ‘

Volunteer turnout is substantial —
for many of the same reasons as with
the Tutoring Program. “Some students
are looking for experience in majors
such as education and social work.
They can see if this is what they really
want, ” Hanus explained. “Others just
like to work with kids, to get away
from the college atmosphere for a
while.” The group meets once a week
for activities like pizza or bowling, in
which the volunteers get to know the
teens.

The ingredients are there: concem-
ed college volunteers, teenagers in need

of their help and the organization to -

bring the two together. Yet, as Hanus
reports, there is only a 25-percent

follow-up rate from all the teens
originally showing interest.

Cary Starr, freshman coordinator of
the program, attributes some of the
apathy to “angimage the kids have to
uphold in their own little community;
if they come out with us, that will
wreck the image. Also, if one doesn’t
want to go, that sets off a chain reac-
tion.”

“It’s frustrating at times,” Hanus
added.“‘You have to get the kids to
trust you.”

The rewarding experience in the
Tutoring Program seems to be enough
stimulus for those volunteers who do
stay, as they are often able to witness
positive results from session to session.
Yet there has to be something more for
those in the Teen Program when they

are faced with the stagnation it is cur-

rently experiencing.

Optimism is a key factor. “There is
a lot of potential,” Starr said. “Since .

it’s a new program, it’s going to take
a while. It has a lot of growing to do
 but by the end of the semester, it
should be working better.”

“We’re trying different strategies.

We’re not giving up yet,” Hanus
added.

Starr remarked that the ﬁnal inspira- I

tion behind the Teen Program
volunteers may be the desire to do for
others what someone had once done for
them. “People helped me through a
lot,” he remembered. ‘ ‘Now I want to
help others in the same way.”
Including the Tutoring and the
Oakland Teen efforts, the YMCA
sponsors 16 volunteer programs. Those
interested in participating can obtain
brochures and applications at the
YMCA office, 730 William Pitt Union.

 president In

bietweeen teaching and earning

By John Zaphyr
Staff Writer

Ellen Mayer, national president of
the collegiate division of the
Distributive Education Clubs of
America (DECA), has an image to
uphold.

“I have to present myself as a pro-
fessional teacher intraining,” said
Mayer, a senior at the University of
Pittsburgh, “as well as a business
leader.”

Sometimes, however, the two appear
to be mutually exclusive. /

“I would like to teach in a high
school or a community college,” she

said. “But the income in business is

much greater. It comes down to, should
I go into business or should I become
a teacher?” . -

DECA is a student-centered
organization whose program of leader-
ship and personal development is
designed speciﬁcally for students
enrolled in marketing and distributive
education programs. It is a co-
curricular group and serves as an im-
portant part of the classroom instruc-
tional program. DECA’s purpose is to
assist teachers in creating learning op-
portunities for its 180,000 student
members through goal—oriented chapter
activities. ‘

”“DECA’s focus is on the teacher,”
said Mayer, “and the needs of
upgrading the standardsof both educa-
tion and teachers.” ,

Mayer’s duties as DECA’s national

president include attending lectures, '

conducting seminars on leadership and
career development and making recom-
mendations to DECA’s board of direc-
tors. “It’s a lot of work,” said Mayer,
“almost like a part-time job, and I do
feel the pressure of the position.” '
There is also the added benefit of
travel, most of which centers around
attending seminars in different cities

throughout the country. “I haven’t

really been able to go a whole lot of
places yet,” she said. “But so far I’ve
been to San Francisco and Washington,
D.C,, and I am planning to go to
Boston, Tulsa, Iowa, Atlanta and New
York City. . ~
‘ ‘I went to Washington, D.C. to par-
ticipate in DECA’s NationalOfﬁcer
training that we all had to go th_rough,_’ ’
she continued. “and I went to San
Francisco for the National Conference,
where I was selected as chairperson
collegiate DECA. They were looking
for someone with experienceiin the

Ellen Mayer, DECA Collegiate National President

' organization and a commitment to

DECA, and I guess I was that person.”
-Although her duties occupy most of
her time, she still has room for some
other activities. “I jog about 10 to 15
miles a week, and I play tennis and
ballet,” she said. “And that’s all I have
time,'really,‘to do.” .
Then there is Mayer’s education.
Since she is majoring in marketing and
distributive education, she must make
a choice after graduation between
education and business. “I would really
like to work with kids, but the oppor-
tunities for teachers are limited,” she
said. “I can get ajob in business, but
I'don’t think working in a store would
be as rewarding as working with kids.”
If teaching is in her future, Mayer
said she would want to teach in a com-
munity college or university and would
want to teach only the subject of
marketing. ‘ ‘I would really like to. teach
in a college setting because you know
that the kids who are there want to
learn,” she said. “In high school, the
kids are more or less forced to attend,
and there is a problem with motivation.
And I deﬁnitely wouldn’t want to teach
anything else but marketing.”
Marketing is a people-oriented ﬁeld
that determines consumer needs and
directs products and services to meet
those needs. It includes such activities
as" market research, product design,

promoting and advertising. To Mayer,
though, it is also something else.

“It makes something out of kids that
aren’t high achievers,” she said. “It
teaches them to be assertive and to
communicate, and it makes winners out
of kids.”

At the moment, however, there are
other topics on which she must concen-
trate. There is a major conference of
the North Atlantic Region of DECA to
prepare ‘for, and there are always
meetings to attend. For Mayer, the
motivation to continue her respon-
sibilities is easy to find.

“I’m motivated by just trying to
‘maintain the level that collegiate DECA
has achieved in past years,” shesaid.
“But I also have an incentive of travel-
ing to various conferences and meeting
inﬂuential people from various
corporations. ”

“One time I walked into a con-
ference and met a woman from a com-
pany who told me I could have a job
any timetl wanted one, and to me, that
is very motivational.”

Has the experience of becoming
president changed her at all? “I. think
I’m the same person,” she said. “I
don’t play up my position. I don’t try
to look for publicity — as a matter of
fact, I don’t enjoy giving interviews
like this one. Basically, I’m a very
private person.”

Triglia and Torrence doing well

Bethel Park
junior likes
competition

By Linda Mesko
For The Pitt News

When’ University of Pittsburgh soc- .

cer player Joe Triglia was born, he
came out kicking. The junior from
Bethel Park has been playing com-
petitively since he was ten years old,
and all of those years of practice are
paying off as Triglia helped his team-
mates earn an impressive 8-1-1 record
so far this season.

“I started playing soccer because all
my friends played when we were little
kids,” said Triglia. “I really enjoy the
game, but my life doesn’t revolve
around soccer. I have other interests as
well.”

Those other interests include art; he

loves to draw and paint, and he enjoys

reading and music, which he says rea1--

ly helps him to relax.

‘ ‘I ’m not one of those athletes who’s
driven by glory. My ego doesn’t need
to be fed,” said Triglia. “I play soc-
cer because it’s ﬁm and challenging and
I like being part of a team. We’re all
pretty good friends and that makes it
even more enjoyable.”

Triglia, whose major at Pitt is infor-
mation science, says his laid-back at-
titude about his sport stems from the
fact that his parents never pushed him
to pursue it’.

‘ ‘They wanted me to be interested in
something, but they didn’t care what
it was. When I decided I liked soccer,
they encouraged me to play if it made
me happy, but they were never pushy.
It was my decision to play or not to
play. I think that’s why I treat it the
way I do. I love the sport, but if it
wasn’t soccer I’d be involved with
something else.”

Despite his simple approach to his
sport, Triglia works hard in both prac-
tice and games to improve his soccer
play. He’s started in three games this
season, and has seen a good amount of
playing time due to his hard work and
dedication. His improvements, as‘ well
as those of his teammates, have paid
off in terms of an outstanding record
this season.

Joe Triglia

“I’m happy with how much I’ve
been playing,” said Triglia. “Also,
starting in three games was very satis-
fying for me. I feel ‘good about the
progress I've made and with the prog-
ress made by the team.”

“We’re having a great season,
beating a lot of really good schools with
strong soccer programs. We want to
keep winning and, more importantly,
we want to keep having fun.”

Injuries force Fazio
to prepare for worst

Pitt head coach Foge Fazio ﬁnds
himself with a shortage of running
backs as he takes his team to An-
napolis, Md. , this weekend for a game
against the Naval Academy.

Last week’s occurrences — a hard-
hitting win over Rutgers and having
watched two tailbacks leave the team
because of a lack of playing time —
leave Fazio with some heavy thinking
to do. _-

‘ Tailback Brian Davis suffered a ‘deep
bruise to his quad muscle in the Rutgers
game and will not play this weekend.
Fazio explained that the only real treat-
ment for Davis’ injury is rest. He will
work on getting plenty of that in the
next few days.

Also on the injury list is sophomore .

Zeke Gadson. Gadson, who also will
not play this weekend, separated his
shoulder in the second half of the

, Rutgers game.

With all the injuries and with A.B.
Brown and Eugene Napolean since
departed. Fazio has had to make some

.drastic moves. Flanker Chuck Scales
has been practicing at tailback this
week, and safety Billy Owens has also
been farniliarizing himself with the Pitt
offense. They will back up banged-up
starter Charles Gladman at tailback.

The fullback . situation is not as
drastic. Both Tom Brown and Darnell
Stone are close to being completely
healthy, but beyond them, there is not
much left. Fazio moved special teams
demon Nate Heyward to fullback.

“I was very pleased with the way
things turned out in the Rutgers game,”
Fazio said, but he grimaced when he
saw the injury report.

Fazio indicated that Owens, a red-
shirt sophomore from Syracuse, N.Y. ,

will see a great deal of time at free safe-
'ty should Troy Washington not be able
to play. That would mean that Owens
would-play both offensively and defen-
sively. “Billy realizes that he might
have to play both ways, and he is pret-
ty ﬁred up about it,” Fazio noted. ‘

The last time a Pitt player went both
ways was-against Penn State last year
when Bill Fralic played on the defen-
sive line in Pitt’s 31-1 1 victory. Maybe

"that is a sign of things to come.

Unfortunately for Fazio, running
back is not the only position where Pitt
is hurting. Center Barry Pettyjohn,
who had been quietly consistent all year
long, has been lost for the year with
an injury to his left knee. He was in
Presbyterian-University Hospital
yesterday where he had arthroscopic

. surgery performed on his knee. Left at
the center position are sophomores
Chip Backauskas and Bobby Sign.

“We may just stick with Backauskas
at center,” Fazio said yesterday. “We
are also going to have Bobby Sign work
out a little bit there.”

Also on the injury list is linebacker
Brian Shields (sprained right ankle) and
receiver Michael Stewart (bruised left
bicep), who are both doubtful for play
this weekend.

With a sellout crowd of over 30,000
expected -— 4,500 of which will be
from Pitt — Fazio will be dipping into
the bottom of the well for all he can
get. Gladman, currently ranked_ ninth
in the nation with an average of 115.8
yards per game, will have the weight
of the running game on his shoulders
once again. But if he goes down, and
knock on wood when you read this,
there could be some problems at
tailback for Pitt.

Pitt goalie a
ﬁxture in the
record books

By John Enright
For The Pitt News

Dave Torrence, the starting
goalkeeper for the Pitt soccer team,
recently broke two school records and
is a vital player on a team that is striv-
ing for the playoffs.

Torrence, a senior from Arlington,
Va., broke the career shutout record
against Mercyhurst in a 1-0 victory on
Sept. 11. The shutout was the 15th in
Torrence’s career, breaking the
previous mark held by Frank Bucci,
who played herefrom 1974 to 1976.
Exactly one month later, he shattered
the season shutout mark of six in a
scoreless tie against West Virginia. The
shutout increased Torrence’s career
total to 20.

Head Coach Joe Luxbacher is not
surprised by his star goalie’s success.
‘ ‘Dave had the right temperament to be
a good goalkeeper. He works hard and
he is conﬁdent. Dave is not a vocal
leader. He leads by his play on the
ﬁeld. Game in and game out, he is
solid.” Obviously Torrence enjoys his
position. “I really like playing
goalkeeper. I am a naturally aggressive
person and you need to be aggressive
to play it. I have the ability to see the

. whole field. I get involved in a lot of

defensive plays and in organizing the
defense. I get to play a more physical
game than some of the other positions
and I have more freedom,” he said.

Torrence, a chemical engineering
major, was a steady performer last year
but has improved since then. Accord-
ing to Coach Luxbacher, “One im-
provement is that he’s excellent on high
balls near the goal. He is virtually
ﬂawless on stopping balls kicked high
in front of the net.”

The Panthers are enjoying a suc-
cessﬁll season, but they will have to
play well to continue their winning
_ways. Torrence, for one, feels the team
IS ready. ‘ ‘We’re getting on top of our
game, ” he said. “We’re deﬁnitely past
the easy pan of our schedule. Now we
have to play to our ability to win.’ ’ The
Panthers can count on Dave Torrence
to do just that.

The Sporting Life

By Bob Travers

CMU football teamon top of the polls

It’s hard to believe that the semester
is already half over. But here it is the
middle of October, and mid-terms are
crashing down upon us from all sides.
In light of the fact that you have been
doing some heavy-duty reading these
past few weeks, this column will re-
quire an attention span of no more than
a few seconds for each item:

0 The one person I really admire but
would not want to be is John McEnroe.
As the best tennis player in the world,
McEnroe has an impossible time of it.
Everything he does is national news,
and he can’t get a minute alone for
himself and his girlfriend, Tatum
O’Neal. Of course, I do wish I had his
money. '

0 My favorite play in the NFL this
year was the Bears’ William “The
Refrigerator’ ’ Perry up the middle for
three yards and a rather large cloud of
dust.

0 One thing I wish there was more
of is college hockey on ESPN. I also
wish there was less auto racing on that
network. As long as we’re on the sub-
ject of ESPN, how can the top ex-
ecutives live with themselves after forc-
ing Chris “The Nicknamer” Berman
to cool it? He is the funniest sports-
caster on the air anywhere.

0 Pound for pound, the best team in

' Oakland is the No. 1 ranked Tartans

of Carnegie-Mellon (Division III). The
team down the street remains unbeaten. A

0 The Iowa-Michigan game last
Saturday was the best college football
game I ’ve seen since the 1984 Orange
Bowl when Miami stopped Nebraska
31-30. '

0 The Heisman candidates are all
rolling right along. The front ‘runner
now has to be Bo Jackson, but if Iowa
stays unbeaten, look for Chuck Long
to get the lion’s share of the votes —
especially from the numerous Big 10
area writers (Chicago, Cincinnati,
Cleveland, Indianapolis).

0 The question now seems to be, in
what manner will Gerry Faust make his

exit from under the Golden Dome? I »

hope he hangs around. He is one of the
few honest men left in college athletes.
Besides, there is not a coach on this
planet who could win with the schedule
the.Irish play. Anybody can win with
Oklahoma’s schedule. (I will never

"forgive Barry Switzer for chickening

out of playing BYU twice in the past
year — last season in the Holiday Bowl
and this year in the Kickoff Classic.
What are you afraid of, Barry?

0 There is still something special
about a high school football game on
a crisp Friday night. And I don’t care
who’s playing.

0 So now Bobby Cox, ex-Blue Jays
manager, is joining Chuck Tanner, the
GM in Atlanta. The Braves will be in
the playoffs within two years.

NFL Roundup

0 If Penn State keeps winning close
games all season (every Lions game
this year has been decided by a margin
of seven points or less) all its fans are
going to be needing Penn State hearts
by this time Bowl bids come out in
November.

0 Patrick Ewing got in a ﬁght in one
of his first exhibition games with the
Knicks over the weekend. I’ll bet it
isn’t the last fight Ewing is involved in
this year.

0 I think there is something wrong

~?;

with me —— there are times when I ac- (-

tually enjoy watching golf on
television. a

0 One day I woke up with this ques-
tion on my mind: If they domed Pitt
Stadium, what would they call it? The
PittDome, PantherDome, Oakland-
Dome, LassieComeDome??? No, no,
that last one was just a joke. I would
call it the ThunderDome and get Tina
Turner to come out and do the national
anthem every week.

0 Tony Robinson of Tennessee is the
most exciting quarterback I’ve seen this
season.

0 Jim Everett of Purdue, however, ‘

is the best. I think he’ll_be the first
quarterback taken in next year’s NFL
draft, and rightly so.

Well enough of this. It’s time to get
back to the books.

By Thomas Danyluk

Week seven unlucky for division leaders

Week seven of the NFL season pro-
vided fans with an abundance of thrill-
ing moments and a surprising number
of upsets. Four division leaders were
beaten, tightening the races in all but
the NFC Central and West, where the
Bears and Rams hold the comfortable
leads. Here’s a quick look.

The Cowboys’ lack of respect for
Philadelphia resulted in a 16-14 loss to
the surging Eagles. Dallas running
back Tony Dorsett showed his ar-
rogance by taunting Eagle defenders
after he scored a third-period
touchdown. This tacky display of
triumph succeeded in rousing the
already inspired Eagles as Philadelphia
went on to win their second game in
as many weeks.

New England caught the Jets look-
ing back to their Monday night win
over Miami and shocked the visitors
20-13. Steve Grogan, starting in place
of injured quarterback Tony Eason,
lifted his teammates to victory with a
three-yard bootleg touchdown late in
the fourth quarter.

A Marc Wilson touchdown pass to
Todd Cristensen with 30 seconds left
in regulation time lifted the L.A.
Raiders past the stubborn Cleveland

Browns in a hard-fought defensive
brawl at Cleveland’s Municipal
Stadium. The Browns were defeated
after an almost ﬂawless defensive per-
formance, holding the Raiders
scoreless for 29‘/2 minutes of the sec-
ond half. The victory enabled the
Raiders to keep pace with the Denver
Broncos for the lead in the AFC West.

Detroit surprised the heavily-favored
San Francisco 49ers 23-21 before
67,715 fans in the Pontiac Silverdome.
The 49er quarterback Joe Montana,
striken with the ﬂu, helped the Detroit
cause by compiling a mere 97 yards
through the air. The slumping San
Franciscans are now four games behind
the undefeated Rams in the NFC West.

The Buffalo Bills horsewhipped In-
dianapolis 21-9 before 28,430
masochists in Orchard Park, N.Y. The
win avenged an earlier 32-point tram-
pling under the hooves of the Colts on
Oct. 6. Runningback Joe Cribbs of the
Bills made his ﬁrst appearance since re-
joining the club after a brief stint in the
USFL.

Chuck Noll has to be relieved. His
3-4 Steelers, behind a fabulous defen-
sive effort. belted St. Louis and

moved to within a game of first—place
Cleveland in the AFC Central. The vic-
tory ended three weeks of markups in
the loss colurrm for Pittsburgh. Still,
the play at quarterback resembles a
Three Stooges Film Festival.

In a thriller at the Orange Bowl, a
field goal by Miami kicker Fuad Reveiz
with six seconds on the clock spoiled
Tampa Bay’s hopes for an upset. The
Bucs, 41-38 losers, clawed back from

‘a 17-point deficit to tie the contest, only

to have victory elude them for the
seventh time this season. The Dolphins
regained, a share of ﬁrst place in the
AFC Eastern Division.

The 49ers were not expected to win
Super Bowl XX, but they we_ren’t ex-
pected to fall ﬂat on their faces either.
San Francisco has been going down
almost passively, and that’s what
troubles head coach Bill Walsh. The
medical term for the 49ers ailment is
“post-Palo Alto chronic complacen-
c .”
yJoe'Theismann on the Redskins’ for-
tunes: “Every cloud has a silver lin-
ing, but I’m getting tired of singing in

the rain.” Joe, its gonna get a lot wet-

ter before the season is over.

The Pitt News, Ociober 23, 1985

Athlete of the Week

By Randy Miller

Teryl Austin

Thanks to the resurgence of the Pitt
pass defense, the Panthers are 4-2-1
and riding a three—game winning
streak. _

Cornerback Teryl Austin, though on-
ly a sophomore, has become a leader
of the secondary. Last week in the
38-10 win at Rutgers, Austin set up two
scores with an interception and a daz-
zling punt return.

Austin is the Pitt News Athlete of the
Week for his ﬁne all-around play
against Rutgers.

“Teryl is deserving of the award,”
Coach Foge Fazio said. “He’s really
starting to play up to his capabilities.
Last week he played really well up at
Rutgers.”

With Pitt leading 7-0 in the second
quarter and Rutgers moving the foot-
ball, Austin came up with consecutive
big plays to stop the drive.

With a second-and-20 at the Pitt
49-yard line, Rutgers quarterback Joe
Gagliardi found halfback Reynold
Walbrook open on a screen pass.

Austin, however, moved up from his
cornerback position to nail Walbrook
after a gain of only two yards.

On third down, Gagliardi decided to
test Austin deep, but he was ready for
the challenge. Austin stuck like glue to
Rutgers receiver Scott Drake before
picking the ball off at the 12-yard line
and returning it to the Pitt 28-yard line.
It was his fourth interception of the
season, which kept him one ahead of
Ducky Lewis for the team lead. Pitt
went on to score a touchdown on the
possession following the Austin in-
terception.

On the kickoff preceding Pitt’s sec-
ond touchdown, Austin again stood
out. Rutgers kick returner Eric Young
found a seam through the middle of the
field and appeared to be on his way to
a 91-yard touchdown return. Austin
was theonly defender between Young
and the Pitt end zone.

Austin dove toward the speeding
Young to save the touchdown with a
shoestring tackle. Austin also set up a
Mark Brasco field goal with a 27-yard

Pitt’s top defensive players. Austin is this week’s Pitt News

, Athlete of the Week.

punt return in the fourth quarter.

“Teryl is a threat anytime he touches
the ball,” defensive back coach
Walters said. “We’re very happy with
his progress in punt returns. He has the
knack of being able to find the open
spot." '

“It’s fun to return kicks,” Austin
added. “I like the dare that comes with
it.”

Everything to Austin is fun —— when
it comes to football. “I like Teryl
because he loves the game of football, ”
Fazio said.

“He keeps the guys loose,” Walters
said. “He really enjoys practice. The
other players see this, and [it] relaxes
them.”

In a sense, Austin has become a
leader in the secondary in only his
sophomore season. Since he became a
starter prior to the West Virginia game,
the Pitt defense went from one of the
nation’s worst to becoming No. 24.

“Teryl has really been the catalyst
in our secondary, ’ ’ Walters said. “He
tends to lead not verbally but by exam-
ple.”

“I like seeing myself as a leader,”
Austin said. “I like being in charge
when I’m on the ﬁeld, [making] sure
everyone is in the right place.”

Earlier in the season when the pass
defense was virtually extinct, the
defenders weren’t always in the right
position, according to Austin. ‘ ‘Coach
Walters and all the defensive backs had
a little meeting the Sunday following
the Boston College game,” Austin ex-
plained. “He said he was disappointed
in us. What we decided was we had too
many coverages. Someone was always
out of position or in a different
coverage. We simplified everything.”

With less coverages to worry about
and the fact that Fazio began working
extra hard with the defense, the results
have been victories.

Austin’s best asset to the Pitt team,
however, is his ability to cover
receivers. His efforts have been so suc-
cessful that many oppositions are not
even attempting to pass in his direction.

“Teryl’s beginning to get respect, ”
Walters said. “ Teams look at the films
and see he istough to throw on. Ever
since he became a starter earlier this
season, Teryl has really improved.”

Pitt opponents, beware: Don’t even
try to pass on Teryl Austin. It won’t
be long before every team has the
scoop. V

Honorable Mention: Mike Grimes,
a 5-9, 155-lb. junior on the soccer team
from Lexington, Ky., scored two goals
last Saturday against Georgetown.
Grimes has three goals and three assists
on the season.

Lisa Stewart, a sophomore on the Pitt
volleyball squad who transferred from
Tennessee, was a member on the All-
Tournament team in the Pitt Classic.
