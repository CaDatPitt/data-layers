Klein, a junior majoring in political sci-
ence and communications. On Friday
afternoon, Klein participated in the
Army, Naval and Air Force Joint
Services Parade held on the Cathedral of
Learning lawn. A ‘ 1

P But, the event wasn’t a parade in the
traditional sense.The Joint _ Services

Parade was a formal review of the '

ROTC students by their commanders.
The University of Pittsburgh chapters of
the Army and Air Force ROTC partici-

pated, along with the Carnegie Mellon of

Naval ROTC. .

Klein, the comgmanderrof troops in
Pitt’s ' Air Force ROTC program,
explained thatthe “parade” is simply a
formal review of troops where the par-
ticipants march and drill for comman-
ders. Gen. George ‘Washington started
the practice during the Revolutionary
War when he ordered a review of his
forces. "'“

Air Force R,OTCvpro'gram said that one
of the reasons they continue the parade is

to develop a sense of team work, under-.
’ standing and collaboration among: the J

branches of the armed forces, which she

said is essential. She added that the drills ‘
executed at the parade‘ require rigorous ~

“Not only did the ROTC students
participate, but Central Catholic High
School marching band performed while

' Judge John Brosky of the Superior
Court of Pennsylvania was the guest
speaker at the event. Brosky attended
undergraduate‘ school at Pitt, graduated
from Pitt’s law school and is a decorated
World War II veteran. He spoke about
the importance of ' maintaining and

~ improving America’s war readiness and -

commended the students’ on their partic-
ipation in the armed forces. _

ROTC programs at Pitt are actually
“joint programs” because theyare open
to Pitt, CMU, Duquesne and other area .
college students. Pitt rims the Army and
Air Force programs, while CMU oper-

. ates the Naval program. Students can

join the ROTCtprogram of their choice
regardless of its _location.

ROTC students spend "several hours
a week in physical training. ‘Staff Sgt.
Edward Stewart of the Army ROTC pro-
gram said ROTC students are required to
complete physical training three morn-
ings a week and must also take speciﬁed
coursework. Several students from the
Naval ROTC said they have taken cours-
es on professionalism and personal
development." 4 ,

All three programs offer a wealth. of
scholarship opportunities to interested
students. For more information, contact

No mixing on   “The Hill”

‘ Council’s vice president argues that

CHRISTINA‘ KEFALOS‘

Staff Writer  ‘ -

Kelly ’ Craig, Chi Omega’s
pledge educator,’ remembers the
convenience of catching a campus
shuttle to and from a mixer, a pri-
vate party between a fraternity and
a sorority. . . '

Now she may have to rely on a

‘cab to attend a mixer that may be
held somewhere in the South Side

or-rthe Strip District.

The Panhellenic ‘Association.
l1as prohibited all of its sororities ,

from attending »a mixer with a fra-

ternity on campus wherevalcohofl is _

involved. _ . , A

“I haven’t experienced the con-
sequences of it yet, but we do lose
the convenience of just taking a
shuttle,” Craig said. ‘ i

In order to have a mixer, the
two groups must find a third-party
vendor to host the event.
Establishments such as C. J.
Barney’s on__ Forbes -Avenue may
provide an outlet nearcampus, but
Greek organizations now have to
consider areas such as the South
Side. or the Strip District.

Some students feel that unless
the third party vendor provides a

" private room for mixers, there will

be no control over who is‘at -the
party. "Others said the change might
be for the better-

“It’s all right. We don’t have to
clean up,” said Jared Shelly, a Phi
Kappa Theta brother. “It’s— a good
thing.”

Dan- Darling, Interflraternity

THE.Pl'l'l'NEWS , .  _-.3

the convenience has been removed
from the mixers.

“I like mixers, but I don’t like .

the ‘fact we have to go off campus
to have them,’7' Darling said.

Just as alcohol is controlled at a
mixer in a fraternity house, the

same rules will apply when the‘

events are held elsewhere.
A Students will be "carded, and
bracelets or stamps will be distrib-

uted to underagestudents attending '

the mixer. I ~-

Whereas fraternitieshave tradi- V

tionally paid for mixers,,sororities
now mustpay. half the cost. . ,
 -‘,‘-It’s  only fair,’,’ Craig ‘said.
?‘You can’t, expect_the,__fr-aternity to
foot the bill, especially now with
the added costs.” I  T
Another issue that surrounds
the idea of the third party vendors
involves the safety of the students.
During regional conferences held
Downtown last spring, speakers
from the National Panhellenic
Council said that students would be
safer off campus than on campus.
Some Greek members disagree.
“The campus is a lot safer,” said
Jennifer Katz, internal’ vice presi-
dent of the Panhellenic Association.
She added that no reason was given

from NPC _on why it said mixers are

safer off campus.

Despite the new rule, mixers

will still be a part of Greek life.‘
“No fun will be taken out of
[the mixer], you’ll still be with the
fraternity you want to mix with,”
‘said Kappa Kappa Gamma sister
Dana Sharp. ' '

Studentsstage pro-

RdB_ GEBHART

 

Staff Writer

A group of 10 members of the
Students for Reproductive Freedom
held a demonstration. yesterday after-
noon to counter the annual Life Chain
abortion protest, a national pro—life
event. C , .

The demonstrators, eight women
and two men,‘ leaned on the railing

along the FifthsAvenue bus lane and

waved signs reading, "‘Kecp ‘your
laws off my body,” and “Cram it,
Churchie” at passing-automobiles.
Reproductive Health “member
Monica Harzbergstood on the corner
holding her sign high above her head:
“Honk for choice, raise your voice.”
“Lots. of people are honking and

waving,” she said. “More people are.

supportingius than giving us the fin-

ger. » ' .

“And lots of pedestrians stop and"

talk to you,” she said. .- .
As she said that", a man stopped
beside her and asked, “What choice?”
,“Choice for abortion,” an elderly
woman‘sai_d, as-shyye passed through.
Theman shrugged and. walked away,
seemingly indifferent to the topic.
‘ However, her was an exception.

As the pI'0'?1ifC supporters gathered,

‘along the sidewalk . from North

' Neville almost to Bigelow Boulevard,

passing motorists indicatedtheir sup-

'port=with horn-blasts and thumbs—up

directed towards their preferred side.
“My body, -my choice,” one
woman yelled out her window. '

‘,‘God bless. Lord bless you,” a.

man called from his Buick.

But not everyone kept their calm
in the midst of the protest.

Julie Diskin, 10, came into town
from the North Hills with her mother
and sister to participate in the Life
Chain rally. She stood quietly on the

corner of North Bellefield and Fifth ‘ H
avenues holding a sign that read, 1

“Abortion. kills children.” ~
A driver screamed obscenities in
Julie’—s direction. ' T '
Julie ‘stood her ground and held.

her sign steady.

“I s thought, she shouldn’t have i
done that. She docsn”t know what the ~
Wmammas and the babies go through,”

Julie said. 1

The SFRF member cheered

‘wildly every time someonehonkcd in

‘support of their cause. i ,
p Though they were greatly out-
numbered by their opponents, the

group’s protests were filled with

noise andmotion. .

, _Members ran along all f/ou
blocks chanting, “Not the church, not
the state, women will decide their
fate,” and “‘Pro—life’ your name’s a
lie, you don’t care if women die!”

Christine Reed, _ president of

‘Reproductive Freedom said that the

group was present to show people not

everyone is anti—choice., _ .
She said she wanted to debunk’

myths about abortion and maybe help

some people understand why abortion H

is a necessary option for women.

“A lot of people don’t understand
that if abortion is made illegal it
won’t stop people from having ab..or'—r
tions,” Reed said. “It will just cause

more ‘women to die from illegal '
, ones.” 1

John , Serbicki, the vice president of
Students for Life, agrees that it is important
for men to be interested in this issue.

“It’s his ‘child also, even though he
doesn’t physically carry it,” said Serbicki,
who wore a T shirt which read “Life — the
first inalienable right.” ‘ ;

Other people from the Pittsburgh area
such as Lisa Pugliano, who ‘graduated from
Pitt in 1992, came alone to independently
make a statement. V

“There are many different groups

here,” said Pugliano, who works with ’

teenagers as a youth minister at her church.
Pugliano said the rally was an important

i way to unite people who think that life is

as bad,” Newman said.

‘.‘You never know who this will affect,

‘even someone mentioning it to someone

else,” she said.

‘ Bob Newman, ﬁom Upper St. Clair,
said that he was there to make people
aware thatl.5 million babies -are aborted
every year. I ‘ ‘_

Newman and manyothers at the event
were strongly opposed to RU486, a pill
developed in France that can beused as a
method of early abortion that was recently
approved by the Food and Drug
Administration. ’

“VV1th this new pill, the material can be.

gotten rid of when it is just the size of a
grain of rice,” said Newman, who held a

large picture of a newborn -on a poster

made to look like a Lifeimagazine cover.
“They call it material so it won’t sound

Tarcson agrees with. Newman and

‘ believes that abortion is wrong under any A

circumstances. - V

“It’s a life no matter what way you
lookat it and it just can’t be taken‘lightly,”
she said. '

Pugliano said that the RU486» pill
makes taking a life an even easier proce-
dure than it is already.“It could make peo-
ple morecareless, and that could make it
more dangerous,” said Pugliano. “But I’m
aware that many people don’t see it as
being dangerous.” g

Ben Farren, a recent Pitt graduate who
participated in the Life Chain last year and
held a sign which stated‘ simply that
“Abortion Kills Children,” said that he is
disappointed with the approval of the
RU486 pill, but isn’t convinced that the pill
will make the process easier.

“I’m not even sure it will make things
easier,” Farren said. “It might, it’s worri-
some to me because it is another route.”

Farren added that although he is not

completely sure how he feels about abor-

tions under certain circumstances, he is

deﬁnitely against the majority of them, V
specifically those performed out of conve- '

nience. '
Although negative responses to the

demonstration -like people shouting

obscenities were not as common as posi-

- tive honking horns, occasionally, negative

responses were extreme. V
Ten—year—old Julie Diskin, who attend-

ed the rally with her mother, was cursed at A
by a woman  a, passing car.

“That’s my mom’s choice.” Diskin
said. Diskin said she wondered how some-
one would chose to abort a child when their

’ mother could have done the same to them.

Serbicki said that he was pleased with

the day’s tumout. I

A “I’m pretty happy because we’re a
small group and a lot of people don’t even

know we exist,” he said. V -

Tarcson said that she hoped her pur-
pose was made clear to passers by, and that
by standing in silence, they were ‘able to
make more of an impact. .

“In the one hour we were standing
here, 180 babies were murdered,” Tarcson
said.

    OPINIONS  
9 EDITORIAL  

  Students can learn from the
tragic fire on North Craig Street

“Our generation has grown up

  with Smokey /Bear and the knowl-

edge that only we can prevent forest

4 ﬁres. Many of our parents repeated
, the mantra ‘,‘don’t play with matches”

as frequently as they told us to play
quietly or stop pulling our siblirigs’
hair. In elementary school we learned

. » to stop, drop and roll and to plan alter-
. nate upon alternate plan of escape

routes from our home, should the dis-
aster of ﬁre befall us. ' ’

’ We don’t always carry these
lessons with us as young adults and
collegians, though. And usually it

‘ doesn’t matter. Most days we can tum

off our smoke alarms and complain

9 about how annoying ﬁre drills are,
without thinking twice about it. '

_ Fire is not a part of our everyday
lives, thoughts or worries — until a
tragedy occurs, such as the ﬁre that
virtually consumed an apartment on
North Craig Street early Friday mom-
ing. Seven Pitt students and one
University employee lived in that
building, including Joseph Marcinek,
a senior who was killedin the’ ﬁre.

- We can learn from this. It doesn’t
makethe event any less tragic, and it
won’t do much to ease the suffering
of those who were affected —— but we,
the students of Pitt, can _leam some-
thing nonetheless. ‘ 4 _ .

Take fire safety » seriously;

. remember what you learned in grade.

school and put that advice into action.
Make sure you have a smoke alarm
andpmake sure it works. Like locking
your door or brushing your teeth, dou-
b1e—checking your smoke alarm
should be part of everyone’s bedtime
routine. 7 A ~ ‘

Off-campus housing is often old
and overcrowded. Students should be
sure to ask their landlord about escape
routes and ﬁre safety options before
signing a lease. Those living in dorms
should also learn all of their escape

options and approach ﬁre drills with .
an earnest and serious attitude.

Finally, in the event of ﬁre, check
on roormnates and neighbors if this is

  atall possible.

, Thursday’s tragedy cannot be
erased. The University, thankfully, is’
doing all it can to support the students
who lived in the _ , building.
Representatives from the Counseling
Center met students at the police sta-
tion immediately following the ﬁre.
Also, residents were offered free
University housing and provided with
clothes and replacement books.

This is all we can do: help the stu-
dents whose lives were severely dis-

rupted and make a greater effort to V
prevent ﬁre in our ‘own lives, and_in .

doing so, honor the memory of Joe
Marcinek. T ‘

in education, focus on joy over stress

‘ We have begun to create a new social elite
in America One based not on wealth, inﬂuence,
fame_or technology, but one that instead can lead

to all these trappings of power. It is a system of _

intelligence, where one’s various test scores pro-
vide a layout for the future of every citizen. The
lucky few among the many go through college to
cement their positions in the intelli-
gentsia. .

It all begins in high school,
where SAT scores and grade-point
averages are the only marks of suc- C
cess that will allow people to move
on. The popular football "star who slept through
class will soon be the popular local car 

  

while his more studious and academically talent-

ed classmates can go on to bigger and better
things 7  
' It seems the Puritan education ethicﬁnally
paid off in the information age, where-the third

: wave has swept Americans to the height of world

power. We must remember all the poor farming
children who had their hands mercilessly
slapped with rulers before learning about things

. they would never see in their lives. After laying

the foundation for our information mania, they
slipped back to their lives with just enough time
to pass on their ethos to the next generation. ,
But a college education has now become a
cure-all for the student who wants to make more
money, ﬁnd direction in life,‘ make contacts for
future businesses, ﬁnd a good spouse, inflict his

orher sense of art upon others or gain a position V

In some respects, a college degree is just a
piece of paper to hang on the wall, but it is‘also a
"passport to higher pay at better jobs and the sort
of exposure to life that prevents people from

Vmaking fools of themselves on talk-radio pro-

But rmdergtaduate study is a sort of educa-
tional phantasm, not quite as easy to deﬁne and
quantify as the ‘piece of paper everybody
receives at the end While small schools boast of

tives from the spectrum in between to make
themselves stand out in the ﬂood of college pam-
phlets aniving weekly in high school seniors’
mailboxes. -

In the end, you can get whatever you want 7

from whatever college you choose, if you put
enough effort into it. Small community colleges
offer the essentials of education; the
only real difference is a self-right-
’ eous indignation on behalf of “real”
college students that some people
would presume to get an education
without spending tens of thousands

 
  

of dollars.

The other happy bonus‘ people will have
purchased with their money is a much spifﬁer
name on their degree. Students at Harvard get
only a marginally superior education than those
everywhere else at the undergraduate level. They

also have the added pressures of insane academ— ~

ic stress and a higher potential for suicide after
failure, which makes sense since their life has
really ended. Flunking has become a honible
prospect, condemning people to being the under-
lings of those stupid popular football players at
the used car lot.

Fortunately, training and knowledge can
help people get good jobs. And it’s also helpful
to our nation. Presidential candidates that
promise a greater number of people pursuing
higher education are eyeing the improved social

* positionsof America The university system is a

sort of social-evolution virtue that allows a cul-

ture to improve technology and permits the

exchange of ideas.‘

As the college experience becomes more of
a business and less of an idealized higher, pursuit,
more of an industrial process than a time of indi-
vidual growth, more of an opportunity to gain
status than a time for contemplation, we students
lose so many chances to_ enjoy our time here.
VV1th the pressures of parents and professors and
the looming real world, it’s easy to rush past the
roses of life. Don’t sacriﬁce the joy of these next
few years for a slightly better resume.

that we need.” '

“It may just be more than what I was expect-

The'Pitt News

The. Pitt men’s soccer team
picked up another road win last
Friday, coming from behind to defeat
Notre Dame, 3-2. Senior Spencer
Barton scored. all three goals for the
Panthers, as they improved their
record to 8-1 overall and 4-1 in the
Big East.

Barton scored his first goal about
5 1/2 "minutes into the first period.

After getting the ball from senior,

Chad‘ Porter, who had an assist on the
play, Barton lofted a shot over the
head of Notre Dame goalkeeper Greg
Tait. 1
Even though they were outshot‘9-
4 in the first period, and 15-8 for the
game, the Panthers, who were ranked

015th going into the game, held on to

a 1-0 lead. ,

“We were very fortunate to have
the lead going into‘ the second half,”
Pitt coach Joe Luxbacher said. “I felt
they played better than us in the first
half and had more momentum going
into the second.”

The Irish used that momentum in
the second period, when Erich Braun
tied the game at 7:22. The Irish then
went ahead a minute later when
Griffen Howard slipped a shot by

. the season. According to Luxbacher,-

Panther goalkeeper Justin Gaul, who
had three saves on the day.

The ‘Panthers _c_ame right back-
and tied the game at 2-2. Barton’s
second goal of the game, past a div-
ing Tait, was unassisted. Tait had two g
saves, as the Irish dropped their third
Big East home game in a row.

“The goal that tied it was huge
because it stopped their momentum
and helpedus get back in the game,”
Luxbacher said. “It was also areally
great “goal.” 5 . -_

Barton finished the scoring with
11 minutes remaining in the game.
The goal, assisted by Porter and ’
junior Mark Sikora, ‘was Barton’s
fifth of the season and put the
Panthers on top for good, 3-2.

‘‘I think we played a lot better in
the. second half,” Luxbacher said.’
“N otre Dame is’ better than their
record .suggests, and we had a lot of
great chances. Our goalkeeper came .
up big-towards the end,” '

The win was Pitt’s second in a_
row after suffering their only. loss of.

the Panthers will need to build
momentum going into what he called

8-1 on the season “

Three Rivers Stadium 1 goes, noutiin style  

' After nine hard-fought innings of baseball, a

chapter of Pittsburgh sports history closed "last
night as the Pittsburgh‘ Pirates lost to the Chicago
Cubs in the final baseball game at Three Rivers
Stadium.

The game, however, represented much more
than just three-plus hours of baseball. The contest
between the National League Central division
rivals was the end of an era here in Pittsburgh.
Three Rivers Stadium hosted the All-Star Game and
the World Series, the two biggest spec- l
tacles in the game of baseball. _.

The Pirates said goodbye to the
30-year-old ballpark in grand fash-
ion, with a pre—game sh'ow»featur-ing - L ,
Sister Sledge and a post-game ceremo- L" t
ny with various Pirates’ greats, ranging
from Don Robinson to Willie Stargell. It
was Starge1l’s appearance, at the end of the
night, that brought many of the 55,000 fans
in attendance to tears. ’

After “The Voice of the Pirates,” Lanny -
Frattare, introduced Kent Tekulve and Jason
Kendall to participate in the final pitch at the sta-
dium, Tekulve told the crowd that he was not
deserving of the honor. Then, coming out of the
Pirates dugout, was No. 8, Stargell. A rousing ova-
tion from the crowd showed who the most popular
Pirate was that night.

Another great show of respect from the fans
was when Pirates» manager ‘Gene Lamont was intro-

read this will most likely be the former manager of
the team, got a standing ovation-from the crowd.

Lamont, while not exactly revered by. the fans of

the Bucs, is and always has been one of the most,
respected people in all of Major League Baseball.
Apparently the Pirates’ fans know that, too, because
they showeda lot of class with the ovation.

Now that the stadium is officially done with.
baseball, let’s think about the set of “lasts7’ thatwill .

be associated with it.- 1

John Wehner, a player from the Jim
Leyland era J who returned to.
Pittsburgh this season. . ,
Last hit? ' Unfortunately for the
Pirates, Wehner didn’t get thelast hit.
He was up with two outs in the bottom

   
    
  
  
     

_ third, but he grounded out to end, the
' , ' game. The - honor actually goes to.
'MarlO John Vander Wal, whose single to
i right knocked in ‘Jason Kendall, to
.  bring the Pirates within a run.

E Last stupid play? Mike Benjamin,
who was caught leaning toward» second base in the
eighth inning and got doubled off after a line drive
to first baseman Mark Grace. - « ’

Last bad postgame performance? That would
have to go to the dancers who cameout for a show

. which celebrated-the 1970s, a decade in which the

‘Last home run? None other than...

of the ninth and runners on second and ,

duced to the crowd. Lamont, who by the time you Pirates won a pair of world championships; These

people were bad. They-could not sing or; dance,
which would seem essential to a performance like
the one they tried to give last night. '

Last upset win? Sauerkraut Saul is the winner

‘of this, for his come-from-behind victory in the

Pittsburgh Pierogi Race, whichftook place in the
middle of the fifth inning at every home game this
year.’ Saul didn’t win for the first three months of
the contest, and he was losingto Potato Petelast
night before bumping him out of ..the ways with
about 10 -yards to go in the race. -

Last jeers from the fans? Sid Bream, come on
down, because you’re therwinner of this one; Bream

played for the Pirates from. 1985-1990, but most

Pittsburgh fans will always remember him for beat-
ing Barry Bonds’ throw to -home plate’ in 1992, as
Bream’s run gave -the Atlanta Braves a‘ win in the

seventh and final game of the * National League .

Championship Series.,Bream was introduced last
night to a mix of boos and cheers from the-crowd.
I, for one, ‘was booing. I’ll never, forgive Bream,

Pirates pitcher Stan Belinda, who gave up the hit, or ‘

Francisco Cabrera, the batter who delivered the sin-
gle to left field. 7 ' '

WOMEN

Rutgers 3, Pitt 2

The Panthers fell into a quick 1-
0 hole against Rutgers when
Shannon Nagle took a cross pass
from senior Jenica Bridges and
cranked the ball in past Pitt goal-
keeper Rachel Brown 34 se_conds
into the game. ’

Pitt went down 2-0 five minutes
before the -half when Lissette
Brandao headed Tiphanie Forst’s
corner kick in. The Panthers had
fallen to a 3-0 deficit with 14 min-
utes left in the game when Keri
Lages found a pass from Bridges
and sent it toward the upper left cor-
ner of the net.

But the Rutgers defense soon

Registration from 8:“3oam-9am
Picnic following the event

broke down after Lages’ goal and
the Panthers rallied with two more
goals in the next six minutes. Cande
Ruiz scored at the 78-minute mark
on a Annette Agredano pass and
Agredano used her head at the 82-
minute mark to tap in ‘a Lauren
Sciocchetti midfield kick. .

Yet the Scarlet Knights held on
and gave Pitt its eighth loss of the
season. Pitt outshot Rutgers 'l8—9
while Brown had four saves and
Rutgers goalkeeper Christine
Caldwell had six.

“Give creditto Pitt, but the
biggest thing we need to ‘learn is
how to play with a lead,” Rutgers
head coach Glenn Crooks said. “We
really lack“ composure, we don’t
have somebody really taking charge
on the field to compose people when

things are going a little hectic. We

went up three-nil and we relaxed a

bit and they were all over us.”

Pitt‘3, Villanova 2 (2OT)

Dejected from their loss to
Rutgers, the Panthers had to beat or
tie Villanova to stay alive for post-
season play.

The game started out good for
Pitt when Agredano sent Leah
Greenspoon’s corner kick past
Villanova goalkeeper Janel Schillig
for a 1-0 score. .

But the Wildcats stormed back
and tied the game with five minutes
left in the half on Kristin Dunst’s
right-side blast to the bottom corner
of--the net.“ A

Pitt opened the second half on a
full offensive tilt and almost had a

 

 

2-1 advantage two minutes in when
Cande Ruiz popped one in. But the
goal was voided because of an off-
sides call.

Nova instead tookthe 2-1 lead
at the 63-minute mark when goal-
keeper“ Brown « and defender
Jacqueline Fix collided with each
other leaving Quinn Sellers with a
wide-open;net and enough time to
take the short pass from Janessa
Jeltema and score. .

Trailing, the Panthers again

turned up the offensive pressure and V

this time broke through the
Villanova defense. With three min-
utes left in regulation, Fix got an
Agredano pass and lobbed it over

the 6—foot-tall Schillig from 7 yards"

out for the tying score.
_ ‘.‘The ball was just bouncing

_ aroundand Ikizcked it in,” Fix said.

“It was a really weak goal.”

The’ first overtime went by fast
and_furious with_both teams’ offens-
es going at .full tilt and both defens-
es thwarting their attempts.

The second overtime became
gritty as both teams got more physi-
cal and fatigue started to set in. The
Wildcats had two prime scoring
chances that were stopped by the

. excellent play of Brown. Brown had -
eight saves while Schillig had three. '

Freshman Kimberly Sturk final-
ly had enough of the game ‘and
decided to take matters into her own
hands. With 37 seconds left, she
took an. Emily Tipton pass and sent
it to the right side of the net for her
first career goal-and the victory. - o

‘—‘I saw the. goalkeeper and the

ball coming in and I was just hoping V

to hit the far postand not complete-

s ly‘ miss it,” Sturk said. V

The Panthers and Wildcats tied‘
while the‘
_ Wildcats held a 10-6 advantage on

for 22 shots overall,

shots on goal. «

' - “It’s so frustrating because we

can beat so many teams,” Fix said.
"We should be winning so many‘

~ more games than we are, butl guess

it’s just going to take some more

time.” 1

The win on Sunday keeps Pitt
alive for a shot at a berth in the Big

East Tournament. The Panthers (4-T8’

overal1,_1-3 Big East) had to beat

Villanova and Big East_ Mid-‘

Atlantic Division opponents West

‘ __Virginia and Georgetown, or beat
two of them and tie the other, to.
7 - qualify for the quarter-final playoffs
' 2 at the end of October. ,

Pitt will play West Virginia on

Wednesday at 4 p.m. at the Morton V
- SportsComplex in Upper St. Clair

to continue its run to the postseason.
“It’ll be a war Wednesday,”
Sturk said. “We have a rivalry_with

"West Virginia and we’re both in the
same spot. They “only have one win ' r

so they can’t afford to ‘mess up
either.” ‘ A

Freeman said the team’s goals
weren’t accomplished, although
there isn’t much ground to be made
up to reach those goals.

“The top runners were within 58
seconds [of each other]. We want to
squeeze it down to 35 seconds,”
Freeman said.

Junior Beth Rocks wasn’t far
behind Schmidt, taking eighth with
a time of 18:58, and senior Sarah
McMillan was right behind her in
ninth at 19:00. I

“I didn’t have a strategy,”
Rocks said. “I wanted to go out, be
competitive and do the best I could.
We have to step up and work hard

for Pitt.”

Freshman Dawn Hilgert also
contributed to the Pitt cause, cross-
ing the line in 17th place with a
time of 19:29.

On the men’s «side, Division II
Malone Collegewon the men’s title
with 20 points, while Pitt ended up
in fourth place with 89 points.

Senior captain Mike Head was
the first to finish for the men, com-
ing in ninth place with time of
26:41 on the 5—mi1e course. i

“I was still a little bit sick,” said
Head, who had bronchitis last week.
“But that’s no excuse. I should’ve
run better.” ‘ .

Head’s strategy was to stay up
with the leaders from start to finish,

but it didn’t.work out the way he _,

‘had planned.‘ I . -

Senior Justin Wiley took 11th
place at 26:50. Freshman Mike
Diano came in at 27:00, good for
14th place.

‘The men’s team under—per—
formed,” Freeman said. “It was
probably not one of their best per-

” formances of the year.”

In two weeks, the Panthers trav-

._el to the University of Michigan’s
, campus’

for the
Invitational.
They are looking forward to
challenging some of the nation’s
top teams, including the University
of Washington, while getting some
more respect, exposure and maybe
even redemptioniin the process.

that the men have to rebound quick-
ly from their underachieving per-
formance on Saturday. .

' “We want to bring ourselves up

in the Big East and gain some

respect,” said Rocks, who hopes to
help the Pitt women get out of the
Big East basement it has been in for
the ‘past few years. _ I

“Pitt cross country hasn’t been
anything anybody’s recognized,”
she said. “We want to compete with
the best, of them.”
