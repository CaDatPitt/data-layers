fund scholarship

'8 by» VINCE DiNARDO

Wendy King, has decided to set up a one time scholarship program

for Pitt radio students in honor of her late husband, Ed.

For 18’ years Ed and Wendy King were the hosts of a late night

talk show in Pittsburgh. Party Line, which was telecast nightly on
KDKA was the most popular talk show ever to grace Pittsburgh radio. .

The Kings always greeted calling guests with warm and courte-

have as well as giving a nightly
quiz, The Party Pretzel, which was
rewarded with a prize.

When her husband died, Wendy
asked those interested in sending
flowers to send money instead to be
used for
the scholarship. I ,

After her request was met with
response of nearly $500, King
located Peter Longini of the
University's speech

department. Longini, supervisor of ‘

WPGH is setting the scholarship

“-13- - 1- '

The award will be given on June
3rd at a banquet of The American
Federation of Radio and Television

Art ists. —The broadcasters’ union.
-, Longini is presently working to

find the needy collegiate broad-

“ casters who could use financial

aid.

Wendy chose the University of
Pittsburgh because of the
interest in her
husband's work.

Ed, who did research at Pitt

for his numerous docmnentaries
was greeted with repeated in-
terest. This is Wendy’s
way of ‘showing her gratitude.
. Longini has notified the WPGH
staff of the scholarship opportunity
and is in the process of choosing
the neediest

applicant.

“We’re banding together

-because we’re scared,” said "a

spectator at the rally that had been
planned as a Kent
State-Jackson State memorial by
the Special Programs Office. “We
don’t know what’s going to happen
tomorrow.” -

The rally was held at noon,
Wednesday, two days after the
President's announcement of the
blockade of North
Vietnamese ports.

A hundred to a hundred-fifty
people gathered on the _ Bigelow
Blvd. side of the Cathedral of
Learning to listen
to (among other speakers) the
student body president of Jackson
State and Arthur Krause, father of
Allison Krause,
who died at Kent State.

Jim Bay, a Pitt chaplain, who
works out of the University and
City Ministeries, was the
moderator. He introduced Ken
Hamilton, the student body
president of Jackson State, who
spoke about racism as an integral
part of American development,
and so of the Indochina war. He

1 said that the roots of the Indochina

war are not just our problem, but a
world-wide ' .

problem, and that we must not just
protest the war in Cambodia “(as

, was done in May of 1970) but the

war in Mississippi,
as well. “What’s happening in
Mississippi is now becoming a
national problem and you are
beginning to see it.”

Then a group called Black street
sang.

“Flowers and Bullets,” which was
written . about . Allison
Krause, and then her father, Ar-
thur Krause, came forward. He
read a «statement about the
declinement of justice in
America, which said in part,
“While the purpose of law is to
prevent the strong from always
having their___o_wn way,
we have, in the last few years,
passively submitted to the
monarchial authority of the courts,
urgemt‘ our government
toward the law of force.”

A representative of SDS and the
Progressive Labor Party, Kathy
Lindsley spoke of getting out of
South Vietnam
altogether and removing ROTC
from Pitt. On a longer range, she
spoke of “kicking out the rich
people that rule
us forever, and setting up a state of
workers.” She called for an end to
the blockade, an end to the racist
bombing I

\and for unity to kiokROTC off

Jay Silverman, brother-in-law of
Sandra Shure, who died at Kent
State did a reading from Daniel
Berrigan’s
Trial of the Catonsville Nine.

Joseph Rhodes, a member of the
Scranton Commission, who in-
vestigated Kent State, and a
candidate for the
Legislature from Homewood, in
speaking, said that in the last few
years he had noticed a progression
of a . loss _ of our
spirit of outrage. “In the last two

He requested that Governor

make provisions for what might
happen in the next two weeks.

“Our President,” he said in

Student Body President

FAS approves Graduate Appeals Board

by JAMIE KIRKWOOD
News Editor
The Faculty of Arts and Sciences
Council approved the creation of a
Graduate Appeals Board at
Monday's meet-

The board will “serve in
judgement of charges of arbitrary
or unfair treatment of FAS
graduate students by members
of the faculty of FAS.”

According to the FAS Gazette,
Vol. 3 No. 15, the Board will at-
tempt to “arbitrate disagreements
between students
and faculty in matters such as:
grades, honesty, graduate student
progress, comprehensive and
preliminary examinations,
theses and dissertations, em-
ployment, rights of graduate
students, and dismissal.”

Cases presented to the board
shall be limited to those considered
at the departmental level but not
resolved.

The Graduate Appeals Board
was proposed by the Graduate
Council on the grounds that
graduate - appeals differ
greatly from undergraduate ap-
peals and can not be handled by the
Academic Integrity Board. ,

Charges of Academic Integrity

V occur “rarely” on the graduate I

level according to Associate Dean

. of "FAS \and ’ Director‘

-l/r

“afraid of a proliferation of review

  

of Graduate Programs Dr.
Richard McCoy. McCoy cited only
two or three cases of graduate
integrity coming before him
in a span of approximately five
years.

A number of graduate problems
were seen as legitimate enough to
require anew board. P ‘

Copyright and patent conﬂicts
may occur when a graduate
student is working closely with a
professor. There are
sometimes discrepancies over the
crediting of research.

Dr. McCoy also listed the
awarding of Teaching Assistant-
ships as a “subject of considerable
anxiety.”

“Sometimes we need something
to adjudicate bad dealings in
awarding of assistantships.”

Most undergraduate‘ cases were
found to be charges of plagiarism
leveled by the professor or
students alleging

‘unfairtreatment affecting grades.
It was acknowledged that these
claims may be handled through the
Academic -
Integrity Board.

A major problem that warrants
considerable thought is the
establishment of one more review
board. ,

Dr. McCoy summarized, “How

Clrrssicrtl pirmist trieshruul at flmky jazz

by DIANE HOLLINGSWORTH

The Pitt Jazz Band was turning
up. One trumpeter’s A was ﬂat;
Dr. Nathan Davis, the director,
stopped to correct it.

Feeling faintly foolish and very
nervous, I went up to the piano and

‘introduced myself to the pianist,
Jesse Cramer".
“Dr. Davis promised I could play a
number at rehearsal today,” I
said.

He smiled and showed me the
music.-; definitely not the four-
beats-to-a-measure-and-quarter
note-gets-one-count stuff
I was used to; just letters for the
chords. "

The instrumentalistldoes his own
arranging.

“Uh, I’m not exactly" ex-
perienced at this,” I explained.
“May I sit through a few?”

The first number looked difficult,
but the band really clicked. It had a
deep, down-to-earth quality, a
“heavy”
sound—as Davis -put -it,
gritty dirty band.”

. .I thought about how the band had
grown since 1969, when it consisted
of seven pieces. Davis had written
all .

the music then. Now it is up to 22
instruments, with 11 singers and
five dancers, and a group that
ranges from
freshmen to doctoral candidates
witha wide variety of majors.
The Jazz Band is a volunteer
activity; music majors receive
one-half credit. “For all the work
they do,” Davis insists,
“they should all get a three-credit

“a nitty.

. A.”

But they play, I suppose, from a
sheer love of music. I was sure of
that as I watched Jesse’s expert
hands_ spending
handfuls of chords up to heaven. I

‘wondered if I could ever be that

good, even if I played jazz for ten
years, ,
as he has.

The dancers came out for the
next number. That nights program
was really .a dance concert, with
the band accompanying
a few numbers. The band has
played for all types of groups
around Pittsburgh, high schools,
hotels, a benefit
for the students; even, last year, a
half-hour special for television.
They’ll be at Three Rivers Arts
Festival May
28th, and they’re cutting their
second record—at Davis’ expense.

Funds are a problem. University
rules prohibit charging admission,
and they receive no funds, either
from the music
department of Student Allocations.
“That’s what gripes me,” said
Davis. “We’ve turned down so
many opportunities
because we don’t have the money.”

But they don’t go to com-
petitions. “Don’t believe in them,”
asserts their director. “Art is not
competitive. Everybody
should go, shoot his best shot, enjoy
it, and go home.” ,

Watching Jessie’s rhythmic love

‘ affair with “The Emancipation

Blues,” Itried to remember what
Dr. Davis had said about
improvisation, the stock-in-trade
of jazz pianists. Itwas more or-
namentation, he insisted; a more
interesting way of

getting there from here.

“We need a way,” he had said,
“to judge the quality of jazz. A few
friends and I are working on it. It
just I

can’t be done. from the standpoint
of West European music.”

He is critical of the so-called
“free musicians.” “Music,” he
stated, “is the soul of Nature and
Nature has more rules
than anything else I know. Anyone
who settles for less is only paying
lip service to music.”

Davis signalled to me.
don’t you try this one?”

My heart jumped, then settled
somewhere in the vicinity of my
feet. My hands felt like ice. Come
on, I told myself,
George Plimpton never panics.

The “Divide and Conquer”
strategy that knocked Edmund
Muskie out of the primary contests
by late April was beginning
to have its effect on the Humphrey
campaign -in the Indiana and Ohio
primaries‘ of early May. '

Humphrey found himself bat-
tling the McGovern left flank in
Ohio and the Wallace right in In-
diana, with only a six
percent lead over Wallace and a
hopeless election muddle in Ohio to
show for his efforts. ‘

Director of Housing, had -several
comments on the motives and
extents of the Riots. -

' Vrana refers to the riots as th
Spring Rites. He explains that for
the several years that he has been
at Pitt, _
the’Rites have been held annually.
So they couldn’t very well be
confused with anything as spon-
taneous
as a riot.

Vrana has a theory_as to the
cause of the rites. He believes that
when “the grass starts to bloom
and the trees
start to blossom, there is more
oxygen in the air. This (sudden
burst ~ of extra oxygen hits the
students and causes ‘
them to have more energy to work

off. In effect they are high on-

during the Rites was due to water
and fire damage. There is no way
of predicting _
the cost of the damage_. It will run
over a couple thousand dollars,
Vrana said. The most costly item is
the Condensor
unit that serves the health center.

- Vrana also explained a plan that
will be in effect this summer in
order to get the towers into good
shape by next

fall. In the past the repair effort .

was concentrated on the Quad
buildings, but this.year the effort
will be on

the Towers. During the. Spring
Session‘, Tower A will be closed to
permit massive repairs. During
the Summer Session,
Tower B and C will be closed for
the same purpose.

In reference to damage, Vrana
pointed out that the Husing Staff
and the students have three
responsibilities,

“One, the Housing staff, has a
responsibility to keep the housing
in‘ good order. Two, the students

when one considers that his staff
decided to enter Ohio in full force
only ' I » '

“after his Wisconsin victory.

But unlike the early primary
battles that he imdertook with his
army of volimteers, more green is
now flowing into
the grass roots effort.

McGovern also won a minor
victory of sorts in Indiana,_ a
primary statethat he declined to
enter. Showing_ themselves
to the masters ‘of the reformed
delegate selection rules that the
McGovern commission had
developed, Indiana McGovemites

packed the meetings at which

to keep the housing in good order.
And three, the Staff has a
responsibility to make a fair and

ment and liability system?’

He squarely put the blame for ,

the bad conditions that exist in the
Towers, on the shoulders of the
students.

“Most of the damage is a result of
the students, and therefore our

cleaning up and repair is due to ‘

that.” .

At the same time he praised the
housing staff commenting that,
“Our work force are on the ﬂoors
every day. These
are very dedicated people; some
have been working for 25 years.
They take pride in their work and
try to do a '

Regarding the trouble with the

I through a friend, Mark Heckinan.

190 pounds spread over a 6’2”
frame. His dark brown hair
lengths every

them, settling realistically on one

analogy.

“You'll like it,” he said, knowing
a victim when he saw one.‘

The lecture was in the » Pitt
Student Union dining mom and
about 350 people attended. I was so
skeptical as to

be nearly deaf. I had seen holy a

roller tent shows in the South and"
West and claims of instant cures
a n d p a nacreas,
awoke in me a New
England Yankee suspicion and
cynicism. .
The meeting was conducted by
Steve and John Allon of Pittsburgh.

Both are full time teachers for

S I M S , S t u -
dents International Meditation
Society, a national non-profit
organization. They head the Pitt-
s b u r g h b r a n c h
office.

“Transcendental Mediation,”
they said, “has been reintroduced
at this time by Maharishi Mehesh

Yogi, and is a re-
vival of a technique that is at least
5,000 years old. ‘

“It requires no special diet, no
regimen of exercise. In fact, it

requires no effort at all. It is not ’

based on reli-
gious ‘mysticism, nor does it
contradict religious beliefs. It does
require that you set aside two
t w e n t y
periods each day when you can
meditate.” -

They went on to explain how TM
works by using an analogy.

“A thought starts as a faint ’

impulse deep in the mind and rises
until it is recognized as a thought,
much like » a *
bubble begins at the bottom of the
ocean and rises to the surface.
“As bubble and thouht rise, they
expand and develop until both
burst on the surface.” ~

' They used a chart to depict the

process: (A) represents the 10-15

percent of available mental‘

capacity utiliz
ed by most men. a

“In TM, the -meditator turns
inward and learns to appreciate
the thought at increasingly more
and more refined
stages of development. Man learns
to utilize the unused portion of the
mind (b) until,‘ eventually, he
cognizes the
source of thought, pure con-
sciousness (c).

“We know from psychological
and physiological data that the
source if thought is a som'ce of
tremendous energy‘,
intelligence, and happiness. This

explains why no effort, control or‘

concentration is used. in TM: the

mind

naturally gravitates towardsareas

of greater serenity andpeace.”
‘Fair-enough; I thought. ‘Bring

on the fancy claims.’ But there

were‘ no claims. There were, in-

stead, facts. k

Experiments had been conducted

at Harvard, Yale, UCLA, Stanford,

and London Hospital and the
publish.e;,d

  

minute‘

in magazines like Scientific
American, American Journal of
physiology, Psychology Today,
and the New England
Joiu'nal of Medicine.

The experiments measured
metabolic rate, or the body’s use of
energy, heart rate, electrical skin
resistance (which
indicates emotional tension) and
alpha wave patterns of the brain.

Dr. Herbert Benson, a car-
diologist at Harvard Medical
School, became interested in TM’s
effect on hypertension, or

‘high blood pressure and anxiety
levels. He found that the body
prepares for ‘ﬂight or fight’ by
increasing oxy
gen consumption, ‘heart rate and
blood pressure, and the secretion
of blood lactate, a substance linked
with .

causing feelings of anxiety.

Dr. Robert Wallace, a
physiologist at UCLA, also became
interested in the restful effects of

during TM.

Brain wave patterns of subjects
in TM indicated that the mind was
at rest and yet remained alert.
A l p h a r h y t h in s
increased’ in regularity and am-
plitude indicating a complete state
of relaxation had been achieved
(Chart 3),- but
response to stimuli like’ noise
proved that the mind was still
alert.

Meditation was found to be more
relaxing than ‘either sleep or
hypnosis. 'Ihe accumulative ef-
fects of meditation
were also greater.

“You know,” said Spencer, “I’m
beginning to dry out. It’s taken
awhile.”

He was referring to stopping his
fifth-a-day bourbon habit since
starting TM. His reasons for
drinking read like a
litany of middleclass ills: sickly
wife, kids raising hell in school,

was Spencer’s real ‘cure’.

. “I didn’t drink a fifth every day, l

just those days that seemed the

worst, like they were closing in on

me.

That was most days, I guess.”
But he has, stopped drinking,

after meditating only three weeks.

. “I don’t feel that I need the booze.

anymore.’_’ .,

_In a seperate study concerning
drug and alcohol addiction
published hi Hearings before the
U.S. House of Rep
resentatives Select Committee on
Crime, Drs. Benson and Wallace

found that meditators decreased ‘

their . use of

by JANE HENDERSON

Students in the Department of
Physical Therapy have organized
in an effort to coordinate activities
a m o n g m e m b e r s
and to promote communication
with the faculty. The name of the
organization is the University of
Pittsburgh Student
Physical Therapy Association
(UPSPTA).

The need for such‘ an
organization was felt this year
when the curriculum in this

‘professional major changed from

‘a one year program to one that
covers five consecutive terms in
the School’ of Health ‘Related
Professions.

Besides the functions of tmiting

the students and creating better.

relationships with the instructors,
UPSPTA ’ V

will try to give the students a better
idea of the different aspects of the

profession. Professional therapists

from the Pittsburgh area will be
invited to discuss a variety of
topics.

]Vurses back chemistry professor for tenltre

Once again a departmental ten-
ure decision has enraged under-
graduate students, this time in
the School of Nursing. Ph.D. To-,
bias Chapman, assistant profes-
sor, was not recommended_ for
tenure recently by the associate
and ull professors of the Chem-

- istry Department.

istry to nursing students. Mem-

maintains the student body will
unanimously support Chapman.’

“Chapman completely revised
the Chemistry 92 curriculum.
brought in extra materials, pro-
duced his own lab manual and
gave up his own free time to pro-
vide review sessions to help us."
Kenny said. “Even the students

’ who failed the course liked him.
because’ his grading policy was g_

fair_."

= =EnHotline answers college questions

An analysis of questions may
be forthcoming from the project
to aid counselors.

Pitt s-till operates on an option-
al interview for admissions.

"It‘s physically impossible to
do 6,000 interviews," Meisner

commented, “Although we have,

three counselors interviewing ev-
ery day.”

The Hotline could cut down on
needless questions and yield a
more enlightened interview.

Some nursing students have
threatened to picket if Chapman
is not given tenure by the Univer-
sity.

Chapman feelsthat he was giv-'
en a fair hearing by the depart-
ment. but maintains he was re-
fused tenure because he had not
published many papers.

Chapman agrees with the de-
partment that research is an im-
portant part of .a professors obli-
gationsf "A good researcher does
not always have to be a poor
teacher, many instructors man-
age to do both well," Chapman
said.

“I feel that it is important to
perform research to maintain
your excitment and interest in
your field so that you will be a
competent and interesting teach-
er,” he added.

Chapman’s~. research concerns
the synthesis of various impor-
tant biochemical compounds and
the study of their behavior during
various reactions. He has pub-
lished papers in Synthesis and the
Biochemical and Biophysics Re-
search Communication. .

But Chapman feels that a pro-
fessor’s research should not in-
terfere with his teaching. "Organ-

ic Chemistry is tremendously rel- -

evant to the biological sciences
and the health related professions
and I tried to make it an exciting
course,” Chapman remarked.

Chapman was pessimistic con-
cerning the outcome of the depart-
mental vote long before the meet-
ing. He noted that the Chemistry
Department is in a very strong
position at this time; with their
new building, recent National Sci-
ence Foundation Excellence
Award and the large grants which
they have recently received. '

“The department is in a good
position to hire a super-research-
er,” Chapman said, “someone
who has a reputation for grinding
out papers.” He believes that
members of the department felt
that by ousting him, they would
have space to accommodate such
a scientist. He remarked that the
present job market has left a lot
of qualified chemists out of work.

“I feel that the values used by
the department in making tenure
decisions are wrong,” he remark-
ed, “but they followed all the cor-
rect procedures so I will not take
my case before a grievance com-
mittee.”

"Women are women when they
come into the University," said
Ellen Ganley, president of Asso-
ciated Women Students. “They
don't need a month of college to
make them women.” ' I

Speaking of Lantern Night. one
of those way-back-when Pitt tra-
dition which formally and cere-
moniously transforms frosh co-
eds into.women, Ganley express-
ed he.r desire to have it discon-
tinued. In place of Lantern Night.

-Ganley would like to_program

speakers who would enlighten the .

freshman women on the alterna-
tives to post-graduate marriage
or office work. »

Programming of this kind is
nothing new to AWS. AWS has
sponsored such speakers as Bern-
adette Devlin, member of British
Parliament from Northern Ire-
land, and plans to have Gloria
Steinum, editor of.Ms. magazine;
Dalores Pittman, women’s rights
lecturer, and Robert Rimmer,
author of The Harrod Experi-
ment. Proposition 31 and The Har-
rod Letters. Dates are open for
undecided speakers and the week-
long Women’s Cultural Festival to
be held in the middle of the year.

, The major problem faced by
AWS is the acceptance by many
women of a male dominated so-.
ciety.

Ganley frownes on -lanternl nite

Ganley cited primary and sec-
ondary schools as a major con-
tributor to sexism in that children
learn there the respective male,
female roles they will assume in

later life.

Once so conditioned, it is diffi-
cult for women to think of them-
selves as equal to men. After
gaining confidence in their abil-
ities, college can begin to offer’
more to women than a degree in
English, according to Ganley.

She went on to state that it has
long been a fact that women with
college degrees earn only as much
as men with high school degrees.

Chinese

TOKYO ‘l AP) — China has step-
ped up the study of foreign lan-
guages, particularly English. as
it turns its face more toward the
outside world.

Chinese publications say the
learning process reaches down
to primary schools where children
of seven andgeight are struggling
with the intricacies of the.English
language.

In one commune primary school
school in Shanghai, pupils have in

‘ nine months mastered the pro-

nunciation of more than 60 com-
monly used words and learned to
sing 10 songs, among them “The
East Is Red” and ‘.‘The Interna-
tionale.”

The school had to overcome ob-
jections before beginning the
course last May. One was that
since some of the youngsters
were changing teeth, they could
not easily pronounce English syl-
ables.

The school decided that Chinese
children could do it if foreign

‘ children could.

Emphasis in the first year was
on listening and speaking without
learning the alphabet or spellih-.
These studies were paralleled by
classes in Chinese romanization.

.Written English came later, to

avoid confusion.

' Some teachers hang a map of
the world on the wall and explain

‘' the international situation while

teaching students to say in Eng-

lish, “People of the world unite to ~

  n....,.9a.;ine

   learn English

(Continued f,rom4PAage 6)

“The department chairman told ;

me that my colle .-igues recognized
by superior teachingability but
were disenchanted with my re-
sdarch,” Chapman said. He ad-

mitted ‘that he has had trouble 1,

in getting long term grants‘ re-
céntly, but added that he was re:

cently commended by the federal ‘
who approved a , ‘
grant. “Unfortunately they ran I
out of money and were unable to-

government,

fund me,” bemused.

Chapman claims that he is an
active member of the American

Chemical Society and that he has .

performed various services for
his department. He agrees with

many undergraduates who feel’

that tenure decisions should be
based on teaching ability as well
as research.

Chapman admits that he is flat- -
tered by the concern and activism —

of his former students in his be-
half, but is not optimistic regard-
ing the final decision regarding
his tenure. '

The Pitt mitters shook off their
hitting problems long enough to
capture the first game of an away
doubleheader
with the Temple Owls on Monday,
winning byithe score of 7-4.

Their hitting, or lack of it, came
back to haunt the Panthers in the
second contest which they drop-
ped, 4-2.

“We were finally getting the hits
at the right time,” stated Pitt
coach Bob Lewis. “Ken Macha
went ; three for C ’ four
in that game and Joe Groetch went
three for three,” accounting for
seven of the Cats 11 hits in the
opener. ’

Panther trackmen. ' -. . _ " 0
John Woodriff (‘39), who was an ' -

Olympic Gold Medalist 880 winner
in 1936, Everett Utterback,- the
national broad
jump champion in 1930, Frank Ohl,
a top performer in the 220, 440, and
the broadjump in 1938, and Carl
Olson, a

head coach from 1933 to 1958, will
receive the honors.

The meet will begin at 9:30 a.m.,
with the finals commencing at 2
p.m. The four greats. will be
honored prior to the
finals, after a lunch in their honor.

Hopefully, fine weather and a
fine turnout will accompany the/‘
ﬁne athletic contingent. Those
wishing to attend .
the meet should enter at Gate 10.
Admission will be $1.00 for adults
and $.50 for those under 18.

One will need a program -just to
tell the schools apart, not to‘
mention approximately 350
athletes. _

Last year Pitt took seven firsts in
the meet and many of the this
year’s top talent will be supplied by
Pitt itself.

Gary Risch will attempt to
defent both his 100 yard dash and
his 220 titles, Mike Schurko will try
to repeat in the
Steeplechase, and Steve Hein will
attempt a repeat in the discus.

Richmond, William and Mary,
Ohio State, and numerous State
Teacher’s Colleges will visit Pitt
for the first time tomorrow.
Returning from last year are
Cleveland State, Cincinnati, Ohio
University, WVU, and Slippery

concerned. all found reasons to
resi n as eastern athletic prestige
dechned.

So last week? Casimi-r Myslin-
mi of Pitt met with the other
three athletic -heads to decide the
fate of the Big Four.

Speculation involved around the
four campuses predicted that

‘these top men would either en-

tirely disband the group, or at
least loosen the strict. restric-
tions placed on them.

The stickiest rules, so far as
the athletic departments saw it,
were those limiting scholarships
and the ones concerned with red-
shirting.

The schools agreed to set a
limit of’ 100 scholarships every
four years -for football, ahp 20 ev-
ery four years for basketball. °

This ' particular rule haunted
Carl DePasqua his first year as
head coach here, when he! discov-
ered Dave Hart left him a mere 18
football scholarships to play with
The usual mﬁor colleges give out

But the speculation predicting
that the Big Four was about to be-
come a thing of the past was foil-
ed. It was-put to an end by the four
AD’s. who. to everyone surprise
but their own, absolved the Big 4
for their teams’ showings by vot-
ing unanimously to uphold their
standards in their entirity.

by VINCE Di NARDO
Sports Editor

A lot of high school basketball
fans are of the feeling that Keith
Starr. a highly touted basketball
athlete from Quaker Valley High
School, was aptly named.

At 65". Starr is considered one
of the finest guards in Pennsyl-
vania and before he signed with
Pitt was considered ‘a top pros-
pective recruit.

A look at the statistics quickly
reveals why.

As a senior at Quaker Valley,
Starr scored 550 points. Broken
down, that averaged 25 a game,
including a school high of 39 in
one game. He also tallied 225 as-
sists (nine per game) as well as
captaining histeam to the WPIAL
(Western Pennsylvania Inter-
scholastic Athletic League) Class
Bplayoffs.

on tougher competition this year
with their new spring schedule.

Coach “Goldie“ Edwards cited
some problems encountered dur-
ing the season. "We missed two of
our players on r most of the
matches and thereforethe playing
positions were altered. I

Elaine Kingus played the nu-n-
bér one position at Kent and .-\.<h-
land and played very well. Also.
Cathy Cassell. one of our doubles
players. is developing her tennis
especially well.“

In retrospect. Edwards con-
cluded that “under the circu.r'm
stances." the girls played as well I
as they could have. The schools
that beat us won because they
were better. especially Lock Hav-
en and Ohio University. Ifeel that
the season was, well worth play-
ing all the games. Last‘ season.
with our fall schedule. was a

waste of time.“

For his efforts, Keith was
named to the Associated Press
first—team All—State, to the first
team United Press international
Class B All—State. as a member
of the Pennsylvania squad in the
recent Roundball Classic. the
Most Valuable Player in the
WPIAL Class B. All—WPIAL. All-
Section (16-B). and Most Valuable
Player in the recent Quigley
Classic.

While busy attaining these hon-
ors. Starr still found time to grad-
uate in the top fifth of his grad-
uating class.

 

TOP—Dorel Watleyn who tied the
record for the stadium quarter mile,
crosses the finish line in Pitt's mile
relay victory, at the Big Four Sat-
urday.

LEFT—Rich Jackson hands baton to

Rick Weaver on first leg of mile re- A

lay team. At this point in the race
Pitt was ahead. In fact, Pitt never
trailed in the mile relay and de-
feated Penn State by a full .‘two
seconds.

Panthers wishupon shooting Starr

With all these honors behind
him, Starr confidently looks for-
ward to new horizons in college.
He admists that he will have to
learn to play a different type de-
fense in college, as well as look-
ing at his height differently.

“I'm not going to the tallest
man on the floor anymore." he
said. “I’ll have to learn to use my
height as a guard. I won’t be un-
der the boards as much and I think
I'll have to learn a few more
moves.

“In high school I’d watch a guy
underneath.” he continued._ now

Big 4 ta ac

 

I’ll be up front, where the guys are

a lot swifter. I'll have to work on '

my defense a little bit."

Before signing, Starr had nar-
rowed his choice to North Caro-
lina and Skyscraper U. But, the
“people” and the Pitt education
won out. With the signing of__
Starr and Tom Richards, an ear-
lier signee, Pitt shouldn’t have
many problems at guard for at
least four years.

And while most incoming ath-V
letes will’ be trying to build a
name to live up to, Keith will be

‘trying to live up to his name,

Starr.
