SFA 1s on the move!

In a close Vote, 19 to 18, Gus—Wilde, Fraternity candidate,
was elected president of the Assembly, breaking the 1§—16 tie

of the last SFA meeting.

The faculty vote undoubtedly decided _the election. ‘

Betty Toohill, independent candidate, won the post of

secretary to the Assembly by one
_vote “also. ,
The election voting was appar-
ently straight party voting.
However, voting following the
election was not straight party,
and showed evidence that hence-
forth issues would be decided on
their merit and not on their politi-
cal sponsorship.
Two resélutions, one setting up

a Student Welfare Program, and V

one declaring the recent appoint-
ments by the_ old and new execu-
tive committees unconstitutional,
were passed without straight party
voting.

Al Icardi, Independent, brought
up the question of whether, accord-
ing to the constitution of SFA, the
appointments of next semester's
SFA committee chairmen had been
legal. He pointed out that the con-
stitution did not state that the old
executive committee was to help‘ the
new executive committee pick com-
mittee chairmen, a fact which had
only recently been accomplished,
last, year’s Fraternity dominated
executive committee having been
the deciding factor in giving Fra-
ternity men six chairmanships and
allowing Independents only three
in the coming Assembly.

After some discussion Icardi’s

—minority report, recommending that
all committee appointments be de-
clared unconstitutional, was accept-
ed by a split party vote. I

equipped with an official air-raid
instruction poster before the end
of the week. ' « o

The posters will be individualized

They are intended as the pri-

to make other preliminary instruc-

_ We have just emerged from the re<»:iesses-o:f professor Jones’ course
in the history of the English language. Such a course is not to be taken
with impunity. More appropriate would be a chaser of heavily-spiked gin. _
Take, for instance, the word “comedian.” First, split the word.
.This gives you “co" and “median.” Not very impressive, unless you
 know the history of the word. In theiyear 474-B.C., an itinerant minstrel
‘show, the Acropolis Three, left Syracuse (soon to be referred to as
ill‘-io_chester), to present a performance at Maximus Gentius’ Bijou, a
a Roman amphitheater sponsored jointly by the city’s gods, Zeus and
Minsky. In the minstrel show were two end men and one funster who
‘stood between them. Thus the word “co-median,” meaning “comedian.”

Take another word. Don’t tell me. Now put it back and shuffle the
deck three times, then--well that's another game.

 Take the word “individual.” This dates back to an early picnic at
/“Yale, at that time known as Yale. The jargon of thosestimes substituted
the word “vidual” (from the Celtic‘ “vittle”)~ for food. Chief topic of
*-’-conversation on the campus was the research of Yale professor Higgins
‘{;for a rare, long-tailed insect known scientiﬁcally as hyperkeisterus. On
it picnic in the summer of ’03, Professor Higgus spied the insect in a
jlunch basket, whereupon the assemblage cried in clear, erudite tones:
J "“It’s in da vidual.” — v

C Often the etymologist runs up against conflicting theories of de-
rivation. The word “epistle," for instance, is explained by two conflict-
ing hypotheses, the Delancey street and the Salami Mutation. The De-
lancey street versionhas it that a Brooklyn mailman, accustomed to;
. reading his clientele’s letters, opened one addressed to a certain shady
, lady inla second-story Hester street flat, and began to read therefrom.
V “Hallway through page two, he threw his mailbag into the air and shot

down the street, screaming, “Wow, ain’t that a pistol!” The expression
was later contracted to read, “Wow, what epistle!) and later, under
the revised acceleration program, “Wow 1”

lication.

  

  

  

  

 
 

J; S The more popular Salami Mutation theory deltes into an early scene
, in Tel Aviv. J. Patrick Ginsberg was in the custom of receiving mail
it from a friend in Berlin. Each day Ginsberg would open his letter, and
g each day his wife would ask him, “Vus is dus epess, tell me.” Translat-
 “What is this something, zug min”) “Epess” became epis, “tell” he-

came tle, and the two together became epistle. At least epistle.

The ﬁeld. of. language is studded withother derivations, each as fas-
7’. cinating as the rest combined. The word ﬁnancier is merely a variant
7 form of the Teutonic “ﬁnif” (ﬁve). The expression “Quisling’7 comes
from a bright Scandina.vian boy who knew all the answers (to such ques-
tions as “Who are you for?” and “What side is your ersatz buttered
it on? ”), and thereby received thetitle of Quisling, the Norwegian variant
, ‘Yet £Quizkid. In the same nationality group,’ “Smorgasbord” was born
pvhen a hungry man with his mouth full asked a waiter named Gaspar
., for a second helping. M L _.
S ' "The ﬁeld of etymology offers unlimited opportunities to people of
’-‘Ill classes‘. “Classes,” on the one hand, derives from the popular abbre-
jviation for Cathedral of Learning, and, on the other, to the expression
referring to a certain group of students known asmanyway, it’s an is-

Then came December 7.

And night-watchmen Heini_e Mellon and
Clugston and Tommy Johnston stood around our
copy desk all night while Ed Biegel drew war
maps for them. And when students came to class
thenext morning there was the Pitt News war
extra waiting for-them. I

And then the University‘started to accelerate.
Bowman and Fitzgerald and Shockley and Biddle,
and Rush and Crawford and Lanfear——these were
the names that made news, as the University .
adopted the tri-mester plan. _ .

We like to look beck on the Red.-Cross drive.

their little glass banks, hundreds of them, ﬁlled

There was the battle ship drive. We remember
the night Herby Gall presented the idea to SFA
and Stauff and Charlotte Harris said a few things

  ere

box the day Eddie Jones and Ralph Fife whipped
Fordham, while Bob Machesney and Bob Graham
and Doc Carlson and Mrs. Bowser combined to let
out the loudest “whooooooop” we’ve ever heard.
And then there was the time the downtown pas '
pers whipped up a scare—story about Chancellor
Bowman resigning. He didn’t, though, and the
News was credited withhaving the only true ac-
count of the incident that appeared in any city pub-

about it, and SFA let it ‘go at that. And -"then we
remember how Gall, got a crew together——Dick
Hartz and Ruth Becker and Irv Glass and how
they made the idea work. ‘

But it couldn’t have worked without the help of c
the women’s fraternities, the Tri-Delts and the
ZTA’s and the AEPhi’s and Thetas and the Kap-
pas and the Chi ()’s_ and all the rest.

For the second time in three.

years Katherine Hepburn returns
from Hollywood to do a new play
by Phillip Barry and presented by
the Theatre Guild.

When “Without Love” opens a
'week’s engagement at the Nixon
theatre on Monday evening, May
11, Miss Hepburn and Elliott Nu-

~gent will appear in the leading

roles.

In 1939, having completed a
ﬁlm version of Barry’: “Holiday,”
Miss Hepburn left Hollywood to
return to Broadway in a new Barry‘
comedy called “The Philadelphia
Story,” which was to prove the
greatest success either Barry or
Miss Hepburn had ever had up to
that time.

Now the same combination of

Hepburn-Bari-yy-Theatre Guild are

presenting “Without Love” for its
showing in Pittsburgh and for its
Broadway premiere in the Fall.
Miss Hepburn has once more re-
turned from the Coast and from
the ﬁlming of the successful “Phila-
delphia Story” and “Woman of the
Year” to play the role of Jamie
Coe Rowan, heroine of “Without.
Love.” . , ‘

«of March 4 . . . the honoraries

tapped . . . but everyone "had a good
time that day because there was the
Float Parade. A the Sweep stakes,
and the Spring Swing.

April 20: With heads held high,
and knees shaking the new cadet
ofﬁcers marched to the front of
their ranks that afternoon . . .
some of us were too weak to watch
the ceremony because the Blood
Bank Unit was on campus.

April 22: Just when we thought
all the battles were won, there
came. the SFA elections and things
started popping all over again . . .
a well written story in the News
informed us that it was the week
originally set aside for Cap and
Gown and we could not help but
curse the Japs.

April 24: Pitt News was given
over to senior news. for the next
day was Coronation, and Sunday
was commencement. '

April 29: SFA was still in dead-
lock . . . but the band played on . . .
the News started its anti-discrim-
ination campaign.

May 4: Seriousness of December
7th brought back today when Dr.
Geise announced air raid plans
. . . a committee was set. up to study
race policy . . . and the entire school
was proud of _the AEPhi’s record
breaking stamp sale.

And so we close the ﬁle on an ex-
citing year and leave the News
Office until June 7th.

There will be_ no Panther -this
summer, but in September the cam-
pus magazine will have several new
policies, says Panther editor Jim
Glasgow, C43. .

The predominant spirit will be

' humor. There are going to be more

pages, «more -freshness, more ﬁc-
tion (again with the humorous
rather than serious side), and more
informal student pictures. There
sketches and illustrations, a bigger
and better gossip column, he :..id.

Coverage of one or more campus
activities each month will. be an-
othervbig feature, and such affairs
as dances, fraternity parties, and
Pitt Players will be included.

Fashions will have a special sec-
tion as _will letters to the editor and
letters from boys at camp. Each
month the editorial staff of the
Panther will select a Pitt girl to
highlight one of the inside pages.
Identity of the selectee will beikept
secret until the timepthat the Pan-
ther will be on sale.

Sports are going to be covered
in the new Panther, and satires and
parodies on campus affairs will
round out the plan.

The Panther wants some new
writers to blend in with the pro-
gram of freshness and variation.
All interested and eligible students
should ‘apply at the Panther office.

Pitt Batteship Drive Sales
Pass $13,000, End May 13

By BILL PANKUCH

Bringing to a conclusion one of the most successful drives
ever conducted on the Pitt campus, Phi Mu sorority, aided by
the battleship committee, closes the war stamp campaign_ next

Wednesday.

Sales efforts by Alpha Epsilon Phillast Wednesday netted
$762.50, of which $412.50 was received from bond sales, and

$350 from the sale of stamps. The

‘ stamp sale set a new record.

Conceived early in January, the
idea for a campus defense stamp
drive was first presented by.Her-
bert Gall, M43, who was later to
become chairman of the committee.

On January 6 the committee
was formed from a very small
group of interested students. Dur-
ing the next three weeks, however,

as the committee grew and devel-
oped conﬁdence, deﬁnite plans
were made to put the effort on a
sound business-like basis.

Immediately p r e c e d i n g the
launching of the drive, the United

0 States battleship Iowa, still under

construction, was selected as the
symbol of the entire campaign.

For twoweeks ‘following the ini-
tial salesday, February 18, when
Chancellor Bowman bought the first
stamp, committee sales members
handled all sales, working from a
ground ﬂoor booth, which was a
model of the battleship Iowa.

An appropriation from the Stu-
dent-Faculty association gave the
committee funds for publicity work,
and shortly thereafter, the Tri-
Delts initiated the system of hav-
ing a different women’s fraternity

handle the battleship booth each
Wednesday.

After the Military ball commit-
tee had purchased $900 in defense
stamps, Chancellor Bowman bost-
ed the campaign totals past the
$2,000 mark with another bond pur-
chase.

By April, the University was
leading all the schools in the na-
tion in the sale of war stamps and
bonds, and the drive was further
aided by Phi Delta Theta’s pur-
chase of $1,850 in bonds.

On April 15, General MacAr-
thur Day, sales resulted in total of
$3,216.50, high water mark of the
drive. -

With the campaign drawing to
a close, total sales passed the
$10,000 mark on April 22 and have
been multiplied to the present $13,-
623.70. With one more sales’ day
remaining, the drive is likely to
reach the $15,000 mark.

Phi Mu, social fraternity, will
handle stamp and bond sales on
the ﬁnal day of the drive, and have
promised a ﬁtting climax; Bonds
may be ordered any time before
Wednesday, or may be purchased
along with stamps from the second
through the seventh period at the
battleship booth on Wednesday.

Men’s Council
Will Discuss
Keys, Lounge

First official meeting of the new
Men’s council will take place at
3:30 o’clock today. Men’s council
president Art Thompson, C43, said
that‘ the principal purpose of the
meeting will be to discuss ways of
improving the men’s lounge.

The first stepin that direction
was taken by Thompson when he
appointed Dave Truan, C44, secre-
tary, as head of the men’s lounge.

Inthis capacity, Truan will have
charge of the operation of the
lounge throughout every period of
the day. Twenty men students will
assist him in the lounge’s opera-
tion. ‘

Another topic for discussion at
the meeting will be the possibility
of amending the clause in the coun-
cil’s constitution, which reads:
“‘any member who misses two con-
secutive council meetings is sub-

ject to dismi_ssal from thecouncil.”" physics, W111 present a paper on

It is strictly out of the frying pan and into the ﬁre for

the Panther baseballers, who

still reeling from the savage

treatment they received at the hands of Temple and Army,
will meet Ohio University at the Stadium tomorrow.

The Panthers lost their four game win streak on their
eastern trip, but at that they were lucky they didn't lose their
lives. Temple struck out and stunned the Panthers with a nine-

teen hit attack that netted them
ﬁfteen runs while the best the Pan-
thers could do was ten hits and
nine runs. T _
Then, before they had a chance
to recover Army attacked them as
though they were a sub division of
the axis, battering Bill McKee for
seventeen hits and twelve runs.
During this time the Panthers just
managed to escape a shutout by
producing one feeble run. There is
evidently some‘ power of mercy
above for this game was stopped
at the end of seven innings be-
cause of darkness.

And now all the Blue and Gold
baseballers have to do is meet Ohio
University, who at present is riding
on the crest of a ten game winning
streak. One of the teams they beat
was Mickey C;ochrane’s Great Lakes
team, and Cochrane, who ought to
know, has termed the Bobcats the
greatest hitting college team he
has ever seen.

The lineup they will hurl at Pitt
will consist of I-Iarkins at second,
Wren at short. Sllvey in center.

Schively at. ﬁrst,~Collins at third. A

Cramer in right, and Brown invleft,
with Heinz doing the catching.
That inﬁeld of the Bobcats is to
be watched ‘for that is where the
batting power of the outﬁt is con-
centrated.

Bob Wren has been hitting the
ball at a fast .450 clip, in addition «
to doing a great job. at short,
“Hec” Harkins, a great defensive
player is hitting .300, and Howard
Collins, who is playing regularly"
for the first time, is a dangerous
powe_r hitter.

SPORTS EDJTOR

Nine months back we wrote an opening column. People

 

  

 

   
     
   

  

stopped speaking to us, coaches avoided us, and athletes
threatened us. That and lack of space made this column ap-

pear rather spasmodically. But we want to devote this last col-

umn with our personal thanks to those who have helped the
Pitt News sports staff during the past year.

(‘.ooperat.ion, it seems, is essential in putting out a paper,
though. at times, we felt a good dinner and a few victories
would help. But the coaches, school oﬁicials, athletes, and
downtown newspapermen were ‘great to us.

Iﬂeading the list  jovial Frank Carver, athletic publicity
director and ‘intramural head. Carver is the only man, we fell,
who had a harder time than we did, namely, continually prais-
ing badly beaten, outmanned, and outplayed ball clubs. A por-
tion of our thanks in this department are also reserved for
Ollie Stiff and Al Vesper.

In the athletic office, our thanks go forth to athletic di-
rector Jimmy Hagan. We are indebted to Mr. Hagan for his
encouragement, his aid, and his reliability as a news source.

In the coaching ﬁeld we_give a nod in the direction of Dr.
Carlson, Carl Olson, Chaley Bowser, Ben Grady, Ralph ll/litter-
ling, Nick Kliskey, Dr. Hartwig, Bobby Hoel et. al. with whose
help the sports pages could not have-been ﬁlled for they were
responsible for the teams the News writers wrote about.

The three downtown newspapers contributed a" few more

allies to our cause. For their graciousness in lending us pic-
tures, exchanging service on sports events, etc., we thank
Bill l\’IcElwain and Eddie Beachler of the Press; Tommy Hop-
kins of the Sun-Tcle; and Jack Sell of the Post-Gazette.
Lastly, the reporters on the sports staff, who have sacri-
ﬁced dinners, sleep, and social affairs to get accurate and inter-
esting coverage of the sporting events. They were all swell.
That. concludes the list. If we have left anyone out, we
are sincerely sorry. And with this_column we say, “goodbye
till next year" and thanks for reading.

Schedule at EIGA Tiltsi

I

  

K9’,

Pitt’s golfers will travel up to
Princeton this weekend to partici-
pate in the Eastern Intercollegiate

Golf Association meet, which is be» '

ing held on the Princeton home

.course. On Friday, they. will meet

Pennsylvania, and on Saturday

their opponents will he George-,
town and Princeton.

Last year’: EIGA meet ended in

a weird double-triple playoff. The

matches were held at Stanford,

Comi., with Georgetown the de-.

fending champions. '

Tied for the lead in the Southern
section were Georgetown,‘ Prince-
ton, and Penn State, while Dart-
mouth, Yale and Harvardwere like-
wise tied for the lead in the North—
ern section.

When the shooting was ﬁnished,
Princeton had taken the Southern
League crown, and Dartmouth had
nosed out its other Ivy League op-
ponents for the lead in the North.
Dartmouth won the second play-

off, and thus the 1941 EIGA cham:
pionship.
_ Pitt's“ golfers are far behind in
the race for the EIGA crown, but
they still have a ﬁghting chance.
Last week, at Cornell, they lost to
both Cornell and Penn State. When
queried about this match, Conch
Kliskey replied that two matches 1
day was too much for the boys.
He said that they were in the
running in the morning match with.
Cornell, but that the afternoon heat
ontop of the morning match com-
bined to beat them in the Penn
State contest.

Also, Kliskcy stated that Bill_ ’

Kramer, Harry Simpson, and Bob
Walkinshaw played as well as any

7 other contestant, but that they were
‘hampered by the rfailure of Steve

Bilowich and Dave Thurbon to
co-me up to pre-season expecta-B
tions.

Important meeting of all frater-
nity athletic managers in Mr. Car-

_ vet’: office today at 2:45 o'clock.

it ~racl<ster Battle Penn State Tomorro
S  Celebrated Dual Between Carter, Ewe”  
e lo ,HighIight Outdoor Cinder Contest 

By VINCE QUATRINI
When the track forces of Coach

A Carl Olson and “Chick” Werner

meet tomorrow afternoonjn the
Stadium, the age-old rivalry be-
tween Penn Stateand Pitt writes
another page in the thrill-studded
history of track relationsbetween
the two schools.

Information coming from the
Nittany Lions’ den has this year’;
State spikers labeled the greatest

V that has been produced by the
school. However, in comparison
with the other State aggregations,‘
this season’: squad is not as well
balanced. Possibly it has a two-man
team in Ewell and Gordon. .

Throughout the whole indoor and
outdoor season a majority of State’s
victories depended upon the per-
formance of “Brown Bullet” Ewell.
He will be the mainstay of the Blue
and White's chances in taking over
the Panthers. Ewell has compiled
a reputable record with only a few
shattered ones in his ﬁles.

His outstanding achievement in
his college career came when he
became the only athlete in the 65-
year history of the IC4-A meet
who has ever twice scored a triple
‘victory. In 1940 and‘ 1941, Ewell
annexed the 100, 220 and ‘broad
jump B events. ‘

The highlight of tomorrow’: nf-»
[air will undoubtedly be the “bat-~
tle Qt the bullets,” “Bullet Bill”
Carter and “Brown Bullet” Ewell.
Both boys have been meeting each
other all year, in and out, and it
has been a ton-up affair as to
which one would be. the victor. ln
one meet it was Ewell and in an»
otherit was Carter.

. Regardless, Carter will have the
edge over Ewell in_ the 100-yard

Summer Sports

Students taking the summer sem-
ester will ﬁnd the pickings mighty
lean. as far as sports are concerned,
for the one and only thing 'certain
about the summer athletic schedule
is that there will be an intramural
program.

Trackmen are expected to com-
pete in various A.A.U. meets in the
districts, but the future of baseball,
tennis, and golf during the sum-
,mer months ‘is still very doubtful.

In the case of baseball, it all de-
pends upon whether or not enough
players cometo school to make up
a team, and on their being able to
schedule opponents. ‘

In regard to tennis and golf the
situation is much. the same, no
players, no game, no opponents,
still no game. ‘

Panther lennisi Squad Meets Nittany, 

By MIKE HERMAN

' Pitt’s tennis team comes home‘

to take on a mediocre Penn State
tennis team tomorrow after trave1~
ing to West Point earlier in the
week. i

. As a matter of fact, calling the
Skaters "mediocre” may be peg»
ging them too highly, as so far
this year they have not shown any
great amount of strength.

They started off the year by ta.l<—
ing a 9-0 match from weak Susque~
hanna, duplicating the score of the
previous year, and then swept their
second match with Lehigh, 6-'3.
avenging a, 1940 setback at the

, hands of the Engineers. But after

these two wins, the men of Nittany

ran into trouble, playing matches‘

with Buclmell, Cornell, Gettysburg.
Syracuse, and Pennsylvania that
turned Coach 'l‘e,<,l Rocthke‘s hair

gray.

  
    
   

Incidentally, Roethke came to
State as an instructor in English
Composition and turned to coach-
ing tennis only four years ago: He
rgcognized as one of America’s

B .9 n or poets, and quit
“ wha lace“ uh-

ﬁner magazines, including The Ai-
lantic Monthly, New Yorker, New
Republic, and the Nation Common-
wealth. .

On the face of the State record,
Pitt rooters should be extremely
optimistic. However, Assistant
Coach Al Vesper has warned Pan-
ther followers not to expect too
much, for the Staters have a habit

of making it tough for Pitt tennis

teams. K
The 194.1 results showed the
Lions on the long end of a 8-«ll

score. lnispitc of State’: apparent
weakness and Pitt's ﬁne record,
any pre-game estimate must give

the State-r_s the bulge.
Penn State has four lettermen
returning from last yczu."s outﬁt,

which chalked up a record of 6
wins and 5 losses. Number one man.

 Lions In Annual Neti Match Tomorrow

is Chuck Bowman, Lancaster seni-
or. Alsa returning are John Knode.

Bill Lundelius, and Donald Parker. I

Pitt will ﬁeld the same team
which has played. all of its home
matches. This combination, which
has, Med Student Bob Nickeson
playingthe number four spot, is
unbeaten. Nickeson. is unable to
travel with the team. so Jack Wynn
plays in his spot when the Pan-
thers play away from home.

Wynn will mpve back to number
five tomorrow, and Jim Deutel-
baum will play number six. ln the
first three spots will be Dick Trim-
ble, Henry C-rance, and Bill Reese.

The doubles combinations will
probably show Trimble and Grance
in the first match, Reese and Wynn
in the second, and Deutelbaum anal
Bob Gayle-n in the third.

At this writing, the Lions have
only taken on one opponent and

swept first places in all but one of
the nine running events. in the,

Sandwiched in with this victory

ing accomplishmenii. At Philaclel-p
phia two weeks ago the Lions were ’
again crowned" as they took home ;
the sprint medley relay champiom ,
ship at the Penn Relay Carnival-

dash and other events due to the
fact that Carterwill be in his own
backyard and familiar with the
oval. Nevertheless, Carter will be
taxed to the limit to overcome the
Lion ﬂash.

State’s power punch lies in its
running. Not only Ewell, but with
a quartet of distance men that in-
cludes Norm Gordon, MacClain
Smith, Herm Goffberg and Curt
Stone. Top man is Gordon, who was
instrumental in the Lion’s IC4-A
and Penn Relay triumphs. The
Jungle Cats will have to pin their
hopes on Bill Curtis to overcome
this outstanding distance pacer.

Coach Carl Olson’: forces will
have to depend on. upsetting the
Lions in the ﬁeld events where
Penn is considered to be much
weaker. But with the loss of Jes-
sup and Elliott theoutloolc is not
as rosy as was at first anticipated.

The brunt of the attack in the
ﬁeld will have to be carried by
“Dusty” Rhohdes. Then, too, he
will have to be in top form to sub-
due Captain Joe Bakura in the
pole vault, asthis boy soared over
the bar at‘ 13 feet 5 inches.

The most optimistic side of the
Panther’s gaining any laurels are
in the hurdle events. Gene Nevill

with president and secretary, was
i the Student Welfare Program of

_Hiram Milt'on,,’42. Milton present-
‘ "led his program in person.
‘ Milton’s program was adopted by
E the assembly with only a few scat-

cost , social activities, engineers
problems, and interhonorary, scho-
lastic and activities councils.
