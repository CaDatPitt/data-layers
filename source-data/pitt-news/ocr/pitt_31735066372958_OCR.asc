Financial Cutbacks Hurt Students

“We feel ~ that...a substantive

Rally Calls For World Peace  

By PEGGY FERRI

It was a celebration of life with a
message for the world.

A record number of people
poured into the streets of New York
City on June 12 calling for world
peace and nuclear disarmament.

A kaleidoscope of humanity
marched past the United Nations
Building and then streamedinto
Central Park for nearly five hours
of speeches ‘and songs.

They came from Europe, South
America, Japan, Canada and Aus-
trailia. They were of all ages-
young children concerned about a
‘future they may never knowand
senior citizens worried about those
to follow.

They arrived by every possible
means of transportation, and some
continued along First Avenue on
stilts, roller skates and in wheel
chairs. -

The march was led by the Child-
rens Walk for Life and followed by
more than a score of national and
international organizations
encompassing people from over
500 American cities.

Pittsburghers arriving by buses
chartered by the Thomas Merton
Center assembled on 52nd Street,
making up the tail end of a line

7 stretching nearly two miles.

Cries of "two, four, six, eight-

heard. "

There were banners, placards,
balloons and a giant blow-up, blue

The entertainment also reflected
the anti-nuclear theme. There were

Jjugglers, mime-skeletons, folk sin-

Jackson Browne, Bruce Spring-

and Joan Baez were just a few of the

in,p1ogress until July 9. In l978,
the first Special Session on Dis-
armament adopted a final docu-
ment that vowed to strive for the
cessation of the production of fis-
sionable material for weapons pur-
poses. The hopes of the a peace
movement are focused on the Uni-

_ted Nations. -
"Sister Christopher-Marie came
from Philadelphia because she said
that she believed in peace.
“I’m scared,” she admitted, “not
for myself, but for children. I have

’ lots of nieces and nephews, and I’d

like them to have dreams instead of
nightmares.”

A young hitchhiker from Massa-
chusetts came, he said, “to be a part
of history. I’ve never seen so many

—people. It’s so peaceful—no one

has done anything violent at all.”
On the route to Central Park, a
group" of Japanese citizens were
singing and handing out origami
cranes—the Japanese symbol of
peace. Most of them could not
speak English, but one woman, a
survivor of Nagasaki, demanded
that there be no more Nagasakis.
“Peace,” she added simply.
“We’re here because we're
against all nuclear weapons,” the

grey-haired director of the Shalom.

Mountain Retreat explained. “We
believe that a whole new vision of
the earth has to emerge if people
are going to live on this planet.”
Rally speakers also decried the
cost and implications of an arms
race. Various political and reli-
gious speakers were present -to
make short speeches to the crowd-
all called for a stop to the arms race.

pessimism. 7

Among the changes in the stu-
dent aid program isthe govern-
ment’s enforcement of previous/
legislation that requires students
receiving aid to show “normal pro-
gress.” For a Pitt student, this
means completing 12 credits per
term or 24 credits in a‘ year.

This rule has always existed, but

now monitoring the academic pro- '

Crime at Pitt declined by 20iper-

cent in 1981 compared to the pre-

vious year's report, but for the
period of January to April 1982,
crime has risen 3 percent in com-
parison to the same period of 1981,

according to James Watters, police I A

lieutenant. -
Watters said there'were a total of" .
2,179 reported crimes, in 1980 as
compared to 1,742 in 1981. He said.
there were a total of 667 reported
crimes during the January to April
1982 perioid, while in 1981 during '
the same period, there wer 639.
“Theft is always the number one
category of reported incidents,”
Watters said. In 1981, total number
of thefts was 702 out of a total of
1,742 reported crimes. —
The ‘university police are trying
to stress a “proactive” way of
thinking, where typically it’s func-

tion has been viewed as reactive,

Watters said.

“It is more profitable to prevent
crimes than to try to recover and
replace property, and prosecute the
criminal,” Watters said.

He said the problem with the
loss of property is negligence; 66
percent of all thefts are a result of -
contributing negligence.

Burglaries on campus in l98l
totalled 42. There were four robber-
ies and 26 assaults, Watters said.

In 1982, up.to and including
April, there were 216 thefts, two
robberies, four burglaries and I0
assaults, according to Watters. _

Graduate Students Resign

By ROCHELLE STEVWING

Two executive committee
members of the Council of Gradu-
ate ‘Students in ‘Education
(C.G.S.E.) have tendered their
resignations as a result of contro-
versies arising from a breach in the
C.G.S.E. bylaws, according to
john Abuso, a C.G.S.E. member
who served as program coordinator
for three years. ,
rity,” Abuso said.

The resigning members are
Patrick Socoski, who was elected as

C.G.S.E. treasurer by a unanimous '

vote, and Matala Mapela, who was
elected to the office of member-at-
large.

“As executive officers continue
their meetings to address the issue
of its elections procedures on May
13, 1982, one proposal was that

' those elected on the May 13 ballot
submit their resignations to the
Council,"- C.G.S.E. advisor, Dr.
William Thomas said. “In that

A way, there might be another elec-

tion following the renomination of
a slate of officers.”

Thomas, a professor of educa-
tion, said, “I have no knowledge
yet of who has submitted resigna-
tions and who has not.”

Socoski said he had turned in his
letter of resignation to the C.G.S.E.
office sometime last week along
with Mapela.

“I thought the elections were
carried out improperly in terms of
the procedure itself. I believe there

*were certain illegalities," Socoski
said. .

He reported that Marge Weimer,
C.G.S.E. president-elect, had for-
mally resigned yesterday.

The elections were held May 13,
and there was a question of
whether or not those people attend-
ing the meeting were eligible to
vote.

The C.G.S.E. bylaws outline its
membership criteria in the follow-
ing manner:

The financial burden of higher
education is going to shift from the
federal and state governments to
the student, with the middle-class
student being the hardest hit, Jack
Freeman, senior vice chancellor for
administration said. -

Freeman spoke at the Graduate
School of Public and International

A Affairs noon lecture series on plan-

ning and financing the university
in the l980’s held Wednesday June
9. . -

~ Freeman said that there is a sig-
nificant decline of federal and state
~institutional support in “real”
terms. Pitt gets less money per cap-

—' ita in Pennsylvania in terms of real

dollars (deflated dollars).
Inflation has had a very signifi-

' cant effect at Pitt, Freeman said.

“We can no longer allow a suici-

masses of people."

tion are eligible for active
membership on the Council.

0 A student may become an
active member by submitting a
membership application or a peti-
tion for membership.

0 An active member shall receive
a membership card for the aca-
demic year and notices of regular
meetings and other functions.

0 To remain an active member
one must attend at least 50 percent
of the Council meetings or partici-
pate in committee work.

0 No member shall have more
than one vote on all matters com-
ing before the Council.

0 Each council member shall: a)
communicate the concerns and
decisions of the Council to students
in his program area of the School
of Education; and, b) communicate
the concerns and ideas of his stu-

‘dent constituents to the Council.

After four hours of debate, Susan
Smith, elections committee chair-
person, accepted a decision permit-
ing everyone present at the meeting
to vote.

According to a sign-up sheet cir-
culated at the meeting, there were
22 people present for the
elections—l3 active members and
nine non-members.

Another violation of the bylaws
occurred when the Council
members accepted absentee ballots
and votes by proxy. Since the

Council adheres to Roberts’ Rules-

of Order, these votes were illegal.

“The issue right now is one of
philosophy and principles," said
Arlene Seal, a C.G.S.E. member
and a candidate for the office of
C.G.S.E. vice-president.

It was previously reported that
Seal had received the majority of
votes for that office, however that
information was incorrect. Leki-
Leki Katona was elected to the
office of vice-president.

There was a discrepancy in the
number of votes counted; a second
vote revealed that Katona had I6

Total support during the period of
1971-1981 has increased from $120
million to $235 million, according
to Freeman.

However, when these figures are
deflated, it is revealed that‘ total
support actually fell from $120
millon in l97l to $110 millon in
1981.

The increase is really illusion-
ary, he said, "as enrollment has
increased l2 percent. “We are eally
doing more with -less as a conse-
quence of inflation alone," Free-
man said. “Higher education is no
longer a high public priority in
most states."

Freeman said the fiscal constric-
tion will be aided by the nearly 50

percent decrease in financial aid for ,

students.
Freeman said however, that Pitt
has been very fortunate that Pen-

lion workers at the rally.

“The Reagan Administration,"
he said, “tells us that certain arma-
.ments are good for the economy. It
costs one billion dollars of MX
missiles t() ptit to work 14,000
workers, but that same money
would also give you -1.3.000 health
care workers. ,

“What the hell kind of society is
this?" Gotbauiii asked. “We don't
need it, we don't want it—-it stinks.
Tell them’ to stick it up their ass!"

votes to Seal’s 15. ~

Since the May 13 elections, a
joint executive committee has
agreed unanimously that only
active members, as outlined in the
bylaws, are eligible to vote. There-
fore, the committee agreed that the
elections were illegal, but not all
committee members would agree
that the elections were invalid.

On Thursday, June 10, an unof-
ficial meeting was held, according
to Seal. ‘

"I appeared at the meeting to
voice that it was not an official
meeting because the membership
had not been notified and again
stated that no votes could be taken

V because most of the people at the

meeting were not active members,”
Seal said. '

Socoski also attended the unoffi-
cial meeting. He said that he only
stayed long enoligh to “protest the
legitimacy of the meeting."

The C.G.S.E. bylaws state that
“all members of the Council must
.be notified in advance of all meet-
ings of the Council and all meet-
ings held in the name of the
Council."

Abuso said that during his three
years on the Council, all meetings
were announced three days in
advance by written notification.
Last Thursday's meeting was not
mentioned to all of the members,
according to Socoski. _

_ Many other problems have come
to light as a result of the C.G.S.E.
elections, among these problems is
the charge that the elections were
the result of ethnic politics.

In a letter to the editor, Abuso
wrote, “ethnic politics recently
occurred in the Council of Gradu-
ate Students in Education when
certain candidates for office mobil-
ized their respective groups-
African and Afro-American-——to
win the elections on May 13.”

Arlene Sealconcluded, “I feel
very strongly about participating
in an organization that is in any
way perpetuating division among
people based on a race, religion or
nationality. I think that is why
many of us are in a position of
offering resignations."

nsylvania’s legislators recently
passed a six percent increase in aid
over the previous year.

HE said this increase is desirable
and “we are doing very well." Even
though Pitt has not done much bet-
terthan the six percent increase in
previous years, the increaseshave
been steady and reliable, he said.

“We have not had to take five or
six or I0 percent reductions, and
that is a very important contributor
to our financial help," Freeman
said. '

Services for students will
improve, according to Freeman.
Services such as residence life and
food services will improve because
of competition.

Declines in college age students
(I8 to 22), is the “single most dra-

matic force" that Pitt_has to deal

more involved. “We women call
upon the women of the world to
join with us and turn the leaders
away from the destruction of gener-
ations." she said.

The rally is over now. and the
throngs of people have gone home.

kidnappings reported for either
period. «

When asked if the reason for the
absence of more serious crimes is
due to unreported crimes, Watters
responded, “typically, the more
serious crimes are reported.”

He said there is a general lack in
reporting of various crimes. Unre-
ported crimes cause a loss of per-
ception on the part of the police.

“We rely on reported trends, and
it hurts us from the standpoint of
not having that input," Watters
said. He said the police can't
mobilize special tactical units,
such as the plainclothes units, as a
result.

The data on rapes, he said, are
much more accurate; generally,
less than 30 percent go unreported.
In the 19605 and early 1970s, only

about 25 percent were reported, but —

now due to more support systems,
better police training for handling
of rape victims, and the courts have
a stronger position for the defense
of women. Thus rape is more often
reported, he said. i _

Watters said the Pitt police
department has in the last five
years, cleared and handled reported
rapes identifying. the perpetrator;
some went to court, others didn’t.

There is an estimated daily cam-
pus population of 40,000, and gen-
eral person crimes have gone
down, he said.

*Watters added that the police
break the campus down into five
zones, all of which reflect the same
number of people, but may cover
larger geographical areas.

The areas most highly affected
by crime are the dormitories, the
Student Union, Trees’ Hall, the
Cathedral of Learning, Hillman
Library, the Alumni building and
Benedum Hall. .

The department made a study of
the peak period during the day for
crime commission and found that
it was different from that of other
parts of the city, according to
Watters.

Due to the diverse activites of
campus life, such as bars offering
reduced prices on Wednesdays and
Thursdays, crimes occurred more
often on Monday through Friday
than on weekends. The time of day
crime peaked was between the
hours of 6:00 p.m. and 8:00 p.m.

Watters said that as far as univer-
sities go, Pitt experiences -lower
“people" crimes than other univer-
sities of its size.

ning demonstrations to greet the
President. The issue of disarma-
ment will probably be an issue in
future elections," Cagan
explained.

Cagan said that the rally made
two importaiit statements: one.
that the nation issick of hearing
that world powers'(‘an use nuclear
armaments in a limited way; and
two, that this administration has
its priorities upside-down and the
military budget has to be cut.

Cagan added that she disagrres

Students are more likely to be
victims simply by the fact that there
are more of them on campus, Wat-
ters said.

However, younger people are
more often victims than older peo-
ple, but “there is not a group that is
disproportionately victims given
the percentage of population,” he
said. _

Educating the university com-
munity about personal safety to
reduce the likelihood of victimiza-
tion is“ also a, function of the
“proactive” police method. All
police officers have special train-

ing in proactive techniques. Wat-~~

ters said this is [the same

information that people should _

have anywhere, and that these tech-
niques and principles generally
should be followed. '

“This is an open social (aca-
demic) setting, and people don't
realize the possibility of something
happening to them,” Watters said.
“They take buses late at night,
leave their property unattended
and take shortcuts to buildings.

The student should consider
their schedule so as to avoid late
night traveling and should,under-
stand the best routes to take to
buildings.”

In keeping with the “proactive”
way of thinking, the department
does Premise Security Surveys.
They look at the physical structure
of a building, the key control and
the operational and practical uses
of the equipment, according to
Watters. The survey is then pub-
lished for the people in that com-
plex, including recommendations
for ways to reduce costs and secure
equipment and personal property.

The department is _ using the
existing organizations on
campus-—such as the Office of Res-
idence Life and the Staff Advisory
Board—to sit down and discuss
ways of avoiding being a victim.
They sponsored a self-defense
seminar last
meeting with incoming freshmen
and their parents to talk about the
available resources on campus.

One such meeting will be held
today at 1:30 p.m. and on Thursday
at 11:00 a.m. in the David’ Law-
rence Auditorium.

The department consists of 56
uniformed officers, 15 guards, five
plainclothes men, three detectives,
eight uniformed sergeants, one ser-
geant for community relations,
four sergeants for training and pay-
roll and one key-control

 procedure is designed to
eliminate some of the abuses that
have taken place in the past as far as
aid money is concerned,” Werd-
mann said. '

The student aid office is also
changing their allocation of
campus-based financial awards,
such as work-study or Student Edu-
cational Opportunity Grants, and
university scholarships and grants,
she reported. These aid monies
controlled by the university were
formerly distributed according to a
syenfs total need—tuition,
r om, board, books, lab fees and
‘miscellaneous expenses. Now the
office will concentrate on a stu-
dent's invoiced fees——room, board
and tuition—when determining
the students award, she said.

In addition, banks now have
more stringent requirements for
students to demonstrate need,
Werdmann said. _

Wilfried Daehnick, chairman of
the Senate Budget Policies Com-
mittee and a professor of physics
and astronomy, submitted a report
comparing the university's budgets
for the past five years.

According to the 16-month
st " \__I. Pitt has managed to keep

parable inflated prices. This was
done by economizing on budgets
and salary increases, Daehnick

reported. In this period, inflation
reached 51.5 percent according to
the Consumer Price Index.

“It's our impression that, not
(being in) red ink, (Pitt) has done
reasonably well," Daehnick said in
some personal commentary deli-

:

vered after his report. “From where

I sit, it seems that much of this
black ink...has come at the expense
of employees’ paychecks which
have risen by only 40 percent in the
period where inflation rose 51
percent.”

Daehnick cited the “constantly
shrinking purchasing power of the
state support provided" as Pitt’s
main problem to face in the 1980s.
' Since the university is faced with
this problem, Daehnick questi-

.oned whether maintenance of
Pitt’s large enrollment, a high
priority for the administration,
remains good policy. He cited a
report, which stated that several
schools receive a higher amount of
state aid per capita than Pitt does,
as evidence that state support is
unrelated to enrollment.

Total enrollment at the Oakland
campus has dropped 1.6 percent in
the last five years, according to the
committee’s report. However, if
branch campus figures are
included, Pitt experienced a .6 per-
cent rise in enrollment during the
past five years.

ful” johnstown policy planning
meeting, Chancellor Wesley Pos-
var announced plans by Faculty of
Arts and Sciences Dean Jerome
Rosenberg to trim the faculty by
50-plus members over the next five
years.

The cuts will be made “through

attrition hopefully,” Posvar said,
and will be concentrated in areas
where demand has been reduced.
A Admissions have risen slightly
compared to last year's figures, and
there has been a substantial
increase in transfers, the Chancellor
said.

“(This) may tell us something
about the economic situation in
the 1980s and the difficulties of pri-
vate education (in it)," he said.

Construction of the business
school will begin in two weeks,
Posvar said. In addition, he
announced preliminary plans for
installing night game lights in Pitt
stadium. . »

Posvar defended the cost of the
lights, which he estimated to be
“between one and two million dol-
lars,” by saying the lights will
bring increased television oppor-

Wturiities and will thus increase uni-

versity revenue.

“This is being used as an invest-
ment....This is not putting football
and lights.ahead of anything else.

It's a way to produce revenue for
the university. for other good
things. So if anyone wants to make
a case against this, they're going to
have to makea case against increas-
ing revenue," Posvar said.

The lights will increase the util-
ity of the stadium field 75-I00 per-
cent as well as improve the safety of
the stadium area, Posvar added.

In other business, the Policy
Resource and Marianagement Sys-
tem statement on the termination
of the geography department will
be completed this month, Rosen-
berg said.

However, the usual 30-day
response period for senate officers
will be waived. according to Wes-
Iey Rohrer, chairman of the senate.
This will avoid the evaluation of
the proposal during the summer
months when few faculty members
are present at the university, he
said.

In another report presented to

‘ the senate, the mandatory attend-
ance policy for athletes was
reviewed and amended.

Pitt’s program for suspending

athletes from competition for not ‘

attending classes has attracted
some national interest and could
conceivably become a National
Collegiate Athletic Association
regulation, according to obstetrics
and gynegology professor Dou-
glass S. Thompson, chairman of
the'Senate Committee on Athletics.

with in the years ahead, Freeman
said. In Western Pennsylvania, the
trend during the period 1975 to

1990 will be a 31 percent decline in .

enrollment in traditional college-
age students, Freeman predicted.

There will be a 21 percent
increase in the 23 to 45 year old age
groups, and a 28 percent decline in
the 46 to 60 age group, he added.

Nationally, the decline in enrol-
lment is twice that of Western Pen-
nsylvania, he said.

Freeman said the problem for
Pitt is maintenance of current lev-
els ‘ of enrollment. He said that
enrollment polls showed an 18 per-
cent national decline in undergrad-
uate students, and a five percent
decline for graduate students.

Freeman said this is a very
serious problem for Pitt since
‘enrollment polls show a 31 percent
decrease for undergraduate stu-
dents from Western Pennsylvania
where the university draws 90 per-
cent of their students. Polls also
showed an 11 percent decline of
graduate students from Western

Pennsylvania.

There will be a change in the
definition of a “quality” institu-
tion, according to Freeman.

He predicted that the number of
institutions are going to decrease as
well as become smaller and poorer.
Economic stagnation is likely to set
in, Freeman continued. Because of
this, he said, some institutionswill
have to close their doors, faculty
and staff sizes will be reduced,
salaries will not grow at the rate of
inflation and tuition will reduce
access to federal student aid.

He added that physical plants
will deteriorate, construction will
be halted and program diversity
will decline.

Institutional cooperation is
likely to deteriorate Freeman‘ said,
and went on to predict that compe-
tition for students, dollars and
public attention will “intensify.”

He said new definitions of lib-
eral education will be seen that put
more emphasis on career educa-
tion, thus threatening the tradi-
tional ideal" of liberal arts
education.

T he senate vot_ed to accept the
committee's two recommended
changes in the policy.

First, only first term freshmen
and transfer students who have
athletic scholarships or who are
required by their coach must par-
ticipate in the program. Formerly,
all first year athletes had their
attendance monitored.

The second amendment pro-
vided that all students who have a

“probation QPA” will be moni- ,

tored even if their dean has not
declared them to be on academic
probation. Before this amendment,
only the formal declaration of aca-
demic probation by the dean could
place the athlete back in the moni-
toring system. -

The chancelloralso announced
the separation of the theater arts
programs from the speech and
theater arts department and the'
merger of the administration of
justice program with the Graduate
School of Public and International
Affairs.

Board of trustee member Roger
S. Ahlbrandt, a former chairman of
the board, has been elected trustee
emeritus, Posvar said. He reported
that Edward Walker, chairman of
Gulf Oil, and Joan Srnith, former
president of the General Alumni
Association and the Engineering
Alumni Association, were elected
to the board of trustees.

ifting

Wealthy institutions such as Pitt
will remain reasonably comforta-
ble,while poor institutions will get
poorer, Freeman said.

He said marketing strategies will
dominate planning and have pro-
found influence on programs.

,These will determine priorities of

resource allocation.

“Inflation is likely to be with us
for our future planning, and we
have anticipated a rate of seven per-
cent to 10 percent overthe next five
or six years,” he said.

Freeman said he didn’t expect
business within Pitt to change
drastically. He said he expects the
classroom experience to remain

_much the same ten years from now.

“We have not benefitted from
technology, despite the fact that we
are chief advocates of it," Freeman
said.

Whatwill change, Freeman said,
is the quality and focus of educa-
tional research as defined in the last
25 years. He said the research fund
is shifting and declining, and more
applied research will be seen.

Profile:

By DIANE LEFKOWITZ

When told The Pitt News wanted
to do a profile of him, John Roberts
was concerned that there were not
enough “zings” in his work for an
interesting story.

On the contrary as this respected
anthropology professor is leading a
busy, as well as “zingy,” career in a
rather low-keyed but highly impor-
tant field of study—the expressive,
“non-rational” side of humanity.

Last month he was elected to the
National Academy of Sciences, a
much-coveted honor bestowed on
60 people a year. As of last year, it

consisted of about 1,300 members, '

primarily in the fields of physics and
mathematics. Roberts is one of 45
members representing anthropol-

‘ ogy.

He thinks that his election was
due to an accumulation of several
small studies he conducted rather

than one or two major projects. He
is currently working on several of
these small studies, ranging from
Chinese poetry to the anthropologi-
cal side of machine work and the
behavior of people as they drive
automobiles.

“I always have something going
on in games,” Roberts said.

He is finishing a study of Norwei-
gian children’s games, and began
research about, the games Peruvian
children play. He recently published
a paper about the people who play
tavern-pool.

His interest in anthropology
began as a child growing up in Lin-
coln, Nebraska. In the summertime
his family would visit the western
part of the state, where he observed
American Indians. That interest
developed as he saw Indian replicas
in museums and elsewhere.

He attended the University of
Nebraska as an undergraduate, did
his graduate work at the University
of Chicago and received his doctor-
ate from Yale University.

In the 1950s he did field research
with the Navajo and Zuni Indian
tribes in the Southwest. Their activi-
ties sparked his interest in expres-
sive culture—the behavior of people
engaging in cultural or recreational
activities.

Roberts taught at Harvard, the
University of Nebraska and the Uni-
versity of Minnesota, and he spent
13 years teaching at Cornell Univer-
sity before coming to Pitt in 1971.

“Pitt really had quite a distin-
guished anthropology department
at one time,” he said."

He liked the fact that Pitt’s depart-
ment emphasized cross-cultural
research, one of his specialty fields.
Coincidentally, two of his predeces-
sors in the department are also
members of the National Academy
of Sciences.

‘In the past he has served as presi-
dent of the Society of Cross-
Cultural Research, American
Ethnological Society, Northeastern
Anthropological Association and
the Anthropological Association for

Of Anthropology

the Study of Play.

He remains a members of each of
these organizations today. _

Although it may sound as if his
work has little interest to the general
public, Roberts’ research covers a
variety of fields relevant to people
everywhere. ‘

Some of these studies include the 

attitudes of blacks towards cars,
arranged marriages from a cross-
cultural point of view and the
expressive effects of war.

‘‘I don’t want (to see) somebody
push the button because of expres-
sive reasons,” he said. ‘‘I can see this
possibly happening in the Falklands.
In big wars, people die like crazy.”

Much of the work he does is colla-
borative, partly because he does not
usually know the language of the
people he studies. ‘

“To do really good work, one
must understand the language,” he
said.

“Normally, though, when I work
with people from other cultures, we"
share so many interests I find
(research) easy to do. There are
very few barriers.

“A lot of people don’t think that
(Americans) have developed the
best ways of,life.”

Roberts has published a few
monographs through museums
about American Indians such as
“Zuni Law," examining the legal sys-
tem of the Zuni tribe.

One of Roberts’ main hopes is to
do further research on the anthro-
pological side of machine work in
our culture. Machines in which he is
particularly interested include air-
planes, shotguns and automobile.

Not far from the age of retire-
ment, he expects to continue his
work in some capacity after he has
finished teaching.

Although it may not be one of the
most well-known careers, anthro-
pology (particularly expressive and
cross-cultural) is far from a bland
field of study, and Roberts’ note-
worthy career has been sprinkled
with quite a few “zings” along the
way.

Academic Planning Discussed
pg.

The Pitt News, Wednesday, Juife I6,’ 1982

——Page 5-‘

y CAROL KROWITZ

Pitt academic administrators
met at the Johntown campus for a
three-day planning workshop
early this month. June 2-4 were
days that 160 individuals devoted
to the discussion of six subject
areas all specifically focused to ena-
ble serious analysis and hopefully
lead to action in the coming year.

According to Chancellor Wesley
Posvar, the main topics discussed
were: faculty work conditions,
terms and incentives; changing
modes of instruction and educa-
tional technology; expanding and
improving student constituencies;
external relations and perceptions
of the University; the research mis-
sion; and the international
dimension.

A session of small groups consi-
dered ideas for better services and
cost savings.

The chancellor discussed and
updated such matters as the Fiscal
Year 1983 budget, library organiza-
tion, curriculum reform, and pros-

pects for federal program support,

Overall, the workshop partici-
pants identified and discussed ways
to improve the university.

Last year’s workshop, which

‘kw-as held at Lakeview, West Virgi-

E.

 

nia, dealt with broad themes of
resource stringency, priority-
setting and efficiency according to
the chancellor.

This year’s format differed in
that academic administrators-—
department chairmen, deans, aca-
demic center directors, senate
officers and representative faculty
spent longer periods of time on
specific topics, and the results of
the discussion should serve as a
basis for study in the fall term, the
chancellor said.

No singular
emphasized.

Rather, “we discussed our.prob—
lems on the basis of a consensus

issue was

with a common’ understanding
that the univcrsity’s problems are
all of our problems, and we have to
work together to improve our
resource management and effi-
ciency as a team," Dr. Posvai‘
stated. ’

One of the main student issues
discussed was expanding and
improving student constituencies.
A number of questions dealing
with this topic were, according to
Joseph Merante, director of Admis-
sions and Student .=.fu.l, as follows:

0 Are the current .‘.(inllSSl0nS
standards to the tiiiticrgradtiate,
graduate and professional pro-
grams appropriate to the universi-
ty's mission and goals? If not. how
should they be changed?

0 If recruitment efforts fail to
produce a sufficient number of
qualified students under current or
revised admissions standards to
meet enrollment goals, should the
standards be modified to maintain
enrollment levels?

0 Given the fact that the univer-
sity has fewer undergraduate entry
tracks than other public iiniversi-
ties, how can and should the uni-
versity respond to the increasing
demand from both students and the
business and professional com-
munities for career-oriented
education?

0 How can the university better
attract and retain undergraduate
students of exceptional ability?

I Should the universityexpand
opportunities for_ part-time liberal
arts, professional and graduate
study for mid-careerrand older stu-
dents? If so, in what special areas?

0 What can be done to streng-
then the university's efforts to
recruit and retain minority stu-
dents, especially students of high
academic potential?

“Colleg:,r-s ;a.i‘i(l universities have
been put in a new and difficult
position in maintaining quality in

Burden

“The influence of corporate
America will increase significantly
in teaching, and we will see greater
demands for career education
oriented to the needs of the busi-
ness industry,” Freeman said.

Freeman said “the challenge to
the: leadership and the faculty will
be to sustain the quality of the aca-
demic enterprise.

“The major question facing Pitt
and other institutions of higher
education is how to maintain and

. and

Shﬂﬁng

improve the quality of academic
programs under conditions of dec-
lining enrollment, rising costs and
continued economic ui'icei'tainty,”
Freeman said.

He said one approach is to
develop an effective system for
coinprehensive institutional
planning. -

“Planning forms the framework
within which other management
functions——organizing, directing
r,ontrolling——have to be a
(part) wt,“ Freeman said.

an era when there are tliiiiinishing
numbers of students," i\lt‘l‘illllt’
e.\'plained. "Iii Peiiiisylvania, asin
many other places, there has been a
decrease of 34 percent in the l7-
year-old age group. But, regardless
of what happens, quality (of the
student body) will be maiiitained."

According to the chancellor.
efforts are being made to maintain
enrollment.

“We are making special efforts to
add new programs, to recruit better
and, in particular, to provide
opportunities for students in mid-
career," Posvar said.

“It is true that the number of
people from l8-22 has decreased,
but people in the 30 to 40 age group
has increased in the same period of
time. If we appeal to new markets
there’s some possibility that our
enrollment can stay at the same

level."

A major session regarding
faciilty work conditions, terms and
incentives was scheduled, ac(ord-
ing to Dr. Robert L. Wolke direc-
tor of the Office of Faculty
Developinent.

According to Wolke, one of the
questions dealing with faculty con-
cerns was what are some reasonable
options for planning, monitoring
and evaluating the activities of
faculty members?

"Faculty members do a vast var-
iety of things," Wolke said. “Some
undergraduates often tend to see
faculty work from one point of
view--teaching being the main
job. But there is the research and

coinmitee responsibilities; some

faculty do administration. It's a
complex job.

Women’s Fight
    For Rights

Despite some gains in social and economic
areas, it’s clear from the recent actions of state I
and national lawmakers -that women must

, become more politically aware and active in
order to defend their rights.‘ _

_ That was the message given by Sarah Wed-
dington, former assistant to Jimmy Carter, who
spoke at the Women’s -Political Caucus Con-
vention of Allegheny County last week.

Weddington’s message ’ bears_ special impor-
tance considering the following decisions made
on women’s issues in the last few months:

OThe death of North Carolina’s Equal
Rights Amendment (ERA) at the hands of that -

’ state’,s legislators;
OThe Pennsylvania legislators’ decision ‘to
. kill a bill criminalizing rape committed within
the bounds of marriage; _

The bill was backed by university studies on
the psychological effects of rape, most of which
were conducted here at Pitt.

The debate that took place on the bill, how-
ever, was a perfect example of sexism within the

‘Pennsylvania legislature. The argument that
marriage is n_ot a license to rape was all but
ignored by_ the lawmakers, many of whom were
content to treat the issue as a joke.

0The anti-abortion law.

The point here is that a law affecting women
was designed without their advice or input.

fNearly all legislators approved the act, which
was then sent to the governor. The version he
signed was devised after consultation with two
anti-abortion legislators. Pro-choice and
women’s groups have complained that they
were left out of the negotiations, and are charg-
ing that Governor Thornburghdeceived them.

While it’s not our intention to decide who is
right on the abortion issue, the fact remains that
women—the ones who are affected most by the
legislation—should have been consulted.

With the ERA deadline fast approaching, it’s
more important now for women, and especially
younger women, to become an active force in
politics. '

Recently, state and local women’s groups
began to form political action committees to
aid female candidates and causes ’

As Weddington correctly pointed out, young
women can ill afford to take their rights for
granted. If they, along with much of the current
student generation, remain politically passive,
they will lose the gains earlier achieved by the
women’s movement.

The Pitt News, Wednesday, June 16, 1982

    
 
   
   
  

Dear Editor: I

I recently had an argument with
a scholar over his contention that
America’s problems with the
Soviet Union could have been
quite easily nipped in the bud by
American forces if they had pro-
ceeded to conquer war-torn Russia
after the Second World \’\’.-u.

I contended that I(. have turned
on Russian who had l‘ét"t"!l .m ally in
our defeat over Nazi‘ Germany
would have risked the very ideas
America represented. How would
the rest of the world perceive such
action by America? America had to

rebuild a ravished Europe and a A

devastated Japan-—all of course
which were in her best interests to
do. '
He went_on to profess that Amer-
ica in having forfeited victory in
Vietnam. was an example of
another mistake inherent in the
dilemma she faces today. I

responded by saying that short of —

the use of nuclear weapons, Amer-
ica could not win that “war.”
China vowed to match us tank for

tank, man for man, and China was ,

within a border distance away.
He continued by pointing out
Russia's advancing influence in
the world that would culminate in
what he felt would be the isolation
of America and strangulation of its
markets throughout the world, but
I felt that due to America’s depend-

ence on the nature of those very ‘
markets, she is much more the

aggressor while at the same time
claiming that it is Russia who is
the malevolent adventurist.

He went.on to say that due to the
dog eat‘ dog nature of man, it is
better that America is on top rather
than Russia, therebyjustifying any
use of force deemed necessary by
the U.S.; for instance a full scale
invasion into El Salvador in the
event that arms sent to the U.S.-
backed junta proves ‘not to be
enough.

I expressed the belief that El Sal- -

vador is only one country out of
many that has the potential to
develop into a similar problem for
the U.S. Let‘s have a healthy,Amer-
ica, but not at the expense of the
Salvadorians, Palestinians, Leba-
nese, etc. How long can America

squash the very principles strived.

for by the people of other countries

and which she used in becoming’

the sovereign nation she is? Soviet
imperialism in Eastern Europe can
be seen as a defensive resistance
against western hegemony. The
U.S. was pounding at the door in
Southeast Asia.‘ If U.S. interests
had their way, they. would have a

Can the U.S. ever’ contribute to
world peace ‘while her policies
remain incompatible with types of
systems that are benefiting to the

"majority of people in these coun-

tries? Third World countries
should be left undeterred to
develop economic and governmen-
tal systems best suited to meet the
prevailing circumstances in which
these people live, even if it means

central planning or the social prin- .

ciples of,Marxism. Of course this is
a threat to the continuing prosper-
ity of the wealthiest people in
America and can be, as was agrued
by my friend, a threat to my stand-
ard of life andperhaps my very free-
dom, but I challenge him to prove
the validity of this great “Commu-
nist threat.” The Domino Theory
has not transpired as was forecasted
by many following the outcome of
Vietnam.

The government's inadequate
protection of the environment
(amplified by the Reagan adminis-
tration), coupled with its danger-
ous radiation standards is a threat
to the overall health of all Ameri-
cans. One of the essential purposes
of our government is‘ to represent

‘our best interests, not to have its

various agencies, EPA, NRC, FDA,
etc., cater to the whims of a wealthy
minority’s profit quotas. What’s
best. for the rich is not compatible
with what’s best for all. Our real
enemies, though well camou-
flaged, reside in our own society.
The necessity of collusion
between the military and education
succeeds in warping the creative
conscience into a programmed
intellect. America's aggressiveness
and sense of hostility seems exag-
gerated within our own culture’,
not only with what is projected out
to the rest. of the world. I
The nature of our competitive
market system has changed more
toward greed, envy, contempt,
hatred and alienation, all of which
operate to pull us apart. The preoc-
cupation. of "beating the system”
boils down to beating each other.
Much of the cultivation of human
compassion and expression of love
has been debased by the competi-
tive fervor and criteria imposed
with the expanse of materialism.
An attempt by America to realize
real world peace would be to slow
down her economic pace by modi-
fying the relationship between
profit and her use of world resour-
ces. Those having the greatest
capacity to do so are the wealthiest
people in this country. These peo-
ple must be made to assume that
they have the greatest ability to

The Inside Story

_I,’age.8.— I ‘ 1 



George Gatewood  

The fame received for projects at
Allegheny Observatory has been
mostly fame on promise, according
to George Gatewood, director of
Allegheny Observatory.

“You see, we haven’t done all that
much yet, but it looks as though we
might. So people are interested in
what we may do.” .

Of course, one of the things that

Gatewood and his crew may do is
either confirm the existence of, or
the impossibility of, a planet circling
Barnard’s Star.
' Barnard’s Star is the fourth near-
est star -to the “sun, and the star
closest to us with the largest proper
motion across the sky.

Proper motion is the actual move-
ment of objects that can be tracked
across the sky. Stars with the larg-
est proper motion are used in the
search for other planets since they
are the closest to us, and therefore
any wobble in their motion caused
by the gravitational pull of planets

on them would be the largest for_

which scientists could hope.

Peter van de Kamp of Sproul Uni-
versity studied observations of Bar-
nard’s Star taken since 1937, and in

. 1962 he announced that he had dis-

covered a wobble in the star’s

. proper motion.

The wobble, according to van de
Kamp, indicated the presence of a
planet the size of Jupiter. He later

I “ reported that there was the possibil-

ity of two planets circling the star.

Gatewood, however, has been
studying the proper motion of Bar-
nard’s Star off -and on for the last ten
years. He and his mentor, Heinrich
Eichhorn, of the University of Flor-

. ida at Gainesville, believe that their

study of Barnard’s Star shows that
the possibility of planets the size of
Jupiter circling the star are dim. -

It was found, in a study of the
Sproul Observatory photographic
plates, that the current wobble may
have increased significantly with the
remounting of a lens in 1949.

When Gatewood arrived at Pitt in‘

.1970, he came with a dissertation
already tucked under his arm. The
dissertation he was carrying was a

compilation of distances to the

stars, to be named a Standard

~Regional Praesepe Calibration

Catalogue.

This catalogue, said Gatewood,
had proved to him the superiority of
the 30-inch Thaw Memorial Tele-
scope at Allegheny Observatory.

He found while working on the
dissertation that all telescopes
except the Thaw had calibration

defects that affected the outcome of _

the data on star distances.

“I couldn't find any of those errors
in the Thaw,” said Gatewood.

“The reason for that, the reason

~ the Thaw is so remarkable, l found

out, is because the guy who made
the telescope wanted to be sure that
these errors not be present, and he
designed it that way.” ’

The Thaw telescope was
designed by the master lensmaker
of his day, and former acting direc-
tor of the observatory, John Bra-
shear. The Thaw was dedicated to
the memories of 'William Thaw and.
his son at the observatory’s open-
ing in 1912. ~ -

Unfortunately, the lens of the
Thaw will shortly be replaced,
although the work it does is still
excellent.

.“The only reason to replace the
lens on this one is the poor quality of
glass in those days. lt Brashear
could have gotten the quality of
glass we can get today, there
wouldn't be any reason to replace
that one," said Gatewood.

Gatewood began to study Bar-

Bamard’s Star: The Yearly Means of Three Te

lescopes and The Proposed Orbit.»The

arrows indicate the discrepancy between Gatewood’s data and that collected by van

de Kamp.

nard’s Star in 1972, after his col-
leagues at the university persuaded
him to have a look at what they'd
found.

Nicholas Wagman, then director
of the observatory, had begun the
initial studies of Barnard’s Star

‘shortly after van de Kamp postu- I

lated the existence of planets in
‘1962. .

“I didn’t come here to study this

\

“The possibility is there in

. that it could have some-

thing to do with planetary
motion. And in fact, there
is some tendency to see
some repetition further
back, of the same motion. ”

star, but it’s begun to look that way.
After I’d been here a while the fellow
who had done the initial study, and
didn’t see a planet, said he thought I
should look at this.

“I said .‘no,’ and after a while I saw
him again, and still he insisted I
should look at this.” Finallypnder
the off-beat and mild threat of not.

graduating, Gatewood consented to 7

look at Barnard’s Star.

And he's been looking ever since.

The answer as to whether‘ two
large planets are circling Barnard’s
Star is still “no", he said.

He finds that generally the data
collected from the Thaw telescope
doesn’t show a wobble anywhere
near that of van de Kamp’s theories.

There is, however, evidence of a A
slight wobble. ‘

“There is some evidence there for

something that doesn’t look at all *

like the line van de Kamp draws. I'm
not at all prepared to go out on a
limb. I’ll ,wait till the M.A.P. gets on
line and I can take a closer look,”
said Gatewood.

The M.A.P. is the Multi-channel
Astrometric Photometer with which
the observatory is currently experi-
menting. By counting the number of
photons emitted from a star, 

’ \

M.A.P. can provide accurate data
about the characteristics of the star.
What Gatewood. sees in .the
charts on Barnard’s Star is a dip
where the Allegheny Observatory
data goes down, and van de Kamp’s
proposed line goes up.
“That's very accurate data right
there. The error on that is only
about a third of the distance
— (between 0 and +10 on the chart),”
said Gatewood. He believes it’s
suprising that the Thaw data could
go that far down.

“What's more interesting, how-
ever, is that both the Naval Obser-
vatory telescope and the Thaw
show that same drop at the same
time. i \

“The possibility is there that it
could have something to do with
planetary motion. And in fact, there
is some tendency to see some repe-
tion further back, of the same
motion.

“In which case, we're talking
about something on the order of 11
years or so in an orbital period,” he
said.

Which would -nean that any
planet would be a very small one,
“srraller than Jupiter by a good bit.”

However, he hasn't yet gone forth.

and made an announcement to the
a world.

“There's just not enough stuff
there to prove it. What I like to say is
that we certainly haven’t proven

there are no planets there. What we ’

have said is that’ it’s not the one
suggested,” he said.‘

According to Gatewood, a study
of whether a number of planets
revolves around Barnard_’s Star ‘has
to consider many things.

One of the most important of
these is. the/fact that an observer
watches the star from a moving plat-
form, Earth.

“As we go round the sun looking
at the star, we're shifting back and
forth quite a good distance in
spac_e-93 million miles either way,”

' and this makes the star look like it’s

moving back and forth.

“That’s how we determine the dis-
tance of the star. If it’s nearby it
oscillates farther. The effect is kind
of like the telephone poles near the
car swish by faster than the“moun—
tains in the distance. It’s the same
effect as parallax,” he explained.

“We have to remove that effect,”
he added.

Another effect which must also be
taken into account is the star’s own
motion through space. Barnard’s
Star has more motion than any

other star in the sky, at 10 arc
seconds per year.

Arc seconds are a form of meas-

urement based on the circle. Ev ~ .

circle has 360 degrees, and eac
degree is divided again into 60 min-
utes of arc. Each arc minute is again
divided into 60 seconds of arc. This
is an indication of how exact the
science of astronomy can be.

1 “Also we have to allow for the fact
that the star is getting closer to us

. while it moves this way. lt’s rather as

if somebody threw a ball at you from
the distance. You’d swear the ball
was going to hit you, but as it gets
closer you realize that it’s just going

- to miss.

“As it gets closer ‘and closer you

C see it swish by. That swish-by effeci ._
. is what we call secular accele“ 

tion,” said Gatewood. ~\ .

Barnard’s Star is moving toward ’
us, too.

“lt’s changing its apparent
upwards motion as it gets closer,
and we can see now, very clearly, it’s
going to swing by. That acceleration
of the proper motionhas to be taken
out.”

Once all these are removed,
Gatewood said, then the residuals
can be charted and studied.

The newest chart for Barnard’s
Star shows the residuals in a thou-
sandths of an are second.

“That’s where you have to look 

see if you can see the effect-of a
planet’s gravitation on the star,”
said Gatewood.

The chart of the observatory’s
recent study of the star has a plot of
the residuals of ten-thousandths of
an are second, from O to +10 and
from 0 to -10 on the chart.

“Any error is usually about five-
thousandths of an are second. The
line drawn is the orbit as proposed
by van de Kamp. The dots are aver-
ages for each year the star was

observed from three different tele-
.-scopes,” hesaid.

The three telescopes used in_
study were the Thaw telescope t
Allegheny Observatory, the Van
Flick telescope in California and the
United States Naval Observatory‘
telescope.

“My contention is,” said Gate-
wood, “that the dots do not suggest
the line. There isn’t a planet the size
of ‘Jupiter orbiting about Barnard’s
Star.” . '

within a major city in the United
States. Completed in 1912, Allegh-,
eny Observatory stands on a hill
overlooking, in the distan_ce,_the city
of Pittsburgh.

umor has it that the observatory

, R
i  created on the tail of the bright

comet of 1859: Excited by the
resurging new interest in astron-
omy, a group of Pittsburgh busi-
nessmen, a Carnegie, Frick and
Mellon among them, formed The
Allegheny Telescope Association
and purchased a thirteen-inch
retracting telescope-

Nothing indicated that this group,
which met after dark in the city of
Allegheny (now Pittsburgh’s North
Side), would grow into an interna-
tionally known institution. After the

. installation of the much awaited tele-

0.-is

scope. in 1861, it would lie virtually

' unused for the next six years.

In 1867, the association donated
the telescope and its building to the
Western University of Pennsylva-
a (later to become the University
of Pittsburgh), and the first astrono-
mer, Samuel Pierpont Langley, was
hired by the university as professor
of astronomy and director of Allegh-
eny Observatory.

Ten years later, Langley would be

i called away to Washington, D.C. to

take charge of the Smithsonian
Institute, the highest scientiﬁc office
in the nation.

During the time he was in Pitts-
burgh, however, Langley wasted no
time. He turned his passion for
science into discovery and inven-
tion. He adapted photographic
plates to the telescope in order to
photograph the stars, and in the end

, developed a small transit tele-

e to observe the positions of
stars crossing the celestial meridian,
and was the first man on earth to
obtain accurate time.

In addition, Langley pioneered
the study of the sun and discovered

. that the dark radiations given off by

  
 

the sun were necessary to life. He
invented the bolometer, an instru-
ment to detect heat from different

parts of the sun’s spectrum. Eventu- _

ally his theories on solar pheno-
mena became the basis for
contemporary solar study. -

It was while in Pittsburgh that
Langley met John A. Brashear, a
millworker who, as a hobby, ground

ad ground. Impressed, Langley
introduced Brashear to William
Thaw, who eventually ﬁnanced a
shop for Brashear to work full time
grinding lenses. 1

Brashear soon became the most
famous lensmaker of his day. When
the Thaw Memorial Telescope was
finished in 1912, Brashear had
designed the lens especially for pho-
tographic use.

The Thaw Refractor Telescope
still stands today in use at Allegheny

iObservatory. It is the third largest

refractor in the United States today.

In 1891,_ James Edward Keeler
joined the Allegheny Observatory
as Langley’s replacement. As direc-
tor, he used the original thirteen-
inch telescope to make spectros-
copic studies of the rings of Saturn,
discovering that the rings, contrary
to the belief at the time, were not
solid but rather composed of mil-
lions of tiny particles.

Outdated equipment and the
increasing pollution of Pittsburgh’s
industry’ began to obstruct the
pbservatory’s work. - .

With the help of Brashear, Keeler
drew up plans for a new sigtf in

Riverview Park. In'1898, however, ._

Keeler left for the directorship of the
Lick Observatory in California.

Keeler died in.1900 in California.
In 1906, his ashes were placed in the
crypt that was built for him beneath
the Keeler Memorial Telescope of
the new Allegheny Observatory in
Riverview Park. He was later to be
joined by his son, as well as the
ashes of Brashear and his wife,
Phoebe.

The next director of the observa-
tory was to serve from 1900 to 1912.
F.L.O. Wadsworth came to Pitts-
burgh from Yerkes Observatory.
He spent most of his directorship
overseeing the building of the new
observatory.

Another Yerkes astronomer fol-
lowed Wadsworth to Pittsburgh to
pick up the directorship. It was while
at Allegheny that Dr. Frank Schle-

singer completed the work he had I

begun at Yerkes.

His studies of parallax methods——
techniques for measuring the dis-
tances to the stars——established him
as the father of the science. He
stayed 14 years, until 1920, when he
left to become director of the obser-
vatory at Yale.

Heber D. Curtis began at Lick
Observatory in California. He
became director of the Allegheny
Observatory after Schlesinger. As
director, he improved the machin-
ery and constructed precision
instruments. He left Allegheny
Observatory in 1930 to become
director of the observatories at the
University of Michigan. .

In the years since 1930’, many ‘no-
table scientists have been asociated
with the observatory. These
include, among others, F.W. Very,
R.J. Trumpler, Zaccheus_ Daniel,
Kelvin Burns, Frank Jordan, NE.
Wagman, director and discoverer of
three binary stars by use of photo-
graphic equipment, and originator’
of the preliminary studies on Bar-
nard’s Star undertaken at the obser-
vatory, and J .H. Kiewiet de Jonge,
acting director of the observatory
from 1970 until 1977.

I ¥l'r*iie,i>iu News, Wednesdal’ I “W; 9.1982  

Nestled in the hills of Pittsburgh’s
North Side lies one of the major
astronomical research observato-
ries in the world, according -‘to
George Gatewood, director of
Allegheny Observatory and asso-
ciate professor of physics and
astronomy at the University of
Pittsburgh.

Over the years since the observa-
tory was first donated to the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh, it has often led the
way in the field of astrometry—the
study of the positions of stars and
their apparent motions across the
sky.

Two areas in which-the observa-

tory has been particularly success- ’

ful, according to Gatewood, have
' been the determinationof interstel-
lar distances by parallax and the

_ search for other planets.
“Allegheny Observatory has’

determined the distances to more
stars than any"other observatory in
the world,” Gatewood said. ‘He esti-
rnated the total to beabout2,500 in
a I. '

As a result, other observatories
calibrate, or standardize, their mea-
surements of star distance to those
of Allegheny Observatory.

“They calibrate to us because no
other single observatoryhas done
this many nor this wide a range of

star types. We’ve done everytype of.

star you can see, practically,” Gate-
wood said. _
The observatory has also mea-

sured the distances to more binary,
...star systems than anyone else,

according to Gatewood. Binary sys-
tems are pairs of stars that revolve
around each other.

By measuring the distance to a
binary star system, it is possible to
“determine the mass of the two
stars. And knowing the mass of the
star, knowing its distance, you can
now calibrate some absolute cha-

racteristics about it,” he explained.

One such characteristic is the
amount of. energy developed per
gram of mass inside the star.
According to Gatewood, this “gives
you some idea about the astrophys-
ics and all the ‘fusion-type things
going on. It’s very basic to our
understanding of energy itself.”

Another research project at the
observatory is the search for plane-
tary systems—a project into which
Gatewood admits to having been
drawn by the National Aeronautics
Space Administration. - '

“The possibility of life in the uni-
verse is a very stimulating concept,
although it kind of leaves you empty
when" you talk about it. You just
don’t know what to say. ,

“The parameters that are

 :.3.e'.

unknown are many, and they’re_

. very unknown. In other words, you

don’t know how many planetary
systems there are in the universe,
you don’t know how many of those
planetary systems have earths, you
don’t know how many have evolved
intelligent life,” Gatewood’
explained. _

Gatewood believes his contribu-‘
tion to astronomy lies in the detec-
tio'n of the planetary systems in the
universe, a contribution he believes
to be significant in itself, apart from
the question of whether there is life

elsewhere in the universe.

“I prefer to look at it as real estate.
If there’s nobody there, that’s all the
better," said Gatewood.

But the existence ofplanets out-

7 side. our solar system may present

man with an opportunity for inter-
stellar travel. Gatewood doesn’t

know if mankind will ever be able to ‘

leave this solar system for another,
but he suspects he will. .

“Knowing that there’s a possibil-
ity at the next star is going to be a
little incentive. It’s going to make
humanity anxious.‘ Humanity has
never failed at something it’s gotten
into its mind it’s wanted to do.
That’s our species. ‘Give us a chal-
lenge and we’ll usually rise to it,”
Gatewood said. ,

The question of incentive aside,
however, the discovery of other

, planetary systems will -teach us

about our own, according to
Gatewood. .
“If they are there, how, do they

differ from our own planetary sys-

tem? Do they have giant planets like
Jupiter and Saturn? If they do, do
those planets usually lie way out in
the solar system like they do in our
own? Is that a general characteristic
or is there something peculiar about
our planetary system that made that
happen? .
“Immediately, by comparison,’
you can learn many things. It’s a lot
of good science, whether the ques-

_ tion of life is ever solved,” Gatewood

said.

One important issue, according
to Gatewood, is that of the forma-
tion of planetary systems from the
residue of stellar births, “the leftov-
ers of the sun coming into being and
forming planets. If stars form the
way we think they do, then plane-
tary systems are almost a natural
leftover.” j ‘

Planetary systems would then be
plentiful in the universe. But if the
opposite were true, planetary sys-
tems would be scarce.

“One of the early things we did

to question whether or not planets
can exist around binary stars,” he
said.

These binary systems are com-
mon, so common, Gatewood said,
that “we’re having a hard time find-
ing other single stars (like the sun).”

In an effort to aid its ﬁearch for

 other planetary systems, the obser- '

vatory recently moved into elec-
tronics, with the Multi-channel
Astrometric Photometer (MAP)———a.
device developed and built by the
observatory staff.

With the M.A.P., researchers at
the observatory can measure the
apparent brightness of many stars
at once through the same telescope.

-According to Gatewood, the M.A.P.

collects about one in every ten
photons—the bundles of energy
given off by light-—from each of the
stars studied.

“That in itself isn’t too exciting,"
but what we do is modulate the ‘

brightness. We vary the bright-

Brightness is varied by passing"
the stars behind a large piece of
glass on which there are thousands
of lines etched. The lines are separ-
ated by about a quarter of a millime-

ter from center to center, according. .

to Gatewood. .
“As those lines move by the stars,
their size, their diameter is such that

they block the starlight out. When ‘ l

the star moves further over with
respect to the rulings, it slides by,
the light will shine through between
two lines- The star brightens up,
darkens out. That’s what we mean
by modulation,” Gatewood

V explained. .

“This modulated effect gives you

a wavy pattern. The stars will not all 

appear to be moving in unison.
Some will be getting brighter while
some will be getting fainter. That’s
exactly what I’m looking for-the

position and separation of stars in ,

the field of the—telescope.”

- The next step is, according to
Gatewood, “just what we’d do with
a photographic plate. Then we’d

measure the distance between two ‘

stars.” _

This isn’t a new concept, he said,
but rather, a new way of doing an old
job, and doing it much more
accurately. .

“The standard deviation of error

associated with one of these plates ‘

is five-thousandths of an are second.
That’s for a whole year. With-the
M.A.P., we can look at theistar for
one hour and have less error_—~
about three-thousandths of an are
second. You can do in one hour with
this telescope what you could do
before in an entire year.”

Swimmers Preparing For

By BRIAN BALK

Fred Lewis, coachof the Panther
men’s swimming team, recapped

his 2-3 season in a paradoxical

manner, by saying, “It was the
worst season with the best
swimmers.”

This statement, at first glance, is

bewildering, however, when exam»

ined more carefully, it is quite logi-
cal. The key word is “swimmers”-—
nd last season’s swimmers were
the best ever. _
Then why the losing record?

player, save those who are ‘the
objects of the attempts at

Thus, each opponent will
play with more-than-normal,
intensity because an upset Ca'f1""’

Safety Tom Flynn explained
this theory,_ saying, they'll all be
after us, because they know we
are out to step on a lot of toes.”

P For a No. -l team, every game
is ‘regarded as crucial to its
standing. But for a team strug-
gling.with a losing record, the

Unfortunately, for the Panthers’
sake, competitive collegiate swim-
ming includes an event that does
not measure the velocity of strokes.
It is the high fl ying, precision sport
of diving. And the absence of divers
was the missing iink to a successful
season.

-“After our divers quit, we just
couldn’t make up the deficit in
meets,” explained Lewis. A great

fallacy in the sport is that the ‘

swimmers can dive, and divers can
swim-—just like switching from
offense to defense in football.

only important game is the one
against a top seated adversary.

An example of this last year
was when Pitt played Boston
College. The Panthers thought
they would be able to sit back

and relax against the Eagles, a P

respectable team, ‘but certainly
not in the same league with
Pitt. The Panthers were
astounded when an aggressive
Eagle squad led going into the
fourth quarter. . “

This is anything but the truth,

ing, except that both involve
splashing into water.

Last season's Panther swimmers
had to spot opposing teams valua-

divers. Thus, two of the team’s out-
standing swimmers, Sandy Pid-
geon and! Rick Carter well called
upon to reel in much of the slack.

Both being seniors, Pidgeon and
Carter were well versed in all areas
of competitive swimming and their

‘experience helped in many ways.

with ..,an L undefeated record.
Take, for instance, last year’s
No. l.team, Clemson.

Granted they went unde-
feated (11-0) but some some of
their victories were against
teams that just barely met the
requirements for a Division I
school.

These teams with rather ele-

“Rick could come in and win
virtually any event he would swim
in,” said Lewis. “Sandy was very
versatile, just his name alone was
an intimidator.

“But both really cared—they
were willing to sacrifice their own
gain so that the team could win.
“Both will be missed.”

Not only will Pidgeon and Car-
ter’s bodies be absent next fall, but
so will their patented “workhorse”
training techniques at the daily
practices. ’

“Carter, who isn’t a distance

man, swam 4:42 in the 500-freestyle.

in November. He is an extremely

. hard worker, and it carried over in

all the events he swam,” said
Lewis. ,

Lewis lables Pidgeon an
:‘animal" when it comes to train-
mg, saying that a hoist and crane
could not pull him away from
extra practice time." ’

Lewis has signed a top-notch
recruit, Donald Martian,» in an
attempt to replace Pidgeon. Mar-
tian, from New Jersey, was one of
the fastest high school swimmers
in the country.

“He was a senior qualifier in the
200-yard breaststroke, and swam a
9:31 in the 1000-freestyle,” said
Lewis. That is 10 seconds faster
than anyone presently on our
team." - E

Lewis explained that Martian
chose Pitt because of its Engineer-
ing program and because of the
excellent talent like Pidgeon that

" has filtered through the swim team?

over recent years.

To compensate for the diving
deficiency, Coach Julian, Krug has
recruited six divers, saying, “it
takes a lot of time to develop divers.
The more divers you have to work
w1th,.the greater your advantage.”
_ Neither Lewis nor Krug are tak-
mg any chances on next year, for
they have both discovered that
there is safety in numbers.

mentary schedules seem to
sneak up slowly then crack the
top five, sneaking closer to the
top each reach. For example,
picture this scenario: »

The Panthers are ranked.first,
and are scheduled to meet Jerry
Faust’s legendary Notre Dame
squad, while No. 2 ranked
team, say a Clemson or a South
Mississippi, 8-0 and ranked
second only because they are the
only other undefeated team in
the nation, will meet Rice.

On whom is the pressure on?’

One other obstacle is main-
taining a confident, winning
attitude all season.long, and area
in which the Panthers may have
the most difficulty.

They have the talent——there
is no doubt about that-—-but

who will take the place of the 

team’s spiritual leader Sal Sun-
seri? Is there any other Panther
who has atained the respect,
and who has the leadership
qualities to get mentally pre-
pared for every game? i

It is hard for a player to relate
to a coach’s pep talk, they need a
fellow teammate who faces the
same hardships and disciplines ,
to fully arouse their drive to
win.

There are many other obsta-
cles that the Panthers must
endure to assure that their
climb to the top is a successful
and stable one.

When a team is at the bottom
there is nowhere to go but up.
However, when a team is at the

s top, it is another story.

  pcoming Season

counting heavily next season is
backstroker Ed Bergden. ‘

Lewis said; “I wasn’t really
pleased with Ed in the- 200-
backstroke. He has to increase his"
intensity. But Ed has All-America‘
capabilities in both 100 and 200-
yard breaststroke events.” S ,

Lewis can also see the potential
in many of his swimmers, such as
Ed LaNoue. “Ed La Noue's limits
are the ones that he sets for himself.
He has all the talent to be great—he
will take himself only as far as he
wants to go,” Lewis emphasized.

Three swimmers with whom
Lewis has been especially pleased
in summer practice are _].D.
McCrillis, Jerry Zaleski and Jeff
Emore.

“They are all looking for their
best years ever, and they have
earned it,” Lewis said. ‘

The new, strategy that Lewis
hopes to employ for next season
calls for a sweeep of the firstfew
events. ‘ » *

“We'll be working on the first
part of the meets,” he said. “If we
can win them, then we'll have the
momentum behind us and we
won't have to rely on diving.”

Cranking out 19 to 20 thousand
miles each day is a tireome chore
made even more difficult without
competition as a motivating force.
The question is, where does the
Panther swim team obtain its moti-
vation for the grueling summer
months?

According to Lewis, the thought
of recapturing the Eastern Title
trouncing rival West Virginia and
regaining an overall “pride” in
Panther swimming is more than
enough to “keep them toiling
away.”

For most of us, swimming is a
relaxing way to cool off during the
scorching summer months, but for
Lewis and the Panther squad,
summer swimming is anything but
cooling.

Major League Baseball Season Shaping Into Form

By KEVIN TURRENTINE

Major league baseball slid down
through the first third of the sea-
son, or it has two thirds remaining.
It all depends for which team
you're rooting.

Already, the common patterns of
America’s pastime have fallen into
place. ' I I

George Steinbrenner is still up to
his old tricks, division races are
beginning to form, Gaylord Perry
is still throwing his “spitter” and
the Chicago Cubs and Minnesota
Twins remain the worst teams in
the game.

The big news in the baseball
world is the division races. New
faces speckle the front runners in
the standings. In the American
League, it’s the Boston Red Sox
and the K.C. Royals. And in the
National League, it’s the St. Louis
Cardinals and the Atlanta Braves.

started the season in typical Yankee
fashion. One manager, Dick‘
Howser, has already been fired and

several players have also removed
the pinstripes. But King George
has restocked the Bronx Zoo with
other familiar over-paid players.
After 55 games, the Yankees have
used the same line-up only seven
times, including four different first
basemen in one week.

The Yankees give a new rﬁ‘&“-'
ing to the phrase, “who's on first?”
By the end of the first week, the
Yankees spinning—door policy may
spit out yet another former all-star.

It’s become a struggle as to who
will last longer——Jim Palmer or
Earl Weaver. Weaver, the Oriole
skipper, has sworn to make this
season his last, but the Orioles have
been losing lately and Weaver may
not last through the season.

Meanwhile, Weaver's ace
pitcher, Jim Palmer, has requested
that the Orioles trade him. And
although his cries aren't so loud in
Baltimore, ’ the Yankees have
offered a hanky to soak up some of
the tears. '*- 5

Carl Yastrzemski must have
passed around the bottle of Geritol
to his teammates. The Red Sox
have jumped out to their best since
1978. Yaz, Jim Rice, Dwight Evans
and company have been hanging
balls off the Green Monster (the
nickname of the wall in Fenway
Park) all year.

That, along with crack pitching
staff lead by Dennis Eckersley has
propelled the Bosox into first
place, and has_ given the Bean-
Town fans reason to cheer.

The Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde of.

this season has to be the Cleveland
Indians. With the league’s leading
slugger, Tobby I-Iarrah, and the
major league RBI leader, Andre

Thornton, the tribe has shifted imf‘

high gear and are gaining an the
division leaders.

The Indians spent the end of
May and the first week of June win-
ning, reeling off an 11 game win
streak, the longest in the American
League this season.

Usually at this point in the sea-
son, the Toronto Blue Jays are 20
games outof first place, searching
for a new manager, and asking why
they ever started a franchise.

This year has been different for
the surprising Blue jays. Believe it
or not, they can actually challenge
for first place in the American
League east since they're only 91/2
games out.

With a substantial winning
streak, the Blue jays could be in the
division race come September.

The Detroit Tigers have
Motown in a spin. The young Ti’-
gers are just one and one~half
games out of first place, and it
looks like they will remain con-
t _ “s for the rest of the season.

Sparky Anderson has their bats
ripping balls into the upper decks
of Tiger Stadium. Larry Herndon,
usually a clutch hitter without
much power laced four consecutive
homeruns ' into the left field
bleachers in a two game span this
season. Tough man Kirk Gibson,
along with help from Lance Par-
rish, Mike Ivie and the rest of the
Tigers may bring the pennant back
to Motown for the first time since
1968.

The Milwaukee Brewers have
pulled out of an early-season tail
spin to jump back in the Eastern
Division race. Manager'Buck Rog-
er " 3 been fired, leaving the team
in the hands of interim manager
Harvey Kuenn.

The Brewers responded by salut-
ing Mr. Kuenn with the long ball.
In an eight-day span, the Brewers
hit back-to-back-to-back home-
runs on two different occasions. In
addition, they hit back-to-back
homeruns twice. Opposing teams
are dropping like flies, while
opposing pitchers’ E.R.A.'s are
soaring. No wonder Milwaukee

the Yankees was a record for runs
scored by a team in any game this
year. And no one enjoyed the game
more than ex-Yankee manager
turned Royal manager Dick
Howser. Revenge is sweet slid right
now. so are are the Royals.

It seems that this is the year for
revenge. When former Yankee
Reggie Jackson made his first
return appearance to Yankee sta-
dium earlier this year, he smashed a
seventh-inning homerun, much to
the delight of the Angels, the Yan-
kee fans and some other Yankee
partisans scattered throughout the
country. But Reggie, and the all-
star filled California Angel line-up
are suffering their first losing
streak of the season.

The Angels lost eight consecu-
tive games, and with the price
they're paid to try and win it all this

.-season, no rebate will be offered.

"Going into June, the Angels had
the lowest team E.R.A. and the
second highest slugging percen-
tage, but now the Angels can’t
score runs.

Sporting their new uniforms the
Chicago White Sox took to the
field and ran to an early divisional
lead. But that ended soon.

Chicago dropped seven straight
games, as well as the division lead.
After Lamar Hoyt sprang out to a
9-0 record, it was downhill for the
Chisox. Hoyt, now 9-2, was the
first sign of bad times in the South
Side of Chicago, and Ron
LeFlore’s slump further added to
the woes.

When the Chisox begin winning
again, Chicago will be rocking
again, or Bill Veeck isn’t
imaginative.

What ever became of Billy Ball?
The Oakland Athletics (as they
preferred to be called this year)

Brock’s record, but Oakland is well
on its way down to the basement of
the American League West. Not
even Billy's tantrums will save
them. .K

The Texas Rangers have added
new meaning to the word futility.
The Rangers suffered a 12-game
losing streak and took their annual

place neat the basement of the I

American League West. Star
catcher Jim Sundberg came to the
plate 20 times during a one-week
span and collected only two hits.
And he was the hottest hitter on the
team.

The Ranger players wore bags
over their heads in the dugout dur-
ing their losing streak, which
prompted Ranger manager Don
Zimmer to ask, “who are those
masked men?” Texans really don’t
want to know.

How do you encore a season
opening l3-game win streak, the
longest at the start of any baseball
season?

With a pennant, that's how. And
the Atlanta Braves are trying to do
just ‘that. New manager Joe Torre
has kept Atlanta hot all season.
The Braves started the season with-
out their ace pitcher Phil Niekro,
but found ways to win with the bat.

Homerun leader Dale Murphy is
the link to the new and improved
“murderer‘s row." The Braves’
lineup is stocked with long ball
threats Claudell Washington, Dale
Murphy, Bob Homer and Chris
Chambliss.

And for a young team, the Braves
have kept their composure in tight
games, coming from behind in
more than half of their games.

The Cinderella team of the
National League is the San Diego
Padres. The common term year-in
and year-out for the Padres is “they
haven't got a prayer," but this year
they’ve got a line-up full of stars,
led by Ruppert Jones.

should easily eclipse Lou‘

Jones’ hitting has sparked the
new and improved Padres, and the
sharp fielding of Gary Templeton
has helped some of the great pitch-
ing performances from the Padres
hurlers.

Newly-found pitching ace Tim

Lollar has ‘kept’ enemy batters c

handcuffed all season. And the
Padres are heading right to the top
of the division.

Los Angeles Dodgers manager
Tommy Lasorda once said that if
you could cut him he'd bleed
Dodger blue. The Dodger fans may
take him up on that offer soon, as
the .500 Dodgers have the city in an
uproar. Pitchers Bob Welch, Jerry
Reuss and the rest of the Dodger
dart throwers are suffering from
the basehit blues.

Dusty Baker and Pedro Guerrero
are off to their best starts ever at the
plate, but all of the other sluggers
are slumping. Steve Garvey, who
recently played in his l00Oth con-
secutive game, is showing signs of
regaining his all-star swing.

When the talent-laden Dodgers
put it all together, whichthey even-
tually will, Los Angeles will be

ments will be taken figuratively.
Candlestick Park has housed
some great teams in the past, but
not this year. The Giants are doing
what is expected of them, losing
and keeping out of the basement.
jack Clark andjoe Morgan-are
beginning to hit, but the remainer
of the team is struggling. The
Giants have yet to prove that they
have a pitching staff, and they may
soon find themselves in the cellar
of the National League West.
The Houston Astrodome has

always been a pitcher’s ballpark.

Unfortunately for the Astros, their
pitchers are slumping. The Astros
over-loaded their bullpen a year
ago with baseball's best hurling,
but age has cast an ugly shadow in
Houston.

Manager Bill Virdon is walking
a fine line between being fired or
retained as a coach. And the all-
time walk king, Nolan Ryan, is
suffering through an uncharacter-
istically poor season.

The Big Red Machine has turned
out to be a tinker toy this season.

Baseball, Season Underway

continued from pagggthirteen

After some off-season trades that
left the Reds as defenseless as the
Argentinian army, their fans have
decided to abandon ship. Gone are
George Foster, Ken Griffey and

Dave Collins, as well as the stellar ‘

pitching performances of Tom
“Terrific” Seaver, who is 1-7 thus
far.

Dan Driessen is the new star
amidst the red galaxy, but without
a supporting cast the Reds stand
little chance of finishing as high in
the division as they have in recent
years.

The only link between Cincin-
nati and the former Big Red
Machine is a rusty old Johnny
Bench.

The most exciting pennant race
is the National League East. The
team to beat thus far has been the
St. Louis Cardinals. Although
bullpen ace Bruce Sutter; has fal-

tered, the rest of the Cardinal pitch-

ing staff has performed well.

As usual, the Cards are stacked
with hitters. Shortstop Ozzie
Smith, acquired from San Diego
during the off season, has been a
wizard at the plate as well as in the
field. Outfielder George Hendrick
and all-star first-baseman Keith
Hernandez have been burning uo
the league with their hitting. The
Cards figure to be in the race until
September, and after that it's every
team for itself.

After coming ever so close to the
National League championship
game last year, the Montreal Expos
are back and hungrier than ever.
Catcher Gary Carter and outfielder
Warren Cromartie have slugged
the Expos into second place in the
National League East.

The Expos strung together an
eight game win streak in early
June, placing themdamong the div-

ision leaders.

Although Bill "Spaceman" Lee
has disappeared from the sport, the
Expos pitching staff is still able to

.entertain the fans at Olympic

Stadium.
Charlie Lea put together a span
of 27 shutout innings and Scott
Sanderson lowered his E.R.A. to
1.91. No wonder Les Canadians are
singing cheerful tunes these days.
After struggling through the
first month of the season with Mike
Schmidt out with an injury, the
Phillies are back in the race.
Schmidt, who suffered a pulled
muscle in his rib cage, is back and
making up for lost time. New
shortstop Ivan Dejesus is making
everyone forget Larry Bowa. Newly
acquired catcher Bo Diaz is regu-
larly clouting pitches out of Vete-
ran Stadium.
Dick Ruthven has become one of
the Philly aces, along with Steve
Carlton, and reliever Tug McGraw

has been better in 7-Up commer-
cials than he has in the bullpen.

The Phillies are in good shape
for a mid-season rush that could
place them into first place in the
National League East. Maybe, that
will make up for the '76ers.

In I969 they called it a miracle.
Well, in I982 they should call it the
second coming. The New York
Metropolitans (better knows as the
i\’l(‘lS) are searching for their third
pennant.

Impossible, you say! Well look at
their line-up. Dave Kingman and
George Foster batting back to back.
Speedster Mookie Wilson leading
the league in base hits.» I

Impossible, you still say! Craig
Swann returning to old form on
the mound as well as Randy Jones,
a one-time Cy Young Award
winner, and top relief pitcher Neil
Allen who leads the Na_tional
League in saves with 14. '

Add to this a new manager,
George Bamburger, a new score-
board, and some new found fans
and you've got the new New York
Mets. Impossible, you still say!
Well—mavbe.

The Pirates have given the city of
Pittsburgh reason to yearn for the
coming of the football season.

After a horrendous start in which
the Pirates longest win streak was
two games, the Bucs seem to be
back in the groove. Tony Pena has
stepped forth as the late-inning
hero. and the Bucs are back on the
winning track. \ -
With a bull pen which had only
completed one game entering the
month of June, the Bucs found that
out-slugging their opponents was
the only solution. With that in
mind, they rose to the top of team
averages in the National League.
Omar Moreno became the league
leader in stolen bases and Jason

‘ Thompson has proven a candidate

for the Triple Crown. Although
Pops Stargell hasn't hit a homerun
since the seventh game of the '79
World Series, he still has the moti-
vation and leadership to help the

young Bucs. But if they don’t shapeggkﬂ

up on the mound, they won't be
worth a wooden nickle.

With only one third of the season
wrapped up, baseball has many
more thrills to offer. And whether
you're a Tiger fan ora Twin fan, or
31 Pirate fan, or a lowly Cub fan, at
least there's one good‘ thought to
keep in mind-the season’s made it
further this year than it did last
year.
