Evaluating the FAS

The provost's $1.4 million allocation and a 6 percent across-
the-board budget cut alleviated the I996 debt, but some
grad programs still face possible reduction or elimination.

the school’s dean has appointed a committee
to study individual departments for ways to
cut down the number of faculty members
and reduce the budget.

Peter Koehler, the FAS dean, has insti-
tuted a handful ofmeasures — including a 6
percent cut in every department —- to bring
the budget back into line after a $2.6 million
shortfall for ﬁscal year 1996.

expect the budget to be balanced next year.”

Abortion was thrust to the forefront _
of political agendas last Wednesday
with protestors citing the re-election of a
pro—choice president, his recent veto of
anti-abortion legislation, and the surge
of violence at abortion clinics as the rea-
son for their march.

Members of Pitt’s Students for Life,
in conjunction with College
Republicans and the Newman Oratory
Center, joined the protesters who flood-
ed the capital to hear speeches and then
participate in a march towards the
Supreme Court.

The protest commemorates the 24th
anniversary of Roe v. Wade, the
Supreme Court decision which legalized
a woman’s right to an abortion.

The demonstration began at noon,
where abortion opponents gathered in a
park to listen to speeches by Nellie

V The demonstration, which lasted

three hours, drew participants from all
' over the country. A variety of interests
were represented, including the Pro—Life
Alliance of Gays and Lesbians (PLA-
GAL), People Concerned for the
Unborn Child, church youth groups,
university “Students for Life” groups,
and a large number of mothers with their
children.

Veterans of the event noted that,
unlike in years past, the only group
absent from the demonstration was the
majority of pro—choice activists.

“I’ve been to many of these in the
past,” said Deacon Joseph Sioli, who
serves at the Newman Center and works
with Pitt’s Catholic Campus Ministry.
“l’ve never seen a year with so few pro-
choice advocates. Nor have I ever seen a
year with so many pro-life supporters. It
makes you hopeful.”

Many demonstrators said they were
prompted to attend the march because of

Gray, president of “The March for Life,”
and New Jersey Rep. Christopher
Smith.

After the speeches, the mass began

walking up Constitution Avenue
towards the Supreme Court and the
Capitol. The protesters carried a multi-
tude of signs, including several blown-

up pictures of a 21-week-old, aborted
fetus. As the group marched, many held
hands, sang religious hymns, and prayed
the rosary.

Monday, January 27, ‘I997

 

If computer problems kept you from tum-
ing in an assignment on time last week, you
weren’t alone. ‘

Hundreds of Pitt students were left out in
the cold when an unidentiﬁed software prob-
lem forced Computing and Information
Services to close all seven University comput-
ing labs for more than 17 hours last Wednesday.

According to CIS, the problem ﬁrst sur-
faced around noon on Wednesday.

“Servers just started crashing one after
another,” said David Schatz, director of
Ubiquitous Network Access. “It became neces-
sary to shut the whole system down and reboot
them in an orderly fashion.”

CIS was forced to shut down all seven
computing labs by 3:30 p.m. Wednesday. They
reopened brieﬂy at 6:30 p.m., but it became
apparent that the problem had not been
resolved. At that point, the labs were closed
again until 9 a.m. Thursday.

Meanwhile, system analysts worked
through the night to get the system back up and
running. CIS says the length of downtime was
a result of the time required to repair the Novell
Directory Service database. Since reopening,
there have been no reports of further problems.

Perhaps more troubling, though, is that
CIS still does not know what went wrong in the

ﬁrst place.

“Because this is so recent, we have not
been able to determine the speciﬁc event which
triggered the problem,” said Jinx Walton, direc-
tor of CIS Support Services.

“As expected, our staff continues to mon-
itor the situation closely, and once the speciﬁc
cause is determined, will take action to prevent
a reoccurrence,” she added.

Computing labs manager J eff Raymond
said the problem may be related to changes
made to the system over the holiday break, but
atthispoint,itisjusttooearlytotell.

He wants to reassure students, though, that
the chances of another shutdown are slim.

“Even if another problem occurs, another
shutdown is unlikely to be necessary,”

Raymond said. “It won’t happen again to this '

magnitude.”

This is not the ﬁrst time Pitt has experi-
enced computer problems. Back in September,
faculty and administration computers crashed
in a similar manner. That time, everything
except the computing labs was affected.

According to Schatz, who provides facul-
ty desktop access, CIS worked with Novell fol-
lowing the problems in September to imple-
ment several changes to Pitt’s system.

“Last week’s shutdown only affected the
seven lab servers,” Schatz said. “So the steps
taken in September seem to have worked This
problem appears to be different and separate.”

SGB announces town hall meeting

1 an Borofski

  

Almost every student on campus has at
least one complaint about our University. This
week, they will ﬁnally get the chance to voice
them.

At Wednesday’s student government
meeting, board member Marquette Bowman
announced SGB’s ﬁrst Town Hall Meeting,
scheduled for Tuesday night at 8:30 p.m. in the
William Pitt Union Assembly Room.

"Through the ‘Town Hall Meetings,’ we
hope to bridge the communication gap
between the students and the administration,”
he said.

Bowman came up with the idea for the

r meeting when he staged his own fonrm as a

candidate for Student Government Board last
November. Fifty students met with several
administrators to talk about what was happen-
ing on campus. When elected, Bowman
decided to make a move to have another meet-
rng.

Bowman plans to continue the Town Hall
Meetings every month, with this month’s
theme to be “Meet the 1997 Board.”

The meeting will begin with each board
member giving a brief personal statement and
announcing what each is currently working
on. The meeting will then move to a presenta-
tion by Bowman explaining the purpose of
Student Government Board.

Finally, the meeting will be open to the

- ﬂoor, and students will have two microphones

to ask questions and voice concems and com-
plaints.

Board member Christa Douaihy said she
feels Bowman has started an excellent system
to ﬁnd out what the student body wants and
where they see problems.

‘There would be no Student Government
Board if there was no student need. As a stu-
dent, I realize that everyone has some com-
plaints about Pitt, and it’s about time that we,
as students, had somewhere to voice them,”
she said.

After the meeting is over, Bowman said

theboardmemberswillwalk around the

Assembly Room for one-on-one questions.
“We want to meet as many of the students

’ as possible,” he said.

Alos at Wednesday’s meeting, board
member David Eisenberg armounced that the
SGB is trying to get two playing ﬁelds open
for use by only intramural and club sports.
There would also be facilities for the teams to
store their equipment. 3

“Intramural and club teams can’t host
home gamesbecause they have no ﬁeld, and

can’t ask for equipment if they have nowhere‘

to store it,” Eisenberg said. “The new ﬁelds
will eliminate these problems.”

The proposed location for the ﬁelds is
behind the OC Lot and the Cost Center, where
there is currently a large dirt parking lot. The
spot is adjacent to where the varsity baseball
team now plays.

“We’re not losing anything. We are only
gaining,” Eisenberg said.

The Student Government Board will hold
their regular weekly meeting on Wednesday
night at 9:30 p.m. in 639 Wrlliarn Pitt Union.
The meeting is open to the student body.

othervvise funded.

Koehler has also asked researchers to
help out by delaying the use of their “start-up
frmds.” When a new researcher arrives at Pitt,

the University gives him about $150,000 to

set up the lab. Koehler said that money was
enough to cover the needs of two or three
years of their research.

Most researchers get grants from outside
sources and can then save this money for
when they need it more. Koehler has asked
the faculty not to use this money if they
haven’t already, except in emergency cir-
cumstances.

Staff positions may also take a hit,
though mostly in the form of attrition.

“We’re not trying to lay olf anybody,”
said Koehler. “This is a non—ﬁlling of already
vacant positions, and transfers of people to
other departments if we have to eliminate

. positions.”

The FAS administration also discovered
more money from external research grants
than it originally. had expected Koehler said
that by cleaning up the exact amounts in
University accounts,» the deﬁcit was only
about $2 million, rather than $2.6 million.

Maher also mentioned a new accounting
system that is being tested and should help
identify budget problems before they arise.
According to Maher, Art Rarnicone, interim
vice—chancellor for ﬁnance, and his staff are
testing the computerized system, but full acti-
vation will take some time. '

“Once fully implemented, it will make it
much easier for us to ﬁnd out quickly if a unit
is o.ver-cormnitting its budget,” said Maher.

Predicting the bollom line

The FAS shortfall has been blamed for
many things, including a decline in retention
rates or an excess in faculty hiring, but the
budgeting process itself is a lengthy process.

Budget planning is done on a step-by-
step basis, according to Rarnicone.
Budgeting begins with the previous year’s
level as a base line, and then each school pro-
duces a list of priorities of what it wants to do
and projects the expense.

The University takes the projected
amount of funding ﬁorn the state, the amount
to be earned from tuition, and an assumption
ofatuitionraiseinordertocreateabaseline
budget The FAS had the same baseline bud-
get as last year and received the same
increase as every other school.

“The bottom line never looks like what
we want it to look like,” Rarnicone said.

‘‘That’s when we start tweaking [the bud-

gets], but we can’t tweak the state.”

The amount of state funding this year
was not what Pitt had hoped for. Pitt asked for
a 6 percent increase over last year’s level, but
only a 1 percent increase was approved in
order to ensure parity with other state—related
schools. Some of those appropriations were
line items that went to speciﬁc units, while
the rest of the money simply went into Pitt’s
general fund.

Once the state appropriation is set and
the base line created, individual schools
receive the numbers and begin a budgeting
process of their own, starting with hiring fac-

THE PITT NEWS ‘

ulty and setting salaries.

Faculty members sign a contract for
eight months at a time, according to
Rarnicone. '

“We know who’s here, and we project
salary [costs]. You pay certain faculty types
more because of market conditions,“
Rarnicone said ‘The $2.6 million shortfall
has nothing to do with a tuition shortfall.”

When the shortfall was armotmced in
November, oﬂicials blamed the difference
between expected tuition dollars and the actu-
alnumbersonfallingretumratesinthe
sophomore, junior, and senior classes.
Oﬂicials now say retention was not the prob-
lern. ~
According to Ramioone, project expens-
es are why Koehler could not get his budget
into line, and these expenses will force the
provost to underspend his budget Rarnicone
said the various schools are not subjected to
cost analysis — a comparison of how much
is spent to how much is earned Schools also
do not receive reports on their revenues, only
expenses.

According to ‘Maher, none of the other
schools are in ﬁnancial trouble this year.
“Everything else is on track,” he said

Faculty members have blamed budget
problems on excessive FAS hiring commit-
ments and policy decisions. FAS ofﬁcials
blame the short amount of time between the
beginning of the ﬁscal year in July and when
they were notiﬁed to cut the school’s base
payroll by $1.1 million in late June.

Maher said all schools received notiﬁca-
tion of the cuts at the same time and that only
FAS had problems.

“I think that the real problem was an
over-comrnitment that was made by the FAS
administration during the winter and spring
of last year,” said Maher.

Possible grad program culs

Pitt’s administration decided two years
ago that the FAS budget was not big enough
to handle the number of faculty positions in
the University. Koehler has established a new
committee to look into FAS graduate pro-
grams and see where cuts and changes can be
made to streamline their ﬁnances.

There are about 550 faculty members in
theFASthisyear,andtheprovosthassaid
that number needs to go down.

In April 1995, departments within the
FAS were sorted into six categories in a
“PhaseIl”reporLThereportwasdesignedto
help administrators improve undergraduate
and graduate education, meet a target faculty
size, and maintain a balanced budget over the
long term by deciding which programs had
“achieved a high level of quality and nation-
al prominence” (category one) and which
were to be eliminated (category six).

That plan was never fully implemented
and is being reevaluated now.

“Now the budgetary reality is diiferent
than it was in 1995,” Koehler said. “The
University gave raises this year.  The only
way to balance the budget for 1997 was to
take some money from existing positions,
which meant some people had to go.”

Maher agreed saying, ‘That plan was
not accepted at the time because it projected
a faculty larger than the budget would sup-
portlthinkthattlratis clearerthaneveratthe
moment.”

Koehler has appointed a faculty plan-
ning advisory comrnittee with six members
to evaluate the report and the size of current
FAS departments. Those members, John
Cooper, chemistry; Seymour Drescher, l1isto-
ry; David Gauthier, philosophy; Katheryn
Linduff, history of art and architecture;

Stephen Manuck, psychology; and Alberta
Sbragia, political science, will present a new
report to Koehler and Maher by March 1.

“The outlook for the future is that this
kind of reallocation is the state of the future,”
Koehler said

. As part of the Phase H re-evaluation, the
committee willbe looking at graduate pro-
grams across the board, according to
Koehler, and making recommendations
about the possible elimination or integration
of 1ow—enrollment programs like the foreign
language and literature departments.

“It is very likely that some [departments]
will not have PhD programs,” said Koehler.
“We-are not going to force any departments
to combine.” But he said that sorrre language

departments had already begun integration
talks

The heads of various departments, when
contacted, said they could not comment
because there were ongoing discussions.
They did say these talks should be concluded
in about a month.

Koehler said no undergraduate pro-
grams would be touched for a number of rea-
sons, including Pitt’s ﬁnancial support ﬁorn
the state and because some students’ choices
are limited ﬁnancially, and these students
need to have access to a variety of programs.

“VVrth graduate programs,” Koehler
said. “You really don’t need that same
breadth. We overproduce PhDs compared
with the number of positions available to
obtain.  There’s an overproduction of PhDs
across the country.”

By narrowing the number of depart-
ments otfering doctoral degrees, Koehler said
those that do would be strengthened.

“Are [graduates] competitive interna-
tionally? If not, we’re not really helping
them,” he said

IntheoriginalPhaselIdocurnent,cate-
gory four departments were stuck in 
being re—evaluated because they had substan-
tial master’s programs, but only small interest
in their PhD counterparts.

These departments initially included
classics, East Asian languages and literature
(which, according to the report, does not have
any graduate programs), French and Italian
languages and literature, Germanic lan-
guages and literature, Hispanic languages
and literature, linguistics, and Slavic lan-
guages and literature. The Hispanic depart-
ment was later moved into category two,
departments on the verge of excellence.

At this point, the future of the category
four departments is unclear.

The report slated geology and planetary
sciences, religious studies, sociology, and the-
ater arts as part of category ﬁve —— otherwise
known as “programs to be redu .”

The category six progranrs, slated for
elimination, were crystallography (a strictly
graduate program), communication science
and disorders, and the center for cultural
resource research. Only the center for cultur-
al resource research has actually been elimi-
nated

The new comrnittee’s report will be A

reviewed by Koehler and the provost before
any further cuts are made.

way to get input and suggestions.

‘The intent for us is to walk away from
here tonight,” said Harkins, “with ideas on
how to improve campus safety.”

The emphasis placed on area lighting
began in December of 1992 when a campus-
wide analysis found that Pitt lacked in the
area of campus transportation. The evalua-

‘ tion went on to suggest the creation of a

department speciﬁcally devoted to parking
and transportation. Out of this evaluation, the
newly formed department was placed in
charge of providing safe, easy access to dif-
ferent parts of the campus and of monitoring
campus lighting.

Parking and Transportation has begun a
phase system in which lighting is added and
enhanced around campus in segments. Phase

This procedure, called “partial
birth” abortion by pro-life advocates,
would prohibit late-term abortions,
including cases of fetal anomalies or
those when the mother’s life was in dan-
ger.

“I’m pro-life,” said Janet Triglio,
who traveled from Cleveland, Ohio, to
attend the march. “I think I’m pro-life
because of the partial birth abortion
ban.”

“It’s a procedure that’s done on a
baby,” said Marie Buisette, who trav-
eled from St. Louis with her two daugh-
ters to participate in the March for Life.
“It’s not a cell or a mass of tissue at that
point, but a live baby with little arms
and little legs" and fingers and toes.”

After stopping in front of the
Supreme Court and the Capitol, demon-
strators visited state and local represen-
tatives, signed registration books, pre-
sented petitions, and in some cases
heard politicians speak.

Many Pittsburghers at the march
visited Congressman William Coyne’s
office. Coyne has been targeted by pro-
life activists for his support of abortion-
rights legislation.

‘The reason we come here is to tell
him that we’re his constituents, and
we’re pro—life,” said Chris Duarte, pres-
ident of Pitt’s Chapter of Students for
Life.

way up to Sutherland and the fraternity com-
plex, the area around Thackeray Hall, North
Bouquet Street, and the area around Forbes
Quad.

The implementation of phase three is to
begin in the coming months and will involve
the addition of lighting down O’Hara Street
from De Soto to Belleﬁeld with particular
concern being shown to Ruskin Avenue.

Also, the areas around the Chevron
Science Center, Fitzgerald Field House,
Trees Hall, and Forbes Quadaretobelooked
at for supplemental lighting.

  
  

Since the area of O’Hara Street falls
completely onto city property and runs close
to the University of Pittsburgh Medical
Center, Pitt will be approaching the city of
Pittsburgh and UPMC about support in this
venture very shortly.

“We are trying to work closely with the
city and UPM ,” said Harkins. “Since we
now have designs to fall back on, we are con-
ﬁdent to begin negotiations in the next three
weeks.”

The city of Pittsburgh will not take sole
responsibility for relighting O’Hara Street,
according to Harkins, because the lighting in
that area meets the legal requirement neces-
sary. However, Pitt administrators said it is in
the ‘best interest of the students that extra
lighting is provided.

Students such as SGB President Justin

  Pitt JazzQuintet

DalMo1in, Lea Shafer of the Panhellenic
Association, and Kim Yorty of the Nurses
Association, also pointed to such areas as the
Chevron Science Center, the walkway up the
hill diagonal from Scaife Hall, and Forbes
Avenue going towards Forbes Hall as places
in need of additional lighting.

Many of the students on the trip also
emphasized the need for greater lighting in
the Forbes Quad area extending towards
Bouquet Street.

They said Pitt st11dents living in South
Oakland frequently cross this area late at
night on their way home ﬁorn the library.

All suggestions made by oﬂicials and
students during the tour of Pitt’s campus were
written down. The comments and sugges-
tions will later be oornpiled and discussed by

Student safely must be
improved, not just campus safely

Parking and Transportation has begun a phase system
through which lighting would be improved around campus
to promote safety. This system was detailed last Thursday at
the Campus Safety Forum which included a walking tour of
the areas in which lighting will be added or enhanced.

The phase system goes as follows: phase one includes
lighting the Fifth -Avenue side of the Cathedral and areas
surrounding Hillman Library and the William Pitt Union;
phase two includes the Forbes and Belleﬁeld sides of the
Cathedral, the walkway up to Sutherland and the fraternity
complex, the area around Thackeray, North Bouquet Street,
and the area around Forbes Quad; phase three is to be
implemented in the coming months and is to include
O’Hara Street from De Soto to Belleﬁeld concentrating on
Ruskin Avenue. The areas around Chevron, Fitzgerald Field
House, and Trees Hall are to be looked at, as well.

This is a great start to improving campus safety, but it
leaves out many areas of importance. According to this
plan, the areas in which a great deal of the student popula-
tion live -~ North Oakland, South Oakland, Shadyside, and
Squirrel Hill — are completely overlooked. These areas are
often far from the beaten paths of the campus shuttle sys-
tem, and the safety of these students is as important as the
safety of those students who actually live on campus.

In order to improve the overall safety of this campus, all
of the- areas on and surrounding campus need to be taken
into account. Yes, it is a good thing if the lighting is
improved on O’Hara from De Soto to Belleﬁeld, but what
happens before you enter or after you exit this designated
safety area?

All efforts to improve campus safety should be
applauded, and this is a nice effort. The walking tour of the
already plarmed phases of the system was a great idea. An
even greater idea would be to extend that walking tour to
the areas in which students live and where safety precau-
tions are as important and necessary as those areas which
are already being examined. Campus safety is important,
but the main concern should be student safety.

What we should expect for the next 4

 

Last Monday, President Clinton
was sworn into his second consecu-
tive term as president of the United
States, becoming the ﬁrst Democrat
since FDR to win back—to-back
terms. With the iriauguiation (which
IamproudtosayIatterided)over
with, now it is time for the president
togetdowntotlieseriousbusinessof
leading America into the 21st centu-
ry.Iwouldliketoseetliepresidentdo
three things in his next term.

First, and I have said this time
and time again, and «will likely con-
tinue to preach about this in the
future, our entitlement system must
be reformed as soon as possible.
VVith the baby-boom generation
nearing retirement, the Social
Security trustees have predicted that
the trust fund will be bankrupt by the
year 2029. Politicians in both parties
have avoided speciﬁc solutions and
have proposed painless (but very
risky) gimmicks like investing the
money in the Social Security trust
fund in the stock market. Instead of
offering no-pain solutions, I would
like to see President Clinton and the
republicans sit down, forget all of
their petty bickering, and make some
tough choices. Ifnot, then by the year
2025, the federal government will
either have to devote the entire bud-
get to Social Security, Medicare, and
Medicaid, or it will be forced to raise
taxes 50 percent. Trust me. It’s better
to bite the bullet now rather than later:

Second, in addition to entitle-
ments, I also feel strongly that our
foreign policy need to be overhauled.
We have been extraordinarily lucky
in our dealings with foreign powers
over the last four years. Under the

abysmal stewardship of retiring

Secretary of State Warren
Christopher, the Clinton
Administration has (more or less)
stumbled upon success in Russia,
Bosnia,andtheMiddleEast. Inthe
near future, President Clinton will
likely tmn his attention more and
more towards foreign policy issues.
A variety of threats, foreign and
domestic, endanger Arnerica’s status
as the preeminent superpower in the
world, and traditionally, presidents
ﬁnd themselves consumed by for-
eign policy issues in their second
terms. FDR’s New Deal, for exam-
ple, was completed mostly in his ﬁist
and second terms. His third and
(short) fourth terms were devoted to
winning World War II and planning
for a post-war world

In his second term, I suspect that
the president may discover that
instead of the Islarriic fundamental-
ists of Iran or the Russian commu-
nist’s nostalgia for the good old days
oftheUSSR,thegreatestthreattothe
national security of the United States
of America might end up being the
naive members of Congress who fail
to realize that sacriﬁce and hard work
is needed in order for America to
continue to enjoy the position we
occupy.

Unfortunately, our foreign poli-
cy machine is not up to the challenge.
Workers at the State Department do
not have access to the intemet
because the department lacks the
money to buy modems. We spend
more money expanding a single
highway into Washington D.C. than
we do in supporting democracy in
Russia. Our foreign aid budget is so
puny that the State Department must
sciounge for money in order to aid
emerging democracies. I hope the
appointment of Madeleine Albright
to secretary of state will lend some

direction to the State Department, but
the president ought to go before the
American people and argue that
expanding our foreign aid budget is
vital to the continued prosperity of
the United States.

Third, the President should .

begin to set the stage for his succes-
sor in 2000 Vice President Gore.

I voted for Bill Clinton in 1996.
Although I’ve been satisﬁed by his
performance in the Oval Ofﬁce, Al
Gore has always been my ﬁrst choice

to occupy 1600 Pennsylvania‘

Avenue. A moderate Democrat like

myself, Gore has tirelessly worked ‘i
on complicated issues,.like disarrn- _

ing Russia’s vast nuclear stockpile,
reinventing government, and
improving the quality of the environ-
ment, with little fanfare but consider-
able eloquence. Traditionally, vice
presidents (e.g.: Quayle) have taken
practically no role in their adminis-
trations. Al Gore has worked hard to
ensure that President Clinton has
stayed true to his centrist course.
Although I like Bill Clinton, the
prospect of Al Gore becoming presi-
dent is more exciting to me.

When the president took the
oath of oﬂice, he had the Clinton

.family’s Bible opened to a rather

appropriate passage — Isaiah 58:12,
which reads, in part: “Thou shalt
raise up the foundations of many
generations; and thou shalt be called,
the repairer of the breach, the restor-
er of paths to dwell in.” Now the
President must work to ﬁnish the job
he started four years ago. Can the
sequel be better than the original? I
think so, and look for the president’s
second term to tum in a dynamite
performance in Clinton II.

Michael Berquist is looking forward
to seeing how the next four years will

I‘IVClIIZCIIIOn is not the answer I0 state problems

 

Governor Tom Ridge would like
to do away with the state liquor store
system and sell it to private mer-
chants. Unfortunately, the state liquor

store system is one of the very few,

institutions in Pennsylvania which
happens to turn a substantial profit.
Now that Pennsylvania realizes it has
something that works, Ridge seems in
a big hurry to get rid of it. Heaven
forbid we try to keep a successful
enterprise. _

What makes this idea even worse
is that Ridge wants to take the profit
from the sale and use it to fund the
construction of new stadiums and
arenas. What could look better for a
governor seeking a second term in
Harrisburg and a hopeful candidate
for the vice presidency of the United
States? Give ‘em what they want, and

you’ll look great. Right, Ridge?

Well, once the rest of us grab our
Steelers jerseys and shoot off to the
new stadium, we may hesitate when
we pay the $10 for parking and
another 50 bucks a pop for the tick-
ets. I can’t imagine that 12 ounce
beers will drop below their current $5

a glass. Wait a second —- this doesn’t
look so great anymore, does it, Gov?

Come to think of it, who will
really benefit from these new stadi-
ums? Will they be any closer for a
majority of Pennsylvanians than they
Erie

are already? Unless
Allentown is look
ing for profession-
al expansion
teams, most
Pennsylvanians
would still have to
drive hundreds of
miles to visit one
of these monu-
ments to the
mighty dollar.

The closer we
look at this dis-
eased idea, the fur-
ther we want to get
away from it. First
of all, privatiza-
tion will rip mil-
lions of projected
dollars from the state treasury and
slide them into the back pockets of
private businessmen. The Ridge
administration says that Pennsylvania
will still earn a profit by selling the
private liquor licenses. What we find

01'

by reading the fine print is that these
licenses will only be offered in limit-
ed numbers to certain individuals,
and the profit will be just pennies in
comparison. I don’t think so, Ridge.
Maybe not today, or even next
year, but soon the economic loss will
fall on the
Pennsylvanian work-
er. When those in
Harrisburg finally
cry “Whoops! Our
profit money is
gone!”, they won’t
be paying for it
themselves. They’ll
turn to us. And
buried under years of
bureaucracy, we’ll
have another case of
20/20' hindsight to
see that this move
was a mistake.
Privatization
will also cut over
4,000 well-paid jobs
from our economy. State liquor store
employees currently earn a fair
amount above minimum wage and
pull in retirement and health benefits.
They are qualified to check IDs and
sobriety, and to enforce the law, stop-

Pennsylvania will gain a highly

and no benefits, not many of the pri-
vatized store employees would care if
they sold a ﬂask of Jim Beam to a
stumbling inebriate or a two—year—old

And in the end, all we’ll get is a

Maybe we can even bring in an ex-
state store employee’s starving fami-
ly for a token “homeless day” at the
stadium. Tom could be there to hand
them their free turkey — that will
look pretty good for him, too.

As Pennsylvanians, we have too
much to lose on this “deal.” We can-
not let Ridge sugar-coat his political
campaigns destined to be funded by
future tax money. I’d like to drive to
Harrisburg to ask Governor Ridge
just what he thinks he’s doing, but the

Panthers top scoring record, blast Georgetown

 

 

The Pitt Panthers stonned
the nation’s capital Saturday,
breaking this season’s Big East
scoring record by demolishing
the Georgetown Hoyas 89-71.

Six Panthers registered dou-
ble ﬁgures, with Jason Maile and
Vonteego Oimmings leading the
team at 17 points each.
Freshman guard Kellii Taylor,
playing his first game in
Washington, D.C. since high
school, scored 15 points and reg-
istered l0 rebounds on the after-
noon.

“[Taylor] kept taking all my
defensive  said Chad
Varga, who had 15 points and
seven boards. “I had to tell him,
‘Hey, stop it.”’

As the Panthers would
prove, there were plenty of bas-
ketballs to go around Ten Pitt
players would score, with walk-
on Leon Murray registering his
only basket as the garne’s last
score.

The early scoring came
from Pitt’s frontcouit —— the trio
of Varga, Mark Blount, and
Gerald Jordan — that was held
silent for much of 'll1esday’s
game at Boston College. The
group scored 12 points in Pitt’s
game-opening 20-5 run, which
forced a Georgetown timeout at
the 13:14 mark

The Hoyas clawed to within
sixbytheendoftheﬁrst,onthe
strength of guard Victor Page. He
scored ﬁve straight points after
the stoppage, slowing the
Panther momentum and keeping
thegameclosefortheiestofthe
half. Page would lead the Hoyas
with 29 for the game.

“He’s just unbelievable,”
said Panther Head Coach Ralph
\Mllard about the Georgetown
star. “He uses his body so well.”

Lagging Hoyas
 ' Lill

Blount opened the second-
half scoring with a baseline
jumper, but Georgetown’s Ed
Sheﬂ°ey answered with a quick
three-point shot to cut Pitt’s lead
to ﬁve. Shelfey had ended the
ﬁrst with a three-pointer and was
threatening to start his own one-
man momentum swing.

Then, Maile broke open on
the offensive end and ﬁred up his
own three-point attempt — the
third of the evening that found
the mark for the Panther senior.
After a Georgetown free-throw,
the Panthers put an end to the
Hoyas’ last serious rim at the
lead.

Cummings took command,
dribbling up the court after Jahidi
White’s charity-stripe connec-
tion and ﬁnding Varga open
underneath for an alley—oop. The
sophomore guard called his own
number after a Georgetown
turnover, sinking a tliiee—pointer
and forcing a Hoya timeout.

John Thompson’s attempt at
slowing the Panthers proved
pointless, as Taylor rebounded
his own blocked shot and
hooked a two-point basket over
two Georgetown defenders. He
followed up on the next posses-
sion with a breakaway slam-
dunk, to the delight ofPitt fans in
attendance, especially Taylor’s
mother.

“It was a great homecoming
for him,” said Willard. “He cer-
tainly did a great job.”

The 9-0 Panther run was
stopped by a Page three-point
shot, but Maile was there to
answer, ﬁring ﬁom well beyond
the NBA three-point line at the
top of the key. Pitt went into the
ensuing media timeout with a
16-point advantage and was
never seriously challenged again.

Maile, Cummings, and
Taylor dominated the stat sheet,
but every Panther that saw action

 

 

made some type of contribution
to the 18-point victory. Blount,
who ﬁnished with 10 points, pro-
vided an inside presence that put
the 290-pound White off his
game. White, a junior who out-
weighs Bloimt by 60 pounds,
managed only 11 points.

Kevin Willard, who saw
some early action thanks to
Cummings’ foul trouble,
responded with two points and
ﬁve assists.

“He plays unbelievably hard _

all the time,” said Varga of
Willard “He gets us a lot of loose
balls—thatkindofst1iﬂ°doesn’t
show up on the stat sheet.”

Varga anchored the Pitt
offense for most of the day, dis-
tiibuting the ball on nearly every
possession and driving toward
the basket to open up the Hoya
defense. Midway through the
second half, one such drive
ended up with a two-handed
slam over three Hoyas, silencing
a sparse USAir Arena crowd.

Panther grcrpplers crush
four not-so-hot opponents

 

The warm-up portion of the
wrestling tearn’s schedule ended this
weekend with four more thrashings
against less-than-stellar competition. Pitt
outscored their opponents 168-24 in the
four lopsided contests without the ser-
vices of starters Chad Jesko, Larry
Sprecher, and Mark Bodo.

The team hopes to carry some of that
momentum with them as they take on
some of the elite teams in the country
over the next few weeks, beginning with
fourth-ranked Penn State on Friday.

Cleveland. State at Fitzgerald Field
House on Thursday night.

Viking’s Assistant Coach Matt
Ghaffari’s Olympic gold medal did not
help his Cleveland St. squad, which was
clearly outmatched by Pitt.

Cleveland St. jumped out to any
early 3-0 lead with Chuck Russo’s 6-4
win at the 118-pound weight class, but
the Panthers quickly responded with Rob
Loper’s 16-5 victory at 126.

“It was probably one of my best
matches all year,” Loper said. “I felt real-
ly good out there. I was all over him.”

Ben Dings followed that up with an
impressive technical fall at 134, increas-
ing the Panthers’ lead to 9-3.

“I was very happy to get the oppor-
tunity to compete again,” Dings said. “It
was my first dual meet in about two
years [because of his redshirt last year].”

Cleveland State’s victory at 142 cut
Pitt’s lead to 9-6, but it was the last match
they would win all night.

Kevin Johnson and Jacob Schaus
earned minor decisions at 150 and 158.
John Withrow, Rick Vettorel, and Jason
Bertoty eamed major decisions at 167,
190, and heavyweight. Bryan Matusic
recorded the only pinfall of the night at
the 177-pound weight class.

Pitt 53 Franklin and Marshall 0

Saturday’s home quad-meet includ-
ed the Panthers’ most lopsided victory of
the season, a 53-0 destruction of F&M.

F&M simply could not muster any
offense as the Panthers collected four
pins, two major decisions, two forfeits,
one minor decisions, and an injury
default. ,

Vettorel, Withrow, Mike Dixon, and
Dings pinned their opponents, with
Dings’ win coming in just 25 seconds.

' Loper was leading F&M’s Greg

Knox 9-3 when Knox was injured and
could not continue, giving Loper the
default victory.

Matusic’s 21-8 victory, Schaus’s 6-0
shutout, and Johnson’s 16-5 win further
increased the Panther’s slaughter.

“I’m slowly starting to see improve-
ment,” said J ohnson, who did not wrestle
last year. “But I’m not where I want to be
yet.” a

The forfeits were earned by 118-
pounder Chris Stevens and heavyweight
Jason Bertoty.

Pitt 44 Coppin State 9

Pitt continued their weekend route
by stomping Coppin State. The Eagles
won only two matches compared to the
Panthers’ eight.

The Panthers dropped matches at’
134 and heavyweight, but remained _

ﬂawless at all other weight classes.

Loper won 14-6 at 126. Dixon
pinned his opponent at 142. Johnson
rolled to a 21-8 victory at 150, and
Schaus and Withrow earned pinfalls at
158 and 167.

“I wanted to work on a few take-
downs,” Withrow said. “We didn’t just
beat them,but we also broke them men-
tally, which is what we wanted to do.”

Freshman Dave Galati earned his
first collegiate victory at 190, also by
way of a pin.

“I’m glad we have the opportunity to
get some of the young guys like me
experience in these matches,” Galati
said. “I was just glad to be able to help
the team.”

Stevens and Matusic earned forfeits 3

at 118 and 177.
Pitt 40 Duquesne 9

Pitt wrapped up Saturday’s quad-
meet by wrapping up cross-town rival
Duquesne.

The Dukes didn’t even

118, 126, 167, and 190 —-— giving the

Panthers a 24-0 lead before the contest 

even began.

Dings earned a 7-3 win at 134, and
Dixon won 5-3 at 142. Matusic earned a
major decision with his 12-4 win at the
177-pound weight class.

Pitt’s Jacob Schaus pinned
Duquesne’s Joe Bucciero late in the ﬁrst
period.

“It was a pretty quick match,”
explained Schaus. “I caught him in a cra-
dle, and that was pretty much it.”

Duquesne’s Mark Rohaly earned an
11-7 win at 150, and their heavyweight
Wally Wickline won by way of a pinfall,

Pitt’s record is now 9-2 and 2-0 in
the EWL.

Freshman snatches all-around
title in second collegiate meet

Head Coach Debra Yohman knew she
could count on excellent performances by
veteran gymnasts Robyn Senior, Erika

Flarner, and Lori Buck. What she had not

counted on, but was not surprised by, was
the performance of newcomer Danielle
Alba.

Alba, “Freddie” to her teammates, went
out last night for only her second collegiate
meet ever and scored a school record 38.95
to win the individual all-around.

Alba was not even supposed to perform
in the all-around competition. Yohman put
her in anyway, even though she joined the
team as a freshman only three weeks ago.

Pitt ﬁnished in second place last night at
Trees Gym with a score of 190.575, beating
the University of Maryland and Bowling

 

Green University, but falling to East Atlantic
Gymnastics League rival University of New
Hampshire.

Coach Yohman has high expectations
for this year’s team. “Freddie set an all-
around record tonight,” said Yohman. “We
should do that every wee .”

The leadership of seniors Lori Buck and
Robyn Senior is an importantfactor in the
success of this year’s team. “I expect them to
be leaders,” said Yohman.

. Senior scored a 38.725, securing second
place in the all-around and showing her lead-
ership in her performance.

Buck came in and performed well as a
specialist, getting a third-place tie on the bal-
ance beam.

Pitt’s potent combination of experi-
enced seniors and young upstarts should
make every meet this season as exciting as
any in Pitt gyrrmastics history.

Hoops?

team that couldn’t miss. They shot .424
—— not bad, but not enough to challenge
the Panther offense. Victor Page made
11 of 22, Ed Cheffey sank five of 10, and
Jahidi White hit four of six in the losing
effort. They helped the Hoyas come
back at halftime being down by only six,
but in the end, Pitt was too much.

On the season, the Panthers are
shooting .405, and the opposition is
shooting .403. The Panther record is 10-
9. Notice that the shooting percentages
are even, and the record is even.

 

In the worst shooting day for the
Panthers against Seton Hall, they lost
53-51. Pitt shot .284 from the ﬁeld. In
the first two games of the season in
which Pitt lost to Illinois State and Navy,
they shot .340 and .396, respectively.

On the other side, the Panther’
destruction of Carnegie Mellon saw Pitt

shoot .500 with a .333'three-point per-
centage. Pitt’s great shooting helped to
stop a tough Duquesne team — the

"Panthers won 75-73 while shooting

.490.

O’Donnell, whose two interceptions
made the difference in the game.

For myself, being a young col-
lege student who sometimes has little
regard for the law and proper behav-
ior, this should be expected. I mean,
not to say that I’m some kind of bad
ass, but on a whole, most college
guys I know usually bend the rules
every now and then. You know —
underage drinking, kicking rubbish,
climbing radio towers, and whatnot.
College is a care-free time of fun and
frolic, and that is why breaking a bot-
tle or screaming at a little box does-

n’t cross my mind twice.

However, in the “real world,”
breaking a bottle is the least of the
public’s worries. Super Bowl Sunday
has one of the highest accounts of
spousal abuse of any day in the year.

So, I guess some guys think it’s
all right to slap your wife around
because your favorite team lost or
you just blew a C—note on a last sec-
ond field goal that messed up the
point spread.

Wrong. This, of course, is not
cool. In fact, it’s horrible, and it is
something that should be addressed.
I’d rather have some idiot throw a
bottle, instead of his wife, against the
wall.

The Super Bowl is an American

tradition that has surpassed all other
sporting events. It is the mecca of
season-ending games. Over a hun-
dred million Americans watch it, and
a 30-second commercial costs $1
million and upwards. For all the joy
and hoopla enthralled in this day,
there are many women for whom it is
a nightmare each year.

The Super , Bowl is so
Americanized that it’s sickening.
First, football is only played in

America and nowhere else. Well, it’s .

played in Canada, but their football is
strange with only three downs and a
mile-long end zone.

Second, there are so many
pregame shows within the two-week
waiting period that by the end, even
the teams’ punters are analyzed and
broken down. To say the media cov-
erage on the Super Bowl is overdone

is an understatement. ESPN has foot- -

ball from dawn until dusk. I think
I’ve seen the ‘69 Jets Super Bowl-
win highlights five times.

Third, it is typical of Americans
to turn something fun and exciting,
like a world championship, into a
mass media, wager/betting, free-for-
all that brings out the worst in some
Americans.

I’m not trying to ruin the Super
Bowl for you by putting nasty little
thoughts into your head, but I want to
