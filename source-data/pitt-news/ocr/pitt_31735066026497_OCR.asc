Housing
project
proposed

By Mark Gordon
Asst. News Editor

A Texas architect says the
Panther Hollow Lot might
be converted into a high-
tech housing project within
two years, but Pitt officials
say nothing is definite about
the proposals.

Associate Vice Chancellor
for Business and Finance
John DeVitto emphasized
that as far as Pitt is con-
cerned, nothing is in the
final stages.

“The university has not
ordered anything to be
done,” DeVitto said. “They
[the architects] have not
made any proposals, and
they have not sent any-
thing.”

The Panther Hollow Lot is
located behind Schenley
Park and at the end of
Boundary Street in South
Oakland and has been
owned by Sol Gross, a
Pittsburgh developer, for
over a year.

“The Oakland community
and the city of Pittsburgh
are asking Mr. Gross to con-
struct housing for students,
grad students, fraternity
housing, staff, faculty and
low-income housing,’.’.,said
Martin Growald, a Texas
architect who has been hired
by Gross to work on the lot.

Growald described the
facility as a state of the art
housing complex that will
have football, baseball, soft-
ball and soccer fields on the
grounds.

“We’re going to empha-
size on making this housing
the best student housing in
the world, not just in the

No change in   minority scholarships

By Linda Wisniewski
Staff‘ Writer

Pitt will not change its policies on providing
specialty designated financial aid to under-rep-
resented minority graduate and undergraduate
students, despite an October 1994 ruling made
by the U.S Court of Appeals. ,

According to the January 1995 edition of the
Advocate, the graduate and professional news-
paper of the University of Pittsburgh, the U.S.
Court of Appeals prevailed that the University
of Maryland at College Park could not limit a
scholarship program for African-American stu-
dents.

“There are no similarities to the situation at
the University of Maryland and Pitt, or any
other Pennsylvania institution right now,” said
Ken Service, director of communications at the
University of Pittsburgh.

He said the ruling was based on a court case
that was arguing previous discrimination on
that campus. .

He said race-based scholarship programs are
legitimate when trying to create a more diverse

background at a school. .

“Here, we are committed to encouraging
diversity,” he said. ’

‘‘It’s a complicated matter,” said Jack Daniel,
vice provost for academic affairs.

“From my understanding, if a university,

wants to have scholarships to get a wider vari-
ety of students, they should be allowed to do
so,” he said.

Service said there are two‘ scholarship pro-
grams that are restricted only to African
Americans at Pitt. They are the Helen Faisson
and the Robert LaVelle scholarships.

He said that one Robert LaVelle scholarship
will be awarded starting this coming fall semes-
ter, and that five are given each year for the
Helen Faisson.

“The students that get those scholarships are
qualified academically as well as being
African-American,” said Service.

He said that most scholarships are limited in
one way or another, whether it be on the basis
of gender, ethnic origin, religion, etc. The main
goal when deciding who gets scholarships is to

School of Nursing receives research award

By Vanessa BTooks
For The Pitt News

Researchers at the University" of
Pittsburgh’s School of Nursing can now
continue their work on developing studies
to improve the quality of life for patients
suffering from chronic health disorders
with a $1.5 million research award.

The grant was awarded to the nursing
school by the National Center for Nursing
Research, a branch of the National
Institute of Nursing Research. -

“The study will generate a body of
knowledge that will help understand
chronic health disorders across all dis-
eases and populations,” said Mary Jane
Bemier, a project coordinator.

Pitt’s nursing school was chosen with
four other schools across the country to
receive the award. The grant was awarded
to aid an expansion of existing studies
being done by ﬁve researchers previously
funded by the National Center for
Nursing Research.

The grant will be dispersed over a ﬁve-
year period, with $300,000 per year,
according to the Health Sciences News
Bureau. The money will pay for
researcher’s studies, the formation of an
administrative corps for overall guidance,
a support corps to analyze data and a
development corps to offer training and
other developmental activities to each of
the studies. ‘

Although the researchers have done

previous studies on chronic health disor-
ders, such as the HIV virus and breast and
cervical cancers, there is still more on the
program’s agenda, said Jacqueline
Dunbar—Jacob, the principle investigator
and director of the grant program.

“The four areas we intend to examine in
patients with each disorder are functional
ability, cognitive ability, quality of life
and biological outcomes,” said Dunbar-
Jacob. “These outcomes can be examined
both within and across each disorder,

helping to develop our knowledge of -

effective intervention strategies for each
disease.”
If the studies are successful and used to
create beneficial programs, they should

Grant given for HIV project

By Nicole Walz
Staff Writer

The University of Pittsburgh’s
School of Medicine has been
awarded a three-year grant for
the development of the Pitt HIV
Early Intervention Project.

- “This project will create new
services as well as expand exist-
ing clinical services for individ-
uals with the HIV offered

’ through the Pittsburgh Aids

Center for Treatment,” said
Deborah McMahon, M.D.
McMahon is the principal
investigator of the new project
and medical director for the
Pittsburgh Treatment Evaluation
Unit, which is the site of AIDS
clinical trials at UPMC.

The Ryan White grant is the

Award

only new early HIV-interven-
tion project that has been fund-
ed this year in Pennsylvania and
the other mid-Atlantic states.
The first year of funding will
total more than $429,000.

“We believe that [UPMC]
was chosen because we have
the track record‘ and capability
 our proposal was quite unique
in the services for women and
HIV-infected patients that are in
need of mental health services,”
said Cynthia Klemanski, project
director for the HIV Early
Intervention Project.

The award is from the Ryan
White Comprehensive AIDS
Resources Emergency Act of
1990, which was passed by
Congress to provide health care
and support services to people

living with HIV and AIDS. The
legislation is named for the late
Ryan White, a 13-year-old
hemophiliac who died from
AIDS.

“Expanded services will
include accessto specialty clini-
cal care, enhanced mental health
counseling and targeted clinical
services for women with
HIV disease,” said Dr. Linda
Frank, co—principal investigator
and deputy director of the pro-
ject.

New services, such as HIV
testing and counseling, will
soon be offered on site at the
UPMC and at multiple sites in
medically under-served areas of
Western Pennsylvania. These
services are being implemented
in the first few months of 1995.

recruit quality students.

“All scholarships are given
according to academic merit,”
he said.

“The reality is that the
Chancellor’s 21st century
recruitment goals focusing on
enhancing the level of diversi-
ty at Pitt cannot be realized
without sufficient merit—based
scholarships,” said Daniel in
the January edition of the

I Advocate.

However, according to
Service, minority enrollment
at Pitt is good in comparison
with other similarly ranked
institutions.

He said Pitt is ranked sev-
enth among public schools for
minority enrollment. He said
approximately 6.7 percent of
the student population is
African-American and the
overall percentage for minori-
ties is 10.4 percent.

“We are seeing an -increase
in applications for African-
American students,” said

Opinions  
Parental duly is the law

Parents whose children break the law may find themselves
accountable in some places. With the number of juvenile offend-
ers increasing, making parents more accountable may help curb
the crime problem. While good parents can’t be legislated into
existence, it may ultimately be possible" to get more people
involved in preventing juvenile offenses.

Most parental-duty laws are narrow in focus. As long as they
remain that way and do not get out of hand, they are a useful
tool for dealing with juvenile crime. In 33 states, parents whose
children commit crimes can be forced to pay restitution for the
misdeeds. According to USA Today, a parental-duty law in Flint,
Mich., has contributed to decreasing the number of kids out
after a curfew.

A California law says parents must “exercise reasonable care,
supervision, protection and control” over their children. The law
has allowed authorities to get parents involved in counseling to
help them deal with the acts of their children. Sandi Gibbons of

the Los Angeles District Attorney’s office was quoted in USA

Today as saying: “It’s sparingly used. A case has to be appropri-
ate.” Presumably this would mean a situation where it is obvi-

ous by the child’s record that the parent has lost control or con- ;

tact. It should not be haphazardly applied, but with strict guide-
lines on its use. The state should not take over raising children
nor begin using the law to popularize some current political
pundit’s idea of morality and family values.

This law is on a slippery slope, andthus must be watched
carefully for potential abuse. Parents oftentimes carmot control
the actions of their teenage children, for instance, and’ cannot
always exert parental control at a distance. At the same time,
however, if intelligently used, it can make the difference

between parents getting involved at an early stage and kids get-

ting out of control.

End price fixing

The major airlines said this month that they were cancelling
the traditional 10 percent commission rate for travel agencies.
Instead, they will pay only $50 on round-trip tickets and $10 on
one-way fares for domestic ﬂights.

In response, the American Society of Travel against has filed
an anti-trust suit against the airlines. According to Reuters News
Agency, the move by the airline amounted to price fixing.

This move will severely inconvenience those who use travel
agencies. If the cap is allowed to stand, it will cause the travel
agencies to pass their cost on to consumers. '

The move was initiated by Delta Air Lines, and American and
United followed suit. The agents are also seeking a restraining
order against the cap until the case is resolved.

The courts should uphold the 10 percent rate so that the travel
agents cannot lord it over the travel agencies. This way, the
choice of people to use travel agencies and search out the best
fares for themselves will still be available.

OJ: not just a breakfast drink...

e overwhelming publici-
I ty surrounding the O.J.
Simpson trial has spawned
a confusing response from a
country which treats its televi-
sion sets like religious shrines.
It’s hard to believe some people
feel the media has overexposed
the Simpson case. From the
evening news, torhours of court-
room coverage, people are tum-
ing their televisions off in a des-
perate attempt to hide from what
they deem excessive coverage. 9
These same people believe

that the television cameras have

exposed a greedy American sub-
culture which feeds on those in
compromised situations to fur-
ther their own economic inter-
ests. I’m talking about card and
autograph collectors who have
made windfall proﬁts on their
Simpson memorabilia due to the
saturation of coverage the case is
receiving. I say, “bah, humbug”
to all those pseudo-righteous
fanatics who are out to spoil a
favorite American sport. As in
duck hunting, the most enjoyable
part is watching the target fall.

I find coverage of the Simpson
case inadequate. There isn’t
nearly enough coverage to satiate
my desire for more information.
Why should trial coverage be
interrupted for the news? What’s
more important than the fate of
America’s beloved O.J.? Our
national psyche is threatened if
an American hero like O.J. is
found guilty. Despite his millions
of dollars, O.J. still represents the
everyday man. Sure, he beat his
wife, but that’s— what makes him
more appi-aling. Americans
aren’t perfect people. Americans
are hard working, dirt-under-
their-ﬁngemails, ﬂawed people".
This is why all great American
heroes are ﬂawed. They’re repre-
sentative of the millions who
admire them. Mickey Mantle is
an alcoholic, John Kennedy was
a womanizer, George
Washington had false teeth and
O.J. Simpson is a drug-abusing

wife beater.
However, if O.J. were convict-
ed of murder, that would disqual-

‘ ify him as an American hero,

since many Americans aren’t
murderers.‘ Therefore, we
Americans need as much press
coverage as possible to deter-
mine whether O.J. is a hero or
murderer.

Aside from not breaking away
from trial coverage, further steps
need implementation to increase
coverage of O.J.’s plight. Put a
camera in O.J.’s cell. I want to
watch him eat, sleep, dream
about Judge Ito and write a book.
Furthermore, I’d like to see a bill
passed in Congress that requires
Fox to broadcast trial coverage in
the afternoon instead of their
children’s lineup. The com-
mencement of these steps would
be an excellent start toward recti-
fying the inadequate coverage of
O.J. that has thus far found its
way into disappointed homes.

In‘ addressing those who feel
the “excessive coverage” has
bred a disgusting wrinkle in
American culture, I argue that
nothing could be further from the
truth. While it’s true that thou-
sands of people have converged
on the Simpson estate in an
unequaled orgy of curiosity and
entrepreneurial spirit, it would be
wrong to label this mass action
as devious, dubious or distaste-
ful. .

On the contrary, those selling
t-shirts or offering guided tours
for a small fee are embracing
everything that is America. They
are capitalists and opportunists.

But echoes of discontent -still

bounce off the windows of the
courthouse and the Simpson
estate.

These aberrant voices com-
plain about the morals of those
who buy and sell Simpson mem-
orabilia for profit or future proﬁt.
These are the voices of com-
plaining and jealous people
whose ‘mothers threw out their
O.J. Simpson cards and, in the

process, a. couple of hundred dol-
lars. While it’s true that the price
of O.J. Simpson cards has sky-
rocketed with the windfall of
publicity, all can not be blamed
on an immoral and greedy
American culture.

The fact is O.J. was a great
football player. He was a

.. Heisman Trophy winner, a mem-

ber of football’s hall of fame and
an actor. It’s the logical law of
supply and demand. If Jeffery
Dahmer played professional
football, his cards would have
increased in value as well, pro-
viding he hadn’t eaten them all.
Unfortunately, Dahmer wasn’t a
football player — he was more
of a gourmet, and there are no
cards on the market for culinary
stars.

O.J. Simpson is living the
American dream. He’s garnering
more television coverage now
than in all his years playing foot-
ball. Still, Americans need toisee
much more coverage. Every’
magazine and newspaper should
have pictures of O.J. and his
lawyers.

Unfortunately, pictures of
Nicole Simpson, along with
"Robert Goldman have popped
up next to pictures of O.J. Who
are these people?‘ They didn’t
win a Heisman, or get elected to
the Hall of Fame. They didn’t
jump over airport seats in a Hertz
commercial, nor did they have

' minor roles in all three Naked

Gun movies. Why should they
get so much attention?
It’s time newspaper editors as.
well as television producers give
O.J. his just due and spend more
time covering O.J.’s trial. We
Americans want serious news
and information that concerns us
directly, not news of minor
events and wars occurring half
way around the globe. Please
don’t pass the O.J., give me
more of it — much more.

believer in the power of the
press.

Columnist amn-

of bowling

must really be something spe-
cial. If I knew it could work
such wonders for me the way
it has worked wonders for the

.Pitt basketball team, I would
have joined a league years
ago. Who knew?

During a recent nine-day
layoff, Pitt coach Ralph
Willard took the team out for
a night of male bonding and
relaxation. There must have
been something in the smoke-
filled alleys that’s brought
this team closer together.

The Panthers over recent
days have struck it rich at a _
critical point of the season,
with plenty of time to spare to
turn what has been a gutter
ball of a season into a memo-
rable stretch run. '

The team won two games
in a row before dropping to
Syracuse on Tuesday, and has
been playing the type of bas-
ketball coach Willard wants
them to play. Good ball
movement and lots of three-
point’ shots, and tough, in-
your-face defense at the other
end of the hardwood.

The time off between
games has allowed the tired
legs and broken hearts of the
Panthers to get back to the
basics of what Willard is
teaching them. And the team
has responded with its best
ball of the season.

“It’s taken some time,”
Willard said. “They’re great
kids who are ﬁnally getting
some payback. The time off
has allowed us to be fresher
mentally.”

With the Panthers playing
their best ball of the season
right now and the hustle that
they've played with all sea-
son, this will be a team most
opponents will not want to
face in the opening round of
the Big East Tournament at
Madison Square Garden.

It’s a given that the
Panthers will play hard at
both ends of the court for a
full 40 minutes. And the
Panthers have the confidence
to know that they can stay
with any team for an entire
game.

So if the Panthers can come
out and play the way they’re
playing right now and keep
sinking three-pointers, Pitt is
ripe for pulling off a major
upset.

I guarantee that John
Thompson of Georgetown
and Jim Boeheim of Syracuse
don’t want to see this Pitt
team as their opening round
opponent next month.

The Lady Panthers were able to
ﬁght off a pesky Syracuse team
and win their second Big East
Conference match-up in a row,
70-67 last night at Fitzgerald
Field House.

Pitt led the entire second half
after Stephanie Petho hit two free
throws with 16:16 left to play,
which put the Panthers ahead 37-
36. Pitt had numerous leads of

eightpoints taken away by the

gutsy play of game-high scorer

Racquel Nurse of Syracuse.

7 Nurse fin-

ished with

19 points,

e i g h t

rebounds

and four

assists on
the night.

The closest the Orangewomen

could get in the second half was »

68-67, before junior forward
Tressa Bolfert rebounded a
missed shot and hit a layup to seal
the Pitt victory.

“We had a little vendetta against
them [Syracuse],” Pitt head coach
Kirk Bnice said. “Maybe this was
how we were supposed to win
this game, but all we wanted to do
anyway was win.”

Leading the way for the Lady
Panthers was senior Jenine Joyce.

Men's swim has eye on

I By Ed Ziegenfuss

Staff Writer .

The drive for number 12 will
begin Thursday, when the
men’s swimming and diving
team takes to the pool in
defense of its Big East
Championship.

Head coach Chuck Knoles
sounds confident when he
talks about his team’s chances.

“We are going to behard to
beat,” Knoles said. “I think we
are more ready this year than
we’ve ever been. The nature of
this meet getting faster and
faster every year has led to our
preparation. We have been
preparing for this meet inten-
sively for two weeks.”

Leading the way for the
Panthers will be an experi-
enced senior class headed by
Matt Brady. The other seniors
in this class are Jonti
Bacharach, Ryan Bair, Gary
Mulé, Jeff Novotny and David
Williams.

“We will need some phe-
nomenal performances from
our seniors,” Knoles said. “We
have a very strong, outgoing
senior class.” . .

Also showing promise for a
strong meet is the freshman
class of the Panthers compet-
ing in its first conference
championship. This class is led
by Pete Hezky, Steve Lewter,

Michael ‘McQueen, Bob
Nooning, Eric Stefansky and
diver Chris Curry.

Joyce broke out of a scoring
slump and scored 18 points to go
along with nine rebounds.

‘The biggest thing when I am
not playing well is that I think I
am hurting the team,” Joyce said.

.“I thought today that I would

come out and work hard on
defense and when you do that, the
offense comes.”

Syracuse led at the half 30-29,
thanks to poor shooting and
rebounding on Pitt’s behalf. The
Orangewomen were led in the
ﬁrst stanza by the inside play of
Thandeka Masimini, who had
eight points_ and three rebounds.
Pitt had a lowly 29 percent shoot-
ing from the ﬂoor in the ﬁrst half.
The only thing that prevented a
Syracuse blowout was a perfect
eight-for-eight from the free
throw line.

Pitt came out in the second half
and controlled the boards and
warmed up from the ﬂoor to seal
the win. Petho led the Lady
Panthers scoring with 12 in the

second half to ﬁnish with 14 for V ’

the game. As a team, Pitt out-
rebounded Syracuse 39-35 on the
game.

“We had to stop their inside
play,” Bruce said. “We out-
rebounded them in the second
half, there in lied a big part of the
game.”

It may have looked as if Pitt

would have had a decided advan-

“I think our most important
factor in this championship
will be how our freshmen
stand up and race,” Knoles
said. “They will be nervous,
but I have a good gut feeling
that they will be swimming
fast. On either side of the spec-
trum, the freshmen and the
seniors, is where we will have
to see our great performances.”

The sophomore and junior
classes are not to be taken
lightly, however. Led by divers
Jeremy McClean and John
Soulakis and swimmers Chris
Balke, Josh Heynes, Chris
Perry, Eric_ Stull, Tony Sunseri
and Sami Vartiainen, the
sophomores and juniors will
solidify the Panther lineup.

“Our sophomores and
juniors have been very consis-
tent this year,” Knoles said. “I
expect them to perform very
well.”

The leading competition for
the Panthers’ drive their 12th
title in 13 years will come
from Miami and Syracuse.

The Hurricanes blow into
town with the two outstanding
performers from last year’s
meet. Swimmer Tamas

Deustch, who set Big East‘

records in the 100- and 200-
backstrokes, and diver Chemi
Gil will lead the Miami
charge.

“Miami brings a boatload of
points into diving,” Knoles
said, “that gives them a 90 to
100 point advantage over us.

Syracuse had only eight total

Orangewomen bench scored 20

Pitt’s subs.

“They played the game how

However, their depth in swim-
ming is a lot less than ours.”

Syracuse will also be chas-
ing down Pitt in the standings.
The Orangemen defeated both
Pitt and Miami in ,a dual meet
earlier this season.

-“We haven’t seen a lot of

development from Syracuse,”
Knoles said. “They are not
typically a big surprise.”

Villanova will be the fourth

‘team to figure in the final
standings, although the
Wildcats should be playing the
role of spoiler.

“Villanova will not be a fac-
tor in the top three,” Knoles
said. “They are very definitely
going to have some events that
they are going to win and be
spectacular in, which is going
to take away from either
Miami, Pitt, or Syracuse.”

Pitt will definitely be the
team that everyone else in gun-
ning for this weekend. Big
East Championship No. 12 is
in reach and the Panthers are
looking to celebrate it Sunday
night.

“It is not going to be easy to

beat us,” Knoles said assured-

It is now or never for the
women’s swim team. The rest of

the meets have just been practice '

for this meet. The Big East
Championships are finally here.

Although the team has worked
extremely hard this season, their
record of 4-7 is less than impres-
sive. Many members of the team
feel that this is a positive for
them entering the Big East
Championships.

“Although our record was bet-
ter last year, I feel more conﬁ-
dent entering the Big East
Championships,” said senior
captain Vicki Geubtner. “I think

that we are going to use our ‘

record to our advantage. There is
no pressure on us. Last season
we felt a lot of pressure going
into the Big East Championships
because our record during our
dual meet season was so good.
No one is expecting us to go
very far. We are going to use this
and hopefully shock a lot pf peo-
ple.” '

Sex, Drugs and Democracy

.Co-pr_oduced, filmed and edited by

Jonathan Blank

Now that Newt Gingrich era politics-

are in full swing, and the Congressional
pulpit is busy babysitting the United
States (just this weekthe exclusionary
rule was abolished, allowing illegally
obtained -evidence to be presented in
court), goddamn it we need a docu-
mentary like Sex,
Democracy. Jonathan Blank’s film
about The Netherlands would have us
believe Dutch society is a utopian
Disneyland of dope-smoking Goofies
who begin their day at hashish bars
before bearing all on sun-drenched

beaches, only to get dressed again and

window-shop for the perfect after-din-
ner prostitute. Down and dirty and non-
exploitive, safer sex in a land of dykes
(pun intended). Then they may go dig
Spinoza after an all-night rave.

“The movie is not an attempt to be
the be-all documentary on Holland,”
Blank says in a phone interview. “lt’s
really about America.” Although little
on-screen suggests the 50 states,
Blank’s method assumes an American
audience. Blank uses Holland's per-

missive social policies to present a .

model of “real” democracy for the rest
of the supposed democratic world,
especially the United States, so that
audiences will become aware of our
ever-dwindling rights to privacy and
individual freedom. An intentional one-
dimensional portrait used to contrast
the United States, Blank admits his film
is nothing more than a lush snap-shot
of a society with an economy that is
government-run and has hands-off
social policies (prostitution, marijuana,
hashish and LSD are all legal) — with
better results than most Western-
industrialized societies.

According to Blank, Holland has the
lowest rates of teen pregnancy and
abortion in the world, yet teenage sex

is acceptable and encouraged; Holland
also has the lowest imprisonment rate
in the world, he said. “The Puritan
nerve is manifesting itself in really right-
wing politics here,” he said. “People in
America have no idea how much our
democracy has eroded.” .

Yet for all Sex, Drugs and
Democracy’s inspired jabbering of lib-
erty and Haight-Ashbury politics, the
documentary’s vapid texture relies on

-cheap schlock-shock value images to

pique American interest. Whenever

Drugs and _

 

Blank’s superficial collage of
Amsterdam's sights and sounds begins
to hit on any significant issues (such as
lesbian preachers in the Catholic
Church or Holland’s relatively classless
society which, theoretically, permits
prostitution that is non-exploitive(?)),
Blank quickly regrounds us in the easi-
ly accessible images of foot-long joints
and scantily clad women. -

A seemingly unmotivated shot of a
man's fully tattooed and pierced
gonads is thrown into the hodgepodge
without explanation. A cheap, value-
less image it is; you can bet tattooed
nuts can be found anywhere in any
major metropolitan area. Go figure why
it’s singled out in Amsterdam. 1

$3‘

Straightforward shock-value shots
such as this are piled relentlessly on
top of one another, leaving little room
for a thorough presentation of the com-
plex issues presented in the film. In his
attempt to show us every aspect of
Holland's free society, Blank can only
approach each subject with a cursory
treatment, at best. The film feels like a
travelogue for The Netherlands —— a
press release couldn't have portrayed a
happier society. T

Problems with this film are primarily
based on the fact that it’s such a one-

  

  Jonathan Blcmk hits uﬁaaaiéiaaa ﬁeawe with Sex, Drugs and 

note portrait. Blank has found a great
topic for documentary, and all he wants
is to hold this picture up to America and
suggest implementing such policies.
which is just fine, it acts as a much-
needed counter-balance to America's
paranoid, Reefer Madness sensibilities.
Goddammit I want to embrace this film,
but these sentiments are only so
because Holland itself is what's really
interesting.

On the phone Blank concedes
Holland does have its share of prob-
lems, such-as a high suicide rate, but
there’s no mention of this or other
gloomier topics found in all societies.
Even down to the film’s shooting
schedule, Blank omits an imae that

  

  
   

could turn off viewers. Almost every
sequence was shot in a hyper-verdant
Springtime (except for some winter-
wonderland shots of sledding and ice
skating). There’s no mention of Slavic
organized crime infiltrating the sex
industry, or the growing rate of AIDS
within the prostitute population.

Blank said, “Yeah, there’s some
Slavic people doing prostitution.
There's organized crime in everything. I
don't refute that there’s organized
crime in the sex industry.” And in

regards to the Springtime shooting »

 

 

schedule, which illicits a flat and one-
dimensional picture of Holland's cli-
mate, Blank said, “We happened to be
there when there was good weather,
which was our good fortune."

lf Blank’s comments seem a bit
defensive, it’s because they are. His
documentary (a difficult mode of film-

’ making to succeed in, to begin with)

has received heavy flak from so-called
liberal magazines. The Village Voice’s
Ben Greenman panned the film from

the intellectual position that Sex, Drugs ’

and Democracy is intolerably superfi-
cial. While Greenman’s’ position is

dead-accurate, he may have missed,

Blank’s humbly stated intentions. “I
simply wanted to point out Holland’s
policies,” Blank said. Although a cop
out, allowing Blank to abdicate his
responsibility to make a provocative
documentary, one has to keep these
intentions in mind while viewing.

On the phone, Blank cited appalling
statistics such as the percentage of
American corporations that test their
employees for drug use: 87 percent.
Blank’s film also attempts to raise a
new consciousness in America’s.post-
Joycelyn Elders “keep masturbation in
the closet” era of sexual politics.

In Holland, Blank said, “sex is consid-
ered totally normal. lt’s-like brushing
your teeth, it’s something you do with
your body  [in their society]_ there’s
nothing to consider that the body would
be dirty.” Unfortunately, Blank’s treat-
ment of the body and chemicals in Sex,
Drugs and Democracy falls just short of
a Hans Christian Anderson fairy tale.
With regards to legalized prostitution,
the co-existence of the down/dirty and
safer/non-exploitive seems too good to
be true, and one has to question
whether or not this could ever be so in
any society. ,

In Sex, Drugs and Democracy such
questions are never raised. However
genuine Blank’s intentions may be, it is
obvious he's bitten off more than he
can chew. These topics are too far-
reaching for Blank’s 87-minute g|ossu-

mentary — it’d require endless hours of ‘

film to complete the monumental
undertaking he has begun. _

Sex, Drugs and Democracy opens
this Friday at the Flex Theatre, South
Side. Call 381-2200 for sho wfimes.

Do you always find yourself com-
plaining about being bored in Pitts-
ville? It just so happens that four great
shows are coming our way just in time
for a study break. So if you're able to
get off your lazy ass, take my advice
and be entertained. These are high-
class endeavors that shouldn't be
missed!

The first show that gets my blood
boiling is Zar. This female duo is a
force to be reckoned with. It's no secret
that the Avant-Rock scene is dominat-
ed by iconclastic men: Zorn, Sharp, et
al. So one shouldn't be surprised that
these men have looked to Kate
O’Looney (drums) and Jo Thirion (key-
boards) for inspiration and backing.
O’Looney is a veteran of Carbon and
No Safety, as well as countless other
projects. Thirion is one of France's

leading keyboard players and com-'

posers. Together their music is chilling-
ly precise to wildly atmospheric. Enjoy
their video/slide projection display.
Cleveland's Out of Order Trio and
local Avant-Jazz sensations 40 Stories
will open the show. This show is
Friday, Feb 24, at CMU’s Women's
Center, Margaret Morrison Street.
Music starts at 8 p.m.

Also on Friday, if mind-boggling
avant rock/jazz is not your thing, the
Good Hooch EP is being released at

(and 7" EP) feature the Bone of
Contention, Pundits, lndescision and
the Minimalist Love Gods. If you like
power pop and the like, support these
locals.

On Saturday you better not miss the
Thomas Jefferson Slave Apartments
show. Check out Bob Pomeroy's arti-
cle. ’ .
Monday, Feb. 27, Luciano’s has a
rock offering worthy of the gods. '~lt
starts at 8 p.m., so don’t be late.
Olympia, Wash.’s Kicking Giant are
taking no prisoners. Alien ID. is their
new full length LP on K Records and
gives the band a powerful arsenal for
live performance.

This duo featuring Tae Won Yu (gui-
tar/vocals) and Rachael Carns (Drums)
has an incredible, full sound that is to
be rivaled by any trio.

Carns has a Maureen Tucker sensi-
bility when it comes to drumming. Her
lyrical style must be attributed to her
past history as a pianist and xylophon-
ist. She is not afraid to smash the hell
out of her stand-up kit, but knows how
to be subtle.

Yu is a master of searing guitar
slashes, jarring Wire-esque chord
angles, and miasmatic ambiance. He
has such a diverse palette that in each
song he offers a different mixture of
guitar textures/attitudes that keep

Luciano’s Coffee House. The show .

K Records super
things fresh and dynamic. This is not
some gimmick band. Kicking Giant
communicates in‘ an almost improvisa-
tional fashion and constantly changes
arangements to keep the music excit-
ing and viable. 5

Les Batteries, a French/NYC per-
cussion duo are a good choice for an

opening act and will surely wow the

crowd with spirited drumming. Also,
locals Vehicle Flips and an unplugged
solo Karl Hendrix will perform. These
two bands have a lot of history here
and need no introductions. These acts
are nationally known and respected.
Check this show out!

'Whew!! This brings us to
Wednesday, Mar 1. At 8 pm, Luciano’s
Coffeehouse is again a hot spot'for
indie rock. Trenchmouth came to the
Pittsburgh with Jawbox a year or two
ago. They're back. This is not minimal-

ist pop/punk. Au contraire. This is a
quartet from Chicago that is influenced
by The Clash, Gang of Four and
Dischord hard core. But they're not the

"trad punk ensemble. Ska and swing

jazz have a profound influence on the
band's sound.

Baltimore's Candy Machine will also
rock ‘n’ roll and feature Jamie Panzer a
Pittsburgh punk legend, who was also
in Poison 13 (ex-Big Boys members).
New(er) local riff mongers Carradine
and a debut performance of Six-Horse
(featuring Bill Baxter of Blunderbuss
and Pat Morris, ex—Northern Bushmen,
Don Cabellero) open.

These shows are high quality, cheap,
and not put on by money-grubbing
scum. Enjoy-these fine entertainment
options. ‘

My mother wanted me to be
a doctor. _

As it goes, there's little
chance of that happening. So
to compensate for my mistake
in choice of profession and the
fact that I never watched St.
Elsewhere (I could never get
past Ed Begely Jr.’s lisp), I fig-
ured that l’d give the new
“doctor dramas” a try. Now
after seeing them I’m sure that
I made the correct decision by
not going to med school.

Chicago Hope and E.R.,
two shows that try to portray
the true nature of the medical
profession, focus on melodra-
matic characters and situa-
tions that seem to drive the
viewer away. incessant bitch-
ing and moaning prevail
throughout the hour until (a)
someone dies or (b) someone
is miraculously saved. When
the stories seem to stall the
doctors will go intosurgery,
talk medical mumbo-jumbo (it
heightens the realism, you
know) and show close-ups of

- open, bloodiedlchest cavities.

Cool. «

The differences of the shows
are mainly in the types of doc-
tors, as one features the
younger, fledgling surgeons
working the emergency room
and the other, Chicago Hope,
focuses on the cream-of-the-
crop doctors of the most pres-
tigious hospital in Chicago.
Starring Mandy Patinkin and
Adam Arkin as cutting-edge
doctors who wrestle not only
with their jobs but also with
their personal lives, Chicago
Hope tries to examine the
processes of medicine from
the point of the physician: their
ethical and moral dilemmas,
their uncanny doctor-patient
relations and the battles that
they fight for better health
care. a

What bothers me most
about this show is not the act-
ing (they’re all capable per-
formers), or even the look of
the show (although it is the
darkest hospital l’ve ever
seen), but its improbability.
What really yanks my chain is
that even though this is the
largest hospital in a huge city,
it seems like only two doctors
do every operation, and not
only every one, but every type
possible. Today everything is
specialized, every type of

cific doctor, but in Chicago
Hope the same surgeon that
performs a heart transplant
one week is separating twins
joined at the abdomen the
next. General surgeons are a
dying breed, and yet here is a
“realistic” program that, for
dramatic purposes, bends the
truth and still wants you to
accept everything else they
say.

Failing in practically all the
same ways, and more, is E.R.,
a whiny showcase of the
attractive young doctors who
must slave away inthe emer-
gency room, with tragedies
around every corner.
Consistently at the top of the
ratings (first this past week)
the show follows the lives of
poor, pathetic doctors about to
become rich, patheticones.
Anthony Edwards and George
Clooney are featured as over-
worked emergency room
physicians (they regularly
sleep at the hospital after eigh-
teen hour shifts), charming
and handsome yet extremely
one-dimensional.

E.R.’s storyline constantly
tries to create a certain
amount of empathy from tiTe

surgery doled out to one spe-

    

ations are so far removed from
the average guy or gal. The

doctors complain of being.

understaffed, of bad relations
between employees, and of
the incompetence 'of the med-
students. But when you realize
that these people are going to
be making hundreds of thou-
sands of dollars in a few
years, the interest is lessened.
Don't these people realize that
becoming a doctor takes time
and sweat? Quit your whining
and put that down payment on
the BMW!

What these shows are trying
to do is difficult, because of
the preconceived notions there

» are regarding doctors; they're

rich, snobby and uncaring
when necessary, but there are
few ways in which ER. and
Chicago Hope try to change
these ideas. In the real world,
there is still a gap between the
healer and the sick, the
wealthy and the poor, and it's
laudable as the shows‘ try to
change this, although poorly
done. Buthospitals are there
for a specific purpose; the ethi-
cal parts aren't as clear cut. I
liked doctors better when I
didn't have to hear them com-
plain.

great research...

Kaplan spends over $3 million annually developing
products and researching the tests. We've proved
that we know the tests inside out.

In 1992, Kaplan predicted the elimination
 of an LSAT question type and changed our
course in anticipation of the change.

In. 1993, the ETS was forced to
 withdraw a GRE question type because
Kaplan "broke the code."

 In 1994, Kaplan research brought to light
 security flaws in the computer-based GRE
tests. As a result, the ETS temporarily

pulled the test.

 Kaplan's expertise translates
into higher scores and greater
confidence for our students.
Put our research to work for

Do you like being tied up to a.
bed? Good. Then you must
catch Unidentified Human
Remains and the True Nature
of Loverunning right now in
the Studio Theater. lt’s not just
a peep show, so keep it down,
there is actually a little some-
thing to it besides moistening
your shorts.

The playwright, Brad Fraser,
wants us to~.find the true nature
of love, which translates into

 

‘being able to love.“ But pursu-

ing amoré in the postmodern
world is no quickiein the park,
as we all know. Fraser shad-
ows this quest for love with the
cheap cinematic tactics of vio-
lence, murder and sex. Trash
is telling enough to him without
any high art pretension.

I assume he offers us “peo-

ple fucking onstage or an 18-

year-old getting a blowjob” to
make a point about destructive
love without being the least bit
abstract. We’re just gonna
have to wait and see, big dogs,
if a good dose of sleaze can
raise our highbrow as well the
low. '

Now, Grexcordially invites
all us poor people to the Grex
Explosion beginning at 7 p.m.
They’re going to do all myriad
of funky stuff with a little music,
champagne and lots of glorious
conversations. For more info,
call-243-8927. The event is
happening Feb. 24 and 25, and
tickets only cost $25.

The New Works Festival is

panning for new scripts to be

Senior co-
copfoin swims
Iosfmeet of
Big East

By Brett Fondrk
Senior Staﬁ Writer

“Sleepless in Pittsburgh.” No,
it’s not the title of a new movie
or book, it’s- a description of the
sometimes hectic life of senior
swimmer Vicki Geubtner.

“Vicki is involved with about
everything that there is to be
involved with,” assistant coach
Julie Stein said. “I can’t imagine
her possibly doing anymore.”

A partial list of the extracur-
ricular activities that she is cur-
rently involved with just this
term is more than most students
will have on their resume in
four years. She is currently a
tutor and volunteer at Martin
Luther King Elementary school;
a volunteer at‘ Children’s
Hospital; a member of Team
Pitt, which is a group of athletes
who go to local schools to
speak; a part-time writer at The
Pitt News; and last, but not
least, taking a ballroom dancing
class.

It’s a wonder that she even
has time to paddle around in the

bathtub, let alone practice twice '

a day, keep up with her classes
and still manage be one of the
true leaders on the women’s
swim team. "

- “She’s non-stop,” head coach
Marian Cassidy Keen said. “She
typifies what a student-athlete
should be.”

“I want to do everything,”
Geubtner said. “And if I can’t

give 100 percent in all areas, it A

bothers me.”
But Geubtner has not always
personified the term student-

"athlete. There was a time, as

short as four years ago when she

' was far from the busy body that

she is today.
At William Tennent High
School in Southhampton, Pa.,

where she was a four—year letter .

winner, she found herself to be
“naturally” dominant over her
opponents. ’

It wasn’t her fault, it’s just that .
"she was able to win consistently

without ever lifting weights,
going through twice-a-day prac-
tice or doing any sort of serious
conditioning.

She wasn’t even sure how
good she was.

“I wasn’t a top swimmer, at
least I didn’t think that I was,”
she said. “At ﬁrst I didn’t think
that I was good enough to be
Division I.”

But a number of schools,
including LaSalle, Delaware
and Pitt, thought that she was.

After making a few recruiting
trips, Geubtner made the visit to
Oakland and decided from the
moment she stepped foot on
campus that she wanted to be a
Panther.

 Mitt. would be «

ﬁlled with highs and lows.

“I was just overwhelmed by
being a freshman,” she said. “I
was intimidated and very
naive.”

In that up-and-down year, she
had the best swimming times of
her career, but also had her
problems academically.

Geubtner attributes her per-
sonal bests that year to “fresh-
man excitement” because she
certainly wasn’t in shape physi-
cally.

“There were so many things
that I hadn’t done,” she said.
“The coach at the time referred
to me as raw meat because of
my lack of training. Some peo-
ple-even had the nerve to ask if I
had ever swam before.”

Stinging remarks aside, she
was also having problems in the
classroom, mostly due to the
time—consuming life of being on
the swim team. ‘

Her sophomore year she

turned things around academi-
cally, but had what she termed a
“disastrous” year swimming.

The following year was when
the athletics and academics
finally began to balance out.

She finished seventh in the 50
freestyle at last year’s Big East
Championships and also placed
in the 100 free and the back-
stroke. At the same time, she
was also making her mark in the

_ classroom.

For her efforts, her teammates
voted her the winner of the
Panther spirit award, which is
given to the athlete who “most
embodies the spirit of the team.”

She was also voted as one of
the team’s tri-captains for this
season.

“From her freshman year to
this year, she has done a total
360,,” senior Christy Knobloch
said. “She wasn’t as well-round-
ed as everyone else, and now
she is the top sprinter and leader

Busy Geubtner Wds time to swim in hectic schedule

on the team.”

“She is a tremendous leader,
both .by example and word,”
Keen said. “She’s not afraid to
stand up and be vocal. Everyone
listens because they know that
she is working just as hard if not
harder than they are.”

Geubtner hopes that she has
worked hard enough to go out
with a bang and make_this
weekend’s Big East
Championships her best ever.

“I’ve always been consistent,
but this year I’ve been giving
everything that I can. I think
that I’m in the best physical
shape of my career,” she said.
“This is my year to prove that
my freshman year wasn’t a
ﬂuke.”

“I’m looking forward to see-
ing her swim well and have a lot
of fun,” Keen said. “She’s going
to finish off a great career.
We’re really going to miss her
next year.”

The team right now is dis-
playing a kind of heart that
has been lacking in the bas-
ketball program for many
years.

After the Miami game,
Hurricane head coach
Leonard Hamilton said of this
Pitt squad, “You have to give
Pittsburgh credit. They’ve had
a lot of tough losses, and for
them to maintain their con-
centration and come out and
shoot the ball as well as they
did, it says a lot about the
character of this team.”

If a few games of bowling
can do all of this for the
Panthers, I suggest to every-
one get out to a local bowling
alley before mid-terms. You
never know, it just might help
you the way its helped the
Panther basketball team.
