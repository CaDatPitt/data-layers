It’s all downhill from there for Pitt junior Rob Keppel.

New phones get dubious reception

By Shannon Smuts
For The Pitt News

As is true with most technological
changes aimed at “improvement,“
along with added efficiency come
added problems. So it is with Pitt‘s new
phone system, which continues to
bewilder students in their attempts to
master it.

Art Shooker. director of business
services at the University of Pittsburgh.
said he feels that the change was a step
in the right direction and that it is "go-
ing surprisingly well."

The idea for the new phone system
was presented a couple of years ago
and was put into effect this semester.
The new system was opted for because
it provides more features for the same
price as Max. the old system.

First, there is a call—waiting feature.
If someone is talking on the phone.
calls can still go through. Amy Stone,
a junior, said, “My roommate is a
phone hog, and now I can receive my
calls.”- Another positive feature is the

ring system. Two rings identify an off-
campus call while one ring signals an
on—campus call.

Another positive aspect is the
authorization code. Everyone has their
own scven—digit authorization code
which they dial in addition to the
number they are calling.

Roommates receive separate bills

sixteen numbers.

“The new phone system is a pain in
the neck.“ said sophomore Susan Mor-
row. "It‘s a lot to remember."
Freshman Leslie Banks stated: “There
are too many numbers. What happens
if there’s an emergency?"

“Billing is good. Call-waiting is cool. But in general,

I don ’t like the system. ”

— Pitt junior Tracy Friedman

and are not burdened by having to
decide who made more calls. Also. as
Shooker stated. the “cost of calls to the
students is 30 percent less.” And, of
the approximately 4,000 phones.in-
stalled, only 20 do not work.
Although the positive features of the
new system are many, students have
been complaining. Some object to the
numerous numbers one has to dial in
order to make an off-campus call. One
must dial 91, his number, and then his
authorization code. The total comes to

 _

Although there have been various
complaints about the authorization
code, Shooker said “the authorization
code will remain the same?’

Another problem is that not all of the
phones have been placed on the new
phone system yet. Some still have the:
624 extensions, further confusing-

" students. Junior Tracy Friedman stated

“Billing is good. Call waiting’s cool.
But, in general, I don’t like the
system."

Two students hurt
by football player

By Bob Travers
Staff Writer

Dexter Hairston. a reserve wide
receiver on the Pitt football team. is
facing charges of aggravated and siin—
ple assault stemming from an incident
late last semester.

According to a police report.
Hairston attacked two Pitt students in
separate occurrences minutes apart on
the night of Dec. 5.

The victims were identified as Sean
Suchko and Daniel Ferrell, both 18 and
residents of the Litchfield Towers.

According to the report filed with
Oakland Police Station No. 4, Hairston
and two unidentified companions met
Suchko on the steps leading from
Forbes Avenue to the Towers dor-
mitory. The report states: “Hairston
walked up to the victim [Suchko] and
gave him a forearm to the face.
lacerating his lip. then Hairston just
walked away.”

The injured Suchko then called
police from a phone in the Towers lob-
by and “gave the description of
Hairston and advised of the assault and
direction of his [Hairston’s] flight.“

The second incident occurred in
Schenley Quad when Hairston came
across Ferrell, who was passing
through the Quad at the same time as
Hairston. The police report claims Fer-
rell “heard Hairston state ‘Watch this.’
at which time Hairston forearmed him
[Ferrell] in the face and knocked him
to the ground. Ferrell then got up and
said ‘Why did you do that to me?’
Hairston then stated ‘Do you want
some more of me?’ "

Funding:

According to the report, I-lairston hit
Ferrell a second time. splitting his lip
and breaking two front teeth. Hairston
and his companions then ﬂed to the Stu-
dent Union where they were spotted by
police officers. The three were arrested
in a Student Union rest room.

Police later learned in a check with
Montefiore Hospital that Ferrell had
three broken teeth and required eight
stitches in the mouth.

The case was turned over to local
magistrate Nicholas Diulus. In a
preliminary hearing, Diulus deter-
mined there was enough supporting
evidence to proceed with a trial.

   

Dexter Hairston

In a recent interview with The Pitt
News Ferrell said he was awaiting word
from his lawyer before he determined
what his next step would be. Ferrell
also said he was “probably” going to
press charges but cautioned that no
legal action on his part has been
decided upon as yet.

The two men with Hairston were
taken to the police station. identified
and released.

Women, minorities aided

By David Zafris
Staff Writer

Women and minorities will have a
better chance for advancement in Pitt’s
administration, according to a state-
ment issued by the Provost’s Office.
Financial support will be given to these
students and directed to affect ﬁelds
where they are most underrepresented.

“We would like to make an impact
on ﬁelds where women, minorities and
disadvantaged students are most under-
represented,” said Nancy White, as-
sistant to the provost. “The Provost‘s
Development Fund has always been
committed to helping these students,
but now we are specifically recruiting
for these kind of people.” i

The Provost’s Advisory Committee
on Women’s Concerns (PACWC)
released a study recently stating that
there are no women among the top ad-
ministrative positions at Pitt. The study
also saidthere are either no or few
tenured women in some departments.

White said the new policy concern-

ing grants is not a direct result of the
PACWC study. “It has been a continu-
ing coneem of the Provost’s Office that
these people have been under-
represented in these positions,” she
said. '

The Provost’s Development Fund is
designed to provide financial support
and develop opportunities for women,
minorities and disadvantaged students
who are U.S. citizens pursuing the doc-
torate or a professional degree within
the provost’s area and a degree which

would qualify them for an academic or V

administrative appointment.

White defined the provost’s area as
encompassing most schools at Pitt ex-
cept the health sciences. Most of the
grants are normally given to students
who are in the final stages of their doc-
toral programs, according to White.

The fund consists of $65,000 annual-
ly from a combination of university and
private funds, according to White. Ap-
plications for 1987 grants are now
available in the Office of the Provost,
801 Cathedral of Learning. Completed
applications should be returned to
White before March 1986.

U.S.: Iran’s search of ship legal

The State Department announced
yesterday that Iran was within its rights
when it stopped and searched a U.S.
merchant ship for weapons bound for
Iraq. The White House indicated that
Iran may have acted legally under rules
of naval warfare in detaining the Presi-
dent Taylor in the Gulf of Oman last
Sunday. The State Department studied
a report on the incident from the U.S.
embassy in Abu Dhabi and has decided
the case is closed. No further action
will be taken.

Anti-Americanism
blamed on U.S.

Britain‘s top NATO officer said
Americans themselves are at least part-
ly to blame for a wave of anti-
Americanism that is sweeping through
Europe. General Sir Thomas Morony
said anti—Americanism is reaching what
he terms “distasteful levels.” He said
the current U.S. propaganda war with
the Soviet Union. especially over “Star
Wars." is a major factor. He warned.
however. that Europeans must not
underestimate the importance of U.S.
contributions to peace.

Tutu receives
honorary degree

Bishop Desmond Tutu received an
honorary law degree from Temple
University yesterday and praised the
school for being the first American col-
lege to divest itself of stock in com-
panies doing business in South Africa.
The 54-year-old Nobel Prize winner
also said that all people are interde-
pendent and until black South Africans
are free there is no freedom orjustice
in South Africa.

Paraphrasing Martin Luther King
Jr.. Tutu went on to say. “We have
been to the mountaintop. We too have
been to the promised land. And we. all
of us. black and white. must hold hands
with God as we strive into the great
future that will open up in front of us.”

Tutu. the bishop of Johannesburg,
won the 1984 Nobel Prize for Peace for
his non—violent fight to end apartheid.
Some 22‘ million blacks in South
Africa. or about 70 percent of the
population. have no political rights and
cannot vote. All political power is held
by the white minority, which accounts
for some 18 percent of the population.

Chemist
receives
awards

Dennis P. Curran, assistant professor
of chemistry at Pitt. has recently been
nalned a Camille and Henry Dreyfus
Teacher—Scholar and has received a
Merck Grant for Faculty Development.

The Dreyfus Teacher—Scholar grant
was established in 1969 at the request
of Dreyfus Foundation President Jean
Dreyfus Boisswain. It is a one—time.
$50,000 award that is given to academ-
ic institutions for the benefit of young.
exceptional faculty members who com-
bine interest and demonstrated ex-
cellence in teaching and performing
imaginative research. These funds are
to be used to develop teaching and
scholastic potentials.

The Merck Grant. a $ 12.000 award.
was established by Merck & Co.. Inc.
for professional career development in
the performance of basic research that
actively contributes new knowledge in
biomedical sciences. The Committee of
Senior Research Chemists of the Merck
Sharp & Dohme Research Laboratories
recommended Curran for his grant.

Shortly after Curran joined the Pitt
chemistry faculty in April 1981. he was
awarded the $25.000 Dreyfus Newly
Appointed Young Faculty in Chemistry
Grant to be used as seed money to
foster new ideas and concepts in
research pursuits. In December 1984
he was awarded the $l5.000 Eli Lilly
Grant and in February 1985 the Alfred
P. Sloan Fellowship that is presented
in recognition of quality research pro-
grams.

Student Apathy

It used to be, in a time not so long ago, that col-
lege campuses across America stank of political ac-
tivism. Droves of fresh—faced youths, made giddy
by their idealistic naivete, collectively crusaded to
crush the forces of oppression wherever they might
appear (and in those days they popped—up
everywhere; why it seemed that every institution
we were ever taught to cherish was, in reality, in
the terrible grip of duplicitous fascists furtively plot-
ting to waylay every honest American citizen). But
that’s all past, or at least we no longer ﬁnd such
zeal at the University of Pittsburgh.

Perhaps social justice is still of great concern to
students of other colleges and universities —
perhaps not. But at Pitt, very few fight for the pro-
tection of human rights.

A case in point is the failure of Pitt students to
provide substantial support for the campus organiza-
tion Students For a Free South Africa. The South
African government’s policy of apartheid is
arguably the vilest form of social control presently
in existence. Yet Pitt students find that the exer-
tion necessary to press university administrators to
divest current holdings in ﬁrms doing business with
South Africa is, shall we say, inconvenient.

Its a shame we, the educated and aware, have
become so shallow, callous and indolent that we no
longer become indignant when confronted with
social injustice. No longer guided by our principles,
our courage has been sapped by an enervating
apathy. While the excesses of political activists can
at times be laughable (charmingly so), their efforts
are admirable if only for their ardent, sincere con-
cern. We, on the other hand, are not only laughable,
but our shoddy indifference has made us somewhat
contemptible as well. Even our charm has
vanished, if you will.

disappointed to note that The Pitt News
of Jan. 6 carried an article by Dan
Bates with the same misinformation.

Except for the enhanced decor. there
is no apparent difference between Mer-
cy’s program and the Birthing Suite at
Magee—Womens Hospital, not to men-
tion numerous other OB specialty
hospitals across the United States.
Magee—Womens has had such accom-
modations since the mid-l970s and in
1982 opened a specially designed birth-
ing suite containing or adjacent to the
most sophisticated life support equip-
ment available and highly trained ex-
perts to use it. Although there are many
differences between Magee’s and Mer-
cy’s OB services, one of the most im-
portant is Magee's unmatched capabil-
ities in normal and high-risk OB care
which would be critical to a mother and
baby in the event of complications. To
imply this level of care exists elsewhere
in Pittsburgh does the public a tremen-
dous disservice.

The news media often have been
remiss in thoroughly reporting health
care issues. Their accuracy is com-
promised by a lack of medical under-
standing, the confusion created by
hospitals competing for headlines and

their failure to identify appropriate
sources of information. But with regard
to LDR or any story involving
women‘s health, The Pitt News, part

Pitt Skinny— Dips In Sun City

The board of trustees have very
clearly violated the decencies of con-
structive progress by refusing con-
cerned individuals their portfolio of in-
vestment in companies with holdings
in South Africa. Before joining the
chorus howling for the fall of South
Africa and divestment, without quali-
fication, let‘s look at all sides of the
question and explore the possible rami-
fications involved if action proves ill-
timed or hasty.

Investment means inﬂuence, but it
can also mean support and approval.
The so-called Sullivan Principles, con-
sidered the hallmark of constructive
engagement, are worthless because
while calling for the end of discrimina-
tion in the workplace. they do not in-
sist on equal pay and full citizenship
for competent blacks. This, therefore,
is obfuscation, not constructive engage-
ment. The university must answer to
its student body, many of them black.
for such evil duplicity as support for
South Africa.

Consider the amount of revenue gen-

erated by black athletes. It seems very
evident that this money can never be

morally invested in a government re-
fusing blacks equal citizenship.
American military personnel are fre-
quently refused entry into South Africa
because of their skin color. I’ve heard
many adjectives, “appalling,“
“abominable," “pathetic" and so on.
which accurately capture the appropri-
ate indignation.

A policy of assimilation is what real
constructive engagement could have
been. It could have been the response
of investors to insist on breaking South
African law by calling for citizenship
and for full rights for blacks they
employ. It could have been the policy
to insist on timetables and quotas for
the assimilation of a fixed percentage
of black citizens, to gradually
assimilate and train a black middle
class, thus abolishing apartheid while
creating conditions to shield white
South Africans from reverse discrimi-
nation. something which no one
deserves. However, they have no one
but themselves to blame if it should
come about.

South Africa didn‘t have to impose

u:i‘4 )5-: v'.‘3.:.-. _c-'5',-',,. i. .. ._- _s_s':‘1I_‘,4 '-+,n.suJ-._.=vf_

migration into arid townships, lower-
ing the already imperiled standard of
living of the majority. This is the very
policy which the Reagan administration
criticizes in Marxist Ethiopia, but when
racists do it, then we are silent. It seems
to be the policy of conservatives in this
country to assume that morality is
useless and that inconsistency is a
foregone conclusion.

The University of Pittsburgh has no
right to invest in a country of such sur-
passingly immoral convictions. That
they do so anyway is a slap in the face
to every self-respecting student, pro-
fessional and employee of the univer-
sity, not to mention the city of Pitts-
burgh and the human race in general.
The fallacy of the Sullivan Principles
have been found out to be the hollow
words of ill-doers.

Student power has declined through
‘disuse over the years; but given the
facts. it seems implausible that the
students would support the bold ar-
rogance and corruption of the board of
trustees when they invest in a country
of such venom and evil South Africa.

Beyond Reason/Matthew Tolbert

Student Finds University’s Com

I want to be the first person to of-
ficially complain about the new cam-
pus phone system.

Last weekend I returned from
Christmas break and started trying to
call up friends using their easy-to-
remember four-digit phone numbers.
What happened? Twenty rings on my
first call and no answer. OK. I thought,
the guy isn '1 in. I proceeded to call
another person. Same ring count. Dit-
to on my third call attempt. I became
suspicious. “What," I yelled at my
roommates, “is the problem with our
phone?“ A

“New phone system,” they re-
sponded. “Everyone on campus has

Now that I know something about
both movies, I can say that they share
the theme that the Russians are inex-
plicably evil — cartoon characters who
do bad for the sake of doing bad. In
“Rambo." for instance, the Russians
and the North Vietnamese together
hold American prisoners of war long
after the war is over and all POWs are
said to have been sent home. They hold
these poor. unfortunate men for no
reason except that they choose to do so.
This is the way it is with evil people.

My roommate had plastered this big

I scanned down its phone numbers ‘til
I came to “STS Service Office.“ I gave

No one answered. What service.

I then called “Telecommunications”
and got a response. “I need to call my

“Try calling Housing." she
responded politely. “They can help

“Great. But what is Housings

“I am not sure. It's a new number,”
she mumbled, and went off to find it
for me.

I got Housing’s number and gave
them a call. “I need a number." I
asked.

of people seem convinced that the

holding American prisoners of war and

You will not get this columnist to de-

nists. but he would be hard—pressed to
explain why anyone — even a (ugh!)

the end ofthe war. After all. that would
have to be an expensive proposition

“Oh. you‘ll have to call the operator
for that number."

"How do I get the operator?“

“Just dial '0.‘ “

I called “O“ and waited. Twenty

I waited half an hour. then called
again and got the operator. “I need a
new number from an old number," I
said.

“What building?“

“The Cathedral of Learning.“

“Their numbers haven‘t changed
yet. You can still use your old
number."

Ifthe unnecessary hassle I had to go
through just for an on-campus call was
frustrating. off—campus calling had to
be worse. I tried calling my folks col-
lect. Couldn‘t get through. “You need
your password," my roommates told
me.

You don‘t have to be Rambo incarnate
to suggest that the proper American
response to such a discovery should be
something close to war itself. By now
it would be counterproductive for
anyone to keep American POWs alive.

This logic finds a hostile reception
among those who are genuinely con-
vinced of the genetic evil of commu-
nists or (a kind of evil itself) those who
would use the bogeyman of the satanic
communist to advance certain foreign
policy goals. A vigorously conducted
anti—communist foreign policy is all the
more vigorous. not to mention amply
funded, if the enemy is demonized.
Among other things itjustifies a policy
in. which leftist insurgencies are
deemed bad. rightist ones good and no
attempt is made to differentiate among
them. We must fund the Contras in
Nicaragua and Jonas Savimbi in
Angola for the same reason: They both
fight the devil.

I searched through the papers sent to

went down on Sunday to the STS of-

my dorm room. only to be told by my
roommates. “You can go to the

I have heard some nasty rumors
about Pitt’s new phone system. Rumors
like “AT&T used to give us 60 per-

“Local calls can cost up to 13 cents a

hike. Rumors like, “The only reason
they give us passwords is so they know
who to bill more.“ Rumors like “The
only people who are getting any pluses
out of this new phone system are the
people collecting the bills.” Obviously
STS has a communication problem
with Pitt’s students on what is fact and
what is fiction about their phones.

I liked the old simple ways of using
Pitt's phones. I didn‘t mind the 91 ex-

lies Of MIAS Are Victimized Once Again

families of the 2.441 MIAs from the
Vietnam War are real. Having been
victimized once by the war. they are
being victimized yet again by politi-
cians and "patriotic" actors who. for
reasons ofthcir own. sell hope the way
religious charlatans sell pieces of the
true cross. The families are told of
“sightings" of Americans and their
own government is accused of with-
holding the truth — although why it
should do so is never explained. This
is Ronald Reagan’s government. isn‘t
it?

Diligently. the government has gone
about the business of trying to account
for the MIAs. Even now. a U.S. dele-
gation is in Vietnam and others have
been there before. The task is as end-
less as it is hopeless. There are MIAs
after all wars. but those of Vietnam are
a bit different. In life they were used
to tight communists. In death. they are
used to fight reason. .

Group raises funds

for child’ s

By Jack Burkman
Staff Writer

Pitt’s International Student Organiza-
tion has recently been engaged in
various efforts to raise money for a
young Brazilian boy's liver transplant.

Two—year—old Victor Pexe is current-
ly on the waiting list for donor organs
at Children‘s Hospital. According to
club president Lisa Machado, the boy’s
family could be left with over $160,000
in medical costs if and when the
surgery is finally performed.
Machado’s organization is attempting
to mitigate these costs.

“We began our project during
Homecoming.  At present, we have
in mind a party at Zelda’s." said
Machado. “We’lI also collect money
at the door as donations for the little
boy. Also, our group is selling coupon
books; approximately one-third of this
revenue will be proﬁt and given to the
boy.”

Machado said an excess of $1,000
has already been placed in a special
bank account in the child’s name which
is designed solely to pay for his upcom-
ing operation.

Michelle Bowman, who is also a
member of Pitt‘s International Student

transplant

Organization, points out that fund
raisers are currently underway in
Pexe‘s home region in Brazil.
“Various Brazilian singers and dancers
have donated their time," she said.
“Anonymous Brazilians have made
donations as well."

Bowman, who speaks Portuguese.
has also helped the boy’s family with
language problems. “I was in Brazil
through the Latin American Studies
Program.  There, I met his [Victor
Pcxe‘s] aunt. Later. I met the family
in Pittsburgh," she said. “Since then.
I ‘ve been helping with the translation.”

Bowman also transported some of
the family’s personal belongings from
Brazil to Pittsburgh.

The boy, though on the hospital’s
waiting list and scheduled to receive
treatment regardless of any post-
surgery ﬁnancial considerations, is
unable to receive treatment until an
organ can be located.

“Once a suitable liver donor has
been found. then they‘ll proceed with
the transplant," said Children‘s
Hospital Spokesman Mary Ann
Zerence.

Surgeons scheduled to perform the
operation could not be reached for
comment on the boy’s speciﬁc medical
condition. Zerence, however, did say
that Pexe was classed as an out—patient.

The Pitt News. January 15. 1986

Features Editor

Ann started smoking for something
to do: “When I came to college. all of

my friends smoked, so I started just .

because I was bored and wanted
something to do."

Kris was rebelling. “I started
smoking by accident. because I was
trying to spite a friend.” said junior
Kris Weil, who is presently up to a
pack of Virginia Slims a day. “I was
mad at him and I knew he hated
smoking.”

Jay was trying to fit in. “I started
smoking when I was 14,” said Savucci,
a junior, who recently quit the habit.
“My friends smoked. It was the thing
to do, a way to be part of the crowd.”

Whether the reason for starting is
rebellion, conformity, fashion or a
reaction to stress, cigarette smoking has
grown casually into what the U.S.
Department of Health, Education and
Welfare describes as “the largest
preventable cause of death in
America,” as well as a medical, social
and economic institution. Last year,
about 53 million people in the United
States smoked; that’s 640 billion
cigarettes a year. Eighty—five percent
of the nation’s smokers would like to
quit — only 2 million a year actually
do.

Although it is difficult to point to a
single cause of smoking, most of the
evidence indicates that the majority of
cigarette smoking begins in the teen-
age years and develops into a lifelong
addiction. The impetus is usually peer
pressure. This was the case for Mark
Dunn, a sophomore psychology major.
He began smoking at age 14. “I started
smoking because everyone else did,”
said Dunn. “It was the cool thing to
do.”

In a close-knit environment such as
college, the effects of peer pressure are
magnified.

“Peer pressure is probably the big-
gest reason that people start smoking, ’ ’
said Cora Deloyia, public relations
director for the Pittsburgh branch of the
American Cancer Society. “In a col-
lege setting, there is a lot of social life,
fraternity parties, bars; and where there
is a lot of social life, there is a lot of
smoking.”

Dunn has noticed this: “I think the
college environment encourages
smoking. I live with three people and
two smoke. Then you go to a bar, and
everyone is smoking.”

Another factor that figures into the
decision to begin smoking is media im-
age. “When you are trying to find
yourself in your life, career, lifestyle,
you can identify yourself more quick-
ly with media images." said American
Cancer Society health educator Darlene
Kerr. “Young smokers are more
susceptible to this type of media iden-
tification. According to the tobacco
companies, the way that cigarettes are
advertised is to encourage consumers
to buy certain types of cigarettes in
order to create a certain type of identi—
t .”
yDunn does not think he associates
cigarettes with image. “I smoke
Marlboro and I don’t consider myself
[as] succumb[ing] to the Marlboro Man
image,” said Dunn. “I smoke them
because I like the taste. I’ve tried a lot
of different brands and that is the one
I like best.”

Ann, who asked not to be identified
because she did not want her parents
to know she is smoking, believes that
image has a lot to do with cigarettes.

“I see a lot of different images
associated with cigarette smoking. but
most of them are associated with a
liberated, more outgoing type of per-
son," said Ann. who smokes between
four and five packs of Benson Hedges
per week. “I would never smoke
Marlboros. Its a male. macho
cigarette. There are people who smoke
just for image and because they think
it‘s cool -— but the real smokers don‘t. "

“I don’t think anyone wants to ad-
mit that they are affected by image and
media, but I think it has a lot to do with
it." said Josh Dinman. who has been
smoking Marlboros since he was 18.
“I started smoking Marlboros because
my roommate smoked them. and I have

C

seen all of the advertisements; they
have probably inﬂuenced me in some
way.”

According to Dave Kennedy, who
manages the Unimart in Oakland. the
media images of cigarettes are often
consistent with the type of people who
purchase them. Kennedy sells over
1,400 packs of cigarettes per week.
most of them to college students.

“You can usually tell who is going
to buy what when they walk in,” said
Kennedy. “There are deﬁnite male and
female cigarettes. The women usually
smoke the lighter, menthol cigarettes
like Virginia Slims or Salem Lights.
Men smoke Marlboro and Newports."

Stress is another cause of smoking
that is aggravated in a college setting.
Smoking, for many, calms the nerves
and relaxes the muscles.

“I started smoking to relax my
nerves,” said Regina Hofmann, who
began smoking in September and is
presently smoking two or three packs

Another area which Perkins and Ep-
stein are examining is smoking in rela-
tion to metabolism. This experiment,
which is currently in the pilot study
stages, examines the nicotine and
metabolism levels and the changes over
the course of a few weeks as a person
tries to quit smoking. So far, the study
seems to support the notion that
smoking cigarettes induces weight loss.
“The vast majority of calories are
burnt up at rest,” said Perkins, “[with]
2/3 calories used just to keep the organs
working. Much of the research so far
seems to indicate that there’ is
something other than food intake in-
volved in gaining weight after one stops
smoking."

The research that Perkins and Ep-
stein have conducted thus far is testing
the differences between smokers and
nonsmokers to see if smokers actually
do have higher metabolism rates, and
what the rates are like in people who
quit smoking.

“When you are trying to ﬁnd yourself in your life,
career, lifestyle you can identify yourself more quickly
with the media images. Young smokers are more suscep-
tible to this type of media identiﬁcation.

of Kool Mild 1005 per week. “The
pressure of school was getting to me.
I needed some kind of outlet for my
nervous energy."

However, according to a study per-
formed last summer by Dr. Ken
Perkins and Dr. Leonard Epstein of
Western Psychiatric Institute and
Clinic, physical reactions to stress and
psychological reactions do not always
mesh. Nicotine. which is the main drug
in cigarettes. is a stimulant that works
to increase the heart rate. “When peo-
ple smoke to relieve stress.
psychologically they feel more relaxed.
but internally the cardiovascular activi-
ty is actually increased." said Perkins.

Perkins and Epstein are currently
planning a study that focuses on peo-
ple who smoke under stress. and why
some people are less able to adapt to
stress. “Stress without smoking is an
entirely different situation from stress
with smoking." said Perkins.
“Smokers are less able to adapt to
stress compared to someone who deals
with stress without smoking."

“People continue to smoke so they
won't gain weight,” said Perkins.
"And even if they do stop the weight
gain, the effects of smoking are much
more harmful than any gain in
weight."

But health concerns do not seem to
be a pressing deterrent to young
smokers. “They know it isn’t good for
their health, butjust knowing [that] is
not enough," said Janet Devoe, who
directs Pitt’s Fresh Start program.

Kerr agreed: “When you talk about
smoking to someone who is still young.
the idea of developing lung cancer in
their 60s and dying in their early 60s
instead of late 70s is not particularly
meaningful."

The health threats of cigarette
smoking have been devastating and
much publicized. Last year. for exam-
ple. there were 320.000 smoking-
related deaths. Most of the effects have
been revealed in the nation's cancer
rates. According to the Surgeon
General‘s Report. cigarette smoking is
the largest single cause of cancer mor-

Campus Beat
pressure induces lifelog addiction

tality in the United States, about 30 per-
cent of deaths overall, and 83 percent
of documented lung cancers. Heart at-
tacks are another smoking-induced ill-
ness, and the American Heart Associa-
tion estimates that about 25 percent of
all fatal heart attacks each year are
caused by smoking.

The hazard in cigarette smoking is
produced by the main drug and alkaloid
poison of tobacco-nicotine. This drug
acts on the body as a stimulant and pro-
duces the smoke by—product. tar, which
contains several poisonous chemicals
as well as large dose of carbon
monoxide.

The health hazards associated with
low-tar-and-nicotine cigarettes are
equally high, since the tar and nicotine
are often replaced with a variety of
ﬂavoring compounds which are also
toxic or carcinogenic.

Even if you do not smoke, if your
household members smoke, you could
also be at risk. Although the effects of
passive smoking are still a matter of
dispute, according to a recent Japanese
study the amount of cigarette smoke in-
haled for a 40-cigarette—per-day
household is equivalent to the active
smoking of a light smoker (someone
who smokes less than three cigarettes
per day).

The issue of passive smoking has
spilled from the laboratories into the
courtrooms, with many cities, towns,
companies and corporations establish-
ing anti-smoking policies.

San Francisco, for example, has one
of the nation’s most stringent anti-
smoking laws. The law went into ef-
fect in March of 1983. despite a pro-
smoking drive supported by $1.2
million from the tobacco industry.
Under this law, employers are required
LU ueveiop a smoking policy that allows
a nonsmoker to object to smoking in
the workplace. If the employer is
unable to find an adequate solution.
smoking must be banned.

A similar smoking regulation bill is
currently in the Pennsylvania House of
Representatives. The bill restricts
smoking in public areas and ‘calls for
designated smoking and non—smoking
areas to be set up in buildings.

Other anti-smoking activities have
materialized in the recent establishment
of a new series of health warnings ap-
pearing on cigarette packages — warn-
ings like "Smoking causes lung cancer.
heart disease. emphysema and may
complicate pregnancy:" or “Quitting

smoking now greatly reduces risks to
your health.” These warnings are the
softer versions of drafts that associated

smoking with “Addiction, death and‘
miscarriage, ” that the tobacco ifidustry‘

battled against.

Various anti-smoking activists have
also called for an increase in federal
cigarette tax in an effort to discourage
smoking. Currently, the federal
cigarette tax yields about $4.6 billion
a year. The Office of Technology
Assessment estimated last year that
smoking-related diseases resulted in
medical costs between $12 and $35
billion.

According to Kerr, the rising cost of
cigarettes does have an efffect on
college-aged smokers. “Young
smokers and new smokers are more
susceptible to prices,” said Kerr. “If
prices go up. often they will stop.
Established smokers will find a way to
juggle their funds and keep smoking. ”

But especially with young smokers,
smoking is more of a habit than an ad-
diction, and can be more easily ter-
minated. Pitt’s own Fresh Start pro-
gram runs once a term and according
to Devoe, has about a 20-percent suc-
cess rate. The group addresses students
and professors as well, and works in
both an individual and group format to
encourage quitting while promoting the
proper diet and medication needed to
secure the process.

“Most people that come to the pro-
gram are trying to quit for health
reasons. They finally realize what
smoking has done to their bodies," said
Devoe. “Another reason is control.
They do not like the control that
cigarettes have on their lives.”

“I feel like my smoking habit is an
expression of a weakness,” said Hof-
mann. “An addiction is a weakness,
something you can't control. I don't
like the lack of control.”

Dunn has tried to quit before. “I’ve
already quit, usually for periods of
about six months.“ But my friends
smoke, so I always end, up going
back.” said Dunn. .“I need to quit
again, though. You can tell when you
run up two ﬂights of stairsand you
can’t breathe.”‘ ‘ " A

Ann is also planning on quitting 
some day. “I feel that I‘m addicted. but
I could quit." said Ann. "I want to quit
because it's something I want to do.
though. not because it‘s something that
someone else wants me to do. or
something that I have to do."

By David Zuchowski

The hit musical Zorba, starring An-
thony Quinn, will play here at the Syria
Mosque as part of its encore national
tour. There will be nightly perfor-
mances at 8 p.m. Tuesday—Saturday.
January 14-19, and matinees at 2 p.m.
on Wed., Sat. and Sun.

The story centers on Zorba, the
Greek peasant who strikes up an ac-
quaintance with Niko, a shy young stu-
dent. Intent on teaching the young man
thejoy of “seizing the moment," Zor-
ba joins his friend on a ramble of ex-
periences throughout Greece. The tale
of one man’s robust passion for living
life to the fullest won popularity first
as Kazantzakis’ novel in 1953. The film
version, directed by Michael Cacoyan-
nis, followed in 1965. The Broadway
musical opened at the Imperial Theatre
in Nov. 1968.

Quinn’s credits include two
Academy Awards for the movies Viva
Zapata and Lust for Life. Other major
film credits include La Strada, The
Guns of Navarone, Lawrence of
Arabia, Wild as the Wind, The Shoes
of the Fislzerman, Requiem for a

Surfing at Pitt becomes possibility

By Nancy Quick
Staff Writer

Peter Petropolus has a vision. All his
friends say he’s out of his mind. His
mother doesnt take him seriously. But
Peter won‘t be discouraged.

"All my friends say. you‘re cra-
zy.‘ " said Petropolus. “ Last night.
I was talking on the phone to one friend
about my plans. and he said. ‘What?
You're nuts!‘ "

Petropolus sees the day when the
University of Pittsburgh will sponsor
its own surfing club. Despite Penn-
sylvania’s unfavorable geographic and
climatic realities and Pittsburgh’s ob-
vious lack of a surfing culture.
Petropolus is determined to make the
club work.

"were only six hours away from
the ocean,“ Petropolus said. "You can
overcome these minLite obstacles."

The minute obstacles are many. At-
tracting potential club members with a
road trip to Atlantic City in February
could be less than effective. Petropolus.
however. has already thought of that.

"Winter—surfing with wet suits is
always an option." he explained. “I
have connections in Ocean City. where
everybody on the trip can get a wet suit
for free."

Petropolus hopes to expand member-
ship and increase his club‘s activities
by including windsurfers and
skateboarders in the organization.

“But positively no water-skiers," he
stresses. “Pitt has a ski club. There are
enough skiers around here already."

But sitting around a keg planning a
surfing club and actually organizing a
university—sponsored group are not the
same thing, as Petropolus and his
fellow surfing advocates soon
discovered.

“I’ve got a pile of forms to fill out,”
he said. “I have to write up a purpose
for the organization and requirements
for membership, then turn it in to the
university.”

A veteran Student Government
Board member of 3 years, Petropolus
said his experience has prepared him
well for the challenge. “The only prob-
lem I foresee is finding a faculty ad-
visor," he said. “I may be appealing
to the masses to find a faculty member
who surfs."

Petropolus encourages everyone to
act on their ideas as he has done and
to pursue them no matter how
preposterous they may seem.

"It’s not that difficult to start an
organization,” he said, “as long as you
have a purpose.”

Petropolus found the purpose for a
University of Pittsburgh surf club in
Ocean City. Md., last summer.

“My friends and I were standing
around one day, and we saw this crazy-
looking kind of car. It looked like a

blown—up station wagon. and it had the
words ‘University of Maryland Surf
Team’ printed in huge letters across its
side," he said. “I said, ‘If the Univer-
sity of Maryland can have a surf team,
why can’t Pitt have a surf club?!’ But
it was just talk back then.”

What was once just talk will soon be
reality when Petropolus and his friends
organize the club’s first meetings.
Petropolus talks of at least 10 charter
members and expects that number to
double almost immediately. In lieu of
an actual road trip, which Petropolus
plans to have one or two times a year,
the club will sponsor alternate surfing-
related activities: “We’ll sit around and
talk about surfing,” he said.

Potential surfing club members may
find themselves unable to afford much
more than enlightened conversation,
considering the cost of equipment,
transportation and beach lodging re-
quired to make a road trip. According
to Petropolus, a good used surf board
could cost $150 to $200. As far as a
new board. he said, “The sky’s the
limit.”

Never fear, though. Petropolus said
he and his friends would be willing to
lend their own boards to novice club
members for instructional purposes
only.

“It isn’t a good idea as a rule to let
others use your board." he explained.
“The boards are very fragile. and in-
experienced surfers could break

them."

Petropolus does not see surfboard
loaning as a problem. however. He said
once a person starts surfing, he will
want to go out and buy a board of his
own.

“During the off-season, we can take
the club to skateboard parks,“
Petropolus eontinued,“although I think
most of the skateboard parks near here
have been shut down. We’ll have to in-
vestigate. "

Petropolus understands that his plan
to organize a surﬁng club is an unusual
one. He knows not everyone is going
to take him seriously.

“I’ve heard those jokes,” he said.
“I’ve heard everything. My friends
make cracks about the bathtub. Even
my mom said something about using
my equipment as an ironing board."
He‘s even heard the one about catching
a wave on the Allegheny River.

“You have to be casual about these
things and learn to take criticism," he
said. “Like I always say, if Pitt foot-
ball doesn't do any good next season.
we can always use the stadium as a
skateboard park.”

Peter Petropolus has a vision that ex-
tends oeyond the radical and unconven-
tional University of Pittsburgh surf
club. Peter Petropolus’ vision includes
a personal goal. “I‘m not that good or
anything." he said. “but I have a goal.
I want to be the first chubby surfer on
the world circuit."

The "Great March"

“\\\ \

By Kelly I. Shaffer
Assistant Features Editor

The young have the ability to bring
lofty idealist sentiments down to abrupt
reality, and they have a way of saying
something so simple, yet so moving,
that it incites adults to action.

Such was the case, when David Mix-
ner’s seven-year-old niece told him that
she was going to die in a nuclear war
before growing up. The statement in-
duced an operation of mammoth pro-
portions.

Mixner began organizing the Great
Peace March which will cover 13 states
and involve over 5,000 people. The
march will begin in March and extend
through December. following a route
across the United States. The goal of
the march is to protest against nuclear
armament.

“Never before in my 25 years of
organizing has anything come together
this easily. Optimism. idealism, energy
~ there’s more than enough to carry
this thing through," said Mixner.

ProPeace, the organizing body
behind the cross—country march. sees
the mission as one to inform, revive
and influence. The trek. including 16
major cities, will reach out to the coun-
tryside and tell the people of the
possibility and subsequent results of
nuclear war.

“The march will revive hope in the
world that one person can prompt some
change in the world. There will be a
great sacrifice going on. People will be
leaving their homes and jobs for eight-
and—a-half-months," said Peter
Kleiner. Public Relations Director for
ProPeace. “It’s not easy, but it is possi-
ble. If you’re committed, the march
across the nation will make a statement
about how strongly people feel about
nuclear disarmament."

Kleiner also hopes that the project
will inﬂuence governing officials to ban
nuclear arms. “We want to present the
disarmament issue as one to be reck-
oned with. In the past. people haven't
stood up forissues; now they are.
Politicians will have to deal with it on
a national and local scale.”

According to march founder. David
Mixner, “Members of Congress have
made it very clear that nothing will
happen to dramatically affect the arms
race until there is. literally, a citizen
uprising.” Mixner hopes that the
ma-rch will revive people's hope in
themselves and the world. i

This “revival”is logistically a-
stounding. They will recruit 5.000
marchers “to provide a show of
solidarity." said John l-ladleberg. the
coordinating marcher and in the Corn-
munications Department of ProPeace.

“We had to change our original
policy of having 5.000 marchers for the
whole eight months. There will be
2.500 people leaving the Los Angeles
Colosseum on March 1. By the time we
reach Denver. 81 days later. the force
will be up to the full 5,000." said
Hagelberg.

This change in plan is being at-
tributed to logistics. “We want to be
as organized as possible. By holding off
until Denver. we will be better
prepared to handle the whole group.
Hopefully by then we will have worked
out all the snags," said Hagleberg.

With 5,000 marchers. 2,500 tents,
3.825.000 meals and approximately
1,275,000 showers taken daily. the
possible snags could be overwhelming.
It is estimated that 40,000 shoes will
be worn out during the 3.235 mile hike.

The walkers will have most
everything provided for them. They
will get up in the morning and eat
breakfast in a‘ cafeteria tent in one of
the six traveling tent towns. The diet
planned for the hikers is varied. but
will provide for the stress of the
l5—mile—a—da_v hikes. Along the road.
the marchers will be able to tune in
their portable stereos to a ProPeace
radio station. that will provide the day‘s
march and weather information along
with the news of. the outside world and

Staff Writer

As March 1 rolls around. 5.000 peg
ple will don their walking shoes and

‘ trek across the country in the name of

peace — ProPeace. Seven months after
they depart from Los Angeles and two
months before they reach Washington,
D.C., they will find themselves in
America’s No. 1 city, Pittsburgh.
The reason for the 3,000-mile
journey is to support world disarma-
ment — a big task and thus a big
march. Some of the other cities the
marchers will be passing through in-
clude Las Vegas, Denver, Omaha,
Chicago, New York City, and finally
Washington, D.C. 4

“By the publicity we ’ll get
by marching across the
United States, we hope to
create a steamroller effec‘?
and build a motivating force
for multilateral disarma-

ment. ” .
Larry Evans
Pennsylvania ’s March
Coordinator

Larry Evans, Pennsylvania‘s march
coordinator, says that “By the publicity
we’ll get by marching across the United
States. we hope to create a steamroller

effect and build a motivating force foil

multi-lateral disarmament. We want to
get America motivated for peace. We
are giving the world's leaders permis-
sion to act in a radically different way
with their nuclear arsenals.

“By the time the march gets here.
I think people will be slightly over-
whelmed at the size of the march,"
continued Evans on his expectations of
the mareh’s arrival in Pittsburgh. “It’ll
be on a bit ofa roll and will be pretty
well established because of the media
coverage we will be getting as it passes

through the larger cities.“ said Evanzg. 2 5

The marchers should reach Pitts-
burgh sometime between Sept. 22 and
Sept. 24. They will march through the
North Side to Market Square, where
there will be a large peace rally. After-

entertainment.

At the end of the day’s hike, the
walkers can turn their backpacks into
folding chairs and relax in the brightly
decorated camps. In each city. the
traveling towns will be decorated with
works by the local artists. Solar-heated
showers are being provided for the
road—weary marchers, as well as the
ProPeace post office, bank and store.
Frequently, a “Roadside Peace Show“
will be available to entertain the
marchers.

The ProPeace movement has en-
couraged students to talk to their
universities about accreditation for the
time spent on the march. “Since one-
third to one-forth of the marchers are
college students, we will provide a lot
of educational programs,” said
Kleiner. “Also, students should talk to

‘ their academic advisors about indepen—

dent study credits for the march.
Perhaps a sociology student might do
a project on ‘Small Group and Com-
munity Interaction.’ For example, a
psychology major might, study the
stress and physical impact of the
march. Of course. political science
students could pursue an independent
study. on the effects of the nuclear arms
race, government policies or a
historical overview of the nuclear arms
race.

At this time, only the University of
Colorado has offered accreditation for
the march. They will accept four
credits for the timespent on the march.
However, other universities might be
able to work out project, or indepen—
dent study credits.

The different events and the march
itself will require as much funding as
planning. The fund-raising began on
Nov. 3, 1985, with a 10-kilometer
peacewalk held on 65 campuses across
the United States. The monies raised
by the students will be used to provide
the tents for the Great Peace March.

“Individuals have been sending us
donations of $1 to $10. Also, corpora-
tions have been donating either money
or goods that are needed for the march.
We have also asked outside corpora-
tions to handle the merchandising of T-
shirts and souvenirs,” said Kleiner. So
far, ProPeace has received and spent
over $3 million.

In addition to the financial needs of
the march, ProPeace has recruited a
staff of 100 in the national office. as
well as 150 volunteers. Each of the
cities visited by the marchers has set
up regional offices, not including the
volunteers on campuses involved in the
planning of the march.

The organizers of the march have
allowed positions of temporary par-

ticipants, who can march for a
minimum of two weeks. “Some peo-
ple, early on, were very excited about
the march, but had unavoidable com-
mitments,” said Hagleberg. “It’s a
positive thing when people are willing
to give of their time to such a cause.
We want to involve as many people as
possible.”

“One month before the kickoff date
for the march, we will set up the towns
of tents and have people living in them.
That way we can work out all the
bugs,” said Kleiner. “Then two weeks
prior to March 1, all the marchers will
report to L.A. for an orientation
period. This way, everyone will be
prepared for the big day."

At the end of the march, the group
will set up camp outside Washington,
D.C. On December 15, the marchers
and an estimated one million supporters
will enter D.C. and hold a candlelight
vigil and a demonstration to urge all
governments to “Take’em down.” '

The people watching the procession
of marchers entering the nation’s
capital will only see the culmination of
two years of fund—raising, planning and
 sacrifice. Sacrifices that were made
to make a statement against the nuclear
arms race. A statement and event that
was started by the fears of a seven-
year-old girl. Prophetic fears.

wards, they will continue their sojourn
to Forbes Avenue and then to Schenley
Park, where they will set up camp.
During their stay, many activities will
take place to motivate Pittsburghers

4 Qwards peace. There will be a peace

film festival, a peace poetry reading by
the Pittsburgh Poetry Exchange, a five
kilometer peace run and probably a
concert at the Civic Arena by one of
the major acts supporting the march
(such as Melissa Manchester, Carol
King, and Madonna).

Even with an estimated one-third of
the marchersbeing college students,
the University of Pittsburgh has yet to
initiate the planning of any activities.
Andrew Smith, the director of student
activities, said that “Nothing has been
planned from the university standpoint.

“We have some Pitt students com-
ing over on the 22nd to talk about set-
ting something up, but no formal ac-
tivities as yet,” said Evans on Pitt’s in-
volvement in the march.

When the march comes to its conclu-
sion in November at Washington,
D.C., Evans estimates that, ‘ ‘probably
 people will gather for the ral-
ly. We expect a lot will be college
kids.” If the march goes over well here
in the states, there very well may be
a follow-up peace march through
Europe.

“At this time a second stage is in
discussion in which we would march
through Europe and into the Soviet
Union,” said Evans. “We are present-
ly negotiating with German officials
about crossing the border into East
Germany.”

Whether or not the desired effect of
global nuclear disarmament is possible
is still questionable. But, one thing to

p in mind as the marchers gear up

I for their hike are the words of Presi-

dent Eisenhower: “The people want
peace so much that one day the govern-
ments of the world will get out of their
way and let them have it.“

After his administrative role in the
APA comes to a close. Perloff plans
to devote more time to his writing and
consulting activities in the field of
quantitative and organizational
psychology and to teaching.

At Pitt‘s graduate school of business.
Perloff teaches an MBA course called
Human Behavior in Business and a
Ph.D. seminar in Program Evaluation.
The MBA course applies behavioral
science to the business world to “help
managers do a better job of manag-
ing."

Perloff likes teaching at Pitt. He says
he learns a lot from his students.
“There are some very nice people
here. and my students are very bright.
They don‘t fit the business stereotype
of being cold and calculating. They
want to do the right thing." said
Perloff. “They're eager to learn. eager
to Lise behavior science to help them to
succeed. They stop short of being
unethical. fradulent and inean—spirited
and are motivated to succeed morally.
with compassion to employees.“

At 64. Perloff does not plan to
discontinue his endeavors when he
reaches the university’s mandatory
retirement age of 70. He intends to
keep up with his writings and con-
sulting and perhaps move to another
university where he can continue
teaching.

“I think it’s psychologically healthy
to be active,” said Perloff. “If you use
your mind and body and keep them
functioning at a good level, you could
live longer."

Perloff does not believe in giving up.
“One way to fail is not to try. But to
try new things is important. When we
fail, we can see ourselves better and
work on our weaknesses. Also, by sur-

viving failures. we gain self-conﬁdence I

and use this knowledge to carry us
through new setbacks.”

Perloff is not a stranger to disap-
pointment. He can recall several in-
cidents where he felt that he had failed.
The most recent oecured when he ran
for president of the APA in 1982. He
came in third but ran again the follow-
ing year and currently holds the
presidency. Each time he failed.
Perloff recalled, he was bitter and
reproachful. But he used the opportuni-
ty to take a better look at himself and
work harder the next time.

Perloff feels there is an overemphasis
on social support and a neglect of per-
sonal support. People should learn to
help themselves more. In light of his
past experience and present ac-
complishments. he has certainly
depended on his own abilities. As
president of the APA. psychologist.
teacher and family man, Perloff lives
by his motto of trying new things and
not giving up.

Litchfield brought political experience toPi1t 3

debate were dividing the academic

By Marilyn McNeal
Staff Writer

Editor ’s Note: This article is one of a
series ofon going stories exploring the
lzistory of Pitt ’s buildings.

The three cylindrical towers that
loom between Fifth Avenue and Forbes
Avenue are only one of the many visi-
ble and invisible reminders of Dr. Ed-
ward H. Litchfield, the businessman.
educator, and innovator who came to
the University of Pittsburgh 31 years
ago. The Litchfield Towers, large,
tough, and multi-faceted, share many
qualities with their creator.

In the early ’50s, Litchfield was
founder and chairman of the board of
the Governmental Affairs Institute, a
private nonprofit research group that
was based in Washington, D.C. When
he came to Pittsburgh to request funds
from the Maurice and Laura Falk foun-
dation for a voter study to be conducted
by GAI. he had no idea that the
favorable impression he projected
would lead to his ten-year term of of-
fice as Chancellor of Pitt. The ex-
ecutive director of the foundation
recommended Litchfield as a candidate
for the vacant post of Chancellor and
after two negative replies from Litch-
field, the University received an accep-

tance and. entered into an area of

development and growth.

On July 18, 1955, Litchﬁeld was ap-
pointed the twelfth Chancellor of Pitt
and the successor of Dr. R.H. Fitz-
gerald, the former Chancellor who had
retired in June of 1954. As the new
academic leader of Pitt, Litchfield
brought with him many years of ex-
perience in the academic, political and
business worlds.

Born in Detroit, the son ofa post of-
fice official. Litchfield excelled early
in his undergraduate studies at the
University of Michigan. After a brief
setback in his failure to win the race
for the state senate, Litchfield began
studying political science and left the
University of Michigan four years later
with a Ph.D. in political science and
a teaching position at Brown Univer-
sity. At age 31, he went to post—war

Germany and played a major role in the
united efforts to reorganize the German
political structure. Other involvements
in the realm of national and interna-
tional affairs include his membership
in the United States delegation to the
Moscow and London conferences of
the Council of Foreign Ministers and
his position as consultant to the
secretary of the Army.

After teaching at Cornell Universi-
ty and acting as dean of its Graduate
School of Business and Public Ad-
ministration, Litchfield, despite his
demanding involvements as chairman
of the board of the Smith—Corona
Typewriter Company and the director
of the AVCO Manufacturing Corpora-
tion, became the twelfth Chancellor at
Pitt.

When Litchfield came to Pitt, the
University was known as the “Trolley
College” because of its intense concen-
tration of local commuters and an
academic atmosphere overshadowed by

When Litchﬁeld came to Pitt, the
university was known as the
“Trolley College” because of its
intense concentration of local com-
muters and an academic at-
mosphere overshadowed by provin-
cialism. Litchﬁeld made it clear
from the onset that he felt Pitt had
the “potential to become one of the
great national universities. ”

provincialism. Litchfield made it clear
from the onset that he felt Pitt had “the
potential to become one of the great na-
tional universities.” He predicted that
by 1969 Pitt would be one of the top
dozen universities in the nation. When
Pitt’s trustees allocated $1 million for
a campus expansion program, Litch-
field was ready with a vision of Pitt’s
future that left no stone unturned.
One of the most immediate concerns
was the need for on—campus housing.
To meet this need, Litchﬁeld super-
vised the acquisition of the Schenley
Park Hotel, now the William Pitt
Union, and the Schenley Park Apart-
ments for student dormatories. Plans

were drawn up for the Litchfield
Towers. By 1965. 3,000 students were
living on campus. .

Next. Litchfield turned towards the
faculty and educational programs of-
fered at Pitt. The faculty was increased
by 19 percent bringing the faculty-
student ratio down to 9-1 while the
overall quality of the faculty was im-
proved through such measures as the
doubling of full—time teachers, the 10-
percent raise in salary, the recruitment
of outstanding scholars (the percentage
of the faculty with doctoral degrees in-
creased by 34 percent) and the endow-
ment of academic chairs. Three
schools, three departments, 10 centers,
and 17 programs were added while en-
trance standards were raised and tui-
tion increased by 50 percent. But the
changes weren’t limited to just
academics.

Langley, Scaife and Trees Halls
were constructed and the Medical
School, Engineering and Natural
Sciences buildings were either built or
renovated. Forbes Field, the former
home of the Pittsburgh Pirates, was
bought while the 11-month trimester
system was implemented and the two-
year regional campus system was
created. But even these changes paled
in comparison to the three projects
Litchfield developed and nurtured.

Litchﬁeld created the Oakland Cor-
poration, a private organization made
up of Pitt and five institutions from the
Oakland area dedicated to the
redevelopment of Oakland. One of the
projects of the Oakland Corp. was the
planning of Panther Hollow, a research
park that was supposed to have science
labs, study areas, botanical gardens,
apartments, restaurants, a theatre, and
parking for 8,000 cars. Panther Hollow
would have been one of the world’s

~ largest research parks.

In addition to this elaborate vision,
Litchﬁeld had hopes of building a space
research center costing $33 million
with a $1.5 million grant from NASA.
Both Panther Hollow and the space
research center never came through.
Litehfield’s expansive vision was
grounded by harsh ﬁnancial realities.

By 1964, Pitt was operating with a
$4.5 million deﬁcit. Controversy and

Pitt hangs o 170 vietoy  

By Randy Miller
Assistant Sports Editor

Everyone on the Pitt basketball team
had been playing up to expectations
after head coach Roy Chipman went to
a smaller lineup eight games ago —— ex-
cept star forward/center Charles Smith.

In fact, Smith scored a measly 15
points and grabbed only nine rebounds
in the two games prior to last night’s
matchup with the Big East Con-
ference’s cellar dweller —- Providence.

Pitt and Providence played sloppy
basketball throughout the game, but the
return of Smith kept the Panthers in the
lead most of the game. Smith scored
a game high 24 points and pulled down
nine rebounds as Pitt sneaked by Pro-
vidence 71-70 before a sellout crowd
of 6,798 at the Fitzgerald Field House.

Pitt is now 3-2 (fourth place) in Big
East play and 1 1-4 overall. Providence
fell to 0-4 in the Big East and 8-7
overall.

Senior reserve forward Darryl
Shepherd scored the winning points for
Pitt as he sank a 15—footjumper from
the foul line with 11 seconds remain-
ing in the game to pull Pitt back into
the lead.

Providence, a 14-point underdog,
immediately called a time—out, setting
up a play in hope of pulling off the
upset. The Friars set up guard Matt
Palazzi on the baseline, and his jumper
hit all net, but the officials said the shot
went off just after the final buzzer had
sounded.

“We wanted Palazzi to shoot,” Pro-
vidence head coach Rick Pitino said.

“"We wanted the pass to go toihim at
the baseline. We did it too late.”

Providence did manage to play the
Panthers virtually even throughout the
contest by outrebounding Pitt 39-30
and forcing the Panthers to turn the ball
over 17 times.

“We just didn’t play,” said Chipman
shaking his head in disgust. “They
outplayed us. We looked  ifwe were
trying to be to fancy instead ofjust try-
ing to play."

Smith was one Panther who was
determined to play  and hard.

The sophomore from Bridgeport,
Conn., said he was slumping because

he wasn’t playing as physically as he
had in past games.

“I watched some video tapes of
myself from last year and I saw myself
playing more aggressive,” Smith said.
“I just played hard tonight.”

Fortunately for Pitt, Smith was more
determined against Providence. He re-
bounded with force, hit the jumpers he
had been missing recently, and when
the opportunity presented itself, dunked
the ball with all the might his 6-10,
225-lb. frame could muster.

Smith scored 11 first-half points as
Pitt lead at intermission 34-29.

The Panthers maintained a slim lead
until Providence center Steve Wright
hit a three—point play with 12:59 re-
maining to tie it at 44-44.

Pitt regained the lead, however, and
led 69-64 with 3: 13 remaining. But two
Wright free throws followed by a pair
of buckets by Dave Kipfer thrusted
Providence into the lead at 70-69 with
2:03 left in the contest.

When Demetreus Gore’s pass was
intercepted with 1:23 left, Providence
had the ball and the lead.

Billy Donovan, who led Providence
with 18 points, missed a jumper with
45 seconds left and Pitt’s Joey David
rebounded.

Pitt looked for Smith inside, but
when he wasn’t open, Shepherd decid-
ed to drive the lane with 15 seconds left.
He fumbled the ball for a moment, but
quickly picked up the loose ball at the
foul line, took one step toward the hoop
and swished the jumper.

“It felt good,” Shepherd said of his
game—winning shot. “I would have
been surprised if it didn’t go in.”

It did go in and Pitt survived, despite
Chipman’s criticism of his team’s play.
But Chipman added,“Whenever you
play poorly and win, it’s a plus.”

Notebook: Chipman said after the
game that forward Matt Miklasevich
will not be available for three weeks
due to an ankle injury  Pitino has
already had enough of Charles Smith.
He joked following the game, “Charles
Smith should be smart and go hardship
to the NBA. He should get out of this
league.” More seriously, Pitino add-
ed, “Two years from now, Smith will
be a top—five pick in the NBA draft.
He’s that good.”

Pitt’s Demetreus Gore scored 20 points last night.

Chaz Palla/The Pitt News

Gore Walked a fine line last night

By Bob Travers
Staff Writer

The line between being the_hero and
the goat is as thin as the razor’s edge
in a one—point basketball game, and last
night Demetreus Gore came a whisker
away from turning a Panther win into
a sharp one-point Pitt loss. With Pitt
holding on to a tenuous one-point lead
and 1:23 left, Gore came down with a
rebound and had the ball stripped from
him. giving Providence the ball. A few
seconds later Providence took the lead.

Fortunately for the Panthers, Gore
was able to stay on the safe side of the
edge and finished the game as the spark
that ignited the recently sputtering Pitt
offense. Gore finished with 20 points
and seven rebounds in Pitt's 71-70 win
last night over the Friars of Providence
College.

“Everything was going well and I
just kept trying to do what I was doing
in the first half,” a decidedly relieved
Gore said after the game. “But I got
a little out of control, and it didn‘t work
out that well. But I think I definitely
learned a lesson: Just play it safe at the
end of the game and hold on to the
win.”

Primarily a guard last season, Gore
was moved to the small forward posi-
tion earlier in the year by head coach
Roy Chipman. That switch has done
wonders for the statistics ofyoung Mr.
Gore. Following his performance last
night, Gore has two consecutive
20-point games, is shooting around 56
percent from the floor and is averag-
ing 17 points per game. But Gore
doesn't think much of the switch at all.

“It‘s not that much of an adjust-
ment,” Gore said. “I’m still running
the same plays. The only change I had

to make is when we are in a 3-2
defense. I don’t go all the way to the
baseline, but other than that, it’s the
same.”

A help to anyone playing forward.
whether a new position or one as
familiar as the shape of the basketball,
is having Charles Smith up front with
you. With Smith in the game, it’s only
a matter of time before something
magical happens. Last night, that mo-
ment came late in the first halfwith Pitt
holding on to a five—point lead and Pro-
vidence with the ball. Gore stole the
ball and dazzled at least two Friar
players and a sold—out Fitzgerald Field
House with moves lifted directly from
the Detroit playground he invented
them on. Gore took the ball and deftly
slid the ball to a leaping Smith who
smashed the ball through the net with
a ferociousness that was only ﬁtting for
such a stunning play.

That play culminated what was an
outstanding half for Gore, who finished
the first 20 minutes with nine points
and four rebounds. But his first—half
play gave no clue to the sometimes
reckless play he exhibited during the
second stanza.

In the second half Gore committed
seven turnovers. many of them prov-
ing to be costly mistakes. The Friars
throughout the game were quick to
capitalize on any Panther miscues. But
the important thing for Gore is that he
didn’t provide Providence with a gift
win. But. oh my, was it close!

“When things are going all your
way. you tend to go out of control a
little,“ Gore repeated, but he did add
the game could be a good sign for the
Panthers‘ future days. “I think it's very
important for us to be able to win a
close game like this one.”

Chipman was in no mood last night
to think about down the road. He
spared few words in letting Gore know
his thoughts on the sophomore’s
ballhandling. “He did get on my case
and I deserved it,” Gore said. “But I
hope I can learn from my mistakes and
improve for the next game.”

Chipman said after the game he was

pleased with Gore’s overall perform-
ance. but mentioned Gore’s mistakes

could have hurt the Panthers down the —

stretch.

Fortunately, Chipman and Gore had

their worries washed away by a tick-

ing clock that was only a millisecond
faster than Pitt needed. If Matt Palaz-
zi’s ball had been releasedjust a split-
second sooner, Demetreus Gore might
never want to see another razor.

The edge between victory and defeat
can be so sharp, so fine.

Lock Haven next on

list for Wrestlers

By Patrick Good
Staff Writer

The Pitt wrestling team is off to a
ﬁne start this season. The Panthers own
a 2-0-1 record overall and are 1-0 in
Eastern Wrestling League dual meets.
Tomorrow will be a very important
match as the Panthers host EWL op-
ponent Lock Haven at Trees Hall.

In their last two matches Pitt has
knocked off 18th—ranked West Virginia
25-13, and tied No. 9 Lehigh 21-21.

The early success of the Panthers has
come from a team effort. All of the
starters have contributed. although
three individuals have led the way.
Senior co-captains Kyle Nellis (18-3
this season) and John Hnath (19-4).
along with freshman Pat Santoro
(16-4), have been instrumental in
leading their team.

“Our team is doing really well."
said head coach Rande Stottlemyer.
“We’re on course as to where we want
to be. We're just now getting back on
a good schedule. and if we stay injury-
free, will be in every match."

Meanwhile, Lock Haven has strug-
gled so far; they‘ve been in and out of
the Top 20 rankings all season. In the
last rankings they stood in the 20th
position. Lock Haven has now won
four straight matches after losing four
of their ﬁrst six dual meets. However,
Pitt looks to end that short streak.

“This team [Lock Haven] is capable
of being ranked." said Stottlemyer.
“At last check-they were 20th. but
they'll probably drop in the new rank-
ings. They are still tough and will be
a very strong opponent.

“Things will be pretty even going in-
to the match. We’ll be a slight under-
dog as we have been against West
Virginia and Lehigh. but our guys are
looking forward to the challenge."

Both teams enter tomorrow’s contest
with several top performers. Three of
Lock Haven’s wrestlers have national
ranking credentials. One of them. Matt
Avery. at 126 lbs.. is ranked third in
the nation and stands at 21-5-1. Avery
upset defending national champion
Rick Bonomo of Bloomsburg at the
Sheridan Invitational in Bethlehem. Pa.
The senior co-captain duplicated the
performance. defeating Bonomo again
on Bonomo’s home mat during a dual
meet.

Matching up against Avery will be
John Hnath. Although not listed in cur-
rent rankings. he‘s having a fine season
thus far with the most wins (19) on the
Panther squad.

“Avery and Hnath will be a good
match," said Stottlemyer. “Johnny
really hasn’t wrestled that super. He’s
lost two straight. but he hasn't got roll-
ing just yet."

In addition to Avery. Lock Haven
also boasts two ranked wrestlers among

  

John Hnath
the nation’s best in Brad Lloyd, 23-3.
and Greg Wykoff. 21-9, weighing 167
and 177 lbs. respectively.

According to Stottlemyer, Lloyd is
the best among the Lock Haven
wrestlers in spite of being just a
sophomore.

Two starters on the Panther squad
are also ranked. Nellis. the school’s all-
time winning wrestler with 86 victories
to date. is ranked in two polls. He’s
rated fourth by Amateur Wrestling
News and fifth by National Mat News.
Teammate Pat Santoro is ranked 20th
by Mat News and is sure to move up
with his outstanding record and
progress.

For Coach Stottlemyer, the biggest
concern is in the upper weight classes.
Stottlemyer said. “We’ll be in every
match. but our big guys need to take
us further if were to progress and peak
by season's end. This will be a good
time to start.“

McRae leads Pitt at

Ohio State

By Jim Pietras
Assistant Sports Editor

This past weekend. the men‘s track
team made its way to Columbus. Ohio
to take on Ohio State and West Virginia
Universities in a tri-meet. while the
women’s team faced Ohio State.

The men's team tied Ohio State at 61'
while WVU finished a distant third
with 39 points. The women didn‘t fare
as well. however. as OSU won big
100-33.

"We were pretty pleased with the
results." said Pitt coach John Vasvary.
“Last year [Ohio State and West
Virginia] beat us pretty bad. They were
basically the same teams as last year.
both with more strength.“

The Panthers men’s team was beaten
last year 87-61 by West Virginia and
101-19 by Ohio State. This year.
however. the tables turned.

Pitt was once again led by Lee
McRae. who placed first in both the
55—meter and the 300—meter dashes.
Also with strong showings for Pitt were
Tim Manes (first in the l.000—meter
run). David Moore (first in the
800-meter run) and George Ifill (third
in both the long and triple jumps).‘

tri-meet

turned in the best performance of the
day. Vasvary stated: “It would be Lee
McRae. He set two ﬁeld house records
in the 55—metcr dash and the 300—meter
dash. and he set a school record."

Vasvary was excited about his team’s
fine performance. This was the first
time that the Vasvary-coached Panthers
squad has defeated West Virginia.

Pitt‘s women's track coach Steve
Lewis was not as happy as Vasvary in
the team score department. but he was
pleased with the fact that he had six
runners qualify for the Eastern Cham-
pionships in seven events.

“The score was overwhelmingly in
their favor." Lewis said. “However.
I was generally pleased with the
results.“

Debbie Bonner qualified in two
events by placing third in both the
55-meter dash and the 55—meter
hurdles. Other qualifiers included Pat
Cupid (55-meter dash). Lynn Pike
(long jump) and Sue Torre (500-meter
run).

Two school records were also set at
the meet. both of which qualified the
runners for the Eastern Champion-
ships. Dana Roberts came in first in the
triple jump with an effort of 37-4 ‘/4.
while Lori Wood placed second in the
5.000—meter run with a school record
time of 18:06.9.

The Pitt News, January 15, 1986

Lady Panthers host St. John’s

By John Enright
Staff Writer

The Pitt Lady Panther's basketball
team hosts Big East ri'~.'al St. John’s
tonight in an important game at Fitz-
gerald Field House.

The Lady Panthers have lost their
last two games — Boston College and
Syracuse — and have dropped below
the .500 mark in league play at 2-3.
This makes tonight‘s contest especial-
ly important for Pitt.

Head coach Kirk Bruce agreed. "I
think it‘s an important game for us
because this is the third top—notch team
in the Big East that we‘re playing and
we need to beat one ofthem. We have
to do what it takes to win. It's as sim-
ple as that. I thought that going into
Boston College and Syracuse all we
had to do was play a pretty good
basketball game and we could have
beaten both of them."

St. John‘s has a good team and will
be a difficult foe for Pitt. "They have

a blend of senior leadership and a cou-
ple of good freshmen on their team."
explained Bruce. "They have a
freshman from Pittsburgh. Maureen
Conley [Mt. Alvernia High School}.
who has been starting for them and do-
ing a good job."

Bruce also pointed out guard/for-

“It’s a big game for us
because this is the third top-
notch team in the Big East
that we’re playing and we
have to beat one of them. ”

— Kirk Brace

ward Jackie Smith and forward Althea
Yard as two of St. John’s top players.
"Smith is a good player and should
make some of the conference aIl—star
teams this year, and Yard is going to
be a really good player. She has a lot
of talent."

Pitt will have to play well in all
phases of the game to win tonight,
although Bruce views two areas as most
important. "We have to rebound the
ball well. They killed us in rebounding
last year. Also. we have to get even
more production off our bench than we
have been getting."

The Lady Panthers have had some
bright spots despite the recent misfor-
tunes. Kim Tirik and Kim Gannis con-
tinue to play well at the guard spots.
Forward Sally Sheerer played well at
Syracuse last Saturday (20 points). as
did center Jenny Tyner.

Pitt‘s fifth starter. forward Jane
Plake, is in a mild slump. according to
Bruce. “Jane has the capabilities to do
a lot for us. but she has been unproduc-
tive the Iast couple of games. But
knowing Jane like I know her. she'll
break out of it with no problem.”

Pitt would like to end their two—game
slump. "We have to start playing
well,” Bruce said, “and bring home
some victories."

Pitt hockey team defeats Dayton

By Mary Wolf
Staff Writer

The Pittsburgh Hockey Club split
their two games last weekend when
they travelled to Ohio to take on the
University of Dayton in two exhibition
bouts. The Panthers were dealt a 7-2
loss Saturday. but they retaliated by
upsetting Dayton 5-2 in a second con-
test on Sunday. The Panthers remain
undefeated in regular season play.

Dayton scored first in Saturday‘s
game early in the first period. followed
shortly by two consecutive Panther
goals by Bele and Barbara. Pitt was
held scoreless for the remaining two
periods as Dayton went on to put the
puck in the net five more times. four
of which came on power play
opportunities. _

Numerous Pittsburgh penalties.
especially in the second period. allowed
Dayton the one—man advantage and
proved to be one of Pitt’s major
downfalls. The weakness could lie in
the Panthers’ penalty killing ability. but
Coach Roger Oldaker Sr. believes that
the team must make a continuous ef-
fort to reduce the number of ac-
cumulated penalties.

“Sure. we could use work on our
penalty killing. but we have to work

harder on not taking the penalties in the
first place. The whole second period
we were shorthanded. When you‘re
killing penalties all of the time
everybody wears down."

Oldaker also attributed the loss in
part to a breakdown in the condition-
ing of the team due to their idleness

"over the break. “We were off for a

month and we just weren’t ready for
that level and that speed. It’s a lot like
walking and running. For about a
month. our guys have been walking.
It was a matter of getting used to the
pace again."

Pitt quickly made the adjustment and
was able to pull off a win in Sunday’s
game. According to right wing Roger
Oldaker Jr.. Pitt‘s third and game-
winning goal was scored by Dayton’s
netminder. "We were killing a penal-
ty and Jeff Bele iced the puck into their
end. I went into the corner and put a
little pressure on their goalie. He tried
to throw the puck into the other cor-
ner but it hit the post and went into his
own net. Their goalie scored our third
goal."

Bele. while receiving credit for the
ﬂuke goal. also scored two additional
times giving him a hat trick before
Oldaker upped the Panther lead for a
final time within the last few seconds
of the game on an empty netter. Pitt’s

second goal was scored by defenseman
Gregg Schmidtetter.

This year. the Panthers are playing
a heavier exhibition schedule by
challenging teams out oftheir own divi-
sion which are often stronger than the
local teams which Pitt is accustomed
to playing. “were playing teams of
better caliber and sometimes we lose
to them." said goalie John Godwin.
who went on to explain some of the
reasons for Pitt‘s difficulty in defeating
the more experienced teams such as
Dayton and Navy. “It has to do with
conditioning. plus we don’t work
together as much as a team as we could
because we don’t get a chance to play
together much. We realize that we
could be very good if we got more ice
time."

The Pitt Hockey Club may never get
a chance to reach its full potential due
to limited funds which restrict their
practices to one per week. They con—
tinue to challenge teams which are
much better conditioned just to gain ex-
perience. They hope that even the
losses against these powerful teams will
better prepare them for the remaining
regular season games. Victories over
‘such teams bring their own satisfaction.

Pitt‘s next game is on Saturday at
Lakevue when the Panthers will faceoff
against Slippery Rock.
