Johnson
To Head .
WPGH

By BARRYJGROSS

Dan Johnson, news man-
ager of campus radio station
WPGH this term, was named
new general gmanager at a
banquet Monday evening.

WPGH staff members and

guests gathered in Dining Room A
of the Student Union to hear gen-
eral manager Richard Rauh praise
their efforts and evaluate what the
station has accomplished since it
went on the air fourteen weeks
ago. _
Rauh expressed “deep emotional
satisfaction with being associated
withpthe station and introduced a
short tape recording that gave ex-
cerpts from various WPGH pro-
grams, including coverage of John
Glenn’s homecoming, Chancellor
Litchfield’s dedication of the sta-
tion, interviews with Doc Carlson
and Odetta, and a comedy “demon—
stration” of atomic fission.
Firestone Delivers Invocation
Nate Firestone, program direc-
tor, gave the invocation before the
meal, and, later in the evening,

explained the station’s philosophy
of “content programming.”

Key speakerfor the evening
was Associate Professor James
F. Clarke from the history de-
partment. ,

His first short talk, “Voice of
America Revisited,” was a collec-
tion of anecdotes about his experi-
ences with that organization.

Then he reported on “Dial E for
Education,” a humorous collection
of observations on the possible fu-
ture of education. Extrapolating
on current advances in the tech-
nology of education, Clarke de-
scribed a future where students
would remain in their dorms and
“attend” classes through TV, ear-
phones, and wa1kie—talkie.

The Nationality rooms, he con-
cluded, would be “maintained as

‘a museum with wax professors
and, students, which wouldn’t be
much of a change.”

Two Religion
Classes Added

Courses ‘In Judaism

Set For Fall Term

Two courses
which are given by the Grad-
uate School of Education will
be given a lOO—series number
so as to enable undergrad-

uates to take them, according

to the Committee on undergrad-
uate Curriculum.

One of the courses will be given
in the fall trimester and the other
in the winter trimester. Both
courses are given by Dr. Aharon
Kessler, adjunct in the Graduate
Faculty.

“Basic Ideas of Judaism” will
be offered in the fall. The course
consists of the treatment of Jew-
ish attitudes toward basic values
in civilizatiori, as reflected in Jew-
ish literary sources, such as the
Bible, Apocrypha, Talmud, and
writings of medieval Jewish phil-._
osophers.

The course open to undergrad-
uates for the winter trimester will
be “Jewish Ethical Values.” It
consists of an analysis of ethical
values in. Jewish religious
thought: man and his moral free-
dom: love, justice, peace, truth,
social justice; respect for persons
and life: the equality of all hu-
man beings, the individual and
the community; family life: and
God and man.

Both courses are worth two
credits. They will be given Mon-
days from 6:30 p.m. to 8:10 p.m.

ALGERIA

Tomorrow at 8:10 p.m. WPGH
will present an hour long spe-
cial on “De Gaulle and Algeria”
under its “Pitt Explores the
World” series. Nancy Gross and
Vasanth K. Bhat will interview
Alain Micheau from France and
Leila Hariz from Algeria.

Development Meets

With Mild Opposition

Several prominent Pittsburghers have announced mild
opposition to the Oakland Corporation’s proposal to construct
an industrial reseairchpark in the Upper Hill District area.‘

Samuel P. Chase, president of the Greater Pittsburgh
Chamber of Commerce, has said that the idea for the re-
search park originated within the Chamber of Commerce last

fall and implied that Chancellorb

Litchﬁelc. and Oakland Institu-
tions have accepted an undue
amount of credit for the Hill Dis-
trict project. .

Schenley Farms Civic Associa-
tion President Paul -Teitzein men-
tioned that Schenley Farms resi;-
dents were rather surprised that,
“we have been protecting our
residential zoning for years and
intend to keep doing so.”

Planner Explains

Robert B‘. Pease, executive di-
rector of the Urban Redevelop-
ment Authority, explained that
the city does not intend to con-
demn sound housing — 76 percent
of Hill District housing nearest
Oakland is still good.

In addition, several city plan-
ners feel that the Upper Hill
District could better be renewed
by razing substandard housing,
erecting new dwellings and
leaving .the sound housing alone.
The planners feel that the
Forbes-Fifth Avenue Area from
the Lower Hill District out to
Oakland might be a far better
site for the research group.

In spite of questions regard-
ing credit for and location of the
research park, however, all of the
sources mentioned feel that the

- idea is basically sound and that

the complex’ would be of con-
siderable beneﬁt to Pittsburgh.

' No opposition has been voiced
to any of the corporation’s other
aims in their Oakland renewal
program. '

In additionto grants for recruit-

Dean Lancour will open a re-

the University’s trimester system,
a library science degree will take
less than a year. '

Work-study trineeships will
be awarded to some which will

librarians to enter the school in
the fall with an income.

Analyzes Librarian Shortage
Ralph Blasingame, Jr., head of

asserts that the librarian shortage

3-igency Has Holiday Hearl..-relic

By JACK! KATZ
An average of ten to 15 stu-
dents visit the University Travel
Service every day gand receive

' help in making their transporta-

tion reservations. The service has
already helped between 200 and

. 300 students planning to travel

during the Easter vacation, ac-
cording to Beatrice Scott, a mem-
ber of the stall.

“More students make re.<erva—
tions for planes than for other
means of transportation,” Miss
Scott said. “We also arrange for
cruises and Greyhound tickets,
though.” The service will handle
tour arrangements for students
going to Europe if they want it.

The travel service is available
to the general public as well as
to the University community. “We

have few problems," stated“Miss

Scott. “Trips to Africa are more
involved than the others.”
Offers Other Services
C In addition to making reserva-
tions the travel. service will also
make hotel reservations, charter
buses, hire rental cars, and handle
ﬂight insurance. They will also
make group arrangements. Pack-
age tours are available if the stu-
dents want it.” The main students
who take advantage of the service
are girls planning‘ their honey-
moons,” Miss Scott said.
According to Miss Scott the
service is not as rushed now as
it was at Thanksgiving and
Christmas. Many students fly-
ing to New York at these times
may have trouble getting flight

The state of our library has been criticized extensively
in the past for its meager offerings. Yet what books we
dohave are gradually dwindling due to ‘certain lazy or
forgetful students who will.not return a particularly in-
teresting novel or term paper source when finished with it.

So often the new Hillman Library is cited as the savior
of’ the University of Pittsburgh academically, and our
Graduate School of Library Science has just been award-
ed a $20,000 grant by the state to achieve an unexcelled

student body to make the system work. During this, For-
giveness Week, all books should be returned.

‘like this:

lWhatever you have, bequeathed
you by your father,

Earn it in order to possess it.

Things a man uses not, a heavy
load beget,

But what the hour brings forth,
that he can use and bless it.
A person of culture is one

who is enlightened concerning

the things of the mind and able

to make‘ competent judgments

about them. Most men yearn to

t become such persons. Therefore, they seek ‘educa-
tion, that is, they desire that one should lead them
to the sourcesiof knowledge. Sooner or later, they
learn that they can reach these sources only by
entering upon the whole cultural legacy which
A has been left to them by their fathers and pre-

decessors.

Fit to Life

They thus become cultured as they appropriate
this heritage for themselves and make it their own
and then they try to ﬁt it to their own lives by -
relating it to the values. which they wish to see-
cultivated and which .they hope will be embodied
.in civilization. * ' Q i

In other words, menshare in the’ life and up-

selves responsibly to the heritage, of the past (the
cultural achievements ‘of the generations that have
gone before them), ﬁrst by appropriating it for

Letters to the Editor  

Coed. ‘Questions

Dormitory Policies

Editor, The Pitt News:

For some time I have been
concerned with what I consider
the expensive, unnecessary and
outmoded dormitory system here
at Pitt. The system of curfews,
the signingin and out, the con-

, stant supervision of women stu-

dents, the requirement to pur-
chase a $250 meal ticket, seem to
me to be lingering remnants of an
earlier and'passing social period
in American life.

These unnecessary , restrictions
certainly cannot inculcate respon-
sibility, into today’s coed, ‘rather
they foment immaturity; Certain-
ly-, it must be recognized that re-
sponsibility is not something
which may be imparted through
coercion and established rules.

At the age of 18 most ofusa

leave our homes tolarrive upon
the college campus intent upon
pursuing a higher education. We
are greeted as we arrive as ‘_‘the
new. ‘women 7 students.” ‘And we
are eager to assume independence
and responsibility and to pursue
the opening intellectual horizons
which, we expecttotﬁnd at a uni-
versity. Rather, what do we ﬁnd?

We ﬁnd restrictions here often
more stringent than at an earlier
age; we ﬁnd that rather than ex-
ercising responsibility by an in-
telligent direction of our own af-
fairs, we are denied this pos-
sibility.

I cannot help but to question
the motives of these regulations
of women students. Do those in
authority really think that they
are protecting our health, safety
or morality? Are we to be mold-
ed by outside authority, or may
we not begin as individuals to
provide for our own welfare? It
must be recognized that most of
our high school classmates of per-
haps less ability or diﬁering am-
bitions are now leading indepen-
dent lives as career women or as

h.ousewfves. But we have chosen;

to go on with an education. _Does
this make, us less responsible,
weaker-willed individuals than
our I “independent” high
school friends?

Granted, there is a period of
transitionlto be made from high
school to college. And I recognize
perhaps the importance of reg.-
ulations of freshman women to
effect. a smooth transition and
aid in the establishment of ade-
quate study habits. But to extend
this regulation for four years is
an absurdity!

What are the implications for
these restrictions upon the qual-
ity of women graduates of Pitt
and other American universities?
Is not. this system of supervision
and restriction after all merely an
investment in the" mediocre, un-
disciplined individual, is it not
wholesale. nursing and coddling‘ of
those‘ students who‘ should not be
at a university in the first place;
who lack maturity _and will not

now

ﬁnd it here under such a~system?t

I cannot help butthink that we
are encouraging weakness, sub-
missiveness and mediocrity"-— and
it is ‘a sad comment upon Amer-
ican education. The abolition of
such a ” system of restrictions
(which we pay for with our
money) would be a positive step
toward the -improvement of the
calibre of the American woman
undergraduate. May we not be ac-
corded in reality that status which
they confer upon us theoretically?

Convocation Cutting
Editor, The Pitt News:

It was a great privilege and
pleasure to hear ‘Barbara Ward at
the Honors Convocation. It was
a surprise to see only a fraction
of thepstudent body turn out ,to
hear Miss Ward speak in her in-

imitable British accent on a ma-

 

jor problem confronting the free
world — freedom, and what it
entails. '

~ No newspaper account, however
complete and accurate, can do
justice to the speech Miss‘ Ward
delivered in a quite digniﬁed yet
forceful way. No superlatives can
be too flattering for it. It is in-
deed an honor to graduate from
an institution which has confer-
red on her an honorary degree.

It was also heartening to note
‘ that Miss Ward, ‘who received as
standing ovation fromi the audi-
ence, advocates that the Western
nations lend a helpinghand to
the less fortunate infant and yet
unborn African and underdevel-
oped democracies. This is espe-
cially encouragingat a time when
nearly everyone seems to regard
“the good isamartian” gesture as

wasteful. ‘

Sports Editor

“It Goes On..."

«FINE YOUNG CANNIBALS

Jim Traficant is a Tennessee Williams extrovert whose
original homestead is Youngstown, Ohio——a tranquil ham-

let once labeled “Murdertown, U.S.A.’s in a yellow-paged
magazine.

With brown bangs searing his forehead, a hard frown furrow-
ing his brown, and his piercing eyes staring fixedly, “Jimb0" is a
tragicomic protagonist. Put a football in his hands instead of a zip-
gun, however. and he’s one of the most talented pass-throwers in
the business. '

And right now, he thinks that the varsity practice field could
be aptly labeled “Murolertown, U.S.A.”

“When I go back, to pass,” he signed, “I'm just another guy

 umber on my back. They all want a shot at me."

  
   

Hood-Hunters Soon

According to Traficant, the new
coaches have injected a tangible
potent into the players, and have
really spurred some cannibalistic
histrionics on the gridiron. “The
ends now want to get a part of.
you. Before the whistle blows next
year,” he warned emphatically,
“I’m telling you, Pitt wi.ll be head—
hunters.

“The other day I dropped back

to throw. and I let go with a

pass. Then I" got hit. Boy. did

A q  __  they clobber me!" Dwelling on

 ‘  _ »  the suicidal lives which his com-

‘ patriots in the quarterback seat

cringe under, he observed. “The

other day I was watching a de-
fensive. scrimmage.

“This quarterback rolled out,”
 -. he explained. “and he was trapped
Jim Troficoni and usually a whistle just blows
and that‘s the end. Well the whistle was blown. and everybody hea.rd
it. but no one stopped. They creamed him, and the coach just smiled.”

The Sm-Hill»?-‘.‘ 008011 Was Frank Laulierbur, who once handled the
mighty Baltimore Colt linemen, and the man responsible for the

‘hungry ends was Ernie Heffcrle. lately of Boston College.

Gain-—TackIing
“The atmosphere is t-ornpletely dil?1’e.,u-cut," Traficant said. “They

have gotten guys to do a lot more than they ever did. The guys

aren't up there just scrimmaging. they’re gang—tackl.in.<:, and really
i putitiug‘ out. v A

"Every team, no matter how low. is really tough. Our “ ‘A’

unit was playing against the ‘C’ unit the other night." he remark-
ed. “And they beat the hell outta us. We went up the next day
after sulking over it for a night and we got back at them, and
moved right over them. We were showing them that we could
rubit in too.

“Coach L=.iutv.trl)ur al\'.=:i,\'.< tells us that ‘you put your pants on
(‘l0\.'~."l'l in the di'cssin:.{ room all together. but you shirt. tcaI'ing them
off each other up tliere on that field.

“An_vbod_3 who doesn‘t have that. attiturlc. including myself,”
TT'zlfl(_'2.IIll cautioned. “is going to be sitting on the bench this year
and watching a good team. If the guys last under these conditions
wo‘ll have a helluva spring game."

No Free Rides

Trnficant re\'erto.d to last year's anemic season to cl.i'aw a com-
parison. “A lot of guys were content to get letters and gel fI‘C0
rides," he claims. “And there were other guys who worked hard for
three years, like (Tom) Brown and (Gary) Kaltcnbach who were
still working to stay in there. Naturally anybody who doesn‘t stand
up to their qualifications probably irked them, and it should’ve.

“I’ll get a lot of guys on my back about this." he said, “but it’s
the truth. There were guys who were just wearing their uniforms
and having bad years, so they just came to the games.

“One bad guy can rub his ideas off on others. just like the apple
in the barrcll business, and we've ha_d enough of that crap. This,
undoubtedly. is the best spring camp I've been in since I was a
freshman. A
_ “When we scrirnmag‘(.-d then. we didn't care who you were.’ ‘he
SI‘(llI(.,‘d. “We just mobbed you. It seems like we're starting all over
again just like that.

A “I just hope I can stay alive long enough to be in this next
football season. We're going somewhere.’

We hope it's Jacksonville, Florida and not Youngstown, Ohio.
