sAlDS research breakthrough
helps predict likely victims

By Jill Carell

‘ Sta ff Writer

¥--M-..‘-." A

Researchers at the University of
Pittsburgh and three other centers
have announced the discovery of
several factors which help predict
why some people exposed to the
AIDS" virus will develop the fatal
disease while others won't.

The study, reported in yéster—

’ day's New England journal of

Medicine, shows that during an
18-month study of 1,835 homo-
sexual men who had been ex-

_ posed to the virus, 59 developed

AIDS.
Two hundred twenty men from
Pittsburgh participated in the

- study, withlsix developing AIDS

during this period.

By comparing men who deve-
loped AIDS with those who were
only infected, disease researchers
found several differences be-

‘ tween the groups.

 

.r'\\_

The most striking difference
was that the men who got AIDS
had a significantly reduced num-
ber of T-helper blood cells. T-
helper cells are necessary for the
body's immune system to re-
spond to an infection or virus,
thus helping fight off disease. The
study showed that_T-helper cells
were at lower levels in those who

later contracted the disease than
those already infected.

Other significant differences
between the two groups were
low levels of antibodies to HIV
(the AIDS virus) in those infected
and a high level of a antibodies

, to cytomegalovirus, a common
and usually minor virus that can '

cause ill effects in AIDS victims.

A reported history of sexual
contact with a person -who later
developed AIDS was also a differ-

ence between those who con_-.

tracted the disease in this study

‘and those who didn't. Although

these factors do not cause AIDS
to develop, they may be an indi-
cation of the course of the

‘disease.

”Our findings are important be-
cause they help us understand
why only some infected men de-
velop AIDS. That information is
useful in counseling men who are
infected, assisting doctors who
have infected patients and espe-
cially in ‘developing future treat-
ments to halt the decline or
improve levels of T-helper cells,”
said Dr. Charles Rinaldo, the
principal investigator of the
University of Pittsburgh's Pitt
Men's Study.

Rinaldo is an associate profes-
sor of pathology at the Pitt School

vitational;
Lehigh.

.of Medicine and associate profes-

sor of microbiology at Pitt's

‘Graduate School of Public

Health.

Rinaldo said -the reason the
number of infected patients in
Pittsburgh is low is due to the low
number of AIDS victims in this
area. ' '

Other universities involved in
the Multicenter AIDS Cohort
Study arejohns Hopkins Univer-
sity in Baltimore, Northwestern
University Medical School in

Chicago and the University of

California at Los Angeles.

The study also discovered that I

once a person is exposed to the

virus, neither the subsequent fre- »

quency of homosexual contact or
the number of ‘sexual partners
will determine whether or not the
person will contract AIDS.

The Cohort study took place
from April 1984 through Decem-
ber 1985. Rinaldo, in yesterday's
issue of the Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette, said that since then near-
ly 200 of the men have come
down with AIDS.

Rinaldo said they also have I

plans to study women who have
had sexual relations with the men
in thisstudy who were infected
by the virus.

For Phil Moyer, the waiting is
over. »

After a fall term that included
several weeks of campaigning, a
lopsided victory over challenger
Jay Rothstein and several more
weeks of preparation, Moyer offi-

* cially began his term as Student
 Government Board president last

night.
He took the oath from outgo-
ing presidentlim Mumma in front

of an estimated 100 people in the _

Ballroom of the William Pitt
Union.

Also installed were new board
members Vince Altomare‘, Fiora
Boehm, Rose Cardone, Amy
Danziger, George Kontos,
Therese McFadden and Pam
Rich. They join returning board
member Melanie Naro.

’’The 1987 Student Govern-
ment Board has set ‘our aspira-
tions high, and I am confident
that together with the help of this
university's administration and
the inspiration of the student
body, we shall see them to their

fruition,” Moyer said in his’ac—

ceptance speech.

Moyer labeled several priorities
for his board. For starters, he said
he wanted to evaluate the or-
ganizational structure of the
board itself and its standing com-
mittees in an attempt to.strearn-
line the workings of the student

government.

Moyer also seeks to initiate an
information exchange between
his board and the student govern-
ments of other schools in the
Pittsburgh area.

Additionally, Moyer said he

. wishes to create more funds for

student organizations through an

fee.

”I have much optimism fora
distinguished year in student
representation,” he said.

With Moyer’s entrance obvi-
ously comes Mumma’s exit.
Mumma followed Luke Klutchko
as SGB president.

”It has been a year ofchallenge
and insight,” M.umma said in his

farewell speech. ”I wish student’ I

governmenfthe brightest future,”

Moyer commended Mumma
and his board,iand said he hopes
to continue pursuing several pro-
grams Mumma’s board initiated.

”We will be fully engaging the
escort service, as well as seeing
to the completion of the neon

sculpture," he said._ A
Moyer’s term extends through

the fall term of next year. He said
he encourages students to ap-
proach him with their concerns.

His office is located on the
sixth floor of the William Pitt Un-
ion,‘ and he is available Mondays
and Wednesdays from 2-3‘, Tues-
days and Thursdays from 3-4 and
Fridays from 2-5 p.m.

French jets raid Lybian airfield in Chad

TRIPOLI, Libya — French jets

bombed a Libyan airfield in:

northern Chad Wednesday, ap-
parently in retaliation for Libyan
air raids against French installa-
tions in the southern part of
Chad.

Moments after the French raid,
Libya reported that it struck back
at the French—controlled town of
Kouba Oulanga, but a French
spokesman denied any attack oc-
curred. ,

The raids represent the latest
hostilities between the two coun-
tries tied to the Chadian civil war,

‘ which has been going on sporad-

ically since I967.

France has set up bases in the
southern part of Chad to counter
Libyan bases in the northern part.
Analysts say the French do not
want to see Libya gain control of
the country, which is rich in cer-
tain raw materials that France
imports. —

A French spokesman said that
Wednesday's raid ”neutralized"

_ a Libyan radar site and that the

French planes suffered, no
damage.

India says lack of
safeguards caused
Bhopal accident

BHOPAL, India — The Indian
government charged Thursday
that Union Carbide Corp. knew
of the potential for disaster at its
Bhopal plant but did not take the
proper safeguards to head off
disaster.

More than 2,500 people died
when deadly methyl isocyanate
gas leaked from the plant on Dec.

3, 1984, in the worst industrial
disaster in world history. Hun-
dreds of thousands more were
injured.

Union Carbide, however, said
the accident was not caused by
any faults in the plant's design but
by sabotage.

The company said someone
deliberately put water into a gas
storage tank, causing the massive
escape of gas. _

The Indian statement said,”The
Carbide statement is an attempt
to obscure the material facts of
thisaction with irrelevant facts,
improbable detail and blatant
misrepresentation.”

Committee studying to
improve use of grants

By Dirk Kaufman
Managing Editor

An ad hoc committee formed
to study the role of principle .in—
vestigators in research projects
reported on several complaints
and points of confusion involved
in projects at Pitt at yesterday's
Faculty Assembly meeting. ‘

A principle investigator is that
person who applies for _ grant
money and heads a group of
researchers on a given project.

One of the cases committee
chairman Richard Tobias cited in-
volved a professor who was ap-
parently ”needled” by a depart-
ment head who felt equipment
received for a research project
should be used by -all members
of the department.

Tobias also said many principle
investigators complain, of having
to spend too much time hiring
staff for their projects.

”Some receive a grant for six
months of research and spend
three months trying to hire a staff

because of" university employ-
ment policy,” Tobias said.

He said the committee is hop-
ing to reach three general conclu-
sions. The first two involve
guidelines for the principle inves-
tigator and administrators, the
third would be suggestions for in-
forcement of the guidelines.

SOMETIMES I THINK
THATNO (W6 unnee-

WMTA PLEA}

Barbara Shore, president of the A
University Senate said the Faculty
Assembly cannot actually create
the guidelines but only suggest
what might be done in relation to
faculty.

”There is no general statement
by the university for someone
who is under duress bygthe ad-
ministration, a colleague, or any
other person,” Tobias said.

In other business, Shore said
Black Studies Department Chair-
man Dennis Brutus is working on
aclarification to statements made
during the last University Senate
meeting concerning Pitt's
divestment. '

Brutus discussed the negative
effects-divestment can have, but

- fears his statements might be con-
strued to mean he was against
divestment.

Shore said Brutus listed the
”unexpected profit” acquired by
those who buy property and
equipment from those who pull
out of South Africa, among other
drawbacks.

’ Those of you who thought
Wesley Posvar planned to rest
on his laurels after being
" named Co—Pittsburgher of the
Year should think again. lfthe
events of the past year are any
indication, growth and de-
velopment appear to be the
watchwords for '87. Recently,
the University of Pittsburgh
and Presbyterian-University
Hospital joined forces in a
$230 million effort to expand
medical research and health
care in Pittsburgh.

Medical Renaissance, the new
plan provides for a series of
projects to be finished by
mid-1990. Among these are a
nine-level extension of the
center wing of Presby, an
eight—|evel extension to Falk
Clinic and a new nine-level
research facility.
”Pittsburgh has rapidly
emerged as a nationally recog-
nized medical center,” said

Dr. Thomas Detre, Pitt's senior
vice president for Health
Sciences. ”This long-range
plan has been developed to
accomodate the exponential
growth in the areas of cancer
treatment, transplantation,
genontology, complex cardi-
ovascular disease treatment
and trauma.”

Economically, the new

project should be a major .

plus. According to Posvar,
”The expansion of Pittsburgh's

-academic medical complex

will have an immediate and
lasting’ impact on the city's
economy. Since the hospitals
and the university have agreed
to use only local contractors
for this project  this will
mean approximately 6,000
construction-related jobs in
the next three years. *
According to George Taber,

loped the new plan, the ex-
pansions have been on the
drawing board for quite a

V. , YourQuest.for the Truth in
Hi Performance Audio and Video Has Ended!

Opus One, Pennsylvania's oldest
and most knowledgeable audio-
video store, has opened a branch
location designed to serve the
needs of students and other dis-
criminating music lovers. This store
is conveniently located right in the
heart of 'Oakland, 3709 Forbes

Avenue, 2nd floor, right across from _

McDonald's. , -

The two major strengths that ele-
vate Opus One above other audio-
video stores are knowledge and
time. ‘

Their extensive knowledge in
both audio and video was not
brought to them by the tooth fairy
it was earned through 28 years of
hard work. Tasso Spanos, the
fo'under_of Opus One, together with
his staff, has installed more stereo
systems, ‘repaired more compo-
nents, and recorded more live con-
certs than all of the Pittsburgh audio
stores, past and present, added up

together! Thousands of practical ex- '

periences have taught them what is
important for good sound and what
is not. Components with flashy
lights, pretty colors, and many con-
trols are not as important to them
as those with natural sound orlclear
pictures.

An extraordinary amount of time
is spent by Opus One to find the
best components. People always
ask them ”what’s new?” The impor-

.tant question should be ”what’s

Opus One" has continually pi-
oneered those components, which
_almost inevitably become classics
-that people proudly listen to for a
decade or more.

An extraordinary amount of time
is also spent on the customer. The

staff of Opus One can answer your .

questions, give you impressive
‘demonstrations, recommend com-

ponents, and their proper installa-'

tion and inform you about the few
important trends. Don't be sur-
prised that you may want to stay
more than an hour on your initial
visit to Opus One. You won't be the

‘ first! -

The extensive research of Opus
‘One will also save you time be-
cause you will not be confused by
several competing products at the
same price. The experts of Opus
One have already weeded ‘out the
bad, the mediocre and even the
very good, to bring you only the
best components in your price
range. 0

' We have found out that absolute-
ly nothing you own can give you
as much enjoyment over the years
as a fine entertainment system.
With complete packages starting at
$499, we are prepared to back up
our claim that when you purchase

from Opus One, you get the best
sound for the money.

Opus One also has a fully
equipped service center that can
handle anything from a broken
boom box to a fine preamp. Their
phone number is 323-0445.

And for you fraternity brothers...
we also have a commercial depart-
ment that is well equipped to han-
dle the special requirements of
sound & videoreinforcement in the
sometimes abusive environment of
the fraternity house. _

Tasso Spanos began Opus One in
1959 because he had a great love
of music and he’ wanted to help
others who love music. When you
want to recreate the beauty and ex-
citement of a live musical perfor-

mance in your home, Opus One is .

the ‘place to begin.

Throughout the year, this location
will also be sponsoring a series of
special events and ads directed at
students, designed to inform and

also to entertain. One in particular V

will be a seminar given by Dave
Belles, one of America's premier
electronics designers, about preamp
and power, amp design and why
some are better sounding than
others.

AIDS funding is

sorely deficient

. At the beginning of the 19805, the AIDS outbreak began, caus-

ing hysteria. There were accusations that God was finally, ._
punishing those whom fundamentalists considered a less-than-

desirable element of the population.

In recent months, those same fundamentalists should have

come to realize that if this were the case, we would have all
fallen from grace. AIDS is no longer an affliction of homosex-
uals and drug addicts. It has become a terrifying possibility for
everyone. \

In the Jan. 12 issue of U5. News and World Report, it was
reported that one of every three cases affects a heterosexual
who does _not use drugs nor is Haitian — a heterosexual who
could be you. ' « J

The Reagan administration, with its emphasis on protecting
the population — evident in its insistance on continuing SDI
research —' has consistently refused to address the epidemic
with the regard it.demands. The time for federal complacency

. has long since passed. The time has come for action to push
. indignant rhetoric, from the spotlight.

In the current budget proposal, there is an additional $123
million allocated for AIDS research, a trifling sum compared
to the total $1 trillion in the spending plan. is AIDS as unim-
portant as‘ those numbers would have us believe? The federal
government must have assumed this is to be the case.

The families of the children killed by AIDS — children who
have "never had sexual intercourse — must feel differently.

If the federal government continues to take the cavalier atti-

. . tude" we have seen so far, the question of defense may become

‘academic.’Corpses need no defense.

.Good luck to the
renew. SG B cabinet

Last night eight members of the Student Government Board

I — and. the SBB president were sworn into office. For the next year,

this group will act as representatives of the student body of the

 University of Pittsburgh. In the past,some board members have ,

fulfilled the minimum of duties which their positions entailed,
leaving the university virtually unchanged for their terms in
office. Not all have been ineffective, certainly.‘ Some have gone
beyond the minimum and served as a leading force in affect-

 . ing changes for the good of the students.

I

We urge our newly inaugurated leaders to look upon their
_position as the mandate of service it is intended to be, and not

as a token office accepted for the purpose of resume-padding ,

or popularity. They should make every effort to learn the needs
of the students and to take specific action on those needs.
It is not enough to say one supports an idea or simply to talk
- about change. Without specific, concrete action, ideas and dis-
cussion are irrelevant. SGB President Phil Moyer said that when
he pursues something, he pursues it to the end. A noble aspi-
' ration, but we will reserve our admiration for specific accom-
plishments. « ‘ '

Moyer said, ,’’I can do something for this university.” Talk‘
V is cheap; Moyer andthe SGB have a responsibility to back their

promises with . acti_on.«.

Don't crawl unde a rock

. Your Wednesday, Jan. 7, edito-
rial by Matt Tolbert "A 4.0 isn't
a guarantee of a prosperous
career" couldn't have come at a
better time or been more "on tar-
get"‘for today's college student.
Of course, grade point is impor-
tant. |t's our measuring stick for
individual academic'accomplish-
ment, (Whether that is good or

bad is a separate question.) and

it probably will always be im-

‘ portant.

But Matt has targeted [and
stressed] two key elements for
students and anyone else seeking
job/career/life success: extracur-
ricular activities and developing
a good work ethic.

Extracurricular activities, in-
cluding clubs, community and
church organizations, athletics,
summer jobs, internships, volun-
teer services, PIP courses, student
government  and any number
 of non-classroom activities, are
vital personal growth and de-

avelopment opportunities. They
J represent the largest category of V
possibilities and options 

  

. LETTERS

' which an individual, can learn,

grow and prepare for the
challenges of a lifetime.

They also represent a quick
way to distinguish the players
from the spectators .. and the
leaders from the followers.

Pitt and Pittsburgh offer thou-
sands of extracurricular opportu-
nities to seek and achieve success
for students each year. 

Opportunities to seek and
achieve success — yes, there is
some trick to landing and
capitalizing on one or more of
these opportunities, but that's
where the work ethic comes in.
You have to do something to get
the opportunity, and you have to
do something with the opportu-
nity. Whether you do nothing,
just the minimum, a good job or"

an all—out effort is a measure of .
your work ethic. It is an attitude .

that _ you adopt, ~ a style you

choose and habits that youmake '

or break. Your work ethic is the
sum of your attitudes and habits
toward work —_— not just for the
pay but any project, assignment,
chore, task or hobby that you un-
dertake. Recruiters know that
what each of us has done in the
past is a good predictor of what
we may do in the future. They
also know that the way we have
done things in the past is a good
guage of how we will do things

.in the future.

At the University Placement
Service we talkwith thousands of
recruiters each year. What Matt
Tolbert learned from one, we
have had reinforced by hundreds.
I hope that by reinforcing Matt's
observations, more Pitt students
wiIl'make the effort to learn and
benefit from these opportunities.
Extracurricular activities and a

good work ethic —.they do make -

a difference.

THE PITT NEWS, Friday, January 9, I987

Ruth advises husband to kiss, or kiss off

Q. I have been married 24
years, and for 12 ofthem my hus-
band has not kissed me. Though
he wants intercourse, he won't
kiss me or let me touch him lov-
ingly. When we had been mar-
ried five years, I had an affair that
lasted a while, then it stopped. A
long time afterwards he got mad
over something and told me he
had followed me and knew
everything. Since then, no affec-
tion. I'd divorce him, but he
won't let me go. What can I do?

A. What do you mean, he
won't let you go? Not that I want
you to leave, but that makes me
curious. I have to guess that you
don't want to leave much be-

cause, in spite of everything, you '

do wish he would kiss you and
let you touch him lovingly. Some
people would ask, "How can you
have intercourse without touch-
ing lovingly?" But of course that
is possible, when all the touching
is related to sex—gratification,
without fondness, tenderness, ap-
preciation.

An open

Dear Ron,
What the hell is happening to
you? I'm very confused.

' I rememberway back to your
original campaign against that
man from Georgia. Iwasin 10th
grade. Sister Mildred, my history
teacher, picked two of us, Chris
Fair and me, to research the two
presidential candidates and to
stage a mock debate. Chris had
to do what’s—his-name from Ge-
orgia, and I had to do you. At first
I knew nothing about you, so I
started to read the papers and to
talk to people like my father, a

staunch Republican, and I start-
ed to think that you were up there -

with Lincoln and Washington.

Anyhow, I won the debate, I '

made a classroom of 10th graders
think real hard, and I became a
born-again Republican before I
was even old enough to vote.
All through your first term, I fol-
lowed everything you did. You
stood for everything I ever want-
ed to be, you were my idol.

TheSEC

Imagine if someone told you
that you had done something
wrong and, as a penalty, you
were being fined $100 million.

Preposterous, right? But that is
exactly what has happened to
Ivan Boesky, a Wall Street
wheeler-dealer who was caught
by the Securities and Exchange
Commission in an insider-trading
invesitigation. Boesky agreed to
pay the $100 million. By all ac-
counts, even after paying up, he
will remain an incredibly wealthy
man-

What makes this more than a
business page story is the mean-
ing behind the headlines. Boesky,
who made his fortune in the cor-
porate takeover arena, amassed
the money in ways the normal
working American cannot even
comprehend. The average person
in this country does his or her
best to scrape by, to scrimp and
save and do his or her level best
to put a few dollars aside after the
rent or the mortgage has been
paid. -

It always seemed asif the Ivan

Boeskys of this world were laugh-

You have to say to him, "If you

‘want to keep me and want me

sexually, then you should treat
me like a woman you like and
love and think well of. If I stay
with you as a sort of ill-liked, bad-
ly treated sex slave, that doesn't
speak well of either of us. If you
don't like me, don't have sex with
me and don't hold on to me the
way you do.”

Don't go into that affair of 18
or 19 years ago —- that's
ridiculous and no longer has any-
thing to do with it. If he wanted
to make a fuss about that, the
right time was when he found
out. Now he enjoys having that
as an excuse for this behavior he
has made into a habit. I would
say not to have sex with him un-
less he begins to-treat you nice-
ly, and you can say to him,
"Don't be embarrassed. If you
want to be nice to me, I'll accept
it.” '

Certain suspicions bother me,
however, and make me think you
can't hold out on him to get him

to change his way of approach-
ing you. Possibly you like sex
with him too much to hold out,
and he knows that. In that case,
you need to talk to a mental
health professional about chang-
ing your own reaction to the way
he acts; otherwise he has you,
like Svengali —- or the only good
plumber in town — in his pow-
er. And possiblyyou are afraid of
him; physically or psychological-

ly, he has the upper hand. If the
latter is the case, you have to see
a social worker about getting out
from under that domination.

Q. I have trouble maintaining
erections, and also I have prema-
ture orgasms. Do any of the
creams you see on sale help with
this problem?

A. No. First, they don't work.
Second, I don't think any cream
even claims to help with main-
taining an erection — all I have
seen claimed is to retard ejacula-
tion. Sensation—dulling prepara-
tions that make sex boring not
only delay your climax, they get
on your partner's pleasure-
sensing zones and interfere with
her enjoyment, too. You really
have to see a sex therapist. Don't
waste time and money on fake
”remedies." .

Q. I am 81 and would like to
have some sex at home, but I am

rworried about maintaining an

erection. Is there any kind of food
or exercise that would help with
this?

A. If a food helps you, use it —-
but you write and tell me what it
is. If you are 81, congratulations
on that and on still being interest-
ed. You have heard about oys-
ters. Oysters have helped men, I

am sure, for the reason that the I

men have faith in them. The ef-
fect was psychological. Chemi-
cally, hormonally, no one knows
of anything in oysters that pro-
motes sex, but I don't say not to
try them.

There are no exercises like

pushups or situps for improving '

erections. In sex therapy there are
certain procedures or kinds of
homework that are used to im-
prove sexual. functioning, and
these are called exercises. They
involve the man and his partner
together, carrying out the ther-
apist's instructions (at home, not

in the therapist's office). The sen- .

sate focus exercises help the part-
ners to get into the right frame of
mind for good sex: pleasing and
pleased, low-key, undemanding,
relaxed. 4 ‘

letter from a disgruntled Republican

You breezed through that first
term. You had more popular sup-
port than almost any other presi-
dent of the 20th century. Then,
1984 rolled around. Your cam-
paign was a public relations
coup. You had every Democrat
in the country running for cover.
It was great fun to watch. I was
caught up in the middle of all of
it, too. I joined an organization
called ”The Fritzbusters," I got
people to register to vote, I donat-
ed money to your campaign. I did
all of this for you, Ron, my idol.

' But look at you now. I know it's
wrong to kick a man when he's
down, but I'm going to do it
anyhow.

This little mess in Iranhas real-
ly proven to be your Achilles’
heel. The Teflon president final-
ly has something sticking to him.
Since all of this became public
knowledge, you've essentially
lost most of your popular support.
Face it, nobody likes. you any-
more. You've betrayed our trust.

It's like when you break up with
an old girlfriend. You start notic-
ing things about her that you
couldn't stand when you were
together, but they never bothered
you. But now that you've broken
up, you really start noticing
things, and they really start to
bother you, you know?

When you were quoted as say-
ing, "Surround yourself with the
best people you can find,
delegate your authority, and

don't ask questions," we just sat
there, almost in some sort of odd
trance. We should have seen that
that quote was an open admis-
sion that you were not running
this country; your advisers were.
We shouldhavelseen that that's
what has been going on all along.

Well, Ron, it seems we've
broken the spell that kept us en-
tranced for the last six years. Your
old allies are starting to read, ac-
tually read, the newspaper arti-
cles that tell us what your budget
proposals entail. We're starting to
listen to your critics. We're
remembering campaign promises
that never materialized. Remem-
ber back in 1980, you told all of
us that you were goingto balance
the budget by 1984. Hereit is
three -years past your deadline,
and you've announced your new
budget. Is a deficit the size of the
one you_'ve racked up the defini-
tion of "balanced budget?" Help
me out here, Ron. I

And another thing. How can

you rationalize some of your pro-  “

posed cuts in social services? You
want to cut another $3.5 billion
from subsidies granted to college

students. People are dropping out -

of school allover the place now

because they can't come up with g 

the money. Is slashing the pit-

tance we get now going to help A. I I

things? We're becoming a high-
tech society. In order to be suc-

puter in every home do if nobody

knows how to use it? By not en- .0  '

couraging young people to get
educations, you are cheating our
generation of valuable resources
for the future. Think about it.
Please.

Well, Ron, you've really dis-
sappointed me, and I'm not alone . .
in that disappointment. Oh yeah,"    -g."
I almost forgot. I hope your i.nt,e's-_

should give up Boesky’s millions

ing at the rest of America — at the
people who were trying to do
things straight. Ivan Boesky and
his compatriots were so sly and
so clever; they must have gotten
a real chuckle out of the way
mainstream America looked at its
finances. ‘ ~ ,

Last year, Boesky was the com-
mencement speaker for the
School of Business Administra-
tion at the University of Califor-
nia, Berkeley. He said to his
audience: "Creed is all right, by
the way. I want you to know that.
I think greed is healthy. You can
be greedy and still feel good

about yourself." - -

Newsweek magazine, in com-
menting on that speech, wrote:
"The strange_st thing, when we
come to look back, will be not
just that Ivan Boesky could. say
that at a business school gradua-
tion, but that it was greeted with
laughter and applause."

Now the appluase is fading,
and the SEC has gotten Boesky to
agree to pay the $100 million
fine.

I got to thinking about $100

million. There are so many peo-
ple in this country who are in
desperate need — people to
Whom the world of Ivan Boesky
must sound as foreign as if it were
being depicted in some outer
space movie. I wondered who
was going to benefit from the
$100 million.

$0 I called the SEC in Washing-
ton and talked to spokesman
Chiles Larson. . '

"There are two elements here,"
Larson said. "The first $50 mil- A

lion represents illegal profits that

Boesky allegedly made on insider

those persons who have a claim

I — who were on the other side of

the trade.

"The second $50 million goes
to the United States Treasury. It
just goes into the general fund.
The general fund is basically the
fund that pays to keep the govern-

ment running. The funds go to.

anything in the government. It's
like a big vault. Conceivably, it
could even come right back here
to help with funding of the SEC."

Somehow, though, it would

seem nice if Boesky’s $100 mil- '

lion could go into a special fund
to provide help to those Ameri-
cans in desperate need of food,
shelter and clothing. This is a lot
of money — $100 million. The
government didn't have it before,
and now that the SEC has fined
Boesky, it would be fitting to al-
locate the money to people who
really need it. . _

It would be a richly symbolic

l BUCKLEY AMENDMENT

Section 438 ofthe General Education Provisions Act, as
amended by Section 513 of Public Law 93-568, referred to as
the ”Privacy Rights of Parents and Students,” (more common-
ly called the ”Buckley Amendment”) requires that the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh give notice to parents and students of the
following information. 1

The Buckley Amendment is designed to protect the privacy
of students. In order to do so, these provisions are binding on
the University:

- Individual student records include only information
necessary and relevant to the educational purposes of the in-
stitution. 2 '

I - Student‘ records are open for inspection by students, and by
parents of students under 18 years of age upon request, with
the exception that letters of recommendations written prior to
January 1, 1975,remain confidential. Additionally, specific
documents that students have waived their right toinspect re-
main confidential. '

- Students have a right tochallenge the accuracy of rt ds.

- The institution may not release student records outside the
institution without student consent, unless one of several ex-

ceptions applies.

- Requests external to the institution for information regarding
students should be documented, as should releases of student
. information.

:-I The University may establish categories of information
known as ”Directory Information” and release this information
upon request by individuals external to the institution. This may

A be done only after students are provided the opportunity to re-
 quest exclusions from their information being released. Direc-
 tory information includes the following information: Name,

I  Address, Telephone Number, Ma-jor Field of Study, Academic

. honors, Membership or Offices held with Organizations, Par-
3 «ticipation in Athletics, Honors or Awards.

LOS ANGELES — Dollar for

that raised more than $51 million
singing ”We Are the World.”
Dollar for dollar, too, no or-
ganization faced so much. initial

Marty Rogol, director of US

executives of charitable organiza-
tions shortly after the record was
released. One questioner was
blunt: ”Who do you think you
are, to all of a sudden, out of‘no-
where, run a relief operation?”
Despite initial skepticism, USA
for Africa won the admiration of
established agencies for its tight-
fisted management and innova-
tive strategies.

”There were a lot of resent-

_ments about us because of who

the money comes from,” said
Rogol. ”Here are these organiza-
tions, working away, doing all
their good work, and then here
comes a bunch of musical stars,
and all of a sudden, they’ve_got
to deal with us.”

on sale early in March.

People who normally wouldn't
drop a dime in a poor box bought
the album or the single, the T-
shirts or the video, or simply
made a donation, and the organi-
zation said in October the total
collection was $51.2 million.

USA forAfrica~decided in May
that its few top people with some
charity experience could not han-
dle the flood of money coming in
and requests for how to send it
out. .

”We had several choices when
we first started, one of which
would have been to have divid-
ed the money among x—number
of agencies and just give it out.
Or the other extreme would be
to set up a new agency,” said
Rogol. ”We chose something in
between.”-

USA for Africa approached the
United Nations and various relief
agencies, but not to hand over
money.

”What we did say to them was,
‘You definitely know more than
we do about what's going on. So
let's set up a system that uses that
information and your experience,

' but still allows us to maintain ac-

countability,” said Rogol.

Band Aid meets unforeseen difficulties

By Larry Thorson

Associated Press Writer

LONDON — When rock start-
ed the money rolling to save the
starving in Africa, Bob Geldof’s
foundations began receiving a
flood of proposals for projects
touted as long-term remedies for
famine.

Build bridges and dams, vac-
cinate huge populations, drill
wells, replenish stocks of cattle
killed by drought, buy hospital
equipment, provide seed and
beekeeping expertise, support or-
phanages, train health workers,
help develop politically con-
troversial resettlement areas in
Ethiopia — these and many more

 ideas were among more than 700
 projects eventually considered.

Most were rejected.

”We all felt it would be much
easier than it has been,” said Pen-
ny Jenden, director of the Band
Aid Trust, the central foundation
that also handles Live Aid money
from the United States and from
charities in Canada and Australia.

"Here was an Africa starving,
a need for development. We
thought there were projects just
sitting there waiting for money,
we had the money, we would
find the good projects and fund
them. It hasn't worked out that
way.” -

Rock aid for Africa's starving
millions began in 1984 when
Geldof, leader of The Boomtown
Rats, got some of his colleagues
together to record a song about
Ethiopian famine victims, ”Do
They Know It's Christmas?”

The Irish pop singer called his
project Band Aid, and the record
was a best—sel|er.

Live Aid, a trans-Atlantic rock
concert in July I985 that originat-
ed from London and Philadel-
phia, the record and some other
projects raised $110 million. Gel-

dof promised to be non-political, '
humanitarian and non—bureau— -

cratic in distributing the money.

He and his advisers spent $43
million on immediate relief and
decided to spend the remaining
60 percent of the $110 million on

long—term development. But with
only five volunteers, sifting
through more than 700 project
proposals clearly was an impos-
sible job.

The five volunteers were sup-
plemented with a committee of
10 British experts who have
credentials in relief work, anthro-
pology, public health, epidemiol-

ogy, agriculture and
development.

Jenden, an anthropologist, said
proposals were also screened by
staff members at the Center for
Immigration Policy and Refugee
Assistance at Georgetown
University in Washington, D.C.

Despite Geldof’s desire to be
non-bureaucratic, a four—person

progress reports were required;
projects were to aim at making
beneficiaries self-sufficient; and
local people were to participate.

Proposals were reviewed in
New York by InterAction and the
United Nations Office for Emer-
gency Operations in Africa. Only
proposals approved by both
agencies were submitted to USA
for Africa for final consideration.

’’It has worked unevenly in
some countries, but it was better
than just giving the money to
whomever came through the
door,” said lnterAction’s Davies.

”They could be criticized be-
cause it took a long time for a de-

cision to be made, but I think it

was an asset,” said Ann McKu-
sick, director of resource de-
velopment for World Vision
International. ”They gave
authority to the people closest to
the action.”

USA for Africa officials said
they have delivered millions of
dollars more than the reported
value of items, thanks to dis-
counts, donations and bargain-

hunting on the world market for
food, medicine and equipment.

”For instance, the first emer-
gency shipment we made to
Ethiopia and Sudan was reported
at the amount we paid for it —
$618,000,” said Tracy Gordon,
USA for_Africa director of grants.
”But its actual retail value was
$3.4 million.”

That shipment included
240,000 pounds of food and
medicine, destined for Sudan and
Ethiopia aboard a chartered 747.

Gordon said cooperation with
Bob Ge|dof’s Live Aid organiza-
tion saved money. A lot of USA
for Africa goods bought in Eu-
rope, he said, were given free
transit to Africa on cargo ships
leased by Live Aid.

USA for Africa was also among
several charity organizations that
contributed to a $1 million fund,
elected CARE to represent them
and obtained substantial dis-
counts on trucks from Mercedes-
Benz and British Leyland.

”The difference between com-
ing to these companies individu-
ally with $50,000 in hand, or as
a group with $1 million, is pretty
substantial,” Gordon said. I

ly agree we should be so lean ad-
ministratively,” Jenden said, ”but
we are constrained by promises
to the public.”

Administrative expenses are
paid not from money donated by
rock fans, she emphasized in an
interview with The Associated
Press, but from corporate spon-
sorships and other donations.

Final decisions on projects are
madeby boards of trustees of the
Band Aid Trust, which handles
money raised in Britain and most
of the rest of the world, and the
Live Aid Foundation, which dis-
penses money raised in the Unit-
ed States. Geldof and rock pro-
moter-Harvey Goldsmith are on
both boards, and Jenden handles
the flow of information about
projects to and from the boards,

‘the field staff and the agencies

that spend the money.

Jenden said the majority of the
700 proposals were rejected,
some of them immediately. ”If an
agency was new to the country 
and was using Band Aid as a label
to get in, that's not justified,” she
said.

/.

The biggest grant the organiza-
tion made was $3 million for a
UNICEF program to immunize
children, andlthe smallest was

"$4,169 to maintain water pumps

in refugee camps in eastern
Sudan, said Band Aid spokesman
Bernard Doherty.

The organization is now deeply
involved with long—term projects.
It has committed $26.7 million to
137 projects after rejecting 539 of
712 proposals.

By year's end, Band Aid could
count on being able to spend
about $41 million more, plus
what it receives from Sport Aid,
which kicked off with a world-
wide ”I Ran the World” event
May 25 and continues to receive
money from eventshere and
there.

Sport Aid reported raising

. about $34'mi|lion, to be split be-

tween Band Aid and UNICEF.

Some projects will run three or
four years, and Band Aid will re-
main in existence while the re-
maining money is spent. Projects
will be supervised in the famine-
hit countries by committees that

Pitt no longer underdog team to Hoyas  

By Christopher Sepesy

Assistant Sports Editor

The times, they are a changin’.
For the first time since the in-
stitution of the Big East confer-
ence, the Pitt Panthers are finally
going into ”big” conference
' games not as the underdogs
against powerhouse teams, but
rather as the favorites.

The Georgetown Hoyas,' the
team which Pitt (ranked 14 by
AP) is meeting tomorrow -at the
Civic Arena at 4 p.m., is one of
these teams. The’»Hoyas have
been the favorites against the
Panthers since Pitt entered the
conference. Georgetown holds a
7-2 Big East series advantage over
Pitt. But this time the tables are
turned. Pitt is indeed the favorite

going into tomorrow's game.

And how does Pitt head coach
Paul Evans feel about this? Sur-
prised, but happy."

”I really didn't know we were
favored in this game. However,
the way that will affect us l don't
think will count for much,” said
Evans. ”We are going to go into
this game the same way we have
all year — prepared as best we

can be, and at the same time cau-
tious enough not to let our feel-
ings run away by themselves and
get too overconfident.”

As of late, both Evans and his
Panthers have been garnering a
lot of skepticism about the way
they have been playing, and the
word ”gamb|ing” has come up
more than once. Gambling in,-the
sense that the Panthers have not

played up to their potential g’ 
against two considerably inferior
teams, Providence and Akron. _
Evans, however, does not think 
this should be a concern. _ ‘

’’If you look all across the .
country, you'll find that a lot of T ‘r
good teams, and I mean really ’
good teams, don't always come A
out so far ahead as they think they. . ' P

After the Panthers’ two point

themselves, ”How many

can fault senior Tico Cooper
for not contributing to the Pan-
ther cause. After two sparkling
performances against Provi-
dence and Akron, it is obvious
the 6-8 Aruba native is turning
out to be a valuable sixth man
for Pitt. —

”Right now,‘ I understand
my role on the team: coming
off the bench-,’»’ said Cooper,
who is averaging 5.3 points
and 4.3 rebounds per game. ’’I
don't mind playing behind Jer-
ome [Lane] and Charles

Cooper's rebounding and
timely foul-shooting (he is se-
cond on the team at 82 per-
cent with 28-34) have played
tunes of late. A
When Smith fouled out with
7:53 left in the game against
‘the Zips, many Pitt followers
thought the -Panthers were in
trouble. But Cooper stepped in
and got some key rebounds,
including the most important

When Cooper came to Pitt
last season, he was supposed
to be the answer for the Pan— ,

But, while he isn't the star

be, Cooper is playing a very
critical bench role for this
team‘ e and playing itvery

’’I credit that to hard work in
the off—season and practice,”
said Cooper; ”But, most im-

Wrestlers win Shippensburg Invitational

By Eric Poole
Staff Writer

Many casual observers of
wrestling think that a wrestling
coach's job extends only to
teaching technique and eliminat-
ing the flaws in a wrest|er’s style.

This view tends to overlook the
strategy involved in amateur
wrestling.

”We’|l play games, especially
in the upper weights,” said Pitt
coach Rande Stottlemyer. The
”games” Stottlemyer refers to in
this case include 190-pounders
Curtis Conner and Chris Nufher.

During the opening introduc-
tions, a coach is“ permitted to

 

have more than one wrestler
named in a given weight class,
and he is permitted to introduce
wrestlers named in more than
one weight classes.

In Wednesday's quadrangular
between Pitt, Morgan State, Ship-
pensburg and Syracuse, Stottle-
myer introduced Conner and
Nufher in the 190 and heavy-
weight classes, allowing himself
to send either one into the match
at either weight class.

Although the Panthers forfeited
the heavyweight class in all three
matches, they beat Morgan State
30-13, Syracuse 29-24 and Ship-
pensburg 39-12.,

”We are going to match up [at

190 and heavyweight],” said
Stottlemyer. ”We try to put them
[Conner and Nufher] in a position
where they have the best chance
to win.”

The most interesting match was
Pitt—Syracuse. Syracuse, which
finished the quadrangular with a
record of 2-1, was ranked 18th in
the country by Amateur Wres-
tling News. (Pitt picked up a few
votes in the latest AWN rating but
was still unranked.)

Pitt gave up 12 points in two of
the first three weight classes, leav-
ing the Panthers on the short end
of a 12-4 score when Pat Santoro
stepped onto the mat for the
142—pound bout.

Santoro, who ran his record to
26-1 Wednesday night, beat the
Orangemen’s Nick Garone by
default in the second period.

”Pat hit a couple of arm bars,
and he [Garone] got hurt,” said
Stottlemyer. ”He was going to
pin him anyway.” Santoro was
leading 10-1 when Garone
defaulted.

Gary Bolin, 8-1 since recover-
ing from an ankle injury which
sidelined him for the first month

superior’ decision at 167, and
Mike Tongel notched an escape
in the closing seconds of his
177-pound match to pick a 3-3
draw.

Here is where the ”games”
came in.

Syracuse also had thegoption to
introduce two wrestlers at each of
the 190- and 177-pound classifi-
cations. But the game had one
last move, and the move was
Pitt's.

The NCAA rulebook states that
the home team has to be the first
to put their wrestler on the mat.
Since the match was held in‘Ship—
pensburg, the matter of who
would be the home and visiting
teams was decided by a coin toss
before the match.

”We won the toss and took vi-
sitors,” said Stottlemyer. ”That
really helped us out.”

Because Pitt was the visiting
team, Stottlemyer could wait un-
til the Orange wrestler was on the
mat before deciding whether to
send out Conner or Nufher.

The Orange sent out Mike
Narewski. Pitt sent out Conner.
Narewski got a good view of the
ceiling of the Shippensburg gym
as Conner clinched a Panther vic-
tory 1:45 into his match.

Stottlemyer pointed out that Pitt
had to deal with adversity when
they lost 12 points in the 118-
and 134-pound weight classes.

”Brian [O’Korn] got caught,
and so did Alan [Utter]. But we
showed a lot of character by com-
ing back in the middle weight
classes,” Stottlemyer said.

Pitt travels to Lehigh on Satur-
day in what will be a homecom-

V ing for Santoro. The Panther

142-pounder’s father and brother
wrestled for the Engineers.

’’It should be interesting. Le-
high is ranked in the Top 10,”
said Stottlemyer, while pointing
out that the Panthers tied Lehigh
last year and beat them in
1984-85.

Stottlemyer promises more
”games" against Lehigh and for
the rest ‘of the season.

”Sometimes they don't work,
and I look like a jerk.” _

On Wednesday, though, Stot-
tlemyer looked like a genius.

Senior Tyner an
66

By Kelley Butt

Staff Writer

The Pitt Lady Panther basket-
ball team never heard of Jenny
Tyner five years ago. And why
should they have?

She wasn't here.

Tyner, more affectionately
known as J.T. to her teammates,
signed a basketball letter-of—intent

_ out of high school with North-

eastern Louisiana State Universi-
ty. But she didn't last long there.

The Centerville, Ohio native
couldn't adjust to her new col-
lege coach. ”I simply didn't get
along with the coach [Linda
Harper]. I left because I thought
I'd be able to perform better if I
could relate with the coach bet-
ter,” said Tyner.

So, after one season at North-
eastern Louisiana_State, Tyner
transferred to Pitt. "And the Lady
Panthers are more than pleased
with her choice. Through the first
11 games of this season, Tyner,
a 6-5 senior center, was averag-
ing 10.7 points and 4.8 rebounds
per game.

But it's more than just playing
and scoring baskets that has
made Tyner happy at Pitt. She
found a coach she could get
along with.

”Coach [Kirk] Bruce and I are
two mature people, and if there
is a problem, we can talk about
it,” said Tyner. ”He communi-
cates well with his players.”

However, it does seem unusual
for a 6-5 senior to be a reserve,
rather than a starter. Neverthe-

lenny [T yner] simply
can't play effective
defense when she has
three or four fouls on
her in the first half.

— Kirk Bruce

less, Tyner has yet to see herself
in the starting line—up this season.

Bruce pointed toward Tyner’s
inconsistency as one of the rea-
sons for her reserve role. ”Jenny
has had a season of ups and
downs,” said Bruce. ”She had
three 25—plus point games [early
in the season]. However, now
she seems to be stuck in a scor-
ing draught that has lasted for the
past several games."

The statistics back that up.
Tyner has only been able to
produce an average of 5.5 points
per game in her last four outings,
while in the first six games, she
averaged 14.1 points.

Both Bruce and Tyner agree
that foul trouble keeps her off the
court. Going into last night's
game against Syracuse, Tyner had
fouled out of three games this
year

”Jenny simply can't play effec-
tive defense when she has three
or four fouls on her in the first
half,’’ said Bruce. ”We’ve been
bringing her off the bench in or-
der to keep her out of foul
trouble."

The Lady Panthers’ game plan
is designed to give Tyner quality

unlikely reserve

minutes and still keep her out of
foul trouble.

If that means a reduction in
playing time, Bruce has no
qualms about doing just that.
Tyner has been averaging only
17.3 minutes of playing time per
game this season.

However, despite her foul
problems, Bruce said that Tyner
is one of the most improved play-
ers on the Lady Panther squad.

Tyner agrees. "I am most
pleased with my offensive play.
I am more aggressive now than
I was last year. I'm definitely less
timid. I have no fear of being
pushed,” said Tyner. ”But, in
comparison with my offensive
game, my defensive game needs
some work.”

It is obvious that offense is
definitely Tyner’s strong suit.

Tyner, a psychology major,
hopes to continue her graduate
education at Pitt in the fall.

However, she sees her basket-
ball days dwindling down rapid-
ly. ”I love the sport. I wouldn't be
out there if I didn’t,” said Tyner.
”Its been a good experience and
it hasmade me stronger both on
and off the court. When the
basketball is finished, it's the
friendships that have formed that
I will remember.”

Speaking to Tyner, one gets the
feeling that there is no ”me first”
attitude on the Pitt women's
basketball team.

”Through the tough times, we
keep each other going,” said
Tyner. ”We’re closest of friends

.. we're teammates.”

Pitt track
Invitational
tomorrow

By Celeste Phillips

For The Pitt News

Pitt students have another
reason to trek up Cardiac Hill,
for something other than a
Panther basketball game. Fitz-
gerald Field House opens its
doors at 12:30 Saturday after-
noon for the invitational In-
door Track Meet.

This weekend’s Pitt Invita-
tional will feature five of Pitt's
six All-Americans in hurdler
Eric Cannon, miler Bob Wein-
er, 600—meter runner Dave
Moore, 1000—meter runner Joe
Daniels and haIf—mi|er Tim
Manes. Pitt's All-World runner
Lee McRae will not be par-
ticipating in the event.

Calling it a ”warm-up”
meet, Pitt head coach John
Vasvary said he will be able to
see where the team stands be-
fore entering the highly tout-
ed Kodak lnvitational at
Eastern Tennessee next week.

”We’re just trying to get
everyone together and see
where we are after vacation,"
Vasvary said. ”We want to
have a race under our belts be-
fore we go to East Tennessee.”

Cleveland State will be Pitt's
only opponent in tomorrow's
meet.

will in certain games,” said
Evans. ’’It is true that I think we
need to work some more on our

consistency, but no team plays 4

great all the time, and with us I
don't think it should be a concern
at all.”

Perhaps, though, it should be
a concern, because tomorrow's
team is not the Xavier Musketeers
or the Akron Zips, but George-
town, a team famous for being
able to bounce back from a
defeat and press until victory is
achieved.

This was evident in the Hoyas
60-46 win Wednesday night
against St. John’s after losing by
21- points at home to Seton Hall
last Saturday. And they just may
be starting on a roll.

But Panther sophomore point
guard Mike Goodson thinks

otherwise and seems to be fol-'

lowing Evans’ principle - going
into , this game cautiously, yet
well prepared.

“Georgetown is a good team
and has a history of being a strong
team, but I don't think they can
beat us.— not with the way we
have beeniplaying lately,” said
Goodson. ”We’ve got good drive
and good execution and we're

_ coming off of some wins, and we

may be on a roll ourselves.”

But another historical aspect
that Georgetown always brings
with them is that Hoya head
coach John Thompson never
likes to present an unprepared
team, and judging from the St.
John's game, this again seems
evident.

Despite the crushing loss to Se-
ton Hall, Georgetown is still 10-1
overall, and they are always a
threat with one of the best play-
ers in America — 6-7 senior for-
ward Reggie Williams.

Williams is Georgetown’s star,
averaging 22.7 points and 9.2 re-
bounds per game. He is the
Hoyas’ seventh all-time leading
scorer, 11th al|—time assist leader
and 12th all-time leading re-
bounder. Pitt must play Williams
tough on the defensive end of the
floor because he has the ability to
dominate the game.

Another starter the Panthers
will have to watch is 6-4 guard
Perry McDonald, who is averag-
ing 11.4 points and 5.8 rebounds
per game. McDonald has already
proven he can — and will —

THE PITT NEWS, Friday, January 9, I987

Walkons content just sitting and watching

By Teresa Varley

For The Pitt News

Editor's Note:This is the first in
a two part series on the walk-on
players presently on the men's
basketball team. The second will
be printed next week.

It's a Wednesday afternoon on
the Pitt campus, and most of the
students have packed their bags
and headed home for the Christ-

. mas holiday. Finals are over and

it is a time for the students to take
abreak and relax —- well, for

A most students it is.

The Pitt basketball team spent
this day the same as any other -
pracfﬁing. You know what they
say, practice makes perfect, and
that is for what Pitt coach Paul
Evans strives.

Every player on the team hus-
tles and gives 100 percent at each
practice. They know that is the
only wayto survive — and sur-
vive they have. ''

One of the Pitt assistant
coaches is standing under the
hoop, giving the players a chance
to look good in their teammates’
‘eyes. If they hit on a free throw,
the team does not have to sprint
up and down the court. If they
miss, well, you know what
happens. "

Scott Colombo, a 5-8 guard
from Altoona, Pa., goes to the
line. You can see the look of de-
termination on his face. The ball
leaves his hands and a few of his
teammates start up court. Swish.
The same players step back and
give Colombo their approval.
They are spared again. Colombo,
along with Jon Luther, Pat
Cavanaugh, John Rasp and Bill
Osborn, is a walk-on for the
team. When Evans went looking
for some talent to fill the roster,

. he found it in all of these athletes.

Although he hasn't played
since his senior year at Altoona,
when Colombo found out about
the tryouts he jumped at the

chanceto be a Panther. Last year

he took films of the practices and
-games for the team, and although
he is seeing the game from a
different angle this year, his film-
ing is'what got him involved.
”I went up to the Field House
to talk to coach and see if I could

the women's track team, ad-
rmits that his squad’s purpose
is about thesame as the men's.
Although they will not be
competing against another
women's team, Lewis said he
hopes totune up for the Kodak
Invitational. .
”We want to get times to
qualify for the ECAC [Eastern
Collegiate Athletic Confer-
ence],” Lewis explained.

‘ Lewis also said that this
meet will help his team to pre-
pare for the tough schedule
ahead. _

"This is the first meet of the
continuous season,” he said.
”We’ll be running every,
weekend starting this week.”

Pitt's women's team is a
young one, featuring
600-meter runner Gloria
Azeke and hurdler Debbie

Bonnen_

- You loo, can write fo

   

film again this year,” Colombo
said. ”I saw,-some friends of mine
up there and when they told me
they were trying out for the team,
I decided to do it. I figured I had
nothing to lose and everything to
gain. It really has become a
dream come true for me.”

Colombo, who is hoping to get
into physical therapy at Pitt, has
always been a Pitt fan in Penn
State country. His father teaches
at Penn State's Altoona campus,
but the blue and gold won out.
As a matter of fact, it might have
some of thelpeople in Altoona
changing their colors.

Like ‘Colombo, being part of

the Pitt team has special meaning _

for Luther. The sophomore guard
from Rochester, Pa., has not
played since his high school
years. He transferred to Pitt from
Allegheny College, where he sat
out a year because circumstances

kept him from playing. He, too,
is seeing the game from a differ-
ent angle. Last year he sat in the
Pitt student section and watched.
This year, he is not only Courtside
but is also spending time on the
coun.

”It has really filleda void for
me,” Luther said with sincerity.
”I had the desire in my heart to
play. I felt like something was
missing.”

Luther received a lot of en-
couragement from his family, but
there is one other person who
really helped him along. Greg
Maslek, the father of Panther
Steve Maslek, is the one who
convinced Luther to go out for
the team. He worked at a law
firm with the elder Maslek and
his support was the key.

”He inspired me," Luther ad-

mitted. ”I didn't believe in my
ability, but he did. In my heart,

I knew I wanted to do it, and he
really wanted me to make it.”

A high point for Luther was
when the team had an intrasquad
scrimmage at Rochester High
School. It was a homecoming for
him, but it was also something
more.

’’It was the greatest feeling,”
Luther said. ”The team escorted
me into the gym and the fans
were super. It was then thatl real-
ly felt like a part of the team, and
it made me feel a lot better about
playing for Pitt.”

Another walk-on who feels
good about playing for Pitt is
Cavanaugh, and he really wants
to make an impact on Panther
fans before he graduates. The
freshman guardfrom Grove City,
Pa., was also a walk-on for the
football team. One of the goals
he has set for himself is to be the
starting quarterback, and, with his

dedication and determination, it
is a goal that is attainable.

Like his fellow walk-ons, he
puts in many hours practicing
and learning. He knows he might
not break into the starting lineup,
but that does not hold him back.

”I just want to be the best that
I can be," Cavanaugh quietly
commented. ”It is a challenge,
but it can also be fun. I want to
help the team win, that's the bot-
tom line. I'm glad the coaches"
have the confidence in me to get
the‘ job done for them on a day-
to-day basis."

In the Panthers’ game against
Robert Morris, Cavanaugh played
13 minutes, collecting two as-
sists, one point and a rebound.

Cavanaugh came to Pitt from
West Point Prep, where he was
an All—State selection in high

school in both basketball and 1

football.

Staff Writer

Coaches can attribute their
teams’ successes to many factors.
Pitt men's swim coach Fred

« Lewis can attribute much of his

team's success (5-0 record) to the
fine leadership of senior co-
captain Tom Shaulinski.

”A lot of kids talk about doing

hard things, but Shaulinski actu—\

ally goes out and does them,”
said Lewis. ”His key to success
is the very positive attitude he
maintains all the time and his
desire to lead the team by
example.”

Shaulinski has experienced a
great deal of success in the pool
this season. He is swimming bet-
ter than ever and can boast of an
excess of first—place finishes in the
first five meets this season.

Shaulinski stressed that things
have not always been so good for
him. He started taking swimming

lessons at the age of five, and he-

competed in community summer
and winter league meets until age
15.

”At that time, I wasn't very in-
terested in the sport and didn't do
very well,” said Shaulinski. ”We
lived near a pool, and it was the
/thing to do.’ I more or less just
went through,the motions.”

Although Shaulinski decided to .

get involved with his high school

swimmingteam in Fairport, N.Y.,
he had a slow start in his fresh-
man year. Things started to turn
around in his sophomore season.
His times dropped consistently,
and by his senior year, he was
part of the High School All-
American 400—yard freestyle relay
team.

Shaulinski then chose to attend
Pitt and swim for the Panthers.
”Coming into Pitt, I didn't feel
that my times were all that great,”
said Shaulinski. ’’It was like go-
ingfrom a rookie league to the
majors. At the start of my fresh-
man year, I wasn't winning, and
I was getting beat around pretty
badly. Then my times started to
drop, and I started doing better in
races. I think this was in part be-
cause I was swimmingout of fear
—— the fear of failure. I strive to do
my best in everything I do.”

‘Shaulinski gained confidence
that season and was among the
top four finishers in the 200-yard
freestyle that year at the Big East
Championships.

Shaulinski has made his most
significant gains in swimming
during this, his senior season.

Lewis classifies him as a
middle-distance sprinter due to
his versatility and ability to swim
the 100-, 200- and 500-yard
freestyles.

Shaulinski is most succesful in
his favorite event, the 200-yard

He is also a favorite to take first
place in that event in the Big East
Championships this_year.

But don't think of this guy as an
individualist. Shaulinski always
puts the team's goals ahead of his
personal goals.

”Team-wise, we have to con-
centrate on beating Penn State
before we focus our attention on
the Big East Championships,”
said Shaulinski. ”Sure, I want to
do well, but I figure when I'm do-

Broncos’ Reeves getssome simple advice

By John Mossman -
AP Sports Writer

DENVER — Dan Reeves has
been to five previous Super
Bowls as a player and assistant
coach for the Dallas Cowboys.

If his Denver Broncos manage
to get past the Cleveland Browns
in the AFC championship game
Sunday, he will make it six. But
it's far from becoming old hat. In
fact, he has been assured it will
be a completely new experience.

”|’ve been in this situation as
a player and an assistant, and it's
a tremendous feeling,” said
Reeves. ”But I talked to [Chica-
go Bears coach] Mike Ditka, and
he said until you experience it as
a head coach, it's an entirely
different feeling. I'm anxious to
find out exactly what he means.”

NBC

a winner

as well as
Penn State

By Rick Warner

Associated Press Sports Writer

The Fiesta Bowl national cham-
pionship game produced two
clear-cut winners: Penn State and
NBC. The Nittany Lions beat Mi-
ami on the field, and NBC’s tele-
cast of the game clobbered its
competition over the airwaves.
. Last Friday night's game was
watched in more American
hdmes -— 21.9 million — than
any college football game in
history. .

f’We’re happy, and I'm sure so

‘are the advertisers, the Sunkist

Fiesta Bowl people and [Penn
State coach] Joe” Paterno,” NBC
spokesman Tom Merritt said.

The, game easily beat non-
sports programming on the other’
networks. NBC’s telecast
received a 25.1 rating, compared
with 18 for CBS and 11.8 for
ABC.

Ric LaCivita, CBS’s coordinat-

V ing producer for college football,

had questioned NBC’s pregame
projection of a record Fiesta,Bowl
audience.

”l admit it, -1 was shocked by
the numbers,” he-said. ’’I thought
people would be a little tired of
football after all the New Year's

' games. I guess you can never un-
derestimate people's appetite for -

a major sporting event like a na-
tional championship game.” 1
The previous viewing record

was 21.8 million homes for the,

1980 Rose Bowl between Ohio
State and Southern California.
That game had a higher rating
(28.6) than this year's Fiesta Bowl
but was watched in fewer homes
because there‘ are more television
sets today.

NBC had estimated that 70 mil-
lion people would watch all or

A part of the Fiesta Bowl. Merritt

stuck with the prediction after the

ratings were released Monday,

but the exact audience won't be
known until the network receives
more detailed, information in
several weeks. '

Reeves and Ditka are close
friends and golfing buddies, and
they also talked strategy this
week. Denver did not play the
Browns in the regular season, but
Chicago did and won 41-31. The
Bears, last year's Super Bowl
champions, were knocked out of
the playoffs last week.

”Mike said Cleveland was one
of the best teams he faced all
year,” Reeves said. ”He warned
me that the Browns try to get you
in some unusual matchups and

then take advantage of them.”
Did Ditka offer any advice?
”Win,” said Reeves.
Reeves knows the dangers of
looking ahead, but he also was

willing to discuss the Road to
Pasadena and a possible Super
Bowl matchup against either the
Washington Redskins or the New
York Giants.

”We’re not awed by the two
teams left in the NFC,” he said.
”We've played both of them, and
we held our own in both cases.
We won one of the games very
close, and we lost one of them
very close. We feel like we be-
long. But for us to reach our goal,
we've got to play two great foot-

ball games.”

Cleveland, of course, is first. '

’/Cleveland is the type of team
that's the toughest to beat,” he
said. ”They’re solid in all areas,

and they don't beat themselves."

Their balance is a concern for us.

”We think we're the best in the
AFC, but'we have to go out and
prove it. If we play one of our
best games, we'll have a chance

to win it. If we play less than that, .

. we'll be watching somebody else
in Pasadena.”

Cleveland corners could pose problems

By Chuck Melvin

AP Sports Writer

VERO BEACH, Fla. —- The
AFC West, home of great cor-
nerbacks, has none better than
Hanford Dixon and Frank
Minnifield of the AFC Central
Division champion Cleveland
Browns, says Denver quarter-
back John Elway.

”We know we're not going
to go in there with anybody
wide open,” said Elway, who
will lead the'AFC West cham-

“ pion Broncos into the confer-
ence championship game in
Cleveland on Sunday. ”We’ll

have to be precise, and I'll

have to put the ball on the
money.”

Elway is accustomed to fac-
ing outstanding cornerbacks,
because the AFC West has two
of the most respected pairs in
the NFL —- Mike Haynes and
Lester Hayes of the Los An-
geles Raiders and Albert Lewis

and Kevin Ross of the Kansas 1

City Chiefs. .

Dixon and Minnifield, he
said, are ”as good as any two
corners we've played all
year.”

Dixon, a.No. 1 draft choice
in 1981, is coming off the best
season of his career. He will
start forthe AFC in the Pro

Bowl, and he was named to
the first team of The Associat-
ed Press All-Pro team.

Minnifield, in his third year
with the Brownsafter playing
16 games in the USFL, was
named a Pro Bowl alternate
despite injuries that slowed
him earlier in the year.

The two play aggressive
bump-and-run coverage
aimed at spoiling the routes
run by opposing receivers.

”We’ve got to take advan-‘
tage when our receivers do
run great routes,” Elway said
in a telephone interview.

Dixon suffered a slight inju-
ry to his left ankle in the

THE Pm NEWS, Friday, January 9, 1987

By David Ginsburg
AP Sports Writer

WASHINGTON — The ability
to adapt, to mold a team to fit the
strengths and abilities of its play-
ers, has helped make Washington
Coach Joe Gibbs the winningest
coach in Redskins history.

Gibbs, who in 1981 became
the 17th coach of the franchise,
has a 71-28 record. No other ac-
tive coach has as good a winning
percentage (.717), and team own-
er Jack Kent Cooke says Gibbs
has the talent to become_ "the
winningest coach in-the history of

the National Football League.”

Gibbs, 46, was selected Coach
of the Year in 1982 and 1983 af-
ter taking Washington to con-
secutive Super Bowls. He
received only one vote for top
honors this season following his
finest job ever.

This was to be a rebuilding year
for the Redskins, who for the first
time since Gibbs’ arrival were
without AlI—Pro running back
John Riggins and quarterback Joe
Theismann. Sixteen current Red-
skins were not on the active
roster at the end of "1985, a 36
percent turnover, but Gibbs
nevertheless directed the team

into the playoffs for the fourth
time in five years.

Sunday, Washington can be-
come the only team in the 19805
to play in three Super Bowls if it
beats the New York Giants in the
NFC Championship game.

"He’s done a great job with
them every year,” claimed Giants
Coach Bill Parcells. "Just look at
the numbers.” '

The squad that Gibbs formed
this season is unlike any team. he
had in the past. With Riggins, the
Redskins were a ground—oriented
team, one that chewed up chunks
of the clock with ba|l—control.

This year, taking advantage of the
strong right arm of quarterback
Jay Schroeder,.Gibbs has trans-
formed Washington into a big-
play team that throws more than
it runs. L
"He's done an ‘incredible job
since I've been here, but this is
probably his best yet,” said Red-
skins linebacker Rich Milot, who
began starting regularly in Gibbs’
initial year with the club. "He
knew this year he had to work
with new personnel and new per-
sonalities, just about a whole new
team. But he has the tremendous
ability to adapt to those people
and get the most out of them.”

his durability to an off-season
. weight program,

"The big thing aboutbeing
in shape and training in the
off-season is you feel good,”
he -said. “You ‘know you've
done what you are supposed
to do. You don't second—guess
yourself and say, 'I should
have done this or that.’ "

Simms also said he’ has
stopped second—guessing him-

self. '’I don’t»go out to practice
worrying about my job," said
Simms, who won the starting
position from Scott Brunner.
"|'ve thrown so many inter-
ceptions, it’s kind of lost its
luster. During the ‘year when
I make mistakes, the coaches -
tell me not to worry. In a way,
you are going to make
mistakes..” -
”The number one thing
about Phil is he will fight you
to the end,” said Coach Bill
Parcells. "He’s always looking
to makéa play. So he will take '
a few more hits than most.”

Giants present biggestchallenge for Gibbs

Gibbs contends that coaching
isn't exactly his idea of a good
time. He doesn't appear to enjoy
the victories much because he is
always worrying about the next
game.

Hours after Washington
stunned the defending champion

Chicago Bears Saturday in the.

NFC semifinals, Gibbs said he
was "tossing and turning” think-
ing of a way to beat the Giants.

‘'1 don't look at coaching as
fun. It's a challenge,” Gibbs said.
"You have so much to do in a
short period of time, I sense ur-
gency more than anything.” I

making
changes
in football

' SAN DIEGO (AP) — Major col-

leges, in a rebuff of the powerful .

Presidents Commission, voted to-

day to reduce from 30 to 25 the .

maximum number of football

. scholarships a school "can give

each year. The total number of
scholarships a school can haveat
one time remains at 95.

The rule takes effect Aug. 1,
I988. '

The proposal was voted on-

despite a request by the univer-
sity presidents that it be with-

-drawn and dealt with as part of

the cost—saving measures to be
addressed at a special convention

— in June.

"We are not in opposition to
what the presidents are trying to

do,” Georgia Tech Athletic

Director Homer Rice said. "We
just believe we have a few
proposals that we are very in-

terested in dealing with at this

time. We'll be glad to help the
presidents in any way possible in
their meeting in June."

in controversy, Showtime is bol-

stering its stable of stars in the

lighter divisions. V

This‘ week, Showtime an-
nounced that it would teleyise a
series of bouts featuring welter-
weight contender Mark Breland,
WBA junior heavyweight cham-
pion Evander Holyfield and other
members of the 1984 U.S. Olym-
pic boxing team.

”Pound for pound, we feel the
best fighters are in the lighter di-
visions," said Allen Sabinson,
Showtime’s senior vice president
for original programming.-
”There’s no question that [WBC
heavyweight champion] Mike Ty-
son is a great fighter, but the rest
of the division is pretty weak.”

Showtime, which started
televising boxing last March, will
Show Breland’s Feb. 6 bout.
against Harold‘ Volbrecht.

Cooper——
Continued from page 11

Cooper. ”I don't have any spe- I
cial reason for being pumped
up for the game,” said Coop-
er. ”It’s a regular game, and I
treat it as such. This is a big
game for us, and we have to
be ready, but I have no per-
sonal incentive except to do
well.”

Cooper epitomizes the team
player. He understands his
role as a reserve, but accepts
it willingly. His work ethic is
outstanding, and he genuine-
Sly wants to help the Panthers

"in any way possible.

I ’’Personally, I 'don't have
any personal goals for the
year. I just want us to win ev-
ery game and to take each
game one at a time. If we do
that, we should win our share
of games.”
