Star Seniors Bow(l )o1u:

 

My fellow students:

“Last0Monda}’» live, the Pitt stu-
dent body, disgraced ourselves in
the_ eyes of the University, our
neighboring. schools and the entire
'community~,by a display of imma-
ture conduct; By doing so we broke
two agreement-s, one with our. uni-
versity administration and one

(PCW)- .

Student Congress _has made an
agreement with the University
deans by which we would use four
hours for football rallies. It‘ was
agreed, that the students would not
attempt to take anymore, nor
would they engage in riotous con-
duct. ‘ _

The agreement has been ob-
served up”unti1 Monday. Then a
group of students, displaying what
they called “school spirit,” but
which can better be deﬁned_as “no
more classes” ‘spirit, took matters

. intotheir own hands.

a  They organized an impromptu

" celebration in .the 'VComn_1cns

some studentleaders, instead of"
trying to stop "the outburst. in-
stigated‘ it.,~Althoug‘h we_ had
used up our four hours," we
would most probably have been-
given an extra hour following a
victory over Penn State. Need-
less to say this is now out of
question.

We have also a no-raiding pact
with the other local schools, as

they do with us. We are ﬁnancially

liable for any damage that our stif-
d_e'nts do. ,

At Chatham our students
damaged, among other things,
some valuable paintings. The
damages will have to be paid
from student activity funds. Of
course all classes at both Tech
and Chatham were disrupted;
This does not enhance our rep-
utation at all.

There are many ways of show-
ing school spirit.‘ School spirit
should not be exercised at the; ex-
pense of others, as we did. We

Disputed Salk Serum

. A University of _Minnesota scientist has come to the
 defense of the Salk vaccine by comparing it with old vaccine

Dr. Leonard Schuman, writing in the Illinois Medical
 Journal, pointed out that failures occur even in inoculations
against smallpox and whooping cough. It is beyond logical

it is so comparatively new, he continued, in effect.

THE TRUE AND TRAGICAL TALE OF J
HAPPY JACK SIGAFOOS I

Who would have thought that Happy Jack Sigafobs, the boy I

the sky never rained, on, would ever teeter on the edge of a life
ofcrime? - 4 A 1
_ Certainly there was no sign of it in his boyhood. His home
life was most tranquil and uplifting. His mother was a nice

, plump lady who hummed a lot and gave baskets to the poor. His

father was a highly respected citizen who could imitate more-
than four hundred. bird calls and once saved an elderly widow.
from drowning in his good suit. (That is, Mr. Sigaf-cos was in

his good suit; the elderly‘ widow was in swimming trunks.)

   
      

    

 Y. '

' . -:—-«'—.=:L:“~. 39*‘? ‘r

Happy J ack’s life was nothing short of idy1lic——until he went
off to college. '  ' ‘

In college Happy Jack quickly became a typical freshman—’ .

tweedy, seedy, and needy. He learned the joys of rounding out

his personality, and he learned the cost. His allowance vanished"

like dew before the morning sun. There were times, it grieves

“me to report, when he didn’t even have enough for a pack of , '

Philip Morris—and you know how miserable that can be! To be

deprived of Philip Morris’s gentle ﬂavor, its subtly blendedh
‘tastiness, its trauma-repairing mildness, its ineffable excellence,

-—why, it is a prospect‘ to break the heart in twain!

Happy Jack tried to get more money from home. He wrote

piteous and impassioned letters pointing out that the modern *5
large-capacity girl simply could not be maintained on his meagre
allowance. But all Jack got from home were tiresome homilies 

about thrift and prudence. I .

Then one day a sinister sophomore came upto Jack and said, 

“I know how you can get more money from home..”. Jack said,»

“How ?” and‘ the sinister sophomore handed him a sheet’ of ..
paper. “For one dollar,” said the sinister sophomore, “I will sell 1-IE‘:
you this list of f iendishly clever lies to tell your father ‘when you

need eitra money.” '

Jack read the list of ﬁendishly clever lies:

1*: A- bunch of us fellows are getting together to buy a new
house for the Dean of Men.

2. A bunch of us fellows are getting together to buy a head-.,‘

stone for Rover, our late, beloved dormitory watchdog.

3. A bunch ofus fellows Eire getting together to buy the college 

a. new fullback. .

4. A -bunch of us fellows are getting together to endow a. chair ‘

of ﬁne arts.

5. A bunch of us fellows are getting together "to b_ui'ld'ou'r own. 

space satellite. '

F or-a moment, poor Jack was tempted; surely his father could__
not but support all these worthy causes. Then J ack’s good up- ~
bringing came to the fore. He turned to the sinister-sophomore. '
and said, “No, thank you. I could not deceive my aged parent so. '_

And as for you, sir, I can only say——.Fie !” \
Upon hearing this, the sinister sophomore broke into a huge
grin. He whipped off/his black hat and pasty face-and who do

377)? think it was? N onelother than Mr. Sigafoos, Happy J ack’s _ ’
‘ father, that’s who! . _ = ‘
passed your test  .;_
brilliantly.” With that he gave Happy Jack a check for a half j ,’ '
1' million dollars and a red convertible containingpfour nubile

“Good 1ad,” cried Mr. Sigafoos. “You have

maidens.
Crime does not pay!

The makers of Philip _Morris, sponsors of this column, could not agree
more. But 'we’ll tell you what does pay—smoking Americ_a’s'gen!le

Administration ,on the other hand, must realize that.

a‘-planned rally program is the best answer for containing
student spirit within the University. And if enthusiasm is

B so great that one hour might prove insufficient, it‘ would
. have been well to extend the period. ‘ Asit was, third hour

classes were held sporadically with constant interruptions.

' Unfortunately, the majority of students are not aware
that four hours has been allotted by University deans for
the purpose of celebration.‘ Were this fact explained at

No. Use Shouting

Wanting and Waiting ,

By lrvkothmon

So you want two slices of cheese in Tuck shop
cheese sandwiches, do you? So you want the city
to block off some of Oakland streets for parking do
you? So you want a swimming pool? Well, so
do I.

But we’re not going to get these demands so
there’s no use shouting for them. They’re un-
reasonable. “They’re far—fetched.;
They’re common demands which;
students raise at schools through 
out the country, and, thus, are
to be ignored. ‘ '

Besides ,we don’t have the
few million bucksfor inﬂuence.
We only have three-cents for a
postage stamp in order to write
city council. Another three-cents
will enable us to send a letter
to the safety director’s ofﬁce.

 

Amusing Answer V
Whether we get satisfactory replies or not, we

will be assured an amusing answer; something for
Omnibus. _

For a while, I thought much of our parking
problem would be solved with the streetcar strike.
Certainly the terrible traﬂic jams would have been
eliminated.‘ But a strike would have given work-
ers time to more quickly complete the Forbes Street
repairs. Special arrangements, I’m sure could have
been made to park autos, two abreast, along street-

Jazz In Iso

-/ By Bill Leslie

Contrary to’ advance publicity '

and billing, those attending the

Modern Jazz ’55 Concert at _Sy- f

ria Mosque, Tuesday night of
last week, did not hear much in
the way of jazz, modern or other-
wise. .It is doubtful is there has
ever been a jazz concert held
locally where less enthusiasm
was displayed, not onlyby. the
musicians but by the audience as
well_.

I must confess to‘ certain fears
concerning the success of this
concert, because more and ‘more
in recent years jazz artists are
becoming dependent on audience
reaction and enthusiasm.

This "is especially true of art-
.ists "who interpret modern jazz,
and a’ half ﬁlled house was hard-
ly a compliment to their crea-
tive ability. To say t t the con-

’ cert went without some indica-

tion of modern improvision would
be an untruth, but highlights
were few and very, very far be-
tween. . ’ ' -

lack in any taste whatsoever.

Used for Judgment

These are the thin s which are
given publicity, and yvhich the
citizenryuse to judge present-
day fraternities and sororities. .

But Pitt’s‘ Interfraternity Coun-
cil last week made _a step in the
right direction. Members have
proposed that fraternities make
attempts‘ to create good will
among University professors.

IF feels. that if faculty mem-

bers be invitedto frat houses for’ '

informal dinners and entertain-
ment, many of theprofs’ miscon-
ceptions of: Greek life will be
erased. At least one fraternity,
Delta Tau Delta, has been prac-
ticing this project for some time,
and reports very favorable re-
sults.

In a Shell j z

This,‘ it is felt, is a splendid
idea, but so much more can be
done. It is impossible to live in a
shell. Throughout our lives we’ve
all got to learn how: to live with
people," and. how to get along
’ with them.

Take a good lookat the loca-
tion of Pitt’s fraternity and sor-
ority houses. ‘Not one of them is
in an isolated area.‘ They are
built in the mids’_c‘of_ many resi-
dential‘ houses. What are these
neighbors’ feelings ‘toward the

remain consistent with this pat-
tern throughout, with but one
exception, and that being a brisk,
lviely thing turned in when

A The_ departure of the Mulligan
Sextet brought forth the Austral-
ian Jazz Quartet who managed
to salvage some note of dignity

for the concert with their highly ,

sensitive and creative artistry. A
group which displayed a wealth
of talent and ‘versatility, their
interpretation of an original Dave
Rose composition, “Nostalgia,”
featuring Jack Brokensha on
vibes, featured modern jazz im-
provision at its best.

My only complaint about this
group was that they didn’t have
an opportunity, to contribute
more to the concert, for after
only four numbers they then ac-
cornpanied'Miss Carmen McRae
through some eight or nine vocal
arrangements. Miss McRae ex-
hibited a ﬁne voice and excel-.4
lent control, ‘. and , rendered a
choice selection of, standards. _

How Communists
Restrict Religion

churches to make sure “preachers
delivered approved texts.”
Nazis Cr.ushed First /

Free‘ speech was ﬁrst crushed in
Czechoslovakia when the Nazis
“Reign of Terror”'in 1939 prohib-
ited people from listening to for-'
eign broadcasting radio stations.

First a black paper was at-
tached to each radio set’s knob’s
to say, “To listen to foreign sta-
tions will be punished with
death,” said Dr.‘ Macek.,This was
a reminder; but didn’t stop ev-
eryone from still listening to
foreign broadcasts.

Then all radio sets were called
into schools where “a skilled me-
chanic eleminated short wave
equipment, so that one could hear
little -more than local stations,” th
instructor explained. I

Book Blanked Out

Under the Communist regime,
portions of books, not conforming
with Marxism, were censored. Dr.
Macek’s ﬁrst book written about
Adam Smith was
blanked out by a publisher who
claimed that comparing Smith to
the. German philosopher of moral
sentiment,
praising the Englishman too much
and degrading the German ‘phi-
losopher.

_These, examples are a few -of
those endured by ;freedom—1oving
people whose opinions are; dis-
couraged by Communistic rule-. For
these people who have been sup-
pressed for nearly seven years,
only fear exists and the -faint
memory of freedom, Macek_ em-
phasized.
