Senator seeks rivalry
for Pitt and Penn State

For Pennsylvanians, Sept. 16, 2000,
marked the end of an era.

Itwas on that day that the Pitt and
Penn State football teams last played
each other.

But despite the Panthers’
12-0 victory, at onceistoried
state football rivalry was lost.

Pennsylvania state Sen.John Wozniak,
D—Cambria, isnowcallinguponPittand
Penn State athletic administrators to re-
kindle the century—old football series.

“I thinkthe timehas comeforboth
schools’ administrators and athletic
directors to spare us the excuses and
get this game back on the schedule,”
Wozniak said in a news release two
weeks ago. “I will offer to facilitate
discussions leading to resuming this
once-great football rivalry.”

SafeRider still priority for SGB

Estelle Tran
Assistant News Editor

Nila Devanath will continue her ﬁght to make
Oakland’s streets safer by tryingto make SafeR-
ider more efficient

At the SGB meeting last night, the.board
member said she’s working with Mary Koch
Ruiz, the coordinator of Pitfs Office of Sexual
Assault Services, to make low—cost upgrades to
the evening—to—early—morning transportation
service.

- The SafeRider system operates with three
shuttles that take students from their desired
pick-up location to their destination, ‘as long as
they’re within a certain boundary.

Devanath said she is trying to acquire sta-
tistics on how many SafeRider calls come from
students who want to get from lower campus to

upper campus.
She said she would like to dedicate one shuttle

to an express route rtmningfrom lower campus
to upper campus — like a 10A shuttle with an
extended route — if it’s cost-effective.

Nicholas Trainer, the governmental relations
chair, reminded students that they can submit
voter registration forms to the SGB office in the
William Pitt Union.

He plansto tirrningthem in on Oct. 5.

The governmental relations committee also
announced that it has begun contacting local
politiciansto attendaforumsothatstudents can
educate themselves on the candidates’ views.

SGB notes:— The Panther Triathlon Club
requested $3,343.96 to attend a race.

Theboard approved the allocations commit-
tee’s recommended amount of $1,910.25.

neering Society $1,140 to attend a conference.

High injury rate prompts project

Musculoskeletal injuries are top cause of military disabilities

prevention. If soldiers are not running,
jumping or otherwise moving improperly,
they are at greater risk for injury. .

In ﬁnding that soldiers were perform-
ing below optimum levels in almost every
area, the laboratory designed an enhanced
training program for the soldiers, better
suited to their tactical needs.

John Abt is the coordinator of the
laboratory’s Eagle Tactical Athlete Program
— originally the “E” stood for “Elite,” but
propriety changed it to “Eagle” for the Fly-
ing Eagles. The soldiers’ standard training
is based somewhat on tradition. Unfor-
tunately, Abt said, it has been based too
heavily on the required semiannual Army
Physical Fitness Training examination.

“’Iheytraintopassthetest, sotheir
training focus isn’t really to meet the tacti-

combat, in deployment,” Abt said. _
Now the laboratory, using its 20 years

of experience with athletes and working

with Army and Navy medical divisions —

‘ and with the help of close to $5 million

in grants from the Department of Defense
—-is trying to change that -

‘‘We’Ve taken the sports medicine
model that has been applied to an athlete
and are now applying it to a tactical ath-
lete,” Abt said.

In a Department of Defense Re-
search Projects newsletter, the laboratory
identiﬁed new areas of focus in training,
including “foot march endurance” and
“explosiveness.”

Abt explained that an important trait
of a soldier is the ability to react — so the
laboratory now has testing and activi-
ties involving jumping and immediately
bounding back up into the air, to jump
backward, to run.

The project arose from need. Re-
ports at the turn of the century from the
Defense Departments Injury Surveillance
and Protection Work Group showed an

Senator: Rivalry good for economy

Rivalry < 1

E.]. Borghetti, aspokesmanforthe Pitt athletics
department, echoed the senator’s desire to resume
the football series — but only conditionally.

“We have repeatedly expressed our desire to
contribute to a series with Penn State,” he said.
“What we do not desire, and would not accept, is
an unbalanced series in terms ofhome games.”

He said that popular football rivalries should
be played annually and rotate home ﬁelds to give
neither team an advantage.

Penn State assistant athletics director Jeff
Nelson said the university would not comment
at this time.

Charles Tocci, a spokesman forwozniak, said
the series originally beganas acontestbetween the
two largest collegiate sports programs inPennsyl—
vania. Through the years, though, the series grew
into a nationally—celebrated event.

“It usedto be on par, and sometimes evenbig—
ger”thanotherfamous national collegiate football
rivalries, said Tocci.

Tocci said that the games created great inter-
estamongfans, garnering sold—out stadiums and
nat1'onally—televised gameday broadcasts.

As a graduate ofPitt atjohnstown and father of
acurrent Penn State student, Wozniak saidthathis
reasons for pushingto resume the football series
are partially personal.

More importantly, he said, the football series
has a large economic impact for Pennsylvania
residents. Rival gamedays used to attract fans

Leon, Nicaragua  

  

nationwide, creatingaweekend—1ongburstinlocal
hotel, restaurant and merchandise sales.

But in his years of pressuring university ad-
ministrators to re—instate the game, Wozniak’s
campaigning has made little progress.

He said that he spoke with both Penn State
President Graham Spanier and Pitt’s Chancellor
Mark Nordenberg aboutthe possibility of resum-
ingthe rivalry. Still, Wozniak urges themto meet
and discuss the games together. _

And if such a meeting can’t happen, Wozniak
said he will encourage Gov. Ed Rendell to become
involved in the issue.

“He’s got the bully pulpit,” said Wozniak.

Pitt alumnus Steve Clappersaid that while he
disagrees with state government interference,
he would like to see the Pitt—Penn State rivalry
continue.

He graduated from Pitt with a bachelor’s de-
gree in mining engineering in 1983 -— the same
year as Pitt football star Dan Marino -— and re-
members the days when Pitt footballwas consis-

tently nationally—ranked. .

Clapper said thatthe in—state rivalry intensiﬁed
football excitement around campus.

“There was a certain electricity in the air,” he
said of Pitt—Penn State gamedays. “Anytime you
get two big schools like that in the same state,
someone is going to want the bragging rights. I
would love to see that rivalry get going again.”

A recent editorial in the Johnstown Tribune
Democrat, Wozniak’s hometown newspaper, criti-
cized the senator for focusing on football rather
thanthe Pennsylvania state budget, whichis more
than two months overdue.

Despite the pendingbudget, Wozniak saidthe
Pitt—Penn State rivalry remains a priority.

“The world doesn’t stop because the'bud—
get doesn’t pass,” he said, adding that would be
“absolutely ludicrous and outlandish” to not
pursue other legislation until the state budget is
approved.

“’I‘hat’s like sayingl can’t even walk and chew
gum at the same time.”

New training proves effective

Training 4 4

Defense Department accepted.
The program is a win-win. The re-
searchers get to apply their work in injury —

- prevention, advancing it beyond the realm

of sports. The military gets faster, stronger
and healthier soldiers. ,

New training programs are well
underway for the U.S. Army 101st at Fort
Campbell, and the testing and injury data-
collecting phase is commencing with the
Naval Special Warfare group TWO in Little
Creek, Va. Both bases sport copies of the
testing facilities in the laboratory’s riverside‘
location in Pittsburgh’s South Side. Health
and ﬁtness testing took 20 months at Fort
Campbell.

Laboratory staff is now training Fort
Campbe1l’s non-commissioned oﬂicers in
the new methods and phﬂosophy devel-
oped out of the testing. The officers will
train the soldiers in their units accordingly.

Abt said that, previously, the training
that soldiers experienced might Vary from
officer to oﬂicer. Each officer in the new
system is akin to a football coach with a
playbook, he said. Now the training will

be more uniform across the division. They 4

are training 30 oﬂicers a week, variable on
unit deployments.
Researchers hope to expand their

program to three other bases in the next -~

14 to 16 months, both Army and Navy. It
all depends on funding.

The results are promising so far. Eagle-
Tactical Athlete Program test groups
showed greater knee and torso strength,
jumping ability, ﬂexibility, balance and
anaerobic running power than control
groups. They performed better in push-
ups, sit—ups and the two-mile run that are
part of soldiers’ biannual physical ﬁtness
test.

Government taking

charge on credit cards

Forget the idea that college
campuses exist in a vacuum
insusceptible to the economic
shortfalls of the outside world.

Jobs for college students
seem scarce, and the economy
sure isn’t making it easier to get

. _ student loans.

But starting in February,
there’ll be a new measure re-
sulting from our poor economy
that’s sure to affect a signiﬁcant
portion of students: The Credit
Card Accountability Responsibil-
ity and Disclosure Act of 2009.

The banks received a hefty
portion of the blame over the

United States’ monetary woes.-

As a result, college students will
now be directly affected by the
all-too-mystifying term, “regu-
lation.” .

T According to a recent Sallie
Mae survey, 84 percent of all
college students have at least
one credit card, while the aver-
age student has 4.6 credit cards.
It’s fair to say that credit cards
are ubiquitous among the college
student population.

Under the federal act, how-
ever, people younger than 21 will
face new obstacles in getting a
credit card.

Students hoping to get a credit

card today face a fairly straight-
forward process: There are a few
forms to ﬁll out and lines to sign.
Sometimes, there’s'even a free
T—shirt for new cardholders, al-
though the act will nix such pro-
motions come February.

Once the act goes into effect,
those younger than 21 will either
need someone older than 21 co-
sign cards or provide proof they
can independently pay off exist-
ing credit card balances.

College students are notorious

for being less—than-responsible.

with their money.

According to the same Sal-
lie Mae survey, college seniors
graduate withan average credit
card debt of more than $4,100,
an increase from about $2,900
in 2004. _

Although this act directly af-
fects students, it’s much more
likely that the careless spending
habits of young people were at
most a tertiary impetus. These
measures are the ﬁrst transpar-
ent effects of increased govern-
ment regulation of banks.

Federal_law will, of course,
enforce the sub-21 age limita-
tion. The banks» will not have the
discretion to say who is or isn’t
monetarily “responsible” enough
to receive a card. This proves the
government doesn’t want to take
chances or.let the banks repeat
mistakes that contributed to the
recession. .

By 21, most people — college
students or not —— have a better
understanding of how finances
work than when they were 18 or
19. This understanding, along
with the safeguard measure re-
quiring an older co—signer, should
absolutely limit the number of
new cardholders that become
swallowed in debt. ,

Perhaps the average college
student has only a shallow under-
standing of the recession and the
economic situation. To some of
the more fortunate, this new act
might provide the first encounter
with the recession’s effects.

Yet it also begs the question:
How will college students feel
about facing the regulation first-
hand?

Keep religion out of health care

Anne Grusheckyl STAFF ILLUSTRATOR

Obama’s use of religious rhetoric in health care debate is an abomination

 
   

Giles Howard
Columnist

President George W. Bush and_his
Republican Party consistently used
religious faith to‘ justify their policy
initiatives during the Bush adminis-
tration’s eight years in office. St:rident—
ly opposed by the Left, Bush injected
religion into every issue — from the

war in Iraq to stem cell research — .

and used faith as a crutch to support
weakly reasoned policies. '

But the American Left that as-
sailed Bush’s religious initiatives
as a violation of the Constitution’s
Establishment Clause has been re-
markably silent now that President
Obama is enlisting religious leaders
in his health care reform assault. A
clear sign of desperation, Obama and
his Democratic allies have attempted

a to use faith to sell health care reform

since June, when Democrats orga-
nized an Interfaith Week of Prayer
on Health Care.

Of course, Obama’s use of religion
in support of public policy has grown
more brazen as the debate has grown

more difﬁcult. In an Aug. 19 speech
before a group of religious leaders,
Obama called his health care reform
plan a “core moral and ethical obliga-
tion” and identiﬁed his opponents in
the health care debate as “hearing
false witness.”

Obama’s language is that of the
most dangerous thief who would take
money from the American worker
and redistribute it to the unproduc-

 

Obamaisspreadinghisbastardized
brand ofpolitics and religion across
the country 

tive in the name of morality. He has
revealed his core ethical obligation to

‘beamassive expansion ofentitlement

spending, contributing trillions of
dollars to this nation’s deﬁcit, and he
justiﬁed the entire program through
the language of religion rather than
reason.

What’s worse is that Obama has
enlisted religious leaders to sell this
thinly veiled theft in a blatant viola-
tion of the intent of our Constitution.
The Founders understood that collu-
sion between religious institutions
and the state was not in the interest
of the citizenry’s liberty.

For this reason, the Founders in-
cluded the Establishment Clause in
the First Amendment, and presidents
and politicians have respected this
division between church and state for
centuries. Indeed, the 13th president,
Millard Fillmore, said, “I am tolerant
of all creeds. Yet if any sect suffered
itselfto be used for political objects I
would meet it by political opposition.
In myview church and state should be
separate, not only in form, but fact.
Religion and politics should not be
mingled.”

But Obama has ignoredthis strong
secular sentiment evident in our na-
t:ion’s history and done exactly what
Fillmore and the Founders warned
future leaders not to do: mingle faith
and politics.

Now Obama is spreadinghis bas-
tardized brand of politics and religion
across the country in a desperate at-

Holding on to records of the past

 
 

Keith Gillogly

Opinions Editor
There are American artists, Brit-
ish artists and female artists. Those
are the categories that separate my
dad’s stock of vinyl records. He has
more than just a few dozen records
haphazardly thrown into some old
boxes. They sit in shelves that span
the entire northern wall of the room,
leaving just enough ‘space for the
windows. Unsurprisingly, we call
this large room on the second ﬂoor
of my house the “music room.” I
count 95 records in one of the 40
shelves. That’s around 3,800 re-
cords total —— and there are more
in the basement, too.

Wherever my dad went, he made
it a habit to check out the local re-
cord shop. Many of the records he
purchased from his hometown shop
in downtown Buffalo, others from
as far away as England, France and
Hong Kong. Sometimes, he had par-
ticular artists in mind. Other times,
he found deals too good to pass. He’s
been buying records perpetually
since his high school days, but the

funny thing is, he doesn’t consider
himself a collector. He’s just a guy
who likes music — a lot. The thou-
sands of records aren’t a collection.
They’re an accumulation.
_ More than once, my mom’s pes-
tered my dad to sell some of his ac-
cumulation, because, for the most
part, the records now sit idly in their
shelves. When I was young, he’d al-
ways be playing the hits and artists
of decades past —-John Lennon,
The Rolling Stones, Buddy Holly,
Kylie Minogue. Everything. It was
a pastime that attuned me to a wide
genre of music, including a range
of oldies and classic rock. At that
age, the two big, booming speakers
brought me as close as I’d come to
a real rock concert. And that was
just ﬁne.
Today, he prefers watching
sports to listening to old records
— perhaps he’s ﬁnally outgrowing
the teenage tendency for blaring
music. So I ask him if he’d really sell
some of his records. He hesitates
just a second before responding.
“Sure.”.
Yet the problem is that my dad’s,
well, too old-school to fumble with

eBay, Craigslist or any other In-
temet-age selling platforms. Sure,
there’s the classiﬁeds section, but
that probably won’t reach as large a
market as online. The task of physi-
cally selling the records would be up
to me. I’m familiar with eBay. The
process would be easy, and I’m sure

_ he’d grant commission —- butl don’t

want to do it.

There’s something lost in the
myriad micro pixels.

He says there are around 500
records he wouldn’t sell —-— his fa-
vorites. For example, he owns ev-
ery Rolling Stones album, and he’d
like to keep it that way. In his day,
vinyl records were ubiquitous, com-
monplace. The thousands of records
seem comparable toia mountain of
old CDs that any kid who grew up

in the ’9os surely has in his closet.
But he keeps his relics neat and or-
ganized.

On my iPod you’ll ﬁnd Pink
Floyd’s Dark Side of the Moon and Bob

I Dylan’s Hzglyuxcyl 6 7 Reo2'i‘itezz'-— two of

my favorites —— and I’ve listened to
both albums using my dad’s record
player. Some audiophiles will argue

_ for the vinyl’s superior, arcane sound
"quality. Yet the music sounds the

same to me. Seeing each of the vinyl
records, holding each of them, that’s
what’s different. They’re products
of a past generation made novel in
the age of downloadable, intangible
music. Both albums are more than
three decadesold. Their corners are
slightly frayed, and the record sleeve
artwork is slightly discolored with
time. I can still read the faded price
tag on the top comer of the Dylan
album: $1.90.

Three orfour years ago my musi-
cal palate expanded to include more
artists from the ’6os and ’70s — the
inevitable emergence of my dad’s
musical inﬂuence. Anytime I found
a new band I liked, I could be sure

mydad had at least one of its albums -

in his library, and often more than

that. I’m still discovering new bands
I like and, with them, old records.

Sure, today iTunes allows you
to download album artwork. But
there’s something lost in the myriad
micro pixels. There’s nothing practi-
cal about an obtuse piece of 12-inch
diameter plastic. There’s nothing
practical about the space required
for storage. Yet, to me, those records
hold a steadfast sentiment in their
originality, an originality that only
grows with time.

Recently, for some reason or an-
other, my iPod would freeze every
time I tried to play David Bowie’s
Zzggy Stardust. It was an armoying
technological glitch, but not one
without solutions.

Zzggy Stardust? Sure, dad has that
album. I watch as he usesa step stool
to access the upper shelves. The re-
cords are all meticulously alphabet-
ized — he ﬁnds it in seconds. He
removes the black disc and hands
me the album cover to look over.
Carefully, he places the needle into

I the vinyl’s groove, and the’ record

begins to play.

Using faith to sell health care

Howard 4 7

tempt to recapture public support
for health care reform. Just last
Wednesday, Organizing for America
sponsored ahealth care rally on Flag-
staff Hill where both a priest and a
congressman enjoined the crowd to
support Obama’s health care goals.
Justas the public use of religion to
justify national policy demonstrated
the intellectual poverty of the Repub-
lican Party during the last decade,
Obama’s attempt to sell Americans

rather than reason should be under-
stood as a sign of weakness.

Indeed, it is aweak politician who
cannot support his policy positions
with facts and reasoned arguments
but instead resorts to statements
of belief and morality. This is just
what the Democratic Left is doing
today by relying on the language of
religion and morality in the health
care debate.

Toward this end, the Democratic

health care is an inalienable human
right that the government has a moral
duty to provide to allAmericans. This
is a great lie designed to separate
hard—working Americans from the
fruits of their production and redis-
tribute it to the unproductive. '

It is a dangerous argument that
suggests that the American people
have a right to the services of doc-
tors and hospital administrators that
trumps the right of these medical

a sign of weakness

proﬁt. It is, plain and simple, an as-
sault on individual liberty.

And it is in this assault on indi-
vidual liberty that the Obama ad-
ministration has found allies in the
nation’s religious leaders. Religion
tells man to love his neighbor as him-
self and to subordinate his interests
to an almighty god, just as Obama’s
statist ideology demands that citizens
assume their neighbor’s burden as
their own and submit their liberty

Both ideologies are incompatible
with the republican foundation of this
country that’s Founders recognized
religion and government as deﬁning
threats to individual liberty. When
government and religion unite, they
are certain to have only one goal: the
subjugation of the individual Ameri-
can citizen.

Conlinne the conversation at Gikfr I2/og,

Exhibit makes no ‘Secret ’ of artist ’s talent

From metalsmithing to magic—making: Cooney ’s artwork brings children’s stories to life in new exhibit

Samantha Stahl
Staﬁ‘ Writer

“The Secret Lives of Stories”
Artist: Jen Cooney

707 Penn Gallery

Sept. 4 through Oct. 17

At the opening reception of her
new exhibition, “The Secret Lives
of Stories,”Jen Cooney attracted as
many gazes as her art.

She wore a white fur mini skirt,
vest and hood. Her makeup, done
by a drag queen friend of hers, was
turquoise, spectacular and topped
off with some of the biggest faux
eyelashes in history.

“I try to be creative in every-
thing. Every part of life,” Cooney

said.

Cleary, she does.

Cooney’s interest in art and all
things creative started at an early
age. '

“Ever since I was a child, I liked
art. My mom’s really creative. I
just always loved to draw as a kid.
I would draw little pictures for my
friends. They’d be like, ‘Draw me
a cat!’ And I’d be like, ‘Okay!”’ she
said.

She doodled her way through
high school before going on to Ed-
inboro University to study metal-
smithing.

“I think I have ADD, but I was
never diagnosed. I always had a hard

time paying attention in school. So I --

would draw tons — there was prob-
ably more drawings than notes in

 

Artist: Jen Cooney
_ “The Lighting Spirit”
e009

my notebooks,” she said.

Cooney graduated from Edin-
boro with the metalsmithing degree

’ but no longer works in the ﬁeld.

“I just wanted to do art, and I
changed my mind a million times.

I just wanted to be expressing my-
sel ,” she said.

When she spoke about art,
Cooney’s passion was evident.

“It’s not even a career, it’s my
life. I just need to do art. I make
it all the time. If I couldn’t make
art ...” Her voice paused and her
gaze wandered, perhaps picturing
a sad, colorless life without art.
The break lasted only a moment,
though, for Cooney’s real world is
far more fun.

“The Secret Lives of Stories” is
a surreal, colorﬁil and character-
ﬁlled experience. Stepping inside
the 707 Penn Gallery is like step-
ping onto the page of a children’s
book —— coincidentally, Cooney is
thinking about going to graduate
school for illustration since people

frequently tell her to go into the

. children’s story business.

Two walls are covered with tiny
ink drawings depicting people and
animals. Another area displays a
cluster of pictures connectedby
a weaving rainbow painted right
onto the wall. Her most magniﬁcent
pieces, though, are larger colored
works crammed full of detail.

But Cooney didn’t stop on the
page. She extended the scenery and
characters to the walls. Bats ﬂy off
the page and toward the ceiling.
Trees grow beyond the canvas, and

tiny mushroom people high-ﬁve in

front of a hollow.

“My work kind of illustrates an-
other world. If you look at them, it’s
almost like you’re looking through
little windows on stories,” Cooney

Like atypical work day, ‘Extract’ is just mediocre

Andy Tybout
Staﬁ Writer

(S ct9!

Starring: Jason Bateman, Ben '
Afﬂeck, Mila Kunis

Directed  Mikejudge
Miramax Films

B-

If a comedy makes you laugh,
does the plot even matter?‘

This is the central question of
“Extract,” MikeJudge’s (“King of the
Hill,” “Ofﬁce Space”) latest romp,
and depending which side you take,
you might ﬁnd this movie either a
comedic triumph or a meandering
failure.

“Extract,”Judge’s latest ﬁlm after
2o06’s anti-intellectualism satire
“Idiocracy,” features an original, if
puzzling, premise:]oel (Jason Bate-
man of “Arrested Development”)
runs into trouble when a worker in
his extract factory suffers an up-
roariously graphic accident (which
I won’t mention here). ’

]oel’s problems are exacerbated

when the worker decides to sue for a
large sum of money at the urging of a
mysterious and hot co-worker (Mila
Kunis). The co-worker, of course, is a
con girl, and she’s lookingto reap the
monetary beneﬁts of the worker’s
lawsuit while simultaneously seduc-
ingjoel, the boss (though why she
wants to do the latter is never quite
clear).

Other problems inJoel’s life, like
his lack of marital excitement and
the ideas of his invariably misguid-
ed friend (played by a bearded Ben
Aflleck), accelerate his inevitable
decline.

“Extract” follows in the ac-
claimed director’s tradition of try-
ing to engender hilarity by hurling
absurd amounts of 'sh*t into that
proverbial fan — in this ﬁlm, as in
his others, events transpire primar-
ilyto devastate the main character.
But in “Extract,” the fall from grace
is less gracefully accomplished -
rather than plunging full on into a
comedic hell, Joel seems to suffer a
slow, laborious decline.

The movie goes up when it should

Freudian fashion follies

Stahl: Don’t be “psyched” out by newest fall trends

Sam Stahl
Staﬂ’ Writer

What would Freud look like in a nice pair of
leggings? I shudder to think, but recently, I
have been making more and more connec-
tions between fashion and psychology.
Despite my inability to understand any-
thing math- or science—related, I’m a psy-
chology major. Forgetting that Pitt, home
to one of the preeminent medical schools

3 in the country, can turn just about anything
 into a science (I swear even my creative writ-
.  ing classes are methodical), I signed up for

psych.

I thought I’d spend four years sitting in
leather chairs and analyzing people’s per-
sonalities. Turns out you don’t really do
this at all. Instead, I’ve spent the last three
years repeatedly learning the same things:
habituation, Freud’s creepy phallic obses-
sions, neurological pathways and that whole
nature vs. nurture thing.

Today in Sam’s Psychology of Fashion

5 101, we’re going to discuss habituation.
 In case you’re one of the lucky few who’s

managed to escape the
conﬁnements of Intro
to Psych, allow me to
deﬁne: Upon repeated
exposure to any given
Stimulus, the human
body gradually stops
responding to it. Es-
sentially, you’re capable
of getting used to any-
thing you spend too
much time around.
This explains why a

world.

There is a total perception
disconnect between the
fashion and non-fashion

tracts strange looks. _

In the true nature of a psychology stu-
dent, I decided to do a little experiment.
I composed a list of quirky clothes that I
think are absolutely extraordinary and set
out to see if a non-fashion lover would have
the same opinion.

I needed someone far removed from the
fashion world, someone with an untrained
eye completely unexposed to the idiosyncra-
sies of the industry. So I called my brother.
Despite my constant nagging to update his
wardrobe, he generally sticks to polo shirts,

cargoshorts and college T—shirts. Exactly _

the perspective I needed.

We started off with a_ look at a piece from
Ba1main’s Fall 2009 collection — a yvide-
shouldered blazer and black pants with
metallic embellishments. 1 _

“If I walked downstairs in this, what
would you say to me?” I asked.

“Uh, are you going to a disco ball dance?”
he replied.

So we moved onto a denim jumpsuit from
Madewell. .

“It looks like you just got out of solitary
conﬁnement.”

Would a shorter denim romper get a bet-

ter reaction?
“Well, it saves you

the effort of buying .

two separate pieces of
clothes.” Guess not.

What about a pair of
harem pants?

“It makes the wear-
er look like a horse.”

I figured those
would get that reac-
tion. So I showed him a

boy’s bedroom always

smells like stale beer, and they don’t seem
to notice, and how we manage to sleep in
Oakland despite the constant cacophony
of helicopters and ambulances outside at
all hours of the night.

I think habituation goes far beyond daily
smells and sounds, though. It works for our
cultural experiences as well. For example,
people who live and breathe fashion habitu-
ate to runway trends. The more magazines
and fashion shows they see, the more their
standard for normality is altered. Suddenly,

neon leggings and a sequined blazer seem V

like a perfectly acceptable outﬁt for the most
mundane of daily events — like jury duty.
To the rest of the world, these clothes
seem utterly ridiculous. But to the fashion
set, they are beautiful. There is a total per-
ception disconnect between the fashion
and non-fashion world. In major cities, the
spheres collide a little bit. In smaller towns,
however, wearing something not generally
seen in the window of American Eagle at-

picture of a really sweet
military style jacket.

“Whaddup, G.I. Jane?” I tried not to be
offended.

Distressed, boyfriend style jeans?

“Yeah, I like to buy ruined clothes, too.”
I felt like someone was insulting my ﬁrst—
born child. .

I sadly whimpered, “So really, all this
stuff is a no-go?”

To which he answered, “I guess being
fashionable takes dedication. Aside from
the jeans and the cool disco pants, this is
all too extreme.”

So there you have it. Exhibit A: that fash-
ion-lovers habituate, truly believing clothes
——_ that to the rest of the world seem like a
freak-fest — are totally cool. 1

Tomorrow marks the ﬁrst day of New
York Fashion Week. A whole new season of
ridiculous trends will debut. Some will have
mass appeal, others will not. If you spot me
running around Oakland in some atrocious
get-up, I apologize in advance. I can’t help
what I like —— blame psychology.

. How does she come up with these fan-
tastical people and places? “A lot of times if
someone’s in my life a lot or if they’re really
close to me, they’re in the pieces as people,

Cooney said.

When asked how she gets from blank can-

disappointed. I’ll have one little idea, like, ‘I
want to draw a dolphin.’ And then I’ll just take
it from there and work for hours and get it
done,” she said.

said that it can come from anything.

Extract 4 9

,4 go down and stands still when it should plunge
ahead. This muddled pace — a byproduct of
poor writing —— is what keeps the ﬁlm from
being the delightﬁilly crafted descent into
mundane yet maddening hilarity that was
“Office Space.”

But here’s the rub: The movie is often ﬁmny.

‘9“ Not as funny as “Office Space” or “Idiocracy,”
but ticldish enough to please almost any audi-
ence. There are scenes —— particularly aweed-
smoking session — that build perfectly into
a climax of hilarity. And fans can rest assured

that]udge’s impeccable eye for armoying char-
acters is still as sharp as ever —— the nagging
neighbor (David Koechner) and the moronic
male gigolo (Dustin Milligan) are perhaps some
of the movie’s biggeststrengths.

But the plot is vague. The motivations are
vague. Even the movie’s trailer is vague (watch
it), which should say something about the mov-
ie. Only once, whenjudge makes a half-hearted
attempt at interjectingablue- collar vs. white-
collar conﬂict into some of the scenes, does the
movie ever approach social satire. A

\

But even this potentially ripe dynamic gets

' lost, like all the other jokes, in the muddle of

a plot that seems more convoluted than zany.
Rather than rallying the. comedy‘ around a
concrete idea (corporate malaise, for instance,
or American stupidity), Judge uses an extract
factory as an excuse for jokes.

There’s still enjoyment to be found in “Ex-
tract,” butJudge’s undiminished humor can’t
compete with his diminished sense of plot. So,
to answer the original question, does the plot
matter in a comedy‘? if

Despite lack of plot, comedy still amusing

Yes, it does. Like lyrics in a captivating song,
the plot gives the comedy purpose and, often
times, adds a new dimension to the humor.
Judge chose instead to make “Extract” a font
in which to pour all his stray jokes, plot be
danmed. ‘

If tl1at’s okay with you — if you’re not both-
ered by 91 minutes of “Family Guy”—style hu-
mor — then you’ll probably get a kick out of
this movie.

‘ If not, then you can always just rent “Office
Space” on Netﬂix. .

Habbelclosing in on multiple school records

The senior is‘ tied for most goals in Pitt history and is just five’ points away from the most points ever scored by a Panther

Lauren Kirschman
Senior Staﬁ Writer

With a one-timer from roughly ﬁve
yards out, Ashley Habbel scored
a rare goal — as well as Pitt’s only
goal — in a 1-0 women’s soccer win
against Kent State last week.

It’s not unusual for Habbel to
score or win a game for Pitt soccer,
but the goal was her 18th as a Pan-
ther, tying her for most in school his-
tory. It’s something she never could
have predicted when she arrived at
the University four years ago.

“As a freshman, I was very tenta-
tive and not very conﬁdent,” Hab-
bel said. “As I got more experience
on the ﬁeld and got older, my con-
ﬁdence grew. I will be ecstatic if I
break the record. I think it’s a great
way to leave my mark here.”

With 14 games remaining —-
practically a complete season —— it
seems inevitable that Habbel will net
her record—breaking 19th career goal
sometime this year. .

Her next chance to break the
scoring record is on Friday when
Pitt takes the ﬁeld against Drexel.
Habbel is currently tied with Cande
Ruiz for the career goals record. Ruiz

played at Pitt from 1998-2001 and
also holds the career points record
with 47. Habbel can surpass that
mark by adding six more points to
her current total of 42. A goal counts
for two points, and an assist is one.

“I try not to think about it too
much because I don’t want to dwell.
Soccer is a team sport, but it means a
lot. The records haven’t been broken
in nine years,” Habbel said.

Habbel’s scoring ability is crucial
to the team’s success and Pitt head
coach Sue-Moy Chin said she has a
giftfor scoring garne—winning goals,
including her goal against Kent State
to tie the record. Habbel has accu-
mulated nine game-winning goals
so far in her career.

“Breaking the record was deﬁ-
nitely one of her goals coming in
to this season,” Chin said. “The

V fact that she is so close now is just
a testament to her work rate, both a

in season and out of season. She’s
good with possession. She’s been
able to hold the ball for us, which
hasn’t always been easy.”

Along with her physical skills,
Chin said Habbel’s leadership is
one of the most important assets
she brings to the team. Habbel rec-
ognizeshow to be successﬁil on and

Ashley Cuba has a knack for it.

When she gets into the attack-

‘natural. She has a nose for threading

- the ball into the net.

“She’s dangerous,” Pitt women’s

“You can’t teach that kind of ﬁnish-

that she has. That stuff was innate
with her. She’s coming in, providing
a spark for us.”

 Cuba, a freshman midﬁelder, is
only four games into her collegiate
soccer career, but she’s already

backing up Chin’s words. Cuba’s
line through her ﬁrst four contests:
four goals and an assist. Her nine
points lead Pitt and put her in a tie
for second in the Big East. She trails
only Villanova’s Katie Ryan, who has
10 points but has played one more
game. She’s also tied for ﬁrst in the
conference in goals, goals per game
(one), points per game (2.25) and
game—winning goals (three).

"But perhaps the most important
stat is that she and the Panthers have
tallied four wins, leading to theirﬁrst
national ranking in school history
this week, with a No. 25 ranking by
Soccer America.

Perhaps it’s no coincidence. In

_ Cuba, the Panthers have a 2009

high school all-American as named
by ESPN. They also have a scoring
punch off the bench — Cuba is leading
the team in points without starting
a game.

Cuba, who is from Poland, Ohio,

Ashley Cuba

knows her performance early in the
year has been impressive and carries
herself with a certain conﬁdence.

“I want to be on some sort of Big

East team,” Cuba said. “I don’t care )

if it’s second, third. I want to get my
name out there, and I want to be
breaking records.”

That conﬁdence, though, couples
with a modesty that is quick to laud
her teammates.

“It wasn’t just me on those goals,”
Cuba said. “I have to give credit to
Laura Berbert and Liz Carroll forthat
second goal» in the Ohio State game
because without them it would have
never happened, because it was just
a deﬂection.”

It was lastjanuary that Cuba ﬁrst

came to Pitt. She graduated early
from high school and enrolled to get

a head start with the team. Both Chin A

and Cuba believe thatwas an essential
period in adjusting to a higher level of
competition and learning the things
expected of a Division I player.

And Cuba still has much to learn.
According to Chin, Cuba needs to im-
prove on holding possession, passing
and contributing on defense.

“She’s not the most talented
player on the ﬁeld, [but] she’s a fairly
quick learner,” Chin said. “She wants
to win and do whatever it takes to
win.”

But Cuba says she expects a lot
of herself. She’s ﬁilﬁlling her dream
of playing for a major program in a

Duquesne comes back to beat Pitt

After starting 5-1, the Panthers have lost their last two matches

Jen Zettl I STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER

Michelle Rossi and the Panthers have lost their last two matches against the Dukes.

Greg Trietley
Staff Writer

Pitt women’s volleyball team lost to cross-

city rival Duquesne Tuesday night 3-2, drop— ,

ping to 5-3 on the season. .

Tied 2-2, Duquesne took the ﬁnal set
15-9.

The loss marks the second consecutive
year that Duquesne has defeated the Pan-
thers. «

The Dukes also upset Pitt last year at the
Fitzgerald Field House, but the Panthers
hold a 38-3 series lead.

Chelsea Tillotson led Duquesne to the
win with a double-double, tallying 42 assists
and 10 digs. Allyson Hodnik had 40 assists
for the Panthers.

Meagan Dooley topped all Pitt players
with 19 kills.

Pitt started the evening by dominating

Duquesne 25-9 in the ﬁrst set, but the Dukes

won the next two sets 25-16 and 25-23.

The Panthers won the fourth set 25-20
in a showdown that featured seven lead
changes before falling in the ﬁfth.

With the loss, the Panthers’ record drops
below those of Big East schools Villanova and
West Virginia, both 5-2. South Florida (5-0)
and Marquette (6-1) remain the top teams in
the conference so far this season.

Duquesne, meanwhile, improves to 7-1
on the year. The Dukes start in-conference
play Sept. 25 at Fordham.

Suddenly on a two-game losing streak
after starting the season 5-1, the Panthers
head to Albuquerque this weekend to face
Baylor, Cal State Fullerton and New Mexico
in the New Mexico Tournament.

After that, the Panthers return home
to host the Blue and Gold Tournament. On
Sept. 19, Pitt plays Valparaiso, then ‘Middle
Eastern Shore and Youngstown State the
following day.

September 9, 2009 I The Pitt News l.wwW.pittneWs.e0m

Fans should be allowed to boomediocre play

Shane Levy
Staff Writer

 

Over the weekend, the Pittfootball team opened
its 2009 season in impressive style with an
overwhelming victory over the Youngstown
State Penguins 38-3. Surely, a victory of that
magnitude should help ease any concern or
skepticism that Pitt students and fans might
have about the 2009 season.

Coming into this college football season, I
was very skeptical about the potential success
of the Panthers, given the departures of several
signiﬁcant players — like LeSean McCoy and
Scott McKil1op. However, the Panthers play
on the ﬁeld Saturday afternoon quickly made
me rethink my predisposed notions about this
year’s squad. The dynamic play of freshman
running back Dion Lewis almost made me
forget about last year’s star running back, and
the Pitt defense wreaked havoc on the clearly
overmatched Penguins. Even backup quarter-

back Tino Sunseri looked impressive in his brief
outing this past weekend.

On Sunday, however, the impressive and, for
many Pitt fans, reassuring, play of the Panthers
was overshadowed by a gesture directed at
notoriously inconsistent quarterback Bill Stull.
The Heinz Field crowd booed Stull loudly on the
second drive of the game after consecutive in-
complete passes, and later again inthe 3rd quar-
ter. Even more, when Sunseri entered the game,
he got a cheer so loud onemight have thought he
was Dan Marino, or that someone accidentally

played “Sweet Caroline” too early. 1

On Post- Gazette ~ sports columnist Bob
Smizik’s blog on Sunday, Smizik took serious
offense to the crowd’s derision of Stull, calling
it both “ugly and mean-spirited.” Smizik’s col-
league at the Post- Gazette, Ron Cook, described
the boos as simply pathetic. Cook’s sentiments
were reiterated by Tribune-Review columnist
Joe Starkey, who went so far as to say that the
booing “is pathetic and needs to stop.”

Perhaps after my four years as a Pitt student, .

Iamstill not acclimated enough with the sports
culture in the Pittsburgh region to understand
these sentiments. But to cast outrage over an
incident as common and insigniﬁcant as fans
booing poor performance on theﬁeld of play
is itselfan outrage.

Growing up in the shadows of New York
City, I was, and am struggling to continue, to
cheer heartily for the New York Knicks, Jets
and Mets. It does not take an avid sports fan
to know that those franchises have not had
the same levels of success as the Penguins or
Steelers. Seventeen consecutive losing sea-
sons is one feat the Mets have yet to conquer,
though. ,

Enduring such painful hardship on the
football ﬁeld, basketball court and baseball
diamond breeds fans to rain boos on athletes
at virtually every moment of every game.
The Mets collapsing two out of the last three

years in September only to watch the hated:

Philadelphia Phillies go on and win the World
Series, Doug Brien missing two potential game-
winningﬁeld goals to send thejets to the 2004
AFC Championship Game, the entire operation
of the Knicks franchise — all of these things
have virtually embedded the art of booing in
my DNA. ‘

Let us not forgot recent Pitt football history,
either. The 2008 Pitt football season was met
by high expectations and resulted in less-than-
stellar results, capped offby the disastrous Sun
Bowl inwhich the Panthers lost to Oregon State
3-0 -— a loss that can be attributed to Stull’s
disastrously poor play, among other things.

This year, much like many of the recent
seasons in Pitt football, is one marked by high
expectations. In a down year for the Big East,
Pitt has enough talent to ﬁnally take the confer-
ence crown, whichwouldbe its ﬁrst since 2004.
The combination of high expectations and
Stull’s inconsistent and sometimes costly play
was merely a powderkeg that ﬁnally burst.

Over the course of Dave Wannstedt’s tenure
as head coach of the Pitt football team, he has
consistently produced top—25 recruiting class-
es. Year after year, the Pitt football program
is replenished with new and exciting young
talent. Yet year after year, the Panther faithful
have been let down by poor results. _

The mounted frustration and let downs of
past seasons needed to be heard. It is unfortu-
nate that Stull bore the beating of the Panther
faithful, but it was not uncalled for. The Pan-
ther fans were not wrong in booing Stull. The
gesture might have been a bit premature but
far from unjustiﬁed.

With record looming, Habbel wants to help teammates win BigEast

The sem'or’s main goal heading into the season was to help the Panthers advance in the Big East tournament and get to the NCAA Tournament

off the ﬁeld, Chin said, and her teammates
respect and follow her.

“She understands the ‘big picture,” Chin
said. “Her desire to win is very good and she
understands the work it takes in order to be
successful.” _

Habbel, an applied developmental psychol-
ogy major, said it was especially important
for her to take on a leadership role duringgher

senior season because she is one of the most ‘

experienced girls on the team. .

“It’s our job. to help [younger teammates
through things and to be there for them,”
Habbel said. “It’s very important, because I
can remember my seniors, and we had some
very good leaders.”

That leadership helped Habbel develop
into an accomplished forward — but as a
freshman, Habbel said she had no visions of

major conference., even without tons of schol-
arship offers coming out of high school: Pitt
was the only major program to extendan offer
to Cuba. She mostly garnered attention from
smaller D—1 schools like Bowling Green and
Ohio University. .

It hasn’t been something she has thought
about. Cuba carries no chip on her shoulder
and feels like she has nothing to prove. Rather,
she plans to simply focus on setting goals and

achieving them —— individually and for her I

team.

_ “I like where I’m at,” Cuba said. “I always
‘expect a lot of myself. I want to win the Big
East tournament.”

Luckily for Cuba," this year the Panthers
might have a better shot at that than ever.
For only the second time in program history,
the team started the year 4-0. No team in Pitt
historyhas ever started 5-0, asthe 2006 team
tied itsﬁlth game and lost the sixth. The 2006
team also made the Big Easttoumament, but it
lostinthe ﬁrst round to Louisville. This year’s
squad gets its chance to go 5-0 Friday when
it plays at Drexel.

Regardless if the Panthers win their next

. game, both Chin and Cuba feel good about the
team and where they are headed. And after
her hot start in collegiate athletics, Cuba isn’t
the only one wondering if she can make an
All-Big East team or break records over the
course of her career.

“If she continues on this pace, absolutely,”
Chin said.

potentially breaking school records. All she
wanted to do was play soccer.

“Thatwas all I was worried about, just get-
ting on the ﬁeld,” Habbel said. “That was my
main goal. Then, as I started playing more,
I wanted to contribute more to us winning,
whether that was scoring goals or just play-
ing more. As a freshman, I never would’ve
guessed it.” A

Despite her personal success, Habbel de-

scribed her biggest strengths — her will to
win and her competitiveness — with a focus
on how they help her team win.

“That in itselfhas made me do everything
I can in order to score,” Habbel said. “If we
score, we  I  those are the most im-
portant things.”

She said she didn’t come into the season
wanting to accumulate a certain number of
goals or assists, but she wanted to be a leader

and help the team achieve its collective aim in
any way possible. Pitt’s 4-0 start is tied withthe
2006 team for best in school history.

“The team goals are to do very well in the
Big Easttournament and make it to the second ' 3
round at least,” Habbel said. “That’s the mini-
mum for us, because we feel we can deﬁnitely
go far into the Big East tournament this year.
Then, we deﬁnitely want to get an NCAA bid
and make it to the NCAA Tournament.”
