News Assistant

Madeleine Blais, a Pulitzer
Prize-winning journalist, spoke-
last night about her current
projects at a lecture sponsored
by Pitt's English Department.

Blais, who is an associate
profess_or in journalism at the
University of Massachusetts, is

_now working on “In These
Girls Hope is a Muscle,” an arti-
cle which will appear later this
year in Atlantic Mont/9/y. ,

Last night Blais read parts of
“Hope,” which tells the stoiyof
the friendship, struggles and
rivalries between two girls on a
Massachusetts high school bas-
ketball team. “It’s not a book
about basketball per se,” Blais
said. “A lot of the"stoi"y is told
from the emotional langlel.”

Blais spent time with the
Amherst High School wo1nen’s
basketball team during much
of their 1992 season, traveling
with the team and getting to
know two of the team’s top
players.

' According to Blais, spending
such a great deal of time with
people and noticing their sur-
roundings, possessions and
habits often allows 1‘epOl‘t€I‘S to
see people as they really are.

“When you interview people
in a sterile situation, all you do
is get their talk,” Blais said.

Pulitzer Prize author relays experiences

 will face metal detectors

By Sam Gresock

News Assistant

In an effort to ensure that students will
have both a fun and safe time, metal detec-
tors will be used at a social event this
Saturday in the William Pitt Union.

According to WPU graduate assistant,
manager Robert Delie, the detectors will
be used at the Delta Sigma Theta social
Saturday evening to check for weapons.

Delie said a group of organizations that
use the union for social events decided on
the metal detector policy when they met
earlier this semester to discuss regulations

Finartcial solutions available for apartment

for socials in WPU. .
“It was a concern of organizations that
use our space for socials,” Delie said. “They

' were concerned that the safety of college

students isn’t being jeopardized.”

Delie said the use of the detectors is not
the result of any past incidents, but is pri-
marily going to be used as a safety precau-
tion. ,

“We haven’t had any serious problems
with guns in the building in the past,” Delie
said. “[Use of detectors] is primarily a deter-
rent, to get the idea across that guns aren’t
welcome. . V A

Pulitzer Prize winning author Madeleine Blais speaks on the art of writing.
“The objects people surround
themselves with often [explain]
their inner life  they show
what a person is really like.”

Blais said while working on
in—depth features and spending
time with many people, she
often has to deal with private
issues in their lives.

She said it is important N to
strike a balance between
choosing an angle which

in the end you have to live

want to narrow the gap
[between ethics and interesting

to speak on their level with

bugs out,” he added.

According to Delie, organizations which
use union space for socials are responsible
for hiring two police officers for security.
Delie said the officers, which usually patrol
the front of the social area, may be reas-
signed to operate the detectors.

Delie also called the use of the detectors a
good idea.

“I think it’s a good thing  our building
management has to work closely with the
organizations to make sure things run well,”
he said.

“We want to make sure things don’t hap-
pen that shouldn’t happen.”

(Editors note: 77915 is the last
of a three-part series on apart-
ment-bzmttng in Oakland.)

The race for an apartment
does not end when the contes-
tants stake their territories.
Rather, the efforts continue as
the bills start rolling into the
new address.

“When I started living by
myself, that’s when I became a
little shocked over [the costs], to
say the least,” said senior

Michael Hedrick, who lives in
an efficiency in South Oakland.
“On top of having a higher rent
to begin with, the bills can’t be
cut in half, like when you live
with another person.”

Paying for an apartment can
sometimes be harder than find-
ing one, as many students who
rent soon discover. When pay-
ing for rent becomes a problem,
tenants have several available
options, legal rights and limita-
tions.

First, Student Government
Board legal advisor Mark

Galzerano said, a lawyer cannot
get tenants out of leases.
Tenants who decide to “walk”
may become the target of a civil
suit, said Galzerano. And, if the
landlord is not paid in time, the
tenant can be evicted.
According to the state’s
Landlord-Tenant Act, there are
only three circumstances that
permit a landlord to evict a ten-
ant. First, a tenant may be evict-
ed if he or she has not moved
out by the end of the lease.
Second, eviction can occur if
the tenant has broken some

clause in the lease.

Finally, if a tenant is behind in
the rent, the landlord can con-
sider eviction. However, the law
requires that before locking out
or evicting a tenant, the land-
lord must go through court pro-
cedures and must give the ten-
ant written notice.

Upon receiving a court notice

for an eviction hearing, the law

says the renter should contact a
lawyer or tenant organization. If
the tenant does not show up at
the hearing, the landlord auto-
matically wins the case and

surgeon
leaves
Pitt for
Miami

By Matt Groff
Asst. News Editor

For the second time in a
month, a prominent mem-
ber of the University of
Pittsburgh Medical Center
has left Pittsburgh for a
position with another uni-
versity.

"Dr. Andreas G. Tzakis,
director of pediatric trans-
plantation, announced
that he will be leaving Pitt
after 11 years as part of
the transplant team who

which have gained
national and international
lauennon.

According to the
Pittsbu rg/9 Post- Gazette,
he will become co—direc-
tor of the transplant pro-
gram at Jackson Memorial
Hospital in Florida which
is affiliated with the
University of Miami. He
will also head the liver
and gastrointestinal trans-
plant program at the hos-
pital. '

At Pitt, Tzakis worked
on such projects as the
multiple—organ transplants
of Laurie Davies and
Charlie Fourstar. He told
the Post-Gazette he wish-
es to continue his work in
cross-species transplants
such as the baboon liver
transplants.

“We have to find alter-
natives Ito human-to-
humanl transplants,” he
said. He also said it was

Sophomore Chad Devinney
said although he found an
apartment with little difficulty,
paying for the bills and rent is
still a big concern. ‘The
Financial Aid Office will give
you loans for on—campus [hous-
ingl,” said Devinney, “but they
don’t give you anything for off-
campus.”

BiGALA
begins
elections
process

By Jennifer McGinnis
Staff Writer

Nominations for next year’s
officers were the focus of
the Bisexual, Gay and Les-
bian Alliance’s meeting’ yester-
day.

Though nominations were
taken last night, the group
will continue to accept
them until 5 pm. on April 19,
for the April 20 election, said
BiGAI.A co-President Sacha
Layos. I

In other news, BiGALA plans
to distribute several hundred
newsletters and fact sheets
about bisexuals, gays and les-
bians around campus and in
local coffee houses. _

The literature was meant to
be a part of last week’s
Bisexual, Gay and Lesbian
Awareness Days, but instead
will be distributed this week
due to problems in printing.

BiGALA members also dis-
cussed forming a tie with the
newly established BiGALA
group at Pitt’s Bradford campus.
Plans to take a group of stu-
dents to the Bradford campus to
visit and support the new group
are underway.

BIGALA will be sponsoring a
“Coming Out Workshop” April
6. “The workshop would be
good for someone who’s not
comfortable enough to go to a
regular meeting, but wants

someone to talk to,” Layos said. .

BIGALA will wrap up the year
with a picnic on Saturday, April
23, from noon to 3 13.111.

Last night’s meeting also
included a guest speaker. from
a local support group for
the close friends and significant
others of » people with
AIDS. The group branched
off from an umbrella group
called the Shepherd Wellness

See BiGALA, page 4

In the last column, I
suggested that making signifi-
cant changes in your lives can
be impeded by low self-
esteem.

One suggestion for chang-
ing your negative self

’ view was to become more
observant of people who
seem to have healthy
self—esteem and, where possi-
ble, to emulate these individ-
uals.

Another way to build self-
esteem is to become physical-
ly O and psychologically
tougher. Some relatively
new research informs us that
the best way to learn to han-
dle the stressors in our life
is not by learning how to
relax more, but by getting
tough.

The findings suggest that
people who toughen them-
selves physically and emo-
tionally change their body
chemistry in ways that help
them combat the negative
‘effects of stress.

I suspect that this is also
true for self-esteem. The
tougher you are, the more
you are able to face up to

the demands of the world and
the better you feel about
yourself.

One way to get tough is
to take risks, i.e., to push
yourself in all kinds of ways.
You.can push yourself physi-
cally, for example, by starting

you or recognizing some
of the angry, fearful or lov-

and sharing them with some-

It’s even possible to
strengthen yourself by taking
intellectual risks. Read books

' that challenge you to think in

different ways.

Take courses that stretch
you. Read more about
politics, religion or sports
and form some personal
opinions about these sub-
jects.

These initiatives will help
you to express
more confidently to other
people.

Many of us avoid these risks
because we fear failure. We
need to learn, however, to
accept the fear rather than run
from it.

Without fear or the possibil-
ity of failure. there is no risk; if
there is no risk, there is little
opportunity to grow.

People with high self-
esteem take risks frequently.

she said. “When you come to
interview them you’re not sure
whether you’re going to get
them [acting] 12 years old or 22
years old.”

According to Blais, good fea-
ture writing requires much more
in-depth research than does
news writing, a fact which she
said gives writers a broader
base of knowledge.

“I think in news writing 
you write everything you know
and then some,” she said. “In
feature writing, even if it's a
really great story, you have to
shape things more and structure
it more and you're better off
knowing 10 to 100 times more
than you actually use."

Blais, who received her
Bachelor of Arts degree in jour-
nalism from New Rochelle
College in New York, is a for-
mer reporter for ’/‘be 'li'remon

said when filling out financial
status forms before each semes-
ter, students living off-campus
should include accurate hous-
ing expenses.

Subsequently, these expenses
are taken into consideration
when loan and grant money is
allocated, according to a finan-
cial aid representative. Students
who request bank loans also
benefit from accounting for off-
campus housing expenses.
After the tuition balance is paid
off, any extra money received
by the university is refunded to
the student.

There are other alternatives,
though. Some students who
find themselves short of rent
money may be unaware of the
assistance available, according

free monetary assistance to peo-
ple moving into housing units
or those “delinquent in rent.”
He said clients can receive up to
$500 that is paid directly to the
landlord.

Reaves, who is the project
director of the housing assis-
tance program, said certain eli-
gibility requirements must be
met before the Urban League
provides assistance. First of all,
the tenant must have already

received an eviction notice and _

letter from the magistrate.

Also, the tenant must provide
proof of salary, two forms of
identification and show that
there is an intent to make future
rent payments to the landlord.

“We have no problem helping
students,” said Reaves. He said
students only account for about
10percent of the organization’s
clientele because students are

unaware of the service.

There are other legal aspects
concerning the rights of both
landlords and tenants. Utility
costs are sometimes not includ-
ed in the total rent price. If a
landlord has this type of system
set up, the Landlord—Tenant Act
requires that “the rate which the
landlord charges tenants may

THE PITI‘ NEWS Thursday, March 31, 1994

not be more than the rate which
that public utility could have
charged the tenant for the same
type of service.”

Landlords in violation of this
law could have a private crimi-
nal complaint filed against them
by the tenant.

The Landlord—Tenant Act also
limits the amount of the security
deposit that a landlord can col-
lect. During one—year leases,
which most students have, the
landlord cannot charge more
than two months’ rent for a
security deposit.

Another legal question is
whether a landlord can raise
rent during the term of the
lease. Sophomore Ann Pielli
said before she signed the lease,
she noticed such a provision
and questioned its legitimacy.

Galzerano said if the lease has
such a provision, the landlord
has that right. He said reasons
for raising rent depend upon
increasing taxes or utility costs.

Pielli said the provision was
taken out of the lease after she
confronted the landlord about
it. Galzerano also said many
tenant-landlord disputes can be
settled just by talking through
the problems. A

Students aren’t statistics

Ttmemagazine reports Cincinnati Public Schools will
soon begin tracking students and teachers by race in
every disciplinary action taken. This is in response to a
20-year ongoing legal battle over whether or not there
is disparity in disciplinary treatment based upon race.
Some members of the faculty say that the disparity is not
based upon race, but upon the number of students with-
in each racial group that get into trouble.

The school board says that statistical tracking is being
used to gather information about racial disparity in disci-
pline. Teachers are afraid that the system will force them
to consider a student’s race before taking disciplinary
action. The teacher's union warns it will leade to disci-
plinary quotas. This would lead to a loss of control in
the classroom, and create an environment which serves
no one. Students must be treated as individuals and
dealt with accordingly. While problems of racial dispari-
ty may exist, they cannot be corrected using statistics
which would lump them into groups. Using statistics is a
ridiculous standard that will not really cause anyone to
change their behavior in a positive manner.

The method being used by the schools in order to set-
tle the lawsuit (statistical tracking in disciplinary cases) is
a panacea which is glossing over a complex problem.
The solutions which will create the best learning envi-
ronment for the kids are what must be most fervently
sought after, not settlements to identify what most peo-
ple agree is already a problem. Multi-faceted solutions
are necessary to create a school system which serves its
students and not a statistical model.

Prevention is the best cure

From now on, there will be metal detectors at some
social events in the William Pitt Union. This Saturday
will mark the first appearance of the detectors at a
social function, and though this is a trial run, it will
probably not be the last.

Organizations which use the space in the William Pitt
Union agreed to having metal detectors earlier this year,
though not as a result of any previous incidents, accord-
ing to graduate assistant manager Robert Delie.

Although the detectors are not in place due to previ-
ous incidents, there have been incidents in the past
warrant them. In February, a former student was arrest-
ed three days after a fight, which began in the union,
for possessing a pistol. He was involved in the fight at a
dance being held in the union, and he threatened to
shoot someone immediately afterwards in the Towers
Lobby. It is better to have the metal detectors and not
need them than to need them and not have them, as
preventing a problem is better than trying to cure one.
It is reassuring that the university is taking these preven-
tative measures before serious problems begin.

Market-based health care is solution

So, “the way America current-
ly rations health care (care only
to those who can afford it) is
unethical”? (The Pitt News edito-
rial, March 21, 1994).

Well, let’s rephrase that: Is a
person who has worked to earn
money, and decides to spend
his earned money on whatever
he sees fit for himself or feels he
needs for himself, acting unethi-
Cally?’ Is it HIS (or HER) money
to spend, or not? And the flip
side, is a doctor who sets a
price he feels is fair to set for his
work, a price that is subject to
competition of other doctors,
acting unethically? Here’s a
clue: we are supposed to be a
free society. And in a free soci-
ety, a person owns the fruits of
his or her labor unless he or she
has consented to a contract to
exchange them for something
else, such as wages, or volun-
tarily gives them away.

If someone else owns the
fruits of one’s labor, without the
consent of the laborer, we call
that slavery. So, either persons
own the money they have
worked and negotiated for, and
therefore can use it as they
wish, or they do not own their
money (a product of their
labor) and they are slaves.

’ Slaves can be “owned” by indi-

viduals, or by groups of people,
including governments. We call
all of these situations “tyranny."
A doctor, as any other
provider of goods or services,

either owns the fruits of his or
her labor, and is free to decide
upon a price for which to sell
them, or else he does not and
is a slave. The fruits of his labor_
are owned and negotiated by
others without his consent.
Now can we guess which sys-
tem is ethical, and which is not?

The hallmark of a free soci-
ety, a society where persons
can exercise the most control

Alan G.
Michael, H

over their destiny, over their
one and only life, is capitalism.
All other systems, be they
socialist or fascist or watered-
down in-betweens, assume that
there is some other owner of
the fruits of one’s labor, some-
one other than the laborer, and
the assumption is made without
the consent of the laborer. That
other owner could be “the
state," “the electorate," “the
Fuhrer," “the people," or “the
poor,” but none of these, by our
ethical standards, is the rightful
owner. To say otherwise is to
support slavery. _
So what is my advice to any-
one who cannot pay as much
for health care? WORK for
more wealth. If your skills aren’t
marketable, CHANGE SKILLS
(or improve existing ones).

Student loans are currently.

available to everyone, so there
is no excuse. (My sister just had
a baby, and she’s staying in col-
lege.) I know that sounds tough
— and government tax and reg-
ulation policies make that
tougher by reducing jobs avail-
able (50 show your opposition
to them!) —— but what is ETHI-
CAL isn’t always easy. I assure
you that wealth hasn’t come
e_asy to me yet, neither. I’m one
of those “not able to pay,” but I
will not clenyothers the right to
what they have earned.

And the “health
resources” need not be limited
or subject to what last weeks
editorial called “rationing." In
laissez—faire capitalism, when
markets expand (i.e. when
more can pay the MARKET
price for goods or services),
there is an incentive for more
people to enter the business of
providing that good or service,
unless the price drops greatly.
So a good plan, for starters,
would be to cut taxes or give
“tax breaks," so that people
have more money in their pock-
et to “be able to pay” for cover-
age or services. Regulations that
increase costs should be
scrapped as well. Let govern-
ment give back some of the
fruits of labor it has taken from
people. Now I call THAT ethi-
cal, and long overdue.

Letter to the Editor

Words are inadequate to express my shock,
dismay and profound disappointment upon find-
ing a 12-page advertising supplement of the so-
called “Right to Life” movement included in The

Pitt News of March 16, 1994.

This supplement was filled with factual errors
and distortion of the issues involving abortion.
Unfortunately, inclusion of this supplement in a
respected newspaper of the university suggests
that these lies and slanders of those who support

newspapers of the university.

It is equally important that both sides of the
issue be presented in a truthful, factual and
responsible manner.

I feel that you have abdicated your responsibili-

tents .

the right of a woman to choose abortion are

endorsed as fact by the university.
The issue of abortion is an important one to

debate in the university setting, and it is crucial
that differing points of View be published in the

Hogs huge in Final Four showdown

The foremost sporting event
of the year has crashed, weaved
and in some cases dominated its
way to its culmination —- the
Final Four of the NCAA champi-
onship. Although this year’s
quartet of Arkansas, Arizona,
Duke and Florida is void of the
classic underdog, the group is
permeated with at least three
teams that weren’t‘ exactly
everyone’s first pick in the
annual bracket polls.

Wait a minute. All four semi-
finalists are at least a No. 3 seed,
and they earned those spots by
putting together outstanding
regular seasons, right? Yeah, but
the regular season doesn‘t mean
diddly in the tournament, and
the seedings don’t guarantee an
extended run.

Most of these teams didn’t get
much attention or respect
before the games began.

In the West. Arizona was
everyone’s favorite choking
artist, having been eliminated in
the first round both of the past
two seasons. The Wildcats were
seen as a prime candidate to fall
in the early rounds once again.
Louisville, Missouri and
California were talked about as
having a better shot than No. 2-
seeded Arizona.

In the Southeast Duke, once
again, is headed for Charlotte.
There's a news flash! Despite
the Blue Devils" affinity for the
Final Four, it was thought that

this Duke squad lacked some of
the scoring prowess of their
predecessors. Duke didn’t have
what it took to advance past the
likes of Purdue and Kentucky.
Well the No. 2-seeded Blue
Devils did, and Coach K and co.
are actually just glad to be here,
if you can believe that one.

In the East, Florida, despite
being a three seed, is quite a
shocker.

Anyone claiming that a team
other than North Carolina,
Connecticut, Temple or Indiana
would come out of the East
probably should have been
laced in a straight jacket.

‘Jack
Becker

But then that is what makes
this tournament so special. The
Gators have no marquee names,
yet they got by Donyell “I got
something here in my throat"
Marshall, ahem, and a UConn
team that had that Sweet
Sixteen matchup all but won.
Florida had even been picked
by certain erratic prognostica-
tors to lose to James Madison in
the first round, but they man-
aged to escape the
strongest bracket in the tourna-
ment.

In the Midwest, Arkansas,

after being ranked No. 1 the lat-
ter part of the year, is the one
team left in the field that would
have suffered a major letdown if
it would have failed to reach
Charlotte.

The Razorbacks should be the
remaining favorite to win it all,
and yes that stood even before
Bill “I can’t name one guy on
the team besides Corliss
Williamson” Clinton became
such a big fan.

Here are some of the things
you can look for in this week-
end’s semiﬁnals.

Arkansas vs. Arizona

Arkansas has it all. They’Ve
got a strong inside game and a
frantic, lights-out shooting out-
side game to go along with both
a fast-paced transition threat
and a slow-it-down half—court
offense with main-man
Williamson.

Williamson is a raging bull on
the blocks with deft moves off
of them. No player on any team
left in the tournament can hang
with this guy.

The key here is, of course, the
guard matchups. Arkansas’
Corey Beck and Clint McDaniel
are not the same caliber as
Arizona’s Kahlid Reeves and
Damon Stoudamire, but the
Arkansas guards are the only
duo to have the quickness to
stop Arizona on the perimeter. ’

Pavement
Crooleed Ra in, Croo/eed Rain
Matador Records

In 1992, Pavement released
Slanted and Enchanted and
gained a few more fans. They
toured. They got a new drum-
mer and toured some more.
Very simple. Now it’s 1994, and
they just released Crooleed
Ram, Crooleecl Rain. They are
touring, doing interviews and
even getting a video done. It’s
starting to get complex.
They’ve appeared in Spin and
Details magazines. They also
never wanted to do a video,
but neither did the Smiths or
the Replacements. Are they
selling out? No way.

“Cut Your Hair,” the first sin-
gle, is a pretty catchy tune.
“Yooh-yooh-yooh-yooh-yooh~
yooh-yooh” are the opening
sounds. Steve Malkmus’s lyrics
aren’t the most complex, but
that’s not his point — if it
sounds good, it’s part of the
song. Simple. It doesn’t take
too much imagination to like
this song. A

The lyrics in “Range Life”
tells of a confusion between
two “alternative” bands. “Out

told Details magazine, they
both start with “S” and he was
making them up on the spot.
Simple. Also, when he sings,
“f**k,” it’s so casual. Most bands
scream the word as loud as
possible to show how angry
they are. But there’s no angst in
this word.

“Silence Kit,” “Elevate Me
Later” and “Gold Sound Z” will
only appeal to the Pavement
fans, not the person who liked
the video and bought the CD at
the mall. The songs are basical-
ly what Pavement has been
doing since its beginning. Like
driving fingernails into the skin
of a blackboard, the sound just
bleeds out.

“Stop Breathin,’ “Newark
\X/ilder,” “Heaven is a Truck”
and “Fillmore Jive” are pretty
mellow. I just want to sit down,
smoke a bud and drink some
tainted liquid. To feel
Pavements tune, picture REM’s
early recordings Mzmrzzcr and
Recleonmg. (They cover REM’s
“Camera,” on the “Cut Your
Hair” single.)

Pavement is making the best
of a situationthat has gotten
complex. They don’t want cor-
porate sponsorship. They are
just a band, and that’s simple to
understand.

THE prrr NEWS, Thursday, March 31, 1994 I

. .-‘.¢f-

Couch .
4 song EP
(Bulb)

No Wave is alive and well in
Chicago.’ ‘

Flashback:

The abrasive style of music
known as No Wave came
about in late ‘70s New York as
a backlash to the trendy styl-
ized “new wave” everyone was
buzzing about. Folks have
claimed Sonic Youth came out
of that movement, but they

have voiced their dislike of the ’

music in the past.

Brian Eno produced the com-
pilation No New Yorle in 1978
which featured seminal noise-
makers like vocalist Lydia
Lunch, saxophone abuser
James Chance and noise gui-
tarist Arto Lindsay. The album
was noisy from beginning to
end, but the punk attitude that
pervaded it made it a good lis-
ten.

Back to 1993:

Chances are, the members of
Couch never heard No New
Yorla, but the four songs on
their 7” El’ feature the same
level of cacophony and enthu-

siasm that made No New York
great. The bancl’s musical abili-
ty seems virtually nonexistent,
but their spirit, or should I say
their delivery, more than makes
up for it.

On “Haters of Couch” the
vocalist lets loose with a hoarse
wail that sounds a lot like the
Boredoms’ Eye Yamatsuka.
Clocking in at 1:40, Couch
knows that the best punk
sounds '8 push it to the limit and
keep it brief. If the lyrics con-
demn the band’s enemies, you
can’t tell by listening.

The next song, “Green and
Red Look Alike,” sounds like
two minutes of someone taking
a stylus and scraping it across a
record. Put this on the next
time you want uninvited guests
to leave your party.

“The Coffe’ Gun” gives a nod M

to Chance’s band, the
Contortions, nwith its basic
heartbeat drumming, scraping
guitar and sax whines. “T ime—
Travel Man” sports some organ
dooclling. A mangled blues riff
tries to take shape midway
through, only to get stomped
on by the ranting vocals before
they get cut off.

Normally I hate bands that
try to get away with making a
racket for racket’s sake. Couch
rises above the bulk of the
noisemeisters for a few simple
but crucial reasons. They don’t
do the same basic thing in
every song; they seem to put
some thought into what they’re
doing instead of just making as
much noise as possible, even
on “Green and Red.” Finally
instead of sounding serious,
Couch sounds like they are just
trying to have a good time.

“I Think Ijust Want to Go
Away/ Pull It Together”
Kokopop

If you close your eyes while
listening to ‘-‘I Think Ijust Want
to Go Away,” the ethereal
sounds that swirl around your
head could bring to mind
another record label that spe-
cializes in this style: 4AD.

Tiny Lights, who released
two albums since 1988, merges
4AD’s atmospheric sound with
songwriting that recalls mid-
’60s folk rock. The result
sounds both pretty and mov-
ing.

“I Want to Go Away” features
droning guitars with awah-wah
violin that sounds like a psych
guitar. Over top of it, Donna
Croughn provides whispery
vocals. The song picks up the
dynamics when the rhythm sec-
tion kicks in, but instead of tak-
ing it backdown for verse
number two, the song ends.
When it’s done, you’re left feel-
ing warm and satisfied. The
warmth continues on “Pull It
Together,” where guitarist John
Hamilton joins Croughn for
some folky harmonies.

The Jon Spencer Blues‘

Explosion
f‘Tra in#5/ Train#1 ”
In the Red

“All aboard the BLUES
EXPLOSION!!!” What Would the
blues be without trains? Don't
worry about it because they
influenced every bluesman
from Muddy Waters to the man
himself, Jon Spencer. If you
were at’ the Metropol, you
know what I mean. The Blues
Explosion chugs, spatters,
clangs and burps smoke more
furiously than the ‘Broadway
Limited en route to Chicago.

“Train#1” is pure rock and
roll. The crazy voodoo magic
of the Theremin starts a geog-
raphy lesson of the blues. Does
that train go through
Pittsburgh? Yes it does, non-
believers, and “don’t forget
Hoboken, .N.].!” “Train#5” is an
inarticulate blues/soul
harangue — whoopin’ and a-
moanin’. Lawdyl The guitar
hook is so‘ driving and com-
manding, it’s a wake up call:

iGet off of your hipster ass and

get possed by the Blues!

Just to set it-straight, this
spectacular record ain’t no 7”! I
think Jon would agree, it is a
bonafide 45 rpm record, peri-
od. This is vintage rock right
down to the jukebox packag-
ing: white sleeve with a little
red sticker.

Tiger Trap/Henry's Dress
“Astronauticavl Music Festival”
Slumberland Records

Now PLAYING

S-§

Slumberland has released a
gem. The “Astronautical Music
Festival” is a split 7'“, which
means more bang for your
buck. By now you know Tiger
Trap, the defunct cult pop
heros from Sacramento. I have
yet to hear a bad song from
these guys. I-Ienry’s Dress is a
young band from Albuquerque.
This song is their first commer-
cial release. Excitingll

Tiger Trap’s “Alien Space
Song” is sort of psychedelic. It’s
quite mellow, full of lush vibra-
to guitar. The vocals harmonize
and interweave a luscious
melody with the bass. The
drums are played masterfully,
and the rhythms are accented
by the often ignored triangle.
Don’t get me wrong, the song

.won’t put you to sleep —— your

toe will be tapping right along
to this catchy tune.

“Feathers,” the Henry’s Dress
song, is bombastic, noisy and
dense. Mix My _ Bloody
Valentine and Codeineltogether
and you might come out with
their sound. “Feathers” drones
and feeds back and taunts you
not to like it. I like it. You
probably will, too. Surprisingly,
the vocals are audible, and the
noisy,el.emen.ts are not over-
bearing. A great conclusion to a
lo-fi treat. ’

ther’s funeral on the back of a
Harley, escorted by a friend in
black leather. It’s the old vs.
the new and female vs. male as
svelte young Fanny (Helena
Bergstrom) and her menagerie
of cross-dressing, cabaret-per-
forming friends take over
pappy’s manor house and

‘ refuse to sell the land to local

patriarch Axel Flogfalt (Sven
Wollter).

It’s too bad this little scenario
works up to a silly clash-of—the-
stereotyped—titans when a pack
of hysterical townswomen run
out to the manor house to stop
Miss Fanny from turning the
place into a rumored whore-

house. Nutley lacks a feel for

rural life. The women are petty,
repressed and little else besides
bumbling. Fanny’s cabaret
cronies are a similar sideshow.
She and her black leather com-
panion, Zac (Rikard \‘(/olff),
have an offbeat relationship
that Nutley explores with some

depth, and Fanny gains some
allies in two local buffooning
brothers, but the rest is all 8X10

glossy.

Much like last year’s too-
sweet success Ijnchcmtecl April,
this film begins by registering
pointed and amusing com-
plaints against the patriarchy
but follows those up by sugar-
coating the consequences into
a truly candy-assed conclusion.

Guided by Voices have been
playing great rock and roll in
Dayton for the last twelve
years.

This record is chock full o’
lo-fi brilliance. All seven songs
are great. The songs are long
enough to be interesting, but
short enough to escape redun-
dancy. “Matter Eater Lad” kicks
in with a plodding guitar riff
and unleashes a powerful cho-
rus, alluding to a comic book
hero. “Broadcaster House” is a
drum showcase, while “Hunter
Complex" and “Pink Gun” are
complete fuzz rock extravagan-
zas. Swelling and throbbing
guitars make “Scalping the
Guru” creep up on you. That’s
just the first side!

The B-side contains two
songs that show the delicate,
but intense side of the band.
"Grandfather \Y/estinghouse” is
a mid—tempo number that
showcases the raunchy, then
sweetly melodic sides of Robert
Pollard’s vocals. “Johnny

electric guitars together to form
a beautiful ballad. The chorus,
“I am Johnny Appleseed  is
so contagious that I haven’t

Jim and Artie Mitchell
by john Hubner
Dell paperback; $5.99

Like me, if you are waiting for Tonya
Harding's autobiography or Lorena
Bobbitt’s tell-all. you may not be satisfied
with anything else. Yet Bottom Feeders
serves a healthy helping of good old—fash—
ioned. mind-numbing, sexual antics of
two American heroes.

With the- title of "Bottom Feeders," I
expected that Hubner was going to por-
tray 21 doom and gloom world of life in

the sex industry. Certainly, with all the-.

drug abuse and the eventual murder of
Artie by his brother, this is a tragedy.

Bottom Feeders chronicles the lives of
Jim and Artie Mitchell, late-’60s pornogra-
phers, hedonists and libertines. From the
work of these pioneering brothers, the
American motion picture pornography
industry emerges.

Bottom Feeders is more than anecdotes
about the movie pornography industiy. To
the Mitchell brothers, their films were a
rebellion against American sexual values.
and like all rebellions, it ended with vio-
lence.

 

In 1991, Jim entered Artie’s home in a
suburb outside of San Francisco and shot
Artie about eight times. The trial captured
the attention of the national press. The
events leading up to the murder should
be left for the reader to find out.

Bottom Feeders’ importance is that it
tells a story often kept quiet in’ polite soci-
ety. By the late 1960s, a revolution was
underway. Sexual rules were being rewrit-
ten by men and even women. By the
early ‘70s. as the Vietnam War was end-
ing, thousands of migrants on their way to
San Francisco and Haight-Ashbury took
part in a _new sexual revolution. From
these counterculture migrants. the Mitchell
brothers found their stars.

Mitchells’ actors were rebels, flaunting
their sexuality on screen. Sixties drifter.
George McDonald, watching a Mitchell
film with an actor who was not perform-
ing adequately, knew he could be a
star — and he kept it up for many years.

In the mid-’8()s, Elisa Florez. a daughter
of a prominent Utah Republican, rebelled
against her prim upbring by transforming

with one of the first “safer—sex" porn
movies.

In 1973, the New York Court of Appeals
judged the original Behind the Green Door
so obscene that it would even violate the
community standards of the so-called bib-
lical cities of sin. Sodom and Gommorah.

jim and Artie responded by producing.

Sodom and Gommora/3; The Last Sezberz
Days.

But of course. these bohemians endured
the trials and tribulations of life on the
edge. Drug abuse and manipulation vio-
late this Eden. Be/ytrzd tbe Greer; Door star
Marilyn Chambers battled drug abuse
spanning her acting career.‘ Chuck
Traynor, Chambers’ manager and hus-
band, was previously married to Linda
Lovelace. Traynor allegedly ‘‘hypnotized’‘

‘ Lovelace into performing in Mitchell

brother films. such as Deep 7'/97-‘oat, while
married to her.

Bottom Feeders is not just for aficiona-
does of porn films. (I shook my first rattle

tion from writing that last paper of the

cated with hatred for,this group
and all others — but I don't, so
I love Tindersticks.

Tindersticks have the same
ﬂavour as a band like Gallon
Drunk or newer Nick Cave
records. There’s an element of
Gothic abandonment, and the
lilt ofa good lounge group.
Toyish drums and keyboards
combine with a David Lynch-
film vocal describing an atmos-
phere, a space. Listening to the
lyrics of either of these songs is

I like listening to another instru-

ment —— not the vocals, but the
lyrics. The words weave
around the simplicity of the
music’s dark pop structure,
especially on “Marbles,” a
poem executed on top of an
unlistening tune. Tindersticks’
vocals are distanced from the
music, like being alone in a bar
— so much activity around, so
little contact.

On “For Those,” the band
creates a Sinatra feeling, but
the modern Sinatra, stumbling

through his words and being
cut off while speaking. The
sound is a character in itself, a
low, pride-wounded lounge
singer, without too much hope
or anywhere to go. Once again,
Tindersticks’ victory is in creat-
ing a link with the listener and
a separation within the music
at the same time.

Don’t listen to the papers,
just sit at the bar. Alone.

product of this syndrome — a

band that takes lounge deadly ,

serious, and plays it with intent
and mindful energy.

Named after a ﬂaming cock-
tail, the recipe for which domi-
nates the back cover of their
full-length CD, Combustible
Edison plays and sings with a
touch of class that most “seri-
ous” musicians cannot achieve.
This record swerves and spins
around “Cry Me A River,” mak-
ing it a modern statement of
purpose, a battle cry of the
low-key, a tlteme sgng to the
Combustible Edsion Nightly
News. The B-side, an instru-
mental in the same, soon—to-be-
trademark style, lets the musi-
cians of the group come for-
ward and strut their stuff. Rises,
falls, pushes, pulls; the song is
an emotional tug of war that
always seems to end with the
listener lying prone‘ on an old
piano, the half-melted ice click-
ing around the glass.

These three records are all
straight from the garage. Real,
American (North American, that
is), tune-the—engine rock n’ roll.
I say North American because
lots of the best garage rock
these days drops down to us
from our northern neighbors in
Vancouver.

Take, for The

instance,

Smugglers. This is a fine piece V

of band. They’ve got everything
that garage rock should have
clothes -and schticks,
chunky, super-electric guitars,
blazing harmonica, even at gui-
tar player nicknamed “Smokin’
Gun.” They play live more
often than they eat, and suck
down jiigemeister like it’s a
Shamrock Shake. There’s not
any way to listen to this record
while sitting down or frowning.
If you want to frown though,

reigning king of garage, a

Nardwuar runs a label called
Nardwuar the Human Serviette
Records. It’s a great label,
spawning The Smugglers and
others like them. Nardwuar
also, for fun, has a band called
The Evaporators. It’s really too
bad. I listened to “Tm Going to
France” right after hearing The
Smugglers’ record, and contin-
ued jumping up and down.
Unfortunately, the record kept
playing after the title song, and
I heard “Nardwuar vs. Mikhail
Gorbachev,” a news report
describing Nardwuar’s foolish
antics at a press conference for
the former Soviet leader. By the
time “\Y/innipeg ‘64” comes on,
an annoying diatribe concern-
ing Neil Young’s musical fall
from grace, the listener is
pressing stop and pulling out
their Smugglers record, ready
to hear some real music again.

_ If The Smugglers is getting
overplayed, it’s time to go
local. The Mount McKinleys are
Pittsburgh’s answer to Canada’s
call. A brilliant combination of
garage and surf rock, the
McKinleys’ new record, Going
to Pieces, surpasses most of the
rest of the garage flock. Their
lo-fidelity, bare-boned attack

on rock ‘n’ roll makes me
proud to live in this town.
Going to Pieces is an honest,
‘60s style uprising in which the
vocals and guitars drop in and
out from above, always keep-
ing the listeners on their toes.
“Theme from ‘T he Killers” is a
Shadowy Men-esque surf
instrumental that puts most of
modern surf music to shame.
Melodic, almost vocal, guitar
lines running around. a driving,
reverb-infested rhythm insist on
full attention from the ears,
while the feet get to steppin’.

If I was on the proverbial
Desert Isle, I’d choose the
locals. -b_y]ustz'n Hopper

THE PI1"r’N1=.\ivs,T1iui-sdax,‘ March“ 31‘, 1224   _
Riley magz'c,'Nz'que fans pathetic, Manning

Scott Bullett for Willis Travis?
No, Travis Willis. No, Andy
Travis.

Sorry, that is not the type of
arm that the Buccos need to be
“stockpiling,” as Cam Bonifay
said today of a trade that isn’t
going to go down in any read-
able baseball history.

The absolute laughingstock
that is the Pirates’ pitching staff
needs some serious help, and it
ain’t coming from some scrub
minor-leaguer who the Cubs —
another weak staff —— do not
need.

What Jim Leyland begs for is a
little more than a warm body —
he needs a couple of decently
young pitchers who can help
now and who can be counted
on for the next couple of years
to do some damage.

The best trade candidate for
the Buccos happens to be play-
ing right field and goes by the
name of Orlando Merced.
Merced exploded last year
(before fizzling late, due, in
some part, to injury) and can
help some club get on base and
score some runs.

The Bucs could swing a deal
with Merced and pick up Mike
Morgan, also from the Cubs:
Granted, he was not a .500
pitcher last season and may be a
bit of a stretch, but right now he
would be more dependable
than Denny Neagle.

The Twins would probably
have to unload another ‘body,
but Scott Erickson is facing his
last chance in the Twin
Cities.

Would the Phils give up oft-
injured Tyler Green? A Wes
Chamberlain/Merced platoon in
right would give each his at-bats
against their strength (right-lefty

n1atch—ups), and the combo of

power in Chamberlain and aver-
age in Merced would make
them an even more devastating
offensive club.

Plus, what do the Bucs have
to lose with an immensely tal-
ented pitcher? It’s obvious that
Midre Cummings is going to
play right ﬁeld, and while we’re
waiting for him, how ‘bout a
Dave Clark/Brian Hunter pla-
toon in right? It’s a gamble, but
Green can give Bonifay what he
doesn’t have -—— a bona fide
arm.

The best bet? Well it might
have been the Mets’ Anthony
Young. Traded yesterday to
those pesky Cubs for Jose
Visciano, he is a prospect that
just doesn’t live up (or down) to

his 189-game (it seemed) losing
streak. Yeah, yeah, who does,
right?

Well,’ as he suffered through
his losing streak last year, there
was more than one scout who
swore up and down that he
didn’t understand why Young
was getting beaten (try some
horrible defense). He has got a
live fastball and a decent-
enough slider to make him a
wanted commodity in the hot-
stove league. Throw in a decent
pitching coach and you have a
talent with a chance to get a
new start.

The Mets had a chance to
dump him any time during The
Streak or even in the offseason,
but he went into Port St. Lucie
and pitched well. Besides, now
that he’s in the Windy City, the
little bears have thickened their
thin staff just a little more.

-The day when Jerry Jones
looks back at the folly that this
past week was is coming very
soon. Jimmy Johnson is an ego-
maniac too, but more than any-
thing else he is a great football
coach, and Jones got too much

in his way.
But it was more than just an
occasional bump off the

pedestal that irked Johnson.
Jones would never let his hand-

picked head coach bask in the
glow of a team that -he assem-
bled piece—by—piece without try-
ing to get his foot on the media
platform with his sick little smile
and annoying Texas twang.
Jones’ attitude was so bad, in
fact, that Johnson has been vin-
dicated by the press already for
leaving a two-time Super Bowl
champion, when many other
coaches would have been
laughed at by now.

Johnson will hook up with

Jason
Brame

some other team after some
time to cool off, but because of
Jones’ bottomless pocket book,
it will never be as easy to build
a team as good as the ‘Boys.
Don’t mistake that for a prop for
Jones — anyone who has a
checkbook with some zeros and
a pen to write with can fill the
same role that he did. "It’s just
that Johnson will have to work
a little harder to build a pathetic
club into champions

And what a slap in the face it
was for Jones to step in and

announce former Oklahoma
University head man Barry
Switzer his new coach just
hours after he watched Johnson
roll. Switzer hasn’t coached
since being ousted at OU six
years ago, and he has never
served any time in the NFL. He
will inherit a team built up by
Johnson, a team that, with any
type of coaching, is guaranteed
to return to the playoffs.

No, Jones and Switzer are
going to find out that it was
Johnson’s knowledge and ana-
lyst-precise preparation that
built the team, not Jones’ butt-
kissing of the media and foreign
dignitaries.

The city of Dallas is going to
turn hard on the owner when
things get lean. When you have
a big taste of success, it’s hard
to wash it away with some
Kool-Aid, which is what Jones is
trying to do with Switzer, a local
boy from just north of the Lone
Star State. G

Emmitt.Smith already hinted
that he may not want to play for
just Jones. If he rolls, so do a lot



electric in NBA

of wins and a lot of players.
Wasn’t it Smith who was so
close to Johnson during the sea-
son and during the holdout?
Wasn’t it Jones who tried to
hold Smith over the fire until he
found out that it was he who
was burning?

That team has too much talent
not to make it to the playoffs
next year.

But the year after that, they
won’t be around when the sec-
ond-season starts.

Men's tennis wins 6-1

By Ed Ziegenfuss
Staff Writer

On Wednesday, the Pitt men’s
tennis team took to the courts
against the Penguins of
Youngstown State University.

Pitt (7-8) took the match 6-1.
“We beat a good team, and
they’ll be ready for us next time
we play them,” head coach
George Dieffenbach said.

Braden Doherty and Brad
Wade were winners for the
Panthers in doubles over Robert
Taylor and George Laskos, by a
score of 8-2.

In other doubles action,
James Chronister and Jeff
Campbell won 8-4 over Vince
Marino and Mike Sciarra, and
Chris McShane and Dave
Dumpel bested Ken Cataland
and Jon Babovnik 8-4.

“There was a little bit of trou-
ble to start with, but then we
finished it out,” McShane said.

In singles action, the surprise
of the day came in the first
match when Doherty was
defeated by Taylor in straight
sets 6-4, 6-4.

The Panther team, however,
picked up the slack by not los-
ing another singles match.

Wade defeated Marino (6-4,
6-1) and Chronister bested
Laskos (7-5, 6-3). Campbell (6-2,
6-1), Dumpel (6-1, 6-1) and Matt

   
     
 

Mills (7-6, 6-0) also had victories
for the blue and gold.

Mills’ win in a tiebreak in the
first set was a dramatic one as
he fell behind 5-1 but came
back to win 10-8.

The Panther victory was a
good one, but there is a sense
of dissatisfaction about the facil-
ities at Pitt.

“It’s always hard adjusting to
these [Cost Center] courts,”
Dumpel said about the tennis
facilities.

“There is no home court —

advantage here because the ball
never bounces the same way
twice. Other schools have beau-
tiful facilities, and I’m happy
that we play away the rest of
the year,” he continued. “It’s a
tough adjustment to these
courts for our team,” said
Dieffenbach.

“Most of our practices are out-
side right now. We make the
best of it. Smart players find a
way to win.”

It is tough for the Panthers to
play all their away matches on
such, good hardcourts and not
have that same opportunity
here at home, but for now they
will just have to roll with the
punches. 4

Around the net: Pitt’s next
two matches are Friday at
Robert Morris College and
Monday at Edinboro University.

  
  

THE PITT NEWS,Thursday, March 31, 1994

Brame

Continued from page 7

March.
The contribution of Derek
Harper — a mid-season

acquisition from purgatory
(i.e. the Dallas Mavericks) —
can not be understated. The
veteran has averaged 15
points the past eight games
and has shot 59 percent in
that stretch.

“I feel like I had to step
up,” he told USA Today. “The
team needed me and others
to do it. I’ve just got to keep
it up.”

Riley kept the team togeth-
er with a little Reno
Relaxation (he took the team
to Nevada for some R&R to
clear their heads) and by
turning to and building on
what got them to the top of
the East already — defense.
In their 14 straight, the
Knicks have held their oppo-
nent to fewer than 90 points
10 times and are holding
opponents to 42 percent
shooting.

The Knicks have turned
NBA philosophy on its head
— in the league, everyone
gets their points. Instead of
blowing out scoreboard
lights, the Knicks have kept
the clamps so tight on other
teams that they don’t need to

singe nets to win.

-Some people can’t accept
change. Some don’t want to
accept change. Some are just
dumb.

How else can you describe
that small legion of folks
who still look at Atlanta’s
trade of Dominique
“Conscience, what con-
science?” Wilkins for Danny
Manning as a mistake? The
Hawks have, with only 14
points a game from the oh-
so-relieved-to-be-the-hell-
out-of-LA Manning, taken
their play to the next level.
Their improvement is a
direct result of Manning’s
unselfishness, court vision
and presence.

With Manning you get
leadership, unselfishness,
heart, unselfishness, knowl-
edge of the game and
unselfishness.

With ‘Nique you get 20
points a game and a big-time
dunk once a week. .

We’ll be watching the
Hawks in the Eastern
Conference Finals.

We'll be watching the
Clips in the lottery once
again.
