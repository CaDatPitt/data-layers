HE VOTE DONE

Residents re—elect the youngest mayor in city ’s history with 55 percent of the vote while Independent candidates trail behind

Liz Navratil
News Editor

Luke Ravenstahl promised Pitts-

burgh residents a “bright future”
when he accepted his re-election
for mayor last night.

Ravenstahl —- who earned
about 55 percent of the vote yes-
terday — said he “didn’t neces-
sarily aspire to this office” when
he became mayor three years ago,
following the death of then-mayor
Bob O’Connor.

“But we accomplished some
wonderful things,” Ravenstahl
said, referencing the economic
redevelopment that prompted
President Barack Obama to host
the G—20 Summit in Pittsburgh

last month.

Ravenstahl, who will begin his
ﬁrst féur—year term in office after
inauguration this January, said he
thinks more work needs to be
done to improve public safety, as
well as the city’s ﬁnancial stand-
ing.

He said he will meet with City
Council Monday to discuss the
2010 budget, which includes a
proposal to tax college students
more than $100 a year to help
provide revenue for the city’s pen-
sion fund.

Ravenstahl said he thinks non-
proﬁt institutions, like Pitt, need
to do more to contribute to the city.
He said he hopes’ Pitt would cover

the tax itself, but that the city will

tax students if it needs to.

 

“They’re not ideal,” Ravenstahl
said of the taxes, “but they’re

something we have to do.”

Ravenstahl said he is “excited

though he doesn’t yet have one a
planned and that he looks forward

to_ seeing his wife, Erin, and son,
Cooper, more often.

I’m ready to lead.

to lead. I’m ready to lead.”
He also said he was relieved
to be re—elected. Ravenstahl said

he hopes to take a short vacation, ’

iSchool creates ‘Cult’ website

New site a forum for networking, cultural events

Natalie Bigley
For The Pitt News

PittCult is looking for new members.

But don’tworry, PittCult is not used
for religious worship orbrainwashing,
although the name might seem rnis—
leadingto some people. _

Peter Brusilovsky, a professor in
Pitt’s School oflnformation Sciences, or
iSchool, said PittCult — shortfor Pitts-

burgh Cultural — is merely aworking
name for the new cultural website.

Danielle Lee, founderofthe website
and a doctoral student in the school,
saidthe siteisapublicsocialnetworking
device that allows people to ﬁnd infor-
mation on cultural events in the area.

Around 90 people have signed up to
use the website, she said. Some events
listed include museum trips, operas,
plays, ﬁlms, tours and concerts,

The beauty ofthewebsite, Leesaid,
is that it’s more than just an informa-
tion tool —— it’s a place for Pittsburgh
socialites to utilize open communica-
tion through event

Jumpingoifofthewebsites homep-
age, located at pit;tcult.sis.pit1:.edu, is a

anyone living in or around the Pius-

“The websiteis importantbecause
it marks the variety of Pitt culture ——
and ithas alot, but onlyasmall amount
of people know about it,” Brusilovsky
said.

Lee came up with the idea for her
graduate dissertation because she was
interested inthe concept of networking.
She saidtitatthesocialnetworkingbase
is a relatively new ﬁeld with very few
people exploring it—andpairingsocial
networkingwithlocal artistic events is
not very common.

“Iwanttogetasmanyusersaspos—

any money. I just want to conduct re-
search.”

Lee said there is potential for a lot

ofwebsite growthfor PittCult. She sug-

gested that the site might eventually
offer discotmted tickets for events.

Brusilovsky said PittCult shares
different infomtationthanmost other
sites on the Internet.

“Flickr allows people to share pic-
tures. You”Dube allows people to share
videos. Our system allows people to
share information about culture in
Pittsburgh,” he said.

Polls less packed this year

Fewer students,-residents of Oakland voted on Election Day

Christen DiClaudio ’

For The Pitt News

Voter tumout foryesterday’s mayoral
election paled in comparison to last
year’s presidential election.

Poll clerks estimated that about3O
percent of registered voters showed
up, compared to the 55 percent tum-
out during lastyear’s presidential elec-
tion. The voter tumout was similar
to thelast regular mayoral election,

election, particularly if their parents '

don’t live around here.

Some students agreed and said
that they don’t consider Pittsburgh
their real home. '

Pitt sophomore Sarah Ivins, who

_ isoriginallyfromthe Fox Chapelarea,

said she didn’t vote because she is ill-
informed about the candidates.

Although candidates from both

parties had campaign signs posted »

in front of the polling locations,
there were more people working on
behalf of the Democratic party than
the GOP. ' ‘ '

While Republican candidates were
on the ballot for afew elections, May-
or Luke Ravenstahl was the nominee

for both parties, after winning the
Democratic primary election and
the Republican primary as a write-
in candidate.

Pittsburgh hasn’t had aRepublican
mayor since the 1930s.

Poll clerks atthe Synod Hall voting
location on Craigstreet said thatwhile
the presidential election brought an
even mix of senior citizens and stu-

the polling place yesterday.

Davis said the lack of competi-

tion inthe mayoral race was the main ~

cause_ of the low turnout. ,
“Ravenst:ahl is going to be a win-

Some people, however, were ada-

Pitt sophomore Noah Haibach

- searchedthe ranks of mayoral and Su-

a list of who he should vote for.

“I’d like to have a mayor who

'Ravenstahl’s 2006 rise to office after

Some students said they didn’t

for president in Allegheny county,
they did not have to register again to
vote for the local politicians.

Other students felt unsure about
what offices were upfor election.
Some, like Pitt sophomore Chelsea

“Politics will do whatever theywill ‘

"Majority Clerk Barbara DeRiso ,

Editorial

arlierthis week, President Ba-
rack Obama said the United
States plans to abolish a travel
and immigration ban against those
with HIV. At face value, this means
more people with HIV could poten-
tially enter the country and dissemi-
nate the disease -—— but let’s not be
paranoid here.
More than 1 million people in the
United States live with HIV or AIDS.
The Center for Disease Control esti-
mates that in 2006 there were ap-
proximately56,300 new cases ofHIV.
AIDS and HIV certainly aren’t as prev-
alent in the United States as in parts
of Southern Africa where, in some
regions, more than 15 percent of the

, adult population is living with HIV.

But we’re far from disease-free.

Good riddanee to
HIV travel ban

/

from comingto the United States.As a
result, the United States has not held a
major international conference on the
disease since 1993, according the As-
sociated Press. By liftingthe ban and
allowing entry to these activists, their
subsequent contributions to battling
and spreading knowledge about HIV
seem an adequate repercussion.
Obama stressed that by lifting
the ban, the United States is helping-
to dissolve the stigma against those
with HIV. The ban was initiated in
the late ’80s —- atime when HIVwas
still a new disease and hysteria over
its spread even dictated, law. Now the
law seems antiquated. In 1987, HIV
was placed on the U.S. Public Health

tagious diseases,” and HIV positive

Howard 4 4

There is no absolute account of how many
children have died as a result of Christian Science
neglect, buta1998 smdyinthe journal Pediatrics
reported that 172 childrenwhose parents withheld

medicaltreatmentfromthemforreligious reasons H -

died between 1975 and 1995. Ofthese deaths, “I40
fatalities were ﬁrom conditions forwhichsurvival
rates with medical care would have exceeded 90
percent” and only 43 of the 172 reported deaths
were ever prosecuted.

Because Christian Scientists rarely reporttheir
children’s illness to doctors, hospitals or other
authorities, these 172 documented deaths have to
be understood as only afraction ofthe number of
childrenwho have died as aresult of not receiving
medical treatment for religious reasons.

Not content to simply see state laws enacted

that protect negligent parents from prosecution, ,

lobbyists for the Church of Christ, Scientist ap-
proached universal health care laws as a way to
further legitimize this theology and even have it
funded by the state.

When Massachusetts enactedastatewide uni-
versalhealth careprogramin2o06, Christian Sci-
entists successfully lobbied to include a provision
inthe billthatallowedpeople to opt—out ofthe plan
for religious reasons. The Church lobbyists then
secured reimbursements forfaith healingsimilar
to the provision in the current Senate bill.

As a result, taxes in the state oflvlassachusettls
are used to pay for  healing and other“medi—

tax dollars used in violation of Constitution

cal” programs offered by Christian Scientists.

Although the developments inMassachusetts
are troubling, the implications of such provisions
being applied at the federal level could be disas-
lrous.

First, the expenditure of federal tax dollars on
religious services constitutes a clear breach of the
ConstitIution’s Establishment Clause and the very
spirit of the doctrine ofseparalion of church and
state. These Constitutional concerns effectively
scuttled the Christian Science provisions in the
House healthcarebilland currently representthe
most effective argument to defeat similar provi-
sions in the Senate.

Second, ifthe provision remains inthe bill and
the bill is passed, faith healingwould be federally
elevated to the level of clinical medicine. This could
grant Christian Scientists and other similar sects
greater legal legitimacy and give them a stronger
legal claimto controltheir children’s medical care
in the case of a lifethreatening illness. ,

This provision in the Senate health bill is an
example of just how dangerous government in-
volvementcanbeinhealthcarewhenfringe inter-
est groups are able to exert sufficient pressure on
legislators in order to have their quackery recog-
nized as medicine and ﬁ.In_ded~by the state.

It may not work when ‘He ’s Just Not'ﬂtatIntoYou’ 

Natalie Bell
Senior Staff Writer

So you think you want to be in
love?

That’s the title of the lecture
Greg Behrendt and his wife Amiira
Ruotola will give on Nov. 6 at the
Byham Theater, which will take
the audience through the entire
process of being in and out of a
relationship.

“It’s all done very tongue-in-
cheek, and it’s very funny, and
it’s done‘ like the books. We have
never pretended to be therapists
or experts or anything like that,
we’re just two people sharing our
experiences on a group level,” Beh-
rendt said.

For those unaware, Behrendt
was co-author, along with “Sex and
the City” story editor Liz Tuccillo,
of “He’s Just Not That Into You,”
the advice book that inspired
women everywhere to re-evaluate
whether their dates’ unclear signs
were really just his manifestations
of his lukewarm feelings. The book
reached the No. 1 spot on multiple
best-seller lists and was adapted

into an A—list headlined ﬁlm last
year.

Behrendt and his ‘wife Ruotola
have written two other best-sellers
together, “It’s Called a Break Up
Because It’s Broken” and “It’s Just
a Bleeping Date.” Their decision to
make their next project a lecture
was based off a suggestion and
allows Behrendt to combine his
20 years of stand—up experience
with the couple’s experience and
knowledge of relationships.

The couple looks back at their _

own dating disasters and tries to
pass their experience on to people
who feel like they aren’t succeeding
in their romantic relationships.
Behrendt says the point isn’t to
make people feel stupid, its to
remind them, sometimes less-
than-gently, that they should be
thinking of themselves and what
makes them happy.

“It’s really hard to choose you
and choose decisions for you and

make the tough decisions whether.

it’s not eating carbs or dating bet-
ter people,” he said. =
Behrendt admits that he doesn’t
consider his talents a gift, but a
skill — one he’s honed after spend-

ing a life around women.
“It’s a pretty simple formula.

I generally pretetlcl.i,that.yo.ufre..,...riosities...Thatinteraction~—is~the --

my sister and that gives me two

inroads: one, that I love you,,andv
two, that I don’t have to bullsh*§t~

you,” he said. .
Post-lecture‘, the couple answers
audience questions. Behrendt says
they span from repetitive ques-
tions by people who expect their

answers to be different from ev-
eryone else to bizarre sexual cu-

couple’s favorite part of the show,

, when people,  ask whatever is

on their mind;
“Everything, I mean literally.
My boyfriend’s in prison  [The

A answer would be,] ‘Raise the bar,”’

he said.  : - b
V The two aren’t particularly
keen on takingcredit for changing

_people’s circumstances. Behrendt
. makes it clear that while he and
I Ruotola are happy to share their

knowledge to enlighten frustrated

; A daters, people are the ones chang- A

ing their ownllove lives.
“We didn’t do sh*t, youknow. I

was at my house when you did this-

You bought the book, you solved
the problem, you ﬁxed this,” he
said. I

A lot of what the couple talks
about is based off personal dat-
ing mishaps and mistakes, so it’s

natural to wonder if their initial .
.mee_ting went offwithout a hitch.

“We had a couple of meetings,
actually. We met at a party at my
house, which she doesn’t remem-
ber. Then I met herat a comedy

music festival in Seattle, and she
sort of didn’t really remember that,

’ either.”Th‘e"n‘, thethird time, ‘I met ‘

her while she was getting her hair

done. The third time I’forced her

to remember me,” hesaid.
Behrendt said the couple took
their time in developing a serious

relationship. They had both had .

their fair share of troubles and
wanted to work on their relation-
ship, particularly because, as far
as Behrendt was concerned, he
knew fairly quickly that she was
“the one.”

“The problem with love is that
if we don’t know that it can be bet-
ter, we stay in things because we
ﬁgure this is as good as it gets, this
is what we deserve. But in other
areas, we wouldn’t be so easy to
settle,” he said.

So what’s the golden rule of dat-
ing according to Behrendt?

“Don’t compromise yourself.
The second you start spending less
time with your friends, spending
less time with your jobs, spending
less time with all the things you’re

here to do. As soon as you start '

shape-shifting yourself, you’re
done,” he said.

Stah|:Thanks for the compliment, but don’t always expect one back.

“Coco Before Chanel”

Starring: Audrey Tautou, Benoit Poelvoorde,
Alessandro N ivola, Marie Gillain, Emmanuelle
Devos

Director: Anne Fontain

Studio: Sony Pictures Classics

Grade: B-

Though “Coco Before Chanel” lacks the sub-
stance needed to give justice to fashion mogul
Coco Chanel’s story, it serves the audience by of-
fering a look into her life before the fame and
fashion.

A Theﬁlm chronicles Gabrielle “Coco” Chanels
(Audrey Tautou) journey from her years in an
orphanage‘ and as a seamstress in a small town
in Western France until she perfected her craft
and created afashion empire. ‘

The director’s portrayal of Chanel suggests
that she was an assertive young woman who put
up a front to give outsiders the impression that
she was a self-reliant, independent woman. Yet,
in reality, Chanel was ﬁ‘agile and often put up a
wall to avoid getting hurt.

The movie succeeds in showing Chanel’s mea-
ger beginnings as a cabaret singer performing
with her sister in a cheap bar that caters to aris-
tocrats and dignitaries pining for a sexual ﬁx. It

is at this bar she meets Etienne Balsan (Benoit
Poelvoorde), the socialite and millionaire who"
transitions from Chanel’s loverto her mentor and
protector throughout the ﬁlm.

After her sister runs offwith a baron and her
dreams of singing professionally die, she carts
her belongings to Balsa.n’s estate outside of Paris

and leads him to believe that she plans to stay? *

only a few days.

Once Balsan realizes she has no intention of
leavingthe estate, hetakes her underhiswingand
eventually introduces her to Arthur “Boy” Capel
(Alessandro N ivola), who becomes her lover. Since
Capel is promised to anotherwoman, Chanel vows
never to marry.

Glimpses of the future designer are shown
throughout the ﬁlm. Chanel makes hats for Bal-
san’s fellow socialites and steals his dress shirts
and ties to fashion outfits for herselfthat appear
to be better suited for riding horses.

The recurring theme in the ﬁlm is the over-
coming of obstacles and going againstthe norm.
Chanel does both by not letting her past deter her
from pursuingher dreams and startingafashion
empire based on simplicity, clean lines, practical-
ity and male-inﬂuenced clothing.

While the movie does a good job of making
the audience understand the circumstances that
might have inﬂuenced Chanel as an individual,
the failure to focus on what precisely led to her
career as a designer takes away from the overall
feel of the ﬁlm.

Gibbs improves after asummer in Auckland

 

Zlhe sophomore guard was a member of the Jamie Dixon—coached Under-19 Team USA in the FIBA World Championships"

_ Ben Duignan
Staﬁ" Writer

As a true freshman last season, Pitt
guard Ashton Gibbs was a solid per-
former coming off the bench. Gibbs
paced all Big East players with a .439
3-point shooting percentage in 2008.
He even earned the nickname “1VIi—
crowave,” after he continuously came

. off the bench to hit 3-pointers.

In 2009, Microwavewillbe expect-
ed to step into a much bigger role.

With the departure of star point
guard Levance Fields, Gibbs will likely
split time at the point with redshirt
freshman Travon Woodall and senior
transfer Chase Adams.

Despite losing Fields, Pitt coach]a-
mie Dixon thinks he has three young
guards who can contribute.

“We lost a great point guard in Le-
Vance Fields,” Dixon said. “We took
[woodall and Gibbs] in the same re-
cruiting class, and we couldn’t be in a

/zbetter position with these two guys.”

While Pitt senior guard Jermaine
Dixon recovers from abroken footthat
willsidelinehimfortheﬁrstpart ofthe
2009 campaign, Gibbs will also likely

see signiﬁcant time at shooting guard
for Pitt.

Even once Dixon returns, which
might be in time for the O’Reilly Auto
Parts CBE Classic Nov. 23, Gibbs should
see signiﬁcant time atboth guard posi-
tions.

“When we getjerrnaine back, those
four guys will be interchangeable,”
Coach Dixon said after Pitt’s Blue- Gold
game Oct. 27. _

With the departure ofFields, along
with Dejuan Blair, SamYoungand Tyrell
Biggs, the Panthers should be a more
guard—oriented team on offense. Be-
cause of this, Gibbs knew he had to el-
evatehis game forthe upcomingseason
and made sure to put inthe extrawork
this summer.

4 “I really worked on my condition-
ing, myball—handli'ngand my shooting,
as well,” Gibbs said. “Hopefully you’ll
see a different Ashton from last year,
andIthinkyouwill.” V

One ofthehigh]ightsofGibb§ sum— I

mer came when he helpedlead the Un-
der-19 USA Basketball Team to a gold
medalinAuckland, Newzealand. Dixon
served as head coach for the team.

“It was big on a conﬁdence level,”
Gibbs said about his time with Team

USA. “Just to know that I can play with
some of the best players in the world, I
thinkthat changed a lot for me.”

The sophomore guardaveraged 9.8
points per game, dished out 20 assists
and led the team in minutes played en
route to Team USA’s 9-0 record at the
FIBA World Championships.

Gibbs hopes he can take what he
learned from his international playing
experience into this season.

“I think I played some of my best
defensethis summerwith Team USA,”
Gibbs said. “I’m going to try to carry
whatlleamed [at theworld champion-
ships] into this season.” 0

Dixon thinks that Gibbs’ time play-
ing for Team USA had a profound im-
pact onhisgame. , A

“I tliinkAshtonleamedalot, Ithink

hegotbetter,”Dixonsaid.“Ithinkyou’ll ‘

The freshman that came off the
bench and provided a spark last year
will be expected to develop into a con-

sistent scoringthreatfor the Panthers ' V I

in2009. _

Asthisseasonunfolds,don’tbesur-
prised if the Microwave burns hotter
than ever.

Ashton Gibbs should see more time at both guard positions this year.

BCS Breakthrough

Pitt’s victory over South Florida
gave the Panthers their ﬁrst 7-1 record
since 1982. Now, after a bye week,
Pittis13th in the Bowl Championship

rréseries rankings. ‘

This is the highest the Panthers
have ever been in the computer-
generated ratings since the BCS was
established in 1998. _

Cincinnati remains the highest

_, rated Big East team, at No. 5 iii the

'19

BCS withan8—0 record. South Florida
is the other Big East representative,
ﬁlling the 25th slot.

The rankings are insigniﬁcant
for the Panthers at this point in the
season. With seven undefeated teams

‘ “ranked ahead ofPitt, an at-large birth

in a BCS bowl game seems unlikely.
The only deﬁnite path to playing
in aBCS game is winningthe Big East

Conference title and receiving an au-
tomatic bid.

Pitt controls its own destiny in
that regard with three conference
games, including a visit from unde-

feated Cincinnati remaining on the ‘

schedule.

Holley Trolley

With Elijah Fields battlinganarikle
injury, redshirtfreshmanjarred Hol-
ley has taken over starting duties as
strong safety. However, as the season
continues, Holley mightremaininthe
lineup because of his performance,

j regardless of injuries.

Coming into training camp this
summer, Holleywas expected to com-
pete for playing time at cornerback.
But after Andrew Taglianetti’s torn
ACL revealed a lack of depth at the
safety position, Holley was moved
to ﬁll the void.

Head coach Dave Wannstedt has
been pleasedwith the way Holleyhas

handled beingthrown into signiﬁcant ‘

game situations.

“[Holley] is aveiy talented, smart
individual,” Wannstedt said. “No one
ever expected him to play this much
as a redshirt freshman and  no one
expected him to play at safety.

“He’s done a great job of making

the transition, and that’s a real bright H

spot for us in the ﬁiture.”

Pitt has been ﬁnding ways to get
both Holley and Fields into the game
simultaneously. Recently, Fields has

, been ﬁlling in as linebacker and get-

ting repetitions within Pitt’s nickel
package. '
During his Monday press con-
ference, Wannstedt noted that the
nickel package could be something
the Panthers employ, in some fashion,
throughout the rest of the season. '
“It depends on personnel groups.
If we getthree wide receivers, as phys-
ical as [Fields] is, we have no problem
playingwith two linebackers and him
in the game,” Wannstedt said.
One Less to Cover . g
The task of stoppingthe Big East’s

second—worst scoring offense just be-
came a little easier for the Panthers.

News surfaced on Monday that
Syracuse wide receiver Mike Williams

‘ has quit the football team. Williams

was suspended for the Orange’s Oct.

24 game against Akron but returned ,
A to play against Cincinnati the follow-

ing week.

While Syracuse (3-5, 0-3) has V

struggled to generate points all sea-
son, one of their lone bright spots
was Williams. A senior from Buffalo,
N.Y, Williams is the Big East’s leading
receiver with 49 receptions for 746
yards and six touchdowns this year.
Prior to leavingthe team, Williams

was a serni-ﬁnalist for the Biletnikoff .

Award, which is given to the nation’s
best receiver, and was an apparent
NFL Draft prospect.

In Williams’ place, the Orange
will turn to Donte Davis and Marcus
Sales, who have combined this year
for 32 receptions, 339 yards and four
touchdowns.

A game in honor of Western civilization ’s best broadcaster

Earlier in the week, watching NBA action got a lot worse as broadcaster Bill Walton retired because of back problems

  

Adam Littman
Assistant Sports Editor

We’re not even two weeks into, the NBA sea-
son, and the league has already suffered a
loss more damaging than if LeBron_]ames or
Kobe Bryant were to suffer a season—ending
injury.

On Monday, broadcaster Bill Walton re-
tired because of back problems, making this
the second time in his career he’s retired too
early because of an injury. As a player, the
6-foot-11 Walton was unlike most other big
men in the league, with tremendous ability to
pass and run the court. Unfortunately, Walton
was bothered by recurring foot injuries and
played in just 468 games during his 10-year
career. V V

Starting in 1990, Walton became abroad-
caster for NBC and the Clippers and then
from 2002 until last year with ABC. Walton
was known for making hilariously exagger-
ated comments while announcing. He would
also talk frequently about the Grateful Dead
and claims he’s seen more than 650 Dead
concerts.

In honor of Walton’s illustrious career, I
thought we could play a game called “Is That

I give you a quote and you need to say whether
it was actually said on air by Walton. Enjoy.

Quote 1: “racy McGrady is doing things
we’ve never seen from anybody — from any
planet!”

‘Quote 2: “When I think of Boris Diaw, I
think of Beethoven in the age of the Roman-
tics.” ” '

Quote 3: ‘.‘The New York Knicks are the
best-run franchise in the history of Western
civilization.”

Quote 4: “Yesterday, we celebrated Sir
Isaac Newton’s discovery of gravity. Today,
Fabricio Oberto is defying it.”

Quote 5: “Cuttino Mobley has just made
theworst pass attempt in the history of this
proud Houston Rockets franchise.”

Quote 6: “What a pathetic performance by
this sad human being. This is a disgrace to the
game of basketball and to the NBA.”

Quote 7: “You look at Vladimir Rad-
manovic, this guy is cut from stone. As if
Michelangelo was reading and a lightning
bolt ﬂashed before him.”

Quote 8: “John Stockton is one of the true
marvels, not just of basketball, or in America,
but in the history of Western civilization.”

Quote 9: “Come on, that was no foul! It may
be a violation of all the basic rules of human
decency, but it’s not a foul.”

Quote 10: “If Eric Piatkowski continues

playing at this level, he’s going to replacejerry
West on the NBA logo.”

And now onto the answers:

Quote 1: That is most certainly a real quote
from Walton’. Perhaps it was all those Dead
shows,,but Walton doesn’t seem to realize the
NBA game has yet to go galactic. In fact, in the
league’s history, only one player has ever come
from another planet. And Sam Cassell, while
a very good player, had a much different skill
set than McGrady.

Quote 2: Once again, that is an actual quote '

from Walton. He wastalking about how Diaw
has transformed the Suns franchise, how
much of a classical human being Diaw is and
how it had been a little more than 300 years
since Beethoven’s “Symphony No. 3” came
out. Oddly enough, Walton didn’-t bring up
how Diaw oftentimes stops playing if he no-
tices the crowd talking among themselves.

. "Quote 3: While Walton does like to mention
Western civilization, not even he has smoked
enough pot to say something so outlandish.

Quote 4: Another actual Walton quote.
This one came after a rather impressive dunk
by Oberto, then on the Spurs and now a mem-
ber of, ﬁttingly enough, the Wizards.

Quote 5: Nope. This one was a trick. I com-

‘ bined two great Walton quotes. One quote was

about an errant Tony Parker pass being the
worst pass attempt in the history of the Spurs,

ﬂ
and the other one is about Robert Horry tak-
ing the two worst shot attempts in the proud
history of the Rockets.

Quote 6: That was said by Walton in ref-
erence to a lackluster performance by Larry
Johnson. This one had to sting ifjohnson ever
ended_up hearing it. On the plus side, John!“
son was nicknamed “Grandmama,” partially
because he dressed up like an old woman in
a sneaker commercial, but also because he
always kept a bowl of sucking candy at his
locker.

Quote 7: Walton clearly liked his history,
as this is another quote from the man. Fun
Fact: Radmanovic is literally cut from stone,
limestone to be completely accurate. V

Quote 8: I’m not sure what led Walton to
say this, but he most certainly‘ did. My guess
is he said it about Stockton’s ability to appear
so conﬁdent on the court while wearing shorts"
that somehow ended above his waistline.

Quote 9: Another winner from Walton.

Quote 10: Walton said this one after the
frequent benchwarmer, who averaged 7.5
points a game in his 14-year career, hit a few
consecutive shots one game.

Well that’s it. Hope you did well. One quick
suggestion: Watch all NBA games on mute
this year as another way to pay tribute to the
greatest broadcaster in the history of Western
civilization.
