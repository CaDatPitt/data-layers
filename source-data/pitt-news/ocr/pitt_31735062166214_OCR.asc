‘Service To Give

Prohlems’—Heath

By LENORE BALSAM

' Tucked in a corner behind

the scaffolding, wood shav-
ings, paper covered floors, and
the other signs of remodeling‘
at the Student Union Build-
ing, is the office of Dr. S. Roy

Heath, Director of the Counseling
“ Service.

Dr. Heathfa distinguished gen-

tleman, has furnished the room
quite comfortably and ﬁlled it
with the delightful aroma of pipe
'—_,t0bacco.

He is a graduate of Princeton,

class of 1939. After Princeton, he
went to the University of Penn-
sylvania to further his study in
clinical psychology.

Psychology As Understanding
Brieﬂy, Dr. Heath explained that

clinical psychology is the under-
standing of individual personal-
ities, their aptitudes, faults, and

preferences,

dealing anywhere

from the normal to the abnormal.

His professional training as a
phychologist was interrupted by
the Army, and because of his
experience, he was sent to Fort
Meade as a psychologist ,spe-
cializing in disciplinary. prob-
lems. After completing this obli-
gation to Uncle Sam, Dr. Heath
returned to Penn to receive his
doctorate. .

An interesting research program

called Dr. Heath back to Princeton
in 1950. He became the head of a
project in the area of student de-
velopment, which was ﬁnanced by
a Carnegie Foundation Grant. In
this program, Dr. Heath worked
directly with thirty-six students in
the class of ’54.

The results of this project be-
came known; and about this

came to Pitt and has set up tem-
porary ofﬁces in 102 «Student Un-
ion. By June, his offices are to be
gnoved to the fourth ﬂoor which
the Placement Bureau will also
occupy.

Although Dr. Heath is limited
by space and lack of assistants
now, by the fall semester he
hopes to have a staff of assist-
ants, all Ph.Ds, to work with the,
students. He argues that one of

Edward H. Berg received his B.S. Ch. E. from Cornell in 1944
and served as an Engineering Oﬁicer on destroyer duty until
1946. Since coming with Du Pont, he has worked at New Jersey

Using technical graduates who came with Du Pont
in 1949 as a base, we found these men averaged 1.7
transfers of location in 7 years. We frequently shift
men from one assignment to another at the same loca-
tion, to broaden them professionally. But it’s interest-
ing to note that 38%‘ of those surveyed had not
changed their location of employment at all.

Changes of work location depend a little on the
type of work a man enters. For instance, there are

they invariably represent opportunity for further pro-

  E State of the Union

, If any student has a question to ask about the. Student
Union tomorrow is the time. On this subject important to
every University member, Dr. Charles H. Peake, Assistant
Chancellor in charge of ‘Student Affairs, will talk at 2:30

' p.m. in the Stephen Foster Memorial Auditorium. He will

speak and show slides pf the floor plan of the Schenley Hotel
and its relation to the University. The slides are planned to
demonstrate the use of the Union and the placement of var-
ious activities’ meeting rooms. ,

“It is anticipated that a large portion of student or-
ganizations will be moved in September,” said Jack Hard-
man, Associate Dean of Men. No one need grumble about
the facilities of the Student Union in September if he misses
this meeting. ,

To be informed about designs for decades to come, stu-
dents should be in the Stephen Foster Memorial tomorrow
for Dr. Peake’s explanation.

People of the Year it

We can talk all day about the courage of the Hun-
garian freedom—ﬁghters, but talk doesn’t clothe naked
bodies or shoeless feet. _

From knitted afghans to men’s shoes, the YM-YWCA is
accepting clothes for Hungarian refugees. For those people
“of the year,” no less help could be given.

All types of men’s, women’s and children’s clothing ex-
cept women’s shoes are needed and willbe received at 812

C1. Although this week is the main clothing drive, contri-'

butions may be made through January, as packages won’t
be sent until the end of the month.

The campaign is being conducted through the American
Friends Service Committee in Philadelphia.

So far the greatest response for the clothing drive has

been by faculty members.

This is surprising, considering all the strong words by
students supporting drives for sending money -to Hungarian
students and by students interested in securing Hungarian
students in the United States to speak at various organi-
zations’ meetings.

Here is a worthy request that can be met easily and
abundantly. Every student should respond.

A Job   or Motivating . . .

     

0 d o C o 1- o .
By Irv Jacobs

It being agreed that the U.N. is alarmingly in-
effective due to nationalistic roadblocks, perhaps
the greatest hope for increased U.N. effectiveness
lies in the motivation of the world’s ordinary citi-
zens. : The necessary go-signal for boosting U.N.
power must come from a united world opinion_

An important task, then of this generation is
the enlightenment of the world’s
peoples toward realization of
what a boon for peace the U.N.
can be. Aware of this job, cer-
tain c o n c e r n e d individuals
throughout the world have right-
ly taken as their private duty to
accomplish. In some forty coun-
tries, their eﬂorts are being di-
rected through member groups
of . the World Movement for
World Federal Government.
Grass Root Folk

The essential project lying ahead of this inter-
national organization is the reversal of the preva-
lent public apathy towa-rd problems outside of local
interest. By getting grass—root folk informed of
the course of world happenings and its effect on
them, the World Federalists are stimulating people
to appreciate the current tense world atmosphere
and the necessity for world cooperation if man-
kind is to survive. In the process, they. are en-
couraging tolerance through an objective presen-
tation of the problems and peoples of various lands.

The organization, which is in effect a powerful
lobby for strengthening the U.N., has had a tre-
mendous growth in the past ten years. Here in the
U.S., leaders in the United, World Federalists have
grown to include such eminent names as Norman
Cousins, Oscar Hammerstein, and Walter Reuther.

Its programs include the dissemination of in-
formation, the providing of informed speakers, and
the planning of public programs to stimulate dis-

interest in the game. Fraternity

had never seen Pitt play were
up in the smoke-and-dust-ﬁlled

Then, too, a Pitt—West Virginia

Discover the difference between
“just smoking”...and Camels!

Taste the difference I No fads,
frills, or fancy stuff —- simply
the finest taste in smoking.
Camels are rich, full-ﬂavored,
and deeply satisfying.

Feel the difference! The ex-
clusive Camel blend of quality
tobaccos is unequalled for

smooth smoking. Camels never

let you down.

 

Enjoy the difference! More
people smoke Camels, year
after year, than any other
cigarette of any kind. Try

Against Army; Sprint Stars Return

Despite the departure from
the Pitt track scene of Arnie
Sowell, the best all-around
track star here in over a de-
cade, the Blue and Gold squad
is looking forward to its best
indoor season in many years. A
well-balanced team seems to be
the answer to the problem that has
plagued Coach Carl Olson in the
last few years when he had to
depend on one
or two men to
carry the load.

R e t u r n i n g

An outstanding sophomore

prospectrin Jay Moody will give
the Panthers 3. strong one-two
punch in the sprints. Moody is
also an excellent low hurdler
and will team with Paul Thrash,
last year’s leading hurdler, and
Bob Russell. another sophomore
for whom Coach Olson has high
hopes, in this event. Thrash and
Russell will be carrying the
Panther hopes in the high hur-
dles also.

In the middle ‘distances the
Blue and Gold has several return-
ing lettermen who are expected to
lead the team in this department.
Among the familiar faces will be
Ed Saunders, Thrash and Charles

_ Heﬂin.

In past years the Panthers have
been relatively weak in the longer
distances and‘ the weight events.
Vince Timon, Panther sophomore,
who broke Wes Sant_ee’s cross-
country record this past season
will set the pace in the long runs.
Coach Olson says, “Timon should
break the University record in the
two-mile run and cut his time to
close to 9:10 before ‘the season
ends.” Wendell Harford, a return-

Gymnasts Seek
Second Straight

The Panther gymnasts,‘ fresh

from a 69-26 victory over West

Chester State Teachers, are pre-
paring for a rugged match at Syra-
cuse on Saturday. The Orangemen
have a team comparable to Pitt’s,
according to Coach Neiger, and the
Panthers are out to avenge a
three-point loss of last season.
The local acrobats swept all six

‘ events against the Teachers as

Jim Mulvihill and sophomore Dave
Hirst each won two events.
“Mulvihill turned in the best
performance of the match on the
high bar,” Neiger observed.
“You also have to give Hirst
credit in his ﬁrst varsity match
and Tom Darling did well con-
sidering he had bursitis.”
Mulvihill annexed the side horse
and high bar events, .and Hirst
took tumbling and ﬂying rings.
Dave Ruber scrambled up the rope
in a good 4.4 seconds in winning
that event. Jack Hammond starred
on theparallel bars. The Blue and
Gold did so well that every local
performer broke into the scoring
column.
Following Syracuse, the acrobats
will take on Lock Haven, Jan. 26,

on the opposition’s home grounds.

TABLE TENNIS

Anyone interested in joining
the Pitt Table Tennis Team is

Bill Smith will have to carry
a double load this season in the
pole vault and the broad jump
with Panther chances in these
events depending greatly on his
performance. Olson says, “Smith
will probably do 14 feet in the
vault this year. This should be
good enough to place him among
the nation’s leading vaulters.”
Returning in the weight events
will be Corny Salvaterra, a senior
from whom much is ' expected.
Last year a broken leg sustained
in spring football practice kept
S a I v a t e r r a from competing in
track, but this year with no other

sport on his mind, he should give.

the thinclads a big lift in events
that were the sore spot on the

team last year. Coach Olson feels”

that Salvaterra will be throwing
the javelin over 200 feet consist-
ently.

Salvaterra is expected to heave
the shot over 50 feet. Thus he
seems likely to be the top man in
this event, also, with Larry Och
giving him strong support. Wesley
King, John Krock and Art Gob
are the standouts in the discus
throw.

Makes All-America Soccer Team

Bressanelli Given Honor

Jerry Bressanelli, inside left of
the Panther soccer team, has been
named to the All-American soccer
squad. In being selected as one
of the top booters in the country,
Bressanelli, a junior, is the ﬁrst
Panther to receive this honor.

Leo Bemis, coach of the Panther
booters, thinks that Bressanelli is
well deserving of All-American
recognition. “Jerry was our
strength behind what offense we
had this past year,” Bemis com-
mented. “He sacriﬁced his scoring
for setting up and leading the
inexperienced line. He did the
passing, ball—handling and man-
euvering to give the others a
chance to score.”

Bressanelli tallied only two

goals the entire season, but
coaches and referees——who do
the voting for the All-America
team—thought so much of his
teamwork that only one referee
out of the ten-game schedule
failed to vote for him.

Since Bressanelli is only a -jun-
ior, he will be back next season
to ﬁght for a higher position on
the much-cherished squad. And
Bemis feels that he will do just
that. He says, “I think that with
the experience the others have
gained Bressanelli will come into
his own as a scorer, and then the
fans will get a chance to see his
all-around ability. He should deﬁn-
itely get wider recognition next
year.” '

What young people are doing at General Electric

Young engineer
pioneers new ways
to use x-ray

A new X-ray inspection system which intensi-
ﬁes an x-ray image morethan 10,000 times in
brightness and transmits it to a conventional
TV screen’ has been developed recently by
General Electric. When perfected, it may en-
able medical specialists to perform “long-dis
tance” diagnosis on patients in remote areas.
One of the principal men who developedx-ray
television —— called TVX for short + lS‘Dl’. John
E. Jacobs, Manager of the Advanced Develop-
ment Laboratory of General Electric’s X-Ray
Department in l\/lilwaukee, Wisconsin.

Jacobs’ Work is Important, Responsible

As an electronics specialist, Dr. Jacobs’ work
in the past has been devoted to the study of
photoconductors-substances whose properties
change under the inﬂuence of radiation — and
the use of x-ray in industrial inspection. This
in turn led to his development of the x-ray-
sensitive camera tube used in TVX.

His present administrative duties with the
Advanced Development Lab allow him more
time for teaching others what he has learned.
He now teaches the second-year graduate course
at Northwestern in vacuum-tube networks, and
has recently been named McKay Visiting Pro-
fessor for 1957 by the University of California
at Berkeley, where he will give a two-week
series of lectures on photoconduction.

27,000 college ﬁraduates at General Electric

Since his youth, when he was a licensed radio
“ham,” John Jacobs has been devoted to the
study of electricity and electronics. Like each
of our 27,000 college graduates, he is being
given the chance to grow and realize his full
potential. F or General Electric has long be-
lieved this: when fresh young minds are given
the freedom to develop, everybody beneﬁts -
thc individual, the Company, and ‘the country.

DR. JOHN E. JACOBS joined General Elec-
tric full time in 1950, after receiving his
BS. in electrical engineering in ’47, his
M.S. in ’48, and his Pli.D..in ’50, all at
Northwestern Univ. He served in the Navy
in World War II, and worked part time
at General Electric while in college.
