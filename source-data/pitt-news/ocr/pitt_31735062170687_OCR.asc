 Counciglg Discusses Faculty Activities to be Evaluated

Work-Load ‘Report Required

New Course Proposals
i ’ ~ by LOIS ELDER ‘
A request to make CAS 25, Urban ‘Field Placement. mandatory

’ credit/no entry, the creation of a Cultural Environment Program, the

possibility of creating a Film Major, and a course proposal for Black
Studies, were discussed at the CAS Council meeting Friday. Dr. Jerome
Schneewind, Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences, presided at the
meeting. ' - _

David Bramhall, Professor of Economics, requested that the
course he teaches, “Urban Field Placement,” be listed exclusively as
a credit/no entry course. His request was voted on and passed.

In a written proposal to the Council, dated-August 14, 1972, Bram-
hall said, “As with all courses in which grading is not handled in the
traditional way, CAS 25 is being invaded by students with little inter-
est in the work of the course, but intense interest in receiving a high
letter grade.” '

At the meeting Bramhall said, “One of the purposes for making it

A credit/no entry is to eliminate students who want to build up their

QPA. CAS 25 should be a learning experience without the p’roblems of
grading.”

A, proposal to create a film‘ major was brought to the attention of
the Council by Schneewind._ The proposal was created by .Attilio Fa-

vorini of the Speech and Theater Arts Department and Donald Gordon‘

from the Fine Arts Department.

Their written propdsal to the Council asked for a study looking into
either “a Self Designed Major with an emphasis on Film or an Auto-
nomous Film Major.”

Three aspects of a study to establish these majors include a ref-
erendum of CAS juniors and seniors with majors in Humanities and
Social Sciences, and the "solicitation of academic ant" financial support
from other local institutions."_ '

The third aspect calls for "a study of the staff credentialsand fi-
nancial assets” at Carnegie Institute’s Film Section and the Pittsburgh
Filmmakers’ Association.

The Council passed the request for Favorini and Gordon to continue
with some form of exploration of student interest, “though not neces-
sarily a referendum,” Schneewind said.

The CAS Council also reviewed a request from Arcadi Nebolsine.

’ Professor of Slavic Languages and‘ Literatures, for the creation of a

Cultural,Environment Program, in which students could be granted a
certificate for study in the program. > ‘ »

In his written proposal, Nebolsine said a program 6r this sort
“would co-ordinate courses being given in various departments that
promote and train students for action in preserving and maximizing ar-
tistic landscapes and the cultural values they represent.” »

In the program the student could do field work and “receive aca-

demic credit for work in protecting and developing the cultural en-

vironment,” Nebolsine said. I

The proposal was unanimously voted for.

The last item discussed was a proposal for a Black Studies course.
"Introduction to the Black Experience.” which is designed as a semi-
nar. _
Schneewind proposed the extensive discussion on it be postponed

and reviewed at a future meeting of the Council because Charles Frye.
the instructor whose proposal this was. was not present.

At their regular senate meet-
ing the faculty discussed their re-
actions to the ‘amendments tacked
onto the 1972-73 Commonwealth
appropriation which requires all
University faculty to report on
their work-related activities.

Commonlylknown as the Snyder I

Amendments, they require the
University to provide “for each
term of the fiscal year 1972-73 an

analysis of the average weekly

work load of each full-time fac-
filty member,identified by school,
department and title.”

According to Provost Rhoten
Smith _earlier versions of the
amendment designated, among
other things, that appropriations
to the University would be re-
duced in the proportion to the
number of faculty teaching less
than 12 hours, and that these re-
quirements were “in a form that
was devastating in the least.”

He added that “we do other
things than stand in front of the
class lecturin_g. We do other
things that are essential to the
community."

With the new reporting proce-
dures that have been worked out.

Credit iGiven for
Courses by Mail

by ROB OBENREDER

Mail-order courses are now be-
ing offered by the School of Gen-
eral Studies‘~(SGS) in an attempt
to . accommodate students who

- cannot participate in on-campus
classes. 1
The University External Studies
Program (UESP), now in its sec-
6nd term of operation. offers un-
dergraduateand graduate courses
that can be taken for credit to-
wards a degree. Presently, 10
courses have been developed by
the SGS in cooperation with the
Learning and Research Develop-
ment Center (LRDC), eight ‘of
which are being given this term.

“I think this is where the fu-
ture of adult higher education
lies,” said Dr- J. Steele Gow,
Dean of SGS. “People find it in-
creasingly harder to find time to
attend on-campus courses. Since
most adults have a good idea of
what they want to study, this type
of curriculum is practical.”

"The students must be_strong-
ly motivated in this type of in-
struction, since there is little re-
inforcement from fellow students
and faculty. As the courses are
designed. they are not a good way
to meet the needs of the marginal
student."

This term ‘200 students have
_registered for UESP courses. al-
though Gow hopes the number of
students will increase in the fu-

ture. "We have not advertisedias A

much as possible because of'the
.ti_rne‘factor."

by MICHAEL CL-INTON L 

The Student.Government Elections Committee ruled last night that‘
the election of Rege Kaufmann as Student Government pre'sident,.b

Five University students had contested the election’s outcome dull
to what they felt were improper methods of petitioning on Kaufman’_s~
part. ’ A I A

300 signatures of full-time undergraduates mustibe obtained before _

Medical Aid for Indochina.
an organization that sends health
goods to the people of Southeast
Asia. has recently founded a lo-
cal office in the Pittsburgh area.
The mission of Medical Aid for
Indochina (MAI) is to collect
donations from the American peo-
ple, use the money to. purchase
medical supplies needed in
Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia.
and send the supplies to the vic-
tims of the war in Indochina.

Sports were covered with the
precision that every sports buff
is familiar with.- Two co-announc-
ers carefully described and inter-
preted-the action, with the help,
of course, of instant replays. The
action, in this case, was the “In-
ternational Sex Games,” which

were conveniently interrupted by .

Commercials came as frequent-
ly. as we are all too familiar with.
and even advertised the same pro-
ducts. Fortunately, the sales slo-
garis had been rewritten.‘ The
Ford LTD was_ filmed with a wide
angle lens and advertised as "the
car that supports the illusion that
you are important, built for your
ego.”

In another commercial, Union
Carbide was renamed “Uranus,”
and everyone watched as a brown

-“Medical Aid for Indochina,”
reads one of the organization’s
pamphlets, “is dedicated to the
idea that the people of Indo-
china are not our enemies. Con-
cerned Americans have the right
and responsibility to replace
medical facilities damaged by
our nation’s- aircraft and to as-
sist in other medical needs re-
lated‘ to the war.”

MAI has recently established
a special emergency relief fund
for the restoration of Bach Mai

  Help lWor Victims  

Hospital, a major medical cen-
ter in Hanoi that was completely

destroyed by the bombs of
U.S. B-52s on December .19
and 22, 1972. The nationwide

goal for the fund is $3 million;
in the first two weeks of the
fund. $450,000 was collected.
$7,500 of that total in Pittsburgh.
MAI is starting a city-widerdoor—

attendance was at the noon show
on Friday, when the Venetian '

date “about 180 people.”

‘ New York. Excerpts from it first

appeared in a program called

‘According to Dillon, there is a
more recent film called “Groove

Work Report

(Continued from Page 1)

Several faculty members ob-
jected to the resolution, pointing
out that this type of response‘
would probably create hard feel-
ings between the legislature and
the University. " '

Thomas Checkley suggested I
that those individuals who felt
strongly /about the amendments -
could write as individuals to
members of the legislature. but
torespond as a group would only
present a threat to the legislature
and make it more difficult to get
rid of the amendment.

Dr. Edison Montgomery made
a motion that the resolution be
tabled and the motion was passed
by an overwhelming majority.

In other activity Stanley Shos-
tak presented a resolution to pro-

’ téct the rights of individual fac-

ulty members in relation to ten-
ure procedures. The resolution
stated, “The senate advises the
Provost not to authorize funds
for the hiring of replacements for
individuals who still have an un-
resolved grievance.” —

Discussion was held on the un--
derlying consequences this reso-
lution presented and it was sug-
gested that the " resolution be

extensive restoration will be in
order.

Provance does not believe the
U.S. government will quickly
undertake a program of medical
assistance to all the Indochinese
people. “I do not anticipate a
moral debt to be felt on our gov-
ernment’s part. We‘ have to gain
Congressional and popular sup-
port for our cause," Provance
said.

Besides the local office. MAI
offices exist in six other cities
across the country: Minneapolis.

Philadelphia, New York. Los
Angeles, and San Francisco, with
the national headquarters in

Cambridge, Mass.

All the money collected na-
tionwide is sent‘ to Cambridge
where the suppliesare purchas-
ed according to orders sent from
Indochinese health officials. The
supplies are... shipped via air
transport through Moscow, Pe-
king or Hong Kong to the Red:
Cross Society in Hanoi and from
there tothe Red Cross Societies
of the Provisional Revolutionary
Government of South Vietnam,
the United Front in Cambodia,
and the Pathet Lao in Laos..

Because these are all political
organs of the communist move-
ment in those countries this pat-
tern of distribution avails the
supplies to only those people who
are in areas under communist
control. Whenasked‘ why MAI
does not send supplies to the areas
‘under control of the U.S. sup-
ported governments (Saigon.
Phnom-Penh, et al), Provance said
those governments are corrupt
and explained that they sell the
supplies to professional doctors or
to the military for war supplies.
An! MAI pamphlet added, "the
Thieu regime has no effective
health delivery system to get what
little is left (after corruption) to

Donations to the Red Cross
Societies of Indochina have been
in the following forms:

Medicines——quinine. synthetic anti-
malarial drugs. tranquilizers.

opthalmic preparations, anti-bio-

tics. anti—tuberculosis drugs. and

polio vaccine; Surgical supplies-
surgical instruments, antiseptics,

canisters, oxygen respirators
and regulators, heart stimulator-
fibrillator, cardiac pacemakers
and accessories, and bedside
monitoring systems; and Litera-
ture—medical texts and journals,
medical and scientific manuals.

The MAI was founded in’ the
fall of 1971 by a number of “doc-
tors, nurses, surgeons, anti-war
activists, clergy and otherpro-
fessional and concerned persons.”
The organization came into exist-
ence after some of the founders
had visited Paris and Hanoi to
meet with the leaders of North
Vietnam and discuss their medi-
cal needs. ‘

' An MAI pamphlet describes
the Medical Aid for Indochina
as “both a political organization
and a humanitarian service. We
try to keep to the strongest anti-
war. anti—Nixon thrust as possible.
Our purposes are to oppose the
war and the present administra-
tion’s policies and to raise money
to buy medical supplies."

Outlook at “Cautious Optimism"

Skeptical Reactions to Peace

by JAMIE KIRKWOOD
News Editor

Days after the announcement
of an intricate peace accord end-
ing America’s longest war. organ-
izations tied to the war remained
skeptical. Reactions were reserved
and cautious.

Anti-war groups that have cam-
paigned against the war explained
the new focuses and objectives of
their organizations now that an
announcement of peace has
been issued.

Anne Adams of the Indochina
Peace Campaign said, “You can
describe our outlook as one of

-cautious optimism.”

“I anticipate that we will con-
tinue to maintain a vigilance.
We’re still concerned about the
10,000 American advisors in Viet-
nam. many of whom seem to be
under the CIA.

“The heavy bombardment of
Hanoi could very well be read
as a warning to Hanoi that we

would intervene anytime we
wanted to.
“What he (the President)

demonstrated is that he will not
be inhibited by public opinion

or even world opinion—the Presi- ’

dent...will do what he wants to
do,” Adams said.

“We will continue efforts of
education and dissemination of
materials. Though there is
certainly hope. we aren’t en-
tirely out of the woods yet,"
Adams stated.

ciety (SDS) spokesman Matt

as the war is concerned, we think
the cease fire is not going to last
for long.

“The Thieu regime is still
around. The probability is great
that there will be more political
prisoners."

As for the focus of the organi-
zation since the announcement
Schneirov said, “The SDS really
hasn’t'been concentrating on the
war for about two years. We felt
it was related to other issues—_
mainly racism.” ‘

Concentrating on campaigning

against racism and sexism, Schneir-

ov saw the main problem as “the
disunity between white and
blacks.” ~

Schneirov summarized, “As far
as the organization carrying on
now, we’re not going to concen-
trate on war issues. We might

, concentrate on the screwing of

the American people.”

The organization most personally
involved in the war is Vietnam
Veterans.

Veterans at Pitt Director George

Sell said the peace announcement
has “left me very skeptical.”

“It looks as though the war is A 
ending is. 

continuing. What,’s
American involvement.

“If it’s true that the war is "I

over for Americans, then it is our
task to ensure thatthe veterans
be given, not benefits for pay-

ment for risking their lives in ' 
war, but career opportunity be-' 
cause they have been asked to cur- f2ff,_ ;

tail their career development -

to take time out of their lives to  

serve.

“It is generally agreed that this 

war is, at the least,

a mistake,”-
Sell stated. - ~ '

“I’m not interested in’celebr,at-“~
ing the end of the war. We should i_. .;‘;

mark this a period of mourning for

the hundreds of thousands killed’ 

in the mistake.

“We must mourn the mistake; 
and start to rebuild our country’;

as well ‘as the combat zdne.”

Eric Severeid may have perfectly 

summed up public reaction‘ to:
the peace announcement on the
news analysis that followed when;

Yankee Traditions Triumph

“. . .the American people. Your
steadfastness in supporting our in-
sistence on peace with honor has
made peace with honor possible.”

Nixon ran for re-election on just
that premise—“peace with honor."
And the citizens responded with
a landslide of votes. This land-
slide bought Nixon the time to"
complete his plans without early
interference from Congress. It .
enabled him to follow a path that
was. at the time. attackable for its
manifestations in the Gulf of
Tonkin. in the air over North
Vietnam. and at the tables in Par-
is. This path was as narrow as a

‘tightrope and about as perilous.

Saturday. however. it proved to be
the course which may provide
an end to all the killing in Viet-
nam. not just to the U.S. involve-
ment there. The American elec-
torate deserves credit for its
perseverance and ‘confidence.
both of which helped bring this
about.

A part of that electorate for the
first time last year were the mem-
bers of the most aware, conscien-
tious generation of young peo-
ple in American history. It was

-they, with sit-in and morator-
ium, with rhetoric and sweat, who
from Berkeley to Kent to Washing-
ton D.C. made this country ac-
cept settlement as a desirable end
rather than as a degrading fail-
ure. They eliminated from U.S.
options the sickening possibility
of expanding the war to end it.
They opened the eyes and heart
of this nation to the horror and
hell of war. They have earned
an acknowledgement which they
will receive with time, and a sat-
isfaction which they can feel
now. I

Perhaps overlooked in the pas-
sion of the times was the perform-

ance of something which we prize _

greatly. yet at times take for
granted. Something which was
used by millions (and abused by
many on both sides) during the
last eight years. Credit this. the
American system and tradition
of free discussion. with provid-
ing for and at the same time with-

standing the incredible tug-/of-

Letters to the Editor  

Tradition Shafted
Dear Beloved University.

We have been at this school ‘a
combined total of 12 years. Dur-
ingﬂthis time. we have silently
endured many disastrous seasons
of Pitt athletics. We have watch-
ed in horror as the academic stan-
dards have tumbled to an all time
low. We have turned the other
cheek while we have been rob-
bed. beaten. and raped. We have
swallowed cafeteria food with
nary a complaint.

But last Saturday night, proved
to be the final straw. Saturday
night found'our two heroes lend-
ing vocal support to our Univer-
sity Basketball I team. During
half-time, we decided to replen-
ish ourselves with the tradition-
al coke and hotdog. Having pur-
chased the aforementioned items,
we proceeded with due haste to
the mustard sta.nd,;when lo and
behold, after 12 years or maybe

even longer, the old, traditional

Pitt brown mustard, which adorn-
ed our little bun so. often in the
past, had been replaced by com-
mon every-day yellow mustard.

We certainly agree that the
changes are necessary in order
to improve our school. However. I)
change for its own,.sake cannot be
tolerated. We strongly urge the‘
University to re-examine this
clandestine decision. and to ask
itself. in good conscience. wheth-
er such a policy is justified.

Respectfully.

Pitt Progresses

Dear Sirs.

I feel compelled to agree with
Ms. Corky Lapenas who wrote a
letter to the Pitt News. publish-
ed’January 10th. I went -to the
University of Michigan for a year
and thought it was ridiculously
inefficient. Their attempts to pro-
cess routine forms like registra-
tion forms. and their monumental
goof—ups made me laugh. But
compared to this place. they are a
model of efficiency. If there is
anything out of the ordinary about

one's registration. the university ,

will probably screw it up. I sus-
pect there is something drastically
wrong somewhere in the adminis-

tration of this school. perhaps in
the personel office. that results
in incompetent people being
employed at all levels in the uni-
versity (though, of course. not all
the employees at all the levels are
incompetent). A look at man-
agement is in order. although
care should be used in choosing
a means of evaluation—efficiency
reports done by professionals are
often expensive shams.

Mark Iskovitz

Peter Principle

Dear Editor:
Since my freshman year at Pitt.

in 1927. I have witnessed ‘many

changes in -the physical buildup
of the University. TheCathedral
of Learning. the Engineering
Building. the Falk Clinic, the ac-
quisition and the building of
student dorms,~to mention a few.

' However, these changes have
been accomplished by adminis-
trators, consisting of men and
women experienced in _industry:
banking, and many professions.
But, many of these people were
and are strangers: the real rep-
resentatives of the University are
those graduates who participated

‘in athletics, "and became the com-

mon man’s hero. Some of these
were: Charley Hyatt, Doc Carl-

son Sutherland, Skip Goughler,'

Gibby Welsh, Eddie Baker,-Don
Chess Golberg, Hennon Wood-
ruff. The list is endless.

Currently our University is
managed by men of military back-
ground (I'm pleased: the Chan-
cellor, the Athletic Director. and
now the new head football coach
(I hope they retain Mr. Pietro).
All these men I think, have some-
thing in common, especially Mr.
Majors, who related over radio
that he likes Pirogi’s holupchi.
kolbassi, and I’l'l add, borstch. To
me this is the kind of food that

should be on the "training table for‘

all Pitt athletes. Perhaps the
Chancellor could also have it add-
ed to the cafeteria menu.

Congratulations to Pitt, and
with Coach Majors, Pitt’s dim
football light is beginning to glow.

No more “Pitty Pitt," it's "Sic
em Pitt." "

Contest Promotes Concert

While music blared through the
main lobby of the Towers last Fri-
day afternoon and evening, stu-
dent painters decorated the pan-
eled windows, participating in the
Student Government window
painting contest.

This contest, according to Chuck
Braverman of the Student Gov-
ernment Programming Commit-

- tee; was to promote the John Se-

tbastian-McKendree Spring Con-

 

cert to be held on Saturday, Feb.

 

10, at the Syria Mosque.

Each contestant had to include
the name, date, time, and place
of the concert in his painting. The
water base paint used was pro-
vided free by the Student Govern-
ment. ’

Twenty-five paintings were

made and the artists of the five
judged best were each awarded
two free tickets to the Sebastian-
McKendree Spring Concert. Brav-

 

  
 

erman announced the winners:
Rick Goldstein and Mark Venanzi
for posters two and three, Ken
Krenicky and Bill Krotchka for
posters nine and 10, Therese
Brieck and Ann Lamont for pos-
ters two and three, Kathy Kronn
for poster 14, Dan Marra and Car-
ol Bartolinni for posters four and
five.

Towers window painting has be-
comehsomewhat of a tradition at
Pitt, according to Donovan Hugh-
es, associate director of Housing,
who said that the lobby windows
are painted to promote major
campus events such as Homecom-
ing or Greek Week. ’

So far this school year, the lob-
by windows have been painted on
two other occasions: once by the
BAS for Black Week last October
and then a month ago by WPGH to
promote a fund-raising drive for
the benefit’ of Children’s Hospital.

‘Hughes said that . the group‘

which sponsored the window
painting usually has paid to have
the windows cleaned by profes-

. sionals. He reported that cost for

cleaning all the \windows in-the
lobby ranges from $280 to $310,
but the group pays only to have
cleaned those‘ windows that were
painted which usually amounts to
about $50 to $70.

The members of WPGH, after
their A fund-raising marathon. de-
cided to save money and clean the
windows themselves. Hughes ad-
mitted they did the job, but added
that professional cleaners would
not have gotten the floor dirty.
Consequently, future window
paintings, he said, must be clean-

Remuneration Proposal

Passed by SC Board

= by KAREN BRUGIO
,_ Thursday’s night’s Student Gov-
ernment meeting, the last for this
year’s Board, was highlighted by
the passage of an allocation rec-
ommendation which provides re-
muneration for all student leaders.

Theonly activity not included in
the remuneration is the Pitt V
‘News, which signed a contract in‘
December authorizing payment
of salaries to staff members from
their own budget. _ ,

 The remuneration passage came
quickly and without the discussion
that, occurred the preceeding
week, :because opposing board
members Terry Sadler and Dave
Bluey did not attend the meeting.
The allocation provides for $15,-
ll00.'to be divided among student
leaders; the amount which each

7’: receives is based on the difficulty
' of their job and the amount of
= _ time spent at it.

Since this allocation pays lead-
ers from Jan. 1 to June 30, and an- ~

 other allocation pays from July 1

to'Dec. 31, 1973, the Board urged
the Allocations Committee to pay

Sept‘. 1 and if we deam it for the
rest of this year, retroactivity
sq ould be paid.” '

‘D In. the president’s report, Tom
Bailey’ said that the new campus
bJu__s;,_route had been published in

the Pitt News, but would not go
into effect until Feb; 5. Those with

written support for another route '

should submit it to the SG office
before Wednesday.

Bailey urged an investigation
into thefree meals which the
Campus Police enjoy in the cafe-
teria; Terri Weaver commented

that "if that’s their right as Uni- ‘

versity employees,
about the rest?"

The question of "who should
run the Tower's Snack Bar" came
up inl Krenicky‘s report to the
Board. He explained that accord-
ing to their contract Szabo has
rights to the Snack Bar, but found
it unprofitable to run.

If the Snack Bar could be, run
by work/study students, a move
which would eliminate union
wages, it might prove profitable.

In the ‘allocations recommen-

then what

dations, the Eureka and Army‘

ROTC allocations were passed as
recommended; the Men‘s Glee
Club was allocated for its "tour.
but notfor a soloist; Studio The-
atre‘s allocation was increased to

-allow the purchase of a $750 Re-

vox machine, and,.after much dis-
cussion, $1,463 was‘ allocated" to
the Engineering. Student Cabinet
for Engineer’s Week—$860 of the
$1,463 will go towards the
Shamrock Ball.

The incumbent Student Govern-
ment will assumeoffice Thurs-
day at 6 p.m. with a regularly
scheduled meeting at 8 p.m.

lcleos & Figures.
Presents Students’

Artistic Works

by DAVE MAJERNIK

Poems, short stories, photo-
graphs, lithographs, and sketches
grace the 48 pages of the latest
Ideas and Figures, literary maga-
zine. . ‘
Ideas and Figures is published
three times a year (once a term)
by the Student Publications De-

partment. The editorial staff is

made up entirely of students. and
according to co-editor Karl Bal-
dys, any student, or even non-
student, may contribute to the
magazine. The present editorial
staff consists of 12 members, but
there were 25 contributors to the
currentissue. A
Baldys said that this edition of
the magazine will be an “artistic
treat,” despite several setbakcs

"in recent years. These setbacks

included the discontinuation of
full scholarships to the editorand
business manager, and, about a
year ago, a?50 per cent cut in the
budget

The purpose of Ideas and Fig-
ures, said Baldys, is to "get a
good cross section of the stu-
dents’ work.“ He added that the
magazine gives students a chance

- to publish their work and acquire

a reputation. Baldys feels this is
important because it it is difficult
to get into the artistic professions
without experience and a “name."

"We invited anyone to come and
talk with us," said Baldys. "By
talking, we get new ideas and we
feel this is the most constructive
way to direct the magazine."

Co-editor _Jim Rethi explained,

“We have tried to change the di-
rection of this magazine. Welhave
tried to get away from elitism in

the~arts.‘For example, our poetry

tends toward naturalism and pri-
mitivism.” _
This latestissue of Ideas and

Total Cease-Fire?

by FRED s. HOFFMAN
AP Military Writer

WASHINGTON (AP )—The Pen-
tagon today left open the possi-
bility that U.S. warplanes will
bomb the Ho Chi Minh trail and
other military targets in Laos and
Cambodia after the cease-fire
goes into effect Saturday.

Defense Department spokes-
man Jerry W. Friedheim declined
to give a direct answer when ask-
ed about this. referring only to

.Dr. Henry A; Kissingers predic-

tion of a formal cease-fire in Laos_
soon and a halt in fighting in Cam-
bodia as well.

Under repeated questioning,
Friedheim said, “I can’t go be-
yong Dr.’ Kissinger’s words on
those two countries.”

The agreement negotiated by
Kissinger with the North Viet-
namese. says all U.S. military ac-
tion in South Vietnam and against
North Vietnam will end at 7 p.m.

- EST Saturday.

South Vietnames government‘

forces and the Viet Cong .and_

North Vietnamese troops in the
South also will cease firing and
remain .n place at that time.

Friedheim told reporters at a
Pentagonlbriefing that all U.S.
military action against North
Vietnam, including" reconnais-
sance flights, will halt when the

, cease-fire goes into effect.

Although President Nixon halt-
ed all U.S. bombing and piloted
reconnaissance of North Vietnam
a few days before Kissinger ini-

tiated the final agreement with __

the North Vietnames in Paris, the
United States continued to send
camera-bearing, radio-controlled"
drone aircraft over North Viet-
nam. ‘

Friedheim’s statement that
there will be “no reconnaissance"
made it clear that even the drones

, will stop flying over the North.

Firedheim said the flight ban
will be observed “by the U.S. gov-

ernment in toto,” indicating there .

will be no reconnaissance mis-
sions by the Central Intelligence
Agency aswell as the military.

If. as Friedheim implied. U.S.
bombers continue to hit the Ho
Chi Minh trial after the Vietnam
cease-fire goes into effect. the
Nixon administration could find
itself administration could find it-
self involved in a dispute with the
North Vietnamese unless they
were given to understand that this
would happen.

The formal text of the war—end- A

ing agreement dealt mostly with
Vietnam.

In a section on Cambodia and
Laos, the agreement said:

“Foregin countries shall put an

. end to all military activities in

Cambodia and Laos, totally with-

-draw from and refrain from rein— .

troducinginto these two countries
troops, military advisers, and
military personnel, armaments.
munitions and war material.“

But that section specified no

_.,time when this should happen.

the Kurtzmann Room in the Stu-

“Our urgent need,” Anwandter
states, “is to understand our
great potentialities in order to

“The remarkable changes pro-

ing this collection of talent to-
gether. Assembling the musicians
and clearing their appearance on
the album with thier own record
companies was probably a rough
job. Add to this the fact that there
was no rehearsal before the ses-
sions and most of the people in-
volved had never played'"together
before.

I must say that even for a hard-
core‘ country maniac like myself,
this three-record, 37-song set is a
bit too much to digest at one sit-
ting. There’s not one electric in-
strument on the whole record and
this could bother some who,aren’t
used to that much acoustic music
at once. Some songs could have
been ‘dropped, especially . the
songs that feature the Dirt Band
alone, like “Honky .Tonkin” and
“Honky Tonk Blues.” Their sing-
ing is full faked southern twangi-
ness that sounds sick when com-
pared with the rest of the alubm.
“Both Sides Now,” performed by
Scruggs’ son, Randy, as a guitar
solo ends the sixth side. It seems
out of place among “Grand Ole

Opry Song,” “My Walin’ Shoes,”
and “Sailin’ Along to Hawaii._”

But ‘enough negatives. because
the bulk of the music is as rich as
the most fertile southern soil. Roy
Acuff‘s mournful. nasal singing
might be called corny. but it‘s as
emotional as any black bluesman.
He really seems near to tears
when he sings “Aii Hurrd Thugh
Craysh on Thuh Hahaiwayy. But
Ah Didun’t, Hear No-Buddy
p1‘3.\'.V.‘r’.V.Vl H

Earl Scruggs‘ banjo is. as al-
ways. flawless. He reveals a dis-
tinctive guitar style on “You Are
My Flower.“ His recreations of
the old,Flatt and Scruggs songs.
"Flint Hill Special" and “Earl‘s

Breakdown" are predictible. but_

fun to hear again. I must admit a
‘prejudice against Mother May-
belle’s traditional, mournful
style of music, but her material,
"Keep on the Sunny Side” in par-
ticular, is well played. Merle
Travis displays his talent for
songwriting and singing on “Dark
as a Dungeon,” a coal mining
song. Travis was born and raised

Doc Watson sings a rocking ver-
sion of the story/song “Tennes-

Doc’s machine-gun guitar tech-

Jimmy Martin's raw nasal sing-

Several of the backup musicians

only one competitor. The meet is fast outgrowing the Field House,
and although it is an invitational, Banner didn't turn_ anybody down

. this year who askedito come, so in effect, it was an open.

But this is going to have to change. Many of the visiting coaches -

next season. - 1 .

Some of the university division teams entered this yearincluded

_ schools usually have the (diversity to make the competition fierce in all

Pitt-Invitational Is Best Ever

 

MULTI-COLORED uniforms were prevalent throughout the'Pitt Invitational, wherein 25 teams competed.

By JANICE BOCCIGROSSI‘
Associate Sports Editor
The Pitt basketball team seems
to enjoy doing-things the hard
-way — one of those jhard things‘
happens to include going over
nine minutes without scoring/a
field goal and still coming up
with a solid win against a 10-4
Penn State squad. '

_ Last Saturday the’ Panthers
snapped the Nittany Lions‘ five;
game win streak with -a 63-53__vic-

That "togetherne‘s's" that Pitt‘s
head basketball coach Buzz Ridl
was looking for all season seems

like it has finally materialized._

“We’. were together more in
this game than we were in any of
the other games we’ve played this
year,” commented Panther for-
ward Mickey Martin-

The Lions’ coach John Bach also
saw the cohesiveness on the Pitt
team. "Every team that play--
ed Pitt was worried they'd come
together like they have now." he
related. "Pitt played well. They
seemed to have found a lineup
that gives them balance in every
area.” - \

The Panthers jumped off with
the lead early in the game and
steadily "continued "to rack up the ‘
points. Lucius Keese and Billy
Knight dominated most of the ac-
tion for Pitt in the opening 12
minutes and helped the ‘Cats to
overshadow Penn State with -a 20-
9lead. '

At this point, however,/the Pan-
ther guns made an abrupt halt in
action. As hot as the Pitt shooters
were in the (beginning, they did

_an about-face and were ‘ice cold.

    ‘Organization Day’ Marks Affair  

- by VINCE Di NA/RDO
A Sports Editor

This Saturday afternoon, at 1:30 p.m., the Pitt Pan-
thers will host William and Mary at the Field House and
the Rebounders—the basketball booster club—is attempt-
ing to make the otherwise quiet edifice as noisy as. lets
say, the Penn Palestra.

V The Rebounders, with little profit Chevy dealer Bill
Baierl as president, are offering_a keg of beer to the Pitt

. organization that can bring the most fans at the game.

Working through Student Government, all Pitt or-
ganizations (fraternities, The Owl, The Pitt News, the
Glee Club, etc.) will be contacted by Tuesday. If interest-
ed, the group will receive specially marked tickets that
can be freely, distributed among the ‘students. Fans going

, to the game will hand those tickets over as they enter the

—;

3.

game. The tickets will be counted and the winner can
claim the prize at halftime.

M Baierl would like nothing better -than to have frater-
nities, sororities, civil engineers, and bunches of other

organizations flocking to the Field House doors to contest '

the beer and help the Cats to a win.

At the Palestra and at Carmichael Auditorium (North
Carolina) -Bairel has witnessed what a crowd can do for
a basketball team and while student support has,been
faithful this year, Baierl indicated he would like to make
this a special occasion. '

Owls C rush  

by BART MACK

"We would like to get this placed filled up on Satur-
day,“ Baierl related. "We'd like to make ‘Organization
Day‘ an annual affair."

The game will be televised as the Eastern Collegi-
ate Athletic Conference (ECAC) game of the week and the
Rebounders don’t think empty stands make a nice im-
pression on outside viewers.

“Fraternities could bring their standards to wave
.1 like. they do at football games) and other groups could
make signs. If the place is packed, the noise they make
when the team comesout will fantastic. The team will be
ready to go. "

It is no small secret that football is a more popular
collegiate sport than gymnastics. But. sometimes undue

distress is forced upon a minor sport in favor of the big-

gie. .
,Because football coach John Majors had a lot of re-
cruits in the past weekend, the Pitt gymnasts had to fly
to their meetat Temple University on Saturday.

While this seems to be a break for the gymnasts, all
it does is put a strain on their already meager budget.

Ordinarily, the team would have driven to Philadel-
phia, but the University cars were being used by the foot-
ball program. The added expense of flying was not absorb-
ed by the football program, however.

Why should the gymnastic budget be used to pay for

The Duquesne Duke JV's were to have met the Pitt
junior varisty last Saturday night before the Pitti Penn
State game. However, the Little Dukes cancelled out.

The Dukes have lost the services of Dave Harrington
on the varsity squad. Harrington and one of the Duke
frosh have left Duquesne, not meeting the academic stan-
dards. Also, talented Roland Jones, Larry Banasak. and
Dave Mikkenhouse have been moved to the varsity.

4 My heart goes out for the Little Dukes. But, the can- ,’ A‘ _
cellation of the Pitt game might correctly be referred- to .

as “punking out” on any local street corner.

First of all, the Cubs have also lost the services of if 

tw hoopsters, with Keith Starr and Tom Richards move

to t e main team. And they too have had to use the team ’ _-o.
manager to fill in on occasion. — - ' '

The’ fact still remains that Duquesne had enough . 
people to play a game last weekend an_d is willing to play‘ i

the Cubs at the Arena later. But not at the Field House.
My point is that the game should have been played.

Last year, when Pitt had only two recruits and the Little V 
Dukes were going 17-2, Pitt didn’t call to cancel either  » 

of the two games. In fact, they beat Duquesne once.

Is that any way for the number one team of any city’

to act? .

..-f_T<'l‘he Pitt gymnastic squad suf-

j_._fered another setback Saturday,

"being manhandled ‘by Temple,
148.70-78.70. on the winners hard-
wood. The Owlsare the next best
thing to Penn State in the East and
showed it by taking first place in
that event. '

It ‘was another case of lack of
bodies on the Pitt squad. Dick
Pribis came through with Pitt’s
strongest performance. ‘an 8.3 on
the long horse, which earned him
third place. Pribis also had a
7.05 in the floor exercixe while
Christi Gardner gave Pitt some
help with a 7.35 in that depart-
ment. t

'The meet clearly belonged to
‘f's7e"Owls. however,and in particu-

\lar Bob Rice. A transfer student

from Georgia Southern Universi-
ty, Rice delivered a,exceptiona1
all around“ performance with an
outstanding 9.2 in the floor exer-
cise. R ‘

Rice startled t e sparse crowd
with a double back somersault in
his opening and continued to im-
press the judges by finishing with
a double twist somersault. Rice
executed both of the extremely
difficult moves‘ to perfection.

Pitt Coach Iggy Perez was so
impressed with Rice’s perform-
ance that he predicted probable
success for Rice in the Eastern

Regionals. _
“He should do well in the East-
C-- ern’s.” Perez said. “He could

 

break the hold that the Penn State
A gymnasts have on that event."

thers are lucky that Temple was-

«n’t at full strength either. Mel

Hill, one of Temple’s other stand-
outs, did not compete at all.

Besides being undermanned, the .

Pitt gymnasts had their trouble.
Almost all of the Pitt entries on
the sidehorse, . usually Pitt’s
strongest event, sat down which
resulted in their poor showing.

Pitt Coach Warren Neiger also

noted that Temple did not pre-
sent their most experienced squad
when he said, "They weren't us-

challenging meet for them.”

Coach Perez gave his squad '

credit for their performance, put-
ting his finger on the real problem
with this season’s team.

“The guy’s who have been in the
lineup are really trying,” Perez
said. “lt’s a shame we don’t have
more personnel."  ' .

‘ Wrestlers Down WVU Pitt Swimmgrs

by BILL PROUDFOOT

. _ Well, it finally happened. The Panthers got mad.
I They‘-went out after the West Virginia wrestlers
 like someone had been making cracks about their

 mothers. Taking out the frustrations of a 2-4 season

 

1'3 _on_the Mounties, the Cat grapplers scored their<big- A
[ fggest win of the year. 33-6. Wednesday night at 3

[:3 theFie1d House.

I Pitt, however, ran into a tougher night. Friday.
 at Clarion State, and lost to the national power in a
 meet thatwas closer _than the score, 25-14. In both
-;;#meets the Panthers were more aggressive than at
 ‘ any time this season.

. _ West Virginia must still be wondering what hit
_  them. The Mountaineers walked out and won the
, first two matches with aces Jeff Brown and Criag

 

  

1 jHi1legass, sporting a combined 13-2 record, deci- _

{_; Jjsioning Pitt’s Dave DeMarino and Ron Rother in the
 *_‘ 118 and 126 classes,

_ _ ~The Mounties were in for a long night after
 that, as the Panther wrestlers swept ’em off the
’ ymat‘, winning the last eight matches, two by pins.
_ . ‘Match scores of 14-4, 15-1, and 13-0 would seem that
 j ;‘,,-the Panthers were finally going after their men.

   ~- “We were wrestling a little more aggressive-
‘5'_.¥’ l_v.”, said Pitt’s Coach Dave Adams, in what might
 have been the biggest understatement since a ser-
‘ ' geant once told a general named Custer, “There's
 lots of injuns out there, sir." '

W The Cats ate up the hapless West Virginia mat-

 = men.‘ Buzzy Beck scored 15-1 up on Harry Lowe in

the 134 pound class. Ron Selfride and John Buzzato

..-also gained superior decisions. 14-4 and 13-0. at 142
and 150 pounds. * A

score‘ a pin, as he nailed Pat Lupinetti with 3:30

and heavyweight categories. and West Virginia was
_, trounced, 33-6.

Jim Caramanna and Carl Roba-copped the 190 '

“The win, especially the big score was-sorely
neeeded,” said Dave Adams. “We should have had
a couple of meets like this earlier in the year,” he
said. “West Virginia isn’t the toughest team, but we
were concerned about our aggressiveness.”

The Mountaineers weren’t too enthralled about
it either, Dave.

Clarion. Friday night. the Cats continued their
aggressive tactics, but they weren‘t enough as Pitt

I fell victim to a Clarion powerhouse armed with four

state champions, 24-14."

The‘Panthers won four of the 10 matches and
gained a draw in another, "but were done in when

two-time Maryland state champ Ron Rohn and last .

year’s NCAA titlest Wade Schalles pinned Ron Sel-
fridge and Ray Dallatore at 142 and 167 pounds.

The meet’s outcome did not dishearten Dave
Adams. “We outconditioned them, and we were
more aggressive overall,” reported the coach. “The
younger kids are coming around. We can see im-
provement in every meet.“ '

Clarion got off to a 4-0 lead as Craig Turnbull
whipped Dave DeMarino at 118 pounds.‘ 15-0. but
' George “Fuddy" Bryant, recovered from a back in-

« jury, made it 4-3 with a 10-5 win over Kim Slye.

After Buzzy Beck drew with Jack Davis and
Selfridge was pinned by Rohn, John Buzzato ran his '
personal win streak to seven straight as he deci-
sioned Sam Baird,f5-2. The Cats tied the meet at 11-
11 when John Chatman beat Charles Burke, 12-8.

Atthat Clarion broke open the meet as they un-
limbered their heavy guns, Eastern All-Stars Schal-
les and Simpson. After Schalles pinned freshman
Ray Dallatore. Simpson gained/a superior decision
over Jeff Minard. also a frosh. and‘ suddenly the
team score was 21-11. Clarion. ‘

Craig Tritch beat 'Bob- Gordon ‘and 'Clarion's .

Coryea. another former state champion. whipped
Carl Roba. 4-1. to finish the scoring. with Clarion on
the long end of a 24-14 mark. The lost dropped the
Panthers season record to 3-5.

The Cats next wrestle on Wednesday night when
they trek out to Kent. Ohio. to duel the Golden
Flashes of Kent State.

MISCELLANEOUS

by YAIER LEHRER

The Pitt swimmers lost their third meet in a row to a tough Kent
State team by a score of 72-41 in Kent, Ohio, last Friday night.

KSU took 10 first places while the Cats were only able to muster

3 up three, all of them in the last three events of the meet.

John Templon set a new Pitt team record by posting a 2:17.4 mark
in the 200-yard breaststroke and only has to shave off two more sec-
onds in order to qualify for the NCAA’s as his teammates Mark Wallace
and Jeff Miller have already done. Miller did it in the three memter
diving and Wallace in the backstroke.

This is the first time the Pitt freestyle relay has won in any of its
meets. Ron Bokulic, who has been sucha pleasant-surprise for the team
lately, George Hawes, Eric Schultz provided the Cats with the punch
they needed to win that event.

John Muske of KSU won first place in the 200-yard backstroke

while Mark Wallace took second place and Ed Cahill. with his best time

of the season, registered a third place in the event.

Bill Martin also provided a pleasant surprise for Coach Brad-
shaw as he put in his best performance of the season in the individual
medley and in the 200-yard backstroke.

Mark Winters continued to be Pitt’s individual medley swimmer
as_ he took a third place in that race. Wallace has consistently placed
in the medley while being sick and not able to swim the distance races, _

The saddest note on this meet is the fact that the previously unde-
feated medley relay team defeated for the first time this season.
