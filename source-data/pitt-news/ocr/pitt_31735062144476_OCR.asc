Registration for the Evening
School will, for the ﬁrst time, be-
gin on Wednesday, January 31,

Dr. Chiu Chun

Dr. Cliiii *Ch11n

Teaches Native
Tongue at Pitt

Dr. Chiu Chun, one of China's
most distinguished sons, has arriv-
ed in Pittsburgh from Chungking
to teach at the University. A for-
mer member of Generalissimo
Chiang Kai-Shek’s supreme war
council, he also served as one of
a committee of governors of his
native Kiangsi Province.

Dr. Chiu has been educated on
three continents. He is a graduate
of Tsing Hua college in China. He
also studied at the University of
Washington, Seattle, and did grad-
uate work at Columbia university,
New York, where he was granted
the degrees of master of arts and
doctor of philosophy. He did post-
doctorate study in Munich and
Berlin.

He has taught in a number of
Chinese universities and was head
professor of education in the Na-
tional Peking university and also
in the National Southwestern As-
sociated universities when war
caused a group of Chinese colleges
to pool resources rather than to
discontinue.

Dr. Chiu has been named visit-
ing" professor at Pitt and will
teach students to speak, read, and
write simple Chinese. He will also
give a course in Chinese culture.

Exemplifying a new trend in ed-
ucation, according to Dr. Stanton
C. Crawford, dean of the College,
Dr. Chiu’s courses are listed in a
new program called Area and
Language study in which intensive
instruction is given in certain geo-
graphical areas. The language of a
locality, its history, climate and
resources, its social structure, and
all other phases of teaching are
grouped together for the contribu-
tion each can give towards a com-
prehensive picture, he said.

China and the Paciﬁc comprise
one of five areas which Pitt will
emphasize during the semester
starting February 5. Other areas
are France, Germany, Russia, and
Latin America, with a total of 65
courses taught by many members

of the faculty. Some subjects are

given in the day school and the
others in night school.

There will be a Pitt News
staff meeting Friday at 1:30
o’clock in the News office. All
members of the staff must be
present if they plan to write
during the spring semester.

Once there was a man of the people, named Abraham Lin-
“A nation

coln who had faith in single standard ‘economy. . _
cannot survive half slave, half free,” he said. And the pessiniists
called him impractical and visionary. _

Then there came a leader, aﬂectionately called Teddy, who
held a belief in successful operation of fair competition. He
went after the Trusts with his big stick, and the monopolists
shouted Visionary! and Impractical!

President Wilson was a man who had trust in the principle

. of reciprocal. ﬁscal responsibility of government and business.

He created the income tax laws. And the industrial barons
lavished no love on this “impractical visionary” in the White

House. ‘

Our own President Roosevelt, at the outset of the war, pre-
dicted that we would produce. 50,000 planes a year. He had
conﬁdence in the nation ’s power to produce. But‘ the reaction-
aries had no such conﬁdence in their country and. termed the
prediction impractical and visionary. _

Today there is a man, also a man of the people, who is a
progressive thinker and a humanitarian. Therefore it would be
unusual if he, also, were not dubbed impractical and visionary.
His name is Henry Wallace, and he has faith and conﬁdence in
America and her people and her power to accomplish worthwhile
projects.

_ There is going on in the Senate today the most important
political battle of our time. It is an issue with which all stu-
dents, all young people, should be vitally concerned. For it is

« our postwar bread and butter that the Senate Commerce com-

mittee is tossing around so lightly. _
The coalition of Republicans and conservative Democrats

‘ that backs Jesse Jones has no sympathy with the demand for

full employment after the War and no intent of doing anything
to bring it about. , They are concerned primarily w1'th.keeping
the capital and the powers of the Federal Loan Agency in hands
friendly to a.l_ittle group of monopolists. They want to manip-
ulate these taxpayers’ funds in their own way for their own

beneﬁt. Marshalled behind these men are more sinister forces,

the magnates and press lords who hope toutilize the discon-
tent of jobless veterans after the war to purge the progressives
from power. Subversive movements will enjoy a boom after
the war if the returning soldiers do not have jobs. _

And they will not have jobs unless plans are laid before-
hand to help business over the transition period, to provide
necessary public works, to plan needed expansion of business
by private enterprise with government aid.

For this program we need Wallace as Secretary of Com-

’m”erce. ‘He must be given power over the lending agencies

which can alone implement and ﬁnance such a program. Upon
the appointment of _Wallace and the mapping of a postwar full
employment program” may well depend the future of democracy
in America.

 "If Henry Wallace has any failings, they are merely that he
has fought hard for the extension of suﬁrage, that he favors
social reform, that he is 100% for the common man, and that he
is very much American, in the best sense of the word.

Yes, Wallace is visionary and idealistic, if that ’s what :the
conservatives, poll-taxers, pro-fascist crackpots, moneyed barons,
and.a host of others will persist" in calling it. Possibly he is
too many years ahead of his time. However you remember that
old adage about shooting for a star. You may fall short of :that
goal, but if you do, you’ll go further than if you aimed at the

I top of the Maple tree in your front yard. That’s why youth

War, like other ill winds, usually leaves a few particles of
good scattered in its wake. Our passage through the ordeal of
Mars is resulting in an America which has become a friendlier
and more closely knit nation. Not since Revolutionary times
have we shared one common goal for so long a time.

_ We have been engaged in global conﬂict for over three
years now and no one expects an immediate peace on all fronts.
Meanwhile, our democratic system of selective service has
brought the war home to rich and poor alike. The prosperous
manufacturer and the tiny shopkeeper have suddenly found
themselves with something in common—-someone in the service.

bandage-rolling sessions at the Red Cross. That man spending
long hours over a throbbing machine at the war plant may be a

’ In spite of political bickering and sectional squabbles, we
will emerge from this war with. the greatest feeling of national

7/au Ram

By Deirdre Baird

If you’ve ever, in a moment of
excitement, gone into a restaurant
and ordered “prewed stunes,”
you’ll remember the experience as
an embarrassing one. That’s be-
cause you're just small potatoes.
Any fool can get his tongue twist-
ed around “fried oysters” so that
it comes out “froyd iesters;” but it
takes a real genius to make a
lapsus linguae immortal. Like the
woman who introduced her little
boy to the psychoanalyst as “my
last sin.” Or like the Reverend
William A. Spooner. ‘

The reverend doctor Spooner
lived in Oxford, England, and
spent 86 eventful years getting
into hot water every time he
opened his mouth and becoming
more famous every time he did it.
He made tongue twisting an art,
gave a "couple of generations of
Oxford students something to
write home about, and got the
word “spoonerism” -into Webster's
dictionary.

As far as I know, Dr. Spooner
had no Boswell. But a sizeable
handful of his verbal faux pas,
real or apocryphal, have been
tenderly preserved by admirers of
his talent. There is, for instance,
his enthusiastic ' statement that‘
nothing is so pleasant as pedaling
through the English countryside

on a “we1l-boiled icicle.” His de-
scription of how the enemy was
dealt a “blushing crow” is fam-
ous, as is his patriotic gesture
during Victoria's jubilee celebra-
tion, when he urged his students
to give “three cheers for the queer
old Dean.” The unhappy doctor is
said to have involved himself in

«matrimonial diﬂiculties when he

informed a neighbor /that his wife
was out “stealing at the doors,”
and one Christmas he got into all

sorts of trouble by expressing his

delight in the old English custom
of bringing in the—w'ell, you fig-
ure it out for yourself.

Some of !Dr. Spooner’s most in-
spired remarks, however, seem to
have been made in chapel. Once,
while help.ing to seat some dis-
tinguished visitors, he is said to
have explained, “I’m sorry,
madam, but this pie is occupewed.
Step right this way and I'll sow
you into another sheet.” On an-
other day, the service was longer
than usual, and the boys began to
nod and slump down in their
seats. Dr. Spooner rapped on his
lectern. “I refuse,” he said sternly,
“to stand here any longer and gaze
upon these beery w_fenches!”

It’s merely silly when, on our
tongues, a “near-blown rose” be-
comes a “rear-blown nose.”

Talk Can BeRaised To Art ,
By Intelligent Forethouglit

With the world full of armchair strategists, post-war world

planners and dogmatists on every subject, the art of ﬂuid con-
versation with its interchange of ideas is rapidly becoming sub-
merged in a sea of positive declarations that brook no discussion.

Jones has spent a few hours with a map of Burma and the
opinions of a few military analysts and he’s bound and deter-
mined that the company will hear his views on just what it is
that Lord Mountbatten is doing wrong. Nor does it occur to him

,not interested, listen and perhaps
;r¢qu_w 1,b;ecome;, interested; we a__115

that perhaps his hostess might be more interested in discussing

the la:test play or his host of the

Yankees’ pennant chances.

In an effort to return conversa-9

tion to the high standing which it
once enjoyed among cultured peo-
ple, D. C. Russell discusses the
art of conversation in the May
issue of Good Housekeeping mag-
azine.

“Conversation is a communal
matter,” he writes. “It concerns
other people, and like all com-
munal matters should be subject
to restrictions. We are not allowed
to make nuisances of ourselves in
our communities, for the law
would stop us quick, whether it
be for the possession of an angry-
minded dog, the playing of a
loud-mouthed radio, or the tend-
ency to take something that an-
other possesses.”

From a wealth of experiences in
the company of good talkers, the
writer -offers the following valua-
ble suggestions on the art of con-
versation:

“Even if the conversation is
about something in which you are

 

 

.9 

conversation as an art it adds
little except malice and indicates
chieﬂy a sterility of ideas; trying
to win by raising the lev-el of your
voice will not raise the level of
the conversation; the point of an
argument is not to show how
right and infallible you are but
to draw forth opposing views.”

aroun»d the University that the
Pitt dances, are to be canceled un-
til the Spring Festival, allow this
column to make ‘it known. Per-
sons in authority have said that
the Student congress has made
this state of affairs almost certain.

Why? The reasons given have

been this: financially, the Pitt»
dances of the past semester have
been in the red; also, the school
spirit and cooperation concerning
these affairs haven’t been up,._to
par.

The Heart Hop was canceled for

cause girls said (ahem!) there
aren't enough men around to
take. Ah, for the air corps!

, But on to the matter at hand.
(Trumpets here.)

Students happen to be pretty
hepped about this situation of no

one can blame them. What’s col-
lege without proms? Does the
University intend having the fra-
ternities supply the gay times?
And what about the independ-
ents? Where would they come in
if fraternities sponsored the social
angle, which certainly would be
limited?

None of the students want
dances that will lose money, of
course. Agreed that it would be
far better not to have any. But
we feel we weren’t given a chance
with the dances of the past sem-
ester. Affairs are sold to the stu-
dents largely by the publicity.
The publicity for every dance w-as
hampered one way or the other.
Only a certain number of posters
are permitt-e_c\i to be tacked around
the University, an-d not a great
number at that.
whatsoever is allowed in the Tuck

_us- this year. No -hand bills . _. .
and the list goes on and on. No
wonder students don’t want to go
to a prom.“ They scarcely know
-_there’s going to be one. .‘

If Student congress deﬁnitely
decid-es against all future dances,
it will be sad indeed. We want
dan-ces; we want successful dances,
ﬁnancially and socially. It’s re-
grettable the past affairs have
been ﬂops. Perhaps if we are per-'
mitted to -have another one, that,’
too, will go*‘~into the red. But why
not give us another chance? And
why not also give us a free, or at
least a generous, rein on publicity?

Note the; Phil Baker questions.
We'd like ’the answers ’cause a
lot of us _are a bit peeved. Are
you gonna humor us?

Death Takes William Root,

Dean of Gradua

Dr. William T. Root, dean 01¢

the Graduate School and head of
the psychology department of the
University, died in the Presbyte-
rian hospital Wednesday after-
noon, January 24, of a heart ail-
ment.

Dr. Root came to Pitt in 1919 as
professor of psychology. Ten years
later he was made head of the
department. Always active in his
ﬁeld, he sponsored the Pitt Psy-
chological clinic. This clinic oper-
ates in cooperation with various
social organizations to understand
better the reasons behind the
social problems they encounter.
He was vice-president of the
board of directors of Western
penitenti-ary and served as psy-
chologist on the State Board of
Parole. He wrote several books on.
psychology and criminology, two
of which are Psychology for Life
Underwriters and Handbook of
American, Prisons and Reforma-
tories. He is also the author of
many articles on personality and
character and the cause of crime.

weather maps.

The advanced physics course
will be offered by Dr. Max A.
Lauffer and will introduce a
course in biophysical methods
which will consider the theory
and practical applications of dif-
fusion, viscosity and electrophore-
sis, and the use of the ultracen-
trifuge and the electron micro-
scope.

Dr. Reid T. Stewart, among the
last and best loved professors of
the old Western University of

neering. He thus established an
all -time record for his 59 years
of service, 48 of which were spent
on the campus.

Dr. Stewart was one of the
pioneers in the development of
seamless steel tubing. An authority
in this ﬁeld, he served for many
years as consultant for the Na-
tional Tube company. He Was also
known for his work in the car-
buretio-n -of fuels and served as
consultant for the Stromberg Car-
buretor company. His further
researches were in the properties
of carbolic acid and its transpor-
tation for industrial uses.

Since 1933 he had been living
in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, but
made frequent trips to Pittsburgh
to attend University gatherings.

Dr. Stewart was born in Par-
nassus, Pa., April 22, 1861. ‘He
received his bachelor’s degree
from the University in 1884, ‘his
civil engineering degree in 1885,
and his master’s degree in 1887. In

John Donaglly
Paintings in
Fine Arts

The current display of paintings
and drawings ‘by John Donaghy
in the Fine Arts gallery is one of

a series of exhibitions on the work
of Pittsburgh artists. Many of the
pictures have been loaned by Mr.
and Mrs. John W. Donaghy of
Pittsburgh. Mr. Donaghy is the
artist’-s son. Other Pittsburghers
and residents of nearby towns as
well as. the Carnegie museum and
library have contributed the rest
of the artist's works for the occa-
sion. '

The exhibit is being presented
in the hope that by this acknowl-
edgement of Donaghy’s accom-
plishments as a late nineteenth-
and early twentieth-century local
artist a greater -consciousness of
the work of our present—day
painters may be created.

John Donaghy has captured the
spirit of living, vibrant America
in his depictions which accurately
reﬂect the trend of his own time.
There is an irresistible quality of
intimacy in some of his everyday
life scenes as typiﬁed in examples
such as Fingers Before Food,
Stealing Sugar, The Barber’s Ap-
prentice, Children. Fishing, and
On Friendly Terms. Some of these
portray his own children when
very young and reveal a homelike
atmosphere. The grandeur and
serenity of the Florida landscape
views mirror the peaceful flow
of his last years in a southern
idyllic setting.

Much local color is seen not
only in his oil paintings but in
the sketches, many of which pre-
sent vivid scenes of the famous

Pennsylvania riots of 1877. An

outstanding illustration of this in
sketching is the, Burning of the
Round House at 28th Street, Sat-

‘ urday, July 21st, 1877,, Midnight,

in oil, Burning of the Grain Ele-
vator, Riots of 1877. Both of these,
representing the two types of
Donaghy’s artistry, have been
reproduced in Fleming’s Views of
Old Pittsburgh and disclose his
sense of drama and action.

Four Turkish Government students received their master of sci-
ence in engineering degrees at Pitt January 26. Left to right they are:

N. A. Gokcen, Nezih Rona, Nezam Ergil, and Adnan Erkmenol.

All of

them received their degrees from Pitt on Turkish Government schol-

arships.

All but Gokcen were enrolled at the University of Liege,

Belgium, when the war broke out and made their escapes through
France ahead of the advancing German army.

By Jeanette Feldman and

Ever since he came here last
winter to conduct the premiere
of his symphony Jeremiah, Leon-
ard Bernstein has been the sub-
ject of much enthusiastic discus-
sion in Pittsburgh musical circles.
Mr. Bernstein, you’ll recall, is the
twenty—six—year-old wonder who
last year, on a few hours notice
and without rehearsal, substituted
for Bruno Walter and led the New
York Philharmonic in a remark-

able concert. Since then his Jere-
miah and his music for the ballet
Fancy Free and the current
Broadway hit On the Town have

been warmly received by critics

and public alike.

So when we heard that Mr.
Bernstein was to appear again in
Pittsburgh, this time in the quad-
ruple—threat role ‘of conductor,
composer, pianist, and lecturer,
we thought you’d like to hear
more about him. Concealing our
bobby socks in borrowed rubber
boots, we pounced upon Mr. Bern-
stein after his rehearsal in Syria
Mosque, and through a barrage of
questions thrown up by two wor-
shipping swooners from a local
high school, managed to talk with
him.

Mr. Bernstein is slight, dark,
and handsome. He wears bow ties
and then wonders why he is fol-
lowed by teen-age girl-s who
shriek, “Oooh, Lennie!” Eyeing
the two swooners, he deplored his
reputation as “The Sinatra of the
Symphony” and said the whole
business was best.forgotten. We
agree.

Mr. Bernstein wasborn in Low-
ell, Massachusetts, and attended

‘ the Boston Latin school and Har-

vard, majoring in music with
plenty of literature and philosophy
thrown in. Interestingly, Mr. Bern-
stein does not come from a musi-
cal family. He became interested
in music quite accidentally at the
age of ten, when an aunt, looking
for a place to store her piano,
put it in the Bernstein home. “I
fell in love with it immediately,”
he told us, “and screamed for
lessons. . . . Since then I’ve never
thought of any other career.”

As soloist in the Ravel piano
concerto, he combined beautiful
interpieration with skilled tech-
nique; and in his high—spirited and
amusing score for Fancy» Free he
showed himself a composer cap-
able of working in ‘a playful vein
as well as in the grand and som-
ber mood of his Jeremiah.

During our interview. the ver-
satile Mr. Bernstein cried with
mock dismay that he wouldn't
have time to prepare his lecture
for that evening. However, his
discussion in Foster memorial of
the relation of American popular
music to the total American cul-
ture was both coherent and in-
formative, delivered with admir-
able poise and without a single
note. At one point he paused to
illustrate the blues by sitting
down at the piano -and singing,
“My man don’t love me, he treats
me mean. . .” The lecture was
further enlivened by his Cycle of
Five Kid Songs, including I Hate
Music, but I Love to Sing and I
Don’t Believe in the Stork, Either.

Leonard Bernstein is a ﬁne
musician and a truly American
composer. We believe that in the
future he will continue to be a
vital and constructive force in
American music.

 

The enemy is still there.’

Recently a delayed report from

the disappearance of Major Glenn
Miller enroute between England

Glen enlisted in the Air Corps
in September, 1942, when his band
was at the very top of its popu-

all the army and air force bands
and to put on a weekly radio pro-
gram with his own band which
included many men who were
stars in his former civilian or-
chestra. “
He was famous not only for his
ﬁne trombone playing but for his
arranging talents which made his
band unequalled in beautiful sax
harmony and blend, with muted
brass backgrounds and remark-

Dear Fresh-men:

This is your ﬁrst day at Pitt, so
we of Pittpourri would like to en-
lighten you as to what goes
around here. (No one enlightened
us and look what happened. But
somebody" -has to write this, and
we’re t-he two foul balls who were
draf——no, no, not that!) Anyhow,
we’ll let you in on some of the
secrets of the News.

Sooner or later you will learn

to turn ﬁrst to Pittpourri when ‘

you . receive the “Wednesday
Morning Special,” in order to ﬁnd
out who’s who, what’s what, or
even when’s when.

Pittpourri is the Humor and
Rumor column. It is always gay
and amusing—full of intellectual
college c-hit—chat. No one starts his
Wednesday right until he has read
it. Pittpourri has often been im-
itated, but never equalled.

F’r instance (speaking of imita-
tions), there is another column in
the paper formerly intended to be
informative. It was a sort of
what’s - going — on - this - week -
end - at - fraternity-houses. How'-
ever, into this has crept a certain
feeble attempt at humorous quips
which are no doubt intended to
trick the reader into giving the
column more than a passing
glance.

But don’t be so foolish! The
writers of Pittpourri want to set
you freshmen on the right track.
In case your eye is caught by the
title, “Frat Facts by Buddy Lench-
ner,” just remember that for a
really off-the-record View of
what’s going on around here—see
Pittpourri!

(Note to Lenchner; -Can you top
this?)

Incidentally, frosh, we want to
introduce you to some people who
hit Pittpourri so often that we’re
considering a slight commission
basis for all the publicity.

First of all there’s Fergie, alias
the Sultan, alias Dr. John Fergu-
son, economics prof .  you’ll be
hearing a lot about him. Then,
there’s Bill Humes who will soon
be dazzle-dusting the eyes of an-
other class of freshmen women.

How to Get Your Name in Pitt-

1. Just drop a slip of paper into

2. Do something spectacular!
Don’t be the mouse type. If you

Covies Eager To Break Jinx

By Larry Bondy .
The Pitt Panthers are back in the win column again by virtue of

T a 67-41 win over Carnegie Tech and now await the Geneva Coven-

anters tilt. This contest, which takes place at Beaver Falls High
School gym at 8:15 o’clock, Saturday, Feb. 3, will go a long way in

deciding the district championship.

Pitt meets the Covies for the second time this season and sports

a 49-45 victory. The Carlsonmen

have beaten‘ Geneva ﬁve straight

times, six of the last eight games,¢

and the doctor hopes that the jinx
will be kept alive. Geneva has
dropped 4 g.am-es against 5 wins
and boasts a much stronger team
than the records show. The Covies
dropped 3 straight games by four
point margins to the towering
Titans of Westminster, Pitt,
Akron, and on Saturday the West
Virginia Mountaineers eked out a
52-50 triumph.

The Pitt team then went to pieces
as they lost“ the l-ead and failed
-to regain it. Malarkey saw'1ittle

knee responds t-o treatment he
might a-gain lead the Phantoms to
their sixth win.

Dr. Carlson will start the same
line-up that set back the Covies
in the stadium. Nate Apple and
Tay Malark-ey will be at the for-
ward positions. Tay topped both
teams in scoring in their last
meeting with 15 points. Hank Zel-
lers will play the pivot position. The
former Washington and Jefferson
star has at last mastered his new
role on the court, that of getting
the ball off the back board. In
his early days on the ﬂoor Hank
played forward and left it up to
an-other team mate to retrieve the
ball but being -the giant on this
year’s Pitt team the doctor gave
him a new job to fulﬁll. At the

Tay’s Back To Lead Cagers

If Dr. H. C. (High Class) Carl-¢
son’s. young basketballers come
close to a “Win ’Em All’ season,
probably the fellow most responsi-

ble--next to the good doctor him-
self-—will be Clair (Tay) Malar-
key, captain of the ice cream eat-
ers.

The Bridgeville dental student
has played a major part in the
Panther victories over Geneva,
Carnegie Tech, and Penn State,
and rather signiﬁcant was the fact
that Tay was sidelined with a
knee injury during the West-
minster defeat. At the time he
left, in the middle of the second
quarter, the Pitt team was match-
ing the Towering Titans point for
point. After ‘Malarkey limped from
the court, the Panthers were
swamped 68-47.

In the Geneva fray, he scored
15 points, seven of them on free
throws, of which he missed only
one, for a remarkable percentage.
Held without a field goal in the;
first half, during which the Covies
held the upper hand, Tay put his
mates out in front before the
third quarter was over as he
racked nine points in that all im-
portant ten minutes.

This is Tay’s fourth year as a
varsity man. He’s a senior in Dent
School and because of the col-
legiate ruling concerning athletics
has been allowed to compete in
four years of Varsity ball. Last
season he played football for
Clark Shaughnessy, and received
an injury in that 1943 Notre Dame
game that kept him in the ‘hospital
for several months. However, he

‘7/te ﬂanilmei /94°12‘

By Ed Citron, Sports Editor

They said America. was soft and didn't have the guts.

At all our sports the Nazis scoffed, and claimed We lived in ruts.
They wrote men must be disciplined in order to wage war;
They whispered that free states were soft and rotten to the core.
Then, finally, we met and clashed and shattered all their myths,
We fought their 8. 8. storm troops with our Roccos, Gohens,

and Smiths.
We were not regimented and taught only to obey,
Instead we learned initiative that's paying off today.

Every operation had been Worked out previously in scores
of brass hat meetings. It was now or never. Those tanned,

_ grizzled youngsters, we call paratroops, had already tumbled
out of their lumbering C-47’s and ﬂoated gently down toward .

the German occupied soil of France that is better known as
Normandy. For the last twenty-four hours, throughout the day
and night of June 5, the American 8th Air Force had blanketed
the region with an umbrella of planes of every shape, size, and
description, and had pockmarked the Atlantic Wall with in-
cendiaries, fragmentation bombs, and blockbusters. Then, at
exactly H-Hour plus six, troop-laden landing craft scraped the
gritty sand beaches and disgorged their masses of humanity.
As soon as they’d scrambled ashore, grim, taut Yanks dug in
and faced a murderous, withering ﬁre from concrete pill boxes.
Belching machine guns took their toll, the famed German 88’s
stopped plenty of our Shermans, and their mortars sent shells
into our rear that played havoc with our supplies . . . but we
held. And then, when the signal came to go over the top, we
pushed inland inexorably. The Nazis were stubborn, tough, and
well-trained, but they were blasted out and forced to give
ground. That was June 6, D-Day. We not only won a battle
that day, we also proved to the world the superiority of Amer-
ican democracy to Nazi regimentation.

Sports are synonymous with democracy and they’ve ably

A demonstrated their worth in this world-Wide struggle. The kid

on the corner lot who could meet a blazing fastball or follow a
sharp-breaking curve, acquired muscle coordination and timing.
Cartersville High won the county football championship, be-
cause the squad learned to work together as a unit of eleven
kids who coordinated their efforts. It took ingenuity to pull a
“naked reverse” and precision to work the “T” formation. On
a basketball ﬂoor, speed and deception were elemental. In a
scramble under the banking board, you had to be rugged. All
of these games developed qualities in our youths of yesterday
that are standing them in good stead as our ﬁghting men of
today.

The twenty-year old kid, fumbling with the controls of a
shot-up B-17 Flying Fort, had to keep collected inwardly as
he’d been ﬁve years before when he called signals in the state
championship football game. He was desperate. A cold sweat
covered his ashen face. Only twenty miles to base, but the ship
was getting out of control and veering perilously. Motors one
and two were vibrating so hard that the right wing might have
dropped ‘off at any second. What to do? Gotta think. Think,
think. Think, My God. Think to live. And then, high over
the choppy waters of the channel about four miles from the
coast, he shut oﬁ all motors and started to glide in, with hopes
of reaching the smooth, barren shore. The lives of his nine
crewmen rested with him. Hoping against hope, struggling
with controls half knocked out, he hurtled through space at 300

miles an hour in what might be a dive of death. But it wasn’t,.
he made shore and crash landed. He saved his crew and him- =

self. And he had done something else. He had shown the su-
periority of a home town baseball lot and gridiron to a Hitler
Youth Camp. "Through sports, that had been his heritage, he

‘ had acquired precision, coordination, perfect timing, skill.

certain number of sports events
scored in this annual award. Win~
ners of the individual events are

Madam Francis Perkins spoke re-

by the editorial that was run in
the Silver and Gold, their school
poper. It began: “It was a great
privilege to hear Madam Perkins,
regardless of what any of us
thought of the talk itself.” . . .
Here’s a ditty picked up from the

Now who the heck had let the
