The panther arrives

The Millennium Panther, Pitt’s
$62,000 bronze mascot, is
unveiled during a soaking after-
noon shower. The statue — a gift
to the University from Pitt’s 1999
Student Government Board ——-
draws protest, too. Some students
chant, “Students, not statues,” and
say that the bronze beast is evi-

‘ dence of SGB’s unwillingness to
put students ﬁrst.

Tower showers likely

Tower B is evacuated as hun-
dreds of gallons of’ water — at a
rate of 50 per minute — gush from
,a sprinkler head in the building’s
topmost ﬂoor. Many students feel
the wrath of ﬁre safety: Water
damages computers, appliances
and personal effects seven ﬂoors
down.

Putting politics aside

A week to the day after the ter-
rorist attacks, SGB holds a vigil on
the Cathedral lawn to honor vic-
tims in New York, Washington,
D.C., and nearby Somerset, Pa. A
bagpiper plays “Amazing Grace”
and “God Bless America,” and stu-
dents ﬁll sheets of paper with their
thoughts about the events. SGB
plans to bind the journals and pre-
serve them at Hillman Library.

Terrorists ‘ attack

Everything changes. America
is attacked by terrorists, and the
country watches as the World
Trade Center towers fall to the
ground. VV1th the collapse comes
the collapse of a certain sense of
security, even in Pittsburgh. All
ﬂights are grounded. Downtown
buildings, as well as the Cathedral
of Learning, are evacuated, and
classes are canceled as a shocked

. campus stares dumbfounded at
television sets. Thousands die as a
result of the attacks.

  

 
  
   

America unites in aftermath

Immediately, Pitt comes
together. In the wake _of an attack
that will forever seem unbeliev-
able, members of the campus com-
munity sponsor vigils, peace ral-
lies, forums on racial tension that
resulted from the attack and fund-
raisersto support the relief efforts. -
Vigils honoring the victims pop up
across campus,. and in the South
,Side, a local tattoo shop begins
offering free American ﬂag tat- _
toos.

0 Oakland homicide still unsolved

Shortly after 2 a.m., Robert
Beeman, 24, a non—student from
Wilkinsburg, Pa., is shot and killed
at the comer of Forbes Avenue and
Bouquet Street. Several witnesses
tell police that an argument precip-
itated the gunﬁre, and the shooter
ﬂed on foot.

Fire‘-bombing vinjures'fou'r

Seven ﬁre companies respond
to an early morning ﬁre on Meyran
Avenue, requiring 40 minutes to
extinguish what authorities believe
was a fire-bombing. The fire
spreads to three neighboring hous-
es and sends four people to local
hospitals with minor injuries.

Anthrax scare on campus

At about 9 p.m., a man identi-
fying, himself as Ali Mohammed
makes his first of two calls to 911,
this time stating that anthraxwill
be pumped into the \V1lliam Pitt
Union within three minutes. Forty
minutes. later, the caller targets
Hillman Library. Authorities" —
many donning A gas masks —
respond, and most of lower cam-
pus ‘is evacuated. Pitt and the FBI
offer $15,000 in exchange for
information leading to the caller’s
arrest. He has yet to be identiﬁed.

OPPOSITE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL ' OPEN 7
DAYS A WEEK ' WHEEL DELIVER AVAlLABLE

  

New Year at home in Gettysburg.

But many of the patients and fami-
lies are not so lucky. For them
Christmas is going to take place at the
Family House, interrupted by treat-
ments and hospital visits‘.

“Holidays at Family House are

wonderful and exciting, but really diffi-
cult,” Siger said. ‘

To help brighten the holidays for
the families, the Blue and Gold Society
collected gifts in a project called
Operation Santa Claus. According to
Autumn Weller, the special events ‘coor-
dinator, the Society collected 177 ‘gifts

and $234 in donations. During the
weeks of Nov. 14 and Nov. 28, students
passing through the Towers lobby
signed up to bring in speciﬁc gifts, rang-
ing from socks and scarves to coffee
mugs and ‘Giant Eagle gift certificates.
On Dec. 5 the students dropped off
the various presents. The gifts were then
wrapped and deposited in brightly col-
ored piles under the Family House tree
in the newest house, opened on April 1.
‘On Christmas morning the 44 families
will all meet under the gold and white
tree where every member will receive a
present. The Blue and Gold Society has

helped with this project for the last 10
years.

Pulig reiterated the importance of
having a Christmas celebration for the
residentsof Family House. “Anything
that anchors you back into normal real-
ity makes such a difference” she said.

The members of the Blue and Gold
Society also see the importance in the
event. Laura Hepler, a junior at Pitt, has
helped with the program for the last two
years. .

“One way of sharing the pride for
the University of Pittsburgh is sharing it
with the community,” she said.

EDITORIAL

A world of giving

The Pitt News has just ﬁnished its
holiday shopping for its readers. Hope
you like your gifts. If you’re looking for
ideas on what to give your loyal jour-
nalists, read on.

- Finals traditions. At many other
schools, ﬁnals week equals getting-
naked—and-running—around-campus
week. Not at Pitt. While we don’t nec-
essarily advocate complete nakedness,
something similar could bring more
merriment to the week.

- A reading period. Think about

this: Finals week sucks, but it sucks
even more since we don’t have extra
study time beforehand. A reading peri-
od of a few days -— like our counter-
parts at Carnegie Mellon University
and several other schools have -
would make our lives much easier.
4 - Normal weather. Admit it —— as
much as you may have enjoyed the
warm weather the last couple of weeks,
it’s almost impossible to get into the
holiday spirit with weather like this.
Besides, if the temperature does remain
cold throughout the break, those who
go to the Tangerine Bowl can laugh at
their friends freezing their asses off in
Pittsburgh. Good incentive to go, eh?

- Victory in Orlando. You could
argue that the football team turning its
record around from 1-5 and gaining a
berth in the Tangerine Bowl is enough.
But we’re Scrooges and that’s not
enough for us. After last year’s humili-
ation at the Insight.com Bowl, we want
the Panthers to win the Tangerine.

But since we are nice as well, we’d
like to give some things (or would like
everyone else to give some things) to
the Pitt community, such as:

- To the panther statue, tanger-
ines. Walking by the panther outside the
William Pitt Union, sometimes you will
notice tangerines in its mouth, for rea-
sons we hope are obvious to all by now.
But some grinches keep taking them
out. Stop that. Our Panther is hungry
for tangerines, and she won’t be satiat-

' ed until after the Pitt victory Dec. 20.

- To the members of Student-.

Government Board, Robert’s Rules of
Order. This is what they supposedly use
to run their meetings. Trust us, some of
them need more copies.

- To C.J. Barney’s and the
Beehive, new establishments. In 2001,
Forbes Avenue lost two of its most
unique ‘businesses when C.J. Barney’s
and, the Beehive closed. Those proper-
ties have remained abandoned since,
and Forbes Avenue is not the same.

0 To the soon-to-return vendors
outside the Union, sturdy, attractive
tables. Since this was apparently one of
the snags in their return, we’d like to
resolve that and welcome the vendors
back to campus.

0 To Scotty the hot dog vendor
outside Hillman ‘Library, naming
rights for a building. While it’s easy to
impress your parents by showing them
the Cathedral of Learning, don’t you
think they would be more impressed by
the “What’s up Dad Cathedral of
Learning,” named in honor of one of
many famous sayings of Scotty the hot
dog vendor? '

- To the trees on the rest of cam-
pus, lights. Last year, Pitt added lights
to some of the trees outside the Union.
But that is not nearly enough. The rest
of the campus needs arboreal nocturnal

. illumination as well.

- To the students, a completed
Petersen Events Center. Soon the
University will complete the long-
anticipated Petersen Events Center, and
we hope that concerts and festivals
specifically for the student body will
accompany this new facility where our
revered stadium once stood. It would
help too if the basketball team could
continue winning. p

0 To Penn State, bad football and a
crappy rural campus. Oh wait, already
been given. Our apologies. Not. .

And ﬁnally, to everyone in the Pitt
community, we’d like to give a safe
and happy winter break. We’ll see you
back here Jan. 7. ‘

According to the commonwealth of
Pennsylvania, I became an adult three years

* Focus: Human cloning

Government must protect us
from clones  

Imagine that you are surrounded on
all sides by people who look exactly like
you. Every facial feature on every person
is identical, and even the voices and man-
nerisms are alike. For all intents and pur-
poses, everyone is the exact same person.

No, I’m not describing life at Penn
State. Rather, I am describing a situation
that is almost as scary, a science ﬁction

sect of the population that acts alike,
thinks alike, wears Abercrombie and
Fitch and conducts a large variety of
male-only activities. Since this niche is
already ﬁlled by fraternities, gay—parented
gay clones would be redundant for soci-
ety. .
The Arnold Schwarzenegger movie
“The Sixth Day” clearly presents another,

fantasy that may soon
become reality as a result of
human cloning.

Since the recent
announcement by
Massachusetts biotechnolo-
gy ﬁrm Advanced Cell
Technology that it had suc-

 

more intangible danger of
human cloning. By serving

can only hope that “Star
Wars Episode II — Attack of
the Clones” won’t suffer

prominent in political
debates.

As always, there are the socialist-
Clintonite-tree-hugging-bleeding-heart
liberals taking a stand for cloning, making
easily ignored arguments about the possi-

ble therapeutic beneﬁts of human cloning

and the reproductive choice that it offers
people who could otherwise not have
children. “Clones are people too,” this
faction seems to be shouting, and their
resistance to legislation that would outlaw
any attempt at human cloning could lead
us to a world corrupted by mad science
and genetic clones.

Imagine the terrible things that would
happen if cloning were to be legal.
Suppose an al Qaeda scientist were to use
genetic material from Osama bin Laden
to create an army. of super-terrorists that
could take over the world. Or, perhaps
even more disturbing, imagine that AT&T
uses genetic material from prop-cornic
Carrot Top to create an army of super-
spokesmen that would irritate TV viewers
for generations to come. The implications
in either case are chilling. ‘

Cloning advocates have argued that
cloning would allow homosexual men a
chance to reproduce. VV1th this in mind,
imagine the tragic side effects that would
result from a generation of gay-parented
gay clones. There would be an entire sub-

from a similar fate.
Disregarding all other arguments,
human cloning is morally wrong because
President George W. Bush said cloning is
morally wrong. Following the Advanced
Cell Technology armouncement, Bush

announced,‘ “I believe that cloning is

morally wrong.” Since questioning the
president is no longer done in the post-
Sept. 11 world, this statement is a p_ower—
ful argument in favor of banning human
cloning. .

Most simply, cloning must be banned
so that it is not a smirch on the name of
American science. We have given the
world the atomic bomb, DDT and Pepsi
One. To give another atrocity to civiliza-
tion would be to live up to all the slurs and
condemnations _that have been heaped
upon us by our enemies. ~ .

In effect, if we don’t ban human
cloning, the terrorists will have already
won. .

So next time you visit Penn State and
see the student body murmuring in unison
about JoePa and the Creamery, know this:
The future is coming, and if we don’t act
now, this is the tragedy that it will look
like. ’

“morally wrong. ’_’ He can be reached at

Few political debates are as much ﬁin as

More than a little bit of the resentment
against cloning can be attributed to the
prospect of offering gay people ameans of

 

ments is the actual argument What is so
scary that politicians want to forbid clones
before it is even possible- for them to exist?
Some are concerned that any attempts at
creating a human clone would result in hor-
rible defects or genetic mutations. While a
legitimate concern, natural reproduction rou-
tinely produces people wiﬂr horrible defects
and genetic mutations. If it didn’t, “The Jerry

Springer Show” would never have existed. '

At least with cloning, you have a pretty good
idea of what you’re going to get.

Some of the more melodramatic critics
of cloning have proposed scenarios in which
cloning is used tocreate genetic copies of
evil men such as Osama bin Laden, Adolf
Hitler or prop-cornic Carrot Top. This is a

purely idiotic argument ,

Even in ﬂre unlikely event that a scien-
tist would attempt to clone someone like bin
Laden or Carrot Top, the clone would not

have the same life experiences that shaped

bin ‘Laden and Carrot Top into the madmen

' they are today. Besides, there are far‘ easier

ways than cloning to make a power-mad
maniac, such as appointing a religious Zealot
to the post of attorney general. . .

. Another classic argument is that cloning
is an attempt at playing God. What’s wrong
with that? Man already has atomic bombs,

Still, personal prejudices are not enough
justiﬁcation to ban a ﬂedgling form of sci-
ence that may yield both therapeutic and
reproductive beneﬁts.

At its most basic, cloning is the attempt
to make a baby. Rather than being a distor-
tion of mad science, cloning offers the cre-

ation of a new life, the ultimate form of -

atonement for sinssuch as atomic weapons,

It offers, for those who can’t reproduce nat-

'urally, the means of achieving the most basic

kind of happiness, and if our government

succumbs to hysteria, it will be making laws ,

that move against the very freedoms for
which we are currently ﬁghting a war. _

In effect, if we ban human cloning, then
the terrorists will have already won.

The cloning debate is likely to be one
that continues up to the very moment that a

another. The most important question now_is

Affirmative action not solution for creating diversity

Though we’ve passed the. undergraduate admissions
process, none of us will ever forget the ordeal of applying to
college. A thick acceptance envelope can elicit

not the colors of our skin. No one had trouble ﬁtting in
because no one had to worry about whether or not he or she
“deserv ” to be there.

shouts of joy, while a sneeringly thin rejection
letter will send the recipient grasping for an
excuse. Being rejected can seem downright

But unfair enough to take to court?

That’s exactly what several students did
last year after being denied admission to the
University of Georgia, which The Washington
Post reported on Aug. 28. The students ﬁled
suit, contending that the school awarded scale-
tipping points to non—white applicants based

  

J. Elizabeth Strohm

Columnist

When a school tries to create a diverse
enviromnent artiﬁcially, it is bound to fail.
When it judged students by race, Georgia did
the same thing that we as a nation must dis-
courage. We can never hope to overcome
racism if we continue to use race for college
admissions — or anything else for that matter.

But if justice is our ultimate goal, we must
also question the appallingly small percentage
of minorities enrolled in college. Most colleges
offer a rather homogeneous student body of

 

solely on race.

Defending its policy, Georgia contended diversity is a
“compelling interest” that justiﬁed any minor disadvantages
non-minorities might incur. The school pointed out that the
issue of race, taken into consideration only among candidates
who did not make the ﬁrst—tier cut for admissions, did not
eliminate any strongly qualiﬁed applicants.

The U.S. Supreme Court did not buy the school’s
defense. Upholding a similar ruling from the Califomia state
court, it established’ that no school may consider race as a
deciding factor in accepting students.

In my experience at a high school where the broad mix
of people made everyone a “minority,” racial diversity
diminishes racism. Nobody was in a position to 
against anyone else. Race never aﬁected my choices in
friends or clubs, and people of all backgrounds generally
chose to hang out with each other.

But we mixed well only because things occurred natu-
rally. We all came together as a result of our circumstances,

rniddle-class white students. While we theoret-
ically choose a college for the academic merits it will pro-
vide, we also beneﬁt from the social and psychological
growth that comes from living in a community of people
with dilferent cultures and backgrounds from our own.

Although race should not be considered in the objective
decision of college admissions, colleges shouldn’t abandon
the attempt to encourage a diverse student body. If a univer-
sity wants to help minorities, it should do so by focusing on
the merits that each individual possesses. Although opportu-
nity may unfairly favor certain ethnic and social groups, tal-
ent itself knows no prejudice.

The University of California took this approach after
Proposition 209 in 1996 outlawed aﬁirmative action. It
pumped frmds and energy into recruiting students from rural
and urban areas — places where college attendance is_ gen-
erally less encouraged.

site (aad.english.ucsb.edu), California’s race-attentive out-
reach doesn’t stop at recruitment. The system also created a
strong web of retention programs, ensuring that the minority
students it courted into coming did not ﬁnd themselves aban-
doned as soon as they got there. Pitt would do well to put
more into similar endeavors.

By basing admissions decisions corrrpletely on grades
and SAT‘ scores, colleges overlook many hard-working but’
disadvantaged minority students. Conversely, a number of
smart kids with no desire to work gain easy admission into
college every year, only to drop out within a semester or two.

Though GPAs and SATs offer some insight into the
intelligence and potential of an applicant, numbers alone
cannot offer suﬁicient evidence of how a student will do in
college. Admissions boards must give equal consideration to
personal achievement.

In a ﬁnal effort to open opportunities to more students,
the California system olfers automatic acceptance to the top
4 percent in every. state high school, regardless of SAT‘
scores. Consequently, the top 4 percent of students attending
all-black city schools and economically depressed rural
schools gained a simple incentive to go on to college.
Though the program is still in its preliminary stages,
California’s system is already stating positive results.

, We must counterbalance the hurdles many face in
developing their gifts, but we should never disregard ability.
Americans are slowly abandoning the established custom of
deﬁning every person by his or her race, but the process will
require constant encouragement if we want it to continue.

Columnist J. Elizabeth Stmhm aclmawledges her terminal
optimism and hopes that more readers will be inspired to
share in it. Contact her at jestr0hm@yahoo.c0m.

DIANA MOFFO
Staff Writer

Ding, ding.

The elevator doors open and close
on the ﬁfth ﬂoor of the “Cathedral of
Learning. Can you hold the elevator, a
woman with messy chestnut hair yells
as she fumbles with her ﬁlled-to-the-‘
top backpack. Slam, slam. A lanky boy
with dark curls and a striped sweater
shoves envelopes in professors’ mail-

boxes. Squeak, squeak. A slightly wrin-_

kled janitor pushes a metal cart down

the hallway. Ding, slam, squeak. The
noise is enough to make you jolt, turn
your head, lose concentration.

Erin Teegarden doesn’t hear a
thing.

She’s deep in thought. Biting on
the end of a drinking straw, shejsays,
“It was a little idea someone had in a
bar.” The idea is Nidus, an online jour-
nal of contemporary art and literature

under the guidance of Pitt’s graduate '

writing program. Nidus made its debut
Dec. 1, but has been in the works for a
year.

“It’s good to know‘ that you are home for Christmas/It’s good to know that you are doing well.” —- Travis

Roll back the clocks to last
December. The winter air was becom-
ing more and more unforgiving. Pitt
students were huddled in comers of
Hillman Library, cramming for ﬁnal
exams. The streets were almost deso-
late. It was a stark time of year-— not a

time for breeding new ideas.’Teegarden a

had other plans. A
She went to a bar one night with
her friend, Cara Ford. The two girls,
both master of ﬁne ans candidates, sat
in the bar with their monthly plarmers
sprawled out in front of them. While
planning their holiday festivities,
Teegarden realized something — she

- had to create a literary journal. Itwas

something she had always thought
about doing and now was the time.
Teegarden looked at Ford and said,

PAGE _14

—.— “E
\

I

" ‘-‘We should just do this.”

Recalling her spontaneous decision
to embark on such a large project
makes Teegarden laugh. Her blond
hair, casually swept back into a pony-
tail, rests on her shoulder as she speaks’
about the night in the bar.

“The two of us tendto be dreamy,”
she said. . g .

; Teegarden and Ford called Mike
Bunn and Dave Carillo, friends and fel-
low Pitt graduate students, on a cell

-phone and told them about their idea.
Their response? “OK.”

The next step was to bring the idea
to the English department. A week after.
the bar trip, Teegarden had ascheduled A‘
meeting with Lynn Emmanuel, the
writing program’s director. Teegarden,
a second year poetry student in the
MFA program, plarmed to discuss her
poetry with Emmanuel at the meeting.

. Instead, the two spent most of the

» meeting discussing Teegarden’s journal

idea. _ T
E Emmanuel wasn’t thrilled.
‘She said it had been "proposed
before, but the-projectsnever came to
fruition. Why would Nidus be any,dif-

' ferent? Teegarden did not give up so

easily — this was important to her, to
the University and to the artistic com-
munity as a whole.

“I remember being very deter-
mined because [the journal] represents

‘ not only us, but a larger community,” ,

she ‘says while sitting outside the writ-
ing center.

Teegarden - eventually gained

' Emmanuel’s’ full support of the project.
‘Of course, Teegarden had her reserva-

tions, too.

“ We were hesitant about the pro-
ject being owned by the writing pro- .
gram. It was a little bit scary, but they
know better than we do,” she said.

Teegarden sits back in her chair
and rests her elbows on the wooden

This ‘horror’-ifyingsifilm studies professor is

an expert in scary movies

BEN MORIARTY
Staff Writer

Surrounded by movie posters and bookcases, Dr.
Adam Lowenstein sits calmly in his ofﬁce. Upon ﬁrst
glance he appears quite the cinema expert.

“I think about my interest in ﬁlm as one of those
happy coincidences where my hobby was able to
become my career,” he said. Having already appeared in
a documentary ﬁhn, and in the process of writing a

’ book, Lowenstein’s young career looks very bright.

Throughout his youth, Lowenstein often read inter-
views of his favorite ‘ﬁlmmakers.
His father was a professor at
Rutgers University in New Jersey
and this inﬂuence, combined with

his love for the cinema, helped .   Q . ,1} 

steer him toward a career as a ﬁlm

scholar. '    T; ;:= ’ .i i’   E

As a professor of English and g .
ﬁlm studies at Pitt, and’an accom— , , ,  '

4 plished scholar of horror ﬁlms,‘ F 
Lowenstein is very much in the d11'-    C» _; 

ver’s seat in both aspects of his pro- 1  _
fession. Ci   i
He was recently interviewed in

‘The American Nightmare,” a doc—     3;‘ ~7 3 3 i

umentary of 'l960s and 1970s hor-
ror ﬁlms, which included a Variety
of well—known directors such as
John Carpenter, Wes Craven,
David Cronenberg, John Landis

and George Romero. Lowenstein is - i

also currently working, on a book, which focuses on th

‘ modern horror ﬁlm in the context of socio—historical

trauma. . g .
-The thrill that horror ﬁlmsoffer their audiences is

‘one of the reasons Lowenstein was attracted to this

genre.

“I’ve always had a special affection for ﬁlms that ‘

were challenging to me, that were kind of ‘scary, or dis-
turbing, or unsettling, that made me think differently,”
Lowenstein said. . ’ '

For Lowenstein, the opportunity to discuss the
ﬁlms of his personal idols, in a production that also
included them, was the chance of a lifetime-. S

“‘American Nightmare’ was really kind of a dream
for me, because even though I wasn’t speaking to these
people directly, I was speaking directly about their
ﬁlms,” he said. “There’s moments in the ﬁlm where it
almost seems like we’re saying the same thing, and that,

to me, was very gratifying.” - — .

Although he did not directly work with these ﬁlm

icons, Lowenstein has had the privilege of speaking

with George Romero, director of such ﬁlms as “Night of
the Living Dead” and “Dawn of the Dead.” -Lowenstein

considers Romero one of his childhood idols and was A ’

very excited to meet _ ,
The professor is also currently trying to’ coordinate

‘ events with Romero, such as presenting some of his
‘ ﬁlms at Pitt. “[Romero] is an important part of history,
but he’s also continuing to make it,”'Lowenstein said. i .

K

— Adam ‘Lowenstein,

professor of film studies

U

Among his other projects, Lowenstein is also cur-
rently writing a book relating horror ﬁlms with tragic
events in history. Titled “Shocking Representation:
Historical Trauma, National Cinema and the Modern
Horror Fihn,” the book is an extension of his disserta-
tion, which he wrote while studying at the University of
Chicago.

The book focuses on the relationship between mod-
em horror ﬁlms (post—1960), and how they can repre-
sent moments of historical trauma or cultural crisis,
such as the Vietnam War and the bombing of
Hiroshima.

“[Because] ﬁlm is such a crucial medium for

expression in our time, why not
think about it in terms of the most

‘   /     7 crucial events of our time?” he said.

The book covers an intema~

‘j ’ ’ tional scope, looking at ﬁlms and
, /5,; events ranging from France to
;§‘=";i.ag"   j, England to Japan, as well as the

-v  El United States. Much like this broad

scope, Lowenstein would like for his
, book to reach a wide-ranging audi-
  Qf:"' ence, to move beyond just an acade-
if mic audience. Lowenstein hopes it

(1 E _j  2;; . Q’ ' reaches people who areiinterested in

ﬁhn, or in how culture processes

 “read thisbook and have ideas that
will change things for the better.”
Although his book is still

from publication, Lowenstein is
A _ already applying his research to the
courses he instructs. ,
“One of the great things about teaching at Pitt is that
there’s a lot of ‘room and ﬂexibility to bring your
research into theclassroom, even on the undergraduate
level,” he said. - Av

.As a professor, one of Lowenstein’s “most relevant.

courses, in relation _to the material covered in his book,
deals with representations of the Vietnam War in ﬁlm
' and literature. A ._ ’ S

T He expressed particular gratiﬁcation with the way
he has assisted his students in making connections
between recent traumatic events, primarily Sept. 11, and
the traumatic events surrounding the Vietnam War.

In addition to his efforts at Pitt, Lowenstein is also *

involved in the local Pittsburgh ﬁlm scene._ Aside from
attending Various events set . up _ by ‘ Pittsburgh.
Filmmakers, he isalso the associate director of Pitt’s
ﬁlm studies program and is very involved in the sched-
uling of visiting lecturers and ﬁlmmakers at the
University. ‘ i

In regards tothe ﬁlml scene, he feels that the stu-
dents are the ones who'are the closest to it.

“A lot of them are ﬁlm studies majors who are tak-
ing classes 'at Pittsburgh Filmmakers as well as taking
courses here at ‘Pitt, and a lot of them seem to be work-
_ ing on exciting projects,” he said." I T ‘

The Pitt News follows local hip-

JARED SHELLY
Staff Writer

As we walk down Broadway, the
bright lights of Times Square hit us from
every angle, and the three of us wonder
how we got there. Even though we are 15
minutes late for sound check, Tommy
breaks out the video camera to save this
moment. ' I
Through the camera, he sees two Pitt
students — his business partner Daniel
Flannery and me, the reporter, both dressed
in black suits. We happily make jokes to the
camera but are not sure what to expect from
the evening; all we know is that we’re on
our way to an exclusive club that represents
a chance for the cameraman, Tommy Mula.

Mula is a South Oakland resident and
one of the founders of his and Flannery’s
record label, N oddin’ Head Forest.

“This isn’t the thing to be late for, a
sound check at the China Club,” Flannery
says as we pass the MTV studios and stare
at 40-foot billboards of Rebecca Romijin—
Stamos.

Tonight is a chance for Mula and
Tenenbaum, who make up the hip—hop
group Black Lung, to perform in front of a
New York audience. Mula and Tenenbaum,
longtime family ﬁiends, began recording
together when they both expressed an inter-
est in hip-hop. Last summer they recorded
several songs together in Mula’s brother’s
studio in San Francisco.

The China Club is a popular hot spot in
New York. Celebrities like Adam Sandler,
Chris Rock, Tommy Lee, Derni Moore,
Bruce Willis and Jack Nicholson have
sipped on the club’s $8 drinks.

conversation with her fellow Nidus
staffers. “Is the outcome going to equal
the work we put into it? We said, ‘Yes.’

We don’t think about the why. We.think
about the how,” she says.

Once Nidus had backing, both cre-
atively from the ‘English department
and financially from the University, the
next step was to acquire submissions.
Teegarden sent out a letter to every uni-
versity creative writing program in the
country, calling for works “that are cut-
ting edge and of the highest quality?’-

. The submissions that Teegarden»

and her team received for the journal
all came through e—mail. , When
Teegarden received a submission, some
of which came" from as far away as
Africa and Alaska, through e—mail, she
forwarded the submission to one of the
three editors, depending on the genre of
the piece. _

From there, readers sorted through
the more than 300 submissions Nidus
received. Some of the submissions
were from established authors like
Denise Duhamel, the 2001 recipient for
the National Endowment for the Arts
Fellowship in Poetry, and Jane
McCafferty, the winner -of the 1992
Drue Heinz prize. Other contributors
are first-time authors.

Beatty was surprised at the high
caliber of the submissions for the first
issue of Nidus.

“’There’s a range of talent and qual-
ity for the first issue. We have people

who are thriving in the literary commu-

nity,” Beatty says.
Defining the tone of Nidus was a

Monday, December 10, 2001

somewhat difficult process for
Teegarden. How does she describe it?
“Accessible, interesting, relevant,
insightful, edgy, cutting—edge, fresh,
new and funny.” '

While each submission is different
from the next, Teegarden senses a com-
mon theme of alienation, separation,
distance and what Teegarden calls
“'out—of—placeness.” She suggests that it
relates to the Sept. 11 events. ‘

“People want to write about the
world, whatever’s inside them or out-
side them,” she says, with a look of
concern cast upon her usually bright
face. “Alienation is. a reﬂection of our
time. It’s just on people’s minds.”

Beatty agrees. Leaning forward in
her chair, she says, “It’s especially
important in these difﬁcult times. How
do we carry on? I believe art is the
answer.” She sits back again and thinks
silently for a moment.

“It’s a way to feel connected,” she
says.

Nidus has the potential to bring
people. together through writing. It
encourages us to talk about the differ-
ent lives we lead. It encourages indi-
viduality with a common bond: the
human experience. .

Teegarden’s “little idea” in a bar

just may be a bigger movement than '

she thought.

the original roonr, the Jade Tenace, for the
show. A
At 1 a.m., Mula, Tenenbaum and
singer Nicole Lozzo perform in the comer
of the Jade Terrace next to the DJ booth,
because that was as far as their microphone
wire would take them. a
With friends from Pittsburgh and other
partiers bouncing and screaming directly in
front of the perfor_mers, the normally
vibrant beats come out of the speakers ﬂat
and at a low volume. By the time Mula rec-
ognizes this problem, there is nobody in the
booth to correct the sound. Mula. and
Tenenbaum decide to ignore the errors and
just spit the lyrics hard and fast.

  

“Jenna Jame, Chasey Laine; Girls

This Week’

 

Gone Wild, I’m insane; know the face,

know the name; throw your mama from the
train,” raps Mula while wearing a Kangol
hat, a striped sweater, jeans and black
sneakers.

After Mula ﬁnishes his solo song
“Reality Check,” Tenenbaum spits the
lyrics for his solo song “Spell It Right”

“Kinetically I set it free energetically;
so many styles theoretically; I’m rhyming
like there’s 10 of me,” raps Tenenbaum,
who wears wind pants, a white shirt, sneak-
ers and a white visor over his shaved head.

‘ As they perform, Flarmery stands in
the back videotaping. About a year and a
half ago, Flannery and Mula began Noddin'
Head Forest productions, a record label

started while the two stayed at Pitt for.

spring break two years ago. A

s Student Organization Meetings and Events

 

Mula and Tenenbaum play the crowd
during their show. Mula slaps hands with
those dancing in front of him, and even
armounces two friends’ 21st birthdays to
the crowd.

The two of them have so much fun per-
forming that Tenenbaum doesn’t even
seem to mind when he has to reach his
microphone behind him so that Lozzo can
sing the hook after his verse.

The show ends rather abnlptly after

‘someone brakes a glass near the perform-
ers, and the poor sound system and lack of
a stage seem to supercede Mula’s and
Tenenbaum’s elforts.

Although there were technical prob-
lems, everyone involved with the show
remains optimistic about future shows.

“It wasn’t truly a performance atmos-

phere,” Tmson says after the show, “but all
I’ve gotten [ﬁ‘om guests] is positive feed-
bac ” .

Mula shares the same positive attitude.

“Just being in New York rapping with
[Tenenbaum] who I’ve known my whole
life was great,” Mula says after the show.

Mula and Flarmery hope that this is not
the height of their musical endeavor, but
just the beginning. After the show, a repre-
sentative from Cash Money Records
approached the two and eagerly exchanged
phone numbers with Flannery in an effort
to create some type of professional rela-
tionship with their record label.

After the show, we return to our hotel
where bottles of liquor await. It was 8:30 in
the morning before any of us wanted to end
our night in New York.

Florida bowl

nothing new

!:T77:r’I"

 

Sports Vrnw

Karen Bielak

If anyone had told me six weeks ago
that Pitt was going to a bowl game, I would
have laughed.

Now I’m laughing, but for different rea-
sons.

I’m laughing because I’m giddy in
anticipation of my trek down to Orlando,
Fla, to watch the Panthers play in the
Tangerine Bowl. It’s simply amazing that
this team has bounced back from a 1-5 start
to make it to the postseason.

I guess that’s why I’m much more
excited about the bowl game than I was
about last year’s Insightcom Bowl. Maybe
it’s alsothatthisyear,Iactually willbe going
to the game instead of pouting around for
weeks like I did last year when I couldn’t go
to Phoenix.

I’m laughing at all those people who
thought we wouldn’t beat West Virginia I’m
laughing at all those people who thought we
wouldn’t beat Alabarna-Birrningharn.

I’m laughing because I get to stay in a
hotel room that gives you robes. Sweet.

I’ve been to Orlando a gazillion times
and I’ve even been to the Florida Citrus
Bowl stadium — twice. So none of that is
new for me, but yet I’m bursting with excite-
ment.

Because this time when I go to the sta-
dium, it will be my school, my team. The
last time I was there was for the Citrus Bowl
on New Year‘s Day 1999, when Michigan

beat Arkansas and I was on national televi-

sion because of my performance in the half-
time show.

I was decked out in my cowboy uni-
form, doing a riﬂe routine to some time by
the Charlie Daniels Band And of course as
soon as the camera zoomed in on me, I
dropped my riﬂe. ’

So much for my few seconds of fame.

I was also there the year before when
Florida beat none other than our favorite

Pitt domes Penn Stte

KENNETH PAUL
Sports Editor

For the ﬁfth time this season, the men’s
basketball team held its opponent to 20
points or less in the ﬁrst half as it defeated
Penn State 83-53.

A crowded Fitzgerald Field House of
6,184 fans witnessed the dismantling of a
Penn State team that left its head coach Jerry
Dunn dejected and at a loss for words after
the game.

“I’m not quite sure that we even com-
peted today,” Dunn said as he stared down-
ward during the post-game press conference.
“We were as soft as tissue paper. I no longer
question our toughness because we don’t
have any.” ,

The Penn State olfense never really got
settled as it turned the ball over 22 times and
had trouble ﬁnding the rim. -

“I think because it was a Big Ten team,
we were a little more pumped,” Pitt point
guard Brandin Knight said. “From the
beginning it seemed that everything that they
ran, they were struggling to get open shots.” -

It was the outside shooting threat of
Knight, along with the inside presence of
Ontario Iett, that fueled Pitt’s offense.
Defensively, the two combined for ﬁve
steals. .

Panthers prepare for bowl rematch

BEN JOHNSON
Staff Writer

The Panthers and the North Carolina State Wolfpack
will get together on Dec. 20 for an old-fashioned rematch
of the Tangerine Bowl. .

North Carolina State and Pitt played in the 1978
Tangerine Bowl when Steelers head coach Bill Cowher
started at linebacker for the Wolfpack. This was also the
last time the bowl was played until now. Unfortunately, Pitt
lost the 1978 contest 30-17.

This year’s Panthers squad will look to erase what hap-
pened in the past, and they have a little history on their side.

Pitt (6-5, 4-3 Big East) and North Carolina State (7-4,
4-4 Atlantic Coast Conference) have a history. The two
schools met seven times with the Panthers leading the
series 4-2-1. Also, Pitt is 32-22-1 vs. an ACC opponent.

The Panthers earned their bowl bid by winning their
last five games of the regular season. The 24-6 victory over
Alabama—Birmingham earlier this month put the Panthers a
game over .500 and made them bowl eligible.

North Carolina State played a semi-tough schedule,
with their most notable game a 34-28 victory over Bobby
Bowden’s Florida State Seminoles.

Pitt has four Big East All-Conference players going
into the game. . . . ’

Junior wide receiver Antonio Bryant (ﬁrst team Big
East All-Conference) will lead the Panthers’ aerial assault
into Orlando, Fla. Bryant is averaging‘l5.7 yards per catch
and finished the regular season with a team-high 42" recep-
tions plus nine touchdowns and 659 receiving yards.

Quarterback David Priestley will take his 138.27 pass-
ing efficiency intothe game and try to connect with Bryant,
R.J. English and Lamar Slade for some Panther touch-
downs. '

The other ﬁrst team All-Conference members for the ‘

Panthers are juniors Ramon Walker and Gerald Hayes.
Free safety Walker led the Panthers with 120 tackles.
Hayes finished the season with 104 tackles, 62 solo, 15
tackles for loss and 6.5 sacks, which was second on the
team. '
Senior defensive end Bryan Knight made second team
Big East All-Conference. Knight, despite some injuries

early in the season, ﬁnished with a team-high 8.5 sacks.’

Also, Knight had 18 tackles for loss to finish the regular
season.

Pitt falls to Duqesne   ci

Assistant Sports Editor

The Pitt women’s basketball team had plenty of oppor-
tunities to overtake Duquesne in Saturday night’s matchup

I . but was once again plagued by poor shooting.

The Panthers shot less than 29 percent for the game,
falling to the Dukes 63-54 at Fitzgerald Field House.

“Six for 28 — oh my God,” Pitt head coach Traci Waites
said about her team’s three-point shooting. “Got opport1mi-
ties, shot more than they did, but just didn’t convert” '

The Dukes took an early lead and went up by as many
as seven points before Pitt answered back, tying the game
with 3 minutes, 24 seconds left in the ﬁrst half on a three-
pointer by Brooke Stewart. The teams went back and forth
during the ﬁnal minutes and entered halftime with Duquesne
leading 26-23.

The 23 points by the Panthers are the fewest the team
has scored in a half all season. The previous low had been 27
in the second half against Bucknell on Nov. 20.

Pitt struck ﬁrst in the second half, tying the game on
another three-pointer by Stewart and then took the lead on a
basket by Laine Selwyn. For most of the half, the teams bat-
tled back and forth, going up by just one or two points at a
time, as neither team could break away. ,‘

But the Dukes took control in the last four minutes of the
game, and the Panthers had a number of opportunities to cut
the lead with shots from the free-throw line but couldn’t con-
vert. ‘

“By missing those shots, Duquesne obviously went up,
and that changed the momentum,” Stewart said.

The Panthers were led by Selwyn, who ﬁnished with 18
points and six rebounds. Stewart, despite going just four of

Mandy Wittemnyer, who continues to struggle with an
ankle injury, had just six points but added a tearn-high nine
rebounds. The only other Panther to get on the board was
Haley Harguth, who contributed three points oﬁ the bench.
She was only one of eight from the ﬁeld, including one of six

from three-point land.

On the other side, the Dukes’ Candace Futrell put up 18
points in 30 minutes of play. Futrell, a sophomore, has been
given the task of ‘ replacing last season’s leading scorer,
Khalihah Este-Shehu, who is out for the season with a knee

5 injury.

“I’m deﬁnitely happy with [my role] and the way I’m
handling it,” Futrell said. “If it puts a lot of pressure on me,
then that’s'a pressure I want.”

The only other Duquesne player to record double digits 1

in points was Oxana Shetko with 10. Guard Shiri Sharon

   added a garne-high 10 rebounds.

This is the second consecutive year that the Panthers
have fallen to their city rivals, and the ﬁrst time they have
been defeated by the Dukes at home. Pitt previously held a
15-4 advantage in the series. _ 1 -

1 Before the game, Duquesne head coach Dan Durkin did
not even consider the fact that his team had never won at Pitt

“What I look at is that nine years ago when I came
onboard, we had never beaten them, never. We’re still a long
way out from evening this sucker up,” Durkin said. “I think’
I’ll have grandchildren by the time that happens.”

V The loss drops the Panthers to 3-5 on the season while
Duquesne improves to 3-5. p_ 1

Waites said her team admitted thatthey did not give
everything they had. She said they are mature because they
understand the things ﬂiey. need to work on, but tl1ey’re
young because tliey’ve never done it.

The Panthers will attempt to rebound when they travel
to Penn State Sunday. -

“It’s too long of a season to get down, there’s a lot of 1

things we have to work on,” Waites said. “We’ll bounce

ogize for not covering the Pitt game or any of the Bowl
Championship Series games, but the lines were not avail-
able at the time that I wrote this.

Seattle Bowl
Stanford (-3) vs. Georgia Tech
Stanford (8-2) does not get much coverage on the
East Coast, but the team as well as its conference is under-
rated. Underrated as the PAC-10 is, the ACC is that much
more overrated. The key factor in this game lies within the
coaching matchup. Head coach George O’Leary ditched
Georgia Tech only to be armounced as the new head coach
at Notre Dame yesterday. ’
, That really shows a lot of character to abandon the

kids that signed on to play with you with one game .

remaining in the season. Now the team has an assistant
coach rather than its original mentor to lead them on its
long trek across the nation.

The Irish pursued Stanford head coach Tyrone
Willingharn as well, but he didn’t jump ship, which gives
his team a distinct advantage. _

. Stanford beatseveral bowl teams this season, includ-
ihg Boston College, USC, UCLA and Oregon.
Quarterback Randy Fasani doesn’t make many mistakes

as he has only been intercepted four times this season. ’

cover against Yellow Jackets

VV1deouts Luke Powell and Teyo Johnson combined for
more than 1,300 yards and 14 touchdowns.

Georgia Tech lost three of its last four games. It
dropped games to Georgia, Virginia and Florida State,

while squeaking a victory out over a mediocre Wake’

Forest team.
Tech quarterback George Godsey has been inconsis-

-tent throughout the season, throwing 11 picks to~17 touch-

downs.

was as close, as Penn State would get to Pitt on the
Saturday aﬁemoon.

Knight and Lea combined for Pitt’s next _19 points,
with Knight rtmning off the next eight points for Pitt,

including two three—pointers, to give Pitt a 13-4 lead. The I

wide-bodied, 265-pound Lett had his way with Penn

State’s front line as he scored Pitt’s next six points.
Knight ﬁnished with a garne—high 23 points. He also

dished out six assists and grabbed four rebounds.

Lett, a junior college transfer who came to Pitt this
summer, racked up 16 points and six rebounds on the
day.

“How about picking [Lett] up in August?” Howland
said with a smile on his face to the media “You gotta g
lucky once in- awhile.” ' -

Mark McCarroll helped solidify the ‘Pitt defense as
he took one of his two charges, which led to Knight com-
ing down the court and hitting a rainbow three-pointer.
On Pitt’s next trip down the lane, Knight found himself
alone in the paint to put in a rebound and give Pitt a 24-

Panthers ready to avenge 1978 loss

Bowl, page 22

The Panthers’ offense will look to
continue their improvement from the
last ﬁve games. Pitt passed for 282
yards and two touchdowns against the

' No’. 1 pass defense of West Virginia

and rushed for 152 yards against the
No. 1 rushing defense of UAB.

Pitt’s rushing defense is ranked
28th nationally and has surrendered
only 41.4 yards on the ground over th
last five games. ~

North Carolina State will attack
Pitt’s rushing defense with the play of
senior running back Ray Robinson.

Robinson ﬁnished the regular season
with 818 yards rushing on 190
attempts. Robinson’s most notable
game of the season was against Florida
State when he rushed for 106 yards.

Junior Bryan Peterson and sopho-
more Jerricho Cotchery are the top
receivers for the Wolfpack. Peterson
led the team with 657 receiving yards
for the season, while Cotchery fin-
ished second with 483. Cotchery’s best
game was when he had 123‘ yards
receiving against the Maryland
Terrapins.

Senior linebacker -Levar Fisher
leads the Wolfpack defense. Fisher had

144 tackles for the season and became
the all-time leading tackler in
Wolfpack ‘history with 492.

Other defensive players to look for
on the Wolfpack roster are middle
linebacker Dantonio Burnette and
strong safety Terrance Holt. Burnette
finished second on the team with 110
tackles and '49 solos. Holt, the younger
brother of St. Louis Rams receiver
Tory Holt, finished third with 106
tackles. .

Kickoff is scheduled for 7:30 p.m.
at the Florida Citrus Bowl stadium in

 Orlando. The game will be televised

nationally on ESPN.

Insightcom Bowl
Syracuse vs. Kansas State (-5 1/2)

The No. 18-ranked Orangemen won
nine of their ﬁnal 10 games heading into

’ this one, with the lone loss coming in the

fashion of a 59-0 drubbing at

. Kansas State (6-5) might not have an
impressive record, but keep in mind who
they played. Kansas State lost close games
to Oklahoma, Colorado, Texas Tech and
Nebraska and finished the season with big

wins over Missouri and bowl-bound

Louisiana Tech. It also won at Iowa State,
42-3. «
The key to Syracuse winning will be
stopping the run. Kansas State’s Josh
_Scoey ran for more than 1,200 yards and
15 scores. Against top runners William
Green, Clinton Portis and Travis Stephens,
the ‘Cuse defense yielded 182, 128 an
111 yards, respectively. ,
James Mungro is always consistent
for the Orangemen on the ground, but it
will take a strong performance from quar-
terback R.J. Anderson to put the ‘Cuse on
top. I’m not sure if Syracuse can win, but

1 it should keep it. close.

GMAC Bowl I
East ‘Carolina vs. Marshall (-1)

It would only be right to close with a
MAC game, the one conference that I’ve
been ﬂawless in handicapping.

East Carolina (6-5) iscoming into the

game on a two-game skid as it dropped its,

last two to Louisville and Southem
Mississippi. East Carolina played incon-
sistently throughout the season. Before its
two losses, East Carolina defeated Texas
Christian and Cincinnati.

’ Marshall quarterback Byron Leftwich

- is the realdeal. He passed for 4,122 yards

this season, 37 touchdowns and just seven
interceptions.
He has a lot of weapons as wideouts

' Darius ‘Watts, Josh Davis and Denero

Maniot are all serious threats. ,
Watts has 18 touchdowns and more
than 1,400 yards, Davis has 961'receiving

. yards on the season and Maniot scored

nine touchdowns. When Leftwich is airing
the ball out, he can hand it off to Franklin
Wallace, who reached paydirt 10 times
this season.

I don’t see East Carolina keeping up

with Marshall’s arsenal.
