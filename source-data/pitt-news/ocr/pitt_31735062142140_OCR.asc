Rushing «Season

,New freshmen will see no elab-_

orate parties and dances this year
since Pitt’s twelve men’s fraterni-
ties have agreed to cut usual rush-
ing expenses and formality.

Revised rules accepted by the
Men’s Fraternities committee state
that, beginning yesterday at 8:30
a. m., freshmen may be entertain-
ed by the fraternities except that
they are not permitted to stay in
the house overnight and that no
musicians may be employed for
dancing purposes. .

Upperclassmen and transfers are
not subject to these rules and have
been rushed since the beginning of
school. Fraternities were allowed
to submit bids immediately to the
dean of men’s office in order to
pledge men as soon as possible.

They may submit freshmen bids
to the oﬂice of the dean of men be-

‘The summer quarterly of-- Pitt
magazine this year appeared a
month later than usual. Because of
the tri-semester plan, Editor Agnes

ward to enable -her writers to in-
clude news of interest about the ac-
celerated’ program. But it was worth
the wait. - «K.

The table of contents on page
one indicates that the University
is preparing men (and women) for
peace and war. The articles in this
news-ﬁlled issue of Pitt magazine
prove that.

There is a fairly complete dis-
cussion of ,the year round school
plan. After a general introduction,
the heads of the various schools or
departments tell their own particu-
lar set-up. " ’

Perhaps this article will make it
understandable to those working
people who ride the Fifth Avenue
cars why so many undergraduate
students are still carrying books
and rushing to make eight—thirties.

There is an article which re-
ports how all colleges are “girded
for total war.” An editor’s note
suggests that this article might
help students, friends, and parents
answer the much-heard question,
“Should the student enlist, go to
work, or continue his education?”

And there is an article about a

defense training program and one

about how the electrical engineers
are being trained for victory. Both

Concil To ~ecidc   n Summer Sports

 ii..’niiversity Sports Held This Summer,
ays ‘Athletic-iess Director Jimmy Hagan

,_ ELAINE KAH-N .
 there is one person who might
called upon to sympathize with
light of the Pitt News Sports
ter who hasino sports it would
'mmy Hagan, Pitt Athletic Di-
J tor,‘who, at present, has no ath-
etics. ' ' ’
Furthermore, Athletic Director
Hagan oﬂ’_ers little hope for re-
lieving the barreness of the sum-
er sports program. “This,” he an-
noes, “is the way things are go-
to be all summer. There will
I no sports despite the paradoxi-
fl fact that summer is the ideal
 me for swimming, golf, and base-
ball because "you just can’t have

ports without. players and with- —

t competition.”

“The player shortage is explain-
chieﬂy by the fact that the stu-
ents are accustomed to working
uring the ‘summer to earn money
‘ the school year, the accelerated

jfprogram notwithstanding. Many

dents are carrying outside jobs
ndfit would hardly be fair to ask
tudent to give up work in order

its go out of town to play a game

team has scheduled, even though
lalty to his team might cause

to do so. And, even if there
e no player-problem, there would

’ ,t1»ll,remain the problem of sched-

ling! opposition.

 There is nothing I would rather
‘-see than a summer schedule of
_ games, but‘ I believe that if you are
gigoing to do a thing, it should be

one right. And there would be
tile sense to having a team play
j_game- one Saturday, and then, if
p are lucky, playing another one
 ree weeks later.

Of course, we might play Penn
State at the Stadium one week, go
there the next, then play at the
Stadium again, or we might have
intra-squad games. But in either
case we would have no competi-

it tion which, after all, is the very

essence of sport. Some schools such

‘ I as Penn State and W & J are at-

tempting tocarry. out a summer
sports schedule, but with what Suc-
cess we have yet tosee.” .

On the future of fall sports in
general and football in particular_
Mr. Hagan is inclined to be more
optimistic. “Pitt,” he declared, “will
open the season as planned at Min-
nesota, unless something unfore-
seen comes up and a_rmy,o,'fﬁcials
refuse to let us make the trip. How-

ever, the fact that both the Army,‘

and Navy have athletic teams is
proof that they believe in and re’-
alize the beneﬁt of athletic com-
petition.

Gas rationing will, of course,
make it hard for schools in the ra-
tioned area, especially those schools
who, to ﬁll their stadiums, must de-
pend on people being able to travel.
Notre Dame has already given some
recognition to this problem by
transferring the Navy game, origi-
nally scheduled for South Bend, to
Cleveland.

Pitt is fortunate in being an ur-
ban college, for it has a great many
people to draw from who can reach
the Stad-iu)_.m _by street car‘a1ft'd bus.
This should be a big year for foot-
ball, for people have more money
to spend and seek escape from the
grim realities allabout them; That
athletics provide the needed escape
is shown by the unusually large
baseball attendance this year.

We will lose some players to the
armed services, but then so will the
other teams, so that any losses we

may sustain will be balanced by the

losses suffered by the other teams.

The spring program may be
something else again, although We
have already scheduled some base-
ball games. Certainly, offers of pri-
vate cars to transport the players
will be rather scarce. It used to be
that people actuallymaide applica-
tion to have their cars used, but
those days are gone, at least for the
duration.”

~ But all this, Director Hagan has-
tens to assure, is purely conjec-
ture. What will actually happen is
anybody’s guess. ‘

The ghost of previous Pitt foot-
11 power will appear in the Pitt

sent its “Super Military Spec-
cle.”. _ ' _ ‘
Except for track, no person, pow-
r, or sport was able to crash the
ome. of “King Football.” Back in
iosefdays even the -rougher events

nd. hammer ‘throw, were shunned

tootl that no one must touch the

mecca of sports activity. Both ﬁeld
events in track, and baseball have
been permitted the ‘ use of the
grounds. And now, the caissons will
be rolling on. ’ 5 ' -
Football games will have noth-
ing on this review. Plays will still
be called from the bench and re-
layed through the signal corps.
Blocking will be done by the cais-
sons and panzer divisions. The in-
fantry will do the running, and
the fans ‘will do the shouting.

As the boys in the back room
would say, “It’s signiﬁcant. It’ is an
indication of the revolutionary ef-‘-
fects of two great events, they rise
of thelUf.S. military might and the
decline of the Pitt football power.”

By appearing in the National In-
tercollegiate Golf Association tour-
nament played at South Bend, In-
diana, last week, Harry Simpson
and Bill Kramer set a University
record, for it marked the ﬁrst time
‘that Pitt has ever had two men
qualify for the annual m’eet.

And not since the days of Sam
~Parks, Jr., who later went on to
golf fame by winning the Nation-
al Open Championship in 1936, has
a Pitt player reached the second
round. This was achieved, this
year, by Harry Simpson, who ac-
tually had to be coaxed to play
because he considered himself too
‘sore and stiﬁ from a week of com-
pulsory physical education to play
golf. At any rate, all Simpson did
was to go out and shoot the best
_ golf of his life. 3

Simpson, ace from Alcoma who
'took runners up honors in the 1940
Pennsylvania State Amateur tour-
nament, qualiﬁed for the match
with a 152 and Bill Kramer with a
154. _A score of 155 or under was
necessary to qualify. There was
added honor in Pitt sending two
men to the tournament, for in all
only 64 men qualiﬁed for match
play. _ ' i ‘
Kramer won six twosomes and

‘ four foursomes this season, while

Simpson won six twosomes and
three foursomes.

This was the 45th annual Nation-
al Intercollegiate Golf Tournament,
the ﬁrst"biie being played away
back in“i397 by a small group of
undergraduates from Yale, Harvard
and Princeton. The N.C.A.A. took
over the‘ conduct of the tournament
in 193_9and it has become one of
the outstanding amateur competi-
tions in sports. Pitt’s own Jimmy
Hagan is;a member of the NIGA
National Committee. -

This year’s tournament was won
by‘George Tatum of Stanford, a
student who, by the way, is the
owner of a Phi Beta Kappa Key.

Advanced Red Cross
Course to Begin

The American Red Cross advanc-
ed course in ﬁrst aid will begin
Thursday afternoon, July 9. All
students desiring to take the course
are requested to register with Dr.

’ E. C. Reif of the pharmacy depart-
‘ment.

Lack of students registering for the summer session and
the addition of the engineering compulsory course in athletics,

may make, it impossible for the athletic oﬂiceto offer aecom.-, ,7
plete intramural program this summer, stated Frank Carver,_ ‘

head of the intramural department, last Tuesday.“

_“Unfortunately the Trees ﬁelds will only be available for ' '

a few hours each afternoon and the pool only ‘inthe ev'enin‘gs,’,‘i

said Carver, “but we will be only too glad tdoffer a.progra_m, if‘ i‘

there are enough students interest-
ed. We realize only too well the
need for exercise and recreation for
the students in school.”

It is extremely doubtful, at this
time, whether the independent stu-
dents o_r the engineers will take
active part in any type of intra-
mural program. The engineers
have quite enough to do with their
required Compulsory Athletic
course, while the independents are,
as yet, unorganized.

“At the present there is no deﬁ-

nite program planner,” said ‘Mr. .

Carver, “but next week after the
fraternities have their monthly
meeting we will know whether they

plan to participate or not. It is pos-_

sible for the aﬁiliated men to com-
pete in leagues of horseshoes, golf,
tennis, and mushball, and then to
have an indoor swimming tourna-
ment in the pool some evening.”
If the_fraternities do accept the
invitation of the athletic depart-
ment, the points would have no
bearing on the all-point, trophy.
Instead the officials suggested that
IF council appropriate money to

have cups and certiﬁcates for the

I winning houses. ‘

Medals that have been given out
by the athletic department, in the
pa.st, for individual championships .
are now out of the question because
of the war, but certiﬁcates will be
presented. ,

The hours that the Trees ﬁeld are
available for IF sports are all af-
ternoon Monday, ‘from 4:30 o’clock

on Tuesday, from 3:00 o’clock on ,'

Wednesday, and from 5:15 o’clock
on Thursday and Friday.

Organized into separate batteries
instead of one regiment, the first

ROTC drill with a full corps was

held last Wednesday. It was the
fourth drill of the summer for en-
gineering students.

For the summer, the ROTC has
been organized into four batteries
of three platoons each. Three
squads comprise a platoon. ‘

A total of 353 ROTC men are
registered for summer work with
the largest number, 156, belonging
to the sophomore,class. The fresh-
man‘ class has 63 men, the junior
class 81 /men, and the senior class
53. ‘

Riﬂes will not be issued for the
summer drills. Instead, emphasis
will be placed on close order drill,
extended. order drill, and military
calisthenics.

Uniforms, consisting of a ﬁeld
cap, belt, trousers, tie, and shirt,’
have not yet been issued. This will
be done when the ﬁeld caps arrive.
Each member of the corps will be
issued two complete uniforms, so
that one will always be ready for
use.

A new army officer, Lieutenant
John Finnerty, has been sent here
to replace Captain Dugan as in-
structor to the junior class.

Economic depression after this
war can be avoided, in opinion of
Dr. C. E. Ayres, University of Tex-
as economist. Dr. Ayres suggests as
America’s post-war slogan, “Come
on, Depression . . . we Licked Hit-
ler and We Can Lick You."

The economics professor said the
government’s immense spending
program will help redistribute the
wealth and thus furnish a hedge

against depression. Re-designing of -

industry to produce civilian needs,
increased by war-time scarcity, can
provide jobs for millions now tum-
ing their efforts to war production.
