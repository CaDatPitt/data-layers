Cruise Dry-Docked . 

Approximately 150 students
were planning -to spend Saturday
night‘ rocking and hopping on
the high seas of the Monogahela
on the Resident Student Associ-
ation’s (RSA). Valentine’s Day
Cruise. Instead, the"RSA' festivi-

‘ties were dry-docked because of
the ship’s broken generator.

“Despite the boat’s not mov-
ing,.I think the night was a big
success,” Vice-president Patti
Gafﬁgan said. “All of the stu-
dents will receive an undeter-
mined refund. We're in the
process of negotiating one now.”

Not only did the boat not
move, but the scheduled band
did not play. In spite of all the
problems,’ Gafﬁgan maintains
that the cruise was a success.

“It was all the people who went
who made the cruise fun...the
boat didn’t have to move,” she
said.

RSA will place a refund ad in
The Pitt News on Friday.

Tuition at Pitt will probably
increase next year as a result of
Governor Dick Thornburgh’s
recent budget recommendations,
but no one is certain by how
much.

Thornburgh announced last
week that state-related institu-
tions, of which Pitt is one, will
receive a 2 percent increase in aid
in the next budget, rather than
the 13 percent originally
requested by Pitt.

Dr. Jack Freeman, senior vice-
chancellor of administration,

attributed the 11 percent loss to
the current state of the economy.

“There is no money in the state
treasury to fund a 13 percent
increase,” Freeman said. “It has
nothing to do with our lobbying
effort or the view from Harris-
burg...What you request is often
in excess of what you get.”

Jim Wiggins, of the governor’s
Budget Office, said the state is
facing an extremely difficult year
financially and that the recession
has been deeper and longer than
most had expected.

He said Pitt is lucky that all its
aid is not being out, which has

Sta te’s Low Increase
Result Of Economy

happened to universities in other
states.

“We are not cutting aid to,
higher education,” he said. “The
governor has proposed an
increase of 2 percent.”

Although Pitt did not receive
the 13 percent, Wiggins said the 2 '
percent is a nice increase.

“We are giving the maximum
possible increase in a very tight
budget year,” he said. “We are
being able to avoid the real
decrease in state funding for uni-
versities that is occurring in other
states.

Representatives from Pitt will
voice their case before the Senate
Appropriations Committee on
March 4. Between now and then,
there will be Pitt administrators
and members of the Student
Government Board lobbying in
the Capitol for a higher increase.

Chancellor Wesley Posvar is
expected to reduce the request
from l3 percent to 9.8 percent, or
$7.7 million. This would bring
Pitt's budget to $86 million. This
is, however, “a very wishful
request,” according to Posvar.

“The 2 percent increase is not a
surprise,” he said. “Given the
economic condition of Pennsyl-

Morrison, Ignatow
Highlight Weekend

By CHRISTINA CLINTON

F
Award-winning novelist Toni,

Morrison will highlight the nation-
ally renowned Seventh Annual Uni-
Pittsburgh Writers’
Conference to be held March 19 and
20 at the Henry Clay Frick Fine Arts
Building.

The conference, “Aspects of Pro-

fessionalism, VII,” features a pot- _

pourri of writers, editors, poets and
publishers from around the country
gathered at one place to allow the
public to learn about the world of

writers through lectures, work-
shops, panels and personal
discussions.

Morrison, who is perhaps the
foremost black author of today, is
best known for her book, “Song of
Solomon,” which won the National
Book Critics Circle Award in 1977.
Her other books, “The Bluest Eye,”
“Sula” and “Tar Baby,” have also
received national praise and critical
acclaim. ,.

Joining Morrison as a featured
guest. is poet David Ignatow. A
recent recipient of the Bollingen
Prize and the Wallace Stevens Fel-
lowship at Yale University, Ignatow
is the author of many books of
poems, including “Whisper to the

Earth,” “Tread the Dark” and

“Selected Poems.” edited by Robert
Bly. Ignatow will read and Morrison
will speak at a special. Saturday
night program at Carnegie Lecture
Hall.

Also appearing at the conference
is New Yorker staff writer Susan
Sheehan. Sheehan won the National
Mental Health Association Award
in 1982 for her book, “Is There No
Place On Earth For Me?” a vivid
portrait of Sylvia Frumkin, a para-
noid schizophrenic who spent much
of the past 17 years in mental institu-
tions. Sheehan’s other books include
“Ten Vietnamese,” “A Welfare
Mother” and “A Prison and A
Prisoner.”

One of the most popular sessions

of the past, the “Selling What You_

Write” panel, this year features
Susan Margolis, the associate editor
of Playboy, Clifford May, formerly
an editor for The New York Times
Magazine and Geo and currently a
cityside reporter for The New York
Times; and Gary Fisketjon, senior
editor at Random House and editor
of The Random Review 1982, a col-
lection of the year’s best fiction,
essays and poetry. The panel will

SGB Refuses C|.ub’s
Funding Request

By PAUL CORREA

The Student Government Board
rejected a request by the Italian Club
to send two representatives to New
York to view the Vatican art trea-
sures, for which the club needed
$170.

At last week’s meeting, the board
sent the request back to the Alloca-
tions Committee for reconsidera-
tion, but the Allocations Committee
did not change its recommendation.

Board member Kathy Brown, in
explaining the board's action, said
that “art is a personal experience”
and that she could not see how that
experience could be brought back to
benefit the other club members.

Allocations chairman James
Shelton said the committee did not
change its recommendation because
the Italian Club could not say how
the club as a whole could benefit
from the trio. Only two members,
the president and vice-president,
were to make the trip.

vvrav

In other business, the board heard
a request by Masada, Hillel and The
Youth Institute for Peace in the
Middle East for Israel Week. The
total amount of the requestwas
$3,000. The Allocations Committee
recommended to the board that two
of the programs from that week be
cut. The board agreed to cut the
Purim party program because it was
believed to be_primarily a religious
/ social program, and the board has
a policy of not funding religious
programs.

The spokesman for Israel Week,
Zachary Grayson, argued that it was
a cultural program that fell well
within the board’s funding policies.
After a discussion, the board vote
ended in a deadlock. President
Mark Downs broke the deadlock by
voting to cut the program.

The second program out from
Israel Week was a wine and cheese
party. The Allocations Committee

For the second panel, “Close-Up:
The New York Times Experience,”
May and Mel Watkins, an editor at
The New York Times Book Review,
will discuss and answer questions
about what it is like to work for one
of the world’s largest and most pres-
tigious newspapers. .

The conference begins on Satur-
day, March 19, with literary agent
John Ware, a former editor for Dou-
bleday & Co., explaining his profes-
sion. Former TriQuarterIy editor,
Jonathan Brent, will follow, discuss-
ing “The World of Small Presses.”

Lorna Dee Cervantes, a recent
recipient of the Before Columbus
Foundation American.Book Award
for her book, “Emplumada” will
also be at the conference for a noon
reading.

Watkins will conduct a session on

‘book reviewing and will answer

questions about the art of book
reviewing.

On Sunday morning, a coffee and
conversation session is scheduled
with Margolis, Brent, Fisketjon and
Ware available to talk with students,
faculty and staff. Sheehan, Morri-
son and Ignatow will also conduct
workshops in the afternoon.

As an added attraction, Ed
McClanahan will speak about the 20
years he spent writing his first novel,
“The Natural Man,” recently pub-
lished by Farrar, Strauss & Giroux.

, The New York Times Book Review

said his book was one to watch out
for in the spring.
During the intermission of the

The Pitt News, Monday February 14, 1933'

Saturday night program at Carnegie
Lecture Hall, the Leo Koeberlein
Pitt News Award of Excellence will
be presented to a current Pitt News
staff member. Koeberlein, Pitt News
editor in l9_37, worked for The Pitts-
burgh Press for over 40 years and
served for 15 as executive editor. He
will be honored for his contribution
to the world of jounalism and will be
on hand to present the award named
after him. A $500 cash scholarship,
donated by Typecraft Press Incor-
porated, will be given to the current
Pitt News staff member who shows
the energy and talent to make it in
the journalism field.

Following the Saturday night
program, a meet-the-writers recep-
tion will be held in the cloister of the
FrickiFine Arts Building. Refresh-
ments will be served, and the public
will get a chance to meet and talk
with the writers.

Throughout the two days of the
conference, small presses from Pitts-
burgh and around the country will
be set up in the cloister of the Frick
Fine Arts Building,~displaying and
selling the books they publish.

The University of Pittsburgh Wri-
ters’ Conference was started in 1972
by Pitt’s English department.
Because of a lack of funds, it was
cancelled in 1976 but was success-
fully revived last year. ‘

Conferencejdirector Lee Gutkind
isean associate professor of English
at Pitt and is also the author of non-
fiction books and a filmmaker. His
first novel, “God‘s Helicopter," will
be published this spring by Slow
Loris Press.

Gutkind said he was pleased with
the success the conference enjoyed

last year and said- he thinks this
year’s will be just as successful.

We’re appealing to a broader
audience this year,” he said. “The
panels will bring in the people inter-
ested in selling their work and those
interested in The New York Times
These people will be accessible to
anybody who wants to talk with
them.”

Five students are working along
with Gutkind as “interns,” and he
said he would not have it any other
way. _

“I wouldn’t want to plan it if it
were just a straight faculty-staff type
thing,” Gutkind said.

In addition to the department of
English, the conference is also spon-
sored by the Student Publications
and Media Board, Pitt’s Office of
Student Activities, the Student
Government Board, the Pitt Pro-
gram Council, the Black Action
Society and the College of General
Studies Student Cabinet.

The Black Action Society (BAS)
decided to help sponsofthe confer-
ence after it learned that Toni Mor-
rison would be the headliner. BAS
tried to get Morrison for Black
Week, but did_ not have the funds.
Stephen Broadus, the adviser for
BAS, said the group is excited and
pleased that Morrison will be com-
ing to Pitt.

“My main concern is that we, as
BAS, become involved in a function
like this,” he said. “It’s very impor-
tant because there hasn’t been a lot
of exposure of black students in the
past.” _

Andy Smith, the director of stu-
dent activities, said he was alos
pleased with the success of last year's

    Ranks Second InThe Nation

By was corren

When people think of Pitt, a lot of
different things about the university,
such as the football team and the
Cathedral of Learning come to
mind. The thing that is not on the
minds of many is the second best
philosophy department in the
country.

A national rating survey named
Pitt as having the second-ranked
philosophy department nationwide.
Pitt ranked only behind Princeton.

The survey, conducted by the
National Research Council which is
affiliated with the National

Academy of Sciences, rated the ‘

department in 12 different catago-

ries and ranked it among 77 other _

schools. For a school to be ranked, it
had to have an on-going research
doctoral program.

The 1981 survey cost one half mil-
lion dollars and took two years to
complete.

Two important categories in the
survey were the quality of the
faculty—Pitt tied Princeton with

. 7l—and the effectiveness of the

graduate program, in which Pitt
scored a 72 behind Princeton’s 73.

The survey was completed
through questionnaires which,
according to Dr. Wesley Salmon,
the head of the Pitt philosophy
department, were sent to scholars in
different fields asking them to rate
their departments on different
scales. .

The survey was dominated by the
private Ivy League schools. The
anthropology, department was
ranked fifth, the only other Pitt
department to make the top l0.

7 “It's clear that publications in this
department are extremely influen-
tial to what is happening in philo-
sophy nationwide at the present
time," Salmon said. “Pitt is a defi-
nite leader in philosophy."

Another department added sup-
port to the ranking. The history and
philosophy of science department
scored 68 and 66 in the two major
categories. It was ranked in the top
ﬁve and also operates a center for
philosophy of science research. The

f-r1v-
.

  

"-Y‘rv-Q-~Q’i¢r-

     
 

' '3'” -; -.'

 
 

center is unique and attracts people
from all over the world to work in
this specific field of study, according
to Salmon. He said that the center
also produces books, lectures and
workshops that help make Pitt’s phi-
losophy department possibly the
best in the world.

To rank in the survey, a program
had to produce a certain number of
Ph.D.'s. The history and philosophy
of science department at Pitt was the
only one to even rank,” Salmon
explained.

“With the two departments com-
bined, Pitt has to be the top place in
the country to study philosophy at
the graduate level," Salmon said. He
added that the quality of Pitt's pro-
gram brings a select group of stu-
dents to the university, and the
success of the program has been
shown by 100 percent placement of
Ph.D. students during these hard
times.

The quality also trickles down to
the undergraduate level, according
to Salmon, in the form of assistants
and fellows.

i’—-vv-t.- ‘-t.\_.,‘V_.1_. ..__.

“Students get a much better edu-
cation here under TAs and TF5,”
Salmon said, adding that the faculty
is committed to teaching and every-
one teaches at every level. .

A new requirement that will
require all undergraduates to take
one philosophy course also stems

\ from the. character of the depart-

ment. . _
“The new set of requirements will

" put a breath in their education that

students didn’t experience before,”
Salmon explained.

The philosophy department at
Pitt is a ‘relatively new national
leader and emerged after the admin-
istration boostedthe program some
20 years ago in an effort to make the
Pitt program’ respectable, according
to Salmon.

Harvard is America’s oldest uni-
versity andhas had an ever growing
philosophy department, which
makes it quite a feat for Pitt to
develop the "program it_ now has,
according to Salmon.

Salmon said that it took a lot of

work and support to bring this pro-
gram -.-about and gave credit to the
administration for their assistance.
He added that it took resources to
develop the department that Pitt
has.

“Talented people have made it a
reality,” Salmon said. “The group is
very cohesive, the senior tenured
faculty don't leave this program."

The future of this program will
probably contain cuts in spending as
is the case with all the other humani-
ties departments, but Salmon said
that he is confident that the depart-
ment will maintain its high
standards- ’ ‘

Salmon said that philosophy was
at one time the central discipline of
study, all other studies were simply
an outgrowth. In the past, physics
and psychology were part of the field
of philosophy and since education
has grown, philosophy has under-
gone radical changes. This field of
study, however, is alive at Pitt, and,
according to Salmon, it will con-
tinue to grow and attract talented
people with the support it enjoys at
the presenttime. ‘

conference and said it was good for
the university.

‘‘It’s a benefit to both students and
the university because it’s a learning
experience,” Smith said. “It's also
good PR value because it brings the
univesity's name in association with
a very attractive type of program.”

Smith said he thinks this year’s
conference will be more successful
because the writers attending are
“maybe even higher than the people
last year” and because the public is
more aware of it this year.

“Sometimes something tradi-
tional like this can get lost in bad
economic times,” he said. “It's great
that this could be pulled "of .”

Gina Miller, an assistant student
activities director and an adviser for
PPC, said the conference was just
what the group was looking for in
terms of programming.

“We saw the value of the program,
the audience it reaches and, since it’s
not repetitive, it fits in with the kind
of programming we already have,”
Miller said.

Tickets for the conference will be

All people canlearn to build a
better world each day, and although
they may notéaiways succeed, they
_can’t stop tryiriig. ' ‘

‘ ‘This is the._ philosophy .of'Dr.
Robert C. Hickey, the acting dean of
the.School of Health Related Pro-
fessions, who said hisassignment‘

stresses the “acting” part of his title."

“My assignment stresses the act-
ing because it is not a caretaker job.

' It ;is an active responsibility‘ to

attempt ways and means, of ‘main-
taining and advancing excellence
while at .the same time recognizing
that .. the term is limited," Hickey
said. ‘

Hickey is responsible for supervis- ,

ing individual schools within the

university on such matters as aca- ,

demics and finances. The responsi-
bility of managing the university, he
said, can not be deferred to a later
date without harming the institute.
“I do this -in a ‘variety of ways,"
Hickey said. “First, I work closely
with the existing faculty and assure
that their goals concerning teaching
and research are being met. Second,
I am_available to the student popula-

1 tion, so that I can be well informed

of the goals that the students have
educationally and which concern
their career objectives.” . ,

Hickey said he provides an “open-
door” policy so students can become
acquainted with him and voice their
complaints, concerns and problems.
The school is a small one (under 500
students), and he provides accessi-
bility to the students without the
rigors of formality.

Depending on the size of other
schools in the university, most have
a. list of any number of associate
deans that come between the student
and the dean.

, Hickey came to _Pitt in 1969 as an
Assistant Registrar._Prio'r to his cur-
rent position, he also held the titles
of Special Assistant to the Vice-
Chancellor and Assistant Senior
for the Health
Sciences. -

Before he came to Pitt, Hickey
was a professor of philosophy at
LaRoche College. He said that the
logic and ethics he taught there
helped him in everyday life.

He agrees with the Roman philo-
sopher Cicero, who said that liberal
arts liberates the human spirit and is
more of a help than a hindrance.

“A good liberal arts education
goes with me on vacation, at work
and in communication with schol-
ars, students and staff,” he said. “I
would be less of a person, less
humane and less" interested in the

well-being _of society if ‘I hadn't stud-
ied liberal arts." _ -

After teaching at a small liberal
arts college" and later moving to a
large, comprehensive university,
Hickey said both type of institutes
are needed. A person can grow intel-
lectually, emotionally and matura-

tionally at both types of schools.

A large school provides self-
development and professional
development, while the small school
provides a greater opportunity for
faculty-student contact.

“This contact may or may not be

"beneficial to the student,” he said.

“The smaller, college merely gives
-more opportunity for students and
faculty to get together."

' Hickey can be seen around cam-
pus attending student functions such
as _fraternity parties, where he said
he can learn to better understand
students. He is an honorary member
of both Sigma Chi and Pi Kappa
Alpha fraternities and advises the
leadership honorary Omicron Delta
Kappa. '

_ “I believe in a balanced interest
between various kinds of studeflt
organizations,” Hickey said. “It is an.
important aspect to a student’s
career to have solid academic advice
and to be able to learn information
which will channel him to the many
sources he may not be aware of.”

‘ Hickey
should meet with students in a var-
iety of ways, rather than only when
there are problems that need to be
solved. That way, when a problem
does arise, there is already a rapport
that has been developed by the two
groups.

Communication between stu-

dents and faculty should be a two-
. way street, Hickey said. There are

"many inteirestedtfaculty who are
I’ never contacted by students, and
. some faculty members say that the

only time they see students is when
that student wants his grade
changed or there is a problem in the
class. Hickey said that students must
realize that faculty are people and
they can be cooperative.

“There is a barrier of age between
these two groups and sometimes
there is a reluctance to maintain con-
tact, but if both students and faculty
show themselves interested, they will
be able to work together,” he said.

Hickey has published several pa-
pers, including “The Roots of Faith”
and four short stories published in
the Josephinum Review. He has also
presented several papers concerning
such things as human subjects used

in research and grading systems in
colleges and universities.

“During the unrest of college cam-
puses in the early ’70s, universities
were having internal controversies
on the subject of grading,” he said.
“Somefaculty members disagreed
with all types of grading andthere
were cases of grade inflation where
were giving students
inflated grades which didn’t reflect

3 -the students’ work.” . -

This was being done, he said, i
defiance of the evaluation system.
From this controversy, such grading

, systems as pass/fail and credit/no

entry were born.

Hickey is fluent in five
languages—Latin, which he taught
during his term at LaRoche, Greek,
German, French and Spanish—in
addition to English. He has received
such awards as Summa Cum Laude
in the Auxilium Latinum (National
Competitive Latin‘Examination) in
1954 and has participated in such
activities as the University Council
on Interdisciplinary Programs and

_ the Provost’s Council of Deans.

He said the goal is to “build a
better world by identifying the most
promising talent and fostering
opportunity for that talent so that
tomorrow‘s leadership will be the
kind that will make a difference in
the world." ‘

Hickey said that tomorrow’s lead-
ership will come from the people
who are committed to excellence
and will work hard to achieve that
excellence. ‘ .

“Leadership ability is the ability
to persuade or convince others by
example to encourage others to fol-
law,” he said. “-Greater good is
achieved by groups when they work
collectively than when an individual
works in isolation.”

‘Hickey, ‘known throughout Pitt .

for his special contact and interest
with students, said he prefers_ to
remain in the shadows because the
human ego becomes an obstacle to
success.

“Often-times,’ one’s quest for the
limelight diminishes the commit-
ment to ideals and the commitment
to goals,” Hickey said. “So, I’d
rather stand in my own shadow as it
were, but be supportive of those who
walk in the limelight while I can be
free to use what talent I have to serve
and not be served.”

Hickey said he does not view stu-
dents so much as a collective cate-
gory but sees them simply as people.
It is not has important what program
a student is in as it is what type of
person that student might be.

may take longer.

“I wouldn‘t be surprised if this
thing isn't settled for a long, long
time,” Kobosky said.

Student Government Sets Priorities For The Term

By couems reams

The 1983 Student Government
Board (SGB) and several standing
committees" have been working

toward several priority goals for this —

year, including Law School Apti-
tude Tests (LSAT) preparatory
courses, standardized parking fees
for students, and surveys to ascer-
tain the level of student concern
about various issues.
One goal, according to SGB presi-
dent Mark Downs, is to implement
activities which are completely
directed toward Pitt students. The
SGB has already taken on thejob of
sponsoring a bus to the Civic Arena
for the Pitt-Notre Dame basketball
game, free of charge to Pitt students.
Downs said that it should boost
attendance for the game.

Board member Mindy Goldberg
has begun working on making
LSAT prep courses available on
campus for undergraduates at a low
cost. The courses would not be for
credit and would help sharpen the
test-taking skills needed for the
entrance exams.

Goldberg said that she has been
contacting different agencies to see if
they would consider coming to Pitt,
since Pitt only has one test-taking
skills "course that is available
through Kaufmann’s downtown.
One agency, The National Center
for Educational Testing, has
expressed an interest in becoming
more involved in the project.

“The need for such a course IS
fairly self-evident,” Goldberg said.
“In order to go to graduate school, a
student has to take the test and fig-

I iures show that those who take some

sort of prep course deﬁnitely have an
edge.”

Goldberg added that she has dis-
cussed the matter with Vice-
Chancellor for student affairs Andy
Smith who expressed an interest.
The next step is finding someone to

teach the course and to estimate the .

costs.

“Students will have to sign up for
it and pay a slight fee,” she
explained, “but nothing like the
$350-$400 fees asked by some agen-
cies. The fee would be somewhere
around $10 or $20.” Goldberg added
that the fee would be one way to
make certain that those students
who expressed an interest in the

A course were really serious.

_ Goldberg has sent out memos to
all the Law School faculty members
to see if they would be interested in
teaching the course. She is awaiting
responses.

Another area the SGB intends to
concentrate on is the strengthening
of freshman involvement in student
activities.

“We would like to see the upcom-
ing freshmen participate and

become more involved with the
organization,” Downs said. He
added that he realizes there is a lot of
student apathy. For this reason,
Downs considers the Emerging
Leader program a good start.

The program has been going on at
Pitt for some time. It takes about
200 freshmen and teaches them
throughout their first year aboug
leadership and helps them to
develop leadership qualities.

For the SGB, arriving at priorities
has been a process which still lacks a
lot of student input, but the board is
working on a way to change that. It
will be in the form ofa survey to find
out student concerns and what the
students are thinking, according to
Downs.

SGB representatives recently
returned from a conference in Texas
where Downs said he heard other
schools talk about communication
and the success they have had with
surveys. Downs added that a stand-
ing committee will be formed to go
about accomplishing this.

The board also intends to start
working on a way to have standard-
ized parking fees for Pitt students.

Downs said that nothing has been
done yet, but stressed that they are
working on it.

In other areas of concern, SGB
intends to build stronger ties with
the University Senate. This action
has been proposed to promote better
communication between the SGB
and the Senate with an overall
emphasis on the students, according
to Downs.

In addition, the Academic Affairs
Committee (AAC) is working on
distributing publications of teaching
evaluations and trying to make the
publication more accessible to the
student population. As it stands
now, teaching evaluations, which
are student evaluations of their
instructor’s performance, are still
not mandatory. One long range goal
of the AAC is to make them
mandatory.

""I'here are a lot of good ideas,”
Downs said, “and the important
thing is never to cut ourselves off
from input and suggestions.” He
added that it might be another
month before the student surveys
will be ready.

SGB Refuses Request

recommended that it be cut because
it was primarily a social program
and over one-third of the people’
invited were faculty members.

Grayson said the wine and cheese
were primarily to keep the people
there and were not the focus of the
program. After the board discussed
the request, it voted 6-3 in favor of
the program without the wine and
cheese. ‘

demic Affairs Committee reported
that the Course Evaluation Booklets
are being sent to the printer. The
Governmental Relations Commit-
tee re orted that it had sent repre-
sentatives to Harrisburg to hear
Governor Thornburgh’s budget
presentation.

In individual reports, Downs said
that he will be sending a letter to all
standing committees stating that
SGB committees must attend the
board meetings at least once every
two weeks to “strengthen ties

Downs also reported he will be
taking money from the SGB’s dis-
cretionary fund to pay for the stu-
dent buses to the Civic Arena for the
Notre Dame game. .

Downs said that he “learned a lot”
at the recent Conference of Student

Thirty-three to 53Istaff members
must be cut from university‘pro-
grams over the next five years, Dean
Jerome Rosenberg sajd at the last
Faculty of Arts and Science commit-
tee meeting.

Rosenberg said that there are a
number of reasons for the
reductions.

“Part of the cut is due_to the fact

,.  that for the last ﬁve or six years we

‘ ‘ x haven’t been able to keep up to
budget demands,” Rosenberg said.

He added, “We’ve beenlexpecting
for some time that changes in the
population of college students will
eventually lead to a reduction of the
size of the student body.

“Thishas not happened yet, but ‘
we’ve been expecting it.”

The growth period in the ‘60s and
‘70s resulted in the growth of staff,
he said. ‘‘It was easy then to open‘
new programs and expand faculty
size. Now the situation is reversing.”

Rosenberg has been working for
the past year on the reduction pro-
cess as well as on the specific details
involved in proceeding.

A Faculty of Arts and Sciences
committee was appointed last fall to

,- _ formulate a plan to help in the

4.1)‘ - reduction of Pitt staff members. The
committee consists of Max Lauffer,
John Neubauer and John Roberts.

“The committee members have
been working in order to plan for a
longterm range of faculty size,”
Rosenberg said.

The only department officially
closed has been the geography
department. “But some publicity
about the proposal to close an adult
undergraduate program has been
given,” said Rosenberg.

Rosenberg mentioned that faculty
will be involved in part of the deci-
sion mal(’ing\process..

'. )‘—\ Rosenberg wants the individual I
departments to “conform to the ‘
changing conditions.

“They’ll have to pay close atten- i

tion to the fact'that~they are going to I

Down
The
Drain

In about one month, the U.S. attorney
general will be receiving some interesting
guests—a protest delegation representing the
Fund for Open Information and Accounta-
bility, a group concerned with the Freedom
of Information Act (FOIA).

Since its passage in 1966, the FOIA has
been strengthened by several civil liberties
victories, but is now losing its bite at the
hands of a Congess that would prefer to keep
closed doors closed. Many backdoor amend-
ments have been proposed, and fortunately,
the worst of them—a measure introduced by
Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch—has been killed.
That bill would have imposed higher fees for
access to information under the act, in addi-
tion to granting corporations authority close
to a veto power over the release of documents
relating to pollution, worker safety and con-
sumer products. I

Apparently, these are subjects the details
of which are better left in corporate files, far
from the public eye. I

In the last session of Congress, the cards

were certainly stacked against the FOIA. Six .

amendments were passed, including shields
for doctors, the Department of Energy and
businesses. ’ A

For example, files concerning the produc-
tion of nuclear weapons, even if they are

I‘ unclassified, are exempt from the FOIA.

Information on hazardous products submit-
ted by manufacturers to the Consumer Pro-
duct Safety Commission cannot be released
without the filing corporation’s consent.

This activity is all consistent with ongoing,
attacks by the Reagan administration to re- ~

strict access to government information.

Such amendments do little more than

encourage government agencies to abuse

their privileges and powers to classify docu— _

ments. \
Unfortunately, Congress will succeed in

crippling the Freedom of Information Act"

until the American public realizes that its
right to know—and not just a 17-year-old
law—is going down the drain.

Letters To The Editor
Beyond The Rhetoric I

Dear Editor:

In reply to Mark Sindler’s article,

’ “Israel’s Battle to Survive," in the

J_an. 31 issue of The Pitt News, might

I say that perhaps Mr. Sindler
should refrain from writing on the
topicwof foreign policy, especially in

the area of the Middle East. Mr.

Sindler’s column is a blatant exam-

ple of misinformed, dogmatic and

ahistorical journalism. Mr. Sindler
should spend a little more time.
researching his subject before sub-

mitting it for publication in The Pitt

News. " ' ’

' I can sympathize with Mr. Sindler
in that I, too, before the Israeli inva-

sion of Lebanon, was a staunch sup- '
. porter oflsrael. Whenever I heard
. mention of the PLO, I immediately

thought of a “terrorist”organization
that thrived on blowing_up women

_ and children. but after viewing the
carnage of Lebanon, I began to.

rethink my unconditional support
for Israel. No longer was Israel the
“David," surrounded by the Arab
“Goliath.” In Israel, we have created
an imperialist power, bent on
expanding its territory for the Zion-
ist dream of the “greater Israel.”

NCAA CIosingDoors

I Dear Editor:

In the Friday, Jan. 21, 1983 issue
of The Pitt News, an article about
the National . Collegiate Athletic
Association (NCAA) tightening
academic standards for freshmen
was brought to my attention.

The article stated that in I986,
freshmen will need SAT scores of
700 or ACT scores of 15 to beeligi-
ble for NCAA competiton. It then
went on to say that blacks tend to
score lower on those tests than
whites. Since the SAT is racially
biased, this ruling would almost
close all doors to blacks who want to
get into collegiate sports. .

While I agree that academics
should play a very important role in
the NCAA, why should the SAT or
ACT score be the determining fac-
tor? Fewer blacks will be able to par-

ticipate in the NCAA. Should they '

be penalized because they don’t do
as well on these tests as others?

These students, _who really want toj:

A‘“v-I'}: Nuts.

While I speak out against the mis-
guided foreign and domestic policy
of Israel, it is not to be interpreted
that I am either anti-Israeli or anti-
Semitic. Israel does exist and should
continue to do so. No one’s hands
are clean in the Middle East-—
neither-_ Israeli, Palestinian nor
Arab. A - policy of . peaceful co-
existence should be established, and
the just national rights of the Palesti-
nian people should be guaranteed in
this policy. The Palestinians, much
like the Jewish people, have lived in
the Diaspora and have the same
right to a homeland. ' This would
encompass, with Israeli security in

mind, some parts of the original

Palestine.

Sindler’s assertion that the unrest

on the West Bank is a conspiracy on 
the _PLO’s' part is utterly absurd. V

Does one have to be a member of the
PLO to rebel against the conditions
of Israeli occupation? _When_the land
to which your family roots are

traced is expropriated underthe aus- _
pices of a biblical claim and your ,

village is razed for a colonial settle-
ment, is this not enough reason to
get upset? When your books are cen-
sored and you are subject to contin-
ual denial of your basic human

play, are going to be banned from
their sportjust because of one exam.

Who says that if a student scores
lessithan 700 on the SAT, he is going
to fail in college? O.K., SATs are
supposed to predict your ability to
do well in college, but do they? If this
were true, why did 35_ percent of
Pitt's minority students in the
University-Community Educational
Program (UCEP), who had been
previously rejected by the College of
Arts and Sciences, graduate and do
as well as any other graduate student
in thejob market? How well does the
test predict? I say not too well.

rights, and when your occupier can
keep you imprisoned without notify.-
ing anyone for 16 days, is this not
enough reason to get angry?

With regard to the PLO, does Mr.
Sindler know that in the interna-
tional arena more countries recog-
nize the PLO as the sole legitimate
representative of the Palestinian

people than recognize the existence ,

of the state of Israel? Beyond a mil-
itary organ, the PLO ran educa-
tional programs, established

, hospitals and is probably as demo-

cratic an organiza'tion as Israel
could hope to be. These factors are ,
not common knowledge, but they
can be obtained if one would just
look beyond the rhetoric and the
black—and-white panorama.

Might I ask Mr. Sindler——and all

those who apologize for the atroci- ‘
’ tiescommitted by the government of
‘ Israel—-to what limits are Israel’s
security and safe borders to be

extended? Do they encompass
annexing the West Bank, Gaza,
southern Lebanon and the Golan

I-Ieights? Do they call for Israel to be I

the main sﬁpplier of arms to South
Africa, El Salvador, Taiwan and a
host of other repressive and fascist
governments? Does Israel gain
security by training the ex-Somoza

national guard in Honduras and‘

supplying the government of the
born-again dictator of Guatemala,
Rios Mont, to the hilt? When stand-
ard Guatemala military garb is
Israeli-made uniforms, helmets and
Uzi machine guns and when Israeli-
trained Guatemalan pilots carry out
search-and-destroy missions on
remote Indian villages in Israeli-
made aircraft with Israeli bombs
and napalm, does this buy Israel
security?

Israel has become a surrogate of
the U.S. and will continue to be as
long as we remain the bloodline to
them and as long as the Israeli peo-
ple submit to these grave errors. But
the Israelis are a moral people, with
a long history of militant protest.
They, too, are tired of war and a
government unrepresentative of
their interests. They are awakening
and so are those who have been
fooled by the notion of the Israeli
“David." A just peace must be
found, in the interests of all parties
involved, or else a catastrophe
unparalleled may erupt. Mr. Sindler
should take this in mind, and do a
little research, refrain from “tunnel
vision“ and rethink his argument.

Everything To Gain By Peace

Dear Editor:

In the period of one week, three articles
have appeared in The Pitt News concerning
Israel. We, the undersigned, feel that it is no
longer possible for us to remain silent. As

 ‘Zionists, when Israel is maligned we are

maligned. We have read these articles with

much trepidation. The half-truths, outright

lies and, as is ever present in Thomas
Daniel’s articles, the anti-semitism, alarms
us.
Scott Rex writes at length about Judea
and Samaria—the West Bank. He accuses
the Israelis of violating the Camp David
Peace accords, U.N. Resolution 242 and the
Geneva Convention. We honestly wonder
whether Mr. Rex has ever bothered to read
the texts of any of these treaties and resolu-
tions which he so freely refers to.

In regards to the Geneva Convention IV
of 1949 and the I907 Hague Convention IV,
(which we are suprised that a person as

f), knowledgable of international law as Mr.

Rex is, would leave out) neither Eugene:

. Rostow, Sterling Professor of Law and Pub-
lic Affairs, Yale University and former
Undersecretary of State or William O‘Brien,
Professor- of Government, Georgetown Uni-
versity and editor of “New Nations in Inter-
national Law”, find the Geneva and Haige
Convention applicable to the West Bank.”
Even were they applicable, there is nothing
in these Conventions which find the settle-
ments illegal. '

In the words of Professor O’Brien, “It is
sometimes erroneously charged that bellig-
erant occupation law prohibits settlement by
nations of a occupying power in occupied
territory. No such provisions are to be found
in the Hague and Geneva Conventions.”

3 Should Mr. Rex choose to research this, as

he should have done prior to writing his
article, we are sure he will be very
enlightened.

In reference to U.N. resolution 242, there '

is no mentioniwhatsoever of settlements,
until such a time as permanent boundaries
are defined by a treaty: as stipulated in U. N.
Resolution 242, Israel has a right to remain
in Judea and Samaria as a lawful occupant!

Lastly, the Camp David Peace Accords
do not prohibit the building of settlements
on the West Bank, at least not the copy
published and distributed by the U.S.
Government. The final status of the West
Bank was left open to negotiation and for
good reason.

To whom does the West Bank belong? In
1948, Jordan invaded the West Bank and

«fl  annexed it in 1950 in violati_on of her armi-
‘ stice with Israel and of the U.N. charter.

Only two countries in the world recognized
Jordanian sovereignty over that area: the
United Kingdom and Pakistan. Not a single
Arab state recognized Jordanian annexa-
tion as legal. Judea and Samaria officially
have the status of “unallocated territory." It
must not be forgotten that Jordan was origi-
nally recognized as “Transjordan”——a state

I. on only the East Bank of the Jordan river.

The West Bank is an integral partof the

Palestine Mandate upon which a Jewish
State must be established. Therefore, when
discussing the West Bank one must be very
careful not to build a case on faulty
assumptions.

Concerning the present day settlements,
Judea and Samaria have always been the
heart of the land of Israel. It was only in 1948

that all Jews were expelled from Judea and-

Samaria. After the Six Day war, Jews began

  

 Opinion

to return to their old homes. They rebuilt on
land that was theirs. For the ﬁrst time in 19
years the Jews were allowed to visit and pray
at their holy places. In spite of an armistice
agreement signed by Jordan, guaranteeing

"free access to holy places for Israeli citizens

regardless of faith, no Israeli visitor, Muslim
or Jew, was ever allowed access to Jordanian
occuppied territory. Hebron, a once thriving
Jewish town whose 2,000 year old Jewish
Community was destroyed in the Arab Mas-
sacres of 1929, was “Judenrein"—off limits
to Jews until 1967. Werefuse to recognize
massacre as a
sovereignty.

legitimate claim for

—Page 9

The Pitt News, Monday February 14, I983

The future of J udea and Samaria is not up
to President Reagan or King Hussein or
Menachem Begin but rather to negotiations
by all concerned parties. One thing though is
certain: the Jewish People will never again
permit themselves to be refused access to
their holy places nor will they allow a
“Judenrein” Judea and Samaria—a West
Bank “purified of all Jews.”

As for Mr. Sindler, we stand astonished in
face of his statement, “As long as Israel co-
exists with its neighbors, the Arabs, peace
will never descend upon that segment of the
world.” Has he forgotten the Camp David
Peace Accords? Or does he feel that peace

By DOUGLAS HAMMERSTROM

Until recently there has been little vis-
ible activity by Christians regarding one
of the most pressing social issues--the
arms race. Of course, there have been
occasional condemnations by various
popes, and certain radical Christian com-
munities have practiced non-violent res-
istance at military bases and weapons
factories.

There has even been the highly public-
ized pastoral letter of American bishops
concerning the morality of nuclear deter-
rence and warfare, but as yet there has
been no popular movement among lay-

. people against an evil that seems in direct
opposition to the teachings of the man
they profess toifollow.

There are many roots to the passive
attitude of American Christians, not least
of which is the failure to distinguish
between the affirmation of traditional
conservative theology and the practice of
conservative politics. However, it is likely
that the major obstacle -to active opposi-

tion to the current preparation for war is
a confusion between the teachings S’ of
Jesus that command pacifism and the
teachings of St. Paul and others that per-
mit violence on certain occasions.

Over the centuries, the responsibility
of the ruler to “execute his wrath on the
wrongdoer” has been interpreted by the
likes of Augustine, Aquinas and Luther
to mean that in certain situations the
state must take up the sword to defend
righteousness and justice. The Jesuit
theologian, Francis Suarez, in the 17th
century proposed the idea that certain
wars may be just. This “just war theory”
is still widely held among both Catholics
and Protestants, and its essence is even
embodied in the charter of the Un:ited
Nations. Suarez put many constraints on
the just war, however. First, the war must
be waged by the sovereign lawful author-
ity. Second, the cause for making war
must be just, and third, the war should be
fought with moderation. Innocent civili-
ans were to be protected, and violence
was not to be in excess of that necessary
to curb the enemy and force him to make
peace. . I

It is debatable that these ‘arguments’
ever allowed for Christian participation
in making war, but today with the advent
of chemical, biological and nuclear wea-
pons, it is clear that a war cannot be
fought within the limits outlined by Sua-
rez. Helmut Gollwitzer from the Free
University of Berlin points out that, “The
weapons that Paul, Augustine and

Luther had in mind could still be adapted

tice. Once the decision had been taken to
apply force in the cause of justice, then
the use of riﬂe and culverin was as justifi-
able as the use of a sword or cata-
pult....The new instruments, of warfare
completely abolish all distinction
between combatants and civilians; in
fact, their very purpose is to decimate the
population of the enemy country. By
their very nature these weapons are
blind.” ,

It is time that Christians demand the
nuclear powers freeze production and
placement of new weapons at their pres-

negotiations for bilateral, confirmed dis-
armament. Many Christians have been in
the forefront for a decade protesting the
loss of millions of relatively unconscious
lives via inducedabortion. How much
greater the outcry should be against pre-
paring for the death of fully conscious
billions by trauma, burns and radiation
that will result from nuclear exchange.
It is time for American Christians to

participants in their nation’s war
machine. It is their tax money that buys
the weapons that will be used to inciner-
ate their brothersand sisters in Moscow
and Leningrad, Prague and Peking. Jim
Wallis, in a recent editorial, in So
journers states, “It is a great historical
irony that there were Catholics in the
bombing crew that dropped the bomb on
Nagasaki, the first and largest Catholic
city in Japan. The ground-zero target was
the Catholic cathedral. Among its vic-
tims were hundreds of worshippers and
three orders of Catholic sisters.”

It is time to examine our excuses for ‘
killing in the light of the words of Jesus.
St. Paul would -likely shudder to find that
his teachings had been used to justify
murder. Rather he would leave his read-
ers with other instructions. “Do not con-
form any longer to the pattern of this
world, but be transformed by the renew-
ing of your mind....Do not repay anyone
evil for evil....On the contrary, ‘If your

give him something to drink. In doing
this, you will heap burning coals ‘on his
head.’ Do not be overcome by evil, but
overcome evil with good.”

with the largest and strongest _of Arab
nations does not count? In 1948, five Arab
countries invaded Israel; in 1967, only four
Arab nations engaged Israel in war; and in
I973, the Yom Kippur War, Israel faced but
three adversaries. It is altogether possible
that Mr. Sindler is not refering to the Arab-
Israeli conflict in particular but the region as
a whole. We call on’Mr. Sindler to explain
how Israel had anything to do with ninety
percent of the conflicts in the Middle East! If
Israel were to disappear tomorrow, the
Soviet troops would still be in Afghanistan
and Iraq and Iran would still be killing each
other’s troops. There have been 15 inter-

Arab wars and civil wars; l9 heads of state A
and Prime Ministers have been assassinated '

in political murders; 30 successful coups
d’etat; and at least 46 more unsuccessful
ones in the Middle East over the last 25 years
having nothing whatsoever to do with Israel.

. The instability of the Middle East has very

little to do with Israel. If anything, Israel is a
moderating force, for it is the only thing
which can unite the Arabs.

_ Peace will come as soon as the Arab coun- .
tries realize that the Jews of Israel can not be

driven into the sea. As soon as they realize
that they have nothing to gain by war but
everything to gain by peace, they will sit
down at the negotiating table. Our only con-
cern is how many more people must die
before they reach this conclusion.

Israel has been accused of being intransi-
gent and indeed they are. They are intransi-
gent in their search for peace—in their
demands not just for a cessation of hostilites
but for a true and lasting peace. We support
this intransigence. We feel that the Ameri-
can public has lost sight of the most basic
fact of the Arab-Israeli conflict: for 35 years
since her creation, the State of Israel has
been continuously calling for peace——for
negotiations with her Arab neighbors and

for 35 years, with the recent exception of I

Egypt, not a single Arab nation has ans-
wered her call—not a single Arab nation has
even recognized her existence at any boun-
dary lines. Concessions come at the nego-
tiating table, not before. The pressure which
the U.S. should be exerting at this point,
should be on the Arab nations to bring them
to the table. Israel should not be penalized
for demanding a peace treaty with Lebanon,
for it is in everybody’s interest to have peace.
It seems so ludicrous that the U.S. Govern-
ment even’ considered suspending aid to
Israel because they want peace.

Though it pains us to dignify Mr. Thomas
Daniel with a response, we cannot help but
notice that he has toned down his Jew-
hating remarks from his letter to The Pitt
News in Sept. where he. states, “No people's
God would sanctify the Jews’ will towards

excessive wealth and profit,” to the standard *

anti-semitic accusation of Jewish control of
the media (Feb. 4), “The Jewish Establish-
ment in the news media uses prejudiced
cliches as a shield behind which to reap gain
over others.” Mr. Daniels, we only wish all
anti-Semites were as easily identifiable as
you and having seen no disclaimer, we are
left to assume that your views are shared by
the entire Progressive Student Network.

Panthers Score Lion Upset

By TAMMY ANDERSON

The Lady Panthers Basketball
team stunned the Penn State Lady
Lions 86-69 Saturday night at the
Fitzgerald Field House. The-Lady
Panther’ victory was a major upset,
as Penn State was ranked 13th c.om-
ing into the game. Pitt was
unranked.

A With victories this past week over
Cleveland State, Detroit and Penn
State, it would seem appropriate for
the Lady Panthers to receive some
national recognition.

“We have pulled some major
upsets this past week in our games
with Cleveland State, Detroit and
Penn State," head coach Judy
Saurer said. “It’s too early to tell if
those upsets will prove to give us a
national ranking, but they do prove
one thing—we are getting more
respect from all over in our play.”

Pitt proved once again that they
could I stay with any nationally
ranked team in the country. Penn

Sports  

State, which has been ranked all sea-
son, almost proved to be no obstacle
for the Lady Panthers—Pitt never
trailed the Lady Lions. In fact, the
Lady Panthers maintained at least a
seven-point lead throughout the
game.

The shooting percentages of both
teams tells the story'of the game. Pitt
shot 53 percent from the ﬂoor, while
Penn State hit only 38 percent of its
shots.

“No team can win a game shoot-
ing in the thirties,” Saurer said. “The
shooting percentages were a deﬁnite
factor in the game, but our victory

wasn’t just based on that.”

Saurer also attributed the team's ‘
success to the bench. ‘‘I’m very
pleased with the girls on. our team
who didn’t get to play,” she said.
“They were very enthusiastic and
excited for the other girls who were
playing, and are just enthusiastic
about the program altogether.
That’s what makes a team
successful——enthusiasm.” r

The victory was a deﬁnite team
effort. However, forward Jennifer
Bruce and Pam Miklasevich once
again stood out for the Lady Pan-
thers. Bruce wa_s unstoppable. ﬁn-
ishing with 34 points and eight
rebounds. Miklasevich also added
215 points and seven rebounds.
Freshman Kim Tirik contributed
10 points to the score, but turned in a
more _admirable performance in
breaking Penn State's well-known
zone press. Senior Lynn Love also
stood out for the Lady Panthers,
scoring SIX points and grabbing five
rebounds. _

The victory ups the Lady Pan-
thers’ record to 15-8. As the regular
season ends, it becomes more and
more critical for the Lady Panthers
to win. With the performances of the
last two weeks, the Lady Panthers
may be able to gain a play-off spot in
the NCAA tournament. But Pitt
must -look ahead to the upcoming
games with Georgetown and
Rutgers first.

The Penn State wrestling team
upped its season’s mark to 10-2-1-,
‘downing the Panthers 37-6 Saturday
at the Fitzgerald Field House.

The Panthers were hit hard by the

' sixth-ranked team in the nation, giv-

ing up three pins, a default, a major
decision and three decisions.

The loss drops Pitt’s record to 8-6
over, and 3-3 in Eastern Wrestling
League competition.

“I’m very disappointed,” Panther
head coach Rande Stottlemyer said.

“I don't mind getting our heads-

handed to us, but the way it hap-
pened made it worse. We should
have done a lot better.

“There were some bright spots,
Jeff (Jelic) and Kurt (Karanovich)

both did nice jobs, but we’ve got to A

see more bright spots.”

J/elic and Karanovich were the

_lone Panthers to register victories

Saturday. Jelic defeated Penn
State's Chris Bevilacqua 7-4 at 158
lbs., and Karanov_ich beat Joel
Johnson 8-5 at 1-90 lbs. \
Jelic gave up a takedown in the
first period to fall behind 2-0, but
seconds later escaped and took Bevi-

laqua down "to go up 3-2. Bevilaqua ,

escaped in the closing seconds of the
period to end it with a 3-3 tie.

Jelic bar-armed Bevilaqua most
of the second period but was unable
to score with it. With 27 seconds left
in the period, Bevilaqua injured his
shoulder and had to take injury
time.
escaped at the end of the period to go
up 4-3. .

In the third period, Jelic took
command, escaping to tie the score

When he came back, he _

at 4-4, then breezing through a duck-
under for a take down to go up 6-4.

Riding time advantage gave him the
final point.

A Karanovich, wrestling in his last
home match as a Panther, opened
with a takedown, then scored a tilt
for a nearfall to take a 5-0 lead in the
first period.

Johnson rode Karanovich for
most of the second period, but with
30 seconds left in the period, Kara-
novich scored a reversal to go up 7-0.

In the third period, Johnson
scored an escape and takedown to
narrow the score to 7-3. Johnson
tried cradling Karanovich for ya
nearfall most of the period but could
not score. Karanovich escaped and
Johnson took him down to end the
match at 8-5. \

It’s never safe to assume expected

outcomes in any type of sporting

event. What one expected before the
start of an encounter can be the out-
come someone else thought would
never occur. Well, the eight-team,
Pitt Invitational volleyball tourna-

ment had more than its share of

surprises.

Friday night, after an hour and a
half delay due to adverse weather
conditions, Pitt took Winnipeg to
five games before bowing out to the
fourth-ranked Wesman. That same
night, second-ranked Penn State
suffered its first loss of the season to
unranked Ball State and later had
Pitt take it to five games before
finally dispatching the Panthers.
Waterloo, ranked ninth in Canada,
finished, in eighth place after the
Warriors were given the shoo-in to
make it to the top four overall. Even
fifth-ranked York bowed out to
Ohio State in four games yesterday
and finished in fourth place. The
Buckeyes entered Pittsburgh play-
ing .500 ball.

On Friday evening, the Panthers

gave Winnipeg a scare but couldn’t a
keep pace with the experience the _

Wesmen had. The final score was

_9-l5,’._l5-5, 15-10, 11-15 and_l5-10. _

Panther coach Ray Reilly was non-

etheless impressed by the battle the
team gave Winnipeg.

“The guys played tremendous
ball,” he said. “We should have beat
them. It wasn’t that we had a break
in intensity, but (Winnipeg) is a little
better team; we just didn't have the
horses on the outside to put it away
is what it all amounts to.”

According to Winnipeg Coach
Dave Unruh, Pitt went the full dis-
tance because ofthe loss oftwo Win-
nipeg hitters, Paul Reimer and
Howard Epp, both of whom were ill.
Since the two were benched, the
Winnipeg squad had more than its
share of difficulty in running a
playset system different from the
one used with Reimer and Epp.

Unruh said Pitt is no doormat
team.

“Pitt is a tough team——they’re the
type that never says die,” he said.
“They have a lot of things going for
them in that this is their last Pitt
Invitational. That's the way it looks
now.

“I hope not because it is a good
tournament, and I think they figure,
‘Look, we’ve got nothing to lose,
let's go after these guys’. And they
sure went after us."

Later, Ohio State kept its engine
running at a steady pace, as the
Buckeyes easily rolled over the Pan-

_thers, l5-l0, 15-8 and 15-1 1. Proba-

Surprises Abound In Pitt Invitational

continued from page eleven

bly the big key to Ohio State's
improving its record was the team’s
past two matches with Pitt.

‘‘(Pitt) has one or two weaknesses
that we really keyed on,” Ohio coach
Jim Smoot said. “They had a couple
of guys that couldn‘t pass and a cou-
ple blockers that weren't blocking
extremely well, and we were setting
against them.

“We’ve picked up things from pre-
vious matches—-we know the
offense they run and what they like
to set in different formations, ”
Smoot said. “We knew that they
would stack their hitters to the left
side and mix up the postions from
where their hitter would come. Hav-
ing played them twice, our middle
blockers knew where their hitters
would be.” '

Smoot also praised Pitt’s better-
than-average offense saying that no
one can beat the Panthers when the
passing is,on. However, the Pan-
thers had been through an earlier
grueling Winnipeg match and
Smoot said that the disappointment
of losing carried over into the Ohio
State match.

Later, Reilly notes that the same _

fatigue was displayed by his players
in the Ohio State match. It was this,
he said, coupled with the Buckeye’s
height and experience that led to the

.' eventual Panther downfall.

These consecutive losses at the
start of the tournament may have
affected the Panthers’ play for the
rest of the tournament. As it turned
out, the stiff competition actually
turned out in Pitt’s favor.

“These guys are maturing quite

rapidly with the competition that
we're playing, " Reilly said. “They’re
getting closer as a unit everytime we
play. - . _
“They’re playing deuce ball with
the teams that are nationally
ranked.” '
A grudge match is all it took to
end Pitt’s short losing spell. Water-
loo had earlier defeated Pitt twice in
the Excalibur Classic and at Penn
State two weeks ago. In their first
game, the Panthers jumped out to a
7-3 lead, one that was never
relinquished—the team won 15-6.
Midway through the second
game, Coach Davegl-Iusson called a
second timeout with Pitt leading 8-0.
Obviously upset with the Warriors’
lack of effort, Husson did not see his
squad break through until Pitt was
already up by llpoints. The Pan-

thers later got the 2-0 edge with a

15-3 victory.

Husson replaced four of his six
starters, but Pitt conquered again,
15-1 1. Setter Dave Baird had his
usual outstanding game, with good
blocking up front by freshman Tim
Rakovan and vicious hittting from
the outside by Tony Zortea.

After the match, Husson refused
to comment.

' On the other end, Reilly was
beaming. “I’m pleased,” he said. “It
was a great grudge match, as I said
before. We knew we could beat
them. We just had certain things to
work on: serving was one of them. In
the third game, there was a bit of a
breakdown, but you'll always find
that in volleyball.

“If you win the first two,” he
added, “there’s always a tendency to
relax, thinking you will walk
through a third time. But we called
two timeouts and talked about it.”

Reilly pointed to the Panthers’
serving as the key in carrying them
over Waterloo. He said that the
squad took the Warriors out of their
offense because. of this, and that
everything went according to game
plan. Unless, of course, one facet of
the contest is not accounted for.

“One of the officials thought the
Panther (mascot) was distracting
him more than anyone,” he said.
“But I told him (Andy Srnilovici)
that he had done the NCAA finals in
front of 15,000 screaming fans last
year, and that the Panther upsets
him now?” ..

After Reilly attested that'Husson
did indeed “give up on his kids in the
third game,” assistant coach Rob

'Day found that Waterloo hadn’t
seen quite the same Panther team as
he had the last two times.

“(Pitt) has. played much better as
a team than when we saw them
before,” Day said.. “They don't get
down on themselves as much. They
are really playing together, much
better as a team, and I think they
were up for us—they -obviously
wanted us badly. It’s possible they
will play alot better the rest of the
season than anyone expects them
to.” ‘

Day explained that when his team
finds itself in a rut, it takes a long
time to climb out. Despite their
national ranking, the Warriors are
easily rattled.

Viewing the perimeter hit as a bet-
ter percentage shot, Day said that if
the opposing block is set a lot more
solid, the hitting will have to gravi-
tate more towards the sidelines.
Waterloo did a lot of that, with the
brick walls of Rakovan and Mike
Petock at the net. ‘

That was the type of aggression
that Day said stood out. “What
impressed me today was (Pitt’s) hus-
tle, real hustle on the ﬂoor.”

Sometime after the finish of Pitt’s
third game with Western Ontario
later that afternoon, one of the line
judges said, “They’d better not drag
this thing out to five games, or I’ll
die.” Indeed, that was the type of
volleyball show the two teams acted
out, with Pitt topping the Mustangs
after close to three hours of play,
14-16, 15-12, 15-6, 13-l\5,and 15-13.

The boring, listless match fea-
tured two even-matched teams,
-although a multitude of sideouts
throughout the match may have
proved that both had just started
high school players. In the first game
alone, seven sideouts were commit-
ted by both teams before Western
jumped out to a 1-0 lead. In that
game, Pitt had built a 13-8 lead, but
couldn’t hold it as the Mustangs
raced ahead for a 1-0 advantage.

Western coach Vaughan Peck-
man would say later, “In the first
game we won a couple of ralliesand.
had some lucky breaks and got back

into the match."

@

 

  

In the second game, Pitt down 9-
6, the Panthers squeezed some new
life into themselves and scored eight
unanswered points en route to the
15-12 victory. In the third game,
Peekman was given a technical
penalty by the officials for slamming
his clipboard on the floor and yelling
obscenities. He was not pleased with
the officiating. .

“I’m not going to say anything
negative, but my philosophy is to let
the official blow the whistle as little

as possible——let the boys play the"

game. I think we had too many whis-
tles. There was no effect on the
match’s outcome, though.”

After outside hitter Zortea put on
an exhibition in the third game, Pitt
fell short on winning any critical ral-
lies in the fourth and stretched the
match to five games. After a 4 p.m.
start, however, the match did not
conclude until 6:45 p.m.

“The boys were on the ﬂoor for
almost three full hours," Peekman
said, “but it doesn't matter what
game you’re in—that's a long time to
concentrate. For us, this was the
strongest match we’ve played for a
long time. Two weeks ago, the guys
couldn’t have done it
happened.”

, Reilly figured that his team was
effectively limited by Western’s slow
and deliberate pace, while Peekman
admitted that he runs so many dif-
ferent options that “it doesn't give
the boys enough time to adjust and
they get confused.” Reilly disagreed.

“It was really their strategy,” the
fourth-year coach said. “They
slowed us down and did things like
taking their time between plays and
spending a lot of time in getting
ready to serve.”

Either the Panthers were ready for
their Penn State match yesterday at
11 a.m. or the Nittany Lions could
not recover from the fact thay they
were vying for only a fifth-place
instead of going for a third straight
Pitt Invitational championship. In
any case, the Panthers made a game
of it, taking previously second-
ranked Penn State to five games
before losing, 15-1 1, 1-15, 15-9, 8-15,
and 11-15.

A “We were playing tough; we really
gelled as a team,” Reilly said. “It was
this kind of stiff competition that
makes you believe in yourself.

“As far as Penn State is con-
cerned, they weren’t playing well.
They were a little cocky and were up
in the ozones somewhere,” Reilly
said.

GAME SERVES: The same

Waterloo squad that entered ninth-
ranked in Canada, exited with an
eighth place finish in a field of eight
teams. Surprisingly, Ohio State
defeated fourth-ranked -York in four
games and placed third in the tour-
nament, despite its .500 record-
....Winnepeg defeated Ball State for
the championship, 11-15, 15-6, 15-
10 and 15-8. This is the second con-
secutive year the Cardinals have
placed second in the Pitt Invitation-
al....The Panthers raised their
record to 10-7-1.

Serving as a barometer of other
visiting coaches, Ball S_tate’s Don
Shondell expressed similar dismay
after realizing this would be his last
visit to the “best international, inter-
collegiate tournament” anywhere.

“I was really depressed,” he said.
“Pittsburgh volleyball is one of the

brightest spots and serves as a good
representative of this section of the
country. Just as Ohio State and Ball
State serve the Midwest, Pitt does
the same here in the East.

“And this is an emerging sport.
Pitt has the opportunity to get in on
the ground floor and go nowhere but
up. They have all the players, the
program is established; Ray’s done
just a great job. It’s really a shame.”

Hmmm, and what a tone on
which to end an otherwise excellent
weekend.

By MICHAEL EMERY

The excitement generated by
Pitt’s move to the Big East and its
recent success in the conference is
doubly satisfying for the Panther’s
brother-sister combination of Matt
and Pam Miklasevich.

Both were standout performers at

Franklin Regional High-School and __

re now making major contribu;

“fibns at Pitt.

Pam, a senior tri-captain on the
Lady Panthers, is averaging 17.4
points and six rebounds per game in
the Big East and 15.8 points and,6.6
rebounds per game overall.

“On the court, Pam’s the type of
player who is primarily quiet,”
Coach Judy Saurer said. “She listens
to the coaches and does what's asked
of her.”

Matt is a promising freshman who
averaged 22‘ points and 13.5

rebounds per game in his senior year

at Franklin Regional.
Coach Roy Chipman is impressed
with Matt’s play so far.

,2 . “He‘s doing well," Chipman said.
'-— zu here’s been a steady improve-

ment, and I think he’ll continuethat
improvement throughout his
career.”

Matt and Pam have had a lot of
support _and guidance from the-
outset of their basketball days. They
started playing together, along with
their brother Dave who is a student
at Carnegie-Mellon, under the gui-
dance of their father.

“Dad was very inspirational in
getting us all started and supporting
us.” Pam said. “He started a pro-

, gram for us when I was in ninth

grade and Matt was in sixth. It was
basically to work on the

,5 ndamentals~—dribbling, passing

a d shooting.” ' I
The work paid off for Matt“ and

Pam, both of whom came out.o_f__,.

high school” as Iieavily recruited
prospects. Some of the schools inter-
ested in_ Pam were North Carolina,
South Carolina and Kentucky, as
well as several small schools.

“I really wanted to go to school at
South Carolina,” she said, “but they
only offered a half scholarship. My
decision to come to Pitt was based
on their interest in me and it’s close
to home, which is nice."

Since coming to Pitt, Pam has
lived up to expectations. She’s

started since her freshman year and
has been an important member of
the Lady Panthers throughout her
career. Her only setback was a mid-
season knee injury in January of last
year, but she hasreturned to have an
exceptional senior season.

“She’s a steady performer,"
Saurer said. “On the stat sheet, she’s

always near the top in scoring and _

rebounding.” 1

Having Pam at Pitt helped Matt’s
decision to_ select Pitt, but it wasn‘t
the only reason.

“She just said to ‘go where you
want,’ ” Matt said. “But having her
at Pitt helped my decision. She told

me of her experiences at Pitt so I 5

knew a little of what to expect. My
brother Dave is at CMU, so we’re all

‘ pretty close.”

Matt is satisfied with his progress

2 since coming to Pitt. -
“I come from a high school that
didn’t teach a lot of basketball,” he
said. “Since coming to Pitt, I‘ve

learned a lot. I think I'm playing

better now than I ever have."

Matt and Pam go to each other’s 2
games to help each other as much as

possible.

“He comes to my games and tells
me what I did wrong, and I do the
same for him,” Pam said.

The similarities ‘between the two
are striking, in both appearance and
playing styles. Their respective
coaches express a similar apprecia-
tion for their court sense.

“He’1l definitely be an asset for us
in the future,” Chipman said. “He’s a
smart player; I think that’s the big-
gest thing. Having a smart player

‘ like Matt can only help."

Saurer said the same about Pam.
“During timeouts, Pam asks the
heady questions, which is the sign of
intelligence," she said. “She’s a
smart player, which every team
needs.” —

The resemblance may continue as

Matt tries to achieve what Pam has .

accomplished in her career at Pitt.

While Matt’s major contribution
maybe in the future, he has shown
potential this year.

“He has not been a starter,” Chip-
man said,'“but he has gotten some
playing time, and he’s contributed in
those situations when he has been in.

“I think Matt will get better and
better,” Chipman added. “It’s just a
matter of gaining experience with
college’-level competition.”

Storms In Villanova  

By SCOTT DELLETT

The ‘Panther basketball‘ team
managed to ﬁght one of the worst
blizzards on record to face Villanova
Friday, but Pitt could not stop the
Wildcats, who stormed past the
‘Panthers 78-65.

There was more than the snow
dropping outside the ~ Villanova
Field -House. Center John Pinone,

(1-'-kplaying his last game at the Cat

House, scored 25 points, shooting
8-for-l2 from the field and 9-of-ll
from the foul line. It was also the
shooting of guard Dwayne McClain
that turned a close game into a com-
fortable win for the Wildcats.
McClain scored 10 of his 14 points in
the second half, while Villanova
pulled into a 13 point lead.
Meanwhile, Panther forward
Cldye Vaughan scored 22 points,
despite the Wildcats defense, which
‘keyed on him.
“We~played hard and executed
well except for a five minute period,"
assistant coach Seth Greenberg said.
 In the last meeting at the Fitzge-
rald Field House, center Andre Wil-
liams only scored two points and
was constantly intimidated by Vil-
lanova forward Ed Pinckey. Friday,
Williams missed the only two shots
he took, but his problems stemmed

from othegg

I  "i (‘.6

“Andre got into’ foul trouble
early,” Greenberg said. “He never
got into the flow of the offense.”

“Andre has improved his defense
this season. He has been pressured
to play bigger players, and it has
taken its ‘toll on his offense.”

Vaughan and forward Trent
Johnson, who played the entire
game, experienced fatigue in the
later stages. However, there wasn’t a
good time to rest them.

“When it was the right situation to
substitue, both said they weren’t
tired,” Greenberg said. “We cer-
tainly‘ have the players on the
sidelines."

Pitt was prepared for the blizzard
- sort of. Coach R_oy Chipman was
able to find a hotel near the Villan-
ova campus. But the problem was
getting back to Pittsburgh.

“We stayed overnight at the hotel
and were scheduled to take a 10:50
ﬂight out,” Greenberg "said. “We
waited for the airport to open, and
when we found out it wouldn’t open
until after 6 p.m., we took a bus
back.”

“We didn’t get back to Pittsburgh
until I l. Fortunately, we don‘t have
a game until Wednesday against
Notre Dame."

It is always exciting to watch a

‘ budding prospect rise to stardom.

To a large extent, Panther gymnas-

tics coach Frank D’Amico knows
the feeling.

Matt Peters, who was the l982
Pennsylvania state all-around
champion on Parallel Bars, has, in
his freshman year at Pitt, become a
major contributor to the (7-1)
Panther team.

, ‘‘l’ve never had a freshman score
above 9.0 in the parallel bars until
Matt, and he does it with consis-
tency,” D’Amico says. “He is a very
important part of the team.”

The parallel bars is not the only
event in which Peters competes. He
has been scoring 9.0 or better in two
other events—-the floor exercise and
the high bar.

I The Pitt News, Monday February. 141983

In a recent meet with lndiana _

State, Peters placed first in the
parallel bars (9. l ), second in the high
bar (9.2) and third in the floor exer-
cise (9.3).

To score 9.0 or better in three dif-
ferent events during one meet is
quite an accomplishment for any
gymnast, especially so for a
freshman.

These scores arejust an indication
of what D’Amico believes may be a
great future for Peters.

“Matt has thepotential to com-
pete on the United States national
team,” D’Amico says. “He is small
and flexible. He is a quick learner,
but also has the ability to cope with
the learning and missing that gym-
nastics entails.”

Despite the overflow of optimism
displayed so often by his coach,
Peters is determined to keep things

“Things will come_ when they
come,” Peters says. “ljust work hard
every day. I don't feel a need to look
too far into the future.”

Though Peters is reluctant to set
any personal goals, he says that the
team's chances to go far this season
are. “pretty good.”

Peters does have one weakness.
He is a little short on strength. Con-
sequently, he doesn’t compete in the
rings, an event that is based on the
strength of the gymnast.

From a team standpoint, Peters
sees himself as filling an important
role. ,

‘‘I’m usually the lead-off man in
most events,” he says. “I think it is
important for me to score well in
order to set the proper tone.”

fourth with 173.60. ,.

At the team competition Friday
night, the Lady Panthers were able
to achieve their highest totals this
season on vault, unevens and ﬂoor;
However, five falls on beam proved
fatal to the Lady Panthers.

“We could have beat out Arizona
if we had stayed on the beam.”
Coach Donna Sanft said. “We had a
consistent meet on all other events,
but beam is often the determining
factor in a close meet, whoever hits
gets the scores, we didn’t hit.”

Junior Karen Martin turned in
another strong performance, both in
the team and individual
competitions. '

Martin captured ninth place in theﬁ‘-1”

placed sixth on bars with a score of

Senior Babbie Flock also helped
the Lady Panthers, scoring a total of
35.40. In individual competition,
Flock was able to capture sixth place
on vault with a score of 8.95.

Freshman Kristy Pieters also
turned in a fine performance despite
a nagging knee injury. She scored an

' excellent 34.40 in the all-around and

captured thrid place on ﬂoor exer-
cise with a score of 9.2. Pieters was
the only Lady Panther to place in the
top three in individual competition.

As a first-time performer at th .
Cat Classic, Pieters wasn’t sure how
she would fare in the competition.

“I didn’t think I would do as well
as I thought I would, just coming off
an injury,” she said. “But the meet
itself had a very relaxing atmos-
phere. Everyone was friendly and all
the gymnasts seem to be ‘ having
fun.”

“The meet is always a pleasure to
participate in,” Sanft agreed. “Not
