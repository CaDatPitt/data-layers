Joumalism’s

By SETH VLUBOVE

David‘ Halberstam, the former
Pulitzer Prize—winning_ reporter for
The New York Times, was walking
through a dingy hotel in Ann Arbor,
Mich., one recent night. He was car-
rying his suitcases, stuffed with both
clothes and the material he had col-
lected while researching his latest
book on the demise of the economy

' in the Detroit auto industry, when a

disturbing image ‘came to him.
“I thought to myself, ‘My God,
there he is, American journalism’s

Willie Loman (the main character in 7
Arthur Miller's play Death of a ‘

SaIesman).’ I mean I’m 47 years old

i V and I’m lugging all this shit, and you

know, it was like Willie Loman

strikes again,” Halberstam recalled. '

As a _self—described “surviving
infantryman in American journal-
ism,” Halberstam, who will be a key-
note speaker at Saturday night’s
special writer’s conference presen-
tation in Carnegie Music Hall, has
been in worse places ‘than dingy
hotel rooms in Ann Arbor. His jour-
nalistic career has taken him from
the offices of the Harvard Crimson
to the streets of Saigon,’ and

. recently, to the locker rooms of the
Portland Trail Blazers.

Halberstam is one of America’s
leading journalists and authors,
something confirmed as far back as
1964 when he was awarded the

Pulitzer Prize for his reporting from '

Vietnam while working on The New
York Times. Since then, he has
spent all his time writing books,

including: The Making of a Quag- , 7

sey of Robert Kennedy (1969), The

Kinnell:The State Of The Art T

By TCHRISTINE WILTANGER

The task of poetry, in an idealized .

form, would be to turn all doctrine
back into a metaphor of heaven,
according to poet Galway Kinnell.
Kinnell, recipient of the 1975
Award of Merit medal and author of
Mortal Acts, Mortal Words, will par-
ticipate in the Sixth Annual Univer-

sity of Pittsburgh Writers".

Conference, March 20-21, 1982.
Kinnell, who has also authored sev-
eral other books of poetry and
prose, will speak Saturday night_at
7:30 pm. in Carnegie Lecture Hall.

According to Kinnell, in an ideal-
ized form, poetry “would take upon
itself the task of restoring the world.
It would replace religion, the way we
think of religion, get rid of all the
doctrine and turn it back into mysti-
cal terms.”

_ The poetry would speak, said Kin-
nell, the way ancient religions
spoke. “For example, the notion of
heaven, the notion of afterlife, would
be turned back into a parable as it
originally was,” he said.

“The parable was a certain meta- H

phor of a moment, fully lived in our
lives, rather than a doctrine. Sothe
task of poetry would be to turn all
doctrine back into a metaphor of
heaven.” .

That is the noblest function of

 

 
  

David Halberstam
Best and the Brightest (1.972), and
The Powers That Be (1979).

Halberstam had arrived in Viet-
nam in mid—1962 ‘after an assignment

A in the Congo for the Times when he‘

was -in his late 205. As Halberstam
describes it, getting the Pulitzer was
a lot easier than getting his editors to
assign him as the first full-tirne cor-
respondent for an American news-
paper in Saigon. He got the

poetry, ‘Kinnell said, but it is one that
he feels isn't quite possible in today’s
world. He believes that contempor-
ary poetry is currently in a state of
ferment. . ,

‘Whether it will come to a boil, or
go cold, who can say? There are a
lot of very talented-and "intelligent
people writing, so my expectation is

» that some young writer will‘ burst

forth with magnificent poetry that
we haven’t been able to predict.
That’s the nature of magnificent
poetry—it catches you by surprise.”

‘Kinnell believes that there are cer-
tam elements missing in contempor-
ary poetry. .

“For example, the song has gone

out of poetry ,” he said.

The problem, says Kinnell is not
necessarily meter in  “lt’s
song through various ways. Whit-
man does not use~meter, but his
poetry is full of song,” he said.

“Free verse is capable of song
too. It is just that in its contempor-
ary usage, free verse is rather ﬂat
and prosey,” he said.

One way.of putting more song
into poetry, according to Kinnell, is
through politics. . .

‘Political slogans often plod,
according to Kinnell, but political
discourse is healthy in poetry—-

“Something which sings in poetry, in ‘

your ideology,” he said. “It also
often -plods.”

“I think it’s good that there is polit-
-ical discourse in poetry,and quite
natural ‘if you think about it,” he

7‘ said. “Poetry has a political base to

it, has some sort of political view to
it )3 .

. Despite_ his views on poetry and I

how it is affected by politics, Kinnell
denies being in the tradition ofWalt
Whitman. “Well, I think the tradition
that Walt Whitman imagined or
developed—the notion of _the poet
who was both writing at the very
highest level and at the same time
representing the masses——has sort
of ended.”

The notion, according to Kinnell,

was just a fantasy of Whitman’s, a -

fantasy that Kinnell ~himself'——
despite his own efforts—knows is
impossible.

“Poetry is a minority art,” Kinnell
said. “lt is foolish to indulge. in those
fantasies in which poetry, as an art,
is recognized by the people, and
speaks for them.” _

According to Kinnell, poetry
doesn’t capture the masses. He said
the attributes necessary to enjoy
poetry——an exceptional amount of
attention, a desire to flow with
things—aren’t common traits.

When Lee Gutkind joined the
faculty of Pitt’s English department
in 1970, he was surprised at the
number of students and faculty who
were unaware of how the publishin
world operated. ‘

Gutkind—an accomplished writ-
er whose articles have appeared in
Sports Illustrated magazine and.
whose books include Bike Fever
and The Best Seat in Baseball, But
You -Have To Stand!— decided to
remedy the situation by founding
The University of Pittsburgh Writ-
ers’ Conference in 1972. s

“The conference was a big under-

taking, but I thought it was essential

for students to meet and interact
with working professionals- from the
hub of the writing world,” Gutkind
said. “From my own experiences at
the Breadloaf Writers’ Conference
in Vermont, I knew there were
things you could learn from writers

and editors that educators could ,

never teach you.”
Some 10 years and five conferen-

ces later, Gutkind’s undertaking has I

evolved into one of the nation's
most comprehensive writers’
conferences. .

Former guests of the University

of Pittsburgh" Writers’ Conference’
. have included journalists Helen

Thomas, George Plimpton and
Nicholas Von Hoffman; fiction writ-
ers John Knowles (author of A
Separate Peace) and Herbert Gold;
poets Maxine Kumin and Diane
Wakoski; and former articles editor
of Esquire magazine Lee Eisenberg
and senior editor of The Atlantic
magazine C. Michael Curtis.

' This year’s conference, “Aspects
of Professionalism VI,” scheduled
for Saturday and Sunday, Mar. 20

— and 21, in the Frick Fine Arts Build- -
ing will again feature some of the ’

country’s foremost writers, poets
and editors. ,

Journalist David Halberstam,
former reporter for The New York
Times, whose keen sense of Ameri-
can social and political trends

earned him a Pulitzer Prize, will
I headline the conference along with

Galway Kinnell, recipient of .the
1975 Award of Merit Medal for po-
etry from the American Academy of
Arts and Letters.

At a special Saturday night pro-
gram in Carnegie Music Hall at 723.0,
Halberstam——'author of The Best
and the Brightest and The Powers
That Be——-will speak on his own
journalistic experiences and the
process involved in creating a mon-

tumental project such as his 800-

continued from page one
As a “sort of third-rate history
major,” Halberstam shunned aca-

demics in favor of journalism and.

work on the Crimson as managing
editor. — _
“It wasn’t that academics weren’t
goingto get me a job,” he said. “I
didn’t connect with it. It didn’t seem
as real. Journalism seemed real in
some odd way. It seemed exciting.
I’m not a person who can learn theo-
retically, and I couldn’t sit there in a
class where a guy was giving a
course and a lot of reading and tell-
ing us things. But if I was out there
covering something then I’d stay up
night after night reading stuff. I can't
work in the abstract.”
From -Harvard, where he had
worked for two summers at The
Hartford Courant and done part-

‘ - time work for The Boston Globe,

Halberstam went south in 1955 to
the Daily Time Leader in West
Point, Miss. As the only reporter on
the smallest daily in Mississippi, Hal-
berstam witnessed the birth of the

civil rights movement, though he

wasn’t permitted to report on it.
Because his editor shied away

from controversial civil ‘rights

issues, Halberstam turned to. free-

 lancing for The Reporter magazine. —

Persons attending the conference
will have the chance to meet all of
the writers at a reception. which will
follow immediately after Kinnell’s

I reading Saturday night in the Frick

Fine Arts Building.

Also planned as part of the con-
ference are three panel discussions
designed for audience participation.

I “Selling What You Write” is sche-
duled for Saturday from 2-3:20 p.m.
in the Frick Fine Arts Building with
literary agent Ellen Levine, Rolling
Stone magazine managing editor
Terry ' McDonell and Jane Rosen-
man, an editor ,at E.P. Dutton. Inc.
who edited John Irving’s latest
book, Hotel New Hampshire.

According to Gutkind, the “Sell-
ing What You Write” panel has been

JoumaIism’s

a liberal publication for the times. In
a recent article for Esquire maga-
zine, Halberstam commented:

“It was my first breakthough; I
imagined (quite inaccurately) the
great newspaper editors of America
watching a lively magazine like The
Reporter, reading the piece and
thinking, ‘Halberstam, that young
kid down in" Mississippi, let’s keep
him in mind.’” , -

After continuing conﬂicts with his
editor at the Times Leader over his
coverage of civil rights issues, Hal-
berstam left Mississippi for a four-
year stint with the Nashville
Tennessean, and from there went to
The New York Times. He worked at
the Times for six years, serving as a
foreign correspondent in the
Congo, Poland and Vietnam.

Halberstam’s Pulitzer for his Viet-
nam coverage resulted largely from
his ability to get through the institu-
tional and administrative accounts

of the conflicts to the actual story of
what was occurring. The thought of
a.Pulitzer, however, never entered
Halberstam’s mind until he was
actually awarded it. , .

“To a certain point you know that

. that’s the big. story of the year and

you’re the targeted guy. of the year.
But that’-5 net    its about

ferences and has been one of the

.most popular and best-attended

events.
- “With this kind of panel the

audience can Iearn—both by listen-

ing and asking questions—how the
publishing system works and the
surest ways for getting material pub-
lished,” Gutkind said.

McDonell, who.also founded Out-
side magazine, will be available to
talk to students’ on a "one-to-one
basis on Sunday morning at 10 a.m.
on the second floor of the Frick Fine
Arts Building.

“Small Presses,”

from 3:30-4:50 p.m.»in the Frick Fine
Arts Building and will examine the
growing significance of small
presses, , Panelists include Stan
Lindberg, editor of the‘ Georgia
Review and Robert Pope, editor of
Akros, a literary magazine pub-.
lished by the University of Akron.
“Small Presses” originated during

’ the planning of the 1977 conference,

and according to conference’s coor-
dinator Paul Mathews, the panel

proved to be “a good forum for
throwing out ideas.” *

“The panel-—as was the rest of
the conference—was well worth my
time and I made a few contacts who
were instrumental in, helping me

' later on,” said Mathews, a Pitt grad- '
_ uate who has worked for publishing

houses in New York and Boston
and is currently involved in Pitts-
burgh’s publishing field.

The third panel, “Women In Pub-
lishing,” is, scheduled for Sunday
from ,1-2:20 p.m. and will evaluate
the different roles women play in the
publishing world. Featured panelists
will be Jeff Schwartz of Alice James
Press, the, women’s publishing co-
op, and Janet Stemberg, editor of
The Writer On Her Work and pro-

You’re sitting there and you’re so
caught up in the struggle that you’ve
got with the administration and the
generals and the military, that that’s
what you’re involved in,” he said.
Halberstam’s latest book, The
Breaks of the Game, is the account
of the 1979-80 Portland Trail Blaz-
ers’ season. Like his previous
books, Breaks of the Game is in
Halberstam’s epic style, in this case

is also an accomplished film-maker.
Her award-winning film, Virginia
Woolf: The Moment Whole, will be

second ﬂoor of the Frick Fine Arts
Building. 7 ,

Tickets for the conference are
free to all Pitt students, faculty and
staff, and cost $4 for those outside of
the university. Tickets are available
at the student union ticket office
located in the main lobby of Schen-
Iey Hall.

According to Gutkind, both stu-
dents and the university on a whole
will benefit from “Aspects of Profes-
sionalism VI.” .

“The existence of the conference
strengthens the university’s writing
program and might directly influ-
ence, registration in the writing pro-
gram,” he said. “The conference
gives students a chance to benefit
from the direct contact with work-
ing professionals.”

Seth Lubove, a. senior English
writing major who is the student
-coordinator of this year’s confer-'
ence, agrees. -

“Students interested in writing
will be able to learn more in five
minutes of talking to David Halber-
stam about developing sources, ‘
than in any writing course,” said
Lubove, who has been putting in 20
hours a week since January working
on publicity for the conference.
“The conference also offers stu-
dents who aren’t pursuing a career
in writing the chance to gain some
insight into the different aspects of
the publishing world, aswell as the
opportunity to listen to some inter-
esting discussions, lectures and
readings.” ’

A number of Pitt graduates who
attended the past’ conferences as
undergraduates plan to attend this

tracts and the media on the team
and the individual players. Writing
the book, he said, “was a picnic.It
was fun and the people I wrote
about by and large liked it.” ‘
Previous writing ‘experiences
have not always been such a picnic
for Halberstam, as in the case of The
Powers that Be, a 771-page book
about the history of the major Amer-
ican media organizations. Ironically,

“I like the fact that I’m smarter now than I was
10 years ago. When I go out and do things, if I
don’t know .about It then, I’m going to learn

tomorrow.”

about the travails and experiences
of a losing professional basketball
team.

Halberstam structured the book
on a series of anecdotes about the
players and coaches, interspersed
with brief biographies and accounts
of the effects of money, tough con-

the major problems did not arise in
the actual writing of the book.

He first sold the idea for The Pow-
ers That Be to Random House in
1973 and received a $200,000
advance. Unfortunately, the
advance was shortly. depleted and
the book was saved only when the

year’s conference. One of them,
Pitt’s University Times editor Nancv
Brown, recalls that the most advan-
tageous aspect of the conference is

the fact that students have the

chance to meet personally and lea
from a high-caliber group of
professionals.

“One of the greatest benefits is
that students get the chance to-talk
to professionals who are at the peak
of their respective careers,” Brown
said. “Neither the classroom nor the
internship setting offers this oppor-
tunity to make such contacts.”

Former conference student coor-
dinator Matt Kennedy——now a
reporter for The Pittsburgh Press-—
describes the conference as “an
opportunity to reawakenthe excite-i
ment about writing.”

“The conference’s emphasis is 0
both craft and spirit, which provides
the university writing community
with an opportunity ‘to exchange
ideas with leading writers in con-
crete terms and theoretical terms,”
Kennedy said. “It is a unique oppor-
tunity for students to augment the
classroom, and just as important,
the conference is a lot of fun.”

The fact that the conference will
provide -local writers, editors and
publishers an opportunity to in-
teract with one another is another
benefit Gutkind strongly stresses.

“Pittsburgh has developed a thriv-
ing writing and publishing world of
its own, but often the different seg-
ments are isolated from on
another. The conference will intro-
duce students to this world and,
more importantly, possibly bring the
segments together,” Gutkind said.

Planning the 1982 University of
Pittsburgh Writers’ Conference
began back in September when the
Media and Publications Board-
consisting of students,‘ faculty,
administrators and outside journal-
ism professionals—took the first
steps to revive the conference after
a four-year hiatus. -

The majority of work involved in ,

setting up the conference and pub-
licizing it has been done by Gutkind

and six students, while funding and,

support has come from the Media
and Publications Board, the Office
of Student Activities, the Pitt Pr
gram Council, the ‘College of Gen-
eral Studies Student Council, and
the Department of English..

Although there is no tally on the
number of tickets that have been
distributed within the university for
the conference, Gutkind said that
he has received “a” very positive
response” and the fact that the stu—.
dent interest and support has been
enough to revive the conference
after four” years “is very
encouraging.”

Book of the Month club bought it for
$300,000, of which Halberstam
received half. Halberstam also lost
his original editor and had to switch
publishers to Alfred A. Knopf, a sis-
ter publisher of Random House and
publisher of The Breaks of the
Game. Finally, there were the critics
to contend with——both professional

critics who complained the boow

was rambling and at times dis-
jointed, and those who were men-
tioned unfavorably in the book. _
Halberstam’s reponse to the crit-
ics: “If— people don’t like a'book like
that, then to hell with them. My job
was to write as good a book as I
could on the rise of the media.”
Despite a commitment never to
return to daily journalism, Halber-
stam still calls himself a journalist

. ” rather than an author.

“I go out and report and keep
going around knocking on doors
and ringing phones,” he said.

“I like what I do. I’m quite content
to do it and I don’t.want to go b '
and be a daily reporter. lt’s not in th
cards. I like learning and I like the
learning process. I like the fact thatl
think I’m smarter now than I was 10
years. ago. When I go out and d0
things, if I don’t know about-it then,
I’m going to learn tomorrow."

Barry Hannah had it tough from
the very beginning.

As a Southern writer, Hannah
might have been expected to follow
in the footsteps of William Faulkner
and Katherine Anne Porter, but
instead he developed his own style
of writing. It is not the usual slow,
Southern rhetoric of Faulkner and
Porter, but one Hannah ‘himself la-
bels “rapid-fire English.”

Hannah will talk about his fiction
at the Sixth Annual Writers’ Confer-
ence. His reading is scheduled for
Saturday, March 20 at 10 a.m. in the
Frick Fine Arts Building.

Hannah was born in Mississippi in
1942. He graduated from Mississippi
‘College and received his M.A. and
M.F.A. in English from the Univer-
sity of Arkansas. His first novel,
Geronimo Rex, was published when
he was only 28 .

Geronimo Rex takes place during
the 1950s against the backdrop of
the birth of the civilrights move-
ment. The main character, Harri-
man Monroe, attempts to come to
grips with his feelings about blacks
through his wild imagination. He
ﬂoats from one impersonation to
another. At one point in the novel he
is a child-prodigy trumpeter and at
another time he is an amateur gun-
slinger whose hero‘ is the Apache
Indian, Geronimo.

B"ar|y”"I-Ian ii

Hannah attributes that early suc-
cess to his graduate work. One of
his instructors introduced him to a
literary agent who expressed an
interest in Hannah’s work. Shortly
after that, Geronimo Rex was pub-
lished. Hannah said the contacts
that are made in college are impor-
tant to a writer’s future.

“Some people give up so easily
because publishing is so hazy-
looking,” Hannah said. “Everyone
needs someone who will help them.”

In 1978, a collection of Hannah’s
short stories were published and

entitled Airships, which won the
Arnold Gingrich Esquire magazine
prize. Several of the 10 stories in the-
book deal with events which

occurred during and after the Viet— '

nam War. some take place in’ the
South. Hannah said thereis a big
difference between writing a short
story and writing a novel.
“The short story is sort of a
sprint,” he said. “The novel is a long,
boring’ kind of a mile.” ‘

Hannah prefers writing short sto-
ries to novels because he is impa-
tient and a short story gives him
“instant gratification,” He said a wri-

-John Wideman Returns

By MARGARET ATTWOOD

When he was growing up in
Homewood, his ambition was to
become a basketball star, but now,
more than two decades later, he is
returning to Pittsburgh as one of
America’s leading black authors".

John Wideman will speak at the
Sixth Annual University of Pitts-
burgh Writers’ Conference on
March 20-21 about his experiences
in the Homewood section of Pitts-
burgh and how he has translated
these experiences into his fiction.

Author of A Glance Away, Hurry
Home, The Lynchers, Hiding Place
and Damballah, Wideman’s work
has been reviewed by the New York
Times Book Review, The American
Poetry Review and The Black
American, Literature Forum.

Educated at Peabody High
School, Wideman attended the Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania, where he
received a Rhodes Scholarship to
study at Oxford. He attended the
University of Iowa’s Writer’s Work-
shop and upon completion took an
assistant professorship at the Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania. He
advanced to a full professorship at
Penn before moving to the Univer-
sity of Wyoming.

Wideman returns to Homewood
every year to visit his parents and
friends. Although he says his memo-
ries are pleasant, he is outraged by
the gradual deterioration of the
community.

“Growing up in Homewood gave
one a sense of community,” he said.
“We were a very closely knit group
but all of that has changed. Most of
the positive communal aspects have
been ravaged by drug traffic, lack of
jobs and deteriorating physical cir-
cumstances. I’m worried the Home-
wood I knew will disappear.”

In his work, Wideman draws

upon his experiences in Homewood
to raise important questions about
black community and family life.
“The beauty of Homewood is
important,” he said, “because it
reflects black family life. When I was
little and walked down the street to

Homewood

munity.”

play, my grandmother didn’t worry;
she knew that someone was looking
out for me.

“The family is precious to black
people and that’s threatened today.
It’s not that black people have
changed but economic pressures
have increased. It’s amazing that
black people do as well as they do
considering the pressures.”

Wideman has tried in his fiction to
underscore the things he considers
precious in black communities like
Homewood, in order to preserve
them.

Wideman has found that being a
black American is a positive expe-
rience. In 25 years he has lived
through a progression that has
taken others generations.

  As Leading   Black Writer

“Historically immigrants would
start at the bottom of the socio-
economic strata as laborers, the
next generation would-own shops,
and the following generation would

- become educated professionals. I

started on the bottom and in 25
years ended up where it would have
taken three generations,” he said.
During his childhood, Wideman’s
father, who waited on tables and did
odd jobs, taught him there were no
limits to what he could do. His
heroes were the athletes he heard
about on the radio. As he got older,

' he began to imagine himself making

it as an athlete.

Norm Frey, Wideman’s basket-
ball coach, still teaches at Peabody
High School.

“John was a very positive young ,

man,” said Frey. “He was very
bright but never flaunted it. He was
very popular——the president of the
senior class. That was in a time
when blacks didn’t hold office in the
school.”

Wideman said that he was very
lucky to have had teachers who
were very demanding and who gave
him a lot of personal attention.

The novelist, who still loves
sports, decided in high school that
athletics would be his ticket to suc-
cess, but entering the University of
Pennsylvania on a basketball schol-
arship proved to be a frightening
experience for him.

“The culture shock was tremen-

dous,” Wideman said. “There were
seven black men and four black
women out of a class of 1,200. The
rules weren’t clear to me and I had
to constantly watch and listen. I
might be the only black at a dance. I
didn’t know whether to stay and
socialize, if it was okay to dance with
anyone, or whether I should leave.”

Wideman learned that he had to

writing a short story——he finishes
many of his stories in a week.
Although Hannah does not pat-

tern himself after any particular wri-
ter, he admits to being influenced by
Walker,'Percy. I

“I grew up with Faulkner and his
rhetoric. Some Southerners are
paralyzed by it; they think it’s the
only way to look at life,” Hannah
said. “Percy loosened me up and
now I don’t give a damn about the
old, Southern rhetoric.”

Hannah said the term “Southern”
is “dead and misleading.”

Wideman said. “You must maintain
your integrity and know who you
are. Coming from Homewood gave
me values to turn to that people who
make it in the world can’t give.”

The racial, economic and per-
sonal struggles that Wideman has
experienced are themes he uses in
his books.

Woodene Merriman, who
reviewed Wideman’s latest work in
the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette Book
Review, said, “His books are very
enjoyable and particularly interest-
ing because they are set in Pitts-
burgh. He uses the language of the
people and his characters are very
authentic. Professionally speaking,
he is a very good writer.”

In Wideman’s novel Hurry Home,
main character Cecil Braithwaite is
a highly educated black man who is
caught between two worlds, the
white business world and his cul-

His Own Tradition

One of the biggest differences
between Southern writers and oth-
ers, Hannah said, is that South-
erners are more familiar with his-
tory, and therefore can write about
it.

“We keep in touch with our family ‘

and our roots,” he said. “When I was
in California, the sense of history
was almost non-existent.” Ironi-
cally, he was awarded the William
Faulkner Prize for Geronimo Rex.

Hannah has been teaching fiction
writing at the University of Missis-
sippi since January and previously
taught at the University of Iowa. He
advises young writers to have
patience and try to get as much
experience as possible. It is rare
when writers get recognition when
thev are in their early twenties.

He said that writers usually begin
to get some recognition by the time
they reach the age of 27 to 30
because by then they have the confi-
dence and experience that is
needed for success.

Chuck Kinder, an English instruc-
tor at Pitt, uses some of Hannah’s

work in his fiction classes. He said ‘

he has used a few stories from Air-'
ships and most of his students seem
to enjoy the works.

— Kinder, a personal friend of Han-
nah’s, said he enjoys the elements of
‘black humor and satire that are evi-
dent in most of Hannah’s stories ad
novels. Kinder _ called Hannah’s
latest novel, Ray, about a doctor in
-Vietnam, “very fine.”

“Cecil is not really me,” said
Wideman, “although in him I’ve
used parts of my mind and expe-

rience. He faces a problem that,I’vel

resolved. Often I’ve externalized in
writing, working my way through
problems. If you’re going to write
about anything you must go through
the experience first in order to draw
from your experience.”

At the writers’ conference, Wide-

man will talk about his experiences
in Pittsburgh’s Homewood, why he
considers them valuable enough to
write books about them, and the
methodology he uses in doing so.

“Being black in America is a rich
experience, even with all the prob-
lems,” said Wideman. At the writ-
ers’ conference he will tell us how he
communicates and seeks to pre-
serve the beauty of the black cul-
tural heritage that began for him
right here in Pittsburgh’s
Homewood.

In the foreword to Carolyn
Forche’s book Gathering The
Tribes, noted poet Stanley Kunitz
wrote, “Carolyn Forche’s poems
give an ' illusion of artlessness
because they spring from the simpl-
est and deepest feelings, from an
earthling’s awareness of the sys-
temic pulse of creation. The poems
tell us she is at home anyplace under
the stars, wherever there are field or
mountain, lake or rivers, persons

who stir her atavistic bond-sense.” I

Poet Carolyn Forche, 31, is origi-
nally from Detroit; she is one of the
guest poets attending the 1982 Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh’s Writers’ Con-
ference, scheduled for March 20
and 21. She will give a reading of her
poetry the first day of the confer-
ence. In 1976, Forche won the Yale
Series of Younger Poets Award, one
of the most prestigious awards a
poet can win, resulting in the publi-
cation of her first collection of
poems, Gathering The Tribes.

Forche’s second book of poetry,
The Country Between Us, was pub-
lished just this month by Harper &
Row. The book, a compilation of five
years’ work, was chosen for publica-
tion through the Academy of Ameri-
can Poets’ Lamont Poetry Prize for
1981. ,

For the settings in her first book,
Forche used the Pueblo Indian vil-
lage of Taos in New Mexico, as well

as southern Michigan, British

Columbia, Kiev and Czechoslova-
kia. She has studied the foreign lan-
guages- of Spanish, Tewa (Peublo
Indian), French, Serbo-Croatian
and Russian. ”

The poem, Burning The Tomato
Worms, remembers Forche’s
grandmother of Slovak origins:

She took up her hoestick,
watched the moon

She could hear touch chopped
wood

Her room smelled of advent
candles '

Cake ﬂour clung to her face

Forche talked about the compari-
sons that could be drawn between
her two collections of poetry.
“(There are similarities, but) not
thematically, and not in terms of my
voice. ‘I think my voice as a poet has
changed considerably over the
years. That was a very young book,
Gathering The Tribes. Both books
arise out of experience: they both
record the experience innate in my
own development, both as a artist
and as a human being. The poems
come from that in the books.”

Argentinian exile and journalist
Jacobo Timerman wrote of The
Country Between ‘Us,“Latin Amer-
ica needs a poet to replace the man
who represented in his writings the
beauty, sufferings, fears and dreams
of this continent: Pablo Neruda.
Carolyn Forche is that voice.” Sev-
eral of the poems in the new collec-
tion come from Forche’s experience
as a journalist and human rights
investigator in El. Salvador.

“I became a journalist because of

recent interview from her Charlot-

tesville, Virginia home. Forche
worked as a journalist and human
rights investigator in El Salvador
between 1978 and 1980.

nalism, although I’ve always wanted
to do all forms. of writing. I went to El
Salvador and felt compelled—
m_orally and ethically-——to report
what I had seen there,” Forche said.

“So I taught myself; to become a

 

journalist.” _

Forche’s work on El Salvador has
appeared in The Nation and The
Progressive, as well as other publi-
cations. She shared information

with, human rights organizations.

 

 

Some of the poems that appear in
The Country Between Us appeared
in Antaeus, The American Poetry
Review, The Virginia Quarterly
Review and The Atlantic Monthly,

among other literary magazines and -

journals. Since completion of work
in that country, where she met with
the late religious leader Monsignor
Oscar Romeo on many occasions,
the last time a week before his
death, Forche has written about and
spoken on El Salvador, “all over the
United States. I have also been writ-
ing a novel about El Salvador and
have taught in prisons in Alaska.” In
an article that appeared. in the
July/August issue of The American

, Poetry Review, Forche pointed out
thatshe had approached journalism
and poetry as two separate “mental-
ites.” According to Forche, her
experience as a journalist in El Sal-
vador verified what she had read in
the work of other poets——the notion
that social or political issues did not
necessarily have to be divorced
from her art. .

“I had read poets before (El Salva-
dor) who did not feel that the social
or political were inappropriate sub-
jects to address. Not that they were
striving for the political, but they
wouldn’t avoid it,” she said. “Poets
who addressed the (human) condi-
tion, I would say, are international
poets like Anna Ahkmatova, the
Russian poet. I have been influenced
by her, Nazin Hikmet, Miguel Her-
nandez and others.There are a
number of Eastern European and
Latin American poets who have
influenced me,” Forche said.

Forche began writing poetry as a

E‘ child when she was nine years old.

, She notes that she “realized its
t seriousness at about the age of 22.”‘
She graduated from Justin Morill
College, an experimental branch of
Michigan State University.

One of the poems that appears in
The Country Between Us, Return,

- won the Pushcart Prize VI: Best of

the Small Presses. Forche writes for
her friend Josephine Crum about
her return to the United States from
El Salvador: -

Josephine, I tell you I have not
rested, not since I drove those
streets with a gun in my lap, not
since all manner of speaking has
failed and the remnant of my life
continues onward.

“I think I’ve read most of what’s
been put in print on El Salvador. I
have one room just for the storage
of that material.” said-Forche about
her work with the subject. When
asked if she would continue to
pursue work as a journalist or
human rights investigator, Forche
said that she would, if the opportun-
ity once again arises.

“If, once again, I feel compelled to
speak, to report on something, to
make a documentation of some-
thing, I will do it.” She is looking
forward to the writer’s conference.

“Oh yes. I read in Pittsburgh a few

experience for me, because the
audience was very receptive. I like
Pittsburgh. I’m comfortable with
Pittsburgh. The people are like the
people that I’ve always lived and
grown up with,” Forche said.

Is Alive and Well  

 In  
Pittsburgh

By BETH LEWIS

Although many editors and~writ-
ers are coming from out of town to
the Sixth Annual University of Pitts-
burgh Writers’ Conference, ’ the
city's own flourishing presses indi-
cate that publishing is also doing
well in Pittsburgh. V »

Small local presses such as Slow
Loris, a completely nonprofit endea-

vor, a commercial enterprise called .

Quinn-Gallagher and growing
recognition for our own University
of Pittsburgh Press are indicators of .
Pittsburgh’s healthy publishing
climate. ’

Run by Tony and Patricia
Petrosky from their home, Slow
Loris started by publishing individ-

A ual poems on single sheets of paper,

much of which was hand—made. The
Petroskys began publishing the first
ten issues of Rapport, a literary
magazine ‘devoted to poetry, in
1972.’

In 1978, Rapport was superseded
by Slow Loris Reader, which regu-
larly includes fiction, reviews,
essays, photos and drawings and
as poetry.
Recent issues featured an excerpt
from Lee Gutkind’s novel God’s
Helicopter, and fiction and poetry
by Eve Shelnutt, both members of
Pitt’s English department, and fic-
tion by Pittsburgher Natalie
Petesch, a winner of the Iowa Short
Eiction Prize.

. ~About 1979, Slow Loris Press

egan publishing books, both hard-
cover and softcover,» and chap-
books, small collections of poems
the size of a pamphlet or brochure.
“This is often the wayfor people
who do'n’t have enough poems for a
book to get some attention,”
Petrosky pointed out. “A chapbook
often precedes book publication.”
-«Lynn _ Emanuel, another faculty
member, had her first chapbook,

* Oblique‘ lzight, published by Slow

Loris, whose latest chapbook,
Ancient Wars, was written by Paul
Zimmer, director of the Univeristy
of Georgia Press. One of the first
books the Petroskys published was

  The End of the Ice Age, a collection
’ of poems by Ed Ochester, director

of Pitt’s writing program.

Slow Loris also has to its credit
books by some of the most
respected poets in the country,

including William Stafford, David .

lgnatow and Richard Hugo. ,

"We try to alternate bodks by
people who are well-known with
those by authors not so well-
known,” Petrosky said, explaining
that the financial risk of publishing
an unknown is thus offset by the
;more assured income big-name
~ writers can bring in.

Typesetting and printing for Slow
“Loris Press is done by Hoechstetter

.“;:}«?rinting Company in Pittsburgh, but

the books are distributed
everywhere——by three distributors
in the U.S., on the East and West
Coasts and in the Midwest, and by
.Blac_kwells lnternational in England,
France and lndia. Slow Loris books

have been on display at such places
as the Library of Congress, ‘Brown
University and the New York Public
Library.

As- a nonprofit corporation, Slow
Loris is funded largely by grants
from the Coordinating Council of
Literary Magazines and the
National Endowment for the Arts. A
recent grant from the NEA will allow
the Petroskys-to publish two books
of fiction, one of which will be Lee
Gutkind’s novel. The support of the
NEA, Gutkind pointed out, gives
Slow Loris and the city of Pittsburgh
a great dealof prestige. ,

But Tony Petrosky, who teaches
at Pitt’s School of Education, said
that it’s not money or prestige that
motivates Patricia and him. “You do

A it more because you believe in the

work of a writer.”

At Slow Loris Press, it’s just the
two of them, often working into the
wee hours of the morning-which
provides a clue to the name of the
press. . i

“.‘Slow Loris’ comes from a noc-
turnal lemur," Petrosky explained.
“They work at night and sleep dur-

. ing the day...that’s sort of us.”

Other nonprofit publishers in the
local area include two feminist
presses, Motheroot Publications
and KNOW lnc., Quinn-Gallagher
Press and a “different” kind of publi-
cation, the Mill Hunk Herald.

Headed by Anne Pride, executive
director of Pittsburgh Action
Against Rape_,_Motheroot publishes
fiction, poetry and nonfiction by
feminist authors, as well as-the quar-
terly ’Motheroot Journal, which
reviews small-press books of inter-

T est to women.

KNOW, lnc., ‘an organization
founded in 1969 by a group of Pitts-
burgh NOW members, has printed
or reprinted -more than 450 items
promoting feminism.

Calling itself ‘-‘an experiment in
democratic journalism,” the Mill
Hunk Herald is run out of the home
of Larry Evans (a steelworker) and
Leslie Evans (a teacher). It’s a quar-
terly forum for the stories and opin-
ions of all working people. Anyone
can write for the Herald and all sub-
scribers may attend editorial meet-
ings to help choose articles to be
published. Funding is through con-
tributions and subscriptions.

Quinn-Gallagher Press is “also
nonprofit, but that’s not what we
planned on!” said half of the partner-
ship, Pittsburgher Kathleen Don-
nelly. Claiming to have the “smallest
of the small presses,” Donnelly and
Phyliss Mecking, who lives in Bos-
ton, have “literally one title,” which
Mecking wrote: Confessions of a
Late Bloomer, or, Wear tnough
Eye Make-up and No One Will
Notice Your Hips. The book grew
out of a series of columns originally
written for the Executive Women’s
Council of Greater Pittsburgh.

Donnelly and Mecking called the
press Quinn-Gallagher after their
mothers’ maiden names. “We fig-
ured that way they’d at least have to
buy copies,” Donnelly explained.

“You don’t earn a living publish-
ing a book,” emphasized Donnelly,
whose primary source of income is
Donnelly Communications, a small
advertising agency. “It’s a very low-
gain profession. Right now all we

own is the shirt on our backs and the .

copyrights.”

Both Quinn-Gallagher and Slow
Loris will be at the book fair at the
Writers’ Conference, as will the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh Press.

According to director Fred Het-
zel, the University of Pittsburgh
Press publishes 25-32 new books a
year and perhaps 6-8 reprints of
older books, depending on demand.

_“Our primary mission,” Hetzel
explained, “is to publish scholarly

ing the day...that’s

books of high quality.that it is not
economically feasible for commer-
cial publishing houses to handle.
Beyond that, as a service to Penn-
sylvania, we also publish high quality
semi-popular books.

“Since our'first book back in 1936
about architecture of early western
Pennsylvania, books dealing with
Pennsylvania and particularly west-
ern Pennsylvania have always been
important.” A -

Such books include Thomas
Bell’s Out Of This Furnace, a novel
about three generations of a Slovak
mining family living in Braddock,

burgher Robert C. Alberts who,

incidentally, has been commis-
sioned by the University to write its
200th (1787-1987) anniversary his-
tory, according to Hetzel. Another
favorite is a children's story about
Joe Magarac, “the Paul Bunyan of
the steel industry.” ,

Until recently, Out Of This Fur-
nance was “just about the only fic-
tion” they published, according to
Hetzel. Then in 1980, the University
of Pittsburgh Press received a grant
from the Howard Heinz Endow-
ment of Pittsburgh, enabling the
Press to create the Drue Heinz
Literature Prize.

The $5,000 prize, intended to rec-
ognize and encourage the writing of
short fiction, found its first winner. in
David Bosworth, a janitor in Cam-
bridge, Mass. who wrote in his spare
time. Bosworth’s The Death of Des-
cartes, was chosen from more than
300 manuscripts, by judges Philip
O’Connor, Eve Shelnutt, Paul West
and Robert Penn Warren.

The title piece is a novella, set on
the northern coast of Maine, whose
main character is a detective called
out of retirement to investigate a
imurder there. The Death of Des-
cartes has been favorably reviewed
by the New York Times and News-

week, and its ﬁrst edition sold out
within a month and a half.

Of the 25 or so new books pub-
lished by the University of Pitts-
burgh Press each year, about six are
in the Pitt Poetry Series, which
began in 1968 and is headed by Ed
Ochester. - , -

“We’re slowly increasing our
sales and distribution around the
country,” Ochester said. “We’re
doing more books by established
and new writers, and we’re getting
an increasing number of reviews.”

One of the first books published

in the Poetry Series, Satan Says by
Sharon Olds, won an annual prize
from the San Francisco Poetry Cen-
ter as the best first book of the year,
while The Axion Esti (published in
translation) by Greek poet Odys-
seus Elytis, was cited by the Nobel
Prize Committee for Literature. _
Last year the Pitt Poetry Series
initiated“ the $1,000 Agnes Starrett

Prize, named after the first director

of the University of Pittsburgh
Press. “lt’s one of the most attrac-
tive prizes for a first-time writer,”
Ochester said.

' The Poetry Series has published
more minority poets in recent years,
including Lorna Dee Cervantes, fa
Chicana. In her Emplumada, there
are “a number of poems,” Ochester
remarked, “that are relatively easily
accessible to people who don’t spe-
cialize in poetry. People will say, ‘I
can really read these...and like
these! l can really understand
these.’ This kind of lucidity isn’t the
ﬁrst thing we look for, but it has

been a thrill to find. In that respect, ,

the Pitt Poetry ‘Series is different
from any other publisher in the
U.S.”

The Carnegie-Mellon University
Press, which will be at the book fair,
also publishes a Poetry Series and
the Three Rivers Poetry Journal,
both headed by ‘Jerry Costanzo.

Involved in a cooperative associa-
tion with the Universitv of Pitts-

burgh Press from 1966 to 1976, the

International Poetry Forum is
directed by Duquesne -University
professor Samuel Hazo. ln 1976, the
Forum began publishing transla-
tions of the work of contemporary
foreign poets in a deluxe, limited ser-
ies called Byblos Editions. The
Forum’s recently released sixth
translation, A Bird of Paper, was
written by Nobel recipient Vicente

was designed by Pittsburgher Tho- _

Publishing  

By REGINA KVITKOVICHJ

Are women discriminated against
in the publishing world? The answer
depends on the woman’s goals for
her work,‘ according to several
members of the “Women in Publish-
ing” panel at this year’s writers’
conference. .

As part of the conference, the
panel will meet and discuss discrimi-
nation and other issues on Sunday,
March 21 from 1-2:20 p.m. in the
Frick Fine Arts Building. ‘

Moderated by Mary Briscoe,
chairman of Pitt’s English depart-
ment, the panel will consist of Jeff
Schwartz of Alice James Press, a
women’s publishing cooperative;
Jane Rosenman, an editor at E.P.
Dutton; literary agent Ellen Levine;
and Janet Sternberg, editor of The
Writer on Her Work as well as direc-
tor/ writer of the film Virginia Woolf:
The Moment Whole, which will be
shown at the conference. ,

Briscoe said that the panel will

‘ discuss how women see themselves

as writers, if there are any special
consequences for women in pub-
lishing and how much progress has
been made in accepting women in
the publishing world.

In addition to taking questions
from the floor, Briscoe said the
panelists are going to make short
presentations on their experiences
in publishing.

The panel members’ ‘different
reactions to the question of discrimi-
nation stems from their orientation
to the publishing world. Schwartz
and Sternberg are published wri-
ters; Levine and Roseman are in the
business of publishing writers. Wri-
ters and publishers have different
goals, and women face different
forms of discrimination. V

“Success in commercial publish-
ing depends on quality and commer-
cial potential (of the work),”
Rosenman said. “These are sexless

   
  
   

questions. In ‘terms of fiction, a V

woman can be more commercially
viable than a man. It depends on the
kind of fiction, but a woman can be
sought after.” -

Rosenman handles mostly fiction»
including John Irving, ,

writers,
author of Hotel New Hampshire
and The World According to Garp
and mystery writer Amanda Cross.

When asked about opportunities
for women, Rosenman said that the
editorial side of publishing has tradi-
tionally been a good ﬁeld for women,
even though in the past, women
were held to the lower-level jobs. ’

“But that’s really changing,” she
said. “(Women) can come and go
anywhere. The ﬁeld is open.”

Sternberg agrees that both the
editorial and business aspects of
publishing are opening up to
women.

“My editor at Norton - (Carol
Hauck Smith),. . . during the time
that my book was published,
became vice president (of W.W.
Norton). That was a major step for-
ward,” she said. “But as it is in prac-
tically every other industry"" you
could” name, the top level is still
men.

Intellectual discrimination against
women writers disturbs Sternberg
more. Although she said The Writer
on Her Work, a collection of 16
essays by modern female American
writers such as Joan Didion, Erica
Jong and Anne Tyler, was well-
received, Sternberg believes that
women writers face “enormous
disadvantages.”

Unlike the 19th-century writer
Charlotte Bronte, women no longer
face being prohibited from publish-
ing, but instead are confronted with
more subtle forms of disc-rimination,
Sternberg said.

“It's the climate of reviewing.
There is a resistance to reviewing. . .
overtly feminist works,” Sternberg
said. “lt’s a question of ghettoizing.”

Sternberg said that when
women’s books are reviewed,
reviewers sometimes tend to judge
the entire feminist movement.

, Reviewers also often take the
woman’s work out of the context in
which it was written, Sternberg said.
She cited as an example a recent
review of a biography on the 20th-
century female poet H.D. in the
New York Times Book Review.

“The reviewer did the most pecul-
iar thing. So much of that review
was on H.D. and her difficult rela-
tionships with the men in her life.

“That’s certainly‘ a piece of her
biography,” Sternberg said, but

pointed out that the reviewer never

talked about H.D.’s body of work as
a whole. ,

‘‘It was one of those reviews that
said, ‘Gee, didn’t she have an

- unhappy love life,’ ” Sternberg said.

Like Sternberg’s example of
Bronte, Schwartz has his own
example of the neglected female
19th-century writer-—.—Alice James.
The sister of author Henry James
and psychologist WilliamJames, the
value of Alice’s writing was not dis-
covered until her diaries were read
after her death.

According to Schwartz, the men
and women who started the Alice
James Press felt that her case typi-
fied the principal problem female
writers face-—beirig ignored.

“lt’s hard. for anyone to get
started, but in some cases, women
have a harder time getting attention
or reaction to their writing,” said
Schwartz. » ‘

“Alice James Press was started to
help anyone who published good
poetry, but especially women,” he
said. .
Schwartz said that while the press
specifically encourages submissions
bywomen, several men, including
himself, have been published by
Alice James Press. '

Schwartz joined the press in 1978

when it accepted for publication his
book of poetry, Contending With ‘

The Dark. He is now in the doctoral
program for creative writing and
rhetoric .at Carnegie-Mellon
University.

Schwart_z believes that women
are now able to publish more than in
the past because of the greater
number of small presses. ‘

“ln cooperatives like Alice James,
we publish quality work and take
more risks than do the large com-

A mercial houses,” he said.

“Since I’m ‘not a woman, I see
(Alice James Press) as more of an
alternative press,” Schwartz said.
He explained that an alternative
press is more likely to be receptive
to‘ books with low commercial
potential, such as poetry, and give
the writer more control.

Small    
Presses  

By FREDERICK BEERS

The small press is alive and well
according to participants in the
small presses panel discussion at

this year’s University of Pittsburgh

Writers’ Conference.

The panel will deal with problems
in running the small, independently
owned operations which publish
non-commercial material.

Tony Petrosky, editor and pub-
lisher of Slow Loris Press in Pitts-
burgh, said there have never been

more small presses in the country

than right now.
Statistics confirm Petrosky’s

claim. Since 1974 the number of ~
. small presses has increased three-

fold, according to the International
Directory of Small Presses and Lit-
tle Magazines. ln 1974 there were
onlyi1,330 small presses and little
magazines; today there are well
over 4,000.

Len Fulton, editor of -the direc-
tory, said, “There’s no question
about it—the small press industry is
enjoying a period of prosperity.”

For the uninitiated, the small

press can be defined as a publishing
operation that only produces about
one to ﬁve different books per year
and publishes only about 1,000 to
3,000 copies of each. i

. Paul Mathews, who .has com-
pleted the Radcliffe Publishing
Procedures Course, an intense
nine-week study of all phases of the
publishing industry, said the small
press is characterized by the type of
material it publishes——usually po-
etry or short fiction and generally
outside of the mainstream. Its liter-
ary nature and limited circulation,

appeal and advertising all contribute _

to the fact that it is usually a money-
losing operation, often dependent
on grants. It isalso usually run by a
staff of four or ﬁve people.

Mathews noted that established
authors often contribute work to a
small press to support. it. ,

Perhaps a good indicator of just
how well small presses are doing is
the environment in which they are
produced—the literary scene.

The literary scene spans‘ the
entire gamut of writers-—those pub-

. lished commercially and non-

commercially, editors of large and

small publishing houses, and college 1

English department faculties who
read and write all forms of literature.
It includes both experimental; and
mainstream writing. The literary
scene is a community that generates
ideas on the way the general public

_ reads and evaluates literature.

Petrosky said the number of small

.presses in the country right now

“says something about how alive the

literary scene is. You get to see the ”

number of people writing when
you’re at a small press. Many people

'write in response to the-(popularity-

of the) literary scene, but there’s
often no place to get published, and

- that’s what we’re all about. It's a

riters, Editors,Pub l i she r 3...

forum for people who don’t yet have‘

a foot in the door.”
And an important forum at that.

The small press is a significant V .

outlet for poetry and short fiction,

something the larger houses have -

been shying away from, Petrosky
said.

Usually a writer’s first published
piece appears in a little oriliterary
magazine, or through a small press.
A small press handles such things as
chapbooks, a 10-20 page book of
poetry or prose, or broadsides
which consist of poetry or prose
printed on a single sheet of fancy or
high-quality paper. These are usu-
ally of limited circulation and appeal.

Noted writers such as Ernest ‘T

Hemmingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald‘f

and Walt Whitman got their start in
small presses.

‘Slow Loris Press screens about
1,000-1,500 manuscripts in a 11/22
year period. From that number,
Petrosky said, often only two will be
published. '

. While the ‘ condition of small_
presses might be healthy, Petrosky
said the general public is not taking
full advantage of this prosperity. He
said one purpose of the writers’ con-
ference is to “make the public more

, aware of what we do and why.”

Petrosky, moderator of this_

year’s panel discussion, said there‘; .
will be a brief introduction on small ’

presses followed by discussion
among the panelists about presses,
including how to submit work and
what kind of writingsmall press edi-
tors look for.

 

  

The panelists will include Stan
Lindberg, editor of the Georgia
Review, one of the top literary mag-
azines in the country; Robert Pope,
editor of Akros, the literary maga-
zine at the University of Akron; and
Janet Sternberg, director/ writer of
the film, Virginia , Woolf: The
Moment Whale, and editor of The
Writer On‘ Her Work.

 Petrosky said the small pressalso
- se

rves to bring writers’ work to the
attention of larger presses. He
stressed that through circulation
and readings of small press material,
editors of the larger houses are
introduced to new writers.

He explained that it’s easier for a
writer to be published by a larger
press when he or she had already
-something published by a smaller
press—.-it increases his or her visibil-
ity and viability in commercial liter-
ary markets.-

In addition to its function as a
starting point for unestablished writ-
ers, the small press also serves as an
alternative or underground forum.

“(It's a) very political thing,”
Petrosky said, stating that the small

 press has traditionally been an alter-

native for writers who are not part of
the establishment.

Lindberg said small presses are . a

“vital to a healthy writer’s climate,”
but noted that there are some “omi-
nous signs” on the horizon.

He described the small press as
being in a “period of transition.”

“Public ' funding cuts will put a
burden on small presses, already
operating under enormous sacri-
fice. Some may go under,”’Lindberg
said. . g
The Georgia Review editor also
cautioned that the commercial
“trade houses are showing less will-
ingness to take risks,” stressing that
the onus of publishing the writers of

ﬁve future will lie with the small

’ ’ress.

“Ours is a role of discovering and
nourishing beginning writers, and
we must try and fulfill that role,”
Lindberg said. “There are a lot of
good writers out there that you’re
not going to find in the commercial
presses.” .

Lindberg noted that there is “truly
beautiful work” being published by
the small presses. He cited Paul
Zimmer’s work, The Ancient'Wars,
published by Slow Loris Press. He
.called it a “model” of the kind of
work that is being done by the small
press.

Another point Lindberg brought
p was his belief that there’s not

  I enough reading being done of small

press publications.

“There’s more writing being done
than reading,” he commented.
“People should cast an economic
vote (through purchasing) for
reading.”

Lindberg said he is particularly
pleased that there will be a display at
the conference where “people can
get an idea for their potential contri-
butions to smallpresses.”

Pope called the small press and
the literary magazine “the lifeblood

.__ of the American writer.”

.,a He emphasized the relationship

 “etween writers and publishers.



“I believe there is a lack of aware-
ness that this is an existing system
that (writers and publishers) must
take energy from and put energy
back into. Many lose this aware-
ness,” Pope said.

Survival for the small press, he.

said, lies incooperative and recipro-
cal agreements.

The conference will “serve to
make people more aware of the
need for such relationships,” Pope
said.

“The whole thing (writing and
publishing) is based on the love of
good literature. Without it, there’s
nothing,” he commented.

He said the thing that makes pub-
lishing worthwhile is finding a» good
manuscript. ‘ ‘

Sternberg, who is also a part of
the “Women In Publishing” panel,
agreed that small presses play a vital
role in the society. "They’re a main
source for continuous free speech,”
she said.

“When you’re just starting out, I
believe it’s important to see your

 

work in print—there’s the sense

that you’ve been validated by your_

peers,” she said.

This means a lot to a young writ-
er, Sternberg said, because it “spurs
the writer on. I think this is as impor-
tant as (its forum function),” she
said. ' - ,

Sternberg said she will speak at
the conference “only from the per-
spective of a writer.” —

Her book, The Writer On Her
Work, is a collection of essays by
women writers concerning their
work with writing and publishing.

Perhaps Paul Mathews best
summed up the sentiment of small
presses when he said, “The small

. press may not be the backbone of
the publishing industry-—but we
would be in a lot worse shape with-
out it.”

Sellingwhat
You   Write  

By JEANLASKUS

Students and writers interested in
marketing their prose and poetry
will look inside the publishing world
from at least three different angles at

“Selling What You Write,” a panel .

discussion featuring Rolling Stone
magazine editor Terry McDonell;
Jane Rosenman, editor at E.P. Dut-
ton lnc. publishers; and literary
agent Ellen Levine. The discussion
is scheduled .for 2 p.m., Saturday,
March 20, in the Frick Fine Arts
Building.

Terry McDonell began his career
in journalism when he travelled
through the Middle East in 1970 as a
news photographer. He later joined
the Associated Press in New York,
writing features and directing edu-
cational documentaries.

Returning to his native California,
he worked for City magazine in San
Francisco and then helped to create
Outside magazine, a monthly glossy

for backpackers started by Rolling ‘

Stone.
McDonell was founding editor of

Rocky Mountain magazine, which
he later left in order to concentrate
on writing full time. California
Bloodstock, a tale of life in the early
days of that state, is his first novel,
published in 1980 by Macmillan‘Co.

In the midst of a screenplay and
second novel, McDonell left his
Montana ranch in December 1980
to join Rolling Stone as managing
editor. ' _

“I came in to help with the new
format,” McDonell explained. “Roll-
ing Stone wasn’t doing very well
(economically). We needed a new
focus.”

In . its new... trimmed-down,
revamped magazine look, the music
section of.Rolling Stonelhas been
squeezed to the back of the book to
accommodate a more general inter-
est journal devoted to politics, film
and, through McDonell’s constant
urging, ficti__on.

“I’d like Rolling Stone to be a mag-
azine of the widest range of cultural
activity,” McDonell said.

Receiving some 50 letters a week
from writers trying to sell their ideas
to Rolling Stone, McDonell comes

The Pitt News, Monday, March 15, 1982

to the writers’ conference with lots
of ‘advice for student journalists.

“One of the most important
things for any writer to do, I think, is
to get a sense of the market he
wants to write for. I getlots of query

letters that do little moreithan tell I

me that the writer doesn’t read my
magazine. Those are usually written
by people who think Rolling Stone
editors are a bunch of hippies who
sit around in bare feet smoking
joints.

“It’s not uncommon for me to get
a letter addressed, ‘DearJBrother,’

or something. Well, this is a busi-

ness here, and we like people to
treat it as such.” ‘
As a businessman, journalist and

novelist, McDonell joins the other ’

panelists eager to discuss the pub-
lishing world from his perspective.
“And maybe I can find someone
whose work we can use in our maga-
zine,” he said. “I’m always looking.”

Jane Rosenman, before E.P. Dut-
ton, worked. at Holt, Rinehart &
Winston Co. in the subsidiary rights
department—-selling movie, paper-

back, magazine and other rights. A

She acquired this job as a newly
graduated English major from Willi-
ams College, Williamstown, Mass.

She was later hired by E.P. Dut-
ton as an assistant to the late Henry
Robbins, one of the first editors at

E.P. Duttonto have his own imprint
(Henry Robbins Books).

“I read for him for a year and a half

when I began buying books on my-

own,” Rosenman explained.

On the staff of,E.P. Dutton for five
and a half years now, Rosenman,
who deals primarily in fiction,
worked as John Irving’s editor on
his latest book, Hotel New Hamp-
shire. She also handles well-known
mystery writer Amanda Cross, as
well as a number of beginning nov-

elist, such as Marsha Parker whose.

first book, Ghosts, will appear this
spring. Both Cross and Parker are
represented by literary agent Ellen
Levine.

Rosenman especially looks for-

ward to talking with students at this‘

year’s writers’ conference. “People
in this business often forget how
much outsiders doand don’t know,”
‘she said. “I’d like to explain just how
it is that an editor works.

“An editor functions very auto-

‘ nomously. I'm responsible for bring-

ing in about six books each year. It’s

- rare for me to accept an unsolicited

manuscript. About 90 percent of the
books I read are brought to my
attention by agents.

“But I can find a book anywhere
from a dinner party to a chat with a
friend’; My job is to keep my eyes
open.

Ellen Levine began her career in
publishing with New American
Library publishers and later joined
Harper and Row. ‘She became an
apprentice agent at Paul R. Rey-
nolds Agency where she handled
magazine sales. Levine developed a
client list at Curtis ’Brown-Agency

Some of her clients ' include
Collette Dowling, author of Cinder-
ella Complex, Garrison Keillor who
wrote Happy to be Here and Mari-
lynne Robinson, author of
Housekeeping. I

Joining the “Selling What You
Write” panel, Levine, who is a
member of the Society of Author's
Representatives and the Indepen-
dent Literary Agents Association,
will discuss the importance of liter-
ary agents and just how to go about
getting one. ’

Moderating the panel will be fic- .

tion and non-fiction writer, Bruce
Dobler, an assistant professor in

«Pitt’s English department. I

“Any l'i_Qp_e_ful freelance writer

should find the ‘Selling What You .

Write’ panel a wonderful opportun-
ity to hear editors and agents talk
about writing,” Dobler said. “Begin-
ning novelists, short story writers

and magazine journalists often.

come to ‘readings’ to hear what

other writers have to say about their »

craft or the world of publishing.
That’s fine, of course, and I enjoy it
myself. But—-ultimately——-it isn’t
other writers who publish your
work, but editors and, often, agents.
I like to know what they think about,
too.” I .

The first question most often
asked of students. majoring in Eng-
lish writing——previously considered
a passport to starvation or worse—
is: “Will you support yourself?”

But ever since its creation in the
1930s, Pitt’s writing program, the
oldest and largest in the country in
number of undergraduates enrolled,
has directed hundreds of students
towards literary and journalistic
success.

The graduates of the fiction and
poetry branch of the program
include: Jack Gilbert, winner of the
Yale Younger Poets Prize; Gerald
Stern, winner of the LaMont Prize
for poetry; Peter Beagle, a screen-

writer and novelist; and Leonard -
’ Baker, winner of the Pulitzer Prize

for his book Days of Sorrow and
Pain: Leo Baeck and Berlin Jews.

. In the past six years, recent
undergraduates have had articles
published in Sports Illustrated,
Esquire, Cosmopolitan, and the
Saturday Evening Post. Some grad-

_uates of the non-fiction writing

sequence include: Associated Press
Washington correspondent Gene
Grabowski, United Press Interna-
tional London correspondent Scott
MacLeod, novelist Dennis
Palumbo, and Pittsburgh Press staff
writer Matthew Kennedy.

The writing program concen-
trates on three areas: poetry, fiction
and non-fiction, which is split into
newspaper and magazine writing.
No matter in which area a student
chooses to major, the program is
demanding, requiring many pages of

Non-fiction coordinator Lee Gut-
kind said the non-fiction sequence
has experienced the fastest growth
of all the areas. Courses specializing
in municipal reporting, sports writ-
ing and The Pitt News have been
created within the past year, while a
new faculty member, James Roth of
the Hartford Courant, will begin
teaching in September.

Orchester said there are no major
changes planned for the fiction or
poetry areas, but he added there will
be some “fine tuning” within the
overall program. One recent change
has been that students must receive
a C grade or higher in a course
before continuing in the sequence.

In addition to the undergraduate
program, Pitt also offers a graduate

twritins program in poetry, fiction

and non-fiction. The program was

Gutkind’s unique

By SETH iuaovis

Lee Gutkind's office, tucked
away in the far-most corner of Pitt’s
English department, hasn’t changed
much since he arrived at Pitt. In fact,
the only decorations he has
indulged in are some posters on the
walls, none of which have much sig-
nificance except for the one
announcing Pitt’s wiiters’ confer-
ence, of which he is chairmanand
director. No, the sparsely furnished
office with a view of the student
union hasn’t changed much over the
years.

But the man who occupies that
office has.

Changing his lifestyle, character,
habits and speech are .all part of
Gutkind’s unique approach to writ-
ing,‘an approach he has developed
since he started his professional
writing career in the mid—1960’s. lt’s
a lifestyle and a writing style in one,
adapted from the so-called new jour-
nalism techniques, where the
author attempts to create a‘ first-
hand account of his characters’ life-
styles by experiencing life with

. them. - ~ I ~

“The only way to write withan
inner eye and an inner knowledge is
to become a part of the subject
about which you are writing,” Gut-
kind says.

Students and colleagues who
have known Gutkind since he began
teaching at Pitt in 1970, will recall the
days when he taught his classes in a
set of motorcycle leathers and
roamed the halls in big black cleated
boots while writing Bike Fever, an
account. of his wanderings cross-
country on a motorcycle.

A few years later, students were
subject to a barrage of baseball trivia
and folklore when Gutkind was writ-
ing The Best Seat in Baseball, But
You Have to Stand, his book about
life with a crew of National League
baseball umpires during the 1974
season.

Gutkind has also worked in a
rodeo in Wyoming and as a circus
clown as part of his research for
other stories. ,

Recently, Gutkind has put the
motorcycle leathers and baseballs in
storage, in favor of rattlesnake hunt-
ing and fur trapping while writing
and producing his first film, A Place
Just Right. The film, a documentary

1 Approach to Writing

about the backwoods people of
Western Pennsylvania, was given a
Golden Eagle award by CINE, the
Council on International Nontheat-
rical Events and a Golden Quill by
the Pittsburgh Press Club.

Gutkind is currently writing a
book about his experiences in the
backwoods.

God’s Helicopter, Gutkind’s first
novel, will be published later this
year by Slow Loris Press, after 12
years of writing. .

“The novel is about growing up in
Pittsburgh,” Gutkind says. “And, in
any way, I grew _up as a writer as I
wrote the book. Every time I learned
more about writing, I wrote the
book again. I wrote it one more time
in 1979, after being awarded a
National Endowment of the Arts
creative writing fellowship, based on
part of the manuscript. Not long
after, Slow Loris asked to publish it.

Despite two books and the
upcoming novel, articles for Sports
Illustrated, The New York Times,
The Associated Press, and a film,
Gutkind says he is nowhere near the
peak of his professional career. In
fact, he’s the first to admit that he’s a
long way off from his peak, wher-

ever and whenever that is.

“I started late in my writing
career. I have'a lot more to do and
many more years to develop,” he
says.

The roots of Gutkind’s career can

be found in, of all places, the Coast .

Guard, where he enlisted in the
early '60s after graduating from
Pittsburgh’s Taylor Allderdice High
School. Gutkind recalls the only
thing to do in the service, besides
‘studying morse code and mopping
ﬂoors, was to read in the base
library. There was one other thing
the Coast Guard was good for.
While in the service, Gutkind

V managed to go from 220 to 150

pounds, a weight.he maintains by
jogging each day. ‘

Gutkind returned to his native
Pittsburgh after the stint in the ser-
vice, and later managed to get his
bachelor’s degree from Pitt at night
while working at the same time for a
public relations firm. He quit public
relations soon after graduation" and
came to Pitt to teach and write.

He has written every day since
that time, although the hours he

spends per day have decreased over _

ford, Michigan and Yale.

ery Culver, a former writing pro- ’

gram director.

over after Hunt retired. “It was prac-

tically a one-man job at the tii‘ne,” ‘

more confident * and steady in his
writing abilities.

“I worked damn hard and I con-

he says.

Gutkind is the coordinator 0'1
Pitt’s non-fiction writing program,
one of the architects of the graduate '
program in writing and founder and
director of the Pitt writers’ confer-
ence. Gutkind says he wants to
teach young journalists how to be
writers rather than just reporters.

“We don’t want to produce the
same kind of student turned out by
the journalism schools. The bottom
line is to teach students how to
write.” he says.

With writers’ conferences and
books and films and whatever else
he can possibly accomplish, will
Gutkind ever decide to scrap teach-

ing in favor of a full-time writirj‘

career? Don’t count on it. ~

“I think I’d probably like to be able
to write more and teach less, but I’ll
never completely give up my teach-
ing. My life is very well-balanced as it

is,” he says.

The ok Fair:

Small Presses Offer TheirFinest

And No One Will Notice YourHips, f

By JILL SAVITZ

lsitors to the Sixth Annual Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh Writers’ Con-
ference will have the opportunity to
purchase small press publications
that can’t be found elsewhere in the
city and can meet people involved
with both local and national small
presses at the conference book fair.

The fair—a series of exhibits of‘

publications by small presse&—will
be open during the conference from
10 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Saturday and
Sunday, March 20-21, 1982.
The fair will be located in the dais-
ter of the Frick Fine Arts Building.
Small presses are publishing
, operations that produce only limited
editions of a few books or maga-
zines a year. They usually publish
ﬁrnative works that are outside
‘Li e mainstream of current fiction
and poetry trends.

Because of their limited commer-
cial appeal, ‘works published by
small presses are often hard to
locate in bookstores. The book fair,
however, will offer access to these

ing to Kinnell, is that most people
exhaust themselves to earn a living.
I “When they come home, they
want something to massage their
brains,” he said. “They’re not in a
frame of mind to put out real effort
and attention.”
His own poetry has become more
personal over the years. -
“It’s based more on the circum-

stances of my life now than when l

 ounger,” he said. “My poems
 more fictionalized then than

   
 

" re now.”

“But in a 1971 article in Field maga-
zine titled “Poetry, Personality and
Death,” Kinnell wrote that contem-
porary poetry was egotistical and
centered too much on the writer. He
does not, however, see a contradic-

~ tion in these two beliefs.

“For, while my poems are based
on the facts of my life, I think of them
as having a certain universality to
them,” he explained. “There is a
stage, a jump, some kind of bridge
that has to be made between what is
merely personal——a kind of journal
entry——and a work of art. And
somehow, what is merely personal

“The purpose of the fair is to allow
small presses to familiarize people

with their work,” said Ed Ochester,‘
director of Pitt’s Writing Program. .

Ochester will represent the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh Press in the
fair. Some recently published books
in the press’ poetry series include
Sharon Olds’ Satan Says and
works by Dick Shelton.

Publications included..at this
year’s fair will include national and
local literary magazines featuring
both fiction and poetry work.

The nationally reknowned quar-
terly publication, The Georgia

will have a display at the fair. Among
the magazine’s contributors are
Pulitzer Prize winners Robert Penn

known writers such as Joyce” Carol

them.”

With all this, Kinnell doesn’t think
he really fits in with the contempor-
ary poetry of today. Still, he feels a
kinship with some poets, “mostly of
my generation or younger, and
while I don’t think we’re doing the
same things in our poetry, I see it as
a cousin relationship, not as a
brother or sister relationship. I think

According to the magazine’s
advising editor, Robert Pope, Akros
began as a journal that featured only
local writers. It has now expanded
to include writers on a national level,
Pope said.

“Akros publishes unknowns, but
we are also interested in more estab-
lished writers, although every
manuscript gets at least three good
readings,” he said.

Terry McDonell:

Rolling With The Changes

By WALTER R. WATSON -

Working as a photojournalist,
making documentary films, travel-
ing to Lebanon and Jordan, attend-
ing the University of California at
Berkeley and later Irvine for art,
writing a novel and then magazine
articles for Francis Ford Coppola
may not necessarily make you fit to
be managing editor of Rolling Stone
magazine, but in Terry McDonell’s
case, it didn’t hurt.

McDonell will attend Pitt's Writ-
ers’ Conference this year to speak
on a panel concerning how free-
lance writers can sell what they
write, and will make himself availa-
ble to students andnew writers, an-
swering their questions regarding
the best way to present their work
to. publications, and about how Rol-
ling Stone operates.

The 37-year-old McDonell has .

been on travels that haveled him as

- far away as the Middle East during

the 3-month period of the early
1970s known as “Black Sep-
tember,” where he worked as a free-
lance cameraman. Upon his return
from abroad, he worked _for the
Associated Press’ New York

- bureau, where in a relatively short

period of time (less than three

years), he won awards from the
New York International Television
and Film Society for some of his
documentaries. After his ‘work

there, his exploits included both
work with the short-lived southern
California newspaper L. A., pur-
ported to - be the West Coast's
answer to the Village Voice, and a
few yearslater he wrote for City
magazine, which was owned at that
time by highly acclaimed ﬁlmmaker
Francis Ford Coppola.

“I though it would be interesting
working for a man like Coppola,” he
said. “I was wrong,” he added, say-
ing that the operation of City had
little, if any, differences with other
magazines McDonell had worked
for.

McDonell’s first novel, California
Bloodstock, written in 1976, is a
tum-of-the-century look at “the-
truth about the invention of
California.”

Tom Robbins, author of Even
Cowgirls Get The Blues, wrote:
“California Bloodstock is an oyster
of a book, salty and delicious; pearl-
handled,‘ silver-barreled derringer of
a book, small, elegant and snappy...
I was sickened, delighted, and very

impressed.”

McDonell,’ originally from Virgi-
nia, said that his struggle to get the
novel published was among the

worst experiences of his writing

career.

' “Before the book was sold, I was
told that no one was buying west-
erns anymore, and then later that
westerns were back in—all the
while, my novel wasn’t a western at
all. When I came to Rolling Stone,
McMillan bought it——that was

almost four years after I had written
it,” McDonell said.

Since joining Rolling Stone,-

McDonell has introduced the publi-
cation of short fiction to the pages of
the magazine, much to the dislike of
publisher Jann Wenner.

“Jann’s against the idea of having
fiction in Rolling Stone; I’m strongly
for it. I publish just quality fiction;
things outside the mainstream of fic-
tion,” he said.

McDonell has published the fic-
tion of Jane Anne Phillips and John
Irving among others. Although he
does not publish fiction at, regular
intervals, it appears on the pages
whenever he deems it necessary.

Rolling Stone is completely writ-
ten by free-lance writers, McDonell

-admits, despite the falsely held belief

that the publication is staff-written.
He added that often the strength of
a subject dictates what articles are
used by the . magazine, since not
every writer is “able to bring a cer-
tain amount of style to the subject.
Sometimes, we have to print writing
that "reads dull,” he said.

“We_’d prefer to do otherwise, and
that’s why we are open to new writ-
ers, good ones, especially.”

McDonell’s influences in writing‘
include Tom Wolfe, Rolling Stone's
own Hunter S. Thompson, who
heads the magazine’s national
affairs desk, Mark Twain, Jim Harri-
son, Thomas McGuane and others.
“I’m greatly inﬂuenced by the people
I've had an opportunity to work

with’——Gay Talese is a brilliant wri-
ter, McDonell said.

_ Besides McDonell’s own ladder of
success (which can be likened to
Jacob’s), he well remembers the
rare story of one of Rolling Stone’s
three staff «writers, Chris Connelly.

“Chris started out as a switch-
board operator. Very few people
would take the route that he chose,”
McDonell said. “Chris was a gradu-
ate in American studies at Yale. He
kept trying to convince us that he
could write, and we finally paid
attention, and put him towork on
the ‘Random Notes’ section of the
magazine, which he does now.

“Few people would really want to
do that, but he’s coming right along;
he rarely writes feature-length mate-
rial. He covers music, as do staff
writers Steve Pond and Kurt Loder.
The:/re ourionly staff writing per-
sonnel. The rest of the staff—of 53

people——are fact-checkers,
designers, people who help us run
smoother than if we operated with-
out them. We call in outside people,
like Ben Fong-Torres, to do things
for us. We get outside help with pho-
tography and design, but we need a

basic staff of people on hand for ‘
_ those jobs too,” McDonell said.

Whenever time permits, McDo-
nell gets away fromit all on his ranch
in Montana. He is currently nego-
tiating the final sale of a screenplay
he \has written, and says that the
work on his second novel has been
held up indefinitely by his work with
Rolling Stone.

McDonell said that as an editor,
he is “not amused by cuteness. I like

‘ queries that are direct and to the ‘

point-'—I want to get this done-I
don’t like to fool around.

“It’s like one of these telephone
anwering machines,” said McDo-
nell, “where you sometimes have to
listen through a monologue of jokes,
and then a person’s favorite recw
before you can hear the beep to Q\
your message. I find that approach
annoying, whether it be on a phone
or in a letter,” he said.

“The first query should show the
writer’s skill,” said McDonell, mak-
ing the analogy of query letters to
ﬂy-fishing: the writer presents the
ﬂy, or story idea,’ to a fish, or editor.
The more attractive the ﬂy, the
more likely the fish is to bite or get
hooked on a story. ,

McDonell noted that his first
‘experience writing professionally
was back in college, where he wrote
term papers for his fellow students.
He said that although Ivy League
schools like Yale have established a

strong reputation of turning out -
good writers, smaller schools hj }

been able to do their part as we
“No one place seems to be a cen-

. ter. There’s always been Columbia

and Missouri, but places like Stan-
ford and'( Pitt) are putting out a good
number (of writers),” McDonell
said. He said that he personally does
not hold reservations as to where a
writer learns his craft, adding,
“Good writers are from all over:
there’s no telling where they’re com-
ing from.”

“I was one of those awful child
poets who win prizes and scholar-
ships,” recalls writer/filmmaker
Janet Sternberg. “One of the schol-
arships in fact funded my attend-
ance to a women’s college, which I
‘went to for about a year and a half.

_‘‘I then decided that I didn’t want
to write. I had a scholarship to be a
writer—the money was specifically
earmarked for that——and (instead) I
made several films for a number of
years. I returned to writing, basi-
cally, when I was 31 or so, because I

Cwwanted to reclaim something that I

had lost.” -

Sternberg co-edited an anthology
of essays by women writers entitled
The Writer On Her Work. She
works as program officer for the
New York Council for the Humani-
ties and creative director of» the
Manhattan Theatre Club. Stern-
berg will sit on the “Women in Pub-
lishing” and “Small Press” panels at
Pitt’s Writers’ Conference this Sat-
urday and Sunday.

Sternbercz has to her credit over
70 documentaries, several of which
deal with writers, many of which.
were sold to public television. Stern-
berg’s film, Virginia Woolf: The
Moment Whole will be screened

The Pitt News. Monday, March 15, 1982

Sunday at the conference. She also
appears in a recent anthology of
New York women writers entitled
Ordinary Women.

As program “officer for the New
York Council for the Humanities,
Sternberg works with people who

‘ come to ‘the council “with ideas,

proposals of things they want to
have funded, to evaluate the pro-
grams, to work with them in devel-
oping those proposals into
successful projects.”

‘‘It’s not just film,” said Stemberg,

“it’s across the board. Public pro-
grams in the humanities include‘.
conferences, exhibits——any' kind of
forum that is a public event that
brings scholars and a general
audience together. The other part of
what I do at the council is develop
mental work,.ideas that we have
here, .and then go toward their
realization.”

The Manhattan Theatre Club is
an organization that sponsors'work-
shops, talks and a performance ser-
ies concerned with and about

writers. There, Sternberg works_

extensively on producing, and in
some cases, writing, programs for
MTC’s “Writers In Performance”
series.

There were two recent programs
held by the Manhattan Theatre"
Club that Sternberg found. “very

night event, “An Evening With Ray-
mond Chandler,” in which actor
John Houseman and Darren
McGavin with writer John McShane
gave theatrical readings of the
author’s work. Sternberg co—wrote
the program with McShane. The
second event was a reading two
weeks ago featuring writers David

‘.5, 1
and Ring ardner, r.

“I wish I could give you a very
clear, cogent guideline criterion,”
said Sternberg concerning how pro-
grams are chosen for the series.
“But. one doesn’t exist. It really
comes out of a combination of
things. It has been, frankly, guided
by my own taste; and‘I stand behind
my taste,” said Sternberg.

“I mean, I love to read something
and think that it’s wonderful, and
think, ‘Oh, more people should hear
this person.’ At the same time, I’ve
made a strong effort, as other peo-
ple who have worked with me have
done, to make awfully sure that our
taste is eclectic. I really believe in a

15 ‘

' series, for example, as ours did two

years ago, mat has an evening of
Susan Sontag reading her fiction,
William Gatz reading his fiction and
introduced by Donald Barthelme——
a very big named (evening), with a
certain kind of clear_imprimaturive
quality,” Sternberg said.

She said that with the next sched-
uled program, by contrast, MTC
celebrated -the anthology, “Ordi-
nary Women,” which Sternberg
describes as a book “that comes out

The Image

‘ special.” The first was an opening

of the voices of women in New York
City of every different background. I
was in that book, and very proud to
be in that book, and it was a kind of
big benefit reading to make the book
90.”

Sternberg believes that enough is
going on in literature now that the
two literary events sponsored by the
organization “should not represent

two different attitudes toward
literature——they should exist cheek
by jowl, because both are about
wonderful work. It’s simply that I
don’t think enough people admit the
fact that wonderful work is being

, done by a lot of_people at different

levels of prominence. So, that kind
of sense of reaching out, first reach-
ing from the basis of a strong sense
of taste, second of all, understand-
ing that there is this larger world to
reach for,” she said. . -

Carol Hauck Smith, of W.W.
Norton, who may attend the confer-
ence as well, said of Stemberg,
“Janet is a woman with a high stand-
ard of excellence.” ’

Smith, who worked as an editor
with Sternberg on The Writer On
Her Work, added, “Working on the
book with her was a gratifying expe-
rience. I found her extremely plea-
sant to work with. She is a woman of
intelligence and sensitivity. She was
not only interested in the editorial
content but the design'(of The Wri-
ter On Her Work). She was able to
work with so many different people.
She is multi-talented. In editing
these articles, she was able to bring
together people of very different
temperaments,” Smith said.

“She was able to bring them all
together between the covers of one
book.” _

In comparing the advantages and
differences between her work with
film and with writing, Sternberg
noted that she was, “lucky,” in that i
all the films for which sheproposed
-grants were films she wanted to
make. She said that the major differ-
ence is that, “basically, with film,
you’re working with a gang of
people.”

“I stopped working with film
because I felt that writing ‘and film-
making were two profoundly
absorbing activities. When I
returned to writing, I found I had a
lot of catching up to do, so much
reading of modern poetry, so much
educating myself—that I thought

the two couldn’t co-exist,” Stern-
berg said. .

“It surprised me a lot when people
later on saidto me, ‘My goodness,

your writing is so cinematic.’ I had i

no sense of that, but all those yearsl
was making films, reviewing, and
programming them, they obviously
just got right into the bloodstream,
and back out into the poetry and the
other writing as well,” she said. ‘

“There would be times-—when I
was working on my own writing and
doing other things to make a living—
that I would miss the camaraderie.
But I really had to create a broader
base: workshops, a circle of friends,
a connection to the outside world
that every writer makes. Now, I
want to combine the two,” Stern-
berg said.

Sternberg named her inﬂuences
in both film and writing. “I adore
Jean Renoir; I love Rilke,” she said.
“Carl Brier is one of my favorite film-
makers of all time——his Joan of Arc,
might have been the thing that most
knocked me out. In poetry, when I
really want to touch bases with
something that feels pretty essential
to me, I go to Rilke, I go to D.H.
I.-awrence’s poems, l’ll read some
Dickinson. Louise Bogan is another
person I think about as an inﬂu-
ence,” Sternberg said.

“There are lots and lots of people I
like, but the ones I’ve mentioned are

-the ones that feel fundamental,”

Sternberg ‘said.

The 39-year-old writer-filmmaker- ’

administrator spoke about what she
believed participants should take
from the 1982 conference. '

‘‘I really do believe in the root of
the word, ‘inspiration,’ in the sense

of breath coming back into you. It’s '

a hackeyed work, ‘but when you
think of it in that way, it’s a wonder-
ful word. The second thing that I
think the conference will do, is to
direct one back to one’sown work,
to go on writing,” she saidu
“Third, is to consider it (the con-
ference) as a part of a community of
people engaged in a very specific
kind of enterprise,” Sternberg said.
“That community is loosely clung,
and in it, you have to find the people
who are of like spirit, like mind. But
once you find that, it’s the sense that
you‘ belong to a certain world.
Again,” Sternberg said, “it’s a world,
that, when it nourishes you, it gives

- you ‘heart,’ to return back to yor
, own work and do it well.” ‘

Studet Media:   Professional

By PAUL UNDERWOOD

You can’t miss them. They lie

J around on shelves, tables, stands
kland chairs. They’re in the Towers,

 the Student Union, the Cathedral of
Learning, David Lawrence Hall,
Benedum Hall and the Pitt Field
House.

They are members of Pitt’s stu-
dentmedia: The Pitt News, WPGH
radio, Backspace, and the Panther
Prints yearbook. They are responsi-
ble for informing, entertaining, pro-
voking, reforming, criticizing, prais-
ing, expressing, interpreting and
discovering things for Pitt’s stu-
dents, staff and faculty.

Quite a tall order, especially in a
university that has no journalism or
broadcasting department. This

. leaves them open to misunderstand-

fing, criticism and sometimes

hostility.

The university officially recog-
nizes the publications and radio sta-
tion under the stipulation that they
“are devoted to increasing student
awareness and to providing inter-

‘ested*students withtraining in spe-.

1

cific areas of communications.’
However, there’s a lot more to Pitt’s
student media. _

“The student media is more than
an extracurricular activity. We’re
actually using an extracurricular
activity to train and prepare stu-
dents for professional careers. I
believe the university itself has made
that commitment, not only through
its official recognition of the media
groups but through funding means
as well as professional advice and
counsel,” said Larry Lunsford,
assistant director of student activi-
ties and Pitt’s media advisor.

“(By) the latter I mean a profes-
sional advisor, classes for credit,
creation and funding of a total media
ﬂoor in the renovated Student
Union, and professional assistance
and funding through the Student
Publications and Media Board he
said.

The media board, the group
responsible for the revival of the
Writers’ Conference and whose
chairman, Lee Gutkind, is also
director of the Writers’ Conference,
is the otfi;ziaHy.dezle9ated.bodv at the

university’s Board of Trustees that

recognizes and oversees the cam-
pus media.

The board, comprised of five pro-
fessionals in communication from
within and without the university
and four students, is responsible for
recognizing official" campus media
groups, approval and funding of
budgets for those groups, selection
of chief officers of those media and
hearing complaints lodged against a
student medium.

While it may be true that students
interested in a serious career in
communications would have ap-
plied to schools with accredited
communications departments, the
journalists at Pitt are serious about
their work.

“We have to take The Pitt News
seriously because we have such an
impact on the campus community,”

said Pitt News editor Mary Kane.

“The Pitt News isn’t a controlled
environment like a classroom where
you conduct staged interviews and
get a grade for your performance.
We get paid for our work, we take

pride in it:.andnw,e,always, try to act 

T ’ . . .
professional in everything we do.”

The list of distinguished Pitt News
alumni proves that student journal-
ists at Pitt can have a future in com-
munications if they work hard
enough. Some of those alumni
include: Murray Chass of The New
York Times, Myron Cope of
WTAE, Matthew Kennedy of The
Pittsburgh Press, Susan Mannella of
the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Scott

MacLeod of United Press Interna-
tional, Leo Koeberlein, former exec-

utive editor of The Pittsburgh Press, .

Joyce Gemperlein of the Philadel-
phia lnquirer, Pohla Smith of UPI,
Evan Pattak of Warner Cable Co. of
Pittsburgh, Sharon Sexton of the
Baltimore News-American, and
Don Marbury of the Public Broad-
casting System.

“There’s one benefit of the stu-
dent media, but that's the most
important thing any college student
can get—experience,” said Regina
Kvitkovich, copyeditor and assis-
tant production manager of The Pitt
News and a student member of the
media board. ,5, « = =
