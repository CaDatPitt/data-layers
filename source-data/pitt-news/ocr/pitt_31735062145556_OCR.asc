Tal Henry And His North Carolinans
Play For Junior Prom Formal Dance

In William Penn Hotel Ballroom Tonight

 

Ellsworth Miller and‘
Helen Bruun To
Lead March

Tonight is Prom night.

The affair that annually causes the
biggest ﬂutter on every campus and
in many high schools throughout the
country, that causes loss of sleep for
committee members and for dated
and dateless students, and for which
half the football and basketball
squads are saved all season, ﬁnishes
off the University’s ﬁrst semfester so-
cial program in the ballroom of the
Vvilliam Penn hotel.

Each year the Prom dominates the
semester in which it comes, and, ac-
cording to an enthusiastic committee,
tonight's will carry on the tradition.
Tal Henry’s North Carolinans, fresh
from a long term engagement at the
New Yorker hotel in New York, will
play from; 9:30 to 2 o’clock for the
formal.

Announcement was made yesterday
afternoon that arrangements have been
made to broadcast Henry’s music
from the dance over station KDKA
from! 12:30 to 1 o’clock.

At 10 o’clock, H. Ellsworth Miller,
BA, dance chairman, and Miss Helen
Bruun, C35, will lead the grand march.
During the march the combination
fa.vor~programs will be distributed.

Tickets will remain on sale through-
out the day at a booth in Alumni hall,
in the oﬁlce of the dean of men, and
with members of the committee. The
tickets themselves are priced at $3.50
per couple, which is the most inex-,
pensive cost of that dance in Uni-‘
versiiy history, but special reserva-
tion tickets may be purchased for $1.
These tickets are redeemable at the
door upon payment of the remaining
$2.50. The volume of tickets sold up
to yesterday, according to Miller, as-
sures a capacity crowd at the affair.

The chaperons t‘onight are: Dean
and Mrs. A. H. Armbruster. Dr. and
Mrs. Omar C. Held, Dr. and Mrs. A.
S. Lawson, Dr. and Mrs. Gebhard
Stegeman, and Lt. and Mrs. D. C. Tre-

during the last three days of the ad-
vance registration period. The larg-
est daily total on record since the
plan was inaugurated was cleared last
Wednesday, when 462 completed reg-
istration details at Room 3, State hall,
The grand total for the announced
registration period, extending from
January 3-17, was 3,016, as compared
with 2,704 for a similar period last
year and with 1,862 for the ﬁrst year
of the new plan. It is interesting to
note that over 40 per cent of the stu-
dents reporting for advance registra-
tion completed all the steps of the
procedure including the payment of
their second semester tuition.

In a review of the registration
statistics at the close of the period
last Wednesday, it became apparent
that despite the large number report-
ed above there were many who had
not signed up for the second semester,
A conference revealed a number of
unavoidable delays, and the result
was a decision to extend the period
of registration another week or ten
days. Throughout this extended pe-
,riod advice may be obtained from ad-
visers and departments only during
their published office hours. However,
the registration headquarters, Room
3, State hall, will remain open from 9
o’clock until 4 o’clock, but will close
on Saturday at 1 o’clock.

Students now in the process of en-
rolling and those who have not as yet

As University Announces App
Panther Coach Andi Captain V

.-feating them each time,

» at a banquet given for the Panther

football team at the Pittsburgh Ath-
letic association by Chancellor John
G. Bowman,

Announcement was made last night
that Charles :Hartwig,a junior in the
school of education, had been ap-
pointed captain of the 1934-35 foot-
ball team. The appointment was made
by Coach John B. Sutherland.

, At the same time Mr. Harrison an-
nounced that the United States Mil-
itary Academy football team would
oppose the Panther football team in
the Pitt Stadium on November 9, 1935.

The announcement that Dr. Suther-
land had signed a contract puts at
rest the rumors. which repeatedly
bobbed up, having him go to Yale,
Southern California and about every
other school in the United States‘.
Since coming here as head coach in

;1924 Dr. Sutherland has made an en-
lviable record. Teams he has coached
ghere have won seventy-one, lost ﬁf-

teen and tied eight games.

In 1924 the Panthers won five, lost
three and tied one; in 1925 they won
ight and lost one; in 1926 they won

e
five, lost two and tied two; in 1927

,they won eight, lost one and tied one;

in 1928 they won six, lost two and
tied one; in 1929.,th,ey,ivoi1 nine and

glost one; in 1930 won six, lost two

Hartwig, regular guard on the Pitt
team for two years, lives in Benwood,
Vvest Virginia. He entered the Uni-
versity in 1930 and became a sub-
stitute guard on the freshman team
that year. He received an injury in
1931, which kept him out of both
football and the classroom. In 1932
he became a regular guard and the
past football season was rated one of
the best linemen in the country. He
was an almost unanimous choice on
the all—opponents teams chosen by
teams which met the Panthers.

The announcement that the Army
football team will come to Pittsburgh
in 1935 assures fans of at least one
treat for that year. The Army year
in and year out has one of the best
teams in the country. The Panthers
played the Army in 1931 and 1932, de-
The 1932
game at West Point, which Pitt won,
18 to 13, was one of the most thrilling
ever seen in the‘East.

Talks On Single Tax, l.VIcCready,
To Crowded Inquiry Forum

William McNair, mayor of Pitts—,
burgh, carried the single tax ﬁght to
the students of the University ‘Ned-
nesday and ably defended it for the
better part of the lunch hour in a
ra.pid—ﬁre discussion at Heinz House.

More than 300 skeptical students,
the largest number attending the In-
quiry forum for the past two semes-
ters, gathered at 12:30 o’clock. After
a short address by the mayor they
began shooting questions which kept
Mr. McNair going for the better part
of an hour.

“Why are you appointing Malone?”
“_How do you expect to carry out your
single tax?” “VVhat about this fellow
McCready‘?” were some of the things
the students wanted to know. '

To increase Pittsburgh’s revenue by
cutting off the flow of money to the
state and national governments
through voluntary temperance in
smoking and drinking was the theme
of Mr. McNair’s address.

. “I want to start a whiskey rebellion
in_Western Pennsylvania,” the Mayor
said. . “I want everybody to stop
drinking for about three weeks; smok-‘
mg, too. Then they’ll have to change
our taxes.” Mr. McNair believes that

“‘VVl1at we’re trying to do,” the
Mayor said, “is to take back for the
community what was originally creat-
ed by the community.”

“Pinchot doesn’t understand what

we here in Pennsylvania are trying to
do,” the ll/Iayor said, in answer to a
question. “He spends most of his
time in New York. I say he ought to
stay here.” Somebody asked just why
he was supporting Malone, since the
latter was formerly a. member of Gov-
ernor Pinchot’s cabinet. “He didn’t
stay there long. did he?” McNair an-
swered. “I think that’s a pretty good
 recommendation.”
 Pittsburgh"s playboy also came into
§-the discussion. “McCre-ady was the
Eonly person to offer me his services
free of charge,” McNair said. “Why
shouldn’t he get the job?”

Administration Shift

Will Take Effect
February 10

 

Two appointments in administrative
personnel, effective February 10, are
announced today by the office of Dr.
John G. Bowman, Chancellor of the
University. Dr. Vincent W. L-anfear,
director of the Downtown Division, be-
comes dean of men of the University.
J, Lloyd Mahony, assistant professor
of ﬁnance in the school of Business
Administration, becomes director of
the Downtown Division. ,

Dr. Lanfear came to the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh as professor of
ﬁnance in 1924. He has been head

1926. Before coming to Pittsburgh,
Dr. Lanfear taught three years at
Yale, one at Columbia, and four at
the University of Texas. He holds
B. A. and M. A. degrees from Texas
and the Ph. D. degree from Columbia.

It was during Mr. Lanfear’s admin-
istration as head of the £Downtov\.~n
Division that the work of the division
was expanded from courses limited
to business and administration sub-
jects only to include those in liberal
arts, education, engineering, and grad-
nate subjects as well. Dr. Lanfear
was one of the organizers of the Pitts-
burgh Council on Adult Education of
which organization he has been presi-
dent for the past two years. Robert

gers university, was the last dean of
men at the University of Pittsburgh.
Since his resignation two years ago,
the work has been handled by Walter
J. Rome, assistant dean of men.‘

Professor Mahony has been with
the University since 1924. Most of
his teaching in recent years has been
done in the downtown evening courses
in the Chamber of Commerce Build-
ing. He is a graduate of New York
university and taught courses in ii-
nance at that school for two years.
He then was affiliated with the cor-
porate trust department of the Guar-
anty Trust Company of New York
where he remained until coming to
Pittsburgh,. His teaching here has
been in the ﬁelds of corporation ﬁ-

nance, insurance, investments, and.
building‘ and loan operation.
Professor Maliony has been in»,

charge of instruction

stitute, since its organization in 1930. _

Those Trolley Rates

(Reprinted From An Early Pitt News Issue)

HE SLOVV, LUl‘.lBERING processes of demo-
Tci-at.ic government are apparently at work in
the activities of the Student council committee
seeking a reduction in trolley fare rates for stu-
dents. l\ian_v weeks have passed, many car-checks
have gone from the light-laden pockets of Pitt stu-
dents, and no word comes of any progress.

’l‘housands of students on the Pitt campus and
on the campuses of the other two schools interested
in the proposed reductions are still going without
lunch, still walliing long, unnecessary distances,
still waiting for something to be done. Twenty
ear checks a week is a tremendous burden, in these
times, for a college student. While college stu-
dents are still dependent, to a great extent, on sup-
port from family or friends, every penny counts,
and the longer the process of getting things done,
the harder the ordeal for those to whom college
means a great deal and for whom education is a se-
rious business.

There is a philosophy, held by certain people,
whicli maintains that unless men and women can
afford to attend college they should not be allowed
on university campuses. This philosophy, which
parallels ability to pay with ability to do, has long
since been swept into the a.shcans of worthless tra-
dition.

In a metropolitan center such as Pittsburgh, the
students who attend Pittsburgh’s colleges are the
sons and daughters of people who have never been
wea.lth_v——tl1e sons and daughters of bookkeeper-s,
bank clerks, small business men, ofﬁce employes,
and factory workers. To these students, hardship
at college is a reality, and success in their profes-
sions a goal worth walking a mile a day or missing
a meal for.

These are the students who never attend the Sc-
nior Ball or Junior Prom because they never had
the time to learn to dance or never had the money
with which to buy an evening gown. They are the
same students whose toiling fathers and mothers
have made them recognize the value of education,
the suffering in the steel mills and factories, the
destitute hopelessness of hungry families and set-
ttlemcnts. And these students are important, com-
prise a large part of our student population, and
deserve every consideration. They aren’t the well-
;I'ed and well-clothed college sophisticates who wear
the brand of liberalism if it will attract attention.
and get their names in the papers.

If there is a possible chance of rate reductions
we ought to get them. \Ve ought to get them as
soon as possible.
loss, advantage or disadvantage, company solvency
or insolvency. It is a question of whether or not
lnunan aspirations ought to be smothered by brass
car checks and how many more sacriﬁces will cer-
tain students have to make if they want to con-
tinue their education.

Progress In Registration
XCELLENT PROGRESS is being shown by the new

J system of advance registration which is being insti-
tuted at the University by John G. Quick, registrar.
Starting two years ago, Mr. Quick devised the system to
eliminate the congestion during a “regular” registration
period in the brief interim between semesters, and to
give students better opportunity to talk their schedules
over with deans, department heads, and professors. The
system has evolved in time until it has become :1. per-
manent fixture in the registration procedure at the Uni-
versity.

It is the ambition of many of us to see the system so
widely used here that registration for the ﬁrst semester
can be effected by undergraduates before they leave in
June for summer vacations. In this manner, taking three
weeks or a month at the end of the year, students would
again have the same advantages they have been given
in their registration for the second semester. The “reg-
ular” registration period in September would then be for
newly entering students and for those students having
difliculties in the early registration period.

VVe are conﬁdent that this, too, has been the ambitioh
of Mr. Quick. The student body appreciates his interest
and has responded well to the new system. Students
who have never before seen their professors or heads of
the departments out of class have ﬁnally been inside the
feared sancta sanctorum:

Students are taking greater interest in the selection of
courses and professors, heartened by the evidence that
the University administration has shown its interest by
allowing them greater‘ facilities and more time. Mr.
Quick and the members of his office are to be commend-
ed for their excellent progress in registration.

The Students Revolt
IMEHONORED CUSTOMS and ideas in educational
institutions throughout the nation are ﬁnding it diﬂi-

cult to be defended these days in the face of a period of
transition which has left most college and university stu-
dents well-nigh bewildered. There was a time when
mother and dad, uncle and grandfather had something to
say about the value of college—as a means to a better
place in society, a chance to nicely “loaf” one’s way
through life. Coming down from the primitive days in
which the escape from toil meant study of books, this
idea of ease following education has persisted in the
peasant-village mentalities which, sad to say, are. not yet
done away with in America and in the world.

College students are staging a revolt today. Not wav-
ing red ﬂags and singing “Internationale,” but revolting
against the idea that a sheepskin badge of culture en-
titles one to ease throughout the rest of his life, living
off the toil and effort of those who didn’t have the brains
or the nerve to go after a diploma. College students are
making up their minds, ﬁnally, that June is really Com-
mencement now—that they will commence to work as
they have never worked before. College students who
expect to survive in a competitive world following grad-
uation will now have to give more than they receive . . .
to produce from their educations, beneﬁts that will work
for the welfare of society, the society that made it pos-
sible for them to become educated.

This transformation in college students can be partly
attributed to the invasion of the college world by the
sons and daughters of the American proletariat . . . the
sons and daughters of workers. Most of them attending
on scholarships, many working their way through, these
students in many colleges can be seen leading the school
by strength of their superior ability and energy. The
next ﬁght in the academic world will be between the
“.original" student, the son or daughter of the college-
educated man, and the sons and daughters of the work-
ers. VVe’1l take sides with the latter when the new col-
lege generation is created.

.“Dear Friends And Gentle Hearts”
APPIER THAN LEARNING of the completion of
plans for the Stephen Collins Foster Memorial and
of the gift of original Foster manuscripts which will be
housed in the building, were Pitt students in discovering
a true friend of Pitt in Josiah Kirby Lilly. Although we
were heartened at the announcement of plans for the
building, the discovery that in Mr. Lilly cultural Amer-
ica has found a “dear friend and gentle heart” makes the
erection of the memorial a ﬁtting tribute not only to
America's greatest composer but a tribute to men and
women who unselﬁshly devote their interests in the cul-
tural welfare of their nation. Mr. Lilly's collection of
Foster material is an outstanding contribution to Amer-
ica’s musical history.

Happy, too, must be Mr. Lilly as he leafs through the
original manuscripts of “Old Black Joe,” “My Old Ken-
tucky Home,” and many others and realizes that at his
ﬁngers is the pulse of the nation as Stephen Collins Fos-
fer recorded it. It took a genius to put into notes and
measure the pulse-beats of his time: love, nostalgia, ad-
venture, and humaneness as he found it. And it takes
men of character, men who ﬁnd in art and music some-
thing of man's immortality, to recognize that without
preserving our arts, letters, and music, civilization de-
feats its purpose. Of these men, in America, of the fore-
most is Mr. Lilly.

The University, its officers, faculty, and students can
never thank Mr. Lilly enough. Cu1l:ura.l America, the
University of Pittsburgh two hundred years from now,
and students many years hence will owe a. real debt to
Mr. Lilly. And many years from now, as students in the
Foster Memorial Little Theater sing:

“I’m comin’, I’m comin’,

Though my head is be-ndin’ low,

I hear those gentle voices calling . . .
on Stephen Collins Foster’s birthday, let them realize
that genius produces music, art, and letters, and it takes
“dear friends and gentle hearts,” men of character and
vision, to know the value of culture and preserve and
prolong that heritage.

THE PITT NEWS

FRIDAY, JANUARY 19, 1934

Dear Effiie :

orchids to the mayor of this city.

Effluvia   

By Saul Weisberg

As a student of the University of Pittsburgh, I think that you
might among your other rabid emanations scatter a few scallions or

about petty grievances of the federal government and the ofﬁcious
[foolishness of VVashington, but not once, to my knowledge, have you
mentioned that the city of Pittsburgh is undergoing one of the great-

For weeks you have been ranting

otherwise.

The downtown papers have been
literally ﬁlled with news about Mc-
Nair, while you have prettily dis-
dained either to condemn or com-
mend him. Perhaps in your sage
ruminating you have decided to wait
until some great results show them-
selves; perhaps you consider yourself
above declaiming or exclaiming for a
mere city official; perhaps you ﬁnd it
unnecessary to augment the facetious
and exaggerated accounts of the daily
papers; -~erhaps, too, you don’t know
what to say.

There must be some reason for
your ignoring him. After a quarter of
a century of
graft, corruption, and general bad
politics, a new regime has been insti-
tuted. Just as in national politics,
the administration in power during
the economic depression had lost so
much power, prestige, and conﬁdence
that it failed to reestablish itself in
the elections, Such a change, in it-
self, would furnish an almost unlim-
ited list of discussion topics, but the
fact that the man at the head of this
new party is as unusual as he is, can-
not be ignored in a column of the
type you conduct. Surely the stu-
dents who follow the mayor’s policies
and activities in the papers and ﬂock
to hear him when he speaks on
campus would be interested to know
what a fellow student thinks of him.
Certainly you, who would probably
classify yourself as a political analyst,
should have more than a little to say
about the new Democratic mayor of
Pittsburgh_

0. K.

The writer is quite porrect in one
thing that he says. Thus far, I have
not known what to say, I was not
even sure that Mayor McNair was a
good humorist, although some
dent has wisecracked that “Joe Cook
complained of unfair competition in
Pittsburgh.” Cook was afraid of the
attendance at the Nixon, however.
Other more unbiased observers have
found the new mayor very amusing.

Personally, I think it is a mistake
to look upon Mr. McNair as exclusive-
ly a. humorist. The newspapers have
broadcast such an impression but the
newspapers may not always have
been fair. Mr. McNair is a single
taxer and if there is one feature of a
single taxer that is ‘outstanding, it is
his dead seriousness about the form
of taxation he advocates, An honest
single taxer, such as} Mr. McNair, has
little room for humor when it comes
to his pet theory.

It is the singlef-iclax theory which
evidently is coloring all the mayor’s
activities This is quite natural. The
single taxer looks upon that policy as
a theory which can be the basis of an
entire economic system. He believes
that political and economic policies
can be derived from the single tax.
Thus Mayor McNair’s rather aston-
ishing proposal last Wednesday that
the people of Western Pennsylvania
should undertake a new whiskey and
tobacco rebellion-—the proposal was
dictated by the idea that such a re-
bellion would force state and national
government to adopt the single tax
system. Thus, also, Mayor McNair’s
seemingly sincere attempt to salvage
the men in Shantytown was a logical
evolution of the proposition that land
should be used by the community. Of
course, the mayor immediately
spiraled off into the notion of appoint-
ing Harrison McCready as director of
the work, a.nd Mr. McNa.ir was in a
mess of trouble. But the way to un-
derstand Mr. McNair’s activities,
aside from his jokes, is to realize that
he is a sincere and whole hearted
single taxer, and that his actions are
almost always derivatives of his be-
lief in the single tax theory. This is
true of Mr. McNair in the same way
that it is true of a Communist, whose
every act. connected with a social
policy, is dictated by the general
theories and attitudes he possesses as
a Communist,

The single tax theory has become
a lively topic of discussion since
Mayor McNair’s election. Not a great
many people understand it or know
much about it. I may as well be
frank and say that I know very little
about it. Yet there are certain funda-
mental propositions which seem
rather evident The theory is found-
ed, I believe, on the general proposi-
tion that any increase in the value of
land is a result of the collective
actions of the community, and not be-
cause of the work of the owner of the
land. That is, the rent that an owner
of a piece of property on Fifth ave-
nue is receiving should not properly
accrue to the individual owner. The
increase in the value and the rent of
the Fifth avenue plot can be attri-
buted to the grand accumulative pro-
ductive actions of the community, and
the increase should be given to the
community, The single taxer would
obtain this increase, or economic rent,
for the community by a heavy tax on
land. The income from this taxation
would be great enough to cover all
the expenses of the various govern-
ments in this country. -

The fundamental criticism to which
the single tax theory is subject lies
in its implicit support of the capital-
istic system and unhampered indi-
vidual enterprise. The single tax
would perhaps prevent unearned in-
crement of land and it would remove
parasites living on unearned rent.
But it would make no attempt to
hamper or control in any way the
growth of large industrial combina-
tions, such combinations bringing con-
centration of wealth. Unequal distri-
,bution of income is the basic defect
‘aof our present society, but the single
gtaxers pay no attention to it. They
[are satisﬁed with the present indus-
ltrial set up, if not with the status of

land. The single tax would not pre-
vent dep-ressions or poverty or vast
Iluxury, because it would have little

est changes in its history, political 01%

can be suggested that good will be

effect toward levelling income_ And
equalling incomes remains the para-
mount object for which we must work.

Another objection which might be
raised against the, single tax lies in
the fact that economic rent is in-
tangible. That is, the value of a plot
of land and the increase in value of
land are relative things, which can-
not be objectively measured. They
ﬂuctuate under varying conditions.
One of the University professors,
pointing this out, compared economic
rent to good will. Good will is, at
present, a large part of the value
resident in corporate securities.l

of the value of that stock is due to
community good will towards that
company, But good will is obviously
Yet, it has value and it

taxed in the same way that economic
rent be taxed. As a matter of fact,

the satiric economist, Thorstein
Veblen, once sarcastically said that
it might not be a bad idea. Yet, it is
obvious that as soon as good will was
taxed, it might disappear or the rat-
ings of its amount would vary tre-
mendously.. The same is almost as
true, of taxation of the surplus value
of land.

Mayor McNair is hardly likely ever
to be successful with his single tax
notions. But the single tax theory is
going to be a hindrance to many city
acts which are necessary. And Mr.
McNair is going to receive much ad-
verse publicity as long as he continues
to allow his single tax theory to rule
his other ideas. I do think, however,
that the mayor will cut down on his
cut ups. He knows that the papers
are getting the better of him.

Shapira, Banks
Make Mid-West
Debating Tour

Murphy Will Accompany Men
In Ten-Day Tour Through
Ohio, Indiana, Illinois

Saul F. Shapira, C34, and Edwin P.
Banks, C35, will take the ﬁrst major
trip of the year for the Men’s Debat-
ing association, coaches of the group

announced this week. _

Extending from next Saturday, Jan-
uary 27, and continuing through Feb-
ruary 5, the trip will include nine
schools in the Mid-west. The major-
ity of the discussions _ will revolve
about the question, “Resolved: That
the essential features of the NIRA
should be made permanent.”

Each year, it is the policy of the
association to
tours. The Mid-west one at the end
of this month will be followed early in
April by a trip through Eastern Penn-
sylvania, New Jersey, and New York.
In addition, several week-end jaunts
are planned for March.

Dr. W. M. Parrish and Richard Mur-
phy, coaches of the squad, announced
their selections after several try-out
contests before women’s organizations
in the Cistrict. Mr. Murphy will ac-
company the tea.1n, who will travel by
automobile.

Shapira, who is manager of the as-
sociation, is rounding out his third
year of work on the team. Last year,
as a junior, he took the April eastern
trip, and was the most active local
debater on the squad. VVhile a soph-
omore, he was one of the discussion,
leaders of the Intercollegiate Politicall
conference which presented a “Roose-
velt program” for national action.

lBanks, assistant manager, accompa-
nied Shapira East last season. Now
a junior, he has debated since his
freshman year.

The itinerary which Banks has
planned includes debates on Saturday,
January 27, with the City College of
Detroit; January 28. University of To-
ledo; January 29, Michigan State Col-
lege, at East Lansing; January 30, De

$15,000 Worth Of Jewels,
Stones, Minerals On Exhibit

 

Approximately $15,000 worth of
gems, stones and minerals are now
on exhibition in the laboratory room
of the geology department. Professor
Henry Leighton, head of the geology
department, announces that visitors
are welcome to view the exhibition,

The Smith collection of minerals,
which forms an
the display, was given by two friends
of the University, the Smith sisters,
who had collected valuable minerals
and specimens, When the University
was located on the North Side, the
collection was housed in a specially
furnished room. Later it was moved
to the new quarters of the geology de-
partment, on the upper ﬂoor of State
Here the collection was on
exhibition from 1908 to 1920.

When the geology department was
moved to the barracks on the hill
in back of Trees gymnasium, the col-

important part of

lection was taken along. It was dis-
played in this place for about ten
years. With the transfer of the
geology department to the twelfth
ﬂoor of the Cathedral, the collection
was rearranged and the old and
valuable walnut cases for the display
reﬁnished and two additional cases
have been built for the new exhibi-
tion.

The collection includes some large
and rare mineral groups such as
ﬂuorite, quartz crystals, amethyst and
petriﬁed wood. There are also some
crude and cut precious stones. This
part of the collection has recently
been augmented by the purchase of
some beautiful Chinese carvings in
jade, carmelian and agate, and by
the purchase of some intensely inter-
esting cut stones from the private
collection of George F. Kunz, the well-
known gem expert from Tiffany's in
New York.

Switchboard Operators Do

 

By Ruth Cohen
Busy as a bee? If you’ve ever
watched the telephone switchboard
operators at Room 103, State hall,

you’ll think a bee is a lackadaisical,
good—for-nothing lazy bones (if a bee
has bones). They emphatically prove
the old axiom that the hand is quicker
than the eye. Watching these two
young women plugging wires in and
out with deft movements, the by-
stander can only feel inadequate and
superﬂuous,

The scene at ﬁrst glance appears
very simple. The room is small, al-
most completely taken up by the
three switchboards, three chairs and
a coat rack. The switchboards are
covered with lights, plugs and
switches. Before them sit the op-
erators, earphones and speaking tube
on, magically connecting Pittsburgh
with Harrisburg, Philadelphia and
where not, and enabling persons in
the Cathedral to talk with those in
the gymnasium.

If you’ve ever sworn, -silently or
aloud, because the operator seemed
inexcusably slow, or unnecessarily
peeved, you haven’t realized the com-

“ petition you are up against. There are

.108 Un'versit ta ' * ' -
1. Rushing season shall extend over a D9-l 1 y S tlonb and SIX out

going extensions. To connect them
there are ﬁfteen plugs on each board.

 

‘For each plug there is a light and;
a switch. When you lift the receiver‘

on the Pitt News phone, the News’
light ﬂashes on, the operator puts a
plug in the “drop,” moves the cor-
responding switches and sings “Yes?”
You say, “Heinz House,” she plugs in
the wire, moves another switch and
some one says, “Hello.” When you
hang up, the light goes out, and she
pulls out the plugs.

Since there are approximately 3,500
calls a day, and at times only one of
the two operators is working, you
can imagine the speed with which
they must work. There are 16,000
calls going out over the dial in one
month and during the time that one
number is being dialed, the operator
can answer six or eight University
calls. To add to the congestion, in-
structors are often anywhere but in
their own ofﬁces. Having been here
for eighteen years, Mrs, Loughrey, the
chief operator, knows just where the
wandering professors will probably be.

The number of calls has increased
greatly in the past few years, and
the number of University stations has
increased from sixty in 1915 to the

present 168, twenty-two of which are,

Panthers Set To Halt Sensational N otre _Dame Quintet Here Tomorrow

South Benders Are Undefeated
Since Middle Of Last Season

 

Coach Keogan Brings
High-Scoring Team
Of Veterans

IV
By Charles A. Ruch

Notre Dame will come to the
Stadium tomorrow night with one of
the finest basketball teams in the his-
tory of the school and what is per-
haps the outstanding team of the
country this season. In the midst of
a victory streak of 22 straight
games, the Irish will oppose the
Panthers in a game that promises to
be an outstanding attraction of the
local season.

Starting in the middle of last sea-
son and continuing on through their
eleven games this season, the Irish
have bested every opponent they have
met. Victory number 22 was
gained last Saturday night at the ex-
pense of the Butler university passers,
to the tune of 37-17, before a crowd
of 8,500. It was this same Butler
team which handed the Panthers a
lacing early in the season.

N otre Dame has practically the same
team in action this year that opposed
the Panthers last season with the ex-
ception of the 1933 captain, Baldwin.
Big. “Moose” Krause is again back at
center and is playing a brand of ball
which stamps him as one of the best

pivot men in the country. The battle
between Krause and Pitt’s Claire
Cribbs will attract a great deal of the
fans’ attention, as it will be remem-
bered that Cribbs’ outplaying Krause
here last year formed the margin of
the Pitt victory_

Other Irish stars who appeared here
before are Voegele, Jim Newbold and
Leo Crowe. The former is a long-
armed forward, who has accounted
for plenty of ﬁeld goals in the eleven
Irish games this season. The latter
two boys are guards of sterling de-
fensive ability. Crowe stood out par-
ticularly in the thrilling clash with
M_ichigan State when he garnered ten
points to lead the scorers of both
teams.

Incidentally the Notre-Dame—Micl1i-
gan State game was one that will
long be remembered in the midwest.
It was in this game that the Irish
came dangerously close to having their
winning streak shattered, coming out
ahead by only one point after three
hectic overtime periods of play. That
the South Benders have a ﬁghting ball
club is demonstrated by the fact that

they trailed their rivals by three
points near the close of the ﬁnal
overtime period and yet won out.

It was Krause who dropped in two
short ﬁeld goals to down the Mich-
iganders.

Coach Keogan has discovered a
crack forward in the sophomore,
Peters. This lad is fitting in very
well with the Irish system of play
and has Shown great promise in his
ﬁrst season on the varsity. Keogan
also has a. better-than-average for-
ward, Jordan, who may be shoved in-
to the breach at any moment and play
a dependable game. Other reserves
who have seen considerable service
this year are Ireland and Ford, guards,
and Allen, a forward.

Coach Carlson is expected to send
his regular starting combination into
the game to oppose the brilliant Irish.
(‘ribbs will be at the center post, Mc-
Camant and VV. Hughes at forwards,
and Ochsenhirt and C, Hughes will
again play the guard positions. This
lineup seems to be improving with
each game and there is no indication
that the Irish will catch the Cats un-
awares.

A preliminary game between the
Pitt freshmen and the strong Kiski
quintet will provide the excitement
for the early arrivers,

The probable varsity lineup:

Third Handicap
Meet Scheduled

Trackmen Prepare For Coming
AMA, Collegiate Events

The mile run has been added to the
schedule for this week’s handicap
track and ﬁeld meet this afternoon at
the Track house. Other events are
the shot-put, the high jump, the broad
jump, the pole vault and the low
hurdles.

The third novice and varsity meet
will get under way at 4 o’clock.
Coach Olson has been busy this week
rearranging the handicaps for his
men, so that none of them will cop
any event consistently. All novices are
eligible for the competition and al-
ways stand a. good chance of beating
out the varsity men with the aid of
the handicaps.

Preparations are being continued
for the annual AMA indoor meet,
scheduled for the Track house next
Thursday and Friday evenings, En-
tries are coming in steadily for the
meet and a good crowd is expected.
Working out with the Pitt trackers
are Kistler, a former Butler univer-
sity star, and Work, formerly of Pur-
due, both of whom are anxious to an-
nex several of the AMA titles.

The Pitt team is steadily shaping
up for its first indoor meet in Feb-
ruary and a good percentage of the
Panthers are expected to be entered
in the meet next week.

Four Champions
On Frosh Team

Backstroker, Breaststroker, Divers
Were Scholastic Stars

The freshman swimming team has
among its members four champions,
George Meyers, Harry Faust, Alex
Muzyk and John Stiranka. Meyers, a
diver on the freshman team, was the
Interscholastic diving champion in
Canton and also had a place on the
team from McKinley High, which won

the Pitt Interscholastics last year.

Alex Muzyk won the city breast-
stroke championship last year, and
took a second in the Interscholastics,
which took place here last year. There
was some error on the part of the
judges in his race, as any number of
witnesses will testify.

The winner of the city high school
back-stroke championship, John Stir-
anka, is also one of the outstanding
swimmers on the fresh squad. Aside
from swimming backstroke, Stiranka
is also a ﬁne breaststroker.

Harry Faust won the city diving
championship last year. Faust and
Muzyk, both members of the fresh-
man football team, are counted upon
heavily to take places in the coming
meets.

As well as the fresh are represented
in diving, backstroke and breast-
stroke, a winning team cannot be had
unless more free style material can
be found. So far Harry Geyer has
been the only freshman free style
man to show any amount of swimming
ability, the remaining members of the
squad, although their work shows con-
siderable improvement, are hardly
ready to compete with other freshman
teams. Keck, Hogsett, Hivelty, Heid
and Schaeffer, if they continue to im-
prove, may help form a team able to
give any prep or high school team a
close race.

Any student interested in swimming
or students who have had any com-
petitive swimming experience are
urged to report to Coach Corr at
Trees pool Monday, Tuesday or Fri-

:day at 5 o'clock.

Swimming Team
To Meet Carnegie

 

-First Collegiate Competition For

Either Team; Coach Corr
Will Use Entire Squad

On Wednesday at 5 o'clock the Pitt
swimming team will oppose the Car-
negie Tech team in the ﬁrst collegiate
meet for either team, The meet was
originally set for Trees pool but the
place was later changed to the Tartan
pool. This will no doubt give the
Tech team a. slight advantage inas-
much as the Panthers are unaccus-
tomed to swimming in a 25-foot pool.
The pool in Trees gym measures
only 20 feet.

Coach Pat Corr will try to use his
entire squad in this meet. In using
his entire squad Coach Corr will be
able to call on a fresh swimmer for
every event. Seniors, however, may
be slightly favored, a few of the more
versatile three-year men may swim
in two events.

Last night Coach Corr was still
undecided about his starting lineup.
In the 50-yard dash, a race in which
he has a large number of possible
starters, he will use two of the fol-
lowing three: Paul Stinner, Herman
Adlersberg or Charles Chambers.

In the 220 either Denny or Lewis
or Denny and Swazuk w1T1 go at the
starters’ signal. 111 the dive, John
Carik and Joseph Schmeiler will per-
form. John Hanna is almost certain
to swim the 440, and VVilliam Swazuk
will be the second man, providing he
does not swim in the 220.

The two starting positions in the
150-yard backstroke are between Rus-
sell Lindberg, Joe Jones and William
Swazuk. Herman Adlersberg and Jo-
seph Schmeiler are the only two men
who so far designated to swim in the
200—yard breaststroke race. The 100-
yard free style starting assignment
will be ﬁlled by two of the following
four swimmers: Jack Denny, Charles
Chambers, Joseph Madden and Charles
Ruhe.

The 400-yard relay race will be com-
posed of four of the following:
Chambers, Lindberg, Hanna, Stinner,
Ruhe, Madden and Lewis.

,Pitt To Lead National

Pitt Beats Tgch
In Listless Game

Rigg and Cribbs High Scorers;
Carlson Starts Seconds

Pitt’s second-string ﬁve was not
quite good enough to hold the Tech
Tartans in check at the Stadium Tues-
day night, but the ﬁrst stringers were
injected into the game in plenty of
time to assure an easy Panther vic-
tory. The score of Pitt’s eighteenth

Starting out in whirlwind fashion,
the Skibos rode over the Panther
second-stringers for the whole of the
ﬁrst quarter. When Tech led by a
seven-point total, Coach Carlson sent
in Skip Hughes of the ﬁrst ﬁve and
sent in the rest a few moments later
when the Skibos sported an eight-
point advantage.

From the moment the ﬁrst stringers
were in the game the result was

never in doubt. It was only a question

of time for the Panthers to catch up,
although a long shot by Ted Rigg,
high-point man of the evening, gave
Tech a two-point advantage at the
half.

The second half of the game brought
forth some sloppy playing by both
teams. Tech, whose long shots had
been their best offensive weapon
throughout the ﬁrst period, for some
reason ceased tossing them from far
out. Otherwise the Skibos didn’t have
a show, for they could not pierce the
Pitt defense with their passing at-
tack. Pitt’s passing and shooting was

good enough to put them easily ahead,

Rigg, Tech guard, played a heady
brand of ball for the visitors and
hung up six ﬁeld goals. He was woe-
fully weak at the foul line, however,
as were several other Skibos. Out-
standing for Pitt was Claire Cribbs,
who at times showed ﬂashes of his
last season’s ball-handling form and
garnered. twelve points for his eve-

ning’s total. Macalka, Tech sophomore I
forward, turned in some very pretty’

long ﬁeld goals and played a good
all—around game.

Faculty Bowlers
Issue Challenge
To Frat League

Winner Of Greek Tournament
Must Prove Alley Ability
To Professors, Deans

Once again the faculty bowling team
has thrown down the glove! Each
year at this time, that hearty sextet
of pin pounders who represent the
University faculty are in the habit of
throwing down the glove.

It is up to either the Phi Kappas or
the Phi Delta Thetas to accept the
outright challenge, depending upon
which fraternity wins in the ﬁnals of
their pi11 tournament. Rumor hath it
that the winners will accept the chal-
lenge. They had better.

The annual faculty-fraternity cham-
Dionship bowling event has been going
Two years ago
the faculty rollers bested the Pi
Lambda Phis and last year the Omega
Deltas gained revenge for the fraters.
No prize is connected with the af-
fair, although last year the Omega
Delts feted their opponents at a din-
ner before the match, which may or
may not prove something.

The men who comprise the faculty
team are J. G. Quick, registrar; Jules
Labarthe, of the Mellon Institute;
Miles Jones, of the School of Business
Administration; Ted Biddle, assistant
to the dean of men; Walter Rome,
assistant dean of men; and Carl Dis-
telhorst, of the School of Business Ad-
ministration. Any other faculty can-
didates who realize their bowling
ability may keep it to themselves as
far as the above six are concerned,
for this sextet is “in on the ground
ﬂoor" of the annual challenge affair.

All of which leaves it directly up
to the fraters who win in the bowling
tournament. They can prove their
right to rule over the Oakland alleys
only by downing the faculty stars in
fair combat. If the Greek boys “ain’t
skeered" they may arrange for the
hectic tilt with Mr. Distelhorst, who
intimates that he may change his
title from “captain” to “manager” un-
less his scores show a little improve-
ment,

A good example of this weight paring
was demonstrated at one of the In-
tercollegiate thampionships a few
years back. It was learned by several
Pitt representatives at the tourna-
ment that the man who was the star
lightweight of the past season once
weighed over 155 pounds. How did
he take off this weight?

First of all. he did all of his train-
ing in several suits of sweat clothes.
This was always followed by ﬁve
rounds of shadow boxing in the
“steam room.” Several laps around
the track and ﬁve rounds of bag
punching, coupled with boxing and

the 19; I exercises eventually reduced the manl

to a mere 138 pounds. However he

- had to be quite careful of his diet and ,

subsisted for practically the entire
season on weak tea and toast.
Fortunately for the Pitt boxers,
Coach Joe Orsini has not seen ﬁt to
damage his men in this manner.
Orsini’s standing maxim has been to
the effect that no man should take
off excess poundage to make a lighter

'2-lass limit. This system is the best:
