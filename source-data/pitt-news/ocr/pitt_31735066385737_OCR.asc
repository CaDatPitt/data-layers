Responding to an allegation
that the university failed to follow-
up on a $2.5 million offer from a
local businessman, officials have
announced a full investigation
into Pitt’s endowment procedure.

 According to a column

published Sunday in The
Pittsburgh Press, Sharpsburg
resident Lou Meyers contacted
Pitt’s development department
in 1985, outlining a plan in which
he would donate $2.5 million in
scholarships. However, Meyers

......................   PHTSBURGH

said that Pitt’s lack of response to
his offer forced him to give the
funds instead to Point Park
College.

“What we are going to do is
have our campaign counsel, who
we retain to be objective and
neutral and to view things
critically, present us with what
the facts are on this,” said Bruce
Loessin, vice-president for
university relations and
development, “some of which

we know and maybe more of
’ which they can find out and give

a report to the president on it to
see if there is anything about it

that would affect our program.”

Meyers proposed donating the
money for scholarships that
would cover 80 percent of all
costs for selected students. After
one initial meeting with the
development offr ce and receiving
a positive letter from Pitt President
Wesley Posvar, Meyers said that
the university ignored his
numerous phone calls.

“This whole thing transpired
in [nineteen] eighty-four or eighty-
five and appeared at the time to
have a successful resolution as
far as we can tell from the files.
What transpired from that time is
something we will look into,”
Loessin said Monday at the

university senate council meeting.

When The Press called Pitt to
inquire about what had happened
since 1985, May Ann Aug, assistant
vice-president for university
relations said that the Meyers
case looked like “benign neglect”
on the part of development and
that there was once “a little more
laid—back attitude” in the
department.

However, Loessin questioned
the accuracy of The Press’s
column. “This wasn’t a news story.
It was an article done by a
columnist. They deal in sayings
and things. I’m not sure how
totally accurate all the information

   

VOLUME EIGHTY-FOUR, ISSUE NINETY,-ONE

‘Benign neglect’ costs Pitt $2. 5 million endowment

S Byjenifer Crook and

in there was," he said. .

I Loessin said that this incident
does not typify what he calls the
“nationally known effort that the
university has undertaken to raise
funds.” Pitt began a $225 million
fundraiser in 1987 and has
collected $212 million to date.

“This is a very generous man
who has done something very
wonderful for this community and‘
for Point Park College and we
congratulate them on this
success,” he said, “That ought to
really be the point of this story
rather than something that may
have happened here.”

Outstanding students, faculty honored by university

By Jeff Tatusko
Staff Writer

Robert T osatto already knew
that he was going to be awarded
the Facts and Comparisons Award
in Pharmacy before going to
yesterday’s annual Honors

 Convocation. But when he got

there, he got a surprise.

Tosatto, a senior in the School
of Pharmacy, also won the E. D.
Locke Award for the outstanding
graduating senior who is devoted
to the high standards of the
University of Pittsburgh.

“I was rather sur-prised, in fact,”
he said. “I really didn’t expect

5‘ that I had a chance after meeting

with the board.”

T osatto was one of many Pitt
students and faculty to receive
awards at the ceremony, which
was held in the Carnegie Music
Hall. ’

Pitt President Wesley Posvar
started the event by calling on the
students to become leaders of

iii»-their generation.

“You are going to be leaders in
remaking the city of Pittsburgh,”
he said. “You will also play an

 

increasing role in the environment
around us.” Posvar also said that
the students were a “force of
wisdom and good that will
transcend national boundaries.”
Provost Donald Henderson

then presented the ﬁrst awards, I

which went to the academic
undergraduate honorees. “The
university takes great pride in
honoring you today,” he told
them. I
Eric Maisel, winner of four
awards, including the British
Marshall Scholar Award, gave the
response for the awardees.
“Ours is not a static world,” he
said. “We have to develop the
ability to leave the world a better
place than  we found it.”
After the presentation of the
graduate and professional
academic honorees, the winners
of awards for student leadership
were recognized. Among these
awardees were Tosatto and Gil
Borok, who was awarded Senior
of the Year.
But students were not the only
ones that were recognized during

_ the ceremony. A group of faculty

members was also recognized

for outstanding achievements.
In the faculty response,
Reginald McKnight, who also

won four awards, including the _

Kenyon Review Award for
Literary Excellence, told the
audience that the awards were
great, but also warned them,
“Don’t get big-headed.”

An honorary degree was given
to Dr. Leon M. Lederman, a Nobel
Prize-winning physicist from the
University of Chicago. In his
acceptance speech, Lederman
gave some statistics showing the
lack of scientific knowledge
among American students.

“In a test of ninth—grade
students, students in the United
States ﬁnished 13th out of 13
countries tested in biology, 11th
in chemistry andninth in physics,”
he said. ’

Lederman also called on the
awardees to raise the global
standard of living. “The benefits
we have in America are only felt
by 20 to 25 percent of the global
population,” he said. “The rest
live in basic poverty. We must
‘design a way to raise the world’s
standard of living.”

Subtle sexism shown in schools

By Mary Beth Marklein
©Copyright 1990, USA TODAY/
Apple College Information
Network

They read from the same
textbooks and sit in the same
classrooms, yet girls are often
shortchanged in education,
studies show, because teachers
pay more attention to boys.

Most educators don’t do it on
purpose; they’re just unaware of
it, say Myra and David Sadker,
professors at American University
in Washington, D.C., who conduct
workshops on this subtle form of
sexism around the country.

And what they show teachers
is that educators, knowingly or
not: '

— Force boys to work out
problems they don’t understand,

     

but tell girls what to do. ‘‘It
reinforces the old stereotypes that
girls must rely on others and boys
must stand on their own,” says
Brenda Cloyd, who heads a
genderequity program within the
Department of Education in
Virginia. .

— Are easier on girls when
dispensing discipline ,9 “When they
get into the business world, (boys)
are more adept at receiving
criticism,” Cloyd says. “They learn
to deal with failure, which we've
all got to deal with.”

——- Reward girls for non-
acadernic achievements, such as
neat penmanship or getting along
with others. “Grades are given
sometimes for politeness, as kind
of a compromise,” Myra Sadker
says. The result, she adds, “leads
to a false sense of security,” and

may explain why girls consistently

get better report cards butearn '

lower SAT scores than boys.
But the Sadkers also help
teachers understand why this
happens. Based on their own
four—year study of sexism in
classrooms from grade school
through graduate school, the
Sadkers found boys are:

— ‘Eight times more likely to
call out in class.

— Twice as likely to demand
the teacher's help , to be seen as
model students or to be called on
or praised by teachers. ‘

— Five times more likely to
receive the most attention from
teachers. 2

When teachers do call on girls,
they give them considerably less
feedback, positive or negative,

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, March 15, 1990

By Jacinta Marie Dvorak
Staff Writer

For a disabled professor at the
University of Pittsburgh, life can
be challenging at times.

Pitt’s Office of Affirmative

“Action reported that in 1987, there

were seven disabled faculty
members at Pitt. In 1988, that
number increased to nine, and in
1989, the number of disabled
decreased to eight. Affirmative
Action acknowledges the fact that
all disabled faculty members may
choose not to be identiﬁed. These
numbers come from a survey in

L. which faculty members were

asked to identify themselves as
being disabled.

David Harris, Ph.D., a professor
in the English department, gets
around campus in a motorized
wheelchair. However, his
disability does not get in the way
of his classroom performance. In
fact, Harris has a better attendance

.~ record than most of Pitt’s faculty.

In the two years that he has been
teaching at Pitt, he said has only
been late once-. '

“I tell my students to give me
20 minutes to be late,” Harris
stated. “I have a pretty good
record, though.”

Harris may be late because he

depends on outside
transportation to get to work.
ACCESS, the service that provides
his transportation, is funded by
the Port Authority of Allegheny
County. Harris said a number of
problems accompany the
transportation service.

ACCESS has a policy that only
allows users to be ﬁve minutes
late before the shuttle leaves
without them. This policy is based
on the actual time that the shuttle
arrives. Complaints against the
service are only valid if the shuttle
is more than 20 minutes off-
schedule. And Harris said these
are just a few of the problems
with ACCESS, which range from
delays to unsafe driving practices.

“They don’t make me mad;
they make me furious,” said
Harris.

ACCESS also has a policy which
states that all of its passengers
must make reservations to use
the service at least one day in
advance. This causes problems if
Harris wants to go somewhere
spontaneously, such as returning
back to campus to work or to
meet a student.

John F. Karns, Ph.D., is an
associate professor in the law of
justice program at Pitt’s Graduate
School of Public and International
Affairs. Karns has seen a lot of
changes since he attended _Pitt as
an undergraduate.

“I was the second one in the
University, of Pittsburgh in a
wheelchair. My roommate was
the first,” Karhs said. Karns lived
in the dormitories during his
student years at Pitt.

significant effort to accommodate
the handicapped. Just because
there are some problems that
have not been remedied does
not mean that many others have
not been remedied,” Karns stated.

Karns also commented on the
perceptions he feels many people
may have about the handicapped.

“There is a great deal of
acceptance the particular
handicap, although not

completely discarded, becomes
much less important than one’s
qualities as a faculty member
and colleague.”

Karns practiced law for a
number of years before he turned
to teaching. Karns believes that
his outside experience has
brought meaningful insight into
the classroom. He feels that he

Karns served on a committe

been a very strong effort, [but]
they can’t do everything.”
Around campus there are some
minor problems that Harris found
he must adjust to. For instance,
the bookstore has narrow aisles
that are difficult to move around
in. Also, the site at the Cathedral
of Learning where Harris gets
picked up is not the same entrance
where the exit for the
handicapped is located. On days
when the weather is inclement,

Sexism ,

Continued from page 1
the Sadkers say.

“In short, males are the more
dominant ﬁgures in the classroom
and they receive more of the
valuable" educational resources
—-I the teacher’s time and
attention,” David Sadker says.

For girls, the consequences go
beyond academidachievement.
By the time young women reach
post-secondary levels, those who
do speak up in class frequently
couch their responses with self-
effacing language. » .

“When you’re actively involved,
your achievement is likely to go
up, and so is your self-esteem,"
Myra Sadker says. “Education is
not a spectator sport.”

Federal mandates have targeted
most of the overt forms of sex
discrimination, the researchers

Title IX, the landmark 1972
law that established a women’s
equity program within the
Department of Education, has
helped eliminate such problems
as male-only athletics programs.

More recently, a 1984 law
encourages women to pursue
vocational education for jobs
traditionally held by men, such
as auto mechanics.

Still, the Sadkers contend that
educators aren’t angry enough
about the problem.

In an article published last
year in Educational Leadership,
the Sadkers, with Arlington, Va.

L intermediate school ‘principal
' Sharon Steindam,

call such
inequities “a national blind spot. ”
Their analysis of 183 articles about
education reform printed in
professional journals from 1983
through 1986 found that only 1

percent of the content dealt with
the problem of sex bias.

Education groups acknowledge
the problem, but are working to
correct it.

“We make sure our people
have information on that,” says
Barbara Van Blake, director of
human rights for the American
Federation of Teachers.

Bernice Sandler, of the
Association of American Colleges,
says almost 25,000 requests have
come in for a 1982 report on sex
bias. Her group is now working
on a guide to help colleges change
professors’ behavior.

In their workshops, the Sadkers
found that teachers can
significantly diminish the problem
of favoring boys with conscious
effort.

They encourage educators to
videotape their classroom

behavior and then analyze it
objectively for biases. Most
teachers, they add, are eager to
change behavior — once they
can see it.

John Phillips, a teacher at
Thomas Jefferson Intermediate
School in Arlington, Va., recalls
the day a colleague pointed out
that all of the inspirational
quotations he had tacked on the
wall referred to he, him or his.
Not one mentioned girls or
women. A

“Over time, people are
bombarded with messages that
seem to be only referring to men, ”
he reasoned. “What I’m trying to
communicate by these messages
would be somehow lessened if I
didn’t somehow recognize that.”

Experts say parents cah help
monitor the problem of sexism in
the classroom.

—- During school visits, observe
how male and female role models
are represented on bulletin
boards, displays or
materials. Tell the teacher or
principal if you detect a
disproportionate ratio.

-9 Watch for clues at parent- I

teacher conferences. If the teacher
focuses on your daughter’s neat
handwriting and polite demeanor,
for example, make it clear that
you’re also interested in her
academic progress.

— Don't reinforce stereotypes.
If you’re the mother and your
daughter says she doesn’t
understand math, for example,
don’t say that you can’t balance a
checkbook or that all women are

bad at math. Instead, arrange to,

get help for her.

LOW FEE PSYCHOANALYSIS for
ADULTS, ADOLESCENTS AND CHILDREN.
Psychoanalysis entails a commitment to in-depth
psychological exploration with patient and analyst meeting
at a frequency of four or five times a week in order to
change behavior, develop a capacity for new relationships
and achieve a sense of self in deep and abiding ways. The
goals are not only to ease cramped life patterns and
remove symptoms, but also to expand the freedom to work
. and to love.
The lnstitiute is recognized by the American Psychoanalytic
Association as a teaching and training facility.

For information call Susan Chahoy at 661-4224. Evaluation
interviews will be offered by faculty members in their

for his ride. This situation could
be remedied if the entrance for
the handicapped was moved to
the place where the drivers pick
up their passengers.

Karns also found that the
Cathedral of Learning can pose
other problems for the
handicapped. ‘‘It may not seem
like a great deal, but in the winter
when the wind is whistling and

it’s very cold, and you are pushing
your wheelchair, and they don’t
clean sidewalks very well, that
additional 100 yards is a great
deal of distance to endure. It’s not
very enjoyable.”

There is a sign in front of the
Cathedral that states, “N 0 vehicles
beyond this point.” Harris said
that this causes a problem since
he cannot be picked up beside
the building.

Another problem is that the
entrance for the handicapped is
often locked, especially at night.
This presents a problem when
Harris stays late in the building.
There have been times when
Harris has been stuck in the
building and had to find a night
watchman to let him out.

A different problem that arises
for Harris is living arrangements
in Oakland.

“I’ll bet that 95 percent of
rentable places aren’t accessible
to the handicapped,” said Harris,
who is currently on a waiting list
to get an apartment close to
campus.

As Harris sat in front of the
Cathedral of Learning, he
commented on the accessibility
of the Pitt campus. “It’s really not
bad,” he. said.

Spring Break 1990

Contests oﬂer money and glory

By Jennifer Calabrese
Staff Writer

For some spring breakers
running low on cash in Daytona,
contests judging everything from
the best boy to the best miniskirt
can provide upwards of $100 to
the well-endowed winner.

“I won $100 dollars, but I was
blitzed. I needed the money
because I only had $20 to last me
until Friday,” said Vicki Doperak,
Pitt sophomore.

Doperak entered several wet
T —shirt contests in Daytona, with
some less impressive results.

“Last. night I ran out on the
stage after the contest had started.
The guy just kicked me out. At
first I tried to sneak back in but
then I just sat outside and cried,”
she said. - ‘

The day_ after her win she
entered another contest at
Howard Johnson’s and placed
second.

“The problem was that I was
too conﬁdent after winning
yesterday. Placing second just
doesn’t count for anything,”
Doperak said.

Spring
Break
activities
included
belly
ﬂopping,
Wet
t-shirt
and body
contests.

.Howard Gorchov, sophomore,
especially noticed Doperak while
watching the wet T-shirt contests.

“She was just going wild  she
was going crazy up there,” said
Gorchov.

Doperak added that during the
contests she tried to forget about
the people watching.

Not all of the contests were for
women. In one male best body
competition two Pitt students took
first and second place.

“I was feeling really good
because we had finally gotten
here, so I decided to do it on the
spur of the moment. I was doing
all kinds of things up on that
stage,” said John Cord, junior,
who placed second.

Cord didn't do it for the money.

“I wasn’t interested in the
money, I just wanted the glory,’
he said.

Jason Becker, who placed first,
said that his friends talked him

into competing.

“After they convinced me I got
really psyched. I really needed
the money too,” Becker said. “I
won $100 and the next night I
spent $70 throwing a party for

my friends. The rest I kept for
myself.”

Kerry Nelligan, junior, said that
in some instances winning the
contests had nothing to do with
physical attributes.

He said, if the contestant had
a lot of friends in the audience,
he won regardless of whether or
not he was the best looking.

“With the girls it was a little
different,” Nelligan said. “If they
just walked around on the stage
then no one would cheer. It all
had to do with how well they
could shake their thing up there.”

While not everyone competed
in the scores of contests held at
HowardJohnson’s everyday, from
the size of the crowds watching it

seemed that most spring breakers

took in at least one event.

“I wasn’t quite brave enough to
compete but [the contests] were
great. I lost my voice after three
days from all the screaming I was
doing,” Nelligan said.

“Spring break is more than a
trip, it’s an attitude. Peopledc»
crazy things,” said Tom Misuraca,

Pitt Program Council advisor.

Sanctioning South Africa

On Tuesday Nelson Mandela urged foreign govern-
ments to impose stricter economic sanctions and break
diplomatic ties with South.Africa in order to speed up
political changes in the country. .

Mandela was essentially reaffirming the policies of the

. African National Congress by insisting that other coun-

tries would best serve the long-term interests of the South
African nationalist movement if they further isolated
Pretoria from the rest of the world. Mandela said that “The
help that we require is firstly , the intensification of
sanctions, and secondly, the cutting of diplomatic ties
with South Africa.”

Mandela is a courageous man.who suffered nearly 30
years in prison. But one would think that Mandela has not
been so sheltered from the politics of South Africa in the

--past-fewryears to realize that a substantial majority of

South African blacks oppose economic sanctions, as was
proven by a Gallup poll of South African-blacks last
summer.

Economic sanctions hurt South African blacks as much
as they hurt the government. More blacks own cars in
South Africa than do Soviets in the Soviet Union. Given
it may not be a good analogy to compare the Soviet and
South African economies, but the point is that blacks in
South Africa do not want to see their country hurt by
economic sanctions. So why should Mandela insist on
them? . .

Mandela has strong justification for his demand of
sanctions in that he claims that the “pillars of apartheid
are still in place.” He feels that the South African

government must negotiate the political future of the .

country with the African National Congress in order to
tear down those pillars. I
However, some due credit should be given to South
African President ‘-F.W. de Klerk. Granted, a nation’s
president shouldn’t be complimented merely because he
isn’t a racist, but the newly elected de Klerk has already
taken some major and bold steps to ending apartheid,
such as legalizing the ANC and freeing Mandela. There is
reason to be optimistic that more political changes, such
as finally allowing blacks the right to vote, will come.
De Klerk may desire a stable and peaceful transition to

ending apartheid, one that mostly likely will not happen.

overnight. But as long as economic sanctions from
foreign countries continue to cripple the South African
economy, they could cause instability, which may lead to
a non—peaceful transition of power. Mandela must con-
sider these facts before encouraging sanctions

Ridding fears of reuniﬁcation

The philosopher Santayana

once remarked, “Those who do
not remember the past are con-
demned to‘ repeat it.” When
applying that statement to a
reunified Germany, we should
not envision a Fourth Reich or
another Adolf Hitler addressing
sycophantic, Nazi-ﬂag-draped
audiences in Berlin. However,

. we should remember and con-

sider the fact that a nation mis-
guided by a madman or an ag-
gressive Kaiser Wilhelm type can
be prevented from,,such crazy
concepts if we keep our eyes

open and intricately -(but- not

hegemonically) involve our na-
tion in its developments.
The four World War II allies —

the United States, Britain, France

and the Soviet Union —— met
yesterday with East and West
Germany to discuss unification.
On the-surface, a united Ger-
many would be very good for
the United States and the West if
it remains in NATO, or if it be-
comes a member in good stand-
ing of some type of international
alliance which might emerge in
the future, surely one that would
be urged at the behest of the
Soviet Union due to Chancellor
Kohl's decision to include a uni-
fied Germany in NATO. It would
also be an economic superpower:
one that helps international and
Western markets.

But a very powerful, united
Germany will be very unpredict-
able —— as West Germany has

been. A number of noteworthy «

issues must be examined before
allaying any fears of German
unification.

— A little over a year ago,
members of the West German
government sold materials for
the manufacture of chemical
weapons to a chemical-weapons
plant in Libya. Providing such
ominous materials to a country
run by Moammar Kaddafi, a.k.a.
the lunatic of the Middle East, is
not a reassuring or responsible
way for a country of West Ger-
many’s stature to act.

— East Germany’s Prime Minis-
ter, Hans Modrow, is quoted as
warning that there is some basis

to fear a resurgence of national-
ism, racism and anti-Semitism in
East Germany. In a letter to a
rabbi in Los Angeles, ‘Modrow
said that such apprehensions
were “definitely justified.”

-— Eastern European countries

 

P

Kengor  

are concerned that the economic
power of a unified Germany
could economically dominate
and inﬂuence them more than

the Soviet Union did. Czechoslo-

vakia deputy trade minister, Jiri
Nemec, said, “We don’t want to
go from one monoculture to
another monoculture.” Eastern
European leaders favor U.S.
products, investment. and ex-

‘ panded trade to help them limit

the economic inﬂuence of a single
Germany.

— A Germany which remains in
NATO won’t be perceived as an
otherwise armed and neutral
Germany by its neighbors. As
residents of the United States, it
is difficult for us to understand
the histrionics of Europe which
cause fear among the nations of
that continent. As recent as the
20th century, Germany has an
aggressive reputation among its
neighbors. There are still many
European survivors of World War
II alive today. A Germany in-
cluded in NATO would allay
such anxieties; Chancellor Kohl,

after a Camp David meeting with
President Bush, pledged it would.

— The recently legalized Asso-
ciation of Poles Harmed by the

German Third Reich has asked
$284.6 billion in war reparations
from West Germany for the esti-

mated 1.4 million victims that are
still alive. Kohl has rejected the
proposal. V ’
— Despite his previous demand
that such a guarantee only be

linked to Poland’s renunciation '

of war reparations, Kohlbacked
a measure assuring Poland that
its post-WWII border (once held
by Germany) will not be sub-
jected to “territorial claims either

now or in the future” by a unified

Germany. Poland’s President

Jaruzelski claimed that the meas- V

we W§ss.t1’.t.?.f.\a.1.1v..s.2i.tis€%~?s;t 
— Buying political support from
East Germans, Kohl backed a
policy to convert East German
currency to West German marks.
Not only could this policy desta-
bilize European currencies, but it
could spark inﬂation and inter-
est-rate increases in the West.
— A uniﬁed Germany under
Kohl's Christian Democrats will
be much more stable than one
under the other main-party, the
Social Democrats. It’s quite likely
that the Social Democrats might
move Germany from the West-
ern alliance. Kohl is up for re-
election in December. Also, East
Germany will hold elections on

. March 18.

Ironically, the world seems to
have been more stable in the
bipolar world of the Cold War:
the Westvs. the East-Us against
Them. But now the future global
outlook will look much different
as the United States, Japan and
Germany replace the United
States, Britain and Soviet Union
as the world's superpowers.

Currently, there is no reason to
fear a unified Germany. But
unpredictability breeds uncer-
tainty, which leads to instability.
We must continue to cultivate
our relationship with West Ger-
many. However, we must also
have a key role — through trea-
ties and shared economic, cul-
tural and military interests with a
unified Germany — in eliminat-
ing the threats and problems that
come from unpredictability and
uncertainty.

Meal plan diletnma:  Where's the choice in Choice Dollars?

Centuries ago, mankind in-
vented hard currency to replace

his inept and inefficient barter- .

ing economy. Last year, the
Student Government Board
amended this radical concept by
inventing a Choice Dollars meal
plan.

Choice Dollars, as it is com-
monly called, is a declining-bal-
ance meal plan that the SGB
spent a great deal of time trying
to bring into existence last term.
Basically, students are required
to put a certain amount of money
into an account, and the money
is then subtracted whenever they
make a purchase at specified

“restaurants. The plan was im-
plemented to give students more
of a choice in how they spend
their money. If we look at it in
logical terms, however, it has
done no such thing.

One of the problems with the
plan is the cost to implement it.
The different restaurants are
charged a small processing fee
to use the service, but they do
not pay for any of the special-
ized equipment. Last year's SGB

and the Housing and Food Serv-
ice agreed that the cost would be
paid by requiring students in the
residence halls to buy a meal
plan. In the past, only ﬁrst-term
students were required to do so,
but now the mandate is across the
board. If you don’t want a meal
plan, however, you may put a
minimum of $250 into Choice
Dollars. S

Let's look at this hypothetical
situation. Let’s assume that “Mike”
is a student who is living in the
Quad. “Mike” is sick of the food
and service in the cafeteria and
decides he wants to drop his meal
plan. Since he lives in a suite, he
has a stove, a sink and other
various kitchen appliances with
which to cook his own food. _

However, “Mike” discovers that
he must have some sort of meal

plan because the university told_

him so. He looks over the various ’
options and realizes thathis cheap-
est option is Choice Dollars. He
pays his $250 but then realizes
that he can only use them in five
different places on campus.

If he were allowed to put the

money into a bank account, he
could use it in any restaurant in
Pittsburgh, take it out anytime he
wanted with an automated teller
and even gain interest on it. He

 

Jon
Anderson

gets no savings by using his
Choice Dollars, and he has no
way of getting any of his balance
back if he doesnt use it. He can’t
use it at the supermarket either.
What good have the Choice
Dollars done him? None.
Basically, what the university
has done is to tell the residence-

hall students how to spend their
money. Not only can we not
have beer bottles (assuming you
are 21) and visitors after 2 a.m.,
but now we must also budget a
minimum of $250, which we have
to use where they tell us, for our
own food. What choice do I
really have? In reality, less than I
had last year.

I like to believe that I’m enough
of an adult to budget my own
money without having to be told
how to do so by the SGB or the
Housing and Food Service. It's
really an inconvenience when
you consider that in years past,
you could budget any amount
you wanted for your own food
and spend it however and wher-
ever you liked.

Now that we must have a meal
plan, the cafeteria has very effec-
tively ensured, itself of having a
customer. It really doesn’t mat-
ter if the food or the service is
bad. We either eat there, or we
force ourselves to constantly go
to the other places , they have
approved for us. Being a part of
a capitalist system gives us the

Bitter medicine for supporters of supply—side

_ In the dogma of classical free-
market capitalism, it is the free
and unrestricted market that
makes the best choice. Compe-
tition is the great equalizer, and

heretics who argue that this is

not so and who advocate gov-
ernment subsidies to protect
industries,‘ are fpunished with
political death (they are labeled
as liberal Democrats).

Now, free-market capitalists
might have a bitter pill to swal-
low. W. Brian Arthur, econom-
ics professor at Stanford Univer-
sity and author of a recent article
in Scientiﬁc American, argues
that “such an agreeable, picture
often does violence to reality. In
many parts of the economy,
stabilizing forces appear not to
operate.”

Arthur argues that a large
economy can be divided into
two large parts: markets that are
subject to diminishing returns
and those which are subject to

increasing returns. “Diminishing
returns" simply means that the
cost for a company to produce an
item goes up with the number of
items produced. For example,

the cost of mining a mineral goes
up when companies deplete the

cheapest sources and are forced
to iext1z_:ag:t‘..the,n1ineral from more
expensive sources.

a Diminishing returns is the as-
sumption behind classical free-
market capitalism and is the but-
tress behind the dogma that
competition is the great market
equalizer. “An example is the
competition between water and
coal to generate electricity. As
hydroelectric plants take more of
the market, engineers must ex-
ploit more costly dam sites,
thereby increasing the chance that
a coal—fired plant will be cheaper.
As coal plants take more of the
market, they bid up the price of
coal. The two technologies end
up sharing the market in a pre-

dictable proportion,” he says/.,
But Arthur argues that knowl-
edge-based markets, such as
communications and electronics,
are not easily explained in terms
of classical free-market theory.
Increasing returns means that the

cost for a company to produce an
item decreases as the number of
items produced increases." In a
market of increasing returns, the
company that gains an initial edge
usually ends up dominating the
market. An example is the VCR
market.

“The VCR market started out
with two competing formats sell-
ing at about the same price,” he
says. However, “increasing re-

turns on early gains eventually

tilted the competition toward '

VHS." The reason is that in knowl-
edge-based industries, a standard
is important. “Many items, such
as computers or telecommunica-
tions equipment, work in net-
works that require compatibility.
When one brand gains a signifi-
cant market share, people have a
strong incentive to buy more.”
But more subtly, markets
dominated by increasing returns
do not behave in classic ways.
Given two products that start out
at the same price, it is impossible
to predict which one will end up
dominating the market, even if

one of the products is technically

superior. Random events (such
as a rainstorm that delays pro-
duction) may determine the fate
of an entire industry.

Even more important is the
recognition that knowledge-
based markets do not tend to-
ward the best solution. Arthur’s

right to spend our money where
we see ﬁt. I think it would be
wonderful if our American com-
panies could guarantee them-
selves customers in such a man-
ner. It wouldn’t matter how good
our cars were; people would still
have to buy them. It should be
said that over 90 percent of the
residence-hall students still eat in
the cafeteria.

However, there are still many
who don’t want a meal plan and

don’t want to have to give more '

of their money to this university.
These people really have no
options. They either give up their
$250 into a plan they don’t need,
or they continue eating in the
cafeteria for a much greater

amount of money. Since the cost _

of the Choice D ollarsequipment
has already been paid, I sincerely
hope the. SGB and the Housing

and. Food Service can ‘work I

something out to give the stu-
dents a real choice instead of
acting as our big brother.

computer and mathematical
models demonstrate that “a tech-
nology that improves slowly at
first but has enormous long-term
potential could easily be shut
out, locking an economy onto _a
path that is both inferior and
difficult to escape.”

The increasing.returns segment
of the economy has largely(lp,e5:n

ignored, perhaps because knowl- -

edge-based industry has not been

around very long. While Arthur’s .

position that the free market does
not behave in neat, predictable
ways and does not necessarily
choose the best option is hereti-
cal to a strict believer in free-
market capitalism, he has plenty
of historical examples and mathe-
matical equations to back up his
points.

For a ﬁrm believer in strict

Change in school graduation date is okay with me

Pitt has been forced to change
the April 1990 graduation date
from Sunday to Saturday. In doing
so, Pitt has upset many Jewish
students. Although the change
was made a few months ago,
Jewish students are still extremely
upset by the change.

I'm sorry, but I fail to see what
the big deal is.

Saturday is the Sabbath day for
Jews, and it’s against the Jewish
religion forJewish students to do
anything during the Sabbath,
which includes attending gradu-
ation. Well heck, Sunday is the
Sabbath day for Christians, many
of whom attend Pitt. However,
I’ve never heard any Christians
complaining about graduation
being on Sundays in the past.

It seems kind of silly thatjewish
students are so upset about this
graduation-date thing when ev-

ery Saturday is considered the
Sabbath. I mean, thisdate is not a
major Jewish holiday; it’s the
Sabbath. Would God be that upset
if a Jewish student bent the rules
just once for the important reason
of attending commencement?

One Jewish student wrote to
Wesley Posvar and The Pitt News
expressing much disdain, claim-
ing that Pitt is showing a disre-
gard for religious freedom by
changing the date to a Saturday.
This student, along with a few
other students, believes that Pitt is
actually being racist and discrimi-
nating against Jews by making
the date change. “Is it World War
II at the University of Pittsburgh?”
the student who wrote to us
demanded.

Please understand that the date
was changed because of schedul-
ing problems; it is not an inten-

tional attack on Jewish students.
Pitt has too many different relig-
ions and races to be prejudiced

    

Mar  
Staf

against Jews and is overall a
diverse place that openmindedly
accepts the different groups
whose feet tread on Oakland
soil. I’ve only been in Posvar’s

office once, but I swear I didn’t
see any swastikas anywhere.

Pitt has provided an alternative
date which has been set for stu-
dents whose religions are too
strict and prohibit them from
attending one of the most impor-
tant days in a student’s life. I'm
sure that the University of Pitts-
burgh is doing their best to satisfy
everyone with the circumstances
at hand. v

Still, a few hundred extremely
religious Jews and assorted oth-
ers refuse to accept the efforts of
Pitt and continue to act as though
Pitt is intentionally oppressing
the religious needs of the Jewish
community.

This is silly, especially if you
think about it this way: if the
graduation date was changed to
the day of my 21st birthday, and
I was planning on bar-hopping

and getting completely liquored
up, wouldn’t I seem kind of silly
protesting against the university
and saying that Pitt refused to
recognize my ceremonial needs?
Hey, it’s my right to get bombed
on the day of my birthday.

Wouldn't I seem really silly if I
gathered with a couple hundred
other students whose birthdays
fell on the day of commence-
ment and protested, saying that
Pitt was prejudiced against us by
not recognizing our rights?

If my Uncle Eugene’s heart
exploded on Christmas Eve, and

my family had to miss Christmas _

to attend his funeral, should I
assume that Uncle Eugene is a
fascist who is oppressing my
religion’s right to celebrate the
birth of Christ?

Gymnasts post season-high in final meet

By Sharon Kerestes
Staff Writer

The men’s gymnastics team scored a season-
high 261.85 points, defeating William and
Mary (250.75) at home last Friday in its final
regular season meet to finish up with a 5-6
record.

The win was a long-time coming ever since
Pitt lost to William and Mary by three and a
half points back in January and again on
March 3 by less than two points at the Great
Lakes Invitational at Radford University.

“I had a hard time believing they were
better than us,” Coach Frank D’Amico said. “I
watched them compete,’ and even in warm-
ups I kept saying ‘How did this team beat us?’
They just didn’t look good.”

D’Amico said Pitt lost the previous two

times because of its own mistakes.

At the Great Lakes, a key injury in the ﬁrst
event and some vault trouble later put them
in third place behind William and Mary and
Kent State. Radford finished fourth.

Senior Pat Pollaci injured his ankle in his
first tumbling pass in the floor exercise and
was unable to finish the meet. D’Amico said
losing his best gymnast didn’t cost them the
win, but it probably put them out of the
running for second place.

“Even before the injury, it didn’t look like
things were going well,’ he said.

In contrast, everything same together during
Friday’s meet. 1 '

D’Amico knew William and Mary was
strong on ﬂoor, so he worked his team
especially hard in that event during practice
last week.

College three-point line too cl

By Mike Rampa
Asst. Sports Editor

One of the most exciting times
of the year is ﬁnally upon us;

‘ perhaps the most exciting time

for many sports fans. The NCAA
Tournament begins tonight,
marking the beginning of every
team’s dream of success for the
next two weeks on the road to

the Final Four on March 31, in

Denver, Colo.

College basketball has been
the beneﬁciary of many things in
the past. Lucrative television
contracts, overwhelming fan
support and V intense media
attention, to name a few.

However, the game itself has
possibly beneﬁted the most from
one certain rule change, ’ an
adjustment which has made the
game more exciting and has given
the phrase “perimeter game” a
new meaning. " ,

The collegiate three-point line
has given teams the opportunities
to create blowouts, stay in games
down to the wire and to develop
exceptional outside—shooting
talents.

The 19-foot—9—inch distance that
college basketball paints on the
floor to mark the distance of the
three-point line is ‘paralleled by

only one other. level of

competition. And that level is a
lesser degree: high school.
The international three-point

distance is 21 feet, while the

professional line is 23 feet away

‘ challenging. They were also asked

national team this «past summer,

from the hoop.

In the following interviews, the
players were asked if a 21-foot
three-point line at the collegiate
level would be a good idea and
would make the game more

if a progression from 19 feet 9
inches high school‘ to 21 feet
(international distance) in college
to the standard 25 feet in the pros
would be a logical and necessary
step. ‘

All of the following players
have competed on the , U.S.

in Colorado Springs,,,_‘Colo. They
also represented the United States ‘
in the World Qualiﬁcation
Tournament held in Mexico City
late last summer:

Every one of the following
players has shot the three—pointer
numerous times from 21 feet in
their international experience on
the U.S._ national team.

According to a few of the
nation’s premier players, the
current distance for the three— .~
point line in college basketball
may be a little too close for
comfort. 1

However, ' all the players
interviewed agree on one crucial
point.

' A logical progression from 19
feet 9 inches in high school to 21
feet in college to 23 feet in the
pros would be a good idea and
they could certainly understand
such a rule change.

See Line, page 13

“I suspected that we would be losing by a
point or a point and a half, but we only lost
floor by two-tenths,” he said. “They didn’t
have as good a night on ﬂoor. That was a big
landslide.” ,-

Pitt outscored William and Mary in th
next two events, pommel horse and rings,
and was four points ahead going into the
vault.

“Even with a four—point lead, I was
screaming at the guys,” D’Amico said. “I
didn’t want a repeat of the last meet. As it
turned out, everyone landed on their feet. ‘
We didn’t get any great scores, but we didn’t
lose anything. That was the key.”

The momentum continued, as Pitt ﬁnished
the meet with two of its best events, parallel
bars and high bar.

_ r , . Jason Hillman/The Pitt News
. Pitt was very successful shooting the three-pointer, but would
they have been as effective if the line was moved back?

Accolades

‘Boris Becker, Andre Agassi, Stefan
Edberg, Emilio Sanchez. Yes, I saw some
“of the best players in the world compete
last Friday in the quarterﬁnals of the
Newsweek Champions Cup in Indian
Wells, Calif. ‘

0 My, you look different—-— It was the
first professional tennis tournament I had
ever been to, and the first thing I noticed
was how different the players looked in
person as compared to television.

For instance, on the tube Becker looks
stocky and of average height. In reality,
this guy is about 6-feet—4-inches tall and
thin as a rail.

Agassi’s ﬂuorescent Nike apparel hurt
my eyes more in person than on television.
Nike must be having a ﬁeld day with this

guy. He worelbright pink Spandex shorts
under a black, yes black, pair of tennis
shorts. His shirt was made to match, as he
sported a white one with black and
ﬂuorescent pink stripes. No wonder

Wimbledon is barring this kid from
competition on the basis of dress code.

0 Excuse me, is this seat taken? —
Anyway, the first match I saw was Edberg
vs. john Gunnarson. Gunnarson was toast
from the opening serve. Edberg simply
beat him on strategy alone. He had
Gunnarson running back and forth on the
baseline and struggling to reach his shots
on almost every point.

, As a result of his weak shots, Gunnarson
resorted to lobbing the ball on several
occasions during the best-of- three set
match. In the ﬁfth game of the second set,
Gunnarson lofted a ball which was
obviously easy pickins for Edberg.
Gunnarson ran to the edge of the court,
picked up an empty .'foldi’ng,,ch_aifr_and

and observations from the world of tennis

made jungle noises while holding the
chair in front of him in an attempt to block
Edberg’s ensuing overhead smash.

The move was a big hit, as everyone in
the stands, the umpire, Edberg and the
line judges , all took ‘a few minutes to
compose themselves after laughing so
hard. At least Gunnarson «knew that he
was getting stomped like a narc at a biker
rally in this match and decided to resort to
some humorous tactics instead of getting
frustrated and acting like an idiot, like a lot
of these players tend to do. Edberg cruised
to an easy two—set, hour—long victory.

round 5‘ of golf two days before the
quarterﬁnal matches, I knocked my ball to

Panthers send two to NCAA championships 

By Geoff Moskowitz
Staff Writer

Pitt wrestlers Bobby Simpson and Alan Utter
qualified for the NCAA Championships this past
weekend at the Eastern Wrestling League
Championships, held in Bloomsburg, Pa.

“Simpson did an exceptional job,” said Coach
Rande Stottlemyer. Simpson (118 pounds) beat
sixth— ranked Lew Rosselli of Edinboro in order to
advance and face Penn State’s Jeff Prescott in the
finals. Prescott won 10-6, cancelling any hope of a
Panther finishing in the top spot.

“I was very pleased with my second—p1ace finish,”
said Simpson, who finished the season 28-13. “The
way I’ve been wrestling, I have a chance of
finishing in the top eight and becoming an All-
American at the NCAAs.”

Utter (142) finished fourth at the EWL and 53—1 1-
1 overall. Simpson and Utter will leave next
Wednesday for the NCAAs, which will be held at
the University of Maryland from March 22 through
24.

THE PITI‘ NEWS, Thursday, March 15, 1990

The Panthers ﬁnished sixth in the EWL, in front 
of Edinboro and Cleveland State. Both teams beat
Pitt during the regular season. Penn State finished
first, followed by West Virginia, Bloomsburg, Lock
Haven and Clarion.

“I thought our effort was good at the EWL,” said
Stottlemyer, “but we could have just as easily,
qualiﬁed three more for the NCAA Championships. ” I

A fourth—place finish was necessary to qualify for
the NCAAs. Doug Johnson (1 50), Joe Hilferty (177) ,
and Mike Toplisek (158) all finished fifth. 

“We didn’t have the horsepower we needed, but :
the experience will help for next season,” said A
Stottlemyer. “The rest of the pack wasn’t that far
ahead of us.”

Pitt finished their season 3-12 overall, 0-7 in the
EWL.

-Former University of Pittsburgh All—American
Jeff Jelic was inducted into the EWL Hall of Fame 
at the tournament. Jelic is a three-time EWL

I the left side of the fairway on the

17th hole. What luck, because I
could see a match in progress on
one of the outside courts. Okay,
so I was sneaking a view from the
cheap seats. I ﬁgured that a lot of
great players compete on courts
other than the center court; at
least that's what Bud Collins says

.during the first few days of

Wimbledon.

The first thing I noticed is that
there were about three, yes three,
spectators watching this match.
Not a good sign already. Worse
yet, these guys had no ball boys

I and had to retrieve each ball after

a point. I don’t know if you're
going to believe this because I
didn't the first time I saw it. But
there was one line judge on each
side of the court who was
responsible for calling the ball
out anywhere on the court. Now,
professional tennis has enough
trouble with accurate calls from
the six line judges they use in
headline matches, so who knows
what kind of heinous calls these
guys were subjected to.

But this gets better. One of the
line judges was slouched in the
corner, head against the fence,
legs stretched out in an oh-so-
casual manner. And when a serve

Chris Corchiani, North Carolina
State’s outstanding point guard,
believes college hoops would
become more difficult if the three-
point line were moved to the
international distance.

“I think it would add a little bit
more to the game and make it a
little bit tougher,” Corchiani said.

“I think certainly a number of

games are being decided by the
three-point line, but I think it

adds a lot of excitement. With the"

shot clock and the three-point
line in college basketball, you’re
never out of the game.

“But players are taking that
shot often; it’s like part of their
offense now,” he added.

On the distance succession from
high school to college to the

pros, Corchiani was in full’

agreement.
“Yeah, I guess that would be

, logical. The higher level you go,

the tougher the shot is to get off.”
The big man from the Duke
Blue Devils, Christian Laettner,

had an eye-opening experience
while playing at the international
distance. Laettner has been
known to take his share of three-
pointers for a person who, by
size alone (6 feet 11 inches), is an
exception to the stereotypical
three-point shooter.

“I understand [the 21-foot three-
point line] a little more because
19 feet seems awful close. I’m not
saying which one I’d rather have;
I think I'd rather have the closer
one, but it does seem awfully
easy. Especially for people other
than me, because I really don’t
shoot it that well,” Laettner said.

“There are people in the country
who have gotten very proficient
at it: shooting 40 or 45 percent
from out there. It just seems a
little bit too close.

“But it’s a very efficient weapon
at the college level. I’m not for
[the current three-point distance]
or against it. I like it because it
does seem easy, and we can use
it to our benefit, but it’s the same
way for other teams,” Laettner

said.

If the line were moved outward,
Duke may have one less long-
range threat.

“I might mean that I wouldn’t
shoot it really. If it were a little
deeper, I might decide not to
shoot it. I remember over the
summer, Ishot 10 of them, and I
think I made three of them. So
that’s 30 percent, and that’s okay,
but I would probably shoot it less
often.” I

On the logical progression from
19 feet 9 inches in high school to
21 feet in college to 23 feet in the
pros, Laettner admitted,
“Definitely. I could understand
that.” -

Sports Illustrated ’s Player of the
Year, Oregon State's versatile Gary
Payton, took a hardnosed stance
as to where the line should be.

“Personally, I think it should be
out where the NBA has it, because
we might as well get used to just
one line for everybody. ‘

“The 19 feet 9 inches is
eventually going to become

obsolete because it’s just going to
become too easy,” Payton said

Elliot Perry of Memphis State
was a not-so-staunch advocate of
the current distance.

“No. The line is not too short.
It’s a different shot though,
because of the line. If the line
wasn’t there, players wouldn’t
think about it as much. But with
the line, guys will look down to
see if they are behind it instead of
concentrating on the shot,” Perry
said. _ A

However, Perry changed his
tune a tad when reminded that
young high—school prospects,
mostly from the tender ages of 15

-to 18 years, also shoot from the

distance he takes his treys from.

“That would be a good idea.
It's a natural progression. It
probably wouldn’t make any
difference at the college level.
Players will adjust to whatever
the line is. A 21-foot line is not
that much farther out than what it
is now,” Perry said.

An international three-point

distance in college basketball
could indeed reshape the way-

the game is currently played.

For some teams, the three-point ‘

shot may not remain such a
consistent part of their offense,

thus reducing the number of,

proficient long—distance shooters
and really giving the saying “clutch
shot” a new meaning.

The excitement would still be a

part of the game, but a longer line I

may separate the good shooters
from the great ones. Instead of
having three or four players who

can hit the shot, maybe the

number will be reduced to one or
two. ‘

Judging from the opinions of ‘

four of the nation’s top players,
all of whom have seen a‘ different
type of game in international
competition, moving the line
onward and upward may be
something to consider in the
future I

Mathematically, when dividing
one by the number of computer-
tournament wins (zero), the result
usually comes out to be
somewhere around infinity -—
give or take a half—inﬁnity --
which is exactly what Towson’s
odds are in winning the real
NCAA Tournament: inﬁnity to
one.

So, what does Towson’s coach
tell his players before going into
this thing?

1) Don ’t give up the sbzp; it’s

. been given up for you.

2) Big surprise today, fellas -
jobn Elway is going to stop by the
lockerroom latertogive you a pep
talk. '

3) Hey, cheer up, guys: free
Coleesandbotdogs aﬂertbegame.

4) RememberAl ‘n’Moe.

Of course, the one history major
on the team will likely speak up
and ruin, the atmosphere by

‘saying, “Uh, that’s ‘Remember

the Alamo,’ Coach,” but you get
the idea.

THE SOUTHEAST -—— In this
region lurks the NCAA
tournament committee’s biggest
example of Coppin’ out. No, not

Coppin State. The winner of the —

Mid-Eastern Conference deserves
to get in just like any other
conference winner. However, the
choice of Notre Dame was
nothing but political pressure,
not basketball buoyancy. Still, no
sweat; the Irish will get bounced
in the first round by valiant
Virginia.

Michigan State is the sleeper
top seed of the tourney. The
Spartans open with Popeyejones
and his spinach-can teammates
from Murray State, then should
face an extremely tough challenge
from a ghost from the NCAA’s
past, the Houston Cougars.

Syracuse and Missouri could
also challenge for a berth to the
Final Four, but this region will
surprisingly belong to the best
backcourt in college basketball:
the ﬁrm of Anderson, Scott and

Oliver from Georgia Tech. Why?
Hey, in picking these things, you
don’t need rationale, just nerve
enough to withstand all the
heckling you receive when all
your sure—ﬁre picks get wiped
out before Saturday. Okay, I’ll
give ya the Dick Vitale sure-ﬁre
reason—because they can ﬂat 
out  play.

FIRST ROUND UPSET: UTEP

over Minnesota. WINNER:
Georgia Tech over Syracuse in
Southeast final. .
TI-IE'WEST —— Probably the
tournament’s toughest region,
with UNLV, Alabama, Louisville,
Michigan and Arizona all potential
Final Four teams. Loyola-
Marymount will be everyone’s
sweetheart due to the tragic death

of Hank Gathers, but this team _

isn’t talented enough to suffer
that type of loss and still advance
past a ﬁery New Mexico State
squad in the first round.

But what will advance Louisville
into the national semiﬁnals is the
emergence of college basketball ’s
best true (and most—improved)

center in Felton Spencer. The
Cards’ guards and forwards can
play with anyone in the country,
so Spencer can choose to be the
difference, if he wants to be. An
important aside: Jerome Harmon
needs to get his head out of the
Kentucky horse manure, too, for
this thing to work out.

FIRST ROUND UPSET : Ball
State over Oregon State. WINNER:
Louisville over Arizona in West
final.

THE EAST — The East has the
least amount of quality’ of all the
brackets; after the 1-2 seeds of
Connecticut and Kansas, there
are very few true contenders.
Duke is a long-shot possibility,
but the Blue Devils uninspired
performance in the ACC
Championship game tends to
leave a bad taste.

Indiana-California could be the
best ﬁrst-round game of the
tournament. Look for Robert
Morris to lose by 30 Friday night
against Kansas, but still, a
boisterous round of applause is
deserved bv Coachjarrett Durham

for an excellent job this season.

Connecticut is following in the
footsteps of last year’s Seton Hall
team which advanced to the
national ﬁnals — no awesome
talent but tons of heart and hustle.
The Huskies possess one of the
youngest squads in the
tournament, but the lack of prime-
time experience is what will hurt
them in the end.

FIRST—ROUND UPSETS: BYU
over Clemson, Alabama-
Birmingham over UCLA;
WINNER: Kansas over
Connecticut in East final.

THE MIDWEST— This regions '

belongs to the hottest team in
college basketball, the Oklahoma
Sooners. After a slow start, Billy
Tubb’s squad has become a giant
killer, busting up former No. Is
Kansas and Missouri with relative
ease over the last few weeks.
(The Sooners open up against
Towson State, thus, the inﬁnity-
to-one business.) '

Georgetown could be
considered also, but something
just isn’t right with that team.
Attitude?‘ Style? Talent? These
aren't the same Hoyas of years
gone by for some reason.

A Easy riders: Beer and biking in Daytona

By Jennifer Calabrese
Staff Writer

   

DAYTONA, FLA.— In the midst
of ﬂuorescently clad spring
breakers, scores of bikers dressed
in black swarmed the streets of
Daytona for Bike Week ’90.

“There is nothing like bike
week. It’s a chance for all of us to
get together to talk about what
we know best — bikes,” said
Chris Taylor, from New Orleans.

Those bikes — mostly the
famed Harley Davidsons —— were
found everywhere on the beach
strip.

“This is probably the only place
where you'll see more Harleys
than Hondas. Real bikers know
what’s best; there is nothing like
a Harley. It’s an American-made
product and you can’t get any
better than that,” said Guy
Harrigan, from Atlanta.

Harrigan, who owns a
successful hardware business, has
been riding for more than 16
years.

: “People have a really bad

parade which is termed “the
crowning event” of the week.
Many of those bike lovers were
drawn to Daytona’s convention
center which was packed with
enthusiasts surveying the Harley-
Davidson museum on wheels and
the latest new bike models and
machinery.

“Harley puts on this whole
display just so that they can
promote themselves. Still, it’s a
neat chance to see all the new
bikes and to talk,” said Wayne
Mitchson, who is also from
Atlanta.

Harley apparel was featured at
the convention center, where
some leatherjackets sporting their
trademark eagles’ wings were
priced upwards of $600. Biker
organizations, like the Harley
Women’s group, were also there.
HW publishes a monthly
magazine which was started just
five years ago.

“We started with a borrowed
typewriter and now we have a
distribution of over 85,000. It’s
important for people to know

that women love riding too,” said
Cathy Hall, who works in
promoting the magazine.

Hall, a Chicago housewife, has
been riding since she was 10
years old.

“In the movies bikers are these
really tough men with long
beards. I love riding and I’m
everything a biker shouldn’t be,”
Hall said.

“My 75-year-old grandmother
goes on rides with me because
there is nothing like the wind
blowing in your hair when you’re
on that bike,” she said.

While many of the bikers say
that the public has the wrong
idea about them, hotels and
restaurants up and down the
Daytona strip welcome the bikers
with open arms. Almost all of the
electronic billboards on the streets
have messages encouraging the
bikers’ business.

Pitt students who shared their
week of spring break with the
bikers had mixed feelings about
their presence in Daytona.

“It isn’t that I mind the bikers,

THE prrr NEWS, Thursday, March 15. 1990

Laurie Anderson: A strange angel in Pittsburgh

' By Dmitri Ragano

N o other performance artist has
enjoyed the fame that Laurie
Anderson has. With her spiky

‘hair, baggy suit and smirky,

downtown persona, she’s the
lemale equivalent ofDavid Byrne;
the real worlds link to the avant
garde.

Tonight’s performance at the
Syria Mosque will be different
from other mixed-media
extravaganzas such as her 1986
concert iilm Home of the Brave.
Anderson is going solo for her
current tour, so there won’t be
any dancers, elaborate props or
even a band.

Anderson’s new album Strange
Angels suffered several
unexpected delays. Last June,
Anderson stepped out of a New
York taxicab and plunged into an

open manhole. A month later in '

South America, she had a rare ear
infection which caused her to
lose her hearing and sight for
periods of several seconds. Finally

A the album was released last fall,

coinciding with the New York

debut of her show Empty Places.

StrangeA ngels is more ethereal
and less edgy than her earlier
work. One difference is
Anderson’s voice. Instead of
talking her way through songs
and using mechanical voice
modiﬁers, Anderson says she was
“shamed” into learning how to
sing.

After studying sculpture,
Anderson began fiddling and
telling stories in the late 703.
After four years of work, her
seven-hour opus United States I-
[V was first performed in 1985 at
the Brooklyn Academy of Music.
Anderson offered her quirky
vision of America, touching on
everything from big science to
airplane etiquette to her fringe-
dwelling forefather William S.
Burroughs. Her goal was, and is,
to broaden consciousness, to rattle
our cages.

Strange Angels is Anderson’s
most human album to date. It
proves she isn’t a one—trick
bohemian pony. And one can
expect an exciting, unusual show
tonight.

Kevin Costner's Revene not so sweet

 

" Revenge— a simple name for  _ . t,‘ ‘<-
a simple movie. Kevin Costner ‘
plays Jay Cochran, a blandly
macho, older version of Tom
Cruise’s “character” in director
Tony Scott’s (Beverly Hills Cop 11)
other thinkfest, Top Gun.

We watch him retire (at what

-. —— 52, 35 years old?) and head to
Mexico to stay with his Mexican,
political power- broker pal,
Tiburon (Anthony Quinn) and
his wife, Miryea (Sta/eeouts
Madeleine Stowe) at Tiburon’s
sprawling estate for some R & R.

Gee, what comes next? You
guessed it —— Costner and Miryea
have a torrid affair during which
we see them have sex in a
coatroom, in a moving jeep, in a
lake, in Cochran’s cabin, etc.,
etc., with nylon curtains
aesthetically blowing in each and
every scene like a bad Bon Jovi
video. Then T iburon finds them
(gasp!) together, and bad things
start to happen.

You would think that the movie

_._A would start to get interesting at

this point, but after the first half,
it’s all downhill. After the film’s
initial focus on this bizarre love
triangle, the lone Costner
conveniently meets every
hospitable, armed and willing
gringo that the adobes of the
Mexican wastelands have to offer.
After an involving and
2» engrossing setup, Reuengequickly
degenerates into a chaotic pool
of implausibilities and brainless,
gun-toting- characters with
attitudes and “mysterious” shots
of their boots.
This movie probably could
have even been good cheesecake S
if it .weren’t so predictable and
aimless. Where could such a
§ common story hope to go?
Instead of deciding on some
sort of plot line towards some
meaningful resolution after the
couple is separated, screenwriters
Jim Harrison and Jeffrey Fiskin
fire shots in the dark that hit '
cheap attempts at macho male
bonding and intriguing characters
rather than shooting for some
"'!s logical target -— like a satisfying

NTICE OF EXTENDED REGISTRATIO HOUR.

Because there is normally a high volume of students at the beginning of
the registration period, coupled with the implementation of the new
integrated student information system (ISIS) for Fall Term registration,
beginning March 19 the Registration Ofﬁce (G-1 Thackeray Hall) will
remain open later than normal for two weeks. The hours are as follows:

Week of March 19 Through March 23
8:30am-7 :O0pm
9:00am-4:45pm
Week of March 26 Through March 30
8:30am-7:00pm
9:00am-4:45pm
The Registration Office staff would like to remind you that
registration in the ISIS system will be a new experience for everyone.
If some initial difficulties are encountered,

they will do their best to resolve them as quickly as possible.
Your patience, undersganding and cooperation will be appreciated.

By Dmitri Ragano
Asst. Showcase Editor

Katherine Bigelow’s 1987
vampire film NearDar/e was one
of the more interesting, and
probably the most beautifully
filmed, genre ﬁlms of the past
decade. It also made the director
a very hot commodity in
Hollywood.

Now Bigelow is busy promoting
her latest film Blue Steel with its
star Jamie Lee Curtis. At a New
York college press conference,
Bi gelow stands by while everyone
photographs Curtis. Never mind
that the director is easily as
stunning and statuesque as her
actress. Curtis is the star, so
Bigelow waits patiently as the
cameras click on someone else.

In Blue Steel, Curtis plays a
New York City cop who falls in
love with a serial killer.

“My idea was to put a woman
at the center of a picture where
you would traditionally put a
man,” Bigelow says, “to create a
kind of Everyman who everyone
can relate to.”

Putting a feminist spin on the
standard cop ﬂick does make
Blue Steel something of an
anomaly. But what’s really
amazing is the ﬁlm's look. Even
in an age when ﬁ1m—schoo1whiz
kids turned shoot—em-up hacks
are a dime a dozen, Bigelow’s
visual skill is uncanny. In Blue

Steel and Near Dark, she treats
action cliches like a form of higher
art, ﬁlling her gunﬁghts and
getaways with lush, erotic images
and balletic movement.

Bigelow isn’t afraid to admit
her penchant for action: ‘l
respond to movies that get in
your face, that have a real edge
and get your adrenaline going. I
think violence in a cinematic
context can be very seductive.”

A little too seductive, some say.
When asked if violent ﬁlms can
have a dangerous effect on
people, Bigelow defends herself:
“There are case in points where it
could be proven [that a ﬁlm
affected a violent person] but that
is the exception to the rule. A
disturbed individual would be
sensitive to anything, even the
news.”

Originally a painter, Bigelow
studied at the Columbia University
film school, where she made an
8-minute film which featured two
men beating each other to a pulp.
Her first feature, Tlye Loveless
(1980), was a leather biker ﬁlm
starring an unknown Willem
Dafoe. Bigelow’s breakthrough
didn’t come until NearDarle. The
story of a Manson-like gang of
vampires roaming the Southwest
was barely shown in theaters, but
became a cult hit on video.

With Blue Steel, ‘Bigelow joins
Susan Seidelman and Amy
Heckerling as one of the few
women directors working within
the Hollywood establishment.

~She’s certainly the only one

making cop ﬁlms.

“I see nothing culturally or
biologically that would inhibit a
woman from making a tough
film, just as I see nothing that
would inhibit a man from making

it’s just that their bikes are much
too loud,” said Gregg Gnipp,
senior.

Tom Misuraca, Pitt Program
Council Advisor, said that most
of the bikers that he has
encountered have been Very
friendly. p

“With the bikers you are always
going to have some problems but
I haven’t heard one complaint
from students about them,” he
said.

“I met a couple of them last
year and one was an architect
and the other was an assistant
vice president in a large
corporation. Not all of them are
as they seem. Bikers are people
too."

Bigelow. When asked why there
are so few female directors,
Bigelow replies: “There’s not the
awareness that it’s possible.”
With Blue Steel opening
nationally this Friday, Bigelow
moves on to her next project: an

William Gibson's short story “New
Rose Hotel." As one might
suspect, there will be plenty of
action.

“Violence is cathartic; it can be
used as a social tool  I think it’s

and live out that aspect of your
ima ination ”
