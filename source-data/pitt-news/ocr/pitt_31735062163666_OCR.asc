Enrollment Figures
Released for Winter

By PAT POLLINO A .

Should statistical inferences hold true, this year’s oﬂicial winter

term enrollment will surpass last year’s, but will show a decrease
from fall term enrollment.

_In releasing. registration ﬁgures compiled to date, Richard C.

Hodges, director of Student Records, noted that total registration

should reach more than 13,500 for the term, ‘which would be an in-' 

crease of about 500 students over last winter’s term ﬁgure, 13,068.

“The increase can ‘probably be explained by the addition of ‘

three new regionals,” said Hodges.
Rgionals Not Complete

He added that invoice data from Bradford and Greensburg re-
gionals is incomplete and_that evening classes at Johnstown College
are yet to be accounted for. The missing data will have an effect on
ﬁnal tabulations, according to Hodges. ,

Invoices have been received from 13,483 students, and those
paid total 10,980. ' ’

“Data for the big undergraduate ‘schools on the Oakland Campus
is complete,” said Hodges.‘ Liberal Arts is a front-runner in under-
graduate enrollment with 2,660, while Engineering totals show 1,227
invoices received. ' S V ’

A total of 4,681 students have enrolled in graduate programs.
The General Studies program includes 2,112 students. ‘

Hodges explained that registration ﬁgures are compiled once
a week and that they include both full-time and part-time, stu-
dents. He pointed out that a probable 10 per cent decrease is '
expected in comparison with fall term enrollment. . -

“It used- to be traditional under the semester system that winter 
enrollment would decrease from six to seven per cent,” said Hodges.

“However, such a decrease can be expected and hold true nationally.”
Of the 13,483 students recorded thus far, regionals claim 817.

Those attending Johnstown College number" 588, Greensburg, 163, and «

Titusville, 66: No word has been received from Bradford.

most students are immune to the
disease, having already had Ger-

The only real problem posed

by German measles concerns
itself -with pregnant women.
Should a woman develop the

months of pregnancy, her child

The Student ‘Health Service

Tech Students Help  

Oakcorp ’ Draw Plans

By BILL NIEDERBERGER.

Architectural students at

Carnegie Institute of Tech-

nology are getting valuable practice‘ —- andlofﬁcial credit,

Atoo—-through the cooperation of the Oakland Corporation.

, The architectural department at Tech asked Oakcorp
for the speciﬁcations and design problems of the Panther

, Hollow project‘ so that its stude

nts could work on those plans

with in plans for the ravine.

The result has been “very in-
teresting”, according ‘to Frank
Nowak, general manager of Oak-
corp.‘ “They mostly left out the
economic‘ aspect of the design.
There’ is a remote possibility that
some ‘of their ideas will be used,”

High Efﬁciency
-The buildings in the Hollow
‘complex are rated at 75 to 80%

designed so the Tech students
to match in their concept of the
area. '

Efficiency is a term used by
builders and architects to de-
note a relationship between
rent-able space (net) and the
total space gross available in a
building. The percentage of net
to gross determines the efficien-
cy. ,

Troy West, an instructor in the
Architectural Department at Tech,
was the man responsible for ask-
ing the cooperation of Oakcorp._
Wast called the project “strictly

problem in architecture.” Instead
of a senior year thesis, the fac-
ulty gave them this project to
work on. ‘

011 Morality

Life without marriage and chil-
dren is often very lonely, yet un-
faithfulness, divorce, and prema-
ture marriage can lead to a great
deal of unhappiness, observed Dr.
John Copeland, associate profes-
in a lecture
sponsored by Hawthorne House

sor of philosophy,

of Tower A.

Since a high degree of disci-
pline and se1f—sacriﬁce is neces-
sary for a happy marriage; these
traits should be present before

marriage, he suggested.

Copeland warned of the danger
of before—marriage sex relations,
contending that premature maf-
riages on account of pregnancy
are a threat to what the couple
will really want out of life, for it
decreases the chances of getting
enough education and increases
tensions and the chances for, hav-
or having
children who will have a broken

He also stressed how much
everyone who is involved in di-
vorce is hurt, and indicated that
the wife of an unfaithful husband
suffers -more than men realize.
Unfaithfulness is also damaging to
the marriage as a whole, he added,
and can have an adverse effect 0

"responsible and possess suiﬁcient intelligence to rule themselves. What
a joke this idea is when applied to this institution.

In a fascinating science ﬁction" story, a space ship from earth
reaches the outer limits of our solar system only to be turned back by a
heavily armed ship from anothersystem. The reason given by the alien
creatures for their refusal to permit them to continue is that the earth-
N lings have not yet reached a sufﬁcient level of intelligence to mix with

the superior_beings elsewhere in the universe. They are afraid that the

. earthlings Will contaminate them with their base morals and ideals.
This is roughly equivalent with the attitude taken by the administra-
tion of this university toward the student body. The members of the ‘ad-

“T ministration work down to the students and not with them. The reasons
are "quite clear. It is felt that the students, like the earthlings in the

science ﬁction story, are not sufficiently advanced to merit their inclusion
in the meetings of the higher creatures. But if any student thinks for a
. minute that he deserves better treatment, then he has another thought

coming. The student body at this University has demonstrated time and,
" ‘ again that it deserves no better treatment than it is receiving.

Before any responsible group admits a new member into the fold

institution. It must ﬁrst prove that it is responsible and worthy of rec-
ognition, and only then will more attention be paid to the students’
claim for a say in the workings of the University.

But how can any ‘administrator look at this student body and

A _recognize intelligence and a sense of responsibility under all the grime.

The Pitt News and the Student Government are constantly at each other’s
throats; the independents are either jealous of or hate the Greeks; the
Greeks ﬁght one another; the English Majors think the Engineers are
idiots and vice-versa; the common non-active student thinks the organiza-
tions are out to gain power at his expense; the girls distrust any other
girl who associates with the 12th floor; etc.

Some people look to many of these things as a display of good
clean student competition, but it is competition without any general

_ student objective. In many cases it certainly does aid "individual develop-

ment, but there is such a thing as unity, there is something above and
beyond the individual. Yet any individual who works for unity and a
strong student front is viewed with distrust bylmost students. To the

. majority he is just another power seeker. He is trying to unite the stu-

dents so that he can run them himself. ,

Until this distrust ceases, until the petty differences are resolved,
until the students realize that they can have power, until the organiza-
tions band ‘together, until allthese things come about the student will
remain unworthy. . ' . . .
' Would the Delta Sigs admit a sewer cleaner to membership, or the
Engineering and Mines Cabinet a dope addict? The students will never be

Editor, The Pitt Neips:

Mr. James (“Nor a‘ Choice”)
Grossman has become the latest
columnist-wariorr to rush precipi-
tously from the Liberal teepee in_
pursuit of the scalp of Senator
Barry 1 Goldwater. His effort at
tomahawk—weilding is so .crude,
however, that he fails to bring a
single hair back to his wigwam.

Mr. Grossman asserts that Sen-
ator Goldwater “isn’t knowledge-
able enough to cope with the pro-
blems of running the .United
States.” Really, now! Does ‘Mr.
Grossman, juvenile journalist, pre-

sume to posess sufﬁcient wisdom‘

to be able to pontiﬁcate upon the
“knowledge” of Barry Goldwater,
two-term U.S. Senator?

Unfortunately, he does, and
later in his column we see ‘why. It
seemsthat Senator Goldwater has
commited the unpardonable sin
of disagreeing with Mr. Gross-
m_an’s,;views on the simplicity, or
complexity if» current world -

g It has not apparently occurred
to Mr. Grossman that Senator

Goldwater just might have a little --
more “knowledge” thanvhe does; I
‘that the Senator just might be .
right when he says that alterna-I '

tive to’ victory is indeed defeat,

and that it is time for the Liberal A

ostrich‘ to remove its head from

the sands ‘of complexity and to .
face this harsh reality in all its-

brutal “simplicity.” .  ~

It is time for Mr. Grossman and
his Liberal. kin to face the fact
that "the intellects of Senator Gold-
water and his backers are not
nearly sobarren as their own. It
is long past time for Mr. Gross-
man himself to forsake the literary
Warpath and return to the reserva-

‘tion of V reason.

least not without help. Who, and
where, is the invisible scribe? No

iod has been found, or even hint-
ed at. If Oswald was employed
by the FBI to operate in “Castro
groups,” as the new report sug-
gests, it is also reasonable to sup-
pose that in the letters to FPCC
his pen was guided by the FBI.

It is no simple matter any long-

a passport from his government.
If.he is a known Communist or—
subversive, it is almost impossible.
Let a man be known as a do-
gooder, bleeding heart or a non-
conforming screwball, and his ap-
plication for travel will be greeted
with jaundiced’ eye and dragging
feet. But Lee Oswald got one
readily as late as June, 1963.

One day last June, he applied
for a passport and — despite his
record —— got it in a single day.
He called himself. a “photogra-
pher”; he said he‘ planned to‘take
a long trip abroad —' perhaps in-

(Newsweek, 12/9/63.) _

By that date‘, _ Oswald was
known as a Soviet" defector,- had
praised Castro on a radio pro-
gram, and on November 2, 1959,
had written an alﬁdavit saying,
“I affrim that my allegiance is _to
the Soviet Socialist Republic.”
But his passport application was
granted — and posthaste! “It still
isn’t clear how it was processed
so rapidly,” commented the New
York Herald Tribune. , '

‘Oswald’s apartment, too, was
ﬁlled with fascinating‘ things. Be-
sides the batches of leaflets with
the "legend “Hands off Cuba!” and
bearing the unauthorized imprint
of the Fair Play for Cuba Com-
mittee, police found several metal
ﬁle boxes ﬁlled with the names
of Castro ‘sympathizers: How ‘did
he manage, in so short a time,
to compile so extensive a list?

‘ The FBI appearsioncei more in
Oswald’s news life during the last

cluding Russia —- late this year. ,

two_days' before he was killed.

One report details two telephone
calls made by FBI agents to the
Dallas Police on November 24,
warning them of threats against
Oswald’s life. The threats mater-
ialized later the same day under
circumstances whic_h raised a

forest of questions throughout the —

world . . .

The following item completes,
for the moment . . . the weird
Dallas story.

Washington, Dec. 9 —— The
Federal Bureau of Investigation
gave the secret service a “risk”
list of'_Dallas individuals in ad-
vance of President Kennedy’s
fatal trip. But the list did not»
include the name of Lee H.
Oswald.

An official source explained
‘today that Oswald’s name, like
many others in the Dallas ﬁle,
had been ommitted because the
FBI found nothing in Oswald’s
background to mark him as a
potential assassin . . .

‘Oswald was’ not under sur-
veilance by the FBI at the time
of President Kennedy’s visit to
Dallas»Nov. 21, the FBI noted.
Months of checking by the FBI

had indicated that Oswaldwas
neither‘ a spy nor. a saboteur.

That,‘it was said,-covered the
statutory area of FBI respon-
sibility. (The New York Times,

12/10/63.) ‘ , _

Lee Oswald, the twice-c0urt-
martialed Marine who defected
to Russia and renounced his
American citizenship, the pro-
Cuba activist who, had been ar-
rested a few months_earlier while

distributing leaflets, this erratic '

“Marxist” who was employed ‘on
the route of the President’s mo-

torcade — Lee Oswald did not
qualify for the FBI’s exclusive
security “risk” list. And why?

Because the FBI’s “statutory re-
sponsibility” was limited to sus-
pected spies and saboteurs!

This "sudden legalistic attach-
ment to its self-interpreted
“statutory” obligations must cause

Benjamin Franklin (or The Louisville Slugger, as he’ is better A

known as) said, “‘A' penny saved is a penny earned,” and we,

the college population of America, have taken to heart this sage ' '

advice. We spend prudently; we budget diligently. Yet, despite
our wise precautions, we are always running short. Why? Be- .
cause there is one item of expense that we consistently under-
est.ima.te—the cost of travelling home for weekends.

Let us take the typical case of Basil Metabolism, a sophomore
at UCLA majoring in avocados. Basil, a resident of Bangor,

. Maine, loved to go home each weekend to play with his faithful

dog, Spot. What joy, what wreathed smiles, when’Basil and
Spot were 1"e—unitedl Basil would. leap into his dogcart, and
Spot, a genuine Alaskan husky, would pull Basil all over Bangor,
Maine—-Basil calling cheery halloos to the townfolk, Spot
wagging his curly tail. 3

 

~J‘&(:~'.""-" .. :7‘ -_; --n -w-.....-—...-

But the ‘cost, alas, of travelling from UCLA to Bangor, Maine,
ran to $400 a week, and Basil’s father, ‘alas, earned only a
meagre salary as a mete_r—reader for the Bangor water depart-
ment. So, alas, after six months Basil’s father told Basil he ‘
could raise no more money; he had already sold everything he
owned, including the ﬂashlight he used to read meters.

Basil returned to California to ponder his dilemma. One
solution occurred to him-—to ship Spot to UCLA and keep him

~ in his room—‘but Basil had to abandon the notion because of
.his roommate, G. Fred Sigafoos, who was, alas, allergic to d_og

hair.
Then another idea came to Basil-a stroke of genius, you

. might call it. -He would buy a Mexican hairless chihuahua! '

Thus he would have adog to pull him around, and G. Fredis

- allergy "would be undisturbed.

The results, alas, were not all Basil had hoped. The chihua-
hua, alas, was unable to pull Basil in the dogcart, no matter
how energetically he beat the animal.

Defeated again, Basil sat down withcG. Fred, his roommate,

I . to smoke a. Marlboro Cigarette and seek a new answer to the

problem. Together they smoked and thought and—Eureka!—
an answer quickly appeared. (I do not suggest, mark you, that
Marlboro Cigarettes are an aid -to cerebration. All I say about
Marlboros is that they taste good and are made of ﬁne tobaccos‘
and pure white ﬁlters -and come in soft pack or Flip Top box.)
_ Well, sir, Basil and G. Fred got a great idea. Actually, the
idea was G. Fred’s, who happened to be majoring in genetics.
Why not, said G. Fred, cross-breed the chihuahua with a Great
Daub and thus produce an animal sturdy enough to pull a dog-
car . ' . ,

It was, alas, another plan doomed to failure. The c1'oss—breed-

A ing was done, but the result (this is very difﬁcult to explain) was

a raccoon.

‘ But there is, I a.m pleasedto report, a happy ending to this
heart-rending tale. It seems that Basil’s mother (this is also very
difﬁcult to explain) is a glamorous blond aged 19 years. One
day she was spotted by a talent scout in Bangor, Maine, and
was signed to 9. fabulous-movie contract, and the entire family
moved to California and bought Bel Air, and today one of the
most endearing sights to be seen on the entire_Paciﬁc Coast is
Spot pulling Basildown Sunset Boulevard——Basi1 cheering and
Spot wagging. Bas1l’s mother is also happy, making glamorous
movies all day long, and Basil's father is likewise content, sit-
ting at home and reading the water meter.

ROB LEVINE rests of pool side offer winning Saturday night

Panther Swimmers

Beaten by Maryland

By GUY BUCCI

A standing room only crowd at Trees Hall pool, including
Chancellor Litchﬁeld, watched the Maryland swimming team
down the Panthers, 54-41, Saturday.

Maryland had more depth than the Panthers could cope with.
While the Panthers took six of the eleven ﬁrst places, they were
not able to back them up with enough second places to add to
the point total.

The top individual star of the meet was co-captain Rob
Levine. Levine broke two records in a vain attempt to keep

-. his team in ‘contention with the Terps.

In a surprising move,» Grady used Rob in the 200-yard back
stroke and then again in the next event, the gruelling 500-yard
freestyle. Levine broke his own records in the back stroke and
in the freestyle. '

In the diving, Maryland’s all-America Ron Squires edged
out a controversial eleven point victory over Panther sophomore
Don Hahnfeldt. Hahnfeldt turned in his best performance, but on
the next to last dive, a split second timing mistake caused him
to have a sloppy entry into the water and thus loose valuable
points. ‘

The Panthers lost the meet in the relay races. The re-
lay races are a test of a team’s "depth, and the Panthers just
didn’t have enough depth. Top individual performances by
Andy James, and the Levines couldn’t overcome a disad-
vantage in team depth. .

In reviewing the meet, coach Ben Grady commented, “I
couldn’t ask for a better performance than that. Rob Levine
broke two records tonight, Ron Levine tied his old mark in the
butterﬂy and broke his record in the 200-yard medley relay. We
lost because we just didn’t have it in the relays.”

Basketball Team Wins Eighth  

Straight; Record Now, 12-1-

Saturday’s 108-75 win over Carnegie
Tech was the second scare of the season
for Panther publicityman, Beano Cook.
Cook was afraid that Pitt would score
two more points and break the Field
House record of l09made against Geneva
in the 1957-58 season. V 

Earlier this year 1
Cook had his ﬁrst
fright as the Panthers
scored 107 against
Dartmouth. ‘If Pitt
had scored 110 on
either occasion, Cook
and his staff would
have had the problem
of changing the rec-
ord book and next
year’s brochure. 

The win over Tech DAVE, SAUER
was the Panthers’ eighth in a row and gave
them a 12-4 mark for the season. The team
would have to win all eight remaining games

    

to better last year's record of 19-5. This is made,

more -difficult because six of the eight games

nine points in a row while Tech only scored
three.

The General had 17 at halftime
up with 31 points to lead everyone.
he had a good night,” said Panther coach Bob
Timmons, “Maybe now he’ll have his conﬁ-
denceback. He was forcing his shots lately and
wasn’t hitting.” '

Dave Sauer had 19 points in the ﬁrst half
and added ﬁve more in the second. Hehit onlll
of’ 17 from the ﬁeld for 65 per cent. In three of
the last four games Sauer had scored 19, 20 and
23 points.

Timmons said, “Tech just doesn’t have the
personel we do. We knew we could fast
break them and make them play our type of
game‘); - -

Tartan coach Mel Cratsley added, “We were
okay offensively, but we didn’t play defense.
I didn’t expect Pitt to' get that many points off
of us. I know they won’t the next time we play
and I guarantee a better game.” That’s like bet-
ting on the Yankees to win the American Lea-

Depth of Track Team Decisive
In Victory Over Slippery Rock

Lack of depth -— a problem which has been a constant
source of trouble for the Panther track team in recent years
-— was all that stood between Slippery Rock and a major
track upset Saturday at the Field House. Depth was on the

side of the Panthers Saturday and°

coach Carl Rees made good_use
of it to beat the Rockets, 53-38.

Slippery Rock led through the
ﬁrst eight events of the day, but
in the ﬁnal three events—the two
mile, the mile-relay and the two-
mile relay—Rees was- able to
throw in fresh runners while
Slippery Rock had to use men
who had run earlier.

The Panthers took the ﬁrst
three places in the two mile and
won both relays. The Rockets
lack of depth was best shown
in the two mile where their
top runner, Fred Lucas, ﬁnished
a distant fourth. Lucas had
earlier scored an impressive
win in the mile with a time
of 4:22.5, but didn’t have any-
thing left for the two mile as
he ﬁnished behind Ralph Ba-
sinski, Steve Waslo and Larry
Robinson .

In the two-mile relay Rees was
able to use three fresh men, Jim
Higgins, Jim Studnicki and Dave
Dawson. They teamed with John

Bailey, who was second in the
mile, to set a Field House record
of 8:12.

The early going wasn't as
successful for the Panthers.
Pitt's only win in the first ﬁve
events was Al~Thomassey’s vic-
tory in the shot put. The Rock-
ets took the high jump, pole
vault, mile and 600-yard run.
Panther Mort Stanﬁeld was sec-
ond in the pole vault and high
jump.

The Panthers came on strong
in the sprints with Joe Friend
and Luddy Hayden taking one-
two in jche 50-yard hurdles and
Bill DelVecchio and Mike Slutsky
doing the same in the 50-yard
dash.

Things really looked bad for
Rees’ team as Slippery Rock’s J im
Waldorf nipped Don Hinchberger
at the ﬁnish of the 1,000 yard run
to give the Rockets a 38-35 lead.
But Panther depth shut out the

visitors in the ﬁnal three events.

are away from home.

Most of the crowd knew who‘ the winner
‘would be but wondered when the Panthers’
would break it open. The 956 fans had to wait
until the ﬁrst half was half over. _With Pitt
leading, 21-1'7, Brian Generalovich scored

Owl Gymnasts
Hand Panthers
Fourth Defeat

With the new scoring rules
in effect this season -it’s not
easy for a gymnastics team to
be badly beaten. For such a
thing to. happen a -squad
must display a combination
of few top performances and very

little depth. That’s exactly what‘
the Panther team showed Satur-

day against Temple. V
When it was all over they, had
been soundly beaten by a score
of 156.05—l28.20. The only event
in which they showed any con-
sistency was the long horse. Here
Ed Stim, Al Leonhard, and Jack
Schwar all performed adequately.
Unfortunately, however, b e t t e 1‘

scores by the Owl’s Charles Elk-'

ler, Bill Wright, and Mark Cohn
negated even that effort.

Coach Warren Neiger was hard
pressed in trying to comment on
the meet. “Due to injuries, we
just don’t have enough boys left,’’
he stated.

Because of the shortage of man
power Neiger was forced to enter
only two men in both the ﬂoor
exercises and the horizontal bar.
This, of course, was tantamount
to giving up at least ten points.
It also indicated a deﬁnite lack of
versitility in his team since no
one was able to switch events
in order to help out.

would see more than his accustomed two
minutes of action. But Timrﬁons held him out
until there were 2:56 remaining saying, “I
wanted to save him until the right psychological
moment. I know the fans were waiting to see
him.”

Michigan Wrestlers Conquer
Panthers, 13-6,. at Ann Arbor

. By FRANK SMIZIK

Besides meeting the _top team in the Big Ten and one of
the best in the country coach~Rex Peery had some other
problems also as Michigan overwhelmed the Panther wrest-
lers, 18-6, at Ann Arbor Saturday.

The Panthers could only manage two victories against
the Wolverines, one by Frank O’Korn at l37—pounds and
one by Lee Hall at 177-pounds.¢
Mike Johnson, who almost always
comes through at 130—poupds,
wasn’t able to compete because of
an upset stomach.

Tom Heniff took over Johnson’s
position and was decisioned by.
Bill Johannensen, 6-3. The loss
was I-Ieniﬂ”s ﬁrst of the'season.

Other_ Panther trouble occur-
red in the 157-pound match
where Tom Baily received a
slight head injury. Baily con-_
tinued in‘ his match with Michi-
gan captain Wayne Miller but
lost, 4-3.

The victory by O’Korn was his
ﬁrst of the season and might have
shown Peery that O’Korn ‘ be-
longs in 137-pound division. He

Killian dropped his match to
Ralph Bahna, 5-1.
Although Dino Boni was de-
feated. in his 147-pound match
Peery thought he did a ﬁne job.
“Boni had him until the ﬁnal
period, but ‘Deitrick (Lee) just
caught .u1i_ in the third period
and took him. Dietrick is a ﬁne
wrestler and _a Wilkes Tourna-
ment champion.” ,
Lee Hall continued to go u_nde—
feated this season in the 177
pound division. His record is now
5-0 as he took Chris Stowell in a
close match, 2-0.
Since there was no,191-pound‘
class Panther Ken Barr moved up
to heavyweight and wrestled Bob

had been wrestling at 147 and 157-
pounds the whole season, but de-
cided to trim down to 137-pounds
where he proved too strong for
Michigan’s Gary Wilcox and de-
cisioned him, 11-9-. » - .
With the placing of O’Korn at
137-pounds, Clair,Riley, a regular
137-pounder, had ‘to tangle with
Rick Bay at the 167-pound weight
level and was decisioned, 5-0.
In the 123 pound division Duff

Staly. Staly took the‘ match ‘by a
3-0 verdict. Barr took the place of
Bill Beck at heavyweight because
he had more experience.

Michigan now holds the distinc-
tion of being the Panthers tough-
est opponent. The Panthers’ all-
time mark- against Michigan’ is
now 6-8-2, which is the poorest
record Pitt has against any op-
ponent. ~
