UPMC includes lab

Shruti Revankar
Staﬁ'Writer

The court battle that has pitted the
city and mayor against their larg-
est nonproﬁt organization recently
increased in intensity. ‘ -

As UPMC gears up to ﬁght a law-
suit the city has ﬁled that alleges that
UPMC doesn’t act as a nonproﬁt, it
has also ﬁled a countersuit against
the city: a suit it amended June 6
to include an organization that has
publicly criticized UPMC’s nonproﬁt
status. C

Mayor Luke Ravenstahl an-
nounced in March that Pittsburgh

Wednesday, June 26, 2013
ALWAYS RAINY IN PITTSCU R  

would challenge UPMC’s tax-exempt
status in court, ﬁling a lawsuit in the
Allegheny County Court of Common
Pleas. Before the suit, the city in-
vestigated tax forms ﬁled by UPMC
and concluded that UPMC does not
qualify for tax exemption.

UPMC countered the city’s ac-
tions April 19, ﬁling a suit in the
United States District Court for the
Western District of Pennsylvania,
alleging that Ravenstahl and the
city unfairly singled UPMC out for
scrutiny. The same day it ﬁled the
countersuit, it also had the city’s
lawsuit transferred to federal court.

On June 6, UPMC amended

Est. 1910

WS

Vol. 104
Issue 9

its complaint against the city and
Ravenstahl, which it ﬁled earlier
this month, adding three other
defendants: Fair Share Pittsburgh,
a project of the Service Employees
International Union’s Healthcare
Pennsylvania and two John Does,
or unidentiﬁed parties it says have
been working for Fair Share. V
The complaint alleges that Ra-

venstahl, the city, Fair Share and the '

John Does all conspired to engage
in an unconstitutional campaign to
compel UPMC to pay taxes that the
hospital didn’t owe and to defame
UPMC.

“There is no lawful purpose for

or group in lawsuit against city

any of the defendants’ [sic] conspira-
torial actions,” the complaint said.
“As for the mayor, he seeks to divert
attention from scandalous public
reports of his precarious legal pre-
dicament and curry favor with par-
ties intent on harming UPMC and
capable of cushioning his political
fall.”

Marissa Doyle, press secre-
tary for the mayor’s ofﬁce, did not
provide comment in regard tothe
speciﬁc accusation that the lawsuit
against UPMC was an attempt to di-

. vert attention away from the scandal

affecting the Pittsburgh Police Department and Ravenstahl’s '

personal security detail.

In the past several months, Fair Share Pittsburgh has been
vocal about its disapproval of UPMC’s actions. The organiza-
tion has publicly voiced its opinion that UPMC doesn’t qualify
for tax exemption. '

The complaint says Fair Share engaged in a mail campaign
to defame UPMC and includes images of the items Fair Share
distributed.

“UPMC is the city’s biggest property owner,” one-pamphlet I

says. “But UPMC doesn’t pay its fair share to keep our city
running.” I ‘

UPMC spokeswoman Susan Manko did not respond to
multiple requests for comment.

Fair Share identiﬁes itself by name on the pamphlet, which
also bears Ravenstahl’s image. The mayor appears on other
pamphlets mentioned in the complaint as well.

“We won’t be bullied by frivolous lawsuits that try to dis-
tract from the fact that Pittsburgh needs more from UPMC,”

_ Neal Bisno, president of SEIU Healthcare Pennsylvania, said

in a press release issuedjune 7, the day after UPMC named the
union in the amended complaint. '

' Doyle denied that Fair Share Pittsburgh is affiliated with the
city, but a press release provided by Doyle from the mayor’s

ofﬁce conﬁrmed that he aligned himselfwith the organization's

Ravenstahl said in a statement his office issued March 20, when

x

it ﬁled its suit against UPMC. ‘

He said that UPMC takes part in questionable practices,
including “turning away patients with insurance it doesn’t
like” and “attempting to silence employees. coming together
to improve their jobs.” '

The suit the city originally ﬁled against UPMC contains
similar allegations that UPMC threatened to turn away patients
who held competitors’ insurance. . .

Pittsburgh City Solicitor Daniel Regan wasn’t available for
additional comment despite multiple attempts.

Bisno also claimed UPMC has an obligation to the people

the HUP Test, a ﬁve—part test that determines organizations’
eligibility for nonproﬁt status under Pennsylvania state law.

In its suit, the city reasoned that UPMC does not pass the ‘

HUP Test. One prong of the test says that the organization
must operate free of a proﬁt motive. ~ ; .
In the city’s complaint against UPMC, the city cited high

pay for top UPMC officials and not investing surplus revenue I

in charitable activities as evidence that UPMC operateswith
a proﬁt motive. _
The suit also claimed that UPMC only donatesbetween 1

The Pittsburgh Council on Higher Education, which in-

‘ cludes Pitt and most other area universities, openly sup-

ported UPMC in the ﬁght against the city. In an open letter

, to Ravenstahl dated April 5, the council, said the mayor’s

lawsuit wouldn’t help the city raise. revenue and would hinder
cooperation between the city and its nonproﬁts.

“Your decision to bring a lawsuit challenging the tax—ex-

Just a little  The fructose
corn syrup ‘ debate continues

Sophia Al Rasheed
Staff Wrz'ter

U.S. citizens have a collective sweet

- tooth, "and they really don’t care

from where they get their sugar.

And, unfortunately, big agricul-
tural companies have capitalized
on thislapathy by relentlessly pro-
moting their form of sweetener.

For example, a recent study
that caught my attention explicitly
states that genetically modiﬁed
corn contains almost no nutri-
tional beneﬁts in comparison to
natural corn and is linked to health
hazards. It’s a disgusting fact and
will hopefully cause us to imple-
ment some much-needed changes
on the agricultural front.

The harmfulness of genetically
modiﬁed foods is as complicated
as the modiﬁcation process it-
self, but the recent discovery re-
lating to corn, a substantial part
of American consumption and
agriculture, gives us the uncom-
plicated fact that we apparently
have incredibly low standards on
the matter. According to Natural-
news.com, genetically modiﬁed
corn goes through the genetic
modiﬁcation process solely for

elﬁciency reasons, which isn’t a
big surprise when considering
U.S. companies’ tendencies.-This
genetically modiﬁed corn lacks
many nutrients found "in natural
corn. and has direct and negative
effects on the body. Ultimately,
it just acts as cheap ﬁller space
- instead of food.

Upon hearing this, I instantly

thought of the potential this had

- on high fructose corn syrup: an
unclear subject that failsto pro-
vide us with answers despite its
frequent appearance in conversa-
tion. I was sure that transferring
this information would allow me
to write an article ﬁnally proclaim-
ing —— once and for all, —— that
high fructose corn syrup should
be avoided.

But, to my disappointment, I
can’t provide the entirety of the
content of that article in the scope
of this one, as the subject remains

. complicated and requires a lot of
digging to attain an actual answer V

on the topic.

My assumption that all high
fructose corn syrup — the in-
expensive.sweetener substituted
for sugar and often abbreviated
as HFCS — is made from geneti-

cally modiﬁed corn isn’t neces-
sarily correct despite the fact that
many sources had ingrained the
idea ingrained in my head.

Essentially, there are two com-
peting sides giving mixed informa-
tion about our sweeteners: those
that advocate for HFCS and hope
to show that our body can’t tell the
difference between this kind of
sugar and natural sugar and those
that advocate for natural sugar.

Advocates of high fructose corn
syrup strive to maintain an inno-
cent reputation for their product
for good reasons. Corn is the No.
1 agricultural product in the U.S.,
and any signiﬁcant ﬁnding regard-
ing use of the crop would result in
a change for corn production and
the economy. Furthermore, HFCS
is signiﬁcantly cheaper to use than
regular sugar, which is the reason
it’s a staple in so many inexpensive
packaged foods.

Based on the information
above — that genetically modiﬁed
corn isn’t what our body should
consume —— you would think that
it’s very clear that we should avoid
HFCS and do our bodies a favor. I

admit, I initially shared this sentiment. But,
as annoying as it is to admit, not all HFCS
necessarily contains traces of genetically
modiﬁed corn, and in certain instances,
our bodies do process HFCS just likelregular
sugar — though not-all, as corn advocates
imply.

Additionally, organic companies, while
appearing to attempt to protect the health
of Americans with their natural approach

to food, aren’t necessarily shielded from’

criticism because they'have good intentions.
Many sources that strive for the natural
approach mistakenly imply thatall HFCS is

thus has a negative effect on the body. But,
as already shown, this is not the case. They,

food to become. But one bottom line I can

motives of their own and are trying to get
you to pick one rather than pay attention to
how much sugar we consume, regardless of
form. Ultimately, that should be the concern
of Americans.

Hopefully the discovery of the harm of
genetically modiﬁed corn will cause us to
take the route of 27 other countries that
have banned genetically modiﬁed foods
altogether. The fact that several countries
have higher standards and, perhaps not—so—
coincidentally, have fewer health problems
than we do speaks for itself. Also, banning
such food would allow us to gain a clear
answer about the food we’re consuming
without forcing us to pay the extra price
required to afford organic productsﬁ _

6119 presented the city with a venue that gained national respect for its blank canvas nature and experimental programming. _Ben Brownlee | Staff Photographer

John Lavanga
Impulse Ediotr

Although he was only in town fora few_days,
Nashville, Tenn., resident Andrew Armstrong
discovered 6119 in the same manner as many
Pittsburghers before him. . ‘

“I was just wandering around Lawrencev—
ille and ran into 720 Records [on Butler
Street], and I was just asking them what I
should do,” Armstrong said. “They said 6119
was the place to be.”

Intrigued, he used a combination of GPS
and his limited knowledge of the city to make
the trek out to Pittsburgh’s most unique, mem—
orable and clandestine venue Monday night.
After seeing a stunning and immersive audio-
visual set from Detroit artist Cooper Holow—
eski, Armstrong left with a strong impression
of the art and the space that held it as well as
a tinge of envy toward the city’s residents.

“Living in Nashville, this is what it lacks
down there. The edginess of places like this.”
he said. ,

Armstrongwill be one of the‘ last to experi-

ence the sonic treasure hunt that discovering ' ‘

6119 has become over its brief yearlong exis-
tence. On Friday, VIA, the group behind 6119,
will team up with Detour to put on one ﬁnal
synthesis of cutting edge visual arts, which
will include a performance from‘ renowned
techno artist Terrence Dixon and visuals from
a number of artists before shutting its doors
for good.

Originally opened injune of last year, 6119
was created to provide a home for VIA, the
group created-by Lauren Goshinski and Quinn
Leonowicz back in 2010. Over the course of
the past three years, VIA has established itself

as a respected presence in underground art

and music circles both locally and nation-
ally. Beginning with a music and new media
festival the year it was founded, VIA had put
on captivating audio—visual performances in
different venues around the city.

When East Liberty Development Inc. gave
the group an opportunity to take over the up-
stairs space in a building running along Penn
Avenue at the current address, 6119, VIA was
able to renovate it and create a location that
would act as a blank canvas, meeting the needs
of each individual performance.

“It takes on the feelings of the people that
are inside the space,” said Goshinski. “When
we put [6119] back together, we wanted it to
be as blank as possible.”

The result of their renovation work was a
space that Goshinski described as a “rough—

‘ neck tree house.” Attendees enter through an

unmarked stairgase behind the aged and par-
tially abandoned building, climbing several
ﬂights of rickety stairs before ﬁnding them-
selves in a dimly lit hallway that eventually

' opens up to a small stage and more standing

room. On their left is a bar, with drink specials
scrawled on the long mirror behind it, and
on their right are a series of small tables. Ex-

posed brick is visible on portions of the wall,
and polish was certainly not a priority in the
renovations. It’s a bare—bones, intimate space
that shatters any sort of divide between artist
and onlooker.

Over the past year, 6119 has hosted dozens

of shows and has been ﬁlled to its 160-person
maximum capacity on a number of occasions.
Goshinski estimates that more than 200 art-
ists have passed through and claims that the
venue’s impact on the Pittsburgh music scene
is undeniable.
_ “It brought a tighter integration of music
and visuals arts,” she said. “Our two primary
focuses were to have great sound and great
visuals, and in this weird kind of tree house,
we delivered that.”

For Raeem Martinez, avolunteer with VIA
for over a year, the importance of the space
was a more practical one: consistency. “VIA
was jumping around to different places before,
but having a home, it gave people one destina-
tion to go to. You knew that every Friday there
was something going on.”

However much the consistent locale
helped VIA, there was always the knowledge
among the group that its tenure was tempo-
rary. The lease was limited, and the ultimate
plan for ELDI was that the building would
eventually be bought for development, so

‘ news that 6119’s building had been purchased

by Alphabet City Co. and was slated for demo-
lition in the near future was met with disap-

pointment, but not surprise.

Goshinski expressed disappointment that
they were unable to extend their stay at 6119,
but also admitted that the venue —— as effective
as it was — was imperfect at best.

“The space, atthe end of the day, isn’t what
we would need long term.” Goshinski said,
adding that the purchase was “going to make
[VIA] take on the bigger plans faster than we
thought.” ‘

Still, the venue provided a trial run of sorts
for VIA, proving that an experimental mixture
of music and video could survive and thrive
in the city.

“Anyone can say ‘Oh, I have crazy basement
shows,’ but to throw open an actual venue and
have people coming reflects the city’s appetite
for a venue like 6119,” Goshinski said.

Terrence Dixon, whose recent album,
From The Far Future Pt. 2,- has been well—re-
ceived among the techno community and will
provide a minimalist soundtrack to bring the
venue’s time to a close. Fiercely unique in his
approach and style, Dixon’s live performances
are something of a cherished rarity, and VIA
was able to make the booking because it had
developed such a close connection with the
burgeoning Detroit art and music scenes. As
for the show itself, Goshinski expects 6119
to live up to its reputation for live music one
last time.

“It’s going to be a c1ankety—clank dark and
dirty dance party. We’re gonna get real.”l

Grade: . A

Sounds like: 2 The rapture

Last month, in 66 cities across the world, a
black man’s face was projected onto large build-
ings, drawing enormous crowds of spectators
itchingto record the event on their cell phones.
' “My mama was raised in the era when /
Clean waterwas only served to the fairer skin,”
the man declares, remaining virtually expres-
sionless. .

The man was rapper Kanye West, who was
promoting his single “New Slaves” from his
sixth studio album, Yeezus, and the lyrics and
showmanship were nothing new for one of
contemporary hip-hop’s most revered artists.

This has been the central theme in West’s
music since 2008’s divisive 8085 8: Heartbreak:
tackling what he seeslas injustices through a
shockingly personal loudspeaker.

These injustices don’t have to be racial, and I

while Yeezus rightfully pays special attention to
race issues, it’s a mistake to pigeonhole West’s
qualms with the world in such black and white
terms. ,

and in what must be a perfect metaphorfor guys
who can never seem to get it right, West’s songs
are easily misunderstood.Take the Hudson
Mohawke sampling, “Blood on the Leaves,” in
whichh we ﬁnd West railing on his “second—
string b*tches,” only after making impassioned
pleas such as “we coulda been somebody.”

Yeezus is full of contradictions like these.
The searing sawtooth synths of the album’s
opener,“On Site,” for example, dismiss any as-
sumption that this record will sound like anoth-
er glossy rap album, yet a lush reverb—assisted
choir sample abruptly interrupts them. Kanye
quickly switches gears omthe track, barraging
listeners with noise—heavy arpeggiators that
make lines such-as “black d*ck all in ya spouse
again” hard to ignore. '

Inalot ofways Yee_zus’ most uncomfortable
moments are its most important, and for 41
minutes the record assaults the ears by ﬁnding
ways to push that discomfort to the surface.

The admittedly raunchy “Hold My Liquor”
is perhaps the most accurately complex por-
trayal of the male psyche in existence. Lines as
lascivious as they are tragic make the seemingly
autobiographical track deeply piercing. West
is, without repentance, walking us through a
night that is at once relatable and repulsive,
drunkenly and desperately driving to an ex-

lover’s house, thinking,“One more f*ck, and V

I can own ya.” -

Justin Vernon and Chief Keef narrate West’s
equally complex and seemingly disparate sub-
conscious for a dark journey that connects
beautifully on a human level, even if that level
is awindow into the unfailing darkness ofbeing.

There are plenty of demons for listeners
to sort out on this record. My Beautiful Dark
Twisted Fantasy delved into the depths ofWest’s
pain, but a public image wrongfully ruined
glossed the album’s.sentiments. On Yeezus,

, however, West is himself, as he declared leading

up to the record’s release.

“West was my slave name, Yeezus is my
god name.” -

With that language comes an honesty that
is off~putting for some.

In his recent New York Times interview,
West told Jon Caramanica that he regretted
apologizingfor the Taylorswiftincident. Aside
from the lack of value to Taylor Swift’s musical
existence, West is justiﬁed in this for the sheer
fact that he thought what he was doing was
right, and whether that coincides with public
sensibilities has less to do with the now—self-
proclaimed god than it does with everyone else.

Mr.West’s haughty claims belie an artist who often speaks out for justice. MCT Campus

on “I Am a God,” a song in whichh West — or

Yeezus, rather —— equates hirnselfto a god. As
an artist, Kanye is uncompromising in his vi-
sion, and that comes with insecurity: “We all
self-conscious, I’mjust the ﬁrst to admit it,” he
raps on ‘NI Falls Down,” attack from his 2004
album, The College Dropout.

On Yeezus, we have the same rapper giving
himself — and his art ——'a pep talk, repeat~
ing for his own sake that he can do anything
because what most people don’t understand is
that no matter how many people tell you that
you’re great, the hardest person to convince is
always yourself. I

In that sense, there isn’t a drop ofblasphemy

THE END

andjay Baruchel as themselves and a ﬂeet of
cameos including a sex slave Charming Tatum,
a pillaging Emma Watsonand an existentially
conﬁisedjason Segel, the ﬁlm is a hilariously
successful experiment in meta-aware comedy.
The entire premise of the ﬁlm is relatively
simple: Theworld comes to an end, and after a
sinkhole swallows most of the guests at Fran-
co’s Los Angeles house party, the survivors
barricade themselves inside in an attempt to
survive for as long as possible. Sprinkle in a
few demons and dwindling amounts of sup-
plies, and the ﬁinny men havetheir plot foils.
The six leads hole up indoors as the Apoca-
lypse rages on outside, and the screen time
is equal parts survival efforts and intergroup
mockery. Ripping on each others’ off—stage
personas, the central actors play caricatured

versions of themselves: Rogen is the chubby A

but lovable half—wit; Baruchel is awkward and
slightly whiny; Franco is one—third disgrun-
tled pseudo—intellectual, one—third tortured
‘artist and one-third moron, and McBride is
the most unreﬁned guy in the room.

That being said, the ﬁlm predictably relies
on crude, shock value-heavy humor similar to
thejudd Apatow comedies that made many of
these actors famous. But the self—referential

jeers in “This Is the End” are priceless and
well—done and should be appreciated as such

There’s a slightly intelligent bluntness to
the ﬁlm that works very well, and this blunt-
ness is most obvious when the humor, predi-

cated on pop culture—heavy tropes, is slightly
too obvious. The audience quickly catches on
and realizes that it would be impossible for
the actors to be unaware of how stupid they’re
making each other —«and themselves — look.

“This is the End” draws on the best aspects
of “Knocked Up,” “Superbad” and “Pineapple
Express” —— of which there’s an amphetamine
and hallucinogen—fueled remake by the ﬁlm’s
stars in a totally hysterical, yet slightly ador-
able bro moment. Even better, the characters
themselves can — and do — laugh at the ri-
diculousness at hand, which only compounds
the crowd’s own clamor.

I To produce this movie, Rogen teamed up ’ I

with Evan Goldberg, who has worked with
many of the actors on various Apatow ﬁlms.
This combination seems to have effectively

' toed the line of decency — though, undeni-

ably, there are a few too many penis jokes for
the ﬁlm to be considered highbrow.
“This Is the End” isn’t by any means going

to reinvent the comedy genre or have the larg-

est box oﬂice earnings. But during a summer
when the ﬁeld of comedies has been surpris-
ingly weak thanks to pitiful contenders such
as “The Big Wedding,” “The Hangover Part
III” and “The Internship,” it’s a refreshing
source of hearty laughs and gives groups of
friends plenty of one—liners ready to be taken
home and used for retaliation.

Plus, any movie that features a coke-snort-
ing Michael Cera and the Backstreet Boys
performing “Everybody (Backstreet’s Back)”
in heaven has ‘clearly tapped into some form
of cinematic brilliance. I

MEN’S BASKETBALL

Steven Adams prepared for Thursday’s

* Nate Barnes
Sports Editor

In the 2013 NBA Draft, which takes place
Thursday night at the Barclays Center in
Brooklyn, N.Y., Pitt center Steven Adams

' "could become the ﬁrst Panther selected in

the lottery since the Philadelphia 76ers chose
Charles Smith with the No. 3 overall pick in
1988.

If Adams is selected within the ﬁrst 14
picks Thursday, he will become the second-

« -rhighest draft choice ever out of Pitt and the

highest pick in head coach Jamie Dixon’s
tenure.

“When I go to the NBA, I just want to focus

on blocking shots, rebounding, running the

' lanes, playing defense and setting screens,”

, “Adams said before a workout Monday in Sac-
wramento, Calif. “Then I’ll start to branch off

later on down the track and ﬁgure out what
I want to do.”
Adams averaged just 7.2 points and 6.3

rebounds per game in his only season as a
Panther and announced his decision to de-
clare for the NBA Draft in early April after
he had stated his intentions to return to Pitt.

But given the ﬁnancial burdens that have
overwhelmed his family back in New Zealand,
Adams made the decision to declare.

The 7—foot, 255-pound center is ranked
among the top prospects out of college, and
ESPN’s draft analyst Chad Ford ranks him as
the No. 12 overall prospect in the 2013 NBA

Draft. NBADraft.net ranks Adams as the ‘

draft’s second-best center behind Maryland’s
Alex Len — who some project as the No. 1
overall pick — and the draft’s No. 5 prospect.

Most mock drafts assign Adams’ likely
draft slot in the mid-to-late lottery, with
NBADraft.net placing him at No. 12 to the
76ers and DraﬁExpress.com projecting him as
the No. 10 pick to the Portland Trail Blazers.
Meanwhile, ESPN projects the Oklahoma City
Thunder to select Adams with the No. 12 pick.

The draft projections place Adams ahead
of some of college basketball’s best big men,

including Preseason Player of theYear Cody
Zeller from Indiana and Gonzaga center Kelly
Olynyk. '

Along with his high draft stock, Adams
received an invitation to the green room
Thursday night, which features the players
most likely to be selected in the early half of
the ﬁrst round. ‘ »

Recently, Adams worked out with the

Portland Trail Blazers, the Boston Celtics, - t

the Phoenix Suns, the Utahjazz and the Sac-
ramento Kings, who own the No. 7 pick. His
ﬁnal workout came Monday in Sacramento,
the last day players could work out with teams
before Thursday’s draft.

In Sacramento, Adamsworked out with
Lehigh alum C.J. McCollum, who is expected
to be taken in the top 10 of this year’s draft.
McCollum and Adams matched up in Novem-
ber, when Lehigh visited the Petersen Events
Center, and Adams once again left an impres-
sion on McCol1um seven months later.

BARNES BURNER

Pitt should

have taken

Shell back

Nate Barnes
Sports Editor

It had been quiet for far too long around
Pitt athletics. Since the [departures of
Steven Adams, Trey Zeigler, J.]. Moore-
and Rushel Shell, nothing ridiculous hap-
pened. h

Then one of the departed rose from
the dead, as Rushel Shell chose not to
enroll at UCLA and reportedly expressed
interest in returning to Oakland to again
join the Pitt football team.

Apparently, it was aninterest that was .

‘inever seriously entertained” by Paul

Chryst, according to a report from the "

Pittsburgh Post-Gazette’s Sam Werner.-

This means ,that"Rushel Shell will not -
‘ play at Heinz Field this year . More impor-

tantly, Shell won’t win any football games
for Pitt, which will hurt the program,
since "he was one of the few players with

. an ability to push Pitt to wins it wouldn’t

otherwise record.
Shell’s attempted return to Pitt was

probably one that Chryst probably‘

should’ve “entertained” because — for
one — Pitt football will be a lot less en-
tertaining this fall. \

But, froma persolnfiel perspective,
start with what Pitt has in the backﬁeld:
junior Isaac Bennett andredshirt soph-
omore Malcolm Crockett. Bennett will
likely receive the lion’s share of the car-
ries after playing third fiddle to Shell
and recent graduate Ray Graham while’
Crockettshould see action as Bennett’s
backup.

In 2012, Bennett rushed 29 times for E

141 yards and three touchdowns and post-
ed a solid 4.9 yards per carry despite a
small sample size. Crockett took ju'st_12
hand, offs last season for 50 yards.

So that’s what Pitt has coming back:
41 carries for 191 yards.

Shell almost topped that production in
a ‘single game when he gained 157 yards
on 23 attempts Sept. 15 in'an upset of
then-No. 13 Virginia Tech. ' . .

' Overall, Shell’s production was nearly
five times that of Bennett and Crockett,
as he carried 141 times for 641 yards and
four touchdowns. .

And don’t forget that Shell broke the
WPIAL career rushing record at Hopewell
High School in Aliquippa, Pa., with 9,078
yards. The previous WPIAL career rush-
ing record—holder, Tony Dorsett, won a
Heisman Trophy when he came to Pitt.

Anyone who expresses conﬁdence in
Bennett and Crockett minus Shell either
doesn’t know football or is certifiably in-
sane, and that’s not a knock on Bennett or

Crockett, it’s simply the fact that neither ' ‘
of them are Rushel Shell and neither one

will produce like him. _

Plus, as Pitt officially enters the Atlan-
tic Coast Conference on July 1, the Pan-
thers need every advantage they can get
when transitioning from playing Big East
football to tougher competition in the
ACC, and Shell in a Pitt uniform would’ve
been one huge advantage in Pitt’s favor.

Pitt needs Shell in its backﬁeld this

‘ season and not just for the beneﬁt of its

running game. Having the threat of Shell
would’ve madethe job of redshirt senior
quarterback Tom Savage, Pitt’s probable
starter, exponentially easier. _
Now the pressure will lie solely on
Savage, as the passing game will need to

- bolster a weakened running game. A run-

ning game that requires an elite passer to
compensate for, and neither Aaron Rod-
gers or Tom Brady are walking through
Pitt’s doors in the South Side.

But Shell could have.

Yes, the argument can be made that

4 Shell quit-on Pitt. But he’s a teenager,

and teenagers make mistakes. I didn’t
know what I wanted out of ‘life when I

was 19, -and I doubt most of Pitt’s fanbase .

did either.Had Shell been permitted to
return, .he would’ve likely been subject
to disciplinary action, but not so much

_ as to deny him a second chance. Plus,

there’s something to be said for getting
off one’s moral high horse every once in a
while and doing what’s best for the team.

2' An_ argument was made to me the other

day that Shell .shouldn’t be allowed back
on the team to set a “precedent,” but this
is not the Supreme Court, and precedents
are not the primary concern. — '

A football team is the matter, at hand,

-and the concern is winning football

games. _

I won’t say Pittmade the wrong deci-
sion by rejecting the return of Shell, but
allowing him to return would’ve been the
best decision. Especially when the mat-
ter of winning football games is at hand.

ADAMS 4

“Steven Adams is just a bulldog,” C.J. Mc-

n:::.Collum said. “He destroys everything. He just ‘

dunks everything.”

Adams also turned heads in Boston, nota- ‘

bly that of assistant coachjay Larranaga, who
relayed his thoughts to ESPN Boston.

“I think through these workouts he’s

4,‘ shown maybe more skill than people realized

"he had during his year at Pittsburgh. He was

just a lot of fun to work with,” Larranaga said.

At the NBA'Draft Combine held in May, ES-

PN’s Chad Ford reported that Adams showed

off a “shocking” offensive game and that he

was the “big winner” on the ﬁrst day of the

combine.

“I can say I was honestly stunned,” one
NBA general manager told Ford. “Where did
that come from? That’s not something you de-
velop with a few weeks with a trainer. He was
way more skilled than we thought. That makes
a hugedifference in our evaluation of him.” .

Entering the week, the only subject on
Adams’ mind in terms of adjustments is how
many more games he’ll play, with the higher
skill level an afterthought. For Adams, play-
ing more is probably exactly what he wants.

“The biggest adjustment will probably be
the schedule, 82 games is pretty solid,” Adams
said. “Probably just physicality and skill level

‘PRO.-AM

the highest single—game total scored on

Monday night between the Pro-Am’s three
contests. '
On the perimeter, Robinson ﬁnished

with 25 points of his own on 9—of—15 shoot— .

ing and seven assists. ,
“It was fun,” Robinson said. “I think,
for us, it’s always good to come out here
and play against someone different.”
Opposite Pitt’s likely returning starter
at the point was Jones, who battled with
Robinson through most of the game. With
minutes up for grabs on the perimeter
after the departures of Travon Woodall,

 Cl .f:3’7l .6:

Trey Zeigler andJ.J. Moore,Jones ﬁgures
to compete for some time this fall.

But in the summer, Jones shouldered
the scoring load for Oliverio with 24
points along with six rebounds and ﬁve
assists. _, ' ' . '

“We battle all the time,” Jones said
about the competition between himself
and Robinson. “We just wanted to keep

it going here on the court.”

Redshirtjunior guard Cameron Wright

and transfer Derrick Randall were also-

slated to play withJones for Oliverio, but

» did not participate Monday.

SPK Law 34, UPMC 78

While‘Patterson nearly messed around
and got a triple—double for SPK on Mon-
day, Young stole the show with a dominant

A second—half performance that allowed

SPK to overcome a 40-34 halftime deﬁcit

against UPMC. I _ _ V
Artis, Newkirk and Johnson paced

UPMC, and the pair of incoming fresh-

~ menplayed a crucialrole in helping their‘

team to a halftime lead. Johnson, who
ﬁnished with 15 points, struggled from
the field in his first game ofthe summer,
shooting 6—for—17. C‘ . ' ' ’
But, back to Young, the freshman.
scored eight points in the ﬁrstfew min-
utes of thesecond half to help SPK tie the
score at 45. Young ﬁnished with 17 in the
quarter as SPK led by as much as eight
with under two minutes to play. . \.

Artis and Newkirk spurred a quick run, .

which pulled UPMC to within four at 82-
78 with under a minute on the clock, but
SPK kept the game under control to notch
a 84—78,victory. .
Patterson ﬁnished with 27‘ points on
9—of—16 shooting along with 12 rebounds
and six assists. Patterson also connected
on 4—of—8 attempts from beyond the arc
— the most made by any player Monday.
“He can put the ball in the basket,
score, pass, so it’s fun playing with a guy
like that,” Young said. ’

Mike Lecak also hit '2-of-7 3~point at- .

tempts, but ﬁnished 3—of-8‘ from theiﬁeld
with eight points and one assist.

But the star was Young, whose domi: '

narit second half resulted in an overall line
of 22 points on 8—for-13 shooting with 10

rebounds. Young also went 6-for-7 from

the free—throw line.‘ » .

“I tried to put a little imprint on the
game, that’s all,” Young said. “We had’ a
few of our guys on the other team, so it was
fun to go at them in a real game setting.

Besides Young, Artis and Newkirk
should have a'chance to make an early
impact at Pitt, and both players demon-
strated that ability Monday night. Ar-
tis scored 16 points and pulled in seven
boards for UPMC while Newkirk added
12 points and five assists. I

“I feel like, for the most part, we all
did good,” Young said of the trio’s per-
formance. “We came out here and showed
what we can do with the opportunities
we had.” I
