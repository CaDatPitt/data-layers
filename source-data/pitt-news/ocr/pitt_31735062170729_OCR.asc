The Packagingtot Peace

by GAYLORD SHAW
Associated Press Writer

WASHINGTON (AP) — Nearly
two weeks ago Henry Kissinger
flashed word across the Atlantic
to President Nixon that major in-
gredients _of a Vietnam peace
agreement had been reached.

The negotiator’s cable, it now
appears, set in motion a carefully
orchestrated series of events that
offer a textbook lesson in how to
package peace.

Step by step, announcement by

_ announcement, Nixon and his key

White House aides — several of

them advertising agency execu-

tives—built toward ‘the dramatic
conclusion.

That came Tuesday night when

“ Nixon, sitting behind his oval of-

- fice desk, watched for the cam-
era’s red light to blink on and told
the nation:

"Good evening. I have asked for
this radio and television time to-
night for the purpose of announc-
ing that we today haveconcluded
an agreement to end the war and
bring peace with honor in Viet-
nam and in Southeast

and implementation.

Emphasize Service Projects

'Ft‘OSl'lf Honorary Slates

by JOHN POULIN

Phi Eta Sigma. a national hon-
or fraternity for freshmen who
have excelled academically, is
presently preparing invitational
zlietters for all eligible freshmen.
According to Larry Gluck, pres-
ident of the Pitt chapter, “The let-
ters will be distributed in the next
few weeks and initiation will take
place round the first week in
March."

Gluck lists the qualifications
for induction as 1) a minimum
QPA of 3.5. 2) full-time academic
status, and 3) no incomplete
grades. At present, Phi Eta Sig-
ma is distinct from the women‘s
honorary, Cwens.

Although the primary function
-of the organization is to recog-
nize students for scholastic
achievement, Gluck points out

that Phi Eta Sigma is more than
just a “pat on the back.” Meetings
are held monthly for the purpose
of directing the group’s activ-
ities.

Guest speakers are sponsored
to which the public is invited. Re-
cently, Pitt's ' Dr. Hansen des-
cribed his China visit, and’ Dr.
Mulhare of Carlow College spoke
on witchcraft. .

The group also helps out in va-
rious special productions, such as
the upcoming “Chinese Week."

Members of Phi Eta Sigma also
assist students transferring to
Pitt by advising them in their
course selections. Gluck says,
“The society offers the active
member the chance to do some-
thing constructive for the Univer-
sity, while at the same time, ful-

filling his own academic inter-_

ests.’ ’

lieved the argreement was bas-
ically wrapped up. In fact, accord-"
ing to some accounts, he was
ready to initial it then and there.

But Nixon wanted Kissinger to
come back to the United States for
consultations. And he wanted to
touch base with South Vietnamese
President Nguyen Van Thieu,
whose balkiness earlier had help-
ed torpedo soaring peace hopes-
an atmosphere of optimism fed by
Kissinger’s “peacegis at hand”
statement Oct. 26.

The first hint of the Nixon plan
came in an off-‘hand comment by
a White House official on Friday,
Jan. 12. “You’re going to be plen-
ty busy down there,” the official
told a newsman after Press Sec-
retary Ronald L. Ziegler announc-
ed that Nixon would be going to
his Key Biscayne, Fla., home that
day.

The President, said Ziegler,
would be spending two or three
days in Florida working on his
inaugural address. I

Before dawn the next morning,
however, reporters were awaken-
ed in their Miami hotel rooms by
telephone calls from Ziegler. Kiss-
inger was coming immediately to
Key Biscayne, Ziegler announced,

-to confer with Nixon after six

days of “serious negotiations”
with Thb.

The predawn calls marked the
first time-any U.S. official had
publicly confirmed that the re-

Creativity and Sensitivity

Pre-requisite

by DEBBIE POPP

In preparation for the 1973-74
school year, the Office of Resi-
dence Life has begun the process
of selecting Resident Assistants.
Applications for approximately 40
positions are available in the
Residence-Life Office in Tower C.
The deadline for the completed
applications is Feb. 5.

Miriam Hirst, Coordinator of
Residence Life and the Resident
Assistant Selection Committee,
anticipates filling the RA open-
ings with senior and graduate stu-
dents who exhibit leadership qual-
ities and generate a spirit of self-
discipline.

The applicants will be evaluated
on their ability to display imagin-
ation, creativity, and sensitivity
when working with residence stu-
dents, according to Hirst. The RA
is to look for creative ways to im-
prove and innovate the existing
environment of the Halls. They
are also responsible for the phy-
sical aspects of the building and
maintenance reports on safety
problems.

RAs are required to stay with-
in the residence hall from 7 p.m.
to 7 a.m. four nights out of seven
to handle emergencies and to
council students.

The renumeration for the time
and service the RA renders is
room and board, a single room,

for R.A.

and a telephone for campus calls.

The qualification for the RA ap-
pointments include being a sen-
ior or graduate student with a
minimum QPA of 2:5 as of Sep-
tember, 1973, with one year of ex-
perience of living in a University
residence hall.

The application for RA requires

four references, previous work .
and travel experience, and a list \,

of special interests accompanied
with routine personal data. The
student is also required to hand in
a typed statement answering four
personal attitude questions on the
application. ‘

The initial step of the RA se-
lection process will end on Feb. 5
when the completed applications
are returned to the Office of Res-

idence Life. From Feb. 26 through‘

March 2, information sessions
will be held with the applicants

A and two present RA’s to discuss '

facets of the job. Applications will
then be reviewd by the coordina-

tor of Residence Life from March

2 to March 7.

Personal interviews by Miriam
Hirst, two head residents, two
RAs, and two students will take
place from March 15 to April for
final consideration of the appli-
cants. I

will be sent to the applicants 011:’

Interracial Dating Examined  

by KARL BALDYS

On Tuesday night the Intercul-
tural House, an experiment in in-
terracial living, sponsored a sem-
inar on Interracial Dating and
Living. Speakers included Dr.’s
Reginald D.‘Sevayega and Rollo
Turner, along with Walt Smith, di-
rector of the IC House and a panel
of black and white students.

Dr, Sevayega opened the sem-

. inar with the question "How did

this nonsense begin?” He sighted

Inciuctions

Gluck cites two continuing con-
cerns of Phi Eta Sigma as fami-
liarizing the student body with the
organization, and stirring new en-
thusiasm in its members. He
feels that the fraternity is “un-
known to many students," and
that making it more i familiar
would boost the percentage of
qualified freshmen who join.

"To appeal to more members."
says Gluck. “speakers of general
interest have been selected, rath-
er than those concerned with spe-
cific disciplines."

There is also the possibility of
coordinating Phi Eta Sigma with
the activities o_f the women’s hon-
orary, Cwens. However, some im-
mediate complications would
arise in that both organizations
are on the national level and have
different eligibility requirements.

some of the more famous and pop-
ular interracial daters,  . .
George ‘ Washington, Thomas Jef- ’
ferson,,and Patrick Henry.” He
went from there to discuss the un-
reasonable racist condemnation
of interracial couples as a func-/

» tion of a sick white-male dom-

inated society.

“If you hate racism,” said Sav-
eyega, “if you can see people in-
terracial dating, know that they
are not sick. This society is sick.”
He went on to say that many coun-_
tries in South America and Afri-
ca have no racial problem. He re-
lated the tremendouswarmth, and
love he found on his trips to Afri-
ca, as a black man, and comment-
ed, “It is a sickness in this coun-
try where racial lines aredrawn.

. . . Any man who draws a line and .

says who I can relate to is insane.”
Turner approached interracial

dating as a complex problem of‘

multi-dimensions. In talking
about interracial dating on a two
dimension plane (i.e., black per-
son dates white person) one part
of this audience becomes defen-
sive while the other half becomes

releived . . . this placing of blame »

is part of the problem.” He con-

tinued, “We have to judge each V

case on its individual merits.”

“that people who are reacting in-
terracially are oblivious to the im-
plications of race . . . to a degree,

Staggering in Lives and Dollars 

Vietnam Casts Noted  

by THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

For everyone involved, the cost of the Vietnam war has been stag-
gering, both in terms of lives and dollars. Here is a quick look at some

of those costs.

/'

CASUALTIES: The Pentagon says 45,928 Americans were killed
in action, and more than 300,000 were wounded between 1961 and the
end of 1972. The South Vietnamese command says 180.676 of its troops
and an estimated 921,350 North Vietnamese and Viet Cong were, killed

in the same period.

The U.S. Senate Subcommittee on Refugees estimates civilian

casualties in South Vietnam at 415,000 killed and 935,000 wounded from
1965 through 1972. I

That upbeat trend accelerated
on Thursday when Ziegler, stand-
ing behind microphones in the one-
time display apartment which
serves as a Florida White House
press room, announced that Kiss-
inger would return to Paris the
following Tuesday for the purpose
of “completing the text of an
agreement." '

He wouldn’t elaborate and care-
fully avoided any display of opti-
mism. But,‘ although unspoken.
the message -was clear: peace
was indeed at hand.

Nixon’s cryptic references to
Vietnam in his Saturday inaugur-
al address —— the longest and most
costly war in American history is
drawing to a close, he said——offer-

ed no specifics. But, at the same
time, it did nothing to deflate the
peace-is-at-hand mood.

Kissinger flew to Paris on Mon-
day to complete “the text of an
agreement.” But. it now appears.
the text already had been com-

pleted on a lower level by teams,
of technical experts.

Nixon's adviser and Tho spent
less than four hours going over
the lengthy documents before
both affixed their initials and
Kissinger headed home.

By the time he landed at An-
drews Air Force Base, techni-
cians were installing broadcast
equipment in Nixon’s oval office.
The President’s package of peace

proceeded to describe role defini-

He said, “We have to say more

Womens Studies

Program Interest Poor

lay LOIS ELDER

The Women’s Studies Program
held a colloquium Monday dealing
with job discrimination due to
sex. The speaker,.who was a rep-
resentative from the Pennsyl-
vania Human Relations Commis-
sion, a co-ordinator, two observ-
ers, and four members of the
news media were the only people
attending the meeting.

Monday’s lecture was the first
of the term and, according to Pat
Buddemeyer, administrative aide
for Women’s Studies, the low at-
tendance could have been caused
for a number of reasons.

Buddemeyer said, “We always
send out leaflets advertising the
programs to people who have
shown -interest in the Women’s
Studies Program in the past. An-
nouncements are also sent to all
the University departments to be
posted. We put posters on the bul-
letin boards on campus, but the
boards are always crammed with
notices of so many other pro-
grams, no one_pays attention.

“We sent out letters and an-

nouncements telling about pro-
grams that would be held on Jan.

' 15 and 22. But when we found the

15th was a holiday, we had to can-
cel the program and we didn’t get

notices of the cancellation out on

time.”
,-“The saturation of having a

program every week could be an-
other factor in low attendance.”

1 Possibly, people will postpone‘go-

ing to a program if ‘ they know
there will be another one the next

week.

"Having only an hour for the-

program doesn‘t help either.“
Buddemeyer added. “There us-
ually isn’t enough time to have the

presentation and answer .ques- .

tions too.

"And the publicity is often con-
fusing and hectic when trying to
announce a different program ev-
ery week.”

Future Women’s Studies Pro-
grams include “The Japanese
Women in Modern Society.” Kar-
en —Marsten, a Ph.D. candidate
from GSPIA will be the speaker.
The program is. scheduled for
Jan. 29.

On Feb. 5, Mark Senick, a rep- I

resentative from the Pennsyl-
vania Human Relations Commis-
sion will talk about “Racism and
Sexism.” He will discuss the sim-
ilarities and differences in sexual
discrimination and racial dis-
crimination with statistics and
cases from the Pennsylvania Hu-
man Relations Commission.

Charlotte Ginsberg will speak
Feb. 12 on “The Problems of the

Female Offender.” She is a rep-  

resentative from the Pennsyl-
vania Program for Girl and Wom-
en Offenders and will discuss
Pennsylvania institutions  for
women and will show slides.

What Went Wrong In Indochina

An AP News Analysis
By WILLIAM L. RYAN
AP Social Correspondent

What went wrong for the United States in Indochi-
na?

‘ How could intentions regarded at the outset as hon-

orable by most Americans bring results that ultimately

2 7 would be widely" denounced around the world?

Historians will be a long time probing the evidence.

he They are likely to label a lot of key U.S. actions and

'4 decisions as unqualified and extravagantly costly blun-

ders.

From the vantage point of hindsight, some of the
early judgments already being made go something like
this: _

1. Early alarm signals went unheeded.

Early in the game, as Americans began to get in-
volved in a war they didn’t understand, some U.S.

he leaders who would share responsibility for the policy

of involvement were themselves fearful that the United.

States was painting itself into a corner. Those same
leaders eventually helped wield the paint brush.

An alarm signal came in November 1961 in a cable

 , to President John F. Kennedy from Gen. Maxwell Tay-

lor. Assessing the situation in Vietnam, Taylor noted

 that an engagement of U.S. prestige likely would be

-deepened proportionately by the number of U.S. troops .

committed. ,
If results were not achieved quickly, he said, “it

*  will be difficult to resist the pressure to reinforce.”

Another alarm was sounded that same month by
:Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara. He told the
President in a memorandum that introduction of a siz-

” able U.S. force would not have decisive effect, but

would make it almost certain that the United States

’ 7 -would “get increasingly mired down in an inconclusive

‘ I struggle.”

2. The United States, with its eyes open, went into

i . . a war that by some standards was unwinnable.

As late as June 1965, after the big escalation had

 if/started, a memorandum by Secretary of'State Dean Rusk
 «noted: ‘

“Once we suffer large casualties we will have

 started a well-nigh irreversible process. Our involve-

ment will be so great that we cannot without national
humiliation stop short of achieving our complete ob-

lexgjectives. _Of the two possibilities, I think humiliation
1* L would be the more likely than achievement of our ob-

  

’  jectives —- even after_we have paid terrible costs.”

3. U.S. Southeast Asia policy was murky.

I. i There was hardly any Southeast Asia policy until
.'-Korea caused U.S., planners to improvise hastily. What
.-"resulted _was closely connected to a fear that another
‘ area might be “lost” as China -was “lost” to the Com-

1-, munists.

The China episodeehad produced political dynamite

in the McCarthy era. Thereafter, the reading of U.S.

cold war stakes became a matter of assuming a world

 Communist goal’ to gobble up Asia. When Lyndon B.
* . Johnson became President, he said he would not be the
”  man to see Southeast Asia go “the way China went.”

4. The United Stateswas embarrassed by its own

'  power.

Involvement in an undeclared war meant war little

by little, unsupported by any homefront mobilization.
The expressed U.S. anxiety was to prevent a wide war.

The Americans had power enough to destroy all
Vietnam at one blow many times over, but could not
and would not use it. Thus, at the start, the United
States was getting itself gradually drawn into a partial
war, limited to what were regarded as minimal mea-
sures to stop the Communists.

5. Americans were confused and bewildered.

Until 1963, few Americans had any idea where In-
dochina might be on the map. They became acutely

, aware of it with the crisis of November 1963, when

President Ngo Dinh Diem was assassinated. The Com-
munists chose that time of upheaval to step up pressure.

- Gradually, Americans became aware they were involv-

ed in a shadowy, hit-and-run jungle guerrilla conflict.

/
1/‘

Americans were involved with an Asian ally who
could be the most frustrating of partners. Early in the
game observers on the scene wondered who was in
charge: the U.S. commander, the U.S. ambassador or
the mixed-up Saigon regime.

6. Prospective costs outweighed. U.S. interests and
objectives. ‘

Apparently, costs and interests were away out of
balance. The United States did not appear to have a
clearly defined objective other than keeping the Com-

munist out of control of the South.

‘However, once the United States pronounced Viet-

nam vital to its interests, it seemed necessary to hold _

on at any cost. Until recently, the idea that Vietnam
was vital to American interests was ‘automatically ac-
cepted gospel in Washington. ’

7. There was a lack of coherent and consistent
strategy.

The strategy seemed just to grow, willy nilly, with
the increasing involvement. Soon the United States was,
figuratively speaking, using sledgehammers to kill fleas.
Enormously expensive planes and military hardware were
committed to flattening huts, blasting sampans and at-
tacking jungle shadows. It was testimony both to the
lack of American experience in Southeast Asia and a
U.S. urge to apply technological power to vexing prob-
lems.

8. The Americans failed to learn from the Malaya
experience of the early 1950’s.

The insurgency on the Malay Peninsula had been
beaten by clear-and-hold tactics, using the guerrillas’
own methods against them. In Vietnam, the Americans
relied on enormous fire-power,. incredibly powerful air
fleets, a naval armada, swarms of helicopters and jeeps
and all manner of other hardware.

In turn, this cataract of material and men pouring
into the little country produced a social upheaval with it
all manner of corruption. ‘

The power also did considerable propaganda harm
through the_wrecking of villages, suffering inflicted on
civilians and bombing errors causing heavy casualties.

9. The cost of bombing the North balanced against
its usefulness. ' -

Some» competent observers say‘ the bombing of the
North may have been the greatest strategic blunder of
the war. With respect to impairing the North’s fight-
ing capacity, the effect seemed negligible.

In the long run ‘the bombing appeared to react
against the United States, first by hardening North Viet-

namese morale and then by bringing down wide con- --";;-

demnation. If the United States was trying to bomb
Hanoi to the negotiating‘ table before 1968, the reality
was that after that year’s Tet offensive the United
States itselfwas the one that was pushed in the direc
tion of the table. ‘

- 10. The aim to make North Vietnam pay dearly
backfired.

The policy is regarded now by many _to have been
counter-productive and another error. The more price
the Communists paid, the more stake they had in stick-
ing it out.

Open societies are no match for totalitarian ones
when it comes to propaganda warfare. The North Viet-
namese were not obliged to be responsible to an elec-
torate. The leaders could continue tenaciously to try
to justify the investment in their ambition to rule the
whole country.

11. The Americans lost sight of their immediate «*1

goal.

All presidents involved in the Vietnam situation had
said the U.S. aim simply was to make,it possible for
the South Vietnamese to choose their own future with-
out interference. The Americans insisted it was the Viet-
namese whohad to be responsible for Vietnam.

The war progressed in an opposite direction, how-
ever. The South Vietnamese became all client, and for

‘a long time everything depended on the Americans.

South Vietnam’s presidents and politicians became hea-
vily dependent upon American support.

At the same time, an American stake developed in
keeping the Saigon regime in power, to an extent that it
seemed at times the Saigon tail was wagging the U.S.
dog. ' ’

best that two second rate groups could be hired.
.Acting on the decision, the Greeks and Engineers joined forces

, and formed a concert board. It consists of six individuals—three from

each group—and is headed by Chairwoman Chris Crawford. Jim

 . Stana is the representative for the Engineers. Their co-efforts narrow-

. ‘ed the list of groups. The Steve Miller Bandgand Seals and Crofts were

the top two choices for the, concert to be held at the Syria Mosque.

However, theboard has run into a number of major problems. In
the words of Paul Wasilko, secretary of the Engineering Student Cabi-

"net: “The decision to have one concert now seems to have been a bad

one. -
__ It appears that the method of choosing the list of groups proceed-

I ed in an unrealistic way. Neither the Steve Miller Band nor Seals and

Crofts are touring in March and there was some doubt as to whether or

not they could be hired. They both also played in Pittsburgh just last

Sha-Na-Na, and a comedian to be named later.

Another majorproblem is that the Syria Mosque seats only 3,800
people. Acoustically it is better than adequate place to hear a concert.
But if all students are to have an opportunity to benefit in a student
sponsored program, the concert will be in trouble before it starts.

fusion. Nowhere in the University area is there a really good place to
hold such concerts. If you think the Civic Arena is, you have not had to
sit through a concert knowing that your seat is in the middle of an
acoustic “dead-spot.” . 1

To me it seems unusual that such adverse conditions do exist. For
this is not the case in many other big cities around the nation. There
are just as many thousands of music lovers here as there are in Los
Angeles, San Francisco, New York, Chicago, and Philadelphia. It is also
unfortunate when students dedicate their sincere efforts and energies
to a goal, and they find that there are so many absurd obstacles being
thrown in their way.- 1

One consolation is‘that Pitt has recently employed the services of
Martin Klein, who is a national booking agent. At least, in the future we
will know who is touring and when. The Engineers and Greeks could
have done much worse. Sea Train is a top quality group. ' ,

It is difficult to wade through
all the roles and myths that have
defined femininity, togather from
all the falsehoods of culture the
truth about being female. To
find and keep within oneself a
whole sense of what I am as a
woman requires painful self-
examination, moments of joy in
new freedoms, the awkwardness
of relearning how to be with
people in a way that opens them
to your person, an acceptance of
hostility and anger in oneself.
and a hunger for self-love.

No theatrical, experience has
expressed to me the range of the
feelings inherent in the above
processes like the current Studio
Theatre offerings, Megan Terry’s
Comings and Goings and The
Gleaming, Oh My Darling. Dif-
ferent in style, together they are
everyplace I have ever been as a
woman and everywhere I could
go as a woman; .

Somehow directors Cathy Sak-
in and Nicolette Gramatikos and
their actors have pooled their
knowledge in a way that touch-
es you in a hundred sensitive
spots; with hilarity, quiet secret
smiles and the bittersweet sorrow
of having lost yourself for a while.
Traditional realism is replaced
by the experimental and openly
theatrical tricks of transforma-
tional theatre.

The make-believe aspect of an
evening in the theatre is gently
mocked. The audience is seated
facing the entrance to the Studio,
marked“Exit”. Thus our position
isperfect for viewing the remain-
der of the audience, an integral
part of the pattern of prepara-
tion for the theatrical experience.

The music accompanying this

event is fifties rock-style muzak,
occasionally interrupted by a
commercial for Fashion Hosiery.
We are ironically set up for Com-
ings and Goings, appropriately
termed a theatre exercise.

Director Sakin cleverly manip-
ulates our realization of the thea-
tricality of theatre. The actors,
under harsh gymnasium lighting,
bring in the set, consisting of
two benches, two-wooden boxes,
the referee’s stool and the red and
gold wheel of fortune. All this
is done to silent-movie fast mo-
tion music, introducing them to
us as cartoon characters.

They are dressed in athletic

shorts and Pitt tee shirts with

numbers on the back. Knee guards
and tennis shoes complete the
costumes. Referee Layne Wil-
liams’ brilliant red attire to top-
ped off by a baseball cap which
she wears rakishly to one side.
The contest begins, men on one
bench, women on the other. The
rest of the play involves a male
and female pitted against one
another in various situations in-
terspersed with mechanical im-
provisations.

. Much of the excitement derives
from the arbitrary timing ofithe
referee. Players are directed to
their roles by the spin of the
wheel at certain intervals. For
example, actor No. 2 and actress
No. 17 are in the middle of a
short skit, the whistle blows.
Both freeze in place. The wheel
is spun, referee calls out “l5-3”.

These players exchange places
with 17 and 2 amid cheers from
each side. The skit continues
with the gum-chewing support
of both teams. Amazingly, none
of this is preplanned. Each actor

Studio's Double Bill Scruiinizes F

may be called ‘upon to do a role
befitting his or her sex at any-
time.

The nature of this play makes
individual criticism of actors im-
possible and unimportant. It is
the group feeling for what does
happen between women and men
in this society that determines the
evening’s success. Sakin is to be
congratulated for helping her
actors: Granada Lewis, Donna
Linder, Julie Quinio, Edwin Ru-
pert, Mark Schuler, Michael Ste-

’ ger, and Paula Swart, feel com-

fortable enough with each other
and themselves to explore the re-
lationships women and men fall
into.

It is all there, the oppression
of a wife leaving her husband
who orders her to stay, the mind-
less pattern that develops after
living with someone, the pat-
ernalism and’ maternalism that
dominate, the exultation of see-
ing a woman as God Zapping
men ‘down, the symbolic struggle
of a sperm fertilizing an egg, the
viscious cycle of frustrations as
an unsatisfied wife martyr-like
taunts her husband with the needs
he can’t fulfill, the implications

‘of the customer-waitress interac-

tion, the romantic ideals of love
as ridiculous as a musical inter-
lude of “Upin the Air, Junior
Birdmen”.

The basis for the above comple-
xities can be found in the script,
but the realityof them can only
be comprehended in demanding
pouts and triumphant smiles.
There is one skit which concerns
a woman recalling to a, man a
day they had spent on a beach.
It made little sense in the text,
but to watch a woman hold a
man in her arms and in the sing-

song voice of mother to child re-
late what seemed like a fairy-
tale.

Suddenly, it was obvious. How
many times does the past of a
love relationship take on a myth-
ical quality that has an almost
religious connotation for the
people? How often does woman
find herself in the role of ego-
soother for a male?

The Gleaming, Oh My Darling
has an entirely different approach
to much the same subject. The
scope is smaller, but the depth
and intensity are greater. Mrs.
Tweed played by Stephanie Fitz-
gerald and Kathleen Conlin as
Mrs. Watermelon are two old
charming Irish inmates of an in-
stitution for the aged. They have
kidnapped a senile, comatose In-
dian fighter, Mr. Birdsong, (Bar-
ry Klassel) from the men’s ward,
and are hidinglhim from the out-
side in Mrs. Watermelon’s bed.

The outside world hed by “Big
Nurse” Ann Haggarty is -cruel
and inhuman. The families who
"come to visit are like puppets,
“doing their duty”. Their acting
style is rigidly mechanistic in
contrast to Fitzgerald, Conlin,
and Klassel who are endearingly
human, warm figures.

The major problem is the argu-
ment between the two ladies as
to who is to be Mrs. Birdsong.
They finally agree that they will
share him since “the Mormons
did it and God didn’t get mad at
them.” Conlin and Fitzgerald are
so beautifully old, hunched and
doddering, terrified of being
alone.

Collections of all life’s ages,

more complete sense than the
moment. ’

There is a continuity of all as- -

performances and the play. There

is the pathetic situation of the .

not to be. And there is also a‘ ,.
sense of strength and pride in”
friendship, and ima-_ .

ector Nicolette Gramatikos, comes

over the shedding of cumbersome

According to the buildup given by their publicity man, the Pan-

of the 10 best schools in the country, and figured to breeze

The pin‘, or fall, as it is called in college wrestling is likea
Mays‘ grand slam. or a Graziano kayo—the great equalizer. a big
six points. Sadly. pins are a something less than rare happening
on the Panther squad.

The Cats have yet to register a fall this season. Even the

slight number of near falls seems to indicate a need for the mat-

men to go after their men more often. A pin scored against a
team puts great pressure on the opposing team’s remaining
lineup, a pressure that could force the other unit into mistakes.
and, hopefully, a loss.

It is worth noting that the Panthers, while not pinning, are

not getting beaten with their scapulas to the mat: in six matches
only one fall has been registered on them. ’
Adams’ squad is y0ung—at times his lineup contains only
one A senior—and the freshmen and sophomores are wrestling
well, for the most part. ’

They_will improve as they get in more actual meet experi-
ence. “Some of these kids are just finding out what they can do,"
Adams said after the Navy meet. “With a little meet competi-
tion they’re going to be real tough to beat.” All season he has in-

sisted that “these kids are really going to surprise a lot of peo- _

ple come tournament time.”

Meanwhile, the wrestling team’s successes and failures
have gone by virtually unnoticed by the student body. At times
there have seemed to be more restrooms than fans—at the
Maryland meet a paltry turnout of 642 witnessed a good match

- —and a win for Pitt.

The lack of support for the team, which Adams contends
represents the students themselves, is a major disappointment
to him, especially in view of the quality of opposition and the
actual excitement of the meets. ' _

. It was a sad fact that the Lehigh fans comprised nearly half
the attendance and almost all of the vocal support. A little more

fan support could have turned those losing meets around for

' the Cats, who seem to be victims of apathy.

The next league contest for the
Pitt Hockey Club isn’t until Jan.
31. but the icers aren’t sitting
still. Tomorrow night at 7:30 p.m.
Pitt will battle Navy at the Alpine
Ice Chalet in their second exhibi-
tion contest since the Duquesne
game. ‘

The Naval Hockey Club has been
in existence for three years but
this season it hasn’t been involved
in intercollegiate play. Navy does
participate in the Chesapeake
Bay League, which is comprised
of local club teams. The Middies
stand 2-2-1 in their division.

In those five games, Steve She-
grod has emerged as Navy’s lead-
ing scorer with six goals. Bob
Nesslerod will start in goal for
Navy against Pitt. Nesslerod is
experienced, having been with the
team since its organization.

Pitt‘ will sponsor buses for stu-

dents" wishing to attend the con-
test. Buses will leave from the

, Fifth Ave. side of the Student Un-

ion at 7 p.m. Tickets for the ex-
hibition game will be $1 if pur-

gate. The ducats are available at

to score against in the country.
Playing his quintet as one of Phil-
ly’s Big 5, Litwack has kept his
squad respectable against the
best.

But time has finally caught up
with him. A case of stomach ul-
cers almost forced the veteran
coach out of the college ranks two
years ago and it was only with
grave reservationudid he decide
to continue coaching. Now finally
he has given in to his health.

With Litwack goes an era in
Temple basketball. “The Chief”
will lead his warriors no more.

THE Pitt gymnastic team lost
another meet last Wednesday,
this time against West Vir-
ginia by a score of 132.40-90.90.

The team got only one first
place as Dick Pribis, who was
competing with a head cold, got
first place in the floor exercises.
The only second place was from
Bog Rogers who placed in the
pommel horse.

Two freshmen who show a
lot of promise, Gary Wolf and
Cliff Custer, participated in the
meet with Custer on'the rings
and Wolf on the still rings and

showings.

KSU Golden Flashes

by YAIER LEHRER

The‘ Pitt swim team will be in its toughest meet of the season to-
night as they travel to Kent, Ohio, to meet the Golden Flashes of Kent
State.

Kent State is 3-1. losing only to Ohio State by a close margin. Ohio
State is rated fifth in the country.

The KSU team has a man in each event who could very possibly
beat Pitt’s best man in each race. The 400-yard medley relay will put
its undefeated slate on the line against this tough Kent State team.

Says Coach Bradshaw, “We know that they are a stronger team but
we’re not going to let it affect us psychologically. We will aim for per-
sonal improvement and try to improve our times. We feel that as a dual
meet team we could use some improvement but we find that we are
a good championship team and shouldbe sending a good number of
swimmers to the ECAC championships.” '

The team will still be without the services of Mark Wintersland
Jerry O’Leary. in the distance events. Ron Bokulic, though, will par-
ticipate in the 500-yard race in which he did well last week.

Coach Bradshaw will be putting a swimmer who normally parti-
cipates in three events in only two events in an effort to improve the
times of the individual swimmers. ’

There will probably be some close races. Among them are Gerry
Muske of Kent State against Mark Wallace in the backstroke and Jeff
Horvath against John Templin the 200-yard breaststroke.

In the diving events, Kent State has an outstanding diver by the
name of Gary Bishop who should give Jeff Miller and Jack Garrow
quite a run for their money. Miller has qualified for the NCAA’s as has
Mark Wallace. ‘

One of the reasons this meet will most likely be out of reach is be-

cause of the outstanding scholarship program that exists at Kent State
and the school’s are able to recruit extremely good swimmers.

In order to become a good dual meet team, the Panthers are go-
ing to have to pick up some more freestyle swimmers as well as an in-
dividual medley man.

The best the team can hope for in this meet is to come closer to

Kent State than they did against Bucknell. The only thing the fans can -

do is look towards the future to the coming meets where the Cats should
start to pick up the slack.
