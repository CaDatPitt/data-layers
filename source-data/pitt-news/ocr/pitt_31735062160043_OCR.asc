“Get the engineers in June, or you don’t get them at

all,” Major John C. Prosser,

nesday.

chief of the selective service

inanpower division, told a group of industrialists on Wed-

‘ Major Prosser spoke before the Pittsburgh Personnel

Jan. 16. He also pointed‘out’t
men get a deferment.

In answering a question from
the audience, Prosser said that he
asked “all local. boards to give

, careful consideration to engineers

and their requests for 2-A classi-
'ﬁcations.” The 2-A classiﬁcation is
given to those men in essential in-
dustry.

’ Notify Boards

He advised those ﬁrms which
are recruiting engineers before
they gradu‘ate,’to write the draft
board if they think they are go-
ing to hire a man. “Tell them,”
he said, “that you’re thinking of
hiring Bill Jones in June, and that
he will be employed in essential
industry.” '

“If Jones goes to work for you,”
Prosser continued, “them write the
board and tell them so. He will, in
all probability, get the deferment.”

Major Prosser also said’ that the
big secret in getting the best co-
operation from draft boards is “to
keep them constantly informed.”

Eligible To Age y 35

A man classiﬁed in 2-A is sub-
jpct, however, to military duty
until he reaches the rage of 35.
“And I might point out,” said
Prosser, “that we intend to get
him if possible. If we give a man
a deferment in industry, we ex-

Print Shop T urns Out Everything

From Rainbows. To Birth Notices

By IRENE ROZAKIS

A printer’s life isn’t always black and white.
In fact, it even came in 32 colors one year for George
 Langdale, the University. printer.

Usually Mr. Langdale concerns himself with the less,

colorful jobof printing programs
for university functions, posters
for the bulletin boards, and those
nasty little forms that the stu-
dents ﬁll out during. registratibn.
Psychologist’s Idea

The 32 colors, however, entered

the lanky printer’s life as a result

of a 'psychologists'“pet theory. The

ego-prober had an idea that color-
blind individuals were criminally
inclined. In an attempt to prove it,
he asked the print shop to print a
number of col-or-wheels,‘ having
32 different shades i.n all.

This was probably the hardest

, piece of printing done during the

33-year history of the print shop,
according to “Mr. Langdale who
added, “You can imagine what we
had to do with this job, when you
consider that the ordinary color
wheel .-seldom contains more than
seven colors.” ‘
Prints Directory ‘

The print shop which is buried
in the basement of the dental
school, is run by the University

and handles the printing of most.

of the stationery and booklets, in-
cluding the University Phone Di-
rectory.
Mr.
Chautauqua Institution, s t a t e d
that the original purpose of the

print shop was to teach the print-

ing business to would-be teachers.
When this department of the
University moved to Carnegie
Tech, the shop was utilized for the
various printing chores of the uni-
versity.
Tables Turned A
Langdale recalls the time a pro-

fessor asked him to prepare birth

announcements for a coming baby.
If a boy, the boy was to be named
Bob. If _a girl, she would be called
Betty. .
, The day the profs wife went to
the hosiptal, the printer had two
differentvplates set up, one bear-
ing the name Bob\ and one the
name Betty.
The expectant dad phoned that

Students Laud Choice
Of Dawson as Coach

By ALICE SCHUCHERT
Pitt students responded enthusiastically in favor of the
recent appointment of Lowell “Red” Dawson as head foot-

ball coach at Pitt, according to

a poll taken by the Pitt News.

The question asked was, “What
do you think of ‘Red’ Dawson as
head football coach at Pitt?”

Bob Lyles, Bus. Ad. ’53: “I think
the University Athletic Committee

, has made an excellent selection for

our coach. We can certainly ex-
pect a winning team, one worthy
of our university.”

Joe Depelheuer, Bus. Ad. ’54:
“There is no doubt in my mind
that Dawson will compile a bril-
liant record at Pitt as he did at
Minnesota, Tulane, Buffalo, and
with the Michigan State Spartans.”

Bill Zeralsky, Ed. ’53: “Pitt’s on
its way to being a national power
in football. Dawson will help them
to achieve that because of his rec-
ord and recognized ability.”

Don Schimmel, Col. ’52: “Wish
I were around to see Pitt display
the power that was employed and
‘taught to the Michigan State Spar-
tans by ‘Red’ Dawson.”

Jack Davey, Col. ’53: “I would
rather have seen Capt. Hamilton
remain in the position as head
coach and Athletic Director, but he
has selected a good coach and one
who will, I hope, not be another
‘one year Casanova’.”

Harry Hicks, Bus. Ad. ’55: “It’s
my hunch he was the best man
possible for the job.”

Tom Shepard, Pre-Med. ’55:
“He’ll be one of the best coaches
Pitt has had for many years.”

George Canty, Col. .’53: “I’ve
seen what he did at Michigan
State, and from his last perform-
ance he’ll do a nice’ job at Pitt
providing Pitt retains most of its
former players.” ‘

Tony Swantner, Col. ’54: “If past

experience has anything to do
with it, I think ‘Red’ Dawson,
within two years, will lead Pitt
to a position of high esteem
throughout the nation.”

James Cunningham, Grad.: “It’s
obvious that they need someone
for the job, and the selection has
been narrowed down to a few.
Some of the people in the Athletic
Department seem to think Daw-
son’s the man for the job, so why
should we question the experts?”

Janet Sopher, Ed. ’53: “I think
he’s a fine coach, and we ought to
go far next year.”

Roy Titchworth, Med. School:
“My opinion of Dawson -has actu-
ally arisen from the same source
as most of the other students, that
being from the local papers. They

say he’s good, too.”

Paul Eckstcin, Col. ’53: “I hope
he stays longer than some of the
others. Maybe with a few breaks
we could see Pitt in the Sugar
Bowl.

Michael Pollock, Col. ’55: “A
coach is as good as his material.”

Harry Zehnder, Col. ’53: “He
should make a good coach because
he turned out a good team at
.Michigan State last year. How-
ever, I’d rather see Coach Earl
Blaik, Army.”

Sue Phillips, Ed. ’52: “He’s one
of the best.”

Jack Cully, Col. ’53: “Best offen-
sive coach in the country.”

Paul Schwartz, Col. ’52: ‘ ‘I think
he’s the one man who can ﬁnish
the excellent beginning made by
Captain Hamilton.”

these casual conversations.

There seems to be a large amount of spectator

read their offspring’s histor
books to ﬁnd out just what hap
pened and what was at stake. -

College students seem to have
a ready—made superciliousness '
for the vulgarities of politics. Al-

though few of them have ever had much to do
with the unsavoury subject, most of them seem
to have a better-than-nodding acquaintance with

Good Humor a Man Leaves

Sam Shapiro graduates in February. Sam has
lived a lively life in his‘ four years at Pitt. Leav-
ing, he probably realizes that he has developed into
an institution. ‘ ‘

Shapiro has become the personiﬁcation of pep
on campus. Pep and Sam are one and the same.
“Sure, I got" pep,” Sam will readily admit.

Sincere Sam has taken ‘his battle for a better
brand of pep from the halls of the Athletic Of-
ﬁce to the shores of Student Congress, of which

he is a member. At the latter has he been par-
ticularly vocal. E

This year’s Congress-has beencalled everything
from a do-nothing outﬁt to the best since Doc Carl-
son last won ‘em all. But no one can deny it is
one of the merriest within memory.

Last Monday at the regular Congress meeting
Sam gave what he termed his “Farewell Address.”

In it Sam stayed clear of Tuck Shop food prices,‘

brotherhood issues, and the other controversial
campus problems of the hour. Shapiro knew what
he wanted to say, and said it.

“I want to leave,” he began “thinking kindly
of all you people.” From this expression ‘of senti-
ment, ‘Sam drifted logically, magniﬁcently, into his
favorite subject, p-.e-p.

Right away the congressmen, so to speak, pep
up. ‘Their eyes gleam or narrow,- depending upon
their political aﬂiliation,‘ when Sam moves that

Wecht Disagrees _

It will do a lot for. school spirit, Sam insists,
implies, infers. Wecht, a handy man with a gavel,
disagrees. “You’re out of order,” rules the chair.
Cyril is gesturing for emphasis. His debating ex-
perience stands him in good stead. “Sitdown, Sam,”
Wecht yells, in a mild way. ,

Now it is Sam’s turn to disagree. He does. He
gets up again. “Why isn’t the motion in order?”
he inquires, politely. “Sit down, Sam,” says the
resolute Wecht, who has in the past, it is rumored,
broken men for less. '

Sam sits down, but like the setting sun, rises
once more. “A point of_iorder, Mr. Chairman,” the
solons hear him say. -‘ \

“State your point,” replies Cyril. ‘I want to
know why ‘my motion’s out of order,” persists
“That’s no" point. "of order,” replies Cyril,
“you’ll have to sit down.” " " — '

peek at Fortune or some other thigh brow maga-
zine, in order to gain stature down at the Kiwanis
or some other literary society.

We have a society in which the “rugged individ-
ualist” is almost deiﬁed but we have more sheep
per acre than the Arabians. This sheeplike con-

formity is no better exempliﬁed than in the an-

nual election shows. " ,

We go down to the polls and pick officers in

every year.

High Schoolers Fool Us

All of the education we get and all of the‘

knowledge we pick up avails us nothing. We are

at the mercy of a bunch of high school graduates.
who delight in showing us that we are really-

insipid ignoramus’s.

from selecting the candidates to electing them. We
Won’t even have to think about them.

It. is a simple matter to trace some of our in-_
difference to the colleges. Instead of breeding‘ _a.
lively awarness in the issues of the day, they in-
culate a feeling’ that current ‘issues are really
insigniﬁcant in the overall scheme of things. They

‘rarely indicate the similarity between history as
‘it was made kind as it is being made.

Instead of drilling facts or theories into us,.

they should make an attempt at constant analogy.
Education should not be limited by four walls,
a book and a bell and it should not always be a
echo of reality. .- -

Education should have aroused in all of us a‘

_ keen awareness of the importance of this year’s

presidential elections If we are going to really

function in the world of “today, we can’t' regard

life as just a burp in ‘eternity. «

During the next semester we ought to ﬁgure
out a few ways to show that this election is im-
portant to ,us. One student on the eighth floor
is already aware of its importance.

ruling. Everyone seems satisﬁed. Sam sits down.
Only a temporary setback, however, has been

Sam wants to investigate the type of spirit at

‘Pitt, contact organizations which can contribute-

to increased spirit, determine incentives in motivat-
ing pep, and ﬁnd the best‘ answer(s) to existing
problems regarding pep.

The Probing Congress

The pep-man terms this year’s Congress the
Congress of Great Investigations. (Congress has

[probed into food prices, alleged discriminatory

practices, etc.) “Let’s investigate spirit, too,” he

.concludes. What Shapiro wants is a committee to

welcome visiting teams and to greet high school
athletes. It will also, of course, look into pep
problems. . '

' If Shapiro’s plans unfold to his satisfaction, the .

old school will be in for a new pep era. It is a pity,
indeed possibly un-American, that soon-to-be-old
grad Shapiro will not be. around to witness the
fruits of his labors.

By RUSSELL FRANKE

Jules Melograne represents a good example of
an athletic scholarship tbeing’put“to good use.

This personable’ young man, besides being a
four-year star on the swimming_crew, is also an
honor student.

All this came about through Jules’ impressive

record in athletics at Connelley Vocational High

School, where he drew the attention that landed
Under the tutelage of Coach Ben
Grady, he has become a top performer. “I owe'a
lot to'Coach Grady. He took off the rough edges,”

Served in Air Force

As proof that his‘ ability is not restricted to the
swimming pool, Jules sports a high academic incli-
nation in his choice of a career’ in law. Ambition?
Well, he also works on the side.

The 24-year old honor student was a member
of the 400-yard relay team which last year in New
York walked off with the Eastern Collegiate cham-

pionshipwith a 3:39 mark. At Connelley High, Jules
collected a number of medals in both individual and
medley events, including the 220-yard free style
where he placed second in the state. '

But the span from high school to ‘college was
not a short one. Uncle Sam had his plans for the
boy, which entailed a hitch in the Air Force in the
Paciﬁc with the rank of corporal. “I was a glori-
ﬁed pfc.,” he recalls. , _

His versatility in all sports stretches into the

for both short sprints and distance competition-.
And he is an. accomplishedaccordionist, having
mixed music with‘ track, soccer, gymnastics, and
basketball in his scholastic days. » A

Undefeated Wrestling Records
Challenged By Penn State

By DON SCHURMAN
Three undefeated records go to the mats tomorrow as

Rex Peery’s wrestlers face the most impressive winning,

streak in the East at Penn State.

State, rampager of 13 consecu-
tive dual meets over a three-year
span, provide Pitt’s _undefeated
Hugh Peery, Hafbld Miller, and
Chuck Uram with their stiffest
tests of the season.

Peery, (4-0) unscored upon so‘
far, meets State’s freshman sen-
sation, Bob Homan. Although the
youngest performer on State’s
lineup, Homan in two starts has
won by lopsided scores.

Rough Night Expected

Miller (4-0) has Pan-American
champion Dick Lemyre to cope
with, and Uram (3-0-1) goes
against Donald Frey, second-place

' winner in the National Intercolle-

giates last year. In his last outing,
Frey scored a 1:23 fall.

Meanwhile, Penn State also pre-
sents portentous problems to the
rest of the Pitts. “They’re even
better than they were last year,”
praises Coach Peery. “They’re im-
proved.in every division,” he said,
“except perhaps in the heavy-
weight and 177-pound classes.”

Last year the Lions drubbed the
Panthers, 21-9. This year, they’ve
whipped eastern runnerup Lehigh,
20-5, and last week blanked Vir-
ginia, 34-0.

Six Assistants

Wait for Boss

No news is good news for Pitt’s

V six assistant football coaches.

With the announcement that
Red Dawson would be Pitt’s next
football coach, the six assistants
—Bob Timmons, Edgar Jones,
Steve Petro,-Walt Cummins, Steve
Hokuf, and Ernie Heﬁerle—have
only to take a watchful waiting at-
titude until Dawson arrives, prob-
ably tomorrow.

Captain Hamilton has recom-
mended that he retain the six but
has given Dawson a free choice in
picking his own men. ,

Some observers believe that
since the NCAA voted on limiting
spring grid drills to 20 days Daw-
son would familiarize himself
with next year’s squad by keeping
the six assistants until after spring
practice. ,

Dawson was picked as Pitt’s
coach after the Athletic Commit-
tee had screened 65 applicants.
Seven, John Michelosen, Eddie
Baker, Dawson, and four assistant
coaches, were given formal inter-
views, while several were inter-
viewed unofficially.

year’s captain i*‘Al Ciocca says,
“Ben has his best team this year.”
Regarding the Ohio State meet on
Jan. 26, Coach“ Grady says, “The
meet will be good for a shower
bath and we’ll bring along our
own soap and towels. Why, if the
Buckeyes swim their ﬁrst team

, against us, we’ll only pick up eight
points on a couple of thirds.”

What do the Bucks have?

According to Grady they have . ‘

half the Olympic teamand Yale

the other half. -

They have Bill Cleveland and
Ford Konna, two Hawaiian im-
portees, who are National _AAU
record holders. Jack Taylor and
Bill Sonna are two backstroke

'AAU record holders, while Jack

Agneau performed with the Aus-

tralian Olympic team in the last

Olympics.

Bucks Among Leaders

In diving, Coach Mike Teppe has
two National AAU champions in
Bob Cloterty and Joe Moreno.

Both boys have been showing their

stuff on television and in movie

_ news reels.

Grady ranks the Buckeyes as‘
the second best tank team in the

. United States, following Yale. .

But several Pitt swimming fol-
lowers agree with Ciocca"s sug-

gestion that,Pitt does have its best

swim team in a long time. Upsets
can occur in swimming meets just
as ‘easily as in other collegiate

‘ ts.
the Panthers have a chance. Why lspor

That’s my proposition. You can
take it for what it’s worth. After
all I have a parking ticket" and I’m
desperate.

Johnstown, Faculty Club Still   p
Among IM’s Nine Unbeaten

  
 

Intramural basketball is already past the half way mark
and nine entries still, boast perfect records. A total of '74
teams in seven leagues have been humbled at least once in

the 250 games that have been
staged thus far. The latest victim
was the Phys Eds of the Inde-
pendent League, who dropped a
34-24 decision to the Johnstown
entry Wednesday. , 4
The undefeated teams are:

Phi Gams 8-0
Johnstown 6-0
Faculty 4-0
Mixers 6-0
Phairm Sophs 5-0
Law "Fresh 2-0
S. A. Enzr. 4-0
Civil A 3-0
Ind. Engr.. 3-0

Phys Eds Lose _

Someone had to lose and Wed,-
nesday afternoon it was the Phys
Ed Club as Johnstown knocked
them from its undefeated position
in the race for the IM Champion-
ship, 34-24, at Falk School.

Both teams were slow getting
started as undefeated J ohnstown’s
all court press slowed up the P.E.
Club attack. The ﬁrstquarter re-
sulted in a total of only nine points
with J ohnstown out in front, 6-3.

Johnnies Lead at Halftime

The second quarter turned into
a-free—scoring track meet as the
P.E. Club pulled within two points‘
of the winners, but soon dropped
behind as. Cablan Azar and Ken
Wicks put Johnstown in a 21-11

 

   

halftime lead. .

In the second half J ohnstown
switched to a zone defense and
the P.E. Club used an all court
press. The press was effective
enough to stop the Johnstown fast
break. Good ball handling ena-
bled the RE. Club to cut Johns-
town’.s margin to 22-19 as the
third period ended. ‘

Szalinski Scores Nine

Roy Allen and Azar opened the
ﬁnal quarter with two quick buck-
ets for Johnstown. Allen caught
ﬁre and was all over the ﬂoor in
the ﬁnal minutes as he scored

seven important points and did a .

good job of rebounding.‘
Szalinski _was the game’s high

scorer dropping in four ﬁelders

and a foul for a ‘ninepoint total.

Faculty ‘Suffers’ Win
Pitt Faculty used up its weekly
supply of tape. and liniment and

roared to a 49-21 win over the
Physio-Chems Tuesday afternoon
at Trees Gym.

By handing the Chems their
ﬁfth straight the Faculty main-
tained undisputed‘ possession of
ﬁrst place in the . Professional
League._ , . I

Ollie Thorns, classy forward of
the Faculty led the individual
marksmen with 19 points, six more

than teammate Captain John
Meerbott. .
The victors barreled to an 18-4
lead at the end of the ﬁrst period,
and widened their margin to 27-8
at the half. _ ' " -

Among the undergraduates on anylcollege campus, you’ll ﬁnd» ’

i the tall: reaching up to the clouds. And once in a while-—in a class-

room, around a study table, or even in a bull session—-a really big
idea is born. ‘

\ ’ Big ideas come, too, from the men and women in laboratoiies,
’ business offices, shops. But often these professionals are exploring
~ apath ﬁrst glimpsed in college.

How do we know? Because of the many college people who ‘
have come into the Bell System, where big ideas and a lot of dreams
have taken their place in progress. The human voice, carried along
a wire, ﬁrst across a town, then a state, a nation, and now the world.
Music and pictures and things happening delivered into  and
hamlets all across the land by radio and television networks.

We’re always looking for the men and women who get big
ideas -— whether they’re about people, or machines, or ways of 
things. It's the only way the Bell System can keep on giving this
country the best telephone service in the world. \

Grandmother Takes Writing Course

Ambition To Learn Not Limited  

 

If you think the restless ﬁnger of ambition touches youth

alone, you’re wrong.

I

Step into 151 C1. any Monday, Wednesday, or Ifriday at

~ 2:30 p.m. and meet a 63-year-old woman who still has ambi-

tion. She sits in the first row, wait-
ing anxiously for the short-story
class to begin.

She is Mrs. Geina Adelsman, a
non-degree student, who will tell
you that she’s “realizing a life’s
ambition” because she’s learning to
write stories.

2 Looks Young

Raven-haired and unfurrowed
of brow, Mrs. Adelsman looks
much younger than her age, a fact
of which she is very proud. “Just
think,” she says, “I raised two of
my ow’ children and helped to.
raise two grandchildren.” She
hasn’t lost th.e essential vitality
needed for her chosen avocation.

Recently her story, “One of the
Thirty Six,” was recommended to
the Atlantic Monthly by Prof.
Lawrence Lee, who says Mrs.
Adelsman “has a very warm feel-
ing for human beings and has the
natural writing ability to translate
this into admirable ﬁctional sym-
bols.” The Atlantic stated that the
“story had true merit but was not
published because she is still un-
known.” _ . ‘

_ To Try Again

Undaunted by her ﬁrst experi-
ence, she is still trying harder than
ever. “I’1l make it,” she says, with

a slow smile and a sparkle in her
eyes. .“If you feel that you are
sincere in whatever you do, you’re
bound to make it.” '

Her husband is the Rev. Isador
Adelsman, cantor at Beth Shalom
Synagogue on Beacon Street. To-
gether they have traveled over the
states raising funds for Jewish
theological. seminaries. Her job
was conducting playlets and giv-
ing addresses. At the same time
they managed to raise their fam-
ily, two girls, one of whom later
became a doctor of psychology.

Came From Hungary

Mrs. Adelsman came to this
country when she was 33. Before
that she lived in Hungary where
she married. She received her ed-
ucation in Vienna and was a citi-
zen of a small Polish province in
her earlier years.
“All these years,” she says,
“I’ve had a desire to write. But
it wasn’t until my second daugh-

then it came to me that this was

my chance to do what I had always
wanted—to write. So, here I am."
Published Once

The 63-year-old mother had an
article—— “I remember Papa”—
published in the Jewish Woman’s
Outlook. Most young writers
would count this as an ach‘ieve-
ment, but she doesn’t. “It’s not
ﬁction,” she says ﬂatly, “and that’s
what I’m interested in.” So she has
vowed to learn all she can about
story writing before she leaves
Pitt next June. The way she hangs
on every word that Prof. Lee says,
you know that she means it too.

In fact, she states seriously that
the biggest thrill of her life will
come when that ﬁrst book has been
published. “Then,” she says, “1’lI
be ready to say that my life has
been complete.” She hopes to ac-
complish this by writing a novel
based on Jewish life. Just how
successful the b_ook~ will be is of
no great consequence. The im-

portant thing is “seeing her work 

in print.”

In spite of the remarkable cour-
age she has shown by returning to
school at her age, this lady feels
that she has done nothingout of the
ordinary. “Why, anyone could do
it if they wanted to,” she claims,
“ . . . that is, if they wouldn’t feel
ill at ease among these youngsters.
I, myself, have not been uncom-

fortab1e——not since the very ﬁrst,

day.”
