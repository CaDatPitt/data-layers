Purse Stolen From Secretary

  Early Tuesday In Student Union

At about 11:15 am. last Tuesday, a secretary in the Stu-
dent Union reported that her purse was stolen. a

Shortly thereafter, another secretary surprised a man
leaning over her purse in another office.

In both cases the University Police were summoned. Capt
Charles Ray, head of the force, went to investigate. He got a

good description of the
from the second secretarj .
** Since the description was simi-
lar to that given after other purse-
snatchings in the Oakland area,
Pittsburgh Police were called to
aid’ in the search. Four officers
came to answer the call and they
began to comb the Union.

Strong evidence that the man

when someone reported
ﬁnding the empty purse on the
stairs near the top of the build-
ing.

Police were stationed at the

7 exits and a building “shakedown”
i ensued. The man, however, suc-
“ cessfully eluded capture.

,_, This latest episode is only one

 of a series of petty crimes and

mane

attempted major crimes of var-
ious sorts which have been re-
ported in the Civic Center, ac-
cording to Capt. Ray.

He said that members of the
University family, including stu-
dents, faculty and oﬁice person-
nel, should -use greater caution
than they have in the past.

He suggested that purses be put
out of sight and that of offices be

locked when they are unoccupied

to discourage this type of crime.

He added that the University
Police should be called at once
in case of any crime or attempted
crime. This, Ray concluded, is
University ‘policy in case of such
an emergency.

attire.

What will it be for this year?
No one is toc sure just yet, but a
policy should be reached before
long. From all appearances and
opinions, it seems that more Ber-
mudas will be seen around the
campus.

Both Dean of Women Helen

Rush and Dean of Men Theo-
dore Biddle show leanings to-
ward a lenient policy for the
wearing of the shorts around
the campus. However, they both
have expressed the strong opin-
ion that they would not like to
see Bermudas worn in the class
room. -* ‘
-The two deans made another
thing clear. They feel that the de-
termining of such a policy for
proper apparel should be left to
student opinion and decision.

The current phase of the prob-
lem was started by a ruling hand-
ed down last week by the joint
women's Senior Courts of the past
year and next year.

The Court decided that wom-
en may dress in Bermuda shorts
in the Student Union after 7
p.m., in Bacrkenridge House at
any time, and in sorority houses
except in the dining room. S

The policy states that shorts
may “never” be worn in the Ca-
thedral or any building in which
university classes are held. Pat
Perri, chief justice of the Court,
commented that she didn’t think
the shorts should be worn in the
Union cafeteria at all.

She also explained that until

now, girls in sorority houses could

Concerning the shorts, he com-

are perfectly all right in activity
areas, suchas the Union lounges,
or in the cafeteria at lunch time.

that it would not upset him.

Steve Whittaker I was
noisy, rude, and loutish. The
only thing admirable about
him was his Van Heusen walk-

each session.

Steve Whittaker II talked
to the analyst while covering
him with a gun. During one
session, as the doctor was
staring past the muzzle of the
revolver, he noticed that Steve

« was wearing a particularly
attractive sport shirt. Further
inquiry showed it to be a

Steve Whittaker III was a

Poll Indicates Desire

F or Wider Religion
H Students Ask For Coordinated
Instead Of Combined Program

A Pitt News poll showsthat students want a stronger re-

ligious program at Pitt.

Student opinion proves conclusively that a non-sectarian
policy is not the answer to better coordinated religious ac-

tivity at the University.

The following question was asked: Do you think that

the University should have sep-

Taratc clergymen representing the
different faiths under one Ad-
ministrative head?

Tere are some’ of the opinions
of the 600 students who were in-
terviewed:

‘Kent Jarrell, Col. ’60,-—Religion
is not on the campus of the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh. We do have
religious organizations here at
Pitt but that is not enough. We
need an administrator to coor-
dinate and officiate religious acti-
vities at Pitt.

Joan Earhart, Col. ’61-—The

religious organizations that we
do have on campus perform
more social functions than re-

"ligious. .A religious coordinator
is needed to give all students the
opportunities of a better organ-
ized program, especially in the
way of counseling.‘

Bernie Fedor, Engr. ’57——-You

_i

want to know what I think? I *

think everyone is all wet!

Joseph Dybell, Engr. "58,--The
activities of these extra-curricular
programs should be coordinated
with the University and I think
made mandatory.

Dick Mattern, Col. ’59—The
religious problem on campus is
quite complex. I feel that the
chaplain is deﬁnitely overbur-
dened with activities. A solu-

““ti0n is needed but not a hasty
one.

Randy Marlier, Col. ’59;—I be- ‘

lieve the present duties of the
Chaplain should be divided into
two separate divisions. One,
clearly _administrative as coor-
dinator of religious activities on
campus and the second as Dean of
the Chapel concerned solely with
functions within the Heinz Chap-
el. ~.

Gloria Kohl Wilkins, Ed. ’58,—-
I believe that an administrative
head is deﬁnitely needed to co-
ordinate religious activity. I also
think that it is a deﬁciency on the
part of the University not to offi-
ciate the religious groups on
’campus.

Mary Doreza, Col. "61—I think
they should have separate min-
isters for the major faiths. It

feeling with their religion. .
Lynn Tilman, Col. ’58,——Chap-
lain Luccock can't represent

there should be ministers repre-
senting diﬁerent denominations.

A good literate humor magazine can be an excellent
“influence on a University campus.

Past humor magazines have had continual tr-ouble either‘
with immaturity as was true of the Panther or colorless arti-

The new magazine stresses the satirical aspect of situa-
tions. In alarge, dynamic ‘University, many features appear

‘Better to have these outbursts in public than in private.
The editors of the new publications have attempted to con-
tribute to the,University a real ﬁtting magazine, one which‘
the individual student may regard as representing him per-
sonally. . '

The magazine will appear at a‘ very. appropriate time
of year. It will be published at the traditional University
time for run and good humor, Spring Carnival. The publica-
tion will be related to this annual event as an elaborate
spring carnival program with some embellishments. ,

For the opponents of a general magazine on the basis
of too “much off-color information appearing in print, it
might be truthfully stated that the approved scripts of a

‘ good many Spring Carnival Shows could never be published

in a magazine.

The article in the new humor magazine will be literary
in style, satiric in tone, humorous, and fun—loving.

The edition will provide a real service to Carnival goers
with the summaries of the various shows, and map indicat-
ing location of booths and shows.

The original cartooning, art work, and photos are sure
to be entertaining to he college men and women whose
humor is typiﬁed, " ’

The permanence of such a magazine can only be deter-
mined by the reception afforded the ﬁrst attempt. It may
certainly be hoped that a University of this scope will con-
tinue to publish a magazine of humor, satire and quality.

Birth And Death 0fsA Phony;::

Rumors Unlimited

By Jim Marine

Several weeks before Tap Day, an unblessed
event occurred at Pitt. Assistant Chancellor Peake

dropped the remark that Tap Day

ened up as a ceremony and present with more dig-

iiity.

This spark was the birth of a rumor. A rumor

which was destined to grow fat
and popular in the next few
weeks until none of its original
proportipns or characteristics re-
mained unchanged.

When presented with the
rumor for conﬁrmation Peake
denied the fact that he had any
intention of doing“ away with
the traditional honoring of those
who have participated signif-
icantly in University activities. '

He admitted that he was dis-

satisﬁed with the ceremony last year which seem-
ed to drag with an unnecessary amount of pomp

. , . . o \
and circumstance and ritualistic

‘observation was by no means unique to Peake.
He expressed a desire to meet with the com-
mittee and review the ceremony with an eye to
some modiﬁcation and ordering of the ceremonies.
So the rumor had only a temporary setback.
With the announcement that the Tap Day ex-

ercises would be held during the

hour and in the undersized? Schenley Ballroom,‘ the
phony reached full size. Tap Day was deﬁnitely

on the way out.

De-emphasis of such ‘a tradition gave birth to
a set of offspring which condemned the adminis-
tration for building academic festivals and tearing

down all others.

Open To The Public . . .

An Inside J

By Millard Amdur

A definite problem exists on
Pitt’s campus with its lurking
petty thieves. These people fre-
quent civic centers and public in-
stitutions in many cities.’

The criminals may come from
the fringe area in this vicinity or
merely _‘‘work’’ i
here and live
elsewhere. This
is unimportant.
What is perti-
nent is that
everyone must
be aware of the
problem and
not tempt the
thief by making
conditions ideal
for him.

The cases of one purse stolen
and another attempted robbery
last Tuesday are not isolated.
Whether or not they are reported,
incidents of this type occur often
in a University of this size. ,

As the University expands, the
problem may be further aggra-
vated.

Another reported theft resulted
in the near-apprehension of the
robber by the student-attendant
at the Student Union desk at the
time. The man had the audacity
to come down the stairs carrying
the purse he had snatched. He ﬂed,
dropping the purse he had stolen,
after the money was hastily re-
moved.

There have been numerous
other cases of clothing robberies.-
Two weeks ago, a raincoat was
taken from behind the Student
Union desk. a ROTC cap. and tie
were stolen from the Publications
Cloakroom.

Each student, regardless of the
very natural tendency to be care-
less about personal property and
well-being, must be especially
careful to protect what» he values.

Women students, who must re-
main in University Buildingss late
in the evening, should not re-
main aldﬁe. Nor should they leave
the buildings unescorted.

The University Poilce Force
cannot be expected to maintain
an armed guard around the clock
and campus.

 

 

 

, Some

could be tight-

interesting
speeches by Peake and the Chancellor about ‘Te-
ducing time off from classes to eliminate as,many
extracurricular parties as possible. ‘
Finally the time came for this forgery to meet
its just end. Like all bad characters it was gunned
down without ceremony or consideration.
‘During a routine _meeting with students held
by the Chancellor, the question 'was raised about
the dubious rate of Tap Day. .
Peake answered for ‘the Chancellor that no free
time was being given away but both he and the
Chancellor were willing to listen to any plea in
favor of extensions of time or relocation of activ-
ity that the student committee would care to make.
The committee has not as yet broughtiits 0359
for survival of Tap Day before any administrator.-

Not until the renewed and inspiring Tap Day
program was ﬁnally held did the lie die. ‘

At last a program which has for years been

and disorganized was rehearsed

and fairly concise. Of course, many points will still
have to be cut shorter.

ODK, for example, in presenting its awardee
for the year did not have to introduce the man to
introduce the man. In this case the men were out-
shined by a group less experienced in this ‘star
of the year’ business. ,

But this is not a critique of Tap Day. It is a case

Job

Often, descriptions given by
frightened victims or witnesses to
robberies are vague or completely
incorrect. Even assumingiproper
identiﬁcation it is impossible for
anyone to detect offenders other
thanin the act of robbery.

If anyone, as a prank or what-
ever, could remove the -200 pound
panther from its lair on the eighth
ﬂoor undetected, it shouldn’t be
too difficult for any accomplished
thief to snatch almost anything.

Students at Pitt do have a prob-
lem in that proper locker facilities
are only available on a ﬁrst-dome,

LETTER

Enrron ‘     .  

Editor, The Pitt News:

The recent editorial stand taken
by the Pitt News on the spring
conference of the Student Council
of Religious Organizations is to be
commended for its crediting of
the conference to SCRO and not
to any speciﬁc religious affilia-
tion. It is ironic, however, that
the Roman Catholic faith is serv-
ing as the vanguard of this year’s
sessions. The Roman Catholic so-
ciety on campus has been the one
organization which has done the
most to contribute to disharmony
and confusion among the student
body. ‘

Late last year this group sent
circulars to Catholic students
“warning” them of campus or-
ganizations to avoid. Among these
organizations was the YM—YWCA.
How can this group discourage
the Catholics from participating
in inter-faith discussion and then
expect other faiths to respect th
Catholic viewpoint? ’

The problem does not lie in the

, philosophy of the Catholic Church.

It lies, instead, in the short—sight-
ed leaders of the local Catholic
club. Although the prime objec-
tive of this religious organization

ﬁce to operate in somewhat a democratic manner,
contrary to popular belief.

Above all it proves that a grain of salt is al-
ways welcome in hearsay soup-

ﬁrst-served basis to a small. por-
tion of the student body.

Even then, a student has no
guarantee of protection.,

We do, however, have attended»-'

checking facilities for coats and
briefcases, which are available
free of charge to every Pitt stu
dent. «

A proper combination of discre-
tion, careful report of offences
quickly to University Police, and,
most of all, an increased aware-
ness of a very serious problem
should help minimize such event-
ualities in the future,

T0 THE

should be the intelligent promo-
tion of’ Catholic thought, this
group serves a small clique with
an ‘appealing program of social
events. A

Perhaps if thelocal club can-
not accomplish a greater purpose,

it will be necessary for the hier-
archy of the Catholic Church to

protect its good name.

Government Gave Them

University Stores Microfilm

On Government Information
By ROSALIE GLAND

A previously behind-the-scenes-division of the University
’ library is the Document’s Library, which is now providing
direct contact between the library and the public.

Miss Glenora Edwards, new head of, this department,

has initiated a new area of

erence. 6

Receives Documents
As a government depository li-
brary since 19l0, Pitt receives 90

per cent of all government docu-.

ments as well as microprints of all
non-depository items. This service
is given free of charge by the
government as a means of dis-
seminating information.

A government document in-
cludes any publication printed
or authorized by the federal
government. The latter are
sometimes published by private
companies but are subsidized.

The University has over 58,000
volumes of documents, dating
from as early as 1774.

“These documents cover every
subject under the sun,” Miss Ed-
wards claims. “A student couldn’t
possibly choose a topic about
which the government has noth-
ing published.” ,

Examples of subject. material
contained in these documents are
all congressional hearings, census
reports, the Congressional Record,
federal grants, maps, and annual
reports of all government depart-
ments, agencies, and bureaus.

War Reviewed

The government has published a
history of World War II with all
campaigns written by military his-
torians. It is supplemented by-pic-
torial military histories.

This year is the 100th anni-
versary of Theodore Roosevelt’s
birth. So far the library has re-
ceived two pamphlets in this
category.

Foreign releases are another
valuable type of document. A col-
lection used widely at the Uni-
versity is the Chinese Press re-
leases, a monitoring of the Hong
Kong and Chinese Press, received
by Dr. James Liu through the
American Embassy.

Pitt also has the distinction of
being one of the few ‘libraries in
the country where copies of Con-
gressional bills and resolutions
can be secured.

The Documents Library is
housed in three rooms on the
third ﬂoor. One room consists of

i only Congressional hearings and

reports of the Senate and House
since the 80th Congress. The
others have documents arranged
alphabetically by subject matter,
with one specializing in’ govern-
ment periodicals.
Documents Not Listed

The Documents’ Reference desk
is located in the Reference Li-
brary, ﬁfth floor, C1. A5 a rule

service, the Documents Ref-

documents are not listed in the
main card catalogue. “
Because of a different tech-
nique of classiﬁcation, a month-
ly catalogue issued by the Su-
perintendent of Documents must
be used.

Students may submit call slips
or contact any reference librarian
personally. The service is imme-
diate. The Documents Library re-
ceives from 30 to 50 documents a
day from the government. These
are available for use within two
days of receipt.

“New material more recent than
the index shows is always coming
in,” says Miss Edwards. “If we
know a student’s topic, we will
be glad to set this material aside
for him.”

SWEENEY’ IN THE TREES

Spring is here—the season of tree—sitting contests. This I ap-
plaud. Tree-sitting is healthful and jolly and as American as
apple pie. Also it keeps you off the streets.

Tree-sit-ting is not, however, without its hazards.- Take, for
example, the dread and chilling case of l\lanuel Sigafoos and
Ed Sweeney, both sophomores at the Nashville College of Folk
Music and Woodworking, and both madly in love with a beau-
tiful alto named Ursula Thing, who won their hearts singing
that ﬁne old folk song, I Stranglcd M 1/ True Love with Her Own
Yellow Braids, and I ’ll Never Eat Her Sorghum A ny More.

Both Manuel and Ed pressed Ursula to go steady, but she
could not choose between them, and ﬁnally it was decided that
the boys would have a tree-sitting contest, and Ursula would
belong to the victor. So Manuel and Ed clambered up adjoin-
ing aspens, taking with them the Tollovving necessaries: food,
clothing, bedding, reading matter, and-—most essential of all-
plenty of Marlboro Cigarettes.

.We who live on the ground know how much you get to like
with a Marlboro. Think how much more important they must
be to the lonely tiree-dweller,-how much more welcome their
ﬁne, mild tobacco; how much more gratifying their f rec-dra wing
ﬁlters; how much more comforting their sturdy, crushproof
ﬂip—top box. Climb a tree and see for yourselves.

  

Well supplied with Marlboros, our heroes began their tree-
sitting contest——Manuel with good heart, Ed with evil cunning.
The shocking fact is that crafty Ed, all unbeknownst to Manuel,
was one of three identical triplets. Each night while Manuel
dozed on his bough, one of Ed’s brotl1ers—Fred or Jed—would

sneak up the tree and replace him. “How can I lose?” said Ed '

with a ﬁendish giggle to his brother Fred or Jed.

But Ed had a big surprise coming. For Manuel, though
he did not know it himself, was a druid! He had been abandoned
as an infant at the hut,.of a poor and humble woodcutter named
Cornelius Whitney Sigafoos III, who had raised the child as
his own. So when Manuel got into the tree, he found much to
his surprise that he had never in all his life felt so at home
and happy. He had absolutely no intention of ever leaving.

After seven or eight years Ed and his brothers wearied of the
contest and conceded. Ursula Thing came to Manuel’s tree
and cried, “I am yours! Come down and pin me.”

But Manuel declined. Instead he asked Ursula to join him
in the tree. This she could not do, being subject to mopery
(a morbid allergy to woodpeckers), so she ended up with Ed
after all.

Only she made a mistake-—a very natural mistake. It was
Jed, not Ed, with whom she ended up. ‘

Ed, heartbroken at being tricked by his own brother, took’ 7

up metallurgy to forget.

Crime does not pay.

Set For Opposition
After Short Delay

Coach Bud ‘Gaskill has been
forced to change the schedule of
his freshman golf squad due to a
recent development. The WPIAL
is using the Wildwood course for
so the Panther
linksmen will not be permitted to
meet any high school teams at
this site due to various high school
rules.

. Among the teams Gaskill has in
mind for his
yearlings in-
clude S h a d y-
side Academy,
Kiski, Califor-
n i a S t a t e
Teachers, and
Indiana S t a t e
Teachers.

“So far it
looks like I
have the nu-
cleus of a good '
team and it should win its share 0
matches,” voiced Gaskill after the
members of this season’s squad
had turned in their cards follow-
ing 36 holes of qualifying play.

The number one position will
be manned by John Jamison. He
comes from a family that is well
known for its golﬁng ability in
the Greensburg area and also
was a member of the Greens-
burg High golf team. ..“He has
been breaking 80 quite consist-
ently in recent rounds," said

Gaskill. g ‘ .

Alderdice High’s Harold Glick
will probably hold down the sec-
ond slot for the Panthers. Glick
has played in the state champion-
ships several times and scores be-
tween 78 and 82.

Larry Haggerty plays in the
number three positiorr for the
Gaskillmen. Haggerty is the long-
est hitter of the three, but has
yet to break .80 this season. He
was the captain of the South Hills

six men who will be trying to
oust either Haley or Sepsi at the
left-half position. Among this
group are Marty Baracca, Frank
Boggs, Andy Kasic, Bob LaRue,
Pat Marsillo, and Ray Tarasi.
‘The position of right-halfback
will be manned by veterans
Scisely and Plowman. They will
be supported this season by two
more lads of Petra, namely Bob
Clemens and Chuck Reinhold.

that are trying to win a job on the
varsity at this position are Jim
Cunningham and ‘Fred Cox.
Competition Keen

“Without a doubt this is the

ﬁnest collection of backs that we
have had in many seasons at Sky-
scraper U,” voiced the boss of the
backs, Fusia. H
“W'ith backﬁeld candidates
and the competition so keen for
these positions, it will be hard
to’ tell from game-to-game or
day-to—day just who will have
the edge in each slot.

In a way this is very good. Last
yearat the beginning of the sea-
son, injuries sidelined our starters
and the second’ stringers came
through in ﬁne style to keep our
winning ways alive. They did such
a ﬁne job in fact, that they re-
mained on the first team for the
rest of the season,” continued
Fusia.

' Notre Dame To Host

Speedslers Saturday
By ED KOLTISKA ‘
A weekly tune—up and overhaul will have to take place

this week if the Panther Speedsters expect to down the Fight».

ing Irish of Notre Dame on Saturday.

Although the Jungle Cats have proven stiffer competi-
tion for the Irish in the past two, they have still been unable
to break into the win column. In 1956, the Notre Dame squad

routed thelocals 82-48 while lasto

year the Irish barely squeezed by
691/3--61%. , ‘X

" Last year’s dual—meet was de-
cided in the ﬁnal event in which
Aubrey Lewis of the Irish nosed
out Panther Charley Eleflin in the
last lap of the Mile Relay.

Injuries Mount

Although the Panthers will not
have to worry about Lewis, who
is out with an injury, this year,
the mile relay team composed of
Mel Barnwell, Paul Thrash, Zin-
nerford Smith, and either Dick
Doyle or Dick Wojnar has been
having a difficult time trying to
place in tournament or dual—me.et
competition.

Injuries have been the biggest
‘burden to Coach Carl Olson. His
biggest loss is vaulter Max
Kumer who was injured in an
automobile accident last week
and spent a few days in the hos-

, pita] for observation. Kumer
was the Local’s best point-get-
ter in the ﬁeld events.

The other recent injuries are
claimed by Ron Rush with a bad
ankle and Zinnerford Smith
hobbling because of a bad knee.
Out the whole season because of
a pre—season operation is Larry
Och, one of the best shot-putters
on the Panther squad. "

King Sets Record

The only bright ray of sunshine
for Olson in the ﬁeld events is
Wes King with-the discus. King
recently broke a University re-
cord as well as placing ﬁrst in the

Penn relays against some top com-
petition with a throw of 162 feet
11 inches.

Oddly enough, the old record

also set by King was in the
P i t t—Notre Dame dual—meet,
last year, 156’-4‘ ”. King, a

castoﬂ’ from the Panther football

and basketball teams and tutor-

ed by Olson into a ﬁne competi-
tor for his .rack squad, will have
three more, opportunities to set

a new record before the season

ends.

Notre Dame will have a number
of stars willing, ready, and able
when they host the Jungle Cats
on Saturday.

Topping off the list is Joe Fore-
man, an ace in the 100 and 220
yard events. Foreman was on the

Canadian Olympic Team in 1956 '

and is exceptionally fast in the
dash.

Dale Vandenberg will run in
the 1/3-mile event and possibly
the 1/4—m‘ile. Vandenberg has
been making a name for himself
in Indiana by scoring a large
number of points for the Irish
in these two events;

In the miler, the locals will
have to contend with Dick Di-
Camillo, last year’s record setter
with a clocking of 4114.4.

Rounding out the list of out-
standing Irish is Jack Sanafran
in the high jump and broad jump.
Sanafran has hit over 22 feet
regularly in the Broad jump and
6-4 in the high jump.

Bermudas Gain
As Deans Bow

(Continued from Page 1)
stressed not in classrooms.

Biddle makes it clear that
there are no speciﬁc University
dress rules. There is only a
general understanding that con-
ventional clothing should be
worn. And in his opinion, “Ber-
mudas have become convention-
al for young people on college
campuses.”

Dean Rush expresses great con-
ﬁdence in the judgment of the
students. She repeatedly stressed
that she wants the students, and
no one else, to decide on the
standards of dress.

“Our office has never made any
rules about this,” she says. “When
a decision is made, I’ll back it
and follow it. I always have.”

The dean feels that it is not only
a matter of what is comfortable.
She thinks that it’s what would
represent the students best to
themselves and to the public.

“Vvomen have a little more
responsibility than men in so-
ciety. Society expects more
from women and feels more pro-
tective toward them.” She says
-that the policy should be based
on standards of good taste.

Miss Rush compared Bermudas
with slacks. “Women look a thous-
and per cent better in Bermudas
than in slacks. But if slacks be-
came the style, who would I be
to buck it?”

As for short shorts, Biddle says
that they aren’t acceptable. Ber-
mudas, he says, are respectable,
smart clothing, but short shorts
should be restricted to athletic
