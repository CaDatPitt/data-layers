Applications Are
Filed For Degrees

169 Apply For Graduation At
Mid-year Exercises

One hundred and sixty-nine appli-
cations for degrees at the February
graduation exercises have been ﬁled
with the undergraduate and graduate
schools of the University. This is
25 less than the number which was
registered last year at this time.

Thirty-nine degrees are reported in
the School of Education, 11 of these
bachelor of arts, 27 bachelor of
science and one bachelor of science
in Vocational Education. Thirty-ﬁve
applicants are in the College, 15 bach-
elor of arts and 20 being bachelor of
science degrees. Elev'eii'dlegre'és have
been applied for in the School of En-
gineering and two in the School of
Mines. In the School of Business Ad-
ministration nine applications for
bacl1elor’s degree have been ﬁled.

The graduate school has 78 appli-
cations, 34 being master of arts, 11
being doctor of philosophy, one doc-
tor of education, ﬁve master of
science degrees and 22 master of ed-

ucation degrees.

These ﬁgures, although not entirely
complete, show that this year’s ﬁrst
semester graduation class will be
slightly smaller than that of last
year. Certain schools, however, show
an increase, such as the School of
Engineering in which the number of
applications are double, last year’s
corresponding event have been regis-
tered. ;

Present Monetary Policy
Lauded By Bervard Nichols

Editor Of Business Review

Addresses Inquiry Club On

Roosevelt’s Financial Program

 

The federal administration with its present monetary policy has
the full support of at least one editor in this country, according to
Bervard Nichols, editor of the Business Review, who addressed the
Inquiry forum VVednesday on Roosevelt ’s ﬁnancial program.

Praising the administration ’s action in remaining’ elf the gold

standard, Mr. Nichols said:

“Prices went up in England after its

abandonment of the gold standard in 1931, but kept going down in

France, the only country in Europa:

still holding on to its old policy. I
am pleased by the results following
our action in adopting a new monetary
program.”

Mr. Nichols went on to explain that
rvalue of money and not price should
be considered in ﬁnancial planning.
“Gold ﬂees the country after any
change in its value,” the editor said.
“Its price remains the same but the
value is lowered during a depression,
greatly increasing the indebtedness
of people owing money."

Explaining that the small gold
supply of four billion in the treasury
is not enough to balance the forty-
ﬁve billion in print, Mr_ Nichols con-
cluded, “The results of other coun-
tries besides our own deﬁnitely show
the absurdity of returning to the gold
standard.”

“Dad” Elliott Gives Final
Campus Address Today

his ﬁnal appearance to campus groups
this afternoon at 12:30 o’clock at the
Pitkin club luncheon in Shadyside
Presbyterian church,

W. W. Mendenhall, executive secre-
tary of the YMCA, says of him: “He
has a way of speaking and a sincerity
about him that grip the fellows and
hold their attention from start to ﬁn-
ish.” He urges that many students
attend the luncheon.

Of Alum i Record
__;_.

Succeeds C.  “Starrett; Was
Head Of Atliletic Publicity
Here For Four Years
By Bernard Fleming ’

Don F. Saunders, C29, will be the
editor of the Pittsburgh Record in
its new function as the official publi-
cation of the General Alumni associa-
tion of the Unixieisity. He succeeds
C. V. Starrett riowi: associate director
for the Buhl Foun y_’,tion. The appoint-
ment was announc "d -by John W. Hal-

lock, secretary of ithe association.

Mr. Saunders wigs director of pub-
licity for the department of athletics
from 1927 to 1930;? when he left his

position to aid in the management of

of his father’s business in Sterling, Illi-
nois. At Sterling l,1e was secretary of
the chamber of commerce, which po-
sition he has just resigned.

Commenting on ghis new work and
future plans Sauniers said. “We are
going to try to br%\g the alumni into
a closer relations, ip with the Uni-
versity by giving them a publication
devoted to the University, its work,
and the work of the Alumni associa-
tion. The Record will be issued ﬁve
times a year.

“I will try to keep the high stand-
ard of typography and the excellence
of material that the Record attained
under Mr. S-tarrett. Under his
guidance it was one of the outstand-
ing University publications in the
country. if

“The magazine will carry out the
ideals and policies of the General
Alumni association} in trying to foster
a closer relationship between the Uni-
versity, the undergraduate, and the
graduate. 

“Naturally We will be guided in the
makeup of the magazine by the de-
sires of the a1un?i?li§€‘and at present
while we feel our ﬁrst issue in Jan-
uary will be very broad in its scope
of interest, further issues will be
centered about the things the alumni
want us to print.”

Mr. Saunders is the fourth editor
of the Record since its appearance in
October, 1926, when Frederick P.
Mayer was in charge. Charles Lewis,
now director of the Buhl Foundation,
followed Mayer, and Starrett was the
third editor.

Employ Students
As Civil Service

Exam Markers

   

At noon yesterday. 300' students
were given examinations in the
Syria Mosque to . select those
most capable of doing work for
the Civil. Service bureau. Those
who qualify will be given em-
ployment correcting Civil Service
examination papers from Decem-
mer 16 to 18.

These are only a small number
of the students who will have
been given work by the University
employment bureau. Since Octo-
ber 1, the bureau, which is under
the direction of J. C‘-. Barton, has
placed a total of 960 students in
126 part and full-time jobs. The
total sum of money earned by stu-
dents during the months of Octo-
ber and November was apporoxi-
mately $4,500. Already in Decem-
ber, 500 students have been
placed in 23 positions. Accord-
ing to the estimate of Mr. Barton,
$3,700 will be earned by students
here in December alone.

 

Statistics Show

Fresh Rankings

Forty Per Cent Of Freshmen In
Top Fifth In High School

 

More than 40 per cent of the stu-
dents in the present freshman class
were in the ﬁrst ﬁfth of their high
school graduating classes, and more
than 60 per cent were in the ﬁrst two
ﬁfths, according to ﬁgures just re-
leased by J. G. Quick, registrar.

Other statistics recently compiled
by the registrar’s office show the per-
centages of students here from
Pittsburgh";“Alleghen‘y ‘county, west-
ern Pennsylvania, and the country as
a whole. From the city proper, 39.5
percent of the campus student body
is recruited from Allegheny county,
64.3 per cent from 25 western Penn-
sylvania counties, a total of 95.2 per-
cent, 4.6 percent from 42 states out-
side of Pennsylvania, and _13 per cent
from 11 foreign countries.

,According to these ﬁgures, asserted
Quick, Pitt is undoubtedly and almost
of western
Pennsylvania. -

One hundred ﬁfty high schools from

vania counties and from eastern Ohio
and West Virginia are represented by
campus students. Of these 27 are
Pittsburgh schools, 41 are from this
county exclusive of the city, and 65
are from the remaining western Penn-
sylvania counties. Ohio and West
Virginia students represent eight and
nine high schools respectively.
Final ﬁrst semester registration
ﬁgures will be available for publica-
tion next week, Quick stated. He de-
clared that they will probably show a
decrease under the year’s ﬁgures of
1932-33 of 11,622, but the ﬁnal totals
for 1933-34 will probably be as large.

 

School Heads Hear Tyson .

 

Dr. Francis D. Tyson, professor of
economics in the School of Business
Administration, will address the
council of superintendents of the
Pittsburgh public schools today at
noon. His topic will be “An Eco-
nomic Balance in Relation to Social
and Economic Problems.”

As the result of tryouts last Tues-
day, Manager Saul Shapira, C34, and
John 'l‘orrence,"C-34, were chosen to
represent the Men’s Debating asso-
ciation at the Intercollegiate Debate
forum which will take place tomorrow
evening at Penn State college.

Shapira will speak on the essential
features of the NRA, analyzing its
possibilities for future success. Tor-
rence will discuss “The Possibility of
a Return to the Doctrine of Individ-
ualism,” that is, remedies for the
economic instability other than those

of the NRA.
Penn State will also present two
speakers. Onewill deﬁne and in-

quire into the feasibility of the NRA.
The other will discuss the possibili-
ties of socialism.

Differing from the usual debate style,
the symposium will be on a non-
competitive basis. Each speaker will
speak informally, adapting his dis-
cussion to the previous speaker’s
talk. At the conclusion of the speech-
es an open forum will take place.

The Pitt representatives will leave
for State College tomorrow morning
by automobile, accompanied by Dr.
W. M, Parrish and Richard Murphy,
debate coaches.

There was a little Pitt girl (her
name is a secret) who had a new
pair of shoes which had rubbed a

'blister on her pink heel. Now the

girl had a puppy dog, too (whose
name is really Giovonni). Giovonni
took a bite out of the heel and it
grew pinker and pinker and sorer
and sorer. Vvhen the heel became
infected the young lady Went to the
health officer. The nurse looked at
the heel, then called the doctor, who,
incidentally, was substituting for Dr.
Jamison. The doctor looked at the
heel, then drew«- forth a long sharp

knife and sliced into the blister.

The blister was very sore and the
knife was very sharp.
out shot the patient’s foot, hitting the
doctor squarely and knocking her over
onto the nurse, ‘who kneltwith basin
and towels behind her. From their

“Seven Come Eleven ’ -’-- Yeah.’

Mathematics Proves Chances Of Rolling That Lucky
Number Are Slim; Watch That Next Bet Fellows

“Seven Come Eleven”—but it is
very improbable that baby will get
the new shoes.

The dancing bones have a way of
deceiving the gambler, according to
the purport of a speech by Dr. James
S. Taylor, professor of mathematics
at the University, before the Associa-
tion of Mathematics Teachers of Mid-
dle States and Maryland, Saturday
morning in convention at Haddon
hall, Atlantic ‘City, New Jersey.

Dr. Taylor, whose interest in gamb-
ling is purely mathematical, pointed
out that popular beliefs of people
who expect to make money in gamb-
ling are erroneous, and that an under-
standing of the laws of probability
would show the fallacies of the com-
mon outlook. He stated that most
people confusedly believe the proba-

bility that a tossed coin will fall
heads is one—half, and then mistakenly
conclude this to mean that foralarge
number of tosses the number of
tosses. the number of heads and the
number of tails will be approximately
equaL

Dr. Taylor’-s belief concludes that
probability values state facts con-
cerning ratios, not differences; that
is, in tossing a coin the number of
heads divided by the number of tails
will approach one as the number of
tosses grow larger. As the increase
in the number of tosses, divided by
the number of heads, approaches one-
half, the diﬁerence between the num-
ber of heads and the number of tails
does not approach zero.

All of which, means that the chances
of rolling an eleven are slim indeed.

Eminent Negro Scientist,

Adviser Guests Of YMCA

An eminent negro chemist, Dr.
George Carver, and James T. Hard-
wick, a student religious leader for
the YMCA, will be on the campus
Monday as the guests of the YMCA.

Carver is perhaps one of the most
unusual ﬁgures in the scientiﬁc world
of today. He was born a slave in a
Missouri negro cabin; kidnaped and
traded for a $300 race horse; and is
now a -Fellow in the Royal Society of
England and a scientist of interna-
tional reputation.

Today through his utilization of
the peanut into 165 distinct products,
and the sweet potato into over a hun-
dred products, this quiet negro has
become one of the foremost agricul-
tural chemists of the age.

«He has extracted from the red clay
of Alabama an array of paints and
stains, toilet powders, shoe dressing,
complexion bleaches and dental ce-
ments. No other chemist has dupli-
cated his processes.

When asked how he had made so
many discoveries, be. promptly an-
swered, “I didn’t do it. God has only
used me to reveal some of His won-
derful providences.”

Dr. Carver will speak to a combined
group of the YW-YMCA on Monday
afternoon at 4 o’clock at the Faculty
club rooms in Hotel Schenley,

Mr. Hardwick will meet with the
personal discussion group in Room 1,
at the YMCA hut on Monday at 12:30
0"c1ock. He emphasizes personal and
Campus morality based on a vivid
sense of the reality and active pres-
ence of ‘God. His convictions and

personal practice on social questions ’

such as race and industry are chal-
lenging.

‘Mr. Hardwick is one of the out-
standing student adwisors of the
South. -He is a graduate of VPI,
where he was president of the YMCA
and captain of the football team and
an all-Southern end. He has had ex-
tensive training in various schools
throughout the country.

Chinese Room Committee
Solicits In Eastern Cities

 

$10,000 Promised By Chinese Government Fails To
Materialize; Mrs. Nellie Yot Aids

Interesting white rectangles of paper covered with Chinese ﬁgures were
the gift receipts presented a few weeks ago to each Chicago and Detroit
donor of a contribution toward the fund for the Chinese Memorial room in

the Cathedral.

Mrs. Nellie Quil Yot, treasurer of the Chinese committee, solicitor for
the contributions during her two—week campaign in Chicago and Detroit,

where she collected more than $600.%

The fund was endorsed by the Kuo
Ming Tang, the On Leong association,
the Chinese Merchants’ association,
and the Chinese Benevolence associa-
tion.

Pittsburgh donors in the $10,000
drive for the Chinese room are the
Chinese Benevolence association, R.
B. Mellon, Miss Eleanor Kelly, Mr.
and Mrs. Watson Smith, Mrs. William
Reed Thompson, and Miss Eleanor B.
Chalfant.

The president of the American
Aluminum company, Roy Arthur
Hunt, together with Mrs. Hunt, spon-
zsored a garden lecture for the beneﬁt
«of the Chinese room. The artist and
designer for the room, Teng Kwei, a
Harvard graduate and head of the de-
partment of ﬁne arts at Yen Ching
university in Peiping, addressed a
group of prominent Pittsburghers on
the occasion.

The Chinese committee for the
memorial room was originally organ-
ized in the fall of 1928 by the Chinese

Students’ club of greater Pittsburgh. 1

Mrs. Yot was the only charter mem-
ber of the club present. The group
elected Dr. C. F. Lai, a University of
Pittsburgh graduate in the chemistry
department, as chairman of the com-
mittee. The committee then commu-
nicated with Dr. C. C. Wu, who at
that time was the Chinese ambassa-
dor in Washington. Dr. Wu in turn
wrote to the minister of foreign af-
fairs in China for the sanction of _the
Chinese government in the project
of raising a $10,000 fund to be used
in the construction of the memorial
room in the Cathedral.

The committee had to receive this
official sanction as it would haVe
been too great a task for the 15 stu-
dents on the committee to raise the
money themselves. A feW Weeks
later they were notiﬁed that the Chi-
nese government would donate 310,000
for the project. Due to chaotic con-
ditions in China, the promised amount
has not as yet been received.

About two years ago John H. Tsui.
a graduate student in the University
of Pittsburgh, was elected chairman
of the committee to replace Dr. Lai
who returned to China. Most of the
work accomplished by the committee
has been done since the election of
Mr. Tsui.

The Chinese minister of ﬁnance, T.
V. Tsoong, came to the United States
last May prior to his departure for
the London conference, and the entire
Chinese committee in Pittsburgh went
to Washington, D. C., to see him in
connection with the donation prom-
ised them by the Chinese government.
In answer to their mission he replied
that it would be impossible for the
Chinese government to help them at
present, but that aid would be receiv-
ed in the near future. Mr. Tsoong
also gave a personal donation of $200
toward the fund.

Immediately after lVIr. Tsoong’s
visit in Washington, Dr. Frank W.
Lee, special envoy to the Chinese le-
gation, cabled Dr. C. C. Wu in ref-
erence to the matter of the money.
Dr. Wu cabled back the assurance
that as soon as possible the Chinese
government would attend to the
matter.

Mr. S. L. Chang, commissioner of
Chinese exhibits at the Century of
Progress in Chicago, had also written
to Dr. Wu upon the request of Mrs.
Yot during her campaign in Chicago.
At present Mrs. Yot plans to con-
tinue her campaign in New York and
Boston.

English Educator
Scorns Conflict

By lsrael Goldberg

“Modern warfare has become so
destructive that we must either abol-
ish it or allow it to destroy our civil-
ization,” declared Professor Arnold J.
Toynbee, director of research in the
Royal Institute of International Af-
fairs, London, in his address before
the social science seminar at the
Hotel Schenley Monday afternoon.

The British educator, who has
taught at Oxford and at the London
School of Economics, spoke on “Mod-
ern Civilization in the Light of the
Ancient World.” Drawing an anal-
ogy from Graeco-Roman culture, he
pointed out that contemporary civil-
ization, too, may have its breakdown
and ﬁnal demise.

“Since the World War,” Professor
Toynbee asserted, “our culture has
been featured by the almost pagan
worship of the state. Germany is
trying to make of Christianity atribal
belief and nationalism has usurped the
hold of religon.

“No institution can become per-
manent in a growing civilization,” the
speaker said. “Greek and Roman in-
sistence upon worship of the city
state brought on the decline in their
culture. Of course uniﬁcation of that
civilization was inevitable, but the
Roman system of uniﬁcation—armed
force—destroyed culture while unify-
ing it. I needn't rub in the analogy
with our world of today.”

Looking toward the future, Pro-
fessor Toynbee forecast, “The Or-
iental races may conquer us spirit-
ually as we are now conquering them
materially and penetrating their coun-
tries economically.”

Miners Dance To Music Of
Dick Gaertner’s Band
In University Club

At the slightly unconventional price
of $1.19 per couple, the School of
Mines will conduct its ﬁrst dance of
the year tonight at the_ University
club,

Herbert Fine, 34, is chairman of
the informal aﬁair, which will take
place from 9 to 1 o’clock. Dick Gaert-
ner’s radio orchestra, which has
played for innumerable campus fra-
ternity affairs here, including the
Thanksgiving formal of the College
association last week, supply the
music,

No explanation has been made for
the unusual price set, but campus
comment has voiced the opinion that
“a nefarious plot underlies it, such
as attempted tax evasion or some-
thing.” Fine has made no state-
ment.

The dance is not reserved to mem-
bers of the School of Mines. Tickets
are available in the ofﬁce of the dean
of men, in the ofﬁce of the School
of Mines on the twelfth ﬂoor of the

Proﬁts Of $2 Informal Affair
Next Friday Pledged To
Welfare Campaign

 

The booking of A1 Buhl and his Red
Peppers, the pledging of possible
proﬁts to the Student Chest Fund,
and the decision to have the aﬁair in-
formal were among the results of a.
meeting this week of the committee
for the annual Yuletide Festival
dance, The pre-Christmas event will
take place next Friday night at the
Grotto ballroom on the Northside.

Tickets for the dance, at $2 per
couple, have been on sale since Wed-
nesday. All schools in the University
are represented on the committee.
stamping the affair as the ﬁrst and
probably only all-campus dance of the
semester. It is being sponsored by
student relations committee of Stu-
dent council.

The orchestra engaged played for
the Interfraternity conference dance
last‘ month, and, according to the
comments of impartial students pres-
ent, made a highly favorable impres-
sion. Buhl, himself, is a student in
the School of Business Administra-
tion.

There will be a grand march, prob-
ably at 11 or 11:30 o’clock, stated
John Gourley, D34, dance chairman,
during which novel souvenirs will be
distributed, A sub-committee on dec-
orations is at work devising a, plan
to enliven the ballroom with Christ-
mas motifs. A clever dance program
has also been arranged for, according
to Gourley.

Dancing is scheduled from 9 until
1 o’clock.

  
  
   

On certain mountains in the Near East is a
limited collar of earth—-called in Turkish,
“Yacca.” Tobaccos grown there cost as
high as $1.00 a pound. Carefully they are
examined, leaf by leaf. Often it takes a
man a whole day to select two pounds of
certain of these ﬁne tobaccos. Lucky Strike
is the world’s biggest user of ﬁne Turkish
tobaccos. For these tender, delicate Turk-
ish lcaves are blended with choice tobaccos

That’s why Luckies taste better, smoother.

Richard B. Mellon
HE UNIVERSITY MOURNS the
passing of Richard B. Mellon, a
member of the Board of Trustees,
who died at his home on Fifth avenue
Friday. Mr. Mellon was appointed to
the Board in 1916, the same year that
he and his brother founded the Mel-
lon Institute of Industrial Research.

For several years he served as chair-
man of the Finance Committee of the
Board. Two fellowships in the School
of medicine, one in pathology valued
at $1,000, the other in medicine valued
at $1,200 bear his name as donor. A
few weeks prior to his death Mr. Mel-
lon gave $1,000 to the Scottish Room
Committee. The University has lost
a great man.

Free Press? Yes Sir!
INING UP AGAINST an oddly-
conceived “free press wailing
wall” with self—appointed martyrs of
freedom, stand editors of college pa-
pers the country over dimly reflect-
ing the righteous light of Mr, Hearst,
the gentleman who owns a few Da-
pers, and Dean Ackerman, the gen-
tleman who has turned out a few
newspapermen. In the confusing Babel
of noises raised against the NRA, the
cries of “freedom of the press,” “news-
paper integrity” and “editorial pre-
rogative” are like music to the ears
of college editors who think theirs
is a journalistic heritage of justice,
freedom and protection to the rights
of the masses. “A free press is the
last resource of democracy,” an in-
spired journalistic Nathan Hale of
today wrote, not mentioning that a
“democracy” where human rights
have been prostituted by selﬁsh in-
terest, where “liberty, equality and
fraternity” are nothing more than the
oratorical stock and trade of Fourth
of July speakers, is really no democ-
racy at all.

Perhaps Mr. Hearst and Dean Ack-
erman have good and sufficient reason
to exclaim against Federal license of
the nation’s p-ress. Perhaps the na-
tion’s press has more freedom than
it has cared to show or more nerve
than it has cared to demonstrate.
And perhaps, college editors, strug-
gling against the inevitable control
which colleges see ﬁt to exercise over
their student publications, tune their
typewriters in sympathetic vibration
with the words of Mr. Hearst and
Dean Ackerman.

ET IT IS A SAD COMMENTARY
that the same college editors who
rave and rant over Federal press
license are bound, in no uncertain
sterms, by limitations which make

Federal license of metropolitan papers

.look like mild ring-around-the-rosey.

‘Tied down by the “academic environ-

:ment" inﬂuence shown by students
-and faculty members alike, editors of
college Diapers ﬁnd themselves “on
the spot” with every issue. Although
no real, tangible Board of Censors
may exist, taboos are cold and real,
and the college editor who dares to
be progressive, who dares to take a
stand against the tenets of the sys-
tem in which his paper appears, faces
the most dangerous situations,

The lamentations of our friends for
“free press” are slightly ahead of
their time. A narrative of press
freedom since the days of John Peter
Zenger makes excellent editorial
material and many a college editor
can be as sincere and as interesting
as Mr_ Hearst. But ﬁrst we must get
a free press. Then, if any one tries
to curtail that freedom, protests and
lamentations will be in order. And
the same goes for the Rah Rah Col-
lege Herald as for the Merrysviile
Times.

Those Trolley Rates
HE SLOW, LUMBERING processes
of democratic government are
apparently at work in the activities of
the Student Council committee seek-
ing a reduction in trolley fares for
students. Two weeks ago, the com-
mittee prepared and distributed ques-
tionnaires seeking to determine sta-
tistics which would be presented to
the Pittsburgh Street Railways com-
pany. Many days have passed, many
car checks have gone from the light-
laden pockets of Pitt students, and

no word comes of any progress.
Thousands of students on the Pitt
campus and on the campuses of the
two other schools interested in the
p-roposed reductions are still going
without lunch, still walking long, un-
necessary distances, still waiting for
something to be done, Twenty car
checks a week is a tremendous bur-
den, in these times, for a college
student. While college students are
still dependent, to a great extent, on
support from family or friends, every

penny counts and the longer the pro- i

cess of compiling statistics and pre-
paring data, the harder the ordeal for
those to whom college means a great
deal and for whom education 1s a
serious business.

HERE IS A PHILOSOPHY, held by
certain people, that unless men
and women can afford to attend col-

lege they should not be allowed on
university campuses, This philosophy,
which parallels ability to pay with
ability to do, has long since been
swept into the ash cans of worthless
tradition. In a metropolitan center
such as Pittsburgh, the students who
attend Pittsburgh’s colleges are the

sons and daughters of people who
have never been wealthy, sons and
daughters of bookkeepers, bank clerks,
small business men, office employes
and factory workers. To these stu-
dents hardship at college is reality,
and ability in their professions a goal
worth walking a, mile a day or missing
a lunch. These are the students who
never attend the Junior Prom because
they never had time to learn to
dance or never had the money with
which to buy an evening gown. And
they are important, they are the
majority of students on this campus,
and they deserve every consideration.
Council’s trolley fare committee
should speed up its operations. If
there is a possible chance of rate re-
ductions, we ought to get them be-
fore Christmas. It isn't a question of
proﬁt and loss, advantage or disad-
vantage. It’s a question of how many
will come back to the campus for the
second semester and how many more
sacriﬁces they will have to make if
they want to ﬁnish their education.

 

Thoughts Toward June

ROFESSIONAL ALARMISTS point
with pride at the alarming ﬁgures
of unemployed graduates of colleges
and universities. Statistics of em-
ployed graduates of successive classes
since the crash in 1929 show an easily
traceable decline in the number of
College men and women who get
into one profession or anotlier fol-
lowing graduation. And, although not
accepting the mantles of our friends,
the sober seers, we must admit that
the outlook for the class of 1984 is,
to say the least, disturbing.

If conditions remain on a par with
those of the last three years, it isn’t
difficult to assume that seventy—ﬁve
per cent of the men and women who
receive diplomas in June will find
themselves facing next Thanksgiving
without employment and without
even the promise or hope of getting
positions. America, in .the best of
her capitalistic traditions, has always
snickered softly at the college grad-
uate. Even in the “best days” fol-
lowing the World War, no particuiar
virtue was ascribed to either univer-
sity students or university graduates.
Since the depression, in times when
even ditch-diggers ﬁnd themselves un-
employed, the attitude has been
heightened by the increasing num-
bers of white-collared educated ladies
and gentlemen who have diplomas but
no jobs.

HERE IS LITTLE FOUNDATION
to the assertion of America’s bril-
liant capitalist and proletarian that
there is over-production among the
university classes. The same social
and economic upheaval which caused
an over—abundance of truck drivers
and waitresses caused a surplus of
doctors and lawyers and teachers. And
yet, the socio-economic system which
we endure, facing a surplus of 35,000
physicians, can use these-and 35,000
more if adequate social and economic
planning were made possible. There
aren't quite enough teachers if high
schools End trade schools were built
to take care of the millions of Amer-
ica’s now semi-literate population.

The world and its problems are too
complex for the leaders whose minds
have coped with the social and
economic problems of peasant vil-
lages and small industrial urban cen-
ters. Social evolution is getting to
work and it’s a pity that, under an
inevitable reactionary leadership,
America’s educated men and women
must suffer,

Effluvia

By Saul Weisberg
T HAS ALWAYS BEIEN a great
sport of the industrial East to
brand the sporadic but ever-recurring
farm revolts of the agricultural West
as very radical and dangerous. Ever
since the 1870's when farm uprisings
were already becoming evident, the
agrarian element has listened to their
Eastern brethren shout in fear and
terror of against the wild ravings of
the West.

The banker of the East has some
reason to be afraid of the farmer.
For the farmer screams of inﬂation
and even ﬁghts for it, upon occasion.
And inﬂation rubs the ﬁnancier’s skin
the wrong way, since it means that
he, the creditor, is going to lose
money, something that no one likes
to do. At the present time, of course,
it seems that the banker should be
worrying more than ever, as Presi-
dent Roosevelt is unquestionably go-
ing to inﬁate and inflate to a very
appreciable extent.

UT, AS TO THE RADICALIS-M
of the farmer, there the ﬁnan-
cier is wrong. The farmer is not
radical or even progressive. He is
actually reactionary. He has always,
in the past, set himself against the
irresistible trends of modern econom-
ic life and demanded a return to
the system of his forefathers, a sys-
tem as outmoded as the farmers’ pleas
are futile.

For, even while the farmers in the

past sixty years have been attacking

the large corporations and concentra-
tion of wealth, huge, monopolistic cor-
porations have become a dominant
fact of our economic set up and the
concentration, of wealth has become
even more intense and dangerous. The
farmers saw with clear eyes the ten-
dency toward corporation and con-
centration, but they were never able
to ﬁnd a remedy for it, except that of
preventing it and going back to the
life of their fathers and grandfathers.
A remedy as helpless and unreason-
able as anything could possiblyybe.
HE POPULIST MOVEMENT, cul-
minating in Bryan, was perhaps
the greatest of farm movements and
a typical one. The Populists’ chief
demand was for a means of prevent-
ing and restraining the formation of
trusts. Their cries were futile, their
campaign hopeless. Their demand
set itself against the tendency inher-
ent in the captalistic system, itself,
and just could not be fulﬁlled.
1 After all, the real division in eco-

‘ nomic doctrines in the past ﬁfty years

or so has been between those who be-
lieved in large scale production, but
large scale production controlled by-
the state, and those who believed in a
society of competition and individual-
ism, unhampered and unrestrained.
The farmers essentially believe in
the latter and have always. done so.
But economic forces all direct our
growth along the lines of the former,
and those persons who realize it and
fall in step with such basic economic
trends are the ones who are really
progressive.
HE AGRICLUILTURI-ST’S FROM the
Civil Vtlar to the W'orld VVar
were not alone in their literally reac-
tionary demands. Every progressive
movement of that period, excluding
the Socialist, possessed the same
viewpoint. Vvoodrow Vvilson, per-
haps the chief exponent of Progressiv-
ism of his time, was a believer in

laissez-faire, in freedom of competi-I

tion, in economic liberty. Theodore
Roosevelt held practically the same
doctrines as Vvilson. And almost
every other statesman of the time was
of the same type.

Since the World War, however,
men have come to the conclusion that
laissez. faire is not a progressive or a
possible doctrine to swear by. Com-
petition and economic freedom must
go. The present President Roosevelt
realizes this and acts accordingly.
But the farmers have not yet given
up hope in the methods of their par-
ents. They still want individualism.
Sooner or later, they will realize the
absurdity of their beliefs. Then, per-
haps, they will join. ks they should
have in the past, the industrial work-
ers of the East, and sponsor collectiv-
ist methods of controlling the present
all powerful moneyed interests of the
country.

“Docto rs Run Mexico, ” Says
Latin - American Authority

 

“Doctors virtually run Mexico,”
stated Z. M. Allison, author, lecturer,
and authority on the Latin-American
republics, before the Tuesday after-
noon meeting of the Pre-Med club in
the activities building,

Mr. Allison pointed out the func-
tions of government that the state de-
partment of health has undertaken
in an attempt to bring Mexico up to
a higher level of healthy living, “Mex-
ico’s health department is one of the
ﬁnest in the world,” he said, “and
through its power and inﬂuence, Mex-
lco W111 become one of the outstand-
mg countries in the world. Further-
more, Mexico’s crime record was the
only one which did not increase dur-
mg the past depression.”

Mr. Allison devoted the year 1931
to an intensive study of the people of
Mexico. He visited all parts of the
republic from the deserts of the
northern states to the dense jungles
of the south, living the life of the in-
habitants, eating Mexican food, living
ina~Mexcan home, and mingling with
all classes. Having traveled exten-
sively throughout the Latin American
republics ‘by foot, boat, train, plane,
and horseback, he has seen the slow
but steady progress the Mexican doc-
tors have been making against almost
impossible conditions.

Pitt-Georgetown Cage Tilt Opens
Season; Closing Attraction Of

Fourth Annu

 

Hoya’s Giants Oppose
Veteran Panther
Floor Team

 

By Charles Ruch

The game between Georgetown and
Pitt brings together what will prob-
ably turn out to be the most for-
midable teams in the Eastern Inter-
collegiate Basketball conference this
year. While the season’s opener will
not likely ﬁnd these two aggI‘egati0I1S
at their very best, nevertheless there
is plenty of potential strength in the
Hoya and Panther lineups,

The Georgetowners will bring 3
starting ﬁve of giants, according to
announcements thus far. Four out of
the five men tower up into the air
for a distance of six feet, two inches
each, while the ﬁfth man, Corless, a
guard, looks up to his teammates from
a. height of a mere ﬁve feet six inches.
This is one year, however, when the
Panthers themselves will be no
pygmies. Ochsenhirt’s six feet three
inches tops the squad while Cribbs is
but one inch shorter. McCamant and
Charley Hughes measure very nicely
with exactly two yard sticks and Skip
Hughes leaves an inch to spare.

In Hargaden, left forward, the Hoyas
boast the second highest point getter
in the conference last season. Harga-
den topped all the basketeers in ﬁeld
goals scored but his foul shooting was
a, bit too erratic to keep him in ﬁrst
place. The starting lineup will be
composed entirely of last year’s reg-
ulars, with the exception of Corless.
The reserve strength which Coach
Mesmer has on tap can be judged
somewhat by the fact that Carolian,
a. regular last year, who played bril-
liantly against the Panthers, 1S occu-
pying the bench.

For the Panthers, a veteran ﬁve
will also take theﬂoor. Only one
principal change will be noted from
the team that saw the most service
in games last year. That change will
place Don McCamant, stalwart guard,
at the forward position vacated by
Captain Don Smith, graduated in
June. Mi.cCamant is a good ﬂoor
man and a crack shot whose possibil-
ities at the forward berth appear very
promising,

The remainder of both lineups ﬁnds
O'Connor at right forward for George-
town, Connors playing center and
Crowley at the other Hoya guard.
In addition to McCamant, Pitt’s start-
ers will be Skip Hughes at forward,
Claire Cribbs at center, and Russ
Ochsenhirt and Charley Hughe-s will
hold down the guard positions. All
these are seasoned performers who
won their spurs by capable work last
season.

The Pitt-Georgetown game will in-
augurate the second season of the
newly formed Eastern Intercollegiate
Basketball conference. Last year the
Panthers swept through to victory
with the loss of but one game. Oddly
enough, it was the Georgetowners who
inﬂicted that defeat by a one-point
margin at Washington, D. C. Needless
to say, the Carlson cohorts are out
to make amends for the sole blot up-
on their last year’s conference record.
The lineup:

Hargaden . . .L.F. . . . Mccamant
O’Connor . . .R. F.. . . W. Hughes

Mittmen Ready
For Good Season

 

 

Orsini’s Boxers Open With
Temple January 13

With a boxing ring set up in the
varsity dressing room in the stadium
and a. squad of seventy-two mittmen
vying for positions on the varsity
and freshman teams, Coach Joe Or-
sini is really getting the season
started,

With the ﬁrst boxing meet with
Temple scheduled for January 13,
Coach Orsini has but little time to
teach his candidates the fundamentals
of boxing and punching. So far Or-
sini has been stressing physi"cal con-
dition, giving his boxers plenty of
road work and calisthentics.

The veterans of last year’s team,
mainly Jack Schricker, intercollegiate
155-pound champ, are assisting a num-
ber of new candidates in ring tech-
nique,

After only a few hours of individual
and group instruction in equilibrium.
facing the opponent, and punching,
the aspirants showed considerable
promise.

Although the starting ring perform-
ers are not yet certain, the experi-
enced men from last year’s team,
Kopp, Junge, Greene, Ames, Schricker.
Giannatti and Stoughton, will likely
sling plenty of leather in matches
with Temple, Washington and Jeffer-
son, Duquesne, Carnegie Tech and
West Virginia.

Freshman Cagers
Meet Perry High

Yearlings In Preliminary To

Georgetown Game

The Pitt freshman basketball team
will meet the Perry High school quin-
tet in a preliminary encounter to the
Pitt-Georgetown fracas. {This game
is scheduled for 7 o’clock.

This will be the ﬁrst appearance

of Coach Paul Zehfuss’s charges and
the little Panthers will be out to up
hold the honor which former yearling
teams have held with long victory
lists. This year’s aggregation will be
made up of outstanding high school
performers and their work will be
watched with interest. Ralph Fer-
guson, all-W, P. I. A, L. forward at
Scott high two years ago, and Billy
Jesko, all-city performer at South
high last season, will undoubtedly be
at the forward berths. James Taylor,
all-city center of last year, will be
at center for the {little Panthers.
At the guards will be Jim Rowe and
Ross Emerick, Swissvale luminary.
«Andy Lasky, New Castle boy, is very
{ much in the running for a guard
berth also and will likely see plenty
of service in the contest. .

Perry high will put a veteran team
on the ﬂoor.

Perry high will offer a team in-
cluding two stars from last year’s
quint, which won the title in their
section last year, but lost out in the
ﬁnals to South High. Kornick and
Di Matteo, playing their third sea-
son for Perry, were frequently men-
tioned for all—star recognition last
season. Chatam and Fleming have
seen some service before, while
Keene is beginning his ﬁrst season in
the high school big time. Seifert, who
may break into the game at guard, is
also a scholastic center in football,
and both Kornick and Di Matteo are
football performers likewise.

NBA Group Sets
Changes In Rules
For Court Game

 

Few Revisions—N one Ra.dica1—
Announced; Ten-Second Rule
Given Added Importance

Changes in the rules for the com-
ing basketball season, as set down by
the National Basketball Committee of
the United States and Canada, con-
tain nothing so radical as did the ad-
vent of the ten-second rule last year.
This rule will continue in effect this
season, making it necessary for the
attacking team to get the ball into

.the front court in a period of ten

seconds from the time it takes
possession. Once in the front court,
the attacking ﬁve cannot pass the

ball into the backcourt. The penalty
for failing to comply with these reg-
ulations will be, of course, loss of the
ball.

One change, as announced by H. H,
Salmon, chairman of the Rules Re-
vision committee, and Oswald Tower
deﬁnitely clariﬁes the ruling as to
how many times a player may re-
enter the game. Under the new rule,
a player may come into the game
twice after being removed, There fol-
lows a brief summary of the changes
in the substance of the rulings for
those who want to know the tech-
nical “whys” and “wherefors” of the
cage sport:

Rule 14, Section 12. The words,

"‘with his back to the basket,” are

deleted, making the three-second
rule apply to any player who has the
ball in his free throw lane, regard-
less of his position with respect to
the basket.

Rule 5, Section 4. A player may
re—enter the game twice.

Rule 8, Section 8 (b). VVhen the
ball is in a team’s front court fol-
lowing a jump ball, “pass from out
of bounds, throw for goal or loss of
possession of ball by opponents, only
the ﬁrst player of the ‘offensive team
who touches the ball may cause it to
go into the back court. As soon as
the ball is touched in the front court
by a second player of either team, the
right of the offensive team to cause
the ball to go into the back court
ceases until one of these four plays
has recurred.

Rule 10, Section 1, and Rule 14,
Section 12. Whenever the ball is
awarded to a team out of bounds in
its front court, the referee or um-
pire must handle the ball before it
is put into play. In the penalty fol-
lowing Rule 14, Section 12, the words
“on the side” are deleted, making it
possible to put the ball into play on
the ends of the court following viola-
tions.

Rule 14, Section 13, The following
interpretation is added: “Under Pen-
alty (b), an offensive player shall not
be deemed to have interfered with
the ball unless he touches the basket
or some part thereof.”

Rule 8, Section 5 (a). When the
game is played in quarters the ball
shall be put in play at the beginning
of the second and fourth quarters as
after any ordinary suspension of
play; that is, as p-rovided in Rule 11,
Section 3,

Rule 7, Section 3. A statement is
to be inserted cautioning ofﬁcials
about calling held ball too frequent-
ly and too quickly. On free throws
ofﬁcials will be requested not to
stand in the free throw lane or in the
free thrower’s line of vision; and not
to blow the whistle to indicate a
goal.

Rule 7, Section 9, has been rewrit-
ten and will state speciﬁcally what
foot movements are permitted when
a player has theball. The important
cha.nge is the following:

A player who is progressing when
he receives the ball may use two
count rhythm in coming to a stop or
in getting rid of the ball, the ﬁrst
count occurring: a. As he receives
the ball if one foot is in contact with
the ﬂoor at the time he receives it;
b. As the foot strikes the ﬂoor or as
both feet strike the ﬂoor simultaneous-
ly after he receives the ball if both
feet are off the floor when he re-
ceives the ball.

If he comes to a stop on the count
of one, he may pivot on either foot;
but if he uses the two counts he may
pivot only on the rear foot if one
foot is in advance of the other. If
neither foot is in advance of the
other he may lift either foot——etc., as
in the old statement. v

In the comments on the “center-
pivot play,” the references to “one
yard away” on the part of the de-
fensive player are to be omitted,

Front and back courts are to be
required on all courts to provide for
the ten-second rule. The center line
is mandatory on courts seventy-ﬁve
or more feet in length. On courts less
than seventy-ﬁve feet long, two lines
may be used, each line to be forty
feet from the farther end line, thus
making the front court forty feet
long. In no case, however, are the
lines to be inside the free throw
lines; if a court is so small that this
would happen, the free throw lines
are ‘.0 be extended to denote the
front and back courts,

Joe Orsini Seeks
Replacements In
Three Divisions

When Coach Joe Orsini trots out
his 1934 edition of the Panther boxers,
three of last year’s regulars will be
missing. Orsini must ﬁnd replace-
ments for the 125-pound class, 145-
pound class and the lightheavy weight
class, After scanning the list of candi-
dates, Joe can only bank on last
year’s members to ﬁll the gloves of
the graduated boxers,

When questioned on possible suc-
cess of the season, Coach Orsini re-
torts that he is pessimistic on the
outcome of the meets. With such
stars as Schricker, Giannatti, Junge
and Kopp back, he will have a nucleus
for a fair team. Promising boys com-
ing up from the freshman ranks in-
clude Ziegler, Ames, Stoughton,
Greene, -Cohen, Vissat, Vogel, Konick
and Strauss.

Billy Ames, Abe Konick, Fred Zieg-
ler and Pete Vissat seem to be headed
for varsity berths. Ames, a former
basketballer, will try his luck at box-
ing this winter and if ability means
anything, he ought to

clever boxers and hard hitters. Rus-
sell Vogel, Herbert Strauss and Hy-
mie Cohen show promise of develop-
ing into real stars for the Panthers.
Jack Schricker, who ‘is the present
155-pound conference champion and
captain of the mittmen, will try to
retain his crown won two years in
succession. Jimmy Giannatti, runner-
up in the conference lightweight di-
vision, will endeavor to win the title
this year. Charley Junge, the tall
and rangy 115 pounder, will be out to
wear the crown left vacant by the
clever Pete D’al1esandro, of Temple.
Kopp, after a mediocre 1933 season,
will try to avenge the defeats suf-
fered at the hands of conference op-
Joe is a greatly improved
boxer and will no doubt ﬂash winning

Health Service
Takes Important
Place At Pitt

Students’ Health Welfare Is
Checked By Department
At Falk Clinic

 

The fact that the University of
Pittsburgh desires to be not only a
source of knowledge but also a place

maintenance of the Student Health
service, now located in the new Falk
Clinic at 3605 Fifth avenue. The Stu-
dent Health service, under the direc-
tion of Dr. H, C. Carlson, has at-
tained an enviable position among
University functions and has ably
taken over the task of keeping the
student body up to the point of
highest efﬁciency.

Through the Student Health service
physical examinations are given and
these eXa.n1in.ations are followed up
with a definite health service, Accord-
ing to their physical needs, students
are taught prevention and cure and
are directed in health education and
training. Health research is also a
purpose of the Student Health service
and it is hoped that in the future the
extension of the service will reach
even former students of the Univer-
sity.

At the present time, largely through
the untiring efforts of Dr. Carlson, the
Student Health service is a very vital
part of the University, a service which
every student seeks with conﬁdence in
solving his physical problems and
building up his physical and mental
morale. Naturally, the students have
realized that complete co-operation
with the Health Service is necessary
to its success, and have come to rely
on the advice and help rendered by
Dr. Carlson and his able assistants.
Because of this co-operation and be-
cause of the manner in which the
Student Health Service has been
handled, the service has come to be
one of the ﬁnest aids in simplifying
the problems that beset the college
student.

Golden Panthers
Topple Carnegie

Cats Win Turkey-Day Game To
End Successful Season

Pitt's Golden Panthers put a smash-
ing ﬁnish to their season and gained
undisputed possession of the city col-
legiate football title as they out-
classed the Tartans from Carnegie
Tech, 16-0, before a crowd of over
40,000 on Thanksgiving Day.

After a quick kick by O’Dell had
deﬁnitely turned the tide in favor of
the Panthers, it was only a matter of
minutes until VVeisenbaugh’s run and

a series of well-executed forward
passes put the ball in position for
Quarterback Hogan to snatch a short
pass out in the ﬂat zone. From there
Hogan drove through two tacklers and
dove over the goal line for the ﬁrst
score of the day. It was, incidentally,
Hogan’s ﬁrst touchdown in collegiate
football.

In the second half Tiger Walton
caught up with Bill Spisak as the
latter essayed a run from punt forma-
tion in the shadow of his own goal-
posts and spilled the Tartan back for
a safety. VVeinstock personally con-
ducted the remaining points by plung-
ing for a score after intercepting a
forward pass in Carnegie territory.
He added the extra point after Tech’s
offside play gave him two tries.

NBCA Proposes
Basketball Code

Missouri Coach Sponsors New
Regulations For Mentors

 

 

At the 1932 meeting of the National
Basketball Coaches association in Chi-
cago, there was proposed a code for
basketball coaches. George Edwards,
of Missouri university, was the author
and the association formally adopted
Edward’s suggestions, making the fol-
lowing code ofﬁcial for the members
of the coaching body.

“I believe that basketball has an
important place in the general edu-
cational scheme and pledge myself to
co-operate with others in the ﬁeld of
education to so adminster it that its
value never will be questioned. '

“I believe that other coaches ofl
this sport are as earnest in its pro-
tection as I am, and I will do all in
my power to further their endeavors.

“I believe that my own actions
should be so regulated at all times
that I will be a credit to the pro-
fession. ‘

“I believe that the members of the
National Basketball Rules Committee
are capably expressing the rules of
the game, and I will abide by these
rules in both spirit and letter.

“I believe in the exercise of all the
patience, tolerance and diplomacy at
my command in my relations with all
players, co—workers, game ofﬁcials and
spectators.

“I believe that the proper admin-
istration of the sport offers an ef-
fective laboratory method‘ to develop,
in its adherents, high ideals of sports-
manship, qualities of co-operation,
courage, unselﬁshness and self-control,
desires for clean, healthful living and
respect for wise discipline and au-
thority.

“I believe that these admirable
characteristics, properly instilled by
me through teaching and demonstra-
tion, will have a long carryover and
will aid each one connected with the
sport to become a better citizen.

“I believe in and will support all
reasonable moves to improve athletic
conditions, to provide for adequate
equipment and to promote the wefare 1
of an increased number of partic-'
ipants.”

Carlson To Lecture On
Pi tt C a g e
System

By Robert E. Badger

Saturday morning on the Stadium
pavilion a crowd of high school and
college coaches and players that may
pass the 2,500 mark will be initiated
into the intricacies of the Carlson
system of basketball, as taught by
Dr. H. C. Carlson, head of basketball

at the University. The clinic is the
fourth of its kind to be sponsored by
Dr. Carlson and the University.

One feature of the clinic is to be a,
demonstrationof plays worked by the
teams coached by Dr. Carlson and by
Chick Davies, head basketball coach
at Duquesne University. Davies’ team
will demonstrate the type of play
featuring the ﬁxed pivot, a system
used by many professional teams, Dr.
Carlson’s team will demonstrate the
Ca1“lS0i1 System, a system used chief-
ly by college teams. The new group
of ofﬁcials recently named to handle
0011986 games in the district will be
called upon from time to time during
the demonstration to decide upon the
legality of the various plays.

I_n former years the Pitt -Clinic of-
ﬁcials used the morning session to
demonstrate the Pitt system of play
as demonstrated by Pitt players. This
year there has been a change in plans,
Every high_ school that plans to at.
ﬁend the clinic is invited to apply to

ave its basketball squad do the
demonstrating.

The Purpose of this innovation is
to give the high school coaches and
players a better opportunity to see
gust how the Pitt system is assim.
ir1‘ated_bY. actual high school players,
ihus it is hoped that the Spectators
Wil_l_get a better idea of its prac-

Greek Paintings Exhibit

 

As a continuation of the exhibition
on classical art, color reproductions of
paintings from Pompeii were put on
display for one Week, starting last
Wednesday, in the ﬁne arts library.
According to Walter R. Hovey, acting
head of the department, these eighteen
frescoes are valuable for their use
as the onlywinsights into Hellenistic
painting, outside of literature and a.
few crumbled ruins of architecture.

Kowallis Stresses Importance
Of Proper Diet For Courtmen

 

By Dr. George F. Kowallis

A good diet is of primary import-
ance to the athlete as well as the non-
athlete. Under the present existing
conditions, diet errors are apt to be
common. Such errors are undoubtedly
responsible for minor ailments as
well as some of the more serious
ones. Therefore a simple outline of
the fundamental principles underlying
the selection of a moral diet may be
of utmost value. The normal diet
should contain:

1. Adequate food units or calories
to maintain the individual under the
desired activities.

2. Adequate proteins to build and
repair body tissues.

3. Adequate fats and carbohydrates

to serve as fuel for production of en-»

GT3)’.
4. Adequate vitamins to encourage

growth of the body and to prevent
disease,

5. Adequate minerals to build and
reinforce bony structures and to reg-
ulate the acidity and alkalinity of the
internal body ﬂuids.

6. Adequate ﬂuids to preserve the
life of all tissues.

7. Adequate roughage to supply
vitamins and to regulate bowel
activity.

In order to meet the requirements
of the normal diet, the following pro-
tective foodstuffs should form the
foundation of the daily diet:

1. One quart of milk.

2. One or two eggs.

3. One tablespoonful of butter,

4. Two servings of fruits — one
should be raw,

5. Three large servings of vege-
tables (not including the potato)-
one should be green and leafy.

6. One serving of meat, ﬁsh or
fowl (two ounces).

To this list, any other reasonable

‘foodstuff may be added to satisfy the
appetite.

The day of the game the basket-
ball athlete should follow certain
routine measures which require little
training, for complete mastery. Before
the game, ﬁrst, the player should eat
his last meal at least three hours
prior to the onset of active play. The
food should be highly nutritive, easily
digested and readily assimilated. Such
a meal would appear as follows:

1. Two poached eggs or two lamb

chops or a small sirloin steak.

One or two slices of toast.

One small baked potato,

One square pad of butter.
Preserves or jam.

One cup of tea or milk.

. Water in moderate quantities
until one hour before the beginning of
the game.

Second, the basketeer should ob-
tain as much rest as possible. Ab-
solute rest for six hours and arising
only to eat would be ideal, but not
practical, because of the numerous
daily demands made upon the players.
He should rest at least two hours
after ingestion of the last meal. If
the player is unable to sleep, he
should lie quietly in bed and not toss
from side to side. The player should
be wide awake at least one hour be-
fore game time. A suitable schedule
for the average basketeer would be:

1. Last meal at 4 p. m,

2. Rest until 6:30 p. m.

3. Game at 8:30 p. m.

During the game the player should
refrain from water drinking. To
quench the thirst or to refresh one’s
self, the player may rinse the
mouth with cold water, or may
sp-onge the face with cool water and
dry thoroughly, or may carry out both
procedures. Between halves the play-
er should lie down comfortably on a
warm area and preserve the body
heat with proper clothing after the
assistants have cool-sponged and
thoroughly dried the body———particu-
larly the face. The player should be
given a moderate sized orange, the
juice of which is to be sucked slow-
ly for nourishment and for relief of
thirst,

After the game the player should
be ushered to the dressing room, per-
mitted to take his shower and to
dress in a leisurely fashion in a
quieted cheerful atmosphere.

If such a dietary regime is carried
out, results of nutritional failure will
be avoided, robust health enjoyed and
a winner developed.

Freshman Football Team
Makes Creditable Record

Coach Gougler’s Eleven Downs West Virginia, Kiski,
Wyoming Seminary; Loses To Tech Plebes

 

 

By James Nelson

The freshman football team played
31 f0111"-g&me schedule and came out
the winner in three of the contests
and the loser in one.

In its ﬁrst game of the season
Coach “Skip" Gougler’s team gained
the distinction of being the ﬁrst team
to defeat Wyoming Seminary this
year. O'Neil scored one touchdown,
and Dorsey, an end, took a pass from
Quarantello over the goal lne to
give the ‘Little Panthers a 13 to 7 vic-
tory.

In the only night game played by a
Pitt team, the West Virginia fresh-
man eleven was defeated 26 to 19. A
passing attack, Quarantello to O'Neil
was too much for the Mountaineers.

For the third game of the season
-Coach Gougler took his team up to
Saltsburg to play‘ Kiski. Trailing
Kiski by 3 points and with but two
minutes of play remaining, Quaran-
tello threw a forward pass to O’Neil,’
who shook off three Kiski tacklers
before crossing the goal to score the
winning touchrown and give the
Panthers a 6 to 3 win.

The Carnegie Tech plebes, coached
by “Hooks” Sample put a halt to the
three—game winning streak by defeat-
ing them 12 to 6. The fresh scored:
ﬁrst -on a forward. pass from Iafolla
to O’Neil, who ran 80 yards for a
touchdown. Tech scored their 12
points on an intercepted pass and on
a forward, McGee to Greene.

The success of the team was due
chieﬂy to a quartet of hard running
backs: Edward Quarantello, Frank
Iafolla, Stanley O’Neil, and Maurice}
Steele. On the line two promisingl
ends, Alex Murzyk and William Dorsey
ﬁgured in many scoring plays by tak-
ing forward passes over for touch-
downs.

Peter Aviziemis and Averill Daniel!
at the tackles, and Vincent Hanley
and James Scarfpin at the guard posi-
tions were the mainstays of the Panth-
er defense. John Treece and Ozro

Colgan took care of the center dutie-s.,

Other members of the squad who;
contributed to the success of the;
team were: Bernard McNish, George.’
Dines, Albert Bozic, and Joseph Kur-fa
jack ends; Frank Rittman, Jerome;
Rosenblatt, Henry Phillips, and Cleon'

The Purpose Of This Basketball Clinic

HE PURPOSE OF BASKETBALL CLINICS is to promote the best inter-

ests of basketball. They bring out various ideas and promote good fel-
lowship among the coaches and players. The clinics develop mutual under-
standing and respect. Basketball is a comparatively young game. The tech-
nique and universal interpretation of the rules are not as well advanced as
is the case in football. In the latter game, the oﬁ-tackle and similar plays,
are generally well known. Their execution and teaching are matters of wide
variation. Their success is ever dependent upon the mastery by individuals
of the different requisite fundamentals.

No individual has a monopoly on the knowledge of any sport. If he
exposes his ideas to others, he will give constructive help, as well as receive
help from others. If he is so narrow that he becomes secretive, his ideas
will cease to grow and will not propagate other advanced ideas.

The University of Pittsburgh is an institution of the people, and its
purpose is to promote the best interests of the public. When the idea of a
basketball clinic was advanced, as in the interests of many people, our
school was glad to sponsor the affair. Its growth has been almost spontan-
eous; out of proportion to the energy given to its promotion. People have
come from near and far, and coaches have gone home better equipped to
handle their teams and crowds. All of the district college coaches have been
invited to project their viewpoints. In this public interchange of ideas, there
has been proﬁt to all. There have been no selﬁsh motives anywhere. Ath-
letic and other equipment has been displayed only in the interests of our
visitors. The Pitt News has graciously cooperated in presenting itself as a
free program. It presents some edifying articles of lasting importance. It
can be a permanent record of a day's pleasant associations.

The cooperation of all those giving their time and energy to the success
of this affair is hereby gratefully acknowledged. Again, we hope that the
program will prove edifying and entertaining. We are receptive to new
suggestions as to its betterment. We hope, above all, that it will recreate

After slow motion plays have been

legality, fault, Z’.(lV3.llt{J.gP.S, and possi-

be used as a basis of the demonstra-

that the use of slow motion in execut-

Pitt B Team Defeated
By Midshipman Reserves

The Pitt B team did not fare as well
as did the varsity against the Navy.
Coach Edward Schult.z’s reserves
were defeated 19 to 13 o-n a frozen grid-
iron at Annapolis by the Navy B team

‘in a game on Thanksgiving day.

The team that played for Pitt was
composed of freshman and reserve
-Lootball material. O’Neil from the
freshman team took two forward
passes for appreciable gains to
put Pitt in a scoring position in the
ﬁnal minutes of the game. The op-
portunity to tie the score, or possibly
win it by a one—point margin was lost
when the ﬁnal period ended.

Olson’s Panther CrossilCountry
Team Completes Successful Season

The Pitt cross-country team recent-
ly completed a most successful sea-
son by capturing first place in the
Allegheny Mountain association meet

two weeks ago. VVagenhouser, out-
standing Panther runner, became dis-
trict champion by ﬁnishing first far

ahead of a celegbraterl field in that
meet.
In dual competition Pitt amassed

a lengthy string of victories against
one lone defeat and that by a sterling
Notre Dame outﬁt, which boasted the
Canadian Olympic champion as its
star. Successive wins over VVestmin—
ster and lvliami gave the Panthers a
ﬁne start to a great season. The Notre
Dame meet came next and while the
home lads suffered a tough loss, they
came right back the next Saturday
to swamp ‘West Virginia with a per-
fect 15-4O score.

l<‘inishing the regular season with a
23-32 win over the Carnegie Tech
'.l‘artans, Olson took a team to New
York for the National Intercollegiate
Athletic association meet on Novem-

; ber 20. Musico led the Panthers home
‘in a brilliant ﬁeld of collegiate satel-
llites by ﬁnishing twenty-ninth.

 The AMA meet the following Sat-
lurday once more found the local lads
.'in good form and Wagenhouser ran
one of the ﬁnest races of his career to
garner the coveted first place. His
work in this last trial of the season
deﬁnitely stamped VVagenhouser as
the outstanding performer on the
team.

Bill Lawrence was named honorary
captain by Olson at the close of the
season. Lawrence, along with Jim
‘Natkins, will graduate from school be-
fore next year rolls around, but the
remainder of the team will be eligible
for another season of competition in
cross—country.

The freshman squad also came in
for a share of glory by going through
an undefeated season. Meeting the
cross—country teams of local high
schools and the West Virginia fresh-
man ag;gregation, the little Panthers
had a clean record. Tost was the
star performer for the frosh.

Pitt News Reviews Glamorous Panther Grid Season
As Fourteen Players Close Football Careers At Pitt

The 1033 season of the Pitt football
team is now a thing of the past.
li‘oui'teen Panther gridders have
donned the blue and gold for the last
time, and Jock Sutherland has com-
pleted another successful year, his
tenth, as football coach at Pitt. As
we look back on the past season what
are some of the things that stand
out?

Fritlziy, September 29—Tlie 1933 ed-

the third quarter when Izzy ‘vVein-
stock drove through right tackle on
a fake reverse for six yards and a
touchdown. Outstanding for the Pan-
thers until lie was injured in the sec-
ond period was Mike Sebastian, right
halfback. Rado, hitherto unheard of
Duquesne guard, sprang into the
limelight of Eastern football with his
great play against the Panthers.
Friday, November 17—-The Golden

Panthers meet another undefeated, un-
tied football team tomorrow when
they clash with the Cornhuskers from
Nebraska University. Heralded as the
best team in the Middle VVest, the
Huskers boast in Sauer, Kilbourne and
Masterson, three strong candidates for
All-American honors.

Shedlosky to Nicksick, both reserve
halfbacks. The ball had been placed
in scoring position by a ﬁne dash
made by Heiiiie Weisenbaugh, full-
back.

Wednesday, November 29——Fourteen
Panther gridders don their uniforms
for the last time tomorrow when they
meet Carnegie Tech in their annual
battle for the city football crown.
Looming large as being a great bat-
tle is the meeting of Bunny Burzio,
of Tech, and Hartwig, of Pitt, both
candidates for All-American guard
honors. The Panthers are heavy
favorites to win tomorrow,

Thursday, November 30—The Pan-
thers today successfully defended the
city football championship they have
held for ﬁve years by defeating the
Carnegie Tech Tartans, 16 to 0.
Bobby Hogan, Pitt quarterback, scored
the ﬁrst touchdown of his varsity
career here when he took a pass from
O’Dell to score the ﬁrst Panther
touchdown in the ﬁrst quarter. The
heralded battle between Burzio and
Hartwig failed to materialize when
the former was injured in the ﬁrst
half. Howdie O’Dell was given an
ovation as seldom is accorded a foot-
ball player when he left the game in
the final quarter.

And that, my friends, spells finis to
another successful football season.

Mike Nicksick is slated to start at
left halfback, the post left vacant by
the graduation of All-American War-
ren Heller.

Saturday, September 30—On a sun-
shineﬂooded ﬁeld today a ﬁghtillg, de-
ceptive W&J team held the highly
favored Golden Panthers scoreless for
56 minutes, only to lose in the ﬁnal
four minutes of play, 9 to 0, due to
a ﬁne ﬁeld goal place-kicked by Full-
back Izzy Weinstock and to a toucli-
down scored by Howdy O’Dell. The
latter’s playing today probably cinched
him a starting berth at left half-
back.

1<‘i-iday, October G-Tomorrow the
Panthers meet their traditional rivals,
the West Virginia University Moun-
taineers. Nick Kliskey, former full-
back, is to start at left halfback for
the Panthers in tomorrow’s game.
Jock Sutherland announced Wednes-
day that Johnny Meredith was to be
acting captain tomorrow.

Saturday, October 7——-The playing of
the Panthers today at M01‘gZ111t0WI1
showed improvement, as Pitt defeated
the Mountaineers, 21 to 0. The play-
ing of Meredith for the Panthers and
of Thomas and Swisher for the West
Virginia team was especially good,

l<‘riday, October 13 Tomorrow at
the Stadium the Panthers meet their
first big test of the season when Rip
Miller's Niivy team comes to town.
Tlie Navy team is touted to be the
best in the East. The Panther lineup

Panther Punsters Beat Pitt News Scribblers In Colorful Grid Battle

 

Out-uniformed News Gridders

Stage Valiant Fight Before

Superior Panther Team Scores

Milligan, Marsh

Paulus, Lapica
Stage Battle

Perhaps it’s a little late, but after
all, we should say something about
the big Pitt News-Pitt Panther foot-
ball game played Wednesday before
Thanksgiving,

Had the News won, the accounts Of
the game would have been giV€I1 the
most, prominent place in this issue.
Perhaps the powers that be Would
have gotten out an extra.

Since the Panthers scored the most
points, 13 to 6. however, the Wordage
will be kept down to a minimum.

The News was simply
uniformed. The Panther stars were
outﬁtted in complete football togs . . .
shoulder pads. jerseys, cleats, head-
gears, etc. The News D13Y91'S_W91'e
dressed as though they were g01I1g_t0
a costume ball, with all hands having
a great chance to cop the Prize for
being the worst-dressed,

One News player, Van Orner by
name, had a football uniform. He
looked out of place among his
brethren. Brothers Paulus, Badger.
and Kenny were outﬁtted by Pitt-
pourri. And how they were out-
ﬁtted, _

The game itself was interesting to
the spectators, who crowded every
nook and cranny of the Practlce
Field, where the ﬁrst half Of the
game was played, and of the Trees
Gym Field, where the second half was
played. The ofﬁcial attendance was
7,000. About 200 attended.

Stars for the Panthers were Kramer,
Januska, Harris, Milligan, Marks,
Weigle, Kronenwetter, Marsh and
Dixon.

Bob Kramer refereed the first half
for the magaziners. He put on a
Panther uniform in the second half,
but played the better game for Kron-
enwetter’s boys in the ﬁrst half.

Jim Nelson refereed the second half
of the game and did well, according
to the News p1aY€1‘S- ,,____

The Mcliees Rocks twins, J. D. and
Lapica, and Dormont’s Kenny Were
outstanding for the News. On the
other hand maybe they were out-
sitting. They seldom were on their
feet.

The Rocks Roman played halfback
and ripped off some good gains. Ye
ed played a roving game and was at
his best on the defense,

Incidentally the Campus Scout was
conspicuous by his absence. Perhaps
he had an inkling of what was in
store for him had he played.

The Panthers scored in the ﬁrst
quarter as the result of a blocked
kick. They failed to pass their way
for the extra D0i11t.

The News scored in the second
period when Jack Tibby made a
beautiful catch of Lapica’s toss over
the goal line. The touchdown climaxed
a long drive down the ﬁeld by the
News backﬁeld. The try for extra
point via the air route was not good.

In the second half the Panther
team’s superior uniforms told. After
a sustained drive they scored a T. D.
Milligan plunged the ball over for the
thirteenth point.

Photographers from the downtown
papers were present. As usual they
snapped the beautiful co-eds and ig-
nored the football players.

All in all the game was a great suc-
cess. Everybody had a good time.
All the players are now satisﬁed that
they are embryo 0’Dells. No one was
seriously injured. The Panthers think.
they have the best intermural foot-
ball team in the University. And the
News knows that the team would
have won by at least six touchdowns
had they had uniforms. Yes, every-
body is happy.

Coach Corr Asks

For Candidates 

 

Predicts Excellent Season For
Pitt Swimmers This Year

By Patrick J. Corr

Swimming Coach.

Although the Varsity Swimming
team is not scheduled for its ﬁrst
meet until Ohio State University
comes here on February 3, 1934, the
boys have been rounding into shape
by practicing at Trees Gym pool four
times a week since the ﬁrst of Octo-
her,

We have been able to get some

out- , idea of the progress they have been

making for there have been two AAU
swimming meets held; the ﬁrst meet
was held at the Pittsburgh Natatorium
on November 2 by the Pittsburgh
Aquatic club; swimmers from the
Homestead Library, Keystone Athletic
club, Pittsburgh Athletic association,
Civic Aquatic club, Coyne AA, Wil-
lows, YMHA and YMCA competing.
Out of a possible eighteen prizes, Pitt
boys were able to capture sixteen,
and if Jack Hanna had been able to
swim, we more than likely would have
had seventeen out of the eighteen. It
was not so much the capturing of the
prizes that pleased the coaches, as
the manner in which this was accom-
plished; it was the splendid times
made in the-various events.

The second AAU meet was held at
the PAA on November 25, with all
the local swimmers competing. Pitt
boys were again able to capture seven
places out of a possible nine places
in the meet. As in the previous meet,
excellent times were turned in by the
boys in winning the various events.

There is an AAU swimming meet
scheduled for next Saturday, Decem-
ber 9, at the Keystone Athletic club,
which will enable us to determine
whether or not our team is really as
good as they have looked in the last
two meets.

I believe this year’s squad is the
largest and most versatile that has
ever represented the University, and
although it is too early to make any
deﬁnite predictions, I feel that when
we close our season next spring, we
will have completed one of the best,
if not the best, seasons in the history
of swimming at Pitt.

We can ﬁnd places for all those who
are interested. At the present time
the boys on the varsity swim in two
or three events. By conﬁning them to
one event we could allow a greater
number to compete in every meet. In
an ordinary dual swimming meet,
there are usually eight events and a
relay. That would allow you to use
as high as twenty men in one meet,
as there are two competitors from
each side in the individual events and
four in the relay.

So let all those who are interested
come up to Trees’ gym pool on Mon-
day, Tuesday or Thursday at ﬁve
o’clock or on Wednesday at seven
o'clock.

bert Timmons

By Carl Olson
Head Track and Cross-Country Coach

In track and cross-country, I feel
that the ultimate in boys’ athletics
has been reached. Granted that a
percentage of fellows are cut out
physically for certain types of ath-
letics, the vast majority of boys of
college and high school age vary con-
siderably in physical stature. In track
and cross-country, more than any
other single sports, there is a chance
for any one regardless of his size or
physique. I like to cite the instance
of Chamberlain, a Michigan State
cross-country runner, who won the
IC4A meet in 1930, and a shot putter
by the name of Torrence, who set a
new wor1d’s record in that event last
year. Chamberlain’s weight was not
an ounce over 105 pounds and Tor-
rence is a healthy lad of only 265
pounds and an all—southern tackle
from Louisiana State. Yet both these
boys were champions in their own
right. Don Gwinn, graduated from
Pitt in 1928, weighed 155 pounds but
he threw the hammer farther than
any man on record in proportion to
his weight,

In addition to being wide open to
men of any size and weight, the
track sports offer a fairly easy train-
ing arrangement. Most coaches in-
sist on an hour of conscientious work
a day. This workout may be just as
well taken alone if the boy ﬁnds it
impossible to work out with the
squad. Hence, if a boy ﬁnds himself

tied up with class work or other
duties at the time when the practice
sessions are generally held (in our
case the track house is open every
day from 1 to 6 o'clock) he can ar-
range his workouts to suit himself,
following a program set down by the
coach. This provides a form of ex-
ercise that can be made available to
any one.

Exercise is the by-word of track

and cross-country. While it is not
rough and tough exercise, it is hard
enough to build up any boy who works
conscientiously. There is nothing of
the tearing down and being bumped
about process; track and cross-country
is purely a constant building up pro-
cess of developing and conditioning
the body. Leg muscles, arm muscles,
lungs and that spirit known as the
“ﬁghting heart” are Well known
products of the track game.

Being individual in nature, running
and ﬁeld work offer a boy his hardest
type of competition, competing against
himself. How earnestly he goes at
the job of improving himself in his
chosen event almost always regulates
the success he will meet. Such train-

ing is regular and systematic and is’

a splendid thing for any growing body.
A muddled mind, worries and thoughts
of coming exams quickly vanish from
a boy as he speeds down the stretch
intent on turning in a fast half-mile,
and that relaxation is certainly a
good thing for him.

Psychology has been spread over
almost every angle of athletics. It
has been applied chieﬂy in a positive
vein of how certain things were ac-
complished. It could just as easily
be applied in a negative vein of why
the individual fails. Certain boys ap-

parently have brilliant futures in ath-
letics and fail. Lesser lights some
times go ahead to brilliant achieve-
ment. What applies in athletics also
applies in other activities. The prob-
lem then, is to know and avoid neg-
ative factors, The boy must be helped

to come out for track. Early in the
fall each year we sponsor a novice
track and ﬁeld meet, awarding medals
to the place winners and putting on
the affair in regular track style. Once
the boys fall into the habit of coming
around for practice they usually stick
it out. VVe do not drive them hard;
we’re not anxious that they reach the

‘peak of their ability right away. VVe

endeavor to have them train con-
scientiously and regularly and heed
instructions suggested for their im-
provement. It is my ﬁrm contention
that any normal boy can become ac-
complished in track and cross-country
lif he follows this system. In fact, I
will go so far as to say that I have

his freshman year, and practiced faith-

Psychoneurosis In Athletics

to help himself. He must be coached
to adapt himself to new conditions.

Psychoneurosis is the term applied

to a struggle within the individual. He
meets new demands and if he fails
to adjust himself, he proceeds to
justify himself. The athletic end
product of these psychoneuroses may
take different guises. Superﬁcially,
they may be divided into three classes,
Quitters, Clowns and Crabs. Funda-
mentally they are all the same. Their
desires are gone or wilted, their faith
is a minus quantity and they cease
conscientious efforts. They cut down
their efforts to make good and spend
most of their energy in trying to
justify their poor standing. And sadly
enough a poor excuse seems to take
on sufﬁcient signiﬁcance. We should
ﬁght to make ourselves worthy of any
challenge. We can help this process
by avoiding the following classes of
psychoneurotics.

The Quitter may have become that,
just when he was about to be a suc-
cess. He may have had all the qual-
iﬁcations of a champion but allowed
temporary hard luck to down him.
He may never have intensely desired
to be great. If he had some desire
to be good he may have lacked faith
in himself. Possibly he was not will-
ing to work. The picture of greatness
may have been clear out but he was
not willing to pay the price. Regard-
less, when new demands were made
upon him, he failed to adapt himself
and he dropped out of the picture as
a quitter. This emphasizes that a
winner never quits and a quitter sel-

.never seen a track shoe prior to their a dom wins.

The Clown may have all the

John Love

requisites of a champion except faith
in himself. He may have visualized
achievement and had great desires to
win. He was willing to work and

ﬁght and even pray, but he lacked
faith. He was able to hang on because
he had ability, but he thought that
possibly the other fellow was better.
To cover his disappointment he tried
to amuse others. With the clowning
anticscame lessened ability. This al-
lowed the other fellow to actually be-
come better. The moral is to want
to be a champion, to plan and work
and to have faith that your best ef-
forts will always get better,

The Crab is the one who wants
something, but does not have the
wholesomeness to honestly aspire for
a thing. He is directly opposite the
clown, not only in disposition but
frequently in ability. He does not
have faith in himself or anyone else.
Further he may even distrust him-
self and every one. This emotion is
reflected in his general attitude. He
does not try himself and will not
co-operate with others. He does not
have the courage to quit. He tries
to justify himself only by hanging on
and blaming his shortcomings on
others. He is the fellow who is sup-
posed to get the worst of everything.
Sadly enough, he compensates him-
self with delusions of persecution and
he might have been a winner,

Psychoneurosis may easily be
avoided in any line. Right is known
from wrong. Daily application will
generate the ability to meet any prob-
lem. The price is small but the de-
mand is regular.
yourself daily. A charted course with
persistent effort will surely bring you
to the goal. The formula is known.
Pay up daily. Win ’em all.

Indoor Activities Replace
;[ ROTC Outdoor Period

 

Beginning today and continuing un-
til March 16, all members of ROTC
will participate in indoor activities in-
stead of the weekly outdoor drill
period, according to an order from
Lieutenant-Colonel Cullen, professor
of military science and tactics. The
basic and advanced groups will meet
separately, the former at Logan ar-
mory under Lieutenant A, E. Wilson,
assistant professor, and the latter at
Carnegie lect.ure hall under Lieuten-
ant D. C. Tredennick, assistant pro-
fessor.

The advanced corps will meet in
uniform at 1 o'clock and will be given
a course in massed commands for
the ﬁrst period.

The basic corps, which will not be
required to appear in uniform, will be
shown a motion picture, “Cadet Days
at West Point.” Interested students
are invited to attend. A regular pro-
gram of motion pictures has been
planned by the department for future
basic meetings,

Pittsburgh business improved in the
ﬁrst half of October only to decline in
the latter half. Much curtailed oper-
ating schedules evinced the uncertain-
ty with which industry viewed the fu-
ture. Pittsburgh steel operations
were reduced even more in other
parts of the country; coal mining was
held up by the many prevailing
strikes; and the resulting electrical
power sales to industrial users were
marked. The gain in local retail
trade was far below the seasonal
ﬁgures.

During the ﬁrst two weeks of No-

burg business activity declined, but

that the Pitt boy is somewhat over the average of the aver-
age American boy between the ages of 16 and 19.

When all the ﬁgures have been compiled by the depart-

100,000 American soldiers examined in a like manner.

SHOOTING FROM SCRATCH, 25 yards behind the
traps, Walter Beaver pulled out of an exciting
tie to win the 34th Grand American—the ﬁrst
time it has been won by a limit contestant! He
has been a steady smoker of Camels for years,
and says: “During all these years I’ve been
smoking Camels because I like their taste
and mildness ...they never jangle my nerves.”

WALTER BEAVER, holder of the coveted

‘ ‘Winning a trap-shooting champion-

the result of practice and partly healthy
nerves. I’m a steady smoker. People
kid me about it at the tournaments.
They say I never have a cigarette out
of my mouth. During all these years
I’ve been smoking Camels, not only
