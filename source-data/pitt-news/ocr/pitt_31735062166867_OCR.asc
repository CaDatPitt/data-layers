Government
Group Tries
Reorganization

_ Monday at noon a meeting
will be held in 330 CL to reor-
Ayganize the now defunct ICG
Club. What is ICG? ICG stands
for Intercollegiate Conference
on Government. The purpose of
ICG is “to foster an interest in
.governmental problems among
the students in college and uni-
versities by dramatizing the ac-
tivities of the government in an
unbiased, nonpartisan manner.”
“The ICG was organized in
1934 by the student delegates
who attended a Model State Con-
stitutional Convention,’ which
had been held at the State Cap-
itol as the result of a professor's
query as to whether or not col-
.lege men and women of that day

could write a better State Con-

stitution thtan the one Pennsyl-
vania then had,’ and still has.
The students, and their faculty
advisers, felt that so much had
been learned from this experi-
ence as ‘model’ constitutional
convention delegates that they
-asked the organizing commit-
tee to arrange. a ‘Model State
Legislature’ for 1935,” sai-d Jay
Rubin, group organizer. The
University was a charter mem-
member of ICG.

The ICC “has sponsored year
round study programs and state-
wride meetings which frequently

A take the form of a ‘Model State
“’»»"Legislature, but have also taken

the form of a Model National
Political Convention, a Model
National Congress, a Model In-
terstate Governor's Conference,
a Model Post War Reconstruc-
tion Conference and a Model
State Constitutional Convention.
In all cases, an efﬁo-rt has been
made to simulate an actual gov-
ernment assembly insoﬂar as
possible, and to have -the stu-
dent delegates prepare, submit,
debate and act upon legislature
or other body concerned. Re-
gional meetings are also held
during each year in the ﬁve re-
gions of Pennsylvania, which
have been set up for adminis-
trative‘ purposes.”

This year the 32nd annal meet-
ing of the ICG will take the
form of a Model National Po-
litical Convention, and will be
held in Harrisburg, Pa, the
weekend of April 4-6.

Chancel1or’s (Wife Judges
Local Auditions for Met

Pittsburgh district oper-
atic singers will. soon be
singing for an opportunity
to be heard at “The Met.”

For the first time, audi-
tions for the Metropolitan
Opera will be open to the pub-
lic locally, and the judge of the
district auditions will be an op-
eratic star who has recently
taken up residence in Pitts-
burgh.

She is Mildred Miller, who is
in private life the wife of Chan-
cellor Wesley W. Pos-var.

Recipient of many accolades
and honors, Miss Miller recent-
ly awarded the Grand Prix du
Disque for her recordings of
Brahms’ “Alto Rhapsody” and
Mahler's “Songs of la.‘ Wayﬁarer.”

Featured -in the Metropolitan,
San Francisco and Vienna State
Opera Companies, Miss Miller
also has appeared in concert
with orchestra, in recital, on
television and radio, and has
made numerous recordings.

Although the Playhouse has
served as the audition site of
«previous Metropolitan Opera au-

ents, Ken Schueler of the Positive Action Team (PAT) and George

Belly proposed that functions such as Homecoming and is-
sues such as “the stupid parking problem” can be taken. care of by
organizations other than SG, such as the Student Union Board
and the Commuter Association. He said he didn't think SG “could

Candidate Schueler pointed to the removal of the $100 out-of-
state fee and the “fantastic” work of the Off-Campus Housing Com-
mittee as examples of SG effectiveness. He argued that what is
needed to further increase effectiveness is to “instill pride in the
students.” Like the tenent farmers in Steinbeck’s The Grapes of

Both partisan Student Gov-
ernment (SG) presidential can-
didates, George Doperak of the
United S t u d e n t Association
(USA) and Ken Schueler of the
Positive Action Team (PAT)
had similar reactions to inde-
pendent candidate Armand Bel-
1y’s statements printed in yes-
terday’s Pitt News.

Doperak said that Belly ex-
hibits the wrong attiutunde toward
SG while offering no solultivon
to its problems. According to
Schueler: “Armand is treating
the effect and not the cause
of the problems."

Doperak agrees with Belly to
an extent on some of his points,
but the USA candidate stres-s-ed
SG’s importance in matters out-
side of basic education. “Educa-
tion is a very important func-
tion, and it is a part -of our plat-
‘form too.” Doperak said. “But
other things should also lie un-
der SG’s jurisdiction.” He gave
Homecoming as an example...

Doperak considers B elly’s
statement a much too serious
a lash at everyone. “We may
be mediocre, but we're sincere,”
he added.

Schuler also stressed SG’s im-
portance -in all aspects of cam-
upus life. He said, “SG is the only
organization that meets «all the
student needs.” He named some
of SIG’s varied functions and
cited its role as a coordinator
of all other orgia-nizations su.-ch
at IFC and the Commuters’ As-
sociation. A

“Armand’s point of View is
limited in perspective. He should
not be concerned only with
education. Extracurricular ‘acti-
vities are just as important, and
Armand is limiting social needs
to educational needs,” said the
-PAT candidate. “He should
think of students outside of the
classroom.”

Sch-ueler concluded with: “I
say he should leave education
to the faculty and keep control
of extracurricular activities in
the students,’ hands.”

' ganization on

  

Wrath, Schuler said, students
‘‘don’t know how to ‘get to the
system” and apply pressure for
change.

USA’s Doperak labelled Bel-

ly’s Iproposal “ridiculous.” He
described SG’s role as an in-
litiator and coordinator of stu-
dent opinion as a primary rea-
son for its maintenance. Yet,
he admitted the: “right now,
we are fighting for the -life of
Student Government.”

Despite -his unique,.stand, Bel-

ly identified the quality of un-
dergraduate education as a ma-
jor issue and proposed that the
existing school cabinets, be
strengthened and divorced from
SG. “The Liberal Arts Cabinet
(a branch of SG) should per-
haps be the most important or-
campus and
should be taken out of the realm
of politics,” he said.
‘ Schueler admitted that edu-
cation was the primary issue.
His platform calls for mainten-
ance of low 2s-t—udent-faculty ra-
tios. But he added, “Social and
extracurri.cular activlities may
be secondary. Yet where a stu-
dent: lives, how ‘he lives, and
what he pays cannot be ignor-
ed.”

Doperak pointed to a USA
vplatﬁorrm plank calling ﬁor re-
view boards in each academic
department to give students a
larger say in matters of edu-
-cation. ,

At one point in the debate,
Scheuler accused Belly of rais-
ing “sideline issues that de-
tract from other important is-
sue-s—such as the representa-
tion of interests other than
those of specific interest
groups.” He doubted that smal-
ler interest groups like Men’s
Dorm Council, Associated Wom-
en Students, or -the Commuter
Association could bring as much
pressure to bear on student
problems as could SG.

Belly replied, “'Ilhe only thing
administrators understand is
:fear. Students will have to make
up their own rninds, and  they
consider an issue that impor-
tant, they should go out and
take drastic action.”

P:ge8—THE rrrr NEWS- January 18. 1968

 Campaign Commentary

   

Editorial: The

Armand Belly has posed a challenge to the two other presidential can-
didates to which thye have not asyet sufficiently responded. The extremity

_ of Belly’s stand that Student Government (SG) should be abolished cannot
-be denied, but at the same time his ideas should not be dismissed. All candi-

dates concur that SG as an organization has operated at less than maxi-
mum effectiveness, however they strongly differ on the degrees of this
“ineffectiveness.”

While Schueler and Doperak call for improvements within the same
framework within which SG now operates, Belly repudiates the entire
system. The PAT and USA candidates both have numerous proposals to
improve that status quo, whereas Be-lly contends that there's nothing
worth saving, He argues that there are existing organizations such as
Liberal Arts Cabinet that can more effectively handle what he terms the
most important issue facing us—“the-quality of undergraduate education.”

Sdhueler told The Pitt News that Belly “should think of students out-
sidefof the classroom. I say he should leave education to the faculty and
keep control of extracurricular activities in the students’ handsz” How-
ever, when confronted by Belly in the WPGH debate for all three candi-
dates Tuesday evening, he admitted that education was the primary issue.

Doperak informed The Pitt News that he agrees with Belly to an ex-
tent -on some of his points, but the USA candidate stressed SG’s impor-
tance in matters outside of basic education. “Education is a very important
function, and it is a part of our platform, too. But other things should al-
so lie under SG’s jurisdiction. In response to Belly’s statement that he

 

Initial Confrontation

(Belly) is running because of the mediocrity of his opponents, Doperak
acknowledge, “We may be mediocre, but we’re sincere.” _

In reply to Doperak’s remark, we're going to give him the benefit of
the doubt and state that his accomplishments just might disprove his‘
claim to mediocrity but sincerity. '

In evaluating the three presidential candidates thus’ far, we must
stress that while the other two candidates may beg to differ with Belly’s
contention that SG should be abolished, they have as yet to answer Belly’s
question of what function can SG perform that no other organization can.

We see the question of the structure of SG as the crux of the issue, and 9'1

feel that the debates that follow should deal wih this question.

However, we must point out that while Belly’s contention may win
the debates for him, he has failed as yet to effectively deal with the vital
question, “If not SG, what then?” His solution of Liberal Arts Cabinet
cannot begin to deal with questions outside the realm of education, such as
striving for a ten per cent discount for students in the Book Center or ral-
lying for a new Student Union. He must now present effective alternatives
if he is to honestly defend his initial assertion.

Earlier in this editorial, we related incidents where both Schueler and
D-operak mlade slips of the tongue that can be misconstrued. Unfortunate-
ly, they have allowed themselves thus far to respond to Belly, who is a
trained debator, and let him carry the ball at the expense of more firmly
asserting their own points. We urge them to change their tactics to most
effectively represent themselves.

I> The class registration process must 1

be thoroughly evaluated and revised.
1) Students must be informed within
two weeks after registering if they

Juniors and seniors should not be
dropped from a course. they have se-

Students should be allowed to add or

> The Liberal Arts Cabinet, working
with the School ‘of Arts, should
1) Re-evaluate the language require-

> To ensure the continued growth of
the University and to provide an enrich-

Belly Calls SG ‘Incompetent,’

(The following is the platform sub-
mitted to the Pitt News by Armand
Belly and Ken H oleclco, candidates for
SG President and Vice-President re-
spectively.)

Student Government is a farce.
It is a waste of time, energy, and

money. It serves no conceivable

function on the University of Pitts-‘

burgh campus, and, in fact, tends
to divert student attention from
the real problem facing them. Use-
less debate over homecoming and
ridiculous concern over juke boxes‘

We have decided to run because:

(2) Our opponents have nothing to
offer but continued incompe-
tence and mediocrity.

(2) Student Government can offer
only frustration to creative and
concerned students who wish to
improve the University.

We therefore propose:

(1) The complete abolition of Stu-

dent Government.

rather than being moved to the North

'> The University A should withdraw * 4

from the four school agreement that
limits us to one hundred football schol-
«a'rs:hipus per four years.
i> In order to meet the needs of com-
muting students, the Commuter Asso-
ciation must be recognized as a major
student organization entitled a seat on
the Chancellor's Student Affairs Advi-
sory Ciommittee and the SG President's
Council.
1) Study, eating, lounge, and locker fa-
cilities for commuters must be in-
creased immediately.

2) The feasibility of University owned
parking facilities for students must
be studied immediately. Attention
must also be given to meet an in-
creasing need for more motorcycle
parking facilities.

3) The University, cooperating with
other colleges and universities in the
area, should arrange with the Port
Au.tho~rity to provide direct bus serv-
ice to and from the campus for large
groups of students in areas which

now hav-e inadequate bus service.

.> Student Government must develop

a closer relationship between itself and ‘

each individual student and campus or-

1) Beginning this term, a SG report will
be sent to every student at least once
a term.

2) The General Assembly must be used
to allow re-preIsenta.t~ive's of every stt-

2) ‘Serve as a clearing house or record
