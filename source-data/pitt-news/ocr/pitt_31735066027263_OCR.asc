Farmer Clinton aide reveals comical details of White House life

Mellissa Blackwood

 

In his first public appearance
since leaving -the White House,
‘George Stephanopoulos defend-
ed liberalism and quoted Bruce
Springsteen to a packed house at
the William Pitt Union Assembly
Room last night.

Stephanopoulos, who
stepped down. as senior advisor
to President Clinton last week,
kept the tone light as he recount-
ed his most memorable moments
from his ﬁve and a half years at
the President’s side in a lecture
sponsored by the Pitt Program
Council.

Some of his anecdotes
included the time he found him-
self in the wrong room, holding
the President’s inaugural speech

in his hand, fifteen minutes
before Clinton was about to take
his first oath of office.

“You have never imagined
such terror as what I felt at that
moment,” he said.

After running and sliding
across the marble ﬂoors of the
Capitol, Stephanopoulos man-
aged to get the speech to Clinton
with just three minutes to spare.

“Bill Clinton’s first inaugur-
al almost didn’t happen, and it
was almost my fault,” he said.

He also told the story of
when he and Clinton spent all
morning in the oval office, prac-
ticing what would become the
historic handshake between
Clinton, Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat, and Israeli Prime
Minister Yitshak Rabin on the
White House lawn.

“The president was afraid
that Arafat would reach out and
hug him and send the wrong
message to the country,”
Stephanopoulos recalled. “So we
practiced a little elbow block,
and it worked.”

On a more serious note,
Stephanopoulos defended the
liberal policies of President
Clinton while attacking the
press.

“The media tends to tear
down almost everything without
really explaining the issues,” he
said. “It’s no secret that I didn’t
always agree with the president,
but no matter what [the press]
threw at him, his clear and com-
pelling vision of the future car-
ried him through.”

WASHINGTON, D.C.- The govern-

not earn from serving.

Federal agencies aren’t stripping
funding, but the emphasis on volunteer
programs is moving away from pecu-
niary benefits, according to govern-
ment sources.

Programs like AmeriCorps and
Learn and Serve America help thou-
sands of high school and college level
students get the credits and experience

Increasing numbers of colleges
and high schools are placing a service
requirement on their list of graduation
criteria, and to meet these require-
ments, more students are participating
in federal volunteer programs.

AmeriCorps also helps students
financially by awarding grants to help
with the rising costs of tuition. Many
volunteers are attracted to service by
these grants as a way to pay for col-

More police needed for safety, says chief

The layout and area in which Pitt is
_centered can create a number of crime

problems, according to the head of the
campus police, but a meeting last week
between students and University officials
may mean the start of some new safety
procedures.

Pitt Police Chief Rick Boyd fielded
questions about the campus, the police
force, and the possibility of new security
measures at the Campus Pedestrian
Safety Forum last Thursday night.

Boyd has consistently stated that
Pitt’s campus is a safe place in which to
live and work, but the urban setting cre-
ates dangers that do not face other univer-
sities.

Joe Cavalla, director of student activ-
ities, asked whether security cameras on
campus would make the area safer for
students and Pitt employees.

But Boyd said cameras can create
more problems than they solve due to
vandalism and the inability of a camera to
do anything to prevent a crime.

“I would just as soon not get into
cameras,” Boyd said. “You get into prob-
lems of having cameras break or people
hired to watch the cameras not doing their
jobs. To me, cameras give a false sense of

- sprawling size of the campus, and the

security.”

Yet while Boyd dismissed cameras,
he discussed a new security program
being installed on smaller campuses
across the country.

On these campuses, all students, fac-
ulty, and staff are issued a personal secu-
rity device. A person in need of the police
pushes the button found on the device and
a radio signal is sent to a central facility.
An alarm will sound at a location nearest
the individual, and police are dispatched
immediately to the scene.

However, the surrounding hills, the

large student body make this a nearly
impossible task to accomplish at Pitt,
according to Boyd.

He emphasized that such a plan
would cost a great deal and that this cost
would be passed on to the students.
Instead, he said it was best to concentrate
on increased police patrols.

There are speciﬁc beats assigned to
the Sutherland/fratemity complex area,
Schenley Quad, Lothrop and Victoria
Halls, Forbes and Fifth Avenues, David
Lawrence Hall and Hillman Library, and
the Cathedral of Learning. The Cathedral
beat also includes Crawford, Langley, and
Clapp Halls.

These patrols occur virtually 24

Bankers acquitted on Whitewater

Across the Nation

LITTLE ROCK — Two bankers acquit-

ted on Whitewater—relatcd charges last year-

will have to pay contempt—of—cou1t ﬁnes,
said U.S. District Judge Stephen Reasoner.
Herby Branscum, Jr. and Robert M. Hill
were ﬁned $1,000 per day (for 77 days) for
not complying with subpoenas when they
refused to turn over documents involving
improper donations to the gubernatorial and
presidential campaigns of Bill Clinton.

The judge refused their requests to
have the fines refunded because he said
they had plenty of time to answer the sub-
poenas before the ﬁnes were imposed. The
two werc acquitted of conspiring to conceal
$52,500 in withdrawals by Clinton’s 1990
gubernatorial and 1992 presidential cam-
paigns. Associated Press

NEW YORK — The Garnbino crime fam-
ily has been infiltrated by an FBI agent who
uncovered a $6 million scheme to sell com-
puters, VCRs, feather beds, and foot mas-
sagers that were stolen in truck hijackings.
FBI Assistant Director J arncs K. Kallstrom
said that in one robbery, the suspects took
about $1 million in designer dresses.

“The rule is: if it had value, they stole
it,” he said.

Forty-seven people have been charged
with extortion, racketeering, trafﬁcking in
stolen property, drug sales, and gun charges.
The arrests are the result of a three-year

Around the World

LONDON — British researchers claim
that the risk of Alzheimer’s disease may be
increased with the presence of the same
virus that causes cold sores. Ifthis ﬁnding is
conﬁrmed, it may be possible to reduce the
risk of Alzheimer’s disease by suppressing
the herpes simplex virus with medication.
The herpes simplex virus causes a cold sore
by infecting the skin and then works itself
into the nerves of the face, where it remains
for life. It is estimated that between 50 and
90 percent of the population is infected with
the virus. Associated Press "

LONDON —— A new dinosaur species was

Geology, said the new species is 120 rnil- .

lion years old and was a carnivore that fed
on small animals. It will be displayed in a

WASHINGTON D.C.--Inside the
crammed bus racing toward our nation’s

capital, Pitt students made signs, prayed ,

the rosary, and were handed literature
detailing the voting records of state and
local representatives with regard to abor-
tion legislation.

Pitt’s Students for Life members,
members of the College Republicans,
and students from the Catholic Campus
Ministries were on their way to meet
other pro—life advocates in Washington
D.C. to commemorate the 24th anniver-
sary of the Supreme Court Roe v. Wade
decision which legalized abortion.

Pitt students arrived at the demon-
stration an hour late and missed many of
the speeches given by March for Life

Other Pittsburgh groups represented
at the march included students of
Duquesne University, St. Paul’s
Cathedral, and a large number of youth
groups from churches all over Western
Pennsylvania.

“It was surprising for me that there
were so many young children there,”
said Steve Westrick, a senior at Pitt. “I
was also surprised that there was hardly
anyone there from the pro-choice move-
ment.”

As the march dissipated in front of
the Supreme Court, Pitt students contin-

politicians’ voting records on abortion

A variety of slogans and pictures

Though "the march gave many a

supporters, some disagreement occurred
over the tastefulness of some of the
posters.

One type of sign that provoked dis-
agreement among the otherwise homo-

ed several enlarged photographs of a 2]-
week-old aborted fetus.

“I don’t think the [aborted fetus]
signs should have been used at all,” said
junior Carey Gallagher. “Not with all the
children around. No child needs to see
that.”

Others thought the posters were par-
ticularly important because of their hor-
rendous depiction.

“I think it was meant to show people
that this procedure is going on,” said Pitt
senior Mariangela Marvin. “I wouldn’t
carry one, but I guess that’s up to the
people who are carrying them.”

support of pro-choice legislation.

On the bus ride home, many
described being moved by the large
number of people at the march.

“The best part of the march for me
was getting up to the top of Constitution
Avenue and looking back down it and
seeing nothing but people who had the
same views I did,” said Allison Imhoff,
16, of Oakland Catholic High School,
who traveled to Washington with her
youth group. “It strengthened my
beliefs.”

Chris Duarte said the peaceful
protest by so many anti-abortion cru-
saders should show the rest of the coun-
try that the stereotypes of these kind of
people are unfounded.

“This is just a peaceful demonstra-
tion. It’s not about violence,” said
Duarte, expressing frustration at the por-
trayal of pro—life demonstrators in the
media. “First of all, with this bombing in
Atlanta, I abhor that [it] is associated
with the pro—life movement. The essence
of the pro-life movement is just that.
We’re pro—life. We don’t believe in mur-
der.”

AmeriCorps and ‘the Learn and
Serve America programs are both direct-
ed by the Corporation for National
Service in Washington, D.C.

But now the CNS is turning away
from the money and credits as a way to
recruit volunteers and looking to a more
philanthropic advertising campaign.
Former U.S. Senator Harris Wofford,
CEO of the Corporation for National
Service, is personally seeing to that goal.

 “One of the problems with

He also drew references to programs

such as the Peace

“That should be

grams like]

Wofford. “We are try-
ing to make that more

In a 1995 government study by the
RAND Corporation in cooperation with
the UCLA Higher Education Research

_Institute, researchers found a strong link

between service and improved academic
performance.

Wofford referred to this as a sec-
ondary beneﬁt. He also pointed to other
factors that some volunteers consider
among the main reasons to serve, but he
says are not.

“One point, but certainly not the
main point, is that there is some ﬁnan-

belief that more students will be able to
develop an active—duty citizenship role
and solve some of America’s problems.

“'Too often college students are por-
trayed as apathetic, Generation X slack-
ers — more concerned about making a
buck than making a difference,” said
Wofford in a recent Journal of Public

hours a day, seven days a week, according
to Boyd.

But more patrols are needed, Boyd
said. Pitt police officers have found it self-
defeating to assign units that merely cover
buildings.

“The reality is that the ofﬁcers are
needed more on the street than in the
buildings, which are [already] secure,”
said Boyd, “We are an open campus, and
as a result we have some interesting peo-
ple that wander in and out.”

The Pitt campus is broken up into
three distinct areas: the area north of Fifth
Avenue, the area between Fifth and
Forbes avenues, and the area south of
Forbes Avenue. The Pitt Police
Department tries to have one police car in
each zone at all times.

“During a typical shift after dark, we
will have three to four one—person cars
out, four. to six ofﬁcers walking foot
beats, two officers walking the Forbes
beat, and two bicycle units,” Boyd said.
“We want our officers, more often than
not, to be on the street where they are vis-
ib1e.”

Boyd said Oakland falls in the middle
of violent crime rankings for the greater
Pittsburgh area. However, Oakland falls
in the top tier of rankings that include
both petty and violent crimes.

As a result, city police details often
cruise the campus area, especially during
Thursday through Saturday nights.

However, the city police carmot
patrol Oakland as much as they used to
due to large cutbacks in ofﬁcers. Not long
ago, the City of Pittsburgh employed
approximately 1,700 officers. This force
has now been reduced to somewhere
around 1,100. This means that Pitt police
officers are increasingly being asked to
cover larger beats.

The Pitt Police department currently
employs 69 sworn officers and over 20
security guards, civilian dispatchers, and
office workers, making it one of the
largest collegiate police departments in
the nation and the third-largest of all
police forces in Allegheny County.

But Boyd said the force is still grow-
mg.

Pitt has funded ﬁve new officer posi-
tions to be added this spring which will
result in an increase to 74 sworn ofﬁcers.

The Pitt police also received a special
grant from state Rep. David Mayemik, a
member of Pitt’s Board of Trustees, to
purchase two Harley-Davidson motorcy-

' cles and outﬁt two officers. The motorcy-

cle units will be added this spring and will
be used for athletic events, special VIP
details, and traflic details on Fifth and
Forbes avenues.

‘The University has shown a willing-
ness to provide the resources to make stu-
dents safe on campus,” said Boyd, “The
combination of the University and the
city police and just the students’ involve-
ment in safety issues has resulted in Pitt’s
becoming a safe urban campus.”

circuit for a lucrative $30,000 per

accepted a position as a visiting profes-
sor of political science at Columbia
University, his alma mater, and will
serve as a political analyst for ABC
news.

When asked about rumors that he
plans to one day run for office himself,
Stephanopoulos responded, “It’.s differ-
ent doing it for yourself, saying only
what you believe, and saying it the way
you want to. I havn’t really decided
yet.”

Stephanopoulos, who was born and
raised in Cleveland, Ohio, did not
always plan on going into politics.
Until he was 14, he intended to follow

ll“

 

in his father’s and grandfather’s foot-
steps by becoming a Greek Orthodox
priest.

Then, in his senior year of high
school, he tried his hand at restaurant
management. “But I did not like getting
up at ﬁve in the morning and making
blue cheese dressing,” he joked.

Finally, Stephanopoulos took an
unpaid internship working for his local
Congressman in Washington, D. C.,
and loved it. He has been involved in
politics ever since, working for
Representative Dick Gephardt, of St.
Louis, and for Michael Dukakis’s failed
1988 presidential bid before joining the
Clinton campaign in 1991.

“I’ll never forget the day I met Bill

Clinton,” Stephanopoulos said. “From
the moment he walked in — and he is a

9 big guy — he just enveloped me, for-

gave me for doing rapid response for
Dukakis and hired me.”

Stephanopoulos is no stranger to
Western Pennsylvania or to Pitt. His
grandfather served as pastor of a church
in Sharon, Pa., and in 1982,
Stephanopoulos, then a junior at
Columbia, published an article in Pitt’s
undergraduate review
“Credibility vs. Fear.”

“I had forgotten about that article
until I was reminded of it tonight,”
Stephanopoulos said of his paper on
Eastern Europe. “I hope none of you
read it,” he joked.

Take the time to consider serving in the AmeriCorps

We would like to applaud the
efforts of the Corporation for
National Service in Washington,
D.C., which directs both the
AmeriCorps and Learn and Serve
America.

Though money will not be
stripped from these programs,
emphasis has been shifted from
serving for the benefits of educa-
tional grants to serving for the
sake of service. The money that is
allotted for educational grants
can only go so far, but that does
not mean that students shouldn’t

(take advantage of the opportuni-

ties for service that are offered by
these programs.

Not only is service good for
the soul, but it also has become a
requirement at many colleges.
One should not disregard the idea
of joining AmeriCorps simply
because he is not eligible for an
educational grant. '

However, this is not to say
that the educational grants award-
ed by AmeriCorps should be for-
gotten or taken away.
AmeriCorps was founded on the

principal of governmental fund-
ing of education in reward for
service. For just under a year of
service, the program itself
includes, for those who are
awarded grants, a grant of $4725
to be used for education as well
as housing, and a stipend during
the service.

AmeriCorps is the domestic
version of the Peace Corps. In the
1960s, students went out to help
people in third world countries.
AmeriCorps now offers service
opportunities within the United

States.

AmeriCorps is a worthy ven-
ture; It is rewarding in its educa-
tional grants and its opportunities
for service. Give it a gander to
see whether AmeriCorps is for
you. Not only can it help you pay
your way through college, but it
can also open the doors to ser-
vice.

get information on AmeriCorps

Before the holiday break, there were two arti-
cles in The Pitt News focusing on Pitt’s pub-
lic image. The articles wisely encouraged stu-
dents to become more concerned with Pitt’s
image if they were someday to display a
University of Pittsburgh diploma on their
office walls. Questions were raised about the
University’s national and international rank-
ing and about many of the daily concerns in
students’ lives that affect the way they feel
about their school.

It is an interesting dilemma In spite of

the criticism in one article that Pitt is “only”

in the second tier of the “best” universities in
the United States, the evidence is over-
whelming that this is an exceptional institu-
tion. Our election, for instance, into the selec-
tive and prestigious American Association of
Universities marks us as one of the top 60
research universities in the United States.
Many -of our schools and departments regu-
larlyrankamongthe very bestinthe country.
This is a solid and respected university that
provides a quality education at a reasonable
price. In fact, Money Magazine in both 1995
and 1996 ranked Pitt as one of the “best col-
lege values” in higher education. The same
publication ranked Pitt’s Honors College as
one of only eight outstanding honors pro-
grams at public universities. _

There are literally hundreds _of other
accomplishments by the University, its facul-
ty, and its students that are worth bragging
about,andIthinkweneedtocometoabet-
ter understanding of these things so that our

1 graduates can indeed hang their diplomas

with pride.

At the same time, I felt that the articles
raised a number of valid points about some of
the problems on campus that negatively
affect the way students view their school. It is
important, I believe, for an involved student
body to bring attention to practices and activ-
ities that they feel are wrong and, more
importanﬂy, for the University leadership to
be responsive to these concerns.

In some ways, the climate for addressing
student concerns has never been better. Over
the past two years, quality of life issues have

become a top priority for the University

administration. Numerous committees con- ‘

sisting of faculty, stall, and students have
been working diligently to improve student
services throughout the University. Student
life issues are no longer only the concern of
the Division of Student Affairs. It is a concern
that is being recognized at every level of the
University, and it is reﬂected in the recent
administrative linkage of the Division of
Student Affairs and  Oﬂice of the Provost

There is much work to be done, and we
need ongoing input ﬁom students to help us
focus this commitment to change in the right
drrectr' ‘on. Articles and editorials such as the
ones in December are instructive and helpful
to us. The student needs srnvey that we con-
ductandthestudentgroupsthatwenmare
also very useful.

In addition, those of us in Student Affairs
encourage all students to share their concerns
(or even their success stories) with us via our
e-mail address: saffairs+@pit1.edu, or by
stopping at the Student Affairs “Question and
Answers” table that will be set up on the
ground ﬂoor of the Wrlliarn Pitt Union each
Wednesday ﬁom 11:30 am. to 1:30 p.rn. I
thinkthatthereisanabundanceofreasonsfor
feeling proud about our University, but that it
also is in everyone’s best interest to work
together on improving the quality of life on
campus for all students.

Where's the school spirit?

While in attendance at a varsity swim-
ming and diving meet one week ago, I truly
felt overwhelmed by contrasting emotions.
Pn'marily,Iwasproud Proudtobeatthe
same college with such dedicated and pas-
sionate individuals as the members of the

 

swirmning and diving team. I was proud to
say that I knew some of those talented ath-
letes who worked so hard (rising early in the
morning for 6 am. practice) and contributed
so much to our school. They accomplish so
much, not only as role models to children at
our local hospitals, but also personally as stu-
dents.

Anridst my feelings of pride for my
school, I felt disgusted and negative. These
feelings occurred when I look around the
fans’ section of the Trees Hall pool, and real-
izedlwas one of only ahandfulof spectators.
Iembracedthedisappointmentthattheteams
such as the swim team must feel when they
begin their meets, matches, and games, and
have NO school support, no positive rein-
forcement, and no fans to cheer them on.

These negative feelings also made me
think of the many organizations that have
poor showings at concerts, speakers, and ral-
lies. I thought of the adrninistration’s disap-
pointment at the lack of student input on
issues, yet there seems to be no lack of stu-
dents complaining.

IsupposethatIhavejustmadeanobser—
vation of student apathy. Realizing that peo-
ple have their own agendas and time com-
rnitrnents, I am certainly not asking every stu-
dent to run for SGB. I am only asking one
thing from students: take the time to go to
ANY sporting event, ANY political or cultur-
al group’s meetings, ANY play, ANY movie
night, ANY famous lecturer. Take out a cou-
ple of hours a month and go to a Student
Govemment Board meeting or a town hall
meeting, which are there for the students.
Embrace the millions of opportunities that
Pitt offers, and hey, guess what  you might
actually enjoy yourself or leam something.
Getting involved, for me, has been the foun-
dation for my college education. Getting
involved has given me a sense of pride, and
the knowledge that one person, yes, one per-
son can actually make a difference.

Sincerely,
Christa Douaihy

Use your voice for choice

It’s time to pause and thank The Pitt
News for its editorial on Jan. 22, 1997, which
recognized the signiﬁcance of the anniver-
sary of Roe v. Wade, a day of reﬂection and
celebration for all people. The right to self-
determination and to living a whole life is
what the pro-choice movement embodies.
The Campus Women’s Organization says
thank you to anyone who has the courage to
respectandtrustawomantomakeherown
decisions.

The backlash in the media continually
grows, harassment and scare tactics have
truned into bombings (Atlanta, Tulsa, and
Washington, D.C.), and the face of anti-
choice America is becoming more accusing.
Ittakesgreatstrengthtoseethroughthepro-
paganda and acknowledge the true issue:
MY BODY, MY CHOICE.

In The Pitt News opinions column
Wednesday, a woman wrote, “any woman‘
having the misfortune of an unwanted preg-
nancy needs to take responsibility for the con-
sequences for her actions.” The Campus
Women’s Organization does not believe in
dictating who to blame, and what women
should and should not do. The author also
wrote, “if a pregnant rape victim does have
an abortion, it still won’t rid her of the mem-
ories of the actual assault.” Again, we dis-
agree with this statement because all people
are different. Sexual assault is a violent and
horrifying violation of a person’s body, soul,

Why would anyone want to be president
of the United States?

There must be something to it. After all,
we spent $40 million last week to inaugurate
a fellow who’s already in oﬂice, and tens of
thousands of people ﬂocked to the capital to
witness it.

To rrre, all that money and manpower
seems like a waste for such an event. It’s like

’ people with power can only make controver-

sial decisions if it involves taking or spending
money. Everybody has his own opinion about
what he’d do if he was the president, but wit-
nessing this hedonistic event drove me mad
until I devised a comprehensive way to solve
the greatest problems facing our nation.
Here’s what I came up with:

First, there’s the inauguration. I’d save us
a bundle by throwing out all the hoopla. The
whole event would only cost as much as a
Bible from your average retail store and a
bullhom for my speech. If that’s too much,
then I’d just swipe a Gideon from a hotel
dresser and use a rolled-up newspaper to
amplify my words.

There -— I’ve already saved $40 million.
But this country has some social problems
that money can’t solve.

We need unity in this country. Issues like
Ebonics and immigration have divided our
land, and we need some oﬂicially-enforced
new language to bind us together.

How about Pig Latin?

That way, even people who speak differ-
ent languages can participate in a regular con-
versation. You just put the ﬁrst letter of a word
last and add an “ay” at the end! I’m not say-
ing this will help us understand each other bet-
ter. We’ll still speak completely different lan-
guages and dialects, but at least it’s a gesture
in the right direction.

VV1th everybody in a daze, our intemal
conﬂicts should end. Then it’s back to busi-
ness, and I’d start with the deﬁcit. A lot of con-
troversy surrounded the balanced budget
amendment, and nothing got done. To hell
with all that bureaucratic mumbo-jumbo. All
it really takes is a little know-how and bold
maneuvering to ﬁx things once and for all.

First, I’d find out where the money is
owed. Then, I’d decide who will get paid and
who will get shafted. As I understand it, a lot
of this money has been borrowed from Social
Security funds. What difference does it make
if we simply refuse to pay them back? Hey,

man, this is America. You don’t like it, get out.

But some people we simply must pay
back. I’m talking about the really tough sons-
of-bitches who might threaten to rearrange
Mount Rushmore’s faces if we don’t give
them their loot. I’ve got another plan to take
care of them.

Most people don’t realize is that there are
tremendous retail opportunities in American
landmarks and properties. We simply stage a
tremendous “Lost our lease: America’s Going
Out of Business Sale! !” '

We get some idiot named Felix who hit
it big in Vegas a few years back to purchase a
couple hundred acres of land and tell him he
can declare it his own country. We charge him
an inﬂated price for some silly strip of high-
way and tell the guy he can declare it his own
country: “The United Acreage of Felix.”
There’s a ton of people like that across this
fruited plain.

If they buy right away, then we throw in
a nifty printing press for free. “Print your own
currency, run your own country!” Who
wouldn’t go for a deal like that?

Rich and overpopulated countries like
Japan would do anything to buy some gov-
emrnent land. What’s it to us? It’s not like the
country is going anyplace. They’d need a
pretty large crane to take Yellowstone
National Park to another continent.

Then there are all the useless monuments
hanging around. We can clear them off the
land and make some money on the side. I’m
sure we could get at least two grand for the
Statue of Liberty. France gave it to us, for cry-
ing out loud, so it’s all proﬁt! Some old
woman in a lirne-green pantsuit could pick it
up at our auction, and for an extra $500 We’ll
throw in an Air Force helicopter to help her
get it home. I don’t think her husband will be
too happy about having to clear room in the
garage for that kind of thing, but hey, that’s his
problem, not ours. All sales are ﬁnal.

The statue at the Lincoln Memorial
would make a nice birdbath for a small—town

aviary. And the Jefferson Memorial just‘

screams “scarecrow.” The reﬂecting pools
could be convened into a big water park,
complete with bumper boats and one of those
“speed slides” that starts at the top of the
Capitol dome, wraps around the Smithsonian,
and ﬁres you across the water so fast your
bathing suit rips off.

We should also get rid of the Washington
Monument. It’s in the way of the slide.
There’s a lot of land around that thing, and
people will be much more likely to buy if they

don’t have to raze a building. So if worse
comes to worst, I’d just have the boys at
NASA put an engine on the thing and ﬁre it
into outer space. We could wait until
Independence Day, fill it with ﬁreworks
before we launch, and blow it up in the
stratosphere for the whole nation to enjoy.
Beforehand, we scatter IRS workers around
the country to charge anyone looking sky-
ward $25.

You have to admit, seeing that giant
granite phallus hurtling into outer space and
exploding would be kind of “neat.” Twenty-
ﬁve dollars is a bargain. Anyone who com-
plains is un—American.

While we’re at it, why not just sell the
entire Washington, D.C. area? Move the cap-
ital to Hawaii. Frankly, it’s prettier there. I will
be able to think more clearly as your presi-
dent, and it’s more secure than D.C. If you
look at a map, those islands are in the middle
of the Paciﬁc Ocean, so it’s not like anyone’s
just going to swoop in and bomb the hell out
of us!

So tl1ere’s my plan. New language, new
capital, and a new vision for America sans
deﬁcit and a bunch of worthless statues.

Now, I know you’re thinking: “Sure! But
now we have no public land!” That may be
true, but it seems you’re forgetting about —
THE ARMED FORCES!!!

You let the warmongers out of the
Pentagon, give them their armies and the tac-
tical weapons (which got us into debt in the
ﬁrst place), and send a battalion to the home
of each person who bought land. Then we
politely ask for it back

Some of them may refuse, I’m sure. _But
for their troubles, we get the battalion leader to
give a demonstration of what happens to a

’ crash—test dunrrny when you stuff it in a 50-

gallon drum and blow it up with a bazooka.

“See that,” the troop leader will say. “Not
a shred of evidence left.” Then we give them
30 seconds to feel patriotic and give the land
back, or feel the inside of a barrel as the lid
slides shut.

So there you have it: my plan for the
presidency. Keep me in mind 15 years from
now when I’ll be eligible to run. I promise to
literally sell the country out from under you,
and then use brute force and threats to get it
back. In recent years, we’ve sold out a lot of
the ideals that made this country great, so why
not sell the iconography too?

Anthony Breznican, the man with the plan,
will be running for president in the year 2016.
Vote for him or else. I

Panthers run with big clogs at Terrier Invite

Over 2,000 athletes gathered last
weekend at Boston University for the
Terrier Invitational indoor track meet. It
was Pitt’s biggest meet of the year so far,
and there were some big-tirne perfor-
mances to match.

No Panthers ﬁnished first in their
events, but there were
plenty of second- and
third-place ﬁnishes, as
well as a handful of
postseason qualifying
performances.

The women’s dis-
tance medley relay
team of Anna Kohler,
Nina Carter, Chantee
Earl, and Stephanie Ellsworth ﬁnished
11tl1, withatime of 12 minutes, 11.78 sec-
onds. That time ends several weeks of
near—misses and ﬁnally qualiﬁes the team
for the ECAC championships.

“Right now, Stephanie Ellsworth ‘is
our best miler. We have the luxury of her

 

already having qualiﬁed in the 5,000
meters,” said Pitt Head Coach Steve
Lewis. “That means we can use her in the
mile [leg of the distance medley]. She and
Anna Kohler have both made sacriﬁces in
their events so we can bring a whole team
together and have a full loa .”

Two of Pitt’s elite individual athletes
further solidiﬁed their status last weekend.
Angie Martin had a season—best time of
2:08.51 in the 800
meters. Martin’s is
among the top four
times in the nation this
season.

Trecia Smith,
already qualiﬁed for
the NCAA champi-
onships in the long
and triple jumps, fm-
ished third in both the high jump and the
shot put at Boston, with performances of
5-6 and 44-10 3/4 respectively.

“[Srnith is] taking her other events to
the upper level,” Lewis said. “She is a
long—jurr1per going into a meet like this
and placing third in the shot and high

jump-97

Other women qualifying for the
ECAC meet included Joetta Purter and
Nina Carter. Both had season—best times

in the 500 meters. Purter had 1:15.93; ; - - —

Carter had 1:16.12.

The star of the day for the men was
Scott Curry. Curry’s time of 2:28.25 in the
1000 meters qualiﬁed him for the IC4A
championship meet in the event.

“We felt he was capable of doing it.
He came and did it. He’s our ﬁrst 1,000-
meter qualiﬁer in maybe 10 years,” Lewis
said.

Cuny, along with Rich Walsh, Scott
Gilpin, and Carl Taylor, also got Pitt’s 2-
rnile relay team qualiﬁed for the IC4A
meet. Their time of 7:36.63 was good for
second place in the meet. It also gives Pitt
the second—fastest time in the East so far
this season. I

“’They’re getting together and doing
what they’re capable o ,” Lewis said.
“And the nice thing about that gang is
they’re all underclassmen.”

Next Saturday, Pitt travels to the
George Mason Invitational in Fairfax, Va.

Freshmen help Panthers pull big swim upsets

Thanks to Pitt’s devel-
oping and dominating fresh-
man class, the women’s
swim team travelled to
Philly last weekend and
upset reining Big East cham-
pion Villanova and thrashing
LaSalle. ,

Against ‘Nova, the Pitt
freshmen took home 5 of 13
events, leading Pitt to victory
136-105. On Saturday
against LaSalle, they again
won ﬁve events in the 150-

“The freshmen are
doing a really good job. We
need girls to step up and
swim and that’s what they’re

Samantha Chabotar and
Jennifer Slack crushed the
opposition. Chabotar came
in at 10:15.46, and Slack
claimed second with
10:24.36. The Wildcats
rebounded in the 500-meter
freestyle with a first and sec-
ond. Freshman Heather
Brennan won the 50-meter
freestyle in 24.79, touching
out a ‘Nova swimmer by .10.
Frosh Jamie Tomazich
won both the 1- and 3-meter
diving events. It was the
fourth time this year that she
had won both events in the
same meet. The other fresh-
man diver, Cheryl Anderson,
placed second in the 1-meter
and fourth in the 3-meter.
After the 1-meter dive,
Pitt was up, and freshman

2:08.87. Sophomore Jenny
Banks placed third with a
2:11.01. The freshman class
contributed again when Beth
Grube won the 200-meter
backstroke at 2:03.66.

Pitt finished off
Villanova with wins by
Chabotar in the 500—meter
freestyle at a 5:02.54 and a
win in the 400-meter
freestyle relay by Isabelle
Dejo, Melissa Burns, Grube,
and Brennan at a 3:35.21.

“It was an exciting win
for us because we were the
underdogs. Now we know
we can swim with anyone in
the Big East, and that has
everyone pumped,” said
Burns.

Against LaSalle, Perry
broke into the win column

Nicole Palombo won the
100-meter breaststroke with
a 1:09.62. Tomazich was
superb again in both diving
events. In the 1—meter diye,
she won by more than 80
points, and in the 3-meter,
she edged her opponent by
20 points. Brennan won the
l00—meter free with a 54.08.

The women ﬁnished the
meet strongly when Erin
Bissel won the 200-meter
breaststroke (2:26.92),
Chabotar the 500-meter
freestyle (5200.07), and
Slack the 100-meter butter-
ﬂy (1:O0.28) and 200-meter
freestyle relay (1:39.02.)

“We knew we could win
this meet and a lot of girls
swam their off events,” said
Burns.

Back—to—back road games, play-
ers plagued with injuries, and oppo-
nents they weren’t supposed to beat
was the scenario the Pitt hockey team
faced this past weekend.

In the face of adversity, the
Panthers stood tall. Led by goalie Pat
Kenny and captain Bill Elliott, Pitt
defeated both I.U.P. (Division 2) 4-1
on Saturday and I.U.P. (Division 1)
7-2 Friday night in Indiana, Pa.,
improving its overall record to 10-1-
1 and 7-0-1 in its division.

Contributing to Pitt’s victorious
sweep of both I.U.P. teams with
either points or stellar defensive play

were Brad Rizzo, Ryan Moore, Toki -

Baron, Matt White, Bob Hoehn, and
Mark Hoehn.

When Pitt took the ice Saturday
night against I.U.P. (Division 2), it
was forced to make some position
changes due to the injuries suffered
by Travis Wills, Shawn Goldstein,
and Mike Girvin Friday night. The
Panthers accepted the challenge.

- With 7:35 left in the first period,
Moore scored, assisted by Mark
Hoehn, giving Pitt a 1-0 lead.

In the second period, the
Panthers took advantage of a power
play when Elliott scored, assisted by
Bob Hoehn, 1 minute, 47 seconds
into the period, giving Pitt a 2-0 lead.

“Bob Hoehn shot, and I tipped it
in through the goalie’s 1egs,” Elliott
said. “It was a good, low shot from
Bob.”

With 3:40 left in the second peri-
od, I.U.P.’s Matt Bosco scored, mak-

Elko also finished first in the 100 -

Haggerty won the 200 meter but-
terﬂy (l:52.30) and teamed with
Brendan Lupetin, Adam Kotkiewicz,
and Eric Stefanski to win the 200-meter I
freestyle relay (1 :25.95). Two members
of the relay team won individual
events. Kotkiewicz won the 200-meter
backstroke (1:54.69), and Stefanski
won the 100-meter backstroke (52.42).

In the l00—meter breaststroke, Pitt
produced the top three finishers. Scott
VanEpps (1200.31) nipped teammates
Cherep (1:00.33) and Mike Pron, who
finished third (1:02.l2). Pron also won

the 200-meter breaststroke (2: 10.70),

Senior John Soulakis dominated
the diving competition, winning both
the 1-meter and 3-meter with scores of
318.15 and 317.17, respectively.

“We did very well,” said Head
Coach Chuck Knoles. “I think the guys
are starting to turn around and look
more like a championship team every
meet that we have.”-

Knoles’ team backed up.his evalu-
ation the following afternoon against
Villanova.

Pitt was once again led by
Haggerty and the freshman trio of
Elko, Cherep, and Koller. The four-
some set a record time at DuPont Pool

in the 200-meter V medley relay
(1234.45) and won three individual
events. Koller won the 50-meter
freestyle (21.23), Elko won the 200-

Haggerty took first place in the 200-

Howard was a lottery draft pick for

The second half of the season must
have been the best six weeks of
Howard’s life, as he put in two good
games Versus the Forty—Niners and the
Panthers before his breakout perfor-
mance on Sunday.

In becoming the firstspecial teams
player ever to win the Super Bowl
MVP, Howard secured his place in the
history books. In becoming this week’s
prospective Sports Illustrated cover
boy, he may have also made some peo-
ple forget about his earlier failures.

worry about any more bus trips.

“We’ve done an awful lot of
travelling this year,” said Knoles. “I

THE PITT NEWS

Hockey

ing it a 2-1 hockey game.

Not only did I.U.P. score to get
back in the game, but they managed
to get Rizzo ejected for fighting.

“Brad was playing aggressively
and going after loose pucks,”
Assistant Coach Rick Niedt said.

Afterbeing tackled in front of the
net, Rizzo got up and exchanged
words with the player who knocked
him down.

“Before you knew it, they'were
swinging,” Niedt said.

With the loss of Rizzo, Pitt’s lead
was threatened. They looked to the
fourth line to step it up, and they did.

“Dan Gynn and Wally Sheide
stepped it up and Mark Hoehn was a
standout, hitting everything that
moved,” Head Coach Dickie Rizzo
said. “Bill Elliott had a good game,
three goals, and he played almost the
entire game.”

Pitt fans were able to breathe a
sigh of relief as its one-goal lead was
increased 15 seconds into the third
period when Elliott blew past the
I.U.P. defense, decked the goalie, and
scored his second of the contest.
Elliott’s goal, assisted by Matt Kerec,
gave Pitt a 3-1 lead.

With 2:45 left, Elliott got the hat
trick, scoring after tipping in a low
shot by Tony Hermankevich to give
Pitt a 4-1 win.

“The team showed a lot of heart,”
Elliott said. “We were down a lot of
men and overcame a lot of adversity
to win the game.”

Pitt got off to the same rocky start
on Friday night against I.U.P.
(Division 1), but this time it wasn’t
due to injuries. A slow start and
penalties plagued the team.

Despite the slow start, Pitt defeat-
ed I.U.P. 7-2 with six different play-

-ers contributing a goal. Kenny kept

the Panthers in the game, making an
impressive 38 saves.

One minute into the game, Rizzo
scored, assisted by Girvin, giving Pitt
a quick 1-0 lead.

A minute later, I.U.P.’s
Schlow scored, tying the game.

With just 5:00 left in the first
period, Lou Jones scored, giving
I.U.P. a 2-1 lead.

Pitt tied the game with 4:40 left in
the game, as Moore scored unassist-
ed.

Jay

With just 1:29 remaining, Elliott
scored, assisted by Matt Danzuso.
For the first time in the game, Pitt had
the lead, a lead that would only
increase.

Midway through the second peri-
od, Danzuso scored, assisted by
Goldstein, giving Pitt a 4-2 lead.

I.U.P. put on the pressure, but was
denied by Kenny time and time again.

“He took the fight out of them,”
Niedt said of Kenny. '

Recalling one of Kenny’s more
impressive saves, Niedt said, “He
was in a split. The shot went over his
left shoulder and he snagged it out of
midair with his glove behind his
head. It was a pretty save.”

Not only did Kenny make a pret-
ty save, but Elliott scored a pretty
goal, a backhand wraparound minutes_
later, giving Pitt a 5-2 lead. Baron
assisted on Elliott’s second goal of
the contest.

The Panthers continued racking
up the points. With 8:26 left in regu-
lation, Woodbury scored a power-
play goal, assisted -by Rizzo and
Baron, giving Pitt a 6-2 lead.

With 2:07 left in regulation, Pitt
put the icing on the cake. Baron
scored, assisted by Elliott, giving Pitt
a 7-2 victory.

“The win wasn’t due to any one
person,” White said. “It was due to
the team.”

Pitt plays Slippery Rock
Saturday, Feb. 1, at Neville Ice Rink
on the South Side at 10:30 p.m. Pitt
tied SRU the first time these two
teams met.

“We’re looking forward to play-

ing SRU again since they’re the only.

blemish in our otherwise undefeated
division record,” Niedt said.
