Merely Talks

Lack of a quorum forced Stu-
dent Congress Monday to cancel
its regular meeting and meet as a
_committee. _

The legislators discussed things
of importance that they plan to
recommend to next year’s Stu-
dent Congress. ‘

It was also announced that‘in-
stead of only ID cards, schedule
cards and ID cards‘ would be -used
in voting. Separate ballots ‘will
be used for the different schools,
with the names of the candidates
to be voted on by each group in-
stead of all the candidates on
them. , ' ,

The practice of keeping women’s
nominations secret until the day
before election was also discussed.
Audrey Westerman said that this
was to eliminate politics in
campaigning.’ Louis W. H. John-

stated that he saw nothing wrong
with politics. “The only place I
know ofiwhere there are no poli-
ticsiis jail,” he said. _

FRIDAY, APRIL 8,- -1949

F W J I J Balloting
VVith election time only ﬁve days away, Pitt women‘ face
an anxious week-end. Balloting is scheduled for \Vednesday
from 9:30 a. m. to 4:30 p. 111. in 1217 C1. ~ ~
Nominees will be notiﬁed by Senior Court tomorrow after- i.
noon through’ its clearing house. Sinc_e clearing house consists"
of calling the prospective nominees for consent or rejection
of nominations, Court reports it is imperative for women in
activities to “stand by their phones Saturday.” ‘

Only after the business of clearing nominees occurs Sat-
éurday can the women’s slate, be

drawn up in its correct form. The
list of women nominees »will be
published in the News Tuesday,
a day prior to elections.‘
Nominees will be feted at the
annual Nominees’ Supper Tuesday
night at 5:30 p. m. in Hotel Schen-
ley. Feature of the evening is a-
skit prepared and presented by
.the’Senior Court, Class of 1949.

Old Court in Skit

At this dinner, the old Court
yields its place to the Court of
the Class of 1950. Out-going Court
members, Ruth Raupp, Katie. Gas-
kin, Margie Kostelnik,g Jeanne
Ditz, Ginny Reynolds, Lee Mus-
soil‘, and Pat Seger, promiseia
“Wha’ Hopponed” skit to cele-

brate the expiration of their term’

of office. ,

A traditional feature of the din-
ner is the part of the program
given over to the introduction of
nominees. Each coed introduces
her own running‘ mate; , ‘

Members of Court explain this
is something like shaking hands
before an encounter."

Also on the agenda for the 'Nom- I I

inees’ Supper is an informal chat
by Miss Helen Pool Rush, dean of
women. The dinner is sponsored

«by Senior‘Court, but there is no .
charge, for nominees, who are, 
guests of the University for the E ’ 

evening. V I
Vote on Wednesday ‘
At the polls Wednesday, coeds
will name their student leaders
for the academic year. 1949-50..
Class officers, WSGA heads, Stu-
dent Congress representatives, and

all women’s organization execu- .

tives will be chosen. E
Since a heavy turnout’ is neces-
sary for a representative selection
of oiﬁcers, Court urges every wo-
man on campus to vote. It has
been estimated _by Lee Mussoﬁ,
Chief Justice, that voting will
take only three or four “minutes.
Voters may identify themselves
at thevpolls by showing their stu-

dent identiﬁcation card. To facili- _

tate the smooth operation of-the
polls, Court recommends that vot-
ers have these cards easily acces-
sible when they enter the ballot-
ing area.

AN END TO THE MAZEK

Audrey VVesterman’s academic advisor scheme, if
adopted and properly put into action, will be the death
of one of Pitt’s oldest traditions—the “poor, bewildered,
little freshman.” There shouldn’t be too many objections
to the elimination, though.

' The counselor plan, now being studied by the Uni-
versity Senate, which will, if it approves, put the'program-
into action, provides for a sort of shepherding of new Pitt
students, who can easily get tangled in the web of de-
tails, requirements, exceptions that must be unmeshed be-
fore the student gets his diploma.

As proposed by Miss \Vesterman, who drew up the

plan as a Student Congress committee projectpincoming
students would be assigned a faculty advisor fromtheir ma— '
J01‘ department. Those‘ undecided, and they are many,—_
would fall under the supervision of a general advisor.
_ Dean Theodore W. Biddle summed up the deans’ opin-
ion of the latter clause as “wet-nursing,” saying “it is
part of growing up to assume responsibility for your own‘
welfare.”

_ But it’s these new students~that need some sort of
guidance through the maze of getting started toward that
college education. They don’t know for sure what they
want to study, need some experienced assistance to make
the decision. The young men and women wholhave a ma-

‘ J01‘ in mind also have a goal in mind. They have the start.

The overall picture, looking ahead, is satisfying. It.
shows the mammoth urban university, that is, Pitt, picking
up a trait usually reserved for small colleges—,bringing the
‘students closer to their University, _, eliminating the come- '
to-school, go-to-class,‘.'go-home routine now too. common
among too many students.

_ ~When a student comes to know even only one instruc-
tor, his advisor, he almost automatically becomes’ a bit
more, interested in the school. He no longer sees the school
as “one fouled up mess,” because the advisor helps him
Enltélngle -the confusion of quality-points, credits, required

e s. ~

This may be_painting too rosy a picture," for the .\sysi
tern could easily become complicated as badly as the com-
plications it’s designed to case.

But it certainly seems the plans is worth a try. A lot
of seniors during the past fewyears have been quite un-
happy, when the time came to graduate, with an education
almlassed during four years packed with unpleasant loop-

By LES GALLAGHER

"wen, what with Spring Festival
coming up I think it only ﬁtting
and proper that we should have a
column on Spring Festival. I
thought this thought to myself
just the other day so I? sent my
representative to a behind the
scenes Spring Festival committee
conference.

My representative, Asa O’Toole,
sat quietly in a] corner and said

nothing. He just smiled his smile
while the wheels of the University
prepared to give the University
a bigger and better than ever be-
fore Carnival-Festival Week.

Pass ‘Hie Pipe

Asa came back from the meet-
ing and, after I got him to stop
laughing, he gave me the scoop.
“I got there after the opium,” Asa
said-.’ “What do you mean, opium?”
I opined. “They must have been
had a beautiful‘ jag-on.” “Who
ya’ mean by throwing slurs-like
that upon thosewho are endeavor-
ing to give you a biggerand bet-
ter than ever before ‘Carnival-
Festival W-eek?” I"said.

“I mean that ‘they couldn’t have
thought up more elaborate plans
for Spring Festival than if they

“Well, that’s better-, always clarify
yourself,” I said. “I’l1 clarify my-
self,” Asa said, “and you’ll see,
you’ll see when I tell you the
story, you’ll see that they’re
nothin’ but a lot of hop-hounds.” ’

“Watch, your _language,” ‘I
screamed. “No,” Asa said, and
continued his story.

Real Terrific

“I went to the meeting and
some rather heavy set guy starts
the ball rolling. ‘I-Iow’s carnival
publicity?’ this guy A1 ‘says: ‘Ter-

' riﬁc,’ says a guy named Ted. ‘The

carnival will? be terriﬁc.’ ‘Every-
body sits around and mumbles,
real’ excited like. ‘Ted says the
carnival will be terriﬂcl’ Much
applause and. hootin’ and hollerin’.
‘Any ideas, Ted?’ A1_,says. ‘Yeah,’
Ted says. Everybody sits around
and mumbles all excited like,
‘Ted’s got ideas.’

“ ‘What kind ’ asks Al, begin-
ning to ‘take an interest._ ‘Oh, I

‘ think .I’ll bring in a couple of‘ net

shows to do their broadcast from
the carnival location,’ Ted says.
This is where I suspect, I was late
for the opium,” Asa said. “"How
ya’ goin’” to do it?’ asks Al. ‘Oh,
I have connections,’ says Ted,
spitting playfully into the air.

Lots of Connections.

“Everybody sits around and
mumbles real excited like, ‘Ted’s
got connections.’ I don’t care if
Ted has more connections than a
plumbers union,” Asa said, “he
ain’t agoin’ to get no net shows
to pull their broadcasts from here.
It’s all they can do to’ get Art
Pallen out of downtown what
with police escorts and all, so

- how they goin’ to bring a whole

show in from New York? Con-
nections, consmections."

“Yeah, Asa, I guess you’re right,
you were probably late for the
opium.” “Why "does. everything
have to be bigger and better and
greater than ever, why not one
just as good as?” ‘Asa aked.

. Although the column is personal,
the moral of the story is general.
We have some mighty big men
aroundthis institution. Some of
them must be all of six feet. Then

some of them» aren’t even thatibig.
They just think they are.

Pliipps Flo wer Slm wMe-nacetl

By SHIRLEY LEVINE

Everybody is happy about the early spring weather! That is
everybody but the gardeners at Phipps Conservatory.

The 56th annual Spring Flower Show, which has been at the
Conservatory since March 27 and will remain until Easter Sunday,
April 17, ran into a great deal of difficulty because of the unusually

mild weather.

Thousands of plants had to be moved to quarters which were
in the coolest parts of the Conservatory.

Under ‘normal weather conditions, these plants would have
remained in place for the normal forcing season. Bulbs which
during normal years require eight weeks to be forced into bloom

were blossoming in three weeks¢

or less. Shading of roofs had to
take place many weeks in ad-
vance of the time normally re-
quired.

_ Array is Breathtaking

Despite the, difficulties, the
Flower Show is as breathtaking
as always. The Conservatory is
"‘bustin’ out all over” with pan-
sies, tulips, hyacinths,' narcissi,
azaleas, lilies, and primroses.

Total number of ﬂowers is close
to a Pitt enrol1ment—22,000.

As has been the custom, the
show is made up of eight gardens,
each differing in its entirety and
.composition from the others.

Special favorite of the show is
a. symmetrical arrangement of
azaleas, dogwood, and tulips. .

There are two gardens repeated
from last year. One is the famous
cross done in white baby prim-
roses surrounded by Easter lilies
and purple cineraries with yellow
genistas used to effect radiating
lines of light.

Lights and Music, Too

One of the spectacular features
of, the show is an electric foun-
tain with ﬁve changes of colored
lights and six changes of water
effects. Add to this pleasant back-
ground music, and you have what
is commonly termed: “atmosphere.”

Last year more than 130,000 per-
sons visited the Conservatory, and
from all indications the 1949 at-
tendance will top even that large

ﬁgure.

Bethany Here I

For Panthers’
Tennis Debut  

By DAVE POLLOCK

Pitt opens its 1949 tennis season
tomorrow against the Bethany Bi-”
sons on the Arsenal courts. The
opening match is scheduled for
2 p.m. ,

If Panther conﬁdence is any-

indication of the possible out-
come, then Dr. Dave O’Loughlin’s
netters should win in a breeze.

As Stan Weil, a letterman from I

last year’s squad,- puts it, “One
thing that we can guarantee you
this year is a good tennis team.
We don’t ﬁgure to lose very many
matches.”

Bethany will also be playing
their ﬁrst match of the year and
the quality of their squad is un-
known. But as far as the Panthers
are concerned the Bisons will be
the ﬁrst victims of a successful
campaign.

Coach O’Loughlin is still unde-
cided about the starters, ‘but
Johnny Leohstetter, Stan Weil,
Walt Schoenberger, Joe Rauter-

an . ..o.....s.....-gay

kus, and Bob Silberstein are as- ’ I

sured of starting berths, with Jim-
Boyd, Ralph Mason, Dick Hogan,
Johnny Roberts, and Al Margus

still ﬁghting it out for the re-

maining three positions.

Dr. O’Loughlin plans to dress
eight men‘ for the homevmatches
and carry six men on the travel-
ing squad’.

Six singles and three doubles

contests’ will make up each match.

DOERGE .
continue _ on their merry ,way,

speculation‘ has begun as to the players who will replace the gradu-
’ ating regulars of last year, with the quarterback ‘spot drawing ﬁrst

attention.

In an effort to bolster the important blocking slot, Head Coach

‘Walter (Mike) Milligan is‘ experimenting with Bobby Lee.

Milligan thinks that Lee, a three year veteran at halfback, may

be the man to spell off Lou Me1il1u¢
offensively, as well as see double
duty on defense. v A
' More Depth Needed

With Melillo the, only steady
s/ignal_ caller returning from the

depth at that post was apparent.
Seniors Pete» Fuderich, who al-
ternated with Melillo as the offen-

service as defensive line backer-

this fall. .
As mentioned, Lee will prob-

on offense and defense. Late last
season, Bobby saw plenty of ac-
tion as line backer, and, observ-
ers ‘claim the New Castle senior
did a bang-up job.

The former halfback’s perform-
ance in that capacity undoubtedly
was a contributing factor in
prompting the present shift. As a
blocker, Lee's rating is “‘ade'—
quate.” '

Milligan Hesitant

Milligan is hesitant to commit
himself on his plans for Lee. He
simply says, “Yes, Bobby’s work-
ing out over there. We’ll try him
out, but it’s too early to tell any-
thing.”

In addition to Lee, outstanding
freshmen vieing for the blocking
position are Bob Brennen and
