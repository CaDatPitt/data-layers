Role of Urban University Students

By ALEX D’IPPOLITO

The Frick Fine Arts building and the Univer--

sity administration were criticized, the mount of
freedom at the University was discussed, and two
conﬂicting views ,,of the role of students were
analyzed at the forum “A Berkeley at Pitt? The

 Revolutions in the Urban Universities.” Saturday. .

morning in the Student Union Ballroom. The forum
was part of the Parents’ Weekend program.

Dr. Morris Berkowitz, associate professor of so-
ciology, criticized the use of the Henry Clay Frick
Fine Arts building, saying it had unjustiﬁable
restrictions placed upon it. ‘

John Ruskay, liberal arts sophomore and Stu-
dent Government Senator, charged that the ad-
ministration “hasn’t changed its attitude toward

-gsrthe student body” in the .last ten years and that

this was a prime reason for student discontent
on campus. Eric "Stern, liberal arts senior and for-
mer SG president, said that the administration
was denying. students their rights. and the stu-
dents were “being oppressed” at the University.

Jerry Hogan, engineering senior and SG pres-
ident, and Martin Engels, liberal arts junior and
SG senator, both agreed that although improve-
ment is needed at the University adequate means
of achieving these goals exists and that students
should work through these channels.

Mrs. Erma T. Meyerson, professor of social
work, said that “Students should have a proving
ground to test out their ideas’ and values” but
ithaththe important thing is for students, “to act
responsibly.” . A .

At the beginning of the discussion the ﬁve.pan--
elists each gave a brief interpretation of the ‘causes

dent Jerry Hogan, moderator Dan Stern, Eric Stern,
and Marty Engels.

of the Berkeley riots and of the possibility of
their happening here. ’ ‘

Dr. Berkowitz did not feel that a student rev-.
olution was “either probable or necessary at the
University because “students are not forbidden
their status as citizens” such as at.Berkeley. “This
is ‘a free campus,” «he said. “We,..do have._free
speech.” “ "i '

He cited -the students involvement in the 1964
elections and the bus trip to Alabama last March
when students went to demonstrate. against racial
discrimination as examples of what students may”
do at the University. » -

. In answering criticism of certain types of stu-
dent activitism, Dr. Berkowitz said, “If the Uni-
versity can’t stand , the likes "of Eric Stern and
John Ruskay, ‘then they can’t stand me because
I don’t wantito teach the clods left over.”

"Hogan thanked the professor for calling -him
as clod, but Dr. Berkowitz qualiﬁed his statement
by saying that he was referring to the student
who participates in nothing outside the classroom.

Engels said that the basic question in evaluat-
ing student involvement is to ask what one is seek-
ing to accomplish‘ at the University. He believed .
that a student should come to _the University “to
develop as a mature individual, to express himself,
and to ﬁnd, his identity.” Asserting Berkeley stu-
dents lost their identity and that such is not the
case at the University, Engels» did not think that
“this (a‘Berke1ey)' is necessary here. Do you think
that if we would sit on a sidewalk for eight hours
we would become more mature_ individuals?” he
asked.

“The sole aim of both Miss
Rush and me was to safeguard
the ﬁnances of Student Govern-
ment,” Vrana continued. “We
only demanded some assurances
of sales before more Directories
were ordered.” At’ the same time
Vrana made clear that he also
desired that “anybody who want-
ed a Directory would have the
opportunity to buy one.”

Vrana viewed his role, as ﬁ-

-as “working with the committee
from the beginning to ‘evolve a
budget together. I was able to
give, complete control of the ﬁ-
nances to the business manager
of Parents’ Weekend and the
chairman of Freshmen Outing.
There we evolved a budget to-
gether.” '

Vice-Chancellor Rush support-
ed Vrana’s position and said
“We didn't want to stoltify the
sales. We want as many sold as
possible. We only wanted some
way. of estimating .the demand
forthe Directory.” 0 " ' '

Miss Rush explained that her
office is ultimately responsible to
the University for .the ﬁnances of
the Student Directory and she
wanted to avoid "a deﬁcit. She
suggested, as did Vrana, that 500
Directories be ordered instead of
1,000 that then editor Dave Ur-
baitis suggested. If there was a

3 Meet Tonight

The Men’s_ Dorm Council
(MDC) will meet tonight to
discuss its new dorm poli-
cies at 6:30 in'the Towers.
The meeting is open to all
those who wish to express
their opinion on the rules gov-
erning use of the Towers lobby.
by University recognized student
organizations.
The rules were by former Stu-
dent Government President Eric"

-Stern as inhibiting freedom of

speech. They were supported by
one house in the Towers. which
felt that solicitation is an, inva-
sion of privacy.

According to Harvey Lefton,
president of MDC, the rules need
clariﬁcation but are" serving “on
an interim basis. The rules should
be the rules of the men. The
doors are always open for com-
ments. We hope to ﬁnd out the
men’s feelings at tonight’s meet-
ing.”

Lefton further stressed that,
“the rules are mean to censor.”
He pointed out that the forma-

(Continued from Page 1),
“Are we really being oppress-
, ed?” Engels continued. j‘Are our
-educational goals being denied?
.I don't think so.’.’

' In his interpretation of the
, happenings on the. California
I campus, Stern said, “Berkeley
does not mean riots. It does not
' necessarily mean revolution. It

fully legal, «to achieve student ex-
pression and freedom.” Stern said
— that the recent Men's Dorm Coun-
cil’(MDC) ruling which restricts
' the passing out of literature in
the Towers (see story page one.)
' “is intolerable” because, he be-
l.‘\1ieVeS, it curtails freedom of
. speech and expression.

“We are an integral part of

Pittsburgh,” Hogan said in ex-
plaining the role of the Univer-
sity. Therefore, “the student has
, a responsibility to himself and
the University before taking up-
i on himself illegal actions.”
 » Mrs. Meyerson said that it was
" very difficult to “try to ferret out
what happened at Berkeley.”
Students there felt that educa-
tion was on a mass basis, she
said, that they were a card
through a computer, and that
 “professors published while stu-
V dents perished.”

“It is unfortunate,” she con-
tinued, “that more students don’t
express their opinions and be-
liefs, no matter what they are.
. I hope to see more activities on
« campus no matter what their
point of view.” The goal would
be for students to “have a voice
in all University affairs that re-
late to their welfare.”

Ruskay said that although “the
-University has the potential, and
is becoming, one of the ﬁner in-

raanty, Students Give
Ideas on Education

” means using every means, hope-V

stitutions of education, there is
student discontent at the Uni-
versity.”

The quality of the. University
and the student body have im-
proved in the last ten years, ‘he
said, but the administration is
not allowing the students to
achieve their full potential. “The
undergraduate feels he is. en-
titled to be treated as a young
adult in matters outside of
school,” he said.

Ruskay cited the administra-
tion’s ‘ refusal to allow students
full control of the activities fee
allocations and said that that
along with the “infringement of
civil liberties” under the new
MDC ruling concerning literature
distribution in the Towers (See
story page 1) were several of the
sources of student content.

“The Berkeley clash of 1964

certainly will not be the last of ‘

these clashes,” he warned.

All the panelists agreed that
only a small portion of the stu-
dent body at Berkeley were in-
volved in the demonstrations and

that only a small portion of the

University students were engaged
in student activities and outside
projects. All agreed that more
students should be activitists al-
though there was disagreement
as to the extent that activity
should go or as to the means
that should be used.

In response to a question from
-a parent in the audience about to
whom or to what should the stu-
dent be accountable, Engels re-
plied, “to society, his parents, and
to hinnelf.” Stern said, “to man-
kind,” and Hogan answered, “to
ourselves and our community in
which We live.”

Urbaitis,,Vrana Give Views  
On Student Directory Issue

1‘ (Continued from Page 1)

Rothman continued, “Yet, David Urbaitis and his staff
have proven their ability to sell, and I feel that if additional
books would be ‘sold, they would do it quickly. There are
various viewpoints concerning the success of additional
sales. I’m willing to support a person who /has proven him-

self once.”

Urbaitis resigned as editor of
the Student Directory {last Fri-
day over the disagreement on or-
dering more Directories, out of
the original 1,500, 1,300 books
had been sold by last Wednesday,
according to Urbaitis. At that
time he requested permission
from Vrana to order another
1,000.

Urbaitis said that Vrana asked

“that we should get advanced»
orders from the University de-”

partments for as many Direc-
tories as they needed. He felt if
any student wanted a Student
Directory he could order them on
an individual order basis also.”

However, Vrana explained that
he never asked for individual
student orders. Rather, he wanted
an estimation of the demands of
the engineering students and the
women living in the Nurses Res-
idence for example.

Explaining other accusations
made against him, -Vrana said, “I
never claimed that the Directory
had gone over its budget. As it
stands now the Directory should
make a small proﬁt. Further, I
never challenged the Student
Government allocation of $200 to
the Student Directory budget.
They have had that money since
last August.”

While Urbaitis claims that he
has taken $715 in Directory sales,
to date Vrana has received de-
posits for only $584.70. Vrana did
explain that his ﬁgure doesn’t in-
clude money for Directories sold
in the last few days.

Vrana had no way of estimat-
ing what is the amount of the
most recent sales since he has
received no deposits. He suggest-
ed that in the case of the Stu-
dent Directory that perhaps the
director of student publications
would be a better ‘financial ad-
viser than himself. He said he
hadn’t had “the opportunity to
work with the editor as much as

Rothman did.”

All parties agreed on the high
quality of the publication. Roth-
man felt the staff “had done well
on a low budget. The possibility
of making a small proﬁt is en-
ticing me; it would be unusual
for a publication at the Univer-
sity, because all publications are
operated on tight budgets.”

‘Alma. Mater’
Compared To
‘ Nazi Anthem

Editor, The Pitt News:

"While studying at the Euro-
pean-American Study Center in
asel, Switzerland, we University
tudents are experiencing many
new attitudes and learning many
new things. Among them is a
new-found knowledge of the con-
notation of the tune to our alma
niater--something many Univer-
lty students do not realize.
 One of us attended a concert

helmschule of Kassel, Germany.

erminated the introductory seg-
ment with the musical version
of a song which begins, “Ger-
many, Germany, over all.” (Deu-
tschland, Deutschland Ueber Al-
‘-'”les.)~ The song was also a, proud
part of Nazi Germany. The tune
was the same as that of our
alma mater.

“When your fellow University
student began to sing along, she
was criticized by a Swiss. Ap-
iarently, to even hum the tune
n at least Italy or Switzerland
enough to remind the people
of the hated Nazi Germany, and
s,-therefore, highly frowned upon.
Whereas it is certain that our
alma mater was not fashioned af-
r the German version, but that

perience with you, believing that

Objection Raised

Once a week .a friendly and
cheerful lady comes in and not
' only makes the beds, but dusts,
cleans the ﬂoor, and in general
tidies up. The appalling aspect
of this is that these women often"

male students find it necessary
to plaster their walls with so

called “pin-ups” of nude or par-'

ornamentation it_ is in poor taste,
but when he forces others to be
exposed to it, it becomes deeply
objectionable. For this reason I

Senator Explains,
Backs Vrana’s
Directory Move

Editor, The Pitt News:

After learning from Friday’s
edition of The Pitt News that
the editor of the Student Direc-
tory, Dave Urbaitis, had resigned
his position, I talked with some
of the people involved and I may
be able to clear up some ideas
which» you have not presented.

First, as a member of Student
Government (SG), I would like
to congratulate Mr. Urbaitis and
his staff for preparing an excel-
lent Student Directory for,SG in
record time for a very reason-
able price. They worked extreme-
ly hard on this project and their
efforts to serve the students of
this University should be com-
mended. » ~
, It is for this reason that I find
Mr. Urbaitis’ resignation difficult-
to understand. I ‘wish to restate
at this time the position I took
when Mr. Stern resigned the of-
ﬁce of president of SG. I believe

that one acc‘omp1ishes nothing by‘

resigning_from a position or lead-
ership in an organization. An ef-
fective leader, in my opinion,
stays with a "group and learns to
except occasional setbacks and
disapproval from his advisers and
co-workers. Helmlust continue to
lead, however, because his ab-
sence hinders the group’s actions
more than his acceptance of a
descision with which he does not
Since Mr. Urbaitis did
work so long for the publication
of an excellentstudent Directory,
I cannot. understand why he

I’
T
I

7FheIﬁl

Editor

would leave in the middle of the
sales period when students and
administrative offices still need
copies of the Directory.

Mr. Urbaitis, according to your
editorial, resigned because he un-
derstood that Mr. _Vrana wanted
him to show written proof in the
form of individual orders that he
could sell as many Directories as
he wanted to reorder. I‘ asked Mr.
Vrana if this was an accurate

 representation of his viewpoint.

He told me, in essence, that his
idea was to get a sufficient num-
ber of order blanks distributed
to the administrative and faculty

’ offices which had not received,
order blanks, and then use/these
orders as a basis for the number
of copies to be reordered in ad-
dition to any number of copies
for general sales which did not

."have to be pre-ordered on an
individual basis. _

The plan would be to get, say,
250 orders from offices, and then
add X hundred for general stu-

dent sales, with X ‘dependent on L

the Directory’s previous sales

which were very good. This plan .

would delay the sales of Direc-

tories to the student for a’ few r

days, but yet I it would‘ assure
the success of the total ﬁnancial
- position of the Directory.

I am not trying to place the
blame for the collapse of the Di-~
-rectory sales on Mr. Urbaitis
alone, but yet-Mr. Vrana should
not, as you inferred in your edi-
torial, bear the total responsibil-
ity. Admittedly, Mr. Vrana failed
to successfully get Mr. Urbaitis

to understand his position, but
this seems a small matter in com-
parsion to totally abandoning a
project of /such importance as the
Student Directory.

I am aware of Mr. Vrana’s‘

position in this dispute because
I found it hard to believe that
your editorial was an accurate

representation of the John Vrana
I know. I, therefore, talked to

John, and after talking with him,
decided to write this letter.

May I remind you, Mr. Editor,
that Mr. Vrana spent three years
working with student publica-
tions at this University. He was
both editor of the Polaris and
business manager’; of"The Owl. , M

The statement in your editori-
al, furthermore, which claimed
that John Vrana had an “out-
dated view _of administrative

omnipotence” is,‘ to me, totally‘
unrealistic and_ false. I have.’

worked _elose1y with John for the
past two‘ years. Last year, when
he was president of SG, I was a
senator, and now that he is ﬁ-
nancil adviser to SG, Ihave the
opportunity to work with him
again.

~ G Let me remind" you,  Edi-

— tor, that it was John Vrana who

fought last year for a discount

at the bookstore, eventually gain-,

ing a share of the proﬁts for
student organizations. It was
John Vrana who led ‘the admin-'
istration to accept the idea of an
activities fee. Itlwasi John Vrana,
furthermore, whobalked at the
University taking a 32 cent proﬁt

. on each athletic I.D. card sold. It

was John Vrana who started a
successful campaign to have the
University remind students ‘that
they should have their $50, ma-
triculation fee returned when
they are graduated.

It was, ﬁnally, J ohn. Vrana who
was awarded the position of 1965 ‘
Omicron Delta Kappa / Man of,
the Year for outstanding student
leadership ‘and decision-making.

involvement does not change in

Lack of Vietnam
Coverage Noted

Editor, The Pitt News: ' ‘ -
The Pitt News is .a most strik-
ing example of a university news-
paper which functions as an ex-
tension of the administration.
Throughout this trimester the

express views which are deter-
mined and enforced by the es-
tablishment of this institution.
Consciously and unconsciously
the newspaper staff demonstrates
(in both ‘editorial and news.arti-

dent repository for student opin-
ion, but rather an inseparable'
part of the power ‘structure
which pervades this University.

This sole function of the news-
paper as spokesman for the ad-
ministration has been illustrated
quite clearly by The Pitt News’
failure to report-promptly on the
Vietnam workshops which took
place Oct. 15. The presence of
newspaper reporters and photo-
graphers at that gathering was
quite obvious, so that the failure
of such an article to appear as
soon as possible after the event is
inexcusable. A

I would like to suggest that
the absence of a report on the
workshops is a result of the very

' nature of the meetings them-

selves, They afforded one of the
few opportunities on this campus
their feelings about topics which
for students publicly to express
are relevant to their daily lives.
Each of the three workshops was
characterized by an intense in-
volvement with the subjects at

‘ hand. There was little obvious

hedging on the part of the speak-
ers; their statements exuded an
honesty which was, to this ob-
server, highly refreshing.

The immediate question which
arises as a result of these work-
shops is Why such discussion does
not take place more Often and
more openly, and why The Pitt

News does not recognize the de-

sire and the .ability of the stu-
dent body to think and act in-
dependently of inﬂexible admin-
istrative control.

The Pitt News could, in theory,
serve asla vehicle for all stu-
dent feeling; as matters stand,
however, it remains utterly and
completely tied to the pronounce-
ments of an administration that
would have us believe it to be
beyond either criticism or dissert.

‘Owl’ Loses Aetna Policy;

Now Insured by University

The unsuccessful thief who
tried to break into The Owl of-
ﬁce may have been successful
in getting The Owl's insurance
cancelled.

The Sept. 15 issue of The Pitt
News contained the story and .a
picture of the attempted theft of
photographical equipment. Five
days later Mel Stein, business
manager of The 1966 Owl, re-
ceived a letter from the Wagner
Agency stating that their policy

“will expire Oct. 29” and “We
are sorry but we will be unable
to renew same.”

“I’m not sure if they are con-
nected,” Stein said. “It's possible
but I doubt it. It takes longer
than ﬁve days.”

A representative of Wagner
Agency said they are agents for
the Aetna Casualty and Surety
Company. Upon receiving notice
that Aetna wou1dn’t renew the
policy, they notiﬁed Stein.

William Shakespeare’s undiscovered epic, “Queen Alex-
andra and Murray,” was unearthed a few years ago by a
man who claimed to be 2,000 years old. Passages were
quoted, and scholars were sent to work. Subsequently, the
Onomotopaeiac Society of America camped on the site
of a Renaissance street theatre, and while digging, the
scene, a ghostly figure emerged.

_It spoke_ in a voice not unlike Margaret Rutherford’s say-
mg: “W hat ho, students! Get ye to a merchant who ped-
dles ye olde phonographe discs. Find ye my picture, and
hold it next thy books. Fame and fortune wait Without!”

Blocking End Zalnasky Enjoys the Hard Jolts

By TOM SACKS

Tight end Mitch Zalnasky
is slow for a pass catcher.
He’ll probably never break
away for the long yardage.
but in the clutch he’s the
most valuable player on the

field.

When quarterback Kenny Lu-
cas is faced with a third or fourth
down and key yardage, he looks
for Zalnasky. Those calls usually
pay dividends and after those
three or four receptions a game
Zalnasky reverts to his toughest
assignment—-that of a blocking
end.

“I’m not a runner, but I’m
strong,” said the senior end. -“I
leave it up to the Crabtrees, Lon-
gos or Rosboroughs to catch the
ball in the ﬂat and make the
long yardage. It’s my job to get
the seven or eight yarders. I’m
expected to.”

Zalnasky admits that Lucas has
made his job a lot easier this
year. Lucas ranks among the top
ten passers in the nation and
has established the Panthers as
one of the biggest offensive
threats in the country.

“He has to be .accurate when
throwing to me,” said Zalnasky.

“I can’t get behind my defender,
so Kenny always has to throw
into the crowd. And the ball is
almost always in my hands.”
Even when Lucas does go as-
tray, Zalnasky manages to come
up with the ball. It was his

fourth down, diving catch that
set up the winning touchdown
in the Oklahoma game.

Last Saturday’s newly discov-
ered running attack made Zal-
nasky’s Job as a receiving end
much easier. “It keeps the op-
ponent off balance when we can
go to the inside or outside,” he
said. “It takes a lot of pressure
off me.” ~

Zalnasky’s pass catching chores
might have been made easier

Zalnasky makes one of his four receptions in

Miami game. A clutch receiver, the senior lunges forward for ﬁrst
down yardage. He has caught 17 passes in six games.

Lies Clings To Yogi Lead
Coaches, Players Move Up

_Not only did the Panther
football team win a game
last Saturday but the two
Panther representatives in
the Yogi contest Won Week-
ly honors and moved up in
the overall standings as well.

Offensive tackle coach Dick
Mills picked 13 of 15 games to
draw the coaches to within one
game of the lead. Mills lost only
the Wake Forest win over North
Carolina and Washington's tri-
umph over Oregon.

Fred Hoaglin had a 12-3 rec-
ord to bring the players into
fourth place. The Panther center

H turned in the best showing by a

player in the contest to date.
George “Moustachio” Lies clung

' to his ﬁrst place lead by virtue

of his 9-6 slate. Both “Mousta-
chio” and Bill “The Log” Cabin,
(who was 11-4) lost a game when
Pitt topped Miami. For “The
Log,” it was the ﬁrst time that
he had picked the result of the
Pitt game incorrectly.

Jay “_F1atbush” Rosenstein be-
came a winner again at 10-5. He
picked the only real upset of the
week when he tabbed Wake For-
est to beat the Tar Heels. Frank
“Wimpy” Smizik managed an 8-7
mark. “I just have the snake
bite,” he moaned. “The teams I
pick choke in the clutch, week
after week.” .

Today marks the second ses-
sion of the Lifetime Sports
Foundation's Bowling Clinic at

You can spot Van Heusen’s
Agent 417. He has that
mysterious, casual air
women just adore. The

against Miami, but he specializes
as a blocking end and that job
was twice as tough. “Their de-
fense was expecting our power
sweeps several times and it’s
much harder to take a guy out
of a play when he’s expecting you
to hit him.”

Zalnasky actually made the job
hitting and blocking sound as if
it was more enjoyable than be-
ing a receiver. “As the blocking
end I get a chance to hit hard
and take the guy completely out
of the play. From my position I
can catch the defender in a trap
or hit him from the blind side
and really hurt him.”

Giving and taking the hard
knocks comes easy for the 6’2”,
210 pounder because he has the
desire and the conﬁdence. “It’s
not really the desire to hurt the
other guy. It comes from just
wanting to win. I feel I’m stronger
than the person I’m supposed to
box out and I want to prove it.”

Zalnasky’s conﬁdence was un-
dimmed by the beating the often-
sive unit took from Navy two.
weeks ago. “When a team stops

you cold like that it makes you '

wonder. We went into the game
expecting them to go along with
the script but they didn't. We
had our pride back for the Miami
game and Miami wasn’t that dif-
ferent than Navy.”

Even though the offensive unit
fell ﬂat against the Middies, the
defense ﬁnally fell into form and
from Zalnasky’s point of view it

_was quite a relief. “We bad faith

in the defense for the ﬁrst time
Saturday. It’s a good feeling
knowing that if you score ﬁrst
the touchdown will stand. For
once we know there's somebody
out there besides us.”

Harriers Defeat WVU Decisively;
Look Forward to Penn State Meet

By'RON SHEARER
The cross-count-ry team
ran away from the Moun-
taineers of West Virginia
last Saturday, as they posted

’ a 17-42 win. The victory was

the second of the season for

the harriers and brings their rec-

ord to 2-3, with one meet remain-
ing at Penn State.

Co-captain Dave Eichenlaub
won the race easily, while set-
ting .a new Pitt Varsity. record of
22 minutes, 3 seconds.“I' felt
as good as I ever have,” said
Eichenlaub. “I only Wish some-
one had been out there pushing
me. I thought I could break 22‘
minutes.” ‘

Howard Jackson, West Vir-,
ginia’s top runner, took fourth
place. He averted a shutout, as
the Panthers also captured sec-
ond, third, ﬁfth and sixth place.

Frank Handelman ﬁnished sec-

ond behind Eichenlaub. It was

his strongest race of the year.
‘fThere"s only one. reason for my
good ﬁnish,” was Handelman’s
comment. “I am ﬁnally starting
to round into shape. I didn’t run

enough this summer, and my run-
ning showed in the first couple
of meets. Now I feel strong and
have the necessary wind.”

Don Hinchberger took third for

the Panthers. “I felt good for the
first two miles,” said Don, “but
those last two I really had to
work.” Hinchberger passed WVU’s
Jackson early and kept ahead
the entire. race. He has never
lost to the*Mountaineer runner.

Finishing ﬁfth and sixth, re.-
spectively, were Larry Hubner
and Fran Shor. Neither thought
WVU was very strong, but they
didn’t anticipate such an easy
race.
