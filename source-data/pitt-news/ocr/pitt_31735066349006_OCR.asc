AAUP Sinks Merger Plans 

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY

Faculty-union merger plans have
been dashed following a “practi-

cally unanimous” rejection by the»

American Association of University
Professors (AAUP) of proposals to

combine forces with the other .
unions striving to represent teach-_

ing staff.

The AAUP vote came at a full
membership meeting last night in
which proposals to combine forces
from both the Pitt Professional
Unions (PPU) and the Pennsylvania
State Education Association
(PSEA) were rejected.

“It leads me to believe that their
own phone polls (PPU and PSEA),
indicate some weakness in posi-
tion. Undoubtedly, they'll arrange
a blitz, but I think we're on more
stable ground.” said AAUP Presi-
dent Seth Spaulding.

The proposals to merge stem
from movements throughout the
country to combine unionization
forces on campuses to avoid run-off
elections in which faculty have the
.option of no union.

The union election process, as
overseen by the Pennsylvania
Labor Relations Board, provides for
a primary election including the
AAUP, PSEA, PPU. and the
“no-union" option.

If no clear majority prevails, the
two leading contenders will be put
on another ballot in-a run-off
election. The no-union option
could be one of the two leading
contenders. '

According to PSEA representa-
tives Michael Butera, former
AAUP President Ray Richmond,
now on sabbatical, held private
meetings with the PSEA to talk
about a combination of forces this
summer.

“Richmond met with PSEA
leaders and attorneys to discuss a
merger. Butera said, “and we've
indicated a willingness to cooper-
ate. I think it's safe to say things
would have been different if
Richmond were still president."

PPU President Van Beck Hall 1

also noted that Richmond had
conducted meetings geared to a
combination of all three unions on

The Student Government Board
(SGB) has not completed any
substantial work so far this term,
SGB President Larry Platt said at
Wednesday night’s meeting.

“The problem of football cou-
pons came up as soon as we came
back to school this fall,” Platt said.
We have a lot of work to do, but We
haven’t been able to accomplish
much.” —

SGB member Tyrone ‘.‘Chip”
Hubbard said he and other Board
members had been working, even
if Platt had not been informed of
their accomplishments. Platt
reminded members of their duty to
report all their actions at meetings.

Platt went on to criticize absent
Board member Dan Stiﬂer for less
than adequate performance.

“Stiﬂer just seems to have
collapsed,” Platt said. “He hasn’t
reported on any of his assign-
ments.”

campus, thus insuring a unified
and stronger pro-union vote in the
face of a possible fragmentation of
faculty.

Combinations had been success-
ful in other universities, Hall
noted, particularly Northern Illinois
and Montana, where votes and
resources were pooled to lock up
the schools.‘

Without the combination there is
a possibility of fragmentation of
pro-union votes on campus, putting
a union 'movement’s chance of
success in a precarious position,
Hall noted.

“The election is going to be a
rough one now," Hall noted. “lf
it's a nasty election it might be
hard to convince the other faculty
to go along with a single union if
no union"malEes it into the run-off
vote.”

According to most sources, the
appearance of the “no-union”
option on the run-off ballot may be
an inevitability.

“Certainly it’s a set back for the
faculty," Butera commented, “but

Platt, said SGB members are

reuired to inform the Board of their

weekly activities.

“If SGB members are to received
remunerations, they’ve got to
prove they’re doing something,”
Platt explained. “If one of the
Board members isn’t putting in
enough work, we’ll try to establish
a procedure to eliminate his pay.”

Livewire: Late Fee Payment Evokes Complaint w

BY GEORGENE KALEINA

This week we'll take a look at what seems to be a
constant gripe of students-—the late fee.

A student complained over the “apparently unethical
policy of the Office of Student Accounts regarding the late
fees payment.” She said she registered in June and waited
for an invoice until August 7, when she left the country for
a vacation.

When she returned to Pittsburgh the first week of
September, she discovered the invoice had been mailed
during her absence with a due date of August 28. As a
result. she was penalized with the $25 late fee.

The student also felt it was unfair to send out invoices
late in the summer when many are on vacation. Since she
had registered so early. she could not understand why it
took so long to receive an invoice. .

On the surface, it seems justifiable that the student be
charged the late fee since she didn’t pay her tuition by the
due date. However, the question arises as to why she

.11, s.:--

received her invoice .so late in thesummer, since she had

    

 

  
 
 
 
 

According to Manager of Student Accounts James N.
Beavers, billing starts on July 17. The invoices are sent out
in groups of 4,000 to avoid long lines of students
attempting to pay. There are several billing periods with a
minimum payment time, of three weeks.

“As when we receive the registration forms, we try to
send out the billing as soon as possible,” Beavers said. ‘‘It
is imperative we do this sincethe state requires that the
University has everyone paid by the beginning of the
term." i

To check out why the student’s invoice went out so late,
we had to study her records.

Under the guidelines of the Privacy Rights of Parents .

and Students (better known as the Buckley Amendment), a
release from the student on her records was obtained. The
record veriﬁed the problem. ‘

The student had transferred from the College of Arts and
Sciences to the School of Health Related Professions. The
need for an instructor's prior permission to enter a course

"held up the registration form in the Scaife Hall Registrar's
« O.ft"1cc until August 5. '

happen, ﬁnally dashing any hopes
of a unified attempt‘ to unionize
faculty. '

Butera conceded that the na-
tional policy of his organization
prevented a merger with the PPU,
which isan AFL-CIO affiliate.

In other faculty union news, the
PPU drafted a resolution calling for
meetings with student leaders
concerning the role of students in
the academic collective bargaining
process. '
' “Ithink there is nothing unusual
about it," Hall said." “The position
of the AFL-CIO has always been
one of better support of higher
education. .

“It’s up to the student people
now. We'll have to wait their
pleasure on this.”

Student Government President
Larry Platt, one of the student
leaders who received the resolution
Tuesday, said he was waiting for
action from the other unions
involved. .

_“I think it's good that a union
has recognized the place and
concern of students in the collective
bargaining process,” Platt said.
‘~‘and I'd like to see the other
unions respond on this matter.”

Both the PSEA and the AAUP '

stressed their historical commit-
ment to student participation in
union negotiations, although Bu-

tera said he forsees problems with.’ '.

participation.

“Frankly I can’t see students
sitting at the table. It's quite all
right to endorse their presence, but
I’m afraid problems will come up as

to how they will be represented," _

Butera said.

No formal resolution has been
drafted by either the PSEA or the
AAUP concerning student partici-
pation. -

(Continued from Page 1)

Platt usually assigns projects to
the Board members, but seldom is
a deadline set for their completion.

In other action, the Board
unanimously passed a motion
declaring disapproval of Vice
Chancellor for Student Affairs
Alfred Moye’s proposal to remove
pinball machines from the Towers
lobby.

“Moye’s being ridiculous
again,” Platt said. “He complains
about ‘undesirables’ using the
machines. The only undesirable
thing I see around campus is the
way arbitrary decisions are thrown
right at the students.”

Platt stated that Moye does not
listen to student complaints.

“Moye feels that any student
leader who ‘disagrees with him is
‘illegitimate,’ ” Platt said.

“The matter of the pinball
machines may seem minor, but it
shows how decisions are not being
made in the best student interest

’  _anymore. ’ ’

Pitt's Public Relations Com-

brochure‘ with a breakdown of the
student activities fees, explaining
how the funds are being spent,
Platt reported. '

“There will be a pie diagram

showing how much money is being
allocated to different student
activities,” Platt said. There will
also be a chart showing how much
money each student organization
requested, and how much money
was actually allocated to each
group, according to Platt.

“There may also be an analysis
of some of the questions confront-
ing student government in deciding
how to allocate funds,” Platt
added. “It is up to us to decide
which organizations are most
important to students.”

A leisure learning center in the

at the meeting.

Registration for classes in such

Tarnock. Lorraine Schmidtt is the

News analysis

Lax Leade

-\3—_ BY GENE GRABOWSKI

In the light of recent events, it

looks as though Pitt students may

be losing a lot of their privileges"

often as a result of less than
diligent student leaders.

When administrators announced
plans to implement the coupon
exchange system for home football
tickets at the beginning of the
term, the student leaders, follow-
ing the mandate of their constitu-
ency, vehemently opposediit. But
‘the furor lasted little more than a
week.

After calling for the resignation

, of Athletic Director Casimir Mys-
lﬁkﬁlinski, demanding to receive all
remaining Notre Dame tickets and
asking for a_ guarantee for free
student entry into the stadium next
year, the leaders retreated when
the Chancellor and Athletic Direc-

, tordenied the requests in formal

statements.

Though the leaders perhaps
were satisﬁed at the increase in
free student seats granted by
Myslinski, the coupon system went
into effect with no major changes.

Student leaders apparently
claimed half a victory and went
back to overdue schoolwork.

At Wednesday’s Student Gov-
ernment Board meeting, SGB

=’;.,(Pi‘esident Larry Platt chastised

 Board members for slacking off in
their work.

Each week, the Board members
who are working on projects seem
to repeat the progress reports of
previous meetings.

have been sparsely attended by the
leaders. The first and second
sessions were attended by ten and
seven student representatives res-»
pectively. Only the initial
emergency session on September 5_
saw all 22‘members present.
Student leaders apparently canft
ﬁnd the necessary time to maintain

and protect their rights _and-

privileges.

Yet, perhaps time is the most
important element for student
representatives.

It takes time to battle an
administration that can spend eight
hours and more each day on
projects that sometimes infringe
upon student rights.

In effect, it takes diligent
students who must often forego

days of assignments just to be good

student leaders.

' Perhaps, then, it is too much to
ask student representatives’ to
jeopardize their academic careers
by spending” so much time on
extracurricular activities.

It seems clear that token student
representation enhances the image
of the administration and provides
valuable out-of-the-classroom ex-
perience for students.

Effective student representation,
though, may hurt both sides. The
administration may complain of
outrageous student demands and
the students may worry about

neglected academic workloads‘

when the issues become hot.
Most recently, Vice Chancellor
for Student Affairs Alfred Moye
strongly suggested that the pinball
machines in the Towers Lobby be
removed because of their attraction
of “undesirable” elements there.

_bility to deal with the quality of life ‘

rs Lose Rights

The Resident Student Associa-
tion (RSA) under Jim Datovech
strongly opposed this recommen-
dation. claiming there was no
specific evidence of the machines’
attraction to the unwanted ele-
ment. -

Moye said it was his responsi-

in the residencehalls. 5

“I will not abdicate this
responsibility to the RSA,” Moye
-said. '

In this instance, the leaders of
the Towers residents may not have
a say in the control of their
environment--unless they find the
time.

Underground gParking”‘i., 
  Plan May BeAxed   

(Continued from Page 1)
special assistant to the Chancellor,
the recommendation to drop the
project is still under consideration.

The original plan for the
underground lot was suggested by

~Ramp Consulting Services, Incor-

porated, in a $14,000 feasibility

 study prepared for -the Public

Parking Authority of Pittsburgh six
months ago.

Thereport evaluated the results
of several field parking studies
conducted in 1973. According to
Ramp, there are three alternatives
in the size of the proposed lot. A
site with a capacity of 320 cars was
estimated tocost over $4 million; a
670-car lot, $6.4 million; A and a
921-car facility, $8.6 million.

The Parking Authority has

. indicated that their final preference

would be~a 600-car
said.

Ramp’s study shows the cost per
parking space in a 600-car garage,
based on the over-all cost figures,
would have to average about 50
cents per hour.

Presently, the hourly cost of a
metered space in the Schenley lot is
20 cents.

“This (50 cents per hour) means
that the average cost for a
commuter would be close to $2 a
day for parking," Roling ex-
plained.

Ramp’s report also indicates that
78% of the commuters who use the
Schenley lot are students.

The committee bases its recom-
mendation on the belief that this
charge would not be practical,
consideringthe weekly budget of
an average student commuter.

The poor performance of the current Student Government Board
(SGB) seems to stem from a variety of ills. 7
.l'*irst,therennybeasenseofdefeatismsincetheBoard,and

. - consequently Pitt students, haven’t won any of the nmjor issues before
 theminthisadministration. .

T “START-UP,” the lobbying drive to increase the amount of Pitt aid
from Harrisburg, was a failure in the minds of legislators. And Pitt
students received nothing for their efforts.

The University throughout what became known as the tuition crisis

‘A - sat tight and notiﬁed the SGB of program cuts and a possible tuition
hike. The SGB, in trying to learn if cuts would be justiﬁed, sought
access to the University’s level-one budget to compare the

» ‘appropriations for other University flmctions. The Board never got a
‘ look at the level-one, and students were slapped with a tuition
increase.

The latest cause for disillusionment has been the new football"
.ticket-distribution plan, which students,  particularly the SGB,
have called unnecessary and lacking in student input. After a list of

T demands that included the resignation of the athletic director, students.
once more were left holding the bag. '

Another cause of the Board’ s lack of effectiveness is poor individual
performance of Board members. Over the summer one member was
given an ultimatum by the rest of the Board to either mend his ways or

important thing is that both union

Both groups would have perhaps
the most import’ant reason to settle

  This Way and That Way

BY JOHN METCALFE

It has been my habit in past columns to point out
examples of idiocy that we are all likely to encounter,
and which are likely to drive us to the condition of
babbling idiots. A remarkablenumber of my earlier
examples. were found right here within the
University, though a good supply came from city,
state and other government bodies.

Here are some more. Mostof them are ours.

We are the sponsors of a young man from
Vietnam. He was a student before the‘ war interfered
and he was drafted. He was a citizen and a soldier of
the Republic of Vietnam while we supported it. He is
presently a civilian refugee, living in Pittsburgh after
four months ‘in_ a detention camp in central
Pennsylvania. He wanted to return to school; we
were chosen as his sponsors because we had said we
might be of assistance to a student. Our commitment
extends only to room and board. Indeed, it is only a
“moral" commitment, so we are not compelled to do
anything. 0 ‘

We have tried, as if we had to. Our new friend
found a job, and we tried to get himinto Pitt. We
managed, but not by much. T Registration for CAS
was closed, /of course. People who have been in
transit or in detention last spring and summer should
not expect special treatment. T

We went to the School of General Studies, and
there we were welcome. Acceptance and registration
took only an afternoon.

The advisors did just what a naive person might
expect all advisors to do; they took the time to learn
the elient’s educational background and tried to place
him in courses that would-be both useful to the
student and within his abilities. Easy on the English,
for instance, for non-native students, and heavy on

‘the math for the former engineering student.

That was good, but that was not all. A Mr. F rink,
the only person I will name here, helped us to fill out
an application for the Basic Educational Opportunity -
Grant. He is the only person I mention by name
because he is of that small fraternity of people who
help always and harm never. _ ‘ _

Things went slowly, except for a little shuffling of
courses and the usual tie-ups in the bookstore, until
the dreaded invoice arrived. It bore a due date of
September 17. It arrived on September 13, almost
perfect except for a misspelling of the student’s
surname. . ' 0

The BEOG had produced no results as yet. The
tuition was, of course, charged at the out-of-state
rates. The Department of Health, Education and
Welfare’ has directed the several states to grant
resident status to this most recent group of refugees,
but the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has chosen
not to act. In the absence of advice from their betters
in the state legislature, the administrators of the
University of Pittsburgh have chosen not to act.

This will go on. _ . .

We went to the University withthe invoice, as the
invoice itself directed, i-n order to seek a deferment of
thebill untilwe knew when the grant from BEOG
would be availablef. We were sent from the basement
of the Cathedral over to the office of Student Aid, on
the sixth -floor of Schenley Hall.

We were sent back to the basement of the
Cathedral.

We were sent back to Student Aid.

We were told to go back to the Cathedral.

I finally grew angry, and perhaps rude. I asked the
young woman who had just suggested that we go
across Bigelow Boulevard yet again whether she had
any reasons to believe that we would find any help
there. “No," she said, but she did not know what
else to do with us. As we did not have a confirmation
of the federal grant, she could not authorize an

— extension. Without an authorization from her office,

the office of Student Accounts could not issue a
deferment.

‘These trips back and forth across the Boulevard
consumed a couple of days, as we were all obliged to

goongwith the ordinaries of life. and go to classes.‘
-and to work.» and the like: ‘T ’ ’ '

At last it was the day after the due date on the A
invoice. .l was inclined to be both desperate and ,_

ext.‘

i It‘ l'J

~ . W ,.‘3l.9Tl‘.:..o?l.‘f+':1il1'E,"‘.‘.~‘-”

l was desperate because, after the due date on his
invoice, a student, if he has not paid, is likely to learn
that the computer has removed his name from the
roll of students. T

If he is removed from that honorable roll because
he has no evidence that he will receive a student

grant, he has a new problem. As he is no longer a 

student, he is no longer eligible for any student
grant. '

The neatness of all this inspired me. We would
change our tactics. So -far, we had been dealing with
secretaries, clerks and receptionists, the sort of
people who are rarely invited to make policy, but are
"expected to implement it. We_would try to meet the
policy-makers.

This is not easy. Policy-makers, as a group, have
one thing in common beside their manufacture of

’ edicts; they are without exception insulated from the

victims of theirdecisions. It is "difficult to find out
who these people are, and nearly impossible to see
them if you have somehow learned their identiies.

There is no point in cursing the clerk who tells you

that you are no longer a student. She has no choice in

the matter, and could do little to help you" if she

wanted to. However, it may be useful to annoy her (I x 

say “her" because, here at Pitt, the men who make
policy all seem to use women as their first line of
defense) to the point that she calls on her supervisor
for assistance. ‘

That supervisor, after hearing you shriek for as
long as is bearable, may then call in at least a
sub~head of the department.

I did this in the office of Student Aid, and got to
meet a man who was introduced as being in charge.
He regretted that he could do nothing, that he could
under no circumstances recommend that a deferment
be granted without having seen evidence that federal
money was on the way. He mentioned that
University funds might have been available, but that
we had failed to apply for them in time. He
Trecornmended that we observe the time limits for
application for aid for next semester. .

We will be careful not to be in government camps 

in October. .

So we went back to the Cathedral. There we went
through the same procedure of annoying and
exhausting the hired help until we met the man in
charge (again I must say “man.” The makers of
policy here that we met have all been white men of
respectable middle age). This one was a prince. He
listened politely to our tale of having been shuttled
from .theStudent Union to the Cathedral and back
like some mad horizontal yoyo, and expressed his
sympathy. He went on to consider our predicament.

It was too bad, he said, but nothing could be done.
Without a paper from Student Aid, or some evidence
that there would indeed be a grant, he could ‘not
grant an extension. ’

“l have a responsibility’ to the University," he.

-s said, and later, “What if thisbecomes a bad debt?"

He had a‘ point. .1 was unable to guarantee

inspired the administrator to his greatest effort.

“If I make an exception for him, it will be unfair to
everybody else,” he said.

And here we are. We are about to lose it all, and
we have just talked with the men who claim to be in
charge. ‘

They must be much smaller wheels in this

' wretched machine than they imagine and claim

themselves to be. They are impotent; they are
eunuchs. Not one of them has the authority to act as
anything other than a transmitter of somebody else's
paperwork. lf they have the authority, they lack the

thcy\fear the thrill of actually acting.

In all of this there is only one real victim. I am not

~j3j1§ie table and shoes on the kids’

feet, and paying taxes through the’

The under.-30 is and over-60 s

BY GEORGE DULL

There are two groups within the
student community at Pitt that
deserve constant scrutiny. Those
peer groups, in years, are students
under the age of 30 and those 60
and over. I am excluding the
30-to-()0 group because, generally,
those people are supporting the
other two groups, and who cares
where the money comes from
except, perhaps, the chancellor and
the bursar?

'" More to the point is where the
money goes. The 30-to-60 bunch is
ureoccupied with keeping food on

nose. When, in 1954, the income-
tax withholding system became a
reality, Uncle Sam and all
Iegislating bodies decreed that
“through-the nose” payment of
taxes would be mandatory

throughout the then 48 states, and

the foundation was laid for the era,

of affluence and the Age of the
Ripoff.

Our Pitt peer groups under
discussion aren’t too much in-
volved in contributing to the public
purse. They are involved in using
the public purse and this is as it
should. be. Consideration for the

ﬁiaccumulated national debt should-
‘stfaffect our first age group, whereas

our second group, the “Geronts,”
somewhat blithely can forget it.
Another reason for omitting the
30-to-60 gang is,'perhaps, the most
urgent reason of all--it represents
within our frames of reference
either parents or. children and
should be dismissed from mind.
Children never behave the .way
parents think they should, and
parents, if they are wise, will never
behave the way their children think
they should.
Both parents and children can be
pains in the ass. Parents want their

/»x_male children to take baths and

Wm

45/ c‘ ildren want their parents to have

dignity--both behaviors not 'only
improbable but maybe unhealthy.
If people in the under-30 group
get out of hand, that is if they
behave in an unexpected manner,
they get sent to jail or to rehab
centers. If people in the over-60
group get out of hand, or threaten
to, they get sent to family
I physicians, to hospital emergency
rooms. or, and this is a fate worse
than death, to Senior Citizen
Centers--the absolute end of the
line. ‘

 

In a sense the University is a
rehab center for both groups--and
that is the ‘way it should be,
sociolctgically speaking.

The conditions and the rationale
under which Senior Citizen Centers
presently function are deplorable.
They exist as mere stopping"-off
places on the way to the graveyard
or the crematorium. Last summer,
and it took a psych major to come
up with this, the South Side Senior
Citizens Center,-for a brief period,
or until threatened with a punch in
the nose, proudly noted at the
entrance [ Dante turned over in his
grave] ~“Don’t be afraid of death,
it’s natural."

Socially, we should have a group
of aging people we could call the
Senile Delinquents. It would be a
happy _ group, not given to A
vandalism, etc., but rather dedi-
cated to happily remaining young
and active. "

-. . .;..'.r.'-» ' '1:

In short, go to hell and jump on a
PAT bus, use their wisdom, and go
to Pitt and register as students. If
Missie or Junior doesn't like the
frosh beanie on grandpa’s head or
grandma's hotpants, too bad!

The University may present a few
hazards for the Geronts. For
instance, there are teachers within
the University faculty whobelieve
that senility is a disease and I can
produce a paper to prove this.

2,000, I intend to be as high as a

L Living on the Outer Fringe

There are MDs equally deluded,
but then most of them graduate
from med school in a fugue state.
The American Psychiatric Associ-
ation would be happy to insert
senility into its diagnostic manual
as a disease and again, this would
provide the shrinks with another
excuse for their existence.

The case is,_ senility is not a
disease. Once, historically, witch-
ery was a disease, homosexuali/ty
was a disease. The current disease
is alcoholism and it's paying the
way for many a clinic and hospital
floor. Now, some smartiepants PhD
is going to redefine thestate of
senility as a disease. These
know-it-alls should consult their
dictionaries--Webster, Oxford .or
Dorland's. ’ A

The truth is, senility is a state that
can be induced in teenagers. The
technique, the propaganda used, is
simply isolation and alienation. I
see daily many adolescents walking
around Pittsburgh, slack-jawed and
usually with transistor radios
slapped against their ears who are
already older than I‘ shall ever be. I
intend to reach the centure mark

 and still not suffer from sociologi-

cally induced disease redeﬁned as
senility just‘because it suits the
fancy of some elite group to make it
that. P .

When, at the age of 60, the old

- folks choggie off to the university
‘ and enter the freshman class, they

are demonstrating a y.outhfuIness
the world has‘ never seen before
and the other student group, the
under-30_ gang, apparaently wel-
comes them. These oldies are

Editor’s note: This is the first in

 , a series of articles dealing with the
7 . educational experience at Pitt as

seen through the eyes of 10

' freshman students. Throughout

‘the year the Pitt News will be in
contact with the same 10 freshmen
their

' changing attitudes and perceptions
on life at Pitt.

_ Double-digit inflation, economic
forecasts and th'e spiraling cost of
college education aside, most Pitt
freshmen are swarming to the big
city in hopes of ﬁnding a job there
when they graduate.

That,-at least, is the indication
after talking to them at the
beginning of their f1r_st.term.

No one, it seems, comes to

V college to fool around or lie low any
more. Not one freshman screened
for study criticized the govern-
ment, railed against social injustice
or even uttered an obscene word.

All in all, today's freshman crop
seems a fairly sedate one, bent on

“ : only one objective--grabbing a job.

j The social lure of the urban
campus took a poor second place
behind the dollar sign with this
- year’s freshmen.

Every new student chosen for
scrutiny said the city was a ﬁne
place to get an education, because
of both the proximity. to job
connections and the social oppor-

« tunities.
All planned, career-oriented

Socially, Penny intends to look
into sororities and Pitt's vocal
groups.

She has no real idea of what to
expect academically ' from Pitt,
although she anticipates a lot of
study.

Another commuter, John Colo-
simo of the South Hills, is one of
two engineers in the group. Many
of his friends, he reported, went to

Pitt and told him it was a good _

school.

John will hold a part-time job at
least through the first term, but he
wants to participate as much as
possible in school activities.
Int-ramural sports are especially
attractive to him. '

He wasaccepted at Penn State to
study engineering, but chose Pitt
because commuting proved less
expensive.

Jack McElewee of Hatboro, Pa.,
plans to study engineering, but he
may consider medicine. Either
one, he said. offers good job
opportunities.

None of his friends or relatives
went to Pitt, but a friend of Jack's
father recommended Pitt as a good
engineering school. He turned
to study at the
University of Miami in Florida
because it was too far away, and at
Penn State because too many
familiar faces would surface there.

An athlete, Jack may try out for
Pitt’s varsity baseball team or play
intramural sports.

Over-all, Jack said the people at
Pitt were overwhelmingly friendly.
The school in the city is J ack’s ideal
learning situation.

One other Hatboro native is
included in the study. Dave
Kirshner is somewhat of a rare
bird--the kind review boards are
wont to call well-rounded. He
Dlans to be an English major in
premed.

Dave’s brother is a product of
Pitt’s Graduate School of “Business
and he’s heard both good and bad
about the school and the city.

The worst he’s heard concerns
the fraternities, staunchy profes-
sors and the jungle of red tape
awaiting him. The best, he said
simply. concerns the career pro-
grams.

‘‘I chose Pittsburgh because
there are a lot of people here,"
Dave said, “and especially because
of all the hospitals located in this
area--they'll provide a lot of job

Dave chose Pitt over Penn and
Penn State, because he wanted to
live far from home in .a big city.
To him, a large urban university
like Pitt offers a great deal of social
opportunities both in and around
the school. .
Pitt snatched Kris Fairbanks

from the arms of Penn State. She’s_

from State College, Pa.

Originally from New England,
Kris has lived in a rural
atmosphere all her life, and so a
change of pace in coming to Pitt
seemed in order.

She's the only one of the group

who plans to study nursing here,
but like all the rest, a job is the
primary goal of her four years
spenthere at Pitt.

Also like the others, she expects
a lively social-‘life at Pitt due to its
location and number of students.

Bill Skidmore of Mount Pleasant,
will be a predcntal student: His
sister graduated last year from
Pitt’s dental hygiene program and
Bill said she recommended the
University highly.

The biggest advantages in going
to Pitt, according to Bill, are the

separation from close parental ties

and preparation for life on his own.

Bill said he also like the anongmity
nc Will have in a school as large as
Pitt.

While he expects difficult work
in his course of study, Bill also
mentioned that “there's never a
dull moment" in an
university and that he expected
much excitement here at Pitt.

ln a sense, Bill is the person
closest to being a holdover from the
sixties among the freshmen inter-
viewed. There’s a glint of serious
“party” in his eye, though he’s
just a first termer, and one easily
can get a sense that his dentistry
career was more than strongly
planned and suggested by his
family. It may take a lot of

. fortitude, but Bill could develop
, into a college bum.

Pitt was the second choice school
behind Ohio State for Cindy
Gangone of Derry, Pa., but Pitt’s
ncarness to home turned out to be a
bigger factor than she originally
expected. V

"I've heard both good and bad
things about Pitt." she said, “but
the main. thing is that it's got a
good program. for my career,
pharmacy."

Cindy said she doesn’t know
many students yet, but she could
look into sorority life.

A special
recruiters must be added here:
Grab Cindy Gangone! She's a
natural sorority girl if ever there
was one. She's the best dresser of
the group, and her teeth are all
straight. And she knows how to act
shy without being so.

She said she was glad of Pitt’s
location in the middle of the city,
because that way (ho-hum) there’s
always something to do. That
phrase must be in a handbook
somewhere.

student from 'McKeesport, Pa.,

Pitt’s difficult courses.

This girl can't help but succeed.
She'll be out to embarass more
than a few sleepy seniors in
Chemistry 999.

She said she knew sophomores
and seniors at Pitt who recommen-
ded the school to her.

Beyond the three Rs, Judy
expects a radical and stimulating
social change here at Pitt.
Especially because it’s in the

middle of the city, Pitt offers her
many cultural enjoyments not
available elsewhere.

Judy's also hoping to try out for
gymnastics.

Joe Roberts’ father went to Pitt,
so that's almost enough said for
him.

He plans to tackle either premed
or physical therapy at Pitt. “Either
way,” he said, “the medical field is
wide open.” He later added he
might go out for wrestling if time

permitted.

Joe hails from Punxsutawney
and so it was natural for him to be
somewhat awed by the city.
Pittsburgh parties and buses
seemed to thrill him the most. I
guess after a life where waiting for
a groundhog to show up is the thrill
of the year. it's easy to put parties
and buses in the same class. I
didn't argue.

She doesn't like the immense

A message for the inﬂuencers:

Today, millions of people who have never had a course in econom-
ics are influencing the structure of our economic system by their
action, or inaction. Yet the well-being of each individual and family‘
depends on sound economics. Realizing that “the doctor” needs to

know “the patient”, The Business Roundtable is sponsoring mes-
sages that discuss inner workings of ourAmerican economic system.

They are giving this special “mini course” monthly exposure be- ‘
fore the country's largest reading audience in Reader’s Digggt,

  Free    
Enterprise-
 lsThis
Any Way

,,to Live? ,,

VERY TIME you pick up a
paycheck, buy a gallon of
gas or make a bank de-
posit, you renew your ac-

tive membership in the American

free market. Our economic system’s -

almost infinite freedom of choice-
between house and condominium,
one supermarket and another, large
car and small—is the “humdrum”
reality of the highest standard of
living in the world.

And yet a vocal group of econo-i

mists, social reformers, “consumer
advocates” and other self-proclaimed
critics are trying ' to convince us
that our system is evil, that‘ we
should feel guilty about the way we
live. Indeed, one of them says that
our system “has issued a death sen-
tence against the ‘individual human
spirit” and “plunged our country
into its present economic chaos, de-
stroyed the lives of millions of fam-
ilies and threatened the very survival
of the republic.”

Strong stuff. But is it even partial-
ly true? Maybe it’s time to remind
ourselves of afew facts as we con-
sider the following charges against
,our way of life: A

-0 Free enterprise exploits people.
The critics say that the system de-
grades man, making him a cog in
the industrial machine, _repressing
his individualism. Yet how can they
reconcile this darkly tinted 19th-
century view with the Pittsburgh
steelworker who hitches his motor-

boatto his new car and heads for .
his cottage on Deep Creek Lake,

Md., on summer weekends, or the
machine operator in Dayton who
rises to plant manager? The view is
hardly compatible with the fact that
median family real income (ﬁgured
in constant dollars) has nearly
trebled since 1939. Nor does it jibe
with polls showing that Americans
8 to I like theirjobs.

0 The free enterprise system
makes I us_ selfish and materialistic.
No one do,ubts"that our economic
system has produced an extraordi-

nary abundance of material goods. »

And it is true that “average "Ameri-
cans” spend nearly half their total
income on what they want (the
other half takes care of necessities-
food, clothing, housing). No people
have ever lived so comfortably. But
the record indisputably shows that,
even as they have enjoyed and in-
sisted upon material benefits, they

have poured out much of their

material wealth unselfishly. In 1965,
for example, we gave $12.2 billion to
churches, hospitals, schools and a
dizzying variety of charitable causes.
Last year, despite recession, we gave
$25.2 billion, a seven-percent jump
over 1973.

And we give of our time, too—-
much of that time free because of
material things that ' shorten our
working hours at home and on the
job. We compose an army of 37 mil-
lion volunteers-hospital workers,
Little Leaguecoaches, den mothers,
helping hands for the elderly and the
retarded. The world's most material-
ly wealthy society has brought a pe-

culiarly vital effectiveness to the
concept of volunteerism.
, 0 Our way of life debases our
taste..The critics picture us as help-
less slaves to manufacturers, addicted
-to a stream of frivolous products put
out purely fbr proﬁt. But if we don’t

~ want such products,,we don’t‘buy

them. The choice is ours.

Critics also blame the system for
the fact that some of us persist in cat-
ing “junk food” or listening to
"awful noise” on the radio. They're
afraid that we'll make the “wrong”
choice between wool and nylon,
pretzels and carrot cookies. Yet the
very genius of the market enables us
to make such choices freely and in
abundance. “Indeed,” notes econo-
mist Milton Friedman, “a major
source of objection to a free economy
is precisely that it does this task so
well. It gives people what they want
instead of what a particular group
thinks they ought to want. Underly-
ing most arguments against a free
market is a lack of belief in freedom
itself.” ‘

0 Free enterprise concentrates
wealth and power in the hands of a
few. In no other society is -wealth so
obviously in reach of its people. The
Bureau of Census reports 59.2 per-
cent of national income goes to the
103 million people in families mak-
ing $10,000 to $25,000. More signifi-

cant, in 1962 there were 464,000
households making over $25,000. By
1973, there were 5.4 million such
households—a more than tenfold
increase—-astounding even when in-
ﬂation is taken into account. One in-

dicator of how wealth is distributed

‘in America: two out of every three
families own or are purchasing the
dwelling in which they live.

Well, then, say the critics, wealth
and power mustbe in the hands of
big corporations. But who are these
corporations? They are more than
31 million Americans who own cor-
porate stock, plus more than 100
million others who indirectly share
in ownership through stock owned
by life-insurance companies, pension
funds, etc.

Says economist Charls Walker, “I
know it's fashionable to say that the

 

biginterests run the government.
But if that’s true, how in the world
were the taxes of ‘big interests’ raised
by $6.5 billion -in the 1969 Tax Re-
form Act? And why haven’t those
‘big interests’ prevented the passage
of inimical regulatory acts?” Be-
cause the people—who run the
marketplace—still run the country.

PERI-IAPS you've noticed that the case
against the free market is seldom
made on hard economic grounds,

but rather on hard-to—pin-down phil—  '

osophical issues.'That’s because the
facts of performance are so over-
whelmingly in its favor.

Here are some ﬁgures: With seven
percent of the world’s_.land area and
six percent of the population, we
produce 33 percent of the world’s
goods and services (about equal to
the total output of Western Europe

and Japan combined). Although our '

labor force is approximately two-
thirds the size of the Soviet Union’s,
we produce twice as much as’ the
Russians do each year. In 1940, one
American farm worker fed about

ten people. «Today, a single Ameri-

can farm worker feeds 54 people here
and abroad.

But all the evidence of the sys-

, .

tem s well-known efficiency and
productivity is ultimately not as im-
portant as a certain intangible that
looms larger than mere economics.

This is the subtle blend of freedom

and order inherent to.the market— . '

place. You are free to decide how best
your skills can be applied, "where
you will work, what you will buy
with your earnings. Can you imag-
ine some central authority deciding
who will be a tool-and—die maker in
Latrobe, Pa., or a vacuum-cleaner
repairman in Keokuk? The free
market monitors an incredibly com-

plex assortment of prices, wages,‘

resources, skills, needs, desires——and
yet it leaves you in control.

element to convey, Bates advised.

As in everything, an interviewee
should be prepared, he said.
Preparation takes introspection on
strengths, weaknesses and accom-
plishments.

A job seeker should be prepared
to name a few college classes he
found particularly interesting, and
be able to list reasons why, other
than the fact the professor had a
fascinating accent.

Knowledgeé of the company and
what is available there is some
thing else interviewers look for. If

he spent enough time looking into -

the ﬁrm, it can be assumed the
person is interested.

The interviewee shouldn’t get
hung up on negatives, such as bad
grades or lack of experience, but
rather should concentrate on
positives and assume the negatives
are all behind. _

Honesty, he stressed, is noticed
and noted.

Professional personnel
interviewers ask two.-part ques-
tions, hoping to see if the
prospective employee answers both
sides clearly, or answers just one
and‘ overlooks the second.

The Resume

BY MAGGIE MCKAY

As part of the careers seminar,
Ray Oyler, new associate director
of the University's Placement
Center, spoke on the topic of “How
to Write a Resume."

The following is a summary of
the important points in his speech.

A resume should never be sent
without a cover letter which:

--Conveys who you are.

--Shows your desire for
interview.

If possible, direct the cover letter
to a specific person. [Never “To
Whom It May Concern.”] If you do
not know the name of a specific
person, direct the letter to the
college placement director. Above
all, keep the letter brief and
concise.

Temple Trio Keeps Cozy

BY PAMELA EUSI

Believe it. or not, there are
certain advantages to chamber
music over music played by a
symphony orchestra. One is case
in rehearsal. Another is the ability

.. ¢_:._f,orm a more cohesive music-_
"~»y'v¥’oducing medium. Still another is

that when a small group is
performing, one is able _ to
concentrate in the individual
members of that group.

Anyone attending the free
concert Wednesday night featuring
the Temple University Trio knows
what I’m talking about.

The Trio is comprised of
Alexander Fiorillo, piano; Helen
Kwalwasser, violin; and Michael
Haran, cello.

As a whole the Trio is a very
precise unit with a good idea of
what direction it wants the music to
take. The conditions in the Frick
Fine Arts Auditorium were very

‘S-(T-"?'nductive to this type of music-
‘niaking and knit the audience

together into a closer, cozier group.

The musicians opened with the
“Trio in C Minor, Opus 1, No. 3”
by Beethoven. Trio was of the
well-known Beethoven style, that
:of brilliant frenzy.

Actually its not frenzy, but
calculated ferocity, that makes‘
Beethoven so revolutionary. No

one up to his time had quite that
much ferocity in his music and still
came out smelling like an estab-
lished genius. '

Pitt to Host
Jazz Seminar

  InC)ciober

Pitt will host on October 9-11 its
ﬁfth annual Seminar on Jazz for
professional
musicians, and students.

Among the jazz figures serving A

as seminar faculty will be: Jaki
Byard [piano], Kenny Burrell
[guitar], Richard Davis [bass],
Leonard Feather [critic, historian,
author, and musician], Louis Hayes
[percussion], Joe Henderson [tenor
saxaphone and arranger], Lou
Soloff [trumpet], and Sonny Stitt
[alto and tenor saxophone]. The
Celestial Sounds, a gospel group
from Washington, DC, will also
make an appearance, as well as a
large contingent of Pittsburgh-
based jazz musicians.

The seminar director is Nathan
Davis, jazz saxophonist, and
assistant professor of music at Pitt.
__ The purpose islto determine

etter methods of teaching jazz, to
assist high schools and colleges in
preparing jazz curriculums, and to
aid individual study through the art
of performance.

Music from the entire spectrum
of jazz styles and colors will
support the informal seminar
sessions; also, the contributions of
Sonny Stitt will be honored with a
special presentation.

The entire three-day seminar will
culminate with a jazz concert
featuring the gathered talents of
the invited faculty. led by Davis.

The fifth annual Jazz Seminar is
made possible by grants. ‘coopera-
tion, and support from Student
the Student Union
Board. the Gulf Oil Corporation,
the School of General Studies,
Pitt's music department, and the

styles. Haran provided a substan-
tial amount of rhythm in this heavy
piece.

The second movement was
especially beautiful in its serene
mood and provided a good contrast
to the rumblings of the first
movement. Fiorillo’s piano seemed
to be an especially encouraging
agent in this nlovement.

Tender, graceful motions, reca-/

pitulation ot earlier themes and
rich developments characterized
the last two movements.

Mostfmusical groups like to
include an old standard along with
a contemporary work and another
piece of a different nature. The
contemporary work was “Trio” by
Piston, written in 1935.

As I suspected, the piece started
out true to modern form, with
unusual intervals and basically
dissonant chords. But soon I was
pleasantly surprised, as I discover-
ed that “Trio” had a definite
emotional appeal--not in the way of
the romantic Romantic works of the
nineteenth century but an emo-
tional appeal going “back to the
basics.” It was the kind of music
that grows on you.

Nixon Reopens

BY DAVID ASHLEY

The Nixon Theatre, which has
been closed for _some time,
reopened for business this week
with a champagne reception in the

The piano kept repeating pound-

ing rhythms to various violin and

cello decorations. Then the mood
changed and the accompaniment
changed along with it to one of
simple chords, so A as not to
complicate the sobbing melodies of
the cello. ' «

A dramatic build or two," a few

_tricky double stops and a large ‘
amount of gusto made the rest of

the piece a shining display of trio
ﬁnesse. ,, _

Ravel’s “Trio in A Minor” was
the last selection. It began in a
dreamy, impressionistic way, with

Kwalwasser leading off and Haran"

echoing her lead. The work
sounded almost like something
from Debussy, with some ﬂoating
violin parts and a luxuriant piano
background.

Later the piano repeated the ﬁrst
theme while the violin and cello
added their own special embellish-
ments for a striking combination.

After one’s attention was fo-
cused on a set of pizzieato attacks,
great style and sweeping gestures
made the second movement quite
interesting.

The number “Cool, Cool, Con-
siderate Men." sung by the

conservative faction, is precise and
rhythmic and set to a very formal
choreography based on a courtly
dance. The closed gyrations, which

light probing the skies above
Pittsburgh, and red, white and blue
lights in the orchestra pit.

The National Touring Company’s
presentation 01 11/0, a musical
interpretation of the Congressional
events leading up to the signing of
the Declaration of Independence,
launches a four-month ‘season
designed to test the current
viability of the old playhouse.

The show, produced and directed

A by Anthony Doren, is a competent

but necessarily unrewarding rendi-
tion of a musical comedy ‘that
barely manages to extract itself
from consistent mediocrity. As
1776 contains at best a couple of
Sherman Edwards numbers that
are not instantly and happily
forgettable, the musical impact of
the show is somewhat limited.
Not only doithe show tunes lack
any intrinsic merit, but for the most
part they enjoy a separate and
colorless existence, without com-
plementing the substance of the

play. There are a few exceptions to‘, 
vcr, and Dor, n3 is able‘ to 

his, howe _

     

 

are traced out in this number,
reflect the circular logic implicit in
the lyrics. The interpenetration
between style and substance that
works very well here is absent
elsewhere, and to be fair to Doren,
the most that could be expected of
Edwards’ music is that it be
churned out as smoothly and as
painlessly as possible.‘ ,

From the initial semi-operatic
“For God’s Sake John; Sit Down,"
to the gratuitous and pathetic,
putatively "anti-war ballad,
“Mama. Look Sharp," any con-
nection between the dramatic
script and the musical numbers is
hard to make. By the end of the
evening. one is sufficiently nervous
to anticipate the Jeffersonian
assertion: “When in the course of
human events..." to be merely the
cue for yet another superfluous
song and dance routine.

The costuming is colorful-ly

adequate. although strictly speak-

ing as ‘a- matter of historical
accuracy,wigs should have been

crack occasionally, but under the
circumstances this hardly seems to
matter.

Over-all, Joshua Sussman is
particularly impressive as the burly
president of the Congress, John
Hancock, and Leonard Cromer
gives a ﬁne performance as the
inebriated
Steven Hopkins.

The physically rather bleak
setting for the’whole drama is the

chamber and anteroom of the

continental Congress in Philadel-

‘phia during the three months

preceding the Declaration. It is a
setting that also, as the program
cryptically and rather unhelpfully
explains, represents “a man, high
street and certain reaches of John
Adams’ mind." In this ambiguous
context, we meet Doren himself as
an aseerbic John Adams, Michael

Can You Distinguish
Real Art from Fake ?

V When is a Van Gogh not a Van

Pitt Art Gallery show entitled
“Forgeries and Their Detection.”
The exhibit will begin today, and
will run through November 1. The
Gallery is located in the Henry Clay

Today, even so-called “non-technical” courses
(psych, soc, bus ad, to name 3) ‘require a vari-
ety of technical calculations'—-complicated cal-
culations thatbecome a whole lot easier when
you have a powerful pocket calculator.

Not surprisingly, there are quite a few such
calculators around, but ours stand apart, and
ahead. We started it all when we introduced the
world’s first scientific pocket calculator back in
1972, and we’ve shown the way ever since.

The calculators you see here are our newest,
the first of our second generation.Both offer you
technology you probably won’t find in compet-
itive calculators for some time to come, if ever.

As Thomas had been married to

stopped cold.

While the defense is busy
shutting down the Buffalo attack,
the offense could be set to pick
apart the Buffalo defense. The Bills
are playing with an inexperienced

"secondary because their -starters

are injured. This, plus thread-the-
needle passing of Terry Bradshaw
exhibited against the Chargers,
should keep the Bills’ defense
running all afternoon. ‘

Let us not forget Harris, either.
He looked very good last Sunday,
even it’ it was only against the
Chargers. He exhibited some good
moves while rushing for over 100
yards.

The only sore spot in the Steeler
offense is the need for a quick
halfback who can break the big
plays. As it stands, Chuck Noll is
willing to stick with Bleier, who
gained 63 yards last week. Bleier is
a good blocker and a strong runner
but is just not fast enough.
Frenchy Fuqua could take over that
positions if he would learn how to
hold on to the football.

Preston Pearson was the closest
thing the Steelers had in the way of
a quick back, but the Steeler
management saw fit to give him his
walking papers.

‘‘I think the best game l’ve
played for Pitt was at Notre Dame
last year,” he said. ‘‘I was just
coming back from being hurt and
played pretty well. That’s the
game that turned things around for
me.”

Wilamowski has to counter-
balance his lack of height with
quickness, intelligence and ag-
gressiveness. The latter some-
times leads to problems.

Last week, against Oklahoma,
for example. ‘

“We were all aggressive,” he
points out. “But their backs were
so quick they would cut inside of us
for the big gains.”

One Oklahoma, though, does not
make a season.

“We’re going to bounce back.
That game got us mad. We’re
aiming for a shutout,” he said.

Coach Bob Roper is impressed
with Wilamowski and is looking
expectantly to the future.

“He’s shown a lot of improve-
ment,” he noted. “He’s good now,
but he’s gonna get much better.
He’s gonna be a good defensive
end.” ' - 6 «

backﬁeld is Tom Smith, a 190
pound tailback who last year ran for
273 yards for a 4.4 average. Smith
will be joined in the backﬁeld by
Scott Goodrich, a hard-nosed,
195-pound fullback. -

The probably starting tight end
will be Kevin Barnes, a‘ senior,
flanked by Randy Knight and Keith
Fimian at the other receiver
positions.

The offensive lines of Coach Jim
Root‘s squad averages about 230
pounds and it’s probably the
biggest question mark for the
Indians. At the guards, returning
lettermen Paul Witkovitz (6-2, 235)
and Jack Droeger (6-2, 220) provide
Root with some experience.

ians

At the tackles, returning letter-
man Evan Lewis [6-3, 225] is joined
by huge Allen Goode, a 6-5,
250-pound sophomore. Doug Gerek
i[6-3, 225] probably will start at
center.

On defense, W&M uses a
five-man front with three deep in
the backfield. Two-year lettermen
Steve Dalton (6-4, 230) and Bruno
Schmalhofer (6-2, 230) return at the
defensive end positions. Ken
Brown (5-11, 225) is back for
another year at one tackle slot, and
joining him in the other tackle
position problably will be Doug
Pearson (6-3, 215). At the nose-
guard position, either Gary Mee-
nan (6-3, 210) or Bob Booth (6-2,
210) will start.

At linebacker, Craig McCurdy
(6-3, 215) gives the Indians plenty
of strength. McCurdy is a
three-year starter who is a
preseason all-conference candi-
date. At the other linebacker
position, a starter from last year,
Jeff Hosmer (6-1, 205), provides
some added experience.

In the backfield, the Indians have
three starters returning: Gary
Oliver and Mickey Carey at the
defensive backs, and Lou Case at
free safety. The strong-side safe’ty
will be Scott Hays, who lettered
last vear.

Home, sweet home is something

    Booters Host Edinboro

BY J LEWIS

With prices what they are these
days, don’t you wish you could get
more than your money’s worth?
Two for the price of one? An added
bonus?

Well, if you plan to attend the
Pitt Panther football game Satur-
day, you’re in luck--you’ll be
getting double your money’s
worth--and more. ‘

How?

Not only will your ticket enable.
you to witness a great football
‘game, but if you come early
enough, about 10:30 am, you’ll be
treated to a great soccer game.

Yes fans, the Pitt soccer team
will host the Edinboro Scots at
10:30 Saturday morning at Pitt
Stadium. The game will lead into
the football game, Pitt against
William and Mary.

And that little football ticket will
allow you to see both.

There are good reasons to be
anxious to see the Pitt soccer team
perform. First, the Panthers’
record (1-1-1) is great, considering
the tough teams against which they
had to start their season--Akron,
Bucknell and Point Park. Second,
the Panthers have improved vastly
from the mediocre 4-6-2 team of a

year _ago. The defense is '
devastating and the offense is
quick.

Third, the Panthers are playing
Edinboro, a team that over the past
few years has been the proverbial
thorn in Pitt's side,._

Each year the teams have met,
they have traded devastating wins.
For example, Pitt crushed the Scots
by eight goals one year, then the
Scots crushed Pitt by eight goals
the next year...and so on, until
each game between these two
teams became a high-scoring
grudge match. ‘

The scary thing is, Edinboro has
the ability to win high-scoring
games. The Scots have more
speedy foreign players on their
explosive offense than San Fran-
cisco has assassins. Plus, they
have returning from a 6-5-1 team
experienced veterans who know
how to score.

Spearheading Edinboro’s quick

offense are a‘ pair of Honduras-born A

soccer players, Amilcar Flores and
Roberto Serrano. Both are so fast,
they make the opposition’s defense
appear like its dragging fa, steel
ball, behind th_em.»V ' I

    

    

be the most dangerous one. He
was the Scots’ leading scorer and

.was named to the All-Western

Pennsylvania Intercollegiate Soccer
Conference All-Star Team.

Also helping out on offense is
Kim MacKay, a native of Australia
who was the leading assist-man for
Edinboro and second in scoring last
year. He was selected to the
Pennsylvania Intercollegiate Soccer
Conference All-Star Teams.

The Scot’s defense is considered
questionable, but last week was
very unquestionable in its 8-0
shutout stomping of Alliance. The
defense was also good last year in a
1-1 tie against Pitt, even though the
Panthers missed several open
goals.

You could say the Scots had all the

luck‘ of the leprechaun with them in
that game.

Edinboro may have the lepre-
chaun, but it’s Pitt that hopes to
win the pot of gold at the end of the
game. Pitt ' Coach Leo Bemis
believes a win can be achieved only

_ by playing one game at a time.

“You can throw out last

Saturday’s game (the 5-3 domina-
tion of Point Park),” Bemis stated
ﬁrmly. “It doesn't mean anything.
We still are trying to ﬁnd out how
good we really are.” »
Whether or not the Panthers still
are trying to ﬁnd themselves, their
1-1-1 record against some of the
best competition is outstanding.
Saturday afternoon’s game should
be a great one.
And you lucky fans are the ones
who profit.
Now you may get to see two
fantastic victories instead of one.

AI Romano Enjoys Being Midd|eGuard

BY TOM HALL

“I'll tell you one thing,” said Al

Romano, Pitt's 6-3 middle guard.‘

“Chasing down a five-and-a-half
foot tailback is going to be a lot
easier than trying to corral
(Oklahoma's) Joe Washington.
Tltat guy was incredible, absolutely
amazing."
The junior economics major,
along with the rest of his
teammates, has little to be
ashamed of after last Saturday’s
game with the Sooners. ‘.‘They are
the fastest team l’ve ever seen.

;"'~T.‘;7;—5l'hey' get my vote for the best team

anytime, and I know becuase l’ve
. been there. ‘ I

"We can't be discouraged, I

think we played a good game
except for the turnovers. I think
we're all looking forward to
William and Mary. We'll really be
out to kill someone, and it might as
well be them.
, “Oklahoma was impressive as
hell. The coaching staff likes to say
we had what you call a ‘breakdown
in technique.’ I thing they're just a
damn good team."

And now we come to the
prospect of the Panthers playing
perhaps the weakest team on this
year’s schedule. Romano ex-

 ‘pressed the feeling among the

team as being “-very good

morale-wise.’ ’

. “Early this week, Coach (John- '

ny) Majors and the rest of the staff
was afraid we might feel letdown
after Oklahoma. They though the
same thing might happen to us this
year that happened to us after the
Southern Cal game last year.”
You might remember. The
Panthers lost to the USC Trojans
16-7, then broke _down the
following week against a relatively
inferior North Carolina squad. “I
can't see it again this year,"
Romano said. “I think a big lift

§,_‘_we‘ll have this time around is that _

we’re gonna be coming home.
“You ean’t imagine what Geor-
gia and Oklahoma are like to play

at. The fans are maniacal, out of ,
Especially playing at A

their trees.
Oklahoma, that’s an experience I
won’t forget. The sound they
generate in that place can literally
rattle your helmet.”

Despite last week's setback,
Romano looks for a good year from
Pitt. — l

“I really like the way this team is
eoiiiiiig together this season. The
<.0ffCX1SlV€‘ line is really getting
their act together, and once they

start getting ‘Hawk’ (Tony Dorsett) _

loose, then somebody is going to be
in trouble.

“The defense is gettiiig‘betting
with every game, maybe with every
practice. The pressure is off now,

we got Number One out of the way,‘ 

and now we can go on with the rest
of the season. This team has made
a lot of progress, and we're going
to get tougher the rest of the way.
Defensive Coach (Jim) Dyer has
done a lot with us, and for us. He
deserves a lot of credit.

“Yeah, the pressure’s off now.
We can take them one at a time.”

As far as his personal game has
gone this year, Romano feels he
isn't quite to the point at which he
should be yet.

The coaches have been down in
me a little bit so far. They know I
can do a better job than l’ve been
doing. A lot has to do with my
technique. I made a switch from
tackle to middle guard, and that
takes a lot of adjusting.

“The tackle- position is a little

easier to play, at least I think so. -

When you’re a middle guard,

— you're right there, and»I.«mean.right
there. A lot of traffic comes right.

down,your throat. It's a helluva
challenge, and I feel like I'm

Is Romano looking forward to

grudge matches? Does his heart

“First of all, we want to win. I

a shutout, and I’d like to see th_e
offense score 100 points, but we'll
just have to go out there and show

everyone-what we can do. -  -

“It sure will be nice to be playin

The Sabres are a product of
Only in
their sixth year, they have proven
that winning hockey clubs begin
with youth. With crafty Punch
Imlach as general manager, Buf-
falo has relied on the draft to
supply the current talent.

The Sabres grabbed center
Gilbert Perreault. and left wing

‘ Richard Martin in the draft, then

stole right wing Rene Robert from
Pittsburgh and the “French Con-
nection line was born.

Last year, the Connection was
awesome. The line totaled 131
goals, with Martin leading the way
with 52. The talented French-Can-
adian has scored 50 or more goals
in each of his two NHL seasons.

His linemates were equally
impressive. Robert tallied an even
100 points to rank seventh in the
league scoring race, while Per-
reault followed in ninth place with
96 points. '

With such a powerful offense,
Buffalo is headed to the top. The’
Sabres’ top line succeeds Boston’s
Esposito-Cashman-Hodge line,
which rewrote the record book and
brought two Stanley Cups to
Beantown, as the league’s premier
trio. Yet Buffalo still may be a
goaltender away from grabbing its
first Cup.

The Sabres have three good
goalies, but a championship team
needs one great one. Roger
Crozier is hampered with stomach
trouble and is on his way out, and
Gerry Desjardins, who will ‘see
some action, is inconsistent. Gary
Bromley probably will get the
starting nod, but he lacks exper-

' ience.

The Boston Bruins are not yet a
pushover. Any team that each year
boasts the league’s top two scorers
still must be considered dangerous.

Bobby Orr and Phil Esposito are
both healthy, though the state of
their knees may determine the
outcome of the Bruins’ season.
Both turned down fantastic con-
tracts from, the World Hockey
Association and thus kept the
Bruins from becoming extinct.

"Boston must realize its top line is
not what it used to be. Ken Hodge

to lead Bostonback to the top, yet
could manage only a 3.13 goals-
against average despite playing
behind one of the league’s top
defensive platoons. Ken Broderick
(2.39) and Ross Brooks (2.98) had
better seasons, but saw consider-
ably less action. The Bruins will
look for Gilbert to improve, but will
keep his‘ backups in mind just in
case they are needed.

Boston had one of the best home
records in the NHL (29-5-6), yet
finished 19 points behind the
Sabres in the division race because
of a dismal 11-21-8 road mark,
eleventh in the league.

If the Bruins are to overtake
Buffalo,‘ Johnny Bucyk (29-52-81)
and Greg Shephard (30-48-78) will
have to come through and disprove
that Boston is a two-man team.
Shephard is young and will be a
major factor in the Bruins’ future.

The Toronto Maple Leafs can
only improve. The Leafs lost the
most man games last year, but still
managed to secure a playoff spot.
When hired, former Pittsburgh
Penguin Coach Red Kelly was
expected to perform miracles, -but
so far has found the going tough.

Darryl Sittler was the one bright
spot, contributing 80 points to an
over-all meager attack. Ron Ellis
(61 points) and Dave Keon (59
points) rounded out the Leaf
ﬁrepower. With the release of
Keon, however, Toronto now must
search for another high-scoring
forward. George Ferguson, Lanny
McDonald and Errol Thompson are

' and a base on which to build a

winner. (But why Meloche hasn't
jumped to the WHA is still a
_mvstery. Gary Simmons, in goal as
a rookie for 10 of California’s 19
wins is another bright spot on a
very lackluster club.

California’s leading scorer‘ was
Larry Patey, who had 45 points in
his initial season. Two other
rookies, Dave Hrechkosy and Al
MacAdam, followed with 43 points
apiece. The Seals are going with
youth, so a contender is still years
away.

The Sabres already may be
looking ahead to April and the

Stanley Cup playoffs and another a

chance to cut down the Philadel-
phia Flyers. If they are successful,
the Stanley Cup will be doing the
“Shufﬂe on to Buffalo.”

NEXT: The Smythe Division
looks to be a three-team race.

Murtaugh
Picks Starter

PITTSBURGH AP--Manager
Danny Murtaugh of the Pittsburgh
Pirates says the pitching rotation

for the first two National League ,

playoff games is mapped out in’ his
mind, but he's not ready to make it
public.

“l’m not ready to make - any
announcements,” Murtaugh said.
‘‘I have in mind how I’m going to
go with my pitchers, but there’s
plenty of time before I say anything
about it.”

Reuss, however, is the likely
starter in the playoffs against the
Cincinnati Reds. And Rooker will
probably be the second game
pitcher.

Norton Wants Ali Win
In Heavyweiﬂit Bout

MANILA AP--Ken Norton is a
very good heavyweight whose
career has been marked by
uncertainty that even colors his

.—“‘3oting interest in the Muhammed

.-fli-Joe Frazier heavyweight cham-
pionship bout here Wednesday.

Norton is a former Frazier-spar-
ring partner who has given Ali two
of his toughest ﬁghts--winning and
losing 12-round split decisions with
the champion in 1973.

“From the sentimental end, I'd
like to see Joe win,” Norton said
Thursday. “From the business
end, I’d rather see Ali win.”

Frazier very possibly could retire
if he wins, which would throw
Norton into an elimination tourna-
ment. Also, Frazier has said he
would prefer not to ﬁght Norton

vglgecause of their friendship.

/
/

»-"Ali said this week that he would
like to have one more fight if he
beats Frazier and that he would like
it to be the winner of a bout
between Norton and George
Foreman, the man from whom Ali
regained the title.

Norton said he is willing to ﬁght
Foreman and conﬁdent he can beat
the man who handed him his most
humiliating defeat. Norton earned

a title shot at Foreman after his two’

good showings against Ali but was

knocked out in two rounds in

Caracas, Venezuela, in 1974.

But despite Norton’s willing-
ness--his manager, Bob Biron, said
Foreman has turned down three
offers to fight Ken--Ali favors
Foreman. _

“If they don’t fight each other, I
will fight Foreman,” said the
champion. "‘He’s the exchamp.
He gave me the shot. I’ve already
fought Norton twice.”

So Norton, who always has been
in the position of having to prove
himself despite a 35-3 pro record,
could ﬁnd himself in the position of
not being able to prove himself.

“After the ﬁght in Caracas we
had a meeting on whether I sould
continue ﬁghting or quit,” said
Norton. ‘TI said I was going to work
my way back. I think I’ve done it.”

“What bothers me is I lost and
fought my way back up to
contention. Foreman lost in Africa
and hasn’t fought since.”

Both Ali and Frazier worked out
again Thursday, Ali in a lecturing
mood again and Frazier relenting
and talking * to reporters after
saying a day earlier that he was
ﬁnished talking.

“I’m not making a prediction,”
said Ali, “but it's very possible the
ﬁrst combination in the ﬁrst minute
or two of the ﬁrst round and the
ﬁght could end.”

NFL Owners Offer
Headed for Rejecﬁon

BY BRUCE LOWITT
APSports Writer
The Washington Redskins, Kan-
sas City Chiefs, Philadelphia
Eagles, Green Bay Packers and
Detroit Lions joined Houston and

' Buffalo Thursday in voting against

the National Football League
owners’ latest contract. The offer
appeared headed for overwhelming
rejection by the players’ union.

Late Wednesday, the Houston
Oilers, by a unanimous - 43-0 vote,
and the Buffalo Bills, by 42-1
count, turned down the contract
which the NFL Management
Council, the owners’ bargaining
agent, had called “our best shot”
when it was presented to the NFL
Players Association last Monday in
Chicago. -

The union passed the four-year
contract proposal to the players
without a recommendation and
sources close to the NFLPA say the
union leadership's response to the
offer was almost wholly negative.

Neither Washington nor Phila-
delphia revealed its vote count
Thursday but both saidthe results
were “overwhelmingly against”
the offer. Philadelphia’s vote was
24 against it and 18 for it while the
Lions vote was 27-15 in opposition.

The Packers rejected the contract
by a two-thirds vote, the team's
player rep said. The exact count
was not given.

Not counting the unreleased
Washington and Kansas City
ballots, the total player vote was
136-34 against the offer. All six of
the voting clubs have said they plan
to play their upcoming Sunday
games.

A number of other teams have
said they probably will wait until
Friday before voting. And some
player representatives already
have expressed the opinion that

So Allyn and Finley are perfectly
content‘--they say. Everything is
peachy. Then why are the baseball
bigwigs spending all this time
huddling over their franchise
problems?

Well, Allyn and Finley notwith-

standing, there are a few other

items of concern. The main one is
.Seattle, where a $20 million triple.

damages suit against’ baseball ‘is
pending and due to go to trial "in
January. The action involves the'
city’s loss of its franchise to
Milwaukee in 1970.

Baseball has a distinct aversion
to courtrooms and there is’ a
convenient way to avoid a messy
legal showdown in Seattle.
