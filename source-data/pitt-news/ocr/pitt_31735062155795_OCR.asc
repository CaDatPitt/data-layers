In a press conference convened in the Webster Hall" Hotel
yesterday afternoon, Chancellor Rufus -H. Fitzgerald, Vice-

chancellor Robert A. Moore, Dr.@W. S. McEl1roy, deanof the I

School of Medicine, and Dr. Lowell J. Reed, president of
The Johns Hopkins University answered the questions of
newsmen concerning. the recent $15,000,000 grant to the medi-
cal school. 6

Chancellor Fitzgerald, obviously
elated over the endowment grant,
expressed the opinion that the

. University as a whole would bene-
‘ . fit from the impetus applied to the

medical division. “It is inevita-
ble," he-‘said, “that the rest of the

1 _ University must develop albng

with the medical division)? Dr.
1VlcEllroy heartily concurred in this
belief and -added that the grant”
will be helpful in arousing" public
support for the College and other
schools of the University.”

He added that “It would bring
hometo theicommunity the need
for adequate support for the Uni-
Versit§’.”    ~ -.

President Sends Message

Governor John S. Fine and
Mayor David, L. Lawrence were
present to witness the a’<nnbunc,e-
fnent at‘”the banquet and both ex-
pressed their approval andpride
which the Commonwealth and City
-of Pittsburgh would derive from
the progressive step in the expan-
sion of the University.

President of the United States
Dwight D. Eisenhower expressed
his delight over the announcement
in a letter to Chancellor Fitzgerald.

President “Delighted”

“I am delighted to learn of the
great opportunity for ‘further serv-
ice sbeingimade available to the
Universityof Pittsburgh School of
Medicine as a result of large pri-
vate grants,” the President’s letter
stated. “It is the type of advance
that is Wholly in keeping with the
traditions of our country. My good
wishes go to all’ participating in
your ceremony," the letter con-
cluded.

Commenting on. the value of the
grant, Dr. Moore felt that the
present funds would enable the
University to increase the staff in
the School of Medicine and sup-
plernentthe present part-time fac-
ulty ‘with’ a full-time faculty staff.
“Undoubtedly we can get the best

possible men in any‘ given ﬁeld

faculty members. Three Pittsburgh organizations are re-
sponsible for the endowment fund: the A. W. Mellon Edu-
cational and Charitable Trust, the Sarah Mellon Scaife Foun-
dation and the Richard King Mellon Foundation.
Announcementof the grant was made in an official statement
by Chancellor Rufus H. Fitzgerald at a formal dinner last night in
the Commons Room. An audience of 350, including prominent medi-
cal, educational,.and governmental ﬁgures, greetedthe announcement
wtih a spontaneous burst of applause. A
He said that it will be. used to support broad innovations in
medical teaching proposed by Dr. Robert A. Moore, recently ap-
pointed vice-chancellor in charge of the schools of the health pro-
fessions. A

principal speaker at the dinner, hailed the gift as a demonstration
of private enterprise contribuitng to the future welfare of the country.-‘
“It has been recognized by many educational and research
surveys,” he ‘said, “that this country will suffer irreparable loss
if the private universities are not provided with the facilities
that will enable them to grow in scope and in excellence. Un-
less we want these institutions to be tax-dominated, private en-
terprise and capital ‘must find their way. of supporting. higher
education.” .

Although the grant is the largest received by the University in
its 167-year history, and takes rank among the greatest gifts ever
made to one institution, Chancellor Fitzgerald explained that an.
additional $15,000,000 of endowment‘ funds must be obtained dur-
ing the‘ next ﬁve years in order to complete the program projected
by Dr. Moore.. ‘ J A

He also explained that the present gift 0 is not related to the

andipharmacy. During the past year ,more than $7,000,000 has been
subscribed to this ‘objective by Pittsburgh industries and an addi-
tional $2,000,000 is available from a previous campaign. ' '- - E ~

Dr. Lauffer is head of the Department of biophysics at

Kenneth Smith is a biologist at
Cambridge University in England.
Their book, “Advances in Virus
Research” is an attempt, “. . . to
bring together in one place, all
that is known about the nature of
a speciﬁc virus.” A volume of this
type is almost indispensable to
men in various fields of scientiﬁc
research since it would be a very
time consuming task to go through
the myriad volumes which touch
on phases of virus research.

Valuable In Other Fields

Since this first volume and
those which will follow deal with
all types of viruses, the books will
prove valuable aids to physicians,
physicists, biologists, chemists and
men connected with various other
fields of science.

Dr. Lauﬁer first considered ed-
iting such a book ‘hen Kenneth

Grant to Improve

The Allegheny County Unit of

awarded four local institutions a
total of $9,052 to improve their
facilities to serve the cancer pa-

‘The largest amount, of $5,120,
goes to the Department of Pathol-

continuation of the department’s

This laboratory was established

However at last Thursday night’s
meeting, legislators heard Dean
Biddle, and SC advisor Vigdor
Kavalier speak for the idea, as a
means of bringing student partici-
pation to Pitt.

Dean Biddle presented the
views of the Committee on Un-
dergraduate Deans which has
been favorable to the idea for
the past two years. Biddle said
that a ﬁfth hour would be a
“real opportunity for the devel-

opment of student life that
makes life tolerable here.”

Until World War II there had
always been a free hour of some
sort at Pitt. However, SC mem-
bers were told, the great inﬂux of
veterans created the need for util-
ization of all possible hours for
classes.

Some Congress membersdfelt, at

relax or work, free from pres-
sures. A
The original motion made by
Lou McCullough read that “SC do
everything in its power to have a
free ﬁfth hour for undergraduate
schools.” Paul Petro amended the
motion to include the appointment
of a committee to investigate

means by which the proposal -could
be brought about. .

In surprise business Student
C 0 n g r e s s unanimously voted
against a request from NSA to
have its annual National Execu-
tive meeting in Pittsburgh at Pitt.
Ross Reese, SC president, present-
ed the unusual request. Pitt was

asked to serve as hosts to a group i

to which it does not belong.
Little less than a year ago SC

the proposal because of the great

expense in dues that would be

incurred. They felt that it “was
not worth it.” _

Reese said that it is no secret
that NSA would ‘cherish Pitt’s

Miss Kneil stated, “but we will
show the students how to obtain

tion.” ' ‘_

She says the Reference Room
contains various types of “source
books, indexes, encyclopedias, bib-
liographies, government docu-
ments, United . Nations publica-
tions, old bound periodicals,‘ and
pamphlets.”

A graduate of Bryn Mawr in
1946, Miss Kneil was awarded the
A. B. degree in history and poli-
tical science. She then attended
the Carnegie Library School 'for
one year and received a B.S. in
Library Science degree from there
in 1947. Thereafter she became
a librarian at Pitt, in the Refer-
ence Room. “I was impressed by
the size of Pitt after having at-
tended a much smaller school,”
she said.

Travels for Study

In September 1950, Miss Kneil,
who lives in Cfafton, sailed from
American shores to England. At
the University of Leeds‘ in Eng-
land, she began to work in the
Reference Room. “I suppose you
might say I was an exchange li-
brarian,” she stated.

In the summers, she visited the

V libraries at Oxford and Cambridge,

the four Scottish universities, and
traveled to the Isle of Mann, “home
of some of my ancestors and of the
Manx cat.” Miss Kneil also visited
libraries and other points of in-
terest on much of the continent.
She remembers that “The people
of Leeds and other places I vis-
ited, were extremely hospitable
and helpful in my work, and also
eager to show me places of inter-
es .”

Miss Kneil says the biggest ques-
tion of the Europeans whom she
met concerned the tremendous size
of the United States. “They
wanted to know all about it.”

In September 1952, Miss Kneil
returned to American shores and
to the Reference Room on the ﬁfth
ﬂoor of the Cathedral. In addition

Playhouse Features

Pittsburgh Playhouse oﬁered
theater-goers another “ﬁrst” last
Saturday evening when the recent
Broadway hit “The Time of the
Cuckoo” opened a four week run.

“The Time of the Cuckoo” is
the Broadway hit of last season
and it is playing the Hamlet St.
side of the Playhouse.

Written by Arthur Laurents, the

. strange title of this gentle comedy

can best be explained by the'au-
thor’s foreward to the script—a
deﬁnition taken from the Encyclo-
pedia Brittanica: \

“The Cuckoo is a summer visit-
ant to the whole of Europe. It
proclaims its arrival by a cry
heralding the season of love.”

The comedy deals with an
American spinster who travels to
Venice, like the cuckoo, to ﬁnd
love. - _

Making her Playhouse debut in
the leading role is Grace Holtby
who will play the romantically-

documents section in the Refer-
ence Room, she is the head of pe-
riodical records and teaches a_ one
credit course for students in Li-
brary Methods. ‘
Teaches Library Courses

“The course acquaintsstudents
with the library, how to use the
card catalog, technical manuals,
and how to use the library mate-
rials for any of their courses.”

Miss Kneil said she decided she
wanted to be a librarian while at
Bryn Mawr. “I suppose,” she stat-
ed “an "aunt of mine who was a
librarian inﬂuenced me a bit.”

As for the future, Miss Kneil
said,~“There has been quite a bit
of progress at Pitt since I ‘came,
and a great deal more to come. ...We
hope to have our own building in
the future, and more services for
students and faculty members.”

"Point of Na Re turn 

The Air Force has a phrase which appliesto college as
well as to the armed’forces—“the point of no return.” When
this point has been reached in an airplane, half the fuel is
gone and the pilot has only one choice. He must ﬂy on to
his destination. Here at Pitt we reach a point midway
through each semester when our most logical step is to go
on, even though some of us may feel that we have literally
I run ‘out of gas. The destination is now in sight for the ﬁrst
-semesters work. ‘Many have done well. Others havevfallen
short of their goals. But all may benefit from the experi-
ence of the ﬁrst semester and use this experience as insur-
ance for a safe passage through next semester’s “point of

no return.”

Enough forA|l 

By Tim Kevar

No, one could pick up today’s issue of the
NEWS and miss the story that is spread over the
front page. Vague rumors have run amok through
the University halls during the past few weeks
concerning the story which can now be printed
and which is currently being featured in news-
papers and wire services throughout the country.
The tremendous importance
of the gift to the medical division
of the University has not been

burgh. It is a step towards build-
lng and maintaining one of the
finest if not the ﬁnest medical
center in the world. And there-
by hangs the subject material «
for thisycolumn. ‘This news will , — ,
undoubtedly be of vast pleasure and pride to
much of the University——students and faculty alike.
The administration members who have labored for
the goal of a top medical school are conﬁdent that
their dreams will be realized. But there are many
who will treat the news with little concern and
there are many others who will be disgruntled be-
cause the health division apears to be the center
of the University and the "undergraduate schools
are: just along for the ride. ‘

It does seem to be that way. But a careful
examination of the progress of the University in
the last few years will point out to the disgruntled
people that there: is a very deﬁnite organization
and a ‘greater scope of expansion in, the making
for the Universityas a whole.

Several’ years ago, it was decided that the medi-

 

cal ﬁeld required a thorough overhaul if it was

to keep its head above water. The wheels of
ﬁnance meshed more smoothly with the gears oi!
the University and the resulting machine generat-
ed the power for expansion. The machine became
more complex as each physical feature and ﬁnancial
promise was brought into play. To those whose
main interests were not in the medical line, it ap-
peared to be a Frankenstein monster. But these
people did not realize that a machine ‘serves more
thanonepurpose. An automobileengine also fur-
nishes power for the lights, radio, windshield wip-
ers, heater andghorn. As the medical center ex-
panded other parts of the University became, in-
volved in the machine. A ﬁeldhouse was erected
for athletics, property was realized for an educa-
tional TV set—up, engineering buildings “received

funds for additions, an educational revision was _,
made in the undergraduate curriculum for the

College, and property was obtained for science and
library buildings. I

All told, the University had access to more than
30 million dollars in buildings already erected or
in the definite planning stage. More plans are
beinglaid for such things as a student union, dor-
mitories, ‘and similar facilities for all University
students.‘ And still the medical plan moves on.

« We cannot condemn the University for overlooking

any particular aspect or phase of its educational
responsibility. This is not the case. The entire
expansion program is following a well-designed

format that is occasionally altered or abetted by

unexpected circumstances that seem to place em-
phasis on one particular phase. Monday’s news

was expected and, to some degree, part of the all-

inclusiye plan. It does not mean that all else has

been neglected.

Those ConfusingsPermi’r Cards

By Jim’ Bender
The last few weeks have been
rather confusing ones for ‘me, be-
. cause of the new system of fares

' instituted by the‘Pittsbu,rgh Rail-

ways.

" The streetcar ride was bad‘

enough when I had to fumble for
pennies, b u t '
‘ the new trol-
ley _ p e r m i t
cards make me
hesitate to use
a streetcar at
all. Everyone’
says the cards
are simple to
use, but I have
visions of rid-.
ing past the
yellow or blue
zone or *what- .
ever it is and then having toipay
another .dime. (It isn’t the dime,
you understand, it’s just the etc.)

I understand the permit cards
well enough up to the point
where I show the motorman the
card and pay my money, but then
I’m at a loss as to what I can do
with the card. ,. The company

 

\

made a point of telling the pub-
lic that the permit cards were
transferable, but they failed to
say just how transferable. I
know, ~ for instance, that I can
give my card to someone else to
use, but can I give it to the per-
son in back of me after I pay

my fare? Please explain, gen-W
,tlemen of the streetcar company,

just how transferable this card
is going to be. '

My confusion doesn’t end there,
either. I’m also wondering if the
streetcar company would accept
overnight guests. The idea would
work something like this. A’ A per-
son would get on the streetcar at
midnight and pay the fare for
eight hours of riding, which at
the current rates and with his
transferable p e r m i t, w o u 1 (1
amount to $1.55. At eight in the
morning he would get off the
streetcar and go to work.

An_ arrangement of this sort
would be ideal for the Pitt stu-
dent. The student could ride un-
til eight, and then get off at Pitt
in time for his first class. He
could even keep his clothes in
the back of the streetcar, if he

Sex and Literature

SEX! I feel almost certain that _

I could now write on almost any
topic imaginable and you would
read what I wrote. _You might
not agree. You might not like it.
In fact you might not even un-

would be per-
fectly normal

This curios-
ity is common

thus has been
capitalized up-
on by one Mickey Spillane who
writes about a guy named Mike
Hammer. A close inspection re-
veals the unlikeliness of “That
Hammer Guy” but readers of
Spillane’s novels do not read to
analyze. Spillane. realized this

factor in Spillane’s popularity
since it creates an initial interest

in his books. Perhaps we should

advertise such authors as Shake-
speare and, in the case of Ham-
let, place upon the cover of the
book, a drawing of a shapely
Ophelia, scantily clad, in order to
boost circulation.
Publicity Boosts Circulation
For, some of the Immortal
Bard’s work would not go un-

censored by‘ today’s standards, if _

the entire content was known.
Certain contemporary writers,
classed with the best, say the
same things Spillane does but
fail to achieve his popularity.
Ernest Hemmingway, Philip
Wylie, Aldous Huxley, William
Faulkner, John Steinbeck and

’ Ernest Gann are just a few of the
men who are classed among the ,

top thinkers and writers of our
time and who handle the prob-
lem of sex as openly as Spillane,
but are as much a contrast to him
as television is to the tom-tom.

gentlemen of the streetcar com-
pany, why you have not made
this service available before.
When Ithink of the basic rea-
son why the streetcar company

fused, for they have overlooked

sexuality and perversion. These I

men recognize suchsituations for
what they are, an unescapable
part of ogir present day society,
and they ,deal with them openly
and frankly without offending the

As for descriptive phrases
which paint a verbal picture, read
Gann’s “Blaze of Noon.” No.
where in contemporary literature
has the mutual love of a man and

This Writing Inadequate

But the written word of such

adequate to describe the contents

Cagers Hitting Comeback Trail  

By DAVE MAZER
Those skeptics who said every Pitt basketball win this
year will be an upset may yet have to swallow their words.

with the lone exception a triumph over Bradley in the Steel
Bowl, the Panthers have come to life with some wel1-or-

son ﬁve wrecked the Mountain-
eers’ 57-game home winning
streak.

Now, with Westminster coming
up this Saturday and the Pitt
record at a more respectable 3-8,
the Panther may prove to have
claws after all. 1

Westminster so far has a

10-4

slate but the Titans were Pitt vic-
tims twice last year. In one of
the oldest series in Panther his-
tory, dating back to 1905-06, the
slight edge of 19-17 goes to the
Skyscraper U. boys.
Four Road Games
The tilt with the New Wilming-

'tonians will be the_Panthers’ only

one during the mid-year ﬁnal per-
iod. Beginning next Thursday,

1 however, the Panthers play four

games in seven days, all on the
road. Their visits will be to Penn

‘State, a return match with Co-

lumbia, Georgetown, and Navy, in
that order.

Meanwhile, sophomore Frank
Zimmovan has won a place on the
starting ﬁve. ~A rugged 6-2 re-
bounder from Uniontown, he drop-
ped in 12 tallies against the
Mounties for his highest produc-
tion of the season.

Also notable in the Panthers re-
cent upsurge is the ﬁne play of
senior Bernie Artman who is now
at forward.

' Burch Still Leader

He teams with Ed Pavlick on the
forward line while captain Dutch
Burch and Joe Fenwick remain
at the guards. Burch, incidentally,
is still the leading scorer with 146

. markers in 11 games. for a 13.3 . '

average». Pavlick is right behind
with 125 points and an 11.4 rate.

look back and record some of the impressions from last
football season. Most of them have nothing to do with
sports; they are just idle reminiscences from two of the

four trips touched up with a little light treatment.

The

trash can is justaround the corner.

N otre Dame—The number of¢

Pennsylvanians who made the trip
was both surprising and gratify-
ing, and the number who were
feeling their oats was staggering.
They had plenty to cheer about
for one half at least. Many of
them who arrived on the travel
service ’trains from Pittsburgh
wore Notre Dame ribbons, though.

Tense Moment
South Bend is a madhouse of
milling people and traﬂic jams on

home dates. Learned that no one
in town would give Pitt more than
six points in informal wagering.
Up until the Irish pulled ahead,
the press box was _ a picture of
sweating palms and nervous
glances . . . Captain Tom unable
to sit still during Pitt’s opening
drive for touchdown . . . Honey-
moon over in second half.

. Churned up dust. around the
outside of the stadium choking
before and after games. Pitt team
and traveling party was terriby
depressed after the loss-they
wanted to win so badly . . . Din-
ner in Elkhart tasted lousy--the
foodihad a lot to do with it . . .
Return trip became almost pleas-
ant after depression wore off and
News reporter Beano Cook ﬁnally
fell asleep. ‘
Northwestern—In spite of the
loss at Dyche Stadium, which was
tough to take because of the offi-
ciating and erratic play, the week-
end in Chicago was well-spent.
Just" like rubes we spent Saturd-
uay night sightseeing in the Loop;
reporter Dave Mazer and I ran
into Pitt publicity man Bob Wy-
coff, Carl Hughes (Press), and

formed a party, with Hughes as?‘
the all-knowing guide (looks are
deceiving). «

said it wasn’t even music. Here’s

Kiseda discovered a joke which
he still refuses to part with. Any
time someone mentions Chicago’s
Elevated, he can be counted on- to
exclaim, “The ‘El you say!” It was
funny the first ﬁfty times. Had
a large steak in what is supposed
to be one of the better steak
houses . . . I could only conclude
that someone had given the res-
taurateur a bum steer.

Chicagoans are such shy, re-
tiring people . . .' When we paid the
check in one place, the guy said,
with a wink, “Aren’t you going
to take care of the waiter?”. . .
He was the waiter. With a grand-
iose gesture of rnagnanimous mu-
niﬁcence, I placed a quarter in
his clutching hand.

“During the spring of ’52-my last year
at the University of Maryland—-I was in-
terviewed by a number of companies. I
was about to get my B.S. degree in

accounting. ~ “

“It seemed to me that there.was a great _

deal to be learned from the way I was
interviewed. Bell System interviewers
took their time about job offers. They
didn’t rush me or themselves.

“I had two talks with the Bell inter-
viewers and then was "invited to meet and
talk with department heads. iNot only
did they get a chance to look me over,
bu.t.I also had an opportunity to get a
closer look at their operation. I ﬁgured
if the Bell System was that careful in se-
lecting its men, it is careful in‘ other
things. The interview was the tip-off.

“That’s why I’m working here in Wash-
ington, D. C., for one of the Bell Com-

general training—was supervising a bill-

“Since then I have assisted on internal
audits in all departments. I’ve helped with
special studies for management and have
become better acquainted with operations
of the entire company. Now I’m working
on the general books as an accounting
supervisor. O A

“That Bell System interview has cer-
tainly meant a lot to me.”

Ed Burtner is moving forward. His experi-
ence is typical of the engineering, physical
science, arts and social science, and business
administration graduates who join the Bell
System. He went with an operating telephone
company. There also are opportunities with
the Bell Telephone Laboratories, Western
Electric and Sandia Corporation.

Research Move

In Progress

Addison H. Gibson" laboratory at
Pitt has promoted a research pro-
gram that ranged from hunting
the relationship between emotion-
al shock and skin allergy in
guinea pigs to locating brain

tumors with atomic particles.

The laboratory was made possi-
ble when the trustees made a
$200,000 grant in Dec. 1947 to set
up the lab in the School of Med-
icine for Pitt Medical Center hos-.
pitals in Oakland. '

The lab has also developed a
uniq:.‘i»:> method of treating various
lung cancer cases with radioac-
tive gold. The technique was sug-

gested by Dr. Edward M. Kent,‘

chest surgery chief at Pitt. - .

Dr. Campbell H. Moses. lab-
oratory director, said 1,121 patients
in the tri-state area hospitals have
received atomic aid in treating ill-
ness with radioisotopes with lab-
oratory facilities. He listed $135,-
552 in research grants which the
laboratory has attracted in ﬁve
years of operation.
