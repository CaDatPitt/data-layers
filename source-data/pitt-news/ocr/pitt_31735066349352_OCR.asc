SG Election to be Reheld

BY BILL MOORE

New elections for Student
,ﬂ,_,_,,,Government Board president will
1. gjbe held next Tuesday because of

irregularities in the two Student
Union voting booths, the ‘Student
Government Elections Committee
(SGEC) ruled last night. _
Barry Weisband, defeated by
Joe Gronsky in the presidential
race by 32 votes, contested the
election because slips of paper had
A shifted in the two machines and
covered his name on the ballot.
The slips were used tovcorrect
the misspelling of presidential
‘ candidate Larry Chaban’s name in
the original listings.

Candidates in the second elec-
tion, limited to Gronsky, Weis-
band, Chaban and Mark Satinoff—-
the original candidates,-will be
permitted to campaign, but no
further campaign expenditures will
be allowed. _

Chaban and Satinoff, both
pulling far fewer votes than the two
top vote-getters, indicated earlier
they would participate in a second
election. .

Weisband had asked the SGEC
to invalidate the election, claiming
voters were denied the right to cast
a vote for him because his name
had been effectively absent from
the machines for an undetermined
time.

research proposals is under consi-
deration by the Chancellor’s Office.

The Office of Research also
would handle the management and
supervision of research centers at
Pitt.

Individual departments and fa-
culty members currently handle
their own’ research needs. Pitt
ranks 29th in the country in the
amount of federal funding for
research programs, having receiv-
ed $38 million in grants last year.

But. accordingto David Powers,
assistant to the chancellor for
Academic Affairs, federal alloca-
tiun methods are changing, and
Pitt needs an Office of Research to
maintain and enlarge current
research programs.

“Several federal agencies, in-
cluding the Department of Trans-
portation and Housing and Urban

' Development have indicated they

will sponsor only six research

, centers across the country,”
 Powers said.

“With this emphasis on fewer

i but larger research programs, Pitt
 needs ‘ a coordinated office to

facilitate information and improve
communication among researchers
and between Pitt and‘the federal

V candidates involved,”

“I believe wholeheartedly the
Elections Committeedid the best
thing for the students and for the
Weisband’
said -after the SGEC ruling. “I am
quite pleased, to say the least.”

Contacted late last night follow-
ing the decision, Gronsky criticized
the handling of the elections bythe
Elections Committee.

“Theelection was handled quite
poorly, from the misspelling of the
name to the way they corrected it.

It's a shame I’m being penalized-

for the mistakes of the Elections
Committee.” , _‘ "

Earlier yesterday, at an open
hearing before the SGEC, Weis-
band produced numerous witnes-
ses testifying they had seen slips of
paper covering all or part of his
name on the S.U. machines.

No evidence was presented at
the hearing to suggest the paper
was moved purposely.

The-policies of Alpha Phi Omega I

(APO) service fraternity in return-
ing money and unsold books from
its annual book exchange to the
owners has evoked criticism from
several students recently.

One student charged that being a
night student made it impossible
for him to pick up his books, which
he ‘valued atmore than $60.

Another student complained she__

was hospitalized during the desig-
nated time for picking up‘ the
money. APO would not return
money as the -designated period
had expired.

Being unaware of the short
period for receiving the money, one
student missed the deadline. “I
couldn't pick up the money and I
need that $14,” he said. “They

. (APO) told me the money was

going to charity, and what was I
worried about.”

Students were given two days,
Jan. 20 and 21, to pick up the
unsold books or money, according
to APO First Vice President Larry
Walsh. He said this information
was printed-on the receipt the
student received for each book and
also on the posters.

Legal Awareness Committee
member Dave Cross said if the
deadline information was on the
receipt, it was a binding contract.
“There’s nothing legally the
student can do except to plead with

"other projects,"

the APO for reconsideration.” V
“This is the first term that we
decided to have this‘ deadline,”
“Last October, we
also decided not to take individual
cases because if you make

exceptions for one person, you

have to make them for everyone.
You have to draw the line
somewhere."

Walsh also said keeping the
money in the APO ofﬁce poses
security problems.

“We had to streamline the book
exchange so we would have -more
time to become involved in our
Walsh said.
“Another reason for the deadline
was because we have bills to pay in

,connection with the book ex-

change.”

The unreturned money is given
to charity and the unsold books go
to a prison through Director of
Veteran Affairs Jack Hayes,
according to APO President John
DePaul. .

“I really think these people have
a reasonable gripe," DePaul said.
“As it stands now, APO can’t do
anything until next Monday’s
meeting."

‘‘It was really important that

- students picked up the books and

money on the deadlines," DePaul
said. He said APO had trouble last
term with people coming in weeks
after the exchange for money.

Walsh said thepeople putting
books on sale should pay more
attention to the hours for returning
the money.

SNEAKS SHOULD BE
BRIEFED, HELMS SAYS

WASHINGTON (AP)——Former
CIA Director Richard M. Helms
said yesterday that any new
congressional committee set up to
monitor intelligence agencies

-should be briefed on covert

operations before they are under-
taken. -'

Helms, currently under invesf‘\~

gation by the Justice Department»
for his role in past Central
Intelligence Agency .misdeeds, also

‘told the Senate Government

Operations Committee he never
felt himself to be above the law.
But he said that “some of the

‘cases where I got in difficulty”-

involved conflicting laws. He cited
a provision in the 1947 National
Security Act charging the director
to protect intelligence sources and
methods.

One of the accusations being
investigated by the Justice Depart-
ment involves Helms’ alleged
approval of a 1971 break-in at the
offices of a former CIA employe

suspected of a security violationjé-\,_
“If there’s. going to be -a’_,_,«'‘

oversight committee, I think it
ought to be in on the take off,”
Helms told the committee.

collect $331,000, enough to cover
that deficit, he added.

The 1976-77 housing budget
matches $4,181,426 in income
against $4,181,008 in expenses, for
a $418 surplus. '

Announcements of the increase
will be circulated among residents

students to bid for residences when
they don't know how much it will
cost them."

There will be no reduction in
services, Hughes assured students.
“We had thought about merely
reducing services (security, main-
tenance) instead of increasing the
rates, but those services are pretty
much essentials.” _

The. increase .for spring and

‘summer session residents hasn't

been determined yet. Hughes
estimated it will approach 10%.
The ﬁgures should be set by early
March, he explained. '

‘ Last year, single rooms cost $237

No Matter Who Won

The most disappointing aspect of last week's Student Government
election was not that personal favorites may have lost or that others

' - ha ‘e won. but that the voter tuniout was terribly low.
m‘/lxxltholighi last year's turnout was heralded as a disaster ‘(U111)’ 1,800.
voting of some l3.()()0 eligible.) no one expected this year s turnout to
be even worse. But oiilv 1.055 showed up at the polls last week.

That the top two presidential candidates carried 38.7% and 36.8% of

members-elect did even worse.

A the total vote is deceiving. Actually. the frontrunner received only
-'l.9°‘d of the undergraduate student body’s vote.

Most Board

Needless to say. this is scarcely a comfortable mandate with which -
one can go into oﬁice and argue the need for various new projects.

Things will really -get tough for Board members when they  before
the administration with a proposal and try to prove that the majority of
students agree with their representatives. g

The reason for the low turnout is as elusive as the remedy for it. One
thing we know is that. it can't be because of inactivity on the part of the

‘past year's Board members.

Though some of the chief issues ‘
’ eventually went against the students, Iarry Platt’s Board was

generally responsive and energetic, unlike Mike Furick’s Board before

11.

Whatever the cause. it obviously can’t be remedied overnight. The
only course of action to suggest is one of intensive involvement on the

part of the incoming Board.

_ While an alert Boardprobably won’t"spur student interest to new
‘ heights, it might be able to retain what little voting-day activity there
was. After all, 4.9% may be low——but it isn’t rock bottom,

Letter

 

I would like to bring to the.

attention of students the inade-
quacy of the Jan. 26 editorial
appearing in The Pitt News

I concerning the football ticket issue.

If the students were given an
accurate description of the facts
concerning all areas of inquiry,
then they would be more positively
aware of how the tentative system

could benefit them. This brings to

mind two main areas:
1) Every
guaranteed a

student will be
seat. If 25,000

students wanted admission to any ‘

~ game, then these ' same 25,000

would be guaranteed admission.

.2) There exists the complete
possibility of thechanneling of any
charge directly back to the
individual student.

Might I again bring to the
attention of concerned students
that their supposed leadership is
not necessarily dependent upon the
Student Government Board, nor
their direction that which The Pitt
News dictates. The Greeks. RSA,
BAS, and Engineers have dealt

with issues, at times, far more

effectively than the 5GB. This
brings us to your statement in

‘paragraph two that the committee

operated without student input. If
youarenso naive as to declare that
these ‘groups do not ‘represent
substantial student input, then I
might consider classifying your

. coverage to be engaged in the

recent subversive politicking which
has resulted on the renewed attack
on the football ticket issue. Why

I am writing in regard to the Jan.

I strongly feel that the article
downgrades Pitt athletes, Pitt
students, and the University itself.

First of all, in order for an athlete
to be accepted by this University, a
person must have acceptable
grades which allow him or her to be
eligible for scholarships and
grants. These grades must first
meet the University’s academic
standard requirements before ath-
letics can be considered. In
essence. Pitt athletes must be

University body; all students, male
and female. from the antisocial
bookworms down to the newest
incoming freshman. Each time an
athletic event is televised, the
profits are dispersed among all
fields ofthe University. not just the
Athletic Depatment.

A certain percentage of the profit
is designated to the University fir
academics. Here the profit is
spread out for the use of the
student as well as for the atlilctc.

“Whoever has eaten ' the most

awarded $100. Second-place win-

Well. I’d eat anything for Curt

While it's unnecessary to speak
for the Student Food Committee
since they have enough going
against them, the RSA, great
student‘ champion in the dorm

will undoubtedly sit down with
housing administrators at its next
meeting with mozzarella on its

While gluttony in the United

pseudo-responsible groups like the

pointing it out that makes it seem
as though they're promoting it.

implies. Pitt is trying to achieve its
own level of athletic superiority,
putting itself above these other
schools. not competing. with them.

Hopefully, neither Pitt nor any
other important school will ever be
just a farm system for. professional
sports. Every year professional
sports choose only a few players in
the professional draft. It.is a rarity
if two or more players from any
school get picked and have the
opportunity to sign professional
sports contracts. If a school

football ,team yearly, how .. can
collegiate sports be regarded as

out of 25 seniors ever get a chance

A “A Little Help. From Your

PAAR Aids Rape Victims

BY LORI VALIGRA

Rape is a difﬁcult problem with
which to deal, but one Pittsburgh
group is trying. The Pittsburgh
Action Against Rape (PAAR), with
35 active hotline workers and 150
members, is a volunteer organi-
zation with a feminist philosophy
which provides information and
short-term emotional support for
rape victims.

Originally associated with the‘

Rape Crisis Center in McKeesport.
PAAR became an independent
organization last March. Group
‘members include nurses, doctors,
psychologists, counselors and
housewives.

“Rape is a crime of violence, not
passion,” said hotline coordinator
Carol Leczo. “Women are condi-
tioned to be weaker. In rape cases,
they just happen to be in the wrong
place at the wrong time.”

When a rape victim calls PAAR,
an answering service open 24 hours
a day, seven days a week, requests
the victim’s name and phone
number so a hotline worker can
return the call immediately. If the
caller refuses to give this informa-
tion,.the call is connected directly
to a hot1iner's home‘. In such cases,
hotliners try to limit calls to half an
hour so they do not tie up the main

,;_;witchboai'd.

l.,.4-

All information a victim gives is
conﬁdential. '

“We inform the victim what will
happen if she calls the police and
then suggest medical help,” Leczo
said. “Then we _ answer any
speciﬁc questions about how the
rape will affect her life."

According to Leczo, most of
PAAR’s cases involve psychologi-
cal problems. Most people call
right after airape, although PAAR
has had calls years after the rapes
occured.

service, will hold a training session

“We let women make their own
decisions, whereas society makes
decisions for them," Leczo said.
“The only thing we press for is
medical attention. to check for VD
or physical damage."

Most victims call the hotline‘

before they call the police, Leczo
noted. Since September, 1975,
PAAR has had 55 calls from rape
victims. Of these, 20 were
transferred to hotline workers, 25
people called just to have someone
to talk to, and 20 called for speciﬁc
information, including legal advice.

Only 13 callers said they would
even consider calling the police,
and all others said they deﬁnitely
would.not.

According to FBI statistics, only
one in ten rapes is reported, Leczo
said. There may be many reasons
for women not reporting, one being
the common idea that police ask for
intimate and humiliating details
about rape. ' ,

“I think police are getting better
in questioning, but they have a
long way to go," Leczo noted.

If a woman wishes to press

charges. she should call police
immediately after a rape to give a
physical description of the suspect
and the location of the act, Leczo
advised. Police then can search for
him and gather evidence such as
hair or pieces of clothing, at the
scene of the crime.

Assuming the suspected rapist is
caught, physical evidence. includ-
ing samples of hair, blood and
semen taken from the victim can be
presented in court. A victim should
keep the clothes she was wearing
when the incident occured.

“We only had one case at PAAR
which led to a conviction," Leczo
said. “The man was sentenced four
to six years in a plea bargain, which
involves special conditions for him
to enter a guilty plea.”

In Pennsylvania, rape is a
first-degree ‘felony carrying a
maximum penalty of 20 years or a
$25,000 ﬁne, Leczo said.

PAAR cannot force a woman to
call the police, but they suggest a
call in certain cases, according to
Leczo. Some victims ask PAAR to
call the police for them. In other

they often encourage it.

cases, police have referred rape
victims to PAAR. ’

So far; no PAAR rape records
have been subpoenaed. But, if they
ever are subpoenaed, the victim’s
name always will remain conﬁden-
tial. Leczo said.

To train volunteers, PAAR holds
four training sessions during which
volunteers meet -with police
groups, including the Youth and

and legal aspects of rape. Most W

volunteers work two 12-hour shifts
per month. , '
We set forth our philosophy
and let the hotliner act further from
her personal experience,” Leczo
said. d We dont want a victim

Ever noticed those red and
yellow signs warning “Danger,
Radiation" and wondered if you
should run past or take the long

. route around those rooms? Or

.0 lthought you'd better schedule all

your classes in the Cathedral so you
don't have to mess with danger in
the science buildings?

Proper control of radiation on
campus is the concern of the
University's Radiation Safety Of-

‘ ‘ _ ﬁce (RSO) in Crabtree Hall.

The office is like most—buzzing
ﬂorescentlights. gray desks and a
"few plants. But one side of it looks
more like a physics lab—lots of
expensive-looking machines for
detecting and measuring radiation.

Established in the early ’60s,
RSO is staffed by Director Edward
D. Durkosh and his assistant,
Barbara C. Fasiska.

A A total of six full-time employes
in the RSO discuss reports and
‘problems with the University
Safety Committee, which consists
of 30 people headed by Chairman
Dr.. Neil Wald, a professor of
radiology.

‘First, the ofﬁce must ﬁle for
licenses allowing the use of
radioactive material from the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission
(NRC). If the NRC approves the
use, it grants the ofﬁce a four-year
license for radioisotopes and a
three-year permit for by-products.

The RSO’ must then clear anyone
on -campus wishing to work with
radiation.» -The person also must

state his needs for radioactive‘

materials. The office then insures
that the person has full under-
standing of radiation safety, after
which he becomes an authorized
user. Of the 1.50 authorized users

  It's your serve...

at Pitt, none can order radioiso-
topes until the RSO approves the
order.

All persons working near radia-
tion are required to wear ﬁlm
badges. The badge contains
different sequences of metals and
thicknesses that tell the type and

— quantity of the radiation, should it

pass through to the ﬁlm. A record‘

of each individual’s ﬁlm badge is’-2

then_put on ﬁle in the RSOvforever.

Labs are frequently checked to
ensure proper use of materials.
The isotopes commonly used in the
labs are carbon-14, with a half-life
of 5,730 years, and tritium (H-3),
with a half-life of 12.3 years.

Half-life is the time required for

the disintegration of half of an
amount of radioactive material.

Others include iodine-131 and
-125, phosphorus-32, with half-
lives of eight days, 60 days and 14
days, respectively.

There is a‘ limit on the amount of
this material that can be put down
drains, but Pitt’s labs rarely reach
this limit, Durkosh said. This small
amount would have no effect on
plant or animal life.

Responsible also _for waste
control, the RSO must collect and
process waste from the labs.

“Waste is often in the form of

tubes that have a small residual
contamination not used in the
experiment," Durkosh said.
“Liquid wastes cannot be shipped.
All wastes are processed to a solid
before transporting,” he ex-
plained.

The waste is then turned over to
a company dealing with radioactive
waste disposal, which transports it

to a burial site. _

There have nev_er- been any
dangerous accidents with radiation
at the University. Campus Police
Chief Curt Graham said the police
have received only one call for
radiation in the past ﬁve years,
because of confusion over where to
put a weekend delivery. However,
no danger was involved. Since
then the RSO has developed a
policy for accepting deliveries. A
recent Clapp Hall incident involv-
ing phosphorus 32 posed no
danger.

As for the colorfulsigns, the RSO
posts them on any room containing
radiation, even where it is not
required by the federal govern-
ment. The recent color-coding on
the signs informs what materials
are in use during. a particular
month, what is permitted to be

used and the relative hazard.

White, blue, yellow and red
stickers indicate increasing de-
grees of danger.

“The Radiation Safety Ofﬁce has

I_ a two‘-pronged effort,” said Dur-

kosh. “We are first concerned with
people’s safety, then we are
concerned with meeting the re-
quirements of the license.”

The RSO exists mainly as a
precaution, so the next time you.

government,” Powers said. “Pitt
doesn't want to be left behind.

, “In addition, emphasis now is on
multidisciplinary research, which
requires institutional proposals for
funding and not individual depart-
ment proposals,” Powers said.
The Ofﬁce of Research, according
to Powers, would coordinate the
proposals among Pitt’s various
schools and departments and
prepare a University request for
funding.

The Board of Trustees is"

currently surveying Pitt faculty's
research involvement and interests
and is studying research offices at
10 other universities.

“We’ve been talking to staff
from other research offices to see
how they function and find out
some of the mistakes and positive
contributions they’ve made," Pow-
ers said. “We’d like to start out by
avoiding ini/tial pitfalls others have
run into.”

education research, is working on
methods to improve research
management.

The Ofﬁce of Research should be
ready to go within a month,
according to Powers.

Current research at Pitt includes
adjutant cancer therapy studies,

and transportation and ‘pollution-

studies. ' ‘

Adjutant cancer research in-
volves postoperative therapy, in-
cluding chemotherapy, which is
designed to prevent and control
further spread of the disease. The
research program is headed by
Pitt’s Dr. Bernard Fisher, national
director of the Council on Adjutant
Cancer Therapy. .

Transportation and pollution
research is an interdisciplinary
study on the use of automobiles
conducted by Pitt environmental
engineers, the School of Public
Health, the economics‘ department,
and others.

Such research is necessary to

‘attract skilled and competent

graduate and faculty members to
Pitt in the future, according to
Powers.

“With a one-stop Ofﬁce of

Research, Pitt could take care of '
the problems of research funding._¢:'V

and management and help main-
tain our reputation among the
academic community.”

  Anniversary Concert-Mellow

BY M. PATRICK MON AHAN

The Pittsburgh Music Makers
Anniversary Beneﬁt Concert, held
Monday night at the Jewish
Community Center, was musically
successful in showcasing three of
Pittsburgh’s ﬁnest bands, The
Rhythm Kings, King Solomon and
the Floyd Beck band. It's just a

shame more people weren't there_

toshare the intimate atmosphere,
the friendly crowd and the tasteful
and mellow music these bands laid
down.

Beck and his band opened the
show and put the crowd into a
bluesy mood with “Ain’t Gonna
Leave you Crying.’-’ In fact, his
whole set was extremely blues-ori-‘
ented-, with Beck’s vocals ranging
from ballads to roadhouse blues,
accented with very lyrical, yet

ringing, guitar passages. . .

The highlight of Beck’s set ha
to be when the four-man Rhythm
Kings’ horn section came out to
join Beck and his band for the last
few numbers. On Al Green’s “Full
of Fire,” the horn men got hot’n
heavy with Beck’s sax player Butch
Stone, and ended with a tune they
recently recorded with Floyd:
“Have to be a Man.” «

Next came King Solomon, and

Asbury is an excellent addition to

“Nightlight.”

The sassy “Missy” and “Skip-

before “Nightlight” ended the set,
bringing the crowd down easy with
outstanding snare and hi-hat work
from Howard Bennet.

After a lengthy intermission,

Greek Play is
Myths, Dream

BY JOHN CURLEY

Medea, the current production of
the Studio Theater, is a dreamlike
sequence of events, encompassing
various interpretations of Greek
myths, with some new and very
intriguing changes made by direc-
tor Cheryl McFadden. 

As is the nature of a dream, so is
the nature of this play, a procession
of hazy, distorted premonitions,
quick, emotional actions, and
blurred images. The audience sees
Medea kill her children, and later
they see another Medea kill

‘different children in a flashback

renders us the thought-provoking-..\.:..;

imagery with which dreams often
leave us with.
There is no set pattern of action

in the p1ay—it moves and reacts as-

the action of the dream pierces the

inner emotions of the characters in

the myth and lets the audience see
an interpretation that delves deep
into the subconscious andsearches
out the significant and lasting
impressions that evolve from

interaction between the characters.

In this sense, the play deals notr

so much withthe journey of Jason, _

but with the meaning and

Such is not the case with

another one, only to further amaze
his audience.

Majors’ Success,
Sweet And Sour

BY TOM HALL
Sports Editor

“Nothing great was ever accomplished without enthusiasm”-
Ralph Waldo Emerson. \, . ’ _.

With the end of the drop-add period at the University, has anyone
wondered which bureaucracy might be the busiest on campus? My

' recent visit to football Coach Johnny Majors’ ofﬁce conﬁrmed_ my

suspicions. It is, in a word, hectic.

I waited -patiently inside the tastefully decorated headquarters of
what promises to be one of the top collegiate squads of the bicentennial
year. While admiring the assorted collection of awards, plaques,
diplomas, etc., I spotted a picture of a koala bear sitting in a tree.

3 ‘Inscribed was the motto Majors has used toiturn a 1-10 program into

one that can claim three consecutive -winning seasons and two
postseason bowl appearances.
Majors entered his ofﬁce, left to talk to one of his coaches, returned,

~ completed a telephone conversation, left to talk to" some of his players

who had stopped by, gave some instructions to his secretary and
returned once again. ' , -

Having returned from a business triplast weekend, Majors had a
few loose ends to tie_up. This, ladies and gentlemen, is the life of a
Hectic.

The coach had .a few minutes between appointments and staff
meetings to sit and appraise the 1975 season. “We had a good year
last year, and I’ve got to be pleased with the success this program has
made in just three years. Of course, we’ve got room for
improvement—there’s always room for improvement. But this squad
has shown the enthusiasm needed to develop a winning program.”

There’s that word again—“enthusiasm.”

“The Sun Bowl victory was one of the biggest things to happen to
Pitt football in a long time. But we have to set our goals higher; you
can’t become complacent, patting yourself on the back.”

Not everything is coming up roses on Blueberry Hill. With success ’

comes a little sacriﬁce. The Pitt program is no exception. Assistant
Coach Jackie Sherrill announced shortly after the Sun Bowl. that he has
accepted the head coaching position at Washington State. And last
week, offensive coordinator George Haffner packed up and left for
Florida State to join former West Virginia" University Coach Bobby
Bowden’s staff. '

‘‘I’m certainly gonna miss them,” Majors lamented. “I can’t hold
them back, and I wish them the best luck in their new jobs. They’ve
been with me a long time; they’re good people.” _

As far as replacements go, Majors is taking his time with his
selections. ‘‘I can’t say right now; there are procedures,.interviews
and other things that need to be worked out ﬁrst. I’ll have the
announcements ready in about three weeks.”

For the present, the name of the game is recruiting. From now until
February 18, the staff, including Majors, will be searching far and wide
to ﬁnd those blue-chip prospects that can be lured to Pittsburgh. After
the -18th, national letters of intent can be signed, and the
high-schoolers can be measured for uniforms.

A conﬁdent Majors smile shines through with the mere mention of
recruiting." “We have about seven players pretty well signed right
now,” he said. That leaves 23 football scholarships. “Well, right now,
we’re still looking at between 70 and 80 prospects. That’s a lot of kids
to check out in a little over three weeks, but we’re "working on it.”

There are some key Dositions to be ﬁlled for the 1976 campaign. The
fans won’t have names like Perko, Moorhead and Cozens to kick
around anymore. “We didn’t lose a large quantity of players this

' year,” Majors said. “But that doesn't mean that graduation didn’t

hurt us. We lost good, quality players, and they left some holes that
aren't going to be easily ﬁlled.” ‘
“Defensively, welost Tom Perko, who played outstanding football
for us this past season. We really need help at linebacker.
“And Randy Cozens will be gone; (Dennis) Moorhead is a gutty,
hard-nosed ballplayer." I caught the hint of a_ slight wince when he
went over those names. “You just don’t come up with players like that

NEW BRUNSWICK, N..I.—Un-
til yesterday, the Pitt Panthers
could point to their won-lost record
and be proud that although they
had lost 11 games, they had never
been blown out yet. Even that
small consolation to a dismal
season was denied them by
Rutgers last night, when the
basketball machine named Phil
Sellers led the Scarlet Knights to a
102-71 thrashing of the Cats.

Not only did the Cats have to '
contend with Sellers (17 points, 17
rebounds, 11 assists), but also they
had to deal with a matchbox-like
basketball court full of roaring,
partisan fans, bargain-basement
ofﬁciating and a guy named Eddie
Jordan.

“It was Eddie Jordan that got us
moving,” said Rutgers Coach Tom
Young. _“He helped turn the
momentum our way.”

Jordan gave the hometown fans
a dribbling exhibition that would
have made Curly Neal proud; he

_ also scored 12 points.

Before Jordan broke loose in the
second half, the Panthers were still
in the game. Down by 10 points at
the half, 41-31, the Pitt squad
appeared to have a chance to make
a comeback.

iWillie,.Kelly canned a jumper to '

open the half and pull the Panthers

From Ridl's View

within eight, but it was then -.that
Rutgers started to move.

The Knights scored six more
points before Larry Harris connect-
ed for two of his 22-points.
Suddenly, on a lay-up, Jordan
scored his ﬁrst points and started
the home team on a scoring binge
that outdid the Panthers 19-6.

"We tried to run with them.”
said Pitt I-Iead Coach Tim Grgurich
dejectedly, "and we just couldn't’
keep it up." -

With Pitt sagging steadily
behind, Rutgers began to hot dog
it, with Sellers unleashing behind-
the-back, over-the-head and over-
the-shou-lder passes to his team-
mates a la Ernie DiGregorio.

Mike Dabney, the Knights’
standout senior guard, scored 14 of
his 19 points in the second-half

outburst that drowned the Panther‘

effort.

Dabney, Jordan and Sellers led
an offense that before the game
had been ranked second in the
nation—averaging 98.6 points per
game. ~

“This is the best running we’ve
done all year,” Young said. “Our

’ kids did an excellent job of ﬁnding

the open man on the fast break.”

In the ﬁnal analysis, it was the
Knights’ fast break that really did

eFirst Rout, 102-71

the Panthers in, tiring them ou-.;»‘.-Ts,

and frustrating their best efforts. ' I

The Cats have had to deal with a
lot of adversity this year, but it is
only now that they can chalk.up one
more unpleasant experience-
humiliation.

There’s Hope In Pitt Future

BY CRIS HALL

When Leo Durocher said, “Nice
guys ﬁnish last,” he obviously had
no idea of the role that would be
played in the Pitt basketball
program by Charles “Buzz” Ridl.

Ridl, you may remember, retired
last year after turning the Panther
program around during his seven
years as head coach. And he’s the
man who made a lot of friends
doing it.

When Ridl left a successful
career at Westminster College and
assumed Pitt’s top job in 1968, he
came to a program that was very
much a loser. ’

“When I accepted the job at Pitt,
I felt like we could get to .500
quickly,” Ridl said, “But I knew
the ﬁrst year would be tough.”

Truer words were never spoken.

» Lacking not only attitude but also
talent, Ridl's ﬁrst team at Pitt lost

20 games while winning only four. .

One of those losses was to
Carnegie-Mellon University, mak-
ing the series record at the time
Pitt 101, C-MU 18.

But the 1969-1970 season proved
Ridl a prophet. The Panthers went
12-12, and the only thing that
stopped the 1970-1971 team'from a
possible postseason bid was . a
string of four season-ending losses.
It also defeated C-MU twice, by an
average spread of 40 points.

.Two.of Ridl’s seven Pitt teams

i saw postseasonaction. .One, called

by Ridl “one of the ﬁnest teams
Pitt has ever put on the ﬁoor,”
went to the National. Collegiate
Athletic Association Eastern ﬁnals
in 1974 before losing to —North
Carolina State and its ‘star player,
David Thompson_. Ridl's last squad
was invited to the 1975 National
Invitational Tournament. '

The 1973-1974 team, which
.featured Bill Knight and Mickey

-Martin, posted a Pitt record—25

victories, including 22 in a row,
while losing only four times.

After resigning his position as
head coach on good terms with
everyone involved, Ridl took on his
present position as- director of
alumni affairs at Westminster
College.

As an informed and interested
Panther fan, Ridl is in a unique
position from which to view Pitt’s
current basketball misfortunes. ‘‘I
still follow the team and have been
able to see a number of their
games."

Asked if he saw any hope in the
.Panther future, Ridl was quick to
reply, “Oh, yes. This team has a
lot of hidden talent that is just now
coming out.” Noting the team’s
heavy manpower losses and under-
lining the closeness of most
matches Pitt has lost, Ridl

The Pantherette swimming

team extended its winning streak to .

ﬁve by crushing Clarion, 79-52, last
night at Trees Hall._

Pitt took 11 of 15 events through
excellent performances by the big
three of Pantherette swimming-
Angie Lopez, Kathy Stetler _ and
Jamie Conley. ,

Stetler, fully recovered from a

weekend bout with tendonitis of the -

shoulder, picked up three ﬁrst
places: 100-yard freestyle, 200-
yard freestyle and 50-yard butter-
fly. Her timing in the latter two
events qualified her for the
Nationals, bringing her total of
competitive events to four. ‘
Lopez took ﬁrst in the 50- and
200-yard breaststrokes, and also
helped win the 400-yard medley
relay. ' V .

Conley, in another ﬁne perfor-
mance. also ﬁnished ﬁrst in three
events: individual medley, 200-
yard buttul‘; and 500-yard free,-

III I\\ U UVCIIIS.

‘‘I didn’t think we’d beat them
this badly," Pitt Coach Kate
Mathison said. “Our_ kids really
swam well. Kathy swam a super
meet.”

‘The Pitt divers were not nearly
as effective (as usual). Connie

maintains “the team’s record could
easily be the opposite of what it ‘is.

“I’m really amazed at how well
the team is playing together this
year,” he added. “These young
kids are suffering some disap-
pointments right now, but this will
help them in the future.

“It's somewhat similar to 

‘happened three or four years-ago
when we had a lot of young players
and lost a lot of close games. It was
very evident that we could play
with the best, and then came the
two very successful seasons."

No stranger to the woes that can
befall a ﬁrst-year coach, Rid_l can
understand the many problems

confronting his successor, Tim.

Grgurich. ._ *
By adjusting to these problems,

Ridl feels, Grgurich is “gaining

experience that is going to beneﬁt

‘him greatly in the future.”

“First years are difﬁcult, but I’m ,
sure there will be a lot of go 3-

things to carry over to next season.

It's a matter of patience. and

dedication.’ '

One of the factors Ridl sees in
the Panthers’ favor is student
suDDort.

“I’ve always felt that if we put a
successful and exciting team on the
floor, the students would‘ really
come out and support them.
Student support just kept growing
and growing as the years went on,
and this is what any team needs."

Another sign of support that Ridl
likes to see at the Field House is
“Tiger Paul" Auslander.

. “The students have always
seemed to respond to Paul. His
being back is a nice thing," as I

know that he lives and dies with 7"‘ ,

sports, especially basketball. He’s
a very interesting person, and I
consider him a personal friend.”

A man whose enemies at Pitt are
few and far between, Ridl has
missed the University and his old
job. but says that “so far I'm happy
with my decision to leave. I think
my decision was a right one."

“Our receivers, Karl _Farmer and Rodney Clark, have graduated, so’
we're going to have to come up with someone there, too.”

This isn’t to say that Majors is displeased with what he has coming
back. The 1976 squad looks exquisite on paper. And the players have

proven themselves on the ﬁeld. That experience, in Majors’ mind, is

their advantage.

“A lot of the guys who will be seniors this year started playing
football here when they were freshmen. We’ll have a lot of conﬁdence,
a lot of leadership. These are the men that can go out on the ﬁeld on
Saturdays and play recklessly, and still play a smart, intelligent game.

"This has got to be the tightest, most mature team this University

has ﬁelded in a long time.

These- are the guys that took over a

disastrous program and turned it around."

The Panthers should be off and running with returnees the likes of
Tony Dorsett and Elliott Walker. “Tony needsa little over 1,000 yards
next year to become the all-time collegiate rushing leader. I hope he
wins all the awards available to him, because he's a ﬁne young man.
But I know him well enough to know that Tony is a team player, and

that’s what I admire in him.

 “Eliott Walker should prove himself to be one of the best running

 backs in the nation next year.

He’s developed into the complete

player, running the ball, blocking, catching-passes. He’s got it all.”

And then there’s the quarterback.

“Robert. Haygood and Matt

Cavanaugh are both good capable quarterbacks. We’ll have a tough
decision every week deciding who’s going to start. But those two are
really close, and they support the other completely.”
Being a consensus Top 10 candidate next year has got to help your ’

recruiting. The Panthers are no longer the “breather” on anyone’s
schedule. “lt's a tougher position to be in. We have more to lose

now,’_' Majors said. .

Majors has received some offers from other universities, but he's
content in Pittsburgh. “I like the city, and I like the University. The
administration and the student body have given us the support and
enthusiasniit takes to build a winning program.”

There’s that word again.

One ‘thing I was wondering, however, I asked him. Maybe a big
fullback, like Pete Johnson, for those tough short yardage situations?

‘‘I don’t think so,” Majors replied.

"1 think we’ll just try to keep

Dorsett and Walker going and healthy.”

“Does that mean you'll stay with the veer again next season?”

” Again, that conﬁdent smile. “What would you do?” he asked.

NOTRE DAME AWAY TICKETS

Goaltenders: Atook AtpThe  

‘BY STEVE SYBERT

This "is the first of a two-part
series on professional hockey
goaltending.

Pro goaltenders always have
worn the label of being crazy over
their mass of leather equipment.
Are they really crazy? If not, then

why do they let slap -shot-happy,
forwards ﬁre pucks at them at.

speeds of up to 100 miles per hour?
I talked to a number of National
Hockey League goalies to ﬁnd out

why they became goaltenders; how -

they surviveand what they get out
of what many consider the most
excruciating position in team

sports.

“I guess the reason I got into it,”
said Ken Dryden of the Montreal
Canadiens, “is because my brother
is a goaltender. He’s six years
older than me, and I’ve always
tried to do everything he did. I'm
sure that’s why I am, but I don’t
know why in the world he is.”

Supposedly, Tony Esposito of the
Chicago Black Hawks became a
goalie to satisfy his goal-scoring
brother, Phil-, when they ‘were
young, and a junior-league team
coaxed him into making a career of
it.

“They needed a goaltender and
they kept harassing me,” he said.
“It's no fun to play goal with all
that pressure. It’s. torture. I didn’t
want to play. But it’s a job and it’s
good money. I can’t make that kind
of money anywhere else, so that’s
why I do it.”’ . I

Dryden and Esposito have good

reasons, but does anyone really

enjoy playing the position?

"‘I really like it,” said the
Philadelphia Flyers’ Wayne Ste-
phenson, “but it’s hard to say why.
I just enjoy getting in there. I used
to play forward until I was 15, then
I made the switch to goalie because
I like it better there.”

Most goalies are not as cheerful
as Stephenson when talking about
their jobs, and you really can’t
blame them. The pressures of

ve1oped_ severe stomach trouble,
from his occupation.

But, when _ confronted, Crozier
didn't exactly verify that story.

“Those stories are exagger-
ated,” said the balding,‘ 33-year-
old goalie. “The older they get, the
worse they get and the more
exaggerated they get."

Esposito feels the pressure ‘is on
the goalies today more than ever.
“I don’t know how the hell the old
goalies wentthrough thatin those
days. It was like a weekend job
almost. But the--pressure was on,
because if they let in a bad goal,
they were-under the gun.

have to live with it. During the
year, I’m two different people-
nervous in the winter and calm in

Goalies face an ever-present
battle against the pressure, not
wishing to succumb to it as
Sawchuk and Hall did. They all
have different strategies to

' overpower the thing they fear even

more than the flying pucks.

V “I try to take my mind off the
game,” said Gilles Meloche of the
California Seals. “During\the
afternoon before a game, I try to
think about something else. Then I
go to the game and‘ try to set my
mind on stopping the puck.”

UTILITY REGULATION
PREVENTS SHUTOFFS

HARRISBURG (AP)—The
Public Utility Commission today
unanimously approved a temporary
regulation to prevent utilities from
shutting off service without first
checking with the commission.

The action is meant to prevent
any repetition of a case in
Pittsburgh where a service cut off
by a natural gas giompany was
blamed for the deatli of an elderly
woman.

The PUC adopted the measure in
response to the death last week of
Sophie Easer, 70, of suburban
Pittsburgh. She was found frozen
to death in her home wher
Equitable Gas Co. had turned off
the gas Jan. 5 for nonpayment of
bills. '

Commissioner Helen 0’Bannon
noted that the action removes one
way the‘ utilities have used to force
delinquent customers to pay their
bills. She suggested that the
commission needed to‘ develop
further ground rules for disconnec-
ting service. ’ ‘ .

Commissioner James McGirr
Kelly said no one was particularly
happy with the order but the‘ PUC
had to act.

“Utilities may have to suffer
