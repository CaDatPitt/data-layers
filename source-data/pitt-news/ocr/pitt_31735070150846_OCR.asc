leaving Pitt

RJ Sepich
Sports Editor

The Pitt men’s basketball team
announced on Tuesday that two
of its betterlplayers will leave the
program.

Head coach Jamie Dixon ﬁrst
released a statement Tuesday
evening informing the public that
junior guard Trey Zeigler had de-
cided to transfer. Just a few hours
later, freshman center Steven Ad-
ams shocked Pitt fans by announc-
ing that he will sign with an agent
and enter the 2013 NBA Draft.

Adams had repeatedly told
reporters that he would return
to Pitt next season, but the New
Zealand native backtracked on that
statement with Tuesday’s stunning
decision. "

“In discussing options with my

family and Coach Dixon, I feel that

it is in my best interest to declare
for the NBA Draft,” Adams said in a

.‘ press release. “I want to thank ev-

eryone at Pitt including my team-
mates, coaching staff, the admin-
istration and the fans, who have all
supported me over the last year.”
Dixon said that he understands the

_ 7-foot-tall center’s,-decision.

“After talking with Steven and
his family,_ we fully support him in
this decision,” Coach Dixon said in
the same release. “We support him
in choosing to pursuehis dreams

and in having the opportunity to ‘

provide for his family back in New
Zealand. We will continue to stay
involved in the process and he will

Pitt conﬁrms
-Rushel Shell
transfer news

RJ Sepich
Sports Editor

Pitt football head coach Paul Chryst

conﬁrmed rumors on Tuesday that,

star sophomore running back Rush-
el Shell has decided to transfer.
.“Rushel and I met on Tuesday
morning, and he informed me of
his ﬁnal decision to transfer,” Chryst
said in a brief statement. “I wish him
only the best moving forward. Out
of respect for Rushel, his family and
his privacy, this will be my ﬁnal com-

A ment on the matter.”

There has been no official word
on where Shell will transfer, al-
though many expect him to move
outWest, possibly to a Pac-12 school.

The NCAA’s transfer rules allow
Pitt to give Shell a list of schools he

. cannot attend while maintaininghis

scholarship next season, and the list
reportedlywill include all of the ACC
schools thatwill be inPitt’s next con-
ference. If Pitt blocks the school to
which Shell decides to transfer, he
must pay his tuition next year.
After a record—breaking high
school career at Hopewell High
School inAliquippa, Pa., Shell rushed
for 641 yards and four touchdowns
as afreshman at Pitt last season. He
was expected to replace graduating
senior Ray Graham as the Panthers’
starting running back next season.
Junior rusher Isaac Bennett
will be the leading candidate for

I the starting running back position

when the Panthers welcome ACC-
foe Florida State to Heinz Field on
Labor Day to open the 2013 season
—— the University’s ﬁrst in the Atlan-
tic Coast Conference. ﬂ

STUDENT GOVERNMENT

Board majority votes to
extend Readership Program

Mahita Gaj anan
S taff W riter

The fate of the Collegiate Readership Pro-
gram has been determined for the next
year, and the Student Government Board
has decided on an extension.

At the weekly public meeting Tuesday
night, the Board members voted on the
status of the readership program before
a room of about 20 students gathered in
Nordy’s Place of the William Pitt Union.
During the hour—long meeting, the Board
— responsible for allocating the more than
$2.3 million Student Activities Fund ——
also focused on developments that came
about in the past week, including a conﬂict
between the Board and the Elections Com-
mittee and the Zulema Street ﬁre.

The Board voted to extend the Collegiate
Readership Program for the next academic

year. The program grants all non—College
of General Studies Pitt undergraduates free
on—campus access to 300 copies of USA
Today and 300 copies of The New York
Times each weekday. Board member Mike
Nites was the sole dissenter.

Board President Gordon Louderback
said that after months of discussions and
student surveys regarding the future of
the program, the Board felt ready to vote
on extending it for the next year. The mo-
tion to extend the program for the next
academic year passed, and students will
have access to the daily newspapers until
the 2014 Board reconvenes next April to
decide whether to extend the program into
the 2014-2015 academic year. i A

The motion to pass the program came
with a few amendments. The Board pro-

MAYORAL ELECTION

City controller drops mayoral
election bid, endorses Wagner

Pat McAteer
News Editor

City Controller Michael Lamb withdrew
from the Pittsburgh mayoral race Monday
and endorsed fellow Democratic candi-
date and former State Auditor General
Jack Wagner. ‘

During a brief statement in his Green-
ﬁeld campaign office, Lamb, who received
the Allegheny County Democratic Com-
mittee’s endorsement, said he and Wagner
share the values instilled in them through
their Pittsburgh upbringing.

“Jack Wagner is both a friend of orga-
nized labor and of Pittsburgh’s business
community,” Lamb said. “And as someone
who grew up in the same community as
me, he understands that We needto focus
on our communities, as growth in all our

neighborhoods helps us all.”

Lamb’s announcement essentially
transforms the mayoral race into a two-
person contest, since he and Councilman
Bill Peduto have out-fundraised the may-
oral race’s two other candidates, State
Rep. Jake Wheatley, D—Allegheny, and
bus monitor A._]. Richardson, by a wide
margin thus far. '

In light of Lamb’s announcement, a
reinvigorated Peduto said in a press re-
lease that the choice for Pittsburgh’s next
mayor is now clear.

» “We have built a new coalition of peo-
ple who understand what Pittsburgh can
be,” Peduto said. “I’m looking forward to
continuing to earn the support of voters
all over the city and working to reach this

AID President Viveka Mandava con-
demned Khan—Yousufzai’s actions in an
email and said he wasn’t affiliated with AID
or the No Sweat Coalition.

“Although Americans for Informed De-
mocracy (AIDPitt) is currently working to-
wards affiliation with the WRC, we were in
no way involved with this student’s actions
and absolutely condemn such vandalism,”
Mandava said. “As far as we are aware, the
individual in question has never attended
our meetings or been a part of our cam-

paign.”

The grafﬁti painting was made with blue
and black spray paint and measured about
12 feet by 4 1/2 feet. Police also conﬁscated
a black Sharpie marker and a 450 milliliter
bottle of perchloric acid from Khan-Yousuf—
zai at the time of his arrest. What he planned
to do with these items remains unknown.

Many students were unaware of the van-
dalization of the Cathedral, as it had been
restored to original condition by Monday
morning. ’

Sophomore Ashley Byrne, a communica-
tion science and linguistics major, said she
was unaware of the graffiti until reporters
from local media outlets emerged Monday
morning talking about it. ’

“Reporters came out of the Cathedral
Monday morning and said that all of the

grafﬁti had been cleaned off the wall and
there were no signs of it ever being there,”
Byrne said.

Another sophomore, Kelli Edwards, a
bioengineering major, said that social net-
working kept her updated on the develop-
ing story. .

“The only reason I knew it happened
was because I saw someone say something
on Twitter about it,” she said.

Edwards was also frustrated at the self-
ishness of Khan-’Yousufzai’s decision to

_ spray paint a wall in the Cathedral.

“It was pretty childish and unnecessary.
There are a lot of other ways that money can
be spent at this school rather than having to
clean up one student’s graffiti in our most
historic building,” Edwards said. I

and provide the newspapers, but decided
to remove two of the lockboxes on campus
with the lowest pickup rates in the hope stu-
dents will pick them up at the other boxes,
which will now have more newspapers in

on the lower ﬂoor of the William Pitt Union‘

vision together.”

Wheatley commended Lamb’s work
as city controller and as a candidate in
a press release, but he also said he was
prepared for the ﬁnal stretch of his cam-
paign heading into the May 21 Democratic
primary.

“As we move into the last 50 days of
this campaign, now more than ever, I am
committed to presenting the people of
Pittsburgh an agenda that will end the
politics as usual and move our city for-
ward under the premise that we will only
truly claim prosperity if all our citizens

areprospering,” Wheatley said.
Richardson, who has campaigned

‘largely as a non—'political outsider, said

he was largely indifferent to Lamb’s de-
parture from the mayoral race, though
he did acknowledge that having fewer
candidates in the race increased his odds
of winning.

Lamb’s decision to end his mayoral
campaign _is yet another chapter in an
already eventful race, highlighted by
current Pittsburgh Mayor Luke Ravens-
tahl’s decision last month to not run for
re—election. _.

Last week, Councilwoman Darlene
Harris and State Sen. Jim Ferlo, D—Al—
legheny —— who both announced their

candidacies after Ravenstahl publicly
announced his decision to not pursue
a third term —— withdrew from the race
despite receiving enough signatures to
appear on the ballot. ‘

Although March 27 was the ﬁnal day
to withdraw from the race, Lamb plans to
ﬁle a court order to remove himself from
the ballot, according to the Pittsburgh
Post—Gazette.

The candidates vying for mayor will
be on Pitt’s campus tonight for a debate
at the O’Hara Student Center Ballroom
at 7:30 p.m. The event will be hosted

OPINIONS

This January, expect America’s health 

care system to get much worse

Christy Lampe
For The Pitt News ’

Several people — including a large '

portion of Pitt students — believe
the government should involve
itself more in health care. These
* people see the President Barack
* Obama’s health care plan, which
is due to be largely instituted next
January, as a step toward better
. health outcomes. _
But prior to leaping happily into‘
a new government panacea, I’d like
6 to warn you as to why this future
may not be so healthy.

First, one of the basic premises
of government involvement, that
health care is a “basic right,” is
deeply ﬂawed. .

If you look to our Constitution
or Bill of Rights, you will ﬁnd free-
domsllof speech, property, worship
and gun ownership listed, but not
health care. A It is also important

. to ‘note that when our founding
fathers wrote these documents, we
had doctors and hospitals. Health

"care existed, but they believed the
government had no legal authority
or responsibility to control it.

But even if you don’t agree with
this, and you think government
should involve itself, there are sev-
eral reasons why intervention fails.

4. First, a more market-based sys-
tem would not signify that only
the rich receive health care. Since
1986, emergency care has been
provided by charity under federal
law, and free clinics for routine
care have existed since the early
1960s. The rich arguably receive
better health care, but the rich
typically consume higher—quality
products, drive nicer cars and live
in more lavish homes. This does
not mean the poor and middle
class do not have cars or homes,
or that these versions are less safe
or effective; they simply own dif-
ferent versions.

Second, high health care costs
will only continue theirupward
spiral. It’s absolutely absurd to
think the government is capable
of driving down the cost of health
care. If nothing else, government

0" has proven that it is ’total1y"incom—* 6‘

petent when it comes to trimming
almost any expense, from health
care to construction. V - .

Proponents of socialized medi-

cine love to point to Europe and
Canada as superior models. While
Canadians receive “free” health
care, a study by the Fraser Insti-
tute, a nonpartisan group, found
that 46,159 Canadians sought
medical treatment outside of Cana-
da in 2011. Despite having access to
“free” health care, Canadians were
willing to pay for outside care.

Further, a study by The Com-
monwealth Fund found that 41
percent of people in the United
Kingdom and 33 percent of people
in Canada had, to wait four months
or more for nonemergency sur-
gery compared to only 8 percent
in the U.S. .

More alarmingly, Clare Gerada,

It’s absurd
  to think the
government
is capable of
driving down
the [cost of
health care.

the chair of the U.K. Royal Col-
lege of General Practitioners has
openly admitted that it is “OK for
people to be denied health care
if they have unhealthy lifestyles.”
In the eyes of the government, if
a person smokes, his or her life
is somehow less valuable than a
nonsmoker. Gerada openly admits
this is because ofsﬁnancial con-
straints within the national health

. service. But this is a small consola-

tion to an uncle or grandfather who

_ ﬁnds himself in the early stages of
lung cancer. These government-

imposed health quotas will be far
more restrictive than anything
scrounged up in the private sector.

Some people accept the above
facts, but believe that since Obam-

'acafé"allbW§‘tH0"se"with current ‘

coverage to keep their existing
plans, this will prevent these ills
from invading U.S. health care.

5 But while the letter of the law sug-

gests this is true, a recent study by

McKinsey 8: Company consulting’,

ﬁrm estimated that 30 percent of‘
1,500 surveyed companies would
develop ﬁnancial gains by drop-
ping their employees’ health care
beneﬁts under Obamacare. This is
because one of the stipulations of
the plan states that any employer
with 50 or-more employees must
provide “minimum coverage” or
pay $2,000 per employee to the
government. More government
care will undeniably be provided

for these citizens as citizens fall“

off private health-insurance plans.

Obamacare’s devastating im-
pact falls most heavily on our gen-
eration. An actuarial study by the
Heritage Foundation found that
premiums for persons ages 18 to
24 are expected to increase by 45
percent under Obamacare. Ad-
ditionally, because Obamacare is
adding 20 million people to Medic-
aid, less money will be available for
education. This is because states

are already suffocated by current _

entitlements for Medicaid and
the addition of 20 million people
will cause state budgets to redi-
rect funds away from education
to fund medical costs. Further, the
Congressional Budget Oﬂice now
estimates that the ﬁrst 10-year cost
of Obamacare will be approximate-
ly $2.6 trillion. Our generation is
already crushed by the burdens
of poor decision making and ir-
responsible spending elsewhere

in government; adding a growing --

$2.6 trillion liability is something
we cannot afford. .

The desirable attributes of
Obamacare, such as coverage un-
der your parent’s plan until you’re

26 years old, could still be achieved 1

  
 

— and at a lower cost — through
the free market. If we really want
to make health care accessible, we
would reduce regulations and al-

low the free market and consum-

ers to choose their care. Where

this_ happens in medicine, 

already see costs coming down.
One example is Lasik eye surgery,
which has gotten cheaper every
year, with costs dropping about 30

percent overall. The same‘ is true ”

for cosmetic surgery, which, after
adjusting for inﬂation, has also de-

creased incost. These procedures — which
insurance typically doesn’t cover and are
-therefore subject to market forces and ba-
sic supply—and-demand principles —-— prove
we need more market behavior, not less, to
improve health care.

The irony of the health care bill is that it’s

designed to reduce costs, yet the best way.

 to reduce cost is to allow a free market and
competition to ﬂourish. Obamacare, it ap-
pears, will instead likely be another example
of more government involvement leading to
a more expensive process for all. I

To the editor:

Yesterday’s editorial, “Slate system det-
rimental to SGB elections, campus” states
that “megaslates should be disallowed in
future SGB elections”-and “the slating sys-
tem, in general, should bepbanned from
Pitt’s student elections.” To support this ar-
gument, the editorial suggests a ban would
encourage candidates to run on their own

merits, give those less connected on Pitt’s‘

campus a chance at being a Board member
and promote students with personal com-
mitment and discipline to the Board. While

LETTER TO THE EDITOR

I would agree that these are all things that
could be improved upon in our SGB, the ed-
itorial calls for the wrong means of reach-
ing this end. By calling for the banning of
slates, the editorial is calling for a ban on
liberty. This same argument once took

place in America’s history, with the ‘most

notable explanation in James Madison’s
Federalist Paper No. 10. The argument is
that people form factions (in SGB’s case,
slates) that are focused on beneﬁting those
in the group, oftentimes at the detriment of

those.outside of the group. But Madison’s V

solution is not to ban ifactions, foripthat

would be a restriction on citizens’ liberty
to associate with other citizens. Instead,
the solution is to have a more benevolent

faction form to counteract the evil faction.’

In SGB’s case, the solution is not to change
the system, but instead to have the person-
ally committed and disciplined students
form their own slates and use the system
to their advantage.

For Liberty,

RJ Sepich
Sports Editor

In the hectic landscape of constant change
throughout collegiate athletics, sometimes
the answer to adversity can be a rather sim-
ple concept: stability.

Despite struggling through back—to-back -

winless seasons in Big East play, Pitt had
an opportunity to go against the trend of
quickly dismissing faltering coaches and
provide needed support and stability to its
women’s basketball program by allowing
head coach Agnus Berenato to return next
season.

There are several reasons why I believe
Coach Berenato should have been retained:

Berenato is a proven winner

With a victory over Mount St. Mary’s ear-
lier this season, she became the all—time
winningest coach in Pitt_ women’s basketball

. history, a feat that should not be scoffed at.

She ﬁnished with a 161-149 record.

Just a few short years ago, she recorded
four consecutive 20—win seasons with the
Panthers and led the team to the postseason
for ﬁve straight years, which is even more
impressive, considering Pitt owned just two
postseason berths as a program before the
Berenato era began in 2003.

And prior to coming to Pitt, Berenato

if compiled a combined seven winning seasons

as the head coach of Rider University and

Before the Panthers pulled off the undesir-
able feat twice, it had been almost a decade
since a women’s team in one of the major
conferences went a full season without a win
in league play. Providence failed to win a Big
East game in the 2004-2005 season, and head

coach Susan Yow was immediately replaced. , —.~_»

Coach Agnus Berenato, known for her
“ﬁred—up” personality, has proved she can
be a ﬁne coach. By leading the team to con-
secutive Sweet Sixteen appearances in 2008
and 2009 and its ﬁrst ﬁnal ranking in the
ESPN/USA Today and AP polls (2009), she
put Pitt women’s basketball on the map. It is
without question that Berenato is the greatest
women’s coach the Panthers have ever had.

But things wereno longer falling into
place for her, and it’s» time for a change in

Wrong way

The program has been heading in the
wrong direction for the past three years and
has failed to show any signs of improvement.
Ending this season with a 17—game losing
streak, the Panthers ran their conference los-
ing spell to an incredibly terrible 36 games.

By the time Pitt plays its next conference
matchup as a member of the ACC with a new
head coach, roughly only 25 percent of the

Once ‘again, head injuries recently’

materialized at the forefront of news in the
sportingworld. A

All of Pittsburgh’s hockey fans let out a
collective exhale when it was announced
that Penguins. captain Sidney Crosby
was not suffering any concussion-like
symptoms after taking a puckto the face
in Saturday’s victory over the New York
Islanders — the team’s 15th consecutive
win.‘

But some aren’t so lucky. '

A Russian hockey player died on Sunday
after suffering a hit to the head in a playoff
game in Kazakhstan.

Dmitri Uchaykin, a forward for the
Kazakh club Ertis Pavlodar, took a violent
hit I_—— reported as a “violent charge” by
Euro_hockey.com —— to the head from
 hockey club forward Donatas
Kurneliauskas during their semiﬁnal last
Wednesday. While original reports said
Uchaykinleft the ice on his own power and
went home, he lost consciousness the next
day.

He was rushed to a local hospital but was
pronounced dead of a stroke. He died at the

age of 32 and leaves behind a pregnant wife
and young daughter.

In the NHL, all the fuss this season has
been about visors and Kevlar socks after a
series of gruesome injuries.

A month ago, New York Rangers
defenseman Marc Staal took a deﬂected
slap shot to the eye and ' still hasn’t
returned. In February, Ottawa Senators star .
defenseman Erik Karlsson had his Achilles
tendon sliced by Pittsburgh forward Matt
C_ooke’s skate in what has been described
as a freak accident by some and a malicious

intent to injure by others.

The t\No,_Vs,cary scenarios convinced

several athletes —-— including Pittsburgh

assistant captain Brooks Orpik — to wear
visors on their helmets, and some players
switched to cut-proof Kevlar socks.

But Crosby wears a visor, and that didn’t

help his inow—broken jaw when Orpik’s_m

deﬂected slap shot hit him in the face.

Pens fans everywhere immediately
feared another concussion and another
promising season ruined. But following
Uchaykin’s death, perhaps the NHL is

focusing on the wrong thing. ﬁt

checks.

The National Football League has
recently come under criticism for
implementing new rules in order to cut
down on head‘ shots and concussions.
Although I disagree with much of what
the NFL is doing, you must applaud the
organization’s direction in this matter. ’

Concussions are a hot topic now, and
the Ni.'j‘L is doing what it can to minimize
the damage. The NHL, like the NFL, has
addressed this issue, but the results have
been inconsistent and criticized, and the
paltry suspensions handed out have been
mocked as “Shanabans,” after. NHL Director
of Public Safety Brendan Shanahan.

‘In 1968, Minnesota North Stars center
Bill Masterson died after getting checked
by two defensemen, falling backward and
cracking his helmetless head on the ice.
Despite this, it would be 11 years until the
NHL grandfathered in a, helmet rule for
players. A

Hockey players and -die-hards are a
proud bunch; hockey is a tough sport played
by hardened and tenacious men. Change

_ doesn’t come easy — many people fought

the implementation of shooto_uts because
it “wasn’t real hockey” and don’t believe
in Shanahan’s job because the game should

be “policed by the players,” meaning if you
cheap shot our guy, be prepared to drop the
gloves and ﬁght. 1

The NHL needs to implement stricter
penalties, longer suspensions and possibly
even player bans. .

There is no place in the NHL for players
such as pre-reformation Cooke, who used
to have an apparent penchant for cheap
shots around the cranial area.

The league believes he has changed, but
not everyone is convinced," judging by the
mixed reaction to the Karlsson injury.

But if Cooke slips up again with one
more errant » elbow to an unsuspecting
player’s dome, he should be gone. For good.
Same with goons such as Rafﬁ Torres and
Sean Avery. C

You target a player’s head, and, poof, g

you disappear from the game. Forever.
But it shouldnft stop there.

Oifensive players need to keep their.

heads up while they skate. You would think
that —- taught at the basic levels of hockey
— this "would be’ a no-brainer. But like
tackling with your head down in football,
some of the basics are lost on the players at
the highest level of a sport. D _

g Unpopular changes  and strictly
enforcing the rules —'— no matter the culprit

Q FROM PAGE 11
the University when the Panthers last won a
conference game in 2011. The team has also
struggled in nonconference play.

And there’s no indication things would
have gotten better under Berenato.

The recruiting situation looks grim for
next year, and the roster currently only has

~-10 scholarship players. There is no one to

bring in for depth on next year’s squad, nor
are there any cream—of—the-crop prospects
coming in to push Pitt back to respectability.

Recruiting is the backbone of any quality
college sports program, and the Panthers’
bleak prospects on this front show that Pitt’s
appeal to star high school players dropped
with the team’s slide in the past few seasons.

No more excuses

Two years ago, the team only returned
one starter, Ashlee Anderson, from the 2010-
2011 squad, which at the time was one of the
youngest teams in the country. So last year’s
winless struggle could have been expected
with such a young lineup competing in a
Big East conference full of veteran teams
like Connecticut and Notre Dame. And, in
response, Pitt brought in the best recruit-
ing class in its history — ranked No. 18 by
ESPN — to replace the lost seniors.

But through two whole seasons, Pitt’s
highest-rated recruiting class couldn’t even
manage a single victory in the Big East.
Something must be wrong.

The team is not terribly young anymore. ’

This year’s squad featured four juniors —
Anderson, Abby Dowd, Asia Logan and
Marquel Davis — some of whom have been
in the program for three or four years and
have experienced a winning season. The
team also had four talented sophomores,

including star guard Brianna Kiesel, who

averaged 14.6 points per game —- higher
than any member of the men’s team — and
scored more than 20 points in six contests
this season. She even earned an All—Big East
Honorable Mention.

Yet, with this experience and talent on the
roster, the team could not tally a single win
in league play. That can’t happen.

Time for change

Sometimes even when the talent is there
and a quality coach is in place, things just
don’t work out.

That is exactly what happened on the
court at the Petersen Events Center for the
women’s basketball program the past two
seasons. »

Berenato is a great coach and an even
greater person who found success in the
program many years ago. She has a roster
full of talent and rising potential. Despite

A this combination, Pitt must look back more

than two years to ﬁnd its last conference win.

The relationship was no longer work-
ing out, and Pitt did the right thing to tell
Berenato, “It’s not you, it’s me,” and move
on with its program.

With Pitt shifting to participate in the
ACC next season, there is already a feeling
of change drifting through all of the Univer-
sity’s athletic programs. Teams will prepare

for a new style of play against new programs

in new cities.

And by changing the head coach, Pitt may
be able to resurrect the women’s basketball
team to its successful identity of the mid-
2000s and possibly give 6-foot—11 redshirt
freshman center Marvadene “Bubbles” An-
derson a team to compete with in her next
four yearsof eligibility.

Coach Berenato will always be loved for
everything she did for the Pittsburgh com-
munity both on and off the court. But two
winless seasons in conference play cannot
be — and thankfully weren’t — accepted.

Georgia Tech.
That kind of coaching pedigree doesn’t
E’: écome around often, and Pitt may struggle to
ﬁnd a replacement with as much experience
and passion as Berenato.
She is undoubtedly the best coach Pitt
has ever had. So why let her go?
It’s understandable for fans and the ath-

 _ letic department to see back—to—back win-

" less seasons as unacceptable, but her past
successes were nothing short of incredible.

Berenato was a great ambassador for this
University

While some have begun to question her
coaching, no one can question how much
Berenato cared about her players, the sport
of basketball and the University of Pitts-
burgh. '

After every home game, Berenato
thanked the fans for coming, talked about
the game and previewed upcoming contests.
While that did not excuse the recent bout of
losing, it showed that she took responsibility
for her team’s performance and genuinely
cared about supporters of the program.

Her support for causes that beneﬁt breast
cancer research was also commendable.

And earlier this season, junior forward
Asia Logan told me that she considered her
former coachto be a kind of mother ﬁgure to
her after Coach Berenato recommended that

Logan get season—ending shoulder surgery
in 2012. The surgery helped a more healthy
Logan to become one of the team’s best play-
ers this season. _

Those kinds of personality traits are so
rare in modern college coaches.

Pitt might ﬁnd it difficult to replace some-
one who cared so much about not only the
women’s basketball team’s on—the—court
performances, but also how the program
represented and was received by the com-
munity.

Berenato has shown before that she can
rebuild a program

She quickly transformed Rider into a win-
ner. She helped Georgia Tech gain respect
in the ACC, the same conference Pitt will

enter next season. And most importantly,
when she arrived at Pitt in 2003, she took
over a team that had one winning season in
its past eight campaigns. Within a few years,
she not only had the Panthers winning, but
she had them consistently in the top 25 and
competing for postseason honors.

Sure, her recent recruiting efforts have
not been strong, but she once discovered
hidden gem Shavonte Zellous — who gradu-
ated in 2009 and recently became a WNBA
champion with the Indiana Fever — so her
track record shows that she canrecruit. And
with a 6-foot—11 redshirt freshman center in

Marvadene “Bubbles” Anderson coming into ‘
the team next year, Berenato could have con- 1

vinced talented high school players to join
Anderson at Pitt and start fresh in the ACC.

Pitt fans will never ﬁnd out whether she
would have rebuilt the program or not, but
Berenato deﬁnitely had the ability and ex-
perience to do it again.

Good coaches don’t suddenly forget how
to coach

By taking a once—dormant women’s
basketball program to the unprecedented
heights of the Sweet Sixteen in the NCAA
tournament in back—to—back seasons, some
of her most ardent supporters would argue
that Berenato earned the right to leave Pi
on her own terms. ‘

Regardless, I think every Pitt women’s
basketball fan is thankful to have had Coach
Agnus Berenato patrolling the sidelines at

the Petersen Events Center for the past de-

cade. i

always be a part of the Pitt Basketball family.”

Although Adams didn’t quite live up to the
hype surrounding his arrival at Pitt —— averag-
ing just 7.2 points and 6.3 rebounds per game
this season — he did earn a Big East All—Rookie
Team selection, and ﬁgured to play a huge role
in the team’s ﬁrst season in the ACC.

In the press release discussing Zeigler’s
decision to transfer, Dixon also declared his
support of the player.

“We will assist Trey in ﬁnding the best situ-
ation for him to reach his goals both academi-V
cally and athletically,” Dixon said. “He’s a great
kid, hard worker and good player. We thank
Trey for his contribution to our program over
the last year and wish him much success in
the future.”

Zeigler leaves Pitt after one season as a

Panther following his transfer from Central ‘
Michigan last summer. He averaged 4.4 points '

and 2 rebounds per game.

The 6.—fo’ot-5 guard becomes the sixth Pitt .

men’s basketball player to leave the program

' in the past two years after J._]. Richardson,

Isaiah Epps, Khem Birch, John Johnson and
Malcolm Gilbert. Adams, who followed suit in
his transfer, makes the seventh player to leave
the program.

The announcements leave Coach Dixon with
four open scholarship spots'to ﬁll before the
new season. I ‘
