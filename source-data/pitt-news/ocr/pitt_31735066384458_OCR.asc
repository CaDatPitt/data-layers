Pitt News Staff Writer

A proposal to create a dual major
in business for students in the
College of Arts and Sciences (CAS)
headed discussion at yesterday’s
CAS Council meeting.

Council members, who have
already given preliminary approval
to the proposal, were expected to
vote on the issue yesterday, but
decided to discuss the proposal

’ further before handing down a ﬁnal

decision.

If enacted, the proposal would
allow students to obtain a degree in
business along with another CAS
degree. ,The major would consist of

Some 230 persons were tested for

last Friday at the Pittsburgh
National Bank on Craig Street, in a
program sponsored by Pitt’s Circle

of a nationwide project by the

49 credits with 15 of these credits
taken in the CAS economics
department, three in the computer
science department, 17 in courses
cross-listed between CAS depart-
ments and the Graduate School of
Business (GSB) and 14 in courses
offered solely in the GSB. Since 14
non-CAS credits would be taken (12
is the maximum allowed), 122 CAS
credits would be needed to graduate
instead of the usual 120 credits.
CAS Dean and Council chairman
Robert Marshall expressed dissatis-
faction with the proposal.
“Procedurally, I can’t put the
decision’ together with what we
should do with undergraduate

developed by a Miami doctor who
termed it the “Save-A-Life”
program.

“The project was a great
success,” said Nat Cohen, Circle.K
project chairman. “57 people were
tested as having high blood
pressure, but 23 of them were either
unaware of their condition or were
not under a doctor’s care. That was
our whole purpose, to inform

education,” Marshall said. “Iidon’t I‘

know how we can deal with it. I
don’t know how we can vote on one
part of the package when the other
half hasn’t been completed yet.

‘ ‘From a philosophical viewpoint,
l’ve always had such funny
problems talking about undergrad-
uate education,” Marshall said.
“People assume I'm ﬁrmly against
professionally-oriented programs
being introduced into a undergrad-
uate program. This is a funny
assumption. I just think a business
major in liberal arts education is
absurd. We have to work with the
individual schools. We could be

According to Cohen, most of the
people tested were patrons of the
bank, a mixture of elderly persons
and students. The project was
geared for the Oakland area “to do
something vital for the commun-
ity,” he stressed.

‘ ‘The reason behind it is that high
blood pressure is a serious,
potentially lethal condition that has
reached epidemic proportions in
this country,” Cohen said.

Chancellor to Present
Case For More Funds
At Pa. Budget Healing

By RICH HARRY
_Pitt News Staff Writer

Chancellor Posvar and several high-ranking University administra-
tors travel to the House budget hearings in Harrisburg today to urge
state lawmakers to reverse recent trends of low priority funding of
state-related universities and increase Governor Shapp’s hold-the-line
budget recommendation for Pitt.

In the hour-long session Posvar will ask House members to increase
the Govemor’s proposal of $60.5 million, the same amount Pitt was
tagged for last year, and bring it closer to this year’s request of $70.9
million.

Posvar’s statements today are expected to follow closely those
contained in a formal University budget presentation circulated to
General Assembly members.

The Chancellor’s message in the presentation states, in part, that
continued lack of state support to higher education would further
adversely effect academic programs and preclude several middle- and
low-income citizens from attending Pitt and other state-related
universities. Pennsylvania has the highest level of tuition for public
higher education.

Posvar also will call on the General Assembly to make an about-face in
votingtrends, terming commonwealth support of higher education
“imperative” and a “priority public investment” that provides
wide-ranging beneﬁts for the state, the message says.

‘ ‘I suggest that higher education. . .has served Pennsylvania well, has
provided an effective return on the public investment and deserves a
truly higher priority in the allocation of state financial support, ’ ’ Posvar
states in the budget message. '

Should the Legislature pass Shapp’s recommendation intact, it would ‘

mark the third consecutive year Pitt will receive no increase in
appropriations, which ﬁnance roughly one-third of the school’s
operating costs.

Pitt and the other state-related universities—Penn State, Temple and
Lincoln—are placed under ‘ ‘non-preferred’ ’ status, and could be denied
top priority in the state’s budget. A recently introduced bill, however,
would put the schools on “preferred status,” allowing their
appropriations to be passed by a simple majority in the Legislature. A
two-thirds majority vote in both chambers is currently required.

Today’s session, to be followed later this month by a similar meeting
with the Senate, will include Pitt’s senior staff, Student Government
Board president Josh Baylson and Richard Pratt, chairman of the
University’s Senate Budget Policies Committee.

The hearing, scheduled to begin at 11:30, will be followed by a joint
press conference called by student representatives from the
state-related universities.

The representatives are expected to issue a statement authored by
SGB member Dave Hesidence.

Eliminate Insanity Plea, Prof Says

By The Associated Press

TOWSON, Md.—David Berkowitz, the accused Son of Sam
killer, might have stood trial on murder charges by now, instead of
undergoing a batch of psychiatric examinations, under-criminal
justice changes proposed by a Towson State University professor.

Richard E. Vatz, assistant professor of communication arts and
sciences, said the insanity plea should be eliminated from ‘the
courtroom, along with psychiatric evaluations in determining an
accused person’s competency to stand trial.

In a paper prepared for this week’s meeting of the Academy of
Criminal Justice Sciences in New Orleans, Vatz said that such
changes would “produce a more effective, more just, more
respected and more humane system of criminal justice.

The paper is co-authored by Lee S. Weinberg of Pitt.

By eliminating psychiatrists and their testimony from the
courtroom, Vatz explained, accused persons, such as Berkowitz,
would able to stand trail for their crimes, be cleared or convicted,
serve any penalties and then be released from prison. They would
not be involuntarily committed to mental hospitals.

By The Associated Press

CORSIER SUR VEVEY, Switzerland—A Europe-wide search for
the body of Charlie Chaplin has turned up nothing and Swiss
investigators said Thursday they are mystiﬁed over the theft of the
coffin from the village cemetery here a week ago.

Initial theories that the theft of the oak coffin and body might
have been the work of extortionists seem less likely now because
no ransom demand has been received, investigators said..

“No one has contacted the family or the autorities up to now,”
said Magistrate Jean-Daniel Tenthorey, who is heading the
inquiry. “I suppose one must be surprised that nothing has yet
developed after exactly one week.

“We had one specific piece of information which was followed
up in Italy but without results,” Tenthorey said, declining to
elaborate. He said the probe also has extended to Chaplin’s native
England following speculation that some fans had taken the body
in a perverse gesture of -admiration.

“But there is nothing new,” he said. -

Chaplin, who died Christmas morning at the age of 88, moved to
this small village overlooking Lake Geneva in 1952. He starred in
many American silent ﬁlms and early “talkies,” portraying the
cane-twirling‘ “Little Tramp.” He left an estate which has been
estimated at as much as $100 million. Local reports said royalties
are still‘ coming‘ in at the rate of $13.3 million a year.

Carter: Miners to Obey Taft-Hartley

By The Associated Press
WASHINGTON—President Carter said yesterday he expects coal
miners and operators alike to obey the law and told Attorney
General Griffin Bell to take personal command of federal law
enforcement to back an anticipated back-to-work order.

Carter told a nationally-televised-and-broadcast news con-
ference that he firmly believes a federal court order under the
Taft-Hartley Act will be observed.

“I have absolutely no plans to seek congressional action to
authorize seizure of the coal mines,” he said.

Carter spoke as government lawyers prepared their arguments
for a Taft-Hartley injunction. He said he also has asked Secretary
of Labor Ray Marshall to enlist the labor experts who studied the
strike situation to go into the coal fields and urge the miners to
return to their jobs.

While the 94-day coal strike topped his news conference agenda,
Carter also announced what appears to be a partial resolution of
the conﬂict between Ethiopia and Somalia.

ByJIMMORRISON
Pitt News Staff Writer

The black studies department
gave two public lectures on human
rights at Forbes Quadrangle this
week.

Dr. Carlos Brossard spoke
Tuesday night on “Human Rights
and Political Imprisonment, ' ’ focus-
ing on the case of the “Wilmington
(North Carolina) Ten.”

Brossard, a black studies assis-
tant professor, pointed out alleged
“irregularities" in the case which
led to the convictions of nine blacks
and one white for arson and
interference with medical person-
nel. ' ‘ '

On Wednesday, black studies
visiting professor Barbara Size-
more, a past committee member of
United Nations Education, Science
and Culture Organization
(UNESCO), said the United States
has a “dismal” record in support-
ing human rights.

Brossard, who taught and
traveled extensively in North
Carolina, said the Wilmington 10
case “is of a clear political—not
legal—nature . ’ ’

Brossard questioned several
aspects of the case's trial and
post-trial proceedings, including
jury selection, credibility of some
witnesses and the integrity of the
prosecutor in the case.

Among other things, Brossard
claimed the case reflects a
“repressive” one-party system in
North Carolina “which has guaran-
teed the absence of pluralism; ’ ’ that
the “10,” particularly Reverend
Ben Chavis, were probably “used
as an example” and may be in
prison “not for what they did but for
what they believe.” He added that
the Carter administration should
concern itself with possible political
prisoners in this country before
condemning other nations.

Sizemore told the audience that
the United States is “in a scramble

to get back into a decision-making
position” in UNESCO after tempor-
arily withdrawing its support in
1974 when UNESCO imposed
sanctions on Israel for alleged
racism.

“But the U.S. has failed to
address the problem of apartheid
and racism in Africa,” she said.

Sizemore added that our coun-
try’s “non-participation” in human
rights issues is evidenced by the
fact that the United States has voted
against many resolutions designed
to combat racism, political impris-
onment and colonialism.

She also criticized United States
policy in embargoing only military
arms to South Africa.

“There is a need for those
interested in the liberation of South
Africa and in the improvement of
our country’s U.N. voting record to
organize, form pressure groups and
write letters. And now is the time to
do it,” she concluded.

CAS Delays Business Vote

very well approving a 50-credit dual
major in some departments.

‘ ‘Pragmatically speaking, ’ ’ he
said, “We have to ask ourselves if
the students really want this from
both a career and educational
standpoint. We have to ask ‘Is this
going to get them jobs? Is the
purpose of this program to. get them
jobs? Is it what the business
community wants? Is it what the
students really want?”

Student council member Joyce
Kurcina said she was afraid that
some students may believe they
were “obligated to take” the dual
major, whether they wanted to take
it or not.

“Students may think about

another student who’s taking this
type of major, ‘well, he or she’s
taking it, Ibetter take it, too. ’ You'll
almost feel obligated to take it, ’ ’ she
said.

Council member Larry Epstein,
chairman of the chemistry depart-
ment, said if a student should
decide on dual major in business
and chemistry, he would be offered
“no lee-way at all” as far as course,
load is concerned. Marshall added
that students majoring in earth and
planetary science, theater or music
face similar problems.

“To obtain a chemistry degree,
you are required to take 36 credits
within the department,” Epstein
said. ‘ ‘You are also required to take
22 courses in related courses such

as physics and mathematics, as well
as five distribution courses. If a’
person should decide to major in
business and chemistry,
many students have expressed a
desire to do, he would be required to
take 123 credits. The course load
wouldn’t be easy.”

“ 72 Years of Collegiate Journalism at the University of Pittsburgh"

Off to Hanisburg .

Chancellor Posvar is in Harrisburg today, doing all he can to
squeeze an extra $10.4 million out of a State House that really
doesn’t want to hear about it. Indications are that the Chancellor’s
jawboning will go for naught, as will the lobbying efforts of those
who will accompany him.

Pitt currently receives close to one-third of its operating budget
from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. A cut in the ap-
propriation—which is what the University has been getting for the
past three years, in the form of inflation—takes a big chunk out of
the academic and social services Pitt can provide. So far, except
for a few all-too-noticeable tuition hikes, the University"s adjust-
ment to these cutbacks has been largely outside the realm of student
perceptions.

But before long, Pitt will be unable to raise tuition anymore, and
the cuts will
provided here. If tuition goes much higher, Pitt will price itself out
of the market. Students with sufficient means will simply go
elsewhere, to colleges and universities where the education is just as
good and the tuition invoices a whole lot better. Students without

that kind of mobility will simply stay at home. -

A good many of these latter also probably will start making trips
to the state unemployment and welfare offices—meaning that if the
state doesn't shell out one way, if shells out the other.

“It’s pay me now or pay me later,” as the oil-filter-pushing auto
mechanic says, and, as in the commercial, the pay-me-later plan is
liable to be the more expensive option. The unemployment/ wel-
fare possibility, should the legislators choose to risk it, is also likely
to yield a much lower return on the dollar than the aid-to-higher-
education plan. -

However, the legislators don’t seem to have much time for these
kinds of arguments. It is the nature of politics in Penn-
sylvania—arid everywhere else—-that many of the most intelligent
choices can be made only by service-oriented legislators who are
graced with some measure of political courage. Unfortunately, it
has become painfully obvious during the past several months that
these sorts of persons do not usually win positions in Pennsylvania
government.

These, of course, are not very nice things to say. We only hope
we will have to eat our words during the next few months.

Letters to the Editor

Inequality of Advertising Rates Questioned  

Several weeks ago, The Pitt News
printed an editorial supporting the
establishment of programs that
meet the needs of the Pitt student
population. The Learning Skills
Center was created four years ago to
provide reading. and study skills
courses for Pitt students. Even
though we have exhausted about
every available resource for campus
advertising, a common complaint
from students is that they have
never heard of the service.

A major problem in advertising
our services is the cost for large ads
in The Pitt News. We have noticed
recently an increase in the number
and size of ads for speed reading
courses conducted by proﬁt-making

reading companies. These com-
panies charge our students any-
where from $195 to $395 for courses
similar to our speed reading course
especially designed for Pitt stu-
dents. The $5 fee is necessary to
cover costs of materials. And yet, as
a student service ofﬁce, we are
charged the same amounts to place
ads in The Pitt News as
proﬁt-making companies who can
write off these costs as tax
deductible expenses. Our advertis-
ing budgets will not permit this type
of promotion.

We want to bring this problem to
your attention and ask you to
reconsider an ad fee scale that is
adjusted for University programs as

opposed to outside commercial
concerns. We believe in competi-

tive advertising, but, with the 

present ad fees, we cannot
compete. Who suffers? The
students who pay much more for a
service because you are unaware
that the -same service is offered to
you on campus. Help us make
students aware of existing services
by establishing advertising costs
that are more feasible within the
constraints of University budget.

7 The Real Victims of the Coal Strike

One of the first actions in this
campaign to slander the miners
was Duquesne Light’s tearful
appeal to the Public Utilities
Commission (PUC), which resulted
in a conservation policy requiring
power cuts of 25 percent.
Duquesne Light hopes this policy
will stretch the company's stockpil-
ed coal past the striking endurance
of the miners. However, the source
of stockpiled coal is ﬁnite, and

saying it is to our beneﬁt; actually
they are not just asking us to
stretch coal supplies, but to help
them stretch the miners on a rack
until they say “Uncle” and accept
a sell-out contract.

The enforcement of power cuts is
resulting in layoffs. At Pitt alone,
student workers in the Student
Union lobby, recreation room,
Uncle Charlies, Burger Chef and
libraries have had their hours cut.

Duquesne Light has ulterior
motives in creating this scare.
Shortly after the conservation
policy was introduced, the request
for a surcharge hit the scene.
Duquesne Light requested a
three-tenths of a cent per kilowatt
hour surcharge to customers. They
said it was necessary to cover the

added expense of power purchased
from other sources. They later
lowered their request to the PUC
by $3 million.

Their conservation policy was a
scare they had created in hopes of
cashing in on the miners’ strike-a
scare that proved proﬁtable, as the
PUC has granted them a surcharge
of two-tenths of a cent per kilowatt
hour.

A footnote to the story of
Duquesne Light’s attempts to turn
public opinion against the miners
in order to take advantage of the
situation is that they themselves
are coal mine owners" (Warwick
Mine in Greene County) and a
member of the BCOA.

Although the Government feigns
neutrality, they adopted the stance
that the coal miners are obligated to
ratify the contract for the national
good, once again ignoring the
BCOA’s responsibility to the
miners. Jimmy Carter thumped his
Bible on national television as he
announced his “hopes and prayers
that God will lead the miners in
their decision (to ratify the
contract).”

President Carter has now invok-
ed the Taft-Hartley Act. The
Taft-Hartley Act does not hurt, nor
does it pressure, the BCOA.

The miners have been without
paychecks for three months. The
Taft-Hartley Act undermines the
only power that the miners and all
workers have to ﬁght the company
—the strike. To expect the miners
to accept a poor contract after they
have suffered such severe ﬁnancial
setbacks is totally absurd. There is
no act comparable to the Taft-

Hartley to force the company to

offer a reasonable contract after a
strike has effected national econ-
omic security. Clearly, this
indicates the government’s class
stand, although they never dare
speak in terms of supporting the
coal companies. The American
public is being told that it is our
patriotic duty to condemn the
miners and demand (and pray) that
they return to the coal fields.

Many of us are disgruntled by
the wage difference of our pay
compared to that of the miners, and
cannot understand why the miners
are so particular about-a contract
that raises their pay. It is not the
miners who are the cause of our low
wages. The miners are trying to
get a better deal from the coal
company, not drain other workers.

The contract now under consid-
eration is not only not the miners’
dream, but actually worse than the
1974 contract. The health plan that
caused much controversy last
summer was not significantly
improved. The mine workers must
pay high deductibles on hospital,
physician, and drug bills, while
those who have received pensions
before working a full 20 years
would have their health beneﬁts
completely cut.

Another huge pitfall of this
contract is the illegality of
“picketing or otherwise being
actively involved in causing an
unauthorized work stoppage.” In
common language, wildcat strikes
are outlawed. Wildcat strikes are
the only power miners have to
protect their own lives against
hazardous conditions and breech of

local issues.

picketors, and supportive miners)
can be ﬁred.

The BCOA is afraid of wildcats
because their proﬁts are cut when
production stops. The miners have
been receiving less and less of the
profits from what they are
producing each year. In 1969 the
miners got 49 cents in wages from
each dollar of coal mined, in 1977
they got only 36 cents. While the

price of labor has doubled in this ‘ 
time period, coal prices havens"

increased four times over.

Contrary to company assertions,
production is rising. The value of
coal mined per worker has risen six
times since 1957 and twice since
_1974. These statistics point out
that the companies have been
steadily introducing dangerous
speed-up techniques in the mines
and can well afford to give the
miners what they are asking for.

The miners work under the most ,,
dangerous conditions of any worker ~

in the United States. Ninety-nine
miners were killed in the mines
during eight months of 1977. Mines
blow up with regularity,_ coal dust
causes black lung, and cave-ins are
a constant threat.

The only control the miners have
over these dangerous conditions is
to strike for a contract that has
safety provisions, reliable health
and pension plans and the right to
strike when their lives are
endangered by unsafe conditions.

We must support the miners in
their ﬁght for a fair contract and'_

The Solution To A Hostage Mentality

By MARK_ MURPHY

For the past year, both legisla-
tors and University ofﬁcials have
claimed Pitt is merely a hostage in
the state appropriations battle.
Clearly, something needs to be
done to stave off any possibility of
Pitt’s ﬁnancial demise.

But any solution must ease Pitt’s

ﬁ dependence on Harrisburg dona-

tions, please students by not
raising tuition or cutting programs,
and delight faculty and staff by not
cutting jobs.

The solution I propose is
this: The Board of Trustees should
order Pitt’s Chancellor, Wesley
Posvar, to become a freelance
hostage, available to any person or
persons needing someone to hold
while trying to extract money.

The ﬁnancial bonanza of such an
arrangement should be obvious to
the business minds of the Board of
Trustees. A kidnapping occurs,
Chancellor Posvar is swapped for
the original hostages, and negotia-

g tions would carry on as if no change

had taken place.

The University would charge a
fee for this service, thus generating
some of the additional money
needed to run the college. While
the percentage of the ransom the
University takes can be ﬁnalized
later, Iwould suggest 30 percent to
50 percent as a fair ﬁgure.

The best elements of the
proposal are the many options
Pitt’s administrators and clients
can invoke in getting the best deal
in return for the Chancellor. Since
kidnappings and hijackings are so
popular these days, Pitt could

bank manager and demands his
three mortgages be burned. The
Chancellor arrives on the scene,
the manager is freed and thankful
for the opportunity to live, then
immediately settles with the
ridnapper. Fee: 35 percent of
ransom.

Next is the Multiple Hostage-
Medium Ransom-Deluxe Plan. In

PERS UA SI ONS

this case, the ransom could be
money, but usually it will be
asylum in another country. A great
number of hijackings fall under this
plan.

Posvar arrives at an airport, and
all passengers and most of the
crew are released. The Chancellor
then boards the plane and
accompanies the hijacker to a

predetermined country. To maxi-
mize proﬁt, the University may
demand that Posvar take ﬂying
lessons so he needn’t divide his
fee with the pilot. Fee: 50 percent
of the landing costs at the
particular airport and an escape
weekend for Posvar and his wife in
the country they land in.

Third is the One Famous
Hostage-Very Large Ransom-
Spend Time Underground Plan.
This was made popular in Italy
when J. Paul Getty III was
snatched and held for weeks.
Recently, terrorists in South
America have turned this kidnap-
ping style into an art form with the
prolonged holdings of government
ofﬁcials and big-business leaders.

Under the terms of this
agreement, Posvar would replace
the famous hostage and would be
allowed to take University work
with him. The University also

would be given a phone number at
which he could be reached. Fee: 50
percent of ransom.

The last option is the Multiple
Hostage-Very Large Ransom-State
of Siege Plan. This style has been
used of late by the Hanaﬁ Muslims
in Washington, D.C., and South
Moluccan terrorists in Holland.

Posvar would replace most or all
of the hostages and, if asked,
negotiate on behalf of the
kidnappers, at an additional
charge. Once a settlement has been

reached, the Chancellor would then
try to place the kidnappers into

foreign universities, again for an

added charge. Fee: 45 percent of
ransom; 55 percent with the two
options.

Posvar’s new role would help
University-Harrisburg relations.
Because the Chancellor would
become an actual hostage, legisla-
tors then would seem to be making
truthful statements in public.

I would, of course, be a hostage
and help the University if I thought
my presence would increase any
ransom. But, since it is unlikely the
University could, in good con-
science, ask top dollar for my
return, I offer my proposal as a
guide for others to follow.

 publish the prices it would charge
for Posvar’s services. Potential
criminals and terrorists then could
pick and choose which of the four
plans they want most.

First, you have the One
Hostage-Small Ransom-No Frills
Plan. Because he is just starting
out in the business, Posvar at ﬁrst
may have to take many of these
jobs to make a name for himself.
This is for the criminal who plots to
take one hostage, ask for little
money and promises no violence.
The criminal would not, of course,
make that promise in public.

Carter Goes to Court for Taft-Hartley Injunction

By The Associated Press

WASHINGTON—The Carter ad-
minstration sought a back-to-work
court order against striking coal
miners Thursday and President
Carter told both miners and coal
operators that he expects the law to
be obeyed.

U.S. District Judge Aubrey
Robinson set a mid-afternoon
hearing on the administration’s
request under the Taft-Hartley Act.

pared to go to court in the 94-day

strike, Carter told a nationally
televised news conference: “This is
a time for cooling off and we will do
everything in our power to ensure
that it does not become a time of
confrontation.

“The welfare of our nation
requires this difficult step and I
expect all parties will obey the
law,” Carter declared.

“I believe the coal miners to be
law-abiding and patriotic citizens, ”
Carter said at another point. ‘ ‘And I

believe that a substantial portion of
them, an adequate portion of them,
will obey the law.”

He said if “a moderate number”
of miners go back to work, “we can
prevent a crisis evolving in our
country.”

The President also said he had
“absolutely no plans” to ask
Congress to pass legislation author-
izing seizure of the strike-bound
mines.

Greek Talent Nite

 

5 
‘l A‘

By TERRI VOGT

Greek Week talent night, “That’s UN-tertain-
ment,” provided its audience with everything from
UN-plays and UN-comedies to an UN-known group of
spectators with paper bags over their heads. The only
thing missing was the gong.

Homecoming queen Donna Farey appeared as
Little Red Riding Hood when Kappa Kappa Gamma,
Theta Chi, Fiji and Kappa Sigma combined their
talents to enact a Godspell tune, “All for the Best.”
In this act, the devil created a conflict between the
big bad wolf and the mean old witch; Little Red got
too involved and was turned into a frog.

For the love of animals, Kappa Alpha Theta and
Sigma Chi featured a comedy, “Snidley Whiplash
and Dudley Do-Right.” Snidley stole Dudley's
girlfriend, sending Dudley on a vain chase. In the
end, Dudley found his true love was his horse.

Six couples from Delta Tau Delta, Theta Phi Alpha,
Alpha Epsilon Phi and Zeta Beta Tau caught a
“Touch of Fever,” the “Saturday Night” variety.
They also performed to Chic’s “Dance, Dance,
Dance,” and danced in a Soul Train lineup.

UN-humor was expressed by the Tri-Delta and Pi
Lambda Phi production of “The Bald Soprano,” an
UN-play.

After warning the audience not to laugh, Phi
Kappa Theta, Delta Zeta and Alpha Epsilon Pi
presented a comedy, “A Visit to the Doctor’s
Office." In this act, the patient’s problem almost was
solved by brain surgery with a hacksaw.

An original piano and guitar composition by Sigma
Alpha Epsilon, Delta Phi Epsilon, Triangle, Alpha
Kappa Alpha, Alpha Delta Pi and Pi Kappa Phi
followed.

The completion of another school
year, for some, means dusting off

If you discover all the sauce from the

There are 13 dry cleaning

‘Costello: More Punk Than Personality  

By KEITH BRIAN
Pitt News Staff Writer
Elvis Costello
My Aim Is True
Columbia

Elvis Costello’s “My Aim is
True” is a good album. Rock’s
“new wave” has gained its
strongest foothold with this offer-
ing.

Though the music is not new or
creative, it is strong enough to carry
the lyrics. The lyrics carry social
relevance, something neglected in
these days of “Boogie Man” and
“Poor, Poor, Pitiful Me.”

“Watching the Detectives” is an
example. This reggae rhythm tune
comments on our televised society.
“Less Than Zero” ridicules the
atrocities in today’s world; “They
traded in their baby for a
Chevrolet,” and “to me everything
is less than zero.”

The best cut on the album is
“Alison,” a slower song with less
society and more personality than
the rest.

One of the more interesting songs
is “Mystery Dance.” It’s a
Presley-type tune with some good
old rock ’n’ roll sound, but Costello
is not a Presley spin-off, and it takes
more than one listening to
appreciate what is on this platter.

First Fire
First Fire
Tortoise Records

“First Fire” is a respectable
piece. It offers a variety of sounds
and some ﬁne music. Jazzy horns,
solid guitar, ﬁne keyboards and a
rock tempo combine to produce a
clean sound.

The only weak part of the disc has
to be the lyrical content. The tunes
are an assortment of love songs that
do not say anything new.

The album's strong point is the
clean overall sound. Technical
adviser Pete Bishop may have had
something to do with this.

The best song is “Pine in the
Wind,” with nice sensual imagery,
‘excellent vocals and ﬁne piano and
percussion work.

Beaverteeth
Dam It
RCA

This is another record that isn’t
worth the paper for the label, much
less the vinyl for the disc. Its soft
rock drones on and on with little
variety in its nine love songs.

The worst cut has to be “See the
Monkey” and the best (which is still
bad) is the tenth‘ and ﬁnal song,
“Down In The Mine.”

Crystal Gale
I’ve Cried the Blue Right Out of My

Eyes

Well, maybe it’s best to say that
Crystal Gale was lucky with ‘ ‘Brown
Eyes Blue”—This album is bad. All
of the tunes are “cute country” and
show very little promise, either
musically, vocally or lyrically.

But “M.R.S. Degree,” with the
line ‘‘I Don't want no Ph.D. or
M.A., all I want is an M.R.S.
degree,” will probably soar to the
top of the charts on the country
radio stations.

Joe Ely
Honky Tonk Masquerade
MCA Records

“Honky Tonk Masquerade” is
another good album, if you like
upbeat country music.

The first cut ‘ ‘Cornbread Moon,’ ’
starts off with a homespun
footstomping sound that mellows
into “Because Of the Wind,” a
slower selection with steel guitar.

The ﬂip side contains the meat of
the album. “Fingemails” is the
song most likely to get your feet
tapping while “West Texas
Waltz,” a Butch Huckock song,
shows various uses for—of all
things—an accordian, not to
mention electric piano and steel
guitar.

Restoration comedy of manors, written

By TOBI ROSEN
Pitt News Staff Writer

‘;§ignatures” celebrated its
Pittsburgh premiere last week as
the Pennsylvania Ballet swept
through town leaving splashes of
color over the Heinz Hall stage.

Choreographed by the com-
pany’s director Benjamin Hark-
arvy, “Signatures” mirrors the
strengths and philosophy of the re-
gional repertory troupe.

The Pennsylvania Ballet, unlike
our local Pittsburgh Ballet Theater,
boasts no superstars—not a Barish-
nikov or Kirkland among the rank
and ﬁle. ' ‘

Their passion has always been
for ballets where the corps de ballet
take command, priding themselves
on the unison “Dance . of the
Cygnets” in “Swan Lake” of the
synchronized timing of mob scenes
in story ballets.

“Signatures” dares to explore
individual styles of dancers——ath-
letic, romantic, sensual'—while
creating a new mode of explora-
tion.

Ballet typically falls within two
genres. Story ballets (The Nut-
cracker, Coppelia, La Fille Mal
Garde) are designed to feature a
plot supplemented with marvalous
dancing scenes. ,

But many modern choreog-
raphers, like Twyla Tharp, discov-
ered new phrasing for dance using
rhythm and visual symmetry to
usurp our emotions.

ARTS

“Signatures” broke new ground
as it dissected space between
movements, their juxtapositioning
creating the dynamics of the piece.

Clad in brightly colored tights,
the dancers emerged in a distinct
style. Their delicately deﬁned
dancing revealed personality and
changes in mood.

The audience must have been
drained Thursday as “Grosse
Fugue” followed on the billto tax

the audience with complexity of
theme.

The Hans van Manen choreo-
graphy reﬂected the majesty of the

Beethoven score pitting four menlffﬂk»

and four women. in battles of
tension, power and submission.

Finally, it was Michelle Lucci
who captured the essence of
George Balanchine’s classical mas-
terpiece “Symphony in C”. She
ﬂowed through the second move-
ment, understanding that the
strength of Blanchine lies in the
dancers ability to choose ﬂuidity‘ as
a sign of strength.

Unfortunately, the first move-
ment fell asleep. “Symphony in C”
is not a ballet to unfold slowly, but
one which tastefully assaults the
audience with its clarity and
conﬁdence.

Though the Pennsylvania Ballet-gz
hosts a particularly young compa; " "

which has undergone major cast
changes, the uniform excellence of
quality proves ambitious choreo-
graphy need not be wasted on
inexperienced toes.:‘

‘ ‘Angel’ ’ Rock Reaches Heaven

With  Smooth Seraphic Serenade

By CINDI EVANGELISTA
Pitt News Staff Writer

White Hot’
Angel
Casablanca

Swooping in from Casablanca
Records is a body-energizing album
of rock-n-roll called “White Hot,”
by a tempting new group, Angel.

The ﬁrst side opens with “Don’t
Leave Me Lonely.” The cut starts
out at a mediocre beat but gives you
a good taste of the heated vocals of
Frank DiMino. ’ A

The rest of the songs are about
equal in musical treats for the ear,
but, while the pace gets hotter, the
rhythmic beat seems to stay the
same, and tends to get boring if
you’re the type who likes to tap your
feet to the music.

“Over and Over,” a track on the
ﬁrst side, describes best the overall
tone of the ﬁve songs, which

throughout the side.

Side two saves the album and is
what makes Angel a promising
group.

The ﬁrst song, “Got Love if You
Want It,” begins with an instru-
mental made to chill the syn-
thesizes. .The group finally
collaborates on their talents and

After this, the album improves.
Along with DiMino, the members
stretch their vocal chords and put
together a well-harmonized voice.

Though Angel can’t be compared
to the Bee Gees or the Lettermen,
the beginning of “Flying with
Broken Wings” is reminiscent of
those groups with its sharp vocal
qualities. You can ﬁnally hear

A Tale of Two Coaches, Two Programs, Two I-‘ates

The contrasting positions of Pitt coach Tim
Grgurich and ex-Duquesne coach John Cinicola were
shown by their reactions to close losses in Saturday
night’s Eastern Eight semifinals, but it was not until
this week, through the actions of others, that the
standing of each man—and each school’s
program—was made clear.

Both men were drained after efforts that fell two

points short, but their reactions were as different as
were their futures. Grgurich’s bizarre post-game
behavior was prompted by a grasp of reality so un-
sure it left him wondering where he was; Cinicola’s
serene acceptance of his fate was evidence he knew
almost exactly where he stood. ’
' Grgurich’s Panthers had been a different team
against Villanova than the one whose oft-
demonstrated inability to swallow close wins led to
cutting criticism. Grgurich and his team had per-
formed well enough to win that night, but still had
been done in, largely because of a call whose absur-
dity had to be viewed in slow-motion to be ap-
preciated.

Grgurich, with reason to wonder when fate would
cease to reserve its most cruel tricks for him, left the
floor dazed as much as drained. Pitt’s march to the
locker room resembled a funeral procession, with a
pale Grgurich offering a passable imitation of the
recently departed. .

His mood changed abruptly, however, when he
reached the locker room. It was only after he had
assaulted a locker that Pitt’s coach joined his team in
a short period of reflection. His emotions now
nearer the surface, Grgurich went upstairs to meet
the press.

He still had not gained a sure hold on his bearings;
when addressing writers, he spoke of Pitt’s basket-
ball program in third-person terms. He used the
work “they” several times in instances that would
lead most coaches to use “we.” When his curious
perspective was brought to Grgurich’s attention by

one of those writers_who thought he might have
heard a declaration of resignation, the Pitt coach
responded with a lengthy apology when only a simple
clariﬁcation was required. ,‘

It was clear that this loss had left Grgurich
searching for answers to questions he had believed he
had conquered. He had reason Saturday night to be
drained by a second-half effort that was as superb as
it was sustained; he had reason to be dazed at the
outcome that ended a season whose promise was im-

 

mense, and he had reason, above all, to believe he
had done a good job.

Before the night was over, his disappointment was
tempered by the knowledge. he’d have another
shot—perhaps a better sliot—next season. Before
the week was through, his belief in his performance
was supported by the area’s basketball writers, who
voted him local coach of the year.

Cinicola, however, had no such comforts.
Slumped in a chair outside a Duquesne locker room
whose emotional silence was violated only be muffled
sobs, Cinicola spent a long time staring at a single
white tile on an Arena wall. The tile apparently ser-
ved as a screen for the images being projected
through u/nmoving eyes, from Cinicola’s mind;
whereas Tim Grgurich could dispel today’s gloom by
looking forward, John Cinicola was able only to
reflect.

Duquesne, faced with a dying basketball program,
ﬁred Cinicola Wednesday. Though the Dukes’
decline can be attributed to disinterested alumni,
ﬁnancial impotence and a lack of quality players as
muchas it can be to anything Cinicola ever did, it is
easier to ﬁre a coach than it is to acquire alumni,
money or talent. So Duquesne athletic director Red
Manning, ignoring an 8-1-1 athletic committee vote
to keep Cinicola, ended a series of one-year contracts
by awarding a three-year term to Mike Rice, who had
been Cincola’s top assistant.

The coming seasons will not be easy ones for Rice
or Grgurich. Each will be affected by Penn State’s
recent committment to big-time college basketball.
Rice will be hurt by the fact his school no longer is
the city’s basketball name, as it was when today’s
college students were playing playground basketball
after school. Grgurich will face a schedule that does
not include as many as 10 patsies, as this season's
did. The Wheelings and West Virginia Wesleyans
will be replaced by big—name opponents; one will be
Louisville, and Louisville will not be the best.

But Grgurich will be aided by the fact his school
has taken Duquesne’s long-held place atop Pitts-
burgh’s basketball world. The schoolboys today
pretend to be Sam Clancy, Larry Harris, Sam Clan-
cy, Wayne Williams and Sam Clancy in the way they
used to take on the names Durham, Zopf, Billingy,
Davis and Barr. And, if the Dukes aren’t careful,
those kids soon will be pitting Pitt vs. Pitt’s scrubs
instead of Pitt vs. Duquesne. It could get that bad,
as anyone familiar with Duquesne’s current calamity
understands.

The calamity has passed at Pitt, however, and
good things are ahead. There are many reasons,
ranging from Grgurich to his players to fan interest
to an expanded Field House to an Ohio high schooler
with a shot that brings Larry Harris jumpers quickly
to mind. These items will be the subject of next
week’s three-part look at Pitt basketball.

Relay Rookies Off to EAIA W

ByMARIA SCIULLO ~

Pitt News Staff Writer

Every team has its rookies, but
rarely do they contribute so much so

fhioon to a team as have four

newcomers on the Pantherette track
team.

Sprinters Lisa Haupt, Leslie
Palmer, Linda Mitchell and Gwen
Murray will be among the 16 Pitt
athletes who will ﬂy to Boston
tomorrow for the Eastern Associa-
tion of Intercollegieate Athletics for
Women (EAIAW) track and ﬁeld
championships. The foursome will

participate in the 880-relay and one

individual event each.

Haupt, a Bellwood, Pa. resident,
feels that handoffs will determine
the relay’s success.

“If we can concentrate on our
handoffs,” she said, “our running

 take care of the test.”

P‘ Murray was a bit more out-
spoken: ‘ ‘If our relay puts our mind
to it we are capable of taking at least
third but of course we want first.”

So far this season, Murray has
known how. it feels to be a winner in
collegiate sports. She tied for
third-place in the Pitt Invitational
220-yard dash and is otherwise
undefeated in the event. The Butler
High graduate broke the Panther-
ette team record early in the indoor
season. Last May, she won the

Youth and versatility are two
qualities the Pitt soccer team will
retain and improve on for the
upcoming season. Freshman mid-
ﬁelder Johnny O’-Hara possesses
both these qualities. His quickness,
ball control and years of experience
(despite his tender years) have led
many to believe that O’Hara may

Whﬁeome the most outstanding
-» .,.‘cer player in Panther history.

O’Hara’s strong interest in
soccer began nine years ago when
he spent three years in England,
and was exposed to the game in an

environment where it is a national‘

Pennsylvania State Class AAA 220
championship and was third in the
100-yard dash.

Friday, Gwen will compete in the

“220 and doesn’t believe that her

freshman . status will have any
bearing on her performance.

“I’ll just look at those girls in the
other lanes and see that they have
two arms and two legs—just like
me. If I put out my 110 percent, I'll
just be ﬁne.”

Lisa Haupt is the “rookie of the
rookies” as her teammates once
kidded at practice. She began life as
a Pitt student in January and
pointed out “I’m pretty well-ad-
justed to everything here now. I’m
just ﬂoating along with the group. ’ ’

As a high school senior, Lisa (who
ﬁnished ﬁrst in state Class AA long
jump competition, second in the 220
and third in the 100-yard dash),
“had the sneaking suspicion that
someday l’d end up a quarter-
miler.”

Her ﬁrst time out in the event
broke the Pitt record and although
she had only run it one other time,
will be entered in the event at
Easterns. Looking ahead to the
competitionrshe declared “I think
it’ll be fun—well, maybe not fun,
but anyway...”

Linda Mitchell also will run the
open quarter-mile at easterns but

pastime. Now, O’Hara has a deep
knowledge of the fundamentals of
the game.

O’Hara came to Pitt from Mt.
Lebanon High School, where he
captained his team while playing
halfback. He was named all-
WPIAL for two consecutive years,
being honored his senior year as
the second-best player in the
district. topped only by Pitt
teammate Danny Hamm. He also
took all-state honors his senior year
and joined three udier Panthers
(Frank Bucci, Jerry Tomasetti and
Hamm) on the Pittsburgh all-star

team that played against the 1980

admitted that it’s not her favorite
event by a longshot. An excellent
relay runner, she anchored her
North Hills High School mile relay
to second-place in state competition
as a senior. She, too, has only run
the open 440 twice this year, both
times against Penn State’s Penny
Fales, last year’s New Jersey state
champ in the event.

This May, Leslie Palmer will be
19 years old. This will also mean
that she has been running track for
ten years. Her specialty is the
hurdles, although she is versatile in
a number of other events, including
long jump. Hurdles, she claimed,
she has “only been running for
eight years.”

Palmer, an East Liverpool native,
has established new team records in
both 50-and 60-yard hurdle races at
Pitt and should be a top contender
for the Eastern hurdles champion-
ship.

“Although I have a lot of
experience,” she said shyly, “I
wouldn’t say that I'm aiming only
for ﬁrst place...”

“If you’re aiming for a place,”
interrupted Murray, “you might as
well aim for ﬁrst because it’s just as
good as anything else, right?”

When you know how to win, you
can't argue with that.

Olympic team this summer prior to
coming to Pitt.

His ﬁrst year at Pitt found him
starting as a forward, later being
moved to the midﬁeld, and scored
ﬁve goals on the season. Much to
his surprise, O’Hara was named to
the all-East and the all-conference
teams.

‘‘It was a great honor for me to
be named to these teams as a
freshman,” said O’Hara. “I was
really surprised to receive them my
ﬁrst year in college ball.”

Also very pleased with his
playing ability last season was

coach Leo Bemis.
“Johnny was one of the best

freshman athletes to come to Pitt
in a number of years,” Bemis said.
“He was one of the most
dependable ball carriers on the
team and certainly earned and
deserved his starting position.”

O’Hara joins a number of Pitt
players who are involved with
soccer year-round. Along with the
college season in the fall, he plays
senior and summer leagues, and is
presently playing indoor soccer.

“The sport occupies 12 months a
year for me,” said O’Hara. “When
I’m not actually playing soccer, I
keep in shape with basketball and
running.”

The only thing that has O’Hara a

is a torn cartilage in his left knee.
“Iffeel the knee will have to be
operated on sooner or later, but it
has yet to give me any real trouble.
I don't think it will hamper me for
next season,” said O’Hara.
O’Hara believes the Panthers

‘will be a much improved and united

ball club next season.

“By only losing goalie Frank
Bucci, we have almost the entire
team back to make soccer develop
into a growing sport at Pitt,” he
said.

O’Hara will be one of the largest
contributors in this building pro-

“We probably play better (than
varsity teams) because we all go
out there because we want to, not
because som.e guy wants us to do
it,” said CurtHetz, a three-year
veteran of the Pitt hockey club.

Although he has no scholarship,
the ﬁnancial conditions of the club
have not improved since he
arrived, and this weekend's two
contests with Ohio State will be
played at far-away Lake Vue
Arena, Hetz has played an
increasingly better offensive game
since his rookie season when he led
the team in scoring.

With three games remaining in
this season, the 5’5" center has 19
goals and 32 assists.

Gynnasts Hope Regional Results Point to Pippin

By SUE McFARLAND
Pitt News Staff Writer

Coach Donna DeMarino and her
women gymnasts will be looking for
the road to Pippin country this
weekend as they host the EAIAW
Regional championships at the
Field House. Pippin is a variety of
apple grown near Seattle, and it is
there (the University of Washing-
ton) the Pantherettes will be headed
if they are among the top scorers at
this weekend's competition.

DeMarino believes her team can
conceivably gain a berth in the

Nationals. She explained that nine '

regional competitions will be
occurring all over the United States,
with the nine winners and the next
seven highest scores competing in

‘‘I go up about 10 assists per
year,” Hetz said. “I have a new
winger this year, Dave Elston, and
he plants himself in front of the net
and gets it in. And I've been
scoring a lot off the power play. -

“We've really built up our
defense this year,” the center
continued. “We're running a third
line for the ﬁrst time since I came
here, so we all get a lot more rest.
But our offense is still the strongest
part of our game.”

The increasing number of new

players is a big factor in Pitt's

12-8-1 record, Hetz said, because
the Panthers faced higher-quality
teams this season.

“We're playing against a lot
better competition,” he said. “It's
all college teams this year. Before,

nationals. At the present time Pitt
is seeded third in the tournament
behind defending national cham-
pion Clarion and Penn State
(currently number one in the
nation).

The optimism of the fourth-year
head coach was echoed by the
members of her eleventh-ranked
team.

“We've really been working and
everybody is really psyched,” said
leading team scorer Myra
Bachuchin, concerning the stepped
up, seven-day—a-week practices that
have been conducted the past few
weeks in preparation for regionals.

“The thing is,” said Bachuchin,
“we know that we're good enough
to do it, it's just a matter of puttingit

Curt Hetz

all together. ' ’

Bachuchin, who was the seventh-
ranked gymnast in the nation for
February, will be competing in the
all-around in hopes of qualifying for
individual competition at nationals.

Senior Cyndee Severyn, compet-
ing in three events this weekend,
has some reflections concerning
competing in her last regional
competion.

“It’s sad to know this is my last
competition and it will be hard to
face, but it's' nice to know that the
team has come such a long way and
I've been part of it."

Severyn transferred from the
University of Massachusetts after
her freshman year.

Carson Confident of Potential

By KAREN KADILAK
Pitt News Staff Writer

To say the Pitt women's
gymnastics team is super-psyched
for this weekend's Eastern Regional
Championships would be an
understatement. Pantherette coach
Donna DeMarino said Wednesday
that “Ronald McDonald could be
working out with the girls and they
wouldn't know it. All they've been
thinking about is the Eastems.”

Although Ronald McDonald
hasn't been around at any of the
Pantherette practices, sophomore
Regina Carson has. According to
DeMarino, Carson's presence,
along with that of senior Cyndee
Severyn and sophomore Alison
Hoburg, could determine Pitt’s
ﬁnal standing in the 15-team meet.

"Regina is a championship
performer,” DeMarino said. “The
bigger the meet, the more she can
get up for it. Last year, she had one
of her better performances in the
Easterns. This year, her two
strongest meets were against
Clarion and Penn State (both are
ranked among the top ﬁve teams in
the country).

“So, she is going to be important
to us," DeMarino continued, “and

Alison and Cyndee are going to be
important too. We have a young
squad (ﬁve freshmen will compete,
including nationally ranked Myra
Bachuchin and Bonnie Tressler). In
fact, Cyndee is the only girl who's
been in more than one of these
meets before, Regina's been in one
and Alison's been in one. Other
than these girls, none of the others
have ever competed in the
Easterns."

Carson is scheduled to compete in
the balance beam, and floor routine
competitions. Last year, the
sophomore from Belle Vernon
narrowly missed qualifying for the
Nationals in the all-around compe-
tition. One of her goals this
weekend is to qualify for this
season's championships, which will
be held in early April in Seattle.

‘ ‘I had one of my best meets as far
as scores were concerned in the
Eastems last year, ’ ’ Carson said. ‘ ‘I
ﬁnished in the top 10 in the vault
and in the top 12 on the beam, but
my scores just weren't high enough
to qualify. In the last round, one of
my events was held later in the
day. The later in the day you com-
pete, the lower your scores tend to
be." -

Needing 34 points in the
all-around competition to qualify,
Carson ended up with 33.6.

Carson said she had a problem
with motivation at the beginning of
the season. This, combined with a
staph infection that has bothered
her for most of the _winter created
some problems earlier this season.

(“At the beginning of the year,
when you haven't yet gotten into the
actual competition, things become a
drag,” Carson said. “I enjoy
meets. I enjoy competition. This is
my 15th year of gymnastics. When
you've been in it that long, your
body wants to retire.

“It was hard for me to get my
motivation up."

Carson said she thought she
finally broke out of her sophomore
slump during last month's Clarion
meet.

“I scored a 9.0 on the beam,”
Carson said. “Right then, I knew I
had gotten it back.”

With her problems behind her,
Carson looks forward to this year's
Eastern Championships.

“I’m really excited this year.
“Last year, I think I was kind of
excited from being nervous. This
year, I'm just excited. It's a great
feeling."

Helz’s om»... Spells Icers’ strong Point

we had to play some amateur
teams.”

The collegiate competition, par-
ticularly when there is a crowd of
s‘upporters’ for the other team,
excites Hetz.

“It gives me more of a desire to
beat teams because they are
backed up,” he said. “We like to
show that we're capable of doing it.
We played Miami of Ohio—they
had their own rink on campus and
had 2,000 people watching. We had
this desire to beat them (even
though we lost) because there was
more to prove.

“I respond personally to crowds.
I make comments to them just to
get them going. I just intimidate
them, ‘say something or give a
gesture.”

we won the Eastern Regionals, and
when I decided to transfer,
everyone there said that Pitt would
never beat UMass. Well, the time is
here, and this is my chance.”

The Pantherettes are faced with a
different type of situation this year
as they head in to regionals.

“The pressure is really on this
year more than last," said sopho-
more Alison Hoburg, “Last year
there wasn't much chance of us
going anywhere, but this year we
know that we can go to nationals."

The three-seeded Pantherettes
are blessed with several veterans of
national competition, a factor that
could be vital in handling the
pressure.

One of these veterans is Bonnie

Aggression wasn't always a big
part of Hetz's game, but now “I
have more guys backing me up,
and I don't have to worry.

“I don't really ﬁght a lot, but I
stay in there," he said. “I’m
Chippy. I've had more penalties
this year than I've ever had.”

Actually, it may be a bit of
digressing on Hetz's part—Pitt
goalie Larry Newell, a teammate
back in Shaler High, once quipped
that Hetz spent most of his senior
season in the penalty box.

One of the remarkable things

about the hockey club is that the.

ﬁghts used to break out between
the members when they played
against each other in Pittsburgh
area hockey games back in high
school.

Tressler, who competed last year in
national competitions in Chicago
and Tempe, Arizona. When asked
if her experience in this type of
competition will ease the pressure
of the weekend Tressler said that it
will deﬁnitely make a difference in
that she will know what to expect.
“I really feel good about this

weekend and I think everybody on’

the team does, too," Tressler said.

DeMarino stressed the impor-
tance of fan support to the success
of the Pantherettes in this
weekend's competition.

‘ ‘I can guarantee that this will be
the best regional competition
anywhere this year because of the
caliber of teams in the Eastern
region,” said DeMarino.

Early to Rise Healthy for Pantherettes Elston and Conley

By KAREN KADILAK
Pitt News Staff Writer

For most people, waking up
everyday at 6 a.m. can be difﬁcult.
But, for the members of the Pitt
swim teams, an early awakening is
mandatory, although not always
welcomed.

“It’s hard getting up that early,”
Pantherette swimmer Christy El-
ston said. “But we have a morning
practice. we have to attend.
Sometimes it can be bad. I know
I've missed a few practices because
of the time but, believe me, they've
been few." I . —

For those times Elston, a short
distance specialist, missed, team-
mate Jamie Conley probably
missed, too. Roommates for the
past two-and-a-half years, what one
does, the other usually does
too--especially if it means getting
extra sleep.

“It’s good that we're room-
mates," Elston said. “Not too
many people are up that early in the
morning. lknow all Jamie and I do
is turn on the stereo, get dressed
and leave. We don't say all that
much.”

The two juniors have more in
oommonthan being roommates and

teammates. Conley and Elston
began their swim careers together
as members of programs at a
country club and YMCA in
Meadville when they were 11.

I The only time they didn't swim
for the same clubs was in high
school. Conley, who has been a
consistent ﬁrst-place ﬁnisher for
the Pantherettes in the long
distance events the past three
years, competed for Meadville High
School. Elston swam the short
distance events for Mt. Lebanon
High School.

But although they attended A

different high schools, they kept in
touch.

“We had been friends for all that
time before Christy moved to Mt.
Lebanon," Conley said. “We saw
each other a lot at AAU meets in
Pittsburgh and Cleveland, so it
wasn't that we hadn't heard from
each other for a while. I was happy
we could room together.”

Elston and Conley ﬁnd rooming
together the “perfect situation.”
With Eastern and National champ-
ionships fast approaching, the
situation becomes even more
advantageous. .

“We encourage each other,”

Conley said. “We give each other
confidence. The pressure of
swimming does build at times.
Especially in the Easterns and
Nationals when everyone’s out to do
well.

“Sometimes you want to talk
things out. Having Christy around,
I feel I can talk about swimming
whenever I want. It helps out.”

“You have to get psyched as!iq_.!., *

team‘ and as individuals, especially“
in the Easterns,” Elston added.
“Knowing Jamie as well as I do, I
know she helps me get prepared for
the meet.”
