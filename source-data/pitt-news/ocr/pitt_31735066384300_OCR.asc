Welfare Benefits Ended
For Full-time Students

By RODNEY B. GRIFFITH

Robert Motor, a junior speech
major with a wife to support, is
losing General Assistance pay-
ments from the Pennsylvania
Department of Public _Welfare
(DPW), and may have a hard time
continuing at Pitt.

_ “I can't ﬁnd a job because I do
not have a degree. I am registered
with the Bureau of Employment
Security, and am honestly trying to
find a job,” said Motor, while at
the office of the Welfare Rights
Organization of Allegheny County
(WROAC). “If I find a decent job,
I'm willing to quit school and take a
job, and perhaps go to school
part-time."

Motor already receives a Basic
Education Opportunity Grant and a
loan from the school. but he needs
the GA payments for living

ggpenses.
«:7

Motor and other Pitt students
now receiving GA from the
Allegheny County Board of Assist-
ance (ACBA) are no longer eligible.
According to John Pfromm, press
secretary to the DPW, if a full-time
student receiving General Assist-
ance payments never has partici-
pated in the Federal Aid for
Dependent Children (FADC) pro-
gram, he is no longer eligible for
GA.

The new regulation results from a

(?clause nf an appropriations bill
 ‘ITO’ V H -7

passed by the Pennsylvania Legis-
lature late last year, which
prohibits full-time college or
university students from receiving

‘state assistance if they never have_
participated in a federally funded;

aid program.

Part-time students and students
who can prove their course of
studies is vocational training still
are eligible for GA according to Jim
Newton, Student Government Legal
Awareness Committee.

“This only affects students on
GA, stated Louis Lessem, welfare
specialist for Neighborhood Legal
Services (NLS). “Anybody who was
on AFDCU or AFDCF at any time
will still be eligible for GA.

The new regulation “is designed
to remove from the welfare rolls
those who could afford to attend
college through income sources
other than public welfare,”
Pfromm said.

“It is quite clear a number of
students have been doing that,
emancipating themselves and go-

ing on the welfare rolls,” said

Pfrom m .

According to Frank M. Dutko-
vich, Jr., director of Pitt’s Student
Aid Administration, his offices will
review the cases of affected
students. '

“We ask the student for written
proof of change of circumstances,
then try to re-evaluate his case,”

president and four for board

positions.

According to SGEC chairman Ron
Long, the turnout is to be about 16
percent, but he later indicated it
could increase due to the additional
day of voting.

If the turnout follows past
election trends, far less than the

estimated 11,000 eligible voters will
go to the polls. Last year the turnout
showed only 18.5 percent and that
represented the highest turnout in
three years.

‘The elections will cap more than a
week of campaigning. Candidates

Monday at a “Meet the Candidates
Day, but only a small number of
students attended.

The presidential candidates de-
bated twice yesterday on questions
posed by reporters from The Pitt
News, WPGH radio and the Black
Forum.

Several candidates will carry
endorsements into the elctions. I

ment of Baylson for president and

Poll Sees High Tu mot

By RICH HARRY

Pitt News Staff Writer
More than half of the students polled by The Pitt News recently said
they would cast votes in the Student Government Board elections this

week.

Of the 100 students polled, 60 said they deﬁnitely would vote while
40 indicated they would not or were undecided about going to the polls. ‘

The survey, conducted in the Cathedral, Student Union and Towers
Lobby, contrasts sharply with recent SGB voting trends, which include
a three-year turnout high of only 18.5 percent.

Most students who did not plan to vote were commuters who said
they were unfamiliar with the candidates and SGB.

“Icommute to Pitt,” said Cathy Nola, a freshman majoring in
Spanish. “I never know what’s going on. I don’t know who’s running. I
don't even know what student government is.”

Ed Shroeder, a freshman, also replied he would not vote. “I don’t
know too much about the election. I’m a commuter, and I’m lucky
enough to be here because of the weather.”

A small number of students admitted they were apathetic towards

the election.

“I have no interest. I’m apathetic. I don’t know the candidates and it
wouldn’t be fair to vote,” said a junior ﬁne arts major, who asked not to A

be identiﬁed by name.

Administrators say

Borrowing Alternative To Cuts

By TOM KUKUCKA

Pitt News Staff Writer

Continued borrowing, and not the —

closing or curtailment of University
services, would have been Pitt’s
Alternative to the budget crisis ‘had
the State Legislature not settled the
appropriations stalemate last Dec-
ember, according to Jack Freemen,
vice ‘chancellor for planning and
budget.

Freemen said cutting various
campus services would have been
“almost unthinkable,” He said
appropriations delays had occured
in the past, but Pitt had always
alleviated them through borrowing.

“We have had appropriations
delayed as long as March,”
Freemen said. “We always have
the capacity to borrow and never

Today in 5th Avenue: Langley Hall --

had a crisis in the sense of not
meeting payrolls, etc.”

Freemen said Pitt officials
remained conﬁdent throughout the
appropriations delays.

“It was a situation in which we
never seriously anticipated the state
government to not give us the
funds,” Freeman said.

Hibbard V. Kline, president of_
the University senatepexpressed a
similiar opinion.

“There was great concern and
speculation, but there was never
any point in time there would be
severe cutbacks. There was some
talk of cutting down on mainten-
ance, but that’s about all,” Kline
said.

The University Senate’s Budget
Policy Committee, headed by Dr.

One Year Later

Even the New York Times ran a story

Richard Pratt, considered various
aspects of the budget crisis. The
committee, composed of nine
faculty members and four students,
considered different areas of
curtailment,
emergency measure. Committee
members would not disclose the
priorities involved in closing down
various facets of the University.

Committee member Dr. Norman
Mulgrave said he believes the
University’s credit would have kept
services running.

“The University had a line of
credit that would have enabled it to
keep borrowing,” Mulgrave said.
“Pitt would have continued to
operate this winterto prevent any
loss of tuition.”

CAS Council

~ By LEONARD ROMBERG

-‘ill News Staff Writer

CAS Council Monday discussed’
the provosts document, which
covers academic planning from
1980-1990, and lists proposals for
possible restructuring of under-
graduate programs, largely in CAS
and in the School of General
Studies.

CAS Dean Robert Marshall said,
“the document was distributed

‘Jroadlyi‘through’GL‘t"{l"e University; '

and (the provost) asked people to
respond.” ‘

The meeting centered on two
proposed alternative models for
Pitt’s undergraduate programs.
One proposal would retain CAS as
a smaller school, and allow SGS to
hold classes in the daytime to serve
students both part-time and full-
time.

Welfare cut

The other proposal would allow

’ several CAS departments to create

their own programs for students,
who would transfer after one or two
years of basic courses. The option

to enter an undergraduate profes-
sional program such as business or
public affairs also would exist

, under the proposal.

CAS members also discussed the
possibility of combining CAS and

Marshall said CAS is basically a
full-time day program for students
between’ 18 and 22 years old, while
SGS ,is a non-degree part-time
night program aimed at older
students. A problem of the current
structure is unintentional overlap-
ping and unavailability of certain
programs to students, some council
members said.

1‘ Plan Discussed

They also debated whether Pitt
offers enough undergraduate
career-orientated programs.

Another concern, voiced by
economics professor Herbert Ches-
ler, is that the University

“shouldn’t restructure the school
to the aspirations of 17-year-old
students who come in with
unrealistic expectations.”

Marshall said, “Our estimate is
out of a freshman class of 1,800,
1,100 are in that class (aspiring for
professional schools such as
medical or law).

Marshall said restructuring CAS
and possibly including an under-
graduate business program was
prompted in part by the fear of
decreasing enrollment in future
years. '

Students Lose State Benefits

(L 0llll!liiL‘tl in-m l’;ii:r I)

said Dutkovich. “Even if welfare
takes this drastic step, students
would still be eligible for a
guaranteed loan. I doubt if many
students will be affected this term
by the situation.” A

Students losing their state
assistance are receiving mail-
delivered forms for notiﬁcationof
their GA cancellation.

Appeals must be ﬁled within 10
days, or students risk losing
payments they would receive
during the 30-day appeal period.

According to Lessem, students
possibly could owe the state money
they received during the appeal

period should they ultimatelylose

the appeal. He added, however,
the state is unlikely to collect the
money.

A regulation requiring repay-
ment is on the books, but I never
have seen it enforced, and, in my
opinion, it is unconstitutional,”
Lessem said. “In cases of a good
faith appeal, I never have seen an
attempt to collect.”

Poll SeesHigh Turnout

((onImucd from l’;it1t_‘ 1)

Others who said they wouldn’t vote also criticized the board for
being ineffective. “Student Government appears to be only something
to put down on a resume,” commented one student, who refused to be

named.

Asked what they condidered to be the major issue in the election

students gave answers ranging from the Undergraduate Academic
Review (UAR) to the accesibility of the board to students.

“The UAR is a common interest to all students, no matter what their
constituency," said Phil Cillo, a junior and chairman of the Resident
Student Association. “Professors should be evaluated by the students;
we’re the ones who see them work.”

Some students said the board should restructure itself, and become

more open to students.

“The board "should be broadened.to

include 30 members,

representing different student groups,” said Bob McGaha, a freshman
‘majoring in political science and German.

“The president should have more power,” said a junior engineering

major, who asked not to be identiﬁed. “Now there’s no incentive for

him to be leader. » 2

“There aren’t any major issues other than making students aware A

there is a student government.”

A majority of thestudents said they stillwere undecided about who -

 vote for, and several persons indicated that none of the three 

. residential candidates has .impressed3themf.< 

“I’m looking for someone who gets thejob done,” said Frank Byers, '9

a senior in electrical engineering. ‘

"No one strikes me as a strong *

leader. None seems to have charisma.”

Regualtions originally published
by the DPW were believed to be
overly restrictive and more narrow
than the state law provided,
according to Lessem. The amended
regulations have been republished,
and were released Saturday.

Because of the rewriting of the
regulation, those who already have
received termination notices will be
sent new ones. Students who
receive new notiﬁcations will have
to appeal that notiﬁcation, Lessem
said. ’

Currently, Neighborhood Legal
Services is assisting appealates
waiting for the outcome of a class
action suit ﬁled by Community
Legal Services in Philadelphia,
which challenges the new regula-
tion denying full-time students GA.

“Right now, we are taking
appeals,” said Lessem. “In terms
of going into court for a class, I am
not ina position to tell anything
now. If that (Philadelphia) case
fails, we have to determine what
other action is open to us.”

Freemen said last year's budget
crisis was not caused by the
legislators refusal to help state-re-

.lated schools, but by disagreement

over a speciﬁc budget.

“This was never an issue of
higher education not getting
money,” Freemen said. “It was an
inability of the legislators to get
together and solve a legislative
problem‘. We were victims of
revenue.” .

Although the appropriations
were passed before the start of
winter term, the money allotted to
Pitt was not as much as Freemen
and other Pitt officials had
requested.

‘ ‘We expected an increase of $1.2 I

million dollars,” said Freemen,
“but the money‘ appropriated was
somewhat less than expected.”

The level of funding was the same
amount the University received last
year. Chancellor Wesley Posvar
indicated earlier this term that
tuition would be raised for the
1978-1979 school year to compen-
sate for the lack of increased
funding.

Welfare and Students

Individual cases are -more important than generalizations in this

',"?'.’3"
an 5-0,

but the impending cutoff of Department of Public-Weitare.

General Assistance funds to some students here could very well be
one step forward and two steps backward. '

No one can reasonably deny that the welfare system is a mess. It
is fraud-ridden, excessively expensive and an administrative jungle.
People who don’t need public assistance get it, and people who
need it don’t get the kind that would help them to avoid needing it

_ in the future.

Students are part of the problem. While it could be true that
most students already on public assistance are legitimate recipients
(as is true of recipients in general), there are also a few who use the
system more as a convenience than a necessity. The fact is, it’s a

rare student who really needs welfare.

In generations past, men

and women have maintained rigorous work schedules and kept up
with their studies at the same time. There is no reason wny most
students today can’t do the same thing. It might not even be a bad

experience.

On the other hand., cutting off benefits to students in order to
check rising welfare costs is rather like trying to trim the fat from

an elephant with a pair of nail clippers.

The enormity of the

welfare budget, and the tax revenues needed to support it, are
problems that call for somewhat more comprehensive solutions.
We can’t help but suspect that students have been singled_out as a
politically attractive scapegoat in this instance.

More important, care must be taken to ensure that students who
genuinelyneed public assistance aren’t ripped from the rolls along

with those who don’t.

Whereas most students should be able to

support themselves through school, a few are not——single parents

with young children in some cases, for instance.

in these cases,

financial aid may be the only thing between a life of poverty for the
recipient and a chance for upward mobility.

It ma

be that assistance to persons in this category should be

earmarked for educational costs (and given in adequate amounts)

seem a much more rational approach to the problem. But whatever ‘

turns ‘out to be the best method, welfare administrators must be
careful to notice just who needs what when they start cutting the

budget

Letters To The Editor

Pitt’s Bureaucratic Runaround

Once again, the University’s
massive bureaucracy of red tape has
pulled a real swifty on the innocent
student. While I was waiting in line
at the cafeteria one day late last
term, Iwas informed by the checker
that my meal card had been
invalidated. I was sent upstairs to
the Housing Office where a

_secretary handed me a notice

informing me that my bill had not

_ been paid in full. Since I had paid

my bill two weeks before I was
deﬁnitely confused and slowly
becoming enraged. She told me to
go to G-33 in the Cathedral to have
things straightened out. When I
asked what the reasoning behind
this action was, I received a
brusque, inaudible answer.
Assuming this lady had spent too
many hours in a bar the night
before, I left her, in search of a
better source of information.
Arriving at G-33 I found the

trademark of this institution of
higher learning, a very long line. At
the end of my 45 minute wait I not
only discovered that almost every-
one else in the line was there for the
same reason as I, but that I also
needed proof of payment of my bill
before I could have my meal card
validated. As I stormed back to my
room I thought of ﬁfty different
ways one could short-circuit a
computer.

After retrieving the proper
materials, I proceeded back to G-33
to wait in a second long line. When I
ﬁnally reached the front of the line
the secretary informed me that
there had been a mistake and that

. my bill was paid in full. I thanked

her graciously for her eye-opening
information and stalked back to my
room. All ideas of lunch were lost
since the cafeteria had been closed
for almost an hour.

I understand that people (and
computers) make mistakes but I
would like to know why things were
handled the way they were. First of
all, this all occured during ﬁnals
week and I had much to dp and not
too much time to do it. Waiting two
hours in line does not accomplish a
whole lot of physics. Secondly, did
the housing ofﬁce have to be so
drastic in cancelling my meal plan
just to get me over to the Cathedral?

Believe it or not, students at this
university can read, so why not ‘send
a letter explaining the situation and

rm//’_‘

requesting that they go to G-33 with

some proof that they paid their bills.

There must be a less complicated
and less time consuming way of
handling mistakes in billing other
than the way I went through that
day.

Marshall's Resignation Leaves A Gap

By R. DAVID TIVE

The resignation of Robert Mar-
shall as dean of the College of Arts
and Sciences cannot come as a
surprise to anyone who has been
following his recent statements on
controversial issues, but must come
as a disappointment to those
concerned with the direction of
Pitt’s present and future develop-
ment.

Marshall, as dean, is a study in
contrasts. He is an idealist, but his
idealism is tempered with a good
dose of reality. The idealism is
demonstrated by his desire to make

the University truly student-center-
ed. This in an era of
cost-effectiveness, and in an
institution where faculty research,
not student learning, is king. His
realism is demonstrated by his
recognition that some of Pitt’s
students fall well below the national
average academically, and that Pitt
is doing nothing to meet their
needs.

Such statements and positions
are not popular in the higher
echelons of the Pitt administration.
As Marshall himself said, “I have
become controversial.. .I don’t think

there is any other representation in
the administration for this point of
view.”

That is the true tragedy of his
resignation. It is necessary to have
at least one person willing to speak
out as a minority voice, one person
willing to describe things the way
they are, while still striving to put
them the way they _should be. It is
certainly not a feather in Pitt’s cap
that such a person was frustrated to
the point where he felt there was no
longer a place for him in the
University’s upper councils.

' One question foremost in many
minds now is, what will happen to
the initiatives and issues raised by
Marshall? Will the University
realize that in addition to providing
much needed opportunities for the
academically superior student, such
as the new Honors Program, that
attention must be paid to those at
the opposite end of the academic
spectrum? Will the reward system
for faculty be changed so that the
committment to promotion for
quality teaching, as well as for
research, is a fully realized
commit-tment, instead of just a
rhetorical one?

Marshall, in comments accomp-
anying his resignation, seems to be
leading us to believe otherwise.
While saying that he hoped his
replacement would support his
stances on many issues, he also said

 

he fears, “There will be a strong
desire to choose as my replacement
someone who will be more in step. ’ ’

I can join Dean Marshall in
hoping that his fears are unfound-
ed. However, one decision that has
already been revealed is a bad sign.
Whoever the new CAS Dean is, he
or she will not report directly to the
provost, as has been the case with
Marshall. All proposals and
recommendations coming from the
CAS office will now have to be
funneled through Jerome Rosen-
berg, dean of the Faculty of Arts
and Sciences. While in no way pre-
judging Rosenberg’s performance
in that role, ’ I have to express
dismay at this apparent downgrad-
ing of the academic office most
directly responsible for the largest
number of undergraduates on this
campus, and its removal to one step
further away from the seats of
power. '

The timing of Marshall's resigna-
tion provides Pitt with the
opportunity to give some uniﬁed
planning and direction to its

handling of undergraduates.

Coming, as it does, at the same time
that a replacement is being sought
for Dean of Admissions Kenneth
Wenger, the CAS vacancy now
gives the University the chance to
take the two ofﬁces most directly
effecting the quality of undergrad-
uateeducation at Pitt, redeﬁne their

. ...._.g

 

responsibilities and authorities, ﬁll
them with qualiﬁed, student-orient-
ed individuals and turn them into

‘places where the student interes?

comes first, and student service is a
way of life.

Bob Marshall resigned because
he didn’t see those things
happening, and was tired of playing
a “negative role” by trying to make
them happen. Serious thought
should be given to the implications

of that statement for a student-

oriented administrator in a univer-
sity to be considered a negativist is a
harst indictment. Care should be
taken to change that situation now.
not after we lose more Bob
Marshalls.

EARN OVER $650 A MONTH

6   RIGHT THROUGH YOUR

SENIOR YEAR.  

If you’re a junior or a senior majoring in math, physics or
engineering, the Navy has a program you should know about.
It’s called the Nuclear Propulsion Officer Candidate-

Collegiate Program (NUPOC-C for short) and if you qualify,
you can earn as much as $650 a month right through your
senior year. Then after 16 weeks of Officer Candidate School,
you’ll receive an additional year of advanced technical
education. This would cost you thousands in a civilian school,
but in the Navy, we pay you. And at the end of the year of
training, you’ll receive a $3,000 cash bonus.

It isn’t easy. There are fewer than 400 openings and only
one of every six applicants will be selected. But if you make
it, you’ll have qualified for an elite engineering training
program. With unequaled hands-on responsibility, a $24,000
salary in four years, and gi1t—edged qualifications for jobs
in private industry should you decide to leave the Navy
later. (But we don’t think you’ll want to.)  

Ask your placement officer to set up an interview with a
Navy representative when he visits the campus on.J an. 20.,
or contact your Navy representative at 412-644-5898 (collect),
If you prefer, send your resume to the Navy Nuclear Officer
Program, Code 312-B468, 4015 Wilson Blvd., Arlington,

Va. 22203, and a Navy representative will contact you directly.
The NUPOC-Collegiate Program. It can do more than help
you finish college: it can lead to an exciting career opportunity.

“BLIJSE El}lE|]lll}lTEFiS”- Fl HU‘.’l [IF THE BEST HJDID

By M. PATRICK MONAHAN
Pitt News Staff Writer
“Close Encounters of a Third
Kind”

‘ ‘Directed by Steven Spielberg

If 1977 was the year of “Star
Wars,” the action-packed science
ﬁction-fantasy ﬂick that came out of
nowhere to become the highest-
grossing ﬁlm of all time, in 1978
“Close Encounters of the Third
Kind” may follow suit. -

The public seemingly has awak-
ened to new slickly-done science
ﬁction movies. Both “Star Wars”
and “Close Encounters of the Third
Kind” have helped to arouse this
sleeping interest.

“Close Encounters” opened in
mid-December after the greatest
hype of -any ﬁlm this year. After
seeing it, it is apparent many of its
promises come true.

While “Star Wars” was primar-
ily a fantasy film with the ancient
human theme of good vs. evil in
another galaxy a long time ago,
“Close Encounters of the Third
Kind’ ’ is straight out of the present,
and portrays contact with UFO’s as
positive and probable.

It is a magniﬁcently constructed
ﬁlm about man’s ﬁrst actual contact
with alien beings from another
world.

To avoid confusion over the title,
a brief explanation of some ofﬁcial
terms for unidentiﬁed ﬂying objects
—a close encounter of the ﬁrst kind
is a sighting of a UFO; a close
encounter of the second kind is
physical evidence of a UFO; a close
encounter of the third kind is actual
contact.

If you have seen 1950’s grade-B
movies such as “The Thing” and
“Mars Needs Women,” you may

not be optimistic about “Close
Encounters” ability to make you
watch the stars and sky on a clear
summer night, looking for green
men.

However, “Close Encounters is
the most enthralling ﬁlm on the
UFO topic to date. Credit must go to
the great overall cast performance,
the stunning special effects, moving
score and, of course, the writer and
director, Steven Spielberg.

Spielberg has done a masterful
job in direction and plot. The movie

‘is well-paced, building to the

“inevitable conclusion” that we are
not alone.

Spielberg has said it is his dream
to have a close encounter of the
third kind. If it occurred as he
envisioned it in the movie, it would
be a breathtaking experience.

The movie's central character is
an Indiana telephone lineman

worker (Richard Dreyfuss) who has
encounters of the ﬁrst two kinds
while on job late one night.

Dreyfuss is faced with two
choices: to ﬁnd out more about the
unique experience or to satisfy his
wife’s plea to stay at home and be a
regular father and husband.

It’s easy to identify with
Dreyfuss. He’s a blue-collar worker
with four rambunctious kids, who
gets his kicks by playing with model
trains.

Dreyfuss is ﬁred from his job
when he chooses to go UFO
hunting. His wife (Terri Garr) and
family think heiis losing his mind.
In one of the ﬁlm’s most moving
moments Dreyfuss breaks down at
the dinner table while trying to
explain this obsession.

In ‘a similar predicament is a
fragile young widow (Melinda
Dillian) who has encounters of the

ﬁrst two kind. Later, her four-year-
old son (Cary Guffy) is scooped up
by a UFO that surrounds her home.

Guffy, in afew wordless scenes in
which he delightedly watches the
UFO’s, nearly steals the ﬁlm.

Dreyfuss and Dillion inevitably
meet, and pursue the UFO’s for
different reasons. Dreyfuss,
because it is the most overwhelming
event of his humdrum life; Dillion,
because her child has been taken
away from her by alien forces.

“Close Encounters of the Third
Kind” makes an excellent point
about UFO believers and non-
believers.

In the movie, as in real life, there
are volatile proponents on both
sides. Dillion is seen as a nut when
she goes ‘on national television,
trying to explain that her son has
been abducted; Dreyfuss is a fool in

“Equus” A Gripping Dramatic Film

By LEONARD ROMBERG
Pitt News Staff Writer

“Equus,” the Tony award-
winning drama about a 17-year-old
boy who blinds six horses with a
metal spike, has been successfully
transformed from the stage to the
screen.

In this suspenseful and at one
point, gory movie, director Sidney
Lumet has kept the original Peter
Shaffer book intact, releasing this
British psychodrama at a pace that
absorbs an almost helpless aud-
ience into the story.

Richard Burton plays Dr. Martin
Dysart, a psychiatrist who reluc-
tantly accepts the case of Alan
Strang, the boy who has committed
the hideous crime. Burton opens

the film by explaining why he took
the case and, in a well-accomplish-
ed series of ﬂashbacks, he tells how
he “carved into” Alan’s mind to
ﬁnd all the whys of the mysterious
case.

And a mysterious case is exactly
what it is. The ﬁrst time Dysart
meets with the boy, played
passionately well by Peter Firth, the
only words he can pull out of the
patient is a series of TV commercial
jingles. ,

However, by using his skills, he
slowly breaks into Alan’s mind and
gets him to tell and relive his
remarkable childhood and his
previous experiences with horses.
It is in these ﬂashback scenes that
the ﬁlm succeeds most.

Symphony

By LYNNE_,L. MEYERS
Pitt News Staff Writer

The Pittsburgh Symphony got
1978 to a ﬂying start last night with
their ﬁrst concert of the new year.
It seemed conductor Donald
Johanos pushed all the right
buttons and received inspired
responses from his men. The
well-planned program included two
(pieces written in 188(}—Brahms’
Academic Festival Overture and
Dvorak’s Sixth Symphony—with
the modern and challenging Berg
Violin Concerto sandwiched be-
tween. The soloist was Rafael
Drurian, former concertmaster of
the Cleveland Orchestra, and the
entire concert was dedicated to the
memory_ of ,_t_h_e _lat.e Musicians
Union head. Hal Davis.

F alco Ballet Company Inspired Onstage

By SALLY RAPPEPORT
and PAT LAWS

What made the Louis F3100
Dance Company one of the most
exciting performing groups to come
to Pittsburgh? Was it the ‘daring
way in which the dancers ﬂung their
bodies into the movements? Was it
the interesting balletic choreogra-
phy? Or the ;absolute ease and
abandonment that the dancers
displayed onstage? Whatever
quality captivated the individual,
the Louis Falco Dance Company
enthralled audiences at the Stephen
Foster Memorial Theater last
Friday and Saturday nights.

One should not be misled by the
title “Academic Festival Over-
ture”; the work was meant as a
spoof, not an homage, to the
pompous university alma mater
songs Brahms had to put up with at
Mainz University. To. American
ears, one of the university songs
sounds quite like “The Farmer in
the Dell,” which makes the piece
that much more entertaining. After
initial horn balance problems and
the usual warming-up time, the
orchestra coalesced into a strong
unit, especially the strong, lush
strings and climaxed the piece
brilliantly.

The most gripping performance
of the evening was the 1935 Berg
Violin Concerto, a.piece neither
liked nor understood by the general

The highlight of the evening was
the. premier performance of “Sand
and Foam,” choreographed by
associate director Juan Antonio.
Ranko Yokoyama and William
Gornel danced this pas de deux set
to electronic music by Jen-Michele
Jarre. As the rhythm of the music
pulsed, the dancers moved, creat-
ing beautiful shapes and lines. The
pair appeared so comfortable, one
would”ii'e"ver have known it wa’§'tFe‘
ﬁrst time this piece had been
performed. The movement was as
natural as if the dancers were just
walking down the street, a tribute to
the choreography as well as the
dancing.

.“Two Penny Portrait,” choreo-

Alan’s attraction to horses began
when he was six years old, when he
encountered a man riding a horse on
the beach. From this encounter,
when he got to ride the animal, the
horse became a symbol planted in
his mind, one of attraction and
respect.

Alan was torn between his
mother’s deep religious beliefs--
each night, she told him bible
stories and stories that gloriﬁed
horses--and his mysterious regard
for the powerful animal. This
conﬂict was reinforced in Alan’s
dreams by a picture of a horse that
hung on the wall across from his
bed. Ironically, the picturehad
replaced a religious picture.

Eventually, the audience sees
that Equus (the Latin term for
horse) is Alan’s symbolic god.
Through Dysart’s techniques, de-
signed to make Alan talk, it is
discovered why Alan blinded six
horses’ in a stable he worked at on
weekends.

But the plot goes much further -

than that. Dysart is a man who has a
cold marriage, always having
maintained distance from his wife.

To him, Alan is a symbol of his own
frustration. He interprets the boy’s
penetrating stare as saying, “at
least I’ve galloped, when did you?”

Fortunately, with the help of his
magistrate friend Hester Saloman,

Dysart maintains his professional
perspective, and is able to help his
patient.

The ﬁlm rarely deviates from the

original play script, yet it lends/}’l

itself to the screen with few
difﬁculties. While the play depends
on symbolism, King made the
playgoer solve much of the mystery,
Lumet has made the movie more
literal, giving the audience facts in
an obvious manner.

The ﬂashback scenes do not
lessen the drama’s impact but
further it, making the ﬁlm stronger
and more moving. Only in the ﬁnal
scene is the play stronger in
bringing forth the meaning of

public. This is a classic example of
musicologists placing a stereotyped
label on a work, thus hindering the
layman’s appreciation of it. The
label is “12-tone” music. This
means the 12 notes in an octave are
played consecutively, without repe-
tition. Generally, composers using
this system write chaotic music that
has little to do with keys, singable
melodies or emotional content.
Berg is a notable exception to this,
but,’ because of the general
misconception about 12-tone
music, he has not been judged on
his own merits.

Donald Johanos last night
proved he always has had a special
afﬁnity with the Berg Violin
Concerto. The dynamic range, from
whisper-soft to viciously loud, was

graphed by Louis Falco, provided a
contrast to the program’s other
pieces. Another pas de deux, this
time between Lisa Nalven and Louis
Falco, “Two Penny Portrait”
showed the dancers’ reactions to
their environment, ‘which seemed in
a state of discord. The sound,
arranged by Burt Alcantara, ranged
from trafﬁc sounds to breaking
glass to carnival tunes. The setting
was a partially lit stage strewn with
garbage cans, newspapers and a
teddy bear. The dancers displayed
ﬂuctuating feelings of love, hate,

security and insecurity.

Another piece about relation-
ships, “Hero,” also was choreo-

extreme in the best sense of the
word. The raw power and
emotional tension in the horns and
trombones was particularly deva-
stating, and the brasses cried and
vibrated like Russian brass, just as
they sometimes do under Andre
Previn’s direction, and the cli-
maxes were convincing.

Rafael Drurian took a back seat
in the performance, and let
Johan0s’s enthusiasm carry him.
Drurian’s playing in the ﬁrst
movement was cold, calculated and
correct, but the second movement
was somewhat better. However,
Drurian’s role in the performance
seemed secondary and unimpor-
tant, and the orchestra stole the
show.

The second half of the program

graphed by Louis Falco. The
hypnotic, chanting, music was
composed and performed by Badal
Roy. Radha Shottam and Frank
Tusa. The piece comprised a series
of pas de deux, in which Falco
interchanged the couples, some-
times having a male partner a male
or a female partner a female.
However, the choreography was
monotonous because there were no
dynamic changes, and the move-
ments were repetitious. The strong
point of the piece was the ending,
where everyone danced in unison.
The program concluded with an
enjoyable version of “Tiger Rag,”
danced by the whole company,
minus Louis Falco. It opened very

contained one work, the Dvorak
Symphony No. 6. The contrast
between this quaint, delightfully
light work and the searing emotion
of the Berg Violin Concerto was
much too sudden. The Dvorak,
although pretty and melodious,
seems awkward in its blending of
Czech-sounding melodies with
German-style music a la Schubert,
Brahms and Beethoven. Johanos

did not try to change or to rediry"  _
the piece, but played the score 

smoothly, with no undue stress on
any section or undue challenges for
the lay listener.

The playing was ﬁrst rate, but
the piece is boring, no matter what
the conductor and orchestra do to
it.

theatrically, with trainer, whip, and
sculptured tiger head costumes
designed by Marisol. One
humorous section of the dance was a
duet between a pair of pants and a
jacket, a clever use of costumes as
props. The ﬁnale of “Tiger Rag”
included 18 Point Park College
students, dressed like the “pants”
character. They wore trousers that
covered the entire body and had
about an 80-inch waisline. The

jiggling pants cluttered the stage so /

that the company dancers were"
obstructed from view.

The Louis Falco dancers com-
municated the love of their art to the
Stephen Foster audience, inspiring
the same love from its members.

discouraged from continuing his
quest by federal authorities.

The action builds until the
grandly-staged conclusion, an ac-
tual encounter with the alien beings
in a federally-sanctioned communi-
cation attempt.

Douglas Trumbull’s special ef-
fects during the first two-thirds of
the ﬁlm, dealing with encounters of
the ﬁrst two kinds, are well-
photographed and realistic.

UFO’s fly by through the night air
in the quiet Indiana countryside as
bumpkinish folk, as well as
Dreyfuss and Dillion, watch them
from the mountains.

However, it is the ﬁnal encounter
that displays one of the most
astounding special effects ever
designed.

During the attempt to contact the
alien forces from federa1ly- guarded
mountain complex, their mother
ship, which seems to be the size of
an entire city, appears.

It hovers over the mountain, then

Spielberg gives the contact
between two different worlds a
mood of peace and wonder.

This innocence is best portrayed
by a compassionate French UFO

of UFO’s is played by French

director Francois Truffaut.

The film’s other strength is its

emotional struggle with his patient

Cagers to Entertain Colonials

By BOB LABRIOIA

Pitt News Staff Writei

The Pitt Panthers transform from
the hunter to the hunted when the
7-5 cagers, fresh from a stunning
upset of Syracuse, face lowly Robert
Morris Wednesday night at the
Field House.

Robert Morris (no relation to that
infamous thorn in the Panthers’
paw, Morris Harvey) brings a 2-10
record into tcr.i°ht’s contest 
the knowledge they have nothing to
lose and everything to gain playing
a team like Pitt.

The Colonials are a recent
addition to the ranks of Division I
basketball (1976-77 was their first
year), with victories over Lehigh
and Houston Baptist, while losing to
nationally-ranked Louisville, 104-
68.

‘ ‘We’re not winning on a Division
I level as yet, we're just
competing,” said Athletic Director
Ken Mease. “We are a young ball
club, and since we've been

competitive in most of our games,

 

the future may be brighter for our
program.”

i As many as four freshman will be
on the court together for coach
Tom Weirich, as 6-7 senior Charlie
Gaines, leading the Colonials in
scoring with a 19.8 points per game
average, has been benched in favor
of youthful aggressiveness.
Freshmen Brandon Jackson, Mike
Fitzgerald, Anthony Suber ‘and’
Steve Johnston will be the major
participants for Robert 5.'-.-:»:r?‘.iS,-
while a ﬁfth freshman, Larry
Downing, had been in the starting
lineup until an injury shortened his
season.

The tallest player on the Colonial
squad is Gaines, but the tallest
player in the starting lineup stands
6-6. For one of the few times this
season, Sam Clancy will be able to
look his opening tipoff opponent
directly in the eyes.

It will be interesting to see who
will start for the Panthers, as
Wayne Williams added a new
dimension Saturday night by
handling the point guard position

  

the first time he played there. That
makes Williams one of ﬁve players
on ‘the team who has seen action at
the position.

Beside having their collective
ears boxed since joining the
Division I clan, (9-29 over the last
year and one-half) Robert Morris is
also ﬁnding it diﬂicult to establish
game contracts with other universit-
ies.

“It’s tough for, us to get games
unless -there is a personal relation-
ship with the coac ,” ‘Mease
explained. “Teams nowadays are
league oriented, and it’s tough on
an independent to break some of the
barriers.

“Right now, we're looking to
form our own league, and by the end
of the season something deﬁnite
shouldcome about. We'd like to get
into an established league, but I
don't feel that we’d be wanted in
any that exist now.”

Panther Notes...This is the ﬁnal
game of a four-game homestand,
followed by three road games
before the Panthers return to the
Field House Feb. 2...Rumor has it
that the Colonials have been
practicing a stall lately...Larry
Harris needs to average just over 20
points per game the rest of the
season to become Pitt's all time
leading scorer...Duquesne will
entertain West Virginia Thursday
and George Washington will play
host to Rutgers tonight.

Stepano vich Returns A fter Two Bouts With Surgery

By KAREN KADILAK
Pitt News Staff Writer
The old college try is still around,
and one needn't look any farther
than the Pitt wrestling team to see

The Panther grapplers downed

Bucknell, 23-17, with heavyweight
Mark Stepanovich recording his
first win of the season after
recuperating from stomach and
knee surgery. In the Temple match
that followed, Stepanovich’s team-
mates won enough of the early
matches so that he didn’t have to
wrestle. Pitt forfeited the ‘heavy-
weight division hanging on to win,
21-20.

Enter team spirit and 190 pound
Mike Palko. Palko needed to
avoid a superior decision or pin if
Stepanovich, still not 100 percent
well, was to sit out.

“The guys didn’t want me to

5 ;"T'?~.tle in that match,” Stepano-

A!

vich said. “They thought the extra
rest would do my knee some good.
They wanted to save me as much as

possible and have me wrestle only
if necessary. The 190-pound match
was the turning point. If Mike got
pinned or lost by a superior
decision, I would have had to
wrestle in that last match.

“If he didn’t get pinned or lose

by that much of a point
difference,” the 6-3, 252-pound
senior from North Royallton, Ohio
continued, “we would be guaran-
teed of winning the match.

“It was really something,”
Stepanovich said. “The whole team

was pulling for Palko. They were all
ﬁred up.”

His teammates’ inspiration must
have done Palko some good.
Although Palko was defeated 12-3,
he didn’t lose by a ‘superior
decision or pin, making it neces-

sary for Stepanovich to wrestle.

As it was, Stepanovich, who had
missed practice the week before
Saturday’s match to lifting weights
to build up his injured knee,
received the extra rest he’ll need
going into Saturday’s meet be-
tween Pitt and national power
Lehigh at the Field House.

“He hasn't had that many
opportunities to wrestle for some
time now,” Pitt coach Dave Adams
said. “He did a good job for us
Saturday, that's for sure. It was
also good to see the attitude our
team had during Palko’s match.
The guys were really ﬁred up.”

Adams, who now sees his team’s
regular 190-pounder, Bill Bailey,
out indeﬁnitely with a knee injury,
hopes to see the same kind of
attitude prevelant among his
grapplers this week as they begin
preparation for Lehigh.

“It’s going to take a super
effort, but I think our guys can
meet the challenge,” Adams said.

Panther lcers Defeat Duquesne--In Spite of Ice

That was one strange game at the
Civic Arena last night. Certainly
not your typical Pitt-Duquesne
hockey contest.

First off, it might be ﬁtting to
announce the score——Pitt won, 6-1.
But let’s not stop there. The game
never materialized into the tradi-
tional Panthers-Dukes duke-out
that has become a custom over the
years. There were hard hitting and
chippy play, but no major ﬁghts to
speak of.

This can be attributed to a
pre-game proposition thrown out to
the two clubs by the ofﬁcials. The
weather snowed in one of the two
ofﬁcials, so only one was available.
In an effort to maintain order, he
asked that when any altercation
erupted a member from each team

Qywould step in and grab his own

1‘ .eammate.

Not only did the snow prevent a
full officiating squad, Mother
Nature kept Pitt coach Len
Barcalow out in the cold, too.

Barcalow must not have had his
snow tires working to perfection,
which left Panther Bill Gedeon to
man the fort.

Perhaps the biggest surprise of
the night, though, came in the form
of the people who did show up——52l

to be exact, which is the largest
home audience Pitt has encounter-
ed.

Five hundred and 21 people!
Barcalow missed something he’s
been waiting on for years—a
respectably sized crowd to play
before at home. One of the Pitt
coach’s favorite claims in the past
always has concerned his team’s
following. ‘

“Yeah, we played before ‘a
standing room only crowd,” he’d
say. “There were a few people
standing around here and there.”

Of the 521 sitting around at the
Arena last night, an estimated 519
were Duquesne rooters, but even
this crowd failed to bring home a
win for the Dukes. They kept it

close for a while, but that's all they
could manage.

After 14 scoreless minutes at the
start of the game, Pitt scored with
58 seconds left before the ﬁrst
intermission. Pitt defenseman Rick
Stein dumped the puck into the
Duquesne end, where Tom Sherwin
picked it up behind the red goal line.
His shot bounced off goalie Eric
Sutliff’s stick, and trickled in the net
for Sherwin’s ﬁrst of three straight
goals and a 1-0 Pitt lead.

A carryover Duquesne penalty
into the second period set up
Sherwin’s second tally with half a
minute lapsed in the second period.
Curt Hetz and Tim Duffy provided
the assists, handing the puck to
Sherwin, who beat Sutliff on his
upper glove-hand side with a rising
shot from the point.

‘A Dukes goal, which would have
made it 2-1, was disallowed by the
one working official, who had
already stopped play because of
a double penalty. Hetz and Dukes

two-goal lead.

Sherwin quickly made it a
three-goal lead after stealing the
puck from a Duquesnedefender.

Sherwin scooted down the right side
and tallied an unassisted goal to
complete his hat trick.

Spartans Bop Tankers

By KATHY SABA

The Pantherette swim team was
defeated by Michigan State, 68-63,
last Saturday at Michigan.

“We came off two weeks of
training and a long bus ride into
that meet,” said coach Kate
Mathison. “We also were lacking
in ' concentration at times. ’ ’

Mathison was pleased with the
performances of Kathy Stetler and
Suzanne Pulley. Stetler placed ﬁrst
in the 100 meter free style (55:05),
‘200 meter free style (l:57.83), and
the 500 meter free style (5:19.25).

Pulley won the 200 meter interme-
diate medley (2:16.04) and the 100
meter backstroke (1103.82). Pulley
was also a member of the winning
400 meter medley relay team
(4:16.5), along with Sue Guyer,_
Jamie Conley and Patti Davis.

The 400 meter free style relay
team of Pulley, Davis, Christy
Elston and Stetler took ﬁrst with a
time of 3:40.13.

Quality sprint work, starts and
turns are the areas in which
Mathison sees need for team
improvement.

The Pantherette swim team will
travel to Penn State Saturday.

Gymnasts Bow to Third-Ranked Lions; Top WVU

By SUE McFARLAND
Pitt News Staff Writer

In two days of tiring competition,
the Pitt gymnastic teams dropped a
meet to third-ranked Penn State
Friday before notching a victory
over West Virginia at the WVU
Coliseum in Morgantown.

In Friday’s meet, before a

' capacity crowd at Trees Hall, the

Panthers si_Ir;ceeded__ ip_ breaking a
Pitt overall scorein g record of 180.5
despite the 211.10-181.0 defeat‘ at
the hands of the Nittany Lions.
Leading scorer for the Panthers

_ was freshman standout Allan

Myers from Churchill High School,
who turned in an all-around score
of 52.75, an excellent mark"
according to coach Frank D’Amico.

“Allan faced the stiffest compet- I

ition tonight against Penn State
than he‘ will face all year,”
D’Amico said. “This year, Myers

is shooting for a place in the
Eastems. Right.at the moment,
according to his scoring, he is in
third place. The top three scorers
at F.-astems then go on to the
Nationals.”

Rating his teams overall per-
formance, D’Amico said improved
on the pommel horse, the most
difficcult of all men’s events. _

D’Amico—also said the Pantiiiers
were underscored on vaulting by .4
point, but under new rules, a coach
is not permitted to approach the

judges until after the meet.

D’Amico praised. the efforts of
team, members Ken Lunz and Keith
Wipprecht, who competed against
Penn State despite injuries. .

“They both gave one'helluva

effort and really tried ‘to do the
number for us,” D’Amico said.

In Saturday's meet against West
Virginia, the Panthers emerged
victorious, staging a 180.6-176.3
win.

Once again, Myers lead the
Panthers in scoring, placing first in
every event except the pommel
horse, turning in a score of 49.6 in
the all-around competition. i

D’Amico applauded the per-
formance _of the number two team
performer Doug Smith, who scored
a 43.6 in the all-around competition
against the Mountaineers.

“Doug has improved his per-
formance by seven points since last
year, which is just remarkable,”
D’Amico said. -

In the women’s. competition
against Penn State, coach Donna
DeMarino and her Pantherettes
were decisioned 147.35-135.40.

  Pantherettes Dump Bisons
  Despite -Sloppy Play,62-46-

A By MARY SJIUZINEC .

' Pitt News Staff Writer ‘

The - Pantherette basketball
squad handily beat Howard Univer-
sity at the Field House -Monday
night, 62-46, despite an evening of '
sloppy basketball. I '

_.The Pantherettesturned over the
ball 34 times and consistently failed
totake advantage of a weak Bison
zone defense, while boosting their
record to 7-6.

~ “It’s nice to be able to win a
game we played so poorly,” said
coach Jean Balthaser. ‘

A bright spot in the game was
they continued ﬁne play of junior
Barb Welsh, who scored _13 points
and grabbed seven rebounds.

“Barb has been playing consis-
tently well,” said Balthaser. “She
displays leadership on the ﬂoor and

~ sets -up plays. ”

Stephanie Stripling, the junior
transfer student from Montezuma,
Iowa, added 12 points and 16
rebounds to the Pantherette attack.

 Pitt took command of the
slow—paced game from the start.

The lead was never in question

.until center Wanda Randolph left
 the game with aminor ankle sprain

at 6:21, .when the Pantherettes
were leading, 16-14.Howard made
a freethrow on a‘ Stripling foul to
make the score 16-15, but .then she
answered with two free throws of
her own to make it 18-15.

Next, the Bisons made a free
throw on a Rita Rodriguez foul and
tied the score by putting in a
follow-up shot.

Despite missing shots and
committing turnovers, the Panther-
ettes managed to score nine more
points while holding off the Bisons,
taking a 27-18 halftime lead.

In the second half, the Panther-
ettes stretched their lead to 20
points, while Dana Elder ran the
offense point guard.

Every Pitt player saw action in
the second half, which, according
to Balthaser. included poor shot

selection and horrendous rebound-
I118? . ' — .. 4 ’
V “It seems like we don’t get up
for a game unless we’refplaying a
big team,” said Balthaser. V

The Pantherettes will soon have
the opportunity to get up for
several nationally-ranked teams.
Maybe they removed the mental
lapses from their systems Monday.

DeMarino stressed that Penn

with one member, Ann Carr,
ranked last year as the top
women's gymnast in the nation.

“The way they performed on
Friday night they could easily take
the Nationals,” DeMarino said.
“Penn State is the best college
team I haveseen all year,

Top scorer in the women’s
all-around for the Pantherettes was
Myra Bachuchin with a 35.5
score—enough for a th_ird-place
ﬁnish.

The 13.4.05-129.85 win by the
Pantherettes at Morgantown was
under what DeMarino called
“horrendous conditions.”

-“There wasn’t sufficient matting
on the floor,‘ it was cold,
lighting was poor and the teams

 

' ‘kn

were rushed because of a basket-
ball game scheduled to take place
after the meet,” she said. “The
girls would no sooner ﬁnish a
performance than the janitors
would be out on the floor taking up
the mats.

“The team was also pretty beat
after having the meet with Penn
State the night before, but I’m glad
under the circuimstancesvtlhe
team had a good showing.”

DeMarino praised the continual-
ly improving performances of the

lllb

all-around team comprised of Myra '

Bachuchin, Bonnie Tressler, Cindy
Severyn and Alison Hoburg, and
the improved performance of
sophomore, Regina Carson, 1976’s

playing career, arid make himself available toiall the

increasingly commqnplace in pro basketball. Ros_ters
throughout the NBA are dotted with players . who
make it in pro basketball via such a route.

Two years ago, Pitt’s Keith Starr entered his name
to the list of hardship cases. Although he had an
extra year of college eligibility after’ he received a
redshirt as a result of knee injury suffered before his
senior season, Starr decided to pass it up and take a
shot at pro ball. The Chicago Bulls drafted the
Panther swingman on the fourthround in spring
1976.

“After I hurt the knee.” Starr explained recently,
“some doctors told me I might not be able to play
basketball again. When I heard that, I thought it
might be wise to give pro basketball a try. I didn’t
want to give up a chance to play pro ball becuase of
the knee.

“The security a pro offer gave me helped too,”
Starr continued. “It just seemed to be the right move
to make at the time.”

Looking back on the move Starr made, it wasn’t
such a wise one after all—at least as far as his career

with the Chicago Bulls was concerned. Starr is I10

Now,f‘Starr is playing basketball for the 
entry in 9, the newly,,.;c-onceived All-Americanf.  _
Basketball Alliance, a professional basketball league, . 

with eight"Eastern Sieaboarid teams.

 

It has to be a comedown for Starr. Even the
exclusive spot duty he saw with the Bulls last season
has to be better than playing full—time for some
professional league hardly anyone has heard about,
as Starr now is doing on the Wheeling Wheels.

Starr, however, does not see the situation in a
similar light. If he could turn back the clock two
years, and change the situation that led to his leaving

«Pitt and heading west to Chicago, Starr said he

wouldn’t do it again.
“I learned some things about myself as a

basketball player with the Bu_lls,” Starr said. “Now I
know what it takes to make it in professional
basketball.

‘‘I played with some great players,” the 24-year-
old continued. “Playing with Norm Van Lier, for

Langley Hall -- One Year Later

By Dan Rosenthal

‘the

On the fifth floor of Langley Hall,
psychology professor Dr. Donald Meyer
decided it was time for lunch, and
thought he would grab a bite to eat at
the Cathedral. He left his office, en-
tered the elevator and pushed the but-
ton for the first floor. The doors closed,
and as the elevator descended, Meyer
not_iced the odor of natural gas. The far-
ther down he went, the stronger the
smell became, until he reached the bot-
tom floor and the elevator doors
opened.

Meyer, as accustomed to all the dif-
ferent odors in a science complex as
others who frequented the building,
thought little of it and joked with a
custodian in the hallway.

“Man, is that gas strong! What do
you think would happen if I lit a match
right now?” he asked.

‘‘I don’t know,” the custodian said, ‘‘I
guess we would blow up.” They both
laughed and Meyer went to lunch.

In Washington, a Georgia Democrat
had just been sworn in as the 39th
president of the United States. Not
unlike Jimmy Carter, Dr. Kathleen
Dobrielski Vergona had a new title, too.
She was a new assistant professor in
life sciences department, and
though still somewhat apprehensive
about her lectures, she knew they were
going well.

it was the sixth time that Life Scien-
ces 125 had met‘ in Langley Hall Annex
223, and Vergona was planning to con-
tinue her lecture on membranes to more
than 100 students who showed up for
class that day despite the cold weather.

Animal physiology started promptly
at noon in 223 Langley Hall with a brief
review of Tuesday's lecture on the
structure and functions of membranes.
Students were checking their notes and
jotting down things they had missed.
About 12:25, the subject turned to
some of the physiological properties of
insulin.

At 12:30, Vergona checked her
watch to see if she was going to get

writer.

"All we could seem to get out of the

dazed patients was that there were approxi—

motely 100 to 200 students in theclossroom ,

and some were in such a dazed condition

they thought an earthquake had occurred."

through the material she had planned.
Thursday, Jan. 20 was no exception,
and she was about halfway through her

lesson when she glanced at the time.
An overhead projector sat on a table

in front of the long, black lab desk in the
front of the lecture hall, and on a tran-
sparency, Vergona had listed some
specific functions of insulin. It was
12:39. Eleven minutes of class left.
She made her way to the overhead and
flipped the switch on. The students
buried their heads in their notebooks
trying to copy down what they could
before she started explaining what they
saw on the screen. Before she spoke,
she moved toward the class and turned
to look at the screen to see how the
transparency was projecting.

Then, at 12:40, from under their
feet, there was a rumble. Before anyone
had time to realize it was not an earth-
quake, the ceiling began to fall. in
221, the auditorium adjacent to
Vergona’s class, two events occurred in
quick succession. The same rumbling
was followed by a soft crunching sound.
Then the roof blew upward away from
the walls and collapsed onto the seats.
There, 20 minutes earlier, some 220

students were sitting,

cracking and falling.

Next door, students were scrambling
for either of two emergency exjts in the
front of the room. When light fixtures
began to fall, Vergona crawled under
the table the overhead projector was
on.

,“l just kind of huddled there in a fetal
position thinking it would protect me
from anything falling from the ceiling,”
she recalled in an interview recently. ‘‘I
remembervery distinctly seeing stu-
dents’ feet running past me to get out.”

When the fluorescent light fixtures
fell, the room became brighter rather
than darker. Light from outside flooded
the classroom as the wall connecting
the two auditoriums began to tumble on-
to desks. The outside light was hazy
with dust from plaster and cinder
blocks. Most everyone had escaped by
the time Vergona made her way from
under the table. There was an eerie
hus_h as she quickly surveyed the

remaining students out through

 

emergency door and trembled outside
with the rest of those who left safely.

Students running from the building
were surprised to see campus police
already outside Langley. Their two-way
radio dispatch came at 12:42. Officers
Robert Kolesky and Regis Clifford were
the first at the scene.

"l‘ve seen some pretty bad
disasters,” Kolesky said in retrospect,
“but in the 15 years I've been on the
force, We never seen anything that bad
as far as the injuries, massiveness of the
explosion and number of people in-
volved.

“The initial call we got made itsound
like a small explosion in a lab
somewhere. I knew it was something
we had to hurry for, but I didn’t expect
to pull down there and see the whole
building laying out on the road. That just
blew everyone’s mind.”

The same strange hush Kathleen
Vergona remembered was noticed by
Kolesky. After surveying the scene and

radioing back to “get everything you’ve '

got down here,” he ran to the pile of
debris that used to be a lecture hall and
was met by one of the campus police
sergeants.

‘‘It was almost silent,” Kolesky
recalled. “We didn’t hear any screams.
I was looking for hands or feet or
anything; there was nothing. I thought,
‘Well geez, are they all dead?’ ”

That is when several injured students
ran to the officers, some with reports of
people still trapped under the rubble.
Hundreds were treated for minor
abrasions, bruises and cuts. Several
suffered more severe injuries, some
permanent. Law suits seek damages
for injuries to one student’s back,
broken by a falling steel support girder.
Another student sustained a fractured
pelvis and bladder damage, chipped and
loosened teeth and spinal injuries. One
year later, another suit says one student
is suffering from mood swings ranging
from severe depression to false
euphoria. The suit claims he has insom-
nia. memory lapses and a diminished
ability to concentrate as a result of the

Pitt’s Emergency System -- Just in Case    

By Mark Murphy

On Jan. 20, 1977, Joseph Dutton,
Pitt's vice chancellor for business and
finance, was eating lunch at a local
restaurant when he was informed a wing
of Langley Hall had exploded. From the
time of the disaster to the time Dutton
learned of it, less than one minute had
elapsed. Dutton immediately
proceeded to the explosion site and
began helping to coordinate rescue ef-
forts.

The speed with which the vice chan-
cellor learned of the Langley Hall in-
cident is an example of the University’s
emergency response procedures. At
the time of last year's explosion, no
response procedures had been written.
Today, as a result of the blast, the
University has written formalized
response procedures.

“We didn't have formal procedures
during Langley Hall, but that's how we
acted,” said John Vrana, assistant to

the vice chancellor for business and

finance and leader of a task force for-
med to study response policies. “We
decided to take a look at what we did
well, study it and codify it.

“These are actual procedures that
would be employed in the event of a
disaster,” Vrana continued. “They em-
phasize communication and respon-

sibility. Depending upon the nature’ of —

the emergency, various departments
would be called to assist. Most of the
groups have been asked to form their
own internal guidelines, consistent with
the University’s.”

in the case of an emergency, each
University department is contacted, and
uses its own communication system to
spread information to departmental

’_ major, is a copy editor for The Pitt

News.

workers. Soon, everyone knows of the
emergency and is expected to be doing
some designated job; .

The guidelines have changed little
since Langley Hall, according to Vrana.
“Our campus police always have had
their own internal procedures.”

One important outcome of the Vrana-
led task force was the final definition of
an emergency, according to the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh. The emergency
response procedure report, distributed
to all University departments, states:

“For purposes of these procedures,
an emergency is defined as any unex-
pected or sudden situation that affects
the safety of persons or property on the
buildings and grounds of the University
of Pittsburgh. Examples of such
emergencies include, but are not limited
to, fires in the University facilities, ex-
plosions or disasters occurring in or ad-
jacent to University facilities, criminal
endangering of lives, closing down

campus facilities for weather or energy
emergencies, accidents in which
serious personal injury or property
damage occurs on the campus, natural
disasters caused by severe weather
conditions, civil disturbances or
unauthorized occupancy of campus
areas."

There are 53 ‘buildings and 120
acres of ground ‘composing the Pitt
campus. That creates many oppor-
tunities for emergencies. According to
the report, if the emergency occurs
during normal working hours, the cam-
puspolice are notified first. The senior
police official on duty sends police to
the scene, then notifies seven offices:
the City of Pittsburgh Police and/or Fire
Departments; Plant Services and
Building Maintenance; Student Affairs (if
students are involved); Public Affairs
and News and Publications; Business
and Finance; the Health Professions,
and the Chancellor's Office.

_If the ‘emergency occurs on a
weekend or after working hours, the
procedure is the same, although ad-
ministrators must be contacted at their
homes. Included in thelreport is alist of
people to be contacted, and first and
second alternates if the department
heads cannot be reached. The depart-
ment leaders range from the chancellor
and provost, to the head of University
Housing and Food Service, the athletic
director and the Computer Center direc-
tor.

In the case of a Langley Hall-type
emergency, the chancellor, or the first
vice chancellor to arrive on the scene,
takes control and decides to what
degree procedures should be put into
effect and whether a command center
should be established. Unless other-
wise notified by the chancellor, the first
arriving vice chancellor remains in
charge, and all other officials report to
him.

If the emergency requires com-
munication to students, several steps
are taken: The University switchboard
is notified, and is instructed to relay and
respond to information and inquiries;
public address announcements are
made: the Student Affairs office staff
and resident assistants are used as fact-

dispensers in the Student Union and
dormitories. (Staff and resident assist-
ants were particularly useful during the
confusion immediately after the Langley
Hall incident). Other messengers are
pressed into service as needed.
Concurrent with this, police activate
the Emergency Medical Alert to local
hospitals (if necessary), assist in treat-
ment and rescue of injured persons,
seek assistance from operating
engineers and plant personnel concern-
ing the threat or damage to University
property, and help in the evacuation and
security of the emergency site, and
crowd and traffic control at the scene.

if a command center is necessary, -

one is established in the Chancellor’s
Office (Room 107' Cathedral of Learn-
ing), from which many decisions are
made. if required, the command center
can be moved or set up elsewhere.
During Langley Hall, a command center
was established in the Chancellor’s of-
fice, and Room 121 Cathedral was
used as the information center for media
personnel.

For communications between the
emergency site and command center,
two-way radios, using a predetermined,
unused frequency, are brought in.
Walkie-talkies are employed to facilitate
direct and instant communication.
Phone lines also are used, with
operators instructed to keep one line
open atall times.

If injuries occur, certain offices have
the responsibility for dealing with injured
parties and/or their parents and families.
For students, Student Affairs is used;
for faculty, the Provost’s Office is used;
for staff, the Personnel Office is em-
ployed.

Beside emergencies of the most
serious nature, the University is
prepared to deal with campus disrup-
tions and protests, whether known in
advance or staged spontaneously. De-
pending upon who is causing the disrup-
tions, either Student Affairs (if the prin-
cipals are students) or Legal Services (if
the principals are faculty or staff) must
gather information and make the
decision as to how fully response
procedures should be implemented.

Pitt’s response procedures have also
been used in non-University emergen-
cies._ The best example of this is Pitt’s
help during the Johnstown flood of last
July. Pitt was quick to establish com-
municationsand help provide services
for the community through its Johns-
town campus.

According to the published
definitions of an emergency, at least
four emergencies occurred at Pitt last
winter. During the Langley Hall
emergency, the full response
procedures, described above, were
employed. There were at least three
weather-related school closings-
emergencies by the reports defini-
tions—and these set the response

mechanism into motion. Because of the ‘

lack of danger to people and buildings
during school closings. these emergen-
cies are handled differently than more
serious emergencies: hospitals are not
on alert and city police and ‘fire depart-
ments are not summoned.

“There were a lot of people just kind
of walking around in a stupor. They
were in a state of disbelief," Kolesky
said. “They couldn’t believe what had
happened. it was as if they were going
to go crazy if they didn't get an ex-
planation right then and there for the
explosion." _

“One of the ones I recall was a
woman janitor who was hysterical. She
was actually blown down the hall and
just couldn’t believe something that
forceful had occurred. It didn't want to
register in her brain that something like
that had happened and she was just

lucky to be alive. That's what a few of,

them were saying, ‘I don’t know why I’m
alive.’ " _.
There was awesome physical
evidence of the explosion that killed two
women and injured, a University report
says, at least 58 other persons. The
blast damaged more than 10 Langley
Hall rooms, including the two lecture
halls, the Langley Hall Library, the
psychology department’s Project Right

 .Start office’ and a microscopy lab.

Destroyed in the lab was some expen-
sive analytical equipment. A microspec-
trophotometer and three electron

_ microscopes, with a combined value of

at least $1 75,000, were lost.

Police reports say the microscopes
were near the center of the lab, and it
was possible to see where they were
sitting prior to 12:40 Jan. 20. Each
microscope weighs about one ton, and
the force of the blast pushed them back
14 feet.

As word of the tragedy spread
throughout the campus, students were
struck with a sober mood and concern.

lasses during the rest of the afternoon

were sparsely attended, and people
were scurrying about checking to see
where their friends were. No one was
left untouchedby the explosion. Now, a
year later, people still remember what
they were doing and where they were at
the time of the explosion.

While Campus and city police were
busy with rescue operations, securing
the C|app—Langley-Crawford complex
and trying to control traffic throughout
Oakland, University personnel, city fire
fighters, students, government agen-

cies. private businesses, hospitals and_

community organizations began their
wn efforts and responded with a com-
, .on sense of solicitude to the tragedy.
For example:
—Corporations immediately provided
heavy equipment to assist in rescue and
clearance operations.
—Students, faculty and staff members
turned out in large numbers in response
to Central Blood Bank’s request for
Many had to be turned away
because the blood bank could not
process the blood as fast as it was
being donated. _
The Duquesne University and Car-
'egie-Mellon University campus police
"volunteered their assistance in rescue
efforts.
—Bed ‘Cross and Salvation Army
workers assisted rescuers.
—Student Government members and
WPGH, the campus radio station, asked

students to Contact their parents to let
them know they were not injured.
Thousands did contact loved ones to
assure them they were safe, but
thousands of loved ones did not wait to
hear. Minutes after the explosion, calls
came in to the University at alarming
rates, to the surprise of an unknowing 1
switchboard operator who knew nothing
of what was happening on the outside.
The staff of the Student Affairs office
began to coordinate efforts to contact
students who were registered for
classes in the Langley Hall extension
between noon and 1 p.m. Any infor-
mation they could get to minimize the
anxiety of calling parents would help.
Student volunteers took incoming calls
from concerned parents and relatives in
Trafford and South Hills and as far away
as Tel Aviv and Seoul. The phones rang
steadily until 8 pm., when all but 15
students had been accounted for. E

The next day, those 15 had been
|ocated—most weren’t in the building at
the time. Two women ‘had been
pronounced dead: Patricia Hostetler,
20, of Donegal, a student in room 223,
and Carleen Curry, 35, of Oakland, a
secretary for the psychology depart-
ment's Project Right Start program.

By Jan. 21 , when officials were con-
vinced there were no other victims and
the site was relatively secure, the
Allegheny County Cor-oner’s Office,

supplies and chemicals located in the
Langley Hall extension prior to the ex-
plosion; Those items were examined

along with Pittsburgh police and fire
departments, Pitt campus police, the
state Public Utility Commission (PUC)

and soil samples from the area were
taken and analyzed. Persons inside or
near Langley Hall when it exploded

were interviewed. Chancellor Wesley
Posvar insisted every effort be made to
determine the cause of the blast and
directed all employees of the University
to cooperate with authorities in the in-
vestigation. Posvar also expressed
\

and the Equitable Gas Company began
the painstaking task of reconstructing
the explosion to try and determine its
cause. Debris at the site was examined.
The life sciences department: housed in
Langley, prepared lists of equipment,

I Remember . . .

Last year, the Pitt News intervieweda student who was in Langley Hall at the
time of the explosion. Lon Voisey, then a Pitt senior, is now a student at Tem-
ple’s Dental School. He said in a phone interview recently that he doesn’t think
about the blast often now, except to worry about the people who were severely
hurt in the accident.

Voisey sustained a slight head injury, but was treated and released the day of
the blast. _

“l’m removed from it here in Philadelphia. No one discusses it with me,”
Voisey said. “But I‘ knew the date was coming up,-Jan. 20: it was inauguration
day last year.”

Voisey was in a senior physiology class in 220 Langley at the time of the ex-
plosion. He was taken to a hospital for x-rays but was not hurt. He is disturbed
because, “l really don’t know what happened to the people who weren’t as lucky
as I was.

“A psychologist came to talk to the class about a month afterwards. She told -
us what to expect and what not to. l-’m still kind of jumpy around loud noises."

In last year’s interview, Voisey said he had a few nightmares about the" ex-
plosion, but no longer has them.

Voisey said he is not satisfied with the investigation. “Last time I heard, it was
stillinconclusive. I heard the officialinvestigation said it was a minor gas leak, but
concurring reports said a gas leak that minor could not have caused as powerful
an explosion.” '

“The blast has been replaced by other things to worry about," Voisey said,
‘adding that dental school is keeping him busy. “lt was one of those things that
happen to some people and doesn't happen to'others. l wouldn’t want it to hap-

pen again, but if that was my closest brush for life, that's fine with me."

concern and sorrow for those injured,
and visited the families of Patricia

Hostetler and Carleen Curry. _
Four days after the explosion, Vice
Chancellor for Public Affairs Bernard
Kobosky issued a statement after an in-
formation-sharing session with
Allegheny County coroner Cyril Wecht,
representatives from various in-

vestigative agencies and Pittscientists _

and experts. As to the cause of the
blast, Kobosky said:

—“We believe we can rule out at this
time that the explosion was caused by 2
bomb." 

+“Ther_e is no evidence of any
chemicals that are known to have been

’ used in academic or research activities

that would have caused an explosion of
this extent.”
—“The possibility of a gas explosion
seems to be the most plausible based
upon the evidence collected to date.”

Wecht called for an open inquest to
be held Feb. 10 and 1 1 to determine if
there was evidence of any criminal
negligence resulting in the two deaths.
Prior to the inquest, an analysis of soil
samples taken near the Langley site by
the PUC was released. An Equitable
gas line, running north-south along Ten-
nyson Avenue between Clapp and
Langley Halls, contained gas and was
leaking. When the line was uncovered
by Equitable Gas, a break was founu
near a joint. A six-foot section of the
pipe was excavated and subsequently
sent by Equitable Gas to an indepen-
dent testing firm in Houston, Texas, for
analysis.

The section of pipe sent away for
examination was taken from a line that

forms a semi-circle down one side of‘

two valves connecting the line to an
Equitable main on Bigelow Boulevard.
The 70-year-old semi-circular line, it
was discovered, had gas in it, though it
had not been tapped for commercial use
in more than 30 years.

The coroner ordered the pipe in
Texas back to Pittsburgh to be used as
evidence at the inquest. The two-day
inquest involved testimony from detec-
tives, eyewitnesses, Pitt officials, PUC
representatives and Equitable attor-
neys. As more information about the
blast was uncovered, it seemed that
natural gas was the most probable
cause. However, Wecht found no
criminal negligence.

The coroner’s inquest is history now,
but there is one theory discussed at the
inquest that is sure to find its way into
the courtroom when a jury finally hears
the more than $2 million dollars in‘ legal
suits pending in connection with the ex-
plosion. The theory says gas was
leaking for an undetermined amount of
time (Equitable says the line was in-
spected one month before the blast)

resistance happened to be a crawl
space under Langley Hall 223. That is
where gas accumulated and authorities
believe Carleen Curry, termed a

“medium smoker” by her employer,

sparked the blast when she lit a
cigarette during her lunch break.

Stuart Corp. (the company that built
Langley Hall) are responsible.

While various parties dispute who is
responsible for the incident, students

still walk up Tennyson Avenue and see‘

the bulldozed cavity where the Langley
Hall annex stood prior to Jan. 20.

"The first day back in the classroom

I thought, now if there was an emergency,

how would I get out of this room?"

Dr. Kathleen Vergoda

The official investigation of last
January's explosion at Langley Hall has
concluded, but the matter is far from
settled. Seven lawsuits are pending
and at least two more are expected to
be filed in the near future.

The University is claiming Equitable
Gas is responsible for the leaking gas
line that Pitt says should not have con-
tained gas in the first place. Injured par-

Unapproved plans have been drawn
up for a new structure to be built on the

until a damage estimate is jointly accep-
ted by the State Department of General
Services, which owns Langley‘ Hall, and
their insurance company. The estimate,
which isexpected to be more than $1
million, may be approved by the end of

Putting the Hostetler-Curry Memorial Fund to Use

Approximately $700 collected in a memorial fund to honor Langley Hall vic-
tims Patricia Hostetler and .Carleen Curry will be spent next month. The Hostetler
-Curry Memorial Book Fund will purchase books to be set aside as a special
collection in one of the University’s libraries, possibly in Langley Hall. A plaque
bearing the names of the two women killed in last year's explosion will be placed

above the collection.

The memorial fund was established by student organizations and ad-
ministrators in an organized drive after last year’s blast.

Pitt’s Office of Development and Alumni Affairs housed the funds in a Univer- A

recover from the incident, but things are
not the same in many respects. One
year later, not only do students report
that instructors are more careful about
smoking regulations, and similar rules,

but Pitt has purchased a new, highly-
sensitive hydrocarbon analyzer capable
of detecting natural gas, as one Pitt of-
ficial put it, “even before the nose can.”
Pitt owns several gas detecting
devices, and since last year, they are
being used with much greater fre-
quency. Internal emergency
procedures have been codified to keep
open lines of communication that may
become clogged in the event of future
emergencies.

Vergona is teaching Life Sciences
125, animal physiology, again this term,
and she says she’s‘no longer excited
by any little noise. For a week or'tw0 af-
ter the explosion, though, she would
jump anytime a radiator hissed or a book
fell on the flo0r,'she said recently.

“The first day back in the classroom I
thought, now if there was an emergen-
cy, how would I get out of this room?"
Vergona said. “Everyone should be
aware of where an emergency exit and
another alternate exit are. I've made a
note to make sure each of my students
ask themselves the samewquestion.
There were two exits in our room last
year, and I'm sure that saved some
Iives.”
