Ruby Dee Speaks on

. /,

Poetry, Cinema, Blacks

" by DAVE MAJERNIK

Ruby Dee, black actress, poet, and writer. spoke and performed to
some 200 people in the Student Union Ballroom on Mondayevening.

Aboiit Wedding Bands, her latest play, she said it was a good play
on many levels. It is about thwarted love and the universality of love.

she said.

Asked about the current trend in black movies, she replied that
there :must be something to them because they are successful. It’s a
chance to see our black faces on the screen.

According to Dec, the legitimate theater is dying. She explained
that it is just as expensive to put on a Broadway production for one night
._ as it is to make a film. “We are moving toward ‘a theater of ideas,” she
said. “The theater will change to meet the needs of the times."

Dee pointed out that few opportunities existed for young actors
and actresses. Of the 15,000 actors in New York, she said, 14,250 are

making less than $2,000 per year.

“My mother fostered myinterest in poetry," she said reminiscing

about her childhood years in Harlem.

Dee said -that black writers can make a tremendous contribution
to the world. “Black writers think in at different way and yearn a dif-

ferent way,” she said.

“We (blacks) have that extra sensitivity. We are often the forgers

of change,” she,said.

“We blacks must look within ourselves rather than outside our-

selves,” she said.

“Not having food is not the hardest thing in life to endure,” said
Dee, “but not having a direction in life is.”

It was easier for blacks to "be accepted as singers because they
were allowed to sing as slaves, but thethinking role of actors.- poet. and
novelist is not as acceptable for blacks, she said. ‘

“In the film Buck and the Preacher, I got a chance to work with
two of my buddies, learn how to ride a horse, and be in New Mexico."

she said.

“Besides,” added Dee, "it was a good part.“
About poets, she said, they are “the gods of the world, and next to

them were novelists and playwrights.

,/

_ After answering questions from the audience. Dee read selections
from the works of contemporary black poets. 9

Before Dee’s appearance, an interdenominational choir composed

chiefly of Pitt students, called “Some of God’s Children," sang several

numbers.

The program was sponsored by the Black’ Action Society.

/ViIA's Fate Still Unknown

by DON McLEOD
Associated Press Writer
WASHINOTON (AP) — Despite
the Vietnam peace agreement.
there are some 1,300 Americans
still unaccounted for in Southeast

Asia—including some the North‘

Vietnamese and Viet Cong once
boasted of capturing.

The Pentagon says it has a list
‘of 53 men it believes were.cap-

tured alive. But no mention of the

men has been made in the cur- ‘
, rent prisoner exchange of more

than 500 American POWs.

The reluctance of the North
Vietnames to acknowledge the
fate of these men soon may lead
to another wave of protest by fam-
ilies and sympathizers if the men
aren’t accounted for before the
current prisoner exchange is
closed.

Among the men believed by the
Pentagon to have been captured
is Navy Lt. Ronald Wayne Dodge.
who was shot down on a mission
over North Vietnam on May 17.
1967. His wingman saw him eject
from the crippled plane and estab-
lished contact from the ground

_ with his survial radio. “I’m mov-

ing up the hill,” Dodge radioed.

"being surrounded and breaking
up my radio."

The Sept. 9. 1967. issue of Paris
Match carried a photograph of
Docge being escorted by two mili-
tianmen. The Dutch freelance
photographer who took the pic-
ture said it was made in Hanoi.

Movie films reaching the west
later showed Dodge being led by
the same men and walking under
his own power.

But Dodge has never been rec-
ognized by North Vietnam as a
prisoner or having died in cap-
tivity. Requests for information
have brought only ‘the statement
from Hanoi authorities that he
was “never detained in North
Vietnam.”

Army Sgt. James Van Bende-
gom of Kenosha. Wis.. was one of
seven men reported missing on
July 12, 1967, near Pleiku, South
Vietnam. In December, 1967, a
picture appeared in a North Viet-
namese newspaper showing Van
Bendegom and three of the other
missing men in captivity.

All four were shown standing.
They were apparently in good
health and under guard. The other
three are on the POW lists. Van

Help for interested Students

PittPre-Veterinary Club Formecl it

by LARRY PANSINO

A new club to help students 10-
cate and secure opportunities in
veterinary medicine was formed
Thursday night by interested un-
dergraduates.

The Pitt Pre-Veterinary Clubtis
designed to pool members‘ know-
ledge of veterinary courses and
graduate schools so as to facili-
tate the making of contacts and
the securing of jobs ‘within the
profession.

Only 18 veterinary schools exist
in the country, and no pre-vet
courses or advisors have been es-
tablished at Pitt. Qualifications
for admission to one of the veteri-
nary schools are basically the

APPLICATIONS for the Intercul-
tural House (IC) are available
for the fall, 1973 term.

The IC is a partial scholarship‘
house in which blocks and
whites and foreign students live
together, work on specific com-
munity-related or international
projects, and learn through shar-
ing of one another’s culture. The
focus is on black and white
American cultures, with foreign
cultures present as catalytic
agents.

The scholarship corresponds to 1
full room payment. Applications
are available at the Student Un-
ion Information Desk or at the

IC House, 272 North Dithridge.

same as those for medical schools,
and pre-vet students follow al-
most the same curriculum as pre-
med students.

The club plans to lobby for the
initiation of a zoology course in
the Biology Department, because

many veterinary schools recom- .

mend that applicants take courses

UAR Policy

for Current

by MONICA CIROCCO ’ V
The Fall 1972 Undergraduate
Academic Review (UAR) is
scheduled to be distributed tomor-
row. Editor Phil Keryan explain-
ed that the major change in the

_UAR’s forthcoming edition is in

its editorial policy.

Last year, if a teacher request-
ed that his class be surveyed, the
policy of the UAR required that
the results were to "be printed, re-
gardless of whether the professor
agreed with them or not.

In the spring of 1972 the editors
of the UAR, in discussion with the
Center for the Improvement of
Teaching. (CIT), decided to change

thispolicy. A professor now;has.
_the" option of~‘having the results.

 

Bendegom is not; nor has he been   ,
reported dead in captivity. 1

Typical of another problem is; 
Army Capt. Robert M. Young, 
who was captured in South Viet-' )5
nam on May 2, 1970, and reported -
by Hanoi Radio to beaprisoner, ‘ - 

As late as last October, Young? ‘
was reported by Hanoi Radio to
have‘ been one ofv14 American»-,1;
prisoners of war who signed an
antiwar statement. But when the  ._
cease-fire was announced three 
months later, Young was listed
asdeadincaptivity. - {ff

The Pentagon refuses to dis- 7
close the list ofi53 names. It says‘ 
it lacks conclusive evidence in’ 
some cases that the men were
captured alive. ‘

The U.S. government is press-
ing the issue through routine dip: 
lomatic channels but not makingfi
a big public issue of it. The,ideai'_..-'3
within the government and among 
many of the families is not to rock ;.,."
the boat while some men- are 
coming home. ’i 

  

- “But there is going to come a‘ ,
point when we will have to act,” 3"
one spokesman f'or MIA families  ’
said. “We are not going to accep . ;
these lists/indefinitely.” ‘-

in the subject. Presently, pre-vet ‘
students at Pitt must cross regis-‘ _’
ter—to Carlow College for a zoo-'

logy course. » “

Representation at freshmen 
orientation is also planned to in- 
form prospective pre-med stu? 
dents of the option of veterinary .-
study. ‘ ‘,1

Changes  ,
Evaluation 3:

printed or not, the decision rest- ,
ingwith the professor after he has _ 
seen the evaluation.

Keryan states that this new po-._ . ,
licy, on a one year trial basis from * .
Spring of 1972 to 1973, was con- .
ceived with the hope of getting all 
courses reviewed. ' . 

Because of the new’ option for‘
professors to refuse to have eval-
uations published, Keryan feels  __
that “more and more professors 
will be willing to have their-"
courses reviewed. It should have 
a ‘snowballing’ effect.” ' ‘"" 

    
  
  

In support of his theory, Keryan  ~
noted that the Fall ‘72 issue has”
more courses published than ever
before. V, A i -  v-

Improved Status Sought
for Household. Workers

In 1970. approximately one and
one-half million women were em-
ployed as private household work-
ers. In fact women constituted 97
per cent of all workers in private
household employment.

Over the past decade, because
of the significant number of wom-
en entering the labor market, the
need for household workers, in-
cluding babysitters, has rapidly
increased. Yet the number of such
workers has been steadily declin-
ing. '

Occupations in which there is a
growing demand are usually, invit-
ing fields to enter, but in this case
the decline is easily explained.

Unlike other job classifications”

increased need has not been ac-
increased pay,

fringe benefits, or improved stat-
us. .-

Sixty-six per cent of household
employees earn less than $1.500
per year. The poverty level rec-
ognized by the Federal Govern-
ment is $1,840 for an individual
and $3,743 for a family of four.

This means that the majority
of household workers, and 250,-
000 of them are heads of house-
holds. are living in poverty. These

workers are not afforded the pro- V

tection of the Minimum Wage and
Hours Law, and are rarely cover-
ed by social security benefits, nor
do they receive the protection of
Workmen’s Compensation or Un-
employment Compensation or
simple fringe benefits enjoyed by
other workers such as vacation
and sick leave.

The Governor's Council on Drug
and Alcohol Abuse is sponsoring a
statewide study to determine the
incidence and prevalence of drug
and alcohol use and abuse.

Dr. Richard E. Horman. execu-
tive director of the Council. said
the comprehensive survey will en-
compass the state but will focus
on 11 randomly selected counties
from Feb. 26 through April 6.

Governor Milton J. Shapp pro-
posed the formation of the Coun-
cil which was created in June,
1972, by Act 63 of the General As-
sembly. This June, as required by
Act 63, the Governor’s Council
will be unveiling the statewide
plan for meeting the drug and al-
cohol abuse problems in the Com-
monwealth. “As part of our plan-
ning efforts and in order to obtain
support from the Federal Gov-
ernment for staffing as well as
funds for prevention and treat-
ment programs, Pennsylvania
must be able to describe specific
areas of need,” Horman explain-
ed.

“In some communities. for
example. the state may find it im-
perative to concentrate on drug
education as a preventive meas-
ure in schools. In other commun-
ities there may be a critical short-
age of alcohol treatment clinics."
Horman said a study of this type
will assist the Governor’s Council
and local units of government in
making appropriate policy deci-
sions regarding state and county
planning.

As part of the survey. a random
sample of 3.000 private citizens
will be interviewed in Philadel-
phia. Chester. Montgomery. Dela-
ware. Dauphin. Lehigh. Alle-
gheny. Beaver. Butler. Franklin.
and Fulton Counties during the six
week period.

Drug Abuse Council Formed

Questionnaires went into the
mail on Feb. 23 to 6,500 local offi-
cials throughout the 67 counties
of the Commonwealth. These in-
dividuals include public health
officers, law enforcement offi-
cials, representatives of the ju-
dicial system, school officials,
representatives of major treat-
ment programs, mayors, and
other local government officials.

In addition there will be a ran-
dom survey of 300 institutionaliz-
ed individuals as well as a study
of records in the 11 representa-
tive counties.

All aspects of the incidence and
prevalence study are being con-
ducted by representatives of Kir-
schner Associates. Inc. Their re-
sults will be used as the basis for
estimating the extent of the drug
and alcohol problem in Penns_vl—
vania communities.

Local citizens in the 11 coun-

ties involved are assured by the
Governor’s Council that inter-

viewers from Kirschner Associ-
ates will have proper identifica-
tion when calling at their homes.

Homes have been selected by
chance and no identities will be
recorded. “Complete confidential-
ity of names, addresses, and an-
swers is being guaranteed,” Hor-
man said. Respondents will be
given the opportunity to check
their responses and may drop
their questionnaires into a sealed
ballot container at the end of the
interview. The interview will be
brief and take only about 15 min-
utes.

Horman said the Council views
this survey as an opportunity for
the general public to express its
opinions on the drug and alcohol
situation. “In the process individ-
ual citizens will be helping to en-
able the Governor’s Council to
make better value judgments
when approving the allocation of
funds available from both the
state and federal governments."

Pothole Becomes Lake Bigelow

Male chauvinists may oppose
filling the hole on the grounds it
will preclude any attempts on
their part to daringly whisk young
ladies away from the puddle to
keep them from being splashed.

With so many liberated women
at Pitt, a romantic male is likely
to find that such a bold rescue
move results only in a jaw that
doesn’t work. As I said, we need a
solution.

Simply take the _“lake” idea and
go all the way: dredge out the pud-
dle and build a dam across Forbes
and the Schenley Plaza parking
lot. Then, using drainage from
Bigelow Blvd. and a few local fire
hydrants, the area could be filled
with water.

Presto! Lakes Bigelow"li/s/form-
ed!

Auto traffic would be rerouted
to Fifth Ave., since it was sup-
posed to be changed to two-way
operation long ago. You: say.
though, thatcrossing Lake Bige-
low would be worse than jumping
the puddle. No sweat.

The University is already plan-
ning for a‘ pedestrian bridge

fact, The Press described in
great detail the massive effort of
the state in ridding society of this
unwanted visual blight. slime-
where in Johnstown, a billboard
has met its fate. * -

Now, enter the Pennsylvania
Lottery Commission. One must
have noticed, on the Bigelow side
of the Bloomfield Bridge waiting

to greet traffic, there is a blue and

green billboard proclaiming “No
Tickee, No Money.” On the Mill--
vale side of the Washington Cross-
ing, again in blue and green, there
also lies another one. Admitted
that the Pennsylvania Lottery

     

across Forbes Ave. And until it
is constructed, Pitt could arrange
to have one of the famous cam-
pus buses traded in on a ferry
boat to shuttle students across
the lake.

The old men who hustle parking
spaces in the Schenley lot could be
employed to rent out canoes to
students for reasonable rates.

Meter Maids could be given I

swim fins or motor boats so that
they could tag illegally docked
canoes. These fine ladies would
then be called Mer-metermaids
or simply Motormaids.

Swimmers who don’t like the
Trees Hall pool could take dips

_in ‘Lake Bigelow. too. During the

summer they could tan them-
selves on the Hillman Library
“sundeck.”

The Student Union’s first floor
could be converted into a com-
bination locker; room-bathhouse.
The Union lawn would be covered
with sand and made— into a beach,
with wooden benches provided for
the displaced SU crowd.

Most importantly, placid. Lake

Commission is not the same as
the Pennsylvania'4D.epartment of
Transportation, and, that the zon-
ing laws possibly permit bill-
boards to be displayed in this par-

ticular location, are both facts. /

The Press editorial, however,

/‘does mention something about the

“public interest.” Now, Iask you,
learned people of the University,
is it in the “public interest” to
pay $24,000 for the demise of one

canreally understand. “I know them college,kids,”
she says, “they was always trying to :take ad-

From now on, according to Miss Henry, course
listings will be simplified to a total of two entries:
the three letter computer code and the class per-
iod. This is expected to speed billing procedures by
at least 70 per cent.

W Computer codes, in addition,» willlbe randomiz-
ed, at least until normal attrition eliminates those
students who are able to guess the identity of
courses by their alphabetical position. For in-

A stance,.,it is now possible to guess that a course
coded EJQ might be in the English or Economics de-

Theaelimination of course numbers follows en-

guage the difficulty of a course strictly on the
basis of its number; graduate courses, for instance,

always being numbered in ‘the 200 series. With this

 

action of the Renumeration Committee this will no
longer be possible.

The new Time Schedule of Courses is expected
to take up no -more than two standard sheets of
paper. Theksavings will be considerable. Our occa-

For Pete’s Sake  

by MIKE MILLER

‘Anyone who takes a lively interest in the "Pittsburgh mayor-
alty election can gain tremendous insights into the affairs at
city hall by recalling a Simon and Garfunkle song in which they
inform their listeners that “It’s all happening at the zoo.”

A proper adaptation of this popular ditty could do wonders
for the incumbent if used properly. - _ .

\‘A candidate can stand or fall on the strength of his cam-
paign. Remember John Tabor?

A possible re-arrangement of the words could produce a
jim dandy campaign theme. Profanity and slander must be
avoided so for Pete’s sake we’ll' keep it clean.

g It could run something like this:

“Hizzoner stands for honesty.

The DA’s insincere,

And the journalists are kindly, but they’re dumb.
School children are skeptical,

Of changes in their cages,

And the Sheriff is very fond of rum.
The council is reactionary,
Detectives are missionaries.
Teachers plot in secrecy,

The Vice Squad turns on frequently. _
What a gas! You gotta come and see
At the zoo.” '

With a campaign song such as this the voters would turn out
in droves to put the mayor where he belongs.

Letters to the Editor

Civilian Prisoners

Editor, The Pitt News:

Feb. 28-March 1 has been set
aside to focus international atten-
tion on civilian political prisoners
in South Vietnam. To date, esti-
mates are that more than 200,000
civilians are being held for
crimes of neutrality, conscien-
tious objection, adverse editorial
writing, running in an election on
a peace platform, etc. The U.S.
has played a major role in equip-
ping, funding, and advising the
Saigon national police. The U.S.
has also built and paid for the in-
famous “tiger cages.” '

Many of us who have become
aware of this situation have ob:
tained lists of these political pris-
oners and have written congress-
men, State Department officials,
and the President regarding the
fate of these people and our re-

‘ sponsibility to them. We are ask-
ing that our leaders help to:

1) Ensure quick and safe re-
lease of these civilian prisoners of
war. ' ‘

2) Ensure that those arrested

2 for politically motivated reasons

are not now reclassified as

- "criminals” to-avoid pressure for

their release.

3) Curtail funding of the pre-
sent Saigon administration in pro-
test against the continuing ab-
sence of fundamental liberties—'

liberties which are guaranteed,

by the cease-fire accords.

We invite anyone interested in
this concern to visit or call the
Friends Peace Center for more

L information.

Sincerely,
Peter W. Knapp

K Criminal Offense .

Editor, The Pitt News:

I think it’s time for someone to
decree that smoking is a_ criminal
offense. I would even go so far as
to permit a person suffering from
emphysema, etc, to make a citi-
zen’s arrest of any smoker in-
vading his environment, if the
smoker refuses a request to re-
frain. For too long, non-smokers

ly displaying

have acquiesced and permitted
one of society’s chief polluters,
the smoker, to indulge in the fil-
thy habit of lighting up finely
ground up garbage and releasing
its by-products without any
qualms of ‘all innocent adjacent
persons.

Why do employers permit this
offender to continue this practice
at the expense of non-productiv-
ity? Did you ever realize how
much time is spent in lifting,
lighting, and oh, yes, s-m-o-k-
i-n-g a cigarette? I insist every-
one (excepting the handicapped),
needs two hands to work, so it
follows that smokers are half as
efficient as non-smokers.

And then, did you ever stop to
observe the smoker as he utilizes
tobacco? First, he inhales and im-
mediately his physiognomy under-
goes a whole syndrome of inane
expressions. He might scowl,
frown, grimace, and appear to be
in agony, but never will he surren-
der the burning stick; oh no, he
will sustain any unpleasantry the
weed offers and drag on it to the

send in spite of coughing, spitting

out bits of paper, heaving, and a
whole chain of repulsive self-in-
duced distresses. '

He is broadcastingvto the whole
world the fact that he has never
progressed the infantile stage of
obeying his oral impulses. He
should be shunned like a leper. He
should. be castigaged for flagrant-
something that
should be a secret vice. Let him
smoke if he must in the confines

‘of his home; but let him discon-

tinue to pollute the area of free
air and oxygen that is everyone’s
birthright. ,

The Owl

History For 83 Cents APound

by JOHN METCALFE

I have been dawdling. The cur-
rent edition of the Owl runs some
612 pages, and it took some time
to read. Now the Owl is about to
wing away to its mysterious nest-
ing grounds in the far frozen
North once again. After the sixth
of March it will no longer be avail-
able.

It would be a pity to miss the
Owl.

The Owl is one of the most im-
pressive objects I have seen in a
long and misspent (in good years)
life. It is enormous. The book is
eight and half by 11 inches, and
about two and a half inches thick.
It weighs seven pounds six
ounces. It contains thousands of
photographs, many in full color,
and a great many words besides.

In the front of the book the Owl
asks the question: “What is the
University?” I will divulge the
answer, which appears on page 58.

The answer‘ alone is probably
worth six dollars.

Now that you wish to buy the
answer, here’s what you get for
nothing. There is a good repre-

sentation of the physical reality
of the University and the sur-
rounding community. There is a
good survey of events here at Pitt

during the last school year, ar- ,

ranged in the order events hap-
pened. There are photographs and
descriptions of the various or-
ganizations working their curious
magic within the halls of soot in-
stead of ivy. There are innumer-
able individuals doing everything
from lounging on the Cathedral
lawn to riding unicycles.

There are mug shots of those
who have graduated to a different
if not better world. '

Just try to imagine several
thousand photographs of the Uni-
versity. They are all here.

In addition,»services and activ-
ities you may never have heard
of are" explained in great detail.
The book may help you find your-
self, wherever you left it.

The books appears to be ex-
tremely durable; some of the per-
sons pictured in it may go: on to
prominence in the real world.

When that day comes, you should
have your copy ready, so as to
confront them with the way they

looked in the dear dead days of

the early seventies.

It would alsoadd class to your
bookshelf. The dark blue padded
cover is decorated with an excel-
lent representation of the Univer-
sity emblem, complete with Latin
motto.

It is a practical investment as

well. The book, in view of its great ,’
weight, can be used to block doors,

against hurricane winds and all
but the most determined of law

enforcement officers. In a pinch it P — V I

would serve to chock the off wheel

The opportunity is limited. Find

six dollars. Then rush to the Stu—.

push four, get off at the right
floor, and follow the maze of halls
to its utter end. The Owl office
will give you the book, after you
pay them.

achievement of students who have
acquired certain college dxper-
iences in non—traditional ways.

The College Level Examination
Program (CLEP) enables those

whose previous experience. pri-

vate reading. or non-college class-
room knowledge is equivalent to
college course work to be placed
at advanced levels. The program.
designed by-the College Entrance
Examination Board. ‘ includes
tests in five areas: English. the
humanities. natural sciences. so-
cial sciences. and mathematics.

Candidates’ scores are based
upon Pitt’s College of Arts and
Science norms, developed over a
period when all students complet-
ing their sophomore year were
required to take the examination.

Students who demonstrate
through the examination that they
have gained outside experience
and other non-classroom educa-
tion, comparable to a Pitt sopho-
more, will be permitted to pro-
ceed directly to study in a major
field of interest.

The student would be credited
for and exempted from the reg—'

ROME (AP) — Italian officials
are expressing growing concern
over the steady loss of the na-
- tion‘s art treasures to thieves.
They say 50.000 art works valued
at $400 million have been stolen
in the last 30 years. some of them
finding their way to other lands.
‘‘It‘s a disaster." says a spokes-
man for the "Bureau of Antiquites

Public Instruction. charged with
guarding art and archeological ob-
jects. claims: “In every case the
operation of an international net-
work of clandestine operators is
evident."

In one current case in Rome, na-
tionalpolice are probing to see is a
23,500-year-old Greek vase, pur-
chased by the New York Metro-
politan Museum of Art, was dug
up from Etruscan tombs near

Remember
  Rutgers

by RONFSVIEGEL
Willis Cardot has quit the Pitt basketball team.

You may have to think a moment before you recognize the
name. If you leave basketball games early, you’ll have to- think
even longer." Willis Cardot hasn’t seen much 'action recently.
Outside of a last minute entry, he hasn’t seen any playing time.

But think back to Dec. 4, when a highly rated Rutgers squad
came to the Pitt Field House. Billy Knight, Pitt’s “mister bas-
ketball” got into foul trouble early in the game. The man the
‘team relied upon to lead them was gone. Off the bench to the

rescue came Cardot.

This same Cardot, who had sat on the bench for most o-f the
_ first two games, and who had not been mentioned in pre-season

there.‘

Cardot won that game by doing what he had
shown he could all of last season, quarterback-
ing the team throughout the game, making
great passes and hitting on clutch free throws.
His free throw shooting was so good that when  
taken out for abreather at the time a‘ technical

    

C.A‘R DOT

, -Cioul was called on Rutgers, coach Buzz Ridl put him right back
‘-«. in ‘to shoot the technical.

Cardot never missed a foul shot all season. He only took
eight of them, but you can’t knock perfection. His foul shooting
was also superb last season, when he came to Pitt on a one-year
scholarship and won the rest of it by leading the freshmen team

cu

in scoring.

Ridl had nothing but praise for him after the game. “I knew
Willis could do the job,” he said. “I.w-atched him do it with the

frosh last year. ‘

But Cardot ended up doing the watching. Although he did
start the next game (the Steel Bowl), he was yanked quite early
andunever got a decent chance since. ,

There are several reasons why -this happened. In the South-

ern Illinois Steel Bowl consolation game, Cardot "was scrapping
for a loose ,,,ball on the Civic Arena floor when a bumbling

_[.{eferee stepped on his left hand, his shooting hand.

The recovery for Cardot was not speedy, and when he re-
turned to action, freshmen Tom Richards and Keith Starr had
proven that they alsobelonged on’ the varsity. A bout with the
flu further’ delayed his return to playing condition. He missed
games during this time that definitely would have had him see-
ing action. In the Notre Dame game which Pitt loss in overtime
after leading all game, Ridl admitted that Willis would‘ have
helped. “Willis always makes the right decision,” he said. “Our
boys tried to make the right play, but they didn’t.”

Finally Cardot was ready to play, but found himself play-
ing only in practice, and not so much even then. The need for a
ball-handling guard who could shoot foul shots well came up
many times, but he rarely got thd call from Ridl. ‘

, Cardot volunteered to play jayvee ball and showed his form,
perhaps’at his best when he scored 24 against Clarion. He finally
got disgusted with being put in games in the closing moments
and last week left the team and the school, transfering to Mer-

_ceyhurst College. His basketball future is uncertain, but re-

”" ' membering the Rutgers game, I can’t blame him for leaving.

At Eastern Title Win

Wednesday, February 28, l973—THE PITT NEWS—Page 9 I I

Tritch Not Surprised  

by BILL PROUDFOOT

If Bruno Sammartino ambled
on down Fifth Ave., you could bet
your pinball money that the back
slapping mob he’d draw would
rate a parade permit. The champ.
right? .

Now. if Craig Tritch bopped his
190 pound frame down the same
street, any Oakland inhabitant in-
formed of the fact would probably
blink twice and counter. "Greg
who?"

Somehow, 190 pound Eastern In-
collegiate Wrestling champions
are not familar faces in the city
that boos George Steele on sight.
or squeals in delight over Johnny
DeFazio’s rippling shoulders.
Craig Tritch, reciepient of said
Eastern crown over the weekend,
remains as anonymous today as

-last week when he was Pitt’s 190- . _;
‘pounder. '

“College wrestling isn’t so big
here, I don’t have people coming
up and aren't you Craig Tritch,
the guy who took Easterns?”

Nonetheless, the articulate sen-
ior was Pitt’s only winner in the
recent tourney, which included
powerhouses like Penn Stateand

Navy. And Tritch is very happy

about the accomplishment.

“I’m glad I won the Easterns,”
he said, eyes twinkling. “You
know, my wife would sit up in the
stands during’ our matches and
hear people moan when I came on
the mat. ‘He’s a bum,,‘. what’s
Adams going with him for?’

R they’d say. Well,lI won and Iguess

I showed everybody who thought I
was a bum.

All during the season Craig was
Pitt’s “other” senior, behind the
scrappy Jay Buzzato. He was the
guy who had the lousy start and
had to win his lat five bouts to fin-
ish 7-4. He was almost bounced
from the team on one occasion.

“I had a bad attitude, I guess
you could say, at the beginning of
the year. I figured I was a senior
and that I was too good to be told
anything. I was maybe 70 per
cent effective.”

. At one miserable point in the
season, Tritch was nearly bench-
ed for good by Coach Dave Adams.

“I’ve changed pretty much since
then. I appreciate the fact that
Coach Adams stuck with me,”
said the Lower Dauphin High
School star." .

Consequently, Craig Tritch is
also the guy, maybe the only one,
who wasn’t surprised when he
took the 190 pound title.

“No,‘I wasn’t surprised,“ he

CRAIG TRITCH was behind 2-0 when he scored this near fall over Jeff Sip-’
mons of Navy. The move proved to be the deciding factor of the match,’

and the win gave him the T90-pound title.

said with a steady eye, “I felt that
I could beat anyone in the tourna-
ment. But you’re never sure.
though. On a given day a bum can
knock off the top man.” I

To get to the championship, the
senior from‘ Middletown, Pa.,
didn’t beat any chumps. Among
his victims were the number five
seeded .man, Neal Brendel; the
second seeded, Jeff Simons of
Navy, and the guy rated tops in
the division, Richie Starr of Har-
vard.

Tritch nipped Simons in the fin-
al round of the tourney. reversing
an earlier 7-4 dual loss to the Mid-
shipman. The bout was awarded
to Criag on a majority decision
after the pair had drawn 4-4 in
regulation and "overtime.

* "Coach Adams told me the two
judges-voted for me and the ref-
eree went for Simons for his
movement,” Tritch said, welcom-
ing no doubt, theverdict which
he’d apparently locked up before
being reversed with seven sec-
onds to go. _“I guess. he did have it
won on movement, but I nearly
pinned him, so they gave it to me.

The mental strain of the tour-
nament provided a pressure al-

most greater than the physical _

beating, according to Pitt’s new
champ. The tension incrased as
the matches advanced, until the
complete concentration rendered
the nerves raw.

  Because Of   ‘°"Major” Changes

by BART MACK
“If Johnny Majors wasn’t the

coach, I wouldn’t be going to .

g;;m.*‘

 ‘K’ Those are the words of Anthony
 Dorsett, the biggest “name” run-

ning back to come out of Western
Pennsylvania, first team Parade
All-American, Coach and Athletic
All-American, Scholastic Maga-
zine All-American, and, .most im-
portant, the number one recruit
for the 1973 Pitt football team.

Just why has the number one
high school running back in the
nation chose. to come to Pitt, a tra-
ditional loser on the gridiron for
the last nine years? The answer is
Johnny Majors, the coach, the
man.‘ A

3 “Ireally dug the way he (Ma-
. _ V E ’

jors) talks,” Dorsett grinned.
“He has all the confidence in the

-world. He’s a winner and that’s

half the battle right there.”

That sweet talking Southern ac-
cent that Majors uses so effec-
tively has put Pitt at the top of
the recruiting war. Dorsett was
chased by every major football
power in the nation. Dorsett per-
sonally visited Ohio State, Penn
State, Minnesota, Purdue, West
Virginia, and Pitt before inking a
letter of intent that has been put

‘ on file at the Cathedral of Learn-

mg.

Dorsett was also contacted by
Colorado, Michigan State, Notre
Dame, Miami,of Florida,’ and

' Oklahoma just to name a fe'w._In .-

fact, the head coaches from Colo-
rado, Oklahoma, and Ohio State
paid Dorsett a. visit after the
speedster had,'signed the letter
of intent, but, according to Dor-
set, he “just gave them the word."

Majors’ assistant head coach,
Jack Sherrill, calls Dorsett “the
most complete high school foot-
ball player I've ever seen.” And
it’s no wonder. Dorsett rushed for
1,034 yards and 10 touchdowns as
a junior at Hopewell High and 1,-
238 yards and 23 TDs as a senior.
He started as a sophomore on de-
fense as “munster” man.

It wasn’t long before Hopewell
coaches Butch Ross and Ralph
Veights recognized his.true tal-
ents and made him a regular in

the backfield, At» 5-llgjand 180 '

pounds, Dorsett runs the 40 in 4.5
seconds. 4

Another reason influential in
Dorsett’s choice of Pitt was the
fact that he wanted to remain in
the the near vicinity. -

“Pitt’s close to home,” Dorsett
remarked. “Everyone wants to
see me play in the area, especial-
ly my mother.” '

Dorsett expressed his confi-
dence in Majors and the newly
baptized Pitt football program
when he said, “I‘d say two years
at the most. Even next year a lot
of people are going to be sur-
prised.

“As far as I’m concerned. I
think_ I‘ve got a good chance to
start. If I don’t have any injuries,
I'll be out there.” -  —

.3’.

“I’ve never gone through more 
reflected a ,— j

mental torment,”
much relieved.Tritch. “You don't,

know what is going to happen to :_

you when you walk onto the mat.

All two days I kept telling myself,  

‘I'll sit out on him, or I’l ride him." ’,

Hungry N ittany Lions
Maul Pink Panthers

Last Tuesday night the Pitt
women gymnasts faced their third
season disappointment as they
were downed at University Park
by the Penn State team. 78.60-
66.40. ‘

Of the top 12 places in the four
events. Penn State ran away with
10. leaving only two for the Pink
Panthers. These two went to Don-
na De Marino who placed second
on the balance beam with a 5.95.
and first in floor exercise with a
7.10. i ' '

Other Pink Panthers came close
to placing. One was Anne Mona- .
han who scored 6.40 on a layout
squat vault which came in fourth.
Below"Monahan was teammate
Kathy Krynock who vaulted a
6.15.

Again, on beam, Monahan miss-
ed third place by two-tenths of a
point, scoring 6.50. Teammate
Anna Krupa came in fourth on the
uneven parallel bars with a 4.90,
quite a bit below the third place
score of 5.85.

The highest score of the entire
meet was 7.80 which belonged to
Penn State's Debby Renton for
her vault. Most of the scores
were in the six-point range. and
three scores in the five-point
range took places. This indicates
the stringent level of judging ex-
ercised at the meet. ,

Pitt’s Coach Gail DiCicco com-
mented. "One of the four judges
was Ernestine Weaver, an inter-
national gymnastics judge. Her

standards were of the level used
to judge someone like Kathy Rig-
by. She constantly scored about
one point lower than is usual in
collegiate judging.”

In scoring gymnastics, the high-
est and lowest scores are dropped
so that Weaver's calculations of-
ten did not figure in the final
score.

DiCicco said. “It was a bad day,
our worst meet so far in terms of
the whole team. It just wasn't a
team effort.”

In reflecting on the reasons be-
hind her team‘s poor perform-
ance. DiCicco said, "The area
used for the meet was unbeliev-
ably overcrowded. The pieces of
apparatus were situated very
close together. In fact, one girl
actually walked across the path
of one of my girls as she was run-
ning to vault.

“This claustrophobic atmos-
phere showed ‘its effects most
clearly in the vaulting event. Since
there is a running approach in-
volved, the vaulter needs enough
room so that she doesn’t feel con-
fined during the vault. The space
problem had disasterous effects
on our vaulting. We experienced
the same sort of cramped condi-
tions at -our Temple meet and it
had the same effects?’ 1’

by BART MACK

With only two regular season
games remaining. the Pitt Hock-
ey Club, can clinch first place of
the City Division of the Western
Pennsylvania Intercollegiate
Hockey Association with a win
over Carnegie-Mellon Sunday
night at the Alpine Ice Chalet.

That‘s easier said that done.
however. as Pitt has dropped a
pair of contests to the Tartans so
far this year. The skaters went

~ down 4-3 back in December. for

Pitt‘s first loss to a league oppon-
ent in a year and a half, and most
recently bowed to C-MU, 3-1. in
the West Penn Hockey Tourna-
ment at the Civic Arena.

Pitt is cu_rrently in sole posses-
sion of the City Division lead.
thanks to the efforts of Metropoli-
tan Division winners Indiana.

Wednesday, February 28, 1973 —THE PITT NEWS—Page ll

  Skaters Meet C-MU For City Title

Carnegie—l\/Iellon lost to Indiana.
3-2. last Sunday night at the Al-
pine. That loss was the first of the
season for the Tartans. bringing
their record to 9-1-2. for a total of
20 points.

Pitt, meanwhile, stands at 11-1,
for 22 points. Both teams have a
game remaining after their meet-
ing on Sunday, but a Pitt ‘victory

would give the ieers the top spot,

regardless of the outcome of
those two games.

The Pitt skaters have under-
gone a drastic change in the last
week. accepting the resignations
of Tom Myers and Gu_y Carole as
coaches of the team. John’ Finney.

Sr. has been ‘named as the new‘

head coach, and Leonard "Red“
Kelly, former coach of the Pitts-
burgh Penguins, will join the team
in the capacity of an "assistant
coachf’

Kelly plans to attend all the
games and practice sessions that
he can. but speaking engagements
in Canada will take the former
Toronto Maple Leaf Hall of Fam-
er out of town. thus it would be im-
possible for him to assume head
coaching responsibilities.

Pitt will have to juggle their
lines in order to come up with a
balanced attack to face the Tar-
tans. Dave Bahnson, formerly the
second line center, has hung up
his skates and will miss the re-
mainder of the season. Joe Testa
will probably move up from the
third line to fill the ‘vacancy.

The skaters will face another  "

bruising contest in the season fin-
ale. as the Duquesne Dukes will‘
provide a worthwhile prep for the
playoffs.
