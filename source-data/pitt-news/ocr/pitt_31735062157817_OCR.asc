I-F Council a11d its slate has won again.
But not before the Coalition that_opposed them took two
senior Student Congress seats and gave them the closest ﬁght

in seven years.

Bitterness of the battle attracted the largest. turnout

of electors in the past decade.

The two seniors, Bob McKowen a.nd Lou Cecconi, were-

the ﬁrst non-fraternity men elected without frat support in
recent years. Cccconi received the highest number of ballots

‘of any one ca.ndidate..

Outside of ‘these two, IF’s full slate for Student Con-
gress and Men’s Council came in ahead. They were‘: Seniors
Bill Swanson and Dick Campbell and Juniors Howard
Greenberger, Ray Maher, Dave Gleland, and Don Murray.
Gleland topped the junior men in votes gathered. '

Both amendments proposed for adoption passed with votes

to spare. ~

Murray, an Ellsworth Centerite,

ran on the IF slate, renamed

poses of the election,

The _n:«'‘ slate was trimphant
all down the line in the Men’s
Council contests. The Coali-
tion did not even attempt any
serious contesting for Council
seats.

Turnout for the election was the
heaviest in recent years. It to-
taled at‘ least 100. per cent great-

Roving groups of fraternity men

stole 1100 copies of the Pitt News
last Tuesday but failed to stop

The greek boys stole some 400
copies from the Engineering halls
and another 700 from Ellsworth
Center. They were prevented
'from..seizing more. than. a.. few
copies from the Cathedral. .

Word that the theft would be
attempted ‘was widespread on
Tuesday morning. The original
plan called for taking the entire
edition when it_ arrjved at the
basement platform. A

As, an alternate scheme several

frat men were stationed around

 

the Student Desk. They were un-
der orders to grab large numbers
of papers when they were put in
the circulation boxes. I ‘

The ﬁrst plan was halted by the
appearance of Paul Lohmeyer,
publications advisor, at the plat-
form. And at the Student Desk
members of the News staff handed
out copies to prevent any pilfer-
ing. '

Ellsworth Center and Engineer-
ing officials were not alerted in
time to prevent loss of all papers
‘sent to those two places. Within
a few minutes the papers were
replaced.-. 4

Why the papers were stolen

 

could not be learned. ,Best guess‘
advanced was that the frats feared
the -News would disclose the fact
that the IF slate was running un-
der the name ’of the “Al1—Student
Party.”

Fraternity officials denied that
the plan was ordered or instigated
by IF Council and most of them
condemned the action. They
blamed a group of hotheads among
the greeks. Only one IF Council
member was known to be among
the group who tried to grab the
papers on the Ground Floor.

At Wednesday night’s meeting
IF Council was reportedly con-
sidering what action they might

take against the frat’ men involved.

Job Pacemeni
Levelng Off 9

Evanston, Ill.—-—(I.P.)—The em-
ploy-ment of newly- graduated
college men by the nation’s large
corporations seems to have re_ach-
ed a leveling-oﬁ period, Frank S.
Endicott, director of Northwestern
University’s bureau of place-
ment, declared here recently.

The information was derived,
Dr. Endicott said, from asurvey,

«just completed, of the personnel

needs of 173 large companies. He
gave hisireport to a conference
of 100 personnel executives and
two score university and college
placement directors,_ meeting on
this campus.

Dr. Endicott explained that the
leveling-oﬁ in no way indicates
that the hiring of college gradu-
ates is falling off seriously. More
companies than ever before, es-

pecially the smaller concerns, now

are seeking college graduates for
their employee ranks, he said. Al-
though the companiesqueried in
the survey reported‘ a decrease in
the number of college graduates
to be employed this year, no sharp
drop. is indicated, Dr. Endicott
said.

There is a coninued strong de-
mand for engineers, ‘general bus-

iness trainees, and sales_ and ac-

counting personnel: In 1948, the
reporting companies hired ap-
proximately 10,00 new college
graduates. They already see a

need for this year of about 8,700.»

The rapid postwar increase in
the _hiring of graduates was at-
tributable to expansion programs
in business and industry, he said,
expansion which is now is fairly
complete. Current employment
needs are largely those attributa-
ble to replacement, he pointed out.

College Slore
Charges High

Laramie, Wyo. —— (I. P.) ——Are
college bookstore prices too high?
According to E. O. Fuller, man-
ager of the University of Wyom-
ing bookstore, “Textbooks are too
darned high. Students are being
hijacked—but we can do nothing.
We are forced to sell books at list
price. If we do not, the publish-
ers will not send the books to
us.”

One of the reasons why the
average college bookstore cannot
buy more second-hand books, .a
recent survey disclosed,’ is that
teachers sometimes‘ I require a
change of texts, without having
exercised enough care to see that
a change in the textbook is real-
ly necessary. Thus even though
the discarded edition and the new
edition are substantially the same,
the older edition has become dead
stock.

“Publishers have a racket,"
stated Fuller. “If they’ are going
to have a new printing, they get
the author to change one line so’

that the .old edition cannot be
used. ‘

“Exhibition A-—a new edition of
a history book came out exactly
the same as the old except for a
one-half page of outline map of
the United States. The teacher
refused to let‘the students buy

‘store had several copies, because,

“When I get before a class and
say, ‘Turn to page 17 to_ look at
the map, ‘it won’t be there and

.they’ll laugh at me.’ ”

Sense-Les

By LES GALLAGHER

Well, the most bitterly contested
student election ever waged across
the street from the PAA and the
Masonic Temple is over- It was a
crash and mangle, come—in—with
your-cleats—high affair, with no
holds barred and women and chil-
dren ﬁrst. It went nip and tuck
to the wire with the frat party us-
ing just about every ﬁlthy trick in
the book.

The frats did everything but
stuff the ballot boxes and pay the
vote counters. I only say they did
not do;this because I have no
proof that they did. But consid-
ering the rest of their underhand-
sidearm deliveries, you could
hardly put it past them. They
were swinging’ for the tall and
uncut and they made it. From my
grandstand seat they put about six
bush leaguers in the lineup and
loaded the bases with Men’s‘ Coun-
cil. -

The ﬁrst pitch started when
Boston Blackie curved a ‘twenty
buck rap around the necks of
any fraternity whose man ran
counter to signals. The next foul
ball that the frats threw was a
real sinker. It was the big plan
to kidnap the Pitt News.

°Plenfy Scared

The frats were plenty scared
they wouldn’t make it this time.
They were shakin’ like 21 Fail‘ Of
dice makin’ an eighter from De-
catur, the hard waY- The frats
knew that if they were to once
more climb» into the pen of bull
they would have to change the
names on their uniforms.

The poor, fraternity kids thought
that the_Pitt News was printing

information got out, until. just be-
fore election time,‘~. the frats knew
that they: wouldn’t be" able to

dependent voters, who .~ would

was the Independent ~Party sim-
ply because the standard name, IF
Slate,_was missing. ' K
This was the reasonfor the Pitt
New’s circulation dropping off by
about one thousand,-last issue.'It
seems that a little boy by the
name of Skip made off ,with. more

boy. Dear Skip, drop around to
theiNews Office and we’ll give_ you‘
a badge. This badge will entitle
you to get on the streetcars. and
that way you can make a real liv-
mg.

Last Wednesday, the day of the
election, I saw written on a num-
ber of blackboards, “Vote For The
All Student Party.” And directly
beneath this printed babbling was
the little quote, “oust the frat
boys.” This wasdirect misrepre-
sentation when all along the All
Student Party was the. frat boys.
This was about as low as ball four
when it comes to suckin’ in a few
crummy votes.

Dirfy Tacfics

These were the tactics: ﬁnes,
stealing and ‘misrepresentation, of
that grand and noble group of
boys, the fraternities, whose very
organizations preach grand and
noble tactics. Pledge’ me early
brother, I’m to be queen of the
May. A

So once again we have a student
government by the minority and
for the minority, as was so ably
stated by Art Ragan. And it was
only through the efforts of one,
Stu Workmaster, that the frats
didn’t sweep home plate. His Co-
alitionist’s scored twice.

Also, it is known that l slid
what little support I had to of-
fer Mr.‘Workmaster’s way, and I
know that this column will be la-
beled sorehead. But I quote a
little story. “Man O_’ War was a
great horse. He won 19'out of ‘20.
The race that he didn’t win, his
jockey purposely gave him a bad
ride. The trainer of Man O’ War
said, “I don’t mind his losin’, it’s
the way that he lost.’’ Nobody
minds losin’ a clean ﬁght. .

And so that’s it. The frats have
a great, organized ball club_. A few
managers said, “slide,” and they
slid. It looks like we’re in for

another season of Class “D” ball.

Lawrence lee
To Speak Here

, Lawrence Lee, who will Speak
at the Writers Conference on May
6, has edited pulp magazines, lit-
erary quarterlies, written novels
and translated ‘French biographies,

but he likes writing poetry best -
-of all-.

In a recent letter to Edwin H.
I associate professor of
English,‘ Mr. ‘Lee said.’ “I am
pleasedethat you are aware of my
poetry, which -I value.” - .
Mr. Lee, isnat present advisory
editor of -Julius" Messner, Inc.
He has‘ written more than a half

dozen books or poetry and some

short stories which appeared in
“The Virginia Quarterly Review,”
and “Best Short Stories of 1948.”

 .At the Friday, May ‘6 session of
the Writers‘ Conference Mr. Lee

will speak on ’“The Coming Re-
bellion in Art.” He will also give
a ﬁve minute talk, “What Might
Be Done WithlMagazine Writing.”

To young writers he gives the

-following advice, “There is an old

word, on which -I am now fixed in
fascination. It is the word ‘dedi-
cation.’ The earlier this can be

‘given without analysis, the sooner
we have a writer. The rest is de-
v tails- and hardly, matters.” ,

BUSINESS

EVERY PROGRESSIVE STATE is doing all it can to

‘ attract new industries . .

. for new industries are

good business for the state and for its citizens.

If Pennsylvania could attract a new industryvin

which nearly one out of

every 100 of its citizens‘

_would have a personal stake, either as an employee
or an investor,_what a great accomplishment that

would be.

And if the new industry were to pay these

people more than $100,0

00,000 in a single year,

‘what a great thing that would be for Pennsylvania
business and professional ‘men. I

And if the employees of the new industry
resided in cities and towns throughout the state,
_ what a boon that would be for local communities.

Andiif the new industry
which all citizens of the

were to provide a service
state would use, what a

vital industry that would be to everybody.

Pennsylvania already has an industry——not a
new one, either—that meets those speciﬁcations

to the letter.
It is -this companffand

it is growing every year.

In anybody's book, one of them
is hustling, strapping Charles H.
(Chuck) Percy. Said TIME early
this year:

Ever since he was an undergraduate

at the University of Chicago, Charles
H. Percy has been a young business-
man in.a hurry. To -work his way
through college (his banker father had
gone broke in the depression), Chuck
Percy ran a wholesale business supply-

s aﬁed-61:61 ‘zz nxdv ‘«<9P!1.i—SM3N mu aH.I.-il;ﬁf.

ing the university’s fraternities with _

food, coal, furniture and linen. He also

held two other jobs, and captained the -.

rough, tough water polo team. In the
summer vacation of 1937 he took a job
at $12 a week in Chicago’s Bell &
Howell Co. (cameras). For the next
11% years he was in & out of Bell &
Howell, but was seldom out I of the
mind of its president, Joe H. McNabb.

It was McNabb who persuaded
Chuck Percy to work for Bell& Howell
on weekends and vacations, and gave
him a full-time job when he graduated
from Chicago in 1941. He was put in
charge of a new department to handle

defense contracts. The contracts rolled I

in so fast that six months later, when
Percy was 21, he was in charge of the
major part of Bell 81 Howell’s business.
Just before he joined the Navy as a
seaman, McNabb made him assistant
secretary and a company director.

I New Theme. Stationed on theWest
Coast, Percy spent his spare time
studying West Coast industries and
the causes of strikes. His reports so
impressed McNabb that when Chuck
Percy was discharged (as lieutenant),
he became Bell & Howell’s industrial
relations and personnel director. '

CHUCK PERCY
The reports were impressive.

a

Percy began to streamline Bell ‘&
Howell’s management. In 18 months,
- he reduced the number of departments
from 189 to I30, hopes to bring them
down eventually to 88. _

New Boss. This week, Percy got the
go-ahead to ﬁnish the job—and in his
own way. To succeed McNabb, who
died last week, the directors chose him
president. At 29, he is boss of a com-
pany that sold $I8 million worth of

motion—picture cameras -and equip- .

ment last year, and earned a net ‘profit
 of some $2,3oo,ooo.

  Assembly Speaker May I8 ,

_ By BOB THOMAS _ V
“The Only One Of his kind,” is the reputation that precedes Ogden

' Nash to Pitt. ~

This man “to whom nothing is

sacred” will be the speaker at a

Student Congress sponsored assembly on May 18.

Ogden Nash has left a long lineﬁ

of pricked conventions and fallen
sentiments behind him since his.
birth in Rye, New York, in 1902.
;/In spite of his attitude on such
things he had illustrious ancestry
. to back him up. Tracing back far
enough, a revolutionary governor
of North Carolina was found on
his family tree; also~ a revolu-
tionary general who gave his name
to Nashville, Tennessee. .
As‘ for education, Nash lays
claim to a year at Harvard. He

‘ stoutly maintains documents are

in his possession _that show that
he departed on his own free will.’
Following the Harvard chapter he
.taught for a year at St. George’s
school in Newport, Rhode Island.
In typical Nashian manner he con-
denses this episodejin the state-
-ment ; that he “lost ‘an entire

. - ‘nervous system carving lamb for

a.table of fourteen—year-olds”.
' In the years following Nash
took a ﬂing at bond selling in
 New York and Worked for a time

’versity of Virginia. During the
Kwar he was a naval officer and
also gave a lecture on American
.Poetry at the University of Lon-

 don. He recently completed a

novel “The Nameless’ Are My
* Brothers” and has done many
book reviews for The New York

.Times Book Reviews.

Of him,'Mr. Peterson says, “He
is. probably a very practical and
versatile man as a writer and edi-
tor,‘ but he is also one of our dis-
tinguished poets.”

for Doubleday, Doran. He ﬁnally

"settled down to embrace a com-

paratively quiet existence on the
editorial staff of the New Yorker.

The Nash poem 1s_ a hand—man-. .

gled maze of jumping metre,

home-made rhyme, and "frantic ‘ ‘

verse form‘. Behind it, however,
lurks a pungent wit that has con-
sistently boosted his books onto
the best-seller list. A

Nash will climb onto the Pitt
lecture platform with another
reputation of liking to recite his
verses, both unpublished and,un-
publishable.

What to expect? Here’s a sam- .

For [M Gait Tennis Activity

Once again inadquate facilities will restrict the intramural pro-
gram here. ' ‘

Leo Bemis, IM director, has announced thatgolf and tennis. have
been added to the IM slate, “provided we get the" places to play.”
Allegheny Park in Northside, and near-by Schenley Park-' are
being sought forthe two sports} ‘

Run-off Undecided _

How the all-campus competi-
tion will be run off will be deter-
mined by the -number of men en-
tered, and by the facilities avail-
able. -

If enough fellows enter in the
golfing, . the ten best scores will
play another round to _determine
the winner. IF competition will
be'a.\double elimination. '

Tennis will be run off in.a sim-
ilar manner, _ with probably
straight" elimination for the all-
campus, and double elimination
again for the fraternities.

Weather Figures

Entering the situation also is
the weather. Right now Bemis is
being plagued by bad weather for
his softball program. He is cheer-
fully conﬁdent, though, that all
the IM 'sports will be-run off in
spite "of diﬁiculties. .

Trophies will‘ be given to the
all-campus winners in both sports,

A Ravenous

Appetite. Ours

By DONALD’ GIFFIN
Sports Editor

Pitt ﬁnally gets some elbow room for its athletes today,
when Ralph Mitterling’s baseballers move to Schenley Oval

for a clash with Thiel.

Since Tom Hamilton arrived here, the athletic appetite
has been ravenous. Like a bloated man pushing back from the

the table after storing away .13

hearty Sunday dinner, the Pan-
ther had to let out its belt a
notch.

The swollen stomach ploppedlon
the Oval.. ,

There’s still some pressure on
the waistband. More space is need-
ed to operate a varsity and intra-
mural program on the scale Ham-

ilton would like. The additional_

faci1ities.will help, not solve.
Must Buy Blocks

_ Until the University buys up
some block in the vicinity and
tears down the buildings on it,
the all-important space-for-sports
problem will plague the school.

The new athletic director recog-
nized th'e difiiculty his ﬁrst days
here. “The athletic problem at
present seems to be getting ﬁeld
space. As we get more facilities,
we’ll add to the varsity and in-
tramural programs,” he said.

Even without an expansion,
Hamilton has set up jayvee foot-
ball, and has plans for organizing
freshman supplements to varsity
sports and increasing the scope of
the intramurals.

Track, Baseball Conﬂict

He was disturbed over the
spring situation in ‘the Stadium,
where drilling squads’ of ‘track
men and baseballers intermingle
inside the saucer,

Recalling an unpleasant inci-

' dent at Annapolis, when a man

    
 

was struck and killed by a j_ave-

lin on a ﬁeld where the cinder
squad alone worked out, he sought
a new diamond for the baseball-
ers, selected for ousting, from the
Stadium.

He pushed Pitt’s foot into the
Oval, but just a week ago, before
the diamondmen could move over,
Hamilton’s fears ,were borne out.
Outﬁelder Johnny Finfrock was
beaned by a stray discus.

Luckily No Tragedy?

The results, fortunately, weren’t
as tragic as the accident at Navy,
but Finfrock will likely be un-
easy around any discus throwers
except the Greek one in Carnegie
Museum. ‘

With the assistance of Pittsburgh
park employees, Pitt’s workmen

-have labored over the Schenley

diamond, so it will match the
smooth Stadium grass. It already
removes the "short right ﬁeld dif-
ﬁculty.

Its bad location with regard to
the campus will be "counteracted
by a regular University bus serv-
ice. '

Oval for Football?

Hamilton is looking beyond
baseball and softball at the Oval.
He ;may arrange for its use for
freshman football ‘next fall.

All this is a set-up_ for para-
phrasing the University's progress
slogan, “The University is tmoving
ahead.” , '

The University is spreading out.

Pitt Schedules
Duke for Two
Grid Contests

Intersectional contests seem to
be the order of the day for the
1950 Panther gridders.

Duke University, ﬁfth foe an-
nounced for next year, will open
the Pitt season with a game in the
Stadium on September 30.

Previously carded were games
with Miami of Florida, Rice,
Northwestern, and Ohio State.

Duke in ’51, Too

A second game with the Duke
Blue Devils has been scheduled
for September 29. 1951. but the
site of that game has not yet
been decided.

The renewal of the Pitt-Duke
rivalry, interrupted by the war in
1943, was announced by Athletic
Directors Eddie Cameron of Duke
and Tom Hamilton of Pitt.

Duke Holds Series Lead_

Duke holds a ﬁve to three ad-
vantage in the eight games played
in the series. Under Jock Suther-
land, the Panthers walloped the
Blue Devils in 1929, 52-7, and beat
them again, 10-0, in 1937. . I

In 1938, Duke blasted Pitt’s
Rose Bowl hopes with an upset
7-0 victory on a snow-covered
gridiron. ‘ ‘

when Charley. Bowser’s eleven
stopped the famed George Mc-
Afee to win, 14-13. .

Pitt dropped the last three con-
tests"to the ,Blue Devils, bowing

0 in 1942.

Mittmen Seek
Third Victory i

Just plain rookie was the type
of win Ralph Mitterling’s mitt-
men scored over Juniata at Hunt-
ingdon Wednesday, 17-5, and new
faces will again grace the start-
ing lineup when the Panthers

take on the Theil Tomcats at
Schenley Oval today‘ and Bethany
tomorrow.

Free bus service for today’s
baseball spectators will be in
operation. Starting at one
o’clock the bus will leave the
Stadium every half hour until
3:30, stopping brieﬂy at the
Cathedral's Bigelow Blvd. en-
trance before going on to the
Schenley Oval- Gametime is
3:30. Tomori-ow’s game starts
at 2:00, but there will be no
bus service for that game.

Eight new men were responsi-
ble for 15 of the 18 hits regis-
tered off Paul Peoples as Pitt
pounced on the righthander for
12 runs in the ﬁrst three innings.
Rudy Hudec ‘ ‘went the distance
for . Mitterling’s crew to record
his first win of the season and
Pitt’s second "against no losses.

Roger (my name is Smodic) Mc-
Gill took- Mitterling’s mind off
the loss of Art Barnes by banging
out three hits, including a triple
in the ﬁrst inning. _ '

Rightﬁelder Sam Shapiro, the
bomber from Brownsville, showed
the Sarge his appreciation for a
starting role by slamming out four
hits, driving in four runs and
scoring two. Joe Ross, another
newcomer, tripled in his only ap-
pearance at the plate. .

The Juniata win was a special
satisﬁer for Big Rudy, who pitch,-
ed the main portion of last year’s
game against the Indians but lost
to Peoples in the 15th inning, 3-2.

Dr. Will Grant Chambers, 81, founder and ﬁrst dean of the School 3

of Education at Pitt, died Sunday at his home in State College.

“He was a powerful inﬂuence for modernizing education in
Western Pennsylvania,” according to W. D. Sones, professor of edu-
cation at the University. Dr. Sones is the only remaining member of
the faculty who taught here when Dr. Chambers was at Pitt.

Dr. Chambers came to Pitt as a professor of education in 1909.

The next year he organized that¢

department into a separate school
and become its ﬁrst dean.

He remained as dean until 1921
when he joined the faculty of
Penn State as a professor. In 1923
he became dean of the School of
Education at Penn State.

While at Pitt Dr. Chambers fa-
vored the policy of bringing na-
tionally known educators here for
the beneﬁt of both the students
and the public. -

In association with Dr. Charles

B. Robertson he organized the ex-
tension division under which stu-
dent teachers receive part of their
training off the campus at various
local schools.

Dr. Chambers began his 50-year
career as a teacher in 1887. Dur-
ing his life time he taught in the
Mt. Pleasant Public Schools; at
Lock Haven, Indiana,.Pa.; and in
Minnesota and Colorado besides
his distinguished careers at Pitt
and Penn State.

’4-9-'50 Budget

The Student Congress 1949-50
submitted by
Treasurer Bob Kingsley and _ap-

proved Monday, calls for $2300 to-

be placed at the legislators’ dis-
posal.

Kingsley’s 1948-49 budget re-
port shows an expenditure of
$2150.

One of the biggest items on both
this year’s budget and the pro-
posed budget submitted at the
same time was “miscellaneous.”
This division accounted ‘for $350
this year andlis slated to absorb
$300 next year.

The new Poll Committee spent
$25 in its initial year and Kings-
ley estimated $100 will sufﬁce for
\next year’s polling business.

Speaker’s'fees were "$600 ‘dur-
ing 1948-49. This has been cut to
$350 for next year, Elections cost
$100 and have been raised to $150
next year.
