Criminal records plague job-seekers

by Halyse Domencic
Staff Write}:

Before-going crazy at that keg
party on Saturday night, you, might
want to think about how it could

affect your future employment. *

What was considered an exciting
idea at the time. might hurt your
chances of ﬁnding a job.

- Underage drinking citations,
open container violations, noise
violations, possession of afalse
identiﬁcation and_ vandalism are

all typical college mischief They

_

are also a part-of your criminal
background, I and many employ-

ers consider dlem when they’re »

reviewing applications. Therefore,
students are advised to be wary of
any blemishes on their records.

f‘There is no one vast set of
rules to go by,” said Barbara]ulius—
sen, associate director and career
counselor at Pitt’s Career Service
Center. “Employers have stepped
up on background checks.-What
one employer will accept, another
won’t.”

According to Pitt law profes-

SfrUl)EN'1"s STAN DU? FOR DARFUR

sor John Burkofﬁ it’s not unusual
for an ‘employer to consider any
offenses when hiring an appli-
cant.

“It doesn’t mean that if you
have a record you won’t get hired,
but it is legitimate for an employer
to consider it,” said Burkoff.

Whether or not the applicant
is eligible for a job depends on
many factors, including the con-
text of the- offense and how long
ago it was committed.

“There’s a big difference be-
tween possession of alcohol and

.sale_ of narcotics and a DUI,

which is far more serious than just
having a fake ID,” said Burkoff. ,
Both Burkoff and Juliussen
recommend that students be
open about their records rather

' than defending them. Repercus-
sions exist, particularly in federal '

government jobs and education.

While employers don’t always
have policies against these offens-
es,’ they are legal, and employees
are often required to go through:
the necessary background checks
to obtain their positions. ’ '

for drink tax

The Commonwealth Court
upheld the decision by a lower
courtwto deny two ‘proposed ref-

tax from appearing on the ballot. ~

I , The Friends Against Counter-
productive Taxation, a group of
bar and restaurant owners who
oppose the‘ county’s 10 percent
drink tax, amassed about 45,000
signatures on a petition to have
a referendum item appear on the

Allegheny County election bal— ~

proposed lowering the drink tax
to half a percentage point.

The lower court ruled that the

A referendum was not legal, be-

cause _taxes cannot be removed

“It was turneddown because

I the Commonwealth Court was
_relying on language contained

in the Home Rule Charter and

interpreted as saying only a legis-
lative body can adjust the rate of

chief secretary of FACT.

FACT contests that the provi-
sion doesn’t apply to every type
of taxation. I

“[The provision], only ap-
plies to taxation that is on the

Alumnus talks of

For T be Pitt New

International corporations

Pitt alumnus, and \Y/al—Mart is

Scott E. McHugh, a Pitt alum_- T

Corp., told students in Alumni

Wal-Mart is working with other ‘

major corporations, the Depart-

The regulations were also cre-
ated to prevent terrorist opera-
tions, said McHugh.

These requirements are often
very speciﬁc to the corporation.
As a result, factories around the
globe _ must adhere to multiple
sets of security requirements. It
can cost about $2,500 per corpo-
ration to do so.

The cost can add up quickly.
Wal-Mart, for example, has more
than 65,000 suppliers in 15 differ-
ent countries.

’ ‘‘We’ve been relatively lucky
in Pittsburg ,” said Thompson.
“[Compared to] anywhere from
Lancaster to Philadelphia, .we don’t
see nearly what they see.”

Gangs tend to form because their
members want power, status, love or
money, said Thompson. The gang
might seem to provide security and
a sense of family. .

But being in a gang generally
means getting involved with drug-

trafﬁcking, gun-dealing, drive-by

shootings, armed robbery and
burglaries, carjackings and murder.
They want to produce fear in their
communities, said Thompson.
Many of the Pittsburgh street
gangs are based on the Ciips and the
Bloods, two rival gangs that formed
in Los Angeles in the 19605 and
19705. Thompson said that in Pitts-
burgh, 18 gangs are Ciips, nine are
Bloods and 17 are independent.
These local versions are not as

organized as these national gangs

rooted in Chicago, New York City‘

and Los Angeles, according to a
February article by the Pittsburgh
Tribune—Review. Thompson said
that in Pittsburgh, the shootings
seen on the news tend to revolve
around issues with girlfriends and
bad drug deals. They are not as turf-

‘ifelated as in bigger cities.

There are no documented all-
female or Hispanic gangs in Pitts-
burgh, "said Thompson. Typically,
women are involved in gangs as “as—
sociates,” who generally have a clean
record and may provide housing or
other amenities for gang members.

Currently, there are no recorded
street gangs in Oakland. The South
Oakland Ciips were suspected to
be the cause of shootings and bank
robberies as recently as 2005. How-
ever, Thompson said that most of
these gang members either died or
went to  '

Thompson said it’s possible that
relatives and friends of the group
could resurface in South Oakland.

of clothing, colors, tattoos and graf-
ﬁti to identify themselves.

Most graffiti, Thompson said,
is not gang-related. “Piece” grafﬁti,
elaborate works of art or simple tags
of a name in cursive, are not neces-
sarily gang related.

Gang grafﬁti will generally be
used as communication. It may have
numbers, an address or symbols
with it It may commemorate a dead
gang member by saying “G.I.P.,” or
Gangster In Peace, or “C.I.P.,” Ciips
In Peace. If the member belongs to
the Crips or Bloods, they may cross
out certain letters or use numbers
in their place, because they do not
want to use letters that are in the
names of their rivals.

Thompson said gang—related graf-
ﬁti often shows up within boundar-

r ies of a gang’sturf, shortly before

criminal activity occurs‘in the area.
It can be used to put a contract on
a member ‘of another gang or chal-
lenge rivals. T
Bandanas and sportswear can
translate into a powerﬁil symbol

for a gang member. Often, when-

the gang gets together or commits
a crime, they will show their colors
to let other gangs know who they

angs form for money, love

are. They may wear a red bandana in

their back pocket, or a certain sports
teams jersey if it shares their colors
or letters in their name. .»

_Of course, not all people who
have red bandanas or wear ijer-'
seys are necessarily gang members.
Thompson said the best ways to
identify gangs is for community
members to report suspicious activ-
ity or to hold block watches.

‘°That’s how we do it,” said
Thompson. “It’s partly. the police
and partly the community.”

Thompson said. the system de-
pends on two—way communication.
People with a tip or questions on
gangs or suspicious activity  call

‘the police for feedback.

“Trusting your instincts, doing
something and telling someone”
can prevent crime and terrorism,
said Thompson. “You guys may
know your neighborhoods better
thanwe do.” T I

“It would be foolish fora law ﬁrm to
cut everyone out with underage drinking

did, half the people already in the law firm ’
would have never been hired.” '

' The consequences of an offense are pri-

one is applying for. ' _‘

Pittsburgh Public Schools, for example,
require Act 33/34 Clearances -and FBI

Latess explained that employing appli-

Attack ads, smears take

With less- than a month left

 until Election Day, the presiden-
j tial campaign seems to be getting
i nastier every day, as the candidates
0 ﬁght each other with low blows.

Both sides are guilty of resort-

‘ ing to shameful exaggerations
, and misleading comments in an

effort to gain points in the polls

0 and ultimately win the election in

November.
just last month, Sen. John Mc-
Cain’s campaign ran a television ad

: claiming that Sen. Barack Obama

supported “comprehensive” sex
education for kindergarteners.

- The reality, however, was that
; Obama actually supported a bill
_ that would have taught kindergar-

teners about sexual predators and

improper touching. When asked

‘ by a voter how he would respond

to McCain’s ad, Obama said, ac-
cording to The New York Times,

0 “I just have a different philoso-

phy. I’m going to respond with

A the truth.”

But while Obama vowed not
to stoop down to McCain’s level
by twisting the facts, the sena-

' tor shamelessly released a radio

ad last month criticizing McCain
for getting in the way of federal
ﬁnancing for stem cell research.
The truth is that, while'McCain
used to oppose federal support of
stem cell research, he later went
against President George W Bush
in 2001 to consistently support it.

The McCain campaign also

_ rooted through Obama’s personal

past and, just in time for Hallow-
een, found the skeletons hidden
in his closet. g
In a speech to GOP donors
in Englewood, Colo.,' this past

A weekend, Republican Vice presi-
A dential candidate Gov. Sarah Pa-

lin accused Obama of “palling

, around with terrorists,” referring

 focus away from real issues t 

to Obama’s connections with for—  
mer anti—war radical William Ay- ; 

ers, who founded an FBI-deemed

domestic terrorist group known ; 

as Weather Underground.
In truth, however, according
to CNN’s Fact Check, Ayers and

Obama lived in the same Chi— M 

cago neighborhood in the 1990s,

and beginning in 1995, they both 0 

worked on a school improvement

project with the non—proﬁt Chica- ' i

go Annenberg Challenge. That’s
as far as the relationship went.
Unfortunately, in the United

States, this is politics as usual. The V 
goal is to try and sway as many . 
undecided voters as possible, es- 0 V

pecially in swing states, which
usually end up deciding the elec-
tion.

While attack ads can some-
times help point out issues that
normally go unnoticed in the gen-
eral campaign, they tend to cross
the line, degrading the candidates
and the campaigns.

Most attacks and smears fail to

focus on the important issues af- l

fecting the United States. In turn,
voters might become inﬂuenced
to support a candidate based
upon unimportant spin rather
than facts.

It’s all a game, each side ea-
ger to bring the other one down.
Chris Lehane, a Democradc strat-
egist and former press secretary
to vice president Al Gore, said,
according to the Times, “All’s fair
in love, war and politics.”

So while the rules of this polit-
ical game don’t seem to be chang-
ing anytime soon, we, as voters,
can take the initiative to make an
educated choice on Nov. 4. Only
when we research the facts and

question the attacks can we make A

a well—informed decision at the
polling booths. V

Get a scapegoat, lose the blame

, I’ve recently decided to pur-
chase several thousand scapegoats.
I ﬁgure this is a smart investment.
The buying price was low —- just

to do during unfortunate times —
and realized that you only had the
old Clinton model? Cripes! You
forgot to upgrade to the new Bush
2000! .

Now everyone else is out and
about town with their trendy Bush

blaming someone for one thing or
another.

Right now, for example, politi-
cal pundits are really into buying a
new model of scapegoat known
as the “Wasillanator.” This recently
discovered Alaskan scapegoat is
known for its excessive winking

about half my soul —— and the
demand is way up, because
scapegoats are so in right now.
Scapegoats come in a lot
of different shapes, sizes and
colors. It’s important to have a
variety in stock at all times, be-
cause you just never know who
you might need to blame your
own mistakes and problems on.
I myself have all sorts, anything
from T—Mobile to Hillman Li-
brary. I even have an O]. Sirnp—
son scapegoat that often comes
in handy during poker games.
One of the keys to success-
ful scapegoat usage is to always

and can always be identiﬁed by
a raised dome of hair on the
top its head, like the top of an
ice cream cone. (Warning: This
model of scapegoat is known
to shoot other scapegoats with
its hunting rifle. It is not advis-
able to store within 500 yards
of your other scapegoats, or
anything, actually).

For the most part, Repub-
licans have been bulk buying,
but not using, Wasillanators, just
in case it ever does something

" goat trends. This is very important
, because just like in fashion, food,

music and art, if you don’t have the
hippest scapegoat .on the block, you
probably won’t have any friends.
For instance, what would have
happened if after Wall Street col-
lapsed you started looking through

20003, complaining about deregula-
tion and feeling mighty jolly about

themselves, while you are busy talk-
ing about Clinton’s healthcare poli-

part used to recall Supreme Court

prefer the Iraq War Unlike the
Wasillanators, the Iraq War scape-
goat is in constant use. Whether
it be global warming, the state of

our economy, foreign relations, cell_

phone reception or rainy weather,
Democrats will ﬁnd a way to blame
any problem on the Iraq War.
This is where they get the phrase,
“beating a dead ' goat with a stick.”
While we can’t be certain, it’s

speculated that Democrats in Con-
gress bought a surplus of Iraq War
scapegoats and — never wanting to
waste tax payers’ money — are des-
perately  to use them all up in
any way they can, because, frankly,
Democrats are anxious to blame
things on Sarah Palin, too.
‘Scapegoats are also popular in
the international market, where
——- just like in the meat industry —

the most popular scapegoat is the
largest and fattest one around: the
United States, naturally.

It’s also noteworthy to say that
while many scapegoats come and
go, there are some that just never
go out of style. Florida is a great
example. Most people I know have
or have had a Florida scapegoat,
cheeky little  I myself prefer
the Ohio scapegoat, because Ohio

is pointless, and at least Florida has
delicious oranges and Walt Disney
World.

Parents are another great time-
less scapegoat. This is because, un-
like Ohio, you know that your par-
ents will always love you.

So if you blame  in your
life — your grades, your bankruptcy,
your cocaine addiction, etc. — on

bad parenting, they will always for-

eternal scapegoats

give you, just like any good parent
should.

In the end, I would just recom-
mend buying as many as possible.

LetterstotheEditor

Dear Editor,

In his Oct. 3 column, “judges should adhere to the U.S. Constitution,” Bart Wischnowski claims it is “appalling that a
presidential candidate would reveal such shallow notions about the Constitution and the law.” However, I ﬁnd his column
far more appalling in its ﬂagrant use of double-speak and non sequitur deductions. _ .

One of his earliest arguments points to the case of Boumediene V. Bush, siding with Justice Scalia’s dissention to‘ the
5-4 decision. I’m not going to argue the merits of this decision, but I found this particular sentence disturbing: “Boume-
diene establishes the right of a detained enemy combatant to have access to civil courts in the United States, potentially
bestowing habeas corpus privileges on the very enemies who are ﬁghting against and killing our own men and women in
service.” ‘

This appeal strikes me as very propagandistic. It’s a slogan, not a valid argument. Wischnowski doesn’t explain to us
why he thinks detainees should not have access to due process. His assertion suggests that any detainee must be guilty,
despite the fact that these detentions are extrajudicial. As for the appeal to our armed forces, likewise, our troops are
ﬁghting against and killing their men and women, including civilians as well as combatants. This statement sidesteps the
argument for nothing more than a motto.

Another problem is Wischnowski’s distortion of Sen. Barack Obama’s statementabout what kind of judge he would
appoint to the Supreme Court. In summary, Obama wants a judge who will be sympathetic to a number of underprivi-
leged groups he lists. Wischnowski’s response is, “Apparently, some groups deserve more equality of justice under the law
than others in Barack Obama’s America,” and “Considering I don’t fall under any of these categories  I guess I should
be worried about my status as an American under an Obama administration.” Obama’s statement is not suggesting that
teenaged moms, poor people, blacks, gays, people with disabilities and the elderly deserve bias in their favor, but that
the justice he would appoint would be someone committed to defending the rights of those disadvantaged in society.
\Vischnowski’s suggestion that young, white, rniddle—class males will somehow become discriminated under such an ad-
ministration is complete nonsense.

I also take issue with Wischnowski’s authoritarian interpretation of the Constitution, as though it were some infallible
holy scripture. \While I don’t expect to come to terms with this school of thought, I do expect that its adherents devise
rational and honest arguments, not reactionary sloganeering.

Eoin Koepﬁnger
School of Arts and Sciences

Dear Editor,

The Oct. 3 Political Point-CounterPoint columns
about the Supreme Court seemed to miss the crux of

' the matter entirely. Shane Levy argues for a “living”

Constitution, adding that the Constitution shouldsbe
interpreted in such a way as to ﬁght social and econom-
ic injustice in modern times. The only objection Bart
Wischnowski seems to raise is that ﬁghting social and
economic injustice often entails violating the principle
that all Americans should get equal protection under
the law, rather than some people being more protected
than others. H

What Wischnowski only hinted at, I want to state in
no uncertain terms: A “living” Constitution is a consti-
tution in name only. Any interpretation that depends on
factors other than the meaning of the document’s writ-
ers is nothing more than politics — and especially in
today’s day and age, we can’t afford to play politics with
our best protection from tyranny. The framers were not
oblivious to the fact that changing times would call for
changing government. That is why they included an
amendment process.

Sure, the Constitution was written in a spirit of
equality, but if our president, representatives, senators
and Supreme Court justices violate the letter of the law

A every day, how can we expect the spirit to survive?

What a stud! Tony Clifton and his Katrina Kiss My Ass Orchestra will dance through East Carson Street

“Hey baby, this is Tony Clifton.
Sweetheart, how you doin’?”

In a heavy New ]ersey—tough,
slinky-lounge—singer voice, Tony
Clifton introduced himself. The
one and only caustic Tony Clifton,
in his own words, “an interna-
tional singing sensation,” the man
who caused Tinseltown to shud-

’ der long before the late—night talk

shows glowed with the exploits of
latent childhood actors.

Sporting thick mutton chops
and a heavy mustache paired with
1970s—era aviator shades, Clifton
marches through and over old
standards in his performances.

“They’re the songs I was
brought up with, the ones that I
love. And they all have to do with
love, lost love or lust,” he said.

But his performance is no
straightforward drive down mem-
ory lane. In between songs or even
lines, Clifton is apt to riff on au-
dience members, tell bad Polish
jokes and talk about his sex life.

This is something Pittsburgh au-
diences can judge for themselves
this weekend when “The Return
of Tony Clifton and the Katrina
Kiss My Ass Orchestra,” takes
center stage at the Rex Theater.
The tour’s musicians and danc-
ers all hail from Louisiana, and all
proceeds go to help Gulf Coast
victims of Hurricane Katrina.

A Las Vegas lounge singer
most often attired in a ruffled tux-
edo, Clifton was “discovered” by
comedian Andy Kaufman in 1968.
\While it is widely accepted that
Clifton was a character created by
Kaufman, allowing the comedian
to rage at Hollywood stufﬁness
and the trappings of stardom,
Clifton remains ﬁrm that he is his
own performer, that Kaufman “is if
a kook” who stole his identity.

“Andy Kaufman came to
see Elvis, and hesaw me m the

troupe of back-up dancers billed
as “burlesque,” by Comic Relief,
the organization running the tour.

“It’s a cross between a Las
Vegas show and a Grateful Dead
show that’s what people have
told me,” said Clifton.

“I’m a song and dance man at
heart,” he added, sounding very
much like his professedly hated
colleague Andy Kaufman in Milo
Forman’s biopic “The Man on the
Moon.” But such a suggestion
was rebuffed.

“Myself, I don’t get it, why they

made a movie of this guy’s life. I’m
glad it happened, it put my name
out there, but I don’t understand
that guy’s career, what the public
saw in Andy Kaufman. Kaufman
wasn’t a singer, he wasn’t a dancer,
he wasn’t a comedian, then what
the hell was he all about?” he
yelled.
But if Clifton was so against Kauf-
man, why did he agree to perform
in “Man on the Moon?” And for
that matter, a humanitarian aid
tour that he claims he’s doing in
order to fulﬁll 60 hours of com-
munity service? '

‘Robot Chicken‘ is, frame by frame, fantastic

by Tom VanBuren
Se/zior Stzzﬂ U7/‘il'er

Matthew Senreich has never
doubted that work can be fun. In
fact, the co—creator of Adult Swim’s
“Robot Chicken” has based his en-
tire career on that principle.

When Senreich met actor Seth
Green, the two kindled a friend-
ship forged in geekdom, and their
mutual love of action ﬁgures and
Gen—X pop culture led to the cre-
ation of what is now Adult Swim’s
highest—rated original show. How
did a mild—mannered magazine edi-
tor from New York become one of
Cartoon Network’s clown princes
of comedy? The Pitt News spoke
with Senreich to ﬁnd out.

The Pitt News: What did you
want to be when you grew up?

Matthew Senreich: [laughs] You
know, I think I grew up a little early.
I always wanted to work in comic

books when I was growing up, and _

when I was 16, I had the chance to
intern at Marvel comics. I realized
at a very young age that I could do
what I love, which was really nice.

TPN: Did you, ever think back
then you would be making a living
off of action ﬁgures?

MS: No, the fact that I get to
play with toys and get paid for it is
baffling. It’s been a really nice ride.

My parents are / still shocked that
I’m getting paid to do this.

TPN: What did they expect
from you?

CMS: You know, my dad’s a doc-
tor, my mom’s an accountant, they
were looking for one of the two,
but they’ve been nothing but sup-
portive.‘ My mom ‘ actually drove
me to Marvel _comics and sat in the
waiting room while I had my inter-
view.

TPN: What’s the dynamic like
between you and Seth Green? It
seems like you just met through
Wizard [Magazine] and hit it off.

MS: Yeah, I think our love of
toys and comics really connected
us. We just do  that we think
are funny for ourselves, and we
hope other people are in on the
joke with us. We share a very small

- ofﬁce because we have separation‘
anxiety from each other.

TPN: You get quite a variety of
celebrities on the show. How" do
you tap these people?

MS: You know, when we start-
ed, it was one of those situations
where nobody knew our show, and
it was a lot of calling out favors. But
we had this inﬂux of people at the
beginning — Burt Reynolds, Dom
Deluise, Ryan Seacrest, people who
we just reached out to and begged

and pleaded with, and they took a
chance on us and had a good time.

After that it became easier to
get people to come in, because
they realized we’re just" gooﬁng
around and playing with toys and
having fun with an this. Cee—Lo (of
Gnarls Barkley) tracked down Seth
at a concert and said, “I want to do
Robot Chicken.” It’s been great like
that, and we’ve been very blessed"

with it.

‘ TPN: Stop-motion animation
comes with a lot ‘of technical lirni—
tations. How is it a good or a bad ﬁt

‘ for the show?

MS: It’s good in the sense that
it’s 3D and it’s tangible, you’re ac-
tually seeing the toys you grew up
with come to life. But we need an

I animator on stage moving them

in increments and moving them
frame-by-frame. Each animator
does about eight seconds a day,
which is an exhausting process.

It’s hard for us to do political
humor, because ' we’re  it
now, and it’s going to come out af-
ter the election. So we can’t really

do jokes about [GoV. Sarah] Palin or
' put [Sen. Barack] Obama in there,

you just don’t know who’s going to
end up winning. ‘If this comes out
May of next year, it’s just going to
be pointless.

“Robot Chicken” has found its

who love to see the entertainment of
their childhood scrupulously satiiized.
The populaiity of the Emmy—winning

good money and I work less, I got nothing

tery, or something like that, right?”

But there is more to his actions than just
paychecks. Beloved of  Henson, Clifton
was asked to perform in “The Fantastic Miss
Piggy Show” in l982 after he had riled up -
Hollywood so much “that no one would
touch me.”

When asked to describe the experience
he mused, “Henson believed so much in
those characters, maybe that’s what added to
their believability.”

His conjecturing made me wonder if he
didn’t think of himself in the same way — a
character worthy of an audience’s unques'—
tioning indulgence. But before I could ask,
he said suddenly, “Wanna hear me rhyme?”
and then quickly switched directions to ask

_, REEL TALK WITH ToM L . _
In   America,   our II10V1eS-
are in English, damn it!

by Tom VanBuren
Senior Staﬂ Writer

Love movies? Hate reading? Good

‘ news!

i “Let the Right One In” is Sweden’s lat-
est cinematic export, and the buzz for the
upcoming American release'is building fast.
I think it’s about vampires or something. I

can’t tell, because the trailer is in Swedish
with English subtitles.

What the hell? Maybe nobody told Mag- . .

net Releasing, the U.S. distribution compa-
ny, but thisiis America. If I wanted to read,
I’d pick up a book —- like, I don’t know, the
one this movie is based on. Isn’t the point
of movies freeing people like me from
the tyranny of the written word? I refuse
to even read the opening credits, which is
why I always take a date that will read them
aloud for me: ‘ ' i I
Thankfully, Hollywood has a plan. It’s
going to remake the movie for American
audiences _— presumably with more explo-

I sions and boobies.

See, Hollywood knows how things
work. So what if the original movie hasn’t
even been "released here yet? It’s‘ going to
suck, obviously, so theres no point in§wast-
ing time before making it again and making
it better. ' ‘ ' ‘I

Maybe the producers could fast—track
the movie so that it comes out at the same
time as the original —— there’s no reason a

bunch of IKEA lovers and word readers

should get to see the movie before Joe Six-
pack Americans like me. Or illiterates.

What’s _even better is that “Cloverﬁeld” V

director Matt Reeves is slated to helm the
Englishiﬁed version. ' ’ '
Some foreign ﬁlm elitists worry that he
won’t be able to channel the, subtle tones
of the source; material, but I have noth-

ing but faith in any ﬁlmmaker who blows—

up the goth chick from “Mean Girls” on

camera. 

The point is, American ﬁlmmakingi is
taking a step in the right direction by remak-

 

! ing this movie. History just goes to prove

that Americans won’t tolerate reading in
the cinema. “The Passion of the Christ?”
Box office bomb. “Pan’s Labyrinth?” Criti-
cal disaster! Foreign language ﬁlms have
“failure” written all over them —. all over

‘the bottom of the screen, in blockyyellow

letters.’ . e I ~ ~ -- ~
Unfortunately, “Let the Right One In”
director Tomas Alfredson doesn’t seem
to understand the average American ﬁlm-
goer. -

“I’m very proud of my movie and think
it’s great,” he told Swedish ﬁlm Web site
Moviezine. “If you’d spent years on paint-
ing a picture, you’d hate to hear buzz about

' a copy even before your vernissage!”
“Vernissage?” That’s your problem right

there, buddy. You thinkiyou can march in
here with your fancy foreign words and
your critically acclaimed ﬁlm and just make
people want to see your ‘version of things
instead of one that’s marginally based on

it with the same title and aibigger budget. ‘

Let me know when Michael Bay makes a
louder, cooler version of anything else you

might have to say — maybe then it will‘

hold my interest.

Having your movie remade for English-
speaking-but-not—English-reading audienc-
es is an honor, and I hope you remember

that when Matt Reeves is sleeping on piles *

of American dollars that your movie didn’t
make. '

Just think, somebody saw yourmovie ’

and thought, “Hey, that was so great, I wish

i I had made it — Ah hell, I’ll do it anyway!”
- Maybe you’ll learn from this and not make

any more movies in your silly dead language

— then you might get a little more credit. _
‘Personally, I’m glad that Hollywood is

already remaking" a movie that isn’t even
out YCII. I _ '

Hopefully in the future, they won’t‘ even
wait this long, and different countries can

all just shoot different versions of the same

movie for themselves simultaneously.
Except that ours will always be better.
Because ours will be in English. . ‘

Love @‘ Izfe is geared toward an adult
audience with some sexually charged songs

“You’re the Only One.” \With this record,
Benet ignites a ﬂame that is hard to put out

popularity, Benet’s voice can certainly match
the range and tonal quality of any R&B artist
in the industry. His songs are poignant, ma-
ture and socially conscious in an overly satu3
rated mainstream of never—ending choruses
and kindergarten lyrics. Gospel and soul un-
dertones dance playfully throughout, which
gives -the album a Temptations—like feel.
Benet croons over a lover in the me-
lodic feature song, “Chocolate Legs” with
lyrics like, “Girl, it’s so rough in this city /
There ain’t no resting for the weary / So
baby feel me / I need something to feel.”
A gentle acoustic  hums effortlessly
in the background following a soft snare as

Benet lets his lady know just how much she ’

means to him. Through shear emotional
willpower, Benet is able to counteract cliches

and corniness alike with his velvety smooth '

In contrast, Benet’s duet with Terry Dex-
ter, “Everlove,” is as heartfelt as a love song
can be. Dexter and Benet’s voices mesh well,
creating smooth harmonies that “Iminluv-
wichoo” fails to even attempt.

Although “Everlove” is sung over and
over again, the change in melodies and tone
allows the phrase to recur without much hin-
drance to a truthful and touching piece. The
poetic nature of the chorus, “Everlasting
through all changes in our lives / Everlove
you’re my everlove / ever-growing everyday
and every night” is an effective foray into us~
ing repetition.

1 Most of the tracks on Love e’?’I_-zfe convey
a love between couples and lovers, but the
opening venture, “Love Patience & Time” is
more of a love song about faith, family and
forgiveness. The uplifting gospel tune is ac-
‘ cented by jazz trumpets and a bit of piano.

Benet never gets too‘ political on the album, '

but his lyrics speak socially about paciﬁsm
on this track — “Somepeople swear that
blood and fear / \X/ill bring the world togeth-
er / But I believe that all we need is love /
Patience anditime.” The song has bounce to
it that carries over to the rest of the record.

‘ If you are looking for an album with sub-

stance, soul and sex, Love e’7’ Lzfe is one of-

the better ones out there. Just turn down the
lights and tell Barry White you are out of
town.

Raiders. I can’t help but watch
every year as Davis, the 79-year-
old owner of the franchise, who

ling a professional football team.
It’s great! ‘

It’s all I’ve been paying atten-

entertainment—like debates, the
WNBA playoffs and the MLB

I’m speaking of none other

seems to continue his descent

tion to recently, and these past
few weeks have brought on great

playoffs (by the way, did you
know “Frank TV” starts Oct.
21? What? He does impressions
of George W Bush and Al Paci-
no? Oh, how hilarious, please tell
me he has a Christopher Walken
impression, too).

On Sept. 30, four games into
the season, Davis ofﬁcially ﬁred
head coach Lane Kifﬁn, ending
months of speculation that the
ﬁrst—time head coach would be
let go. The Raiders were 1-3 on
the season and 5-15 overall un-
der Kifﬁn. Like any good show,
Davis was able to stretch out the
inevitable with months of “will
he/won’t he” speculation and
still make it compelling.

It was reported in January by
ESPN’s Chris Mortensen that
Davis wrote a letter (because
he’s so old) to Kifﬁn, telling him

that he will not have control over
which coaches he can keep or
ﬁre and which players the Raid-
ers acquire through the draft and
free agency. This was after news
leaked that Kifﬁn hoped to get
rid of defensive coordinator Rob
Ryan but was told he couldn’t.

It was also reported that Da-
vis wrote up a letter of resigna-
tion for Kifﬁn, who clearly didn’t
see the good will in this act and
refused to sign it. *

The Raiders still claim this
never happened, and Kifﬁn re-
fuses to comment on the claims.
But would Chris Mortensen lie
to us? Doubtful.

Multiple times during sum-
mer workouts and preseason
Kifﬁn criticized Davis through
the media. He claimed Davis was
in charge of everything from

director of player personnel to
occasional defensive coordinator
and that the two were most cer-
tainly feuding.

Kifﬁn also criticized the
front ofﬁce for spending money
on players that didn’t deserve
it, such as wide receiver Javon
Walker and defensive lineman
Tommy ‘Kelly. Kifﬁn also said
during training camp that the
team needed to cut players who
were hurt or not performing and
ﬁnd more competitive guys, but
it: wasn’t his choice.

The Raiders lost to the Bron-
cos, 41-14, in their ﬁrst game of
the season. Afterward, Kifﬁn
said that Ryan and Davis are in
charge of the defense for games,
and he has no part in it.

Warren Sapp, well-known star
dancer and cheeseburger aﬁcio-

Al Davis? Definitely the best show in years

nado, came out and said Davis
never gave Kifﬁn a fair shot to
run the team. Sapp played with
the Raiders for four years, and
is now an analyst on “Inside the
NFL,” the show in which he
made the comments.

Sapp said if Davis would stay
home, the Raiders would be a
functional organization. He also
said Davis even called plays from
the owner’s box while he was in
Oakland.

Before the ﬁring, Davis wrote
another letter to Kifﬁn (presum-
ably because he’s not aware of
e-mail and he lost his Carrier pi-
geon), telling the coach that if he
violated his contract, he would
be ﬁred.

The letter aired out a lot of
the issuesthe two had. It was like
counseling, except with only one

,1. Rutgers 1, Pitt 0

The Pitt women’s soccer team fell
to Rutgers in the ﬁnal minutes Friday,
losingin a 1-0 decision.

Rutgers scored  the game’s ﬁnal
10 minutes to pull out the victory.

‘  Pitt coach Sue—Moy Chin said de-

spite the loss, she was happy with the
performance of her defense

“Our defense really stepped up in
the ﬁrst half’ said Chin. V

Pitt starting goalkeeper Moxie

"f9-vs-'Kephart made four saves on ﬁve

shots in the game On the other side,
Rutgers’ goalkeeper Erin Guthrie only
faced two shots and ﬁnished with a
shutout

Asitwasduringthe ﬁrsthalf,the
second half of the game was the same
defensive struggie.

“We had a real hard time gener-
ating scoring Chances,” said Chin of
Pitt’s second-half performance.

Neither team recorded a shot in
the ﬁrst 30 minutes of the half Rut-
gers recorded three shots on net in the

second half, while Pitt recorded just I

One of Rutgers?» three shots in the
second half was the game-winning
goal scored by forward Caycie Guz-
man in the 82nd minute _
Guzmanreceivedapassinthebox
from Gina DeMaio and placed the
ball in the top right corner of the net
Becky Wise also contributed an assist

on the play.

Pitt’s two shots in the second half
were both on goal.

The shots were taken by senior
midﬁelder Jennifer Kritch and fresh-
man midﬁelder Katelyn Ruhe Both
were saved by Guthrie in the ﬁnal
minute of the game

Seton Hall 1, Pitt 0

Pitt must be sick of dropping
games because of unanswered sec-
ond-half goals Like Rutgers Friday
night, Seton Hall handed the Panthers
21 1-0 loss in Newjersey. ,

“We just haven’t been capitalizing" '
on our  chances,” said Chin,
referring to Pitt’s inability to score de-
spite 13 shots on net

And like Chin said, Pitt had its
chances.

Pitt sophomore forward Liz Car-
roll took an early shot that went just
wide of the net But Pitt’s best scoring
chance came on a shot taken by Kate-
lyn Ruhe in the 23rd minute The shot
was blocked by Seton Hall goalkeeper
Elizabeth Bond

Pitt defender Christina Nicassio
suffered the same fate when Bond
made a save in the 37th minute Bond
ﬁnished the game with ﬁve saves

Seton Hall broke the scoring
drought when midﬁelder Katie An-
dreski scored in the 52nd minute

Andreski scored on a skillﬁil cross-
ing pass delivered by Taylor Wilson

Caitlyn lVIilazzo  the play

side of the ﬁeld and was also credited
with an_assist.

Big East troubles continue for Women's soccer

Still, Pitt couldn’t come through
with the win. But Chin said she
thought the team played well enough
towin.

“We really felt like we outplayed
them in the second half,” said Chin.

Pitt dropped to 4-9-0 overall and _

1-4—0’in conference play, while Seton
Hall improved to 5-5-2 overall and
1-3-1 in conference play. 1

Pitt will play Connecticut next at
Founders Field on Friday It marks a
stretch of four straight home games
against Big East opponents.

Kickoff is set for 7 pin.

The Huskies are coming off a 2-1
loss to Cincinnati on Sunday. Con-
necticut enters the game with a 3-7-3
overall record and 1-2-2 mark in the
Big East.   ’

Starting to take more risks, the Pitt defense came through with a goal when it counted
over the weekend. Pitt is now 6-4-1 overall and 2-5-0 in the Big East.

Men's soccer, page 13

with a .891 save percentage.
“The few good chances they got, Jordan
D/Iarks] made some big saves,” said Lux-

bacher.

While the defense has been great, the area ‘

of concern for Luxbacher and his staff has
been the offense.

In past weeks, Luxbacher has commend-
ed the level of effort his players show in prac-
tice and games, but stressed the point that his
team just wasn’t creating enough chances to
score goals.

“We committed more guys to attack to-
day. We took more risks, and it ended up with
a really good goal,” said Luxbacher.

With better offense and continual solid

defense, the Panthers pulled out an impres-
sive victory on Sunday.
“I think we deserved to win this game,”
said Luxbacher. .
The win moves Pitt to 6-4-1 overall and
improves its conference record to 2-3-0.

While the Panthers may have found a rec— I

ipe for success, the team will endure another
test as they continue play in the extremely
competitive Big East conference.

Pitt will face off against archrival West
Virginia in Morgantown tomorrow. night.
The Mountaineers are coming off a huge up-
set over No. 7-ranked Connecticut on Friday.

The team then travels to South Bend, Ind.,

to face No. 3—ranked Notre Dame Saturday.

Davis gives presentation

, Littman, page l5

willing party and without any conﬁdential-
ity. And it was also probably a very one-
sided account of‘what happened. Think of
it like a confessional on a reality show put
into letter-form. I

“I do realize that you did not want us to ~

draft ]aMarcus Russell,” said Davis in his
letter of the team’s No. 1 overall pick in the
2007 NFL Draft. “He is a great player. Get
over it and coach this team on the ﬁeld,
that is what you were hired to do. We can
win with this team!”

Although it might read like it, the letter
was not written in crayon. It was shown at
the press conference to announce Kifﬁn’s
ﬁring using an overhead projector.

Seriously. An overhead projector.

_ Rumor has it that the next Raiders home
game is going to be Lane Kifﬁn voodoo
doll night, followed by Lane Kifﬁn dart-
board night a few weeks later. ,

In that ‘same press conference, Davis

repeatedly said Kifﬁn was a “ﬂat—out liar,” _

and he disgraced the organization. Mind

you, the Raiders have lost 11 games ﬁve ‘

straight seasons, which ties the NFL record

held by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, so dis-

gracing that even further is quite a feat.
Davis is clearly the greatest villain on

TV today: a real life Mr. Burns, if you will."

Would you honestly be surprised if Davis
tried to block out the sun? .

Kifﬁn was the Raiders’ ﬁfth ‘coach in
the-last six years, all of whom were ﬁred.
He was replaced by Tom Cable, the team_’s
offensive line coach. W/e’ll most likely have
to wait a few more weeks to see just how
Cable is let go from his position, but it will
happen.

The Pitt News 0 www.pittnews.com

Davis surely has set the bar high with his ‘
Kifﬁn performance, but I have no doubts
he can top that-. There’s really only way to
see just how he ends up ﬁring Cable.

Just watch, baby.
