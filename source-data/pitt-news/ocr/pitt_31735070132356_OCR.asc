Pitt students
may light up
soap screen

KATIE LEONARD
. Assistant News Editor

Two Pitt students got the news they’d
been waiting for when their ’names were‘
announced on CBS’s “The Early Show” last
Tuesday morning.

Since auditioning in the Wlliam Pitt
Union iI1 late September, Bill Morse and Liz’
Vitalbo had been waiting to ﬁnd out if they
would be selected to «audition for a role on
the soap opera “Guiding Light.” Along with
all the other viewers, the two learned from
the announcement that they would audition
live on an episode of the  show this
week A T
When Vitalbo heard her name, she
experienced the “biggest relief,” she said.
Morse said that when he heard his name, he
“spazzed out” and yelled so loud he co111d

_ have woken up his entire apartment com-

plex. .
Morse’s celebration, though, was short
lived —— it lasted or11y 10 minutes. He still
had to give a presentation two hours after he
heard the news, andthe had a paper to write
and a test to study for. .

According to Vrtalbo, the combination
of emotions she had during" the day she
heard the news made her feel like she “was
hit by a truck” when she woke up the next
morning. But Morse was quick to add that
neither of them would complain about the
emotional rush.

The two, who both went to ‘Seton-
LaSalle High School in the South Hills and
beat out hundreds of other local college stu-
dents for the audition opportunity, have
shared the stage in several performances.

It was only after Morse happened to see
Vrtalbo on the day of the auditions that she
learned aboutthe “Soap Star Screen Test”
auditions that won her a spot on ‘The Early
Show.” . p . . P

China cails practice an “evil cult”

WILL SCHEFF
Staff Writer

To the women who displayed the

meditative practice at the William Pitt .

Union’s lower lounge Thursday night,
Falun Gong is a way to promote better
health and a stronger moral character. But

to Chinese officials it is an “evil cult,” -

according to a Pitt political science profes-
sor who says the ongoing debate is becom-
ing in/creasingly political. ~
Falun Gong originated in .China,
where the government accepted it as
another _form of Chi Gong exercises -—~-

_ . various practices, such as Tai Chi, that pro-

mote clarity of mind and physical well-
being. Its founder, LiHongzhi, was a for-
mer government official .who receiyed
several awards from a committee of spe-

cialists at the Oriental Health Expo in ~

1993. ..
p The Pitt workshop featured placards
and magazines ﬁlled with gruesome pic-

» tures depicting alleged victims of Chinese. .

torture. Human rights groups around the

‘ world accuse the Chinese government of I

persecuting Falun Gong members. But
Sun Weide, a spokesman for the Chinese
embassy in Washington, D.C., denied
these allegations. . .

‘‘That’s not true,” _Sun said. “Our gov- ‘

ernrnent has been very ‘patient. Our "policy
is persuasion and education. We’re ‘trying
very hard to educate them in the danger of
practicing Falun Gong.” ’ V
Sun went on to detail some of these

' dangers, describing how the leader of
-Falun Gong is trying to bring about the

“explosion of the Earth” but has delayed
doing so, at least for the next 30 years, at
the request of Chinese ofﬁcials. ' '
’ Emma Jin, a Monroeville-based soft-
ware designer, Falun Gong member and
co-organizer of the event at Pitt, laughed
and ‘shook her head when these accusa-

Superman, witches and a
shark among best buddies

ROCHELLE HENTGES
Senior Staff Writer

Dressed in a blue body suit displaying
six-pack abs, and with red underwear and a
cape as accessories, Superman got up in
front of a crowd Saturday and sang the lyrics
to the Temptations’ “My Girl.”

Accompanying him was 21-year-old
Aubrey Silford and an unidentiﬁed Pirates
baseball fan. The diverse crowd of about 40,
which boogied down to the music, included
cowboys and girls, witches, devils, Michael
Myers, a shark and a soldier.

This Halloween party, taking place
exactly one week after Halloween because
of room-scheduling diﬁiculties, was thrown
by .Pitt’s Best Buddies organization.

The organization, begun in 1987 by
John F. Kennedy’s nephew Anthony Shriver,

matches an intellectually disabled person 1

with a Pitt student who has similar interests.

The intellectually disabled can hear
about Best Buddies through their casework-
ers, or through Best Buddies’ community
partnerships with organizations like Family

The goal of the program is as simple as
offering friendship to those who have a hard
time ﬁnding it on their own.

“The problem is a lot of [the intellectu-
ally disabled] get ridiculed because of their
disabilities,” said Aaron Probst, co-president
ofBestBuddies. ..  , , _

Matched “buddies” can form lasting
ﬁiendships by getting together to go bowl-
ing, eat lunch or do other fun things, said
Probst, dressed in army fatigues and combat
boots. ’

Mike Long, aka. Superman, met his
buddy, Aubrey Siﬁ‘ord, for the ﬁrst time at
the party. _

Long joined the program in his ﬁrst

semester here at Pitt because he had done
similar things with Special Olympics and
“really enjoyed it.”

Best Buddies seemed like a great way to
become involved and gain friendships, he
said. “You get to meet people  pretty much
the same at heart.”

As for Aubrey Sifford, he seemed to
take to Long immediately, putting his arm
around him and proclaiming that he already
liked spending time with him

Later, in an icebreaker game, the party-
goers formed a circle. One person, standing
in the middle, had to choose a person from
the circle, ask their name and get them to
smile.

Instead of introducing themselves with
a handshake, many opted for a hug. ,.

Once it was Aubry Siﬁ°ord’s turn in the
middle, he walked up to Long and asked
him to smile. Unable to contain his smile, it
was Long’s turn to go into the middle.

“Aubrey, good job,” he said, high-ﬁving
Sifford. “You got me.” . ‘ -

Aubrey Siﬁord’s mom, Frankie Sitford, A
said she hopes that the Best Buddies pro-

gram will be good for her son.

“He’s always had problems with kids,” A

she said The children in her housing com-
plex are younger and don’t know how to
have a friendship with him, she said “It’s so
hard forhirn to interact with the ki .”

With the Best Buddies program, he can
“have somebody that he can talk to  [and]
do things with,” Frankie Silford said. _

Joy Braun, 44, knows something about
this. “I feel like I’ve ﬁnally got a friend,” said

-Braun, who has been buddies with Best I

Buddies co-President Ranit Lieberman for
three and a half years.

has become a campus celebrity as one of the
stars of The Creation Station’s “Lothrop,
What, What” and “Headhunter.” He joking-
ly added that he appeared in the May 1998
edition of Playgirl, as well.

Vitalbo began acting when she was six
years old and has continued by working with
the Pittsburgh Musical Theater at the Byham
Theater Downtown. She has also done some
local modeling. _ A

“I want [this] to be a big break,” Vitalbo
told a man at her ﬁrst interview.

“Look, I’ve been doing small acting for
years,” she added. “I need a kick in the ass.”

After their initial auditions at Pitt,
Morse, Vitalbo and fewer than 20 other peo-
ple — split between men and women —-
were called back later in the day. They all
auditioned again with microphones and TV
cameras. They were then told to watch the
Nov. 4 episode of “The Early Show” when
the ﬁnalists would be announced, following
similar auditions at four other colleges.

After next week’s live auditions, there
will be an online vote — at www.cbs.com
— to determine the winner. The winner will
get a guaranteed week contract with the soap
opera, with an option for an extension. When
“As the World Turns” held a similar contest,
therewere about 10,000 votes, Morse said.

Even if she doesn’t win, Vitalbo said
this experience will be a great way to make
connections in the business.

“I can’t say anything negative about
[soap operas],” Morse added. “It’s where so
many stars have started”

. The live auditions have Vitalbo a bit
scared because, as she said, “Not only do

hope to be stars

you look like an ass, you look like an ass in
front of a national audience.”

Vitalbo doesn’t think the casting direc-
tors were necessarily looking at acting abili-
ty during the earlier auditions — they were
more interested in the character, personality
and passion of the perfonners, she said. This
time, though, she expects the American pub-
lie to vote based on the acting ability of each
person auditioning.

Morse, who is in his junior year, is look— ‘

ing toward his future —— and that future does-
n’t include a normal, traditional job behind a
desk, he said.

After getting through all of his work for
die week, Morse planned to go to the Pitt-
Virginia Tech football game. Vitaldo said she
was would be studying her script all week

“Oh yeah, I forgot about that,” Morse
said after hearing V1taldo’s plans. ,/

Morse will ﬂy to New York on Sunday
night to appear on Monday’s “The Early
Show,” while Vitaldo will appear on
Tuesday’s show.

,Both Morse and Vitaldo admitted that
they were not big soap opera buifs.

That helps" explain one of the situations .

Morse got into at his ﬁrst audition. While
waiting in line, he noticed an attractive

woman and started talking to her. After a few _

minutes of what turned into ﬂirting, she said

she had to get back to work. After she left, '

someone standing near him in line excitedly
asked, ‘How do you lmow Aubrey?”

Apparently, the woman he had been
talking to was Aubrey Dollar, better known
to “Guiding Light” fans as Marina Cooper. '

“I was trying to hook up with Aubrey
Dollar,” Morse said. “Maybe this will be my
shot.”

Candidates offer answers, challenges

ness to devise a new system of allocation.
“I am really here to serve,” he said.
Lauren Williams, a junior, also

addressed the topic, stating that the alloca-

tions system needs to be improved, and

issued a call for students to come to her with .

suggestions. Williams is a cunent SGB
member rimning for reelection.

“Challenge me, contact me and try me,”
she said A l

A major theme of the night was devel-
oping projects designed to make the
University more attractive to both current
and future students. Matt Hutchinson, a
junior, focused on the various athletic pro-
grams at Pitt, such as making Midnight
Madness a more important event. .

Hutchison cited the University of
Kansas as a role model for Midnight
Madness. Improving the night could make
Pitt more attractive to future students, he
said

“I want to make Pitt a better place for
students to come to,” he added

Liz Blasi had ideas to increase school

spirit through decorating the William Pitt
Union, as well as removing the fee needed to
use the downstairs lounge, which contains
billiards and ping pong tables. To play bil-
liards, students now have to pay $3 an hour.

Creating an online rating system for Pitt
professors, such as pickaprof.corn, was also
brought up during- the forum. According to
Board candidate Solange-Rishona Clarke,
Pitt could avoid paying a high subscription
fee for such a system if it created its own pro-
gram; which could be put into place in a
short time period .

Clarke argued against the idea that such

a system would not only open the professors

up to unwananted attacks, but that it might
violate certain rights to privacy. : -
After each candidate was allowed to

make a brief statement about themselves and

their platforms, the audience was allowed to
submit questions to members of a panel,

who decided which questions were appro-

date Joseph Salvatore about a fall break.

Sun also said he was happy that “the
American people are realizing more about
this cult,” since Falun Gong members “are
trying to damage relations between China
and America.” “Falun” refers to a “wheel”
of energy that can be found in the stomach,
according to Sun. He said that some peo-
ple have injured themselves, often fatally,
by cutting open their stomachs to ﬁnd this
“wheel.”

Pitt political science professor Wen
Fang Tang said that he has seen such
reports, and that they enhance the cult-like
impression of Falun Gong.

don’t we hear such reports outside of
China, in any of the other countries where
Falun Gong is practiced?”

Jin believes that such injuries are
caused by torture.‘ She has traveled to
Geneva twice in the past four years to
appeal to‘ the United Nations armual
human rights conferences.

“We are not doing this for political
reasons, but for the human rights issue. We
don’t do this to beneﬁt anything or anyone
in any way except to stop the persecution,”
she said.

Studies conducted by eight diﬁerent
Chinese universities and hospitals in 1998
show evidence that the meditation and
physical motions of Falun Gong, not only
improve physical and mental health, but

  

might also have _a healing effect on disease.
Over time, the popularity of Falun

Gong has grown dramatically, and more

than 100 million people in nearly 60 coun-
tries now practice it worldwide. A T

But in 1999, the Chinese government
began to crack down on Falun Gong fol-
lowers after a controversial gathering at a
government building. a

Sun said that Falun Gong practitioners
tried to hijack a government building in
China. But Jin said that it was a peaceful
gathering, the meaning of which was dis-
torted by the Chinese government.

Jin said that the government harassed
Falun Gong members, prior to the inci-
dent, because their numbers had exceeded
the number of people registered in China’s

Communist Party.

The gathering was meant to appeal to

Chinese officials, who never responded to
a deluge of letters asking for the persecu-
tion to stop, Jin said.

“I don’t think it was political, because
no matter who went there, they didn’t do
anything violent,” Jin said. “You can see
from pictures: they were just trying to talk
to the government. They weren’t shouting
or waving barmers. It’s not true that they
were trying to attack the government.”

Another contested issue involves an
incident in which Falun Gong members
took control of a Chinese cable television
broadcast to show alleged acts of brutality
conducted by Chinese officials. Tang said
the act constituted a “deliberate attempt to
interrupt a government operation.” T

Jin, doesn’t deny that the act seems

. contrary to the teachings of Falun Gong,
‘which promote peace and forbearance.

But she added that there was no‘ other
‘way to show people such images in a

nation . where the media is controlled _
. entirely by the government.

“I know this is illegal, as it is in the
US,” Jin said. “But we have no other way
to show our voice. We didn’t hurt anyone;
it’s the only way we- know to show people
(in China) the ‘tru .”

Tang believes that the -popularity of
Falun Gong grew so rapidly because of an
“ideo1ogicalvacuum” in Chinese commu-
nism that arose ‘ﬁom twenty years of
reforms after the Maoist regime fell. -

He said ‘market reforms gradually
increased economic gaps and “created a
whole spectrum of people who felt
betrayed.” " j ’

“I see this as a deeper social and polit-
ical issue than just the unpopularity of
Falun Gong,” _Tang said. He added that
many Chinese are becoming distrustful of
the practice because of a media campaign
by the Chinese government.

The United States Congress has
passed legislation calling for the end of

persecution against Falun Gong practition- ;

ers, both in China and in the United States.
Two resolutions,-numbered 188 and 304,

Braun was even inspired to make a

In between conversations and making
new friends, the buddies could munch’ on

sing and dance to karaoke. -

Fall break, allocations refonn, ﬁnancial aid among topics debated

Salvatore responded by stating that a
fall break would not disrupt the school

schedule, as it would only be a few days long p

when combined with a weekend.

. The two presidential candidates, current
Board members Jesse Horstrnann and Brian
Kelly, were asked about their experiences
with the allocations system.

Horstmann said he, like other students,
thinks the system is complicated and hard to
ﬁx because of the difficulty understanding it

“If the students can’t understand it, and
it is not beneﬁting them, then what good is

‘ it?” he asked. _ .

Kelly added that an activities, fee
increase would be needed to meet the

demands of the many student organizations
on campus, both old and new.

“Student organizations are being
choked,” he said.

Todd Brandon Morris, who’s running
for reelection on the Board, talked about the
$700,000 he helped bring to Pitt in federal
funding that went to help students.

Another Board member running for re-

election, Charis Jones, also cited her-

attempts to bring more money to Pitt, and
that a consistent approach will help.

Amit Kotz spoke about campus unity
and improving the transportation system.

Joseph Pasqualichio focused on the cre-
ation of a miniature version of the popular E-
bay site, where students could buy and sell
goods on a carnpus—run network He also

expressed the need for Pitt to institute a fall
break to reduce strain on the student body.

The SGB Elections Committee hosted
this forum to increase voter awareness about
the candidates. When asked whether voting
should be done online, similar to the recent
Homecoming election, SGB Elections
Committee Chair Ryan G. Pitrnan said it
was critical.

“We think that the SGB elections are a
little more impactful than the homecoming
elections,” he said.

_ All students not in the College ‘of
General ‘Studies, which appropriates their
activities fees in a diﬁerent manner, will have
the opportunity to vote for the next SGB.
Students can also hear the two presidential
candidates speak at a Nov. 17 debate.

Primaries crucial to democratic process"

In light of tight economic times

and perceived lack of influence or‘

participation by voters, some states

are eliminating presidential pri-

maries, or considering doing so.
Primary elections work in dif-

ferent ways in different states. All '

primaries essentially telegraph the
wishes of those who vote in them to
state party delegates, who then
nominate that state’s choice of party
candidate. After all the states’ votes
are in, each party holds a national
nominating convention to finalize

their choice of candidate.

States that are dropping or are
considering dropping primaries are,
for the most part, going to replace
primaries with a caucus system that
is already in use by some states —
where the parties themselves direct-
ly nominate the delegates for the

convention, circumventing input
from Joe Democrat or Jane
Republican.

Republican-dominated legisla-
tures in Colorado, Kansas and Utah
have already scrapped the primaries
in favor of party caucuses. In light
of the current political landscape,
this is especially chilling.

President George W. Bush has
no opposition for the GOP nomina-
tion. Eliminating primaries in
Republican states utterly ensures
that Bush will get the nomination,
effectively quashing any possible

alternates to him on the Republican
ticket. While the chance of him
being dislodged is slim, eliminating
such a chance is hardly fair. ‘

The Democratic ticket, on the
other hand, is stuffed with potential
candidates. With such a wide vari-
ety of personalities and agendas to
choose from, it’s important to hear
the greatest possible number of
voices; otherwise the party ignores
constituents in whatqwill be a close
race. If, as in this case, every single
vote truly counts, discounting votes
from even one state is unacceptable.

‘States are complaining, and
rightly so, that voters are apathetic.
Primaries typically draw less than
20 percent of eligible voters.
However, eliminating primary elec-
tions will serve to reinforce the
complaint of the silent majority --
that their votes don’t count anyway.
Eliminating primary elections
serves as concrete proof to such cit-
izens that, truly, their opinions do
not matter, which will further dis-
courage their participation in the
democratic process.

Primary elections are too impor-
tant to be scrapped. The entire
nation is in financial trouble, and
it’s a sad fact. But for a nation that
prides itself on democracy and an
enfranchised citizenry, eliminating
these elections would be nothing
short of pathetic and shameful.

Come on, give training wheels 21 try

Dear Sex N’at:

"’My long-time boyfriend and I have, a
Vproblein — although we have an active sex

"life, it seems that neither of us can actually ‘

reach orgasm unless we’re the
one on top and in control. We
both can get really close, and
it’s not that things aren’t enjoy-
able, but when it comes to cli-
max, we just can’t get there. It’s
starting to feel a little degrading ._
 like we’re just masurrbating
on top of each other. I’ve

brought up ideas about
bondage or something like that
to spice things up but he seems
to just laugh it off every time.
Any ideas? A
— Ready and Willing

Dear RAW:

The primary issue between the two of
you is trust — but don’t take that the wrong
way. It’s not that you don’t necessarily trust
one another in terms of ﬁdelity or’ mutual
respect or any of those crucial relationship
issues. ’

It’s orgasm trust you lack.

The French call ‘an orgasm “le petit
mort” — literally, a little death. There’s a lot

of truth in that phrase. Dining and immedi—-

ately after an orgasm, we fall into a state sort
of like intoxication. You know the feeling —
stoned on your own sex chemicals.
Depending on your own chemical make-up
and the magnitude of the orgasm, you can
ﬁnd yourself completely out of it for several
minutes after coming.

It’s hard enough to get used to that feel-
ing of complete surrender, of total loss of
control, from yourself. To hand over that
level of bodily jurisdiction to someone else
can be kind of scary. The reason neither of
you can receive a decent orgasm ﬁom ﬂie
other is your terror at relinquishing so much
control over yourself to an external entity.-

 

Melissa Meinzer
Opinions Editor

It’s wonderful to come — in addition to
being a cheap, legal high, it promotes feel-
ingsuof overall well-being, and associating
such feelings with someone you love. That’s
why love and sex belong together.

I That said, no one ever
comes every time. That’s an
example of a ludicrous stan-
dard, and trying to adhere to it
is a recipe for failure and feel-
ings of inadequacy for both of

ming in Inadequate Lake, you
aren’t going to get oif again for
a while.
‘ Take the focus off of com-
ing during intercourse, at least
for a while. Get comfortable
letting your man push your
button. Try orgasmic training
wheels. Have him watch you masturbate —
and vice versa. When you reach the point of
no return, have him take over. Then, he’ll be
the one giving you the orgasm. Try this sev-
eral times, with him — or you —— taking
over earlier a little each time. Finally, turn’ the
controls over to him completely. You’ll have
already had several orgasms very nearly
ﬁom him, so you’ll be more comfortable let-
ting go. -

I’m glad you are thinking of bondage or '
other spicy niceties to ﬁx things up, but you

are getting way ahead of yourself. Boyﬁiend
boy laughs such suggestions off because
he’s not ready to go there yet .— and neither-
are you. Bondage shouldn’t be taken lightly.
It’s a complex way of relating sexually that
shouldn’t be entered into by any but the most
trusting partners. Save that for later on.

.You’ve got to crawl before you can walk,

dig? Once you two are churnrny enough to
get curnrny as often as you like, drop me
another line about knots, cats o’ nine tails
and ball gags, oh my.

Melissa Meinzer is hoping for an increase in

the raunch factor of questions. Yitillate her at

American media’s shallow coverage of war in Iraq

With the death of six U.S. soldiers in a downed

can’t or won’t restrain him, and an incensed but unin-

helicopter on Friday, the death toll for this first week of formed public.

November reached thirty-two American casualties in
Iraq. That’s compared to thirty-one in the
whole month of September and forty-two
for October. After the May declaration of
an end to hostilities, American casualties
have risen signiﬁcantly. But don’t worry,
this is just a rebuilding process. Like I
said, the hostilities have ended.

In retaliation, American soldiers blew
up the houses of suspected insurgents in
Iraqi neighborhoods —— key word being
suspected, not proven. We are trying to
instill our own democratic values using
the reckless violence and aggression our
armed men and women are currently risk-
ing their lives to protect us against.

Strangely enough, though, the current bloodshed
doesn’t seem to be a big deal to the media. I never
would have known that on more than one occasion
American troops have ﬁred on and killed unarmed
Iraqi protesters if I hadn’t had a spell of insomnia and

i seen footage about it in some documentary on WQED

at three in the morning. Thirty—two seems like a lot of
people dying, seeing as how it used to take a whole

month or more for that many American soldiers to get '

killed. Yet I read the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette every day
and this is the first time I’ve heard these statistics.
The American media’s coverage of the situation in
Iraq is pretty slack—assed, especially compared to other
countries. This has created a highly dangerous situa-
tion. We have a president who doesn’t think twice
about committing to armed conﬂict, a congress that

    

Seth Steinbacher
Columnist

I believe the average American cares about what’s
happening to our men and women serving
in the Middle East and makes the effort to
read or watch the news in order to stay up
to date. But they aren’t really being told
anything. An anchorperson reads the latest
casualties, they cut to a twenty-second
interview with a soldier or a pissed-off
Iraqi, then something about how dangerous
the area is where the deaths occurred and
how the rest of Iraq is under control except
for the region where more soldiers will get
killed tomorrow. Then Bush makes some
statements about “our” resolution to stay
until the job is done and ﬁnally we’re told
that the reporters have no more informa-
tion at this time and it seems like they never get any
more. ' I

‘So how are we supposed to stay informed when
the major news networks aren’t informing us? There’s
a reason the news always comes on before work, after
dinner, and before bedtime. We watch themajor net-
works because they broadcast when we have the time

to sit down and watch the news. Those of us who don’t .

have cable can’t turn on C—span whenever we get the
chance. Everyone can’t get on the world band radio or
the Internet and get the news from the British
Broadcasting Corp. Whenever real in-depth reporting
occurs it’s always on Charlie Rose or some other hard-

ly-ever-watched program on public television. Old ‘

people and little kids watch public television. We need
this kind of journalism in the more accessible news

that millions of us watch every day.

Our prevailing nationalism isn’t helping us get the
information we need either. Media networks must be
careful not to impinge on the viewing public’s sense of
decency. Show ‘us all the dead Iraqis you want, but
make sure they’re combatants and not innocent civil-
ians. And never, ever show us our "own dead. I’ll admit
I get a weird twist in my stomach whenever I see a
photo of a dead American soldier. The hidden reason
for this is because it’s shocking to see one of our own
be a casualty. We don’t think realistically about our
own human losses because we always win the war. But
our men and women die, just as terribly as the
enemy’s.

The patriotic accolades we give our war dead are
deserved but the fact that the person is dead remains
after the ﬂag is draped over and the coffin is lowered
with salutes Somebody’s mother or somebody’s son is
gone forever, and the loss will always be felt. The
media thinks we cannot handle this kind of informa-
tion. It’s given minimal attention so that it doesn’t
break through our mental ﬁlters and leave an iinprint
on our sensitive consciousness.

As hard as it is to swallow, we need the truth. The ;

American media needs to get much, much more in

depth with" their coverage in ' Iraq. Integrity should .

become more important than commercial viability.

.And journalists should refuse to be afraid of public and
government censure. This is atirne when there needs ‘

to be as much bravery in journalism as there is in our g V

military.

Wal—Mart culpable in “accidental” hiring of -illegal aliens , asjanitorsre

Morally, what’s the difference

 

between actually doing something
wrong and consciously operating in
an unjust system? _

If you want a watch and I tell you
I can get you a brand new one for five
dollars, that's a pretty shady situa-
tion. You’d have to be pretty dull to
not realize that I’m going to have to
steal the watch to get it to you for that
price. So, how is that different from
actually stealing the watch?

On Oct. 3rd, federal agents raided
60 Wal—Marts across 21 states and
arrested over 250 illegal aliens who
were working as janitors in the
stores. Wal—Mart, of course, is
shocked and aghast at the fact that
aliens were being employed to clean
its ﬂoors. And it is true that Wal—Mart
didn’t actually hire these workers.

What they did, and what most
large-scale retailers do, is recognize
that they need their stores to be clean,
so they open up bidding to janitorial
contractors to see who can do it
cheapest. Let’s say that the most effi-
cient — and legal — ﬁrm needs $15
per employee after taxes, social secu-
rity, health benefits, etc. to do the ser-
vice. The lowest bid, however, might
be $10 — a shady situation. The con-
tract goes to the $10 contractor, who

says nothing illegal is going on, and
that contractor then hires a subcon-
tractor who makes similar assurances
and actually hires the workers.

The retail business has two
degrees of legal separation “between
itself andthe janitors that are clean-
ing its floors, so that when the
employees are discovered
as illegal aliens, working
seven nights a week with-
out overtime pay or health
benefits of any kind, the
retail business can claim
ignorance to the whole
thing. They were simply
looking out for their bot-,
tom dollar. Their contrac-
tor assured them that they
would only hire legal
workers. It’s not the busi-
ness’s responsibility to
research that claim. Who
are they to question the claims of a
firm that they know nothing about?

But, in the case of Wal—Mart, the
argument of ignorance and good faith
in contractors loses a good bit of
weight when it’s realized that similar
raids in 1998 and 2001 rounded up
102 illegal immigrants working at
Wal—Mart, according to The New
York Times.

Getting Pitt students out of their rooms since 1905

PAGE 12

Another Mexican restaurant on Forbes

Baja Fresh
3615 Forbes Ave.

(412) 687-7700
‘ﬁﬁvk

What is it with the Mexican
restaurants in Oakland lately? I’m
sure you’ve been asking yourself the
same question. Forget Taco Bell —
authentic Mexican food seems to be
pretty popular on Pitt’s campus.

Not only does Taco Bell have to
worry about competition from
Qdoba, the efficient fast food
Mexican grill that showed up last
year, but they’ve got to watch out for
Baja Fresh, the latest arrival to come
to Forbes Avenue.

With a menu that ranges from
burritos and enchiladas to taquitos,
Baja Fresh brings even more
Mexican ﬂavor to campus.

A little more expensive than a
Taco Bell dish, you’ll get more filled
up with their entrees. The question
then is: Is your break between class-
es worth it?

Perhaps, if you have seven to
nine minutes to spare after waiting in
their line of curious new customers.
After all, the sign that is posted on
their bright white wall says, “Food
cannot be made at microwave
speed.” At least Baja Fresh is honest
—— though I think the employee lied
when I was told the maximum wait
was nine minutes. Perhaps it was that
my anticipation got the best of me.

With my few extra minutes tick-
ing by, I took notice of several things
about Baja Fresh. First, the paint job
that hits you as soon as you walk .in
really starts playing tricks with your
mind. It’s whiter than a Crest
whitening strip bleach job. Add to

that the beaming lights in every inch
of the room, and you might get a lit-
tle woozy before mealtime.

Meanwhile, walking back with full
hands this time, after running into
only one couple, I had my eye on the

pop up in Oakland in recent months.

As I looked down at the table to
focus on something else, and lis-
tened to the Mexican music, my
number was called. Alert and starv-
ing by this time, I found the journey
to obtain my food quite a struggle
because of the traffic ﬂow. I’m not
going to give Baja a hard time,
though. This is only the first couple
weeks. Things may change.

RACHEL COUP/CONTRIBUTING EDITOR

Jeff Hopper (back) and Rob Pinger eat a meal at Baja Fresh, the newest Mexican restaurant to

s

prize: the salsa bar. A

Made fresh daily, the salsa bar is
a stand with nearly every type of
mild to hot salsa‘: salsa Verde, pico de
ga1lo,.and their enchilado salsa. The
dizziness ended while my mind
raced to figure out which salsa I
should use on my chicken taquito.

Heck, why not try all of them?

And when I bit into my chicken

taquito, you can imagine that I was a

little bit excited and overjoyed at the ’

same time. I’ll tell you this much,
the food was. good,
but if you’re going to
have to wait up to 10
minutes
numbered ticket, you
should at least have a
server coming to your
table with your tacos.
Perhaps this is price
you pay for fresh.-
ness.
_ Fresh seems
to be Baja Fresh’s
major selling point.
Maybe 'it’s their ver-

Subway. I’m sure
Jared is getting tired
of eating ‘fresh at
Subway seven days a
week. I’m not sure

works out in compar-
' ison to a six-inch sub
and a bag of Baked
Lays, though. -
Your refill-
able jumbo-size sou-
venir cup makes
everything worth it
even» the wait.
However, maybe not
the embarrassment you’ll face from
McDonald’s patrons across the street
when you exit. Since the cup is
rather big, there is. no possible way
to camouﬂage your affection for
Baja Fresh. Sipping from your straw,
you’re practically a walking bumper
sticker. The food‘ was great, but
maybe not enough for me to wish to
hold my cup up high.

Hip—Hop heavyweight Russell Simmons spends an evening at Pitt

You name it, he’s done it. He
practically created hip-hop culture
as we know it today. And tonight,
you can‘ spend the evening with him
as Pitt Program Council presents:
An Evening with Russell Simmons.

Simmons, born in 1957, is a
hip-hop legend in his own time. He
is co-creator of Def Jam Recording
Company and owns Rush
Communications. He has put his
money behind movies, music and
the production of music videos,

clothing lines, television shows and
philanthropic efforts. The sum of
his empire rings to the tune of $250
million dollars.

Raised in Queens, NY, it is
believed he learned his business
savvy I on the streets. He was
involved in street gangs and most of
the parts of urban life that many of
the artists on his label sing about.
What changed his direction was
observing free—style rapping on the
street corners and how it influenced

young black males in his_ area. He
immediately spent most of his time
promoting independent black rap-
pers.

The start of this fame was his-

decision to co-found __Def Jam
Recording Co. in 1984 with Rick
Rubin. His label started the careers
of such ‘legends as Run D.M.C.,
L.L. Cool J and the Beastie Boys.
Today, his label carries such artists
as Jay—Z, DMX and Method Man.
He is also credited with the success-

ful combination of the rap-rock
genres by mixing Run-D.M.C. with

Aerosmith for the successful re—mix -

of “Walk this Way,” and inspiring

such artists as Limp Bizkit, .Kid'

Rock and Linkin Park.

Simmons went on to b.ecome
CEO of Rush Artist Management
and Rush Communications.
Through that, he started a success-
ful comedy show, Def Comedy Jam,

IRS is on the scene trying to col-

Internal Revenue Service — it is a
new hip-hop group. IRS is not out to
collect your money; it’s out to col-
lect some respect — which the. mem-

Lesson one: the group’s name isv
not pronounced “I—R-S,” but “ERZ.” ’

Now you’re well on your way to

“Lift Off,” the first song on the

“We Don’t Play’’ is the highlight I

ﬂirt} t .

On May 3, 2003, during the New
Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival, a
six—hour marathon concert, took place
at the Saenger Theater. It was record-
ed and taped for a CD/DVD, The
Deepest End: Live in Concert, and
the package is more than worth any
dollar amount you may have to fork
oven

Gov’t Mule, with the help of
numerous guest musicians, performed
a show that needed to be recorded so
it could be enjoyed countless times.

Gov’t Mule had the help of 13
different bass players, including Les
Claypool (Primus, Frog Brigade),
Ozzy
Osbourne), Mike Gordon (Phish),
Dave Schools (Widespread Panic)
and Victor Wooten (Bela Fleck and
the Flecktones), who were all in New
Orleans for the festival or ﬂew in for
the special concert.

Gov’t Mule set out to perform
this concert as a tribute to original
bassist Allen Woody, who passed

Swimmg wi Gov’t

Mule

away in August of 2000.

The concert was performed on a
whim; they were constantly changing
the set list to work with artists that
were available for the different songs.
Some were running late because of
their own shows and some were even
early. The entire concert was almost
completely improvised, as there was
very little rehearsal time. ‘

The musicians were under a lot of
pressure to play their best on each
song, and they prevailed on each
track, as they broke into extended
jams, pushing the songs past the 10-
minute mark in some instances. When
that happens you can see the connec-
tion they are making: That the band is
up there giving it their all and having
a good time with it.

The Deepest End: Live in Concert
makes for an incredible package of
musical talent; the Mule didn’t leave
any song off of the list, including
favorites like “Sco—Mule,” “Goin’
Down,” Bad Little Doggie” and
“Blindman in the Dark.” It would be
difficult to avoid finding a favorite
Mule song on this album, and watch-
ing the DVD brings you there ———
almost. _

Off the wire:“Development” gives rest from mundane

BRIAN WOLLY
Tufts Daily (Tufts U.)

(U-WIRE) MEDFORD, Mass. —
There’s quirky, there’s goofy, and
there’s just plain bizarre. Then
there is “Arrested Development,”
a hilarious and original amalgam
of all three adjectives and then
some. In some parts “Malcolm and
the Middle”, and others a modiﬁed
television version of “The Royal
Tenenbaums,” this new FOX com-
edy brings the dysfunctional to
life, proclaiming that nothing is
sacred in the family unit.

Told through the eyes of

Michael Bluth (Jason Batemen), ,

“Arrested Development’? is all

. about his family, a ridiculous col-

lection of caricatures. who some-
how manage to coexist in the frac-
tured world of television. At the

« top of the family is George Bluth,

Sr. (Jeffrey Tambor), a spendthrift

and grandstanding ‘real estate.

mogul who has ‘recently bestowed
the family empire upon his vapid,

yet fashionable, wife Lucille A

(Jessica Walter), much to the cha-

 of the hardworking and loyal

Michael. Unloved and underap-
preciated, Michael lives in the attic

‘of a model home with his socially

awkward prepubescent son
George Michael (Michael Cera),
waiting for his chance to ﬁnally
make it big in his father’s compa-
ny.
But his father’s ﬁnancial care-
lessness does not go unpunished,
as a celebratory banquet cruise is
crashed by the FBI, SEC, and IRS,
all ready to pounce on George Sr.
for countless violations of many
federal laws‘. Now, without their
father’s piggy bank, the rest of the
family must cope with its new-
found helplessness while Michael
looks on in disgust and embarrass-
ment. Leading the crowd of sib-
lings is Portia de Rossi as the ﬂarn—
boyant activist Lindsay. Though
she’s hounded from the beginning
by the Jewish Defense League for
creating HOOP .(I-Iands Off Our
Penises), -a group ﬁghting against
circumcision, Lindsay develops an
even greater headache when her
hotel penthouse, paid" ' for by
Daddy’s expense account, is ‘no
more. ‘ '
Michael’s two other brothers,
George 1]] (Will Amett) and
Buster (Tony Hale), are equally
inept. The former is a failed magi-

“cian, blackballed by his former
I associates for mistakenly revealing I

    

the trick behind one of his illu-
sions, and the latter has wasted his
father’s money learning about
ancient skills and cultures, though
he knows nothing about everyday
modern life. Even Buster’s lessons
in cartography fail to serve him
well, as when the family attempts
to ﬂee the federal agents, he looks
at the map and claims that “this
blue area here is land.”

In the end, it’s the simple ran-
domness and quirky behavior of

2 all the Bluths that will drive this

show to its ultimate success.
Whereas the dry humor of . “The
Royal Tenenbaums” singled out
the extraordinary eccentricity of its
family, “Arrested” prides itself on
the underwhelming pathos of the
Bluths. When George Senior’s

accounts are frozen, the family
must move in together in the only .
-vestige left of his real- estate

empire. The humorous conceit of

“Arrested” should’ center. on (the
‘loony and ‘wacky -behavior of-1 this ’

similarly characterized family.

Hurwitz (“'Ihe Ellen Show”) has

designed a "beautifully fractured -

grown-up American family. If Malcolm
and his brothers grew up rich, this would
be their adult life. Hurwitz’s brilliant
script is exceptionally realized by the
fantastic cast that producers Ron Howard
and Brian Grazer have assembled.

As the narrator and focus upon
which all the other skewed familial lines
meet, Batemen is perfect in his role as

» Michael Bluth. His role is probably the

simplest, as he is the straight, sane man to
his kooky siblings and parents. Even his
son, played with the right amount of sub-

tlety by the young Cera, outshines '

Batemen when he anxiously awaits
rooming, with his attractive adolescent

cousin.

As the father ﬁgure, Tarnbor places a
loveable face on the Kenneth. Lays and
Bernard Ebbers of the world. His ability

to ﬁll the broad shoulders of such a false-'

ly magnanimous character comes across
in George Senior’s carefree behavior.

The actors who play his children are
also well-cast, especially de Rossi (“Ally
McBeal”). Initially portrayed as a spoiled
brat with little to do but support frivolous
causes like HOOP, Lindsey still harbors a
deep love and admiration of her brother,
the sort that is usually found in cheesy
afternoon sitcoms.

Her husband, former doctor Tobias
Funke (former because he attempted
CPR on a sleeping tourist) is played by

perennial sitcom guest star staple David
Cross. Recognizable from his roles on
“The Drew Carey Show” and “Just Shoot
Me!,” Cross steals each scene he is in
with his natural and infectious good-
humored gooﬁness.

“Arrested Development” is the tri-
umphant culmination of the recent trend
of dysfunctionality in television families.
The Bluths follow in the footsteps of the
most well known modern and cliched
“dysfunctional family,” the Simpsons,
while combining their charm with con-
temporary cynicism and quirkiness. The
Tenenbaums may have had extraordinary
academic or physical skills, but the
Bluths are mediocre in everything but
their eccentricity.

Most of the crowd at Heinz Field on
Saturday was looking for the fade pattern
to wideout Larry Fitzgerald with third
and goal on the Virginia Tech two-yard
line and 54 seconds left in the game, but
it was fullback Lousaka Polite who
pounded the ball in for the winning
touchdown and the 31-28 victory over the
No. 5 Hokies.

“I wanted Lousaka Polite to score,”
head coach Walt Harris said. “I thought
he had the best chance to get it in [the end
zone] .”

Polite powered his way, dragging
Hokie inside linebacker Vegas Robinson,
across the goal line to give Pitt (7-2 over-
all, 4-O Big East) the lead with 47 seconds
left.

“It was a great feeling. I felt like I
owed [the team] that,” Polite said, refer-
ring to an earlier play, inwhich he fum-
bled the ball.

Virginia Tech (7-2, 3-2) still had one
last‘ chance to drive down ﬁeld to tie or
win the game, but it was quickly squan-
dered when quarterback Marcus Vick
threw a pass right into the hands of free

On the game-winning drive, Pitt
quarterback Rod Rutherford hooked up
with Fitzgerald on three passes for a total
of 49 yards.

Pitt took over after Virginia Tech
made the decision to go for the ﬁrst down
on fourth—and-four at the Pitt 30-yard
line. Vick threw a pass out of the reach of
wide receiver‘ Justin Hamilton. A first
down would have allowed the Hokies to
run the clock down.

Instead, Pitt saw a win 70 yards
away.

8 On the first play, Rutherford dropped
back to pass and ran out of the pocket to
his right. As he neared the line of scrim-
mage, he ﬁred a 28-yard pass into the
hands of Fitzgerald. Rutherford found
Fitzgerald again on the next play for a’

gain of 12 yards to the Virginia Tech 30- _

yard line.

With a 12-yard scramble by
Rutherford and a 9-yard pass to
Fitzgerald, Pitt set up at the 9-yard line.

the ball to the 2-yard line, where Polite
would put the ball in the end zone on

almost as if there was no
defense, the Panther
defense was key in the 31- T

Jones hit up Pitt’s

Tech’s touchdowns- Despite this blemish, Pitt’s
defense came up with some big plays.

The Panther defense was able to take advantage of i

a freshman quarterback. Twice Pitt was able to inter-

cept Marcus Vick. Lewis Moore intercepted Vick right,

before the end of the first half and Vick’s last inter-
ception was made by safety Corey Humphries put the
‘ﬁnal nail in the Hokies’ coffin.

Virginia Tech head coach Frank Beamer wanted to

’ roll the dice, but made an unwise decision by playing

an inexperienced quarterback for the majority of a

Panthers clinch tournament spot

DAVID SHEAROUSE
Staff Writer

' Despite clinching a berth in the Big East
Tournament for the first time in three years, the
Pitt volleyball team struggled in defeating West
Virginia 3-0 on Friday night at Fitzgerald Field
House. Q '

According to head coach.Chris Beerman,
the Panthers played an ‘uninspired match
against a significantly less talented
Mountaineer (6-19 overall, 2-8 Big East)
squad. '

“As a whole, we just didn’t play well,”
Beerman said."‘[The team] just seemed like
they just. wanted to play at West Virginia’s level
and they seemed happy about it, which really
was the most disappointing thing for me.”

In the first game, Pitt sprinted out to an
early 4-0 lead before watching West Virginia
come back to run off six consecutive points to
take a two—point ‘advantage at 12-10. The
Panthers rallied to tie the game at 15 on the way
to winning the first game by the score of 30-22.

The second game of the match ‘saw yet
another Mountaineer run, as West Virginia
recovered from a two—point deficit to take a
three—point lead at 14-11. Pitt used an ace by
middle hitter April Puzauskas to tie the score at
15 and won the second game by the score of 30-
25.

“[West Virginia’s]i runs were caused by our
errors and lack of focus,” Beerman-said. “We
hit a lot of balls out of bounds and we just
played a very poor match.” 0

The Panthers started the third game of the
match with a six-point run that featured an ace
by outside hitter Abby Fechhelm. Pitt never
looked back as it rolled to a 30-23 victory over
the Mountaineers.

“Abby had a good game,” Beerman said.
“She came out and had a better week of practice
and did a lot of nice things.”

As a team, the Panthers combined for 38
kills, 12.5 blocks and six aces. Individually,
Pitt was led by outside hitter Wendy Hatlestad,
who finished the match with 14 kills, seven
digs and five blocks. Middle hitter Megan
Miller added 12 kills and three blocks while
libero Megan McGrane contributed 16 digs for
Pitt.

With the victory, the Panthers improved
their record to 20-4 and 9-1 in the Big East
play. Additionally, the win also gives Beerman
his third 20—win season in four years.

Beerman believes that his team played very
tentatively and displayed a complete lack of
focus that must be corrected immediately.

“This is the time you really want to step it
up and play your best ball at the end of the
year,” Beerman said.

Pitt’s next match will be against Syracuse
next weekend at Fitzgerald Field House. T

“[Our] next match is Syracuse, a very good
team, a very physical team, ateam that is going
to be very confident,” Beerman said. “And we
have to fix this tentative thing right now or that
is going to be a tough match for us. A.

T .- “We’re going to have a hard week of prac-
tice and we‘ need to change our mindset.”

Win, page 18

perfectly into his hands for the go—ahead touchdown.
The touchdown extended Fitzgerald’s record streak to
15 consecutive games with a touchdown.

Jones again led Virginia Tech into the end zone on
the ensuing drive. The eight-play, 75-yard drive, capped
off by a l—yard touchdown rim by Jones, put Virginia
Tech up 14-10 with 8:33 left in the second quarter.

After a Panther punt, Virginia Tech’s offense looked
to start another scoring drive at its own 29-yard line. On

‘rimning back Cedric Humes’s only carry of the game,

nose tackle Charles Spencer forced a fumble, allowing
Pitt to take over at the Virginia Tech 33-yard line.

After three plays, Pitt had only gained two yards and
faced fourth-and-eight on the 31-yard line. Harris opted
to go for the ﬁrst down rather than kicking a ﬁeld goal.
Not only did he take the risk of going for the ﬁrst down,
he took the risk of running an option play.

Rutherford ﬂipped the ball back to running back
Jawan Walker, who ran for 27 yards to the 2-yard line.
Rutherford would ﬁnish the drive with a quarterback
sneak to put Pitt up 17-14.

Pitt would miss a golden opportunity to take a 10-
point lead at the half. Lewis Moore intercepted a pass
from Vick giving Pitt the ball at the Hokie 41-yard line.
After a few run plays, Rutherford threw a 10-yard strike
to tight end Kris Wilson, placing Pitt on the Hokie 19-
yard line with 48 seconds left.

Rutherford would go right back to Wilson on the
next play. The pass bounced in and out of Wilson’s
hands and Hokie linebacker Mikal Baaqee intercepted it.

On the Panthers’ second possession of the third 5

quarter, Rutherford moved the baH 80 yards, ﬁnishing

the nine—play drive with a
touchdown pass to a wide
open Wﬂson.

The Hokies would 5
again counter when Jones .
ran 80 yards to cut the Pitt
lead to 24-21. Defensive
end Claude Haniott and
comerback Shawntae
Spencer both bit on an end
around fake creating a
huge hole for Jones to run
through.

‘ Pitt would go three-
and-out on offense and
Virginia Tech would only
take two plays to go ahead
of the Panthers, 28-24,
with 13:51 remaining in
the fourth quarter. '

After wide receiver
Ernest Wilford caught a
46-yard pass from Vick,
Jones broke through the
front line and ran 13 yards.
for his fourth touchdown
of the day. '

Jones ﬁnished the day with 241 yards on 30 carries,
averaging eight yards a carry.

The Pitt defense allowed the big runs all day, but it
kept the Virginia Tech air attack to only 186 yards. The
Hokies were also four-of-11 on third downs and did not
convert on a critical fourth down play late in the game.

the senior quarterback went back to

-Fitzgerald, this time for a gain of

nine to the Hokies’ 9-yard line.

From there, Rutherford handed
off to fullback Lousaka Polite on
three of the next four plays and
Polite found the end zone to culmi-
nate the fourth quarter comeback.

“I thought that was the best way
for us to score and it was all
Lousaka,” Harris said. “He got hit
quick and he is so strong...I thought
he had the best chance to get in
there.”

The win was the Panthers’ third
consecutive over Virginia Tech and,
for the second‘ year in a row, Pitt
erased any chance the Hokies had for
a national title

But Rutherford knows that this
win will help the next time Pitt is in
this situation. .

“It’s definitely going to boost our
confidence,” he said about the drive.
“Just about every two—minute drive
that we’ve had in the last two years,
we had a chance to win. We knew

that going into that situation, we had
a little experience at it and we just
had to go out there and execute.”
While many expected Fitzgerald
to play an enormous role in the win,
it was Rutherford who executed the
Panthers’ offense to nearperfection.
Rutherford completed 24 of his
31 pass attempts for 303 yards —— his
fifth 300-yard passing game of the
season — and two touchdowns.
Seven different players caught a pass

and, on one drive in the third quarter, V

Rutherford found three different

receivers on three consecutive pass ,

plays.

“I think the ﬁrst part of this
game, he was really fired up and I
think he was too fired up. He was
trying to run everybody over,” Harris
said. “Two different times during the
game I saw him, instead’ of trying to
avoid somebody, he tried to run them
over. He’s such a tough, hard-nosed
football player. . .

“He grew up “during this game’
and went back to executing our sys-
tem,’.’ Harris added, “which I think
he did tremendously.” -

Another key to the Panthers’ victo-
ry came on fourth and four with
approximately four minutes left in the
game, when comer back William

‘ “Tutu”’ Ferguson was able to keep up

with Virginia Tech wide receiver Justin
Hamilton ——- who had beaten Ferguson
earlier in the fourth quarter on a deep

-route —- just enough to cause Vick to

have to place the ball perfectly in order
for the pass to becompleted.

Vick‘ overshot Hamilton, which
gave the ball back to Pitt before its win-
ning touchdown drive. The Panther
defense was unable to stop Jones, who

' ‘made them look absolutely atrocious on

several of his rushes, but they were able
to force Vick to make some plays with
his arm and he wasn’t able to deliver.

Vick finished the game with eight
completions on 15 attempts for 147
yards. In order for Pitt to fmish its -sea-
son on script, the Panthers are going to
have to be able to force quarterbacks to
beat them through the air.

Opposing teams’ passing attacks
have not been problematic for Pitt this
season; with the exception of Toledo,
the problems have been on the ground.

clamp down on opponents in passing

situations. I

Also down the stretch, Lousaka '

Polite needs 12-15 rushes per game.
The man is a beast! He rushed for 42
yards on ‘nine carries, which is an aver-
age of 4.7 yards. On Polite’s game-Win-
ning touchdown run, he was stood up at
about the 3—yard line, but Polite kept
driving his legs until he crossed the
goal line.‘ -

Until running back Brandon Miree

is available, this may be the best way to
go. Defenses can’t seem to bring
down on the first or second hit. Use this
to your advantage, Walt Harris. He not
only can run in between the tackles, but
he also can catch the ball out of the
backﬁeld, which forces defenses to
have to tackle him in the open ﬁeld.
The keys for the remainder of the
season are: show" up against West
Virginia next weekend, force opposing

"quarterbacks to beat the defense
. through the air, and give Polite more

touches.
