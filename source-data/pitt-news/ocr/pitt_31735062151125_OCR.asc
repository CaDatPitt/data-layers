Evening Style Show

Becomes Social Affair

Tumpson Revamps Ancient
Ceremony, Introduces
High Class Stuff

By Bob ‘Saffron

It had been rumored that The Pitt
News style show and dance was no
more.

That is a vile innuendo.

According to Sidney Tumpson,
BA39, co-advertising manager of The
News, whose face appears elsewhere,
the style parade will be continued on
April 23—in the evening.

The evening showing of spring
styles for men and women is a inno-
vation of Mr. Tumpson’s, the affairs
in the past, being free to the public
because of The News’ goodness of

heart, having “lacked dignity,” he
said.
Therefore, the dance and style

show combination will be held in the
ballroom of the Twentieth Century
Club. And one dollar will be the ad-
mission c h a r g e . Well-informed
sources disclose that no more than
250 tickets will be printed.

Student modelsrwill be picked by
a committee composed of faculty,
students, and Pittsburgh style author-
ities. Twenty-ﬁve men and 25 women
will be nominated by a campus bal-
lot, and of these a total of twenty
will be selected as the models by the
committee. Said Tumpson:

“The balloting this year will be on
the legitimate. Absolutely.”

Fashion Commentator

Ballots will appear on Wednesday,
April 7, and on Friday, April 9. One
person will vote only once. .S0111'CeS
close to ofﬁcial sources believe that
the models, who will be given the
once-over by the downtown fashion
experts, may have the opportunity to
model for the department stores pro-
fessionally.

At any rate, Miss Bernice Cham--
bers, of the Retail Training Bureau,
has consented to comment upon the
men’s and women’s fashions as they
are displayed in the style show. The
men’s suits come from Fintex, and
the shoes from Laird’s. Women's
gowns are presented by courtesy of
the Larry Kaye Shop, and women’s
shoes by Wise.

The Style Show committee, headed
by Tumpson and consisting mainly of
Pitt News staff members, will circu-
"late tickets soon.

Larry Funk Plays
For Panhel Ball,

L e a die r Reveals

 

Larry Funk and his orchestra, just
as predic'ted in Pittpourri, will play
for the annual Panhellenic Ball,
April 16, at the Urban Room of
Hotel William Penn. ‘ -

His hand is well known throughout
New England and has played for
proms at Harvard, Yale and Prince-
ton. Not so many years ago, Mr.
Funk’s band was known as “the Band
of a Thousand Melodies” and played
daily over the red and blue networks
of the National Broadcasting Com-
pany.

Marion Messer, Ed37, vice-presi-
dent and social chairman of Pan-
hellenic Council, is chairman of the

Ball. It is a closed dance for fra-
ternity women and their invited
escorts.

The tickets are now on sale and
may be obtained from the Panhellenic
representatives of each fraternity.
The ‘assessment this year is three
dollars. A quota of three-fourths of
the active members must be ﬁlled by
each group.

Assisting Miss Messer in her plans
is her regular social committee, con-
sisting of Sylvia Briggs, C39; Ruth
Greene, C37; and Lucille Uptegrail’,
C39.

Freshman Women Edit
Fifth News Publication

Freshman publications women
will emulate their elders this next
week. The ﬁfth annual freshman
paper will be edited by the publi-
cations unit next Thursday a't their
Mothers’ Tea.

The paper will be printed in imi-
tation, and try to be an improve-
ment, of the Pitt News style. It will
be a four page, four column issue
containing news of the freshman
women and their activi'ties, and as a
whole, will serve as a review of the
year’s work.

This edition is produced entirely
by the freshman women. The work
will be directed by Mary Lou Per-
ring as editor. She has appointed
reporters, and on Friday will an-
nounce her staff.

 

Sorority Holds Dance

Delta chapter of the Lambda Kap-
pa Sigma, national pharmaceutical
sorority, will hold its annual Spring
Swing at the Hotel Webster Hall on
April 14. Lambda Kappa Sigma is
composed of thewomen members of
the College of Pharmacy. -

Brother Act

 

SlDl‘lEY TUMPSON

HO carries on the tradition set

by brother Ellis Tumpson,
BA36, for sponsoring something
new and different in the way of
Pitt News Style Shows. Started by
brother Ellis as an afternoon affair,
this year the show is bigger and
better as an evening entertainment
at the Twentieth Century Club.

For South

Siegal, Springer, McKenna,
Lehman, Murphy Make
Trip to VVinthrop

A University delegation of six per-
sons will leave tomorrow for Rock
Hill, South Carolina, where they will
compete with debaters from more

same question will be argued by Leh-
man and lVi[cKenna.

Murphy will take part in an ora-
torical contest. He will deliver a dis-
cussion of the war problem entitled
“Shall VVG Ever Rise?”

The tournament is under the spon-
sorship of the “Society of the Straw
berry Leaf,” a national organization
to promote management of public af-
fairs among college students.

Some of the schools that are ex-
pected to send representatives are
University of Florida, Mississippi Col-
lege for Women, University of Geor-
gia, University of Cincinnati, Ford-
ham University, Waynesburg College,
University of Maryland, Toledo Uni-

Editorial Meeting
There will be a meeting of The
News Editorial Staff today at 3:30
o’clock in The News oﬁice, Room 809,
Cathedral. Attendance is compulsory.

City Panhel
To Present

Cup Award

Women’s Fraternity Group
To Make Presentation
At Mass Meeting

A scholarship cup, the annual
award of City Panhellenic Associa-
tion, will be presentecl to the wom-
an’s fraternity with llighest scholastii‘
rating for the past year at a mass
meeting for all f1‘ate1‘nity women at
12:30 o’clock today in Heinz House.

Miss Sara Dixon, a representative
of City Pauhellenic, will make the
presentation. Miss Thyrsa W. Amos.
dean of women and a membe1' of ‘the
wo_me_n’;: frato1‘nit._v committee, will
either review “'l'ova1'icl1” or speak on
the “Charleston Gardens.”

Each f1'a't:e1‘nity has submitted a list
of scholastic ratings and these have
been checked and arranged accord-
ing to scholastic standing by the reg-
istrar's office. After the presentation
of the scholarsliip cup, the list will
be announced.

New Cup Presented

One scholarship cup is now in the
permanent possession of Beta Phi
Alpha, who had the lligl-iest scholastic
rating in 1933, 1934, and 1935. Last
year the new gold cup was presented
to Zeta Tau Alpha.

A representative fron1 each frater-
nity will be called upon to report the
number and percentage of her group
at the meeting. Panhellenic is trying
‘through these mass meeting to
create more friendly spirit and bet-
ter undcrstanding between the wom-
en's fraternities on campus.

Mildred Corbin, Ed37, of Panhel-
lcnic Council is in charge of the mass
meetings.

Political Meeting
To Feature Fight
For Speakership

A behind--tlie-scenes ﬁght for the
speal«:e1'-sliip of the lntercollegiate
Conference on Government will con-
front delcgates to the three-day ses-
sion, scheduled to begin on Friday in
the legislative halls at I1la.1‘1‘isburg.

For the first time in the liistory
of the four-year-old conference, a
per1nanent chairman will be chosen
by the delegates from a list of candi-
dates selected by an executive com-
mittee from applicants of every col--
logo and university represented.

One member of each delegation will
be nominated to appear before the
executive committee, which will
choose four candidates to be elected
from the ﬂoor.

In past years. Genevieve Blatt,
C34, and John Bracken, 334, foun-
ders of the conference, have con-
ducted the meetings. Last year, when
Miss Blatt contracted laryngitis, a
temporary chairman was selected
from the floor.

While the University group is rush-
ing work on its material for the meet-
ing, the regular sessions of the state
legis_lature at Harrisburg were draw-
ing to a close. They will probably be
concluded Wednesday afternoon or
Thursday mornin;_:f, leaving a day for
the legislative halls to be readied be
‘fore the estimated 300 college stu-
dents lll\-’:;1(lC them.

Miss T-ia*..‘., now a graduate assis-
tant in polit.ical science at the Uni-
versity, said Saturday that it ap-
peared probable that the Columbia
B1'oadcasl:ing System would carry a
description of the opening session of
the “model legislature” on Friday
morning. Other sessions of the meet-
ings will be carried by Harrisburg

stations.

News Applicants Only
For Early Quizzes

 

Selections for the editor and busi-
ness manager of The Pitt News will
be '1nude through interviews with the
Publications Board on l\.'lo11da_v a.nd
'I‘uesday morliings, April 12 and 13.

Because of the crowded schedule of
activities’ trips, Cap and Gown, and
Spring Festival, the Board will select
next year’s executives for only the
paper at this time. Editors of the
Panther, the Owl, the Journeyman,
and the Compass will be chosen later.

Board To Do Interviewing

Principal reason for the early se-
lection of The News oiiicials given by
fl1eodo1'e W. Biddle, assistant dean
of men and a moznber of the board,
was that the 119w ‘heads would need
the help and gulcling hands of the
retiring editor and business manager
in order to gain experience for the
coming year. In other publications,
this ex.pe1'ience will not be needed un-
til next year.

Candidates interested in the two
positions will be interviewed by the
Publications Board, which is com-
posed of Miss Thyrsa W. Amos, dean
of women, Dr. Vincent W. Lanfear,
dean of men, Mr. Biddle, and Robert
K. Graham. director of the University
News Service and instructor in jour-
nalism.

Precedent Breaking

Interviews will be held next Mon-
day from 10 to 11:30 o’clock, and
on ’l_‘uesda.y, April 13, from 9 to 10 :30
o’clock. Applicants who cannot be
seen at these times may meet the
loard on Monday, April 19, from 10
to 11:30 o’clock. Excuses will be
granted from any classes missed by
the applicants. Positively no after-
noon appointments will be given. Ap-
pointments for the interviews may be
made with Miss Beatty in the dean
of men’s ofﬁce, Room 801, Cathedral,
any day this week.

The interviews this year are prece-
dent-breaking in that they are sched-
uled nearly a month earlier than us-
ual, and that the heads of only The
News will be selected at this time.
Previously, the custom has been to
select the heads of all publications
during the month of May.

Business Gain Noted
By Research Bureau

 

“The gain in business during the
past two years has been somewhat
more than 50 per cent, exceptional
recovery in the iron and steel indus-
try being‘ chieﬂy respomxilile for the
marked improvement." This was the
gist of a report on Pittsburgh busi-
ness conditions given out by the Uni-
versity’s Bureau of Business Re-
search.

Early French Movies

To Be Run Thursday

Thursday night in Frick Auditor-
ium, the department of ﬁne arts will
show the first of two programs of
motion pictures representative of the
rise of the ﬁlm in France.

The movies will comprise the
fourth program in the new series of
foreign ﬁlms loaned to the Univer-
.-'l'l.y by the Museum of Modern Art
Film Librar_v.

Iiutitled “From l.umicre to Reno
Clair,” the group of ﬁlms dates from
the lirst French motion pictures pro-
duced by Louis Lumiere and his
brother Auguste in .1805 to a surreal-
ist interpretation of a funeral pro-
cession by Rene Clair.

Early “chase” ﬁlms are represented
by “The Runaway Horse,” produced
in 1907 by Pathe. The audience
aliases the horse through city streets.

At about this time, producers were

trying to elevate the cinema from
“peep-shows” to reﬁned entertain-
ment. Mack Sennett used these chase
films as models for his early comedies.

“Fantomas,” the widely-circulated
-serial of 1913, will be shown in part.
European audiences were as thrilled
by its melodrama as American audi-
ences were by the contemporary
“I’e1‘ils of Pauline.”

Rene Clair, who will be remem-
hered for his subtle atmosphere in
Robert Donat’s recent “The ‘Ghost
Goes West,” broke away from the
formalism of the period and intro-
duced wild, dream-lil~:e movies. His
"‘Entr’Acte” will conclude the pro-
gram.

The performance will begin at 8:15
o’clock. For those who do not have
subscription tickets, special tickets
will be on sale at the door for 25
cents each.

 A Early Interviews

ODAY’S PITT NEWS carries at the top of
Page one an announcement from the Univer-
sity Publications Board to the effect that the date
" for interviews for choosing heads _of The Pitt
News has been moved up from the middle of May
to April twelfth, thirteenth and nineteenth.

The Editorial Boai'd=of The News believes that

‘ a discussion of this “precedent-breaking” action

is not only desirablebut a duty. The Un_iver.sity
student body is entitled to know the implications
of this action. and it is the responsibility of The
Pitt News to see that they do. '. _ _ _
Movingthe date for the interviews is signiﬁ-
’cent for several reasons. The Board at the ‘April
meetings plans to interview only thecandidates
for the editor and the businessinanagc-_r of The
Pitt News. It has been customary t9 1l‘1t€1'V1€W
candidates for all student publications at the
same time.  _ .
. Moving up the dateof the interviews of Pitt
News candidates would not in itself be an object
of concern except for the fact that there has
not been an harmonious outlook on policy be-
tween the Editorial Board of The News and the
Publications Board. ;

Possibly the Board’s statement that, due to the
press of duties in May, it has been forced to move
up the date of the interviews, has.a real M515
in fact. There is certainly evidence in last year s

' situation which would support such a stand; for,

theAB_oard worked’ overtime last May togive each‘
candid:-i_te.a chance to state his views. Holwever,
even if this is true, the Board, in view of t e mis-

_ iinderstandings that have arisen thisyear, shoiuld
_ have avoided a chance to deepen that misun er-

standing. It would, therefore, have been better.
that the interviews be held in May, as is the
iisiia.l procedure.

The Board also states that another reason for _

moving up the date is to give the new heads of
the newspaper a chance to gain experience under
the guiding hands of the present-editor and__busi-.
ness manager. This reason, intentionally or not.
ignores the facts in the case. Those candidates
who ought to be seriously considered for these
positions stand in no need of this training period.
They are capable of putting out the paper at its
present standard and have been so qualiﬁed for
quite some tim-e. Again, it has always been the
custom at the University for the new editor and
business manager to assume active directioii of
the paper only with the last issue.  _ -

Behind all the above lies another consideration.
The Editorial Board of The News cannot help
but remember the letter it received which re-
cently criticized the present policy of The News
and declared that if the policy were not changed,
a recommendation would be made to the Publica-
tions Board that The News be, either reduced to
a "weekly status” or that it be made “a laboratory
for journalism students.”

At the time we interpreted this as a threat of
censorship and we have had no reason since to
change ourpminds. If. we are right and it was a
threat of censorship, a device to check the Editor
of The News, then this present move of the Board
is but another and further step toward the reali-
zation of the threat. 1 _

We hope that this action of. the Board. is not
another threat, and that it is simply a coincidence.
We did not think then that it would be_wise to
accept either of the two alternatives which were
suggested, and we do not think so now. Such _a
gesture as this might succeed in curbing the Edi-
tor but in so doing the Board would do irrepar-
able damage to the University.

We hold generally no brief for the qualityof
college journalism. We think that it ought to.be_
better than it is, and what we have done has been
done in pursuance of this belief. We realize that
most of the material many college newspapers
print is not “news” so much as it is “publicity”
notices of dinners, meetings, dances, etc. And
thus-college journalism cannot help but appear
sometimes uninteresting. But need college jour-
nalism be immature? It will not be so, as long
as the responsible heads of student publications
attempt and are allowed to exercise honest in-
telligcnce. p _ .

An independent, mature student newspaper is
an asset and not a liability to a university. This
University needs such a newspaper.

Utopia

ODAY NINE nominating committees an-

nounce their candidates for Officers Of the
women’s organizations next year. It is hard for
those unacquainted with the system used by
these committees to‘ realize that these selections
are based purely on the merits of the women

hard -for those who are acquainted with the man-

thoroughness and impartiality with which every
name is discussed without having first been
checked as “desirable” or “undesirable” by a spe-
cial interest group testify that it is done. We have
seen the committees in action and have also kept
our ears open around and about the campus for

By Nick Spanos
Stanley Has Stuﬁ‘ - ’

Don Redman and his band head the stage show at
the Stanley this week and if you haven’t seen it ‘you’ve
got something to live for. In a small way of course, but
still it’s something. 1"

This Redman has a band tha‘t’s second to none. His
men not only can pour rhythm out of their horns but
they can sing-——and how they can sing. Don has a new
jerky, twisting style that even Fred Waring" can only
imitate. 1.

But the band isn't half of it. It’s just the background
for the classiest list of acts that have been here in a
couple of months of Sundays. The three Berry Brothers,
direct from Harlem, ‘steam up the stage} with a dance
act full of ‘tapping feet and wliirling canes and lots of
teeth; a tall, thin girl with a throaty, low-down voice
croons Cole Porter as he should be crooiied; aiiotlier
woman with a few more curves throws her hips all over
the stage and heat waves all over ‘the house; and to top
everytliiiig oﬁ‘ Buck and Bubbles pull off some comedy
singing and dancingand talking‘ that ought to leave you
in the aisles. _

The picture, “Her Ilusbaiid Lies,” altliougli by no
means a milestone in movie production,” is a surprisingly
well done version of an old story. I't’s all about the ad-
ventures of a big time gambler (Ricliardo Cortez) who
wants hiskid brother to be an honest man. ‘ «
. When you see it you’ll get a chance to sit in on some
pretty steep games of stud aiidto hear Akiin Tamiroﬁ’
make every line he speaks a punch line. Go! ,

Harlow Loves Taylor, Tslc . . .

Harlow loves Taylor in “Personal Property” at the
Penn. This picture is one that might, with tolerance and
charity, be called a “sprightly and scintillatiiig comedy.”
It would have been pretty good if the producers had left
it without -stars, for the -s'uppoi‘tiiig7. cast, headed by
Reginald Owens, is excellent, but the leads . . . wliew. . .

Harlow and Taylor prove that there are more ways of
killing a good line than Just. cutting it from the script.
These two alleged purveyors of light comedy do every-
thing but yodel with some of ‘the best dialog'tliat’s i'un

_,tlirough the Penn in a number of weeks.

'I‘aylo1',‘supposed to be the black sheep of an English
manufacturing family that is in need of capital, smirks

-Wltll zest for the full two hours. Unfoiftunately, this is

not funny. And Jean “Harlow, playing the part of a
smart American girl, should have stuck to her narrow
range of character parts. -

“Personal Property” makes its first mistake when. it
shows Harlow at- the opera. Maybe I’m wrong, but Miss
Harlow has never been particularly good at looking like
a music lover. The picture continues to make mistakes
every time it lets Harlow lead wi'th her chin instead of
her hips. Another major flaw in the ﬁlm is that it gives
Taylor nothing to do with his hands. There is no necking,
ovcii of the plainest variety, until the ﬁnal fadeout and
I imagine Robert must have been pretty restless what
with meniories of Garbo and Camille.

Good Views On “Love Is News”

The Fulton seems to be having a monopoly on the
year’s funny pictures. It scores again with “Love is
News.” This IS a picture about reporters and its only
slip is in continuing the traditional Hollywood newsman.
Repor_ters may be screwy but they don’t play checkers
on the floor with beers and whiskeys instead of little
wooden chips. They can't afford it.

Aside from that, “Love is Nexis” proves timely and
funny. It’s full. of many impossible situations, rangiiig
from country jails to airplanes. The _.,ac1..ing of Loi‘c'tta
Young; TY1‘Oll£.POWG1‘S, and Don Anieclie iiiay not be

_exc_eptio1ial but ,it’s good. Tyrone Powers who, according

to the papers is ﬁghting R. Taylor for the title of Holly-
wood’s No. 1 Pretty Boy, gets ‘my vote. GO!

“Good Earth” Great‘ -

The “Good Earth” is worthy of every adjective Holly-
wood is. used to throwing arouiid. It may well be the
finest picture of the year. Paul "Mimi and Louise Rainer.
turn in p‘ei'formances that ought to get them another
batch of medals. '

The grimness of famine; the terror of revolution; the
horror of beady hordes of locusts; the bitter struggle
of the Chinese peasant against a forbidding nature, all
these are brought home to the audience with a reality
that is vivid and startling.

Study  
In Comfoiet

By Milton Lehman

(Editor's Note: This is the fourth
in a series of articles dealing with
the mechanics and composition of

the Cathedral Library.)

   

 

THIRD MAJOR SERVICE division"

of the Cathedral library is the
reference department, under the di-
rection of Lorena Garlocli. reference

librarian. and Ethel Mallock and
Helen Donaldson, reference assist-
ants.

As the circulating department has
the speciﬁc purpose of lending vol-
umes of geiieral interest, as the re-
served book department is used to
facilitate required reading in various
courses. so does the reference depart-
ment have its particular function.

The fresliinan is assigned an inves-
tigative theme by his English instruc-
tor. Possibly “An Analysis of Snow
upon the,Himalayas,” and the fresh-
man is told to go to the reference
room for help.

“I want something upon snow on
the Himalayas,” the fresliinan de-
clares to Miss Garloch. “My English
prof said that I should come here.”

Whether it's snow upon the Him-
alayas or a critical interpietation of
the Venerable Bede, the reference
departmen't, according to Miss Gar»
loch, will do its best to provide in-
formation. Among the materials as-
sembled in systeniatic order for ref-
erence use niaterials not duplicated
by any other division of the library

magazine ﬁles of clippings.

As Miss Garl_c-cli points out, this
information ﬁle keeps in direct touch
with all curi'enl:. events through a
careful clipping of noteworthy maga-
zines of value. pamphlets obtained
‘through the H. W. Wilson service,
and news articles; clipped from such
newspapers as The New York Times,
Post-Gazette; and Christian Science
Monitor. This ﬁle, the reference li-
brarian said, is weeded out every
month, eliminating» clippings that are
of no furtlier reference value.-

Designed to simplify and facilitate
school: work, the reference depart-
ment maintains a number of services
for undergraduates, . graduate stu-

- dents, and niembers of the faculty.

The reference division will compile
bibliographies upon short notice, look
up answers to reference questions,
assemble .ina:terial for any subject de-
sired by University people making
use of the library. ‘ ‘

While none of the magazines kept
on reference’ may circulate, pamphlets
may be charged out for at one week
lending period. Through the mainte-
nance of an 11.11."-e1‘-lll)1'a1‘y loan system,
students and faculty members may
obtain volumes ‘that are not contained
in the University's collection from
libraries throughout the country. Ap-
plication for inter-library loan is made
at the reference desk.

At the present time the department
is compiling a new ﬁle which should
prove of unusual value to students at

A the University: a complete index of

The Pitt News, listing prominent
campus’ and student 4 activities as
listed in the student publication.
Thus far, ﬁve volumes of The Pitt
Weekll’. predecessor to the present
News, have been indexed.

“The possibilities of the reference
dep:i.rt.1nen't for use by students in
particular and the University in gen-
eral have not been widely publicized,”
Miss Garlocli declared. “We want the
students to know that we are pre-
pared to help them, and, further, we
want them to take advantage of our
services.

These moving pictures, which were
presented to the group by Mr. Pun-
ton and James P. Watson, super-
visor of the time-study department
of the same company, were made in
order to educate employees in the ad-
vantages of motion economy.

“The recent rise in the price of

LTABLE

Upset Of Upsets . . .

Just before the Easter vacation
there was an occurrence in ‘the Uni-
versity intramurals which rivalled the
Pitt-Duquesne upset in pure shock.
That it was overlooked till now should
not remove one iota of its news-
worthy character. -

First, a little bit of history: . . .

For the past three years the A
Kappa Sig basketball team has been
practically unbeatable. In fact, as
far as fraternity championships
have been concerned, the court
title has been almost conceded them ’
before each season began. Built‘
around the nucleus of three foot-
ball players who entered school in _
September, 1934, John Michelosen,
George Delich, and Don Hensley,
they mapped up all opposition,
rarely having what might be termed -

. a close call. A
And when they made it ‘three cups
in a row in fraternity competition, it
was a sure thing that they would con-
tinue right through the in'tramu1'al
playoffs, and emerge once more as the
University champion. . . . '

They Were Also ‘Good . . .

At the same time, the Chem En-
gineers had been piling up an en-'
viable record. With an organization
which could never be so closely
united as a. fraternity group, and
which could never be depended
upon to stick together from year
to year, they had placed second in
intramural basketball in 1935, and
had lost in the semi-finals last year.

But when these two teams met just
before vacation to de'termine the in-
tramural championship, nobody ex-
cept the man who picked Schmeling
over Louis gave the Engineers even
a ﬁghting chance. . . .

Yet the score at the end of the
game told an unbelievable tale. The
ChE's started fast. piled up a big
lead, which the Kappa Sigs tried
to cut a few minutes before the
end. But the engineers worked cool-
ly while the Kappa Sigs tried hard,
and the finish read: ChE 31, Kappa
Sig 29. And thus, to all those fans
who like to see the underdog come
through, we nominate Pitt’s third
representative to the Brotherhood
of Winning Underdogs, .-the Chem
Engineers, as having all the char-
acteristics by which they can be
ranked right beside the Rose Bowl

Everybody enjoys refreshing mildness

Talking Tennis . . .

With the University-wide tourna-:

mcnt opening one week from ‘today,
the one minor sport at the University

which most nezzrly attains the top--

notch status wliich Pit't.’s major sports
possess. Last year the tennis teamliad
one of its better seasons, and dropped
only one match. That was on the long
eastern ‘trip, when the boys" had to
meet Navy without the services of
“collarless” (not colorless) Captain
Joe Madden; V ' V ' ..
Since then, Madden and Roy
Heckler, his running mate, have
graduated; yet prospects for this
season are as bright as ever. At
number one for the third consecu-
tive year will be I__’_\_i~t,_t__,§b,11_r_gili’::- best
young tennis player,‘ Bob Madden.
Following in the steps of Baltimore _
Eddie Jacobs and Nate Ganger, he
has flirted with titles all over the
East while being practically un-
beatable in intercollegiate matches.
He hit the heights last winter when
he fought his way to the ﬁnals of
the National Junior Indoor Cham-
pionships before losing on what the
newspapers called a “questionable
decision.”

Lots of Juniors . . .

Back of Bob are a whole bevy of
juniors with a year of winning ex-
perience under their belts. Number
two man almost certainly will be
Ralph Bald, a player who is best at
handling low deep—c0u1't shots, and as
consistent a shot-maker as the Pan-
thers have seen in quite a while.

Other probable starters are easy-
going Bill McKenna, ping-pong star
Ivy Solow, and chop-stroke artist
Johnny Megan. All in all, with pos-
sible additions coming up from the
freshman team, a successful tennis

season should be expected.

Ever since we ﬁrst published the
list of quality point averages of ath-
letes, it’s been something of a head-
ache with us. For a whole week no-
body found anything wrong with it,
until last Wednesday; then we got a
note that someone had done some bad

taste and pleasing aroma.

These are the things that make

smoking a pleasure.
For all the good things that smok-

ing can give you we invite you

Lupinacci, Caruso Lose
Decisions In Finals

Witl.1 Rulpli l7o1‘a1.1cl winning
the 115-pound title, the Pantl1e1'
boxers tied West Virginia for
third place l1o.no1's in the Eastern
l‘11te1'Collcg:ial:e C-on.t'c.rence box-
iilg clm_mpionsl1ips held in Phil-
adelphia Friday and Satllrduy.

R-alpli Caruso, 135—pound, and
George Lupinacci, l1cavywe1'gl1t,
accounted for the rest of the l‘antncrs

11 points, both losing out in the finals.-

Carllso was upset by Bucknell’s Wil-
liam Amlro.:=l;1, while Lupinacci found
Asliby Dickerson, of West Virginia,
last yca1"s conference clmmpion, in a
1‘epcating‘- mood, and lost out after
l?ll1‘CC rounds of furious slugging.
Cuminiiigs 'l‘KOcd

The other three member:s of Coach
Jack Scl1ricker’s “ﬁgliting seven” con-
ﬁned their boxing to a “one night
stand.” Herb Cumming’s bout with
Comber of Temple was stopped in the
third round with Herb in distress.

.Joe Valentino, Bucknell’s football end,

proved his victory over Ray Bombe-
earlier in the season was no ﬂuke by
outslugging the local 165~pound in
an interesting match. The third Pan-
ther to be eliminated on opening night
was Emil Halley, who lost a 175—pound

battle to Bill Davidson of Temple.

The Pantl1c.r’s cliances of picking
up a few points in the:125-pound class
were blasted when Homer Livingston
arrived at the scene of battle with a

-Sl.(')l1‘lEl.Cl1 ailment that automatically

pushed him out of the tournament.

nlultripliczrtion S0111GWl1C1‘(3 along the
line, and in doing so, had greatly un-
(lerrated Red Tost, star milcr, by giv-
ing: him a 2.14 averagge instead of
his 2.7 which in reality made him the

.higl1cst ranking athlete. . . .

So . . . we printed the correction
under his picture,’ and attempted to
V pull some journalistic pyrotechnics
by associating his scholastic record
_ with his University mile record. We
captioned his picture “Marks: 4:25,
2.7.” And there we committed an-
other injustice to Red. His record,
we discover, is 4:21. And we hope
‘this settles the question at last. We
wash our hands of the entire mat-
ter.

Boxing Coach
Opens School
Schrickcr to Train Novice

R-ingmen for Coming,
Month In Stadium

Wanna learn how to ﬁght? If you

"do. Boxing Coach Jack Schricker will

give out some pointers in the manly
art of self—defense in his newly
organized boxing school which opens
today at the boxing headquarters in
the Stadium, _ ‘

The only requirement Schricker
has made is that no ‘candidate shall
have had any previous experience
with the gloves. Jack hopes his “brain
.i:l1ild” will accomplish two things.
“First, I think every boy should
know something about boxing,” said
the youthful mentor. “And second,
it will enable those boys who come
out to keep in tip-top shape.” There's
always a chance that one or two
promising newcomers might help the
varsity squad but Jack -didn’t say any-
thing about that. -

Practices will start today and will
continue for about a month. Jack-‘will
be at the training quarters from 2:30
until 5:30 o’clock daily to put the
candidates through light workouts

that will include road work, bag-
punching and some boxing.

From now on, the
favorite, and only
indoor sport will be
ping pong.

Intramural  
Ping Pong
