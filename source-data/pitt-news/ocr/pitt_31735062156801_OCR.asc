By Myron Kopelman

Chancellor Rufus H. Fitzgerald rushed into
the Pitt dressing room, pitched his arms around
Mike Milligan in a very unchancellor-like fashion,
and cried, “Bless your soul, Mike, bless your
soul.”

Pitt had just upset Ohio State, 12-0, and the
players were hugging and kissing each other in a
merry scene. ’

Across the corridor, a stream of red-jerseyed
men. trudged into their_ locker room, slam_ming
their headgears against the wall in disgust. Ollie
Cline, a bigiblonde halfback who had run, blocked,
and tackled ﬁercely for a lost cause, cried like a
baby.

Wes Fesler slouched in a corner, running his
ﬁngers through his hair and shaking his head. in
dismay. “Oh brother, those Pitt guys really
wanted to win,” he said. “No, we weren’t over
confident, just" outplayed.”

Across the hall, the grinning Milligan de-
clared, “I’m tickled, just tickled. Evcryoile played
great and I’m a satisﬁed man.”

That statement was a fact. Defensively, Walt
Cummins, 205 pound quarterback was probably
the outstanding player on the field. Willﬂtl the
Panthers held four times inside their own six in
the third period, it was the team of (}l1iz11n'ii1s and
Barkouskie ‘tllal stopped. the Bucks three tinles.

The Pitt oiieilsive attack had at last 1naterial-
ized. State tacklers had found little Bimbo Cec-
coni as hard to hold as a live fish. Time and again,
Bimbo sqnirmed and twisted out of their anxious
hands. And in the fourth quarter, he spcared Carl
I)ePasq_ua"s pass one-handed in tile end zone for
l’.it.t’s second touchdown.

The surprise of the afternoon owas the (ie.i'e11-
sive work of Frank (iapcllo, Pitts scrub end. Reg-
ular end Leo Skladany was sidelinled in the first
period with a leg injury, and it was feared that a
glaring weakness would he left at that position.

(“Iapello ailswemd this by r«)1nsistenlly bursting

Down on the Pill bon('.l.I. Hill Abraham was
handling the telcpho_ne which is connected to the
p___ress.box., from which point a scout points out
weaknesses. The Jeannette t'u|l.hack, who injured
his leg before the first game, has resigned .l1"in1self

to a season on the sidelines.

Farmer Coach

Nothing More

Wes Fesler returned to Colum-
bus with two souvenirs of his
jaunt to Pittsburgh.

One was the 12-0 loss adminis-
tered by the Panther football
squad. The other was a copy of
the 1946 Owl presented to him
last Friday night at the alumni re-
union.

Wes got the yearbook as he rose
to deliver a speech for the alum-
ni. Scotty Gardner, Owl circula-
tion manager, appeared garbed in
an Owl head and handed Wes his
book. -

Somewhat dumbfounded, Fes-
ler admitted ruefully, “I didn’t
pay for it yet.”

Then’ he added, “I paid $2 for
this book, but I hope I can get
away without paying the rest.”
He did.

The stunt was part of the Owl's
promotion campaign aimed , at
drumming up sales for the 1948
book.

Gardner, clad in his Owl’s head,
put in additional appearances at
the pep rally and the OSU game
to remind students that deadline
for purchases is drawing near.

 u r Te a m
sRed Hot  

By Dick Kovar
Pandemonium hit Oakland early yesterday as the delayed ac-
tion explosion of Saturday’s grid triumph let go with results that
rivalled V-J Day. Thousands of students overflowed the campus and‘
deadlocked traffic at Fifth and Bigelow, tying up town-bound trafﬁc I
while every Forbes street trolley swelled the crowd with victory-

 

starved Pittites.

University officials threw open Soldiers and Sailors Memorial‘
Hall two hours ahead-of the rally.

slated for 11 am. in an effort to
reduce the mob by a few thous-
and. All semblance of movement
in the blaring lines of cars ended
as three thousand celebrees mov-
ed en masse up Bigelow to the
Hall. Street cars pushing across
the jammed square were halted
repeatedly as trolleys were hauled
down, despite the efforts of a lone
Oakland gendarme to nab the of-
fenders. The driver of a huge
Duquessne Pilsener truck, taking
discretion as the better part of
valor, joined the cheering with
one hand while the other pressed
the air-horn. In the oppoosite di-
rection, a smaller truck, loaded
with open beer cases, was halted
while hopped-up Greeks debated
the wisdom of an open hijacking.
Both trucks ﬁnally go-tthrough as
the rush for the Memorial Hall
thinned the ranks that had stop-
pered traﬁic movement. During
the height of the initial celebra-
tion, however, about the only
thing going at the usually busy
intersection was the traffic light.

Inside Memorial Hall, cheer-
leaders organized the pent—up
emotions into cheers that rocked
the foundations. Players were
hauled up to the platform to
mumble phrases in between thun-
dering cheers» A roar of ap-
plause and laughter met Bob
Plotz’s remark “Where is this guy
Prince.”

The University Band, organized
hastily at the Cathedral, moved
onstage to put even more power
in the ral1y’s steamroller force.
Congress president George Lynn
captured the mike and nearly
brought down the roof with his
suggestion of a parade through
Tech and on downtown after the
rally. Shouts of “Where’s Mike?”
interrupted the impromptu pro-
gram constantly until the coach-
ing staff, minus Miligan, arrived
to put in a few words apiece.

“Doc” Carlson turned cheers to
laughter with his usual brand of
humor, thenretired as a tremen-
dous standing ovation greeted

One touch of ye old “blood and

.seen with the Community Fund
committee’s display on the ground
floor.

A large imitati-on pirate chest
has been borrowed from George
St. Clair, window display artist
for Max Azen and several Pitts-
burgh department stores. The
chest, serving as the center of the
display, is used as a reminder of
the coming campaign.

Ten thousand bookmarks, bear-
ing Community Fund publicity,
are being distributed this week
as additional advance publicity
for the drive, slated for Nov. 5
through Nov. 7.

The goal of $15,500 set for Pitt
is an increase over last. year’s.
Its basis was determined by a
realistic study of the school and
community needs. Tentative ar-
rangements are being made for a
free dance during the week of the
campaign.

All members of the Women’s

-The proposed plant will house a
9000-capacity sports arena, an in-
door track, squash and handball
courts, and a large swimming pool.
In addition to the arena, which
for some events will hold up to
15,000 spectators, a modern bas-
ketball court will also be in-
cluded.

These facilities will give Pitts-
burgh its largest closed-in arena,
meeting the demands of both a

creased student body as well.
Present athletic facilities include
the match-box Trees gym, its

once a track house’. The Pitt Sta-
dium basketball court holds only
2,600 spectators and has at times
been termed .unsafe for its pur-

the greatest advantage of the new
site will be the elimination of the

with members of all Greek social
groups represented on campus,”
Panhellenic spokesman Annabelle
Montgomery says.

The evening’s activity is di-

There wouldseem to be a consider-
able gap between the electrolysis of
salt to make sodium, and research in
the ﬁeld of organic chemistry. How-
ever, at Du Pont as much emphasis
is placed on organic research to de-
velop outlets for sodium as on its in-
organic uses:

For more than 15 years, intensive
work on industrial uses for sodium
has been carried on in‘ Du Pont lab-
oratories and plants by chemists,
physicists, chemical, mechanical and
electrical engineers.

In the organic ﬁeld, this research
has contributed a number of impor-

‘tant uses for sodium such as the re-

duction of fatty esters, particularly
of natural glycerides,_to alcohols.

o
Ci3H3ill-0R+4Na$::ﬂ?:,:>C.,,H3.CHzOH+4R0Na

 

Du Pont organic chemists have
found that sodium with selected sec-
ondary alcohols, such as methyl amyl
alcohol,  the presence of toluene or

xylene, eliminates shortcomings of
the classical method involving ethyl
alcohol and sodium. Practically quan-
titative yields of the higher molec-
ular weight alcohols are obtained. --

This new method is especially use-
ful in preparing unsaturated alcohols
not easily made by catalytic hydro-
genation. The process can be carried
out at atmospheric pressure and
compares favorably with catalytic
hydrogenation of satura__1_'.ed, higher
fatty esters becauseof the simplicity
of operation and equipment.

The discovery of the new reaction
conditions has led to the use of mi]-
lions’ of pounds of sodium annually
for manufacture of long-chain alco-
hols for wetting and emulsifying
agents and synthetic detergents.

Other important processes devel-
oped by Du Pont organic research
include the use of sodium for reduc-
tion of fatty esters to corresponding
long-chain acyloins, and reduction
of nitrile's to primary amines.

Monday from Harrisburg where he
represented Pitt in a meeting with
the State Department of Public

For Workshop
At University

Twenty-three nurses, represent-
ing national nursing groups, state
boards of health, and various uni-
versity nursing associations, are
students this week in Pitt’s Work-'
shop of Nursing.

Director of the workshop, Miss
Edna B. Groppe, explained that
the purpose behind the workshop
courses is “the improvement of
patient care by helping supervis-
ors and head nurses understand
their responsibilities for efficient
ward management and clinical
teaching.”

The nurses have come from po-
sitions of authority in many of
the hospitals and clinics of eight
eastern states. Each has brought
with her a speciﬁc problem or
case to present for study and dis-.
cussion.

The workshop, on the twenty-
ﬁfth ﬂoor of the Cathedral, has as
its theme for the two week course:
“The integration of the orthepedic
principles in nursing.”

Miss Jessie L. Stevenson, out-
standing leader in the study and
use of orthopedic principles and
author of many books and peri-
odicals on the subject, will attend
the meeting.

Miss Groppe said ,_that a work-
shop course will begin for super-
visors and head-nurses from psy-
chiatric hospitals. This theme was
also used the ﬁrst two weeks of
October, but the number of ap-
plications for admission so great-
ly exceeded expectations that not
all could be accepted at that time.

PiKA Wins, 26-6; i

Remains Unbeaten

Pi Kappa Alpha gained undisputed possession of ﬁrst place in
the American League by downing previously unbeaten Pi Lambda
Phi, 26 to 6. Displaying a hard running attack, the PiKA’s tallied
in every period last Thursday at Shadyside Field.

Resorting almost exclusively to power plays, the PiKA’s opened
the scoring with an eighty yard drive, Frank Dougherty going over

Indicating that they meant to
to make it a battle, the Pi Lambs
took the ensuing kick-off and,
with Mel Cohen and Bob Loevner
doing the ‘pitching, marched the
length of the ﬁeld to score. A ﬁne
catch by Jack Arch of a Mel Cohen
aerial was the six—point play.

Intend to Keep Title

This only served as an added

incentive for the PiKA’s, who pro-
ceeded to go through, around, and
over their tiring. opponents. The
contest proved to any skeptical ob-
servers that the PiKA’s intend

’ to retain their IM title.

With only a minute to go, Stan
Thomas, captain of the Civil B
squad in’ the intramural league,

' intercepted a “Lefty” Wynard pass

on his own ﬁve yard line and
walked the chalk all the way for

. the touchdown that defeated Civil

C’s, 12-7, last Wednesday at Trees
Field.

The BS scored early in the ﬁrst
quarter on a pass from Andy a-

‘fer to John Mallett to take the

lead, 6-0.

Culley Scores Once

On a series of pass plays in the
second quarter the C’s tied the
score when Wynard hit Johnny
Culley with a pass in the end zone
to tie the game. Wynard took a
pass from Larry Cunningham for
the extra point.

_The C’s appeared victory bound
until Thomas made his last minute
pass interception to win the game.

Meantime, Freshman Ramblers
won their ﬁrst Law School» game
by defeating the winless Pad Acds,
22-7 at Bubbles Field.

the Ramblers never relinquished
it until “Skip” Reed had passed
to Harry Kramer in the end zone
for the ﬁrst score. In an effort to
win their ﬁrst agme, the Pad Acds,
after a Martin—to-Giles pass, had

the opportunity with the score at
half-time, 7-6.

But a safety on the kickoff and.
a pass interception by Kramer put
the score out of reach of the Pad
Acds, A fourth quarter pass from
Reed to Stupar insured the Ramb-
ler’s ﬁrst win.

Bierman Squad
Strong After
Wartime lull

Around Minneapolis, the Min-
nesota fans are again starting to
root for Bernie Bierman. They
insist that Bierman is entitled to
his old place as the nation’s lead-
ing coach.vHe held the crown in
1940 and 1941 when Minnesota
teams were National Champs.

The Golden Gophers\ made a
slow recovery last year in their
return to football glory. In Bier-
man’s ﬁrst year after his discharge
from the Marine Corps, the Goph-
ers won ﬁve while dropping four.

No one conceded the Gophers
much of a chancebefore the sea-
son opened this year. They were
relegated to a minor role in the
Big Nine Orbit but Bierman has
fooled his deriders. Minnesota has
won three out of their ﬁrst ﬁve
games, losing only to the Illinois
and Michigan powerhouses.

No T for Bernie

Bierman doesn’t hold with the
new fangled “T” inspired ideas of
brush blocks and light liens. His
forward wall is massive, averag-
ing more than 205-pounds. They
halted the Illini charges and then
outrushed them. A weak pass de-
fense defeated them.

Minnesota’s strength lies in its
front line. This strength is also
the ‘weakness. Though the line
can’t ‘be moved, it won’t move
either. It was this absence of.
charging that enabled the Illinois
passers to take their time and
aim.

Minnesota’s jauggernaut de-
pends upon ground traction to roll
but the Gophers can call upon a
"workable passing attack when
the land offensive bogs down.
However, the- Minneapolis Maul-
ers prefer sweeps through the
line for their yardage.

Last .Meeting Unpleasant

Despite the large front wall, the
backs are small and ‘speedy and
not meant for the punishing power
plays upon which their attack de-
pends. This‘« factor has added a
growing casualty list to Bierman’s
troubles. ' '

Pitt last met Minnesota in Sep-
tember 1942. Tony DeMatteo took
the opening kickoff and returned
it for a touchodwn but Minnesota
power won out. The ﬁnal score
was 50-7.

Students who did not pick up
identiﬁcation cards last week
should ask for them at the Stu-
dent Desk on the Ground Floor_.

Panthers Thrash 

Ohio State, 12-O

By John

Golightly

_ A. team they said wasn’t good enough to compete in the
Big N 1ne ﬁnally broke the W'estern Conference hoodoo and hand-

ily thrashed Ohio State, 12-0.

Under‘ ﬁre from several quarters after losing four straight

this year, the young Panthers

shutout the Buckeyes all the

way and raced against the clock to tally their initial six-

pointer.

With one minute and forty seconds remaining in the second
period, Pitt drove 29 yards in six plays to score just two sec-

onds before the halftime gun.
After Perini’s kick angled

out of bounds on the OSU 29,

Rickards and DePasqua passed
the Panthers to a ﬁrst down on the
18. Then, Jack Smodic completed
a toss to DePasqua for a ﬁrst down
on the OSU ﬁve.

DiMatteo Scores TD

Tony DiMatteo bulled over right
tackle on the second attempt for
the TD. It was
the ﬁrst time
this season the
Panthers ' have
been ahead at
the halftime.

And although
the Buckeyes
m a d e s o m e
t h r e a t ening
gestures early
in the third pe-
riod, it was all
Pitt the rest of
the way. The ~ » A
Buckeyes marched 59 yards to the
Pitt six where they had four
cracks at the Panther line and
failed to score.

It was a third period goal line
stand reminscent of some put on
by the Panther elevens in the thir-
ties. i

  

    

Line Smears Verdova.

After yieding three yards on two
bucks by Cline and one effort by
Verdova, Pitt’s line—led by Cum-
mins and Barkouskie --—- Jcoared
through to smear Verdova on the
Pitt four and take possession on
downs. ..

Pitt was then content to wait
until six minutes were gone in the
ﬁnal period before pushing 30
yards for the second tally.

Some nifty running by Jimmy
Joe Robinson coupled with two
dandy pass catches by Bimbo Cec-
coni led to the score.

With the fourth and goal on the
OSU ﬁve, DePasqua took a reverse
from Rader, ran to his left, then
pitched to Cecconi in the end zone
for the clincher score.

‘The 1948 Pitt riﬂe team, ac-

cording to Master Sergeant James

T. Doherty, sergeant major of the‘

ROTC, will “ﬁre against the best
competition we can ﬁnd.”
Sergeant Doherty revealed this
week that Pitt has issued chal-
lenges to every college in the
United States which boasts an
ROTC or varsity riﬂe team-129
schools from Maine to Texas.

District rivals include Duquesne

University, Penn State, and Car-’

negie Tech. A few -of the better
known schools from, outside this
area include Michigan, Ohio State,
Harvard, Cornell, Princeton, Mich-
igan State, Indiana, Fordham, and
Oklahoma A & M.  -

In addition, several purely mili-
tary schools, including Virginia

Y

Military Institute ‘and Citadel,

were invited to ‘compete against
the Pitt riflemen.

 Still
s Bad News

Scherb

Eight years ago, Halfback Dick Cassiano meant bad news to
Pitt’s Saturday rivals by his brilliant ball carrying. Today, Coach
Dipﬁk Cassiano still means bad news but this time to Pitt with the
scouting reports of next Saturday’s foe.

. Cassiano hasn’t had a chance to see a Blue and Gold game this
 yearalthough he spends his working days as backﬁeld coach. Comes

1‘ the weekend, Dick packs his bag and heads for Ann Arbor or Min-
neapolis or wherever Pitt's next challenger is playing.

Dick cl-aims that a football scout’s life is hard. His job entails
tiring travel and hard work during a game. There isn’t much chance
to sit back and enjoy a. game because every. play entails a series of

A
V

operations to be noted.

Scouting Hard Work

When asked if the job ever be-
came routine, Pitt’s OSS man re-
plied, “Each team is a separate
team and must be dealt with in-
dividually.” He went on, “there
isn’t anything" thrilling about
scouting. It’s just hard work.”

Scouting has come a long way
‘since partisan spies sat on hilltops
armed with ﬁeld glasses. Scouts
ran the risk ‘of having themselves
lynched by eager rooters if discov-

the press‘ box.
Dick works alone and tries to
concentrate on a particular phase

scout a team for three weeks. The
ﬁrstVwe‘ek I watch their offensive
formations and defense. The sec-
ond and third weeks are assigned ‘
to watching plays and personnel.”

- Tipping Hard to Catch

Football observers are supposed
to be quick in catching actions
that tip off plays and enable weak-K
er teams to upset their opponents.
Cassiano dismissed this notion.
‘Tipping is hard to catch unless
you are familiar with the team

own team by getting them over-
anxious about it,” he said.

',The scout’s real work comes
after hehasireturned home. Then
he and the coaching staff have

of stopping the enemy’s strength
and capitalize on his weaknesses.
Dick concluded, “No matter how

them when they are stronger than
weare. The r-eal job lies with the
boys on the ﬁeld.” .

Winning their fourth straight
game, the Eagles defeated a hard-
ﬁghting Vets team, 20-18, last
Thursday at Shadyside ﬁeld.

The Eagles came from behind
in the fourth quarter when Pete
J aczesko intercepted .a Vets pass
and sprinted 40 yards down the
sideline for the winning touch-
down.

With less than a minute left, the
Vets passed for a ﬁrst down on

The Vets pounded home the

first score of the game late in ‘the

‘ Fighting \back in the second
quarter, the Eagles pushed across
two touchdowns. J aczesko pitched
a 15 yard pass to Bob Mast for
the first score. Later, J aczesko
again passed for a touchdown,
this time a 30 yard heave to Bill

College President Scores Educational Set-Upl
As Archaic Remains of Medieval System

(l.P.)—-0 - . ..

OAKLAND, CALIF.
Stressing the contribution which
Mills College can make in leading
the way to a new and broader
conception of the higher educa-
tion of women, President: Lynn T.
White. Jr., in an address at the
college assembly, said that our ed-
ucational sy'st.em is a relic of the
medieval system, which was de-
signed to ﬁll the needs of male
celibate clerics.

Dr. White pointed out that the
emphasis has been changed from
stressing the individual and the
Church to stressing the individual
and the state. He added that the
institution of the family is not giv-
en enough prest.ige.

He labeled as false two oppos-
ing‘ assumptions of most men (and
also women's colleges), in regard
to women and education. L

The first is that women are in-
ferior in intelligence to men. The
Second is that women are equal in
every way emotionally as well as
intellectually. Until it is realized
that women can be different from
men. and yet not "inferior, educa-
tional systems cannot fulfill their
needs.

Colleges must prepare women
for marriage, as well as for careers,
Dr. White said. He added that a
