Fraternity men must now main-
tain.at least a 2.25 overall QPA

if theywant to help keep their

organizations on campus it was
decided by Interfraternity Coun-
cil Wednesday night.

If'any fraternity fails to main-
tain a 2.25 QPA for ._the entire
house, for twoisuccessive trimes-

5~,_ters, it will‘ be placed on social

 According to Mark Bebko, IF
president, “The fraternities decid-
ed that it was about time that we
did something. With this plan,
within the next two years our av-
erage should be as high as the all
men’s average”, _

Lecture Series Planned

IF is also planning to set up a
lecture series similar to the Mid-
day Series. Men representing
various national fraternities will
sponsor lecture—discussion ses-
sions at which they will discuss

topics of interest to the fraterni-

ties ‘such as rushing and pledg-

ing. .

“Campus packs,” consisting of
a razor, razor blades, aspirin‘
tablets, shaving cream and after
shave lotion, worth _ $4.00‘ have

C been made available to IF by

$Drama of Southern Politician up

iAllen has utilized many

Brechtian techniques in stag-. " "

used by Bertholdt Brecht {in

Moscow after the rcvolutioni.‘_~

Allen feels these techniques re-
sult in _“a more complex reac-
'tion ‘ -to the "characters and
questions raised in the play-
through the use -of irony.”

The concepts involved are “po-
litical morality,

whether ends ‘

justify the means,” and the charg ’

acter, “an attractive nero as well
as repulsive,’_’ according to Allen.-

single room. The C tower will be
for graduate students and will
consist of only single rooms.

Rates for Rooms
The rates of a double and single
room will be $200 and $225 re-

esting to note that the $200 rate
for the new dormitories is identi-

room in Schenley Hall,” Whalen
stated.

’ At present, all men residents
have a $35 damage deposit on
their rooms. When’ students
want to validate their room
contracts for the fall term, and
from now on, they must pay a
$75 deposit. This deposit will be
subtracted from the payment
for the rooms in the ‘fall. Stu-
dents coming in the fall who
have already ‘paid the $35 de-
posit for this year, will have to
pay‘$40 in April.

Those students not returning in
the fall can write to Whalen at
the end of the term and their de-

90 days. .

Whalen stressed that all under-
graduate men living in the resi-
dence halls must buy a meal
ticket. Whalen _also said,
“Whereas this year we had one
counselor for every 68 residents,
we hope to have one counselor for
‘every 38 next year.” '

The new dormitories will

operate on the “house system”
-which consists of division of the
~ dorms into three-ﬂoor sections.
The. middle floor will be a
lounge and the upper and lower
ﬂoors will house 40 men each.
Next to the lounge will be a
recreation room where the men
can “let off steam.”

Large recreation rooms '-will.be
in the basements of the towers,
and a gym room and sundecks
will be located on the top ﬂoors.
Eac-h tower will have a lounge for
all resident students. On the
ground level will be the dining
rooms.

Whalen declared, “We are one
of the ﬁrst in the nation with this
kind of housing.” In reference to
the new residence halls being
built in the form of towers he
said, “They were built that way
so that more people can be housed
in less space.”

He also stated that the cost is
lower when building up instead
of out, and that air conditioning
is more feasible with this type
of building.

“We want to make the new resi-
dence halls an integral part of the
university life. The house arrange-
ment gives a different atmosphere,
both socially and academically,”

 Mellon Geochemist  
to Faculty

THEORIZING, Dr. A. J. Cohen illustrates that the Gulf of St. Law-
rence could be the crater made by the impact of an asteroid or a
comet. An impact of this magnitude would have strewn debris over
a large portion of North America, he has stated.

Dr. Alvin J. Cohen, senior Mellon Institute scientist in
geochemistry, has been appointed to the faculty of the new
Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences. _

His duties at the University will-includeteaching a grad-
uate course in the chemistry and physics of the moon, direct-i
ing graduate studies, and conducting his own research. His

course may be open _to selectedé

undergraduates. . ’
Important Discoveries
Recently, Dr. Cohen vmade im-

portant discoveries about the pos-_

sible terrestrial origin‘ of tektites,
the oldest known glassin exist-
ence, ranging from 600,000 to 35,-
000,000.years old. The source "of,

-these fragments, found fin ﬁve

areas of the earth’s surface, is as
yet undetermined and is of great
"interest in space research.

At the University, he will
continue’ his work on tektites,
fossil meterorite ‘craters, the
surface of the moon, and the
chemistry and physics of ma-
terials related to space uses.

As‘head of the Pittsburgh Plate

Glass Co. research project for the,"

past ﬁve years, Dr. Cohen has de-
veloped a colorless glass which
turns amethyst color in the pres-
ence of. sunlight. Possible use of
the glass include automatic sun-
glasses for buildings and “built—
in” sunglasses for prescription

Degrees
Dr. Cohen received his bach-
elor’s degree at the University of

Florida and his doctorate in in-

organic chemistry- at the Univer-

Sity of Illinois.

Dr. Cohen has traveled ex-
tensively to ‘ investigate ' fossil-

. impact craters. In 1959 he visit-
ed Czechoslovakia in an effort
to discover tektites, and» this
summer he will beva member of
a Canadian expedition to ex-
plore uninvestigated fossil crat- '
ers, ranging in size from ten to
190 miles in diameter.

-The new. department hopes to
attract “outstanding students who
are looking for a career in space
and in planetary or geo-physical
research pertaining to the earth’s
interior,” said Dr. Cohen.

He feels that “the new depart-
ment of Earth and Planetary Sci-
ences will bring to the students of
-the University the opportunity of
in’ ﬁelds" which have
never been available in this part
of the United States, and will open
to them new university and in-
dustrial positions upon gradua-
tion.”

SU Board
Plans Europe
Summer Tour
The Student Union Board
planning ‘a European tour for this
summer that is to include visits
to European landmarks,‘plenty of
free time, discussions with uni-
versity students in other coun-
tries and East and West Berlin,

and interviews with members‘ of
the British Parliament.-

_The tour is arranged in con-.

junction with the University’s an-
nual’ “Pitt Abroad” ﬂight spon-
sored by the Olﬁce of Cultural and
Educational Exchange.

This is the third year which
the “Pitt Abroad” plane has
made thetrip and the first year,
in‘ what the SUB hopes will be
an annual tradition, fora gen-
eral tour of .eight European

countries aimed at the interests
of the University community.

Larry.He1ler, co-director of the
Student Union and a European
traveler himself, has agreed to be
tour director.

A maximum of 25 people may
be accommodated for the “tour.
The complete fare is $910. This
includes $385 group rate air fare
and $525 land expenses, complete.

SUB hopes that members of
the ‘University administration
staff and faculty will seriously
think about taking this tour, as
well as members of the student
body.

activity with the student bodyiit
represents involves student parti-
cipation. “It is very important to
get the student body interested in
SG, and the only way to do this
is get them "working for SG.”
Bijur points out that the list
of incoming freshmen indicat-
ing interest in SG committees
and the list of students from the
Activities Fair, last trimester
“were never fully exploited.
“When students are involved
and know more about the opera-
tion, they can show the admini-
stration an educated support of
certain projects,” he says.
Pamphlets
Bijur suggests that pamphlets
listing the purposes and projects
of Student Government, the sen-
ators and their phone numbers,

be sent to students in. the fall to-

cement communications.

In a further intensiﬁcation of
communication linkage, Bijur
calls for the seven vice-presi-
dents sitting on the senate to
take “a more active role as

- channels for student voice” as

“the biggest potential contact
for reaching every student.” '

Bijur emphasizes starting SG
projects early “to leave more
time for planning and review and
evaluation of past experience in
procedure.

‘Fall Project Chairmen

“By ‘mid-summer the fall pro-
ject chairmen and their commit-
tees will be set up so that they
can start working. Thus Book
Exchange, the library committee,
the pamphlet, freshman outing,
Parents,’ Weekend, and Homecom-
ing» will have the _time to develop
and evaluate rather than rush
hea’d—long into plans.”

Bijur plans for‘ senate chair-
men and a “draw on the student
body at large” for the commit-
tees. .

In a last link of communication
and efficiency, Bijur advocates
that “SG must act to aid the fra-
ternity system for this co-opera-

tion between IFC and SG is very

important for the continuance and
improvement of the system. This
increased understanding and co-
ordination of efforts would result
in a better Homecoming and in
better enforcement of the alcohol
plan.” '

Lack of Communication
'Landy also claims “the lack of

communication as the most serious’

problem in Student Government."
His ﬁrst plan includes the SG
pamphlet, an idea discussed by
Landy and Bijur previously.

“But in o r e importantly,”

, Landy adds, “I would want ‘to

write a series of articles in

E the projects or voice particular

protests."

Landy includes in tcommunica- '

tion the involvement of. all the
undergraduate schools in projects

rather than concentrating on the

schoolvof Liberal Arts. “For in-
stance,” he cites, “in the Book
Exchange there was a tendency to
collect and sell Liberal Arts books
when the engineers » need the
mark-off on their more expensive
books. This would just require
notes to the Engineering and
Mines Cabinet and in the engin-
eering bulletin.
Segregation

Landy’s third plank concerns
the evidence of segregation prac-
tices in some Oakland housing
and business. “We can do some-
thing here if we get actively in-
volved,” Landy feels.

In-his last statement, Landy
emphasized the expansion of the

present service projectsvsuch as ‘

the Book Exchange, student di-
~rectory, human relations com-
mittee and winter weekend.
Landy is running under the
Able Party ticket “because with a
greatnumber of senators running

it is diﬁicult .for the. students to

"ﬁnd those most capable. This

way the students will know whom .

to vote for. I wouldn't permit any

“politicking later.” .Bijur is run-

ning independently.
Bijur's Activities
Bijur, president pro tem of the

senate, sat_ on the senate last year
as president of. Men’s Dorm Coun-

cil. This is his second year as‘

founding’ president. He also serves‘ -
as business manager of the Men’:
Glee Club and the Huntsmen as

well as chairman of Student Gov,-A} I

What has happened to the fairy godmother? I
, wonder not for myself primarily, but the more I
look around, the less I see of these patrons of
people. Perhaps it is a condemnation of our society

that people are increasingly sur'-
prised and even shocked when
I mention fairy godmothers. Are
such people unbelievers? Dis-_
believers? Or are fairy god-
mothers becoming extinct?
When I speak of fairy god-

mothers, I am not only speaking
of the ones who turn pumpkins
into carriages, and waifs into
princesses. Such goings-on are
ﬁne, but kingdoms are becoming
scarce, and carriages are becom-

ing scarce, and carriages are becoming severely
outdated. Kindly assistance, though, is no more
outdated now than it was during the height of the
Cinderellan popularity of fairy godmothers. Peo-
ple are still in need of help from those who have
know-how, know-who, magic wands, and magic,
words. Therefore, it‘seems ridiculous to think, as
some people obviously do, that fairy godmothers

are outdated or unnecessary.

Vulnerable Gaps Defected

And yet, they are rare, particularly in the so-
_called “adult worlcl.” For instance, anyone taking
a good look at student life could easily detect‘ many
in university patronage of

vulnerable gaps
proteges.

Perhaps the University feels that it isn’t en'-
dowed with any magical powers.
that it is in the wrong business — after all, ‘bring-
ing out the best in people always requires some
type of extraordinary talent). Or, more likely, the
University feels that it is doing its best, and that
this is sufficient. But best or not, it isn’t sutﬁcient.
I see the need for far more patronage. and assist-
ance infacilitating the transformation of a some-
’times scarcely bearable‘existe'nce into a period of
mental stimulation‘ and maturation.
It has been suggested recently by various mem-
bers of the University staff that intellectual apathy
is widespread -among the students. And yet, other

 

' whether this is apathy. that makes a student show
gross indifference to his studies, or if it is .a lack
of stimulation from his work. Undoubtedly, it is‘—,_< 7-:
a combination of the two. But it is in the area of
stimulation that the University appears to be in ,
dire needvof some fairy godmothersi V
Oh‘! for some professors, who don“: appear to be
machines in which one puts ninety-nine dollars
plus fees, and out pops a series of well—aged reci-
tations of conjunction—joined facts!
some professors who truly (rather than _saying
stop me if you have a question) encourage class-
room discussion! ‘ i _ u
I am quite sure that there are already a few
professors who are offering such courses in mental W
awakening, but there could never be enough of 
them. Students need to be guided, encouraged, and '
inspired by someone, and it is the professor who , H
is in the best position to provide- that. V ' ii
Patronage Lacking . ~
And yet, the faculty itself is handicapped by a 4
lack of patronage by the administration. Before the 3.
professors can give proper attention to the students,
they have to be assured that they will have enough
money to buy food, enough time to sleep a“"few 
hours after their extracurricular work, and enouglr ’ ,
leeway‘ in course material to be able to ,interject4 
"some original ideas. The faculty must know that
the administration is interested in them as human ‘
beings rather than teaching machines. Only then
can the professors adequately ‘serve the students. :1
_- Somewhere, though, the spirit of ‘patronage has
been lost, and people-”can’t afford to play. fairy
godmother at their own expense. Somewhere along
the line, life has evolved into an each—man—for-
himself process, and the strongest Vman takes-all.
But the result of this process can never be ‘pro-
gressive, and the University will soon

30 me/I lore/°uc.[ice

By ED PLOCH
Ed Ploch, a ‘junior majoring in Political Sci-
ence, wrote this letter is Freda Kellams as a re-
sponse to her article, “Pitt Provincialism,” which
appeared as a “Mosaic” in the Wednesday, Feb.
20 Pitt News.
Dear Miss Kellams, _
In your Mosaic, “Pitt Provincialism,” you ask-

ed the question “why”? The reason “why” is simp-

ly that this _is the planet Earth, twentieth century
A.D., not the idyllic World we e11’-yearn for.

Prejudiceknows no boundaries. It ﬁnds a haven
in Africa and -Asia, not just in.America or the
“province” of Pittsburgh or among the “members
of the University family,” whateverthat is.

You asked, Why do they stare, make‘ crude re-
marks, and display nervous aversions? The an-
swer: “They” just don’t know any_better.lIt’s as
simple a‘s,,that. Come down out of the intellectual
clouds, Miss Kellams. '

If you invited Abraham Lincoln himself to speak
at freshman women’s orientation, his words would
probably have as little effectgin the long’ runlas
would those of Dean Rush, Dean Martin, or -Dr.
Heath. Sound waves traveling through empty minds
leave no trace.

The University does not automatically transform
boy and girls into forthright, broad-minded men
and women. Many unfortunately graduate as the
same narrow-minded,_vain boys and girls who en-
tered four ‘years earlier.

The University can only present the most basic
human values to the individual; it cannot make him
believe or accept them. This is a’ rather unspectacu-
lar revelation, but it is precisely the point that you

.scem to overlook. A

The ability of organizations such as faculties
and administrations to eradicate racial prejudice is

negligible. Pretty speeches and policy statements’

are all very well and good, but after all are just
words. ' . V

The solution to any kind of big ry rests in in-
dividual contact, contact, contac_t._ To my mind,
nothing melts prejudice more than to meet and
talk with a member of some other “race,” religion,
or what have you. t

We “White trash”, “grays”, and the like will join
in the battles in ever—increasing numbers, but the
conduct and initiative of the war remains with the
Negro.

Yes, it’s their war, not ours, at least in practice.
To obtain the maximum contact with the enemy,
the American Negro must learn to stop acting like
the American Negro. ' .

He must stop crying and feeling sorry for him-
self, and stop cringing before the boss—man. Above
all, he must stop the over-compensatory behavior
known in unofﬁcial circles as “diddily-bopism’.”

The ﬁnger-snapping, over-dressed, pseudo-blase, '

shadewearing, ' way out, endsville Negro attracts
prejudice as honey does bees.

Every time I meet one of these strange creatures
I despair at what the white man has created, and
seriously question my own feelings of racial neu-

ltrality, which I suppose is a reflection on myself.

The point is,Athe Negro ‘must abandon his own
private world, or at least legitimize it in the eyes
of the "white sea.

You say that the “downright ﬂagrancy at Pitt is
deplorable.” I have not experienced a single inci-
dent of ‘anti-Negro’ behavior _in two years here;
which,.I guess, is equivalent to saying I have not
experienced a single incident "of ‘anti-Negro be-
havior in two years.

sHowever, I have been discriminated against

twice this week by Negroes at Pitt‘ and on a street-

corner. On Monday, "an African student gave me a
dirty look with the energy of an x‘-rayfor no ap-
parent reason other xthanthe color of I my skin.

His hatred made me cringe just as your friend
must in similar ‘situations. Going home from school
today, two Negroes on a street—corner » displayed
rather unoriginal versions of prejudice. One delib-
erately spat as I walked by, the other made the
characteristic’ teeth-sucking noise, which he had
developed to a "rather professional degree.

I’m familiar with thissortof thing, because it

V happens to me quite often. This is a most frustrat-

ing aspect of interracial contact e guilt by as-
sociation, whether on the part of blacks or whites.
The enemy was white; I was white; therefore I was
the enemy.

They should give us whites or" whatever a
break. We are not all Ku Klux Klan members or
apologists. The trouble is that this also cannot be
determined by the color of one’s skin".

May I respectfully close with some advice: (1)
Don’t go looking for intellectualtruths; there are
none. (2) Don’t expect words from exalted oﬂicials
to work miracles. (3) Don’t ﬁght hatred with hat-
red. (4) Have your friends keep embarrassing us
whites, “rational” or otherwise. ,

Perhaps two or three hundred years from now
the haters of bigotry will outnumber the bigoted
haters. A
Sincerely yours,

Ed Ploch

It

Saturday and led the Panther
wrestlers to a come-from-behind,
16-14, victory over Penn State.‘
The Panthers were losing 14-13
when Ware met Dick Walker in
the ﬁnale. The script called for
Ware to get pinned. It had hap-
pened here a year ago against the
same Walker. It had happened

 

twice against Lehigh when a win
would have meant team victory.

Walker scored a take-down in
the first period, but Wareflater
escaped, scored a reversal and
compiled riding time in the ﬁnal
period against the brother of for-
mer ‘Panther football end Fritz
Walker to gain‘ a'5-2 victory,

Ware’s win erased the gloom of
Jim Harrison’s first loss of the
year and Mike Johns0n’s 2-2 draw
with Bob Haney._

  

Coach Rex Peery was not dis-
appointed with J ohnson’s showing.
“Mike had to do all the work,” he
said. “It seemed like Haney was
happy with the draw. Mike was
the aggressor the whole way.”

Haney had a second period re-
versal compared to two escapes
for Johnson. The draw gave the
Panthers a 5-2 lead after Tom
Heniﬁ’s 5-2 win over ’Eastern
third-place ﬁnisher Denny Slat-
tery. ’

. Athletic Director Frank Carver, the patron saint of cor-

heartless gold digger, and a plain bum. I
v He has been the "focal point of rebellion here ever since_

he declined the bid to the -National Invitational Tournament
and okayed the offer from the bigger NCAA basketball

tournament.
Struggling to overthrow

an eminent dictatorship, stu-

dents had posted -signs of disfavor throughout the Student

Union.

’ “Carver Says NCAA — Students, "Players and All

Players Unanimous

The students ﬁgured the team’s chances were better in

the NIT and they wanted to watch them in action. The
basketball teamagreed. “We hadan informal meeting,” re-
ported co—captain Brian Generalovich, “and we- voted unani-
mously to go to the NIT. ‘ ’ V _ V _
“I told Mr. Carver about our feelings._ We’re' a young
team (four juniors ‘and a senior) and we don’t think we’re
ready for the NCAA this year. We understand, however, and
we’re not bitter. ' , ’ ,
“We can beat NYU, too,” General asserted. “They
don’t play much defense. If we can just get something
started we’ll be all right.” -

decision. Timmons was even worried that theteam might not

Lion Gymnasts
Rout Panthers
At State, 62-34

The Panther gymnasts
closed their regular season at"
Penn State Saturday by suf-

the year, a 62-34 shellacking at
the hands of_ the ‘powerful Lions.
Penn ‘State scored ﬁrsts "in
all six events, including a rare
triple by Tom Seward, who
won the free exercise, parallel
bars, and horizontal bar while
accounting for 18 team points.
Other Lion -winners were F. P.
Sforza in the long horse, Al
Porter in the side horse and
John Martin in the still rings.
The Panthers managed to" score
only three seconds. Roland James
finished second in the side horse‘,
Jack Lehner in the long horse,
and Ed Stim in the parallel bars.
The Panthers were never real-
ly‘in the meet as the Lions swept

‘After the Panthers had’ played soipoorly at the Phila-
delphia Palestra last week in losing to a weak Temple ball
club, George Kiseda of the Philadelphia Daily News, said,
“If I were Carver I’d telegram New York immediately and
beg to get in the NIT. I’ve seen NYU play and, believe me,
you won’t want? any parts of them.”

According to Carver, there was-no decision involved. '
‘‘We’re a member" of the,NCAA andlwe go to their tour-
nament,” he said. “It’s just a matterof policy with us.”

He dismissed the accusation that the athletic department I

feared loss} of revenue from the NCAA television package
during football season if they snubbed the ultimate power.

“The TV sponsors decide which teams they want to see
on television anyhow,” said Carver. .»

“I realize it’s an unpopular decision,” Carver said. How
would he have felt if Pitt had lost out on both tournaments
because of his hesitancy to accept the NIT bid? “I guessl
wouldn’t be too popular around here. Would I?”

It’s still doubtful that he would be elected BMOC by stu-
dents in -a popular vote. But he is.

pendent ‘B’ basketball Division of
the Intramural League by defeat-
ing previously unbeaten Apart-

YMHA Tourney  
Offers Challenge
To IM Champions

Some of the better intramural
basketball teams have an oppor-
tunity to test their ability against
the strongest teams in the West-
ern Pennsylvania area in the Mac-
cabiad Basketball Tournament at
the YM&WHA during the week-
ends of March 29-31 and April 5-7.

The tournament annually
draws some of the areas ﬁnest

players including many former
college stars. In addition to the
senior divisions there are also
14-and-under, 16—and-u n d e r,
and 18—and-under sections.

An entrance fee of $20 is re-
quired for teams in the senior di-
vision. Interested persons may get
further information by writing
Lou Goldman at 315 S. Belleﬁeld

. Avenue or calling him at 621-6500.

The deadline for tournament
entries is midnight on March 25.
In order to arrange the ﬁnest
games possible, the Tournament
Committee will seed all teams in

1 each division. Managers will be

notiﬁed by post card sufﬁciently
in advance of their ﬁrst scheduled
game.

Entrance Fee

  Holds Forfeits

To 8 Percent

Forfeits —- the stigma of a good
intramural program -- have been
kept at a minimum this winter in
the basketball program conducted
nightly in the Stadium Gym.

Only eight games in the first  -.
100 scheduled contests have I
been forfeited. The newly en-
dorsed entry fee which was
established this year has been
credited for the'decrease in for-
feits.

The eight per cent forfeiture
rate is still high, however The
Pitt News polled two other schools
and Syracuse University reports __¢.-
less than one per cent in forfeits
and Cincinnati says their rate is
less than three per cent.

Four of the forfeits here have
occurred in the engineering
league, two in the independent
sector, and one in both the dormi-
tory and_ fraternity divisions.
Men’s Dorm Councilhas posted a
notice urging dormitory teams to
fulfill their scheduled obligations.

:_§I)laVe O’Loughlin Ends  
Career With One oss

Squash Star Always
Faced Opponents’ Best
By FRANK SMIZIK
Before the squash team beat
Dickenson, 7-2, in the season
*V__i:1‘):1ale no one on the team had
even won a match except for
Dave O’Lough1in.
O’Loughlin, easily the Pan-

thers’ No. 1 man, had defeated
four of ﬁve opponents —— always
the opponent’s best man -— in a.

season in which his team won

only one contest. The loss was his

ﬁrst collegiate setback in three
years. ‘
.~ -_ He lost to Frank Saitherwaite of

‘Princeton. “It was just one of

those _days when I couldn’t do

"anything right,” O’Loughlin said. '

He did not even consider Saither-

Waite his most formidable‘ foe,

naming Maurice Heckser of Penn

instead;
After Title

This weekend he will try his
hand against the best racqueteers
in thecountry in the Intercol-

“ _ legiate Championships.

“‘ Despite the team's poor show-
ing this year 'when they lost_
three matches by 8-1 scores and A
another by 9-0, O’Loughlin says
there is no reason why this
school can not have good squash
teams. —

“Last year we ﬁnished second
only to Yale in the team cham-
pionships at" the Intercollegiate
Tournament,” he said. “This

, gproves we*c_an have ﬁne teams.”
 Cites Opportunities .

He advanced somereasons: “We
have some of the ﬁnest facilities
in the country,” O’Loughlin said.
“We have ...tennis and squash
scholarships, and because of our
rising academic standards we are
getting more boys from _prep
schools where squash is played
more often.” '

He credits the junior develop-
N -‘xfnent program organized by the

‘(Pittsburgh Squash Racquets
Clubfor his own rise in the
sport.

“Pitt deserves a lot of credit,”
he said, “for letting the partici-
pants in the junior_ development
program use their facilities.”

Cubs Toy Tartans
E, To Finish Season

:" With 5.4 Record

Carl Peterson’s Panther Cubs
ﬁnished their season with on the
Winning Side of the ledger,,de-
feating the Carnegie Tech Jay-
vees, 63--44, Their ﬁnal record is
ﬁve wins and four losses.

‘ The Frosh outscored-' the young
Tartans, 41-24 in the second hal
for the win. '
, John Verkleren, one of Peter-
E”‘"‘§son’s pigskin minded roundball
players, scored 17- points, two
better than guard Nick Gen-
eralovich._

Bob Lovette returned to action
but only scored seven points, his
lowest point output of theyear.

High scorers for Tech were
Johnson and Rudnick, who had 13
and 12 points, respectively.

Baseball Team Practices H aid} , 
With Season Six Weeks Away

Baseball Coach Bobby Lewis leads his team into its third
week of practice today in the Stadium Gym. The accent has
been onhard work as Lewis preps his team for the season
opener, still six weeks away.

“We started earlier this year than usual,” Lewis said,
“so that if an early break in the weather comes we’ll be in
top shape and ready to take ad—¢
vantage of it.”

The vigorous calesthenics pro-
gram that the mitters go through

worked for the Philadelphia Phil-
lies. Wiechec has pzaced particular
emphasis on strengthening .the
ankles and shoulders of the play-
ers.

are ﬁve inﬁelders, four out-

ﬁelders, three pitchers, and one

catcher. .

Letterwinners in the infield are
John Cioﬁi, Ron Supansic, Al
Riccuitti, Paul Martha and Howie
Mallett. Monogram winning
outﬁelders are Corky I Cuthbert,
Barry Wetzel, Dick Wagner, and
Ray Barton.

The three pitchers who earned
letters -last year are John Carl-
isle, ‘Jim Sylvis, and Andy Alex
while Mike Supsura IS the lone
catcher, with playing experience.

The mitters just missed making
the NCAA district playoffs last
year and have set this as their
goal for the 1963 season.»

Plenty of Depth
While the stiﬁ conditioning pro-
gram is to prevent injuries, Lewis
should not be as worried as most
coaches about injuries since his
team has a great deal of depth.
In addition to some talented
newcomers, Lewis can count ‘on
13 lettermen 'from. last year’s

  A Dead Biography and a Dead Novel ,

it 2 Saxe Liked

His Sex

By MATTHEW SWETONIC
’ Count Maurice de Saxe, an 18th
century soldier of fortune,’ ap-5
parently led -a- rather’ interesting
life, however, Jon Manchip White
in his biography Marshall of

“France (Rand McNally; 300 pages;

$6.00) has managed to conceal this
fact rather well in his factually
uninteresting book.

The book takes the reader from
the corrupt and immoral court of
the King of Poland, whisks him
merrily to the steppes of Russia,
confronts him with a bevy of

battles in Belgium, lulls him to
'- sleep

in the boudouirs of Ver-
sailles, but still leaves him gasp-
ing for breath in a bog of bore-
dom and poorly evaluated experi-
ences.

Era of Debauchery

Maurice de Saxe lived in an
era of history when men of royal
birth sold their military andVpoli-
tical talents-to the highest bidder,
and when irresponsible youths
were placed on the thrones of
countries too" weak to resist the
proddings of powerful fathers.

It was an era when loyalty
and patriotism were unknown
terms, and when thousands of
lives were forfeited to please
the whims of self-centered
monarchs. 2

Yet, in a book ﬁlled with strik-
ing examples of all these social
and human irregularities, the
author fails to ﬁnd any thing
wrong with such conduct. He
merely plods on with the bare,
dull facts of existence, and seems
to think that if incest, and adultery,
and murder, and greed, and bast-
ardy was all right for Maurice
de Saxe and hisfriends, then it
should be aceptable to us and we
should not hold their actions
against them. \

Not Critical

If the author is not socially
critical,
when it comes to the talents of
the Count. Maurice dc Saxe was
a-good general, but he was not
the Napoleon that the book makes
him out to be. According to the
author, Saxe never made a mis-
take on the field of battle in his
entire life. Yet he fails to take
into account such minor details
as Saxe’s usual superiority in
numbers, the excellent training of
his troops, the total ineptness of
his opponents, and his failure to

take advantage of the victories he

did win.

This is perhaps the author’s
biggest fault. He has strewn too
many roses in the path of a man
who possessed some talent — but
not a fantastic amount — a man
whose morals were on a pre-h1s_—
toric level, and he has done this

2 hoping that the reader would ac-
vcept Saxe as he sees him and not

as his own [acts portray.
Jon White is a biographer who
has fallen in love with his sub-

' ject and does not have the suffi-

C»

cient skill to cloud the true facts
of his hero’s life.

Pornography
Unpalatable

By MATTHEW NESVISKY

Robert Gover’s best—selling
novel, One Hundred Dollar Mis-
understandivng (Grove Press; 191
pp; $3.95;), is a memorable work
——but only because it is porno-
graphic.

The novel is displeasingly smut-
ty; crude
word here, and, that’s a strong one
in anage in which almost any-
thing goes unblushed at in print.
Author Gover’s two main charact-
ers represent two opposite poles
of morality, but his writing ex-
hibits a lack of adult moral taste
of his own.

The novel is concerned with
the misunderstanding — a hun-
dred potatoes’ worth be-
tween J.C., a budding Babbitt
of a college student, and Kit-
ten,va 14 year-old Negro prosti-
tute. ' I"

The one admirable quality of
the book is that the eventsof the

is probably the best"

plot are told alternately by the
two protagonists. Each gives his
or her own view of the scenes
with an often humorously con-
flicting ﬁrst person voic 9 _'his
technique, although not original,
is sustained evenly throughout the
novel and is its main virtue.

Virtue Lacking
Virtue is lacking in all other
techniques of the ‘book, ‘however.
Kitten’s jangled, low—class Negro
dialect is uneven, unclear and un-
believable. J.C.’s, on the other
hand, comes off as that old Holden
Caulﬁeldese spiked with a ple-
thoga of left-over Faulknerian pa-
rerftheses. ’
In addition, both characters
are combinations of stereotype
and aimless fiction. The author
shows no attempt at either un-
derstanding or presenting the
mind of the Negro, the prosti-
tute, the college student or the
'B’abbitt—to-be. It is, therefore,
incorrect to refer to them as
characters; boring voices is
more ‘accurate.
The failure of characterization
is only surpassed by the shoddy
construction of the plot. It liter-

ally seems that the author made
up the story as he went along,
One cannot really swallow, nor
does he have any desire to do any
swallowing, the ridiculous situa-
tion of a college student ﬁnding
himself in the plush apartment of
a low-class hooker, not knowing
he is supposed to pay for his
weekend’s entertainment.
Unpalatable Scenes 
Equally unpalatable are the
ensuing scenes in which the boy
is given the madam’s Chrysler Im-
perial to play with; in which he ‘is
robbed at knife-point; in which he

returns for his money at gun-
point; and in which ‘he is foiled
and returned home with his
clothes inside-out at drug-point.
But perhapsthe most ridiculous

scene of them all is the ﬁnal oneff

 

in which Kitten decides she’s go-'

ing to give up the business and
go to college to learn how to read.

These ludicrous scenes ——,- inten-
tional and unintentional at the
same time —— add up to a lot of
crudities in language and action,
the only memorable parts of the
book and certainly no recommen-

dation.
