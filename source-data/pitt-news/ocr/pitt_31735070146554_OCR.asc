Chinese Kun opera performed for Pitt students

Dadija Bliudzius I Staff Photographer
Chinese Kun opera performer Xiao Xiangping gives a scaled—down
performance in the Graduate School of Public Health Wednesday.

Shae’ Felicien
For The Pitt News

Xiao Xiangping does his best per-
formances in women’s clothing.

Last night, however, he kept it
simple in an all-black ensemble.

Xiao, who performed at the
Graduate School of Public Health
last night, is most renowned in
China for his work performing
Kun opera as a woman. .

“If a man is going to imperson-
ate a woman, it is considered an
improved art,” Xiao said. “It is
more difficult because he is repre-
senting a man’s ideal woman. You
get more famous that way.”

The Chinese Kun opera star
and Danny Yung, an intercultural
theater specialist, held a lecture
about Chinese performance art.
The Asian Studies Center and the
ethnomusicology program of the
Department of -Music , sponsored
the event.

The lecture featured a selection
of Yung’_s theatrical works and a
live solo demonstration of Kun

V opera by Xiao.

Yung, who titled the lecture
“Journey to the West — Tears of
Barren Hill,” dedicated his work
to Cheng Yanqui, whose life works
and journeys to a Hitler-ruled Ger-
many inspired Yung to reinterpret

‘Yanqui’s original operas decades

later. ,

Xiao, clad in loose—ﬁtted cloth-
ing, danced barefoot on the aus-
tere stage. With calculated arm
gestures, he ﬂuttered a fan rhyth-
mically to the sound of his voice,

which easily reachedthe 22 people

in the audience. He sang with no
accompaniment, and the backdrop
to his performance was a projec-
tor screen that displayed English

subtitles to the aria.

Kun opera is an ancient Chi-
nese opera dating back 600 years
which combines singing, dancing

and gesture to tell a story through ‘

costuming and rhythmic move-
ments.

Xiao, a resident performer

of the Kunqu Opera Museum of
China, has studied opera since he
was 13.

“The biggest difference be-
tween Kun opera and Western
drama is that Western drama can
be very realistic in terms of the

. expressions and the techniques,

but Kun opera is more abstract. It
does not involve a. lot of concrete

Xiao Xiangping:

costumes, detailed makeup and
intricate head pieces, but at the
workshop he focused on giving au-
dience members a more hands—on
display of Kun opera.

Xiao demonstrated the vocal
techniques in both falsetto and ac-
tual voice, encouraging interaction
with a sing-along exercise. Later in
the workshop, Xiao brought the

‘ audience on stage to teach them

a skit.

One pair of students from the
University of Akron in Ohio had
driven two hours to attend the
workshop despite their 7 a.m.
classes on Wednesday.

“My friend from China — she’s

If a man is going to impersonate
a woman, itis considered an

improved art. p

setting, and the techniques are
very abstract,” Xiao said with the
aid of his translator.

The simplicity of Xiao’s perfor-
mance lastnight appealed to Asian
studies scholars.

“Ix dopart of my research on
Chinese opera, and I’ve watched
lots and lots of Chinese opera.

This guy is one of the best people -

that I’ve ever seen,” said Katherine
Carlitz, assistant director of Pitt’s
Asian Studies Center and organizer
for the event.

Xiao performed a scaled—down
demonstration of Kun-opera for a
small crowd Tuesday at a special
theater’ workshop in the Stephen
Foster Memorial building.

Normal attire for Xiao’s per-
formance dictates elaborate

an exchange student from Beijing
— let me know that there was a
workshop today and she didn’t
want to come alone, so I came
with her,” said Grace Kontor, a
sophomore at Akron. “I’m always
interested in theater and anything
international. My major is inter-
national business so I enjoy being
around different cultures.”-

Carlitz, who attended the work- _

shop, said that the small event was
for people who wanted to get on
stage and experience the perfor-
mance, but the lecture would re-
main the “big audience event.”

The lecture was the Asian
Studies Center’s ﬁrst event since
it brought an entire Chinese opera
troupe to Pitt to perform Peony
Pavilion in 2008. I

Opinions

EDITORIAL

Dear KFC, leave

our fat alone

emale fat is attractive. Don’t
let straw—like women parad-
ing on magazine covers de-

ceive you — the way a man can fall
helplessly captivated by the swing-

- ing hips of a voluptuous woman

strolling by is no joke —- it’s fat. .
It’s by artfully displaying their
perfectly proportioned fat depos-
its that for millennia women have
attracted, and exerted power over,
the opposite sex. In his book “Sex,
Time and Power,” esteemed an-
thropologist and author Leonard
Shlain said it best: “Instead of gor-
geous colors, fantastic markings,
sleek hides, sumptuous fur, bright
feathers or polychromatic scales,
Mother Nature decided to use fat”
to “drive a man wild with intoxi-

cated desire.”

This power relationship be-
tween males and females of our
species is uniquely human, and
to take advantage of the attrac-
tive nature of college women’s fat
for proﬁt is not only intrusive, it’s
wrong. So KFC Corporation, throw
away your new marketing cam-
paign before it causes too much
damage.

According to USA Today, the
fast-food chain has devised an
unprecedented way toimarket its
high—calorie, sodium-laced Dou-
ble Down sandwich that replaces
bready buns with two fried chicken
patties. Instead of sticking to the
traditional TV_ ads and billboards,
the company is paying college
women $500 to hand out coupons
while wearing tight—ﬁtting pants.
And — you guessed it -— large let-
ters reading “Double Down” are
plastered on the pants’ behinds.

Understanding the primal pow-
er inherent in the female buttocks,
KFC’s Chief Marketing and Food
Innovation Ofﬁcer John Cywinski

calls his marketing campaign “an
effort to reach  our key target
of young men,” according to the
Huﬂington Post.

It’s one thing to manipulate nat-

- ural, everyday human desire to sell

a product, it’s another to employ
women as advertising commodi-
ties and call it “marketing.” It’s
not like KFC is handing out logo-
emblazoned baseball caps’. They’re
paying students to use their bodies
as human attention—grabbers.

And even if there were a way to
make objectifying women accept-
able — and no such way exists
—— KFC can’t even earn points for
creativity. American writers have
employed, and fully exhausted, the
women-as—meat motif. T

Most of us have seen the “Sein-
feld” episode in which ‘George
Costanza equates sexual desire
— and, by implication, women
—- to food. And we also remem-
ber “A Streetcar Named Desire,”
in which the overconﬁdent buck
Stanley opens the play, both liter-
ally and thematically, by thrusting
a package of meat at his wife Stella.
But just because such values enter-
tain us on stage and the TV screen
doesn’t mean we should accept a
society that condones George and
Stanley, let alone one that advances
their distorted ideals.

For now, KFC is only using
young women at Spalding Uni-
versity in Louisville, Ky., but the
company plans to expand the
campaign to at least three more
campuses. If it comes to Pitt, or
even if it doesn’t, we’ve gained yet
another reason to reduceiour in-
take of fast food.

Let’s not sell our own bodies’ fat
just so a corporation can sell more
of its form of lipid. Our bodies are
just too precious. I

Republicans should  
rethink DADT position

Senate Republicans shoulcl start supporting a ‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell’. repeal

Steve Kaszycki
Columnist

The Senate Republicans have re-
mained ﬁrm in their opposition
to repealing Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell,
the Clinton-era bill banning openly

A gay and lesbian people from serv-

ingin the military. The Republi-
cans would be better off getting
out of the way and concentrating
their energy elsewhere.

Some of the blame falls on

‘Harry Reid, the Democratic Sen-

ate majority leader, who continues
to operate the Senate in a heavy-

A handed, extremely partisan man-

ner. After steamrolling through
Obamacare using tactics that some

Americans found objectionable, _

Reid has continued to behave ob-
stinately, refusing to permit the

GOP to make amendments to the
bill. It is understandably very difﬁ-
cult for the GOP to work with a man
who once called his opponents
“e_vil—.mongers.” Reid has unfor-
tunately disavowed the concepts
of extended debate and reaching
across the political aisle with any-
thing other than a clenched ﬁst.
In the end, however, there are
more pertinent issues for the GOP
to focus on. And there’s little they
have to do on this one other than
not ﬁlibuster. A CNN poll found in
May that 78 percent of Americans
favor repealing Don’t.Ask, Don’t
Tell, a sufficiently large number to
discourage the GOP from trying to
make the matter awedge issue.
For the GOP, like the Demo-
crats, political calculations are
salient. Social conservatives, who
might be less than pleased with the

overwhelmingly economic focus
of Tea Party protesters and candi-
dates, want to discuss something
that actually matters to them —

some of them feel strongly that

permitting openly gay ‘people to
serve in the military would create

an uncomfortable circumstance 5
-for some soldiers. It’s not that their

beliefs aren’t sincere. It’s that the
stories of gay soldiers who openly

THE STAMATTACK

Symbols distract from constructive debate

Nick Stamatakis
Columnist

~

In high school English class, we all’

learn the symbolism traditionally
connected to certain objects. Some-

, times, a snake will signify evil or the

devil. A dove will represent peace.

a Recognizing these associations is

supposed to enhance our reading
and help us better appreciate the
essence of literary works. ‘

Now as riveting as it all is, this
kind of thinking has only the loos-
est actual application to the real
world. Very rarely will a snake in-
dicate an impending murder, and,
to my knowledge, doves don’t actu-
ally appear at the signing of peace
treaties. V

Yet something within us still
makes us seek out symbolism in our
daily lives, whether it is in our per-
sonal or public thoughts. We look

for things that can somehow crys-
tallize whatever vague thoughts we
have into a deﬁnitive picture. These
aren’t just coincidental things like
doves at peace treaties, but they do
often include ridiculously irrelevant
symbolic gestures that tend to gain
a life of their own.

Consider if a hungry McDonald’s
customer decided to order a Big Mac
next to a PETA activist. There is no
meaning behind the decision to or-

der a Big Mac, except that he enjoys ’

his two all-beef patties with special
sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles and
onions on a sesame—seed bun. But
to the activist, or at least to an angry

activist, the symbolism would be .

disgusting —— an insensitive dis-
play of ignorance and arrogance.

I A controversy could possibly start _

and a perfectly meaningless action
suddenly has importance. .

Where this phenomenon is most
detrimental is in politics. In private,

it typically results in nothing more
than a discussion. In public life,
however, it sometimes passes as real
discourse. Angry pundits who are
looking for anything to sink their
teeth into —— especially when there
are no Big Macs around — talk end-
lessly about meaningless symbolism
and stall substantive dialogue. There
is often no real policy implication,
and meaningful debate slows down
to almost nothing.

Take the issue of presiden-

tial leisure. For whatever reason,
. huge symbolism and importance

is often extrapolated from what-
ever the president decides to do.
Dana Perino, George W. Bush’s for-
mer press secretary, said of one of
Barack Obama’s recent vacations
over Memorial Day, “symbolically
that probably was not a very good
choice.” Bush himself quit playing
golf during the war because, in his
words, “playing golf during war

just sends the wrong signal.” Bill
Clinton stopped his high—proﬁle,
_cel'ebrity-ﬁlled vacations because,
as his pollster Dick Morris put it,
“hobnobbing with celebrities” on
the Vineyard was bad for his im-
age.
_ In reality, these leisure decisions
had absolutely no effect on policy.
Our sixth president, John Quincy
Adams, spent his leisure time skin-
ny dipping in the Potomac, but that
didn’t lead him to altering public
indecency laws. Similarly, your de-
cision to vacation in Myrtle Beach
doesn’t lead you to, having any dif-
ferent ideas about the Iraq War.
Instead, all these vacations be-
came encumbering public images
that stunted actual debate. Angry
pundits like Keith Olbermann and
Sean Hannity, looking for some-
thing to be angry about, screamed
about alleged symbolism and mes-

sages. Both men did special reports g

solely on the disgraceful actions of
their opponent. g

It’s not that all these discussions
are necessarily wrong or bad. After
all, the PETA activist has the right
to be legitimately angry, just like the
pundits do. Private outrage is OK.

But government is supposed to
be above this. Somehow attaching
war policy to George Bush’s golf
game or economic policy to Barack
Obama’s vacation gets tiring really
quickly and doesn’t do anything to
move the debate forward.

So is Ronald Reagan ordering
new White House china truly a
meaningful indication of an aris-
tocratically minded president? And
is the fact that Obama can’t bowl
really a symbol of his superiority
complex? Come on. Sometimes, a
snake is just a snake and a clove is

just a dove.

SenateGOP has more important things to do

Kaszycki < 6

The Republican Party has ﬁnite’

resources and ﬁnite media oppor—.
tunities, and wastingtime defend-
ing a measure that will inevitably
be overturned —— probably sooner
rather than later —— is a signiﬁcant
blunder.

Obamacare, or the Patient Pro-
tection and Affordable Care Act of
2009, remains a highly unpopular
statute +' a Rasmussen poll indi-
cates that only 33 percent of likely
voters think it’s good for the coun-
try. Republicans should capitalize
on the fact that the law’s opposition
stretches across the lines of the
conservative sectors —— economic

conservatives, social conservatives
and moderates object to. it.
There are some counterargu—
ments to be wary of ‘as well. Op-
ponents of the DADT provision
deserve critique "as well and should
be careful in their campaigning.
Contrary to what their rhetoric
often suggests, there is no intrin-

sic “right” to serve in the armed A

forces —— the U.S.‘military is an
institution that can set its own
guidelines according to what aids
it in accomplishing its goals. That’s
why the military is not required
to enlist people with disabilities,
whom it is illegal to discriminate

against elsewhere in society. The
same goes for obese people, etc.
The obvious difference is that
being gay doesn’t prevent one
from being a good soldier. But

the military, and preventing gay
persons from being able to serve
without having to camouﬂage their
sexual preference does not con-
tribute to a strengthened military.‘

Wastingtime defending a measure .
that will inevitably be overturned is

this is where the crux of the case
for overturning Don’t Ask, Don’t
Tell resides: It’s not that there is
a right to serve, it’s that restric-
tions should work to strengthen

asigniﬁcant blunder.

Instead, it weakens it, robbing it of
qualiﬁed soldiers.

As far back as the early ’9os,
there were some conservative
voices in favor of permitting gays

and lesbians to openly serve in
the military —most notably for-
mer presidential candidate Barry
Goldwater, who declared, “I see
no harm at all with‘ having gays
in the military.” It makes sense
from a conservative perspective:
Why have needless government
restrictions? ‘ '

Going forward, the proper fol-
low-up to a repeal of Don’t Ask,
Don’t Tell would involve politicians
working with and listening to the

~ active duty commanding ofﬁcers

in the military.

‘Jewtopia’ plays with stereotypes

Sarah Simkin

Bryan Fogel had a problem. The size
of the cast required for “Jewtopia,” a
play he created and starred in, made
touring impossible.

He found his solution in “World
ofjewtopia,” a 90-minute, one-act
show combining the humor of the
longest running off-Broadway com-
edy with stand-up, audience partici-
pation and multimedia.

“jewtopia” follows a Catholic man
and ajewish man as they each search
forjewish wives. “World ofjewtopia”
combines scenes from “jewtopia”
with more than 200 slides and video
clips, as well as the standup.

“‘]ewtopia’ was purely a play and
this is kind of — to put it cheesily —
a multimedia extravaganza!” Fogel
said of the adaptation. 6

“World ofjewtopia” includes two

scenes from “jewtopia,” which he
wrote with Sam Wolfson, who is also
Jewish. The ﬁrst is the opening of
the original play, in which a gentile
decides he wants to marry ajewish
girl so that he’ll never have to make
another decision in his life. He en-
lists the help of his childhoodjewish
friend in navigating “jewtopia,” the
popularjewish dating service J Date.

‘ Fogel acts the scene with the assis-

tance of actorjeremy Rishe.

The second scene explores that
process —— speciﬁcally the details
of passing oneself off as ajew, such
as slipping Yiddish into one’s vo-
cabulary and the ﬁne art of com-
plaining.

In addition to those scenes, there
is a stand-up comedy portion of the
show that features interaction with
the audience.

“We have all these games that we
play and people shout things out. We
do a Q—and—A, read transcripts of
phone conversations with our moms
and selections of the book [‘]ewto—
pia: The Chosen Book for the Chosen
People,’ also by Fogel and Wolfson.]
It’s a crazy interactive show — like a
Jew rollercoaster,” Fogel said.

Not the least of the participation
opportunities for the audience is a
game show, featuring the schematic

Bob Marley’s family celebrates him in concert

Thirty years after his final performnce, which took place in Pittsburgh, Marley ’s family will commemorate his life with a show

Jordan Streussnig
Staﬁ" Writer

Bob Marley Celebration —
30 Years Later

The Marley Family
Benedum Center

Today, 7 p.m.
412-456-6666

Tickets $38.75-52.57

Thirty years ago, the voice of
the legendary reggae perform-

er Bob Marley rang out over a
crowd of his devotees for the
last time in concert here in
Pittsburgh at the Stanley The-
atre, known today as the Ben-
edum Center.

Today, on Sept. 23 — the
anniversary of Marley’s final
performance — his family will
take to the Benedum Center
stage to revive his voice, cel-
ebrate his legacy and support
his lifelong mission — peaceful

and conscientious living for all A

mankind.

Ed Traversari, producer of
the upcoming show, is experi-
encing a sort of déja vu in pre-
paring for the celebration — he
was also a producer of Bob Mar-
ley’s final performance.

“It’s been a passion of some
of us who were at that show
in 1980 to see a show like this
come to Pittsburgh to celebrate
Bob Marley. Not a lot of people

know that his last performance
took place in Pittsburgh,” Tra-
versari said.

He said producers started
tossing around the idea of a
tribute show about 10 years
after the 1980 performance.

“We thought about it for a
while and-were considering do-
ing it aroundvthe 25-year mark,”
he said. V ; a A

But planning the show turned
out to be quite a bit ofwork and

they needed more time to “pull
all the pieces together,” Traver-

' sari said.

Finally, after 30 years, the
Marley family will join together
to commemorate their rela-
tive and show Pittsburgh how
much his music can still move
at room. Family members thus
far confirmed to be taking part
in the performance include his
daughter, Cedella, along with
her group The Marley Girls;

ALBUM REVIEW

Band’s name misleading

Liz Keeney

Staﬁ’ Writer
Sweet Nasty
Life on Fire
Stereophonic Records
Grade: C-

Rocks like: Drive-By Truckers, Phish,
The Black Crowes

Contrary to its name, the Prescott, Ariz.—
based band Sweet Nasty is neither sweet nor
nasty. The band promises to include “sweet
ballads that tear you apart and those nasty
grooves that get you moving” on its sopho-
more album, Life on Fire. But Sweet Nasty is
blandly catchy at its best and downright bor-
ing and uninspired the rest of the time.
Following in the vein of other jam-band
groups such as Phish and Sublime with a

«down-home country vibe, Sweet Nasty tries

to create a mellow sound. Ideally, it should
be perfect for a backyard barbecue-or an
afternoon smoke session. Instead of creat-
ing background music, however, most songs
are easy to ignore — and at times you even
forget that there is music on at all.

While vocalists Anthony V. Fusco’s and

Johnny Low’s voices do have an interesting

twang to them that is mirrored well by the
rest of the band’s instruments, they would
most likely translate better into a live per-
formance than an album.

The main issue with Life on Fire is that no '

matter how interesting a lead singer’s voice
is, if the lyrics are as generic and ultimately
pointless as Sweet Nasty’s are, it becomes
too hard to sell. On tracks such as “Midnight
Train to Austin,” the lyrics are. just shy of
cliché. Throw in a long walk down a lonely
road and some teardrops on your guitar and
they’d be downright cheesy. '
Other than an awkwardly suggestive
name, Sweet Nasty has little to offer lis-

- teners. I

people can relate to “World ofjewtopia.”

ries in a 38-16 win over New
Hampshire last game, stealing
the spotlight from teammate
Dion Lewis.

Wannstedt said he has not
planned how much playing time
each back will receive against No.
19 Miami, which also has a 1-1
record at the moment.

“We don’t have anything dif-
ferent for Dion than we do for

A Ray. They’re both interchange-

able,” he said while tonight’s
home game. “We’ll go in this-*
week knowing that they’re both
going to -play, but with no speciﬁc
plan that Dion will get so many
carries, and Ray will get so many
carries. If we get a hot hand, w_e’ll
play the hot hand.”

‘ Both backs haverushed for
two touchdowns this season, but
Lewis has averaged just 2.9 yards
per carry compared to 5.5 yards
per carry last year.

Miami, like Pitt, has a wealth
of running backs at its disposal. "‘

The Pitt women’s basketball

and it looks to be one the teams’
toughest in recent memory.

In addition to its challenging
Big East schedule, which includes

the Panthers also have a daunting
nonconference schedule.

They will host traditional
powerhouse Duke on Nov. 24
after traveling to Minneapolis
to kick off the season on Nov. 17

in the Big Six ‘Challenge against _

Minnesota.
“This is the most challenging

schedule that we’ve ever had,” .

Pitt coach Agnus Berenato said
in a news release. “We start off
injanuary by playing four of our
first five conferencegames on

“Whitewood adjusting to life in America W5" 

PITTNEWS.

Lauren Kirschman -

Senior Staff Writer

For many freshmen, going to college means
ﬁlling every space in their parents’ car with
boxes, driving a few hours to their dorms,
and perhaps even going home the ﬁrst
possible weekend to cure the onslaught of
homesickness. _ A '
But for Pitt volleyb all player Krista
Whitewood, it meant getting on a plane

in New Zealand and drop her a world away

in a brandnew country and the city of Pitts— *

,.burgh. ‘ —

“[1 miss] myfamily and all my friends 
and just everything and everyone I know,”
said Whitewood, a freshman. “Coming to
America, you just kindof have to make all
those connections again. And it’s not like
I can just run around the corner to go see
them as they are all the way on the other
side of the world.” »

Whitewood received interest from vol-
leyball programs in the United States after

—-‘Pitt, St. Louis, Syracuse and Indiana.
Pitt head coach Toby Rens said White-

jwood’s passion and enthusiasm for the game

made him want to make her a Panther.
“Her ability and potential as a leader is

great, too,” Rens said. “Her work ethic is"

great. Those are things we were certainly

looking for. Everybody had nothing but re- '

ally positive things to say about her.”
Whitewood made her visits t_o the
schools in April and eventually decided
on Pitt. Two months later, she arrived on
campus for summerschool and training.‘
‘“It may be considered cliche, but I actu-
ally chose Pitt b_ecaus‘e,.whenI came on my

visit, I completely fell in love with the cam— '
pus, the people and the volleyball team,”

she said. “I could really just see myself going
here as a‘Pitt student—athlete.” - '
Whitewood said living in Pittsburgh

she said. “That’s one thing Inoticedthat,

She added that the biggest difference,

she noticed between ‘New Zealand and the A

everything from food portions to cars just
seems bigger in America. ,_
“In New Zealand, everything just seems

Pitt looking to maintain
abalanced offense

Foptball 4 15

Lucas Felakl Senior Staff Photographer

Jon Baldwin will try and pick up where he left off against New Hafnplshire and have

the freshman, Lamar Miller.”

Miller ran back a kickoff 88 yards for
a touchdown against Ohio State during
Miami’s last game. Wannstedt called him
“the biggest and the fastest of them all,”
and said that special teams will play a
major role in Thursday’s game.

“With the extra days we put some em-
phasis on the special teams, particularly
with things that we need to clean up,” he
said. “Earlier in the season, we know that
special teams are always a big determining
factor in wins or losses.” ' -

In addition to special teams, Pitt fo-
cused on Miami quarterbackjacory Har-
ris, whopthrew for 3,352 yards last year and
led Miami to its best season since 2005.

“You can see [Harris] on film making
all the throws,” Wannstedt said. “He can
throw from sideline to sideline. He can
throw deep very accurately. He forces
you to defend the whole field without a
doubt.” ' -

Harris, however, struggled two weeks

ago at No. 2 Ohio State. The Buckeyes.

picked him off four times and sent the

Hurricanes home with a 36-24 loss.
Meanwhile, Pitt’s Tino Sunseri bounced

back against New Hampshire and threw

another 100-yard receiving game.

for 275 yards with two touchdowns and
one interception. Despite the successful
performance, Wannstedt cautioned that
he does not want to abandon focusing on
his offense’s balance.

“I like where Tino Sunseri is going, but
we have to be careful that we don’t fall in a
trap,” he said. “We can’t go out and be one-
dimensional. We can’t go out and win a big
game being only one-dimensional.”

Wannstedt also announced a bit of
lighter news at his press conference, ear-
lier. this week. .

The Turn It Blue campaign popularized
with last season’s home victory over Notre
Dame will return tonight. Panther fans

‘are encouraged to wear blue for the most

anticipated home football game since last
year’s heartbreaking loss to Cincinnati.

Wannstedt said up to 350 former Pan-
thers will participate in pre- and post-
game events, and the Alpha Kappa Psi
professional business fraternity sold out
500 blue “We Will Rock U” T-shirts.

“IfI could go back and order 2,000
shirts, I would do it in a heartbeat,” said
Pitt student Adam Fasullo, creator of the
Facebook event for the sale. 3

Whitewood feeling at home on Pitt volleyball team

Volleyball 1 16

isn’t homesick yet. She said having a team
around deﬁnitely helped her adjust.

“I think if you’re on the volleyball team
or any sports team at Pitt, you’re really

Klucky as your teammates almost become’

your family and you can make some re-
ally great friends,” she said. “You’re always
spending a lot of time together.”

Before joining her teammates in Amer-
ica, Whitewood had a successful volleyball
career in her home country and is consid-
ered one of the top volleyball players ever
to come out of New Zealand.

“The potential of her a1l—around game
is great,” Rens said. “That could be one
of her greatest strengths —— her ability to
stay dialed in. Every skill is really good

._,already.”

He said that Whitewood is a strong
server and is very focused. He added that
the freshman is at a very good level for her
ﬁrst year of college play,

“The more she’s able to work in a team
setting and develop her game technical-
ly, the better she’ll get,” Rens said. “She
could potentially be a great ﬁt for our pro-
gram.”

Whitewood was the captain of the New
Zealand Youth National Volleyball Team
where she played in the 2010 Asian Youth

Girls’ Volleyball Championships in Ma-

‘ laysia.

She counts that experience as one of
her favorite volleyball moments. She said
her team was placed in a pool with No. 1
seed Japan. They got knocked out 3-0 in
pool play and Japan went on to win the
tournament. But Whitewood said getting
the opportunity to'watch]apan’s best player
made the experience memorable.-

Whitewood said the player, Mari Horika—

Toby Rens:

her like ‘Wow, this is the reason why I want
to continue playing volleyball. I want to be
just like her.’ She was that good.”

From there, Whitewood said she gained
the conﬁdence and motivation to come to
America, in hopes of improving both as a
player and as a person.

“This right—side hitter from japan was
just so good, she became my idol,” White-
wood said.

_So far her experience with the Pitt vol-

wa — who was ranked as the top spiker
in .the world for her age group and was
eventually named the tournament’s Most
Valuable Player — was one of the best play-
ers she’d ever seen.

“Every time she went up to hit you
couldn’t help but watch, like, in ﬁlll amaze-
ment,” Whitewood said. “She was just awe-

leyball team has been great, Whitewood
said. She started conditioning with lifting,
running and light training in the summer
and is now into the full swing of the sea-
son. .
Whitewood started playing volleyball
because both of her parents played —— they
actually met through the sport. Her parents
coached a high school boys’ team when

Whitewood was about 4 years old, so she
hung around the gym, trying to join in the
drills and spike in the hitting lines.

She said that she traveled with the team
to nationals and tournaments and would
sit on the bench, watching the wins and
the rough patches.

“It was here that, as a little girl, I grew a
passion for the game,” Whitewoodsaid. “I
just knew that I wanted to play this sport.
I wanted to spike like the boys  with my
parents being so involved with the sport,
I was just lucky that they could help me
achieve all that I wanted to.”

Whitewood said the passion she has for

 , the game is one of the qualities that help

deﬁne a great player.

“You need to be hard-working, you need
to know the game inside and out and most
importantly, you need to not just play the
game, but you need to do it with a passion,”
she said. “And I think that these are some
of my best strengths.”

Whitewood hasn’t declared a major yet,
although she said that she’s considering
industrial design. Whatever she decides,
she knows she wants to keep volleyball in
her life after college.

“Whether it be playing the sport I love
or teaching it to others, it doesn’t matter as
long as I’m in it somehow,” she said. I
