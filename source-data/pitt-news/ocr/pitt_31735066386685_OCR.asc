RSC aims to monitor
SGB reserve fund

By Maureen Dorney
Sta_[7'W1°iter

The Representative Student
Council plans to be the
“watchdog” of the expenditures
that the Student Government
Board will make with the money
from the reserve fund.

Money from the reserve fund is
used for one-time expenses that
will have long—term benefits for
undergraduate students. Some
-expenditures have included the
brightly colored neon panther
sign in the William Pitt Union and
funding for Telefact.

“We should do something to
stop this. The money is there but
being misused,” said RSC
Chairperson Mike Golden.

Board members Sharon Kuhn

and Kris Keefer drafted a
resolution to deal with what the
RSC sees as the misuse of these
funds. The resolution states that
any proposed purchase over
$10,000 should be shown to the
RSC. Two-thirds of the
participating undergraduate-
student voters would then have
to approve it by a referendum
voting system.

“It’s our money, and we should
get a say in how it is used,” Kuhn
said.

RSC then moved to open floor
time. The open floor is a chance
for student groups to voice their
complaints. Wednesday’s meeting
focused on the 1990 SGB and the
Student Health Advisory\_Board.

Venezuelan economy
gains from Gulf Crisis

By Jennifer Spiro
Staf/‘IVriter

Venezuela’s economy is
cashing in on an increased market
for its oil because of the Persian
Gulf crisis, said General Counsel
of Venezuela Raul Itriago-Toro
last Saturday night.

Itriago-Toro, an ambassador of
Venezuela, spoke at Venezuela
Night, which was presented by
the Caribbean Association of
Pittsburgh and the Caribbean and
Latin American Students
Association.

“Venezue1a’s oil-production
capacity today is 100,900,000
barrels a day. By the end of this
year, we estimate that the

production will increase up to 2
million barrels a day,” said Itria go-
T oro.

The Gulf crisis in the Middle
East will help the country’s
growing economy considerably,
he said.

“Because of the Gulf crisis and
since Iraq invaded Kuwait,
Venezuela will be obtaining an
extra revenue of 2 billion [dollars]
by the end of this year,” said
Itriago—Toro.

A large portion of that profit
will come from the gas consumers
in the United States.

New student group hopes to legalize hemp

By Jennifer Swoboda
Staf/‘W71-iter

Approximately 40 people gathered in Room
609 of the William Pitt Union on Saturday at

A 8 p.m. for the first organizational meeting of

Help End Marijuana Prohibition.

Dan Waterman Meekins, president of HEMP,
said the group is organizing around the effort
to end the prohibition of all the uses of the
hemp plant, not just its recreational use.
Meekins said this was the first meeting to be
recognized by the university.

“[I would] like to welcome any student
who’s for, opposed or unsure about the issue
of the legalization of hemp to come to our
meeting or approach me about ideas. We’re
not going to preach to anyone. I feel the
university is the perfect place for exchanging
ideas,” Meekins said.

Also addressing the assembled group was
the Lone Reefer, a member of the Pittsburgh
chapter of the National Organization for the
Reform of Marijuana Laws. The Lone Reefer
said that the only way to overcome all the
negative attitudes about hemp‘ is through
education.

The Lone Reefer passed out literature about
the hemp plant and all its uses. He said that
hemp paper processing is cheaper and less

polluting than wood—pulp paper processing.
He also said that hemp can be grown for
biomass fuel, and the methanol from hemp
could replace oil from the Middle East.

He added that the seedcake remaining after
pressing hemp for oil is a complete vegetable
protein second only to soybean cake in
nutrition.

The Lone Reefer emphasized the power of
the pen in terms of writing politicians and
urged people to let their Congressional
representatives know how they feel about the
legalization of hemp.

Steve Courson, a member of the Safe Drug
Coalition and a former Pittsburgh Steeler,
spoke of the need for more drug education at

the meeting.

Courson said, “Part of living in a free
society is free choice. In our society we want
to punish people for using drugs before we
rehabilitate them.”

Courson said he goes to different schools
to speak to students about drug education,
and he hears from many principals that they
don’t have a drug problem at their schools.
Courson said they are either arrogant or
naive in saying this. He said the drug problem
in this country is pushed under the rug.

According to Courson, the government
“uses misinformation to control us and keep
us uneducated” in terms of the harms of
drugs.

Courson said he finds it ironic that the
government pours so much money into a
campaign against whatit calls harmful drugs
when the drugs that kill most Americans are
tobacco and alcohol. Courson added that no
one has ever died from a marijuana overdose.

Meekins said that sometime in February
the group will hold elections for officers and
on Feb. 19 there will be a panel discussion
in the David Lawrence Auditorium on drug
and alcohol education,

HEMP is also planning to hold a benefit
concert with several Pittsburgh bands around
Feb. 23 in the William Pitt Union.

Shelter teaches Women to reco

By Karen D. Speece
Senior Staff Writer

Representatives of the Women's
Center and Shelter of Pittsburgh
educated students on types of
dating and marital violence during
a Greek 101 seminar Thursday.

“One in four marriages suffers
ongoing‘ violence. This violence
is used day to day in the home,”
Janet Scott—Metz, training director
of the women’s shelter, said

Violence usually begins when
the relationship begins. One in
five college relationships will ex-
perience violence, said Metz.

The thought that the man really
loves her or that she owes him
something, low self-esteem, love
for him or past abuse during her

childhood can cause women to
stay with an abusive spouse or
mate. The man's looks, popularity
and the rationality that life isn’t
always bad are other reasons for
the tolerance of ongoing abuse.

A video, A Fatal Attraction,
expressed a type of violence that
ended in an attempted first—degree
murder and attempted suicide.

Sixty-ﬁve percent of men who
batter women are not insane, and
the other 35 percent will beat up
anyone, not just women,
according to Metz.

Many types of abuse can occur
in a relationship.

“Violence is more than physical
 It’s not hereditary; it’s a learned
behavior,” Metz said. Jealousy,
possessiveness and restraint are

all warning signs of forthcoming
abuse.

Verbal abuse, one of the rnildest
forms of abuse, leads a woman to
feel inadequate and inferior to
others, according to Metz. Mental
abuse emotionally lowers self-
esteem and psychologically
causes the person to doubt what
is real. “When you are in an
abusive relationship, it’s more
about control than physical
violence  When I was a child
and my father or mother spanked
me, I didn’t say ‘Oh, thank you. I

understand now,’ I was just
angry," Metz said.

At the women’s shelter, a
women is never told not to return
to her home. She is educated in
the three-step cycle of violence.
First, in the tension phase, ev-
eryone walks on eggshells so
that the abusive party will not be
aggravated. In the second phase,
acute battering, the actual
violence occurs. After the vio-
lence, the abuser will go through
a “honeymoon” phase where
everything will seem perfect but

gnize pre-abuse behavior

leads gradually back to the tension
phase, according to Metz.

A woman is empowered at the
shelter, not told what to do, Metz
said. She is taught to recognize
what happens before her mate
becomes violent, so that she can
get away before any violence
occurs. Having extra sets of
apartment and car keys, copies
of her and her children’s birth
certiﬁcates and some spare money
for a cab, phone and hotel are
also essential components in this
plan, according to Metz.

Funny

Continued from page 1

Jose Dominguez slapped his
hands, wrists and arms together
to provide the backup beat for
partner Matt Diulus, who rapped
his own version of the theme to
“The Beverly Hillbillies.” The
first
performed their act during an
anatomy lab, according to Diulus.
The duo’s audience was a little
more lively this time around.

Other hopefuls found more
original ways to use their bodies.

Andy Boguslawski, a junior at
Pitt, transformed himself into a
human ﬂagpole, annoying
passing motorists on Forbes
Avenue but delighting the
spectators.

Lyn—Michelle Truss performed
an outrageous remake of Marvin
Gaye and Tammi Terrel's "I’m a
Little Ole Girl and I'm a Little Ole
Boy" in ‘front of a horde of
screaming Steeler fans ouside
Three Rivers Stadium. Watch for
this one.

Steve Hilderhoff alternately
became a convincing chicken and
a snarling bulldog. Dinsmore
asked him to repeat the bulldog
act with a slight addition:
Hilderhoff was told to charge the
camera and stick his head through
one of the fence-like partitions in
the William Pitt Union Concourse

‘ Lounge.

“My parents are going to be so
proud of me,” he quipped.

Bryan Beatty, a senior physics
major, raced through a rendition
of Tom Lehrer’s “‘The Elements”

while juggling and riding a
unicycle. THAT was a tough act
to follow.

But, follow they did.
Impersonators, comedians and
even a magician showed up to
stake their claims for the $10,000
awarded to the “A.F.P. ” weekly
grand-prize winner.

Dinsmore said the tapes made
this weekend would be reviewed
this week and that some of the
clips might be seen on the
program as early as Dec. 9. He
added that some bits might be
saved for later in the season or
for special montage sequences
that are created periodically.

“Everyone who makes the
show will be notified,” he said.

Of all the clips selected for an
episode, five are chosen to have
representatives in the studio
audience during the filming of a
show. These selections are made

by Vin Di Bona Productions,
named for the mastermind behind

l“A.F.P.” and its parent show,

“America’s Funniest Home
Videos.”
The producers also narrow the
five nominees down to three,
based on the response of the
studio audience. The final

selection process is conducted

by votes cast by the studio,

audience.

“You can’t take [rejection] too
personally,” said John Laurina, a
part-time student in Pitt’s College
of General Studies. Laurina said
that he felt lucky just to have the
opportunity to audition.

“How often do big-time shows
come to the cafeteria of a major
university?” he asked.

Just how “bi g” is the show? Last
week, “America’s Funniest
People” was ranked No. 4 in the
country, drawing in over 30

“We have overtaken l‘America’s

Dinsmore with a grin.

Dinsmore attributes the success
of the show to the number of
what he calls “closet comedians”
in the world. These people can
not or do not make a living out of
being funny but have legitimate
talent, according to Dinsmore

He added that a lot of times this
talent goes unrecognized except
by the small audience the typical
closet comedian actually meets.

“Now, there’s another outlet,”
said Dinsmore.

Sam Simon, 27, thought of at

least one other reason for the
show’s success.

“This would be a good national
break  for aspiring performers,”
he said.

Dinsmore’s search for funny
people has taken him all over the
country, so he has seen a lot of
acts. His picks for the funniest
acts NOT used on the air were a
person who passed gas on cue
(to the tune of “Old MacDonald,”
no less!) and a person who, after
sticking a piece of red licorice up
one nostril and pulling it out of
his mouth, flossed.

Said Dinsmore, “We shot them,
anyhow  for the office.”

the ACHD considers dietary fat to
be a potential contributor to

 

cancer.

“Recent information on breast
cancer indicates that fat in the

involved in cancer,’ said Nolan.

Although the incidence of
breast cancer is on the rise, the

A reserve fund regulator...

When the Student Government Board operates under a
budget, the rest of the money allocated for its use goes
into a reserve fund. Unfortunately, this year’s SGB has
misappropriated this fund to the extent that many of its
uses do not benefit the students and are, in fact, useless.
But now there is a group on campus which will be willing
to make sure that this fund is not exploited by the SGB

The Representative Student Council, comprised of all
student groups on campus, has declared that it will be
riﬂits..t9.t2.€.3:rV3£st1.d.98’i.0r2:E1?.r€S:=I;V.<3 fund; Under
a resolution proposed by the RSC, the SGB would have
to get RSC approval in order to use this fund as a resource
for anything over $10,000. -

Until now, the SGB has had unlimited authority over
drawing from the reserve fund. Many times, however, it
has not acted in the students’ best interests when doing
this.

An example of this would be the Cathedral of Learning
bus shelter, which is currently under construction at the
corner of Fifth Avenue and Bigelow Boulevard. This

“shelter, when completed, would be able to sufficiently

protect eight to 10 people from the elements while
waiting for a bus. ,

But the SGB, when allocating this money, did not
consult with student groups to see if they felt the shelter
was feasible or if it would be worth the price. The SGB
went ahead with the funding without asking for student
opinion on the project. This shelter ended up costing the

' reserve fund a whopping $15,000 toward a seemingly

unworthy cause.

Another example of the SGB using this fund without
consultation would be the funding of T elefact. SGB spent
$42,000 on this system without asking the student body
if Telefact was even wanted on campus. Now the SGB
must find the appropriate funding to keep this service in
business.

With the RSC as a supervisory group over the reserve
fund, such rnisappropriations and mistakes could be

avoided in the future. This will place a sort of natural"

check on the SGB so that it does not become a more
despotic system than it already is.

As a student organization, the RSC does not hold much
authority over the student body. This is better for the
students, as it will give them a voice in government
procedure without giving them another autocratic
government. Allowing the RSC to oversee the allocation
of the reserve fund will be a step toward keeping the
reserve from going to simple pet projects of SGB members.

Keep unions off of the campus

There is a great deal of
discussion on campus regarding
the recent decision of the
Pennsylvania Labor Relations
Board to allow a vote for
collective unionization of full-
time Pitt faculty and librarians.
Even though much has been
said, I do not believe the entire
story has been told. No one as of
this time has spoken about the
harm that may be done to the
faculty by unionization, especially
the 46.8 percent who voted
against unionization in the last
Vote.

Should union representation
be approved for the faculty
(probably by as slim a margin as
the last vote), every faculty
member would have to be treated
equally by the administration in
matters ranging from salary,
workload and facilities to such
piddling matters as parking and
office space.

While this may sound very
nice and equitable, it is also
obvious that certain professors
may publish more, be better
lecturers or accomplish more in
their research than others.
Allowing the university freedom

A to attract and keep better

professors through certain
financial and non-financial
rewards is the best way to ensure
that the faculty can fully serve
the students of the university and
the community.

Those faculty members (289 of
them) who voted against
unionization in 1987 probably
realize this. Many also realize
that unions in general in recent
years have been far more
interested in their political

  

 

 

Rob
Lewis

agendas as set by the union
leadership than in the genuine
welfare of their rank—and—file
members. This was amply
demonstrated several years ago
when the AFL—CIO attempted to
place a pro-choice plank in its
platform. A concerted grass-roots
effort among the rank and ﬁle led
AFL—CIO President Lane Kirkland
and the rest of the leadership to
finally abandon this effort.
Some faculty members of this
university face a problem many
other people have faced for the
last hundred years: having to go
along with an organization they
are forced to join and support
financially even if they feel that
they are opposed to most of the
precepts and actions of the
organization. This would seem to
me to violate the Constitution as
well as the Universal Declaration
of Human Rights, which states
that nobody shouldbe compelled
to join any organization against
his or her will. The high-minded
liberals who endorsed this
wonderful sentiment, though,

seem to look the other way when
this prohibition could easily be
applied to trade unions.

Many unions have resorted to
violence to further their agendas.
William Winpisinger, president
of the Machinists Union, said that
“sometimes, when  you got a
brick in your hand, you have to
throw it. Then it’s up to the union
lawyers to get you out.” Even the
college-educated rank and file of
the National Education
Association was implicated in 106
incidents of violence between
1975 and 1988, according to the
National Institute for Labor
Relations Research.

There is only one solution to
this mess. Legislation to prohibit
forced association with a trade
union (known as “right—to—work
laws”) that have proved very
successful in several states should
be passed at least in Pennsylvania
and at best in Washington, D.C.
Such laws generally provide for
all businesses to be “open” shops
that may hire both union and
non—union members, with the
non-union members negotiating
their own contracts. If such a law
were in place now in
Pennsylvania, those faculty who
opposed union representation
would not have an organization
they opposed crammed down
their throats, and the threat of a
strike that could close down the
university would be greatly
diminished. Such an arrangement
would benefit all, except perhaps
those who use unionization to
advance certain issues or enhance
their own power.

should be based. I have realized, however,
that my ideas of the way life should be are
not universal and that there must always
be room for different views.

Democracy supposedly exists when the
ultimate power of the government lies
within the people. A democratic
government is required to have the support

‘and participation of ordinary citizens.

‘ Subsequently, this should mean that the
“rules” or laws of this democratic state are
written to suit the common people. These
laws should be fair in all aspects and give
respect to the ideals of every citizen
within that state. It most certainly should
not represent a speciﬁc, biased point of
view.

Unfortunately though, our government
no longer implements the Constitution at

2‘ face value. Instead, those people in

positions of authority are interpreting the
Constitution of the United States, rather
than making decisions which represent its
true meaning.

Legislature is no longer being formed
through objective eyes but through ones
which dictate how people should or should
not act.

As a Christian, I believe that the

""~Constitution is formed and based on

Christian morals and values. But what is
one to do if he or she is not Christian?

Even if the majority of people living in
the United States are Christian, the
government should still represent all the
pe,opl§;.A§l,?,en_1er_r1_berg that the definition of
“Christian” is not always uniform and
always quite debatable.)

The true question here is not about

~,.,(being a good Christian or even what being
a Christian entails; rather, it is about the
infringement upon people's rights that
our government is making. Understandably
so, the government should protect all of
its citizens from others who may cause
harm or detriment.

For example, it is reasonable that murder
is against the law. But why is it so
understandable that burning a flagis also?

Wait, don’t get upset. I fervently love

Hornfeck

my country, and I appreciate the rights I
have. I realize that there are many people
who would love to have the rights which
Americans have, but there is something
that must be recognized and understood
by all.

The bolstering of nationalist ideals by
the government is no excuse to be able to
gradually take away our rights. The
government is not only building its power
over the the entire sovereign state, but it
is building its power to unfairly determine
our rights as citizens.

With this same respect, musicians and
artists are being given an ever-tightening
constriction on what is acceptable and not
acceptable to the public (e.g. Robert
Mapplethorpe and 2 Live Crew).

It is understandable that the government
does not wish to see the entire value
system of society decline. The only
question left is: Where should intervention
begin?

Through the Bill of Rights, we are given
freedoms of speech and expression. If the
government has the power and authority
to censor what it feels is detrimental to the
public, then the definition of freedom will
never become consistent.

Organizations everywhere should stop
fighting against each other and stop
quarreling about their own beliefs. Instead,
each should combine to form a unified
voice which could force the government
to uphold the true Constitution of the
United States (not the one in which the
individual interpreters choose to see).

The role of the government is to support
and defend its citizens along with the
beliefs of its citizens. The government
should stop trying to dictate to us how we
should or should notlact, according to
individual, biased beliefs.

If I recall correctly, the United States is
a democracy, not a dictatorship.

Pitt News

There’s always a lot of talk at Pitt
about what’s missing: harmony among
students and faculty, equal
representation, maid service for suites
and an effective recycling plan. Oh
yeah, —-— and a quiet place to study.

That’s right. Have you ever found a
quiet place to study at night that stays
open late? Let me know if you have,
because I really need to know.

Sure, Hillman Library is OK — if you
go there first thing in the morning when
it opens. But as the day wears on, that
library, which I swear was designed to
double as an echo chamber, gets more
chaotic. I just love it when people next
to you whisper, like they are doing you
a real favor. Noise is noise and always
distracting. Which reminds me — did
you ever notice that the employees are
the loudest? The other day I was
attempting some sort of academic
achievement when this older, well-
dressed woman who obviously worked
there yelled from the elevators to the
office down the hall, “Hey Mary, the
coffee’s ready!”

One advantage is those great chairs
that are not comfortable enough to
sleep in but too comfortable to study in.
Of course, you have to get there at
about 2 p.m.to get a seat before the
rush. Fortunately, the library starts to
quiet down about 1 1 pm. Unfortunately,
it closes at midnight.

The Cathedral of Learning Commons
Room, with its dim lighting, high ceilings
and hardwood furniture, may have that
aura of academia, but don’t let that fool
you. Chances are that you’ll leave there

, with diminished visual ability, the aroma
of cigarettes lingering on all your
belongings, a skin condition or stomach
problem from your nine trips to the
vending machines and a spinal disorder
from the medieval—inspired furniture.
T 0 top it all off, only a fraction of your
homework will get done. Since it's not
a library, no one even attempts to be
quiet. And with those concrete walls
and stone ﬂoors for sound to bounce
off, the effect is intensiﬁed. The cathedral
does have its advantages, however —
you can smoke and eat there, unlike
any of the libraries on campus. Also,

you can stay as late as you want. Just
make sure you don’t forgetyour glasses
and an extra lamp.

The William Pitt Union has two places
that are fairly quiet —— the blue room
and the red room. However, beware of
the furniture; it's so comfortable, you
won't be able to resist a nap. (Too bad
Telefact doesn’t run a wake-up—cal1
service. I for one have slept through
many a class on one of those red or
blue sofas.) Like so many campus
buildings, though, you are booted out
at midnight, unless you're lucky enough
to have an after-hours pass.

Of course, you can always go back to
your apartment or dorm to study.
Although I’ve never lived in a dorm
room, I heard they are neither roomy
nor quiet I do know that after I get
home at night, it takes me awhile to
recover from the ruckus caused by the
sports—complex crowd and frat-goers
whom I sat with on the campus bus.
Anyway, there are far too many
distractions at home — the television,
stereo, phone, food —— who can resist
breaking open a fresh C?) cellophane
pack of ramen noodles before hitting
the books? Of course, the biggest
distraction has got to be the sight of
your unmade bed with the ice—cold
pillow looking ever so inviting 

The only suggestions I can offer to
counteract this problem of students,
having nowhere to study are:

0 Study in the morning and ‘take night
classes.

-Circulate petitions stating that the
library, among other places, should be
open later and have quiet sections.

-Always keep your stereo and
television on, night and day. This way,
you’ll get sick of the noise and look
forward to studying. And after all that
drone all the time, even the library will
seem quiet.

has been saying for the past two
years, the S&L crisis was caused
by “deregulation” of the S&L
industry. We are told that there
was not enough government
involvement.

But in reality, the exact opposite
is true. The crises is a result of too
much government interference.

A decade ago, the federal
government increased the

per account. If the owner of an
S&L made bad investments and
lost all the money that was
deposited in it, then the
government would reimburse the
owner. This guarantee
encouraged S&L operators to take
risks that they otherwise never
would have taken. After all, even
if they lost all of their money,
they would eventually get it back
from the government.

Of course the money doesn’t
really come from the government.
Instead, it comes from the
taxpayers. You, I and everybody
else in this country will be paying
for this mess.

The news‘ media continuously
uses words such as “crooks” and

owners of various S&Ls. But this

description. By themselves, the

“stealing.” Instead, it calls it
“taxation.”

Our elected officials think that
spending money will solve the
S&L crisis. Of course, in reality
throwing money at this problem
will only make it worse. The
more money the S&L owners get
from the government, the more
risks they will take, and thus, the
more they will fail.

What the government should
do is simply stop insuring the
S&Is. If such a thing ever happens,
and if there really is a demand for
insurance, then private companies
would offer it. In such a situation,
things would be very different
than they are now. With private
insurance, if an S&L were making
risky investments, then its
insurance premiums would go
up. Meanwhile, taxpayers would
not have to pay for any S&L that
did happen to fail.

difference? Simple. The owners
of private insurance companies
would be reimbursing with their
own money any S&L that
happened to fail. Thus, they

wouldhave an incentive to charge ’

insurance premiums’ that
correspond to the amount of risk
that is involved. Such prices can
only be determined in a free
market in which people spend
their own money. But with the
present system of government
insurance, the politicians are not
spending their own money.
Instead, they are spending your
money and my money.

If I had to summarize the
savings and loan disaster in just

The 18th—ranked Pitt volleyball
team (52-5) won an NCAA
tournament match for the first
time in its history, with a four-
game victory over 15th-ranked
Ohio State in a first-round match
Friday night.

“It’s hard enough just getting
into the top 32, and now were
among the top 16,” said Coach
Sue Woodstra of the victory. “This
is a big jump for the program.”

The match lasted two hours
and three minutes. Pitt took the
first two games by scores of 15-12
and 15-13. Ohio State came back
to win the third game 15-9, but
the greatest comeback of the
match was to follow.

After Pitt took a 2-1 lead, Ohio
State ran out to a 15-5 lead in the
fourth game. The Lady Panthers
took over the game at that point,
scoring the next 12 points to win
the game and the match.

“This is something we’ve done
all year. We had the confidence,
and the team was determined to
win the match,” Woodstra said.
“It was a combination of that and
Ohio lState’sl coming apart. In
our first match of the year [against
Wisconsin] we came back, and

the Big 10 title this season.

Pitt had a .215 kill percentage
for the match, compared to a
very low .157 for Ohio State.

The match featured a lot of
back—and— forth play, as the Lady
Panthers had an extremely high
117 digs, and their opponents
had 127.

Junior outside hitter Susan
Zonneville led the team in kills,
with 20 to go along with 20 digs.

Freshman outside hitterAnn Marie
Lucanie was tops on the team in
digs, with 31 to go with 14 kills.
Pitt’s senior co-captains both had
strong games, as outside hitter
Michele Adamson had 19 kills,
and setter Jenelle Lantagne had
52 assists. Junior middle hitter
Dee MacAuley contributed with
21 digs.

“We played terribly when we
played Ohio State earlier this
year,” Woodstra said. “We were a
lot better this time.” Ohio State
swept Pitt in three games in a
Sept. 19 match at Ohio State.

Pitt will go to Nebraska this
Friday night for its second— round
match. The Cornhuskers are 30-
2 and ranked second in the nation.
They beat Miami (Ohio) to reach
the second round.

Pitt has lost all three of its
matches against top 10 teams this
season, losing to UCLA in the
Wisconsin Tournament at the
beginning of the season and
losing to Penn State twice.

“They are really huge,”
Woodstra said. “That’s pretty
much what we faced against UCLA
[which Pitt took to five games
before losing]. Nebraska is an
excellent team.” The Cornhusker
lineup includes one player who
is 6-foot-5, three who are 6-2 and
one who is 6-0. Their setter is 5-

“The team played there last
year, and I think that will help,”
Woodstra said. “They have a huge

averaged 2,700 fans this season
—-— tops in the NCAA. We’ll have
a lot of people screaming at us.”

If the Lady Panthers win Friday,
they will face the winner of the
Penn State-Wisconsin match. That
game will also be played Friday.

Sports Editor

If the Steelers could just petition
the NFL and convince
commissioner Paul Ta gliabue that
they should get six points for any
score by Gary Anderson instead
of the standard three allotted for
place—kickers, then the black and
gold would have been in excellent
shape yesterday.

Anderson was a perfect four
for four and accounted for all of
the Steelers’ scoring in a 16-12
loss to the Cincinnati Bengals.
Anderson’s 200th to 203rd career
field goals came on a day when
the ninth-largest crowd in Three
Rivers Stadium history (58,200)
witnessed an offensive
performance by the Steelers that
was far from perfect when it
needed to be ﬂawless in a critical
division contest to determine first
place in the AFC Central.

The Steelers were on the verge
of a tremendous victory late in
the fourth quarter when they were

remaining.

But after two incompletions,
Richard Bell and Louis Li pps went
in motion simultaneously and
drew a delay of game penalty
after QB Bubby Brister spotted
the error and tried to call his
second consecutive timeout, an
illegal action according to the

rule book. ~'

“We weren’t lined up in the
right formation. [Belll wasn’t
supposed to go in motion; he
was supposed to be up,” said
head coach Chuck Noll.

As a result, the Steelers set up
third and goal from the 12, and .
Brister overthrew tight end Eric
Green in the end zone on fourth,
down after misfiring to Lipps on
the previous play.

Noll thought Brister had
overthrown Green on that play,
as well as many other receivers
during the course of the game,
but Brister thought differently.

unpleasant memories of the first

complaining about Joe Walton's
complex offensive schemes.
But the story was different this
time. The offense just plain didn’t
execute.
“When we get to the goal line,
we can't get it in. We had some

2 good play calling today; it was

just too many mistakes,” said
Steeler running back Tim Worley.

“We did have a lot of breaks.

opportunities, you have to cash

center Dermonti Dawson.

Keith Willis picked up his first
career interception after Hardy
Nickerson tipped a Norman
Esaison pass right into his hands.
Willis’ 5—yard return set the
Steelers up first and 10 at the
Bengal 22. But all the offense
could muster was a 32-yard Gary

5 Anderson field goal after Brister

fired an incomplete to Lipps on
the third play of the drive.

On Cincinnati’s next

 

possession, Esaison hit a wide-
open Eddie Brown for a 50-yard
score, capping a six play, 94-yard
drive. Esaison had dug out from
deep in his own territory after
Stanford Jennings bobbled an
Anderson kickoff at the 6-yard
line. Esaison hit Tim McGee with
passes of 27 and 10 yards to set
up the bomb to Brown.

The Steelers countered with
Anderson’s 200th career ﬁeld goal,
a 36-yard effort to post the score
at 7-6.

In the second quarter, things
began to look up for the Steelers,
as Lorenzo Freeman recovered
an Esaison fumble at the Steeler
4-yard line, ending a Bengal drive
which began at the Cincinnati 19.
But what looked like a blessing
turned out to be a curse, as
Brister was sacked for a safety by
James Francis. Brister rolled to
his right and had plenty of room
in front of him but never elected
to cross his own goal line.

“I was trying to make something
happen. I was rolling, and all of
a sudden before I could get the
chance to throw it away, they

had me,” Brister said.

“You're coached, and you think
all the time that as soon as you
get in that jam, you throw it away.
But I was trying to wait for
somebody to get open, and then
all of a sudden I was down.”

Cincinnati then embarked on a
12-play, 63-yard TD drive. James
Brooks went in from 1 yard out to
give the Bengals a 16-6 edge and
their final score of the afternoon.
The drive was greatly aided by
Carnell Lake’s illegal hands to the
face penalty, which gave the
Bengals a free ﬁrst down after
Lake and Greg Lloyd dropped
Brooks for a 3-yard loss on a
critical third and 1 situation.

“That penalty was definitely a
factor because they scored points
off it,” said Lake. “I sure didn’t
agree with that call, and it wrecked
a key play, but that’s how it
goes.”

The Steelers squandered yet
another opportunity for six points
in the third quarter when Lloyd
ignited the crowd, as he picked
off an Esaison pass and returned
it to the Bengal 39. Brister was
almost intercepted twice from
the Bengal 12,and the Steelers
had to settle for another Anderson
field goal.

After Breech misfired on his
second ﬁeld—goal attempt, Brister
and Co. managed to drive to the
Bengal 31 yard line, but had to
settle for that ever-present
Anderson field goal. This time it
was a 48—yarder, the longest of
his career.

Men's swim team
takes third plac

By Jim Lakely

Staﬂ“ Writer

The Panthers played gracious host but third ﬁddle to Maryland
and meet champion North Carolina State in the ﬁfth annual Pitt
Swimming and Diving Invitational meet at Trees Pool last
weekend.

N.C. State’s Nick Paleocrassas stole the show by setting meet
and pool records in the 50-yard freestyle with a time of 20.31
seconds. His time also qualiﬁed him for the NCAA Championships
and was just one of the six races the Wolfpack won in 13 events.

The Panthers ﬁnished ahead of fourth-place Bowling Green
and ﬁfth-place St. Bonaventure but couldn’t keep up with the
two Atlantic Coast Conference teams. Despite the apparently
discouraging score of 1149.5 points for N.C. State, 651.5 for
Maryland and 620 for Pitt, head coach Chuck Knoles was very
pleased with his team’s performance.

“We are swimming against a higher caliber of teams but with
less proven talent returning,” he said, “so we have to discover
new talent.

“I was very impressed that we were able to stay with
Maryland,” he said. “I was encouraged tremendously with the
team’s cohesiveness and their performance under pressure. We
fight a constant battle between pressure and performance.”

One Panther who won that battle and also won a meet
championship was Kevin McLaughlin. He outreached N.C.
State’s Adam Fitzgerald to the wall in the 200 breaststroke with
a time of 2:05.06.

Freshman diver Sean Braud had his best meet of the season,
taking second place in the 3-meter competition. According to
Knoles, Braud has an outside shot at joining teammate John
Sharkey as an NCAA qualiﬁer.

Pitt freestyler Joe Kozlina achieved a victory of his own: a
personal best time of 45.70 in the 100 free. The 4 x 100 free relay
team of Eric Cornell, David Dodson, Kozlina and Matt Porter
came close to qualifying for the NCAAs, and according to
Knoles, Eric Mattson is just a breath away in the 400 individual
medley.

play in front of a mere 7,000 fans.

The ceiling dropped again on the Pens, as they
fell apart in the third period, allowing three goals,
including the game—winner by former Capital and
always Penguin-killer Larry Murphy.

As evidenced by their record, the Penguins are
playing bad hockey lacking in confidence. They
have now dropped six of their past seven games
and have been consistently breaking down at key
times.

The loss to Minnesota was the second straight
game the Pens have lost in the third period. The
Pens haven’t held a lead anywhere in the third
period since Nov. 14 at Winnipeg —— eight games
ago. The Penguins continue to play sloppy hockey
in their own end and are often giving up easy shots
in the slots and rebound goals. The blame isn’t
totally on the defense, though. Often forwards are
late getting back, in addition to making bad decisions
on defense while missing their assignments. Before
last night the option line (Cullen, Stevens, Recchi)
was a staggering minus-32 combined in its last five
games.

There is no need for panic — the

As for the Pens, who are just falling further and
further in the division, this is just one of the many
games that, if lost, will leave the team with a
plethora of must-win Patrick Division games later
in the season. A

The Penguins will be playing makeup games in
December (to even out the games played with the
rest of the league) and need to capitalize. It could?’
become quite difficult for this team to win if every
game is a must-win situation.

“They are not that much of
better team, ” he said. “If we would
have shaved and tapered, we
would not have been beat.
Shaving and tapering makes a
very significant difference.”

The focus for the Panthers’ first
semester is the 30-team Christmas
meet in Trees Pool on Dec. 21,
and Knoles promises that his team
will be ready.

“We were not completely.)
prepared [for the Invitational
meet], but in the next week and
a half, we will,” Knoles said. “The
proof of the pudding will be
shown. There will be no excuses.
I expect us to walk away with the
men’s championship.”
