SGB selects new Allocations Committee after controversy

Zachariah Blott & Lisa DiRenzo

The Pitt News

The SGB has selected a new
Allocations Committee, and board mem-
bers say it’s back to business as usual.

Two weeks ago, all 10 members of the
Allocations Committee resigned because
they felt Justin DalMolin, president- of
SGB, and Gerald Klayman, the allocations
chairman, were "misusing" their authority
to approve spending of allocations‘ money.

This past summer, when all 10 mem-
bers of the board were not at campus,

DalMolin and Klayman approved over
$11,000 in spending, compared to approx-
imately $2,000 per summer in recent
years.

Five SGB members and Klayman
selected 11 students over the weekend as
the new committee members. DalMolin,
David Eisenberg, Jen Mollusso, Brandi
Miller and Marquette Bowman were the
SGB members who helped select the com-
rnittee.

The new Allocations Committee
members are Lewis Chazan, Jocelyn
Cortese, Anne Meredith DePree, Kirk

 

Edleman, Scott Egyed, Alfred Gaspari,
Sarah Groff, Dan Horowitz, Mark
Murphy, Nathan Porter and Monica
Stubanas.

"We chose them according to their
understanding of the allocations process,"
said Mollusso, "and their involvement in
campus activities."

She went on to explain that the new
committee is a diverse group, involved in
several different organizations, and ranges
from freshmen to seniors.

The new members will meet this
Sunday at 5 p.m. for the first time as a

committee, according to Klayman.

New committee member Horowitz
applied for the position after he saw that
the allocations members had resigned. He
said that he believes "the previous com-
mittee allocated the money the best way
they could but  part of their frustration
was what transpired over the summer."

"I recognize that my role is to recom-
mend how the money is spent," he added.
"But the power rests ultimately with the
president and the rest of the board. I'll have

Imagine moving into a 14-foot-long by
l0-foot—wide room, with someone you don’t
even know, along with everything you both
own and being expected to stick it out for a
year.

Well that’s what thousands of freshmen
did one month ago, and since then, most of
them are getting along just ﬁne. Even if it
means just keeping to themselves while
they’re both in the room.

"We get along - don‘t hang out with each

other, don't like ﬂie same music, but yeah,
we're getting along," said Kyle about his
roommate. The freshman asked that his last
name not be used.

Maria Markunis hasn’t encountered any
problems with her roommate, either, except
one minor thing.

"My roommate and I get along, but she
goes to bed too early," said Markunis.
Another freshman, who wished to remain
anonymous, said that she and her roommate
aren’t ﬁghting, but they aren’t best friends
either.

she said. "We don't like the same things, but
we are civil to each other."

Matthew Rossman, a resident assistant
in Sutherland Hall, hasn’t noticed any dis-
cord on his ﬂoor. He ﬁnds this impressive
considering that six-person suites were
turned into eight- and nine-person suites to
accommodate the increased number of
freshmen compared to last year.

"This is pretty amazing considering the
ciarrirning in here. Not all of them are best of
friends, but they get along all right,” he said.
“Like, there were two roommates — it was
obvious they didn't get along —— but they
realized that they had to at least tolerate each
other to make things comfortable."

Many freshman roommates know each
other from high school, which helped ease
the transition from high school life to college
life, according to Jean Koesel, who works at
the University's counseling services.

. Rossman agrwd. "Most of the fresh-
man students on my ﬂoor knew each other
and  it deﬁnitely helped ease things."

Tim Schaible, a freshrrian, knew his
roommate ﬁorn, high school, and so far

everything’s worked out.

"We've known each other for four
years,” said Schaible. “We go out after
studying and out on weekends."

Not every pair of freshmen who were
placed together have enjoyed their ﬁrst
month in me residence halls, though.

Since the semester began, there have
been 27 requests to the Office of Residence
Life by freshmen to change roorris.

According to the ORL's Diane Casile,
the requests were sparked by personality
conﬂicts. Of the 27 changes, 20 were made
by female roommates.

Koesel said, however, that a generaliza-
tion could not be made because women have
tended to address roommate problems and
to use counseling services more than do
male students.

According to Koesel, most freshmen
who use the University's counseling services
during the ﬁrst few weeks of the semester
suffer from homesickness.

"lt's a big transition, leaving home and
coming to college,” she said. “There are a
few adjustment problems which they have
to address." The ORL will process room-
change requests through the end of
November.

International Week kicks off
soccer tourney at the Cathedral

Lisa Grzyboski

Senlor Staff Wrlter

Using athletics to promote cultural
diversity, organizers of this year’s
International Week decided to include a soc-
cer tournament on the list of events.

The four—day affair held on the
Cathedral lawn ﬁorn Tuesday to the cham-

' pionship game on Friday transformed the

grassy lawns into competitive battleﬁelds
where grunting players exerted themselves
to the limit.

A handful of teams ranging from the
Katz graduate business school to the gradu-
ate computer science program to the
Engineering Graduate Student Association
showed up to play some soccer and to dis-
play school and departmental pride.

Many players were happy to be active
and change their everyday pattern. Some
even skipped class to come out and partici-
pate.
“It is a very good idea, and it’s a good
chance to have some frm,” said Juan Polar,
a Katz business school graduate student
from Peru. “Many people can play soccer.
It’s really popular all over the place.”

Playing on a team composed of V

German, Mexican and Bolivian students,
Polar was getting the full elfect of the wide
array of culture present on Pitt’s campus.

This is exactly what Elaine Linn was
searching for when she was organizing the
event.

“It was my baby,” said the program
manager for Pitt’s International
Development Center. -“It was meant to act
as a venue to bring domestic and interna-
tional students together.”

With the Dynamo Soccer League help-
ing to sponsor the event and the Pitt men’s
soccer team providing some of the equip-
ment, Linn sprinted ﬁom one makeshift
ﬁeld to the next while supervising the event.

“My boys play sports, and I just
thought this would be a perfect means for
people to get together that normally would-
n’t interact,” she said. “What we are trying
to do is celebrate the international ﬂavor of
Pitt.”

Ivar Handeland, a Norwegian
exchange student in the graduate informa-
tion science departrnent, was taking full
advantage of the opportunity as he prepared
togoagainstthegraduatemathtearn.

Bouncing the soccer ball ﬁorn one
knee to the other, he smiled.

‘This is very good. We had no problem
ﬁnding people to play,” he said. “When I
was here practicing on Friday, there were a
lot of different people from different coun-
tries. There were just so many international
students.”

countries of Latin America. This region has
one of the real natural markets for the U.S."

Citing Latin America's decades-long
policy of creating trade barriers to protect its
national industries, DeWalt cautioned the
United States to not follow the same pattern.

"The greater the economic integration,
the better otf we will be, and with econom-
rc integration will come political ir1tegra-
tion," he said. "Soon nations will be less
likely to engage in conﬂict."

But even with the positives of pursuing
global trade, DeWalt understands the con-
cerns many workers have.

"I really understand the wonies of
workers because free trade really does
directly threaten the jobs of certain sectors,"
he said, "but at the same time it opens up the
creation of jobs in the economy."

"While I understand the concern for
their own jobs, we won't be able to slow
down the process of economic integration
in the world," DeWalt said. "It is happen-

Two teens held
for the shooting
death of two cops

Across the Nation

ARLINGTON, Va. —— The prosecution is
calling more witnesses today in the sex-
abuse trial of Marv Albert.

At least a half dozen more witnesses are
expected to take the stand. They include two
people who will discuss the genetic tests that
link Albert to bite marks found on his
accuser.

The woman spent much of the day on
the stand Tuesday. She tried to portray
Albert as a lover who turned violent when
she refused to bring a third person into their
bedroom.

The defense tried to destroy her credi-
bility. They played a tape of the woman
apparently urging a taxi driver to provide
damaging evidence against Albert in
exchange for a new car and $50,000. Later
the woman insisted that she was just joking.
She said she doesn’t have that kind of
money.

FAYETTEVILLE, N.C. — Two law oili-
cers were shot and killed on Tuesday during
a North Carolina traﬂic stop, and two
teenage suspects are in custody.

State Trooper Lloyd Lowry and
Sheriff ’s Deputy David Hathcock were
gunned down with a military-style assault
riﬂe. The police say the trooper stopped
what appeared to be a stolen car. The sher-
iff’s deputy was responding to his call for
assistance.

The suspects were described as 17- and
19-year-old brothers Kevin and Tilrnon
Golphin. Both were arrested a short time
later when they wrecked the car near a truck
stop.

The two men are suspected of holding
up a South Carolina ﬁnance company and
ﬂeeing in an employee’s car earlier Tuesday.

Around the World

MIGRINO, Mexico —— Continuing to lose
steam but still a threat, Hurricane “Nora” is
expected to head ashore today in Mexico.

The storm is zeroing in on the central
part of the Baja California Peninsula after
battering tourist towns on the peninsula‘s
southern tip.

The storm is still well otf the coast, and
its top winds have died down to about 85
mph. The storm should weaken further as it
crosses Baja, Calif, but forecasters at the
U.S. Hurricane Center say it’s going to bring
a lot of rain to the southwestern states later
this week.

Resort communities along the southern
tip of Baja are using earthmovers to plow
away rivers of mud, but one California

Bob Kerry: a good choice for Nov. 2000

Michael Berquist

 

Clinton talked a lot but
didn't say very much

Well, this probably isn’t going to sound new to
anybody, but it should be said nonetheless:

Clinton says absolutely nothing when he talks in
public!

Perhaps that makes him a good politician. After
all, one cannot be caught in foolish statements when
one never makes a statement to begin with. Most good
politicians and administrators are like that (ahern, Pitt
administrators), in that they dodge the questions and
dodge the issues, and you leave not knowing anything
more than you did in the beginning.

So why does he bother making an appearance?

It’s a photo-op.

" Ifhe’s not going to enlighten us, the least our pres-
ident can do is not spend our tax dollars ﬂying Air
Force One to Pittsburgh, making our city tighten secu-
rity to protect him and wasting the precious time of so
many people who came to listen to him speak.

1 Clinton doesn’t seem like a bad president, but he
wastes our time with these stupid appearances. Al
Gore we can understand: He’s probably going to run
for president in a couple years, so a photo-op may
beneﬁt him. But Clinton has already been elected to
the Oval Ofﬁce for his ﬁnal stint. He should spend our
time more productively, doing more good for our
country instead of riding on his own coattails, telling
us about all the good he’s already done. That’s not
new information, and if he’s not going to give us any,
he shouldn’t waste our time making token appear-
ances.

You may notice that we say he is wasting “our
time.” That’s because his time is our time. He’s on our
dime 24 hours a day. That’s what he asked for when
he ran for president. That’s what he earned.

A photo-op doesn’t help our community. It does-
n’t “grow” our economy. It doesn’t educate our chil-
dren.

Clinton could do a lot of good for this country.
Hopefully, he will do more good instead of just

reminding us why we gave him another four years to

try. 

columnist

With President Clinton in the
process of wrapping up his ﬁfth year
as president, the question is, “Who
will succeed him in the Oval Ofﬁce
after his term expires in 2001?” On
both sides of the aisle, the usual sus-
pects all stand ready to take the
plunge: Pat Buchanan, Steve Forbes,
Jack Kemp, Dan Quayle, George W.
Bush, Phil Gramrn, Al Gore and
Dick Gephardt are just a few of the
people who are expected to run that
year.

While much of the talk about
who might be sitting in the White
House in three years has swirled
around these eight men, little men-
tion has been made of a man who I
think would make a great president:
Senator Robert Kerrey of Nebraska.

For those not entirely familiar
with Senator Kerrey and his career,
let me tell you a little about him. Bob
Kerrey was bom in Lincoln, Neb., in
1943. He attended the University of
Nebraska as a pharmacy student,
and graduated in 1966.

Kerrey promptly enlisted in the
military and went to Vietnam as a
Navy SEAL —— one of our armed

I forces’ elite warriors. In that oonﬂict,

he lost his rightleg up to his knee
when a grenade exploded at his feet.
Despite this wound, he continued to

able to escape from danger. For his
courageous actions he was awarded
the Medal of Honor, the highest
award our nation can give to those
who serve in the U.S. 
Returning to Nebraska, Kerrey
started a chain of restaurants and
health clubs, becoming a successful
entrepreneur. In 1982, he ran for the
govemorship of Nebraska and won.

In just one term he successfully
made several difﬁcult cuts to the
state budget and then retired, despite
poll—approval ratings in the ‘70s.

After his retirement, a Senate
seat opened up in Nebraska, and
Kerrey ran for it, winning easily
despite the fact that Republican
George Bush swept the state on elec-
tion day. Senator Kerrey became just
the fourth Medal of Honor winner to
serve in the Senate.

After a few years in the Senate,
Kerrey ran for president in 1992. He
announced his candidacy in a vision-
ary speech, saying he wanted to
“lead America’s fearless, restless
voyage of generational progress.”
Unfortunately, his campaign was
crippled by a lack of funds and his
inability to break out from behind
Bill Clinton and Paul Tsongas,
whom the media anointed the front-
runners that year following the New
Hampshire primary.

Kerrey’s campaign perished,
but he learned many valuable
lessons.

Dejected, Senator Kerrey
retumed to the Senate and ran for re-
election two years later. Despite
Nebraska’s staunch Republican
nature (Bill Clinton has won just 30
percent and 35 percent of the vote in
1992 and 1996, respectively),
Kerrey easily withstood the
Republican tide in 1994.

Kerrey is now in his eighth year
as a U.S. senator and is an important
leader in Washington D.C. He is cur-
rently the ranking Democrat on the
Senate Select Intelligence
Committee, and a member of the
Finance Committee (the committee
that writes the tax code, regulates
trade and oversees health-care mat-
ters). He has also courageously
taken the lead on the politically sen-

THE PITT NEWS

sitive subject of entitlement reform.

In 1994, Kerrey and GOP
Senator John Danforth teamed up to
lead a bipartisan commission on
entitlement reform. By together
proposing innovative ideas like hav-
ing the government cut the employ-
ee’s share of the Social Security pay-
roll tax (thus eliminating a burden on
America’s middle class) and advo-
cating other tough decisions, these
two senators showed that there was a
possibility of finally resolving this
difficult issue, and that our entitle-
ment programs can be saved before
they go bankrupt in the 21st century.

It’s a shame that Speaker
Gingrich and his followers chose to
ignore Senator Kerrey’s proposals in
favor of an attempt to simply gut a
system that needs an overhaul.
When Senator Kerrey becomes
president, I hope he can ensure that
his reform proposals will ﬁnally be
enacted.

Even though the next presiden-
tial election is over three years away,
now is the time to begin considering
the direction that we as a people
want to take America as we cross
President Clinton’s bridge to the 21st
century.

Senator Kerrey would make a
terriﬁc president to lead America in
our journey beyond the year 2000.
He is a bold visionary, highly intelli-
gent, courageous, and very indepen-
dent-minded. It is impossible not to
admire Senator Kerrey when you
know what he has done. He has led
a life that most men can only dream
of, and I have a feeling that the best
is yet to come for him. He would
make a great president.

Michael Berquist thinks that Senator
Kerrey would make a great presi-
dent of the United States 0fAmerica.

 

 

Thursday, 25 September 1997

The Pitt News solicited the opinions of
student organization leaders and members
on the allegations of a misuse of power by
SGB. As we promised those who would
write, responses were edited only for
length and newspaper style. All four
responses we received follow.

Daniel Cooper
President
Pi Kappa Phil IFC

As the former president of the Pi Kappa
Phi Fraternity and a former member of the
IFC executive board, I support the position
of the Allocations Board 100 percent!

The student activities fee is something
all Pitt students are required to pay, regard-
less if they are involved in a student group or
not. That money is very important to the
groups. The IFC is a governance group, and
last year I attended our national conference.
It would of been nice to have aTown Car to
drive around in. I think that that the SGB
president and the allocations chairmen need
to re-evaluate their motives for being in
oﬂice.

There should be a
summer committee

I was a member of the Allocations
Committee in 1987, and I can truly
understand the feelings of the commit-
tee. The Allocations Committee is one of
the most inﬂuential committees for the
students, as they are ﬁnancially responsi-
ble for the economic well—being of the
student body. It is vital that a check and
balance system remain in place to avoid
abuses by any one individual or organi-
zation. It only seems reasonable to me
that during the summer months when the
remaining committee members are not
available that at least two responsible
individuals be available for reviews of
requests. Where was the Allocations
Committee advisor? Was the advisor
aware of this apparent abuse of power?

I agree that something should be
done about the recent failure in commu-
nication and lack of checks and balances.
Perhaps this can be best accomplished
by sitting down with all members
involved and coming to a peaceful reso-
lution, one which will prevent this type
of thing from happening in the future.

Former Allocations Committee Member

SGB must be held
accountable

Although the SGB has had many
hard—working people counted in its
membership through the years, it has
also been tainted by a few “scholars”
who seem to forget the "purpose behind
their service time and time again. It

THE PITT NEWS

Student Leaders Respond

Fred Sinkevich
President and Founder
Native American Student Organization

I am in full support of the Student '

Government Board. I think they are a very
hard—working group of people. Last year
when I started NASO, they bent over
backwards to give me any help I needed. I
think that they should be given credit
where credit is long due. All I’ve seen is
SGB did this  SGB did that — nothing
positive that they are doing to help the
University. All that’s being focused is neg-
ative. How about showing the positive for
a change?

Paul McKrell
President
University Democrats

When I was 10, I got caught with my
hand in the cookie jar. I still remember:

couple of SGB members in this term as
well. This is very unfortunate. However,
I place most of the blame with the
University administration that seems to
react to such abuses with a disapproving
nod and a “tsk, tsk.”

The SGB was elected in a fair elec-
tion, and if the ethics or priorities of
some dictate that they spend this kind of
money during the summer, then they
have to live with that. Having traveled
on business for my company, I have not
splurged on meals, and if I did, my boss
would haul me into the ofﬁce pronto.
Why don’t these rules apply to the SGB?
Are they the second branch of the House
of Windsor? Since SGB members gener-
ally don’t run for re-election, why should
they care what you think?

You probably spend your time
drinking beer on Atwood Street instead
of doing the “important” business of run-
ning the SGB, criss—crossing the state in
search of justice and a good steak. The
task now at hand is to close loopholes
that allow such extravagance to occur.
This rule of one man/woman running the
show in the summer is outrageous. That
is one—third of the year! I would think
that it would be possible for the board to
meet at least once in the summer (if they
can’t, than they shouldn’t be on the
board).

Joe Cavalla sounds like an SGB
apologist when he calls the allocations
process “solid.” I’d like to see how long
he would last in private industry for not

ti

Double-Stuff Oreos. Sure, I tried to explain
that the Oreos were “not a luxury,” and that
I had the “authority” to take more than my
fair share. But I knew I was wrong.

So the family got together and made
sure that I would no longer be tempted:
They put the jar out of my reach.

It’s time Pitt got together and removes
temptation; Take the allocations cookie jar
away from SGB. It’s time all student orga-
nizations got their fair share. We’re tired of
begging for crumbs while watching the
SGB Cookie Monster devour all the
Oreos.

Harry Mudd
Vice President

BAS

I am writing you in response to the
article concerning student-govemment
allocations. I am upset that you guys will
not produce any valid information in your

changes must be made. His comment
that there may have been “some errors in
judgement” is a gross understatement.
The student body, if it is serious, needs to
make its elected leaders accountable.

Perhaps future SGB candidates
should sign a pledge at halftime of a
Panther game that they will adhere to
certain ﬁscal limits.

While they are at it, why not have a
recall election for Mr. DalMolin? A
mayor in the town next door was forced
to resign for much less. After all, Jerry
Garcia will probably play Star Lake
again before Joe Cavalla and Joyce
Giangarlo do anything to make their jobs
more difﬁcult. Why should they? Their
comments in the Marc Nuzzo article on
Sept. 22 make that blatantly apparent. I
hardly think that things were blown “out
of proportion” as Giangarlo claimed.
Their attitude is very condescending to
students and alumni alike. In my experi-
ence, Pitt “investigations” are merely
charades to pacify the outraged.

Perhaps the Pennsylvania auditor
general should take a gander at the SGB
ﬁnances since its fee is mandated to all
students. The ball is now in the court of
the common student who does not often
get involved in SGB functions. Make
your complaints known in no uncertain
terms and demand reforms. Your silence
would imply an acceptance of these
practices, and you will have only your-

selves to blame for the inevitable results.

article. The information you gave was
completely incorrect and was presented
only to produce controversy between stu-
dent government, allocations and student
organizations here at Pitt. This is the reason
why no one here participates in anything
worthwhile here at Pitt, because you print
poor articles. Why aren’t we talking about
why Pitt spent several thousand dollars on
placing a railing outside of the Cathedral?
Or why is Pitt spending lots of money on
repaving the sidewalk in front of the Union
instead of building a new dorm for its stu-
dents? By the way, student government is
really trying to address the needs of its stu-
dents at conferences in Philadelphia to get
us more money for Pell grants, Stafford,
and PHEAA grants. Why don’t you put
that in the paper, huh? What are you
accomplishing by putting students against
one another; more arguments, less action,
more apathy. That’s what The Pitt News
wants, right? Pitt really sucks and The Pitt
News wants to keep it that way.

Thank you, and I will never see this
article in the paper because you guys are

hypocrites.

SGB is doing this all
for whose good?

Let me get this straight:

I) I, along with everyone else on this
campus, paid for the vacations of the
SGB members.

2) This was for our own good,
because the SGB cares deeply for us, as
evidenced by the eloquent declaration of
Christa Douaihy:

3) “Screw them all.”

I would like, on behalf of all CAS
students, to thank the SGB for its con-
cern. SGB members are much less likely
to cause bodily harm to their victims than
a Liberty Avenue mugger, but they nev-
ertheless provide the sarne service. Also,
kudos to President Justin DalMolin for
supporting American industry by renting
a Lincoln Town Car rather than, say, a
Honda Civic; his support of the ever-
struggling air travel industry is also duly
noted and appreciated. And what native
Pittsburgher doesn’t want to help down-
town return to its former glory? There,
too, board members came to the rescue
by pumping desperately needed funds
into the restaurants of this ﬁne city.

I feel we all can — nay, must! -
learn from the SGB’s example. At a time
when there’s only one rental car available
in all of Philadelphia, it is clear that the
tourism industry grasps onto the edge of
a rocky precipice and that we the students
must grasp out with a ﬁrm hand to aid our
fellow Americans. In the words of John
F. Kennedy, “With a clear conscience our
only sure reward, with history the ﬁnal
judge of our deeds, let us begin anew ....”

Thank you, board members, for
showing us the true meaning of public
service.

Marvelous
Marv and his
media circus

Marv Aufrichtig began broadcasting
sporting events when he was in the third
grade.

Ambrose and Zachary were the two
rodents vying for medals in the inaugural
Hamster Olympics — the ﬁrst of a long line
of events that has included NBA and NFL
action.

Some 45—odd years after the hamsters,
Marv, who has since changed his name to
Marv Albert, is standing trial on forcible
sodomy and assault charges.

Coincidence? I think not.

If Mr. and Mrs. Aufrichtig had been
any sort of decent parents, they would have
had their son checked out a long, long time
ago. Instead, the world is checking him out
as he stands trial.

For 30-plus years, Albert has estab-
lished himself as one of the best broadcast-
ers in the business. He has worked with the
New York Rangers, the NBA and the real
Olympics since he broke into the ﬁeld in
1962.

Now he must deal with the public
scrutiny and embanassment that goes along
well with accounts of kinky sex and bite
marks in the daily news.

Ever since that romantic Feb. 12
evening in which Albert’s accuser claims
the 53-year-old broadcaster bit her repeat-
edly and forced her to perform oral sex,
Albert’s life has been in disarray.

He did continue to work the NBA play-
offs throughout the indictment process
because NBC said that he was innocent
until proved guilty.

Didn’t OJ. Simpson used to work for
NBC, too?

Anyway, this 42-year-old Vienna, Va.,
woman —— who Albert has had sexual rela-
tions with for nearly 10 years — has taken
the stand, and quicker than Marv can ﬂing
off his panties, she has destroyed any credi-
bility she may have had.

This is the same woman who faced
assault charges last year after she threatened
to kill her ex—boyﬁiend, his dog and any
other woman he may be with.

This woman has spent time in a mental
hospital, which isn’t a laughing matter. Still,
she can’t be viewed as the most stable of
people.

Keep in mind that Marv Albert’s name,
phone number and address were all found
in the black book of a dominatrix murdered
last year in New York City.

Hello, is this thing for real?

I honestly think that this whole thing is

Senior Staff Wrlter

Not much was expected of the Pitt
football team this year. Coming olf 2-9 and
4-7 seasons and initiating a new coaching
staff, a .500 record would be viewed by
most people as a successful season for the
Panthers.

Phil Clarke isn’t most people.

“I won’t settle for mediocrity,” the
junior inside linebacker said. “We’re not
trying to just come close.”

Pitt was able to come more than close
last Thursday night when it defeated the
Miami Hurricanes for the ﬁrst time since
1976. The win sparked a wild post-game
celebration with thousands of Pitt fans
storming the ﬁeld, eventually ripping
down the north end goal post in jubilation.

Clarke said that just as the post came
down, he could also feel the monkey com-
ing off Pitt’s back.

“It was almost unbelievable,” Clarke
said of the post-garne celebration. “We
worked really hard this summer, and it
paid olf. We knew if we executed, we
could beat themf’

The win was further evidence of Pitt’s
revamped defense. Although Pitt surren-
dered 265 yards passing against the
Hurricanes, the Panther defense yielded
just 17 points, seven of which came on a
fake ﬁeld goal.

as Pitt’s run-stopper

Clarke, seen here standing over Penn State's Joe Jurevicius, had 7.5
tackles against the Miami Hurricanes last Thursday.

“We knew if we mixed it up defen-
sively that we could confuse [Miami quar-
terback Ryan] Clement,” Clarke said.

The Panthers’ eight-man front was
also able to contain Miarni’s explosive

rrmning backs, Trent Jones and Edgerrin
James, holding the duo to under 150 yards
rushing. With the exception of the
Houston game in which they allowed 271

West Virginia Mountaineers
(2-1) at Miami Hurricanes
(1-2)

Miami is looking to
bounce back after two losses in
six days, thanks in part to our
beloved Panthers. Miami used
to be one of college football’s
toughest home teams, but it
has lost four games in the
Orange bowl over the last two
seasons.

West Virginia, on the other

E hand, is looking to avenge last

season’s 10-7 loss at the hands
of the Hurricanes. Last year,
WVU controlled the game, but
Miami blocked a punt and
returned it for a touchdown
with only 26 seconds remain-
ing in the contest to take a last-
second thriller.

WVU will rely on sopho-

more running back Amos
Zeroue, who averages 186
yards per game, to carry the
Mountaineer offense, while
Miami will look to Ryan
Clement to shred the WVU
secondary.

This is the biggest and
most important game in the
Big East this weekend; after
it’s over, one of these perennial
Big East powerhouse teams
will be 0-2 in conference play.

Maryland (0-3) at Temple(l-
3)

This game features two
teams trying to win some
respect and hopefully, in the
process, a game. Maryland is
coming off an embarrassing
40-14 defeat at home to the
hands of the North Carolina
Tarheels and has shown no
signs of being a good football

team. Temple, however,

defeated Boston College and
gave the Big East’s best team,
Virginia Tech, a scare last
week.

For Temple to win, they
need their star rusher, Stacey
Mack, to pound out yardage.
He has posted two 100-yard
games this season

Maryland, is in much
worse rushing shape than
Temple. Against the Tarheels
last week, it only rushed for 48
yards as a team. It needs its
workhorse, Brian Underwood,
to step up if the Terps are to
win.

Cincinnati (2-1) at Boston
College (2-1)

Surprisingly, this game
could be one of the best involv-
ing a Big East team this week
Cincirmati has beaten two solid
squads in Tulsa and Kansas

and could possibly beat Boston

College in its own backyard.
The Bearcats are anchored
by a tough defense that pum-
meled Kansas’ rushing attack
last week, holding them to 23
carries for rninus-61 yards.
They also sacked the
Jayhawks’ quarterbacks six
times. Quarterback Chad
Plummer threw for one touch-
down and ran for another
against Kansas last week and
could give the inconsistent BC
defense a test this week.
Meanwhile, Boston
College has surprised some
teams in the Big East them-
selves. They lost to Temple in
week one but rebounded to
beat West Virginia and
Rutgers. What’s the reason for
the turnaround? Mike Cloud.
Last week, Cloud replaced
last season’s only Big East
1,000-yard rusher, Omari

Ifeel kind of like
Notre Dame. Every
week I seem to get
worse at these picks.
When that happens
to any respectable
football team, it
schedules some team

like Western Wyoming Tech to come  

pad the record. Fortunately, most of this
week’s games involve teams like Western
Wyoming Tech. For example, there’s 

Central Florida (+16 1/2) at Auburn

One of my delusions last week was the
belief that Auburn could somehow lose.
Auburn probably isn’t in the same class as
Florida, but at the same time, I ﬁnd it hard
to believe that there are seven teams better
than the eighth-ranked Tigers. They have a
solid defense, a Heisman Trophy candidate
in Dameyrme Craig at quarterback, and
they showed last week at LSU that they can
win a big game. This isn’t a big game, but
Auburn will still win. I only mention it
because it was this close to being the best
bet this week.
Auburn 45, Central Florida 6

West Virginia (+9) at Miami

Who’d have believed that these two
traditional powerhouses would come into
this game as the sixth- and seventh-place
teams in the eight—team Big East? Show me
someone who says he predicted that, and
I’ll show you a liar. I tend to like Miami
here because their two losses are to decent
teams, Arizona State and Pitt. On the other
hand, West Virginia lost to Boston College.
Miami 31, West Virginia 17

Florida at Kentucky (+22)

This looks like the most interesting
game of the week. Florida Coach Steve
Spurrier, who gives out compliments like
Mr. Scrooge gives out Christmas bonuses,
had some pretty nice things to say about
Kentucky quarterback Tim Couch:

“He’s a big—time prospect. He throws a
nice, catchable pass,” Spunier said.

Couch’s offense is on pace to shatter
every school record in the books. In fact,
through just three games, 13 records have
already fallen.

This game has the potential to be a real
shootout. Kentucky’s defense won’t stop
Florida’s otfense. The question is whether
Florida’s defense can stop Kentucky. For
the sake of entertaining football, I hope not.
Florida 51, Kentucky 38

Virginia (+14) at North Carolina
Almost every team in the ACC has
some kind of upset win this season. A lot
has been made of the rise of the ACC, and
for good reason. ACC teams are beating up
on other conferences. It’ll be interesting to
see two conference teams play against each

North Carolina 34, Virginia 10

Notre Dame (+14) at Michigan

Last year, Notre Dame had a very com-
mendable 8-3 record, but when the Bowl
Alliance didn’t invite the Irish to its New
Year’s Day party, Notre Dame went home
and sulked instead of playing in something

like the Cotton Bowl -— a perfectly .

respectable bowl game. It’s not like it was
going to the Alamo Bowl. Unless tl1ere’s
been a serious attitude adjustment at South
Bend, this season is already over for Notre
Dame. “The Eliminator” would have a bet-
ter chance of beating Hogan than Notre
Dame has of playing in an alliance bowl. I
think the Irish players know that. Why else
would they have played so lousy last week?
Michigan 31, Notre Dame 10

Southern Mississippi (+6 1/2) at
Alabama

The Golden Eagles of Southern
Mississippi are rather uninteresting, except
for the fact that they currently occupy the
spot right in front of Pitt in the AP poll.
Alabama, on the other hand, is an estab-
lished national power. It happened to have
a bad game last week, but with so many
other big games going on, not many people
noticed.

The loser of this game drops out of the
top 25, and more importantly, out of the
conference championship picture. Alabama
won’t let that happen.

Alabama 24, Southern Mississippi 14

This week’s Best Bet:
Clemson at Georgia Tech (even)

Clemson actually started out the week
as a 1-point underdog. This is the seventh-
ranked team in the country we’re talking
about here. Its opponent is the one team that
lost to Notre Dame. I hate to make the same
team my best bet for two consecutive
weeks, but how can you pass this up? As
long as the odds makers want to continue
giving the Tigers absolutely no respect, I’ll
have to continue picking them.

just one big joke. When you think
that it can’t get any stranger, it
comes back to bite you in the back
end.

Enter Walter “Biggie” Brody.

Biggie is the cab driver who,
when propositioned by the
Virginia woman to scrape up
some dirt on Albert, asked for
$50,000 and a new car in
exchange for infonnation.

She said, “OK, OK, baby.”

Albe1t’s attorney Roy Black
asked the woman Tuesday in the
Arlington courtroom if she had
ever offered anyone a bribe in
exchange for some sort of evi-
dence that would be useful in ﬁnd-
ing Albert guilty.

She said no.

Black countered with the tape
recording of the conversation
between her and Biggie.

That was all just a joke, she
commented. In fact, Brody was
like the father she never had.

Black continued to chip away
at the woman’s credibility, asking
her why she didn’t scream for
help, why she didn’t call hotel
security, and why she gave Albert
a passionate hug and kiss at the
end of the evening.

She insists that her actions
were a result of her being in shock.

WALK-ON OFFENSIVE AND
DEFENSIVE LINEMEN.

We will accommodate your schedule.

The accuser described how
her relationship with Albert went
from romantic for nearly a decade,
to “sour” on that February night.

Milk goes sour.

Lemons are sour.

Getting bitten on the back and
being forced to perform oral sex
on a guy like Marv Albert seems
like it would be a little worse than
“sour.”

The jury will decide the fate
of Mr. Albert, but until then,
America will sit back and watch
unfold the kinky details of a once-
respected professional and a for-
mer switchboard operator from

I can’t help but look past all of
the less-than—romantic accounts of
Albe1t’s feast and see a real love
story here. The crazy girl far out of
touch with reality falls in lust with
the quiet, preppy, closet-pom-
ﬁend who has a sweet tooth for
sports  and other stuff.

Every couple has problems.

dental records, pornographic
movies and a bald cross-dressing
man with a deep, guttural voice.

Yeah, like that never hap-
pened to you.

Arkansas State (1-2) at Virginia
Tech (3-0)

Of course, for every good
game there has to be a mismatch.
Virginia Tech enters this contest
with a high national ranking and a

3-0 record in the Big East
Conference.

Arkansas State comes in with
a less-than-stellar record. They
don’t have a conference, but the
independent Indians did manage
a win over archnemesis Central
Arkansas earlier this season.

When the Indians did face a
nationally ranked opponent —
their ﬁrst game versus Georgia
Tech — they were on the receiv-
ing end of a 34-7 beating.

If ASU has one thing going

for them, it’s the poor health of
many of the Hokie starters.
Linebackers Cory Bird and
Korey Iiby have missed practices
this week due to injury, as have
comerbacks Ike Charlton and
Anthony Midget. Two offensive
linemen and a reserve tight end
are also on the walking wounded
list for Virginia Tech, but Head

players will miss Saturday’s con-

three games.

Clarke has been the focus of
the Panthers’ run defense, leading
the team with 38 tackles. Coach
Walt Harris’ emphasis on stop-
ping the run has allowed Clarke,
who is a ferocious run-stopper, to
step into the limelight.

“I love to play the run,”
Clarke said. “I want opposing
coaches to say, ‘Run away from
Phil Clarke.’ I want to be the ﬁrst
person to be there, and I want to
nail the runners.”

Combined with outside line-
backer Ernest Coakley, who is
second on the team with 34.5

tackles, the Panthers are indeed
making it diﬁicult for opposing
teams to run the ball.

“We’re a team, and We play
well as a team,” Clarke said of
himself and Coakley. “He’s like
my shadow.”

Clarke said that coming olf
the Houston game, in which he
had a career-high 14 tackles,
Miami tried to double-team him.
That left single coverage on
Coakley, who finished with 7.5
tackles against the Hurricanes.

Yet, despite all the positives
gained from last week’s game, the
Panthers must watch for a let-
down after the emotional Miami
win. Pitt has an oif week this
week before traveling to perenni-
al doormat Temple next weekend.

But just because it’s an off
week doesn’t mean that it’s time

to relax for the resurgent Panthers.

‘‘In no way are we going to
overlook Temple,” Clarke said of
the Owls. “We’re not going to
give them a chance [to win].
Right now, we’re playing 11 as
one. It’s hard to beat a team that
won’t be beat.”

Making big plays has been
Clarke’s forte this season. In addi-
tion to leading the team in tackles,
Clarke also has seven tackles for
losses, two sacks and even a fum-
ble recovery in the Houston end
zone that gave Pitt the go-ahead
touchdown.

Clarke is not a vocal leader
on the ﬁeld. But if he sees some-
thing that needs improvement,
he’s not afraid to make his voice
heard.

“I’m a linebacker that won’t
settle for mediocrity,” Clarke said.
