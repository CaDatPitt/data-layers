Due to the, iact"that the interesti in
baseball aft the University, of Pitt.5-
burgh was no.t sufﬁc-iently great— and

has been decided upon by the Athletic
Committee it was determm-‘ed that
there should» be no Intercollegiate
baseballifor the Panthers this year.
There will be a substitutefor; the
inter—sch001 game, however, and.accord-.
ingly intercollegiate baseball matches
win be replaced by inter-department
and inter-class league games. No coach
will be provided,‘but a manageriwill be
‘in chargeito work upthe schedules and
stir up interest. Lsoine eou1p_Lme.nt_vLV111
be furnished by the athletic authorities.
This move will Lalso solve the trouble-
some problem "of interference with the
military drill of the students, which al-
most made it ‘necessary’ to iliminate‘
baseball last year. ‘
Under the new plan. more students
will~..be able to partic1p»ate.m baseball
material will be de-
veloped for future varsity teams, and
thegeneral interest in the Sport will
be enhanced. Last year Pittphad the
best team in its history and ‘one of
the best college aggregations in ,the
country, it provided a high class coach
in Walter Blair, and its games were all
absolutely free to ‘the ‘public. Yet for

Lieutenant Boarts
was assigned to the Oﬁi-Vcers’ School
‘for ;Pla'sti_c'.and Oral Surgery, which

lV’VWed11iesday night for a. faculty rn'il-

itary drill and an extremely interest-
ing and equally pleasant evening fol-A

”~l.ow.ed. After about 90 minutes of

:“right dress, left‘ dress, right face, left
face, about face, attention, salute,” the
Vconimandantt and’ soldiers decided to
call ‘it vac h:alt. . ‘ A

* Dr. Haslett remarked '_that he had
always wondered why so‘ much time
was spent in teaching soldiers such

\

‘weeks of this stuff he doesVn’tt care
how soon he gets killed.

 Zugsmith balked after ‘the of-
rﬁcer in charge had issued a half ‘dozen
seern'ing.ly contrary orders. For
time it seemed as‘ if it would be nec-
essary to call a court-martial -of in-
subordination, for when the officer
demanded to know why the doctor
made no attempt to execute coni-
inands, Doctor Zugsmith informed
him" that when an ofﬁcermakes up his
mind what he wants toido. he must
try to do it. D 1 V ’

A Shortly thereafter Dr. McParland
threw down his gun in disgust and
resigned from the regiment with the
statement that he “wouldn't work for
any fellow that changes his mind so

.yo_ften.” _
Dean Friesell had the best record 1

for the evening in soldier-ing. He was
always right, according to the ofﬁcer
in charge,':and every other member of
the company waswrong; at least all
the others were made to line up after
each maneuver alongside of the dean,
who played right end. . A’
Conimandant Meller was highly
pleased with the ‘evening’_sV work and
greatly impressed with the new
scheme in open-order tactics that was
