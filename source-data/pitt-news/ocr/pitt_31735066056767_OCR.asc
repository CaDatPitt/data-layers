Detre to help lead UPMC through Clinton's healti

By Travis Senseny
Staff Writer

.Dr. Thomas Detre will help lead the
University of Pittsburgh’s Medical Center
through times of change in the health-
care ﬁeld.

President Bill Clinton’s health-care
reform package has several implications
for the UPMC, according to Detre, senior
vice chancellor for Health Sciences.

“Everybody will be affected. The U.S.
health-care system is based on piece-

meal work, which means when you

become sick. every aspect of your med-

_ icalcare is billed,” he said. “This will

change, therefore, all medical centers,
large and small, must become more cost
efficient.” .

The example Detre gave of “piecemeal

.work” is an appendectomy, where there

is a bill for the operation, a bill for the
anesthesia, a bill for the hospital stay,
etc.

Detre said that Clinton’s package has
further implications for academic health

‘centers. He said that academic centers

have certain advantages’ but also disad-
vantages, as compared to ordinary
teaching hospitals.

The advantage is academic health cen-
ters have to be “on the forefront of inno-

vation,” maintain “high visibility” and
command “greater respect.” “University
hospitals also enjoy the benefit of
knowledge transfer,” Detre said.

The disadvantage, according to Detre,
is academic health centers are obliged to
serve society differently, and they need
to develop more cost-effective methods
to invest into programs. “Ordinary hospi-
tals don’t have this burden or advan-
tage,” Detre said.

Detre will assist his colleagues in set-
ting priorities in regard to academic pro-
grams.

“It is not just my task. I will help by
focusing people’s attention.>We will all

participate with the medical center to
increase cost effectiveness,” he said.

Detre’s current responsibilities include
academic oversight of the Pitt School of
Medicine, and he is an active participant
in the planning of activities in the med-
ical center.

Detre originally planned on retiring
in July or August, but was asked
by Chancellor J. Dennis O’Connor to
stay because of the new health-care sys-
tem. O’Connor has postponed the subse-
quent search from the fall until the
spring.

Detre has been the senior vice chan-
cellor for Health Sciences for 10 years.

Activities
promote
fire safety

£1W2lf€I1€SS

By Krista Haag
For The Pitt News

Fire Prevention Week
continues today with a
variety of activities to
inform Pitt students about
fire safety.

Director of Environ-
mental Health and Safety
Larry Keller said he hopes
to achieve» four objectives
this week during the
events.

The first is to make all
students, faculty and staff
aware of the needs of fire
prevention, and how to
behave if they are
involved in a fire. Second,
to get the students
involved with methods of
preventing ﬁres, he said.

“It seems the only time

students are exposed to
fire prevention is when
-they hear the fire alarm
go off in their dorm in the
middle of the night,”
Keller said. “We want to
be available to the stu-
dents this week and make
them enthusiastic about
fire safety.”

The third and fourth
objectives of the week are
to make the students
more aware of ' fire—fight—
ing devices before they
need to use them and to
just have some fun.

“Fire is an ongoing
threat,” Harold Hicks, a
fire protection engineer
from the ‘Office of
Environmental Health and
Safety, said.‘ “We all must
be on our guard at all
times to protect ourselves
and others.”

Fire extinguisher -
demonstrations with stu-
dent participation, a
Bucket Battle involving
students and some faculty
members and a Turnout
Relay Race involving
teams of 10 dressing and
running in ‘fire gear are
so.me of the fun-filled
activities planned for the
rest of the week,‘ Keller
said.

“Get Out, Stay Out —
Your Fire Safety
Response,” the week’s
theme, marks the anniver-
sary of “Mrs. O’Leary’s
cow” kicking over a
lantern in a barn, which
caused the “Great
Chicago Fire” of 1871.

Placement Center explores employer contact

Last month we talked about
the value of gainingexperience
during your years at Pitt to
increase your “job marketabili-
ty.” But all of that experience
won’t do you much good unless
you know how to effectively
communicate what you can
offer to an employer. In the
next few columns we’re going
to cover the basic methods of
employer contact '— resumes,
cover letters, telephone tech-
niques and interviewing.

While most of us find writing
resumes a tedious process at
best, it’s well worth the effort.
Think of it this way —— recruiters
normally spend an average of
30 seconds scanning each
resume that comes across their
desk. With only a half-minute of
someone’s attention, you must

imake every word and phrase

count.

Start by taking an inventory of
your skills as a job candidate.
What do you want employers to
know about you? Whether it’s
grades, experience or extracur-
ricular activities, it is important
to identify your unique and
individual strengths. Your next
step is to incorporate these

' cerns about

strengths into a concise, read-
able summary.

Typically, resumes contain an
“Education” section, followed
by “Experience” and
“Activities.” Under the educa-
tion heading, many students
have con-

listing their

plished and for what areas you
were responsible. Don’t just
write that you were on the
membership committee of a stu-
dent organization —- describe
what your role was in achieving
results. Second, use action verbs
(such as “man—
aged,” “coordi-
nated” and

grade point “designed”) to
average. A describe your
rough rule experiences.

better mer-
its inclusion on a resume. If
your academic record“isn’t as
impressive as you’d like, there
are some options. You can list
your overall QPA, just your QPA
in your academic major or your
QPA over the past few semes-
ters. Whatever method you use
in your calculation, make sure
to clearly label it as such on the
resume (i.e. Major QPA — 3.2).
When drafting the experience
and activities sections of your

resume, follow these three

guidelines. First, let the reader
know what you have accom-

items that you

.consider most important. For

example, you’d want to include
greeting clients and coordinat-
ing schedules in your summer
internship description and omit
your filing duties.

After you’ve printed out your

resume; make sure that it’s com-

pletely free of typos, and that it _

has a crisp, professional appear-

ance. The computer labs and

laser printers around campus
can solve a lot of your problems

J in this area, but don't rely solely

on the computer’s spellcheck
programs to catch all mistakes.
Look your resume over careful-

ly before making multiple_

copies. Better yet, have a friend
review it also.
I’ve covered just a few resume

_writing basics in this article. If

you need professional help and
advice in drafting your resume,
the Placement Service in 224 of
the William Pitt Union offers
resume critique sessions

throughout the week. Call us at‘

He reminded everyone to
always lock their door, even if
they are in the room sleeping or
are only going to be gone for a
minute.

Grier said for those students
that live off-campus, the depart-
ment of Public. Safety will do
free apartment surveys. He said
it is best to have the surveys
done before signing the lease so
students can notify the landlord
of changes that need to be
made.

According to Grier, campus
police can't enforce the
changes, but they will make stu-
dents aware of how to make
their apartment safer. It is still
important to have the survey
done even if the lease has

. already been signed.

Campus police officer Curtis

, Smith told students about his

Buy Yourself A Minute pro-
gram, which helps in develop-
ing survival skills.He said he
uses the ABC method. —
Awareness of Behavioral
Change. Students should be
aware of their surroundings and
be aware of other’s movements.

“Desperate people will do
desperate things,” he said. “This
is why it is important to learn to
think on your feet.”

As for those people who
wanted to know if they should
use chemicals like mace or pep-
per mace, Walt Waters, interim
director of the department of
Public Safety, said‘, “Always
remember that mace, or any-
thing that is used for your per-
sonal safety, can be turned
against you.”

This doesn’t mean that stu-
dents should not carry these
products, it only means that

they should be trained in how
to use them, Smith said.

A representative from the
Bureau of Liquor Control
Enforcement explained “Act 31”
of the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania to the students.

“This act imposes serious
penalties, including loss of dri-
ving privileges, upon persons
under 21 years of age who use
or purchase, attempt to use or
purchase or transport alcoholic
beverages through the use of
false identification or other-
wise,” Gary Holland said.

Holland explained that any-
one who makes or sells fake
IDs could be charged with a
second-degree misdemeanor.
All the investigators are trained
to recognize false IDs, and they
wear plain clothes in order to
blend in with the college crowd.

On the average football
weekend about 35 to 40 Liquor
Control Enforcement officers
are on campus, Holland said.

Pat Catena, a member of the
Student Government Board
Public Safety Committee, said
he thought the seminar is very
useful, but more people needed

' to attend.

“The apathy level at the uni-
versity is sad. Our university
would be a safer place if more
people would come [to these
seminarsl,” he said.

Jennifer Kinchen, a member
of the Campus Women’s
Organization’s Safety Commit-
tee, was also disappointed with
the turnout at last night’s semi-
nar. “The students are con-
cerned about their safety on
campus, but they are apathetic
in taking positive action con-
cerning their personal safety.”

]ustz'ce, not revenge

The trial of four Muslims, accused of mastenninding
the bombing of the World Trade Center in New York
City on Feb. 26 of this year, opens this week in federal
court. .

The terrorism these men are accused of waging can-

not be forgiven and must be answered for. But this

highly-visible trial of those accused of committing the
first act of terrorism on American soil, must not be one
of revenge — but one of justice.

Muslims, especially those of Arab origin, have histori-
cally been labeled as the enemy, and more recently,
have been stereotyped as terrorists. It is important to
understand that not all people of Arab originor of
Islamic faith are terrorists.

In this terrorism case it would be very easy for those
on the jury to deem these men guilty before evidence is
entered and the accused are permitted to state their
case. The public has been outraged at the bombing of
the World Trade Center, a barbaric act which took the
lives of six innocent people and injured roughly 1,000
more. Many Americans are desperate to see those who
are responsible pay for what they have done to our
sense of security. ,

As it turns out, the prosecution in the case, led by
Assistant US.’ Attorney Gilmore Childers, has very little
concrete,evidence to prove these men guilty. Childers
said no one will testify that they saw a bomb being

made or saw one being driven in a rental van to the

underground garage of the New York skyscraper.
However, Childers said in his opening statement that he
will present evidence which will tie the four men
together and to the bombing. ‘

It -is painfully evident that much of the prosecution’s

evidence is circumstantial. Usually that isn’t enough to
warrant conviction in a court of law. The four defen-
dants may very well be guilty of the crime, but the case
against them must be airtight. Hopefully, as the court-
room drama unfolds, this will become evident.

In the past, law enforcement officials, as well as the
American people, have been hasty in laying the blame
for various crimes. '

Many Americans would like to see this case come to a
swift close so we can put this entire thing behind us.

The case of the assassination of President John F.
Kennedy in 1963 is perhaps an idealexample. The fed-
eral government, in the interest of the American peo-
ple, looked for a culprit, and in its haste, may have
overlooked signiﬁcant details of the case. A great many
Americans today don’t believe the government’s story
of Kennedy’s assassination. As many books and publi-
cations contend, America may have had the wrong
man. i

This case is a tremendous test on our judicial system.
We are challenged with the task of giving. the defen-
dants as fair a trial as possible and assuring that justice
is done, and revenge is not sought.

GOP is political party of exclusion

Last April I was elected vice president of the University Democrats. Based on what Chad
Devinney of the College Republicans said (The Pitt News, Sept. 28), I, as a minority, was elected
by sympathy. Mr. Devinney was quoted as saying that Democrats “try to pull the sympathy rou-
tine when talking about minorities.” He said that his party has always been inclusive of minori-
ties. ‘

This is the same party whose leader for four years, George Bush, ran one of the most blatantly
racist; ads j,du_r'ing§ his. 1988 presidential campaign. I. am speaking of the advertisement "in which
Bush attacked Michael Dukakis’ granting of “furloughs” to prison inmates (An idea that actually
originated in the Ronald Reagan White House.), especially one Willie Horton, a black man
whose menacing mug shot was ﬂashed on the screen. The ad (in not so many words) said, “If
you elect Michael Dukakis, black men like this are going to be freed and come and kill you.”

During his term in office, Bush vetoed an inner-city aid package. The bill would have given
$57 million toward the rebuilding of these areas to which expedient attention and assistance is
of utmost importance. It also took the president over a week to visit the devastated areas of Los
Angeles that were ripped apart by the L.A. riots.

This is also the party whose most infamous senator,']esse Helms, has for years faithfully
brought up for renewal the patent on the Confederate ﬂag. That ﬂag is one of the most concrete
symbols of racism that exists. .

All this to say that the Democratic party is a model of racial equality and race relations. Bill
Clinton’s handling of the Lani Guineer nomination and subsequent retraction was an abomina-
tion. But Clinton also appointed many African Americans to his cabinet, not from sympathy, but
because they are qualiﬁed. Clinton’s cabinet is the most racially diverse in history, a far cry from
the “old-boy network” cabinets of Reagan and Bush.

I wrote this not as the vice president of the University Democrats, but as an African American
who strongly disagrees with Mr. Devinney’s comments. .

The party of inclusion? I think he needs to take a closer look at the people he sings the praises
of. ' ‘

Pitt isbeing foolishwith Mt. Graham project

I grow wearisome of the debate about the number of squirrels on Mt. Graham. I wish to point
out a few problems with the Forest Service and the University of Arizona’s logic.

The UA continually refers to studies that show how the red squirrel’s population is stable and
increasing in the face of continuing destruction‘ of their habitat. One can only assume that the
university honestly believes any such study has been conducted to any degree of accuracy,
since no respectable institution would make such a blatant lie. In fact, it has spent over $1 mil-
lion lobbying Congress to have the project exempted from any such study. The U.S. Fish and
Wddlife Service did in fact conduct a study in 1988 and found that the telescope project would
have no negative impact on the squirrel population. 4 

The authors of that study testified in 1990 before the Congressional Oversight Co ittee that
the study was fraudulent, and that they were ordered by their superior to write that conclusion
regardless of the data. *

The only two scientists in the world who even consider the project to have no impact on
squirrel population are two biologists, both of whom are on the payroll of the UA. Numerous
scientific fellowships, including the Society for Conservation Biology, have stated opposition to
this project. ~

And yet, the University of Pittsburgh is still considering becoming a partner in this project.
How could the chancellor of the University of Pittsburgh, with his doctorate in biology, be
fooled by such childish behavior displayed by the partners in this project?

Pitt dominates
Duquesne in  
short order,
715-8, 15-8, 15-12

By Jason Feuchtwanger
Stajf Writer '

The Pitt women’s volleyball
team traveled to cross-town
rival Duquesne (10-5, 3-0 in
Atlantic 10) last night and got
exactly what was expected of
them — a win.

The Lady Panthers (12-4, 4-
O in the Big East) easily han-
dled the Lady Dukes, as they

- won three games to none (15-

8,15—8,15-12).

But the Lady Panthers were
sure not to take an over-
matched Duquesne team
lightly. .

“I’m pleased for a couple of
reasons. One is that Carrie
Thornton [was] out [and Pitt
still won]. [The other is] we
thought Duquesne was really
going to give us a battle,” Pitt
head coach Cindy Braziel
said. ‘‘It’s an in-town rivalry
 [they have] ‘a lot of kids
from Pittsburgh who didn’t
end up at Pitt. I thought we
played real consistently and
real strong.” ‘

Pitt assistant coach Brian

Women's tennis swept at Cost Center

Robert Morris overpowers Pitt for second straight time this fall

By Sean Duncan
Staff Writer

The women’s tennis teanr

hosted Robert Morris College
yesterday at the Cost Center.
Robert Morris dropped Pitt’s
record back to .500, 4-4, as it

swept Pitt in both singles and’

doubles competition.

There was some sunshine
though. Pitt showed much
improvement from the last time

. it played Robert. Morris.-

Just as Pitt has a young team,
dominated by mostly sopho-
mores, Robert Morris has a

A younger team. Five of its six

seeds are first-year players.
Although Pitt got swept,
don’t let that fool you. Five of
the 13 sets went to tie breakers.
Three of which were in the bat-
tle of the No. 1 seeds ——- the
Panthers’ Alison Baker and the

Colonials’ Natalie Arvelo. The
marathon match lasted approxi-
mately one hour and 55 min-
utes. Finally Baker, who played
great tennis, fell a little short,
losing in three sets, 6-7, 7-5, 5-
7.

, No. 2 seed Marla Zielinski
faced off against Alexis Smidt.
It too was a grueling match.
Zielinski looked sharp as she
took the first set into a tie
breaker but lost 6-7. She then
ran out of gas in the second
set, losing 2-6.

The lone seniors of both
teams squared off against each
other as Pitt No. 3 seed Barb
McCarthy faced Erin Shlegel.
McCarthy lost 4-6, 1-6. .

Unfortunately, she lost in a
valiant effort, 6-7.

Kristen Siegel, the No. 5
seed, lost 2-6, 2-6 to Melissa
Lockhart, and No. 6 seed Becky
Elliot fell to the hands of
Heather Tyler, 3-6, 1-6.

In doubles competition,

The other two matches were
not so close.

Pitt head coach George
Dieffenbach was encouraged
by the team’s performance.

“This was a lot better show-

ing for the team this time

. around.‘ The scores were a lot

closer,” Dieffenbach said.

“We contended against a
really tough team. Even though
we lost 9-0 in matches, we
tried "our best out there and it
shows in the scores of the sets.
[We scored] a lot of points, but
couldn’t close out the matches,”

3 The Pitt News

One team controlled the sea-
son, having the division in its
pocket from basically start to
finish. It faltered a little, only to
step it up a notch when the
bad boys came a-callin’.

The other stumb1ed~out of
the blocks, falling deep into the
trenches of its division before a
blockbuster trade and awak-
ened stars pushed it to the title
on the final day of the season.

The two teams are, of course,
the Philadelphia Phillies (col-
lectively a few sandwiches
short of a picnic) and the
Atlanta Braves, the National
League’s two division champi-
ons. The setting is the National
League Championship Series.

On one hand it looks like the
‘70s Orioles — ‘90s—style — as
the Braves possess every great
pitcher, it seems, since Christy
Mathewson.

But on the otherhand, the
two are very similar with two
offenses that can light up
scoreboards like "Tommy."

Catcher: — Greg Olson and
Damon Berryhill are a solid
tandem behind the plate for the
Braves. They are both above
average defensively and can
contribute at the bottom of the
Braves lineup. Olson, who sat

out last year’s playoffs with a,

broken leg, will be ready to
come back with a couple of big
games. .

Darren Daulton is perhaps‘

the best catcher in the major
leagues. He leads the offense,
directs the defense and runs

' the clubhouse. When the Phils

went through their ﬁrst big los-
ing streak of the season, it was
Daulton who stepped up and
publicly chastised the staff —
Tommy Greene in particular —
for not giving quality innings.

Talented Braves too muchfor gutsy Phillies in NLCS

EDGE: PHILLIES

First Base: — Philly's “Pretty
Boy” john Kruk is the soul to
Lenny Dykstra’s' heart on this
squad. At times, Kruk carried
this team, giving offensive sup-
port and leadership to a ship
without a rudder. As Peter
Gammonssaid, he has the
potential to hit ﬁve home runs
in the series and has- been
among the league leaders in
the batting race for the past
three years.

Atlanta’s fire dog, Fred
McGriff, was the final piece to
the Brave’s Championship puz-
zle. Without him, we’d be talk-
ing of Will Clark right now. He
provided immediate home run

power and protection for T eny

Pendleton since coming over
from the Padres in a trade for
. nothing. It cannot be over-
played how much he has
meant to this Atlanta offense.

EDGE: EVEN '

Second Base: — Mickey
Morandini of the Phils hit .247
in what has probably been the
best season of his short career.
His defense isn’t exceptional
but gets the job done, and he
can surprise you with the stick
— even though he chokes up
more than a pony leaguer.

The Braves’ Mark Lemke isn’t
Robby Alomar and he isn’t
Ryne Sandberg. But it seems
when the calendar hits October
he dons an afro, changes his
number to 44 and answers to
the name Reggie. His .252 aver-

age this year is nothing special,

but it wasn’t last year or in ‘91
when, had the Braves come
away with the World Series, he
would have run away with the
Series’ MVP award. I

EDGE: BRAVES

Shortstop: — Pugs, you
were right. Kevin Stocker has
had an exceptional season
his promotion to
Philadelphia from triple-A earli-
er in the year. He has hit .324
since just before the All-Star
break.

Jeff Blauser has done it all
this year for the Braves. This
hasdefinitely been his break-
through season, as the short-
stop hit .305 with 15 home runs
and 73 RBIs. The first-time All-
Star isn’t flashy but will consis-
tently make the routine, and
occasionally the spectacular,
look easy.

EDGE: BRAVES

Third Base: — Dave Hollins
is one of the chief loons in a
ward_ full of maniacs. He bat-
tled injuries, knocking the ball
around during his periods of
relative health. Though danger-
ous on offense, Hollins will not
remind any Philly fans of Mike

‘Schmidt at the hot corner.

Terry Pendleton is the
unquestioned leader of the
Braves and a consummate team
player. He proved this early in
the season byfwalking off the
field when Braves pitcher
Marvin Freeman refused to
throw a retaliatory beanball,
after an Atlanta hitter got

plunked in the previous inning.
Forget his average numbers this
season — 172 hits, 17 HRs, 84
RBIs — he always comes up
with the big home run, the big
hit or the big defensive play.

EDGE: BRAVES

Left Field: —— The ‘Phils’ pla-
toon of Milt Thompson and
Pete Incaviglia get the job done
when called upon. If Inky gets
into one of his hot streaks as

he did earlier in the season, he"

could really turn the tide.

Pitt Lacrosse eyes repeat success m 1993  

By Brady Slater
Staﬂ Writer

A 1993 National
Championship and a 50-9
record over the last three years

' ‘are’ accomplishments that usu-

ally command attention. But
the forgotten Pitt lacrosse team
has had to enjoy its success in
relative obscurity.
- Now heading into the 1993-
94 season, the Pitt lacrosse
team wants students to know it
is a winning program the carn-
pus can be proud of.

“Last year was really incredi-
ble,” Josh Gochnauer said. “It
was our first year in the league,

and everybody wrote us off.
But we went into Loyola
[College in Baltimore] and won
the championship 10-9 in over-
time on their home field.”

A repeat of last year’s

National Collegiate Lacrosse
League (a club and junior varsi-
ty league) and a 17-4 record is
what the club is striving for
again this season.
‘ “We’d love to repeat,” Coach
Gary Neft said. “And again this
year we’ve upgraded our
schedule to get more competi-
tive.”

The team has lost a few of its
key players. Goalie Michael
Shiner, attacker Scott Gordon

III--' STUDENT

GRNMEN T  

and midfielder Lee Stember are
all gone from last season’s
team.

“Even without Gordon, Ed
Croot and I should be able to
carry the scoring load, but los-
ing Stember will hurt,”
Gochnauer, the team’s leading
scorer the last two seasons,
said. “But then again, we didn’t
have Lee when we won the
championship.”

“Theteam we put on the
field will be very good,” Neft
said. “We’ll just need some of
the freshman to step up and
give us some depth. And I have
a freshman goalie, but I don’t
know if he’s ready yet.”

The Pitt lacrosse team real-
izes that —— with the addition of
16 rookies to replace the play-
ers the team lost — it may have
to change its style of play.

“We’re going to have to slow
down the tempo of our games
this year,” Croot said. “We’ll
have to play more of a control
game.”

“Our scoring will probably
go down,” Gochnauer said.
“But our wins shouldn’t go
down.” A

The Pitt lacrosse team begins
its season this weekend at the
Bluegrass Lacrosse Festival at

game,” Driscoll said.
Outside hitter Ann
Marie Lucanie was in her
usual all-conference
form, leading the Lady
Panthers with 16 kills.
Lucanie was named Big
‘East Player of the Week
last week, making it her
third time in four weeks.

Game 2 was a‘ virtual ‘

replay of Game 1. The
Lady Panthers jumped
out to an early 7-2 lead.
But Duquesne didn’t lay
down for the Panthers
and made a run of its
ownlto pull within one
point, 8-7. Pitt called a
time—out to regain its
composure. Pitt stifled
Duquesne after the time-
out, allowing only one
Duquesne point for the
remainder of the game.

It appeared that Pitt
had the third game all
wrapped up at 14-7, but
after a Pitt service error
which made it 14-8, the
Lady Dukes rattled off
four straight points.
However, Duquesne’s
thoughts of forcing a
fourth game were snuffed
out when it made two
straight errors. A service
error gave Pitt sideout,
and the Lady Dukes pro-
ceeded to commit a hit-
ting error to give the
Lady Panthers the game
and the match.

With middle hitter
Thornton not playing in
the game, first-year stu-
dent Laurie Fernandez
ﬁlled in and was a solid
contributor to the Pitt vic-
tory.

“This was a big match
for Laurie. She’s been a
little nervous, she had a
transition as a freshman,”
Braziel said. “We’ve had
hef set, we’ve had her
hit, now she’s hitting
right.

"That’s a lot for a
senior to do, let alone a
freshman. I finally said,
‘Laurie just play. Play
hard and just swing at
the ball’  and she did.”

The Lady Panthers will
be home for a Friday
night contest against
Villanova, but admittedly
are looking down the
road to when they play
nationally~ranked New
Mexico.

“New Mexico is our
next nationally-ranked
match. Everyone [on the
team] is focusing on pick-
ing them off,” Braziel
said.

“Our goal is to  focus
on picking off New
Mexico.”

“Right now we’re, play-
ing a lot of conference
teams. Not to badmouth

them, but they’re not.

ranked,” Driscoll said. “If
and when we beat New
Mexico, it would be an
upset.”

EDGE: BRAVES

» Center.Field: Otis Nixon
lends a stellar outﬁeld glove
and blazing speed to the
Braves’ lineup. He covers an
enormous amount of area" in
center field, which will key
the Braves’ defense.

. Lenny Dykstra has laid his
claim to the National League
MVP award with a standout
‘93 campaign. His aggres-
siveness on the bases is

‘unmatched by. any other

player in the league, and
this year proved that he is
the finest leadoff man in the
game today. His ability to
get on base could be a deﬁ-
nite key in a series that
might come down to a few
one-run games.

EDGE: PHILLIES

Right Field: — Wes
Chamberlain has yet to
prove himself as a full—time
major leaguer.‘ He has the
potential to hit stratospheric
home runs
likely potential to strike out
four times in a game. Jim
Eisenreich platoons with
Chamberlain in right.

David Justice proved that
his rookie campaign was no

_ joke with an outstanding all-

around season in ‘95 — 40
HRs,; 120 RBIs. The attitude
that marred his rep during
his first two‘ seasons has not
shown itself this year.

EDGE: BRAVES

Starting Pitching: — We

will spare you any elabora— .

tion on the Braves’ staff, just

 but a more.

- to say that it is the major
league’s best rotation in «

years. The Phils have three

- horses in Tommy Greene,

Terry Mulholland and Curt
Schilling that can dominate
on any given day. But, ulti-
mately, they will not be able
to pitch their way past
Atlanta’s four aces.

EDGE: BRAVES

Closer: — Depending on
which Mitch Williams shows
up will be the key to
Philly’s success in a tight
ball game. Will it be the
man who blew several con-
secutive save chances down
the stretch or the one who
was nearly unhittable in the
majority of his 43 saves?

Greg McMichael has been
nothing short of incredible
since his call up. His 19
saves and 2.06 ERA proves
that, at the moment, he
could hold the upper hand
on the Wild Thing‘, who has
lived up to his name during
the Phils’ stretch run. Then
again, he's still a rookie.

EDGE: EVEN
Manager: — The biggest
decision that Phillies

Manager Jim Fregosi had to
make this season was
whether or not to get near
John’Kruk when he was eat-
ing. Bobby Cox is totally
overrated. I don’t care what
people say. (That’s JB talkin’
— I disagree.)

Translation: This is a hard-
ly a Tony LaRussa vs. Jim
Leyland matchup.

EDGE: EVEN

Fans: — There. are maybe
a dozen true Brave fans
(pre-Pete Smith injury) in

this world, so to talk about
them would be to give cre-
dence to their God-awful
tomahawk chop. In
Veterans Stadium, the visit-
ing Bravos will have the
majors’ most obnoxious
fans, as well as the Phanatic,

, to contend with.

EDGE: PHILLIES

Schneider’s Wisdom: —
I could think of nothing
more gratifying than to see
a picture of every b1ubber—
ing Bravo fan when Nails
slides in with the winning
run in the bottom of the
ninth of Game 7.
Unfortunately for the Phils

—— and Bucco fans looking

for a little payback — this
series should never reach
Game 7.

If the Philly pitchers can
keep a few games close,
they might have a chance.
But to do that, they have to
hold Georgia’s Power
Company to a minimum.
Don’t count on it.

SCHNEIDER
BRAVES IN SIX

J.B.’s pick: —- Don’t
count them Phillies out
before the series begins.
They have the pitching to
carry them for a while in
close games and the offense
to bust out with a couple of
five run explosions.

But Atlanta’s pitching is
like ‘Lucky Charms: magical-
ly delicious. They’re just too
tough in a short ‘series —
that type of talent could
lead to three or four
shutouts.

Assembly

Continued from page 1_
While Pitt has a debt compa-
rable to the lower third of the
Big 10, its credit rating is there,
too.“This is our fault. This is

- what we are about to do [to bet-

ter Pitt’s credit ratingl,” Tuchi
said. “We have a $307 million
debt compared to Penn State’s
$700 million debt  and [Penn
State] has a better credit rating.”
In other business, Professor
Herbert A. Chesler spoke to the
assembly about the new
changes, which were unani-
mously voted in for Pitt faculty’s

family medical and family leave.

policy. He said that the policy
should allow faculty their regu-
lar salary for up to eight weeks

for illness, birth or other tempo-

rary disabilities or injuries. The
old policy allowed six weeks of

paid absence.

The leave, in the case of preg-
nancy, may begin before or
after childbirth and is not neces-
sarily continuous. Salary pay-
ment for leaves of this nature

will be funded by central uni-5

versity funds.
Another facet of this policy is

the proposal of an additional 18

weeks of paid absence for seri-_

ous illness or injury, as long as a
physician’s statement could
prove the legitimacy of the
claim.

Chesler also discussed
parental leave, new to the facul-
ty medical and family leave pol-
icy guidelines. For childbirth,
four weeks of paid leave is
allowable and one week for an
adopted child. Funding of pay-
ment, as well as finding another
to fill the instructional time, will
be covered by the university.

Under this new policy an

_ unpaid family leave is allowed

in the event of a child, spouse
or parent’s illness with their job
still secured when they return to

work. As a final addition to the .

old policy, any absence of
longer than four months does
not count toward one’s manda-
tory tenure review. Absences of
four, or less than four months,
leaves the facilitator the option
to request the tenure review be
delayed. The process, however,
may only be delayed for a maxi-
mum of three years.

AIDS

Continued from page I
decided that it was time for
the Pitt community to become
informed about AIDS.

AIDS education programs
have been available to-Pitt
since 1985, and AIDS tests
have been conducted since
last year, according to the
SHS.

SHS works in conjunction
’ with the Forbes Clinic to offer
a variety of AIDS-related pro-
grams, according to Clinic
Manager of the Forbes Clinic
Jan Devoe. She said the SHS
administers the AIDS tests,
and the Forbes Clinic pro-
vides both before and after
counseling sessions.

The SHS provides speakers
for any class, and they can be
very ﬂexible depending on
the class.“We can highlight
different areas of the issue

' according to what the profes-
sor wants,” Miller said.

According to Devoe, SHS
and the Forbes Clinic deal

' with hundreds of students a

year. “People need to contin-
ue getting -the education,”
Devoe said. “People are still
underestimating the serious-
ness of this epidemic.”

Other examples of Pitt lead-
ing the way in the field of
AIDS are the UPMC-affiliated
Pitt Men’s Study, the
Pittsburgh AIDS Center for
Treatment and the Pitt
Treatment Evaluation Unit.

-The Pitt Men’s Study bk

in 1985 as a study of the 

ural history of HIV infection
in gay and bisexual men,
according to the Health
Sciences News Bureau. It is
one of five sites in the country
that make up the Multicenter
AIDS Cohort Study, the
longest continuous study of
male homosexuals and bisex-
uals.PACT provides primary
medical care to persons with
the HIV infection and AIDS,
according to _ the
Administrative Director of
PACT and PTEU Cynthia
Klemanski. “The medical care

involves diagnosing any prob-
lems that patients have
because they are HIV-positive
and the treating of them once
identified,” Klemanski said.

Klemanski said that AIDS
has been increasingly talked
about since she began at
PACT, but that the‘discrimina-
tion against AIDS patients has
continued. “Some of the prej-
udice has to do with homo-
phobia,” Klemanski said.
“Some people fear because
they think we.don’t know all
there is know about transmis-
sion.” -

Klemanski issued “a call for
compassion” to all people to
help end the discrimination
and concentrate on preven-
tion. “People who are not
[HIV-positive] should do
everything possible not to
become so,” Klemanski said.
“The general public is better
educated, but there is not
enough of an acknowledge-
ment on how serious the
problem is.” '
