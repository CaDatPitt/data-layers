Underage drinkingpolicy stops some fromcalling cops

Estelle Tran
Senior Staff Writer

At a South Oakland apartment party
last year, a Pitt student with eyes’ closed
vomited repeatedly in a kitchen garbage
can. He wouldn’t or couldn’t talk, and his
limbs were so limp that he couldn’t clutch
the sides of the bin. '

“We can’t call the police. He wants to
be a teacher,” his friend said.

Curious strangers, dressed in Hal-.
loween costumes, "gathered around ask-
ingrquestions and offering unsolicited
advice. . , A

“Don’t let him lie down.” B

‘‘Is he drinking water?”

“If he’s puking, he’ll be fine.”

Instead of calling for help, the friends

stayed with the intoxicated student,

throughout the night.
Like many students who get sick while

drinking underage, the group didn’t seek
medical attention because they feared
they would receive citations. '

Whereas there are a few places where
an intoxicated Pitt student could have a
run-in with a campus police officer, Pitt’s

‘zero-tolerance alcohol policy leaves ques-

tions about whether students would be
cited while seeking medical assistance.

The elephant in the room

Pitt police spokesman Ron Bennett said

UPMC Presbyterian Hospital in Oakland»

contracts Pitt police officers to maintain
order in the emergency room on Friday
and Saturday nights. He said their job
is not to .watch for Pitt students or spot

underagedrinkers‘, andthat people who "

receive alcohol-related citations gener-

ally don’t get them at the hospital. v
“If, say, we’re out on the street and

we run into a person who is intoxicated,

they get taken to the emergency room. If
they go to the ER, the citation goes with
them,” Bennett said.

Pitt spokesman John Fedele said in
an e-mail that Pitt police officers aren’t
stationed in UPMC Presbyterian for the
“sole purpose of ﬁnding underage drink-
ers.” .

He said Pitt police are responsible
for using their own discretion if they’re
involved in the transport of intoxicated
underage students. V _

“Pennsylvania law is enforced for
underage students who areifound in-
toxicated just as it would be for other
underage individuals found drinking in
Pitt’s jurisdiction,” he said.

Pitt’s Judicial Board also hears cases
when students violate the Student Code
of Conduct by drinking underage. The
Judicial Board may impose a $75 fine for
the first offense and $125 for the secon
offense. A '

Students who violate the alcohol poli-
cy on.or off campus also have to complete
the four—week Personal Education, As-
sistance & Referral class and will have
a letter sent home to their parents or
guardians.

Calling 911 instead of Pitt police might
not keep the police or the University out
of the loop. Bennett said that police often
arrive withemergency medical services
to record the incident.

Many schools, like Harvard and Car-
negie Mellon, have amnesty policies so
students won’t worry about receiving an
underage drinking citation when seeking

. medical assistance from their universi-

ties. i

‘ CMU’s Student Health Services web-

site says, “Studentsfor whom medical
assistance is summoned for alcohol in-
toxication will -be granted amnesty from

In Schenley Plaza Saturday evening, Pitt
junior Erik Haupt rubs his sore knees
and chats with his friend Julie Kepics
about the dance party he attended the

poisoning at that party, he’s helped them

Corbett visit remains a
mystery two weeks   later

Katherine Sandler
For The PittfNews

Republican gubernatorial candidate Tom
Corbett"s~visit to Pitt remains a mystery
almost two weeks after he was spotted
on campus. .

* State Attorney General Corbett walked

_ out of the Cathedral of Learning Sept. 9

shortly after 10:30 a.m. after a “private
meeting” on campus, according to Pitt
College Republicans president Rachel
Feinstein. The unexplained visit to campus
leaves the prospects of a gubernatorial de-
bate at Pitt, which was originally scheduled
for tomorrow, extremely slim.
Democratic gubernatorial candidate.

. Dan Onorato agreed injune to a debate at

Pitt, whereas Corbett has yet to respond
to theinvitation, said Graduate and Pro-
fessional Student Association president
Nila Devanath. ’

Since Corbett’s meeting at Pitt, no of-
ﬁcials for his campaign have made any
statements regarding the meeting. His

campaign has not returned more than half I

'a dozen calls for comment. _
Feinstein said at the time that the meet-
ing was not a public campaign event, and

   

refused further comment at the time. This
past week, Feinstein said she had no new
information to share regarding Corbett’s
campus visit.

In mid—June, the GPSA contacted both

candidates in hopes of hosting a debate. ‘

Devanath said the Onorato campaign ac-

— cepted the invitation onjune 22, but since

then his campaign said they would not-be
at Pitt tomorrow —— the scheduled day for
the debate. ' . '

Devanath said Onorato might partici-

pate in a later scheduled debate, but it .

depends upon Corbett’s appearance.

Corbett’s'campaign did not inform her
of the meeting, Devanath said, and officials
from the Republican Committee of Allegh-
eny County declined to comment on it.

Since the primaries in May, Corbett
has not made any campaign appearances
on campus. _

Spokesman for the Onorato campaign
Brian Herman said that Corbett’s appear-
ance on campus was “interesting” but de-
clined to commentfurther. -

Currently, Corbett is not scheduled
to make a public campaign appearance

at Pitt. Regardless of Corbett’s actions,"

Onorato will visit Pitt before the election,

. Herman said.I

She and Haupt agreed that they would
call the police if they thought a friend’s
life was at risk.

Two years ago, Pitt started a three-
points campaign to teach students about
how to confront situations ‘ in which
friends might be suffering from alcohol
poisoning. At orientation, Pitt students
learn to “be afriend, know the signs and
call for help.”

Students also take a mandatory online

Alcohol-Wise training program.

These programs teach students that
they shouldn’t be making the judgment if
a friend needs medical attention or not:
Director of Residence Life»Shawn Brooks
said when resident assistants seean in-
toxicated student, they are trained to call
the campus police immediately.

“I tell my RAs that I don’t want you to
be responsible for another life,” Brooks
said.

The baby on the church doorstep

To avoid the police, Officer Bennett said

people who drink underage sometimes
drop off their friends at the hospital. B
“We try to discourage [leaving friends
alone], but we appreciate them taking the
person to the hospital,” he said. 1
Though some still worry about the of-

. ficers at the hospital, many people believe

the hospital to be a type of sanctuary.
Haupt has heard these sort of stories

- passed down the vine. ‘

“It’s like putting a baby on a church
doorstep,” Haupt said. “But, I’d be afraid

of the guy getting energy and stumbling.

away.”
Abandoning someone on the hospi-

tal’s doorstep might create new problems, —

though. A
Dr. Donald Yealy, chairman of the De-
partment of Emergency Medicine at Pitt,
said there have been issues when the hos-
pital is ready to discharge someone who
was admitted for/alcohol poisoning. \
Admitted patients can leave the hospi-

tal when they’re stable, even if all of the.

alcohol hasn’t metabolized, Yealy said.
But, the hospital needs to make sure the
person has someone to take him home and

that the hospital can follow up if the per- V

son has lacerations or other wounds.

_ “[The hospital] would only reach out
to Pitt if no one can take them home,”
he "said. ' '

Yealy said hospital workers don’t call
the police to report underage drinkers.

-“It’s not our job nor, is it our desire to
have that job,” he said.

‘ The -hospital only contacts a patient’s

- g parents if he’s a minor.
Kenyon Bonner, director of Student -

Life and an Alcohol Task Force member,
said Pitt’s judicial process would consider
if a person was cited while trying to help a
friend. He couldn’t speak of any outcomes
of judicial cases. -

Geneticallymodifying  

Would you like your salmon blackened,
broiled or genetically modiﬁed?

The U.S. Food and Drug Administra-
tion will hold public meetings this week
on AquAdvantage Salmon, genetically
engineered Atlantic salmon. The FDA is
expected to decide this month whether
to approve thevGE salmon for human
consumption.

We prefer our sushi not contain mutant

ﬁsh.

AquAdvantage Salmon is an Atlantic
salmon with a growth hormone from a
Paciﬁc salmon, the Chinook salmon and
genetic material from the ocean pout, an
eel—like animal. The borrowed genetic
material fromthese other species cuts the

30-month growth period of the salmon in ,
‘half, reports CNN. ‘

The altered-ﬁsh developers say that it
is as safe to consume as farmed Atlantic
salmon. P

, But the safety of farmed ﬁsh consump-
tion is still disputed.

The only beneﬁciary of modiﬁed
salmon would be the salmon industry,
which stands to make larger and faster
proﬁts.from a faster growing ﬁsh species,
according to CNN. *

Since we don’t work in the salmon in-
dustry, we can’t really see any good in hav-
ing these freak ﬁsh on our dinner plates.

But we can see what possible conse-
quences the approval of GE salmon could

_ have.

First, it’s unclear whether there could
be health consequences from eating the
GE salmon. The salmon contains a growth
hormone, and is likely to be treated with
antibiotics like other farmed Atlantic
salmon. V

animals a fishy prospect

“It’s impossible to talk about the risks
other than saying that they haven’t been
properly assessed, other than [the] pro-
cess has been rushed and we don’t know,”
Wenonah Hauter, executive director of
Food and Water Watch, told CNN. “[The
FDA] can’t ensure the safety of the foods
they currently regulate.”

If the FDA gives GE salmon its approv-
al, it will be the ﬁrst genetically modiﬁed
animal permitted by the agency, reports
CNN.

This will likely set a precedent for
other genetically modiﬁed animals. If this
becomes a trend, what’s to say we won’t
also see cows with rhinoceros growth
hormones and chickens somehow merged

with pterodactyl DNA?

- GE salmon will also have environmen-
tal consequences, in addition to the conse-
quences of farming ﬁsh in general.

According to CNN, “it has been proven
that escapes from ﬁsh farms into the natu-
ral population are inevitable.” So when
the “franken-ﬁsh” escape, they will likely

threaten the already severely endangered .

wild salmon population.
When new species force their way.

into an area, they upset the balance of c
the current ecosystem. This is why Asian
carp moving .into the Great Lakes is huge a
problem; they disrupt the food chain that

1 supports the lake’s current inhabitants.

Imagine the upset with genetically modi-
ﬁed X-Men-like ﬁsh. .

A With current trends towards eating
local and organic products, GE foods seem
like the opposite of what people want.

Let’s not take a food known for its
health beneﬁts and turn it into some sort
of distorted super-ﬁsh science project. I‘

EDITORIAL

Mark Kozlowski
Columnist

There are times when the earth convulses
and shakes and what was once thought irn- '
possible now seems inevitable. Iwas shocked
to read that Richard M. Daley, after 21 years
as mayor of Chicago, has decided not to run
for reelection. Only 13 of the last 55 years ‘
have featured a mayor other than‘ Richard M.
Daley or his father, Richard]. In a two—part
series, I will consider the legacy of Mayor
Daley the Younger, and then consider the
scramble to replace him.

Why should we consider Chicago in a
student paper 500 miles away? Simply this:
The ideas that have been tried in the nation’s
third—largest city will serve, for better or
worse, as models of city governance around

' the country. Indeed, one of Daley’s more

boneheaded ideas— leasing the city park-
ing meters —— was proposed in Pittsburgh.
Pittsburgh and Chicago also remind me of
one another — two cities that were founded
as Gateways to the West, that prospered
based on speciﬁc industries while having to
re-invent themselves in order to survive, and
that have been heavily Democratic since the

1920s.

There have been a few upsides to the
reign of Daley 11. Chicago hasn’t turned into
Detroit yet. Much of Chicago’s economy used
to revolve around stockyards and railroads.
It can’t do so now, and fortunately, it doesn’t.
Downtown has been revitalized, and because
people actually live there, many have an
interest in continuing revitalization.

But at what cost have we had the Chicago
Renaissance? Bankruptcy. The deﬁcit of the
city of Chicago is estimated at $654.7 million
in a budget that tallies $3 :39 billion overall.
The deﬁcit has not been helped by projects
like the tragicomic Olympic bid and Millen-

_ nium Park being ﬁnished four years late and

way over budget. V

Can Chicago recover from the deﬁcit? Not
bloody likely. The mayor has already leased
two major city assets, the parking meters and
the Chicago Skyway, the toll road from Indi-
ana to downtown. Sales tax has gone from
a scary 10.25 percent to today’s merely outra-
geous 9.75 percent. The mayor has promised
not to increase property taxes, hotels are
already heavily taxed, and even if a proposed
lease of Midway International Airport goes
through, it would raise $2.5 billion, enough _
to plug budget shortfalls for only four years.

Corruption doesn’t help this picture very
much. The price for bribes, preferential
hiring and kickbacks is ultimately paid by
the taxpayer. Corruption has been king in
Chicago for a long time, and the Daley years
are no exception. Mayor Daley’s patronage
chief, Robert Sorich, was convicted of mail
fraud for “rigging a hiring scheme to reward
clout—backed job candidates withjobs and
promotions,” according to the Chicago
Sun-Times. The city water department was
embroiled in a scandal where trucks were
hired to sit around and do nothing. In the
mid-719905, the FBI spearheaded Operation
Silver Shovel, which ended up convicting six
aldermen and other local officials of accept-
ing bribes. While the mayor himself has not
been indicted, it seems quite clear that the _ 7

. culture of corruption was hardly booted out
byhis administration.

Daley II also leaves behind a legacy of
forcefulness. From the time when city bull-
dozers destroyed an airport in the middle of
the night without the sanction of the Federal
Aviation Administration to the mayor’s
quixotic quest to put a children’s museum in
Grant Park in spite of _a century—old ban on
construction in this location, this Daley, just
like his dad, has let very little stop him.

The mixed legacy of Chicago Mayor Daley

Mayor Daley has gotten a lot of favorable‘
coverage for his reform of education. But
how useful was that reform? The Chicago
Public Schools reports some alarming sta-
tistics. Of all 11th graders, the 33.7 percent
of students who meet or exceed Prairie State
Achievement Exam standards in reading
is down from 35.5 percent in 2001. Only 16
percent of black students met or exceeded
standards in math in 2001 and 2o1o.Other
statistics show similar slides, no improve-
ment or only slight improvements. The
PSAE is required of all high school students
in Illinois. I took it in 2007 and can say it
is not especially hard. The reading portion
asks you to read simple business memos.
Granted, the Illinois Standard Achievement
Test test scores of 3rd through 8th graders
show marked improlvementlover the same
time period. But by the time those same kids
reach 11th grade, their scores are universally
dismal;

" A ' The legacy of Daley is mixed. How it is
. perceived depends on whether the mount-

ing problems he presided over will end up
looming larger than the positive aspects of
the administration. - .

One year ago, Tim Tobitsch was showing V"

police officers tax documents to get behind
wired fences and into his Downtown hot dog
shop, Franktuary.

The security zone set up for the G-20 I

Summit made it almost unbearable for him

to get to his business, let alone for the _cus‘—‘.

tomers to work their way into it.

To blow off a little steam, Tobitsch and
his business partner, Megan Lindsey, will
host a G120 Plummet this week. From 16
am. to 3 p.m. Monday through Friday, the

shop at 325 Oliver St. will serve hot dogs

Ketchup,’ mustard and relish will lace the :

‘dogs’, as well asless conventional items like
artichoke hearts, mango salsa and pierc-

gies.

“The suffocated pierogi symbolizes our
city’s immobilized economy,” Frida Mar-
quetza, a publicist for the shop, said.

Tobitsch, like many other Downtown
business owners, said he lost money dur-
ing the Summit. He estimates that he and
Lindsey lostabout 75-80 percent of their
projected sales for the week of the Summit
events, or about $1,500. at —

“The Plummet is intended to be ‘a fun way

buy these shirts in the meantime and think
it’s funny with us,” Tobitsch said.

It’s not the ﬁrst time Tobitsch has tried to
release some Summit—related frustration.

Tupac’s 
mother
continues

his work 

Andy Tybout
Assistant AE-3+E Editor

Whereas many fans remember Tupac’s ver-
bal dexterity and his tragic passing, Afeni
Shakur remembers her son’s street-smart
approach to education.

“One of the things that my son used to
d_o all the time, consciously, was to inter-
relate with people who were different, anus‘.
to make a pact with them: You teach me
this, and I’ll teach youthis,” she said in
an interview.

Shakur, mother of late hip-hop legend
Tupac, stopped by Pitt on Friday to cham-
pion this attitude of community better-
ment in her keynote address at the Black
Action Society’s Indaba ceremony, an

annual swearing in of the organization’s

steering committee. The hour-and-a-half
event took place in the William Pitt Union’s
Assembly Room.

Before kicking off the ceremony, Shaktﬁ
said she was honored to be a part of the
proceedings. »

“This is a placerwith a group of people
with real history,” Shakur told the enthu-
siastic crowd. ‘Her speech touched upon
subjects as disparate as her history with
the Black Panther Party, suicide and lo-
cal food. 2 ' ‘

Above all, she rallied people to, as she
said in the interview, “Get up and do some-
thing” in their community.

Shakur said the Black Panthers — which
she joined in 1968 _in New York City, as"$'
high school dropout — helped instill her
with this sense of public welfare. Contrary,
to popular perception, she said the party
was .initially more hospitable than mili-
taristic.

“In the black community, we co e
plained a lot about us not being able to‘

businesses experienced.

“We intend to hold future Plummets
whenever a Summit needlessly interrupts
the lives of peaceful urban dwellers some-
where in the world. Like—minded businesses
in Pittsburgh and elsewhere are invited to
join the movement,” Marquetza said in a
news release.

Tobitsch chimed in, “I’d like to stress that

natured fun and aren’t trying at all to be
spiteful, so hopefully it doesn’t come across
that way. We just want to show the creativity
and resiliency of Pittsburgh that everyone
was supposed to see during the G—20.”.

agree on anything,” Shakur said. “The
Black Panther Party was a way to get to-
gether — different people from different
places in life.” '

She said the party’s convergence of
worlds was egalitarian.

“The Black Panther Party was every-
body in our community,” she said. “I was
a high school dropout, but I got to work
and learn alongside people who were
Ph.D.s.” A

But, Shakur came to realize that the
Panthers couldn’t fully grasp the conse-
quences of their actions.

“When the repercussions [to being I

a member] came, a lot of people fell. A
lot of people folded. A lot of people were
destroyed,” she said. “As an activist, we

"_,.j?;1_shouldn’t be an activist and expect that we

would not be hurt, put in j ail. We shouldn’t
do it and then think everyone should stop
everything they’re doing and raise bail
money for us.”

In April 1969, soon after she joined
the party, she and 21 other members were
arrested and tried as conspirators on mul-
tiple counts. This was much to Shakur’s
surprise.

“I really couldn’t understand: What was
I being arrested for?” she said.

At the time, she said, it was the longest
trial in the history of New York. If she and
her co-defendants had been convicted
they would have been sentenced to what
seemed liked 350 years in jail. Rather than
disheartening her, it was this possibility
that led her to dismiss her soft—spoken at-
torney and testify in her own defense.

“I fully expected to be convicted,” she
said. “But if I had to go, I certainly didn’t
want to go without speaking up for my
own self.” 4

The move didn’t ﬁnd much favor among
her co-defendants.

“There’s a real long list of words they
use for ﬁery women,” she said‘of the others
on trial. “They used them all on me.”

But miraculously, it worked: The entire
group was acquitted.

While Shakur’s life since has been rife
with pain — most famously, her son was
shot and killed in 1996 — she now seems
to have found hope in another community-
based endeavor: youth—oriented philan-
thropy. .

“I’m a real believer in learning and in
education,” she said.

Shakur organized the “Keep the Youth
Alive” campaign, an effort to reduce
teenage mortality, and founded the Tu-

513.?

   

pac Amaru Shakur Center for the Arts,
an establishment in Georgia for creative
young people.

On the local spectrum, Shakur ex-

pressed enthusiasm for the Community
Empowerment Association in Homewood,
which she visited prior to the ceremony.

“One of the best things that has hap-
pened to me coming to Pittsburgh was
the 10 minutes that I spent there,” she
said. “We saw young people helping young
people.”

If there’s one institution Shakur thinks
is failing in community engagement, how-
ever, it’s hip—hop. '

“When Haiti happened, when Katrina
happened, did you not all feel: Where is
hip-hop?” she said. “I’m a little pissed.”

But at 63, Shakur is too experienced to
let this anger get the best of her. Rather,
she re—afﬁrmed her dedication to coun-
terattacking the street problems that, to
some, might seem overwhelming.

g “No work that I can do can bring my
son back,” she said. “I don’t do it for my
son. I do it for these children who are

_ still left here with the same problems that
existed when Tupac was shot. Nothing has
changed in that situation. That’s pretty
much my life. That’s all I care about.” I

AN 0LTMANN’S OPINION

Heisman hopefuls  

emerge early  

Alex Oltmanns
Sports Editor

 

We’re still in the early going for the col—
lege football season, but it’s never too
early to start thinking about the Heis-
man Trophy.

With all the talk about Reggie Bush
giving his Heisman back, it got me think-
ing about who’s positionedthemselves as
the top five front-runners for the award
this season.

Kellen Moore —- QB Boise State

Like the song says, all he does

0 is win. Moore is 19-1 in his col-
legiate career and it’s looking like that
trend will continue as this season pro-
gresses. The only thing that hurts him
is the fact that his team is in a smaller
conference and doesn’t play many high-
caliber teams. But he still made a state-
ment in the season’s opening week when
he led the Broncos to a win against Vir-
ginia Tech and passed for three ‘touch-
downs. If he can lead his team to a win

over Oregon State this week, the rest of .

Boise State’s schedule sets up for what
could be another undefeated season.

Ryan Mallett e QB Arkan-

sas The former transfer from

0 Michigan has made his pres-

ence felt in the Southeastern Conference
and is establishing himself as arguably
the best quarterback in college foot-
ball. He’s coming off a 380-yard, three
touchdown performance against Georgia
on Saturday, where he threw a 40-yard
touchdown with 15 seconds left to take

the lead. His 6—foot-6 frame makes him 1

stand out, but his stats do even more. Af-
ter three games this season he has 1,081
passing yards, nine touchdowns and only
two interceptions. His matchup against

Alabama this week will say a lot about .

his Heisman can’didacy._

Mark Ingram --_- RB Alabama
Yes, I know-that heis theincum-_
0 bent winner of thegaward, and

missing the first two games of the season _{
with an injury allowed otherplayers to
A steal some of hisispotlight, but he made. :
an emphatic return to the ﬁeld on Satur- if

   

day, with a 151-yard output on only nine
carries against Duke. What will hurt In-
gram’s chances even more is the fact that
the Crimson Tide features another future
NFL—caliber back in Trent Richardson, so
Ingram might not see as heavy a work-
load this year. Add to that the fact that
there’s only ever been one repeat win-
ner of the award — Ohio State’s Archie
Gr-ifﬁn in 1974 and 1975 — and Ingram’s
chances go down even more.

Terrelle Pryor —- QB Ohio State

The Pittsburgh native is show-

O ing everyone why he was‘ the

high school player ofthe year in 2008 as
he leads the Buckeyes, who are on their
way to No. 2 in the polls, in both passing
and rushing. He already has a signature
victory this year with a 36-24 win against
Miami where he couldn’t be contained,

rushing for 113 yards. If Ohio State runs ‘

the table in the regular season, which is
a real possibility, then Pryor will prob-
ablywin the Heisman, but that’s a long
way to go. A

Denard Robinson — QB Michi-

gan Robinson has burst onto the

0 scene after three games this sea-

son to emerge as the most electrifying
player in college football right now, and
it’s not even close.eI mean, c’mon. This
guy is the leading rusher in the NCAA and
he plays quarterback. He runs the 40-
yard dash in 4.3 seconds and he doesn’t
even tie his shoes, earning him the nick-
name “shoelace.” Michigan needs to keep

“winning for Robinson to win the trophy
_though, because if it starts losing games

when its tough Big Ten schedule rolls
around, Robinson’s HeisInan_hopes will

take a serious hit.

Now, it’s early, and thislist couldnlchange
drastically as the season continues.

.Pitt’s own Dion Lewis’ Heisman’

chances went down after. the teams’ first
couple of games, but don’t count out the
former Big East Offensive ‘Player ofthe
year. i ; * ”' -

A win _against‘Miami on Thursday
night could go a long way to putting him
back in the forefront of the Heisman
conversation. l l i

A MCT Campus
Michigan’s Denard Robinson — who doesn’t tie his shoes — is the nation’s leading
' ~ rusher, and he’s a quarterback.
