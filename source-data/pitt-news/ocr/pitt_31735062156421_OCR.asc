his son, Dr. Cliff Carlson, ad-

Chancellor Rufus H. Fitzgerald said ‘ Monday thatlltthe
University hopes to build dormitories “so that we may draw

Dr. Fitzgerald made the statement in conjunction with
an announcement on the most‘-

up with the New York Life Insur-
ance Company to set aside a plot
on the lawn for the union. Plans
were in the advanced stages, but
had to be discarded when the.
trustees took their stand.

Alan Magee Scaife,‘ president of
the Board, of Trustees, said: “This
feeling of keeping the lawn clear
does not necessarily conﬁneitself.

ing of alumni.” He added. that,
“The intensity of this feeling is so
great that I doubt if new build-

Variety Club Assists

Festival

Committee 0

By NANCY COOK

A serious purpose will be behind the color and gaiety

, of Spring Festival at Pitt this year. '

The 1953 Festival, “Showtime,” 'will catch the glamour
of show business in Broadway shows, Tin Pan Alley, the
circus and opera, but it will also demonstrate the backstage

kindness and generosity of the en-6

tertainment world. A
‘Cooperating with Variety Club,
national organization of enter-

tainers, Spring Festival committee '

has agreed to donate half of the
Festival; proceeds to a Pitt s(;hol-
ars_hip for an orphan.

Policy 22" Years Old ~

This plan follows a policy start-
ed 22 years ago when Variety Club
was founded in Pittsburgh. A
group of showmen adopted a
foundling. Since then “tents”
springing up in cities support an
orphan and often send him to col-
lege. ' -

The Pittsburgh chapter of Va-
riety Club will support, a child
until he is of college age. Then
Pitt will chip in with 1953 Fes-
tival money and the child will at-
tend college.

Variety Club will add a more
professional touch to students’ tal-
ents by providing “theatrical per-
sonalities during Festival Week.
They will also help the committees
by donating their facilities for a
large—scale publicity campaign.‘ \

“Showtime has ‘two major pur-
poses,” Harris said. “First, it en-
ables a boy or girl, who otherwise

would not have the chance, to
study at a great center of learn-

«ing. Second, it provides the op-

portunity for students to use all the
power of their imagination and the

In other words, this is the heart
of Pitt.”

Piﬂ"s Research Team Advances Medical Frontier. . .

  Polio Progress Was

By GEORGE L. SALIM
(This is the second of a series discussing the work of Putts

I .
medical research teams).

.Correlating the results of other researchers with the

facts unearthed in his own investigations enabled Dr. Jonas»

E.'Salk to announce to the nation a potential vaccine for

ppoliomyelitis.

Dr. Salk’s radio speech, of Mar. 26 revealed some of the

background of polio research andé

_some of the problems faced by his
research team in the quest for an
effective preventative. In the doc-
:tor’s own words—“the ' progress
—. . . is not merely a collection of
haphazard incidents, but rather a
series of episodes that ﬁt together
in an orderly manner.”

In 1909, monkeys were inocu-
lated with material from a polio
patient resulting in paralysis of
the animal. The disease’ was thus
reproduced for the ﬁrst time in an
experimental ‘ animal.

Microbe Classiﬁed

. From this experiment, the mi-
crobe was determined to belong to
the organisms classiﬁed as viruses.
It had the properties of being sub-
microscopic and‘ of- not being able
to-~multiply outside of the aﬂlicted
body.

In 1931, it was established that
more than one type of polio virus
existed. In thevnext twenty years,
systematic study revealed that
probably not more than three types

of viruses capable of causing the V
same disease—polio-—were preva- ‘

lent.

The three viruses are _similar
in that each of them can pro-
duce paralysis as a result of po-
lio. * When polio strikes, it may
or may not leave its victim par-
alyzed. It is prevention of this
paralysis that is being sought.
Thethree viruses differ in that
one can immunize against its
same type only, and not against
the other two viruses.

. Thus it is possible for a person
who has had a paralytic attack be-
cause of one type virus to suffer a
second attack later in life from one
of the other two types. Even a
third attack is possible until all
three viruses have produced polio,
and maybe paralysis, at “different
stages of life. This knowledge
made it basic that any vaccine
should immunize against all three
viruses to achieve protection.

Polio Left Antibody -

Next it was established that re-
covery from polio left a substance
in the bloodstream called antibody.
When injected into the blood-
stream of susceptible persons or

animals, this antibody can prevent A

polio viruses of ‘the same type
from ‘causing paralysis.

“The prevention of paralysis in
this way was first demonstrated in
laboratory animals,” said Dr. Salk.
In addition, antibodies contained
in gamma globulin and introduced
into the bloodstreams of children
gave resistance to paralysis for a
brief time.

At this point, the results of the
research, to date were crystal-
lized and several deﬁnite ideas
were set. First, polio is not too
‘different from other diseases

I

Second, a ‘vaccine capable of
producing antibodies should be
effective. Third, such a vaccine
should be effective for a suf-
ﬁcient period of time, or should
be capable of being reinforced

at intervals. And fourth, the '

vaccine should be preventative

against the three viruses without

danger of producing the disease
itself.

The problem of obtaining an
adequate supply of the viruses was
solved four years ago by Dr. John
F. Enders of Boston. He discov-
ered that all three polio viruses
could be propagated in test tubes
containing living tissue. Human
and animal tissues, kept alive in
test tubes, are infected withrpolio
viruses. Using this principle, the
raw materials for_the vaccine are
now derived from "monkey. tissues.

The key to vaccine as provid-
ed by Dr. Salk was the mixing
of the virus with mineral ail.
At ﬁrst, a. water basewas used

Orderly‘

and 71 test inoculations were
made with the water-virus mix-
ture. The results proved unsat-
isfactory. The decision to use
the mineral oil base evolved"
from Dr. Salk’s experience with
ﬂu vaccines which utilized the

, same ingredients.

The vaccines with the mineral
oil base brought good results in
tests on moneys, Then 90 volun-
teers were inoculated,
though these tests are incomplete,
it is pointed out that antibody for-
mation lasting at least four and a
half months has resulted. It is
signiﬁcant that Dr. Salk’s conﬁ-
dence in his work was "demon-
strated by the fact that one of the
ﬁrst to be inoculated with the new
vaccine was his youngest son, Jon-
athan, seven months old at the
time.

County Tests Planned

_Dr. Salk is the ﬁrst to caution
against over—optimism. He states
that success can be achieved ‘only
by patient and careful step—by-
step experimentation before an ef-
fective preventative is ﬁnally de-
veloped. Meanwhile, test inocula-
tions in Allegheny county are be-
ing planned to hasten this final de-
velopment.

, The next article will give some
highlights of Dr. Salk’s’ ﬂu re-
search.) ~

The A’r’ri’rucle Changes

By Gene Weinsiein
In April, 1935, Dr. Frederick Butel, a one-time

. Pitt instructor, charged ‘that the University was

“known all over the country” for its ﬁring of'_‘pro-.-
fessors with unpopular political \/iews. At this time
Pitt was on the black list of the American Asso-
ciation of University Professors as a result of the
dismissal of Dr. Ralph Turner and other in-

Explaining the Turner inci-
dent, Chancellor Bowman said
that the history profe”ssor’s .“sar-
castic, flippant, isneering” atti-
tude towards religion caused his
ouster. The bulk of -the evidence,
however, indicated that this was
‘not the‘ real reason for the ﬁr-

ln aletteit to‘ Chancellor Bow-   . . -
man, Gov; i..Pin'c'hot, the -;Republican , leader, said
that Dr. Turner’s dismissal was one of a series
of incidents that indicate that P_itt’s “purposes as
an‘~insti’_tu_’_cion of higher. learning have" been per-
«vented to conform to the views of a small group
of wealthy and powerful men.”
_ “_Every- fact . . .” Gov Pinchot continued,
“. . . that has come to my attention shows that the
actual-reason for dismissing him was that his parti-
cipation in efforts to secure liberal, social and labor_
legisla-tion_w‘as displeasing to these men . . .’.’. '
Lil"l'le Meaning in 1935 »

Obviously academic freedom, which connotes. a

V

‘ faculty and student body seeking the truth with-

out fear of reprisal, had little meaning, in 1935.

But some years later, Pitt, deservedly, was back
in the good graces of the AAUP. A new series of
incidents under a new Administration revealed a
drastic ‘change in the University’s attitude towards’
academic freedom, for during the A/past several

.\

Senate Committee‘ Report Shows . . 

    

years ‘Pitt has resisted the attempt of outside‘
pressure groups to .silence teachers.
Differed Politically 9

Judge Blair Gunther, for example, had attacked
Dr. Marion Hathaway of the Social Work School as

a subversive. No one ever seriously‘ challenged Miss

Hathaway’s professional competance (the test of

-any teacher’s worth). Her sin was to differ politi-

cally with Mr. Gunther and his friends.
i Since space limitations prevent a, fuller develop-
ment of the treatment given Miss Hathaway, I can

only suggest the signiﬁcance of the incidents re- .

volving about her. The fact that she left Pit_t"_ot
her own violation to accept as better post indicates
that the Administration was unwilling to let outside
groups dictate political morality to its faculty. The
fact that, when‘ Miss Hathaway was attacked by
Giinther in the Pitt News, a large group of the‘
faculty sprang to her defense shows that the at-
mosphere at Pitt was far more- clear than had
once been the case. 
No Ban on Speakers . ,
Soon afterwards, the Administration’s behavior
following Henry _Wallace’s unsuccessful attempt to
speak here suggests that, while it did not welcome
in the future controversial ﬁgures, it would not
ban them. \ ' ,
The Administration’s refusal to let a small but
vocal group prevent Dr. George Counts, the Co-
iembia educator, from speaking here last year dis-
closed a determination to maintain academic free-
dom, even if it entailed possible bad ‘publicity.

E The new Administration’s attitude showed a
welcome contrast to that of its predecessor’s in
the thirties. Two years ago, in 1951, the.Pitt com-
munity was to show its appreciation of the value

. of academic freedom by its behavior in the loyalty

oath controversy, which: will be discussed Friday
in the next article of this series.

Too often we’ve heard students -

But thefad is not unanimous. .—
Dr. Jesse Stuart, main speaker
at the Write’rs Conference today"

Interviewed by letter, this fa-

In 1947 McCarthy was also be-

settle up on a loan. At that time
the Banking and Currency com-
mittee was trying to ’decide
whether to discontinue price con-
trols and rationing on sugar. Mc-
Carthy attacked the controls and

. recommended they be abandoned.

During the same period a Pepsi-

a $20,000 note for Sen. McCarthy
which the latter’ used _to under-
write his debt at the bank. Pepsi-

Pete is_the number one teacher
of creative writing.

“Several years ago, he and,I

both had work appearing regu-

larly in Esquire magazine, where
I ﬁrst saw his name.”

A few years later Prof. Peter-
son, ,
"writers conferences, invited Dr.
Stuart to come here. .

“That conference,” writes Jesse

9 Stuart, “I shall never forget. It
was a" lively thing. Each of us‘

took our turnspeaking, and after
the talks all of us ~- ate, talked,
laughed, had a great time. '

Carthy’s indebtedness to his home
bank was $69,540 in excess of the
legal limit of loans to a_ single

The money was borrowed for

It .s against the law for,a can-I '

didate for public ofﬁce to promise
an appointment to a public or
private posi_tion in exchange for
campaign support. ‘During the
1946 campaign M_cCarthy .re-

ator hired both Kiermas and his
wife to his Washington oﬁice staff.
Later Kiermas pledged another
$10,000 from his savings as more
collateral on the troublesome Mc-
Carthy bank loan.

And so goes the senate ‘com-
mittee report, on and on. As we
said before‘, no comment is nec-
essary. ..

if he is not scheduled to talk.

Danville senior is eager to stick in the lineup for the full

Thinclads Look to_Penn Relays
After Second’ Dual Meet Loss

By DAVE MAZER
After ' injuries hit the Panther
thinclads in their opening two dual
meets, Coach Carl‘Olson is hoping
to have a physicallyﬁt squad ready

for the Penn Relays Friday and .

Saturday at Philadelphia.
_Olson plans to send a twelve-

A man group to Philly in the form of

shuttle hurdle, mile, and four-mile
relay teams. _

The shuttle hurdle relay of Wal-
ly Monahan, Bill Ruschel, Chris
King, 7and Don Kennedy placed
third in last year’s competition and
Olson feels that this same quartet
should be “up there in the running
for ﬁrst place” in this year’s pro-
gram.

King Doubtful ,

Of course, -a great deal will de-
pend on whether Chris King, who
did not run last Saturday against
Miami, will be available this
weekend. The soph from Washing-
ton, D. C., injured his ankle in
practice last week and Olson is
still unsure if King will be ready.

The four—mile team will consist

of Co-Captain Bernie Luterancik,
Don DelliGatti, Dan Sommer, and
Alan Gunderson and the ‘mile re-
lay will have Joe Dudas, Ray Lee,
Norm Kutcher, and either Bruce
Giron or Chuck Fritz.’ ’
Last Friday for the second
straight year, the Panthers lost a
close decision to the Miami Red-
skins, 631/2-581/2. Although the
Blue-and-Gold took ﬁve ﬁrsts in
the individual events, plus the mile
relay, they. couldn’t muster up
enough seconds and thirds to gain
the win.’ ’ . , -
Pitt winners included Monahan
in the high and low hurdles,
Ruschel in the broad jump, Lu-

’ terancik in the two-mile, and Dan

Sommer in the 880-yard run.

Five ex—Pitt football stars have

Timers football game May 9. '

Carl DePasqua, the only back
in the group, is currently taking
courses at Pitt. The other four
are: Bill McPeak, Steeler defen-
sive end, George Radosevich, re-
cently discharged from the Ma-
rinés, Charley Yost, a member of
last year’s grid squad, and Tony
Razzano, ex-wrestler and gridder.

As in the past the strength of
the Old-Timers’ squad will come
from the ranks of last year’s sen-
ior players.

tor, saidthat Joe Schmidt is try-

31-Year Regime
Ends With Doc

By BORIS WEINSTEIN
Sports Editor

 

Thirty—one years of basketball ended yesterday when

‘Dr. H. Clifford Carlson stepped down from his post. His

retirement as basketball coach suddenly finds Pitt without
its most distinguished and famous athletic leader.

A gentleman who certainly gloriﬁed‘ the University from
"coast to coast with his ..Figure Eight and Charley Hyatt
‘during his years as coach reached the national’ spotlight
-several times and, on a few occa- ‘
sions, faltered to the emptiness of
defeat. S -

IBut, through all of these
years it can unquestionably
be stated Dr. Carlson was -one
of basketball’s most unique
contributors. ‘ ‘

His purpose was not "primari- -
ly to produce‘ a team that could

but, rather‘ to accomplish the feat _ , M
in a scientiﬁc way. The ends are the same, however, the perfection
and contribution Carlson fused‘ together from‘his plan overshadow
the mediocrity of the other method. , I

C'arlson’s approach was simple. We all are free to create great
and comfortable things, but how-many of us are able to utilize these
same elements into something outstanding? H ._

Desire, imagination and personal magnetism were three fun-
dainental "human attributes that Ca:-lson.stresse_d, to produce his
system in basketball. His way was an art yvhich could be ac-
complished only by learning to think and striving ahead. In
his book, “You and Basketball,” the good Doctor wrote: “The
building of a good foundation led to the world’s,grea‘test miracle.”

And this ‘initial layer of drive was valuable in the practice
sessions to mold a winner. “Deﬁnite desire, with faith,” he reason-
ed, “has all the laws for success to help it. A worthwhile desire,

I backed up with faith, will line up all your talents, thoughts, and

  Panther Proxy

 
   
   

energies, in a straight line leading to the goal of our achievemen .”
' Imagination, too, plays an important part in success, because it

/I is the “ﬁrst step in thinking and

higher planes of life.”
It was in this way,

a passageway from medocrity to

therefore, that Carlson produced his un-

defeated 1927-28 team and his classy ﬁves of the thirties. _And

the specimen of hiswork was best exempliﬁed in one Charley

_I<Iyatt who had the desire, imagination, and personal magnetism
to succeed as a great contribution in life.

Distance Hitting

From Unexpected‘ - Source--Filek

A player who didn’t hit one:
home run last year, and
whose only two extra-base
hits were a pair of doubles,’ has
stepped into the role as Pitt’s lead-
ing slugger. '

Shortstop Rudy Filek has‘ clout-

ed two home runs and a triple to
pace the Mittmen in the long-ball
hitting department in the eight
games to date. a,
, Filek recently treated the few
shivering fans who showed up at
Mellon Field last. week.to a sam-
ple of his power with a wallop of
over 400-feet. — -

As a rookie last year, Filek
broke into the lineup at third
base, from where Coach Ralph
Mitterling shifted him to short-
stop, and he has been there ever
since. .

In spite of his‘ .250 "average last
year and his present .258 mark,
Filek’s value- can be measured in
other terms. - \

Netters Eye WVU

After Cancellation.

After their ‘home opener was
cancelled yesterday, the Pitt ten-
nis team is looking forward to the
West Virginia match here Friday
for their initial win of the season.

Georgetown and Navy turned
the netters back, 8-1 and 9-0, re-
spectively last week. The tennis

record is now, 0-2._ _

Lining up for the Panthers are:
number one, Gene Weinstein, two,
.loe.Bendel and three, Dave Litch-
man. Harry Duncan, John De-
coux, and Jim Tully round out
the starters.

West Virginiahas most of their
team returning to wage battle.
They did however, lose its number
one and two men through gradua-
tion and may feel the loss.
