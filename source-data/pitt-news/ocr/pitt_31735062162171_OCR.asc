Gas Strike OnFor March 25 Furick Dames M°“°“i

BY RITA VITOLO
Another strike by Pennsylvania
service stations is still on for March
25 despite reports of increased

gasoline allocations to the state and 

rumors of a possible end to the
Arab oil embargo.

The Pennsylvania Service Station
Dealers Association [PSSDA] office
conﬁrmed Thursday their 5300

fﬁtnember stations will go ahead with

the strike called by the associa-

tion’s executive board in Philadel-
phia Wednesday night.

The dealer organization is asking‘
the Federal government for an
increase in gasoline allocations and
a freeze on wholesale prices, or a
roll back in prices to May 15 levels.

“Mr. Simon's 55 million gallons
don’t really offer our service
stations anything. The Federal
Energy Office keeps saying they’re

gonna do, do, do, and Ijust don’t
buy it,” said PSSDA official
Vincent Mancinelli. _

Governor Shapp said he received
a telephone call.Thursday morning
from an official of the Bureau of the
Budget in Washington who told
him Pennsylvania would receive an
additional 55 million gallons this
month. He expects the extra
allocation to carry the state through’
March. .

“March 25 is the day that we set
and we’re going ahead with it,”
PSSDA’s Mancinelli said, “Tenta-

S tively it’s still on, but we’ve been

providing for changes that are

I gonna be made. We’re as ﬂexible

as they [the FEO] are. If they want
to come up with more gas yet and
the rest of our demands, then
maybe we’ll sit down and see.”

’’'‘‘Financial Aid Unused I

1 Due to FederalFo,ul-up

' (I.-’

  

BY LARRY PAN SINO
Millions of dollars in academic

P scholarship money remains unused

because of a Federal program’s
late start, according to Associate

, Dean of Admissions and Student

Aid Charles R. Dees, Jr.

The Federal government's Basic
Educational Opportunity Grants
program, according to published
reports, allocated $122 million
when the program became law last
June, but by fall, only $60 million
had been distributed.

Dees explained that by the time
the government had made the
grants available “sometime after
July 1973,” most incoming stu-
dents had already settled their
ﬁnancial plans. This year only first
year students are eligible for the
grants, but upperclassmen can
apply for next fall's awards.

He said his office sent each
freshman a basic grants application
last August or September after the
government made the forms
available. Only 450 grants totaling

$105,527 were made to Pitt
‘students, an average award of
about $235.

“You have to be practically
poverty stricken to get a grant,”
said Dees. “This program is not
geared to middle income families.”

According to a New York Times
report, retroactive grant applica-
tions for this academic year are
being accepted until April 1. All
funds unused by that date are to be
distributed among the previous
recipients, making their‘ grants
larger,‘ the Times reported, but the
Office of Education is trying to

Any student wishing to apply for
a retroactive grant should pick up
an application form in the Office of
Admissions and Student Aid, 602
SU.

Dees said all students seeking-

aid from the University, as well as
all freshmen, will be informed of
the___basic grants for next year at an
earlier date. '

“At this institution, if gross
family income is above $12,000
with two children (or less), forget
about (applying for this grant). If
there are more than two children
(or if income is below $12,000), go
ahead and apply,” Dees advised.

greed to follow the Association’s
decision, and will close March-25
unless Thomas Anderson, PSSDA
executive chairman, tells them
otherwise. . _

“I personally do not want to go
out on strike, but I'll do it
anyway," said Gulf dealer Thomas
Pawlak. “I don’t know how much
more of this the customers are
gonna take--they were real good
about it last time, but I still don’t
like the idea of striking unless it’s
absolutely necessary.”

“We more or less want a price
freeze,” said Mobil dealer Jim
Koskoden. “Every first‘ of the
month the oil companies raise the
prices on you--they raised them the
first of December, the first of
January. They’re making us play
policeman out there on the island
and I for one don’t think the
Association ought to stand for it.”

Despite rumors the Arab oil
embargo may be lifted soon,
Oakland dealers expected that to
have little inﬂuence on the decision
to strike. Said Koskoden:
“Remember it's .gonna be six

weeks to.‘ three months till that oil —
gets sold at the pumps; We still

want to be protléctedgfor’ those three
months.”

Mancinelli likewise called the
rumors “too vague an issue” to
carry weight in postponing the
strike at this time.

Case of harassment .

i the conversion.

To Move Studio Theatre

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY

Student Government President’

Mike Furick denied reports Thurs-
day he advocated the conversion of
Studio Theatre into a gymnasium to
further his program of improved
intramural facilities.

He also denied a report by
Allocation’s Committee .member
Pat Cooper that he had advised the
committee to consider, ' when they
begin appropriating funds, that
Studio Theatre might not exist next
year.

The SG allocations committee in
response to Furick’s denials made
this statement Thursday evening:
“In response to the charge by SG
president Mike Furick that.Alloca-

tions’ Committee member Pat.;..

Cooper_ lied regarding Furick’s

._\statement to our committee Mon- _
day, March 11 on the conversion of

the Studio Theatre into a gymna-
sium, we the Allocations Commit-
tee, having witnessed .the ex-
change, hereby confirm that Mike

Furick did make such a state--

ment.” ,

Furick said he never suggested
“What I said was
misconstrued. They wanted more
money for sanders or something '

and I said that.upkeep was the

"5 function.

responsibility of the physical plant, 2
and we shouldn't be paying for it.

“There are no plans to move the
Studio/Theatre. They’ll be there
[in the Cathedral basement] for
umpteen years,” Furick said.

Attilio Favorini, director of the
Studio Theatre said the action was
unthinkable. “The Studio Thea-

tre cost nearly $40,000 to build,.to , 5

build it again today would -cost
nearly two or three times as
much.”

The Studio Theatre is an
organization for student-supported
acting and program production,
operating in the rennovated Cathe-
dral gymnasium which according to

J.J. Tierney, the Studio’s presi-‘
has nearly 400 active..

dent,
members involved in production.
Favorini said even the consider-
ation of the conversion move
indicated some lack of understand-
ing by Furick» of the Studio’s
“When you are dealing
with someone as anti-intellectual

and anti-cultural as Furick, it’s like '

beating your head against a brick

-wall. You have to point out the"
‘stupidity of his ideas. This entire
thing is ludicrous,” Favorini '

charged.

Announcing his candidacy for

Representatives Congressman
John H. Dent, Democratic repre-
sentative from the 21st District
called for a redirection of the
of the Nixon
Administration.

Dent stated he was" opposed to
the removal of all Federal controls
on the economy, a problem which
the Congress must act on in the
near future. “If you remove all

“If we allow all of the events in

between the officers on the scene

and Campus Police headquarters. K

“The witness who called the
incident in exaggerated it grossly,’.’
said McCullough. “It wasa case of
harrassment, obstruction of pas-
sage, which is a misdemeanor, not
attempted rape, which is a felony.”

Glowczewski was unavailable for
comment, but Officer Robert
Kolesky, the police union steward,
confirmed McCullough.’s version.
“The victim was upset and said he
attempted to rape her, but she later
changed her story and said no, he
didn’t do it.” .

The suspect was not arrested,
but was asked to come to police
headquarters. “The police can
only arrest a suspect if he [the
victim] sees it take place in the case
of a misdemeanor,” McCullough

said. Under the law, a person can»,

The impeachment question, ac-

should be acted upon swiftly by the

"far shown by the Executive branch.

“I think for the President’s own

sake, and for the sake of the

According to Dent, the House

. “Jerry Ford himself said when

 they were discussing the impeach-

 from the’ current foreign policy of

“You can bet whenever this

the Federal government as respon-
sible for the present petroleum
oligopoly, and warned that oil
interests had been permitted to buy
into control the country's coal
resources as well.

“The oil companies own the coal,
and they own the uranium. They
could do with coal what they're
doing right now with oil. We're
shipping coal out of the United
States.‘so someday we’ll be in the
same position we are in right now
with oil. _

‘‘I think what we need is to dust

said. “They got an inch here and
there and now they control from
source all the way to the consumer,
which means they can play around
with the figures.”

Dent said he advocated the
energy bill as passed recently by
the Congress and vetoed by the
President. .

“I can't see it as anything’except
the veto is to be used sparingly.
The Congress and the Senate are
the voice of the people. All of the
powers in that bill are available to
the President right now. Congress
felt that there should be a roll-back
in the price of crude oil.”

Dent criticized the conduct of the
Energy Office [FEO],
claiming there was no way for a
congressman to get answers to
immediate questions concerning

It would have .

allocations. “They are handling it
like a bunch of crapshooters,.and

Some plastics
firms are shutting down or
curtailing production for lack of raw
material. yet they tell us there are
boxcars loads just waiting some-
where. The growing suspicion is
that the shortages are artificial."

Dent related stories about
companies which were just about to
shut down for lack of raw material,
being offered all “they could
handle" at a price some four or ﬁve
times higher than those set by
Federal regulation.

According to Dent, one of the
major barriers to improved gov-
ernment credibility was the tradi-
tion of publicofficials spending
sums far above their salaries in
election campaigns.

“One of the sad reasons
Congress is in chains is that the
cost of running an election is so
high that either the candidate must
be wealthy himself, or they must
raise it by other means;

“We cannot be trusted by the
people when we spend three and
four times our salaries on cam-
paigns. I think election reform is

. extremely important, that is why

I’m not going to be stampeded on
the issue."

 

 

  Privacy, Reporter Says

BY LEE MARKOVITZ

The FBI keeps track of American
citizens who have unpopular
beliefs. according to Joseph Spear,
an investigative reporter for
columnist Jack Anderson.

Speaking in the Student Union

Tuesday night, Spear claimed he
has seen FBI intelligence files on
such people as football star Joe
Namath, former boxing champion
Joe Louis, movie actor Marlon
Brando, and I.F. Stone, a noted
investigative reporter. '

“Whenit comes to catching real
criminals, the FBI has no peer,”
Spear said‘. “But the FBI also
keeps records of many Americans
without regard to their rights of
privacy.

“During World War II, Presi-
dent Roosevelt gave (former FBI
Director) J. Edgar_ Hoover an
executive order to -keep track of
political subversives. But Hoover
expanded that authority and made
it a permanent thing so that today,
no one _who dares speak his mindis
safe from our friendly FBI agents,”
h_e said. I

Spear produced several FB_I
documents including one’ on a
famous movie actor containing only

. information that the actor- had

“homosexual tendencies.” “The
typical FBI file is filled with utter
trivia,” Spear said.

“Secrecy exists at all levels of
government but at the federal level
it has been institutionalized,”

Spear justified Jack Anderson’s
revelation that the US. despite its
statements of neutrality, was 1,‘,
actually supporting Pakistan in the ‘re’

“The tragedy of the Pentagon

The Environmental Action Club
(EAC) and the Dental Science Club
(DSC) were granted partial recog-

nition at_ the Student Government

Board (SGB) meeting Wednesday.
The Board had considered

making EAC a subcommittee of the
Public Interest Research Group
[PIRG] because they felt the two
groups might be similar in interest

areas and goals.

,,~,. Michelle De Jean, co-chairman

‘of the Committee on Student
Organizations (CSO), said, “PIRG
is so wide, so broad, and so
sparsely manned that they don’t

have the time or resources to work,
on any problems. There should be '

a group on this campus that is
willing to do something about it.
PIRG is concerned about the
problem, but doesn't do anything
about it.”

About 15 EAC members attended
the meeting. President Diane

Kearns and Vice-president Robert
Depner argued for EAC.

“We have over 70 active
members. PIRG has 10. It is
unfeasible for us to become a
subcommittee of them,” Kearns
said.

Depner listed ‘some "of the
differences between the two
groups. "PIRG has dues. They are
a charter member of a larger
organization. They have meetings
required. We have meetings, but
they're not required."

“PIRG is a political group."
Kearns added. “They‘ve taken
cases to court. We want to keep
away from the politics. We want to
get out and do something." She
also said EAC is involved in

_ clean-up programs. /I

no danger to any group over the

“We had to look at every

preliminary, and no one should

An estimate of the cost of

Draft

Ms Sexton:

The draft is indeed a serious
matter. It is because of this that I

have not and will not register. I am

a man; I will not be governed as a

petty cog in a machine!

The government may fine me if
they like; I have no assets
whatever. They may jail me; I am
young, my spirit is free.

I It cannot be denied that the
primary function of ‘the Armed
Forces is murder. Itiis a blind man
who claims to see any other
purpose, which is not better served
by another means. I cannot take it

, upon myself to injure those who

share this world of ours; they are
not enemies by my choice or theirs,
for someone else decided the
matter. I am accustomed to living
my, own life!

' Sincerely,

Terry Mclntyre

lncompetency

Dear Editor: .

In Tom Smith’s recent Pitt News
article, “SG: Operation Secrecy,"
a serious effort was made to
discredit the Student Government
Board. I think that effort was
totally unnecessary.

The Student Government Board

' has proven itself to be grossly
S ___,i3ng.on_3p7ete_nt without any help from V
?f;r'f1‘,‘-pi" Mr. Smith, the Pitt News, or any

other members of the human race.

I I sincerely believe that there is no

need for anyone, including
myself, to directly insult Student
Government at Pitt. Every time the
Furick Board makes a statement to

the free media they make idiots of /
‘f themselves anyway.

I'd like to focus the readers‘
attention a recent letter to the
editor of March 13 titled “SGB
reacts to Secrecy Charge." I

In paragraph one, the SGB
emphasizes its "policy," quote. to

‘ignore all editorial writing which

we know to be false and
inaccurate." Notice the word
“we." ‘

What is it with these self-right-
eous Board members, anyway? Do
they really believe that they have
golden asses that don’t deserve to
be kicked by us lowly students?

Who are they to decide what is
truth? What is relevant? What is
irrelevant? _

With the exception of Paul
Hcrtneky's letter of March 11,
every pro-board letter in the Pitt
News has been from the Board
itself. Shades of Hitler!

What's the matter, ladies and
gentlemen of the Board? Are
things so rough that you must now
polish your own golden asses?

As far as Hertnek_v's letter is
concerned, how can we as students
muster an ounce of respect for a
man who depends on the words
hell. damn, and bitch to make up
for serious deficiencies in his
pro-Board argument? If Hertneky
didn't agree with Tom Smith's
article. he should have presented
his attitudes in the same literate
and organized form that Mr. Smith
did.

Calling Tom Smith a “bitch"
doesn’t make his information false.

Coming back to the ,SG letter
(which could pass for the greatest
comedy of the century), I focus on
the fourth paragraph‘. '

  

Page 4—THE PITT NEWS—Friday, March 15, 1974

   e  t   e E d   .........................................................................................mm.um.nu..u.u...u.lI...Imumuummmnm-muInun.-m 

I have heard bullshit from all
levels of political bureaucrat, but
when SGB started to defend their
secret meetings, or “rap ses-
sions," on “Sunday mornings in
Church," I knew I had heard it all.

Oh great Board members, sent
from Above so that He can see over
us lowly students. Now we all
know that not only do the board
members think they have golden
asses, but they are pretentious
enough to throw in an attitude that
they are ‘holier than thou.’

If Mike Furick is God's repre-
sentative to Pitt, I‘m putting in an
application for early admission to
hell.

The SG letter goes on to pat the
Board on the back for “organizing
student support against the time
schedule fee." /*

Student Government Board did
not cause the uproar over the time
schedule fee, it was the fee itself
that caused the uproar. Three days
after the fee was withdrawn,

nobody gave a damn about Furick’s ‘

Heroes. Myself included.

The Board also attempts to take
credit for obtaining longer library
hours. This is called attempting to
kiss your own ass.

The longer library hours are also
a great victory for the Resident
Studetns Association, but do they
go out in the media and
congratulate themselves for it?

In conclusion, my advice to the
Board comes from Confusius, “A
man who attempts to kiss his own
ass is bound to fall over backwards
trying?’ ‘ I

I can't wait to hear the Board's
didactic and ambiguous reply to my
comments. They're bound to be
good for a few laughs.

Recognition

Dear Editor:

Here at Pitt a world class athlete
has received as little recognition as
seems possible from his own
school. A list of all his
achievements would fill this entire
page of the Pitt News.

Following are just a few of his
more outstanding achievements.
Recently he acquired his eighth
Eastern crown to tie him with
Marty Liquori for the most Eastern
crowns ever, and with the outdoor
season coming up, has a chance to
pass up Liquori to become the
all-time IC4A individual career
championship holder; he was an
alternate on the US Olympic team
to Munich in 1972; he finished first
in the trials for the World Games
that took him, as a member of the
US team, to the USSR last summer;
and he became an All-American
title-holder by taking second place
in the indoor NCAA track champ-
ionships in Detroit last weekend.

Presently at Pitt there are two
other All-Americans in Bill Knight
and Tony Dorsett. both great
athletes and both totally deserving
of the considerable attention they
have received in the Pitt News. But
with Bill Rea's All-American title
last week (his fourth All-American
title--3 NCAA's and l AAU) only
one paragraph at the end of an
article was devoted to him. Two
weeks ago when Rea won his

,.eighth Eastern title he got "a
’ headline story in the sports section

of the New York Times, but once
again only rateda paragraph..or two

  

in the Pitt News near the end of the
article. It seems that the flu bug
was a bigger news item than Rea's
fourth All-American title. Hope-
fully in the future you will give Bill
Rea more consideration in the Pitt
News as the truly great star that he
IS.

Nazism .

Dear Editor:

Two and a half weeks ago three
letters of complaint were sent out
to Charles Ralph, chairman of the
Biology Dept., Wesley Posvar
Chancellor and Robert Marshall.
Dean of CAS concerning the racist
textbook used in Bio 138-Man and
the Environment by Arthur
Boughey. As of yet we have
received no reply. Perhaps these
people think that if they ignore the
issue it will go away. Well, this
letter is to put the three of them on
notice.

The teaching" of Nazi ideas, under
the pretense of “freedom of
speech"(meaning freedom to teach
racism) is a very serious matter and
students on this campus will not
put up with any nonsense. ‘If no
reply is received by March 18th we
call on all students who want to see
this Nazi text thrown off campus ‘to
meet in Dr. Ralph's office on the
following Friday, at a time to be
announced- At ._such time we
expect Ralph to be ready with a
statement on what he is going to do
about the textbook. If he's not
ready. we're perfectly willi'ng to
wait there until he is. Racism
cannot be'ignored!

Cheap buildings offend me.

I use “cheap” in the sense of
“crappy.” To use a more familiar
example, most American cars are
certainly expensive A enough,‘ but
they are also most often poorly
built. Crappy, as it were.

And so it is with buildings, too.

‘The problem is’ that. as a Pitt

student, I've become more and
more surrounded by low-rate
structures. ‘ h‘

The recent problems with Bene-
dum Hall have provoked this
feeling. 4

A Pitt News story a week ago
reported rumors that the engineer-
ing building is sinking and sliding
due to a subsurface stream. The
story also mentioned use of inferior
materials by the contractor for the
project.

I’m no engineer, and certainly
don’t claim to be. But offhand I’d
say there’s a thing or two wrong
with that marvelously concrete
structure.

Just look at the buckled supports
around the plaza entrance to
Benedum--the closed~off doors
with the broken glass and the
cardboard sign that says, “Do Not
Use This Entrance Danger Above"
(sic). Sump pumps are handling
foundation drainage.

 But I-'ve'heard some things=about7~_-

;__ J...’

_’wall_s? ‘

  

Benedunr even before all
started to become general know-
ledge. One engineering student
told me about a sizeable crack in
the wall of one of the sixth floor
classrooms (I tried to check this one
out for myself but the room was in
use at the time).

Another Pitt student told of how,
when viewing Benedum. from
adjacent buildings, the corners
appeared to be very unsquare. I
definitely have not checked this one
out. but the source's.eyesi have
been pretty reliable in the past.

It’s ironic that the engineering

department would have to put up
with such a piece of garbage. Even
worse, though, it's sad.
. ' Sad that taxpayer’s money (via
the General State Authority) would
be spent on something so inferior.
Sad that such a multi-million dollar
investment would turn out below
par. - . '

And below par is certainly what I
consider Benedum.

Aesthetically it stinks. Cold,
white, and sterile best describes
the exterior. As for the interior,
well...

What can you say about walls
that are only painted cinder-block?
And did you know that Benedum
has no real baseboards around the

this I

 

Yes. The only “baseboard” is a
black painted stripe along the
lowest line of cinder-blocks. Other
cheap buildings at least use vinyl
strips. The Berlin Wall is fancier.

Whenyou look up at the hall
ceilings you get another treat: a

jumble of exposed ventilation

ductwork and electric conduits. I
assume that all this was toibe
hidden by drop ceilings--the light

‘fixtures are hung low enough to

accomodate them.

One description comes to mind:
half-baked.

I only wonder what all this means

in relation to all the other campus I

buildings--complete and incom-
plete. I'm not impressed by
anything the University has put up
in the past ten years. X

You name them--Hillman, Craw-
ford‘, David Lawrence, Trees Hall.
Some are worse than others, but all
are the angular caverns that have
come to characterize recent Pitt
architecture.

What's ahead? A bizarre LRDC
and a stark Chemistry Building.
And the Forbes Field complex.

The Atwood Street Beautiﬁcation
and Renovation Committee pre-
sented a pilot plan for Oakland
residential improvement to the
concerned and curious Wednesday
night at the SU Annex.

Property owners, tenants, stu-
dents and local merchants turned
out in support of the effort to alter
the appearance of the Atwood
Street area.

,;\Oakland coordinator of Model

Cities Dan Diven said “We're
focusing on Atwood to show what
can be done when residents band
together for constructive change.”

The project is “not political in any
way," Diven said, and the origin of
funds is still uncertain. He
expressed confidence ‘some sup-
plies and repair materials would be
donated to the program. “This is a
volunteer effort on the part of
concerned residents and busi-
nesses. Citizen motivation must be
the theme of this project or it will
fall flat.

“With all that’s said about
ggology, this is certainly something
young people might’ find inte-
resting. Hopefully, Pitt students
can be encouraged to lend a hand.”

Diven hopes to set a precedent for
similar face-lifts in other Pitts-
burgh communities.

Deal directly with the owner:

Phillip Wiener, Atwood business-
man and active voice in Oakland
community matters, then relayed a
letter from Bernard Kobosky. Pitt's
Vice Chancellor of Public Affairs,
in which Kobosky praised the
project's intentions and offered
University assistance.

Wiener noted the University has
much invested in Oakland, and
should be concerned. “Pitt owns
property on Atwood, but we’ve yet
to hear what they intend to do with
itxin terms of the project.”

He lamented what he sees as a
lack of communication among
administrative levels of the Univer-
sity. “We'll hear from one person
we have backing on something, and
then we hear that nobody there
knows anything _about it."

Wiener announced several propo-

sals the Renovation Committee had’

submitted to the city», including
15-minute parking meters in front
of the Post Office, and the
extension of Atwood’s one-way
pattern from the Forbes intersec-
tion to Fifth Avenue.

Billie Bramhall, from the City
Planners’ office, revealed the
potential for solid municipal
backing. She reported on plans for
repaving the well-traveled Atwood
sidewalks, which she admits “have
taken a beating for a long time."

Bramhall thinks Pitt expansion
has essentially ended. ‘‘I don’t

Jay Rollins. of Pitt Public

ment's willingness to make re-
sources available to the Atwood

interest can be generated.

Pitt student Al Porsche, an
Atwood Street tenant, thinks the
project is an excellent opportunity
for students to get involved with
their community, claiming it may
offer some relief from a perennial

problem. ‘
“Although I don't have this
trouble, some landlords charge

exorbitant rates for a really dingy
place. The community interest in
renovation might help imporve
these conditions. Let's face
it--right now, Atwood Street is
pretty grim."

type of urban renewal is a must.
“The central city is on the way
back. People don't want the
suburbs any more. So, it’s
important to be able to induce
young people to stay.”

He is determined absentee
landlords will not be excused from
the community effort. “Many
don’t care what the place looks

’ like--as long as it’s rented. They’ll

be niade, either by state or federal
legislation, to do something about
their property. I’|l introduce the
legislation myself.”

Romanelli plans to check into the
availability of federal or state funds
for the cleanup crusade. He also
suggested appealing to a founda-
tion, and then procuring a matched
amount from the State.

“Nothing but good can come of
this," Romanelli asserted. Interest
in your community is like cancer--it
spreads."

An exhibit of community reno-

vation schemes was held after the
meeting. One display advocated
do-it-yourself home repairs--paint

ing, caulking. Another boasted
potted plants, with how-to litera-
ture on ﬂower and vegetable
gardening.

A City of Pittsburgh forester
discussed plans to remedy the
conspicuous ‘lack of trees on
Atwood Street. Free galvanized
garbage cans were offered to
residents who, qualiﬁed with a
“litter free lawn.”

Many of the buildings on Atwood
are old and in need of extensive
repair. But the pitch of citizen
enthusiasm is high, and as Phillip

WDempster gave it an intense
performance. The piece utilizes
the extreme ranges of the‘

instrument, singing through the
instrument, extensive use of the
mute, and interjections of the
player's voice. The musical effects
were complemented with choreo-
graphy, mime and lighting.

In the Three Sketches for
Trombone and Piano by Andrew
Imbrie Dempster, accompanied by
Marvin‘.-Tartak displayed his
virtuosity in a more conventional
style as the piece ‘calls for no
extra-musical effects and few
avant-garde devices. .

One. very interesting effect was
achieved by the trombone playing a
loud, staccato note with the bell
directly over the strings of the
piano causing them to vibrate. The
Sketches are characterized by a
transparent texture and a free
ﬂowing sense of lyricism that never
seems contrived. V

Complementing Dempster's
performance were three pieces by
Pitt composers. Barry Nease’s
Anewditty for electronic tape was
the only electronic music on the
program. Anewditty contrasted
short, isolated segments of sound
with longer sections, the emphasis
being on the extreme ranges of
pitch and dynamics. and antiphonal
effects.

The piece was “performed" in

darkness and at a high level. Some
of the high frequency sounds were
so piercing that several people
were forced to leave the hall.
Thomas Janson’s Water Images
for soprano, ﬂute, piano, string trio
and percussion was a little
disappointing. Although Janson
achieved many interesting colors
and sonorities, the piece was rather
affected and dry. The performance
was enhanced by the inclusion of
several Pittsburgh Symphony play-

ters and by the marvelous singing of

Peggy Janson, for whom the piece
was composed. l
The program opened with Tomas

.Takaro's Suite Septem for five

percussionists. which isn't so

strange except that one of thr.-ﬁg’)!

percussionists was a cellist. The
the cello but for an occasional
melody, is treated in a purely
percussive manner with several
very interesting coloristic effects.
The piece isvin-seven move-
ments. each of which, according to
the composer, “is intended to be a
detailed look at some individual
aspect of non—pitched music." The
movements are entitled: “Beats,"
“Rhythms." “Dynamics." “Silen-
ces," "I-Iarmonics," “Divisions,"
and “Meters." The performance
started out slow but picked up
momentum as it went along with

the last three movements beingﬁx;

done especially well.

The Pitt Men's Glee Club will be -

in concert this Saturday evening,‘
March 16. The concert is
scheduled for 8:15 pm in Carnegie
Music Hall.

Also scheduled to perform with
the Glee Club are Elmira College

BY BILL ROSE

If you've ever imagined yourself
in a police line-up there's a chance
you'll get your opportunity.
Campus Police Sgt. Walt Waters
recently initiated a program in
which students, when approached

by the police, may volunteer for
duty in a line-up. '

“With the trend in recent years
toward non-involvement in criminal
matters by the public, the police

,2, have had to use suspects, in
' ’custody for other crimes, for
line-ups. In most cases these
suspects in no way match the
description of the suspect we are
trying to get an identification on.
“Students have been showing up
in line-ups downtown for some
time. But only recently have the
Pittsburgh police called on us for
assistance in supplying persons for
their line-ups on a fairly regular
basis."

Waters said the city police usually
calls the campus police and gives
a description of the suspect. His
department then has about two

/«hours in which to find volunteers
‘who match that description.

“The calls usually come in the
evening so we normally go down to
the Towers dorms to look for the
volunteers. There are, in most
cases, four or five persons in a
line-up. The city police ask for a
minimum of four, but they would
prefer five.” .

According to Waters, most people

line-up. “Looking from a cop's
angle," Waters said. “you're
looking for a conviction. The laws
regarding identification of a sus-
pect protect both the suspect and
the victim. so it's vital that the
victim be able to make a positive
identification easily. Without it we
don't have a case.

"Once the crime is committed and
the criminal has tied the scene, the
victim is not permitted to see any
suspect taken into custody until the
line-up. We have been matching
descriptions so carefully that the
victims have had a very hard time
identifying the criminal."

There is no way students can
volunteer for the line-ups. Says

av

Waters. "We're not recruiting as
such. We just want to thank those
who have volunteered for the
public service they performed.
Hopefully. this will encourage
others, to do the same if we ever
have need for them."

‘We drive the volunteers down-
town and back so in most cases
there’s really no problem. But
when we encounter a case where
our department is using the line-up
we have a difficult time keeping the
victim separated from the volun-
teers. Of course, there’s always
the chance the victim is also a
student and knows one or more of
the men in the lineup.” Waters
explained. “In cases involving the

Greeks to Fight Muscular Dystrophy ,

BY LARRY PANSINO

The social fraternity and sorority
system will stage its annual Greek
Week Friday March 15 through
Saturday March 23. The emphasis
this year will be on a charity drive

against muscular dystrophy.
Bruce Weinberg, Greek Week
chairman, predicts that “some-
where near $15,000 if not more”
will be collected by the organiza-
tions participating. The charity
campaign was kicked-off six weeks
ago with the mock-kidnapping of
football head coach Johnny Majors

and Allegheny County Sheriff-

Eugene Coon for “ransom.”
Besides soliciting donations from

pedestrians on the streets of
Pittsburgh and nearby. commu-
nities, the individual groups held
stunts like walkathons and hoagie
sale to raise money. The Greek
Week committee says, “This
year's charity drive is expected to
be the best ever.”
Awards to the fraternity and
sorority collecting the most money
will be made by the local poster boy
for muscular dystrophy, Eddie
Eger. during intermission of Greek
Sing, the night of Wednesday
’March 20 at Carnegie Music Hall.

The theme of Greek Week ’74. is
“It’s A Small World.” The
schedule of events gets under way

this afternoon with a banner
display in the Towers Lobby. On
Monday, the Greeks will display
their chariots "on Bigelow Boule-
vard between the Cathedral and
the Student Union before partici-
pating in a scavenger hunt and
“Fun Night”.
Talent night, a

program of

musical and comedy acts, will be at ,

Synod Hall this year on Tuesday
night. Greek Sing the following
night is a show in which each
fraternity and sorority represented
by 15 or 20 of its members
performs a few songs.

. Directions is

edition of the New Directions
series, this volume of poetry and

prose draws on writers from five -

nations-and will be published by
mid-March.

As a writing professor here at
Pitt warned this writer. New
prone to weird
writing. A brain neuron says its
piece in‘ “Brain Cell
9,999,999,999" by Paul West.
Jewish perception is catalogued in
“A Book of Histories", lists of
disconnected prose by ethnopoet
Jerome Rothenberg.

And “Four Pieces” is just what
the title implies--four unrelated
sketches by Faye, Sobkowsky: an
unimposing mama’s boy who
cannot mourn his dead father, but
compares him to a mentally
incapacitated friedn who very well
might he himself; the death of
Rosa, the sexual object; the death
of a German family; and a young
woman entering puberty who

cannot cope with her potential-

* sexuality.

-A-,

The list goes on. From the
highly imaginative accounts of
those obsessed with fears of
perversions to fearfully perverted
accounts. “Growth" by Frederick
Busch falls into the first category.

-.

. 3Pa‘ge«8---THE Plifr NEws—ii«'*rida3¥,iMai}Ehis,f:1si74' s T A I

tDirecfions Publishes Writers From 5 Nations

The portagonist of this account is a

newly-married, man. plagued by

guilt complex-es, feelings of inade-
quacies and fears of the abnormal.

The theme of growth is simply
the man's interpretation of growth;
that growth must take place in the
commonly accepted patterns. Job
advancement, personal.enrichment
and family enlargement.

The conflict of the story is the
wire’s gynecological problem, not
revealed or known until the ﬁnal
passages of the narrative. This is
the arena in which the fears of
perversion perform; questions of
sex frequency from a counsellor,
necessity ofproducing a sperm
sample for potency tests and the
fear of breast cancer deforming his
wife.

Busch's techniques for illus-
trating these obsessions are pol-
ished and crafty. The entire
narrative is a series of flashbacks.

remembered from a hospital
waiting room. The flashbacks
occur chronologically, seemingly

the simplist way of following the
wife's progression in the diagnosis
of her medical ills. and the
husband's fear of them. But the

way Busch begins the flashbackingf

is purely associational, and, at
points. metaphorical.

The protagonist sees symbols in
the smoke from his pipe tobacco
and begins the autobiography with
the purchase of the pipe. The
entire backward time motion is so

smooth that the reader does not
notice a point where “now” ends
and "then" begins. Thus, the
story flows to its end where the
pipe cools. and the woman finishes
surgery.

“Wedding Finger" by James
Purdy would fall into the area of the
fearfully perverted account. The
play itself would be acclaimed by
the Theater of the Absurd, but I
find the characterization perverted.
The dialogue. setting and thrust of
Purdy's work are entertaining in a
absurd way, but the characters
seem to be deranged projections of
stale faces. The initial narrator,
Saint-Stephen is an Emporer Jones
in whitewash, with the inevitable
servant, Cato, at his side. But,

where Jones came off as power-'

grappling and paranoid, the “Saint
is sly:

SPECTATOR. This be no bona
tide Saint-Stephan, the proto-mar-
tyr. This be the notorious gambler,
hashish-sucker Tim Luter, of
Cowick. Kentucky,, who earns his
keep by selling young men into
white slavery on coffee boats,

never to be heard of again by their ,

friends or family. Listen to any
Missing Persons Bureau broadcast
on your radio hour. ’

“SAINT-STEPHAN. And which
of those men you claim I sold into
the coffee boats ever so much as
sent back one post card of
complaint concerning their voyage
to Rio?”

And the good Saint, alias Tim
Luter, alias the despaired lonely
New Yorker, continues to humble
the spectator to the point of
embarrassing him before the
audience for being jealous of the
men sold to Rio. And the spectator
exits, but not before thoroughly
kissing the feet of the Saint. the
Emporer Jones of the Absurd.

This character, who is sad and
complaining. on page one, and
deﬁantly bold throughout, contin-
ues to bring characters on stage
during the rest of the play.

The play is terriﬁcally entertain-
ing, but I must confess the feeling
that the author intended signifi-
cance in the Saint that Ijust can't
find. As with much drama, it
looses in the written translation.
Or. as Dr. Favorini of Pitt's Theater
Arts Department would say, “A
play is not basically a work of
literature. but a work in the
dramaticmode, whose form and
function are different from litera-
ture." _ M

New Directions 28_threads prose
with poetry throughout its one
hundred and eighty page crazed
course. “Kayanerenhkowa” is an
excerpt from an epic by Ernesto
Cardenal of Nicaragua. The epic,
“Homage to the American Indi-
ans” is a migration of species and
peoples through Tony Curtis
movies, the Pax Iroquia, the
Leagure of Nations and inevitable
wars.

The flow and phrase structure of
Cardenal's excerpt is strenuous to
follow at times. But the mood and
thoughts of this “revolutionary
priest" are exceptional.

The symbolism here is inthe
Indian-stereotypic dialogue of bird
migrations and the seasons they
represent. Cardenal’s season for
these steel birds is the eternal
season, threaded throughout the
poem. The planes can only
represent Third World oppression. 
And Cardenal sets the scene for thew‘
flight of the bombers with these
words:

“If you are sad as I am now

I will comfort you with my

wampum, _
or with my old Underwood.
With shells. With these

typewriter keys...

It is the time of the wading birds
in Solentiname,

And that of the sad bird that
sings fucked up

The last Cormorant is gone.

And the lights on

at the UN?”

New Directions 28 is not justgg,

_another literary magazine of’.

writers from academe conversing
with each other. It’s joyous in its
weird crazes, mystical I in its
morbidity and realer-than-real with
its obsessions. It is a volume to be
read lightly, and at times to be
taken quite seriously in its
pessimistic travels. It's different
and it’s rare--and enjoyable.

Orleans At The Annex   

The Student Union Annex on
Bouquet Street is exploding this
weekend with two acts. Madeline
Brown makes a return trip. And a
group called Orleans debuts.

Orleans is a quartet from
Woodstock, New York with a
simple secret for success: good,
solid professional musicianship.
Each member began training for
his career before he learned to read
and write. Take this extensive
background and facility, temper in
the fires of continuous gigging and
the result is music to move both

~ body and mind.

The group was founded in
February of 1972 when guitarist
John Hall and drummer Wells
Kelly called Larry Hoppen to
replace a departing bass player.

Larry was playing lead guitar with
Boffalongo [the band Wells had
quit to rejoin John after a two-year
separation], but being equally at
home on the bass, he left the quiet
hills of Ithaca for the music mecca
of Woodstock.

Hard work laid a tight foundation
and garnered a stack of rave
reviews. But ‘Orleans had a
problem. To fully realize the
potential of the music they needed
a fourth member. Search as they
might, there wasn’t anyone who
didn't severely limit their prized
creativity in one way or another.

Like many quests, the answer
turned out to be their

backyard. In June of ’72, Larry's
younger brother, Lance graduated

own‘

from high school as valedictorian
and began playing bass full-time
with a local Long Island group.
Orleans turned to Lance in
October.

It took only three months to work
out the. transition from trio to

-quartet and then Orleans judged

that the time was right. Indeed it
was. Two months of showcasing at
the Mercer Arts Center in New
York City netted them an array of
recording offers. The Village Voice
wrote: “Orleans comes through
real, earthy. Clean. It’s the
tightest band I’ve seen in a long
time. The house was jumping,
dancing in the aisles. The rocking
atmosphere reminded me of some
finer 4 am Fillmore moments.”

Two Pitt freshmen participated

   

in the Programs last summer.

Robert Sambroak and Terrance
Melntyre. in the College of Arts
and Sciences. worked in the

outskirts of Barbourville,_Ky. for a

week last August.
Sambroak reflected, “The vol-
unteers were divided into different

work groups, each headed by a »

leader. I worked mostly on houses
back in the ‘holler’, as they say
down there. These are houses
isolated in the hills and mountains.
At first, it didn't look like the
people were poor, but just lived on
an ‘old MacDonald’s farm.’

“We tar-papered the home of a
family of nine children. The father
was disabled. On the first day.
they gave us a feast from food they
had grown themselves. We didn't

 

want to take any because we knew
that it meant they would go without
later on--they close to starve in the
winter--but we were told not to turn
it down because it would upset
them. On the second day though.
the amount of food had dwindled
and l was really hungry."

Sambroak said he was impressed
with “how really friendly" the
people were, but he was disgusted
with the town's people in Barbour-
ville. maintaining they don't care
about the poor.

“The Barbourville area is the
complete opposite of Pittsburgh.
Down there the inner city is well-off
and it gets worse as you go out.

“The people of Barbourville built
a wall around the town to protect
them against ﬂooding caused by a

‘Poverty exists 500 yards away,”’
Sambroak noted.

Melntyre added. “The people in
Appalachia aren't being fed prop-
erly. They eat nothing but
vegetables--no meat. It's very
different here. People don't know
how good they have it."

Both are returning to Knox
County this summer. Melntyre
concluded, “We did a lot of good
for the people we helped. and they
were grateful. but there are still a
lot more who need helped.”

Soap Box Engineering

BY RALPH HAURWIT Z
Ed. Note: Soap’ Box Derby was one
of the exciting features of
Engineers Week 1974. Some other
interesting things popped up too.

“Will everyone please stand,

back?" shrieked the announcer.

Several hundred heads lined
along Lytton Ave. craned forward
as the molded blue fiberglass derby
racer pushed off and began rolling
down the hill, through Center Ave.
It zipped past the review stand,
across the ﬁnish line, and jerked to
a stop in front of the Syria Mosque.

With a best time of 19.2 seconds,
Rick Patrick of the Civil Engineer-
ing Department, and his strong-
armed pusher, Dave Plank, walked
off $100 richer and very happy.
They were winners _of the annual
Soap Box Derby, which took place
yesterday afternoon as part of
Engineers’ Week.

“The secret is the brakes and the
pusher." Patrick explained. “My
brakes consist of tire treads
mounted on a platform underneath
the car. When I hit the brakes, the
platform hits the ground, lifts the
whole car up in the air. and I stop.

' time. ‘

   

That way. I can wait until I'm
across the finish line before
applying the brakes, gaining extra
tenths of a second."

The allowed braking distance

after the run is about 20 feet. Over.

that. one penalty point (one full

' second) is added to the elapsed
Another ten feet adds

another penalty point, and so on.
Thus, a good braking system is
crucial to a stop which is both late
and quick.

Plank explained his pushing
technique: “I didn’t see anyone

   

else pushing this way, but this is
how I do it. I start out with one foot
forward, and after the run and
push, I end up the same way. I try
to give a powerful lunge at the end.

Usually, I ended-up flat on the
ground.”

Plank's scraped and torn pants
and sweatshirt were proof of the
extra effort. ,

BY RON SIEGEL

n RALEIGH. N.C.--Returning
To: the form that spurned its 22
ame winning streak, the Pitt
;basketball team,_ led by Billy
‘night's 34 points. fought to an
if 78 victory over Furman at
eynolds Coliseum last night.
‘The Panthers will meet top-
‘ranked North Carolina State, 92-76
.. inners over Providence, at 2:10
Saturday afternoon for the Eastern
Championship and the right to go
n'to Greensboro next week for the
CAA national crown. ,_

It was a Knight for everybody to
emember as Billy Knight snapped
ut of his late season slump,
Zsinking 12 of 20 shots from the floor
';a_nd.lO of ll free throws for his
game high total of 34.
“Mooney” knew he was back to
iformaalmost at the outset of the
jgame. “My first shot was blocked
}[by 7-1 Fessor Leonard], but I knew
' was going in. I started shooting
ke I did before I was injured.”

 

:It seems, hard to believe that in
‘only one year Pitt athletics has
fimoved from boring mediocrity to
one of the most exciting programs
}in_ the country. The football
program did a complete turnaround
last season and is slowly working
sway back to the top of the heap.
itt's surprising basketball team is
.*'putting the ﬁnishing touches on
,possibly the best season in the
history of the school‘. The track and
wim teams have become much
grnore competitive and are begin-
-‘ning to rate as Eastern powers.
;And then there's the wrestling
‘team. I

Unfortunately. Pitt's mat team
.. as notibeen able to keep up with
:'_the other varsity squads., The
'program'continues to be only
‘marginal and this year's 5-12
‘record leaves much to be desired.
The big question is just who is
‘responsible for this wrestling
"yﬁasco.

The most logical place to start
would be with‘ the coaches. Head
_‘coach Dave Adams assumed the
:‘=P,itt wrestling job in May of 1967.
. Iii his six years at the helm he has
9s_ted_._ gt dual meet ‘record of
~f4”5-443-if ':'In his very ﬁrst season at
1 Pitt, . Adams was named Rookie-
Coach-of-the-Year by the Amateur
'8-Wrestling News--the bible of the
__ -wrestling world. But since that
 Htime, Adams has not really
‘ impressed anyone with his teams.
 Back in 1967 when the Athletic
 Department was shopping around
 v for a new head man. they made it
_  known that there were two leading
8 ‘candidates for thejob. Adams was
eventually awarded the position on
the strength of his 21-1 record as
. coach of the Plebe wrestling team
I ‘at the Naval Academy. The other
1 candidate was young Bob Bubb
 who currently coaches at Clarion
_ » State College where his out-
" » standing squad has been breaking
records. So, it appears that the Pitt
officials may have made a wrong
choice.
Every year. there seems to be one
or two Panthers who excel‘ at
wrestling while the rest of the team

A Bad Choice!’

BY G. W. STEVENS

Winning Coach Buzz Ridl cred-
ited Pitt's defense with keeping‘th.e
ball away from Furman’s big men,
and cited this as a major factor in
the victory. “I'm elated about this
win," he added.

Pitt had built up a 38-34 halftime
lead. but it soon evaporated as the
Paladin’s Bruce Grimm kept
popping. At one point Pitt trailed
by 6. 54-48, but the Cats fought
back.

Knight began an eight point
scoring binge, and when it ended,
the score was tied, 58-58‘.

Furman worked the lead back up
to ‘ﬁve again but the Panthers
continued playing their own game,
and Mickey Martin's jumper at
6:32 gave Pitt a 68-67 lead.

Knight then missed on a 1-and-1.
but a Furman foul by Leonard gave
Pitt the ball again,-and Martin hit
again to give Pitt a three point
advantage.

The Paladins fought back to tie
the score at 72 after Leonard

llllllllllllllllllllllllllIIIIIIIF

struggles to post winning records.
George Bryant and Rande Stottle-
myer are the only two bright spots
for the Panthers this year, and
Craig Tritch was Pitt's lone star
last year. Adams hasn't been able
to attract many ﬁrst-class recruits
and has been forced to limit his
recruiting to the Western Pennsyl-
vania area. Over the years, he has
lost many of the leading prospects
to the winning programs of Penn
Stateand Lehigh, as well as Clarion
State.

But all the blame can't be directed
against only Dave Adams. His
losing program has not been able to
generate any revenue and money is
the key to the problem. The
Athletic Department must ﬁrst
make a serious commitment it
wrestling or the program vgl
continue to be trapped /in s
present vicious circle. But ‘the
department is just now beginning
to get out of the red and all the
programs. especially intramurals,
are screaming for increases in their
budgets. 4

Adams insists, and his opposing
coaches agree, that the latest Pitt
schedule was possibly the toughest
in the East. The teams ﬁfth place
finish in this lyea’r*§""rEiw‘A
tournament was somewhat impres-
sive but the real success of this
season will be determined by the
showings of Bryant, Stottlemyer,
and Ron Selfridge in this weekends
NCAA championships. An NCAA
title would turn a dull, uninterest-
ing season into a success.

Despite the evidence against him.
Adams remains as one of the most
knowledgable coaches in the major
college ranks. The Athletic
Department did not make a mistake
back in I967, perhaps the mistake
was Adam's in even accepting the
job. To even consider replacing
‘him would be a serious injustice.
He has the talent to turn his young
inexperienced squad into a formi-
dable threat and a winning season
next year would not be too
surprising. Pitt wrestling fans will

just have to be patient because it is ‘

doubtful that another coach could
do any better.

  Skaters Clinchi

BY BART MACK

After playing second ﬁddle to
Carnegie-Mellon all year long, the
Pitt Hockey Club put the cap on its
regular season Tuesdaynight by
blanking Penn State (McKeesport),
5-0. to ﬁnish in sole possession of
ﬁrst place of the Western Pennsyl-
vania Intercollegiate Hockey Asso-
ciation‘. ‘

The Panther skaters are now set
to face Indiana in the first round of
the playoffs. which will be held
March 19 at the Sewickley Arena.
Second place C-MU will battle the
fourth place ﬁnisher, either Du-
quesne or St. Vincent.

The shutout over PSU marked
another ﬁne performance -by Pitt
goaltender .Iumpin' John DeFazio,
his second in a row. First line
center Charly Hagins powered the
offense with the three goal hat trick
while Joe Grucncr and Russ Stump
each tallied one.

It was against Penn State
[McKeesport] in the opening game
of the season that a brutal fight
erupted, and in the pair of
succeeding contests between Pitt

and PSU tempers were hot. Late in
the third period of Tuesday night’s
clash, a skirmish broke out that
inight be costly to Pitt in the
upcoming playoffs.

Pitt’s Denny Browne and Charly
Hagins were involved in the mixup
and were handed a ﬁve minute
ﬁghting majors, which, under the

* WPIHA rules enacted in January,

also carried a game misconduct and
a suspension for the next game.

That means that if the fighting
penalties stand. both Browne and
Hagins will not be in uniform for
the first game of the playoffs. The
actual ﬁve minute call is being
protested by Pitt on the grounds
that no punches were thrown in the
incident.

Fourth place is still up for grabs,
although the Duquesne Dukes have
to be the favorites to notch that
ﬁnal playoff spot. St. Vincent and
Duquesne scrapped to a 3-3 tie
Wednesday on the Vinnies home
ice and will meet again on March
17 in the WPIHA season finale.
The Dukes need only tie St. Vincent
for the right to face Carnegie-Mel-

that Pitt took its lead.

First

Ion. That game will also be played
at Kirk Nevin Arena.

For Pitt, clinching ﬁrst place was
long awaited as the Pantherskaters
had to keep up with Carnegie-Mel-
lon after losing to the Tartans in
December to relinquish the top
spot. The season's schedule
favored C-MU in that Pitt always
trailed in games played forcing the
Panthers to match the Tartans win
for win. A 4-4 tie was the result of
the second Pitt-C-MU meeting but
the Panthers came on strong to
trounce the Tartans, 6-1. in their
final regular season contest.

Carnegie-Mellon suffered a tie at
the hands of Indiana just prior to
that third game against Pitt, thus
enabling the Panthers to put a ﬁnal
claim on first place by just a single
point. "

Even if Pitt and C-MU would
have ﬁnished the regular season
with identical slates, the Panthers

would have inherited the top spot

by total goals scored on the season.

A Pitt-Carnegie-Mellon matchup
in the championship game is
expected.

on Leaks right knee Thursday.

Leaks suffered ligament tears in

noon. Royal said films showed
Leak’s right foot was not planted
but was in the air when he was hit
by defensive back Sammy Mason
and another Longhorn.

The Longhorn dressing room was
somber after practice, as Texas’
chances of winning a seventh
Southwest Conference champion-
ship decreased markedly with the
absence of the 5-foot-11, 220-
pounder.

“It looks like that's pretty well it I

“We have received no encour-

“I really feel sorry for Roosevelt.

    Buc Slugger Keeping Cool

Bradenton. Fla. AP--

Willie Stargell last season led the
major leagues in home runs, RBI,
doubles and slugging percentage.
and was runnerup in the National

League Most Valuable Player"

balloting.

What does the slugger of the
Pittsburgh Pirates plan for an
encore?

“People ask that and I really can’t
answer it,” said Stargell at the
Pirates’ training camp here.

“The only thing I can do is what
I’ve done in previous years. just go

out and prepare myself the best.

way I can from a mental and
physical standpoint. stay healthy
and see what happens."

This is Stargell's 13th year since
the Pirates brought him up at the
end of the 1962 season. At one
time or another he's led the league
in most slugging categories, played
on a world championship team, and

final six minutes of the first half
that chopped Michigan's margin at
intermission to 34-29.

The Irish, with Shumate scoring
most of the points with his inside
maneuvers, finally got even again
with 10:15 left in the game when
Shumate stole a pass and dribbled
three-fourths the length of the floor
to sink a layup.

Twenty seconds later, Shumate
gave Gary Novak a perfect pass for
a layup that gave the Irish a 54-52
lead.

Notre Dame led only once
thereafter, at 56-54, before Russell
sank a 20-footer to tie it and then
hit a fast-break layup that put
Michigan ahead for good at 58-56
with 8:07 remaining.

when Ten Weubben was called for
an offensive foul.

Kansas held onto the ball for the

Creighton saw an early second-

the Bluejays enjoyed during the
game, evaporate with 4:05f left

six times been an All-Star team
member. What then is left for the
big fellow to accomplish?

“I don’t see myself in terms of
trying to accomplish things,”
Stargell said. “Anytime you
anticipate..., you have a chance of
being very disappointed in some-
thing. Ijust think that if you’re
healthy and given an opportunity
to play, then things that you are
capable of doing you wait until that
time to see.

“I never try and plan any one
particular thing, like hitting 70
home runs a year, things of this
nature. I’m just a different brand
of ball player. I guess you might
say. I don't play to please people.
Ijust play to please myself. I never,
set out to try and prove anything."

Stargell attributes his excellent
1973 season to playing"on strong
legs for the first time in several
years. He's had some knee
problems, and that was taken care
of in the winter of 1973. He also
believes a take-what-may-come
attitude has helped him keep a
good mental outlook.

“When things aren’t going
good,” he says, “I never break. I
may bend, but I never break, and
that gives men an opportunity to

come back the next day very
refreshed and with the same
attitude throughout the season.”

Stargell insists that despite some
reports to the contrary, he wasn't
mad about losing the 1973 MVP
award to Cincinnati's Pete Rose.

“As I told people when it
happened," Stargell said, “I can't
get disappointed about something
that l have no knowledge about.
No one has come out and said how
the MVP is chosen. And I never
prepare myself from the time I
come to spring training to get in the
frame of mind of winning the Most
Valuable Player award.

“In 1971 he hit .295 with 48
homers and 125 RBI it did upset
me. I was disappointed. I think at
that time I vowed never to get in
that frame of mind ever again.”

Stargell plans again to play the
whole season in left field. There is
no thought in the Pittsburgh camp
of moving him to first base, a
possibility that was entertained last
spring almost up to the opening
day of the season.

The 33-year-old Stargell says
deciding to play left field was a
wise decision. He felt that the brief
1973 spring training period wasn't
long enough to master first base.

Bruins Give Sanderson
  OK For Negotiations

BOSTON AP--The Boston
Bruins have given suspended
center Derek Sanderson permission
to begin talks with other teams in
the National Hockey League,
Sanderson’s attorney, Bob Woolf,
said Thursday.

Woolf announced the agreement
after an hour and a half meeting
with Bruins President Weston
Adams Jr. and General Manager
Harry Sinden.

Sanderson was suspended Mon-
day for the remainder of the
season, including playoffs, after he
missed the team plane returning
from Oakland Sunday night. His

decision to stay on the West Coast
came after a dressing room fight
with winger Terry O’Reilly.
_ Woolf said the Bruins agreed to
fine Sanderson only for missing the
plane. The fine is $1,000.

Another meeting between Woolf
and thel,Bruins management is to
be held in a week to 10 days, the
attorney said, after he has had a
chance to shop around the league
for a, possible spot for the
flamboyant center.

Woolf noted that although the

trading deadline was March 10,
trades could be made as long as the
player doesn't playyfor his new
team this season.
