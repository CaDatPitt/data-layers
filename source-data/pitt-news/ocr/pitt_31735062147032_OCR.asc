College Students
. Will Investigate
City Conditions

Unemployed college students this
summer may turn the time to some
value by joining in the annual YM-
YWCA summer Inquiry session meet-
ing. June 2-5 to July 27- inclusive.

Personal contact with the current
industrial and social problems of our
urban life and surrounding industrial.

centers will bepossible during this,

Inquiry. The work will be _conducted
along different‘ lines this summer

than last year to give the students a
more personal contact with existing
conditions than was possible under
the former plan. However; trips to
industrial centers, such as steel mills,
coal mines, box and cork factories,
and weekly forums to discuss and
analyze the problems which students
come upon will be retained. '
‘ Frank Skalak, head of the Brashear
settlement, will direct the ﬁeld work
of the students. It is Mr. Skalak’s
plan to put eachstudent at the head
of a group of young children and
make a case history of the children
in the group. This case history will
necessiate tripss to the childresn’s
homes, discussion with their parents,
stud-3.! of neighborhood conditions,
and various other forces that will af-
fect their character. This case work
will be under the direction of an ex-
perienced -social worker who will in-
struct the students in the proper
forms of building up cases. ,
Students interested in this work
must sign up at the YMCA hut with
W'_ VV. ‘lendenhall, executive secre-
tary of the YMCA, or at the YVVCA
with Miss Helen Battrick, executive
secretary of the YWCA. Miss Cath-

Drive Nears Climax

 

Bulletin

The combined financial report of
the “Complete the Cathedral” cam-
paigners yesterday was $29100
bringing the grand total to $470,-
GOO. The meeting took place in
the William Penn hotel.

By Bernard Fleming

‘With the close of the “Complete the
Cathedral” drive coming near, friends
of the University are urged to put all
their energy behind their efforts in
gaining subscriptions for the cam-
paign fund.

Successful closing of this campaign
f01“ $1,650,000 will enable University
oflicials to complete the lower twenty
ﬂoors of the tall building and to house
the majority of the student classes,
and to rough ﬁnish the upper twenty
ﬂoors.

It is practically necessary to com-
Dlete the campaign now for it will not
only aid the unemployment problem
now but wi'l, when ﬁnished, add
greatly to the civic prestige of the
city.

This is the ﬁrst appeal to the public
for additional funds for the Cathedral
since the ﬁrst drive in 1925 and prob-
ably will be the last one.

At yesterday’s meeting the Primary
gifts committee under A. E. Braun
reported a total of $11,100 and the
Corporations committee under J. C.
Trees reported a total of $10,000. The
other contributions came from indi-
viduals in the Citizens’ committee un-
der Thomas Fitzgerald.

Sigma Delta Chi
Edits This Issue

,The boys were sitting around
News office waiting for a Sigma.
Delta Chi meeting to begin. Ellis
Tumpson, business manager for next
year remarked, innocently enough,
that he had enough advertise-
ments to print another edition of the
News. Like a ﬂash Mr. Johnny
Paulus suggested that Sigma Delta
Chi, national professional journalism
fraternity, put out a tabloid issue;
like another ﬂash he was taken up
and that’s how this issue was born.
Thus the wheels of progress began
and the presses started to grind.

VVe want you to know that the-
changing around of the columnists
was intentional and not due to the
laxity of the boys down at VVestern
Newspaper Union.

The entire paper was written, copy-
read, and edited by the members, and
in the record time :of exactly one
hour and fifteen minutes. So dear
readers, please excuse all the gram-
matical errors that we may have
made.

Fred Edwards, C36,. newly elected
president of Druids, made the follow-
ing statement to a News reporter yes-
terday: “We are planning to make
Druids the outstanding honorary fra-
ternity on the University campus.”

Asked about the accusations made
this year the Druids are a political
organization, Edward answered, “Pol-
itics will positively be submerged be-
neath the best interests of the Uni-
and you can put that in
italics!”

Cathedral Campaign

\V'ith yesterday's luncheon of

workers in the \Villiam Penn
hotel, the Cathedral campaign
for funds to finish the forty-

two story building get fully
under way. Supported by stu-
dents, faculty, and the citi-
zens of the community as a whole,
the campaign to ﬁnish the build-
ing is a laudable move in the di-
rection of the greater welfare of
I’ittsburgl1’s cultural life.

Students of the University who
are naturally interested in the
Complete the Cathedral campaign
can do much for the University
by showing their enthusiasm and
their knowledge of the problems
of the school to friends, relatives,
and associates on the outside. ‘V9
feel that no greater cause has ever
challenged a student body and we
feel that the Pitt student body is
equal to its task. _

The activity of undergraduate
students of the University in con-
ducting visitors through the
building and in other services to
the campaign has been notable in
its revelation that the student
body of the school is interested in
the completion of the building.
The entire undergraduate forces
of the University are centered on
the campaign. It is bound to go
over.

Ten thousand three hundred
visitors have been conducted
through the Cathedral since last
Sunday. Twenty-seven hundred
persons were shown through the
building Sunday alone. All the
guides were members of the un-
dergraduate student body of the
University. Student interest runs
high in the Complete the Cathe-
dral campaign.

“By the decision of the university
council, students of Columbia Uni-
"91’SitY are again allowed to play in-
tercollegiate football under certain
restrictions. Football was abolished
in 1905.”

“The conditions under which the
sport is restored provides that no
freshman or graduate students are
to participate, that all games are to
-be played on college grounds and on
Saturdays and holidays and that
games for the present are not to be
played with Princeton, Harva'rd,

The last issue of the Pittsburgh

General Alumni association, for this
term will be mailed out this week.

The publication, the editor of which
is Don F. Saunders, features articles
written by Dr. Harold G, Moulton,
head of the Brookings institute;
Dr. John G. Bowman, chancellor of
the University; Miss Ruth Crawford

Mitchell, advisor to the Nationality
room committees; and Miss Doris
Shaver, assistant to Mr. Saunders.

These articles cover a discussion of
the historical precedent for the cur-
rent trend toward governmental con-
trol of business; the story of the Ca-
thedral of Learning and its meaning;
the tale of Miss Cathe-r’s meeting
with Ethelbert Nevin and a descrip-
tion of the proposed Nevin memorial
rooms. The editor discusses in Mat-
ters of Record phases of the present
“Complete the Cathedral” drive, and

"Miss Shaver in News of the Univer-

sity gives a general summary of the
various activities and personalities
connected with the University and
Alumni.

The pictorial record gives the alum-
ni and friends of the University a
view of the various presidents of Pitt
clubs, and constituent organizations;

additions at the last minute held its
publication up.

“When the ﬁnal whistle trills out
the ending of the Margaret Morrison
game tomorrow evening the closing
note of the ﬁrst and singularly suc-
cessful season of the Pitt basketball
girls will be sounded.”

 

“Pitt is the ﬁrst school in this
country, as far as can be learned
that is offering a. chemistry co11rse
in “Laboratory Equipment and Sup-
plies.” During this term Director
Silverman is giving the course for
the ﬁrst time. The course is required
of all Seniors in Chemistry and will
enable graduates to equip laborator-
ies properly.”

May 20, in Schenley Park, is the date
and place of the ﬁrst annual picnic
of the college, Although the park
does not open until May 30, a special

Sportorial

By Wilbur D. Clark
Explanation: The very good friend,
ﬁery-haired sports writer Badger in-
sists that he is going literary this
time and so has established himself
in my customary place under “Be-

tween You, Me, And The Lamp Post.”
(Mrs. Badger, you will ﬁnd your son’s
tripe elsewhere in this paper.) I
have little choice, and so must write
under this head, “Sportorial,” what-
ever that means.

In the last issue, which was to have
been the last issue. I neglected to
write a. “farewell” column. Since, I
have not slept well. I wrote about
the hound dog who plagued the place
in the last column, and gave my phone
number in the hopes that some good
humanitarian would call up and prove
willing to take the mut. Eddie Banks
asked for the old pants that the dog
was sleeping on. Otherwise the col-
umn was without results.

But to get back to the “farewell
column” idea. I did want to thank
all my dear, dear readers for reading
this stuff during the past year. I have
tried to say nothing that would offend
either the Alphas or the Betas. In
that, I am sure, I have succeeded.

In farewell I wish to remark on the
beauty of a slim, blonde Junior who
has haunted my dreams for two years.
Last year we both sat in Psychology,
she in the last row and me in the bal-
cony. and while the good professor
talked of inhibitions I wished that I
might speak to her. Passing her on
the campus has been torture. Not
once—yes only once—I have spoken
to herand then only to comment that
it was a. “good” morning.

So I have determined to make love
to her through my column. Oh, the
improbability that she will ever read
these throbbing words! Cruel Fate!
It is not likely that she reads “Lamp
post.” How ‘much more unlikely it is
that she ever reads “Sportorial!”
And yet Badger is not such a bad
looking fellow. It is possible that
out of respect for his beautiful hair
she may glance here a.nd read these
words. Oh,I pray that she may. I
wish my hair was red.

In conclusion, call me up, Babe, if
you read these words (the number is
Penhurst 1273) and let me whisper
into your classic ears those words of
love which burn now on my ﬁngers’
tips. I love you, darling, I love you.

Interfrat Ball
In Semi-Finals

 

Interfraternity mushball is in the
semi—ﬁnals with the surviving teams
being Delta Tau Delta. and Phi Epsi.-
lon Pi in the upper bracket, and last
year’s champion, Phi Delta Theta, and
Sigma still left in the lower bracket.

In the ﬁrst round games of the up-
per bracket Phi Kappa defeated
Lambda. Chi Alpha 8 runs to 2; Delta
Tau Delta defeated Phi Gamma. Delta
10 to 6; Phi Epsilon Pi drew a bye;
and Theta Chi outscored Kappa Sigma
5 runs to 1.

In the ﬁrst round games of the lower
bracket Pi Lambda Phi drew a bye;
Phi Delta Theta defeated Pi Kappa
Alpha 11 runs to 6; Sigma Chi dump-
ed Sigma Alpha Epsilon 9 to 1, and
Sigma Alpha Mu drew a bye.

I Campus Scout I

By John F. Sollinger

First of all dear reader (Mrs. Co-
hen) I feel that it is my duty to en-
lighten you about this person (H.
L. Cohen) who has been a minor part
of the personnel of the Sports staff
on this publication. For the past two

:years, you have been reading a column

called Campus Scout. He thinks he’s
an Indian) and as this is the last
and ﬁnal issue I think that I should
tell the truth.

Mr. Cohen calls himself a Sports
writ.er; what you call him I dare not
write. (After all I only have until
June 6 for that er . . . ahem‘. . .
sheepskin.) Cohen always swells
when the term Sports writer is men-
tioned and so . . . I should like to
go into the requirements of what it
takes to be a . . . the Greeks have a
word for them. Let me assure you
Mr, Cohen ﬁlls these requirements
one hundred per cent.

First: ‘You must have the audacity
always to predict that the home team
will win by six touchdowns. You
will always stand ace-high with the
coach and can secure an unlimited
supply of tickets for the coming sea-
son. Second: Write an open letter
about the athletic department at least
twice a month. Mr. VV. Don Harrison

(gives banquets for this. Third: Gripe

about the salaries the football players
get. Don’t fail to mention they are un-
derpaid. I have this from good au-
thority, Mr. R. E. Badger; And he
should know, he is Sports editor
Fourth: Always mention the glorious
sunset, the pigskin, knights of the
rectangle, timber—toppers-, niblick-
slingers and basketeers in every sport
story you have a chance. This will
serve to confuse your reader and he
won’t have a chance to ‘know what
you are talking about. Fifth: Never
believe a thing a sport writer tells
you or writes about as they are not-
able for stretching the truth. This
column is a ﬁne example of such
practice so, dear reader, let me as-
sure Mr. H. L. Cohen is one of the
ﬁnest boys that I know and I feel
sure that some day he will write
sports for Polk Institut for the In-
sane. -

In the qua.rter ﬁnals Delta Tau
Delta defeated Phi Kappa._3 to 2; Phi
Epsilon Pl beat Theta Chi 16 to 5; Phi
Delta Theta defeated Pi Lambda Phi
10 to 5; and Sigma Chi advanced to
the semi-ﬁnals by nosiugiout Sigma
Chi 2 to 0.

Clifton McClain, president of Sigma
Chi, is chairman of the Int'erfraternity
Mushball League.

Men’s Glee Club Sings

The Men’s Glee club quartet made
a. post-season appearance ,_-before the
School of Pharmacy alumni Thursday

Pitt hotel. Forrest Alter, C36, accom-
panist, played for some group sing-
ing by the alumni. The quartet was
composed of Eugene Burkhart, C36,
‘William Collins, C36, Joseph Morley,
C35, and Harold Heiple, Ed34_

EM SAVING

:-

goes 3

THERE are thousands of easy ways to spend money.
Here’s an easy way to save some . . . right now, when
end-of-the-year activities put such a strain on college
pocketbooks. Make the trip home by Greyhound. You’l1
travel ﬁrst class—in comfort. Greyhound coaches are
ﬁnest on the highway, schedules frequent, and on-the-dot.
Don’t be surprised if you meet friends on the bus-college
students all over America are saving dollars this modern
way.

Greyhound’s service to the Chicago World’s Fair is espe-
cially attractive. Inquire at the local depot, or ask your
Greyhound cit y representative about convenient ex-
pense paid tours, saving time and money, both on the
trip and at Chicago.
