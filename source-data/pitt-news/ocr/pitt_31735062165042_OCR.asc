Flashcards’ First Football Display
Initiated At: Pitt-Nebraska Game

Hundreds in Stand

Form Cornhusker,

Flag, Other Stunts

Pitt’s new Block “P,” a mass
ﬂashcard section on display at
home football games, will
have its ﬁrst tryout this Sat-
urday, Oct. 15, when Pitt
meets Nebraska. Nine hun-
dred students sitting in the
reserved Block “P” section near
mid-field will participate in this
activity.

Membership is open to freshmen
and upperclassmen. The only re-
quirement is that members be at
the Stadium at least forty-ﬁve
minutes before game time to ob-
tain supplies, instructions, and to
practice the stunts for the game.

Supplies will consist of two
ﬂashcards: one red ‘on one side
and white on the other. The-sec-
ond, yellow on one side and blue
on theother. Each stunt will have
a number and will be directed
from the ﬁeld.

PA Announces Stunts

The stunt to be performed will
be announced on the PA system
in addition to a numbered sign
which will be held up from the
ﬁeld. , ’

Block “P” Committee has
planned tentatively on the fol-
‘lowing sfunts for _the Nebraska
game on Oct. 15: the word “Pitt”
spelled out; a panther head; Ne--
braska Cornhusker face with
hat and pipe; ﬂag design_ for
National Anthem; the Cathedral
with traveling elevator; “Hi Ne-
braska,” and a capital “P.”

Members of Block “P” will also
perform for the Miami, Virginia,
and West Virginia games this sea-
son.

Four Purposes

This huge Block “P” section is
being ﬁnanced by the Athletic

-Department and members of the
' block. This organization has four

objectives for operation: to revive
the spirit of big-time football on
campus, to form a central core of
rooters for the cheerleaders, to
providea visual colorful spectacle

BLOCK “P” will go into action
when Pitt plays Nebraska this
Saturday. Above are some of the

tone at 

formations which will be dis-
played by the ﬂashcard section.

stinging defeat by.Navy, meet Bill Glassford’s hearties

S C Letter Protests
Unfair Parking Bans

By RHODA COFSKY'

Student Congress is expecting an answer in -the imme-
diate future to their parking protest letter sent to the Direc-

tor of Public Safety.

At the Monday meeting of Student Congress, President

Robert Sedler read the letter

to write concerning the parking. situation of Sept. 30. He

which he had been authorized

stated that the parking restrictions prior to the Eucharistic
Rally did not take into account‘

the fact that the University was‘

having a full-day of classes and
that it was necessary for students
and faculty to park.

' Future Hope

This letter was also written in
hope of preventing similar situa-
tions in the fu-ture. .

Students who have already
paid the ﬁnes"should wait for ,
the results of the letter; those
who have not yet done so are
urged to protest the ﬁnes in
Traffic Court. ’

Theodore W. Biddle, dean of
men, has also sent a letter to the
Director of Public Safety concern-
ing this situation. —

_ ‘Date’ Tickets

SC also voted to sell football
tickets for the dates of students.
There will be 200 tickets avail-
able for each home game at the’
cost of two dollars per ticket.

Each student will be permitted
to obtain only one extra ticket
and must present both his ac-
tivities card and his identiﬁca-
tion card when purchasing a
ticket. The number of the activi-
ties card will be recorded to pre-
vent students from- purchasing
more than one ticket.

Tickets for all games will go on
sale today at the Student Desk. A
certain percentage of tickets will
be withheld for those students who
do not have their classes at the
University. Such persons will be

 Test Panther Harriers

Although United” Nations

Week doesn’t start officially

until next Tuesday, the cross-country team hopes to stage

an early celebration Saturday
lanova.

when they visit vengeful Vil-

The powerful Wildcats boast two foreignlchaﬂmpions in

their starting seven; Alex Breckenridge, who holds the mile,

championship of Scotland, and the Irish title holder ,at the

same distance, Jim Delaney.
Not content with the cham-
pions of two countries, the Blue
and White ' will also ﬁeld a

w o r 1 d record - holder, John
K o p i I , interscholastic m i l e
titlist.

only one mem-
ber ‘of last 4
year’s squad,
which ﬁnished
third in the
IC4A’s right he-
hind Pitt, the
hosts ﬁgure to
be much strong-
.er. The _only
sophomore on
the squad, De- ,
laney, is one of their strongest
threats.

.. In attempt to repeat their 18-37
victory of last year, the locals will
also be after their twenty-first con-
secutive dua1—meet win in a string
covering three seasons.

This time, however, Coach
Carl 0lson’s proteges will not
have the home-course advan-

_tage. Villanovafs trail is ﬁve

miles long as _compared to the

 

Olson,

A
T

4.3 mile route in Schenley Park.
The Olsonmen have been fortu-
nate in not having any injuries
thus far inthe campaign but as

yet, they have not hit’ their peak.

The harriers appear to be con-
ﬁdent as a result of their 24-37 win
over the Quantico Marines Satur-
day. Even Olson exclaimed, “The
victory ‘was a surprise to me.”

Following this week’s en-
gagement. the hill and dalers
will travel to West Point to en-
counter the 'Cadets and defend-
ing IC4A Champion Manhattan
in a crucial triangular meet
Friday. Oct. 21. ,

If the Panthers can get past the
Villanova roadblock and hurdle
Army and Manhattan, the toughest
part of the schedule will have been
passed. ‘

But unless they show the im-
provement that Olson expects, the
thinclads will be in for" two rough
afternoons. Even in their upset of
the Marines, the local’s times were
not much better than they had
been in the opening meet of the
year.

   

Panther cubs ‘

Meet Mounties

Coach Steve Petro’s freshman
gridders start clawing their way
into a tough four game schedule
by tangling with West Virginia’s
frosh Mountaineers Friday night
at Clarksburg, W. Va.

Faced with a rugged schedule
which calls for all four games
away from home, Petro has a
pretty formidable group of rook-
ies with which to better last year’s
1-2-1 record.

"Listed among this year’s team
are 23 scholarship recruits, eight
having seen All-Star competition

at their respective high schools.

All-Stars Plentiful

Some of the stars corralled this
season by the Panther coaching
staff are backs John Flare of Mid-
land; Bill Kaliden of Homestead;
Fred Riddle of Crafton; Bob Stark
of McKeg~sport; and Jim Lanos of
Munhallfall of whom saw action
in the Allegheny All-Star game.

Back Rich Haly of Midway saw
action with the Washington
County all-stars while Pete Prince,
a back from Alabama, has seen
football action in the Service-

with the Mounties, the Panther
