HWEISBAND . Wilson photo

BY BILL MOORE

Barry Weisband, formally inau-
gurated last night as Student
Government Board (SGB) presi-
dent. promised his Board would
take their responsibility seriously

in hopes of making. a substantial

dent in the wall of student apathy.

“Our problem is clear,” Weis-
band said. “We must convince the
student body their leaders can and
will make a difference.”

He was inaugurated in the S.U.
Lower'Lounge before an audience
including Chancellor Wesley Pos-
var and his staff, University
trustees and Student" Affairs staff
members.

“We will work together when it
is in the students’ interest to work
together," Weisband told the
administrators, “we will barter
when it is in the students’ interest
to barter and we will ﬁght when it
is in the students’ interest to
fight."

_fAS Budget to Decide

Film StudiesFu’rure

BY RICH -HARRY

Funding for a proposed film"
studics program has yet to be
decided, according to Faculty of
Arts and Sciences (FAS) Dean
Jerome Rosenberg.

Rosenberg, speaking at yester-
day's CAS Council meeting, said
the Council's fund request for the
program hinged on the status of the

‘ AS budget.

 He said the FAS budget has been
reduced modestly this year and
that projections over the next four
years indicate “a sustained reduc-
tion of seven to eight percent."

“We are experiencing hard
decisions on the reductions of
major programs," Rosenberg said.
“It's very difficult to give the
highest priority to a new program
(such as ﬁlm studies) when we’re
trying to maintain the funds of the
traditional. existing programs."

The program, unanimously ap-
proved by the Council last year,
dissolved when its director, Wil-
liam Judson, resigned from the
University faculty late last sum-
mer.'

No replacement has been found

because of the unwillingness of
departments to relinquish one of

their faculty, Council members
reported.
Rosenberg indicated he has

discussed with CAS»Dean Robert
Marshall the possibility of provid-
ing a director for the program.

A director is needed as a
consultant who can advise profes-
sors how to utilize films to make
them more meaningful for the
students, history professor Laur-
ence Glasco said.

According to Marshall, the
Council supported the program
because it views film studies as a
liberal arts disciplinelin its own
right, as an area of study
appropriate and necessary in a
large university and as a field
growing in importance and attrac-
tiveness to the student body.

“The Council is mindful" this was
an innovative program," said
Council member Jose Moreno.
“The University should tap areas
where we find needs. The Council
thought this would be an area into
which the University should make
inroads."

Weisband said he and the
six-member Board would try to
serve rather than lead the student
body.

’ The inaugurated Board members
were Chip Hubbard, Larry Glea-
son, Larry Krain, Benita Marcus,
Sune Turner and Robin Wertkin.

Larry Platt, in his last ofﬁcial act
as SGB president, issued the oath
of office to Weisband and offered
his advice.

“It took me this whole year to
conclude that Student Government
is no simply a matter of isolating
problems, preparing arguments
and expecting solutions,” Platt
said‘. “The political needs of

Rumors that the
block black fraternities and sorori-
ties from scheduling programming
in the east wing of the Lothrop
residence proved false during an

open meeting called by the ORL

yesterday.

The wing’s closing was not
aimed at excluding black fraterni-
ties and sororities, explained Tim
Snyder, assistant to the director of
Residence Life, at a meeting of
representatives from the ORL;
Zodakas, an umbrella organization
for black Greeks; the Lothrop Hall
Council and the Resident Student
Association.

“We had a simple case of
miscommunication,” Snyder said. ,

According to Snyder, ORL had
planned to close the east wing
pending an examination of the
guidelines set up by the Lothrop
Hall Council for the use of the
room.

Snyder said Manuel Rhodes, the
Lothrop area coordinator, had been
informed to stop signing up the
room for future events. ’

“He misinterpreted and thought
the east wing would be closed
immediately, and the event sched-\
uled for Friday night was cancel-
led,” Snyder said.

Alpha Phi Alpha originally had
scheduled a social function for that
evening.

According to Snyder, black
fraternities and sororities are the

To Up Appropriation .

BY DENNIS KELLY

Chancellor Wesley Posvar
pledged to wage a vigorous
campaign for increases in the

University's state appropriations at '

the Senate Council meeting Mon-
day. ' .

Gov. Milton Shapp submitted his
proposals for next year’s budget to
the General Assembly last Wed-
nesday. .

The University had asked the
governor for $68.5 million, an
increase of $10.3 million over this

primary users of the wing.

At the meeting, Zodakas Presi-
dent Wayne Gaines agreed the
rumors had been the result of lack
of communication between the ORL
and the black fraternities and
sororities. Gaines called for an

ever. recommended a $59.9 million,

“It is highly likely that there» will’

be alterations in the governor’s
recommendation before the " ﬁnal
budget is passed,” Posvar ex-
plained. “We are going to wage a
veryistrong campaign for support
of increased appropriations in the
next few weeks.”

The proposed budget grants a

Pitt's dorm residents will inflict
more than $23,000 in damages in

the dorms this year, according to_

Housing Director Don Hughes.

That figure compares with the
$21,000 worth of damage reported
last year, he said.

Those costly repairs will be
financed by students, Hughes said,
because the state will not subsidize
housing—considered an auxiliary
service. _

Since last year, there has been a
ﬁve percent increase in “malicious
mischief." the,Campus Police term
for vandalism.

This increase is misleading.
according to officials. because
many cases are unreported..

‘individual administrators are real
‘ and cannot be overlooked.

''It is imperative /that students
.address their arguments not only to

. the issues. but also the problems

the administration faces in imple-
menting student proposals."

— Platt warned the new leaders
against trying to grapple with
problems alone. “The only way to

' resolve students issues is to deal
"with them collectively, as student
leaders." he said.

"Only in this manner can you
creatively and effectively approach
the conflict you soon will face."

_ Posvar, in a congratulatory
speech. expressed a desire to work

with Weisband and the other
student leaders and said that
although conﬂict was inevitable.
communication would eliminate
unnecessary strife.

He praised students and student '
, leaders. “I think Student Govern-

ment is getting better and better,”
he said. ‘‘In the years I’ve been
here. students are becoming more
responsible and more responsive.”
Assistant Vice Chancellor for
Student Affairs Bill Markus,
speaking on behalf of the currently
hospitalized Vice Chancellor for
Student Affairs Alfred Moye, also
complimented the quality of
current student leadership.

“But we have lost a couple of
weks waiting for the election to be
decided." he said. “It is time to get
on with the business of Student

Pitt also suffered complete

The State Board of Education
also deleted monies for dental

Board. its ofﬁcials have said, but
from the Department-of Health,

said. “We also were concerned
about the security problem caused
by the amount of high-school
students attracted to the events
held in the east wing," Snyder
said.

According to the existing guide-
lines. only students with college
IDs and one guest per ID-bearing
person may use theroom.

Representatives of the groups
discussed several changes in the
existing guidelines for use of the
east wing.

The proposal would allow each
group to use the room twice a
week. Currently, groups are
officially restricted to one usage
every two weeks. i

The proposal would also charge
the group using the room, in
conjunction with the Lothrop Hall
Council and the ORL, with
responsibility for security.

The new guidelines, if ratified by
the ORL and the Lothrop Hall
Council, will extend the ‘closing

3 To Pay and Notto Pay a

The latest decision by the Chancellor's Committee on. Ticket

I Distribution to approve a system that goes beyond compromise and
 offers the best of both worlds comes as a pleasant surprise to students.

Reversing its previous decision, the committee is recommending a
system that would provide a no-cost, . ﬁrst-come, ﬁrst-served
distribution of student tickets in the ﬁve days preceding each game.

  Each‘ student has .the option, however, to purchase a $3 season ticket-

that guarantees him a seat for every game without having to stand in
line or run the risk of the limited number of tickets being depleted.

. " So, if the Chancellor decides to accept, a student can have either a w

free seat or a guaranteed one-—putting an end to the heated discussion

' over which is more desirable.

All that’s left before the recommendation ﬁnally goes to the
Chancellor is an agreement on how the money generated by the system
will be used. The best proposal so far calls for the season ticket monies
to/be placed in a special account that will beneﬁt students who attend
football games. . '

e _ “Because it doesn’t seem that a great deal of revenue will be

generated in the account, a good use would be to defray the cost of
buses to away games, since there is a smaller denominator and the
money could be put to greater use per student.

Although the important decision on the tickets already has been
made, the question of where the money goes deserves a simlarly

well-thought-out answer. And especially since the administration has ’

declared time and time again that it doesn’t need the money, the.re’s'no
reason why students shouldn’t have a degree of self-determination

I with their season-ticket revenue.

 Retrospect: Platt’s Year

No one writes history books about student govemments—usually for

A the very good reason that student governments don’t’ merit any sort of

attention. A

Although no one has copyrighted a dissertation on the Platt
administration yet, Larry Platt in his term of ofﬁce did some pretty
historic “things for student representation at Pitt.

The problems Platt dealt with were new, and the system with which
he worked was not necessarily designed to meet those challenges. Platt
cleared a path for the student interest in such diverse areas as tuition
hikes, cutbacks, the legitimacy of the student voice in administrative
decisions and student accounts.

He was not always successful. His experiments did not always bring
victory for student concerns. Tuition still went up. But through Platt’s
energy, and innovation and through the efforts and work of the Student
Government Board membes, a step in the right direction was made.

Platt’s administration accomplished a pioneer attempt at what
student leaders should and can do to inﬂuence the enviromnent at Pitt

; in thebest interests of students. He gave us a hint of what Student

’ Government could do if equipped with the right tools.

If Platt showed us the direction student leaders should take in the
-coming years, his work also demonstrated that the current system of
._ - Student Government at this University is no longer feasible-.
Perhaps now we can work on Student Government at Pitt so that
student leaders with the drive and initiative to work for us can do their
jobs properly. That sort of quality is hard to come by, and it is
. ridiculous to continue wasting it.
Besides offering our thanks, effecting this sort of reform would be
the least we can do for students like [arty Platt. -

  The Virtues of Litter

BY JOHN METCALF E

- l
Last week.I was sitting in what used to be the
Tuck Shop with a friend. We did not stay long, as the
place discourages both conversation and thought. As
we stood to leave, my friendspoke to me. —

“Haven't you forgotten something?” _

“No.” I patted mvself. “I have all of mv books.
and my cigarettes, and I'm "carrying my coat over my
arm. Yes, I have everything.”

“What about this?” She indicated the mess on the
tiny table we had shared. “What about your coffee
cup, and the little envelope from your sugar, and the
two containers which once held synthetic cream, and
the plastic rod you used to stir them all into your
foam cup of coffee? What about those?” ..

A COLUMN AND A HALF A

“The proprietors have hired people to clean up
after the likes of us." I said. .‘‘It is all included in the
price we pay for our coffee.” I observed that she
had stuffed all of her trash into her foam coffee cup,
and even closed the whole collection with its own cap.

“You, for instance," 1 went on, "are posing a severe

threat to the operation of this facility." --

“How so,” she asked, glancing as I had at her
plastic burden. “How am I a threat, when I wish only
to save some wretched employe of this facility the
burden of carrying off my trash?”

“How so, indeed!" asked I, about to launch into
one of the longest stretches of dialogue on record.

“How so?"

“What's theharm in being; neat?”
“Here is where the harm“ is,” said I,
precisely in making this repulsively efﬁcient
operation more efficient. You will observe that it is
not some wretched employe, but rather a comely
young woman who is coming to clear away the little
‘bit of debris which I, on my limited budget, was able

to leave for her. She is glad. She is not obliged to go-

“It is"

home without that minimum wage which is the
highest reward to be expected to common slaves of
the quick-food plantation, nor is she obliged to work
in the stifling kitchen which generates the garbage
she so gladly collects.

“Scoot down a little bit," I continued, and peei:.e_

through those narrow windows.

Look at it. The whole point of this enterprise is not
food, but uniformity. -It is more like publishing than
cooking. Do you truly believe that that young-woman
would rather be back in ' that steaming inferno
assembling identical hamburger after identical
hamburger, putting premeasured squirts of mustard
and -ketchup and patented sauce on premeasured
buns so as to disguise the premeasured patty at the
heart or tne whole cnarade?" _

My friend did not reply, so I went on.

“Do you imagine that all of this monstrosity is
inhuman? It is not. Most of the, employes are

.human; indeed, many of them are students much as

you and I, obliged by cruel circumstance to work’ for

this mindless system, and always at the lowest

permissible wage.
I sobbed.

“Do you see what will happen if you persist in this ‘

heartless neatness? Do you imagine that this
corporate interloper into the life of the University will
be so kind as to keep that young woman on the
payroll, even at her niggardly wage, if there is
nothing for her to clean up?

“I didn't realize!” my friend said. Her eyes were
full of tears. She threw her trash back down onto the

Throughout my stay at Pitt I have

review concerning Steel Symphony
hascompletely turned my stomach.

In _this' critique. by A. Irene

referred to as “off-base." Ms.l

BY BILL MOORE

“If students don't care about
such things, why did 185 more
people turn out in the second
election than the first, despite
some harebrained attempts to keep
voters from knowing lwhen the
second election was held." some-
one asked yesterday.

The answer, quite honestly, is
that no.one knows.

But taking a few off-the-cuff
guesses is nevertheless interest-
mg.

First of all, some claim it has
something to do with the increased
publicity due to the Weisband
contest and the Gronsky appeal.

But The Pitt News gives the SGB
elections heavy coverage as it is.
Starting about one month before
the vote. the front page starts
displaying larger and larger stories
on the Election Committee and the
cand_idates. Traditionally. though.
all oftliat topped off with about 100
column inches of interviews
dpcsn't stir more than a small"

pi“o’port_ion ‘of the apatlietic ni_asses_. -.

If another 50 inches or so of
type can pull two per cent more of
the student population into the
voting booths, then The Pitt News
should start running a few
thousand inches on the election and
pull in an extra 60%. But chances
are it_would "all be a waste of time.
There are better things to read,
such as “Fuzzyweeks.”

. If undergraduates know when
and where to vote, who is running,
the issues, and the stands, The Pitt
News is doing its job.

BEHIND THE LINES

The only two factors that could
conceivably cause an upsurge in
voting would be 1) if students
suddenly decide ‘who runs SGB

does make a difference. or 2) if -

students decide that their votes
make a difference. The second
item is probably the answer.
Gronsky only won the first
election by 32 votes. If 17 of those
people had decided to vote for

Weisband at the last minute. the.

results would have been different.

Perhaps. two per cent of Pitt's
l3.000 full-tinie undergraduates
saw the first vote total and decided

to see wliat_thci_r vote would do the 

spctiiid tim_e_ §.,1l.‘0Lll]Cl_.‘-" -   .

. ’ p
' »

  SomeFacts Behind’ the Vote

Both factors mentioned are
seriously undermined by the
turnout—-14%. If students cared,
or valued their vote, the count
would obviously be higher.

One question remains, and that
is a bit easier to explain. Why did
Weisband win the second time
what he didn't win the first?
This is due unarguably to three
factors. ~ . .

1) Most important, those who
voted the first time around fdr

'Larry Chaban and Mark Satinoff

realized in the second election it
was only a two-man race. More of
their votes went to Weisband than
to Gronsky.

2) Weisband had created an
image in his contest. He won his
fight to have the election invali-
dated. while Gronsky lost his
appeal. Consciously or unconsci-
ously. voters» thought of Weisband
as a winner when they entered the
booths last week. If you believe the
cynics. a good image means
infinitely more than the issues.

In any case. a 14%

I Recent college graduates have
discovered their education no
"longer'guarantees their entry into
iejob market. But while many
graduates stream into unemploy-
ment ofﬁces. a few have turned to
‘Youth Cityof Pittsburgh lnc., an
‘organization dedicated to helping
‘young adults.
 Youth City's original purpose
_ was drug education and abuse
9.-prevention, according to Bill
jO'Neill, director and founder of the
7 eight-year-old‘organization. But it
~ gradually has expanded its opera-
tions to_ help runaways, ex-con-
 iuts, high-school dropouts, college
_ students. In short, young people
 with all types of problems.
’ 5.’ Last summer, Youth City found
« jobs for approximately 200 college
__ students. By checking City offices,
’ community centers and local
‘businesses, Y_outh City was able to
V unearth many job opportunities. It
;'then contacted the placement
centers at Pittsburgh's universi-
‘ties./which referred interested
-students to Youth City.
“Students often don’t know of
“jobs or that they are entitled to
“them,” O’Neill said. “We make it
“our business to be a pest to the City
gfathers.
- ‘ ”The first thing employers say to
students is that they don’t have
,enough work experience. How can

match students up with jobs related
totheir majors."

Youth City is not federally
funded and receives no money for
hiring or placing students, but
according to O'Neill, the number of
jobs his organization can ﬁnd for
students this summer may be very
limited if the City and County
programs and agencies that hire
students don’t receive adequate
funds from the government.

“If President Ford okays the
money for summer employment
programs, the City and County will
be able to hire the students,”
O’Neill said. ‘

Though O’Neill de-emphasizes
the employment activities of his
organization (“We ﬁnd the best for
our people if that means hospitals,
housing, legal aid, or even jobs”),
he admits that he views the job
program as a deterrent to crime.

Young college students prepar-
ing to be doctors, lawyers or
professionals of some sort are
usually the last ones anyone ever,
suspected ‘of committing crimes.
But according to O’Neill, crimes by
such students are on the rise.

“If these young people just fresh
out of school can’t get jobs and are
indebted to someone—loan com-

panies. parents—they will do

something illegitimate such as
selling drugs to make the so called‘
fast buck. We try to catch people
before they get started.”

The major goal of Youth City's
program, however, is to catch the
attention of as many students and
employers as possible. “Our
purpose is to make students aware
that someone out there needs
them." O’Neill said. “And we try

to show employers that there are

young people available to ﬁll their
needs." . ,

Eszterhas Down On Narks

BY BILL MOORE

"There is a certain type of
human being that becomes a nark.
They are deputized gangsters,
hoods legitimized by the shields
they've been given—their shields a
symbol of corruption.”

Joe Eszterhas minces no words
when it comes to narcotics
enforcement officers, commonly
called narks. He knows many
narks, hates most of them, and
fears them all. A

The author of Nark!, a close,
critical look at narks and their
methods, Eszterhas is running
what might be called a personal
vendetta, an attempt to ﬁght the
steadily increasing instances of
narcotics ofﬁcers overstepping the
bounds of the law.

Speaking at Pitt Monday night,
he told of “Gestapo-like” tactics

- used to hunt down even minor drug

users, and to force those suspects
to turn against friends, even
family, to stay out of jail. “It’s a
guerrilla assault, a psychic search-
and-destroy mission.”

Backing his
example after example, the 31-
year-old Rolling Stone magazine
senior editor blamed the courts,
and especially the media, for
letting the /narks get away with,
quite literally, murder.

“Marijuana isn’t going to lead
anyone to the grave, or the smack
needle, and they know that,” he
said. “But a hundred marijuana
arrests will garner a hundred
headlines—99 more headlines than
working anonymously all year to

' bust a single kingpin heroin dealer. ,

They work busily for the hundred
headlines because the headlines
pay off in raises, promotions,
prestige and power.”

iWhile it is bad enough to bust
college kids for pufﬁng instead of
studying, hesaid, it is ‘even worse
when the harassed college kid trys

to ﬁght it in court, or complains
about the narks’ tactics. “So the
kid claims he was pistol-whipped

during the arrest. So he claims his .

girl was propositionedi by the
arresting ofﬁcers. So what? A kid
who’s been busted for possession
of a lid doesn’t have the clout to
spark public outrage.”

One of the only ways to alleviate
the system would be to ﬁght for
publication of the facts, Eszterhas
argued. “Or, they could always
legalize it, then there wouldn’t be

_any problem at all.”
Legalization is not an impossible‘

dream, Eszterhas added. “These
things are, of course, determined
to a large extent by politics, and the
(1976 presidential) elections will

dope bust, the narcotics agent-

evil. ~

You can do it, too. So far over 550,000 other people have done it. People who
have different jobs, different lOs, different interests, different educations have
completed the course. Our graduates are people from all walks of life. These
people have all taken a course developed by Evelyn Wood, a prominent
educator. Practically all of them at least tripled their reading speed with equal or
better comprehension. Most have increased it even more. -

Think for a moment what thatmeans. All of them—even the slowest—now read
an average novel in less than two hours. They read an entire issue of Time or
Newsweek in 35 minutes. They don't skip or skim. They read every word. They
use M machines.’ Instead, they let the material they're read.ng determine how
fast they read. And mark this well: they actually understand more, remember
more, and enjoy more than when they read slowly. That's rightl They

4 Hankin Exhibition

Conflicts in Realistic Style

BY MREA CSORBA

Some of Steve Hankin’s New

,-Realism paintings currently at the

Shadyside Arts and Crafts Center
border on a Pygmalian miracle.
Others are like wax museum pieces
that miss the breath of life. At his
best, Hankin’s lifelike, seemingly
three-dimensional painted figures
3! appear ready to walk off the
canvases to join in the circulation of
life. «
In fact his richly detailed
rendition of friends have a
“larger-than-life” _ quality. Our
eyes may miss the ﬁner intricacies

of real life’s images, but through _

'Hankin’s large canvases, each
wrinkle, each arm, hair and neck

‘ vein is brought to our attention.

Hankin’s portrayals are of people
we seem to know. You feel you
recognize his “Red Head.” You’ve
seen her at a party or at a friend’s
house just as she is now—-sitting on
the edge of her chair to hear the
conversation better. But now you
can take in details about her that
you may have missed before. You
notice the golden shine of her kinky
hair, the shadows thrown between
the folds of her shirt, and the
‘evident roughness of her work-
worn hands. a

Equally authentic is Hankin’s
“Guitar Player” caught ‘at the
moment of a difficult strum. You
stare at the uncanny portrayal,
surprised that his music remains

unheard.
Detail is Hankin’s forte. He
enjoys displaying his skill on

clothing folds, terry-clothed tex-
tures and Indian rug motifs in his
paintings. For this reason, “Nude
with a Mirror’-’ seems to be a
Hankin stepchild. Her simple body

      

must be barren territory for an
artist who enjoys a ﬂourish of
design.

It seems to be a hurried,
neglected ‘work in which Hankin
appears impatient to get on with
more richly detailed subject mat-
ter. Her far side seems flat, the
modeling of-her foot careless. and

the veins of her hand, are
disturbingly just bluish-gray paint

McCann Jazz Hit

BY NORM MARTELLO

The Buddha-like black man sat
down behind the belly-high box
(Rhodes electronic keyboard) and
ARP synthesizer as the band
assembled on the low risers.
Plugged into one end of the small
room, Les McCann and company
gave the college students a revival
meeting. It wasn’t to testify for the
Lord. Rather, it was a testimony to
life, struggle and love. And he
made the children dance...oohh...
he made the children dance.

Monday’s early afternoon con-
cert’ (great time for one) at the
North Side campus of Allegheny
Community College opened with
“Someday We’ll Meet Again.”
Playing high-toned runs on the
synthesizer, McCann’s ﬁngers ran
over the keyboards like those of a
funky pianist at symphony hall. His
synthesizer became one of the
greatest nonliving trumpet players
ever; he tinkled star music from his
Rhodes and wailed saxophone-like
solos, which sounded as if they
were straight from the heavenly

domains of Charlie Parker and ~

John Coltrane. ‘

Drummer Harold Davis opened

the second tune, “Go On and Cry,”
rockin’ steady on the back beat. His
rhythms were sometimes calypso,
sometimes Philadelphia street
rock, sometimes jazzy brushes,
rubbing drum head and nylon-
tipped sticks, tapping cymbals like
little raindrops.

No one danced during his two
intense, frustration-loosing solos.
Eyes were glued on the man's
face—contorted in an attempt to
blast‘ beyond. '

Pittsburgh native Miroslav
Kudykowski handled his electric
Gibson to the delight of the blues
guitar freaks in the audience. No

need to wish for Eric Clapton’s lost

guitar with talented cats like
Miroslav around. -

The small size of the room, the.

people who weren’t afraid to get up

    

to dance, and regular heckling

between the audience and McCann .

made the show intimate. So
responsive was the scene that
when, in the spirit of the concert, I
let out a war" whoop, I could sense
the reverberating acceptance of it
in the audience and among the
band members. That is intimate.
McCann made it fun. Leading
into one song, he drove his Rhodes
as'—a space trucker would, beep-
beeping and growling, “Pull over,
goddammit.” Audience participa-
tion was requested and supplied
again and again; even when the

mass. A

sang, “Let it go, girl...” and
stopped to joke and jive with the
audience: _ A

“Where was I, now?” McCann
says.

“Ya let it go,” someone hollers
from the friendly crowd.-

WVUGame; A
Score (To Settle 1

 

BY TOM HALL
Sports Editor

Fighting to avoid an almost inevitable losing season, the Panthers
will take their road show to the West Virginia Coliseum to meet the
Mountaineers tonight. A

The Panthers have proven themselves a better team than their 8-13
record would indicate, but that they have yet to win outside the Field
House or the Civic Arena is cause for concern; Throw in that in
Morgantown the Cats will have to contend with 14,000 rabid fans

screaming “Beat the hell out of Pitt,” and the Panthers have two .

chances to pull out a win—Slim and None. (And Slim’s leaving town on
the next bus out.) _ ' '
For Pitt to end this season over the .500 mark, a win is essential.
However, a win at the Coliseum is, in a word, impossible. .
Do I have a reason for such profound pessimism? Indeed, ‘the

- Panthers have never won a game in the Coliseum. And some rather

distinguished. teams have failed in the past. The 1974-75 team,_
featuring Mel Bennett, Keith’ Starr and Kirk Bruce, lost there, the
second game of the season.

That same team was beaten (ﬁguratively?) again in the ECAC
Southern Division championships, again by an evidently inferior WVU
squad.

Stabbing back into the past yet another year, in 1973, the Cats
dropped an 82-78 decision in the Coliseum. That Panther team, which
included Bill Knight and Mickey Martin, ran off 22 straight wins after
that and ﬁnished the season 25-4.

Perhaps a win isn’t impossible. But avoiding a ﬁght will be. In the

Pitt-WVU game at the Field House last month, there were three

separate. skirmishes. Wayne Talbott and _WVU’s Maurice Robinson ’,

were ejected from the game.
With the game all but put away, the Mountaineers’ Stan Boskovich

decided that all was not lost, so he wrapped Tom Richards around the .

basket support, just as a reminder that, “We’ll'see you in Morgantown
later on.” Richards was out of action for ﬁve games.. ‘

Hetz: Rookie 0fThe Year

BY PATTY TASCAKRELLA

Let's face it, the kid’s got it.
Curt Hetz is a mere freshman, yet
he's already totalled 27 points, tops
on the Pitt Hockey Club. How
many rookies can claim similar
records: 12 goals, 15 assists, with
the ﬁnal leg of the season still

stretching ahead?

The 19-year-old left-winger took
up hockey 10 years ago while living
in Toronto. ‘

“Ijust happened to be living in
Canada at the time I was looking
for a sport to play and hockey is

the big sport up there,” Hetz said.

After moving to Pittsburgh, his
parents contacted the then-presi-
dent of the Pittsburgh Area Hockey
League (P.A.H.L.), Len Barcalow,
who recognized the boy’s talent
and got him started in local
competition.

freshman star.

“He’s a gritty, little guy,”
Barcalow commented. “He has
great talent. ’We can use him on
penalty killing or on the power
play—he has what it takes. The
way he is now is indicative that
he'll be a great one.”

At 5-5, with the face of a modern
Huckleberry Finn, Hetz hardly
looks like the aggressive player he
is. This season, he’s spent 22
minutes in the penalty box, which
goalie Larry Newill, Hetz’s team-
mate since their days at Shaler
High, jokingly estimates as one-_
third the time Hetz spent there

. his senior year. A

Spikers Yearn Attention

BY CRIS HALL

It's not an officially recognized
varsity team.

It's not even a club. It has no
University recognition whatsoever.

It's a group of dedicated athletes
who pay for the privilege of
traveling across the eastern United
States to represent our. seemingly
ungrateful University in a sporting
endeavor.

It's the Pitt volleyball 

Looking toward possible accept-
ance by the athletic department.
the team has participated in five
tournaments this season and has
advanced to the finals in three of

,4-,tl1em.

.-l

D‘ This past weekend. it competed
in the Penn State collegiate
tournament. playing against many
of the Eastern powers. including
Delaware. Rutgers and the host

team.

The team will participate in 10 or
II tournaments before the season
is out. half of them sporting ﬁelds
comprised entirely of collegiate
squads and the remainder spon-
sored by the U.S. Volleyball
Association. ‘

Official university recognition is
a rarity in college volleyball.
Rutgers‘ team. one comprised
mainly of foreigners and scholar-
ship athletes. is a rarity in that it is
sponsored by the university as an
intercollegiate team.

‘_fPitt's" squad. despite its
obvious disadvantage, came as
close as 15-10 against Rutgers, and
this gives captain John “Huck"
Finn hope for the future.

“We're going to attack our
problems one step at a time." he
said. “First we are seeking

recognition and after that will come
our bid for allocation."

As to whether he forsees Pitt as
ever recognizing the squad as
anything more than a club, Finn
declared. “I would definitely like to
see that come about. but realistic-

ally don't expect to see it happen-

while I'm around."

A sophomore who played for
Penn Hills High School, Finn is not
concerned about the present lack of
student interest in his team.

“We are not really concerned’-

about fan support right now,”,he
said. “We're just trying to get the
program started. ‘

“If we can get recognition and
establish ourselves, the student
interest would probably follow.

“But the way things look now,
that could be a long time in
coming." ' '
