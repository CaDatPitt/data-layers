A Carnegie-Mellon Univer-
sity professor, winner of the
1978 Nobel Prize in economics
for his research on decision-
making processes in economics,
has devoted 20 years of his life to
the study of man’s thought
patterns.

Dr. Herbert A. Simon, an R.
K. Mellon professor of computer
science and psychology at
C-MU, and his colleagues have
attempted to simulate the
creative process artists use
whenthey produce works of art.
They believe they have had
some success in copying crea-
tivity with computer programs.
Simo’n even ‘has some original
designs a’ computer has pro-
duced.

The professor said he felt both

“great” and “a little numb”
after -learning he had won the
coveted award.

C-MU President Richard
Cyert had only praise for Simon
after announcement of the
award Monday and described

him as ‘ ‘the one, man in the world _ 7

who comes closest to the ideal of
being an Aristotle or a
Renaissance man.”

. Simon’s attempts to repro-

duce the creative process have

‘not gone unchallenged by other

professors who do not believe‘ all
the workings of the human mind
can be recreated with a

computer program.

Robert Lepper, a professor of
painting, design and architec-
ture at C-MU, argued during ‘a
1965 debate that creativitylis not '
similar to any computer process.
He saidthen, “Some people are

creative and some only vegetate
. . .a cabbage would be unlikely to
'dig its own irrigation ditch.”
Joseph Weizenbaum, a com-
puter expert at the Massachu-
setts Institute of Technology,
has questioned a growing belief
that computers could _be pro- _
grammed to act as therapists for‘
the emotionally disturbed.
Weizenbaum said computers
could not empathize with
patients, and they would then
recognize the computer as a.
mere ‘machine. 4
Simon readily defends his
research against the criticisms
of Lepper and Weizenbaum.
“Creativity,” he told Lepper in
1965, “is only mysterious if you
assume it involves an unknown, ’
unconscious process that is
c_l_i_fferentlfrom anything that goes
on in the conscious mind.”

Most landlord-tenant clashes
develop when tenants fail to read
and understand their leases,
according to attorney Tom Tripp,
Monday’s featured speaker at the
Landlord-Tenant Seminar spon-
sored by the Legal Awareness
Committee.

Tripp, representing a local
private law ﬁrm, is one of several
"attorneys who acts as consultants
for Legal Awareness and dispenses
free legal counseling to Pitt

* students.

“In most cases, the language in
the lease is clearly spelled out,”
Tripp said. “If people Iwpuld just
take 15 or -20 minutes to read the

L lease, it‘ wouldbecome clear that

they are waiving many of their rights
as tenants.” P’ ‘ ’

Tripp said prospective tenants
must be made aware that a lease is
like a contract; every agreement
made by both parties legally is
binding in cotirt.

A recent ruling by the Pennsyl-
vania Supreme Court clearly defined
the obligations of both parties. The
ruling stated that landlords not only
must provide the exact space‘ a
tenant originally looked at but also
must make sure that space is
habitable.

“For the ﬁrst time ever, he (the
landlord) must not only guarantee
you four walls and a roof but also that
you can live there,” Tripp said.
“Even if the lease doesn't say it, the
court will imposeon the landlord that
the » apartment must. be habitable. ’ ’

Tripp said that -when deciding
upon a 1andlordl’s negligence the
court will consider whether the

alleged problem poses an immedi-
ate safety' problem or directly
violates the city housing code. If a

health violation is apparent, the

court usually will rule in favor of the

tenant. ’

The age of the structure and the
length that the violation‘ has been
left unattended are other areas
considered by the courts.

In cases when the landlord is
found guilty of leasing property that
is faulty in any of these areas the
court usually will rule that the
violation is sufficient enough to
warrant nonpayment of rent for the
period of time the violation existed.

Tripp said a large number of
problems arise with security
deposits. '

capitalize on Flaherty’s name in his

 bidfor reelection to the House of
 Representatives. -

Flaherty 1 said the six-term

.  congressman has been distributing

' campaign literature with Flaherty’s

 _ name above Filberg’s. ' Flaherty

took " time from his campaign
schedule yesterday to rush to the

_ -, congressman’s‘ northeast Philadel-

‘. ‘ flattack. *

“He’s hopingto ride on my
coattails,” Flaherty said on the

 sidewalk outside Filberg’s north-

east Philadelphia ofﬁce. ‘‘He’s

. distributing literature as though we

are running ‘together. I want the

voters to know, the public to know

and ‘Mr. Filberg to know that I am
no way associated with his
campaign. .

“l' demand ’he remove my good
name from his political literature. I
think it’s repulsive. I would not’ ask
anyone ‘to vote for him.”

He went ‘to Filberg’s paneled
ofﬁce and‘ delivered a letter of
protest about the campaign liter-
ature to Filbert’s secretary. Charles
Duld, Filberg’s district office
manager, came out of Filberg’s
office and said, “The Congressman
can’t‘see you. at the "present time.
He’s indisposed. He’s on the
phone ‘to his Washington office.”

Duld then brusquely retreated
into the office, closing the door on
Flaherty and ‘reporters.

Flaherty demanded that Filberg

Pope John Paul ii Promises'MinisiryoflL

By The Associated Press

VATICAN CITY— "Pope John
Paul II promised yesterday that a
“ministry of love” would mark his
reign as the 264th pontiff of the
Roman Catholic Church.

The former Cardinal Karol
Wojtyla of Krakow, Poland, also
took a trop outside Vatican walls on
his ﬁrst full day as leader of the
world’s 700 million Catholics.

In a televised sermon delivered
under Michelangelo's fresco “The

Last Judgment” in the Sistine

Chapel, the pope pledged to carry on
the church reforms launched by the
Second Vatican Council of 1962-65
and- to follow the guidelines laid
down by Paul VI and John Paul 1.

Vatican officials, meanwhile,
announced that John Paul would
preside at a Mass at his installation
on Sunday. The announcement
made no mention of a coronation,
implyingthat he would continue
the pattern of John Paul I, who
refused to be crowned the temporal
ruler of the church.

From Warsaw, Polish Communist
leader Edward Gierek sent a
message to the pope, saying his
election “ﬁlls Poland with great
satisfaction” and that he was
“convinced that further develop-
ment of relations between Poland
and the Apostolic See” would come
about. V

A Polish government spokesman,
Kazimierz Kakol, said passport
restrictions would be eased to allow a

“large number” of Poles to travel to
Rome for the installation. He did not

say how many visas would be
granted. Poles normally have to wait
three to four weeks to obtain a travel
visa. '

In his first papal sermon, the

‘58-year-old pontiff warned that the

“general criteria of loyaltyto the
Vatican Council” must not affect
loyalty to the basic‘ doctrinal truths of
the church. This was perhaps an
indication -_ that he would pursue a

conservative stance on such matters
as the church’s ban on artiﬁcial
contraception, the ordination of

Perish in Morning Fire  

By The Associated Press

PHILADELPHIA—“They were
screaming to me but what was I
going to do? I couldn't stand to
look,” sobbed Maria Marrero, a
neighbor of afamily of eight who
perished yesterday when a pre-
dawn ﬁre of suspicious origin
trapped them inside their brick row
house. ' '

The victims included four teen-

age girls and their parents, and two ‘

young men, the dead woman’s
chi1dr_en“by a previous marriage,
according to Dr. Marvin Aronson,
city medical examiner.

Two of the victims jumped from
the burning building, located in a
predominantly Hispanic and black
neighborhood in the city’s north-
west section, ﬁre officials said.

Witnesses reported smelling a
strong odor of gasoline, and ﬁre
officials and homicide detectives
were investigating possible arson.

A second family who lived in the

three-story building——a mother and
father and‘ their six children whose.
surname is Aponti—escaped with-
out injury,
Commissioner Joseph McKenna.‘
“They were screaming in Span-
ish, ‘Call the ﬁre department! Call.

the ﬁre department!’ Itwas a"

shame. I was’ just standing there - .
and I couldn't help,” said Zorada" 
26, Mrs. Marrero’s 

Marrero,
daughter. \

The two women were sleeping in
their apartments across the street

from the gutted building when they rjf:
were awakened by the pleas for‘-_~} 

help.

Miss Marrero said the blaze "

spread so quickly the entire
building was in ﬂames in about four
minutes. She said she reported the
ﬁre to police and seconds later

noticed a member of the’ Aponti '

family running down- the street in
his underwear to pull the ﬁre alarm.

Warnke Predicts SALT ll Accord‘

PI'ITSBURGH—On the eve of renewed treaty talks in
“ Moscow, U.S. strategic arms negotiator Paul Warnke urged
restraint yesterday in the deployment of a version of the
controversial cruise missile. '

Warnke, who was to leave for Moscow yesterday evening
on his last major assignment after recently announcing his
resignation, also predicted that agreement on SALT II is
possible by year's end.

“If we make some major steps in our meetings on the 22nd

Strikes Hit Cambria, Indiana Counties

BARNESBORO, Pa.—An estimated 4,500 miners in
Cambria and Indiana counties were off the job yesterday in
wildcat walkouts. _

The strike started Monday at the Greenwich Collieries,
where about 1,000 miners and construction workers were
idled by roving pickets. ‘

By yesterday, the strike had affected miners at 1,300
Barnes and Tucker operations; 1,500 workers at the
Bethlehem Mines; more than 800 miners at Rochester and
Pittsburgh Coal Co. portals, and a number of other mines.

Officials of the companies and the United Mine Workers
have not speciﬁed the reason for the strikes. .

National
Feds Release Drinking Figures ‘

WASHINGTON—An estimated 10 million Americans are
problem drinkers or alcoholics, and drinking may be to blame
for as many as 205,000 deaths a year, federal health ofﬁcials
reported yesterday. ’

The risk of death from disease, accident or violence is two to
six times greater for the problem drinker than for the
population at large, the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse
and Alcoholism said in its third special report to Congress.

But the acting director of the institute said the report also
has good news, including statistics showing a decline in
deaths from cirrhosis of the liver, a drop in per capita alcohol
consumsption and a rise in the number of alcohol treatment

Pollution Controls Hold Consolidated Profits

PI'I'I‘SBURGI-I-—Consolidation Coal Co. said yesterday A
it faces the loss of coal orders that will total 3 million tons by

V programs.
‘ State Economic Outlook Stable

“As a nation, we seem _to be getting a handle on the
problem,” said Loran D. Archer, the acting director.

1980 because of stringent air pollution standards in two
midwestern states. ’

“That is currently one-half of our production capacity in
Ohio,” a Consolidation spokesman said.

The fuel generally sells for about $25 to $30 a ton, which
means Consolidation stands to lose between $75 million and
$90 million.

The nation's second-largest coal. producer, based in
Pittsburgh, said the cutbacks may force it to “significantly”
reduce its 2,400-member work force in eastern Ohio, where
high~sulfur coal is mined. ' -

STATE COLLEGE—The state’s economy should remain
stable for the near future, according to a business analyst at
Penn State University.

‘ ‘Early reports show some drop in both hard_ and soft goods ‘

production in September, but heavy industry improvements
should help to hold the economy at levels not far from where
they are now,” said Alice Warne, editor of the Pennsylvania
Business Survey, a Penn State University publication.

The state’s steel production improved for the first’ time in
two months by reaching 2.4 million tons in August, Warne
said. _ -

Carter Pushes Negotiations.

WASHINGTON—-—President Carter stepped personally
into the Middle East peace talks yesterday, meeting
separately at the White House with the heads of the Israeli
and Egyptian delegations. l

Administration ofﬁcials denied that Carter intervened in
an effort to overcome an impasse in the talks, although the
pattern of separate meetings was the "same asthe president
used at Camp David to try to bridge impasses there.

does send the tenant a list of the _

validity of the list, the tenant can sue

Tripp warned students not to

l ' sublet apartments, because, (unless

a new lease is signed between the
new tenant and the landlord,) the
original tenant is responsible for any
later rent. and damage payments.
Tripp suggested that students
request a “substitute lease,”
signed by the landlord, which
cancels legal responsibilities of the
original tenant.

“We’ve had cases before where
students have sublet their apart-

‘ ments, forgot about it and, a few

months later, find that the people
they sublet to have left,” he said.

“In a case like this you are still ' A

responsible for -paying the rent
because your name is the original
one on the lease.”

To prevent such cases, Tripp
urged students who sublet to get
phone numbers and addresses from
those subleting the 'apartments.

Tripp and Legal 1 Awareness
offered several suggestions to
off-‘campus students to avoid or deal

“ with landlord problems:

——Even a slight violation of a
lease can bring forth an eviction
notice from a landlord. It, is
important that tenants carefully
read any lease before signing it.

—If the lease is vague or if there

is any point that the tenant does not
understand, the landlord and tenant

' should attempt to make a mutual

agreement. The landlord should
agree to strike any unclear,
unconstitutional or undesirable
point.

Rumors Spread through Lothropafter Rapes ShockResidents

(Continued from page 1)

The facts, according to a reliable campus police of- .

ficer, are that two unrelated rapes have occurred at
MCNR, that there have been reports that the suspect
in the second rape has been seen in MCNR and has
harrassed women in shower stalls and that the cam-
pus police have a description and are searching for
the man. He also said the rumors were “understand-
able” but an “overreaction.” *

The stories may be exaggerations, but the fear is
very real. i

,“Everyone’s scared stiff,” one Lothrop resident
said. “There was almost a panic a couple of days
ago, when this began to come out.”

“You have to sneak around corners,” another

’ said, “and when you go into the bathroom, you kick‘

open every stall to make sure no one’s there.”

“There is cause for concern,” said Don Hughes,

director of housing. “But I don’t think there's cause‘
for alarm. “We’ve had calls from students and from
parents, and we’re working on things like improving

security procedures and making building
motifications.” .

One modification needed, according to another
campus policeman, is a different emphasis on where
officers are positioned. “We’ve short-staffed,” he
said. “So when we needed a guy, he was yanked
from Lothrop.”

That will not happen in the near future. Extra of-
ficers have been stationed in Lothrop, along with
plain-clothed officers, and another desk attendant is
checking ID’s near the elevators. ‘

“But we can put locks on locks and doors on
doors,” Hughes said, “and an area still can be only
as secure as the residents make it.”

Hughes need not have any fear on that account.
Though usually as lax as any students, the residents
of MCNR currently are employing buddy systems
and signup sheets for rest room visits and, showers,
are patrolling their halls and are _confron_ting
strangers.

“I walked through the hall last night,” Fred Fon-
seca, office of resident life director, said yesterday.

“And I was stopped several times by people wanting .

to know who I was. It’s unfortunate the atmosphere
has to be as it is now, but I was encouraged that
students were taking security seriously.”

Several meetings, involving floors and the entire
hall, have been held, and students have been warned
and given the chance to offer suggestions. ‘

“We’ve gone through the entire_building,” Fon-‘
seca said, “and we haven't found much other than a
couple of areas where security could be tighter. We
want to calm things down a bit and give (campus
police chief) Curt (Graham) a chance to do his thing.

“We’re going to continue the extra desk by the
elevators, and we’ll have an extra officer patrolling,”
he added. “The physical things can be fixed rather-
easily, but dealing with the emotions involved is
tougher.

“Naturally, we’re trying to make this situation a

hell of a lot better than it is now.” .
One way would be to make as much factual infor-
mation as possible available as soon as possible.

Image Molders Export Electronic Campaigns to Venezuela   B

By The Associated Press .

CARACAS, Venezuela--The
candidates are not familiar to many
Americans, but their‘ advisers —-
with such names as Patrick Cadell,

David Garth and Clifton White —

may well be.

Political image molders; media
experts and public opinion analysts
are the latest U.S. export to this
oil-rich South American democracy
that already imports billions of
dollars worth of American products

' As campaigning heats up for the
presidential election Dec. 3, the
American consultants have been in
thenews almost as much as the
candidates. They are ridiculed by
television comedians and provoke
screams of foul play from small
leftist parties unable to afford
high-powered help. -

“What would people say if I
brought in Soviet advisers, eh?”

grumbles the Communist Party’s

candidate, Hector Mujica.
The space-age political tactics,

patterned after U.S. campaigns,

have sparked press headlines like

“War of the TV Ads” and “Dance
of the Millions,” a reference to the
gigantic sums of money going into
campaign advertising.

The money is big because the
names are big. They include:George
Gallup, who visited a branch of his
prestigious public opinion institute
established here last year to get a
piece of the political action.

Joe. Napolitan, author of “The

Election Game and How to Win It”
and adviser in Hubert Humphrey’s
1968 campaign. He is the only U.S.
expert with experience ;in a
Venezuelan presidential campaign
and has been hired to oversee the
advertising campaign of Luis
Pinerua Ordéz, candidate of the’
party in power, Democratic Action.

Clifton White, an organization
and staff expert who has worked for
Sen. Barry Goldwater. He is also
assisting Pinerua.

‘After Pitt’sJ;esident students pay their housing
fees at the beginning of each term, they should not
have to spend even more moneyon a crash course in

9:: selff-defense before moving in; Once the University,
‘ always quick todemand payment, takes thehousing , _

fee from a student, it has the responsibility to provide
for the security of that student and do whateveris
possible to ensure his safety.

Tell that to the female residents of Lothrop Hall.
Already this term .there allegedly‘ have been" two

‘sexual assaults and at least two incidences of a male’
. intruder prowling women’s bathrooms. Now studen-

ts are responding to the challenge of any attackers

" with organized ﬂoor patrols. That is an excellent
 safety measure, but it does not help solve the overall
 problem of a shocking lack of security at Lothrop
S Hall.

People can enter Lothrop Hall six ways, which, if

 recent events are any indication, are five too many.

Besides the main-entrance, two passages from the.

  Victoria Building are open for part of the day. Also

people may enter through the loading dock, a tunnel

7 from Presbyterian Hospital and a street-level door

that connects with the first floor. It is not hard to
figure out that, with so many points of entrance, un-

make every student their potential victim. _
If possible, there should be only one entrance to

-Lothrop Hall, and if necessary, 24-hour security

  Kinivérsity I
  Responsible for
 A Dorm Security

should be instituted. Before being allowed access to

-the rooms, people should be forced to present—not

ﬂash at a distance—proper identification.

Some people may claim that 24-hour security is an
inconvenience—but so wh_at? When people. are
scared and believe it is even unsafe to go ‘to the
bathroom alone, inconvenience for a few becomes

_ secondary to,the peace of mind of many. For exam-

ple, the tunnel connecting Lothrop to Presbyterian
«Hospital is used often by doctors on call who sleep on
the second floor of the dormitory. The main-desk at-
tendant monitors the tunnel entrance‘ by camera and
hospital employees have keys to the door.

If the hospital is unwilling to force their people to_

use the main door, Pitt should limit the tunnel’s.use

to medical personnel only.  list could «be drawn up .
naming frequent tunnel users and a" different, easily

recognizable identification could be issued to the
doctors. It_ is no secret that it is easy to beat the

camera. As an experiment, Brian Keemer, director of ’
the Lothrop Security Committee, switched iden-,
-tification with a friend, gained entrance with the im-

proper I.D., then watched the friend come in right
behind him using no I.D. Nothing ‘was said or done.
Security gaps with the other doorways could be
plugged as well. The loading dock entrance should be
locked when not in.use. The two Victoria Building
routes should be checked to determine just how

necessary they really are. The street-level door should

be locked entirely.

What is most disturbing, however, is the apparent g

foreknowledge of security problems on the part of
some Pitt officials; JoAnn Gibbs, assistant director
of the Office of Residence Life, told The Pitt News:

“The Lothrop desk is one of the worst situations we
have.” Gibbs went on to explain the problems caused
by the glass partition that separates the attendent

“ I Page 6¥Wednesday,,October 13, 1973

from residents as they present identification. She
admits that the attendent has a difficult time
monitoring the door.

“I think it’s (improvement in the system) possible,
but it’s going to take a little work,” said Gibbs.
Whatever it ta-kes must be done. Review and
necessary revisions of the security system of all dor-
mitories, not just Lothrop Hall, should be
periodically conducted. Such investigations cannot
wait until after unfortunate incidents occur.

Tightened security might not be the cure for these
attacks. There is always someone who can beat the
system, but it should not be made any easier for such
a person. Only some arrestsiwill relieve the current
wave of. tension. But students .must work to protect
oneanother. Police urge residents to call them if they

spot suspicious, unfamiliar characters. Contacting '

authorities, and taking a personal interest in the safety

of one’s' neighbors‘ is a better alternative than hall- '
patrols, bathrooms with locks and living in physical

and emotional fear. , V - .

"By JOHN HESS

In early September Jimmy Carter,

A ~ Menachem Begin and Anwar Sadat
' came together at the Camp

 Q David talks and negotiated a sepa-
, I V rate peace between Israel and
L . Egypt, in an attempt to end 30 years

of war in the Middle-East. Following
the negotiations, Secretary of State

. Cyrus Vance ﬂew to Saudi Arabia,

-Jordan and Syria in an effort to

. » include these countries in the peace
 settlements. -

But he was not successful. The
talks were condemned by the

' Palestinians, other Arab countries

 and the majority of people

throughout the world. Why? After

30 years of war shouldn’t any

attempt for peace be applauded?
Yes, if the negotiations are

 genuine. But the Middle-East wars

that have been waged for the last 30

- years always have been in response

to Israeli expansionism, which

began with the swallowing up of
Palestine. To talk about peace and
not include the Palestinians is
ludicrous. As long as Israel
continues to occupy their land, there
never will be peace in the
Middle-East. —

At the talks Sadat claimed to be

- representing Palestininan interests.

This was not necessary since the
Palestinian people have their own

-representatives, the Palestinian

Liberation Organization. Only ne-
gotiations that include the PLO can
be considered genuine steps toward
peace. All others are an attempt
from the beginning to undermine
legitimate representation of the
Palestinians. the PLO always has
represented Palestinian interests
and, for nearly 15 years, has been
helping the people by building
schools and health care centers,
providing employment, and waging
armed struggle to regain occupied
Palestine.

Israel won't negotiate with the

Camp David’sLack of Palestinians

PLO-because they consider them a

danger to the state of Israel. they are
a danger—they are fighting to
regain Palestine and set up a secular
state in place of the present Jewish
state. _

But what's wrong with a secular
state? Isn't that what we have in the
United States? If America were to
change and become a religious

state, there would be quite an_

uproar. Why should Palestine be any
different? Religion is a private
matter, which should not be imposed

on people by the state or used as a

criterion for citizenship in a
particular country. ‘

The PLO was not present as the
Camp David talks. And any other
representative chosen by Israel, the
United States and other parties will
not be interested in Palestinian
rights. They will be acting as a
puppet, that is, securing Israeli and
U.S. interests, which are in direct
opposition to Palestinian interests.
At Camp David Sadat claimed to

represent the Palestinians; let’s see

how the negotiations benefit the

Palestinians. .
First is the question of.Israeli

' expansionism. Has it ceased? Well,

Israel agreed to remove all
settlements in the Sinai. Good for
the Egyptians. for the Palestinians it

has agreed to stop putting up new

settlements for three months. And
then, Israel is free to create as many
settlements as it wants. From 1935
till 1947 the - Zionists brought
thousands of settlers to Palestine,
while running tens of thousands of
Palestinians off their land, by 1947
they constituted one-third of the
population and were given 56
percent of the land (granted by the

. United Nations). .

In the negotiations, Israel insisted
on the need for a ﬁve-year transition
period before the Palestinians could
gain autonomy over the West: Bank
and Gaza. But why ﬁve years?

Wouldn’t six months be more than ’

sufficient?

Certainly. But ﬁve years gives
Israel the necessary time it needs to
create enough settlements so that
giving Palestinians autonomy in the
West Bank would not only
“endanger the security of Israel,”
but also would be unfair to the
non-Palestinian residents — that is,
“imported Israelis” in the region.
In other words, this is another
attempt by Israel at genocide of the
Palestinian nation. I

Some may say this is unnecessary
pessimism and that Israel has no
such intentions. In that case, let’s
continue the examination of the
settlement. At the end of ﬁve years,
it gives national autonomy to the
Palestinians in-the West Bank and
Gaza. What is national autonomy?
It means the people of an area have
control over certain affairs, they
elect officials and set up schools,
but aren’t allowed to operate as an
independent nation. At the end of
the transition period, Israel ‘wants to
maintain a military presence in the

‘West Bank and Gaza to ensure

Israeli security.

So what does it mean for the I

Palestinians? To begin with, it only
gives national autonomy to Pales-
tinians living in the designated
regions. During the last 30 years,
Israel has succeeded in running
many Palestinians out of Palestine
and into Lebanon, Syria, Jordan and
other Arab-countries. This program
has no provisions for Palestinians
displaced anywhere except in the
West Bank and Gaza.

In essence, “it is trying to ensure
that Palestinians never will be

V reunited as a nation, and that those

living in the West Bank and Gaza
never will, have the rights of

politically independent nation.‘

Israel claims a politically independ-
ent Palestinian nation is detri-
mental to Israeli securit. What
about Palestinian security? Israeli
policy must be questioned ’when
secure borders means the genocide
of an entire nation. 4

For more than 30 years Israel has

been trying to exterminate the -

Palestinians. With barely the
passing of one month since the

talks, Israel on October 5, once I

again began attacking the Palestin-
ians with the shelling of the
Palestinian refugee shelter north of
Beruit. These continual attacks are
compounded with the psychological
genocide they wage.

Since 1948, when it gained
statehood, Israel has been trying to
convince the world that the
Palestinians never existed as a
nation. All this fuss about national
homeland is only a response to Arab
“anti-semitism.” Certainly, it
would be very convenient for Israel
if the Palestinians would assimilate
into other Arab countries. But try as
they may to change history, the
facts remain. Zionists came to
Palestine in the _20th century,

systematically tried toiwipe out the :7

Palestinians, then claimed they

 Third Choice in NovemberElections  

The September 25 -Pitt News
editorial entitled “Need for Subst-
ance in the Race for Governor”
decries the lack of seriousness with
which the Democratic and Republi-
can candidates for governor are
taking the problems facing Pennsyl-
vania voters, especially students,
and calls for a full discussion of the
substantive issues in a free and
open debate. The Pitt ‘Young
Socialist Alliance ‘agrees. If you
consider only the Democrat and

5 Republican, there will be precious

little choice this November. As one
reporter wrote for the Pittsburgh
Post-Gazette after a recent so-called
debate between the two candidates,

“Flaherty and Thornbuggh sound‘
more like running mates than
opponents. ’ ’

But there is a choice this
November, one which the Pitt YSA
supports. -And it is unfortunate
that The Pitt News did not mention
Mark Zola, Socialist‘ Workers
candidate for governor, in its
editorial. The editorial would have
been a lot different if‘ you had. For
in no way does Mark Zola resemble
the political twins he is running
against. A Pittsburgh steelworker,
Zola, along with his running mate,
Naomi Berman, A Philadelphia
secretary, stands on a platform that
speaks to and meets the needs of the

.working people of Pennsylvania-

and that is the_vast majority of us.

The socialist platform calls for
taxing the corporations, eliminating
all taxes on peoples homes and
eliminating the sales tax. If the big

businesses in Pennsylvania were
taxed according to their income and
assets as vigorously as we are, there
would never again be heart from
Harrisburg the cry of ‘ ‘no funds’ ’ or
“Not enough money” for education
or any other social program.

The socialist candidates call for
shortening the work week with no
cut in pay to spread the available
work around, and for launching a

_ huge public works program at union

wages to put people to work
rebuilding the cities. Funding for
thiseffort could easily come from
the Pentagon’s playtoy and war
game budget of $126 billion. Zola
and Berman vocally and actively
support extension of the deadline

Elements of a War-Hawk Faction

Regarding the AP story on
Brzezinski, Schlesinger, Jackson

and other elements of a war-hawk‘ ‘

faction bamboozling our govern-
ment (Sept. 25, 1978):

The real story 1S much thicker,
and the contrived shallowness of the
AP story indicates how thoroughly
that international news wire service
is biased. It serves to spread
mythologies and half-truths while
the ignorant readers are al1-believ-
ing. It is dangerous.

The transfer of technology

argued against by these paranoid -

schizophrenics is sophisticated and
extremely sensitive—-‘much as the
intricate technologies of a dish-
washer! This is absurd to imagine
the U.S.S.R. has not developed
more sophisticated technologies in
the process of their fusion research-
es.

Science historically has been an
excellent diplomatic tool when used
properly. If two ‘sovereign nations

can find common ‘interests, then this —
should be capitalized on. The truly ‘

sovereign nation is concerned with
advancing the living standards of its
people and securing a prosperous
posterity. ‘ "

Historically, also, science has
provided a military defense of that
same nation to insure the ability of
that‘ nation to continue in develop-
ment and export of science and a
-better way. In truly free societies,
science is encouraged, and new
ideas are welcome if they can stand
the test of constitutionality and
time.

The struggle of nations to secure a
scientiﬁcally, industrially develop-
ing economy will be fought against
it historically always has been fought
against by monetarists and evil,
mentally disturbed men who are

. manipulated by stronger (richer and

more powerful) evil men.

Any person who does not admit
that this" force of: evil exists and
continues to exist, is playing stupid,

or creating “defense mechanisms”

that even the person is unable to
consciously’ examine. _ _

The IMF and Willy Brandt’s
Commission, and McNamara’s
World Bank, and’ every other foul
connection to these inter/nation
loan-sharks, and the war-hawk
Zionist Lobby faction (most con-

never existed. , In 1969 Golda Meir
(former prime tminister of Israel)
said in the London Times, “there
were no such things as Palestinians.
It was not as though there were a
Palestinian people and we came and
threw them out and took their

_ country away from them. They did

not exist.” , '

So what does the signing of a
peace treaty mean? It clearly does

not stop Israeli expansionism nor do I

the Israeli’s try to ‘make such

Q claims. Yet their expansionism is

the root of the whole problem. The
Palestinians have denounced the
peace settlement for the fraud that
it is. Sham peace proposals only will
prolong war. Genuine peace in the
Middle-east only can: come when
the full rights of a nation are
restored to Palestinians and Israeli
expansionism is halted perm-
anently.

ByJOHN RIGHEITI \

- ‘Angel City.

Directed by Jed Harris L

i A  Express

I t  Sam Shepard’s “Angel City” is about American myths, legends, and V"

‘r__h:;"eams—more speciﬁcally, the movies.

a . " f‘ _ ‘.-‘Angel City’ ’. is a comedy-satire on the American movie industry and
_" 5 n excellent one at that. Staged in an- ofﬁce in Los Angeles, the story

centers on two movie moguls, partners in a large company that has sunk

. , 1 -.-$8 million in debton its latest disaster picture‘. Unnerved, they have sent

.  fo.r‘Rabbit, the talisman-clad, magical idea man who is to lead them from .
. ‘ﬁmisfortune "with the greatest spectacle Hollywood has seen. it is the

L? niiost horrible character ever invented, one that will send audiences‘

. this
disaster movie the most disastrous ever. V
" Here Rabbit's problem arises. How does he imagine a creature; a

j. thing horrible beyond imagination? He and two others, trapped within
"f:thé'ofﬁce by the maniacal moguls, get to work trying to create the »
; disaster to end all disasters.

In the process, a variety of strange occurences expose the characters
for what they really are or, rather, what they always have wanted to be in

_ the movies. Lanx, one of the moguls, is transformed into a prizeﬁghter;
: Tympani, a drummer, becomes a diner operator; and Miss Scoons, the

sensual secretary, gets into the habit of being a nun. Only Rabbit
remains the same.
Wheeler, the second movie boss, experiences the greatest

“transformation of all. The small, meek, bow-tied/ businessman

deteriorates as the time it takes his employees to create the ultimate
disaster lengthens. He is dying financially and, in the movie industry,
that is as good as dying physically. In a short time he has decayed into a
green-skinned, overbearing monster. ‘

Wheeler continually checks the ofﬁce ‘ ‘picture’ ’ window to see if Angel
City has changed, and indeed it has. Seen through the eyes of a dying
monster, it no longer has its former glory. _

Driven by his decadence, he sets Rabbit before the window. All grows
black, and the window becomes a neon movie screen as Wheeler
narrates his ultimate disaster ﬁlm for Rabbit in hopes it will spur him to.
create the horrid character. At the conclusion of the ﬁlm footage, Rabbit
turns around to reveal himself as a monster as well. The most horrid

/creation ﬁnally is exposed: man and his greed.

Despite the seemingly heavy subject matter, “Angel City” is loaded

with bright, hysterical moments of comedy. All the jokes and one-liners

are sharp and obvious. It is the obviousness that tells the audience this is
satire. But exaggeration plays a large part, too, particularly in the many
monologues and movie scenes. The comedy and drama offset each other
so perfectly that the audience never is bored with one or the other.
Aside from the surface comedy level, ‘ ‘Angel City’ ’ has a deeper level
of social comment. it shows how movies have pervaded American lives,
from the youngest to oldest, until life and the movies are virtually one in

"the same. Life is the movies and the movies are life.

_The cast in “Angel City” is tremendous. Barry Plumlee is a

A convincing, Bogartish Rabbit, and Christopher Cooke is the epitome of _
‘the fast-talking businessman as Lanx. J. Lawrence Smith is a
temperamental, powerful Tympani, while Tom Spinella portrays the

Jekyll-and-Hyde Wheeler both sheepishly and demandingly.

Top acting honors, however, go to Susan Cash in the role of Miss
Scoons. Her ability to portray accurately and comically both the
seductive secretary and an Irish nun prove her to be a qualiﬁed actress.

“Angel City" is perfect for a college audience. The play is about us and

our ridiculous attachment to “the picture show.” That ridiculousness
makes it horrendously funny.

Good Album from Ronstadt

By KEITH BRIAN
Living in the U.S.A.

Linda Ronstadt
Asylum

Linda Ronstadt reaches through

time from a 1934 Hammerstein and ,

Romberg tune, “When I Grow too
Old To Dream,” across 44 years to

J .D. Souther’s “White Rhythm and
Blues” as part of her latest album,
“Livingln the U.S.A.”

In the Ronstadt version of the ’34
classic, Don Grolnick on piano ‘and
Mike Mainieri on vibesblend ‘their
instruments like clean ‘air and
sunshine. "

In 1956, Elvis Presley recorded
“Love Me Tender” to win the

hearts of every woman in America.
Ronstadt must have been one ‘of
them, and now with her sweet voice
singing, the same lines, todayls
male population may swoon (if they
haven’t yet).

Miracles had .a hit in 1965 with \

 Wouk's "War and Remembrance" Compelling Tale

By PATTY TASCARELLA

» War and Remembrance

By Herman Wonk

:  Little, Brown

“War and Remembrance“ is
Herman Wouk’s sequel to his 1973

f “The. Winds of War” and carries
L"  a‘ Navy careerman Pug Henry and his
 ‘ f family through World War II. The

new work is a better book, despite

A '- continuing with several of the ﬂaws
' that marks “Winds of War”——most

I" I 3notably the

inane monologues
-pfuttered‘ by Pug’s shallow wife,
-:,,Rhoda: (v‘.‘~Oh, Pug, Madeleine is a

A - f_t.tgJc1oUs girl, and I'm justa hag”).

keeps his name dropping to a
comparative minimum (the first
Henry saga had Pug consorting with
Roosevelt, W. Somerset Maugham,
Herman Goering, Benito Mussolini
and Adolf Hitler).

As “War and Remembrance”

opens, Pug’s personal life is ﬁlled

with problems. Rhoda admits her
affair with a long-time family friend
and requests a divorce after 25 years
of marriage. That isn't too bad in
itself because Pug has been carrying
on with an attractive English girl in
her mid 20’s,- but still, the
complications abound. His daugh-
ter, Madeleine, is having an affair
with her employer, a slimy radio
personality, and is being named
correspondent in -a messy divorce

son, Warren, is a“pilot operating in
the thick of the Paciﬁc air combat.
Hips; younger son, Byron, is still

le\st'ra”n’ged‘ from" the ‘ fainily(also

unclearly explained), because his
wife, Natalie, and infant son are
trapped in fascist Italy with her
uncle, Aaron Jastrow. Jastrow is a
famous author who believes his
position in the literary world
exempts him from Nazi laws, even
though he was a former rabbinical
student.

Wouk then splits the story into
separate perspectives-—Pug’s and
Natalie’s——further fragmented by
segments devoted to Rhoda, Warren
and his wife, Janice, Madeleine, and
Byron. Juxtaposed with these are
Pug’s translations of Nazi docu-
ments by German Gen. Armin van
Roon V and the manuscript from
Jastrow’s last book, “A Jew’s

. Journey."
suit ﬁled byghis wife. Pug’s oldest_

By far, the best sections «-are the
ones dealing with Byron and Natalie.
Although Wonk distorts Natalie to
superhuman dimensions, making it

all 1 the“‘niore unbelievable" why" ‘she '

would not take any of the escape
plans offered, their devotion-‘-de
spite years of separation—is drawn

‘out beautifully. However, both seem

more real when separated; the two
reunions, one in the French
apartment where Natalie is staying
and the other in a Red Cross camp
after the war, are anticlimactic.

Byron is particularly vivid when ,

viewed through the context of his
family. He's a younger, ‘more
passionate edition of his father as his
moral outrage rises to the point
where he belts Madeleine's lover in
the mouth, ruining his meticulously
capped teeth, and his almost affair
with Janice, following Warren's
death, _is extremely touching.
Warren, a shadowy ﬁgure in both

..books, is the indirect cause for some
‘of the _mos_t poignant scenes. Pug,

Wouk’s biggest accomplishment
in “War
however, is the scenes when Natalie
and J astrow are interned in Terezin.

Not so much for plot, for it has been _

told so many times, but for style.
Wouk writes with a surrealand
eerie detachment. They are more
effective than the stilted horror
prose of, say, Gerald Green’s~ book
“Holocaust” (which has triggered
the publication of hundreds of
similar books) or any of the Leon Uris
books (“Mila 18,” “Armaged-

don,” and “Exodus,” which seem ‘

to give Uris a literary patent on Nazi
atrocities). There is a curious control

Ronstadt Spcins Forty oi Music in Ne5vv,A|bu1

(Continued from page 8)
years later, Ronstadt takes a stab at
soul and scores a hit. David
Sanbom’s alto sax cries softly
along in the spaces left without
words. It may not‘ reach the charts

on WAMO, but who cares?
The next stop on the time tour is

1968’s “Just One Look,” then a
seven-year jump to Eric Kaz’s “I’m
Blowin’ Away,” retitled “Blowin’
Away.” The pedal steel guitar of
Dan Dougmore gives a soothing
wind sound similar to a synthes-
izer. The same year’s composition,
“All that You Dream” from Little

Feat’s Bill Payne and ‘Paul Barrere,
took Grolnick to the electric‘
keyboard, putting more power to
the music.

Moving through time, a different
Elvis...Costello...sang a hit- song
called ‘ ‘Allison. ’ ’ Comparing ‘ the
two recordings, Ronstadt is easier

to listen to, but Costello seems
to mean it more. ,

That brings the album to 1978's
“White Rhythm and Blues.” This
songiwas made for Ronstadt. Her
voice ﬁlls every hollow spot created
in Southers network of music. The
lyrics are potent blues, but they

-3 Despite a subpar performance
 against Notre Dame, the“ Pitt
defensive unit can find solace in
‘knowing that it had a better game
than ‘Florida State had last
‘ Saturday against‘ Mississippi State.
3 When the two teams square off
in" ‘Pitt Stadium Saturday, the
i expected Homecoming crowd of
3 $0,000 will see two defenses that
 ‘yielded 988 total_ yards last week,
, including ‘596 through the air.

J “ The Seminoles dropped out of
1 the: Top 20 for the first time this
season after the loss to Mississippi
-(State, 55-27."

“We got stomped,” said head

coach Bobby Bowden. “We’re just
_not‘ playing good football right now.
" Weiare not as good a team as we
nwere in September.”
'_ -Head coach Jackie Sherrill hopes
 squad can aid the Seminoles’
 deterioration and right itself before
the season becomes a disaster.

. “We could be No. 4 in the
coiintry and in the driver's seat for
‘ a major bowl bid,” said Sherrill.
S V“Now we have to fight back and get
V in the picture again.” Pitt dropped
' i I to 15th, place in both wire-service

polls.

In viewing the Notre Dame films,

defensive line coach Pat Jones
, found little enjoyment in the last 14_

minutes of the game.

"There were two things that
= really disturbed us,” said Jones.

‘  “The first thing was Notre Dame's

86-yard drive; we didn’t think any

1 team could stick it down our throats

 
  

 
 

_~I.argie scored 22 minutes into the’

Before the close of the ﬁrst half,
the Panther midﬁelder Johnny
‘O'Hara scored on a direct kick;
Pitt’s first score on a directkick this
season. 0’Hara’s shot sent the
Panthers into the locker room tied at
1-1.

Coming back in the second half,
Davis and Elkins found the goal
again when Mike Riordan put the
team ahead 2-1. Although 18
minutes remained in the game, the
Panthers were unable to counter-
attack and the game ended with
Davis and Elkins on top, 2-1.

like that. The second thing is when
our backs are to the wall, we need
someone to come to the front ‘and
make a'big play.” * ‘-

There has been speculation that
the coaches have been contemplat-
ing a -personnel’ switch in the
defensive secondary. One rumor
has Jeff Delaney moving over to
free safety, with Carlton William-
son playing strong safety; JoJo
Heath would remain at one
comerback spot and ‘Lynn ‘Thomas
would replace Willie Marsh at the
other. Jones wasn’t confirming or
denying ‘anything.

‘‘If we do make a switch, let’s let
Florida State ﬁnd out about it
ﬁrst,” Jones said. ~

Noticeably absent throughout

' the Notre Dame game was the Pitt
‘pass rush, and ‘Jones was asked if

the Panthers considered ‘blitzing
more against Florida State.
“This_is the strategy we use:
defend against‘ a goodpasser, and
rush the hell out of a poor one,”
said Jones. “The Florida State

quarterbacks set up about 12 yards ‘- 

behind the line of scrimmage, so
even if we run a’ linebacker through ‘
untouched, they’ll still have time to
get it off.”

Bowden undoubtedly saw areas
of the Pitt defense that can be
attacked successfully, but he is also
wary of what Sherrill spotted in the
Florida State ﬁlms.

“We see some things that will
work against Pitt if we can execute
them,” said Bowden, “but I’m
sure they’re licking their chops,

(Continued on page 14) ‘

Panther coach Leo Bemis be-

lieved the team played tough,
although it was unable to mount any
offense.
. “We just weren’t able to mount
an attac ,” said Bemis. “We
passed well but didn't
enough. We did an excellent job
defensively, ‘even though we
weren’t able to establish control at
midfield.”

The Panthers were outshot in the
game, which turned out to be as
physical as expected.

“They’re always ready and always

Panther fullback Mark Nigh was
injured in the first half and sent to

the hospital. Nigh received a badly,
‘bruised sternum but may well be in

action -against Edinboro.

‘ ‘Pitt has an excellent team which
was very balanced and organized,”

posed a question for Bemis, who has
decided to alternate ‘John Bonessi,

Successful. Disappointing.

Pitt’s Predictable Hockey Panthers: 111e Sixth Go Round

Typical. Shocking.

 

p ‘All describe various ingredients that went into last
1 V-‘year's Pitt hockey season, the Panther’s fifth.

final game when head coach Len Barcalow died of
cancer. Barcalow, who, for all but the last three

months of his 69 years, seemed as young as a freshly
laid egg, was forced from behind the Pitt bench in

the team’s foundation already established, Bob
Montgomery, Barcalow’s assistant, finished out
another winning season for Pitt.

Which gives transition for the typical. In their five
years on skates, the Panthers have yet’ to understand
the meaning of a losing season. The always-confident
Barcalow, who, before the l977-78 season, said, ‘‘I
ain’t in this (game) to lose,” again was not disap-
pointed. Despite losing more games in a single season

than ever before, the Panthers compiled a 14-'9-l
‘ record, raising the club’s career total to "/3-26-6.

Not before a sputtering start, however; Pitt lost
ijffour of its first five games. Most perplexing was that
«-Barcalow employed the same basic lineup as the year

before. However, the acquisition of two new goalies,

 P Lkich Cunningham and freshman Tom Slivka, disrup-

ted the system somewhat and was partially respon-
sible for the team’s early troubles. Cunningham, who
later would leave the Pitt scene as quickly as he en-

tered it, was in net for Pitt’s first two losses—5-3 to.

Bowling Green and 15-2 at Miami (Ohio)—and
Slivka, having a hard time adjusting, went 2-3 in his
first five starts. ' —A

“Sure we’re ashamed of our record thus far,”
Barcalow said-as Pitt’s record stood at 2-4. “But then
again, we've played some tough teams (losing to
Bowling Green, Princeton and twice to Miami and
beating Virginia and Pennsylvania)...i’m ,confident
we’1l win our next one.”

The Panthers, in fact, won their next four and
were 6-4, by Christmas. Slivka, who soon settled
down, and veteran Larry Newell reinforced the goalie
position, while skaters Curt I-ietz, Larry Gallick and

Tom Sherwin began scoring goals and making the

plays.‘

1

By early March- Pitt was 12-7 and needed only a tie
in its final five games to clinch another winning

’ season. A 4-4 score in Annapolisagainst Navy (san.-

dwiched between two losses) guaranteed just that,
then a pair of season-ending victories pushed the
Panthers five games over .500 for the year.

For the fifth straight season, the hockey club was
successful—but only on the ice.lAlso redundant were
the club’s disappointing efforts , around the
bargaining table.‘ A combination of University red
tape, administrative apathy and Title IX left the Pan-
thers with only an ice-thin budget, no different than
what they had become accustomed to.

Each year, however,‘ club members are given
reason for hope. Promises from the University
Athletic Committee provided last year’s optimism,
but it was unfounded. Again, the hockey club
needed to rely upon a slim allocation from Student
Government. 1

This season, which begins Nov. 8, should be no‘

different. Pitt’s hockey Panthers, coached by Mont-
gomery and newcomer John Schuster, will win more
games than they lose and, after season-long op-
timism, will not receive University backing—for the
sixth time. ‘

  Pantherette Harriers Bounce Back    

By SUEMcFARLAND
Pitt News Staff Writer

Pitt’s women’s cross country
team was back on the road of victory
last weekend with a 21-34 win over
Indiana University of Pennsylvania.

The Pantherettes captured the

three top positions despite unfavor-
able conditions at the Indiana
course.
\ Margie Lee finished first with a
time of 20:01, followed closely by
Brenda Chorpenning with a time of
20:02. Diane Miller placed third with
20:29. ‘ _

Pitt coach Alfreeda Goff was upset
with the team’s performance at
Bucknell last Saturday, and said
then the women lacked both the
conﬁdence and the.desire to work as
a team. '2

‘ ‘We laid it on the line last week at
practice exactly what we expected
from all of the girls and what we
knew they had the ability to do,”
Goff said. “We also had slide
presentations so they could see what

their mistakes were, rather than just
having us tell them. I really think this
helped a lot.”

Goff added that the Pantherettes
had been “getting mentally pre-
pared” for the IUP meet.

“The girls did a lot of talking
among themselves trying to get it all
together for this weekend,” ,she
said. “They realized they couldn’t
depend on anyone else on the team,
but they each had to do their own
part.” A

The Pantherettes are young-and
inexperienced compared to many of
their opponents. Goff said the lack of
experience shouldn't have much
effect on the team since there is little
difference between high school and
college cross country.

“Our biggest problem ‘this year
has not been their lack of experience
but rather lack of conﬁdence,” Goff
said. “We knew that this problem
was not physical because they are all
well-trained athletes. It was a
mental problem.”

Goff was pleased with the team’s

improvement.
‘ ‘I was so pleased at Indiana when
I could actually hear the girls talking

to each other and encouraging each .V V

other while they were running the
race,” Goff said. ~ _
Today, the Pantherettes host

Slippery Rock at 1 p.m. on the

Schenley Park course.

“We will really have our hands
full with Slippery Rock,” Goff "said,
“We met them earlier this year at
the California State Invitational
where they placed ﬁrs .”

This Sunday Pitt will host the 

annual Pitt Invitational, which
involves the top teams in the East.

Penn State and Maryland, one and

two in the nation last year, will pose
the stiffest competition, according to
Goff.

“We’re hoping at this point that

-we can place in the top three, but
we’ll just have to wait and see how.

the girls perform against Slippery
Rock.”

to Panther M idwestem Curse

Fisette. “Even so, I’d say we were
ready to play against‘ Brown.”

Pitt has six All-East players in
the starting ‘lineup, but after the
front-line players, the talent drops
off markedly. As aresult, fouls are
especially dangerous to the Panth-
ers.

In the ﬁnal‘-minutes of the Brown
contest, the Panthers had Mike
Mere, Papo Ruiz and Barry Ford on

the race, including Edinboro,
Bucknell, Hagerstown and Penn
State,"which easily -won the team'
title. John Zielgler of the host team
ﬁnished ﬁrst" in the individual
competition.

Pitt coaches Mike Agostinella
and Mel Boyd said the team has
made progress since its last meet,
the Eastern Eight race at Villinova.

“We’re‘ deﬁnitely pleased with
said
Boyd. ,“‘In particular Studnicki and
Moore ran" really good races and
most everyone I moved up time-
wise.”

The harriers take to the hills of ,

States Track and Field Federation
meet in Morgantown.

the bench as a result of \foul
disqualifications.

‘ ‘Except for the last few minutes,
we played pretty well against
Brown,” said Fisette. “If we had
won that match, we would have
won two others.”

After a .three hour break, Pitt_
returned to the pool to battle
Chicago Circle. Circle had the
advantage of not‘ having ‘played a
match before the one with Pitt, and
the added rest took its toll in the
fourth quarter. After staying ‘even
for three quarters, the Panthers
once again fell short at the end and
lost for the second time by a single
goal, 15-14.

Two last minute one-‘goal losses
had a psychological effect on Pitt,
and ‘it showed in the third match
against’ Loyola. The Panthers,
plagued by early foulvtrouble and
sixth-ranked Loyola’s talent, got
swamped, 20-10.

“We played well for a while
against‘ Loyola,” said _Fisette.
“Then a‘ couple things went bad,
and ‘things began to snowball.” ,

George Machicote picked up two
early fouls (three means disqualiﬁ-
cation), and Fisette substituted
Mike Schoﬁeld. Schoﬁeld, the
regular goalie,’ returned to the ﬁeld
for the ﬁrst time this year, while"
Machicote moved to goal.

“Mike's play in the ﬁeld wasthe
highlight of the tournament,?’ said
Fisette. “I had considered
switching ‘the two when Machicote
got into early foul trouble before,
and Mike’s play in the ﬁeld was
encouraging.” ' I I

The Panthers closed out their’

schedule by bowing‘ to Indiana,‘
13-9. Fisette went to the second

line players early, partly because of. I
more foul trouble and partly to rest

his regulars.

“The team -became obsessed 1
with the referees, " said Fisette. “I

was disappointed the team didn’t
have the discipline to forget the

referees and just play polo.”

In addition to the play of
Schoﬁeld, Fisette cited the offens-
ive efforts of Butch Silva as a

positive aspect of an otherwise
disastrous weekend. Fisette. added A

Silva’s defensive effort left a lot to
be desired, however.

A I Pitt News Staff Writer
As important as the Notre Dame

. game .was, Saturday’s game

against Florida State at Pitt
Stadium could be even more

, important,— according to Panther
. offensive guard Matt Carroll.

‘_ “This could be the game of the
year for us,” the senior said.‘ “We
have to bounce back now, or we

A . couldbe in trouble.”

Carroll, a four-year starter and
preseason all-America candidate,
«believes the game means ‘as much

Saturday .by unheralded Missis-
sippi State. Despite that loss,
Carroll takes the Seminoles
seriously. .

“They’re an excellent football
team,” the 6-3, 255 pound senior
said. “They'll give us a good game
Saturday.” -

A loss Saturday would help spoil
what has so far been an enjoyable

season for Carroll, who is having-

‘his best year at Pitt.
Carroll is willing to take part of
the blame for Saturday’s defeat.
“Our pass protection could have

to Florida State, which was upset been better,” he said. “Notre

Dame’s defense was putting a lot of
pressure on Rick.” _

Although sacked only twice, Rick
Trocano had considerably less time
to throw than Irish quarterback Joe
Montana, whose -fourth quarter
passing sparked Notre Dame.

According to Carroll, there was a
reason why that was so.

.“They were giving us a lot more
defensive looks than ‘we were
giving them,” he explained.
“Their linebackers and ends were"
stunting, which allowed them to
get to Rick faster.

“We haven’t'been communicat-
ing well, and it showed Saturday,”
Carroll said about the offensive
line. “Our trouble is that we can’t
get all ﬁve of our linemen to do the
right thing at the same time.

“We’ll have four guys doing the

‘ right thing, and the other one doing

it wrong, and it ends up hurting us.
“We had that happen to us a
couple of times Saturday,” Carroll
added. “What could have been 25;
or 30-yard runs were only‘f1ve or six
because we weren't‘ communicat-

ing.well and all doing the right
thing at the same time.”

Carroll, who believes this year’s
offensive line is as good if not
better than last year’s, blames
inexperience for such mistakes.

“We have a young offensive
line,” said Carroll, the only
returning ‘starter. “Everyone has
given effort, but effort can only

 %PrePare’sfor Piitt’s  meiofttheYear’

take you so far if you don’t have the
experience.”

Believing experience makes the
good offensive lineman great,
Carroll, who is a solid pro prospect,
credits experience with making him
a better lineman.

“I have the ‘same ability I had as
a freshman,” he said. “I just have
more experience now.”

Terry, Lynn
Lead League

By The Associated Press

While the 7-0 Pittsburgh Steelers \

are off to their best start ever, two
team members have a good chance
to win National Football’ League
titles at their respective positions.
Quarterback Terry Bradshaw,
best in the NFL for the’ second
straight week with a 101.8 rating,

_ leads runnerup Joe Ferguson of the
" Buffalo Bills by 15 points, a Steeler -

spokesman said yesterday.

.. Bradshaw leads the league’s
passers with an average of 8.83
yards" per attempt and leads the
league’s American Football Con-
ference with 13 touchdownpasses.

Wide receiver Lynn 'Swann’s 35’

receptions leads. the league this

week and the AFC for the third-

consecutive week. _

With less than half the 16-game
seas_on over, Swann also has a good
chance _of breaking a team record
set by Roy J efferson’s 67 catches in
1969’s 14-game season.

Running back Franco Harris and
place-kicker Roy Gerela are the only

other Steelers near the top in the —

AFC. .
Harris is fourth in the conference

in rushing with 529 yards, while

Gerela is fourth in scoring with 41
points.

The Pitt women’s’volleyball team
entered a “hotbed of volleyball” at
the Houston Invitational last
weekend‘ and‘ emerged without
getting‘ “burned.” The Panther-
ettes placed ﬁfth among‘ the
competitors, who have the ability to
give the California‘ teams a run for
a National‘ Championship.

Texas-Arlington placed first,
Texas A&M came in ‘second,’

Houston ﬁnished third and‘ Oral
Roberts was fourth.

Pitt began ‘pool play with
10th-ranked Houston and‘ lost,
15-10, 15-9. The tide then turned
for the Pantherettes when they
defeated the three other teams in
their pool. Pitt lost the first game
to Tulane,‘ 16-14, but rebounded to
win games two andthree, 15-5,
15-9, andthe match.

Sam Houston State was the next
competition, ‘and’ Pitt won ‘in

The Pantherettes then entered’

while Houston was fourth. And so,
Pitt faced the Cougarettes again
andwere defeated again, ‘15-10,
15-9, which meant ‘a ﬁfth-place tie
with Ohio State.

“Now we know that we are

competitive at the national‘ level,”
said Hebert. “It was a good trip
and’ we got some needed
experience out of it.” V ’

Hebert singled out Maria Perez
for playing “‘a solid tournament,”
but added, “The whole team made
a good recovery after a poor
showing‘ against‘, Cleveland‘ State
last week.” .
