“As far as _I_ know, it’s_ _ thefirst

Sylvia Roberts. '

“There have been some state

Expressing mixed emotions on

the issue, senior psvchologv maior

SheilavTatangell said of the-

remuneration, “It would bother

me, but then again ‘Student
Government is a student activity.”
Fourty-seven per cent of those

students interviewed disapproved
of the pay, and these students were

more outspoken» in defending their

_views.

“Participation in Student Go-

by pay. It takes up time, but that’s
the price they pay for getting what
they want from experience in
student organizationsand political

things,” offered a senior econo
mics major who refused to be
identiﬁed.

Senior Eileen Moffitt echoed this

‘view, stating, “They should realize

when they take office it’s a

expect to’ get paid. Student

stated Johnson and her represen-

Johnson has continued in her

“To be paid is not their reason for -

biochemistry major Greg Boul-

V dakos. -

“I think their learning exper-

be nice if everyone got paid for
learning things.”

Sixty-nine per cent of the
respondents to the survey were
unaware that SGB members were
being paid for their work this
summer. Only 31%, or less than

' one in three, were aware of the

remuneration.

Because the SGB had thought
the Remunerations Board inactive
at this time, they sought and
received their pay from the Office
of Admissions and Student Aid.

‘‘I think Dr. Moye and I are both
miffed that (SC) would demand
parity in a ‘situation such as this,”
said William -Markus, executive
assistant to Moye. “They (SGB)
showed some initiative to try to find
a solution that would allow them -to
stay here the summer.” Markus
added that many SGB members
had to curtail other employment to
work for the organization. .

SGB members received $450

Altogether seven members re-

Scott Julian, business ‘manger

20 hours per week and receives no

According to the-—_University’s
pretrial statement, Johnson’s dis-
missal was based on the irrelvancy
of her programs and teaching to the
mission of the University and the
biochemistry department in parti-

The biochemistry department
was lagging behind. comparable
institutions in other universities,
‘according to Pitt’s pretrial state-

changed to “adjust teaching and

Shadyside Festival with Flair

\

BY LISA RUBEN STEIN

We stood in the doorway of one
of Shadyside’s Walnut Street
specialty shops waiting for the rain
to let up. There were a few people
who, undaunted by the rain,
zigzagged across the road, peering
through the plastic shrouds protec-
ting the etchings and photographs
exhibited at the Shadyside Summer
Arts Festival. Some of the braver
artists donned raincoats and stood
by their booths, exchanging re-
marks‘ with the few bedraggled
spectators.

“This weather is really tough,”
said one of the artists. “It’s
‘practically impossible to sell
anything in this kind of weather.
People just don’t buy if they’re ‘not
feeling good.” '

After all, the artists were there to
sell, and the weather seemed
stacked against them from the
beginning of the festival. The
weather was unbearablv hot and

humid since Thursday, and then on

Sunday the skies opened up.
But when the rain let up, the

artists were ready to show off their
wares. Potters dried off ceramic
bowls and mugs, macrame jewelry
appeared from ‘beneath thick
plastic covers, and photographs

‘ came out of safe, dry corners.

And’ people took the‘ bait.
Pittsburghers crowded Walnut
Street. ‘Coming out from under-

'neath overhangs, they strolled

down Walnut Street while folding
umbrellas. They passed every-
thing from enamel jewelry to
delicate, intricately constructed
copper sculpture.

“Peanuts, get your fresh roasted
peanuts, here. We roast ‘em, we
toast ’em," cried a college student
from Edinboro as he pedaled a
bike to power a homemade peanut
roasting oven.

“How about some homemade
fudge?” asked someone else. “It’s
only 25 cents, and delicious.”

We walked on, between the batik
and the leather work, to stop in
front of a broomsquire. who
provided a running commentary as
he tied and wired special broom-
corn to long wooden poles.

“Yep, I do this for a living,” he 1
said, wiping his hands on his thick
leather apron. “This, and a

40-acre farm outside of Ithaca, New -

York."
“I'd like to take off like that,"

said a young man holding a little‘

boy's hand.

“I started out as an engineer.
All it takes is the guts to leave what
you’re used to.”~

The young man laughed,
“That’s what I’m studying for.”

We walked on, pausing to study
tne burlap and rope hangings. The
rhythmic voice_ of a street-side
magician drew us near. He was
young, and his magician’s tuxedo
consisted of a reasonable t-shirt
facsimile.

The crowd laughed as he duped a
stout gentleman with the “hand is
faster then the eye,” and the
typical magician sponge-ball rou-
tine.

The crowd loved it. A few stayed
around when he ﬁnished his act,
but the majority went off to see

what other unexpected delights -
- could be found.

And there were plenty, from the
soothing sounds of hand-con-
structed thumb pianos and wooden
ﬂutes, to the melodic voices of
Camelot Productions, performing
selections from Camelot and The
Fantastiks.
