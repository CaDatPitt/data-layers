Students   fa ce

housing shortage .

By Michael Ashford
Staff Writer

A rocketing demand for on-
campus housing and a limited
supply of available accommoda-
tions are putting a strain on both
Pitt students and the university
housing system. _

As a result, student complaints
abound while the housing authority
is developing new strategies in an
attempt to deal with the growing
shortage.

Many students and their campus
advisers feel the situation" is not
being adequately addressed. “It’s a
problem of omission on the part of
the university,” said CAS adviser
Timothy Dodd. “There isn’t enough
attention paid to the student's
needs.” Dodd said he received com-
plaints of housing problems from
more than 70 of his students. The
complaints range from criticism of
housing allocation practices to a
lack of vital information.

Donovan Hughes, director of
Housing and Food Services, said
yesterday in an interview that, while
all available units are being filled,
there are no explicit problems with
university policy and practices.

However, returning sophomore

Andy Bacallao said he was misin-_

formed when he applied for on-'
campus» housing last year. After
drawing number 1400 in the upper-
class housing lottery, Bacallao
dropped out of it in February after
being told his chances of receiving

housing were slim. The first 860

drawings received preference.

“I came very close to going to
another school,” Bacallao said.
“That's sad in itself.” Other accounts
tell of students who opted for
another university -,because they
could not be guaranteed on—campus
housing. *

Bacallao now shares what he
called a “roach-infested" three-

' bedroom Oakland apartment with

four other Pitt students. “To pay
$515, per month for an apartment
with broken fixtures and low water
pressure is ridiculous,” he said.
Bacallao, a Philadelphia resident,
said he felt he was forced to take the
apartment because he was running
out of time.

Incoming freshmen face a similar
problem. Unlike many universities,
Pitt does not guarantee housing for
freshmen.

According to Hughes, an esti-
mated 1500 “beds” are reserved,
from the approximate total of 4200,

for incoming freshmen. These are

allotted on a first—come, first-served
basis. '

Until last year, new students fully
matriculated by May ~ 1 who
requested housing were guaranteed
an on-campus unit. But last year the
deadline was moved up to April 24
because of rising admissions.

This year, the cut-off date was
even earlier, according to Hughes.
As he explained, freshmen who
qualify but cannot be assured hous-
ing may choose to be placed on a
waiting list. If these freshmen with
reserved units drop out, names are
drawn from this list.

Freshmen may choose temporary
housing in dormitory lounges if,
after completing the university
housing contract process, no units
can be found for them. Inthe past,
these students received permanent

' units by December, Hughes said.

Freshman Kelly Longenecker
lives in a Tower lounge with three
other first-year women. She con-
tends, however, that she is an excep-
tional case. While in Pittsburgh for
her advising session last July, she
said she and a friend visited Robert
Robinson, a Housing and Food Ser-
vices administrator, at his office.
“We wouldn't have gotten this
[housing] if we hadn’t approached
him," Longenecker said.

ROTC group trains for
Sunday’s ‘Great Race’

Bygobbyismouse
Staff Writer . .

This Sunday a group of Army
ROTC cadets will represent the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh in the ninth
annual running of the Great Race.
The cadets will be led by Battalion
Executive Officer Joe Moore and
will sport “Let’s get physical" T-
shirts. Moore will march in front of
the formation with the Army guidon
while the cadets chant Army
cadences. I

“Army ROTC is basically aca-
demically oriented, but it is also a
physically oriented organization,”
said Lieutenant Colonel Donald
Kirchoffner, professor of military

. _ science at Pitt. “We have physical

training at Trees Hall every Mon-
day, Wednesday and Friday morn-

ing at 6:30 a.m. for all the cadets.”

Last year, it was one of the cadets
who _fII‘St_ got the idea of running a

platoon in the Great Race."
According to Kirchoffner, the run
is just one of many activities that
ROTC is involved in this year.
“We regularly practice field train-
ing exercises, have military balls and

participate in other social activities."

Cadet Officer George Girhiny
said the cadets “will notvbe out to
win the race” but that they are only
expecting to make their presence
known. “We want to show that we
are proud of this city andthat we
support it as we do our country,” he
said. “We should ~do all right,
though, because we’ve all been
through extensive physical
training.”

Over 12,000 other runners are
expected to participate in the

. Citiparks‘-sponsored 10-kilometer

race. The race will start at Frick_
Park in Squirrel Hill at approxi-

'm_ately«9 a.m. A majority of the race
, will take place in the Oakland area

and will ﬁnish at Point State Park.

A group of 10 Indian-born Pitts-

raise $1 million to start an Indian
studies program at Pitt. The,scien-
tists have set a goal to raise the
money and begin the program
within one year.

“We _are approaching scientists

from India to help raise the endow-

Pathology at Pitt’s medical school.
The group is working through the
Telugu Scientists of America, an
association of scientists from the

“India is such a huge country with’
a fascinating culture, and I hope that
Pitt students will be enthusiastic
about the program,” said ‘Burkart

was surprised but terribly pleased
that citizens arose to collect funds
for an Indian studies ‘program here
at Pitt." ’

Holzner accompanied Pitt presi-

SGB offerslegal service

By Michael Adebimpe
For The Pitt News

Pitt's Student Government Board
is promoting a legal service for stu-
dents again this year. The service is
providing legal advice to the stu-

dents regarding their rights, protec-

tion and issues.
The legal service will’ benefit all
undergraduate students. It was the
idea of Pete Petropoulos, a member
of the Student Government Board.
“The program has been successful

' in the past; my goal is to extend the
service,” said‘ Petropoulos. “But you

have to prove that the demand for
legal service is there.”

Many students are currently.tak-
ing advantage of this service by dis-
cussing their problems with attorney
Todd H. Crawford, who visits cam-
pus on.Fridays from 2-4 p.m.

During the sessions, students have _
the opportunity to consult with the
attorney confidentially, about prob-
lems such as landlord/tenant dis-
putes and the legality of various
proposals. ’ ' I

The legal service is free to all

undergraduate day students‘. “It’s a

from humanities to medical and

health technology. The two schools-
wiii also exchange some faculty and I

students. i

“It is at the preliminary stage
now,” Rao said, “but it is a signifi-
cant agreement.” I ‘

Rao, the coordinator of education, -

for the Telugu Scientists of America,
suggested that students majoring in
international business would benefit
from learning more about India.
“Students majoring in international
business, for example, may need to
knowthe culture aswell as the eco-
nomic and scientific background of
the people of India," he said. “We
feel in the future there will be.more
and more students wanting to get
intothis program.” i

little access to free advice,” said‘

Luke Kluchko, president of the Stu-

dent Government Board. “It will be 1
beneficial to students who need legal .

advice but cannot afford to pay an
attorney.” .

Although response to the‘ legal
service has been positive, Kluchko
said he believed some students felt
uncomfortable about discussing
their problems, with Crawford.
Crawford said he wasn’t certain’ of
student reaction, but is curious to
find out. “I hope they feel comforta-
ble about it.”

Mexican president promises aid to victims

MEXICO (UPI) — President
Miquel de la Madrid vows that in
earthquake-ravaged Mexico, “We
will live, and we will rebuild.”

A group 01 homeless tenants who
once lived in a now crumbled apart-
ment complex in Mexico City found
little comfort in Madrid’s promises.
The group said that hundreds of
people who died in last week’s earth-
quakes might have survived if
government authorities had ordered
builders to pour new foundations
for -the apartment buildings. One
tenants’ union planned a march yes-
terday to protest government cor-
ruption and lax building codes.

Rescue teams continue to locate
survivors. The death toll which
includes infants, is nearing 5000.
John Gavin, U.S. ambassador to
Mexico, said he still believes the
death count may reach as high as
10,000. . ‘

‘Six Americans are among the
over 4,000 conﬁrmed dead by the
Mexican government. Gavin added
that 28 Americans are missing and
feared dead. 4

Sunshine linked
to eye cancer

(UPI) — A National Cancer Insti-
tute research study links eye cancer
with exposure to sunshine. The
study suggests that exposure to the
ultraviolet rays of the sun increases‘
the risk of eye tumors, which tend to
spread. Officials say the data suggest
the use of sunglasses may lower the
risk of getting eye cancer. Studies
also found that blue-eyed people
who spend a lot of time in the sun
without eye protection appear to be
at a higher risk.

Reagan discusses
upcoming sum-
mit

WASHINGTON (UPI) -— Presi-
dent Reagan is meeting with Soviet

foreign minister Eduard Shevard-
nadze early‘ today to discuss the

American-Soviet summit, which

will take place in November.

The meeting, in the White House,
is expected to cover a full range of
subjects.as they draw the agenda for
the summit session in Geneva. A
White House aide predicts the dis-
cussions will cover bilateral issues,
arms cont_rol, regional problems and
human rights.

There is a chance that the Soviets
may come up with a new arms con-
trol proposal. The White House has
made it clear, however, that it is not
willing to bargain away the future of
the proposed “Star Wars" program
quite yet.

Reagan renewed a committment
yesterday to what he called “con-
crete progress in arms reduction on a
broad front.”

Wheeling-Pitt . I
denies beneﬁts

CHARLESTON, W. VA. (UPI)
— The state of West Virginia has
denied striking Wheeling-
Pittsburgh Steel Corporation
workers unemployment benefits.
However, Governor Arch Moore
has directed the three-member

Employment Security Board of
Review to appeal the decision.

Moore claimed he took the action
only “moments” after learning that a
three-judge tribunal unanimously
denied the workers’ benefits. The
tribunal’s decision was contained in
a ruling signed earlier this week but
not revealed until yesterday.

Moore asked the board of review
to pay particular attention to a sec-
tion of West Virginia law that grants
exceptions to employees who are
unemployed due to work stoppages.

A Although the state ordinarilydenies

benefits during such stoppages,
according to Moore. he mentioned
exceptions, such as when an
employer shuts down a plant or if
employees are. forced to accept

t wages substantially lower than the

prevailing wages in the area for sim-
ilar work. The governor told the
board to focus on those exceptions
in preparing the appeal.

Wheeling-Pittsburgh workers, on
strike since July 21, claim the com-
pany is locking them out, making
them eligible for «unemployment
benefits. Officials in Ohio and Penn-

sylvania recently granted striking
workers suchbeneﬁts.

Bilingual educa-
tion seen as failure

(UPI) — Education Secretary
William Bennett yesterday pro-
claimed the nation's bilingual educa-
tion system a failure yesterday and
called for a congressional overhaul.

In a prepared speech to be deliver
in New York, Bennett said the high
school dropout rate for Hispanics is
50 percent, double the national aver-
age, and as high as it was before
Congﬁess set up bilingual education.

The law_ requires schools to teach
students in their native language
until they reach a certain level of
proficiency in English. Bennett also
added that many children remain in
classes taught in their native lan-
guage and never become ﬂuent in
English. t

The Reagan administration, Ben-
nett said, wants to give schools more
flexibility so they can place more
emphasis on English. Critics in Con-
gress claim the White House goal is
to get rid of the 17-year-old bilingual
Education Act.

Housing’ a
continued from page 1

According to her account, Robin-
son gave Longenecker and her
friend special consideration in
response to their personal com-
plaints. Longenecker stated that
Robinson emphasized the favor he
was granting them by pointing to a
“large stack of papers on his desk,”
apparently referring to the backlog
of housing applications.

Longenecker, relatively. pleased
with her situation now, said she is
well aware of the problems other
students face and the special atten-
tion she received. ‘‘If you can fit four
people into a lounge, and beds are
that serious a problem,” she ‘said,
“why don’t they convert them all to
rooms?”

According to students’ accounts,
many lounges are not utilized for
recreation.

Other students who were inter-
viewed this week spoke of friends
and‘ acquaintances housed in Car-
low College dormitories. Longe-
necker mentioned a freshman
classmate living off-campus who
was feeling depressed over what she
described as a lack of contact with
other new students. ,

Given the small number of availa-
ble units to date, the prospects for an’
immediate and complete solution to
the problem ‘are poor. Housing
authorities have stated that they are
doing the best they can with the

5. resources at their disposal.

But the problem apparently

began with the words,-‘‘Everyone

nately...popularity has its draw-
backs!" The letter-informed her that
no housing was available, and it
offered her the waiting list option.
“When I got that letter, I was

upset,” she said. “l iwalkedback to’

received that letter, Longenecker
was not contacted again. “They
could have at least told me what

areas to look for an apartment,” she

said.- i‘. _ .
Bacallao was also critical of the

university support services. “They_ .

don’t seem to understand the prob-
lems they {non-Pittsburgh residents]-
face when making a move like that,”

z

 

he said. Bacallao said he got no help
from the Commuter Resource Cen-
ter. He said he felt the university
support services" were “insensitive.”

The Student Government Board
is also planning- to confront the
issue. SGB member Pete Petropou-
los urged students to take action.
“The facts show there is a problem,
but until students voice their con-
cern, nothing can effectively be
done.”-

Strip-Searches

It often seems that there is no respect for youth in this country. American
policymakers appear to delight in trouncing on the individual rights of
American adolescents, routinely advocating and adopting oppressive mea-
sures designed to make American youngsters quake in fear of the law.

Now it comes to light that students are being subjected to the humiliating
ordeal of strip searches conducted by public school teachers. Moreover,

-these searches are being undertaken without first obtaining a warrant or even

parental consent. This comes as a resultof a law passed by the United States

. Supreme Court last January allowing teachers to search students and their

property without a warrant.

Regardless of whether or not law enforcement is among the duties of

‘ American educators, these searches raise grave ethical considerations. We

This is especially true of the American school system, where, in the past,
educators were granted near absolute authority over students. Many abuses v
have been allowed to occur, including corporal punishment. Students have
long been treated as second-class citizens in this respect.

Yes, youth is, by nature, intractable. But the problem of youth should’ be

' dealt with sensibly, with the same mature approach, to problem-solving that

is often unfairly demanded of American adolescents. Brutalizing the rights
of American youth is not only unjust; it is unconstitutional as well.

Biased View .

I'm responding to an article writ-
ten in the Friday, Sept. 20 edition of
The Pitt News’ sports section. I
believe journalist Jim Brueckner is
totally unqualified to critique Larry
Holmes’ boxing career or attempt to
compare it L0 that of ;9<,o<;kv'Marci-

quate knowledge he could have
obtained only through black and
white film clippings, and antiquated
illusionary stories he heard sitting
on his grandfather's lap in the 60s.
For instance, Brueckner suggests
that Marciano would have “dis-
mantled Holmes in ﬁve or six
rounds  if not one,” which is com-
pletely a ﬁgment and suggestion of
his unprofessionally biased imagina-
tion. It is whole-heartedly unjusti-‘V
fied, and illegitimafte. Mr. Brueckner,
i'n._your asymmetrical critique of
Larry Holmes‘ career, you failed to

Larry Merchant, HBO Sports.)This
is a fact -4 something your article
lacked. In essence, Rocky was light-

If indeed The Pitt News wants the
credibility of a pro-collegiate news-
paper, -it better replace the dark
clouds of Brueckner journalism, and
forecast a sunny, impartial, profes-
sionally sound journal that can with-
stand the pressures' of such an
endeavor. In closing, Mr.
Brueckner, God answered your
prayers and Spinks was victorious,

‘Star Wars’

“Simply Speaking" was an
appropriate title for Gerald Stew-
art‘s simple-minded reflections (The

» Pitt News. Sept. 25) on the possible

beneﬁts of Ronnie Rambo‘s “Star
Wars" program. If I can be excused
for treating this heroic feat of
twisted thinking as an argument, it
can be put succinctly — the Russians
think differently about arms control
than we do because their nuclear
policy is to ﬁght and win, rather than
merely to “punish." Consequently
their arguments against Star Wars
can be ignored, and deployment of
Star Wars should go ahead because
itmay convince them to adopt a lesh

  Letters to the Editor

Who has the more aggressive
nuclear policy, the Soviet Union or
the United States? Politically, both
sides publiclymaintain that their
only interest is in avoiding nuclear
war through deterrence. Militarily-,

' the emphasis on both sides is on

nuclear. .weapons, the U.S. consis-

deterrence- ,

“prevailing” in the event that war
breaks out. Stewart’s claim that
only the Russians are interested in
fighting nuclear‘ war is groundless:
,.;,‘:,},,.,. 4]._,¢.1,—-,— _,-.,v, .:,~'..-__.-. »4l.v
nth-‘. Of’,-">‘7‘ '_  * ’:‘ I‘-»" 9-‘mi’
art doesn’t believe this, perhaps he
would like to answer the following:

I. Counterforce targeting, an
essential element of nuclear war
fighting and _a necessity in any first
strike capability, requires large
numbers of highlyaccurate missiles
which need only relatively small
megatonnage. If T only the Russians
plan to fight nuclear war, why it is
that their missiles are, on the whole,
larger; and far less accurate than
those of the U.S. forces? '

2.‘ Why is it that while the Soviet
Union has renounced first use of

tently, refuses to do so? Of course, to

a reactionary ideologue like =Ste- ‘-
* wart,.any such. Russian .pledge ‘is .

merely propaganda. Therefore we
should look more closely at the
actual structure of the forces
involved. NATO openly admits that
it relies on the first use of nuclear
weapons in the European theatre —
that is why it can afford much
smaller conventional forces in
Europe. NATO strategy relies pre-
cisely on the “pre-emptive attacks”
and “close integration [of] general
purpose forces and nuclear forces"
which Stewart would like us to see as
the exclusive domain of the Soviet
Union. '

3. Why is it that virtually every
major innovation in nuclear warfare
(the atom bomb, neutron bomb,
MlRVs, cruise missiles, etc.) was
introduced by the U.S.? Nuclear war
fighting, as opposed to mere “pun-
ishing," depends on technological
superiority — an area where, for 40
years, the U.S. has been pre-empting
the U.S.S.R. *

4. Nuclear war fighting requires
large arsenals, because it is not suffi-
cient to just take out cities; you have
to attack all the silos, planes, subma-
rines, etc. as well — so why is it, if
only the Soviet Union is interested in
fighting, that never once since the
invention of the nuclear bomb has
the Soviet Union enjoyed an across-
the-board numerical advantage over
the U.S. (let alone the combined
forces of the U.S., Britain and
France)?

5. Why is it that the U.S. refuses to
join the Soviet Union in moratori-
ums on weapons testing and anti-
satellite systems testing? .

It is obvious that it is not only the
Russians who are concerned with
prevailing rather than punishing, in
the case of ‘a breakdown of

If Mr. Stewart’s premises are

' wildly false, what about his conclu-

sions? The Russian arguments, it
seems, are not merely self-serving
attempts to preserve a (nonexistent)
first-strike capability. Stewart sug-
gested that Star Wars would prompt

_the Russians to reconsider their

aggressive approach to nuclear war.
Would that it were so — but it is
obvious again that the only reasons-

I--..Y.‘ W .; .,..-,.-,.v,.A.,r:i,,.««t,..
.. :§ . .  t-- -ac ~

increases in the numbers of
offensive weapons. Mr.’ Gorbachev
has said so, adding his to many
respected opinions within this coun-
try. The reason is that a less-than-
perfect_ Star Wars system _is useless
against a first strike, but could be
critical against a retaliatory strike

from a side much-weakened by a ,

first strike against it.Thus Star Wars
is best viewed, along with the MX,
cruise and Pershing missiles and the
anti-satellite weapons currently
being developed by the U.S., as part
of theatternpt to build first-strike
capability- . The . Soviet. response

Lagging Aid
While the University of Pitts-
burgh School of Medicine has one of
the highest tuitions in the United
States, it is in the bottom fifth per-
centile of medical schools when it
. comes to the amount of scholarship
it provides to its students. The mag-
nitude of the difference between the
two numbers — tuitionand scholar-
ship — is the reason why Pitt stu-
dents are the most indebted medical
students at state-supported institu-
tions in this country. -
Assuming that Pitt administra-
tors are aware of this dubious dis-
tinction, you might think university
officials would be motivated to use
the limited resources at their dispos-
al as wisely ‘as possible, so as to serve
the scholarly goals of the School of
Medicine. Why then has Dr. Henry
Bahnson, chairman of the Depart-
ment of Surgery, with the apparent
blessings of Vice President Detre
and President Posvar, been allowed
to spend tens of thousands of dollars
on a public-relations ﬁrm whose
explicit function is to repair the self-
inﬂicted damage incurred by the
School of Medicine's kidney trans-
plant surgeons?

Welfare for the Affluent

No social system could perpetuate
itself if it relied solely on the use of
coercive force. There are many ways
in which a social system is legiti-
mized. Moral justifications have
usually been a refuge for intellectu-
ally bankrupt ideologues and apolo-
gists, especially when faced with
sharp critical attacks which have
forced them on the defensive. In an
editorial not too longago, The Wall
Street Journal bewilderingly com-
mented that “despite its obvious suc-
cess at
alleviating poverty; capitalism con-

- tinues to grope for a moral justifica-

tion." In its less than self-conscious
way, The Wall Street Journal’s
pique. raises two important ques-
tions: First, to what extent is the
premise accurate, especially the last
part — that capitalism has mitigated
poverty? Second, for whom does it
require a moral justification?

Few can argue the proposition
that capitalism has produced great
wealth. Even the Marxists concede
this point. The real issue, however, is
the distribution of wealth. What we
have in'America is/a political econ-
omy which concentrates the wealth
that is socially‘ generated. Despite
the robust recovery in 1984, the bot-
tom 40 percent of American families
claimed only 15.7 percent of the
nation's income, down from 15.8 in
1983. Meanwhile, the top 40 percent
of American families received 67.3
percent up from 67.1 percent in
1983. This represents the highest
concentration ever recorded.

Even after a period of .economic
growth and a 0.9 percent reduction

of families in officially-defined pov- .

erty (from 15.3 percent to 14.4 per-
cent) in 1984, more people remain in
poverty now than at any time since
1966, with the exception of two
other years during the Reagan pre-
sidency, in 1982 and 1983. In busi-
ness cycle terms, the 0.9 percent

Militarism

. Thank you, Michael Ashford_(“A'
Process of Militarization in Amer-
ica,”w.Sept. 23). Ashford effectively

, challenges us with a beautifully con-

ceived 'and. soundly executed criti-
cism of militarism in.AAmerica.

.1 must say,,.however, that thelast
paragraph seemed toneutralize the

generating wealth and _

reduction is not unprecedented dur-
ing upturns and is roughly equiva-
lent to the amount by which poverty
tolls have been increasing annually.
It is difficult to anticipate further
reductions in poverty as the econ-
omy shows signs of weakness.

In spite of President Reagan’s
hyperbole that the reduction in pov-
erty is “further proof that the great-
est enemy of poverty is the
free-enterprise system," it is clear
that the trickle-down effect has
stopped well short of a significant
proportion of poor Americans.
Though the poverty rate among
households headed by women fell
slightly, 34.1 percent of these fami-
lies remain impoverished. The
number of poor children increased
by three million from 1968 to 1983,
even though during this period the
total number of children decreased
by nine million. While we -‘must
allow for so-called demographic
considerations of births to unwed
mothers and increasednumber of
households headed by women (who
on the average earn less than 60 per-
cent of what their male counterparts
earn), it is r.
tion. The ,ongressional Budget
Office reported‘ that benefits for
poor children have dropped by $290
each since 1976, and in 1983 were the
lowest since 1974, with the exception
of 1982. Benefits for children of poor
families are likely to continue to
decline, since 60 percent of the Rea-
gan administration_’s budget cuts are

. aimed at the six percent of the

budget that involves transfer pay-
ments and welfare programs.
Besides these abominable ‘facts,
the decline of the middle class is a
grave political consequence. Middle

class households, commonly defined -

as those with incomes between 75
and 125 percent of the median
income, have fallen from 28.2 per-
cent of the population in 1967 to

impetus and power generated by the
preceding 10 paragraphs. After tak-
ing us on a forceful roller coaster
ride of penetrating criticism, we are

‘left in a tentative lurch; .

"Ashford says, “It is unlikely that
any of these institutions will change,
although we must remain optimis-
tic.” One of themajor reasons 1
remain optimistic is because I have
seen institutions change — often and
dramatically. .. - - —

This process not only requires
that we shou-ld\a“-at least be critically
aware  ” but also acknowledge the

a sufficient explana- .

23.7 percent in 1984. Families that
were once middle class have split
roughly in two: Half fell below the

median and half rose above it..

Households with less than 75 per-
cent of the median income rose from
35.5 percent to 37.7 percent of the
population. Households with
incomes above 125 percent of it rose
from 36.3 percent to 38.6 percent.
The bipolar income distribution of

rich and poor is replacing the wide.

expanse of the middle class, which
had been associated with many
virtues of liberal democracies.

Prior to President Reagan’s 1982
tax cut there was a 9.5-to-one gap
between the richest 20 percent and
poorest 20 percent of Americans.
Afterwards, the pre-tax and transfer
gap was l2-to-one. Comparable fig-
ures for West Germany and Japan
are 8-to-one and 5.6-to-one respec-
tively. These countries start with a
more equal distribution of income
than we end up within America.

It is both fair and accurate to
maintain that far from mitigating
poverty, the American political
economy, especially under the Rea-
gan administration has contributed
to its growth. Meanwhile, poverty’s
counterpart, wealth, has become
increasingly concentrated.

Modern socialism is for the rich
and powerful. It reveals itself not
only in the distribution-of national
wealth, but in the “rescuing” of
failed enterprises that are too large,
too “important” or politically «too
powerful to fail.

A moral justification ‘for Ameri-
ca’s political economy is needed for
the impoverishe.d, the small-
business person and the farmer, all
for whom bankruptcy is tolerated, if

-not accepted. A moral justification

is needed for the class legislation

which has boosted the position of

the ' rich and powerful upon the
backs of thepoor.‘ A-moral justifica-
tion is needed, but is it to be found?

the "process of implementing change

through an active conscience, politi- -

cal savvy and the ethics of confron-
tation. There is nothing static or

intractable about any of the world's _

institutions.

Michael Ashford’s words have
given me the hope that genuine
peace is possible and that militarism
is a destructive option in a needful

world. But let‘s take it to_ its just,

conclusion. V _

What is it? The answer is asthma.

A research team headed by Dr.
Robert Rogers, chief of pulmonary
medicine at the University of Pitts-

ing a new medication that helps to
lessen the severity of asthma on a
long-term basis. This new drug is
called Tilade,

. According to Caruthers, “Tilade
works like Cromolyn to stabilize the
mast cells.” Fisons Corporation sees
a much better future for Tilade
because of its advantages over Cro-
molyn Sodium. Tilade has obtained
better results on all ages in the popu-
lation and the inhaler powder is
much less irritating than the spin-
haler of Cromolyn. ‘

I "Showc’ase’—"’September 27, 1985"

Playwrights

By Carrie Stetler
With bold spirit and humble heart,

I they tried to dramatize the plight of

the worker as he vainly searches for
peace and prosperity in industrial
America. Two local playwrights,
equipped only with noble intentions
and sparse sets, struggled to depict

the fruitless labor and broken dreams '

that are the factory workers’ lot. In
the end, these right—minded plays

could barely move ’neath the weight V,

of their authors’ social responsibility.
The Famous Rider featured a dou-
ble bill of social melodrama last week-

 end with ”The Unionization of Mike

LaForge” by Gerald Musinsky, and
”The Jungle” by Pittsburgher John
Louis Dezeran. The first of the two
was horrendously acted, hackneyed
and full of polemical dialogue. The
”Unionization’s” regular—Joe-hero
and his cronies at the automotive
plant become involved in so many
densely rhetorical discussions that
the audience feels as if it were watch-

ing a text book on left-wing politics

being recited by actors who will prob-
ably go home and watch the Steele/r’s
game when they're done with the
play. In other words, Bill Laux, the
man who played Mike LaForge, our
self-righteous protagonist, probably
did ,work at an automotive plant (or
still does) and decided to be in the play
as a favor for a friend.

One can just imagine Gerald
Musinsky in a ”Play—Wri’ting O03"
course,’ working with innocent con-
ceit on his blue-collar opus, trying to

' show what it's really like at an-auto-

motive plant; trying to show how
unfair everything is; trying to show
what clicks the. managers are.

So he called up some of his buddies,

 

had Bill play Mie,cast a guy

looks like Bruce Springsteen to play
the swaggering rebel in ”The Unioni-
zation,” and enthusiastically got to
work on meager but effectively stark
sets. Stuck for an ending to the play,
he decided to have Mike get fired for
putting his ”mark” on a car, sent him
out to the bars to bitch with the guys
from the plant, and finally, in a fit of
irrational rage brought about by his
powerlessness, beat his do-gooder
wife. ‘

sink under iwei

  

I wanted to sn_ick:r and roll my eyes
during this self—important perform-
ance but I was so close to the stage I
was afraid Bill or one of the other
guys in the play would see me, Any-
way, what kind of human being
would I be to chortle at the hard
work, sincerity and dogged energy
that went into this production?
The second play, ”The Jungle," an
adaption of Sinclair Lewis’ novel
about the exploitation and filth of a

aspirations 

early 1900s meat packing plant, was
more polished and smoothly acted
than ”Unionization,” but it involved
tedious descriptions of wretched con-

- ditions and degrading procedures at
«the plant. Also unsurprising were

the idealogical soliliquies of a worker
who wants to organize. "The Jungle”
was centered around a clear-eyed and
strapping Lithuanian family who
”vaant jobs een Amareeka” (the
worst thing about this play was the
actors’ bogus slavic accents). After
getting their jobs, they become the
victims of poverty and Snidely Whip-
lash management figures. The

pathos of it all was occasionally mov- '

ing but largely cliched and overdone.
The players were spirited but little

- more than above average.

Call me callously bourgeois, butit

takes more than tear-jerking, and _

wordy, dull, realism to make me sym-

pathetic to the problems of the Amer- \

ican worker. And it will take more

accomplishment and inventiveness‘

for these local playwrights to succeed
outside of their own back yards.

Social Amnesia and itsimplications

By David Zuchowsky

The third and last segment of the '

Off-Forbes Festival, presented by the
Pittsburgh filmakers, was a "high-

'tech’’ theatre piece staged by the

Impossible Theatre Group from Bal-
timore and performed at the Stephen
Foster Memorial Theatre. The refer-
ence to high-tech was _made because
the group uses such electronic gadg-
etry as a computerized slide presenta-
tion and music synthesizers along
with conventional theatrical devices

and formats.

tage of scenes beginning as far back in
history as Columbus’ arrivalin Cuba
and a mosaic of voice over and visual
slide-projected quotes of personages
as diverse as Helen Keller, John Dos
Passos, Black Elk, John F. Kennedy
and Bertold Brecht. V

, The electronic gadgetry succeeded

in amplifying the impact of the the- ?

matic core of the piece (the human
misery that results from an exploita-
tive socio-economic system) much
more effectively than just a regular
theatrical performance. Musical

underscoring in the film intensifies

the emotional and dramatic elements
of each scene and Bob BoiIen’s com-

positions for synthesizer performed’

throughout the play have a similar
effect. They set a mood for the play
and established an auditory environ-
ment suggestive of Huxley’s ”Brave

New World” or_ Orwell’s ”1984," a

threatening, menacing and paranoid
atmosphere. '

Eatery reviews

Pinocchio’s

If Gepetto (the creator of the

wooden “Pinocchio”) were in Oak- '

land today and made his way over to
Michael Sorci‘s restaurant, he may
be surprised to see over 20 of his
wooden friends scattered through-
out the restaurant and bar. These
wooden dolls will notcome alive;
they are just part of the decor in one

i of Oakland’s newest escapes from

fast-food dining, Pinocchio’s.

Located at 4415 Fifth Ave. (that’s
Webster Hall), Pinocchio’s attracts
both young and old. The apartments
in the building bring in many custo-
mers as do events in Oakland. The
building houses only 20 percent stu-
dents, but many have found their
way to Pinocchio’s.

The restaurant sports a playful
decor. The walls are painted with
fairy-tale-like animals, hot air bal-
loans and scenes of picnics and peo-
ple. Napkins are in assorted colors
and the chairs are plum and green.
The dress is casual for lunchand a
bit dressierin the evening. .

The menu at Pinocchio’s has a
variety of finger foods, soups and
salads, and it changes daily. Sand-
wiches are priced between $3.25 and
$5.25. Entrees featuring pasta,
chicken, meat and fish are available
starting at $5.95. One Pinocchio spe-
cial that sells extremely well is the
l0-ounce ribeye steak with sauteed
mushrooms for $7.95. This price

’ includes a big help-yourself salad

(available with any entree), a baked
potato and rolls.

Robert Johnson, 25, was at

Pinocchio’s for the first time and ‘

tried the ribeye special along with
the barbequed ribs for an appetizer.
“The ribs were bite-sized and really
tender. They brought out a plate of
steaks so I could choose the one I
wanted. Everything was good,
including the service. I'll be back.”

The bar serves a variety of ice
cream “fun drinks,” including rasp-
berry barettos (Chambord, ama-

‘ retto and ice cream), creamsicles

(vodka, triple sec, orange juice and
ice cream) and aggravations (scotch,
Kahlua and ice cream). These drinks
are priced at $2.95. They also serve a
variety of frozen drinks, including
four different kinds of slushes -

apricot, raspberry, strawberry and _

watermelon —— for $1.95.
Pinocchio’s happy hour is Mon-
day through Friday evenings from 5
to 7 with reduced prices on all beer
and drinks. Drafts‘ are 75 cents,
domestic bottles are $1 and imports
are $1.75. Most mixed drinks are $2
and the popcorn is free.
Pinocchio’s also has the only
video jukebox in Pittsburgh. It’s a
regular jukebox, but it has a video
screen on top of it. The TV screen

can also display the videos for the _
“jukebox and for 50 cents you can see

one of over 40 videos available.
There’s also a poker machine at
which to try your hand.

. Pinocchio’s has live entertain-
ment too. If jazz is your style, you’ll
like trombonist Harold Betters and
his group, one of September’s fea-
tured musicians.

The restaurant is open Monday
through-Thursday, ll a.m. to‘ 11
p.m.; Friday and Saturday, 11 a.m.
to l a.m.; and Sunday 11 a.m. to 9
p.m. Food and appetizers are served
in the bar until midnight on
weekends. '

Simply
French

Simply French, 3c.14.-46
Atwood St., is simply delicious,
and the establishment’s afforda-

ble prices will not hurt a colle-

giate _bud get. -

Having opened for business
Jan. 1, the restaurant has already
acquired a group of regulars. On
Saturday night, the line stretches
out the door. And it’s not the
decor — gold and velvet wall-
paper, stucco walls, vinyl table
cloths and gold lamps — that
keeps the people coming back. It

  

  

.,,.

is the consistently good food.

Everything on the menu is a la
carte, with the exception of hot
french rolls, which are served
with every meal. The menu offers
a variety of soups and other
appetizers, and the entrees range
from $3.95 to $1 I, with most fal-
ling between $5 and $7.

The soups are a great way to
begin your meal. Garnished with
croutons and parsley, the gaspa-
cho ($1.50) is excellent. This
soup contains finely minced
vegetables and is spicy but not
overwhelming.

The mussel orange soup
($1.50), served warm, is not to be
missed. This interesting combi-
nation features a generous por-
tion of mussels and pieces of
onion in a ﬂavorful creamy broth
laced with orange. It is unusual
fare and representative of the
creativeness of chef Michael

Hooker.

The other appetizers are also
wonderful. The warm vegetable
strudel ($2.25) is a house spe-
cialty and features cheese,
minced carrots and spinach
layered in pastry and served with
sour cream. '

Mussels dij on is another phen-
omenal appetizer. It can be had
as an appetizer ($2.75) or an
entree ($5.75), and in either case
will highlight the meal. The dijon
sauce is ﬂavorful, with a hint of

lemon. And be sure to eat the .

mussels with a large soup spoon
to capture more of the sauce.

_Fettucine ($3.95), another
entree, comes in a generous por-
tion and is topped with freshly
grated Parmesan cheese. It is
mild and creamy.

The orange mousse with choc-
olate sauce ($2.75) is a particu-
larly outstanding dessert. Served

in a wine glass, it consists of a
portion of smooth, creamy
orange confectionshot through
with pieces of orange, a thin layer
of rich chocolate and a scoop of
whipped cream garnished with
chocolate shavings.

Another good dessert choice,
the cold chocolate souffle
($2.75), is a thick square of choc-
olate cake, served with a tangy
raspberry sauce.

_ Simply French does not have a
liquor license; however, it does
permit patrons to provide their
own alcoholic beverages, charg-
ifng a 50-cent-per-person corkage

ee.

The restaurant is open Mon-

day through Saturday, 4:30-9:30
p.m., and reservations are taken
only for parties of six or more on
weekdays. All major credit cards
are accepted.

The following article is the first of a
series examining weight loss
programs.

By Niccol Donnelly
The Pitt News

As I return to another year of
classes, I realize that my clothes fit a
little tighter than last fall; that is, if
they fit at all. Of course, I didn’t
wake up one morning and say: “Oh,
no, what happened? I’m fat.” I knew
I was gaining weight each time I
bought new clothes for size rather
than style. And each time 1 did this, I

‘ tried to lose weight. I dieted, fasted

and exercised. S‘omehow, I always
managed to gain back every pound I
sweated off. The effort didn’t seem
worth it. 1
Unfortunately, I think that a lot of
college students can sympathize
with this situation. And with the fit-
ness craze and the media and medi-
cal drives to stay thin, developing an
effective weight-loss program is
becoming an obession with millions
of American men and women.
During my ‘search for the perfect
weight-loss program, I encountered
several facets of the weight control
industry — the fads and the facts,

the rights, the wrongs, the feasible
and the non—feasible options for col-
lege men and women. In this article,
diet centers will be examined.

A diet center is an organization
that weighs, counsels, measures and
monitors you on a specific diet plan.
I emphasize this type of weight con-
trol first because the diet center is
often used as a last resort. Yet, its
results (although the figures vary
from center to center) prove it to
have a high successrate. Perhaps it
would show an even higher rate of
success if it were utilized sooner.
Too many people wait until their
weight problem becomes extreme
before they consider a diet center.
This makes the price seem very high
because of the numerous weeks of
service required to take off a large
amount of weight.

The center I interviewed is
appropriately named “Diet Center.”
Most diet centers are similar to this
one, with variations in pre-prepared
foods, minor price differences and
diet supplements (usually pills or
powders). - ' .

The Diet Center bases its diet on a
diet developed by Sybil Ferguson in
Rexburg, Idaho, over seven years

_ago. She developed the diet plan

because she, too, was frustrated by

wher own_ attempts to lose weight.

There are now over 2,000 weight-
loss programs offering her diet. The
Diet Center’s version has five stages:

Conditioning —‘ This is a two-day
period when you get your body used

to natural sugar by adding fresh fruit
to your diet. You also begin taking
vitamin C, Cal-mag (a calcium and
magnesium pill to make up for the
lack of dairy products in the diet)
and the Diet Center’s natural sup-
plement, made up primarily of
vitamin B. ’

This supplement is essential to the
diet as it is taken every four hours
(two pills at a time) beginning at 7:30
a.m. It contains no drugs and is not a
sugar pill. Its purpose, however, is to
keep your blood sugar level up,
reduce sugar cravings, reduce
hunger and give you energy that you
get from the natural sugar in your
body.

During the conditioning phase
you eat a lot of fruit and are allowed
unlimited amounts of protein and
vegetables, but you must eat your
food in order: fruits, proteins and
breads. This phase ends after two
days

Reducing — During this phase
your food groups become limited in

/food choices. Your intake consists of
about 950 to 1,200 calories a day.
But the Diet Center stresses that the
diet is not based on calories.‘ Instead,
you count grams of protein, carboh-
ydrates, fat, water, vitamins, miner-
als, ﬁber and bulk.'This stage lasts
until you reach your desired weight;

Stabilization —— Once you have
lost the weight you set out to lose,
you enter this stage. You are allowed
to add some of the foods lost in the
reducing stage to your diet, now

Persgnal Diet center is effective but exp

x , ulV}~.~:-.',a -’»‘_~v',,

knowing how to compromise and
eat the better foods. This is to get the
body used to its new weight. You
remain in this stage one week for
every two weeks you spent in the
reducing stage.

Maintenance — After you stabil-
in your body, you are put on a
maintenance program which allows
you free .visits to the center for up to
52 weeks. This is to ensure that you
stay at your new weight. ’

Nut'ritt'on/ Behavior modification
classes — This final stage of the Diet
Center’s program is geared to ensure
a, permanence to your weight loss.
You are taught to make sound nutri-
tional choices and to plan you meals.

Other classes include food, prepara- 0

tion and eating habits. .

You are instructed through each
phase with books and daily counsel-
ing. This includes free vitamin and
food samples, a food card for shop-
ping, informational pamphlets and a
before-and-after picture.

This diet works through a combi-
nation of processes. Although it
claims not to be based on water, it
does function in a similar manner.
The diet requires eight glasses of
water a day, and you are allowed
only two other drinks. It stresses the
importance of the body’s natural

~chemicals reacting to a complex-

carbohydrate diet plan.

The center also stresses the role of
the dieter as being crucial, to its suc-
cess. It is important to stick to the

- plan without substitution, to plan a

ensive  A  

/

schedule enabling the dieter to eat
meals before 8 p.m., to visit the cen-

ter daily and to engage in light T

exercise.

There are numerous advantages
to this diet. It can be adapted to the
food available in the cafeteria with
minimal addition preparation, and
it encourages the dieter to change his

eating habits, providing a lifetime - ’

maintenance program that is both
nutritional and effective. _ e
V Despite the positive benefits of the
diet, one problem is that the diet
center’s plan does not offer a variety
of foods and since substitutions are
not permitted, the diet may seem
inﬂexible.
Another drawback, especially for

college students, is that alcohol is '

not permitted. According to the diet,

it is set back three days with every - 7

drink.

The largest concern many stu- 

dents have when working with the
diet center is the cost of participating
in the program. Vitamins and sup-
plements must be purchased from
the center, and can add up to an
average price of $150. The diet plans
revolve around three, six and 10
week programs, at a rate of $150,
$270 and.$395, respectively.

While the diet center is an expen-_ A‘ 
sive undertaking, the members boast -

of results of 10-12 pounds in three

weeks and up to 35 pounds in 10 A :50
weeks..It does cost a lot of money’ ,
and may take a great deal of time to

this may be the best non-traditional,

Pitt dermatologist offers late summer sunburn

By Lisa Podrat
The Pitt News

Sun-worshipping has become a
year-round preoccupation. People
will do anything from sunbathing on
their lunch hours to vacationing
where the sun is hottest, whether
that be a tropical isle or a ski slope.
Even in September, the sun craze
continues with the last-minute tans
— browning before the bad weather
sets in.

What some don't realize or tend to
ignore is that each time you expose
yourself to the sun unprotected, you
increase the rate of your skin's aging
process. And if you are a real sun

    
      
      
   
      
         
     
   

Health service offers variety

By Nadia Moritz -
Features Editor

The Student Health, Service.
You've noticed the $36 at the bottom
of your tuition bill and you've
passed the brown brick office on the
first floor of Brackenridge Hall. But
what exactly is it?

“Most students associate the Stu-
dent Health Services with a place to
go where you get sick,-" said Shirley
Haberman, Pitt's health educator.
“But we're also committed to help-
ing students stay well  preventing
sickness."

According to Haberman, the
most used facet of the Student
Health Service is the general medi-
cine — examinations by physicians
for colds, sore throats, viruses,
sprained ankles and any type of fam-
ily doctor domain. But the center
also offers minor outpatient surgery
as well as treatment in the area of
dermatology, immunization injec-
tions and gynecology.

worshipper, you greatly increase

your chances of getting skin cancer. a

The American Cancer Society
estimates that almost all of the
300,000 cases of skin cancer deve-
loped by Americans annually are
considered to be sun-related.

The first time a child is overex-
posed to the sun to the point of burn-
ing, and each time thereafter, the
skin gets weaker and loses its elastic-
ity. This type of continuous expo-
sure to the sun can cause dark
patches and scaly grey growths
called keratoses, a prelude to skin
cancer. ‘ ’

Dr. John Lenox, a staff dermatol-
ogist at the Student Health Service,

The gynecological services are
located in Forbes Clinic, and are
also included in the student health
fee. These services include every-
thing from routine examinations to
contraceptive care and pregnancy
determination to treatment of sexu-
ally transmitted diseases.

To treat psychological problems,

the university also employs psychol- ‘

ogists and a psychiatrist, as well as
an alcohol counselor.

Another function of the student
health services is health education.
“I'm disappointed with the program
at Pitt. A student‘ can have four
years of education and never have
exposure to a health class," said
Haberman. “We're trying to develop
more of _a self-help program in the
form of support groups to allow for
education.”

These support groups are initiated
either by student interest and sup-
port, or by a community group. Cur-
rently, the health service offers
programs in stress management,

alcohol awareness, eating disorders‘

and weight control.

“Weight loss has been a major stu-
dent focus, especially with the
women. Sometimes too much so,"

said: “There is much too much
cancer we see coming from sun-
burni Eventually the people who go
out and lie in the sun and get all of
this heavy tan are going to suffer
early aging of their skin, and without
a doubt, they'll get wrinkles, dry
skin, and their skin will be more sus-
ceptible to cancer of one kind or
another. What we are seeing now is
mainly the damage that was done
30-40 years ago.” , A

If you spend a lot of timegin the
sun, you should be aware of the early
warning signs of skin cancer. Most
skin cancers due to sun exposure are
curable and have visible early signs.
The American Cancer Society has

said Haberman. “It's really at the
center of a lot of student minds."
Weight loss programs at the

health center focus on both nutrition ‘

as well as exercise, and there are reg-
ular workshops offered in both.

According to Haberman, fresh-
men are more vulnerable to eating
disorders, stress and other disorders.

“Freshmen are the most suscepti-
ble because they are coming into a
new environment, cutting ties, mak-
ing new friends and this makes you
more susceptible to health prob-
lems," said Haberman.

This susceptibility applies espe-
cially to eating disorders.

“Freshmen’s eating concerns
adjust with their lives, and a lot of
times they end up using food for
different reasons  to overcome
idleness, provide comfort or to
relieve boredom. We encourage
them to develop other interests, and
to join a group that gets you
involved with other students.”

The topic of eatingfdisorders and

topics may addressed through out-
reach projects within the residence
halls or Greek residences. ‘

listed these three particular signs to
watch for: A sore that does not heal,
a change in the size or color of a wart
or mole, and the development of any
unusual pigmented area. '

Generally, these signs will not
prove to be cancerous,“ but only a
doctor can confirm this through an
examination. If found early, the
cancer can be removed with little
trouble or scarring; left untreated,
serious scarring and death can
result.

If you are going to sunbathe, you
should protect yourself from the sun
as best you can. When chosing a sun
screen, always look for one that has
a protection index number. The

Pitt Union. Under no circumstances may posters or signs of any natures be

Byars out for Ohio State game with broken

Heisman Trophy candidate Keith _

Byars of Ohio State‘ will be lost to
the Buckeyes for their season opener
against Pitt on Sept. 14. Byars, a 6-2,

236-lb. senior, suffered a broken.

bone in his right foot during football
practice on Labor Day. He was
expected to be the head of the Ohio
State offensive attack this season.
Pitt head coach Foge Fazio
expressed mixed emotions over the
news of Byars’ absence from the
Buckeye lineup. “I just like to cau-
tion ours squad,” said Fazio. “I
remember a couple of years ago we
went down to Maryland. Their start-
ing quarterback couldn't play, and
their second kid came in, and we
lost.” Fazio added, “It’s always nice
to say that you played against a
Heisman Trophy candidate and
gave it your best shot at him and
challenged him. I’m sure Keith feels
bad. We feel bad for him, but the

game goes on.”

Yes, it will, minus Byars, who Pitt 4

fans will recall vividly from the
Fiesta Bowl two years ago. Byars
had a dramatic 99-yard kickoff
return for a touchdown against Pitt
that proved to a big play in a game
that was decided in the waning
moments of the game. That was his
sophomore year. '

Last year, Byars joined the
nat_ion’s backfield elite as he led the
nation in rushing, scoring and all-

purpose running. Over three sea-.

sons, he has ‘gained 4,207 yards
either through rushing, receiving or
kick-returning. He was the 1984 Big
10 Most Valuable Player, beating
out, among others, Purdue quarter-

' back Jim Everett.

Against Illinois last year, Byars
had 274 yards rushing and scored
five touchdowns — some frighten-
ing statistics.

  SP0 

Who will replace Byars? Most
likely junior John Woolridge, a 5-
1 l, 190-lb.junior from Akron, Ohio.

Woolridge played against Pitt’s . I

answer to Byars, tailback Charles
Gladman, in high school. *
Woolridge is said to be-"a great
athlete. He runs a 40-yard dash in
4.42 seconds and lifts 600 lbs. He has
a 32-inch vertical leap and was the
Buckeyes’ second-leading ground

gainer last year with 663 yards. Not-

bad for a backup.

Whoever plays,‘ it will be a chal-
lenge. Following Purdue’s blistering
of the Pitt secondary last weekend,
Fazio does not want other teams to
try to exploit the Pitt defense the
way Jim Everett did.

“It might be better if he were in
there,” said Fazio with a chuckle. “I
was telling someone this morning,
they might try and _pass the ball
now.” '

Panthers get off to good start p 

put 1984 season behind them

Anyone who got to watch Satur-
day night’s Pitt-Purdue contest, at
one time‘ or another, saw visions of
1984 all over again. Whether it was
_in the third quarter, when Purdue
turned an 11-point deﬁcit into a

' three-point lead, or in the fourth

‘quarter, when two interference calls
on Keith Tinsley kept the Boiler-
maker’s hopes alive, it seemed like
we had seen this somewhere before.

"‘I felt the same way I did two
years ago against Ohio State and

"Penn State,” said Panther quarter- ‘

back John Congemi, who passed for
110 yards on 10 completions, includ-
ing two’ touchdowns. “We didn’t
play all that badly to lose," added
Congemi. “I just didn’t want to go
through that again.”

For a while, it seemed like it
would be Purdue who would be frus-
trated. The Panthers came out like
gangbusters, as the offensive line
gave Purdue a lesson in pass and run
blocking. The Panthers pounded
out 121 yards rushing in the first

dominating the line of scrimmage,
the defense was. Led by Bill Sapio
and Tony Woods, the defense,
although allowing 398 yards
through the air,‘permitted only 66
yards on 34 carries onithe ground.

Purdue quarterback Jim Everett

I did his part in adding gray hairs to

Pitt coach Foge Fazio’s head. Eve-
rett completed 34 of 53 passes, three
for touchdowns, and ran’ for
another. *

“I can’t say enough about the Eve-

r‘ett guy,” said Fazio of the senior .

All-America candidate. “We were
trying to take away the deep curl,
and they ran their backs underneath
our linebackers.”

Everett did just that. He hit run-
ning backs Ray Wallace and Rod
Carter for a combined 15 passes,
almost half of his total completions.
It was not enough though. Everett
capped a fine game with one of his
few miscues of the evening.

Following Purdue’s final‘ touch-
down, a 31-yard strike from Everett

. ZOIIC. ‘

Congemi, who watched the play
at Fazio’s side on the Pitt sidelines,
remembered it well.

“We kept on getting bad breaks 3

the whole night,” recalled Congemi.
“In the end, though, we got the best
break of the night.”

Breaks seem to be going in Pittb
direction this year. One that went
especially in the Panthers’ direction
is the one in Keith Byars’right foot.

Byars, the senior all-everything
running back from Ohio State who
was a leading candidate for the Heis-
man Trophy, suffered a broken foot

. in practice on Monday, and will be

sidelined when the Panthers travel
to Ohio State on September‘ 14.

Ohio State suffered a severe blow when tailback Keith Byars «
suffered a broken bone in his foot during a Labor Day practice‘ '

Washington aims to
remain in Pitt lineup  

By Bob Travers
_Staff Writer *

His first semester in college is not ‘

one that Troy Washington is likely
to look back on with a great feeling
of accomplishment. Instead of play-
ing in the Panther defensive back-
field, the 6-2, l90-lb. Washington
was sitting out the year with a medi-
cal redshirt.

Washington got his first taste of
major college ball on Saturday in

» Pitt’s 31-30 win over Purdue. While

he did not make any spectacular

‘plays in the Pitt secondary or..com-

plete any interceptions, it was a good
start for the Duquesne native.
“This game was really an eye-
opener for me," he said after the
game. “I got to see how much faster
things move in Division I than they
did in high school, butit surprised
me a little just how much faster."
Still, it is easy to believe that
Washington prefers the fast track on

' the Pitt Stadium turf to the table in

the slower-paced training room. “It
was pretty tough last year with the
redshirt," he said. “I had to just sit
and watch instead of being out there
with them." ‘

A redshirt. however, does have its

‘advantages. It gives a player a whole

year to learn the scheme of things
without putting his job on the line
every Saturday. This is the case with
Washington.

‘‘I think being around here last
year will help. but what really helped
me was some of the older players
teaching me things. showing me
what to do. Bill Callahan was a real
big help to riie."

Now Washington is ready to
become a permanent fixture in the
Pitt secondary. “I hope I play all

year. ljust went out and played my

best tonight."

Washington. due to last year's
redshirt. has four years of eligibility
left and was listed as the only Pitt

.- ifr_e_shmanjto start against “Purdue.

under my belt was good for me. You

OI).

That next game will be Sept. 14 at

Ohio State — ateam known as

much for its running as Purdue is for -

its passing attack. That game could
provide a bit of a breather for the
Pitt secondary that was bombarded
‘with 53 Jim Everett passes. .

“All during camp the coaches kept

stressing to us again and againithat

Purdue would pass. The one thing

that surprised me about their pass-.
ing game was the fact that they
didn't go long as much as I thought
they would." ’_
Washington admitted he thought

the Boilers would pick on his sidegof

the field more. "I thought with me

would come at me.“ he said. Instead.

Big game
Pitt defense
  prepared to turn
  things around

>3

‘' a straight ‘base .passjr‘ushing..”

 

By Michael Bertonaschi
Staff Writer

To hear head coach Don Nehlen
of West Virginia talk about his
offense, it would seem that all the
Pitt Panthers need to do is show up
at Mountaineer Field on Saturday
to collect win No. 2 of the young.
season. -

Consider the strategy that Nehlen
is using in practice this week, follow-
ing last week’s 28-0 thrashing at the
hands of Maryland. “I think that
this week we’_re going to practice get-
tin’ in the huddle and gettin’ up to
the line, and see if we don’t screw
that up,” he said. “Right now we
can’t run a play. Hopefully by Satur-
day we’ll be able to run two. But

offensively we’ve been very bad, very
bad. Maryland ‘bout killed us.”

However,. before all of you stu-
dents who bought WVU tickets
through this week’s lottery consider
bagging the trip and watching the
game on television, remember that
this season, the Pitt defense has been
just whatthe doctor ordered for sick
opposing offenses. ‘

Not counting ,\Jim Everett of
Purdue, who may be the best passer
that Pitt fans have seen since Dan
Marino, the defense has surrendered
tons of passing yardage to Ohio
State and Boston College, ‘whose’
quarterbacks had little experience
and about as much mobility as the
Cathedral of Learning. They will
face another green signal caller on
Saturday in sophomore John Talley
of West Virginia. Unlike the pre-
vious two quarterbacks, though,
Talley is a great athlete who can run
with the ball. -

The Panther secondary has come
under fire since giving Boston Col-
lege 400 yards passing. But senior
defensive end Bill Sapio disagrees
with the criticism. “I don’t think it's
their fault,” he said. “I know against
B.C. sometimes I wasn’t getting
more than two or three yards pene-
tration and that’s putting a lot of
pressure on them. I know one time I
was fighting to get’ in there. It must
have been eight to 10 seconds and
the quarterback was still standing in
the pocket and you can’t expect
those guys to cover them for eight to
10 seconds.”

West Virginia has a strong offen-
sive line lead by 6-7, 290 lb.tackle
Brian Jozwiak. The Panthers must
provide__a better pass rush in order to
avoid the secondary from being
picked apart. “I think we’ve got to be
a ‘little more creative on the pass
rush," said Sapio. “I know from
watching the B.C. film at least half
the times I rushed I ran straight into
the guy. ‘I've got to use my quickness
a‘ little" more ‘and be a "little" more"
‘creative and ‘take a chance every:

‘Although Sapio ’ was quick?‘

some of the -blame must go to ‘the

"defensive backs, especially in. the

enabled the Eagles to complete
passes at will.

Senior cornerback John “Ducky”
“Lewis blamed the secondary’s timid-
ness on a lack of concentration. “We
weren’t concentrating on our assign-
ments in the first half,” he said.
—“You’re supposed to be at a certain
distance from the receiver and we
were just coming out there, not even
worried about where we were lining
up, taking wild guesses and that’s
not us. Coach Fazio couldn’t believe
it and'we couldn’t believe it. That
was the strangest game I ever played
in my life and that includes all of last
year." A .

Sapio agreed that the poor perfor-
mance in the first half was due to
mental breakdowns. Both he and
Lewis pointed out that the team did
not practice well during the week
prior to the B.C. game. “It starts in
practice,” he said. “We just can’t
wait for the game. Last week our
practices were kind of slow in‘ the
beginning but at the end of practice
we were doing good and I think that 3
reflected the way we played on
Saturday.”

, '|
If you are a betting person and
you care to gauge the West Virginia
game according to how practice
went during the week, head coach
Foge Fazio was pleased with the
players mental and physical prepa-
ration. “We had ,a l,ot of teaching
going _on in‘the beginning of the
week and I thought the players were
very attentive,” he said. “Then later
on we got into the physical part and
the defense got fired up. We prac-
ticed a‘ couple goal-line stands and it
was lively and aggressive and we had
a few guys going after each other
which is a sign that we are ready to

- explode.”

The Panther defense must decide
how to attack quarterback John
Talley. He stands 6-6 tall, weighs 220
lbs., and has great mobility along
with a rifle arm.. “You have to be
careful, because if he gets outside the
blitz,'he can hurt you,” said Fazio.

“He’s a goodathlete,” Lewis said.
“He rolls out well, he runs well and if
he gets his confidence up, they say —
he’s like an All-American.” -

\“The object is to get to him the
best we can and try to get in his face

‘ and confuse him maybe mentally

and physically,” said Sapio. “What-
ever we can do to try to cause him to
think a little extra and delay his reac-
tion will help out the secondary.”
Pitt desperately needs a win to
avoid a slide into the direction of last
season’s disastrous 3-7-1 record. The
South Carolina Gamecocks come

Crucial games for Steelers-Panthers

Being a diehard Steeler and
I was particularly
excited about this season, as both
teams were expected. to have good
squads. After all, the Steelers earned
a berth-in the AFC Championship
game last season’ and everyone
knows Pitt’s 3-7-1 record last year
was a fluke. Pitt looked good Aug.
31 in a 31-30 win over Purdue and
the Steelers opened by romping _over
hapless Indianapolis, 45-3.

It hasn't been clear, sailing,
though. Pitt has dropped two
straight, making me relive last sea-
son’s nightmare. The Steelers
looked terrible on national televi-
sion a couple of weeks back in a 17-7
loss at Cleveland, before shutting
out Houston 20-0 last Sundav.

The Steelers are 2-1, but let’s
remember whom -they beat. Their
first three opponents’ records last
year were 12-36. At times, the Steel-
ers looked like the Super Bowl

Steelers’ season. The defense is solid,
giving up only 20 points in the first
three games, It is now time for Ma-
lone to take charge. This is his sixth _
year in the league and at 26, he is at
the age when quarterbacks enter
their prime.

A Steeler win would keep the
team in first place with a-3-l record,
but a loss would put them even head-
ing into consecutive away games at
powerful Miami and always-tough
Dallas. .

Pitt likewise is .in a position to
prove they are a good football team.
Whether Foge Fazio wants to admit
it or not, this game is the season for
the Panthers. -

A Pitt win could set the tempo fo
a 9-2 season  and 9-2 certainly is
within grasp. Pitt showed highly-

Davis, freshman playing his first col-

ness he showed so often at
Washington High in spinning for a
26-yard touchdown run.

Both Davis and Gladman are
banged up a little and are questiona-

' ble for this weekend. Expect both,

however, to be suited up when game
time arrives. ‘

“We’ll consider using both Davis
and Gladman in the same back-
field,” said Coach Fazio. “But we
need them both to be healthy and
they aren’t right now.”

Gladman, a sophomore whohas
bruised ribs, has rushed for 387
yards in three games while Davis
ripped for 100 on only 15 carries last
week.

L.C. Hubbard, a former def-
ensive back at Texas Christian
University, admitted on Wednes-
day to receiving cash payments
from Pitt defensive coordinator
Bob ‘Junkowhile Junko was an
assistant coach at the Southwest
conference school.

According to an article that
appeared in the Wednesday edi-
tion of The Dallas Morning
News, Hubbard revealed that
Junko and two other assistants,

Jamie Hunter and Mark Hatley,
collected money from football
boosters and handed it out
among players. ,

“When I was there, just about
all the top players were getting
paid,” said Hubbard.

The NCAA began an investi-
gation into the matter on Wed-
nesday. Cash payments of the
type mentioned here are a direct
violation of NCAA rules.

TCU coach Jim Wacker sus-
pended six players last week after
he learned that they received

TCU player says yes

cash payments during the reign
of previous head coach, F.A.
Dry. A few days later, TCU
booster Morris “Snake" Bailey
implicated Junko and Dry in an
article in the Fort Worth Star-
Telegram. Bailey claimed, “F .A.
Dry and Junko started the whol

thing.” i

Junko was defensive coordi-’
nator at TCU for six years before
being ﬁred, along with Dry and
the rest _of the coaching staff, fol-
lowing the 1982 season.

Dear Michael Spinks.

My initial reaction to ring

‘the decision in Saturday’s historic‘

anything else. I was praying that we

was proclaimed the winner, I was
ecstatic that Holmes could not equal
Rocky Marciano’s record. He did
not deserve it.

But let me set the record straight.
Holmes, while he was nowhere near

great ﬁghter. He could have never
beaten Marciano, but he would have
beaten just about any other
heavyweight.

Never. a spectacular fighter,
Holmes was a technician who rarely
made mistak_es in the ring. Holmes
should have never put himself in a
position where he would be com.-

I’ve -always loved watching. old ;

among the all-time heavies. Since
evefyone who loves boxing and its
history has one’, here's my version of
thetop 20 heavyweights of all time:

More than any other sports fan,‘

the boxing fan loves to argue over
fighters and anything else that has to
do with the ongoing saga of the ring.
Here are my thoughts on some of
today's “lords of the ring.”

Lately, the heavyweight division
has come under much criticism for
its lack of talent, but I think that
these days are soon to be behind us.

Spinks is rumored to be considering’

taking two or three more fights and
then retiring. If this proves to be
true, I would love to see a finale vs.
Pinklon Thomas (WBC champion).
Tony Tubbs (WBA) does not
deserve to be heavyweight champion
of the world, not by anytmeans- Let's.

see‘ him defend against Carl “The”

Truth" Williams. The result: ,a
knockout by Williams in seven.
Thomas vs. Williams is only a mat-
ter of time, ,these..two being 

cream of the cropiin a resurgence  —

the heavies. A revamped Tim With-"
erspoon, along with Tony Tucker
Mitchell Green, should be stars of
the immediate future. The Olympics
have bestowed upon us four promis-

ing prospects in the form of Tyrell
Biggs, Henry Tillman, Willie
DeWitt and my pick to be the best of
all of them, Francesco Damiani,
whose style is much more suited to
the pro'fessional’s ranks than the
amateur’s. A

Ever since the I90-pound Cruiser-

-weight division came into existence,
it has had trouble gaining recogni— ‘
tion. If it is promoted properly, a _

match between IBF champ Lee Roy
Murphy and WBA champ Dwight
Muhammad Qawi could bring the
division its first signs of notoriety. I,
wonder if Qawi has considered a
rematch with Spinks. ‘

I would love to see aﬁght between
Prince Mamah Mohammed and
Marvin Johnson for the soon-to-be-
vacated light heavyweight title.
Olympian Evander Holyfield looks
to dominate the division in a few
years, but'Mohammed and Johnson
are the top two contenders todav.

The upcoming bout for the undis-
puted middleweight title between
John “The Beast” Mugabi and- Mar-
velous Marvin Hagler will be a clas-
sic. Remember where you heard
this: I predicted that Mugabi will
shock the world by knocking out
Hagler inside of six rounds. I am
alsolooking forward to the ‘Thomas

Hearns-James Shuler confrontation

that will take place on the
undercard. -

I

I cannot believe that the I_BF has A
the -nerve'to' have Carlos Santos as 1-

their junior middleweight champ. I_n

four rounds with WBAchamp'Mike

, McCallur‘n.

One thing that I have noticed is
that in the higher divisions, power is
more dominant, while speed domi-
nates the lower divisions. Everyone
has noticed that, but did you ever

. . .‘l.i.gh-t‘?’..°i.:ght~i5 ih
all honesty, I can't see-'h‘iin,lasfing‘1"f» ' 5  r '  ‘'

notice that power and speed seem to

g merge in themiddleweight and jun-

ior middleweight divisions? Perhaps
thisgis why I have never seen a boring
ﬁght’ involving either of these
divisions. '

I really don’t expect much from
the proposed ﬁght to unify the wel-
terweight title between Donald
Curry and Milton McCrory.

McCrory is in over his head against -

Curry, although both have

announced plans to go on to the

higher divisions after this bout.’ If
given another title shot, I think that
Colin Jones will control the welter-

weights from that time until Mark
Breland is ready to ascend the

throne. If Breland is rushed, how- .
ever, the experienced Jones will send . '

him reeling.

‘The junior welterweights? Aaron
Pryor. Enough said.

The lightweight division is simply

LOADED. What more can be said

of a'division that contains the likes ‘
-of Jimmy Paul, Livingstone Bram-

ble, Jose Luis Ramirez, Edwin
Rosario, Harry Arroyo, and Olym-
pians Pernell Whitaker and Mel-
drick Taylor. Of course there is
Hector Camacho, who in my opin-
ion will be upset if he ever gets in the
ring with Tyrone ‘Crawley. Also,
don't count out the wily’ and still
dangerous veteran Cornelious Boza-
Edwards. A

 ‘~Perhaips‘ :the' ‘future  dominant

.\ -. > _

e current’ junior .

_/lightweight champ Julio Caesar

Chavez who has absolutely no com-
petition in his own weight class.

If you love action-packed ﬁghts,
then tune in tomorrow afternoon for
the featherweight championship
bout between WBA champ Barry
Mc_G_uigan_ and Bernard “The B.T.
Express” Taylor, which will be one
of the best of the year. Both McGui-
gan and Chavezare gifted action
ﬁghters. If McG.uigan,gets past Tay-
lor, a match against Chavez would
be the most exciting ﬁght of the
decade.

The status of tailback Charles,
Gladman for this Saturday’s Pitt-

questionable yesterday following

low sophomore A.B. Brown will get
his first collegiate start. Freshman

for 100 yards last week against Bos-

and was forced out of the game mid-

Lady
Panthers
90 for
tenth
straight  

By Kelley Butt
Staff Writer

Opening up a home stand this
weekend with Villanova, Seton Hall
and West Virginia, things are look-
ing good for the Lady Panthers. On
a winning streak of seven games, Pitt
will try to extend the string to 10 by
Sunday morning.

This will also be the first weekend.

that a lot of injured players will be
returning to the roster. Coach Col-
lier said, “We should be nearly back
to full strength. Hopefully, we will
have a complete roster to work with.
We plan to keep winning and stretch
our streak to 10. This is a very
important tournament for us, not
just in terms of wins. It is the last one
we play before we face Penn State
next weekend and it could set the
tone for the rest of the season.”_
Villanova, ranked behind'Pitt in
the Big East, will play the Lady
Panthers tonight at 7 in the field
house. Last Sunday, the Wildcats,
although they were defeated, gave
Pitt a very challenging game. Both
.teams played very well and the same
type of play can be expected this
weekend. Another added incentive

for Pitt is the fact that a former ,

teammate will be coaching against
Pitt. Pitt’s All-America Ulana
Kohutiak is Villanova’s assistant
coach. She will provide "both teams
with a challenge. Coach Collier
stated, ‘‘I’m very proud of Ulana.
She’s coaching a very good team and

point, they’re not a challengefor the

ings, Seton has improved enough to

“Kris Wexell will play some in her

By Thomas Danyluk
For The Pitt News

The Miami Dolphins will be tak-
ing their rediscovered defense into
Mile High Stadium this Sunday for
an AFC battle with the Denver
Broncos.‘ The Dolphins are coming
off an impressive shutout win over
the high-powered Kansas City
Chiefs, and will be looking for sim-
ilar success against John Elway and
the Broncos. Denver, meanwhile,
had a big offensive showing last

, Sunday, bombing Atlanta 44-28.‘

Elway, despite having an unimpres-
sive completion percentage (19-38,
50 percent), threw for 291 yards and
three touchdowns, including a 63-
yard scoring toss to Vance Johnson.
Sunday's game will be the first
regular-season meeting between
these two teams since 1975, when
Miami earned a hard fought l4-l3
victory. Both teams own 2-] records
and are looking to stay atop their
respective divisions.

The most interesting feature of
this game lies in the duel between the
Dolphins’ revamped defensive unit
and the volatile offense of Denver.
Miami’s defense had struggled con-
siderably _until the Kansas City
game, with injuries taking a great
deal of the blame. The Dolphins at
one time this season had only four
defensive starters from last year's
Super Bowl team in the lineup. The
return of holdouts, Glenn Black-

wood and Bob :Brudzinski' to the ,
‘squad will definitelyibolster the

 

I

 

Despite persistent ' problems,
Miami defensive coordinatorChuck
Studley is carrying a confident but
cautious attitude into the game. In a
telephone interview Tuesday, Stuck-
leysaid that his unit is finally mold-

.ing and beginning to play to its

potential, but will need another out-
standing effort in order tostop the
“very dangerous” John Elway. He
noted that the Denver offense is bas-
ically a big-play offense, fueled by a
long pass and the breakaway run.

When asked to compare Kansas

City quarterback "Bill Kenney to
Elway, Studley remarked, “Kenney
is not a running quarterback. He is
more of a drop-back passer, where
Elway moves frequently byidesign
and is ‘extremely mobile. It is that
aspect which make him much more
dangerous." He spoke of his days as
a 49er assistant coach under Bill
W._alsh, when the two would watch
and almost reverently admire
Elway’s perfect passing form. Stud-
ley sharply accounted for the
Bronco quarterbacks subpar com-
pletion rate in the Atlanta game by
stressing, “The Falcons put tre-
mendous pressure on Elway all day.
Yet,‘ he was still able to throw for
three touchdowns, including a 60-
yarder right at the start of the game.”

The Denver offense, too, has had
its share of problems. Lingering
injuries to Bronco back Gerald Will-
hite and Sammy Winder have ham-
pered therunning attack, which last
year was rated tenth in the league.
Elwayphimself has been plagued with
moments of inconsistency,‘ sparkling

one series and’ unimpressive ins,
. another. Although he's a winner, he

still needs schooling and, more

Dolphins  to buck Broncos ,  

Denver scheme. The-offensive line is

a Panzer division, and wide receivers

Vance Johnson, Steve Watson, and

‘Clint Sampson have proven to be

speedy, reliable targets. Speedy is
not really the correct adjective to
describe Johnson, who runs a 4.38 in
the 40.

Despite. their respective short-
comings, the battle between these
two AFC powerhouses should be
quite a show.

 

Miller

continued from page 19
the defensive backs would back up a
few steps, which would improve the
Panthers’ already strong running
game.

Pitt has played 10 of i2 quarters
this season above average, and
against some pretty fair competi-
tion. They are 1-2 though. It is time

to get back the respect they earned 8

throughout the 1970s. With some
improvement in the passing game,

and a little better pass defense, Pitt

can win their remaining games.

They must start Saturday. A loss
to West Virginia could demolish the
players to where another 3-7-1
record could occur.

Good teams find ways to win
when the chips are down. Both the
Steelers and Panthers are good
teams, with the talent to become
outstanding teams. .

Bet on the area teams to win some

‘conﬁdence back, starting“ this:-.:."
