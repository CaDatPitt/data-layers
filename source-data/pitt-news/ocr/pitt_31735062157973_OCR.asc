Engineering Dean Announces
Board of Trustee Committee

Development Part
Of Extended
Program

By JOAN THOMAS
The formation of a board of
trustee committee for en-
gineering and an engineering
and mines advisory council
for the development of the

schools of E & M was an-
nounced recently by Chancel-

lor R. H. Fitzgerald and Dean -

G. R. Fitterer, dean of the schools.

Although all the departments of
the two schools are fully. accredited
by the engineering council for pro-
fessional development, the trustee
committee and the engineering ad-
visory council have been organized
for continuous development of the
schools. They will also assist all
divisions to keep pace with the
rapid. change taking place in the
engineering sciences.

The trustee committee, ap-
pointed recently by Dr. Alan M.
Scaife, president of the Pitt
board of trustees, consists of Mr.
William, P. Snyder, Jr., chair-
man, and three other members.
Mr. Snyder is chairman of the
board of Crucible Steel Co. and
president of Shenango Furnace
Co.

The other members are Mr. Mar-
cus A. Follansbee, president of
Follansbee Steel Corporation, Dr.
A. W. Robertson, chairman of
ﬁnance committee, Westinghouse
Electric Corporation, and Dr. Ed-
ward R. Weidlein, president of
Mellon Institute.~

The University Schools of En-
gineering and Mines was founded
108 years ago, and is the oldest

— west of the Allegheny Mountains.
'A The schools consist of eight de-

' logical,

partments and offer accredited de-
grees in the 10 ﬁelds of aeronauti-
cal, chemical, civil, electrical, geo-
industrial, mechanical,

cording to Robert Newman, di-
rector of Men’s' Debate Associa-
tion, Coach “Red” Dawson who

unable to do so due to the strain
of the last two losses suffered by
the football team. In this event,
Frank Carver, graduatemanager
of athletics, will appear.

This 'week’s show will deal with
the manner in which Pitt’s sched-

The Engineering Council in-
cludes a committee consisting of
two alumni and one non—alum-
nus, together with the head of
each department. The commit-
tees will assist ‘department heads
in determining the future of
each ﬁeld in engineering and as-
sist in developing the depart-
ments toward an even greater
degree of excellence, according
to Dean Fitterer,

Dean Fitterer, in outlining the
present status of the schools, point-
ed out that “engineering now con-
stitutes one-fourth of all the
classes of students at the Univer-
sity, and that, although nearly 150
students were turned away this
year, enrollment is continuing to
increase.

Newman, assistant professor of
speech, “Campus” will be produced
for thirteen consecutive weeks on
Thursday evenings. The show will
present a different topic, pertain-
ing to college life, each week.

Other shows on the thirteen

Meeting; Asks Support

By DAVE
A vote of conﬁdence, the

and Staff

MAZER
ﬁrst of his Pitt career, was

given Head Coach Lowell “Red” Dawson and the rest of his

staff Monday night in a special Athletic Committee meet-

ing in the Chancellor’s ofﬁce.
After Saturday’s 46-7 deb
letic Director Tom Hamilton

acle against Minnesota, Ath-

felt that a get—together was

necessary to show that the com-9
mittee was still behind the varsity
football coach. .

It was hoped that this might
boost the morale of the team after
their two straight opening losses.
The committee members stressed
that there should be an all-out
effort for this Friday’s pep rally
to show the team that the stu-
dents and faculty are still back-
ing» the gridders.

Coach Not Present

Dawson was not in attendance
at the meeting but he was liotiﬁed
of its content yesterday. It was
the first time in his three-year
stay here that there was a special
athletic committee meeting for a
vote of conﬁdence.

In addition, Captain Hamilton

vene again todayto see if any of
the members had further sugges-
tions for aiding the situation.

The Athletic Director empha-
sized however, that today’s confab
was a closed meeting and that in
the event anything comes of it, an
announcement will be forthcoming.

In his Iirst season, the former
Tulane star directed the team to
a 6-3-1 record but last year came
in with 3-5-1 in the season that

platoon. -

This fall the Panthers were ex-
pected to face probably the tough-
est schedule in Pitt history but
were not counted on to fall apart
as they did in the Minnesota game.

Note Left on Blackboard

Dawson was deﬁnitely disgusted
with the second half of the Gopher
tilt as he left immediately after the
game without any comment except
a note on the dressing room black-
board which was addressed to the
newspapers. It read: “Pitt played
for 30 minutes.”

The committee stated that thi;

‘for the upcoming Notre Dame
clash but to encourage spiritthe
rest of the season. They hope that
students will take note of this and
turn out wholeheartly for this
Friday night’s rally which will be
broadcast nationally.

As a further measure, it is hop-
ed that the team will be permitted
to attend this rally. Usually, the
gridders retire to the Penn-Lin-
coln Hotel in Wilkinsburg the
night before a home contest so
as to rest up.

Finds Schooling More Intensive, F actual.

Initial Student to Have Scholarship

Coed Slit-clied Six
Weeks at Oslo U.

By NANCY JONES

Norway, although a poor coun-
try, is rich with friendly people
and a warm peasant atmosphere
similar to that of the Norwegian
Room here at Pitt. That is what
senior Jane Pickering found dur-

ing her six weeks of study at the V

University of Oslo this summer.

‘ During the week she studied
Norwegian music, politics, and
economics, but on weekends she
journeyed down into the valleys
near Stockholm ‘or ‘up onto the
mountain slopes near "Oslo.

In the mountains, the cottages
actually have grass on the’ roofs.
Janevisited a cottage that had
peasant designs on the cupboards,
pine panelling, and white birch
logs standing upright in the ﬁre-

place just like “our Norwegian
Room.” The Nationality commit-
tee of that room made it ppssible
for Jane’s trip.

Formerly the annual scholar-
ship had been given to members
of »Pitt’s faculty such as Dean of
Women Helen‘ P. Rush, Dean of
Men Theodore Biddle, and last
summer Emily Irvine, English in-

‘structor.

Communist Leads Class
After each meal everyone, even
the little boys, bowed and shook
the mother’s hand to thank her
for the food.
Of course, Jane said, Oslo
and its University were very
“Americanized.” H er classes
consisted of lectures by top-
notch people on such subjects
as foreign policy and political
‘parties. There were speakers
to represent each of the six
Norwegian parties, including a
Communist. 1 k
Here at Pitt, she is majoring in
Far Eastern studies. "She thinks
Norway’s,— schooling is “more in-
more factual.”
, Country Clean
“Students there go to school six
days a week.” Jane attended
school with the 175 U.S. students

SONG OF NORWAY-Although
J a n e Pickering, Norwegian
Room Committee scholarship
awardee, might not be singing
excerpts from the popular op-
eretta, she is singing praises of A
the people, with whom she lived
and studied while in Norway.

she sailed with. When the ship

stopped at Bergen, they were

, greeted by a large group of Nor-

wegianr students who showed
them " around and “completely
went out of their way to be nice.”
“They give ﬂowers for every
occasion,” she recalled. Other ob-
servations she made were of the
cleanliness of the country, and
the large amount of rainfall.
Because of the rain Jane didn’t
get to the Arctic Circle to see the
famous midnight sun. Never-the-
less she considered 20 hours of

; daylight during June and July a

novelty.
Vacations Compuls_ory
Another oddity was the com-

pulsory paid vacations which en-
titles every worker to ‘a three-
week holiday.

Language was not a difficult.
problem for her since most of
the people spoke _some English.
However, once when Jane went

. into a store and asked for blue
ink she came out with a neatly
wrapped bag containing two
raw eggs.

After summer school ended,
Jane visited relatives in England
for two weeks. She “loved Eng-
land” from “Big Ben” down to its
picturesque moors and hedge-
rows. »-

Viewed Louvre

In Paris she viewed Saint-
Chapelle and the Louvre where
“the pictures go on forever.”
There she, by chance, wandered
into a small room and saw the
crown jewels of France. But
when a gendarme charged up to
her furiously ﬁring French ques-
tions at her about what she was
doing there,_ she suddenly “wasn’t
speaking French that day.”

After seeing Geneva and Zurich,
Switzerland, she took a boat ride
up the Rhine River to Cologne.
Another stop she, remembered
was Heidelberg with “all _the uni-
versity ﬂavor.” “Student Prince”
cam-e to life for her at the Rex“ Ox,
Inn, birthplace of that musical.

Met .Pa.nther’s Orphan

At Antwerp, Belgium, a NATO
official gave her a conducted tour
of his newspaper plant. And in
Holland she met 15-year-old Betsy
Norbart, who is the war orphan
adopted and supported by Pitt’s
Panh-ellenic Council. ‘

_Jane arrived at Copenhagen,
Denmark, for the ﬁnal festival
day at “Tivoli,” a park, full of
'fun,and amusement.

“Everywhere the people were
so grateful and so anxious to re-
turn’ kindness,” Jane said. “Now
I have an entirely different feel-
ing when I see foreigners in our
country._

Group Gets
Pitt Honor

Dr. -Campbell Moses, ‘director of
Pi_tt’s Addison H. Gibson labora-
tory, presented plaques to three
Pittsburgh organizations for their

“notable assistance in the Crusade
to Conquer Cancer.”
The three organizations honored

at the Hotel William Penn, Oct. 1,

were television station WDTV,
Mellon Institute of Industrial Re-
search, and the Bulletin of the
Allegheny County Medical So-
ciety.

, Mellon Institute was cited by
Dr. Moses, past-president of the
Allegheny County Unit of the
American Cancer Society, for its
“generous donation of facilities
and continuous cooperation with
the society’s professional educa-
tion program of color television
conferences for physicians.”

Stephen Foster Memorial is sit-
uated on the campus. The Memo-
rial’s auditorium and social room
-are used for Pitt and civic affairs.
It is located on‘ the Forbes St.

Interfraternity Council Raises
$125 For Study Scholarship;
Kick’-Off Dance Draws 500

A capacity crowd of 500 persons attended the IF kick-
off dance Friday night at Pitt Stadium and contributed $125

to the “S” award fund.

The “S” award, which was established by IF Council
last year, enables a Pitt junior man to study abroad during

the summer.

Highlighting the intermission of
the dance was the awarding of a
trophy to Sigma .Alpha Epsilon
fraternity for the best entry in
the Pitt-Minnesota football poster
contest.

Because of the success of this
initial dance of the season, IF

.The fracas over women cheerleaders, which began at
Pitt almost before women‘ were invented, was wonlast
spring by the students who advocated a co—ed cheering
squad. ’

The ﬁnal result of this victory, or defeat as the case may
be, was viewed by’ the -student body as well as several
thousand others who converged at Pitt Stadium last Satur-

xday to see the Pitt—Minnesota game. The general feeling
which the crowd manifested toward the cheerleaders can
7 be summed up in a phrase.

They liked ’em. , .

And the reverse was true also, at least for the ﬁrst quar-
ter of the game. Some new cheers were tried and sounded
good down on the ﬁeld. The band cooperated with the
squad on several more while the gymnasts pinwheeled in
front of the stands. -

All of these things fall under the ambiguous term of
school spirit, a term which has served as the whipping
boy for almost every department of the school at one time

‘ or another.

Now the hue and cry will probably rise again with
the athletic factions and the cheering factions ﬁring staccato
bursts at each other across the untrampled grassﬁof the end
zone. .

They both have logical arguments.

But the recurring points dwelt upon by both groups
have been so time honored and so recurrent as to appear
almost as transparent and frail as a spider’s web. However,
a spider’s web serves a purpose. . Q ' I

Just as the dog runs in circles chasing the unreach-

able tip of his tail, so run the arguments after a humiliating
defeat. ‘ T

“We don’t cheer for a losing team,” recurs as a crutch

for the students’ while the athletes wobble on the other
crutch and shout. -»

“We won’t win if we don’t get your support.”

Meanwhile the crippled Panther, sorely in need of both
crutches toregain his feet, has been shoved to the back-
ground along with his“ pride, there to sit dejectedly and
listen to this infantile bickering between supposedly adult
groups. a A

The phrase may be trite, but a little cooperation would
not hurt matters a bit.

If you long for a life of ease, a

ble, ‘read no farther.

Because this column is about a
college newspaper, that training

w r i t e rs, re-

 

bers men, and
free - loaders.
True, the job
of working on
a news sheet
is always new,
s o m e t im e s

n e v e r dull,
but it is a job
in which no

 

one watches ‘clocks except at

deadlines.

You roll out of bed for your
classes and curse the dawn in the
same manner employed by count-
less students before you. iYou
dress, grab your books and head
for school and a quick cup of
coffee before that ﬁrst class.
When classes are over for the day
you walk into the news office and
promptly lose your identity as a
student as you become a working
part of the news room.

Rewrite and Legmen

The news editor hands you
some releases with pepciled no-
tations at the top. You feed copy
-paper into your typewriter and
go to work. This is called rewrite
and is just as essential as the big
story on page one.

Or you may be given an as-
signment which requires leg

If the story is a big onethe
photo editor or one of his staff
will accompany you. Youarrive
for your interview and the pho-

set up his shot. Get the story. Be
fast but be accurate. Look for a

Pictures Coming Up ’

Back to the news room and
you add your typing to the un-

reporters and rewrite men. The

photographer picks up another
assignment and , heads for the
darkroom for_some fresh ﬁlm.
You ﬁnish your story and drop
it in the copy basket on the news
desk. The copy desk staff is al-
ready beginning to check copy
for errors so you sit in at the

crossing out, inserting, correcting.
Then you hand it to the reader

again. ,

Somebody suddenly realizes
that newspaper men have to eat

Laws Made to Benefit Guilty

by Irv Rothman
Time: Present
Case: Misrepresentation or’

American justice
Defendant: Jack Webb’s

“Dragnet” .

Dum da-da dum!

Within the next few months
millions of theatre goers will see
the wide—screen production,
insist-
ence of friends who enjoyed Joe
Friday’s sarcasm and the me-
thodical hunt familiar to radio
and TV fans.

‘However, the movie plays hav-
oc with two basic concepts_ of

‘American justice: “innocence until

proven guilty” and “ﬁfth amend-
ment.” The‘ strong impression
made on a large screen is a re-
versal of our_ judicial thinking.

The awkward manner in which
the. grand jury freed suspects for
lack of evidence immediately con-
jures audience disfavor. Obvious-
ly stupid, jurors refused to indict
the criminals despite Jack Webb’s
protests.

Fifth Amendment Bluest

Fifth amendment received large
play as a defensive tool of the
criminal element. Movieland~dis-
torted the theory, “No person . . .

 

   
 

shall be compelled in any crim-
inal case to be a witness against
himself . . .”

Now let’s get the facts.

The IBM — min d e d detective
found himself momentarily
thwarted when the grand jury re-
fused to indict certain suspects.
While he recognized lack. of evi-
dence, Webb felt deep in his
heart they were guilty.

Dum da-da dum!

Yellow Turns Friday Red

As the mobsters completed jury
questioning, they dropped yellow
slips of paper into a wastebasket.
Friday conﬁscated the ﬁnd. Cam-
eramen installed close—up lenses
to bring out the wording, “I re-
fuse to testify on the grounds
that I might incriminate myself.”

Rushing to the District Attor-
ney with his discovery, the TV
ﬁlm-radio hero asked, “Why is it
that laws are made to beneﬁt the
guilty?”

Brilliantly, the mustached Mr:

District Attorney replied, “Be-
cause the innocent don’t need
them.”

Dum da‘-f-da dum!

Needless. to say, Webb’s sus-
picions were proven correct as
the show reached its ‘end an hour
and "half too late. Fate cheated

pages. The big news is-pulled
out and handed to the editor who
is making up page one. You ‘grab
a sheet of paper ‘and begin com-
-posing headlines for the stories.
You ﬁnish »a head only to ﬁnd
that it’s too long’ so you look
around for a shorter word which
will saythe same thing as "your
ﬁrst one,"
The photo editor drops a pile
of pictures on the copy desk‘ and F‘
begins to mark them forthe en'-
graver. Youcheck the sizes of the’
pictures which are scheduled for
-the page you’re working on and
‘find that you still have three
inches of blankspace. Soiyou look,
through. the “hold” copy ‘for a
story to ﬁll the space.

Make—up and Headlines
The phone rings and you hold

it for the associate editor. who,- 

takes "down the story. A quick
job of rewrite is followed by ‘a
double check thrdugh theifaculty.
and student directories for names.
Then you begin to look for stories
that can be’ “cut” to make room

Youcheck with the editor for
his O.K. and ﬁnd him grinding
out an editorial. He tells you to .
pull the story on page ﬁve, col-
. umn four. So you take it out and
out part of the. next _story to
make room. S ,
Suddenly you’re done. The pa-
-per is ready for the composing
room. You gather up the pages
and _put the paper to bed. You
leave with a couple of the staff
members for one last cup of
coffee. Youl’re sure it won’t keep

Sgt. Should TurnGendarme '

Joe Friday based his original ar-
rests on personal instinct.‘ If he
were a member of a continental
police‘ force he might well argue
the" decision of the jury. The de-
fense would be obliged to provide
the case. But citizens should be
provided freedom from on-the-
street search‘unless sufficient evi-'
dence merits a warrant. Such a
provision was a basic theory in’
our constitution, that made our
law different from European.

On the other hand, Fifth
amendment provides freedom from‘
coercion. Even in this age, the
rubber hose is used to effect con-
fessions. The amendment requires
prosecution to back up its claims
with concrete evidence. “Dragnet”
has impressed viewers with the
opposite concepts.

Jack Webb’s repartee provides

‘too poor a compromise with the

smear on American justice to
justify those misconceptions be-.

To Be Re-Affirmed
As representatives of our re-
spective institutions, Carnegie In-
’stitute of Technology, Duquesne
University, and Pennsylvania Col-
__lege for Women," we express con-
cern over the fact that on occa-
sions in past years? certain mem-
bers. of our student body have
visited other institutions in con-
nection with athletic celebrations
with consequent interruptions -to
the educational program and de-
struction of property. We express

the hope that such activities will

be discontinued in,» the future.

I Accordingly, we "resolve and
recommend to the leadership,
faculty, and students, at our re-
spective institutions that in’. in-'.
stances of visitationjto other cam-
-puses we assume financial respon-
sibility for any damage done, with
the exepense, insofar as it can be
established to be borne by ‘indi-

viduals identified as participants. 

, We further recommed, to the
Administrations of our respective
institutions that they deal severely
with any of their students who
violate the letter and spirit of this
understanding. To assure the suc-

’cess of the above resolution, we
propose that our respective insti-
tutions carry on a program of edu-
cation for the students in this
regard.

We further _recommend that all
possible publicity be given this
action at the different institutions,
and that it be approved and eﬂ‘ect-

ed by our respective student gov- I

ernments. '

FOOTBALL THROUGH THE AGES
The football frenzy is upon us. But let us, in ‘the midst of this

pandemonium, call time. Let us pause for a moment of tranquil
reﬂection. What is this game called football? What is its history?
Its origins? Its traditions? These are not idle questions, for when
we have the answers we will appreciate even more fully, enjoy even
more deeply, this great American game of football.

First of all, to call-football an American game is somewhat mis-
leading. True, the game is now played almost, exclusively in America,
but it comes to us from a land far away and 'a civilization long dead.

Football was first played in ancient Rome. Introduced by.Ju1ius
Caesar, it became one of the most popular Roman sports by the time
of Nero's reign. The eminent historian Sigafoos reports a crowd of
MMCLDDXVIII people at the Colosseum one Saturday afternoon
to see the Christians play the Lions. - ‘

With the decline of the Roman empire football fell into disuse.
The barbaric Hunt; and Goths preferred canasta. However, by the

-I Twelfth Century A.D.” football had emerged from its twilight and

risen to its rightful place in the ﬁrmament of European pastimes.
The eminent historian Sigafoos reports that the whole continent
was in the grip of wild excitement in the year 1192 when the
Crusaders, under‘ Freddie Barbarossa, journeyed all the way to
Damascus to play the Saracens in the Fig Bowl game. The Crusaders
squeaked through, 23 to 21, on a ﬁeld goal by Dick Coeur de Lion
in the closing seconds of the game. A

October 21, 1512, will ever remain a red letter day ‘in the history
of football. On that day Leonardo da Vinci, who has often been called
“The Renaissance Man” because of his proﬁciency in a hundred arts
and sciences, was painting a picture of a Florentine lady named
Mona Lisa Schultz- “Listen, Mona baby,” he said as she struck a

_ pose for herportrait, “I keep telling you—don’t smile. Just relax and

look natural.” -
“But I’m not smiling,” she replied.
“Well, what do you call it?” he said. ; _
k_“((1}e;,”I don’t know,” said Mrs. Schultz. “It’s just an expression,
in o . .
2 ‘‘Well, cut it out,” said The Renaissance Man.
“I’ll try,” she promised. . ~
And try she did, but without success, for a moment later the artist
was saying to her, “Look, Mona kid, I’m not gonna ask you again.
Wipe that silly grin off your face.” »
“Honest to goodness, The Renaissance Man,” said she to him, “it’s
no grin. It’s just the way I look.” —
h “Well, just stop it,” said Leonard testily and turned away to mix
is pigments. » c
When he turned back to Mona Lisa and saw the smile still on
her face, he became so enraged that he seized the nearest object —-
a casava melon, as it happened— and hurled it at her with all his
strength. Showing great presence of mind, she caught the melon and
ran lwiith lit from the studio until The Renaissance Man’s temper
s ou coo .
This was, of course, the ﬁrst completed forward pass.

Another date dear to the hearts of all football fans is September 29,

1442. It was on this date, according to the eminent historian Sigafoos,
that a sixteen year old lad named Christopher Columbus tried out
for the football team at Genoa Tech. He failed to make the team

‘because he was too light. (He weighed at that time only 12 pounds.)

And why, you ask, is this date - September 29, 1442 —_ so dear to
the hearts of all football fans? Because young Columbus was so
heartbroken at not making the team that he ran away to sea. And
if that hadn’t happened, he never would have discovered America.
And if Columbus hadn’t discovered America, the world never would
have discovered tobacco. And if the world hadn’t discovered tobacco,
football fans never would have discovered Philip Morris -- which, as
every fan knows, is the perfect companion to football. As Sigafoos,
the eminent historian, says, “Land’s sakes, I can’t even imagine
football without Philip Morris. I’d sooner go to a game without my
raccoon coat than without my neat, rich tobacco-brown snap-open

pack of mild vintage Philip Morris Cigarettes which come in regular T

or king-size at prices young and old can afford. Land’s sakes!”

».

The end of football in Europe came with the notorious “Black Sox
Scandal” of 1587, in which Ed Machiavelli, one of the Pisa mob,
paid off the University of Heidelberg Sabres to throw the champion-
ship game to the Chartres A. and.M. Gophers. It was a mortal blow
to football on the continent.

But the game took hold in the American colonies and thrived as it
had never thrived before. Which brings us to another date that
remains evergreen in the hearts of football lovers: December 16, 1771.

On that date a British packet loaded with tea sailed into Boston
harbor. The colonies had long been smarting under the English king’s
tax on tea. “Taxation without representation,” they called it, and
feelings ran high.

When on December 16, 1771, the British ship docked at Boston, a

» semi-pro football team called the Nonpareil Tigers, coached by

Samuel (Swifty) Adams, was scrimmaging near the harbor. “Come,
lads,” cried Swifty, seeing the ship. “Let’s dump the tea in the ocean!”
With many a laugh and cheer the Nonpareil Tigers followed Swifty
aboard and proceeded to dump the cargo overboard in a wild, dis-
organized and abandoned manner. “Here now!” called Swifty
sharply. “That's no way to dump tea overboard. Let’s\ get into some
kind of formation.” ‘ .
And that, fans, is how the “T” formation was born.

Panthers A§_._i_m

 

 

Booters Prep
For Rockets

Making their first road trip of
the season, the new Panther soc-
cer team travels to Slippery Rock
Saturday for what Coach Leo
Bemis considers one of the tough-

_ est matches on the schedule.

Playing on a club basis last
year, the Panther booters lost
twice to the Slippery Rock Teach-
ers. Early in the season the Rock-
ets shut out the Pitt kickers 4-0.
However, in the second match, the
improved Panthers gave a much
better showing against the Rock-
ets before succumbing 4-3.

Coach Bemis has rated Slippery
Rock among the three strongest

for Irish Stars

Notre Dame Strikes No
Fear After Minnesotans

By GENE AROMATORIO «

The Irish are coming but the Panthers aren’t running.
After that 46-7' pasting handed them by the Golden Gophers
from Minnesota, the Panthers should be able to take anything
—-even Guglielmi and company.

It’s too bad that local fans will not get to see such All-
Americans as Johnny Lattner, Neil Worden, Art Hunter, and
Don Penza, who performed here two years .ago. However,
the colorful Irish are never with-6
out stars.

Leading the Notre Dame
eleven, and already being hail-
ed as All-Americans, will be
two ﬁne backs, Ralph Gugliel-
mi and Joe Heap. Guglielmi
does - the signal-calling, and
passing from his quarterback ‘
post while Heap runs and
catches from the left halfback
spot.

Heap, who is seeking his fourth
Notre Dame football ‘monogram,
is a ﬁne broken—ﬁeld runner in
addition to being an excellent pass-
catcher. Two years ago against
the Panthers, Heap reeled off a
93-yard punt return and last year
did a repeat ‘performance against
Southern California.

Handling the end positions for
the Irish will be co-captains Dan
Shannon and Paul Matz who will
team with Heap to take care of
Gug1ielmi’s passes.

Last year’s game between the
two rivals ended in a last quar-
ter 23-14 victory for the Irish.
Saturday will mark the 22nd
meeting between the two schools

-‘Filbert Asks
Some Questions

a By nAvI§ MAZER
Sports Editor

 

9

Filbert is a ‘Boy Scout. Being a member of this famous
order, he attended last Saturday’s game at the Stadium as
the guest of the management since Boy Scout Day was pro-
claimed ‘for the home opener. _

It was on the long trek down the hill after the contest
that I encountered this khaki-clad youngster. It seemed that
he needed company while walking down to get a streetcar
and I; was the one picked out as the conversationalist.

, After preliminary questions as to if’ I was a student at
Pitt, he proceeded to ask questions that showed that for a
freckle—faced kid just going into his teens, he knew quite a
bit about the game. V _ I

“How come all those Minnesota: guys were catchingthose

passes?” he inquired. This at ﬁrst sort of set me back but '

the answer soon came out. Pass defense, I explained, is one
of the hardest things to teach in football and this could very
well be one ofthe weaknesses of this year’s squad. I

Not satisﬁedwith this reply, he countered with “Then
why didn’t we throw all them passes like they did and
maybe they couldn’t knock ours down either?”

’ Well, this Filbert kid was getting to be a real problem
but with the end of the de-
scent still far ahead, I had_no
choice but to continue or
brush ‘the youngster off, and
lose a potential Pitt student.

My retort this time was
What Minnesota Coach Mur-
ray Warmath said after the
battle-—“Our boys were really
rushing the passer and many
times forced him to throw off-
for a huge loss.” That ought

 

balance to avoid being thrown
to show this brash punk. ,

But Filbert wasn’t done. “One more question,” he said.
“How come we didn’t stick in some new guys after they
made all those touchdowns?’’V ,

Realizing that this would be the end of the junior league
third degree, I rolled into this with”vigor. “You see, Fil-
bert, our coach probably ﬁgured that the fellows on the
bench couldn’t do any better than the ones out there or
else he would h_ave put them in” was my angered retort.“

’_“You don’t have to get mad about it,” he shot back,
“this was the ﬁrst football game I’ve seen in person and I
don’t know all about it yet. The only reason I came was be-
cause my Scoutmaster told us we could get in for free.”

With this, my downhill companion crossed the street to
catch his streetcar. An,d,iI was left with the thought that
he probably would have"told'me he totally-disliked this game
except that his Scoutmaster might “ deplore this‘ as bad
conduct. Yep, Filbert is a Boy Scout all right.

While the Panthers were help-

th eir slippery ﬁngers, the
Gophers were also busy help-
ing themselves to seven touch-
downs-—ﬁve in the second half.

In the seemingly endless second
half, the Pitt defense came wide
open, allowing ﬁve touchdowns
with only six ﬁrst downs while
getting only one first down them-
selves. X '

Up to date, after 120 minutes of

Baird Studies at Edinburgh

Toured_S_cotland,

Germany, France

By FA_YE HINKES
Patricia Baird, president of the
senior women’s class, will proba-
bly be doing the Highland Fling
for the rest of her life as a re-
sult of her tour of Scotland this

‘past summer.

Pat, who won a scholarship from
the Committee of Educational Ex-
change last spring, traveled and
studied abroad for ﬁve weeks,
principally in Scotland, England,
Germany, Switzerland, Italy, and
France. »

At the University of, Edinburgh
she studied the “Development of

,M o d e 1‘ n Western Civilization.”

This course included lectures by
men from the three main Scottish
universities, Edinburgh, St. An-
drews, and Aberdeen. _ ‘
Learned Scottish Dances
Pat. described student life as
“just a little diﬁerent than ours.”
In the evenings, instead of going
to the movies or watching tele-
vision, the students either listen-
ed to chamber music from touring
musicians, or watched and learn-
ed Scottish dances from visitors
at the hostle.

“Student housing facilities at

Edinburgh are much like our
American dormitories, but they
are called hostels,” Pat explain-
ed. At Carlyle Hostel, she met
students from 14 different na-
tions, all studying at Edinburgh
for the summer. They took ex-
cursions to nearby places such as
Lochlomond, the Border Abbies
which are castle ruins, and the
birth place of Sir Walter Scott.

Kilts, the latest campus fad and

well-known Scottish dress, are not
worn all the time as most Amer-
icans think, Pat said. They are
usually worn for festive occasions
or by country folk who come into
the cities on Sundays.
Toured German Sectors

After school was over, Pat

toured the highlands and then
ﬂew to Bonn, Germany, for ten
days. Later she joined a* YMCA
world’s tour in Berlin and toured
both the East and West, sectors of
Germany.

- The group was guided by Ger-
man students of the free univer- ’
sity. They establishedthe uni-
versity to get away from Com-
munist dictatorship.

Pat_ and the group went to

Geneva, Switzerland, to see the

Palace of Nations, the largest
building in Europe and the orig-

’ inal home of the UN. She also had

a chance to join in the group con-
ference with some of the 82 in-
ternational organizations. ‘

In evaluating her summer ex-
perience, Pat said she was proud
of Pitt . for its international
awareness, but still saw a great
need for international under- ,
standing.,“The experience of this
past summer can never, for me,
have a beginning or an ending,
for it is something which will be
a constant inﬂuence onmy life,”
she concluded.
