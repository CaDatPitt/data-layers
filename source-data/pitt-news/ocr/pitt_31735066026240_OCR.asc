Bus provides opportunities stu rents aren't taking

Cathleen O’Ma||ey
For The Pitt News

“The wheels on the bus go ‘round
and ‘round”  so why is no one rid-
ing?

On Sunday afternoons at 1:20
p.m., the drizzly strip of the Bigelow
Boulevard bus stop often has the quiet
essence of a city asleep.

In the microcosm of college, where
the typical weekend starts on Thursday
afternoon and ends four days later in a
15-hour nap of recovery, Sunday can
be easily wasted in a blur of hangover
and last-minute cramming, keeping
students in their rooms and the area’s
cultural hotspots poorly attended.

This seemed to be the case last
weekend as my roommate and I, for
the fifth Sunday in a row, waited
patiently for our free ride on
PATransit’s Cultural Bus into the heart
of downtown Pittsburgh’s cultural dis-
trict.

“Free ride? I’m in,” my roommate
had proclaimed, pleasantly surprised to
find another service made available
with just a ﬂash of her Pitt plastic.

Considering the Cultural Bus" con-
venience, we were struck by the num-
ber of empty seats that greeted us once
we hopped aboard; in fact, the 10-
minute ride from Oakland to

Downtown was practically a trip in a

private car.

Such has been a frequent experi-
ence on PATransit 17U Cultural Bus;
this service, free to students with a Pitt
ID, has remained widely underused,
despite its inception last semester.
While ridership has virtually doubled
since Feb. 1, PATransit still reports an
average of only 105 riders per week -‘-
and not all of them are Pitt students.

For a student body that consistent-

CATHl.EEN O'MALLEY/FORITHE Pm News

ly gripes about the lack of Oakland
entertainment, such statistics suggest
that creative cultural options are not
being fully explored, and that the ease
with which a lazy Sunday can be trans-
formed into an urban adventure is
greatly underestimated.

Provided in conjunction with the
PittArts program, the Cultural Bus
runs from noon to 6 p.m. in a continu-

ous loop between Oakland, North Side,

and Downtown, depositing willing cul-
ture—seekers anywhere from Heinz
Hall, home of the Pittsburgh
Symphony Orchestra; the Mattress
Factory, six—stories of funky, site—spe—

. cific art installations and day—glo man-

nequins; and the H. John Heinz
History Center, the museum of
Pittsburgh history which is inaccessi-
ble by any other bus route.

According to Jen Saffron, the
PittArts coordinator, the PittArts and
Cultural Bus programs were spawned
in a much—needed attempt to “bolster
the cultural citizenship” of both the
student body, and the neighboring
community.

While the number of people riding
the PATransit Cultural Bus falls well
below Saffron’s goal of 300 to 400 rid-
ers per week, PittArts has given rider-
ship a boost over, the past few weeks.

Last weekend, 47 students attend-
ed the Andy Warhol Museum for free
on a PittArts excursion. 

According to Saffron, even coordi-
nators within the College of"Arts and

- Sciences are making plansto share the
bus with PittArts next year in “an
attempt to better relations between fac-
ulty and students.”

Despite the current low numbers,
however, Saffron emphasizes that this
pilot project is on a rise, and that there
is no talk of discontinuing it.

Sodexho employees listen to student ccns with thei foo services.

Students vs. Sodexho

Christal Hall
Staff Writer

Sodexho employees and students met
yesterday to discuss their dilferencesz The
employees are paid to be here and the sur-
dents pay to be here.

Abdou Cole, a manager at Schenley
Cafe, said the meeting was an attempt to
solve the problems between the food service
employees and students.

Adam Tekel of the Student
Government Board was one of the four stu-
dents who represented the student body in
the meeting. Tekel said many students say
they are often ignored and must wait to be
served because employees hold private con-
versations with fellow employees. He also
said many students ﬁnd the workers
unfriendly.

“I remember the time when a friend of
mine dropped a soda on the ground,” Tekel
said “When the woman came to clean it up,
she gave us a big stink about it.”

Another concern that students have,
Tekel said, is the high cost of food that stu-
dents think lacks good taste and quality. He
said he would like to see a wide variety of
main-course selections and that he was
going to work with Sodexho to put together
multicultural meals.

Cole said he was going to try to assist
the students by having managers walking
through the dining areas and addressing
problems. He also said that all employees
should wear name tags so students can iden-
tify them when making formal grievances.

Cole said he tries to help students when
they complain, but that many students aren’t
cooperative. »

“I’ve received calls ﬁom students with a
complaint, and they don’t give me the per-
son’s name, and they don’t want to corrre in
to show me the person,” Cole said “What
am I suppose to do?”

Betsy Sallade-Farina, director of food
services, said she deals with students and
parents when they are upset. She told the
employees to be aware that they are being
watched

“Ithinkit’sapopularthingtodo——-to
bash on food services,” said Phil Kerpen,
another student representative at the meet-
ing. “[For example] these unfounded stories

in The Pitt News about bloody bacon. I don’t
know about you, but I’ve never seen bloody
bacon.”

Sa]lade—Farina told employees to not to
let complaints set them back but to simply
learn from them.

Cole said the employees think man-
agers are on the customers’ side. He assured
the employees that he would support them if
they handle situations in a professional man-
ner, astheyareexpectedtoact.

“Not all of us are bad seeds,” said
Deborah Smith, a Sodexho employee at the
meeting.

Cole reminisced about the worst cus-
tomer he had during the orientation period,
in which a man told him the ﬁsh was cold
and he started to make a scene. Cole said he
toldthemanthathewouldgivehimafree
meal in addition to a refund According to
Cole, the man said, “Give me the goddamn
meal.” Cole told the man to come back the
next day and everything would be much bet-
ter.

The man returned the next day and
said, “Oh, everything is OK.” Cole said the
man’s wife came up to him to apologize and
toldhimthatthemanwasthe same wayat
home.

“We’re not all horrible,” Sodexho
employee Audrey Costello said

Sallade-Farina said they had a surprise
inspection from Pizza Hut, and Betty
Tessauro —— the employee working at the
time —— received a 98 out of 100 rating.

Kathleen Chapman, a Sodexho
employee, described herself as “the sensitive
one” in Schenley.

“I almost broke out into tears when I
read that Pitt News article,” Chapman said
“I say ‘Hi’, and sometimes I don’t get one
bac ”

Smith said she thinks that food services
is doing a great job.

“I’ve been to some places when the
employees don’t wear aprons, uniforms or
hair nets,” Smith said.

Sallade-Farina said 5,600 people come
through Schenley Cafe on a daily basis.

“Ifone bad thing happens, it’s all around
the whole building,” Smith added

Cole said he holds these type of meet-
ings every Tuesday at 2 p.m. and that stu-
dents are welcome.

Four dead after Arkansas
middle school shooting spree

Across the Nation

J ONESBORO, Ark. —Sheriff
Dale Haas says it’s the worst thing
he’s ever seen.

Haas says victims of yester-
day’s shootings outside a ‘middle
school in Jonesboro, Ark., “Were
lying all over the place on the
ground.”

Two boys are accused of open-
ing fire on students and teachers as
they emptied out of the school dur-
ing a false fire alarm. ” .

Officer‘Natt Terry says polic ,
had to disarm two boys they caught
in a wooded area near the school.
Terry says they were armed with
both handguns and riﬂes with clips.
The alleged gunmen, who are 11
and 13 years old, are in the coun-
ty’s juvenile detention center. Terry
says he recognizes one of the boys
from a DARE program he teaches.

Sheriff Haas says 13 female
students and two teachers were
shot. Four of the victims have died.
Haas says he has “no idea” who set

» off the fire alarm that emptied the

school before the shooting started.

DALY CITY, Calif. —— A 25-year-
old mother is being held without
bail in the deaths of her three
daughters aged 7, 3 and 2.

Police in Daly City say Megan
Hogg suffocated her children with
duct tape.

The children were found by
their grandparents.

Police Lt. Steven Lowe said
Hogg suffocated the girls one by
one.

Authorities said the mother left
two notes discussing her plans,
then took what turned out to be a
non-lethal dose of prescription
drugs.

She was found unconscious in
her home with her dead children.
She was sent from a hospital to jail,
where she’s being held for psychi-
atric evaluation.

ATLANTA — A former FBI agent
says he has evidence that may sup-
port a conspiracy theory in the
assassination of Martin Luther
King, Jr.

Donald Wilson impounded
James Earl Ray’s car and now tells
reporters he kept two slips of paper
from it. Those papers may bolster
Ray’s claim that others were
involved in the killing 30 years ago
this week.

Wilson met with an Atlanta
prosecutor yesterday and said he

wants to give the slips directly to
U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno.
Wilson wouldn’t show reporters
a photocopy of the papers. But the
Atlanta J ournal-Constitution reports
the papers list the name “Raoul”
with slightly differing spellings.
Ray has insisted that he was set
up by a gunrunner named Raoul,
but no independent evidence of his
existence has ever been found.

MILES TOWNSHIP, Pa. — The
coroner in Centre County, Pa., says
the 11 people killed in a cabin fire
over the weekend were overcome
before the fire reached its peak.

Scott Sayers confirmed the ini-
tial analysis: All the victims died of
carbon monoxide poisoning. All
were overcome when the fire that
consumed the cabin was relatively
small.

The cause of the fire remains
unknown.

All 11 of the victims.were stu-
dents or recent graduates of two
central Pennsylvaniahigh schools.

A state transportation supervi-
sor passed the mountain cabin just
after 3 a.m. Sunday and saw noth-
ing unusual. When fire officers

< arrived two hours later, the two-

story building was fully engulfed.

BURLINGTON, Vt. —- A Vermont
man is being questioned in connec-
tion with two mysterious packages
sent to the offices of two senators.
The packages were received by
aides of John Glenn and James
Jeffords. The packages allegedly
contained gunpowder and threats
against former president Ronald
Reagan.

NEW YORK — “The Communist
Manifesto” may be making a come-
back.

This year marks the 150th
anniversary of the work by Karl
Marx and Friedrich Engels. A styl-
ish new edition is being _repub-
lished for release in New York and
London on May 1.

May Day used to be a big event
in the Soviet Union and other com-
munist states. ‘

Publisher Colin Robinson says
the book’s description of a capital-
ist system prone to shocks and con-
vulsions captures today’s mood.

A Communist Party spokes-
woman in New York says it wasn’t
too long ago that everyone was say-
ing communism was dead. And
now, she says, here it is, resurrect-
ed.

KLAYMAN

said that because her family knows
people who live in the Pittsburgh area,
she was angry that The Pitt News and
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette had each
reported on her son’s activities.

The University Judicial Board
recently concluded that the students
had committed the acts based on doc-
uments turned up in an investigation
by Pitt Police and Pitt’s Internal Audit
Department, Gallagher said in an
interview last week.

Klayman is the former allocations
chair —— who heads the committee that
distributes funds to student groups.

He was suspended from Pitt for
three years because of his involvement
in the fraud.

Gaspari, Klayman’s roommate,
was an allocations board member and
president of the Panther Automobile
Lovers Club —-— one of the groups
investigated by the University. He was
suspended for a year.

Gallagher said the other three stu-
dents still enrolled at Pitt were sus-
pended a semester to a year, based on
the extent of their involvement in the
offense.

FROM PAGE 1

Along with the suspensions, they»

all must return the money, according
to Gallagher.

Gaspari said he is sorry about
what he did and hopes to eventually
return to Pitt. _

“I got my punishment. It’s over
with. I want to go on with my life,” he
said in a phone interview. Still a
junior, Gaspari said he has a year and
a half of classes to take before he
graduates.

Klayman had only three months
left before graduation, his mother
said. She claimed the University was
too harsh in suspending him for three
years.

She would not comment on what
her son’s plans for the immediate
future may be but said, “One day,
eventually, he’d like to finish at Pitt.”

Both Gaspari and Ms. Klayman
said the public should let the embez-
zlement issue drop.

Gaspari admitted that he ‘‘pled
guilty” to Pitt’s Judicial Board
charges. When asked if he was sorry
about what he did, Gaspari responded:
“Obviously.”

Ms. Klayman claimed the ongoing
coverage of the scandal is an effort to
“pressure” her son into revealing the
names of the other offenders.

“[Gerald] will‘ never tell you who
they are. They are his friends,” she
said.

She admitted that she was shocked ‘

that her son would try to use his posi~
tion as allocations chair to defraud the
University.

“It mortified us. We were horri-
fied,” she said. “But he is the one who
has to live with himself.”

  ake your!!!  
best argument

Attention student groups: Friday marks the
deadline for budget appeals. If the Student
Government Allocations Committee did not give
you everything you requested for the next ﬁscal
year, Friday will be your last chance to ﬁle an
appeal with the Board. Then, after ﬂre SGB meet-
ing next Tuesday, your appeal will be heard, and the

Board will decide whether to override the

Allocations Committee's decisions.

So get busy preparing your appeals, and make
them good.

The student activities fund is meant to be used,
but it has to be shelled out responsibly. After this
past year's spending mistakes, this Board will prob-
ably be very careful and sparing in giving more
money out, as it should be. .

So don't be surprised orupset if you don't get
everything in your heart's desire, because not every
group can: SGB has about $300,000 to give out,
and about double that was requested.

If you have a legitimate reason to believe your
group needs or deserves more money, then by all
means, ﬁle an appeal. But your argument should be
compelling to convince SGB that you are more
deserving of the money than somebody else.

The Board will likely want to know exactly
what you plan to do with the money, perhaps
expecting a far more detailed explanation than you
think is possible. For example, perhaps you plan to
bring in several guest speakers over the year but

will not be able to plan each visit more than a few '

weeks in advance.

You still have options: Put together a portfolio
to demonstrate the caliber of speakers you've host-
ed in the past year. Or a description of what you
plan to accomplish this year, even if an exact sched-
ule is not known. Or better yet, bring both.

But remember, you are competing for this
money, not just with the other student groups, but
with the memory of last year that brought with it
many spending mistakes and poor judgments.

If this SGB does what is best for everyone, it
will make‘ successful appeals Very challenging to
come by.

Recently, The Pitt News asked
Marc Nuzzo what would happen if
William Shakespeare were in college

glance at that image:

(The play opens in a dorm room

at a fictional Pittsburgh university
where Monicker; a ﬁfth-year early-
American quilting studies major;
wakes up and boks outside her win-
dow.)
Monicker: Alas, to get up or not to get
up out of bed, for such a fair and foul

answers. It is F ostero, her sophomore
boyfriend.)

Monicker: How now, Fostero. Where
for art thou?

Fostero: I be in the ye olde lobby and
wait upon you -with whom to eat. If it
pleaseth you, I say. i .
Monicker: Zounds! You bet you

Fostero: Looketh at my eats, woman.

Monicker: What's in a name? That
which they call a steak by any other
name would still as resemble a hockey
-puck and be as devoid of appetize-
ment.

Baltire vs.
Cleveland rivalry
could get ugly

The rivalry returns.

Thanks to an ofﬁcial proclamation by
the NFL owners, the Cleveland Browns
will re—enter the National Football
League beginning in 1999.

They will again be the Hatﬁelds to I

our city’s McCoys, the Moriarty to our
Sherlock, the Dunn to our Cranmer and
the Andre the Giant to our Hulk Hogan.

The Steelers season will once again
be complete. Unfortunately the Browns
and their fans won’t care; they’ll have
bigger ﬁsh to fry.

Or, in this case, birds. Imagine this
future article, if you will:

CLEVELAND, OHIO — October
1999.

Cleveland Browns’ ofﬁcials ofﬁcially
apologized this morning for the televi-
sion difﬁculties experienced by viewers
attempting to watch the Browns-
Baltimore Ravens contest yesterday
afternoon.

According to a high-ranking Browns
officer, the noise of the Cleveland crowd
— 78,000 strong inside the recently built
Nike/USAirways/Budweiser Frog
Stadium designed to seat 72,000 ——- was
enough to shatter the lenses of the CBS
cameras, forcing the television audience
to rely solely on the commentary of Greg
Gumbel and Marv Albert.

Said commentary was frequently
interrupted by the loud chants of Browns
fans, most of which were fairly vulgar
and directed at Ravens’ owner Art
Modell or members of his immediate
family.

Fans watching at home missed a 31-3
Browns victory, highlighted by a 200-
yard rushing performance by Cleveland
running back Jerome Bettis. Browns
quarterback Bernie Kosar threw for two
touchdown passes, and scored another
six points by wheeling his wheelchair
into the end zone on a naked bootleg late
in the third quarter.

The Ravens, now 4-1 on the season,
also made an official announcement fol-
lowing Sunday’s game, planning a $200
million lawsuit against the Cleveland
fans for “throwing objects at the bench,
taunting the Baltimore players, and
hanging Vinny Testaverde from the Nike
Stadium rafters before the game started.”

Testaverde suffered no permanent
injury from the public hanging, rescued
by reluctant Cleveland police ofﬁcers

At his natural weight of
175 pounds, former Pitt
wrestler Larry. Sprecher did not
appear one bit overweight. In
fact, he had the lean, muscular
build of a Division—I wrestler.

But like every wrestler, he
needed to drop to a lighter

0 weight class to be competitive.

So Sprecher undertook a stren-
uous workout and diet regimen
to shed 25 pounds to get to the
150-pound weight class, where
he started for the ﬁrst part of the
1996-97 season.

During the course of the
season he lost that starting spot,
and fueled by his desire to stay
in the lineup, he cut down to
142. That brought the total
amount of weight lost from his
starting weight of 175 to a
whopping 33 pounds, or the
weight of an average 3-year-
old.

This depiction is not an
everyday example of weight
cutting, but an extreme case of

In his quest to reach 142,
Sprecher ate just one meal a
day consisting of “a plate of
celery or some carrots and one

glass of water.” The little he
took into his body, coupled
with the incredible exertion of
his three intense daily work-
outs’, sparked this weight loss.
Each morning he’d get up,
put on his plastic sweatsuit, and
do sets of 200 jumping jacks,
100 sit-ups, and 100 pushups,
rest for a minute, then start the
cycle again. He’d do this for an

Although he was already
exhausted, the plastics came on
again for the day’s second
workout, the team’s regular
practice at 2 p.m., which usual-
ly included a two-mile run and
lots of live wrestling.

After practice Sprecher
would eat his “dinner,” do
some homework and take a
nap before the plastics came
out yet again.

At 10 p.m., security guards
would let him into the
Fitzgerald Field House, where
he’d work out for a couple
more hours. Jumping rope got
boring, so he tried different
things, like running sprints with
a heavy bag on his back

Gymnastics was not her

team has not been in the sport
for nearly as long as most gym-
nasts.

Her ﬁrst interest was ballet.
She started that graceful sport
at the age of ﬁve and stuck with
it until the age of 10 in her
hometown of Woodhaven,
Mich.

“That’s when my best
friend Andrea got me interested
in gymnastics,” said Crisi.

Her parents always sup-
ported her in whatever decision
she made, and since gymnastics
was what she wanted, that was
what she got.

By the age of 10, most seri-
ous gyrrmasts have been train-
ing and competing for at least
ﬁve years. This did not matter
to Crisi.

“I was‘ slightly a tomboy
when I was younger,” said the

gynmast. “I always played with
my older brother David and his
friends.” This was a contributed
to her ability to endure a difﬁ—
cult sport that she was entering
rather late.

VVith all this energy she
possessed as a hyper child, she
began to excel in her new love.

But Crisi’s training was
another obstaclethe late starter
had to deal with. She started
training at a gym that went
bankrupt in a year. Her coach
found her a new training facili-
ty, where she spent a year
before moving on to the local
branch of the Gym of America.

She was a member of Gym

her high school did not have a

Melucci enters third season as Pitt baseball's tarting shortstop

Matt Mento
Staff Writer

In baseball, the job of the shortstop is
to cover as much ground as he can
between the third baseman and second
base.

This involves going deep into the hole
behind the third baseman’s reach or way
up the middle behind second base. It
requires a strong arm, soft hands and
quickness.

On the Pitt Panther baseball squad,

1 this position requires Lou Melucci. His

%4\< >>N)‘ m ....o- ~

quickness and strong arm have made him
,j the squad’s starting shortstop for the past
'7 three seasons.

Melucci was recruited by Pitt in 1995
out of Clarks Summit, Pa. In his senior
year at Abington Heights High School, he

 impressed the college recruiters by leading

7 his team to a district title. He came to Pitt

the summer after the Panther baseball
team won the Big East Tournament. “The
 main reason why I came here,” Melucci

 said, “was because the team was real

8 good”

l\./Ielucci wasted no time in making a
name for himself as a key contributor to
the team. In his freshman season, he

 played in 43 games, starting 38 at either
\ shortstop or second base, and hitting .285.

V; He tacked on six multiple—hit games,
including three—hit performances against
Thomas More College and Indiana

, University of Pemisylvania.

In his sophomore campaign, he hit
even better, posting a .293 average with 28

his 44 games played. Melucci also learned
how to bring in the runners on base, rank-

l

ing third on the team with 30 RBIs —-— 12
up from the season before. His range at
shortstop was made apparent as he led the
team with 115 assists.

This season, one of Melucci’s main
goals is to improve his defensive skills. As

21.
“Last season I made too many errors,
and as a shortstop, my role on the team is

‘X a sophomore, he led the 1997 squad with

ldefense,” he said. “Whatever happens ~

 with the bat is a plus.”

So far, Melucci’s bat has been a big
plus. He leads the team with 11 hits in as
many games.

He is batting .262 with a pair of dou-
bles, a home run and four RBIs. He has
three-multiple hit games, one of which

was against Big East foe Georgetown last

1, weekend 

‘ Lately Meluociihas beenibat11n' g  

ond in the order, behind center ﬁelder

, Kevin Foley (.303), whom he credits with

i his high RBI totals.

Sophomore third baseman Steve
Varshire, Melucci’s occasional inﬁeld-
mate, called Melucci not only a ﬁne
ballplayer, but also a team leader.

“Lou is solid defensively, a consistent
hitter,” he said. “The players look up to
him. He is soft spoken. ‘He basically lets

THE PITT News

his actions in the ﬁeld speak for him.”

So far on the ﬁeld, Melucci has had
his share of difficulty, currently leading the
team in errors with seven. He could face
more trouble later this season and next
season, as the University plans to literally
take the ﬁeld out from underneath his
shortstop position.

“Next season we should be getting
dirt in the inﬁeld, and eventually AstroTurf
in the future,” said Melucci.

This season, Melucci will have some
exposure to turf inﬁelds; the Panthers’
tl1ree—game set against the Irish of Notre
Dame will be played at Three Rivers
Stadium.

Melucci isn’t complaining. Trees

Melucci emphasized that the Big East
contests against the Irish will be key
games.

“Notre Dame is at the top of the Big
East this year,” he said. “They are the
cream of the crop.”

While the team currently rests at 1-1
in the conference (4-7 overall), Melucci
stresses that it is still early, and there are
many opportunities left to capitalize on.

RECRUITING UPDATE: Many Panther
basketball fans are wondering who Head
CoachRalphW]lardwillluretoPittwiththe
ﬁnal scholarship available for next season.

After watching point guard Vonteego
Cummings average the most playing time in
Big East history last season, many fans want
toseeanewpointguardatPitttogive
Cummings some rest his senior year. In
addition, a new ball handler needs to take
over Cummings’ spot at the helm of the
offense after he leaves.

Other fans hope Willard brings in a true
center (a player at least 6-foot-10) so that 6-
foot-8 Isaac Hawkins doesn’t have to contin-
ually guard opposing centers as large as 7-
foot-1, 270-pound Rafal Bi gus of Vllanova.

Sprecher would lie down for bed, with
his unrelenting hunger chewing away at his

yet he would start the process once again.

While all wrestlers are heavier at match

because I was so short-tempe .”
Sprecher described the experience as
miserable but says it deﬁnitely taught him
discipline.
“When you’re so dehydrated and

you’re just so thirsty and you’re standing‘

next to a water fountain and want to take a
drink but don’t, that’s discipline,” he said.

“Sometimes your mouth is so dry you
need to take a mouthful of water, swish it
around and spit it out. But to not swallow,
that’s discipline.”

Sprecher did reach 142. His body was
in such need of nourishment that he imme-

rer.

“Weighing in two hours before the
match is the way it always should have
been,” he said

Like Sprecher, Pitt Head Coach Rande
Stottlemyer thinks the new rules are work-
ing because he no longer has to make
health-related decisions, like whether a
wrestle staying on an exercise bike any
longer would be dangerous.

The NCAA’s new weight-cutting rules

‘have made conditions safer for the athletes,

but people involved in wrestling concede
that weight cutting will always be a part of
the sport.

ankle problems, she left the sport her
junior year in high school.

In the six years of her gynmastics
career before that, she established herself
as an extremely talented and very strong
gynmast. She was an AAU Nationals
(Junior Olympics) qualiﬁer four times. In
her sophomore year of high school she
went to USGF Nationals. It was an honor
for her to represent her region, which
included gymnasts from throughout the
Midwest. ‘She went to Florida for the "
USGF Nationals against some of the
count1'y’s top gymnasts.

Mounting back problems could not
keep Crisi from being active in some kind
of sport. During her junior year in high,
school she decided to join the varsity track .
team. She also was a member of the junior
varsity diving team.

Jack and Sandy Evanoff, Crisi’s for-
mer gymnastics coaches, persuaded her to
rethink her decision to quit gymnastics
after her junior season. She returned to
train with them her senior year in high
school. ’

“I was only out of gymnastics for four
months, but for this sport, that is a long
time not to be active,” said Crisi. “Since I
wasn’t training, I grew a lot.”

Now she had to overcome yet anoth-
er obstacle. She was 4-foot-7 in junior
high, and by the time she returned to gym-
nastics, she was almost 5-foot—4, prepar-
ing to re-enter a sport where tumbling

speed and quickness come easier smaller

athletes. V

Still, she had a great senior year. Crisi
qualiﬁed for the ﬁfth spot on the A Team
in USGT National. The A Team consists
of the top seven place gymnasts in the
Midwest region.

The athlete was recruited to
Pittsburgh by Coach Debbie Yohman who
viewed her as a “gynmast with a lot of
potential and talent.”

Crisi admitted that “Pitt was not my
ﬁrst choice.”

A trip to the campus changer her
mind quickly. “Pittsburgh was the best
recruiting trip I had, I liked the team
members a lot,” she said.

Since coming to the Pitt, she has been
a very active and important member of the

team. She has competed in every meet‘

this year, and is already tied for third place
in Pitt history books on the balance beam.

“My goal for next year is to become
an all-arounder (participating in all four
events],” said the freshman. All she needs
to do is add the vault to her competition.
Crisi started vaulting this year but had to
hold out on this event due to shin splints
and ankle problems.

The vault will wait for next year, and
the freshman will have three years to
develop her skills and attack other Panther
records — both individually and with her
teammates.

“The team just keeps getting stronger
and stronger,” said Crisi. “I am really
looking forward to the next "couple of
years.” —

COLUMN

after bystanders realized that the ﬁgure
at the end of the rope was not a man-
nequin but was, in fact, the Heisman
Trophy-winning quarterback.

The quarterback was not available
for comment. His backup, Jim Miller,
completed just three passes for 16 yards
on the afternoon, later complaining that
he couldn’t even hear his own signals
over the roar of the Browns fans.

“It was like playing a football game
in the middle of a KISS concert during.
an airplane takeoff,” Miller said.

Many fans complained of hearing
damage after the contest. Scalpers out-
side the gate charged $45 for upper-
level seats and $55 for earplugs.

Television reception began fading
just before kickoff, when fans stomping
on the newly constructed bleachers
knocked two CBS cameras (and cam-
eramen) off of their mounts. No injuries
were reported, but the NFL was notiﬁed
that instant replay would not be avail-
able for the contest. V

Thanks to the camera trouble, the
game lasted just over three hours,
instead of the average length of 6 and
one-half hours as a result of the rules
changing.

After the game, fans mobbed the
ﬁeld to show their support for the vic-
tors. As armored cars whisked the
Ravens to safety, fans uprooted both
goalposts and attempted to carry them

out of the stadium to toss them into
Lake Erie. They made it as far as the
water’s edge before the toxic fumes
from the lake (recently environmentally
deregulated by President Gingrich)
overwhelmed the goalposts’ carriers.
No injuries were reported.

However, marching the posts
through downtown Cleveland sparked a
Browns-induced riot, as “Death to the
Ravens” became the spray-painted
phrase of choice and the new decora-
tion on the windows of most 7-
Eleven’s.

“Sure I’ll have to spend a night in
jail, but it was well worth it,” said one
of the rioters. “It’s just a shame we
couldn’t get our hands on Modell. Long
live Bernie! Long live Bernie!”

One year after the city raised $250 ‘A

million _to pay for the now-damaged
Nike Stadium, this riot may force
Cleveland to pay double that sum.

The Browns are scheduled to play
the Steelers next Monday night at
home, renewing the teams’ age-old
rivalry. A sellout is expected (depend-
ing on length of sentencing), but securi-
ty ofﬁcials are not concerned about fur-
ther violence.

“It’s the Steelers,” security guard
Byron “Bam” Morris said. “They didn’t
resign anybody, as usual. What’s the big
deal?” -

Kevin Lilley is the sports editor of
The Pitt News and would love to be
covering professional football in 1999.
