JOHN R. JOHNSTON

THETA DELTAPSI
-GIVEN FAVORABLE
DECISION IN sun‘

That the recent victory .of Theta
Delta Psi, local fraternity, in legal
prpceedings against the city zoning
commission will probably have an im-
portant effect on another fraternities
on the.Pitt campus, was the belief. 01.’
several fraternity heads’ when _' the
common pleas court handed down the
favorable decision, recently. -

7 In deciding. the case, Judge"Ja.mes
MCF. Carpenter of the common pleas
court held that the petitionems, having
legal title on the premisesat .151

 

. North Dithridge street, may use it

without interference. The action of
theccourt reversed a ruling of the
zoning commission which stated that
a fraternity is not permitted to have
its house in “Class B” zones, which
are the residential sections of the
city. The zoning law was enacted in
the interest of the public health, safe-
ty and ‘general welfare- of the resi-
dents. “It is not, nor can it be, con-
tended that the occupancy of-a house
by a fraternity will be detrimental

to the. health, safety or welfare of the
“public,” stated Judge

Carpenter _ in

J commenting on t-he case._ He ‘went
on ‘to say that “we cannot assent to
‘the proposition that an occupancy

permit is a prerequisite to a lawful
occupancy by the membersdl’ the
Theta Delta Psi fraternity of the pre-
mises involved”. »

?

Not so cm; Dents‘!

 

Getting their .*“yanks” and
“twists” mixed, a few Dents
strolled into Soldiers’ Memorial ,
Hall when they saw the sign

outside, Plumbers register here.

The boys thought "free monkey
wrenches were being handed
out, but soon discovered that it
was only ,-a meeting of the
Plumbers’ Union. Infirmary pa-
trons ‘are now breathing peace-
fully. '

“GENERALé

A general attitude of indifference
on the part of the faculty, together
with volumns of comment by stu-
dents and alumni of the University.”
resulted from the article on “snap.”
courses, published in the last issue of
the Weekly. Derogatory criticism of
the method, together with praise of
the general idea of the story, was al-
most unanimously voiced by those
making comment. A stiffening of the
so-called “snaps” was noted by ‘stu
dents this week, however, in spite of
the lack of comment on the partﬁof

the faculty. , ’“
Professional comment centered
around statements by Dr. John W.

Oliver, head of the history depart-

,ment; Dr.  McKay, head. of the

economics depart.me1i~t; and,Dr. S. B.
"Linhart, -professor ‘in charge of the
course on the history of religion. All-3
of the departments concerned came
in ‘for n1_oI’:’e,_: or less? criticism -in the

his department rest upon its reputa-
tion. According to the history head,
hundreds of students have registered"
complaint against the criticism of the
history courses made last week, point-J
ing out that the student poll wasnoz
broad enough} ‘. .

 McKay, speaking for the econ-
omics department, agreed with the
‘purpose behind the ‘article, but re-
marked on the “ﬂippant.mode of the
He also believes that the
direct criticism of’ particular profes-

. sors was unnecessary.

Dr. Linhart stated: “The reason
we have so many students in our his-
tory or religion department is that
there is an increasing interest in mat-

ters of religion, which is also at work .

not bother, him, for he hasheard sim-
ilar‘ charges for ‘f_t11e past 20' Years,"
he stated. « ’

Other members of the faculty who
were named in connection ‘with the
“snap” courses showed a similar at-
titude, with several holding their com-
ment until later. _ _ .

Turning to student and alumni
comment, "general . condemnation of
the method used is found, though
some credit is given for the purpose
of the article. A characteristic let-
ter, written by C. v. Starrett, oo1.y24,
editor of the Panther in his under-
graduate days, seems to catch the
‘spirit of the student comment as a
whole. Starrett says: . -. '

"So faI',,so good. But as an alum»
nus long enough »out of school to have
acquired a small amount of perspec-

clusion of Dr. Francis Newton Thorpe
in the snap course category.

“It is true enough that a clever lad
can laze his way through a Thorpe
course. It is equally true that a stu-
dent interested in the business of ed-
ucation ﬁnds there an otherwise dry
subject illumined by the kindly wit
and charming personal sidelights of
the instructor. ‘

“It the good doctor lapses into
whimsical reminiscenses occasionally,

“There is .a__-great need today in

American Universities for more men _

For the ﬁrst‘. time in a number oi.’
years, Pitt’s ‘basketball team. suc-
ceeded ‘in ‘trimming -Washington and
JefVferso‘n twicein one season. Last
Friday night, at the stadium, the
Panthers scored their secondgvictory

‘and J. was a determined‘ .,out\ﬁt. ‘In-
cidentally, the‘ Pantheifsjsstrengthened
their hold on ‘the .leadership among
the. non-conference .Tri-State.‘ teams, 
‘As might be. expected. from_ two
teams -as evenly matched asvvere W.
and ‘J. and‘ Pitt, they played on ‘‘equal‘
terms for the ﬁrst ﬁve minutes. To-
ward’ the close of the ﬁrst quarter, the
—Panthers ‘gradually pulled away and,
when. the whistle blew at half time,
hadvthe advantage of a‘ 19 to 11_ tally.
Vjj Captain ‘Parsons Vpl_ayed.V. a stellar
role. He was the. high :point scorer

‘ .‘ with ﬁve ﬁeld go.als"‘.and two fouls.

Perhaps Pitt intentially letdown a
little in the second ‘period,'..but at any
Vrate the visitors played a little better.
The Presidents. remained »intact
throughout the ‘eVntire.g.am‘e, not one
substitution being made. Pitt_ used
