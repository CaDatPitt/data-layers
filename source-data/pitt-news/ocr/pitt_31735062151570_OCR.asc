First-Year Men Meet Leaders

Life At Kan-0-Kwee
In Zelienople Woods
Lures New Students

By Robert Brown

A-nnu-ally, as a sort of prel-
ude to campus ‘life, incoming
men students have a «chance to
meet upperclassmen, fall in the
creek, recognize faculty mem-
bers, get a slant on activities,
and learn the University songs
and cheers. All of this can
mean only one thing —_— Fresh-
man Camp is here again.

Established six years ago by the
University YMCA, the primary pur-
pose of the camp_
has been to supply
the new student
with advance in-
formation about
the newsetting in"
which he will ﬁnd
himself and which
will enable him
better to orient
himself in -college
life. However, the

giving the fresh-
man an opportu- ,_
nity for personal
contacts with the
leading members of faculty and stu-
dent body, besides helping to make
friendships among the new students
themselves. _ I
Faculty Participates
Directing the activities this year,
which will be held at Camp Kon-O-
kwee, near Zelienople, from Friday,
September 18, through Sunday, Sep-
tember 20, is Louis Bearer, CE37.

director of instrumental music at the
University, will -also provide enter-
tainment, and there will be mushball,
tennis, swimming, .and, if Connoque-
nessing Creek hasn’t dried up, boat-
ing. The new men will be given a
further chance to get “in the know”
concerning University life at the Sat-
urday night “bull session” when up-
perclass counselors, representing pub-
lication units, military groups, self-
government associations, fraternities,
and various other student groups give
advice on how to break into activities.

portation to the camp are requested

Mentors To Greet
Freshman Women
As Customs Begin

High Tea At Hotelschenley
Will Terminate Events
For Opening Day

Green armbands, the first step in
a freshman woman's introduction to

the customs and traditions of Uni- , .

versity women, will be placed on
the arms of the freshman women
at an assembly sponsored by the cus-
toms committee of the Women’s Self
Government Association this after-
noon at 12 :45 -o’clock at Heinz
House. Members of the class of 1940
will be welcomed by Miss Thyrsa W.
Amos, dean of women. After the
distribution of the armbands the new
class will be introduced to senior
mentors who are to be their guides
on campus for the ﬁrst eight weeks
of the semester.

Each of the 39 mentors will meet
the six or seven freshmen who will
be in her group for eight weeks.

groups’ will gather -on the lawn of

- the Hotel Schenley for the traditional

Freshman High Tea, sponsored by the

Students To Open
Book Exchange
, Monday

The SFA Student Book Exchange
will open officially next Monday
morning at 10:30 o’clock in the
library checkroom on the ﬁfth ﬂoor
of the Cathedral, according to Chal-
mers Brown, C37, chairman of the
committee.

Books “wanted” or “for sale”
may be catalogued there from 10 :30
until 2:30 o’clock every day until
Monday, September 28.

The committee in charge wishes
to emphasize the fact that all books
will be catalogued alphabetically by
author; that it is imperative, there-
fore, for all students to know the
author’s name before attempting to
locate any book in the ﬁle. Students
are also requested to remove cards
from the ﬁle as soon after making
the transaction as possible. This will
eliminate unnecessary overloading
of the drawers and will particularly
relieve students from the bother of
answering or making useless phone
calls.

Committee members are Mary
Jane Beachler, Francis Devlin, Ar-
thur Kelley, Harriet Lewis, Ray-
mond McIntyre, Charles McLain,
Marion Messer, and Eleanor Sand-
berg. Mr. J. Howard Dice, Univer-
sity Librarian, is the faculty repre-
sentative on the committee.

To 'Em

HILOSOPHY, FORMALITY, stiﬁ collars, Pitt spirit are

I typical subjects for the editorial columns of most ﬁrst issues.

More important things like sweat, cramped ﬁngers from hold-

ring registration pens, coal dust mixed with the sweat, sore lips both
from checkin_g your curses and widening your smile ﬁnd more real-
istic places to hide during this hectic period. They are saved for the

more normal moments.

But let’s get normal. That is the toughest job for most Pitt men
and women. Fir.st, you must not let your Dean’s slap on the back
or hunt down the third base line at Kon-o-Kwee mean more than the

word which they connote in Mr.

Gerber’s or Mr. Peterson’s Eng-

lish class. If concrete experiences such as these mean interesting de-
tails for your weekly or bi-weekly freshman paper, then they are
worthwhile. However, if you lift the connection and toss it in the
Connoquenessing Creek, then you have lost one of the most import-
ant things .a University can offer. The entire orientation-registration
program is important and deﬁnitely connected with the four years

ahead.

Enjoy the sweat of freshman week——that is perhaps more im-
portant than the huge batches of wisdom that are heavy enough to
bury the ordinary freshman ﬁfteen feet under the ground. The
cramped ﬁngers will do you no harm. Your muscles will be much
tougher for that periodic math hazard. There is one short, direct
path in this direction that will make the cobbles inﬁnitely smaller,
the downstream current much slower, and the passes wider. And
in the words you soon will hear in the stadium on October Satur-

day’s “Sock it to ’em.”

Chancellor Emphasizes Work

Necessary Adjunct To Success

“Education keeps people from liv-
ing in a common rut,” Chancellor
John G. Bowman told more than
1,000 freshmen of the University of
Pittsburgh at Memorial Hall this
morning, as the University’s 150th
year started. The freshmen assem-
bly, at 10 o’clock, followed two days
of registration activities for the ﬁrst-
year students.

“To keep from living in a rut,” Dr.
Bowman continued, “is a good ideal
for the college student, but this does
not just happen to you because you
go to college. Really nothing just
happens. College is merely a chance
to learn how to live out of a rut, and
if you succeed it will be because you
worked at it.

Warning the freshmen that hard
work is necessary to pass courses, Dr.
Bowman said: “the intensive work
which lifts you to a way of living
above ruts is still more difficult.”

Dr. Bowman then told of being
asked by the father of one of the
freshmen whether religion was taught
at the University. He said that reli-
gion is taught “all over the campus.”

“In mathematics we teach it by dis-
covering the utter perfection in that
science. We teach it by the human-
ity in history; by precision and accu-
racy in the engineering shop; by
breadth of mind in literature; by won-
der and reverence toward the mean-
ing of life in biology; by fair play in

Everything For the Student

Although Pitt’s summer athletics
were not limited to the Olympics,
three of Coach Olson's Panthers—
Johnny Woodruﬂ’, Dick Mason, and
Charley Gongloff held l-ocal sports
fans interest through the ﬁnal try-
outs at Randalls Island Stadium on
Long Island.

Woodruﬁ’ remained in the spotlight
long enough'to scamper home with
an Olympic wreath. Mason and
Gongloff reached the ﬁnals at Long
Island.

Another event bringing honor to
the Panther trackmen was ﬁrst place
in the Al-l-Nations Independence Day
Festival meet at Schenley Oval. With
Dick Mason taking the 100 and 220-
yar-d dashes, Harold Tost Winning
both the mile and the 880 open
events, Bob Cogswell leading the
ﬁeld in the 880-yard affair, a.nd Andy
Lasky stepping out ahead in the 440-
yard race, the Olsonmen netted their
heavy score almost in its entirety on
the cinder path.

Not having a complete team on
hand for the ﬁeld events, the Pan-
ther trackers fared badly. Lasky,
by taking third in the 12-pound shot
put, tallied the only points garnered
in these events.

It matters little to the University
Riﬂe team whether they are besting
their opponents with riﬂes or books
for the musketmen scored a bull’s-eye
in the chase for academic honors
among the various Panther varsity
teams for the semester ending in
June. The golf team drove into sec-
ond place, the swimmers churned
their way to third place, and the
boxers rang the fourth place bell.

Most interesting was the fact that
the group quality point average rose
from 1.22 the ﬁrst semester to hit
the 1.42 mark.

Nick Kliskey, football captain,
led the list of individuals by ﬁnish-
ing the semester with a straight “A”
average. On his heels were Roy
Heckler of the tennis team, Sam
Musico, golfer, and Russell Lindberg,
swim captain. Art Detzel, football
tackler, and S01 Menaker and Mike
Sowiski, track men, raced neck-and-
neck for ﬁfth place, each with 2.50.

Sowisiki repeats on the list for the
sixth time. It was the fourth time
for Alex Le-ggin and Lindberg while
Leon Wno-hlgemuth and Johnny W-ood,
football players, show that three times
may be a. charm.

It’s Only September, And Already
A Review—Summer Sports Slants

Appearing on the list for the first
time were Bob Mease of the golf
team, Rags Radvansky of the basket-

ball sq-uad, Irvin Solow of the tennis
team, Detzel, Musico, and Heckler.

Even the faculty turned to sports
during the summer what with ﬂying
divots and cutting grass in the an-
nual Faculty club golf tourney.-
When the last ball plunked into the
cup at North Park July 24, Dr. Gel)-
hard Stegeman had swung some
wicked clubs. A score of 85 for the
18 holes permitted Dr. Stegeman to
slip three new balls into his bag.

Lowest net score, found by sub-
tracting the handicap from the gross
score put three new balls in the
hands of Georg-e I. Carson, who
could show a score of 75, with the
aid of a handicap of 23.

Irish Trouble

N otre Dam-e returns to Pittsburgh
‘the following Saturday, October 24,
and the Panthers will be out to
avenge last year’s heart-breaking
loss. The Irish jinx has been non-
partisan in its effectiveness against
Pitt athletic teams, and only a foot-
ball victory can get things running
Pitt’s way .again.

After .a visit to New York, where
Fordham will be met on October 31,
the Panthers come back to meet
Penn State on November 7. The
Lions are stronger this year, and
their conﬁdence was strengthened no
end by the close battle of last year,
which the Panthers won by a 9-0
count.

The Nebraska Cornhuskers Will be
met at Lincoln, and the season will
close on Thanksgiving with the an-
nual tussle with the Tartans. Plenty
of sophomores from an undefeated
plebe team that beat the Pitt frosh
team last season are expected to aid
Tech considerably. Former Coach
Wally Steffen is again returning, and
things are deﬁnitely on the upturn
across the hollow.

Things are shaping up quite well on
this side of Forbes Street also. No
more will Coach Sutherland be
plagued by greenness in his varsity.
Nineteen juniors, ten of whom earned
letters last year, will be ﬁghting for
varsity positions on this year’s
team. There are ﬁve senior regulars
out to do big things this fall in their
last chance at collegiate footba.ll-
Biff Glassford, Ave Daniell, Bobby
LaRue, Leo Malarkey, and Arnold
Greene.

Goldberg Sets Pace

Leading several promising new-
comers from last year’s freshman
outﬁt is Marshall Goldberg, whose
particular case of spring fever
showed astounding complications of
rushing through the varsity line and
secondary during the April drills,
and who has continued his antics in
practice to date.

This year there appears to be an
end to the end drought. Paul
“Bomber” Shaw should again prove
perfectly capable of handling the left
end job. Walt Miller, junior, Red
Fleming, sophomore, and Bernie Mc-
Nish are the others ﬁghting for the
left end position. McNish moved up
to the second team recently and is
now in a position to challenge the
Bomber. Over on the other side of
the line Frank Souchak holds the
reins. Competition here comes from
two of last year’s frosh stars, Bill
Daddio and Fabian Hoffman.

What was ﬁgured to be an unbeat-
able and certain tackle combination
made up of Tony Matisi, a bruising
junior, and George Delich was brok-
en up the last practice session when
Jim Scarfpin joined the ﬁrst string-
ers in Delich’s place. I-n addition to’
these three there are Ave Daniell,
210-pound senior; Elmer Mercovsky,
Brilliant la-st year as a freshman; Ben
Asavitch, another sophomore; and
Ted Schmidt and Jim Scarfpin, subs
that fall.

road, a 1-oly—‘p'o1;v scum‘-, is at ﬁxtui-e4
at one position, while Dante Dalley
Tezze will have to hustle to keep hisl
job avm-_v from Walter Raskotvski,
former New Castle liigh star, and
star on the plebe team last year. Al
Lezouski, another .sophomo1-e, leads
a pack of capable second-call men
including Luke Richards, George
Yocos, Al Walton and Steve Petro.

The center position is bound to
bother Dr. Sutherland, but Don Hens-
ley, second-stringe1* last year, seems
to have the inside track. Henry Ad-
ams and Bola Danni-es "are other pros-
pects. ,

Johnny Michelosen and Arnold
G1'eéne will ﬁght it out for the start-
ing position in the .qua1-terback slot.
Both , men are experien__ced, but
should be ru.she.d by Bob M‘cClure-, a
senior, and John Chickerneo, a soph-
omore.

Wood Boots ’Em

Goldberg, Leo Malarkey, and John-
ny Urban are (scrapping for the left
halfback job, while Bobby LaRu'e,_
ace for two years, seems to be headed‘
for the right halfback job. Curly
Stebbins, who .sp‘ai'ked last year’s
freshman backﬁeld along with Gold-
berg, may show enough stuff to dis-
place. the veteran LaRue. John
Wood, the best punter on the squad,
seems determined to dodge his jinx,
and to beat out both LaRue ah-d
Stebbins.

Frank Patrick, who starred last
year as a sophomore, should be in
there regularly aat the fullback post.
Bill Stapulis, a former halfback, may
press Patrick, as may John Dougert,
1935 replacement.

In the first practice game of the
fall drills last ‘Saturday the Panther
varsity scrambled the scrubs, 7-0,
which is not much of _a scrambling.
It was Marshall Goldberg, playing
left half for theﬁrst team, wl_io_ did
all the scoring of the day. Goldberg
trotted 35 yards in the second quarter
to score and Frank Souchak came
back from his end post long enough
to make the extra point.

Both teams were fairly evenly
matched. The second téam’s lone
scoring chance cam-e in the ﬁnal
quarter when Johnny Wood ran 60
yards only to have Bob LaRue cut
him down near the goal line.

 

Freshmen To‘ Attend
Conference On Health

Tomorrow freshman men and
women will meet in separate confer-
ences on Student Health.

Dr. H. C. Carlson, director of
student health service, and Dr. W. T.
Root, dean of the graduate school
and head of the department of psy-
chology, will address the men in the
main auditorium of Memorial Hall
from 9:30 to 11:00 o'clock. Dr.
Carlson will speak on physical hy-
giene as related to students while
Dr. Root will discuss mental health.

At the same time in Heinz House
freshman women will get pointers on
physical and mental health from Dr.
Auleene Marley Jamison, director of
women’s student health director; Dr.
Florence M. Teagarden, professor of
psychology; and Miss Elizabeth Rear-
ick, assistant professor of physical
education.

Dr. Jamison and Dr. Teagarden
will emphasize the student’s responsi-
bility to adjust herself to a new
health routine at college. They will
give a summary of outstanding faults

disclosed by the physical examina-

tions and suggest remedies. Miss
Rearick will speak on the facilities
offered by the physical education de-
partment and opportunities given

Freshmen Receive
Customs Buttons

 

Counsellors Distribute Pins
At First Meeting Today

 

Perhaps freshman men will be soon
wondering t.hey have
“branded” with a green and white
button. “Oh, me,” sighs one semi-
tragically. “I guess I’ll get lumbago
from tying shoelaces for upperclass-
men.”
panion sympathetically.

Quite to the contrary, these buttons
are worn so that upperclassmen can
recognize them and assist them at any
time on campus. Upperclass counsel-
lors, who have been assigned to orien-
tation groups, will distribute the but-
tons at the ﬁrst meeting and help
smooth out any difficulties that the
freshman encounters. In fact, they
are willing to do most anything but
homework

N. Robert Seidle, assistant to the
dean of men, wishes to -‘emphasize

tons are individuals who ‘want to be-
come part -of the University to the
fullest extent. They are the ones who

University, the schools and the Deans

ers, and the songs and cheers, ac-

onation in 1935; a member of Theta
Phi Alpha; a member of Cwens, soph-
omore women’s honorary activities
fraternity; a member of Mortar
Board, senior women’s honorary ac-
tivities fraternity; president of the
senior class; style editor of the Pitt
Panther for two years; honoram
colonel of the ROTC; a member of the

In expressing her regret over the
departure of Miss Anderson, Miss
Thyrsa W. Amos, dean of women,
said, “We are sorry, indeed, to lose
Miss Anderson. We have all been so
fond of her that it seems strange to
open the year without her. I’m sure
all of her University friends — stu-
dents, faculty, and certainly the of-
ﬁce of the dean of women—wish her
the greatest of luck. We hope, how-
ever, that she will not become so much
of a New Yorker that Pittsburgh be-

comes the far west to her.”

In speaking of Miss McLaughlin’s
appointment, Miss Amos stated, “I am
very happy to have as a member of
our staff one of whom we were all
proud as an undergraduate. She is
already ﬁtting herself beautifully into
her new work.”
