No Mascot 

Jerry Ends Career of
Six ' Years on
Campus

DIED: JERRY, mascot of‘ Heinz
House, friend .to every woman stu-
dent on the University of Pitts-
burgh campus, on Friday, Septem-
ber 18, 3:30 p. m. ..

Heinz House has quite a gala ap-
pearance in its new cost of paint,
but those who knew it last year,
and the year before that, and for
six years back cannot help feeling.
just a little bit strange that Jerry
doesn’t stop by on his tour of in-
spection for a cracker or a piece
of candy. ,

He was born in the month of
August, governed by -the dog~star,
Sirius, nine years ago, and’ came
to the‘Unlversi—ty-three years later.
Jerry has been Mrs. Fosters com-
panion "through her hours of work
and hours of rest; he's been the
pet of the University for many
years now, and even though Mrs.
Foster is considering getting a new
dog, it will be a little. hard; getting
used to the i_dea-that Jerry is dead.

Widening the Circle of Interest
teas in honor of all freshman and
transfer students will present to
them topics of national scholastic
interest." The tea will be held um:
hour on Wednesday, September 30,
in Heinz House. The large room
where all the social affairs at

Heinz’ House are held will be dec-
orated with pennants of many col-
leges.

The center of interest at this
National tea will be a talk on the
interesting phases of American
student life. The music which will
form the background will also be
purely American. The committee
in charge has planned a piano pro-
gram consisting of American negro
splrituals and Indian music.

The’ International tea will be the
last of the series, and will mark
the last circle of interest. Various
countries will be represented by
foreign students on campus who
will discuss the customs of their
countries in order to bring their
countrylands closer in the minds
of those present. This affair will
take place on October 8.

The ﬁrst tea on September 33
which introduced the freshman and
transfer students to the campus
and its customs was a successful
beginning for the group of teas.
The hall of Heinz House was dec-
orated to represent a golf course.
As each girl came in the door she
was given a golf ball with three
numbers on it. She then went to
the tee to which she was directed.
There she became one of a group
who were talking about the cam-
pus and its aﬁairs. ‘ ~

charge pf three teas. Her commit-
tee is composed of Regina De Si"‘-9%

 The Sehenley

“The beauty of Am"erican
Schools," stated Miss Augusta
Schutz-Harkanyi, Hungarian ex-
change student, when asked what
impressed her the most since her
arrival. Miss ~Schutz-Harkanyi ar-
rived at the University from Buds-
pest, Hungary, last Friday. The
large well-lighted class rooms and
the swimming pools and gymna-
sium were things Miss Schutz-Han
kanyi. had not dreamed of in a
public school.

Miss Schutz-‘Harkanyi received
her teacher's diploma at ﬁle Uni-
versity of Budapest, and taught in
a public school there for two years.
She is taking graduate work here

' . . T :, Q1‘. ’

The fact that American students
have so much time -to play is an-
other thing that greatly impressed
Miss Schutz-Harkanyi. She stated
thaizin Hungary the children: at-
tend school from 8 o'clock until 1.
Then they devote their afternoons
to studying German, French and
English which every cultured child
must learn. The children also
spend atgreat deal of time learning
to -play some instrument as this
type of music is not taught in the
schools. A

Miss ‘Schutz-Harkanyi will spend
a year at the University after
which she intends to visit a number
of schools throughout the country
before going home and applying
the American methods she has
learned.

  Eightlsanioies  

from Other Schools )

Following the custom’ inaugurat-
ed by Miss Thyrsa W. Amos, dean
of women, last year, in appointing

- senior mentors for women students

transferring ;f1 om other schools,
eight senior -mentors have been
chosen to aid transfer students at
Pitt this year.

These women, chosen from the
senior class include, Jane Barr,
Ed., -Mary Jane Brankstone, Col.,
Claire Cryder, Ed., '.Ann Kovach,
Ed., Marian McCartney, Ed., _Elza
Pa-pp, Col., Gene Schwartz, Ed.,
and Jane Wille, Ed. Manyof them
have been transfer students who
successfully adjusted themselves to
Pitt, and are in this way better
able to aid the new women in
adapting themselves to the life at
a new school.

The number of women transfer
sdudents ‘registered at the univer-
sity this year is seventy-trwo. One
of this number is an advanced
freshman, twenty-eight are includ-
ed in the sophomore class, twenty-
two in the junior class; and twenty-
one are seniors.

These women will meet with
the mentors for the first time, Fri-
day during drill hour, at an as-
sembly, after which they will di-
vide’ into their respective mentor
groups. . The -groups will continue
to meet each «week -for'~six weeks
where the mentors will discuss
with the, women the diiferent tra-
ditions and customs of the univer-

sity, and help them’ in solving the

problems arising from the first
weeks of adgustment at Pitt.

Y.1W.H.A. To Give Plays
Under New Direction

The Cooperative Playhouse, for-
merly the Y. M. H. A. Playhouse,
has announced the new policies of
organization, function, and admis-
sion rates for the coming year.

Last’ year the Playhouse pro-
duced Ned McCobb’s Daughter,
The Adding Machine, Credentials,
Around the World in Eighty Days,
and Ghosts under the direction of
Helen and Frank Stout.

The new Playhouse organization
is to be managed by a Green Room
Group. This division is composed
of all workers taking active part
in production. The Green Room
will decide the policy, guide pro-
duction, and act as a check for all
committees; will select a dirgector
and, with theconsent of that direc-
tor, a play. Six suggested com-
mittees, the chairmen of which
will be selected by the Green Room
Group, are: publicity, house,
ushers, social, program, and play-
reading,

Instead of subscriptions this
year, the Playhouse has introduced
memberships. These memberships
for a minimum of four plays are
$5.00, $2.00, and $1.00. The ﬁve-
dollar memberships will afford
choice reserved seats, two-dollar
memberships for plain reserved
seats, and one-dollar memberships
for" general admission.

I Scout Says:

Back To Nature

   

WELL, FOLKS, HERE we are
again! But we won't do the same
tricks that we performed last year
when we used the first few inches
of the column for introductory
notes in which we said nothing
which Professor lMaulsby might
use to guide those sorrowful look-
ing sophomores who meet with
him on Mondays, VVednesdays and
Fridays during the'sixth hour sup-
posedly to learn what and what

efforts.

This year, a new policy will be
followed, i. e-., the introductory
notes will be typed, ranked from
thrown in the
wastebasket, and then we will be-
gin again without them. Thus far,
we have succeeded in the same’
manner as -do those parasites who
make New Years’ resolutions. On
with- the tale!

[FOOTBALL COACHES, WHO
have been enjoying themselves
during the summer months, will
become their characteristic gloomy
selves tomorrow with the football
season scheduled to get under way.

For the past few years, it has

every coach of a major college
team in the country to predict dour
results for their teams, because
even though they may have ﬁfteen
to twenty of their twenty-two let-
termen of the previous season back
in school, all of their opponents
have their best teams in the his-
tories of their schools and all will

they score but one victory, that
over the team which the former
coaches ldirect.

“Gloomy Gil” -Dobie, aged Cor-
nell coach, is popularly pictured as
the creator of the pessimistic view-
point adopted by the ‘present day
coaches. Dobie was at his best

team whose lineup bore the name
of from three to four players of
all-American caliber “Gil” always
predicted defeat for his boys on
-the eve of every game.

 

DURING THE PAST few years,
however, “Gloomy” has not drawn
the publicity as was his former
wont, mainly because several of the
younger coaches as Rockne, Suth-
erland and Andy Smith, who were
producing great teams, teams with
better records than those which
Dobie’s teams were making at Cor-
nell, made better reading material
for sport rfandom than did “Gloomy
Gil.”

These coaches and their pupils,
who later became coaches them-
selves, followed “the .pre-game
pessimism” system to such a. de-
gree that it has become the cus-

game stories a week in advance.
Last year, the Pitt publicity de-
partment sent stories to all the
leading newspapers in the country
during the week before the Pitt-
Notre Dame football game to the
effect that Ma.cMurdo, Quatse,
Hirshberg, ‘Williams, IH-ood, Dailey,
and Collins would be unable to
play due to injuries suffered in pre-
vious games. When the two teams
lined up for the kick-off, ﬁve of
these men were in the starting
lineup, while the other two saw

 

WE WENT TO the coach's room
in the stadium this week for the
purpose of ﬁnding out what Suther-
land thought about his team's
chances of ﬁnishing the season
with a’ fair record. As a matter of
fact. we knew just what Jock would
say before we made the .trip from
the Activities building, but we went
anyhow just to make the thing au-
thentic.

It is needless for/ us to repeat,
what Jock said, for what has been
written above explains everything
-fully. Sutherlan-d's task is not an
easy one. The downtown papers
have been predicting a champion-
shim team for the Panthers ever
since Labor Day; and if Jock fails
to live up to their expectations, the
abuse which will be heaped upon
him by the grandstand coaches
will be even greater than it has
been in the past when Pitt teams
did not come up to expectations.

 

PITT’S SCHEDULE IS not an
easy one. Miami should furnish
the Panthers with little opposition;
but Iowa, which is met a week
later has fourteen lettermen re-
turning from last year's team, and
it will also have the advantage of
playing on its own ﬁeld.

West Virginia will be trouble-
some to the Panthers for more rea-
sons than those which fans con-
sider. There is only one game a
season for Greasy Neale’s boys as
far as football is concerned and that
is with Pitt. (Paragraph 4.) And
don't think that Captain Doyle,

Sortet, and Dawson relished those,
“stalling” basketball games with;
Doc Carlson's teams. These three‘
boys are mainstays on the football?
team as well as on the court teazn.l

Western Reserve and Penn State}
should be beaten, but the other}
remaining games on the schedule!

are real *“honeys," if you'll permiti _

the use of slang. Notre Dame has
a line full of lettermen back to-
gether with Marchmount -Schwartz
in the backﬁeld. Carnegie Tech
will put up its usual strong game.
Army which meets a bunch of set
ups earlier in the season will be in
better condition at the time of their
game with Pitt than will their op-
ponents.

As for Nebraska, they have al-
ways proved troublesome to the
Panthers, usually outweighing the
local team from ten to twenty
pounds per man. What was lack-
ing in their system in the past was
the use of strategy; and now that
Dan X. Bible has had sufficient
time to install his system at the
Western school, they should prove
a harder nut to crack than they
have been in the past.

 

‘LAST YEAR, WE made the mis-\
take of picking Pitt to win every
game on its schedule. The team
looked good at the start of the sea-
son. and we think that it should
have made a better record than
that of winning six games and tie-
ing one out of nine.

Despite the fact that Jock Suth-
erland has a large array of veter-
an material at his command to-
gether with a bunch of promising
boys up from last year's freshman
team, we hesitate to mention un-
defeated records.

Pitt should win tomorrow. We
don't know much about Miami, but
they have been \ballyhooed to ap-
pear more formidable than Waynes-
«burg which helped the Panthers
open their season for the past two
years. We'll say that the score
Will be 41-7; and You can toss your

Frosh Coach
Pessimistic

Add Wyoming Seminary
To Cub Grid Card

 

 

According to “Skip” Gougler,
the outlook is not so bright for
Pitt’s freshman football team.
The men reporting this year are
not as big nor as fast as those of
last year’s team. From seventy-
ﬁve candidates, many of whom
were high school and prep school
stars, Gougler hopes to mold a
hard-ﬁghting, well organized team.

The Panther Cubs face a tough
schedule. This year, they meet
Wyoming Seminary, a newcomer,
in a game which will probably be
the toughest of the season. They
also play a night game with the
West Virginia freshmen at Fair-
mont, West Virginia, on Friday
evening, October 30.

The freshman schedule is as
follows: - ,

Oct. 3——Wyoming Seminary at
Kingston, Pa,

Oct. 10—-Wash-Jeffff at Washing-
ton, Pa.

Oct. 17——Carnegie Tech at Pitts-
burgh.

Oct. 24-—Penn State at State
College, Pa.

Oct. 30-—(Night) West Virginia
at Fairmont, W. Va.

Nov. 6——Kiski at Saltsburg, Pa.

year. Daniel Butler, Bus. A. '32,
and Robert Sage, Col. '33, were ap-
pointed managers of the track and
tennis teams respectively.

Alcorn, a Mount Lebanon resi-
dent, has been a member of the
tennis squad for two years, and
was a member of the freshman
squad three years ago. Last year
was the first year he was able to
win a variety letter. He has been
participating in numerous tourna-
ments the past summer, and has
mach a creditable showing in all
of them. Alcorn is a member of
Kappa Sigma, national social fra-
ternlty.

Monheim, a. member of the var-
sity track squad for two years,
who lives in Elizabeth, Pa., has
won the varsity. emblem for that

Gridmen Meet
Penn In 1932

Shift Carnegie Game To
November 19

Pitt and the University of Penn-
sylvania will renew football rela-
tions which had been dropped
since 1925, next year, according

to the announcement made this‘

week by W. Don Harrison, direc-
tor of athletics at Pitt.

The two schools will meet at
Franklin Field next fall on No-
vember 5, the date originally set
for the Pitt-Tech game at the
Stadium. To clear the way for the
Penn game, Tech consented to
shift its game with Pitt to Novem-
ber 19, the Saturday before
Thanksgiving.

The game was scheduled by
Harrison of Pitt and Dean Leroy
Mercer and Graduate Manager H.
J. Schwartz, of Penn, and was ap-
proved at the quarterly meeting
of the Pitt Atheltic council this
week.

One Year Contract

The contract calls for but a sin-
gle game at Philadelphia but a
return game will probably be held
in Pittsburgh in 1933.

negie Tech game to November 19,
the Saturday before Thanksgiving,
the opener has been shifted -to

letterman for the past two years, as a regular tackle on

Many writers in the past have
commented upon the home talent
which graced Doc Carlson's basket-
ball teams during the past four
years or ever since the time when
Doc Carlson and Pitt became by-
words in basketball circles through-
out the country.

Most of these basketball players
either lived in Pittsburgh or one
of its neighboring towns. Charley
Hyatt and Paul Zehfuss were Pitts-
burghers. Gyp Wunderlich came
from Duquesne as did the Kowallis
boys. Sykes Reed and the Wrob-
leski’s hail from Braddock. Paul
Fisher was a Bellevue product, as
is Don Smith. Bus Albright comes
from Uniontown which is also the

home of the Cohen brothers.
Willie Arture gets his mail in
Sharpsburg and Tim Lawry gets
his in Munhall. Eddie Baker was
the lone player who traveled any
distance from Pitt to his home,
and he was from Pennsylvania,
Nanticoke, to be exact.

Practically the same condition
will prevail this year with regards
to the Pitt football team. Although
the Pitt squad numbers ﬁfty men
of all shapes and sizes, no less
than 36 of these men come from
Pennsylvania and but four other
states have native sons represented
on what promises to be one of the
strongest teams in the country.
Pittsburgh Leads.

For the first time in many years,
Pittsburgh will have more of its
residents on the squad than any
other city. Pittsburgh will have
six men on the squad and although
none of them is expected to be a.
regular, two of them, Zola Alpert
and Bob Timmons are expected to
see a lot of action as quarterback
and end, respectively.

Sioux City, Iowa, has the second
highest number of men on the
squad with four. Rip Collins was
the ﬂrst boy from that town to
come to Pitt and he was followed

Football Squad Draws
’ Mostly From Home Talent

 

by Duke Siegle, Howard O’dell,
Mel Brown, Vincent and Satterlee.
The latter two have dropped out
of school, but the other four will
be in there battling for positions
with Collins practically sure of
starting the Miami game at end.
These boys are the lone Iowans on
the Pitt squad.

The rest of the squad hail from
various different cities, Wheeling,
West Virginia having three mem-
bers; but the rest of the boys hail-
ing from here, there and every-
where.

W. Va. Has Many.

Aside from Iowa with its four
representatives and West Virginia
with ﬁve, Weirton and Fairmont
each having one member, New Jer-
sey and Ohio boast of the other
Panthers living outside of Penn-
sylvania. New Jersey’s representa-
tives are Ted Dailey, a letterman
as an end last year who lives in
Phillipsburg, and Dan Bertman, _
who is trying for a tackle berth oni
the Pitt team for the ﬂrst time.

Ohio’s Panther gridders are the

Morris boys, Hart and Bob, who
live in Bellaire, and Harold Roth,
a halfback candidate from Denni-
son. .
Maybe, Doc Carlson will get
jealous of the home talent Jock
Sutherland will send out on the
ﬁeld this year; butif the football
home talent is anywhere near as
successful as the basketball home
talent has been in the past, Pitt
should have a whale of a team this
fall.

what is expected to be a typical 11d-lifter, a Pitt victory.

Wilbur Cartwright and Warren Ott combination, may cause

Six Veterans Grace
Cross-Country Squad

Perhaps that perennial smile
which ﬂits across the face of
Frank Shea these balmy fall days
is just his outward reﬁection of
happiness, but somehow the prom-
ising work of this year's cross-
country candidates seems to clari-
fy his present outlook.

Cross;-country, during the past
few years, has been on the verge
of oblivion, rising abit from its
lethargic state at times only to
fall back again. The former Pitt
track star, Coach Shea, however,
seems to have things back on the
upgrade, with good prospects of
bettering last year's dismal rec-
ord.

Six Lettcrmen Return

Captain Thiele, Smoyer, Clise,
Tapp, and Santicola of last year’s
lettermen have returned and will
be strengthened by the presence
of Schmieler, former letterman;
Monheim, captain-elect of the
track team, Lawrence, McCormick,
and a. host of other aspiring har-
riers.

The Gold and Blue harriers face
a strenuous schedule, which in-
cludes meets with Allegheny, Syra-
cuse, West Virginia, Penn State,
Carnegie Tech, and Army. Of these
Alleghney, Syracuse, , Carnegie
Tech and Army will be met on
home soil. Cracking the brilliant
array of harriers annually pro-
duced at -Syracuse, Penn State,
and Army is hardly to be expected,
but the Panthers will be a set-up
for none.

Miami, with 11 veterans and some.

promising sophomores on its
squad, will be the -ﬁrst team using
the Zuppke system that the Panth-
ers have encountered, and this fact
must be taken into consideration

bef-ore the Panthers can expect to
win.
Veteran-s to Start.

Pitt will likely start Hirshberg
and Collins at the ends, MacMurdo
and Quatse or Meredith at the
tackles, Hart Morris and Milligan
at guard, Daugherty at center, and
a backﬁeld composed of Reider.
lH'eller, -Clark and Hogan. There is
also a. possibility that Cutri or Al-
pert will call signals, and Luch
may crash the starting lineup.

Against this array of talent,
Miami will more than likely place
Ott and Corry at the ends, Kero-
kes and Vaccariello at tackle, Horn
and Evers at guard, «and Csepke at
center. LMil1er, Cartwright, Smith
and Stryker are Miami’s best bets
for the backﬁeld.

Cartwright, Miami’s All-Ohio
half back, is expected to cause
what trouble is caused by his
team. Miami’s passing attack will_
likely be relied upon to gain
ground, as the experienced Pitt
line will be hard to crack for -any
team.

Cross country manager, Daniel

assisted by Professor Edwin H.
Reeder, of Columbia University,
has written a new geography for

According to Miss Thralls, the

The program for the banquet in-
cludes speeches by three notable
speakers: Dr. Francis W. Shep-
erdson, national president of Beta
Theta Pi and for many years editor
of Baird’s Manual, will speak on
“Fraternalism;” Arthur R. Priest,
national executive secretary of Phi
Delta Theta, will speak about "A
Brother's Duty to his Fraternity;”
and Cecil J. Wilkinson, National
executive secretary of Phi Gamma
Delta will speak on “Whatis the

' Business of ag Fraternity.”

There are enough funds in the
treasury of the Interfraternity
Council so that is possible to sell
tickets for the banquet for one
dollar and two dollars for the
dance. Each fraternity will be re-
sponsible for the sale of ten tickets
to each of these events. The com-
mittee in charge of the conference
is headed by W. Eugene Pry, Phi

.Coach To Pick Cheer
, Leaders Saturday

Varsity cheerleaders will be se-
lected from a squad of twenty-ﬁve
candidates by «a committee of three
headed by William Brinker, 1927
head cheerleader and new coach of
the yell squad, aﬁter the Pitt-
Miami football game, Saturday.
The leaders have been working out
with Coach {Brinker each afternoon
at the §tadium.

Of lhst year's varsity men ﬁve
out of the seven leaders are bold-
overs but are by no means certain
of retaining their jobs. The ﬁve
are John Williams, ‘Bus. Ad. '32;
Robert .'I‘homas, ‘Bus. Ad, ’32;
James Somerville, Bus. Ad. ’32;
Paul Miller, Eng. ’33; Linwood
Thiessen, Eng. ’33.

Williams worked at basketball
games last winten and more recent-
ly got spirited responses from the
freshmen at their banquet last
Wednesday.

It is almost certain that the
cheerleaders will be part of the
entourage when the football team
goes to Penn .State on October 31.

. Decrease 15 Percent

A decrease of $14,368 under the
amount earned last year by Uni-
versity coeds was disclosed in a re-
port recently issued by the‘Dean of
Women. More than 474 women,
employed in part-time work earned
a. total of $76,872 drom September,
1930, to May, 1931.

The dean’s report indicated that
75 percent of the coeds enrolled at
the University participated in extra-
curricular Iactlvities. Sevenhun-
dred and twenty-seven women took
partvin activities, with 538 of this
number holding offices of sufficient
importance to merit activities

ber. No deﬁnite starting date has
been set. A ring has been erected
in the track house, and practice
will be held there until it is pos-
sible to use the Stadium.

Matches with Penn State, Tem-
ple, Army, West Virginia, and Car-
negie Tech have been arranged by
the Athletic Department. “There
are no set-ups on our schedule this
Year," said Orsini, “and we’ll
need the best men in Pitt to have
a winning team."

A call for all students to report
for the initial practice will be is-
sued at a later date. As there is
a possibility of an interfraternity
boxing meet being held this year,
all fraternity men are especially
urged to report. ~

Riflers Hold Initial
Y Workout Monday

Practice tor candidates for the
varsity riﬂe team will get under
way Monday afternoon at the riﬂe
range ‘in the Stadium with Lieu-
tenant Wilson of the University
R. O. T. C. department in charge.

-Practice sessions will be held
daily from 2:00 o’clock to 5:00
o’clock throughout the season.

Coach Wilson expects this year’s
team to surpass the record of last
year’s squad which ﬁnished eighth
in national standing after a. poor
start due~to lack cs” facilities; but
with the new range available at
the start of the season, Lieutenant
Wilson predicts a higher rating
for the Panthers despite the fact
that the team will be without the

services of Robert Hempel, lead-

ing scorer for the past two years.

The schedule has not as yet
been completed but will will proba-
bly be released within a few days.

Fraternities To Join

In Coal-Buying Plan

Pitt fraternities will buy‘7t‘heir win-
ter’s coal on la. cooperative plan if
negotiations now being conducted
by Theodore W. Biddle, a.ss~ista.nt to

' the dean of men, are deﬁnitely con-

cluded. - .

By buying coal on‘ -a cooperative
basis, fraternities may obtain stand-
ard chips coal at $3.60 and $3.65 a
This price represents a sav-
ing from $4.25 and $4.50, the regu-
lar retail price. 1 7
, Although no deﬁlnite action on
the proposal has yet been taken,
Frank -Goodfellow, president of In-
terf-raternlty ‘Council, will present
the matter for the approval of that
group at its ﬂrst meeting of the
year next week.

give him the opportunity to
get that entertainment from
regulated school affairs?

This is the popular view-
point. If it prevails, commit-
tees sponsoring the multitudi-

cise caution. -They must be
moderate in both their tastes
and their demands. A group
that would dare to boost an

opportunity to exercise a. na-
tural ﬂair for artistic writing.
In another column on this
page is published the latest
letter from an adherent to this
opinion. '

The number of students who
appreciate this style of writ-
ing in campus publications has
been shown to be limited. Yet
this does not entirely preclude
the right of this minority to
seek a medium for expression
of their talents.

Those persons favoring ar-
tistic writing seem always first
to turn to _, the Pitt Weekly.
The policy of the paper has
been to meet their requests in
some measure, but we recog-
nize the inadequateness of this
arrangement. The Pitt Week-
ly must perform its essential
duty as a campus newspaper,
publishing ﬁrst only that news
which has the greatest appeal
to the greatest number of stu-
dents. ’

Two years ago, supporters
of the more intellectual type
of wri_ting-had “Steps,” a pub-
lication "devoted exclusively to
-the artistic style. The periodi-
cal was discontinued because
of lack of ﬁnancial support.

Since, therefore, it has been
demonstrated that it is impos-
sible for the Weekly to meet
their requests and since there
is no room for a new publica-
tion, we suggest that support-
ers of the artistic movement
approach ‘Mr. Howard and Mr.
Weslager, editors of the Pitt.
Panther. I Maybe these two
could be persuaded to forego
for one issue their customary '
parade of Pitt personalities
and puns, and incorporate in
their publication the more in-

-* tellectual sort of thing. Mr.
Weslager, in informal conver-
sations, has already signiﬁed
his willingness to consider I

such a suggestion. -

K Protection for Coeds

RESHMEN WOMEN are to
be carefully inducted into
University life. There will be
no danger of the 'ﬂr”st year
woman becoming lost in a
maze of activities all the. time
she is ﬁghting her way through
a. new set of studies. '
In accordance with a ruling
passed by the oiiice of the
Dean of Women, no freshman
girl can become a full-ﬂedged
member of an activity during
the first semester, at least.
The idea has merit. Activities
should, of course, be controlled
and shared by the upper class
students who possess the ex-
perience .and a slightly more
,mature outlook on the college
system. It is not natural that
freshmen should be conspicu- ’
ous in the extra-curricular
work. , --
However, under such a sys-
tem it becomes necessary for
the women's organizations to
develop a method of systematic
training of freshmen, In an-
other year, present freshmen
will have to step into activi- .
ties. They will have to get the
background by some means.
There is little doubt that the
upper class women will not
overlook this plan. ‘

One of Johnny Luch’s hobbies is walking. After
strenuous practices he likes to amble about the
ﬁelds. At training camp, one Sunday morning
Johnny asked “Buzz” Brown, hog-calling
maestro, if he would like to take a little walk.
“Sure,” said “Buzz,” “a little walk is good for
the health!" ' .

It was afternoon before the boys returned to
Windber. ‘‘I don't know why he's tired," said
Johnny, “Gosh, we only walked ten miles!"

Police rush to the ticket booth and
in an instant -the dazed country

he finds ‘himself standing before the

They tell us that the Y play-
house is going to give us something
really new in the way of little
theaters this year. so far there
are only big white tickets (no man-
ager, no staff, no plays, no Gist!»
no plans) and some last year’: cos-
tumes and scenery, and the big
studio room! with the resounding
floor. But it seems that, if we buy
one of the white effects,’ we get a
right to do anything in the line of
drama-making in that studio. We
bring our tickets, we meet the other
ticket-holders, we sign ourselves
as costume-designers, stage-hands,
actors, musicians, or what you will;
and all of a sudden a play emerge!
with a_ cast, a stage crew, and-
eventually and by the most demo-
cratic public vote-—a -manager. We
might be almost anything from the
premiere dansuese to the manipu-
later of spot-lights. Or, if we are
interested and lazy, we may go up
to the studio at any reasonable
hour, and just watch.. Just watch!
We're guaranteed not to be kicked
" out, or grozen up, or even politely
endured. it's going to be a gay
business. We know, because last
year we chanced in for a minute
during the preparations for Cre-
dentials and saw the designers and

slung about, crimson and yellow

and blue and everything. So, if

we like experiments or have a re-
pressed fancy for nosing about, we

might inquire. . . .

“Or Candy and Books?

But maybe we’d rather stay
at home and eat candy’ and
read. If we want books, the
summer has given us a rich
list to choose from. Perhaps

sthe most worthy is Miss Cath-
er’s Shadows On the Rock,
grave, misted, perfect. She
caught her inspiration, they
say, from the Saint Genevieve
murals of Puvis de Chevanne.
Both the novel and the murals
are designed to ﬁnd favor in
the most discerning and the
maturest eyes, but their com-
mon simplicity must recom-
mend them to the less learned,
too. Everybody can appreci-
ate a perfect pearl or the gray
shadow of an ivy vine. But
if we want something with a
splendid blare, we'd better
turn to Naomi Mitchison’s
latest——The Corn King and the
spring Queen--in which we
see an ancient world that
stretches from Sparta across
Scythia and Egypt and glows .
with a grandeur that reminds
us of Marlowe and amazes us
in Miss Mitchison. We like
her old style better-the earth-
smelling simplicity and bare
design of When the Bough

Breaks and Black Sparta-. _

There is no simplicity here.

Seven hundred pages of every-

thing, -—- philosophy, history,

amounts, and religion. But the
plot is strong enough to -pull
you through even seven hun-
dred pages, and Miss Mitchi-
son at her best is--well, Miss
Mitchison at her best.
A Cultural History?

We also note: “that the second
volume of Egon Friodell’s Cultural
History of The Modern Age is
translated and for sale, Having
read and reread the first volume
we want the second enough to
charge it on this month’: bill. Mr.
Fl'ledB|I’Q’ history is vivid, exact,
and precise In spite of the fact that
it is built along metaphysical and
Spengler-Ian lines. its philosophy
is objective, at |ea8t_‘In its trap-
pings. There Is scarcelya chapter
that does not contain some vivid
biographical glimpse. And the
style is so easy, so smooth, so col-
orful that we wonder if the Ger-
mawtext could ‘rsaily“be any more
splendid. to be sure, It hssa too-
timely and too-fragile quality; bo-
side a Gibbon it has the effect of
a very fine dragon-fly near a stone.
But It leaves us what some people
choose to call the soul-of-an-age,
and ‘it sparkles with such detail
as most ‘historians are a bit too
grave to consider--Renaisgance
dinners,‘ medieval costumes, gab-
bages as important as kings.

Perhaps it's Music. 

As~.fo=rvthe- muse Calliope, we

feel tbatpshe has jilted us and

taken herself a long way on.

We hear. that there is to be a

performance -of Orpheus at

Leningrad, and a possible sec-

ond festival next year at Bay-

reuth. We also hear that the

Pittsburgh Orchestra is on the

brink of confusion, and that

the Morning Musical Radio
hour manages to get lost on
the way. And we wonder if Mo-

_ zart and Gluck will ever be
sung in Pittsburgh and console
ourselves with the thought
that, oh, well, maybe phono-
graph records are better after
‘all.

football flayers making the first
three touchdowns of the 1931 foot-

According to zliiram Howard,

the three free subscriptions are
part ’of the Panther-’s campaign‘ to
make the coming -football season a

DID YOU FORGET THE

To the Editor of the Weekly:
The system followed last
year at Pitt of having as-
sistants grade‘ themes and ex-
amination papers is hardly
fair to students. Is it too
‘ much to ask «-that the instruc-
tor or professor who gives the
quiz should grade it? ’

If a student has listened to
lectures from one man and fol-
lowed the work outlined by
him, it is probable that the
one who grades the papers
may not be able to understand
the things written by the stu-
dent. The instructor may have
made some special reference
to a matter in class. If the
students give this in an exami-

' nation, the reader, ‘if’ other
than the instructor, will per-
