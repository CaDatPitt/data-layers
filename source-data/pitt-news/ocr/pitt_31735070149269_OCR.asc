State may
restore Pitt

funding

Recent developments in Harrisburg
indicate that Pitt might retain its
current state funding levels for next
year.

While Gov. Tom Corbett pro-
posed a 30 percent cut in February
to three of the four state-related
universities — Lincoln received a
proposal for level funding — the
state House panel approved legis-
lation on Thursday that prevents

that cut. In May, the state Senate '

passed similar legislation to restore
funding to the state—supported and

_ state-owned universities. ~

However, Corbett’s office was not
ready to conﬁrm that Pitt would be
spared from the proposed funding
cuts.

“In February, the Governor
doesn’t have a crystal ball to de-
termine what the revenue will be
[in June]. With increasing revenue
the state was able to restore some
funding,” said Tim Eller, Pennsylva-
nia Department of Education press
secretary. “But the budget is not
ﬁnalized.”

Pitt’s Board of Trustees elected
three distinguished University
alumni to its membership during
a public meeting on June 22 at the
William Pitt Union.

During the meeting, Sam Zach-
arias, chairman of the Board’s
Nominating Committee, proposed
a resolution conﬁrming Dr. Jack
Smith, David Chavern and Brent
Saunders as new members of the
Board. Current members of the
Board unanimously approved the
resolution.

The Nominating. Committee’s
resolution comes after several
meetings earlier this year in which
the committee reviewed candidates
for the Board of Trustees. During a
public meeting held onjune 13, the
Nominating Committee endorsed
the recommendations of Smith,
Chavern and Saunders.

All three of the newly—elected
members of Pitt’s Board of Trustees
received undergraduate degrees
from Pitt and hold prominent po-
sitions in their ﬁeld of business.

Chavern, a 1983 Pitt graduate,
serves as Executive Vice Presi-
dent and Chief Operating Ofﬁcer

of the United States Chamber of
Commerce. He’s also a member of
President Barack Obama’s advisory
committee for trade policy and ne-
gotiations.

Smith, who received his M.D.
from Pitt’s School of Medicine, for-

. merly served as president of Pitt’s

Alumni Association.

Saunders, a 1992 Pitt graduate
and former Student Government
Board president, currently serves
as president of Bausch & Lomb, one
of the world’s largest producers of
eye and healthcare products.

The Board of Trustees also
re-elected the Board’s chairman,

Stephen Tritch. Zacharias com-
mended Tritch for his devotion
to Pitt. .

“Your dedication and commit-
ment to the University serves this
Board exceptionally well, and we
look forward to your continued
leadership,” Zacharias said.

In addition, the Board approved
the appointment of Eva Tansky
Blum and Marlee Myers as vice
Chairpersons for the 2012-2013
school year. Myers and Blum will

Michael Ringling
Assistant News Editor

Last Wednesday, the Department
of Justice criminally charge_d a
Loveland, Ohio, man suspected
of producing the Anonymous
YouTube threat against Pitt.
United States Attorney David
J. Hickton announced that Alex-
ander Waterland, 24, “has been
charged with making Internet
threats and violating the federal
Computer Fraud and Abuse Act
for posting on YouTube a video
and a comment, which threat-

ened the University of Pitts- ' asecurity breach.

faculty usernames and pass-
words, payment information
and coursework. The video still
remains on YouTube.

Anonymous, a global security
and privacy activist group, often
claims responsibility for cyber
attacks on credit card compa-
nies and has also been known to
target businesses and universi-
ties that it feels does not protect
data.

The video asked for an apol-
ogy from the University for its
“lack of care for [its] students
and their valuable, yet vulner-
able information.”

the author of
these threats.”

Furthermore, a comment
posted by AnonOperative13 on
the video said that Pitt had until
May 6, 2012, to post an apology
that needed to stay up for no less
than 15 days.

The news release from the De-
partment ofjustice said,"‘These
charges pertain to speciﬁc cyber-
threats in April and May of this
year that targeted the University
of Pittsburgh and caused disrup-
tion in campus operations.”

Pitt spokesman Robert Hill
said in an email that the Uni-

versity examined its system in _

April and found no evidence of

threats were
part of the se-
ries of threats
received * by
the University
since Febru-
ary. The inves-
tigation is com-
prehensive and
ongoing.”

Hickton clariﬁed in a state-
ment released Wednesday that
the threats Waterland has been
charged with are not related to
the string of bomb threats di-
rected at Pitt at the conclusion
of last semester.

Special Agents of the FBI’s
Pittsburgh and Cincinnati field
offices arrested Waterland on
Wednesday, June 20.

If found guilty of the afore-
mentioned charges, Waterland
could face a maximum penalty
of seven years in prison, a ﬁne
of $500,000 or both. i

BUDGET I

Eller added that no details of
the budget could be conﬁrmed
until negotiations are complete in
Harrisburg and a ﬁnished budget
is released.

1_ Pitt spokesman Robert Hill ac-
knowledged that the pull back on the
proposed cut is not yet set in stone.

“We are grateful that the General
Assembly restored Pitt’s appropria-
tion to last year’s level in the latest
budget proposal,” Hill said. “But
this is simply the next step in the
budgeting process. We are hopeful
that the current budget legislation
will eventually become law.”

Members ofboth the Democratic
and Republican parties recognized
the positive aspects of adjusting Cor-
bett’s proposed funding for higher
education.

“It’s clear there was bi—partisan
support for reversing this year’s cuts
for higher education,” said House

“|t’s clearthere
was bi—partisan
support for
reversing this
year’s cuts

to higher 
educaﬁonf’
Rep.Dan Frankel

Chairman Dan Frankel, D—Allegh-
eny, in a statement, which went on
to say that he was disappointed the
funding levels were not returned to
those of two years ago. _

Last year, the ﬁnal budget passed ‘
with only a 19 percent chop ‘to the
ﬁmding of Pitt, Penn State, Temple
and Lincoln. To help ﬁll the resulting
$40 million budget gap, Pitt raised

in-state tuition by 8.5 percent and
out-of—state tuition by 4 percent.

Republican Senate PresidentPro
temporejoe Scarnati also addressed
the importance of restoring funding
to the state-related universities.

“As a parent of a ‘college student,
I recognize that keeping our univer-
sities properly ﬁmded and limiting
tuition increases should be our goal
for every budget,” he said in a state-
ment. .

The House’s‘ legislative move
came ‘a day alter the governor joined
with members of the house and sen-
ate leadership to announce that they
had arrived at a $27.66 billion state
budget agreement.

Members of the general assem-
bly and the governor continue their

' negotiations this week with July 1

looming as the start to the new ﬁs-
cal year. If a budget is passed by the
June 30 deadline, this year’s budget
would mark the second the Corbett
administration has passed on time.

TRUSTEES  

Robert Hernandez who have served
on the Board since 2003 and 2006,
respectively.

Before presenting Broadhurst
with a plaque honoring her contri-
butions to the Board, Tritch lauded
Broadhurst and Hernandez’s work
as vice Chairpersons, a position he
said came with an ambiguous job
description.

“As I have said on numerous
occasions, our vice chairs really
make signiﬁcant contributions to
the Board’s effectiveness,” Tritch
said. “They do a lot of things be-
hind the scenes. They cover some
of the meetings that we’d like to
have extra coverage on, take on
special assignments.”

In the last two items of new
business, the Board approved a
resolution electing Hernandez
and fellow Board member Michael
Bryson to the University of Pitts-
burgh Trust’s Board of Trustees as
well as appointing Board member
Robert Paul as University Director
of UPMC’s Board of Directors.

Board Member John H. Pelusi

also reviewed capital projects ap-

proved by the Board of Trustees

over the last year. Speci-ﬁcally fo-
cusing on additions made to labo-
ratories on the third floor of the
Chevron Center, Pelusi said the
project cost approximately $2.63
million and generated 20 on- and
off-site construction jobs.

Before the meeting, Pitt Chan-
cellor Mark N ordenberg highlight-
ed the work of Pitt’s faculty, staff
and students, while placing special
emphasis on the work of the Pitt
police over the past year.

“Let me begin by saying that I
have the strongest feelings of re-
spect, affection and gratitude for
the University of Pittsburgh po-
lice,” Nordenberg said. “In fact,
that sounds a little formal; in past
occasions, I’ve said I loved the Uni- '
versity of Pittsburgh police and
meant it.” .

Following Nordenberg’s ac-
knolwedgement of the Pitt police,
Tritch presented a plaque to each
officer who was on location during
the March 8 shooting at Western
Psychiatric Institute and Clinic.
John Shick, 30, shot six people,
killing one, before a Pitt police of-
ﬁcer fatally shot him.

Nordenberg also dedicated a
large segment of his introduction

‘to honoring the accomplishments
of Pitt students and faculty, focus-

ing primarily on the University’s
accomplishments between the
years of 1995 and 2012. He said in
1995, the average combined math
and reading SAT score of incoming
freshman was 1100. This year, he
said, the average was 1280.

Nordenberg also noted the large
number of students and faculty
members who received academic
awards, including Cory Rodgers, a
2012 Pitt graduate who received the
prestigious Rhodes Scholarship.

Before closing his speech, Nor-
denberg honored the resilience and
unity of Pitt’s student body. Using
Pitt’s commencement ceremony
as an example of what he, called
the “Pitt community,” Norden-
berg said the string of more than
100 bomb threats and the West-
ern Psychshooting last semester
united people associated with the
University.

“This community came to-
gether in a literal sense at com-
mencement,” Nordenberg said.
“That ceremony always is special,
but this year’s stood out. The Pe-
tersen Events Center was packed
with people who would make the
decision that no one was going to
keep them from celebrating this
major milestone in the lives of our
graduates.” ﬂ '

We’re ﬁnally there: More than half
of young adults with smartphones
use them in the bathroom. Now
that we’re sharing toilet—time with
Siri, is this sure-ﬁre evidence that
society has descended into a de-
praved pit of self-deceiving loneli-
ness? That we have once and for
all ceded our precious humanity
to social media overlords?
Assuming people are sanitizing
their phones afterward, I think
not. Sure, the Various forms of
“electronic connectedness” con-
tinue to transform our lives, but
those who decry the changes as
a slippery slope toward a world
teeming with lifeless automatons
are simply wasting time whining.
They’d be better off swapping the
quixotic pontiﬁcating with toilet-
time (with or without cell phones).
A new survey conducted by

polling ﬁrm Harris Interactive
has revealed the obvious: As of
May 2012, Americans are more at-
tached to their smartphones than
everbefore. Fifty-eight percent of
smartphone users say they can-
not go an hour without checking
their phones, 87 percent become
panicked or desperate when
misplacing their phones and 30
percent admit to checking their
phones during meals with oth-
ers. And yes, 39 percent of total
respondents take smartphones
into the bathroom. That statistic
goes up to 51 percent for people
aged 18-34.

Barring the study’s method-
ological limitations (2,097 re-
spondents were hand-picked to
be representational, not quite as
good as a random sample from
the U.S. population), its implica-
tions are clear —— and potentially
jarring, at least for certain observ-

ers. That is, if you were to survey ”

editorial pages of American col-

lege newspapers for the past 10
years, you’d amass mountains of
articles warning readers about the
supposed ‘fsocial dangers” of the
proliferation of electronic con-
nectedness (we’re talking about
things that connect you: calls,
texts, emails, news feeds, Face-
book and Twitter, but generally
not TV or video games).

You know these arguments.
They would say that time spent on
Facebook threatens to diminish
the value of face-to-face interac-
tion or that relationships born
by texting are destined for sorry
conclusions or that diverting
time toward social media would
invariably depress your grades
and productivity. All of the argu-
ments would end with some des-
perate appeal to “unplug” and go
outside to hear birds chirping and

Technology should help, not hurt US history knowledge

Jonathan Fischer
For The Pitt News

If there were ever any doubtsthat
the upcoming generation of young
whippersnappers is ignorant of the
past, the recent death of Rodney
King might have decimated any
chance of rebutting that claim. Log-
ging onto Facebook and other social
media websites on June 17 proved
to be a disappointingly insightful
look into the minds of our digitally
equipped college peers and the
younger generation.

“Should I know who Rodney
King is? lol,” was a popular status I
read on Facebook that day.

I don’t expect every one of my
friends to know exactly who Rod-
ney King was, and I am not claiming
that the people who entered such
inquiries as their statuses were any,
less intelligent than you or me. I am
simply observing a foul—smelling
scent of ignorance in the air, free
to be inhaled (and perhaps exhaled)

by every member of our age group.
Ignorance is deﬁned as a “state
of being uninformed.” And could
we inhabit a state more ironic than
this, in a day when being informed
has become easier than ever? “We
have the technology,” as Oscar Gold-
man states in the 1974 movie “The
Six Million Dollar Man.” With the
advancement of the Internet and
instant access to encyclopedias,
Google and other means of re-
searching-at the click of a -button,
I ﬁnd it strange that the youth of
the nation isn’t showing any im-
provement in U.S. history scores.
According to the 2010 report of the

National Assessment of Educational ‘

Progress, 12th-grade U.S. history
scores have remained roughly the
same since 1994.

This is troubling to hear — with
the growth of the Internet and easy
access to historical information over
the past two decades, we should
have seen signiﬁcant improvement
in these grades.

According to data from the
World Bank, in 1994, 5 percent of
Americans were online and using
the Internet in their household, and
that statistic has grown to more than
75 percent today. There’s been a sim-
ilar positive trend in the amount
of data being accessed and created
on the Internet over the past two
decades, as well. A look at all of these
numbers yields the conclusion that
with all of this new technology avail-
able to facilitate casual research, we
should rapidly be decreasing the in-
formation generation gap between

us and our past. Surely, this genera-

tion has the unique opportunity to
utilize these advancements to “get
in touc ” with our history. Unfortu-
nately, time and time again, I con-
tinue to read cringe-worthy statuses
that continue to suggest otherwise.

“Wait, the titanic story. actually
happened?” was another Facebook
trend that I encountered around
the 100th anniversary of the tragic
event this past April.

Education today involves
Googling the answers to questions,
and I fear it’s negatively impacting
our ability to retain information.
Our education no longer involves
poring over dictionaries, but rath-
er instant access to spelling and
grarnmar-checking software. Yes,
the Titanic did, in fact, exist, and
yes, you should have learned about
it in history class. Because of the
advancements in technology and
a plethora of resources providing
instant access to facts and ﬁgures,

there abounds a sentiment that re- *

tention of such knowledge is no lon-
ger necessary. We have evolved into
an “instant information” society
and has lost some of our respect for
our previous generation’s time and
efforts to collect this knowledge.
We are becoming ignorant because
our new technological abilities and
advancements allow us to be.

But our history demands respect
if we are to improve our education
and remain capable of usefully ap-

plyingwhat we’ve learned. Our edu-
cational system needs to ensure that
students stay engaged and aware by
not allowing them to lean heavily
on technology. One way this can be
done is by stressing in-class discus-
sion, through which teachers verify
that their students have a ﬁrm grasp
on what they’ve Googled.

Our society must proceed with
caution when accepting instant ac-
cess to information, since I believe
it has the potential to lead us into an
era of historical ignorance. I can re-
member being told countless times
by my 5th grade teacher to “look
up the word in the dictionary if you
don’t know it.” I had always thought
to myself, “How can I look it up if I
can’t spell it?” But it turns out Miss
Ayers wasteaching me more than I
knew at the time. She was encour-
aging me to ﬁnd the meanings of
the words. She was teaching me a
respect for knowledge.

tion and, at some point, economic
growth. As an example, the 1960s

saw the invention of specialized
shipping containers that could be

lifted from barges to railcars or
freight trucks, and this technol-

ogy dramatically reduced trans-
portation costs, thereby helping
fuel the post-war economic boom.

If the vast network of contempo-

rary human interactions could

be thought of as an economy of
sorts — exchange of verbal, visual’
“meanings” replacing exchange

of goods and services — and in-

extricably tied to the real econo-

my, then the recent advances in

electronic connectedness could

mirror the function of ca technol-

ogy; that is, smartphones and

Facebook are growing the human

network.

lditorlalrollcles

Here’s the crux: Our electroni-
cally connected America features
more human interaction per per-
son than our once-unplugged
America. That’s because our
new hardware and software have
reduced the cost of connecting
with not only friends, but club
members, coworkers, employ-
ers and even customers and pa-
tients, deﬁnitely in terms of time
and often in terms of money. And
with so much instant access to
what others are doing, the aver-
age person’s exposure to positive
social opportunities (and ability
to pursue those opportunities)
has skyrocketed. From scouting
for jobs to organizing revolutions
to memorializing friends who’ve
passed, everything’s easier, so
there’s more of everything.

FILM REVIEW

Strong character takes

the lead in Pixar’s ‘Brave’  

Natalie Bell
Senior Staff Writer

“Brave”

Starring; Kelly MacDonald,
Billy Connolly, and Emma
Thompson

Directed by: Mark Andrews,
Brenda Chapman and Steve
Purcell

Grade: A

Just as the main character of “Brave”

works to defy tradition, so does Pixar. ‘

Cartoon heroine Merida is every-
thing a typical leading lady is not.

She doesn’t ﬁt the beauty conven-
tions of today with her curly, ginger
locks, yet there’s never a critique of
her looks — she’s not considered
unattractive. Merida is bold and as-
sertive without being portrayed as a
completely hopeless tomboy. She’s
smart, while still being a child.

And she’s not hurrying to love.
Thank you, Pixar, for ﬁnally straying
from the traditional boy-meets—girl
romantic comedy formulathat seems
inextricably linkedwith afemale lead.

Instead, the plot follows main
character Merida’s relationship
with her mother, Elinor. The two
ﬁnd themselves at odds over the

proper decorum of a princess, such as ‘

whether Merida should work so hard
on her archery skills and whether she
should follow a tradition that involves
marryinga suitorwho wins herhand
in games.

In the midst of a quarrel, Merida
runs out and ﬁnds a mystical circle of
stones that lead her to a witch. There,
she rashly and regrettably wishes her
mother was different, only to acci-
dentally tum her into a bear. Bears
happen to be the king’s sworn enemy
after an incident that cost him his leg.

Merida ﬁnds out she must “mend
the bond torn by pride.” As she and
her mother venture through the mov-
ie trying to undo the spell, they learn
to appreciate each other. Though,
even then, there’s the small problem
of reversing the bear spell, which in-
volves some more humility.

The plucky, redheaded princess
who just wants the freedom to make
her own destiny brings a some-
what unconventional heroine to the
forefront. Blessedly, Merida isn’t a
preachy deﬁance of the norm, but in-
stead, she’sjust a pleasant deviation.

   

MCT CAMP S

Her character, while perhaps
somewhat more mature than the
average adolescent — she’s even ex-
ceptionally skilled in archery -— is
also someone you might be friends
with. And while the audience roots
for her to get out of a marriage to one
of the ridiculous suitors, it’s also ap-
parent that she’s somewhat petulant,
sometimes churlishly whining and
berating her mother.

“Brave,” like other Pixar ﬁlms, dis-
cusses parent—child relationships in
the movie, but it tackles the difficulty
of adolescence, as well. Merida is just
hitting the age where she begins to
deﬁne herself, a time when many
children’s relationships with their
parents change.

Frankly, it’s brave for the studio to
tackle such a stormy time in her life
without patronizing it too much. Ado-
lescence is a delicate subject matter to
discuss at a time when many parents
and children feel they’re walking on
eggshells around one another — after
all, the common adolescent phrase
“You just don’t understand” isn’t cli-
che for nothing.

And yet, both female characters
are endearing and have merit. This
is perhaps because the ﬁlm doesn’t
paint the issue in black and white.
Merida’s mother has a very narrow
view of appropriate behavior, but
Merida reacts to it in a childish and
explosive way.

Both of them deserve to apolo-
gize to the other and, inevitably, they
both do.

On another front, it’s refreshing
that Merida isn’t all consumed with

love. The movie doesn’t demoralize
traditional cinematic romance. It’s
just not on the character’s radar. She
has a very healthy view: She’ll get
married when she ﬁnds someone
she loves and feels ready, until then,
she’ll enjoy her family.

And that includes her clear, or
rather bear, mother. I

CONCERT REVlEW

Modest Mouse upholds the

good and bad of indie cred  

Indie rock band Modest Mouse came to Stage AE and hung the audience out to dry.

Andrew Gretchko
Senior Stew” Wrz'ter

Nearly three years after Modest
Mouse played the ﬁnal note on
its last North American tour, it
returned to a mere seven stages
across the country to give thou-
sands of lucky fans a chance to
see the indie rock legend.

However, being a rock legend
of any sort comes with the usual
antics.

After the crowd eagerly await-
ed the group’s arrival at Stage
AE on June 22, Modest Mouse
greeted it with a treat. Opening its
show with the fan favorite “Grav-
ity Rides Everything,” Modest
Mouse had the crowd’s immedi-
ate attention. The soft, melodic
guitar strums of The Moon &Ant-
arctica’s second track soon gave
way to “Bury Me With It,” a hit
off Modest Mouse’s later album
Good News For People Who Love
Bad News.

Judging by the reactions of the
members in the sold-out crowd,
the concert was going well. Tie-
dye clad 40-year-old hippies and
their preppier counterparts in
button—down shirts and pointed
leather dress shoes stood shoul-
der to shoulder, belting out every
word in unison, hands raised in
the air. Even the dozens of Zooey
Deschanel look-alikes who dotted
the crowd managed to show their
excitement and loudly voiced
their approval of the band’s per-

formance.

The crowd behind the pit was
no exception. Concert-goers
stood at attention and vigorously
applauded whenever they were
given the chance.

This wasn’t a concert for your
casual iPod owner. This was a
dream come true for the fans who
had taken the group’s lyrics to
heart for the past decade.

As Modest Mouse performed,
the audience sent out screams of
adoration and gazed wide-eyed
at lead singer Isaac Brock. The
night was young and the music
the band performed spanned
across its many albums.

Then the microphone began
to squeak.

Maybe it was the way Brock as-
saulted the mic, grabbing it by the
throat and yelling directly into
its metal face. More than likely
it was a technical difficulty, as
a technician came on stage hur-
riedly to set up a new microphone
for Brock, who wasted no time in
abusing the new piece of equip-
ment.

All technical mishaps aside,
Brock and the six—piece crew,
including two drummers, man-
aged to put on the type of show
the true Modest Mouse fans had
paid good money for. The band
left out the overplayed radio hit
“Float On,” but it replaced it with
tracks such as “Satin in a Cofﬁn”
that were more in tune with the
key of the die—hard fans. Even its

~ instrumentation went against the

grain of the mainstream, ‘ditch-
ing bass guitars_for string basses
and electric guitars for banjos and
ukuleles.

After winning the crowd over ~

with its compelling lyrics, dy-
namic musical sound and inter-
esting instrumentation, the con-
cert took a steep dive, and not the
type where the front row of fans
catch a leaping rock star.

With a half-hearted good-
night, Brock and Modest Mouse
departed the stage. Although they
weren’t fooling anyone —— for a
band of this caliber, an encore is
not only expected, it’s guaranteed

—- the elongated standstill upset ‘

the crowd.

Substituting guitar solos and
poetic lyrics forthe sounds of
cicadas chirping, Modest Mouse
left its fans stranded at sea for al-
most fifteen minutes before once
again taking its place on stage.

Whether it was merely a much-
needed break for the band or
flat-out arrogance, the crowd
seemed visibly upset, and even a
multi—song encore couldn’t fill the
void left by its previous absence.
Whatever it was, the band’s ren-
dition of Bob Dylan’s “You Ain’t
Goin’ Nowhere” was not enough
to ‘make amends, as the anticli—
mactic outro left fans yearning
for more.

Banjos, string basses, micro-
phone mishaps and awkward end-
ings: indie rock at it’s ﬁnest. H

The ﬁrst two seconds of the self-titled
release feature Murphy exclaiming an ex-
cited “Ow! Ow!” — a seemingly impromptu
proclamation that blatantly deﬁed the tone
of many highly regarded records from the
time. In just two seconds, Murphy told the
world that he was here and ready to have
a good time.

blaze the electronic trail. The song titled
“Daft Punk Is Playing at My House” showed
that it was possible to blend the guitar-
heavy sound of the re—emerging punk scene
of New York City with danceable beats in-
ﬂuenced by various electronic music acts.
The album blended electronic and punk
music in a way that allowed fans of both

I The Strokes and/Four Tet to come together

and enjoy one band.

In addition to creating this hybrid musi-
cal experiment, Murphy wrote compelling
lyrics that both celebrated and criticized
music fans who avoid the Top-40 radio
stations.

On the track “Losing my Edge,” Mur-
phy condemns the bloated pretentious-
ness of proud hipsters who unabashedly
celebrate the fact that they participate in
the underground music scene. In a perfectly
angry tone, Murphy calls out “art school

 

Must be 21 to Drink Proper ID Required

And the rest of the album continued to

Brooklynites in little jackets and borrowed
nostalgia for the unremembered eighties”
for their assumed musical superiority.

Murphy later scolds a generation of af-
fected musicians with lines such as “I hear
that you and your band have sold your gui- K,
tars and bought turntables. / I hear that you
and your band have sold your turntables
and bought guitars.”

James Murphy was unafraid to criticize
the very people who would buy and critique
his art. This boldly disparaging attitude
mixed with original and catchy music made
his ﬁrst album an instant classic.

Murphy’s own DFA Records released
the record to critical acclaim, but, more
importantly, it acted as a springboard for
the band that released three iconic albums

(20o5’s LCD Soundsystem, 2oo7’s Sound .,_._,

of Silver, and 2010’s This Is Happening),
which all included songs that litter many of
our generation’s ideal party soundtracks.
Subsequent songs, such as “Someone
Great,” “All My Friends,” “New York, I Love
You But You’re Bringing Me Down” and
“You Wanted a Hit,” show that Murphy
could accomplish a great deal in one song.
He could write thought-provoking tracks

Adams, Wﬁght with

dominating performances
at Greentree Pro—Am

Pat McAteer
S taﬁ” Writer

After a ﬁrst week of solid showings
from several Pitt men’s basketball

players, the Pittsburgh Basketball

Club Summer Pro-Am league re-
turned to action onJune 25 at the
Greentree SportsPlex with two
matchups featuring dominant per-

formances by current and future

Panthers.
PGT Trucking 67, SPK Law 66

In his debut last week, Steven
Adams, Pitt’s highly—rated incom-
ing recruit from New Zealand,
showed ﬂashes of the talent that
has the attention of NBA scouts
as he registered six points and 18
rebounds.

But on Monday night, the
7—foot tall Adams put his full ar-
senal on display.

Showing of a slick hook shot,
Adams scored 15 points and added
13 rebounds to lead a comeback
for PGT Trucking.

“We were down early, but it was
good that we started ﬁghting and
were able to come back,” Adams
said following the game.

After a ﬁrst half featuring slop-
py play by both teams, PGT Truck-

ping trailed SPK Law heading into

the break. But midway through
the second half, Adams and fellow
Pitt newcomer Trey Zeigler, who
recently transferred to Pitt from
Central Michigan, sparked an 8-0
run for PGT Trucking that changed
the game.

On SPK Law’s next possession,
Adams registered two of his eight
blocks against fellow Panther Tal-
ib Zanna, leading to an alley—oop
pass from Indiana University of
Pennsylvania graduate Ashton
Smith to Zeigler.

After a miss by SPK Law on its.

next possession, incoming Pitt '

freshman point guardjames Rob-
inson then launched an impres-
sive full-court pass to Zeigler for
another easy bucket.

Robinson, who played in his

ﬁrst game with his Pitt teammates
last night after winning a gold
medal with the United States U-18
team in Brazil, said the game was
an opportunity to bond with team-
mates in a game environment.

“It was (kind of like a pickup
game, but as you saw, when the
game got tight, everybody picked
up the intensity, and we’re just try-
ing to win,” Robinson said.

Adams, who said it was his
ﬁrst time playing with Robinson,
was impressed with his future Pitt
teammate’s performance.

“Everyone seems to be more
conﬁdent with [Robinson] around
because he always makes the right
decisions with the ball,” Adams
said.

Zeigler scored the game’s de-
cisive basket, converting a clutch
hoop after a steal. He ﬁnished with
14 points and seven rebounds in
his second game of the league.

Pitt sophomore guard John
Johnson led the way for SPK Law
with 14 points and four assists.

SPK Law, which now holds a
0-2 record in the league, will face
South Hills Audi on June 27 at 7
p.m., while the 2-0 PGT Trucking
face fellow undefeated squad GNC

that same day at 9 p.m.

UPMC 89, Steel City Tickets
60

After posting a solid offen-
sive performance in his team’s
opening game last week against
Oliverio’s Peppers, Pitt redshirt
sophomore guard Cameron Wright
said he spent the last few months

, improving his offensive game, par-

ticularly his mid-range jump shot.

On Monday night, it was clear
that Wright’s work had begun pay-
ing off.

Wright scored a league-leading
25 points against a depleted Steel
City Tickets squad as he led UPMC
to its second victory of the sum-
mer league. Playing both guard
positions, he added seven assists

Barnes: McDonald’s new
approach helps young pitcher
find success in Pirates’ rotation

Pittsburgh Pirate James McDonald has hecomeone of the best pitchers in baseball this season. MCT Campus

Nate Barnes
Stqff Writer

Most Major League Baseball fans
recognize the two household
names on this season’s Pitts-
burgh Pirates roster — Andrew
McCutchen and A.J. Burnett.

But in 2012, another player
is making his name just as well-
known throughout the league:
James McDonald.

McDonald’s acquisition has
undoubtedly proven to be the
best trade made by general man-
ager Neal Huntington so far. In
July 2010, Huntington shipped
veteran relief pitcher Octavio Do-
tel to the Los Angeles Dodgers in
exchange for McDonald and an-
other minor leaguer. At the time
of the trade, the Dodgers had
relegated McDonald to bullpen
duty as he carried an unimpres-
sive 8.22 earned run average.

But in his three months with
the Pirates at the end of the 2010

yr:

campaign, McDonald showed
ﬂashes of his potential as a start-
ing-pitcher. He recorded a 2-2
record and a much-improved 2.31
ERA, with his seven shutout in-
nings against the eventual win-
ners of the National League Wild
Card, the Atlanta Braves, being
his highlight performance.

Unfortunately, as the Pirates
were finishing a miserable 57-105
season, few were paying atten-
tion to see the potential in Mc-
Donald.

In 2011, McDonald continued
to improve, as he bounced back
from a rough month in April to
post four straight months with
an ERA of 3-93 or lower, win-
ning seven of 10 decisions in that
span. McDonald, alongside fellow
starters Charlie Morton, Kevin
Correia and Jeff Karstens, was

an integral part of the Pirates’ 

success in the ﬁrst four months
of the season.

Overall, McDonald ﬁnished c
the 2011 season with career

highs in nearly every statistical
category, posting a 9-9 record,

‘4.21 ERA, 171 innings pitched,

142 strikeouts, 78 walks and 15
quality starts in 31 games.

In 2012, those following the
Pirates have seen an even greater
improvement in McDonald, who
seems to have taken the leap to
becoming one of baseball’s pre-
mier pitchers.

“J—Mac”, as many Pirates fans
call him, is 6-3 with a minuscule
2.19 ERA —— third-best in the
majors — and his 0.95 WHIP
(walks and hits allowed per in-
nings pitched) conﬁrms just how

With 85 strikeouts and only 24
walks surrendered, he appears
to be well on his way to shatter-
ing all of his career highs from
last season.

\ The biggest difference with
McDonald this season doesn’t lie
just within his pitching itself, but

TASSER.’S TAKE

S/7670 begins Penguins’ roster
Wanfonnation a/aeaa’ of new season

Donnie Tasser
Staff Wrz'ter

Pittsburgh Penguins general manager Ray
Shero controversially and signiﬁcantly altered
his team’s roster late last week.

The Steel City hosted the NHL Entry Draft

June 22-23, at which Shero made headlines by
trading centerjordan Staal to begin transform-
ing the team after a disappointing 2011-2012
campaign that ended with a disastrous ﬁrst-
round playoff exit.

The main question in the back of every Pens
fan’s mind heading into the draft was the future
logjam at the center position and what Shero
was going to do about it.

Sidney Crosby, Evgeni Malkin and Staal had
previously given Pittsburgh the most skill down
the middle of any team in the league, but every-
one knew that because of salary cap restrictions,
there would be no way for the Penguins to keep
all three.

So after Staal, 23, turned downa1o—year con-
tract extension last week, it became evident that
itwas only a matter of time before he left town.

When it came time for the Carolina Hurri-
canes to announce their ﬁrst-round choice last
Friday at the draft, NHL Commissioner Gary
Bettman shocked a crowd comprised mostly
of Penguins fans by announcing that the Pens
had traded Staal to the Hurricanes for center
Brandon Sutter, defenseman Brian Dumoulin
and Carolina’s ﬁrst-round pick.

Raucous applause followed the announce-
ment at the Consol Energy Center, and it only
continued when the Pens announced they used
the pick to draft defenseman Derrick Pouliot.

But Shero wasn’t done altering the Penguins’
roster. V

Later that day, he sent defenseman Zbynek
Michalek to Phoenix for athird-round selection
and two prospects, giving the Penguins $4 mil-
lion more in salary—cap space in the process.

Then, the Pens used their other ﬁrst-round
choice ~‘— 22nd overall — to draft rugged Finn-
ish defenseman Olli Maatta.

While a majority of fans were upset about
seeing the popular Staal go -— and many more
were upset that it was Michalek, not defensive
counterpart Paul Martin, who was traded —

both trades made perfect sense for the Penguins. '

Sutter is ayoung, defensive-minded center,
just like Staal, and is expected to ﬁll the latter’s
role on the third line nicely. Staal, coming offa
breakout season, had expressed interest in a
larger role in the offense, whichwas impossible
for the Penguins to promise with Crosby and
Malkin rightfully ahead of him on the depth
chart. A
The trade also made sense for Staal, who
will get to play alongside his older brother Eric
in Carolina. Carolina also has Staal’s younger
brotherjared in its minor league system.]ordan

who plays for the New York Rangers) at some

point in his career.

And it’s no surprise that Shero seems to be
stockpiling young, talented defensemen after
the disastrous postseason performance by the
defense against the Philadelphia Flyers.

Following Michalek’s exit, the Pens will likely
be aggressors on the free agency scene, which
begins onjuly 1.

The two names that have been linked to the

Pens also happen to be two of the biggest names

on the free agent market —former Newjersey
Devils captain Zach Parise and defenseman
Ryan Suter, formerly of the Nashville Predators.

Parise is known to be a good friend of Cros-
by’s, and the Penguins’ captain said he would
do everything in his power to try and convince
the diminutive forward to pass up more money
elsewhere to become his linemate in Pittsburgh.

Suter, however, ﬁgures to be the Penguins’
top priority. The Pens need atop-ﬂight defense-
man to pair with Kris Letang, and Suter would
be aperfect ﬁt.

To sign both marquee free agents, the Pens
would likely have to clear more cap room, which
could be done by trading or releasingthe under-
achieving and mistake—prone Martin. While a
solid player in Newjersey, Martin has not lived
up to expectations or his $5 million cap hit in his
two years with Pittsburgh. Still, he is drawing
some interest, as teams believe that Martin is
simply not a good ﬁt for the Penguins’ system.

Earlierthis month, Shero also traded forvet—
eran goalie Tomas Vokoun, sending a seventh-
round pick to the Washington Capitals. Vokoun
has plenty of experience, and he is expected
to back up starter Marc-Andre Fleury, giving
Fleury more rest than in past seasons to keep
him fresh for the playoffs.

Going forward, look for Crosby to sign a .
contract extension with the'Penguins soon,
and don’t be surprised if Martin isn’t here for
much longer.

’ The Penguins’ roster may change alot more
this offseason — it’s no secret that Ray Shero
wasn’t happy with the way last season ended,
and he isn’t going to let it happen again. I

GREENTREE

    

Cameron Wright scored 25 points at Greentree on Monday night. Luv Purohit [Visual Editor

in a dominant performance for both Wright
and UPMC.

Feeding off Wright’s strong showing, Pitt
sophomore center Malcolm Gilbert posted
a double—double with 12 points and 13 re-
bounds in his most impressive offensive
performance since his arrival in Pittsburgh
last year. Gilbert displayed an effective scor-
ing touch on the offensive end, adding to
his already-formidable defensive presence.

Wright said that he and Gilbert, along
with the rest of his Pitt teammates, relish
the opportunity to play on the same team
during the summer league because of the
chemistry gained during the college bas-
ketball season.

“I love playing with Malcolm [Gilbert]
as well as I love playing with all of my other
teammates,” Wright said. “For us to just
come out here — all of us Pitt Panthers
playing together — it’s great.”

Pitt senior forward Dante Taylor and
redshirt freshman guard Durand Johnson
didn’t play for the Steel City Tickets this
week because of minor injuries. With Taylor
and West Virginia University sophomore
Pat Forsythe out with injuries, Steel City
Tickets struggled to match Gilbert’s height.

UPMC, which holds a 2-1 record, faces
GNC onjuly 2 at 8 p.m., while the 0-3 Steel
City Tickets play Oliverio’s Peppers at 8 p.m.

rather in his approach to the game.

McDonald recently acknowledged that
he used to lose focus on the mound, espe-
cially when he got in jams.

“When certain guys got up there, I
would think about, ‘What if this happens?
What if that happens?’ Now, I really don’t
care,” he said. “I just see that there’s a
hitter up there, and I’ve got ajob to do,
which is to get him out. I’m just going af-
ter people, so my mental approach to the
game is different. It’s more than just the
stuff. It’s the mental side of it that’s mak-
ing me better.”

Another big difference in McDonald’s
pitching this season is his ability to adapt
to different situations. While all pitchers
like to rely on their fastball, McDonald
has shown in many pressure situations
this season that he is not afraid to throw
any one of his pitches at any time, another
very important characteristic of a domi-
nant pitcher.

McDonald’s performances this season
should earn him a trip to the All-Star Game
injuly, along with Burnett and McCutchen,
and he still has a chance to pick up some
hardware when the season culminates in
the form of the Cy Young Award, given to
the best pitcher in each league.

But‘ more importantly for the Pirates, he
needs to keep helping them win ballgames.
Although he has only received a deci-

sion in nine of his 14 starts, the Pirates

are 10-5 overall when McDonald takes the
mound. That record is the second best of
any pitcher on the Pirates’ staff — behind
only Burnett. The Pirates are 10-2 in Bur-
nett’s 12 starts this season.

Speaking of Burnett, his impact on the
young pitcher cannot be overlooked.

With the lessons learned and knowledge
gained over the course of Burnett’s 13-year
career, many attribute the improvement
in McDonald’s mental state to the advice _

given to him by the experienced pitcher?‘

as well as veteran catcher Rod Barajas.

Armed with wisdom from veterans, as
well as an electric repertoire of pitches, ex-
pect McDonald to continue his dominance
for the rest of this season and beyond.

Players like McDonald and McCutchen
give Pirates fans hope for the future as
the club seems to have an ace pitcher and
a stud center fielder in place for years to
come.

Later down the line, McDonald will
hopefully lead a four-headed monster
pitching staff consisting of himself and
the Pirates’ recent first-round pitching
draft picks — Gerrit Cole, who is tearing
up the minor leagues,_]ameson Taillon and
Mark Appel.

But players like McDonald also give fans
hope for the present.

With the Pirates holding a record above
.500 heading intojuly for the second year
in a row, the club’s present is looking just
as bright as its future. I
