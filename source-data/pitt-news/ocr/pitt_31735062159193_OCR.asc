Little Hope Is Held
Out For Automobile

Industry By Columnist

By RAY C. MacINTYRE

Something new in the way of
precedents was established by
the American automobile in-
dustry last week when 46,000
dealers in all makes of cars co-
operated at the behest of manu-
facturers in a desperate, al-
most hysterical campaign to
“move” the bumper crop of used
cars which is glutting the Ameri-
can market today.

Automobile leaders claim that
two used cars must be sold for
every new car sold. Otherwise
the bait of a trade-in allowance on
new cars cannot be offered. It is
intimated that the production of
1938 new cars will be based on
the sales of used cars as a result
of the National Used Car Week
campaign.

The industry affords in its pre-
dicament one of the most beauti-
ful paradoxes of present-day bus-
iness sanctions ever created.

The single unassailable premise
to be gleaned from the present
situation is that the public is not
making use, whether because of
choice or necessity, of all the
serviceable automobiles available.

Free Solutions

Which, as we have intimated in
the premise, might be due to the
fact that people lack the money to
buy, or that they simply have been
surfeited with automobiles. If the
former be the case, we offer these
solutions for consideration.

1. That industry as a whole
might cooperate to give the public
money to buy, pay full—time wages
for part—time work if necessary,
i. e., divide up what work there is
and maintain wages as they were
before.

But this, from the standpoint of
industry, would never do. How
could the program be accom-
plished so as yet to allow pay-
ment of regular stock dividends,
interest on bonds, salaries of di-
rectors and executives, and a fair
proﬁt besides? Pas possible! And,
we are asked, what’s the point of
being in business if you can’t show
a proﬁt?

2. That the principle of auto-
mobile manufacturing be alerted
somewhat. Instead of making au-
tomobiles which help to clutter up
roads for nine years (average
length of life), why not start man-
ufacturing cars that are positive-
ly, absolutely guaranteed to fall
apart in less than two years? The
market will thus be kept clear by
quick depreciation.

Limited Life

Yet this principle is hardly a
novelty. The automobile indus-
try itself has recognized it in a
moderate way for quite some
time. _

According to the Journal of
the Society of Automotive En-
gineers, “the average car operates
only about 2,100 hours before be-
ing relegated to the junk heap; in-
dustrial equipment having the
same life would last only 262.5
days on an 8-hour schedule.” It
is pointed out that the machines
which make the cars will last
eight or ten times longer than the
products which they turn out.

If, on the other hand, the real
diﬁiculty is overproduction rather
than underconsumption because of
lack of purchasing power, it would
be possible to:

1. Junk all automobiles beyond
a given age. But this is fantastic,
absurd, utterly impossible, we are
told. Some of the cars thus sum-
marily disposed of would be good
cars. Both their utility value and
large trade-in allowances would
be lost.

2. Build fewer cars and be sat-
isﬁed with smaller sales and less
proﬁt. But what about paying
dividends on the excess plant
which represents money already
invested?

And what are all these men
thrown out of work going to do?

Raise hell, no doubt!

Will Speak
Here Today

Harvard Expert
To Point Out Use
Of X-Ray In Art

Edward VValdo Forbes, di-
rector of the Fogg Art museum
at Harvard university, is to
speak this afternoon at 4
o’clock in the department of
ﬁne arts, seventh ﬂoor, Cathe-
dral on detecting forgeries in
art’.

Mr. Forbes, lecturer on ﬁne
arts at Harvard since 1909, has
titled his lecture: “Value of Tech-
nical Study to a Fine Arts Depart-
ment——the Use of X—ray, Ultra-
violet, and Infra—red Light in De-
tecting Original Works of Art.”
Faculty members, students, and
the general public have been in-
vited to the meeting.

At present an adviser of “Tech-
nical Studies i.n the Field of Fine
Arts,” Mr. Forbes was given an
LL.D., by the University in 1927.
He has been a trustee of the Mu-
seum of Fine Arts in Boston for
several years.

The large collection in the Harv-
ard Museum has been largely due
to the efforts of Mr. Forbes. The
ﬁne arts department at Harvard is
one of the oldest in the country,
and with Princeton, it represents
the foremost place in the United
States for the study of fine arts. _

Yearbook To Feature
Pictorial Presentation
Of Campus Activities

The undergraduate subscrip-
tion campaign of the 1938 Owl
ofﬁcially ends today, according
to Sam VVerlinich, BA38, busi-
ness manager.

No subscriptions will be ac-
cepted after today, \Verlinich
explains, because “the Owl has
a limited edition, and only books
that have been ordered will be
printed.”

Orders for the book may be
given on the ground ﬂoor Cathe-
dral, in the Owl office at 801 Ca-
thedral, or to undergraduate
salesmen. A down payment of
$1.50 is required, and the balance
of $2.00 will be paid upon receipt
of the book.

Idella Rome, Ed38, editor,
stresses the fact that the 1938 Owl
will be of interest to all under-
graduates, because it will include
in pictorial form all phases of Uni-
versity life and activity. Photo-
graphy has been emphasized more
than ever before.

The yearbook will be divided

University Planner Announces

Opening Date Of Heinz Chapel

According to
Klimcheck of the planning de-
partment in the Cathedral, Heinz
Chapel will be completed by the
ﬁrst of June.

With the arrival next week of
the bronze frames for the clere-
story windows, work on the in-
stallation of the ﬁnal group of
windows will begin, said Mr.
Klimcheck.

These windows follow the early
century style of those in the chan-
cellory of the Chapel. Composed
of small pieces of glass, they are
held together by strips of lead.
The lead is -to be wired to the
brown spars on the bronze frames.

In making these windows,
Charles Connick used glass made
by the famous Sandwich glass
makers of Cape Cod, Mass. Noted
for its clearness of color and trans-
parency, this glass is approximate-
ly 50 years old.

GOTHIC DECORATIONS

.The artist who designs stained
glass windows gets the colored
glass from various sources, usual-
ly from the source noted for the
color. For instance, Germany
might make the best green glass,
and the United States the best red
glass. If the color is not quite
the shade the artist desires, he can
burn more color into the glass.
The added color will be just as

Mr. Albert A.O—————

permanent as the original.

The Gothic wood work for the
gallery seats, pews, console organ
stall, rails, and all other wood-
work is in the process of con-
struction now, said Mr. Klim-
check. Following as closely as
possible the same style as that
made centuries ago in France and
England, the woodwork fashioned
of English powdered oak, the ﬁn-
est wood for Gothic work, is be-
ing made by Irving and Casson of
Boston.

BIBLICAL SYMBOLS

At present a stone carver is
working on the shields on the tri-
forium, or gallery level of the
chapel. These carvings are to be
biblical symbols representing va-
rious personalities of the Bible.

Lighting ﬁxtures and hardware
for the doors are being made by
Samuel Yellin, a famous wrought
iron craftsman of Philadelphia,
who also made the iron work in
the Commons Room of the Cathe-
dral.

Mr. Klimcheck described the
Chapel as “an architectural gem,”
and said that in designing the
building, they have tried to cap-
ture the characteristics of the
carvings and work in the famous
cathedrals ’ of France and Eng-
land.

A
V

general public, will vary from
other programs, containing music
of a more popular type.

Opening the performance with
the Alma Mater, the Glee Club
will present the “Border Ballad”
by Coeven; “The Broken Melody”
by Sibelius; and “Death, I Do Not
Fear Thee” by Bach. Following
these three pieces, Robert Brown,
C39, cellist of the University Or-
chestra, will play the “Andante”
by Mozart and “Playera” by
Granados. He will be accompan-
ied on the piano by Harry Goldby,
C39.

QUARTET TO SING

The Quartet will sing the next
group of numbers, starting with
“The Spirit Flower” by Campbell-
Tipton. Other numbers by the
quartet will be “The Battle of
Jericho,” a negro spiritual; and
the “Ranger’s Song” by Tierney.

Tenor soloist William Cover,
C38, will sing four selections in-
cluding a song by Stephen Collins
Foster. They are “Il Mio Tesoro”
from the opera “Don Giovanni”
by Mozart, “Come Where My Love
Lies Dreaming” by Foster, “Sum-
mer Night” by Foerster, and
“Jeannie With the Light Brown
Hair,” also by Foerster.

PART TWO

Opening the second half of the
program, the Glee Club will sing
Oley Speak’s “On the Road to
Mandalay;” a negro spiritual,
“Standin’ in the Need 0’ Prayer;”
and “The Lost Chord” by Sullivan
of operetta fame.

Returning to the operatic ﬁeld,
Andrew Feyka, basso, will sing
“Di Provenza il Mar” from Verdi’s
“La Traviata.”

A Scotch Aid will be featured
on the program when the Glee
Club sings “There Was a Lad Was
Born in Kyle.” Another piece by
Foerster, “The Voyagers,” and
“Long Ago in Alcala” by Messager
will ﬁnish the regular portion of_
the program.

ALUMNI JOIN IN ” " 7'
As has been done in-past Glee
Club concerts, alumni "members of‘
the organization will sing the Uni-
versity Songs with the regular
members. A Dutch Prayer of‘
Thanksgiving followed by “Hail to
Pitt” will be the concluding num--
bers sung by the combined student.
and alumni members of the Glee
Club.
Consisting of 60 members, the
Glee Club is the oldest non-ath-
letic activity at the University.

The White Plague
And A Senior Queen ,

PPEARING in the March 5, 1987 issue
A of The Pitt News was a. story from which
we offer the following excerpt:

“Ruth Farrell Bowser, C34, ninth Sen-
ior Queen at the University, died late \Ved-
nesday evening in Phoenix, Arizona after
an extended illness that began shortly
after her graduation from the College in
the class of June, 1934 . . -

“In early fall of 1934, Miss Bowser did
personnel work in a downtown department
store for two weeks. She was Stricken
with illm 3, however, and since that time
her healtl has been failing gradually . . -"’
This was the story that appeared in the

News In accordance wit.h usual journalistic
practice, mention of the disease with which
Miss Bowser was infected and which led to her
‘death was not made. But, in what we think
is a justifiable editorial break, we wish to
speak more exactly at this time.

Miss Bowser, although it was not mentioned
in the News story, had developed and died of
tuberculosis. The disease had already gained
headway before it was recognized, had gained
such headway that the only possible medica-
tion, when effected, was found useless.

’l‘u*be‘rcu'iosis had been recognized too late,
and Miss Bowser, taking treatment in a sani-
torium in Arizona, was unable to defeat the
disease and recover her health.

lVe draw this case in point: had the disease
been recognized in time, Miss Bowser would
be living now.

\Ve break with editorial ethics to draw what
some might call a moral. And if it is a moral,
so let it be.

‘Ne are sponsorng with the cooperation of
the Student Health Service a campaign for the
testing and detection of tuberculosis, because
we are aware of its necessity. \Ve recognize
that tuberculosis is found to be most pre-
valent in young people of college age; we un-
derstand that, in the series of tests made in
1932 of 38,000 college students a 32 per cent
positive reaction was found.

W’ e are determined to use all the means
avaiiable to us to impress upon students at the
Uiiiversity the need and the value of taking
the tuberculosis tests.

0=,n-,=;- 4,001) young people, representing 100,000
American youths, comprised a delegation which
came to Washington to express their needs and
demands for constructive social legislation. Dele-
gates attended sessions of the House of Repre-
sen-‘satives, appeared before the Senate hearings on
the Aignerican Youth Act, and intereviewed Sena-
tors and Congressmen.

The most signiﬁcant aspect of the pilgrimage
was tiie 'stre:'s laid upon economic and political
implications of the situation that brought 4,000
young people to Washington asking for jobs and
educations.

At the Senate hearings, for example, William
Hinkley. chairman of the National Council of the
AYC, was questioned about the “subversive” in-
ﬁuence of Socialist and Communist organizations
working with the Youth Congress. Hinkley, who
is not affiliated with a political movement, de-
fended the “radicals” as constructive and progres-
5' 'e, saying that they were sincerely loyal to the
1% interests of the American people and that they

naturally were opposed, therefore, to those groups,

which stand in the way of progress.

Supipdrti of:President Ro'osevelt’s foreign policy
of quarantining the agressor, and of his domestic
program of exerting government control of indus-
try, it was suggested, play an important part in the
future of American youth.

Representative Teagen, in an interview with a
delegate from the University, claimed that event-
ual government control over industry is essential
t») economic stability, and representative O’Con-
nell pointed out the necessity for the neutrality bill,
in order to make the U. S. an effective force for
world peace. I _ '-

Generally. the sentiment among supporters of
the AYC was that jobs and education for youth
can beobtained only in an atmosphere of delib-
erate planning to stabilize domestic and world
economy.

By Jean Barnes

The number of people is legion who write, think,
talk, worry, in terms of today’s foreign situation.
I think that I shall, for a few minutes, join that
group. ' '

-Let us take for a premise the fact that this is the
most important crisis since 1914. Let us assume
that a war is looming large which I sincerely be-
lieve.

What will happen in the next few weeks?
you know? Well, I don’t know, but I can imagine
a lot. England, in the position of a Mediterranean
power, as indeed the world’s controlling economic
power, is on the spot. She must maintain the bal-
ance of power, which she can do by siding with
Germany—or with Italy.

Should she choose Germany, I believe her ad-
vantages would be few and slim. It has been well
illustrated in the last few months that Hitler doesn’t
want any “and Company” tacked on his name, and
it is pretty well certain that Britain won’t bend the
knee to a paper-hanger.

Mussolini is just now the under-dog. He and
Hitler had been well matched for a few years; now
ll Duce is on the down-grade, and he is smart
enough to know it. The Rome-Berlin axis will
break up, if Mussolini’s ambition doesn’t vanish in
the meantime-—and I don’t think it will. I don’t
think he’ll ever become a cog in I-Iitler’s war ma-
chine.

So England’s most logical move is to take sides
with Italy, whose borders are a little too much
crowded by Hitler’s latest move. But will Cham-
berlain and Mussolini be able to reach the sort of
compromise that will do anything more substantial
than act as a face-saver? I doubt it. At least, they
will not reach a treaty openly for a few more weeks.

There is a ray of dark humour in the fact that
Germany is forcing itself into the Balkan states—
which may leave Hitler holding a Very large stick
of dynamite in his already too full hands. The
Balkans have been a load of trouble for everyone
so far; it would be too much to hope that they will
prove a bundle of sunshine now.

So we have England and Italy—perhaps France,
perhaps Russia, if she feels that England will later
take sides in the Oriental situation—allied against
Germany, Austria and the Balkans, with Japan a
doubtful and busy quantity.

I think the entire business depends right now on
Hitler’s arnbition——whether he will continue to be
a clever statesman, (which wepcannot deny he has
been), or whether he will go a little too far and
overbalance his war machine with a number of
futile economic and political worries.

I hope for America’s sake he does just ‘that.

Trade:

Reciprocal Agreements Likely
To Be A Great Peace Force

By JOSEPH McCLOSKEY
For those who consider the reciprocal trade agreements
program the greatest force for peace in the world today, the ne-
gotiation of the Anglo-American pact,» following immediately

upon the heels of the annexation of Austria by Hitler, holds.

especialinterest and signiﬁcance.
These treaties have as their immediate objective the in-

crease of commerce between the

United States and other nations

of the world on a “most-favored-
nation” principle. Their ultimate
result, if carried to their logical
conclusion, will
be the elimina-
tion of a great
part ofthe eco-
nomic national-
ism which has
risen to plague
the world since
the imperialist
expansion o f
the last half of
the nineteenth
century and of
the ﬁrst decades
of this century.

This combination of nationalism
and imperialism provided a great
part of the fuel from which the
last war was kindled-—and is the
philosophic basis for the present
demands of Germany, Italy, and
Japan for a place in the sun. Any
action designed to reduce the fric-
tion generated by such a national-
imperialist policy can be regarded
only as a force for peace.

To what" extent can the recipro-
cal trade agreements, as an ele-
ment of international policy, be
successful? The Anglo-American
pact will go far toward answering
this question, for the trade be-
tween the contracting parties has
been relatively well-balanced dur-
ing the last few years. Therefore,
an agreement upon broad princi-
ples should not be difficult of at-
tainment.

The success of this treaty will,
as a result, be measured in terms
of the willingness of both sides to
make real concessions in order to

 

Mccloskey

strengthen the economic ties
which bind the two together. A
genuinely reciprocal agreement

will, without involving military
commitments, provide the basis
for what is probably the most ef-
fective type of collective security
in a war-torn world.

For, when two nations are en-
gaged in the peaceful exchange of
goods on an equitable basis. there
is no excuse for war between
them, and they are intent upon
preventing any interruption of
that commerce by a third power.

And that is where the possibil-
ity of a real test of the weight of
these agreements lies in the pres-
ent situation: will the fact that
the United States and Czechoslo-
vakia are bound by one of these
agreements in any way alfect Hit-
ler’s attitude toward the latter na-
tion? ..

In other words, has Hitler suffi-

cient mental acumen to realize .

that reprisals on the part of the
United States, and now, of Eng-
land as well, might result from the
inclusion of the Czech nation
within the ring of Hitlerian self-
sufﬁciency, to the detriment of the
trade which is developing between
the United States and Czechoslo-
vakia?

Well.

Letters
Editor: The Pitt News:

I wish to thank you on behalf of
the potential Pitt Chess Club, for
your satiric Stalemate of Chess
Propagandists editorial appearing
in the issue of March 11. May I
assure you that the Chess Club

will endeavor to restrict its activ-
ities to conform with University

 

standards through the following
observations:
(1) The team will be picked

at random-—as you suggest—from
the.Tuck Shop and other hang-
outs (such as The News office or
the Women’s ping-pong tourna-
ment.)

(2) Moves used by foreigners
will not be allowed, but only those
advocated by American masters,
such as Marshall or Fine.

(3) Radical discussion during
the matches will be eliminated.
Conversation will be conﬁned to
such approved topics as Tonsilec-
tomies, or, Problems of The Youth
of Today.

(4) “Sly gambits and slinky
traps” will be forbidden. Players
will keep their opponents inform-
ed of their designs, and all attacks
or defenses will be announced at
least three moves in advance.

And when the venerable game
of chess has been so purged, may
THE PITT NEWS and the UNI-
VERSITY consider tolerating such
activity. And may someone-
anyone—furnish a nice, big, soft,
sombre, black crepe.

C. W. PHILLIPS, BA39,
Pres. Pitt Chess Club.

Prominent Artist Works
In University Library

, By ALICE BENOVITZ

The last place one would expect to ﬁnd a well-known artist
is in the catalogue department of the University library, but
that ’s just where we found Jeannette Shirk. Miss Shirk, who
has been painting for years, joined the library staff this De-

cember.

A member of the Associated Artists of Pittsburgh for the

past 16 years, and a frequent
exhibitor, Miss Shirk was one of
the few artists to sell a work in
the current exhibition of this or-
ganization. Of her three water
colors she sold two, “Sinbad Car-
ried Oﬁ by the Elephants,” and
“Fairy Tale,” both delightful
paintings of children’s stories.

However, it is not in water col-
ors, but in pen and ink illustra-
tions that she is most interested.
She reminisced, “I became enthu-
siastic about pen and ink work in
high school, and followed it
through at Carnegie Tech.”

ILLUSTRATES BOOKS

Miss Shirk has illustrated a
number of privately-printed books.
The best known of these is “Con-
cert,” a book of poems by George
Seibel, which has run through the
ﬁrst edition.

Probably her biggest thrill. was
in 1936, when her book, “Bela, the
Juggler,” won second prize in a
contest sponsored by the Julia
Elsworth Ford Foundation. The
book, which was awarded $300,
was written for children between
the ages of six and 12. The irony
of the situation was that by the
time Miss Shirk had written to the
foundation that professionally she
was an illustrator, they had se-
cured another artist for her book.

Miss Shirk, who is very modest
about her work, ﬁnally said, “I’ve
exhibited paintings in New York,
Philadelphia, and Chicago, and
have had many one-man shows in
other cities.” ‘ ’

Like most Pittsburgh artists,

Miss Shirk sadly admitted Pitts-
burgh is far from being an artist’s
paradise. Of all the cities in
America it is probably the most
difﬁcult to “sell” on art. Also,
like most artists, Miss Shirk would
like to live in New York. She ex-
pressed a universal feeling, when
she said, “New York is every ar-
tist’s Mecca.”
WORKED AT CARNEGIE

About six years ago, when the
market for pictures was practical-
ly nil, Miss Shirk decided to sup-
plement her income by doing li-
brary work. I This was only natur-
al, since she had always been in-
terested in books, both as an il-
lustrator and as an author.

After a few years at Carnegie
Library, she came to the Univer-
sity. Besides her regular duties
in the catalogue department, Miss
Shirk is now working on illustra-
tions for two history books to be
issued by the University press.

serious consideration. when it
comes to reckoning a cup-winner

apparently, that can win when

Corr developed Thompson into a

Traclcmen Travel Again;

Train For Butler Relays

Pitt’s traveling trackmen make¢
their second invasion of the mid-]
west, spending this week—end at‘

Indianapolis for the annual But-
ler relays. Last Saturday the no
longer-unhappy Panther track-
men spent at South Bend, where
a record-smashing Notre Dame
team swept up the Central Inter-
collegiates, leaving second place to
the visiting Pitt men.

There were some dozen schools
in the running, so second place was
a handy accomplishment. Despite
the Irish sweep‘ Olson saw his
team hit the.p_innacle of the In-
door season. Johnny Woodruﬁ
regained his Olympian form
(track form), Pete Bennet proved
himself in good physical condition,
the mile relay team won, all pres-
aging a big outdoor track season.

JOHNNY COMES UP

Striding Johnny Woodruff was
the individual high point man of
the Central meet. In winning the
880 and 4.40 Woodiuff had to rush
from behind in both races. Some
track experts were of the opinion
that once behind in a race Wood-
ruff was unable to win; Satur-
day’s performance did a little dis-
proving.

Ohl, Fe-rrara, and McKee picked

up a handy lead in the mile relay.
Again the baton was handed to
Woodruff. And again the mile

Butler relays. And from Olson’s
conversation the mid-west must
be crawling with crack track

Twelve fraternities are pitted
against each other for the
beautiful track trophy which
Mr. Corley guards in his office,
and also for additional points to-
ward the all point trophy which
has its inauguration this year.

Among the track events which
will be decided by the little stop

eight lap relay, and medley relay,

all to be raced against time.

The Delts will again pin their
hopes on Emil Naric and Fred
Herlinger to win them enough
points in the three relays to cinch
the meet for them.

PHI KAPS STRONG

Phi Kappa, third place winners
of last year, will have a strong
team at the field house with high
hopes of bringing the trophy to
Craig Street. Pat Cusick, the
hockey star, and Bonelli, Urban,

Phi Kappa conquered Pi Kappa
Alpha last Wednesday evening to
cinch the basketball championship

of league A with =ﬁve victories and
no defeats.

Last’night’s battle between Kap-
pa Sigma and Theta Chi decided
whether Kappa Sigma went unde-
feated for the fourth straight year
or whether league B was thrown
into a triple tie involving the
above two teams and the SAE.
The result of this game was not
known at press time.

Phi Kappa played good fast ball
throughout the season and their
only defeat was suffered in an out-
side league. Dandy Dick Cassiano,
Johnny Urban, and Herron were
the mainstays of the‘Crai_g street

Looks Forward

To John Carroll

By JIM DAILEY

Playoff dates for the eastern
division of the 13-0 collegiate
hockey league were announced
yesterday by Father Dietrich,
league representative.

The plans as announced call
for Pitt and Duquesne to play
off for the eastern title next
Monday and Tuesday, March 21
and 22, according to the ‘total goal
system. The total goals at the end
of the two game
series will be
added up to de-
clare the win-
ner in case the
teams win one
game apiece.

In the west-
ern division the
same procedure
will be fol- _‘ _
lowed. The op- Bnttam
ponents there will be John Carroll
and Western Reserve, and the
winners will play the eastern vic-
tor two games, one in Cleveland
and one in Pittsburgh.

Dates for the ﬁnal playoff are
as yet tentative, due to the com-
ing of the ice follies to Duquesne
Garden the week of March 28.

Tonight Pitt will more or less
go through the motions as they
play the hapless Fenn sextet in
the ﬁrst, game, scheduled at 8
o’clock at Duquesne Garden.
Fennhas, to date, lost nine games
and won only one, that being a
decision over Carnegie Tech.

NO LETDOWN

Pitt, meanwhile, will point for
John Carroll, hoping to take Fenn
in stride. However, Coach Mc-
Sorley stressed the fact in prac-
tice that anything can happen in
hockey and for the boys to watch
Fenn. When competition gets
mediocre there is a tendency for
a good team to let down with dis-
astrous results.

McSorley will spend all prac-
tice sessions this week perfecting
a defense for the John Carroll
who will play Pitt at Cleveland
Friday night and who are rated
the most powerful scoring team 
the league. Arsenault, spearhead
and left wing of the John Carroll
club, is as present leading both
leagues in scoring by a wide mar-
gin. 1
Coach Mcsorley began prepara-
tion for Friday night’s game with
the Carrollmen at last Monday’s
practice, giving specific instruc-
tions on how to stop high—scoring
Eddie Arsenault.

STOP ARSENAULT

“ ‘Tatey’ Brittain will be as-
signed to Arsenault,” said McSor-
ley, “with the idea of getting in
his hair from the start. We’ll ﬁnd
a way to stop him even if no one
else could.”

At the beginni.ng of the practice
session he singled Brittain out for
the following instructions:

“Tatey, I’m going to put it
straight up to you. When Arsen-
ault comes on the ice, you follow
him. When he goes off for a sub-
stitute, you go off too. Even if he
walks out in the lobby for a drink
of water you can follow him with
my blessing.”

“You’re getting this assignment
because you can skate better than
he can. The rest of you fellows
are to keep an eye on him too. If
he gets away from Brittain, body-
check instead of poke—check, he’s
tricky.”

It’s McSorley’s belief that if
Arsenault can be stopped so can
the Carrolls, and he’s willing to
give it a try.

Students Take
AviationExams

Entrance examinations will be
given students interested in a
course of army aviation instruction
during the" period of March 16-19
(today through Saturday) at Car-
negie Institute of Technology, ac-
cording to an announcement from
the military department.

To take the one-year course as
Flying Cadets, U. S. Army, which
includes pay and allowance while
enrolled, students must have as a
prerequisite two years of college
work.

Also required to take the en-
trance examinations, to be given
in the basement of Thistle Hall,
are three letters of recommenda-
tion and a transcript of grades.
Further information may be ob-
tained from Sergeant Peter L.
Duffy, assistant instructor in mil-

 

itary science, in 1101 Cathedral.

afternoon.

At 4 o’clock, with one hour re-

sisting at the tea table.

Commented Mrs. Miller, as she

Serving tea to the upperclass-
men were freshman women from

As Instructor

William O. Frabotta, '35, has
replaced Stephan J. Tracy, who
recently resigned his position of
instructor in mechanical engineer-
ing, according to an announce-
ment by E. A. Holbrook, dean of
the School of Engineering.

A graduate of the aeronautical
engineering course, Mr. Frabotta
received a three-months leave of
absence from the Ford Motor com-
pany in order that he might ac-
cept a temporary appointment
with the University.

A member of the faculty since
1930, Mr. Tracy left the Univer-
sity to accept the position of as-
sistant professor of mechanical
engineering at the College of the
City of New York.

Heckert Claims
Nazis Dominate  
European States

\Varning that America can-

from European conflicts, Rob-
ert Heckert, author and trav-

eler, speaking Monday at In-
quiry Forum, suggested that
this country initiate some form
of “international economic coop-
eration.”

“We should show the ‘have-
not’ nations that we are capable
of being generous. We should try
to understand the psychology of
their people, and to realize the
position in which those countries
ﬁnd themselves,” declared Mr.
Heckert.

AMERICANS WELL-OFF

Americans do not appreciate
the liberty and security of their
every-day living conditions, he
claimed. In all European nations,
even in England, people have a
constant fear of impending war.

“Let\ us not blind ourselves by
our government’s security and a
false sense of superiority,” warned
Mr. Heckert.

“In coming back to America
from Europe,” he said, “I have
never been so conscious that I am
an American as I have been re-
cently. When one returns from
Europe, he feels that a tremend-
ous load has been taken off his
mind.”

GERMANY WANTS PEACE

Recent events in central Eu-
rope, culminating in Hitler’s coup
against Austria, will not lead to
war immediately, in Mr. Heckert’s
opinion. He believes that Ger-
many is afraid to do anything
which will precipitate war, and
that the other nations of Europe
do not feel that they are prepared
to ﬁght Germany.

Every person is born with
healthy lungs.

t 

Many of us become infected
from other people as we grow
up.

 

The first infection usually
heals. The person is well and
no germs escape from his
lungs. It is important to ﬁnd
this first infection in children.

Tuberculosis Develops by Stages

Free tuberculin anti-tuberculosis tests are being offered
now at the student health services. These tests aid in the
discovery of cases of unsuspected tuberculosis.

 

It later a person becomes in-
fected again, the serious dis-
ease tuberculosis may begin.
The germs that escape from
the lungs are likely to infect
others.

 

If tuberculosis is not.dis-

covered early, the disease
spreads. A hole (cavity) may
form in the lung which is ‘an
incubator of germs that es-
cape and menace everybody
who co-mes in contact with the
sick pe_rson.

available to students than in pre-

the practice of eastern college

Cap and Gown is the only major
