Jason Gallinger
Assistant News Editor

Just in time for students to sign their
loan applications, University administra-
tion has announced that tuition will
increase again this fall.

Pitt trustees approved a four percent

tuition increase at their meeting last -

Thursday. The increase is part of an
$865.1 million budget for ﬁscal year
1999 that the full board will vote on
tomorrow.

If the proposal passes, the increase
will bring tuition for full-time resident

students enrolled in the College of Arts
and Sciences to $5,884 a year. Out-of-
state students in CAS will pay $12,918 a
year.

Both of those ﬁgures are basic
tuition without fees —— like student activ-

_ ities and computer fees — included. With

tuition and fees added together, in-state
residents will pay $6,164 and out—of-state
residents will pay $13,198.

This proposed tuition increase would
be the lowest in 10 years and the second
lowest in 25 years. Last year, Pitt
increased tuition by 4.5 percent.

Chancellor Mark Nordenberg attrib-

 
 
 
  
     

uted this year’s modest increase to sever-
al factors. For one, he said, the
University is committed to cost—effective
spending.

The state is also giving Pitt more
money. The Commonwealth appropriat-
ed more than $158 million to the
University this year.

These and other factors, Nordenberg
said, allow the University to keep tuition
increases to a “minimum” while invest-
ing “rather heavily in student life
enhancements” like proposed student
housing in South Oakland.

At the same time, the University’s

years

costs are rising. For instance, the
University will have to absorb 65 percent
of a $6 million increase in the cost of its
employees’ medical insurance coverage,
the budget committee said. The ‘tuition
increase is necessary to help offset the
rising costs.

Student Government Board presi-
dent Alyson Wallach said she needed to
meet with the board of directors to dis-
cuss the proposed increase before SGB
could formulate a “cohesive reaction.”

She said SGB has been aware for

Pitt grad first black Miss Pennsylvania

Frank Holland

For the Pitt News

Mayra Maria Acosta said
she realizes the importance of
being the first black Miss
Pennsylvania. But she makes it
clear that it is not what is most
important to her.

The 1998 Pitt graduate is
more concerned with fulfilling
her duties as Miss
Pennsylvania and hopefully
becoming Miss America at the
pageant in Atlantic City, N.J.
on Sep. 19.

“It is actually one of my
least favorite questions,” she
said, regarding her role as the
first black woman to win the
crown. “It would feel just as
wonderful if I were any other
racef’

Acosta was one of four
minority contestants in a field

of 24, but she added that “race
has nothing to do with it.”
“[Miss Pennsylvania] is a only

about the talent and caliber of

girls who participate,” she
said.

Acosta said she plans to
travel around the state to dis-
cuss her Miss Pennsylvania
platform —— cardiopulmonary
resuscitation education and
other current issues.

“Anywhere I am invited I
will go and speak,” she said.

She has already made sev-
eral well-received appearances,
including speaking at a
Pittsburgh area retirement
home. She met recently met
Sam Donaldson and is looking
forward to an upcoming meet-
ing with Governor Tom Ridge
and his wife.

Acosta’s win may be the
first time a black woman has

won in the pageant’s 64-year’
history, but it is not her first
time in the pageant. She fin-
ished in the top-10 in last
year’s contest, and participated
each year since the 1993-1994
pageant year, when she was a
high school senior.

Another notable first hap-
pened in this year’s pageant —
contestants were allowed to
wear bikinis. Acosta was one
of the eight top—ten finalists
who chose to do so.

“I just like bikinis better,”
she said.

Apparently, the judges
agreed. Acosta won the
Preliminary Swimsuit Award,
along with the Healthy Smile
award, for $200 and $300
respectively, in addition to the
$5000 scholarship for being’
Ms. Pennsylvania.

Campus news in Brief

Students warned
about telephone
scam

The Telecommunications office
has issued a warning to Pitt students
about a telephone scam that could
cost them money. '

According to Bruce Hutchison,
director of Telecommunications, no
students as yet have been victims as
of yet, and only one incidence of a
scam attempt has been recorded.

It happened last Thursday when
an operator at the University switch-
board received the call.

Hutchison said University oper-
ators are generally kept informed
about telephone scams known to be
happening around the country.

The operator, he said, was sus-
picious of the call and reported it to
the Telecommunications office,
which then informed Pitt police.

According to
Telecommunications, the scam
begins as an off—campus call.

The caller pretends to be an
employee of the telephone company
and asks questions about the quality
of campus telephone service,
Telecommunications said.

They said the caller then states
the company needs to perform a line
test, asking the victim to perform a
series of steps: hang up the phone,
pick it back up and wait for a dial
tone, then dial 9-1.

At that point, the scam artist
can break into the line and use it to
place a call to anywhere he wants,
according to Telecommunications.
This could result in costly long dis-
tance charges for the victim.

The message from
Telecommunications said the office
cannot trace the calls and that stu-
dents would be responsible for any
charges incurred.

The Telecommunications office
said that when it needs to enlist stu-
dents’ help to diagnose a line prob-
lem, it always calls from a campus
phone, it almost never needs an out-
side line and that it never needs a
student to dial 9-1.

Construction to
cause Forbes Ave.
headaches

Beginning Monday, June 22,
the south curb lane of Forbes
Avenue will be closed between
Coltart Street and McKee Place due

to the construction of the Wyndham
Hotel on the corner of Forbes and
McKee.

In order to keep the flow of
traffic moving through the two
remaining lanes, parking will be
prohibited on the north curb lane of
Forbes Avenue during afternoon
rush hour.

Also, due to the construction on
the sidewalk that will border the new
hotel, the west curb lane of McKee
Place, which is commonly used for
parking, will be closed between
Iroqouis and Forbes.

In addition, on Sunday, June
28, Forbes Avenue in Oakland will
be closed completely from 6 a.m.
until the end of the day to allow for
a crane lift. The ramps from
Boulevard of the Allies and the

‘Parkway will remain open, but once

on Forbes Avenue, cars will be
rerouted onto Halket Street and into
the Fifth Avenue bus lane.

I UPMC doctors
win awards

This month, several University
of Pittsburgh Medical Center doc-
tors have won national awards in the
areas of psychiatry, sports medicine
and orthopedic research.

Dr. Jasbir Kang received the
Annual Exemplary Psychiatrist
Award from the National Alliance
for the Mentally Ill. The award is
given to psychiatrists who further
public awareness, eliminate stigmas
or oppose discriminatory practices
related to mental illness.

Kang received the award at the
American Psychiatric Association’s
annual convention in Toronto on
June 3. He said it is important for
research to assist the mentally ill in
becoming integrated into society and
was thankful that his work has been
appreciated. ,

Dr. Kang is the medical director
of Mental Health Services for
UPMC Beaver Valley and an associ-
ate professor of clinical psychiatry
at Pitt’s school of medicine. He has
been invited to speak at numerous
other medical schools and profes-
sional conferences.

Dr. Scott Lephart won the
Kevin P. Speer new investigator
award from the National Athletic
Trainers Association (NATA). In
addition to the award, Lephart will
receive a medal, a $2,000 cash prize
and will speak about the key points
of his research at this year’s NATA
meeting.

TUITION

some time that tuition would likely rise.
SGB, she said, had been expecting an
increase of approximately 3.5 percent, ver-
sus the four percent armounced.

Wallach said the increase should not
be a problem.

“We [SGB] believe that tuition at Pitt
is rising at a similar rate as others in the
state,” she said.

Pitt officials were quick to point out
that many other universities charge higher
tuition. According to a chart provided by
the budget committee:

°With tuition and fees added together,
Pennsylvania residents would_ pay $21,373
a year to go to Carnegie Mellon University
next year, a 4.9 percent increase over last
year.

-Duquesne University will increase its
tuition by 4.5 percent next year, to
$14,699.

Syracuse University will hike tuition
next year to $18,865, an increase of 5.1
percent.

On the other hand, the same chart indi-
cated Pennsylvania residents could go to
Penn State for between $6,036 and $6,065.
That represents an increase of between 3.5
percent and 4 percent, depending on the
program a student is enrolled in.

And tuition next year at Indiana
University of Pennsylvania will be $4,184,
the same amount as last year.

Wallach said it is important to keep
Pitt’s tuition as low as possible so that
other schools don’t become a more attrac-

tive alternative.

“As the student government board, we
support trying to maintain as low of a
tuition cost as we can,” she said. ‘”That’s so
we don’t decrease the gap between public
and private schools, so students don’t
choose a private school over a public one
— i.e., Pitt.”

SGB’s concern is to keep Pitt’s tuition
low enough to prevent local competition
like CMU from becoming a viable altema—
tive to students for whom paying for col-
lege is a concern.

At this point, Wallach said, Pitt is suf-
ﬁciently competitive.

“Our education is a great value,” she
said. “We are getting a great education at
Pitt.”

Wallach added that students are will-

A SUITE FOR LESS

ing to tolerate moderate tuition increases.
She said SGB receives relatively few com-
plaints about rising tuition.

As further evidence, students ﬁrmly
supported the proposal to raise tuition to
pay for expanded U—zone privileges.

“Students were very supportive of
raising tuition for increased services,”
Wallach said.

She said SGB is more likely to hear
complaints about the financial aid process.
A lot of students, she said, are concerned
about receiving a financial aid package
that doesn’t meet their needs. I

When push comes to shove, Wallach
said students would rather not have to
think about tuition at all.

“The complaint is tuition period,” she
said.

6 OPINIONS

 
   

 an alien concept
for Southern Baptists

Some people are just too
unwilling to leave the past
behind.

This can be said of the
Southern Baptists, who said
recently at a conference in Salt
Lake City that women should
“submit graciously” to their hus-
bands’ leadership. ‘

The new 18th Article of the
Baptist Faith and Message is a
gross insult to every woman,
and a spit in the face of all that’s
been done in the past to attain
equality between men and
women.

To say that a woman’s gra-
cious submission to a man is the

. same as a church’s willing sub-

mission to Christ is stupid and
archaic. Even the ambiguous
adverb “graciously” doesn’t
mask the nature of this state-
ment, which is basically the
same as condoning the cartoon

image of a caveman dragging a ,

woman by her hair. Marriage is
a union in which both husband
and wife should be equal, with
shared responsibility in all
affairs.

The Southern Baptists justi-
fy their barbaric rhetoric by
pointing to the Bible and saying
it is God’s word, and that it
should be followed to the letter.

Need we mention that some of
the worst atrocities of the past
two rnillennia, such as the anni-
hilation of "most of South
America’s native population,
apartheid, the Spanish
Inquisition and slavery, were
“justified” by lunatic pastors
who pointed to selected verses
in the Bible?

With the Christian right-
wing gaining more and more
inﬂuence in the Republican
Party, the danger lies in such
reactionary hokum becoming
law. History shows that ridicu-
lous and dangerous ideas can
become law — look no further
than Nazi Germany.

The motivation behind the
Southern Baptists’ statement lies
in their attempt to “restore fami-
ly va1ues.” By using the Bible as
a crutch and believing that the
cure lies in having women be
subservient to men in the institu-
tion of marriage (the same Bible
verse was used to justify sub-
servience to men in all institu-
tions in the past), they’re setting
a dangerous precedent that will
inevitably spill over into other
areas in society.

Equality should not be
something absent from a mat-
riage.

Church undermines social

In a 1981 encyclical, Pope John Paul II
wrote the following words: “In order to achieve
social justice in the various parts of the world,
in the various countries, and in the relationships
between them, there is a need for new move-
ments of solidarity of the workers and with the
workers.” It is possible to ﬁnd places in the
United States where followers of this self-pro-
claimed “infallible” man do not heed his above-
cited teachings. One need go no further than the
South Side of Pittsburgh.

The St. Paul of the Cross Personal Care
Home is run by the neighboring monastery of
the same name. Seven weeks ago, workers at
the facility represented by United Food and
Commercial Workers (UFCW),
Local 23, made the decision to go on
stlike. They include nurses’ aides,
cooks, housekeeping and. mainte-
nance workers. Most of them make
minimum wage, some of them even
after years of experience. They are considered
“part-time,” even though they are often forced
to work full-time hours, so they get no medical
coverage. The list of grievances goes on,
although it is far too long to do it justice here.

I have paid several visits to the picket line
bearing doughnuts, cookies, and general soli-
darity. I have no illusions that this has helped
very much, aside from the fact that strikers
almost always appreciate sympathetic visitors,
especially those who bring food. In any event,
they are not the uncaring monsters who are
often portrayed in management propaganda and
the mass media when health care workers go on
strike. They have worked every day with the
home’s residents and they have genuine con-
cern for the residents’ well-being. They have no
objection to family members entering the build-
ing to visit their relatives, and they most deﬁ-
nitely have no quarrel with workers who make
deliveries of essential supplies, like oxygen.
But they have a very different auitude toward
those the home has hired to do their jobs.

For years, the right wing has been railing
against “political correctness,” an alleged ten-
dency towards stalinization of the language on
the part of English Department leftists. Far
more dangerous, though, are the shibboleths of
mainstream discourse. My pick for the most
atmoying is the euphemistic appellation
“replacement worker.” In more honest days,
such individuals were referred to by the much
more appropriate term “scab.” This is no longer

There is very little that the St. Paul Manor
strikers can do to stop the scabs, either. The sup-
posedly pro-labor Catholic Church has hired
uniformed “security guards” (i.e. scab-herders)
at roughly twice the pay of their striking
employees for the purposes of holding down
the wages and beneﬁts of those same employ-
ees. (Incidentally, the guards are from the noto-
rious Pinkerton agency; some things never
change.) The home’s actions are perfectly legal,
of course; there is no secret about whose side
the government is on in labor conﬂicts.

After last year’s Teamsters strike at UPS,
anti-labor Congressmen held hearings to
denounce alleged “picket-line vio-
lence” by striking workers. The
hypocrisy.:--is;--‘almost breathtaking.
Politicians who promote the NRA
position on handguns and assault
riﬂes —- ostensibly so citizens can
defend their persons and homes against attack
or theft — are the same politicians who cry foul
the minute workers use the slightest hint of
physical persuasion to keep scabs from stealing
their jobs.

For the St. Paul of the Cross workers, all of
this has been a tremendous obstacle to achiev-
ing justice. The most they can do is cast asper-
sions on the personal honor of the scabs them-
selves, but honor is something that scabs noto-
riously lack, so such appeals have so far proven
ineffective. Also, after an admittedly rational
cost-beneﬁt analysis, the workers have deter-
mined that unlike the pioneers of the labor
movement, they are not yet willing to risk arrest
to defend their livelihood.

In the meantime, the dispute drags on with
no sign on the part of management of any will-
ingness to negotiate with the union. Anyone
who cares about justice for workers should pay
a visit to the picket line. If you’re in Oakland,
all you need to do is take the 54C bus to 18th
Street and Monastery, then walk a mere block
or so up the hill. The less intrepid may want to
write a letter of protest, or if you prefer, just clip
and mail this article to St. Paul of the Cross
Personal Care Home, 148 Monastery Ave.,
Pittsburgh, PA 15203-1498, perhaps advising
them to read the papal Encyclical Laborem
Exercens.

Marys and an Our Father for this one.

Finally, a summer movie
where the special effects aren't the
main attraction —— even if they
appear in almost every minute of

e movie.

The whole point of the special
effects in Dr. Dolittle was to look
real, to go unnoticed in the overall
production. All of the animals in
the movie talk with very emotion-
al expressions, just like the dog
in the popular Taco Bell com
mercials.

The plot is sim le. Dr.
Dolittle (Eddie Murp y) had
the perfect life: a good career,
a happy family, and a promis-
ing ture. Then, the talent he had
as a boy reappeared —— he can talk
to and understand animals. His
perfect life slowly spins down-
wards and out of control as ani-
mals ﬂock to him. '

What makes the movie great is

that his character initially is not
fond of animals either. In order to
make sure that the filming would
go well, Murphy had to be intro-
duced to many of the animals
weeks earlier. Then, during pro-

talking to props that marked

By Zachariah Blott

In a culture where multinational
corporations sing the praises of the
”indie” aesthetic, Ani DiFranco has
created .a truly provocative means
of producing music on her own
terms and getting it to listeners.

And listeners will get a ﬁrst-
hand dose of the Ani experience this
Saturday, when she hits the I.C.
Light Amphitheatre in the midst of
a national tour promoting her
newest album, Little Plastic Castles.

DiFranco has broken just about
every rule of the music industry
over the years, blending folk guitar-
work with spoken word lyrics and a
hint of hard-rock an st. In the
process, she's paved e way for
other artists. V

The intimacy and hand-to-
mouth economics of the folk tradi-
tion fueled DiFranco’s passion for
live performance, and she sang and
played acoustic guitar in Rust Belt
bars before she was 10 years old.

DiFranco’s original composi-
tions cover many walks of musical
life —— rock, gospel and folk, for

example. Her lyrics are as plain-
spoken as they were poetic. She
wrote about the world around her.
Borrowing mone from friends
to cover the costs o incorporation
and studio time, she produced her
own self-titled debut album and
sold it from the trunk of her hand-

painted car while blazing a path
across the college campuses and
seedy dives of America.

Since then, she's formed her
own record company and attracted
attention from several big—time pro-
duction companies.

There is no single sound or song
that encapsulates the range of
DiFranco’s craft, but thinking of her
as the crossroads between folk and
pop rock won't get you lost. During

er career, she as performed solo
' with accompanying bass
and drums and on one
memorable occasion with
the Buffalo Philharmonic.
In the studio, she has
employed horn sections,
gospel singers, samples
and answering machine recordings.
She has released spoken word
tracks, dance remixes and a double-
live album.

The only constants in
DiFranco's world are her commit-
ment to writing and performing
intensely personal songs and her
insistence on doing things her own
way.

Youth and experience found in albums

Pure Sugar
Pure Sugar
Geffen

You can call this a pretty cool effort for a
dance trio. Dance groups can be either face-
less (Inner City), or they can be cartoonish
(Ru Paul), but in this case, there is a face
behind the beats.

Pure Sugar’s mainstays are remixers/ D]s
Pete Lorimer, Richard ”Humpty” Vision and
singer Iennifer Starr. For all intents and pur-
poses, most eyes are on the pink-clad blonde

ombshell V Starr (imagine Lisa Kudrow
fronting Deee-Lite and not The Lady Miss
Kier).

Starr's sultry vocals mesh with the boun-
tiful beats and samples conjured up by
Vission and Lorimer. It's a hard thing when
you consider the producer's beats over-
whelm the vocals. In this case, thou h,
Starr's Vocals blend with the beats and tie
live musicianship on the album.

With all of that under their belt, is it safe

' to call Pure Sugar pop? Only if it's hard and

lean and sexy. Pure Sugars CD is sultry
dance pop that is indeed ard, lean and sex .
It's the kind of CD that will undoubted y
have you dancing. The songs that deserve
your attention are ”These Are The Times”,
”The Feelin’ 98", "Hands To Heaven”, ”Hold

Giant/ Warner Brothers

They say that great artists
suffer for their work. Brian
Wilson may be a gerfect exam-
ple. We all know t e legenda
work he did with the Beac
Boys and their summer sounds.

We also know about his leg-
endary ups (Pet Sounds and the
brilliantly bittersweet documen-
tary I Iust Wasn't Made For These
Times) and downs (the drug- .
induced mental breakdowns and estrange-
ment from the Beach Bo s).

We now know that he's a survivor, and
that's a hard thing to be in the days of rock-
induced drug cases.

Wilson is now the only surviving brother
of the Beach Boys with his younger brother
Carl's passing (cancer), and his first solo
album since 1988's self-titled effort proves
that if you still have the talent, you will go a
long way.

Aided and abetted b the likes of Iimmy

Wilson is still the undisputed guru of pop.
He may have went through hell in his ife,

The Doomsday Kiss
l By Robert Davis
Horizon Press

By JENNIFER MAYNARD

The threat of biological agents

like anthrax or the outbreak of

‘viruses such as HIV and Ebola is

l not very far-fetched in the world
today.

AIDS continues to claim lives

worldwide. The evening news car-

ries stories about wackos trying to
wipe out New York City with
anthrax while cult members in
Japan release biological weapons
on subways. ‘

These contemporary events
} make it seem possible that a new
biological threat could emerge. In
his new book, ”The Doomsday
Kiss,” Robert Davis plays on these
, contemporary fears to create a
; thriller that deals with just such a
5 threat.

”The Doomsday Kiss” is dis-
appointing. Besides the weak char-
acters and technical drivel, the plot
I itself gets boring, dragging toward

the end. At nearly 400 pages, it’ s
~ almost too much to take.

The hero of the book, Dr. Alex
Seacourt, is sent to Las Vegas to
track down new anti-terrorist soft-
ware known as LAV-10. Frustrated
when his search seems fruitless,
Seacourt happens into a casino
where he witnesses a couple ush-

» ering a man through the lobby. The

Tl-IE Prrr News 11

man is in need of obvious medical
attention, but the couple won't let
Seacourt near him. The doctor
thinks he's seen the last of the man
until his body shows up on the
autopsy table, dead due to circum-
stances that Seacourt has never
seen the likes of before.

Little does Seacourt know that
the man was a victim of LAV-10,
which is not software but a deadly
biological agent capable of
destroying human life.

Seacourt has unwittingly been
thrown into the middle of an ”X-
Files”-style government conspira-
cy involving LAV-10. Now he
must run from unknown govern-
ment assassins while trying to
unravel the mystery of LAV-10.
The trail leads him to a sexy stunt
pilot, a lesbian prostitute, a famous
televangelist and of course, the
White House.

While all of this may sound
exciting, ”The Doomsday Kiss”
falls short of extraordinary. The
problems with the book begin with
the mind-numbing technical detail
Davis goes into throughout the
book. This jargon makes reading
annoying, and the dialogue
sounds unnatural.

The characters are another
weak point in the book. The main
character, Alex Seacourt, lacks per-
sonality to the point of being irri-
tatingly boring. The only spark of
life that Davis gives him is a whiny
obsession with his hair loss.

The other characters in the
book don't fare much better. Most
of them are corny at best, and read
like stereotypes, including a
tomboy pilot who slams Jack
Daniels and doesn't take crap from
anyone. The characters aren't even
interesting enough to make the
reader care what happens to them
in the end.

Other problems include horri-
bly corny sex scenes Davis should
have just left out, and a predictable
subplot dealing with parent-child
relationships.

If you're a fan of Davis’ earlier
books, such as ”The Plutonium
Murders,” then you may enjoy this
latest adventure. For everyone
else, ”The Doomsday Kiss” is not
worth the time and energy it takes
to trudge through it.

Bucs not that
a bad this year

It takes a lot of loyalty and devotion
to be a Pirates’ fan. V

Anyone can sit there and root for a
team like the Braves, but the stress and
frustration of. sitting through the Pirates’
season thus far has been an unwelcome
annoyance.

It’s not that the Pirates are doing that
badly. As far as records, they are on pace
to ﬁnish at or above last year’s mark. But
their division is just that much better.
Currently, their record is good enough for
ﬁfth place. Last year, that would have put
them in a close second.

If you want to complain, you can
consider a number of things. Pitching was
supposed to be solid, but we have seen a
number of strong performers who at ﬁrst
only suﬂered from occasional lack of run
support, but are now just plain suffering.
Jason Schmidt and Fransico Cordova
have sputtered recently.

Cordova was yanked after yielding
four straight walks and four runs in four
innings on Monday. His -ERA dropped
nearly half a point. Esteban Loaiza was
demoted to the bullpen and then brought
up again after the other solid starter Jose
Silva fractured his arm last week. Rich
Loiselle, the closing machine from last
year, has turned into Rich Loiselle the
blown save-machine. He played a major
role in blowing the 7 to 1 lead the Pirates
had in the ninth inning against the
Phillies.

In the wake of all this, you could
look at the nm support, which, although
was an early concern, has surprised us in
several cases.

This past weekend, Jason Kendall
led the league in batting, along with con-
sistency from Jose Guillen and Jermaine
Allensworth. Kevin Young leads the team
with 16 home runs and 47 RBIs, the most
for a f1rst—half season since the Bonds
days.

This, unfortunately, is where the list
ends. These guys are great at getting on
base, but then you have the other group of
batters, led by Al Martin, who ruin all the
fun and strike out with the bases loaded.

The Pirates love to leave runners
stranded. For some, I think it’s a hobby.
Monday night they had the bases loaded
twice, once with no outs and the other
time with one out. They got one whole
run out of it and left ll men on. If they
had one more solid bat to cushion the
lineup, they could produce more runs.

Traci Waites (center) brings energylfrom Arizona  h first h-mg job with the Lady Panthers.

In VNOZIHV JO A.|.lSH3/\lNf'] AS31303

Waites takes on biggest
challenge thus far at Pitt

Joe Carmody
Staff Writer

The road to recovery for the Lady
Panther basketball team gets underway
with the addition of Head Coach Traci
Waites.

In the basketball business, the top
performers are the ones who never let
their guard down. Each challenge they
face is followed by another obstacle to
overcome. This ongoing process sepa-
rates the best from the rest.

Last spring,
Panthers announced Traci Waites as
their new head coach, they took a big
step in removing themselves from the
rest. And from the activity that’s been
reported at the Fitzgerald Fieldhouse,
the Lady Panthers don’t appear to be
slowing down anytime soon.

“If this summer is an indication of
next season, then we’re on the right
track,” Waites said last week.

Waites knows what it takes to be
suCi;esst'ul. and sheknows how strong
yeur commitment must be to play with

when the Lady I

was the only player to appear in the
NCAA Final Four for two different
teams (the University of Georgia and
at Long Beach State). Plus, she’s led
every team she’s been a part of to the
highest level of competition.

Waites’ biggest concern for her
new team doesn’t revolve around win-
ning or losing. She wants her players
to learn that every time they take the
ﬂoor “we’re gonna compete.”

“I want to internally build—up one
player at a time,” Waites said. V

The philosophy she wants to share
with her players is that how they work
at basketball is a direct reflection of
their everyday lives.

“The combination of the commu-
nity, class room, families and team-
mates is what makes the basketball
player,” said Waites.

Waites credits her assistant coach-
es for being the backbone of the pro-
gram. Jennifer Britton and Bill
Broderick have a total of 17 years of
coaching experience. Waites feels
she’s lucky to have these hard workers
in her pi‘0gi‘am.

“I am where I am because of good

So how did Pittsburgh find such a
good person? Let’s just say it was the
right situation for both parties.

“Pittsburgh fit in my
Waites said with a slight smile.

Waites said her reason for becom-
ing a coach is to teach and give back
the knowledge she’s experienced. She
described working with players as the
same way you mold a ball of clay.

“I get an opportunity to learn about
people and find out what motivates
them,” she said. “It’s an incredible
thing to learn who people are and what
makes them click.”

Waites knows that winning doesn’t
come easy, and that the process here in
Pittsburgh starts from the bottom up.
She wants the Lady Panthers to play
for respect.

“I want to earn what we get
because we’re working for it, for the
pride that develops through dediear

sive performances have been great. Young

sion  WWF style. The World Wrestling
Federation’s annual “King of the Ring”
show will take over the Civic Arena on
Sunday night, and be broadcast to millions
all over the world via pay-per-view.

The main event will see WWF
Champion Stone Cold Steve Austin take
on the seven-foot monster Kane in a “ﬁrst
blood” match. Austin has become the
world’s most popular wrestler since cap-
turing the gold at WrestleMania XIV in
March, and has been on a roll ever since.

‘ “But he. hasn’t wrestled Kane yet,”
said Kane’s blubbery manager, Paul
Bearer, who also claims he is the evil chal-
lenger’s father. “Kane’s going to beat him.
He’s going to be the WWF Champion.”

Whether or not we’1l witness the
crowning of a new champion, the match
should be intriguing. Kane and Austin are
two of the most successful and high pro-
ﬁle superstars in the WWF, but their dis-
positions are about as opposite as you can
get.

Austin is no-bullshit and in~your-
face. His mix of colorful, humorous lan-
guage, absolute love for the microphone

and in-ring athleticism have made him
such a fan favorite.

But the Kane character spoke (with
his computer-assisted voice box) for the
ﬁrst time two just nights ago on WWF
“RAW.” He is a dark and ruthless phenom
who wrestles with pure power and very
little glitter. ,

The match is not a standard win by
pinfall contest. Instead, this “ﬁrst blood”
match will be decided by the man who
makes his opponent bleed ﬁrst. F

To make things even more interest-
ing, Kane has vowed to light himself on
ﬁre if he loses. But Kane is no stranger to
ﬂames. He recently‘ got set on ﬁre in an
“infemo match,” which he lost to the
Undertaker. . ' '

Speaking of the Undertaker, the for-
mer WWF champion will wrestle
Mankind, a deranged lunatic who doubles
as Cactus Jack and Dude Love, in a “Hell
in a Ce ” bout.

During‘ the match, the two legends
will battle it out within the conﬁnes of a
giant cell, made of chain-link fence, which
surrounds the ring. V

This is guaranteed to be an all—out
blood bath. Mankind is one of the most
famous hard-core wrestlers in history. He
once had his ear ripped off in a match (for

I3

real), but continued to wrestle. As Cactus
Jack, he’s participated in such gruesome
contests as barbed-wire matches and
explosion matches.

The event will also feature the semi-
ﬁnals and ﬁnals of the “King of the Ring”
tournament. The elimination tournament

I began with sixteen wrestlers, but is down

to the ﬁnal four after the ﬁrst two rounds
were contested on RAW.
The semis will feature two matches
as former Ultimate Fighting Champion
Ken Shamrock battles Jeff “Double J”
Jarrett and Intercontinental Champion
‘ “The Rock” Rocky Maivia takes on
another UFC legend, Dan Severn. Then
the winners of those two matches will face

. each other to see who will be crowned

King.

Other matches include Tag Team
Champions the New Age Outlaws versus
the Legion of Doom and Al Snow and
“ ead” (a mannequin head) against Bryan
Christopher and Scott Taylor.

Also, rumor has it that Sable, every-
one’s favorite blond, busty beauty, will be
involved in the main event.

There are still a few tickets remain-
ing, or the event can be ordered on pay-

per-view for $29.95 (call l-800-597- ,

7789).

Team USA makes n early exit fr

Tony Dremsizov
For The Pitt News

Team USA was kicked out of the
World Cup in the worst possible way. It
lost 1-2 to Iran in a game in which
much more than soccer was at stake.

Now USA has a 0-2-0 record an
stays at the bottom of its group; eve 
win in the third round again"

 

Yugoslavia will not help it to escape 

knock-out phase.

After hitting the crossbar and the
posts three times, the Americans and
coach Steve Sampson were left speak-
ing agonizingly about bad luck. But
that is only a reason for not scoring in

 
 

ught  the pitch. That

he""i')e ' "

header over Cas ‘

     
 
 
   
  

 

  
 

one opportunity and not a good expla-
nation for an embarrassing loss.
Although the World Cup is all
about sports,‘ right after the group draw.
was held last December everybody
knew there would be one game which
could turn political: USA vs. Iran on
June 21. After two decades of diplo-.
matic strife because of the hostage CI'1-
sis, this match was a good chance to
make points on the political scoresheet.
Naturally, no one admitted it, but still
accused the opponent of trying to do -- _
so, crossbar with _.
For a whole week, long before the Reyna’s long r "
game, the media in the USA  all the post Four 0'
over the world had constantlyitl
repeating that no political meaning

 
  

ing. Coach Sampson said  was proud
of his boys’ behavior agairffst Iran, but

‘e poor showing in France

he World Cup

did not contribute to many more youths
going to the soccer pitches. .

Elsewhere at the World Cup, the
favorites and the hooligans were neatly
doing their job. With a second victory,
Brazil, France, Argentina, Croatia,
Nigeria and Romania each stormed into
the second stage. , Italy and the
Netherlands struck back after first-
round stumbles.

Germany miraculously came back
from the dead to salvage the game with
Yugoslavia, ending 2-2 after trailing 0-
2. Of all the pre-toumament favorites,
only Spain lies at the bottom of its
group after drawing 0-0 with Paraguay
- but then, the Spaniards have always
been coming to the World Cups with
great expectations and have always fin-
ished in oblivion. I
