Parties For Rushees

Ix

Three Days Set Aside For‘
R-ushing By Panhellenic
Women This Week

 

Sailor parties, kid parties, formal
banquets, and even breakfasts are on
the-schedule for fraternity women
and eligible freshmen and upperclass
women this week. I

There are only three more days
for fraternities to complete their
plans before the ﬁrst affair takes
place Thursday evening. Each fra-
ternity is permitted, according to
Panhellenic Council rules, to register
three affairs during the open days,
Thursday and Friday.

Thursday’s party hours are from
5:30 to 9:30 o’clock, and those of
Friday are from 12:30 to 2:40
o’clock, and again from 5 to 9:30
o’clock. For these affairs, blanket
invitations are extended. .

Two Saturday Parties

The third day, Saturday, has been
set aside for only two events, ‘instead
of the three scheduled in former
years. Feeling that both fraternity
women and rushees were too hurried
to enjoy the season, and too busy to
receive any beneﬁt from it, when
there were three ‘Saturday ‘ parties.
Panhellenic Council this year has
abolished the afternoon affair. Thus,
invitations which will be issued in
person Friday to rushees ‘willbe for
only two Saturday parties.

The morning event continues from
10 to 2 o’clock, and the evening from
5 o’clock until midnight. After each
affair, the fraternities are allowed an
extension of one-half hour to take the -
rushees home.. _ _

Silence week, during which frater—j
nity women_sp_eak to rushees only in
passing and carry on no conversation.
with them, begins at 12:30 o’clock,
immediately after the midnight party"
Saturday, and lasts until the next-
Saturday at noon. '

Bids Due Tuesday

According to Frances Calhoun, Ed‘
37, chairman of rushing rules, this
silence is maintained to give the rush-
ees an opportunity for calm deliber-
ation on the subject of pledging after
the hectic three-day session of rush-
ing, which although it may be served
to help the rushee make her ﬁnal de-
cision, is nevertheless not conducive
to any coherentthought on the im--
portant subject of whether or not to
pledge, and if so, which fraternity
to pledge.

On Tuesday morning, however, the
fraternities must hand in.all bid lists
to Heinz House, and each girl receiv-
ing a bid will be sent the official bal-
lot on which to mark the group of
her choice. Rushees must return
their ballots to Heinz House by 9:30
o’clock Friday, March 12, and fra-
ternities may call for their accept-
ance lists at Heinz House at five
o’clock that afternoon.

Presides At Meeting

Dr. J. S. Taylor, professor of
mathematics, presided ,at a meeting
of the mathematics section of "the
Pennsylvania State Education Asso-
ciation, held Saturday in the Indus-
tries Building at Carnegie Institute
of Technology. T. R. Leaman, in-
structor in mathematics at the Uni-
versity and head of the executive
committee, also attended the meeting.

Allen, Benny, French
"Unit Feud Over. ‘Bee’

Just like Fred Allen and Jack
Benny, the members of the French
.Unit entertained each other at
their regular Friday meeting by
having a “bee” (spelling). In-
stead of the usual speeches, read-
ings, etc.,‘these fresh-man women
tried to outspell each other.

The unit was divided into two
equal teams, with Ruth McHenry
calling out the words. Such words
as “echafaud,” “trombler,” “gen-~
darme,” and “femme” proved
themselves stumbling blocks to
these erstwhile French linguists.
When the class bell adjourned the
“bee,” the teams were still evenly
numbered.

Footballers
‘ Score i‘H'i*t9

College Association's a n n u a 1
mid-winter informal, the Campus
Beauty Prom, scored a hit with
300 couples attending, by "intro-
ducing an all-male ﬂoor show last
Friday night in the main ballroom
‘of Hotel Schenley.

With Charles Rogers, C37, as
master of ceremonies, four mem-
bers -of the varsity football» team.
displayed real talent in their new
roles.

The Don Hensley-George Delich
“swing” duo scored a distinct hit in
its first public appearance with a
novel interpretation of a dance
from a Lenox Avenue black-and-A
tan spot.”

Arnold Greene, husky fullback,
wrapped himself about a guitar,
and gave a professional version of
“Rozetta” and one other number.

Curley Stebbins, crooning half-
back, made his second CA appear-
ance, a demand return after scor-
ing at the College Assembly in‘
January.

Emcee Rogers revealed that
Jean Lawson, C37, had been se-
lected beauty queen by the Col-
lege Association Cabinet.

The selection was made on the
basis of poise, charm, beauty,
form, social ease, ‘and other re-
quirements representing the high-
est qualities of beauty in Univer-
sity women.

McKay Cites
Three-Fold  
Strike Loss

 

AProfessor "Declares Strike

Legalization Ends Rigid
Control Of Industry

By Clarence B. Wible

Now that the" West Coast shipping
strike ‘and the General Motors trou-
ble has been settled, student opinion
is rife concerning the "economic,
legal, and general aspects of the
strike as a means of settling labor
trouble.

Dr. M. K. McKay, professor of
economics, when questioned, had this
to say about strikes in general:

“The strike is recognized by all
authorities to be a very effective
weapon of labor for securing their
demands. An-d despite popular opin-
ion, the right to strike is recognized
as legal. The legalization of strikes
sounded the death-knell of rigid con-
trol of industry by the capitalists.”

The strike, in its m-ore malignant
form, according to Dr. McKay, was
illustrated by the recent shipping
strike on the West Coast which held
up theshipment of goods f-or more
than three months. This strike made
apparent, as did the General Motors
strike to a lesser degree, the fact that
there is always a three-fold loss in-
volved—-the loss to labor‘, to industry,
and the consumer. W

“The results of the General Motors
strike,” Dr. McKay states “indicates
that all parties gained, including the
consumer. This strike was unusual in
that a fine spirit of co-operation was
shown by both sides. There was lit-
tle violence, and much" serious -and
well-planned arbitration.” .

To the public-' at large, the so-
called “sit-d-own strike” is a new and
interesting device in capital-labor dis-
putes. It has been lauded as the most
peaceable and efficient method "of
striking that has ever been evolved.
Dr. McKay, however, does not take
the sit-down strike very seriously.

“The sit-down strike will never
hold a very important place in the
settlement of labor disputes, for
they will not last. They are new to
the United States and will be corre-
spondingly popular until the novelty
wears off. They originated, by the
way, in France and not in the States

as popularly supposed.”

ployees, the Research Bureau for Re-
tail Training opens its Spring insti-
tute term tomorrow night.

The classes, made possible by the
Bureau with the cooperation of nine
downtown stores, will be held at
Kaufmann’s Auditorium on Tuesday
evenings from March 2 to March 30.

“Current Factors in Retailing,” a
class which will emphasize important
trends in local and national business,

will have as ‘his subject, “Trends in
Federal Legislation Affecting Retail-
ers.” Leading the third meeting will

‘Manners In Business’

Miss Edith Jamieson, instructor in
salesmanship and textiles at the Re-
search Bureau, offers a course it
“Manners in Business.” This course
will deal with deﬁnite standards of
behavior which have been accepted
for the business world standards
which differ from-the etiquette of so-
cial life. _- I »

“What is" the science of psychol-
ogy?” and “How can the ﬁndings of

day problems of human behavior?”
are the questions forming a basis of
a course in “Applied Psychology,”
which will be taught by D1‘. Carroll
Whitmer. Dr. Whitmer is associate
professor of psychology at the Uni-
versity. ' - , ‘
Selling ‘Good Taste’

Elements of good taste and their
application ‘to the selection and selling
of merchandise in department stores
will bestudied in “Good Taste and
How To Sell It.” The class will be

sistant professor of industrial design
at Carnegie Institute of Technology.
. “Modern Display” will include -a
study of. color, color harmonies and
design as applied to display of items
in windows, showcases, counters and
tables. Miss Bernice Gertrude Cham-
bers, instructor i_n fashion and dis-
play at the Research Bureau, will con-
duct the class. 5

date the crowds. And so the chair-
man and his committee decided -to
make their aﬁair not only the grand-
est and most elaborate of the tradi-
tional dances, but also to ‘make it an
exclusive one. I

Accordingly, invitations were is-
sued to students -in the-military de-
partment, and each man was ‘given
permission to request one guest
ticket. These guests were required
to purchase their tickets the week
before the dance or the invitations
would no't be redeemable.

Then to add to the attraction of
the evening the ROTC men signed up
their home town's most promising
loca.l orchestra, Charles Pallos, to
play in the other ballroom of the
beautiful William Penn Hotel.

And since all of this cost only
three "dollars, the students _all_ went
home happy. 2

«ma   Bill’
Pioneer

‘ _ By’ Clarence Wiblo
“Prof. Bill” Arther ﬂexed his mus-
cles, glanced earnestly, around the
room, braced himself before" his Ad-
vertising 22 class, and issued this
bombshell: ‘ I
,“I am the one who started Powell
Crosley of WLW on the road to
fame and fortune." ' i
The class, with usual decorum, re-
sponded nobly. “Tell us a story,
Uncle Bill. Tell us‘a.story.”
“Prof.” Arther smiled apprecia-
tively, ﬁngered his stiff _whi'te collar
and blue tie, and obliged with this
astonishing and little-known story of
radio pioneering.
I “Dear students, it was like this.
Way back in the lean ‘winter '_of
1922, two other gentlemen and'I
received an inspiration from above.
Radio was then in theodiaper stage
-——why shouldn't we take fate in
our capable hands ‘and scoop the
city _with the ﬁrsht complete radio
show? And, "students. that's pre-
cisely what we did.” I
And then he told how they had
contracted the William Penn Hotel
for the seventeenth ﬂoor, and invited
25 companies to display radio parts,
including young Powell Crosley. The
radio hook-up was completed from
East Pittsburgh to the hotel.

was jammed. Every policeman .in
town was at the hotel to accommo-
date the huge crowd that had gath-
ered. The manager of the hotel
was in a frenzy of despair.
guests had been forced to use the

rooms. Students, it was colossal!"

At 8:15 sharp, the show started-—
the ﬁrst radio broadcast over West-
inghouse station KDKA. Music from
East Pittsburgh was miraculously
heard through a box-like contraption
resting on a table in the downt-own
hotel. Most of the listeners were
very skeptical. Only Crosley of Cin-
cinnati was convinced. He took up
the idea seriously,
pioneering radio station.-of WLW is
the result.

After the broadcast, the various
displays were examined. Each of the
25 companies had paid from $25 to
$50 for permission to display their
parts.

Crosley, or the Story of the First

Then all hell broke ‘loose. Wild
,cheers'_were ‘heard. Our professor
was a pioneer just like Wild Bill
Hickockf Touched to the heart by
this -warm, sincere demonstration,
“Prof. Bill” Arther, again with an
earnest and reminiscent look in his
eyes, started out anew. '

“Students, have I ever told you,
that I was the first man ever to’
broadcast a football game over the
radio? Well, it's a fact. You see
it was like this

Boxers Defeat
Owls As Pitt,
Loses On Mat

Panther boxers and wrestlers broke
even in their week-end invasion» of.
Philadelphia Saturday night. Tem-
ple’s wrestlers proved too good for
Coach Ed Mazeski’s fa1te;rin'g- inat-
men. but Pitt’s boxers 1-ang"“up, their
second win of. the season,  their-'
second in a row. A‘

The boxing victory, placing Pitt in
a tie with Bucknell for the league:
lead, cannot be attributed‘ entirely to-
Pitt power. The truth is, that of six
matches actually taught, the Pan-
thers won only two and drew" one,
while Temple waswinning three.

Owls Donate Two

Only the fact; that the. Owls. had.
to forfeit fights in the barrtanrweiglu
and welterweight divisions gave Pitt
the match.

Outstanding bouts were the feath-
erweight and heavyweight battles.
Ralph Caruso, doughty Panther‘ 125-
pounder, was defeated by -Owl Lou.‘-
Rubenstein in an exciting thi:'e'e‘-round

match which went the limit after..the’ -

game Panther boxer had’ bit the can-
vas for a count in the second round.
Halley Wins By K. 0.

Less fortunate .were.~. the Templars
in the heavyweightﬁght.. Emil Hal-
ley, Panther heavyweigliit. whipped
right into Temple’s- Bill -Davidson, a
Mt. Lebanon boy who runs Pop Wari-
ner’s football team from a quarter-.
back position, and punished him so-
badly that the referee stopped the
ﬁght before the ﬁrst round bell. The

total match score was Pitt‘ 41/.2, 'I‘.em_-I. .0

ple 3%.
Wrestlers End Card -

Also forfeiting two matches, the
Panther wrestlers still did better than
at any time this season, although they
lost, 28-6. Rudy Tomarelli in the
125-pound class, and John Rotfner,
at 145 pounds, registered Pitt’s first
wrestling points since the West Vir-
Nevertheless, the Maze-
skimen ﬁnished their season with four
losses out of four meets.

By. Dave. He.inilton'[ V -
Taking." all but one first place," the‘.

' Panther swimming" team easily de-

f£e'ated.' the» Ohio Wesleyan Bishops
-in a Metropolitan Club pool engage-
ment Friday. evening; 51-15 was the‘-
count.’ - - r _ - -

yard free-styles, and swimming a leg:

’ in the 440-yard relay. Red ':Mc-Quil-
‘Ian, captain * and " star diver, again

won. his’ specialty to complete an un-
defeated. season on. the board.

This win over the Bishops, winding
up the Panther‘ swimming season,

‘leaves Pat Co‘rr’s natators with a rec-

'ord of ﬁve wins and three losses, with"

victories over Slippery Rock, Temples ~

‘Penn.’ State, ’_Delaware, and; the Wes-
le.yan‘s_, and defeats by Arrny’, West'-

_ern-I Reserve,. and Franklin and Mar-

shall.

Noubetter is this year's recoiidtljlan

‘last year's-, ..which: showed‘ six? wins '

and three losses. Although the 1936'
team won one more than this year’s
-squad, two of those wins were scored

again‘-st" Slippery Rock, ‘easy-‘ victims.

of the Corrmen the only" time they
were met. this season. ' ’

Judging froni the schedule, which -
- showed little change from the 1936

card". ‘Army, Franklin and Marshall,
Penn ‘S'tat‘e", and Delaware each time

forming the -nucleus, there ..was little. .

choice between the-_’3'6 and the. ’37
-editions-g of the swimming squad. I

«The record of next year’s iiatators, .

-however. should show yr decided" im_-
provement. The ,chief' we'ak'n'e'ss' of
the team this year lay in the fact

that‘ although they had plenty of" ab‘il- — ‘
_ity to -cap1_:ure_-- ﬁrsts, they‘ were weak

in getting th‘e.‘points from‘. se'c'on'd1 and
.third' places. necessary for victory;
Coac_h.. Corr expects this problem to
be solved. next year by the large
nunrber of good freshman‘ swimmers

The Wrong Approach

(Continued from Page 1)

dcncc, that the students are behind Sutherland . . .
, Some of those ideas are quite new, to say the
least; others are quite old. Most of them show
a lack of understanding of the question involved.
But that is ‘not the point with which we are. con-
cerned. ' .

The point is that if a student newspaper can-
not bring out student opinion, air it, test it, and
then pass it along for the good of the University,
there is no reason for the existence of a student
newspaper.

We are not taking issue on the contents of
that handbill. We are merely suggesting that
when a group of thirty students, a group of cori-
centrated interests at that, attempts to give their
version of student opinion in such a manner, at
such a time, they step out of their territory and
do something which does no one good" and con-
tinues to alienate people to their cause. .

A student newspaper should express student
opinion if it has a legitimate cause for expres-
sion. The News welcomes any student or group
of students in the University to speak freely and
honestly. But The News asks just one thing,

He Talked To Himself

By Milton Lehman

TWO PICTURES  
“One l'ifo,——a little gleam of time between two Eteo-n.'ities."
Portrait Of Life

Dad-:l_v had just tucked him into his crib, listened to
him lisp through his prayer with its “God bless mammo

and papa and Aunt Martha and all little boys and girls.’ -

kissed him on the forehead, and whispered “Sleep tighx
sonny.”

He was fast asleep now, his eyes closed, his face
smooth and restful, his tiny hand lying on the orchid
coverlet. The clock on the mantle claimed that it
was seven.

The soft light of the spring evening ﬁltered througr

the light green window shade. The ray can ht specks
of dustpillurninated them, lifted them to tie ceiling
dropped them back to the ﬂoor. .
. Over in the corner on a chair was a child’s lay suit
blue with white strips to ﬁt over the shoulder. lean for
the next day, it smelled of the laundry. A pair of shoes
that during the day had collected bits of mud and san('
from the back yard, was placed beneath the chair, un
cleaned.

Toys used until bed time were in a heap on the
carpet: Ronald the Duck, Mickey Mouse, is red ﬁre
engine with a copper-colored ladder, a thumb and
crayon marked “Child's Garden of Verses,” a set of
alphabet blocks, three of which were joined together
to spell “cat.”

As the ray of light from the window rose and fell, it
glanced at the Mother Goose kingdom, patterned into
the wall paper. Little Jack Horner with his Christmas
pie and Miss 1\'Iuﬁ"_et.with her curds and whey were busy
eating. The little Tin Soldier, his silver musket over his
shoulder, was chatting conﬁdent.ially to Red Riding
Hood and the Wolf. Humpty Dumpty was perched pre-
cariously on the border of the paper, ready to fall off the
wall into the room. .

The light was growing dim and, catching the motes
in itspath, had settled on the youngster in the crib.
Asleep and dreaming, perhaps, the ruddy face looked
as though it were pouting. The tiny hand on the bed

cover was clenched into a fist.

Porzrizit Of Death

It was late v:i.n1*o1'. He lay prone on the soft bed, fully
dressed, his feet rststing on an orchid blanket with satin
sheen, edged with  light. rose frill. His face was waxen
and cold, dark f_.‘.‘njl wrinkled. The wrinkles seemed to
have been slicozl into the skin, rather than to have grown
there. - 

His one hand was extended at his side, palm down.
The ﬁngernails were cleaned and polished to a cold
lustre. His other hand was crossed across his breast,
the ﬁngers hidden beneath the coat. Almost Na-
poleonic. -

The arm, hov.-*eve1*, could no longer more to direct.
Probably it had frozen in rigor mortis shortly after
the death rattle.

It was quiet in the room and yet it seemed to be
ﬁlled with unheard of noise. The pots of plants and
the vases of cut ﬂowers weighted down the air with a
sweet heady perfume.

Placed near the bed was a ‘comfortable chair-for
people who would like to sit down in the room and think
about the old man. Possibly someone had sat in the chair
to think, possibly not. At any rate, a new lighted cigar-
ette had been ground into the standing ash tray. It bal-
anced itself in the tray like a column, strangely
contorted.

The face on the bed was expressionless, hard, cold
and exp:-essionless. The coarse skin was beginning
to creep" into the bones and, although the mortician
had shaved the old man before injecting the preserva-
tive, patches of stiff stubble spotted the face. The
face was rigid, quiet. .

Almost more immense than the chest of the man, the
head was a large sl-;in—cove1'ed skull sunk into an orchid
<_‘.overed pillow. The flowers were breatliing inmge heavily
into the ah-eady heavy air of the room. The clock on the
mantle clickerl out seconcls and minutes and hours, per-
sistently, deﬁnitely, cutting thick slices of silence out of
a noiseless room. ,

The ﬁgure on the bed was still.
