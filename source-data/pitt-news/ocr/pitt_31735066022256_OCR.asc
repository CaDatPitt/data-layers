Trustees approve $300,000 renovation of O’Connor home

By David T. Welch

Asst. News Editor

The Board of Trustees unanimously
passed a resolution to fund $340,000 in
replacements and renovations to Pitt
President Dennis O’Connor’s house.

According to trustees Vice Chairperson
Frank Mosier, $130,000 is paying for
repairs necessary because of the
depreciation of the estate.

“The minimum cost for maintenance is
$130,000. [These repairs] fall under the

 

 

category of repairs. These things which
are clearly maintainable should be
[maintained] and could be paid for from

plant funds and not (tuition, public _

funding or gifts to the universityl.”

The additional $210,000 in renovations
and replacements will come from private
donations, which will be raised by the
Board of Trustees, according to trustees
Chairperson John Marous.

The use of plant funds has been
mandated for the repairs, according to
university spokesperson Tim Ziaukas.

  

“The plant budget is made up of money
raised from the sale of property and the
interest from that. It’s not tuition or
donor money. It will pay the $130,000,”
Ziaukas said. A

The repairs to the 718 Devonshire
Street estate include replacement of the
front porch, which is dry-rotting,
installation of a wheelchair ramp and
repair of the brick wall. These
improvements cost $88,100.

To make the driveway suitable for a
handicapped ramp, an additional $1 1,000

in alterations are necessary. This includes
demolition of the road base and the
installation of a new one.

Other repair costs include $15,000 in
asbestos removal and another $15,900 in
professional fees.

Air conditioning will be putin on the
first, second and third floors, costing
$85,000.

Reﬁnishing of the hardwood floors
and painting of walls and ceilingswill
cost $33,500. Re—upholstering of existing

Test required for TAs

By Gary Knapick

For The Pitt News

Theoretically, “I couldn't understand my TA” will no longer
serve as an adequate rationalization for bad grades. As of
September 1990, all teaching assistants have earned the
university’s linguistic seal of approval.

Pitt’s revised English Language Fluency Test for all prospective
teaching assistants is simply a “formalized, expanded, longer,
[and] more consistent” version of tests already required for TAs
in the school of engineering and the Faculty of Arts and
Sciences, according to associate provost and test committee
chairperson Elizabeth Baranger.

The ,change in testing procedures was prompted by
Pennsylvania’s English Fluency in Education Act, passed in Aug.
1990. The act makes Pennsylvania one of 16 states which
requires such tests.

The examination is required for all potential teaching assistants
hired after Sept. 7, 1990, who do not speak English as a first
language. _It is designed to determine which type of classes, if
any, a candidate is able to teach.

The 30-minute three-part test is administered by two members

of the linguistics department and witnessed by a representative

of the candidate’s department.
The first segment, which lasts 10 to 15 minutes, is an informal

Few smoking areas officially approved

By Jeff s. Griffin
For The Pitt News

Pitt’s Office of Environmental
Health and Safety has approved
only 20 percent of the applications
it received for designated smoking
areas on campus since the
university's no-smoking policy
began this February.

Of the approximately 60
requests for smoking areas on
university property, 12 were
officially designated, said Larry
Keller, director of environmental

3 health and safety. The remaining

48 sites remain “temporary”
smoking areas, he added.

“It takes about one hour [to
approve an areal,” Keller said. “It
is a new function of my office,
and I haven't had all the time to
get it completely covered. We're
really trying to work with our
resources."

Keller said temporary smoking
areas are approved by a

department head, dean or
university official in charge of the
location. ‘

“If a dean or department head
feels that an area is needed, they
can exercise judgment,” said
Keller. “We give them the freedom
to do it.”

Keller said designated smoking
spaces needto be away from the
traffic of non-smokers. He said
there are exceptions to his office's
guidelines. 4

“Usually a professor's office
where he entertains students
would have to remain a no-
smoking area," said Keller.

“But if there is a conference or
interview room where a dean or
department head feels [professors]
can have conferences with
students, we may approve it,”
Keller said.

Since the policy's activation,
the dorms have been designated
as smoke-free areas, said Cheryl
Campbell, area coordinator in

the Office of Residence Life.

Although they are officially no-
smoking areas, Campbell said
students in dorm rooms are not
penalized for lighting up.

“People do smoke in the privacy
of their rooms if it is acceptable to
both parties,” she said.

But if a non-smoker wants a
smoke-free room, “the smoker
must move elsewhere. A non-
smoker has the final say,”
Campbell said.

The campus police gave dorm
residents until the start of the
1991 fall semester to comply with
the .smoking ban, said Walt
Waters, assistant director of public
safety.

“When the ban went into effect,
it was in the middle of the term
and it didn't seem fair," Waters
said. “Now people in double
rooms can look for non—smokers.”

Waters said it is difficult to
enforce the ban in private dorm

Blaclelines motto, “news about
you, written by you, written for
you,” emphasizes its goal -to
represent the black- population at
Pitt. Blaclelineis the ofﬁcial paper
of the Black Action Society at the
University of Pittsburgh.

At the paper’s ﬁrst meeting of
the term last Thursday, staff
member Nicole Narvaez

suggested another quote that the

paper could use: “‘A white sheet
of paper is insigniﬁcant until you
put black ink on it,’ or something
powerful like that,” she said.
Powerful issues will dominate
the upcoming edition. One
feature will be about what
Blacleline editor JoAnn Thomas
calls “the movement to crush a
movement,” the put-down of
Afrocentrism in this country.
“On television you have the

trivializing a movement, ” Thomas
said. -

There will also be a feature on
black ﬁlmmakers: Are they better
off now, or have things gotten
worse?

One staff member brought up
the idea for an article about why
African-American and West
Indian blacks can't seem to go
eye to eye, while Narvaez raised
the point of segregation within
the race, between light— and dark-
skinned blacks.

The paper will also try to tackle
police brutality and blacks, black
colleges vs. white colleges and
health care in the black
community.

“While only 9,000 blacks donate
blood and organs, 20,000 blacks
will be in need of them, more
than any other group.” Thomas
told the staff. .

Engineering little-/enown optionfor women

By Lisa Tylak

For T be Pitt News

When Tracy McFarland’s high
school counselor saw that
McFarland was good in math, he
suggested that she become a
teacher.

But McFarland didn’t agree
with him. \X/hen she came to Pitt,
she started taking engineering
classes.

“It’s a lot ofpressure,” she said.
She decided to stay in engineering
because her degree would give
her many career options.

But many women will not have
those choices because they are
not informed about engineering
as a career choice.

“A lot of girls coming out of
high school just don’t consider it
an option,” said McFarland, who
is now president of the Society of
Women Engineers at the
University of Pittsburgh.‘

Unless they had some previous
exposure to the field, most
women do not know about
engineering, she said.

Women make up only about
15 percent of the total engineering
enrollment nationwide. Even
though overall engineering
enrollment at Pitt has been
dropping over the years, female
enrollment here has been
traditionally higher than the
national average.

In 1981, women made up 21
percent of the total enrollment in
the engineering school. In the

fall of 1990, the last semester for
which statistics are available,
women comprised 17 percent of
the enrollment.

Ironically, Benedum Hall,
which houses the school of
engineering, was built in 1971
with restrooms for women on
only every third or fourth floor,
totalling only three in the whole
building.

Changes were made in the late
19705, so now there are female
and male restrooms on almost
every floor.

This is important for a school
that is trying to break any unseen
barriers that may prevent women
from enrolling.

“I think we’re doing very well
in attracting women,” said Sandy
Bishop of freshman programs in
Benedum Hall.

To call attention to their
department, the school sends out
flyers to teachers and counselors
at high schools, asking that the
information be shown to females
and males alike.

“It has to start back there, in
high school, ” said Dr. Alice Smith,
a professor of industrial
engineering at Pitt.

She says that young women
need a lot of encouragement to
face the minority status they
encounter in engineering. She
believes that Pitt tries to give
them encouragement.

Smith, who worked for
Southwestern Bell before comin g
to Pitt to teach, said people are

not used to seeing women in
what has traditionally been a
male—dominated field.

“Certainly you stood out more,
for better -or worse,” she said.

If you are good at what you do,
people will remember you more
than your male colleague, she
said.

But you will also be
remembered more for a bad
performance, according to Smith.

“Women are being accepted in
almost any career in engineering
now," said Dr. Donna Blackmond,
professor of chemical engineering
at Pitt and faculty adviser to the
campus chapter of the Society of
Women Engineers.

SWE not only sponsors social
programs for its members, both
women" and men, but it
also sponsors academic
programs.

Each year SWE compiles a book
containing resumes from
engineering students. This book
is sent to many local companies,
as well as some larger ones out of
state.

While all engineering students
are welcome to submit their
resumes for the book, about 90
percent of the resumes come
from SWE members.

This serves as a valuable source
of publicity for women who are
looking for jobs.

“I think it is just taking time for
people to get used to seeing
women doing this kind of job”
said Blackmond.

U.S. first aid inadequate

By Barbara Hoffmann
For Tbe Pitt News

The United States is incapable of responding to mass disasters
such as a major earthquake or an industrial accident, according
to Pitt researchers. Disaster victims requiring life—supporting
treatment within the first 24 hours will die because the present
system cannot respond fast enough, they said.

Dr. Ernesto Pretto _Ir., and Dr. Peter Safar published their
findings in this month’s journal of the American Medical
Association. They said resuscitating the victim within the first 24
hours after a life—threatening injury increases the survival rate by
25 to 50 percent.

Pretto said the public needs to be educated in first aid and
basic—rescue methods. Changes need to be made to improve the
National Disaster Medical System, he said.

The NDMS would start improvements by replacing volunteer
medical teams with trained medics working together on a daily
basis at civilian trauma units, according to Pretto.

These teams would be superior to those that exist now
because they are not composed of volunteers from different
backgrounds who have never worked together before. The
current NDMS also lacks a central organized body to direct
activities during a disaster.

Pretto said if changes are made soon, then the entire system

summer has kept her from ﬁnding
her niche at the university.

But the start of the fall semester
at Pitt is exciting for her.

“It’s just beginning to get hectic
 I love it,” she exclaimed.

duties she performs as a clinical
psychologist for the Counseling
Center, Ballantyne has been busy

her daughter T imikl. ‘ ‘

Just as the giraffe gives the
decor of her office an extra touch
of color, Ballantyne’s energetic
personality adds color to the
counseling center on the third
ﬂoor of the William Pitt Union.

A “I have a level of energy and
. creativity which I believe adds to
, the department, " said Ballantyne,

who is the new clinical

psychologist and minority-service
coordinator at the counseling
center.
Ballantyne, who left her home
in Trinidad when she was 17 to
study psychology at the
University of Toronto, began
working at Pitt last May.
Although‘ she's been’ here for
three months, she said the slow

post-graduate life.

“It is difficult enough being a
minority student, but minority
graduate students feel invisible,"

Ballantyne said.

Ballantyne is also coordinating
a series of one—session workshops
for students. She initially came
up with the idea of the workshops
in the
counseling office at the University
of Buffalo, where she got her
doctorate in psychology.

If you depend on your computer to
be more than a word processer, graduat-
ing to a NeX'lstation" computer may be
the smartest course you ever take.

While we can't promise a NeXTsta-
tion will carry you all the way through
college in a month, we can promise it
will cany you all the way through col-
lege. And graduate school. And, pardon ‘ -
the expression, the real world.

GRADUATE IN
OCTOBER. -

That's because no other desktop
computer brings such a full suite of
workstation features to bear on such a
wide range of research, analysis, report
yvntihg, and problem solving tasks.

Features like a high-perforrnance 15
MIPS CPU, a minimum of8 MB of
RAM and I05 MB of hard disk storage,
a full UNIX“ operating system, true
multitasking. 3D graphics, and built—in
Ethernet networking.

And no other desktop computer sur-
rounds this much power with the easy-
to-use graphical interface — and the
easy-to-live-with price —— of a personal‘
computer.

With the right software, it's all the
computer any college student needs.

And between August 15 and October
31, we'll make acquiring the right soft-
ware practically painless.

Buy any NEXT" CPU between now
and then and get WordPerfect‘,’the pre-
mier word processor. SoftPC? the AT-
class MS-DOS°emulator, and Diagraml",
the powerful drawing and diagramming
package. for less than $300. That’s near-
ly $1400 worth of the most popular pro-
ductivity tools available for less than
$300 bucks.

What's more, graduating to a NeXT
computer doesn't require a lot of prereq-
uisites. Just a visit to a campus reseller.

And now's the time to do it.

Because the sooner you
graduate, the easier college
will become.

Blackline

Continued from page 2

Blacleline steps in,” Thomas said.

\What disturbed Thomas most
about The Pitt News was last
spring’s surface coverage of the
14 demands made on the
university by the Black Action

— Society.

“This left readers ignorant and
to make their own presumptions,
and because of it the BAS
suffered," Thomas’ said.

But Tbe Pitt News’ recent
coverage of the cultural—diversity
celebration was handled well and
presented a good overall picture
of events, Thomas said.

Blacleline will also have a
lighterside to it; one segmentwill
feature a- student spotlight,
highlighting A a unique and
outstanding black student at Pitt.

Former Blacleline editor Lisa
James said, “We know who the
best dressers on campus are, but
this is a chance to bring out the
person with the best [grade—point
averagel.” Or “someone who can
sing or dance,” Thomas said.
“That’s exciting. Or the only black
student on the crew or tennis
team." .

The _grou p would like to see an
advice column such as “Dear
Blacleline," “but it would have to
be relevant to black issues —
questions about boyfriends or

girlfriends could be asked,

anywhere,” Thomas said. The
group also questioned who would
write the response.

Other features still in the
planning stages are comic strips

and a suggestions and comments
box.

Thomas, a senior from
Baltimore, Md., started with
Blacleline as a staff writer during
[her first year, and since then has
seen quite a number of changes
in format.

“When I first started, [Bladelinel
wasn’t developed to its fullest
potential. It was more like a
pamphlet of tidbits of
information,” she said.

Now, the four-page paper is
distributed in the Towers lobby
and various locations throughout
the campus, four times a year -
September, October, February
and April —— with a total of 2,000

copies per year. -»

’February’s issue will have a
complete listing of events for
Black History Month. Thomas is
also planning send copies to black
colleges and organizations out of
state. A
“I guess the goal is to get black
students to read the paper, like
they ﬂock to other papers.”
Thomas said. —
“We want to raise the level of
consciousness of black students,
open their eyes to political.
situations we face and raise our
status as Afro-Americans in this
country. We have to start making
a change here at Pitt. As an old
African proverb says, ‘You must
bloom where you are planted.”’
Glancing at her watch, Thomas
said, “It's Cosby time, so this
meeting is over," and declared

‘ the meeting to be adjourned.

"I'm in my own room. I’m
paying for it,’" he said.

Even if applications were
filed to designate smoking
areas in dorms, Campbell said
a lack of space would limit
their number.

“Right now Pitt's dorms
remain smoke-free, and there

are no designated areas,”
Campbell said. “We need some
designated areas so people
aren’t running outside
constantly to smoke,” she said.

Keller said, “The policy is
one that requires cooperation
to make it workable. Not like
traffic laws, it’s a matter of
respect for colleagues,
fellow students, faculty and
staff."

conversation between the
examiners and the teaching
assistant. In the second phase,
the teaching assistants are
required to lecture for 10 minutes
in their academic area, just as
they would in a classroom setting.

In the third phase, the
examiners test the candidate’s
ability to field questions about
the lecture.

Lois Wilson of the linguistics
department said the tests are
designed to measure
comprehension of English.

Michael Perloff, assistant chair
of the philosophy department,
witnessed the testing of three of
his graduate students. He
describes the testing as “very
thorough.”

Individuals are then ranked on
the linguistics departments 5-
point scale.

A score of 4 or 5 will permit the
TA to teach a recitation.
Candidates who receive a 3 are
permitted to teach labs and grade
papers but may not teach on a
level where they are required to
verbally interact with students.

Candidates who receive a 3
must attend 14 hours of remedial
English classes in the university’s
English Language Institute.

Candidates receiving scores of
1 or 2 are not permitted to teach,
even though Pennsylvania law
does restrict them from teaching
labs. Before taking the test again,
these candidates must attend
remedial English classes and
workshops in American culture.

According to Lois Wilson, “a
little less than half’ of the TA
hopefuls who took the test scored
in the 4 to 5 range. Of the
remaining candidates, “a great
majority” scored a 3, she said.

Because the candidates are
required to take the test again
after their remedial work is
completed, Wilson described the
evaluation as “a better test and a
better process.”

Despite the efforts of the
university to ensure a qualiﬁed
staff of TAs, many students still
feel slighted. “When you pay this
much money for an education, it
would be nice to have a TA you
can understand,” said‘Pitt first-
year student Darren Froeschl.

Wilson asked for sympathy
from disgruntled students. “I wish
undergraduates would have more
patience. Sometimes they are
very prejudiced against their
foreign T A5.”

Unit oﬁers diversity

By Diana McLaughlin '
For The Pitt News l

Andy Rolnick lived in the International Living Unit last year.
“I was often up until four in the morning, learning about the
world by talking to people,” he said.

Chuck Diener, another ILU resident, said, “I ﬁgured, ‘The
people I’ll be meeting here from other countries are going to
be like me  adventurers, explorers and a little bit silly.”’

As part of Cultural Diversity Week, the offices of Residence
Life and International Services sponsored the International
Living Unit Hotel Party Thursday night.

According to Sue Uhazie, a resident director "and co-
chairperson for People Appreciating Differences, the event
was set up to let students experience some of the cultures
represented by the ILU and teach them about differences in
politics, economics, religion, customs, food and music.

The 11th floor of Bruce Hall, where the ILU is located,
houses students from America, Bahrain, the Cayman Islands,
Israel, Japan, Nigeria, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey and the Virgin
Islands, said Betty Smith, resident assistant for the 11th ﬂoor.

Uhazie said only 120 students of the 500 who signed up for .

the program on Thursday could be accommodated. Volunteers
and members of the ILU escorted them through rooms
representing various countries. '

Jon Anderson, in his fourth year of ILU life, hopes the ILU

“will be able to foster some understanding that other people , '

don’t have the chance to.”

Anderson, who considers himself an open—minded person, I

learned through his ILU experiences that he uses stereotypes

“more than I, care to admit.” _

Exhibit displays ‘Children at Play’ 

By Beth Kovaly
Sta_[fWr1'ter

Artwork depicting biking in
Belgium, swimming in Colombia
and ‘ a folk festival in
Germany is currently on display
in the William Pitt Union art
gallery.

“Children at Play” is the theme
of the exhibit, sponsored by the
Pitt Program Council as part of
the ongoing cultural-diversity
festival.

The pieces in the exhibit come
from the United Nations
Children’s Fund. The artists are
children between theages of five
to 15. -

Julie Veil, arts committee
director V-for the PPC,
planned the exhibit over the
summer. —

“This theme has been done
here before. It was recommended
to me by a former director. There
were different [UNICEF]
ideas to choose from,” Veil said.

“This is for cultural diversity. It‘
,,goes

along with that
theme.” 9
“Children at Play” is UNICEF’s

idea that “children all over the

expressed through colorful
works done with paints,
crayons, magic markers and
watercolors.

Other nations included are
Ethiopia, Haiti, Norway, Japan
and the United States.

The union's art gallery holds
monthly exhibits throughout the
year. Many. of these are backed
by the Pitt Program Council.

Veil and a 15—member
committee decide which
art shows will be displayed in the
gallery.

“There’s a ton of stuff that we
could do,” Veil explained. "1 have
a pile of possible programming. I
take_ it to my committee, and we

‘ try to decide who would mainly

like this. ’

"lt’s hard; it seems sometimes
people are so apathetic, and they
don’t care what's going on
anyway. That makes it harder,
when you know people aren’t
going to come to your event,”
Veil said.

Nancy Schramek, a studioarts

major, works in the gallery about

15 hours a week. She sees a  ll‘

handful of people come into the ’
exhibit daily. .

“A lot of people don’t know it’s"“ I

here. I'll tell people I work here,.
and they ask, ‘Where is it?”’
Schramek said.

, So the $82,000 was just the first few marbles in the
bucket, but spending is fast becoming]. Dennis O’Connor’s
way.

The recent announcement of renovations to O’Connor’s
house on Devonshire Street have the university community
in an uproar. According to The Pittsburgh Press, the new
pres has spent an average of $9,814 dollars for each day
he has spent in office. ‘

Preservation of this $400,000 house seems almost
ridiculous when compared to the cost of renovation:
$340,000. Wouldn’t it be much easier and economical to
move O’Connor into a new $250,000 house that wouldn’t
need repairs?

According to trustees Vice Chairperson Frank Mosier,
the house is a ‘?window to the university and an area
where we want to put our best foot forward.” ’

Asbestos removal (cost: $15,000) and the installation of
a handicap ramp (cost: $1 1,000) are the only
understandable and justifiable expenditures on the list.

A plant fund, made up of money raised from the sale and

interest of property will cover the maintenance costs for f

thelhouse. The rest will be paid by private donations and
gifts to the university. Although the money for the
renovations won’t be coming‘ entirely from our pockets,
the money could have undoubtedly gone to better uses
around Pitt. —

Coming around again

The Pitt administration has dealt the university community
a bad hand once again. , '

Staff and faculty members work as hard at Pitt as
administrators do, if not harder. They are here to educate
us, Pitt’s tuition-paying students, and they should be
equally compensated.

However, at a Board of Trustees meeting last Thursday,
professors were once again upset by the decision to raise
their payonly slightly: a total of 7.5 percent over last year’s
salaries. ‘ ' . -

If that wasn’t enough to make them a little more than
slightly agitated at the Board, now they can be angry with
the administration, too: Thomas Detre, president of the
university medical center, was handed a 5 percent pay
raise, adding an extra $18,000 to his already $360,000
salary. - . I

It gets worse. Provost Donald Henderson received-a 9
percent increase in his salary, bringing his yearly total to
$144,750. Vice President and Director of Student Affairs
William Harmon was given an $8,500 raise, a 10 percent
increase over his $85,000 salary.

Although the percentages of faculty raises versus
administrative raises are extremely close, the actual
numbers involved are significantly different. ‘

I For a change, Pitt went public with a breakdown of the
costs before being pressed to do so. But being honest

4:3‘ does not excuse the lack of parity in Pitt salaries.

Evasion a repeat performance

The earliest I ever tried it was the sixth grade. I

became a regular user in junior high school and by '

high school I was addicted. Now, I am, almost out
of control. My name is Ed, and I am a procrastinator.

I realize I am not alone with this problem. In the
two years I have lived in my residence hall, there
have been many nights where numerous doors
would still be open at three in the morning. Inside

only half its required length. As I rode the bus
home, I hoped the professor would have mercy

and give me a grade good enough to fill the _

requirement. Only by his grace did I get a C-. A -

J High school, however, was different. I‘ could
write some papers in a study hall right before the

class and get a B. My classmates would cheer me
on as I would reach completion when the bell

would bea frantic student

of reading or trying to write ‘a
perfect term paper overnight.
Many people think they

would ring. They respected my
courage. They also, envied my
luck. Back in high school, term
papers were to be year—long
projects. In my junior and senior

procrastinate, but I have
developed a personal relationship with the word.

For instance, I paid attention in Latin class when
we learned the word that means “for tomorrow.” I
am not for tomorrow, because that is when the
assignment is due. I am for today and as much
today as possible. I wish the night we turn back our
clocks for daylight savings would be the time I have
a paper due. That extra hour could be extremely
helpful.

Procrastination has never accomplished anything
for me. In no way do I believe that the less you

"work on something, the better it will be. The

assignments on which I got A’s would probably
remain the same. However, I shortchanged a lot of
work, and it showed in some of my grades.

My darkest moment came at the end of the first
semester last year. On the day I was to go home for
the winter break I had a take—home ﬁnal due in
political science. The test required knowledge of
the works of Locke, Rousseau and Mill. I had not
started on any of them. In one night I had to read
the philosophies-that provided the bases of our
Declaration of Independence and Constitution.
Then I had to write about them. A

The language and“ the ideas were so hard to
understand it seemed like it took forever to read
anything. Time forced me to skim the texts and
hastily scratch out an assignment which fulﬁlled

Pitt inconsiderate of Jewish holiday

- years I did the bulk of the work
the weekend before it was due. I tortured myself
with endurance tests in which I became delusionary,
but two B+’s were well worth the effort;

My greatest A came only last semester. Three

days before a 10-12 page political science paper N

 

 

was due, I camped out in the library, trying to ﬁnd _  ‘H

a topic. This was an A paper, so you know I found
a topic. I spent two days researching it, which left

one day to sort out the loads of information I had ‘

gleaned from the Hillman shelves and, of course,
write about it.

I sat calmly at my computer, guzzled iced tea and
coffee, made countless trips to the bathroom, but
I pounded out a masterpiece. I was so exhausted

. when I was done that my thighs hurt. When I feel '

pain after doing nothing physical, I know I pushed
too hard. But no pain, no gain, and I gained an A.
I was at the top of my procrastinating form.

 I suppose procrastination will always remain part ‘

of college life. I may be an accomplished
procrastinator, but relying on that last night has

already cost me grade points. I would gladly trade , '

the fun I had instead of working for those points.
I guess they are forever lost in the Graveyard of
Procrastination.

Friday the 13th, unlucky for

most, was horriﬁc for the Pitt /

lost three out of four matches in
last weekend’s Indiana State
Tournament, dropping their
overall record to 6-4.

“Friday the 13th really gotus,”

said Pitt head coach Sue

not up to what it should have
been.”

Terrible Friday started with
senior co-captain Sue Zonneville

This illness prevented her from
playing in the tournament. “She’s
one person we don’t play
without,” said Woodstra of
Zonneville. _

With Zonneville out, the

_ Panthers went into Indiana State
Arena to face a fired-up Auburn
team, sweltering heat and Friday

After three hours of competition
in over 90 degree heat, Pitt fell to

THE PITI‘ NEWS, Monday, September 16, 1991

How about Pitt Panther tight
end Eric Seaman?

This man is off to an impressive
start this season, already catching
nine passes in three games for
103 yards. At this rate he will

Bob
Maselli

destroy his career best of 16
catches for 228 yards set last
season.

Seaman is such a strong, quick,
intelligent player one can’t miss
his performance on the field. He
is an excellent blocker, he always
seems to get open, he never
drops a pass, and it takes at least
three men to bring the “big

‘ lumbering tight end” down.

When you watch Seaman play,
it’s as if he wants to get hit, or hit
somebody. He's in on every play,
and when he does catch the ball
he’s not afraid to take a wallop.
When he catches the ball, he
doesn't run out of bounds, or for
that matter away from an
oncoming defender.

He catches the ball and actually
runs at someone, and many times
runs .them over. I definitely
wouldn’t want to be hit by this 6-
foot, 4-inch, 24S—pound third—year
letterman who’s a shoe-in for the
NFL.

This sure-handed receiver plays

the game like it’s the last game he
is ever going to play.

Other notes from around the
world of sports:

oWell, the Panther football
team is 3-0, much better than
some people thought they would
be at this time, and some people
still have doubts about them.
This is understandable, but let’s
call a peach a peach, a spade a
spade and the Panthers a good
solid threat to the world of college
football.

They are surprising a lot of jg

people, including this sports
writer, but they are showing us
they have the talent.

Obviously the season isn’t at all
over, but the near future holds
good things for the Panthers.
Don’t let yourself fall asleep,
because when you wake up you
just might see this Panther team
in a bowl gamecome the holiday
season.

Prediction — and you read it
here — Pitt will beat Notre Dame
and Penn State. ‘Nuff’said.

-Word out there is that our
new athletic director, Oval Jaynes,
has attended all three football
games so far this season, and he

team on.

An inside source saw him at

ago, cheering and jumping
around and raising his fist in a
victorious manner after the game.

Soccer fights to draw with Redmen

By Christopher Block_
Staﬂ' Writer

While the sun beat down
unmercifully at Pitt stadium
Sunday afternoon, the Pitt Panther
soccer team and its St. John's
counterparts blazed a torrid trail

. of their own on the way to a 1-1

tie.

The Panthers entered the game
on a two-game winning streak,
having beaten Geneva College
and Carnegie Mellon in their
previous rnatch-ups. The St John's
Redmen came in to this game
sporting a 2-1 record.

    
 
     

sharp early on. With just six
minutes expired from the clock,
Pitt first-year player Erik Prex
laced a shot toward the net only
to be denied by St. John’s diving
goalkeeper, John Urbon. Neither
Urbon nor Panther goalkeeper
Tim Sobelman had been scored
upon in any of their respective
team’s victories. .

In the early stage of the game,
the Redmen applied strong
pressure to the Panther’s defense.
Each time the team was denied
by the strong play of Pitt
defensemen Bob Dyer, Scott
McCurry and Mike Watson.

the St. John’s defense and riﬂed a
shot toward the net but was
again rejected by a sprawling
Urbon.

Halfway through the first half
the advantage shifted, and the
Panthers were able to turn the
play in their favor. Following a
yellow card infraction to Redmen
forward Roberto DeLuca, the
Panthers were able to string a
series of shots at the St. John’s
goal. A yellow card is assessed to
a player or coach when he violates
a rule. -

Temple coach Jerry Berndt agreed, adding that his quarterback
ran too soon . “Trent took a beating,” said Berndt. “He did more
running thanhe should have. He just got a little excited.”

Fans got a little nervous when Pitt receiver Chad Askew
fumbled the ball after catching a pass on the first play of the
game. Temple recovered, but missed a 26-yard field goal. On
Temple’s next series, Whaley stepped in front of the Owls’ Sam
Jenkins and picked off Thompson’s pass, giving Pitt the ball on
the Temple 36-yard line. From there, Pitt kept it on the ground,
and Glenn Deveaux scored on a two~yard run to open the
scoring.

Scott Kaplan added a 39-yard field goal in the second quarter,
giving Pitt a 10-0 lead, and Chris Bouyer hauled in an Alex Van

Pelt pass for a nine-yard TD just three minutes later, putting the '

Panthers up by 17, which was the halftime margin.

Steelers

Continued from page 10
third and two at the 11-yard line.
Staurovsky converted from 28
yards out to give the Patriots a 6-
5 lead.

A Greg Lloyd interception off a.

tip by defensive end Kenny
Davidson gave the Steelers the
ball at the 37 of the Patriots, and
a 24-yard pass from Brister to
Louis Lipps got the ball to the 13.
Brister threw incomplete on third
and six from the nine, a play
Brister said was messed up by a
mis—run route by Dwight Stone,
and the Steelers seemed ready to
settle for a field goal.

After an offside penalty on the
Pats made it fourth and one at the
four, Steeler coach Chuck Noll
gambled and lost, as Foster was
stopped for no gain.

W/hen Noll was asked why he
disdained the field goal, he joked,
“Because I’m greedy-.”

One problem for the offense
was the inability to run the ball.

_ They gained only 23 yards on 10

carries in the first half.

“They have some big, strong
people inside who play the run
very well,” said Noll. “They’re
No. 1 against the run. They were
before this and I don’t think we
changed that much. We had
trouble running the football. We
tried to run the football and they
were very strong and physical
and nailed us.”

When they got the ball with
1:26 left in the half there was no
time to run the ball. Brister
completed five of six passes,
throwing one away, for 52 yards
to set up a 32-yard field goal for
Anderson. Itwas Anderson’s 55th
straight from inside 35 yards, a
streak that goes back to 1987.

“We needed that,” said Brister.
“It did give us a little confidence
that we could throw the ball.”

Noll was faced with another
fourth and one midway through
the third quarter, this time at the
Patriot 36, and opted for the
punt. When asked why, Noll
joked, “Because I got chicken.

9, Greedy one time and chicken the

other. I was intimidated.”

It seemed the offense needed a
big play from the defense or/a
New England mistake to get it
going and got two big mistakes.
A mix—up between Patriot
quarterback Tom Hodson and
receiver Irving Friar on the last
play of the third quarter led to a
pass that was nowhere near any
Patriot receiver and right into the
hands of Steeler safety Thomas

gffiverett, who returned the ball 27

Q

 

yards to the New England 48. The
second mistake came four plays
later as a blown Pat coverage left
tight end Eric Green wide open
on the sideline. Brister hit him
and Green rumbled into the end
zone for a 32-yard score.

The Steelers has a 13-6 lead,
but New England wasn’t done
screwing up. A pooch punt by
Dan Stryzinski put New England
at their own 1 1, and a Keith Willis
sack put them back at the one.
Two incomplete passes later,
Bryan Wagner came onto punt
from his own end zone. The punt
hit one of the Patriot players and
went into the waiting arms of
rookie receiver Ernie Mills for a
Pittsburgh touchdown and a 20-

6 lead.

The Steeler defense seemed to
have totally recovered from any
remaining shell-shock from giving
up 52 points to the Buffalo bills
the previous week. They gave up
only 174 yards of total offense, 92
passing. Willis, Jerrol Williams
and Aaronjones all had one sack
each.

“I’m happy with the fact that
our defense kept them off the
scoreboard, no touchdowns,” said
Noll, “I think the scores [the
Patriots] did get were on our
offense, on the fumbles.”

The. offense was not as
impressive. The running game
never did get going, the team
ended_up with only 43 yards on
21 carries. Foster, who had run
for 199 yards on 26 carries in the
first two games of the season,
managed only 32 yards on 14
carries.

“The reason we weren’t running
the ball was because they were
stacking eight guys [up frontl,”
Brister said, “It doesn’t make any

sense to run up in there against a

brick wall. When they’ve goteight
guys‘ in there, it's one-on-one out
wide. They're really saying that-
we can't beat them passing when
they stick eight guys in there like
that.”

Brister was much more
successful through the air. He
completed 22 of 29 passes for 262
yards, the one touchdown to
Green and no interceptions.

Lipps lead in receiving with
seven catches for 86 yards. He
passed Lynn Swann for second
place on the Steelers all-time
receiving yardage list with 5,476
yards to Swann’s 5,462.

The fans still did not seem
satisfied, continually booing

Brister.

“People get tainted,” said Noll
of the fans’ treatment of Brister,
“They know Terry [Bradshaw]
was perfect, Jim Finks was perfect,
andTedMarchibroda, he’s perfect
now.”

In all, Noll seemed satisfied
with the performance of his
offense.

“We're always looking to be
perfect,” said Noll, “We weren’t,
but we did what we had to do to
win, and that’s what it’s all about.”

Brister answered any questions
about whether the team should
have had an easy time with the
Patriots, “Everybody _is going to
say New England isn’t that good
of a team and we should have
beat them. Whoever said that
should get their ass out there and
play. We had to take [the game],
nobody gave it to us.”

Sobelman, who was able to corral
the incoming ball before any
damage could be done.

Late in the half, pressure by the
Redmen led to three quality shots
including one that hit the side bar
of the goal. The strong pressure
by both offenses kept the defense
and goalkeepers quite busy
throughout the half.

With less than a minute
remaining in the half, Pitt senior
Al Lopus slid a pass to his brother
John, who was slicing toward the
net. The younger brother
narrowly missed giving the
Panthers the first tally of the game.

After the half—time break, Pitt
senior Nick Liberati led off the
second half with a shot that nearly
found the back of the net. Another
opportunity for Pitt was aborted
after an offsides violation was
called, thus nullifying a
breakaway opportunity.

At 37:50 of the second half, St.
John's first-year player Paul
Edwards was assessed a yellow
card for an undisclosed infraction;

With more than 20 minutes
remaining in regulation, DeLuca
was assessed a Red card for using
colorful language on the playing
field. A red card serves to eject a
player from the remainder of the
game and leaves his team playing
with one less man.

When regulation time expired

‘ and no goals had been scored,

the two teams began the overtime
looking to ﬁnally net a goal.

The Panthers struck first as
sophomore Panther Ted
Noethling shot at the net but did
not score. Teammate Bobby
Wasson ripped the ball past an
extended Urbon to give the
Panthers and their fansa 1-0 lead.

With less then five minutes
remaining in the overtime,
Redman Vinny Maimone slipped
between the Pitt defense and
scored the tying goal.

Although the Panthers were
unable to come away with the
win, they played a strong game
and tied a team thatwas predicted
to finish much higher in the
conference. '

Continued from page 10
the day. Pitt continued to struggle

and fell to the Cardinals by scores w

of 15-9, 14-16, 10~15 and 8-15.

Zols led Pitt with 12 kills.
Lucanie had 11 kills but 10 hitting
errors. The team kill percentage
was a dismal .105.

Louisville had an impressive
performance from Shannon
Misek, who contributed 15 kills
and 26 digs. Her defensive effort
paced the Cardinals.

“Louisville was very intense,”
said Woodstra. “They played
inspired and played to win."

After a poor start, Saturday the
14th deﬁnitely looked better. Pitt
played well soundly defeating
Indiana State, 5-0, and winning
by scores of 15~2, 15-9 and 15-10.

Again Zols led the Panthers
with 10 kills and a hitting
percentage of .421. '

Hollands and first-year player
Tracy Komar I had strong
performances for the ‘Lady
Panthers. Eight service aces also
helped defeat the hometown
team.

Jessica Barkman’s nine kills led
Indiana State’s, offense in the
losing effort.

In Pitt’s final match of the
tournament, the ghosts of Friday
came back to haunt them. Illinois
State, down 0-1, rallied to defeat
the Panthers 3-]. '

After playing better against

Indiana State, the Lady Panthers
again fell on hard times. Twelve
service errors and a lowly hitting
percentage of .157 was Pitt’s
downfall.

Dee MacAuIay, the other senior
co-captain, had a strong game
after average performances on
Friday.

“MacAulay played especially
well on Saturday," said Coach
Woodstra. The Lady Panthers
needed her leadership since
Zonneville was ill.’

Zonneville’s absence hurt Pitt’s
middle attack. Auburn . and
Louisville exploited the vacuum
in the middle of ~ the Panther
defense.

' Coach Woodstra praised the.
play of Hollands, whose versatility
helped fill the void left by
Zonneville. ‘ ‘

Woodstra also praised the play
of ﬁrst—year setter Anne Mernagh.
“Mernagh is coming along well
this early in the season,” she said.

Woodstra claimed that it was
not one area of play that hurt her
team. “We fought pretty hard this
past weekend,” said Woodstra.
“We will have to bounce back
and come out strong against
Western Michigan on Friday.”

The Lady Panthers return to
action this weekend at Fitzgerald

willingness to learn are needed.

“NDMS may be good for a

earthquake,” Pretto said.

Pretto said Congress and the
public do not consider the NDMS
an important issue because. a
mass disaster has never occurred

“People have no concept of
what an earthquake can do and

The first series of workshops
focuses on healthy relationships.
The topics discussed in the four
sessions of the series include how
to deal with poor self—esteem in
relationships, awkwardness,
conﬂicts and saying goodbye.

Unlimited Success is the title of

the second series, which will
“target self-defeating habits that
prevent us from achieving our
fullest potential,” Ballantyne said.

Beginning the second series
will be a Personal Achievement
workshop, which will be led by
Ballantyne and will explore the
problems students have with
negative feelings they have about
themselves and their tendencies
toward self-defeat.

The last of the series is on «

procrastination and time
management. All the sessions
except Personal Achievement
will be led by interns and students
in the Counseling Center.
Ballantyne said she has more

to add to the counseling center.

“My favorite part here is the .

freedom I have to do what I want
to do. I can create a sense of
having multiple interests and
being able to go with them.”
