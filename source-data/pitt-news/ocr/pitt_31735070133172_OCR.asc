Pittsburgh’s rivers ﬂow outside the long facade of the Ste Correctional Institution i Pittsburgh’s- North Side.

CHRISTIAN NIEDAN
Staff Writer

The rivers have ﬂowed here since‘

long before the prison was built, and
they will be here long after it is dust.
But that’s little consolation to the men
spending the rest of their lives within
walls topped with razor wire.

In Pennsylvania, criminal defen-
dants convicted of al'ﬁrst- or second-
degree murder, but not sentenced to
death, automatically receive natural
life sentences without the possibility of
parole. Pennsylvania, Louisiana, South
Dakota, Illinois, Iowa and Maine are
currently the only states in the union

where life truly must mean life.

If you’re a ‘flifer” in the State
Correctional Institution at Pittsburgh,
on the city’s North Side, and you’re
lucky enough to be able to see the
Ohio, the Allegheny, or the
Monongahela, the view is not uplifting,
and the days are not cinematic. They-
can’t be summed up with the unwaver-
ing hope of a, “Shawshank
Redemption" or the animalistic brutal-
ity of HBO’s “Oz.”’ Many a lifer will
die after long decades, without their
Hollywood ending. .

But there are voices calling
through the walls and fences — the
voices of men serving life here who

gather each week in a prison room to
conduct meetings of the Lifers
Association. Using the procedures of

' Roberts Rules of Order, these men use

their voices each meeting to advocate
for prison system reform and lifer free-
dom, and to use their actions as a stabi-
lizing force in a place where hope can
be hard to come by.

_ Association member , James
Ashanta Sullivan —, age 59, 31 years
served — can boil down a meeting.

John Kerry calls
on students to  
register and vote

ROCHELLE HENTGES &
NIKKI SCHWAB
Staff Report

Young people don’t vote.
, Although nearly all college stu-
dents have heard this statement,'in
one form or another, during the last
few months, few have personally

“heard it from Senator and probable"

Democratic presidential nominee
John Kerry himself. _

But yesterday, Kerry held a con-
ference call with college newspaper
writers from across the nation, dur-
ing which he spoke about the lack of

young voter participation, among ’

other topics. . .

“Young people have this tremen-
dous power, and they really need to
understand it andpembraée it and use
it,7’ Kerry said.

“I think young people need to .

reemerge as a political‘ force in
America,” he added.
Pitt students will get a chance to

phear Kerry speak about apathy

among young voters on Friday,
when he plans to visit Pitt’-s campus
as part of his “Change Starts with U:
Kerry Campus Tour 2004” cam-
paign. He will be joined by Blink
182 singer Tom DeLonge," Gov. Ed
Rendell and Pittsburgh Steelers leg-
end Franco Harris. Jon Bon Jovi will
perform. .

Kerry opened yesterday’s con-
ference call with a brief statement
about the issue of college afford-
ability. /_

He equated President George W.
Bush’s tax-cut-for-the-wealthy poli-
cy with tuition increases, saying that
the one causes the other.

_ Kerry explained that thousands
of potential ‘ students have been

‘priced out -of college this - year

Awards decisions tougherin Greek adviser’s absence

received third place.

“In lieu of everything that hap-
pened with losing Anita [Triggs]
partway through the year, we really
did an amazing job” Romba said.
Triggs, former Greek adviser,
resigned earlier this semester.

The Cathedral Awards were also
awarded to the most outstanding
sorority and fraternity of the year at
the formal. Judged by a committee
of members from student life, the
awards are judged on various
aspects of Greek life including

    

    

leadership, scholarship, recruitment

and philanthropy.

Michele Scott-Taylor, Black
Action Society’s adviser, was part
of the committee for the Cathedral
Awards. ‘

“It was difficult; ‘they were all
competitive,” Taylor said.

Terry Milani spoke about how
the committee members made their
decision. »

“The competition for the awards
was quite intense; it was a difficult
decision to make,” hesaid.

“We were able to make the deci-
sion -by [individually] ranking the

     
  

candidates,” Milani said.
“Discussing our rankings clearly
identified the winners.”

Milani added that the loss of the Z

former Greek adviser did not make
the decisions more difficult.

“Anita could’ve lent nuances,”
Milani said. “But the good thing
about this process was that it was
totally objective”

Milani and the other members
of the Cathedral Award committee

looked for how ’ well particular A

groups documented their cases.

In a Pitt Program Council seminar Monday, students learned the practice of shiatsu,

because of rising tuition costs. His

‘ program, he said, would give $50

billion in tax credits to families to
help pay for college. He also
promised to create jobs for these stu-
dents upon graduation.

When asked about social securi-
ty, Kerry assured that, under his
plan, the program would be around
for the children and grandchildren of
today’s young people.

“I will guarantee that Social
Security will be there through the
rest of the century,” he said. If the
tax cut is rolled back, he explained,
Social Security would be “just fine.”

But young people need to orga-

nize and push for what they want, he
added A _ .

“If you don’t like the USA
PATRIOT Act  get a new attorney
general  get a new Congress,” he
said, encouraging voting.

Kerry called the upcoming elec-
tion “a choice between common
sense and a failed economic policy,”
he said.

Students can pick up free tickets
at the William Pitt Union ticket
office for John Kerry’s Friday
appearance. Security gates will open
at 9 a.m. for the event, which will
take place in a roped—off portion of
Bigelow Boulevard, between the
Cathedral of Learning and the
William Pitt Union.

edge. A lot of the guys in here have got
locked up in the hole forever and don’t
ever come out,” he said. "
According to Ed Logan — age 56,
33 years served —— the psychological
trauma of doing life in prison is just as

' hard on an inmate’s family. His sib-

lings came to visithim in the begin-
ning, but during his first decade of time
served, their trips trickled away to
nothing — an experience echoed by
many other lifers and something ‘he
blames on the harsh stigma that comes
with a relative serving time for a vio-
lent crime. « ,

‘‘[People] don’t realize that when a
person goes to prison, you’re not only
putting yourself in prison, but you’re
putting your whole family and the peo-
ple you.’re associated‘ with, because
[of] guilt by association.”

This withering strain on family
relationships is most evident in the
bare conﬁnes of the visiting room. For
Lifers Association President Richard
Diggs, the structured visits, which are

closely monitored by prison _ guards.

whose primary function is not to be
sociable, can be emotionally devastat-
ing. A 9 '

“When you’re sitting here, if you
have, like in our cases as lifers, any of
our family members that [have] stuck
with us for 15 to 20 years, they’re just

— as hurt, just as tired, and just as frus-

trated. And sometimes they come down
here and they just want to cry. And
when you rub your hand on the back of
their shoulder while they’re crying,
your visit is subject tobe terminated,
depending on the officer,” Diggs said.

About 900 miles southwest of
Pittsburgh, sitting‘ on the muddy banks
of the Mississippi River, are 18,000
acres _of former slave plantation land in
Louisiana known as “The Farm.” The
Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola
is the largest state maximum-security
prison in the country and, with roughly
85 percent of lifers dying within its

‘walls, the best functioning example of
enforcing sentences of life without
parole.

For lifers in Pennsylvania, a par-
don or commutation from the governor
is the key to freedom. Since the 1979
departure of Governor Milton Shapp,
who oversaw a relatively progressive
era of pardoning lifers and prison
reform, those keys have been used with
increasing rarity. According to the
Pennsylvania Prison Society, since for-
mer governor Robert Casey left office
in 1995, only one person —— out of a
current state lifer population of about

3,900 —— has had a sentence commut-

“By mere fact of there only being ‘

[five] other states with that sentencing
structure, it makes one wonder if there
is different meaning of life in other
states,” Diggs said. “I mean, ' why
wouldn’t they have some universal
code?”

As part of the quest for pardons or
commutations of their sentences, lifers
are subject to reviews, by a board, of

their crimes, to see what they have

\

done with their time while serving their
sentences. According to Lifers
Association members, even if they
keep a clean record —,while sefving in
an environment rife with violence and
substance temptation — these reviews
often focus on the violence of their
crimes, rather than any attempt at self-
improvement. '

“The community wants to see

some restitution for whatever the situa- .

tion that they assume brought you here,
but you never get aichance, because
what happens is if you’re not just godly
given, I mean the spirit is just really
trying to be cool,” Sullivan said. “I’ve
been here 31 years, and the last time I
had a ﬁght was 30 years ago, and I’ve

‘been living in places where combat is,

you know — this is gladiator school.”

Two years ago, state Sen. Stewart
J. Greenleaf, R—Montgomery County,
introduced a resolution in the state
Senate that would form a task force to
study future health, care cost alterna-
tives for the Pennsylvania prison popu-
lation, which is among the nation’s
oldest. He put the cost to the state of
housing older inmates in the system at
between $75 and $80 thousand per per-
son, per year. In 2002, state prisons
held almost l9_00 inmates between the
ages of 55 and-92, according to a pub-
lic statement by Corrections Secretary
Jeffrey Beard.

Financial motivation, according to
Diggs, plays a large part in
Pennsylvania’s membership in the six-
state no-parole group.

“There’s an economic value behind
this in Pennsylvania, unfortunately,
that people get caught up into ‘with the
politics of it,” he said. “For a prisoner,
the economic value is anywhere from
$26 -to $32 thousand and, in most
instances behind the lifer situation, I

believe they can run as high as $96

thousand per year in hospital care,
medication treatment, and so forth.
This is borne upon the taxpayers, of
which our families, the vast majority of

_us, having working members.”

state prison money is spent has

changed over the past few decades._He
said a “building spree” of prisons dur-
ing the l980s, with a renewed focus on
high security, played a large part in the
decrease or outright elimination of
vocational training and educational
programs for lifers. He commented
that, while it was “good for safety, it
was bad for programming,” since lifer
inmates had fewer and fewer produc-
tive activities to occupy their time.

When he came to prison in 1968,
David Myrick — age” 53, 36 years
served — had access to vocational
training in a welding or carpentry shop
and the possibility of earning his col-
lege degree. Today, younger lifers like
Bryan Turton (29, 7 years served) say
that even if he was pardoned, because
of the lack of training opportunities for
lifers, simply “pushing a mop” during
his years inside would ill prepare him
for maintaining a productive life in the
outside world. '

“Sometimes people lose focus to
how can any one of us men ever get to
show we’re remorseful for What we’ve
done,” Turton said. “I’m repenting in
the best way available to "us in this
institution, which isn’t much, because
when they came, they had the opportu-
nity to go to college. I didn’t have
none. No [general equivalency diplo-
ma] or nothing, and that’s it.” .

According to Diggs, it’s no coinci-
dence that the prison system is populat-
ed, by and large, by undereducated and
financially poor individuals — and that
it’s no mystery why they remain there.

“For the vast majority of us, we
had public defenders,” he said. “You’re
looking at the results, because of lack
of preparation, lack of defense and lack
of money to compete with the prosecu-
tion.”

“Thevaverage one of us has some
gist of the law some ten years later,
with regard to what was done to us and
how to go about it, and we are denied
access to courts,” he added.

For Kurt Grubschmidt, a local
attorney who attends Lifers
Association meetings, a system set up
to make freedom for Pennsylvania lif-
ers nearly impossible may make some
people sleep better at night.

But, he says, those same people

‘should be wary. »

“Well, they’d rather jail 10 inno-
cents than let one guilty go free,” he

said. “That fearthat you’ll have anoth-
' .A-' er "‘Mu"cl' Man,’ that you’ll let someone
' out and he’ll kill someone, it’s just

hobbled process,” he said.

“You know, my sister is a corporate
lawyer, and when I was first getting
into law, she gave me a good piece of
advice. She said, ‘Those doors to your
rights swing in two directions, and

some day you might end up on the
wrong side, and you want those doors
to work,”’ he added.

For lifers like Sullivan, maintain-
ing hope that one day he may walk free
beyond those doors keeps him focused
and, more importantly, sane.

“The only hope that a lifer has in
Pennsylvania is that he stays healthy,”
he said. “That’s the only hope he has.
Outside of that, legislators and all of
this, they have a lot of window dress-
ing, but almost after Milton Shapp left,
it seemed like all hope left. Hopefully,
Rendell will open the door again.”

“Lifers really are the backbone
here,” he added. “This probably

stretches across this state, but I know in
here, if it don’t be for some of the older
guys talking to some of the younger
guys, this joint would be under just
total chaos.”

For Diggs, outsiders should take

this positive social role for lifers with-‘

in the prison into consideration, instead
of dismissing all lifers as inherently
violent and unworthy of their freedom.

“You ask most anybody in the
[Department of Corrections] or [who
has] worked around prisoners for any

length of time, and they will tell you

lifers are the stabilizing force in
prison,” he said.
“Now, has it really gotten to the

point where you would really rather
have the lifers do the guards’ job?
Because if that’s the case, why not put
them out there, so they can raise and
change some of these kids on the
streets.”

Soon, because of state budget cuts,
facility age and overcrowding, SCI
Pittsburgh will close, and many
inmates will probably be transferred to
a new 672,000-square foot, 2,000-
inmate SCI—facility overlooking the
Monongahela River in Luzerne,
Fayette County. For lifers, it will be a
bus trip to continue a long wait within
new razor-wire—topped walls by the
shores of the river.

It’s not Google’s fault that hate sells

The Internet’s leading search
engine — and one of the English lan-
guage’s newest verbs — is embroiled
in controversy over offensive search
results.

Google “Jew” and the top search
result is a Web site called
Jewwatch.com, a clearinghouse of
anti-Semitic information and links.
Despite pressure from advocacy
groups to remove the site from its list-
ings, Google is not changing the
results.

The only time Google changes its
search results is when the sites advo-
cate illegal actions, such as pedophilia,
as in the case of a site called “Chester’s
guide to molesting young girls,” which
came up second on searches on the
English city of Chester.

Google works by implementing
complex algorithms based on the num-
ber and quality of links to a given site
— the sites with the best and most
other links on the Web rank highest in
the listings. Asking Google to remove
this particular site — odious as it may
be'— is unfair and wrongheaded.

If Google removes the site from
the listings, it will set a dangerous
precedent_ based on advocacy rather
than relying on its consistent, mathe-

' matical criteria. Every Web site has an

equal and fair chance to get listed high
on Google — each site can improve its

— tent.

content and visibility in its own way.
This should inspire Jewish-positive
sites to double their efforts to spread
their messages by having more sites
link to theirs.

No one _-— no one sane, anyhow —
is disputing that the site is hateful and
wrong. However, we live in a society
based upon certain freedoms; among
them is the freedom of speech. The site
is terrible, but Google is performing its
function perfectly by ranking it first ——
the site gets hits 'and is linked to.
Google’s job is to rank the Web, not
perform judgment calls upon its con-

Depending upon how the matter is
considered, it is a good thing that
Jewwatch.com is first -—— it draws

attention to how pervasive such dis-.

gusting sentiments are, and could have
a galvanizing effect on those who
would change that fact.

Google is the leading search
engine because it is consistent. The
results are reliable and without bias.
The search engine is beyond reproach
in this unfortunate situation.

Anyone with an objection needs to

understand‘ who is to blame. Google

isn’t responsible for anti-Semitism. No
one who isn’t alreadyanti-Semitic will
be swayed into hating ‘ Jews just

’because Google’s first option is

Jewwatch.com.

Why settle for great when you can make something better?

Strangely enough, I was eating a blueberry bagel
and drinking a hazelnut cappuccino while reading
Descartes when I noticed an issue of The Pitt News
opened to the Opinions Section.

It was the April 12 edition, and
I laid down my Descartes — if
only for a second — to find that I
was not only an obviously liberal

also maybe a homosexual.

This was not the first time I
contemplated my sexual orienta-
tion. I had been experimenting for
years now, but I never thought my

fine country, allow me to state my View of our United
States. -

You might be surprised to find that it does not
begin in a suburb of an American city, how-
ever. Nor does it ﬁnd its origins in liberal lit-
erature or youthful rebellion.

My experience with the United States
begins as a Bosnian refugee for two years,
sleeping on the ﬂoor of a dorm room—sized
area alongside my mom, brother and two
cousins whose parents remained in occupied
Sarajevo.

' Next to opening the door of our room one
day and unexpectedly seeing my dad stand-
ing there — for the first time since we got

revealing.

I could not stare the facts in the
eyes anymore and deny it. It is true — I am gay —
there can be no other explanation for my preference
for hazelnut cappuccinos.

Coming to terms with my sexuality, I moved to
the more pressing and important point of Christian
Brubaker’s column.

Constant critics of U.S. foreign policy, such as
myself, do not realize how wonderful this country is.
They are so preoccupied with criticizing the United
States that they neglect to recognize just how fortu-
nate they are to be citizens of a country that provides
them with liberties they would have few other places.

I have heard this claim before and have long
been accused of maintaining such a view. And
though I cannot speak for all devoted critics of our

word he was in a concentration camp — the
happiest moment of my life was hearing that
the United States of America had granted all of us
political asylum, regarding our case as serious and
worthy enough to welcome us into the country.
Coming off the plane, I literally fought with my

' cousin and brother to be the first to set foot on

American soil. I was 11 years old and knew what it
meant to be here.

Ten years, later, I have not forgotten. A year and .

a half ago, my then-15-year-old brother was diag-
nosed with cirrhosis of the liver. His condition
required an immediate liver transplant and, in the
Children’s Hospital here at UPMC, he underwent a
surgery that granted him a new liver and a new life.
The transplant could only have been provided in a
handful of places in the world — Bosnia, of course,

was not one of them.

I understand the greatness of our country; I’ve
lived it. I am acutely aware of not only that it is won-
derful, butwalso why it is wonderful and unique —
and I know so from personal experiences.

But I also understand its ﬂaws, and I do not think
that I should refrain from inquiring why we were
immediately involved in Kuwait and why we
allowed damn near a million people to die in Rwanda
just because I am.American.

Therefore, I harbor no illusions about our United
States — not because I do not realize how great she
is — but because I also realize how great she can be.

‘I suppose, every week, I could do some research
and talk about how Egypt’s, Russia’s or Paraguay’s
foreign policies are lacking. But only we are in the
position to use our tremendous power and inﬂuence
to direct the world; Zimbabwe’s ‘foreign policies are
not usually of global consequence — ours are.

Or instead of talking about what we can do bet-
ter, I could use my column to ‘praise our every move.
Then, we could all have more material to sit around
and masturbate to about just how great our great
United States is — to hell with what could be done to
make it even better.

If anyone needs reminding of why the United

States is great, point him or her in my direction.

Just don’t expect me to say she couldn’t be
greater.

There’s still a lot of important stuff to do in my one year left at Pitt

Last summer, I was in New York

now. That way if I have yet to accom- ‘me, I’m not after him for good conver-

City with three friends, en route to see a
taping of Jon Stewart’s “The Daily
Show.” This was no small feat -— it was
an event that had been three years in the.
making. It had taken such a long span of
time to coordinate all of our hectic
schedules to ensure that we’d all be able
to attend.

As we were parking our car I
announced,“‘It looks like we’re going
to accomplish a goal today.” After
laughing at that, I added, “It’s a shame
none of mine are career-oriented.” _

“Don’t worry,” one of my friends
chimed in, “all of my goals involve sex,
and, well  just sex.” We decided then
and there that goals, regardless of how
they’re oriented, were good to have.

Fast forward to the present. I’m
rapidly approaching the-‘ end of my
junior year and about to become a
senior. Graduation is just on,the horizon
— a thought that brings tears to the eyes
of this chick, despite the fact that I need
considerably more than a screening of
Disney’s “Bambi” to activate the water-
works. , ~ .

I’ve begun to realize that‘I’m run-
ning out of time here at Pitt, and there’s
still a ton of stuff I’ve been meaning to

ado, but haven’t gotten around.to yet. I

decided to write out my list of goals

one can really get on my
case and, at the risk of ,
sounding like my mother,
“get my rear in gear.”

Take in the view. Pitt
holds bragging, rights for
being home to the highest
educational structure in the
United States and the sec,-
ond highest in the world.
Yet‘ I’ ve ‘never been beyond

view at the pinnacle is sup-
posed to‘ be amazing. I
wouldn’t know, and I’ve been here
three years. I equate this with going to

Every day for three years, I’ve had
to torture myself by walking past the

Forbes Avenue, smelling the fine aroma
emanating from Scotty’sv makeshift
eatery. Everyone talks about how "great
the food is. For heaven’s sake, my dad
has eaten there several times, and it’s
not like he hangs out in Pittsburgh. I’m
totally “that girl” who uses her debit
card for everything ——- and never, ever
has cash. One day, I will take out some
dough, buy something guaranteed to
clog my arteries, and see for myself
what the fuss is all about.

These are a few of my goals to keep
myself busy in the next year. I encour-
age you to be like my mom and nag me
to death about getting these done —
ensuring that I leave my beloved Pitt
fulfilled in every way possible. Oh
yeah, getting that degree,I’ve paid so

What is sexy?

Victoria’s Secret poses this
question while their models with
unnatural, ice-blue eyes and jet-

black hair parade in the newest lin-

gerie like it isn’t unusual to be half-
naked with fake wings on your
back. Of course, we know this does-
n’.t portray real life. Most people
will neverihave those body dimen-
sions, intensive make—up work or be
comfortable strutting around ‘ in a
bra, panties and high heels. It’s just
another Victoria’s Secret ad, and
that’s allthat stays with us, espe-
cially since the fashion show was
cancelled. Right? - .
Not lately. On television nowa-
"days, plastic surgery seems to be
the new pink, and not just for
Hol1ywood’s ‘hottest celebrities.
Now there are plastic surgery shows
for everyone.

A couple’ of years ago, I.remem—
ber spending my summer mornings
watching “A Personal Story” on
TLC. It ‘was a modest show that fol-
lowed one person’s journey as he or

she made the decision to get plastic
surgery. They were just the basic
procedures — a boob job, a nose job,
a tummy tuck as a reward
for losing massive
amounts of weight. In the
end, the patients were
happy with their new body
parts and ‘chock-full of
new self-esteem. ,

If “A Personal Story”
was‘, the McDonald’s
Happy Meal of shows
about plastic surgery, the
reality shows on televi-
sion today that center on
this fad are super-sized.

MTV had an impres-
sive “True Life” episode
about breast enlargements”
and reductions, completely uncen-
sored, giving viewers more nipple
shots than the dozens of replays of

 

the Janet Jackson Super Bowl inci-I

dent. It was about the struggle that
went with the decision to get plastic
surgery, the emotional commitment
and the real danger of going under

  

Now MTV has a new show
called. “I Want a __Famous Face”
which centers on plastic
surgery in order to look
like celebrities, a new
phenomenon MTV
uncovered. These peo-
ple want to look like
Kate 'Winslet, Britney
Spears, Jennifer Lopez,
Pamela Anderson - and
what’s faster than hav-
ing major surgery?
MTV shows the graphic
slicing and dicing that
comes with it, although
now the nipples are
triple pixilated.

The girl who wants
to be like Pamela Anderson had her
boobs done so large that even
Playboy hesitated to hire her
because they looked unnatural on

her small frame. However, MTV-

doesn’t address the larger issue.

they’ll change their bodies just to
be one step closer?

But the problem is that they are
not the only ones. Plenty of people
in America let fame and airbrushing
define their standards of beauty.
Now that low-carb weight loss is in
style, food commercials have added
how few carbohydrates their prod-
ucts have to be more enticing to
customers. Subway has a whole
menu created around the latest
craze, and Jared doesn’t even
receive a mention.

The quest for the perfect body
— defined face, big boobs, flat
stomach, small waist, shapely butt,
small thighs — is further perpetuat-
ed by extreme makeover shows and
Simon on “American Idol” telling
the contestants they sing well, but
they need to lose weight.

One show that capitalizes on the
insecurities of most American
women is the new Fox reality show

‘‘Schindler’s List’’ DVD
Starring Liam Neeson, Ralph
Fiennes, Ben Kingsley

Directed by Steven Spielberg
7,“n’.‘ni‘r

\“Schindler’s List” is a film that
fans have de1nanded‘be released on
DVD since the inception of the
technology. Now, years after a num-
ber of the most requested titles have
been released —- “The Godfather”
films and the “Indiana Jones” trilo-

‘gy, and the first three"“Star Wars”

movies will be released later this
year — “Schindler’s List” has final-
ly seen the light of DVD day.

But the result is a little disap-
pointing.

From the technical end, the film
onits own makes the DVD worth
buying. Steven Spielberg’s master-
work is as powerful as it was when
it was first released. The_story of a
man’s redemption and the struggle
for survival within the confines of a
Nazi concentration camp during
World War II is one that will always
resonate, thanks to Spielberg’s

,......--.~.,~.~-..v .~.~~..-.......--.-.—.-....-..-....-~....-~.. $.~»‘4l

rs

meticulous direction and the stark
black—and—wh/ite cinematography‘,

/ which looks better than ever. And

the detailed, disturbing sound of the

film ——- the dogs, the screams, the
bullet—crack coming from the
Lugers — is equally as powerful

thanks to DVD’s ability to bring
those details to life.

All ofnthe elements that made
“Schindler’s List” an instant classic
when it was released make it a.film
that should have a place on your
DVD shelf right next to “The
Pianist.” But it’s not a DVD worth
buying for its extra content. V

There are only two extras to
speak of, “Voices from the Past”
and ‘.‘The Shoah Foundation Story
with Steven Spielberg.” The
“Voices from the Past” feature is an
8i)-minute documentary featuring
many of the living survivors of the
Holocaust saved by Oskar
Schindler. It’s an excellent feature
that provides viewers a more com-

Chronophonic brings the funk with a jazzed-up release

Footwork
Chronophonic
Self released

Recommended if you like:
Funky, jazzy hip-hop

Everything’s bigger in —
Colorado? Musical interludes and
jam sessions, that is. Welcome to

V Footwork, the sophomore effort of the

Colorado.-based eight-piece,

Chronophonic. _
Described as having a
jazz/funk/hip-hop , r sound,

Chronophonic is a breath of fresh air
frommainstream music. Citing major
artistic inﬂuences ranging from
Radiohead to , James Brown,
Chronophonic unleashes a rarely
heard sound with Footwork — whichpis
a nice change of pace from the main-
stream, ditzy, bubble—gum divas and
uber-tattooed pop-punk bands.

iWith only 11 tracks spanning the
nearly one-hour running time,
Footwork is full of long jams that
would put The Doors to shame. Three
tracks are full—blown instrumentals —
each with a unique sound. “Deep
Puddin’, Pt. 1” shows off drummer
Jim Fierro’s mastery of percussion,
while Jon Stone’s guitar playing on

“Outro” is very Santana-esque.

On the title track, the vocal duo
of Jon Piazza and Jake Sanders break
it down a la Busta Rhymes. With swift
delivery and impeccable ﬂow, they
rap: “I roam the earth in motion with
breeze / composing these symphonies
/ silencing any eyeing me with ill
intent / your stolen styles frozen by
the swift spoken Frisco resident.”

“Bean So Hot,”. one of the
album’s niost distinct songs, is a
roller-coaster ride of tempo. While
both Vocalists deliver the line: “The
ending of life is just some kids clap-
ping their toys / balloons pop in this
hot atmosphere,” a metal guitar rift
cuts into the flow. A minute later,
however, things slow down again,
only to pick up later in the song. ‘But
don’t be mistaken; this track is one of
the gems of the album. ‘i

Currently in the process of pro-
moting. the new album, Chronophonic
has booked nearly 20 shows in the
next three months. But there’s a catch
—— all shows are in Colorado. Unless
you want to take a road trip or ﬂy west
this summer, the safe bet might be to
hop onto www.cdstreet.com or head
to the store and pick up Footwork. It’s
worth the cash and will refreshingly

C jazz up your record collection.

MTV and FOX work hard to make women feel ugly

Alston, page 9

who auditioned, 17 lucky ladies
were considered the ugliest and
asked to participate on the show.
Each week, two of them will go
head to head — and under the knife
— as a team of cosmetic surgeons, a
dentist, a fitness trainer, a therapist
and life coach discuss what makes
the woman need their expertise so
badly.

The most interesting part of
the show isn’t the plastic surgery.
You can see that anywhere. It’s the
low self—esteem of the contestants.
No wonder other people think the
contestants aren’t good-looking
when it’s written all over their face
that they believe the same thing.

That’s a larger issue than chin lipo-
suction. Fox does have a therapist
and a life coach to help the contes-
tants with their mental beauty. But
in the end, every reality show is a
contest.

After the dramatic transforma-
tions through plastic surgery, dental
work, visits to the dermatologist
and working out with a physical
trainer every day to drop the
weight, one girl is deemed les.s pret-
ty than the other and rejected once
again. The winner goes on to com-
pete in their beauty pageant where
there will only be one winner. So
the cycle continues, and it seems
even harder to achieve that body or

look that’ll suddenly make life’

wonderful.

Rarely are people immune to
these messages, no matter how
much we are disgusted or bewil-
dered by the lengths people will go
to achieve someone else’s defini-
tion of beautiful. Even while watch-
ing “The Swan,” I examined myself
in the mirror and wondered if I
needed some face liposuction to go
with the thighs. I don’t think I’ll be
applying ..for the show any time
soon though. Wanting to lose some
weight, wear make-up that Halle
Berry advertises, lift weights to
increase bicep size — those are nor-
mal desires that everyone has,
whether they get around to it or not.
But this growing obsession with the
perfect body that makes plastic

is worrisome. Besides, even hair-
cuts can be dramatic.
It’s hard not to want to have the

fabulous life that VH1 tells us our

favorite celebrities have or the
knockout body that’ll have Justin

_Timberlake knocking" on the door.

Even after the breast implants and
losing 30 pounds while shouting
“TRIMSPA, baby!” the truth is that
Justin probably still won’t come
around. Maybe that’s just my fanta-
sy. Still the decision to do any of

p these things has to be about you.

The mosteffective makeover is
to have the kind of confidence ‘and
self—esteem that’ll get you through
the day without going crazy! After
that, dealing with everything else
seems a little_ easier.

DVD extras disappoint on this classic

Schindler, page 10

“The Shoah Foundation Story”
gives those fans of the film inspired
to help those survivors of the
Holocaust a look at the Shoah
Foundation, started by Spielberg
after the completion of the film.
Shoah is an organization committed
to “overcome prejudice, intolerance
and bigotry — and the suffering
they cause — through the educa-
tional use of the foundation’s visual
history testimonies.” Like “Voices,”
“The Shoah Foundation‘ Story” is a
feature that gives viewers more
insight into the impact “Schindler’s
List” has had on Spielberg and the
world. '

But that’s it.

Where’s the in-depth look at the
making of the film? Where are the
interviews with the actors that give

insight into what the experience
was like working on the film and
how it affected them?

These things aren’t present on
the DVD, and it suffers for it. Two
of the beauties of DVD technology
are giving filmmakers the ability to
present their films in the best way
possible, both in terms of picture
quality and sound, and the extra
features that give viewers the
behind—the~scenes look at the film.

The “Schindler’s List” DVD
only follows through on the first
half of the technology’s promise —
a disappointment considering how
greatly anticipated this DVD was.
But the film itself, one of the ‘best
films of the ‘90s and one of the
most powerful films in the history
of American cinema, makes the
DVD a must-own.

JIMMY JOHNSON
Staff Writer

The Pitt women’s tennis team extended
its losing streak to four games over the week-
end with two losses to non-conference oppo-
nents — Bucknell and Army.

As result, the Panthers will remain 2-3

, in the Big East, but fall to 10-6 overall.

Bilcknell 4, Pitt 3

It was three straight victories in the mid-
dle of the singles matches that gave the
Bison a 4-3 win over the Panthers On Friday
in Lewisburg, Pa.

Panthers Becky Emmers, Annie Davies
and Hayley Hughes all fell in the second,
third and fourth singles matches. "Emmers
was defeated in straight sets, 7-6(4) and 60,
by Bucknell’s Veronica Brown. 9

Davies put up a ﬁght winning the ﬁrst
set 7-6 (2) over Nadezda Cmeic. But Curcic
fought back and won the ﬁnal two sets 6-4
and 6-3 to tie the overall score at two,

The Panthers had a 2-0 lead, fueled by a
win in the ﬁrst singles match by Laura
Pegula and by winning two out of three dou-
bles matches. ,- »

After losing the ﬁrst doubles match,
Pitt’s Davies and Hayley Hughes battled to
win the second match 8-6, over Bucknell’s
Curcic and Mills. The match point was
awarded after Emmers and Danielle
Shuttleworth partnered up to defeat Brown
and Berthod 8-6. -

Davies was the only Panther to collect a

9 win on Saturday against Army in Lewisburg,

Pa. The rest of the Panthers did not have the
same luck, as they found themselves being

swept in all three doubles matches, giving
Army the early 1-0 lead. Pegula and Emily
Hughes paired up in an 8-1 loss to Marissa

- Limsiaco and Noble.

Army’s Melanie Bundoc and Ali del
Moral worked together to defeat Davies and
‘I-Iayley Hughes in the second doubles match
8-3. Emmers and Shuttleworth lost the third
doubles match 8-2 to Amanda Paluch and
Pam Chavez.

Army then continued to dominate the
Panthers, jumping out to a 3-0 lead after
winning the ﬁrst two singles matches, when
Pegula and Emmers both fell in straight sets
of two.

After Davies cut the lead to 3-1, Army
came back to sweep the ﬁnal three singles
matches to walk away with a victory over
Pitt Emily Hughes and Jude were the only
Panthers, other than Davies, to win at least
one set during the singles competition.

The Panthers will look to get back to
.500 in the Big East when they take on West
Virginia University at home on Friday at

12:30 p.m.

NBA Playoffs
are just around
the corner

 

With one game left to go in the
NBAseasOn, here are three predictions
for the 2004 NBA postseason:

1. The New York Knicks will Win a
playoff series. ,

This is Obviously a biased pick, but
the Knicks are catching the New Jersey
Nets at just the right time. The Nets
have just not been the same without
Jason Kidd in their lineup, and there are
no prospects for Kidd’s return in the
near feature. And the injury problems
don’t stop there for the Nets, as Kenyon
Martin re-injured his left knee late last
week against the Orlando Magic.
Martin will most likely play in the ﬁrst
round of the playoffs, but there is no
telling how effective he will be.

Meanwhile, the Knicks have won
three in a row and ﬁve of their last
seven. The New York squad, which has
been overhauled numerous times this
year, is ﬁnally starting to gel at just the
right time. '

And, most importantly, the Knicks
are winning as a team..Over their last
ﬁve games, the Knicks have had six
different leading scorers (DerMarr
Johnson and Tim Thomas tied each
other with 20 points each in an April 10
win at Washington).

When Moochie Norris is a threat to
go for 21, you know that there is some
ball distribution going on. And that
does not bode well for a banged-up
New Jersey team.

There is still an outside chance of
the Knicks stealing the sixth playoff
spot, but Lenny Wilkens wiTl‘ber\esting
most of his starters in the Knicks clos-
ing regular season game at Cleveland.

Meanwhile, the Hornets have to
choke against the Wizards to ‘slip to No.
7. That’s not likely, so I am sticking
withtthis matchup and this pick.

Kincaid emerged as a solid team

KEVIN NASH
Assistant Sports Editor

Coming into the 2003-04 Pitt women’s basketball
season, senior forward Latoya Kincaid averaged 11 min-
utes per game and 3.1 points, but this past season, her
role changed drastically -—- she emerged as the team
leader.

' Kincaid, a Pensacola Junior College transfer in 2002,
led the Panthers in five categories this past season: points
per game, rebounds, steals, shooting percentage and free
throw _percentage. '

As a result of some of these accomplishments,
Kincaid has been named The Pitt News Female Athlete of
the Winter. Another accolade that she received was
Honorable Mention All Big East. 4

“I didn’t [expect to be the team leader],” Kincaid
said. “I came in and tried to help my team, and I wasn’t
worried too much about trying to be the main player.”

iThis season, she averaged 14.4 points per game and
7.3 rebounds.

To go along with the previous categories, Kincaid
shot 75.4-percent from the charity stripe, came up with 31
steals and shot 44.3 percent fromthe field.

“You can always call her number,” Pitt women’s bas-
ketball head coach Agnus Berenato said. “She’s really
made my experience very pleasurable, and I’m sorry I

leader for Panthers last season

player. Even though her role was unexpected, she met the

‘challenge head-on.

“I accepted the challenge, and I knew that they were
depending on me,” Kincaid said. “So I knew I had to
work harder and do better than I had been.”

Her most memorable moment of the season was when
the Panthers won their first Big East contest of the sea-
son. ~ - '

Pitt took on Seton Hall, and Berenato put Kincaid on
the bench. _

Before being benched, Kincaid scored only two
points, but when she finally returned to the game, she
erupted for 27 points, which gave her a career-high 29
points for the game. The Panthers went on to beat Seton
Hall 61-56.

“It was our first win, and we all came together,”
Kincaid said. “Everybody started to have confidence in
each other.” .

She credits the Seton Hall game as the turning point

By his own high
standards; sophomore
diver Dennis Nemtsanov
called this season a dis-
appointment. .

But in reality,
Nemtsanov had a
remarkable year and,
‘ because of his achieve-
ments, is being recog-
nized by The Pitt News
as Male Athlete of the
Winter.

Despite a shoul-
der injury that both-
ered him all season,
Nemtsanov captured first
place 13 times this season.
Nemtsanov earned two
All-Big East honors with a
score of 314.20 and a first-
place finish in
the one-meter
springboard
and a score of
479.10 and

in East Meadow, N.Y. He also became the first
non-Miami Big East diving champion since
Pitt’s John Sharkey in 1991. I

His success continued at the NCAA Zone ‘A’
Diving Pre-quals at the U.S. Naval Academy in
Annapolis, Md., where he won the one-meter
springboard with a total score of 608.4.

Nemtsanov also qualified for the NCAA
Championships in three-meter springboard with
a third-place finish and 492.4 points and quali-
fied for the platform with a fourth-place finish
and 431.6 points.

Nemtsanov is the only Panther diver to qual-
ify for the NCAA championships in either of the
last two seasons.

At the NCAA Championships in East
Meadow, N.Y., March 25 Nemtsanov earned All-
American honors with 294.2 points and an 11th
place finish in the one-meter springboard.

Nemtsanov, who also finished 11th last year
on the platform as a freshman, became the first
Panther diver since J_ohn Soulakis to earn at least
Honorable Mention All—American status more
than once. Soulakis was a two-time Honorable
Mention All-American and a two-time All-
American.

Nemtsanov did not fare as well on the three-
meter springboard, where he finished’34th with a
score of 240.95, or on the platform where he fin-

ished last behind 23 competitors. -

The shoulder that he had surgery on last May
and hampered him during the~regular season was
clearly bothering him.

“That definitely cost him,” Big East diving
Coach of the Year Julian Krug said. “The three-
meter and platform are his better events. The
higher you go up, the more stress you put on
your shoulder.” I

With all of Nemtsanov’s accomplishments,
the shoulder injury made him perform at a level
lower than he had hoped.

“I thought last season was better than this
one,” he said. “But considering the injury, the
season was a success.”

Nemtsanov says that the shoulder is not
bothering him much now and will not slow his
plans for an off—season filled with aggressive
training.

Both Nemtsanov and Krug expect the shoul-
der to be 100 percent by next season, and both
have. big expectations looking ahead to next
yean

“He can’t really do much better in the reg_u-
lar season,” Krug said, “I would like‘ him to be in

. the top eight [at the NCAA Championships] in

one of the events and be an All-American.”

“I want to finish in the top eight in all three
competitions at the NCAA Championships,”
Nemtsanov, said. “I also want to win the three
competitions attire Big East Championships.”

Fitzgerald is top choice for EA
Sports’ “NCAA Football 2005”

RYAN WALKER
Senior Staff Writer

While no one knows which NFL
uniform Larry Fitzgerald will wear
next season, Electronic Arts has
decided to feature the former Pitt
wide out on the cover of “NCAA
Football 2005.”

Fitzgerald finished a close sec-
ond behind quarterback Jason White
of Oklahoma in the Heisman Trophy
balloting and ‘is currently rated by
many as the top player in this year’s
NFL draft.

Fitzgerald figures to be among
the first players selected on April 24.

Last year, “NCAA Football
2004” sold 1.6 million copies, mak-
ing it the second best-selling foot-
ball video game, behind only
“Madden NFL 2004.”

‘f1t’s a huge honor to represent
“NCAA Football 2005,” since this is
the game we always played in the
locker room,” Fitzgerald said in a
statement. “To grace the cover of the
most intense and exciting college

football video game is a dream come
true for me. I am fired up to be part
of the EA Sports family.”

In just two seasons as a Panther,
Fitzgerald broke numerous school,
conference and national records. He
shattered the previous record for
consecutive games with a touch-
down by finding the end zone in 18
straight contests. -

Fitzgerald also became the first
sophomore ever to win the Walter
Camp Player of the Year Award.
Additionally, he was a unanimous
choice for All-American and won
the Biletnikoff Award, which is
given annually to the country’s top
receiver.

For the first time in any football
video game, “NCAA Football 2005”
will feature a true home-field advan-
tage, where game—day atmosphere
will directly impact players’ perfor-
mance on the field. 1

“NCAA Football 2005” is sched-
uled to ship in July and will be avail-
able on PlayStation 2, Xbox, and the
Nintendo GameCube.

Spurs and Pacers will likely, win their respectiveconferences and play in finals  

Cunningham, page 15

2. Sacramento will not make it out of

the first round. _
Ifl had made this pick three months
ago, I would have been laughed out of

the building, but with the way the Kings

have been playing lately, it doesn’t
seem so far—fetched. «

The Kings have lost seven of their
last eleven games, including losses to
the ' Lakers, the Mavericks, the
Timberwolves and the Nuggets. Bobby
Jackson is injured, and Chris Webber’s
return has been disastrous. Webber is
obviously not healthy enough to be
playing, andlhe is only hurting his team
bygstaying on the ‘court.

Atthis point, I don’t think it even
matters who the Kings play in the first
round. Houston and Memphis both
match up very well against Sacramento,
and Dallas seems to have the Kings’
number. The Kings just don’t look like
an elite basketball team, and until they
can once again run the offense success-
fully through Peja Stoj akovic, the depth
of the Western Conference will rear its
ugly head. i

3. The Spurs and the Pacers will meet
in the NBA Finals.

If you look closely at the Western
Conference, there are really three teams
that have legitimate shots at making the
Finals. The Mavericks cannot play
defense and have slipped into near
obscurity, and the Kings’ unexpected
late,-season collapse, since Chris
Webber’s return, means neither team
has much of a shot. The lower-level
teams in the West just don’t have the
ﬁrepower to get the job done. Memphis
and ‘Denver are great stories, but they
are‘ young and have no playoff experi-
ence. Houston has a nice combination

’ of wily Veterans and young athletes, but

they are too Streaky.

That leaves the Lakers, the
Timberwolves and the Spurs. When
they are healthy, the Lakers are the best
team in the NBA. Their veteran leader-
ship "and ability to win in the clutch is
unparalleled, and Shaq and Kobe are
still two of the best players in the NBA.
The key is that “when they are healthy”
part. Considering the increased intensi-

.ty that the playoffs present and their

physical styles of play, I don’t see Karl

Malone and Shaq staying healthy for
four straight playoff series. Without
their four-headed-NBA-future-Hall-of-
Famer monster, the Lakers are merely
and above-average team. -

The Timberwolves will be a hot
playoff pick. They have a great inside-
out game, and they play wonderful
defense.. Kevin Garnett can take over
the game almost single-handedly, but
he doesn’t need to anymore thanks to
Latrell Sprewell and Sam Cassell.

They also will have a lot of pressure
on them to win, which is something that
they are not used to. This is their first
season with a top-three seed, and I think
that they will wilt as a result.

Give this team a couple of years,
but now is not their time. _

The Spurs are the defending NBA
champions. They have won ten games
in a row.

They still have an outside shot at a
No. 1 seed. And, like the Lakers, the
Spurs seem to bring out their best for
the playoffs. Tim Duncan" will earn
postseason MVP honors once again,
and the Spurs will win their third NBA
championship in six years,

The Eastern Conference is, in a
word, horrible. This makes it a much
easier call.

Indiana is so well coached. Rick
Carlisle has turned the Pacers around

and, most importantly, he has Ron

Artest under control. Jermaine O’Neal

just seems to keep getting better, and Al
Harrington is the best sixth man in the
NBA.’And of course, Reggie Miller has
been known to hit a clutch playoff shot
or two (arrrrghl).

With 60 wins, the Pacers will have
home-court advantage throughout the
playoffs. And there is not another team
in the Eastern Conference that can beat
them at the Conseco Fieldhouse and
defend home court. ‘
