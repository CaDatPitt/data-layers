Area Thinking Graduation Theme

Development

Education

Curriculum Continued

By Graduate

School

The role of education in underdeveloped countries is
the theme of the University’s Graduate Study in Interna-
tional and Development Education. This program, begun in

1963, was given a ﬁve—year

Ford Foundation grant two

years ago.

Development education includes‘
research aimed at a comprehen-
sive understanding of the role of
educational institutions in rapid-
ly changing societies; practical or
applied research analyzing devel-
opment education problems in
speciﬁc settings and suggesting
hypotheses for action by educa-
tional planners; and interpretive
research synthesizing the results
of practical and basic research
into forms which can be widely
disseminated for the layman, the
general policy planner and the
professional teacher.

‘,‘Emerging nations know that
the key to long-term economic
and social development is the ed--
ucation of their people,” said
Vice-Chanchellor of the Profes-
sions A. C. Van Dusen. ,

“The graduate program doesn’t
prepare students to teach,” ac-
cording to Seth Spaulding, asso-
ciate professor of education and
zoordinator of the International
Education Programs. “It prepares
educational administrators, teach-

er educators, higher educational
personnel and planning officials.”

Next year’s expanded course
offerings in International and De-
velopment Education will be
taught by John Singleton, from
the East-West Center in Hawaii,

and Paul Watson, from the Uni-,i

versity of Quito, Ecuador.

Community cooperation
were the by—word at Mon-
day’s Commencement on the
Cathedral Lawn. “We must
re-examine our responsibil-
ities to the community,”
urged Acting Chancellor David
Kurtzman,” And we must look
beyond our own responsibilities to
the resonsibilities of the com-
munity.”

The main speaker was the head
of Pittsburgh college, Dr. H. Guy-

Professor

Suggests
End of Finals

Beach, Cal., has suggested some-
thing to his fellow educators that
students have been proposing for
years—an end to ﬁnal examina-
tions.

Without ﬁnals, grades could be
based on “not less than three
demonstrations of competency by
the students,” according to Mil-
ler. He also feels that this would
allow more time to spend on in-
structional time in the classroom.

With strong student support,

the school’s Faculty. Senate for
approval this week.

Professor Harold T. Miller of‘
California State College in Long -~

the proposal will be presented to‘

, ford Stever, president of Carnegie

Institute of Technology. (also the
recipient of an honorary Doctor
of Laws.) The other honorary de-
gress went to Pittsburghers: Frank
Magee, Sidney P. Mparland and
William H. Rea.

“We are proud of the fact that
they are all Pittsburgher,” stated
Dr. Kurtzman. “Although we have
no intention of becoming limited
to this region,” he explained, “We
cannot fulfill the dreams of this
University without the help and
cooperation of these community
leaders.”

In his opening remarks, the
Acting Chancellor suggested se-

Computer
Techniques

Now Taught

In the fall a new experimental
course, “The Application of Com-
puter Techniques to Humanistic
Research,” will be offered to
graduate students.

The three credit course, devel-
oped” by Professors Nuel Belnap
Of the philosophy department and
Alan Markman of the English de-
partment will be taught by Pro-
fessor Markman Tuesdays from 1
to 3:50 p.m.

The two major objectives of
the course are to familiarize stu-
dents with the capabilities a.nd
limitations of the digital com-
puter for research in the human-
ities;and to use the computer by
Weparing simple programs and

analyzing existing programs,

veral ‘steps for this regional orien-
tation. He explained that for the
ﬁrst time the University was hav-
ing regular meetings with its four
sister institutions in the area,
forming a Pittsburgh council of
higher education.

' Dr. Stever joked that Tech was
trying its best to cooperate too.
Rain had sprinkled on his school’s
graduation in the morning, but
the sun was shining at Pitt's in
the afternoon.

Most of Dr. Stever’s fairly brief
speech left the topic of regional
cooperation, and deli: with the
need for graduates to have a con-
tinuing interest in education.
While he was sure most of the
2,675 graduates were “delighted
to get away”’ he reminded them
of their duty toward education
throughout the rest of their lives.

“You will ﬁnd yourselves as
citizens puzzling out how your
community should spend its re-

sources on education,-”!he contin-i ,
ued “And at a later time you will-

be deeply involved in helping your
own children plan their education-
al programs.”

The -Tech President attacked

those who claimed specialization
in education had gone too far. Dr.
Stever said that “in any area of
intellectual endeavor that one
might single out, a long list of the
advances for society have come
as a result of specialization.”
_ 'He claimed that institutes of
technology like his own do have
“about the components of general
educations as to liberal
schools, and the great universi.
ties.”

“We accidentally stumbled across Cough1in’s work last
December,” commented Marianne McWil1iams, a petite
brownette who works in the Fine Arts department of the
University Bookstore. Because he is a master at graphic
art work, we have chosen his pictures for our June-July
art exhibit.”

Jack Coughlin, a Fine Arts teacher at the University
of'Massachusetts, has contributed 49 etchings, lithographs

and woodcuts for the present monthly exhibit of the Book-

 = .. .- store. Besides dealing with hu-
man and animal ﬁgures, he has
made numerous studies of owls:
cameo portraits of owls, full
bodied pictures of owls, and owls
in context with other ﬁgures.

Since 1961, Coughlins work has
been exhibited in 14 New Eng-
land group shows, and seven one-
man shows, including those at
the University of Massachusetts,
Washburn University in Kansas,
and Hinckley and Brohel Gallery
in New York. He has also won
ten awards and'prizes for print-
making, and etching.

Coughlin’s etchings and litho-
graphs have been well received
at the Bookstore. He has sold 50
since December, including 15 on
the first day of the June exhibit.

Dean Billick
To Direct
New Image

The Athletic Department
has been undergoing some
major facelifting operations
during the past year and Frank
Carver added the ﬁnishing touch-
es last week when he announced
the appointment of Dean Billick
to the position of Sports Informa-
tion Director.

Billick, who has occupied a sim-
ilar position at Bucknell since
last October, replaces B e ano
Cook. Cook resigned his position
at Pittin order to join the Amer-
ican Broadcasting Company last
February. 1

A resident of .Grove City, Bil-
lick will move into his new of-
fice on July 1st.

The new Panther publicist grad-
uated from Penn State in 1963
with a Bachelor of Arts degree
and a major in journalism. While
at State, he served as Sports Edi-
tor of the “Daily Collegian.”

Billick has worked on the news
staff of the Sharon Herald for
four years and following his re-
lease from the Army he was ap
pointed News Editor of the “Cen-
ter Daily Times” at State College.
From there he went to Bucknell.

Only 25 ye a r s old, Billick’s
youth will place him right in the
mood of things at the Athletic De-
partment, in light of the youthful
outlook of the new football staff.
Assistant coach Dick Bestwick
was Billick’s high school coach at
Grove. City.

Billick’s attitude also seems to
capture the main flow of conver-
sation coming from the Field
House these days. '

solid image with the public by

GRIDDERS SIGNED
Dave Hart’s recruiting drive
has ﬁnally come to a close. In
his first year as head football

coach, Hart and his staff sign-

ed 33 boys to letters of intent.
All except for seven are from
Pennsylvania. Included among
next year’s freshmen are five
ends, four tackles, four guards,
.three centers, and 17 backs_

THE POWER for this ycar’s baseball team was provided by junior
Steve Kienzl. His .304 batting average was the second highest on the
team. His four" home runs helped to drive in nine runs. Shortstop
Kienzl’s performance was quite a change from last year when he
only lmtted .179, with one home run and one run batted in. Maybe
his" average will continue to go up next year.

“Of course this means football,
but it also includes all the other

When he arrives here, Billick’s
first task will be to put out a new

but after I get the guide out of
the way, I hope to get to ‘know
