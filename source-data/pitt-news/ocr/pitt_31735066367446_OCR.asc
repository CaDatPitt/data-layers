students answered in various ways:

Barbara Eggers, N. Y., Arts, fr. “Because I have
to pay for my own education, the raise will make

it harder for me. But out-of-staters should become
aware of the many scholarships that the University
oﬁers them.” '
Steve Leidhold, N. Y., Arts, soph. “It acts as a
damper on school spirit"since most of it (spirit)
is inspired by out-of-state students."
Tom Leonard, N. 1., Arts, fr. “I think that

encouraging out-of-state students. The raise will
not affect my return to Pitt next year, but it
deﬁnitely will in two years when the tuition will
probably be hiked again.”
Robert Smith, Arts, fr. “I was most surprised
that the University would raise its tuition rates by
such a large amount as six dollars a credit hour in
one strike. _
“Considering what the University has to offer

To Conduct

Sophomores ‘in the University’s
School of Medicine will gain prac-
tical experience of how housing

and environmental conditions af-
fect health by conducting a health
survey during the next 30 days in
the city of Pittsburgh.

This practical experience will
enable the students preparing for
medicine, not only to gain knowl-
edge of their community but also
to learn how to assess health of
groups. M

Approximately 60 members of
the class will be surveying 600
Pittsburgh households to assess
the health of the members of these
homes. Other members of the
class will be checking records of
voluntary health agencies and
various community health organi-
zations, and other students will re-
view past surveys.

The Allegheny County Health
Department is cooperating in the
survey by giving these student
surveyors p r o p e r credentials.

Econoztiics Professor States Diﬁerenees

Yugoslavian Evaluates
American Universities

By IVIARILN ASHKENAS
One of the most striking differences between the system
of Education in American universities and those in Yugo-
slavia is that in Yugoslavia you don’t have to pay to go to

college.

This was recently stated by Momir Cecez, a professor of

....,li.'conomics from Sarajevo, Yugoslavia, who is now attending

the University for one semester?

to study the economy of the;
United States. g

Visiting the U. S. for about one§
year, he will spend the next two
semesters in two other univer-
sities also studying economics.

Study Free

Professor Cecez went on to say
that in his own country there are
no private schools. Everyone is
given the opportunity to go to
school for free and to study what-
ever he wishes. ,

"But,” he said, “a student ‘
that wants to study law has to
go to an institution that spe-
cializes in that subject and take
all the courses that are re-
quired.”

Cecez also said that a professor
in his country is given an’out-
line to follow in his course and
he has to teach it accordingly. ‘At
the University,” he said, “a pro-
fessor can teach his course any-
way he wants to.”

Classes Larger

He also said that he noticed a
much closer relationship between
the faculty and students. “In
Yugoslavia, we have larger
classes, like your lectures, and
we have none of these smaller
seminar classes."

“But your courses require
much more literature for the
students to read. In our subjects
there are only one or two books

which the student has to read
for the course.”

When asked which system he
thought was superior, he said:
“Each system has its merits. Al-
though we 'may have a larger
scientiﬁc knowledge, you have a
better speciﬁc and general knowl-

ed'g.e.9,
Books Censored

Professor Cecez also said that
there is complete freedom of the
press in Yugoslavia. “We have
many books from the United
States that are translated into our
own language. Of course, each
country has its own policy on cen-
sorship. You cannot expect to al-
low the publication of an article
that goes against the people and

Plans for a major reor-

formation of a new hospital
which will incorporate the
University’s medical facilities.

The new hospital will be organ-

Arneson Wants to Expand Work in Africa

Cultural Exchange Director
Talks of Unbalanced Program

By TOM BRYANT

The present U. S. cultural exchange programs tend to be
“one way affairs,” according to R. Gordon Arneson, Director
of the Oﬁice of Cultural Exchange of the State Department.
E Arneson spoke at a press conference last Thursday af-

ternoon in Bruce Hall.

Each year, ﬁve foreign visitors enter the United States

to every one American that studies
or works abroad. Arneson said
that many countries cannot afford
to pay travel expenses of visitors
as the United States does; conse-
quently, there is an imbalance of
the exchange ration. .

Africa has emerged as a new

land challenging area and Arneson
"states that his office would like to

increase the exchange program
‘with these many small countries.
In the past, organizing pro-
grams was diﬁicult because the
-U.S. had to negotiate through
colonial governments of Bel-
gium and England. Since many
African nations have recently
gained their independence, fu-

‘_ ture exchange programs will be

'more easily undertaken.

Arneson feels that the United
States shouldn‘t completely neg-
lect the European nations as some
experts have suggested. “Cultural
exchanges between countries that
think alike are just as important
as between countries that differ,”
he concluded.»

Arneson hopes that the new
Kennedy administration w i l l
strengthen exchange programs
and expand into new, undevel-
oped areas. He feels that be-
cause the era of exchange pro-

E grams is just beginning, it is
very important that the U.S. en-
courage countries such -as Ni-

" geria to exchange not only with

the United States, but with other
African countries.

Arneson was appointed as Di-
rector of the Office of Cultural
Exchange in September, 1960. He
is a graduate of North Dakota
State College and has served in

the defense, state, and war depart-

ments.

 acolumn written by the Pitt News’ former editor. In this
acdlumn she had questioned the ethical standards of most of

 administrators. Also in that issue of the Pitt News, the
‘falter-t reader could quickly detect one of the situations that
ihad concerned her. ' ’ A

~ _ On the front page of the paper was the statement of
the vice chancellor of student affairs concerningthe lack
of a policy on discrimination at the University because their
‘position was clear. On the last page of the same issue was a
statement of the Dean of Students. He said that the separate
housing for negroes and white students in the Oakland area
had been eliminated. This ambiguity is similar to the ones
referred to by our former editor. —

 *~ie Theparticular situation which the Dean of Students
 referring may have been justiﬁable. When the Univer-
guy had had a general file, of housing applications in the
P-Dakland area, doors were slammed in negroes’ faces. Since
this -had happened frequently, the University decided to
afveia separate ﬁle in order to eliminate this embarrassing
‘situation for the negro students. “

inent, the University was criticized for having a separate
file, the fact that they are using the “general file” again dges
-not seem to be the solution to this problem. Doors will just
slam again. ‘ ~

_ { ~ One cannot help but wonder why administrators take
‘5 housing offers from private homes, if they know the owners
will not accept negroes. Maybe this is the real solution, and
the only solution to eliminate discrimination. ._

’ The third article in thenewspapers last weekicontained
hmbiguious. statements concerning discrimination in organ-
izations which were not ‘directly under the University’s

ntrol. Thisindicated that administrators did not consider
this discrimination important enough to warrant careful in-
estigation. This investigation might have resulted in coin-

ciding statements for a change. i

, Both students and city newspaper editors have noticed
ﬁne vagueness in the attitudespof our administrators con-
éerning these problems. Possibly the embarrassment that
, we have all had to suffer because of these three issues, has
yﬁught all of us a le'sson—when there is something devious‘
about the actions. of students or administrators, itlshould be

By I-lorriof Welmer
The pressures of the ﬁnal weeks have put their

those loud tests. And the value
of these last efforts will be de- ‘
termined this Friday when ﬁnal
grades are turned into the Ofﬁce
of Student Records.

One solution used frequently
and successfully by students
lately to relieve the pressures of
ﬁnals has been the “G” grade.
This _incomplete grade permits
students to extend -a deadline

 

' for a course until the sixth week of the next term.

The $5 fee which must be paid for this grade is
rather inexpensive when one thinks of the divi-
dends. A mediocare term paper becomes and ex-
cellent one, a student inarticulate in a particular
language becomes adept, and the fog surrounding
Physics or Chemistry clears up for the science
“majors.

Unfortunately our grading system is based on‘

competition rather than a particular individual’s
progress. During the last three trimesters, students
have used the “G” grade as an escape from dead-
lines too often. Of the “G? grades issued to under-
graduate students, approximately 80 per cent of
them have not nTet the requirements that it stipu-
lates, according to the Office of Student. Records.
Circumstance Beyond Control '
This grade should be givenronly if extenuating
circumstances beyond the control of a student, such
as illness’ or a death in the family, prevents him
from completing the required work of the course.
 The student, who cajoles a “G” grade out of an
instructor, has violated our system of competition,

A Worthless Pursuit . . .

TeermllPaper Waste

By Jim Vaughan

Doing 3 term Paper is a pretty worthless pur-
suit. ‘In writing a term paper, the student learns
little information, wastes much time, and develops
anti-scholastic habits.

The student doesn’t "really acquire much worth-
while information by working on ‘
a special topi like “Williarn%;
James’ Symbolism,” “Tragedies
in the Devils,” and “Segregation;
and the Due Process Clause.” 1,
Besides, everyone quickly forgets 
any speciﬁc inforrnation once‘-
learned.

In doing a term paper. theg
student certainly doesn’t inte-‘
grate the material in his texts --
supposedly the main ‘reason for _

   
  

Such term paper subjects as those cited above
have so limited a scope, in relation to the rest of
the material covered in a course, that the student
cannot integrate the course material in his paper.‘
To do a good paper, on time," the student must
begin working early iii the term. '

This means that the student might find it a bit
difficult to integrate material yet to belearned.

Besides, if the student is going to integrate” the
material he covers in a course, he automatically
does so throughout the. term. A term paper does
not foster integration of material. It serves, in-
stead, as something which reﬂects whether ‘integra-
tion has or hasnot ocgurred during the course. .

’Not only is doing a termopaper unproductive;
it isia waste of time.

It’s unfortunate that the student has to waste
so much time searching through indexes and bibli-

fographies‘ for references. Worse yet, he has to _
—=spend untold hours skimming through worthless ,-
"material for a céuple of facts or cross-references.

he might have received if he» had _’met the same

Yet every story has two sides. Possibly one "of
the main reasons why instructors are so vulnerable
to the pleas of students for “G” grades is because
of their guilt feelings arising from a poor distribﬁ-~
tion of course work. Handling of courses in a hap-
hazard way is a well-trodden path of irist1'uct9rs
here at the University. _
Plight Created

Another reason, and possibly the only justifiable
one for the issuing of “G” grades, is the student’s
plight created by our “no ﬁnal week.” Because of
this situation, many instructors have sympathized

‘with the student and have issued “Cr” grades‘
i“ rather freely. ‘ ‘A ‘ ' o

The thrill of being academic pioneers‘ has dis-
appeared for students at the University, and only a
desire. for an organized systems of ﬁnals remains.
A period as traumatic as the last weeks of the term
needs organization to ease .the tension it creates.

Our present system permits instructors to con-
tinue with lecturqs until the last day of the term,
and many instructors.do this. Under these instruc-
tors, we are expected to be prepared for short:
quizzes and oral recitations. / ' ' '

tors do not try to eliminate the various problems
that currently exist here at the University,= then

typing the ﬁnal product. - ‘ ‘
It is ‘clear that in doing a term paper, ‘the’

student does learn one thing —- patience. That he

"learns anything else is debatable.

I‘ believe also that in doing a term’ paper ' a
studenvwastes valuable learning opportunities arid
represses real‘ scholarship.

Wrong Aﬂifudes

Consider a fairly bright student who is working
on a term paper. Finals are less than a month
away. And he has a second paper to write for
another class. He is reading a text written on his
subject, "Sixteenth Century Gargoyles.” While
searching for material to use in his paper, he does
not ask himself, “Is this really so” or “Why would
this be the case.” or even “Can this be the
reason why . . . ?” p .»

He asks himself, instead: “Can I use this“ fact":
“Should I footnote this idea”; and “Does this agree
with the information I already have.” -

This approach,'stimulated more by fear ‘than
genuine inter_e_st, is not, “I must learn this”, for it
is important,” but “I must copy this, for it is im-
portant.” What can be more insipid than parroting
information? ‘'2

More Profitable Hours
Of course a student learns something from —writ-
ing a term paper. But he can put to use, -much

more proﬁtably,» the twenty to ﬁfty hours he spends _

on his paper. ’ _ _
Term papers are a terrible burden on the*~'.stu-
dent. 'I’m sure that if there’s a Hell, .they’ll“_have
term papers down there. They are a waste of ‘time,
they foster anti-thoughtful approaches to learning,
and they fail pretty badly to instruct the student.
They are even more onerous to instructors; For
the instructor has not only to read a half a foot of
garbage in a short period~of time, but; he  to
grade pounds of scribbled ﬁnal .. exams 'at3 the

Hoopers Fail to
Show Offense
|n‘Sl'ee| Bowl

By TED COLTON
Sports Editor

 

 

Pitt’s failure to capture the Steel Bowl title Saturday night just

 about kills all hopes of the Panthers having any kind of success in
‘ basketball this year.

With such teams as Dartmouth, West Virginia, Temple, Villa-
nova and Fordham coming up, the Panthers will be lucky to win
ten games. In 1959 and ’60 the Cats had losing seasons, but at least
they ‘could look back to their Steel Bowl titles. And they did win
the one game that counted; they beat Duquesne. '

Now they have very little to look forward to and nothing to
look back on. '

‘Saturday night the Panthers showed two glaring weak-
nesses: a total disability to get that offensive rebound, and the
ever present condition of no offensive plays that enable the
Panther’s shooters to get a good jump shot somewhere near the
basket. ' ‘

t_‘ ‘

At the beginning of the season Coach Bobby Timmons cited the

' absence of a big man who could get the ball off the boards as the

Panthers big weakness. This had been quite evident in the first six
ball games. 1

John Fridleyi and Don Steinhart are big enough but they don’t
have the weight to get the position for the rebounds. The two foot-
ballers, Lou Slaby and John Maczuzak, are too far away from be-
coming good basketball players to be of much help to Timmons this
year. ‘

What would seem to be a bright spot in the Panther lineup
has not developed as such simply because the Panthers are not
showing the right kind of offense to utilize their strong points.
Dick Falenski, Ben Jinks, Bob. Sankey and Tom Maloney are good
backcourt men with deadly jump shots.

Jinks is uncanny with his jumper while Sankey, Maloney and
Falenski, when given a good shot, rarely miss. But in order for any
one of these players to get a good shot, he must work the ball
himself before the gets«loose._ ‘

Very seldom do the Panthers set up a screen, very seldom do
the Panthers work the ball into the keyhole for a jump shot, and very
seldom do the Panthers look like they have any offensive patterns
at all.

On defense they can hold their own.‘ Apparently Timmons has
picked up John Michelosen’s strategy of using defense to win ball
games. The Panthers hustle on defense and make the other teams
make mistakes, but this is not enough to win basketball games.

If Pitt is going to do any winning at all before the season is
over Coach Timmons will have to set up that good jump shot for
his backcourt men in order to have an offense that can score enough
points to make the defense effective.

Gymnasts Seek Winning Season

 

36 Freshmen 

  

Warren Neiger will learn quick—
ly if his Panther gymnastics team
will be able to achieve a winning
season without last year’s leading
scorers, Dave Hirst and Don Kes-
ner, when they inaugurate the
1961 season with Navy at the Field
House on Jan. 14. ~

“I haven’t heard any informa-
tion about Navy at the moment so
I do not know how to advise our
boys for the different events,” de-
clared Neiger who is in his ninth
year as head gym coach.

This is also the ninth season
that the Blue and Gold have
fielded a gymnastics team. Neiger
was the man selected by former
athletic director, Tom Hamilton, to
assemble the team and has been
quite successful. It also marks the
Jungle Cats’ eighth year in the
Eastern Intercollegiate Gymnas-
tics League.

Much of this scason’s success
‘will depend on four returning
lettermen including Earl Mc-
Connell, Joe Battaglia, Jack
Rainaldi and Ron Daugherty.
Newcomers to this year’s squad
who could add depth in certain

events are John Lehner, John
Patterson, Ray Lombardi, Bob
Pingatore and Ed Zamecnik.

A gymnastics meet consists of
six events, namely, tumbling, side
horse, high bar, rope climb, par-
allel bars and ﬂying rings. Team
points are awarded as follows:
ﬁrst place—-6 points, second——4,
third—3, fourth——-2, and ﬁfth——l.

Each team is allowed to enter
no more than three men in an
event, and one man can not com-
pete in more than three events.
There are three judges for each
event.

tle it out for the 191 pound berth;
the heavyweight division will be
either Bob Guzik or Gary Kalten—
bach.

Last “year the Panthers ended
up in second place in the Wilkes
tourney after dominating the
championship for the past three
years. This year Peery is con- .
ﬁdent‘ that the Blue and Gold
can recover their title.

“If we have all the boys there,
we will be in a good position to
win. The New York Athletic Club,
last year’s winner, will be the
team to beat. They have such
standouts as Doug Blubaugh and
Mel Turner, and Dave Auble may
be added to this year’s squad.

; DECK THE HALLS

The time has come to make out our Christmas shopping lists,

' for Christmas will be upon us quicker than you can say Jack
Robinson. (Have you ever wondered, incidentally, about the
origin of this interesting phrase “Quicker than you can say
Jack Robinson”? Well sir, the original phrase was French-
“Plus cite 9213 de dire Jacques Robe.spz'errc.” Jack Robinson is,
as everyone knows, an anglicization of Jacques Robespierre who
was, as everyone knows, the famous ﬁgure from the French
Revolution who, as everyone knows, got Inurclercd in his bath
by Danton, Murat, Caligula, and Aaron Burr.

(The reason people started saying “Quicker than you can say
Jacques Robespierre (or Jack Robinson as he is called in English-
spcaking countries)” is quite an interesting little story. It seems
that Robespierreﬁ wife, Georges Sand, got word of the plot to
murder her husband in his bath. All she had to do to save his
life was call his name and warn him. But, alas, quicker than
she could say Jacques Robespierre, she received a telegram from
her old friend Frederic Chopin who was down in Majorca setting
lyrics to his immortal “Warsaw Concerto.” Chopin said he
needed Georges Sand’s help desperately because he could not
ﬁnd a rhyme for “Wars:uv.” Naturally, Georges Sand could not
refuse such an urgent request.

(Well sir, Georges Sand went traipsing off to Majorca, but
before she left she told her little daughter Walter that some bad
men were coming to murder daddy in his bath, and she in-
structed Walter to shout Robespierre’s name when the bad men
arrived. But Walter, alas, had been sea-bathing that morning
on the Riviera, and she had come home loaded with sea shells
and salt water taffy, and when the bad men came to murder
Robespierre, Walter, alas, was chewing a big wad of salt water
taffy and could not get her mouth open in time to shout a
warning. Robespierrc, alas, was murdered quicker than you
could shout Jacques Robcspierre (or Jack Robinson as he is
called in tlfe English—speaking countries).

(There is, I am pleased to report, one small note of cheer in
this grisly tale. When. Georges Sand got to Majorca where
Chopin was setting lyrics to his immortal “Warsaw Concerto,"
she was happily able to help him ﬁnd a rhyme for “Warsaw,"!
as everyone knows who has heard those haunting lyrics:

In the fair town of Warsaw,

Which N apoleon’s horse saw,

,S£ngz'ng cocklcs and mussels, alive alive 0!)

But I digress.

We were speaking of Christmas gifts. What we all strive to do
at Christmas is, of course, to find‘ unusual, offbeat, different
gifts for our friends. May I suggest then a carton of Marlboro
Cigarettes? _

What? You are astonished? You had not thought of Marlboros
as unusual, offbeat, different? You had regarded them as familiar,
reliable smokes whose excellence varied not one jot or tittle
from year to year?

True. All true. But at the same time, Marlboros are unusual,
offbeat, different, because every time you try one, it’s like the
first time. The ﬂavor never palls, never gets hackneyed. Each
Marlboro is a fresh delight, a pristine pleasure, and if you want
all your friends to clap their hands and exclaim, “Yes,'Virginia,
there is a. Santa Claus 1” you will put them at the very top of

your Christmas list. 9 mo M,,,, sham.

And for further Yuletide joy, give Marlboro’a nonfiltered
companion cigarette, mild, ﬂavorful Philip Morris——in regu-
lar size or the sensational new king-size Commander. You’ll
be welcome aboard!

Student teachershave been in-
cluded in the plan because as Miss
Savina S. Skewis, director of
women’s student affairs said, “The
University does not feel that those
women students assigned to off-
campus schools should be com-_
pelled to pay the additional $.50
for a meal they never eat."

Dear Dr. Frood: Don't you agree that every college
man has the right, in fact, the duty, to stand up and
speak out for the things he believes in? Tomorrow
I am going straight to the college president and
tell him, politely but firmly, what is wrong here-
the inferior teaching, the second-rate accommoda-
tions, the bad food. My friends think I am wrong to
do this. What do you think?

Dear Dr. Frood: Our son has been in college three

Not even a post card. I don't want him to think I am

too demanding or overprotective, but frankly I am ‘

worried. What should I do?

DEAR WORRIED: Why worry after only three months
in college? He's still learning how to write.
