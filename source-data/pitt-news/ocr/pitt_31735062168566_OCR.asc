Editor, Pitt News:

I am a Pitt student and the
proud owner of a bright, shiny,
new all purpose ID card. This
past Saturday, I left my home
bright and early, drove the ten’
miles to Oakland, parked a mile
from Pitt Stadium, walked to the
student entrance, pulled out by
bright, shiny, new all purpose ID
card, showed it to the gate atten-
dant, and was immediately ac-
cused of trying to get in on some-
one elses card. The card was
taken from me and I was told
to leave.

Well, .knowing that the card I

was paid for by, the activities
fund and I had contributed $5 to
that fund, I kindly asked the
gate attendant to give me my
card back and let me in. He re-
sponded by calling a policeman
who immediately removed me
from the stadium.

The policeman left me with a
Pitt student who asked me for
my identiﬁcations. When I left
my car, I had assumed that ID
was an abreviation for identiﬁca-
tion, so I left my wallet in my
glove compartment. To make a
long story short, the only way
that I could watch Pitt play that
Saturday was to walk the two
miles round trip to my car and
produce some sort of identiﬁca-
tion. I used last years ID card.

I am writing this letter for two

reasons. Being a full-time Stu.
dent at Pitt, I feel that I an; en.

one had the courtesy to offer me
an apology for accusing me false-
ly and making me walk to my

. car and back.‘ Secondly, the pic-

ture on my ID card is not a true
likeness of me. I have looked at
many other students ID cards
and have come to the conclusion
that the pictures are not true
likeness of them. It seems to me
that the photographic equipment
used to make the pictures was
defective and steps should be
taken to produce new ID cards
for students such as myself who

need them.

  Board

Appointed

In the future when a woman
dorm resident has to “go to
court,” it may be the one located
in’ the staff room of Bracken-
ridge Hall. Each Wednesday eve-
ning this year, the new 1966-67_
Associated Women Students Ju-
dicial Court (AWSJC) Will be
available for sessions.

The court, composed of ﬁve
senior women chosen by the Ex-
ecutive Committee of AWS,was
created to replace the penalty
boards formerly operating with-
in each dormitory. Unlike the old
“’boards,” AWSJC will not in-
clude any head resident at the
meetings, leaving only students
in charge.

Two functions of the Judicial
Court will be giving penalties to
residents who have broken dor-
mitory regulations and serving as‘
a court of appeals.

The ﬁve “jurors” on AWSJC in-
clude: Helen Brisee, Trish Cloyd,
Peggy Llewelyn, “Sage” Nowlin,
and Marcia Halleck, chairman.

Speaks Here to Students

(Continued from Page 1)

was opened to questions from the
student audience as had been
done by Democratic gubernatoral
candidate Milton Shapp last week.
The question of discrepency be-
tween in-state and out-of-state
tuition rates was again brought
up in regard to Shapp’s “pro-
posed free higher education for
Pennsylvania.” Staisey could only
reiterate the point that “we must
wory about Pennsylvania resi-
dents before out-of-staiters.”
He argued, “How can you ex-
pect us to lower tuition rates for
out-of-staters with Pennsylvania
tax dollars?” When quesioned
further on the fact that other
large state schools do not have
such a wide difference in tuition,
he replied, “I’m sure that at ﬁrst
they too worried mainly about
their own state students, and tui-

tion rates- were much higher for .

out-of-staters. Perhaps after a
while some adjustment may be
made here.” .
Another signiﬁcant issue was
raised when a student asked,

“What do you porpo-se to do with .

the outmoded state constitution

Uniersity Students
Run Cycle Raceway

A group of enterprising Univer-I
sity students have undertaken;
the management of Murraysville
Raceway, and are currently con-
ducting their ﬁrst season of
American Motorcycle Association-
sanctioned racing.

The raceway is located in an
old strip mine and is owned by
Civic Center Sports. Its three
tracks include: a three mile mo-
torcycle cross course; an unhill
drag course; and a four-tenth of
a mile scramble course.

‘ Frank Gambol, a junior in met-
allurgical engineering, ‘became
track manager last September
when he heard that Civic Center
Sports was trying to ﬁll that posi-
tion. Richard Warren, senior in
electrical engineering, serves as
track publicity director, and Paul
Gerrie,Ajunior in petroleum engi-

neering, acts as starter for -the
events. I _ ~
Some ‘of the track’s top riders
include University students: Rip
Martin, Ivan Gold, Chris MacIn-
tosh, Mike Greenberg and Dan
Droney. '

Competitive events are held
every Sunday, and admission is
one dollar. A These events are
based on strict amateur competi-
tion with trophies, but no cash
awards, going to the winners. Al-
though the track has a maximum
seating capacity of 1,000 persons,
01113’ 3004 people have ever been
present for one day’s series of
events. Next season, starting in
April, Murraysville Raceway will
try to have a full schedule of

competition in conjunction with, A

other local tracks
nights and Sundays.

and the section which says a
governor cannot succeed him-
self?” Staisey answered, “Of
course, we would like to change
this, and I think this will be
raised in an upcoming meeting
of the legislature.”

  
   

crnor candidate Leonard Staisey

being interviewed before speak-

ing to Young Democratic gather-

ing Wednesday in SU Lower
Lounge.

A rather sensitive, but impor-
tant point was raised by the next
to last question which was “what
problems will arise if Republican-
eandidate Raymond P. Shafer is
elected Governor and you be-
come Lieutenant Governor?” The
reality of this possibility became
quite apparent only a few hours
before the discussion when the
early issues of the Pittsburgh
Press supported Staisey over
Shafer’s running mate, Raymond
J. Broderick. Earlier the}. Press
had supported Shafer over Shapp.

Staisey commented,‘ “I think
such a situation is very doubtful
unless the election is extremely
close. Only once before did the
voters elect 2:. Governor and
Lieutenant Governor from diﬂer-
ent parties. I believe this hap-
pened. in 1891 when we had a
Democratic Governor and Repub-
lican Lieutenant Governor-

In an earlier interview with a
television station Staisey had
added that if such a situation
would occur he would see no
difficulties in such an arrange-
ment. He *add'ed,‘however, that
he felt the voters would vote
along party lines even though he
admitted “the party platforms
.are somewhat similar since the
Republicans adopted most o-f our
stands this time.”

The ﬁnal question was “Would
‘you make a statement on foreign
Dolicy?” and Staisey:-succinctly
replied, “No.” With this issue -the
discusion ended and so did the
University visits of the Demo-
cratic canidates.

tion becomes widespread Morse
beleives that it can lead to world
chaos.

The only solution that Morse
sees is -for the developed coun-
tries of the world to open their

_markets to underdeveloped coun-

tries. When the products of the
smaller nations gain a larger
share of the world market, they
can begin a program of national
industrialization. Mr. Morse be-
lieves that this type of “new in-
ternational division of labor" will
result in the more efficient use
of the world’s resources.

One drawback to this scheme
is that it will cause grave dis-
turbances in ‘the economic and
social organizations of both weal-
thy and underdeveloped coun-
tries. In the smaller nations there
are formidable obstacles to such
an economic reorganization. Such

Steel Bowl Underway

But Big Names Aren’t

By Tom Sacks
Sports Editor

It doesn’t seem quite right to be talking about basket-
ball in the middle of the football season. Therefore, maybe
it would be more appropriate to talk about charity. For
charity_ is never out of season.

No, not charity towards the Panthers, but the .more
monetary kind which is soon to be derived from basketball.

Last Wednesday night the Steel Bowl Basketball Tour-
nament held its kickoff dinner for this yeai"s December
9-10 tourney. The four teams in the event are the two con-
stants, Pitt and Duquesne, plus Columbia and Indiana State
of Terra Hautel

The tournament is sponsored by Nobles.
and Knights Charities, which is a combina-

Columbus.

Among the beneficiaries of the Steel
Bowl are the Allegheny School for Excep-
tional Children, St. Anthony’s School for
Exceptional Children, McGuire Memorial
Hospital for Exceptional Children, and the
Western Pennsylvania School for the Blind.

With such a noble purpose, it is unfortunate, but true,
that the tournament has been a failure in its past two years.
And from the looks of things, it is headed in the same direc-
tion this year. ‘

Over the past two years. the two night affairs has only
managed to fill roughly half of the Civic Arena. The amount
donated to the above named organizations for the. unfor-
tunate child during the same
period has been $10,000. It
should have been more and
the major reason it hasn’t is
due to the lack of appeal of
the visiting teams.

But the simple solution of
inviting top name teams isn’t
as simple as it might appear.
For it is money which draws
the top names and not char-
ity or worthy causes. '

The way the tournament
is presently set up, 50 per-

"cent of the gate is taken by
the Nobles and Knights. The
other half of the profits is
split by the competing teams.
Visiting teams also receive
expenses.

Athletic Director Frank Carver and Doc Skinner, Du;
ques.ne’s Ab, are responsible for arranging the visiting
teams. As Carver explains it, the reasons for Indiana State
a.nd Columbia are cold and hard—money.

‘_‘We run into.a lot of difficulties. The money is just
not right for the‘ big names. It’s also a bad time of the year
for a tournament.” .

The maximum that a competing team can expect from
the Steel Bowl is $2,500. Compare this figure with the
$12,000 received by each team in the Kentucky Invitational.
Even the Raleigh Christmas Classic, in which Pitt is en.-
tered, is twice as profitable. Carver expects roughly $6,000
for the two nights.

This is more money than was made during all of Pitt’s
‘home basketball games last year.

Panthers Poised For Upset
Of Black Knights f Hudson

“THE HUDSON River is over that way.” If the
Panthers don’t make a better showing against Army

Like the cat backed against the wall,
the Panthers arein a position to pounce

upon Army tomorrow at Michie Stadium.
That is if they don’t fall behind early in the game.

In four of five games, the Panthers were losing
from the early moments of each game. “We have
been forced with the exception of one game (Duke)
to play catch-up,” coach Dave Hart said. “When this
happens, everything is in the opponents favor.”

In those five games, the Panthers did not have
good field position to score. And it is the punting
game thatihas proved costly as a result. Aldo Zor-
tea has kicked 30 times this season. He averages
34.7 yards while the opponents average 39.3 yards.

Opponents have scored 76 points (of 139) from
the 50-yard line or closer. “We have not had people
backed-up enough,” Hart said. “Opponents’ offensive
teams are at midfield, the free winning zone, be-
cause of our poor punting. Once they’re within the
40-yard line, then they have four downs to make
the sticks and this poor field position hurts us.”

In the West Virginia victory, the Panthers were
behind their 30 only three times. In games the Pan-
thers could have won, Hart feels his team was
backed-up far too many times.

“Against Navy, it was 12 times, Duke, 11 times,
and Cal, 12 times,” said Hart, “and when you’re
backed-up, the offense must go. 70 yards to score.
Heck, they’ll always look bad then.”

“The punting game is also poor when you’re
backed-up," Hart said.

“At Army, 1 expect a good effort,” continued
Hart. “And I can’t remember when I have had two
bad games in a row.” .

Backed against the wall, himself, Hart said last
week’s game was, “the worst including UCLA.”
Against Army; he said he would try to run the ball
despite defense being the name of the game at
West Point.

tomorrowthan they did against Navy last week, this
might be what coach Hart will be tempted to say.

“Assignment-wise, we are going to have prob-
lems blocking Army,” said scouting coach Frank
Cignetti. “Defensively, they play a wide tackle-six,
a stunting team, and they seldom give the same
look.’’ C

And like Navy, but unlike the Panthers, Army
has a “real fine punter in Ron Wasilewki who can
keep you in the hole,” continued Cignetti.

If the Panthers Cat is to “jump tomorrow, it
could be through the air. “Army’s pass defense is
the one weakness which stood out,” said Cignetti.
“And Notre Dame exploited this (35-0), as did
Penn State.”

Quarterback Ed James, the main artery of the’
Panther offense, has averaged 12 completions out
of 26 passes per game. In five games, he has
totaled 737 yards and three touchdowns.

Receivers “Bob 'Longo and Mickey Rosborough,
average six and three catches per game respective-
ly. Longo has scored three touchdowns.

“Offensively, Army is not real impressive be-
cause they haven’t been able to move the ball,”
said Cignetti. “The potential is there, however, in
two good runners and alternating sophomore quar-
terbacks.”

Mark Hamilton, an explosive type of halfback,
and John Peduto, Virginia’s 100-yard dash cham-
pion in high school, are the runners.

The two soph quarterbacks are Jim O‘Toole
and Steve Lindell. “Lindell basically is a sprint-out
runner while O’Toole is a drop back type passer,”
Cignetti said.

As in four of the five games played, the Pan-
thers are underdogs by eight points. But in 12
games against Army, the Panthers show eight wins,
two losses, and two ties. Both losses came at West
Point. 

“If our all people are back physically,” said
Cignetti, “we are on a par with them and have a
good chance of beating Army.”

Grove City Hosts Booters’
  Funeral; Kent to Try Burial

by MIKE BROURMAN

Slippery Rock built the
coffin, and Grove City nailed
it up tight. When the boot-
ers lost their second straight
game to a small college op-
ponent on Wednesday, it

The booters aren’t mudders.
Grove City proved that, as they
won easily in the rain and mud,
4-1. But, the conditions can’t be
blamed for this latest defeat
Grove City had to play on the
same ﬁeld. It was a couple of
fatal defensive mistakes that
sunk the soccer team.

Grove City’s scouting reports

were ﬁlled with glowing com-
ments about the booters. All it
took, however, was one mistake
for them to forget about how
good the soccer team was sup-
posed to be.

That mistake occured when
goalie Len Harmon misjudged a
ball, came out of the net to get
it, and had a Grove City forward
beat him to it. He, passed it to
Scott Gay who put it into the va-
cant net.

This go-al ﬁred up the Grovers,
and before long they got ano-ther
one. Again it was an error which
proved costly, when one of the
booters forgot to cover his man
on a corner kick. The neglected
player, wing Hank Bossers beat

Tied Second Straight Time

Frosh Bootersy Meet Kent;
Frustrated by Slippery Rock

The freshman booters were frustrated for the second

time last Wednesday by Slippery Rock‘ State. The frosh
were held to an overtime 1-1 tie at home, bringing their

record to 1-0-2. Their other tie
was also against Slippery Rock.

The frosh scored their only
goal in the second quarter on a
kick from the left side by for-
ward Bob Trexler in the second
quarter. Slippery Rock tied the
game in the third quarter on a
penalty kick, ending the scoring.

The freshman team has shown’
good defense this season but has
been hampered by poor ball con-
trol, which coach George Som-
mer believes is their major weak-
ness. Although the frosh pass
well as a team, their shooting
has been poor. They had 15 goal
shots against Slippery Rock last
Wednesday and converted only
one, but they held Slippery Rock
to only three shots at their goal.

The team’s defensive strength
is due to Sommer’s three half-
back, three fullback system. The
center halfback serves as a rover

- in the set-up, guarding his own

men while covering any holes in
the defense. The defensive cen-
ter‘ halck is: co-captain Ron Mie-
lecki.

The team’s strongest point on
offense is center forward Bob
Quinlan, also a co-captain, who
serves as rover behind the left
and right wingbacks. .

Sommer had few comments 0

haslthe Pitt frosh slated to play
at Kent State next Saturday, Oct.

Virginia at home on Oct. 29, and

Akron the toughest opponent, be-
cause some Akron freshmen also
play on the varsity team.

to stop the shot.

Grove City scored again before
the half, and this time no booter
was at fault. With the referee
screened from the action, a Grov-
er, again Scott Gay, knocked the
ball down with his hand, and
then blasted it into the net, an
it was 3-0 at the half. .

Cubs Seek Second Win
In ‘Game of the Week’

by ROY JACOBS
Tomorrow’s ‘_‘Game of the Week” will be played at South
Bend, Indiana, matching Notre Dame and the University of
Pittsburgh. The -only things missing will be ABC’s color

cameras and Ara Parseghian.'Ac-
tually, it’s only a matchup of the
Irish freshmen and the Cubs,
but judging by the pre-game
buildup it ought to be of national
interest." \

This is the ﬁrst time Notre
Dame has ﬁelded a freshman

came out ﬁred up. After less
than two minutes of play, Bob
Racunas scored. But it was short
lived at best. Two minutes later
Bossers capitalized on "another
booter mistake and scored his
secon-d goal. This was the ﬁnal
nail in the coffin. The soccer
team quit applying the pressure,
andthe game ended with Grove
City ﬁghting for another goal.

Tomorrow the booters travel
to Kent State. On their earlier
trips, they had something to look
forward to—the NCAA bid that
they all expected. Now there is
nothing, except pride.

This was supposed to be a
great team. So far, except for
scattered incidents, they have not
shown it. “On paper,” said cap-
tain Art Richardson, “we were
really good. But We must have
something - missing, because we
don’t show it. We want to score,
but we just can’t do it.”

Maybe now, with the pressure
off, the booters can prove they
can win.

unit in actual competition, and the
.Irish are going to great lengths
to make sure they win. Their
scouting system brought back in-
formation about the Cubs’ of-
fensive and defensive systems
against which the Irish drilled
last Friday and Saturday.
“Our scout said they practice
alone,” said coach Steve Pvetro,
_ “and the freshmen just don’t get
near the varsity.” This in itself
is a complete turn-about from
Notre Dame’s original freshman
football policy.

“I just hope our boys are pre-
pared well enough,” said Petro.
“It’s going to be a tough game.”

It’s going to be a really tough
game if the Cubs can’t improve
their ground attack over their
last game against West Virginia
when they managed only 23
yards.

“We just didn’t block,” ana-
lyzed Petro. -“What yardage we
gained was on individual efforts.”
He also indicated that Denny

Allocations

(Continued from Page 1)
must decide whether the money
will be allocated at all. Cabin
noted that he planned to defend
the same stand he had assumed
previously.

Other organizations whose re-
quests were returned to the com-
mittee were the Hill Education
Project, the Owl, Students for
Peace, and the SUB. Additional
funds given these organizations
would come from the $11,000 dif-
ference between funds available
and funds allocated. A $6,000 al-
location for Winter Weekend will
also have to be taken out of this
difference, according to lRalph'
Manning, president of SG.

The list of approved allocations
include: Alpha Epsilon Delta, $0;
Alpha Phi-_.Omega, $290; Ameri-
can Pharmaceutical Association,

ator, a national student mag-

azine.

“American colleges and univer-
sities claim concern with the per-
sonality development of their stu-
dents. They seem better at en-
couraging ﬁersonal destruction,”
comments Moderator editor Phil-
ip Werdell.

“When we started examining
research on student suicide‘ we
did not want to believe what we
read. During the summer we un-
dertook an extensive survey of
every type of college. All our
studies conﬁrmed existing ﬁnd-
ings.”

“First, suicide is at least the
second greatest cause of death
‘among students. (On some cam-
puses, it is close to the ﬁrst.)
Second, the suicide rate on cam-
pus is probably higher than for
Americans in general.”

The higher student suicide rate

"could be due to the more accur-

ate records kept in colleges, but
Mr. Werdell claims that Modera-
tor’s suicide projections are con-
servative. “Our projections were
taken only from recorded threats,
attempts and acts of suicide. Of-
ten deaths by suicide are not re-
corded—or recorded" ‘accidental’
deaths—because of social and re-
ligious pressure or because of in-
complete information. Moreover,
we found that college adminis-
trators and campus mental health
professionals whom we had con-
tacted had very incomplete ﬁg-
ures.”

Figures on suicide are more
shocking than instructive. “The
real problems are an outmoded
system of higher education and
generally inadequate campus
mental health services,” con-
cludes the Moderator article.

“At Present, the college teach-
es the function of symbolism in
Campus while- students are dig-
ging the real ~message—to be or
not to be. Awareness is trigger-
ed, and the student arrives at a

crucial juncture in life. The col-

lege responds with subject .mat-
ter rather than subjects that mat-
tcr,” says Mr. Werdell. “The re-
sult is severe alienation and

stress-—not the productive stress
that a. writer or businessman ex-

periences in creative moments

but destructive stress of scholas-

tic categories arbitarily deﬁned

and decisions remotely made.”
In 1963, a national survey in-

dicated that only 76 colleges and “A

universities offered student coun-

seling by a professional psycholo— j

gist or psychiatrist, and that at‘
large schools where these services
were most likely to be available
the percentage of students served
tended to drop. The Moderatgr
study also found that since their
campus mental health facilities
have not signiﬁcantly improved,

“A few more campuses have add-, -I .

ed mental health clinics and a
few of the existing clinics have

been slightly expanded, but the

existing student mental health

services are simply inadequate}? E 0 "

The ways in which colleges
can help distressed students are
amazingly sirnple,‘claims Mr. Wer-
dell. “One answer is to give stu-
dents more opportunity to form-
alize their own education. Stu-
dents are uniquely honest regard-
ing the relevance of the educa-
tion they are presented. The col.-
lege at the same time must hire

 more mental health professions, 0'

The ﬁrst gives students the “op-

portunity to discover; the second ‘ ‘

gives the student the opportunity

‘to fail. Both are necessary. Com-

bined they would cost no more
than an annual subscription to

Playboy for each student Amer-

ica obviously has the money. Col-
leges can no longer put oﬁ their
responsibilities.

The national efforts singled out-
for praise ‘in the article were.
those of the National Institute of
Mental Health (NIMH) « and the
United States National Student
Association (USNSA). The NIIVH-I
has begun to face the problems of
suicide head on by creating a
National‘ Institute for Suicide Pre-_
vention. The NSA is ‘launching

a series of campus self-study pro-'“ '

grams to more precisely deﬁne

the problems of student -stress , i

and» try to discover solutions ap-
plicable on these individual cam-_
puses. -

 Motivation

Recruits

Operation Motivation is now
recruiting new members who are
willing to help tutor children in
the Hill District, says Catherine
Briscoe, a YWCA staff member
at the University.

The project is designed to help
children who need tutoring in
certain subjects or who could be
just a friend. Many of the chil-
dren ‘come from extremely poor
homes, where parents work most
of the time and rarely see them,
much‘ less have time to give
them any cultrural stimulus.

Miss Briscoe reminds that a
great deal of time is not in-
volved, but only an hour a Week.

. It is a challenge to students and

a job 'that needs to be done.
Right now the number involved

‘ is very small and many more

volunteers are needed
project is to succeed.

Sororities Compete At

Sigma Chi Derby Day

Sigma Chi Fraternity will
hold its ﬁrst annual Derby
Day next Saturday, accord-
ing to Ed Reger and Bruce
Anderson, co-chairmen for
the event. Derby Day is a
national Sigma Chi tradition,

criginating at the UCLA chap-

ter in the early thirties.

Derby Day will consist of the
various sororities competing
against each other in such activ-
ities as three-legged races and
other athletic events to be judged
by members of the faculty. Each
sorority participating will be
coached by a brother of Sigma
Chi.

There will also be a “dress the
coach” contest, in which each
sorority will try to “outdress”
each other’s coaches.

In all, there will be ten events,
and a sterling silver Champagne
Bucket from Tiffany's of New
York will be awarded the soror-
ity that accumulates the most
points. Other trophies will be
presented for the various rim-
ners-up.

The evening's activities will be
highlighted by the Derby Ball, at
which the Derby Darling will be
chosen. Each competing sorority
will nominate a potential Derby
Darling and the decision will be
made by the following panel of
judges: ‘
