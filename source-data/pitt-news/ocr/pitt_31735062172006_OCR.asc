The LRWI_)_._(3 story

by MARLENE ZNOY

(Editor's note: In her conclud-
ing article on the University's
Learning Research and Develop-
ment Center, Pitt News reporter
Marlene Znoy examines some of
the Center's classroom methods
employed at Frick School).

Across the street from the
University Book Center. a unique
experience in learning is going
on for approximately 450 students
of the Frick Elementary School.
Grades pre-school through two
operate under the auspices of the
Learning Research and Devel-

opment Center (LRDC) of the
University.
The LRDC program began

five years ago and moves up one

grade level per year. It is the
result of research carried on by
the Center in the areas of in-
structional design and attempts
to channel the learning process
into the schools curriculum.

The School initially featured
an Individually Prescribed In-
struction Project (IPI), which is
an instructional program de-

veloped by the Center and based
on structured sequenced lessons
which a child works on at his
own pace. This, however, prov-
ed to be unsatisfactory for stu-
dents from economically depriv-
ed backgrounds since it assum-
ed that the children had the
prerequisite abilities to begin
the program.

As a result. the Center devel-
oped the Primary Education Pro-
ject (PEP) which was first in-
corporated into Frick School
where 80 per cent of the students
are black. many of whom are
residents of the Hill District.

Backward Analysis

PEP bases its instruction on
more manipulative. gamelike
activities in order to develop
necessary skills in the children.
After mastery of PEP instruc-
tions. students move on into the
IPI program.

The PEP program in the var-
ious subjects involves a back-
ward analysis. For instance. what

.must a child already know in or-

der to be able to learn to count

*'Thel?

to‘100‘.’ Obviously. he must know

how to count to 90; to do that he
must be able to count to 80. and

eral hundred objectives in each
unit. Upon entering the school,
students are given preliminary
placement tests ‘in which their
pre-school abilities and apti-
tudes are tested. Through the re-
sults of this testing, a child is
given a “prescription” for study.
He may be able to skip the first
few units and begin at the fourth.

The child then is given a
"ticket" with his prescription on
it for example. Math. Unit 4,
which he matches up with a
box containing his instructional
materials. The box may contain
blocks. chips. numerals or some

other manipulative item which he ~

matches up or counts our de-

After the child completes his
prescription. he takes a diag-
nostic test to determine whether
or not he has mastered the ob-
jective. I

by being given the opportunity

In Women’s Work Conference

Equal Employ Sought

by LORETTA HORRELL

A one-day conference here
Tuesday explored the possibility
for full employment for women
and attracted academicians and
industrialists from universities

and corporations across the nation.

The conference, called “Wom-
en: Action not Reaction”, was
designed in the belief that the
individuals attending were ac-
tively confronting the problem of
implementing an action program
for the full employment of wom-
en.

Dr. Dennis P. Slevin, Assis-
Business at
Pitt, described the purposes of
the conference as three-fold.
“The purposes are to bridge the
communication gap, to provide
specific examples of working ac-
tion programs and to provide
a general framework.“ stated
Slevin.

Slevin outlined four types of
firms where females may be un-
deremployed.

“First, there is the recession-
ary firm whose major problem is
inflation,” remarked Slevin. “The
second firm, low female employ-
ment, has a -problem with re-
cruitment. The third, high fe-
male employment with low fe-
male management, has a problem
with placement and education,
and the final firm, academic in-
stitutions, has a problem analyz-
ing personnel data properly.”

However, Slevin. optimistic for
the future. offered promising
predictions. “The government
will become more aggressive in
enforcing the Civil Rights Act.
There will be an attitudinal
change on the part of society. and
the speed of response by organ-
izations will be rapid when

considering minority groups,"
Slevin projected.

An Action ‘Checklist. prepared
by Slevin, was distributed to the
participants. The Checklist in-
cluded a format for implement-
ing an action program. for the
employment of women.

A government official, Ms.
Mary Hilton, Deputy Director,
Women’s Bureau, Department of
Labor, reviewed pertinent laws
and recent court cases relating
to the employment of women.

A research psychologist, Dr.
Virginia Ellen Schein, Manger
of Personnel Research, Life Of-
fice Management Association,
reported on industrial research
concerning sexual and manager-
ial stereotypes that she is con-
ducting.

Other speakers included Dr.
Barbara W. Newell, Special As-
sistant to the President at the
University of Michigan and

Ms. Wilma Scott Heide. a mem-

ber of the Pennsylvania Human
Relations Commission and chair-
woman of the National Organiza-
tion for Women (NOW). New-
ell labeled the conference a
"first stage" in the development
of equal employment opportun-
ities for women.

Participants included repre-
sentatives from Chrysler. Con-
tinental Can, Gulf Oil, Dow

Chemical, Bell Telephone, AT&T.
Eastman Kodak, Kopper’s, and
Westinghouse.

The conference was sponsored
by the University Graduate
School of Business.

The University has broadened its policy on acceptance of
college entrance examination tests and now will permit a student
applying for undergraduate study to submit scores from the Am-
erican College Testing (ACT) program.

Previously, Pitt had restricted prospective students to taking
the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) of the College Entrance Ex-

amination Board (CEEB ).

“We are changing our requirements so that students who
only had taken the ACT will not be forced to spend additional
money and time in taking the SAT plus Achievement tests,” said,
Kenneth Wenger, dean of admissions and student aid.

Under the new program. a student may now elect to take
the ACT test and no other. However should a student choose to
take the SAT. he also must take the required Achievement Tests
of the CEEB. In the School of Engineering, this would mean the
student must take the achievement test in English composition.
math level 1 or 2 and the chemistry or physics test.

For the School of Nursing, the Achievement tests required ‘

would be English composition and math 1 or 2. In the College of
Arts & Sciences, the Achievement test would be English composi-
tion and two other tests of the students choice.

I The new policy will be effective for students applying for

1972 classes.

Complacency Charged,-

by SUE HOENSTINE

After an 11-year stint with the
University. Saga Food Service
has been replaced.

John Vrana, director of Hous-
ing, reported that the name of
the new food service will be
made public after the contract
is completed next week. It is
rumored, however, that Saga’s
replacement will be Szabo Food
Service of Lyons, Illinois.

Vranar Saga out. news photo.

Presently the new food serv-
ice is negotiating a takeover of
responsibilities with the Univer-
sity and Saga.

Vrana said that the new opera-
tors plan to “make improvements
in services for nonboarding stu-
dents.“ Expanding services in
vending areas, the Tuck Shop,
and the Hunt room are specific
concerns of the new firm he said.

Saga was informed of the
switch last Thursday. “Many of

Saga feel that they have become

complacent and have had serious .

problems in management turn-
over, communication between

the local management team and“

regional managers, in responding
to student and staff suggestions,
and in providing a quality food
service,” Vrana stated.

The Housing director also re-
ported that “the transfer of re-
sponsibilities is proceeding in a
spirit of good faith and cooper-
ation."

The new food service was un-
animously recommended by the
14 member-Food Service Com-
mittee May 19. ‘

The Committee began its in-
vestigation of 16 food firms, one
of which was Saga, the first week
of March. The eight students and
six administrators on the Food
Service Committee were divided
into two subcommittees and
worked independently of each
other.

One subcommittee, chaired
by Don Hughes, Associate Dir-~
ector of Housing,
compared contract proposals of
the 16 firms in question. Will
Miller, Assistant Director of
Housing, headed the second sub-
committee which visited about 20
colleges and contacted two

schools served by each food ser- 

vice under consideration. Both
subcommittees chose the food

service that is now negotiating , 

with Pitt, and Saga ranked third
with both.
Vrana said that "students pro-

vided the major input. for the de-
cision and should be given a

maximum amount of credit‘ for 

their work. “

The youngest son of a large
family isymore likely to become
an "alcoholic than his brothers
and sisters, according to Doc-
, tor Herbert Barry III, a profes-
 ,so'r_ of pharmacology at Pitt.

  Barry based his conclusions on
a study performed by him and
his? colleagues. Doctor Howard
T. Blane, associate professor of
special education at Pitt, and
Barry's father, Doctor Herbert
Barry, Jr., a member of the psy-
chiatry department at Massa-

which encourages interaction
among them.

in determining whether or not
the other children take to drink:
"First children, middle children.

‘ and girls are all found to run the

same chance of alcoholism."

Barry feels that "the last male
child is the only vulnerable po-
sition in the family.“ noting that
"girls who are the youngest child
aren't affected."

However. family size. Barry

‘said. can make a difference. The

Harry study showed that the
larger the size of the family. the
more likely is the youngest son
to become an alcoholic. With a
family of 10 children, the young-
est son is five times as likely to
turn to alcoholism as the oldest.
In a family of vive children.

he is only twice as likely. When
there are only two children. the
risks run by the younger son
are ‘only slightly greater than
those of the older.

Barry said that these condi-

/tions can be attributed to- the tra-

ditional’ male and female roles
assigned in Western society.

Everyone has needs of both
dependence and independence.
Although society requires self-

reliance at times. in times of
stress people need someone to
turn to. Parents and friends can
normally satisfy these needs.

However. Barry believes that
"Western society has given wo-
men freedom toexpress emotion-
al dependence. but has tried to

new ideas to Frick, such as some
open classroom concepts.

Frick is academically super-
ior when compared to many oth-
er pre-school programs. Chil-
dren at the kindergarten level
are reading and working on ad-
dition and subtraction.

"When I taught at another
kindergarten." said one'_teacher.
"I felt pleased when the chil-
dren could count up to 10.
Many other kindergartens are
much more socially oriented.
We combine the social and the

‘ academic."

Teachers in the program at-
tend three-week summer work-
shops and engage in ongoing
training. They help in design-
ing some of the curriculum us-
ed at the school and have [trav-
elled to different school dis-
tricts to observe and bring back

Parents of the students see
what their children are doing by
preparing the materials that go
into the boxes for classroom use,
thus making the program a com-
munity effort.

It is in the classrooms at Frick
that the learning concepts and
programs developed and research-
ed by hundreds of staff members
of the LRDC merge with the
time and patience of co-ordin-
ators, teachers and parents to
produce a sound. professional
educational environment for the
children.

Still. the most beautiful part
of the whole system is that the
kids make it work.

ence. strength. and generally be-
ing able to cope."

"Men aren‘t supposed to cry.
or even ask for~help." he said."
The result is that they repress
and deny‘ their natural human
need for emotional expression
ofdependencef‘

The youngest child is more
likely to turn to drink. Barry
said since these two forces clash
more severely within him than
within his brothers and sisters.

Barry said that the youngest
child is “babied" more than the
others. constantly finding him-
self in a dependent position

throughout childhood.

He pointed out that “If the
youngest is a girl. this treat-
ment is consistent with the role
society has traditionally assign-
ed her. but if the youngest is a
boy the conflict between depen-
dence and independence is shar-
pened. sometimes unbearably."

As a result. said Barry, such
men search for a socially-approv-
ed outlet for their tensions. and
find a readily accessible one in
alcohol.

In addition. alcohol gives men
"the illusion of being strong
and capable." providing both an
illusory independence and a
realdependence.

Treatment Urged
To Curb VD Spread

Dr. Joseph‘ Hinchcliffe. Me-
dical Director of the Student
Health Center. said recently that
"gonorrhea has become a nation-
al epidemic. outranking flu.
measles. chicken pox. and other
bacterial infections."

Hinchclifle said that this
most common of venereal di-
seases has an incubation period
of three days to two weeks after

contact. He said that blatant
symptoms do not occur as rea-
dily in the female as in the
male.

"The disease is more insidious
in a female." helsaid, “because
it is silent. An untreated case
leaves the female sterile.“

concerned about possible infec-
tion to immediately contact the

’Time of Life’

by ARTHUR ROSENBERG
Drama Critic

A surprising thing to most
theatre goers who venture into
the lniversity Theatre is that

what they see is not only com-

parable to. but is in most cases ,

superior to the “so called" pro-
tessional theatre in the area.

. It is often assumed that tliea—
tre at the [niversity is amateur
and tar less professional than
shows seen at other theatres such
as the .\'ixon. Playhouse or Ben
tirosss. L'nfortunately. the only
difference is. in inany cases. the
price of the ticket.

The University of Pittsburgh
is also endowed with some of the
finest theatre talent in this area
and for many miles around. Their
directors and designers are not
only excellently traiiied but
have been continuously involved
in theatre for many years. In
the case of those who act in our
productions, it is true that they
are not professionals, but in many
cases they are far superior to
much of the talent seen in the
area.

The l'ni\'ersit\ Theatre will
present William Saroyan's prize-
winning play. The Timf of Your

Dr. (fanfield commented about
the upcoming production; ".\'ick’s

a menacing world just outside its

kind ol special dreams come

"A sentimental notion. ol

that should come as a relief lrom
the spate of propagandist hate
pieces and cheerless anti-plays
that have driven the audience
out of our theatres and brought
a once thriving profession to its
knees. The play speaks the sim-

 It is not often that.’ newspapers get a chance to laud news-

While shy spring hid behind Mother Winters skirts. our
much-maligned Weatherman endured the wrath of an entire

Pitt Stadium is made for football.
Only you’d never know it by Leo Bemis.

Bemis. the director of the in'tra—mural athletic program.
has, from the dark recesses of some inner logic. seen fit to
schedule softball games for the stadium.

That in itself is damnable enough. But Bemis. in his
infinite wisdom. has seen fit to schedule concurrent softball
matches on the 100-yard field.

The outfield mustnbe shared by two teams; sliding is im-
possible and dangerous.

When a player limps off the field with a possible crip-
pling injury, perhaps the idea will finally sink into Bemis’ . .

The Pitt News salutes the Book Center for its remarka-

Books and records have a way of disappearing over the

After his troops defeated the Romans at Asculum in 279
\B.C., King Pyrrhus was heard to remark: "One more such
victory over the Romans. and we are ‘utterly undone.“

Today, more than‘2000 years later, the University has

‘_ won another Pyrrhic victory, by remodeling its elevators.

We don‘t deny that University elevators ought to be jet-
fast and shiny. Nor do we deny that they should be made
safe for members of the University community.

Nevertheless. these plusses must be viewed in light of the
drawbacks of taking half the Cathedral elevators out of ser-
vice: longer waits; slower rides. larger crowds.

Housing is an example

. _....._....._....._....... ......_..___.-

by MIKE HALEY
Staff Columnist

Do you ever wonder why you keep get-
ting those loving letters from the Chancel-
lor informing you that your tuition
has been increased‘? (Again! t _

Well you might say. if you‘re liberal
enough to admit it. “Its because this ra-
cist imperialistic country that
tThe blank space is provided either for
the readers own creative self expression.

or contemplation}.

"Some of you more enlightened cyn-
ics will say. “Its because this over-sized
high school is mismanaged!"

,Some might even suggest tunder their
breath. of course» that it's the Chancell-
or's fault. Hi runs this place. Doesn't he?

Well, I think that last charge is a little
unkind. It’s not Wesley’s fault. That’s like
blaming the Queen of England for the cost
of living in Great Britain.

But you would have to be foolish or na-
ive to think he is the real authority at this
University. So it‘s not really fair tovblame
those people who are not responsible. or
to be more exact. those who do not exer-
cise their responsibility.

However. the few students who point
their finger at mismanagement for in-
creasing costs are closer to the truth. But
who‘s atfault‘?

It's obviously not the Chancellor. that
shining symbol of virture and good will.
My guess is that the blame rests with the
little guy who‘s a dean or who runs the
book store. For example. let's look at the
managerial exploits of John Vrana. the
Director of Housing.

But before we can judge Vrana we.

will have to gain some necessary insight.
The first insight to realize is that. if you
manage at the Lniversity. don’t. This ap-
proach dictates that if you have to make a
decision. appoint a committee to handle
it with their recommendations due by June
1. 1976.

If you have to sign something let .your
subordinate do it. If you dont want to be

‘fired. hire a lot of female students and

support some worthy cause. like maybe
Womens Lib. Admittedly your work might
suffer. but just think of all the good pub-
licity you'll get.

But if you as an administrator really
wanted to avoid your responsibility at
Pitt, take a trip to Africa or Asia and wor-
ry about the problems of somebody else’s
university.

Up to now I’ll admit that Vrana is pro-
bably not guilty of these sins.‘ But he
is guilty of the following transgression.
If some “oppressed“ economic. political.
or racial minority comﬁains or demon-
strates. don‘t bother finding consensus
to make a fair decision. Be smart; bend
with the wind.

That is exactly what “Vrana did. He has-
ically agreed with the requests made by
black Resident Assistants recently.

       

a mismana

 

JOHN VRANA

They made two requests: “that a black
housing administrator be hired. and that
blacks be represented on the various stu-
dent advisory boards that work with the
Housing Office.“ (for example the food
service committee). According to the
Pitt News Vrana is going to do both.

Now it would be unfair to simply judge
this decision on political grounds. Espe-
cially this one, because as our black bro-
thers might point out, we’re not black
enough. to understand. Plus, I agree in
principle that a black housing administra-
tor should eventually be hired.

But if you‘re wondering why we are
paying the second highest dorm rates in
the country. maybe you understand now.
With decisions like this one. costs cant
help going up. And I’ think we have the
right to judge Vrana's decision on fiscal
grounds. This right is ours because we pay
the bills. But what can you do‘.‘

Those of you who} are resigned to the
fact that we’ll have to pay more to get

less might decide to mimic the blacks.‘

If they can have their black representa-
tives why can't we have ours? -

For example. the University should
hire a drunken Irishman to make sure
our beverages are 100’. proof. A Chinese
consultant should be hired to supervise
the laundry to make sure our clothes real-
ly get clean. An Italian should be hired to
guarantee that Saga Foods serves som
goodlasagnanowandagain. . '

And if any "Americans" also want to
get on the dole. the uniyersith should
create a special committee for them. its
job would be to keep track of all of the
above un-American activities.

But for those of you who are sick and
tired of this whole mess, why don’t you
tell Vrana to forget it. That’s right. If he

wants a new employee (black or white)_

which we can't afford, he better fire
somebody_else on his staff.

Therefore. he won‘t increase costs. I
suggest he fire an athnic type. Why not
an Italian‘? No one will ever complain.
Oh by the way. Mr. Vrana. what is your
nationality? Could it be . . . ..  No. I
guess that‘s too much to hope for.

°Female Eunuch:’ Purging Polarization Perversities

I Greer Grills Sexism

Female Eunuch, Germaine Greer,
McGraw-Hill, $6.95.

“And must she drag the chain at
life in weary lust.’
—William Blake

Germaine Greer was born in a
bush fire in Melbourne. Australia.
Quite an appropriate start for a
bat out of hell. a flibbertigibbet
feminist. who writes Female Eu-
nuch from the standpoint of.
"Men. your time is up! "

Unlike other feminists books.
Greers functions as a paradigm

WW-,‘.'or anyone in the counter-revol-

ution. Greer. however. is in her

element cursing sexual polarity‘

or crucifying female castration.
To Greer, the sexes are of a
single nature, doubly‘ named. With
sardonic humor, spliced with per-
sonal experiences, she writes on
women’s cultural history, psycho-
logical development, and the per-
petuation of myths about them.

The onus of women is to free
men from their own "polarization
perversities." Yet before women
can do this’. they must free them-
selves from their apple pieshells.

Greer ingenuously or fiiirp<isely'
clouds her definition of what a

- woman should be. but with person-

al indignation belts. "I'm sick of
pretending eternal youth. I‘m sick

of belying my own intelligence. or
my own will. my own sex . . . I‘m

sicl of being a transvestite. I re-

fuse to be a female impersonator

. .  Her point: women should stop

making "exhorbitant efforts for

superhuman beauty while accept-

ing her males pot-belly. bad breath
and farting.

    

Greer is a hurricane with an eye
and sharp cerebro for attacking
absurd social contrivances. "If
men continue thinking that wom-
en are molded into cookies that
should crumble, they are suffer-
ing from fruit cake of the mind.
Unfortunately, many women as-
sume this role, because they know
love as only a consumer product.

Consequently. they habitate the
twilight world of insecurity. be-
cause of the myth that love and
marriage promises security. The
author questions this myth and
asserts that it causes the rate
of female sucicides and admit-

Summer Sign-up Now

The University's Office of Summer Sessions is conducting reg-
istration for its series 01] courses which begin on .June 22 and end

August 12.

Courses offered represent most university departments and in-
clude introductory cogurses in such fields as anthropology. biology.
black studies. mathematics. psychology and English composition and

literatire. as

well as more advanced courses.

Several budiness-

related career development programs are also available in the sum-

H181’.

Although most students attending summer sessions are already

tance into mental hospitals to be
higher than males.

With shades of Ayn Rand. al-
truistic love is condemned. ex-
trafamilial affection applauded.
female narcissism defended and
marriage abominated. "If mar-
riage and family depend upon the
castration of women let them
charge or disappear."

Sex is not attacked, but the atti-
tudes surrounding it are. Why
must a secretary be only an at-
tractive piece of furniture supply-
ing bed and board for her boss?
Why must every female aperture
be deodorized? "Why is “cunt" the
most degrading epithet outside the
dictionary?

Germaine Greer is threaten-
ing our present marshamallow so-
ciety. with punches aimed at sink-
ing deep within it. She does not
wantto toast or burn male aggres-
sors but to char the social system
that has enslaved women to the
hearth. Before both of the sexes
can correct society. one must take
the lead in reassessing sexual
patterns. Since men have not done
it. women must. The key to the
strategy of liberation lies in ex-
posing the situation and the sim-
plest way to do it is to outrage the
plundits. Germaine knows how.

Model 11w. is now $179.95
Model 26 is now $229.95

During the recent (and first) KLH sale many people were disappointed that it did not
include the outstanding models 11W and 26. Well theirwish has been answered with
savings of $30 and $40. These famous compact stereo systems are complete with speakers,
ampliﬁers, and phonographs, but no PM or AM. They were designed for people who
are interested in playing records and not the radio. Yet FM or tape can be added later
if you change your mind. The 11-w is the non-portable, but equally compact, walnut ver-
sion of the famous model 11, which (if you remember your KLHistory) was the world’s
first high performance portable stereo phonograph. The model 26 is sort of a big brother
to the 11-W. lts ampliﬁer has double the power, its speakers are larger, and (if
possible) it sounds even better, particularly in a large room that you want to ﬁll
with concert level sound. Either stereo system makes the perfect QUALITY gift for
the graduate. Your personal KLH system will be completely checked out and adjusted
by the saff and service dept. of opus one. Sale ends June 15th. Bank-Americard, .\Iaster

Near Season’s End;

Tourney To Follow

by GEARY JOHNS

Intramural softball appeared to be anything but monotonous
as most of the games proved to be very close and were not decided

until the final few innings.

The Sociology Department defeated the Pharmacy School. 9-8.
in the seventh inning. The Pharmacists opened the game with
four runs in the first frame and continued to dominate the game

through the fourth inning. leading 4-3.

However. the Sociologists stun-
ned the losers with five tallies in

"'.'ne fifth and eventually rallied

‘to win with one run in the sev-
enth.

ther baseball team had a

ters conclude their schedul-
ed season against = the Alle-
gheny team. Game time
for the home finale is 3:00
P.M.

Seniors playing their fin-
al home contest are Bob Sol-
onickne. John Fredland. and
Frank Mincarelli Solonickne
started as a pitcher on the
squad but switched to right
field two years ago. and
served as captain of the team
this season.

Fijedland saw limited ac-
tion in the outfield in the
past two seasons as a re-
serve, but has played well
as a starter in every game
this year.

Mincarelli pitched for the
team the past two seasons
since he transferred from
Tulane University.

So far this spring, Coach
Lewis‘ mitters have racked
up a 17-8 record.
