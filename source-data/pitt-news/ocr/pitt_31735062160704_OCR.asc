THE UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

Party Platforms Set;
‘Slates Follow Soon

B)’ MURRAY CHASS

V Year-round political parties are a part of the platforms
of both the Allied Collegiate (Party and the United Indepen-

dent Party.

Both parties had stated last week that their organizations
would continue to function after the Mar. 26 elections, but
they have made their intentions more deﬁnite with the inclu-

sion of it in theiriplatforms.

The‘UI Party does not include

“speciﬁc planks” in its

I program while the AC Party lists ﬁve functions they intend

_,£ .

v.

 

to carry out.

UI Team Maps
3-Point Policy

V A t h r e e —-point program

makes up the platform of the

United Independent Party.
David Breakstone, member

of the UI Central Committee

and party spokesman, in re-

leasingrthe platform commended:
“We don’t feel at this time that
there are any speciﬁc planks which

can honestly be advocated.”

“Political promises will only
be made if there is any possi-
bility of their being carried out.”

The complete platform follows.

“1. The party (United Independ-
ent) will represent 100 per cent
of the student .body—not 80 per
cent, the independents; or the 20
per cent, fraternities.

, 2. The only people who will be
slated are representative; proven
workers from all areas of under-
graduate activities.

3. The party will be a year-
round political organization to
promote interest and participa-
tion in school politfcs for all
students. It will also encourage
interest in local, state, and na-
tional politics as they affect stu-
dents. The appearance of Harold
Stassen is the first of this pro-
jected plan.”

The UI party accepted nomina-
tions for slating at its open meet-
ing in the Student Union last
Wednesday.

Both parties will announce their slates this Wednesday.

Collegiates See
Relations Role

L Recognition of the boun-
daries of student government

and an intended role in the

University’s public relations
program highlight the plat-
form of the Allied Collegiate
Party.

In the two-part program, the
partyplists matters in which it‘
feels students cannot play a part
and also those matters in w ich
they do have a say.

Of the platform and future cam-
paign, Campaign Manager Bert’
O’Malley said, “Our campaign is
under way with the release of .a
logical, concrete platform, rather
than one based on vague generali-
zation and high-sounding pro-1
mises. -

“Our next objective will be to
insure the student body of a
slate composed of well-qualiﬁed
candidates. Having achieved
this, our campaign will proceed
on the merits of the individual
candidates." '

Here is the AC platform, in
whole.

“We of the Allied Collegiate

~Party believe that student gov-
/ernment should be constituted as

a working example of democracy
and should .be based on the fol-
lowing principles. A

versity Health Center has been announced by Chancellor Ed-
Ward Litchﬁeld. H

Allied Platform
Includes Public

Relations Role

(Continued from Page 1)
We believe that it should not be
the primary purpose of student
government to attempt to unduly
influence the administration in
areas in which their responsibil-
ity and authority are paramount.
Included in these are such
matters‘ as the alteration of. the
physical plant. the appointment
of University personnel, dicta-
tion on athletic policies, and
others. . '

Therefore we will not pledge
ourselves to undertake programs
in the areas where the possibilities
of realization arelimited.

2. Recognition of the areas in
which student government can
most; eﬂectively act:

These areas include the ex-
pression of student opinion and
the maintenance of a vital chan-
nelof communication. To this end
we advocate: _(l) year-round po-
litical parties; (2) the promotion
of ‘the free participation of all
students in the assemblies of stu-
dent government; (3) the cultiva-
tion of the present and the de-
velopment of new means for the
expression of student opinion; (4)
active support of and participa-
tion in the University’s public re-
lations program; and (5) to pro-
vide the electorate with a choice
of experienced and responsible
students. ,

It is our opinion that this ap-
proach is a realistic one, cap-
able of accomplishment and one
to which our candidates .are
committed.” ‘

At the same time they released
the platform, the Allied Collegi-
ates announced that they will
hold a political rally this Thurs-
day, Mar. 13, starting at 3 p.m.
in the Ballroom of the Student
Union. E ,.

The Executive Committee and
the inter-university council of the
Institute for Social Gerontology
met at the University of Pitts-
burgh from Mar. 7 to 9.

The University is one of the

bership in the Institute.

 

Institute To Meet Here -

The purpose of the Institute is

economic aspects of aging.

Melpar’s sure, swift growth during

the past eleven years — we have

doublcd in size every 24 months -
is due, in large part, to the out-

’ standing performance of our ‘engi-

neering staff.

As a leading R & D organization,
we are constantly called upon to
perform tasks which have never
been done before. -Thanks to the

, creative talent which forms the

backbone of our organization, we
have grown rapidly both in stature
and ‘size. Members of our staff
have enjoyed similarly reward-

, ing growth.

Performance Determines Ad-

vancement. Individual recogni-
tion is a fundamental policy at
Melpar. Each engineer is advanced
on the basis of his performance.
The average age of our engineer-
ing staff (one of the industry’s
youngest) and the rapidity of
growth of above-average staff
members, are clear indications of
what Melpar’s individual recogni-

_tion policy can mean to you.

member you will enjoy the oppor-
tunity to participate in entire

to eventual managerial’ responsi-
bility.

Panthers Meet -Redskins
To Open NCAA Playoffs

By DAVID BREAKSTONE

basketball team makes its second N.C.A.A.

tournament appearance in as many years tomorrow night.
The locals encounter Miami of Ohio, Mid-American Con-

ference champions, at Northwestern University. The game

is one of two in the Midwest Regional elimination bracket.
The Redskins of Miami went undefeated in conference

The Panther

competition and compiled
overall mark of sixteen wins and
eight losses. The caliber of the
conference competition was not
_.exceptional and the Miamians
showed to only fair advantage
against “top notch” opponents.
Redskins Seen In Bowl

Many Pittsburgh fags got 'a
glimpse of the Redskins in Dec-
ember at the Steel Bowl Tourney.
Against Duquesne, the taller
Miami team played a hustling,
unimaginative game which re-
sulted in a 77-66 loss. The next
night, they recouped their losses
partially by upending George
Washington 66-64, in overtime.

The Steel Bowl exhibition
conﬁrmed the fact that 6-8
Wayne Embry represents" the
Redskins’ only real threat, of-
fensively and defensively.

The ambidextrous senior was
the high scorer for the, Indians
during the regular season, netting-
better than 23 points per game.

‘In addition he captured better
, than 30% of his team’s rebounds.
Brown Late Developer

Aiding Embry tomorrow will be
6-0 John Powell, 6-3 Jim Thomas,
6-6 Eddie Wingrad, and 6-6 Bill
Brown who has developed quick-
ly late in the campaign to assume
a minor share of the scoring re-
sponsibility.

Coach Dick Shrider’s basket-
‘eers will also be making their
second consecutive appearance

. in the N.C.A.A. extravaganza.
Last time out. they bowed to
Notre Dame 89-77 in the first
round.

Interestingly enough, if the
Jungle Cats claw the Redskins,

.they will probably face another
excellent Notre Dame team the
following night.

Hennon Carries’ Hopes

an¢

son, Hursh was his own worst

The Panthers, sporting a re-

spectable 18-6 record, will be
slight favorites to stay in the tour-
ney at least another night. The
basis for this optimism lies heav-
ily with the heralded Don Hen-
non, now a bona ﬁde A1l-Amer-
ican.

The all-time Panther great
may prove that pressure is nec-
essary to produce a winner and
spur the locals to new highs in
performance. _

However, tournament play has
never been an individual affair.
If the Timmons aggregation hopes
to play a few‘ games after Miami,
it will have tovbank on a “left
ﬁeld” performance similar to that
provided last year by John Riser.

Need Riser Repeat

- The husky native of Washing-
ton, Pa., responded to the com-
petitive challenge with two of the
finest games of his collegiate
career. A repeat of this effort may
be required of two of the Panth-
ers,.to remain in the runing.

Co-captains Jules Pegues and
Chuck Hursh hold the keys to-
tournament success. If Pegues
can ﬁnd the range consistently
and Hursh can be inveigled in»-
to shooting more often, the prob-

lem may be near solution. Dave , A

Sawyer and John Mills will
complete the starting quintet.
With the advent of tourney
play, Hursh, the 6-6 forward from
Irwin’s 1954 state Class B cham-
pions, may come into his own.
Everyone realizes that up until
the last month of the regular sea-

enemy.

The frail-looking towhead com-
mitted an unnecessary number of
borderline fouls and was hinder-
ed in many contests by three per-
sonals early in the first half.

that cerebration can overcome
frustration. By carefully pacing
himself and taking the shooting
and rebounding initiative more
often, Hursh came to be instru-
mental in team victory.

Particularly, Hursh’s rebound-
ing help proved to be the decisive
factor in the Navy and Penn State
conquests. If Hursh pulls a “Ris-
er” and smooth Pegues is zeroed
in; well —— tell them that you
heard it ﬁrst here!

Happy news!
