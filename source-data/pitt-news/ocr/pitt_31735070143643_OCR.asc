For T/ac Pitt New

Anyone who has printed some-
thing in a Pitt campus computer
lab has probably, at one time or
another, had to wait in line for it.

Starting in mid—to-late Septem-

ber, however, Pitt students won’t ’

have to wait in line for lab com-
puters .to print’ documents they
had on their personal computers.

“[CSSI5] wants to make sure

that the product is as close to _
_ perfect as possible beforebeing

released in every lab,”- said Jinx
Walton, director of Computing
Services and Systems Develop-
ment. 0 ._
In an effort to combat traffic
in computer labs, the University
will soon be implementing an al-
ternative self—service, printing
method. for Pitt students.

I Beginning with two printers in
David Lawrence and three print-
ers in Posvar Hall, the new test
pilots will allow students living on
or ‘off campus to print to either
of ' these computer labs via wire-
less PittNet. '

\X/ith the Democratic and Republi-

ing momentum and attracting attention
throughout the last week of August and
early days of . September, it’s no surprise
that Sen._Barack Obama’s and Sen. John
McCain’s vice presidential nominatioris

' are generating conversation.

In last Friday’s edition, the photographs
in “Reaction to Sen. Barack Obarna’s
acceptance speech” were incorrectly
paired with two students’ quotations.
The photo attributed as Mike DeDad
was of Adam Wubbolt, and the photo
marked as Wubbolt was of DeDad.

The Pitt News regrets the errors.

Absentee ballot Voting lOl

by Molly Stieber
For The Pitt New

\X/ith the presidential election
right around the corner, many Pitt

students have felt the registration V

pressure from every direction.
However, many college stu-
dents have already registered to
vote in their hometown and do not
choose to take the time to register
to vote in Pittsburgh. For those
voters, there is another option: the

‘ absentee ballot.

Registering for an absentee bal-
lot may sound foreign or intimidat-
ing, but every student and teacher
here at Pitt who will be away from
his hometown on Election Day
qualiﬁes foran absentee ballot.

Eligibility for an absentee ballot
applies to individuals who will .be
away from the residence in which
they are registered to vote during
the entire period the polls are open
for voting. Others who qualify in-
clude those who cannot attend the
polls because of military duties,
religious holidays, serious illness or
disability. ‘

Despite the eligibility of many

Pitt student-s, student Lissa Geiger
had some advice regarding absen-
tee ballots versus registering to
vote on campus. .

“I’ve been doing on—carnpus
voter registration, and it is the best
way to register to vote. The Penn-
sylvania state secretary general has
said that students have a right to

vote at their campus address,” said

Geiger. ~

Geiger also said she believes
that: because students are living
here during November, it makes
much more sense to vote in per-
son.

Any person from any state can
change his address to vote as long
as he will be living at that new ad-
dress for at least 30 days prior to
the election. This should apply to
almost all students at Pitt.»

“Absentee ballots are way too
complicated. I voted by absentee
once in the fall of my freshman
year, and itwas so hard,” said Gei-
ger. 7 5
“Basically, it is three separate
deadlines, all of which are easy for
college students to miss. Let’s be
honest, many college students have

trouble remembering deadlines for
their homework,” she said.

For those who wish to vote via
absentee ballot, the voter must first
contact the County Board of Elec-
tions ofﬁce in his hometown or
place of previous registration. The
voter may either download the ap-
plication or have one sent from the
office. ,

The deadline to apply for an ab-
sentee ballot is the Tuesday prior to

L the election. The County Board of

Elections office must then receive
the absentee ballot by 5 p.m. on the
Friday prior to Election Day.

In order for the absentee ballot
to be counted, the form must be
correctly completed and delivered
promptly to the County Board of
Elections. If these standards are
not met, it may result in the absen-

tee ballot being challenged and/or

set aside by the County Board of
Elections.

“It’s just easier to ﬁll out one
[registration] form that takes two
minutes and then show up at the
polls on campus or near your
apartment on Election Day,” said

Geiger.

“Biden is likely to ﬁll the attack-dog

Before McCain formally announced his

pick Mitt Romney as his running mate to
also shore up his resume.

was even quoted last year as saying that he
doesn’t know much about the economy.

' Romney is a successful businessman. He’s

appealing, ran well in the primaries and is
a strong campaigner.”

Although Victor said that Vice Presi-
dent Dick Cheney possesses much more
power, inﬂuence and control of policy in
the Bush administration than the majority
of other vice presidents throughout his-

tory, the next vice president is likely to play

small but highly important roles in helping
to deliver the kinds of policies that are im-
portant to college students.

These kinds of policies include the
continuously soaring costs of college tu-
ition and oil.

These particular policies, however, will
ultimately be affected by whether the Re-
publicans or Democrats control the White
House and Congress, rather than the vice
presidential selections.

Nevertheless, Victor acknowledged that

there are deﬁnite beneﬁts to caring about
these candidates and learning more about
their unique backgrounds and beliefs.

“If young voters take an interest in the
role their government will play in their
future, whether for personal ﬁnance and
consumption, civil rights and civil liberties,
or foreign policy and America’s role in the
world economy, then it’s important to get

Pitt newcomer Kristen Pierro is already
beginning to experience the chaos of cam-
pus printing. She said that the new CSSD
program seems “efficient and will make
it easier for students to pick up and print
documents.”

A similar off—campus printing idea was
introduced last year by Pitt senior Corey
Bonnell.‘ Using Pitt’s UNIX timesharing
server, Bonnell’s program also allows stu-
dents to print from outside computer labs,
although some glitches with connections
and printer malfunctions have occurred,
said Bonnell.

Although alike in theory, Bonnell’s pro-
gram sends documents directly to lab print-
ers, whereas the University’s new pilot will
give students the option of cancelling jobs

  Palin’s appeal
McCain's W3])z'né brings needed image c/mnge

Gov. Sarah Palin is the exact

— opposite of Sen. John McCain:

She’s young, energetic and a

V complete newcomer to national
M politics. A majority of Americans

wouldn’t have recognized her
name if you’d said it before last
Friday, which only made it more
of a shock when McCain an-

R nounced her as his vice presiden-
' tial pick for the 2008 presidential
V election.

In many ways, Palin is exactly

e What McCain’s campaign needed.

Her youth negates many of the

1 criticisms that McCain’s cam-
, paign is too old and stodgy, and

her far—right conservative values
give some balance to what many
see as a centrist attitude.

What remains to be seen,
though, is if the American public

i will see her as a genuine move to

balance his campaign or simply

 a clever trick designed to lure in
; Hillary Clinton supporters and

 far-right conservatives.

In one sense, it could be both.

 McCain appears to be addressing
; some of the major concerns that
 critics and voters have levelled at
: him, citing his advanced age, cen-
§ ter-leaning policies and perceived
? closeness to President George W
 Bush as negatives. Picking a run-
 ning mate who exhibits none of
 these qualities should help quiet
 the critics, although it has also in-
‘ spired the Obama camp to criti-

cise Palin’s lack of experience,

I the same charge that McCain’s

campaign previously directed at

, Obama.

That’s not to say that Obama

R isn’t covering his bases — Sen.

Joe Biden has been a senator

I in Delaware since 1973, which

makes it difﬁcult for anyone to

say Obama’s ticket is inexperi- E

enced — but McCain’s choice i

seems designed to represent a 

much wider swath of the conser— =

vative voter base than Obarna’s
does for Democrats.

McCain has a larger image %

problem than Obama, especially
among his hard-right conserva-
tive base. Many conservatives see

McCain as strongly centrist, to the 3
point where they might have pre— 
ferred staying home in November 
over going to the polls. But with 

the addition of Palin to his ticket,
large numbers of these far-right

voters suddenly have a reason to ;

turn up on Election Day.

And it’s nearly impossible to
look at Palm without seeing a
minor grab at the center—line vot-
ers who were originally attracted
to Clinton. Even though Clinton
solidly endorsed Obama, many
voters might see Palin, a mother

of ﬁye and committed pro—life 
family woman, as a surrogate i
Clinton who represents female 
values in a way that Obama can’t 

simply by virtue of his gender.

Above all, Palin appeals to 
middle-class conservative Ameri- 
cans. She hunts, she ﬁshes, she 
has a big family — including one 
son in the military and another 

born with Down syndrome — ‘

she’s young, and she’s a fresh face ;

in national politics. To quote Mc— 
Cain himself, “She’s exactly who I i

need.”

It’s impossible to say what sort ;

of effect Palin will have on Mc— E

Cain’s campaign come Novem-
ber, but he is making an effort
to broaden his support base and
address criticism with one clever

play. Now all that remains is to 

see whether it will work.

Russia has strategy for Georgia

\X/hen Russia escalated the

gian government and Russian
loyalists in South Ossetia in early
i August, no one was surprised. Sol-

diers, politicians and journalists
were all expecting an explosion
of violence in the weeks leading

ately called for Russia’s departure
from the contested regions, and
President George W Bush called
the action “unacceptable.”

It may be unacceptable, but the
United States wasn’t postured to
intervene in any way, and Russia
chose to move when it did for a
reason. It would be almost impos-
sible to justify, militarily or moral-
ly, any kind of action on our part
over such a contained conflict.

 the inexcusable Russian invasion

that followed.

It’s difﬁcult ﬁnding much sup-
port for the Russians at home or
abroad, and NATO and most of
the European Union have con-
demned the invasion. Both of the
presidential candidates immedi-

and our own mounting debt from
these ventures, Medvedev knew
better than to expect an irnmedi—
ate response. \

And it looks like his gamble
has paid off —, mostly.

A successful campaign has
proved that Russia is still the
dominant military power of Asia,
and despite Georgia’s overcon-

ﬁdence in the days leading up to
the ﬁghting, it is still a few weight
classes above all the breakaway
Soviet states in terms of military
power.

Russia’s timing was right on,
but the United States played a daft
hand last week by announcing the
successful results of back—and—
forth 18-month negotiations to
place interceptor missiles in P0-
land designed to protect against
rogue states like Iran _and North
Korea. Plans for the shield involve
placing Patriot missiles —— the type
designed to intercept short-range
missiles and destroy them before
reaching a target — just 180 kilo-
meters away from western Russia.

The issue has long been a con-
tentious one between Washington
and Moscow, but now the United
States can use Russia’s own ag-
gressive behavior to justify the
defensive missile shield’s presence
in central Europe.‘

Russian objection to the rr1is—
sile shield’s placement dates back
to Putin’s presidency, and it was
one of the few low points in an
otherwise solid relationship with
the Bush administration. Medve-
dev has not wasted a moment in
declaring absolute opposition to
it, claiming the shield is there not

strike, but to spread U.S. military
inﬂuence a little too close to Rus-
sian soil.

One of Russia’s leading gener- . ,

als, Anatoly Nagovitsyn, warned
that Poland is “exposing itself to a
strike —— 100 percent” by allowing
the system on its land. Medvedev
scaled back the directness of his
general’s threats against Poland
in the past few days, but it hasn’t
eased the worries of concerned
Poles. .

_ On top of the fear that Rus-I
sia couldcarry out a strike against
Poland is the possibility that the

interceptor missiles simply wonft
perform as anticipated. “It’s not

' something Europe can rely on,”

said Philip Coyle, a senior adviser
at the Center for Defense Infor-
mation in Washington. “It is not
dependable  [the system] is a
scarecrow” .

Coyle’s criticisms are not un-
reasonable -— the missile system
isn’t perfect and isn’t designed to
‘interceptall types of missiles. But

Dear Editor, J _ ‘

V The column from Aug. 28,“‘Israel, America Share Colonial Past,” contains numerous errors, generalizations
and omissions that are not only inappropriate within the confines, of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but: also of-
fensive to many supporters of Israel, including those who are against the settlements.

Israel is not a “settler nation.” Israel is a diverse country that was created by the United Nations in 1948, and
today it is the only ﬁinctioning secular democracy in the l\/ﬁddle East. Israelis, both Jewish and Arab,  within

I the pre-1967 borders are not settlers —— they are citizens. Settlers live in the West Bank, which Israel captured during

the 1967 war. Furthermore, the issue of settlements-is just one piece of the Israeli-Palestinian puzzle and must be
viewed as suchin order to  a better understanding of the issue and of the conﬂict as a whole.

I To be blunt,’ many of the settlers  in the West Bank are ultra-nationalist and ultra-religious fanatics. They
have their own ideologies and laws, their own societal support systems and often their own violeni militias. They are
scattered allgthrouighout the West Bank, and their homes range ﬁom Western-style housing tracts on the outskirts
of Jerusalem to shacks made from old cargo containers perched on a hilltop.

Many of the settlers living in the West Bank would return to Israel on their own if they were given a ﬁnancial

incentive t_(’_i)_>t'¢]:_l_:l1.",I1.__ Indeed, many of them are abandoning their ultra—nationalist ideology for a more pragmatic

expression of their respective Zionist movement. Furthermore, the Israeli public and Diaspora Jewry are becom-
ing more and morevgalvanized against the settlements because of the recognition that Israel’s long—term security

-is tied to a withdrawal from the West Bank and the creation of a Palestinian state. Even thelsraeli prime minister,

Parliament Supreme Court have stepped in to stop the creation of new settlements and the expansions of
current ones. is I ’ - . e i , ’,

But despite this, the settlements continue to expand. Israel is not armexing the territory that most settlements
are built on. Instead, settlers are  and are expe_,cting,the Israeli government to reluctantly protect them with
the Israel Defense Forces from their angry Palestinian  It is the settlers ~t_hemselves who construct illegal‘
outposts’ and additions to  settlements,'not the Israeli government through" its institutions. The settlers do
this because they are agroup that chooses _to isolate itself from Israeli society and has its own agenda that must 
stopped if we hope toachieve peacein our lifetime. ‘ i A

The author is‘ correct: Settlement expansion is an obstacle to peace. However, it is not the sole obstacle. There is
no single obstacle, whether itis settlement expansion or terrorism, that prevents the implementation of a peaceful
two—state solution, and to assert otherwise is not to understand the Israeli—Palestinian conﬂict in its entirety /

‘V Dear Editor:

The Pitt football team walked into the preseason with “Prove It” smeared across their T-shirts. Indeed, after
Pitt’s  upset of .West Virgina last December, the team had something to prove: They weren’t a fluke and
just‘ gave the Big Eastia reason to be fearful in competition throughout the next year. _

Unfortunately, the only  they proved is that anyone who orderedthe $25 season tickets should demand a
refund. I love my school, and I believe that we consistently cultivate talent in both the classroom and on the field.
But this is ridiculous. _ ' - V

Dave Wannstedt’s best attribute he brings as ‘coach of our football team is thathe has a knack for recruiting
some of the best players in the nation, year after year. But if you can’t capitalize on that talent, what’s the point?

I was planning on inviting a ftiend from Bowling Green to spend the weekend here while he witnessed the utter
destruction of his school’s football team, but now I’m glad I didn’t. - A

Our sports dollars and tuition money go toward paying Wannstedt’s salary, yet every year ——  amazing tal-
ent —‘we’re always “rebuilding.” There’s no excuse this time an experienced lineup. It’s time to ﬁnd a new
coach. '

gladly sang along during nearly every song.

“Life is a Highway” might be a cover
song, but the fans were clearly apprecia-
tive that the group played its version, as
the crowd was most vocal during this song
than during any other played that evening.

’ The reigning ‘Country Music Associa-
tion Vocal Group of the Year tried to cram
too many songs into its set, unfortunately.
This led to abbreviated versions of crowd
favorites “I’m Moving On,” the tear—jerking
“Skin” and “Feels Like Today.”

But the most disappointing aspect of
the evening was the decision of the group
to leave out one of its biggest hits, the
back—in—the—day—type song “Mayberry.”

Thankfully, the lack of “Mayberry” was
the only negative aspect of the evening.
Rascal Flatts rocked the Pavilion from the
ﬁrst song to the last.

The band presented not only its vocal
talents but also its musical talents. Rooney
performed several solos on electric and
acoustic guitar, and the band’s instrumen-
talists also demonstrated their honorable
skills.

It also paid a respectable "amount of
attention to those sitting way back in the
lawn, especially in “Here’s To You,” a tune
that gives a tribute to the “guys up there,”
an allusion to those in the nosebleed seats
or the lawn.

The group returned to the stage for a
two—song encore that included the wild
“Me and My Gang” and “Bob that Head,”

the song for which its tour is named.

The atmosphere in Burgettstown was
heated not only from the weather, but also
from some of the hottest and most rowdy
music that the Post—Gazette Pavilion has
seen all summer.

The headlining Rascal Flatts put on an

She frequently reminded the enthusias-
tic crowd of her Pennsylvania roots as she
brilliantly belted out her songs. When the
crowd gave her a deservingly raucous cheer
after each song, she was bashfully modest
about the crowd’s reception, and she might
have even blushed a few times.

Swift has come extremely far in country
music throughout the past few years, and it
is clear that she is.still extremely grateful to
her fans for her success.

After she ended her set with the angry-
ex-girlfriend anthem, “Picture to Burn,”
her home—state crowd gave her a well-justi-
ﬁed deafening applause. S

Swift clearly did her job of warming up
the crowd for «Rascal Flatts, as there were
fans dancing in their seats and on the lawn
during intermission while waiting for the
headliners to start their set.

Suddenly, Rascal Flatts band members
Jay DeMarcus, Gary LeVox and Joe Don
Rooney exploded onto the stage playing
their latest hit, “Still Feels Good.” ’

coffee. And I thought it was hilarious, so I just
started 

TPN: So this might be an obvious ques-
tior1, but where do you get your ideas for the
topics?

CL: When it hits you, it hits you. I use
people I went to grad school with, I went to
McGill with, and I ask, “Would they like this?”
If the answer is yes, then it’s in. And if I ever
need inspiration, I just go to the farmers mar-
ket ’

TPN: Considering the subject of your
book, there’s been some criticism to it. Have
you yourself received any kind of negative re-
sponses from people?

CL: Yeah, tons. It’s almost entirely from
idiots. It’s usually people who are utterly hu-
morless, is a good way to put it. Who don’t get
what it’s about, what I’m  to do with it.

Some people call me a racist, which is my
favorite one. I absolutely love that. For once
you’re offended that I made a broad gener-
alization about your race that you’ve never
heard before. Ask anyone else from any other
race  they’ ve never dealt with that before. If
the harshest criticism is that I’m racist to white
people, then I can deal with that.

The criticisms that I’m not a good writer,
that I’m not funny, those are just from people
who are jealous.

TPN: So then are you  to make
some kind of social commentary, or is it just
something you do for fun?

CL: First and foremost, comedy is my top
priority. It has to be funny above all else. The

whole  is really about me in terms of
making fun of myself. Sort of cathartic, you
know,  “Your brother was right. You
are pretentious. Deal with it.”

TPN: The book has hit The New York
Times’ bestsellers list Does that feel surreal
to you?

CL: Surreal is exactly how it feels. None of
this feels real. I dreamt about having a book on
the bestseller’s list — is this really happening?
It’s happened.

TPN: So what’s next?

CL: I just want to be a comedy writer,
that’s it. I’m not a novelist — I don’t have the
great novel of our generation in me, it’s just
not there. If I can’t turn this into a comedy-
 job or career, then I was never talented
enough. I’ll say I tried and there was nothing

. more I could have done. I’ll find a regular job

and move back to Canada.

TPN: Fair enough. One last question, do
you stand still at concerts?

CL: Yes, of course. I’m not going to be
that asshole. I listen to, Belle and Sebastian-
type music; What are you going to do — sway
side to side? I do, I stand very still at concerts.
And I judge everybody who’s  If
you’re dancing, then I’m watching your every
move and making fun of you.

everything.

in development, which brings the total of
unnecessary “Pitch Black” sequels to four.
Whether these movies are relevant, their
existence alone is a good sign — Diesel
might be embracing his own awfulness.

It’s a big step for him. The burden of
the silly action star is a big one, and it takes
a special kind of actor to step back, take a
good hard look at himself and say, “Yeah,
I’m kinda lame.” Keanu Reeves did “Point
Break,” which was pretty much “Fast and

the Furious” with surﬁng. And he does .

some serious things, too, and that’s fine —
but it hasn’t stopped him from going over
the top with movies like “Speed” or “Con-
stantine.”

So here’s what you do, Vin. Get back to

your roots. “4 Fast 4 Furious” is the perfect
example. ,Now get Hollywood to make an-
other “xXx” movie, preferably about Tri-
ple—X on a mission to rescue an elite squad
of rollerblading spies. ’

Keep it up with the Riddick movies, too,
but crank up the heat a little —— maybe in

one of these sequels, Riddick will ﬁnally

bang Judi Dench?

And of course, don’t turn your back
on “Fast and the Furious” like you did
when you snubbed the first sequel. Ride
that wave as long as you can — I want to
be taking my grandkids to see “F45T and
the Furious,” the one about illegal electric
wheelchair racing in the halls of the nurs-
ing home.

Pitt tailback LeSean McCoy hangs his head after Pitt's 27-17 loss to Bowling Green. McCoy, who rushed for 71

V yards and one touchdown on 25 carries, said after the game that Bowling Green was simply the better team Saturday.

by Zack Chakan
Amaidtant Sparta Editor

Three years ago, Pitt entered
the 2005 season with  expecta-
tions after  head coach Dave
Wannstedt in the offseason. After
starting the year nationally ranked,
the Panthers lost their home opener
to Notre Dame and didn’t sniff a
winning season.

Fast forward to this past Saturday
at Heinz Field. A similar feeling float-
ed through Heinz Field, and an all-
too familiar result for Pitt fans came
about in No. 25 Pitt’s 27-17 defeat to
unranked Bowling Green.

Pitt’s Achilles’ heel proved to be
turnovers, with three of the four
coming in the second half. The Fal-
cons were able to capitalize withi14
points following the miscues.

"To say the least, I can’t tell you
how disappointed our football team

is, all of us are, from the standpoint g

strike against punchless Panthers

of how much work and effort was
put into the start of the season,” said

‘ \X/annstedt.

a ‘‘At  camp, we’ve protect-
ed the ball, we’ve done a good job on
turnovers, we’ve been smart with the
ball. And to go out there today and
put the ball on the ground several dif-
ferent ways against a team that can
score points, that makes it very dif-
ﬁcult”

Linebacker Scott McKillop
echoed his coach’s sentiments.

‘‘We’ve been saying all preseason
and all last season [that] whoever
wins the turnover  usually has
a  percentage [chance] to win the
game,” said McKillop. “That’s one of
the  we’ve got to work harder
on.”

Pitt did get an interception early
in the game from linebacker Austin
Ransom but still ended up with a
minus—three turnover ratio against

It was a weekend of hard-fought competition
for Pitt volleyball, as the team traveled south and
faced several top—ranking teams, including NO. 13
Wisconsin. _g

Pitt's third and final match against Western
Carolina was the first win for new head coach
Toby Rens

"There were a number of high-level rallies,
and we did a good job with it We won several
of the longer rallies," said Rens "I think that says
a lot for the focus and the fight that we have as
a team."

"I was very happy with an overly difficult task,
[playing] two top-25 teams back to back Ilearned
a lot about my team and their character, the fight
that they have and how competitive they are It's
great"

Rens and his Panthers will return home to
the newly renovated Fitzgerald Field House next
weekend to host the Pitt Classic

Kentucky 3, Pitt 2

After several comebacks and rallies from both
sides, Pitt lost its 2008 season opener to the Uni-
versity of Kentucky Wildcats, 3-2, with set scores
of 23-25, 25-19, 25-14, 22-25 and 21-19.

The Panthers started strong with a win in the
ﬁrst set, which was capped off with a kill from
sophomore Amy Town after numerous lead
changes. With a lead of 1-0, Pitt lost the second
and third sets, showing only a .086  per-
centage.

Pitt came back in the fourth set, even after be-
ing down 13-8 at one point in the game A 10-5
run from the Panthers tied the game at 18, and a
kill from senior Kelly Campbell gave Pitt at 23-22
lead. Pitt scored the ﬁnal two points and evened
the match up at 2-2.

The ﬁfth set, which usually onlygoes to 15
points, ended up  a much longer battle.

After seven ties between the teams, Kentucky
eventually took the last lead and started its tour-

nament with a win.

It shows that both teams were  hard
and nobody wanted to lose, said Rens I'm very
proud of my student athletes. We didn't give them
any freebies, we made them win their points

W'1sconsin 3, Pitt 0

Coming back in the morning after a fairly late
night to face No. 13 Wisconsin proved unsuc-
cessful for Pitt, as it dropped three sets in a row
to the Badgers, 25-19, 25-19 and 25-16.

The second setwas closest for Pitt, as it closed
an early 7-3 deﬁcit to one at 9-8. Wfisconsin then
rallied,  the score to 16-9 before senior]es-
sica Moses, who was praised for her work ethic
by Rens, recorded a kill to make it 16-10.

. The gap would close further at 21-17 before
the Badgers ran away with it and, eventually, the
match.

Town recorded 10 kills and seven  ir1
the match, and senior Nicole Taurence put up
13 points, six  and four block assists in the

contest
Pitt 3, Western Carolina 1

The Panthers held Western Carolina to a .171
hitting percentage in its only victory of the tour-
nament, with set scores of 26-24, 23-25, 25-22
and 25-19. .

Pitt had three more drives to
mount a comeback and moved into
Bowling Green territory each time
But a failed fourth—down attempt,
a missed 42-yard field goal by Conor

_K_Lee and an interception in the end

acne crushed Pitt’s chances

The Panthers had an early oppor:

tunity to go for a touchdown with 30
seconds left in the first half and the
game deadlocked at 14 apiece.

Insteadof  for a touchdown,
Pitt chose to run down the clock to
three seconds and kick a field goal. .

“We felt like we wanted points at
that point,” ‘said VX/annstedt:

“I think any time you’re in that

"situation and you’ve got a chance

at three points, you take the three
points '

‘—‘You could  an incomplete
pass, it gets deﬂected,’ a turnover, you
get sacked. Now you’re not 
your team a chance to win.”

Lee made the 36-yard attempt.

Bowling Green struck ﬁrstin the

second half. Anthony Turner ﬁn-
ished off a nine—play; 59-yard drive
with an 8—yard touchdown run from
the quarterback spot. Pitt blocked the
extra point, keeping the score 20-17.
Linebacker Shane Murray did
not play with a knee  and was
replaced by Ransom. Fellow starting
outside linebacker Adam Gunn left
the game with a concussion ‘after a
collision with Ransom. Nate Nix and
Greg Williams took Gunn’s place
“I’d belying if I said myself and
