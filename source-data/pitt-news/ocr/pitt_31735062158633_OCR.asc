At The .Next War
And Mobilization

"By s. SIDNEY KALWARY

Today war is unlimited. It
is no longer a matter of Simple
territorial ambitions or dynastic
quarrels. It is now a struggle
between rival national econom-
ic theories.

The imperialistic powers can
no longer depend solely upon their
armed forces for “defense.” They
must aim at the total defeat of_the
enemy. And to attain that end
the entire nation must be harnes-
sed to the war machine. And we,
the class of ’41 will be among the
first to be run over.

Plans for “industrial mobiliza-
tion” have become an integral part
of the war preparations of all the
great powers. In certain countries,
where the economic crisis has gone
deepest and which countries are
therefore openly contemplating
war, these plans have already
been put into effect.

In other countries, similar plans
are being held in abeyance, pend-
ing the outbreak of actual hostil-
ities. This is true both of Great
Britain and America. Of course,
those responsible for these prep-
arations never say they are mak-
.ing plans for a dictatorship. They
use more patriotic terminology in

describing their work. But theyl

are not patriotic.

‘Toward Dictatorship

Dictatorship is what they are
driving toward, for there is no
way of carrying out any of these
plans except through dictatorial
control. They are not thinking of
preserving our great heritage.
They desire to completely annihi-
late democracy.

The only dissension in the ranks
of the exponents of dictatorship is
the difference of opinion between
the military men and the finance
capitalists. Each group wants to
control the dictatorship that is to
be set up.

They do not disagree as to the
character or purpose of the proj-
ected “industrial mobilization.”

Dr. Bowman Holds
Annual Reception

Usher As Parents
Grades, Confer

With Instructors, Deans Of Schools

By RUGY ALDISERT
VVhile freshman students remain at home this evening hop-
ing for the best, some 1100 parents will assemble in the Com-
mons Room as guests of Dr. John G. Bowman, chancellor of the

The occasion is the sixteenth annual Chancellor’s Reception

Beginning at 8 o’clock, the honor guests of the evening will
be escorted from the Bellefield avenue entrance into the Com-

Rifles, ROTC honorary fraternity.
While the parents are assembling
a musical background will be pro-
vided by the Cathedral organist,
Russell VVickmann, of Shadyside
Presbyterian church.

GRADES DISTRIBUTED

Chancellor Bowman will then
personally greet the assembly with
the feature address of the evening.
Following his talk, the Men’s Glee
Club, under the direction of Theo-
dore M. Finney, will entertain.

Student aides, comprising both
men and women leaders in campus

cards to the individual parents. On
these cards will be the name of
the faculty adviser, grades of the
student, names of each instructor,
quality points, number of unex-
cused absences, and health ratings.
Row by row, the parents will
then be directed to second floor
classrooms, where instructors will
be stationed. Parents are urged to
confer with faculty advisers in
case marks are below average.

CONFER WITH DEANS
After the conferences with in-
structors, parents are invited to

.armistice in 1918, legislation was
enacted by Congress authorizing
‘the military men to put together
a framework for a more effective
and complete dictatorship in the
[event of another war.

Naturally, the blunt word “dic-
tatorship” was not actually used.
That word wou1dn’t exactly jibe
with our professed aim — in the
public school text books—in enter-
ing the World War to make the
world safe for democracy.

Everything Ready

Today, therefore, military lead-
ers have readied for Congress a
series of bills laying the ground-
work for what they call their “in-
dustrial mobilization plan.” Some
of these bills were written and
presented at the last session. Some
will be introduced at the next
session.

Copies of these bills are avail-
able for public consumption. But
we, the forty-oners, haven’t time
to investigate.

“We don’t wanna fight” ema-
nates from every corner of the Ca-
thedral. No, we don’t wanna fight,
nor do we want to exert ourselves
to defend our ideals. Freshman
Dance, Gable’s films, and ping-
pong tournaments press us for
time. We won’t do anything about
stopping preparations for war.
But don’t get us wrong. “We don’t
wanna fight!”

Senior Women
Will Assemble ,
At Luncheon

Senior women will meet for the
second time this year when they
attend their class luncheon at
Heinz House, Monday at 12:30
o’clock.

Irene Maroney, Ed, president of
the class, says, “The walk to Heinz
House is a hard one, but the good
time at the end will be worth it.
Last year the class of ’38 had a
capacity crowd at its Emerald
Luncheon.”

Admission for the event is 25
cents. Tickets have been on sale
since Tuesday and may be obtain-
ed from any member of the cabi-
net.

Those selling tickets are Miss
Maroney; Grace Kovacs, C; Jane
Key, C; Lorraine Stancliffe, Ed;
Ann Thompson, Ed; Betty Feich,
Ed; Harriet McFarland, Ed; Mar-
garet Sprecker, C; Martha Neitz,

in which their son or daughter is
enrolled. Dean E. A. Holbrook of
the School of Engineering and
Mines, Dean Leonard O"Connell of
the School of Pharmacy, Dean
Stanton C. Crawford of the Col-
lege, and Dean Charles S. Tip-
petts of the School of Business
Administration, will be in the
Commons Room.

A social period will follow, with
refreshments being served by stu-
dent aides.

This year’s reception, sixteenth
in the annual series, marks the
first time the Commons Room will
be used, previous receptions being
conducted in the Soldiers’ and
Sailors’ Memorial. Introduced by
Dr. Bowman in 1921, these affairs
have proven so successful from a
scholastic and social point of view
that other colleges and univers-
ities throughout the country have
adopted the idea.

STUDENT AIDES

The purpose of these assemblies
is to bring together parents and
teachers, the people who are most
interested in the student’s welfare,
according to Dr. Vincent W. Lan-
fear, dean of men and general
chairman of the faculty commit-
tee. “It gives an opportunity for
parents to discuss with instructors
questions of mutual interest per-
taining to the development and
progress of the first-year stu-
dents,” declared Dr. Lanfear.

members of Student-Faculty As-

sociation; Omicron Delta Kappa,

“Is there an American Lan-
guage?” will be discussed at
today ’s session of SFA-spon-
sored Student-Faculty Forum.
The meeting will be held in 24
Cathedral, beginning at 1
o’clock.

Dr. James B. Stinchcomb, as-
sistant professor‘ and acting head

with a 30-
minute address on the subject and
will conduct the open forum for
the remaining half hour.

OPEN FORUM

As in the three previous assem-
blies, today’s meeting will be open
to all students and faculty mem-
bers at the University. Milton
Lehman, C39, chairman, has asked
that all people who plan to at-
tend the forum be present at 1
o’clock, in order that the full hour

may be devoted to the Scheduled
discussion.

Recent interest in the question

 to be presented by Dr. Stinch-
' comb has been encouraged by cur-

rent theoretical analyses, among
which is the popular H. L. Menck-
en volume, “The American Lan-
guage.”

MENCKEN’S THEORY

Mencken contends that America
and Americans are developing an
idiom of expression that shows a
noted departure from the English
of Oxford. Another significant
point in which “American” Eng-
lish stands at variance with Ox-
ford is phoneldgywor ;pronouncia-
tion.

Dr. Stinchcomb, a specialist in
classic languages, has been per-
sonally interested in the linguistic
overtones developing in America.
He will analyze current theories
accounting for the differences be-
tween “American” and “English”
English, suggest possible future
developments, and present his own
views.

Following his address, Dr.
Stinchcomb will hear the theories,
arguments, and cross-questionings
of the audience.

age with no failures or incom-,
plete work. Regular attendance at]
mentor meetings and at eventsq
planned especially for freshmen]
during the first eight weeks of,
school, and a passing grade on the ‘
customs examination are addi-
tional requirements.

Before the presentation of the

plain the meaning of the panther
pins. Patsy Griffith, C40, will re-
present Father Pitt in the pro-
gram.

Undergraduate
Fund Pledges
Near Quota

At noon yesterday Community,
Fund subscriptions from students
amounted to $2,442.66, or over 90
per cent of their quota of $2700,
according to J . G. Quick, registrarl
and general chairman of the cam-
paign.

Included in the ﬁgure of $2,-
442.66 are the subscriptions from
the undergraduate schools and the
School of Dentistry. This ﬁgure
does not include the Schools of
Medicine, Law, and Pharmacy.

Also, not included in this report
are the results of the personal so-
licitation of students who were
not scheduled for a second-hour
class Monday or a third-hour class
Tuesday, conducted by a commit-
tee headed by Mrs. Sarah Miller
Barr, executive secretary of the
YWCA. Mr. Quick believes that
when this report and the reports
from the three professional schools
are made, that the students will
reach their quota.

Faculty members have sub-
scribed $5200, or 71 per cent,
against their goal of‘ $7300. Mr.
Quick praised the work being:
done by the members of the fac-
ulty committee, who, in spite of
their busy schedules, are devoting
much time and eﬁort to make the
campus camjaign a success.

Students who have subscriptions
to pay, can do so at the treasur-
er’s oﬂice, 8 State_hall. Mr. Quick
adds, “A subscription is a ﬁne
thing for a needy cause, but inas-
much as the average student sub-
scription is only one dollar, the
main thing is to pay it as soon as
possible.”

Parents’ Night Tonight

TONIGHT hundreds of parents of freshmen
will attend Chancellor Bowman’s annual re-
ception to discover the curricular and scholas-
tic standing of their sons and daughters.

And tonight, as in years gone by since the
annual affair was instituted, these parents, who
along with other parents of college students a
better understanding of the college student
than any other special group, may still be won-
dering about the thoughts and attitudes of
‘rlieir young collegians.

According to a large section of the American
piihlic that lies come of age, serves as heads of
.l":"lll:ll<?'\.‘, H: -is l_Il(‘. votes, and regulates the po-
IllI?(‘?}.l (‘f{‘iI.°"s‘(‘ mi‘ '.I'l€ nation, the typical college
midezii 1"-: .: i't‘!.‘l.~Il8adeCl iconoclast. At times the
label  varied: He may be a “liberal” or, more
startling, a. ‘ ‘ radical.”

Youth always has been classiﬁed thus ever
since the first. young person rebelled either
against the opinion of society or his parents.
Then, as now, he was iconoclastic.

The iconoclasts of the American campus to-
day are no diﬁerent. Among them we shall ﬁnd
creators of new household gods, perhaps new
forms of society. And these creators will stand
as stunchly before their idols as their parents
do now._7 The “old order changeth,” but no
more now than ever before.

So tonight we extend greetings to the par-
ents of freshmen, claiming that there is much
meaning in the things their youngsters do,
hoping that they will accomplish much.

Naw, They Dismantle

OMETIMES we wonder at the common de-

Courses Give Training
In Government Service

Dr. Charlesworth Heads Division
Offering Instruction For Public Ofﬁce

By GERALD ZISKIND

There has been a need, ever since the beginning of our na-
tional government, for capable and eﬂicient men to ﬁll its lesser
offices. Colleges, in the past, have completely ignored this ﬁeld
of training under the assumption that government positions re-

quire no speciﬁc mode of training.

While-Great Britain devoted great energy and money for

violating the Byrnes Act prohibiting transpor-
tation of strike-breakers across state lines.

The prosecution contends that 57 Bergoﬁ
einployess were sent. to Middleton, Conecticut,
in June, 1936, to break a strike at the Reming-
ton plant.

The stiff-collared defense attorneys claim
that Bergoff’s men were imported for the pur-
pose of “dismantling” the plant.

It would seem that a responsible corporation
like Remington-Rand would hire experienced
dismantlers. Bergoff has told of working for

Standard Oil, 'l‘idewater Oil, Carnegie Steel,
Goodyear, Goodrich, and Firestone rubber
companies; the only dismantling he has done
for them has been that of strikers’ homes and
families.

_l3-ergoif is not a secretive man. He has told
his methods of operation to newspaper inter-
viewers. His hired lieutenants, called “no-
bles,” direct the actual “dismantlers,” or
“ﬁnks,” men with prison records ranging
from murder and kidnaping to more assault
and battery. The ﬁnks use guns, lead pipes,
and baseball bats.

Pearl’s best job was dismantling the New

Orleans street car strike of 1929. The conduc-
tors who had walked out peacefully were try-
ing to negotiate when a car-load of Wreckers
came down from New York. Included in the
group were experienced workers, subsequently
identiﬁed as Stinkfoot McVey, Mouseface Lib-
by, Blackie Ryan, and Punk Brady.

Several days after the boys arrived, tracks
were torn up, strikers’ home bombed, men
were sluggcd in the streets, and two men shot’
——but they were not finks.

Remington-Rand was certainly taken in on
the deal if ‘they hired Bergoif to dismantle
their works. Somehow, we don’t think Berg-
off ’s men were quite the right type. Perhaps
the corporation lawyers who are now defend-
ing them should have been hired for the job.

Annual Nobel Prize

French Writer Receives Recognition

For Historical Romance ‘Etc 1914’

By ALICE BENOVITZ
This year the Nobel Prize for literature shifted from the
analytical, introspective plays of Eugene O’Neill to the care-

fully written novels of Roger

Martin du Gard, with the an-

nouncement of the award on November 11 from Stockholm,

Sweden.

M. du Gard can now be placed with Anatole France and
Henri Bergson, the last two Frenchmen to be honored by the

Nobel Prize.
German and French have had the
largest percentage of winners.
Consequently, with the return of
the prize to France, the people
there must be coming to think of
it as a national possession.

When the notice of the award
was published, very few Ameri-
cans recognized the name. But in
Paris where he lives, he is promi-
nent in a small circle of literary
intellectuals, among whom is An-
dre Gide, the well-known novel-
ist. He is also a member of the
board of Nouvelles Litteraires, a
French literary publication of
which his brother, Maurice, 7‘ is
editor.

M. du Gard has been writing
since 1909. In the last 26 years he
has produced numerous criticisms,
essays, and novels. “Jean Barois,”
published in 1913, permanently
established his fame as a writer.
His book, “La Veille France,” was
the best seller in France in 1933.

However it is his latest work,
“Etc 1914,” an extraordinary his-
torical novel published in 1936,
that won the Nobel award. This
book is the seventh in a series
known as “Les Thibau1t,” the ﬁrst
volume of which appeared in 1922.
These seven books which trace
the romantic history of —a family
resemble greatly in conception
Galsworthy’s “Forsyte Saga.”

“Etc 1914” is a powerful por-
trayal of the “struggle against
fate” by the helpless men and W0-
men caught in "the maelstorm of
the World War. Certain pages have
been compared to the description
of the burning of Moscow in Tol-
stoy’s novel, “War and Peace.”
Paul Nizan, a French critic says
of this book: ,

“‘Ete 1914’ is a novel of des-
tiny: each life in it is submitted
to the action of a power, invin-
cible and obscure, to a machine of
secrets, treaties of powers . . .”

Editor’s Note:

By William Colker

_. ' This is the last of a. series of articles concern-
ing the Pittsburgh composer, Step hen Collins Foster.

When Stephen Foster died in Bellevue Hospital, New York
City, on January 13, 1864, he must have considered himself a
failure. His songs were looked upon as merely popular melodies-
of the day, which would soon be forgotten.

Neither Foster nor contemporary America realized that his
songs of home possessed real merit.

The composer and his fel-

low countrymen could not’ look into the future and see that the-
music was to become immorta1,¢‘

and its writer to become famous.

And now, three-quarters of a
century after his death, Foster and
his music have come into their
own. Not that his songs had not
been sung-—far from it. But such
great American melodies as Old
Folks at Home, My Old Kentucky
Home, and a dozen others had
been practically ignored by the
professional musician and the
critic, even though they had be-
come an integral part of the peo-
ple’s existence.

CHANCELLOR COMMENTS

It was Chancellor Bowman who
recently stated, “These songs, like
the air we breathe, the water we
drink, and the sunsets we see, had
become so familiar to us that we
had ceased to give them much at-
tention. Special thought was re-
quired before we became consci-
ous of their importance or their
significance.”

And now Foster has been rec-
ognized by the professional musi-
cians, as well as by the people for
whom he sang. Within the last few
years, his ‘definitive biography
has been written, his complete
works have been republished, and
many modern arrangements of his
music have been issued. The radio
is broadcasting Foster music in
ever-increasing numbers.

Even Hollywood has become
conscious of Foster, with the re-
sult that one full-length movie of
his life has been made, as well as
a number of short pictures. None
of these pictures is particularly
accurate, but they furnish evidence
of the popular interest in the man.

A short time ago a special Ste-
phen Foster half dollar was issued.

BIOGRAPHY PUBLISHED

For 30 years after Foster’s death,

little or nothing was done to honor

him. His name was in danger of
being completely forgotten. But.
in the l890’s Foster’; brother MOI‘-
rison published the first Foster‘
biography, and included with it the
verses and music of about 150 of
Foster’s 201 original songs and.
compositions. (The discovery of
the balance of his works has been
one of the most fascinating chap-
ters in Foster history.)

A few years later, Pittsburgh
erected the Highland Park statue
of Foster, the work of Guiseppe
Moretti. And in 1914 another
Pittsburgh tribute, the Stephen
Foster Memorial Home at 3600
Penn Avenue, was established.
Here lived until her death in July,
1935, the only child of Stephen
Foster, Mrs. Marion Foster Welch.

In 1927, the Tuesday Musical.
Club, under the leadership of its
president, Mrs. Will Earhart, be-
gan the work which resulted in
the establishment of the Stephen
Foster Memorial of the University.

LILLY GIVES COLLECTION

Tremendous impetus was given
to the whole Foster movement
when Josiah K. Lilly of India-
napolis established his Foster Hall.
Collection. Since that time, Mr.
Lilly has been one of the leading
sponsors of various Foster activ-
ities throughout the United States.
His chief contribution towards the
Foster movement was the building
up of the largest collection of ma-
terial and information relating to
the life and works of Foster. This
collection was given in trust to the
University in 1937.

Faculty and students of the Uni-
versity can well take pride in the
part their institution has played
in perpetuating the memory of
America’s greatest composer of
heart songs.

men, we shouted to high heaven
about the inefficiency and lack of
knowledge of those filling govern-
ment positious here. But we did
little about it.

Numerous opportunities for cap-
able men are to be found in gov-
ernment work. Approximately
800,000 persons today are in the
employ of the federal government
under permanent agencies. Thou-
sands of others serve in temporary
jobs, made available especially
under newly created emergency
departments. .1

THREE SCHOOLS OFFER

In recognition of this profession
of government service, open as it
should be to those best qualified
through deﬁnite education, the
University has inaugurated a spe-
cial course in government service.
Only three other colleges in the
country provide it today, and of
these Syracuse’s was initiated only
last week.

Headed by Dr. James C. Char-
lesworth, professor of political
science at the University, the de-
partment has maintained a re-
markable scholastic record, last
year’s average approximating B
plus. Rigid requirements have been
laid down upon students wishing
to continue. For a-student to make
an average below B automatically
disqualifies him from further con-
tinuation in the course.

FIVE FIELDS LISTED

Included under the course of
government service are five spe-
cific fields, any one of which the
student may select to follow

through. One of these paves the
way for participation in labor or-
ganization. This course, known as
labor relations, likewise takes into
account the departments which
government is establishing to deal
with labor and capital. The need
of trained men in this field be-
comes more apparent daily. For-

eign service, international affairs,
municipal affairs, public relations
are included in the government
service course.
Though only novel in education,
the State Department is yearly
giving recognition to graduates of
foreign service, by holding
special examinations, the higher
ranking participants being given
diplomatic and consular positions.

"we realize,” Dr. Charleswortti
said, “that graduates of this course
are not certain to obtain govern-
ment jobs, but we feel that their
chances will be very much en-
hanced.

Seventy-ﬁve students are now
enrolled in the course, including
26 freshmen.

“It’s in the blood. I’m from a
long line of singers,” says Sher-
man “Crooner” Pasekoif, C38. His
cousin, Phil Julius, was the ﬁrst
crooner over KDKA and his uncle
sang for the Czar, touring Europe
as an operatic singer.

Sherman sang on one of Wil-
kin’s amateur hours, and is now
in line for the $500 ﬁrst prize.
When asked if he thought he
was any good, he answered, “If
I win the $500, I’ll consider my-
self good. Until then—wel1.”

Aside from singing, “Crooner”
likes Tarzan of the Apes, because,
“It’s the only serious funny in the
comics.” As for columnists, he
reads Bob Saffron, and Westbrook
Pegler.

Sherman thinks he can win
that $500 if 5,000 students from
Pitt back him. How about it,

LINE STURDY

There is a well-founded belief,
could

however, that the Lions
have just as easily come unde-
feated into the Pitt game and that
they are a better team than the
two that downed them.

One of the features of the Lion
play has been the stalwartness of
the line. Not one touchdown has
been scored through the Penn
State forward wall. Maryland
was held to sixteen downs within
the Penn State 5-yard line at va-
rious times last week.

That line features Alex Baran-
tovich, one of the best ends in the
nation, and Johnny Economos, a
really good guard. Tackles are
Danny DeMarino and Dean Han-
ley, both husky 200-pounders.
Enders will be at the center post
and Peel at guard in the starting
line-up tomorrow.

LIGHT BACKS

Most colorful feature of the
Lion team is the backﬁeld. Windy
Wear and Hairbreadth Harry Har-
rison, two tiny boys weighing un-
der 160 pounds, are the Lion of-
fense. -

Dick Skemp, a 200-pound full-
back who runs the 100—yard dash
in 10 seconds, has started the last
two games and is expected to do
the same in tomorrow’s contest.
Either Lloyd Ickes or Co-Captain
Sammy Donato will round out the
backﬁeld combination. ‘

Grover Washabaugh, Jr., a for-
mer Mount Lebanon star and son
of the present Westminster coach,
will team with Barantovich at the
other end, completing the probable
Lion starting line-up.

SCHMIDT STARTER

Starting for Pitt in this 37th
meeting with Penn State will be
the same eleven men who have
deﬁnitely become Pitt's regular
team. There is one exception. Ted
Schmidt may replace Delich at
tackle. The line-up is Souchak
and Daddio, ends; Matisi, tack-
le; Lezouski and Petro, guards;
Hensley, Center; Michelosen,
quarterback; Goldberg and Steb-
bins, halfbacks; and Patrick, full-
back.

 

Cheering Block

Will Perform
At State Game

Although scheduled plans called
for the student cheering section to
complete its season routines dur-
ing the Nebraska game, favorable
comments from stadium observers

have made the chairman of the A
block decide to put the student.

section through maneuvers during.
the Penn State game tomorrow.

“From statements we have re-
ceived, we judge that the block
made a good showing last Satur-
day,” stated D. C. Schultz, BA38,
and William McKenna, BA38,
chairmen of the section. “In fact,
the only thing which did not turn
out so well was the Panther’s eye,
which looked somewhat blurred
because a few students got their
directions mixed.”

STATE FORMED

Featured stunts of the block,
composed of 900 students, will be
the formation of the state of Penn-
slvania with a large white “S”
set in the center; the Cathedral,
and an “S” that is “guaranteed to
do things.”

Students wishing to sit in the‘

block must be in their seats by
1:25 o’clock, when pre-game re-
hearsal of the stunts will be held.
Equipment will be passed out at
this time. Instructions for the va-
rious formations will be given by
the cheer leaders through the loud
spaker system on the ﬁeld.

An award will be given to the
section leader who has produced
the best results with his squad
during the year.

Intramural
Ring Tourney

Is Announced

After four successful freshman
boxing tournaments, the ring de-
partment announces its ﬁfth an-
nual intra-mural classic.

On the ﬁrst Monday in Decem-
ber, the freshman leather-pushers
will pit their abilities against
each other for possible future
berths on the varsity. Winners of
this tournament will form the
nucleus of the freshman team.
Besides a chance for the varsity,
the winners and runners-up will
win gold and silver chain pieces.

All those interested and not
having won numerals or a varsity
letter are eligible. Jack Shricker
sends a special invitation to the
various fraternities.

LAST YEAR’S WINNERS

The different weight divisions
begin at 115 pounds. They run at
10-pound intervals up to 179
pounds. Above 179 pounds comes
the heavyweight class.

Winners of last year’s tourna-
ment were: 115-pound class, Du-
rand; 125-pound class, Living-
ston; 135-pound class, Wargo; 145-
pound class, Curzi; 155-pound
class, McAdams; 165-pound class,
Ventresca; 176-pound class, Siko-
ra; and heavyweight, Corace.

From the above mentioned, Du-
rand, Livingston, Wargo, Curzi,
and Ventresca will probably rep-
resent the varsity this season.

If you intend to enter, report
to the stadium for practice. There
will be little time left because of
the Thanksgiving holiday.

Placing in this tournament will
go towards earning numerals.

There will be a ten-cent fee for
all entrants. This will go towards

nother pass and returned it to the
lfour-yard line. Again, Phi Delt had

prizes for the winners.

By KAL

Tomorrow’s Panther-Lion con-
test will mark the final home ap-
pearance of eighteen senior grid-
ders—ten of them regular per-
formers.

The boys who bow out within
forty-eight hours are; Frank Pat-
Irick and Bill Stapulis, fullbacks;

{Frank Souchak, Walter Miller, Ed
Spotovich, and Joe Morrow, ends;
Tony Matisi, George Delich, Ted
Schmidt, and Jim Scarfpin, tack-
;les; Don Hensley and Henry
Adams, centers; Johnny Michel-
osen, quarterback; Johnny Urban,
halfback; Dante Dalle-Tezze,
George Yocos, Al Walton, and
Luther Richards, guards.

FIVE TALK

Of this imposing group of foot-
ballers, the Panther eleven has
already had nominated for All-
American consideration, three
men-——Souchak, Matisi, and Mich-
elosen. Members of the varsity
who will return for another grid
campaign, and are seriously being
considered for the All-American,
are, Goldberg, Stebbins, Daddio,
and Lezouski.

Seniors Say ‘Goodbye’

ior

What is foremost in the minds

for the Phi Delts, again made his
presence felt in a great big way as
he calmly drew back his arm and
flipped a perfect pass over the
line, in the 4th quarter, from
Sigma Chi’s 25 yard line to Bob
Black. This touchdown meant vic-
tory for his house.

Plenty‘ of interceptions and a
couple of bad kicks had Phi Delt
in the hole many times. Early in
the second quarter a poor pass
from center prevented Cashdollar
from getting off a good kick, and

the ball traveled only five yards ,

to rest on the Phi Delt’s 15.
DEFENSE STRONG

Phi Delt held, and took the ball I

on downs, but played the biggest

part of the half in their own back- H

yard.

Late in the fourth quarter, after
Phi Delt had secured their six
points, Sigma Chi intercepted an-

to call upon their line defense to
hold in a tight spot for the second
time. They ﬁnally took the ball on
downs and punted out of danger.

The more exciting game of the
two, a whiz bang affair between
Phi Ep and PiKA, saw the Phi
Eps score in the closing minutes
of the first half and PiKA come
back in the third quarter to put
themselves very much in the ball
game.

LIGHT SHINES

Phi Ep, with Hirsch tossing pass-

PiKA on its collective heel and
finally cross the goal, Marks to
Kotler.

With Hirsch again tossing the
ball, this time to Marks, for the
extra point, Phi Ep put the game

the winning point.

PiKA wasn’t through for the

day, however, and went to work P

and got itself a touchdown,
when Ray “Shining” Light inter-
cepted a Phi Ep pass and ran it
back for a score midway in the
third quarter. The try for con-
version was no good and the score
stood 7-6 Phi Ep.

To ‘Make The Grade’

Students Worried’

About Parents’

Possible Reaction

By DAN SIMON
Members of the f'resIiiiieii
class interviewed by The Pitt

News seemed to be neither op-

tiiiiistic nor pessiiiiistic about

the eight-weeks’ grades their
pareiits will receive tonight.
Most of the freshmen are ex-

pecting about average grades. A

few opinions are:

Jeiry Hahn, C—“'All grades ex-
cept English are pretty
standards for themes are too
high; give the freshmen a
break.”

Helen Smith, BA..—-“Grades are
pretty good and the instructors
are swell, they give everybody
a break.”

Florence Ratowsky, C—“Will do
better next time. The instruc-
tors expect too much from
freshmen.”

ReVera Perlman, C———“It’s time to
start studying.”

Dave Packler, C — “Mine are
mediocre grades. Will do bet-
ter at semester’s end. Instructors
treat me swell.”

Bill Frick, BA——“My marks are
not what they should be; can-
not get down to studying be-
cause I didn’t do such a thing
in high school; it’s a great
shock.”

James Berry, BA~—-“I’ll try to
make them better next time,
but if I could only get that high
school girl friend off my mind.”

Jack Benz, BA——“My marks are
good, it just comes from listen-
ing in the class room because I
never study.”

Dot Ann Carrier, C—“They’re not
bad at all. One date a Week
will get me a couple of A’s.”

Band Marches

Tomorrow

Making their ﬁnal appearance
of the year, members of the Uni-
versity Band will present several
new marching formations at the
Penn State game tomorrow.

The regular marching band of
120 will be increased to 140 men.
The formations, while not includ-
ing the Big Apple, should be ex-
tremely interesting to the supec-
tators, announces E. J. St. Peter,
E38. publicity manager for the
Band.

For the followers from Penn
State the Band will form a large
Keystone insignia, as well as a
gigantic “P. S.” The last forma-
tion between halves will be a

' Panther’s head for the local fans.

This formation, the ﬁnale of the
Band for the year, is the most
difficult one attempted this year.

. F rench, German,

Italian Etchings

By AUSTIN HAY

Old Master prints from the fif-
teenth century Florentines to the
seventeenth century Rembrandts
now on exhibition in the Cathe-
dral fine arts gallery are attract-
ing interest not only among reg-
ular students but students from
professional schools and outsiders.

These rare French, German and
of different
mediums: etching, wood cut, en-
gravings, and dry-point. The col-
lection, valued at $30,000, is loan-
ed by the Baltimore Museum of
Arts.

A well—p-reserved group of prints
are those of Albrecht Durer, a
great German engraver of the late
fifteenth century. His “Night,
Death, and the Devil” is symbolic
of the struggle through life, the
Devil on one side of a night rider
and Death crouched on the other.
Light effects and silvery tones are
especially outstanding in Durer’s
“St. Jerome in His Study.”

SCHONGAUR’S ‘CHRIST’

A fine impression of “Christ as
a Gardener” appearing to Mary
Magdalene depicts the understand-
ing of Christ and strong sympathy
of the artist Schongauer. His fig-
ures stand out from distracting de-

tion with more expression. Schon—
gauer’s deftly executed “Wise and
Foolish Virgins” is humorous and
impressionistic.

This type of exhibit would cer-
tainly not be complete without the
master, Rembrandt Van Rijn. One
of his best known landscapes,
“Three Trees,” was done in the
latest period of his career.

‘WOMAN WITH ARROW’

The early portrait of Jan Sylvus
evinces Rembrandt’s great insight
into character. “Woman With an
Arrow” is a perfect example of his
ability to blend figures into the
background, a main characteristic
of his later works. Rembrandt pos-
sesses a fine line technique which
gives a pleasing delicacy to his
prints.

Two or three decades after Dur-
er’s death, a group of artists known
as Little Masters ran a middle
course of Italian and German in-
fluence, combined the best of each,
and with their style produced
works of delicacy and grace. This
group was so called because of
the little plates used in the pro-
cess of impression. A set of 12
prints called “Hercules” embodies
this unique style.

Mrs. Breeskin, curator of the
Baltimore museum, will speak on
these prints November 28 at 8:15
p. m. in the seventh ﬂoor library.
The public is cordially invited to
attend.

Freshman Student Works Nights

As Radio Operator ForPo1ice

Stetter Travels
On Lakes Ships

For Experience

By E. SEYMOUR KERBER

“ {ailing all cars! Calling all
cars!” booms over the loudspeak-
er, but little do the casual listeners
know, or think, that William John
Henry Frederick Stetter, BA41, is
the announcer.

Bill will not answer to the name
“flatfoot.” He denies even that
he is a cop, policeman, or officer.
He is, simply, “night operator of
WPDU.”

Six nights a week, from mid-
night to 8 o’clock in the morning,
he is on duty at the police radio
station in Mt. Washington. Five
mornings of the six he makes an
8:30 class.

Stetter was graduated from Cen-
tral high school at 17. For five
years he has worked as a radio
operator, most of the time with
RCA on ships.

STETTER TRAVELS
Licensed ﬁrst as an amateur, Stet-
ter quickly gave up his “ham”
call WBKVG in favor of the com-
mercial call WCEW on the Great

Lakes steamer S.S. Sinaloa.

Ten months a year the boats ply
from Tonawanda, N. Y., to Gary:

M
Ind. The other two months are, as

Bill says, “. . . openpfor one long
good time. You don’t have any ex-
penses while on shipboard, as you
eat and sleep there. You can save
your pay (and it’s good pay) and
spend it in the two winter
months.”

While traveling so much, a per-
son doesn’t get much opportunity
to see a great deal of the towns
visited, Bill says. A quick dash in
and a quicker dash out to catch the
boat are all the view one gets.
“Toronto,” W.J.H.F.S. did say, “is
a swell town. Don’t miss the Vic-
toria drive and Victoria park.”

After some time on the Great
Lakes, Stetter was transferred to
the Atlantic coast, where he be-
came radio operator for the S. S.
Oscar Christenson. On this boat
he traveled up and down the coast,
from Panama to Maine.

ROUTINE WORK

Refusing an offer to join the

staff of Transcontinental and
Western Airway as a weather op-
erator, Stetter came home to Pitts-
Iburgh, joined WPDU, and enter-
ed the University.
Life over at WPDU isn’t as hard
or as dramatic as it would seem.
Most of the calls broadcast are
routine. Calls are sent to break up
gstreet games and to answer acci-
dent and fire calls. Once in a long

Chemistry Meetings

To help students in Chemis-
try 9 who are experiencing dif-
ficulties or have questions to
raise, Dr. Silverman, profes-
sor and head of the chemistry
department, has set aside the
ﬁfth period Wednesdays, when
he will meet students in 302

Thaw Hall.

time something funny happens,

and once in a long time a
“thriller” occurs.
“The funniest one that I

handled,” Bill tells, “was a call
from a girl who had been engaged.
It seems that the week of the wed-
ding she and the big boy had a
fight, and the engagement was
called off. She had had many
showers, however, and had re-
ceived many gifts. So she wanted
us to send an officer over to di-
vide the spoils equally according
to the law. But no one voluntered,
for most of them have had the ex-
perience of breaking up domestic
quarrels.”
