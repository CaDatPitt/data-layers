Parties Reveal
They Will. Stay
All-Year-Round

By MURRAY CHASS

S t u d e n t political parties
will be year—round organiza-
tions starting this year.

Spokesmen for both the

‘United Independent and the

Allied Collegiate Parties stat-

ed that their parties will continue

to function after the Mar. 26 elec-

tions forhthe betterment of stu-

dent government. 5

David Breakstone, US spokes-

man, revealed late Monday
night that his party has formed
deﬁnite plans for year-round
participation, thus initiating the
new program. He said that the
party will use the names on its
petition to form the basis for
such a party.

“Our aim through an all-year
round party is to encourage as
many different ideas and opinions
on government as possible. We
feel that this is ‘the only way of
fairly representing all the Pitt stu-
dent body,” Breakstone said.

This marks the first time since
the olﬁcial recognition of political
parties in the spring of 1955 that
they have expressed a desire to
operate. in such a manner.

“From the diversity of expres-
sion we will be able to ﬁnd o-ut
what the majority wants.”

He added that the United Inde-
pendents encourage everyone who
hasn’t done so to register as a
party member. The party will
meet regularly after the elections.

Allied Collegiate. Chairman
Larry Fiedler was reached early
Tuesday morning and he, too,
said that his party favors year-
round functioning.

Said Fiedler: “I stated at the
Student Elections Committee
meeting yesterday (Monday) that
our platform is one that is going
to be followed throughout the year
and not just one of words. It is
going to be a program which our
candidates will have to endorse
and agree to follow.

“After our candidates have been
elected we plan to meet with
regularity to review our accom-
plishments and recommend any
additional matters to the candi-
dates of the party. We don't want
to be a six-week wonder.”

Concluding, he stated. “This
is an experience which is very
rewarding for students and
should be carried on the year-
round. It should be a part of
student government.”

‘named “tall” teammates.

Elgin Baylor, Seattle; Osca
Robertson, Cincinnati; Wilt Cham-
berlin, Kansas; and Guy Rogers of
Temple round out the supporting
cast of the nations “best.”

The 5-8‘/_» flash from Wam-«
pum, Pa., became the second
hoopster in Panther history to
receive All-American, honors
in his junior year although he
was named to the Little All-
American ﬁrst team last year.

Charlie Hyatt turned the trick
38 years ago by capturing Honors
in his sophomore, junior, and sen-
ior years (1928—30) at Pitt.

Don Smith and Clair Cribbs
were the other two players that
brought Skyscraper U. fame.
Smithreceived his honors in 1933
while Cribbs made the elite‘! team
in 1935.

While at Wampum High.
Hennon broke all school and
state individual scoring records
under the careful tutilege of his

Pan.ther’s Fourth

father. Butler Hennon, coach at
Wampum. Wampum’s won and
lost record those three years
was 113-3.

Because of his record-breaking
ability, the stocky Wampum flash
led the Panthers to two of their
most successful seasons in basket- ‘
ball campaigning including two
NCAA bids.

The 1956-57 season found’ the‘
Panthers winning 16 while losing
11, but this year the Locals are
sporting an 18-6 record.

With one year still remaining,
Don has set almost every Field
House record to date. His 623-
point season total breaks Ed
Pavlick’s old record of 622. In
two‘ years, Hennon has scored a
total of 1196 points to shatter
Bob Lazor’s three-year total of
1175.

To mention a few more, Don
holds the record of consecutive

‘By-Laws Committee Chairman.

Howard -Rossen, Bus. Ad. ’58, an-
nounced an open meeting sched-
uled this Friday at 2 pm. in the
Student Union Lounge to deter-
mine new’ by-laws for the recently
passed SGA constitution.

Future screening of popular
movies in the Union is currently
being investigated by the Recre-
ations Committee reported Union
Board Chairman Mary-= Alyce
Hamilton, Ed. ’58.

Other projects include a poll
among students to discover the
chief interest in the Union and
a publicity campaign to urge
greater participation in its ac-
tivities.

In answer to the question why
SU charges for certain of its pro-
grams in consideration of the $24
University fee, the Chairman ex-
plained, “The $24 we all pay is a
University fee and not entirely an
activities’ charge.”

“Moreover, that fee must pro-
vide ]or all the services of the

Union including the tremendous.

cost of maintenance and new
equipment hitherto unknown to
the Union. An outlay of $2000 for
records for the new Music and
Reading. Room is typical of our
limited finances.”

Problems Committee chair-
eman, Betty Chiappetta, Ed. ’58,
presented to SC the results of
her eommittee’s investigations.

Resulting from the problems
submitted in the Pitt Peeves box
are investigations as a special sub-
committee chaired by Gene Ven-
tura, Col. ’58, for instructor eval-
uation by students.

Leonard Parsons mentioned the
fact that he was an Independent»,
in his undegraduate days. at Pitt, ‘g’
was happy to help the party in
this way. _j

Dr. -Alan Rankin, executive ‘
assistant to the chancellor, com-
mented the same evening onbe-
ing contacted by phone: “I think
it is a ﬁne idea to stimulate’ stu-
dent interest in the primaries as.-. ,
well as student elections.” »

“He also remarked-that he had
expected such a program to be 4
sponsored by student agency more

' directly concerned‘ with the state-
wide political campaign, but is
happy to see students general in-
terest in such matters. '

Dean of Men Theodore Biddle,
stated that he strongly believed
inithe intelligent approach to poli-,
tics and approved the idea of
"bringing outstanding Americans
of both political persuasions to
the University.

A telegram was also sent to‘
Mayor David L. Lawrence by
the United Independent Party
-central c o m m i t te e member
Richard Mattern. The text fol-
lows: _f‘Congratulations on ac-
cepting (his party’s endorse-
ment). Cordial invitation to ap-
'pear as our guest at the Uni-
versity next week. '

Stassen will appear this Friday
noon. Good luck.” Thus, the
United Independents have invited
Lawrence for a guest appearance.

Richard M a t t e r n exclaimed
about the forthcoming program,
“The Independents are proud to
inaugurate a new era of political
activity for the total University
community.”

John Strauch, another member
of the party central committee,
stated: “The securing of Mr. Stas-
sen as a service to the University
is just an example of the type of .
efficiency that United Indepen-
dent candidates can exert in the

)_ ﬁeld of student affairs.”

Pat Perri remarked: “We

. want to make students more
aware of their political respon-
sibilities and we think that this "
‘kind of public meeting‘ is very
valuable."

“What really sold me," says Gerald, Maley, “was the"
way they-approach engineering at IBM. I had expected
rooms full of engineers at desks. Instead, I found all the
friendly informality of my college lab.”

An E.E., he came directly to IBM from the University
of “Buffalo, in» 1953. Starting as a. Technical Engineer,’
‘ he was immediately assigned to‘ work, with two others,
on designing a small calculator. Jerry Maley learned
a great deal about computers in a vegy short time. Inci-
dentally, this small calculaator has gone into production.
“It makes an engineer feel good,” he says, ‘-‘to see his I
project reach the production stage—and to be able to
follow it through."

Promoted to_Associate Engineer after sixteen months,‘ ~
he became the leader of a nine-man team, assigning ~
problems to his group for solution, approving their .
block diagramsfand the models they built. A short
‘while ago, heilwas again promoted-this time to '

Project Engineer. “A
particularly interesting I
aspect of my present
 job,” Jerry Maley says,

I “is the further devel-
opment of magnetic
cores——new memory,
storage devices for elec-
tronic digital compu-
ters.” His administra-
tive details have been
reduced to a minimum,
freeing him for creative I
engineering work.

Why he chose IBM

Of course, there were many reasons why Jerry Maley
selected IBM. He was vitally interested in computers,
and IBM is a leader in computer technology. He comes
from a scientiﬁefamily (his brother is a mathematician),
and is fascinated by these IBM mathematical ‘marvels
which are revolutionizing ways of doing things in so
many ﬁelds. He’ enjoys working on large equipment . . .
and on “pulses.” “It's more logica ,” he says. “In com-
puter work, you can actually see electronics at work.
And-it's not all solid math, either. What's more, this " '

weeks of classes. If the student
withdraws after the four week
period he will receive an “F.”

fPubIic Spirited Citizens

The United Independent Party has taken the initiative »

in the political race thus far, while at the _same time per-

. forminglia genuine public service for the students here.

Theinvitation of Stassen this week, and Lawrence next,
marks the beginning of a new sense of political responsi-
bility by the parties. I

It means that a political party can serve a useful pur-

pose besides the launchingof their ownvcandidates for stu- —

dent office. ~ This supports the view ‘of ,many that parties
should be and all-year-round proposition rather than the

_ static organizations they have been in the past.

Both parties have pledged, this_early in the campaign,
to initiate deﬁnite programming for the full year, periodic
meetings to plan the program, and to evaluate how com-
pletely the party platform is being carried through. ,

The United Independent Party, however, has given
graphic proof that their programming can be dynamic, im-
a ginative, A worthwhile.

The Allied Collegiates have-a potential atleast as great

as the UI’s, but the former has not before found it necessary I

to extravert themselves on any one topic. The~AC’s have
relied on a quiet electorate to bring in a small total vote,
and thus the election . , , A ‘

The action by the UI’s has the one inherent advantage
that it will impel the AC’s to strike out on their own, take
a stand, and cater to the theoretically large independent
vote. _

Whether or not this independent vote will become a
reality will depend upon the student body (as the success
of /nearly any other program depends upon this elemental
University group). A L

Druids, sophomore leadership fraternity, has taken it’

upon itself to assume as a project the mustering of a large

lRealistic Outlook? . . .

Diplomacy On The Rocks ‘I

By Millard Amdur .

George Kennan, former American diplomat and

ambassador to Moscow, has delivered a controver-

sial series of lectures in England on American for-
eign policy.

Kennan delivered the““Reith Lectures” on six

"successive Sundays over the British Broadcasting

Company. Many of the things

more so perhaps than any other
current observer of his stature.,
= Atjleast, though, Kennan ‘had
the courage of his convictions to
come out against the American-
Soviet impasse and Dulles for-
eign relations.  ” -
Kennan no longer believes in
the “Position of Strength” the-
ory of diplomacy. He claims that
inching ahead of Russia bit by
bit is not the way to negotiation of a lasting settle-
ment. ~
nAs a matter of fact, he reverses his own previ-
ous stand on this subject as he presented it in For-
eign Affairs‘ Magazine ten years ago. 4*
Point-counterpoint
He then believed in shapeless point-counter-
point Dullesian type relationship to Russian jabs.

Most unfortunately the Russia of 1947 is not the.

Russia of 1958. Although they may have been a
“vulnerable, impotent nation” at that time, Ken-
nan realizes that they are no longer so.

The new policy which Kennan espouses, at least
as dangerous as the ﬁrst, is disengagement. He is

ﬁrmly convinced that the U.S. should break contact _

with Russia‘ in the spots where frequent contact
between American and Soviet armed services might
cause a spark to- fly with violent results.

Kennan rates the chances ofggﬁnding basis for ‘

broad understanding with ‘the Russian leaders as
nil. They are men “who have systematically em-
ployed falsehood.” He, continues that their basic
values /differ too greatly from ours.

_ The sﬁrst’ place Kennan proposed disengage-
ment is Germany, where the .U.S. should be-pre-
pared to withdraw all NATO forces in return for
Russian withdrawal from the Eastern-sector. He
conceives that this could lead tolthe eventual with-
drawal of Russian troops from the whole of Eastern
Europe as we withdraw fromthe other=side.

Use Of The ‘Wooden. Rule’ . . .

 

 
   
   

He proposes a neutralized, united Germany with
a small army and the same local brush—ﬁre army
for the other Western European nations. Some ob-
servers fear that a program of this sort would
limit even to a greater extent the individual free-
dom of the peoples of Western Europe; a police
state might result. -

The western community ‘with which Kennan
seems to be left after eliminating most of the pres-
ent members is the big three English-Speaking na-
tions, U.S., Canada, and Britain.

In connection with the so-called underdevelop-
ed nations of the world, Kennan decries the sup-
posed responsibility of the U.S. to provide for
them unconditionally.

If a border-line nation should come to the U33.
and ask for aid with the argument. that the coun-
try mi ht otherwise go to the Communists, Kennan
seems to advocate letting them go their own way.

In the Middle East, he is adamant about the
necessity of our removing ourselves immediately.
H_e also claims that we should attempt to minimize
our dependence upon the oil supply in this area.

What Kennan describes makes matters even
Worse than they actually are. By putting a distance
that may be bridged in a matter of minutes by a
powerful missile between us and the Russians, we
may hardly call ourselves the stronger for having
done so. M '

Our means of communication with the Russians
seem unimproved by these measures and perhaps
worsened. Although idealistically, it might serve
the U.S. well to work on. fulﬁlling our "specific
ideals rather than competing with Russia,-it seems
likely that Russia would be highly amused arid
skeptical of this naive outlook. V. 
Reporter Contrasts -I 

"The Reporter Magazine contrasts Kenna.n’s pro-
gram with that of is Dulles and, although they may

‘be exaggerating slightly, their -point is highly eh-

lightening. ’

“Both these gentlemen,” says the Editor of the
Reporter Max Ascoli, “are ‘frightened by the
thought of the terrible devastation possible’ from
the next global war. Only their reactions arefdif-
ferent.” L " .-

Kennan proposes to give the Russiansgall they
ever askedifor in return _for u'n-summit negotia-
tions. Dulles plays about on the brink of war and
has no consistent policy.

Paddling Problems.       ’

Iy Murray Chess
On 'Jan..23 a sandy-haired, 22-year-old Cin-

V cinnati school teachers, Miss Gayle Graner, applied

the wood to the seat of a. "fourth grade student,
and one week later she herself was on the hot

I seat. A

The parents of the boy ﬁled an assault and
and battery charge against the
pretty young school marm, in
which it was _stated that she '
struck and beat the boy 15 times
with a paddle. However, the at-
torney of the parents decided to
drop the charges because, “it
was the best thing to do.”.

This Cincinnati case is not

Graner was brought into court
for paddling a student, but it is
perhaps-the only one of its kind — .

in which the teacher’s students and their parents
backed the accused one hundred per cent.

In all the cases which have arisen from such
paddlings, the teacher has been found not guilty.
It appears, then, that school teachers have a free
hand in meting out punishment to their students, as
long as it is for disciplinary purposes ' —
Crude Punishment "

Although paddling is probably the most well-
known form of handling students, teachers employ
many other, crude punishments. Some pull hair,
others like students’ ears better, and still others
enjoy cracking their pupils across the neck or back

,with their bare hands.

Physical punishment has become such a vogue
nowadays that most teachers would feel bad if they
didn’t paddle a few students each day. 

Even. though the courts have ruled that pad-

dling is permissable, there still remains the ques- ,

tion of whether teachers should be given the right

‘to use any form of punishment on students in tak-

ing disciplinary action.

First, what is the purpose of hitting a pupil?
Teachers feel.-that this is the quickest and easiest
method by which a student can be cured of his un-
ruliness in class.

They also ﬁgure that if the rest of the class
sees a fellow classmate having the wood put to
him, they will have more respect for that teacher
and willthink twice before talking out of turn or

 

  

Unfortunately, teachers do mistake this kind or
class behavior for respect. What they should realize
is‘~that this behavior is out of fear for the paddle
and not. out {of respect for them. Therefore, by

-using the paddle ;or'some other means ‘of physical

punishment teachers hurt their chances with the
students rather than bettering them .

Students thus form the same‘ opinion of their
teachers as little children do of policemen when
they are told that they better behave or else the
policemen will take them away.

The use of the paddle alsowshows poor training

- on the part of the teachers. An integral part of a

future teacher’s education is how to handle chil-
dren. Surely, there is nothing in any education
course that says a teacher should “speak softly and
carry a big stick,” and use that stick often‘ and re-
ligiously

Teachers who follow the “‘Wooden; Rule” may
argue that they paddle students out of necessity,
that these students (who are on the receiving end
of the punishment) disrupt the class to such a de-
gree that paddling is the only method by which
they will learn to be obedient. -
Methods for Obedience

But these same teachers should be smart enough
to realize that there are other ways to stop a stu-
dent’s bad behavior. These include both immediate,

.temporary methods and long-range, permanent

methods. R

A teachers has two alternatives in handling a
disobedient pupil by the ﬁrst method.

He may either keep the student after school,
or he may send him to the principal’s office. In
either case the teacher should inform the parents of
their child’s behavior‘? The only trouble with de-
taining a child after school is that the teacher has
to forego an hour or so of his time. Paddling is
much easier and much quicker.

When this is done, the parents take over as
they rightfully should. Let them _be the ones who
apply some discipline to the seat of the pants. .This
parental action is the long-range. and permanent
method. After this the young lady or g_entleman
should, or so the teacher hopes, be a we1l-behaved

‘ student. "-

This method is by no means revolutionary or
original. It is merely one that has been thrown
out and forgotten in these days of the paddle. in
handing the, responsibility to the parents,‘ teachers

Dorthea Mitche Keeps E700

Dietitian Runs Two

Large Cafeterias

By ESTHER LATTERMAN

Keeping hungry students
well fed since 1954, Mrs. Dor-
thea Mitchell, University di-
etiian, has a bigger job than
ever before. 

Since the opening of two
new cafeterias, in the Student
Union, and Health Professions
Building, Mrs. Mitchell has been
spending an average of ten hours
‘a day, in charge of the entire op-
eration which takes care of 6500
to 7000 people daily.

During her ten hour day Mrs.
Mitchell, is usually doing about
ten things at once or rushing off
in three different directions.
 Duties Vary

Her duties include checking the
Blue Tuck Shop, the Hunt Room,
Venetian Room, the two cafe-
terias, interviewing employees,
planning parties and dinners, go-
ing over all menus. and checking
all orders.

To help her Mrs. Mitchell has .
three assistants; Mrs. Brandt,
Mrs. Bander, and Miss Maire.

Mrs. Mitchell stated that her
biggest‘ worry is the lack of
steam during a meal. At one ,
time, the pressure failed, but
was restored in time to serve
lunch. The reason that this

* caused so much anxiety is that

the vegetables and coffee are
heated by steam.

“Students,” said Mrs. Mitchell,
“consume a large amount of food"
daily: 300 pounds ‘of. potatoes; 55-
60 gallons of soup; 325 gallons of
milk; 85 loaves of bread; 150-160
pies; and 40-50 cakes.” The food

-service, staff is divided into var-

ious areasyto take care of these
large amounts of food. ’
Many Problems Occur
Mrs. Mitchell also stated that
there is never a dull moment.

She needs plenty of steam.

Everything is different from day
to day with planning menus and
coping with many problems as
they arise.-

Originally from Morgantown,

' w. Va., Mrs. Mitchell attended

the University of ,West Virginia,
where she studied to be a dieti-
tian. She served her internship
at Batavia Hospital, Batavia,
.N. Y. ,

“There is no comparison be-
tween the old basement cafeteria
and the new one at Student
Union,” she stated. “The working
conditions are'm_ore cheerful and
enlightening.”

Enjoys Domestic Hobbies

In her free time, Mrs. Mitchell »

enjoys sewing, knitting, reading

and traveling. Before coming. to -.

Pitt in 1954, she was a dietitian in
an industrial cafeteria.

There are about four other Mrs.
Mitchell’s at the University with
whom she is often confused.
“Many times I. get mail and tele-
phone calls for them” she claims.

While out doing her own shop-

ping with her liusband, when he
asks what to have for dinner, she
just shakes her head, saying, “I
haven’t any ideas, you decide.’’

' SCIENCE MADE SIMPLE: NO. 2

Though this column is intended solely as a vehicle for'well-
tempered drollery, the makers of Marlboro have agreed to let
me ‘use this space from time to time for a short lesson in science.
They are the most decent and obliging of men, the makers of
Marlboro, as anyone can tell from sampling their product. Only
from bounteous hearts could come such a lot to like-—such ﬁlter,
such ﬂavor, such ﬂip-top box. The ﬁlter works; the ﬂavor pleases;
the box protects. Who can resist such a winning combination?
Surely not I.

  
         

 Ir
oz!
Today let us take up the science of medicine, which was in-
vented in 1066 by a Greek named Hippocrates. He soon gathered
around him a group of devoted disciples whom he called ’
“doctors.” The reason he called them "doctors” was that they
spent all their time sitting around the dock and shooting the

breeze. In truth, there was littl_e els\e for them to. do because
disease was not invented until 1477. ‘

‘ After that, doctors became very busy, but it must be admitted
that their knowledge of medicine was lamentably meagre. They
knew only one treatment——a change of climate. For example,
a French doctor would send all his patients to Switzerland.
A Swiss doctor, on the other hand, would send all his patients
to France. By 1789 the entire population of France was living
in Switzerland, and vice versa. This later became known as the
Black Tom Explosion.

Not until 1924 did medicine, as we know it, come into being.
In that year in the little Bavarian village of Page-Pago an
elderly physician named Winko Sigafoos discovered the hot
water bottle. He was, of course, burned as a witch, but his son
Lydia, disguised as a linotype, made his way to America where
heinvented the Mayo Brothers.

Medicine, as it is taught at your very own college, can be
divided roughly into two classiﬁcations. There is internal medi-
cine, which is the treatment of interns, 'and external medicine,
which is the treatment of externs. .

Diseases also fall into two broad categories-chronic and
acute. Chronic disease is, of course, inﬂammation of the chron,
which can be mighty painful, believe you me! Last summer my
cousin Haskell was stricken with a chron attack while he was
out picking up tinfoil, and it was pionths before the wretched
boy could straighten up. In fact, even after he was cured,
Haskell continued to walk around bent over double. This went
on for several years before Dr. Caligari, the lovable old country
practitioner who treats Haskell, discovered that Haskell had
his trousers buttoned to his vest.

Two-years ago Haskell had Addison’s disease. (Addison, curi-
ously enough, had Haskell’s.) Poor Haskell catches everything
that comes along. Lovable old Dr. Caligari once said to him,
“Son, I guess you are what they call a natural born catcher.”

“The joke is on you, Doc,” replied Haskell. “I am a third
basemen.” He thereupon fell into such a fit of giggling that the

- doctor had to put him under sedation, where he is to this day.

But I digress. We were discussing medicine. I have now told
you all.I can; the rest is up to you. Go over to your med school
and poke around. Bring popcorn and watch an operation. X—ray
each other. Contribute to the bone bank . . . And remember,
-medicine can be fun!

‘Uockey brand T-Shirts

“There were at least twenty of us unknown freshmen at basket-
ball practice that day. Suddenly, the coach was pointing at me. ’
‘Hey you!’ he called. ‘You in the good looking T-shirt, get in
there and show me what you can do!’ That’s how Jockey
T-shirts opened my door to stardom.

“I’m sure that Jockey T-shirts are the big reason I’m such a
big star today. The twin-stitch collar that lies flat and smooth,
the body of the shirt that fits just right-—not too tight or loose
-—thcsc are the reasons I’m such a comfortable star.”

Jockey T—shlrts are tailored
extra long to stay tucked
in. Free, comfortable arm

movement guaranteed.

NEAT FEAT? No! Slick Trick? A thousand times no!
When a magician makes a pack of Luckies vanish, it's
a plain case of Tragic Magic! Connoisseurs claim there’s
one approved way to make Luckies disappear. That's to
smoke (Yum!) every last one of ’em! -That way, you
get the wonderful taste of Luckies’ ﬁne tobacco . . ;
light, good-tasting tobacco that’s toasted to taste even
better. So, Ladeez-ann-Gennlemen, observe a‘ pack of
Luckies closely. Then carefully remove one (1) cigarette
and light up. Presto! You’re puffing on the best-tasting

cigarette you ever smoked!
