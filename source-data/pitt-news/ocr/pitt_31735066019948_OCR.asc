Pitt
awaits
funding

 approval

By Marc Duchin

Editor in Chief

Pitt administration is presently
waiting approval from Govenor
Casey on a Senate version of a
bill, recently passed by the
House, which will provide Pitt
with a 6 percent increase of over-
all state funding for the 1989 fis-
cal year.

Last Thursday, Pitt's Board of
Trustees adopted a contingent fis-
cal year 1989 operating budget of
$586.7 million, an increase of
$56.4 million over FY 88's
$503.3 million budget.

Dukakis names Lloyd Bentsen as running mate

BOSTON, Mass. (AP) — Michael
Dukakis today introduced Sen.
Lloyd Bentsen as his Democratic
running mate, duplicating a
Massachusetts-Texas ticket that
won the White House for John
Kennedy in 1960.

”We’re going to fight for every
state in the Union and we’re go-
ing all out to win,” said Bentsen.

At an announcement rally in
historic Faneuil Hall in Boston,
the Massachusetts governor cited
the parallels to 1960 and Bent-
sen’s strengths.

”Lloyd Bentsen brings to this
ticket, and to this nation, years of
experience and a deep committ-
ment to civil rights and equality
of opportunity that goes way back
to the 1940s,” Dukakis said.

”The Republicans in 1988 are
about to do what they did in
1960, when they nominated an
incumbent vice president," the
Democratic presidential
nominee-in—waiting said. ”Jack
Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson
beat that incumbent vice presi-
dent in 1960 and Michael
Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen are
going to beat them in 1988.”

Dukakischose Bentsen, 67, at
a late Monday night meeting with
top aides Paul Brountas and Su-
san Estrich, just hours after Jesse
Jackson, for the first time,

declared his hopes for the vice-
presidential nomination.

Thornburgh named
for attorney general

WASHINGTON (AP) — Former
Pennsylvania Gov. Richard L.
Thornburgh, picked by President
Reagan to head the troubled
Justice Department, pledged
Tuesday to ”follow the evidence
wherever it may lead” in the mat-
ter of outgoing Attorney General
Edwin Meese Ill.

Thornburgh declined to answer
questions about Meese in any de-
tail, however, in an appearance
in the White House briefing room
with Reagan, who announced the
nomination and urged swift con-
firmation by the Senate. The ad-
ministration will be in office for
only six more months.

White House spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater said Thorn-
burgh’s nomination will be sent
to the Senate during the week of
July 25, when Congress will be
back from a week—long recess that
begins Friday so that members
can attend the Democratic Na-
tional Convention.

would ”begin right away” and
added that they can ”if the
Democrats don't delay the
matter.”

Sen. Edward M. Kennedy of
Massachusetts, the No. 2
Democrat on the committee,
which will review Thornburgh’s
nomination, said he expected a
rapid confirmation.

‘'1 have the greatest respect for
Dick Thornburgh,” Kennedy
said. ”The state of justice in
America would be very different
today if Dick Thornburgh had
been attorney general for the past
three years instead of Ed Meese.”

Thornburgh, 55, had been
mentioned as a possible running
mate for Vice President George
Bush, the likely Republican
presidential nominee. And since
Thornburgh's name surfaced on
Monday as Reagan's probable
choice for the attorney general’s
job, there was talk that the form-
er Pennsylvania governor would
be kept in the Justice post during
a Bush administration. 2

Fitzwater said Vice President
George Bush was consulted
about the nomination.

The-executives had no immedi-

Heat wave, water woes affects lives nationwide

By Scot Ross

News Editor

For the residents of Pittsburgh
and its surrounding areas, the re-
cent drought has not been ac-
companied by the extensive
property and livestock damage
witnessed by citizens of the south
and midwest. The high tempera-
tures and scorching humidity
have, however, made a definite
impact on both the financial and
private sectors of our area.

Media Relations Coordinator
Ken Scherer of Duquesne Light
reported that on Friday, July 8 at
4 p.m., the company generated
its highest kilowatt output of the
year. Also, John Watson of West
Penn Power stated that they had
been pumping out in excess of
98.3 million gallons of water per
day.

The Emergency Room of
Presbyterian-University Hospital
said that while the amount of heat
and sun stroke cases haven't real-
ly increased, the number of asth-
matic patients complaining of
respiratory trouble has jumped.

Bob Herdlick, who sells flow-
ers on Forbes Avenue, said that
while business has not suffered,
he must continually ”keep the
flowers in ice or the sun will real-
ly get to them by the end of the
day.” An asthmatic himself,
Herdlick added that the heat has
caused an increase in the amount
of medication he must take and
the number of times he uses his
aspirator.

In addition, Hemmingway’s
bartender Mike Hendricks said,
’’It hasn’t been too well. I thought
the heat would bring business in,
but I guess people when they're
thirsty don't want alcoholic
beverages.”

The drought has not hurt all of
the shops in Oakland, though.
TCBY noted a 10 to 15 percent
increase in business, as did Dave
and Andy's Ice Cream Shop,
which estimated a 20 percent rise
in customers.

Total enrollment at Pitt is ex-

The proposed budget also pro-
vides for faculty and staff com-

$700,000 for development, com-
puting and telecommunications
and $2.5 million for debt service
for the Campus of the Future
project and facilities construction.

”We provided a modest in-
crease for faculty and staff; infla-
tion was running a 4 percent

”In this budget, we have at-
tempted to utilize all of our
resources —- financial and other-
wise —— to build on our strengths,
promote economic development
and increase our stature as Ameri-
ca's premier research institu-
tions," said Pitt President Wesley
Posvar. "It reflects internal re-
allocations of over $2 million and
a major effort to control costs
while sustaining the quality of the
university's academic programs.”

Police strengthen security

By Blake DePastino

For The Pitt News

Last Saturday night, after the
concert by rap group Salt ’N’ Pep-
pa at the Civic Arena, the streets
of Oakland were so crowded
with concert-goers that the Pitts-
burgh Police Department cor—
doned off Bouquet Street and part
of Forbes Avenue to redirect out-
bound traffic.

Although no assaults or
property damage resulted from
the crowds of pedestrians, sever-
al arrests were made for disord-
erly conduct and public
intoxication. Incidents like those
of Saturday night present
problems of ”people main-
tenance,” what campus security
assistant director Walter Waters
says is the most frequent security
problem of the university area.

The large number of people on
Oakland streets, particularly on
the weekends, Waters says, is not
caused by Pitt students but rather
by young people from the

SUSPECT .
INVESTIGATOR .

suburbs who spend their even-
ings in the city. ”Apparently there
isn't any other place,” he said,
"and it seems everybody comes
to Forbes in Oakland."

Great numbers of people spill-
ing into Oakland from concerts
and athletic events concern cam-
pus security not only because of
street traffic obstruction and
pedestrian accidents, but also be-
cause of the fights and assaults
that are common in nighttime
street crowds.

But the number of confronta-
tions and arrests in the Pitt area
have decreased considerably
over the past months, Assistant
Director Waters states, due
primarily to the step—up of city
and campus officers in Oakland.

Impact Detail, a five—person
team sent out to walk beats be-
tween Bouquet and Atwood
Streets, was founded by campus
security two years ago and was
extended at the first of this year

DEBRA WINGER

to cover the Forbes dormitories.
Accompanying the Impact Detail
on the streets is a squad of five
officers from the city police.

This crackdown on street
crowding and crime, demonstrat-
ed by the many officers visible on
Oakland street corners, is part of
a decade—long cycle of Oakland
crime, according to the assistant
director.

"When I first came here [19
years ago]/’ Waters explained,
”we had a street problem, simi-
lar to what we're having now 
and then burglaries in buildings
seemed to be our priority. It
seems everything just goes
around. Now we're right back to
where we were before.”

But campus security still ac-
knowledges problems with vio-
lent crime and robbery that
persist today. ”There will still be
some assaults out there,” he ad-
mitted, ”since you can't be every-
where at once.”

”On June 6, it was determined

center was the Heritage Health

Thornburgh would
be a good choice

In what appears to be a largely acceptable move, the Rea-
gan administration has tentatively announced that former Penn-
sylvania Governor Richard Thornburgh will be the successor
to Edwin Meese III as head of the Justice Department.

Thornburgh, who previously turned down offers from Rea-
gan to be director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and
the U.S. Agency for International Development, has said that
if called on, he will serve. A meeting has been scheduled be-
tween Thornburgh and Reagan for today, and the formal an-
nouncement is expected at that time.

Although there are only six months remaining in the Reagan

presidency, the choice for Meese’s successor could be influen-
tial in the Republican party's chances to remain in the White
House. With Meese’s resignation diffusing most ofthe ”sleaze
factor” accusations made by Democrats, a controversial appoint-
ment could now keep Meese’s name in the headlines, hurting
George Bush's chances at the polls.
‘ During his career as a governor, a U.S. attorney for Western
Pennsylvania, head of the Justice Department's criminal divi-
sion and now as director of Harvard University's Institute of
Politics in the Kennedy School of Government, Thornburgh has
established a nearly spotless reputation for attention to detail
and professional ethics.

Hopefully, should Thornburgh be appointed, he will bring
a much—needed dose of even—handedness to the Justice

Department.

Lovely Rita, meter

Only an idiot would continue
to park at an Oakland meter
where he had received recurring
tickets for not depositing money
at the appropriate time. For-
tunately for the Pittsburgh Police,
we are part of that seemingly
Iong— lost, restless breed.

We won’t get into exact
amounts here, but it is safe to as-
sume that between the two of us,
we have financed the 1988-89
Police Christmas Ball, provided
snacks and beverages for the
1989 Superbowl party, and paid
for a trip to Jamaica for any given
department head and his family.

If nothing else, we've paid for
enough road signs to properly di-
agram the way to get from North
to South Park.

By now, you readers are say-
ing, ”What idiots!” We've al-
ready covered that area. But let
us determine who the idiot actu-
ally is: us, for attempting to get a
free lunch? Or the vicious, car-
booting meter maids for finding
a lame job? We think the choice
is obvious.

Meter maids are a different
breed themselves. By night, they
take on the appearance of the
wife-next-door, the best mother
in the world and possibly any

other feminine cliche one can

think of.

But by dawn, the transforma-
tion has transpired. Smiles have
been erased from their faces. Mir-
rored sunglasses hide the glaring,
expired—meter—seeking eyes. Their
hands are filled with pen and pad
rather than a cooking pot or a
Tidy Bowl dispenser, or even a
soiled Pampers. And like Clark
Kent, they are wherever they are
needed, protecting the world
from the most dangerous criminal
the planet knows: the parking
violator.

Never mind the fact that there
are robberies, murders and rapes
every day. Let's just make sure
Johnny's '68 pea green Dodge
Dart doesn't score an extra 15
minutes in front of Clapp Hall.

And what of this atrocious,
godforsaken parking violator? He
is damned to wear the apricot-

justice. Just because he doesn't
have the time or the quarters to
leave class or work every hour or
two to satiate the voracious appe-
tite of the modern day Anglo-

How does one work himself
down the food chain to the sta-
tus of meter maid? Is the afore-
mentioned a rent—a—cop who
went back to school to learn the
ancient rites of meterin’? One can
dream, we suppose.

But as mere god-fearing
citizens, reared by the teachings
ofJefferson’s life, liberty and the

pursuit of happy hour in the most
Iiveable city in the country, what
can we do to rise against the
aristocracy that haunts our soci-
ety and chills it to its very soul?

We must fight. We must make
a stand. The next time you ven-
ture to your innocent parked car,
only to find an ”iron maiden” on
the tire, or a white calling card on

fists and scream a scream of
anger. Tear that ticket, break that

into your mug of ale, content that
you have fought the system; that
you have done right.

Hector in Paris says
the long trip is over

By Susan Washburn

Assistant Entertainment Editor

It's the end of an era for
Pittsburgh-based Hector in Paris.
The band has decided to call it
quits, markingjuly 16 as the date
of their final performance.

The reigning champion of the
In Pittsburgh Music Poll for the
past two years, Hector In Paris
was one of the forerunners of to-
day's expanding local music
scene. The band began playing at
the same time a new Pittsburgh
club was opening. That club was
Graffiti. Since their beginnings,
both the club and the band have
grown in popularity. Although
the two may not be linked, gui-
tar player Philip Harris associates
Graffiti with the roots of the band.

"| feel really at home there," he
said.

Harris attributes the breakup of
the band to diverse interests. "In
four years tastes and interests
change," he said. "My tastes
have changed and grown.”

Harris said that the band had
run its course. Hector In Paris had
done what they had set out to do
and were itching to do something

different.
Harris explained that Hector In

’ Paris tried to create an environ-

ment where people can have fun,
but he feels that now that attitude
has been passed on to other Pitts-
burgh bands.

"Music is like a river, every-
body is influenced by everyone
else,” he said. "I'd like to think
we've influenced some people in
town to start bands."

The breakup of Hector In Paris
doesn't mean that the band mem-
bers will cease to influence the
Pittsburgh music scene. Tim Pol-
lak (saxophone) and Dave Klug
(drums) are working with the
Spuds (Klug as a temporary drum-
mer until a new one can be
found) and Eric Allison (bass) and
Philip Harris (guitar) have been
working on solo sounds. Allison
has already released two cassettes
and is working on a third, and
Harris expects to release a single
in August.

Harris is looking for a more
guitar-based sound in his music.
"I want to go for a more raw
sound. I miss playing with
another guitar, I miss that twang.”

Music ofthe day, a sad
substitute for yesterday

By Mindy Boffemmyer

. Entertainment Editor

What's all the rage on the mu-
sical scene? I'm quite sure. that I
couldn't tell you.

I guess I haven't quite dragged
myself through time into the 80s.
-No, I seem to be living in a de-
cade that I wasn't born in time to
expenence.

.What's happening in music
these days? As I understand it,
Michael Jackson recently came to
Pittsburgh and people bought
tickets. Unbelievable.

Maybe I was still in the womb
during the Summer of Love, but
I can still appreciate good music
when I hear it. The problem is
that I haven't heard anything
worth appreciating in a very long
time.

The fad, as I understand it, is to
grab a teenager out of high-
school, tear her clothes in the ap-
propriate places, and plaster her
adorable face on an album cover.
Just ask Debbie Gibson, or Tiffa-
ny; you'll make millions.

Music is art. It's self—expression.
But today's music doesn't convey
anything to me. The goal of a
record producer has increasing-
ly little to do with art. The idea
is to sell an image.

Can Prince's guitar playing
compare to that ofJimi Hendrix?
How does "Love In Outer Space”
stack up against ”Whiter Shade of
Pale?" Call me crazy, but I just
can't see any comparisons.

I can imagine trying to explain
to my children that, once upon a
time, people used to put thought
into their music. Their songs gave
you something more to think
about than what the video would

be like. Music promoted love and
peace, not material greed. I

Also, a long, long time ago,
people could go to a concert
without creating a riot in the
street afterward.

As Entertainment Editor, I feel
that I probably should be able to
at least recognize the groups run
on the WPTS Top Ten list. But I
can't. Apparently these are the
songs that Pitt students_|isten to,
but I've never heard any of them.
I prefer Janis Joplin, Crosby, Stills
and Nash, the Rolling Stones, the
Beatles.

People term the songs that I
like "closet classics.” The music
I listen to isn't in vogue. The thing
that I can't understand is why
music is expected to go in and
out of style. What difference does
it make ifa song was released 20
years ago or 20 minutes ago? If
it's good, it's good. Beethoven
was significantly before my time,
too, but I recognize him as a
genius. Of course, that isn't too

‘ "cool" either, I suppose.

Maybe part of the reason I can't
keep track of Casey Kasem's hits
is that they're so frequently here
today, then gone tomorrow.
These groups are so fly—by-night,
that you need a score card to
figure out which stars are rising
and which are falling. I can un-
derstand that. I only have to hear
a new song once to grow tired of
it.

Music just isn't the same any-
more. The intelligent lyrics are
gone. There isn't any soul in the
music itself. These performers ar-
en't telling us anything. .

Yes, it's the end of music as we
know it, but as long as mygBea—
tles albums hold out, I'll feel fine.

Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat is running through July 23 at the Ap-

Roger Rabbit a thumping success

By John Berger

For the Pitt News

When I was growing up, I al-
ways loved it when my favorite
characters got to team up. Bat-
man and Superman, Bugs Bunny
and Daffy Duck, I was a sucker
for cross-overs. It took me a long
time to come to terms with the
cold realities of business and
copyright law; there was simply
no possibility of seeing Mickey
Mouse and Bugs Bunny in the
same cartoon.

Or so I thought. It took a long
time to happen, but it finally did,
and it is one of the reasons that
Who Framed. Roger Rabbit is
such an enjoyable film to watch.

The time is the '40s, and the
scene is Toontown, the strange
place where the stars of every-
one’s favorite cartoons live and
work. Dumbo, Droopy, the danc-
ing brooms from Fantasia and the
title character, Roger Rabbit.

Roger is a typical '40s cartoon
star —— he's clever, cute and ob-
noxious as hell. The film opens
with Roger in one of his very own
cartoons, along with his co—star
Baby Herman, who is actually a
cigar-smoking, dirty old man. He
finds himself framed for the
murder of Marvin Acme (yes, the

man who produces the Acme
Rocket Skates, Acme Instant
Holes, Acme Super Pogo Sticks,
etc.), and it soon becomes clear
that this frame job is only a small
part of a plot that threatens to des-
troy Toontown.

Roger can't get out of this on
his own, and so he turns to Ed-
die Valiant (played by Bob
Hoskins), a private detective with
personal reasons to avoid getting
involved with Toons. But he finds
that he can't turn this case down,
and so he gets swept up into the
maddening world of the cartoon
industry.

Christopher Lloyd, whom you
may know as Jim from Taxi, plays
the corrupt lawman Judge Doom.

"Doom is determined to catch

Roger, and to submerge him in a
barrel of evil-looking liquid —— the
only known substance that can
kill a Toon.

-The film is an incredible fanta-
sy that flawlessly combines ani-
mated characters with live ones,
both by putting Toons into the
real world and by putting real
people into Toontown. There
have been many attempts to
coordinate animation with live-
action film (Pete's Dragon, for in-
stance), but it has never been
done with such realism. When

someone holds a cartoon object,
the object fits perfectly in his
hand, there is no annoying over-
lap, and there is very little evi-
dence of the black outline that
often mars this sort of effect. It is
easy to believe that Eddie Valiant
is really pulling on Roger Rabbit's
ears. ‘

The story of the film carries you
along with it; there are no un-
necessary scenes, no loose ends.

The performers are also
remarkable, especially Hoskins
and Lloyd. As the ‘movie
progresses, Hoskins is called on
to become more and more car-
toonish, taking pratfalls and using
various cartoon props (a memora-
ble scene has him on a pogo
stick). He executes this beautiful-
ly, aided by director Roger
Zemeckis' surreal style of filming.

So, if you want to see a great
movie, then this is a good bet.
And if you want to see an unfor-
gettable scene with Donald Duck
and Daffy Duck performing a
truly classic piano duet in a slea-
zy nightclub, this is your only
chance. It's my childhood dream
come true, and if it's yours too,
then don't miss this film.

Packers’ QB situation getting out of hand 

Police in the Bronx section of
New York City yesterday arrest-
ed Old Mother Hubbard of nurs-
ery rhyme fame and are holding
her on four counts of cruelty to
animals and one count of resist-

’ ing arrest. Hubbard, 179, appar-

ently has yet to feed the poor dog
that has stood faithfully beside
her for years upon end. Detec-
tives searched Hubbard’s house
and found several empty cup-
boards in the kitchen, apparent-
ly left intentionally unstocked in
order to dupe the unknowing
hound, Glen. But in the upstairs
quarters of the house, which the
animal is not permitted to enter,
17 well—stocked cabinets and four
refrigerators were found filled to

capacity with cases of filet mig-
non and Hostess King Dons.
Hubbard told authorities that she
knew nothing of the food booty
and that she believes it was an at-
tempt on her dogs part to frame
her. i

Also found chained in the
basement of the house were two
Tazmanian rats and a stuffed fer-
ret, all of which appeared to be
headed toward certain starvation.

day.

0 With the addition of former
Los Angeles Raiders quarterback
Marc Wilson to their roster, the
Green Bay Packers now have
seven players at that position
ready to compete for the job in
fall camp. Add together the ta-
lents of all seven, and what you
come up with is the equivalent of
a Danny Marino in the ‘ninth

0 Fans of the Oakland Athlet-

ics were successfully able to ap-
ply the infamous ballot-stuffing
techniques of the Nicaraguan
government in sending their
catcher with a .215 batting aver-
age, Terry Steinbach, to the All-
Star game. I'm kinda surprised the
Sandinistas didn't try to get their
best grenade thrower, Jose Im-
agarbonzo, voted into the posi-
tion. Could have been decent PR
or something for those rascals.

0 Pirate shortstop Raphael Bel-
liard has a staggering eight RBI,
or exactly twice as many as Buc-
co pitcher Bob Walk.

whom would you rather have
playing shortstop for the Pirates,

missing from that combination is
Rambo, the bodyguard, and Mor-

The ratings are based on .a scale
of one to 10, but only Stepnoski
and UCLA quarterback Troy Aik-

The only defensive player to
rank higher than Stepnoski was

Stepnoski has received similar
recognition from nearly every

The Sporting News also lists

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, July T3, T988

By Ben Walker

AP Baseball Writer

CINCINNATI -— After the

' best players finish their All-Star

fun, it's time for the best teams
to take over.

”We feel like this All—Star
break is well needed for the
club right now,” New York

. Mets pitcher David Cone said.
”Maybe it will cool down a
couple of clubs and give us a
chance to recharge our batter-
ies and get going again.”

The Mets, picked to be one
of baseball's top teams this
season, have seen their Na-
tional League East lead cut in
half by Pittsburgh. The Pirates
have won five in a row and
closed within 3‘/2 games while
New York has lost its last
three.

Pittsburgh starts the second
half with 11 games at Three
Rivers Stadium while the Mets
play seven straight on the
road.

If recent history holds, only
half of the teams leading at the
All—Star break will finish in first
place.

Last season, World Series
opponents Minnesota and St.
Louis each led at the halfway
mark. But Cincinnati was in
first place in the NL West,
three games ahead of eventu-
al division winner San Francis-
co, while the New York
Yankees held a five-game lead
over soon—to—be champion
Detroit.

This year, Will Clark is hop-
ing the Giants can rally again.
San Francisco won its final five
before the break and pulled
within 2‘/2 games of Los An-
geles, which lost its last three.

”It’s definitely a little disap-
pointing that the break comes
right now with us playing so
good,” Clark said. ”Anytime
you're playing good, you want
to play every day.

”We’re getting ready to
enter a streak with 14 games

All-Star Game more than just a
break in the pennant pursuit

left against the Dodgers. Any-
time you’re playing the front
runner,’ you want to play your
best ball and ' that's where
we're at right now, so it comes
at a bad time."

The Dodgers start a 16-game
road trip on Thursday, the lon-
gest journey in the majors this
season. The trip ends with four g
games in San Francisco. Los
Angeles’ 23-13 road record is
the best in baseball.

Oakland, another team
predicted to be among the
best, seemed ready to run
away in the AL West early in
the season. But Minnesota,
which fell 11‘/2 games behind,
closed quickly before a four-
game losing streak dropped
the Twins 5‘/2 back at the
break.

”This season is a marathon.
We won the marathon last
year,” said Gary Gaetti, one of
five A|l—Stars from the Twins.
