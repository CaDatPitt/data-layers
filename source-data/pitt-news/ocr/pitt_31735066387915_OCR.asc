New alcohol rules imposed on fraternities

By Jim Tezak
Asst. News Editor

Fraternities at Pitt are going to l

have to adhere to a new, stricter
alcohol policy this year, according
to Joe Cavalla, the director of
Student Activities.

“We're trying to tighten up on
underage drinking. I think this

J policy will do that,” Cavalla said.

According to Cavalla, the
university administration still has
to approve the new drinking
regulations. He declined to
comment further on the policy
until it gets approval.

However, Mike Wells, president
of Phi Delta Theta, said that a
copy of the policy was passed
out by Cavalla and Greek Adviser

Bridget Guernsey at a meeting of
all of the fraternity presidents last
Monday.

Rick Shultz, president of
Triangle fraternity, conﬁrmed that
copies of the alcohol policy were
given out at the meeting, but
declined further comment.

Wells said that his impression
at the meeting was that the policy

had been approved and was

already in effect.

According to Wells, the new
drinking rules include:

-No advertising of any kind, if
an event involves alcohol being
served;

-All females attending a party
must be on the guest list, and the
guest list must be finalized a few
hours before the party;

The Pitt News

VOLUME EIGHTY—FOUR, ISSUE FOUR

-Anyone serving alcohol
behind a bar must be 21 years old
and is not allowed to drink;

0 Everybody entering a party
must be checked for identification

' at the door and receive a hand

stamp indicating whether or not
they are 21; .

-Non-alcoholic beverages must
be served as long as alcohol is
present;

-Free food must be served;

0Each fraternity ‘ will be
scheduled for two random checks
by the Interfraternity Council and
the Office of Student Activities to
make sure that the newrules are
beingenforced.

“What this basically does is put
us within the guidelines of our
insurance policies,” Wells said.

60.

One of the main reasons for the
new drinking policy is an incident
in which three Pitt fraternities,
Delta Tau Delta, Phi Kappa Theta,
and Sigma Chi, received citations
from police last year for allowing
underage drinking at parties.
According to Wells, the executive
officers of these houses could go
to jail if their fraternities get caught
a second time.

Keith Thomas, president of
Lambda Chi Alpha, could not
attend last Monday’s meeting and
has not seen a copy of the
regulations yet, but said that he
doesn’tsee the new rules affecting
his fraternity very much.

“Lambda Chi Alpha docsn’t
allow the buying of alcohol with
chapter funds or serving alcohol

 

to people under 21. We don’t
have any open parties; everyone
must be on the guest list,” Thomas

said.

Isle added, “These kinds of rules
have been in effect here as long
as I can remember. The university
couldn’t’ possibly be any stricter
than that.”

.Wells ‘said that the initial
reaction of the brothers in his
fraternity to the new rules has
been mostly supportive.

“Right now, there’s a lot of
mixed reactions, but everyone

realizes that this is something

that must be done.”

The presidents of Delta Tau
Delta, Sigma Chi and Phi Kappa
Theta were unavailable for
comment.

Greeks skeptical of ZBT's new ‘no pledging’ policy

}By Jenifer Crook

Staff Writer

Though the brothers of Pitt’s
Zeta Beta Tau fraternity see their
new “no pledging” policy as the
beginning of a trend, members of

“ Pitt’s other fraternities are saying

those rules will never hit their
houses, since hazing isn’t even a
problem at the university.
“There have been no deaths
here at Pitt, no instances where
hazing has been a problem, at
least not while I’ve been here,”
said Michael Magri, treasurer of
Theta Chi. “[ZBT’sl making it a
problem. So I don’t think it’s a

Q necessary policy; it just weakens

a fraternity. They’re taking away
party privileges, and now
pledging. Soon, all
fraternities will have left is their
brotherhood. T

“The only way we would turn
to no pledging is if the national
chapter made us,” he added.

“I can’t see it happening at any
other Pitt fraternities,” said Ken
Bonner, president of Sigma Alpha

_Epsilon. “There really isn’t a

[hazing] problem.”

“Our anti—hazing policy has
become stronger and strQnger,”
said Kurt Stark, FIJl’s rush
chairman. “In fact, in the last 10
years, there has been no hazing
here.”

some ,

“We feel that there is still more
work frats can do to, abolish
hazing,” said Terry McLinden,
Delta Tau Delta’s president. “But
that’s through stronger pledge
programs, by getting the pledges
to understand that hazing isn’t a
part of pledging. There are a few
bad chapters around the nation,
but Pitt’s fraternities don’t have
hazing.”

Mike Wells, president of Phi
Delta Theta said that “lthe anti-
pledging policy] is not even a
consideration with our national

chapter. Hazing is of little

significance for
anymore. We’re still strongly in

ZBT has to enforce the new
policy under guidelines set by

A the group’s national chapter, as a -

result of deaths and injuries
caused by hazing around the
nation. ZBT president Michael
Neuman told The Pitt News last
week that hazing has caused 44
deaths in the past 10 years.
Although brothers of ZBT have
expressed a positive outlook as
they enter their first term without

pledging, other fraternities say’

that by taking away the pledge
period, ZBT is removing an
integral part of Greek life.

“A frat without, pledging is just
like a club,” said Wells. "1 think
you’re robbing people when you

take away their
experience. You're not going to
get as much out of your
brotherhood if it’s just handed to
you; ifyou don’t put outthe effort
of learning about the fraternity
and its brothers.”

Stark feels the same way.

, “Pledging is an educationaltime,”

he said. “The new brothers of
ZBT will be coming into the frat
without the necessary
knowledge." V
McLinden said, “Those [ZBT]
brothers aren’t really going to
feel like a part of it until after a

Even though some of the new

be medically unnecessary and

of the American Civil Liberties

them.

House Bill 1864 is “a bill with
broad-based support in
Pennsylvania from doctors,
attorneys [and] many groups,”
according to ACLU member Mark
Smith. I

The bill, introduced by
Philadelphia Representative
Babette Josephs, is called the
“Josephs Conﬁdentiality Bill,” and
“is one of the best Confidentiality
bills in the country,” said Smith.

Oakland, home of the
University of Pittsburgh, is three
miles east of the downtown area.
Known today for its educational
and medical complexes, Oakland
contains a number of architectural
attractions, many of which were
built by the city’s foremost
industrialists early in this century.

Behind the Cathedral of
Learning is Heinz Memorial
Chapel, a gift to Pitt from Henry
John Heinz. It is one of the best
modern examples of . French
Gothic architecture in the country.
At the intersection of Bigelow
and Fifth is Soldiers and Sailors
Memorial Hall. Its museum
contains one of the ﬁnest public

in the area, including an extensive
collection of Civil War relics.

After walking across the Panther
Hollow Bridge into Schenley Park,
one will find Phipps Conservatory,
the nation’s largest greenhouse,
now recognized for its spectacular
seasonal ﬂower shows. This 2- 1/
2 acre botanical garden was
commissioned by industrialist
Henry Phipps, a business partner

of Andrew Camegie’s-

railway along Forbes and Murray
Avenues enabled access to the
neighborhood. '
The area remained pastoral until
the 19205, when Murray Avenue
was paved, the Morrowfield
Apartments were constructed, and
a commercial strip developed.
Afterward, many Eastern
European Jews migrated to the
area from the Hill District,

establishing Squirrel Hill as a

center of Jewish culture in the
region.

Squirrel Hill’s scenic natural
areas were preserved through
the establishment of Frick Park
and Schenley Park. Plots of land
for these two parks were donated
by Henry Clay Frick in 1919 and
Mary Croghan Schenley in 1889.
Both parks feature nature centers

fraternity. I think pledging is very
important because it lets the
pledges see what the fraternity is

' all about.”

One big policy outcome other
fraternities are anxious to see is
how ZBT’s pledge abolishment
will affect this year’s rush. While

V everyone interviewed agreed that

ZBT’s rush numbers will probably
increase, they added that the
growth won’t hurt rush at their
individual fraternities. _
“IZBT is]. going to have the
greatest rush in history. T hey’ll
have 200 people rushing there
with the attitude, “Why pledge if
you I can just be a brother
instantly?” said Magri, who added
that his fraternity’s rush will be as
strong as ever. _ .
“If we just get 10 people we
like, who fit in with Theta Chi’s
standards, then we’re happy.”
“It won’t hurt us,” said
McLinden. “When you’re a rusliee,

. you go up to the house to see

what«it’s all about. You don’t
really look at the pledging,

because pledging doesn’t make a

fraternity. It’s
people.”

Bonner said, “It will probably
attract some more people than
usual to their fraternity, but it’s
not going to hurt us.”

“I suppose the policy will help
out with ZBT’s rush numbers;
they’ve had a lot of people show
interest,” said Stark. “But if rushees
don’t like a house, I don’t think

the group of

/they’re going to go there just

because they don’t have to pledge.
'l'hey’ll still go where they fit in
with the group and its standards.
I don’t think most of them will
take the easy way out.”

Regardless of theimpact ZBT ’s
new policy may have on its own
house or the other 8 Greek
organizations on Pitt’s campus,
one thing is certain: the eyes of
all Greeks at the University of
Pittsburgh will be focused in Zeta
Beta T au’s direction thisfall.

“I’m really interested to see
how,they’re going about it,” said
Bonner. 1

‘‘We’re just takinga ‘let’s see’

I attitude. We wish [ZBT] the best,

and hope it works for them."

 to other diseases, such as diabetes,

‘ which can be controlled for long
periods of time.
“We also need more funds for

education,” Smith said. “Coalitions

from Philadelphia and Pittsburgh
have been testifying” in the state
House and Senate for this cause.
The ACLU has given its support
to bills that include education
measures, such as HB 1390, which
creates an $18 million fund for
AIDS treatment and education.
“These are the types of bills
we’d like to see move,” Smith.
said. “There are other bad bills
out there that are medically
unnecessary.”
One bill the organization cites

«ﬁgs unnecessary is HB 1217, which

forces HIV-positive people to
inform medical and emergency
workers of their HIV status.

“There are universal
precautions which can be taken
to protect emergency workers
from AIDS and other infectious
diseases, instead of placing the
burden and the blame on the
victim, ” said Smith. Literature from
the ACLU lists the use of
protective gowns, gloves and

N masks as possible precautionary

2;

' €3.Sl.1I'€S.

The ACLU is also opposed to
bills which require prisoners with
AIDS to be separated from other
prisoners, like HB 1218.

“[This] will cost the taxpayers a
hell of a lot of money," Smith
said, “and it just reinforces the
paranoia about AIDS.”

Instead of quarantines, the
ACLU recommends more
education of the staff and inmates
to keep the problem from
becoming acute. The organization
also supportsibetter medical care
for HIV-positive inmates, even
‘those who do not yet display the
major symptoms of AIDS or AIDS-
related complexes.

Bus lane a threat to all

There has been a long and drawn out ‘debate as to the
pros and cons of the bus lane located on Fifth Avenue, but
nothing ever gets resolved. . A -

The bus lane is still there (although temporarily shut
down), and now it is new and improved. The future

 victims of the bus lane will be happy to know that they »

can be splattered on a newly resurfaced road.
Back in May, University of Pittsburgh’ President Wesley
Posvar and a group of Oakland physicians surged city

council to get rid of the bus lane altogether — but to no j

avail.
For the past fewmonths, the buses that usually traveled’
in the bus laneghave been re-routed to Forbes Avenue.

What iswrong with this arrangement? With the existence I
of two one-way streets, it would be best for public bus .

ﬂow to follow the flow of traffic on both Forbes and Fifth. ‘
How many pedestrians must be killed in the bus lane for
the public authorities in Pittsburgh to recognize the threat
posed by it? With a university and severalhospitals in the
area, a large number of people who may be unfamiliar

Q with the workings of the bus lane are wandering the

*6

streets. Why should the lives of these people be risked so
that buses have a lane all to themselves?

Every year, at least once, someone is needlessly killed
in the bus lane. Last year, a man who was in Pittsburgh
visiting his wife, who had just received ‘a transplantsin
Presbyterian-University -Hospital, stepped out into the
lane and met instant death via a bus. Imagine the effect
on his wife’s recovery when she was told what had
happened to her husband. ‘a
. This is an unnecessary evil. Oakland is not busy enough
to warrant the presence of the bus lane — especiallybwhen
the alternative is so obvious. ' '

Labor Day... all playand   no work?

, If you aren’t aware of the rea-
son everything was closed yes-
terday, don’t worry ’-— you’re
probably not alone. - -
For those who are interested,
yesterday was Labor Day — a
national holiday when America

takes off work to celebrate labor. .

A contradiction by its very terms,
this holiday is perhaps offered to

_ an undeserving society -—- myself

included. It seems as though the
stories we’ve all heard from our

, grandparents about labors that

are now replaced with a touch of
a button ring true. Work, it seems,

V is a four-letter word.

The way in which my first
observation leads to my rather
negative conclusion stems from a
very recent turn of events in the
music world. I’m referring to New
Kids on the Block—- the group of
kids who recently came close to
a sell-out at the Civic Arena and
inspired serious talk of it on a
second show. Perhaps you are
one of those people who dance

in front of the mirror every night

to the “New Kids Dance.” Or
maybe you camped out down-
town to get front-row seats for

 

the concert, in order to catch a bit
of Joey’s sweat. Why such a
cavalier attitude? It's simple; the
group I’m referring to is com-
prised of young men (if they can

be called that) who between them V

cannot Play an instrument. -Some
can barely sing, for that matter.
Instead, their producer, Mau-
rice Starr, plays all of the music.
I guess the best answer for their
success is found in a recent issue

> of . BOP magazine, which de-

scribed these guys as “super
cuties.” Does it bother devout
fans that their heroes are stars in

an industry created by people

who had actual musical ability?
The New Kids feel that working
with instruments is simply un-
necessary in today's music indus-
 Like most people, they think

that work should be placed on

the back shelf.

Ifthese are truly the “New Kids
on the Block,” I want to move to
a different neighborhood.

We live in an age where Ameri-
cans would rather watch than
read. People prefer Roseanne to
Gauguin -— she’s easier to look
at, and requires less attention. It
is an age where a $6 piece of
processed meat and some card-
board vegetables can be pur-
chased in a box labeled “Budget
Gourmet” —- a blow to those
who used to spend hours prepar-

ing food that actually tastedgood.
Once upon a time, Shakespeare \

‘was considered the world’s best
‘writer. Today, it seems to be a
man named “Cliff Notes” who
has mysteriously rewritten all or
the world’s known classics for

mass consumption. There once A
was a day when people walked. \

Today, we have a world of esca-
lators and moving sidewalks —
of elevators in two-story build-
ings I saw a man the other day
who was wearing a 'l'—shirt that
read, “Work never seemed to
hurt anybody-— why be the
first?” People who work, more
thanltheminirnum 40 hours a

week are labeled as “workahol- K

ies” and have been made into a
subject doomedto talk show hell.

Here at Pitt, we should not be
afraid to work —- especially on
things other than getting the ulti-
mate high, the easiest A, or cop-
ping the most incredible buzz.
Work can be refreshing. How
about giving it a try, America?
Until we begin to discover that
forgotten ethic, perhaps we
should stop celebrating Labor
Day. Don’t worry, though -—
people would probably still take

A the day off.

Wasting perfectly good plutonium would be a loss to society

We, as a people, sit on the it as well. I felt that the waste of

brink of nuclear Armageddon.
So, let’s get on with it.
Look, the missiles are sitting
there. Are we going to wait for

 

the plutonium to decay and
become completely useless?
Waste, waste, waste.
When I was a child, I was a

A:-)'picky lad. I refused to eat all

manner of food. I especially hated
ham. Ham, I felt, had the texture
of sheet rubber, and the taste of

a chunk of ham was no great loss
to society at large or the world in
general.

My mother did not agree. She

I said, “There are children starving

in California who would love this
ham, and you want to let it go to
waste? Wasting food is a sin.”
Letus look at the relative availa-
bility of ham as opposed to plu-
tonium. Let us look at the relative
costs. It turns out that there is
much more ham in the world
than plutonium. Also, there are

- pigs out there reproducing at an

unsettlingly high rate in order to
produce yet more ham, when
there is already, as I mentioned,
very much more ham than pluto-

nium. Thus, ham costs much less
plutonium.

Therefore, if it is a sin to waste
a slab of vulcanized ham, it is
much more of a sin to waste all of
the plutonium in all of the war-
heads in the world.

Since we have enough missiles
to destroy the world 12 times
over, I suggest we take out the
rest of the solar system as well.
Or, we could put all of the extra
missiles on the moon, program-
ming them to go off if triggered
by radio signals, so that if society
did, by some misfortune, rebuild
itself, the missiles could wipe it
out again, up to 11 more times.

At any rate, I am all for a

nuclear war. I am aware that
many of you might not agree
with me. That is quite acceptable,
since we would all be dead, and
I wouldn’t have to listen to your
whining and snivelling.

Just think of the ski slopes after
a nuclear winter...

With all of this in mind, I have
decided to run for president as
the first and founding member of
the Annilihist Party. I hope that
you are all aware that you can
vote for me even if registered as
a Republican or a Democrat. You
are not legally constrained to
vote for the party that you are
registered in, and no one can
make you vote party lines.

So remember, in the upcoming -

elections put the button in the
hands of someone who knows
how to use it. This is your land,
your world. Help rid it of the lice
and vermin who all think‘they’re
so smart now. Think about the
expressions on their faceslin the
afterlife. A good nuclear war will
wipe those smug grins off of their
faces. 7 -

UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

Van Pelt leads Pitt over Paciﬁc 38-3 in first tst

By Mike R_ampa
Asst. Sports Editor

Worrying about making a good
first impression is a concern for
just about everyone. But first-
time Pitt quarterback Alex Van
Pelt has little to worry about after
his impressive outing in the
Panthers’ 38-3 thrashing of the
Pacific Tigers this past Saturday.

Van Pelt completed 11 of 17
passes for 141 yards, throwing
one interception in the third
quarter which turned out to be of
little consequence. Ilele also ran
the ball into the end zone himself
during the second quarter to put
the Panthers up 21-0.

Pitt coach Mike Gottfried was
extremely impressed with his
young quarterback’s first outing.

“The only difference between
lPacific’sl freshman [QB I)ave
Ileniganl, who is a true freshman,
and ours, who was a redshirt, is
24 college credits. Other than
that, they’re the same.

“We were looking at possibly
having a junior out there who

had a lot ofplaying experience as

opposed to a person who was
playing [his] first game. I was very
pleased with the way Alex
played,” Gottfried said.

After Darnell Dickerson was
declared academically ineligible
this past summer, many questions
and a general feeling‘ of
uncertainty arose about the
Panther quarterback slot; In fact,
the pregame information packet
boasted only a three—sentence
description of Pitt’s quarterbacks
and their accomplishments.

With Dickerson’s supreme
athletic ability and quickness, the
Panther coaching staff was
prepared to execute, and the fans
were prepared to watch, a high-
powered offense led by
Dickerson’s ability to throw,
scramble and turn a potentially

‘disastrous play into a big gain.

But once Dickerson was out of
the picture, with the early spring

transfer of backup QB Larry
Wanke tojohn Carroll University,
the Pitt quarterback slot became
a huge question mark. Van Pelt,
who had never taken a snap in
college football, junior Scott Stark,
who had played in ‘only one
Division I—A game at Stanford,
and sophomore wall<—on Matt
Getty comprised the new
possibilities.

Since Pitt fans had great
expectations for a Dickerson—run
offense, Van Pelt believed he had
an advantage as a surprise starter;
the fans and general public did
not know what to expect from

this youngster.

“I ‘think a lot of people have
overlooked the fact that there's
all kinds oftalent on our offense,”
Van Pelt said.

“We’re a talented offensive
team,” he added, “and the loss of
Darnell is unfortunate. We’re just
going to make do with what we
have, and it’s still going to be a
powerful offense. I think the
expectations are going to be met
this year.”

One of the most noticeable
aspects concerning Van Pelt’s ﬁeld
presence is his confidence. An
offshoot of this trait is his
thoroughness and patience in
executing plays. Van Pelt, in direct
contrast to Dickerson, does not
run or scramble much on passing
plays. Instead, he simply drops

back, stays in the pocket even

under pressure, and calmly looks
for his target.

‘Van Pelt also threw the crucial
block in the second quarter on
the reverse from Curvin Richards
to Ilosea Heard which enabled
I leard to take the ball 55 yards for
Pitt’s second touchdown, one of
the most exciting plays of the
game.

“That’s a play we practiced all
through training camp and all
this week. 'lheir defense just
flowed to the flip, and when the
reverse came around, my man
wasn’t expecting me, andl caught

stay in front of the Pacific Tigers all Saturday afternoon.

him off guard,” Van Pelt said.
Despite Gottfried’s words of
approval for his freshman’s
performance, Van Pelt remained
self—critical. “Overall, it was
a mediocre performance, and I
think I could’ve done a lot better,”
Van Pelt said. “I fumbled the ball
on the sidelines,’ which is
inexcusable, and I threw a bad
interception. But overall, I think

the offense did a good job.  Our
line was great. I don’t think I got
touched all day, and if I did, I’d
like you guys to show me when.”

Considering there are a lot of
top 20 teams on the Pitt agenda
this season, Van Pelt was happy
to get a game with an unranked
team under his belt before taking
on such foes as Syracuse and
West Virginia.

This Saturday, Van Pelt will
play in his first road game
against Boston College, a team
which has beaten the Panthers
in their last three meetings.

“I think we really have to
concentrate in the next seven
days on Boston College,” Van
Pelt said, “and go up there
with the intention of playing a ’
tough ball game." ’

Kick-off yardage,

for Pacific contest

O.K. Pitt’s football team
trounced the University of Paciﬁc
Tigers on Saturday, 38-3. That
news is old. But let’s look behind

 

the scenes a little and see how
they did it.

oPitt started off the game
looking like a perfect football
team, but at the same time looking
like a team apt to make costly

mistakes.

Pitt’s Steve Israel returned
the opening kickoff 95 yards
for an apparent touchdown.
As the Panthers rejoiced, the
little yellow flag on the 20-
yard line stood out like a
l,0OO—watt light bulb.

-After the penalty, Pitt
started the first drive on its
own 9-yard line. They drove
91 yards in 16 plays for the
first touchdown of the year.
Curvin Richards capped off
the drive with a 7-yard TD
run.

Strong special teams play results in scores

By Chris Bosak
Sports Editor

Almost every sport is made up
of two basic components: offense
and defense.

In order for a team to be
successful, it must be solid in
both these aspects.

The 1930 Philadelphia Phillies
had a team batting average of
.515, quite an impressive offense.
However, their defense and
pitching were so bad that they
finished in last place.

Loyola-Marymount’s basketball
team averaged over 100 points
per game last season, but was
knocked out in the first round of
the NCAA tournament because
they didn’t know how to play
defense.

Football is no different in that
offense and defense are the main
parts of the game. However,
football has another feature that
is not quite offense and not quite
defense: special teams.

While Pitt’s offense and defense
were solid throughout Saturday’s
38-3 victory over Pacific, Pitt’s
special teams really stood out.

“I thought our special teams
really played well. I couldn’t fault
one area of our special teams,”

Gottfried. “I feel the kickers all
did a good job, the coverage was
good and the return men are
dangerous.”

  Cross-country   looks to improve

For The Pitt News

With a solid third-place showing in last year’s Big
East Championships, and a ﬁfth—place ﬁnish in the

NCAA regional ﬁnals, Pitt’s men’s cross country.
9 ‘team begins the 1989 season with high expectations.

The Panthers are fronted by junior Scott

S Humphrey, who ﬁnished seventh in last year’s Big

East Championships. Humphrey, who transferred
from the Naval Academy, was a high school track
All—State competitor for three consecutive years at
Indiana High School.

Pitt will also rely on . help from senior Paul

a Friedrich, who finished 15th in last year’s Big East

meet. Friedrich also captured the steeplechase title
during last year’s outdoor track season, and Pitt
cross country head coachjim Lear expects Friedrich
to be one of the team leaders.

Other members returning from the 1988 Panther
cross country squad include juniors Keith Dowling,
Craig Woshner andjim Hamilton, and sophomores
Jason Bodnar and Eric Downer.

Dowling placed ninth in the Big East meet last
season, achieving All—Big East status. Woshner

placed sixth at the 1987 Big East Indoor
Championship track meet in the 5,000-meter run.

Pitt opens its season Sept. 9 against Kent State,

and is working hard to prepare for the meet. Lear

said all of his runners put in at least 70 miles of
training a week »

In addition to the roadwork, most members of
the squad participate in two SK races a month and
any races that may. be taking place near their
hometowns. '

Panthers, Pacific earn
each others’ respect

The Paciﬁc Tigers were given
little respect and little hope
prior to their matchu p with Pitt
on Saturday. Nobody really
wanted to give them a chance
to prove themselves. And why
should they? Pacific was 2-9
last season, losing to teams
such as San Jose State, Fresno

State and Utah State. Pacific is S

a representative of the Big
West Conference, which can’t
even dream of being compared
to powerhouse conferences
such as the Big 10 or the PAC
10.

Even though Pitt won the
game 38-3, Pitt head coach
Mike Gottfried has the utmost
respect for the Pacific football
team and ﬁrst—year Paciﬁc hea
coach Walt Harris. 9

”I think they played very
hard, they played physical, and
they stayed right with us,” said
Gottfried. “They could have
laid down when the score was
28-0, but they fought back.”

Harris was concerned with
the lack of respect his team
was getting, but he was happy

with his players’ performance
overall.

“We came into the game
hoping to earn Pitt’s respect,
and I believe we did that,”
said Harris. “They have better
athletes than we do. We were
up against a good line and
good runners. Hitting was the
No. 1 thing we planned to do
in this game, and that’s..what
our defense did — hit.”

Harris also expressed his
respect for the Pitt football
team.

“We were up against a vastly
superior unit. I want to give
Pitt credit because they came .
after us.”

Pitt’s offensive line, which
started two newcomers and
suffered one injury, impressed ’
the Pacific players the most.

“They played very tough,
and the offensive line, I felt,
played very well,” said Pacific
linebacker Ryan Blossey. “We
came here to prove ourselves
and I ‘felt we did that to some
extent. I felt we hit very hard

'89 Soccer
team adds
to depth

By Geoff Moskowitz

Staff Writer

The Pitt soccer team is looking
to improve its 1988 record of 6-8-
1 with aistrong returning team
and a handful of good recruits in
1989.

“We have a solid returning
nucleus and good leadership,”

1 said head coach Joe Luxbacher. a
“Hopefully, we have improved‘)

over the summer.”

Two local incoming freshmen
head the recruiting class. }.R.
Perdue, a midfielder, was a
member of last year’s state
championship squad at Peters
Township High School".

Luxbacher is also anticipating a,

solid first season from Scott
Alexander, a forward from Shaler
High.

Rounding out the recruiting
class is juniorcollege transfer
Roberto Croce, a defending
midfielder whom Luxbacher
called “an experienced and ﬁne
player.”

Leading the returning players

will be senior captain Sam Lanza

Notebook

Continued from page 8
Mike Gottfried. “When you have
a kickoff return like that, all of
sudden it’s called back and a little
adversity hit us, we took a long
drive for a touchdown. That was

a very good sign for an offensive ’'

line [with] two young guys in
there.”

Gottfried was referring to
sophomore Dave Dixon and
freshman Mike LiVorio who
started ‘on the right side of the
line for Pitt.- ’

0 Another notable aspect of that
first drive is-that Pitt ate 7:37 off
the clock —- almost half of the
first quarter. Sustaining a long
drive and using up a lot of the

clock will be vitally important to
Pitt when they get into the tougher
games.

0 Everybody was waiting to see
what Alex Van Pelt would do at
quarterback. He came through
with a solid performance,
connecting on 11 of 17 passes for
141 yards. His receivers dropped
two passes but also came up with
some tough catches.

Van Pelt also threw a key block
that allowed Hosea Heard to get
around the end on a reverse play
and take it in for a 55-yard
touchdown.

Van Pelt was happy to be
starting against Pacific instead of
one of the upcoming games

Heidi R. White/The“Pitt News

Prentiss‘ Wright led the Panthers with seven tackles

against top 20 teams.

“I felt good about starting out
with Paciﬁc,” said Van Pelt. “I
think I needed a game to get my
nerves out of the way and get a
game under my belt, which I did.
We’re going to have a tough
schedule; I think I need to get a
little experience in these first

couple of games so I’ll be used to-

it by then.”

-Richards showed no signs of .

slowing down after last season.
He rushed for 112 yards on 18
carries, an average. of 6.2 yards
per run. ’

Fullback Ricky Turner had 53
yards on ll attempts. Adam
Walker rushed only four times
for 24 yards. . ’

In all, 11 Panthers ran the ball.

-Left guard Chris Goetz threw
a key block in the second quarter
on a third-and-20 situation to
allow Richardsto pick up a first
down.

-Pitt’s defense held Pacific to
just 140 total yards : Prentiss Wright
led the Panthers with seven
tackles. Marc Spindler added six,
Craig Gob and Nelson Walker

each had five.

Pitt had four sacks in the game.
Keith Hamilton, Tom Sims, Mark
Gunn and Nelson Walker each
had one. Sims and Mike Boykin
each had a fumble recovery.

Although Paciﬁc completed just
12 of 23 passes, at times it seemed
as if Pitt’s secondary was content
to let them catch the ball and
tackle them on the spot.

°Saturday marked the return
of defensive end Tony Siragusa,
who missed all of last year due to
a knee injury. He had four tackles,
one tackle for a loss and one
blocked pass.

“I’m happy with the way I
played, I just have to take it one
step at a time,” said Siragusa. “I
think this is the first time I turned
up the volume. I still have a way
to go, but I think I'm going to
progress every game. I feel good
—— nothing hurts.” . V

-After building a 28-0 halftime
lead, Pitt came out for the second
half a little slow. They didn't
score again until about halfway
through the final quarter when
Van Pelt hit Glenn Deveaux on a

13-yard TD pass.

“We became very lethargic in
the second half; we were very
sluggish,” said Gottfried. “I don't
know why. I think we’re
conditioned. We had a long camp.
It was a tough camp, and maybe
that was the sign of it in the

“second half. Next week, we

cannot afford to play that way;
we need to improve in the second
half.”

Pitt plays Boston College next

week in Boston.

-Pitt suffered a mass of minor
injuries. Cornerback/punt
returner Alonzo Hampton twisted
his ankle on his first punt return
and sat out the rest of the game as
a precautionary measure.
Offensive guard Chris Goetz had
a concussion, and center Dean
Caliguire was forced to move
back to his old position of guard.

Ronald Redmon, who was
supposed to start at fullback,

‘missed the game because of

muscle spasms in his neck.-
Turner, Richards, Walker and
Derrick Lewis were all pulled at

some point due to minor injuries.

was a good indication of what
the special teams are capable of.
Steve Israel took the opening
kickoff 95 yards for a touchdown.
A holding penalty nulliﬁed the
TD, but it showed that Pitt’s kick
return team could be dangerous.

Israel took Paciﬁc’s only other
kickoff 47 yards up the sideline
into Tiger territory.

Alonzo Hampton is considered
by many to be the best punt
returner in the country. On his

‘ first chance, he returned the punt
12 yards. He twisted his ankle on.

the play, and Henry Tuten took

over the punt return duties.

Tuten caught his punt on the
Panther 40-yard line. He broke
through the initial wave of would-
be tacklers, went toward the
sideline, put on some nifty moves,
and outran everybody else into
the end zone. He duplicated
Hampton’s feat in last year’s
season opener against Northern
Iowa, when Hampton returned a
punt 71 yards for a touchdown.

Tuten had to fair catch the
remaining Paciﬁc punts.

Tuten wasn’t\sure if he would
get the punt return duties again
next week.

GET INVOLVED

“That’s up to the coach. Alonzo
is the premier punt returner. But
if he’s hurt, I’d be willing and
able to accept the job, ” said Tuten.

Tuten added that he is just one
of many dangerous return men
Pitt has in their special teams.

“I think any time Alonzo, Steve
[Israel], or myself touch the ball,
that the opposition has something
to think about. You never know
when we're going to break one.”

Brian Greenﬁeld, Pitt’s - new
punter from Glendale Junior
College, lived up to everyone’s
lofty expectations.

Greenfield only got the
opportunity to punt twice. His
first punt sailed 45 yards, and his
second went 50 yards. His 47.5-
yard average in game one is over
10 yards more than Pitt’s punting
average in 1988.

Backup quarterback Scott Stark
also got into the punting game. In
the fourth quarter, he lined up in
the quarterback position, called
out some signals and dropped
back into punt formation. His
punt landed on the 5-yard line,
but the ball bounced into the end
zone for a 40-yard kick.

In a surprise move, Gottfried
started sophomore place kicker
Ed Frazier in front of veterans Jeff
VanHorne and Scott Kaplan.

Frazier was perfect on the day,

‘hitting five of live extra points ‘

and a 27-yard ﬁeld goal.

VanHorne did the kickoff
duties.
