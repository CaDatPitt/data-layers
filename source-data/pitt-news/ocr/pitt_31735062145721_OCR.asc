Willison Quickly Ends Meet After
Derr Opens Way For
Leaders’ Exit

 

By Charles B. Holstein

VVH11 Alpha and Beta coalition party
lines clearly cut at six ta 39-,-en, a
special meeting of Interfraternity
council, called to discuss means of
that bo(:y’s supporting the Cathedral
drive, was suddenly adjourned by
Robert Willison, BA35, Delta Tau Del-
ta. president of council, as a motion
was pending to remove the four new-
ly elected executives of the group
from office,

After more than two and a half
hours of heated debate, covering ﬁrst:
the drive question, and then develop-
ing into a fight by the Beta co~a.liti_on
of seven fraternities to oust Vvillison
and his entire administration (solid-
ly Alpha), Vvillison ended the meet-
ing by declaring it in a state’ of dis.
order and maintaining that it was
impractical to take a vote on adjourn-
ment. This action followed four pre-
vious defeats of motions for adjourn-
ment,

In one of ‘the best organized se-
quences of legislative action attempted
on this campus, the Beta coalition,
DOW a majority in_ council with seven
member fraternities, succeeded in
pushing through a series of motions
making it now possible, according to
King Derr, C35, a Beta spokesman,
legally to remove Willison, Joseph
“Rodgers, C36, Phi Kappa, Earl lsrael,
C35, Pi Lambda Phi, and Robert Bowd-

the present time. Some of the out-[
standing perforniances of swimmers
in AMA competition
will be mentioned. Jack Scarry, coach
of the world's championship women’s
swimming team, will talk on “Girls
in Competitive Swimming.” Mr. Scarryl
is the coach of Lenore Kight, who
was a member of the last Olympic
team, and holder of several world
championship records. Allen Riso-
dorph, coach of the Carnegie Tech
swimming team,» Harry Blair, repre-
sentative of the City high schools, and

been declared “irregular” by Beta,
houses.

Immediately after a concerted at-
tempt had been pledged by the-

thirteen member fraternities to secure-

the Sulmort of their alumni organi-

zations in the Cathedral drive, Derr’

took the floor
motion:

“The rules contained in Robert’s
Rules or Order Revised shall govern
the council in all cases to which they
are applicable, and in which they are
not inconsistent with the by-laws or
the Special rules of order of this coun-
cil, except that a majority of all the
member fraternities shall be com-
petent without previous notice to
take any action which is therein held
to require a two—thirds vote.”

The motion was passed, 7-6, Beta,
vs. Alpha.

The real signiﬁcance of the passage
of this motion was not fully realized
until after later developments of the
evening. The clause making it pos-
sible for a majority to obtain passage
of certain legislation opened the way
for beginning ousting proceedings. In
Roberts’ Rules of Order Revised, it
is deﬁnitely stated that a two-thirds
vote is required to oust officers, and
that notice must be served of such
intention beforehand.

Immediately following the passage
of Derr"s motion, Andrew VV1'ight, 35,
Phi Delta Theta, moved that council
request the resignation of officers.
Wright cited, as reasons, the “irregu-
larity” charges made in the News re-
cently. The motion passed.

Vt/‘hen Cannon Fodder Revolts

Y "HID VVISDOM of whatever gods may be, our civilization has been

blessed by that glorioiis and mucli-treasiired privilege-—tlie freedom of
the press. Under this §"Llise, American newspaper readers have had to toler-
ate, time and time again, journalistic huinbug of a. character a bit unintelli-
gent and it trifle odious. Witness excerpts from the widely—read column of
one of New York city’s better—known scribblers:

“I am gi*z1l)l)iiig a few swell snickers out of the carryings-on of the
stiideiiis in some oi’ our alleged seats of learning. These y()llll°’ men, who
are often suspected of improving their noodles by spending :i few sea-
sons at the skull niir::.ei'ies, are all daffed up on the subject of war. They
liave ciavvlorl up to the conclusion that their pappies didn’t raise their

latls to be soldiers. .

“It's okay for a bevy of kids to Screech about battles, but'it’s a cinch
they don't know which end of a Springﬁeld the bullet exits from, and the
sight of a gas mask would send ’em into a deep swoon.

“They had quite a parade the other day, but I wish they would get
a union sign painter to do the decorations on the banners that they carry
around and stick into the orbs of innocent bystanders. Any let't—handed
illiterate could print better stuff than is on the posters that these saps
lug in thei strolls through the streets.”

In this manner and with this smattering of Americanese, a New York
Columnist goes forth to earn his daily bread. He should get a. bonus for his
clever phrases, “skull nurseries,” “daffed up,” and “Saps lug in their strolls."
VVe would suggest next that he write a similarly clever column on a deinoi1-
stratlon of starving textile workers and a. hilarious treatise on the thousands
in his city who have to sleep on the cold streets at night. These cases are
certainly worthy of his talent.

HILE OUR FRIEND miinches caviar on the earnings of his brilliant ob-
Wsei'vatioii of college students opposing war, let us point out that the
anti-war demonstrations waged on various eastern college campuses are not
quite as funny as he believes. The fact still remains that these young men
“HAVE crawled up to the conclusion that their puppies didn’t raise their lads
to be soldiers.” And it is about time! ‘

Anti-war feeling in colleges and universities in the United States is
spreading rapidly and will play a major role in the decade to come. More
important, anti-cannon fodder sentiment is spreading. Students are not
only interested in opposing war, they oppose the organized machines
(munitions factories, ROTC, etc.) which they think aid the cause of war.
The fight for peace is moving up on a nation-wide college front.

More important than the crusade against war itself, and it IS im-
portant, the Pitt News is proud that college students in America at last
are taking a stand for something. It is a refreshing departure from the
type of college boy who knew nothing but college yells and college foot-
ball scores.

E STILL ANTICIPATE the day when American college students, like
Wtlieii' colleagues in liiirope, will take a leading part in American political
life. To our mind, this agitation against war is a beginning, and a good one.
It college students would demonstrate against slums, against high utility
1':=l1;Etl-S, against high interest. and against many of today’s evils, something
would be done about them.

However, let us still fight against war. It isn't an inlierent trait in
men to slaughter each other. There is no necessity whatever for such
slaughter. Its toll on liiimaii lives is tremendous; its economic aftermath is
devastating.

. It is time that cannon fodder revolt. VVe are glad that cannon fodder
shows some signs of revolting. Yet, it’s sad that when cannon fodder revolts
.’-I certain journalistic Cyclops will shut his one eye and laugh.

Panhellenic Group
Plans For Dance

 

Silver, Black, Gold To Be Main
Decorations For Evening

 

It’s the men who are waiting and
the girls who are dating for the next
big dance of the year, the Panhellenic
ball, to take lslace on Friday evening,
April 27, in the ballroom of the
Twentieth Century club. The dance
is on the girls this time, with only
the worries of corsages and trans-
portation left up to the men.

According to Betty Quarrie, C34,
social chairman of Panhellenic, the
color scheme for the affair will be
silver, black and gold, with the Pan-
hellenic banner setting the main dec-
orative note. Dick Fidler’s orchestra
will provide the music for the couples
attending the ball, the annual tradi-
tional social event of the Panhellenic
council.

Favors and programs for the affair
will be combined in an unusual
souvenir being planned by Lois Mil-
liken. Three dollars is the assess-
ment price set for the dance this year.
Tickets are being sold by the Pan-
hellenic representatives in each cam-
pus sorority.

Thyrsa \V. Amos, dean of women,
will be hostess of the evening, as-
sisted by the council social con1mit-
tee.

Two hundred couples are expected}
to attend the formal affair and in-}
vitations are being sent out this week
to thirty—two faculty members and ad-
ministrative ofﬂcers. Assisting Miss
Quarrie in arrangements for the ball
is Jane Stover hlauzey, C34, Rose-
mary Kraeling, Ed36, Lois Milliken,
C35, and Martha Green, C35.

Medical Fraternity Dance

The spring social season of the Phi
Rho Sigma, medical school fraternity,
will be inaugurated tomorrow with a
formal dinner dance at the Mountain
View inn, Greensburg. Bill Leroy’s
Town Tattlers, popular campus or-
chestra, will play. As a deviation from
regular dinner dances, the dinner will
be served at midnight.

VVork Elevator Drops 38
Floors; Story Flops;
Happens Every Day

Three students were astonished and
not a little frightened while waiting
for an elevator on the twelfth floor
of the Cathedral yesterday afternoon.
Still under the inﬂuence of a geology
"lecture on rock formations in Pitts-
burgh and especially in the founda-
tion of the Cathedral, they were dis-
cussing jovially how ﬂat a wax dummy
would be if it fell from the top story
of the Cathedral on a surface as hard
as the Cathedral foundation.

Suddenly they were transﬁxed by a
loud grinding noise in the shaft of
one of the work elevators, and sud-
denly the elevator ﬂew past, a mere
ﬂash of light in the small window of
the door, Reverberating less and less,
it fell plummet-like down the shaft,
stopping with a dull thud far below.

The three students looked at each
other, One of them was an aspiring
journalist. “It’s the work elevator. Its
broke loose. I wonder if any one was
killed.” Hastily the three of them
went to the basement of the Cathe-
dral to inquire about “the wreck.”

Of how :1 witty junior nosed

A senior with a frail.

The tale, ye hcartics, goes like this:
It seems two lads were nuts
About a certain little miss

VVhose name, we’ll say, was Lutz.

The junior’s Christian name was Tom;
The senior’s name was Bert.

They both considered for the prom
The same blond, blue-eyed skirt.

Now Bert had honors, letters; he
\Vas quite the wel'-known lad.
Wyhilc two-bucks-ten and faith-in-me

\Verc all that Tommy had.

VVhen blond Miss Lutz declined to go
‘.Vith Bert, he wondered why.
That Tommy should get all the show_

W315 quite a blackened eye.

He learned the night the prom was thrown
‘\Vhy he had lost the date.

For Tom had made the timely loan
Of someone’s Ford V-8!

[Cecil Wins Prize
At ASME Meet

 

,Paper On “Hydrofoil Boat.” Is

Awarded Second Place

Owen S. Cecil, E34, was awarded
second place with a prize of $25 in
the contest at the annual ASME con-
vention here Monday and Tuesday
for his paper on “A Hydrofoil Boat
Design.”

First place, with a prize of $50,
went to C_ Addison Hempstead ox‘.
Ohio State university, and third, $10,
was awarded to Arthur M, Gompf,
Johns Hopkins university,

Cecil based his paper on actual
model tests made in the Pitt swim-‘
111lll_9; pool and in the Schenley park
pond. Within the next month, he ex-
pects to make river tests with a man-
carrying model measuring 12 feet
from how to stern. The hydrofoil is
four inches wide with a variable
length according to speed. It will
have a take-off force of 1,250 pounds
and a cruising support of 500 pounds.
He has designed a special gear and
shaft for the motor, and in tests made
without the hydrofoil, be attained a
speed of 20 miles per hour. The ob-
ject of the hydrofoil is, in reducing
the wave resistance, greatly to in-
crease the speed.

Selling by telephone gets results. In many lines
of business, salesmen are ﬁnding they can cover
more customers more often—and close more sales
at lower cost——by telephone.

Bell System men have worked out a number
of plans for systematic market coverage by Long
Distance telephone. They have also devised tele-
phone plans for more efficient handling of pro-
duction, purchasing, administration, distribution,

Because Bell System service is fast, economi-

cal, adaptablc to speciﬁc needs, business more and
more turns to the telephone.

Pitt Men Ready
For First Meet
Here Tomorrow

 

Oppose Owls In Initial Duals
Contest Of Track Season;
Sophomores Watched

Pitt track fans will get their ﬁrst
glimpse of Coach Olson’s outﬁt for
outdoor meets when the Panthers op-
pose Temple’s Owls in a dual meet
at the Stadium tomorrow. The events
are scheduled to get under way at 2
o’clock.

Most of the Panther eiitries will be
carried over from those men who com-
peted for Pitt during the past indoor
season. One item of particular in-
terest will be checking the perform-
a.nces of the numerous sophomore
trackers who are getting their bap-
tism of ﬁre in varsity outdoor com-
petition. All of these boys appear.
ready to go, with the exception of‘
Bill l\'IcMunn, sophomore dash man.
McMunn pulled a leg muscle in the
middle of the indoor season and Olson
is making the speedster take things
easy for a while yet.

From all reports, the Owls will
bring a strong squad here for the
meet. The Panthers are anticipating
a tough time of it throughout, with
especially brilliant races being her-
alded in the mile and the half-mile.
Ken Vvagenhouser will duel with Fed-
eroff, Temple’s sensational distance
man, in the former event while Bill
Keller will vie with Davis, Philadel-
phia ha1f—miler, in the latter. If the
Panther men can win out in these
two races, Pitt's chances for taking
the meet will be considerably bright.

trophies, and placed on a plane of
open participation for a.ll women in
the University

an event for women’s fraternities, all

the 145-pound division this year and
won the 145-pound title. Russell
Bedillion, wrestling in the 135—pound
ranks won the championship in that
weight division.

Earl Oster and John Valenti were
both representing the University, up
as far as the semi-finals, both were
defeated in their ﬁnal matches,

Pitt third.

 

Panther Cagers

Resume Practice

 

Dr. Carlson Expects Squad Of 22
To Report Monday

 

Their brief vacation now being just
about over, the Pitt basketeers will
don uniforms once more on Monday
afternoon when the regular spring
practice sessions get under way.

Faced with the problem of ﬁlling
the places left vacant by the absence
of Don McCamant, Charley Hughes,
and Russ Ochsenhirt, all of whom
have ﬁnished their varsity careers, Dr.
Carlson is starting his spring drills
early and in earnest. The Panther
coach is expecting a squad of 22 men
to turn out for the session Monday.

However, the fact that capable re-
placements are available from last
year’s second team and that several
star performers coming up from the
freshman team gives some rays of
hope to the Pitt basketball cause.
Ross Emerick, Billy Jesko, and Ralph
Ferguson look like varsity material,
if their performances on the yearling
team are any indication. '

Heading those left over from last
year’s secondstringers will be Pete
Noon, who is fast becoming a cra.ck
basketball player; Ted Roderick, a
clever forward; and Ken Kuno, who
turned in some nice work at guard
this past season.

Of course. there will be the co-
captains, Skip Hughes and Claire
Cribbs, whose merits are pretty gen-
erally known and, who are out to
make their last season of varsity
competition their best.

 

Nick Names

The football players have found a new han-
dle for Weisenbaugh. Formerly he was known
as "Hienie,” then it was “Wedge Head.” and
now he is known ‘as “Hi’cler.”‘ Hanley, be-
