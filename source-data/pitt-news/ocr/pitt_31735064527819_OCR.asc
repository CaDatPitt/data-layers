(5 Byjim Tezak

News Editor

Lieutenantjorge Arteaga, a Pitt graduate,
married Emily Gardner in an Arkansas
courthouse only three weeks ago, just
hours before his unit left for the Persian
Gulf. V

The two had planned to marry in May
but changed their plans when Arteaga
found out he was being sent to the gulf. A
court clerk said that Gardner put on her
white lace dress in the car on the way to

ythe courthouse.

. Arteaga, 26, -was killed in the Persian
Gulf on Saturday when his plane crashed
while returning from a bombing raid.

Arteaga, a bombardier navigator aboard

a B-52 bomber, and two other airmen
died when the plane suffered a massive
electrical failure and crashed into the
Indian Ocean while returning to its base
at Diego Garcia. Three members of the
plane ’s crew ejected upward and survived.
Three others ejected downward, but the
plane was apparently too close to the
water already and all three were killed.

Arteaga graduated from Pitt in 1987
with a bachelor’s degree in computer
science, according to Trish White, a
communications representative for
University Relations. He was a non-
scholarship member of the Air Force
ROTC while at Pitt.

“He was in the program because he
wanted to be. He was in the Air Force

because he wanted to be. That was his
dream, to ﬂy for the Air Force, " said Clarke
Simmons, a former roommate of Arteaga’s.

Simmons and Arteaga lived together
while both were attending Carnegie Mellon
during the 1984-85 school year. Simmons,
a member of the Army ROTC, said that
they met in the Rangers, a joint program
between ROTC units at Pitt and CM.

Simmons remembered that while
Arteaga’s first name was pronounced
“Hoor—hay,” he was always just “George”
to his friends.

“He was your basically good guy,”
Simmons said. “He wasn’t real quiet, but
he wasn’t extremely outgoing.” _

Arteaga, a native of Bolivia, lived in the

'North Hills when he was younger.

sert Storm

According to Simmons, Arteaga could
speak three languages: English, Spanish
and Portuguese.

His father was a mining engineer for
U.S. Steel and later held the same job with
the United Nations. Arteaga’s parents were
at home in Bolivia when they were notiﬁed
of their son’s death.

According to an AP wire report, Arteaga’s
father believed-that his son was “serving a
just cause” in the war against Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein. I

A funeral will be held at Arlington
National Cemetery. A date has not been
set, and the body has not been recovered
yet. Simmons, who currently lives in
Arlington, Va., said that he plans to attend
the ceremony. ‘

 

Big East

Sports Editor

The Big East Conference
formally announced yesterday the
formation of its Division I football
network.

The eight—member conference
will include present Big East
members University of Pittsburgh,
Boston College, University of
Miami and Syracuse University,
with new additions Rutgers Univ-
ersity, Temple University, Virginia
Tech and West Virginia University
admitted for football only.

Big East football will begin this
fall on a limited basis. Round-
robin conference scheduling will
not take place this season, but
the Big East will have its own
officiating bureau and syndicated
television package in the fall.

“I think that some people on
the outside had some doubts of
where the Big East was heading
six months ago, but with the
addition of Miami and now today’s

An administrative proposal to
eliminate Pitt’s Office for Faculty
Development received strong
opposition from the Faculty
Assembly yesterday.

Toby Chapman, co—chairperson
of the senate educational policies
committee, called for the Faculty
Assembly to support the retention
of OFD without a cut in funding.

OFD provides Pitt faculty
members with advice about

improving their teaching skills.
Its responsibilities include
“providing aid to individual
faculty in improving teaching and
developing programs and
workshops for teaching
development at the university,”
said Chapman. It videotapes
classes and provides professional
consultation for faculty members
about the quality of their teaching.

According to Chapman, the
administration is eliminating the
OFD because of budgetary
considerations. “[The elirninationl

would save $147,000 a year,” he
said.

The university proposal
suggested that administrators in
individual offices take over the
duties currently performed by
OFD. The proposal also cited
OFD’s history of inadequate
funding and staffing as reasons
for its discontinuation.

However, Chapman said that
the elimination is a mistake, since
it would stop the consultation
which OFD’s professional staff
provides to the faculty, even

though other services would be
retained.

Chapman said it was his
committee ’s conse nsus that OFD’s
staff and services are valuable to
Pitt faculty and could not be
adequately replaced by
administrators. _

“There is a need for remedial
services for those faculty found
to have weaknesses as teachers
on the basis of such evaluations.
Also, the emphasis on maintaining
quality in teaching as larger—

Meaning of David Lawrence

By Howard Goodman
Sta_ﬁ“Wr1‘ter

There are many unsolved
mysteries in the world. Some of
the more puzzling include the
disappearance of ships in the
Bermuda Triangle, the giant
statues on Easter Island and the
interesting pattern of wooden
blocks on the side walls of the
David Lawrence Hall auditorium.

Students often ponder this
pattern during lectures. Many are
so bored in class that they pay
more attention to the walls than to
the instructor.

The pattern is comprised of 24
single blocks and 34 double-length
blocks and is duplicated on both
sides of the auditorium. '

/One might wonder what hidden
or insightful meaning this design
holds. ,

A picture in the dedication
booklet for David Lawrence Hall
from Thursday, June 17, 1971,
shows a blank wall. The wooden
blocks did not exist at that time;
they were added at some later
date.

Hillman Library, Telefact, The
PittNews morgue and the Hillman
Library archives department show
no record of this addition.

George Balta, an architect for
facilities management, said that
the addition was made in 1974,
but he was unsure why the blocks
were added.

“I assume they were placed
there for acoustical reasons —— to
help better break up sound,” he
said‘.

Students who attend lectures
in the room, though, have their
own explanations.

Some students were
philosophical about the unsolved
mystery.

According to senior David
Goldberg, “The wall symbolizes
how your college education is
like a puzzle, and you have to try
and fit the pieces together to
form your way of life. If you put

the last two sets of four vertical
rows of loose blocks together,
they form a solid rectangle with
seven vertical block by four
horizontal block dimensions.”
See Blocks, page 3

blocks remains a mystery

By Jeff Tatusko
Contributing Editor

Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Colin
Powell will be traveling to Saudi Arabia
later in the week, according to news
reports. —

According to Pentagon spokesman Pete
Williams, Cheney and Powell will meet
with Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf,
commander of the U.S. forces in the
Persian Gulf. Schwarzkopf will reportedly
give the Pentagon leaders an update on
the situation.

President Bush said this trip does not
mean that a ground war is imminent.

sources said that it was meant to keep
Saddam Hussein “on his toes.”

-As many as 10 more Iraqi jets have
flown into Iran. U.S. Gen. Robertjohnston
said yesterday that the planes crossed the
border overnight. Iran confirmed that four
jets came into the country.

yesterday that 1-Q8 Iraqi ~ civilians have

The town, approximately 90 miles north
of Baghdad, had been under intensive fire

-The “Mighty Mo” has returned to action.

The U.S.S. Missouri, a World War II

Pentagon officials said that the Missouri,
which can fire its 2,000—pound shells over
25 miles into an area the size of a tennis
court, had been attacking Iraqi troop

At the beginning of the conflict, it was

Luzar said, “The blocks redirect

MARGAHITA PIZZA

By Leon Fuksman
Staﬂ“ Writer

Israel is the result of centuries of change
in Jewish thought and religion, said a Pitt
professor during a lecture Monday night.

Religious studies Professor Alex Orbach
traced the evolution from traditional
Judaism to Zionism, a modern movement
stressing the development of the Jewish
state of Israel.

“Zionism has allowed the Jews who
have been persecuted a haven to live in,”
said Pitt senior Marc Reiter, coordinator of
the lecture and president of Masada at Pitt
and Carnegie Mellon. “In Israel these
people experience democracy and

freedom of religion, which is more
preferable than where they lived before.”

Orbach said Zionism is a rebellion against
traditional Jewish thought and experience.

Traditional Judaism involves following
Jewish law and living in exile because of
persecution. He said this movement
changed during the Reformation, when
Jews lived alongside Christians throughout
Europe.

Many of the Jews called themselves
Hebrews and Israelis during this period in
order to be rid of some of the stereotypes
associated with the word “Jew.” '

“A Jew was seen as a negative person
who lived in ghettos and stole in the
streets," said Orbach.

4 THE PIT!‘ NEWS. Wednesday, February 6, 1991
 

Prof traces Israel’s evolution from Judaism to Zionism

Following the Reformation, some writers
and philosophers questioned the traditional
values associated with marriage, education
and religion. These intellectuals wanted
the Jews to combine their religious
education with math, science and literature,
in order to blend them into society.

Orbach said other thinkers believed that
Jews could only live among themselves in
a united nation. These early Zionist
beliefs led to the formation of Israel.

“History has shown thatJews cannot be
accepted into the mainstream of society,"
said soph-omore Michael Smlevich, a mem-
ber of Israel Committee. “Israel is the only
place that Jews have left after everything
has failed."

But the idea of having a united Jewish
state has raised controversy among the
Jews, Orbach said. Some Zionists believe
allJews should inhabit Israel, while others
think Jews need to live all over the world
to spread monotheism.

Pitt senior Carrie Bernard, vice president
of Masada, spent a semester in Tel Aviv
and said every Jew can't live in Israel.

“The idea that all Jews should live in
Israel is good, but it’s not for everyone.
Israelis have a mixed view of Americans;
unless Americans go to Israel, they are not
true Jews," said Bernard.

The lecture was sponsored by B’nai
B’rith Hillel, UnitedJewish Federation and
Masada/Students for Israel.

Spring Break trips different in cost, quality

By Andrea Guilfoy

For the Pitt News

Spring break is approaching,
and with all the different
companies competing for
students’ money, it’s hard to tell
which trip is really the best.

A lot of companies claim to
have the best deal around, and
many students are looking closely
at the costs, hotel
accommodations and type of
transportation these companies
offer. .

The Pitt Program Council is
offering a trip to Daytona Beach
for $244 per person for a four-
occupant room. This trip
competes with a variety of other
companies offering Daytona trips

ranging in price from $119 to
$486.

A Sunchase ad prices Daytona
as low as $119. The only catch is
that the offer is for a five-night
stay from March 11 to 16, which
falls right after Pitt’s spring break.
Sunchase’s seven—night stay,
March 2 to 9, costs $149 per
person for four-person
occupancy or $159 with a
kitchenette. The trip does not
include transportation.

Tammy Tamlin, a
spokesperson for Sunchase, said

the Daytona trip is popular with

students, and that in the last 10

Student Focus
Group

Computing and Information Services(C|S) has developed a forum for student input concerning the
University's student computing services. This forum, the Computing and Information Services Student
Focus Group, has been meeting since September 1989.

The goal of the Focus Group is to review the computing lab services offered by CIS and to provide
input regarding the future direction of the labs.

The Focus Group is seeking interested individuals to join. If you would like to participate, please
attend the next meeting of the Student Focus Group on:

Misuraca said that PPC is part
of the university, which gives
students an advantage.

“We're not here to make
money,” he said. “The cost passe
on to students is strictly what is
charged to us per person, and if
you come in here and give us
your money, we’re not going to
disappear. We're accountable to-
the university.

“What we are here to do is
provide students with the hi ghest—
quality trip at the most reasonable
price,” said Misuraca, “and I
believe we do that, based on the
turnout and positive reactions of
the students each year.”

Sara Crable, a junior at Pitt, said
her trip with the PPC was worth

 

the money, and she’d like to do it 3*

again. “The people were really
nice; they told you everything
you could and couldn't do
beforehand so there were no
surprises,” she said.

“I picked the Pitt Program
Council trip because I heard from
a lot of people that they had a
very good reputation and the
price was reasonable for what
they were offering," said Lisa
Santos, a senior nursing student.
“They were very well organized
and treated the students with
respect. It was deﬁnitely worth
the money, and I'd recommend
the trip to anyone that was
considering it.”

The Panther Scuba Club offers
a different type of trip to Florida.
Students will travel to Key Largo,
Key West and Fort Lauderdale to
scuba dive over spring break.

Paul Frustaci, vice president of
the club, said the trip will cost
students about $350, which
includes the hotel, transportation
and scuba fees. For students who
don’t scuba dive, the trip will run
somewhat less.

Students will spend the first
night or two in Key Largo, the
next couple of days in Key West
and the remainder of the trip in
Fort Lauderdale, according to
Frustaci.

“The trip is nice in the sense
that you’re not stuck in one hotel;
students that aren’t diving can go
out on the boat, and students on
the trip have a lot to say about
what they want to do and where
they want to go,” said Frustaci.

However, students who wish

East

Continued from page 1
Television Network.

Conference members will begin
to play a minimum of five
conference games as soon as
possible but no later than 1995.
Also, administrators fully intend
to determine a conference
champion as early as this year,
giving rise to the idea of
implementing the league as soon
as possible.

“lSchedulingl is our goal. By
1995 our schools will all play at
least five conference games. We’re
not looking to go out and break
scheduling contracts. We’re going
to try to work things out in an
agreeable manner,” Tranghese
said. '

“Shortly, our executive commit-
tee will announce how we will
determine a conference champion
for 1991,.”

A major component of
conference alignment is revenue

gsharing of gate receipts, television

contract monies, bowl revenues,
etc. The exact formula has not
been revealed concerning which
revenues will be shared and how
they will be divided. But Big East
football is not going to treat its
members evenly when it comes
to money.
“There is a basic [revenue-
sharing] formula in place. But let
us remind people that in
basketball, we don’t just throw
all of the money in the pot and
divide it evenly. We have always
rewarded the schools that have
been successful,” Tranghese said.
If a member school attempts to
withdraw from the league, the
school is subject to substantial
financial penalties for failing to
live up to its expectations as a
member. Again, the duration of
the contract for the eight schools
has not been specified, but
Tranghese said that the agreement
is one of the longest—standing

Expanding the Big East...

Ten years ago, the Big East was founded under the
direction of Dave Gavitt. The conference included all
sports, with the exception of football, from nine schools.

i That exception is about to become a thing of the past.

The conference announced yesterday that it was forming
a division for football to compete in Division I. The group
had been attempting this for quite a while and had already
gained acceptance from four schools: Pitt, Boston College,
Syracuse and Miami. I

The conference has gained the official acceptance of
four other schools for football only: Temple,‘ Rutgers,
West Virginia and Virginia Tech. This means that none of
these schools will join the Big East conference for other
sports. » r _

As an independent football school, Pitt was losing out
to major conferences in television deals and bowl bids.
Although it has not been officially eliminated from its
schedule, Pitt could face the loss of its biggest rival, Penn,
State, which joined the Big‘1O last year.

Now that the Panthers have their own conference,
money will come in more frequently. The conference is
currently negotiating contracts with both ABC and ESPN
to televise its games nationally.

With more exposure, the university could not only gain

, credibility but recruits as well. Once a school. is visible,

prospective athletes see more of it, increasing the possibility

. for more quality players while" improving the league

overall. . i _
Another ﬁnancial interest lies with an automatic bowl

f bid for the winner of the conference. The conference has

established a committee to look into this possibility. So

far, many bowls have taken an interest, most notably the

Fiesta Bowl. ,

Remaining independent at this time places a football
program in a very precarious position. Without conference.
affiliation, most schools will eventually lose out on
money, scheduling and prospective bowl bids. Notre
Dame is an exception because of its prestige, but schools
such as this are few and far between.

Schools in this conference, such as Pitt and Miami, are
normally highly competitive in football. Hopefully, with
this type of schedule, Pitt can look forward to, if not
maintaining an old rivalry, at least establishing new ones
in the near future.

We are in a war for freedom

Picture this: The United States
is attacked by Saddam Hussein.
Would you protest this war? That
answer should be a resounding
“no,” but what a lot of us are
failing to realize is that Saddam is
attacking something that we as
American citizens take for granted
—— freedom. I

Saddam has taken away
Kuwait’s freedom by invading it.
He has also taken away its citizens’
sense of security. Our troops -—
our brothers, sisters, husbands,
wives and friends ,— are over in
the Persian Gulf fighting for this
freedom, among other reasons.

“Hell no! I won’t go! I won't die
for Texaco!” was shouted in my
face as I observed the peace
protests/on Jan. 14. This person
believed we are fighting a war for
oil. It is my opinion that this
could be considered a war for
freedom.

Saddam can be compared to
Adolph Hitler. Hitler wanted ‘
Austria and took it, but when he
wasn’t satisfied with that, he tried
to take part of Czechoslovakia,
which he also got. It took an
invasion of Poland to generate
enough cause against him to start
World War II. ‘What country will
Saddam want next if he isn't
stopped now? Saudi Arabia?
Jordan? We are all aware of the”
terror he has inﬂicted upon the
Kuwaiti citizens and Israel, so

* what's next? Not one of us knows

for sure what Saddam will do if
he isn’t stopped now. I don’t
want to ﬁnd out what he is capable

  Chrissy
Cortazzo

of doing, either.

I feel that we,’as Americans,
have an obligation to support
our troops wholeheartedly. Even
if we have different opinions on
the war or why American soldiers
are in the gulf, remember that
there are thousands of women
and men willing to die for
freedom and the principles of
our country and others as well.

A student at Pitt recently
received a letter from a soldier in
Saudi Arabia known only as “J.E. , ”

‘whose address she received from

a newspaper article. J.E. is a
corporal and a combat engineer
for the Marines. He has been
stationed on the front lines near
Kuwait since Aug. 10. A
J.E.’s assignment in Operation
Desert Storm, as one of the ﬁrst
marines to arrive in Saudi Arabia,
is to make a path across the
Kuwaiti border by clearing out

all of the land mines Saddam has «

planted. I
J.E. wrote “What do you think
of the situation over here? I'm
curious as to what you're
hearing.”J.E. continuedby saying
that the soldiers’ morale is affected
by realizing what a dangerous
situation they are in. “Have you
heard about a couple of
servicemen shooting themselves?
There's a lot that happens over

here that doesn't get back to the
States.” i

It seems that their morale is
also affected by what they hear
from the United States. The
protests that are taking place are
making the soldiers feel thatU.S.

. citizens aren’t supportive of what

the soldiers are facing in the gulf.
I was watching a news broadcast
on which the mother of a soldier

said that her son is afraid to come I

home because he doesn't want to

be treated like the Vietnam

veterans were.

The soldiers need to know that
what they are doing is appreciated
and that they have a country
behind them, not a country
protesting what they believe in
and are ﬁghting for.

I am very proud of the troops ’,

in Saudi Arabia, and I stand behind
them. Ibelieve thatawise decision
was made in choosing to ﬁght in
the gulf. Saddam Hussein must
realize that his terroristic ways
will not be tolerated. Freedom
and the rights of people in this
world is something we will ﬁght
for.

You maynot agree with whatl
believe in, and that is your
opinion, which I value. But I
stand firmly behind my belief
that we must begin showing our
soldiers in Operation Desert Storm
that they have a country standing
behind them by showing them
our full support!

Hackett gears up

By Mike Rampa I
Sports Editor

With the formation of the Big East
football conference only a day old, Pitt
head football coach Paul Hackett has had
little time to ponder the ramifications of a
once—distant proposal that has recently
turned into reality. But all signs show that
he’s just as pleased as Punch about directing
a football team andbuilding a program
that has kept its roots in the East.

Coupled with the fact that Hackett is
coming off his first season as a head coach
at Pitt are the problems he faced while‘
serving as a head coach at a school which
was clamoring to find some type of
conference alignment. The perils of
remaining a football independent in an
age of conference mania riddled Hackett’s
programs with difﬁculties in recruiting,
television exposure, bowl bids and general-
revenue generation.

But now the goals of his program have
become a little more focused, thanks to
seven other schools (Miami, Virginia Tech,
West Virginia, Rutgers, Temple, Syracuse
and Boston College) and conference
commissioner Michael Tranghese.

“lConference affiliation] gives us our
own group of teams to identify with. I
think that’s positive in recruiting and the‘
way I talk to the football team,” Hackett
said.

“It gives me an opportunity to talk about
a goal, a clear—cut goa1——the championship
of the conference —— not the national
championship or [one] game because we’re
an independent. We have to start at the
beginning, and the beginning is to win the
Big East Conference, and I like that. I think
that’s very healthy for a football team.
Every game is important because every

game we play can control how [we] stand ‘
in the [conference] standings,” he added.

One of Big East football's most prized
possessions will be the eventual bowl tie-
in at the end of the season. The Fiesta
Bowl, as well as others, has expressed
interest in the ﬂedgling conference, but

.post—season. play is the least of Hackett’s

worries.

“The assumption is that in time, when
this thing gets rolling, [hopefully] we'll
find a direction to go for a bowl. But for us
right now, we’re just trying to win a few
games. [The bowl] is for the conference
people to worry about,” Hackett said.

With the recent loss of Curvin Richards
to the NFL draft and the star. tailback’s
public complaints about the football
program's academic policy, Hackett has

stood tall and stands by his decisions in‘

upholding his academic standards for the
entire football team, regardless of a player’s
status. Keeping with his overview of an
entire football program as simply a part of
a larger educational system, Hackett does

 

not concern himself with how strong the
new Big East football conference will be at

first. Staying true to form, he concerns

himself with how this conference will
grow in the future.

“What I count on is that the people who
put this conference together are looking at
universities that have a lot of things in
common. Certainly one of them is football,
but the kind of educational schools they
are, where they're located, [as welll” he
said. a A

“lWe’rel bringing together a group of
people that are‘ going to have a close—knit
relationship over a long period of time.
We're going to find that rivalries are going
to grow out of it that we really don’t have
today. In time, you recruit against them;
you get to know more about them. You
gather more respect for them.”

The addition of the Miami Hurricanes
has prompted many discussions about
how the football powerhouse will either
enhance or hinder the other member
schools’ recruiting programs. Since the
Hurricanes have produced three national-
championship teams in the 1980s (1983,
’87, '89), the concern certainly seems
warranted.

But Hackett believes the addition of the
mighty Hurricanes will actually enhance
Pitt’s recruiting. Pitt had traditionally done

’ fairly well in recruiting from the Sunshine

State in the past, and Hackett sees the

  

  for tenure in Big East football

trend as improving.

“When you recruit people in Florida, it’s
nice to be able to say that you can ﬂick on
the television and see Big East football all
the time because of that association. Many
of the kids that think about committing to
the East from Florida are concerned about

-the television exposure and whether their

families and friends are going to see them
play.‘ With the development of television
we anticipate going along with the Big
East conference will help us in recruiting,”
Hackett said. ‘ A

Finally, the second—year coach does not
think the formation of this conference is a
drastic change from his team's competition‘
over past years. Pitt has already seen the
likes of BC, Syracuse, Temple and Rutgers
over the years.

A few more additions to the Easﬂ The

more, the merrier.
“It’s something that’s very natural; I
think once I got to know the feelings

about eastern football and the Big East _
" area, it became a very natural move. I'm ,,

very excited about it. --
"We already have the Syracuse, BC,
Temple, Rutgers, and now you add [the
others] into it. Pretty much this is what we
have been doing. Now it’s formalized, and

you bring in a few others. I'm very excited‘

about it,” Hackett said. _
‘ Now it’s time to get excited about the

Pitt’s Antoine jones fulfilling preseason expectations in 1991

By Rob Mazur
Staff Writer

When AntoineJones transferred
to Pitt from Allegheny Junior
College (Md), big things were
expected of him.

Jones averaged over 18 points
a game and shot 55 percent from
the ﬂoor. His team was ranked
13th in the nation and finished
30-6. He was named Most
Valuable Player of the Maryland
Junior College Tournament.

He was described by Panther
center Bobby Martin as “our
Dennis Rodman —— only Antoine
has a better shooting touch.” Pitt
Coach Paul Evans said, “He’s a
good defensive player and a good
offensive rebounder, so Isee him
getting quite a bit of time.”

 

Things changed, though, when
Jones suffered a groin pull and a
sore back at the beginning of the
year. “I lost my confidence in my
shot after my injury. Without my
confidence I wasn’t playing up to
the level that I was capable of,”
said Jones.

Things took a positive turn for
Jones Monday night, as he had an
impressive outing against the
Seton Hall Pirates, helping Pitt to
an 86-80 victory.

Jones came off the bench to
play 16 minutes, scoring six
points, grabbing four rebounds
and blocking two shots.

“It’s great to have my
confidence back. I try to play
good defense and rebound
strongly. I will have to try to put
these things together with my

scoring and‘ try to get my game
back,” said Jones.

Jones had a key block late in
the second half when he denied
the Ha1l’s Gordon Winchester a
sure breakaway basket. “He beat
me getting back down the court.
I knew that if I didn’t getback, he
would have two points. I just
tried to get back and save the
basket,” said Jones.

“Antoine came in and played *

great defense for us,” said Evans.
“He had a couple of blocked
shots and rebounded pretty well.
He’s so much looser now than he
was two weeks ago. He made his
foul shots. He wasn’t as tight with
his jump shot as he has been. I
think if he had not gotten hurt at
the beginning of the year, it would

not have taken him this long to »

get to this level.”

Evans also said the Big East
Conference should adopt some
kind of policy regarding the
transfer of junior-college players
into the league.

“The Big Ten has a rule where
they have to sit out for a year now
when they transfer from a junior
college, which is not a bad rule.
Tico Cooper played miserably
for [former Pitt Coach Roy]
Chipman, and the first year I had
him, he got into it pretty good.

“If he had sat out the year he
first got here and had another
year to play, he would have been
very good,” said Evans. “The same
thing applies with Antoine. He’s
just starting to get into it, and he’ll
probably have a good year next
year.” \

Jones attributed his newfound ‘

confidence and success to senior
captain Darelle Porter. “I wasn’t

Bratton emerging as force to be reckoned Wi Eas

By Beth Kovaly
For The Pitt News

Although this is only Kathryn

' Bratton’s freshman year, she is

already the No. 2 tennis player
for the Lady Panthers.

She started playing tennis when
she was eight years old but wasn’t
serious about it until middle
school. Before coming to Pitt,

_ she placed in the District Three

Championships, state qualifiers
and marry singles/doubles
tournaments. And if anybody
is dedicated to tennis, it’s this
woman.

“She’s really into tennis. There’s
never been a day when she gives
less than 1 10 percent. She’ll make
timebecause she loves to play,”
said Bratton’s teammate and
roommate, Josie Neiswenter.

Besides the daily practice
schedule for the team, Bratton
tries to play during the team’s off-

weekends in addition to working A

out.

“She works out, runs, jumps
rope .. in fact, she runs from
[North Oakland] to the Cost Center
in five minutes!” said Neiswenter.
The Cost indoor complex is
behind Trees Hall (as anyone
who has made the hike knows).

Bratton originally chose Pitt for

The recent trend of alternating

‘S warm and cold spells has been

taking its toll on the health of Pitt
students, and the women’s

‘ gymnastics team has not escaped.

The Lady Panthers fought off
colds as they competed in New
England last weekend, ﬁnishing

second on Saturday with a score \

of 179.65, behind the University
of Massachusetts (181.60) and
ahead of Yale University (173.45).

its physical—therapy program, but
she has changed her mind about
that major.

Now she is interested in art
education but sees the future as
open to possibilities. She divides
her time mostly between tennis
and academics.

“Not to make it seem like tennis
is my life," she joked, “but you
don't have time to do much more.
I’ve had to make sacriﬁces, sure
 but I don't look at them as
sacrifices. I set my priorities.”

Academics is a major concern
of tennis coach George
Dieffenbach as well.

“The main thing I want for my
players is to study and get their
education. I look upon the tennis
experience as a way to have fun
—— to bring out the best in the
player," he said.

Dieffenbach is very pleased
with Bratton’s first season at Pitt.

“She came in with a good
background for Division I tennis
and was thrown into a high
position [No. 2] as a freshman.
She’s made a good adjustment.
She is a very disciplined
individual. When someone is as
dedicated as Kathryn, it breeds
respect among fellow players.”

The tennis season stretches
through both semesters with a

“This is the first time that we’ve
gone up to New England and we
haven't had to leave people at
home,” said head coach Debbie
Yohman.

“This time of the season is cold
season. Everybody gets run
down,” said Kathy Wallish. “But
I think that a couple of people
had it, and a couple of people
picked it up, but after the second
day [of competition] it just makes
you have to work harder.”

On Sunday, Pitt took third place A

with a score of 179.70, behind

heavy load in the fall, especially
during the Big East
Championships. Bratton is
looking forward to next year’s
Big East Championships already.

“When I went before, I didn’t
have that much college
experience. I think I was really
nervous. There were a lot of
expectations for me — for the
team. Next year it’ll be a lot
different because I know what to
expect.”

Last semester she went with
teammate Julie LoPrinzi to the
I.T.C.A. Rolex Championships,
the largest eastern tennis
championships. Although
defeated in the first round by
Harvard (which eventually won
the meet), Bratton has a very
positive attitude.

“Every time I’m on the court,
I’m giving 100 percent. Win or
lose, you give it your all.”

Neiswenter said, “The natural
reaction when you know your
opponent is better is, ‘Oh, we’re

going to get crushed!’ Kathryn

says, ‘At least I did my best; I gave

it my best shot,’ and she’s proud \

of how she did.”

Bratton has an even .500 record
in both singles and doubles (8-8
and ‘ 9-9, respectively).
Dieffenbach said she0 should feel

During Sunday’s competition
the Lady Panthers posted a new
school record of 46.75 in the
floor exercise, which broke the
record of 46.40 that the squad
had set the week before.

A slight altercation took place
last weekend between Pitt
assistant gymnastics coach Ben
Rovee and URI head coach
Charles Connery.

According to Rovee and several
of the members of Pitt's

“ gymnastics team, the women

were heading to present
themselves to the balance-beam
judges after the rotation
announcement was called, when
Connery grabbed Rovee by the
arm and began to yell at him.
Connery accused Rovee and
the Pitt squad of cheating because

The Lady Panthers were in the
lead as they went into their final
event, the balance beam, on
Sunday, but the Pitt squad’s
performanceswere not as good
as usual.

The Lady Panthers scored a
43.2 on the beam, their lowest
beam score this season.

“We lost this meet on the
balance beam,” said Yohman.

“[It’s bad] when everybody on
your team falls, and the one that
didn’t fall was shaky and only
went 9.0.”

Yohman said that she was not

said, “Tennis is an ‘out’ for me. It

the excellent ﬂoor performance,

them because our floor

said Jeanne Vecchio.

This weekend the Lady

The Lady Panthers are looking

THE Pl'I'I' NEWS, Wednesday, February 6, 1991 , 2

T rack star Cm

By Greg Wallace
For The Pitt News

There is a rising star on the Big East track
and field scene. She is running for Pitt, and
her name is Ronise Crumpler.

As a freshman last year, Crumpler posted
season-best times for the team in the 50-
yard dash (5.94), the 55 meters (6.96), 60
meters (7.53), 200 meters (24.24) and 500

meters 0:14.15). She also set records in I

the 800-meter relay (1:41.00), the 1600

meter relay 6:41.33) and the 3200-meter 

relay (9:O9.16).

When she ﬁrst came to Pitt, the Virginia 

native said that she was tired of running in

high school. But after she met the team 

and coaches, her attitude turned around.

“Before I came here, I was really tired of
running," Crumpler said. “But when I
came here and got acquainted with the
team and coach [Steve Lewis], I saw how
they pushed each other, and they were
really together on running and helping
each other out.

“I liked how they inspired each other in
practice as well because I didn’t have that
in high school. But when I came here my
times dropped tremendously from what I
was running in high school. It was like I
had a whole new attitude. Now I’m just
concentrating on running faster than I did
last year.”

Crumpler struggled a bit when she first
arrived on the scene and wasn't completely

Pitt News File Photo

Ronise Crumpler.

satisﬁed with her performances. Although
she was logging better times than in high
school, she felt there was still room for
improvement.

“I talked to Coach Lewis and asked him
about the times,” Crumpler said. “He told
me that at the beginning _of the year we
didn’t have many big meets, and I didn’t
have anyone there to really push me
besides my teammates.”

Crumpler improved steadily as her
freshman year went on.She said she is
running better this year than last season,
and she is eager to get to this season's
bigger meets.

“At this point I'm still working on getting

consistent running times,” she said. “I feel
I'm getting more in shape now and getting
stronger because the weight training and
the running itself is a lot harder than last
year. I still have some way to go because
there is a difference between running to
win and running for a good time. It's still
the beginning.”

When it comes to the team aspect of her
competition, she pulls no punches about
the quality of athletes on the Pitt team.

“We're one of the best. We have great
mental and physical preparation, and we
have a togethemess on this team that is a
little different than most teams. We really
stick together and encourage each other

_ to do our best,” she said.

Crumpler credited much of her success
to her coaches and teammates, who have
pushed her to excel at her work, both on
and off the track

She especially credited teammate Keisha
Demas, who has guided Crumpler ever
since she arrived at Pitt.

“I look up to Keisha a lot,” Crumpler
said. “She's a great runner, and she pushes
me. I talk to her, especially when I don’t
feel right about running or if I’m not sure
about a race. She helps me out and
encourages me."

Crumpler is equally admired by her
teammates, especially Demas, who
believes that through running they can
both learn from each other.

“This is my chance to give her the

mpler has brighter and faster days ahead

opportunity to learn from me. Hopefully
next year she’s going to be the person that
teaches. If she continues to grow the way
she has, she’ll be a premier athlete," Demas
said.

Women's coach Steve Lewis also thinks
highly of Crumpler, although he puts her
talent in perspective since she is still_a
sophomore.

“Since she’s just going into her second
year of competition, this is deﬁnitely not
the end," Lewis said. “She has a bright
future in track and has the tools to become
an athlete of national caliber."

As far as her future is concerned,
Crumpler feels the most important aspect
is to improve, not only as a sprinter, but
also as a person.

“I want to improve in track and maybe
run professionally,” Crumpler said. “I also
hope to get into business and earn a dual
major in business and sociology. I would
like to get out, enter an occupation, be
well off and help others.”

Crumpler, like most, has dreams. But
she takes challenges one at a timeand
encourages people around her to do the
same.

“I always think about becoming a
professional,”~ Crumpler said, “but
sometimes I get discouraged, lazy or
wonder if I’m tough enough. So I just
continue to work at becoming one of the
best runners out there. If you have dreams,
you must keep working toward them.”

Women's swim team serves as first-time underdogs

By Arthur Graziani
For The Pitt News ‘

This weekend the women's
swim team will go into the Big
East tournament in a position it is
rarely accustomed to: the
underdog.

For the first time in the history
of this tournament, the Lady
Panthers are not considered the
favorite. Villanova, fresh from its

' defeat of Pitt two weeks ago, is

now given that honor.

. “We are not the favorites  in
the sense that Villanova beat us
two weeks ago in a dual meet
very handily,” said head coach
Dave Belowich. “And that's a
positionthat the team hasn't been
in for a while.”

In that meet two weeks ago,
the team encountered more than

just the Lady Wildcats. The team
was on the end of a grueling
month in January which began
with heaVY practices to prepare
for tough competition from Penn
State and West Virginia. Also, the
flu bug had hit a few swimmers,
and the team found itself short-
handed and on the short end of
the score.

“We had trained so hard in the

month of January — harder than
perhaps any other team I’ve
coached,” said Belowich. “And
that can take its toll. [The
swimmers] were tired."
Villanova comes into this year

with a strong blend of talent and
experience. But Villanova’s
strongest swimmer is freshman
sensation Lisa Flood, who has
already broken the school record
in the 100- and 200—yard
breaststroke.

But Villanova doesn’t pose the
only threat to the Big East crown.
Syracuse is again one of the
stronger teams, with last year’s
winner in the 100-yard freestyle,
Lisa Bock, spearheading the
Syracuse attack. Also, Boston
College has another quality group;
its best events are distance.
