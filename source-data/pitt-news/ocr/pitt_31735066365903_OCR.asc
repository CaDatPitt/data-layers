Kuhlman’s flock gets amazing grace

Inﬁrm believers °

byDAVEBLUEY

Cripples in wheelchairs and braces, cancer victims struggling to
keep upright, heart disease patients gasping for breath and me, with
one very sore, infected thumb, stood in a line stretching for blocks,
waiting to attend the Kathryn Kuhlman Miracle Service. This was the
scene on Good Friday when the infirm flocked from such far off places
as Canada and Washington, D. C., to be miraculously cured by a petite,

outspoken evangelistwho contends that she can cure through her faith
 in God. -

Once inside the Mosque the worshippers hobbled to their seats to
pause in anxious anticipation, awaiting their beloved healer. Sudden-
ly a hush fell over the congregation as Kuhlman appeared in all her
glory, bedecked in a bedazzling gown and hairstyle dating back to the
20’s. '

An “I belie-e-e-e-eve in-n-n miracles,” escaped her lips as the

awestruck crowd shivered, expecting miracles from heaven at any
second. - ..

Words oozed from Kuhlman for over an hour, as she attempted to

, raise the souls of her multitude from darkness and let them see a light

other than that focused on her from the projection booth on the top
balcony.

At long last Kuhlman floated down in_to the audience to touch a few

I, of the tired but faithful with her hand, chanting phrases of adora-

tion over the heads of the audience and convincing them that they were
cured of the maladies previously inflicting them.

The “chosen ones” then praised God (and Kuhlmaiil, an effect «in--
tensifying the hypnotic trance which had spread over the congregation.

One particular “cure” involved a man who accompanied me; he
was partially deaf due to diabetes. Kulhman placed her hand on his

, ear exclaiming that he was cured and no longer needed the artificial
H. hearing device. He tore the hearing aid from his ear and proclaimed to

the multitude that his hearing was restored.
I saw my friend the next day and his hearing aid was restored.

Kuhlman, who serves as president of the Kathryn Kuhlman Foun-
dation and operates a complete radio station and a weekly television

show, entitled I Believe in Miracles (the title of her best selling book), .-

is certainly a person with great personal magnetism.

At the end of her service people were attracted to her in hopes of
touching her frail body to obtain some of the wonderful gifts which
seem to be channeled through this living legend. '

The crowd reluctantly dispersed after Kuhlman’s exit. Many re-

turned to their homes healed, rejoicing in their luck.

Unfortunately, many remained in the same miserable condition as
before; possibly their conditions worsened after the hardships they
suffered in making the trip to the service.

Incidentally, when I left the ‘service my thumb was still swollen
and infected, possibly because of my lack of faith—-not in Godtbut in
Kuhlman. I r

   

ROTC cadets have accused‘Faculty of

berg of violating the Faculty of Arts and
Sciences Council by-laws in an alleged at-
tempt to subvert efforts to reinstate ROTC
credit.

According to Don Fingeret, an Air Force
ROTC cadet, Rosenberg stated that 40 sig-
natures on a petition were necessary to
have an item placed upon the agendagof the
Faculty of Arts and Sciences Council
(FASC) meeting.

After securing the necessary signatures,
according to Fingeret, the question of
ROTC credit was not placed upon the agen-
da, but instead referred to a committee for
study. ’

In their petition, the cadets asked that
the  . . the Dean of the Faculty of Arts
and Sciences redetermine the issue of ap-
propriate credit for ROTC programs.”

 . “In addition to placing the matter_on
{the agenda fordiscussion at the ‘Spring
émeeting of the Faculty of Arts and Sci-

ROTC courses.

  

ences, we petition for a mail referendum to
all members of the faculty to be conduct-
ed prior to the fall term. The referendum
should spe/cifically stipulate whether full
credit should or should not be, awarded

“The FASC defeated (by .a vote of 2-6)
a proposal to place on the agenda of the
April 8 meeting a motion calling for a ref-
erendum on the ROTC issue,” according to
the minutes of the FASC meeting of Jan. 22.

The minutes also stated, “FASC voted-
eight to one to place the following motion
on the agenda of the April 8 FAS meet-
ing: the Dean of FAS is requested to ap-
point a committee to consider the award-
ing of academic credit for ROTC courses.
This committee shall report its recom-
mendations to FAS by February, 1973.”

Fingeret termed this “a complete turn-
around” and claimed that Rosenberg had
lost his credibility by failing to comply
with a FASC by-law which states, “Items
may be placed; upon the -agenda of regular

healed’

LAC offers students

advice, moral support
byTOM HEIPLE B

After his arrest, a scared student enters the arraignment room in
the Public Safety Building in downtown Pittsburgh. ‘ 

It is easy to stereotype such a room: dusty lights, dirty, cocoa-col-
ored walls, square-backed wooden chairs, and backless benches. Sit-
ting behind a desk at the front of the room is a scowling old man,

straight out of an old gangster flick.

Fortunately such scenes no longer exist.
But whilethe background may change, the actors never do.
The magistrate tells the student the_charge, how much his bond is,

_ and the time and date of his preliminary hearing.

A student can put up bond or go to jail.

While the Legal Awareness Committee (LAC) at the University
may not be composed of knights in shining armor, it has proven very
effective in providing moral support, food, and legal advice for arrest-
ed students. ' i '

“What the committee does,” explained Chairman Jeff‘Pasek, “is
go to the arraignment on behalf of the student and explain why we feel
thecourt should trust the student with a nominal (one dollar) bond.

“We’ve gotten almost all students nominal bonds and they’ve all
showed up,” Pasek continued. “The students are more reliable than
the courts thought students to be.”

After being released, the student, if involved inga court case, is '

referred to an attorney-—skilled in an area suitable to his needs.

But a student doesn’t have to be arrested to take advantage of
LAC’s services. f

“If a student has a legal problem, he can talkto our attorney
without cost,” Pasek noted. “Legal information, counselling, and let-
ter writing are free to students. . ‘

Dean Rosenberg reported that the FASC

FASC was, he said, “Trying to wrestle

WHB presidency

“We are pushing for speakers and -

movies right in the resident halls.

Such an arrangement would at-_ I

tract more participation from
dorm students,” she said. Though
Krafsig noted that a revision of
the Allocations Committee would
be necessary to carry out this

-plan, she was optimistic concern-

ing favorable acceptance of the‘
innovation.

‘ Krafsig argued that present se-A’.

curity regulations should be more
rigidly enforced until a new sys-

tem can be developed. In Tower C,',, I

she contended,’ the guards leis-
urely patrol the halls, often stop-.

ping in certain rooms to engage, it
in social chats. Krafsig sees a 

need to eliminate this loose prac-'
tice. “These police are not doing
their jobs and it is the student

ed.

Krafsig also criticized thelfood , 

service. “The problem lies in the
fact that Pitt has only one food

service. Most colleges have more. ‘ _
than one.” But on the whole, she " I
disagrees with the degrading pub-L I

licity accorded Szabo. “It is im-
possible to cook such huge quan-

tities of food and expect it to‘

lease ever one,” she said.

On the subject of Resident As-, é_"_’,j

The Pennsylvania Primary takes place April 25. In the first of a
 two part ballot, voters will elect delegates. The second item allows
voters to express presidential preference within their parties.

The Republican Primary will hold no surprises as Nixon is as-
.  vsured of renomination, but the Democratic contest should be an impor-
’ tant race for McGovern, Muskie, Humphrey, Wallace, and Chisholm.

, _ However, a great many Pitt students registered at their school
’ 5 residence will be home on spring break by April 18. If these students
cannot return on April 25 to the 43rd District (Where, they are registered)
and have not obtained absentee ballots, they will lose their vote.

Since the procedure takes two weeks, a student planning to vote by
 absentee ballot must begin the process immediately. The steps to be
I completed include: '

_ 1-) Sending in the request card for an official application form;
2) Sending back the application for an official absentee ballot;
3) Returning the absentee ballot by April 21.

STUDENT GOVERNMENT approved the goals of the‘Public Interest Re- T

search Group, but suggested Cl check-off system as a funding mechanism.

S G. approves PIRG,

suggests. check-off

. by JAMIE KIRKWOOD
Last week the Student Government Board unanimously accepted

the motion of President Tom Bailey reflecting SG‘s support of a check
off system as a funding mechanism for PIRG.

The statement read as follows:

“We, the Student Government Board would like to express our stand
on the issue of the Public Research Interest Group. We wholehearted-
ly back PIRG’s function and ideals and would like to see students fund
such an organization. The mechanism we choose would be . . . a separ-
ate check-off card which would be included in the invoice packet. The
decision wouldbe yes we support or not we do not support the PIRG
issue. Also included in the invoice packet would be a page of informa-
tion, both front and back explaining PIRG’s objectives, and a _separ-
ate en-velope that would be used to send the $2 fee to the organization.”

In new business the Board received and rejected a proposal from
Bob Reese. a Young Socialist representative, for Student Government
to run mock elections to compare the difference in results on that bal-
lot with the primaries and the results in November.

The proposal. called "Choice ‘72," is a similar referendum to
"Choice ’68." the mock election of the last national election year.

Some of the considerations were to include unconditional with-
drawal, complete amnesty and unrestricted abortion.

The proposed “voting” days were to have been April 6 and 7.

While Board members were inlgeneral agreementito the referen-
dum. President Bailey summarized for all, saying: ~

“There are too many things involving us right now. I just don’t

* feel we could do it with the time element involved and what has to be

done?’

Board member Terri Weaver then suggested Reese "bring it back
to us this summer and we can really do a good job for‘September.“

Continuing in their Allocations Committee proposals. the Board
approved the recommended $210.20 to Gamma Theta Upsilon. the
geography fraternity. for guest speakers. two trips at 10 cents a mile
for one vehicle, and office supplies. ‘

They also approved $131 to the Amateur Radio Club.

A dispute arose in the funding of the Pitt International Student Or-
ganization over a $300 personal effects item. but once it was stricken
from the proposed amount the Board approved a $91 allocation to the
organization for undergraduate travel.

The Board also approved _the allocations recommendation of $2.-
500 to the Black Action Society to try to bring to campus Carl Stokes.
former mayor of Cleveland. ' ‘

Somebody Nailed Down
  The Truth About Pitt's,
R0£ld Racing Team! is

Do you realize that because of the Road Racing Team, mg
ﬂEiT_OF_l.1§ here at school will be forced to pay a fraction of the
usual cost to travel to places like Georgia, New York, New
Hampshire, and Wisconsin on a race weekend ? And once we
get there, we’ll have to’ come up with$l.OOANIGHTfor. merely
staying in some new college dormitory ! And then, we’ll prac-
tically,HAVE NO CHOICEexcept to pay the special half price ad-
mission to some of the most famous race tracks in the country!

. These and other things .have been going on .for a long
time, but no one has ever suspected anything until now!

Recently, the Road Racing Team went out and had a gi-\
gantic new service station given to them, and then turned right
around and stuck SEVERAL OF US working there for the WHOLE

 

_ summer at almost $3.00 an hour! »

And we’ve just discovered that they’ve made arrangements
with (_I_ELT_A_Lr_\l_big‘ corporation friends of theirs, and from now
on _V_l/§_\1V_I_l_.L_.z1l._l; be charged considerably less for television sets,
stereos, cameras,/magazine subscriptions, ‘car parts and a lot
of other stuff! . '

I

At this "very moment, they’re holding‘ meetings behind
CLOSED DOORS whereonly GIRLS are admitted, and. they say
it’s to teach them how to change a flat tire or to avoid being
overcharged for auto repairs. A likely story!

 

YOU kI10W} there 81' 9 always SOME people who carry things.
a little TOO.far, and what the Road Racing Team hasldonle by
spreading OUR university’S name all over America on radio and
television, can definitely be considered as going PRETTY far)

.1’

The time has come for the students on this campus to unite,
to stop talking and start doing something about these things!

"In this case, it’s rather obvious that there’s only one SENSIBLE

thing for all of us _T_Q do!

WE BETTER JOIN THE ROAD RACING TEAM II! If
one single student organization can offer us all these advan-
tages, maybe as members we can see what we can do about
GETTING ANOTHER ONE just like it!

 » An old political theorem states that as the Republican Party is’
"composed of upper class and business interests, the Democratic
‘Party is the party of the people, the middle to lower classes. .

Nowhere is this more evident than in the unions‘ traditional
3 support of the Democrats. And if the rank and file occasionally
I stray‘ into the Republican fold, no matter, for there has never
been any doubt about the union executive. ‘

confrontation is imminent between union leadership and the man

President Nixon. '

 ‘Take George Meany, implacably opposed to Richard Nixon Re-

 As president of the.AFL-CIO, Meany is foremost among the

‘of such boards of large wage increases to “make-up" inflation

Simon praised
Editor:

I am grateful for Michael Si-
mon's article of March 22. en-
titled "Nixon’s Welfare Reform—
a step backward" for revealing
the purposes and consequences
of the .Family Assistance Plan.
Bill No. 1. But is‘ he also
aware that a very similar law.
has already passed concerning
people who -receive only food
stamps. and not welfare'?,- ’

I have been receiving food
stamps since last October and
had planned to continue receiv-
ing ‘them until my graduation
this spring. But I have been de-
clared ineligible. '

Every three months the recipi-
ent has an interview with a
representative of the Department
of Welfare in order to determine
the recipient’s re-eligibility for
the next three month period. Upon
attending that interview last
week my roommate and I were

.upset_ to discover that we were

no longer eligible. The new law

‘ has stiffened and placed further

restrictions upon which people
are qualifiedto receivethis aid.
We ' were disqualified because
we are two unrelated individuals
sharing the same household.

The woman who interviewed
us readily admitted that the
new food stamp law discrimin-
ates against students (as does
FAP: ‘H-1) as they are the
group most likely to be unrelat-
ed‘and sharing one household.
It would seem that under the
new "reforms" eligibility for
bothvfood stamps and welfare
is no longer based on financial
need, but, instead, is based on
whether _or not the legislators
like your life style. I would
like to urge students and others

Greensburg slandered

Dear Sir: , _
"We are tired of being looked
upon ‘as inferior because of our

Pitt at Greensburg background. ‘

The branch ‘campuses’ have been
referred to as "Junior C-Col-

leges,” "High Schools” and other
such degrading terms. Why does ‘

the‘ University harbor. regional
campuses. if they are supposedly
"inferior?” We have found Pitt
at Greensburg to be much more
difficult and challenging‘ than
the Oakland campus. Pitt at
Greensburg is an educational
institution made up teachers who
stimulate learning above and

beyond the call of duty. The

classes at Pitt at Greensburg are
smaller which allows teachers
«more time -to interact with‘ their
students and thus, evaluate per-
formance better.

The Q.P.A.’s' of the students
from Pitt at Greensburg usually
fall the first term here. The rea-
sons are obvious. A different
atmosphere, larger classes, the
adjustment of living away from
home and the tedious hours of
commuting are only a few of the
numerous causes of Q.P.A. drops.

We wish that people would
take notice and accept the
branch campuses for the valuable

institu.tions' that they are and not"

Unfair coverage

Dear Editor. .
I would like to thank you and

your staff for your fine cover-

age of the recent Greek Week.

Activities. At a time when many
people are questioning the rele-
vance of the fraternity-sorority

system, you are allowing your

paper to become a vehicle for

' the opponents of this system by

printing cartoons which wrongly
stereotype members of frater-
nities. yet say nothing about
the fact» that fraternities contri-
bute immensly to the social life

' here at Pitt.

Many people say its fine" to

have parties and such, but that‘s ’

all the fraternities do. Let me
say this of any and all organi-
zations on this campus. . .when
was the last time you gave-blood
for charity? When was theilast
time you stood on a cold street
corner collectingbfor Children's
Hospital? These are._ major
events of Greek Week. and if
anyone is interested the Greeks
collected a total of $12,134.82
for charities like Children’s Hos-
pital and Muscular Dystrophy,
and gave 332 pints of blood.-

I realize that you are a new
staff, but don’t "let yourself fall
into the, same biased habits as
the old staff. Print both sides of
all issues, and if you don’t have
any constructive criticism don’t
try to play the _ role of the
muckraker. '

Rude critic:
Editor:

I take issue with Dean Siegal"s
review, "Silver ‘Showing Lacks
Imaginative Inspiration” (Pitt

News , March 27), because it

gives me the impression that an
interesting exhibit has suffered
at the hands or a critic‘ who
simply doesn’t know what he’s
talking about.

He starts by mistitling Silver’s
of the Crucifixion"
collage and maintains this tone

of negligence and incompetence’

throughout the remainder of the

‘ article) For instance, two "fine

works” that Siegal at first prais-
es highly.—the collage mentioned
above and “Small Audience”-
have by the end of his review
degenerated into pieces that

“partially portray ‘some semb-
lance of talent.“ Why the change?-

Apparently’ because his predilec-
tion for insult wins out over
his critical faculties.

He might be interested to
learn that lithography and air-

brush are techniques, not media. '

Siegal might also like to ex-
plain’ why he improperly refers
to the media rather than the fin-
ished products as “abstract and
semi-objective.” _ .

1 Most damning‘ of all, be over-
looks the basic premise of criti-
cism: that the reviewer should
consider the artist’s work within
the context of what the artist is
trying to accomplish. That is,
first determine what problem is
being confronted and then deter-
mine why the work does or does
not confront it successfully.

Siegal, fails, perhaps under-
standably. The “exhibit is ques-
tion demands a great deal of the

His appalling observation
that Silver’s “talent for drawing
is doubtful” is the sort of sweep-
ing statement that could be ap-
plied to every artist working with
abstraction, from Picasso to a
school child; and it further evin-
ces Siegal’s lack of background.
It is the trenchant observation
of a critic who would pan War
and Peace’ because it fails as a
short story.

Doni Silver’s work will have
to stand on its own. of course. I
urge everybody to see the exhib-
it at the Lutheran University

Strange encounter
Dear Sir:

I am writing this letter as a
warning’ to all of those who‘
have not yet been exposed to
the goings on‘ in some of our
men‘s bathrooms in Pitt’s Cath-
edral.

Two days ago, after attend-
ing a 2 p.m. class_ in the third
floor of the Cathedral, nature
drew me to the men’s room;
upon entering I, was greeted by
a friendly door man with “Hello.”
"hello,” I\
proceeded on with my‘ cause.

ofa*

Hearing ecstatic moaning. my ,

eyes were drawn to a semi-’open-
ed door with two pairs of feet in
reverse position. Nature contin-
ued to call me and I approach-
ed the closest urinal, minding my
own business. ’

After a few seconds, I turned

‘to a. touch; to my surprise, my

friendly doorman was standing

behind me with. a certain part-,_

of his anatomy gripped in

one hand while busily groping_

at me with his free hand.

I pushed him away, and with-
out finishing my original task. I
left the bathroom with one thought
in mind: if one ever felt the
need to use the 'Cathedral’s
men’s facilities, one should

either be willing to participate

in the goings on or wait until’
he gets home.

I wonder why the University’s I

police do not do "anything to
stop this conduct! Couldit pos-
sibly be that there are well
known personalities who fre-
quent these “pleasure houses?"

American tourist’s

by VIRGINIA COOK

He was probably an Omaha
banker—49ish, balding, and com-
fortably wrapped in a London Fog
raincoat, the kind Albert From-
mer would tell you to bring in Eur-
ope on Five Dollars a Day. I
overheard him lament, as he
plopped down on a long red velvet
stool in the Louvre: “I wish I
could appreciate this, I really do,
but I just can’t.” His wife was
probably lost in the crowd‘ of tour-
ists following a guide who was
preparing them for the wonders of
the Mona Lisa. His wife would
have a lot to tell her bridge club.

He would probably have a lot ofi,
s corns and callouses.

It was the first time in two-and-
one-half months that I had seen an
American who was not a student

: or professor—a real, live, taking-
the-tour-bus American tourist. It

was also the first time I realized,
that, if not becoming a little more
French, I was becoming a little
less American. When I asked a

, guard for directions, he explained

them to me in French, and when I
walked through the fabulous col-

lections of Delacroix, I understood -1

his use of red, his sense of line
‘and balance because we had talk-

ed about it so much in my course-

on French Art. While I- couldn’t
deny I was a tourist in Paris, I
had to admit I was a hybrid tour-
ist. '

H I hadn’t taken a suitcase to Par-
is, but I probably couldn’t have fit

‘all my first -impressions into it

anyway: amazement at how«effi-
cient and cheap the metros are
(one ride to any point in the sys-
tem is 15‘_cents) . . . the Parisian
bums, who sleep over the warm
sewer holes by night and sit on
them to heckle and beg during the
day . . . the Italian restaurant

Ft,
l

(where I tried my first snails.
They’re really quite delicious, as
long as you don’t think about the
little critters who mosey along
. ; .) where the people to my right
were speaking English (not Amer-
ican), and the people to their right
were speaking Japanese . . . the
Tunisian pastry shops that are
open ’til midnight . . . the open
air market _in the street near my
hotel in the Latin Quarter, where
the rabbits in the butcher shop

hadn’t been skinned yet . . . the '

Jardins de Luxembourg, where
French children were sailing their
boats inthe cement -pond in front
of the French Senate . . . and the
delicious patisserie, that was
nearly twice as expensive as in
Rouen.

I spent about the same amount
of time in Paris as in New York.
Whereas one taste of the Ameri-
can monster city in the sky is
enough, my first taste of Paris

was only an entree. Paris is, first

and foremost, a beautiful city:

"wide avenues, impressive monu-

ments, the parks (more diverse
and more: imaginatively located
than Central Park), and every-
where, the cafes. There, people
still take a little time to stop, eat,
drink, and relax. The city is di-
vided into .16 arrondisments, or
districts, and many maintain
their own particular atmosphere
or flavor; for example, the fifth
and sixth are the student-artist-
intellectual secions, the second is
more business, theater oriented
while the 16th is moreresidential.
Paris also seemed tobe amore
international city. While I _was in
New York, I heard only English
and Spanish, but in Paris. it was

-French, English, American, Ger-

man, Japanese, Russian, and even
Arabic.

ilnterctstlttt 'al House

faces   uncertai~t1 fttture

The Intercultural House is facing an uncertain lutureuwltile the
University decides whether or not to take an increased administrative
role in the interracial living project. —

The Intercultural House has been funded in the past by the Get-
trude Stein Foundation. with the Univetjsity providing tuition schol-
arships. ’ 6

Recently the foundation found itself unable to maintain the bulk of
the financial burden and a greater University administrative role was
sought.

After two meetings. according to John Tyler. founder of the House.

the two parties have reached a stalemate.

Tyler stated that there have been misunderstandings on the part of
the University regarding the goals of the Intercultural House. ’

He explained that the University views the project as a housing ar-

. 'rangeme'n't'rather than a ‘program with concrete objectives and over-
’  allgoals.

"The prime focus of the project is on the American problem of in-
tercultural understanding.” 'l‘yler explained. He said the project hopes
to foster “mutual understanding across racial barriers." ‘

"It‘s not ‘an integration thing. We have attempted to avoid the as-

similation concept." he said. Tyler went on to explain that. in the Housef
two groups of students. one black and one white. live together on an'_

equal basis. _ . ,

“Interracial living occurs frequently in dorms, apartments, etc.,’?
he said, “but here two groups live together, and groups behave differ-
ently than individuals.” '

The University. according to Tyler. wants to withdraw the schol-
arships. granting house members awards through the financial aid.ol-"-

fice on the basis of need. offering the House no other support.

Even though it is the end of the term and everyone is
making summer plans, it is necessary to discuss Homecoming
1972. Many people have voiced opinions on the way Home-
coming has been presented in the last few years. However, when
aapplications were made available student interest to decline. It
is the desire of the present committee to return to a traditional

Committee. Therefore, we encourage all concerned students to
apply for one of these positions. In short, the success or failure

combined efforts we can make this Homecoming a memorable
one. For further information, contact the Student Government

Squirrel Hill Theater . isnot your
type of film. Probably one of the
most mature and realistic musi-
cals ever to b.e filmed. Cabaret
plunges the Hollywood musical
into _a new dimension. Until now.
musicals have -lacked realism.
Even West Side Story reduced the
seriousness of gang fights to ad-
mittedly spectacular. yet unreal-

istic choreoigraphed routines. _
Cabaret, on the other hand.
brings the ugly truths of reality
into a musical. Director Bob-
Fosse has created a very good pic-

'ture_of pre-Nazi Germany. [sing

the cabaret._ Kit Kat Klub. as an

. analogy ofthe German, society_ in
A the early thirties. Fosse conveys

avmood of decadence disguised by
happiness and gaiéty.

The MC._(Joel Grey), enticingly
evil, beckons the audience to en-
ter the cabaret and forget all their
troubles. He places a facade of
respectability ' around the Klub,
but like the world outside, it is ac-
tually filthy and despicable."

The girls -in the band are not
beautiful as advertised. but rather
are fat. vulgar whores. Out on the
street.»while the entertainers sing
and dance. the Nazi Party waits
patiently for its turn to "enter-
tain" the German people. “Life is
a cabaret." all right. and Fosse
depicts its decadence brilliantly.

Sally Bowles is a personifica-
tion of naivete toward the immor-
al German society. From her

heavily made-up face to her hor- _

rendous green fingernail polish.
she is a product of Germany‘s
‘‘divinedecadence.‘‘,‘ : '_ . -
Sally clings to theibelief that
someday she will become 'a‘l fai-
mous movie star. However, just
as Germany’s ideal society will

gray spark la [/4 Kaaarat

never materialize, neither will
SalIy’s dream. When she finally
reaches a decent level of exis-
tence, she denies herself that sat-
isfaction, continuing her hopeless
search. i ‘

Liza Minnelli is dazzling as the
exhuberant yet vulnerable Sally.
Cabaret serves as a perfect show-
case of all her talents. Not only
does she once again clown across
the screen.. as she did so we_ll in
The Sterile Cuckoo, but also
shows us her excellent song-and
dance abilities.

While all of his lines were part
of song lyrics. Joel Grey creates
a deliciously threatening charac-

ter ,out of the master of cere-.
monies. His slicked-down hair and ,

yellowing teeth add to his menac-
ing face. co_ntinu_irtg the morose
mood of the film. ' .

Under Fosse’s -direction, Cab-
aret-has been transformed from a
drab and uninspired Broadway
musical to a sordid drama inter-
spersed with songs and political
overtones. The fast paced cine-V
matography adds immeasurably to
the somber mood.

Perhaps the most poignant scene

in Cabaret is that of the baby—‘

faced young man singing a beauti-
ful rendition of “Tomorrow Be-
longs to Me." As -the camera
moves back we notice that he is a
member of the Nazi Party. What
at first seems a tranquil sight be-
comes a very threatening com-
ment on German society. As other
young girls and boys join the
young Nazi. Fosse pans ironically

to the bewildered expressions on
i_the faces of the old men of the
village. ‘In this single scene. Cab-
‘ aret clearly conveys its message.

,Of course. Fosse's direction

‘does at times appear awkward
-and emba‘rras‘sing.

I found the
cabaret scene about interfaith
marriages trite and unnecessary_.
But. on the whole. he should be

commended on his mature ap-
proach to this musical. Fosse has
produced a movie that is a social
commentary first and a musical
second.

 A ‘Passion’   quickens heart E

by ANDREW J. SOPKO
_ Arts Editor

Bachs Passion According to Saint Matthew,
certainly one of the most moving works from the

A entire" repertoire. received its traditional perform- .

ance by the Pittsburgh Oratorio Society last week
with ‘many commendable results. To say the very
least.-a convincing performance of this work is no

‘small task and in spite of the usual quirks. Don

Wilkins’ kept things running smoothly via his very
capableconducting. ‘

The Passion itself is by no means unfamiliar to
theoOratorio Society. e.specially when one realizes
that theoorganization has performedit at least six

times in the la-st 11 years. Such a familiarity with ,

the work definitely improves chances for a fai_rly
decent performance. and while I have heard the
Passion done by this group only three times. there
was-certainly a marked improvement with each
succeeding performance. ‘ —

Both chorally and orchestrally, this latest per-

formance was quite satisfactory. The chorus was

especially responsive to Wilkins’ feeling for the '

work. Double choruses came off quite well, es-
pecially the opening chorus (despite a wavering boy
choir). In addition.to the choir’s chorales, the con-
gregation received the opportunity to join in singing
three of the chorales, thus-providinga more mean-
ingful experiencefor the listener.

For the greater part. the solo weakened rather
than strengthened the artistic strivings of the chor-
us. Tenor David Evans was quite an upsetting ‘
Evangelist. fishing for notes and pouhcing upon ev-
ery note calling for a more dramatic quality. His

wsve.tm=. RAt5liO..STATtON is

excessive vibrato and constant bellowing detract-
ed immensely from his delivery.

True to his role as Jesus. Jerry Shannon. bass.
provided redemption. at least so far as the soil

were concerned. His voice not only remained reson— '

ant throughout but showed no trace of darkening in
the lower register...Thomas Dean filled out the re-
maining bass roles while Miriam Kelly and Eliza-
beth Youngue provided the soprano and contralto
arias. What a culprit the diction problem can be.
especially when considered irnthe context provided
by these last two soloists. Even when looking at the
text. I very often had to leave to my imagination
what was being sung. . _ \
Dramatically,-the work very definitely had its
moments: the binding of Jesus, the cry for Barab-

‘has, and the rending of the veil of the temple all

came across with .a drama reaching the boiling
point. Unfortunately, however, the overall per-
formance lacked dramatic continuity. Great gaps of
silence broke the “spell” of_the music as‘ Wilkins
took much too much time to speak with his musi-
cians between numbers.

Despite all this. a fairly competent choral,

awareness of how this work was to be approached
overcame most of the underlying problems. The
glory of it all was still there. even when problems
were apparent. As one of the most prolific of these
rare artistic works transcending time itself. the
Passion stands as a testimony to a powerful mess-
age. With its most recent performance. the Oratorio
Society has proven that it can very definitely con-
vey that powerful messagein a way speaking not
only to the mind but to the heart as well.

The Pitt mitters, 18-8 last year.
open up their ’72 season against
city rivals Duquesne Dukes this
afternoon at 3 p.m. at the All-
Purpose Field behind Trees Hall.

The baseball season was ori-
ginally slated to begin here on
Monday in a contest with the
West Virginia Mountaineers, but
due to poor field conditions caus-
ed by an‘ unexpected snowfall.
the game was rescheduled for
April 17th. I ‘

Sports Editor ’

There is at least one area that

the Panther football team will be »

solid when the fallcampaign gets
underway. With both _front lin-
ers and more than adequate depth
returning, the offensive backfield
will supply’the hopes for a suc-
cessful year.

In fact, when head football

coach Carl DePasqua and his
staff sat down, a month before

spring drills became‘ a reality,

‘ to plan grid changes, it was the
offensive backfield which trig-
gered the new look the Cats are
now sporting. 2 .

At that time, DePasqua decid-
ed that the wishbone‘ offense
would fit very nicely into the
Pitt picture. With no-less than 8
returning ball carriers and a pro-

ven freshmen squad, moving up, V

the intriguing formation began
its orientation 16 days ago.

_ This Saturday. afternoon, at the
completion of twenty practices,
the wishbone offense will be put
onldisplay in the annual Blue/

3 Gold game.

John Chatman, Bill Englert,
Paul Felinczak, Stan .O‘strowski,v
Clair -Wilson, and Bob Newton

I ; (John Mossand Lou Julian were
,. moved to defense) are the ex-

, perienced runners that‘ will be

\

 

trying to impress their mentors.”

But that’s not all. Dave Jan-
_asek, Bruce Murphy, Dan Smith,
Gary Normand, and Ed Brennan
will also be on hand as the grad-
uated freshmen core of runners.
Also, Lou Cecconi and Tim Horn-
ish were switched to offense to
even further strengthen the posi-
tion. ‘ l.

The very mention of the word
wishbone is enough to excite
knowledgable football fans. With
the success it has enjoyed else-
where it is no wonder that the
casual observers who stroll into

Pitt ‘Stadium end; up focusing
.their attention ‘, on the offensive:

   Mittei-s-Dukeis ans

playing dates with the Mounties,
who happen to be one of the
Panthers toughest rivals. “Finals
will be over when we play West
Virginia and the boys can do
better, they always play better
after finals. They’ll be able to
concentrate more on the game."

Going into today’s game, the
‘mitters have the advantage of hav-
ing spent one week‘ of spring-'
training on a southern tour in
Florida. During this time Lewis
was able to come up with the
answers to many of the key ques-
tions concerning his team’s po-
tential.

"The trip to Florida-was very
beneficial for the team," relayed

Lewis. “I tried to play every-

body. I knew if we tried to win
all the games while we were
down there we wouldn’t ac-
complish much. So what I tried

to do every day was get every-'

one to play.

"We wanted to play as much
as possible. If our pitching had
held out (many of the front line
pitchers suffered from sore arms
while in Florida) we could have
gone two games a day.

“All in all it was a very valu-
able experience,” continued Lew--
‘is. “We got an ‘idea of what
some guys can and cannot do.”

What the Pitt mentor was able
to discover while on the tour was
-who will fill the vacancies in
the outfield and at shortstop,

 

and how strong his pitching staff
looks for this season.

Lewis has decided to utilize
a platooning system with his out-
fielders. Harry Pardini will
play center field while the oth-
er two ‘positions will change
hands depending on whether the
opposing pitcher is a. right or a
left hander.

Dennis Toboz will occupy left
field and Scott Sufrin will play

- rightwhen opposing a right hand-

er. Ed Kelley and Len Raffa. will
man left and right, respectively,
when facing a lefty.

Sophomore Paul Seneca has
nailed down the Panther short-
stop position. “Paul canjmake the
plays, he has a strong arm,"
commented Lewis. “He’s short
but he can cover the position.
You can’t measure him on his
physical size. He gives 150 per
cent; Paul hussles and, because
of this, overcomes the physical

* handicap of his size.”
Although. many of the pitch-_,

ers were plagued by sore arms
during the trip. Lewis was still
very impressed" by their per-
formance. a

“I think our front-line pitch-
ing was good enough ‘that it
could have beaten the Pirate
Rookies every time. ,

“Mike Niccols and Albie Syl-
anski will be our number. one and‘
two pitchers this season. We’ll
need both of these guys —— we

 

urs change

play _a ‘lot of doubleheaders in
a row- and if Albie (who has’
been having arm trouble) doesn’t
come around, we’re liable to have
a problem.”

Niccols, who was 5-1 last year
with an ERA of 1.97, will be the
starting pitcher in the home op-
ener against Duquesne.

 

~ \

So when DePasqua learned
that Steve Moyer, Joel Klimek,

~ and Doug Ginden would not be

back this year, the move to, the
running game. seemed a logical
one.

For those who have visions of

Greg Pruitts and,'Joe Wylies run-

ning for Pitt next year, a more
down to earth outlook is safer.
“We've got good speed,” an-
nounced assistant coach -Paul
Kemp. .‘.‘0ur speed is notgreat,

:thefI‘I_fStg§iIm¢..”  ~ 2

we have some runners that aren't
that far behind.”

Right now, however, Kemp is
more’ concerned with learning" the
techniques than worrying about
-speed and comparisons.

“Learning is repetition,” con-
tinued Kemp. “Because we’ve had
so many injuries the unit has not
worked together well. Only Eng-
lert and Cecconi‘ have been able
to make all the practices.

“We’ve got good size, enough

- size. Ithink we will see the bene-,_ ‘

Whoever will carry the pig-
skin, the emphasis will be on suc-

cess. - » '

“Success .means winning a lot
of games — we wouldn’t be run-
ning the wishbone if we didn’t
think it would succeed,” said
Kemp. J

Every year coaches tend to be
very optomistic about upcoming
seasons. This is also true of the
Pitt coachingstaff.’ Maybe it’s
just jargon, but there .-is some un-

explainable hope attached with

' ————Co-captain Carosielli

The tracks

by JERRY MYERS
Although the average college athlete may take
one of many shapes and forms. the well—built. close
cropped. All-American boy image has stereotypical-
ly integrated itself into the national folklore. When
people think about athletes they rarely picture a Ina-

? ture. family man.

Rick Carosielli. one of the track team's two co-
captains. fits into the little cited framework. Mar-
ried and the proud father of a 26 month old son. the
senior trackster uses his experience and maturity
in both facets of his life.

"The freshmen feel that they can come to me."
commented_ the blond-haired hurdler as he lounged
on the sidelines of Pitt‘s football field. "Sometimes
I act as a link between the coach and the team.“

Carosielli became a co-caxptain when Dennis
Schatzman dropped off the squad’s roster, and ac-
cording to his coach and one-time roommate Smit-
tie Brown, “Rick is a really mature guy. Most of
the fellows look up to him.” I

But it takes more than maturity to start for a
major college track team and the Lancaster. Pa..
native has what it takes. Carosielli is regarded by
Brown as one of Pitt’s two top hurdlers. along with
Andre Harris. His best timein the 120 high hurdles
is 14.2 which was good enough to give him a first in
last years Pitt Invitational.

. "He and Harris are equals." commented
Brown. "They're both excellent hurdlers. But Rick
is not a sprinter. he doesn‘t have that quick start."

The lack of the opening burst of speed is the
reason why Carosielli prefers the outdoor season
where the 120 is run along with a new event, the
110 meter.

"1 don‘t have an explosive start." commented
the Conastoga High School grad. "I don't have the
sprinters speed. I started out the indoor season

 

  

SENIOR CO-CAPTAIN Rick Carosielli demonstrates frm'

with a 6.1. but haven’t equaled it since. This has
been a disappointing year."

But Carosielli is still looking. forward to the
outdoor season which will open with the Kentucky
Relays this Saturday.

“For the first time I’m running the 110 me-
ter. I’m looking forward to the meet,” the veteran
trackster indicated. “I know the hurdlers are ready
for it.”

 Besides trying to please his coach. Rick also
hasmthe job of keeping his wife happy.

“My wife gets mad when I go on two-day trips."
Carosielli commented. "When I come back all I
want to do is sit around the house. talk to her. or
watch television. It‘s hard.“

Then in June, Carosielli graduates with no def-
inite plans for the future. An urban studies major,
Rick talks about going into business for himself or
with his good friend Jerry Richey in a year or two.

But next year he plans to take it easy. and with
his present grind it's hard to blame him.

CMU in gopener win

by PAUL DEVITO

The Pitt Panther _golf team won
its first match of the season by
defeating Carnegie—Mellon yes-
terday. 14 to 4. The match was
played at the luxurious Longue
Vue CountryClub.

Played in unusually cold wea-
ther by golfing standards. the
Panthers easily overwhelmed the
weaker CMU squad by winning
five of the six possible matches.

The overall match was scored
not on the individual scores but
on a match ‘point system. In this
system each player plays against
his own opponent for a possible
3 point total. One point is award-
ed to the winner
nine. back nine. and final victor
of the match.

Rick Plonta’s 85 gave Pitt an
early 3 point lead as he easily
defeated opponent Dave Borko-
vich who ended with a 105. Dan
Stone of CMU defeated Pitt’s
Tim Christ 85-86. But, Christ and
Stone shared equally the amount
of points earned with each re-
ceiving 1‘/2 pts. -

In the second round. Panther
Mike Jones earned 212 points by
beating Jay Lavin 77-82. Then.
Ed Bullano of Pitt shot an 80 to
defeat John Billetdeauxs 83. thus
winning 3 points for the Panthers.

Seven days of fun and sun in
Florida (St. Petersburg and Brad-
enton) last week for the Pitt base-
ball team resulted in a 3-2-1 ex-
hibition record to prepare the mit-
ters for their season opener to-
day against Duquesne.

The Pittsburgh Pirate Rookie A
squad defeated Coach Bobby Lew-
is‘ diamondmen twice. 10-6 and
3-2. Unable to contain the Buc
farmhands on the basepaths. Pitt
still‘ managed to eke out a 3-2
triumph and a 5-5 tie with the
Bradenton rookies.

Outfielder Len Raffa led the
mitters’ hitting parade with six
hits. two each in the first and last
games. Shortstop Paul Seneca.
centerfielder Harry Pardini. third
sacker Danny Slain, and keyston-
er Rick Monroe rapped out four
safeties apiece.

With the mound corps decimated ,

by sore arms, Lewis’ hopes of
playing two contests each day
evaporated early. Nevertheless,
pitcher Mike Fedoris performed
brilliantly in his two starts.

After hurling three perfect inn-
ings against Binghamton, includ-
ing seven strikeouts, Fedoris was
forced to stay in bed for the next
.36 hours, having incurred a bad
case of sunburn. upset stomach.
and fever.

However. Fedoris recovered and
notched a 3-2 complete game vic-
tory over the Pirate A team. ex-
ercising pinpoint control through-
out the six inning contest.

The mitters’ most exciting vic-
tory was a 10-9 thriller over New
York University. Trailing 9-5 in
the last of the eighth, Pitt pushed
across five runs on three walks
and three singles, with Monroe’s
infield hit to deep short driving in
the winning tally.

Captain Ken Macha (1B) and
Seneca (SS) hammered the Violet
(NYU) moundsmen.
ters‘ homered in the first frame
and subsequently went three for
three.

Commenting on his squads per-
formance .in Florida. Lewis re-
marked, "We got some very val-
uable experience down there. Ev-
erybody got a chance to play and
our freshmen (Scot Sufrin. Joe

Groetch, Pete Martorelli, Milan I

Popovich.'Tom Miller. and Mon-
roe) did a real fine job."

The Amazing Randi escape artist.
He has escaped from city vaults

at Cabaret Monoccoi

in only 15 minutes.

The Amazing Randi
Will Be Sponsored by The Special Programs Office

  

The USA first heard of him 15 years ago, when he dangled
by his feet, wrapped in a strait-jacket, 150 feet over the
streets of New York in a major network telecast. Shortly
thereafter, the NBC Today Show had him sealed in an air-
tight coffin and submerged in a svvimming-pool. Hundreds

of thousands of viewers watched him establish a still-standing
record for survival in a sealed container —- on live TV!
