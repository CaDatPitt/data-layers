Booth Purchase May
Settle Ticket Dispute

by RON LOZOWSKI
A compromise has been reach-

”ed concerning the initiation of

ticket sales for events held at
David Lawrence and Benedum
Halls. ‘

A few weeks ago, Director of
Student Activities Bill Markus an-
nounéed that tickets for films and
other events in the above auditori-
ums would have to be purchased
in advance at the Student Union
Desk. In the past, students had
been admitted upon paying at the
door.

Leaders of sponsoring organiz-
ations complained that the pro-
posed measure would not only in-
convenience students, but curtail
ticket sales as well.

Last Thursday, Markus met
with the groups involved and
reached an agreeable arrange-
ment. “We are currently explor-
ing the possibility of purchasing”
a secondhand ticket booth,” he
said. Wheels would be added to
make the booth portable, so that
it might be moved to and from the
scene of the events.

V The booth would probably be
paid for with some percentage of
the profits, said Markus. He.also
mentioned the possibility of ob-
taining a booth from Forbes Field
at minimal cost. 

Markus explained the necessity
of the new arrangement, saying
that "the old procedure had occa-
sioned accusations and counter
accusations against everyone
from Pat O'Brien to Lenny'Klavon-
ic.” Students involved in collect-
ing were often accusedlof pocket-
ing some of the profits, he noted.

‘In addition, continued Markus,
the old method enabled many stu-
dents to gain admission free of
charge, “walking right on through
without paying.” This was unfair
to the remainder of the students,
Markus said.

Markus also pointed out that on I

a number of occasions the audi-
torium held crowds whose size
violated fire regulations. “What
would happen if there were a
fire?" he asked. Even if this were
not the case, neighboring theater
owners could very well resent the
sizable crowds attending films (to
the theater owners‘ loss) and
decide to report such violations,
if and when they occurred again,

I contended Markus.

“The vice squad might even
come down and clear the whole

know what goes on down there;
I’m not blind.”

Under the new procedure, said‘
Markus, only a limited number of

tickets would be sold and no one —

elsewould be admitted.

Still another advantage of the
ticket booth would be the preven-
tion of theft, he said. “Right now

there’s nothing to stop someone —

from coming around and running
off with the money," he argued.

“We reserve, the facilities for
the activities and if there is not
some sort of guarantee that safe-
guards will be present, the facil-
lties will not be reserved," stated
Markus. “Our major concerns
are with security and student
safety," he added.

Ticket sales will help insure the
keeping of accurate records.
pointed out Markus. “This is not
a high school key club affair; this
is the big time. when you have
thousands of dollars involved." he

said. ,

County Officials

Howl

Voter Re

PHILADELPHIA (AP)—Penn-
sylvania's 67 counties were order-
ed Monday to extend voter regis-
tration for college students for at

least seven more days for the

Nov. 2 election.

Commonwealth Secretary C.
Delores Tucker acted under her
executive powers, following the
rulings by Atty. Gen. J. Shane
Creamer and a federal judge in
Philadelphia.

There were immediate howls
from harassed county officials
that the ruling was unconstitution-
al. And some indicated they might
not comply until ordered by a
court

U.S. District Judge Alfred L.
Luongo, recognizing the possible
illegality of extending registra-
tions beyond Monday as provided
under law, extended registration
for college students living in
Northhampton and Philadelphia
counties only for one week.

But he directed that such reg-
istrations must be kept separate
until a three judge court can rule
on the constitutionality of vari-
ous sections of Pennsylvania’s

election code under which regis- .

tration -and residence regulations
are promulgated.

Ms. Tucker's directive, how-
ever, didn‘t provide for any separ-
ation.

The'whole thing erupted after
Creamer’s ruling last Friday that
college students could register
and vote in towns where they go
to school, even though their resi-
dence is only temporary.

It is estimated that there are

- 400,000 college students in Penn-

sylvania and most of these young

New Parking Eases.

Commuter Problems

The University has moved to
ease parking problems for com-
muter students who park at night
and commuters who drive motor-
cycles.

Beginning Sept. 20, students
may park, at the O'Hara Garage.
located on O'Hara St. opposite
Benedum Hall, from 5 to 11 p.m.

Monday through Friday for a fee’

of 50 cents.

Students must show their II‘
cards and write their ID ni.nih.;~. s
on parking slips given to them by
the garage attendant in order to
be permitted to park in the ga-
rage for the above rate and time
period.

Students entering the lot before
5 p.m. and leaving after 11 p.m.
must pay the regular garage rates
for the extra time parked.

The University has also approv-
ed the following areas for motor-
cycle parking:

—South Corner of D Parking Lot
(8-10 bikes) located near the
Stadium at the corner of Stadi-
um Drive and Terrace St.

-—Langley Hall Dock area (8-

10) bikes with entrance from"

Ruskin Ave. L

—Lawrence Hall overhang (45-50
bikes) blacktop area between
sidewalks and Lawrence Hall
on Pennant Place.

Schenley Hall Quadrangle (20-
25 bikes).

THE Student Association Com-
missioners and the Allocations
Committee will meet tomor-
row at 7:30 p.m. in the SU.
Ballroom to discuss structural
problems. All students are in-
vited to attend the meeting.

The Pitt News will sponsor
an informal workshop and or-
ientation session for students
interested in writing regularly
or occasionally for the paper.
The session will extend from I
to 4 p.m. Friday in the Pitt
News office, 413 SU.

men -and women do not live in the
areas where they are enrolled.

Some communities fear a take-
over by college students if the At-
torney General’s ruling is not
overturned. This is particularly
true of. State College, home of
Pennsylvania State University,
which has more than 25,000 stu-
dents on campus, 90 percent of
whom are transients.

State College at the May pri-
mary had 6,233 registered, 2-1

Missirtg Phones Stall

Dorm Communication,

Vandalism of phones in the Towers Dormitories has left many

students without telephone service.

For the most part, the damaged or missing phones are pay phones,
though some campus phones are also missing. Floors two, six, and 15
in Tower A and floors three, nine, 12, and 16 in Tower B have neither
phone.’ In all, 20 of 42 phones in Tower B and 16 of 36 phones in Tower
A have been stolen or destroyed. A number of phones have also disap-

peared from Tower C this term.

John Vrana, director of Housing, said that the missing phones are

' being reported, but thatthe effects of the recent strike at Bell Tele-_'.

phone employees and the added workload the company must handle

with many students orderingphones have stalled replacement of the‘ _~

missing phones.

’He’s Timed To Explode’

by CINDY MORGAN

Everyone feels’ sorry for the
college freshman, lamenting over
his adjustment problems in com-
bining a- social and academic life.
Doesn't anyone realize that it is
probably the upper classman who

_ has an even greater adjustment

to make?

The freshman is coaxed and
prodded and has four years to
make up his mind about what he
wants from life. He is oriented
and programmed and has a mil-
lion places to go if he needs as-
sistance.

It is not until he reaches those
last two years that he sees the re-
sults of the spindling and mutilat-
ing processes through which he
has just gone.

Certainly,‘ by now he has learn-
ed how to dodge red tape and beat
the system by cutting .as many
classes as possible without dam-
aging grades. But then he realizes
that he only has a short time left
before he will have to leave the
shelter of the University and go

_ to the outside world.

And as if some cord was drawn
too tightly, something violently
snaps. and with that comes the
realization of a long series of con-
fusing problems.

He struggles with three per-
sons: his old self, his new self and
the one he is fated to become. The
“self” in the middle looks back on
his old set of values and claims
another. And he sees a conflict be-

tween what society expects and
what he wants. He is damned no

matter which way he finally goes, _

and the chances of going back to
his original character are strong.

Even the major he so confident-
ly picked as a freshman doesn’t
fit his needs any longer..He would
rather just go out and write nov-
els. But then, that probably won‘t
make any money would it? He

couldn‘t afford the sports car of’

his dreams. (But thenthat sort

of thing isn’t supposed to matter.)

    

He struggles with registrars
and student aid and state scholar-
ships, and worries about all the
loans he must pay back. (Money
does matter when ‘you don't have
it.)

Bitterly, he buries himself in
courses that mean little or noth-
ing. Only a few professors and in-
structors manage to keep a last
dying bit of enthusiasm alive and
glowing. '

“I want to be out,” he screams.
“I want to do something with a
little meaning."

And to this, he opens a notebook
and scrawls down ,a quote from
some favorite philosopher as he
answers the roll call.

“This is what I am sacrificing
time and money for?” he asks.
“For what? To answer ‘present’
in. class. I did that in grade school.
They should just allow me to .pay
them the money and make ar-
rangements to have my diploma
mailed.”

Walls start closing in as the
last few terms dwindle. Friends
stop being friends, and a person
whom he loves very much doesn‘t
want to help anymore. Maybe she
is afraid, too?

Everyone is demanding that he
live up to his responsibilities. but
he wants to leave, even for just a
week. Maybe then he could see
things objectively.

He is timed to explode, and so
caught up in the confusion that he

’ can’t escape for even a minute.

He sees that many don’t make
it to graduation, and that others
are hiding behind exams and par-
ties or favorite spots in the li-
braries because they don’t want
to see what is happening to them.

Time is running out for them,
he knows. And though he can’t
stand the fear of waiting for the
day he must make his final deci-
sion, that is all he can do. Every-
one else is out helping the fresh-
man get started. No one will be
there to make sure he finishes.

Amid our University's changes, it is unrealistic to assurne,,th:a,:
campus organizations will not also change to adapt to new situations. N

This is precisely what fraternity organizations have been doing in
recent years, a trend which started in large urban universities such. as
Pitt. 1

In view of the needs of its members and prospective members,
fraternities have redefined the term “social” and have expanded their
services to meet these broader social needs. To combat the inheren
impersonality of a large university bureaucracy, fraternities offer!
small interpersonal interaction groups. - '  E

Fraternities offer an intimate communal living experience as"aii
alternative to stark and crowded dorm life. Fraternities are, groups,
which encourage their members to express, enjoy, and share human».
experiences which may otherwise be lost in the shuffle. w ’ -5%

At Pitt, the Greeks have long been involved in the process 

ing from progressive membership education programs to replace the
traditional pledge programs to extensive educational experiences in
leadership and planning. ’ 

Fraternities are among the few organizations which encourage
completely open inspection and investigation of their way of life. The
rush period this termbegan last Wednesday and will run until Sept. 22. 

During this period, all interested people are invited to visit the
various houses and talk frankly with the members about fraternity livf
ing. It is a time to investigate the Greek system and evaluate the serv-
ice that it offers. '

This term, the fraternities have reinstated a few regulations on so-
cial events in an attempt to establish better community relations and ;
also to allow a more informal atmosphere for discussion of the beneﬁts" "
of fraternities. ”’

Basically, the Greek system at Pitt is asking those outside of the.'—
system to forget what they know or think they know about fraternities ,
and- to see them as they really are. ' — '

KhrushcheV   Buried

MOSCOW (AP)—“There were few people who were indifferent to
him. There weremany who loved him. There were many wlv hated
him. But few could pass him by without looking his way.”

With those words spoken by his son, Nikita S. Khrushchev was
laid to rest on Monday in a simple grave at Novodevichy Cemetery
next to an old monastery in Moscow. About 300 mourners looked on.

Absent was the pomp that Khrushchev commanded during‘ his 11
years as premier of the Soviet Union and chief of its Communist party.

The man whose word was once law in the Kremlin was buried in

a wooden coffin and practically ignored by the men who toppled him '

from power seven years ago.

The only official acknowledgements of Khrushchev’s death on Sat-
urday were a one paragraph announcement on the front page of Mon-
day’s Pravda and a funeral wreath sent by the Communist Party Cen-
tral Committee and the Council of Ministers.

In his brief graveside eulogy Khrushchev’s son, Sergei, an engi-
neer, also told the mourners: “We will not speak of a great statesman.
I should not be the only one to evaluate the contribution—whatever it
was made by my father Nikita Sergeyevich. I have no right to do that.
This is being done by history.” . r

The widow, Nina Petrovna, wearing a gray coat and a black lace
shawl over her head sobbed softly as her son delivered his remarks
from a mound of earth beside the grave. Daughters Yelena, Rada and
Julia, also sobbing, tried to comfort Mrs. Khrushchev. ’

U.S. Matador Bullied 

SPAIN (AP)—American bullfighter John Fulton was arrested Sun-
day after he left his spectator seat and jumped into the bull ring here to
try to fight the fifth bull of the afternoon.

He was stopped immediately. Later, in a prepared statement, Ful-
ton said he did it because a drawing of his was used f'or decorating the
official poster for the corrida without his permission.

The 39 nine old painter-bullfighter from Philadelphia, _Pa., confirm-
ed as a full fledged matador in 1963. was released after about two hours.

WASHINGTON (AP)—.An Illinois chemist reported Sunday preli-
minary development of a simple, self-administered saliva test that
might help women» achieve reliable birth control without the use of the
pill or other artificial contraceptive methods.

Dr. Raymond 0. Foster. a /Ph.D., indicated the test might also
provide a reliable back-up to the rhythm method of contraception, the
only method sanctioned by the Roman Catholic Church, other than
complete continence.

Foster said the test employs a strip of chemically sensitive tape
which a woman can hold briefly in her mouth each day. It is intended to
predict the fertile period from one to five days in advance in a given
month.

He stressed that while preliminary results are very promising, ad-
ditional studies must be made before the value of the technique can be
fully assessed—and before approval of the Food and Drug Administra-
tion to market the tape can be secured.

In his report, co-authored by Dr. Albert B. Lorinez. a Los Gatos,
Calif., physician, Fos_ter said the test evolved from other new findings
that revealed:

——There’s a periodic variation in the level of a chemical enzyme found
in saliva which corresponds with different phases of a woman‘s
monthly menstrual cycle.

——The enzyme, known as alkaline phosphatase, usually exhibits sig-
nificantly higher levels during the few days preceding ovulation
than it does during the other days of the menstrual cycle.

Up until about two years ago, science had generally believed that
despite individual irregularities in menstrual cycles, eight out of 10
women could depend on the rhythm method to prevent unwanted preg-
nancies.

But in 1969 it was reported that only three out of 10 women could
depend on it.

Britain Bans Free Milk

LONDON (AP)—A group of seven year olds hide behind a school
wall and sip an illegal white substance—milk.

Scenes like this are being repeated at state schools across Britain
as the government faces a simmering revolt against a controversial
law that bans free milk.

The law cancelling a long-standing state handout of milk to school
children seven to 11 years old was supposed to go into effect Sept. 10.

More than 13,000 kids in the Welsh towns of Swansea and Methyr

Tydfil have been drinking free milk‘ illegally at mid-morning every day ‘

for the past week.

The British government, trying to cut spending. banned the free
milk to all children except those needing it for medical reasons.

The government hoped the move would trim its budget $21.6 mil-
lion a year;

A former mayor of Methyr Tydfil, Bryn Watkins, is unimpressed
by’ the government’s argument that many kids don’t need free milk
even on medical grounds. 4

“We know about poverty, malnutrition, rickets and TB‘ in this
town," he said, “and we will not countenance the erosion of the welfare
state.” . -

At Leeds and Birmingham schools, rebellious medical officers are
deliberately interpreting the medical exemption clause so liberally that
atone school 86 out of its 187 children were declared eligible.

At schools where only a few children now get free milk on medi- _

cal grounds, others steal the bottles from them and drink secretly.

Manchester and Salford school boards say they’ve found a loophole
in the law by adding a bit of coffee to the milk so they can no longer be
accused of‘ handing out free “whole milk.”

‘Another loophole being explored is substituting a milk-based pro-
duct such as yogurt. But one suggestion—to put a grain of rice in each
milk bottle and call it rice pudding—is given little chance of succeed-
mg. _
Nine of London’s 12 boroughs are making arrangements to exploit
other loopholes—a law which lets them spend certain amounts of money
on any “general community purpose” whether the national government
likes it or not. v

They say free milk comes under this heading.

Cracking down on the milk outlaws could give Prime Minister Ed-
ward Heath a headache. Opposition critics would be sure to claim he’s
taking milk out of the mouths of babes.

So far the government has taken no action to halt the milk rebellion.

  Squatters Face Eviction  

-' (AP)I‘he youthful squatters along the Delaware River where the fed-

eral government is planning to build a dam and 37-mile recreational
lake live in fear of the bulldozer.

The squatters, many of whom are artists, musicians, college pro-
fessors, mathematicians, secretaries and engineers, have lived there
for three years. They moved into houses vacated when the Army Corps
of Engineers bought them to make way for the controversial $259 mil-
lion Tocks Island Dan and Recreation Area.

They have set up an agrarian counter-culture, living on homegrown
vegetables, cooking on open fires or with wood-burning stoves, canning
their own food, baking their own bread and making their own wine.

The squatters have been. drifting for several years into the fertile
valley along the Delaware River that separates Pennsylvania from
New Jersey. Most come from New York. . '

Some had been leasing houses from the Corps ‘of Engineers,
but when their leases began expiring in November they officially be-
came squatters. » '

“It was really weird. People were just drawn here," said Uwe
Dramm, 21, a former missionary in Canada. “It was mystical. Once
they came here they loved it.” '

On Sept. Ii, federal marshals armed with a federal court order, »

made a pre-dawn raid in two bulldozers. They gave the squatters a lit-‘
tle time remove their belongs, then demolished eight homes, two barns
and a plastic tent. » '

A spokesman for the Corps of Engineers in Philadelphia said it
hopes to start construction of the dam in the spring. But it has called
a temporary halt to the bulldozing because of what one official called “a
very complex social situation." A Corps of Engineers official said a
review of policy probably would be made.

be held Friday at 8 :30 a.m. in the conference room of 1001 CL.

F rats Seek Rushees,

“Accurate Image’

by JOEL HORWITZ

FallFraternity Rush is current-
ly in progress wit.h the campuses’
16 houses offering the traditional
fare of mixers, parties and stag
events designed to recruit par-
ticipants into the Greek system.

Two significant changes have
been initiated in this year’s rush
procedures. The first change in-
volves the elimination of pre-
rush registration at the Inter-
fraternity Council smoker, thus
placing emphasis for contacting
rushees upon the individual
fraternities. The second change
is a ruling which forbids alco-
holic beverages at evening rush
functions.

Commenting on the import-
ance of Fall rush, Paul Symc-
zak, president of the Interfra-
ternity Council, stated, “The
fraternity system has definitely
changed and we must inform
people of these changes. Pre-
sently, there is no particular
need for further changes in
fraternity life, but we must con-
centrate on projecting an accur-
ate image. If we show a sincere
interest in rushees this interest
will be reciprocated.”

I Symczak also noted that
feedback from the various
houses indicates that more men
are interested in pledging fra-
ternities.

Jerry Katz, Master (President)
of Alpha Epsilon Pi Fraternity,
feels that the most successful
houses in rush will be “those
that can relate with rushees on
a one to one basis.” Katz views
this year’s rush changes as at-
tempts to decentralize the sys-
tem and create a more personal
rush atmosphere. He noted that
the “attitude of rushees toward
fraternities is swinging from
negativism toward a more posi-
tive viewpoint.”

. Although having a “dry”
rush has reduced the volume of
rushees, Katz noted an increase
in the number of persons who
are" sincerely interested and
expects his house to initiate a
pledge class which will be al-

  FORBES 5

most twice the size of last
Fall’s class.
Despite Greek efforts to com-
municate a new fraternity image,
a random sampling of Freshman
rushees indicates that old
fraternity stereotypes are still
in abundance. Comments from
freshmen were frequently pun-
ctuated with phrases concern-.
ing the “outdated system."
"irrelevant initiation procedures"
and the questionable benefits
of fraternity versus dormitory
living. Many were skeptical
about the actual number of their

peers who will decide to pledge.
With rush ending September

‘ 22, the number of pledges will

indicate to some extent the out-
come of the Greeks’ new rush
approach and the possible fu-
ture of fraternities at Pitt.

ALL engineers interested in
learning about student aid
should hear Charles Dees of
the Student Aid Office, who
will speak Thursday at 11 a.m.
in Benedum Hall. -

passage of two bills now in
legislative committees that
would prevent Pennsylvanians
from being forced to serve in

an undeclared war.

Irvis told the demonstrators
the bills might be unconstitu-

tional because they aimed at
negating federal action by
State law.

“What you really want is a
statement of policy by the Penn-
sylvania legislature," Irvis said.

Although he couldn’t promise
that the bills would pass, Irvis
said there are other ways to

have the topic discussed on the
floor of the House.

The protestors-including "a

tunities and drug and psycho-
logical rehabilitation programs.

“The United States could

1 have the best soccer teams in
the world.“ commented veteran
soccer star Gus Theofilus. "Right
now there is really no soccer
_.inthe US."

A Theofilus.‘ a native of Athens,
.Greece and presently residing
-in Linden. New Jersey, went
;,into the difference between the
quality of soccer both in the
United States and in Europe,
‘and between different parts of
' the United States.

"Because they have speed
and intelligence, Americans
could have the best soccer in the
world." said Theofilus. who is
now waiting to see if he will
be playing for the booters this
year. "If they learned the skills
theylwould be very great.

Associate Sports Editor

 9 Last week, Panther Coach Carl DePasqua stat-
' ed that"Bill Englert usually makes the least amount
"of mistakes of all the sophomore halfbacks. In his
1 first varsity game on Saturday night at UCLA, Eng-
lert sparkledin limited action although he admits.
".1 made plenty of mistakes."

 Although Englert carried the ball only seven

’ times. he racked up a total of 39 yards for a'5.6 av-
3 erage. In addition. he caughtthree passes for a sum
k ‘of 20 yards. Two of them were key third down aeri-
, als which kept two touchdown drives alive.

Bill feels that some of his mistakes are due to
. his relative newness at the position. Originally. he
played defensive back for the frosh and was switch-
ed to halfback midway through the spring drills.

_ I “I wasn’t picking up the defense naturally,” he
says, “so I asked to be switched.”

,In the spring Blue-Gold intrasquad game, Eng-
lert broke loose on several fine "runs as he did
against the Bruins. For both contests, he attributes
his success to the play of the offensive line.

“Nobody on the defense was ever waiting for
me—the line always did a great job. By the time I
got into the game, they were opening really nice
holes. I can sure thank the line for doing so well." .

After viewing the game films, Englert cited an-
other reason for his ability to gain big yardage.

“On a lot of plays, the faking in the backfield
opened up a lot of holes. It may have meant only a
half a step but it gave the blockers "a better angle. “

Coming to Pitt was Englert’s only desire after
his high school career at Upper St. Clair. Although
many schools recruited him. he signed with the
Panthers on the first day available.

“Ichose Pitt because it was close to home and a
lo.t of friends could see me play. Also, Pitt has one
of the best schedules in the country.”

Bill experienced a touch of fear upon entering
the monstrous LA Coliseum for the first time.

“I looked around and saw all of those empty
seats, and the size didn't compare with anyplace I
had ever played in.“ he said with a smile.

“In the states they are very
fast and very tough,” he continu-
ed. “You get hurt easier in com-

parison to foreign countries.”

The veteran booter has now
been in the country for three
and a half years. He feels that
he is different from many of
the other players because he is
not considered a foreign student.
In approximately a year and a

half he will. have his American

citizenship.

At the present time the ques-
tion of Theofilus‘ soccer eligi-
bility is in question. Going into
this semester he did not have
enough credits to allow him to
play for the soccer squad. He
is investigating the possibilities
of playing now and states that
if he is denied eligibility he will
appeal the decision.

“I don’t blame anyone for my
situation specifically,” he com-

!I|IIlIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIE

He felt that the field was in great shape consider-
ing that it had been used for two previous nights.
However, the field at Pitt Stadium excells.

"Astro-turf is the greatest. There's no dirt and it
helps my traction and cutting."

Because he had an idea that he may see action at
UCLA, Bill remembers worrying about making
mistakes that may have cost the game.

“I made enough to know about them, but I guess
I’ll get better only with experience. The best thing
is being able to make them, yet we still won the

game.”

\

It looks like Bill Englert will have plenty of op-
portunities to correct his miscues in the next three

seasons.

Referring to the quality of the
team this year, ’l‘heofilus has a
lot of confidence in the talent
of the squad. He felt that .last
year's team was both “talented

and had potential, but we were ..

unlucky.”

‘-‘Winning this year depends
on whether Gary Midock re-
covers.” said the booter. Midock
is now out with a knee injury.
The team also must overcome the
loss of Ali Rdissi and Tom Jones,
both of whom quit the squad.

Rdissi left the team due-to
academic reasons and Jones,
according to Theofilus, “didn’t
love soccer as much as he thought
he did.”

Theofilus was a bit critical of
American soccer players.

“U.S. soccer players think more
about winning for themselves
-rather than for the college.

Gus Theofilus’ Eligibility Doubtful

.They don’t care if they hurt‘ the
other players," he said..

The senior booter cited an in-
stance last year in the West
Chester game, when Pitt was
the contest 2-1 with
five minutes left. “The West
Chester people realized that they
had lost,“ Theofilus said, "so
they were out .to hurt some
players."

Being a New Jersey resident,
Theofilus compared soccer in
the East compared to that of
Western Pennsylvania.

"‘It’s different. There are
more people from Europe in
New York and other ship ports,”
commented the booter. “Euro-

peans change soccer because it '

is their own sport. There.are bet-
ter teams in Jersey because they
have European players."

In a few days, Gus Theofilus
might be able to add his Euro-
pean talents to the Pitt squad,
as they battle Bucknell at the

Overlooking Panthers

The Pitt victory over UCLA has .

been history for four days now,
but people won’t be forgetting it
for a long time. .

The Panthers are off this week-
end, giving them two weeks to get
in shape for the Oklahoma Soon-
ers on Sept. 25 for the Cats’ home
opener. They returned from the
coast with a pretty healthy squad,
suffering only one major injury.
John, Simpson, according to the
team physician, will be out for
/three weeks with a separated
shoulder.

Steve Moyer, who suffered a
slight shoulder separation should
be ready for action against the
Sooners. Danny Lynn had his leg
in a cast for the past four days in
order to prevent him from mov-
ing it. _He’ll be able to start run-
ning on Friday.

The Bruins on the other hand

can’t spend too much time lick-9

ing their wounds. They have an
appointment against the Long-

The track season was coming to
a close, and Smittie Browns days
as a Pitt athlete were numbered.

His coach, Jim Banner. chose this A

setting to pay "Brown the highest
compliment a coach can pay one
. of his athletes.

perlatives to describe him. He's a
tremendous person and the hard-
est, diligeni worker I‘ve ever

“Nice Guy" Brown had earned
Banners respect by his achieve-
ments on the track as well as on
the practice field. Now. it appears
that Banner'won‘t have to be rein-
carnated to experience Brown all
over again.

When Dennis Johnson’s tenure
as a part-time coach came to an
end, the way was open for Banner
to hire Brown, on a full time basis.

As an athlete, Brown was one of
the most liked. and most respect-
ed of the team. The mile relay
team was one.» of the best in the
East because of him in the anchor
position. The opinion was that if
the relay team was close, Brown
would pull it out. Also, Brown ran
the fastest 600 in thecountry dur-
ing the regular season last year.

Brown, intimately known as
Burner because of what he did to
the track,,will be a great addition
to the already existing cohesive-
ness of the track team.

staff to make a start. Banner is
the winningest coach in Pitt his-
tory. Don Mollenauer, another
assistant, has had nothing but a
winning background while he
was at Mt. Lebanon High School
and here last year.

So, instead of being at the end of
an illustrious athletic ‘career,
Brown finds himself at the thres-
hold of a coaching one.

"All the progress that I have
made since I came here," said
Brown, “I owe to Banner. He
really knows how to help you.

Comparitively Banner must feel
that Brown can really help him.

from the fact that Brown is black,
Utley knows what Brown can
mean to the team.

“I’m very happy that they hired
Smittie," said Utley. "I've been
calling him ‘Coach Smittie‘ for
about a week now.”

“Coach Smittie!“ That has a

nice ring to it. Even better than
Burner.

NEWMAN-MARTIN:

I MOREIIN COMMON THAN JUST SIX LETTERS:

’ nnuce MARTIN

We have written this statement to express our enthusiasm concerning one

of the actors in the television program “The Edge of Night.” His name is Bruce

Martin, and he plays the duel role of Keith Whitney and Jonah Lockwood with

a brilliance and expertise that is unequalled, even in the films of today. The

versatil’ity which he exhibits in his performance as a deceptive madman places

him already in a category of talent far surpassing the actors which we normally

see, and his charismatic appeal virtually oozes from the screen when his talents

are on display.

This dynacism, this mastery of his art, this tremendous and gripping appeal

—it is of such a magnitude as to compel college students, as well as others, to

s'it fervently glued to their television sets while Bruce demonstrates his versa-V

tility and greatness on a “soap-opera” type of program—an illustration of the fact

that his popularity base is far m-ore vast than the audiences usually attributed

to this form of programming.

The great enthusiasm that we are here forced by conviction to express is

in itself indicative of the tremendous power that we believe to be inherant in

this man, and to see him fade from the public eye would be a tragedy so great

as to sicken the hearts of all true conneisseurs of acting, entertainment, or merely

of excellence in any realm of expression.

Such a fade is, however, quite unlikely, for it is difficult if not impossible

to believe -that such a reservoir of ability as Bruce Martin could exist without

due recognition.

We must therefore expect to see much, much more of him in the future,

andit is our most sincere desire to soon find him ascending to the position of

greatness and prestige that is so rightfully his.
