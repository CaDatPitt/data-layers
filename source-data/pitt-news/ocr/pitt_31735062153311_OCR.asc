In this connection it is interesting
to note. that Lieutenant Fukuda of

, One of the most pleasing features
of the baseball team’s easternﬂtrip,
outside of its ﬁne w-ork on the dia-
mond, _was the _ entertainment 1 re-
ceived at the hands of the opposing
colleges. Especially was “this true
at.Providence, the day of‘ the game
with Brown ‘University, when they
were the guests of Dr. .A. L. Midg-
ley,. prominent Providence dentist,
and close friend of Dr.  E. Frie-
sell, dean of -the Dental School. Dr.

 

at which the Mayor of Providence
Hwas present.- The mayor delivered
the key to the city to Coach Har-
ley. The team was loud in its
praise of Providence hospitality.
The team made -a splendid record
on the trip, an even break being. bet-
ter than was expected. The victories
over Yale and Rhode Island State
were particlarly pleasing and the
team played some ﬁne baseball in
the Brown game which was lost -by
a one-run margin. Even in -face of
the overwhelming defeat at the hands
of Holy Cross, which probably, has
the classiest college team in the
country, the team
with glory. The only sad feature of
the trip was the injury to Jack
Clawson, who had asmall bone in his
hand broken. Jack had been play-
ing a. lbang-up gameat the first sack.
It is not known just how serious
the injury is or how long it will
keep him out -of the game.

“Hinkie” Haines, Penn Stateis ver-
satlle and all-around athlete and cap-
tain of their undefeated baseball
team, will not be in the line-up against
_the Panthers this afternoon. It ap-
pears that Haines played professional
baseball two years under the name
of Hinke'y in the Virginia. State
League.
the' Hinkey of the Petersburg (Va.)
team has just recently been conﬁrmed
from Virginia sources.

Haines, following the accusation of
his professionalism, resigned the
captaincy of the State nine and has
not played since. He admits that he
played professional ball in the Vir-
ginia State League, but says that he
did not know that he -was ‘violating
State’s eligibility code. No official ac-
tion has been taken by the State au-
thorities barring Haines, but that is
expected soon.

Haines has starred for State in
three branches of athletics, footfbau,
basketball, and baseball, and ranks
as the most popular athlete at the
Centre -county, institution. This is his
last year at State,
