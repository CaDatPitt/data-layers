Student Health Center
tests student for measles

By Mark R. Brown
Staff Writer

There has been an uncon-
firmed but probable case of nine-
day measles (Rubeola) found in
a Pitt student. According to direc-
tor of Student Health Services
Franklin Carter, ’’It is not con-
firmed yet. Blood samples were
sent to Harrisburg for analysis,
but it is our clinical opinion that
the student has measles.”

Pitt health officals have been
working with the Allegheny
County Health Department to
contact any individuals who may
have come in contact with the
student.

Rubeola should not be con-
fused with Rubella (German
measles). Rubeola does not cause
birth defects.

Rubeola is characterized by the
following symptoms: fever, run-
ny nose, cough and watery eyes,
followed in three to seven days
by a red, blotchy rash. The illness
lasts from one to two weeks.

According to Pitt Health offi-

cals, you are considered immune
to measles if:

You were born before 1957
and have had a confirmed case
of Rubeola.

You were immunized against
Rubeola after Jan. 1, 1969, when
the vaccines were strengthened,
and you were immunized after
15 months.

”Measles is an airborne-type
disease, transmitted by coughing
or sneezing. People sharing pipes
or cigarettes or [who] are in close
Contact with others are running a
risk,” said Carter.

According to Carter, "Measles
is highly contagious, but general-
ly not too serious. Someone can
be sick with it for seven to 14
days, but the side effects can be
worse." Some possible side ef-
fects are pneumonia and en-
cephalitis, but Carter said these
are rare cases.

In a statement issued by Cart-
er, ’’If no additional cases [of
Rubeola] appear by the end of
this week, we can conclude that
this was an isolated case."

approval in

By Michael Blood

Associated Press Writer

HARRISBURG —— Local
government groups Wednes-
day gave a stamp of approval
to the bulk of a tax reform
package approved by the
House, but also suggested
some changes.

The Pennsylvania Local
Government Conference,
representing a broad range of
municipal and county govern-
ments and school districts, told
a Senate committee the
House-endorsed tax bills offer
a plausible way to cut reliance
on property taxes.

”These bills attest to the fact
that there can be consensus on
the very complex and politi-
cally sensitive issue of local tax
reform," conference Chairman
Jay Himes told members of the
Committee on Legislation.

"The bill before you is not
perfect, but a perfect solution
is probably not obtainable on
this issue,” Himes said.

The House bills, which in-
corporate most of Gov. Robert
P. Casey's recommendations
on tax reform, would allow
municipalities and school dis-
tricts to impose income taxes
and permit counties to impose
sales taxes intended to help

Harrisburg

offset property tax levies.

The legislation would also
eliminate so-called nuisance
taxes, such as occupational as-
sessment, and also offers a
plan for reducing the Philadel-
phia wage and commuter
taxes.

Hines told the committee
the two-bill package address-
es many concerns of the con-
ference, which represents
such groups as the League of
Cities, the Pennsylvania
School Boards Association and
the Pennsylvania State Associ-
ation of County Commis-
sioners.

”The major benefit of the
new taxing authority will be a
reduction in the property tax
reliance by all local tax juris-
dictions,” he said.

Himes, however, pinpoint-
ed several areas needing
change, including a provision
in the House bill permitting a
municipality to tax individuals
who work in the community
with a flat rate up to $20 to
recognize municipal services.

Himes said the group fa-
vored a return to Casey's
proposal, which would have
allowed municipalities to im-
pose a .01 percent services tax
on the wages of commuting
workers.

Group advocates social change

By Brendan Kevenides
Staff Writer

A new organization concerned
with helping students achieve so
cial change has been officially
recognized by the Student
Government Board at the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh.

The New Student Network for
Social Change, formerly The Pitts-
burgh Student Network, is a
group emphatically concerned
with human rights and with seek-
ing out different means for
achieving social change.

”[We want to] show students
that they can change the world —
at least a little bit of it,” said Bill
Frizlen, founder of the organiza-
tion at Pitt.

According to some of its mem-
bers, the NSN is part of a new
wave of ”|eftist” student move-
ments forming nationwide. This
movement received its initial
spark last January at Hampshire
College in Vermont. On Feb. 5
through 7 the Student National
Convention was held at Rutgers
University with the main purpose
being to unite these movements
into a potent network for con-
cerned students.

According to NSN president
Angie Hirsh, ’’It [the convention]
was successful. [We achieved a]
sense of community amoung stu-
dents.”

The meeting also saw the ratifi-
cation of the group's recently
drawn up constitution.

The NSN is very much con-
cerned with uniting many of the
single-issue groups at Pitt. ”We

don't want to fuse these groups
together, [however]. They, (i.e.,
religious organizations) have
ideologies which [bond] them,"
said Hirsh. ”We have no official
platform —— it is a network.”

Joel Rapoport, co—chairperson
of the Gay and Lesbian Alliance,
said, however, "The NSN makes
the voices of single-issue groups
a little louder. [They bring] every-
one together toward a better so-
ciety.” He explained that the
NSN helped GALA with the peti-
tioning to get the SGB to include
sexual orientation as part of the
university's Equal Opportunity
Statement. He further comment-
ed that the NSN helps achieve
better communication for single-
interest groups.

Besides working with GALA,
the NSN has worked with various
church groups and, in the future,
hopes to work with the Black Ac-
tion society.

Frizlen compared the NSN to
the radicals of the 60s. ”The [rad-
icals] of the 605 made mistakes -
they were too abrasive." He said
they were alike in that both
movements wish to achieve the
same goals but that they [NSN]
have different ways of going
about it."

He also said they, in conjunc-
tion with GALA, will be con-
structing a shanty for the plight of
the homeless. The purpose for
doing this is to take up a collec-
tion of food and clothing and to
make people realize the serious-
ness of the homelessness in the
United States. There will be no
demonstrations, no riots, just a

peaceful project to bring the
problem to the public‘s attention.

"We want a voice not just be
rebellious," said Hirsh. She com-
mented that there may be some
ideological confrontations with
other groups in this country;
however, she stressed that the
NSN is a non-violent organi-
zation.

"We want to make the world
better for humanity, but we want
to keep it low key," added
Frizlen.

Another method the NSN has
used to project the voices of con-
cerned students is through letter-
writing campaigns such as the
one during the end of January
concerning funding for the
Contras.

Hirsh explained that the NSN
offers a great deal of freedom to
all group members. She said’ if
someone has a project they wish
to undertake, all that must be
done is have an official organiz-
er and receive approval from 50
percent of the group members.
She said this is what a network
offers over a group with an offi-
cial platform.

Concern has arisen within the
organization as to whether the
NSN can accurately be called a
leftist organization. Frizlen ex-
pressed his concern:

”We are students for human
rights, not leftists.” However,
Hirsh said many people in the or-
ganization are to the left political-
ly. She also said, for the most
part, people within the group are
"not happy with the power struc-
ture in this society.”

New Hampshire
land of opportunity

After Tuesday night's New Hampshire primary, little has
changed in both the Republican and Democratic fields. Ge-
orge Bush, the winner among the Republicans with about one
third of the vote, relied heavily during the last days before the
primary on his association with Ronald Reagan. The winner
for the Democrats, Michael Dukakis, was virtually a shoe-in,
because of New Hampshire's proximity to Massachusetts, where
Dukakis is a popular governor.

With nearly three weeks remaining before Super Tuesday,
when 17 states will hold their primaries, the presidential cam-
paigns will enter their second phase.

Dole, who has developed a voting base of independents and
‘Republican moderates, will stand a better chance in the South,
where Bush and Robertson are expected to split the conserva-
tive vote.

For the Democrats, Super Tuesday will be Jesse Jackson's turn
to shine. In New Hampshire, Jackson showed that he could
command a respectable percentage of the white vote, although
a large portion of his support is expected to come from the var-
ious minority voting blocs. Dukakis and Richard Gephardt, the
two current favorites among the Democrats, will have to focus
their campaigning on taking votes from Jackson and Albert Gore,
who has a strong ”native son” appeal in the south.

Before too much emphasis is put on the results of the New
Hampshire primary, and the winners there, it should be remem-
bered that the profile of the campaign has gone through at least
two major transformations already, and more can probably be
expected.

Ashland hasn't ”bought” Pitt

This is in response to the letter
in the Feb. 3 Pitt News which
questioned the University of Pitts-
burgh’s accepting a $250,000
grant from Ashland Oil to study
the effects of the recent diesel oil
spill into the Monongahela River.

The university's Center for
Hazardous Materials Research
(CHMR) will coordinate and con-
duct an independent, ol)jective
one-year study of the short- and
long-term public health and eco-
logical effects arising from the
spill. CHMR will also examine
emergency preparedness pro-
grams and remedial technologies
in place along both river systems
and recommend areas for im-
provement.

Ashland Oil will have no role
in the formulation of the study or
its conclusions and recommenda-
tions. The effort under the grant
will be carried out by CHMR staff
and various university faculty

LETTERS

members with relevant expertise.

The findings from the study, as
well as the methodology used,
will be made public on a period-
ic basis. An open meeting on
(7HMR's progress to (late is
scheduled for Tuesday, Feb. I6 at
.2. it) p.m. in Benedum Au-
ditorium.

Cl IMR is the largest non—prot'it
organi/_aIion in Pennsylvania
specializing in applied research,
education, training and technical
assistance on hazardous
materials.

We began our effort on the spill
with funding supplied by an ex-
isting grant from the Department
of Environmental Resources un-
der which CHMR provides tech-
nical information to communities
impacted by hazardous materials
incidents. The Ashland grant al-

lowed CHMR to expand this ef-
fort considerably.

Clearly, there are important les-
sons to be learned from the Ash-
land incident. The spi|l’s impact
on water quality and the ecolo-
gy must be assessed and under-
stood. The ability of the various
communities to deal with the
spill as it passed through must be
e\amine(l. In short, the spill, and

. the lessons it otfei's, cannot be

igi iored.

(Pl IMR accepted the responsi-
bility for this independent study
because we believe the public,

legitimate questions on the effects
of the spill that must be an-
sxxerecl.

A letter arrived this morning.
It's a fun letter, but since the
author forgot to include his real
name and phone number, it
didn't jive with The Pitt News
editorial policy. So, it had to be
excluded from the ”letters to be
run” pile. Much to the chagrin of
all, I might add.

However, since The Naked
City was conceived without an
editorial policy, here it is:

Page one coverage for Nation-
al Condom Week! is this a put-
on or what? I'm sorry, but pin the
condom on the man hurts just
thinking about it. (If you must
play this game, don't get any
blood on you.) I prefer the more
pleasant diversions of Post
Orifice and Blind Man's Muff
(You can't print this kind of stuff,
can you?)

Janet Devoe, of technorock and
housepaint fame, says, ”One
week a year is not enough.” Try

telling my old lady that! Ms. De-
voe also says that condoms are
close to I00 percent effective.
Yeah, but only if you wear them
on your nose in public so that no
one will want to make even eye
contact, let alone whoopee, with
you.

Natural condoms  UGH! La-
dies, do you realize that when
your man dons a natural con-
dom, he is about to have sex with
the business end of a dead
sheep's digestive system, and
he's going to do it in your vagi-
na? Isn't that how the whole AIDS
thing got started?

And what about Kent Baldauf,
president Protex of SGB? Was he
too busy living up to the family
name to be aware of National
Condom Week? In any event, we
do know where IFC president
Chuck was with his lovely lady
Ella. '

Prof. Phil Lactic

On Tuesday morning, 6 a.m. to
be exact, there was a power out-
age in Oakland.

I was sitting in bed, scraping
the sleep out of my eyes. Sudden-
ly everything went
”Mother was right, I rubbed my
eyes too hard, and now I'm
blind,” was the first thing that
came screaming into my mind.

black.

Eventually, common sense tri-
umphed and I realized that the
electricity had gone out.

I lit a match, and found my way
out of my bedroom. (Stubbing left
big toe on the dresser and right
little toe on the door frame.) I lit
a candle, and walked into the
livingroom, where, to my suprise,
I saw that the streetlights were
out, too.

BLACKOUT! Hordes of
marauding looters! Just like in
New York. Mayhem. Panic. To-
tal destruction of the institutions
we hold dear. Yes, anarchy was
in the air on that chill, Winter
morn.

So I walked out onto the porch
to get in on it.

Instead of chaos, I found some-
thing that was really neat.

Well, for starters, it was dark.
I grew up in the absolute middle
of cow country, so darkness at
night usually doesn't strike me as
odd. But dammit, I was standing
in the middle of a major
metropolitan area, and it was
dark. I could actually see stars.
Because of the streetlights, I'd
grown accustomed to pink, star-
less nights. It was neat.

There's a steel mill in
Homestead. I can see its pretty
much constant plume of steam
every day. And, if it's clear, it's
usually visible at night, too.

Yesterday morning, it shone as
if it were on fire. The steam cloud
caught the light from the flames
underneath it, and the clouds
burned a bright orange into the
predawn sky.

I noticed flashlight beams
bouncing from room to room in
my neighbors’ homes.

I went into my apartment and
lit a few candles and marveled at
how much brighter they seemed
in pretty much total darkness.

I laughed at how conditioned

I am when I walked into the
bathroom and automatically
reached for the light switch, even-
though I knew that there was no
electricity.

In addition to the dark was
quiet. No noisy refrigerator, no
radio, no aquarium pumps. Just
the birds outside, and an oc-
casional car passing by.

I was just starting to boil water
to make some coffee, (”This is
how we did it in the depression,”
Cramma would have said) when
the lights came back on.

So I turned them back off,
finished boiling my water, took a
shower by candlelight, watched
the sunrise, and came to school.
Glorious day.

I found out something bad
yesterday. There's a national
magazine that has a featured
column called The Naked City,
and I am distressed.

I'm tempted to change the
name of this column. Should I? If
I do, what would be a good name
for it? Send in a suggestion.
Please keep it serious, I'm
depressed as hell over this.

Thank you.

Baby, the University

Theatre's latest production,
can be likened to a woman’s
pregnancy. Initially, there is
exuberant joy and anticipation
but later, exhaustion and an
ever-present wondering, "Will
this Baby ever come?”

As the musical opens, the
cast dances around the stage
with males representing sperm
and females ovum in a simu-
lation of conception. A
swirling female dancer is the
newly released ovum being
pursued by the male troupe,
moving in a slow-motion run
toward their target.

This is followed by a num-
ber introducing the three cou-
ples who are comtemplating
pregnancy.

The youngest couple, Lizzie
and Danny (Jane Gentry and
Michael Soli), are college stu-
dents surprised to learn that
they're expecting. Pam and
Nick (Karla Rosenthal and
Brad Lichtenstein) are a faculty
couple who have been trying
to conceive for two years. And
finally, Arlene and Alan
(Mavourneen Dwyer and
Dean Patterson) are the

0IIIOouu-c---

I I
o o I c I c I I u 0 0 I I
. . . . - u a I 0 I n I I I I

  This Baby crawls along

middle—aged couple whose
last child has just left the nest.
Their expectant arrival is the
biggest shock, since they'd
been viewing their final years
as being alone, together.
The bouncy musical num-
bers nicely performed by the
cast, along with the expectant
humor, promise an evening of
light entertainment. But, as the
play progresses and we dis-
cover a little more about each
couple’s problems, a more
somber mood prevails.

While Danny and Lizzie
have accepted their baby’s ex-
pected arrival, they can't agree
on marriage. Lizzie is afraid
she'll become ”a wife/’rob—
bing her of her independence
and stifling Danny’s life. Their
naivete is clearly apparent.

Pam and Nick just can't
seem to conceive. And while
there's humor, as they perform
the prescribed acrobatics in
hopes of conception, there's
also gravity, as these necessary
antics strip the romance from
their union.

The most serious side of the
play involves Alan and
Arlene's decision. Though
never clearly spoken or sung,
they see-saw between whether
or not to continue the preg-
nancy. Arlene is the most torn.

  

Seeing herself as always a par-
ent, she's been happily an-
ticipating life alone with her
husband. The fact that she and
Alan are parents makes them
the only couple to see their fu-
ture realistically. Yet Alan, be-
ing somewhat afraid of a life
without young children, is
anxiously willing to start a se-
tond family.

All of these problems con-
tribute to the downward swing
and slower movement of the
second act. However, David
Weidman’s (lirection, Susan
(}illis and Weidman’s
choreography, as well as
Lawrence Goldberg's musical
direction, provide a contrast to
the slowness.

Designed by Diane Mel-
chitsky, the set, comprised of
an abundance of pastel blocks,
a bed at the center and over-
hung screens where child-like
drawings are projected
throughout the musical all
help to promote the happiness
and delight of pregnancy.

While the play may move
too slowly for some, just like
a pregnancy, several expectant
couples in the audience ap-
peared to enjoy it all. It just
may be that this one is for
those expecting, or planning
to conceive, that ”b|essed
event”

Staff Writer

It's not a common occurrence
for Pittsburgh to attract a musical
group of worldwide stature. This
Sunday, however, promises to be
a pleasant exception when the
North Side’s James Street Tavern
and P.j_ Mc/\rdle welcome
Capercaillie, a rising sextet from
Scotland who are named after a
large, turkey-like bird that roams
the misty forests oi‘ their country.

In the past year alone, Caper-
caillie have toured Canada, Eu-
rope and the Middle East,
bringing their hearty brand of
Hebridean Gaelic traditional and
original music to an ever-
increasing audience. The group
produced their own series of
shows for BBC Radio Scotland
that provided them with needed
national exposure.

Now in the midst ot a lengthy
United States trelc, Capercaillie
are riding on the c rest oi their se-
cond album, (ross\yi'iicls, on the
domestic (lreen linnet label. The
piistinely produced l l’ shows the

band at their yery best, mixing
li\t‘l\ jigs ancl ieels with gentler
ballads and aiis.

The oyerall conteniporary l()ll'\
sound of (tossixilic/s brings to

mind the early work by the
prominent lrish group Clannad.
Though, unfortunately, Clannad
have succumbed to the bland,
bastardized fusion that usually
comes with major label status,
Caperciaillie recall their melodic‘
intensity.

The group is‘ also blessed with
the uplifting, sweet voice of Ka-
ren Matheson, who stirs the emo-
tions on such songs as ”Ma Theid
Mise Tuilleadh." "Urnaigh A
’Bhan-Thigreach" (The Tiger-
Woman’s Prayer) is a moving ac‘-
count of the famine in Ethiopia.
The heartfelt honesty oi her yo-
cal delivery makes one wonder
why anyone cares about cor-
porate puppets lilce Skinhead
()'Conner.

Matheson is ably supported by
the talents’ of the five musicians,
all ot whom are well—versecl in
the repertoire oi (jaelic music.
The fiddle of Charlie Mc Kerron
and the recorder oi" Marc Duti

This Scottish sextet brings more than bagpipes to the James Street tavern. It's rock ‘n’ roll, folks.

while sacrificing none of the es-
sential Celtic origins of the music.

”Puirt A Beul," the very first
song c)n the record, combines all
the complex harmonies and
bouncy instrumentation in a most
satistyiiig way. Request that song
and others by Capercaillie on
WYEP during their morning
American Sampler show, and
you'll experience a sincere treat.

Capercaillie are currently com-
posing the soundtrack tor the
Blood is Strong, a British
documentary series on the tribu-
lations otthe (iaelic people. The
programs will grace public tele-
vision in the United States this
tall.

Until that time, their Sunday
concert is a rare chance for Pitts-
burghers to see what new blood
c an do for an ancient, yet always
vibrant art. So quit banging your
head, and come listen to some or
the most strilsingly beautitul mus-
ic eyer created on (}od’s green

earth.

Local music addicts who crave
even more entertainment this
weekend can catch Cars‘ic'l<ness
and Special Ed at the Squirrel Hill
American Legion for an over-2|
show tomorrow night.

The latest news from Carsicl\-
ness is that they are tavoring a
more stripped-clown, guitar-
oriented version of their trade-
mark punl<—tunlc danceable sound
following the departure of one or
their saxmen, Bob Wensel. (ai-
sl('l\lT(“ss is worlcing on a new c as-
sette release or studio material,

Meanwhile, Spec ial Ed plans to

It is unlikely that the Beatles
and bell-bottoms would bring to
mind the 17th Century
playwright Moliere. However, in
this case, they should. The
University of Pittsburgh Main-
stage is producing a somewhat
contemporary, version of
Moliere’s The Misanthrope.

This adaptation is set in 1966,
exactly 300 years after the origi-
nal production. This modern ver-
sion of a timeless classic was

recreated by Tony Harrison. Har-
rison saw many parallels between
the Court of Louis XIV and the
government of Charles De
Caulle. In both time periods, the
political atmosphere was that of
authoritarianism and centralized
government control.

  This hip production should

ety as being filled with pretense.

The central character Alceste  I
(played by Harry Bouvy) wants all ’ .

pletly honest. He despises social
hypocrisy. Alceste won't even go
as far as to give flattery where it
is not deserved. His insistence on
complete candor in a society that
thrives on superficiality causes
him to exile himself.

This action seems to indicate

Sign -‘O’ the‘ Times: His Royal Badness onstage ,

By Rico Gagliano

For The Pitt News

O.K., O.K., he's weird, I admit
ll.

Prince, that chartbusting hit-
maker, wears women's lingerie,
a telegram delivery boy's outfit,
huge, mirrored, heart-shaped
bracelets, stiletto—hee|ed boots,
and about l2,0()0 pounds of
jewelry during the course of his
tliird feature film, Sign ’O’ the
limes.

But let's face it, the man is
talented.

Prince plays all the instruments
on the album that Sign gets its
name from, and though he only
gets to play guitar, piano and
drums in the film (It is, after all,

9,? 1,-3%‘ —»

Q

59”“   "
5° it ﬂ“
\

l

a concert movie), his prowess on
them more than hints at his other
musical skills.

As a vocalist, the man can go
from a James Brown caterwaul to
a bizarrely high falsetto without
batting a false eyelash, and when
he commands his audience to
"sing this with me,” there is no
doubt of the authority behind that
voice.

As far as the backup band,
there is probably no tighter crew
in all of pop music, save maybe
Sting’.s Blue Turtles (why is it that
the most talented pop artists have
no last names?) Sheila E. rips off
a drum solo that puts even John
Bonham to shame, then switches
places with Prince to belt out
some vocals of her own.

The rest of the band is excellent

as well, particularly the key-
boardist ”the doctor,” who is the
only leftover from Prince's usual
touring group The Revolution.
The horn section is also commed-
able and even includes a number
of Pittsburgh artists.

Standout songs in the film are
basically the same as those on the
album, Sign ‘O’ the Times: ‘’I
Could Never Take the Place of
Your Man,” ”Housequake,” and
"Hot Thing" all make one wish
they were watching the movie at
a nightclub so's to do some
dancin’.

The finale, the anthem—like,
"The Cr().s‘s‘," shows Prince at his
best, despite the overly religious
i\ llt s. Bending his body like the
strings on his guitar, His Royal
is‘.iilness looks momentarily like

the late Jimi Hendrix, and
whether this effect is intended or
not, he. evokes, in the audience,
the same reaction as Hendrix
once did —— awe.

The photography, directed by
Prince himself, is an improve-
ment on the typical video, as the
c amera avoids, for the most part,
ambiguous images, as well as
stay ing away from over-extended
irowtl reaction shots. Overall,

Sign ’O' the Times proves that
Prince is best when he just gets
onstage and burns, rather than
trying to act, as he did in last in
last year's fiasco Under the Cher-
ry Moon. Hopefully, the man will
find it in his heart to bless this city
with a live performance one day.

I must start off by correcting something I stated in my last column: The city's newest all-female band
has a male drummer. I found out when I saw them play at the Squirrel Hill American Legion Hall.
The ladies (and gentleman) really rocked! As the best twist since the Little Wretches’ violin, The Pleas-
ure Heads’ statuesque bass player whipped out a cello for a few songs  Headlining that night were
the Crowflies, who held their own admirably even though one of their guitarists was missing.

It just so happens that the guitarist, Evan Knauer, also plays with A.T.S. and since A.T.S. was out
of town, Evan was too  The bbig Bbronk reunion was lots of fun right down to the cover of AC/DC's
”Back in Black”  The Little Wretches’ new single is out. Their cover of the Velvet Underground's
”What Goes On” has always been a crowd pleaser in concert —— it's just wonderful on vinyl  Pato
Banton, premier toaster (no, not as in the kitchen appliance, sillies), has a fine new LP called Never
Give In. It features Ranking Roger (English Beat, General Public)  ’’I can't believe this record is on
a major label,” is the first thing I said to myself when I heard a wonderful slab 0’ vinyl from The Slam-
min’ Watusis. It's se|f—titled and on Epic Records. Kind of reminds me what would happen if you crossed
The Lounge Lizards with The Lyres  Speaking of The Lyres, frontman Jeff Connolly has just complet-
ed a single with former (and probably future) lead Deadboy, Stiv Bators. It's due out next month 

Much better than the new live (really dead, if you ask me) Kinks LP is the Fall's cover of ”Victoria”

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, February I8, I988

TV voyeur bathes in Rather’s lather for 48 Hours  

By David Ballarotto

Staff Writer

Well, the wandering TV critic
is back for his biweekly look at
those wonderful airwave pollu-
tants. While grazing the pastures
of life, I stumbled across some-
thing that is so interesting, origi-
nal and informative that it will
probably be gone before we've
all had the chance to see it.

The program I'm talking about
is Dan Rather’s new news and in-
formation program called 48
Hours, which appears Tuesdays
at 8 p.m. on CBS. Each week, a
group of CBS cameramen, report-
ers and producers stalk a topical
story for two days and two nights.

This program stems from the
CBS News special 48 Hours on
Crack Street, which aired in the
fall of 1986 nationwide and was
given a special screening last year
in Pitt dorms,

This program takes any topic
that's making the news and tries
to bring it home, to make the
viewer feel as if they were par-
ticipating.

And the show does not just
whitewash.

It has shown a brain surgeon
performing his job, even though
he was not having one of his bet-
ter days.

It has also featured the almost
revolting sight of Las Vegas peo-
ple who are so addicted to gam-
bling that they go to the
supermarket just to play the slot
machines.

With such effective use of the
camera, it is not really Dan
Rather who is the "star” of the
show, but instead, the camera-
men who shoot the scene.

Credit must also be given to the
CBS News reporters who take 48
hours out of their busy schedules

to track down these stories. And
the stories they have shown us in-
clude the presidential candidates,
the Israeli situation and American
hospitals.

With such diversity, effective
camera styles and moving stories,
48 Hours is one of the more crea-
tive and engrossing programs to
hit the airwaves in a long time.

But don't get too used to it.

The program has been moved
opposite The Cosby Show and A
Different World, the top two pro-
grams in the land.

Catch it if you can.

Grade: A

1' I ll ll

Speaking ofA Different World,
I've been a little bit late in review-
ing this program. But this show
has become the object of so
many jokes and complaints, I
think it's time someone spoke up
for it.

Let's admit one thing about this
show. It is not as entertaining as
The Cosby Show. However, Lisa
Bonet’s portrayal of Denise Hux-
table’s life at Hillman College is
still entertaining enough.

After all, we've got Jaleesa, a
divorcee (played by Dawnn
Lewis), Maggie (Marissa Tomei)
who is a little bit dizzy, and
we've got Dwayne Wayne, the
Big Pest on Campus (Kadeem
Hardison).

But best of all, there's the snob
of snobs, Whitley Gilbert, played
expertly by Jasmine Guy. If you
don't like the storyline, you still
have the privilege of having a
hilarious Whitley remark to either
Denise or Jaleesa.

Lately, all the characters have
had the chance to grow and take
the spotlight off Bonet’s charac-
ter. It's been getting better.

Grade: B

Now, sometimes I may say
something I wish I hadn't. Late
last semester I reviewed CBS This
Morning and gave it a fairly lousy
grade.

I said something about how I
wished this program would find
its own identity. Well, guess
what? It did.

The CBS News morning fare is
hardly humdrum anymore and
has, since its inception, become
a hip show. Where else on the
screen do you see Harry Smith,
Kathleen Sullivan and Robert
Krulwich playing a crossword
puzzle about the Iowa caucuses?

On what other program do you
spend 20 full minutes of live tel-
evision every Friday morning in
the home of someone like Sidney
Sheldon or Julie and David
Eisenhower?

New Grade: A

See you in two weeks.

By Don Boyd

Staff Writer

The Pitt men's track team trav-
els to Syracuse University this
weekend for the Big East Indoor
Track and Field Championships.
Pitt coach John Vasvary feels his
team will be in the running.

”We have a good shot at the
championship," said Vasvary.

Pitt returns three defending
champions to the meet. Lee
McRae will defend his 55-meter
dash title as well as compete in
the 300-meter run. In the
800-meter run, Dave Moore will
be out to repeat while Eric Can-
non pursues another 55—meter

hurdles title.

Several athletes may play a cru-
cial role in the championships.
Seniors George lfill (hurdles and
long jump) and Calvin Holmes
(hurdles and relays) as well as
freshman standout Elbert Ellis
(hurdles,400-meter run and re-
lays) will be looked to for strong
performances.

All-American linebacker Zeke
Gadson will be running in the
55-meter run. As Vasvary noted,
”He won't have have to hit any-
one in this event, but maybe we
will tell him there is a quarter-
back at the finish line.”

The Panthers have several
other standouts participating in

Team effort gives Pitt
impressive 76-64 win

By Matt Martin
Assistant Sports Editor

All five Lady Panther starters
scored in double figures as Pitt
defeated Georgetown 74-62 in a
Big East basketball game last
night at Fitzgerald Field House.

Freshman Lorri Johnson paced
Pitt, 11-13 and 3-10 in the con-
ference, with 20 points and a
game-high 12 rebounds while
junior Deidra Baker scored 14
points and senior Sally Sheerer
added 12.

Junior Denise Becher and
sophomore Jennifer Shingler
scored 10 points each for Pitt.

League scoring leader Beth
Knight led the Hoyas (7-17, 3-10)
with 25 points.

’’In terms of where were head-
ed, this was [the most important
victory of the season]/’ Lady Pan-
ther head coach Kirk Bruce said.

Pitt moved from ninth (last
place in the Big East) into an
eighth place tie with Geor-
getown.

Should Pitt continue winning
and move into seventh place,
they will be guaranteed a berth
against the second place team in
the league in the upcoming Big
East Championship Tournament.

The Lady Panthers were down
18-12 with 11:13 left to play in
the first half, but went on a 27-8
run capped by a Sheerer
3-pointer at the buzzer to take a
39-26 halftime lead.

The Hoyas came out on fire in
the second half, though, using a
12-4 spurt to cut Pitt's lead to
43-38 five minutes into the half.

Pitt fought back as Johnson
scored six of the Lady Panthers’
next 10 points for a 53-44 lead.

Georgetown got no closer than
seven points the rest of the way.

”The key to this game was
Denise Becher,” Bruce said of his
starting point guard. ”She was un-
der control and her perimeter
shooting was great."

Becher hit a 3-pointer with
4:55 remaining to give Pitt a 13
point lead, 66-53. Becher also
handed out a team-high five
assists.

The Hoyas’ Jill Cook led both
teams with seven assists.

One of the few things that kept
Georgetown in the game was
their foul shooting. Pitt commit-
ted 25 personal fouls in the game,
15 in the second half. The Hoyas
connected on 15 of 20 free

throws.
Bruce was disappointed with
the foul situation. ”You foul

when you’re behind. if you're
losing, you want to stop the
clock.”

But Pitt wasn't losing, and it
could have cost them the game
on any other night.

The Lady Panthers shot 50.9
percent from the field, 55.2 in the
first half, to hold off any poten-
tial Hoya run.

Georgetown shot 45.4 percent
from the field for the game.

Pitt next travels to Jamaica, NY

run. Last year, as newcomers to
the Panthers, Friedrich and
Rhines picked up crucial points
for the Panthers in the Big East In-
door Championships as Pitt
edged Georgetown by 1‘/2 points
to claim the team title.

For Vasvary, the Big East Indoor
Track and Field Championships
is one of three times during the
year when he wants his charges
to pull out all the stops (the other
times being the cross-country
championships and the Big East
Outdoor Championships).

’’It is time for us to roll the
sleeves up and dig in. Times are
thrown out the window. What's

important is the place you finish.
In this meet, you can't give up
just because you are not running
your best time; you give up and
you hurt the team,” said Vasvary.

Vasvary expects his team's
strongest competition to come
from Georgetown and Syracuse.
”Georgetown has several strong
field competitors as does Syra-
cuse, which has the home track
advantage,” he added.

For Pitt to win, it is essential the
Panthers get a strong perfor-
mance on the track. While Geor-
getown and Syracuse are strong
in the field events, the Panther’s
lone field entrant is long jumper
George lfill.

Marshall Clork/The Pitt News 
Freshman Lorri Johnson's 20 points and 12 rebounds led Pitt over Georgetown last night.

Wrestlers prepare for struggling Clarion

By Vince Carey

Assistant Sports Editor

For years, Clarion University
has been known for their
wrestling program. Last season,
they finished 5-1 in the Eastern
Wrestling League and 14-6
overall.

But the story has changed this
season.

The Golden Eagles are mud-
dling through a disappointing 0-4

Anya-1s1.nA.aAoa-A-vvi-""--‘*l""“"“"

EWL season, 3-10 overall.

Clarion visits Fitzgerald Field
House Saturday night to square
off agianst the Panthers.

Pitt is 7-5-1 overall and 1-3 in
the EWL.

"Don't let their record deceive
you, they are still a tough team to
beat,” Pitt coach Rande Stott-
lemyer said.

Pitt has lost three starters in the
last couple of matches, and will
go at the Golden Eagles with a

depleted lineup.

Last Wednesday against Kent
State, 1 77-pounder Mike Tongel
was lost for the season with an
ankle injury.

Last Sunday, one of Pitt's most
impressive wrestlers so far this
season, Dave Ciafre was lost with
a knee injury against Penn State.

”With the way our lineup is
now, it should be interesting,”
Stottlemyer said. ”Losing those
guys will undoubtedly hurt us.

But I am confident that whoever
we put in there will do a good
job."

One thing that will stay the
same will be All-American Pat
Santoro (38-0) in the 142-pound
slot. Santoro is currently ranked
No. 1 in the country in his weight
class.

”[Clarion] may be down a lit-
tle bit this year, but it is not go-
ing to be easy,” Santoro said.

”With all of our injuries, it's go-
ing to take a total team effort to
win. I hope we can pull it of.”

The Panthers have also hit hard
times of late, losing their last
three meets, but they are still
ranked No. 18 by the Amateur
Wrestling News. ’

This is the last home meet for
the Panthers. They finish out the
regular season at West Virginia
next Thursday.

Depth and experience

key to women ’s trac

By Don Boyd
Staff Writer

The Pitt women's track team
participates in the Big East indoor
Track and Field Championships
at Syracuse University this

-weekend. The Lady Panthers can

be best categorized as an up—and—
coming team.

Pitt head coach Steve Lewis
feels his young team (only three
seniors) is headed in the right
direction. ’’I think our main
strength this year is having team
depth from top to bottom in 12
events. We have quality people
in all 12 events, and we feel we
have someone on our team who
could finish in the top three spots
in the conference in each event,”
observed Lewis.

Lewis feels the five juniors on
his team (his first Pitt recruiting
class) provide a strong leadership
base.

”Gloria Azeke, Pat Cupid,
Hannah Russell, Debbie Banner

and Luanne Harris have been and
will continue to be the leaders.
We do everything off of what
these five athletes do. These peo-
ple will do everything they are
capable of doing, the rest of the
team is variable,” said Lewis.

Lewis feels the sophomores
and freshmen are ready to give a
strong account of themselves.
”The sophomores are going to
the Big East for the second time
around, and we know they are
going to do a good job. The fresh-
men have been super,” said
Lewis.

As far as his team's perfor-
mance in the championship,
Lewis had this to say: "Nobody
knows but us what we will ac—
complish. We have a young
team. The defending champs, \_/il-
lanova, will field a strong team.
They are a tough, classy, well—
experienced team. The only ad-
vantage we may have over them
is depth.”
