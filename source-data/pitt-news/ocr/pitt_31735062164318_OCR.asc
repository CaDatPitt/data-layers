Sen. Douglas Attacks

Goldwater; Campaigns
For Johnson, Blatt

By JACK! KATZ
Amidst spontaneous applause from approximately 300
students, Paul Douglas, senior senator from Illinois, un-
leashed an acrimonious attack against the Republican pres-
dential candidate, Barry Goldwater, Monday in the SU Sup-

per Room.

“The Democratic party is a party of hope and its purpose is to
appeal to youth,” the senator pointed out. “The Republican party,
however, is a party of memory and this year’s memories are faultier
than ever.”

Senator Douglas asserted that
the Republican candidate is
vague, inconsistent, and irra-
tional. “He proceeds on a day
to day contradictory basis; he
says one thing one day and
practically contradicts it the
next day.”

For example, Goldwater one
day claimed that the function of
the president is to reduce crime,
but deﬁnitely not through nation-
al police force. Yet another day,
he said that if crime becomes
bad enough, the U.S. should have
a national police force. And still
a third day he declared that the
president should not use the Ma-
rines or a national police force,
but should reduce crime in Wash-
ington, D. C., by setting a good
example.

“With his View of reducinx
crime. Goldwater should ‘Look
Homeward Angel " Senator
Douglas exclaimed. “Phoenix,
Arizona, has the fourth highest
crime‘ rate in the nation, sur-
passed only by Las Vegas, Los
Anzeles, and Miami.

he said that if elected he would enforce the bill. Think how he would
enforce it. How active do you think the Attorney Gene;-a1 woum be
under him?”

Senator Douglas posed three fundamental questions that he
feels every voter should ask himself: “Whose ﬁnger do you want
near the nuclear button, Johnson’s or Goldwater’s? When the
telephone rings on the hot line, whom do you want to answer it,
Johnson or Goldwater? If something should happen to the presi-
dent, whom do you want to step into his shoes, Hlnnphrey or
Miller?”

.“You have a choice, you and your parents have a very serious
choice to make. And when you vote for Johnson, give him a Congress
and Senate that will work with him, and that means elect Geneveive
Blatt to the U.S. Senate.”

J ohnson’s Warmth Appeals
To SG Leader John Vrana

Student Government President John
Vrana met United States President Lyn-
don Johnson at the White House last Sat-
urday and literally felt right at home.

“The thing that impressed me,” said
Vrana, “was the friendliness and warmth that
the top leaders of our government expressed to
the students, and the feeling that the White
House belongs to all the people.”

After opening remarks by Secretary of State
Dean Rush, Secretary of Defense Robert Mc-
Namara, and Secretary of Labor Willard Wirtz
concerning current policy and rationale, J ohn-
son spoke for about 20 minutes to the 100 student
leaders from throughout the nation.

Salutes Students

The President saluted the students and urged
them to greater participation in‘ government af-
fairs. “Able leaders, whether the Republican,
Theodore Roosevelt, or the Democrat, Woodrow
Wilson,” said Johnson, “pointed to the bedrock
fact: In an increasingly complex nation, greater
activity of government and more social-minded
attitudes of all private institutions were needed
to protect the genuine freedom of the individual.”

He said the real message was that a genuine
free society cannot be a spectator society. To
this ‘end, Johnson announced a program of 15
White House Fellows who will gain ﬁrst hand
experience in the government by being assigned
to Cabinet and White House staff members.

Vrana said he was particularly impressed
with the respect shown President Johnson by
members of the Cabinet. Said Vrana, “When I
heard Mr. McNamara say ‘Good afternoon, Mr.
President,’ this amount of respect from one man
to another made me visualize the tremendous im-
portance of the head of state.”

‘Meets Johnson

When the President concluded his address
in the East Room, the students were received in
the Red Room where Vrana met and greeted the
Chief Executive. He extended greetings from
Chancellor Litchﬁeld and himself and was thank-
ed by the President. Afterwards, Vrana met Mrs.
Johnson and Lynda Bird.

. Following a buffet dinner of sea food, the
students toured the White House and were
entertained by Willis Connover, head of the
jazz program for Voice of America. the Chad
Mitchell Trio, Bob Newhart, and the Stan Getz
Quartet.

ciates and under its patronage

land.

Conservative Fulton Lewis, III debated liberal Dr. James Burk-

hart on current election issues, before less than a capacity crowd,
Monday in the SU' supper room. Each argued their positions around a
“big” government versus “small” government principle.
, Lewis, ﬁeld director of the Young Americans for Freedom, stated
in opening, “The Democrats, in attempting to put a ﬂoor on disaster
through government action, have succeeded in putting a ceiling on
opportunity.”

Lewis compared the present times with those of the thirties. He
said that the government then held “peculiar” power to maintain
the status quo, even though it was a step backward. Lewis cited the
proposed conservation. corps and Secretary of Agriculture Orville
Freeman’s pending farm bill as two present day attempts to extend
federal power into everyone’s lives.

Dr. James Burkhart, professor of political science at Stephens
College in Colombia, Missouri, explained that liberalism, as opposed

wrong three times recently. “The Democrats may have the pollsters
and the press,” he contended, “but we have the hearts of the Ameri-

His conﬁdence was echoed by his younger brother, -Mike, and by

Segan Writes Spring Term Paper;

Becomes Lo

By FRANK

When senior Alan Segan
"ﬁnished typing his term pa-
per for an urban political
systems course late one night
last April, he had no idea it
would lead to an unusual job in
the city’s planning department.

His professor, Dr. Matthew
Holden, was impressed with Se-
gan’s work and with the paper,
titled “Zoning as a Political In-
strument: The Mount Lebanon
Township Church Dispute,” which
discussed how a zoning dispute

is handled in a suburban corn- . 

munity.

In May, while /working .at one
of the Brass Rail restaurants at
the World’s Fair, Segan received
a letter from Dr. Holden saying
that he had arranged for Segan
to work for Pittsburgh’s Com-
munity Renewal Program (CRP)
for ten weeks beginning June 1.
Segan is one of the few, Univer-
sity students ever to be offered
a job like this.

Works with City's Codes

Segan, who plans to work in
city planning after he graduates

from law school, spent the rest

of the summer doing research on

to present proposals for long

Speciﬁcally. Segan studied
data gathered in Oakland and
the Perry-Hill top area and
tried to ﬁnd methods for de-

funds granted by the Seasongood
Foundation, a foundation inter-

at the University. The money
was provided speciﬁcally to em-

President Johnson has shown astute psychological insight in his

pation—-full, zestful, knowledgeable participation.”

To this end, he structured a program of 15 White House Fellows
serving for 15 months .as assistants to the vice-president, each Cabinet
officer, and four members of the White House staff. A select committee
‘ ' wﬂl choose the group of men and women, from ages 23 to 35, from busi-
ness, law, journalism, the universities, architecture, etc. Johnson specified,
“Each will have demonstrated high moral character, exceptional ability,
marked leadership qualities, and unusual promise of future development.”

Such a program will prime this crop of college graduates in an un-

  Barry’s Policies Probed

By ALLAN SCHLOSSER

One of the major issues
of the 1964 Presidential
campaign, and indeed the
cause of much consternation
in European capitals, has
been Senator Goldwater's
conception of our role in
internation-
al. relations.
This contro-
versy stems
from the Sen-
ator’s insist-
ence u p o n
questioning
the most fun-
‘ - damental ten-
SCIILOSSEB ets of Ameri-
- can foreign policy.

    

"If there is one central
premise underlying Barry
Goldwater’s philosophy of
foreign affairs, it is that
the Communist nations con-
stitute a political monolith
and that this bloc is dedi-
cated to the destruction of
both the United States and
the entire free world. Given
these conditions, the sena-
tor then argues that the
United States has but one
policy alternative: Firm
committment to that which
he loosely labels “total vic-
tory.”

THE REPUBLICAN
“love feast,” held in the
month of August at Her-
shey, did not signi:t‘i‘cant1y
dispel the doubts about
Goldwater’s positions on the

" crucial questions of Ameri-

can foreign policy. The sen-
ator, .who in his Conscience
of a Conservative believed
that involvement in the
United Nations was ‘fan un-
constitutional surrender of

American‘ sovereignty,” had _

suddenly become a strong
proponent of multilateral
diplomacy. And the senator,
who supported a scant twen-
ty-six per cent of President
Eisenhower’s foreign poli'cy
recommendations, had now
become the number-one dis-
ciple of the Eisenhower-
Dulles policies.

Barry Goldwater, lest
we forget, is the man who
in his writings warns us not
to enter any negotiations
with the Soviet Union; who

I is unalterably opposed not

only to disarmament but to

 all research in the area’ of
_ who advo- ‘ Gm“.
 a continuation! of nu-.—..? . cm,

disarmament ;_

of the precautions taken
against secret explosions;
who proposes that the Unit-
ed States use diplomatic
recognition as a lever v'is-a-
vis the Soviet Union; who
views the cultural exchange
program as “an operation
in Communist political war-
fare; who speaks of defoli-
ating the jungles of South
Viet Nam; who wants to
send the U. S. Marine Corps
into Cuba at the slightest
provocation; who insists
upon prompt termination of
economic aid to foreign
countries; who describes the
Peace Corps as a “haven for
beatniks _and draft dodg-
ers;” who distrusts negoti-
ation, be it at the United
Nations or in Geneva; and
who suggest that military
commanders in the field be
given control over tactical
nuclear weapons.

WITH THE kind of .a
record it is understandable
that the junior senator from
Arizona has become the
messiah of the American
right-wing. Like so many
rightists, Barry Goldwater
has been philosophically
and psychologically unable
to adjust to the realities of
present East-West relations.

He is unwilling to accept
the fact ‘that reasonable
statesmen are guiding us
toward a detente wi'th the
Soviet Union, based not up-
on submission or less ade-
quate national security, but

rather upon strength and
sanity. Thus, the nuclear
test-ban treaty, the agree-
ment on fissionable mater-
ials, and the so-called “hot
line” are tangible products

enhower years as well.

The Democratic Party,
however, realizing that lay-
ing a foundation for a last-
ing peace is integral to our
national “security, has ap-
pealed to the vastmajority
of the American people who
reject bellicose and irrespon-
sible suggestions. If there is
a miscalculation in the Gold-
water strategy— and there
are probably many of them
—it is this attempt to con-
vert moderate voters to the
Goldwater gospel of viru-
lent anti-Communism.

ONE FEARS that Barry
Goldwater, surrounded only
by his own zealots, has seri-
ously misread the pulse of
American public opinion.
Thus, .When he accuses Pres-
ident Johnson of being “soft
on Communism,” one cannot
help feeling sorry for a man
who longs for days when
McCarthyist tactics were
the vogue.

Desperation pervades the
Goldwater-Miller camp as
the election draws near.
There is not a single key
state upon which the Re-
publican Party of Barry
Goldwater can count. The
Grand Old Party, now re-
duced to a coalition of re-
actionaries and segregation-

ists, is bracing itself for a
cold November. ‘

ment to forget only mouth democratic platitudes. But Johnson has rein-
forced the democratic ideal and in return will get a core of enthusiastic,
knowledgeable minds to stimulate as well as to learn, not to mention pro-
viding the basis of future political leadership.

As our own University administration has seen over the past few
years, a governing complex gets more loyalty, more strength, when its
populace is encouraged to participate in top level affairs. And J ohnson’s
White House fellows decidedly promulgates this ideal.

Letters To

Classroom Conduct Called
Disappointing by Coed

Editor, The Pitt News:

Perhaps since I am a “prep-
school” product, my views on de-

Vportment are too strict to be ap-

plied in the college experience;
but I must say that I am ex-
tremely disgusted and most dis-
appointed by the blatant lack of
respect shown by my fellow stu-
dents on several occasions. Per-
mit me to list a few of the of-
fenses that I have recently ob-
served in one of my lecture
classes:

1. One day during the lecture,
six people walked out at various
intervals.

2. Throughout the period there
is constant derogatory chattering
and giggling and regular shout-
ing to the friend nine or ten
seats away. The noise is such
that I ﬁnd it difficult to hear
what the professor is saying.

3. The raucous guffaws at the
professor's attempts at sincerity
are disgraceful. .Once when he
was explaining the grading sys-
tem and the fact that we were
not required to come to class, I
thought I was in a brothel, so
great was the pandemonium that
ensued.

.4. Booingw: and-shissing is 3not>-=
~  -3.-is — = 

   
  
    
 
 

each class ends there is a bois-
terous round of book-slamming,
feet-shuffling, and paper-rattling,
so that the professor is usually
forced to stop his lecture in the

I middle of a sentence and dismiss

the class.

6. The crowning glory, how-
ever, occured only a few days
ago, when a well-aimed spit-ball
struck the professor’s suit coat.

I realize that the professor
lacks» dramatic training and that
his lectures do not compare with
Burton's Hamlet, however, the
students in «this course (supposed-
ly) are here to learn, a pheno-
menon which I feel sure would
occur were they more attentive.
Certainly the man deserves some
esteem for trying to teach his
stubborn students despite the im-
possible odds. The students’ at-
titude has degenerated to “how
lucky you are, professor, to have
us in your class” (which is far
from the truth).

I know the new environment
of college demands some outlet
for security, but perhaps the of-
fenders could ﬁnd another less

disturbing means and let those
who appreciate the opportunities

TEMPERED OPTIMISM
MANY FOOTBALL fans are excited about the perform-
, ance of the Panther backs last Saturday against William

- and Mary. We’re not. Remember that the Panthers
played William and Mary, a weak, inexperienced, and
light, team. It was not Syracuse that they defeated,
but William and Mary.

The Panthers scored fewer points. against Wil-
liam and Mary this year than they scored against
Syracuse last year. And remember, the Indians hel
the Panthers scoreless for the first quater. V

THIS IS NOT to say the Panthers did not play well

‘ against William and Mary. It is only toqsay that the win
’ A over the Indians is meaningless. The Panthers were
expected to win by better than 20 points. That they
covered the spot is no accomplishment. .

It's hard to understand why the Panthers treat-
ed visiting football scouts to a display of their of-
fensive Iwares on Saturday. The Panthers handled
William and Mary easily. They did not have to resort
to their double hand-off and pitch back to the quar-
terback. ‘

The play merely alerts scoutsfrom other schools
to the plays the Panthers are using this year.

WHEN ASKED why he used the ﬂashy play against the

Indians, coach John Michelosen explained that the Pan-

» thers used that play very often in past years, and
opponents knew they had the play.

Michelosen cited quarterback Ivan Toncic, who
ran the play almost perfectly, as an example. But
Toncic has not played here in almost a decade. Teams

. like West Virginia, which might have been vaguely
aware of the Panther play, have now been alerted to
it. It could easily backﬁre if the Panthers try it
against West Virginia this Saturday.

IT. SEEMS UNUSUAL to us that the Panthers hold

closed practice sessions during the week, and then unveil
a surprise play in a game that means nothing before
23 thousand fans. It makes about as much sense as
sending a visiting scout diagrammed plays and com-
plete play plans before a ball game. '

  
  
 
  
  
  

Runners  Revenge
 Against Penn State

The cross-country team hosts Penn State, one of the
1-_ roughest teams in the East, Saturday at Schenley Park.

The Lions raced past the Panthers, 19-41, last year.
State has seven lettermen returning from the 3-3 squad.
Heading Penn's monogramists is captain Dick Iampman, a
senior from Liverpool, N. Y., and
Chuck Leuthold, a junior from
_ Pittsburgh.

the top ﬁve against State last
year.

  Third su-mtg shows Promise}

 

Backs, Tackles, Impressive

Last Satucrday’s football game proved a couple of things
to the Panther fans. First, that William and Mary wasn’t
in the same class with the Panthers and second, that there
is a lot of talent on the Panther bench.

In the spring, backﬁeld coach Bimbo Cecconi was en-
thusiastic about his backs. “The young backs will be carry-
ing our second. and third backﬁelds,” he said. The second
and third teams got plenty of action against William and

Mary and the backs ‘did carry
the squad.

“Bob Dyer and Dewey Chester
did run very we ,” said coach
John Michelosen, “and I'd like
to use them more than I do. I
can't say how much they will
play from now on because" it all
depends on the situation, and
also the competition will be
tougher from now on.”

Since injuries put starting
tackles Ron Linaburg and Jim
Jones on the sidelines the tac-
kle position showed a lot of
inexperience. Michelosen, how-
ever, seemed satisﬁed with the
line play. ‘

Since‘ the second team was
playing often, third string tackles

Bob Guzinsky, Tom Raymond,
and John Schmidt had plenty of
contact. “They played well when
they were in but it's hard to tell
from a game like that,” Michelo-
sen said. '

Brian Generalovich also seems
to be making strides as a var-
sity ball player. “He looked
good on defense and made a
few real good plays,” Michelo-
sen said. “I’m still not sure if
I’m going to platoon him with
Howley at end yet.”

Another second _stringer im-
pressed Micheolosen. “Bob Soro-
chak played one of his best games
last Saturday, especially on of-
fense,” Michelosen said.

Mountaineers’ Ranks Depleted

Booters Seek Third Victory
Against Inexperienced W V U  

By BILL CABIN

Experience and conﬁdence will
be on the side of the soccer team
when they face West Virginia
University this Saturday at 10:00
a.m. at Forbes Field‘. Eight of
the Panther booters’ eleven start-
ers are lettermen, .and they have
four lettermen as alternates.

Vince Bartalotta and Sal Ta-
vares, two inside men, and Jim
Snyder, a halfback,‘ are all sopho-
mores and the the only starters
who have not lettered. Sam Don-
atelli and Joe Meyers are letter-
men who have been alternating

-. at the inside positions, while

Dom Millilo and Dave Shaffer,
who are also lettermen, will be
available at ‘goalie and back, re-
spectively.

“Our record is now 2-1,” said
coach Leo Bemis, “and although

' the West Chester loss was a key

game, the boys are still as conﬁ-

‘Mustachio’
Leads in Yogi

George “Mustachio” Lies storm-
ed into ﬁrst place in the Yogi
contest last week with an 11-2
record. Going into the second
weekend football action “Musta-
chio” trailed Bob “Sage” Smizik
by three games. But the Sage
stumbled last week with a 6-7
mark, one of the worst this year.

Marvin “Isaiah” Zelkowitz had
an 8-5 mark last week, gaining
two games on Smizik, although
he still trails Lies by three games.
“Lo,” quoth the soothsayer, “I
despaireth not. For behold, this
coming. weekend, whomsover I
picketh shall prosper. The ways
of the Yogi champion sometimes
seemeth strange, but ‘Mustachio’
shall still be scorched by the
ﬂames of my chariots.”

dent and united as they were
at the season's start. Last year
the booters defeated the Moun-
taineers, 4-0, with a team that
Bemis has said was not as good
as this year's.

The Mountaineers will be
plagued by inexperience. They
have only six returning letter-
men, and the remainder of the
squad has little varsity experi-
ence.“‘Although we are in good
physical condition and have a
faster team than in the past,
we are still basically an inex-
perienced team,” said West Vir-
ginia coach Sam_ Maurice.

Lettermen Mike Cicci, Joe Don-
digo, Marty Goldstein, Frank
Guenther, Oskar Schroeder, and
Gary Zoerner will form the nu-
cleus of the Mountaineer‘ squad.
Maurice will be starting sopho-

more Butch Rossi at center half-
back. “Rossi could possibly be
the best soccer player we’ve ever
had,” said Maurice.

Although the Mountainers won
their opener against Fairmont, it
was not an impressive victory.
“Fairmont is“ a team that our
freshmen usuallyécan bea ,” Be-
mis said. “West Virginia should
not be too hard a game, and it
will give us a chance. to-sharpen
our shooting for Howard.”
