SDS,PLP Protest

Racism Speaker

Harvard's Kilson

The University Senate's Tuesday
“Colloquium on Racism in the
Academy.” may be the scene of a
confrontation between several
University anti-racist groups and
Marti§.,Kilson of Harvard Univer-
sity. Kilson. a black administrator
at Harvard. will be on campus to
participate in the Colloquium's
panel discussion on racism.

A demonstration protesting of
Kilson and his presence at the
Colloquium is being organized by
‘Students for a Democratic /Society
(SDS) and the Progressive Labor
Party (PLP).

An SDS handout describes
Kilson, as a “black racist professor,
a key administration flunkey.” He
is accused of trying to reverse the
gains made by the civil rights
movement of the 60s.

Matt Schnierov. SDS president.
said it is a disgrace that Kilson has

been ‘asked to attend the Collo-'

quium._ Schnierov said Kilson's
presence “give him a credibility he
doesn't deserve."

The demonstrationiwill take the -

form of an informational picket line
composed of SDS and PLP
members, along with interested
students and faculty. ‘

Kilson will sit on a panel with
four other educators: Jerry Hirsch

can't say ‘l think this is what
students’ needs are‘ when they

really never asked what they
needed."
The first step in Furick's

proposed plan is to meet with the
Allocations Committee and request
a list of allocating priorities on
which appropriations are based
upon each year.

Once the list is compiled Furick
said he would “call together the
presidents of all the student
organizations and pass out copies
of
priorities.

“At this meeting we could get
input from all the student leaders,"
Furick explained. “Here we could

PHEAA Warns Action

On Unpaid State Loans

Failure to repay state academic
loans will be handled more severely
in the future. according to the
Pennsylvania Higher Education
Assistance Agency (PHEAA).

The Agency also announced that

‘students whose family's principal

wage earner dies while the student
is still in school will receive
ﬁnancial aid more readily.

The diligent pursuit of students
who default on loans is expected to
take the form of more personal and
telephone contact. Also, unpaid
accounts will be_reported to the
County Prothonotary' where the
delinquent borrower resides, to
record the unpaid loan with the
credit bureau serving the student’s
area and to pursue full legal action
on such accounts.

Concern over the‘ plight of
students whose family's principal
wage earner dies arose from a
number of such cases. '

“This is one area where we need
to give maximum service. partly
because of the confused ﬁnancial
picture immediately following the

death of the major wage earner."‘
said Kenneth Reeher. PHEAA
director. A 4

Such students will be processed as
though they have no income. The
result of this. unless the family has
high assets. is the student could
obtain a maximum State Higher
Education Grant to cover tuition—-
up to $l200 in-state. and $800 for
an out-of-state school.

PHEAA has also ruled
“financially independent"
unmarried applicants _who grad-
uated from high school at least six
years before. Such students would
be considered as emancipated from
their parents.

This change was made according
to PHEAA. because such appli-
cants are too old to be claimed as
dependents by parents‘ on federal
income tax forms. Other contri-
buting reasons were that the
normal college period has elapsed.
and age 22 or older was thought
appropriate to consider students as

get an idea of where the students
wanted to spend the money."

This could become only an
attempt to receive input, Furick
admitted, because there is a chance
each leader would only be vocal for
his own interest. Furick, who is
presently a SGB member, said he
would hope the ‘organization
presidents would be unselfish and
more responsible to the needs of
the general student population.

The priorities list compiled by
the Allocations Committee. and the
input received at the meeting with
student leaders would then be
collected. Furick said. and the new
incoming Allocations Committee
would use the information as a
guideline for the spring appropria-
lions.

"At least then we would have
something tangible to work with."
Furick explained. “What we have
now is a Student Government
giving out a lot of money with out
really keeping track of it."

“Last year the Board went into
the allocations (voting) kind of cold
and so something has to be set up
to push it into some direction."

Furick added.’“Programming is

another big thing l'dilikc to look

into." the explained that student
services. which include program-
ming. should be aimed towards the
individual student--“the guy who
doesn't belong to a club."--as
opposed to special interest groups.

stiffer a little bit." Furick said in

Adachi Vows Overhaul   
Of Student Government 

. BY RICHARD SWARTZ
Christina Adachi. one of the two
candidates for Student Government
president. has vowed to institute a
massive “restructuring, re-
organizing. democratizing" over-

haul of that student organization if‘\

elected. -
Promising a “radically different
program for qualitative change,"
Adachi intends to expand the
influence of Student Government
beyond the traditional confines of
the student body to the Administra-
tion and the community at-large.
“We of the Young Socialist
Alliance have a whole, different
concept of what Student Govern-
ment can'and should be,” Adachi
said. “The main ingredient would
be a reliance on the participation of
students of Pitt. We would
mobilize students around major
political issues that are facing them
today, transforming the University

, into an organizing center for social
change3’
Mass student action, with

Student Government co-ordinating
its operation, would be the
principal vehicle for accomplishing
the goals involved in changing the
University's character, according
to Adachi. »

“The University must develop a
concrete commitment to live up to
its social responsibilities in the
community," Adachi maintained.
“The students can have an active

tion to the community around it."
Adachi characterized the present
relationship as parasitic, with the
University extracting what it
requires in terms of property,
without returning any dividends.

Pitt Janitors, Local 29,  

May Strike iWednesday   

BY BILL HADUCK

The State Mediation Board has
been called in to settle a dispute
between the University and Union
Local 29 which includes the
University's janitors.
keepers. maids, and kitchen help.

A meeting was to be held today
at 10 am between union leaders.
University officials and the state
mediator. A

Joseph Dutton, Vice Chancellor
of Operations said “We are
optimistic that a satisfactory
settlement will be met.” He said,
however, he was “particularly
avoiding any specifics,” because,
“you don’t play poker with all your.
cards showing.”

house--

The dispute. if not settled. could

result in a strike by Local 29
Wednesday. .
A meeting was held last

Thursday concerning the Univer-
sity's offer of a 25 cent wage
increase this year, 20 cents next
year. and 20 cents in 1976, which
the union failed to ratify.

Asked if the union could get its
400 members together for ratiﬁca-
tion by the Wednesday strike
deadline, Dutton said, ‘.‘I don't
know that it can."

Dutton noted that some of the A

demands are unreasonable, but
added “We think the leadership is
trying to play it straight.”

Union leaders were unavailable

for comment.

monetarily. she feels. but the

, campus must also open its doors to
the local residents. An identifica-

tion with the University would
allow local residents to believe they
have a. personal stake in its
preservation.

“The formation of a group like
Peoples‘ Oakland is an indication of

0 '. how threatened the residents feel

about the University." Adachi
said.
“The library, the gyms, the

medical facilities, the educational

 . programs, and the Student Union
_ should all be made available to

them, and it is the students who
can pressure the Administration to
dismantle the barriers.”

The sole purpose for the
existence ofthe Administration lies
in its duty to serve the students and
faculty. Adachi contends. Its
powers have become dictatorial in

recent years, she claims, but
Student Government. representing
a unified front. could reverse the
trend. However, its allocations‘
procedure needs to be revamped.
she insists.

Adachi ridiculed the current
network of priorities, terming them
“distorted." The denial of funds
for the Young Socialist Alliance,
the Third World Peoples’ Coalition,
and the Ad Hoc Committee on
Chile, plus the funneling of $1200
into the purchase of Homecoming
visors particularly irritated her.
She believes every student or-
ganization deserves recognition
and funding, but feels evaluative
procedures must be revised.

"What I would do is require all
student organi‘/.ations to submit a
very detailed budgets, outlining
what they wanted to use the funds
for." she said. “I do consider
social events to be important. and if
elected. I would continue to
sponsor concerts and dances. But.
at the same time. Student
Government should also be edu-
cating students about the major
political issues of the day.

If an increased budget is needed
to finance additional activities,
Adachi feels the University should
be made to bear the burden. She
has advocated pressuring the
Administration into selling its
280,000 shares of Gulf Oil stock and
using the revenues to underwrite
both student and community

 

 

projects.

Too many students are laboring
under financial hardship. es-
pecially with the cutbacks in loans

and the escalation in tuition.
according to the presidential
candidate.

She stated her opposition to any .

further tuition hikes. citing the
pressing effects of past raises on
blacks and other minorities. In a
rclatedarea. Adachi insisted the
black studies department be
assured of adequate funding. Had
control of the department rested
with the black students and faculty.
rather than the Administration. the
fiasco which occurred last term
regarding its chairmanship could
have been averted. she believes.

Women students also figure
prominently in Adachi"s program.
which contains a five-point plat-
form.

‘‘I’m calling for an autonomous
women’s studies department, fully-
funded and staffed,” Adachi said.

“This would also include the
establishment ofa BA in this field.
Student Government would sup-
port sex discrimination cases
against women and the fair
representation of women al all
levels of University bodies.

"Free. quality child care for
students. faculty. and staff would
also be one of my priorities. along
with continuing the Health
Center's advice on abortion and
disbursement of contraceptives",

Pitt Prof.

BY DAVE MAJERNIK
When campus protests rocked
universities several years ago.
college students and professors

were exhorted to change the
government from within rather
than from without. One Pitt

professor is working from within to
change at least the city govern-
ment. He is James V. Cunningham
from the Graduate School of Social
Work, who is Executive Director of
the City of Pittsburgh Government
Study Commission.

The commission, comprised of 11
elected members, was created by
an act of the- state legislature in
1972 which mandated this group to
come up with improvements in the
present city government. Since
then, the commission has been
holding public hearings to find out
what governmental improvements
the people of Pittsburgh really
want. The citizens then vote on the
commission’s conclusions in a
referendum in either May or
November of 1974.

Cunningham. a veteran politician
who came to Pittsburgh from
Chicago as a neighborhood organ-
izer from Action Housing, has been

a full-time professor at Pitt since
1966. He is not an elected member
of the commission. but was
appointed bythe group to organize
the staff and oversee its secretariat
and research fuiictioiis.

“We're not trying to build a new
government." he explained. “but
to modernize an old government.
The present charter of the city
dates back to the nineteenth
century. It is a very complicated.
messy, difficult-to-get-at-constitu-
tion. The charter is an accretion of
acts of the state legislature. There

‘ was a basic reform in 1901. larger

revisions in 1911 and 1927, and’
additions. substractions. and var-
ious interpretations since then."

Cunningham claims the history of
Pittsburgh city government is
unique because many of its present
neighborhoods were formerly in-
dependent governments.

“The city of Pittsburgh is really a
metropolitan government because
many » neighboring boroughs,
townships and cities were annexed
to the city until the 1930's. Until
1911. as a municipality was
annexed, its council became a part
of City Council. Consequently, the

RESEARH  

Updating City Gov't.

Pittsburgh city council. which had a
lot of power, became a bicaineral
(two-house) body with'154 meni-
bers representing each neighbor-

- hood. The reform of 1911 wiped all

this out. changing citygovernment
to nine councilinen elected at-large
and a strong mayor. The emphasis
thus changed from one of decen-
tralization to that of great
ceintrali’/.ation."

One of the main objectives of the ~

government study commission,
according to Cunningham. is to
achieve “home rule" for Pitts-
burgh. '

“Home rule means that the city
can make its own decisions on
important matters,” he said. “The

present city government acts as a

subsidiary of the state government.
For example, the city cannot set up
a new agency or authority, or make
a major change in its tax structure
without permission from the state
legislature. When the mayor can

number one issue your campaign is
based on?

Hertneky: I would say the
important thing is raising the
academic standards here at the
University. My definition of

raising the academic standards is
that an individual (student) would
be prepared to take on whatever
tasks he might assume and that his
education be specific, yet. follow-
ing the guidelines of his specific
interests would call for flexibility.
Q: What mechanics would you
employ to achieve your goals?
Hertneky: Basically there are three
ideas here. One of the ways would
be through experiments in educa-
tion on which philosophies are
available. Another way is by
constantly keeping the faculty in
check lllrollgll evaluation.

Q: What would you do to insure a
valuable evaluation?

Hertneky: That is where the
Undergraduate Review comes in.
I'm on the Provost’s committee for
the bulletin. Here we are trying to
incorporate the time schedule. the
course description catalogue and
the UAR into one publication.
With the three together. students
can receive all the necessary
information more efficiently. But

14 students who
candidacy for Board are: Dan Cronin. Patricia Frod.
Susan Hayes. Mary Heider. Bob Heister. Paul
Hertneky. Pat Kablach. Bruce Keeler. Yaier Lehrer,
Robert Longwell, Nguyen Thi Kim Loan. Timothy C.
Patterson. Mark Satinoff. and Ruth Weinbrom.

because of the general ill feeling
among the faculty. we are going to
have to reorganize the UAR.

Q: Why do you feel that the
standard of education here needs
upgraded --why is that an issue?
Hertneky: I think we have run into
the problem of students needing a
graduate degree to get a good job.
Now we are at the point where we
have to keep this from becoming a
major problem.

Bruce
Keeler

Question: What is the main issue
your platform stands on?

1‘ _ Keeler: The way I see it. Student

Government does not really want
students involved. The Greeks
around here control things. A
student with a complaint has to go
up there and scream and holler
before anything is done. It
shouldn't have to be that way. I

can't see how they are our
representatives if they are not
concerned with what we are

thinking.

Q: With that in mind, what are the
specific ‘problems you are now
concerned with as a potential
Student Government member?
Keeler: Well. remunerations is
onething. ldon't think that Sharon
Sexton (the editor of the Pitt News)
and the seven Board members
should get remunerated. They
should know how much work and
time it takes before
involved. Why aren't Pitt News
reporters and Eureka! people
remunerated? This remuneration
of $l5.000_ is five per cent of the
student activities money and
should be allocated towards a lot
better things.

Q: And what is the second point?
Keeler: The second idea is to find
out what the‘ students want their
money. the activities fee, spent on.
With them (the present Board) not
knowing what the students think.
it's impossible for them to know
what the students want in
programming and services.

Q: How would you find out what
the students want?

Keeler: By physically going out
and talking to the people. The
Board should be going out
periodically and random sampling
maybe two or five per cent of the
students to find out their opinion on
the issues.

Nguyen Thi
  Kim Loan

Question: What have you chosen

as the primary issue in your race
for the Board?

Loan: Right now, I think there are
many things missing from Student
Government. Student Government
never publicizes what it is doing
and students wonder. “What is

going on?” Also I feel there is no
continuity from one year to the
next. One Student Government
starts one thing and a new
Government starts another.

I want to see the old Board come
in and talk with the new Board so
they can know what's being
planned. I also think departments

' and organizations should be invited

to come to the office and discuss
their problems with us and tell us
how much money they need.

Q: Do you feel the present SG
budget is adequate and is it
properly dispensed?

Loan: I think the budget is large
enough. We should be putting
money into intramurals. because I
believe there are more students
who are involved in intramurals
than athletics. I

I also feel there should be more
special programming for engineers
and nurses. These students are
very busy during the week. and
often their schedules don't permit
them to attend many of the movies
and that are normally
held.

concerts

Engineers do have one special
week. but what about the rest of

the year? Nurses should also
receive more attention.
Q: What is your stance on the
construction of a new Student
Union? Is it needed?
Loan: 1 think there is not enough

room for all the organizations in-

this building. I would like to see a
larger one built eventually.

Q: How would it be funded?
Should students contribute?

Loan: We cannot get the money for

, it overnight. I would like to see the

University contribute part of the
money and ask the student body to
give another part. Tuition is very
high so we cannot ask the students
to contribute $10 or $12 each year.
We do have an alumni organization
who could be asked to donate the
extra amount needed.

Q: What is your conception of
Student Government? L
Loan: Student Government is here
to work for all the students. It is

here to solve problems that the
students have. to talk with them,
and to help them.

This should be the week to

remember for Buzz Ridl and the
Pill Basketball squad.

After being denied nationally
ranking last week. the Pitt cagers
rolled to their twelfth consecutive
victory over Duke. 62-46. Saturday
night before the largest crowd
(6200-plus) ever to pack the
Fitzgerald Fieldhouse.

It really wasn’t much of a classy
exhibition by the Pitt squad, but

"when it comes time to hand out the

honors for the nation’s top twenty
teams, the score is about the only
thing that will be remembered.
“We went in spurts offen-
sively." Ridl remarked after the
“but the team stayed on top

Well the Pitt Gymnastics team
pulled a similar stunt against Penn
Trees Hall

the best Gymnastics performance

.‘_bya Pitt team in at least three
’ years and the team's hope for the

immediate future now seems a lot
brighter.

The Gyiiiiiasts. led by first year
coach lg Perez. proved they were

 good con-artists and passed the

ultimate test for con-men. They

("conned themselves--into perforni-

ing much better than anyone had
expected. _ ‘-

Freshman all-around man Robert
Pasterick participated in the annual
team coii-job--Perez calls it
“Psyche-up"--and added a little
extra iiiiiiiagiiiative flair of his own
on his way to scoring 44.75 total

points. which was good enough to,

give him third place in the
all-around scoring.

“I went into the meet relaxed,”
a reporter-shy and now tense
Pasteriek noted. “I tried to make
myself believe that I was at the
same level of performance that
they were. I told myself that I was
on the same floor as they were’ and
that I could compete along side
them. It worked.”

Pasterick. whom Perez considers
perhaps his most advanced fresh-
man all-around man. was outscored
only by Bob Kruest (54.20) and Al
Jtiliaiio (51.00). both Penn Staters.
and managed to take second places
in the floor exercise (8.50) and in
vaulting (9.10). I —

Perez was impressed. “Today
was a trial of fire for Rob." the
coach noted. “He really pulled
through. He's really going to go on
from here."

Pasterick couldn't agree more.
“I've got confidence now. There’s
no reason I can’t do just as well
from now on and with work on

some of my other routines I feel I
can improve. This was the meet.

liiiiiiediate improvement could
come for Pasterick in the January
26th Tri-meet (Temple. Slippery
Rock. and Pitt). also“ scheduled -for
Trees Hall. with the addition of a
very difficult trick into his floor
exercise routine. He does a back
layout with a double twist, but was
forced to eliminate it against .Penn

"State because of a bad ankle,
«suffered doing that trick against

Springﬁeld College.

Not only did Pasterick perform
well, but the whole team seemed to
pick up the spark. In fact, had Don
Stevenson been able to perform--a
bad shoulder
participate in only two events--and
with a little more luck here or

there, Perez’s men could have v

scored in the 140's.

“The odds of us beating Penn
State were invincible Perez noted
after the meet. “I told the guys to
go out there. be loose. and try to
improve on their former scores.
They responded well. Ashley
Montague once said ‘judge a man
not against other. but against his
former self'." Perez continued.
“That's what they did."

Ashley Montague was probably a
good con-man.

.Despite a month layoff over
Christmas. the Pitt Track team got
off on the right foot winning the
mile relay and finishing a close
second in the two-niiler at the
Maryland CYO liivitatioiial Friday.

Milers Dan Betterley. Jack
Patrick. Rich Weaver, and Chuck
Mozingo started out with a fast
pace taking’ an early lead which
they never game up ﬁnishing
ahead of Virginia.’ Morgan State,
and Virginia State with a 3:22 time.
In the two-niile. the tracksters

again took an early lead followed by
Florida. Tennessee. Catholic Un-
iversity and St. Johns. Rick
Marklcy led off setting a steady
pace followed by Bob Steele and
Rick Jackson. Anchorman Bob
Moore took the baton and kept Pitt
in the lead until an unfortunate
accident took place. A Florida man
and Moore became entangled with
Moore falling hard.

The fall cost Bob his rhythm as he
couldn't regain the lead. Florida

Kirk Bruce hit from 22 feet to
give Pitt a 12-10 lead with 12:04 left-
in the first half and the Cats never

let the Blue Devils overtake them. .

With five and a half minutes to
play. Duke pulled to within a point
at 23-22. but the Panthers quickly
developed hot hands and took a
31-23 lead into the locker room at
halftime.

Once again it was Pitt’s All
American candidate Bill Knight
leading the Panthers with 18
points, eight for 17 from the field
and two for two at the charity
stripe. Knight also pulled down 14
rebounds, tops for the night of both
sides.

The Panthers shot 49 per cent in
tliefrst half with Knight getting 11
of his 18 points. The Blue Devils,
however. were consistantly riddled
‘by Pitt's defense and could manage
only a 25 per cent average. Chris
Redding led the Duke shooters with
25 points. 15 in the first half. The
6-10 senior worked wellunder the
boards along with teammate Bob
Fleischer. a 6-8 junior. Fleischer
pulled down 10 rebounds but could
only hit for eight points on the
night. Redding ﬁnished the game
nine rebounds.

Tom Richards followed Knight
with 1] points while Kirk Bruce
connected for nine. Senior Mickey
Martin grabbed eight reboundsin
an extremely physically game while
scoring seven points.

The Panthers exchanged baskets
with the Blue Devils for the first
three minutes of the second half to
keep a 37-30 lead but after that-
Duke continued to lose ground.
Knight,. Richards and Martin
connected‘ in succession to give Pitt
a 43-30 margin as the Cats started
to pull away.

That 13 point cushion was never
really seriously threatened and
with 7:50 left in the game the Cats

unanswered points. two of thos
coming on a technical foul assesed
on Duke coach Neill McGealiy.

With five minutes left and Pitt
holding a commanding 59-42 lead.
McGealiy conceded the game and
both sides sent in fresh substitutes.

“Actually, we didn’t play a good
game team-wise,” Martin said.
“It was really a physical game
inside.”

Despite the fact it wasn't
picture-perfect playing, a win over
a tough ACC school sliouldopeii a

Skaters Blast l/innies

BY G.W. STEVENS

The St. Vincent hockey club
hasn't faired too well thus far in
WPIHA play. They are currently'
holding down the doormat position
as the only winless team in the
league. As expected. they were
unable to capitalize on their only
opportunity to win a game on the
Civic Arena ice Satruday afternoon
as they were thoroughly pounded
by the Pitt Hockey Club. 8-1.

This was the second meeting this _

year between the two teams with
the Panthers gaining an 8-3 victory
in the first meeting. The second
game was so oiie-sided that at
times it got to be a little boring for
the 500 spectators. most of whom
were cheering for the Panthers.
The Pitt squad came out_ flying in
the first period controlling the
game completely. while firing a
total of 22 shots towards the St.
Vincent nets. Vinnie goalie Ken
Glinka was not quite equal to task

. as Pitt grabbed a 1-0 lead early in

the period. The goal came off of

the stick of Denny Browne when he I

picked up the rebound of Bob
Arturo‘s shot and slammed it into
the net. -

The Panthers continued to
pressure Glinka and were finally
able to add two more goals near the
end of the period. The first came

duringa wild s_craml_).le in_front_of.

the St. Vincent net. G’r‘eg‘Mintiz
was finally able to put the puck in

the net but was ‘hit hard fromi

behind and found himselfvsitting on
the puck in the Vinnie goal.

Less than a minute later, Joe
Testa made the score 3-0 with
another rebound shot ‘that left
Glinka flopping on the ice.

The second period was quite
similar to the first iwith the
Panthers adding five more easy
goals. Browne got his second goal
early in the period with an assist
going to Testa. Soon after that.
Glenn Hyde made his presence felt
as he lifted a shorthanded goal past
the shell-shocked goalie. Mintz.
Arturo. and John Fiiiiiey rounded
out the Panther scoring as they
added three quick goals near the
end of the period.

The Pitt skaters continued to
control the game in the third period
but Glinka was able to handle all of
the 20 shots he faced. Neverthe-
less. Pitt goalie Mark Lieberman
was unable to nail down his first
league shutout. Larry Hoenfield
got the only Vinnie goal midway
through the period when he icked
up a loose puck and skated in alone
on the defenseless Liebernian.

The win Saturday boosts the
Panthers record to 4-1 in league
play. leaving them just two points

Swimmers Nipped In   Final Event

BY YAIER LEHRER

In a Inect that saw the entire
contest rest on the final 400 yard
free-style relay last Saturday. the
Panther swimmers came out on the
short end of a 63-50 score against a
tough Bucknell team.

The score was 56-50 in favor of
the Bisons into the final event and
the seven points for winning that
event would have given the win to
either team. Coach Bradshaw sent
in John Seeppncr. Dave Simeone.
Mike McSwain. and Eric Wallace
to win the meet. but the
l’ree-stylers could not overcome the
strength of the Bucknell relay
squad and fell short of victory.

The Panthers really wanted to
win this meet. their first one of the
season. The whole team had been
getting psyched up since the start
of practice last term.

“Psyched,” said Coach Al
Coffey before the meet, “Isn’t the
word for it. It’s more like we’re out
of our skulls.”

The Cats got off to a good start.
winning the first two events. The
team of Mark Walllace. John
Templin. Dave Natali, and Carlos
Santiago ran away _ with the
400-yard medley relay, copping

that one by seven seconds.

Jerry Demuro and Walt Young,
both freshmen. captured first and
second places. respectively. with
Demuro breaking his own team
With

record by eleven seconds.

these two quick wins the Panthers
jumped to a 15-1 lead.

After these two events, however
the team could only put together
one more first place and had to
settle for seconds and thirds for the

"rest of the meet.

John Templin picked up the only
other first place for the Pitt team.
just nosing out Ed Johnson of
Bucknell in the 200 yard breast
stroke. The rest of the meet was
dominated by the Bisons. I

In both diving events, Bob
Richards of Buclmell captured the
top sports. In both events the Pitt
divers picked up second and third
place.

In the one meter board Jack
Garrow picked up second place
while Tom Faytol. a highly
regarded prospect for the Olym-
pics. copped a third. In the three
meter event.-I-lector Bass. who in
the beginning of March will
represent Puerto Rico in the
Central American games along
with five other Pitt swimmers,
picked up second place in his first
college meet. Garrow placed in the
event also with a third.

"This is a very young team,"
said Coach Bradshaw Of his almost
entirely freshman and sophomore
team. “but they have matured a lot
faster than I expected. Why in this
meet alone nine members of Our
team qualified for the Easterns,
and it's only the first meet Of the
