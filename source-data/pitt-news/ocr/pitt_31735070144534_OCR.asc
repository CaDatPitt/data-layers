Pa. among nation's worst carbon emitters

by Anthony Brino
For T /?e Pitt New

A speaker from one of Penn-
sylvania’s largest environmental
advocacy groups said that Pitts-
burgh’s and Western Pennsylva-
nia’s climate could climb to match
Kentucky’s climate in the next 60
years, even in the best-case sce-
nario. '

“We’re screwed even if we
lower emissions,” said group coor-
dinator Sharon Pillar, of PennFu—
ture, an environmental advocacy
group. K

Pillar discussed Pennsylvania’s
impact on global warming with
members of “the student group
Free the Planet yesterday at one of
13 events for Focus the Nation, a
nationwide campaign with 1,000
participating campuses, including

Pitt and Carnegie Mellon. Free the -

Planet hosted presentations in the
Cathedral of Learning with free
admission.

The worst—case scenario, which

assumes that emissions levels stay
the same, would mean that West-
ern Pennsylvania’s climate will be
as warm as Alabarna’s in 2070, said
Pillar in the Pennsylvania Climate
Action Plan ' presentation. The
Union of Concerned Scientists
conducted the study that provided
these statistics.

By 2070 Pittsburgh will see at
least 30 days a year with tempera-
tures more than 90 degrees, and if
state emissions remain the same,
the city will experience more than
60 90—degree days.

Pennsylvania is the third—largest
contributor to greenhouse gases in
the country —— California is the
first, Texas second —— and emits 1
percent of the world’s total emis-
sions -while accounting for a small
fraction of the global population.

“Pennsylvania’s $4 billion ag-

riculture industry will also.suffer_

and already has,” said Pillar.

In 2005, Pennsylvania dairy
farmers lost $44 “million when
extreme summer temperatures af-

fected cow milk production.

Pillar said that PennFiiture and
other environmental groups have
to act fast, given the environmental
nightmare of the last eight years.

“We don’t have time, because

- the Bush Administration dragged

their feet [on climate change] and

PennFuture is also calling for
a 25 and 80 percent emissions re-
duction by 2025 and 2050, respec-
tively, in the state. Students praised
these goals, but Pillar was reluctant

to express confidence.
She said the group has decided
to compromise with energy in-
dustries in an

she said. “But

in its infancy

but strongly supported by coal and

mining companies like Consol En-
ergy Inc. .

‘ An accomplishment Pillar not-

ed was the passage of the Pennsyl-

vania Climate Change Act in rnid—

2008. Though it does not call for
any speciﬁc targets for emissions
reductions, it will provide $650
million in much—needed funding
for research and development in
renewable energy, including $180
million for solar and $25 million
for geothermal and wind technol-
ogy, said Pillar. '

Pitt junior Weenta Girmay, a
member of Free the Planet and
head coordinator for Focus the
Nation, personally recommended
the presentation “The Story of
Stuf ” — a screening of a 20-min-
ute documentary that deals with
U.S. devotion to, and economic
dependence on, material con-
sumption — and a discussion with
environmental studies Professor
Ward Allebach.

Girmay said that students
should have had no qualms about
skipping class for Focus the Na-
tion, quoting Mark Twain: “I have
never let my schooling get in the
way of my education.”

Governor's proposal

forgets key schools

In response to the tough eco-
nomic times, Gov. Ed Rendell pro-

_ jected a new way of  that

incoming college students can still
afford higher education.

As part of the plan, which has
yet to be unveiled, the governor
proposed that incoming college stu-
dents whose families earn less than
$100,000 a year would be eligible for
up to $7,600 in ﬁnancial aid at state
system universities and community
colleges, according to the Pittsburgh
Post—Gazette.

Western Pennsylvania state
schools eligible for tuition relief in-
clude California, Clarion, Edinboro,
Indiana and Slippery Rock. Allegh-
eny, Beaver, Butler and Wesunore-
land community colleges would also
be included.

But there are some very impor-
tant schools missing from this list
of aid —— namely, Pitt, Penn State,
Temple and Lincoln universities.
Sure, the Governor’s plan aims to_
make college more accessible to
thousands, but it also unabashedly
disregards Pennsylvania’s big-name
state-related schools

Regarding the governor’s pro-
posed idea, Paul Supowitz, Pitt’s
vice chancellor of governmental
relations, made the following state-
ment “We’re still  to hear
all the following details, but if this
is a program that’s intended to help
make higher education afford-
able to Pennsylvania students and
their  then the state-related
schools absolutely should be in-
cludecl”

According to a _senior adrninis-
ttation ofﬁcial, state-related schools.
will not be  aid because the
state doesn’t have as much control

or inﬂuence over these schools’ tu-

wition increases.

» Despite the motive for Pitt’s os-
 the state continually low-
ersthe amount it contributes to the
University’s budget

To negotiate this financial strain,
Pitt is forced to raise tuition. This
response can only further deter po-
tential students from attending our
school Meanwhile, other schools
would become increasingly mon-
etarily attractive _ _

«The governor’s planned finan-
cial aid package also disservices the
especially strong academic ﬁelds

A notable to each state-related school.

Pitt, for example, _is noted for its
superior  and business
schools Most state schools offer
a range of academic pursuits, but
their resources might not be apt at
acomparable level.

- For the 2008-09 school year,
in-state tuition for undergraduate
Pennsylvania residents enrolled: in
the school of Arts and Sciences
stands at_$12,832. This  is
markedly higher than some state
schools and community colleges
Yet the governor’s proposal seeks
to help the schools that are already
among the more affordable in the
state.

Even with recognizable logos,

sports teams and alumni, schools»

like Pitt and Penn State can’t survive
on  and prestige alone. The
truthjs, runningauniversityis avery
competitive business, and Pitt can’t
constantly cut back and hike ‘tuition
rates if it hopes to stay competitive
Wflth a consistentlyidiminishing

‘state-granted budget, perhaps Pitt

will have no choice but to become/a
privatized institutionin the future.

Political problems like putting salt on snowy sidewalk

5

by  Diabes _

Columml/t

Politics has  had a knack for
sparking debate, _ but recent history
has spawned some of the tough-
est political deadlocks" known to
man. The issues at hand range from
whether or not gay people should be
permitted to tie the knot to whether
the Patriot Act should be a law or a

I constitutional amendment These’

concerns have been building in vol-
ume as they roll down a slippery
slope. Each new argument solves
nothing and only makes the prover-

bial snowball roll down even faster; ‘
Where is this snowball rolling? Why,-

to Pittsburgh, of course.
Look outside your window The

’ first argument has surely hit us, basi-
cally debilitating the city. I can only .

imagine what kinds of snowballs
have hit Washington. Surely its snow-
balls are worse than-our own. Can

_ you imagine what it must be like to

get around? And what are people
-supposed to do when the second
argument slides down the hill on a
collision course? The snowballed
arguments themselves will snowball
together. A

What I mean to say is that we’re
stuck square in a snowdtift of po-
litical slush. One political party pro
poses to put salt down and the other
political party proposes to apply ice
cubes. ‘Everyone will hear of this lat-
est argument bleating out of Wash-

ington, and surely enough people will ‘

examine their situations and respec-
tively choose a side. 1
Since the act of choosing is a
physical action, the laws of physics
must be engaged. “For each action
there is an equal opposite reaction,”
states Newton’s third law of motion.
Naturally, half the country will de-
mand salt so they can walk about the

streets  and by default, the other

half of the nation, enraged by such a

Remixing changing

progressive movement, will demand
ice to bring us back to the days when
winter really did stop all societal ﬂinc-
tioning

Now, I bring all this to mind so
that I can, on a basis of facts, critique
some of Obama’s rhetoric Accord-
ing to an article &om'All Headline
News, Obama said, “However we
got here, the problems we face to-

day are not Democratic problems -

«or Republican problems  These are
America’s problems, and we must
come together as Americans to meet
them with the urgency this moment
demands” .

Now, if we pick ‘through his
' wording, I believe we will come to
the same conclusion Somewhere in

there, I heard him say “work togeth- -

er.” Debating whether this is impos-
sible is useless since this debate would
bebetterhadwith the deceased, andI
stress deceased, ‘Isaac Newton. Since
a debate can’t be had with a dead
, man, his third law stands

Examined closely, this “working
together” directly refers to the oppo-
sition of two equal forces in Wash-
ington. Some will want to put salt
down, others will want to add more
snow. Botl1 sides will  it down
with earmarks, and thus nothing will
get done ,

Suddenly, my mind begot- a solu-
tion: What would happen if these
two opposite forces, instead of push-
ing against each other directly, pushed
only on different days of the week?

Icanseeitnow—amanis
freed from death row because he
was scheduled for Tuesday, and on
Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday and ev-
ery other Sunday execution is illegal.
Democrats will cheer. Republicans
will cheer. Of course, it’s tough luck
for the Wednesday man.

Then a whole world of problems
started  through my mind,
each one with a brand new solution
with this new light of compromise

Policies  are generally agreed

upon — for example, that murder
should be illegal —— can stay intact,
but issues that have deadlocked the
parties will surely resolve with this
new system i

Just think of all the wonderful
solutions Gay  can be illegal
for straight people and legal for gay
people Abortion can be legal for
people who want one and illegal for
those who do not want one People
who want free education from the
government can get it, and those
who don’t want it can pay for it. Peo-
ple who wish to continue the warin
Iraq can stay, others who decline may
come home

It would be a new wave of free-
dom  our nation. All could
decide which side of these issues they
want to spend their lives pushing

Let’s start right away with the ,

snow outside Let’s dump snow right
on the sidewalk and then salt it;

Movie full of 'Uninvited' pi

"The Uninvited"

Starring Elizabeth Banks,
Emily Browning
Directed by Charles and
Thomas Guard

Cold Spring Pictures

 

In many ways, “The Uninvited”
is just like a new step—parent —— ir-
ritating and awkward at ﬁrst, but
slowly gains acceptance through a
few moments of real quality.

'_ ‘The Uninvited,” a remake of

Korean horror film “Changhwai

Hongryon” by Kim jee-Woon,
fdllows the pixie-like Anna (Em-
ily Browning) as she returns home

_ after a signiﬁcant stay at a mental
V institution, catalyzed by a suicide

attempt following the accidental
fiery death of her mother. Anna

‘scheme. - '

Without revealing too ‘much,
“The Uninvited” contains a plot
twist of a-magnitude (and lack
of subtlety) that would make M.
Night Shyamalan proud.

While this twist is so signiﬁcant
that it more or less erases the rel-
evance of a good part of the ﬁlm’s
beginning, theﬁrst hour of “The
Uninvited” is so plagued by cliche
and bad dialogue that eradicating
it from the minds of viewers only
helps the film. However,ias with
most Shyamalan-style twists, it
also largely eradicates the agency’
of the characters in the film and,
along with liberal use of scary
“visions” rather than actual plot

“The Uninvited?’ does have a
few redeeming qualities. While the
dialogue written for Banks is be-
yond atrocious — among some of
the most hackneyed, bludgeoning

ten — she somehow delivers it so
that it’s not completely laughable.

This is no small feat, and a

allowed the ﬁlm to devolve into
ridiculousness. Additionally, while

“It’s important for anybody to stay
out of foul trouble,” said Dixon. “In
games we’ve won,  been in foul
trouble, the two games we’ve lost, he’s
been in foul trouble But we’ve had other
guys in foul trouble, and that’s probably

Pi-tt ﬁnished its 2008-09 out-
of-conference campaign ‘with a

perfect record in such games af-

ter dismantling Robert Morris on
Monday.

The No. 6 Panthers (20—2, 7-2
Big East) return to Big East action
against DePaul on Saturday after-
noon in Chicago at 4 p.m.

On paper, Saturday’s game
looks like one the Panthers should
have the advantage in, but teams
in the Big East are quickly learning
there is no such thing.

Huge upsets have shaken up
the conference scene recently, with
Syracuse losing to Providence, and
Georgetown and Notre Dame
coming up short against Cincin-
nati. *

The Blue Demons (8-15, 0-10
Big East) will be hungry for a vic-

 . tory, while the team is in the midst

of a season-long, 10-game losing
streak, all against Big East oppo-
nents.

No Confirmation on

Cavanaugh move

by Mike Gladysz
Sparta Editor

Neither Pitt nor the New York
jets could conﬁrm on Thursday
that Pitt offensive coordinator
Matt Cavanaugh is on his way to
the NFL.

The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette
reported on Wednesday that Ca-
vanaugh, who has been at Pitt
since 2004, is expected to take a
job working on the Jets’ offensive
staff But on Wednesday after-
noon, Pitt coach Dave Warmst—
edt said he didn’t anticipate any

coaching changes.

Cavanaugh, who has _several
years of NFL coaching experi-
ence, fell under heavy scrutiny by
media and fans during this past
season — especially after Pitt’s
3-0 loss’ to Oregon State in the
Sun Bowl. But Wannstedt said at
the end of the season that he had
no plans of moving Cavanaugh
and didn’t expect any changes.

If he does leave, Cavanaugh
will likely work with the quarter-
backs.

guard Jermaine Dixon. “They just took Mar-
quette down to the wire. They’re going to
compete.” .

DePaul is led by sophomore swingman
Dar Tucker, who is_ currently averaging 18.5
points per contest. ’

In last year’s game at the Petersen Events

Center, Tucker paced the Blue Demons in
scoring, registering 23 points in the Panthers’

~ 98-79 victory. . ,
Tucker is questionable with an ankle in-

jury; but coach Jamie Dixon expects him to
Play- ~

“We’ve been practicing as if [Tucker] is
going to play,” said Dixon.

' In that game, the Panthers put up 98
points, their best scoring effort in last year’s
Big East schedule. This year, the Blue De-
mons will have to defend a much-irnproved
offensive team. ~

DePaul’s struggles have come mostly on
the offensive side of the ball, and that doesn’t
bode well against one of the better defensive
teams in the nation.

The Blue Demons are only averaging
66 points per contest, while shooting only
41 percent from the field. In contrast, Pitt
‘scores nearly 78 points per game on 47—per—
cent shooting. ‘

The lack of scoring may stem from DeP—
aul’s inability to disnibute or take care of the
ball. The Blue Demons currently average 11
assists per game, while yielding 12 turnovers.

The Panthers, on the other hand, have a
1.5 assist—to-turnover-ratio, which has vastly
improved the tearn’s offensive efficiency so

‘far this year. ’

One of the major factors in last year’s
game was Pitt’s ability to control to defensive
glass, outrebounding DePaul by 16. _

To little surprise, it was sophomore center
Dejuan Blair with the monster rebounding
effort, recording 14 and scoring 22 points.

If the Panthers want to see similar results-

this time around, they will need to contain
the only player on the Blue Demons that av-
erages a double-double. Sophomore center
Mac Koshwal averages 13.5 points and 10
rebounds per game. ' « 9
Despite the Blue Demons’ troubles, se-

i nior forward Sam Young knows that the
Panthers can’t look past,Saturc'lay’s contest to

'Monday’s primetime showdown with West
Virginia.‘ ' 1 i
I “To play against a team like us, I know

they’re going to get up for this game,” -said '
Young. “If we don’t come there prepared, we -

could be in for a long night.” V I
