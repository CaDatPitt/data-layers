Moorhead, McCarthy Launch Talks

    

 

by SUE HOENSTINE

“The present welfare system
denies the right to the pursuit of
happiness and it must go“ were
the words of Representative Wil-
liam S. Moorhead in his keynote
address to the delegates of the
National Welfare Rights organiza-
tion’s annual convention.

The first general session was
held Wednesday evening at Sol-
diers and Sailors Memorial.

Encouraging the members to,
lobby and knowthe details of wel-
fare legislation, Moorhead out-
lined “concentration and alli-
ance" as two techniques for im-
proving welfare programs. ,

He advised the audience to con-
centrate on spreading the notion
that welfare is a right and not a
privilege.

Priorities

With a declaration that the Unit-
ed States should consider a re-
ordering of national priorities,
the representative stated, ' “The

ship position in the alliance of i

‘only 790 students have signed up
so far as opposed to the .3600
who did so last fall, there are
about 2000 students who have not
yet registered. These include 1100
more freshmen and 300 transfers.
among others.

It would be reasonable to guess,
then, that at least 1200 students
will be taking basic courses next
term, making the one-third mark.

The language departments had
feared enrollment might be as low
, as 10 per cent of its previous size.

Long Enemy

NWRO Executive Director Dr.
George Wiley attacked Senator
Russell Long.. chairman of the
Senate Finance Committee. and
President Nixon as enemies one
and two. respectively. of the wel-
fare movement.

After stating that Long has
"taken every occasion to attack
WRO members as burns and peo-
ple who should clean his dirty
Wiley pointed out that
Russell Long is a son _of Hughie
Long. the biggest champion of the
poor since 1924. "We did not
choose Russell Long as our prime
enemy. he chose himself."

.Wiley accused Nixon of “trying
to make welfare recepients scape-
goats of the administraion as he
tries to form a fascist, dictatorial
regime in the United States."

KEYNOTE SPEAKERS at the Thursday address at the NWRO Convention,

“Inadequate Handling’   
-“Procedural Erosion’  .-

'Mayor Peter Flaherty and Minnesota Senatoi Eugene McCarthy.

by VIRGINIA JOYCE
Associate Editor

-Senator Eugene McCarthy told
a group of welfare mothers Thurs-
day night that the state does not
have the right to “decide how
much of a person each citizen is
in this country."

The sponsor of Bill 26380
which would provide extended
welfare reform if passed. warned
against the dangers of "the pro-
cess itself eroding the rights of
its citizens and the meaning of
persons lives." .

McCarthy, addressing the Na
tional Welfare Rights Organiza-
tion Convention (NWRO). here
-from Wednesday to Saturday of
last week, underlined the inade-
quacy of the Nixon administra-
tion’s~handling of the problems of"
the poor. P

According tovthe former Presi-
dential candidate. the President
attempts to solve problems "not
yet identified" through the ap-
pointment of "useless“ commis-
sions. V V

real issues.

He blames historical and religi-
ous beliefs for the "little that has
been done“ for the poor. “The an-
swer in America is that nature
would take care of us," he said.»

Police, University Talk, Recess .

Month-long negotiations between the University
and the University security force recessed last
week without reaching settlement. The major un-
resolved dispute was the wage rate for the campus

policemen.

He attempted. to answer the
question of majorityrule in this

pressed by this administration."

rule (by the government) must be

into a "protection of the rights o‘

guaranteed income was not "hi

strong support to the idea. ,

“The rights of -people on we‘

In Communicrttioits 9

by STEVE LUBETSKY

Several students interested in
communications are attempting
to implement courses in that area.
A much larger committee to in-
vestigate possibilities for a de-
partment of communications will
be formed in Sptember.

Organizing the effort is Devara
Berger. a junior majoring in Cre-
ative Writing. She claims that her
action results from an unaware-

ness that certain programs are ‘

currently offered. .

Recently. to her _"surprise."
she was admitted into a graduate
film course. “Such facilities exist
for graduate students. but not for
undergraduates." she asserted.

Miss Berger testified that be-
cause there is no department the
communications industries are

-reluctant to employ University

graduates. She included among
her objectives the development; of
an apprenticeship program in
which students would train as
broadcasters or journalists.
“This,” she stated, “would broad-
en their qualifications.” —

’ There have been similar mobil-
izations; noted the speaker. but
every time unsuccessful. "This is
due to student apathy." she rea-
soned.

Devara plans to compile a bro-

I

chure to provide information con-Aw

cerning faculty members to con-

tact and‘ courses and facilities '

available. .

Presently. students of commun-
ications resort to a self-designed
major consisting of courses taught

Freshman Class Gains

by SUE HOENSTINEI

Despite a tuition increase and
the recent financial‘ crisis. there
will be 110 more freshmen enter-
ing Pitt this fall than in 1969.
According to Dr. John G. Wilkins.
assistant director of admissions.
the fact that Pitt has not been
plagued with violence. Pitt's ur-

ban setting. and wide curriculum.

offerings have helped increase
Pitt's attractiveness to freshmen
and their parents.

Wilkins pointed out that the em-
phasis on a liberal arts education
that does not concentrate on busi-
ness, the engineering and nursing
programs, and the newly estab-
lished programs in the health—re-
lated‘ professions have also con-
tributed to the expanded enroll-
ment of the freshman class.

Pay Some To
Drive Through”

There is a fairly regular television commercial in which a well-
dressed young white man gets into a cab on a busy New York City street
‘corner. When the driver asks the proverbial, “Where to, buddy, the
,' passenger replies “125th Street and . " But before he can
complete his answer, the driver quickly says, "That district? Oh no.
not be buddy.” The announcers voice is then heard saying, "You can t
even pay somepeople to drive through the ghetto, how would you like
' T to live there?"

_ The situation between public transportation and the ghetto is no
 different in Pittsburgh than it is in New York City, but Pittsburgh‘s

. ghetto residents do have a solution to the problem of how to get -from
one place to another if you don’t have an automobile. How they have
i solved the dilemma can be answered in one word : jitneys.

JITNEYS—-PRIVATE autos illegally operating as taxi cabs and
one of Pittsburgh‘s black community’s main sources of transportation
—have been one of the main issues in political races and the cause of
probes into the city’s transportation system, numerous arrests and
prosecutions, general public unrest and endless debate. for more than
30 years. .

That television commercial clearly depicts why such a thing as a
jitney exists. The city's methods of transporting its citizens is obvious-
ly not designed for black people. These residents of poverty, have found

. the bus which they knew “ just had to be coming in a few minutes."

JITNEYS ARE in existence because they are needed. They pro-

vide a welcome service to their black customers. Of course, the city's

. transportation system doesn't think so as evidenced by the thirty-year
war that it has been waging on that "thief," the jitney driver.

On the other side of the controversy has been the Public Utility
Commission (PUC), Port Authority‘ (PAT). and Yellow and Peoples
Cab companies. Of course. standing directly in back of these groups
_ was City Government. The issue became one of major controversy in
. the city in 1951 with attacks by the PUC on the illegal autos. Fresh

‘attacks were picked up in 1954 by City Council, during which time a,.city
ordinance banning jitney drivers was effected. You see PAT an_d=7the

 ’ Ghetto property is incredibly cheap. Cheaper

Editor. The Pitt News: A

I read with interest the column
in your issue of 16 July by Staff
Writer Michael Simon which set
down in 500 words a comprehen-
sive and authoritative socio-eco-
nomic analysis of the Common-
wealth of Puerto Rico based on
Mr. Simon's recent experience of
camping out on the beach.

The column referred to the
Puerto Ricans' "imposed capital-
istic economic system". forced
upon them by "American-owned
factories" who degrade the islan-
ders by paying "poor wages" and
by introducing U.S.-made auto-

J Simon Blasted   

mobiles as status symbols. The
fact that Mr. Simon and his com-
panion were assaulted on the
beach was cited as clear evidence
of the smouldering Puerto Rican
hatred of "white. English-speak-
ing" people which h'as resulted
from this American exploitation
of “other countries“.

I would like to suggest an al-
ternative explanation of the at-
tack. Perhaps. in failing to ack-
nowledge that Puerto Rico is a
part of the United States. he or
his companion called a white.
English-speaking Puerto Rican
a native of "another country".

Or perhaps the assault followed
another of Mr. Simon's expert,
simplistic analyses of a complex
national problem.

I have just returned from a six-
month sabbatical leave at the
University of Puerto Rico, only
a small part of which was spent
on the beach. so I cannot pre-
tend Mr. Simon‘s astuteness in
pinpointing the source of all of
Puerto Ricos problems. But then
I didn‘t have all the answers in
mind before I went down there.

Dear Sir:

In your July 16 issue you re-

but there is something they are forgetting. Every
ghetto building that is torn down turns two or three , .
or more families out into the street with nowhere to
live. So the housing becomes even more scarce than .
it now is. And rents go up. Andnothing is built to re-
place the housing that is lost.

’ noble gesture. but somehow not enough of a price to
pay for the damage done. .

Although Steer's is the chief offender here. there
are others who own-ghetto property. yet do nothing
to help ghetto residents. Once such man is a Dem-

would be glad to use his property to benefit the

U.S. government and Commun-

be _ "voluntarily poor" (from
which premise they evidently
conclude that needy students
are "voluntarily needy':). and
they exclude students from day-
care as a matter of policy. Thus a
poor woman qualifies for feder-
al day-care money if she is in a
job training program, but not if
she attends the university. This
misguided government policy
has the effect of effectively ex-
cluding from university training
a portion of our population who
need it most: poor women with
small children who cannot af-
ford to stay home.

to get the University of Pitts-

society should take responsibi-
lity for the care of children and
that governments should shoulder
this burden. just as they maintain
public schools for all citizens.
However, because present poli-
cies systematically exclude chil-
dren of students from day-care,
we of the Day-Care Committee
feel that the university has a spe-

day-care facilities to women stu-
dents unable to afford adequate

Woman 60/Mat

by VIRGINIA JOYCE
Associate Editor

Womens‘ liberation has under-
gone radical changes in the past
year, switching orientation from
the defensive to the offensive.

If the University can be proven
to be legally discriminatory to
women, it may face a financial
crisis that would result in a loss
of honor along with funds.

The winning card in the wom-
en’s hands is the federal execu-
tive orders 11246 and 11375.
If its played right. the school is
in danger of losing thousands of
dollars in defense contract allo-
cations.

According to the regulations,
any agency or organization that
enjoys federal support must de-
velop a written plan of “affirma-
tive action to prevent discrimina-
tion based on race, creed. color,
sex or national origin."

HARVARD

The University Committee for
Women's Rights (UCWR). a fac-
ulty based protest group, is using
the precedent of Harvard Univer-
sity where $60 million has al-
ready been withheld under the
orders.

The big question now resides in
what constitutes "affirmative ac-
tion.” University Chancellor Wes-
ley Posvar and UCWR President
Ina Braden certainly don‘t see eye
to eye on it.

The Chancellor’s reaction to the
women's demands is reminiscent

Dr. Posvar, claiming that the
"University is opposed to all
forms of discrimination and fav-
ors equal opportunities for women
in respect both to education and
employment.” has proposed the
launching of a “study" and the es-
tablishment of a non-funded "Ad-

areas. will deal with educational
programs for women, career op-

tunities. to be set up with an eight
month tenure. will be composed
of four faculty (three women).
four students (all women). four
employees (three women) and

four administrators (true to the"

pattern. three women).

The women‘s resolutions are
along the same lines,_but with a
much stronger tone; they want
money and legitimacy.

Their counter proposal called
for a funded Office to Equalize
the Status of Women, with no limi-
tation date set.‘A second resolu-
tion treated the establishment of
a School for Interdisciplinary
Feminist Studies by September,
1970. Both measures, presented
at the University Senate meeting
of June 19, were greeted by laugh-

.ter in some cases and tabled with

dispatch.

The rejection prompted UCWR
member Nancy Van Vuuren, his-
tory instructor to react emotion-
ally. "Don't you realize that-Ithe
federal government could with-
hold money from the University
if nothing is done?" she pleaded.
“Now things won't be finalized un-
til a year after they started."

This kind of placating condes-
cension is a familiar phenomenon
to the women and was a major
reason f'or the shift in their o;iiien-
tation.

THE UCWR AND sympathetic women wait in the outer office of the Chancellor to confront him with their demands

for an end to sexist discrimination here.

“LATENESS”

By the time the Senate was
ready to give at least cursory ap-
proval to a resolution dealing with
day care centers, the body of the
legislature had left.

The reasoning was “the late-
ness of the hour," but Dr. Marcia
Landy. English. pointed out that
the women's proposals had been
lowest priority on the meetings
agenda.

Feminist bitterness has been
compounded by “slaps in the
face” of the genre dished out by
President Nixon earlier in the
month. More than a thousand
women attended a Conference of
the Women’s Bureau in the capi-
tol and they petitioned President
Nixon to speak before them.

His refusal. based on an earlier
committment to a Boy Scout meet-
ing. was "smoothened“ by the
substitition of a coffee hour to be
given by Mrs. Nixon.

Protesting the attitude that
"women should handle Women’s
business." the Pittsburgh con-
tingent. including Dr. Braden,
Elizabeth Scott, Joanne Gardner
and Miss Van Vuuren, boycotted
the coffee clatch.

In development. the Women's
Liberation movement has altered
its perspective. The concern no
longer involves the lack of wom-
en presidents. company heads and
diplomats. The context has grown
into a social-political one.

UP TO SOCIALISM
The Washington conference in-

cluded among its proposals a plea
to end the wars in Southeast Asia
“for the attainment of social jus-
tice at home."

On the campus, Women's Liber-
ation. personified by Assistant
Dean of the College of Arts and
Sciences Roberta Salper is mov-
ing towards a socialist ideology.

Abetted by other feminists, Dr.
Salper is looking at the evils of
the “capitalist system" as the
basis for discrimination. be it ra-
cial, ethnic or sexual.

The changing direction is re-
flected attitudinally by the wom-
en agitators. They are growing
less and less concerned with con-
vincing men and antagonistic
women that sexist discrimination
exists; they are beginning to re-
gard it as a truth.

You will get more welcome.
more advice, and more confu-
sion than anyone could happily
cope with during your orienta-
tion period and during your
first few weeks here. so I‘ll
try to be very brief.

College can be very differ-
ent from high school—but it is
largely up to you to make it
so. There are very few require-
ments in the College of Arts
and Sciences, and our new
grading policy—-about which I
hope you will inform your-

selves—-makes it possible for you
to minimize the extent to which
you work solely for grades.

We offer an enormous range
of courses. We have a very well-
equipped library. The city offers
music. theatre. films. and many
other ‘attractions. There are peo-
ple around who can give you
help in thinking about careers
and in deciding on courses of
study. But in the end. it all
rests on you.

Do you want to explore. to
investigate new possibilities. to
try out fields of study you never
heard of before. think through
the possibilities of careers you
have not previously contemplat-

An Invitation To The

University Community

by CARL VAN HORN

This year. "Freshman Orien-
tation" takeson a new name —
(New Student ‘l:Vorkshop‘70.)
Workshop activity includes pan-
el discussions, lectures. films,
and small dialogue sessions to
give new students an introduc-
tion to the academic, political
and social environment at the
University.

The central theme of the New
Student Workshop is (Alterna-

_tives and Commitment — Today
(ACT)! New students are being
encouraged to — find out what
alternatives are available to
them, while it is being stressed
that the commitment to seek out
opportunities must be theirs.
Since these new students will
ACT on their own discretion in
the next four years, the decision
to attend any or all of the
scheduled, programs is also
their decision. ~ V

I

:‘'‘J_‘. 

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

We hope that new students
and their upperclass hosts will
not don ACT buttons and delve
into issues concerning Univer-
sity life alone. We extend an
invitation to all members of the
University community to attend
the scheduled events of the
workshop. The participation of
students, faculty. and staff who
have cultivated a degree of ex-
pertise about the University will
insure that the Workshop is a
microcosm of the campus envir-
onment.

With the active involvement
of the University community, the
Workshop can best achieve its
prime goal: to provide entering
students with advance knowledge
of the diversity of alternatives
they will face at the University
of Pittsburgh in 1970.

Chancellor’s Message

On behalf of the entire uni-
versity community. .let me ex-
tend to you a warm welcome to
the University of Pittsburgh.

Your entry into the university
is. for most of you, the most
important undertaking so far in
life. This orientation program
is planned to help you become
acquainted with the University
of Pittsburgh and with many
aspects of university life.

In a university. each student
has an exciting variety of oppor-

tunities to discover more about‘

himself and his society. He comes
here not only to acquire skills
and knowledge. but also to de-
fine and pursue his interests. to
test his capacities. and to develop
his capabilities as fully as he
can.

The university is, therefore,

more than a training ground for

a career. It can assist the stu-
dent in under-standing contem-
porary society, its traditions as
well as its deficiencies. It thus

A Draft lieforms Could

Threaten Deferments

by STEVE LUBETSKY
Staff Writer

For millions of draft—e1igible
men, the university may not
provide a haven of refuge
much longer.

In a message April 23, Pres-
ident Richard M. Nixon called
for the gradual abolition of the
present draft system, while
stressing the need for remov-
ing existing inequities.

Nixon expressed confidence that
a volunteer army can become a
reality in the near future. The
President hopes to accomplish
this by virtue of salary hikes and
occupational incentives.

In the meantime, however, Nix-
on cautioned that an immediate
end to the draft is impractical be-
cause of “the necessity of main-
taining required military force
levels to meet our commitments
in Vietnam and elsewhere.”

To make the draft more equit-
able, the President ordered a halt
to paternal, occupational, and
agricultural deferments. and also
urged a stoppage of student defer-
ments. According to the Chief
Executive, these “are no longer
dictated by the national interest.“

Should the proposed legislation
be passed, all future requests for
deferments. whatever the reason,
will be denied. Students drafted
during the course of their studies
would be allowed to delay induc-
tion pending completion of that
semester. Exceptions will still be
made in extreme hardship cases,
as they are so today.

Students and employees pre-
sently holding deferments would
continue to do so until their classi-
fied status expires.

The President’s second propos-
al calls for the establishment of a
national lottery. “We need to en-
sure," Nixon declared, “that men
throughout the country with the
same lottery number have equal
liability, to induction." Under pre-
sent conditions, he pointed out,
some draft boards call only the
lower numbers (1-120), while
others call numbers as high as 300.

The Pitt News
407 Sehenley Hall

by LEE TERKEL

The University Committee
for Women's Rights (UCWR)
is actively engaged in fighting
for better opportunities for
women at the University.

Susan Kleinberg, a member of
Pittsburgh Women‘s Liberation
commented on the UCWR. "The
group was formed in response to
the general abuse of women on
this campus. The UCWR is work-
ing for reforms within the Uni-
versity structure as well as at-
tempting to make our colleagues
better aware of the nature of sex
discrimination at the University."

The UCWR staged a "teach-in"
at the office of Chancellor Wesley
Posvar on May 18. The Chancel-
lor met with the group to discuss
the list of demands it had formu-
lated.

The women’s group desired that I

(1) no recriminations be taken
against any members of their
group; (2) at least one-half of the
eight high administrative posi-
tions presently open be filled by
women; (3) an interdisciplinary
School for Women’s Studies be es-
tablished; and (4) a child day
care system be set up by the Uni-
versity to assist marriedifemale
students and faculty members.

After an hour and a half of de-
bate, the UCWR.secured from the
Chancellor a promise that he
would give "a high priority“ to
the study of its proposals.

According to Miss Kleinberg,

who attended the meeting, the

group left his office with a deep-
ened sense of frustration.

Before the meeting, the UCWR
submitted ,to the Chancellor a list
of four women to choose from to
fill two spots on the Provost
Search Committee. Dr. Posvar

appointed a woman not on the list,
judged by the UCWR to be unsym-
pathetic to the goals of their group.

Miss Kleinberg commented,
“This particular instance proved
the Chancellors lack. of respon-
siveness.“

Dr. Ina Braden. president of
UCWR. noted that the implemen-
tation of the groups plan would
cost the University from two to
four million dollars.

“It is obvious that the mainten-
ance of the status quo is the most
financially comfortable course
for Dr. Posvar to follow,” Miss
Kleinberg concluded.

Jack Freeman, secretary to the
Chancellor, countered with an ex-
planation. "It is true," he said,
"that the UCWR submitted to the
Chancellor the names of members
of the UCWR. Chancellor Posvar,
however, does not believe that the
UCWR is representative of wom-
en at the University. He there-
fore decided to appoint to the Pro-
vost Search Committee a woman
who represented not only the point
of view of UCWR members but
that of other women as well. J

Calling Dr. Posvar “one of the
most ardent champions of wom-

b l

en‘s rights at the University,“
Freeman denied that “the Chan-
cellor is seeking to maintain the
status quo." He did note, though,
that “while the Chancellor be-
lieves strongly in opening oppor-
tunities to women, he rejects a
quota system and considers it in-
sidious and illegal." Freeman
added that “it's very late to be
talking about special allocations"
and cited the financial crisis as a
factor prohibiting large new ex-
penditures.

.Pittsburgh Women’s‘ Liberation
is primarily concerned with mak-
ing women aware of their status
in our society. “Women are ex-
pected to occupy a narrow set of
positions—as housewife, nurse or
school teacher,” Miss Kleinberg
asserted. “Women’s Liberation is
attempting to liberate women
from feeling obliged to fill certain
stereotyped roles.

“We wish to destroy the myth
that there-is an inherent differ-
ence in the temperament or men-
tal and physical capacity of the
male and female, an argument‘
often used to justify the barring
of women from certain voca-
tions, “ she added.

"But What Might Be The
Alternative, Mr. Lee”

(Editor's note: Lee Gutkind is a freelance
writer, and an English lecturer at the University.
He will be the professor for the Pitt News Course
in September, giving tips on the paper, and offer-
ing criticisms. Highly respected in his field of
writing, he has been published in many scholas-
tic magazines.) /

by LEE ALAN GUTKIND

The lamentations of Lawrence Lee, Pitt Pro-
fessor of English, appear regularly in the Sunday

S - edition of the Pittsburgh Press.

During the past few months, Professor Lee has
labeled our schools armed fortresses and “intell-
ectual nurseries” and likened university leaders
to Neville Chamberlain.

This distinguished poet and academician has

compared American students to “Nazi Storm

Troopers, demoralizers, Indians, destructors,
traitors, dynamiters, bullies” and “invaders.”
And he has warned the people of Pittsburgh that
student involvement in our nation's political pro-
cess can lead only to the destruction of the Un-
iversities.

I am not yet an established member of the
academic community, I suppose, nor even of the

English Department.-

But I have yet to meet a Nazi Storm Trooper.
Not once have I been confronted by a demoraliz-
er, a destructor, an invader, a traitor, a dynamit-
er. The only bullies I have known at Pitt were
assistant administrators working for the Registrar
or behind the desk at Student Accounting.
...I went to the library to re-read Lawrence Lee’s
columns before facing the typewriter. I read them
once and then again and again. I went home
and had dinner and returned to read them some
more. Each time I stopped for a cigarette or a

‘ cup of coffee I promised myself that I would

keep cool, that I would be objective, that I would
maintain an acceptable distance as any journalist
must do.

And yet, all the while _I knew it was not
fury or anger I was feeling, but just disappoint-
ment, a kind of sadness.

“The young can accomplish nothing unless they
learn something (writes Lee ). Many know nothing
unless we the living have taught them something.
Many have experienced nothing but riot and our in-
dulgence. Still, they remain discontent.”

(Should students know only what we decide
they should know‘? Can one not learn from in-
dependent study? From personal experience?
Should riot and indulgence erase discontent?)

“Mr. Chancellor, Mr. President — of {what-
ever university — some of us remember Munich.
And we remember the chief lesson of Munich:

“Appeasement will not work.”

(Then ‘what .might be the alternative? Re-_
pression? Violence? Military control of the Uni-

- versities? Should Creighton Abrams and M-14

rifles replace Wesley Posvar and rational think-
ing?)
“Inour country, not swiftly enough, but at
-an increasing pace, the black man is being
brought into the advantages of our society. '

“Black men have for example, been made pro-

From alien talk about dates, sor-
orities, dormitories.
months, that room was represen-
tative ‘of my life — bleek, devoid
of illumination, characterized by
temporary, revolving groups.

I treked everywhere, armed
with a briefcase that personified
the compactness and tightness
of my existence. I was “out-of-
it” and I couldn’t “get in” with
friendliness — for I was “weird.“

And then by accident I found
a-__ friend. One with flesh and

  

fessors, administrators, students in important uni- ,

versities. Some of them have been distinguished
and brilliant. Some have, in my view, betrayed
their opportunities.” -

(“Being brought?— been made?” Haven’t
these men earned the advantages of society?
Haven’t black men earned the advantages of so-
ciety? Don’t they deserve their positions as
professors and administrators, their acceptance in

« important universities? Is it only the black man’

who has betrayed his opportunities?) ,

“This plan (to allow students at Pitt two days
off for electioneering) is but another episode in
the continuing destruction of the university."

(Are colleges only for academic study? Can‘

we learn nothing from direct participation?
How does student involvement in the American
political process lead to the destruction of the
universities?)

“And one of the most clamorous and disabling
fallacies is the nurtured prejudice of the young
that they have special insights and deserve, with-
out effort on their part, rewards for merely exist-
ing.”

(Did it not take the “special insights” of the
young to realize that brothers and friends were
not returning from Vietnam?
unjust? That Jim Crow still lives? How old are
those who fight the wars? How old are those
who make them?)

“When a black man wears a dashiki, whether

his costume is authentically African or some .

merely colorful approximation, the is ‘declaring
for apartheid.” '

(Do you judge people only by their clothes,
sir?)

When President Nixon calls students bums,
when Spiro Agnew says they are effete snobs, we
can shrug our shoulders, smile the knowing smile
and consider the source. We know that Nixon’s
link to the youth of American is through Julie,
David and Tricia, that the closest Agnew has
come to young people are ‘the Jaycees and- th
centerfold of Playboy magazine. . »

They-7 don’t know; we no longer expect them
to know.~jWe look ahead to 1972 and we pray.

But 3‘-Professor Lawrence Lee is an entirely
different source. He is a representative of the
University of Pittsburgh, of the academic com-
munity,:'. not the Republican or the Constitutional
Party. .His column is published‘ in the largest
newspaper in Western Pennsylvania, and there
are some half million people who probably read
it, who; could respect him, who might possibly
believe him.

I do not doubt the poet’s "sincerity. He is ob— _

viously concerned. But I question his tactics. _

If he continues to write in this way, if he
reaches just one reader each week, then he is
contributing to the polarization of this country.

And though he may be perpetuating his Am-
erica, he is helping to destroy this country for
future generations. '

For it is not Agnew, or Martha Mitchell, or

even Lawrence Lee, but those who trip on their
rhetoric that we must fe__ar. -

by DON MARBURY _
Editor

In September of 1967, 17-year-old Donald Marbury came
down from one of Pittsburgh‘s Black ghettos. the Hill District,
to ascend the steps of a building he had before only casually
glanced at occasionally from his bedroom window, called the
Cathedral of Learning. '

He was a freshman in the University of Pittsburgh and the
thought that a high paying job,'a home in suburbia, and ever
growing eliteness and status were only four years away, was
constantly in his mind.

Life was beautiful for Don. He was thinking about pledging
a fraternity like so many of the guys were doing. He was doing
a little poorly in his studies but he wasn’t worried because he
had always been on the honor roll in High School, with a mini-
mal effort, and he figured things would work out (grade-wise).
the same way.

Then one day Don started noticing that there weren't many
Black people on campus. In fact, he found that hejcould walk
around campus for hours, through the crowds of students and not
even see a person with a deep suntan. He alsofnoticed that the
Black people were practically all like himself. They were from
the ghetto, yes, but their parents were not on the welfare, and
they too had always been on the honor -roll‘ in high school. The
Black students were all either well off, above-average in intelli-
gence, or some type of athlete.

And he wondered just who college was supposed to be for.

And Don was confused. Life was not happy. He was in
R.O.R.C. and there was a war going on which he was beginning
to dislike. His people had being excluded and mistreated in Am-
erica for centuries. He hadn’t known it before, but now that :he
knew it, he began to realize that the dilemma of Black people
in America had not changed.

The white students did not really accept him.

Don began to wonder why he had to have his girl—friend
back in the dormitories by a certain time. He wanted to vote.
He didn’t "want anyone telling him what courses would be
beneficial for him to take. He didn’t even like the ones that he

had a choice, in deciding on. He saw that to be a commuter

was not to be a real student at the University.
He wondered what was the use of grades.

Things have changed, trying not to sound ancient, I can
truthfully say that you have things a lot better than when I was

You won’t have any language ‘requirement. You won’t have
to take your girls back to the dormitories at any prescribed
time. You won’t have the option of taking ROTC or gym. There
might even be a girl in the room next to yours in the Towers.

Black people are here in numbers enough to assure some

sort of strength. A Black studies program has been ‘initiated, one’

of the best in the nation. Black people have a sort of autonomy,
while still keeping open channels with the school. We now con-

Grade Revisions Increase

by BOB BONN

A greatly revised grad-
ing system will be in-effect
for the College of Arts and
Sciences (CAS) this fall. The
new plan, approved by the
Faculty of Arts and Sciences
(FAS) on April 9, features a
unique credit-no entry sys-
tem. ' '

Starting in September, CAS
Students will have the option of
taking as many courses as they
wish on the credit-no entry ba-
sis. Credit for a course will be
awarded if “at least satisfactory”
work is done; otherwise, no men-

.' tion of the course will be made

on the student’s transcript.

The A—F letter grade system
will be retained as the student’s
other option.

The purpose of the new sys-
tem is to encourage students to
take coursesin unfamiliar areas
without having to worry about
getting bad grades. Courses
taken under credit-no entry do
not count in the Quality Point-
Average (QPA).

Departments will have the
right to decide which or how
many of their required courses
for a major may be taken credit-
no entry. Also, departments can
choose to offer some of their
courses only on a credit-no en-
try basis.

Students must decide within
two weeks after the beginning
of a term which grading system
they wish to use for each course.

The following is the test of
the FAS decision:

Whereas

The methods of evaluation
used in undergraduate courses
are of central importance in in-
fluencing the nature and qual-
ity of the education acquired by
students. E

The results of evaluation,
when properly transmitted, serve
many vital purposes, such as in-
forming students of their ability
and their progress, helping facul-

, ty and others to judge the stu-
dent’s potential for further work
in specific areas, and certifying
to the university the student’s
progress toward a degree; and

A certain degree of uniformity
of practice in applying methods
of evaluation and in recording
the results is necessary both if
these’ purposes are to be served
and if equity in treatment of
students is to be protected;

Therefore be it enacted that

(1) Each student shall have
a transcript recording all grades
6 in which credit is awarded.

    

/

I z,-
. 3808-5th AVENUE

(2) There shall be. two op-
tions for evaluations that must
be entered on the transcript: (A)
The Letter Grade System, and
(B) The Credit-No Entry Sys-
tem.

(A) Letter Grades shall be as
follows:

: Superior attainment;
: Meritorious attainment;
: Satisfactory work;
2 Barely competent work;
: Failure to do work of even
minimal competence;
: Work incomplete, for rea-
sons beyond the student’s
control;
I: Work incomplete,
research in progress;
N : Non-credit, audit; and
W: Withdrawal from course
with no penalty and no
credit.

(B) The Credit-No Entry
Grade shall be as follows:

S: Credit awarded for at least
satisfactory work done in course.
No entry shall be made for less
than satisfactory work done ‘in
course. Courses for whish an S
is received are not counted in
QPA.

G: Work incomplete, for rea-
sons beyond the student’s con-
trol.

I: Work incomplete, further
research in progress.

(3) The Normal Progress. Re-
quirement passed by FS on Jan-
uary 31, shall remain in force, as
shall the traditional rules govern-
ing the calculation of quality
point averages and the minimum
allowable cumulative QPA.

(4) Subject to the restrictions
provided in paragraph eight‘,
there shall be no numerical limit
to the number of courses a stu-
dent may elect to take on a Cre-
dit-No Entry Basis.

(5) Students shall decide by
the end of the add period two
weeks after classes begin) which
grading system thev wish to use

further

in a given course. This decision
may not be changed, nor may a
grade of one kind awarded for a
course be replaced by a grade
of the other kind for that course.

(6) Eligibility for mention on
the Dean’s List shall be restrict-
ed to students who have earned
grades of A, B, C, D, or F in at
least 12 credits during the term
for which the List is published."
The criteria for actual inclusion
on the List shall be established
by the Dean of CAS.

(7) While no student- can be
refused the option of taking any
course ,on a Credit-No Entry
Basis, departments may feel that
some of their courses are of such
a nature that they should not be
graded on the letter-grade system.
In such cases, departments, may
with the agreement of the in-
structor teaching the course, re-
quest permission from CASC to
give the course solely on a ‘Cred-
it-No Entry Basis.

(8) Departments shall have the
option of deciding which cours-
es required for a major, if any,
may be taken on a Credit-No
Entry Basis. Since one major
purpose of the Credit-No Entry
System is to encourage students
to investigate disciplines with
which they are unfamiliar, CAS
Council strongly urges .depart-
ments to allow some freedom on
this point. Students who have
been led by courses taken on
the Credit-No Entry System to

‘Role Of The University Also Questioned

Pitfalls Of Political Activity Analyzed

by DIANNE ULYON

The realities of national and
state politics have recently chal-
lenged the University with prob-
lems peculiar to any institution
which is dependent upon public
support for its existence.

Since the Universitys finan-
cial crisis this winter, the nation-
wide reaction to the engagement
of troops in Cambodia. and the
tragedy at Kent State, members
of the University community
have become increasingly more
aware that the institution and
those who attend it cannot ig-
nore the political environment
surrounding them. Efforts by
students, faculty, and staff dem-
onstrate that this awareness is
being channeled into debates,
programs, and action supporting
individual or institutional in-
volvement in the external politi-
cal environment.

To what extent should the Uni-
versity encourage student poli-
tical activism?

Two attempts are currently be-
ing made to faciliate contact
between students and the politi-
cal system. The first allowing
compensations for study time
lost by students campaigning in
the November -elections, is a
recommendation of the Univer-
sity Senate: and the second. in-
creasing student contact with
state legislators in Harrisburg. is
sponsored by two students serv-
ing on the University Senate

Committee on Commonwealth
Relations.
On June 19 the University

Senate approved the following
proposals for November. 1970:

— all schools commonly operat-
ing on the trimester calendar
are to revise their calendars
to allow a recess on the day
before and the day of the No-
vember elections. This two
day recess and the preceding
week-end would give students
four full days for campaign
activities.

— all schools commonly operat-
ing on the trimester calendar-
are to revise their calendars
to allow a recess on the day
before and the day of the No-

‘ vember elections. This two
day recess and the preceding
week-end would give students
four full days for campaign
activities.

-— All students participating in
political campaigns during
the week preceding the elec-
tion should be permitted rea-
sonable ways to make up
classwork.

— A Citizenship Information Cen- -

ter should be established to

provide non-partisan factual

information relevant to the
election. This material would
include: voting requirements
and procedures. demographic

and survey information on
election districts. etc.

WALLY’Sg
; . has . .

  

While the University Senate
proposals indicate faculty sup-
port for student involvement in
election politics, Michael Edel-
stein, psychology graduate in the
class of 1970. and Carl Van Horn.
junior in political science, are
attempting to generate support
and finances from student. fac-
ulty, and staff agencies for aca-
demic—political program for stu-
dents.

This program is divided into
three parts: 1. a student liaison
to transmit information between
Harrisburg and the campus /to
communicate the actions and
attitudes of legislators and stu-
dents between these parties.

2. A student intern program
to juxtapose reading assignments
with work in the capital to give
students an academic and prac-
tical knowledge about state poli-
tics. With sufficient financing
and program control students
could- receive academic credit
and serve as aides to legislators
in Harrisburg for a term.

3. Lectures and teach-ins about
state politics would become reg-
ularly scheduled events through
Student Government and/or the
Student Union.

The Office of Commonwealth
Relations, the Political Science
Department. the Office for Stu-
dent Affairs and the few stu-
dents familiar with the com-
munication difficulties between
University students and Com-
monwealth legislators have ex-
pressed verbal support for the
idea. However, without adequate
funding and co-operation. be-
tween the above and other areas
of the University. students will
not see Harrisburg through this
program.

cipation in the political process-

dents, faculty and administrators

students are learning to cope
with cafeteria food, coin laun-
dries and idiosyncrasies of room-
mates, the majority of the Class
of ’74 will be confronted with
over-priced and scarce parking,
long waits in adverse weather
for buses seemingly guided only
by some mysticism of the stars,
inadequate lounge, snack, recre-
ation and rest facilities, expen-
sive meals and a multitude of
minor irritations on campus and
at home which prevent most
commuters from achieving total
integration with ‘the university

tions with a fervor that borders
on harassment. The Commuter
Associations is alleviating the
parking problem in two ways:
creating new parking areas and
better utilizing existing facili-
ties. The Commuter Association
is now providing parking for
Pitt students behind the Carne-
gie Museum at fifty cents per
day and twenty-five cents in the
evening. In the near future, the
CA will offer additional new
parking area in Forbes Field and
on the old practice fields across
from Pitt Stadium. The Commut-
er Association encourages better

use of existing facilities by per-

iodically conducting parking sur-

veys of Oakland and posting re-

sults on a map of Oakland pro-
Vided to all commuters.

The commuter who relies on
public transportation has as many

problems as the student who-

drives to Oakland. Bus fare is
expensive; schedules are often in-
convenient for commuting stu-
dents and there are presently
no shelter facilities near campus.
The Commuter Association is in
constant contact with the Port

have bus shelters erected on
Forbes and Fifth Avenues by the
Fall Trimester. The Commuter
Association hopes its car pool
project will further help to alle-
viate both parking and public
transportation problems in Oak-
land.

In order to provide commuters
with good meals at reasonable
prices. the Commuter Associa-
tion is presently negotiating with
SAGA Food Service for a com-
muters meal pass for the dorm
cafeteria.

Since the commuting student
spends many hours on campus be-
tween classes. the CA is work-
ing for improved lounge. snack.
recreation and rest facilities.
The Student Union sta—f has been
very receptive and helpful to the
CA by allowing the Commuter
Association input into present pro-
graming and plans for the new
union. The CA is also working
for extended snack facilities in
the Cathedral and shower and

locker facilities for the commut-

. commuting

Although these problems of
are serious, they
must be considered as just ele-
ments of a much larger set of
problems, irritations and frustra-
tions, both at home and on cam-
pus which prevent most commut-
ingstudents from achieving the
envolvement with the whole
university community needed to
obtain a complete education.

The problems are not insur-
mountable. In the past several
months, the Commuter Associa-
tion has shown that much can
be done to make the commut-
ing student part of the total uni-
versity community. But much re-
mains to be done. The Commut-
er Association can only accomp-

   

lish these goals withthe cooper-
ation and involvement of commut-
ing students.

Pagelllilé-THE PITT NEWS—Monday, July 27, 1970

  Fighting to Save Earth Fromlllan

April 22 marked a time of warning. We are fowling our
streams, lakes, marshes. The sea is next. We are burying our-
selves under seven million scrapped cars, 30 million tons of
waste paper, 48 billion discarded cans and 28 billion bottles
and jars a year. A million tons more of garbage pile up each day.
The air we breathe circles the earth 40 times a year, and
America contributes 140 million tons of pollutants: -90 million
from cars—we burn more gasoline than the rest of the world
combined—15 million from electric power generation, one-third
of the worlds total. Lead in San Diego’s air gets deposited in lay-
ers on the Pacific. LA smog may cause mass deaths by 1975.
Scientists say that if noise continues to rise at its current rate,
we will be stone death by the year 2000. We already consume and
waste more than any other people. By the year 2000 the popula-
tion of the U.S. will be double that of today——400,000,000. God
only knows how many people will be starving then and remember
it’s the children who usually die first. We flatten our hills, fill
our bays, blitz our wilderness. Lake Erie is dead; the Mononge-
hela, one of Pittsburgh’s great rivers, is nearly sterile; the gov-
ernment tells us we need the SST; the use of DDT is still permit-
ted in 49 out of 50 states; the jets are coming to the Everglades
and even our nearly 148 acre Duff Park is threatened with ex-
tinction thanks to the Pennsylvania Department of Highways;
and, of course, we must not forget the great environmentalist
Walter Hickel-—he’s okayed the trans-Alaska oil pipeline. Oh yes,
don’t forget to breathe Pittsburgh’s beautiful, clean air while at
._ your orientation—courtesy of our local industries including J. &
at L. and U. S. Steel and others. The quality dr-ains from our lives:
I am one-twenty-millionth of a swelling megalopolis. On Earth
Day, Americans, young and old, came together for a national
teach-in to talk about our wrecked ea_rth.. BUT, “pollution and
babies” did not end on April 22 . . . . . Environmental Action, a
group of fired-up college kids who coordinated the teach-in, has
not stopped. Earth Day is over, the talk and warning has ended,
because . . . . . . . . . . . .

Other changes~will include a revamping of

The fraternity division will be. divided into
three leagues instead of two. The leagues were
determined at random and will consist of one
six-team league and two five-team leagues.

The dorms will also change their present
structure. The independent leagues will be de-

Kuhn Likes NCAA’s New
Ruling, But Sees Problem 

Bob Kuhn. the Pitt wrestler
who finished fourth in the NCAA

championships last winter. thinks .
; that the new qualifying system
:3-for the national grap tournament

'might backfire on the NCAA.

The new plan requires district
qualifiers. with a limited numb-
er of "placing"' grapplers win-
ning berths to the national
meet. Pitt is in District 2.. one
of the nations largest. meaning
that the most alloted to a sec-

j 1 tion can go to the championship.
That maximum number is five ~
.1 , per-weight classification.

“I like it,” Kuhn says of the
new set-up. “The nationals will
be better. But they’ll have prob-

. lems in the qualifiers.

"Some small schools, who

Kuhn does mention that he is
happy about the five berths allot-
ed to District 2.

passes for 437 yards in 1969. Bill
Pilconis. and Doug Ginden are
expected to shore-up the pass-
catching duties.

The key to the caliber of the
offense, DePasqua explained, is
the offensive line’S blocking. If
the linemen can crash the op-
posing defensemen with the fer-
ocity that the name, Panther,
implies, then the burly backs
will be “real runners.”

John Simpson (230). tackles

Harkiewicz (227). and center
Bob Kuziel (222)
thers on the renovated offensive
line.

Simpson is the only experienc-
ed hand in the quintet. while
the coaches consider Lynn “a
good replacement" for graduat-
ing—guard Ed Sadowski. And.
Harkiewicz will be testing his
skills from the opposite side of
the scrimmage line for his first
time at Pitt. Previously. he man-
ned the tackle spot on‘ the de-
line. Webster. mean-
. is a strong. tough sopho-

The center position is, per-
DePasqua’s most worri-
some location on the line. Last
season’s All-East center Dave
Magyar convinced his ‘coaches
as well as ‘his opponents of his
superior blocking ability. Now,
Bob Kuziel has the unenviable
task of ‘living-up to Magyar’s

-. reputation.

"Kuziel hasthe size the abi-

: lity. He needs intensive effort
1: to develop his talent," DePasqua

said. "He'll get his confidence

" through exposure."

Many observers believe that if
the Panthers do have an Achilles

, heel, it could be the defensive

backfield. DePasqua admits that
replacing inside safetys. George
Pribish and Dave Dibbley, could
present a produgious problem.
Right now, Mike Bannan, Char-

lley Hall, Bryant Salter, J. D.
" Lewis. and Bill Ramos appearto

be /the most likely defensive
secondary candidates.

The Panther quarterbacking
chores could be .another source
of future headaches and night'-
mares for the coaching staff.
“Quarterback is still a question
mark,” -DePasqua commented.
“They’re (Dave Havern, John
Hogan, and Tom Hasbach) not
really tested.” . '

“Even though Havern has a

he's going into something alto-

ability. I expect to alternate Ho-

think that just one of them will

Freshman Football Coach Bill
Quinter, nevertheless, does not
face a depth problem similar to
the varsity's nor to the one that
he encountered this past fall.
He has 3-1 gridders on scholar-

ship in ‘addition to an expected '

number of walk—ons; last year he
drulled only 18 scholarship ath-

Therefore. while the varsity
tries to avoid the inj'ury- bug

Redesi

After about a two-month delay,
the Pitt Camaro became a reality
on the last week-end of June.

Driver Bob Fryer, a political
science major at the University,
and the rest of his “Pitt Crew”
began final preparations for the
Blue and Gold auto’s racing de-
but in early April, but the waiting
was caused by “several unex-
pected problems," according‘ to
Fryer.

t

'3.‘ “To be truthful, we had to re-

design the entire front suspension
system,” he said. “We discovered
the problem from photographs.”

Thanks to a photo buff’s lens,
then, the “Pitt Crew” was able to
prevent a bad start—and possibly
an end to a season before its start
—and the first auto on the Trans-
American series to represent a
University hit the track.

THE PITT CAMARO and its driver, Bob

Fryer took the Camaro, bear-
ing its new colors, to a track in
Warren, Ohio, where $10 gave the
crew use of the track facility for
a day.

Fryer and mo_st of the crew en-
tered the same auto (minus the
school's colors) in the Daytona
24-hour race last March—and
saw some success. The auto had
advanced to second place after
17 hours of the race before me-
chanical difficulties forced an
exit from the competition.

Shortly after the Daytona run-
ning, the group decided to" paint
the auto Pitt’s colors, and the idea
certainly showed promise for the
publicity-minded. Any e“first” is
a good publicity gimmick, but
Fryer realizes that above aver-
age driving, combined with a pol-
ished performance by the crew, is
necessary if the Camaro is to be
a success.

 

    

->0.

Fryer, at Daytona last March, be-

fore the car was painted blue and gold. The Camaro is the first Trans-Am
auto representing a university. There is no University money behind the

_ car, but Fryer is hoping for studentinterest in its running.

Pitt Camaro System
gned for Season

There is no University money
behind Fryer, but he is hoping
there will be an increased stu-
dent interest in the fall. One thing
he is planning is a movie on the
Camaro’s Trans—Am run, which
would be filmed by David Mizell,
an area photographer.

The Pitt Camaro hasn‘t been as
fortunate where money is con-
cerned as it has been with the
photographers, however. There
have been a few financial difficul-
ties in the Camaro’s short exis-
tence.

“We lost one mechanic primari-
ly because of that,” Fryer said.
“And we couldn’t buy several
pieces of equipment we wanted.
. . . We have had little financial
snags3’

The crew of the Camaro could
have more financial problems
when winter arrives. Fryer has
indicated that they plan to enter
the final half of the Trans-Amer-
ican series and also race in the
National Road Racing Circuit of
the Sports Car Club of Americ_a.
There is also a National “Run-
Off” in late November, which will
be held in either Daytona or River-
side, Calif.

“We’re shooting for the Nation-
al .‘Run-off,”’ Fryer said. “That’s
the big one. "

White Still Intact, Tries New Kick 

‘by BILL NAAB
Associate Sports Editor

John White is alive and kicking.

His forte is powerful legs, legs
that can sock a ball into the at-
mosphere so far that an observer
might inquire about the nature of
fuel stored within the 511",
175 lb. individual.

His goal is to capitalize on his
booting dexterity in order to shape
a career within sports.

The University athletic depart-
ment, however, is uncertain as to
which sport will be the beneficiary
of White’s ability. White blasted
rival soccer nets often enough last

, season to pace his squad in scor-
mg.

JOHN WHITE
Soccer or Football

Then. he tossed-on a football
uniform for the first time in his
19-year life last spring. "I could-
n't even put the stuff on." he quip-
ped.

His soccer-style place-kicking,
he hopes, can be impressive
enough to lift him into a future
professional football career.

“I love soccer—I’ve been play-
ing it since I've been two-years-
old—but there’s no big money in
it,” White remarked. “I would
like to make sports my life; that
has always been my dream.”

Even though he prefers to limit I

his athletic activity to place—kick-
ing. he could also wind-up per-
forming the duties of a soccer for-
ward and a football wingback.

Should Head Football Coach

Carl DePasqua utter glowing re- '

ports on White at the Meadville
summer camp, the booter from
Edison. N. J.. will receive one of
the 100 (over a four year per-
iod) alloted football scholarships.

At the other extreme, White
could be cut from the grid-iron
squad and thereby spend his time
exclusively on the soccer field.

The possibility which is sand-
wiched between the extremes
would dictate double-duty (foot-
ball and soccer) for White. This
would occur only if DePasqua did-
n‘t care to use-up a scholarship,
but also didn‘t want to wave good-
bye to his promising walk-on-.

Soccer Coach Leo Bemis, how-
ever, negated the middle-of-the-
road possibility, "He’s going to
have to make a decision." Bemis
said. "Nine of the 12 soccer
matches occur on weekends.
There's no way that he could par-
ticipate in more than five soccer
matches and also play football.

DePasqua, meanwhile has in-
dicated a respect for White’s po-
tential. After the spring game, he
stated, “IIe’s having trouble with
his timing, but heis only a fresh-
man and has a lot of potential. He

could develop into an excellent
kicker.

It has also been implied that
senior Joe Spicko. a two-year let-
terman. has the edge over White
in the kicking rivalry. Therefore,
it might be to White’s advantage
to additionally perform at wing-
back. In such tense competition,
versatility could be the determin-
ing factor in a final selection.

Yet. White hasn’t displayed
any fondness for his new-found
position. “I have played soccer
and baseball pretty well, and I

really don’t have the fundamen-

“They (the coaches) put me
second on the what-ever-you-calb

lot, but I wouldn’t mind just be-

would've probably said. “Get the

how I actually did; I’m surprised

Mike

by ED CONLEY
Sports Editor

When officials at Peabody High
School noticed that school spirit
was disintegrating in 1967
someone decided that male cheer-
leaders were needed. The recruits
came from the ranks of the ath-

. letes, and a blond swimmer was

at-.

among those convinced to give
their first cries of “Go-Team-Go."

Mike Hyde, now the only true
"letterman“ on the Pitt cheer-
leading crew (you can't call the
returning girls “letter—MEN),
was the swimmer who turned to
the sidelines. Today, he looks back
on the move with humor.

"It was almost like a joke," he
said. "In the beginning it was kind
of strange. . . . We took a lot of
kidding.”

The Pitt junior doesn’t receive
as much kidding as a cheerleader

Hyde is still handling the books,

Eventually he may enter re-

that he thinks there is a "psychol-

surrounded the recent SG elec-
tions, Hyde was a senator one
week and just an interested stu-
dent the next.

But Hyde thinks every student
should be an interested student.
And backing athletic teams is an
easy way to be interested.

“When people don’t want to
cheer they’re missing out,” he
said with rapidity and vigor that
would challenge his best “Go-Pitt-
Go.”

"We want students to travel to
places that are close like Penn
State—even if‘ it has to be in a
caravan.”

Cheerleading isn't a joke to
Mike Hyde, anymore.

Both Pittsburgh and Marshall will have the funny stuff on their I

With the tension surrounding
a big game, especially when
there could be upwards of 50.-

try tcggfigure ways to keep your

In Pitt’s case, it was the idea
of Keeping Kent’s squad on its
own campus instead of going
into Qlireign territory a day ear-
ly, which is SOP (Standard Op-
erating Procedure).

The Flashes coaching staff
saw no problem with taking the
two-hour ride to Pitt Stadium
the day of the game.

Theresa problem now, how-
ever.

ford the Flashes enough time to
get used to the turf.

Even if Kent could‘ find syn-

Associate Sports Editor

The University’s summer
sports diehards can be found at
the All-Purpose Fields or the ten-
nis courts in back of Trees Hall,
but the chunky, six foot, Black at-
tendant probably is the most die-
hard of the lot.

Larry Watkins is the man, who
for $1.60 an hour. regulates the
usage of the tennis courts and also
supervises the intramural soft-

- ball contests. Often. he can be

seen stroking a ball around the

. tennis courts or manning the right

field, third base. or first base
position for a random softball
team.

He has sort of performed in the
capacity of a Hessian soldier-
filling-in for any squad that is
short of players. Currently, his
name appears on the roster of a
group of undergrads, the Inde-
pendent Pansies.

However, few people realize
Watkins’ true athletic ability. In-
stead of “just messing around,”
he would prefer to display his
skill on the varsity football field.

In 1967. former grid coach Dave
Hart pulled Watkins out of Can-
ton. Ohio, as one of his prize re-
cruits. Once at Pitt. he didn‘t find
academics and football a com-
patible combo. Latin. Chem 11 and
Biology helped slap his QPA to a
1.33 level.

"I really wanted to start. and_

if I did bad in practice it worried
me all day, Watkins remarked.

His round, friendly face trans-
formed into one which implied
catastrophe or fatality when he
mentioned former assistant dean
of the school of liberal arts, Dean
Mulgrave.

"He told me that I wasn't suit-
ed for this school." Watkins mut-

tered as he inattentively shifted
his right fist and protruding in-
’dex finger back and forth. “He
told me to go to a littler smaller
school that protects its athletes
and doesn‘t let them flunk out."

Suddenly, Watkins‘ seriousness
converted into a burst of laughter.
He glanced in back of the batting
cage on the baseball field where a
little girl's sack-like purse had
been tossed. “That dog just
sprinkled on that bag," he chuck-
led.

A few moments later, after at-
tending to a couple of the grade
schoolers’iquestions, he spoke of
his misfortune. He mentioned that
he improved his grades in his sec-
oiid term. However, his English
instructor had left for Europe
without having turned-in his letter
grade. In fact, it was one and one-
half years until the University
finally tracked down the instruc-
tor. Watkins’ grades did not rise
appreciably in the absence of the
English mark, and he was asked
to leave the University.

Then. he realized that his world.
his football dreams, had been
crunched. Pitt was his Waterloo.
A sparkling collegiate career. a
possible chance in pro ball—ap-
parently idol thoughts never to
blossom.

He spent his next two years at
Republic Steel and Lorraine Coun-
ty Community College. Then. last
fall Dean Watson persuaded the
University to readmit Watkins.

“The only reason that I’m back
at Pitt is to prove that I’m not
too dumb to go here. "Dean Mul-
grave really made me feel bad,”
Watkins related.

Even though he admits that
realistically he shouldn’t try-out
for the football squad this fall.

Browns Andi Dogers X

Vie For Championshili.

Staff Sports Writer

Ellis Hatch. the captain of the American League champion Draft
Dodgers. likes the Charlie Browns. Hatch wanted to play the Browns
because twice before he has lost to them in champtionship action. Now,

Hatch will have to face the Browns a third time—again in a champion-

ship game.

The Charlie Browns defeated MBA (Masters of Business Admin— I

istration) last Wednesday and won (along with the game) the chance to

face the Dodgers in this year’s In-
tramural championship softball
game. today.

The Charlie Browns edged MBA
in a close game that wasn't deci-
ded until the last inning. MBA got
off to a good start by scoring four
runs in the first inning. but they
didn't do much after that. In fact.
they didn’t get another hit until
the seventh inning.

_ Meanwhile, the ‘”Browns were
busy catching MBA. In the Brown
second, Herb Dankmyer led off
with‘ a single which was followed

by a single by Mark Obenrader.
Jim Chamberlain followed the two
singles with a three run homer
which pulled the Browns within a‘

The deciding runs came in the
Brown sixth inning. Dankmyer
and Obenrader again got back-to-
back singles. Obenrader's single
to’ right field skipped between the
rightfielders legs for a three-
base error, plating the tying and
winning runs.

In MBA’s big inning, the first,

with singles which were followed
by RBI singles by Curt Grier and
Casser. Shafer followed with a
triple and two more RBI’s and a
four-run cushion for MBA.

The Browns respected MBA‘s
team effort but also accused MBA
of having a few "ringers" in the

common in the IM softball league.

A “ringer” is a player who
played in a game but had not been
on the teams roster.

MBA was a good defensive
team. but they had two or three
bad plays. The Browns. on the
other hand. had some clutch hit-
ting.

Consistent hitting or the lack of

lack of success against the
Browns to. The Browns shut out
