  New Ticket Formula

 Basketball Home Games  

P

  \ BY ‘HARRIS LEVY
tickets will be required for ad-
mission to Pitt basketball home
games this season. Free tickets for
~ ‘ lull time students will. be available
. at a sepcrate window in the Student
Union‘ '1 icket Office under new
procedures designed to eliminate
\ the problems with ticket distribu-
P tion for last year's games and the
5‘ l_’itt-P,enn State football game.
 .5 Starting two days before a home
A game and up until game time,
students will be able to get tickets,
upon presentation of their .1D and
 validation. The supply of student

_“ tickets has been increased from .

,‘ pproximately 1500 to 2400.’

llie new_ system was formulated

.'t a 1)eceinber meeting attended by
' lcprcsentatives from the Black
Action Society, General Studies
Student Cabinet, the '1nterfrater_-
inty Council‘, Panhellenic Council,
Student Ui1ion_ Board, Student Go-
veriiinent Board, Legal Awareness
Committee and Graduate and Pro-
lcssioiial Student Association. 1
the‘ establishment of a "consis-
tent" policy was the main objective
ol the meeting, according to Stu-
dent Activities Director Dan 'Me-
loro who organizedit.

The ticket window will be open
from 5 pm to 8 pm on the first day
of ticket distribution. “Up to half
of the tickets available will be‘ given
out on the first day,” Meloro said.

"lhe new first day hours will
accoinodate night students and

Iprolessional students who can’t get
to the ticket office during the

regular hours." The regular hours 4

are 10 anito b‘pm. ,
“1ickets will be available on
‘ Saturday at the main. Union desk
only if tliere‘s a game thatday.
Students can even call the desk to

Students can get one free ticket
with their iblandpvalidation. ‘?You

*  We. to come siIi_.—aP¢=’s9n meet your

ticket. No one else can get’ it for ‘

you,’.’ Meloro said. ‘There is no
reduced price for tickets for guests
as for football games. Students will
have to buygeneral admission or
reserve seat tickets for their
guests. ._

the new plan was chosen over
other ideas including lotteries,

charging for tickets, and a random ‘

drawing by a computer.

Pitt Labor Hearings Resume  

BX MA’1"1‘HEW KENNEDY

Laffor hearings involving Pitt and -

six unions competing to_ organize
University faculty resumed Mon-
day, with Dean of the School of
General Studies appearing’ for
cross-examination yesterday
moriiing. . *

Steele Gow ‘Jr. testified Monday
concerning the operations, budget-
ing and teaching" policies of the
night school, which draws on the
staff of other departments for it’s
instructors.

His examination was another link
in the administration’s “one uni-
versity-one union" argument a-
gainst fragmentation of the faculty
into several bargaining units.

Gow stated for the record he
believed more than one union at
Pitt would complicate organization

of the School of General Studies.

Pitt Professional Union \"(PPU)
counsel Louis B. Kushner led the
cross-examination, challenging
Gow’s experience with labor pro-
blems. ’ '

Gow said he had covered labor
negotiation on local railroads when
he worked for a newspaper be-
tween 1945 and 1955.

A series of questions followed,

1‘ aimed at outlining Gow’s authority

over the faculty of other depart-
ments to define the actual impact of
a split faculty union representation
on SGS.

lhe question of fragmentation has
arisen in the Pitt faculty union

' hearings because of the objections

of several schools to inclusion in a
single university-wide. union as
presently proposed by the admini-
stration.

The medical school, law ‘school
and Graduate ‘ School of H Public
Health faculties have intervened in
the labor hearings, which were
petitioned for by the PPU last
summer, in an effort to preserve
their independance from other
sections of the University.

Forbids US Intervention  

WASHINGTON AP--The United
States still holds North Vietnam
bound to the 1973 Paris peace
accords on Vietnam despite the
Communist capture of
Phuoc Long province and its capital
near the Cambodian border, State
Department spokesman Robert
Anderson said Tuesday.

Anderson described the fall of the
capital city of Phuoc Binh as a
“very serious matter” but em-
phasized to reporters: “We do not
consider this abrogates the Paris
agreement.”

“We would hope that the military
situation would wind down,” he
added.

Other US officials said the United
States would avoid tipping its hand
now on any plans it may have under
consideration to step up support for

- the hard-pressed Saigon govern-

ment forces.

At the same time the Defense
Department sharply denied reports
that a six-ship U.S. Navy task force
headed by the carrier Enterprise
had left Subic Bay in the
Philippines for Vietnam waters.

It was learned that the task force
actuallylis heading. for‘ the Indian
Ocean on what is described as a
routine mission of maneuvers and a
number of port calls.

Pentagon spokesman William
Beecher said ‘the task force had left
the Philippines on a mission “not
connected with anything going on
in South Vietnam.” He replied
with “‘no comment” when asked
about the Indian Ocean report.

Violation of the Paris accords was

"Our otlicer went into the rest

University crime on the whole
during the holiday period from,
December 20, 1974 to January 5,
1975 was down 90 ‘/2 from a normal
half-month period, according to
Graham. Thirty-five serious inci-
dents were reported, compared to
an average of 300 during an equal
period when school is in session.
"When you lose 31,000 people,
you lose a lot of problems,"

- explained Graham. “There were

three reported thefts in the dorm
areas, compared to a normal num-
ber of 25 or 30 or more."

,which journalism was responsible
' for revealing the extent of
corruption within the Nixon admin-
istration, it is quite evident that
7seére_,cy within institutions,
whether they be governmental or
’,‘non-‘governmental, is alien to the
ery processes democracy seeks to
remote in "a free society. '
“rid as a result the word secrecy,
which in some cases can better be
escribed as a meeting‘behind
losed doors not open “to public
crutiny; has taken on very serious
connotations. Its effect within
jgurnalistic circles has been to
reaffirm the responsibility of the
, press to get information whether it
 of a personal or public nature.
“The. journalistic profession .is
dedicated to the truth--all the
truth--gathered without barriers,
without restrictions and without
impediments. And it is for this
reason that it is so disillusioning
that an organization which in-
 promotes the high ideals of
the journalistic profession turns its
_,back on , the principle most
‘prized--the dedication to openness
and candor.

mt News: Party to

whenever they see ﬁt.

As of now there has been no
formal opposition on the part of the
Pitt News representatives to the

commission’s decision to hold such ,

non-public hearings.

Commissions by the very nature
of their charge have a right to hold
such executive sessions. But, not
often is a newspaper the subject of
a commission’-s study.

It can even be argued that the
commission is not a public body,
since the members were selected
and charged by Vice Chancellor
of Student Aﬁairs Alfred Moye.
The members, after all, were not
elected and thus are not responsi-
ble to any group _ labeled as
constituents. ’

On the other hand, the Pitt News
is a student organization which
provides a very signiﬁcant service
to, the Pitt community. The
commission’s work, which ,is
directly related to the paper’s
conflicts with Student Government,
is very much a public issue which
could have serious ramiﬁcations for
both groups in the future.

The question, then, is : does the
function of the commission out-
weigh its non-responsibility to be
completely open to the community?
And frm most indications the
commission, itself, has realized
this by agreeing to hold open
hearings in the first place. Yet, the
commission has decided to qualify
that concern.

And it is at this point that the
double standard of the Pitt News as
an organization becomes horribly
evident. We decry secrecy no
matter what form it takes. If it is
not conveyed publicly in editorials;

admirably

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY
‘Okay. It's out in the open, the
CIA is watching us. In fact, that
skinny guy in the back of the bus is
probably the local co-ordinator.
The question many people are
asking [and believe me, they can
hear you] is just what can I do to
throw a wrench in the proverbial
machinery, stick a wad of gum in
the legendary bung-hole, in other
words destabilize the CIA?
Here’s some down home advice
in the street.
Community security co-op’s:
everybody on your block can get
together, outline security proce-
dures, establish covert surveillance
groups for watching those sus-
picious characters on the next
block. Check out new neighbors.
Invite them over for dinner and
have your bowling part_ner ransackv
their apartment. Peep into win-
dows, ask nosey questions, stay on

your toes and keep them off

balance.

~ Religious paraphenaliar wolfbane

and silver crosses will deter most
CIA agents from nosing around
your home. Make sure your entire
family is outﬁtted with vials of holy
water, and knows how to use them.

The old switcheroo: trade wallets,
identiﬁcation, cars, houses and
children with neighbors _once or
twicea week. It will drive Them
crazy. The Russians have been
doing this for years, and you can .
see how well it worked for the
Reds.

Plastic surgery: for a mere
$10,000 down, you and your family
can have your entire collection of
noses, hands, cheeks and fore-
heads lifted, stretched, jobbed,

\ bobbed and nobbed, with a

co-workers.

The overriding reason for this
attitude is basically what any
journalist wouldlconsider the right
of the community to know all the
facts of/a given situation which can
be humanly conveyed. That is the
foundation of any attempt‘ at

journalism, whether it be a major
daily or a college newspaper.

And although the Pitt News
professes this as its ideal, it does
not hold when the Pitt News, itself,
becomes apart of a bureaucratic
structure, such as a study
commission. Certainly, if the

commission were charged to study‘

some other aspect of the Pitt
community, the Pitt News would be
seriously concerned that some
meetings might be labeled as
executive sessions--a euphemism
for secrecy.

In this case, however, the. Pitt
News is sanctioning secrecy, to
some degree. By not objecting
strenuously to the commission’s
policy Pitt News representatives
have seriously compromised and
jeopardized the integrity of a
newspaper.

It is hypocritical and deplorable.
How long can an organization
continue to function responsibly
when it is unwilling to adhere to the
philosophy it preaches not only to
its own members but to a world
unfamiliar with journalistic ethics
and sensitivities? More than likely,
not. _.v.¢r_y. .19ng.»... - -.  V

The silent treatment: don’t talk on

confessionals, toilet stalls, misile
silos, sewers, elevators, mountain
tops, windy plains, bedrooms, kit-
chens, sidewalks, gymnasiums,
operating rooms, open graves,
doorways and open windows. Also C
oak trees and playgrounds.

Can you trust you?: the answer is
no. Keep an eye on yourself, make
a note of your movements
everyday, who you talk to, where
you go. Never let yourself out of
your sight, one slip-up is one too
many. Chain yourself to your bed at
night. Lock your drawers, hide the ,
keys, and try to forget where you
hid them. If in doubt, shoot
yourself. The price of freedom is

eternal vigilance.

A the CIA. Their ranks are open to

anyone who can wield a pair of
binoculars. Once comfortably in-
side their organization, the only
thing you have to worry about is the
State Department, the FBI, the

Letter to The Editor ,

ii To quote John R. O’Brian (Pitt, As for Mr. O’Brien’s final point C

News, 11/20/74, “What is going

- on???” After labelling the previous

articles on ROTC credit a “propa-
ganda effort,” Mr. 0’Brian pro-
ceeds to engage in a mud-slinging»
campaign full of name-calling,
half-truths, and down-right lies.
First of all, Mr. O’Brieh’s
experience at [UP is, of course,
totally irrelevant to the situation
here at Pitt. The important point is
still .the original statement that no
one at Pitt is forced-to take ROTC
courses. ._
Secondly, not all ROTC cadets are
paid - only a small percentage of
freshmen and sophomores are on
scholarship. The rest of the
underclassmen receive. absolutely

I NOTHING. Juniors and seniors not

on scholarship do receive money -
$100 a month - period. Those on
scholarship do receive tuition,
books, and $100 (not “over $100”
as Mr. O’Brien stated), although I
fail ‘to perceive the relevancy of this
point. These students are not being
paid to attend college classes --
rather, they are receiving’ money'
while in classes in return for future
considerations, in this case a
number of years in the military
service. The only major differences
between this and an athlete’s'
acceptance of a scholarship are : (1)
the athlete puts in his four years of
service while still in school while
the cadet waits until after gradua-
tion,, (2) the cadet is involved .in
something which quite probably
will be very useful in the rest of his
life, and (3) the ROTC cadet is not
being paid with my (or your) tuition
and/ or activities fee. By the. way, I
suggest Mr. O’Brien study his time
schedule and Bulletin, speciﬁcally
Phys. Ed. 79 (Varsity Sports) and
Speech 166 (Technical Theatre
Practicum) -- football players and
members. of the Studio Theatre
already _can get credit for their
participation, as can many other
.“vo1i§‘1iteer'c* igienpe‘.  '"  I I ‘ ' 

.

.‘\r

(except for showing off his
extraordinary name-calling ability),
ROTC cadets are hardly bribed
with easy credits (assuming of
course that credit is eventually
given). Has Mr. O’Brien ever taken
an ROTC course at Pitt? I think not.
If he had, he might not make such
rash‘ statements. I have taken such
courses -'- until I decided that they

.were too much work for too little

reward -- has have many others at
Pitt. If a student is looking for an
easy course, there are many easier
than ROTC. /

I7 "

in I

I Fortunately, not all of the -" ‘V,’

anti-credit letters published were
as biased or as unreasonable as
Mr. O’Brien’s. However they do
raise some interesting points which -
deserve comment. Mr. Heckert for
example, seems to think that
merely because someone wishes to
be an Army officer he should forfeit n
his right to also study other areas.
Such actions could deﬁnitely result
in the creation of officers who know
only army skills such as killing. [If
that is what you. want Mr. Heckert,
you are, as Mr. O’Brien would
probably point out, .a fascist.]
Furthermore, all of the letters seem
to dwell on the fact that -the army
has too much control over ROTC.

.Isn’t it logical therefore to allow
' credi -- thus giving the University

some say in the matter?

“What is going on?” As Mr. '

Ingram and his associates stated so
well, “-A university is, or should

be, a place where freedom and I

humanitarianism are the para-
mount values..Within the universi- ‘
ty setting people should be
encouraged to range widely and
unfettered across the realm of
ideas.” Do they really mean this,
or do _ they consider only their
interests as being the entire
“realm of ideas?” ‘Yes, by all
means, WHAT IS some ON?

i No Good \Work A

From Politicians

Dear Editor,

To put it plainly, we are sick and
tired of novice politicians who
prefer to tear down and criticize
rather than offer their would-be
constituents genuine positive com-
mitments in their campaign
strategy. Agreed," criticism and
careful scrutinypare essential
ingredients of the democratic
process, but our current observa-
tions seemto indicate to us at least,
that politicians are fast talking
evaders of the truth, and have a
genuine lust for tearing down their
contemporary opponents.‘ A.

It would be truly refreshing to

hear good works of their colleagues ~

complimented by politicians, This
would be regardless of party
affiliation! If a particular policy
warrants change, then positive and
well developed roads should be
defined by the politician.
Politicians should not criticize and
pass the buck as a cheap and

unethical method to acquire pub- ‘

licity and notoriety. They likewise
should submit themselves and their

egos to serve the public’ and not‘

entertain the public...
Any Tom, Dick, or Harry, can find

fault and c_ritipize,_buttakes true

creative energy and genius to solve
or even try to solve problems!

Student interest in PIRG has
increased, according to Moon, with
a roster of eighty new members.

“Guided Selﬁ HeIp”New Course

BY REBECCA SCHORINV C
An entirely new type of course is

being offered this term at Pitt,"

directed toward intelligent stu-
dents who did well in high school

\

and on the college board exams,
but who are, unhappy with their
performance in college.

“A structured self-help pro-
gram,” is how Dr. Tom Schlesinger
of the University Counseling
Center describes it, but he
hesitates at labelling the students
“underachievers” because it
“connotes the traditional rat-race
interest.” I

The service-oriented pilot pro-

gram uses conversational methods
to arrive at the crux of the

‘ dissatisfaction and, hopefully, to

work toward constructive solutions.
However, Schlesinger stresses the
course will maintain a firm
structure and will not regress into a

"‘session of sitting around and

griping about the‘ University.”
Individual dissatisfaction‘ stems
from individual _ concerris,
Schlesinger believes and cites this
as the premise of the course.
The 11-week program makes‘ up
an intensive four hours each week.-
The whole group will undergo
counseling sessions and at other
times will be divided into smaller
sections for a program in skills
training and life planning. The
instruction in life planning involves
a structured set of exercises which
help students look at the future in
terms of values and accomplish-
ments. . 1
Working with Schlesinger and the
volunteers will be: Georgine

  5 Thoughts

‘BY JESS M. BRAEIIER
ARTS & ENTERTAINMENTEDITOR

- A VISUAL GUIDE TO SHAKESPEARE’S LIFE AND TIMES

edited by Louis B. Wright

Pocket Books, 279 pp., $1.65 (paperback)

Pocket Books has an interesting, although often amusing, habit of
mailing this’editor an amazing number of publications...perhaps 10
every two weeks. The quality of the majority is usually so-so, a‘ few
easily dismissed, a couple deserving a second look and then every so
often, a very pleasant surprise such as A Visual Guide to

;_:«.’i}'+'*Shakespeare’s Life and Times.

A Visual Guide grabs one’s attention with its attractive combination.
of the visual and the written. Quite simply, the book is a photograph
(or reproduction of a wood carving, engraving or drawing) opposite a
paragraph of description with a scattering of relevant quotes from

Shakespeare’s works throughout.

No big deal, it’s just a lot of

information and enioyment for $1.65. . .
With the limited amount of imaginative acceptance as is required by

theatre’s fourth wall, the reader can in a strange sort of manner,

recreate the day-by-day activities of Shakespeare’s life. From his birth

and baptism to his still powerful popularity, the re

ader experiences'and

relives a variety of impressions and pronounced forces.

In his preface, Wright explains his sources and other related
information: “The pictorial material reproduced here, was gathered in
the course of editing the Folger Library General R'eader’s Shakespeare,
published by Washington Square Press. Some of the illustrations also
appear in Shakespeare for Everyman by Louis B.‘ Wright and here and

1 ..-t-.”"“tl-zere in the Folger Library General Reader’s‘ Shakespeare.”

A Visual Guide is as much textbook as promotion. But the promotion
is a rare case for it’s limited to just a few ‘subtle pages so as not to
overpower the reader but instead, permits one 'to enjoy the living

experience of Shakespeare. ‘

‘ The book equally overcomes the limitations of its paperback formation
through its spacing and area given to the photographs. '

A Visual Guide to Shakespeare’s" Life and Times. was an unexpected
and enjoyable Christmas gift from Pocket Books (thanks)...the reliving
pp-,, experience was equally ﬁne. .

Dan Rather Crashes“Palace” Wall  

BY TOM WASELESKI
THE PALACE GUARD

' by Dan Rather and Gary Paul Gates

Ii‘ Harper and Row, 311 pp., $8.95

"i-<3 .

The 3book’s jacket calls it “a
fascinating behind-the-scenes ac-
count of the Nixon Administration
and the men who ran it and the
countrybefore Watergate brought
them, down.”

This is not another “Watergate
book.” The Palace Guard is a
unique analysis of the ﬁxations and
syndromes of one man’s political
psyche and the measures taken by
those around him to satisfy his
rampant cravings. '

Seasoned Nixon-haters will love
this report, if not for the

“"1nformation presented within, then

for the very fact that it is
co-authored by the former CBS
News White House correspondent
who bested Nixon in so many press
conferences with his relentless
questioning. Dan Rather can be
heard in every line of the book,
articulating each phrase and
hypothesizing amid swarms of
evidence.. .

With Gary Paul Gates, fellow-
staffer at CBS and free-lance
writer, Rather-traces Nixon’s

career of political stardom from its .

brash beginnings in the strident

“Q -communist days to the era of

wine-and-dine - detente. What e-
merges when one finally closes the
book is the strong impressionthat
Richard Nixon would have done
anything to further his political
rise_ , .. . ,

From better dead than Red
hell-raiser to diplomat vice-presi-
dent, from repudiated loser to
‘All-American comeback underdog;
from bring us together messiah to
iron-flsted dissent. crusher, from

peacemaker and world leader to

desperate fugitive and broken man,
from big loser to big winner to
ultimate loser we've seen the
moods and masks of Richard Nixon
go full circle several times.
Rather and Gates give incisive
portrayals of each facet of the
former President, including 'his
seldom-seen human side. In one
example they cite a group of blind
veterans visiting the President.
When Nixon informs them that
they are standing on a carpet
engraved with the Seal of the
President, the veterans crouch
along the floor’ trying to feel the
insignia with their hands. Nixon
immediately takes to his knees
also, hiseyes shut, groping with
his fingers, trying to “seef’ the
great seal. When White House
photographers clicked their cam-
eras to record the touching scene,
Bob Haldeman announced’ that
none of the photos would be made
public. Apparently Haldeman

V thought that Nixon clawing on the
_ carpet with the blind men didn’t
‘look “presidential.” it probably

never occurred to him, point out
Rather and Gates, that it did look
human. ‘ '
Haldeman was the man behind
the man. His adoration for Nixon
began in his college days at UCLA,
where he first met John Ehrlich-
man. Haldeman went on to become
a brilliant adman with the ‘J . Walter

-Thompson ﬁrm, inanaging. the .

“Bruce” in Review

. Another jump on

BY M.C. PILECKI

LENNY BRUCE: THE 'COMEDI-
 AS‘ SOCIAL. CRITIC AND
SECULAR MORALIST, Frank Kof-
sky, Pathfinder Press, $1.95.

Here we go again on a‘ “make
Lenny a hero ” trip.

Lenny Bruce must be damned
tired of that pedestal that all those
scholar types shoved him on
posthumously. It sure was a lot
easier to deal with p“Dirty‘ Lenny”
after he died than when he was still
alive and mouthing off to the world.

This latest literary rip-off is one of
the more recent to join the Lenny
Bruce bandwagon that has become
increasingly crowded with the
breastbeaters and ivory-tower

"dwellers who have seized upon

Bruce’s words [his life and cause of
his downfall] and twisted them for
their. own ends.

Sometimes, if the writer is good
enough at shoveling the bullshit,
it’s fairly interesting to read how a

\ guy canget somebody’s words to

say something that was «never
intended originally. Or sometimes,
if the writer' has really ' good
research, it’s even possible to learn
something new from a not-so-great
book._ ‘ A
Frank Kofsky loses on two counts.
Frist, his writing wouldn’t get him
past a ﬁfth grade grammar exam.
He has a choppy, overworked,

-O

agency’s Los Angeles office which

included the accounts of ~ Disney-

land, ,7-Up, Aerowax, ‘Saniﬂush,
Easy-Off, and‘ Black Flag, to
mention a few. Bob Haldeman
knew how to sell.

‘He showed Nixon how to
out-glamorize Hubert Humphrey in
the intense media campaign of
1968. And when the new admini-
stration took over, it was-Halde-
man’s idea for Cabinet members
and ranking officials to sport
American ﬂag lapel pins (so that by
the time '72 came around, most
Americans would be . subtly in-
fected with the idea that a vote
against Nixon was a vote against
America.) V .

The book deals at length with how
Haldeman and Ehrlichman in-
flicted such a stiff, authoritarian

" tone, on the Nixon Administration.

But the authors go far beyond the
mere influences of these two men.
We get a complete picture of the
administration through colorful
depictions of other’ prominent
members: the golden boy success
of Daniel Patrick Moynihan and his
ultimate ouster, the maverick
audacity of Interior Secretary
Walter Hickel, the wheeling-

dealing brand of politics practiced '

by John Mitchell.

The Palace Guard is just plain,
good reporting. The facts are
presented concisely, yet with timid
eloquence. The scope of the book is
limited, yet broad and matter-of-
factly enough to be interesting to-
even non-political readers. Anec-
dote: John Mitchell was John F.
Kennedy’s senior ofﬁcer when the
latter commanded PT-1409; the

‘ ,(Contin'ue(l'o'n I/’age‘10) ‘

confused style spiced with mala-
proped words and phrases and a
horrible sense of the English
language. it’s very disconcerting
to see such poorly executed work
being published. Such disregard
for the niceties‘ of the mother
tongue is becoming increasingly
tolerated among young writers,
and seems to be required for
so-called “radicals” as Kofsky.

Secondly, while Kofsky’s research
might pass muster for the typical
throwaway term paper, it’s sadly
inadequate for any definitive work
on Bruce. To begin with, of all the
stuff that has appeared in print
about Bruce, there is very little that
is worth a second scholarly glance.
Kofsky has ﬁlled his work with
footnotes and ibids, but has taken
no care in inspecting his sources.
Most are worthless or, at best, to
be taken' with several handfuls of
salt. ' 

Kofsky has taken his subject too
much on face value without really
going into him as a person, except

the Bandwagon

how he, the writer, would like to- 
see him. Oddly, he takes as a T 
primary source for Bruce-’s life his 1 L 
autobiography, How To Talk Dirty 
and Inﬂuence People, which has. "

been hailed as entertaining ﬁction,

but not as exceptionally factual. As ' '

a result, Kofsky ignores those‘

aspects of Bruce which Bruce chose ' . 5

to ignore publicly. So there’s only

a very superﬁcial picture of Bruce 5
of mythic » x .

here, and that is
proportions.

What makes this latest book on '

Bruce so disturbing is not its

sophomoric approach to writin or ‘

research, but the entire attitu e of

\ taking Bruceand using him for the

writer’s own cause. The book is
based on ' a paper delivered by
Kofsky [a ‘believe-it-or-not Ph. D.
and associate professor of history]

at the 1971 convention of the. V,
American Historical Association. 
[AHA]. Needlesstosay, the paper V 

was not well received. p ‘

works of these ﬁve playwrights into
one new entity. Peter Handke is an
Austrian playwright, poet and
novelist. Handke, has gone one step
beyond most other contemporary
playwrights. He does not preach
absurdity. His theatre abandons all
forms of illusion: all that remains is
the actor and audience.

Eugene Ionesco is a leader of
French drama and considered the
creator of the ‘theatre, of -the
absurd’. He believes that all life is

He is, “remarkably versatile with these instruments according to The

Livia Drapkin was trained in ballet and modern dance with Margaret
Craske, Viola Farber, Jeff Slayton, Meredith Monk and others. Phil
Arnoult, the director of ,Baltimore’s Theater Project wrote: “Drapkin
emerges as an unearthly and sensual sorceress...she uses a
magniﬁcent robe to create a' series of fantastic transformations from
one supernatural being to another...Her marvelous stage presence,
evident throughout the evening was ignited by the strength and ﬂuidity
of her body in motion.” . _ '

‘?Bill Vanaver and Livia Drapkin are two gifted and highly adept
performers who are constantly growing and exploring new techniques
as well as unearthing old and exotic modes and forms,” Arnoult wrote

Gymnasts Invade State

BY JIM SPANOS
Liyninastics coach lg Perez and his
team, which he has appropriately
labeled "The Miracle Workers,"
will be thrown into the arena

‘ tonight to face the Nittany Lions of

Penn State. Everybody knows
about Penn State, that haven in the
mountains of Central Pennsylvania
which grows outstanding athletic
teams on trees. Like most varsity
sports at State, their gymnastics
team is excellent.

A capacity crowd of 7,000 will jam

.Rec Hall to witness a new pheno-

menon in college gymnastics, one
which originated in international
gymnastic competition at PSU.
Men and women will compete at
the same time in what has been
named a “double-dual meet,” an
innovation of Penn State’s gym-
nastics coach Gene Wettstone.
Pitt’s men  Towson. College
women’s team will compete at the
same time as the Penn State men’s
and women’s teams. A woman will
perform her routine while the
previous man’s score is being
judged, and vice versa, and the
new setup should be good afor
college gymnastics.

()1 course, the only event of
importance to the Pittsburgh gym-
iiatics team will be how they fare
against PSU, who finished number
one in the Eastern Intercollegiate
byninastics League last year,“ and

number four in the nation.

" lhey have three of the best
all-around men in the eastern
United States," said Perez, an
energetic young coach who last
year saw his team increase their
point total 27 points from their first
meet to their last, without the
services of Don Stevenson, an
important man on the team.

"Uur men will be under a
tremendous amount of pressure,”
Perez said, “But there isn’t any
reason to get nervous about it,
because the potential of the Penn
State team to score points is much
greater than our team. »Our men
aren’t under as much "pressure to
beat the other team, as they are to
perform the way I expect them to.”

Perez’ team is unbelievably
young, with nojuniors and only one
senior in the starting lineup. Mark
Boyette is the senior on the squad,
a free exercise performer who is
recovering from the ﬂu, and Perez
expects Boyette to be the second
highest scorer on the free exercise
for the Panthers.

Pete Porzuchek, a freshman high
bar specialist, will be performing in
his first collegiate meet, and may
need some Maalox to settle his
stomach. Perez compares Porzu-

cliek's dilemma to that of asking '

someone who knows how to swim
to “dive off a 30 meter diving board
and do a double somersault with a

Pitt Skaters Complete
Successful Road Trip  

BY STEVE SYBERT
The Pitt Hockey Club upped its
record to 6-2-1 after two victories in
a three-game New York City
roadtrip last weekend.

The Panthers blasted Brooklyn
College, 9-4, on Friday and Nassau
Community College, 6-4, the
following day before dropping a 2-0
decision to Iona College Sunday.

Sophomore center Rick Vernon
led the attack, scoring seven goals
in the three games and raising his
season total to 12.

Against Brooklyn, the Panthers
powered in four second period

goals to break a 3-3 tie and added
two more in the ﬁnal stanza for a
9-4 margin. _

Denny Browne, Bill Gedeon, Jeff
Saunders, Paul Crisanti and Bob
Arturo each added a goal to
Vemon’s four to pace the Pitt
skaters.

Gedeon and Saunders scored
within an 18-second span in the
second frame with Saunder’s goal,
coming at the 6:41 mark, turning
out to be the game-winner.

day, Pitt needed third period goals

Rob Pasterick, a sophomore who
last year was the highest scorer in
ten years for a Pitt gymnastics
team, is an all-around man who the
team recently voted captain.
"He’s trying to break 50 points in

Pens Get Rookie Help   

BY CONNIE GIEL

One year does not a hockey player
make, and half a year does even
less. But General Manager Jack
Button thinks things are going
quite nicely with the Penguin’s
rookies-——all seven of them.

The Pens straddle the James
Norris division in third place,
comfortable but not complacent as
the pre-All Star period marks
mid-season. Noncommital, as per-
haps a GM should be, Button gives
neither blame nor credit to the
rookies who find themselves on the
ice regularly. No blame for the
Pens’ 14-16-8 record and no credit
for the hefty 152 goals for in 38
games (ﬁfth highest in the league
of 18 teams).

"I'm trying to establish a nucleus
of players‘like Dave Burrows, Syl
Apps, Lowell MacDonald, and Jean
Pronovost. I want to add a few
guys like Vic Hadfield for stablity.
But if you want to have a Stanley
Cup team you have to have young
players to work with,” Button
believes.

"I want to keep bringing in young
players like Pierre Larouche and
Wayne Bianchin. If we can bring in
one or two good rookies each year,

we will always have a solid tear'n."". ~

Button bridles at the suggestion

. that his philosophy for future team

Bennett in particular has roused
interest with Pitt fans. After a
good game against West Virginia,
Bennett stole the show at the 24th
Annual Steel Bowl and was named
the tournament’s outstanding
player despite the Cats’ last place
finish.

The Steel Bowl was particularly
tough for the Panthers. Not only
did they lose their hold on the City
title by falling before Duquesne
100-94, but they also faltered
against Penn State the next night
by an 88-79 score. The Panthers
did not play that badly. Bennett
controlled the boards in both
games pulling down a total of 34
rebounds while scoring 41 points.

The usually tight ameoba defense
had its moments in both games but
was unable to contain the hot-
shooting Dukes and Lions as the
teams managed to hit on 56% of

their shots while the Cats shot 42% ,

in both games.

Against St. Joe's the tight defense
returned, at least in the first half
when the Hawks managed _just
three points in the first 13 minutes
shooting 12% from the field and
committing numerous turnovers.
After jumping out to a 34-14
halftime lead, the Cats played just
well enough to win 72-60.

The Cats played even better
against Marquette grabbing a big
40-30 lead at the end of the first
half. Junior Keith Starr led the
way for the Panthers scoring ten of
his 13 points in the first half while
teaming with Bennett to control the
boards.

Then in the second half, after
Bennett and Marquette big-man Bo

Ellis fouled-out, Jim Bolla when to ,

the boards and stopped a second-
half surge by the Warriors which
had them in front mid-way through
the half.

Bolla finished the game with ten
rebounds after having just two in
the first frame and the Panthers
pulled away for a 65-58 win.

. St.‘ Francis wasn’t able to top the

surging Panthers either, as a new
star emerged in the guise of Kirk
Bruce. Bruce poured in 32 points

"'l'here are two types of rookies,”
Button says. “You see guys who

who know the NHL. And then
there are the rookies who come

BY ANDY BEHREND

If a Sunkist orange was able to
hoop, there’s no way he/she/it
could -be ‘playing any sweeter
‘ asketball than Kirk Bruce this
-éélason, especially of late.

The 6’4” senior guard from South
Hills leads Buzz Ridl’s inconsistent
Panthers in points per game with
15.7, and is shooting a gaudy 50%
from the floor. And anyone who
follows Pitt basketball knows that

. Bruce isn’t getting_ many inside
chances; his forte is the 20-footer.

Even more eye-popping are
Bruce’s stats from the last four
games. He's averaged 24.2 points,
including an unreal performance
against St. Francis when he poured
in a career high 32 points.

The lanky co-captain shrugs off

 any intimation that his game style
;/fkap-different now from earlier
‘ games. . '

“l was shooting about the same

earlier in the year,” - Bruce
' ' explained. “I’m just getting more
open shots now.”

Bruce really doesn’t talk much
about his personal doings on the
court. He is much more concerned
with the attitude of Pitt’s backers,
the ones who’ve been shaking their
pates sadly and mumbling ‘‘what’s

wrong?”

“Once we get a couple wins in,
we’ll be OK. Look at who we’ve
played, and where. Down in North
Carolina (where the Cats were
slayed twice, by
previously #1 N.C. State) you
couldn’t even hear yourself think.
We gota lot of bad calls down there

because the refs were intimidated-

by the fans.”

Expounding further on the team’s
road problems - Pitt is 0-4 on the
road, 0-2 at the Civic Arena and 4-0
at the Field House—Bruce pointed
out that the last loss, at Syracuse,

came at the foul line, where the . '

Orangemen took 27 foul shots to
Pitt’s 6. Pitt had made three more
ﬁeld goals, and you don’t need
Gadabout Gaddis to tell you
something is ﬁshy about that.

“We’re just comin’ up short,”
Bruce sighed. “We play in spurts
and then we die at the end.”*

These are facts, not alibis: unless
a team comes‘ up with a
superhuman effort in a “foreign”
place like North Carolina, they
won’t win. And you can put all the
visiting team’s wins at Syracuse in
a dwarf’s shoe; no one wins in
“The Zoo.”

acting now as a vocal leader instead
of having one main man. 1 And
everyone can "see the talent we
have on our. club.” With that
statement, he rattled down the list
of players Ridl has been using,
praising rookies Larry Harris and
Mel Bennett with gusto. ‘
“The new players this year
h_aven’t made more mistakes than
anyone else.- It just takes a little
time to learn to play together.”
But the time is ﬂeeting, and Ridl
and Company have to start clicking
on defense, where the vaunted
Amoeba is being dissected rather

 often inside.

After ten games this season, the
defense has been penetrated for
74.1 per game, as compared to last

 year’s 62.8 after ten contests.

Fortunately, Pitt plays but six.
more games on the road, while ten
are at home (with Notre Dame at
the Arena).

 _ ' Steelers will make their Super Bowl

 

BY YAIER LEHRER
_ ln just four days, the Pittsburgh

debut against the already twice

. defeated Minnesota Vikings, and

according to the oddsmakers, the

I ' Vikes will be three-time losers by

 (Chuck Foreman) on their team-

_the time Super Bowl l)( is over. But

with the NFC's leading scorer

combined with the arm and finesse
of Fran Tarkenton, the Northmen

_ 7 cannot be written off that quickly.
’ — \ Foreman, both the primary runner

 

 

V and receiver on the Viking team,

accounted for seventeen touch-

» downs over the regular season,
‘ nine of them on the ground and six

through the air, while his combined

  v V

yardage of rushing and receiving
totaled 1363 yards. Franco Harris,
Pittsburgh's number one threat,
had a combined yardage total of
1200 yards with but six touchdowns
to his credit. ‘

'l‘arkenton’s arm was 440 yards

T better than the combined total of

Steeler passing yardage, this while
sitting out the last two games of the
season. Not only that, but the
Viking passing attack connected on
59% of their attempts, far better
than the mediocre 43% posted by
Steeler passing. '

The Vikings not only have effec-
tive weapons on offense, but their
defense is probably the best the
Steelers have faced all year. Names

like Alan Page and Carl Eller have
inspired awe in opponents in the
past, and it is no different now.
Page was double—teamed all year,
but was still able to beat the double
coverage enough to be named
All-Pro, as was his teammate Eller,
and if the Steelers plan to take
advantage of their rushing attack,
the offensive line will literally have
to explode with the snap.

the Vikings in a disappointing-

showing against the Los Angeles
Rams. Even when the Vikings
fumbled the ball in the NFC
championship game, by the time
the ball was recovered, the Vikings
had gained twenty yards via the
bounce of the ball.

While the Vikings have looked
shoddy in the playoffs, the Steelers
have been nothing short of magni-

ficent. After handily crushing Buf-_

falo .32-14, the Pittsburgh offense
and defense combined for a inas-
terful 21-13 victory over arch-rival
Oakland. The offense got the points
when they needed them, while the
defense was solid, allowing the
Raiders to rush for only a humilia-
ting 29 yards.

The big story for the offense has
been the play of Terry Bradshaw,
who in the playoffs has exhibited

the talent, and maybe more impor-
tant, the confidence to live up to
the expectations that the Steeler
management had of him when they

drafted him number one in the 196?g:;;_ ’

draft.

Bradshaw has ably directed the
Steeler attack and dispelled the
idea held by many skeptics that he
is a “dumb" quarterback". His play
Calling has left the opposing defen-
ses cross-eyed at times, and unable
to predict where the ball was going
next.

Another Steeler who has per-
formed excellently in the playoffs is
Franco Harris, and a good showing
by Harris will just about guarantee
the Steeler victory. Franco has

two hundred yards.

‘While Franco and Bradshaw have
been playing so well, the defense
might well decide the game. With
the best front four in the NFL,
including two All-Pros,

t’wo All-Pro linebackers, and the
AFC defensive Rookie-of-the Year
the Steelers are capable of rising to

the occasion, and they probably .

will.

Kelly Pratt and Nelson Debenedet
in the first category. A hustling
right wing, Pratt played most of the
73-74 season for Winnipeg in the
WHA. Debenedet, a burly left
wing, spent some time with the
Detroit Red Wings of the NHL, but
remained under the 25 game limit
established for rookie eligibility.
Both men, versatile but little-used
remain in Pittsburgh, ready and
willing to shed the rookie tag.
Larouche belongs in the second
category, the exceptional player
who skated non-stop from the
junior ranks into the big time.
Button states unequivocally, “My

emphasis has always been on
defense." Two defensemen who
llll the bill are rookies Colin

(;ampbell and Dennis Owchar.

couver Blazersghas played in 20
games for the Pens. Owcharhas
skated in 32, after quickly estab-

A hshing himself as Button's type of

hockey player.

“Uwchar, Campbell, and Faubert
figure largely in the Penguins’
future.” Button said. “These
guys, and Larouche, are going to
be outstanding in the NHL.” A

licking off the essential qualities
that make a man NHL material,
Button waves his hand impatiently.

important. But the big thing is
competitiveness.

"We don't want guys that want to
win." A pause for effect, and
Button continues. "We want guys
that hate to lose. There's a big
difference, if you stop to-think
about it. Everybody wants to win,
but not many will make the
sacrifices that bring it about.

Button really believes that indivi-
dual effort is secondary to team
effort. He spurns ‘talk of superstars
and number ones. “Talent is the
key. lt’s not sometnmg you can
develop. The only thing you can
develop is to help someone blend
into the team unit, to help them

complement each other.”

That elusive something referred
to as hockey sense must be inborn,
according to’ Button.
there's no way a hockey player at
age 30 can play as well as someone
25 or 20 years old, a young player
has to have hockey intelligence in
order to make it.

“Experience is 75% and instruc-

: tion is 25%. Or maybe it's‘80-20, 1

don't really know. But experience
is the deciding factor.”

With 42 games to go, the Penguin

rookies can gather experience un-
der the watchful eye of Button, and
maybe even distinguish themselves
in the process.

Phil Gaston should supply some
spark for Youngstown. The 6-6,

Pitt last year and controlled much

Guard Terry Moore will also be a
big threat to the Panthers home

A bright spot to watch for in

Lew Hill who suddenly got his
