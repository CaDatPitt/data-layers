On Faculty, Med. Student Legislation

  Lawmakers Respond To Poll

by VIRGINIA COOK
Investigative Reporter

The "Pitt News recently polled
seven State senators and 20 State
representatives, the majority of
whom are from Allegheny County.
to learn their positions of two bills
—one concerning university fund-
ing and faculty, the other. medical
students. Both directly affect Pitt-.

Of the 27 legislators polled. six
replied. for a percentage response

of 22 per cent. The six replies»

came from representatives.

, A House Bill 2320 as amended on
‘third consideration in the Senate,
provided for a $47.million appro-
priation to Pitt. All six represen-
tatives who responded -— Rep.
Charles N. Caputo, Pittsburgh;
Rep. James B. Kelly, Ingomar;
Rep. James W. Knepper, Carne-
gie; Rep. Eugene F. Scanlon,
North Side; Rep. H. Sheldon Park-
er, Jr., Pittsburgh, and Rep. Jay
xR. Wells, III, Bethe] Park—said
they support the bill, and further,
each expressed strong financial
support for higher education in
the state.

Parker commented, _"I voted

 Activities Fee  

I)

To Face ‘Vote

‘ by JUDY DECKER

Pitt‘s student_ body will soon be
facing a most crucial issue. The
Student Activities Fee Referen-
dum will take place on Nov. 14 and
15. The referendum is occurring
so that students may determine
whether or not to retain the $12
activities fee.

A student is ‘not voting for or

against a $12 fee—their vote car- A

ries a deeper implication. A stu-
dent will be voting whether or not
the students will control their
activities.

If the referendum vote does not
pass, the administration will have
complete control over funding of
all activities. The administration
will decide what activities will be
funded, and the amount of alloca-
tion received. It is not probable
that all the’ activities that exist
now will survive next year if this
vote fails. ‘

Terri Weaver of SG Board ex-
plained that "though the activities
fee can be removed as a line item
 this vote. it still may be insert-
ed by the administration into tui-
tion as a hidden fee.” According
to Weaver. "There is a chance,
then, that tuition will be higher
next year. if the fee is abolished.

On Nov. 14 and 15, voting polls
will be established at key loca-
tions on ‘campus: the Towers Lob-
by the Cathedral. MCNR, and
Scaife and Bendum Halls. The
polls will be open from 9 a.m. to 9
p.m. Volunteers are needed to
help at the polls. Anyone interest-

4 ed should call 561-4688.

The ballot itself was worded by
the Student Judicial Board. They
phrased the ballot so as to allow

ty financially.” .

Wells. who is a graduate of both
the College of Arts and Sciences
and the School of Dental Medi-
cine, said, "I not only support
House Bill 2320, but believe that
the Commonwealth should fund
the University to a greater ex-
tent." ’ -

A previous amendment to this
same bill would have required fac-
ulty members to spend 12 hours a
week teaching in the classroom.

All the respresentatives who re-

sponded, with the exception of Ca-
puto and Knepper, said that the
questionwas one of University
administration and outside the
legislature’s realm.

Caputo reserved‘ his judgment
until he had more time to consider
the bill. but did sax he believes in
"equitable reimbursement” for
faculty Knepper saidhe did not
believe he was qualified to make
judgment at the present time, but

Seminars to

did say he felt this was an admin-
istrative rather than a legislative
matter.

Parker, who gave the most com-i

plete response to this question
stated, “I don’t believe that the
number of hours per week taught
by a professor should be the sole
criterion used to judge whether
the Commonwealth taxpaper is re-
ceiving value for his or education
dollar.” Parker went on to say,
“The amount of preparation re-
quired per hour of teaching,
whether the courses are basic.or
advanced, the professor’s re-
search capability and what he can
add to -the field of knowledge out-
side the classroom teaching are
just some of the other vital con-
siderations.”

Scanlon simply stated. “I con-
sider the amendment to require
12 teaching hours to be utterly ri-
diculous.” ‘

Begin for

Freshman Studies

. by LOIS ELDER

"Voices of Tradition and Revo-
lution in China," “Patterns of
African Thought," and "Nuclear
Technology—Its Basis, Its Bene-
fits, and Its Dangers” are among
the 30 to 40 seminar topics open
to freshmen next term under the
Freshman Studies Program.

/“The program was created this
August by Dr. Jerome Schnee-
wind, Dean of the College of Arts
and Sciences. It gives freshmen
the chance to enroll in courses
with exciting topics that they
would normally be closed out of
at registration. _

The courses fulfillthe Distribu-
tion of Studies requirement, and,
at the discretion of individual de-
partments, count toward a major.
Although most of these courses
are appropriate for Credit/No
Entry, the traditional grading op-
tions are used, depending on the
choice of the teachers.

Freshmen can sign up for one
Freshman Studies course during
the registration for each term of
their freshman year, but during

_the Add-Drop period they may
sign up for a second Freshman
Studies course that isn‘t filled.
This enables all freshmen to have
a chance to register for at least
one of these seminars. Each

’ course is limited to 20 students.

Descriptions of each course of-
fered next term under this pro-
gram are located at the Advising

Salinger Predicts Nixon

to Call Vietnam Truce 

by MIKE MILLER

"I will be Very surprised if the (Nixon) administration does not an-,

nounce a Vietnam cease fire in the next 48 to 72 hours,” Pierre Sal-

inger. co-chairman of the National Citizen’s Committee for McGover.n- .»  Hi

Shriver, predicfed.Monday

Salinger, also a former press secretary to President Kennedy, ’

said that the announcement of the truce would be a “two stage affair”

in which the administration would play up the cease fire beforethe 
election day and then reveal the terms after Nov. 7. These terms,_Sal-- « ’

inger feels, will include a coalition government in South Vietnam.

He does not see a Vietnam truce destroying McGovern’s main

campaign issue, however.

“The people’of this country are not as stupid as Nixon believes. They. 2/‘
won’t believe that a peace achieved in these last two weeks couIdn’t.f

have been achievedrfour years ago,” he said:

Salinger made his prediction during a telephone news conference}

with 11 college newspaper_editors fromacross the United States. _
He said that the reason McGovern is running so far behind in the

polls is because “being for McGovern is considered a subversive idea. ’

People are not telling the pollsters what they really think.”

As an example he cited the polling of McGovern campaign workers 
as to their presidential choice. Only 25 per cent admitted supporting’

McGovern. The rest said that they were undecided.

Concerning McGovern’s alleged vacillation on issues Salinger
said, "I have studied the record and he (McGovern) has not stepped

back on a single principle in this campaign.” ‘

He said that McGovern’s proposal to give every person in the U.'S.’/_ 

$1,000 per year was merely one suggestion as to what could be done to

solve the welfare problem and was never adopted as a hard and. fast"

policy. a

He contrasted McGovern with Richard Nixon who he claimed, ;
"Has never stood for a single principle in his entire life and hasnever 

kept a single promise.” _
Nixon is using the busing issue to divide the American people, Sal-

inger said. He accused the President of running a “campaign of inuen- "C71

do. He is intending to win the/election through fear.”

Salinger fielded questions from editors from our university,_ the”

University of Maryland, the University of Michigan, Rutgers Univer-

sity the University of Illinois, the University of California at Los An-_,y 
geles, the University of Texas. Marquette University, the University ‘

of Michigan, and Ohio State University

He described this type of conference as “unprecedented”‘and said _
that if elected, McGovern will hold at least two press conferences per_' 

year for college journalists. ~

  Committees Set to Review University Goals

Chancellor lnstitutes ‘Task Force

bx MIKE MILLER

An administrative task force is
forming under the direction of Ar-
lan Elser, Vice-Chancellor for
Planning and Budget. The task
force intends to undertake an in-
trospective analysis oftthe goals
and objectives of the University. ”

The idea was initiated by the

Chancellor and will involve three '

committees and a steering com-
mittee made up of representa-

ed by the Men's Dorm Council
and the Public Affairs Commit-
tee of the Student Union Board.

ed to the top, bringing to po-
litical humor the freshness and

The program will consist of two
phases, the first of which will ex-
amine and define the mission of

the University and decide wheth- right to this kind °f edu°aﬁ°“- I

er it should continue on its pre- ,

sent course or change its struc-
ture. 4

The second phase will attempt
to determine “parameters and as-
sumptions for what the future will
be,” according to Elser. During

this phase, the, task force will con- 

sider internal and external con-
straints upon the University.

Elser described these con-
straints as the amount of funds
available, the number of people
available, and the kind of student
body the University will be serv-
ing.

Most universities are pattern-
ed after Harvard and'Y.ale, ac-
cording to Elser. They are design-
ed to serve the sons and daughters
of members of the upper class.
Land grant universities, he said
were designed to give the children

V of people in the agricultural and

mechanical trades and opportun-
ity for secondary education. ‘

Elser feels that it is time to re-
structure universities so that

"they serve ‘the ‘whole spectrum -
. of society, that ‘has. here _to __fo_r_e_

  

The task force will study neans *

of cooperation with other sectors
of post secondary education, such
as community colleges, state col-

leges, private schools, and pro-j "_
prietary schools. “We don’t want .

duplication,” Elser said. ’

External degree ‘programs will
also be studied to determine Ways,
in which people can receive an ed-

ucation with little contact with '

the campus.

“We hope to define the mission
of the University and discover
methods to undertake to accom-
plish this mission,” Elser said.

The‘task force will be subdi-'

vided into three committees: a

graduate education and researchyi -

committee, chaired by Jerome
Rosenberg, Dean of the Faculty
of Arts and Sciences; an under-
graduate and continuing education
committee, under Don Hender-
son, Associate Provost, and an ad-
ministrative, budget, and govern-
mental relations committee,

  » Lawmakers Report

(Continued ‘from Page 1)
,'The Pitt News then asked the
legislatorséto comment on Senate

Bill 1210. This bill has been ap-
proved 45-0 by the Senate. It would

3‘ require “the repayments by grad-
’ uates of medical" or osteopathic.
’f schools of State subsidies paid to
I" the medical schools on their be-A
‘ half.”

For medical students entering

Pitt in 1973, this "would mean-
-ifoughly $4,700 a year.

 All the representatives, with the
exception of Caputo, opposed the
legislation. Knepper said, "We
need to increase capacity of our
medical schools and make more
efficient use of present overhead.”

Kelly supported Knepper’s pos-

ition by Saying “In view of the

fact that Pennsylvania is in com-
petition with other states, to at-
tract good‘ students and provide
top-notch medical training, I will
not ‘support proposals requiring
medical graduates to repay state
subsidies.”

- Scanlon stated quite clearly, ‘‘I
4am opposed to Senate Bill 1210, as
_I think it is the worst form of pro-
-vincialism. The state should in-
vest ‘more heavily in medical ed-
ucation.” '

Caputo said he was not familiar
enough_with the legislation to
make a firm commitment, but
from the Pitt News’ description of
the legislation, he would be in-
clined to favor the legislation.

Senators Donolow and Stapleton,
the sponsors of the bill, did not

reply.

Student Activity Program More Comprehensive

Fewer Programs-Better Quality-

by LINDA SAVAGE

The ‘philosophy of the student
activity programming at the Uni-
versity has changed, accdrding to
Jack Brown, assistant director of
Student Activities.

This year the programs are
more comprehensive, Brown ex-
plained. “Fewer programs with
more put into them.” ‘With fewer
programs, Brown said, more time
is available for planning, more
money is available for each pro-
ject, and greater opportunities to
do a “better job” exist.

Brown pointed out that this year

the Special Program office has
been combined with that of the

done was to prevent too many.ac-

There is a course offered from
almost every University depart-
ment. The Freshman Studies in-
structors are those involved with
undergraduate studies and most
are full faculty members.

Trudy Norman, an undergrad-
uate adviser and graduate stu-
dent working on her Ph.D. disser-
tation ln Art History, was appoint-
ed co-ordinator of the Freshman
Studies Program by Dean Schnee-
wind. “I’m interested in contact-
ing interesting and interested fac-
ulty members to propose and
teach these courses.

 Freshman Seminars Begin  

from large lecture courses. The
Freshman year is an important
time to get out of high school men-
tality and into a good kind of learn-
ing situation.

“We try to have the courses go
outside the traditional classroom
format with field trips, lab pro-
jects, films, and a lot of individual
research.

Norman feels Freshman Studies

is important in giving new stu-‘

dents an idea of the broad choice
of subjects they can study. "At
Pitt you can study just about any-
thing you want. Students seem in-
-terested and willing to work,”
Norman said.

Students with suggestions for

courses and teachers who would‘

be valuable for the Freshman
Studies Program are encouraged
to talk with Norman.

War in Culture Offered by History Dept.
New Course Scheclrulecl  Sill?-?::1.s:::t:;.::%1“Mm or

by ROB OBENREDER

War in Culture, a new course
dealing with war as an inherent
part of'society, is being offered

"by the History Department. Dr.

‘ " Michael Cherniavsky, an Andrew

Mellon Professor of History at
Pitt, will teach the new course.

The course deals entirely with
World War II, chiefly because of
the ‘proliferation ’.of material on.
the conflict, but Cherniavsky indi-
cated any war could be considered
in the same light. “War is an in-
tegral 'part of a culture,”»he stat-
ed, saying warfare consumes a
major portion of time, more than
any other activity.

Cherniavsky uses films and mu-

sic in his lectures to depict the
cultural influences prevalent in

warfare. “I use both documentary «
and ‘John Wayne type’-films, be-
cause both are part of the cul-
ture,” he said. ’

"We are concentrating on the
Italian theai/are because films are
available," Cherniavsky said.
Though he indicated a preference
for the Russian conflict, he ex-
plained that “the films are just
not available.”

The course is rather loosely
structured, there being no assign-
ed text or readings. “Any book on
World War II is valuable,” Cher-
niavsky stated.

Cherniavsky believed the course
to be a stimulating approach to a

«familar cultural institution: war.

He will be teaching it during the
Winter Term.

‘Her son, Ronald, had been stabbed in the back
fifteen minutes earlier by a group of community

Ronald was left lying on the bed. in the emer-

hour. Meanwhile, his mother frantically returned

  Nixon Health Strategy
Best There Is

by LYNN J. ALSTADT
College Young Republicans

Your good health is perhaps one of your most valuable posses-
sions. Therefore, most people normally take precautions to avoid ill-
ness and, should they become ill, seek the best treatment available
to speed recovery. The good health of the American people is
essential for a prosperous America. Thus, the leaders of the United
States ought to devote sufficient resources to protectand enhance
the good health of the American people.

As our President, Richard Nixon has outlined a National
Health Strategy which can be broken down into four categories:
increasing health resources, providing health and medical services,
preventing and controlling disease, and addressing special problems,
like cancer. Federal spending on health care amounts to $255 bil-

lion in 1972 (almost five times l965’s $5.2 billion) representing 10.3-

percent of the total budget. Almost $20 billion is devoted to financing
direct hospital care and medical services. Over95 percent of the na-
tion’s elderly are enrolled in Medicare this year. President Nixon has
proposed several bills to provide a basic health insurance coverage
for all Americans which are awaiting Congressional action. These
measures offer health care for everyone with government help—not
government takeover. Several programs to prevent and control can-
cer, heart disease, sickle cell anemia, venereal disease and nutritional
problems -have been initiated or expanded by President Nixon. The
"problems of alcoholism and drug addiction have received special em-
phasis. Funds for attacking the drug problem increased 600 percent
and money spent on alcoholism research and rehabilitation increas-
ed eight-fold during the three Nixon years.

While expanding the nation’s_health care capacities, President
Nixon has sought needed programs and vetoed unnecessary and un-
sound proposals. This year he vetoed a bill creating day care
centers because the bill had no provision about who’ was able to use
them. Because a wealthy mother had the same right to use the fa-
cilities as a -poor mother, this bill would have done little to directly
help the poor.

President Nixon has rejected service programs that are unre-
sponsive to the recipients’ needs and wasteful of the taxpayers’ money.
He has consolidated many programs .to eliminate Federal, red
tape-time, money and energy that could better be spent in meet-

ing people’s needs. His approach is built around people and not_

around programs. During his term of office, Richard Nixon has dem-
onstrated responsible management of our nation’s health care pro-
grams. To assure sound management during the next four years,
and to reject wide-eyed schemes Re-Elect the President ' '

One Way To Go

By GEORGE ZRUST

As most of you know by now.
City Council recently voted to re-
turn Forbes and Fifth Avenues to
two-way traffic once again. There
really isn’t much purpose in re-
hashing worn-out pro and con ar-
guments on the subject, but as one
who will be affected by the
change, I would like to‘ make a
few comments.

To this day, I cannot under-’

stand the people who say the one-
way plan produced a "freeway
effect”. Aside from the usual
percentage of idiots who insist
on racing through Oakland, most
drivers I’ve seen go at a normal
speed on the two streets. If the
“freeway” people oppose the one-
way plan because traffic now
moves along Forbes and Fifth, I
fail to see their point. I thought
that the purpose of the experi-
ment was to see if traffic would
move. I’ve been caught in the
Forbes Avenue traffic jam many
times "when the street was two-
way, and.I still don’t know why
anybody would want such a tie-
up.

Of course, some say that now,
because of the moving cars, it is
dangerous to walk across Forbes
and Fifth Avenues. Moving traf-
fic on any street is unhealthy for
pedestrians, but that is just life.
Granted,‘ crossing is even more
unhealthy when ‘a person tries it
where there is no traffic light,
or at a blind corner in the middle
of the block. This is nothing new,
and people are well aware of the
added risk involved at these plac-
es. Besides, I recall that crossing
Forbes or Fifth was more diffi-
cult when I had to watch for traf-
fic coming from both directions,
instead of just one. In any case,
I can't see where it is valid to

.imply that traffic should be tied

advantage of being able to. use
the two bus shelters at the Stud-

all the bus riders benefitted
from them, it was too cruel a fate
for the hard-fought-for shelters
to be rendered useless so soon.

Architectural Relics
Need a Chance

Just lately the forces of demolition appear to have taken a new

task, and I applaud it. Last‘ week, as the mad expansion of the_Uni-. -

versity continued, a recent structure fell victim to the wrecker’s ball.

It _was.a motel on Forbes Avenue, which once housed a coffee-
shop of varied reputation, and now it is gone forever. ‘

Personally, I thought well of the building, but its end is still '~

encouraging. It was not quite as ugly as its brethern of a few years
ago, true, it was made of concrete poured into forms, with rein-
forcing rods to make it all work, but it could have been uglier by a

neat margin — look at other architecture of the period for exam?"

ples. .

No matter, it is gone. I watched to make sure, and it is indeed
gone. _All the forces of technology conspired against it. A diesel en-_

gine swung a long arm; on a string at the end of the arm, an enor-

mous weight swung out, obeyed everlasting gravity and swung back.)
Nothing much could resist it. The reinforced walls yielded, some- ’

times reluctantly, and greatchunks fell to the ground.

The building had never been home to anyone, except in the“:

most transient sort of way. It was not full of historv' people may
have made love there, but hardly anyone was born in a motel. ‘ »

So the motel is gone, and it is a loss we can well afford. If noth-

ing else, this project kept the wreckers occupied for a couple of days, -

and some of the things we should keep have been spared for at least
a little while longer. ‘

I live in rented quarters in an aging house. For this reason, I

am sensitive to the attacks of the wrecking ball. We might be next. I
In fact, any old building sitting on land which has somehow ,be---

come valuable is in danger.

. So far this_sounds hasty and opposed to the god we all feel ob- '7
liged to worship — “progress”. ;It probably is. I suggest a short“ _
walk down Forbes Avenue, upstream, against the current pattern of A’

traffic."

but copies of them could be substituted for the defunct motel with-» 5

out breaking too many hearts. But further down the Avenue is a block

of former businesses and residences which are waiting their turn to _i_
fall under the ball of the Urban Developer. They might deserve your 
attention while they last. True, they are dirty. But look a little above ‘g

eye-level once, and see the work that went into these relics. ’

The whole subject is depressing, but I hope the new tendancy ’
continues. In fact, I hope it accelerates, and that every year even ‘C

newer architectural monsterpieces are torn down.

Then, a few of the worthwhile relics of the past might have any-

have combined to develop my role on Pitt's
campus. Some are more dominant than
others, yet all are influenced by my objectives
in nursing. I adapt my role to meet various
situations, but, University life is the major
contributor in learning to deal‘with people,
professionally and personallx.

Being a member of the academic commun-
ity of the large urban University of Pittsburgh '
has given me the opportunity to assume
the role not only of a student pursuing her
education in the College of Arts and Sciences,
but also that of a pro-professional working to-
ward a careergoal in physical therapy in the
School of Healthvkelated Professions. Sister-
hood in Kappa Kappa Gama, employment in
a business office in downtown Pittsburgh and
in the library, facilities on campus, and com-

» muting via PAT transit and private transpor- ‘
-tation,_.havo provided meswith experiences

and challenges that havevexpanded my role.

CAROLE GERMEK, No. 5 z

The University offers so many diverse activ-
ities for every interested student. Instead of
dispersing my energies on the many organ-
izations that couId,potentially interest me, I

have other chosen to concentrate my efforts-

on the organization of the new drill team, the
Pantherettes.

I am able to demonstrate my responsibility
to the community in my academic approach.
I am realizing now my goal as a future teach-
er of Spanish as a tutor at Forbes Elementary
School.

I am also an art gallery guard at the Frick
Fine Arts Building.

My role as a student and Pitt's unique in-

fluence have combined to offer me a series

of incomparable experiences.

. As a Pitt woman, I extend a person/al dig-
nity. I have my opinion, yet listen to the
truths of others. I am myself, not comparing
myself, for to do so would encourage vanity
anddismay. I try to exemplify what women
should be everywhere. I enjoy my achieve-
ments, but am cautious in my endeavor. My

by caring. I wish that through me, others

will feel a greater respect for each other.

It's wonderful to perceive the important
role that people play in our lives. I have been
aware of what meaningful and lasting rela-
tionships can evolve through interacting with
others. And during my past three years here
at Pitt I've experienced just that. By living
and working with others, here, I've found my-
self growing-—-becoming more interested,
‘more interested, more personal, more,con'-
cerned—a better me! I hope to continue this
throughout my life.

Being a woman in our modern world is a

challenging role for every female. Being a

woman at the University presents an even
bigger challenge. Times are changing;
women's roles are changing. College offers
women the opportunity to explore the many
roles open to her. ‘

Coming to the University has shown me-
that there are many avenues open to me. It’
has given me desire for more learning; op-
portunity to meet other people, the experi-.
ence of living with others; the opportunity to"
see .many different cultures,- and most of
all I have been giventhe chance “to be me.”

JANET LAMB, No. I5

Originally I didn't have a complete role as
a woman on Pitt's campus, because I was not
interested in the academic side of college life.
I have now established a well-balanced so-
cial and academic life and realized its impor-
tance. The academic side will provide a skill
for me that will enable me to have a place
in society, and the social aspect will assure
my familiarity with and ability to get along
with the outside world. Basically, my role as
a woman on Pitt's campus is to learn how to
live, at ease, an independent life.

CATHY LAPA, No. 16

I view my role as a _woman at the Universi-
ty as an apprenticeship preparing me for
the assumption of that same role in societyrl
feel the college experience provides a series
of stepping stones toward achieving the ulti-
mate goal of personal development; namely,
self-identification as a woman. Within the at-
mosphere of University life, I have seen,
heard, and felt deeply enough to have pro-
gressed from adolescence toward woman-

hood in a short period of time. Upon gradua-

tion, I will become an elementary school
teacher, a more-define role, but I will never
allow myself to lose that personal recognition
of my being a woman!

EVELYN ROSENWASER, No. 2l

 .I do not play one specific role in life and
thereforel would be hypocritical in attacking

this question from a woman's role only. My '

college life is more of a tapestry. I have met
many people from different backgrounds and
different walks of life, adding rich and royal
hues to my pattern. I have learned to listen,
to be tolerant, and more open to changing
views and attitudes. Thus broadening my
tapestry and allowing it to grow. Indepen-
dence and individuality are the backbones of
the design. Independence provides the de-
termination for me to go out and make
something of my life, my college years. In-
dividuality combines all the roles, to for\m
me.

My role as a woman at Pitt involves the

the new program, and also be given a tour of

 ‘Fritz’ Displays Animated l\onsense

of perversion, iniquity, misguid-
ed cynicism, and decay.

Well, I exagerate. The above
characteristics, are far more ap-
plicable to R.H. Crumm, the
producer of ZAP Commic and
Fritz‘the Cat, an X rated bit
of animated nonsense that at-
tacked with equally vapid bru-
tality every facet of our society.

To say that a film has no re-
deeming qualities is a strong
statement, but this I’m afraid, is
true of Fritz, a movie that was
racist, sexist, and yes even fas-
cist, to an extent that was only
surpassed by the degree to which
it was dull.

I’ll tell the story, because no
one who reads this (I I/iope) will
want to go see the absurdities
of the film—it portrays the story
of a cat-student at New York
University, who, after loosing
faith in the process of American
education (as admittedly we all
sometimes do), goes out to seek
the real world, first in Harlem
and then in transit across the
country. -

raping crows and smoking mari-
juana with aardvarks who intend
to take over the world by blow-

ing up a power plant, form a sort
of building roman, yet it differs
from that classic art-form, in
that the protagonist never learns
anything, never feels anything,
and in fact is the same person at
the conclusion as at the begin-
ning.

And yet this is unfair, for I
ignore the basic fact of Crumm’s
crummy (excuse the pun, but its
unavoidable) film, for it is about
animals and not people. The idea
seems somewhat novel, and yet it
is as effectively useless in this
film as it was in George Orwell’s
Animal Farm.

The association with Orwell’s
famous bit of anti-communist

garble-di-gook is perhaps a fel- ,

icitous one, since this movie like
its genre predecessor, sets up a
straw horse, namely our society,
and takes it down with amazing
efficiency.

Fritz could be called an alle-
gory of American life, like Or-
well’s Animal Farm it is an alle-
gory of revolution. Yet Crumm’s
movie lacks even the stylistic
appeal of that vacuous novel, and
is easily reduced to the level of
obscene triviality.

Record Quickies

Argent —- ALL TOGETHER NOW (Epic) — It’s not as good as
they are live, but then again, few could be. There’s little that can
be faulted here. “Hold Your Head Up,” of course, is included,
along with “Be My Lover, Be My Friend,” and a four-part piece
sentimentally titled “True Love.” It’s British rock near its best.

Allman Brothers —— EAT A PEACH (Capricorn) — dedicated to
the late Duane Allman, this two-record set is truly a peach. Duane
and Dicky Betts get off some superior licks in “Little Martha,”
and a super-long version of “Mountain Jam.” “Melissa” is a softer
tune, not quite what you’d expect from the Brothers. A good hard
rock album, and one you ought to have, if you don’t already.

OHIO KNOX (Reprise) — Somehow, when- Dallas Taylor and
Paul Harris weren’t backing up John Sebastian and Stephen Stills
and whoever else asked them to, they got together with Peter Gall-
way and Ray Neapolitan and made a pretty good album. Peter wrote
all the songs, including such gems as “Baby Sox Knox,” and “Pound
or my Dog Dad for Robert Downey (a prince) .”

The Hollies — LDISTANT LIGHT — (Epic) ~ This is Allan
Clarke’s last album with the group he co-founded back in the early
60’s, as he’s decided to go solo. And karma only knows if the
group can find a new lead singer that will be as good as Allan
was (just think—could you tell the difference between he and Gra-
ham Nash? few can). One of the summer’s great rockers is includ-
ed—“Long Cool Woman in a Black Dress,” as well as “Pull Down
the Blind,” and “Little Thing Like Love.” It’s a good album to have.

The Guess Who —- ROCKIN’ — (RCA) —- Remember the ballad
of Running Bear and Little White Cloud — the poor lovers who tried
to swim across the river to each other and drowned? Well, you
ain't heard nuttin’ till you heard the Guess Who rock it up—it’s
worth the entire price of the album. Unfortunately, the rest of the al-
bum isn't up to the same level—they’ve gone downhill since Randy
Bachman left them after “American Woman.” If you like to buy

The first six Pitt Panther foot-

son were far from happy ones for
any Pitt booster who attended

would feel compelled to ask the
same dismal questions like. "Why
couldn’t Pitt put together a win
this week?" or "How was it that
the Panthers fumbled and liter-
ally turned_ over their chances of
winning the game again?"

And always there were the hope-
ful answers by the Panther head
coach Carl DePasqua—never any

_ excuses for what had happened.

en the chance, the Cats would

Xesterday afternoon at the lat-

was changed—and for good rea-

Pitt had finally gotten their
chance to show what they could do

and it showed that it could win. In

a fourth quarter surge last week-
end. the Panthers blasted the Bos-
ton College Eagles. 35-20.

The smiles and the calm atmos-
phere at the luncheon was a testi-
mony to this initial victory of the
Panthers‘ this year.

“What more can I say that I
haven’t already said after the
game,” beamed DePasqua. “It

It was a very dismal afternoon at the University of Akron
two weeks ago. The Akron Zips were literally toying with the
Pitt soccer squad," displayings their international talents while
calmbly containing any threat that Pitt could manage to mount.
One though obviously came to mind: What on earth was Pitt
doing on the same field with a team of international all-stars?

Another question was inevitably raised: If Pitt had any seri-

ous hopes of obtaining an invitation to the NCAA playoffs, why
don’t they field a team similar to schools like Akron and Cleve-

land State?
(5.

The answer should be clear and might be considered as an
old story here at Pitt. The name of the game is money. It is a
definite fact that all sports that do not bring in revenue are then

dependent almost entirely on funds brought in by the football

team. It’s another definite fact that, at the present time, all
sports at this University other than football do not bring in any
noteworthy amounts of revenue. . ‘

Therefore, all sports are then dependent on the football
team for the am'ount of funds, allocated to them. Now when col-
lege.’s football team is receiving national television coverage
and visiting a holiday bowl frequently, then the ‘rest of the sports
reap the dividends. Needless to say, the Pitt football team . . . .

But that is not the definite rule for" the major soccer col-
leges in the‘ country. Who ever heard of the Howard football
team or the St. Louis football team? No, those schools are ath-
letically geared to soccer, being their number one sport. In fact.
Cleveland State doesn’t have football in their varsity athletic
program.

That leaves Pitt somewhere in the middle. Pittsburgh is
definitely a school where football is the major sport, but doesn't
have the funds to build a solid soccer program with a number

of foreign recruits, such as Pen_n State has ,been able to do in

recent years. -

On the other hand, soccer isnot and perhaps never will be
the major sport at Pitt. The game of soccer itself isn’t even that
popular in Western Pennsylvania. Schools such, as Temple and
Cleveland are located in areas where there is extensive soccer
systems with solid foundations in high schools and even on the
sandlots. There are no schools in the city of Pittsburgh that car-
ry soccer as a varsity sport. P

With’ insufficient funds to recruit a team of international

.Qplayers or, for that matter, wage a recruiting battle with col-‘

leges sch as Temple, the future of soccer at Pitt has been
brighter. Regardless, Pitt coach Leo Bemis has used the talent
available to build respectable teams and. forsees a ray of hope
in the quality of Pitt teams to come.

Bemis recruits the majority of his players from the West-
ern Pennsylvania area and plans to keep -on doing the same
thing. The strategy behind this is the fact that, although pro-'
fessional soccer didn’t last long in Pittsburgh, the high schools
in the suburbs of the city are beginning to field soccer teams
and those that have them are producing better players every
year. -

“I think'it’s bound to improve,” Bemis remarked. “It’s not
going to happen overnight, but in the next five years it will de-
velop.” I ._ - . ‘

Meanwhile, the Pitt soccer team itself has voted unani-

mously to continue ‘playing those international a1l—stars.‘ , _ '

BC center untouched and went
54 yards for a touchdown.

“For the first minute I couldn’t
believe that I was out in the open,”
related the happy gridder.

Panther Bruce Murphy was also
slated to be present at the lunch-
eon but was unable to attend as
he was undergoing treatment for
an injury.

Murphy, who accordingito De- V

Pasqua ‘is _"the other half of the
touchdown twins" (Wilson being

i the first half). also played a ma-

jor role in scoring points for the
Pantherson Saturday.

Early in the fourth quarter Mur-
phy flagged down a 10 yard touch-
down pass from quarterback John
Hogan“ and then, with only min-
utes remaining in the contest, he
skirted left and broke away from
everyone down the sidelines for a
60-yard touchdown run. '

"I can’t remember that sort of
breakaway running since Paul
Martha and Rick Leeson in 1963.“

DePasqua commented after the
game.

The Panther mentor also spot»
ted Hogan. Stan Ostrowski and
Jim Buckmon as having perform-
ed exceptionally against Boston
College. , -

Hogan did a good job for us,”
stated DePasqua. “And I'm es-
pecially happy that he completed
a full game for us without getting
hurt.” _ r

DePasqua also praised Ostrow—
ski's showing against the BC
Eagles. Ostrowskiracked up 101
yards on 25 carries for two Pitt
touchdowns and was named the
game's outstanding player. '

Defensively. Buckmon was De-

Pasqua's shining star. “Buckmon.

came up with the big play. the
key interception that gave us the
opportunity to additional points."
said DePasqua'of Buckmon’s in-
terception which them made Wil-

“The interception by No. 84
(Jim Buckmon) killed us,”. re-
ported Boston College’s head
coach Joe Xukica after the con-
test. “It was a hard fought game
and Pitt deserved the win.”

The happy Panther gridders"
and their fans will certainly agree

ment. '

Willie Jeffries

by VINCE Di NARDO
Sports Editor

A football coach who blurts out unorthdox
phraes like “right on” and can be observed in-

structing while his arm is arched around an ath- -

letes shoulder is indeed no typical run-of-the-mill-
coach. ' -

Willie Jeffries is not the yelling. head knock-
ing breed of football coach. .

Instead, he’s part of the new breed of tutor tha
has been making it big the last few years. He's no
father image either. A" highly intelligent man who
goes about his business in a like manner—that's_
Willie Jeffries. I

Jeffries is one of the two new coaches hired
by Carl DePasqua at the beginning of the year.
(The other is Chuck Gottfried.) He comes from
North Carolina A&T, where" he served as assistant
coach and defensive co-ordinator for five years. ’

L Handling players more like a psychiatrist might
_handle a patient, Jeffries speaks very softly. but

apparently carries a big message. as his players ~

have been responding to him favorably.

Jeffries ‘has the job of managing the heaviest
and the strongest group of Pitt footbll pla-_vers—
the defensive line. At his disposal, Jeffries has nine
players who weigh an accumulative total of 2.079
pounds. That‘s a lot of human beef in anyone‘s
language. ' k

However, Willie never views his players that
way, and more important, nor does’ he coach them
accumulatively. ‘

"I think there is an advantage in coaching in-
dividuals," he said: "When I‘m dealing with an ex-
trovert ball player. I have to‘ be stronger as a coach.
When I have a withdrawn player. I have to handle
him differently, too. Why, there are two guys I

coach that I have to yell at occasionaly because they-

were brought up under different family cultures."

On the whole, the 34 year old mentor. who is
doing a more specialized job at Pitt than he was-do-
ingat A&T. would rather never yell at all.

‘.‘Once you yell, I think you have to keep yell-
_ing.,I try _to minimize my yells. I don’t believe that

and they know I’m going to be fair,” he said,’r"e*rr_i-Q

  
   
  
  
   
  
   
  
    
  
   

yelling at a guy can help him learn anything, any
way. In fact, I think they appreciate my style as,-
long as‘ they understand my basic characteristics "I

iniscent of a high school professor a certain writer
used to have. ‘

So in his very quiet tone. hisforehegtd assum”
ing wrinkled proportions. Willie first views a prac _
tice session with his big black eyes and then goes;
about instructing his boys on what they did wrong.-V.‘
often with a waving index finger. ' . 

With his short trimmed hair. Jeffries look
like a dark Italian. instead of a black. Racially too. 
Jeffries maintains his intelligent outlook. -'

“If-a black player has a problem, I would" lilgev
to talk to him as one black adult to another. But, in‘
door is open to anyone who wants to talk, bla(_:k».or:
white.” _ ' fl - 1

Willie Jeffries is themost unique of all Pi't~t;.
coaches. Aside from his different field techniques.-."
it should be noted that Willie doesn‘t even say god
dammit. _ g - i

Buck-Most Consistent Gridder

by VINCE Di NARDO
Sports Editor
Someday Pitt standout deten-
sive end Jim Buckmon hopes to
become a teacher. If he makes it

and his students learn with the

same consistency by which he is
learning as a student of college
football today. Buckmon will
earn himself a
"teacher of the
year“ award. _
But that‘s in "V

the future. Pre— Z
sently Buckmon
is concerned
with learning
more fundamen-
tals. And. he is 
learning rather BUCKMQN
well.

‘ made a lot of mistakes last
year. phew." he said taking time
out from the Laugh—In comedy
hour. "I think I‘ve had a good year
so far because of the experience
l've gotten and because of coach
iChucki Gottfried. He showed me

 
 
 
   

techniques 1 never used last
year."

Gottfried, who believed in Buck-
mon from the very first minute he
laid eyes on him, readily agrees.

"Buck has a fine mental per-
spective. Hes strong. hes got the
quickness (4.8 in the 40 yard
dash). he's well balanced. has
good control of his body and can
mix it up with the big ones.“ Gott-
fried said in rapid succession.
"Hes a 70 per cent better player
than he was in fall practice.

"There are only two ways he
wont be great by the time he
leaves here. If he doesn't want it
01‘ if I don‘t do the job coaching
him."

Buckmon, a Washington, D. C.,
native, has had a good game in all
seven Pitt contests. Despite the
fact that the team lost six of
them. He has even looked good
when he’s gotten blocked out of
plays.

"He hasn‘t had a bad game for

fried. "He has improved despite
the losing situation. wliicli is a
credit to him as well as to any
good football player.

"Xou know. all the coaching in
the world cant help a guy if he
doesnt have it in here." tlottfried
said. pointing to the general area
of the heart.

Jim Buckmon has it in “here.”

"If nothing else.“ continued
tlottfried. who seemed to want to
talk about Buck all day. "hes
learned a great lesson in life.“

At 238 pounds, the physical ed-
ucation major hopes for all the
things that a football player would
want. He would like national rank-
ing for his team. bowl bids. which
seem to be slightly out of reach
for this year. and to be the num-
ber one team in the area.

Through all this, Buckmon is
not to‘ be confused with Duane
Thomas of the San Diego Charg-
ers (I think). Trying to get Buck-
mon to toot his own horn is simi-
lar to getting Spiro Agnew to laud
anti-war hecklers.

So. If Buckmon is so good. why

Being only a freshman, it would
be a bit premature to compare
Pitt’s freshman running backs,

‘Ted Berrien and Calvin Branch,

to Larry Csonka and Jim Kick.
But the two do show several sim-
ilarities which cannot be overlook-
ed.

One of these similarities is the
close friendship that the two have
off the field. Like the Dolphin’s
duo, the two had never met until
they became teammates. Berrien-
and Branch met on the first day of
football registration, Aug. 18. and
have been close ever since.

Another outstanding trait the
two possess is "their quickness
"They're both real good, hard
runners,” remarked. assistant
coach Dan Lynn, "They have good
speed and a lot of second effort.

I TDERRIEN
_ Larry Czonka?

Branch, a six-foot, 190 pounder,
from Hartford, Conn., came to
Pitt as an honor .roll student in
high school, and one of the things
that led him to choose Pitt was
the high number of Panther grid-
ders that go on to graduate school.
He was Pitt’s last recruit.

Berrien, who played football
and basketball for Peabody High
School, here in Pittsburgh, chose
Pitt because “I wanted to stay
close to home; my mother is
sick.”

The duo has seen little action in
the varsity games, with Berrien in
t'or kickoffs in the Boston College
game, and Branch not yet making
it off the sideli-nes. The BC kicker
never kicked the ball near Ber-
rien, maybe he had noticed his
speed in pre-gamewarmups.

Both of them have been very

instrumental in the junior varsity
games, with Berrien once again
seeing more action. In the Mary-
land game, Berrien ran 14 times
for 75 yards, ai5.4 xard average,
while Bran_ch carried nine times
for 38 yards a 4.2 yard average.

“We didn’t use Branch too much
until the end, to run out the
Clock,” smiled Lynn. “But he kept
gaining five or six yards a carry
and we kept getting first downs."

In the West Virginia game. Pitt
used a number of running backs.
and neither Branch nor Berrien

On one play, the two teamed up to

Berrien and Branch are both
satisfied with the progress they
are making, although they wish
the junior varsity had more
games. They hope to get into
some varsity games this year,
but they realize that the chances
of this happening are not good.

“I hope to get into some games
this year," said Branch, “But if
I don’t, spring drills is where I'll
get my chance."

“When asked what they were
looking forward to in the next

three years at Pitt,." Branch stat- _

ed flatly, “To start on the varsi-
