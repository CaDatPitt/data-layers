i-Kaps help handicapped  

By Marc Wallace

For The Pitt News

There is a great demand for bet-
ter living environments for the se-
verely handicapped. But because
of the high cost of modifying liv-
ing quarters, non—profit institu-

tions find it very difficult to.

finance them.

One organization has taken
this demand upon itself — the Pi
Kappa Phi fraternity. Through its
own national service project,

Play Units for the Severely Han-
dicapped, the fraternity has been
contributing to the needs of the
handicapped since 1975.
Kenneth N. Kaiser, National
Assistant Director of PUSH, said,
”Because of the government's tax
laws, we offer a means for the in-
stitutions to acquire these much

needed and unfortunately very»

expensive [between 15 and 20
thousand dollars] play en-
vironments.”

Thomas H. Sayre, founder and

designer of the PUSH environ-
ment said that the units are based
"simply on the importance of en-
vironment on human beings.”

The PUSH play unit is designed

to withstand the rigors of institu-

tional life, while also, as Ken.

Kaiser points out, ’’enabling the
child to experiment — act on
his/her own, in a comfortable and
accessible enviroment.”

Top judges to hear

By Anita Huslinl

Associated Press Writer

PHILADELPHIA — Topjudges
from the 13_original states will get
a rare opportunity to hear the lay-
man's views about the Constitu-
tion during a ceremonial session
this week, a spokesman for the
‘Philadelphia Bar Association said
Tuesday.

The -chief justices from the
supreme courts of 11 states and

the top judges of the Maryland A

Daniel A. Cirucci, communica-

The justices’ visit to ‘Philadel-
phia is‘ in honor of the 200th an-
niversary of the signing of the
U.S. Constitution.

"Everything that has been ac- I

complished has been as a result
of that document, and without it,_
the security of those accomplish-

The president declined to
say whether any progress was
made on_ arms control or other
subjects in the first round of

' talks" between Shultz and
Shevardnadze. ”We’re just be
ginning,” the president said,
seated next to the Soviet
minister in the Oval Office.

Shevardnadze declined to
tell reporters what was in the
letter from Gorbachev. ’’If I tell

' you, what shall I tell the presi-
dent?" he said.

Asked if it proposed a sum-
mit date, he said, ”No date,
but a summit is necessary."

Earlier, after nearly three
hours of discussions at the
State Department, Shultz said,
”We had a very good meeting
between the minister and I —
thorough and constructive."’

The Soviet foreign minister,
reflecting a mutually upbeat
mood, joked to reporters and
photographers: ”We have
come here in order to tell you
that the ministers have decid-
ed everything.”

As Shevardnadze opened
his three—day visit, there were
signs of flexibility in the U.S.

effort to nail down a treaty to

ban intermediate-range
nuclear missiles and to reduce
more potent strategic arsenals,
as well.

Shevardnadze flashed a
thumbs—up sign upon his ar-
rival and said he was in a
”good” mood. Then, as he left
for a brief respite at the Soviet
embassy before a White
House meeting with President
Reagan, he said he felt ”OK.”

Shultz declined, however,
to clear up what was on every-
one’s mind: Whether they had
discussed a ' date for Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev
to come here to see Reagan.

Parking a problem

By Merritt Neale Ir.
For The Pitt News

Parking has never been an easy
task for University of Pittsburgh
students. The outlook appears
dismal for a remedy to the short-
age of parking spaces that occurs
between certain hours in
Oakland.

In the university vicinity there
are approximately 12 parking fa-
cilities, the majority of which are
owned and operated by private-
ly run companies.

The university itself owns
several lots which are operated
by the William Penn Parking Co.
These lots are specifically for

aboveground section will be the

JTJHE PITT News, weanesday, sepigmberiis, I987

FRANKFURT, West Germany — Hack-
ers broke into NASA’s worldwide com-
puter network throughout the summer
and gathered secret data on space shut-
tle projects and rocket failures, West Ger-
man media said Tuesday.

News reports said young West Ger-
mans gained regular access to at least 20
computers of the U.S. space agency and
had the ability to paralyze the entire
network.

The ARD television network said a flaw
in the network's security system allowed
the hackers to enter the network from
May to September.

The NASA system connects more than
1,600 computers worldwide that share in-
formation on space research, nuclear
physics and molecular biology, ARD said.
The network includes U.S. atomic
research facilities in Los Alamos, N.M.

The Hamburg-based magazine Stern
reported similar information.

”When.I saw ‘Welcome to the NASA
headquarters
screen, I was a little shocked, to say the
least,” the magazine quoted one youth as
saying.

The Hamburg—based ”Chaos Computer
Club” said in a ‘statement to news media
Tuesday that the youths turned to the club
for help when they realized the enormi-
ty of their discovery. '

The statement said the hackers penetrat-
ed the network to show the ”unbeIieva-
ble weaknesses" of the security system
and had no interest in the secret data.

-The reports did not say how many
hackers were involved or where they
lived.

UN head returns from trip

BAGHDAD, Iraq -— The United Na-

, tions’ chief ended his Persian Gulf peace

mission Tuesday, saying he discussed
”the outline of a plan” to implement a
Security Council resolution calling for a
cease-fi re in the 7-year-old Iran—Iraq war.

But Secretary—General Javier Perez de
Cuellar gave no indication, before he flew
out of Baghdad for New York, of how suc-
cessful his quest had been. '

Perez de Cuellar spent two days talk-
ing with top Iranian government leaders
in Tehran, then flew to the Iraqi capital
Sunday night for talks with President Sad-
dam Hussein, Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz
and other senior Iraqis.

He is to report Wednesday to the Secu-

Report says hackers broke into NASA secrets.-.

rity Council on his mission.

Aziz declared after Perez de Cuellar left
that Iran ”has rejected the resolution and
is playing the game of gaining time.”

He insisted that the council's July 20
resolution must be implemented ”in let-
ter and spirit,” with an arms embargo and
other sanctions imposed on Iran for fail-
ing to abide by the reso|ution's pro-
visions.

Tehran radio, monitored in Nicosia,
Cyprus, quoted Prime Minister Hussein
Musavi as declaring: "The days when
arms embargoes and economic sanctions
had any effect on our resolve or war ef-
fort are over.

”We’re now able to produce our own
requirements, to a large extent, in the
country. This, in addition to the
martyrdom-seeking spirit inherent in our
people enables us to manage the war as
well as our economy.”

Pope arrives in Los Angeles
and tells people -not to fret

LOS ANGELES — Pope John Paul II ar-
rived in the nation's largest Roman
Catholic archdiocese Tuesday, urging his
followers to keep the faith in a ’’secular-
rized world” that is ”indifferent, if not
hostile, to a Christian morality.”

A crowd estimated by police at

200,000 lined the seven-mile route of the 
motorcade that took the pope from Los 
Angeles International Airport to St.” Vibi- f
ana’s Cathedral, where he will stay dur- 1
ing his two-day stop. That figure was far 
smaller than advance predictions of up to I 

two million by the archdiocese. _
John Paul flew here from Phoenix,

Ariz., where he took part in a meeting’ 
Monday evening with a tiny but devout-_; ,j
ly faithful segment of his flock — Ameri-‘ 

can Indians.

Before departing from Sky Harbor Air-I _.
port this morning, the pontiff walked over 

to a crowd of about 2,000 people, kissed
and hugged several little children, picked
one up, and waved to everyone.

Earlier, the pope had visited with ter—_' 
minally ill children in a Phoenix hospi-t 

tal, hoping to comfort them andtheir
families in their struggle. ‘

' Smaller than expected crowds have » i

been lining the streets to see the pontiff
so far on his cross-coun_try'travels, but a

Vatican spokesman said the pope “is 
”general|y pleased” with his audiences.‘ *

In remarks prepared for an audience of A
church and governmental officials at the‘ 
cathedral, the pope said being a Christian, ff-
in a ”secularized world can bring op— — *7
position and even ridicule. _ ~ .

groups with the PLO.

Hasan Rahman said the letter
had "arrived at the Palestine Infor-
mation Center late in the day, af-
ter conflicting reports had
surfaced about closing the office.

”|t’s an ambiguous, confusing
and confused‘ letter,” Hasan said,
refusing to divulge the contents. "
He said he would be consulting
lawyers on the legality of the ac-
tion and would hold a news con-
ference Wednesday in the PLO’s
office, despite the order.

The State Department's deci-
sion was disclosed earlier Tues-
day by republican Rep. Jack
Kemp of. New York, who issued
a statement praising the depart-
ment: Sen. Charles Grassley, R-
Iowa, also predicted the closing.

Abraham H. Foxman, national 

director of the Anti-Defamation
League of B’nai B'rith, called the
closing ”a significant step for-
ward in the ongoing struggle
against terrorism.”
L Rahman maintained it ”would
be absolutely illegal and uncon-
stitutional” for the State Depart-
ment to close the PLO offices.

Morton H. Halperin, ‘spokes-
man for the American Civil Liber-
ties Union, said his group also
believed the action was uncon-
stitutional and planned to fight it.

Tongue-kissing is not a critical

the teeth were made of pep-
permint.

And as for where you can find
out about it, why, in his arms is
the right place. V

Q: I have herpes, haven't had
an outbreak in years, but when
I told him belatedly, I admit he

dumped me. This was a guy I

really cared about and it hurts me
a lot. What can I do?
A: Get another lover and tell

V him before having sex with him.

I am not making up a fairy tale,
I know_ lots of people who have
herpes and who have told their-
lovers before having sex, and the
relationship has progressed to sex
and beyond to serious commit-
ment. They have to go to a doc-
tor together and be instructed in
avoiding transmission. They have
to learn about childbirth with
herpes. This is not an insurmount-
able barrier to love or marriage.
Herpes, the terror and plague
and media favorite of a few years
back, is not the end of life or love.
Someone who loves and values
you will take a rational view of
your having herpes even if you
should have regular outbreaks,
which you say you don't. And I
believe you — it does happen.
All right, this is the guy you
want, and you don't want to

dump him. Show him this;

column, or mail it to him with a
note. Maybe he really hopes

there is a way to be with you. It

is worth risking rejection to let
him know the medical facts.

_ There are many nice people who
have herpes. It is an infection, a '

medical fact, not a sign of bad
character any more than having

had some other kind of accident. V

A person of value can be loved
in spite of herpes, can form a
valued attachment or get married.

Ifthe man you want right now
does not understand this mes-
sage, don’t condemn yourself be-
cause of that. There are other
men who will value you and who
will accept the strictly medical
facts in the case.

Q:My husband is having an af-
fair that I know all about./\t a
party at her house recently, the

_ woman involved jumped on him,

pushed him down, lay on top of
him and said, ”Let’s go upstairs
and get it on.” In front of every-—

. one. Then they did just that. Ifelt
« awkward and embarrassed. What

should I have done?

A: Even though you had con-
doned the affair, even though,
knowing about it, you went to a
party at her house, still I consider
that unacceptable behavior. You
would have been justified in leav-
ing without thanking the hostess.
In the morning, a phone call to
a divorce lawyer would have
been in order — not to a sex ther-
apist, which is my field. But I
can't help wondering what,you
did do —- unprofessional,

perhaps,‘but I do wonder.

Gary Vincent    
Three blocks is a world away

By Paul Anater

Staff Writer

The Pittsburgh Symphony ad-
vertises that it has the ”Music
Cure.” Denny's,’ a small bar on
Louisa Street in South Oakland,
could easily claim to have discov-
ered the cure for pop culture.

The main ingredient in
Denny's remedy is a 33-year-old
musician named Gary Vincent.
”|t’s possible to entertain without
being a performer; I try to do
both,” he said.

He stands on a stage in the
corner. His acoustic guitar in
hand, his harmonica hanging
from his neck and his fiddle rest-
ing atop a stack of empty beer
cases by his side. The bar is filled
to capacity. People sit on
benches, or more likely, stand in
front of the stage.

He begins. _

The Grateful Dead, Cat
Stevens, Jimmy Buffett, James
Taylor, Neil Young, Van Morri-
son as well as his original com-
positions fill the night. A few
brave souls request that he play
his fiddle and then test their en-
durance by ”stomping.” From
everywhere come the sounds of
good people having a great time.

Three blocks away, people
trapped in the rest of the Oakland
bars stand like sardines while the
noise of Bon Jovi and Run DMC
keeps them quiet.

Gary Vincent was born in
Chicago. He earned a regent’s
degree» in music from West
Liberty College in Wheeling,

By Michele Kiraly

Assistant Entertainment Editor

Here's a bit of art history that's
quite interesting and known even
less. Around 1900, Carnegie
museum's director of fine arts be-
gan purchasing drawings by later
19th century artists, using funds
provided by founder Andrew
Carnegie.

J

  
   

”The Gossips” by Honore Daumier is one of ‘the drawings on display at the Carnegie’s latest showing.

W.Va., where he studied classi-
cal voice. He started out at West’
Liberty as a computer science
major, but after his freshman
year, changed to music.

’ He stayed in Wheeling for a
few years after graduation, where
he played with a Coun-
try/Bluegrass band named the
Castleman Run Band. After five
years with them, he went solo
and moved to Pittsburgh. From

Pittsburgh, he's jumped to Cape _

May, back to Wheeling, to Hunts-
ville, Ala., and finally, to Nash-
ville, Tenn.

He now divides his time be-
tween all of those places but
makes his home in Nashville,
where. he hopes to break into
Country music as a singer and
songwriter.

In the past, he's sold songs to
Leon Redbone and Mickey Gil-
ley. As this article is being writ-
ten, a song sung -by John
Anderson and written by Gary
Vincent is working its way up
Billboard's Country chart. Vin-
cent is going to make it, and in
his words, ’’I’m not going to com-
promise good music for air time."

That sounds odd, coming from
a man who hopes to make a
career in a field that specializes
in flashes in the pan.

The crowd here is out of the or-
dinary, to say the least. Vincent
said, ”People are here to have
fun. They're tired of the same old
crap they hear on the radio. I
make an honest presentation. I
am what I am. The people who
come here are honest in that

John Beatty, then director, fa-
vored the drawing styles French

artists used in the mid to late

1800s. He liked the rich and
complex materials they chose.
He admired the way in which
these mediums permitted the ar-
tists’ own versality while showing
individual disciplines.

The fruit of Beatty’s labor as a
collector is currently exhibited in

respect, too.”

The people here are indeed
having fun. They seem more like
a group of old friends than a
crowd at a bar. Virtually every-
one is singing along or dancing.

Three blocks away, a fight
breaks out because someone
spilled a beer on someone’s girl-
friend. ‘ ’

He’s been playing at Denny's
for five years. According to
Denny" Byrd, owner, ”He’s an
honest, sincere person. He gives
1 10 percent every night he plays.
He's a wonderful human being in
addition to being a wonderful
performer.”

Also, according to Denny, bus-
iness goes up measurably when
Gary's playing. Said Bartender

_ Jackie Byrd, ’’It’s a great night to

work. You work your butt off, but
it's a great night to work.”

Denny's Bar is a refreshing
change of pace from the rest of
the Pitt bars and clubs. Its small
size and distance from campus
have maintained that difference.

It's uncommon for a performer
to say this about a club where he
plays, but Vincent said, “When
I get a night off, the last thing I
want to do is come to a bar, but
I do end up here often.”

If you're looking for ferns, yup-
pies, superficiality on tap and Top
40, this place isn't for you- If
you're looking for honest people,
quality live entertainment, beer in
longneck bottles, a huge aquari-

um, a polite staff and a hell of a’

night out, you'll definitely fit in.
Three blocks away 

Carnegie’s museum of art. The
show, titled 19th Century Euro-

This man offers an alternative to the typical Oakland night out. His dis-
tinctive style of music is a refreshing change. '

Carnegie’s 19th-century drawings rich in diversity  

American drawings resembled
their counterparts both in intima-
cy and stylistic sophistication.

Although the collection is
primarily European, American ar-
tists Winslow Homer and James
Abbott McNeill Whistler have
pieces included in the collection.

Many drawings are composed
on paper, using either charcoal,
graphite or ink. ”Benjamin Page”
is a portrait done in graphite,
charcoal and chalk on paper by
American artist ‘John James
Audobon.

Another portrait is composed.
on paper with graphite by French
romanticist Jean-Auguste-
Dominque Ingres. This work,
signed and dated by the artist, is
a portrait of a fair-skinned young
man done with simple lines and
quick sketching.

The graphite blends easily to
create shadows for the character's
collar and the area around his
eyes.

Probably the longest name of
an artist is Karl-Ernest-Rodolphe
-Heinrich-Salem Lehmann. The ti-
tle of one of his exhibited works
matches his name in length:
”Study for the Ceiling of the
Hotel de Ville, Paris.” Composed
on paper with crayon and paste,
this piece is.a sketch of cherubs
in rust and sky blue with a fine
black line intersecting the circu-
lar frame.

A The background of this work
makes it look _like it could have

 

been drawn on a brown paper‘

bag. Don't deny the quality of
this peice; rather, consider that
Lincoln's Gettysburg Address was
thought to have been-written on

the back of an‘ envelope. Art ‘'

comes out of some strange
mediums. ,

A drawing by France's Luc-
Olivier Merson has a metallic
glow. Perhaps it's the piece’s
bronze frame that gives this hue,
or it could be the work itself done
with copper and gray chalk.

”Peace” is the title of American
artist Gary Melchar’s crayon and
charcoal compostion of four
figures. This drawing is a study for
mural decorations in the Library
of Congress that shows two pairs
of figures in a solemn walk, cast
in gray and red. ’

A reminiscence of the Ameri-
can Old West is captured in
Robert Swain .Gifford's "Old
Trees.” One notices, in the piece,
the cowboy hat or sombrero
worn by a man reclining under a
row of trees situated ina prairie.

The English countryside and
French landscapes are the subject
for several works in the collec-
tion. Charles-Emile Jacque uses
black chalk and watercolor on
tan paper to create subtle pastel
shades of a farmer tending his
flock. Vibrant green grass, the
farmer's blue shirt and dark win-
dow sills are the result of water-
colors on this work.

Dirty Dancing j ‘ '
Movie Soundtrack

» First off, I didn't see the movie.
Maybe that is a better way to
review a movie soundtrack, so
images of the film don't keep

. popping up when you listen to

the record.

For instance, every time I hear
Berlin's Take My Breath Away I
always get - visions of Kelly

.r

. ..

McGuillis being molested _by
Tom Cruise. If I were to listen to
these songs after viewing Dirty
Dancing, I think I would get a lot

, of distorted images.

This LP mixes songs from the

’. early '60s with new material in an

effort which (not without intent)
sounds like two movie sound-
tracks.

Old-time rock classics such as
”Be My Baby” by the Ronettes,
”Stay” by Maurice Williams and

real soundtrack?

  'the‘lZodiacs and ”ln ‘the Stilllof

the Night” by The Five Stains are
smushed right in next to stuff writ-
ten and recorded in 1987, syn-
thesizers and all.

The old songs are performed by

the original recording artists, and

a few were recorded when sound
studioshad yet to hear the word
”stereo.” Subsequently, while the
music sounds great, there is an
obvious disparity between the
old and the new.

But in this case, the old
definitely comes out as the win-
ner. Even with the prehistoric
recording techniques, producers
like Phil Spector knew how to get
the right sound on vinyl.

Today, it seems like producers
are bent on making music with
lots of noise reduction, with the
result being c-rystal—clear sound.
But it doesn't matter how clear
the music is, you still need good
material. (I'm great at stating the
obvious.) L

The new songs on the Dirty

Dancing soundtrack aren’tal| that ' L

bad, they just don't sound like

- songs fromthe '60s. Not that that
was the artists’ intent, but it

sounds |ike_Budd‘y Holly meets

of an old song, ”You Don't Own

New season is the same old thing

By David Ballarotto
Staff Writer

The new sitcom Frank's
Place debuted Monday night
on CBS, and although it will
no likely get better, it is a good
example of what's been wrong
with most CBS sitcoms over
the past few years.

For instance, most CBS sit-
coms of late have had to deal
with some sort of "twist."
Here the twist is a Boston
professor called Frank, played
by actor and series co-creator
Tim Reid. Frank has just ac-
quired a Cajun restaurant way
down yonder in New Orleans.

Next, a CBS sitcom needs
“zanies” to populate the set-
ting. This show has plenty: a
woman mortician, Hanna
(played by Reid's wife Daphne
Maxwell Reid), a voodoo prac-
titioner Madame Torchet
(Frances E. Williams) and so

on and so torth.
Apparently, the show will
center on the romance be-

A tween Frank and Hanna. The

characters seem interesting,
but unfortunately, Monday's

show only set up the series’ sit- '
uation, and as a result, was

hard to sink one’s teeth into.

Another thing about this
show, that many no doubt will
praise,-. is it doesn't have a
laughtrack. This seems neces-
sary for this show, because it
doesn't try to be wildly funny,
just humorous. With only

V moderate comedy, the viewer

may think he missed some-
thing amusing.

What this program could

use is a live studio audience to .

give the actors, who are obvi-
ously dedicated to the show,
a source of feedback.

The program's regular slot is

Saturday at 8 p.m. on CBS.
Monday night also saw the

season premieres of Kate & Al--

lie, Newhart and Designing
Women. I

Kate & Allie's season opener
had a unique twist: set some-
time in the future, Chip and
his son came back to their old
house, about to be destroyed,
and talked about the time Chip
(Frederick Koehler) flunked
science. .

The unusual twist aside,
Monday night's episode
seemed a little tired, like the
characters needed a new situ-

ation. Hopefully the season ’

premiere is not indicative of
the rest of the season's shows.

Newhart, however, ap--

peared to have hit its stride
Monday night. The episode
dealt with Dick and Joanna
Loudon (Bob Newhartand

Mary Frann), handling a
16-year-old's crush on Joanna.

The show had a breath of
fresh air as it kept away from
the Vermont Today storyline
that had been bogging the ser-
ies down the last few years.

Fans of Newhart will no
doubt be pleased that the
show is still relyingprimarily
on intelligent comedy derived
from unique situations.

Designing lWomen also got_

off to a good start Monday. In
Monday's opener, Sugarbaker
and Associates held a room

make-over contest  won by .

a derelict.

The writing was still good,

the situationsinteresting, and-

best of all, the sense of

camaraderie between actress- -

es Dixie Carter, Delta Burke,
Jean Smart and Annie Potts.

Upon reading the editorial in
the Tuesday, Sept. 8, edition and
viewing the political cartoon in
the Wednesday, Sept. 9 edition
of The Pitt News about the Rev.
Jesse Jackson, a very significant
number of black students, com-
munity, faculty and administra-

tors have expressed outrage at the _

continuing insensitivity of the
editorial staff of The Pitt News.

MONIQUE
SIMS

First of all, the political cartoon
featuring the Rev. Jesse Jackson in
a leather jacket and an earring in
his ear, subtitled ”The outlook on
the next four years if this man is
elected president” was not a po-
litical cartoon at all. It was an out-
and—out attack on the man's

character and race.

The cartoon made no comment
on Rev. Jesse Jackson as a viable
politician or his political
philosophy but attacked him as a
black man with no substance.
The articles seemed to stereotype
him and associate him with a
black entertainer in an apparent
attempt to suggest that he is un-
worthy as a serious candidate
with an underlying suggestion
that blacks should be entertainers
and Rev. Jackson is not an enter-
tainer.

Secondly, the editorial on Sept.
8, which stated, and I quote, ”He
isa fool ..." referring to Jesse Jack-
son, was amateurish and a poor
choice of words and tends to
have some serious racial slurs.

Rev. Jackson's philosophy is
gaining coin among savants in
both parties. Two weeks ago,
Republican Governor Terry Bran-

stead feared that Southern
democrats would give the May
piimaries to Rev. Jackson.
Richard Gephardt and other

Democrats constantly pick up on »

Jackson's economic plans as a
viable’ alternative to Reaganom-
ics and other GOP policies.
After reading the editorial and
viewing the cartoon on Friday,
Sept. 1 1, six students had a meet-
ing with The Pitt News which we
thought was positive. At that
meeting, we discussed several
recommendations from the Black

Action Society — 'one of which.

was a printed apology or retrac-
tion from The Pitt News editorial
staff. However, no retraction,
apology or even a clear clarifica-
tion was printed after it was ac-
knoweledged by the staff that the
perception and choice of words
were at the least inappropriate.

Taking into account all of the

above, my points are the follow-

‘ ing:- a) it is obvious to all that The

Pitt News made an’ error;
however, instead of correcting it,
they asked the chairperson of the
Black Action Society to write a
guest column thus exonerating
themselves of the responsibility
of clarification; b) more blacks
are needed on the staff in order
to give input as to what may be
offensive to black students and
the black community; c) blacks’
have had enough with The Pitt
News constantly elaborating the

negative activities of the black‘

community.

We as black students will not
tolerate it any longer. All students
should be outraged at this type of

"character assassination — no mat-

ter who the target is. Hopefully,

we will nottsee any more articles I

or cartoons of such juvenile
content.

Spies, pot and somepossibilities

The National Security Council
stands accused by the Christic In-
stitute of having sold hard drugs
to raise money for combat sys-
tems. Reagan has proclaimed a
war on drugs. How does one
digest this contradiction?

 
I JAMES
CRARY

Having never sold drugs, not
since that grade school joint I
passed on for- 50 cents, it is
difficult for me, believing that pot
should be legalized, to put
together the answer. Money?~It
seems like the government would

be making more money if grass I

were legal; I, forone, will not buy
it until it is legal. There must be

 “ ‘V another reason why the govern-

   

ment is keeping hard drugs and
pot illegal together and selling
them through classified channels.

The answer, it seems, pertains
to the maintenance of civil con-
trol. The government distributes
these drugs through ghoulies to
people in gradeischool and high
school in order to discredit the
user. Once a user has smokedva
bowl, he is turned into a liar, or
else he is going to be discredited
when seeking higher office. The
people who are most likely to
give a joint a try or to take a drop
of LSD. are often the freest spirits,

‘people who want to make au-

tonomous decisions and who
have the most to offer creatively.

STOP SMOKING POT AND
LOBBY‘ ITS LEGALITY. Pot is
different from the other drugs in
that itis benign. LSD is-not be-

nign; it_ is a harrowing, terrifying
experience with florid visuals. It
is a chemical warfareagent. Pot
is kept on the same scale of legal-
ity precisely because its relative
insignificance deceives the user
into believing that other drugs are
not as bad as they are cut out to
be. Even if pot is kept illegal, as

perhaps such prohibition is
necessary, the controversy about ’

these issues cannot be legally sti-
fled, and to avoid a police state
we must discuss these issues.
There is a new chiefjustice on
the Supreme Court. There is also
a Pittsburgher named ‘Judge Bork
approaching the bench. Although
I believe thatthe new Judge is a
radical, right-‘wing extremist who
will destroy American, civil liber-
ties if given a chance, I do not
think‘ that we should fear him. He

may have changed a _little over

the years, and maybe he will
revert to his old ways and beliefs.-
I find it especially unlikely that
America can be subverted over-
all, even if AIDS is a bio-weapon
(which is probably an irrational.
concern anyway). The New Right
is not really that new. Their
values trace’-§beyon'd the‘Nation-
al Socialist movements of thg

1940s. They have the values of ' I

Attila.

Presume the worst. Suppose
that the NSC really is involved in
chemical ‘war (i.e. drug pushing)
against the United States. Pre-
sume that their agenda really
does mandate that guns-for-drugs
against the United States is a
moral imperative. Would it real-
ly seem so radical for me, a child-
victim of intense
experiences, to be so adamant.

Since Tuesday, Sept. 8, The Pitt
News has been under attack from
all ends of the spectrum, concern-
ing our editorial treatment of
Jesse Jackson as far as his
presidential aspirations go.

This paper decides editorial
opinions democratically. The edi-
tors get together, exchange ideas
on issues to be discussed in
editorials and then vote on which
position to take on each particu-
lar issue". , I

People have taken exception to
the cartoon showing Jesse Jack-
son dressed as Michael Jackson,

A saying that it wasn't a cartoon at

all but rather an attack on his
character and race.

An old wound rubbed open
I LETTSERSF

Your editorial "Jesse Jackson 4
promising recovery” was not
very professional to say the least.
The editorial gives you, the edi-
tor, a chance to express your op-
nions and make a statement
concerning issues of importance.
However, you went a step fur-
ther; you insulted some of the
readers whohappen to be Jack-
son supporters. -

Maybe if you had another can-_
didate to compare Jackson with
then your editorial wouldn't lack
substance. Because you failed to
include another candidate to use
in comparison to Jackson, you
missed your own point.

Remember, whether you are‘

writing a column or an editorial,
it would be to your advantage to
include both sides of an issue.
We, the readers, like and appreci-
ate hearing both sides. [...] ‘

' Since you took it upon yourself
to imply thatJackson isn't the best
candidate to vote for, I thinkyou
should have included your
choice. Your much-needed les-

l A The Pitt News, in its never-

ending‘ effort to stir controversy
definitely went beyond itself this
time.

Earlier this month The Pitt.
News ran a political cartoon
depicting Rev. Jesse Jackson in a
Michael Jackson dress-up. To The

Pitt News I_ ask — what is the —
_correIation_‘ betwe‘en -the two?» I...

 

 

Last fall, we ran an editorial
concerning the impending entry
of Pat Robertson into the
presidential race. We criticized
him for his statement that he had

been chosen by God to be our

next president. The cartoon that
day showed a hand reaching
down from heaven, touching
Robertson's hand, a la Michae-
langelo. Now, where was all the
mail criticizing us for our out-
and—out attack on Robertson as a

person‘ and for his religious,

beliefs?

Other criticisms have centered
on the Jackson cartoon and said
that through the cartoon, we
were in fact saying that black
people aren't fit for anything but
the entertainment industry. Read
into it what you feel you must,
but the reason Michael Jackson
wasichosen is that Michael Jack-
son and Jesse Jackson have the

‘ same last names. I suppose that's

too simple.

Someone else complained that
we don't present both sides of an
issue in our editorials. Our
numerous editorials concerning
the likes of Gary Hart, American
involvement in the Persian Gulf,
bag-checking policies at the
cafeteria, etc., have concerned
one issue and expressed the
majority editorial opinion on that

see this as a blatant personal at-
tack against Rev. Jackson.

It was nothing more than an ir-
responsible effort to discredit the
presidential hopeful. The cartoon
had no political relevance except
to make him appear as a clown
to the general public.

Furthermore, on Sept. 8 The
Pitt News ran an editorial read-
ing ”Jesse Jackson promising
recovery.” Many interesting and
controversial statements were
made. One such statement was
the comment about Rev. Jack-
son's proposed plan to alleviate
the foreign trade problem by
stiffening the trade policies. It is
true that a highly protectionist at-
titude, when taken to-the ex-
treme, ”is not one that greatly
enhances the image of a nation
with its trading partners.”

However,‘ a carefree attitude
toward trade is one which invites
economic instability at home.

As for the statement calling
Rev. Jesse Jackson a fool ”whose
only prerequisite-is a stagnated
sense of economic reality,” I ask,
when did The Pitt News become
an expert on political strategies?

« If they feel they have all the cor-

rect answers to solving the na-
tion’s problems, why don't they
run for the presidency?

I did not know that each
presidential candidate had to go
through close scrutiny by The Pitt
News before being considered a
',’serious" candidate.

Vaughn Clagetter‘

I was appalled and offended by
the total lackkofjournalistjic fair-
ness_ as presented in ”Perspec-
tive” on Sept. 8, *1 987  regards

  

one issue. An editorial is a state-
ment. An editorial column is a fo-
rum to explore differing sides of
an issue, not an editorial.

Another comment was that we
offended some Jackson support-
ers through our editorial. Mon-
day's paper had a none-to-
enthusiastic editorial concerning
the papal visit, which I'm sure
offended some practicing cathol-
ics, but it was majority opinion,
and just as in the case of the Jack-
son editorial, we ran it.

Another reader asked us that if
we are experts on political strate-
gy, why aren't we running for
president? My reply: If you're an
expert on editorial policy, why
don't youwrite for a newspaper?

A lack of journalistic fairness in
-perspective. Hmmm. Perspective
is a section of our paper ear-
marked especially for the ex-
change of ideas. An opinion
essentially says: ”I believe this."

Therefore, an opinion is by na- ,

ture unfair. The space alotted for
letters everyday is meant to allow
for decent from readers, thus
negating the essential unfairness"
of an opinion. How can we be
accused of unfairness if we print
the letters people send us?

”The Pitt News is a student or-
ganization established to provide

to presidential candidate Jesse
Jackson.

It's one thing to present a sar-
castic view of an issue and
another to slander the reputation
of a respected presidential candi-
date for the sake of ”having fun.”
The Pitt News is a student organi-
zation established to provide a fo-
rum for students to voice their
opinions — not to play judge in
a political arena. Let's stick to the
issues at hand.

Mina Tarpeh

Recently, this paper's editorial
staff gave their view on Jesse Jack-
son's decision to run for the
presidency of the United_States.
Of course, it is their right to ex-
press theirviews, but they must
learn to exercise more caution
and write with a little more
knowledge than they tend to
demonstrate.

I may not necessarily agree
with Jesse Jackson's campaign
platform, but I must ask this
paper, is he wrong for trying to
"save” this country from certain
economic collapse? Or is he just

a fool as this paper suggested.‘

Maybe we should sit back and do
nothing while Far Eastern govern-
ments continue to build econom-
ic powerhouses. In-case the staff
of this paper is unaware, the No.
I and No; 2 banks in the world‘
are Japanese — banks millions of
dollars ahead of their American
counterparts.

The paper also suggests that

when is the next president of the

United States not an ”issue at 
hand?” For a response to the first '~ “ ~

phrase of the above quote, I refer
you to the previous paragraph.

Another reader claims that

”foo|” has some serious racial‘

slurs. Oh?

Finally, someone. said that? '8

”More blacks are needed onthe

to what may be offensive to black ' '

a year and a half and have never A - »

seen anyone turned downfor a
staff position. The reason that_
there aren't enough blacks on this
staff is that not enough have ap-
plied, pure and simple. We ac-
cept anybody who can write.

lf_it were Joe Biden in Pitts-,

burgh over Labor Day, we would
have written an editorial about
him and more than likely fea-
tured him in a cartoon. It proba-
bly wouldn’t have been very
positive either. Now, ifthat were
the case, would we be receiving

as much criticism as we are now?

good? The Japanese have enor-
mous trade restrictions against
our products, while we have few,
if any, against theirs.

’ Aside from that, our govern-
ment makes it very difficult for
our corporations to compete with
all the regulations imposed on
them. So, you see, you failed to
mention that from Jackson's plat-
form. You say he would be inter-
fering with the free enterprise
system by having a protectionist
attitude, the system has been in-
terfered with for years before him
by all the government regula-
tions. It can only be concluded»
that this staff did not do its home-
work before writing their editori-
al, or did their prejudices cloud
their minds? _

— Jesse Jackson, with his ”stagnat-
ed sense of reality,” made a great
political move by aligning‘ him-
self with organized. labor and by
doing so on Labor Day in Pitts-
burgh —- as opposed to launch-
ing his campaign from a Miami
hotel room.

THE PITT News, Wednesday, September 15, I987

 

I By Patty Pisula

For The Pitt. News

I Bought the Beatles’ The White Album on CD the other day. Some-
one I know picked it up and perused the packaging.
- "Oh,.” she said, ”these guys did ‘Dear Prudence’ too?”
Big sigh.
I thought it was a blow to popular culture when Inch High Private

  I - . Eye and The Man from Cilad began to fade from the minds of the

public. And now this. It really bothered me, and I'm not exactly sure
why.

In 1976 (way before the advent of commercial exploitation of Big
Chill music) there was a Spic & Span commercial that implied the
product cleaned your floor so well you_could actually walk on the
polished surface without any shoes! Even more impressive was the
catchy tune, "Barefootin' " that accompanied the ad. I wouldhum
that sucker for hours. _

One day I was unconsciously singing the tune around one of my
older .sister’s none-too-savory boyfriends. He was impressed.

.I was bewildered. . '

Even at age 11, I had a sneaking suspicion that soap operas (prime
time for soap ads) were not part of a biker's social agenda. There was
more to this situation than met the eye, but I wasn't going to ask him
about it.

About a year later, I was shuffling through some records at a neigh-

’ borhood garage sale. Some unfortunate kid left for college and his

mom raped his room and sold it for profit. Well, in the overflowing
box 0’ singles, I picked up the big Brownsville Station hit "Smokin’
in the Boy's Room" (yes, they did it before Motley Crue, but without
the benefit of a provocative video to give the song even more in-
sight). On the flipside was a song called ”Barefootin.’ ” Wow, could

it be? -

My mom bought me the record (knowing full well she would do"

the same thing to my room one day) and it was, in fact, the
"Barefootin.’ " I listened to it over and over without having to suffer
through Asgthe World Turns.

The point is, if I wouldn't have been so uptight about sounding
stupid, Thor (my sister's man) might’ve told me all about Browns-
ville Station and maybe even Bachman Turner Overdrive. And be-
sides, I couldn't have sounded more stupid when I very matter of
factly told my brother-in-law (who, as it turns out, is president of L0-
cal i51 — mechanics who want the national anthem to be changed
to "Born to Run”) that Manfred Mann wrote "Blinded by the Light.”

So, because you probably won ’t ask, here are some interesting mu-
sical relationships that you may have missed:

If you like  You.should try 
Depeche Mode, The
Mission ‘ Suicide. Two guys who make the

darkest, scariest music ever.
Minimalistic synthesizers and
graphic vocals. Can't dance to it
though.

Floyd. Compared to him, Hitch’s

carry the weight of the world on
his shoulders).

Benjamin Constant’s ”Peasant
Women" could be a pattern of
dress for France's northern
provinces. It features several
women dressed in traditonal
clothing with large white hats,
natural colored skirts and aprons
and long shawls.

The Dutch Anton Mauve’s
drawings show the influence of
his contemporary impressionist
peers of the 18705 and '80s. One
of the artist's country scenes is a
fleeting image of peasants in a
fuzzy and blurry manner. The
landscape alludes to a November
afternoon with its barren

. branches, dry grass and dull sky.

French artist Honore Daumier
often portrayed events of the
French V political scene while
showing human suffering and tor-
ture. "The Gossip” is a composi-
tion in pen and ink that features
two shabby figures in a look of
despair.

American artist Frederick
Childe Hassam, whom I remem-
ber for his beautiful and vibrant
portraits of New York City, has
work included in the museum's
collection. ”Hyde Park Corner
Night Study" features couples rid-
ing in carriages and others stroll-
ing in the park. ’

This collection of drawings, ex-
hibited through Oct. 25, offers an
unique and varied showing of
both European and American
drawing of the 19th century. If
you plan to go to the museum, try
to go on a weekday afternoon. It
is less crowded then, and you can
enjoy the experience in a
pleasant and peaceful en-
vironment. I

Masters on display at Frick

By Lisa Currin
For The Pitt News

The Renaissance-style interior
of the Frick Art Museum in Point
Breeze boasts the ideal setting for
its latest exhibit Old Master
Drawings from Chatsworth.

The show is a collection of
16th- to 18th-century master
drawings from the Devonshire
collection at Chatsworth. The ex-
hibition includes original works
from Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael
and Rembrant.

The Frick Art Museum is the
first stop of the drawings on their
premier tour of the United States.

This is not the first time works
of art from the ancestral home of
the Dukes of Devonshire have
been on exhibit in America;
however, this particular group of
drawings has never before been
to these shores.

selection of 124 drawings em-
braces landscape, portraiture,
caricature and copies of masters

were known for their uniqueness
of style; they did prove to be the
impetus for the creation of later

philosophies, which looked to

the work of the Renaissance ar-
tists for ‘a guiding ideology.

One such school was the Man-
nerists or maniera represented in
the show by the work of Correg—
gio and Pamigiano. These artists
drew their subject matter from
finished paintings, rather than na-
ture as had their predecessors.

Many of the drawings are
preparatory sketches for mosaics,
tapestries, ceilings and frescoes.
But the landscapes and portrai-
ture are also exquisite. .

Viewing the exhibit one leaves
not wondering as to why these ar-
tists have been revered through-
out history as ”masters.”

It is a show not to be missed.
It remains on display through
November 8 at the Frick Art
Museum.

Mclean
plays old

favorites

By Kim Congello

For The Pitt News

There is no doubt that music
has taken many steps forward in
the past decade, but forward does
not necessarily mean improved.
When listening to music of late,
is it too often that you find your-
self struggling to understand the
words or for that matter the
voice? And when you are able to
hear the words; are they are
worth listening to?

If this is all too true for you,
perhaps you were
refreshed this past weekend at
Neighbor Fair at Station Square.

Last Saturday, Don McLean
performed in Pittsburgh after
nearly 10 years. A good sized
crowd came to enjoy this man's
refined talents.

The outdoor stage was set up
so that no matter where you
were, you were relatively close to
McLean. Many people were
aware of this closeness.

He stood on the stage, (acous-
tic guitar in hand, backed by a
bass) and captivated the audience
in a wholesome, seldom-seen
way. His words and the sincerity
in his voice seemed to be ab-
sorbed by the audience, and an
air of calmness and relaxation
was prominent.

Within his 90-minute perfor-
mance, he sang such classics as:
”Crying," ”And I Love You So,”
Hank Williams’ hit ”A Feeling
Called~the Blues,” Terry Sharp's
”You ‘Can't Blame the Wreck on
the Train” and Buddy Holly's
”Everyday.”

People waited in anticipation
to hear ”American Pie,” and they

’ heard it. During this song,

McLean's guitar string broke, but
that only made this eight minute
wonder-song, dedicated to Bud-
dy Holly, into a nine minute
wonder-song.

McLean sang a two song en-
core with v”This Little Light of
Mine,” and ”Vincent.” This song
is‘ his tribute to Vincent Van
Gogh, 18th-century artist extraor-
dinaire. A copy of this song is in
the time capsule of the Van Gogh
Museum in Amsterdam.

Wednesday, September 16, T9877

AP Sports Writer

WASHINGTON —- The NFL
Players Association, which last
week rejected the club own-
ers’ proposal as ”garbage,” on

ment with its ideas on what
‘the contract should look like.
i The union said its proposal
”addresses all of the crucial
points needed to reach a set-
tlement.” -

Details of the document,
presented a week before the
union's Sept. 22 strike dead-
line, were expected to be
made available later Tuesday.

Tuesday presented manage-’

”We have adapted our con-
tract to some of their
thoughts,” NFLPA spokesman
Frank Woschitz said, referring
to management's proposal.
”There are considerable
changes from our original con-
tract proposal.”

Both sides submitted pro— A

posed contracts to each other
in late April when the talks for-
mally got underway.
Woschitz said the counter-
proposal was almost com-
pletely prepared’ early
Monday. He said the union
decided to delay presenting it
to management so it could in-
corporate some of the findings

derived from Monday's meet-
ing between pension techni-
cians from both sides.

”We wanted to wait to
check the numbers,”
Woschitz said. ”We_ spent
much of [Tuesday] morning
going over those numbers and
the rest of the contract to be
sure everything was just
right.”

Management officials had
expressed surprise that NFLPA
Executive_Director Gene Up-
shaw had spent the latter part
/of Monday in Redwood City,
Calif., the training facility of
the San Francisco 49ers, when
he union was to spend the

night working on its counter-
proposal. _

”That means either Gene
has no input on their counter-
proposal or they've been sit-
ting on the thing,” said
Management Council spokes-
man,John Jones.

Upshaw spoke to the 49ers
for two hours to inform the

players about the talks.’

Woschitz said Upshaw had al-
ready provided his input
toward the counterproposal
and returned in plenty of time
Tuesday morning to go over
the final draft.

”He had planned that meet?

ing with the 49ers awhile

back,’-’ Woschitz said. ”Every- W
thing was‘ all set before he left '
except for the penison clauses, '
and there was nothing he
could do until we got’ the
results of that meeting.”

Last weekend the. sides met

Players’ Association draws its own rules

Christy making
the most out of

By Sam Tallarico
Assistant Sports Editor

Freshman linebacker Jeff
Christy hasn't played football for
very long. Fact is, he's only been
playing since the seventh grade.
But ‘it's not because he didn't

-want to.

”My mother and father
wouldn't allow ‘me to play. My
brother played midgetfootball,
and that's how he got knee
problems.”

For head coach Mike Gottfried,
that may have been a blessing in
disguise. ‘

”He is really exceptional. He's
living up to the challenge,” said
Gottfried. ”He’s living up to our

- expectations.”

Christy,‘ a graduate of Freeport
High School and brother of form-
er Panther Greg Christy (1980-81,
83-84), definitely left his mark set-
ting nine school records. He
showed his versatility by playing
four different positions: lineback-
er, fullback, punter and
placekicker. .

This type of versatility shows

_what a strong athlete he was. It

didn't go unnoticed.

Street and Smith’s declared
him one of the Top 50 prospects
in the country. Bally Top 100,
and Emfinger’s Top 100 placed
him on their lists.

He was a Collegiate Sports of
America All—America. He was
chosen for the Big 33 All—Star
team, first team AP All-State, Pitts-
burgh Press Finest 44 and Pitts-
burgh Post—CazetteFabulous 22,
the latter two for two years.

Wait, there's more.

He was named first team All-
America by Athlon, Super Prep
and National Prep, all occurring
in his junior year. He was select-
ed as a 1985 United States Army
Reserve Junior All-Star and was
All—Conference three straight sea-
sons (1984-86).

Christy rushed for over 2,800 V
yards with 45 career touchdowns

 

‘Miami

lucky situation

and led the WPIAL in scoring
with 192 points last season. He
finished his high school career
with 337 points (45 touchdowns,
45 extra_ points and nine field
goals). ' ~

When it came time to move on
to college, Christy was a hot com-
modity. USC, UCL‘A,‘Nebraska,-
Oklahoma and the Universitysof

6—foot—3, 225—pound linebacker,
but to no avail.

’’I came here because I would
have a chance to get some play-
ing time. [Former Panther line-
backer] Steve Apke was leaving
so I would have a chance,”
Christy said. ”And it was close to
home.” ~

Well, right now he is getting
that chance, mostly in part to the
injury sustained by junior line-
backer Jerry Olsavsky. When Ol-
savsky had arthroscopic surgery
on his knee, senior linebackerJer—
ry Wall moved to Olsavsky’s line-
backerjspot, thus allowing Christy
a chance to start in only his se-
cond collegiate game.

/ In the Pitt-Brigham Young sea-
son opener, Christy saw some
playing time and recorded four
tackles. He got his first start in the
Panther home opener against

‘ North Carolina State. His six tack-

les gavehim 10 on the season,
good enough for a sixth—place tie
on the team. ' '

But what happens when‘ Ol-
savsky'returns?» Chances are he
will get his position back, and
Wall ‘will move back to his spot.
Where does that leave Christy?

’’I don't know. It depends on
how his knee is. If it’s'1OO per-
cent, he'll play his position,”
Christy said. ”l’ll go inwhen and
if he needs a rest or if something

, happens.”

Gottfried and Christy appear to
be on thelsame wavelength.

”Je'rry will come back, and Jeff
ca_n play in_»a couple of spots». He

    last.
 5Miké'  Gottfried  ‘announced -' his

recruits?

-1 Remember how happy
sportswriters and critics were
with-_ the choices he had made?
Wenow know why.

"A class like this gives you

hope for the future again," said
. Gottfried yesterday. From the ap-

pearance of the Class of '87 dur-
V ing. the past two games, this
‘statement's validity is thrustinto
the forefront.

After all, the statistics speak for
themselves — and especially on
the defense.

A Jeff Christy, who has played in
both games and started in last
week's battle against North Caro-
lina State, has 10 tackles and one
hurry. Louis Riddick has eight
tackles, a hurry and a deflected
pass. Craig Gob has three tackles,
_and Dave Dixon has one.

And Marc Spindler, the former
USA Today Defensive Player of

 the Year and who is only 17 years j

old, has 11 tackles, one hurry,
. one. sack and received a fumble
in last week's game. '
Now, just to put things into per-
spective, these guys aren't the
well-weathered, battle-worn and

. those-who—fought-the-good-fight

veterans.
These guys are freshmen.

The . difference between the
men and’ the boys has certainly
changed from being just the price
of their toys. We're talking num-
bers of letters earned in college
careers nowadays.

I wonder what the reason for

this is. I'm certainly not one to

look a gift horse in the mouth or
dismiss a run-of—the-mill. modern-
day miracle, but the situation the
Panthers are in is certainly rare.
Actually, in analysis, abnormally
rare.

They've already got opposing
coaches commenting about them
— commenting about them in a
fearful way.

"|’ve known Pitt's defense and
I've heard that the freshmen he's
[Mike Gottfried] using are big —
real big,” was the statement Tem-
ple coach Bruce Arians made.

Just about every one of them
you talk to at first gives the nor-
mal routine stock answers such as
''I’m proud to be a Pitt Panther,”
or "lt’s great coaching.-” But these

‘are so esoteric."There has to be

something different.
Something deeper.

I got my answer first from Eric
Seaman, the startingﬁfreshman
tight end.

"We’ve really been accepted
well by the team,” he said.

Mike Gottfried has always

professing has paid off.

''I didn't think it would be as

lost.

I'm not saying that the Golden
Girls are suddenly going to turn

I » into ladies fair, or that Pitt Stadi-

um will, on foggy nights, sprout
high towers and glow like a
Camelot, but there is one thing
going on which is enlightening-
ly medieval. At this point, the
magic seems to be back.

But the strangest part is,
whatever the magic is that Gott-
fried turned on, it seems not only‘
to be working for the freshmen,
but for the entire team; And this,
at least in this analyst's eyes, is
most certainly a welcome im-
provement.

It is a team" so far this year
rather than a group of select pri-
ma donas strung together solely‘
by one common coach. Even cer-

 ..oriust one brief, sh i n mg moment, please

tain team members canisee this.‘

"With- the peoplewho camel -

back this year and. the new class
that came in, we have what
we've been wanting for a long
time — we have a team that real-
ly wants to win," said center Bill
Cherpak after the game last
weekend, ”and the freshmen
brought something. with them
that only helped the situation out
more.

"l’ll say one thing,” he con-
tinued, ”they sure don't play like
freshmen.”

They surely don't, but let's
keep it that way.

Bravo so far to Mike Gottfried.
He seems not only to have ful-
filled his own dream, but that of
a few thousand fans as well.

Lady Panthers
make dogfood out
of Lady Bulldogs

By Kelley Butt
Staff Writer

Although the University of
Pittsburgh's women's volleyball
team has been nationally success-
ful, the Lady Panthers have re-
mained on the fringes of a
national ranking.

Monday night, the defending
Big East champions soundly
thumped defending South East
Conference champions, the Ge-
orgia Bulldogs in Fitzgerald Field
House. Pitt defeated Georgia
three matches to one (15-5, 7-15,
15-5 and 15-10).

The Lady Panthers hope there
will be no more ”waiting on the

_ fringes”with this win.

With this stunning upset, Pitt
boasts an unblemished 7-0 slate
for the year. This year, the Lady

Panthers have the power to back ,

up the claim ”Pitt is it.”
According to Coach Shelton

Collier, ”The team wanted to

prove the high caliber volleyball

that we are capable of playing.’
We really wanted to make a‘

name for ourselves. We were for-
tunate to be able to add a nation-
al power like Georgia to our
schedule.”

After defeating nationally
ranked Georgia, the schedule
doesn't get any easier. The Lady
Panthers realize that the win over
the Bulldogs was, ”One step up

TI advanced scientifics have

the ladder,” noted Collier.
”We’re on track for this season.
Being undefeated after playing
Georgia really shows the team's
determination to win,” he said.
Just as Georgia is not a team to
be taken lightly, neither is Pitt;
not in terms of goals and certain-
ly not in terms of performance.
.The Lady Panthers center their
team around three returning First
Team All Big East squad mem-
bers: Denise Frawley, Nora Mul-
vihill and Lisa Stewart.
Mulvihill led Pitt with 18 kills
against the Bulldogs. Frawley and

Stewart both chipped in with 15 .

kills each. V
_”These statistics show that the
team was ready to assert them-

selves and play at the level -that -
-..,the game dictated,” said Collier.

 ..However, a volleyball team

-=1l-that lives by the kill could also die - 

by the kill. The Lady Panthers’

- squad is fortunately a much more - _

versatile team. Louise O’S‘haugh-
nessey had 36 assists for_‘Pitt
against Georgia. ’

lier hopes to accomplish the

why the Lady Panthers are off to
a such a good start this season. A
full, healthy roster is a big plus for
the team. The fact that Pitt lost
only one player from last year's

For the N FL, strange days are these indeed:

By Thomas Danyluk

Staff Writer

Could someone please explain
the reason for this strange be-
havior? — ”Skin Trade" by Du-
ran Duran

Put it this way — by the way
the season opened, nothing
seems sacred, and no tyrant
seems safe in the NFL anymore
these days. Theldefending Super
Bowl champion Giants get
smeared on Monday night. The
lowly, or should it be once low-
ly, Tampa Bay Buccaneers open
1987 by scoring 48 points
without Vinnie Testaverde and
whipping Atlanta. The New

Orleans Saints stomped all over,

last season's AFC runner-up, the
Browns. Houston, yes, Houston,
came from way behind and beat
a solid Rams, yes, the Rams.

Now what is going on here?
Something cosmic, it seems. Are

g the stars lined up in the curious

shape of Vinnie T's nose? Is it the
league-ordered changing of Brian
"12 milion? Seattle isn't that bad
a place after all” Bosworth’s
number from 44 to (gasp) 55? Is
the sun shining in Cleveland? Has
Don Johnson started shopping at
K-Mart? _
Alas, we may never know. But
if the second + and possibly, last
— week of NFL action is anything

like the first, it might be a good .

idea to start rubberizing the in-
side walls of your TV room.

Here's what's in store for Sun-
day's games:

Denver 27 Green Bay 9 — The
Broncos blew away Seattle by 23
in what was expected to be the
AFC game of the season. Green
Bay is having some serious trou-
bles, and coach Forrest Gregg has
1 3/: feet out the door. Hopefully,
for his sake, he has big feet:

Buffalo 19 Houston 10 —— The
Bills came awfully close to beat-
ing the Jets last Sunday and prob-
ably should have. What

Houston's 1' rapidly improving’ _

defense did to the LA Rams was
no fluke, but then again, neither

is Buffalo quarterback Jim Kelly. -

The Bills can be stingy at Rich
Stadium.

Miami 30 Indianapolis 16 —
Miami lost a heartbreaker to New
England in a torrential downpour.
In the climate—controlled Hoosier-
dome, Dan Marino should feast
on the Colts’ pass defense. Score
could be worse than the above
mentioned. -

Philadelphia 26 New Orleans
16 — Philly gave the Redskins all
they could handle last week at
RFK. The Eagle defense is going
to be a bit more than the Saints’
young QB, Bobby Hebert, can
handle. Until they meet again.

Cleveland 36 Pittsburgh 13 --
It was the Steeler defense which
helped them get past the 49ers
last week. Heaven knows Pitts-
burgh quarterback Mark Malone
(9 of 33, 89 yards) wasn't the rea-

son. Schottenheimer’s Browns '

will be fuming after a tough
28-21 loss to the gritty Saints. -

Cincinnati 31 San Francisco 24
—— Bill Walsh's 49ers looked slop-
py and dull last Sunday. The pass-
ing game wasn't well timed. The
running game was stuffed. The
Steelers ran all over them in pil-
ing up 30 points, and Cincy’s
offense is three times more explo-
sive than Pittsburgh’s. The Ben-
gals, and their fans, are justifiably
expecting big things from the
team in ’87.

Near Upset Special of the
Week: Chicago 23 Tampa Bay
-20 — What the Bears did to the
Giants was really scary, but I'm
not sure that Ditka's crew takes
the Bucs very seriously — they

haven't in the past. Tampa quar- _

terback Steve DeBerg shredded

the Atlanta secondary for 333 

yards and five touchdowns. He
won't do that Sunday, but he'll
keep the Buccaneers close.

Washington 40 Atlanta 17 —

Even without starting QB Jay" V
Shroeder and RB George Rogers, 1

ta 24 — The Rams were shocked _‘ 5,;
out of the Astrodome by. a ‘I 5_"j‘
17-point Oiler barrage in the fi- "ill
nal 7:28 of regulation -— prior to . :'.{
that, the game was theirs. Now_ ‘ '
back at home in laid-back An’a- _
heim, LA will give a better show- . 
ing. Minnesota will give them. a
run, but without starting quarter- ~' '
back Tommy Kramer, who is out
with a pinched nerve in his neck,

the Vikes aren’t the same football ‘
team. A

(34-19) to Minnesota in which
they led by six at the half, then
got bombarded with three touch-
downs in the third quarter and
lost by 15. But so what. Detroit
quarterback Chuck Long is_due
for a big game. The Lions have
decent running backs. And the
Raider quarterbacks aren't going
to go out and shred anybody’s
secondary, including Detroit's.
LA shut out Green Bay last week,
but that's not saying much. It
should be close-

Seattle 24 Kansas City 3 — Bri-
an Bosworth’s opening day per-
formance was anything but
impressive, and the same can be
said for the whole Seattle team.
Okay, so maybe Chuck Knox’s
club wilted under all the presea-
son hype it was receiving. But
now the first one is out of the way
and the defense-minded ’Hawks
can get down to business. Four- ’
teen of the 20 points that Kansas
City scored on San Diego came
on big plays, not distinguished
downfield drives.‘ In the King-
dome? This week, look for the
Seahawks to make the big moves. -

HOMECOMING COMMITTEE

the ’Skins have enough offensive
firepower to rip up any NFL
defense. Backup quarterback
Doug Williams did a fabulous job
against the Eagles, throwing for
272 yards and two touchdowns.
The Atlanta defense? Well, every-
one knows what kind of fun the
Buccaneers had with it. Note:
The Redskins signed journeyman
quarterback Babe Laufenberg off
the waiver wire to back up
Williams.

New York Giants 23 Dallas 10
— Bill Parcell’s club will be fired
up after being humiliated Mon-
day night in Chicago. Aside from
allowing a few big plays, the Gi-
ants’ defense was pretty tough,
although cornerback Elvis Patter-
son lived up in a big way to his
burnt nickname of ”Toast.” The
Cowboys, 24-13 losers to St.
Louis, were beaten by three
touchdowns in the last two
minutes. Now what kind of
defensive performance is that?
The moral of the story? May the
best ”D” win.

STATE COLLEGE, Pa. — His
team lost _soundly and his quar-
terback was knocked silly, but
Penn State coach Joe Paterno said
Tuesday his players might be bet-
ter off as a result. .

Paterno said the Nittany Lions
might _have gained character
while they lost their 13—game

"I was pleased with our foot-
ball team in a lot of ways," Pater-
no said at his weekly news
conference. "They hung in there
right to the end.”

-Alabama jumped to a 17-0 lead
in the second quarter en route to
a 24-13 victory Saturday against

Penn State quarterback Matt

Knizner was knocked for a loop
on a sack midway through the se-
cond quarter and apparently
could not remember the location

‘of the huddle.

Second-string quarterback Tom
Bill came into the game to
replace the woozy Knizner and
led a 76-yard scoring drive to cut
the Crimson Tide’s lead to 17-7
late in the first half.

Knizner returned in the second
half but managed to move Penn
State into Alabama territory only

once in the first five times that the
Nittany Lions had the ball.

Midway through the fourth
quarter, Kniznerconnected with
Ray Roundtree for a 60-yard pass
for the final touchdown of the
game.

Paterno said he was confident
Knizner would develop as the

A season progressed and added he

had not even considered replac-
ing him with Bill.

"His best will be plenty good
enough,” Paterno said. "It’s

Paterno says loss builds players’ character

‘By David S. Martin

Associated Press Writer

when you wake up, you're down
17-O.”

Defensively, Paterno said inju-
ries to the linebacking corps con-
tinued to hamper performance.

Senior Pete Giftopoulos, who is
returning from a broken leg, was
not 100 percent healthy, and
senior Keith Karpinski didn't play
because of a sprained ankle. He
was expected to practice
Tuesday. ,

'“It was a kind of a game that
we're not used to playing,” Pater-
no said. "We’re not used to our
defense being dominated. We
give the guy the ball in their own
territory and we'll win 14-10, but

they won on the big’ run andlthe

halfback pass."

. "It's been one of those years so.
far, but it'll settle down," Pater-
no promised. "I don't think we're
in bad shape. I think we're a good
team.”

Paterno said he was uncon-
cerned by Penn’ State's drop in
The Associated Press poll from

1 1th to No. 20 following the loss :

to Alabama." -
"That's a poll for the fans," he

Continued from page 17
Gottfried said.

When asked about linebacker
depth, Gottfried said, "We don't
have it. That's why Christy's per-
formance was good."

With Christy seeing more play-
ing time now than he thought
he'd have, his goals have change
somewhat. "I wanted to get a
chance to play with Jerry Wall. I
just want to try to get as much
playing time as I can. '

But for now, he's No. 1 on the ‘

depth chart for middle lineback-
er, and if that's not enough for
one man to bear, he's second on
the depth _chart in punting to
sophomore John Rasp.

”I punt in practice, but I won't

- kick in the game unless John gets

hurt. That's pretty definite," said
Christy, who averaged 38.7 yards
a punt in his senior season at

Freeport last year. _
As for the future, Christy, who .

wants to major in sports medi-
cine/physical therapy, doesn't
know what it will hold for him.
All he would like is to get situat-
ed,Vand then he may feel a little
more comfortable.’

"I would like to be able to find
a starting position," Christy said.”
