The Great Escape

Students Elect
Spring Study

by RON LOZOWSKI

While most students have exchanged books and pencils for tennis
racquets or business suits. many Pitt students have declined the switch.

This years combined attendance at spring term and spring session
represents a substantial‘ increase over 1970. according to figures ob-
tained at the Registrars Office. As of June 1. over 15.000 students had
been invoiced. as compared to fewer than 14.000 at a similar time last
Vear.

What are the unimaginable forces persuading students to attend‘?
Could it be masochism‘? Are they gluttons for punishment‘? Why else

would a student choose to haunt the hallowed halls of the Cathedral.

while his fellows romp in the sun or try to earn needed cash?

In the case of students in the School of Nursing, the reason is sim-
ple: these students are required to attend the third term. “That’s the
way the schedule is set up; it’s structured that way,” said senior nurs-
ing student Connie Erickson.

Erickson went on to admit her small town offered "nothing for me
at home."

According to the latest available figures. over 900 students cur-
rently reside in University housing. Many more live in apartments.

One student remarked that she felt the need to remain with her
friends. It seems, then, that not only is the lure of campus life a
factor, but also the desire to enjoy the company of one’s comrades.

However. there are exceptions. Senior Robert Sapienza said he
felt that “the atmosphere is a little more informal: also. it helps to
spread credits to pull up your average.“

. While many students replied that they are attending in order to
graduate earlier. senior John Parker expressed his reason bluntly: “I
need three more credits to graduate. "

For most students, reasons are a bit less demanding. Kathleen
Rhoades, a sophomore, commented that she is attending “because I
thought that it was too early to get out of school—and I didn’t have
anything else to do.”

One student admitted that he gets “psyched up watching the
sprinklers on the Cathedral lawn.“

The atmosphere is one of escape. whether from home sweet home.
or long tenure at the University. as conscientious 4?) students pur-
sue their studies.

Judicial Rules Debated  

by CAROLECOVAL

Edward Hammond. an independent
counselor on campus judicial systems. vis-
ited the University last week to make rec-
ommendations to the Committee on Stu-
dents Rights and Responsibilities (CSRR).

CSRR. a branch of the Student Affairs
Advisory Board. was organized to review
Universityjudicial systems.

Earlier this year. the CSRR began its
efforts by compiling all the existing rules
and regulations. both academic and social.
into an official student handbook to be used
as a first draft effort toward reform.

The CSRR sent copies of this “first
draft” to freshmen; it was also given to
Resident Assistants for review and ‘com-
ment.

Hammond held open forum Wednesday
afternoon to get an idea of "students" opin-
ions of a new system for judicial process
and appeals."

Students and faculty attending this
meeting voiced concern over the ambiguity
contained in the rules in the handbook.

“It caused a lot of flak, and we expected
it,” Vice Chancellor Bernard Kobosky
said, concerning response to the hand-
book. “We asked for comment and criti-
cism.”

"We need a viable code." Kobosky
said. "and a judicial system which is clear.
consistent and equitable.“

At present, the University Review
Board, composed of students, faculty and
administrators is available but unused.

Some students said that they felt this
information was unavailable. Most stu-
dents were unsure which rules were en-
forced. or where to appeal a disciplinary
decision is one were made.

 

 

KOBOSKY: Clear, consisten, equitable system.

During the forum. various students
raisedthe question of feasible enforce-
ment under the present laws.

Hammond recommended that CSRR re-
vise the handbook code to coincide with
city, state and federal laws and also deal
with problems particular to campus life.

Hammond met with members of the
CSRR to outline a rough draft on a cam-
pus judicial system Thursday. The plan
would provide for six smaller court-like
boards to handle cases dealing with hous-
ing. organizations. academic matters, se-
curity; two would handle University com-
munity offenses.

The first three bodies. according to
Hammond‘s plan. could submit appeals
to a Systems Manager for a reversal or
upholding of a verdict; the latter three
boards could appeal to an Individual Re-
view Officer. All six types of cases could
be brought before the University Review
Board. or even the Board of Trustees.

Hammond promised to submit a formal
recommendation to the CSRR shortly
after returning to his post as assistant to
the chancellor of student affairs at South-
ern Illinois University. '

BOSTON (May 26) — Jim pass-
ed the pipe. and I took a deep

 ‘ drag.The water lapped gently at

 your feet. while we gazed across

 , -the Charles River at Cambridges
' skyline.

With the imagination of a priest
beholding a Eucharist, I retraced

, L ‘the’ last 24 hours.

.i, , The night before, we had re-
s turned late to the Beacon St.
_,  apartment. Witless after beer and
 fwine, I left my glasses on the floor
 ._ beside my bed.

‘ .Rummaging with bleary eyes for
a bathrobe the next morning, Carl
trampled on my
-«glasses and left them gnarled and
contorted.

With" all the adeptness of a

I ‘quack optometrist. I restored the

‘glasses to normalcy . . . at least

.. “'the”y appeared normal.

But I was wrong. Putting them

 on, I was suddenly transported to

anew world, which sloped up-

  ward nearly 30 degrees!

I somehow made it to Har-

 vard‘s Social Science complex.

A A good Samaritan on the second

sion and suggested that I call him
from a phone downstairs. Clutch-

_‘ I vaguely discerned an office and

“No. he won‘t be in today."

Echoes again.

“Okay. wise guy.“

I looked up. My vision was
blurred, but I was at least able to
discern a frown. Then it suddenly
dawned on me that the secretary
in the room and the secretary
on the phone were one and the same.

Grinning sheepishly and flush-
ing crimson. I made a graceless
exit.

“Go on. then-"

Out of range. I asked Jim why
he hadn‘t dropped in a quarter.

“It‘s a matter of principle." he
explained. "It‘s highway robbery
to charge you a quarter to cross
a bridge."

Satisfied by the obvious logic
of his viewpoint, I demurred. In
fact, I started to sense a feeling
of pride. I was in the company of
a Thoreau!

Dozens of people were already

Carl. - '

“Where are we going to eat?”
Iasked. .

"Durgin Park.“

“Is it a goodplace?"

"No. it‘s exceptionally bad. The
service is abominable."

I felt like Yossarian. “Wait a
second. We’re going there be-

“Yeah. That‘s right."

Too stuned to argue. I sat quiet-
ly in the car. ruing the term I took
logic at Pitt. It just made you per-
plexed by reality.

cross a bridge. We approached a

were seated unceremoniously by
a gruff waitress. who seemed
slightly more kindly than the rest.

Carl and Jim ordered $4.50

steaks.

Wealthy from Pitt News com-
pensation. I splurged and ordered
a $2.25 lambcliop.

- “What the Ilell is this?” the
waitress sneered. “You some
kind of a clieapskate?”

Flabbergasted. I could mere-
ly mutter. “Could you make it
well-done. please?"

"Well done! You'll be lucky if
you get it at all.

Sure enough, it was not well
done. “Count your blessings,” she
snarled, handing me a medium
rare lambchop.

“Could we please have some
water?" Jim asked.

“Certainly-"

That surprised me . . . until the
waitress brought a pitcher not to

our table but to the one next.
"Serve yourself.“ she barked.

“Tea!” she screamed. “Tea is

Jim had coffee. we all had
strawberry shortcake. and she
gave us our check.

Too afraid not to tip the wait-
ress. I left 40 cents. and placed
itin with Jim's and Carls.

“Where the hell‘s your tip?"
the waitress glowered. seconds
later.

"It‘s in there.“ I reddened.

“Can you beat that?” she re-
marked to the people at the next
table. “This guys runs my ass off

ped some change into my straw-
berry shortcake and retrieved it
with little finesse and no apology.

"Where are we going now?“ I
stammered as we left the restau-
rant.

“How about the dog races?“
Jim suggested.

It was the inevitable conclu-
sion to such a day. so I agreed.

We left for Wonderland, scene
of the races, and came to another
toll bridge. To my amazement,
Jim dropped in a quarter. “What’d
you do that for?” I asked. “Oh, I
believe in paying tolls for bridges
I like,” he explained.

Hours later. we sat by the
Charles\River—Jim and Carl la-
menting the fact that they had
squandered so much at the races.
Meanwhile, I lamented the fact that
I had taken Logic at Pitt.

It was "pure luck" that en-
abled Panther catcher Guy Ca-
parelli to club only one home run
during the '71 campaign. but it
was more than luck that kept him
behind the plate in most of the
games this season.

Caparelli. who was selected
to play in the College All-Star
game held at Three Rivers Sta-
dium. caught in almost every one

- of the 26 games played by the

Panthers.
“I want to catch as much as

 possible." related Caparelli. "It

gets to you a little bit though. if
you have six games in a week. So.
it‘s necessary to have a good
back-up catcher and Bill Schmid-

tke did a really good job for us
when he was in."

The Panther catcher found it
helpful to be able to participate
in the College All-Star game.

“I was happy about my selec-
tion.“ said Caparelli. "I wanted to
play in Three Rivers. It was a
good chance to see how the pros
play and it was good experience to
play with other good ball players
in the area."

Caparelli pounded out a season
average of .345 while collecting
only one home run. This lone.
"lucky” round tripper was pro-
duced in a game against De-
troit. after he had dislocated a
finger in his right hand.

“Dislocating my finger cut
down on my swing—I couldn’t
swing as hard,” he explained. “It
just so happened I hit the ball and
it took off. Things like that gen-
erally happen when you least ex-
pect it.

"At the time I thought I would
drop the bat because of my fin-
ger. I guess I was just luck—with
a good hand I didn’t hit one all
year. but with a bad hand I hit
one."

Like most college athletes.
Caparelli has aspirations for
a career in professional sports.

pros,” he said. “I didn’t think
about it until high school and
now that I’m in college I would
like to play baseball profession-
ally.

If he doesn't make it to the
ranks of the professional ball-
player. Caparelli. a sophomore
history major. would like to go on
to law school or teach history.

Looking back on the season Ca-
parelli commented. "Overall we
did all right. We got good hitting
and pitching. but we had just a
couple of bad breaks.

“Everything was going well un-
til we went to Penn State. We
would have liked to have won two
-—even if we had split we would
have gotten a bid to the NCAA.
They would have had to decide be-
tween us and Penn State and, with
our record, I think we would have
gotten it,” related Caparelli.

The '71 season is over for the
Panthers but Caparelli is not
finished playing baseball.

This summer he will be playing
for the Beechview City County
League and. with his all-star abil-
ity behind the plate and “just a
little bit of luck." he may be
playing baseball for many years
to come.

Luck Takes First In
Coaches’ Nightmare

by VINCE Di NARDO

Now that this years outdoor IC4A‘s are over. Villanova's one point. ,,
victory can be looked at as a lucky one. A number of different ifs could’
have changed the whole meet in favor of either Maryland. Penn State.

Adelphi. and Pitt.

For instance. if Mike Schurko of Pitt would have had his usual
fine steeplechase run and finished ahead of Davey Wright of Villa-
nova. who finished third. Pitt would have received the points for plac-
ing in the steeplechase. Those points would have brought them clos-
er to the winning. Also. Maryland would have beaten Villanova.

If Maryland would have had
any track power. they would have
had a runaway victory. Most of
Marylands points were scored in
_the field events.

If freshmen weren’t permitted
to compete (for the first time in
27 years) Bill Rea, Davey Wright,
and Les Nagy couldn’t have scor-
ed. This would have eliminated
Pitt from serious competition

and would have lost the meet for '

Villanova, again. Anyone of the
three remaining schools could
have walked away the winner.

Had Adelphi University of New
York had any strength in the field
events they could have certainly
romped. Most of their points were
scored in the track events.

Had the Pitt mile relay team
done as well in the finals as they

Because we're a groovy cleaner. We
know how to polish the mirrors on a
pailleted vest. We know how to clean
around the nailheads on a nailheaded
jumpsuit. We know how to keep a si-Iver
coat silver. a suede skirt suede-y. a
mini-dress in mini-shape. If you're a
groovy thing (or belong to someone
that is). do the dry cleaning thing
with us. It's a beautiful experience.

It's 89 ways better than a Volkswagen.

The car you see before you has almost twice
as much trunk space as the Volkswagen Beetle.

It gives you a smoother ride and a shorter turn-
ing radius than the Beetle.

It even has a longer lasting, more powerful en-
gine than the Beetle.

All told, this car has 89 things you've never
seen inside the Beetle.

In fact, it's so superior to the Beetle, we couldn't
call it the Beetle anymore.

So we gave this car, whose mild-mannered ex-
terior masks its true identity, a new name.

We call it SUPER BEETLE.
