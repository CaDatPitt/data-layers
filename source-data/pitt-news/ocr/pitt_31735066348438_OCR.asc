FAS Council met "last week to
review the Alternative Curriculum
(AC) program and" determine its.
status as a CAS freshmen studies

"’ «'3 offering. .

The Alternative Curriculum is an
“open classroom” approach to
EDUCATION. This option is only
available -during the freshman
year. Instead of traditional classes,"
the students are responsible for
shaping their own educational
process.

“I haven’t seen this many stu-
dents at a meeting since 1969,”
said Council head CAS dean
Robert Marshall. Nearly 25 AC
participants jammed the meeting to
answer council members’ ques-
tions.

_ . \ Marshall stressed this was not a
if-§‘\'~decision making meeting. “This is

only the start of an evaluation
process. Since the program is only
in its second of the allotted four
years, it may be too early to make

any deﬁnite conclusions about the

program.” ' _. -'  '~- -

_Economics professor David_
Bramhall said, “It is useless ‘to
compare the quality and content of

a»? .:‘this year’s program to last.” For

one thing, these are different.
‘students, the size is much smaller.
But .the diversity of interests is not.
Physics Professor John Townsend
who participated in the AC pro-
gram last term spoke on “learning
theories”. “The AC program
makes learning ﬂexible - to the
needs of the students. They are
given enormous freedom to make

/'  ' gwtghoices. ’ ’

Associate English Professor Phil
Wion, another AC faculty partici-
pant, said, “The students can work
independently. "in seminars,
through offerings, workshops,
general meetings, core’ groups.
But they are in constant interaction
with other people in their learning

processess. They are forced to
create and modify their own,
world.”

Undergraduate assistant Cindy
Kramer stressed the importance of
the open classroom situation to
respond to the diverse intersts, of

As a Pitt student, Rebecca re-
ceived $500 each term from the
Pennsylvania Higher Education
Assistance Agency -(PHEAA),
enough to cover: her entire tuition
costs.

In the last term of her senior year,
Rebecca got a notice from PHEAA
advising her to make sure the
University had received all tuition
payments from the state, in order

. to clear her record and enable her

‘to graduate.

She went to the Ofﬁce of Student
Accounts and was promptly as-
sured that her account there was
clear; everything had been paid up
in full and she could graduate at
the end of the winter term.

  

students.

Political Science council member
Professor Richard Cottam referred‘
to the program as “an experiment
in learnir_g.”_ He suggested a
study be made of results pertaining
to the regular CAS course offerings
from which changes and criticisms
of the program could be made.

“This is also seen as an experi-
ment by AC participants." Wion
said. “At the general meeting
each Thursday we re-examine our
goals. Soul searching and modifi-

cation is always taking place.”

Student input was also voiced at
the meeting. Stephaine Flomm
sophomore and former AC student,
spoke of developing new kinds of
interests and broadening her
knowledge. “Other freshmen are
really, missing something. They
are rushing ahead with their stu-
dies and not taking the time to
examine what they are learning.”
Flomm said.

$500 million to Nam, Ford Says

BY KEN GORMLEY

Washington--President Ford re-

situation "in Indochina, and feels
the US. should give an additional

’ ‘$300 million "in" ‘aid’ to South

Vietnam and Cambodia, Press
Secretary Ron Nessen told report-

Nessen quoted the President as
saying aid to these countries was

penses. I

With only days left in the winter
term, the University notified
Rebecca she owed $1,000 toward
her ﬁnal year’s tuition, and it had

-to be paid before she would be

allowed to graduate. Frantically,
Rebecca wrote PHEAA, informing
it of the misunderstanding, asking
for help. But‘ her account was

differences with the University.

relations for our country to
continue-to act as a “reliable ally.”

According to Nessen, President

, Ford also felt American monetary

assistance was necessary in Indo-

china for the sake ‘of the many '

Americans who saw their friends
and relatives maimed or die in
Vietnam. _ I -
‘‘If in 6 months there were
disaster (in Indochina), it would be
a traumatic experience for many

US citizens,” Ford reportedly said.
And if the US would deny aid to
Vietnam and Cambodia at this
crucial point, the President con-
cluded that “The odds are in favor
of a disaster.” .

Nessen declined to clarify exactly
what the President meant by a
“disaster,” saying that the term
should be self-explanatory.

music ﬂoating through the air.

Rebecca to resolve her differences

There are, however, more than a
few. coincidences of this order on
campus. Everyday, students are
victimized by University policies
and procedures, with no recourse
to action.

If a student is accidentally billed
for a service, or a discrepancy
appears on his record, he must face
the University as an individual, and
try to wrangle a solution to his
problem from its massive bureau-
cracy. Often, he is assured of help

White House a Iielluva Beat.

(Continued from Page 1)

“Fill out these forms.” Being
that it’s five-on-two, you have no
choice. The pen slides through
your sweaty, quivering ﬁngers and
prints something vaguely resemb-
ling your name, but also vaguely
resembling any other name in the
English or Slovak language. One of
the guards gives you a mean stare.

Suddenly a familiar face presses
its nose against the window...
Walter Cronkite from CBS News.
“Yes Mr. Cronkite. Do you have
your pass with you today?” While
Walter explains he’s been to the
White House several million times,
a sinister-looking bearded man
wearing a Swiss Yoddler’s hat and
who looks like he has a false nose
connected to his glasses walks up
to the gate and waves.

“He’s okay,” the guard says to
his buddy, and the gate swings
open. After a few minutes Mr. '
Cronkite gets in, too.

Finally, the papers are all ﬁlled
out, and sporting a red and white
press pass you step conﬁdently out
of reach of the maniacal stares of

I the guards, and up the White

House driveway. Another guard
stands motionless up against the
far door of the President’s home, as
if someone had hung him to the
doorknob by the seat of his pants.

The Press Brieﬁng is held in a
cozy little room in one of the White
House wings. You'd never suspect
these men were prominent report-
ers for the Washington Post and
ABC if you saw them out on the
street. Sure, some did have suits
and beards and smoked pipes, but
many had knapsacks and army
coats, and a few came in wearing
pole shirts and carrying motorcycle
helmets.

At ﬁrst it seemed there were only
ten or so reporters, but when a sexy
voice announced the brieﬁng would
begin, they scurried out of the
woodwork and up to the front of the
room like sewer rats in a ﬂash
ﬂood. They sat on the floor, on
tables, and on each other.

Secretary, strutted into the room .

this is not the time to re-open

Ford hopes to set the Federal house
in order, through investigations by

Nessen joked around for awhile,
told newsmen the President’s
schedule for the next few days, and
then answered questions, lighting
up one Marlboro after another.
Some subjects were treated with
complete seriousness--CIA activi-
ties and aid to Vietnam, while little
witticisms were tossed into other
areas.

A few reporters were particularly
concerned about the incident
several weeks ago, when Secretary
of State Henry Kissenger’s cargo
plane was found stocked with cases
of beer. “Whey does Mr.

More importantly, I used to study hard — the midnight cram
sessions — the 7-day weeks.

But I didn’t start making good grades until I learned
some amazing secrets about studying and about myself —
secrets that I have never shared with anyone else until now.

This information could be worth more to you than all
the money in the world. What's more, I feel so confident
about that claim that I'm going to request that you send
me 10 dollars for something that will cost me less than 1
‘dollar ‘to’ produce. And I'll even make the offer sound so
astonishing that you’ll be sorry if you don’t accept it.

How can I make such a statement? Because I'm in the
business of selling educaﬁonal information for a prdfit —
just like a professional daily newspaper or a lawyer. Samuel
Johnson once said, “No man but a blockhead ever wrote
except for money.” Besides, if I didn't make a good proﬁt,
you'd assume my education was wasted and whatever I have
to offer you is therefore worthless.

Yet I can unconditionally guarantee its results! In fact, I
will make you the most unusual guarantee in the world.
And that is: I won’t even cash. your check or money order
for 20 days after I've sent you my material.

You'll have plenty of time to look it over and try it out.
If you don’t agree that it’s worth a hundred times what you
paid, simply send it back and I’ll return every penny of your
investment — even if you've marked in it. '

The material I'm going to send you will explain in detail
what tookme 12 years to perfect and put down on paper.
And it’s going to be the biggest bargain you ever bought —
How to pass school the lazy man’s way. I call it “The Lazy
Man's Way” because the wisest man I ever met once said,
“Anything is easy once it’s fully understood.” ‘

Now, I don’t mind bragging just a little to prove my
point. Because unless I do, you won’t be motivated enough

to try my guaranteed method. You see, I went from a 2.1 3

GPA (4.0=A system) to a ‘term average of over 3.5, while
taking similar courses yet more units, merely by using the
methods spelled out in my material. What’s more, I have
copies of my official transcripts to prove it!

And I'll show you exactly how I accomplished this
while at the same time holding your money in ‘escrow’ until
you’re completely satisfied that reviewing my material is the
smartest thing you ever did.

»All in all, I give you more than 150 pages ﬁlled with
proven methods on how to study, how to take exams, how
to budget your time for greater efficiency, how .to overcome
anxiety, plus numerous other ways of getting better results
with less work and more fun — real, practical ideas you can
put to work at once. , .

The concepts include: 4 steps to -goal achievement; 6

steps to better reading; key factors in memory retention;

 
 way to

     

excel  

demonstrated ways to take meaningful notes —- ‘plus proven
tips on listening, as well as passing both subjective and
objective type examinations.

If all this sounds too good to be true, I don’t blame you. _

Because there has never been a program like this before 4 a
system that shows you how to raise your G.P.A. by simply
using the natural talents you possess right now. .

It doesn't require “intelligence”. I'm considered by most
to be average.

Nor does it require “luck”. You see, I sincerely believe
that we make our own good fortune. '

And it certainly doesn't require “effort” in the sense

~ that effort is hard work. Work is only hard if we dislike the

task at hand.

Rather, it simply requires “belief”. Enough belief to put
the simple concepts into action. Enough belief to absorb‘ the
material. If you do that, I guarantee (remember, I said,
guarantee) the results will be astonishing.

You don’t_have to interfere with'your present studies.
In fact, you can review the material in less than one hour.
You don't even have to “believe” me until after you
examine it. .

Just try it. That's all I ask. If I've boasted too much,
simply return the package for a refund. All you have to lose
is a couple of seconds and a postage stamp to see if I'm
right. , I

But what if I'm telling you the truth?

After all, while there are no certain shortcuts to success,
there’s no sense in taking the long way around, either.

 Jnember-elect Craig Bluestein. They do not like the idea of paying

Zegler $2S(X) for his services, but claim this is not an attempt to stiﬂe
his right of free speech. Wendy Traub, co-chairperson of the

 Programming Committee. defends Ziegler’s appearance and fee. and

we must agree with her.

The objections to Ziegler seem to center around his activity in the

Nixon administration beseiged by the Watergate scandals. Although
we do not condone the role Ziegler played in the Watergate drama, the
issue should not be the morality or immorality but rather does this
political speaker have anything to offer Pitt students. And we think he
does.

between his former boss, who some have said ‘had an eerie dislike for

It should be interesting to hear Ron Ziegler’s view on the last . year of

The administration didn't pay any attention. It seemed there was
something so wrong with Porter that ‘all the support and the credentials
were unimportant. It's hard to believe that something so damaging

could just disappear.

During the time FAS Dean Jerome Rosenberg was being pressured to
reveal the reasons behind the choice of Roland Smith to the ‘black

“no comment.” The most concrete reason to be advanced was that
Porter had not completed a PhD. Well, Porter still hasn't completed

University settled on Porter by process of elimination. which is hardly

No Help for the

(The following column was re-
searched and written by Brian
Durm, Denise Gower, and Cal
Ritchie.)

It has been more than 20 months
since Jospeh Newman, chairman of
the Department of Special Educa-
tion and Rehibilitation in the School
of Education, completed his survey
of accessibility problems for handi-
capped students at the University,
showing, among other things, that
only three of the 38 University
buildings were equipped with ade-
quate elevator service for severely
disabled people. It has been even
longer that the handicapped have
complained about the inaccessibi-
lity of buildings, the lack of curb
“cuts," and other simple pro-
blems. Yetthe complaints are still
valid.

The ‘University has made some
improvements since the Newman

Report. Handicapped students are ‘

now housed together on the second
floor of Tower C, an area equipped
with special bathroom facilities,

I e curb cuts have been built on the

comer of Forbes Avenue and
Bigelow Boulevard, a non-revolv-
ing, card-operated door is being
installed in the Cathedral of Learn-
ing to accomodate wheelchair peo-
ple; when necessary, students are
given special keys to allow them to
stop elevators at floors on which_

they do not normally stop, and now \
"lavatory facilities for the handi-

capped are being installed in the
Cathedral. — '

We applaud these efforts. We
feel, though, that a‘ few minor
innovations and some considerate,
‘logical thinking can bring Pitt’s
treatment of the handicapped to a
more humane level. Unfortunate-
ly, Pitt is lacking in both these
areas. "

,Wheel’cha_ir students must travel
farther than others going from
building to building on campus.

This is primarily because of a lack _
of curb cuts, which are lowered '

portions of the sidewalk curbs that
enable wheelchairs to roll up and
down easily.

, To reach the Frick Fine Arts
Building, wheelchair students must
travel a dirt road. On a rainy day,
or during the winter, the building is’
inaccessible. The University for-

Rightful Position.

Dear Editor,
No...I really can’f believe it!

.Curtiss Porter’s chairmanship is

becoming a reality in this here
university (this fact disputable by
many...the university part that is).
One would never have believed
that Pitt’s tin ear would open up
and listen to its people screaming
for a moral justice, but alas they
have seemingly, now, broken down
the conceptions and done some-
thing right...a little late, sure, but
right. ‘

Praise must go to the Black Action
Society [BAS] for their diligence in
pursuing Porter’s rightful place

_ and this publication for presenting

the actions and circumstances
under which the whole mess had
taken place.

Let the‘ outside world know that
the kick hasn't left the student...if
someone kicks them in the face
they'll do their damn best to get up
and rectify it. The BAS seems to
have been put away in the corner,
but when a plea had to be sent up

1 and believable way the

goes the opportunity of graduating
any handicapped Fine Arts majors,
and because Benedum Hall is
completely surrounded by an im-
pregnable curb, any Engineerings
majors also;

The same applies to the anthro-
pology department, the physical
education department, and per-
'haps many more. The ultimate
paradox at the University is a gym
course designed especially for the
handicapped, but located in Trees
Hall, where few of them can go.

There are other problems. No
elevator service whatsoever is a-
vailable to the second floor of the
Cathedral. This means that severe-
handicapped people cannot attend
class there. The current remedy is
to relocate the entire class if a
handicapped student has enrolled,
causing a chain-reaction of room
changes and labor and frustration
for the University, the faculty, and
the students.

‘ Revolving doors, water fountains,
telephones, toilet facilities—so
many things most students take for
granted are inaccessible to the
handicapped. *

There are solutions to all these
problems. Classes on the second
ﬂoor of the Cathedral can be

as__signed"‘so that the only courses_:

  Handicapped 

on that floor are available else-
where. Phsyical Education Ther-
apy classes can be held in the YIKC
Building behind Heinz Chapel,
which is more accessible than
Trees Hall. A '

The problems posed by outlying
buildingings such as Trees, the
Anthropology Building, the Frick
Fine Arts Building, can be solved
by arranging vehicular transporta-
tion for the handicapped.

We are not adovcating a complete
revamping of the campus. Esti-
mates of that costrange upward to
$9 million. We are advocating the
institution of a policy making it

' possible for wheelchair students to

manuever about campus more eas-
ily. When city and state laws are
involved, as with the curb cuts, we
urge the University to obtain a
cessation of jurisdiction so such
renovations can be made as a
matter of course. -

We feel that wheelchair students
deserve at least this much consid-
eration. But more importantly, an
accessible campus will mean that
handicapped students will more
readily come to Pitt. There is much
talent, creativity, and intellect a-
mong the handicapped to which the
University should open itself up.

Believe it or not somebody read
the paper and somebody said,

Student Help for
Setting Priorities
Dear Editor: A

I agree with Chancellor Posvar’s
statement that the University will
have to set priorities in light of
“...what could be our gravest
ﬁnancial situation since 1965.”
Students and faculty should be
actively drumming-up support for

areas in which we feel should be
priorities.

One area which might suffer from
the priority setting would be
alternative learning situations.
These include such different
programs as Alternative Curric-
ulum and the School of External
Studies. I feel these programs
should continue to have priority as
they show a vital concern for
making quality education available
in a changing world.

Secondly, the University should _

have as a very high priority, being
a vehicle for positive social change.
A priority such as this would mean
that the University would actively
seek to do research which might
provide directives for solving some
of the world’s problems, on the
other hand, would refuse to
undertake research which would
likely be detrimental to the world,
e.g., weapon research. Another
result of this priority would be
action by the University for the
elimination of sexism and racism
within the University and com-
munity. - A

I reiterate, students and faculty’
should let the administration know
what their priorities are.

Sincerely,
John F. Powers

To the Editor,

I am sorry that I cannot join you in
weeping about the plight of

\Student “C”s on campus who

that “A” is keeping. Anybody who

attention by jailing fathers who do

to deal with the problem of those
who do.

An acquaintance of mine who
doted on his wife and children was
shocked to learn one day that his
wife had gone to Connecticut with

In his article Mr. Waseleski

What the author failed to
understand is that the new majority
is not a result of new morality, but

a result of the fear of being left
without any energy resources.

Oil speaks louder than morality.
Forttmately for the world there are
still some» small nations which are
willing to stand by what they
believe.

The claim by the author that an
overzealous nation -may drag the
world into a nuclear war over
territory, again, shows his lack of
knowledge of the situation. It is not
a question of territory but of the
existence of a nation. For some
reasons the Israelis are not willing

Dear Editor,

The “Fuzzyweeks” cartoon ap-
pearing on page 5 of the "January

attempt by Kambic to stereotype

those students of German decent as -

young fascists of the Hitler variety.

In view of the immense amount of
work with which you as editor are

the cartoon could have slipped’

through your hands and into the

It is hoped that in the future you
will examine his (Kambic’s) work

humankind to early matriarchal
communities in which egalitarian-
ism was the rule and positions of
power, leadership and respect for
women was the norm.

Marxist anthropologist Evelyn
Reed who has been researching
these early societies for a quarter of
a century, presented the first
copies of her book to Pittsburgh
feminists at the Women’s Cultural
Festival last week.

It is _Reed’s contention that the
first societies on this earth were
matriarchies and that the subjuga-
tion of women occurred not
because it was somehow decided
that women were innately inferlor--
such a concept is relatively
new--but because the introduction
of private property caused a
class-like struggle among men.

“We Marxists believe that the
degradation was due to— social
causes--not to woman’s biology or
faulty make-up. ..For‘ the longest
period of life we have occupied the
highest and most esteemed level in
the social hierarchy,” said Reed.

But_ this does not imply that,

women dominated men, as current
male supremacist ridicule of the
Women’s Movement suggests.
The society Reed has re-discovered
through her research is not one
where class domination is even an
issue. 1

One might ask at this point why
women have never before been
credited with humanity’s link to
civilization. Reed asserts that male

scholars have always worked under
the assumption that men have a
history but women do not.

“Women are frozen in history,”

she says, “in one large womb.” .

“The sciences, like society, are
shaped and controlled by men.
Women have to develop their own
critical capacity in biology and
anthropology . ’ ’

And this is what Reed has done.
Working with each male assump-
tion as ‘tentative’ and digging for
clues, Reed has written Women’s
Evolution as the product of a
23-year effort of working within
institutions which looked upon her

' personal philosophy, as well as her

findings, as less than desirable.
Women were the early builders of
the means of production, says
Reed, while men were roving
hunters. Women were the chief
producers of the necessities of
social life, she claims, and because
of this they enjoyed a position of

esteem, as well as a signiﬁcant role

in the creation of civilization.
Reed has conﬁdence in the
feminist movement. Perhaps she
knows that her work may release
future feminists from being boxed
into the corner of biological
destiny. .
“We’ve made some gains, but we
want the whole thing. We are
always under the risk of having our
gains taken away from us as with
the abortion struggle,” she says.
As a feminist she believes women
will again assume . power and
responsibility. in society. And as a

”‘””’pThe Month's Pros and Cons

BY KEN MINARIK

A majority of the albums that ﬁnd
their way across this reviewer’s
desk each month are real turkeys,
and this month’s poultry parade
had few exceptions. Let’s look at a
couple of the real losers.

I guess that says enough about the
extent of their current popularity.

Songs like “Look at Granny Run

the Bubblegum Music Hall of

Fame, where. it will -join such,
I momentous groups as 1910 Fruit-/'

the like. Whoopie.

IT’S TIME [Bonnie Bramlett,
Capricorn CP-0l48[ ‘

Three years have passed since
Delaney and Bonnie split. During
their 5 year marriage they recorded
8 albums for ﬁve different labels.
One listen to Bonnie's new It’s
Time suggests that she’ll be look-
ing for work again soon.

Publicity releases for IT’s Time
suggest that Bonnie Bramlett has
been singing like this all her life.
My immediate reaction was to send
condolences to her family and
friends.

It’s Time can best be described as
a collection of old-fashioned raunch
-and-roll. Notice that I left out the
word “good” before the phrase
-“old-fashioned.” _

Songs like “Higher and Higher”

 nd “Cover Me” leave the listener
—-Wtappping his ﬁngers--in boredom.

Somehow, a bawdy and screeching
voice just don’t make it with this
reviewer.

Backed up by superstars like
Gregg Allman on Organ, Kenny
Tibbets on. bass and others, who

could lose? Ms. Bramlett
does--and badly.

For those Delaney and Bonnie
freaks who suggest that I don't
know what a “lusty voice” is, I
suggest that they go make love to a
garbage truck--the noise will

deﬁnitely turn them on.

It is very rare for an album
released in January to be good
enough to be remembered all year.
Of all the albums released in the
first month of 1975, a couple from
Warner Brothers Records appear? to
be good enough to still be around
when the Grammy Awards come
rolling around next winter.

JUST A BOY [Leo Sayer, Warner-

, Br_os. B 2836].

   

\

A lot can be said about this new

album from relatively-unknown Leo ‘

Sayer--most of it good. The album
possesses a very professional
quality, but Sayer refrains from
surrounding himself with the
electronic hokum that has made

' David Bowie what he is today--

trash. _
The drawing of parallels between

LEO SAYER
Sayer and Bowie is inevitable, and
this is grossly unfair. on Sayer’s
part. His lyrics, in contrast to

Bowie’s spaced-out crap, - are _

down-to-earth love songs. Sayer
sings with a novel voice that takes a
while to get used to, but is an
overall pleasant experience.
Sayer’s voice can best be
described as that of an adolescent
Rod Stewart. (Sorry folks, but
that’s the best way I can describe
it. You’ll just have to buy the
‘album in order to see what I mean).
The opening cut, “Telepath,” a
very novel, toe-tapping number
about empathy, is sharply con-

trasted by its side two counterpart,

“When I Came Home This
Morning,” a powerful ballad.

The orchestration of the album is
superior, and overall Just a Boy is a
growing experience.

URBAN RENEWAL [Tower of
Power, Warner Bros. BS 2834]‘
Tower of Power is a tremendous
rhythm‘ &' blues band out of
Oakland, California that has
nowhere to go but up. Tower of
Power could very easily become
THE super group of the seventies.

.They’re that good, folks--the last

time this reviewer dished ‘out
compliments like that was when he
was begging his TA for an A in
Econ 80. _

“Tower of Power is a tremendous rhythm & blues band out of Oakland,__l
California that has nowhere to go but up.” I ,

Tower’s horn section, consisting
of Lenny Pickett, Emilio Castillo,
Steve Kupa, Greg Adams, and Mic
Gillette is nothing short‘ of a
phenomenon. The San Francisco
Chronicle described it as “the
tightest horn section in existence.”

Urban Renewal is a highly U

polished album full of good dance
tunes. The lyrics to songs like
“Only So Much Oil In the Ground”
and “I Believe in Myself” convey
the essence of urban life. Even the
cover photograph of crumbling
buildings convey the overall feel of
Tower’s music...powerful, fast-
paced rhythm & blues with liberal
doses of funky horns thrown in on
the side.

Tower of Power has been popular
on ‘the West Coast since the late
l960’s. But, now the time has
come for Tower of Power to make it
nationally.

BY TOl\./I WASELESKI
Stories of Five Decades by Her-
lmann Hesse. Translated by Ralph
Manheim. Bantam Books, 330 pp.,
G $1.95

A few years back the author in
vogue on college campuses was
.-Hermann Hesse. His books were

carried around like status symbols;

the strange titles suggested a deep,

“other-worldliness" about the
, reader.

Demian, Beneath the Wheel,
Steppenwolf, Narcissus and Gold-
mund, Rosshalde, Magister Ludi—
if one couldn't successfully cope
__with'the more material pursuits of
the QPA, one always had recourse
to"Hesse on the shelf. “I’ve read
Hesse" was invoked like “I’ve
been to the mountaintop.”

D But that was before Carlos Cast-
V aneda, Woodward and Bernstein,
._Erica Jong, et al. Now Hesse is
,handed down to “the kids” in high
school, the way Kahlil Gibran was
before him, or else just packed up
in a cardboard box and stashed in
‘ the closet. Yet though the Hesse

writes it on two levels:

 P s;Moaaay. February‘  7 3, ‘B1955  

Hesse: Author of Self & Wordly Existence

craze is ebbing, his permanent
place in world literature remains
unscathed simply because he’ was
one of the greats, and, frankly, I’m
scared witless to have to review
him, which is the reason for this big
snowjob at the beginning.

The 23 stories in this collection
from 1899 to 1948 reveal new
dimensions in Hesse's develop-
ment. Many of them deal with
dreams and personal anguish, and
seem to have served as the author's
testing ground for the soul-search-
ing novels -he began turning out in
1919.

The anthology is clearly more

important as a historic reference .

than as a storehouse ,of excellent
prose. V

Yet one story that is particularly
good is “The Cyclone” from 1913.
Hesse relates a tale of first love and
the real
cyclone and the emotional one. All
is mined in the end.

Theodore Ziolkowski writes in the
introduction about an instance in
1921 when Hesse’s publisher asked

him to compile a selected edition of
his works. Hesse never considered
himself a good storyteller and later
noted, “There was no doubt in my
mind that, of all my stories, not a
single one was good enough as a
work of art to be worth mention-
mg.

~His later development of unas-

suming, mystical narratives is a far
cry from these early stories.

“The Island Dream” is about a
shipwrecked dreamer who washes
up on an isle of heavenly maidens,
each one more beautiful than the
next and vying to cater to his
slightest whims. The story goes
nowhere, only the description is
interesting. “Edmund” is more
direct, and instead of ﬂeeing
reality, show the student of the
same name forcing reality to con-
form to his desires. Hesse sees
death as the inevitable result.

“The Wolf” is the story of an
animal being pursured by the
village men. The author relies on
his strong descriptive power to
carry the tale, and it is carried well.

He tells of the terrible winter and
the consequent suffering of the
animals of the region. The
wolfpack encircling the village at
night haunts the reader even when
the story is over. Hesse sees the
wolves as masters of the winter
domain and casts the villagers as
barbaric intruders—a good rever-
sal. The peasants refuse to rest
until every last wolf is destroyed,
and the climax of the story comes
when the last one lies dying in the
snow, wailing at the moon, while
the villagers merrily march back to
the village for brandy and coffee.

himself communicating with the

carted off to an insane asylum,
though by no means has he ﬂipped.

“Turkish Delight”: Sexy,

Sloppy ancl Non-porno

BY M.C. PILECKI

Turkish Delight sounds like the
title for a really good porno flick,
and the addendum that the movie
was a nominee for the Academy
Award for Best Foreign Film of
1973 makes it sound like an artsy
dirty movie. It fails on both counts.

Delight is a lush Danish version of .

Love Story, with ‘a bit more raw sex

saw Harry felt“we must come to
grips with such instincts, for at
heart each one «of us is a poor,

And there lies the gist of Hesse’s
early stories: the relation of the
self to wordly existence. Some-
times he rushes headlong, some-
times he meanders through point-
less dreams, but he remains un-

convinced of any solution. Yet_ he a

BY RICK STOUFFER
Associate Sports Editor

The sixth annual Pitt Invitational
Track Meet held over the weekend
at the Field House was a study of
and

Strengths such as the 440 yard
dash where the Field House and
Varsity records were smashed by
Karl Farmer, the mile run won by
“Sparkle” Markley, or the 600 won
by Chuck Mozingo.

There were weaknesses such as
the high jump where the winning
leap was 6’9” well below the
capability of all three Pitt leapers.

_ And there were the questions:

Will Rich Markley ever lose

‘ another race? Is Chuck Mozingo

another Markley? 'Is head coach
Jim Banner actually Jack Benny in
disguise? And ﬁnally, is Karl

' Hnan? '

Although a point score was not
kept for each team, Maryland was
the big winner capturing seven
events to Pitt’s six. . But the Terps
were strongest in the ﬁeld events
’where the Panthers are perhaps a
little weak but are getting better
every meet.

“It was an outstanding meet,”
said coach Banner, striking his

familiar Jack Benny pose‘ while’

talking. “All aspects of the meet
went very smoothly.”

Pitt’s initial ﬁrst place finish was
not long in coming. In the distance
medley relay, a race run for the

 """first time this year by the

Tracksters, the team’ of Pete
Patterson, Ed Toten, Tom Herman,
and Dave McDonald took the
laurels two seconds ahead of their
competition.

The 50 yard high hurdles proved
to be a disappointment to sopho-
more sensation Jay Sharpley.

Having broken the varsity record
Friday night in the semiﬁnals with
a 6.1, Sharpley washigh as a kite
warming up for the ﬁnals.

“I had definitely planned on
breaking the record. Concentra-
ting more on myself instead of the
competition was a big help,” he
said. '

“Last year I was leading (at the
Invite) but three yards from the
ﬁnish Itfell down, so this year I’ve
got something to prove especially
since I’m racing (Mark) Burke from
WVU again.” ’

Sharpley ﬁnished second to Burke
but the reason was he had been
held by Burke on the third hurdle,
something plainly seen by many
spectators but not by the men who
count, the timer-judges. Regard-
less, Sharpley remained cool.

“I still feel good about my race.
I’m looking forward to Michigan
State next week.” ,

Rich Markley passed over the
1000 yard run to compete in the
longer" mile run and still ran a
second faster than Allen Nailer of
Maryland.

“The reason I passed up the 1000
was to get more competition in the

— mile. Ihaven’t been pressed much
.this year and I felt the longer

distance would be better.” The

challenge was what I wanted.”

 Tankers Sink American,

Lose   to Maryland  

BY TOM HALL

split in dual 7 meet action last
weekend with a win over American
University 55-46, and a loss to
Eastern power Maryland 69-44.

The tankers won eight of 15
events in their victory over Ameri-
can, with good performances by
some lesser known swimmers. In
all, it was a ﬁne meet and gave the
Panthers a chance to acquire some
much needed depth.

In an attempt to give /distance _

swimmer Jerry DeMuro some rest
in preparation for his challenge at
Maryland, Jon Suprock filled in
’and won the 1000 yard swim, with

yard event.

John Schepner continued his tor-
rid streak, winning the 50 yard
freestyle in an excellent 22.5
seconds. Scott Moll did a ﬁne job

, in winning the 200 yard butterfly,
Walt Young copped the 200 yard
freestyle with an outstanding
l:50.3, and Jerry DeMuro won the
200 yard Individual Medley with a
2:00.54.

“We looked pretty good against
American," said ‘head coach Dick
Bradshaw in reference to his
team's tune-up for Maryland.

I - ‘_fAgainst Maryland, well, we just

didn't have enough depth to beat a
team like that.”

The Maryland meet pitted two of

DeMuro won the 1000 yard free-
style by nearly ten seconds, beat-
ing Glenn‘ for the ﬁrst time in his
own pool. Helalso set a new Cole
Field House Pool record, eclipsing
theold mark of 9:57.4 set by Glenn
this year. DeMuro’s time was a
fantastic 9:43.6.

In the 500 yard event, Jerry,

trailed his adversary for most of the
race, then came on strong in the
last 25 yards to win in 4243.8, again
setting a new pool record.
John Schepner won the 200 yard

won the 200 backstroke in 2:00.7

and Dave" Reeder avenged ' an‘

earlier Pitt loss in the one-meter
diving, with a win at three meters
with a score of 274.35. 'That was
the end of the good news for the
Panthers.

“We knew Maryland would be
tough to beat,” said Coach Brad-
shaw. “We put Santiago, Templin,
Natali, and Schepner in the.400
Medley and lost by .8 second.”
Losing the relays has been a
common denominator in most of
the Panther's defeats. Maryland’s
record now stands at 7-3, ‘while the
Panthers stand at 3-3.

The Panther’s next meet is at
West Virginia, where their new
pool which was scheduled to be
open has not been completed yet.

be the ﬁrst team to compete there.
If it isn't ready, I hope they (West

of cancelling the meet,” Bradshaw

Panther, Tim Riley taking third.
His face showing the tired look of a
winner, Jupin explained why all
three top ﬁnishers had the same
marks.

“We had a three way tie for ﬁrst - .

so the bar was placed at 6’11” so
the winning jump was 6’9”. We
were all getting heighth and would
have gone higher if not for the tie

Chuck Mozingo was the ﬁrst place

years. I

Getting strong performances from
every team member, the Panther-
Iette gymnasts defeated Temple
University and Bryn Mawr College
over the weekend, in Philadelphia.

Pitt finished the tri-meet with
77.49 points, their best score
against away competition. Temple
came in second with 72.78 points
and Bryn Mawr had 41.6 points.

Lorie Warbutton continued her
ﬁne performance of previous meets
by placing first on vaulting, the

second on the ﬂoor exercise. Shelia
Barber came in second on the
balance beam, Nancy Weisser took
third on vaulting and the beam,

As Pasterick entered the ﬂoor
exercise competition Saturday, the
crowd again applauded with
enthusiasm, and the sophomore’s
eyes lit up in appreciation.

But he 'wasn’t as sharp as the"

previous night. A faulty landing
occurred on his double back, and
on his dismount from the parallel
bars he injured his left knee.

“‘Our routines are starting‘ to
come together,” an exhuberant

gymnastics,” he beamed, and with
good reason: the ‘Panthers had
increased their point, total 30 points
from the previous match.

Don Stevenson contributed two
consistent performances in the
all-around. He scored 49.25 points
against Massachusetts and 48.25
against Cornell, which were his two
best scores this year, and earned
him a second place in the
all-around in each meet.

ﬁne performance came also from
co-captain Maryann Kennedy.

“We got the twenty points on
each event against A except the
unevens," coach Donna DeMarion
commented. “I hope by the end of
the season we will be able to bring
that score up.” '

The scoring of the meet tended to
be low which was partly due to the
appearance of only two of the
expected four judges.

“When there are four judges the
highest and lowest scores are
dropped on each event,” coach
DeM'arino explained. “Then the
other two scores of the judges are
averaged giving the ﬁnal score. But
if there are only two judges then
those two scores are averaged
together giving usually a lower
result. You don't get four opin-

The game remained close for the
next few minutes with Bruce and
Gary Byrd exchanging baskets
until the Indians grabbed a 15-13
lead with eight minutes gone in the
half. But the Cats got two more
field goals from Bruce and two free
throws from Keith Starr to pull in

The Indians then proceeded to
slow the game down even further
with a four-corner offense with at

loose on the baseline for an easy
lay-up.

Fortunately for Pitt, the W&M
squad couldn’t execute, well on
offense tossing the ball away on
several occasions enabling the over
hot-shooting Bruce to get the
Panthers a 31-30 halftime lead
despite the equally ﬁne offensive

’ play of Courage and Byrd.

The pace of the game picked up
slightly in the second half as Ron
Satterthwaite hit the opening shot
to give W&M a 32-31 lead.
Richards and Bruce went back
to work, however, and Pitt was
quickly on-top, 35-32.

After Byrd hit from 15 feet, Starr
and Richards connected to make
the lead ﬁve points, 39-34, which
discouraged the Indians from re-
turning to the four-corner offense.

Defying the advice of Horace
Greele, the Pitt wrestlers went
east. and the young men returned
with a pair of impressive victories.

On Friday, the matmen invaded
Newark to take on Deleware, and
rolled to an easy 30-6 win.

“The Blue Hens were never in the
match, finding themselves down"

24-0 before two meaningless deci-
sions in the upper weight classes
provided their tallies.‘

Pitt received pins from All-Amer-
ican Rande Stottlemeyer and Carl
Roba, while Dan Levine ran his
individual record to 3-0.

‘'1 was impressed by the whole
team," said coach Dave Adams.
“They were aggressive, and they
just wrestled super.”

Saturday afternoon, the Panthers
whistled an even merrier tune in
Lancaster, crushing the Diplomats
of Franklin and Marshall, 39-3.

/T\»\Four falls’ highlighted the match-

giving Pitt six for the weekend. ,
Pins by Kevin Nellis and Stottle-
meyer, his second in two days,
sandwiched around a F ‘& M
decision, provided the_ course
others would follow. . ,
iAnd follow they did. The Pan-
thers did not lose another indivi-
dual match the remainder of the
afternoon.

The other falls were administered .-

by footballer George O’Korn in his
first match of the season, and Carl
Roba duplicated Stottlemeyer’s
feat of two consecutive pins in the
heavyweight class, to end the

""*'g.__ match the way N ellis had started it.

‘ Stottlemeyer ran his own record to
7-0 over the weekend, while Bill
Korth picked up his third straight
victory.

Adams was not amazed at his '
team's performance.

“l’ve been saying all along that
we have a pretty good team here.
Once we got in shape and some
experience, I knew we would be all
right.”

Having lost only four out of their
last 40 indivdual matches, it would
seem as if the Panthers were set as
a team. But Adams does not
adhere to that assumption.

“We still have some positions that
are up for grabs. There are others
that can step right in. For

example, Levine is undefeated, yet
he and 0'Korn will have to wrestle
it out for their positions."

The Cats may have reached a
height needed against Wednesday
night’s opponent. They will be
taking a 5-2 record into a difficult
match, visiting nationally-ranked
Clarion.

After last weekend’s performance
against a pair of winning teams, it
may be time for Pitt’s awakening.
Pardon, Mr. Gressley, but which
direction is Clarion? ,

believes it is best for him.

“I think it's psychologically better
to peak late in the year so you have
more to count on for the big races
like the Easterns and the Nationals.

Right now I’m even a little ahead

I of myself.

“I missed qualifying for the
Nationals by only two tenths of a

I . ued, “so next week at Michigan

sage.  NEWS’—Mo_nday, February 53', 1975, .

Farmer Outstanding in Invitational

“I haven’t run much indoors,”
said Farmer, “butl was looking for
different things to try and track was
a likely choice.”

So far this year Farmer hasn't
been pressed in the 440 and has a
habit of turning his head to look
just where the competition is, an
action surely demoralizing to the
losers.

“People have come up tome and
tell me I slow down and lose time
by turning around but it is just
something I’m in the habit of
doing.” .

Farmer’s big test ‘came in the mile
relay, an event pitting the Panthers
against Maryland, which had run
the event in quicker time pre-
viously than the Cats.

Running the anchor leg of the
relay Farmer took the baton from
teammate Don Betterley and found
himself over 15 yards behind
nemesis O‘Keefe.

the crowd say, “If he can catch him
he’s good.” ' .

Make no mistake about it, Farmer
isn’t just good, he’s fantastic.
Going into the first turn of the
second lap “The golden Flash”
caught the Terrapin and won by
five yards. -

After being named the outstand-
ing track man at the meet Farmer
speculated on what might happen
on Michigan State’s track.

“MSU has a great track andII’ll be
running‘ the 300 yard dash. There’s
no telling what might happen.”

Wearing out his hand shaking the
18 hands of competing coaches,
Coach Banner finally could sit
down and evaluate the meet.

“This was probably the best
Invitational we have had in our six
years,” said Banner. “All aspects
of the meet went very smoothly but
the biggest thing about this Invite
was the competitiveness and spirit
of everyone.”

“Among others Freshman Keith
