Students Not Aware of Reserve Officers Training Program.

By CYNTHIA H. COHEN

I Pitt News Staff Writer

The Reserve Officers Training
Corps (ROTC) is alive and well, but
apparently not thriving at Pitt.

Currently 71 students are en-
rolled in the program according to
C01. Eugene L. Fitzsimmons,
professor of Military Science.

‘TMany students aren’t even
aware of the program or they have
misconceptions about its purpose
or what’s expected of them,” said
Fitzsimmons.

‘ ‘I would bet there isn’t a student
on campus who hasn’t seen Animal
House at least once. —We don’t,do
;:hat'sort of thing. Ithink that we’re

a little more dignified than that,
and we don’t go out of our way to
degrade people,” he said.

Accredidation was lost by the
ROTC program in 1968. -

Credits for ROTC are not
accepted by the College of Arts and
Sciences, though education, engin-
eering and nursing do accept a
small number. This accredidation
battle was fought at the height of
student unrest about the Vietnam
War.

Fitzsimmons believed there was
a “direct correlation between the
dissatisfaction‘ with the’ Vietnam

War and the loss of accredidation

to ROTC.

“We are the instrument of
civilian leadership for the military,
and I don’t feel that we are to
blame for the military carrying out
the decisions of the president and
elected leaders,” he said.

Although soundly defeated by
the House, there have been
numerous proposals stating severe
problems with the all-volunteer
army and the necessity of resuming
some sort of registration for the.
draft.

“If students would view such an
act as a prelude to induction‘ I
would feel _.the likelihood of

Pittsburgh's New Urban"

.-

Renewal Program Tour

By BOB WARMKESSEL .
Pitt News Staff Writer 4
Threebusloads of people, mainly
students from the School of Social
Work, toured Pittsburgh neighbor-
hoods last week to view the city’s
successes and failures at urban
renewal. '
The four-hour tours, held last
‘Wednesday and Saturday morn;

‘ ings, were billed as the School of

Social ‘Work’s .‘V‘Annual Urban
'Analysis.’’ This is the ﬁfth year
these tours have been offered. \

Professor Jim Cunningham han-
dled most of the commentary as
the chartered PAT bus slithered
through the ‘city’s narrow streets
and climbed ‘steep hills-

John Conley, a university profes-
sor and an active "participant in
Pittsburgh renewal efforts, and
several School of Social Work
students alsolprovided information
for the S0-plus passengers.

Cunningham said that the bus
tour showed “the attempts that
have been made to'bring about a
renaissance in Pittsburgh.”

According to Cunningham, Pitts-
burgh’s “Renaissance I” occurred
in the downtown area in the years
after 1945. The main thrust of that
effort was the expansion of
industry and more jobs downtown.

Renaissance I resulted in suc-
cessful new areas, such as the
Gateway Center project. However,
Cunningham said, some sites for
Renaissance I construction were
bought and cleared but_ never
developed. These sites still remain
vacant or are being used for

increased participation in ROTC,”

-said Fitzsimmons,-I‘ “but if
registration is unpopular, and I
suspect that it would be, we may
again become the targets of
student dissatisfaction. ’ ’

Fitzsimmons believed many
students have misconceptions
about the program.

“We are not just interested in
engineers or natural
majors. Here at Pitt we seem to get
a cut from each of the disciplines,”
he said. There has been skepticism
of the existence of if-(OTC within a

Offers Unusual Services

By DEBBIE MARTIN
Alpha Phi Omega is one
fraternity’ on campus that is

immune from being termed “exp-

loitive”. As Pitts only service
fraternity its members have been
involved in community oriented
service projects for 54 years.

“The book exchange is our
biggest project,” said senior Ted
Wein, president of Pitt's Beta
chapter. “Students can sell old
books through us, at their own
prices, to other students the first
three weeks of the term.”

Alpha’Phi Omega makes only a
10 percent proﬁt on each’ book.
Most of this money goes to the
National Society for Autistic
Citizens.

“We’ve raised around $6,000 in
the past three years for autistic
children,” Wein said, “and we try
to promote an awareness of autism
throughout the Pittsburgh com-
munity.”

Other ‘fund-raising projects in-
clude the upcoming “run to WVU”
on November 10. Members will be

Also, the 25-member fraternity

students representing various or-
ganizations are dressed and made
up, then photographed. The
photos are displayed and students
vote by depositing money in a cup
for their favorite “ugly man.”

In addition to this, members of
the fraternity, both men and
women, spend one night a week
keeping score for a league of blind
bowlers at the Strand Bowling
Lanes.

The fraternity is open to “any
undergraduate,” Wein said. An
initiation banquet, held at the end
of the term, features such speakers
as Allegheny Coroner Cyril Wecht,
an alumnus of the fraternity, and
sports announcer» Myron Cope, who
has worked with the members in
their efforts for the autistic society.

Wein said in the future he hopes
the fraternity will become involved
with a local Boy Scout troop.

One of the best ways to lure
students to the classroom. is to
produce an interesting lecture.

Approximately 80 faculty mem-
bers attended a seminar to hear
four faculty members who have
been indentiﬁed as outstanding
lecturers. ,

Giving their views on what
makes an effective lecture were:
Theodore Windt (Speech), John
Cooper (Philosophy), David Wil-
kins .(Fine Arts) and Richard
Cottam (Political Science). Each
professor gave their “formula” of
what works for them
classroom. Stylistically each
differed in their approach but there

were definite commonalities in’

their approaches.

Windt, currently on leave of
abscence from the Speech depart-
ment, teaches Presidential Rhet-
oric. Almost 1,000 students a year
take Windt’s course, one of the
most popular in the university.

Windt .believed his subject
matter was "50-75 percent of the
battle.”

“There is inherent drama in the
presidency. You have to convey
your interest in the subject matter
to the students. It is also necessary
to look at the demographics of the
class. Explain why the material is

in the‘

interesting, and demonstrate your
interest,” said Windt.

Windt tries to make each lecture
a complete piece in and of itself.

“You have three minutes at the
outset of every ‘lecture to grab the
students interest. Work on those
three minutes. You have the
last two minutes to build suspense
for the next lecture. At 22 minutes
after _I start a digression called
Windt’s story time. You have to
give students a break. Writing for
50 minutes is hard work,” -he said.

Cooper a professor of philo-
sophy, believed the best way to
learn to lecture “is by example and
practice. I try to get students to
appreciate a point that I have,”

. Cooper said.

“I write out each lecture in
advance, but don’t just read it to
the class. I may advance a point
and see if the class has understood
it clearly_and ﬁnds it reasonable.”
Cooper said. “And I don’t treat
questions as interuptions.”

Cooper reviews ‘his work before
each lecture. “I want to be freshly

engaged in the material. How can I-

expect students to find the material
new and interesting if I don’t?”
Wilkins teaches courses in Fine
Arts. ’ '-
“A thoughtful choice of topic is
the most important decision to

,make—and the hardest,T’ he said.

“You shouldn’t let. the student
get visually bored—then ‘the
lecture becomes boring too,” he
said. “You have to demonstrate to

Two Dead in Dorm Shooting

COLUMBIA, S.C.—Police were still seeking a motive
Sunday in the shooting spree at the University of South
Carolina which left two persons dead and five wounded.

Mark Houston, 19, of Columbia, S.C., was charged in
the shootings, which broke out about 12:15 am. Saturday
at a fraternity homecoming party. Houston will be
arraigned Monday on two counts of murder and five counts

3-5. of assault and battery with intent to kill, authorities said.

/

M.

He was being held in the Columbia City jail.

Police say Houston, described as a quiet and friendly
student, pulled a gun and sprayed bullets into’ a crowded
recreation roomjat Bates West-a high rise dormitory on the
outskirts of the South Carolina campus. About 100 young
people in the room were attending a Kappa Alpha Psi
fraternity homecoming party.

The dead ‘students were identified as Terrell Johnson,

21, of St. Matthews, S.C., and Patrick McGinty, 19, of
Wilmington, Del.
v- Johnson was attending the party when he was shot and
killed. Four others. at the affair were, wounded.
McGintyt and a ﬁfth student were gunned down on a
sidewalk outside of the dormitory.

Houston was arrested about three hours later in a
dormitory at Allen University, a predominantly black
institution located across town from the University of South
Carolina. He was persuaded to surrender by» his parents,
who accompanied police .to the building and walked out
with their son. A .32-caliber pistol was recovered at the
time of the arrest, according to a university spokesman.

FBI Unaware of ' SLA Connection ' A

_ LOS ANGELES—An FBI spokesman said Sunday the
bureau was “unaware of any ostensible activity between
the SLA and the \Manson Family,” as reported in a
copyright story in the Loi.g Beach Independent,
Press-Telegram.

“We’re looking at the same article. At this point we
have no comment,” said FBI Special Agent Harry Brown,
when questioned about the report. . _

The newspaper said there may have been a merger of
remnants of the Manson cult and adherents of the terrorist
Symbionese Liberation Army and att-ributed the

 

information to unnamed law enforcement authorities.

The Manson family takes its name from cult leader
Charles Manson, who along with four others was ‘convicted
of multiple murder charges including the 1969 murder of
actress Sharon Tate. The Symbionese Liberation Army
made headlines in 1974 with the kidnapping of newspaper
heiress Patricia Hearst. ' t

A series of bank robberies and alucrative credit card
scam that has netted about $2 million are hints of _a
collaboration between the two organizations, said the
newspaper. .

“One thing intelligence agents fear most is the merging
of terrorist and fanatic groups such as the SLA and the
Manson ‘Family,’ ”
saying. “Looks like that's what has happened.”

“Our street sources tell us that the Manson-SLA group
are planning something that will make the Patty Hearst
thing look penny ante” one unidenified intelligence agent
was quoted in the article by’ Mary Neiswender, who writes
frequently on the Manson cult. '

Tube Break Causes Radiation Leak

RED WING, Minn.—Investigators on Sunday found the
break in a steam-generator tube the width of a quarter that
caused a 27-minute leak of radiation from the Prairie Island
nuclear power plant, utility officials said.

The ruptured tube is one of 3,388 in Generator A, one of
two steam generators in Unit No. 1 of the twin-reactor
Prairie Island plant. State and federal officials have said
radiation from the leak that occurred Tuesday was minimal
and posed no danger to plant workers or area residents.

“We have identified the tube which ruptured,” said
Steve London, spokesman for Northern States Power Co.
“At this point we don't know the extent of the physical
break, but there does appear to be onlyqone ruptured
tube.” ‘ ,-

The cause of the break had not been determined, he
said. ' '

Anti - Nuclear Protesters Assault New Hornpshire Plant

SEABROOK, N.H.—Hundreds
of anti-nuclear protesters repeat-
edly assaulted the Seabrook atomic
power plant Sunday but were.
repulsed by state troopers and
National Guardsmen using ﬁre
hoses, Mace and a smoke-spewing
generator. '

Waves of demonstrators twice
assaulted the fence surrounding
the construction site and ripped
down whole sections of it with
ropes. Troopers and Guardsmen

surged through the gap, spraying

Mace and driving the protesters
back along an access road,

But more than 1,000 of them
quickly regrouped and marched a
mile in the rain to the plant
entrance, where they were met by
troopers and guardsmen standing
shoulder to shoulder behind the
main gate. Fire hoses were turned
on the crowd and a stream of smoke

was unleashed from a generator.
But the chanting protesters, clad ‘
in rain slickers and plastic sheets,.

put their backs against the

chain-link gate and defied author-
ities to move them. Utility workers
then empied two water trucks onto
the crowd but were unable to
disperse them immediately. l
The demonstrators eventually
backed off but continued to ‘mill
about in front of the gate.

Some returned to campsites in the

nearby weeds.

Police reinforcements from other
sections of the construction site
were brought to the main gate.
Traffic were blocked on busy US.

Highway 1, the main road through
the town of Seabrook.

Ten people were arrested Sun-
day, bringing to 19 the number
arrested on criminal trespassing
charges in the two-day attempt to
occupy the Seabrook site, long a
focal point for demonstrations
against the use of nuclear power.
One other demonstrator was
arrested on a charge of ‘criminal
mischief. Officers also conﬁscated
gas,masks and other gear from
protesters.

‘Answer To

Education Crisis?  

With the establishment of the U.S. Department of I

Education, one of the most ‘important responsibilities
of government, providing free learning for all people
in the United States, has taken a leap from relative
obscurity toward national prominence. Once part of
the domain of the Department of Health, Education
and Welfare, education now shares prominence with
other branches of federal concern like defense, com-‘
merce, agriculture, foreign affairs, justice and labor.
This rise to national ' eminence could create the
chance «for the'United States to solve some of the
never ending problems that have plagued public
education in this country for years.

Most paramount of these. is the great disparities in
the budgets, and the quality of education, between
rich and poor school districts that depend on an an-
tiquated property tax system. As’ the ﬂight to the
suburbs has continued, the result has been that the

city schools, which have more students with special
problems that require more spending per pupil, suf-
fer budgetary crises, while suburban schools with less
problem students are saturated with money from
taxes on the more valuable suburban properties. In
response to these great differences between suburban
and city schools, some state courts have ruled the

property tax system is illegal, violating constitutional ,

provisions for equal opportunity under "the law.
But no one has found any answer to the problem on a
national level.

Another question the new department must ad-
dress is the continuing decline of the competence of
high school students. Laws in New York and Florida
requiring all high school pupils to pass a test showing
they can at least read, write and do arithmetic
demonstrates the depth of the problem in the United

* States, a supposedly developed country that still has

a surprising number of functional illiterates.

Besides the problems of primary and secondary
education, the department must also grapple with the
crisis that over-extended colleges and univer-

sities—geared for the high volume of students during -

the baby-boom years—must solve as the college age
population declines and fewer people find a college

education a guarantee of instant success and finan-.

cial well-being. More continuing education and ap-
peals to older people are part of the answer, but it
can’t be the whole answer in asociety where colleges
have ceased to be elitist institutions. a

A U.S. Department of Education might offer the
possibility for the solution of these problems, but the
abundant lessons of the recent past illustrate too
clearly that the establishment of another bureaucracy

is not a cure for all government problems’: Pro-
liferation of departments, bureaus, agencies and
councils actually do more harm than good when
responsibilities of the different government divisions
overlap and most of the work completed by the
groups is deciding which has the responsibility of

' dealing with some problem. '

The organization of the youngest cabinet level
department, the Department of Engery, is one exam-
ple of the pitfalls that can damage attempts to
streamline government by expanding government.
Although all government dealings with’ energy were

to be consolidated in this new bureaucracy, other ’
departments have been unwilling to lessen their ,

power by surrendering the energy-related work, and

decision-making on- energy still remains skewed as a-

result.

When the Department of Education is organized
by the president, he must make sure all dealings with
education are taken from HEW and given to the new
department and its staff. This complete shift must
also inlcude the transfer of former new employees
who worked on education programs. Unless-this is
done, President Carter’s bold new organization ‘of
the cabinet is merely the creation of another army of
clerks who do little more than publish studies and

issue regulations, which address the symptoms of

problems without reaching the cause.

Carter and his staff might keep in mind the Carter
campaign promises of four years ago, when he said
he would gut the Washington bureaucracy. . The
_ years of the New Frontier and the Great Society have

shown that an abundance of bureaucrats in
Washington cannot solve every problem, and that a

few more bureaucrats in the Department of ‘C

Education will not ensure that every -American can
read. -

Athlete Exceptional Student With Extraordinary Needs by

 

There have been several articles
in the past year on student athletes
and most of the articles are done

¢,from thepoint of view of people

who are not athletes, but psychol-
ogists, deans, etc., and they all say
the same thing. Everyone is trying
to ﬁgure out why the student
athlete cannot succeed academical
ly. Has anyone ever asked the
athlete his view on the “student
athlete?” if

Being an athlete takes a lot of

work, and being an exceptional,

athlete takes more. Keeping your
body in shape alone-which every-
one should do anyway-takes alot of

‘time and work unless you are

blessed. Most of the athletes on
major college teams are on athletic
scholarships. In actuality they are
being “paid” to play in_ some sort
of sport at a school. Some of these

students never thought of going to V

college, but because of their great

athletic ability, _son_1eone chose ‘

them to play the sport and the
beneﬁts are educational. A lot of
people complain that student
athletes are not meeting academic
standards. If you really take a good
look at a football player’s day and
week, for instance, during the fall
term, how do you thing you’d cope?
Classes, homework, practice,
games, and public pressure--how
many hours does his day have?
When people
athlete-for instance, again, a
football player--they first see the
glamour of him. For most people it

may ‘stop there. Hardly anyone

helps him without expecting some
piece of the glamour; others push
him aside because of their lack of
interest of lack of self-satisfaction.
It seems that people in the school
should try to help the student
athlete instead of hinder him’--he or
she has-a special job‘, plus he or she"

' could put; a; lot more money i'nto’th_ef A .  .
._unai_v‘.ersity._ :.There.' could [be 4-spe_cial . a ‘ '

look at an‘

programs, classes, etc., set up to
help mainly the athlete at no extra
costs. There are plenty of good
people around who do care about
the studentathlete and are not just
out for the glamour;they like the
sport. _ -

I feel that someone should look

» into the present system and talk to
administrators and staff in posi- ’
'tions that deal with the student

athlete and try to discover why it
hasn’t worked and then make’ it
work. I feel Pitt has a lot of great

' athletic talent and none of it should

go to waste. If the right people

aren’t doing the job--ﬁnd people
who can. If we want to be number
one, athletically and academically,
we have to work together. And this
year we hope “Pitt’s a winnerl”

Just when the Pitt offense was

beginning to look as ugly as last
Saturday's weather, Coach Jackie
Sherrill inserted some fresh faces,
,and the 28-7 victory over the
Boston College Eagles wasn't -a
complete waste of time for the
37,000 fans who still had hangovers
from Friday’s Pirate playoff vic-
* tory.

Right from the start, it appeared
Saturday was going to be an ugly
day. The Pitt student body
displayed "incredibly poor taste
when it booed the Panthers’

\ number one quarterback, and got
even more loose-tongued when
_, Rick Trocano fumbled and threw an
 _.:.;‘ interception on Pitt's ﬁrst two
4‘ A offensive possessions.
1:.‘-V But the junior from Brooklyn,
' Ohio silenced the hecklers for at
_ least one series when he led the
' ‘team 80 yards in 14 plays for the
' first touchdown of the game, a
one-vard sprint to the end zone by
p Randy McMillan. Trocano com-
 : pleted four passes during the drive,
’ and completed 8 of 12 passes for 87
yards for the day, before giving up
I  , v the spotlight to Dan Marino.
' When Kevin Benjamin fumbled
the ensuing kickoff, which was
recovered by Pitt’s Butch Baierl,
Sherrill inserted Marino. Rooster
 ' Jones ran for 22 yards on the first
 play, and Marino ran the option

Pitt's coaches have always had a
special place in their hearts for Ray

Pitt News Staff Writer

With‘ 10 minutes left in the
Pitt-Boston ‘College contest, the
Panthers clinging to a precarious
14-7 lead_,_it seemed like a clonegof
the previous week's 10-9 win over
Temple: The Panthers were
playing their usual tough defense
while the offense, plagued by
miscues, did just enough to get by.
As the chilled crowd of 37,000
quietly sat and watched another
mediocre performance by the
Panther offense, many voiced their
displeasure with the defensive
struggle and screamed for the
benching of Rick Trocano. Their
wishes were fullﬁlled when in the
fourth quarter Marino entered the
game and promptly led Pitt to two
scores. Marino finally looked like
the prize recruit Pitt had been
boasting about since last April.
Although he deserves every praise
he gets, Marino is still nonetheless
the number two quarterback and
should not be expected to come off
the bench every game and provide
instant offense.

At every home game a chorus of
boos can be heard whenever Rick
Trocano’s name is heard. It is hard
to understand the logic behind the
criticism. His 15-5 record is
substantial for any big-time quart-
erback. ‘No one doubts that Marino
has the more raw talent of the two,
yet one cannot expect Marino to
step in and produce consistently.

The Boston College game could

the performance of the offense.
The first three series of the game
were marked by one delay of game,’
two fumbles and one interceptions.
The errant throw was a bad pass by
Trocano, yet he showed his mettle
by , taking‘ the Panthers on an
80-yard drive that featured twin
13-yard passes to Still and Bowles.
Randy Macmillan ended the drive
o_n a one" yard plunge. ‘

MacMillan,’ the Junior College
transfer, who has been one of the
stalwart performers on offense,
commented about the offensive
troubles. “Temple was a good
football team, and today was so
cold it was hard to hang on to the
ball. I don't care who’s in
there—Trocano or Marino, we
should be putting some points on
the board. Don’t worry, W611 be
ready for Washington,” said
MacMillan. '

The pattern for the Pitt offense in
the‘ first three quarters was
remarkably the same. The
halfbacks, notably Rooster Jones
and Freddie Jacobs, would rip off
big gainers, then fumble or a
penalty would negate the sizeable
gain. Despite these setbacks,
Trocano moved the club effectively
and didn’t throw another intercep-
tion the rest of the game, so why all

the abuse? _ _
One player who was all smiles in

the locker room was Kenny Bowles,
the senior split end who answered
his critics by catching six passes.

Throughout themseason Bowles has .

The Pitt defense was led once
again by ends Hugh Green and
Ricky Jackson. Green made three
tackles and six. assists, while
Jackson had four tackles and three
assists.

“I thought the defense played
extremely well,” Sherrill said
following the game. “The entire

How good was Boston College?
Well, they had five definite

chances to score on Saturday and

failed on all but one. A better team
might have beaten Pitt, but .now
the Panthers sport a 3-1 record and
visions of a bowl game still ﬂoat in

problem seems to lie in the fact that '

Contrasting Personalities Still No Measure of Success

This is the second part of articles dealing with Pitt
football and its last two coaches, John Majors and Jackie
Sherrill. Today, a look at their contrasting personalities.

One man is an introvert, while the other is an extrovert of
th ﬁrst degree. One could make you shiver with his icy
stare. The other could light up a room with his enthusiasm.

Ladies and gentlemen, meet Jackie Sherrill and Johnny
Majors. ' _

Where personalities are concerned, Jackie Sherrill and
Johnny Majors are as different as Arabs and Israelis. But
an important question must be answered.’ Do personality
and successful coaches go hand in hand?

Absolutely not. A simple glance around the country
dispels this myth. Chuck Noll, who has guided the Steelers
to three Super Bowl victories, is an intelligent man, yet he
prefers to remain out of the spotlight, and nobody
questions his reasons. ‘

One of college football’s legendary coaches, Alabama’s
Bear Bryant, will never be mistaken for Howard Cosell in
terms of grammar, yet his record speaks for itself.

Two years ago, Notre Dame fans wanted Dan Devine’s
head. Devine, who at times appears to come from the
Milton Shapp School of Wishy-Washiness, ignored his
critics, and was coaching a national championship team
several months later.

Which brings us to Sherrill and Majors.

When Pitt hired Majors in 1972, they were hiring more

than a football coach. They were getting a Messiah, a man

salesman.
sell snow to the Eskimos if it meant putti'ng,something in
his own pocket.

Majors was very popular with both fans and press
people. He was energetic, aggressive, and personable, on
the surface. He was a good interview, and the press
enjoyed his company. Fans couldn’t wait to shake Majors’
hand, even though Majors usually was looking straight
through whoever he was addressing (the thousands of

rabid, less affluent Golden Panthers).

Conversely, Jackie Sherrill is perceived by most to be a
private, impersonal type who hasn’t ‘a single ounce of
warmth or compassion. But don’t believe it. Sherrill has
demonstrated, not publicly, a concern for his players and
coaches which is rather admirable.

Like most\major universities, Pitt’s football players have
had their share of run-ins with the law during the last few

years, both ‘under Sherrill’s and Majors’ control. It might

interest some people to know how the two coaches handled

those ' matters.

Unquestionably, Sherrill showed more interest in the
legal proceeedings than did Majors. Translated, Sherrill
was down at the local jail at one o’clock in. the morning

doing whatever he could for the players while Majors was
sleeping. ‘

Majors preferred not to get involved, and didn’t ‘take
much of an active position one way or the other. Quite
simply, his concern for the players generally beganiand
ended on the football ﬁeld, where his status was on the
line. .

When two©Pitt players were on trial three years ago for ’

witnesses was Jackie Sherrill. At that time, he was head‘

coach at Washington State, and came to Pittsburgh at his
own expense to try and help two men he no longer‘ coached.

So despite all the adverse publicity about his image,’
Jackie Sherrill really isn’t such a bad guy, after all.

And Johnny Majors, while a great coach and program
builder, may not be everything his most ardent supporters
believe him to be.

Pitt News Staff Writer

The Pitt women's volleyball team
gained some new respect for its
program last weekend when the
Pantherettes came out on top
among a ﬁeld of all midwestern
teams at the Cincinnati Invita-
tional.

“The tournament’s ﬁeld was

imuch stronger than that of our

invitational last weekend,” said
head coach Mike Hebert. “The
midwest is still stronger than the
east because there are a greater

number of high caliber teams
there.”
Several of the teams in the

tournament, including ‘ Cincinnati
and Indiana, had won invitationals
the previous weekend in the

midwest, according to the coach.

“We are very happy to win this
invitational,” said Hebert. “We
had to beat a lot of good teams to
do it.”' '

In pool play, Pitt started out
against Morehead State and beat
them 15-10, 15-10 and then

overcame Cleveland State 15-9,’
15-5. Wright State provided the

next competition for Pitt and the
Panterettes outlasted them 15-6,
18-16.

In the ﬁnal match of pool play,
the Pantherettes were defeated by
Ball State in an early morning
match 15-9, 15-6.. This tied Pitt for
ﬁrst place in its pool with two other
teams, but due to its play against
those ‘teams, Pitt got the nod for
ﬁrst place.

“The match was played early
Saturday morning and we just
weren’t ready for Ball State,” said
Hebert. “After traveling all night
and playing all day Friday, we were
just exhausted.” '

In the semi-ﬁnals, Pitt faced
Cincinnati University‘ and swept to
a 15-11, 15-13 victory, which set up
the best three out of five
championship match with Wright
State. A
._"‘The final

match was a

   

' at Cincinnati....Cindy

marathon of over two and a half
hours,” the coach said. “It was a
hell of a match.”

After winning the ﬁrst game

15-10, Pitt lost a heartbreaker by
the score of 18-16. In that second
game, the Pantherettes fell behind
14-7 and fought back to tie the
game at 14-all. ‘ '
‘ With that, emotionally draining
loss under their belts, the
Pantherettes lost all composure in
losing game three 15-6, according
to Hebert.

Game four was the turning point
for the Pantherettes in the ﬁnals,
as they came back for a , 15-3
pounding of Wright State. Hebert
made a key substitution, bringing
in Andra Pletz, whom he credits for
helping the Pantherettes to turn
things around. - ~

Pitt~ also won the ﬁfth and
deciding game of the match easily
by a score of 15-9 to clinch the
tournament title.

“I was amazed at the resolve and
determination, and impressed with
the composure the team showed,
especially in the second game,

" even though we lost,” said Hebert.

“The team was up against the
wall, behind in the match 2-1 and
facing a second-place ﬁnish and
they really ‘put it all together.”

Pitt’s next competition will be
this weekend at Houston, with a
dual match against the Cougars
and the Houston Invitational.

“This is a signiﬁcant step above
Cincinatti, as Texas is the strongest
region in the country next to the
west,” said Hebert. “We are in_a
pool with eighth-ranked Texas
A&M and the competition will be
tough.

“But,” he added, “after win-
ning two tournaments in a row
we’ll be up for the competition and
give it our best shot.” '

5 Pitt Runners Dominate

Magazine Race

3

By MARIA SCIULLO
Pitt News Staff Writer

The second annual Pittsburgh
Magazine Marathon could have
been -called the University.‘ of
Pittsburgh Marathon, because
Pitt’s men and women runners
were the dominant force yesterday
morning.

The Panther contingent regis-
tered wins in second through sixth

,.«;,place in the ﬁve-mile event, the

first of the Pittsburgh Magazine
races. Members of the women’s
track team swept the first four
places in their division of the
ﬁve-mile race.

Last week’s winner of The Great
Race, Malcolm East, crossed the
ﬁnish line in 24:18 for first place.
Pitt’s Gary Siriano and assistant
coach Barry Harwick fought it out
for second place with Siriano
(24:42) edging Harwick (24:45).

Next for Pitt was assistant coach
Mel-— Boyd (fourth place), Randy
Bailey (fifth), Bob Landstrom.
(sixth), Rich Laitta (tenth), Mark
Hazlett (eleventh) and Jim Herr-
mann (twelfth).

The race, (sponsored by the

magazine and KDKA radio, was
followed by a marathon. Race
participation was hampered some-
what by Sunday mornings 45-

degree weather and a good deal of
cold rain.’ ‘ 1‘ ‘ ‘

The course itself was simple,
possibly one of the easiest in
Western Pennsylvania. The race
began at the boathouse in North
Park and continued throughout the
roads surrounding the lake.

“I thought it was onevof the
better social running events in
Pittsburgh because of the way it
was covered by KDKA radio and
the magazine," said Siriano.

The Pantherettes were paced by
Margie Lee, who covered the
distance in 32:17. Next was Pitt’s
Brenda Chorpenning (32.25), Mel-
anie Nickerson (32.51) and fourth
place went to freshman’ Terry
McKee.

Both groups.of runners will have
this weekend off. The men will be
competing in the Miller Lite
Classic, to begin at Three River's
Stadium October 21. The ,women
will compete in an unofficial meet
with Washington and Jefferson
College October 20. '

Panther Boaters Suffer Fifth Loss of . Season to Bucknell ’

By ANNA ARLOTTA
Pitt News Staff Writer

Another game down and another
mark in the loss column for the Pitt
soccer team. Friday evening the
Panthers hosted Bucknell and
recorded yet another loss with a 2-0
defeat.

The problem? This is a question
every Panther booter has_ been
asking himself for the past month.
The solution has obviously been
left hidden somewhere in the
lineup. ‘ '

Coach Leo Bemis and his booters
have been unable to come up with

the perfect combinaton of quick-
ness, ball control and accurate
shooting to score goals. The
Panthers need to regroup before
their next contest with Eastern
powerhouse Davis, and Elkins
College on Wednesday evening.

the Panthers‘ took 11 shots on‘
goal—not many attempts to score
on Bucknell keeper Paul Green.

The two teams looked even
throughout the ﬁrst half of play.
The momentum moved back and
forth as neither team. dominated
the other. The_half ended 0,-0.

Twenty minutes in to the second
half Bucknell’s Dave Isley took "a
corner kick from the Panther
goalkeeper Scott Thunberg’s right
side and crossed the ball to
teammate Mark Brotherton who
shot the ‘ball for the score.

Three minutes later the Bisons

scored their second goal. The goal '

came when the Bisons’ Brian
Hossigner passed to Dave Benson.
Benson controlled the ‘ball _and
broke away from the Panther
defense pulling Thunberg out of
the goal. With Thunberg outand
the remaining Panthers unable to
stop Benson he scored the ﬁnal
goal of the night. ’

The Panthers record is now 1'-5-2.

with four of those ﬁve _losses
coming by only one goal. In the

eight games that have been played '

only six goals have been scored.

participate in some serious re-
