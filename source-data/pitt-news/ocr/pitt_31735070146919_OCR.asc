“Talk About It,” they say.

These shirts are part of a grow-.
ing effort to help spread depression
awareness at Pitt through programs
and events developed by the “Give
Depression a Voice: Talk About It”
campaign.

The Talk About It campaign, for-
merly known as “Talk to Me,” is in its

0 third year at Pitt and is evolving at a

time when depression and suicide have
become prominentinthe national me-
dia following tragedies at universities
across the country.

. ' “The programwas created to save
lives,” said Rachel Davis, Pitt student
and committee chair of Talk About It.
The “Give Depression a Voice” initia-
tive willwind downat the end of No-
vember. .

Talk About It is a committee made
up of 28 Pitt students, 10 staﬁ" mem-
bers from the University and four rep-
resentatives from Lead Pittsburgh, a
depression education and awareness
organization, Davis said.

“We develop programs that work
to educate students on what depres:

Shul-1 said amid the_congratula-
tions and hugging that erupted
after Wickenden announced the
results. “We got a lot done,.but I
believe these new members are
more than capable of continuing
that progress. And the turnout
was great. We wanted 20 per-

Shull said he is going to focus
the next two months on ﬁnalizing

the new Board.

Shull said he expects that Stie—

rently serving on the Board, will
bring “the kind of institutional
memory that is vital in'SGB.”

Following the announcement,
Director of Student Life and Board
adviser Kenyon Bonner said he
is excited to work with the new
Board and President Stieber.

“I’ve worked with Molly as a
Board member, and I’m sure she’s
qualiﬁed to continue guiding this

Board. The other candidates who '
won seem like great group to fol-

low up the tremendous Board we
had last year,” he said.

Bonner said he was also en-
couraged by the increase in voter
turnout.

‘ “It’s a reﬂection of the job SGB
has done so far this year and how
their initiatives to increase partic-
ipation came to fruition,” Bonner
said. “It’s a great thing to see.”

stitute, which specializes in helping students deal
with severe mental health issues, andis locatedin
ﬁont of the Petersen Events Center.

Another resource is the T-shirt itself, Davis
said. The shirts are free for students, and those
wearing them have resource cards and will talk
to any student about the Talk About It campaign
and depression. Also, the phone number for the
counseling center is on the back of the T—shirts:
412-643-7930-

James Cox, director atthe Counseling Center,
said there has been an increased number of Pitt
students visitingthe centerfor mental health con-
cems this year. The increase occurred before the
Talk About It campaign started during National
Depression Awareness Month in October:

Cox said that between 450 and 550 students
seek help from the Counseling Center eachweek,
and 35 to 45 percent of these students have some
type of mental health issue, Cox said. Cox said 20
percent of the students with mental health issues
are on some type of prescribed medication.

Anxiety is the most common mental health
issue at Pitt, followed by depression. He said the
increaseinstudentsvisitingthe Counse1ingCenter
isduetoacombination offactors —~theﬁrstisthat
therehassimplybeenanincreaseinmental health
problems across the countiy, Cox said. '

“Some of it is cultural, some of it is societal,
some economic and some due to family issues,”
Cox said. “Anybody can feel depression. It’s not
just one thingthat causes peopletofeel depressed
and there’s not one thingthat causes them to feel
better.” 0

Cox emphasized that the main goal of the
CounselingCenteristo assist the Pitt community
however it can. ’

“Ifyou have afriendthatisdepressed, theﬁrst
thingyou shoulddo is express concern and attach
itto aspeciﬁc issue thatyou have noticed, suchas

lack of attendance in class,” Cox said.

The Counseling Center —— in collaboration
with Talk About It, Western Psychiatric Institute
and Lead Pitisburgh — more students who are
snuggling with depression will use on-campus
resources.

“Depression can affect anyone and everyone.

so we want everyone to know howto puttogether
the signs of depression and know how to get help
before it is too late,” Davis said.

Pitt’s Director of Student Life Kenyon Bonner
agreedwith Davis.

“For so long, people have been afraid to talk

about it because they feel they’re the only people .

Letter” tozthe editor

To the Editor,

Election season is upon ‘us,
and the gatekeepers of respect-
able opinion at The Pitt News are
once again insisting on the “cru—
cial” importance of the SGB elec-
tion (of course, every election is
claimed to be “crucial” by those
who fetishize representative gov-
ernment). But if I may, I’d like to
dispute the idea that elections
have anything to do with students
“exercis[ing] their democratic
power,” as the editors insist.

All the way back to Aristotle,

-it used to be understood that
elections are a mark of aristoc-
‘ racy, where a few of the “best”
people are selected to rule over

. the undifferentiated masses;

free elections in representative

systems produce governments
that are in fact highly unrepre-
sentative of the population at
large in terms of race or class.
In contrast, selection by lot is
a principle of democracyas in
the ancient Greek democracies,

where officials were chosen ran-

domly from the population. If we
want to make our student gov-
ernment democratic, we would
do well to abolish the elected
SGB and replace it with a body
chosen by lot among the student
population.

' This ‘body would have no leg-
islative power, just the power to
enforce decisions ratified by a
majority of students.

THAT’S WHAT SHE SAID

Facebook helps build
modern identities

  
 

Caitlyn Christensen
Columnist

Virginia Woolf walked through the
streets of London on a winter’s night
andwondered about the faces she saw
in the crowd Ezra Pound compared
faces at the metro station to petals on
awet, black bough —— ﬂeeting, beauti-
ﬁll and delicate. As seen onFacebook,
however, the faces in the crowd would
be completely different.‘Selective iden-
tity is the new principle by which we
present ourselves to the world.

A fewweekends ago I saw the docu-
mentary “Catﬁsh,” which is mostly
about Facebook. Without giving too
much of the movie, away, I’ll say it’s
about the identity people construct
on the Internet. We alldo it— picking
which parts of ourselves we want to
present to the world. It’s as simple as
choosingto untaganunﬂatteringpic-
ture or deletingastatus you putup ﬁve

' minutes earlier because you’re aﬁaid

it sounded silly.

Professor B.J. Fogg teaches a class
on this subject at Stanford University.
Fogg’s class discusses one aspect of

Facebook at a time, essentially de-
constructing Facebook element by

element. For instance, the psychol-_

ogy of the proﬁle picture and what it
says about identity. Choose notto have
a proﬁle picture, and all you get is a
question mark—— as though you don’t

know howto deﬁne yourself, orclon’t 

even knowwhyyou’re on Facebookin

the ﬁrst place.

Facebook allows us to construct

' our identity, compiling lists of likes

——favorite books, movies, etc. — and,
indoing so, puts together approxima-
tions of identity. Viewers have one idea
of a personwholists “The Life Aquatic”
as one of their favorite ﬁlms and an-
other idea of a person who lists “Maid
inManhattan.” Summarize yourselfin
musical interests. Pick the pieces for
your mosaic.

So we choose to present ourselves
to the worldinterrns of whatwethink
everyone will understand. The boxes
of likes use pop culture and the me-
diato articulate identity. It’s like every
Facebook proﬁle page is the shortest
personal essayinthe world. Facebook,
above all else, gives us anexcuse to talk
about ourselves in a way that cannot
be conventionally ordained as narcis-

sistic. Take doppelganger week, for
example — when else would we get
the chance to say which celebrity we
thinkwe look like, especially iﬁt’s ahot
one —withoutbeingcalled conceited?
Every status update is a little statement
we make to the world about what we
did today, disregarding a conversa-

' tion’s context. In any other situation, it
wouldbeinappropriate to announce:‘,§I
don’t like this Girl Talk albumas much
as the last one,” without a discussion
already inprogress. But Facebook lets
us shout out our opinions without any
conversation barriers standingin our
way. Context be damned.

I got to thinking about conversa-
tions because we talked about Woolf
in my Forms of Prose class this week
and our interactions with others in
daily life. There are two kinds of for-
mulaic exchanges we encounter most
frequently: social, such as asking for
a coffee at Einstein’s, and phatic, like
small talk or waving hello to some-
one we recognize. Phatic conversa-
tion isn’t necessarily meaningﬁil. We
don’t always carry “Hello” and “How
are you” beyond a level offace-value
engagement, but they keep our op-
tions open for further interaction in

UNCONVENTIONAL WISDOM

 

Courts should let

 
 
  

Jacob Brown
v Columnist

Pittsburgh’s City Council attempted to
block plans to build a new strip club
in the South Side, and I’m utterly con-
fused as to why.

Lawyers representing Pittsburgh
asked three commonwealth judges to
overuim plans to build Club Marquise,
a 5,000-square—foot gentlemen’s club
on West Carson Street straddled be-
tween Station Square and what I like
to call Littlejersey Shore.

« It turns out the lot the club is
plarmed to be built on sits right next
to the Onala Club, a center for re-
covering drug and alcohol addicts.
Keeping abreast of the area, it’s also
on a stretch of road that saw 150 ac-
cidents between 2003 and 2007, the
Post-Gazette reports.

Ordinarily, I’d say these reasons
are valid enough to grind Club Mar-
quise to a halt. But they don’t tell the
whole story.

According to WI‘AE, the city plan-
ning commission passed a 9-0 rul-
ing against Marquise Investments in
2008, yet its effectwastitular at best.
City Council was supposed to hold a
public hearing before submitting the

ﬁnalpaperwork with the decision, but
it never did, the station reported.
After the city had danced around
with the paperwork forafew months,
the investment group appealed the de-
cision. Soon after, good fortune fell in

the investment group’s lap, with zon- ,

ing already approved for the venue.

Commonwealthjudge Mary Han-
nah Leavitt questioned whether the
Onala Club should carry enough clout
that its presence dictate how other
businesses in the area should run,
according to the Post-Gazette. She
also said operating times between 9
p.m. and4a.m. shouldn’t affecttrafﬁc
too much.

As the battle of whether to implant
such a business continues within the
legal system, I’d like to suggest that
having another strip club in the area
would likely do much more good than
harm.

Joe Panzino, the executive director
for the Onala Club, said in an interview
with the Post-Gazette that he could
“name you halfa dozen people right
now who, within [the strip club’s] ﬁrst
month, will be lapsed. The environ-
ment of recovery would be _totally
compromised,” he said.

Additionally, the Onala Club says
on its website that it runs as many as

South Side strip club open

six Alcoholics Anonymous meetings
per day, with sessions starting at 7
am. and after 10 p.m. Outside of a
rehab clinic, few other organizations
operates on such a schedule.

Being aware of the surroundings,
itwould be more irresponsible for the
Onala Club to run thatlate knowing
that its patients suffer from severe
addictions than anything else. Ifpa-
tients wanted to go to bars or strip

ful activities, either. Last year when
the Rivers Casino opened, protesters
claimed that it would lead to wide-

clubs, it’s not like they’re too hard to
ﬁnd on Carson Street or Downtown
anyway-
And those already have liquor
licenses. "
What Club Marquise would guar-
antee with its presence, however,
would be more jobs in the city. From
- constructionworkers renovatingthe
former medical office to the women
performing in it, the club would cre-
ate moretaxrevenue —the majority
likely coming in $1 denominations.
It’s not like Pittsburgh is new to
mass opposition of supposedly sin-

It willalso beneﬁt the city, supple- , V 

menting the tax base and helping to
ﬁll part of the severely underfunded
city pension fund. Strippers have
to pay rent andtaxes like everyone
else. Since the citywillneedto stuff its
metaphorical G-string with $91 mil-
lion by 2016 lest it face a Harrisburg
takeover, I don’t think government
officials should be worrying how the
tax dollars getthere, as long as it’s
legal.

I knowthis city has a selective set
of Puritan values its citizens and rep-
resentatives choose to employ when

affected, as the club offers services be-
yondjusttreatmentfor alcohol abuse.
And, as "stated before, Onala—goers
probably won’t be there during the
strip c1ub’s open hours.

But, this city faces a very real

chance of a state takeover. Its “Most
Livable City” statuscould also be in
jeopardy, as aflarge-‘scale restructur-
ing could cuftlie beneﬁts life-long
Pittsburgherés have enjoyed for de-
Cades; S  a .
So — being perfectly practical
_— it wouldfprobably be in the city’s
best interests to forget about cutting
off Marquise Investments and make
generatingmore revenue atop prior-
ity. The state government is not the
kind of sugar daddy this city would
want to have.

‘127 Hours’ overcomes all obstacles 

_ Courtesy Fox Searchlight Pictures
Think you can make being trapped under a boulder for ﬁve days into a
ﬁlm that doesn’t drag? James Franco (above) can.

Jeffrey Ihaza
Staﬁ" Writer

‘ “127 Hours” \
_ James Franco, Kate Mara, Amber

Tamblyn

Directed by Danny Boyle
Fox Searchlight Pictures
A

A gut-wrenching true story gener-
ally makes for inspiring cinema -
especially if it’s about a man who
saws his own arm off. V

Danny Boyle’s “127 Hours” tells
the gripping tale of Aron Ralston
(James Franco), who spent ﬁve days
trapped in Utah’s Blue John "Can-
yon after his arm became lodged
beneath a boulder. Eventually,
Ralston was forced to amputate it
using a dull knife — but not before
collecting his thoughts on a camera
he’d brought along.

Ralston, a Carnegie Mellon-ed-

A

ucated engineer, begins his journey
pleasantly enough. Traveling up
Blue John Canyon, he encounters

a Kristi (Kate Mara) and Megan (Am-

ber Tamblyn), two young women
whom he charms.

But, after the boulder falls, the
ﬁlm consists primarily of solitary
scenes with Ralston — a directorial
feat only compelling with Danny
Boyle (“28 Days Later,” “S1um-
dog Millionaire”) at the helm. No
stranger to stomach—churning re-
alism, Boyle employs his hyper-
caffeinated cinematic style to turn
an impossibly brief plot into 90
minutes of heart—wrenching cin-
ema.

A script like “127 Hours” has a
lot going against it. Most obviously,
the narrative is merely a motiva-
tional vignette, a story you heard
on the news that takes, a grand total
of ﬁve minutes to explain. But, the
ﬁlm’s execution is so deft that ev-
ery inherent pitfall of telling such a

story is bypassed with ease.

There couldn’t have been a more.» -

perfect casting for the character of
Ralston than James Franco. Hav-
ing demonstrated his versatility in
comedies as well as dramas, Franco
provides the perfect juxtaposition
for Ralston — whose response to
ﬁnding himself trapped against
impossible odds is, “Oops.”
Boyle deals with the blood-
curdling scene in which Ralston
amputates his arm with charac-

teristic ferocity. The same director V I
who had no qualms about showing?“

a starved newborn in “Trainspot—
ting” has no problem letting audi-
ences know exactly what it’s like to
remove your own arm.

“127 Hours” is a rare ﬁlm in that
all components are compatible
with each other: Boyle’s directing
coupled with Franco’s versatility
and a few talented cinematogra-
phers makes “127 Hours” a near-
perfect movie. I

BOOK COLUMN

Hickey: Nonfictionis more than textbooks

Tracey Hickey
A Columnist

Since that fateful day in elementary
school when we were hauled into
the library and taught the differ-
ence between the ﬁction section
and the nonﬁction section, the split
has been clear — nonﬁction is for
work and ﬁction is for play.
But for the past several decades,
that perception has been chang-
ing. According to The Daily Beast,
memoirs are now out-selling novels
by such a wide margin that some
in the book business believe that
we are standing at the deathbed
of ﬁction.

' But even in this most exciting
time for nonﬁction, most of us were
raised on a diet of textbooks and
dry examinations of the Vietnam

. War. So ifyou’re looking to explore

the literature of fact without risking
boredom or the feeling that you’re
doing extra homework, here are
some good places to start.

The comedic memoir: Put sim-
ply, these are fun. A good comedic
memoir is written with a perfect
blend of real-person honesty and
larger-than-life ﬂair. It makes you

‘feel like you’re listening to your

zaniest friend — the one who tells
amazing stories — recount his or
her latest exploits over coffee. David
Sedaris is the current king of relat-
ing incidents with relentless wit
and shameless self-parody, from his
stay in a nudist colony to his brief
stint as an elf in the New York City
Macy’s during Christmas season.
Sloane Crosby, author of “How
Did You Get This Number?” and
“I Was Told There’d Be Cake,” also
hails from the school of comic es-
says — detailing, among other
things, her failed quest through-
out college and young adulthood
to have a one-night stand. For more
self-referential fare, check out Ste-
phen Markley’s “Publish This Book,
a (premature) memoir,” a rollicking
and delightﬁilly “meta” account of
his attempt to publish a book about

his attempt to publish a book.
The serious memoir: Of course,
a good comedic memoir will make

' you think, but sometimes you want

to skipthe jokes and dig into some-
thing more emotional. These are
tricky. Reading the sordid details
of another person’s life can feel un-
pleasantly voyeuristic, and a mem-

my suggestions from my column on
graphic novels: Craig Thompson’s
“Blankets,” a long-but-captivating
graphic novel dealing with faith,
family and ﬁﬁrst love, and Alison
Bechdel’s “Fun Home,” in which
the author comes to terms with
her own homosexuality against the

backdrop of her closeted father’s

Some in the book business

at the deathbed of fiction.

oir that offers nothing but misery
will leave you feeling deeply dis-
turbed, and not in a beneﬁcial or

don’t go in for the likes of “A Child
Called It” unless you want to be sick
to your stomach.

In this category, I reiterate two of

E rnind—expanding way. For instance, ‘

possible suicide. ~

Also exemplary is Maxine Hong
Kingston’s 1975 memoir “The Wom-
an Warrior: Memoirs of a Girlhood
Among Ghosts,” which uses Chi-
nese folktales to make the narra-
tor’s stories of immigrant life in the
’60s leap off the page. A

Educational nonﬁction: My
strongest recommendation in this
category is Gavin de Becker’s “The
Gift of Fear,” which examines vio-
lence and violence prevention from
the date-stalker to the presidential
assassin. Itruly believe it could save
your life. *3

Beyond that, here more than
anywhere you can let your selec-
tions be guided by your preferences
— whatever it is you’re passionate
about, the chances are good that
someone has written an awesome
book about it.

CD REVIEW

Girl Talk still mash-up king

 

Jeffrey Ihaza

Staff‘ Writer
Girl Talk
All Day _ .
IllegalArt '

Rocks Like: The background music to the
greatest night of your life
Grade: A-

Even the Internet can’t contain Girl Talk.

Pittsburgh native Gregg Gillis — or, as

he is professionally known, Girl Talk — has
amassed such a fan base that he successfully
crashed the free download page for his new
album All Day! on his label’s website. It would
seem his growing popularity is a result of two
things: his ear for music and his unrelenting
work ethic.. '
i All Day», Girl Talk’s ﬁfth album, further
sets him apart from run—of-the-mill mash-
up artists whose creative process consists of
thoughtlessly cutting and pasting song pieces
together. When listening-toA//Dy, it’s impos-
sible not to notice the craftsmanship in Gillis’

work-. Every song sampled complements the
previous one, and some of the album’s most
shining moments are the seamless fusions of
Ol’ Dirty Bastard’s “Shimmy Shimmy Ya” and
Radiohead’s “Creep,” as well as an unlikely
combination of Arcade Fire’s “Wake Up” and
Drake’s “Money to Blow.”

The album’s only downside is that it’s meant

to be listened to as a whole. Whereas all of
Girl Tallfs previous records combined trans-
late into an amazing show, they could just as
well-be enjoyed track—by-track. With All Day,
however, imagining yourself in a seamless live
performance is a requirement. Of course, this
isn’t an entirely bad thing for Gillis, seeing
as his concerts are, essentially life-changing
experiences.

Girl Talk is the most notable name in the
ﬂeeting mash-up genre for a reason — he con-
tinues to create amazingly cohesive records.
All D59: is no exception. Though undoubtedly
a better album to hear live, All Dag)! provides

fans with something to be excited about for S

the next Girl Talk show.
Girl Talk will perform at Club AE on the
North Shore Dec. 3 and 4

If you’re interested in politics, your options
are limitless —— but in this arena, remember
that if it sounds scnsationalized, it probably
is. Another caveat for readers looking to be
informed while reading for pleasure: If you’re
seeking to learn about another culture, choose
a book from an insider’s perspective — a na-
tive, not an American traveler. The Carnegie

Public Library has a broad selection of inter- _

national literature in translation, and you’ll
only learn so much’ about another society
reading what Americans have to say.

Of course, I haven’t touched on the semi-

ﬁction of Hunter S. Thompson’s f‘Fear and
Loathing in Las Vegas” and Sylvia Plath’s “The
Bell Jar,” which are classiﬁed as novels but
directly echo the experiences of the authors.
I also haven’t mentioned the joy some people
derive from reading diaries and correspon-
dences — a friend of mine swears that F. Scott
Fitzgerald’s love letters to his wife, which have
been collected in “Dear Scott, Dearest Zelda:
The Love Letters of F. Scott and Zelda Fitzger-
ald,” are far more valuable than the author’s
novels. Another friend’s life was changed by
“The Journals of Sylvia Plath.”

Zanna’s play might surprise
some, but not his teammates.

“We saw the improvement in
Talib last year. Even though he

the No. 5 Panthers pull away late

Pitt (4-0) opened the second

Zanna scored two quick baskets

14 points and nine rebounds, fall-
ing one board shy of his fourth
consecutive double-double.

Meanwhile, Robinson, who
had surgery on Oct. 27, had four
points off the bench in his season

Panthers loo

kto bounce back from loss

T earn "will travel to South lorida to take on resurgent Bulls team, looks to get back ontrack following first B'i,gEast loss last week

Dustin Gabler
For the Pitt News

After losing their ﬁrst Big East
game of the season last Thurs-
day at Connecticut, the Panthers
had a few extra days to reﬂect on
their loss. V

4 But they won’t have too much
time to dwell on the negatives be-
cause they’re traveling to take on
a hot South Florida team tomor-

I'OW at 110011.

The Bulls (6-3, 3-2' BiglEast)

are riding on a recent winning
streak. In past years, the Bulls
tended to slide from the Big East
race in October, but ﬁrst—year
head coach Skip Holtz has USF
playing strong football late in the

‘ season.

“I think we’re_ all aware that

‘ they beat Louisville last week and

that they have won three games
in a row. Playing down there is a

challenge,” Pitt head coach Dave '

Wannstedt said in a news confer-
ence. “We will obviously have to
play a high-level game in all three
phases to get back on track and
keep moving forward.”

But Pitt still controls its own
destiny -— a win against USF
would put it right back on track
to become the conference cham-
pio_n.

The team knows this and is
trying to become bowl-eligible

for the third straight year.

“Right now we have to ﬁnd a
way to win a game, and all that
other stuff really doesn’t matter,”
Wannstedt said. “We have to win
a game, become bowl-eligible and
go from there.” '

Holtz thinks that the Panthers
(5-4, 3-1 Big East) are the most
skilled team in the conference.

“You look at them from a tal-
ent standpoint, and I deﬁnitely
think they’re one of the most

talented teams in this league,”
he said. “I just don’t see a lot of
weaknesses on this team; it will
be a great challenge for us.”

The biggest difficulty thew

Panthers faced against Con-
necticut was what they did to
themselves.

Running back«Ray Graham
fumbled on the kickoff, the kick-
off coverage team let up a huge

return touchdown, and quarter-"'“"

But Thursday was all about
Zanna, who led all Panthers in

K points and rebounds. The red-
shirt freshman is now averaging

9.5 points and 9.3 rebounds on
the season, forming a formidable
defensive duo with the senior
McGhee. Pitt out—rebounded
Maryland, 43-23, and had 11 of-
fensive boards.

Maryland (3—1)‘outshot Pitt in
the first half, but the Panthers es-
caped with a 31-27 lead thanks to
the Terrapins’ horrendous free-
throw shooting.

 Maryland missed all seven

foul shot attempts in the open-
ing half and ﬁnished the game
just 14 for 30.

“They [Maryland] try to do
things that they did in high

school, and they can’t do that’

now,” Maryland head coach Gary
Williams said earlier in the week.
“There has been some sloppiness
on our part.”

The offense that Pitt show-
cased against North Florida and

-success in New York

Illinois—Chicago, meanwhile,
didn’t show up in the Garden for
much of the game.

Maryland denied the Pan-
thers any open looks until Zan-
na’s play down_low in the second
half opened up shots from the
perimeter.

Ashton Gibbs finished with
13 points, and Travon Woodall
and Wanamaker also had double-
digit totals.

Last night’s win at the Garden
continues the winning trend for
the Panthers in New York City.
Pitt’s record at its home-away-
from-home is 25-11 since the
2000-01 season.

Pitt can improve on that re-
cord when it plays the winner
of Thursday’s Texas vs. Illinois

The_Bulls have a defense stock-

known to produce speed.

They will cause many pr0b- '

“They’re very athletic from a

has improved, adding" a power

former coachjim Leavitt.

did lastyear, but some of the plays
are similar. They’lljump in regu-

from what they’ve done in the-

past. They force you to prepare

for two "or three different types of '

attacks depending on the person-
