 

Co-Sponsored Drive
Against Tuberculosis
Will Begin Today

Postponed last week because of Spring Festival, the Men and Women’s
Health services in cooperation with the Pitt News today begins the annual
two-week campaign against tuberculosis.

The campaign was described by campus health leaders Dr. H. C.
Carlson, director of the Men’s Student Health service, and Dr. Auleene
M. Jamison, director of the Women’s Health service as being equally, if

not more important, than the syphilis detection tests.

The health services

will be available for the examinations on Monday, Tuesday, and Wed-

nesday of this week and next.

According to Dr. Carlson the Wassermann tests were conducted first
because the procedure for them is much more diﬂicult than the tuber-

culosis determining tests.

It takes a relatively longer time, however, to
establish the results of the tuberculosis tests.

Also it is pointed out by

Dr. Jamison that a positive test, indicating the presence of the tuber-
culosis germ, is a good sign in most cases.

If a positive reaction is shown after the ﬁrst test is taken there is no
need for alarm stresses Dr. Jamison, for either the person has withstood
the disease, as is generally the rule, or the individual is harboring the

germ.

In either case all individuals showing a positive reaction are re-

ferred to the Falk clinic for an x-ray chest examination.

If the result of the test is negative the individual is in danger of
contracting the disease, and the test should be taken at least annually.
It was further pointed out by both directors that the danger of contract-
ing tuberculosis or of harboring the germ is exceptionally high in the

age groups of college students.

The test in itself is very simple.

However tuberculosis is a curable disease.
A drop of the tuberculosis detecting

serum is injected into the arm, and if in 48 hours no detectable spot ap-

pears, a stronger test is given a week later.

If however, a spot forms

around the place of injection, the individual is referred to Falk clinic for

the x-ray examination.

Because of the nature of the tests, which necessitate a waiting period
after which the test is read,’the schedule for the tests is irregular. The
tests may be taken from 9 o’clock until 5 o’clock today, Tuesday and

Wednesday.

Dr. Jamison stressed the fact that the x—ray examination which is
obtainable at Falk clinic, and which is the only sure way of detecting
tuberculosis, is given under a special arrangement, which enables an
x-ray specialist to conduct the examination for $2, which is $3 to $18
cheaper than if the examination was taken privately.

Charles Boyer Gives $50 Check
For French Nationality Room

. By ALBERT MAVRINAC

Charles Boyer, French-horny actor
and Hollywood ﬁlm star, purchased
the ﬁrst two tickets to the French
club’s presentation of “Tovarich,”
staged by the organization last
Tuesday.

He paid $50 for them.

Boyer was reached by letter
through the efforts of Miriam Har-
ter, ’40, president of the club for
four years, and assistant director
of “Tovarich.”

The play was part of a‘ program
to raise funds for the completion of
the French nationality room in the
Cathedral. Miss Harter, recalling
that Boyer was a Frenchman and
had played the lead in the Holly-
wood version of the vehicle, sent
him a seven page letter, written in
French, several weeks ago.

She explained that the French
room had been begun with the aid
of funds from the French govern-
ment, and that completion of the
project had been interrupted by the
invasion of France last June. She
told of the difﬁcult-ies which had
been encountered when attempts
were made to raise funds.

Boyer responded with a person-
ally autographed photo of himself
on which he had written a message
wishing the French club success in
its venture and in the campaign to
ﬁnish the room.

The photo arrived just as the
curtain was about to rise.

But the picture wasn’t what Miss
Harter had solicited.

She had just about given up hope
of getting any response regarding
the tickets when a letter arrived
Friday, together with the check for
$50, from the actor. The letter,
written in French, once more re-
peated Boyer’s best wishes for the
success of the endeavor but made
no mention of the enclosed check.

« A translation of the letter fol-

‘lows:

Dear Miss Harter:

“Thank you so much for your
friendly letter. I am sending you
my most cordial wishes for the.suc-
cess of the French club at the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh and for your
French play in particular.

In this French room, whose

boy-er writes girl

completion you have not let stop
because of misfortunes that have
fallen on the head of France, may
you make live the thought and the
soul of a country which, rest as-
sured, will not forget the conﬁdence
and the love that are being shown it
by “your great and generous coun-
try” in the most somber hour of
its destiny. It is through efforts
such as yours, dear Mademoiselle,
that the treasures of my country
will be preserved—treasures which
the ambitions of men will never de-
stroy; the wisdom of Montaigne,
the style of Racine, and the thought
of Pascal. I want to thank you
again, and send to you your com-
rades and my sincere wishes.”

The quotation in Boyer’s letter
is an extract from one of Winston
Churchi1l’s recent speeches to the
United States.

While Miss Harter was an un-
dergraduate at the University, in
addition to her position as presi-
dent of the French club for four
years, was a member of Cwens,
‘national honorary fraternity for
sophomore women, Pi Tau Phi, na-
tional honorary scholastic frater-
nity, and had the leading role in
the Pitt Player’s presentation in
1939 of “Kind Lady.”

Float Parade,
Sweepstakes

Rescheduled

‘Rained Out’ Events
Take Place Today

The Women’s fraternity ﬂoat pa-
rade, and the men’s fraternity
sweepstakes, both events on the
Spring Festival Tap day program
“rained out” last Friday, will take
place today on a revised time sched-
ule announces Richard Jones, C41,
chairman of the Spring Festival.

The ROTC parade which was to C

precede the ﬂoat parade has been
cancelled, as has been the ﬂying
demonstration by the students en-
rolled in the CAA ﬂying course.

The ﬂoat parade of the Women’s
fraternities following a “Hollywood
on Parade” theme, will begin at
Tennyson avenue and Bigelow
boulevard at 3:30 o’clock. The pa-
rade will pass down the boulevard
to O’Hara street, along O’Hara and
onto Fifth avenue as far as Univer-
sity place. By way of University
place, the ﬂoats will proceed to
Bigelow boulevard and back to the
intersection of Tennyson avenue.

The fraternity sweepstakes begin
at 3 o’clock near the Physicians’
building on University place. Each
of the fraternities will enter a cart
with a driver and ﬁve pushers. The
pushers, stationed at every 20 yards,
will exchange with a teammate who
will push the cart for the next 20
yards. Each team will be timed to
determine the winner.

Sports day women’s sports, and
the Inter-fraternity track meet,
postponed from last Thursday will
take place in the Stadium and the
Cathedral next Thursday holding
to the previous time schedules of 2
o’clock and 4 o’clock.

In case of rain again, the sched-
ule of events will be announced in
the Pitt News, added Jones.

Circus Theme
In Decorations

Wins Awards

Awards for the best decorated
fraternity houses during Spring
Festival week were presented to
Delta Delta Delta and Sigma Chi
during intermission at the Spirts
dance Friday night. .

The Interfraternity All-Point
trophy, winner of which had been
previously announced, was present-
ed to Phi Gamma Delta. Richard
Jones, C41, chairman of Spring
Festival week, made the presenta-
tions.

Fraternity house decorations
were judged at women’s fraterni-
ties’ open house Monday afternoon,
and at the progressive dance at the
Men’s houses Monday evening.

The tri-delt house, winner of
the women’s cup, was , decorat-
ed to resemble a tent. The Sigma
Chi house, men’s winner, also was
arranged as a big top tent. Judges
stated they thought these decora-
tions ﬁtted the theme of Spring

Festival week which this year was

called Pitt Circus.

Red and gold crepe paper strung
as streamers and pennants across
most of the rooms, comprised the
decorations at the house of the
women's winner while the Sigma
Chi house was similar to the inside
of a circus tent.

The committee of judges includ-
ed: Dorothy Ann Carrier, Ed4l,
chairman; Jack Brady, C42; Freda
Valli, Ed42; Jean Thomas, C43; A1-
do Icardi, C43; Thomas Wester-

Freshman Travels Over Eastern. Battle Front
On Journey From Moravia To United States

. By mvmo. LIEBER

War in Iraq and on the eastern
fronrt appears a little more realistic
to one University freshman than to
most other students.

Leaving Germany controlled Mo-
ravia (a process that became a con-
stant moving and resettling due to
the rapid expansion of Germany
proper and the controlled areas)
and roaming Palestine in search of
a medical education, Frank Winter,
C44, former native of Brno, Czecho-
slovakia, ﬁnally followed his parents
to America and entered the Uni-
versity in February.

Frank’s trip to this country last
year brought him through Arabia
and Iraq with almost as much
trouble as is going on now, the
smiling pre-med relates. Frank

both lived and traveled through
these areas where today England is
striving to quell a pro—Nazi upris-
ing which is jeopardizing Britain’s
vital position in the rich middle
eastern gateway to India.

Soon after German occupation of
the Moravian state in Czechoslo-
vakia in March, 1939, Frank and his
parents, humiliated by the Nazi
anti-semitic program, left their
home for Belgrade, Yugoslavia, to
\vait for permission to come to" the
United States.

During this time Frank decided
to go to Jerusalem, Palestine, to
study at the Hebrew university, a
place that would seem safe enough.
His parents received their visas and
went ahead to America.

Frank spent nine months in Jeru-

salem, studying mathematics and
physics and working on a citrus
plantation. He wanted to follow in
his father’s footsteps and study
medicine, but due to the fact that
Palestine does not have a school of
medicine, Frank decided to come to
the United States. With the Medi-
terranean sea closed, a long, round-
about eastern trip was necessary.

Leaving Jerusalem the ﬁrst week
of June 1940, Frank traveled by
bus for two days and nights across
the hot desert sands of Trans-Jor-
dania and Iraq to Bagdad.

It is quite interesting to note that
Frank’s trip across the Middle East
very closely follows the same route
as the oil pipeline from Kirkuk,
and Kermannhah, in Iraq, to Haifa,
Palestine. The pro-Nazi Iraqi and

O Panther Salesman
Turn to Swindling

Faced with the possibility of
prosecution under a Federal statute
which provides for the prosecution
of offenders obtaining money un-
der false pretense, Panther sales-
men today are seeking to vindicate
themselves of suspicion.

Mendel R. Silverman, C43, is
looking for the person who last
Wednesday handed him a $5 bill
and took change for a one.

Says editor Stauff: “Millions for
defense, but not a cent for of-
fense.” Or something like that.

Dr. Crawford
Accepts Gift

For Bowman

The re—dedication of the Daugh-
ters of the War of 1812 sundial took
place Friday afternoon on the Ca-
thedral lawn outside of Foster me-
morial when Mrs. Joseph W. Marsh,
former president of the National
Society of the Daughters, present-
ed it to the University on behalf of
the Dolly Madison chapter. Dr.
Stanton C. Crawford, dean of the
College, accepted the gift as the
representative of Chancellor Bow-
man.

 In 1914 thefirst dedication took

place when the Daughters erected
the sundial on a pedestal outside of
Phipps conservatory in recognition
of the valor displayed by the Pitts-
burgh Blues, a Pittsburgh regiment.
For six years the sundial remained
on this site until it was replaced.

TWenty—one years then passed
and nothing was done about the
sundial until the Daughters de-
cided to present it to the Uni-
versity.

Monday, while the Dolly Madison
chapter of the Daughters was as-
sembled on the Forbes street side
of Foster memorial, Mrs. Marsh
presented the gift and Dr. Crawford
accepted it.

In presenting the gift, Mrs. Marsh
stated that she was glad to present
the gift to the University, a ﬁtting
place for its erection in as much
as William Foster, the father of
Stephen Collins Foster, was 21 vol-
unteer soldier in the Blues. Dr.
Crawford, in accepting the gift,
voiced the Uni.versity’s thanks and
appreciation.

erts. BA41, president.

The meeting, ﬁrst one of the new-
ly elected assembly, will be devoted
mainly to this business, stated Rob-
erts. Final reports -of the year will
also be given at the meeting.

Retiring members of the execu-
tive committee to be replaced are
Roberts, president; Dave Tucker,
C41, vice-president; Gene Pyle, C41,
secretary; ’Dave _Buente, BA41,
treasurer; Fred Robie, C41; and
Dorothy Ann Carrier, lid-11.

Deans of the schools in the
University will handle the actual
administration of requests for
deferment and will begin their
duties immediately. The deans’
committee on selective service will
serve as a policy forming group,
considering only questions of de-
ferment referred to them by deans
of various schools.

The student-faculty deferment
plan was established at the meet-
ing of the board of deans last Mon-
day.

Occupational deferment may be
possible for men registered in
courses necessary for training in
national defense work. Postpone-
ment of induction may occur for
men who fall in the “unusual indi-
vidual hardship” grouping simply
because of college enrollment.

The following outline was an-

nounced from Provost Rufus H..

Fitzgerald’s office:

1. Upon receipt of the draft
questionnaire, a student applying
for deferment immediately should
prepare, in duplicate, a statement
of information, containing his
status, plans and contracts concern-
ing necessary-to-defense employ-
ment after graduation.

2. Duplicate of this information
should be taken to the dean of the
school in» which the student is reg-
istered. One copy should be sent
to the local board with or included
in the questionnaire.

3. When the dean receives the
copy of the student statement‘ of
his deferment eligibility, an affi-
davit will be prepared to include
the recommendation for deferment
and the reasons for the choice.

4. The
naire, and the aﬁidavit should be
returned to the local board ﬁve

days after the receipt of the ques-.

tionnaire.

5. Any questions concerning
postponement of induction or oc-
cupational deferment
asked of the dean of the registrant’s
school.

Studenrt registrants will be given
consideration for occupational de-
ferment if they are enrolled in the
following courses:

Engineering: civil, electrical,
chemical, mining, metallurgical,
mechanical, agricultural, and sani-
tary.

Chemistry, dentistry, pharmacy,
physics, biology, and bacteriology;
geology, geo-physics, meterology,
hydrology, cartography, and medi-
cine. -
Although no group deferment will

be given, students registered in the ,

courses listed above will receive
“most serious consideration” for oc-
cupational deferment, according to

10,000,000 Voters
Wlitliout Votes

Yesterday, a campaign was begun to bring
more democracy to the United States. Unfor-
tunately, the local newspapers, which are so
enthusiastic about “preserving democracy,” have
given no publicity to the movement.

That movement is known as National Anti-
Poll Tax week, from May ll to May 17. Its pur-
pose is to bring more democracy to the south
by abolishing the poll tax existing in eight south-
ern states.

The poll tax is simply a direct tax levied upon
those who wish to vote. The sum levied is
usually $1.50 or $2.00. As soon as a person be-
comes twenty-one he must pay his tax, before
he can vote. If he does not vote that year or the
nex , the taxes are added up, and before voting
the citizen must pay the sum of his taxes. A
large majority of people, who have not voted for
several years, are required to pay for total taxes
of twelve to twenty dollars, before voting.

As a result, six million poor whites and four
million Negroes cannot vote. Adding these sums
up and using more gathered statistics, we ﬁnd
that these voteless ten million citizens equal
two-thirds of the voting population of the south.
The south possesses “one-third democracy for
one-sixth of the nation!”

The poll—tax encourages and maintains cor-
rupt politics. Tax receipts are bought and ex-
changed by inﬁuencing politicians, mostly Demo-
crats, which accounts for the “solid south.” This
also accounts for the majority of committee
chairmanships dominated by southern congress-
men.

Martin Dies is from the poll tax state of
Texas where only twenty-six percent of the vot-
ing population vote. This congressman, who
has been investigating un-American activities,
was elected to Congress by an undemocratic
process!

The Geyer Anti—Poll Tax bill introduced by
Congressman Geyer of California is buried in
the House judiciary committee and will not be
proposed for consideration before the House.

The main objective of the National Anti-Poll
Tax week is to blast the Geyer bill out of the
committee by getting two hundred and eighteen
signatures of congressmen on a discharge peti-
tion, the number of signatures necessary to bring
the bill before the House.

If this movement is achieved, then perhaps
we can think more of “preserving democracy.”

Men-of-the-Week

Today we praise in edit form our three choices
for men-of-the-past-week.

They are Dick Jones, Rudy Janata, and Dick
Frankovich.

Faced with the cancellation of many of the
events which he had so carefully planned, Jones
took things in stride. Never was there any of
the panic which might have resulted under less
competent management.

Janata carried through the Tap Day cere-
monies without a slip; this in spite of the
weather.

Frankovich carried through his Finale dance
with never an indication of the fact that he had
been unable to proﬁt by the last-three-days pub-
licity usually so important to such affairs.

Level-headedness in the face of upsetting
factors is deserving of at least this small notice.

We should like to see the same intelligent

It is important that all students registered
for the draft and those who will soon be twenty-
one read carefully the stories on pages one and
four of this issue of the News, pertaining to stu-

himself.

‘Summer 1914:’ World
War and the Thihaults

For those who have over-simpliﬁed the causes of
war, for those who misunderstand the growth of the
war psychology upon a people, for those who would
merely know the whys and wherefores of World War 1,
Roger Martin du Gard has written his latest book,
“Summer 1914,” a work which concludes the author’s
series of French middle-class novels known in Amer-
ica as “Les Thibaults.” Those who have already read
of the Thibault family will remember Jacques, the
ﬁery young intellectual; Antoine, his older brother, a
solid block in the foundation of French middle-class
society; their friends the de Fontanins, Jenny, Daniel,
and Mrs. dc Fontanin, and, hovering over the smallest
details of their lives, the inﬂuence of dead Father
Thibault, strong-willed patriarch of the family.

To the normal current of their sluggish lives, du
Gard introduces the disturbing element of war. The
first rumors and predictions of Woixd War 1 are cir-
culated by Jacques, who has joined a movement of
international socialism. Symbolizing the scofﬁng and
indifference of the typical citizen, Antoine, securely
ensconced as a “good” doctor in a moderately rich
neighborhood, laughs down or ignores his warnings.
Through the minds and actions of these two brothers,
and from the feelings of other characters whose types
make up a composite picture of the French popula-
tion, the author traces the effects of national hates, of
government agitation for war, of the inability of the
human intellect to cope with the band-wagon of pub-
lic speeches, parades, and all the other tools that shape
national hysteria.

Socialist Ramparts

One by one the ramparts of peace are undermined
and captured: the socialists, great tongue-advocates
of mass strikes, revolution, and other violent activities
against war, renounce their life-long program of peace
and join forces with the government. In Germany,
where the Social Democrats had organized the most
efficient worker’s party in the world, socialist dele-
gates vote for war supplies and mobilization; in Italy,
where blustering socialist Benito Mussolini had de-
nounced war as imperialistic blood-letting, left-wing
leaders vote to throw in their lot with the allies; in
France, and in England, socialists forget their cries of
“Workers Unite!” and talk ominously of the “heredi-
tary” enemy at the border.

The Story

Picturing the war-corruption of France through the
deaths of Jacques and Antoine Thibault, du Gard brings
to a close the saga of the Thibault family. Young
Jacques, after ﬁnding a brief spell of love with Jenny
de Fontanin, is killed during the ﬁrst weeks of the
war, His death is futile and almost without effect,
and, through the telling of it, the author impresses the
ironical conclusion to all sensitive feeling against war.
Shot by French soldiers as a spy, after crashing in the
plane from which he was to scatter anti-war pamph-
lets, Jacques is left dead under a barrage of German
shells. The war-fresh sergeant who kills him mutters,
as he presses his revolver to the damp forehead of the
boy, “You dirty scum, you dirty scum!” He continues
his reassuring cry of “dirty scum” as he runs to rejoin
his troop.

Antoine, his shell-wounded lungs raw and tortured
by an attack of mustard gas, dies a long-drawn death
of invalidism and despair. The symptoms of his at-
tack are noted and commented on by du Gard, who
was himself a doctor in the war: the pink-tinted
sputum, the shreds of tissue thrown up during a
coughing spell, the sudden pains and interminable
sleeplessness. Du Gard is matter-of—fact in the frank-
ness of his description: the total effect is that of a
tortured life lost through a stretching process of pain.

A Pertinent Question

The novel “Summer 1914” raises a pertinent ques-
tion in the mind of the reader. If international social-
ism could come so close to peace twenty-seven years
ago, before its leaders were seduced to the cause of
war, might it have reached a greater effectiveness an-d
success by 1940? In summer 1940 France. was wracked
by a series of paralyzing strikes; utter misconﬁdence
and frank hatred reigned between social classes; Ger-
man armies,‘ opposed by soldiers who were ill-armed
and morally uncertain, swept through the plains of
France with a minimum of blood-shed and destruction.
Had the people of France reached a new understanding
about war? Had they ﬁnally realized that such men
as Jacques and Antoine Thibault must no longer be
sacriﬁced to blind-eyed soldiery?

Will the world someday wonder, when it has grown
old enough and intelligent enough, whether the victory-
glorious France of 1914 was more triumphal than the

geqsggned and beaten France of l940?—William Banks,

Well over a month ago Victor
brought out an album which sold
out the very ﬁrst day. One local
store, for example, sold ten copies
that ﬁrst Saturday. Since then the
demand has made it impossible for
the stores to keep the thing in stock.
The album, by the way, is the ﬁrst
recorded concert of the “no doubt
world-renowned NBC_’c Chamber
Music Society concert of Lower Ba-
sin Street.” Guest stars are vocalist
Dinah Shore and Sidney Bechet
playing the seldorn—heard soprano
sax.

If ycu’ve ever heard the Cham-
ber Music society’s concerts on the
air, you know the type of music
they feature——ba.ss clarinets, bas-
soons, celestes, and—oh yes, the
usual trumpets and reeds. The
effects are unusual while still be-
ing pleasant and not incongruous.
The society is dedicated, if you
didn’t already know, to the pres-
ervation of the three B’s-—Barrel-
house, Boogie Woogie, and the
Blues.

Best feature of the album is Di-
nah Shore’s renditions of “Mood
Indigo” and “Dinah’s Blues” back-
ed up respectively by Maestro Paul
Laval and his Woodwindy Ten and
by Dr. Henry “Hot—Lips” Levine
and his Barefooted Dixieland Phil-
harmonic. Actually, the ﬁrst outﬁt
is practically an enlargement of the
second.

Most unusual record, we think

affair.

Al. I. Gator Tells
About Shakespearean
Boogie Woogie
is “Shoemaker’s Holiday” featur-
ing bassoon throughout. The art-
ist, the program notes tell us,
“knows very well that a double-
reed instrument can’t possibly be
swung, and . . . he . . swings
his bassoon just to be obstinate.”
Other selections include “Musk-
rat Ramble” (with Bechet on sopra-
no sax), “Runnin’ Wild,” and “Ba-
sin Street Blues.” We also strongly
recommend the descriptive booklet
that comes with the album. It’s al-

most as enjoyable as the records
themselves.

We don’t imagine Shakespeare,
were he alive today, would be tick-
led that Bob Crosby’s Bob Cats had
whipped together an album of
songs from his works. Not that they
aren’t good Dixieland, but they
haven’t any reference to Shake-

Editor, the Pitt News:

The biggest joke in our colleges
is the spectacle of half—baked col-
legians sporting military uniforms.
They swagger through the halls,
show oﬁ on the campus, and escort
palpitating coeds to military ex-
travaganzas, a la Hotel William
Penn and Benny Goodman. At the
end of a four-year circus, during
which time they learn exactly noth-
ing about mass psychology, these
emaciated youths are commissioned
into the regular army of the United
States. Around such a nucleus is

built the defense of our fading
democracy.

0 Rah Rah Boys

The Reserve Ofﬁcers’ Training
corps affords impatient rah rah boys
a short cut to glory. Rather than
subject the youth to vigorous disci-
pline and» hard work, this quasi-
military organization ﬁlls the boys
with fanciﬁed ideas about the life
of a gentleman and an ofﬁcer. It
is not enough to sport a Sam Browne
belt. It is not enough to be “well
braced with straps and suspenders.”
It is not enough to be a Tuck shop
parasite or a lounge and cocktail
champion. Life in the armed serv-
ices is a- life of hard work and give-
and-take. The man who escapes
the enlisted ranks is not ﬁtted to
become an officer.

0 Road to Glory

That road to glory should be well
paved and not a short cut. We
should make it impossible for any
man, particularly college youth, to
attain that goal except by the hard
way——enlist-ment in the ranks, and
advancement from there on, de-
pending upon personal aptitude and
personal merit. This must be the
standard for our officers if we are

Indiuna’s Relay Victory
Noses Out Pitt Trackers

Indiana trackers stole a page out of a Frank Meriwell book
last Saturday afternoon when they came from behind 111 the ﬁnal
race of the day to nose out the Panther squad 65% to 651/3.

V\'ith Pitt ﬁve points to tile good alld only the mile relay race left
on the program, the Olsenlnen visioned all upset victory over the In-

-diana team, but the nationally
famed quartet of Campbell Kane,
Roy C«3c'n:'an, Jenkins, and Burnett

Pilams Tackle
Powerful Fiji
Foe in Top Tilt

Having led the league through
the ﬁrst half of the season, the un-
defeated Phi Gams will risk their
perfect record against the Pilams
in today's leading contest.

Backing hurler Bill Colvin is an
inﬁeld and outﬁeld that is hitting
up to par, but is woefully weak de-
fensively for a championship outﬁt.
In the early part of the season, the
hitting of Ken Grossett, Bob Quick,
and “Stoney” Bitner have featured
every contest.

Facing the Phi Gams on the
mound will be one of the best twirl-
ers in the intramural circles, Marty
Faberman, and backing him is a
slugging offense lead by burly Hil-
lard Kreimer.

Another top-notcher, the Delts,
present holders of third place, tussle
with the “hot and cold” Sigma Chi
nine.

Although the Sigma Chi team
started out in ﬁne style, they have
played mediocre ball in their last
few starts and for this reason they
must be placed as underdogs.

It has been the direct opposite in
the Delt’s case for after losing two
straight in the earlier part of the
season, they have triumphed in their
last ﬁve contests. Big guns for the
surprising Delts have been Hawk-
ins, and Krunkleton.

In another of the top games, the
second place Phi Eps will tangle
with the boys from SAE. Backing
pitcher Jay Silverberg with one of
the best slugging and ﬁelding teams
in the league, the Phi Eps have very
little to fear in this game other than
the slugging Walt West.

The same is true of the game be-
tween PiKA and Theta Chi, for the
slugging of the Wildes, Anderson,
and Davis should make this a one
sided victory.

Also on the day’s schedule is the
game between last year's fading
champion Sigma Alpha Mu and
Lambda Chi Alpha.

covered the distance in 3:20.7 to
beat the Pitt team.

Bullet Bill Carter again played
the role of the outstanding man on
the Panther squad as he netted 15
points by taking three ﬁrsts in the
100-yard dash, 220-yard dash, and
broad jump.

Harris Double Winner

Archie Harris, Negro ﬁeld event
ace, was Indiana’s only double win-
ner and only record breaker. Harris
threw the discus 163 feet, 31/2 inches
to shatter his own record made in
Bloomington last year. Harris also
won the shotput with a heave of 49
feet, 4 inches.

The meet hinged around the fact
that Pitt was deﬁnitely superior to
Indiana in the clashes, while the
Hoosier team excelled in the mid-
dle distances.

Dusty Rhoades was probably the
most versatile man on the ﬁeld last
Saturday, for he tied for ﬁrst in
the pole vault with teammate Jess-

The scheduled tennis match be-
tween Pitt and Indiana State
Teachers college was cancelled
last Saturday morning because of
cold weather.

up, took third in the discus throw,
third in the shot put, and second
in the javelin throw.

Hap Stickel did not fare so well
as was expected, for his only points
came in his second place in the 100-
yard dash, and his second place in
the 220 low hurdle race.

Jim Elliott, Penn Relay javelin
champion, came through with valu-
able points for Pitt when he easily
beat the ﬁeld with a throw of 178
feet, 8 inches.

Anderson Surprise

As was expected before the race,
Indiana's Campbell Kane, Roy
Cochrane, and Archie Harris play-
ed an outstanding part in the Vic-
tory of their team. Cochrane holds
the vvorld’s indoor record for the
440-yard dash, but scored his only
ﬁrst of the afternoon over Stickel
in the 220-yard low hurdles.

Del "Anderson fared better than
the critics thought he would when
he placed second to Kane in the
880-yard race. Anderson's sur-
prise second gave the Pitt forces
hopes until the ﬁnal race of the day,
when the strong Hoosier team swept
to victory.

EIGA’s Torrid
Race Too Stiff

For Pitt Team

Tigers, Hoyas Drop
Panthers From Race

If Coach Art Underwood and his
Panther golf team had any vision
of surprising the critics by winning
the EIGA championships, they re-
ceived a severe jolt last weekend
at State College, Pa., when the
top ranking intercollegiate golfers,
Princeton and Georgetown, trounc-
ed them by the scores of 7-2 and 6-3
respectively.

Perhaps the only bright spot in
the trip to Penn State was their up-
set victory over the favored Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania squad, 5-4,
in the opening round robin match
on Friday afternoon.

At the present time Georgetown,
Penn State, and Princeton are tied
for the lead in the Eastern Col-
legiate Golf Association race witth
4 victories and 1 defeat apiece.
These league leaders will take part
in a playoff next Friday at Stan-
ford, Connecticut, and the win-
ners will meet the Northern divi-
sion champions on Saturday. The
two defeats administered Pitt last
Saturday knocked them out of the
running for the championships.

In the opening round of the week-
end play, Pitt's sophomore Harry
Simpson and senior Jack Glenn
came through with sensational play
to nose out Penn, 5-4. The match
was tied at 4 apiece when Glenn
and Simpson met Merkle and Wes-
sel of Penn. At the end of 18 holes
the contest was still knotted, but
ﬁnally at the 22nd hole the Pitt
duet came through with victory.

Bob Seybold, Jim Butcher, and
Jim Walkingshaw also counted to-
ward the Pitt scoring.

The next day was a bad, very
bad, day for the local golfers. In
the morning they faced a powerful
Georgetown foe, and ended up on
the short side of a 6-3 score. Simp-
son and Glenn again played stand-
out golf for the Panther forces
when they tallied the only blue and
gold points in the defeat.

Assuring thelnselves of their ﬁrst Winning campaign in three
years. Pitt's baseball forces ran their season’s record to seven Wins
and two losses Saturday by knocking off \Vest Virginia, 7-5 and 5-3.

Mountaineer coach Ira Rodgers threw two lefthanders, Charley
Seabright and Garnett llorrison. against the Panthers, alld both
hurlers responded with ﬁve-hitters, but walks, errors, and Pltt’s

capacity to hit with men on re-
sulted in the West Virginians’
seventh and eighth losses in 10
starts.

Righthanders Edgar Jones and
Bob Malloy did mound duty for
Pitt. Malloy turned in somewhat
the better job, yielding eight hits
for his fourth consecutive win,
while Jones, though getting his
third victory without a defeat, was
belted hard in the late innings.

Jones started the afternoon in
hot water. Mountaineer shortstop
Hal Grossman cracked his third
pitch into the stands.

The Panthers went out in; front
to stay in their half of the ﬁrst, but
it was through no doings of their
own. Seabright opened by walk-
ing both Eddie Straloski and Al
Bush, and the pair advanced to
second and third on Jones’s sacri-
ﬁce. Ernie Bonelli drew another
pass and so did Vaiksnor, tieing the
score. Catcher Guy Guadagnino
sent a long ﬂy to Strauss, Bush
scoring and when Hockenberry
threw wildly past third in an ef-
fort to catch Bonelli coming into
the bag, Ernie also tallied.

Grossman and Sloman hit succes-
sive singles III! the third, and Hock-
enberry walked. With the bases
loaded, Strauss fanned, but Jones
hit Doliner on the arm with a pitch
to force in a run.

The Panthers picked up another
in the fourth. Grossman threw
high to ﬁrst after ﬁelding Guad-
agnino’s grounder, Malloy tapped
in front of the plate, Hockenberry
making a poor throw to second, and
Buz Updegraﬁ scratched a hit off
Seabright’s glove. Guadagnino
came in on Stra1oski’s ﬂy to Doliner.

Singles by Bonelli and Vaiksnor,
brought a marker in the ﬁfth, and
followed by Guadagnino’s long ﬂy,

ship. They have yet to meet the
Fijis, and this game may easily de-
cide on which mantle piece the
league trophy will rest.

Tied for third place are the Delts
and Phi Kaps, who must win all of
their remaining contests if they
wish to have any chance at all for
the championship. The Phi Kaps
started out fast and for a while rest-
ed on top of the heap, but then they

fell off and now show a record f
ﬁve wins in seven starts. Pitcher
Mike Sotack and Frank Dax are
standouts for them.

Bob Bentley, Harris Hawkins,
Bob Jones, Ken Krunkleton, and
Johnny Stall have been the big
guns for the Delts, who have made
a surprisingly good showing.

Notwithstanding the fact,
they lost their ace performer, Lou
Mendlow, the SAM nine have dis-
appointed their followers. Expected
to put up a real battle to hold the
league crown, which has been theirs
for the past two seasons, the Sam-
mies quickly fell by the wayside
and now ﬁnd themselves in ﬁfth
place. An erratic outﬁeld and a
weak inﬁeld have handicapped
them, and only the battery, Red
Silverman and Harry Abromowitz,
have come up to expectations.

Cards Pace Independents

In the independent circuit, the
Cardinals lead the pack with two
wins in as many games. Steve Ma-
tiyak and Gleeson have been the
standouts for the Cards.

The Bus Ads and APD are dead-
locked in the runnerup spot with
one win and no losses. However,
anything can happen here because
of the limited number of games
that have been played.

Last season's titleholders in the
engineering league, Oil&Gas, have
triumphed only once in four games
and thus are tailing far behind the
leading AE&ME seniors, who
haven't been beaten in four starts.
The Chem juniors are in second
place one game behind the leaders.

instructions received by local boards
from national selective service
headquarters.

The present deans’ committee on
selective service is composed of Dr.
E. A. Gilmore, dean of the School of
Law; E. A. Holbrook, dean of the
Schools of Engineering and Mines,
and Dr. Stanton C. Crawford, dean
of the College.

“Membership on the present com-
mittee will be increased to repre-
sent all areas concerned,” according
to Dr. Gilmore, chairman of the
committee.

At the meeting of the board of
deans last Monday, the motion es-
tablishing a deferment set-up was
passed, stating “that the existing
committee (committee on selective
service) be continued, and expand-
ed in accordance with the action
taken last month; that this be a
policy forming committee and the
actual administration of student and
faculty requests for deferment be
delegated to the school deans, who
will carry out the policies of the
central committee.”

Anticipating a student deferment
suggestion to local boards from the
national director, the board of deans
formed a committee at the April 16
meeting to inform draft boards of
deferment eligibility of faculty and
students. '

Deans of the various schools have
selective service regulations and
the policies of the University com-
mit'te'e'ini' their olﬁces and are pre-
pared to answer questions concern-
ing deferment or postponed induc-
tion. - ,

men,‘ is secretary of the deans’
committee.

Ellen Geyer to Teach
At Yearly Conclave

Miss Ellen M. Geyer, professor
of English, will attend a meeting of
the National Association of Second-
ary School Principals at Pennsyl-
vania State college, as a group lead-
er and consultant, from June 30 to
August 8.

These yearly summer sessions are
held for those who wish to do pro-
fessional graduate work in the sum-
mer, and who wish to re-ceive full
credit for this graduate work in
the University, the University of
Pennsylvania, or Pennsylvania State
college.

Along with the training period,
which wi.ll consist of various work-
shops of study groups, will be a
planned recreational program in-
cluding hiking, swimming, riding,
golf, tennis, music and dancing.

The complete project will consti-
tute a full summer’s work, and ad-
mission will be by application only.
Further information may be ob-
tained in 1808 Cathedral, Miss Gey-
er states.

Business Level
Continues Rise

Continuing on its general rise of
the year, the adjusted index of bus-
iness in the Pittsburgh district ad-
vanced 13 points last week, accord-
ing to the Bureau of Business Re-
search of the University. Resump-
tion of bituminous coal production
accounted for the greater propor-
ion of the rise. a

At the reopening of the mines, an
immediate reaction was noted in
other industries, and the usual sea-
sonal peak in "many of the major
industries in the district has now
been passed the bureau states. Steel
mill activity in the Pittsburgh dis-
trict has already responded to the
resumption of work in the coal
mines. The current operating rate
of the steel industry, however, is
still considerably below the rate
prevailing in late March.

The index shows that rail and
river shipments rose decidedly last
week, and further gains are expect-
ed.

Arriving in Bagdad, the great city

today is under the bombardment

From Bagdad, Frank traveled by
rail to the port of Basrab on the
Gulf of Persia, where he boarded an
English ship sailing for Calcutta,
India. From Calcutta, by way of
Thailand, Borneo, Java, Singapore,
the Philippines and Hawaii, Frank
arrived on August, 1940, in what
he called, “a very wonderful and.
beautiful country!’

Unable to enter the University
last September, because he lacked
sufficient knowledge of English,
Frank attended Schenley High
school until February.

Enrolled in the College as a first
semester pre-med freshman, Frank
now can follow his original plans
for an education, provided his back- .
yard doesn’t come over here.

Vital Student Deferment information

Lanfear Lists Draft Provisions

Prospective draftees enrolled in any school in the University should
read the following summary of the facts pertaining to the postponement
of student induction, occupational deferment, and the right of appeal
from local boards, compiled by Dr. Vincent W. Lanfear, dean of men, and

secretary of the deans’ committee on selective service.

The information,

condensed from the American council on education bulletin of April 16

follows:

I. Deferment to ﬁnish session,
semester, or year.

A. The Selective Training and
Service act of 1940, has been re-
vised to allow at least ten days for
reporting after the date the order
is mailed, provided, however, that
where unusual individual hardship
will result, the local board (wheth-
er or not the report for induction
has been mailed) may postpone the
time to report for a period for in-
duction not to exceed 60 days from
the date of such postponement. Fur-
ther postponement may be granted
upon good cause. Unusual hard-
ship may result if the registrant
requires additional time in which
to:

1. Recover from illness.

2. Be available in event of ill-
ness or death in family.

3. Complete a course of training
or instruction.

4 Take an examination
completing such a course.

5. Make arrangements with re-
spect to the registrant’s individual
business.

6. Perform other similar acts.

Numbers 3 and 4 above apply to
students completing courses either
in summer session or in regular
academic year. They apply to any
student regardless of his course or
year in college. Such postponement
of induction must be decided by the
facts of each case, since there will
be no group deferments.

B. A student may procure from
the local board a fairly accurate es-
timate of the time he will be called.
If a student’s order number is such
that he will probably not be called
until after the summer session, se-
mester or college year is well along,
and he has enrolled in good faith, it
is possible that the local board will
interpret such a case as an unusual
individual hardship and postpone
his induction until the end of that
session, semester or year.

C If, as seems probable, those
who have become 21 since October
16, 1940, are required to register
October 16, 1941, they will fall

after

. within the group for whom “unu-

sual hardships” will exist since they
will be enrolled and well along in
their courses before their order
numbers will be determined. If
registration is held during the sum-
mer the same principle will apply
to the new registrants.

D. In the case of a student hav-
ing a low order number where he
will probably be called shortly after
the beginning of a college year, lo-
cal boards may decide no “unusual
hardship” exists even though the
student is enrolled and in attend-
ance. Such a student may be run-
ning the risk of being inducted
without postponement and should
consider requesting advancement

of his order number, so that he will
be inducted and complete his pe-
riod of training without interrup-
tion of an academic year. No at-
tempt is made to fix the number of
days or weeks of required attend-
ance before an individual is post-
poned because there are too many
variable factors. The local board
should consider all the factors be-
fore making its decision.

11. Occupational deferment for
men “in preparation for an occupa-

tion essential to the national health. '

safety or interest.”

The following procedure is rec-
ommended by the national head-
quarters of the Selective Service
system.

A. The board is to place all those
who are in class ID and 113 in some
other classiﬁcation. Local boards
have authority to defer certain stu-
dents in case the student registrant
is a “necessary man” as authorized
under the Selective Service regula-

tions. Each case must be consid-
ered individually upon its own
merits.

B. Any student in Class ID,

who has received his questionnaire
from his local board should prepare
immediately, in duplicate, a “stu-
dent statement of information,”
giving complete information as to
his status, plans and contracts with
respect to engagement in necessary
employment upon graduation. One
copy of this “student statement of
information” should be given to

the local board; the duplicate
shciuld be given to the local board;
the duplicate should be delivered
to the dean of the school in which
the student is registered.

C. Any student who has not yet
received his questionnaire from
from the local board should, upon
its receipt, prepare his “student
statement of information” and at-
tach it to or include it in his
questionnaire. He should then
take it to his dean, who in turn
should prepare an affidavit de-
scribed below. The questionnaire
together with the “student state-
ment or information” and the Uni-
versity aﬁidavit must be returned
to the local board within five days
of receipt of the questionnaire by
the student.

D. The University, upon re-
ceipt of the copy of the “student
statement of information,” should
prepare an affidavit. giving a tran-
script of the stu<lent’s record and
other information concerning his
ability and qualiﬁcations. This af-
ﬁdavit, together with the “student
statement of information” must be
transmitted without delay to the
local board. The afﬁdavit should
include such recommendation or
request f or deferment and reasons
thereto that the University may
choose to make.

The affidavit prepared by the
University must be signed by a No-
tary Public and charge may not be
made for such service.

III. The Right of Appeal.

A. Students have the right to
appeal from the decision of the lo-
cal board in cases of occupational
deferment and postponement of in-
duction.

Any student who has questions
concerning postponement of induc-
tion or occupational deferment
should consult the dean of his
school.

‘Classical \lVee-kly’ Receives
Quantity of Foreign Books

By HORACE M. UMBERGER

“Classical Weekly,” one of the
several magazines published at the
University, devotes a major portion
of each issue to book reviews of
classical publications which origi-
nate not only in the United States,
but in a dozen European nations.

Signiﬁcant is the fact that enough
books still come from a war-torn
Europe to supply the “Weekly”
with ample copy for its reviews.

Only recently, Dr. James Stinch-
comb, editor, and Dr. J otham John-
son, associate editor of the journal,
received four books in one week
from Germany. These were sent
to the United States by way of
Siberia and Japan. Occasional
volumes also come from Sweden,
Holland, and Hungary. The re-
mainder of the continent evidently
has ceased publication of classical
material.

English books are coming in reg-
ularly, though they may be two
months in transit. Consistent im-
ports of works of major importance
come from the Oxford University
press and Macmillan. Last Sep-

tember the ﬁnal part of the Greek-
English Lexicon, a large dictionary,

ing at that time was part three of
Cook’s gigantic work on Zeus, the
most thorough-going study of an-
cient religion yet made. And an
English syndicate is proceeding
with the preparation of a new Latin-
English dictionary with an almost
“business as usual” attitude.

The editors of the “Classical
Weekly” obtain recently published
books by two methods. First, pub-
lishers and authors, having the
magazine on their lists, send copies
to the University as soon as they
are printed. The second method
consists in a careful sorting out of
the books which appear in the pub-
lishers’ weekly or monthly bibli-
ography, put out by most foreign
countries. These books are chosen
for their value to classicists in such
ﬁelds as ancient language, litera-
ture, history, science, and arch-
aeology. On request, publishers

then furnish review copies of the
selected works.
