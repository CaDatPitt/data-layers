International
students boost

region’s economy

Gideon Bradshaw

Aiym Kaiyrlykyzy will not have student loans
to worry about when she ﬁnishes her master’s
degree at Pitt. Instead, the government of Kai-
yr1ykyzy’s native Kazakhstan is paying for her
education so that she will return and help the
country modernize.

But if she doesn’t come back, her parents
could lose their apartment.

Although this contract might sound harsh,
Kaiyrlykyzy said it makes sense to her.

“I completely support [the Kazakhstani
government’s] decision,” she said, “because
why should they pay for you to come here and
get nothing out of it?”

Kaiyrlykyzy is one of 2,892 international
students from more than 110 countries cur-
rently enrolled in the University’s degree pro-
grams, accordingto ﬁgures compiled by Pitt’s
Ofﬁce of International Students.

Students from outside the United States are
studying in the counuy’s universities in record
numbers, accordingto a report released Mon-
day by the U.S. Department of State. There are
almost 820,000 such students in the United
States this academic year, according to the
report. This represents an increase of more
than 7 percent from the previous year.

Some of these students, like Kaiyrlykyzy,
receive living allowances and tuitionfrom their
own governments, while others rely on their
families to pay for their schooling at Pitt.

Whatever means they use to pay their tu-

ition, the international students who come

to Pitt and other area universities to study
contribute signiﬁcantly to the economy.
Huanxiaotu Wang, a Chinese student pur-
suing a master’s in foreign language educa-
tion at Pitt, said her parents are paying for
her to study in the United States. Although
she described her family as “not particularly
wealthy,” she said her parents are civil ser-
vants who saved enough money to send her
to the U.S.

Kathleen Musante started her anthropology
career sitting in Mexican kitchens in 1970.

Musante, director of Pitt’s Center for '

Latin American Studies, won the 2013 Sheth
Distinguished Faculty Award for Interna-
tional Achievement on Thursday for her
work in medical and nutritional anthro-
pology in Mexico, Honduras, Brazil and
Ecuador. She was one of two members of
the Pitt community to receive a prestigious
Sheth Award for International Achievement.
Approximately 40 people attended the cer-
emony held in the Lower Lounge of the Wil-
liam Pitt Union.
Studying nutrition and health worldwide
is a lifelong passion for Musante, who said
she gained the. most insight into other cul-
tures by being in their kitchens surrounded
by men and women, “but also by chickens,
guinea pigs and goats.”
In her travels, Musante studied the tradi-
tions of indigenous peoples in South Amer-

ica and what the food they eat means for
their health. She introduces many students
to these cultures through various programs
at Pitt, including the annual Latin American
and Caribbean Festival. Musante also works
with Hispanic populations in Pittsburgh

‘ to ease the transition into the city and its

culture. .

As she accepted the award, Musante said
she hopes more Pitt students will have the
opportunity to study abroad, and pledged
to make a donation to the study abroad en-
dowment “so that more of our students can
sit in kitchens.”

I “I believe the.most effective way to get
our students involved in global issues is to
get them out of their dorms and into the
kitchens, themselves,” she said.

Alongside Musante was Kakenya Ntaiya,
winner of the Sheth International Young
Alumni Award. Ntaiya, who ﬁnished a doc-
torate program in education at Pitt in 2012,
is also nominated for the CNN Hero of the
Year Award for her girls’ elementary school
in Enoosaen, Kenya.

In Ntaiya’s home village, girls are typi-
cally married by age 12 or 13, and she,
herself, was engaged to be married at age
5. When Ntaiya was a young teenager in
Kenya, she experienced female genital muti-
lation, which formerly was a common prac-
tice there. After the completion of Ntaiya’s
school and efforts she made with the Kenyan
government, female genital mutilation is not
nearly as common or accepted.

“That’s one of the things I‘ do when I’m
accepting the students,” Ntaiya said. “I lis-
ten to their stories. Most of them tell me
that they want to be lawyers. They want to
be doctors. None of them will go ‘through
the cutting or be married when they are 12
years 01 .” .

Winners of this year’s International
Photo Contest, which is sponsored by Pitt’s
Study Abroad Ofﬁce, were also honored
during the ceremony. The annual contest is
open to students, faculty and staff who want
to enter photographs they took while they

 illusions of democracy: Young adults
engage in social protest in lieu of voting  

Natalie Russell
' Colummlft

“If you don’t vote, you have no right
to complain.” So goes the tired tru-
ism of the defensive voter. Then
comes the “lesser of two evils”
argument, followed swiftly by the
diatribe about “civic duty.”

In late October, a heated debate
between Russell Brand andjeremy
Paxman went viral. Brand — known
by most as a spandex-wearing
British comedian and ex-husband
of singer Katy Perry —— proved, if
nothing else, that he’s much smarter
than he looks.Anditallstartedwith
a question: “Is it true you don’t even
vote?” '

Paxman posed the question,
which Brand then conﬁrmed.

“How do you have any authority
to talk about politics, then?’.’ Pax-
man asked. Suddenly growingvery
serious, Brand replied, “I don’t get
my authorityfromthispre-existing
paradigm, which is quite narrow

and only serves afew people. I look i

elsewhere for alternatives that
might be of service to humanity.”
Alternatives such as the Occupy
movement and the Million Mask
March,'which occurred on Nov. 5,
are just some of the ways the op-
pressed classes — minorities, the
LGBT community, working class cit-
izens and other underrepresented
groups —— are ﬁnding their voice in
a country where they are system-
atically silenced. They aren’t just
passively or apathetically avoiding

the polls. It’s disillusion with mo-

menuim. According to the Harvard
Public Opinion Project’s bi—annual
poll, young people aged 18 to 29 are
increasingly less likely to vote. In
2008, 63 percent of young people
answered that theylwould -“deﬁ-
nitely” be voting, compared with
48 percent in 2012. It would seem
that Brand isn’t the only one disil-
lusioned by the process ofvoting

in the United States and the United .

Kingdom. Brand is, after all, not
technically a U.S. citizen. But the
massive support for his political
advocacy from U.S. citizens shows
thathe canjustaswell speak on their
behalf.

On the surface, voting is the
quintessential symbol of political

Panthers look to gain bowl eligibility with win

~Ty1er Pecyna ,
Assistamf Sports Editor

Fresh off its ﬁfth win, an uplifting triumph

against Notre Dame, Pitt’s football team will u ' I

become bowl—eligible with at least one more
victory inits remaining three games. Recent
history might not be on the Panthers’ side,

but lady luck hasn’t exactly been kind to their _

opponent for Saturday, either. -

Though the Panthers (5-4, 2-3 ACC) have
appeared inﬁve consecutive bowl games, it has
taken them two shots to get their sixth win in
two of the past three ‘seasons.’ _A

This season’s squad gets its ﬁrst go at reach-
ing bowl eligibility against North Carolina,
which is riding aithree-game  streak

despite losing senior starting quarterback ‘_

Bryn Renner to a separated shoulder on Nov.
i. The injury, which Renner suffered while slid-
ing after a quarterback scramble, was ableak
end to both his North Carolina career and also
what appears to be the team’s bowl hopes.

The Tar Heels (4-5, 3-3 ACC) replaced the
gunslinging Renner, who ranks third all-time
at North Carolina incareer passingyards and
second in touchdowns, with Marquise Wil-
liams, aﬂeet—footed redshirt sophomore who
led the team to a 4544 win against Virginia
last Saturday. ‘

Pitt’s coaching staff noted that there was no
noticeable drop-off in talent under center for

given Williams’ freakish skill set.

“The guy they got playing right now is
really, really athletic,” defensive coordina-
tor Matt House said. “It’s a little bit different
now. Renner was really good, and he threw
the ball around really well — but this guy, he
does more.”

Head coach Paul Chryst added, ‘-‘He’s ath-
letic and has a live arm. Obviously, they trust
him quite abit. He has good weapons around
him. I think he’s dangerous.”

North Carolinainthewake of Reriner-’s injury; _ —

  

House described North Carolina’s offense
as up-tempo, which is why the electric Wil-
liams found playing time even when Renner
was healthy, seeing snaps as a read-option
quarterback. Williams and the briskly-paced
offense are buoyed offensively by one of the
country’s top tight ends, Eric Ebron, and a

- stable of sturdy nmning backs.

Ebron, a junior, leads the teamwith 46
catchesand 690 receiving yards, and has

- three touchdowns on the season. His 6—foot-

4, 245—pound frame makes him a coverage

against Tar Heels

mismatch for cornerbacks, and his sneaky
speed allows him to slip by most linebackers.

“I thinktight ends, in general, are toughif
you’ve gota good one, and he mightbeas good
asthereis inthe country,” Chryst said ofEbron.

The Tar Heels boast a diverse running at-
tack, featuring three runners who have gained
at least245 yards this season. One is Williams.
The other two are seniorA.J. Blue and sopho-
more Romar Morris, who both average over
four yards per carry.

“They are all a little bit different,” Chryst
said of the committee of backs. “Every back
I’ve everbeen aroundhasbeenalittle bit differ-
ent. They’re not all the same guy, and we’ll see
alot of different guys with the ball. We have to
make sure we’re sound against whoever isin.”

Pitt failed to defend the run effectively
against Notre Dame, yielding 133 yards, but
the effort was-balanced out by the Panthers’
own dominant offensive line. The collection of
bruising offensive linemen provided redshirt
senior quarterback Tom Savage the time and
space he needed to throw for 243 yards and
two touchdowns. .

“I thought we did a lot of good things
[against Notre Dame], and you can put the
offensive line into that group,” Chryst said.
“It wasn’t like there was all of a sudden some
great transformation. We made some plays
for different reasons, and the offensive line

Pitt tournament

Sports Editor

Pitt basketball begins play  its ﬁrst touma— .

ment of the season Sunday, as the Howard
Bison visit the Petersen Events Center for the
second consecutive year.

No, this tournament doesn’t carry the
same implications as the ACC‘Toumament
or NCAAToumament held later in the season,
but the Legends Classic is one head coach
Jamie Dixon and the Panthers_look forward
to, nonetheless.

“We signed up for the Legends, which is

one of the best ones,” Dixon said. “It’s Brook-
lyn. It’s national TV. It’s all of the things we
want to be a part of.”

After Pitt plays Howard Sunday and Le-
high Wednesday, play shifts to the Barclays
Center in Brooklyn for the tournament’s semi-
ﬁnal and ﬁnal games. But to make it there,
the Panthers (2-0) must ﬁrst beat the Bison
(2-1) Sunday.

Pitt enters the game off a 75-54 victory
against Fresno State in which the Panthers
used a zone defense to hold the Bulldogs to
37.3 percent shooting, but Dixon acknowl-
edged that improvements could be made to

the defensive scheme.

“Against the zone, obviously they attacked
the high post,” Dixon said. “Once in a while
they’re going to get it in there, but it didn’t
seem that we adjusted well enough or un-

' derstood.”

’ - Freshman guardjosh Newkirk shouldered
some of the blame and said he learned a good

v, deal about his role in the zone defense from

watching ﬁlm in recent days.

“In the zone, I really wasn’t comfortable
with where I was supposed to be,” Newkirk
said. “So I learned alot in the zone, just cover-
ing the middle and getting out to the shoot-

ers.

In the post, Talib Zarma, Derrick Randall
and Mike Young put forth another excellent
performance on the glass. The trio combined
for 25 of Pitt’s 48 rebounds, and together they
accounted for the same number of boards
pulled in by the Bulldogs.

As always, the Panthers hope to exploit
the rebounding advantage.

“We’re trying to do this from nonconfer-
ence to conference,” Randall said. “Me, Talib
and Mike, we’re just trying to rebound the
best.”

  INTERNAITONAL

Chinese students such as Wang account for
1,481 — more than half— of the international
students at Pitt, according to ﬁgures Kati Von
Lehman of Pitt’s Office of International Stu-
dents provided. '

Wang said that graduate programs are
cheaper back home, but much harder to get
into. .

“In China, there are many students who
are applying for graduate degree [programs]
to get better jobs,” Wang said. _

Wang said that when she ﬁrst came to
study at Pitt in the fall of 2012, she was he-
sistant to spend money. This was especially
true before shewas used to American money
and had to mentally convert prices to Chinese
yuan. A hairbrush, for instance, costs one or
two U.S. dollars in China, but could easily run
for about $6 in the United States. '

Although some basic items are more ex-
pensive in the United States, Wang said elec-
tronics cost afraction of what they do in China.

While an iPhone 5 could easily cost about
5,000 yuan, or more than $800 back home,
Wang bought one in Pittsburgh for about
$200. —

“Ina [Chinese] workplace, ifyou see some-
one who has an iPhone, it means they are ve
wealthy,” she said. ' "

Sahar Alkatheri, a Saudi Ph.D. student
in Pitt’s School of Health and Rehabilitation
Sciences, said electronics are cheaper in the
United States than in Saudi Arabia.

While an iPhone 5 might run‘ for 5,000
Saudi riyals — about $1,300 — back home,
Alkatheri said she bought one in Pittsburgh
as a gift to her brother for only a few hundred
dollars.

November 15, 2018 i The Pitt News I wvv\/v.pitinevvs.c0m

The Saudi government is responsible for
the inﬂux of Saudi students at Pitt and other
American universities. As of 2012, there were
more than71,000 Saudi students like Alkath-
eri studying abroad on full-ride government-
sponsored scholarships with living allow-
ances, according to ﬁgures compiled by the
country’s Ministry ofHigher Education. More
than half of them study in the United States.

Von Lehman said 105 Saudis studyinPitt’s
academic programs.

.Saud Alsubaie, another Saudi Ph.D. student
studying rehabilitation sciences at Pitt, said
the Saudi government requires that students
submit their grades to the government ev-
ery semester to show their progress toward
adegree. ,

Alsubaie said he doesn’t know any Saudi
students in Pittsburgh who have lost their
scholarships, though he said he does know

one Saudi undergraduate at La Roche College "

in the North Hills who did not graduate 
four years. The student signed an agreement
with the Saudi government to complete school
within another year. He went on to complete
his bachelor’s degree by the end of that year.
Most Saudi students take English as a
second language before they fulﬁll language

proﬁciency requirements set by American -

universities, and the Saudi government pays
for up to two years of English instruction for
students in addition to paying their tuition
once they’re admitted to a program.

Rob Mucklo, an instructor at Pitt’s English

Language Institute, said 81 of the 175 students .

in the institute are Saudi.
The Saudi government also covers living
expenses when it sends its students abroad.
Alkatheri said she receives about $1,800 a
month as her living allowance from the Saudi
government. University Dammam, where she
was working before she came to study in Pitts-

. burgh, contributes another 5,000 riyals — or

more than $1,300 dollars — monthly.

While Saudi oil money lets the kingdom
be more liberal with spending on students
it sends abroad, Kazakhstani students who
go to school on their government’s dime face
more stringent requirements.

Since the early 1990s, the Kazakhstani
government has sent students abroad on full
scholarships as part of Bolashak, which means

V “ﬁ.iture”inKazakh, the state language. More

than 2,000 Kazakhstanis now study under the
program. Kaiyrlykyzy said that all but one of
the nine Kazakhstani students currently at
Pitt are part of the program, which provides
a living allowance along with ﬁill tuition.
While Alsubaie said other Saudi students
must have a grade point average of 3.75 on
a ﬁve-point scale to qualify for government
scholarships, Bolashak requires that appli-
cants have a GPA of at least 4.5 out of 5.0,
which is the grade scale used at some under-
graduate universities inthe country. A
The Kazakhstani government requires that
graduate students in the program maintain a
minimumiGPA of 3.0 while they study abroad.
Kaiyrlykyzy said the requirements in
Bolashak make her and other Kazakhstani
students more likely to studythan go out, and
she said nobody she knows has faﬂed out of

the program.

“We save money every semester from our
monthly stipends and then spend it on vaca-
tions,” she said.

She and her boyfriend, who studies in C01-
orado, went on a roadtrip across the United
States last July, visiting Mt. Rushmore and
Yellowstone National Park along the way.

“We called it PAto CA,” she said, pronounc-
ing the letters in the state abbreviations.

She and about 20 friends, all Kazakhstanis
studyingindifferent parts ofthe United States,

went to the Dominican Republic last year dur-
ing winter break. I _ -

Kaiyrlykyzy, who earned her medical de-
gree in 2010 from Karaganda State University
inceni1‘alKazakhstan, isworkingonamaster’s
degree in public health.

In addition to high grades and proﬁciency
in both English and Kazakh, students who
apply to Bolashak to study abroad also take
written psychological tests and learning-style
assessments. ‘

The ﬁnal evaluation for the program
consists of an interview by a panel of about
eight or 10 members, Kaiyrlykyzy said. These
members include academics and government
ofﬁcials. She said her interview lastedabout

halfan hour. _
For Kairlykyzy, who was workingas a stat— _

istician for her country’s Ministry of Health
when she applied for the program, questions

included both epidemiology, which she stud- I

ies, and other topics, including her couniIy’s
history. ' V V
“I think they want to ﬁnd someone who

’ will represent Kazakhstan,” she said.

Students also agree that they will work
for the Kazakhstani government or one of
the countryfs private companies _for at least
ﬁve years after they complete their programs.

Bolashak scholars sign a contract with
their government that they will comply with
the program’s requirements, usually using
their families’ home as collateral. _

While these requirements sound harsh,
money is tightfor the former Soviet republic,
which is trying to rebuild some of its. infra-
structure. _

Karaganda State University’s medical
school used to be ranked among the best of
all those in the far-ﬂung Soviet Union. This

was partly because of Jewish doctors who
worked there as instructors after former Pre-
mierjoseph Stalin forcibly relocated them to
Karaganda from outside Kazakhstan.

These doctors have long since ﬂed to Israel
or died, and the school has suffered for it.
Kazakhstan has few of its own medical and
scientiﬁc professionals to replace the Soviet-
era cadre that helped build the counu'y’s in-
_frastructure, and the governmentis willing to
pay to train doctors and other professionals.

Students in the program receive a living al-
lowance adjusted for costs oflivingwhere they
study. In Pittsburgh, that equals about $1,600
a month and money for books. The Kazakh-
stani government also pays for a round—trip
flight home every year.

few researchers in Kazakhstan use.

Although Kairlykyzy likes to save money
to travel, she said she does like to go out to eat
and enjoys steak and seafood, which are more
expensive in Kazakhstan than in Pittsburgh.

Asteak dinner that might cost the equiva-
lent of $80 in Kazakhstan costs about $25

extremely expensive ir1 her landlocked home

“Here you can have sushi for a snack,”
Kaiyrlykyzy said.

— Many Saudi students look for restaurants
that remind them of home.

Alsubaie, who is also the president of an
organization for Saudi students at Pitt, said
that his club orders food that is halal, or pre-
pared accordingto Islamic dietary guidelines,
for its events.

During a celebration of Saudi Arabia’s in-
dependence day held _at Pitt last month, the

club paid Salem’s Market and Grill, a Middle
Eastern restaurant and grocery located on
Penn Avenue in the Strip District, to feed the
500 attendees.

Abdullah Salem, amanager at Salem’s Mar-
ket and Grill, estimated that international
students make up about 5 percent of the busi-
ness’ customer base, which includes 300 to
400 people per day. _

Salem said many people from Middle

. Eastern countries are often looking for halal

meat. Inladdition to forbidding pork, Islamic
doctrine prescribes guidelines for how the
animal should be slaughtered.

Salem said the meat he sells is butchered‘.

locally using traditional methods, which is
what many people visiting Pittsburgh from
abroad are looking for.

“We do everythinginwhole—carcass form,”
he said. “If you want to buy a whole sheep,
we’ll sellit to you.” .

Shireen Attar, a manager for Aladdin’s

Eatery on Forbes Avenue in Squirrel Hill, a
Mediterranean restaurant that is part of a
regional chain, estimated that 30 to 40 percent
of the more  120 people the restaurant
serves every day are international students.
Alkatheri said that she enjoys places that

' serve Arabic cuisine, like Salem’s and Alad-

din’s, but she also enjoys the chance to try
American cuisine. One of her favorites is The
Cheesecake Factory, which has a location in
the South Side. A '

Alkatheri is also a shopper.

Although Alkatherii doesn’t shop every
month while she’s in Pittsburgh, she estimated
that when she does make infrequent trips to
the mall, she might spend up to $500.

She said that while it’s easy to ﬁnd a de-
signer shirt for about $55 in Pittsburgh, “The
best price you can get in [Saudi capital city]
Riyadh is $200.”

“In November, because of Black Friday, I

an effective way to maintain the illusion of de-

“Stop voting. Stop pretending. Wake up.

Recent trends show that the oppressed
classes are ditching the voting booth and re-
directing their energy to promoting change.
A glimmer of this revolution started with the
Occupy movement, and now more instances
of political agitation are happening insmaller
spurts. On Nov. 5, also known ‘as Guy Fawkes
Day, Brand and nearly 1 million supporters
across the globe marched in public protest of
corporate greed and corruption. Guy Fawkes,
an English Catholic, is best known for his par-
ticipation in the failed Gunpowder Plot of
1605 — a plot to overthrow the Protestant
Kingjames. In pop culture, Fawkes’ image was
revived by the 2005 ﬁlm “V for Vendetta,” in

Chancellor Albert Novak in 2012.

A scholar and marketing chair at Emory
University’s business school, Jagdish Sheth
taught at numerous universities, including
Columbia University in New York and the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology in
Boston. He has also worked in the market-
ing industry. ‘

Jagdish Sheth, who spoke periodically
throughout the ceremony, closed the event.

He compared each student who does
something exceptional to a diamond that
was cut and polished by a diamond cutter.
Pitt, he said, is the diamond cutter.

“It is somebody else that gets the poten-
tial out of you,” Sheth said. “This country
seems to have a knack for getting excellence

whichlan anarchist revolutionary in a Fawkes

If more young people are talking about frack-
ing instead of twerking, we’re heading in the
right direction.”

Now the redshirt senior, in.his last season

The Panthers -and Tar Heels last met «

Dec. 26, 2009, in the Meineke Car Care

But the teams aren’t ﬁxated on that bowl

I think you just gotta focus play by play. 
It would be fun, especially forlthe older

a lot, so it would be cool to get that extra

Chryst echoed the quarterback’s senti-
ments, adding: “We want to make it to a
bowl — absolutely want to do that —— and
it’s_ a chance to play one more game with
a team. And when you like a team, you get
to extend that. That part has value and  it
signiﬁes you achieved something and truly

Still, Chryst’s goal is to win Saturday.

Ever since it began 13 years ago, 96.1
KISS FM, or, as the station would de-'
