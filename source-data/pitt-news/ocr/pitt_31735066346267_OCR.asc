Four Full-Time» Clergymen

"Join Heinz Chapel Program

A new system of cooperative ministerial presentation of
service has been developed for this year’s Heinz Chapel

program. '

Four full-time Protestant ministers have joined the
Chapel staﬁ to ﬁll the vacancy left by Addison Leitch, last

year’s visiting chaplain.

MC Plans Pormal
Christmas Dance

‘For Early Dec.

Men’s Council decided at their
weekly Thursday night meeting to
hold this year’s ‘Christmas Dance
on Friday, December 8 from 9
p.m. ’till 12:30 a.m. in the Cathe-
dral Commons Room.

A committee has been organized
under the direction of Tom Mell-
ers to screen assistants for the
formal affair.

The Council budget of $150 for
the coming year was presented at
this meeting.

A plan was proposed to bring ‘
professors to’ speak and hold‘
discussions in the lounges on
each floor of the men’s dorms.
Questionaires passed out last
year showed that a majority of
the students were in favor of
such a plan.

Dr. Roy Heath, Director of the
University Counseling Service, has
agreed to meet with two repre-
sentatives from MC to make out
a suitable list of prospective pro-
fessors.

The Council also appointed
members to the Human Relations
Board and to the Foreign Stu-
dents Programming Committee.

In order to further “intclie.c- M
tualism in the dormitories,”
Steve Johnson, MC President
alsoadvocated placing copies of
the New York Times in every
men’s lounge.

Plans for a weekly calendar of
men’s activities to be distributed

to all dorms will be discussed at

the next meeting which will be
held Thursday at 7 p.m. in 319
Schenley Hall,

 

  

9 The four ministers, who will

rotate their presentations of serv-
ices, are: Dr. Charles Carlson, ad-
visor too the Lutheran Students’
Union; Dr. 3. Stanley Barlow, ad-
visor to the Westminster Founda-
tion; Dr. Paul L. Offenheiser, di-
rector of the Baptist Students’
Headquarters of Western Penn-
sylvania, and Dr. Paul Schreid-
ing, advisor of the Wesleyan As-
sociation.. I

The Heinz Chapel services are
conducted particularly for stu-
dents but are also open to all
other University members who
wish to attend.

A The Heinz Chapel Choir will
sing at all regular services and
at the special Thanksgiving and
Christmas presentations.

In addition to the Protestant
services there will be regular
Masses held by the Roman Cath-

olic Oratory in Heinz Chapel
every Sunday at 10 a.m., and
Monday, Thursday, Friday, and

Saturday at noon. L
The Oratory will also conduct
classes open to all students en-
rolled in the University. The
classes'a1'e scheduled for Sundays,
Mondays, Tuesdays and Thurs-
days at 8 p.m. in Cardinal New-
man Hall. 1 »

Rabbi Richard Rubcnstcin will
present a series of discussions on
religion for Jewish students.
These discussions will be held in
the Supper Room every Tuesday
at noon.

Although the services and dis-
cussions are held primarily for
students, ‘they are open to all
members of the University.

Lawrence Lee, professor of En-

glish, will open the Book Center’si

p.m. in the Fine Books Room of
the Book Center. He will discuss

“To Kill A Mockingbird” by

Time ScheduleLists
VVinter Instructors

Identification Before Registration
Time schedules ‘for the winter trimester, including names -

able‘ next month in time for registration on Oct. 16," an-
nounced Albert B. Martin, dean of the School of Liberal Arts.

He explained that earlier. time schedules did not state .

for 80 Per Cent

of the classes, will be avail-

hour because the IBM com-

printer’s proofs of the time sched-
ule did not have the capacity to
include the instructors’ names.

Another IBM machine was sub-
stituted as soon as possible and
recent time schedules have in-
cluded the names of instructors in
many time slots, according to
Martin. '

Instructors Listed

“I have instructed the various
departments to inform us of their
course assignments in time for in-
clusion in the winter schedule.

“Except for multiple section
courses and those taught by part-
time instructors, the names of in-
structors will be listed in the cor-
rect time slots. I .am shooting for
80 per cent identification,” Martin
added. I

“The new schedule will also
prevent incidents such as the log
jam which developed when stu-
dents who wanted to change to
courses taught by the four newly
appointed Mellon professors tried
to see their advisors,” he ex-
plained.

Students Reluctant

(Last Wednesday the Dean’s of-
ﬁce announced that undergradu-
ates who wished to take courses
taught by the four new Mellon
professors could transfer to those
courses without being charged
late fees. The professors were ap-
pointed after registration took
place.)

Students waited to see their
advisors to schedule the change
and many of them never reach-
ed the LA office to pick up class
cards.

“There hasn’t been a gold rush
here,” Martin said. “Most stu-
dents are reluctant at this late
date to change their courses. Reg-
istration in October should .be

smoother than this fall’s.’’

SANE Chapter
Resolution Urges

Full Disarmament

The University chapter of the
Students’ Committee for a Sane
Nuclear Policy met on .Monday
and issued a resolution urging
‘A’. . . that the Government of the
United States seriously consider
.. . . the Soviet proposals for total
disarmament with full inspection
and "control.

“As recent events have shown
 . nuclear test ban talks and

even a successful nuclear test ban

treaty, alone cannot avert the
threat of atomic war.” '

In a letter to Pittsburgh’s Con-
gressmen, the group demanded
the passage, of an act now before
the. House which“ would permit
the creation of an Arms Control
and Disarmament Commission.
‘Sane proposed that the Commis-
sion possess the authority and
means for inclepedent work on
disarmament problems.

While the students protest that
the Commission should be inde-
pendent of the State Department,

they favor a policy of reporting.

‘ﬁndings to the Department and
the President.

THE GIRL I LEFTBEHIND ME

It happens every day. A young man goes off to college, leaving 1
his home town sweetheart with vows of eternal love, and then
he ﬁnds that he has outgrown her. What, in such cases, is the
honorable thing to do?

Well sir, you can do what Rock Sigafoos did.

VVhen Rock left Cut and Shoot, Pa., he said to his sweetheart,

a simple‘ country lass named Tess d’ Urbevilles, .“‘My dear,

though I am far away in college, ‘I will love you always. I will
never look at another girl. If I do, may my eyeballs parch and
wither, may my viscera writhe like adders, may the moths get
my new tweed jacket !’?

Then he clutched Tess to his bosom and planted a ﬁnal kiss
upon her fragrant -young skull and went away, meaning with all
his heart to be faithful. A

But on the very first day of college he met a coed named
Fats. Morgana, a girl of _ such sophistication, such poise, such

. uwoir-faire as Rock had never beheld. She spoke knowingly of

Franz Kafka, she bummed Mozart, she smoked Marlborol.

    

aw

Now, Rock didn’t know Franz Kafka. from Pancho Villa, or
l\«.lozart from James K. Polk, but Marlboros he knew full well.
He knew that anyone .who smoked Mai-lboros was modern and
advanced and as studded with brains as a ham with cloves.
Good sense tells you that you can’t beat Ma.rlboro’s exclusive
selectrate ﬁlter, and you never could beat Marlboro’s ﬁne ﬂavor.‘
This Rock knew.

So all day he followed Fata around campus and listened to her
talk about Franz Kafka, and then in the evening he went back

 

to the dormitory and found this letter from his home town‘

sweetheart Tess:

Dear Rock,

Us kids had a keen time yesterday. We went down fo the
pond and caught some frogs. I caught the most of anybody.
’]‘hen we hitcrh.ed rides on trunks and did lots of nutsy stuﬁ
like that. Well, I must close now because I got to whitewash
the fence.

Your friend,

1 ' Tess
PS.-——I can do my Hula Hoop 3,000, times.

‘Veil sir, Rock thought about Tess and then he thought
about Fata and then a great sadness fell upon him. Suddenly
he knew he had outgrown young,~innocent Tess; his heart now
belonged tosmart, sophisticated Fata.

Rock, being above all things honorable, returned forthwith
to his home town and walked up to Tess and looked her in the
eye and said manlily, ‘-‘I do not love you any more. I love 8
girl named Fata Morgana. You can hit me in the stomach with
all your might if you like.”

‘‘That’s okay, hey,” said Tess amiably. .“I don't love you
neither. I found a new boy.”

.“/What is his name?” asked Rock.

.‘‘Franz Kafka,” said Tess.

“A splendid fellow,” said Rock and shook Tess’s hand, and
they have remained good friends to this day. In fact, Rock and
Fata often double—date with Franz and Tess and have heaps of
fun. Franz can do the Hula Hoop 6,000 times.

  Tlie Chapel Clmnge  

Heinz Chapel has been on campus since 1934’, and re-
ligious organizations were not long to follow. At last, the
two have united to answer the religious needs of University

students. .
Religion’s place on campus, especially at a secular uni-
versity such as Pitt, will always cause some raised eye-
brows andiproduce many skeptics. Yet with the number of
-dorm students increasing each year, the University has a
deﬁnite responsibility to its members. a
If~the*University is to be ‘considered a community" in
itself, it must provide those things necessary to any com-
munity. This week, another milestone has been reached in
this often—forgotten area. i 5
_ Realizing its basic spiritual obligation long ago, the
University constructed Heinz Chapel for those who would
use it,’but few formal programs were offered. In its attempt

to become an object of religious identiﬁcation. In many
cases it was referred to only as a showpiece for University
visitors, comparable to the mysterious Syria Lebanon inter-
national room. A
Except for Tuesday services, few students took advan-
“ tage of the solitude offered inside those heavy doors. Stu-
dents desiring some religious» inspiration found it in the
organizations of their particular denomination without fur-
their thought to the Chapel. -
Furthermore, much of the work which should have
been done by the University chaplain was taken over by
-‘individual organization advisors, A further ’ divorcing the
Chapeland its services from the student.

to conduct Tuesday services as well as the pro‘v:?.sion for four
Roman Catholic Oratorians to celebrate Masses in the
Chapel has ﬁnally combined the two forces. ‘ '
Although it has remained 'interdenomin,ational, the
' Chapel is no longer religiously anonymous. Five religions,
atlleast, will now be able to draw upon one of the most
‘beautiful facilities on campus and use it in that area most
needed in the world today. A

Death Of A ‘Symbol

By Nathan Firestone

Dag Hammarskjolds death must «be regarded
as a_ personal tragedy by everyone who observes
the Soviet Union fanning out the unsteady ﬂame
of peace remaining in the worldtoday.

Hammarskjold was, as Adlai Stevenson; eulo-
gized-him, “a soldier of peace — one of the great-
est of our age)’, The Secretary-
General was completely dedicat-=‘
ed to his job, and :carried out his V
duties with a vigor that gave the

But as tragic as the loss of
this man is, even -sadder is the
demise of the symbol that was
carried. to -its violent _ end in

For more than any other
person, Dag Hamrnarskjold bod- ,

ied the ideals of the United Nations Charter. He

symbolized the strength and integrityiof the United M

Nations in the face of a Soviet attack calculated

to reduce it to nothing more than a gloriﬁed prop-

aganda outlet.
Wecikened Resistance

With the death of the Secretary-General, re-
sistance to the Soviet “troika” plan will soon

.-

weaken among uncommitted nations. For no man «

could ever be as closely identiﬁed with the office
of Secretary—General as was Hammarskjold. As
long as the Swedish diplomat lived, Soviet‘-plans
to revamp the Secretariat were directed against a

living, vital institution. With his death, the attack

lost its personal character.

‘This tragedy now gives Russia a perfect oppor-
tunity to stalemate the United Nations permanent-
ly. It can simp1y_refuse to accept any possible suc-
cessor to the post, and instead press for the three-
man Secretariat.

"Russia will no longer be faced with the prob-
lem of a United Nations police forcerestoring sta-

bility to an area as it did in the Congo and in the

The fact that Hammarskjold was able to ac-

complish nothing in Hungary did not diminish his '

imageas much as it lessened the picture of West-

But some will say that since the “troika” pro-u I

Soviet Union will be forced to abandon it.

Wasn’t the Soviet decision. to resume nuclear 

testing evidence enough of-what Mr. Khrushchev
thinks of world opinion? Every protest so far has
been answered by a mushroom cloud rising from
somewhere in Central Asia.

There is. no if point in kidding ourselves. The
U.S.S.R. simply does not give a damn about world
opinion if it feels a straight power play will have

I must be willing to listen at-

Carlos Romulo
Initiates New

Midday Series

Ex UN President
To Discuss U.S.

«Stake in Asia

The president of the Fourth
General Assembly of the United
Nations, Gen. Carlos P. Romulo,
will initiate the ﬁrst fall Midday
Series program on Wednesday,
at .noon, in the SU Ballroom.

Gen. Romulo, who also served

I as president of the UN Security

Council, will lecture on “Amer-
ica’s Stake in Asia.” Called “a
spellbinding voice that is a potent
influence in contemporary his-
tory,” the Philippine ambassador
to the United States, Cuba, and
Brazil, is attempting to improve
American-Asian relations.

A statesman, author, and
soldier, Romulo holds 36 honorary

degrees from European, Asian, and

American universities. He has
written nine best-selling books,

among them, “I Saw the Fall of

the Philippines,” “My Brother
Americans,” and “The Magsaysay
Story.” In 1942, he won the Pul-
itzer Prize in journalism for dis-
tinguished correspondence.
During World War II, Romulo

rose from Major to Brigadier,

General while serving as General
Douglas MacArthur’s aide-de-
camp on Bataan, Corregidor, and
the South Paciﬁc. He accompanied
General MacArthur in the in-
vasion of Leyte, and later, in the
momentous recapture of ‘ Manila.

An informal coffee hour‘ will be
held at 3 p.m. in the SU Lounge.
General Romulo will answer ques-
tions from the students -and fac-
ulty related to his lecture and
world affairs.

Series of Lectures

Frank S. Meyer,‘ lecturer, .and
member of the editorial board of
National Review Magazine, was
unable to open the Society for
. Conservative Studies lecture Ser-
ies on Thursday, as planned, in
the SU Supper Room.

Meyer’s topic was to have been
“The Challenge of Conservatism.”

Educated at Princeton, Oxford,
the Universities of Chicago and
London, ’Meyer was, for many
years, theorist for the American
Communist Party. He abandoned
the Red movement in 1945 and

has since become influential in
the development of American
Conservatism.

Meyer was unable to appear
due to transportation difficulties
arising from Hurricane Esther,
and also due to his wife’s serious
illness. _

The society is attempting to re-
schedule the lecture for the ﬁrst
week in October.

Current plans call for F. A.
Hayek to appear in the lecture
-series October 26. Dr. Robert
Strauss-Hupe has agreed to ap-
pear late in November. He is di-
rector of the Institute for Foreign
Policy Research at the University
of Pennsylvania.

John Des Passes, author of
“U.S.A.: A Trilogy,” “Midcentury,”

According to the colorful bro-
chure’ of the Pitt football team,
Saturday was an open date on the
gridiron calendar, but according to
the players who were supposed to
be slouched in’ armchairs, enjoy-
ing the comfort of an off-day,

they played their “roughest game

of the y ar.” V -
Coach John Michelosen con-

ducted a heavy-duty scrimmage

session that was the match of the
Miami opener for resounding con-
tact work. Michelosen has learned
from bad experience, however, not
to have his “A” unit duel with
the “B” unit. »

Last year the Panthers lost
more “ players in intra-squad

games than they did during the"

regular campaign. “Everybody is
ﬁghting for ‘a position,” said
Halfback Bob Clemens yesterday.
“And the guys on the ﬁrst team

know they can go full blast be-

cause there will be a good guy to
take his place.”
“We have depth. Maybe not

certainly more than last year.
That's what hurt us last sea-
son. Our ﬁrst team was strong,”
Clemens remarked‘, “but we had
no depth.” »

The newcomers, especially
Quarterback Paul ‘ Martha and
Fullback Rick Leeson have made
a vast difference. “They like to

Prepare For

Coach Bill Kaliden’s fresh-
g_men footballers are working

opening contest. at Kent State
on October 5, only ten days
‘away. The game will be
played under the lights. _

Other teams on the Cubs four
game schedule are West Virginia,
‘Penn State and Navy. All games,
with the exception of the battle
with the little Mountaineers, will
be played on the opposition’s
home grounds.

‘ Last year the Frosh won all of
their games and Kaliden is hop-

ing for a repeat of that perform-

ance. One thing that might stand
in the way of a good season is
that chronic worry of all coaches,
lack of depth.
Backﬁeld Thin
At last count the Cubs had four

.men each at end and tackle, six

guards and two centers on the
line. The backﬁeld is where the
depth problem really begins to
show. There are only two quar-
terbacks, ﬁve halfbacks and three
fullbacks.
The problem will be remedied
by “having some players double
up in positions,” according to

f Kaliden.

The team is lighter than last
year’s squad, especially in the
-line. The weight range goes from
Jock Beachler’s 178 to Bernie
Hynde’s 247. However, the rough
grind is taking its toll on the be-
hemoth tackle who has already

lost 13 pounds since practice be-

gan. Beachler is hoping that he
can dig upsome Hynde’s “excess
baggage.”

In fact, the boys from Maryland
very nearly pulled it out in the
two ﬁve-minute overtime periods.

Leo Bemis’ booters, hampered
by minor injuries, went with two
unexpected starters. Ted Verlato

Frostburg Frustrates
Panthers In Opener, 1 - 1

By ED HOWARD
The ﬁnal score .in Saturday’s‘ soccer game was Pitt 1,
Frostburg 1, but there were two very diﬁerent games played

The Panthers scored one goal“in the ﬁrst half and barely
missed ﬁve or six others, completely dominating play in the
ﬁrst two quarters. But Frostburg State, Teachers’ College

managed to withstand the on-9

steam. Frostbung, ‘with a defen-
sive line that looked as big as
Syracusefs “Sizeable Seven” of
1959, missed several good scoring
opportunities before knotting the
score at 20:25 of the third quar-
ter.

Bill Henagan went right down
the middle and blasted the ball
into the net from about thirty
feet out.

“We have a lot of jelling to
do,” «Bemis, lamented after the
game. “Therejare a few holes‘ to

be done.” The hard ground at the

contender is pressing for the jobi

in earnest.

Jim Traficant, who held the,‘

position in the pre-season train-
ing camp before he was injured,
is out on the turf again sans his
crutches. Traficant is still far from
top-shape, but he is trying hard
to make the date.

Traficant and Pitt will have 3 1 “

week to prepare for Baylor, a
team which is given a good
chance to win the Southwest
Conference. “I have been told
by everybody that Baylor has
one of the best backﬁelds in the
country,” Michelosen s t a t e s.
“Tremendous speed, excellent
passing. I just hope we can
keep them from scoring too
much.”
Only time will tell. Or will it be
the pass defense that will tell?

“Strangler” Wagner

Had John Huber Wagner spent’ his undergraduate days in the
hamlet of New Haven, Connecticut,’ and played football under the
auspices of the old’ Eli of Yale, he would have been an All-American
end in 1913.

“Hube,” however, entered the University ‘of Pittsburgh, sans
fanfare in 1910. But when he graduated from the medical school
with honors some years later, he was heralded as the greatest end
ever to don the blue and gold uniform.

Unfortunately, Walter Camp, the ‘self-professed expert on All-
Americans, never focused his rose-colored binoculars west of the
Appalachian Mountains, and “Hube” was snubbed. A bonaﬁde All-
America candidate in those days had to have his name in the blue
book and part his cognomen in the middle.

Dr. Wagner’s hair was a shimmering white, and the
keen eyes “Which never lost sight of the ball” were framed by
gold-rimmed glasses, as he stood at the podium in the Hotel
Webster Hall on Thursday night. _

The occasion was a testimonial dinner saluting Dr. Wagner as
the Sportsman of the Year 1961, sponsored by the Allegheny County
 it - Civic Sportsmen’s Association.

 

still a menacing-looking character.

Dr. William D. McClelland, the
chairman of the County Commis-
sioners and a Pitt back long ago,
referred to Dr. Wagner as “the
Fritzi Zivic of football.”
‘ Zivic‘ was a local pugilist, a
champion at that, who thought
that the Marquis of Queensbury
rules were merely recipes for
cakes and pies.

“Hube” ldidn’t butt anyone
with his forehead, or twist his
thumb in their eye, but Pete
Mauthe, a gridiron Hall of
Famer from Penn State, told the
gathering, “He was the first
red-dogger that I know of.

I When this guy got on your neck, he was alway on your back when

you went down. 7

Then —- he’d always give you a little push — into the mud -
to rub the ‘hide off your face.” After reading the yellowed newspapers
that carried his notorious episodes, I would say that he was more
akin to Ed Lewis, the king of wrestling before it fell into its fairy-
tale scheme of things. _

Lewis perfected his headlock, called a “strangle hold” by many,
and he became known as “Strangler Lewis.” This stage name would
have been just as appropriate for the Monaca lad. Wagner was hotly
criticized for his aversion to tackling anyone lower than the neck.

Since helmets were little more than worn-out slippers strung
over the ears in those days, he was probably the most §an€ tackle!‘
in the sport. When asked why this was his modus operandi, Dr.
Wagner smiled, “Cause I didn’t want to get kicked in the head!” .

Wagner, himself, was once caught in the act of attempting
to beat a tattoo with his feet on the cranium of a prostrate Buck-
nell player. “Hube” also pummeled into guys making fail‘ catches.
and was often accused of “unnecessary roughness.”

Recalling what Mauthe said about him, Wagner remarked, “He
was a good fullback — but he went down when I hit him. Maybe
I was a smart aleck or something, but I always liked to go oomph.”
He feinted with a stiff, outstretched hand. “I lpved to bury their
heads into the goo.”

His strong hands. which once held boa-constrictor-like grips
on enemy windpipes, later became the tools that made Dr. VVagner
one of the city’s best physicians.

When “Hube” was in Pitt’s medical school, he used to cut prac-
tice rather than cut classes. “I am inthe University of Pittsburgh to
get an education,” he said. “I have to have it, but I don’t have to
play football. Sport is not the sole end and. aim of my life. I W111
play as hard for the school as I know how, but I\must stud)’ first
and play afterwards.”

“Afterwards” he was an All-American. Roll over Walter Camp.

Carl Rees, “we would have

the conclusion of Saturday’s en-
counter. The only cluster of Pitt
runners was at the rear of the
pack.

Shirey highlighted the Rockets’
victory as he broke the rough 4.1
mile Slippery Rock course record
with a sparkling 21:19 effort. I-leg
romped home 45 seconds ahead of
his teammate, Gioiosa, who placed
second. Lucas, also representing
Slippery Rock, gave the winners
a 1-2-3 sweep by ﬁnishing 45. sec-
onds later.

Waslo Leads Pitt

Steve Waslo led the Pitt run-
ners with a fourth-place ﬁnish in
exactly 23:00. Larry Robinson was
ﬁfth in 23:18. Referring to sopho-
mores Waslo and Robinson, Rees
said, “They ran pretty well, but I
expect them to do even better.”
