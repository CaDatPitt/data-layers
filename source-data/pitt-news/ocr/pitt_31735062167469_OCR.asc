  SG President Exposes

 

Gap In Communications

The Pitt News recently
learned of a communication
gap between the administra-
tion and Student Government.
Ken Schueler, SG president,
in a letter sent to the Chancel-
lor last Monday, outlined his grie-
vances with the administration
concerning the Book Center Com-
mittee.

Chancellor Posvar requested
that Schueler “appoint three stu-
dent representatives as members
of an ad hoc committee to review
the operation of the Book Center

9 UCR Holds Seventh Meeting
Sees ‘Tiny Bits of Progress’

‘gag.

by VIRGINIA JOYCE

The group could have been par-
ents planning a church picnic or
PTA members holding their an-
nual car wash. But the 32 men
and 10 Women were faculty mem-
bers of the University. The scene

_ was the Fine Arts Building for the

seventh meeting of the Universi-
ty Committee on Racism (UCR)
Monday night.

As has been the plan for the last
three meetings, a general progress
report was heard first. Then, those
present broke up into five task
forces to discuss the assigned
problems.

Each of the task force chairmen
offered a brief resumee of his
committee’s efforts. The first to
speak was James Hileman. He

apologized for the “tiny little bits.

of progress. Some progress is be-
ing made on the labor pool. But
we’re having trouble in getting
applicants.”

Dr. Henry Finck leveled a cri-
ticism against the campus police.
“They’re essentially rejects from
other police forces,” he complain-
ed. “Discussion is needed on their
recruitment and training, and es-
pecially the way they dress.”

Dr. Finck was the originator of
the UCR movement. He presented
a petition before the Faculty Sen-
ate a few months ago, citing the
University as being “racist.” As
a result, interested faculty mem-
bers banded together to form the
UCR. Dr. Finck is a deeply bronz-
ed man who gained the immedi-
ate attention of his peers when he
spoke.

The secretary of the UCR spoke
up next. Dr. Robert H. Gibson
lowered his feet. clad in holey
tennis shoes. from the back of the
seat in front of him and stood up.

“I want to add that now we
have upwards of 90 names of in-
terested people,” he said. “Some
refuse to come to the general
meetings on the grounds that most
of the work is accomplished in
outside workshops.”

Several o t h e r reforms w e r e
cited. Committee members report-
ed on the set—up of Reading Labs
and training films for faculty
members. A series of sessions with
the Dean?’s Council is in the plan-

".¢

faculty members split up into
their respective task forces, with
one member of the Black Action
Society (BAS) accompanying
each.

The committee meetings fol-
lowed the same tone as the gen-
eral one. The Committee on Uni-
versity Involvement with the
Community, for example, was an
informal, forum-type of discussion
group. All there were on a first
name basis which fostered the at-
mosphere of healthy discussion.
The BAS representative partici-
pated actively and with a friend-
ly, cooperative attitude.

Before the start of the general
meeting, four faculty members of
varying backgrounds commented
on the UCR movement.

Dr. Robert Baldwin, Founda-
tions of Education, confessed that

he was “very passimistic about
the possible success of the UCR’
There is a complex series of in-
terlocking problems. The pres-
sures of University life make peo-
ple unwilling to make a commit-
ment.”

A major accomplishment, ex-
plained the red head, will be “to
overcome ignorance in the area
(of race relations), especially my
own.”

James Cunningham, an initia-
tor of the UCR and chairman of
the general meeting, was more
optimistic. “Changes have al-
ready-been brought about in de-
partments, schools and the Uni-
versity as a whole,” be outlined.
“Members of UCR are pushing a
step-up of black students, money
and black faculty members.”

Paintings In Majority

were Jean Mangan, Ken Holecko,
and Schueler himself. Following
the appointments, SG never re-
ceived a confirmation of the per-
sons selected nor of any possible
meetings of the committee.

“I am interested to know wheth-
er any action has been taken on
setting up the Book Center Com-
mittee for this summer,” Schueler
inquired in a letter sent to Dr.
Posvar on June 6.

The Chancellor sent a reply the
next day, confirming the selection
of the committee members, and
stating that David Smith, treas-
urer of the University, w o u l d
serve as chairman of the commit-
tee.

Between June 7 and July 8 -
despite inquiries — there was no
further communication from the
Chancellor’s office.

On July 8, Smith informed the
SG president that no meaningful
discussion by the committee could
be held at that time without the

financial report of the Book Cen-
ter, which would not be available
until the first week of August.

This past Monday, Schueler
was informed that the Book Cen-
ter Committee would meet on
August 8. In a conversation with
Smith on that same day, the SG
president ‘reached “a number of
disturbing conclusions.”

Schueler surmised that there
were two financial considerations
that influenced the behavior of
the administration during the past
two months. First, that the finan-
cial figures of the Book Center’s
operation for the year would not
be available until the first week
in August. Mr. Smith felt that the
committee would not be in a posi-
tion to accurately evaluate a re-
vision of the 10 per cent student
discount without this information.

“Second,” stated Schueler, “it I I

would have been a financial im-
possibility to make any price

DA’s Men Close .
‘Theresa, Isabelle’

Therese and Isabelle, a French
film, was closed on July 19 by
District Attorney Robert Duggan
and his men on the grounds that
the movie was obscene. Dr. Jay
E. Daily, chairman of the Perma-
nent Associaton for Intellectual
Resources (PAIR), has strongly
objected to this censorship.

Dr. Daily argues that Therese
and Isabelle was not excluded by
Customs Regulation 305, dealing
with obscene material. Adequate
legal review of the movie had al-
ready taken place and it was giv-
en passage by US Customs and it
is not for a local group to decide
that the film is obscene.”

The PAIR uses the Supreme
Court to prove the validity of its
second objection. “The US Su-
preme Court has defined ‘obscen-
ity’ in several decisivns US vs.
Roth, Potomac News vs. Day, and
Redrup vsj New York. The result
was that only material of the
crudest sort may be called ob-

scene, such as comic books of
‘Jiggs and Maggie’ type, graphic
representations of intercourse
with emphasis on the sex organs,
and the like. To be obscene, a
work must be wholly lacking of

redeeming social or literary mer- ’

it.”
Dr. Day said, “The evident ob-
ject of the movie is to show the

transitory nature of homosexual‘

activities among school girls, and
to put the subject in proper per-
spective, which is always a
healthy thing to do. React of
fright, and attempts at censorship,
destroy the perspective so essen-
tial to the subject, and thus are
far more dangerous than the film
ever could be.”

Th e organization (PAIR) is
comprised of graduate school and
faculty members of the School of
Library Science. They will attend
the hearing at the Common Pleas
Court July 30.

East Liberty Holding Own Art Festival

by RISE WEINBERG

East Liberty is holding its own
Arts Festival from now until‘July
28. Displays are set up on the
Broad Street Mall.

In many ways this Festival re-
sembles the Three Rivers Arts
Festival. It has the usual number
of art works which are either the
same thing every amateur does or

. too weird for even an art expert

to figure out. Like Three Rivers,
it also has many examples of true
creativity.

3 Paintings compose the largest
part of the Festival. Styles vary
from realistic. to abstract. to sur-
realistic, to impressionistic. One
of the better paintings is of a de-
lapidated building by Griffin.
The artist concentrated his efforts
on small details and the use of
greys. Special techniques craw
the viewer into the painting.
Light plays a barge role in creat-
ing depth. The artist leaves you
to ponder the question of why
is there a colorful comic book in
the picture of a grey deserted
building&

Another excellent painting is of
a seated boy by Wargo. The only
bright color is red in the chair.

er ’.Rre., Jew --and, or 

duce the intense effect of th e
painting. Visibly, h e a v y brush-
strokes add to the comtemplative
aspects. The boy appears too large
for the work. He seems ready to
jump out of the painting at you.

Several of the paintings use
wood instead of paint. One of
these is an abstract of a person by
Somerville. Small pieces of wood
in different directions and height
create an aerial view of a person
sitting tailor fashion. The shapes
are large and curved. The curves
add softness to the painting.

Another example of an imagina-
tive use of wood is in a work by
Ruth Poritz. The wood serves as
the canvas, and carved lines are
ink. The subject of this work is a
person lying onhis stomach.
Depth is added by using serveral
lines as the outline of limbs. Also
large shapes appear to be at the
front of the canvas while smaller
shapes seem to be in the back-
ground. It is interesting that the
hands are massive and in the fore-
ground, while the eyes are small
and closely-set.

Many of the artists use their
works as a mediums of social cri-
ticism. One of these, by Pearson,
is, shout...-.. the. rasial

who cowers behind her. She is
like any other mother in her de-
sire to protect her child from
harm. But the things which threat-
en to harm her child are much
greater than average obstacles.
The artist makes the situation un-
complicated by using simple
shapes and few colors. There is
no use of shading, only large
masses of color.

Unfortunately, the Festival con-
tains little sculpture. Most of the
sculpture presented is m eta l .
Some of this is quite imaginative.
Americo Coloazzi entered several
works with a touch of humor. One
of these was a metal sculpture of
a warrior—god entitled “The Boss.”
It shows an excellent employment
of small metal scrapes to create
something entirely unrelated to
its medium.

Duggan?

In the United States, the concept of freedom is, to say the
least, a cherished value. This nation fights a senseless war in
Vietnam to protect the “freedom” of the South Vietnamese
people. We are appalled by the lack of freedom in the Com-
munist world, and shocked by the totalitarianism and atroc-
ity that emanated from Hitler’s Third Reich.

The United States Constitution grants the citizenry the
rights of freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, freedom of
press, and freedom of choice. It must be admitted, however,
that these collective freedoms are somewhat vague in their
applications. Even so, the recent closing of the Guild Thea-
tre by District Attorney Robert Duggan represents a travesty
of our freedom of choice. A number of faculty and graduate
students in the School of Library Science have protested the
District Attorney’s action by rightfully forming the Perma-
nent Association for Intellectual Resources (PAIR).

The controversy stems from the Pittsburgh showing of
the movie Therese and Isabelle at the Guild Theatre. Dis-
trict Attorney Duggan closed the theatre and maintained that
the film was contaminating the minds of our young people. He
and a committee of citizens and clergy decided that the film
was pornographic. It was on this basis that Duggan closed
the theatre.

The PAIR “strongly objects to the recent closing of
Therese and Isabelle.” PAIR Chairman Dr. Jay E. Daily, an
ed from France, “passed the standards of US Customs office
dealing with obscene material. Given passage by US Cus-
toms,” says Dr. Daily, “it is not for a local group to decide
that the film is obscene.”

But Dr. Daily’s strong objection to the District Attor-
ney’s recent action goes beyond the mere citation of US Cus-
toms regulations; he delves into the Supreme Court’s recent
decisions concerning obscenity. He points out that only such
“things as comic books of the ‘Jiggs and Maggie’ type and
graphic representations of intercourse with an emphasis on
the sexual organs” are considered pornographic by the Su-
preme Court. “To be obscene,” says Dr. Daily, “a work must
be wholly lacking redeeming social or literary merit.”

Therese and Isabelle was reviewed in the current issue
of Playboy Magazine. “The story of her (Therese’s) love af-
fair is unfolded in graceful flashbacks,” according to the re-
view. The Playboy article depicted the girls “Lesbianism as
intense, but essentially innocent.” The perspective that Play-
by paints hardly seems pornographic. In fact, Playboy im-
plicitly maintains that Therese and Isabelle is a contem-
porary film with social value.

This brings us to the crux of the matter—the right of Dis-
trict Attorney Duggan to close down a theatre that happens
to be showing a movie that has passed all the obscenity stan-
dards set up by the United States Customs Office. Can Dis-
trict Attorney Duggan and a small group of “concerned citi-
zens and clergy” rightfully prevent citizens from seeing a
movie that has some degree of social value? Does this small
but “morally annointed” group have the right to speak for the
whole community? What right does any group have in tell-
ing any citizen what movies he should or should not see?

The Pitt News believes that District Attorney Duggan’s
action has violated the fundamental right of freedom of
the American system. As Dr. Daily points out, the film in
question has not violated any laws. And -Playboy points out
that the film does, in fact, have social and artistic value. Thus
Duggan’s very unprofessional assertions are without factual
support.

With this logical basis, The Pitt News finds it difficult
to understand the motivation behind Duggan’s actions at the
Guild. Perhaps Duggan is using this foggy issue for some
political matter. But we must remind Mr. Duggan that
Adolph Hitler used censorship to politically strengthen his
regime.

We certainly hope that Duggan is not given the right to

unwittingly establish the Fourth Reich in the Pittsburgh area.

 

 

 

 

 
 

From The End Of The Bar —'

Faces Of War . . .They’re The
Kids From Around The Block

by GEORGE LIES
Associate Editor

The revolution is coming, friend.

So, count me in. Let’s support it robustly: let’s
get started before it’s too late.

And friend, before you start, know who your
comrades are; you should never forget their faces.

FOR THEY ARE the same faces you knew as a
teenager; the faces you grew up knowing. They are
the same faces you stood up to and argued with,
fought with, became pals with, and the same one
you thought you never would understand.

That is, until now; the revolution and the final
takeover is brewing.

And friend, don’t forget what we will be fight-
ing for. Don’t forget whose honor we will be de-
fending; all those faces just like you are young and
impatient.

There’s Gary. Johnny. Susie, Jimmy, Terry.
Marianne. Carol. J. J.. Bob. and Bernie. They’ve all
played a part in our struggle already.

GARY WENT TO war not long ago. He went
with Bernie. He went and fought and died. He
fought and never really knew why; he just fought
for a flag and died. Bernie came back, but don't
bother him with questions about what happened.
He’s seen it, but count him out when it comes to
telling glorious war stories.

Johnny and Bob went to college. They were
caught-up in that fantasy world for a while. Then
Bob met Susie and Johnny worried about the draft
call. Bob and Susie’s story has been heard before:
they had to get married. Johnny’s story is still a hot
issue; another intervention upon liberty he feels.

 

 How Our Readers See It . . .

 Student Mlsupurns ‘Racism’

Editor, The Pitt News

I am a highischool student, F3098-

Terry sports a well-cut beard now. Last week he
burned his draft card in a church demonstration:
right before a priest. too. along with 20 others. Fun-
ny thing about him. though. You’ll never meet a
more loyal friend, nor a better patriot.

MARIANNE MUST struggle. She has always
been held to the restrictions of leading a Catholic
life, and right now, she is at the peak of frustra-
tion and confusion. She looks at the Church and ex-
pects something great of it; but then it betrays her
with new ideologies. It doesn’t let her exploit the
“me” in her.

Carol works as a secretary. She’s 21, and swears
she’s out to have a good time while she’s young.
But inside, she’s looking for security, a family, and
one of the better qualities of America, a home.

J. J. was in trouble with the law. He was placed
on two years probation; naturally, he wasn’t drafted.
But now he must live with a black mark against
him; live with it and grab hold of any job he can.

Skip has a good job, and dates a fine girl who
he plans to marry. He’s a nice guy. He doesn’t plan
to light a fire under the world; he just wants to be
left to himself. He’s just a nice guy.

ALL THE FACES are different. They’re young
and they’re anxiously waiting to see if it will be
worth living in this country after the older set gets
through with it.

Yet with all their social problems and adjust-
ment problems, they will attempt to live here. They
know it will become their turn to command; as
their parents tried to do before them.

And after the revolution; after the coup, they
may again yearn to sing of their country, the land
of their birth

 

 

would most likely overlook these
things and bring in more white
professors, more white administra-
tors, and more white students.

If this isn’t racism, then what

currently attending Pitt under
the Project‘ Upward,Bound. I am
writing in regards to the letter
by Miss Barbara Sargent (Pitt
News, Fri. July 12).

She tried to point out that
the Black Action Society (BAS)
is just another racist group. I do
not believe this. Miss Sargent
gives a one-sided view.

There are, however, a few good
points. One in particular is that
Miss Sargent said “that there is
no such thing as white or black,
or yellow, or red racism; there
is merely racism.”

I agree to a certain extent, but

of all the racist attitudes, white
racism is predominate. But I
think this only natural because

The writer also got confused on
another issue. She said that if
the BAS picked out all the pro-
fessors, demanding them to be
black, and if the BAS wanted
black administrators and more
black students, this would be
racism on the part of the BAS.

I feel that Miss Sargent did
not consider the fact that if the
BAS never demanded these few
things, the present administration

is?

Is" there anything wrong with
trying to bring down the white
racist stature of Pitt and just be-
cause the BAS tries. Miss Sar-
gent branded them as “just an-
other racist group.”

I think she needs to read be-
tween the lines before she says
this. ‘

premise seems based on a wide-
spread misconception of the true
reason for the study of a foreign
language.

Actually, proficiency in a lan-
guage after even four years of
college study often is question-
able, and even some of those in-

dividuals who subsequently do
travel abroad may not always be
able to express themselves as ade-
quately as they might wish.

Rather, the main argument in
favor of foreign language study
is that a person, in studying a
foreign language, is forced to
analyze his own native language,
and thus to learn it better than
most persons can manage in
courses of their native language.
English in our case. In other
words. thd study of a foreign
language necessarily leads to a
better understanding of one’s
own.

While English courses could
provide the same service. most
fail to do so through no fault of
their own, simply because the
student feels that he is made to
study something which he already
knows. The foreign language then
provides the required “leverage."

A secondary reason for lan-
guage study is. or should be, the
mental discipline which is deriv-
ed from it.

During the past two months. no
student w a s ever informed of
these two assumptions or their im-

committee would not be in a posi-
tion to make any decision on the
discount policy for the Fall. 1968.
The simple truth of the matter is
that the decision had been made
by the University. without the
Book Center Committee. to con-
tinue its present policies through
the upcoming school year.

Schueler also wondered why
the committee could not have met
in June or July to discuss Book
Center policies other than the 10
per cent discount.
