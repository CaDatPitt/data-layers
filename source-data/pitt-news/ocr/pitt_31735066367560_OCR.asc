Fraternities Set
Cancer Crusade

Seventeen fraternities at the
University of Pittsburgh will pro-
vide “Collegiate Crusaders” for the
American Cancer Society’s edu-
cational and fund-raising cam-
paign this April.

These fraternities have volun-
teered more than 250 men, assert-
ed Mrs. John A. Byerly, chair-
man of the Central City District
Crusade organization. Under the
leadership of Sigma Alpha Epsi-
lon’s Gary Harrison, Bus. Ad., sr.,
the students will canvass more
than 3000 homes in the Wightman
area.

Harrison, who worked in the
1960 Crusade, stated, “The Amer-
ican Cancer Society is helping
the university —- over the years

they have given $758,115.37 for
cancer research alone -- and it is

only right that the students help."

the Society.

“Besides,” he added, “we feel
that by taking on thelproject the
fraternity men are showing they
are yvilling to accept civic re-
sponsibility' and are not just out
for a good time.”

Sophomores
who intend to enter the school in-
the spring or fall should pre-
register in order to vote.

Candidates

In the face of recent campaign
developments, it
that student voters end up con-
fused and ignorant at election
time, according to SG presidential
candidate Rich Sobota.

Sobota noted that one of the
most ' confusing aspects of this
campaign has been the constant
changes which have taken place
in the President-Vice President
slates of the various parties.

“It is practically impossible for
a student to know, at any given
moment, just who is running, who,
was running, what parties exist,
and what each one stands for,” he
said. '

Sobota pointed out that one in-

Graduation

Date Changed

To Saturday  

Commencement exercises ‘this
year will break one more of the
once long-standing traditions at
the University. For the first time

of the usual
mony. .

University officials announced
that the date has been changed
to June 10 in order that more
o‘«Jt—o1'—town parents could at-
tend. .

“With more and more students
coming to the University from out
of town, we feel that a Saturday
will be more convenient, giving
parents an opportunity to attend
wtihout interfering with their
working hours,” commented Vice
Chancellor Alan Rankin.

The plan also provides those
students who graduate in April
and who may be working out of
town with an opportunity to at-
tend their commencement cere-
mony. _

The trimester plan also has
made it necessary to change this
traditional date, since commence-
ment -no longer coincides with
the end of the term.

“This eliminates the necessity
of dismissing classes for an -en-

Wednesday Cere-

-tire day,” Rankin said.

Since commencement will be
conducted the same this year as
in the past, university officials

do not feel that too much of the
old tradition will be missing by
the change of, days.

To Perform

‘Hedda G-abler’

By KAREN HALPERT
The University Theatre
Players will present their

second major performance of

the season, “Hedda Gabler,”
Feb. 16 through 19 at 8:30

pm. in Stephen Foster Me-i

morial.

“Hedda Gabler”, by lleinreich
Ibsen, is the story of a woman
who has an almost consuming
need to control the destiny of hu-
man beings. Ibsen, a great believ-
er in the emancipation of women,
portrays her as the symbol of all
strongly motivated women de-
get the most from
life.

Ruth Beall, a speech major with
theater arts emphasis, will star
in the leading role of this drama,
playing opposite Larry Heller,
Speech Major, as George Tesman.

The University Theatre pre-
sented “Toad of Toad Hall”, a
children’s play, earlier this sea-
son. Among their performances
last season, were Eugene O’Neill’s
“Anna Cristi” and Arthur Miller’s
“All My Sons.”

In the future they plan to pre-
sent at least one major produc-
tion a semester. Any University
student may audition for these
future productions.

The cast of “Hedda Gabler” has

been in rehearsal for almost a
month.
“These people have worked

tremendously hard,” commented
Dr. John Ulrich, director of the
play. “We hope that‘ University
students will come to share the

results of our efforts with us on,

the three days that the play will
be open."

There will be no admission
charge for “Hedda Gabler”, but
reserved seats can be obtained
in the Speech Department, l.l16

By JIM O'BRIEN
Sylvia Rivera-Santini is an

summer and travelled here to
obtain a master’s degree.

Serving as chief of the Budget
Section for the Department of
Justice in San Juan, she was
granted a leave of absence to at-

Miss Rivera—Santini received her

College in Washington, where she
obtained a bachelor’s degree in
French.

She continued her schooling by
taking courses in public admini-
stration at the University of
Puerto Rico. She was later select-
ed by her superiors to attend
school here.

‘Wonderful Experience‘

“Attending school here has been
a wonderful experience. There are
people from so many countries
who have different customs, cul-
tures, and ideas, and we le.arn
from each other by discussing
problems informally and in the
classroom seminars.

“In my country many stu-
dents from all parts of the
world are there, observing “Op-
eration Bootstrap"——a program
of our government for economic
and social development. This
recent atmosphere has inspired
me to study more in the ﬁeld
of foreign relations.”

She gave many critical evalu-
ations ol” some of the problems in
affairs. Comment-
ing on Kennedy’s new plan for
giving surplus food to Latin
American countries, she said,
“Caution should be exercised, be-
cause people don’t like to receive
hancl—outs. They prefer loans. It
is a good idea, however, and the
surplus should be used construc-
tivcly.”

Commencement Du y

Tradition is one of the hardest‘ things to develop at
any university. Tradition—breaking is quiet easy. Although
many may consider tradition-breaking sacrilegious, many
examples can be cited that prove that this is not always
true. \

For example, the university recently announced that
this year Commencement Day fould not beheld on the sec
‘ond Wednesdayof June, but instead would be pushed back

, four days to Saturday, June 10.
By doing this, students graduating in April who are»

already working will be able to attend. Last year, many‘
studentswho had looked forward to their commencement,
found that they could not be excused from their jobs. It is
unfair to the student who wants to participate in the com-

_-mencementexercises to miss it because of an out—dated

Greelr Sing

Sororoities and Fraternities will present “Songs
Through the Ages,” this Friday, at the annual Greek Sing.
The traditional night of singing not only gives the Greeks
the opportunity to compete artistically, but in addition pro-
vides all University members who like music the oppor-
tunity to hear their favorite songs.

Although several of.’ the events of Greek Week were
restricted to members by necessity, "the Greeks have in-
vited Independents to join them in as many instances as
possible for example the Greek Sing.’ ‘ I

This event is one which university students looked
forward to each year and appreciated because of the quality
of their performance.

The Spirit of Camus

By Ina Amdur

It is rare for a writer to gain the love of his
readers through his books. _They may love his
characters or his thoughts but seldom does the
ﬂesh and blood presence of the human being who
created the characters or who wrote the thoughts
  penetrate through the imperson-
al black ink. It is yet more rare
for a writer to maintain the love
of his readers after he has died.

Grief for those who have died
is transitory much as we would
like it to be otherwise. It would
‘ isecm, then, that grief over the
‘ death of someone whom one
« knew only from the pages of a

book would be non-existent
This was not so in the case of Albert Camus, the
1957 Nobel Prize winner who died in an automobile
accident January 4, 1960.

, More than a year after his death memorials‘ are

still being written to him. The strange quality of
these memorials is that they speak not so much
of his writings as they do of him, that they speak
not so much of what he said as of what he was.
Memory Revered

It is not hard, if one has read Camus’ works
to discover why his memory is revered. He once
said that “truth needs witnesses.” Perhaps it is.
then. that when a rare human being who has been
both the witness and the discoverer of some truths
dies, those stumbling human beings who are left
behind treat thedead person as the pricker of
their consciences. In remembering him, they re-
member what he said. What he said is what the
consciences of most men say. Perhaps their voices
are only much less articulate and much more falt-
ering. _

For Camus the twentieth century was hovering

ice and through slush! Do they

over a great abyss——the abyss of nihilism. It had
lost its gods, and with the disappearance of its gods
came the disappearance of its values. The World
had lost its meaning, and some thought that this
was an invitation to tyranny. For if human lives

have no meaning anyway, why not misuse them?\

But Camus taught a philosophy of limits to be im-
posed by human beings upon themselves.
Revolt Required

Revolt was required in this universe in which
children suffer and die.” But revolt turns all too
easily into tyranny. The minute that rebellion loses
sight of itsaims and destroys values, rather than
creating them, that it is the minute that it becomes
revolution. ‘

For Camus the human condition of dying and
suffering was one that only could be overcome by
a common human attempt at solidarity. He, one

of the godless, preached a strange form of love,“

One might say that he preached a secular saint-
hood and that he too derived his symbol from the
cross. However, for Camus all men who ever lived
carried a cross and only a common effort would
make the burden any less cumbersome.

For forty—six years Camus lived as a philoso.
pher, a critics, a moralist, a dramatist, and a novel-
ist. He was the master of the lucid phrase and the
lyrical sentence. He was the quintessence of the.
French ideal of the “engaged man.” Then his al.
most painful lucidity was destroyed by the equally
painful neutrality of death. His death would not
be so sad, did the twentieth century not need his
words so badly’. As it is the rest is silence; He
can say of Camus what he said of someone else:
“We were cheated of a man ‘a year ago and since
then we have had a heavy heart. For us who loved

',p

him and for all those who without knowing him, _

deserved to love him, this is a dead loss.”

Coed Finds Chivalry
Dead in‘Winter

, Editor, zqie Pitt News:

As I am a part ‘time student
(female) at Pitt, I feel justified
in allowing myself the oppor-
tunity at this time of making a
‘slight, but not insigniﬁcant, re-
mark, (Complaint, if you will)

college men. (This, I would say,
includes three—fourths of them!)

I realize wholeheartedly that
this snowy weather has every-
one in a rut. Nevertheless, does
this mean that chivalry must
perish? If you are, by chance,
having trouble tying these two
matters together, let me be more
explicit.

Why in Heavcn’s name don”:
our men (ahem!) come to the
rescue of our “vulnerable” crea-
tures (women) when they see
them struggling helplessly over

are not made of stone is the
twitching, silly-faced grins no-
ticeable all the while. we are
struggling, such grins becoming
wider and wider ’till they liter-
ally are stretched from ear “to
ear of the possessor.

Now I ask you. Is that chiv-,
alry? Is it asking too much of
these lusty, energetic, able—bodi-
ed individuals for a bit of as-
sistance now and then?

I am rather certain that the
small overtures of benevolence

Several times during the past

with my toes tingling, my nose
turning red, and my ears start-

what a relief when the clang

Fraternities Called
Caste System
Editor, The Pitt News:

I think it appropriate that

with Greek Week in the offing\

the time is ripe for a few com-

ments onthese Greek organiza- I

tions.

These Greek organizations are
nothing more than a ridiculous.
and juvenile caste system. Any
good which these Greek—letter
societies accomplish is far out-
weighed by the unhappiness and
heartbreak which they inflict
upon thousands of people every
year, and ‘by the class-conscious-
ness, religious bigotry and race
prejudice.

iOnce in a sorority or frater-
nity, a student is compelled to‘.
conform to a caste system
whether he approves it or not.
Greek-letter students are a min-
ority on most campuses, and Pitt
is no exception, but are so tight-
ly knit and politically organized
that they generally control elec-
tions. Is this the way we want
things in a democracy?

The only obvious advantage
to these societies is that they
provide a degree of “Social
Security” which

loge students really need an or-
ganization of this type to pro-
vide their “friends”?

Any thinking student can seek
out and find a group of students
having similar views which he,
or she, may associate while re-
greater all-around bene-
ﬁts.

1-... 3 —- THE 1-rrr NEWS -— Wednesday, February 15, 1951

If theory is validated by
two _upcoming contests, the
hypothesis that the Panther
basketball team is a “home
club" will be ﬁrmly proved.
The roundballers are expect-
ed by critical buffs to win tonight's
Field House affair with Fordham,
and be defeated in Morgantown
by ‘West Virginia Saturday.

The Rams were pasted with a

-..setback over the weekend by Can-

isius, and their outﬁt lsn’t as for-
midable as in past years accord-
ing to reliable sources. Lou Ros-
sini, the NYU mentor. whose Vio-
lets were defeated by Duquesne on
Saturday, said about the Rams:
‘They're terrible.”

Coach Bob Timmons still main-
tains that he can’t fortell the out-

come of future games, but he does
hold more respect for the Rams.
"Johnny Bach always has a good
team, but our boys play better at
home."

Hurt on Road

So far the Cats haveigained nine
of their ten wins on the home
court, and the other victory was a
tough overtime struggle with
Temple in Philadelphia. On the
road, the Panthers have dropped
five out of six encounters.

So the Mounties are expected
to deal the visitors their tenth
setback. George King's ﬁve
erupted with a tough verdict
which was only decided in the
closing moments. But on the
friendly hardwood of their own
gym. .West Virginia isn't ex-
pected to have as much trouble.

 

“They’re tougher at home,"
Timmons commented, “but we’ve
played good ball down there the
last couple of years, even though
we haven't won for five years. We
did a good job at home. If we had
made fewer mistakes, we could
have beaten them.”

Thorn Expected to Fare

There is much speculation as to
how Rod Thorn. the highly—pub-
licized successor to Rod I-Iundley
and Jerry West, will {are after
having performed so poorly in
Pittsburgh. “He’ll be more conﬁ-
dent at home, but we can discour-
age him with good defense,” Tim-
mons mentioned.

Despite the pressure of the‘
two games this week, Timmons
is still fuming over the Penn
State loss Saturday. Whenever

his Blue and Gold yearling
cagers will play host to the
Jayvees from Carnegie Tech
today. In their last meeting
the yearlings trounced the
Tartans 74-44 on the losers’ court.

Peterson felt that this next en-
counter should be no more difficult
than the last: “Tech is inexperi-
enced. Many ,,of their boys have
little high school experience,” he
said. “This next game on our
‘home ﬂoor, should be no more dif-

p Next Saturday,’ the Cubs will
move down to West Virginia where
they will meet the WVU freshmen.
The Cubs beat the Mountaineers
87-79 and broke their 29 game
winning streak at the field house
on Jan. 18.

' Barger and Bill Maphis are top
guns for the Mountaineers, aver-
aging 20 and 14 points respec-
tively. “They are big and tough,”
Peterson said. “Besides, they are
great shooters from the outside.”
WVU has not lost a game since
their only defeat at the hands of
the Yearlings.

The Cubs now own a 10-2 rec-
o1"d for the season. Their only
.Io'§ses were to Slippery Rock and
Duquesne. V

O .
eran mentor has a special gleam

in his eye when he talks about

the sophomores on this ‘ year's
squad.
State. 2-1 for the season, is

having an oﬁ year by Wettstone’s
standards.

But the Lions have eight
sophomores on their 18-man
roster and Wettstone predicts
a quick rise to stardom for his
young phenoms.

“We have a basically young
team,” Wettstone said, “but they
are developing fast and are be-
coming a well-knit unit.

“Of course a young team looks
to the good all-around men for
leadership,” the lanky coach con-
tinued.

The Lions have two good all-
around men on the squad this
year.

One is junior Greg Weiss, the
high scorer for the Lions. The
other is sophomore Tommy Sc-
ward.

Seward has been looking good
in practice all week, after being
limited to two third places in last
week’s 581/2—37% loss to Navy.

“He has been. hitting real
dwell," Wettstone said. “If he
hits that way this Saturday, it
might make the difference.”

Seward will compete on the
horizontal bar, the parallel bars
and in tumbling.

Seward is just one of five soph-
omores who might hold the key
to State’s fortunes for the re-
mainder of the season.

Tom Page, George Williams,
George Sayre and Gene Har-
lacher have held down starting
spots on the team all year.

Cat Frosh Compete
In Opening Matching
By BOB SMIZIK
Their toughest assignment
of the year awaits the Pan-

ther grapplers when they
travel to Lehigh on Saturday.
The Engineers boast an un-
blemished record of 8-0 and

are ranked among the country's
top teams. In a preliminary the
Cat Frosh will meet their Lehigh
counterparts.

The Brown and White will be
out to avenge last year’s 19-11 loss
at the hands of the Panthers. They
are strong in every weight class
and it will take an outstanding ef-
fort by the Panthers to bring home
a victory. ‘

Coach Rex Peery feels that “we
will need wins from our first four
men and a fifth victory will be
needed from either Jim Harrison
or Bob Guzik.”

Martin Favored

Winning the ﬁrst four weight
classes will be no easy task for
the Blue and Gold. Comparative
scores show Dick Martin to have
an advantage over Bill Merriam at
123 pounds and Larry Lauchle
holds a victory over his probable
opponent, Doug Baillie.

But at the 137 and 147 pound
classes the Cats may run into
trouble. Last year Daryl Kel-
vington could do no better than
a draw against Curt Alexander.
These two will meet again on
Saturday.

Fred DeMann Top Panther Rooter

Campus Driver Unstoppable

Lilcetible Operator

Climbs M ountain.

‘Daily for Athletes

By JIM O'BRIEN

Neither rain, nor sleet, nor
snow can hinder Fred De-
Mann from keeping the cam-
pus bus on the go. And the
squat, grizzly bus driver has
had more of enough, of in-
clement weather in his first year
at the wheel to satisfy him for
eternity. .

The amiable Italian claims that
he remains “cool” all’ day during
his monotonous 27 trips up the

winding road that spirals to the '

Field House. His altitude mileage
rivals that of Sir Edmund Hillary
of Mt. Everest fame, but Fred
probably feels that he has more
obstacles in his path. I

During the recent “Operation
Snowfall” in our city, Fred has

had to find alternate routes. navi-
gate up onto the curbs, blast
through snowdrifts, and still re-
tain his eerie sense of slithering in
and out of tight squeezes.

Moves With Ease

Students riding the bus, ot*ten¢

wince in. empathy when Fred is
maneuvering between two cars on
the narrow streets of his journey.
“Swoosh. Some day,” is a com-
mon phrase of Fred’s vocabulary
nowadays. When a football player
inquired, ‘Sometimes you wonder
whether it’s worth it,” Fred quick-
ly retorted, “Oh, it’s worth it.”

The mud-splattered bus isn’t
Fred’s first experience under
such hazardous conditions. “It
reminds me of Alaska,” he re-
marked. Fred’s knowledge of
the climate of Alaska isn’t lim-
ited to cinemascope, for he drove
trucks on the frozen surfaces
during his tenure with the
Army.

In order to keep warm, Fred
wears a red and black jacket, dec-
orated with a chenille football,
symbolic of his football playing
days. Fred manned the guard po-
sition of the Bloomﬁeld Rams,
Steel Bowl Conference champions,
when the incomparable Johnny

._ Unitas, of Baltimore Colt fame,

was calling the signals.
S Johnny Was Great

“He was great,” Fred recalled.
::Anytime you. can go undefeated
in semi-pro ball, you’re tough.
Johnny never thought he’d get a
chance to play pro ball, but he
sure does, doesn’t he?”

Fred is regarded as a “great
guy” by the athletes whom he
motors to and from practice
every day. After hours he
doesn’t desert them either. He
{tees all the football games, and
18 a regular at the basketball
contests.

At this time one of the passen-
gers howled, “When is this bus go-
mg to leave.” Fred hollered back,
"Hey, I don't get interviewed every
day. hold on.” -

AS the interview ended, Fred

This past weekend, a Pittsburgh
city team, composed of Dave
O’Loughlin, Joe Brown and Ralph
Mason Jr., the Panther’s number
one, two and three ranked play-
ers, competed in the National
Tournament at the University of
Pennsylvania

According to Coach Summers,
“The boys ‘ did exceptionally
well in defeating Harvard, last
year’s runner-up. .In their loss
to a. top-ranked Canadian team,
they might have been at a. psy-
chological disadvantage because
of the Canadians high ratings.

“The trip was very educational,”
states Summers, “Our boys learned
a, great deal by watching Diehl
Mateer, the nations number one
player, and Henri Salaun, ranked
second in the nation.”

The Orangemen of Syracuse come to the campus to take
on the ever improving Panther mermen squad at the Tech
Pool this Saturday at 8:00 p.m. ‘ ’

The Aquatic Cats will fa

ce a rather thin and inexperi-

enced squad under the mentor of Coach Ted Webster. Web-
ster returned to Syracuse after a year’s leave of absence to

begin his 31st season as swim:

coach at the Orange helm.

‘The main power of theorange
team seems to be centered in a
powerful trio of swimming aces.
The Orangemen are counting on
Jack Nesbitt, Jim Tuck and Greg
Pond to score heavily. ,

Coach Ted Webster calls Nes-
bitt the best distance swimmer
that he has coached in his 3] sea-
sons at Syracuse. Nesbitt holds
the Orange record in the 200 and
400-yard freestyle events.

Both Tuck and Pond are top
juniors for the Orange squad.
Tuck is a sprinter while Pond is
perhaps the most versatile man on
the team as witnessed by his com-
petition in freestyle, butterﬂy, and
individual medley events last
year.

After a swarnping 63-32 defeat
at the hands of the Panthers last
year, the Orange will deﬁnitely be

Rees’ Trackmen Still  
Fighting for 1st Victory

Harvard to Compete Without Top Performer;
Meet Could Be Decided in Relay Events
By JACK SMITH
Panther coach Carl Rees will have a triple incentive to
win the dual meet against Harvard Saturday. First, Har-
vard’s coach Bill McCurdy was Rees’ coach when he attended
Springﬁeld College. Next, the assistant coach at Harvard
was Rees’ teammate at college, and lastly, the track team
has yet to gain a win in three attempts.

The only point of comparison
for Rees is" the two teams’ en-

counter with Army. The Panthers

lost to Army 561/2 to 54% while
Harvard dumped the Cadets 57-
511/2.

Rees, however, received some
news this week that could im-
prove his team’s chances. Tom
Blodgett, Harvard’s top man in
the high jump, pole vault, hurdles
and broad jump, pulled a muscle
and will be unable to compete.

“This was a break,” Rees
said. “This guy is a great com-
petitor and would have been
good for 12 points.

Harvard is favored in Satur-
day’s meet despite the absence of
Blodgett. They have Mark Mullin
in the mile. Mullin did a 4211 out-
door mile last summer and out-
classes any Panther competitor
for the same distance. Bob Tar-
kany would normally run for the
Cats but he may be out of action
with a sore archilles heel.

Harvard also has two of the
best 35-pound weight throwers
in the country in Stan Doteni
and Ted Baily. They are credit-

ed with heaves of 64‘5” and 60’ .

respectively. The Panther’s Dick
Clark has a toss of 57”?” to his
ledger. ,

The meet could once again-be
decided in the mile and two—mile
Relays Both Harvard and the
Panthers beat Army in the two-
mile relays but only the Cats de-
feated the Cadets in the mile re-
lay.

Bob Gunst will be John Zoli-
koff’s opponent. The two have not
met before but Gunst holds a deci-
sion over the defending National
Champion, Ted J ones, of Iowa
State. " '

Turner Rates High

Lehi_gh’s captain, Thad Turner,
was the Eastern champ at 167
pounds. He may be moved up in
weight thus eliminating the chance
of a meeting with Harrison. If he
does wrestle at 167 pounds, Harri-
son will probably move d.own to
157 pounds.

The Engineers are also strong
at 157 pounds, 191 pounds and
the heavyweight division. Kirk
Pendleton, Dave Angeli and
Charles M o o r e, respectively,
represent Lehigh in these divi-
sions.

In addition to Martin, Lauchle,
Kelvington, Zolikoﬂ’, Harrison and
Guzik, Peery will use Augie Arri-
gone, Bill Robb and Paul Wilson.

Lehigh holds a victory over
Army which has already beaten
the Panthers. They also have a
24-8 win over Penn State.

Peery feels that the team that
wins on Saturday “will be the best
in the East,” and the Panthers
‘need. this one,” to insure a suc-
