Wrong Class

Phi Kaps, SAlVls Dlaintain
Illegal Houses, States City

. By CHARLES CAMARATA

Old thorn in the side of Neville street fraternities, Phi Kappa and .

Sigma Alpha Mu, is the city ordinance prohibiting boarding houses on
Neville street from Center avenue to Wallingford street. For fraternities

are considered boarding houses.

Brought into prominence two weeks ago when a real estate agent
proposed that that section of the street be changed from a class B to a
class A zone, thereby permitting fraternity houses, the ordinance was
considered by city council and not changed.

Though the two fraternities are, still, as for years, illegal dwelling
places according to city ordinance, fraternity spokesmen view the de-

cision with little alarm since no action was taken in the past and probably ‘

will not be for the next two or three years.

Commentinguppon this perennially discussed ordinance and its pos- .

sible enforcement, John Hughes, C42, president of Phi Kappa, said, “If
city otﬁcials do an about-face and enforce the ordinance, we may have
to move. But for the past 15 years it has not been strictly enforced,
and if they decide to do so now, not only our house but a large number
of other dwelling houses on Neville street may (Continued on page four)

ll’ YOU ARE a college man whose number has been
called up by your local draft board and you desire deferment
by virtue of your course of studies, it is important that _vou
consult with the dean of your school as soon as possible.

This is the gist of an urgent request made by the Penn-
sylvania  headquarters of the selective service board in
collaboration with University officials.

The state headquarters emphasizes that no group defer-
ments are possible under the present law and that all defer-
ments must be handled as individual cases.

As announced in Monday’s Pitt News. consideration for
deferment is given to those students registered in the follow-

ing courses:

Engineering: civil, electrical, chemical. inining and metal-
lurgical, and -mechanical, agricultural, and sanitary.

Chemistry, dentistry, pharmacy. physics, biology and bac-
teriology; geology, geo-physics. meterology, hydrology, carto-

graphy, and medicine.

deadline may just as well forget about them, be-
cause word received today from Dr. William
Mather Lewis, Pennsylvania selective service
head, puts the screws to any such idea.

Dr. Lewis says no. He says, well, we’ll quote
him directly, “At the present moment there does
not seem to be much likelihood that any amend-
ment will be adopted providing for a further
period of deferment for all college students as
such.”

To justify his statement, he points out that
the act speciﬁcally prohibits additional group de-
ferment and that since the time of the passage
of the Burke Wadsworth bill students have had
plenty of time “to plan their future with the
knowledge that there are liabilities for service
which must be met.”

After July 1, the only students deferred by
the Selective Service act are:

Class 4-B——Cadets who have completed two
academic years in the ROTC and who have been
selected by the president of their school or the
professor of military science for -further training
and who have executed a contract with the gov-
ernment as cadets of the advanced course.

Class 4-D-—Students preparing for the min-
istry in a- theological or divinity school recog-
nized as such for more than a year prior to the
date of enactment of the Selective Training and

Service act (September 16, 1940).

All of which means simply this:

If your number has been called up and you
are not an engineer or enrolled in the above
named technical courses and you are not attend-
ting some divinity school and you are not in the
advanced ROTC corps, you had better make the
most out of these last few weeks of college life;
because you’re in the army . . . soon.

(Liberal arts, education, bus ad, law, and re-
tail training students note well, please.)

Wanted: More Gags-n
ﬂld, Corny, Preferred

AFTER THE SLAPSIE-Maxie Rosenbloom
episode, we passed it all off as an unfortunate
accident.

The Gene Autry business, however, leads to
extend some sort of invitation.

We herewith invite to our campus all broken
down press agents and publicity men. Do you
need work? Are you all out of fresh ideas? Do
you ﬁnd that audiences are becoming wise to
your stunts? Come to Pitt. We go for anything.
‘The oldest gags grow richer with repetition.

Attention, washed—out prize ﬁghters, glamour-
pants cowboys, scat singers, and boop—boop-a-
doop girls. Is your popularity fading? Do you
need a shot in the arm in the form of favorable
publicity? Come to Pitt. We are tired of real
talent. We want corn.

No longer need you shake and make embar-
rassed retreat when someone shouts, “Hire a
hall.” We will ﬁnd one for you.

Come to Pitt. ‘N e have lots of honorary de-
grees lying about. There are almost a hundred
classrooms in which you may spout to thousands
of students. We will wine and dine you. Come
to Pitt.

Now you know where vaudeville went when
it died.

Point of Information:

LAST WEEKS Reginxéntal review showed
that few Pﬁt “civilians” know what to do when
the flag goes by. Several times we saw both
men and women students either remain seated
or slouch at ease when the colors passed. It
might be a good idea, for self protection if for
no more decent reasons, for persons to learn the

 proper attitudes of deference to the national

mblem. Any ROTC man will give you the in-
' ormation. If you don’t want to take a ROTC’s
an’s word for it, look it up for yourself. At

T if ny rate, next time the colors pass. do more than

ick your wrist, and say, “Pretty. ain't it.”

ject that my PM (Post Mortem) address would be
No. 2, Royal Palace row, Hades. This accounts for
my blighted hopeless look and my devilish disposition.

My grandmother was famous for her skill at mak-
ing cookies and when she made some all the kids could
be found hanging around our kitchen. We used to
sneak in and steal them, hot from the oven, under her
very nose, and wait expectantly. The expectant wait-
ing was because whenever my grandmother tried to
scold us her false teeth would slip, and the resultant
sounds that issued forth sounded like very virulent
profanity. This would set us off into laughing ﬁts,
and she would grow angrier and sometimes spank us,
as we deserved, but since she scolded while she spanked,
we did not feel the scientiﬁc laying on of hands, and
would roar visibly till our sides ached, and we had to
roll on the ground.

Is It Possible?

My brother originated the striptease one hot day.
He was at that time about as old chronologically as he
now is mentally, and it was a very hot day, so there
were extenuating circumstances. It seems he just got
tired of clothes, took his off, and went on playing under
the drip of a water-faucet. We caught him thus, and
chased him, for half an hour, under the noses of
gabbling old ladies, before we could catch him and
dress him decently, if untidily.

In the afternoons when the sun was hot and the
grass warm and the cicadas buzzed drowsily through
the rustling tree leaves, we would stretch out on the
ground lazily, planning Indian battles. We boasted
of the great heights at which we had carved our ini-

tials on church steeples and trees and watched the:

ants crawl by, at peace with the world and feeling
happy. We had no worries for the morrow, for the
breeze was pleasant, and life was good.

The End.

SN\lTH lS PRESIDENT OF
ROAMOKE COLLEGE.’

Bawdy Politics

Astonishment on both sides of the
campus political scene resulted from
the announcement Friday of the re-
sults in last week’s general student
elections. The fraternity victory
sweep was unexpected even by fra-
ternity men, many of whom felt
that their party would be fortunate
to obtain as large a majority in SFA
as they had during the past year.

Selection of executive commit-
tee is the ﬁrst item on the program
of the newly — elected assembly.
No deﬁnite word has come from
fraternity source, yet concerning
their choice for membership in ex-
ecutive committee. Election results
indicate that the fraternities are
entitled to all six student places on
the committee.

Experienced campus political
observers say that the smartest
move the fraternities can make
this year is to put one or two in-
dependents on the executive group.
This would give the committee the
prestige which comes from bi-
partisan organization, and would
remove the possibility of Inde-
pendent charging the fraternities
with “dirty politics” in executive
committee.

Roy Ruane, Phi Delta Theta, is
slated to be fraternity candidate for
president of the group. If the In-
dependen'ts seek to run a candidate

Yates Heads Engineers’

Seminar for Next Year

Campbell C. Yates, ’42, has been
elected chairman for the senior
aeronautical and mechanical en-
gineering seminar for the coming
year. Other oiﬁcers chosen last
week are: Paul Carney, ’42, vice
chairman; Walter Logan, ’42, sec-
retary; and Russell Love, ’42, trea-
surer.

Representatives to the Engineer-
ing association will be David Ma-
maux, ’42, and Joseph Sire, ’42.
The seminar, organized as the local
student chapter of the American
Society of Mechanical Engineers.
will again be divided into two sec-
tions: the senior group. composed of
juniors and seniors, and the junior
group \v‘*-th freshman sophomore
members.

Analysis of Last Week's
Fiasco Shows Elections
Aren't Won by Posters

for that position or for any post on
executive committee, the candidate
is expected to be Steve Minno, high
ranking senior man of the Inde-
pendents this year. Minno placed
second only to Hillard Kreimer, Pi
Lambda Phi, in the senior man
classiﬁcation at the election. Ed

Tait, other senior man of the In-
dependents, is likely to be the other
candidate for executive committee.

Fred Robie, this year’s Indepen-
dent leader, stated Friday that the
loss of the Indendents at the elec-
tion was caused by a faulty analysis
of student politics. He said: “The
poor showing of the Independents
resulted from failure to use ward
boss politics of signing cards prom-
ising to vote slate.”

Alvin J. Ludwig, Theta Chi, could
not be reached for a statement Fri-
day due to his absen-ce from the
campus, but the consensus of fra-
ternity opinion was that the sma-sh-
ing victory in Wednesday’s elections
was the result of the support given
to fraternity slates by women’s fra-
ternities which had not been includ-
ed in previous elections. Another
reason given for the fraternity SFA
and CA sweep was the careful bal-
ancing of slates, giving each about
225 basic votes in the balloting.

One Independent summed up the
election loss in this manner: “You
can’t win an election with posters.”

I by Oscar
Spring Song

In the spring a young man’s fancy

turns to love and thoughts of
hinter-

lands, to birds and bees; in short

to what the girls have thought all
winter.

The Goblins’l1 Get You

If, in the still of evening, you should
hear a thousand screams,
And looking out your window see
what one sees but in dreams,
If you see a million pixies there,
cavorting on the grass,
And if they come into your room,
with manner mean and crass,
If they should swarm about you,
shouting threats into your
ears,
And if they say they’ve lots of time,
and they can wait for years,
Don’t get yourself excited; and don’t
reach for your pants,
They’re just Finale salesmen, sell-
ing tickets to the dance.

number of entrees, with the sopho-
more class running a close second.

As a ﬁnal reminder, Miss Acker
urges all women athletes to report
for the various sports events
promptly to insure a fast-moving
and interesting program.

Diamond Squad
To Battle W. Va.

Well ahead of their 1939 and 1940
records, the 1941 Panther baseball
team appears at home on Friday
for the the ﬁrst time this year with
West Virginia supplying the oppo-
sition.

The Mountaineers will appear at
the Stadium both Friday and Satur-
day afternoon, but the Friday clash
is ‘expected to be the big aﬁaair,
coming as the climax of the after-
noon’s Spring Festival activities.

Either Bob Malloy or Edgar Jones
will take the mound for the Panther
Friday, with Charley Seabright
slated to draw the mound assign-
ment for West Virginia. Malloy
will probably Work Friday, which
would leave Jones for Saturday.

In each of the past two years,
two of Pitt’s three victories have
been recorded against the West Vir-
ginians. Lefthander Andy Johnson
stopped them twice in 1939, while
Ben Kish and Jones took their
measure last season.

Leading hitter for the Mountain--
eers is Charley Hockenberry,
lanky catcher who bats left-
handed and who will be aiming for
the short Stadium fence in right
ﬁeld all afternoon. Hockenberry’s
presence gives West Virginia a con-
sequent slight edge in this respect,
for only one Pitt batter, ﬁrst base-
man Johnny Brown, is a right ﬁeld
hitter.

300 Greeks to Compete for Awards

At Thursday’s

. By ALEX ZELENSKI

Fraternity tracksters will hold the
intra.nnural spotlight next Thursday
afternoon at 2 o‘clock in the Pitt
Stadium when the 13 Greek houses
vie for the annual Spring Festival
trophy.

For the first time since the advent
of the cinder meet, awards will be
presented on the ﬁeld to the ﬁrst
and second place winners. Presen-
tations will be made by a group of
Pitt lovelies over the public address
system following the ﬁnal results of
each meet.

Fraternity interest is at a high
peak this year, for 300 contestants

are expected to compete for the
prizes.

Fijis Favored

Phi Gamma Delta, last year’s IF
track meet titleholder, should again
be top favorites to retain their title.
Last year they virtually walked
away with the crown by scoring 24
more points than their closest riv-
als, Kappa Sigma and Phi Delta
Theta.

The meets most difficult event,
the 880-yard relay, will have the
championship Fiji squad back again
for another title. Earl Pressell,
John Bitner, Bobby Thurbon, and
Bob Quick, composed the victorious
team last year, and should not have
trouble beating their rivals again.

The shot put record of 47 feet 6
inches set by “Chris” Watson, Phi
Gam graduate, will probably go
on unbroken for none of the leading
shot put stars of IF have come close.
Dick Mansﬁeld and Earl Pressell
will endeavor to keep the shot put
crown in’ their house.

Pole Vault Mark Safe

Last year’s 100-yard dash showed
one of the best events of the day
when Edgar Jones nosed out Bobby
Thurbon and Ray Conley by inches.
Jones ran the events in 10.3, but
may not be able to run this year be-
cause of a wrenched knee.

The pole vault mark of 10 feet

.'P.'."l

BOB THURBON
ready to star

was set in 1939 by Jimmy Kennedy,
Delta Tau Delta star, and will prob-
ably be another mark that will go
on unbroken. Rodusch of the Phi
Garns won last year, but will not
be back this time. Closest rivals
last year were his teammates, Pot-
ter and Reuter, and Phi Delt Robin-
son.

Johnny Dickinson copped the
hop, step, and jump match, and the
broad jump for the past two years
for the Phi Delta Theta squad, but

Thetas Take Lead
In Coed Bowling

Fraternity competition in the wo-
men’s bowling tournament is keen
this week as the contest comes to a
close with only a few games remain-
ing to be played.

Kappa Alpha ‘Theta ranks highest
with a score of 108 1-5. Zeta Tau
Alpha is second with 108, and Phi
Sigma Sigma is third with 106.

Bowlers of Delta Zeta, Kappa
Gamma, and Phi Mu will meet this
week for their scheduled game.

Cards Favored Over Debaters;
APD Squad Meets Amity Club

Notice—Because of Spring Fes-
tival week there will be no intra-
mural competition after tomorrow.
Schedules will resume next Mon-
day afternoon.

Independent teams will take over
the intramural program today and
tomorrow in an attempt to play off
all rained-out mushball contests.

The Cardinals, made up exclu-
sively of Chemical specials are, at
the present time, one of the few
unbeaten squads in the independent
circuit. The Red Birds came close
to winning the title last year when
their veteran squad lost out in the
ﬁnal games of the season.

Jim Gleason, Cardinal veteran, is
the independent league’s leading
pitcher as he has set down three
teams with remarkable ease. Steve
Matiyak is batting in -the clean-up
post and has been coming through
nobly time after time.

Their game with the Debaters to-
day at 4 o’clock on ﬁeld 1 should
add another victory in the Cardin-
als ledger.

Alpha Phi Delta team takes on
the Amity club on ﬁeld 2 at 4
o’clock, and should be another easy
triumph for the better—than-aver-
age APD squad. The APD’s have
a record of 2 won and 1 lost, which
is much better than their oppo-
nents.

Steve Zurnich is the hurler for
the APD nine, and has proven his
worth in games played thus far

this season. Paul Cerchiara and
Carmen Capone are the team’s lead-
ing hitters, and should have an-
other ﬁeld day against the Amity
Club nine today.

Other games scheduled for today
are the Bus Ad-Upper Denture
ﬁasco, and the battle of the engi-
neers between the Electricals and
the AE & ME senior team.

Eta Kappa Nu Selects

Johnson for President

Eta Kappa Nu, honorary electrical
engineering fraternity, recently
elected Ralph E. Johnson, ’42, pres-
ident for 1941-42 year.

As vice-president, the fraternity
selected Emil J. -Servant, ’42; sec-
retary, James W. Carr, ’42; and
treasurer, Harry P. Pﬂueger, ’42.

James D. Finley, ’42, will be in
charge of public correspondence,
while Robert L. Pratt, ’42, will be
corresponding secretary. P. E. Rush,
assistant professor of electrical en-
gineering, will act as faculty ad-
viser.

Phi Alpha Theta . . .

honorary history fraternity, will
hold a business meeting on Wed-
nesday evening in Heinz house at 6
o’clock.

Ofﬁcers for the coming year will
be elected and installed. The meet-
ing will be open after dinner.

Annual IF Track Meet

is another record holder who won’t
be back.

Bobby Thurbon challenged Dick-
inson in the broad jump last year,
and should be counted upon to be
one of the standout performers in
Thursday’s meet. Second place in
the hop, step, and jump went to
Quick, versatile Fiji, last year.
Up-degraff in Quarter

Quarter mile race, longest of the
afternoons events, will be a ques-
tion mark. Both of last year’s main
contenders, Davis of Phi Epsilon
Pi and Cusick of Phi Kappa, will
not be back. Third place runner
Howard Updegraﬁ should have an
easy time of it, although a dark
horse entry might come through
with the event title.

Summing up the day’s events, Phi
Gamma Delta, Phi Delta Theta,
and Delta Tau Delta should carry
away the lion’s share of the awards.
Edgar Jones, if he is able to run,
and Bobby Thurbon should be
standout individual stars of the IF
track meet.

Pitt Golf Team
Set for Tartan
F racasToda_y

Carnegie Tech’s amazing golfers,
winners of their ﬁrst three matches
this year, are about to revert back
to Tartan type. This alternoon the
Skibo swingers match strokes with
Pitt’s Panthers, and despite the
neat record Tech has compiled this

year, a glance at the result of last‘

Pitt’s golf team scored its ﬁrst
victory of the year Friday, a 5-4
win over Cornell at Alcoma. Bob
Walkinshaw, number six Pan-

ther, shot a. medal 74 to take the '

deciding match, 7 and 6.

year’s Pitt—Tech encounter proves
a ‘Tech victory today very improb-
able. '

The dampener to Tartan hopes is
just this: ﬁve of their six starters
this afternoon were caught in the
9-0 rout that marked Pitt’s most
decisive 1940 victory.

Lead man for Carnegie is Cap-
tain Jack Ellen, only man to give
his Pitt opponent a ﬁght last year.
Ellen chalked up a 78 before drop-
ping his match to Homer McClin-
tock in an extra hole. But no other
Tartan broke 85.

The Panther lineup shows Bill
Kramer and Bob Seybold still hold-
ing their two year lease on the ﬁrst
two spots; Harry Simpson, who
scored a sub-par 70 against Slip-
pery Rock, playing at number 3;
and Jack Glenn, Jim Butcher, and
Bob Jones holding down the last
three positions.

Pilgrim, Metcalfe
To Begin Graduate

Work at Wisconsin

Francis J. Pilgrim, C41, and Har-
old Clark Metcalfe, C41, two of
this year’s graduates of chemistry,
have been appointed to positions as
graduate students in chemistry for
the coming year at the University
of Wisconsin and at Cornell univer-
sity.

In addition the chemistry depart-
ment announced that several for-
mer graduates of the department
were holding teaching and research
positions at various universities.
Dr. Elliott W. Montroll, who ob-
tained his doctor of philosophy de-
gree in chemistry from the Univer-
sity, now holds the Sterling fellow-
ship at Yale and has been reap-
pointed for another year.

F. H. Max Nestler, Jr., ’40, who
holds a graduate assistantship at
Yale has been reappointed to his
post by the Yale chemistry depart-
ment, and Fred T. Fiedorek, ’40,
who now holds a graduate assist-
ant’s post at Cornell has been ap-
pointed to a research fellowship on

Team Defeats

Grove City, 6-3

After missing in its ﬁrst txvo at-
tempts, Pitts rejuvenated tennis
team has snapped into a winning
streak, chalking up its second vic-
t01‘Y in as many days by downing
Grove City College, 5-3, at Trees
ﬁeld. last Thursday.

The Panthers took the match via
the doubles route. At the end of
the singles encounters, the score was
deadlocked at three all. Ed Goehr-
ing. Panther captain, defeated Mc-
Cl-OSKEY. Trimble. second, and
G391“-.5-‘.91’. ‘fflird. vrere beaten by
Hulton and Steak, Nickeson topped
Weidler, and Jordon bowed to Mc-
Dowell to set up the tie preceding
the doubles matches.

Then, with Pitt’s revised doubles
team setup, made necessary by the
early season losing streak, the
Panther racquet wielders proceeded
to trounce the Grovers in the last
three matches.

Winning combination had Goehr-
ing teamed with Wynn to down Mc-
Closkey and Steck, Trimble and
Grance taking care of Hulton and
McC1oskey, and Gaenger and Reese
defeating McDowell and Towle.
Only two sets were required for
each of the doubles victories.

The Panther netmen will be try-
ing to make it three straight, when
they meet Army, next Wednesday,
on the West Point courts.

Stained Glass
Medallion Gift

All Members Asked
For $1 Contributions

After deliberating for several
weeks, senior memorial committee
has chosen as the gift from the class
of ’41 a stained glass medallion to
be installed in the Forbes-Bigelow
corner window on the ﬁrst ﬂoor of
the Cathedral.

Funds for the window will be
raised by individual contributions
from the senior class, according to
T. J. Lewis, C41, and D. A. Car-
rier, Ed42, co-chairmen of the com-
mittee. ‘The goal has been set at a
minimum of $1 from each member.
A letter has been circulated in-
forming the seniors of the selection
and explaining the method by which
the funds will be raised. Included
in the letter was a pledge card for
those who wished to defer the pay-
ment until some later date. Those
wishing to contribute immediately
were instructed to send their
money to the dean of men’s office.

The money will be solicited from
the ca-p and gown deposits which
each senior has made. Five dol-
lars of the original $6.50 deposit
will be returned to each member
of the class, and one dollar will be

If the drive is successful, the me-
dallion will only be the second re-
cent gift genuinely -donated to the
school. In past years, excluding
last year when the class of ’40 also
donated a window placed overlook-
ing Lilly court, sufﬁcient funds were
never successfully raised. The gift
of ’39, a ﬂagpole, was never erected.

“The medallion, I believe, will be
a very distinctive gift. It will al-
ways be here as long as the Cathe-

+ dral will be here, and it certainly is

in keeping with the Gothic archi-
tecture of the building,” Lewis
stated.

have to stop ‘taking in boarders.’ ”

More silent on the issue is the
other fraternity affected by the old
zoning ordinance, Sigma Alpha Mu
which, it is reported, haslhad its
case in court for a long while, since
ultimate decision does, not rest
with the city zoning board. Sigma
Alpha Mu’s case is a peculiar one,
for the zoning line dividing class B
from class A zone runs through its
property. Said Henry Nemrod,
BA42, Sigma Alpha Mu president,
“Our lawyer told me to make no
statement.”

Hughes explained that objection
to the rezoning proposal came from
residents living in the vicinity of
Neville street because class B zones
do not permit boarding houses, hos-
pitals, or multiple family dwellings,
thereby “providing a bulwark
against jeopardizing the Shadyside
district.”

Also situated in the class B zone.
is Phi Gamma Delta fraternity. But
this house is not affected by the city
ordinance since it was established
before the ordinance went into ef-
fect.

Phi Epsilon Pi is located on Nev-
ille street but is also unaffected. It
is situated beyond Wallingford
street and in a class A zone.

Jacobson Discusses
Expansion of Schools

Shortage of machines and other
equipment, and lack of space and
qualiﬁed teachers are the most seri-
ous problems facing the public
schools in any contemplated expan-
sion.

That is the opinion of Dr. E. W.
Jacobsen, dean of the School of Ed-
ucation, who has just returned after
making the 1941 occupational edu-
cation tour with 15 school superin-
tendents and oﬂicials who started
in Los Angeles, Cal., on April 14,
and concluded their tour in Seattle,
Wash., on April 22.

Financed by Carnegie

Financed by a grant from the
Carnegie Corporation of New York,
these annual meetings and t-ours
have done much toward making
possible the present national de-
tense job-training program which
in the past 10 months has provided
industry with more than a half
million defense production workers.

In many localities, Dr. Jacobsen
said, the defense training job is al-
ready on a 24-hour basis. Any
school system which has lagged does
not fully realize the gravity of the
program of defense activity that lies
ahead.

Public Schools and Defense

The officials said, following the
tour, that they believe American
public schools must go “all-out”
immediately in training w0r_kcrs for
defense jobs. School systems must
not wait for factories and ship-
yards to be built before they start
training men and women for nation-
al defense industries. School ad-
ministration must anticipate imme-
diate and iuture needs.

The group concluded that lack of
machinery must not cause school
superintendents to delay. Pro-
grams can be started despite this
handicap. Even without machines
there -can ‘be preliminary training.
Every available machine should be
placed in use immediately in public
school vocational shops.

Pitt Students Ask Chancellor About Union Plans;
But Iowa Undergraduates Ask, Act, and Build

[Editor’s Note: Following is the
fourth of a series of articles on stu-
dent unions by staﬁ‘ writer Fred
Lange. Subsequent articles will ex-
plain the purpose of student unions;
and if, how, when Pitt will have a
student union.]

Some Pitt students wanted a stu-
dent union building so they asked
the Chancellor if the University had
done anything about it, and he told
them of a plan, dormant for nearly
10 years.

Students at the University of Iowa
also wanted a student union, but
they did not just ask what the ad-
min’stration would do about it—
they did something themselves.

During the ﬁrst summer of the
campaign, hundreds of students
went home. Their homes were
scattered in towns all over the state,
towns in which University alumni
were living.

When the new term began in
September, students and alumni
wanted a union building.

While Iowa students worked at
the university to instill the spirit

in the incoming freshmen, the alum-
ni were also busy. They worked
with prosperous business men in
their community. During the next
vacation, students helped convince
business men that Iowa needed a
union.

When classes resumed, students,
alumni, and business men wanted
a student union.

Business men had friends, alumni
had friends, and students had rela-
tions.

“Iowa needs a union, Iowa will
have a union. Would you like to
help build it?” friends and relations
were asked.

The new semester began at Iowa
and students, alumni, business men,
friends, relations wanted a student
union.

Then the campaign directors be-
gan to get a heavy mail. Sub-
scriptions, checks, money orders,
cash was found in the envelopes.
Students procured more funds by
direct contact. The faculty con-
tributed, fraternities contributed,
activities, organizations contributed.

Exhibition of Old Pittsburgh
Portrayed by Prints, Painting

. By ANITA PAT BARONE

A collection of prints, paintings, pottery,

and glassware all originat-

ing from old Pittsburgh, will constitute the last exhibit of the year in the
ﬁne arts gallery on the seventh ﬂoor.

The exhibit opens today and will continue until June 7.

Two C&G Clubs
Elect, Tap 16

Charles Sarber, C42, three year
chorus veteran of Cap and Gown,
was elected president of the Under-
graduate Cap and Gown club at a
meeting Friday afternoon and suc-
ceeds Edwin Trembath, BA41, re-
tiring president.

As vice-president and social
chairman the undergraduate club
members selected Sigmund Edel-
man, BA42, also a three-year man
for the chorus. Howard Hanna,
B-A42, a member of the production
staff, was elected secretary-treas-
urer.

Plans for the annual luncheon and
picnic of the club were discussed
at the meeting, the ﬁnal business
session of the year.

The following men have been
tapped to the Graduate Ca-p and
Gown club, according to Theodore
W. Biddle, assistant to the dean of
men and graduate manager of the
group: Roy Baldwin, C42; Harold
Goltsman, C41; Edward Hufnagle,
Ed42; E. ‘Seymour Kerber, C41;
Richard Lambie, C42; Alvin Lud-
wig, BA41; Frank Mateer, C41;
Seymour Perlut, P41; William Rial,
E41; Martin Schlesinger, C41; Oscar

Sheﬂer, C41; Irving Stapsy, C41;
Thomas Stephenson, BA41; Gene
Te-dick, C41; Edwin Trembath,

BA4l; and Dave Tucker, C41.

Perhaps the most interesting part
of the exhibit is the section of glass-
ware. There are examples from the
different glass companies of Pitts-
burgh showing the various pat-
terns used in the manufacture of
old pressed glassware. There are
the hobnail and fantop patterns, the
wildﬂower, and the horseshoe, and
a complete glassware set in the pine
and deer pattern. The dates of
this glassware range from 1850 to
the 1870’s.

Between the prints and the paint-
ings in the exhibit there is a com-
plete record of Pittsburgh from
1754 up to the present day show-
ing the development and growth
of the city.

Particularly interesting among
the pottery is the Staffordshire plate
made in England with a picture of
the Old Western Pennsylvania pen-
itentiary painted on it.

Th-ere is a print of George Wash-
ington on his way to Pittsburgh, a
reproduction of the ﬁrst directory of
Pittsburgh, and an iron ﬁre marker
that identiﬁed a house as being pro-
tected by a particular ﬁre company,
early maps of this area, prints from
Harper’s weekly, paintings by John
Kane, and loads of other things that
are pe-culiar and interesting.

Tomorrow night in conjunction
with the exhibit Miss Katherine
Miller, who has loaned many of the
features of her own collection of
early Pittsburgh items to the Uni-
versity, will lecture in the ﬁne arts
Library at 8:30 o’clock in the even-

ing. The public is invited to attend.

$600,000 collected was subscribed
by students and today the Univer-
sity of Iowa has a student union
building, one of the most beautiful
in the country.

Alumni and students raised half
of the $400,000 fund used to build
the California union; at Utah $70,000
was raised from students and $20,-
000 from faculty. Wisconsin,
Washington, Vermont, Purdue,
Michigan—all solicited students to
get union funds, and all have stu-
dent unions today.

But all studen-ts unions were not
built from student contributed
funds. Toronto’s Hart house was
the gift of one family, and Huston
hall at the University of Pennsyl-
vania was built from a single do-
nation. Bates, Cornell, and McGill,
built unions from sums given for
that purpose by individuals.

At Brown the YMCA raised half
the money for the union, and John
D. Rockefeller offered to build the
union after an additional endow-
ment had been raised.

The state legislature appropriated
the money for the Ohio union at
Ohio State.

Life memberships in unions are
a method of collecting funds. They
sell for $40 to $100, depending upon
the regulations of the union cam-
paign. Alumni and residents of
the towns in which the colleges are
located receive subscriptions for
life membership.

In some colleges, alumni and
sometimes students are solicited
periodically to obtain life members.

[The next article will deal with
union possibilities at Pitt.]
