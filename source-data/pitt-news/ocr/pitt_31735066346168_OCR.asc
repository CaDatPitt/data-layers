Pitt Money Must Clear House

Appropriation Delayed

by RON LOZOWSKI

The second half of the Uni-
versity's state appropriation
for the 1970-71 fiscal year is
being delayed in Harrisburg.

Senate Bill 575, allotting ap-
proximately $19 million to Pitt.
has already passed the Senate.
but has yet to be approved by the
House.

According to Russ Arnold. di-
rector of Governmental Relations
here. one possible reason for the
delay is that the bill requires a
two-thirds vote of the House:
may simply not be enough votes
to insure passage. Arnold pointed
out that a two-thirds vote would
require the support of most
House Democrats. as well as
some Republicans.

POLITICAL FEUD?

Arnold also suggested the pre-
sence of a conflict between Gov-
ernor Shapp and Philadelphia
Democrats in the House. A month
ago. Shapp supported Congress-
man William Green, an indepen-
dent candidate for mayor of
Philadelphia. antagonizing Phila-

delphia Democrats who favored I

Frank Rizzo the eventual vict.or.

A third possibility mentioned by
Arnold was that the House might
assign priority to an appropria-
tion for funds to operate the reg-
ular governmental machinery
rather. than appropriations to
higher education.

Arnold cited a combination of
two or more factors is probably

the cause of the delay. “At this
point we don’t know where the im-
passe is. We’re trying to find
out,” he stated.

House Appropriations Commit-
tee Chairman Martin Mullen of
Philadelphia offered a more def-
inite explanation. Mullen said the
House Republicans will not let the
bill pass "until after we adopt the
general fund budget for the next
fiscal period.“

ARNOLD: Seeks cause of impasse.

Mullen further explained that
until the general budget is adopt-
ed. it will not be possible to ob-
tain the necessary two-thirds ma-
jori.ty for the University appro-
priation. ,

He said, however, that he did
not foresee any difficulty in pass-

Shapp Plans 1 Student

Trustee Appointments

by POHLA SMITH
News Editor

Governor Milton Shapp plans to H

appoint a student to the Board of
Trustees of each of the three
state—related universities.

John Pittinger. legislative sec-
retary. explained the Governors
decision.

“The Governor thinks students
and young alumni are affected by
decisions made by the trustees
and therefore ought to have rep-
resentation on the board.“

Pittinger said one student will
be appointed to each board of
Pennsylvania State University,
Temple University, and the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh as a vacancy
occurs. There will be a seat va-
cant on Pitt’s Board in October.

The Governor has contacted
student leaders at each of the
three schools. He has asked that a
responsible group of students.
such as a student government.
nominate five students as possible
trustees and that the list of names
be submitted by July 1.

The Governor will make his ap-
pointment from the list of nom-

inations. submitting the name to -

the State Senate for approval.

Pittinger said the guidelines
suggested by Governor Shapp are
very general. The student can be
either an undergraduate or a
graduate.

Pittinger said he was unsure
whether the State Senate would
oppose the Governor's student ap-
pointments. "I just haven‘t talked
to enough Senators to see how
they feel." he said.

Dennis Concilla. Student Asso-
ciation Programs Commissioner.
said that the Student Affairs Ad-
visory Committee will choose the
five nominees from Pitt.

Members of the committee in-
clude: the SA Commissioners-
Wade Lawson, Dennis Concilla,
Lenny Klavonic and Ted Michalik;
the editor of the Pitt News—Bill
Gormley; the president of Wom-
en's Housing .Board—Judy Mc-
Laughlin; and the president of the
Men’s Dormitory Council — Ken
Krenicky. _

Also on the Council are Paul
Symczak — president. Inter-Fra-
ternity Council; Mary Jane Trun-
zo-president. Pan-Hellenic Coun-
cilz Gordon Percy—chairman of
the General Studies Cabinet: Tom
Gainanwpresident of the Commu-
ter Association; Richard Utley~—
president. Black Action Society;
Cathi Ritts — president. Associ-
ated Women Students; and Ray
Kenny—-president. Men's Council.

Concilla said the committee will
be accepting applications and

nominations. He also said they
would prefer a student who plans
to be in Pittsburgh during the
next three years.

 

 

ing the bill, once the prelimin-
ary measures are carried out; he
added he hopes to have the bill
voted upon sometime during the
next two weeks.

Two smaller bills are also be-
ing delayed in passage. Senate
Bill 602. appropriating $1.375
million to the Western Psychia-
tric Institute and Clinic (WPIC).
has already passed the Senate and
is awaiting action in the House.
Also. a bill for $60.000 (Senate
‘Bill 690) to provide for the Salk
Professorship has been intro-
duced in the Senate by State Sen-
ators Thomas Lamb and Robert
Fleming. This bill has not yet left
the Senate Appropriations Com-
mittee.

NEW FISCAL YEAR

Regarding the 1971-72 appro-
priations. the Chancellor had re-
quested $49 million. in contrast to
the Governor's recommendation
for $43.2 million. The requests
have already been presented to
the House. but the date for the
Senate presentation has not yet
been set. Arnold lamented the
fact that not even an approximate
date has been set: “We can't even
get an estimate."

The Governors recommenda-
tion provides for a slight increase
(about $4 million) over 1970-71.
The ‘70-71 allotment had been ap-
proximately the same amount re-
ceived the previous year.

Amount Not Yet Decided

State Budget Makes  
Tuition Raise Likely

by POHLA SMITH
News Editor

Students at the University again
face the likelihood of a tuition in-
crease.

In a letter to all students dated
June 21. Chancellor Posvar an-
nounced that a tuition hike was
likely. though the amount has not
been decided upon. ’

The Chancellor said the raise
was necessitated by a reluctance
on the part of the Commonwealth
to increase its aid to the Univer-
sity. despite increased enrollment
and services by the University.

The State has also been tardy
in transmitting funds already al-
located to the University, forcing
Pitt to borrow money at high in- _
terest rates. For these two rea-
sons, the University anticipates a
$1.8 million deficit this fiscal
year.

Although the State Department
of Education has justified a bud-
get of $55.6 million for Pitt. the
Governor has recommended only
$43.2 million in his budget pro-
posals.

The Chancellor said
though the University could op-
erate on less than the amount
recommended by the State De-
partment of Education. it could
not function on the lesser amount

Board Urges Aid To Private Colleges

that ..

without obtaining extra funds
through a tuition hike.

Another cause of the tuition
raise is pressure on the part of

the Commonwealth to equalize‘

tuition at the three state-related
universities. Some State legisla-
tors advocate a tuition price of

$970 for two terms. the rate cur- if 

rently charged at Temple Univer-
sity. The State Master Plan for
Higher Education has called for

a price of $1.000. which would

mean an increase of over $150 for
Pitt students.

A University official who pre-

ferred to remain. anonymous ‘hast 

speculated that the University
will probably settle on a tuition
cost similar to Temple Universi-
ty’s $970. He also said that the
final decision is being delayed un-
til budget hearings are held in
Harrisburg. 2‘

In his opinion.a final decision on
the tuition increase would prob-
ably negate any possibilities of
the State‘s increasing its aid to
Pitt. However. if the budget hear-
ings are delayed for too long. say
until nearly time for invoicing. the
University will have to reach a

decision without knowing its State , 

allocations for the 1971-72 fiscal
year.

  Tuition Parity Plotted

The State Board of Education
has recommended that tuition at
Pennsylvania's State-related uni-
versities be increased to $1.000
per year “as rapidly as feasible."

In an updated Master Plan for
Higher Education. the Board pro-
posed that tuition at Pitt and Tem-
pley should eventually be hiked
annually’ "by amounts relative to
the increase in the national level
of per capita disposable income.“

The Master Plan will soon be
considered by the education com-
mittees of the State House and
Senate. which may recommend
enacting portions of the Plan into
law.

Perhaps most importantly, the
Board proposed methods 03 aiding
Pennsylvania's ailing private col-
leges and universitiles, including:

1) Indirect aid through expanded
student scholarships and loans;

2) Direct aid through interest-
free loans for educational fa-
cilities; and

3) Direct aid through contractual
arrangements for support of
particular programs.

The Master Plan did not specify
what types of programs might be
supported by the State govern-
ment. It did. however. suggest
that the States scholarship maxi-
mum and family income ceiling
be raised "so that the independent
segment may be somewhat reliev-
ed of the burden of financing stu-
dent aid."

 

Although the Board noted the
importance of “preserving the
character of the independent col-
lege and universities,” it warned
that “the acceptance of public
funds by independent institutions
will carry with it the responsi-
bility for public accountability for
the expenditure of these funds.

Urging that "particular em-
phasis“ be placed on "providing
avenues for educational and so-
cial mobility for disadvantaged
groups." the Board suggested the
launching of a “massive program to
correct a serious imbalance in the
availability of higher education
for disadvantaged students.“

To alleviate the plight of the
underprivileged. the Board recom-
mended:

1: Remedial and compensatory
programs:

2) The "conscious" recrument of
disadvantaged youth:

3) A re-examination of the entire
admissions process:

4) Financial aid to students and in-
stitutions to support services
for disadvantaged students:
and

5) Improved counseling for the

disadvantaged in both high school

and college.

The Board also urged the States
colleges and universities to estab-
lish or improve service programs.
"perhaps by conducting a share
of these operations through appro-
priate neighborhood facilities."

 

r 

In addition, the Board proposed . «

the eventual elimination of the
State's senatorial scholarship pro-
gram, terming the program “in-
compatible with the principle of
need as employed by the Pennsyl-
vania Higher Education Assis-
tance Agency.

ltﬁ also suggested that the
State's scholarship program
should be restricted to "Pennsyl-
vania residents entering or trans-
ferring to Pennsylvania institu-
tions except where reciprocity
arrangements are in effect with
other states." Pennsylvania stu-
dents currently attending schools
outside Pennsylvania would‘ not
be affected.

The Board said the State should
consider the possibility‘ of an "ad-
missions clearinghouse" for all

Pennsylvania institutions of high- 

er learning. and said that defer-
red tuition payment plans." such
as that adopted at Yale. should
also be considered.

Emphasizing that state‘ govern-
ment. like the State's colleges
and universities. is plaguedby
financial problems. the Board
recommended that “all‘institu-
tions-—public and independent—
should immediately undertake

 

rigorous self-examination to as- 

sure efficient internal ‘operation
and a minimum of duplication in

curricula among neighboring in- V

stitutions."

A W Meeting Aborted

UCWR Raps Secrecy

by SUE HOENSTINE
An attempt by members of

the University Committee for Wom-

en’s Rights <UCWRi to meet with
representatives from the Depart-
ment of Health. Education and
Welfare <HEWi ended in a stale-
mate Thursday.

The women were to meet with
Rose Brock and Frank Harney.
representatives of the HEW of-
fice of Federal Contract Compli-
ance. to learn the -results of
HEW‘s investigation of the al-
leged firing. intimidation and har-
assment by University officials
of UCWR members.

In April members of the UCWR
had_demonstrated at Pitt con-
cerning the treatment of nine of
its leaders.

Hall Dedication Honors

Following the demonstration,
HEW sent investigators to Pitt to
study the alleged cases of harass-
ment.

Rose Brock and Frank Harney
agreed to meet with the nine com-
plainants at 4 p.m. in the Civic
(Jenter Motor Lodge.

The women requested a meet-
ing open to the news media with
the HEW representatives and the
University administration on Fri-
day.

Harney and Brock explained
that they were under orders from
HEW to present the findings in
private, separate meetings with
the complainants and the Univer-
sity.

David L. Lawrence

The Common Facilities Build-
ing formally acquired a new name
June 17, as local dignitaries
gathered to dedicate Lawrence
Hall and pay tribute to the late
David L. Lawrence, former Mayor
of Pittsburgh, Governor of Penn-
sylvania. and co-architect of the
Pittsburgh Renaissance.

Chancellor Wesley Posvar. dress-

ed in a cap and gown, opened the
ceremony by lauding Lawrence for
his service as a Pitt Trustee for
two decades. “Under Lawrence's
leadership." Posvar added,
"Pennsylvania began to shoulder
its responsibilities in higher edu-

When the press was refused en-
trance to the session. about 30
members of the UCWR walked out
of the motel rom. Only two of the
complainants agreet to receive
their letters concerning Hl1jW's
investigation.

“The whole process of this_in-
vestigation is a denial of justice
and due process." Jo Ann (lard-
ner. a UCWR complaintant. said
later in the motel parking lot. "We
have nothing to hide. Anything
that went on in that meeting we
wanted the public to know about."
she continued. "The idea of meet-
ing in a hotel room is undignified
and not due process."

Dr. Ina Braden, past president
of the UCWR and a complaintant,
argued that the presentation of
an honorary degree to HEW Sec-
retary Elliot Richardson by the
University may have affected the
outcome of the investigation.

“Not only our jobs. but people's
lives all over the country have
been threatened. Richardson ac-
cepted his degreegwhile the in-
vestigation was still on. but while
he was in Pittsburgh he couldn‘t
meet with us (UCWRl." Braden
said.

‘‘If HEW’s a paper tiger, why
should we deal with them at this
point?” Braden concluded.

Dave Powers. assistant to the
Chancellor. assured the Pitt News
that Brock and Harney did not
meet with the administration on
Friday as scheduled. He did re-
port that HEW officials said they
would send letters concerning the

investigation to the complainants.

Q Beards’ Outlaivied, Sideburns Trimmed

Dental School Controls
Dress, Stresses Hygiene

by EVAN‘ PATTAK
Associate Editor

The School of Dental Medicine
has adopted a new code regulat-
ing student appearance and con-
duct.

The code prohibits dental stu-
dents from wearing beards and
limits the length of hair. side-
burns and mustaches. It also es-
tablishes guidelines for dress and
conduct of student dental assis-
tants and hygienists.

The seven-member Ethics Com-
mittee of the School wrote the
new policy. Committee members
include three faculty representa-
tives. three class presidents from
the School and a representative of
the Dental Assistance Oral Hy-
giene Program.

Dr. Robert Mundell, a faculty
member of the committee, said
that the new guidelines were nec-
essary to clear up “areas of con-
flict” about what students could
or couldn’t war or do. He said that
previous regulations, written in
the Clinic Manual issued all stu-
dents, were-vagueand incomplete.

Late last winter, first—_year
dental student Robert Maier was
suspended from the School. al-
legedly because of his long hair.
Maier maintained that he was
violating no rules of the School.

Explaining Maier‘s suspension.
Dean Forest of the School of Den-
tal ' Medicine said: "Since
most of our. patients are volun-

 

 

tary. we cannot afford to alienate
them due to a students appear-
ance. It would deprive our stu-
dents of their much needed prac-
tical experience." (Long Hair.
Cause for Expulsion? Pitt News,
March 15.: Maier eventually
transferred to the College of Arts
and Sciences.

“New guidelines are necessary
because of the nature of clinical
work,” Mundell said. “No one
has any objections to what stu-
dents wear outside the Clinic
area.” , ~

Mundell said that the public‘s
stereotyped image of dentists re-
quires dental students to dress
and act accordingly.

"The dentist is always pictured
as having a thin mustache. white
fingernails and clean-smelling
breath." he said.

Tony Stakis, president of the
sophomore class and member of
the Ethics Committee, said that
he saw “. . . nothing wrong with
determining an individual’s pro-
fessionalism.”

"We must cater to the people
who come intolthe Clinic." said
Stakis. "We have to rely on the
patients.“

The new code states that "per-
sonal grooming . . . should not only
reflect habits of cleanliness but
should avoid any departure from the
conventions of a professional
school." Specifically. dental stu-
dents‘-must:

In addition, students are en-
couraged to wash frequently and
develop habits of personal hy-
gience and are forbidden to work
in the Outpatient Department
while under the influence of al-
cohol or drugs. “Students,"
the code says, “are expected to
conduct themselves as ladiesand

pus and off."

Student dental assistants and
hygienists. frequently women.
must wear their uniforms no
higher. than the tops of their

wearing pants uniforms may not
wear V-neck tops. colored under-
clothes or bikini underpants.

Mundell and Stakis said that
some dental students were com-
plying with the limitations on long
hair by wearing short-hair wigs
while working in the clinic.

To the relief of Pitt's Nervous
Nellies. the Master Plan for
Higher Education addresses it-
self to the plight of Pennsylvan-
ia's private colleges and univer-
sities. without gravely threaten-

ing Pitt. Penn State. and Tem- .

ple.

The Master Plan. which will
soon. be. considered by the State
Legislatures two education com-
mittees. recommends new forms

of assistance to Pennsylvania's

ailing private institutions. but
also urges the continuation of
institutional aid to Pitt. Penn
State." and Temple.

To.,the dismay of the state- '

related institutions, the Master

’ Plan urges that tuition at Pitt

and Temple be hiked to $1,000
per year. And, according to a re-
cent letter from Chancellor Pos-
var, tuition here may indeed be
increased shortly to near that
amount.

The Master Plan also recom-
mends. however. that the Penn-
sylvania Higher Education As-
sistance Agency scholarship ceil-
ing be raised beyond the current

acted by the State Legislature.
this provision would soften the
blow of a tuition raise for needy
Pitt and Temple students.

Unfortunately. the Master
Plan indicates only a passing
interest in the quality of educa-
tional services offered through-
out the state. and this is a ser-
ious flaw.

The State Board of Education.
which drafted the Plan. claims to

“,4 passing interest in

the State Legislature. is likely
to hurt colleges that place a
premium on quality.

Although the Master Plan
does not contain an explicit re-
ference to the formula. the ab-
sence has been termed "merely
an oversight" by an informed
observer. '

The formula embraced by the

be concerned with “both the
variety and quality of "educa-
tional opportunities available."

The Master Plan does not,
however, suggest any provisions
which might ensure that a uni-
versity’s commitment to effi-
ciency does not surpass its com-
mitment to quality.

In fact. the Board of Education
is in favor of a formula for de-
termining allocations to the
state's institutions of higher
learning which. if adopted by

hour ratio and penalizes those
which have a high one. In
short. universities which crowd
students into large lecture halls
will receive more money from
the state than those which pro-
vide more seminars.

Such a formula is likely to
prove detrimental to higher edu-
cation in Pennsylvania. as it will
discourage the intimate dialogue
of seminars. If a university suc-
cumbs ‘to temptation and opts
for lectures. its students suffer;
if it doesn't, the university suf-

fers. and its students suffer too
—— clearly. a Hobson's choice.

By the large, the Master Plan
is commendable.

It recognizes the acute need
for providing equal educational
opportunities for the disadvan-
taged and sugge

It also urges the abolition of
senatorial scholarships — politi-
cal plums which are awarded to
students without regard to fin-
ancial need. — an ugly relic of a
less innocent past.

Commendably. the Master
Plan suggests that the possibili-
ty of open admissions in Penn-
sylvania should be discussed.
And it mentions tuition defer-
ment plans and the establishment
of an admissions clearinghouse
as future possibilities.

The Board deserves applause
for grappling with the desper-
ate problems of the state's private
colleges and universities. It will
be unfortunate. however. if ’ the

Plan Envisions Private College Aid\

The Dental School
Sets a Dress Code

by BOB BONN .
I Opinion Editor‘ ' r 2 V  J
You know, if there‘s one disgusting thing in this
world. it's a female dentist who wears colored underwear
under her pants uniform. Right? ' '

Maybe not, but according to the Ethics Committee
of Pius Dental School. it ranks. In a six-page classic en-
titled “Student Appearance and Conduct." the committee
set forth a detailed code for all dent students.

Realizing that it is important for a dentist to maintain
a neatand socially acceptable appearance while on duty.
the rules prohibit sideburns that extend below the bottom
of the earlobe. mustaches that go below the lipline of the
upper lip. and eye shadow.

Thggleaflet opens up a wealth of questions for an
inquisitive reader or a lecherous patient. How would one
of the professors know for sure if a girl is wearing color-
ed underwear? Or bikini-type underwear? Perhaps a re-
visitation of “Pretty Maids All In A Row". with the as-

sistant principal providing "guidance on a sofa behind
closed doors? l

Other parts of the edict do make sense. The section
on personal hygiene is an example. Who would go to a
dentist with dirty paws? And it's nice to know that the
Dental School encourages the use of underarm deodorant.

All in all, it is the feeling of this writer and critic
that the Dental School deserves commendation for its
work on personal regulations. f‘Student Appearance And
Conduct" makes for very interesting reading. and saves
the student all the trouble of learning good grooming by
experience.

It proves that, in the Dental School, a word to the
wise is not sufficient. So something up there reminds me
of a high school——the administration treats the students
like children by giving them clear and explicit directions.
and the students raise no objections. ‘

‘But since it’s in the name of professionalism. it doesn‘t
matter. Just use discretion when buying _undergarments.

Expansion Enhances Power

by GLENN SHAW
Special to the Pitt News

There has been a great deal of
discontent in Oakland lately
about the University‘s expan-
sion plans. A group called Peo-
ple‘s Oakland has been formed

' toloppose the new Hillside Dor-

mitory project.

Quite a few signs are display-
ed saying "This house is not for
sale to Pitt." Why does the Uni-
versity feel that it is necessary
to expand. especially in the face
of such consternation on the
part of its neighbors‘?

The Forbes Field Project and
the block south of Forbes Ave-
nue between Bouquet Street and
Oakland Avenue are to be used
to relieve the overcrowding of
the Cathedral of Learning.

Never mind that Forbes Field
could be used for parking or a
playground, and never mind that
several businesses and residents
are being moved from  the
block, never mind that the
size of the Falk School’s play-
ground will be cut in half. All

$12 Fee:

Editor:

I read in the June 8 edition of
the Pitt News that the Student
Association Commissioners have
voted to request a $4 boost in
the Activities Fee for the Fall
term. I would like to express to
you my firm opposition to any
increase in the Activities Fee.
and to the Activities Fee itself.

Perhaps at one time an activi-
ties fee was an equitable manner
in which to provide a variety of

, activities for Pitt students eager

to participate in them. But this
day passed long ago. Only a very
small minority——a tiny frac-tion—
of students take part in activities
today.

The vast maj_ority of students
could care less about the exis-
tence of any activities. The Ac-
tivities Fee is an obsolete tax

on many forbthe .bcnje_‘fit pf2_ver=,y_.,;

very few. Ali increase ‘in’-‘the Ac-

of these things are unimportant
compared to easing the crowd-
ing in the Cathedral and pro-
viding more dormitory space.

Well. we've heard all the rea-
sons why these, projects are un-
derway. but we haven‘t heard
why they are necessary. An ans-
wer that the administrators seem
to ignore is that if the school is
overcrowded. don't accept so
many students. Rather than ex-
pand the physical plant. shrink
the personnel!

Such a suggestion is certain
to bring cries of “You don't care
about the education of our
young people! Pitt has a respon-
sibility to educate as many
young people as it can! "

Yes, but it is trying to educate
more than it can.

If it were located in a subur-
ban or rural setting. the room
for expansion would be availa-
ble. But when a large univer-
sity. already cramped in an ur-
ban area. reaches out like an
octopus to grab chunks of land
from the people who live there.

tivities Fee would be an out-
rage.

Of course my opposition to the
Activities Fee is not to be mis-
taken as opposition to student
activities. Anyone should. be
free to meet any place at any
time. as long as their functions
are supported by voluntary fees,
dues or charges.

If the present $8 fee must be
retained. student organizations
should be told to find additional
income by voluntary methods.
If the fee is increased to $12,
those who do not take part in
activities should be exempted
from the fee.

There are many methods of
compromise that could be work-
ed out with the present system.
Any increase in the fee would.
however. be an unthinkable act
of theft.

Douglas R. Stanton
Law. '74

we have to ask why. ,

Psychologist Eric Fromm has
the answer. In discussing the
reason for the rise of the giant
corporation (and the university
is a corporation, too), he begins
with the separation of ownership
and management. The large cor-
poration is owned by a multi-
tude of stockholders, but is man-
aged by professionals.

Since they don't own the
business. making a profit is not
their principal concern. . They
would much rather expand their
company and merge with other
companies so that their own
power is enhanced.

And such is the situation with
university administrators.

Therefore. the administrators
spend a lot of effort upon ex-
panding the size of their insti-
tutions rather than improving the
quality.

Hopefully. the administration
at Pitt will realize that it has

fallen into this way of thinking. A

and pull itself out.

4 questions

1. Are you a graduating
senior majoring in science,
engineering, agriculture or
business?

2. Are you graduating with

a degree in liberal arts,

with summer experience in

such skills as farming,
construction, business or
public health?

3. Are you willing and able

to acquire a working
. knowledge of a foreign

language if given the
 _ proper training?

4.. Do you have a genuine
" desire to work in partner-
7ship with people in other

parts of the world?

If your answers to one of

the first two questions and
~- both. of the last two ques-

 

tracksters didn't seem that bad
to those involved.

“I think it was a good show-
ing for us,” said assistant coach
Dennis Johnson. Bill Rea had
an excellent performance for a
freshman, Dan Kouvolo topped
off his four-year career with a
real good performance, and
Mike Schurko just missed scor-
ing by one place.”

Actually. the Pitt athletes
would have fared better had the
trials been the finals instead.

In the trials. Rea long jumped
25 feet. 10l2 inches. This was his
best jumpt to date. His best pre-
vious jump was 25 feet. 91/2 inch-
es two weeks ago in the IC4A‘s.
However. Rea managed only a
24 feet. 10 inch jump in the t'iii-
als for a fifth place finish. and
two of Pitt's four points.

The winning distance was 25
feet. 912 inches.

In the 3000 meter steeple-
chase. Schurko met the same
fate as did Rea. Schurko ran the
third best qualifying time but
faded in the finals to seventh.
In the finals Scurko ran the
3000 meters in 8254.0. which was
six seconds slower than his trials
time.

Dan Kouvolo accounted for
Pitt’s other two points with his

fifth place finish in the javelin
throw. Kouvolo bettered his
trials throw in the finals, but
only by three feet. In the finals
he heaved the javelin 242 feet.

"We just sent the guys who
qualifed over to" give them a
chance and see what they could
do. Schurko has ‘another year
and Rea is only a freshman and
I think the trip helped them ma-
ture.“ said Johnson.

"Rea especially did an excel-
lent job. For a freshman to even
qualif_v in the nationals is an

accomplishment. but to score.
it‘s an excellent job.“

Johnson preferred to talk of the
future rather than of the present.

“I think the track team has
‘grown up’. With Dorel Watley
returning, along with Dennis
Schatzman, Ted Bobby and the
other good prospects, comple-
mented by Dave Schurko, Rich
Jackson, and Dave Collins, three
fine recruits, the team will be a
good one again next year.”

Theofilos was selected to sev-

Hockey. and Phyllis Wojcie-
chowski for hockey. volleyball
and basketball.

Wojciechowski also received
the outstanding athlete of 1970-
71 award.

“Phyll is a three sport girl,”
explained swim coach Virginia
Grindle. “We all voted and talk-
ed about the decision. This
award won't be given every
year necessarily. This year we
felt however that Phyll deserv-
ed the recognition.”

Each coach presented her
team’s honors and Tennis coach
Dr. Goldie Edwards. the only
woman in Western Pennsylvan-
ia‘s Sports Hall of Fame. gave
the speech.

Her address centered around
the point that athletic interscho-
lastics is worth much more
than a letter and that not only
is it something to do not bene-
ficial to the participant in many
ways.

Bob Rosborough, represented
Myslinski and as Coach Grindle
put it “Added the final thrust to
the women's collegiate ban-
quet.”

The lack of adequate funds
delayed the planning of this
years banquet until late winter
term. However. funds will now
be allocated each year for its
continuance.

Grindle also mentioned that
the women athletes will have eq-
ual priviledges with the men
next year.
