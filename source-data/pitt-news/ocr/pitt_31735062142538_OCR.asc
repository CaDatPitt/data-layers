The Pitt News Reviews, lts News Ancl Finds That:
Students Gave Bloocl,Time, Money For

As usual, the Pitt News will be
different. And talk about the past,
instead of the future.

So get out the ﬁles and let’s see
what happened at the University of
Pittsburgh this semester. After .
careful reading we were able to
select the highlights for each week.

Week of Sept. 21—It was a
busy week for everyone. Fresh-
men scurried from meeting to
meeting to physical examination
and then to meeting again. Up-
perclassmen met and exchanged
vacation stories.‘ And everyone
registered. ~

Week of Sept. 28—That’s when
all the trouble started. We were

   

setting 9s.t;.o.f,

year followedrthe ﬁrst pep rally

of the year on Friday night. »
And we beat SMU.

Week of Oct. 5——Stude-nts
brushed up on their Russian,
Chinese, and Indian when ﬁve
war heroes payed us a visit. First
stamp drive forithe year was a
bigger success than either of the
two preceding opening drives.

Week of Oct. 12——Men’s fraterni-
ties started the mad rush. Men’s

Council sponsored a speed-limit
group. Women were busy too, with

Chief topic up before the next meeting of SFA is whether
the assembly should dissolve itself and in its place set up a
ﬁve-man, streamlined committee of four students and one fac-

I ~ ulty member to take over SFA’s functions for the duration.

And with reservations, we favor thedissolution amend-
ment, proposed by Al Mavrinac.

Here’s why we have our reservations. SFA is too politics-
ridden, too bogged down with self-advancing embryonic ward-
heelers to do any real good. Some of its members seem too
interested in political patronage for themselves, for their
fraternities, for their friends in IA, to accomplish any really

I signiﬁcant things.

And in saying this, we’re only echoing what members
of constitutional revisions committee (about half fraternity
men and half independents) admitted to us at their last
meeting.

The committee was unanimous in agreeing that SFA had
done nothing of lasting importance this year. One member
admitted playing the political patronage game, saying,
-“Sure I do. It’s’ the only way to get anywhere under the pres-
ent set-up.”

And one faculty member for whom we have a great
amount of respect told a board of students and faculty and

administration heads that he was amazed and disgusted to ‘

see “the extent to which petty campus politics has permeated
every phase of extra-curricular life.”

Now here’s our point. If small-time politics has weak-

ened SFA to the point where one of its own committees was

. unanimous in its own condemnation, and if SFA is to change
to a ﬁve-man committee, we think that_the same forces that
weakened SFA must be kept out of that ﬁve-man committee.
The first force that has to be guarded against is frater-
nity domination. For years back, prior to the “equal represen-
tation”. amendment of last year, SFA was little more than a
fraternity clearing house for patronage. And it was during
those years. that student interest in government was least,
and the vicious circle between lack of interest leading to fra-

I , ternity control leading to lack of interest, etc., was set up.

And another force to be watched before it gets control
of this ﬁve-man committee is an independent political clique
that is as totally unrepresentative of the student body as
were the fraternity bosses. ‘

For instance, an independent tapped to Druids on a po-
litical deal is thoroughly as reprehensible as dance chairman-

_.ships being doled out by houses—-the Phi Gams this month,

next month the Phi Eps; *

‘ And now SFA has the chance to do something to end this
destructive game that has been going on for years. By choos-

It A ing the right people for membership on this ﬁve-man com-

mittee, and by excluding from it all those who have risen to
their present status by the same political dealing that we’re
trying to keep from the new, ﬁve-man -committee, SFA can

 take a big ﬁrst step forward.

This means that the present independent and fraternity
junior party leaders, one quite as bad as the other, will have
to be counted out of the new committee. And the faculty
member ought to be one with the respect of most of us, and
one who sees clearly the danger that selﬁsh politics has
brought to student government at Pitt. . _ _ _

SFA knows its members. It knows who are its politicians,
‘and who are its men and women of merit. It is familiar with
its faculty representatives, and the fairness or partiality with
which they’ve voted.

Reservists Should Register

The Army and the Navy plans stated that enlisted reserv-
ists would not be called before the end of the current semester,"
which was deﬁnite enough in a negative sort of way.

» But the plans’ vagueness in saying when reservists would
be called has kept these students wondering if it would be
advisable to register for the coming semester. Is it much use,
they ask? ‘

The answer is yes.

There are three good reasons:

( 1) You can add credits toward your degree, since it is
possible that you’ll be able to ﬁnish the coming semester.

'(2) Your remaining in school is what the government
wishes. _

‘ (3) Your money would be refunded on a weekly basis,
that is, you would be charged one-sixteenth of the total tui-

H ~. ‘tion for each week in class..

Those are reasons enough to settle any reservist’s mind
that it is not only advisable but good sense to register for this
coming semester.

Near the end of the semester it
seems like all there are are engage-

case Helen Hayes has decided to
slow down and become attached
permanently to a VPI man.

things we never thought would
happen befell Tom Barr, esquire,
recently. He became engaged to
Sally Farrell, a last year’s Kap-

to becoming the oldest living un-
called reservist on the army air
corps list.

At last the truth comes out.
While he was in Chicago Don
Lingenfelter paid a lot of attention
to Viola Boydjieff’s sister, Vir-
ginia, and when Virginia came to
Pittsburgh for a three day vaca-
tion shortly before Christmas, Don
dated her up every night. But it
seems that Don really is carrying
a torch for Viola. And he was be-

’ ing nice to her sister so as to keep

it in the family. Now Viola doesn’t , 

know what to think.

Augie Travaioli is displaying ' 

his culinary art at the fraternity
houses lately. He ﬁxed up a spe-
cial spaghetti dinner for NoDK
Wednesday night. Incidentally,
he owes the Sigma Chis, if not
a spaghetti dinner, at least a lot
of thanks. They let him sleep at
the house Monday night after he
had spent a somewhat hectic eve-
ning, and Paul Schaughnecy had
to lead him home.

Sones Leads Discussion

For Tri-U Ass'n Sunday

A discussion of war problems
effecting the students will be led
by Dr. W. W. Sones, professor of

education and director of cirricul-
lum study, on Sunday, January 16,
at 4:30 o’clock when the Tri-Uni-
versity association meets in the
Bethesda Presbyterian Church
Paulson Avenue and Luna Street,
East End. Student comments and
reactions will be offered by Rich-
ard Dickinson, C43.

Dr. Sones, since coming to the
University more than twenty years
ago, has developed a great inter-
est in the study and investigation
of changes in the curriculum and
how they effect the. student in

peace and war times.

Changes that are taking place
and that will take place are deﬁ-
nitely important to the student,
and he should have an under-
standing comprehension of them,
states Dr. Sones.

After Dr. Sones addresses the it it

group,

Dickinson will direct the 

open forum that is to follow. Dick-

5_‘The war’s number one civilian

 military problem, the 'rubber
~ itshortage, is being attacked at the
«pi-{University of Pittsburgh.

Classes are being conducted for
women to learn the basic prob-
lems of plant operation as it
applies to the production of buta-
diene and styrene, the two chief
ingredients used in the manufac-
ture of synthetic rubber.

They are being trained for em-

four" rubber manufacturers will
develop a new synthetic.

Known on two sides of the At-
lantic is the man in charge, Dr.
James Coull, professor and head
of the department of chemical en-
gineering. Dr. Coull summarized
the need for the class in an ad-
dress to the women students.

“You are a necessary factor in
war production. The number of
troops we are able to maintain de-
pends on how much you and other
war workers can produce. But
you are of particular importance
because you will be operating a
plant essential to our ﬁghting
forces."

Sixty young women are taking
the course. They were carefully
selected, Dr. Coull explained.
“They are high school graduates,
some well equipped with mathe-
matics and even physics and

 

chemistry.”
“The course is one of doing,” ac-

cording to Dr. Coull. “Moreover,

he warned, “it is to be thorough.”
The girls are being instructed in
how to operate a plant, using the
most efficient modern methods.
They are taught care of valuable
machinery, and to spot and cor-
rect anything wrong. At the end
of the term they will be semi-
skilled technicians ready to turn
out ingredients for making rubber.

The class is of importance to
the government. Tuition is paid
under a grant from the United
States Oﬁice of Education.

“Most of the workers live in the
Beaver Valley. They are trans-
ported to the University in busses
and in this we have had the full-
est cooperation from Washington.”
Dr. Coull said.

AlbertMavrinac’s sweeping proposal for the complete

'i’Ete0rganization of Student-Faculty association Was unani-

mously endorsed by the constitutional revisions committee

is Tuesday, and with slight modiﬁcation, the plan will be re-
ferred back to the assembly for ﬁnal acceptance at what may
be the assembly’s last. meeting Wednesday.

,. The proposed plan would replace SFA by a committee
composed of four students and three faculty members, two of
-the three faculty members being the dean of men and the dean

. of -women.

However, the deans do not vote. Their position on the

committee is advisory, voting

the students and the faculty

member (to be picked by the
student members). ,_

is ,UneXpected ﬁreworks broke
out at the meeting when com-

.. mittee chairman ' Abe Blue-

stone asked former Pitt News edi-
tor Irwin Rosen if hehad anything

« to say about the formation of the
i new government.

Rosen, having
stepped down from activity in cam-

glpus affairs. attended the meeting at

the invitation of several committee

ffmembers who had heard his views ,
on student government.

Rosen charged that it was a

 selﬁsh, small-time, political patron-
_ page systemithat had wrecked SFA
‘just as much as had the war.

And the committee was unanim-

 ous in its agreement with him. Al

,‘ sible for _a student tohreceive recog-

,,”nition under the present set-up,
- without playing party .politics..’’

“It-must be the job of you mem-

 bers of SFA.” Rosen charged “to
see that this new committee is kept

free of the old guard fraternity_
and independent politicians, who

-if have, withtheir undemocratic and

selﬁsh“ political bickering, ..just
aboutywrecked student interest in
SFA.’_’ , ,

“It would be a ﬁne gesture,”

_ Rosen continued, “for Lee McFad-
*den and Abe

represent and personify the present

den can make a far more lasting
contribution to student government
than they can by continuing the
old “spoils system” in the new
committee.

“And if these men fail to make
this gesture, then it becomes nec-
essary for those interested in the
future of student government to
oppose their election with every
bit of power they have,” Rosen con-
cluded.

RHODA MAE LANDAY

By ALEX ZELENSKI ~
Drayma Editor" -

Had Harriet Beecher Stowe been
among the‘ 600 faculty people last
Wednesday evening that crowded
the Foster Memorial -to see the
Pitt Players production” of -her
famous novel, “Uncle Tom’s Cab-
in,” sheﬁwould have been quite
proud.

Miss Stowe fashioned a priceless
American folk piece, and Buell
Whitehill, Jr., continued to treat
it with all the devotion and respect
reserved in the Theatre for a
classic.

There have been some splendid
performances given by the Pitt
Thespians this year “Abe Lincoln
In Illinois,” “Till The Day I Die,”
to mention only a few, but their
opening night show, undoubtedly,
takes down top honors-.

‘ Excellent casting ‘o'f“the "amateur
University students. had much to
do with the _resu1=t,. Paul Schau-
gency’s portrayal of kindly, old
Uncle""I‘om, with an exception in
the Third Act when he is called
upon to sing two hymns that were
obviously keyed too-high for him,
was excellent. .

By the middle of‘ the ﬁrst act,_j
Rhoda Mae Landay’-is‘ nervousness
completely disappeared, her voice
came down, her lines rolled more
easily, she was Topsey to the life.
Miss Landay appeared in only the
ﬁrst two acts which was quite a
disappointment" to the audience

who kept expecting her to'reap-..

pear. The part of Topseyis always
deﬁnitely a scene-stealer with her
“I’se so wicked” and darky dance
steps, and with Miss Landay play-
ing the part, it was so again last

Shockley Predicts Non-Effect orwar   
On Afternoon, Evening Registration

By PAULPFISCI-[NER

Despite the uncertainty of Ameri-
can college life in war-time, Dr.
Frank W. Shockley, director of ex-
tension division, of the summer ses-
sions, and of the late afternoon,
evening, and Saturday classes, said
that he expects evening and exten-
sion class registration to remain
practically the same as it was dur-
ing the past semester.

To partially meet some of the
war-time demands of business
and industry, the University’s
evening school has, since the out-
break of the world crisis, altered
its courses to include subjects
that contributed as much. as pos-
sible toward the solution, of, the
problems facing our country.

Special c o u r s e s in war-time

chemistry,
meteorology, radio code and com-.
munications, engineering,.and other
technical subjects were added to the
curricula. .  ._ P

The evening school department of
nursing added several courses
which .,helped to provide student
and graduate nurses that are so

‘urgently needed today. _ _

Courses in history and political

science, were designed to acquaint’

students with the histories and in-
ternational policies of our allies and
of our enemies.

Subjects dealing with account-
ing, b u s i n e s s administration,
business law, commercial educa-
tion, industrial planning, and in
commercial subjects were added
to a ‘schedule that was already,
well ﬁlledwith studies of busi-
ness administration subjects.

To add even more to its program
for dealing with war—time educa-
tional problems, the evening divi-
sion of the University has added a
special schedule of ten weeks
courses in business administration,
which are particularly contributory

to the war ‘effort. These courses in-

clude: cost accounting, standard
production costs, office manage-
ment,, personnel management,
labor relations, elementary business
statistics, and industrial manage-
ment.

Registration for these courses,
as well as for all other evening
school studies will be from 6:30
to 9 o’clock on February 4 and 5,
and on Saturday, February 6
from 9 to 12 o’clock and from 1 to
3 o’clock.

Bv Elaine Kalm SPORTS EDITOR

We always promised ourself that if we ever had a column
to write, the first one was going to be about Pitt’s own Doctor
Carlson. This was a promise born not entirely of sentiment,
our initial assignment being an interview with the Doctor. It
was rather a desire to do something about the peculiar debt
owed by the Pitt News to Dr. Carlson who has always con-
stituted a kind of one—man Valhalla for News sports writers.

While other coaches might demur in the .

way of making statements for public con-
sumption or merely concern themselves

, with the prosaic facts at hand, the Doctor
always managed to produce a fresh version
of the fatigue curve, the possibility of an
afternoon game, or a new diet for his‘bas-
"ketballer players‘ for harrassed writers
haunted by the thought of columns ﬁlled

with beautiful white space.

" In fact, the Doctor is still the only person

‘we know who not only supplies the writer
with the information for the story at hand,
but material for two other features, a  -
monkey, and an autographed copy of his DR, cAm_soN
book as well.

Not- that the'Doctor in any way discriminates against
the other sections of the News. Last year, in the ﬂush days
when the News went eight pages thrice weekly, the Doctor
was featured so often that for a time the News began to
look like.the Carlson family scrapbook. On pages one, two,
and three he. would be telling about the blood bank, or tuber-
culosis tests, or hospitalization. On pages six and seven he
would be telling about basketball and the fatigue curve. On
one occasion, after the Doctor’s'picture had run in three con-
secutive issues, an ominous threat was received from one
member of the faculty. “Believe me,”. he pleaded, “I like Dr.
Carlson, but if I see his picture just once more this week I’m
going to scream.”

Anyway, we had carefully saved certain phases of Carl-
sonana for this column. Like the story of the Doctor’s book,
YOU AND BASKETBALL and how it came to be written.
That was when the Doctor was attending one of the basketball
conferences. It was pretty hot and in the middle of his lecture
the Doctor stopped to mention this fact in appropriate lan-
guage, concluding by saying “What’s the use of going on. You
can read about it in my book.” He was somewhat surprised

' when Clair Bee, the Coach of Long Island U, asked the price
of the book. He thought for a minute, decided that $3.75
sounded like a pretty good price for a book and so informed
Mr. Bee. The price did not, as the.Doctor hoped, deter Mr. Bee
who proceeded to write out a check. Before the Doctor left he
had somehow collected ten checks for his book. The only trou-
ble was that he didn’t have a book. However, before he had to
worry too much about being arrested for collecting money

under false pretenses, a publisher arrived on the scene and
._YOU AND BASKETBALL resulted. .

This by no means ﬁnished the Doctor’s literary career.
“He also is responsible for BASKETBALL, THE AMERICAN
GAME, and many articles. We are rather fond of one he
currently has up in his office titled Dribble Drivel. The fact
that it is yet unsold is, we believe, not solmuch a_reﬂection on
the article itself as on the fact that probably no editor could
ever quite get the title out of his mouth without strangling.
We also preserved all the Doctor’s varied escapades on
the basketball courts, he being a kind of combination P. T.
Barnum, Leo Durocher, and Frankie Frisch, greatly delight-
ing in baiting the oflicials. Only recently he authored the state-
ment that he felt sure the officials would make excellent com-
mando’s because if they could get into a game without pay-
ing, getting into the enemy country would be an extremely
minor feat indeed.

He registers his disapprovalin unique but effective ways.
.Thus,»in one game when the clock was not stopped ‘as the

...xu...

. Doctor thought it should be, he calmly grabbed the timer’s

gun and shot at it. This stopped the clock and the officials
stopped Carlson. v ‘

At the West Virginia game last year he made a subtle
but pointed attack on what he thought of the justice dispensed
by the oﬂicials when he picked up all his player’s jackets, and
the water buckets and presented them to the officials. “You’ve
taken everything else,” he told them. “You might as Well

‘have these, too.” For this little episode the Doctor was ban-
ished from the game, whereupon he took a seat in the stands,
draped a babushka about his head and proceeded to hurl abuse
at the officials.

Anyway, and as we said before, all these stories we care-
fully hoarded. We polished them over in our mind, all in prep-
aration for the some-day column. It therefore pained us not
a little when a downtown sports writer had the same idea, not
to mention the same stories, plus the advantage of an earlier
publication date. It wouldn’t do any good to tell people that
it was our idea in the ﬁrst place and that we intended to do
it all the time. -

No one would ever believe us.

Johnny Lawther’s high scoring,
championship - minded Nitt any
Lions came to Pittsburgh last
night to take on the two Oakland
schools in a few sociable games of
basketball.

They started their Pittsburgh
stand last night against the Tar-
tans of Carnegie, and tomorrow
night they move to the Stadium to
take on the giant-killersof Pitt.

The Lions bring a highly

touted team here-—-one which,
despite its loss to New York Uni-
versity, is held to be one of the
best in the East. Last year they
climaxed their regular season by in
beating Illinois, Big Ten Champs, a
41-34, in the NCAA Invitation
tourney before losing to Dart-i
mouth, 41-34.

From that outﬁt, which won 18
out of 21 contests, Coach Lawther
lost three important players-—
Elmer Gross, the team's steadiest
and best all-around competitor,
Dick Grimes, a rugged and proﬁ-
cient defensive player,rand Bob Ra-
min, the squad?s best long shot
artist. C

Returning are four lettermen:
Co-Captain Herk Baltimore, all-
State center last winter, who tied
with Gross at 181 points for the
season’s high scorer; Johnny Egli,
who at 5-11 is the shortest start-
er, and is the other co-captain;
-Larry Gent, who scored 21 points
against Illinois in the post-sea-
son tourney; and Dave Horn-
stein, 6 feet, 5-inch junior who
takes over the center post vacat-
ed by Baltimore.

Fifth potential starter is Sopho-
more Whitey Von Neida, who has
already proved his worth by leading
his mates in their recent win over
Temple.

Also sure to play is freshman
Jack Biery, who recently set a Penn

State scoring record. His 22 points ,

against Susquehanna represented
the largest number ever made on
the State home court.

Coach Lawther was one of the
first coaches to use the “sliding
zone” defense which interested New
York basketball experts when the
Penn State mentor brought a ﬁne
Westminster team to play in Madi-
son Square Garden. The sliding
zone is one in which the defensive
men play areas of the court where
there is an offensive threat, these
areas changing each time the
offensive threat changes.

Lawther’s zone came in handy
at Penn State where he found it
necessary to develop green play-
ers who, -for the most part, had
not been high school stars and
who did not possess the natural
ability necessary for the man-for-
man defense. With this type of
player Lawther also considered it
advisable to teach a rather slow-
moving deliberate olfense. In
other words he has had consider-
able success in _developing a sys-
tem most adaptable to the type
of players available at Penn
State.

He sums up his reasons for using
the less-spectacular deliberate of-

ense by saying: “When we are
playing against a faster team using
a. fast break, we have found that
by slowing down our offense it in-
variably causes the opposition to
slow down their oﬁense. As a rule,
our opponents are not as used to
these methods as we are. ‘I am sure
that the deliberate offense is better
for a bigger team, almost sure to
be outplayed by smaller players if

Uncle Sam Exercises Priority On One
More Sports W/riter--it-Herman Says G'by

By MIKE HERMAN

This is our last column for the
News. This is the last time we’ll
sit at- a typewriter in the oﬂice
telling how the PiKA’s walked off
with the football championship, or
about Phi Gam superiority when
Frank Carver totaled the points in
the intramural race, or, more re-
cently, about colorful Doc Carlson
and his boys.

We’ve sat here for an hour, try-
ing to think of some Way to say
what we want to say. We could say
that it’s been fun, or that it’s been
swell, but somehow those words
don’t tell what we feel It has been
fun, and it has been swell, and
working on the News has given us
more satisfaction than anything
else we ever did, but there’s more
to it than that.

Maybe its sitting here watching
freshman Joe Tolochko struggling
with his ﬁrst story, and knowing
that he’s going to get the same
kick out of working for the News
that we did.

Or it might be playing chess
With Bill Pankuch, and listening to
his colorful swearing as the other
News loafers heckled us.

Or maybe it’s just knowing fel-
lows like Al Zelenski and Sheme

,Bazell, two of the most likeable
people We’ve ever met We’ve en-
joyed working with them and being

with them, and we know we’ll miss
them when they're gone. We want
to wish these two the best of luck
in the new chapter each is about to
enter, for both have certainly made
this life a brighter one.

And to Jerry Ripp, who didn’t
get what he wanted, and perhaps
is a better man for it, we tip our
hat.

Maybe it is the fact that we’ve
got to go and won’t be seeing Zee
and Sheme and Jerry and the rest
of the fellows that we’re so sorry
to say goodbye.

It’s probably all those things,
and more. We know that we’ve met
some of the grandest people just
by being a Pitt News reporter.
People We’ve liked immensely, and
ones we’ll never forget.

Men like George Chirigos and Al
Mavrinac and Panchuk and Paul
Pﬁschner. And Len Bortz and Ar-
nie Bree and Bill Ollis. To these
we say goodbye and thanks, for it
was fellows like these that made
our ﬁve semesters at Pitt so enjoy-
able and so satisfying.

To Frank Carver, another vote
of thanks, for it was his helpful-
ness that made what might have
been a dull job bright and enjoy-
able.
