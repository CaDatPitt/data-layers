Chest Drive
Asks For $2

Today is C-Day-—Pitt Chest
Day.
This is the day the student

speakers will appear in classrooms
'asking for pledges for the Pitt
. Chest.
Chest oﬁicials estimate that a $2
contribution from each student
‘will put the Chest over the top
, in its goal of $9000 for the 1950-
1951 school year.

By contributing $2 to’ the Pitt
Chest, students free themselves
from individual campaigns by each
charity. ’

One contribution takes care of
the Community Fund, the Red

_ Cross, the March of Dimes, CARE,

World Student Service Fund,
United Negro College Fund, Pitt

\ Men and Women’s Loan Fund, and
the United Negro Scholarship
Fund.

More than 50 students have

' ‘signed up to solicit funds in class-

 

rooms. Each student is asked by
Chest oﬂicials to be in his class
third and sixth hours today and
give full cooperation to the speak-
ers.

Since last fall’s drive fell $5200
short of the quota, the Pitt Chest
is trying once more to raise enough
to meet its goal.

Student chairman, Jim Hoobler,
says that the committee and its
speakers have been briefed for
the drive and will give all their
time and energy today to swing
it..All they need is cooperation,
Hoobler says. _,

Students who do not have their
contributions with them in class
today may pay pledges at the Stu-

 dent Desk,

Wins Top Award
Among Bi -

Weeklies

The Pitt News this week reaffirmed its position as ‘One

of America’s great student newspapers’ by winning the As-
sociated Collegiate Press ‘All-American’ rating for the third

successive year.

In announcing the receipt of the top honor rating, Publi-

cations Director George Hackenberg stated, “Winning the

All-American Rating from the ACP is a real feather in the

cap of the Pitt News and theO

whole University.

‘Vigorous Service’ Policy

“The News won its top rating in
competition with many college pa-
pers having paid staffs, wider
services, and many of the other
aspects of professional journalism.
I think the award can be credited
to a sincere News policy of vigor-
ous service to the University and
its students and to near-profes-
sional work by editors and staff
members.”

Editorial Treatment Praised

The rating, highest given by the
ACP’s critical service, was for the
ﬁrst semester of the 1950-51 year,
and was based on such aspects of
newspaper production as news
values, sources, writing, and edit-
ing; headlines, typography, and
makeup; editorial and sports
pages; coverage and treatment of
news and features.

The News rated particularly

Handlin

Of Ballots Charged
By Doloris Schauh

THOMAS

News Editor —

Persistent rumors of lost ballots, fraud, and mishandling

in the recent all-student elections erupted into the open in
Monday’s Student Congress meeting.

. At that time President Howard Greenberger’s commit-

tee report on the election was, in effect, not accepted by the

Instead, after an hour and 25 minutes of sometimes bit-
ter debate, the legislators passed?

Andy Schurman’s motion that
Congress should resolve itself into
a ‘committee of the whole’ and
further investigate and recount
the election returns.
Results Changed

Most of the controversy centered
around -a disputed women’s sen-
ior Congress seat. Returns re-
leased after the elections showed
that Marion Post (954) and D010-
res Shaub (932) had been elected
with Ann Curran (928) losing by
only four votes.

After a recount Friday, two days
later, however, the election com-
mittee reversed its decision and
declared that Miss Curran with
924 votes had displaced , Miss
Shaub who ended up after four
recountings with 923.

It is not known who called for
the recount.

The ruckus in Congress was
intensiﬁed when Greenberger
read during his report a. letter
from the deposed candidate,
Miss Shaub, in which she
charged she had been “treated
unfa,irly.”

She wrote that “fourteen bal-
lots were ‘lost’,” and that “from
all appearances the entire (elec-
tion) procedure was handled in a
slipshod manner.”

Greenberger denied both these
charges and said the discrepancy
between the ﬁrst and last results
could be attributed to “simple
miscounting” the ﬁrst time.

“Pretty Disgusted”

At one point in the debate,
Grace Salzman told Congress that
“A lot of rotten things have hap-
pened in the last few weeks. I’m
pretty disgusted myself!” She did
not amplify on a third statement
that “People should not go around
holding grudges.”

Don Ewart brought up the point
that since the ﬁnal women’s re-
sults had been changer, a recount-
ing might bring out a discrepancy
in the men’s results also. In the
men’s senior balloting, incumbent
Gene Cowie lost by only 11 votes
while Bill Sullivan trailed Cowie
by one.

The committee of the whole will
meet Friday‘ at 1:30 p. m. in the
dean of men’s ofﬁce to re-examine
the ballots. ._

It will hand down its decision

on Monday.

Fitzgerald
To Attend
Oath Talks

Chancellor Rufus Fitzgerald
will appear before state legis-
lators considering the Senate’s
‘loyalty oath bill’ next Mon-
day at the invitation of the
bill’s sponsor, Sen. Albert
Pechan, and the head of the
House Legislative Committee,
Ivan Watkins.

Meanwhile, the faculty of The
College here, the largest school of
the University, drafted a state-
ment representing its stand on the
oath question, and has submitted
it to the faculties of other Univer-
sity schools. The statement reads:

“The faculties of the University
of Pittsburgh would welcome an
opportunity to demonstrate their
loyalty to the Nation and the
[Commonwealth through subscrib-
ing to the oath which Article 7,
Section 1 of the Constitution of
Pennsylvania requires of all sen-
ators and representatives and all
judicial, state and county officers.

“The faculties believe, however,
that Senate Bill 27, considered as
a whole goes far beyond a loyalty
oath and has a dangerous tendency
to give to an administrative offi-
cial power of deﬁnition amounting
to thought control. Individual At
torneys-General might thus have
the power to destroy the basic
freedoms which all Americans
prize.

“Accordingly, while affirming
their vital interest in preventing
the spread of Communism in and
out of places of education and
public employment, the faculties
respectfully urge the disapproval
of Senate Bill 27. They also urge
that no bill of this character
should be passed without public
hearings at which representatives
of educational groups may ap-
pear.”

Ratiﬁcation of this statement
was pending in other schools of

the University early Tuesday.

Draft Test

  Ignored

By Students

College students seem to
have stopped worrying about
being drafted at the end of
the semester.

According to Brigadier Gen-
eral Louis H. Renfrow, deputy
director of Selective Service,
students are not applying fast
enough for applications for
the . nation-wide deferment
qualiﬁcation test. A

In a recent radio broadcast, 1

Gen. Renfrow stated that it
is “vitally important for every-
one eligible for the test to take
it.”

Selective Service administrators
are worried that too few students
will take the test scheduled for

‘May 26, June 16, and June 30,

1951. They may order draft boards
to induct students who have not
taken the test.

A fourth day, Thursday,
July 12, on which students
may take the College Quali-
ﬁcation Test, has been added,
according to the Pittsburgh
office of the Pennsylvania Se-
lective Service System. I

This date has been arrang-
ed only for those registrants
whose religious convictions
would prevent their taking it
on May 26, June 16, or June
30, all of which are Saturdays.

Dents, Phi Gams Set Early Pace

The Dental Seniors and Phié

Gams are setting the early pace in
IM softbal1—both teams copping
their second victories Monday aft-
ernoon.

The Dents outslugged the Med
Sophomores, 10-5, while the Phi
Gams won from Alpha Phi Delta
by forfeit, 9-0.

Other teams with two victories
are the PiKA’s and Chem Engi-
neers.

Dents on Rampage

Sparked by Tom Eilderton’s
masterful two-hit pitching and
Tom Cressley’s booming bat, the

' Dental Seniors trounced Alpha

Kappa Psi by _a 14-0 score in~last
Friday’s IM action. at Schenley
Oval.

The Dental Seniors jumped on
A-K-Psi’s starting hurler, Andy
Duli, for two runs at the outset,
and then proceeded -to hammer
him for seven more counters be-
fore he was relieved by Ollie
Slinker in the ﬁfth inning.

Leading the Dent’s twelve-hit
barrage was Cressley, who collect-
ed two singles and a triple in ﬁve
trips. The Dents were helped con-
siderably by A-K-Psi’s shoddy

ﬁelding which resulted
errors.

Highlighting last Thursday’s IM
games was the traditionally rug-
ged Phi Ep-P‘ Lam tilt. The Eps
copped this one, 6-4, at Schenley
Oval.

The second inning was the big
one for the victors, as they cash-

in nine

~ ed in on Pi Lam miscues and two

walks to score ﬁve runs.

The Lams countered with a
home run by Ed Stone in the third,
but the Eps once again reaped the
proﬁts of an error to run their
total to six—all unearned runs.

.$/.F.1i- Means Fine lﬁbacco

LUCKIES TASTE- BETTER
THAN ANY OTHER CIGARETTE 1

Fine tobacco——and only ﬁne tobacco—can give you the
perfect mildness and rich taste that make a cigarette com-
pletely enjoyable. And Lucky Strike means ﬁne tobacco.
So if you’re not happy with your present brand (and a
38-city survey shows that millions are not), switch to
Luckies. You'll find that Luckies taste better than any
other cigarette. Be Happy—Go Lucky today!

A veteran who began his
course before the cut-off date and
has continued in it until the end of
the Spring Semester, 1951, will be
considered to be in training even
though he temporarily interrupts
the courses for summer vacation
or for other reasons.

A vet continuing G.I. Bill
courses after the cut-oft" date
must pursue his studies continu-
ously until completion unless in-
terrupted by conditions beyond
his control.

Veterans who have been re-
called to active duty may on com-
pletion of military duty resume
their training under the G.I. Bill
if their conduct and progress had
been satisfactory, and if training
was begun before the call.
