Crime alert issued by Piﬁ public safety

By John B. Moore
Asst. News Editor

A Crime Alert warning students to pay
attention and not walk alone has been issued
following an early morning on-carnpus rob-
bery Friday.

On Sept. 9, at 12:21 a.m., a female walk-
ing alone at the 100 block of South
Belleﬁeld Avenue was pushed to the ground
on the lawn area of the Cathedral of
Learning by a male.

“The victim was walking back from
Craig Street, and while on the [Cathedral of
Learning] lawn area, the actor came up and

pushed her onto the ground,” according to
Gary Moses, the assistant director of Public
Safety.

The suspect then pulled out what appeared
to be a gun and demanded her purse, which
she turned over, according to the Crime
Alert.

According to Moses, the actor took the
purse, assaulted the victim then ﬂed on foot.

The victim then went to Forbes Avenue
and Bouquet Street, where she was able to
contact campus police.

“Several people were stopped [that
night],” said Moses. “She could not identify
them.”

In the purse was a MAC card, a driver’s
license, an I.Q. telephone card. a check and
savings book and cash, all contents totaled
around $100.

Campus police are stressing the impor-
tance of students being alert and aware of
their surroundings. They should also not
walk alone late at night, and they should
Contact campus police if they see someone
acting in a suspicious manner, according to
the Crime Alert.

The police are still looking for the suspect.
The description is a black male, 5—feet—7—
inches and 130 pounds. At the time of the

Pitt SEAC tofocus on newforestproject

By Chris Lombardo
For The Pitt News

A forest is being destroyed,
but it’s not in the Pacific
Northwest, it is. in Northcentral

. Pennsylvania.

The Allegheny National

Forest has been losing its tree‘

population since after World
War II, and the U.S. government
is to blame, according to Student
Enviromnental Action Coalition
member Matt Peters.

The Allegheny Defense
Project is the project SEAC will
focus on this upcoming year.
The project aims to halt the
rapid deforestation of the ANF
and expose the illegal logging
habits of the U.S. Forest Service.

“The U.S. Forest Service has
opened almost 95 percent of the
ANF to logging. That leaves
only 5 percent for conservation.
They’re going against their own
laws by doing this,” said Peters.
The irony of this situation lies in
the fact that the ANF is public
land, and public timber is being
sold to private industry there,
according to Peters.

Although the Forest Service
replants many of the acres they
destroy, they are replanting with
trees that don't essentially
belong in the ANF in large
quantities, and these trees have
disturbed the ecological balance
of the forest.

ANF was basically ﬁlled with
different species of evergreen

trees. The number of evergreens
has rapidly decreased while a
population of replanted black
cherry trees, which are popular-
for making furniture, replaces
them, according to SEAC.

Economically, according to
Peters, the trees are sold to over-
seas markets, mainly Japan, and
used for furniture. That fumi-
ture, in turn, is sold back on the
U.S. market. Aside from the jobs
the woodcutting provides, there
are no other beneﬁts to logging
in the ANF.

Pitt’s SEAC is planning a
trip to the Allegheny National
Forest this weekend in con-
junction with other SEAC chap-
ters from around region 13,‘

Piﬂ in
jeopardy
of losing
NSABP  

By John B. Moore
Asst. News Editor

After nearly 30 years of hous-
ing a $1,000,000-plus breast
cancer study project, the
University of Pittsburgh is in
jeopardy of losing it because
Pitt officials have failed to find
a candidate to head the project.

According to the Sept. 9
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, more

than six people outside Pitt _

have shown interest in heading
the National Surgical Adjuvant
Breast and Bowel Project
(NSABP), an independent
organization which has been
missing a chair for the past five
months, when Dr. Bernard
Fisher was fired.

The Sept. 9 article mentions
three possible nominees, Dr.
Norman Wolmark — of
Allegheny General Hospital,
Dr. Janet Osuch of Michigan
State University and Dr.
Rodney Foster of Emory
University.

Since the NSABP is an inde-
pendent organization, the new
chair must be approved by the
group’s executive committee

and the National Cancer

Institute.

Although Pitt
acknowledged the NSABP
headquarters will move to
wherever the new chair is, the
university did not have a state-
ment as of Friday.

At the June 15 U.S. House of
Representatives Subcommittee
on Oversight and Investigation
hearings, representatives from
Pitt expressed interest in com-
peting for the management of
the NSABP.

Chancellor J. Dennis
O’Connor replied, “We certain-
ly do intend to compete,” when
asked by a Congressional rep-

BELFAST —- Northern Irish
Protestant extremists carried
their violent campaign against
a united Ireland south to
Dublin on Monday, setting off
a small bomb on a passenger
train and injuring two people.

British and Irish officials
denounced the attack but were
confident it would not derail a
l2-day-old Irish Republican
Army cease—fire and peace
efforts surrounding it.

The outlawed Ulster
Volunteer Force said it placed
the bomb on the train, as well
as six others around Dublin.
But police, who said only the
detonator of the train bomb
exploded, found no other
bombs.

The group said in a state-
ment the explosion was a
warning to the Irish govern-
ment that “Northern Ireland is
still British and will not be
coerced, forced or persuaded
into a united Ireland.” -—

CAIRO, Egypt — After nine
days of emotional debate on
the rights and wrongs of abor-
tion, sex and family life, a
United Nations conference set
goals Tuesday for slowing the
world population growth over
the next 20 years.

 

If the non-binding program
succeeds, the United Nations
said, world population, now
5.67 billion, will remain below
7.5 billion in the year 2015. If
it fails, the world could have
up to 7.92 billion people in
2015, and 12.5 billion in 2050.

More than 150 delegations
to the U.N. International
Conference of Population and
Development adopted the final
declaration. —— Reuters

WASHINGTON —— President
Clinton signed a $30.billion
crime bill aimed at making
America’s streets safer and
giving members of Congress
some grist for the fall re-elec-
tion campaigns.

The bill pays for the hiring
of 100,000 more police, more
prisons and crime prevention
programs. It also bans 19 types
of assault weapons. —— Reuters

WASHINGTON ~— The air-
craft carrier America sailed for
Haiti Tuesday afternoon from
Norfolk, Va., and the carrier
Eisenhower is scheduled
Wednesday for departure,
defense officials said. U.S.
troops and helicopters are on
board to take part in any inva-
sion of Haiti.

The America is believed to
be carrying elite U.S. special

forces troops that would take
part in any initial thrust into
Port-au-Prince. The
Eisenhower is loaded with
attack and transport heli-
copters as well as army troops.

The United States already
has at least 15 warships in the
Caribbean, and the Clinton
administration has repeatedly
warned Haiti’s military leaders
an invasion is approaching
unless they step aside for the
return of deposed President
Jean—Bertrand Aristide. ——

Right-sizing. Just—in-time
hiring. Multi-sourcing. If
you’re not sure what these
terms mean, now’s a good
time to start learning. The
job market is changing, and
your ideas on how to find
work have to change along
with it. Whether you’re a
soon-to-graduate senior, or a
first-year student, an under-
standing of today’s hiring
process is
essential for
your future.

Let’s start
with “right-
s i z i n g . ”
Basically,
this is just a
fancy word ,
for eliminating of corporate
staff positions, or not ﬁlling
positions when they become
vacant. The reason for this is
simple. Competition in both
the domestic and global mar-
kets have forced companies
to trim costs, and personnel

  

is a company’s biggest V

expense. Many large compa-
nies are still going through
this process. This means that
you’ll probably not see a lot
of hiring activity in many of

The
Placement
Center

these companies in the fore-
seeable future. It also means
that you’ll have to find other
avenues of employment. The
trick is in ﬁnding altemative
job sources. ,

A good place to start loo —
ing is small- to medium-
sized companies.
Traditionally, the driving
force behind the creation of
new jobs in the United States
and their
importance
to new col-
lege grads
as potential
employers,
h a s
' increased
significant-
ly over the past few years
with the hiring decline
among the Fortune 500
companies. But unlike large
corporations, smaller firms
can’t project their manpower
needs much beyond a few
months. They usually hire
people on an as—needed
basis, with very quick tum-
around times. This process is
described as “just—in-time
hiring.”

lt’s also important to know
that small companies are looking
for speciﬁc types (or proﬁles) of
candidates —— self-starters with a
lot of versatility, initiative and
team-building skills. Academic
majors and grade point average

employers. You need to present
yourself as a three-dimensional

In the June 22 issue of The

._ Chair Dr. Ronald Herberman

said he believes Pitt is now
“uniquely suited to be able to
stabilize the [NSABP] and to
keep its important programs on
track” with all of the current
corrective procedures.

The search for the new
NSABP chair at Pitt was headed
by O’Connor and five other
people.

Even if Pitt does lose the
NSABP, it still can serve as a
major contributor to the project
by competing to keep the biosta—
tistical center.

The center is responsible for
collecting and analyzing data
from the more than 500 medical
centers participating in the
breast and bowel cancer studies.
If the center stays at Pitt, the
university will be able to keep a
portion of the NSABP’s federal
grant, an estimated $6 million to
$8 million a year.

The NSABP is composed of

Opinions

No vote on Haiti

On Thursday, Sept. 1,-The Pitt News called for President
Clinton to invade Haiti as soon as possible. This has not yet
happened, but many believe an invasion to be pending.
However, another controversy has arisen over the issue of
invading Haiti — whether or not the president can order an
invasion without congressional approval.

The New York Times reported there has been a growing call to
put the issue to a vote. On Sunday, Clinton’s aides responded,
stating that the president does not need the approval of
Congress. And yesterday The New York Times itself entered the
fray with its head editorial proclaiming: “Congress must vote
on Haiti.”

The Times and those calling for a congressional vote argue
that an invasion without prior congressional approval would
“short-circuit the United States Constitution.” They claim that
congressional deliberation is practical, desirable and that plenty
of time exists for it.

They also believe the conditions warranting an American
invasion "must include broad public support and congressional
agreement and that the War Powers Resolution requires the
president to acquire congressional approval.

Examining these views one by one shows their fallacious-
ness. First off, “congressional deliberation” is hardly what we
would call practical or desirable. Congress is split by factional-
ism and partisan politics. As for plenty of time, what has
Congress been doing all these months? It has hardly shown an
ability to make quick decisions. The people of Haiti have suf-
fered enough without being forced to deal with the sloth of
Congress as we Americans must. ‘

Also, to require broad public support and congressional
agreement for an invasion to be ordered would set a dangerous
precedent. History has shown the fickleness of both Congress
and the populace. I

How many people would have been in favor of the invasion
of Grenada if asked beforehand? Yet after the “boys are put in
the field,” public support comes pouring in.

Finally, the War Powers Resolution hardly requires the presi-

dent to get congrespsionalsapproval. It was made law in 1973 to I

prevent another long drawn-out conﬂict like Vietnam.

It calls for consultation of Congress prior to action, if possi-
ble, and gives Congr,,e}sfs,,;the power to recall troops 60-90 days
after_ their placement into hostile territory. However, the War
Powers Resolution saysnothing about requiring a congression-
al vote. O p 9

Ultimately, the last thing this country needs is to create
another level of bureaucracy by letting Congress vote on the
implementation of troops (to say nothing of telling the enemy
that we are coming ahead of time).

We need a strong president who can make tough decisions
rather. than rely on the fickleness of the American people. That
means we have to live with idiots like Reagan, but that is better
than the idiots in Congress. ‘ '

Open season on diversity l994

iversity season ‘94 has
gotten off to a roaring
start. Once again,

debate in the pages of The Pitt
News and maybe even on cam-
pus will rage back and forth as
to whether Pitt is diverse
enough or just a hotbed of

Eurocentric repression.
The University has even been

charged with living in the 18005.
(Really, I’d prefer the ﬁrst half of
this century, I’m partial to such
things as indoor plumbing.) Yet,
these lukewarm attempts at

diversity show just how back-

wards this university can be.
What Pitt needs todo is get

caught up in the wave of ‘60s

nosta1g_ia.which has taken this

country by storm. Woodstock .

was revisited, and now such joys
as segregated housing are also
making a comeback. Now, no
one is suggesting a return to
ghettoes and the riots of ‘67, but
rather, just a reconsideration of
the diversity programs which
have been torn down through
reforms since the early ‘60s.

Pitt ought to examine the pro-
grams of universities which have
made true progress towards
diversity. Schools such as Duke,
Cornell, and A Wesleyan
University have all introduced
wonderful‘ programs to allow
students to get in touch with
their heritage. They can finally
escape this artificial republic
which is the United States and
return to their true roots.

These schools have developed
special housing for various
groups which make up their stu-
dent populations. Or, if special
“program houses” weren’t avail-
able, they have uni-racial frater-
nities as an auxiliary. Duke
decided last year to move a black
fraternity from one part of the
campus to another in order to
diversify its campus. That is one
of the advantages of these racial-
ly pure housing units — they can
be transplanted as a whole to
maintain a semblance of integra-
tion.

The University of Califomia at

Berkeley (who have always been
ahead of the times in social
movements), have introduced
Asian—Pacific and Hispanic
theme ﬂoors. Now dorms cannot
only be co-e'd by floor, but also
separated by floor. This way,
nasty racial incidents can be
avoided, social injustice can be
decried and no one has to live
where they have neighbors who
just don’t understand the ethnic
experience. _

By far and away, the most
advanced school in sixties nos-
talgia and 6 diversity (except for
maybe the former Yugoslavia), is
Cornell University. That’s right,
at Cornell, they have separate
houses for blacks, Indians and
recently added an Hispanic
dorm. They also have a dorm for
the ecologically minded and
artists, who, we all know, are a
special little group unto them-
selves. The president of Cornell,
Frank Rhodes, drew the line at a
homosexual dorm. He warned
that “we’re increasingly frag-
menting the campus.” Wesleyan
University, however, is much

more open-minded and interest- 7'

ed in diversity. They have
approved a “queerpositive”
house like the one Cornell reject-
ed. Oh, Mr. Rhodes, have you no
appreciation for societal trends?
Diversity means separation!

The students at Cornell have a
better insight than the adminis-
tration. I had the good fortune to
visit some friends at Cornell.
Their description of the situation
sums up the insight of the stu-
dent populace.

In the cafeterias, the students
are self-segregated. They have
their own special, uni-cultural
tables and will stare if anyone
dares to cross into their section.’
It is popular enforcement of the
unwritten code. My friends told
me that although the president
turned down the homosexual
dorm, he said the same thing
about the Hispanic dorm and
caved in after there was a large
Hispanic protest.

Recognizing that Cornell is
more Eurocentric than Pitt (if
that is indeed possible, I leave
that to the rest of terrn’s debate).
they have no formal white, or
rather, Euro-American as they

prefer__to be called, dorms. The.

‘Euro-Americans are nicely
anchored down on West
Campus, while the “integrated”
housing is up on North Campus.’

So, in
Johnathan Swift, I have a modest
proposal. Why doesn’t Pitt fol-

low suit and resegregate its.

housing? There are threetowers
to accommodate three major eth-
nic grolups.§.:Then, there is the
quad for further uni-cultural
housing, and the fringe dorms.
Lothrop and Sutherland, can be
used for single-sex floors and
other less visible minorities.

because they» are oppressed too. 9

There can be queer positive
floors, and even floors for those
fringe groups, such as those who
claim to be assimilated
Americans. artists and computer
science majors. ‘
However Pitt goes about
achieving diversity, one thing is
abundantly clear: the students
need help. They can learn to
stick to their own kind only if
they have their differences
forced down their collective
throats on a regular basis.
Despite being born sophomoric,
everyone has to attend the lovely
diversity seminars at the begin-
ning of their freshman year, but
is this enough? Absolutely not.
There must be more outlet for
collective consciousness. The
only way to achieve diversity is
to recognize our differences.
What better way than segregated
housing? By living in such units,
then we can truly realize that we
did come to college to get an
education and not bother with
such details as interacting with
each other on a personal level.

Tips for gelling the job

Cover /eﬂer first glimpse for employers

By Melanie A. Stawicki
For The Pitt News

Whether applying for an
internship or a job, chances are
you will have to write a cover
letter in the near future. Since
the cover letter is the first
glimpse a potential employer
will have of you, how you pre-
sent yourself is important.

“If you’re going to go after
an internship, which I highly
recommend, you’re going to
need to start sending your
cover letters sophomore or
junior year to potential intem-
ships,” said Maureen May, a
placement counselor at the
University of Pittsburgh.

May conceded that cover let-
ters are difficult to write at
first.

A “A cover letter is probably
more difficult for you to write

than coming up with your
resume, because it’s going to
change,” said May.

May stressed that before you
even start writing your cover
letter, it’s important to have
some career goals in mind.

“I’ve been known to send a
lot of seniors up to the career
library,” May said. “I’m sure to
the person sitting across the
desk it seems like ‘You’re
telling me to start researching
careers, I need to find a job’,
but the best way to find a job is
to know what you’re going
after.”

May also suggested “doing
your research on that particular
company or industry.”

Because of the increasingly
competitive job market, a stu-
dent must target each employ-
er’s needs to get a foot in the
door

“The key is, are you tapping
into that company’s needs?”
said May.

To find out a company’s
needs, you may be able to
research it at the library, or you
can call the company’s depart-
ment that you’re interested in,
describe to them your talents
and question if they have a
position open for someone

‘ with your skills.

Try to direct your letter to a
certain person, specifically the
one who hires in the depart-
ment or for the position that
you’re applying for.

“Possibly give that company
a call arid ask for names of
people so that you’re not writ—
ing to whom it may concern,”
May said.

Because employers receive

Upcoming graduates will

process that could get them a

could depend on how you dress

important interview.

“A first impression is always

Cindy Shimko, a recruiter for

She said if the person’s

Coming into an interview
without a professional appear-
ance could make the interview-
er wonder if the person is aware
of professionalism and if that
person will put their best foot
forward, Crawford said.

Sometimes the interviewer

can’t look beyond what is in »«

front of them to get to the char-
acter of the person, he said.

According to Kevin Collins,
a counselor at Pitt's Placement
Center, people should keep in
mind that they don’t want to
stand out. ‘

“People have a tendency to
notice things that stand out,”
Crawford said.

It is not necessary to buy a
$1,500 Armani suit or wear
jeans and a t-shirt. Neither
focus on the person’s qualiﬁca-
tions, Collins said.

Crawford said he does not

L want to notice what the person

is wearing, he would rather
concentrate on their skills and
character.

Collins said dressing “conser-
vative” is the best and safest
way to dress for an interview.

“Conservative defined is the
dark blues and greys. Usually a
white shirt or blouse,” Collins
said.

People should wear business
suits, said Crawford. “Dark col-
ors are preferred,” but darker
neutral colors would also be
ﬁne.

“I think for men a mistake
could be wearing a sport coat,”
Crawford said. He said a sport
coat would stand out among
other people whoare wearing
suits.

The only time trendiness I

would work in favor is when
the person is going into retail,
Collins said.

Even if the company is laid
back, you don’t want to show

up casual. Collins said the com-

Experience through internships helps Pitt students

By Melanie A. Stawicki
For The Pitt News

What could possibly help
you get a job after graduation
more than a 4.0 GPA? Work
experience.

And there are over 1,300
internship possibilities for Pitt
students alone.

Amy Sinciline, a senior in
sociology who graduated from
Pitt this summer, found a job
through her summer intern-
ship. She worked for the Boys
and Girls Club of Western
Pennsylvania in Carnegie this
summer for college credit.
Upon graduation, she was
offered a job with Clinton’s
newly established Americorps
Service Organization.

“In school you learn all the

academics, but you really
don’t know how organizations
operate,” said Sinicline.

Sinicline had the chance to
work with the director on the
upcoming Health Fair.

“It was a real challenge to
work on the Health Fair. At
first I was intimidated by
it, but in the end I was really
glad he trusted me with
the responsibility,” said
Sinicline.

Interns also find working in
the professional world outside
of the classroom gives them
experience in the business
world.

“It gave me an idea of how
to present myself in a corpo-
rate environment as opposed
to the usual academic require-
ment,” said Sinicline.

Elizabeth Mania, a senior
communications/interdiscipli-
nary studies major, held a
public relations internship at
University of Pittsburgh
Relations this summer.

While developing her
English writing skills, she had
the chance to personally meet
former member of Congress
Jack Kemp.

“He treated me as a profes-
sional,” Mania said. “It was
just a great opportunity that I
wouldn’t‘have had if I didn’t
have the internship.”

“With writing nowadays, an
internship is paramount to get-
ting good clips, experience
and confidence to improve in
your skill,” says Max
Jamison, a senior English
writing major.

Jamison was a summer
intern at Pitt Magazine.
Jamison worked on a few
small articles, interviews and
participated in weekly meet-
ings where he could voice any
ideas for the magazine.

“All in all I really enjoyed
it,” said Jamison.

Some departments like
English writing and engineer-
ing have their own internship
offices, and some majors even
require internships. There is
also the College of Arts and
Sciences Internship Office in
Thackeray Hall which has
over 1,300 internships on file,
guaranteeing something for

everyone. Students can also
develop their own internships.

Dick Wood, co-director of
the Office of Special Student
Programs estimated the high-
est number of interns is in the
spring with the lowest number
in the summer. Between 85
and 175 students participate in
internships each term. CAS,
as well as undergraduate
information science, students
and College of General
Studies students have held
internships through the
Internship Office.

To be considered for an
internship, CAS students must
have already earned at least 55
credits with a minimum 2.0
QPA and have completed two
courses in the department in
which they want internship
credit.

No more than six internship
credits are allowed per term
with a maximum of 12
towards graduation, and they

must work with full-time CAS
faculty. No letter grades are
received — only pass/fail
marks.

The majority of internships
are unpaid except for some
information science positions.
Instead, they offer college
credit.

Wood said internships, from
a practical point of view, help
graduates get jobs, but they
also give students a chance to
try a career and see if they like
It.

“It also gives students a
great deal of self-confidence,
self-assurance and self-
reliance, because they’ve
actually had this experience in
a real-life situation,” said
Wood.

Mania agreed. “I would
strongly recommend an
internship to give a student the
chance to try on a career with
no risk or commitment, no
strings attached.”

“Internships have almost
become a necessity now in
many fields,” said Wood.
Wood has also seen a rise in
the number of companies
wanting interns over the past
five years.

“They’ve gone up by at
least one-third in the time that
I’ve been here,” said Wood.

Evelyn Pierce, the intern-
ship coordinator at the English
writing internship office for
the summer semester, said she
has more internship openings
than she can fill.

Pierce said she had intern-
ship sponsors like the
Pittsburgh Penguins and
University of Pittsburgh
Medical Center calling her
saying, “Please send me
someone” this summer and no
students were available.

Pierce estimated that one-
third of the 35 summer intem-
ships through the English
writing internship office

turned in to either full or part
time jobs.

“I’d recommend anyone to
take an internship, because
I’ve had so many people tell
me that they’ve learned more
in an internship than they have
in three or four years of
school,” said Pierce.

“We’re now involved in
developing international
internships,” said Wood. “It’s
becoming integrated into the
study-abroad experience.”

Wood said it’s currently
possible to arrange an interna-
tional internship working with
the internship office and the
Study Abroad Office.

Looking back, now that
she’s graduated, Sinicline

- said, “If*I had to do it over

again, I would have done an
internship every semester. It’s
hard to get a job without expe-
rience, and it’s hard to get
experience coming right out
of college.”

Cover letters should be indi-

However, there is a general
pattern to writing a cover letter
that can be used by practically

Remember a good cover let-

cautioned.

May suggested three para-

explain how you heard of the

knowledge of the company.

May. Here’s where you’ll be

You will close in the final
paragraph. Indicate that you
hope for a response or that
you’ll be following up on your
application. “Depending on
your personality, your close
could be real aggressive or a
little less aggressive,” said
May.

It’s also a good idea to close
your letter anticipating a possi-
ble interview. Add which days
are best for you to meet, clari-
fying that you will be willingly
to meet whenever it’s most
convenient for them.

If you are applying to com-
panies in another area of the
country, it’s helpful to include
dates that you will be in town
for an interview.

But what if you want to
express your creativity or artis-
tic skill with your cover letter
—— should you do it and risk not
being taken seriously or not?

May said an unconventional

. cover letter is OK, as long as it
fits your personality and.

doesn’t suggest that you’re
something that you truly aren’t.

“If it fits your personality, it
works for you”, said May. “Be
yourself.”_

pany may see you as not taking
the interview or job seriously.

Crawford said it does depend
on the field, it is possible to
dress ﬂashier for a job in adver-
tising.

Helen Wilkins, news opera-
tions manager at WTAE-TV,
said the news business is a little
more casual than other fields as
well. Most people in the field
wear very casual street clothes,
and when she is interviewing
she looks for a well-groomed,
professional look.

“It doesn’t have to be a busi-
ness suit,” Wilkins said. It
could be a shirt and slacks for
men and a nice dress for
women. 1

Whatever the attire,
Crawford said, the clothing and
accessories should go together,
the clothing should be clean
and pressed and the clothing
should ﬁt properly.

“In terms ofaccessories, you
don’t want to wear a whole lot
of jewelry,” Collins said.

Collins said hair for men
should be neat, but it doesn’t
have to be military style. For
women, a style which keeps the
hair off the face is suitable.

Crawford said hairstyles should
be conservative like the attire.

Also, _it is best to avoid any
kind of overuse of perfume,
cologne or aftershave, Collins
said.

Shimko said a lot of perfume
can stick out and be distracting.

Another distraction, Collins
said, is the type of shoes worn.

“One of the easiest things to
do is shine your shoes,” Collins
said. “Recruiters I’ve talked to
have noticed [when shoes are
scuffed.]”

It is also important to wear
dress shoes instead of casual
shoes, he said.

Prior to the interview, people
should not make radical
changes to their appearance,
especially with hairstyle or
makeup. Making last-minute
changes could also be making
the person more self-conscious,
Collins said.

Collins also recommended
students don’t wait until the last
minute to get a haircut or look
for a suit. He said the whole
focus before the interview
should not be on details
of appearance, but instead
on preparing on the presenta-
tion.

Columnist mance by the
Matt Panthers, Pitt
Groff has the world
to gain if it
can pull the upset in front of
90,000 Buckeye fanatics and

the rest of the ESPN viewing
world.

This will be Pitt’s only
nationally televised game. This
limited exposure is new to a
team which made the most of
its appearances on ESPN’s
Thursday night “Game of the
Week” last year, notching two
of its three wins before a
national audience. With Notre
Dame off the schedule this
year, Pitt has lost its network
TV exposure.

Raising the stakes is the fact
that Ohio is a major recruiting
ground for the Panthers. Even
though head coach John Majors
says every game is big in
recruiting, this game is huge.
Some of Pitt’s best players,
including running back Billy
West, defensive lineman Tom
Bamdt and linebacker Gerald
Simpson hail from the Buckeye
State. In total, Pitt has 11 play-
ers from Ohio on the roster.

Ohio State, currently ranked
23rd in the nation by The
Associated Press, stands to be
Pitt’s second-most talented
opponent this year behind the
Miami Hurricanes. However,
recent developments give Pitt a
legitimate shot at an upset in
Columbus which looked fairly
impossible two weeks ago.

°Pitt scored an average of 18
points in the first half of its first
two games this season, while
Ohio State has been slow to get
its defense in order.
Washington scored 19 points in
the first quarter against the
Buckeye defense last week.

°Ohio State is having prob-
lems stopping the run, proven
by the fact that Washington
running back Napolean
Kauffman was the first person
to rush for 200 yards against
the Buckeyes since 1986.
Meanwhile, Pitt has had con-
secutive 200—yard games from
two different running backs.

°Out for the game is Ohio
State All~American and
Heisman Trophy candidate
split end Joey Galloway, due to
an NCAA suspension. This
will allow the Pitt defense to
concentrate on quarterback

Jackson restocks with

By Brady Slater
Staff Writer

Life with the Pitt baseball
program may be getting better
for head coach Mark Jackson,
but that doesn’t mean it’s get-
ting easier.

After coming to Pitt from
Point Park College in 1991,
Jackson’s Panthers have
improved from 15 wins in that
initial season to a school record
of 31 last year.

The fruits of labor.

But Jackson’s work only gets
tougher as he heads toward the
1995 season.

“We lost our entire infield,”
Jackson said of what was the
most productive 3-4-5-6 quartet
in the university’s history.

First baseman Craig Crawley,
a ﬁrst team All-Big East selec-
tion and the conference’s stolen
base leader last season with a
record 21, graduated.

Second baseman Scott Etsell,
who led the Panthers with eight
home runs while batting .304,
got married and will not be
playing because of family
obligations.

Third baseman Josh Tyler, the
Big East Player of the Year last
season, signed with the
Milwaukee Brewers after his
junior year.

And shortstop Danny
Gonzalez, the junior college
transfer who Jackson has said
was the main reason for the
team’s turnaround because of
his enthusiasm and attitude, has
played out his eligibility.

“But we feel we have some
capable guys behind them,”

Lady

I /
»,,  5

Jackson added.

He plans on having last sea-
son’s starting catcher Jon
DeBemardis work at third.

Jackson says Ed Shaffer,
Gonz'alez’s backup last year,
Jason Conti, who batted .347
while playing in the outfield last
season, and Sam Crowlay, who
redshirted last year because of a
bad back, will be vying for the
shortstop job.

And Rob Garvey, who had
four hits in 10 at-bats last year
and hit close to .500 in AAABA
ball this summer, is Jackson’s
leading candidate for the first
base job.

Second base is open, which in
theory is the status of every
position prior to the start of the
season. .

“Really all the spots are
open,” Jackson said. “I know

we’ve got some guys coming '

back that did well, but by that I
mean the guys that are coming
back will still have to work hard
and go out and do the same
things they did last year.”

And what about the guys
Jackson is bringing into the pro-
gram? Even though Brian
Shaffer is the only significant
loss from last year’s pitching
staff, Jackson named pitching as
the club’s primary recruiting
need.

So, Jackson and his staff went
out and landed three junior col-
lege pitchers as the top recruits.

These recruits are right—han-
ders Jasen Hoppa from Penn
State—Beaver and Donny Vasey
of George Wallace Junior
College in Alabama, and south-
paw Mike Rohrbach from

Pitt must replace its entire infield, including Josh Tyler (41).

Dundalk, the same Maryland
junior college Crawley played
for.

Joining those guys as scholar-
ship recruits are freshmen out-
fielders Jeff Sofran of
Pittsburgh; Johnny Phillips,
who played ball at Seneca
Valley High School; and rookie
first baseman Jeff Murse, who
is from the Lancaster area and
played ball for Manheim High
School. West Chester
University pitcher Josh Hartline
is a four-year transfer.

“When we’re looking for

By Vicki Geubtner
Staff Writer

The swishing and hissing
sounds of opening a new can of
balls was the start of the
women’s tennis match yester-
day against West Liberty State.
It was the beginning of the end
as the Lady Panthers won only
one match, leaving their season
record at 1-3.

“The scores don’t reﬂect how
close the match was,” No. 1-
seeded Alison Baker said of her
match against West Liberty’s
Kelly Brown.

Baker lost 6-0, 6-1.

“She was a tough player, and
she kept me running,” Baker
said and despite the loss she felt
she played “OK.”

Baker also doubled up with
No. 2 singles seed Marla
Zielinski with a close loss of 6-
3, 6-4. “We cut a lot of points
off at the net,” Baker said, “but
just weren’t able to get the
breaks where we needed them,”
she said.

The only winner for Pitt was
Fran Davis as she defeated
Caroline Miller in a doubles tie-
breaker match.

“She was really consistent,
and she made me make a lot of

recruits, we’re looking for a guy
who can play at this level as far
as his overall ability,” Jackson
said. “And we’re looking for all
the intangibles, which are just
as important as the ability. And
that means being coachable,
being able to play within the
system and really being dedicat-
ed to baseball, you know, to
have a passion for the game.”
Jackson uses Murse as an
example of the type of player
that he wants to add to his pro-

gram. .

good shots,” Davis said.

Her strategy was “coming up
to the net and volleying,” she
said. Davis wants to work on
trying to play more consistently.

For Zielinski she said she
needs to play “offense instead
of defense.” She lost to West
Liberty’s Sue Beathler 6-3, 6-2.

“I played [Beathler’s] game
and not my own,” Zielinski said
of her match.

"Zielinski said she needs to get
her mental game together and
stop “beating herself.”

Losing matches due to mental
breakdowns seemed to be the
only consistency with the
women yesterday.

“I always win the first set, and
then lose it mentally,” captain
Tammy Keister said. “I was
pretty disgusted with myself
that I didn’t go out and finish
the game [with a win].”

The women play at
Youngstown State tomorrow
and have confidence that they’ll
come home with a win. O

“Now that we’re on a downer
from losing today we’ll be
eager to win,” Zielinski said.

The Lady Panthers go into
tomorrow’s match with a 2-0
record over the past two years
againstthe Lady_Pe_nguins.

“A lot of people might think
that because we led the country
in s'tolen bases the last two
years, then we only recruit guys
who can run,” Jackson said.

“But Jeff is an example of a guy
that we recruited that doesn’t
really run that well. The big
thing with him is that he’s sup-

probably overachieving for their
ability,” he said. “When you
look at last year’s team, that’s
why we did so well. We had
good talent, but we had kids
who were really committed.”

‘‘If we’re recruiting some-
body and his coach says, ‘He
needs to work a little harder.
he’s not the most coachable
guy.’ then we don’t recruit that
player.”

In addition to the primary
recruits, there are a number of
non—scholarship recruits that
will be joining the Panthers this
year.

“They’re not all going to
make it,” he said. “But we hope
a number of them will help us.”

Jackson isn’t finished recruit-
ing yet either. He says he hopes
to bring in a couple junior col-
lege players for January, prefer-
ably a middle infielder and a
couple more pitchers.

Pitt’s designated hitter and
All—Big East second team selec-
tion from last season, Tyler
Shantz, and the Panthers’ best
relief pitcher last season
Clayton Beirne were January
recruits last year.

Jackson’s work is not over
yet, but his best may be yet to
come.

Column—

Bobby Hoying. Hoying is
good, but not the accurate
striker that Pitt faced in Texas
quarterback Shea Morenz.

There are still a lot of ques-
tions about whether or not Pitt
is able to beat a ranked team. A
solid game against OSU will
go a long way toward putting
those questions to rest and
helping the Panthers pounce on
Boston College to begin their
Big East schedule.

The Big East as a whole,
however, is counting on a solid
game from Pitt to bring some
respect back to the conference
after the nation watched West
Virginia get smoked by
Nebraska.

Pitt football has received
some national respect this
week in the AP poll. Pitt (l—l)
received only one vote, which
might be somewhat surprising
when one considers that West
Virginia (1-2), sporting a los-
ing record and a narrow victo-
ry over Ball State, received
eight votes.

Whether or not the Panthers
earn more votes depends large-
ly on their ability to make the
most of their Opportunities at
Ohio Stadium. And to win, Pitt
Wlll probably need key players
Curtis Martin, Reuben Brown
and Gerald Simpson to con-
tribute somehow to the game.

But everyone has seen the
Panthers’ overall improvement
this year, and a win on
Saturday would mean this
improvement is a lot closer
than most of us realized.
