ABOUNDS IN. PICTURES

Surprises I Promised Including
Snapshots of Campus Life and
Football Games.

The 1917 Owl, the annual of the
Junior class will make its bow to the
campus the first ‘part of next week.
The books are already out of the
press but it is necessary to leave them
stand in order to ensure the ﬁrmness
of th-e binding. This year’s Owl,‘ ac-
cording to present information, breaks
all records of past year books in that
it contains many new features. The
most attractive of these is the great
abundance of pictures of every kind.

It is estimated that the volume con-
tains a greater number of pictures,
snaps from university life, athletic
photographs, etc., than all previous
Owls combined. A special attempt has
been made to present campus scenery
There are eight landscape views of
the campus taken at the most effective
time-—-summer.

The art section is unparalleled in
its originality of designs.

The most prominent feature of the
section and indeed of the whole volume
is the frontispiece which is published
in this week’s issue. This is a merit-
orius work and has been warmly
praised by alumni capable to judge,
as the best piece of art that has ever
appeared in local annuals. ’

There are new photographs of Chan-
cellor McCormick, Secretary Linh-art,
and Registrar Frost and also pictures
of the Deans. This is supplemented by
a list of the personnel of the Board of
Deans——-‘at their weekly
There is an “In Memoriam” section. in
respect to those, students who have
died during the pas-t year. This com-
pletesthe introductory portion of the
volume.

At the end of the class rolls is a
folio of ten pages replete with in-
dividual pictures of some of the more
or less- prominent students, coupled
with snap shots of university activi-
ties. In the space devoted to fraterni-
ties are three pages of pictures se-
cured from promiscuous snaps of “frat”
life. In the athletic division are pic-
tures of the individual members of the
-teams, followed by eight pages of
splendid -photographs of games last
fall,.also of camp life at Windber.

Toward the end are six pages of
cartoons full of inimitable humor char-
acteristics of “Vic” Jenon’s character
sketches. There is also a resume of
the history of the class of 1917, illus-
trated by various sketches of their

Another new feature is a series ‘of

colored inserts which herald the

ties, classes, fraternities, athletics, ad-
vertising, clubs, and the Junior prom.

Washington, D. C. to Hear Pitt’s
Musicians in Brightwood M. E.
Church. '

Washington, D. C., is being toured
today by the‘ members of the Musical
Cltibs as part of the Eastern trip which
they are enjoying this week. This is
the second day for the musicians in
the Capitol and they leave for Pitts-
burgh tonight, arriving here tomorrow
morning. .

The party of thirty-four left Pitts-
burgh in charge of Manager A. S.
Haines Monday evening for Greens-
burg where they gave a concert that
evening. The regular program was
carried out to the delight of a large
audience. Many Pitt Alumni were
present. I

Immediately after the concert, the
fellows boarded a special sleeper and
made the night trip to Washington,
arriving there at eight o'clock yester-
day morning. They made their head-
quarters atgthe Hotel Richmond. The
day was spent in ’sight-seeing -and
calling on personal friends. Many of
the men visited Mount Vernon.

Last evening, the musicians made
their initial bow to a Washington audi-
ence when they appeared in the Bright-
wood M. E. Church. The pastor Lu-
cius Clark, is a close, personal friend
of George M. Kirk, the Y. M. C. A.
Secretary, through whose inﬂuence the
concert was arranged. — ,

The sigst-seeing will be continued
today and this evening. The party is
scheduled to leave Washington to-
night at 10:45 and to arrive in Pitts-
brugh tomorrow morning at 9:30.

This eastern trip will close the sea-

-son for the organization. Twenty-one

concerts have been given, in, addition

to the appearance of the quartet ‘at’

several local and almuni functions. The
annual business meeting and election

of officers will be held May 19, in 204 1

TIME-——FRIDAY NIGHT

Innovation and revolution—-—in the
fog, of feminism——-are about to over-
vg flm old Uni--that is to say, that
L  tion of it whose dean, faculty and
students fondly consider it the hub,
core and nucleus of Pitt. The process
will culminate on Friday evening in
the auditorium of the German Club, in
Craft avenue, when a. saucy golden-
haired young lady ‘named Trinetce
will prove to the assembled multitude
that “obey” has been and of right
ought to, be, stricken from the mar-
riage service forever. The occasion
of all this female perverseness is the
annual banquet of the College of Lib-
eral Arts, which will be a “leap-Year”
affair in every’ sense except the im-
portant one that the conventions of
escorts and pocket-books will still be
observed. .

The banquet, this year, will offer
all the attractions of a three-ring cir-
cus; something will be provided to
suit every taste, and the most exact-
ing. cannot grumble at the full meas-
use of entertainment and hilarity
which will be dispensed to ‘him for

expectations are in order that the

of males who have preceded her or

Tech Fraternity
I Given Phi Chapter

The installation of the Sigma Delta
Chi fraternity, a local organization at

 

— the Carnegie Institute of Technology,

as the “Phi” Chapter of the Phi Epsi-
lon Pi fraternity was helthat the Fort
Pitt Hotel Thursday evening, April 27.
The chairman of the Pittsburgh Alum-
ni Association of Phi Epsilon Pi, the
Superior of the Zeta chapter at Pitt,

_ and several New York fraters were in

charge of the installation. A banquet
for 50 guests followed at which Theo.
Len-chner acted as toastmaster. -
The Phi Epsilon Pi fraternity, be-
ing a. young organization founded in
1902, has experienced phenomenal
growth in the past few years by in-
creasing from the nucleus of ﬁve
chapters to the present roll of nine-
teen active chapters. These are situ-
ated in the colleges of the East and

- South, but progress is gradually being

made toward the West.

“Good Fellowship” Reigns Su-

preme as Students Eat, Sing
and Dance Together.

The smoker given by the Tech fel-
lows for the’ Pitt men—-the -ﬁrst of, it
is hoped, a series of “good fellowship”
meetings as an attempt to bring the
students of the two institutions into
close relationship, was a most enjoy-
able affair according to the sentiments
of the fortunate Pitt men who at-
tended.

The comfortable quarters of the Car-
negie Union, the Tech Club, were dec-
orated with the colors of the two in-
stitutions. Though it was thought the
short rain might interfere with the ex-
pected good attendance, the Union wp ,
crowded when the men settled down A
the easy chairs to enjoy the attractive
program prepared by this Techites. An
abundance of smokes was passed
around and the room was in a haze
when the chairman called for order. »

The program was voted as most
novel and entertaining. The ﬁrst num-
ber was the Tech “bull ﬁght” in which.‘
two men blindfolded lay on the stage
and with paper clubs sought in vain
to strike his opponent’s cranium.

The attempt of theparticipants to
ﬁnd the location of the other were
funny and kept the audience in an up-
roar. A

The next event was a zither solo by
a renowned Count Von Weber, which
though less strenuous than the previ-
ous number was no less enjoyed.

This was followed by a barrel box-
ing match in which two well greased
..=hoists-series...sIsvss.... . .. 
which a liberal ‘portion of stove’ polish
had‘ been applied, slugged each other
while standing in barrels. This proved
too tame and the contestants went at
each other according to Marquis of
Queenstbury rules. .

A couple of comedians helped and
this part of the program was con-
cluded wit some skillful (1') card
tricks by 0 e Goldstein.

The smokers now ﬁled out to the
‘_‘Beanery” where some “eats” put them
in ﬁne condition,

The chairman announced that a sur-
prise awaited the men and on going
back to the club room they found the
Carnegie Musical clubs, having just
returned from a concert. Some se-
lections were rendered by. the Glee
club and the Mandolin men. Vocal
solos and some Hawaiian instrumental
solos were given.

Yells were given frequently between
the numbers on the program led by
Dodds of Pitt and Merrill of Tech.

States, President of the {Student
Senate responded to the cordial wel-
come giventhe Pitt men by the chair-
man. It is hoped that we will be
able to entertain our neighbors in like
manner in the future. '

  LOOKING’ ’EMi OVER  
Our only solace-—Wait until the»
Gold and Blue Panther eleven gets a.

chance to make up for all these kicks
the Orange teams are handing us. V

At that Pitt has no excuse. Tom
Kean’s has a well rounded team, and
one that could hold its own with any
in intercollegiate_cir_cles. *

Remember when we used to stand
around the campus, and from our
measly 5 ft. 8 or 9 inches, would gaze
up with awe and admiration at the
huge hulks of such athletes as Sies,
Sutherland, Soppitt, and the rest. ‘But
these men compared to some repre-
senting Syracuse Saturday, were more
pigmies. Whitei,s interc-olle~gi.a.te cham-
pion 56 lb. weight thrower,stands 6» ft.
6% inches in" his stocking feet and
strips around 270. Cobb, like Wlhite
also a. football, star, tops the scale
around 235 or 40, j

One of the Syracuse men remarked
that if we thought these chaps were
big we ought -to see Schlachter, their
All-American guard. ‘ But we have our
doubts as ‘to whether he has anything
on. ‘White. * Incidentally “Big Bill” Hol-

_mousHPeni1 State teams, is‘ already on
the job at Syracuse, and has ‘a squad
of over 30 out working every day.
.When thei'refere‘e’s whistle blows next
fall, starting the Pitt-Styracuse affair,
-we have ajfaint idea that -the present
European episode will take on '-the com-
parative qualities ofa. pink tea affair.

A funny ‘thing, tho, this two smallest
men in the shot-put, Schultz and Fry,
ﬁnished first and second respectively.
You nevercan tell. i , V r

A veritable’ avalanche of protests
have been received from the’ Economic
.studen‘»ts,' demanding that we retract
the statement that Sies is 5 in the
,School»§‘of".E_d.‘. our‘ only’ alibi is to
blame it on-‘one of the’ cubs.‘ ‘(Funny
-thing, tho, not a glimmer of a kick
from the Ed. School. in

The.interde;partme,nt track -and ﬁeld
meet was the most“ successful ever
heldat the University. Every school
had every man out that it could pos-
sibly get, and. as final resultsshowed,
it was the third, fourth and ﬁfth places
that ﬁnally returned ‘V the Economic
School the victor. The Dents were a
sadly disappointed‘ ‘bunch, but they
have nothing to be ashamed of as their
entrants ca.ptui’redj_not, less than eight

The rumor that baseball may be
dropped as" a Varsity sport in the Uni-
versity has caused much ‘comment
both in school and in the newspapers.
Quite «a few of the sporting writers
seem, to favor_it,‘ while the opinion
of the student body is mostly one of
indifference- This very spirit of dis-

reasons that has been advanced by
those in favor of dropping it. What "
is your opinion? Let us hear from
the student body on this question.

moon on  

Pitt and Tech will again line up
against each other when the track
teams of the two institutions meet in
a dual meet on Schenley Oval Satur-
day.. Judging by the formshown by
the two teams so far this year,‘ Pitt
should have little trouble in winning
from their friends across the way.
The Pitt team‘ this year is the best
all-around one that has ever competed
for ‘University, while the Plaid ‘team,
although having a number of individ-
ual stars on its list, will still have to
show a decided improvemient in form
if theywish to hold the Gold, and
.B1ue‘score down. A it
 Tech has some mighty good men’ in

‘the sprints in Smith, I-Iemman and

Russell. These’ three men are all
good in“ the shorter distancies and
‘should make the Pitt men hustled in
order to break the tape infront of
them. Reister, Lawson and Moore
are the Tech entrants in the mileand
half mile, while Andersoniand Walker
will compete in the two-mile run. '
Adams is putting the shot around 39
feet for the tohenlgeyi-tes and should
come close to winning that event. In
the other ﬁeld events .Pitt’s men
should have nodiﬂiculty in winning.
Despite the defeat suffered at the
hands of the Syracuse team, the.

_chances for a. successful season on the

track are better than they have ever-

U.imeet, surpassed the old record by
2%, inches. The other record to fall

well in the same meet in which-’ Hugus

the - Blue and Golders in the
rigid, test of the next few days.
Matson will do most , of the work
behind the bat, while Freidlander will
be on hand as a relay. The work will
fall the heaviest upon the pitching staff
for Eddie Langdon, and “A1” Hartwill
-have to bear the L’ heaviest’ portion of
the work. It is almo.st certain, how-
ever that Kennedy will work in one
of the games with “Boots” ‘Reihl as
his helper while in a pinch an oppor-
tunity will be given Alvin Hoch to
show his steel under ﬁre.

This trip will be an unusually dif-
ﬁcult one for the teams that» are
scheduled, will be one of the
strongest in the college ﬁeld
this year. a Lafayette T fell an
easy mark before the superb Work
of, “Lefty” Langdon in the game at
Forbes'Field,Lbut the oppositionis sure
to be of a. stiff nature in the‘T*5game at
Easton and the ability ofthe Ea'ston-
ites cannot be denied asis shown by
the earlier win over Cornell, Navy, and
other ﬁrst class aggregations. West

Point is stronger this year than ever.

hurling corps. T 
L T The Annapolis organization has tak-
en the scalps of the greater number
of its opponents and numbersamong
its victims teams of. such strength as
that of Pennand then holds the initia-
tive over the Pittsburgh aggregation
by the virtue of thewin last year.
The ﬁnishing game with Bucknell
will not be in the’ nature of a cinch
either. The Lewisburg men have the
strongest aggregation that has repre-
sented their institution in yea.Lrs_ and
they have been setting things aﬁre. in
their league so that a ﬁne sharp snag
may be awa.itin:g the Blue and Gold.
supporters when they brace up against

...the- Baptist Diamond experts.

The general impression seems to be

L that the trip will be considered a. suc-

cess if the team, manages to break
even. But then the men may not be

L able to carry home that proportion of

thegames and again it may be a repe-
tition of theLE’astern basket ball trip
in which the quintet dished out ‘a
surprise to its constituents athome.

In any event the trip will be regarded T
in the light of a success should they

manage to pull an even break from
the toss up with the formnable aggre-
they are
stacked up against.  L

The next speaker was Mr.'John B.

spoke on the “Impregnable Islam.”.
Mr. Keena told of the supremacy of
Islam from the sixteenth to the twen-

through strife and slaughter, and the
progress gained since the fall of Con-
stantinople. The dethroning ‘of Islam
is the only way to stop these massa-

this, and the millions of gmurdered“

a candy sale in State Hallon Friday,’

May 5. The affair was a suoces.sI
from all standpoints,’ particularly--the
ﬁnancial one. Every box of candy was
sold and all who were purchasers

were delighted with the deliciouscon-,

tents of the little packages. It was

‘ a. misfortune /that the ’ girls had not

a greater supply on hand for they
certainly would have -sold‘ ‘it all. As‘

Groetzinger and ' her
through whose efforts the affair was
arranged and made such a success.

The next and last speaker on the
program was Mr. John William Lewis,-
of Colgate College. Mr. Lewis took
for his topic, “A Legacy in Danger.”
“There is one class of -men,” said Mr.
Lewis,~“who believe in peace, but not
in armament or preparation. Others
believe in peace because they see no
danger to fear. We havea national
heritage which has been hlandedi down
to us, and which must -be upheld even
at the cost of peace. Our ‘policy has
been one of indecision and delay. Our
legacy demands the protectionof the
weak. What have we done in the
The United States
raised not a single word of protest,
because we were not prepared, and
"therefore powerless to make our voice
respected. The on1y,,course open to
us is preparedness. Not for aggres-
sion, but for self-defense. We must
do this 7 in ~Qrder that our ideals may
live.” I  D *
