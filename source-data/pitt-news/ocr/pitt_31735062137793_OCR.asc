- Last Wiedniesdaythe annual battle
between the Sophomores and Fresh-
men of the University took place.
From the opening day until VVednes-
day theer was a feeling of anxiety
around sch0ol,ivf'or the ‘Freshman
class, more than two hundred and

"ﬁfty strong, had vowed publicly to

wipe up the cobwebs and accumulated
dust of summer with ‘the remnants of
the Sophomore class. The \Sophs,
‘having fears and with grounds that

such would be the case, decided to

havethe ﬁght before the Freshmen
were- organized. —

The Freshmen showed their\ class
Tuesday afternoon by evading the

‘wily Sophs and holding their class

meeting in the Gayety. They de-
cided on their line of attack.and pro-
ceeded at once to put it into execu-
tion. In theimeantime the Sophs cap-
tured the Fresh leader, -spirited him

* Horrors! The c‘oeds have taken up

« class ﬁghts to put in the time at lunch

hour, according to the reports of a

‘few lucky fellows who happened to

be around Thaw Hall ‘noon hour last
Friday.

According t'o reports the “Soph”
girls tried to persuade the “Fresh”
coeds to wear green hair ribbons; but

—the Fresh would not be persuaded-

and the ﬁght was on. It was no “pink
tea” affair. The “Fresh”_ contingent

' simply mussed up the Sophs at a great

rate, and only by outside aid were
the Sophs saved from complete anni-
hilati'on. One young lady became so
frightened when the battle was at its
height, that she madea double quick
retreat to Bayard street via a chapel
window and a ladder.

No inside details were available
from those inrthe conflict. Nonue was
reported seriously injured; but sev-
eral chairs were broken and a door
knocked from its - hinges. ’

’ The Fresh say they‘will wear no,

green ribbons, and will surelyrepulse
the Sophs again if theygtry to force
them to wear_tl1_e green ribbons.

‘a good deal, the en are slowly

mainder of theweek to scrimmage in
it is thought will put the team in con-
dition for the VVes-tminster game of
next Saturday. During the first two
weeks of practice no scrimmage was
indulged in, but last Tuesday ‘a stiff
scrimmage was held and, judging
from the liinps and scratches exhib-
ited by s-ome of the men, it must have
been a good one.

It is too early to give a lineup f’or.

Saturday’s game, but it is probable
that the following men. will start the
ﬁrst quarter: .Center, Galvin; guards,
Williams and Blair; tackles. Steven-
son and Gehlert or Feightner; ends,
Capt. Lindsay and Soles or Graves;
quarterback, Dewar; halves, Dillon or
Quailey and Brown; full, Wagner. It
is Safe to predict that Connelly will
be tried at quarter before the game

Secure Positions

New Student Employment Bureau
Opens Auspiciously. O i

 

The_new Bureau of Student Em-
ployment of which A. R. Hamilton is
chairman and Karl Davis secretary,
‘has made a very auspicious start by
securing positions for about twenty-
five students on the election returns.
The men were required to ‘secure the
results in the different precincts and
report them. The new bureau has
been remarkably successful in secur-
ing these positions for the students.

Mr. Davis, when asked what ‘the
Student Employment Bureau, would
be able to do, refused to make a state-
ment now, but said-that in a few days
he would beable to inform the stu-
dents how they might secure jobs. He
expressed himself as very well pleased

Sophomore President Is Captured-
Over Fifty Freshmen Bound
By Sophs.

The night before the class scrap the
Freshmen sprang a big surprise upon
the Sophs-by capturing the 1914 class
president. A party of twenty or more
Freshmen with an automobile lay in
wait for the .upper classman at the
school until long toward midnight,
when the much dressed man ventured
forth and was captured after a brief
but hard struggle, Tied, gagged and
shackled, he was hurried to a barn sev-

Many of the lower class were in-

got off the cars and sent right back
t'o the city. The one-year men were
extremely successful in reducing the

Great Praise Given Dean
of Pitt Engineering ‘

of Mich. Alumni‘

Dr. M.‘ E. Wadsworth, Dean of the
School of Mines, who is loved and
respected by all the Pitt undergrads

and alumni, was signally honored at
the reunion exercises of Michigan Col- ..

lege -of Mines, Houghton, Michigan,
held during the week of August 6. Dr.
Wadsworth was director ‘of that _in-

stitution for 12 years, from 1887 to

1899, an-d built it up to a high stand-
ard, just as he is now doing with our
own School of Mines. When he took
charge of the school the attendance
totaled 23 students; in 1899, when he
resigned, the number ‘had increased
to! 116. To-dayiMichiganIC_olege of
Mines is one of the foremost institu-

Physician Dies in    

His Ninetieth Year  

One of the oldest practitioners in
the United States and one of the best
known physicians in the county, Dr.
Joseph Hervey Reynolds,’ died last
night at his home, No. 21 Spraguve
avenue, Bellevue. Had he lived until
next Tuesday he would have reached
the age of 90 years. He practiced
medicine for over 60 years and to
within a few days of his death.

Dr. Reynolds waS_regarded as one
of the most extraordinary men iden-
tiﬁed with his profession. Possessed

of a wonderful constitution, an iron

will and a strong desire to ever keep
alert in his calling, he entered the
Western University, now the Univer-
sity of Pittsburg, when nearly*80, to
take a special course, and received a
diploma. His only purpose was tore"-

knowledge. , _ I
One.of his strongest traits was a
‘powerful memory. It is said that he

THE PITT WEEKLY’

Warning.  

It has been rumored that afpagan,
punky, pasty, parasitic party of bi-
peds having departed fromitheir pa-
ternal ClOITllClllCS, thinking their blink-
ers sufﬁciently peeled by nameless
numskulled profs of preps, are now
seeking wisdom within the venerable
walls of old Pitt. It now behooves
the most glorious class of 1911, the
pride of the university, the standard
of excellence, pursuing the time-h‘on-
ored customs, to hereby most frac-
iously convdescend to grant unto these
accursed nimcompoops, known as
Fres'hmen, the following mandates:

Take heed, therefore, that ye shall
at all times leave with mamma all
osculating glassware, go-cart appen-
dages—meaning nurses and other ac-
complishments of the fosterage. That
ye damnable creatures are not human;
therefore, have no rights, civilly,
socially or morally. That ye conglo-
bate mass of inﬁnitesimal insigniﬁ-
cance shall on all occasions wear upon

thy empty cranium the official green,

cap of the Freshman. That ye shall
immediately desist from wearing any

prep school pins or numerals, for any

violation of this rule shall be dealt
with in a manner most unnatural and
hellish. That ye female progeny
whom fate has decreed to be mem-
bers ‘of, this motly throng, shall
always wear thy outgrowth of the
epidermis—meaning hair—in such a
manner as will hereby be decreed by
our beautiful and talented co-eds— i.
e., in such a fash'on as is homogenious
to the tails of the lowly swine. That
ye shall always_attend the football
games an-d all other occurrences of
this university. Ye shall mix in with
the bunch and do your damnedest in
rooting for this dear old Pitt.

Wherefore, when ye emerald sons
of jassacks have fully digested the
foregoing pellicles, wh'ch shall guide
you in the First Year of your verdancy
recollect also

That the “Gayety” is no place for
Freshies to raise h—l. L

That there is a place in Chapel for
Freshmen.

That the “smoking room” is no
place for ye damned Fresh to l-oaf.

And now if ye would escape eternal
punishment indicated by this imperial
edict, obey, ye vile yellow cre-a-tu1‘€S;
ye accurse-d Kids of 1915, your super-
iors—the Class of 1914.

Fire and Brimstone awaits thee, ye
vile Masculine Outcasts of Mephis'to—
p*heles.

A special effort will be made dur-
ing the next tendays by myself and
several other fellows to reach every
student possible and enroll him in the
Y. M. C. A. A

The Y. M. C. A. is, like every other
student organization, dependent for
its success on the students of the
University. And the Y. M. C. A.
should not ‘ask any student to join
unless the Y. M; C. A. can give that
student s-ome benefit. This year I,
as President of the Y. M. C. A., pledge
myselfto every student that joins the
Y. M. C. A., that I will make an ear-
nest effort to see that he gets a ben-
eﬁt from joining.

I want every man, who is square
and honest, and deserves the respect
of his fellowmen, to join the Y..'M.
C. A., whether his efforts along the
line of active religious work are very
great or very small. We need every
man in the University and we think
we can help every man that joins.

There are a great many things the
Y. M. C. A. can do in University life
ifgthe students will rally" around.‘ Let
yourself get a closer knowledge of
your college Y. M. C. A., and,the Y.
M. C. "A. of you, and then you, the Y.
M. C._ A. and the Universitylwill be
aided and made stronger. / '

Come’/out;‘join the Y. M. C. 
give us a fair chance; and T will, as
President, make every effort ‘to see
that we do the right thing by you, and
will give earnest attention to any sug-
gestions offered for-the betterment of
the association.

Don’t knock before you have given
the Y. M. C. A. a fair trial. You can’t
strengthen the association by staying
out and saying how p'oor the Y. M.
C. A. is. Perhaps the very things in
the association that you ridicule, are
there because you never joined and
helped to remedy ‘the weak spots.

DR. BRASHEAR IN SCOTLAND.

Pitt Represented at Great Anniver-

T sary in Glasgow.

Dr. Brashear, one of the World's
leading scientists, was the repre-
sentative of the University of Pitts-
burgh at the ﬁve hundredth anni-
versary of the founding of St. An-
drew’s University, at Fife, in Scot-
land. There were representatives
from Yale, Harvard, Cornell, U. or
P., Columbia, Michigan, New York
State, Chicago, John Hopkins and
other of America’s leading colleges
and from‘ the leading colleges of all
the various European -countries.
Among the notable addresses were
those of the Chancellor of St. An-
drews, of Lord Balfour and of An-

drew Carnegie, who ,was formerly

Lord Rector of St. Andrews. The
king sent a congratulatory message
to the University. It will not be

long to Pittsburgh's celebration of
‘.her own one hundred and‘ twenty-

ﬁfth anniversary and. efforts, are

being- made vigorously and. loyally

Evening School of Economics, Ac-.

‘ ‘counts and Finance.

In the Evening School on unusu-
ally. heavy enrollment is assured.
Eachfof the classes In this school
meets one evening a week, and en-
rollment will not be. completed‘ for
two weeks or more. The present
outlook promises an enrollment of

more than double that of last year. A

The Dean has been active during the
late Summer months in bringing to
the attention ofﬂboth the employer
and the employe the opportunities
which the Evening School offers to
ambitious young men who are em-
ployed during the day and so are un-
able to pursue regular college work,
but who feel the need of further
study and training, especially along
lines of business science. Employers
have shown marked interest in this
work, and have expressedia desire
to co-operate with the Evening
School. In many cases they have
asked for copies of the Evening
School bulletin for distribution
among their office men and sales-
men, and have urged them to use
this opportunity to prepare them-
selves for positions of larger useful-
ness and responsibility with the ﬁrm,

In response to a wide demand
three new courses are giventhis
year in the Evening School: Ra.il-
way economics, a. study of modern
transportation and related problems;
Business English, a. course designed
to give command of correct and
forceful English for ousiness pur-
poses, such as correspondence, circu-
lars, prospectuses, advertising, etc.

Freshman Class Double That of Last
Year-——300 on Grant Boule-

~ vard. -

The University has opened all de-
partments withitlie greatest enroll-
ment inthe history of the “school.
The Freshuman class of this year bids
fair to‘ be almost doublethat of last
yeah

From present indications the fresh-
men liiniwthe college willunumber at
least 110, while the engineering
school will have a similar number.
The economics department will have
in the neighborhood of 50, while the
schools of education and mines will
have about 30 new students. Acon-
servative estimate places the Fresh-
man class in these ﬁve departments
alone between 250 and 300 in num-
ber.

In the pharmacy and dentistry
schools the increase was so great
that the dentistry students were re-
moved from their, old quarters on
Bluff street and their place turned
over to the pharmacy men. The
dentistry men were transferred to
the old location of the medical de-
partment on Brereton_ avenue. The
same rate of increaseis found in all
of the other professional schools.

1 The numbers of the ’15 men in all
departments is about double that of
the '14. men,. so a very interesting

time is promised those enjoying class "

ﬁghts. ‘The Sophs. evidently have

THE FOOTBALL SEASON.

 

Many students have asked the foot-
ball management concerning the pros-
,'pects for a winning team this year.
We believe that if the students do
their share they can answer such _ques-
tions themselves. Every man who is
not attending classes from 3 :30 in the
afternoon should turn out 'to watch
the team practice. Show you are in-
terested. Only the m‘ollycoddle stay
around the smoking room and “hope”
we hav-e a good "team. Every man
with so much as an ‘ounce of back-
bone will take the time to turn out for
practice. ~

Besides attending ‘practice, the men
should practice their cheers and yells.
There are a large number of new men
with us this year who are n'ot familiar
with our songs. Cheering practice_
should have been held every day this

. week and several days last week in

order to pr-epare for our ﬁrst‘game—
that with Westminster this Saturday.
Througlh some misfortune these much
needed rooter meetings have been ne-
glected and consequently we have

_ much to do between this and Satur-

if us start tihese rooter meetings and .

day. Rooters’ meetings should be
started with every man present—spe-
cially the Freshmen. Theﬁrst man
who does n'o-t attend should be [forced
to come. if the whole school and the
Oakland police force have to hunt him.
No quitters are wanted here. ‘So let

give the team a great send-off when.
we line up against Westminster.

THE CLASS FIGHT

 

The class ﬁght this year was one of
the best we hav-e ever seen. Con-
ducted in a clean, sportsmanlike man-
ner, fought to the ﬁnish by both

classes, it furnished a ﬁne illustration.

of what class -rivalry should be. One
of the most pleasing features of this
year’s S‘ophomore~Freshm-en contest
was the class spirit which it devel-

oped. Both classes were full of class

loyalty and this made the contest in-
teresting. For without class spirit
there can» be but little college loyalty.

., It is_ in the class that the college spirit

is developed. This feature of our -col-
lege activities should‘ be greatly
strengthened this year with so good
a start. Care, however, must be taken

‘that this wholesome class rivalry shall

not end through negligencef, It will
fall to the upper classes to thereby or-
ganize the under classes and to foster
the loyalty which has so well been
started.

In this issue a notice is published
concerning -the work of one of the
student clubs. A request is made for
a large number of candidates at the

At dinner in a small town in Scot-
land it was found that every one had
contributed to the evening’s entertain-
ment but a certain Dr. McDonald.

“My voice is altogether unmusical,

and resembles the sound caused by
the act of rubtbing bnicks along the
panels of a door.”
' The company attributed this to the
doctor’s modesty. Go'od singers, he
was reminded, always needed a lot of
pressing.

“Very well,” said the doctor, “if
you can stand it I will sing.”

Long before he had ﬁnished his au-y

dience was uneasy. There was a" pain-

ful silence as the doctor sat down,

brokenat length bythe voice of a
candid Scot at the end of the table.

“Man,” he exclaimed, “your singin’s
no up to much, but your veracity’s
just awful. ’You’re richt about that

the reunion, show that “Poppy” has
n-ot only recently acquired the habit
of being a “good scout” among the
undergrads. He had that reputation
up at State College, we all know, and
we also know how soon he won a way
down deep in our hearts at Pitt. Evi-
dently Michigan College of Mines’
men entertain the same opinion of
him.

Under the heading “College Gradu-
ates Pay Tribute to Dr. Wadsworth
—-—Former President of Institution Is

Highly Honored at Alumni vMeeting,”'

the following apeared in the Hough-
ton papers: ~

“Director Wadsworth, who headed
the school for 12 years from 1887 to
1899, was-called on by the gold grad-
uates to talk while theivote was being
taken. He came forward beaming,
rested his hands on the rail of the
platform, looked -down at the expec-
tant faces and said, ‘What do you
want me to talk about?’:'

“ ‘Tell us how you did it, Doctor,’
shouted some one and the cry was
taken up.

“So _Dr. Wadsworth told them how‘

he did it, how he made the mining
school ‘over from little better than
nothing into one of the foremost min-
ing colleges in the world. It was a
simple tale, mostly of hard work and
careful painstaking effort. He told
of his ﬁrst year at the college, be-
ginning with his arrival in Houghton
on a dark rainyinight just ten days
before the term was to open. The fac-
ulty consisted of three _men including
the director, one of these had resigned
and another was in parts unknown.
There was no record of the previous
years’ work at the school, no list of
stludents, nothing but an announce-
ment that the course mf instruction
must be of two years’ duration.

“He spoke gratefully to the help re-

' ceived from R. C. Pryor, then .a stu-

dent at the school,‘ and of the, im-
mense amount of work d-one by R. M.
Edwards, who became a member of
the staff. The quarters of the college
were a few rooms in the basement
and on the top ﬂoor of the Houghton
ﬁre hall. Continuing he outlined the
development of the school, the

change from the two to the three.

years’ course, from the three to the
four, and from the four -to its present
state, the electric system. A

“He also credited the Michigan Col-
lege of Mines with being the origin-
ator of what has come to be called
the Chicago System, whereby the
school consists of 45 weeks instead of
the usual 36.. This system was orig-
inatd by the Michigan Mining School
two years before its adoption by the
University of Chicago, after which it
has c‘ome to _be named. The Michigan

Mining School was also the ﬁrst tech— ,

nical school to adopt the elective sys-
tem. After the conclusion of the doc-
tor’s address tribute was paid him by
several of the men who graduated
under him, who addressed the assem-

blaze-‘V. '

 

‘Michigan College of Mines.

Another paper made this comment 2,
"‘A dinner in honor ‘of Dr. M. E.
VVadsw.or.th of Pittsburg, Pa., dean of
the Pittsburgh School of Mines, and
former president of the Michigan Col-.
lege of Mines, was given at the
Houghton club last night. Dr. Wads-
worth was the guest of more ‘than
half a hundred of prominent mining
men from all‘ parts of the United
States, men who had received degrees
from the Michigan College of Mines
at his hand. These men -had duning

Noble Science, This.

There is a new science called mne-
monies, which is trying to get. itself
intorduoed into our public‘sch’ools.
We have no knock on’ this .science—.
only it seems to us to be a. rounabout
way of arriving at facts that you
ought to remember right off the bat.
It appears to work something in this
manner:

“When was Lincoln born?” asks the
teacher.

“I—I f-f-forget,” whines th-e pupil.

“Naturally you do. G0 at it right.
How many Muses are there in myth-
ology?” '

“Nine.”

“Right. Now double that number."

“Twice-nine’s-eighteen.”

“Right again. Multiply it by 100.”

“I800.”

“Good. All the number of Muses
to that.”'

“I809.”

“Aha! That's when Licoln was

b'orn. Why don’t you learn the scien-
tiﬁc way of geting at these things?”
As we said in the ﬁrst place it's a

noble science,'but~we’d rather remem- ‘

A." Announcements Made. A

The regular chapel exercises were

. held last _Friday in the chapel in "Thaw

Hall. Am'ong the announcements
made the following are of interest. An
effort is being made to organize a
student band and a meeting was held
immediately following chapel for that
purpose. '

Chancellor McCormick stated that
he most heartily endorsed this. plan;
that he had advocated the idea ever
since he became chancellor; and that
he h'oped that it would now be a suc-
cess. The proposed band will play
at the football games and at the va-

-rious student functions.

Announcement was made concern-
ing the opening meeting of the Y. M.
C. A., which’ was held last Monday.
An earn-est effort is being made by
the Y. M. C.  leaders to build up
the otrganizations on a solid, ﬁrm
basis. At a cabinet meeting the fol-
lowing explanation was made con-
cerning the purposes of .a  M. C.
A. in general, and the Y. M. C. A. of
U. of Pittsburg in particular. A Y.
M. C. A. has three general purposes
——to develop a" man -mentally, spirit-
ually-and physically. The college Y.
M. C. A. is in a slightly different posi--
ti'on. Being a student at college, his
mental development is cared for.

The Y. ‘M. C. A. ..2f the University
of Pittsburgh has no gymnasium at
the present time and no prospects of
obtaining -one for some considerable
time. Moreover, the college gym will
be ﬁnished shortly and it will provide
for_the physical development. There-
fore, there remains one thing left and
it the most important to the college
man of the present (lay-—-namely, his
spiritual development. To this it is
the -intention and endeavor of the
workers of the Pitt Y. M. C. A. t'o
devote their attention.

The Chancellor also stated that the
ﬁrst general meeting of all the stu-
dents would be held to-day at 11:30
o’clock in the Soldiers’ Memorial
Hall. Monday and Friday will be held
open for student meetings as far as
possible.

defects. He ‘held-steadfast to the be-
lief that the cause should be doc-t‘ored
rather than the slilment itself. He
aimed to remove the cause and it is
said that therein lay ‘his success.
When during the last few days it was
announced that the doctor could not
live, friends and patients stopped at
his home by the score" to inquire as
to his condition and there was sorrow
in many homes when it was announced
that “the good old doctor,” as many
were prone to call him, was dead.

Dr. Joseph Hervey Reynolds was
born October 3, 1821, in the Chartiers
valley, not very far from what is now
McKees Rocks. As he reached his
majority his parents moved to near
Woodville.

He entered Adrian College, Adrian,
M.ich., from which institution he also
received .a diploma. He also took a
course in the New York P'ost-Gradu-
ate Medical School, received honors
at Bellevue Hospital and took a spe-
cial course in the Western University
of Pitsburg. He married a Miss Haz-
lett many years ago. They had two

children, a s-on and daughter, the son ‘

being Dr. Edward S. Reynolds, of
Bellevue, who died about 10 years
ago. Following the death of Dr. Jo-
sep*h Hervey Reynold’s. ﬁrst wife, he
some years later married Miss Alice
Kitchen, of the North Side, who sur-
vives him, together with two grand-
child-ren—thue children of Dr. and Mrs.
E. S. Reyn'olds, Harry H. Reynolds
and Mrs. Luella Reynolds Richardson,
both of Bellevue, who were at his bed-
side when the end came. Dr. Reyn-
olds was a member of the staff of the
Presbyterian Hospital.

The do-ctor a few weeks ago re-
marked to friends that ‘he believed he
was good for 100 years and was so
wrapped up in his profession that he
wanted to live, that he might do
others good. He was a member of
the Bellevue Presbyterian Church,iof
which the Rev. R. M. Little is pastor.
He had practiced medicine in Belle-
vue for 31 years.

Having been born and raised so
close to Pittsburg, he knew much
about the early history of the eityi
He greatly aided the Historical So-
ciety three or four years ago. He
said one reason why Market street is
so narrow was because two ﬁshermen
on the wharf quarrele’d over their 1'0-
cations, each refusing to move, with
the result that the street was laid
out its present width. Dr. Reynolds
also was active in New York more
than a half a century ago, during the
cholera, and gave valuable aid at a
most gritical time in the c'ountry’s his-
tory. ,

4' Trip to I Cornell

When Manager Hurst announced
that Pitt would play Cornell at Ithaca
on Saturday, October 28th, many stu-
dents, alumni and other Pitt adher-
ents immediately said they expected

to “seethat game” and made plans

accordingly to go. The regular fare
to Ithaca is $8.34'one way, but the

P. & L. E. R. R. has gi_ven a rate of
$13.20 round trip for a party of ten
or more. A d'ouble lower berth from
Pittsburg to Ithaca is $2.50 and the
rate for an upper is $2.00. A schedule
of train time is appended.

'iNow, fellows, we want to BEAT
CORNELL and wewant every fellow
who can raise'the money to go. We
want to show Cornell what a loyal
student ‘body We have at Pitt and the
only Way we can do this is to take up

,C,0a-ch Thompson realizes that the
coming game with Westminster will
not be an easy" one as the New VVil-
mington players put up a splendid
game against Pitt last year, and lose
but three of their last year's team.
Westminster played a practice game
last Saturday, and the members of the
Pitt team, as well as the students,
were sorry to learn that Capt. Man-
sell of the college sustained a broken
ankle, wh.ich will keep ‘him out of the
game for the remainder of the season.
Mansell is a splendid player and was
a stumbling block for Pitt last year;
his loss will be greatly felt by West-
minster, particularly in her next
game.

Much surprise was expressed, by
management and students when it
was learned that Buchtel College had
cancelled the game to be played here
on November 14. The cause given by
them was that the faculty had decided
that the manager had gone out -of
Buchtel’s class in signing Michigan

Agricultural College and Pittsburgh,

and thattthese games must be can-
celled. The loss of this game caused

. Graduate Manager Hurst a great deal
. of trouble, as it was absolutely neces-
. sary to -play oniNovember 14 in order

to give the team experience for the

day. No game has been signed as

a remarkably fast game of football.

Arrangements had been completed
t'o play the first two games at D. C.

was able to obtain Forbes Field for
these games. It was a good move to
make this change, as D. C. and A. C.

“GETTING, A LIGHT.”
(Exchange)

The eternal problem of “getting a
light” has at last been solved. No
more will the upper cllssmen have to
ﬁsh unsuccessfully through several
pockets in search of a match, then seek
for -several minutes among similarily
situated" students. Now all that is
necessary is to ﬁnd the familiar green
button and ask the wearer for a
match. He will have it.

This state of affairs was brought
about by several upper classmen wh'o
met and decided that the Freshmen
in addition to observing the regular
Freshmen rules would be compelled to
carry at all times a supply of matches
which were to be delivered at the re-
quest of some upper classmen. The
idea met with instant approval and
from now on -will be incorporated in
the list of Freshmen rules.

cided to’ let. well enough alone. Two
P. M. was the time appointed for the
official opening of hostilities. Rain
had been falling the greater part of
the day, but the ardor of the contest-
ants was not dampened.

The first event, a series of wrestling
matches, was called and referred by
“Doc” Walgren, the well—known ath-
lete. This event was exciting and at-

tracted a large number of spectators. .

The Freshmen succeed in winning the
series. One match, the international,
between a Greek and a Hindu, was
h'otly contested. During -this match
the spectators crowded on the ﬁeld
to such an extent that the referee was
compelled to call time to force the
crowd back, The Greek won the

match. The next event on the pro— P

gram, the tying contest, was won by
the Sophs. A number of Freshmen
opposed an equal number of Sophs.
Each side was provided with rope, the

objective point being to tie the other‘

side up. The -rules of the contest
were that not more than two men
were to engage in tying another up.
This event was scrappy throughout,
although n’o dirty‘work was indulged
in. Class spirit boiled over to such
an extent in this event that after it
was over the ground resembled a
freshly plowed ﬁeld. The Freshmen
looked as if a tornadoihad struck
them .amidships. The Freshmen had
more "grit in them as hostilities pro-
gressed. It was ground into them.

The sand bag contest, the free for
all, followed and concluded the pro—
gram. The Sophs were given posses-
sionof the sand bags and the Fresh-
men the privilege of taking them from
them. This was where the S-ophs

showed their sand. After a prolonged.

struggle the superiority of the mighty
S'ophs was unquestioned. The ground
was strewn with pieces of clothing of
all descriptions. One bedraggled
Soph was taken for a Freshmen. The
Freshmen retired, dirtier, sadder and
wiser, but loyal Pitt men, and peace
was restored for another year; Sum-
maries: Sophs, 821/2; Freshmen, 17%.
