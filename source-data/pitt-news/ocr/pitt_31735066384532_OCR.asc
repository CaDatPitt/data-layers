Dorm Death Called Possible Suicide

By RODNEY B. GRIFFITH

Pitt News Staff Writer
Earl B. Saunders, found dead in
his Litchﬁeld .Tower C room
Thursday night, may have commit-

ted suicide, according, to prelimin- .

ary police reports.

The body, apparently dead for
two or three days, was discovered in
Room 528 by David Anthony,
resident assistant on the ﬁfth ﬂoor,
and area coordinator Ilene Schic-
witz. They entered the room after
Saunders’s girlfriend said she had
not been able to reach him for
several days.

The exact cause of death is still
being investigated by the Allegheny
County Coroner’s Ofﬁce.

“The cause of death is pending
right now, ” a spokesman said. “We
have to wait for the tests.”

City police detective Robert
McKay, who investigated the
death, said the cause will not be
known until later this week.

“The only think 1 can tell you.

right now is that he was not shot or
stabbed,” McKay said.

OUTSIDE

Sunny and mild today. Highs in
the mid 40s in the north to the up-
per 50s inthe south. Increasing
cloudiness with a chance of
showers in the west by dawn.
Lows in the low 30s to low 40s.
Cloudy with a chance of showers
tomorrow. Highs in the upper 40s
to upper 505.

Gary Siriano, a sophomore.
economics major who lives in Room:
527 Tower C, said he doubted
Saunders committed suicide.

“He took a lot of sleeping pills,
and pills to stay awake,” said
Siriano, who believes the combined
intake of those pills may have been
fatal.

Saunders graduated from Pitt in
December with a degree in
chemistry, and currently was
enrolled in engineering classes in
the School of General Studies.
Teachers and students who knew
Saunders said he was an intense
scholar.

“Most of the time, Earl was
studying more than anything else, ”
said Siriano. “A lot of people came
to him for advice on things like
chemistry or engineering. I asked
him about computer programming a
few times and he knew his material
well.” ,

Besides his girlfriend and others
who studied with him, Saunders
had few»guests, said Siriano.

“Earl was not into sports,”
Siriano said, “but he was always
friendly, asking me about track and
how I was doing.”

Siriano said Saunders became
irritable over noises. He said he
twice accompanied Saunders when
the latter complained about noise to
students on other floors.

Saunder’s former academic ad-
viser said he was both surprisedand
shocked over Saunders’s death.

“The last time I saw him he was
very cheerful,” the adviser said.
“He was wearing a suit and I
remember making a joke about the
suit.” -

“Nobody kept close tabs on
him,” Siriano said, explaining why
no one had found Saunders sooner.
“When you saw him you talked to
him, "but you didn’t usually go
looking for him. _

‘ ‘I heard his phone ringing late at
night several times,” he said. “I
was going to go over, but I saw a
towel jammed under the door. I
thought he was sleeping and I didn’t
want to bother him.”

Try ‘Out-of-the-Way’

By SUE MCFARLAND

Pitt News Staff Writer

Many students are not aware of a reduced rate parking lot
locatedat the bottom of J oncaire Street which provides parking for
Pitt students, faculty and staff, according to Pitt parking ad-

ministrator Janet Thomas.

The 150 space lot, which is rented by the University from the
Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, may be utilized after paying 60 cents
and presenting official University identification. Persons not af-
filiated with the University are charged a dollar.

The lot has been in operation since 1972 under an agreement
between the office of Student Affairs and the Pitt Parking Depart-
ment, Thomas explained.

“The lot is in a sort of an out-of—the-way location but it will be
serviced by the 84E Oakland loop shuttle bus,” Thomas added.

The 84E Oakland loop was incorporated into the Port Authority
(PAT) schedule early last December to provide additional service
linking the South Oakland residential area with the Oakland
business-healthcenter.

Pitt's Power Usage ls
Reduced by 27 Percent

By JIM MORRISON
Pitt News Staff Writer

Pitt has slightly exceeded the 25 percent mandatory power cutback
imposed by Duquesne Light Company and authorized by the Public
Utilities Commission (PUC), according to Edward Permar, manager of
energy conservation at Pitt.

Several on-campus meter readings indicate that power usage here is
down 27 percent, which “isn’t overshooting by much, ” Permar said. ‘ ‘It
almost looks like it was planned.”

“When the cutback was ordered, I believed we could achieve it with
few problems,” he said. “We’ve had good cooperation from everyone,
which makes our job at the plant services department a lot easier.”

- Permar also said the cutback would be in effect for several more weeks I
even if the coal strike were settled this week.

“Obviously this will continue until PUC lifts the regulation,”
Permar continued. “But right now I don't foresee any further
cutbacks.”

He said additional cutbacks probably won’t be necessary because
Duquesne Light seems to be meeting power demands by importing fuel
and by using more nuclear Power.

“I would be a lot less optimistic about a 50 percent cutback, ” Permar
added. “That would create some real problems.”

Permar also said he would like to see the reduction in power usage “as
an ongoing process” that would aid in meeting some long-range
conservation goals. ,_

Chancellor Posvar has set a 10 percent reduction as a long-range
target for the University. Permar said substantial progress toward that
goal has been made in the last year.

“Aside from this mandated cutback we are carrying on a logical
conservation effort which involves dozens of different ways of saving on
heating and lighting,” Permar explained.

Among conservation measures now being employed, Permar said, are
repairing windows and walls to better insulate buildings and “fixing the
big holes, like ventilators which have rusted open.”

“There is a long list of things we can do to reduce lighting and
heating. For instance, the 10:30 p.m. closing of campus buildings may
be beneﬁcial as a permanent practice in some cases.

“That doesn’t mean every building would have to be closed, or that
everyone would have to be out,” he explained. '

‘ ‘But right now one professor working late at night sometimes lights a
‘whole floor of a building because of the way the buildings are wired.
This could easily be changed by modiﬁcations in the wiring and by using
desk lamps,” Permar said.

 

Pitt power is down 27 percent, due in large part to energy conservation

measures like flicking oft unneeded lighting. Rosenthal photo

Joncaire Street Lo!‘

Funded by the City of Pittsburgh under a community develop-
ment program, the shuttle service has been operating on a six-
month trial basis. Continuation of the route after its April ex-
piration date hinges on the number of riders serviced during the six-
month time period and the financial feasibility of the entire service.

One-way fare on the loop, which runs about every 30 minutes, is
25 cents, and it is in operation Monday through Friday from 8 a.m.
to 5 p.m. inbound from Frazier and Dawson Streets and Saturday
from 8:08 a.m. to 4:38 p.m. outbound from Bouquet at Fifth.
During weekday off-hours and all day Saturday, the fare for han
dicapped passengers and senior citizens is 10 cents.

The J oncaire Street area is also serviced by the‘long-existing 84
Atwood route which is being complemented by the shuttle service
in an attempt to ease overcrowding that occurs on buses running
these neighborhood routes.

“The Band 0 Lot is something that has been around for a while
but students just didn’t know about it,” Thomas said. “The
parking problem ‘in Oakland is tremendous and this lot is con-

venient and a lot cheaper than many other l_oc_a_t_ions._’f _ _ . _ V _ ’ _ _ ; V _ _ : g

"72 Years of Collegiate Journalism at the University of Pittsburgh"

Mr. Ambassador

Andrew Young has finished his first year as United States Am-
bassador to the United Nations, and after a rocky start dotted by
outspoken statements on controversial issues, he now appears en,-
trenched in his new position. The candor displayed by Young has
built trust between him and third world nations in Africa, Asia and

Latin America.

Any man who can improve American foreign relations with the
countries in these sensitive areas is certainly the right man for the
job of United Nations Ambassador. For the last few decades, the
Vietnam debacle, the fomentation of the 1954 Guatemalan Civil
War by the CIA, the Bay of Pigs invasion and the refusal of the
United States to undertake substantive embargoes against the
present regimes in Rhodesia and South Africa have raised extreme
doubts in the third world over the United States’ willingness to
respect their sovereignty. Young promises to reverse the long trend
of poor relations created by these actions.

At this point in time, bettered relations with the third world
nations is crucial to our foreign policy. Next to the Middle East,
the area most important to American foreign policy may be Africa.
With the Soviet Union attempting to broaden its sphere of in-
fluence in the Horn of Africa through their involvement in the
Ethiopian-Somalian War, and seeking to establish a submarine
base on the Horn, the United States must build pro-Western sen-

timent in this part of Africa.

To the south of the Horn, in Rhodesia and South Africa, the
United States must build a pro-American attitude among the black
majorities who can be expected to gain power in these two nations

within the next decades.

In Latin America, the long history of

dissent against Yankee imperialism must also be stymied if the
United States wishes to build goodwill with its neighbors to the

' Young has already proven his ability to improve our relations
with third world nations in these areas where it is sorely needed.
Analysis of his first year as ambassador proves that the former civil
rights leader from Georgia is the best man for the position of U.N.
Ambassador. He deserves well—earned praise for his performance
and the continued support of the Carter Administration for a job

well done.

Davis Cup Column Hypocritical

I found the article by Mark
Murphy on “Keeping the Davis
Cup Free of Politics” hypocritical.
He asks those who are against
apartheid policy of South Africa to
keep the politics out of the Davis
Cup, but ignores the fact that it
was the South African white
minority Government which was
ﬁrst to use politics in the form of its
apartheid policy to keep potential
non-white players out of the team.
Now they ask us who are against its
apartheid policy not to use politics
in sports. They were the first who

- used politics in sports, not we. Now

once they have used politics in
sports they have no right to ask us
to keep the politics out of sports.

With regard to the right of
individual players to participate in
international tennis, nobody pro-
tests against them when they play a
as individuals in various interna-
tional tennis tournaments. It is the
government they represent that we
are protesting against, not them as
individuals.

I think the United States should

refuse to play against South Africa,
as India did in 1974, even though it
had very good chance of becoming
Davis Cup champions, which South
Africa became by default. Perhaps
it is too much to expect from the
United States,.which supported the
abortive bid to expel India from
Davis Cup, because it refused to
play against South Africa, even
when the Davis Cup championship
was at stake.

Value Freak Evaluates Carter’s Energy Bill

By GARY GOVERT

Iama value freak. Not the kind of
value freak who pours over
newspaper ads and then dashes off
to K-Mart for ten pounds of ﬁsh
food because it’s on sale, but the
kind who tends to interpret political
phenomena from a value-oriented
point of view. This policy or that
decision didn’t work, I often say,
because the values behind it were
bankrupt.

There are, of course, problems
with a value ﬁxation. Too often,
such an obsession focuses exclus-
ively on other people's values, with
little attention to one’s own. Or it
can lead the observer to overlook
much simpler s explanations for
human behavior, such as stupidity,
incompetence and illogic.

Worst of all, value ﬁxation also

tends to identify one as “some kind
of moralist or something”—a not
very nice thing to be in a culture that
prides itself on its imagined
liberality and tolerance.

But with all its disadvantages,
I’ve found value ﬁxation to‘ be a
useful and conceptually satisfying
neurosis. The pretensions of
rationalism, pragmatism and real-
ism notwithstanding, human beings
—all human beings—respond
heart, mind and soul to their values.
In fact, if our rationalists,
pragmatists and realists would only
open their eyes, they would
probably discover that their rea-

sons, their practicalities and their‘

realities are functions of their own
values.

So it is useful, as well as
interesting, to study political
phenomena in terms of the values
they reveal. Doing this, we gain the

potential to understand the seeds
from which the fruits of our
decisions spring.

But a clarification of this abstract
and metaphorical rambling is
perhaps in order. '

Not long ago, a political science
class was discussing President
Carter’s efforts to curb energy
consumption. He was unable to do
so, the students learned, because
he formulated his legislation—such
as the gasoline tax--in an inept and
politically insensitive manner.

This analysis is, Ithink, correct.
The so-called energy bill has been
dissected by Congress, and it
remains on the operating table in a
disassembled state of advanced
putrefaction. It is not likely to be
resurrected until the President is
ready to reformulate it in a fashion
more amenable to the wise and
tender sensibilities of Congress.

It occurs to me, however, that
there is more to cutting down on
energy consumption than diploma-
tically constructed, “rational” leg-
islation.

The President's energy plan
heavily emphasized conservation.
It was an emphasis I appreciated,
and one which I continue to support.
But I am not at all sure that the
values behind President Carter’s
push for conservation didn’t defeat
his effortsifrom the outset.

The Administration’s rationale
for conservation has been evident in
the rhetoric of months past.
“Energy independence,” the slo-
gan slingers plead. “Keep us free
from the threat of foreign embar-
goes; reduce our dependence on
imported oil.”

It’s the rhetoric of “national
security” and autonomy; the
rhetoric of freedom to do what we
want without interference, without
the need to answer to anyone.
Inasmuch as that rhetoric reﬂects
the values to which it appeals, some
important observations can be
made.

SIDELINES

“Even if national
security (as it is pres-
ently defined) and
economic autonomy
are legitimate and sen-
sible goals, there are
other good reasons for
energy conservation. ”

Even if national security (as it is
presently deﬁned) and economic
autonomy are legitimate and
sensible goals, there are other good
reasons for energy conservation.
The environment cries out for it.
And energy-intensive lifestyles and
economies are now seen, by some at
least, to have serious social
consequences.

But these concerns are clearly
secondary in the minds of
America's policy formulators, and, I
suppose, in the minds of their
constituents. It’s national security
and autonomy ﬁrst, the environ-
ment and the broken people of our
energy-gulping, technological soc-

iety second. We conserve for the
sake of an uninterrupted supply of
gasoline for our automobiles, not for
the sake of the land or the air or our
fellow human beings.

This is, of course, understand-
able. America has always valued its
autonomy, and we will not let it go
without a ﬁght. The ability to
function as a nation independent of
other nations is fundamental to our
self-perception. There will likely be
several collisions with a changing
and increasingly interdependent
world before our values begin to
adjust.

And it just might happen that we
will eventually begin to conserve
energy, even if for the wrong
reasons. Surely, someone might
say, this will solve those “secon-
dary” problems as well.

Perhaps, but I doubt it. I am
rather of the opinion that the two
sets of values—autonomy and
“independence” on the one hand,
concern for the environment and the
human casualties of our high-
energy culture on the other——are
diametrically opposed. The ascen-
dence of one concern is, in some
sense, the descent of the other.

All this value business is, of
course, very nebulous. Statistical
models that predict energy con-
sumption under variable circum-
stances are much neater than value
identiﬁcation and evaluation. But
my particular prejudice is that those
neat analyses are worth little
without sufﬁcient consideration of
those messy and frustrating moti-
vational factors.

In this, the value freaks ﬁnd

solace.

ROTC Fight Lingers

I heard the ROTC cadets argue
their case for military course
credits both in the CAS council and
at the FAS meeting where the
recent vote was taken. I agree with
Lt. Col. James Warren (March 8)
that their case was well-presented
and based on their strongest
arguments; namely the current
academic merit of their military
courses and the unfairness of their
paying for required ROTC credits
which in fact they do not receive.

However, I don’t see how the
ROTC instructors or the students
could still be surprised that
academic merit of the courses was
not the issue which concerned the
faculty. In 1968, 1975 and again in
1978 the issues have consistently
been the external control by the
Department of Defense and the the
conﬂict in values between the
liberal arts and the military. To
write these issues off as mere
emotionalism is to denigrate the
idea of academic freedom and to
confuse a search for universal
insights with the skillful use of
threat and force.

My agreement with Warren
ceases when he says that my
decription of military personnel as
“instruments of obedience, threat
and destruction” constitutes an
insult to the cadets. Would he have
us believe that the enlistment oath
is without meaning when it speaks

of obeying a superior ofﬁcer’s
command? Are our nuclear mis-
siles to be thought of as friendly
gestures of good will with no
destructive capabilities? One can
call upon leadership,
dence, a sense of service, technical
skill and other positive traits which
the military experience can impart.
However, at the heart of the matter
are also these purposes which
conﬂict with the purposes of human
understanding and the peaceful
resolution of conﬂicts. It is true
emotionalism to pretend that this
conﬂict of values does not exist.
To address the issue so
well-argued by the cadets: why
should the cadets pay for 12-16
credits which they don’t receive?
With modest effort, and perhaps
adding some $500 to the $2000
already given to all advanced
cadets, the ROTC can remove this
ﬁnancial injustice.
Better yet, since ROTC course
content and goals are only very
generally deﬁned, use could be
made of existing University courses
for which CAS credit will readily be
given. This removes both the extra
credit load and the unnecessary
payment of tuition. It would seem
that the cadets can most effectively
petition the ROTC to deal with their
grievance rather than continuing to
place the blame on the FAS.

Generic Products Offer Alternatives

By PATTY TASCARELLA
Pitt News Staff Writer

Oakland’s Giant Eagle is follow-
ing a widespread movement in the
supermarket chain to sell generic
products.

Generic products are packages in
plain white labels, and do not strive

for a uniformity of the products.
Therefore, the price of the generic
product is 15 to 50 percent cheaper
than the name-brand version of the
same product.

Simply speaking, the generic
brand has no frill, no fancy labels,
no brand names, but offers a low

price. The savings are brought
about by selective buying in large
quantities.

Flyers released from Giant Eagle
admit that the quality of generic
household products will be less than
the brand names’.

Concerts Keep Pittsburgh Satisfied 

B.B. King Knocks
Them Out Friday...

ByKEITH BRIAN
Pitt News Staff Writer

The Blues—B.B. King writes
them, plays them, sings them and
lives them. On Friday, his
seven-man band heated up the
Stanley Theater stage from a gentle
blues mood to a rock-tempo jam.
Then, a man, decked in a
white-on-white three-piece suit,
calmly walked onto the stage.

B.B. King had arrived.

He opened with “Blues Boy,”
caressing the strings of Lucille (his
guitar) as a similarly-clad audience
listened breathlessly.

King had charisma. He rolled
back his head, shut his eyes, gave a
grin and spoke to his audience. He
talked to them, not just a polite
statement here and there, he talked
about each tune, throwing in a few
jokes to solidify his rapport.

“How Blue Can You Get” was
the second tune of the evening, but
was the first for King to sing. With
King it’s not his voice, but the
content. His lyrics tell stories; they
work on sympathy—but more, they
work through identification. Like
King said, “When things aren’t
working out just right between two
lovers, it’s always the other
person’s fault.”

He had a solid band behind him.
His music was as strong as
anything the mind can perceive-
the whining and whimpering of
Lucille through “You’ll Learn to
Love Me or Leave Me” was enough
to prove that.

But Kaytell Walker and Walter
King on alto and tenor sax
respectively, used their woodwinds
to strong advantage throughout the
performance, seeming most dom-
inant in “Everyday I Got the
Blues,” “Midnight '-"Finds Me,
Daylight Finds Me T00” and “The
Thrill is Gone.”

The highlight of the evening was

“Nobody Loves Me But My
Mother.” The band excelled, the
audience responded lustily and

King leaned forward, opened his
eyes wide and sang “And She
Could Be Jiving Me Too.”

A close second, “All of Your

Affection Is Gone,” had the crowd‘

singing the lines before the rotund
crooner could. At one point, a
matronly black lady sang out “Sing
It To Me, hon!” He did.

“I Been Alone Along Time”
featured James Tony on electric
piano. Solo performances from Joe
Turner on bass guitar and Kala
Bentree on drums gave more
evidence of a strong musical
framework under the structure of
entertainment.

If the bass and the drums are the
superstructure, then Eddy Grove’s
trumpet is the rivets that hold the
sound together. His soft touch with
the mute during “The Thrill Is
Gone” melted the snow as it fell
that night.

This leaves Milton Hopkins with
the hardest job——backing up B.B.
on guitar. The guitarist does all the
work when King is singing-King
never plays while singing. The
guitars are the windows, they let
the light in-——whether it's bright or
it's blue. They also reﬂect back the
images of light that are on either
side of them.

The concert appearance was
waning as the entertainer sang
“Someone Really Loves You,
Guess Who,” the tempo slow and
tender as he neared the last line
“Someone really cares—-—it’s me.”

The pace turned around for the
ﬁnale—a hard, driving number
that pushed out a lot of sound
called “I Got my Mo Jo Working.”

That’s not all he had working.

...And Harry Chapin Finishes Them Off Saturday Night

By KEITH BRIAN
Pitt News Staff Writer
A chrome barstool stood at The
Stanley Theater’s centerstage with
two acoustic Epiphone guitars
positioned directly behind it. On
Saturday night, a man in blue denim
walked toward the stool, a
three-foot blond shadow following

Baltadeer Harry Chapin.

who received many ovations
throughout his periormance at the Stanley Theater

behind. The man was Harry
Ch apin, the shadow his son,
Joshua.

With the six-string in his hand,
the taller Chapin sat down and
strummed the first chord of
“Dancing Boy.” The shorter
version stood three paces to the
right, shifting his weight from left

foot to right as he tried to keep time
with the song. At the finish, the
red-headed balladeer introduced
his four-year-old offspring, then
started a conversation with the
audience that would last another
three hours.

Chapin watched as his apprentice
got back into step for “Flowers are

  

Srakocic photo

Red, Green Leaves are Green.”—
another cyclic Chapin song that tells
a story about an inept teacher who
puts metaphysical blinders on a
budding artist.

Exit Joshua in a spotlight, enter a
ﬁve-man band in the shadows.
Chapin said he had been waiting
a long time to do the show and the
audience responded the only way it
cou1d—with a roar that pushed the
back wall back five feet.

The cello painted warm tones as a
base for “Better Place To Be” while
the piano picked up the highlights
for the gentle tale of the night
watchman. At the conclusion, a
clap of thunderous applause, the
fourth of the storm, and the loudest
to that point, came and many more
followed.

Big John Wallace, the bass guitar
player, vocalized superbly through-
out the evening, starting the
presentation by playing the part of
Mr. Tanner in Chapin’s song for
music critics. The key to this saga
lies in the line “He did not know
how well he sang, it just made him
whole.” The critics in the song,
however, said how well he didn’t
sing.

Chapin ran his conversation
between every tune—joking and
explaining the chronology of his
writings and inspirations; he talked
with [hf ?:::2::<7 members like ca

finally introduced the piano player
as his brother. Steve.

A series of white spotlights

focused on the bearded man behind
the ivories as he sand a song about

“Let Time Go Lightly.” Chapin
dedicated the next number to the
band members, but they weren't
moved. Wallace asked, “How
about a raise instead?” and the lead
guitarist replied, “emotion is
cheaper.” Chapin picked out the
ﬁrst few bars and the band
members threw up their hands ant "
walked off stage, with Chapin
singing, “Alone Again, Natur-
ally”——drawing various assorted
giggles, guffaws and chortles from
the active audience. Chapin, with
his band returned, finally got
around to doing “Six-String Orche-
stra.”

After “I Want to Learn a Love
Song” and “Cat’s In The Cradle,"
they took at half-time break and
returned with Chapin telling a story

about fallen dreams in “Taxi.” At 
the end ofthe song, when “handed ,

vs

me $20 for a two-ﬁfty fare. the
audience joined in with, “Harry,
keep the change.”

The show was loose, relaxed and
very professional. The last song,
“40,000 Pounds of Bananas” had
the audience singing “bananas” in
four-part harmony.

The band returned for the
encore. “All My Life's a Circle,"
that got everyone singing. Even the
traveling crew got unaniplified.
solos. "l'he “t“lie;ip seats" got their
shot and the orchestra had a chance,
too.

Most of all, the crowd got its
money’s worth—three hours, 22
songs, and three Chapins in one

R, UNITED NATIONS (AP)-After
a year as America’s chief delegate
to the United Nations, Andrew
Young believes he has forged a
working partnership between the
United States and the Third World
and helped restore American
credibility among African nations.

His assessment is widely shared
by diplomats and veteran U.N.
hands.

Nigeria’s U.N. Ambassador,
Leslie 0. Harriman, credits Young
with being “singularly responsible
for the new bridge of understanding
that now exists between the United
States and black Africa.”

0 A Barbados delegate, who
preferred to remain anonymous,
said Young has “taken out the
element of mistrust” that, he says,
had hampered previous U.S. efforts
to improve ties with developing

countries.
And Dr. Gunter Schutze, spokes-
man for the West German

delegation, said the black American
ambassador “has fashioned a new
coalition of Western and developing
countries and enhanced America’s
prestige, there’s no doubt about it-a
far cry from the Moynihan days.”

As U.S. ambassador here two
years ago, Daniel Patrick Moynihan
was known more, for confrontation
than compromise with Third World
demands.

Aside from what the delegates
say, there are also visible signs that
the United States is mending fences
with less-developed countries.

Once a catchword in almost any
Third World speech, the phrase
“U.S. imperialism” has disappear-
ed from all but a few Communist
and hard-line Arab statements.

UN Delegates Credit Young

Young says he does not believe in
diplomacy by confrontation. “My
job is to get something done, and I
don't get easily frustrated.”

The outspoken former Georgia
congressman and civil rights leader
has stirred controversy with free-
wheeling views on sensitive issues.
But if his “verbal overkill,”, as_
Schutze puts it, has prove?
embarrassing, it also has won
plaudits from may delegates for
“candor.”

Young, who has taken personal
charge of the Carter administra-
tion’s drive for majority-rule in
southern Africa, has concentrated
on building trust for the West and
identifying common ground with
Third World nations, especially the
Africans, in an effort to enlist their
Support for Western initiatives.

Pitt’s 134-pound wrestler Rande
Stottlemyer won all-America honors
at the NCAA Championship Tour-
nament at College Park, Md.,last
weekend, pacing his team to a
20th-place ﬁnish.

Stottlemyer placed ﬁfth despite a
severely sprained ankle that
hobbled him in the Eastern
Wrestling League (EWL) qualifying
tournament two weeks ago.

“Under the circumstances, with
the sore ankle, I’ll take the ﬁfth
place,” Stottlemyer said. “But
earlier in the season, the last thing
in the world I would have wanted
was to place sixth again.”

Stottlemyer placed sixth three
years ago—his sophomore year-
and won two previous all-America
titles by placing sixth until his
serious injury in a dual match
against Ohio State this season put
his ability to even qualify in
question.

“I think he could have won the
championship if it wasn’t for his
-ankle,” Panther head coach Dave
Adams said. “He was pretty well
beat up by his third match.”

Stottlemyer decisioned fifth-
seeded Mike Mathies of Portland
State, 11-7, and Dave Blake of
Arizona, 12-7, before losing to
fourth-seeded Fran Affentranger of
Cal St.-Bakersﬁeld, 11-4.

“My ankle wasgiving me a lot of
trouble then,” Stottlemyer said.
“After my ﬁrst match, I began
favoring it—but I just did the best
with what I had.”

Stottlemyer was put in the

The semiﬁnals will be played
Saturday in St. Louis with
top-ranked Kentucky, 28-2, facing
No. 5 Arkansas, 31-3, and No. 7
Duke, 26-6, going against No. 6
Notre Dame, 23-6. The ﬁnals will be
played Monday night.

Seventh-ranked Duke piled up a
21-point lead in the ﬁrst half as the
Blue Devils’ hustling zone defense
forced Villanova turnovers and the
6-foot-11 Gminski dominated the
defensive boards.

Villanova was cold for the ﬁrst 13

consolation bracket where he
decisioned Virginia’s Steve Silver-
berg (5-3 in overtime) and
Nevada-Las Vegas's Tyrone Rose
(5-1) before dropping his ﬁnal bout
to Franklin & Marshall’s Brian
Brown, 9-2.

Meanwhile, Pitt’s 190-pounder
Bill Bailey won his ﬁrst three
matches to put the Panthers into the
national rankings.

Bailey decisioned Kent State’s
Pete Houghtaling (11-4), Mar-
shall’s Jeremiah Gaglon (8-5) and
Eastern Illinois’s Robin Ayers
(12-9) before falling to defending
champion Frank Santata of Iowa

Bailey beat Florida’s Brian
Gaffney, 7-2, in the Consolation
round, but lost to ﬁfth-seeded
Howard Harris of Oregon State,

received all-American status.

“Bi1l’s knees were really bother-
ing him,” Adams said. “He had
trouble moving around.”

Three other Panthers were
eliminated quickly: 118-pound
freshman Glenn Maxwell lost his
opening-round match to Okla-
homa’s Brian Evans, 9-5; 126-
pounder Jose Martinez decisioned
Northern Illinois’s Lonnie Parker,

20-foot jumpers over the zone.

Herron led Villanova with 20
points and Robinson had 16.
Freshman forward Eugene Banks
added 17 for Duke.

Freshman forward Kenny Den-
nard sparked the Blue Devils in the
second half with 12 points to help
hold off the desperate Wildcats.

Herron was limited to eight
points in the ﬁrst half, with four of
them coming in the last 40 seconds.

Final Four Caliber Teams Share Certain Characteristics

And now, there are but four.
When the NCAA tournament began nine days ago,

i“""2 teams boarded the merry-go-round in quest of the

brass ring that signifies the national championship.
Miami of Ohio let the nation know that the Davids
wouldn’t be rolling over for the Goliaths when the
Redskins dethroned defending national champion
Marquette in the tournament’s first game. ,

Six more upsets followed, and what remained were
four teams that are accustomed to watching the
NCAA‘ semifinals and finals in a seat whose major
advantage is its proximity to a refrigerator (with the
exception of Kentucky).

College basketball is in the midst of a major coup

®d’etat; no further verification of that statement is
ikneeded after one realizes that UCLA has not been

able to survive its regional the past two years. The
talented teams still will win most games, but not
necessarily in post-season play. The teams that have
survived the NCAA’s annual version of a battle royal
seem to have some things in common.

Teams that depend on a large percentage of its
points from one player have trouble against teams
with a balanced offensive attack. Translation:
Freeman _Williams and Larry Bird may be enter-
taining to the fans, but they will never wear a
national championship ring. No players that will
make an appearance in St. Louis carry a scoring

 V average of better than 21 points a game.

The days of dependence on one man to carry the
team’s banner into the rebounding battlepalso seems
to have gone by the boards. Rebounding has evolved
into a team effort rather than an exhibition by the

tallest giraffe on the court. Neither Arkansas, Duke
nor Notre Dame depends on its center for the
majority of rebounds, and Kentucky’s board
strength lies in the triumverate of Rick Robey, Mike
Phillips and James Lee.

Making a large percentage of one’s field goal at-

 

national championship express not to develop trans-
mission trouble. All four teams finished in the top
15 in the country in team field goal percentage, and
three of them (Arkansas, first; Kentucky, third, and
Duke, eighth) finished in the top 10. One of the keys
to victory, as Al McGuire has said, is simply “to put
the ball in the hold.”

Games between teams of relatively equal talent are
often decided at the free throw line, and three of the
select four (Duke, Kentucky and Arkansas) finished
in the top 15 in team percentage from the charity
stripe. A team’s performance from the line is also
directly proportional to the poise factor. If a player
can keep his throat from swelling as he stands at the
free throw line with the game in the balance, he also
is likely to retain his ability to swallow when faced

, with other critical situations.

An ability to score, both from the field and the free
throw line, reflects on a team’s winning percentage,
as Kentucky and Arkansas each won better than 90
percent of the time this season. Duke and Notre
Dame could be absolved of seemingly “poor” win-

ning percentages because of the type of schedule they -

play.

Defense, which has come to dominate football, is
important, but not essential, to success in the tour-
nament. Arkansas is the only team in St. Louis to
excel] in the defensive art, allowing a paltry 61.5
points per game (fourth in the nation). If, however,
a team can avoid turnovers and make a high percen-
tage of its shots, defense often becomes an exercise in
futility. The ability to play tough defense is undoub-
tedly an asset, but few, if any, national champion-
ships are won with an emphasis on defense.

Naturally, there are intangibles involved in sur-
viving five games in less than 17 days against many of
the nation’s ﬁnest practioners of roundball. The
coach, officiating and the draw are all important
ingredients, but are rarely justiﬁable excuses for
being eliminated.

The officials are not assigned games that have -

teams from their districts, so that games never
degenerate to one official calling the game from one
bias and the other referee balancing his partner’s
calls at every opportunity.

The odyssey to St. Louis is accomplished by those
teams that score many points on few shots, keep its
poise when victory is in the balance and play the
game as a team. And, as grade school basketball
coaches preach, “there is no ‘I’ in the word ‘team.’ ”

Tennin Holds No Fears of NCAA Swim Foes  I

By KAREN KADILAK
Pitt News Staff Writer

With one of the biggest swim
meets in his career less than a week
away, you’d expect Pitt freshman
Mickey Termin to be a little
nervous. He isn’t.

“It will be a new experience for
me, but I don’t really think that I’m
that nervous about it,” Termin said
about next week’s NCAA cham-
pionships. “If I am nervous, it’s
from being worried about how I’m
going to swim and the size of the
meet. I’m not going to be worried

a about any individual swimmer. ’ ’

The freshman from Dauphin,
Pa., will swim in three relays—400-
yard freestyle, 400-yard medley
and 800-yard freestyle. He, Stu
Swanson and Jeff Trew will be the
only Panther freshmen to make the
trip to Long Beach_,,,Calif., where
the meet starts Thursday and
continues through Saturday.

Although he will be competing in
his ﬁrst NCAA championship,
Termin doesn’t feel he will be any
less experienced than any of the
other swimmers.

“It’s going to be a new thing for
me, but it’s not like I’ve never been

in a big meet before,” Termin
explained. “l’ve competed with a
lot of good swimmers. In fact, one
of them (UCLA’s Gene Bartle) is
swimming in the NCAA’s, too.
Bartle has won three gold medals
in the World Games and ﬁnished
fourth in the olympic trials.

“He would have made the
Olympic Games, but he came down
with mononucleosis right before
the trials,” Termin continued.
“He’ll be swimming at Long
Beach, and a couple other good
swimmer I know will be swimming
out there, too.”

Termin went on to explain that if
anything, and fact that Trew,
Swanson and he are the only
freshmen competing for coach Dick
Bradshaw’s Panthers is bound to
help.

“Jeff said something to the
affect last week that we really don’t
have anything to lose since we’re
freshmen,” Trew said. “I agree
with him. If we don’t do well, it
really won’t matter because people
aren’t expecting that much from
us. If we do well, we’re heroes.

“Don’t get me wrong,” Termin
continued. “We’re going to give it
our best shot. We just don’t have
as much to lose like the older.
swimmer do.”

Termin and junior Mark Schu-
man will be the only Panthers to
swim in three relays. As it often
happens, Termin had to beat out
one of his teammates at the recent
Eastern Regional Championships
to earn the honor.

“Going into the Easterns, the
coaches didn’t know who would
swim in the 400-yard medley relay
at the NCCA’s,” Termin explain-
ed. “Dave (Civis) and I both had
swum the anchor in the relay. So it
came down to a decision between
the two of us.

“On the ﬁrst day, I had to swim
in the 500-yard freestyle in both the
preliminaries and the ﬁnals,” he
continued. “That's 20 laps right
there. With the 400—yard medley
coming up right after that, the
coaches thought it would be better
to let Dave swim the anchor.
They’d though I’d be a little tired
after doing so much swimming in
the 500 free.

“Since our times were so
similar,” Termin said, “the
coaches then decided that the best
way to determine who was going to
swim in the relay at the NCAA’s
was to take the guy who had the
fastest time in the 100-yard
freestyle (the length of the anchor
leg.) I beat Dave time-wise in that
event, so I get to swim in the
NCAA’s.”

Termin said there was some
friendly competition between Civis
and him to decide who was going to
swim in the relay. _

“You better believe Dave and I
wanted to swim in the medley,”
Termin said, “But if Dave had
beaten me out, I wouldn’t have had
any hard feelings. Rules are set
down for that purpose. The
coaches made a rule at the
Easterns that whoever got the best
time in the 100 free would get the
opportunity to swim in the medley.
It happened that I won.”

Civis, one of two seniors on the
squad, will compete in both the
400-and 800-yard freestyle relay
teams. Besides Termin, Civis,
Swanson (400-yard medley) and
Trew (800-yard freestyle), the other
Panthers competing in the relays,/
include junior Bob Greenwald
(400-yard freestyle) and senior
Orlando Cantinchi (400-yard med-
ley).

Termin narrowly missed qualify-
ing in an individual event at
Easterns.

“It would have been good to
qualify in an individual event,”
Termin said. “But I’m not going to
worry about it; all I want to do is do
well in the relays.”

Duke, Irish Advance

“We put everything together,”
said Duke Coach Bill Foster. “They
missed some shots early and we
were rebounding with a vengeance.
We had four hands on the ball
sometimes.”

Duke outrebounded Villanova
40-30 and threw up a hustling zone
defense that forced frequent
turnovers and stymied the Wild-
cats’ shooting. The Blue Devils
built the lead to double ﬁgures in
the first ﬁve minutes and never
looked back. ‘

“We don’t get behind too often
and make a big game of it,” said
Villanova Coach Rollie Massimino.
“Everything Duke shot went in.
We had to play catch-up.”

Duke hit 65 percent of its shots
from the ﬁeld to 42 percent for
Villanova.

Notre Dame, which lost at home
to DePaul in overtime during the
regular season, trailed by as many
as 8 points in the ﬁrst halfbut pulled

ahead 37-33 at the break. ,-
Tripucka’s 20-footer gave Notre
Dame the lead for good at 47-46 with
11:48 remaining and ignited a 22-8
Notre Dame streak that Bill
Laimbeer capped with a 10-foot shot
from the lane to put the Irish on top
67-54.

DePaul center Dave Corzine, who
had 46 points in the Blue Demons’
90-89 double overtime victory over
Louisville in the regional semiﬁnal,
played despite a dislocated ﬁnger
and managed 17 points.

Bruce Flowers and Rich Branning
added 15 points each for Notre,
Dame, Don Williams had 14 a,

Laimbeer 12. " 

It will be Notre Dame’s ﬁrst trip
ever to ‘the ﬁnal four, and coach
Digger Phelps says that whatever
happens, “The rest is gravy.”

“To make it to the ﬁnal four isjust
unbelievable. All we’ve been living
for is this moment.”
