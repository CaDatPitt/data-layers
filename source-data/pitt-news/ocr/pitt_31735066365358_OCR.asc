Magazine Format Planned

‘Free Press’ Approved

by POHLA SMITH
News Editor

A new publication has been giv-
en official go-ahead for its plan
to present articles to students in
an analytical, magazine-style
format.

The University of Pittsburgh
Free Press has been recognized
by the Student Publications Board
as a student publication and by
the Committee on Student Organ-
izations and the Social Commis-
sion as a student organization.

Bob Ging. editor, said that the
publication, which will be pub-
lished bi-monthly . in magazine
style, will contain analysis of ma-
jor news stories, entertainment,
and features of interest to stu-
dents. “

Many faculty members and stu-
dents have already expressed in-
terest in writing for the publica-
tion, according to Ging. “We have
already obtained a drama critic
and a music critic,” he said.

But the big question in the
minds of many is whether or not
the paper will try to compete with
the Pitt News. Ging insists it will
not.

“We couldn‘t compete with the
Pitt News,” he said. “It would be
impossible to compete with a pub-
lication that publishes six times
as frequently as ours.

“Our purpose is basically other
than the Pitt News.”i

The difference, he said, is that
the Free Press staff will not be
working under the pressures of
three deadlines weekly as Pitt
News staffers do.

Because they have two weeks to
prepare ‘for an issue, Ging said
they will be able to go into more
depth and detail. Also, he hopes
they will be choosy and print only
the better articles contributed.

The seeds. of the Free Press
were sown last March when staff-
ers of Ideas and Figures (the lit-
erary magazine) decided there
was a need for a free press.

While working on plans for it
this summer the staff members
decidedit would be better for the
Free Press to be autonomous
rather than a part of Ideas and
Figures, Ging said.

The groups’ charter and pers-

'pectus were reviewed Oct. 1 by

the Publications Board, a group
of students, faculty members and
professional journalists that sets
standards for Pitt student, pub-
lications.

—-Eleanor Walsh. Student Publi-
cations director, said the Board
reviewed the proposed charter
and then questioned Free Press
representatives about their goals.

“We dwelled on whether or not
it would be a-free press or actual-
ly a mouthpiece for a few stu-
dents." she said. "They assured
us they would try to get opinions
from the entire University."

Walsh said the Free Press was
approved because the Board does
encourage experimental type pub-
lications as long as they abide by
their charters and student publi-
cations policies.

“We thought itwould be bene-
ficial," Walsh commented.

The group went through a simi-
lar procedure with the Committee
on Student Organizations and the
Social Commission to gain recog-
nition. -

Now they are.awaiting llvord on
their request for funds from the
SA Allocations Committee. Ging
said they hope the committee will
consider their request this week.

He said he thinks the Free Press
will also receive moneyfrom the
General Studies Cabinet;_ they
hope to sell subscriptions to the
University for additional funds,
as the Pitt News does . ‘

Meanwhile, Gings says they will
set up in the Polaris office. as
there is no available office space.
He hopes to have the first issue
out by the end of the month.

38 Complaints
Filed in OCHO

by RON LOZOWSKI
Feature Editor

Student tenants and landlords
filed a total of 38 complaints with
the‘ Off—Campus Housing Office
last month, according to Ron Cow-
ell, director of the office.

_ This figure includes only those
instances when a formal com-
plaint was filed; anonymous re-

ports were left out of the total.

Cowell said that the majority of
complaints were quickly handled
by OCHO. .

Cowell said that according to
the records. only two complaints
were of discrimination. In one in-
stance, a student complained that
the rental office was refusing to
return his calls—simply because
he was a student. Cowell noted
that this problem "was not really a
serious one. ‘

°Tigl1tWa(l’, °Buil(ler’
, ClashOVe1' Skybus

by VICKI TUTIN '

Allegheny County Commission-
ers Leonard Staisey and William
Hunt clashed here over the Sky-
bus in a debate that ended in ver-
bal pandemonium.

Before an audience of about 50

students, Hunt (R) discussed the -

main issues of the campaign.
Speaking mostly on rapid transit,
he stated that the critical issue
was not Skybus, but rather wheth-
er or ‘not "the taxpayers (have)
lost control over County govern-
ment" to the “power of the spe-
cial interest groups."

The “Tightwad” lamented what
he labeled the waste of money in
County government. He stated
that the party-in power is so “obli-
gated to certain interest groups
(that) they can no longer properly
function in County government.
Now is the time to correct a two
year old decisioiL(Skybus) and get
back on the right track,” Hunt
said. — .

The Skybus. a mass transit sys-
tem to link downtown Pittsburgh
with the South Hills. has won the
approval of the county and fed-
eral government. but is currently
being blocked by Mayor Peter
Flaherty. Skybus has been criti-
cized by Hunt who prefers a steel
wheel-steel rail proposal. Com-

 

 .

missioners Staisey and Thomas‘

Foerster support Skybus.

Staisey (D.) summarized his
slogan and that of his running-
mate. Foerster, the “Builders,”

as follows: "You have to build in -

order for this county to grow . . .
to be relevant to the rest of the
country." He said that it is "the
failure to make decisions, the pre-
disposition to examine and reex-
amine" which has retarded the
growth of County government;
"the County won’t rise or fall with
a decision on Skybus . . . it may
rise or fall on indecision."

Staisey compared the alterna-
tives a “No-No” government,
housed in the courts and stopping
there, or his “Go-Go” govern-
ment, embodied in the people.

Many of the 'questions that fuel-
ed the often-bitter debate also
dealt with the Skybus. In response
to a question concerning the Sky-
bus, Hunt questioned the unknown
cost and technology of the project.
Staisey, in turn. charged that
Hunt. "represents the timidity,
fear. and mistrust of the previous
generation,” whereas he, Staisey,
represents the progressive “now.“

The Commissioners seemed to

possess contradictory information
on the Skybus. In response to a

A ‘Photo by ._llVes‘Iey Yang"

In the one instance where racial
discrimination was claimed, a

student allegedly attempted’ to '  7!‘;

rent an apartment and was told

that the vacancy had been filled._._ ~ 
When the OCHO investigated,‘it’ 
verified that the landlord was tell-  ' 

ing the truth.

 

However, Cowell said. that sa‘,
_more serious problem may _exist.rg_
“In a way, I'm kind of disappoint- . 1

ed that we received so few com-
plaints of this nature,"

ell.‘ .

Four complaints claimed viola-fl,’  

tions of the health orbuildihg

codes. In these instances, said;
Cowell, the landlords were re-“ :
ported to the health department ' '

or building inspectors.
There were a dozen reports

from students disagreeing with ,- ..

their landlords over the return of

their security deposits. The stu- 
either were dissatisfied 
with the amount refunded or had» ’

dents

not yet been notified of the

charges. In the latter instance,-— -

students were informed, that the
law required they be notified
within 30 days. When students
were returned less than had been

expected, the landlords were con- . . * '

sulted.

There were" eight complaints’

that the landlord failed to fulfill
either the lease or verbal agree-
ments—for example, he may have
promised to paint the apartment
yet failed to do so.

There were also two cases when

sublessors caused damage and the
original tenants were held re-
sponsible and eight- violations of
the rent freeze. In only one in-
stance was a complaint filed by a
landlord rather than‘a tenant.

Cowell expressed general sat- _ C’

complaints were valid and most

lLess Fad, More ‘Habit

Associate Editor

, A kid wearing a black and
gold Pirate cap flopping over
"his ears runs into Gus Miller‘s.
-.,_ Peering out from his‘ hat, he sus-
g piciously eyes the toy displays,
until hespots the yo—yos. “There
they are daddy," he shouts to
I his sister and father who have
followed him into the store," I
 wanna Duncan Butterfly.” "The
3.kids jump excitedly, scream-
ing colors and models at the
 amused clerk. Wearily, daddy
 1 tells the clerk “we want two yel-
low Duncan Butterflies."

The clerk smilingly trades
the two yo-yos for $2.12-it is an

  

  

Theories of the origin of
the yo-yo and its name vary.
According to some, Philip-

. pino hunters used yo-yos
thousands of years ago to kill
small game. Others say the
name. “yo-yo” was inspired
ploy a Phillipino dialect phrase
meaning “come back.”

Still another has it that
Donald Duncan, who intro-
duced the toy to America in
I928, gained inspiration for
the name from the greeting

--1. “yoo hoo.”

In any case, the name “yo-
yo” soon meant something
else to Duncan-money. The
toys caught the public fancy
and made Duncan a million-
aire. In the 30's, he bought
the rights to the parking
meter and at one time manu-
factured 80% of the world's
supply.

Duncan died of a stroke

' last May I5 at the age of 71 .

 

 

exchange he has made many
times of late. After years of
dust-gathering in warehouses,
the yo-yo has again s‘pun its way
into the hearts and hands of the
city’s children.

A toy buyer for the G.C. Mur-
phy Co. reports that his store's
yo-yo sales are "tremendous."
An employee of the F.W. Wool-
worth Co., shopping at the firm’s

!McKeesport store for a yo-yo

for her son. was amazed to find
none left. "I thought the yo-yo
was dead," she marvelled.

On campus, yo-yo sales have
been equally phenomenal.
The University Pharmacy, which
never before stocked the toys,
sells several_dozen a week. In
the past three weeks, Gus Mill-
er’s has ordered and sold six
shipments of Duncan yo-yos.

The resurgence of the yo-yo
in Pittsburgh was sparked by a
massive advertising campaign
by Flambeau Plastics of Bar-
aboo. Wisconsin. The firm, which
packages 12 yo-yo demonstrators
and television spots for cities ac-
ross the nation, launched its
hard-sell in the Pittsburgh area
at the beginning of September.

Now, T.V. commercials plug-

ging yo-yos dot the Saturday.

morning kiddie programming.
Sunday, yo-yo expert Gus Som-
era appeared on Paul Shannon's
Adventure Time, advising "aspir-
ing yo-yoers on the intr.icacies
of “Rock the Cradle," "Around
the World." and other yo-yo
tricks.

KEEPING IT GOOD

The .woman at Woolworth’s
has every right to be confused.
The yo - yo indeed appeared
“dead” when, in 1965, th‘e Dun-
can firm went out of business.

Strings Pulled Ifor Yo-yo’s Retii1'n

 

Youngster Duncan

twirling a
“Butterfly.”
Duncan had more "or less mono-
polized the business, even copy-
righting the name yo - yo,”
(competing firms were forced to

call ‘their toys “Cheerios,” or
other less appealing names), "and
when Duncan folded, interest in

the yo:-yo «seemed strung out.

Flambeau purchased the Dun-
can name, company, and proces-
ses four years ago. Since that
time, with the aid of carefully
planned promotions, Flambeau
has sold roughly 20 million yo-
yos. I

But the Duncan monopoly, has
given way to more spirited com-
petition. The best-seller‘ at the
University Pharmacy is the “Fes-
tival" — yo-yos shaped like var-_
ious sports gear, produced by
the Union Wadding Co. of Paw-
tucket, R.I. Yo-yo buyers at Mur-
phy‘s prefer a 39-cent beginners
model made by a North Carolina
firm. At Gus Mi1ler‘s, Duncan
models are still tops.

Most merchants feel the yo-
yo’s heightened popularity will
wind down as does Flambeau’s
ad campaign. “We feel that it
will not be the same as it was
when it came out in the 30’s,”
predicted one.

But by covering the nation with
orchestrated promotion
tours, Flambeau hopes to make
the yo-yo less of a fad and more
of a habit. .

“We hope that what were do-
ing." said a Flambeau official,
"will keep it good."

Bird Exhorts Womeita

Night Editor

Caroline Bird was a feminist
before Women’s Liberation be-
came a house-hold phrase. Last.
Thursday she came to Pitt to
talk about her five years in the
women‘s movement and how she
initially came to the conclusion
that women are indeed discri-
minated against.

Five years ago, Caroline Bird
was asked by the Saturday Even-
ing Post to writeabout women in
American -society. She explained
that she traveled to -a number of
large cities and talked to many.

women in high-ranking positions -

in what were considered to be
male occupations.

What Bird found was
women in high-ranking positions
considered themselves better than
the average woman. As Betty
Friedan put it, these high-rank-
ing women thought there was
three sexes, “men, women and

19

me.

Caroline ‘Bird’s article, dealing
mainly with the plight of the
average woman was rejected. As
she explained, “The article
was filled with more indigna-
tion than grace.”

Because she still wanted toget
her ideas to the public, Bird’ was
forced to write one of the first
feminist books, Born Female.
She added happily that she must
have been on the right path be-
cause “The Saturday Evening
Post went, out of business and
Born Female is still going strong
in its second edition.”

“Women’s Lib has come a long
way since 1968,” Bird asserted.
In ‘68, the first major feminist
protest took place at the Miss
America Contest in Atlantic city.

. But will the movement last?

Caroline Bird believes it will.
She stated that women are no
longer as dependent on men for
support as she put it, “The old
view was that marriage meant
sex for him and support her. Now
the man doesn’t have‘ to married
to have sex and the woman doesn’t

have to marry for economic sup-
port.”

Another reason the movement
may last is that there are sub-
stantial changes being made in
family structure. Bird stated that
“relationships between ' men
and women are ruled by power.
Many women are demanding
that the power be more evenly‘
distributed." Once changes in
something as basic as the family
are established, said Bird, they
are almost as hard to reverse as
they were to affect. .

Bird also asserted that mar-
riage is becoming a personal
choice. But she added that there
are still a number of changes
that must occur before marriage
becomes a complete matter of
choice. “Places must be found in
business, education, and poli-
tics," Bird stated, “to provide
women with viable alternatives
to marriage, so that if you de-
cide to stay home, it is what you
really want. "

Bird stated that she has great
hope for the under-25 age group
because they may affect many of
the changes needed for equity
between the" sexes. Bird stated
that the greatest advantage that
young women have is that “they
are really different.”

In closing, Bird urged her 40
listeners to “Shoot for the job
you want and ask for it. You
may find that you’re pushing on
an open door."

tober, $10,684 in,November, $8,364 in
January, $8,846 in February, and $9,976

A “These are the amounts that Student
sociation Social Commissioner Leon-
 Klavonic had planned to lose, on
each of his bigtime productions of the
month. This represents a sum of $63,-
794 being flushed down the old public
convenience.

I ‘But even the best organized deficits
sometimes go astray. So far this year
Lennie is squandering more student
cash than even he anticipated. ‘

1 Before further discussion, let me ex-
plain 'my old-fashioned notion of eco-
iiomics. To calculate profit or loss on
an event, one subtracts the box-office
receipts from the total cost of the ev-
ent. If the remainder is plus, there is
profit, if minus, loss.

6 Applying this criteria to Klavonic’s
own _figures for the Blood, Sweat and
" Tears extravaganza, we find an overall
"cost of $23,049.14, 3 minus. Simple sub-
‘-traction of the total ticket sales of $10,-
¥_273 indicates a financial bath to the
"2 tune of $12,776.14.

We will now see how rapidly Len-
-‘inie had to shuffle the shells in order to
educe this. First there was the origin-
,al.,;subsidy,; or built-in September loss
_fj$10,601. In addition, $1,500 was cut
“from the Homecoming budget to help
lubsidize the BS&T concert.

 This still leaves $675.14 lost, but
what the hell is that, anyone can drop
hat much.

’ Says Bob Lederman, operations dir-
ye tor for this fiasco, “The loss of $675.14
“was ‘considerably less than our origin-
‘Tally estimated loss of between $2500 and
6500. I’m pretty happy, though, that

Under the provisions for Phase
_'II.of the plan, a 15 member board

business, labor, and the public

V According to Cowell, the rules
regarding rent increases will be
: muchless cut and dried compared
to Phase I. Residents will be hes-
,itant to file complaints and land-
lords will find it easier to talk
around certain problems.

"Therefore, it will be easier to

our error in judgment was_in a positive

rather than a negative direction.

Your loss, Bob, or, more precisely.
the loss to the students of this Univer-
sity, was $12,776.14. .How much would
you have to lose before you would call
it “negative"?

Not only do these people waste our
money, but they hold us in such con-
tempt, they feel that they can juggle
the figures on the front page of the
Pitt News with impunity.

Behind the scenes finagaling is
easier. Let us examine Klavonic’s
complete spending picture. The Alloca-
tions Committee awarded him $71,746,
plus the additional $1500 from Home-
coming, which makes it $73,246.00.

$63,794 plus the additional $1500 sub-
sidy equals $65,294 going down for defi-
cits. Subtracting this figure from the
total budget of $73,246 leaves a mere
$7,952 for “free” entertainment. In oth-

er words, Lennie spends 89% of his bud— '

get to underwrite the bigtime concerts
for which students must pay an addi-
tional $3 & $4 to attend.

You will now perhaps understand '
my sense of wonder last Thursday night b

when I heard Lennie tell a combined
meeting of the Social Commission and
Allocations Committee, crowded into
the back room of the Student Associa-
tion suite, why a review of the $6400
Franklin Pangborn Film Club budget
(that’s right, $6400, half of what Lennie
loses in one night) was necessary.

,“More and more students,” he said,
“are complaining about the increase in
the activities fee and wanting to know

why they must pay extra at the door '

for everything.” I. thought that, ‘the
sheer weight of such hypocrisy would
evoke uncontrollable laughter

nie himself to break up.

I was wrong, of course. ‘They took I
him almost as seriously as he took him- 3

self. ~

When I attempted to suggest the1'
possible cause of these exorbitant fees, .

Arnie Steinberg and Larry Shaffer joint-

I am writing this letter on behalf of all the stu— ‘
dents in the School of Nursing. There are a few com-
ments and corrections we would like to set you
straight on in regard to Rudy Potenzone’s state-
ments in the Oct. 4 Pitt News, page two.

First of all, who is the “we” to whomnursing
students have taken their gripes? (“We have re-
ceived numerous gripes from nurses on their
courses”) Are you referring to the Undergraduate
Academic Review Committee? If so, I can’t imag-
ine why students would take complaints to you and
not their student representatives. _

If nursing students have gripes, they tell their
class representatives who then take action. These
representatives take the complaints to the Nursing
Student Organization Student Council, and/o'r the
instructor or department coordinator directly.

Secondly, the School of Nursing does not refuse to
evaluate its courses. Each course has its own eval-
uation system, all of which are basically the same.

At the end of each term we fill out an evaluation
form, and in some cla_sses this is also done at mid-
term.

Aside from specific questions about the course,
we are free to express any opinions, changes. cri-
ticisms, etc. of the course and/or instructor. Some-
times changes cannot be made immediately in the
middle of the term but changes are made for the
next class.

What you fail to understand is that the School of
Nursing has had its own evaluation system for
years. Evaluation is already a part of this school
for the‘ students’ benefit.

You also fail to understand that our curriculum
is already in a block schedule form for our students.
We don‘t have a choice as to whom we want as an
instructor for a particular course because the Nurs-
ing Schools are not set up tha‘t way.

wrong to grant funds to many small
groups when he had other ideas, a grand

design which would benefit the entire“

student body.

of his lawful share of the swag.

He told me himself that he paid a
call on’ the then Vice—Chancellor for
Finance Edison Montgomery and sug-
gested that the University terminate its

Board, arguing that students should have

the students. ‘

Chairman of the Social Commission.
the last word on all student programs.

Meanwhile, back in the Student
Union, some students, but even more
members of the Student Affairs staff,
began to worry aloud about the sudden
abandonment of small organizations,

especially in mid-summer while most-

of them were away.

Everybody sat down and reached a
"compromise", a" raise in the activities
fee to $12 per term. This gave Lennie,
Denny, and Wade enough to satisfy-
even them, and still leave enough for
the small fish.

The Commissioners submitted bud-
gets. The Allocatioiis Committee cut
them. “You can‘t do: that," said the
Commissioners."'Car1’t we?" asked Al-
locations until they ‘discovered that they
could indeed. Charges. Countercharg-
es. Impasse. Enter then Vice-Chan’cell-
or-for Student Affairs Bernard J. Kob-
osky to declare that unless there was a
proper mechanism for distributing stu-
dent funds,'the University would not col-
lect them. Only too well aware that no
student in his right mind would give
them money unless forced to, the Com-
missioners settled down temporarily
and pursued, the pleasures of spend-
ing. .

Now that we know how badly Len-
nie wants us _to have concerts and what
bounds he has exceeded -in bringing
them to us, it is time to ask Do We
Need Them? The concerts or the com-
missioners? A

-Nursing not above Reproof, Just Different   The Pitt News

Editor:

 

cooperated with your system of evaluation and the
School of Nursing has not. This fall, our Student
Council did discuss this matter and it was unani-
mously decided not to participate. The Council’s de-
cision was because: ‘

—~ We already have our own evaluation system.

— We feel that publishingiithe results of our evalua-
‘ tions would be meaningless to the rest of the Uni-

versity students because not take N-urs— '

ing courses.

— We feel participation in your academic review

lfwould only be a repetition of a system we already
ave. '

My last comment is in regard to your statement
that the Nursing School is “above criticism.” Our
students, especially our senior class, the first to go
through a new curriculum, can bear this out. The
students are making known their concerns, criti-
cisms, etc. directly to the faculty and administra-
tion so changes can be made. i

In addition, our Student Council is in the process
of reviewing student applications for representation
on faculty committees. These students will be in-
volved directly with helping to plan courses by of-
fering suggestions and letting the faculty know the
students’ view before faculty decisions are made.

Likewise, students will then know more about
the faculty’s viewpoint and purpose in planning.
Nursing students are not only involved in evalua-

tion but are becoming a more integral part in plan-
ning. too.

We are very aware of the needs of the students
and realize this system of education is not perfect.
but we are making more advances toward construc-
tive changes.

In an article on elevator
breakdowns (Pitt News, Oct. 4)
was an announcement that an ori-
entation will be held to familarize

‘campus police and maintenance
with the operation of the elevators
especially during emergencies.
‘The orientation will also be used
to help improve communication
between Housing and Campus Po-
lice, something which-I feel. af-
ter.°doing the story. is long over-
due. 3 1

Donovan Hughes. one of three
assistants to thedirector of Hous-
ing admitted that when a student
is on crutches or confined to a
wheelchair temporarily and giv-
en an elevator key. no one checks
to see if he has recuperated. _

The student, after recovering,
may temporarily be out of a five
dollar depost but gains possible

- "personal“ elevator car at the ex-
pense of some students whom po-
lice are unableto help untilthey
either find where the ‘joyrider
.' parked the car or get to the victim
- using the_steps. ,

Hughes did say that from now
on, someone will be checking tem-
porarily handicapped students .
with keys. But why wasn’t it done
before? -

A campus police officer in the
story said that the call key to the
center elevator of Tower B was
‘broken and for an emergency the
police would have contact the-
main desk to bring it down.

It turns out that in emergency
, situations campus police are sup- ’
‘posed to contact the main desk in
the Towers. lobby which takes
control of the elevator, not the
police.-

‘CL°lawn Siipplements Mental Exercise

After the story appeared, I ask-
ed Hughes if he found any errors
in it. He said he didn't. Ithink that
a man in‘ his position should be

aware of emergency procedures
among police.

1

And why has it taken so long to
get around to training police per-
sonnel how to respond to emer-
gencies? _

Obviously. the officer was mis-
taken and so was Hughes. Could
Hughes,-indifference be indicative
of the Housing Office attitude to_-
ward students also?

Another aspect of the story‘ that
seemed strange to me was the re-
fusal of maintenance and campus
police to be identified-, supposedly
out of fear of -being misquoted or
misinterpreted. But I hope that

lem also.

just plain selfishness? A

In defense of Mr. Collageto, I concede that font-
ball, baseball, soccer, and other lawn sports take
their toll on grass. However, doesn’t he really feel‘
that the Pitt signs were really directed at those in-
dividuals who are too lazy to walk ‘an additional 100
feet? My opinion of those people using lawns as
shortcuts is very low.

However. I am pleased to see that the University
-allows its students to use the lawns to supplement
.the mental exercise ‘received in the classroom.
Without this type of enjoyable physical exercise. we
might allow an important part of our environment,
our bodies, to become useless. At such a time our
activities might be limited tositting around send-
ing complaints to newspaper editors.

 Assemble .-A-it YM&WH/1

 
 
  
  

  by STEVE LUBETSKY

More than 300 members of the
Pittsburgh Jewish community as-
sembled in front of the YM and
WHA- Building on Bellelield Sun-
day’ afternoon to voice their con-
cern for their brethren in the So-
 viet Union. A

"tive of the Soviet Union. described
the matter as "a most critical
challenge to our people—the lib-
 eration of three and a half million
f Jewish hostages in the Soviet Un-
ion."
, “‘After half a century of total
. . isolation and cultural blackout,”
 Poupko affired, “Soviet Jews are
" ‘being reborn. They are petitioning
 the government for their elemen-
 ‘tary. human rights—to be identi-
- tied with their people, homeland,
. and heritage.

' - “We have witnessed the gene-
cide of a third of our people by the

 

 

 

<_l§I_azis due to the indifference out
-*-of personal complaceny of promi-

 

l- -Rabbi Bernard Poupko. a na-

nent people." he recalled. "We
dare not repeat this terrible mis-
take again."

Rep. William S. Moorhead lD.).
who recently visited the Soviet
Union. addressed the rally. He
noted that “many people call this
a ‘Jewish problem.‘

“Is it a problem,” he asked,
‘fwhen people desire to learn their
heritage and educate their youth?
Is it a problem when a man wants
to be evaluated by his intelligence
and not his religious preference?
Is it a problem when one wants
to deal with God on his own
terms?”

Such longings are not problems.
he maintained. "But it is a prob-
lem when the rulers in the Krem-
lin are so unstable and insecure
that they feel the need for a
scapegoat."

Attacking Soviet policies as evi-
dence of "reincarnation." of Stal-
inism. Moorhead declared that
“Stalin may be dead. but the anti-
Semitic spirit lives."

iiJews I ’i'olesl Soviet Kispressioii

The Congressman mentioned the
two alternatives for Soviet Jewry
in the wake of the government’s
policies—“either- mass emigra-
tion or total assimilation. Since
the latter involves complete sacri-
fice of Jewish culture and herit-
age,” he said, “that is no-answer.”

"The Communist system can-
not" permit emigration. or else it
would lose all of its people." he
commented. "Should Brezhnev
open the door. he would be like a
store owner with no customers."

F "We are aware of this issue in
Congress." he assured. "and we
are trying to pass legislation." He
cited a bill he is sponsoring which
includes “an'outright condemna-
tion of the Soviet Union for its ac-
tions.“ It calls upon "President
Nixon to be more vocal about the
matter in dealing with the Krem-

ilin. he explained. and it also ap-
peals to the UN to consider the is- 4

siie.

encountered by these students.

The second function of the RSO
would be to promote a greater
rapport among the campuses.
Brown hopes to accomplish this
through an inter-campus newslet-
ter, which would contain informa-
tion valuable to relocating stu-
dents. The RSO would also hold an
inter-campus V conference, where
future relocating students could
discuss their problems concern-
ing transferring to the main cam-

us.

The RSO was active during the
fall and winter semesters last
year. It sponsored a coffee and
orientation session for relocating
students who were on campus to
register, and also held a social
mixer during the fall.

The RSO was formed in the lat-

‘ ter half’ of 1969 by Gail Paulie.

who was assistant dean of stu-
‘ dents at the time.’ '

"Some poems are screams of
pain. We should not be too critical.
of these poems. for when you are
hurt it is healthy to scream.“ says
poet Galway Kinnell of today's
protest poetry.

Kinnell is a poet-in-residence
with the International Poetry For-
um this fall. in cooperation with
Pitt. Carlow,,C-MU, Point Park.
Duquesne. and Chatham College.

In an interview, Kinnell said
times today are fertile ground for
poetic thought, because “of our
ghastly, unprecedented vision, the
possibility of the extinction of hu-
man life on" earth.” At the same
time, Kinnell " believes poetry

more difficult to achieve, because
“much of the poetry of life itself is
going out of existence.”

Elaborating on this. Kinnel said.
“There are some people still mak-
ing carriages for horses for use
by British royalty. but most peo-
ple are making automobiles. Since
the poet. belongs to the 20th cen-
tury. he is writing 20th century
poems."

Replying to some criticisms
that contemporary poetry is too
involved with government or sci-
ence. Kinnell asserted. "Poetry
can never become too political.

Henry-David Thoreau

As the "State Director" says in the Studio Theatre‘s Production.
Ashes of New England, "Luckily Thoreau’s reputation does not rest on
his poetry but on his essays and occasional lectures."

Lucky for us as 20th century readers. but not so lucky for the ar-
tist himself who died in l862, largelyunread. and socially frustrated.

These are thectypes of conflicts that the show compiled by Pitt sen-
ior Jim Schlotter portrays: the mental perusal—now light—hearted, now
ponderous, they call to a re-discovery of nature—blithe yet apparently
the musings of an eccentric. V '

Thoreau was a complex character—’too complex to be dealt with
superficially though a presentation of a select few "of his writings loose-
ly tied together by a “State Director.”

Fortunately the introduction of the character of H. L. Mencken, the '
cynical. early 20th century critic of Thoreau and Emerson. is very ef-
fective dramatically and adds an interesting aspect to what would
otherwise -be a mere one-diprlnensionaflz recitation. '

. Mencken, played by Dennis Grossman, lends the air of timeless- .
ness and applicability, however, sarcastically and prejudiciously‘sub-
mitted. We are not looking at Thoreau as his 19th century contempor-
aries, and a historical overview is. indispensable: to the type of docu-
mentary compiling Schlotter has done.

The light-hearted whimsical" interpretation director Helen Lip-
chey chooses in terms of Thoreau’s literary creations is much more ef- V

fective in view of an excerpt from
one of Mencken’s trenchant ob-
servations of early transcendental

thought and its critics.

As portrayed by Grossman,
Mencken asserts that‘ although
the “Blue-Nosed, Snuffling” his-
torians have fun "discussing the
lofty idealism of the Pre—Metho-
dists of New England, the actual
facts show "that Puritanistic
thought only served to smother
any attempt at expression. Says
Mencken, “It was not until for-
eign influences slowly percolated
into the country, gave a start to
Transcendentalism, that New

-— England could show so much as a

single third-rate college."

It was in the throes of this in-
tellectual and creative subjuga-
tion and hypocrisy that Thoreau
and Emerson struggled. It is in
this light that The Ashes of New
England works. .

Dennis Grossman’sv portrayal
of H. L. Mencken is superb and
convincing. Due to the weakness

ization bordering onfstereotype.

Thoreau’s written encounters

- , with Emerson and Lidian Emer-
son (Anne C. Twomey) -as-seen

through correspondence and Em-

erson’s eulogy of Thoreau are the ,

highlight of the show. Ann Twom-
ey, despite her minute part, pick-
ed_up the production just when it_
seemed to be dragging. Her entire

effect, aided by the costuming of ,

Lynne Hemingway, (which, was

uniformly well-done) was positive. A

Kenneth -_l\.Ieal as Ralph Waldo
Emerson added little to the strong
show but a strong voice. This may
be due to the poor blocking, mis-
use of -the three-quarter thrust

staging and a bad lighting ar-

rangement.

lllilllllllllllllllllIllllllllllllllllllllIIllIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIE ~
lllllllllllllllllIIlllllllllllllllllllIIllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll

The Pitt Panthers are off to Bayou country this weekend
_ and they may encounter some difficulty from a group of Louisi-
‘ana bandits.

_ No, I’m not referring to the. notorious “Chinese Bandits"
 P of years ‘past from the LSU team, nor to any pickpocket or dere-
- ' lict wandering the streets of the French Quarter in New Orleans.

 .4 Rather, a trio of hoodlums who grace the defensive back-
’  field of Tulane’s squad will provide a stern test for the passing
' effectiveness of the Panther offense.

  Led by All-American candidate Joe Bullard, the threesome

.’ of deep hacks for the Green Wave include Paul Ellis and David
a -Hebert. All three are seniors and have started the past 28 games
*» in their varsity career as a unit.

 Last season, when Tulane compiled‘ an 8-4 record including
i the Liberty Bowl championship over Colorado, the trio inter--
i cepted 22 passes out of/wthe__T_tg=;am total of 2§.A_They are continuing
their theft act this fall”h7ith fi've”stea' s etween them.

If Dave Havern and company move the ball through the air ‘
g with any amount of success, they will
; _ be the first offensive team that has
l ; done so this year “against Tulane’s
§ secondary. In five games this season,
i , only 39 passes have been completed
l V against the unit. A
; Bullard also excells as a punt re-
 ( turn specialist, while the Green Wave ’
, relies on another specialist, Coleman
1,  Dupre for. kickoff returns. Last week,
‘ «f«“Dupre galloped the length of the field‘
‘ for a score against North Carolina. ‘

Despite the bandits, Tulane (2-3)
has been just as erratic“ as the Panthers so far this season. Their
first win came over ‘Texas Tech at the beginning of the cam-
paign, while their "iipset 37-29 victory" over North Carolina
"1 knocked the Tar Heels out of the nation’s top 20.

 Spaced in between were two dismal showings as they suc-
’ , cumbed to Rice and William and Mary, two mediocre to poor
» .-f.W"”clubs. The Green Wave’s other loss’, 17-7 to Georgia,,wa,s some-

‘ thing of a moral victory, although those aren’t recorded in the
books. In all of Georgia’s other games this fall, the Bulldogs

large margins. ‘
;: Tulane’s Head Coach Bennie Ellender, in his firstseason at
 Tulane, admits his team hasn’t been consistent yet. “We’re
 good sometimes, and then we're not so good at other times—we
 have played rather poorly in the second half of some games,”
 he said. ' ' ‘

Neither have the Panthers been a paragon of consistency in
the past five weeks. When the defense has stood firm, the of-
fense has made errors and vice versa.

 Coach Carl DePasqua, though unhappy about the team’s
’ miscues in the first half against Navy, .is far from being despon-
E, dent and complimented the-efforts of the players for the second
5;, half comeback. _

 “We’re a young ball club——a good one,”_ he ‘stated_yeste‘r-
day. “But we have yet to play a full 60 minutes without mis-

ii takes.” . . _ ,
' Before the season started, Tulane was considered oneof the

; Panthers’ top opponents, though the Green Wave has yet to real-

 ly get rolling. Even if Bullardv’s Bandits don’t steal the show Sat-

‘ urday night in the Sugar Bowl, the Panthers will have a tough
time avenging Tulane’s last minute, 26-22, win in 1969.

The weather was gloomy, raining and overcast, at Summit Point.
West Virginia this past weekend, but not nearly as gloomy as the
members of the Road Racing Team as the Camaro incurred mech-
anical difficulties and didn’t finish the race.

According to administrative director Susan Powell,_ “we still are
four points in front of the fourth place car, enough for the invita-
tion for Atlanta."

a 30 minute feature race. the

Today at 1:30 p.m. the soccer
team (3-1) played their third
straight home game on the turf
at Pitt Stadium. However unlike
the previous two games. which

-were against average opponents.
the squad faced one of the best

soccer teams in the nation. Akron.

Scoring, let alone beating.
against the powerful Zips '(4-1)
is no easy task, as their defense
has a 1.00 goals-against average.
including three shutouts in five
matches. The Pittdefense is quite
adept at keeping the score down
too as witnessed by their 1.50
goals-against average.

The Akron offense averages 3
goals a game which is above the
2 goals for average of Pitt. In

'fact the Zips beat_the booters

by a 4-2 score last year in Akron
before 35,000 fans in Akron’s
Rubber Bowl.

Akron’s mentor Bill Killen,- an
All-American at West Chester in
1961, feels his team is even bet-
ter than last year’s nationally
ranked squad. “We’ve got a good,
well balanced offense. The de-
fense speaks for itself with their
three shutouts. Thus I feel we
have a better team than last
year.”

The Akron forward line is led
by Antonio Leonardi, an Italian,
who is the team’s leading scorer
with five goals" in as many gam-
es. Other strikers include Rich
Parkinson and Gene Alfond, two
speedy cousins from Nigeria.
Parkinson is rated by Killen as
“exceptionally good” while Al-
fond is appraised as “pretty
good?"

Defensive standouts are Bimbo
Shoyoye, another Nigerian, and
two Jamaicans, fullback Pat
Aquart and goalie Bo Soloman.
The surprising thing about the
trio is that they are all freshmen.
Killen has four frosh kickers in
his eleven man starting lineup.

Iiiaddition to the three frosh
defenders he also has Joe Schir-
aldi,a freshman forward from Ca-
nada,_ one of two Canadians on
the team, the other one being
fellow forward Mario Dimaggio.
Both boys are from Ontario.

Pitt's hopes of beating the pow-
erful Akron eleven rest on the of-
fense, which up to now has been
unable to score excessively.

Right wing ChuCho Valencia
feels that the main problem is
that "we still don’t know each
other’s,moves that well and as
coach .said*' We’.re 7. putting the ball
into the air-too often as well as
trying to go up the middle too
much."

Suffer Second Loss 
by JANICE BUCCIGROSSI ‘ 1
According to Pitt's freshman football coach Bill Quinter the

Cubs showed “quite a -bit of improvement over the West Virginia . -

game" when they were hosted by Penn State last Friday at Beaver

Stadium, University Park.

The Cubs may have improved since their 33-14 loss against
WVU in the season opener, but their improvement was not sufficient ,
enough to secure a victory—the Pitt frosh suffered their second loss

of the season as they were down-
ed by the Little Nittany ' Lions.
19-6. '

Improvement seemed evident

when, with only 2:25 gone in the .6

second quarter, the Cubs came
across with six points on a one

nan to break into the lead, 6-0. '

Going into the second half‘. the
Cubs still commanded the lead
by a score of 6-3, Penn State
having scored on a 29-yard field
goal in the second quarter.

However the second half found
the Cubs not only unable to hold

back the Lions’ mounting attack, ‘

but also unable to score.

The Little Lions compiled 10
points in the third quarter and
with only 0:24 seconds left in the
game, scored a touchdown on a
17-yard run by Walt Addie. The
Cubs meanwhile could not score

Despite Pitts inabilityto score

was much improved.

With Chips Down

“Mouse” Roars Again ..

by MARK SIGMON

For the second year in a row. Pitt quarterback
Dave llavern has directed the Panthers to a 36-35
victory. Both West Virginia in 1970 and the Naval
Academy last Saturday wilted under four—touched
barrages in the second half with Havern at the helm.

"Mighty Mouse" Havern holds or shares seven
all—time Pitt passing records. He connected on 22
of 37 aerials against the Middies. good for 247 yards
and one TD. Eighteen of the completions came dur-
ing the tenacious Panther uprising in the second
half.

"That first half was really horrible." Hayern
reminisccd. "We made a lot of fundamental mis-
takes at crucial times. especially when we were in
poor field position. 0

“What really gripes me is the conduct of the fans.
particularly the students. All the guys on the team
realized how miserably we had performed in the
first half against Navy. From now on, I’m sure a
number of us (the Cat squad) will be playing only
for ourselves.”

Most of the 24000 spectators who witnessed
the Pitt—.\’av_v carnival were surprised and some-
what .cl),a,gr,ip,etl._,,_t0 seethe Panthers stick to their
time—consuming ball control game plan. even though
behind 35-10.

“Every football fan loves to second-guess the
coach. I guess thats their perogative. sighed Hav-
ern. “But Coach (Carl) DePasqua knows what he is
doing. He gets paid to make decisions. All those
"arm-chair" quarterbacks in the stands simply
don‘t know what they are talking about.

Redshirted back in 1969 due to a bout with mono-

nucleosis,Dave feels that the one year absence was
both beneficial and noxious to him.

“Being redshirted helped me as far as experi-
ence and maturity go. But it hurt me last season in
my bid for the number one quarterback spot.“

Despite his cool. workmanlike performance
against the Middies on Saturday, “Mighty Mouse"
realizes he is not solidly entrenched at the QB slot.

QB DAVE HAVERN prepares to unleash one of his 3.7

aerial probes. Photo by M0715

"Of course, I would like to be the Panther quar-
terback for the rest of the year. -But let’s face it.
John Hogan"and Bob Medwid are fine ballplayers. I
expect to start against Tulane, but Coach DePas-
qua will use us as sees fit, and that’s all right with
me.”

The remaining seven contests on the schedule
will test the Panthers’ spirit and ability. Havern ad-
mitted that it is very easy to get up for Penn State.
Notre Dame. and Syracuse: nevertheless. he is
wary of looking ahead and underestimating an op-
ponent. as Pitt did with Navy.

Dave Havern is five feet nine inches tall and tips
the scales at 160 pounds. Is a future career in pro-
fessional football possible for him‘?

"Realistically, there is no way that I could play - 

in the NFL. because of my size. However, Coach
(Bill) Quinter played up in Canada for a while. In
the Canadian football league, where the quarter-
backs roll out a lot more and with the more wide-

open style of offense, I might have a chance. "

Club’s Future Shaky

Even though the Rifle Club has lost its funding from the Athletic

Department and the Allocations Committee it is still competing in

Collegiate shooting. But for how long is hard to determine.

Last Saturday at the Trees Hall rifle range, the Pitt club went
against C-MU and lost by a score of 1275-1250. The week before Pitt lost
to both West Virginia and Indiana in a triangle meet.

The club is not giving the showing that it did last year when the

iti the crew chief. “It shouldn’t
have. We didn’trev it up that
high. It can go to 8,500 rpm
and when the tachometer broke
it was registering 7,900.”

The true drama of the entire
event occured when after the
fifteenth lap the car driven by
Warren Agar came around be-
fore the Camaro. In fact the Ca-
maro didn’t complete the circuit.

W. Ed Glantz, the fourth place
driver in the Northeastern divi-
sion, didn’t compete this past
weekend thereby assuring the Pitt -
Road Racing Team of the invi-
tation to Atlanta for the National"
championship. «

team finished fifth in the Western
Pennsylvania Inter—Collegiate
League. Sgt. Freeman thinks this
could be blamed on the status of
the club. “They (the members of
the team) don’t know from one
day to the next whether the club
is going to hold together.“

In order for the club to continue
it needs $1,000. This money would
go to paying the coach. The Army
has been supplying the team with

go,” commented Frank ReSCm_ the necessary ammunition and

most of the rifles. Between the
Army and the Air Force, theclub
has been getting transportation to
its away meets.

The Army and Air Force will
continue this supportas long as
the University or the Allocations
Committee funds the club with the
money needed for the coach.

Colonel Mishtowt of the Army"
pointed out, “‘If the Rifle Club

doesn‘t get A $1,000 from some
source, the Rifle Club will die."

On Oct. 22, the club will shoot
against Indiana, a school which

The interest is still there among
the shooters and practice has
been continuing, but this can only
go on fora short while longer.

signal caller position against the
Little Lions. “I was looking for
someone who could move the
ball so I put in Daniels,” stated
Quinter. “Both quarterbacks per-
formed pretty well — one just
moved the ball a little better than
the other.”

Quinter attributed the lack of
scoring to mental mistakes made
by the team and a solid Lion de-
fense. '

"Our biggest breakdown came
when we made a few mental mis-
takes.“ related Quinter. “I also
attribute it to their (Penn States)
tough defense —both teams had a
good defense and there was a
lack of punch on both offenses."

The Cub coach also felt that
his defense lived up to his ex-
pectations. “The defense did pret-
ty well - they just started to play
when they got caught in a blitz.
We caused Penn State to make
four or five fumbles and that’s
got to be a tribute to our de-
fense.”

Quinter found Penn State to
be an impressive team.

Cub halfback Don Siegle, shown here against WVU three weeks ago,
saw little action against the Penn State frosh last Friday. ‘

in religious items. That's why so many people turn to religions

entirely. It is only human to want a religion that de-emphasizes
punishment for sin. However, a bargain may have serious hidden
_ ﬂaws. The thing you buy cheaply often turns out to be worthless.

Genuine Christianity is not a
cheap religion, although many
offer bargains in its name. It was

a critical moment in

READING history when Christ
TIME: had to tell His disci-
2 Minutes ples‘ what His procla-
20 Seconds mation of the truth

would cost Him: cru-
ciﬁxion. Who wants to follow a
defeated leader‘? Christ’s offer
was, "If any man will come after
me, let him deny himself, and
take up his cross daily, and fol-
low me.”

Christianity is a religion of
choice. The consequences of that
choice are clearly set forth in the
Bible. He who chooses Christ is
reconciled with God, born_anew,
assured of eternal life. He who
rejects Christ and chooses to con-
tinue in the sin of a self-directed
life condemns himself to trouble
of_ soul, divorces himself from re-
ality and ultimate purpose, and in
the end suffers eternal loss. Even
the most sophisticated person is
haunted at some time by the fear,
What if I wake up after all this

I

is over and ﬁnd out that I was»
wrong? '

Yet Christianity is not a reli-
gion of fear but of love. Fear may
drive a man to religion, but re-
ligion will drive fear out of a
man. To love God and be lo_ved by
Him makes heroes out of cowards,
sober men out of alcoholics, re-
sponsible and creative men and
women out of ﬂoundering, un-
directed, confused human beings.
Christianity is not mere morality,
it is commitment to a person, the
Lord Jesus Christ. The price isn't
cheap. It cost Christ His life; it
will cost you your ego-ﬁlled per-
sonality,’ your right to self-direc-
tion; it will bring you into oppo-
sition with the world.

But the cross was followed by
the resurrection. When you take
up the cross and follow Christ,
your feet will be set on a road
that leads to joy, peace, released
creativity, and relatedness to
what life is all about, here and
hereafter. The Christian life will
cost you something, but it's
worth it. Its joys surpass its sor-
rows. Try it.

When the Pitt Panthers marched out of the locker room after half-

they knew they had to do.

This moved the Greenies one step

mented that “we knew we could
win, if the breaks went our way.“

Whether it is fortunatewor :n_ot,_m
the Panthers have very few op-

ponents left that they can take as
lightly as they appeared to have
taken Navy. Time will tell how
well they prepare themselves.
Halftime notes: ’
John Hogan was removed from
Saturday’s contest early in the

first half. He complained of grog-.
giness and had a difficult time

‘orienting himself. This condition

resulted ‘from a blow he received
in the second quarter of Satur-
day’s game. Hogan only complet-
ed one of five passes for 21
yards. '

The Panthers escaped from the
Navy game sore but mostly free

of serious injuries, except for one. 1

Lance Wall will be out for the
season as he underwent surgery
on Sunday for torn cartilage in his

‘ knee.

fine five-hit pitching of Greenie
Bill McBride who missed a shut-
out only because of an error by
one of his teammates. Bill Hutton
provided the power in the line—up
as he homered and tripled while
driving in two runs.

Greenie Bob McCrearie opened
the scoring with a two-run double
in the first, driving in John Ting-
ley and Hutton ahead of him. Hut-
ton homered in the fourth, a solo
blast, which he followed with a

RBI triple in the sixth inning. *

Other scoring came on a two-run

’ doifble by Bill Fisher in the fourth

and a solo homer by Bunk Hill in
the sixth.

Ashbrook singled in the first to
knock in Saggio for the Feets’ only
run. It was unearned.

The victory moved the Greenies’
record to 3-0 and into‘a first place

tie with the Buzzards. The Buz— '

zards are a team composed of
many varsity basketball players
and captained by Kent Scott and
hard hitting Ken Waggoner. The

Greenies play the Buzzards Wed- I,

nesday at 5:15 p.m. This game
will most likely decide the Amer-

ican Independent Division Cham-~

pionship.
