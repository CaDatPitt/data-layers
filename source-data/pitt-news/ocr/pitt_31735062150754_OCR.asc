Cadet Unit at University
War Department Is Organizing’

College Groups UnderiNew Plan C

Having colors of blue and gold and the University’s name, a ﬂying

department’s policy to form college

;.-cadet unit will be formed atthe University in accordance with the war

units throughout_ the country.

-Under the new ‘arrangement, a unit of 20 men from Pitt will be

picked to "form a section to be
known as the University of Pitts-
burgh Flying Cadet unit. These
men will be trained together and,
completing their training at the
same ‘time, will enter the‘ army as
a single composite body of ﬂyers.
Prior to the new system, ﬂying

fcadets enlisted as individuals and
.were ‘trained as such with no at-

tempt being naade to group men
from the same school. This new
plan is purely voluntary -for the
colleges.
Chancellor Approves

When the letter was sent to the
requesting the chan-

unit _at_ Pitt, Chancellor John G.
Bowman. immediately wired his ap-
proval and support of the scheme
to the headﬂof the third corps area.

When the Chancellor had given
his approval, Second ‘Lieutenant

‘George E. Sutton was sent to the

University by the War department,
arriving Saturday." Lt. Sutton will
remain at the University until the
close of the school year, interview-
ing sophomores, juniors, and sen-

. iors who are interested in becoming

ﬂying ‘cadets. Interviews are be-
ing conducted in the military de-
partment offices on the fourth floor.

Those who are chosen will not
remain at the University but will
leave at a scheduled time to begin
their elementary training. ~ '
Seven-month ‘Period

The course consists of ‘seven
months’ training period -during
which the cadet is paid $75;a-month
and receives room and board. When
the course is ﬁnished, the ﬂying
cadet acquiresa commission as sec-
ond lieutenant in the army and re-
ceives the pay and allowances given
to officers of similar military rank
in the regular army.

Applicants should be between the
ages of. 20 and 27, unmarried, a
United States citizen, be able to
pass a physical examination, and
agree to serve in the army-for three
years on‘ active duty as a reserve
oﬁicer. , -

During his stay at the. Univer-
sity, Lt. Sutton will advise students
of the opportunities-offiered by the
army to ﬂying cadet applicants and
will aid them in ﬁlin-g__,the‘ir.app11_

Fourth Months’ Work

Independent association" com-
pletes four months of its existence
today when it meets at 12:30. o’clock
in. 132 Cathedral‘ to elect the ﬁrst
permanent oﬁicers of the organiza-
tion under the new constitution.

Since its organization, IA has
sponsored two dances, the Big-I
ball and the Black-I ball, in its ef-
fort to provide a low-cost recrea-
tional program for the student who
lacks the opportunity through non-
fraternity membership.

During four months existence, the
membership committee has suc-
ceeded in enrolling 300 members,
and has planned for large member-
ship drives next year. — '

The educational committee spon-
sored a symposium‘ at which stu-
dent leaders Joseph Roberts, BA41;
and Ruggero Aldisert, C41, spoke
on the status of student govern-
ment at Pitt.

Next year the association will at-

Parke Submits Yearly Report ,

On Activities of Men’ s Council

In order to review the activities
of Men’s council for the past year,
Don Parke, C41, retiring president,
has submitted the following report.

“During the last year, Men’s
council has continued several of its
well-established student services.
The book exchange operated dur-
ing both semesters and made a good
proﬁt which was turned over to the
Men’s Student Loan fund. The
fund has served needy students in
the last year.”

Freshman Aid

“The Freshman Customs pro-
gram was also continued, and for
the second year we have been work-
ing on a plan to aid freshman men
who have made grades below aver-
age and who have not participated
in any University activities. By
means of personal interviews, we
hope to ﬁnd out if we can help these
men to improve their scholarship
and interest them in some student
activity. A smoker for men trans-
fer students was held again this
year.” _ . . . .

“We have also considered the
feasibility for teaching seniors how
to write letters of application for
jobs, but this was- abandoned ‘be-

cause it is not as necessary as it
used to be to search for employ-

ment by means of letters of appli-
cation.”

New Projects

“As for the new projects that
have been instituted by Men’s coun-
cil this year, they have been a tea
dance to honor senior football play-
ers and a student-faculty hobby
show which aroused considerable
interest and which will be contin-
ued next year. The Bridge club
was organized by the council and
has had a constant attendance at
every meeting by all of its 20 mem-
bers. It will be continued next year
also.”

“Perhaps the project which will
be most beneﬁcial to the student
body, if we succeed in putting it
through, is the plan for a student
athletic association. This plan,
which is being considered ‘by the
Faculty Association on Athletics,

is designed to give the student a,_

voice in the‘Universi‘ty ‘athletic pol-
icy and to promote a better under-
standing by the students of the
long-range athletic policy that the
'University'is ‘working out.” '

F or Zoo Post

Professor Will Rest,
But Is Silent an. Offer

Dr. Samuel H. Williams, profes-
sor of biology and zoology, made
no comment Friday on the city’s
offering him the post of superin-
tendent of Highland Park zoo, but
told Pitt friends that he will remain
on the University faculty.

Dr. Williams spoke from his sick
bed in the Eye and Earlhospital
where he has been conﬁned for al-
most two weeks with a throat in-
fection.

Ordered to take a long rest by
his family physician, Dr. Williams
has just been granted a year’s leave
of absence by the University.

Concurrent with this permission
came the city’s offer of the zoo po-
sition.

“I am still a member of the Uni-
versity faculty,” Dr. Williams stat-
ed. “Further than this, I have no
comment.” He would not talk with
city newspapermen, and was al-
lowed to see only close friends, due
to the seriousness of his illness.

During his year’s leave Dr. Wil-
liams said he plans to go to Florida
where he will rest and ﬁnish two
books, one a text and the other a
book on his travels.

Temporarily, the zoo post has
been given to Edward J. House,
Pittsburgh coal operator, big game
hunter, and former president of the
Pittsburgh Zoological society. House
told city oﬁ"lcials he would not be
able to keep the position longer

Professor Sees “7ar
As Struggle For Unity

In line with the policy of presenting well
thought out opinions on the current war situa-
tion, we print below excerpts from an article
by Frederick L. Schuman, Woodrow Wilson
Professor of Government, Williams college.

“The Second World War is a war being fought
for the political uniﬁcation of the world. Its
outcome will decide who will unify the world . . .

“No war was ever won against people with
a mission and a crusading faith by people with
no motive save fear and no purpose save sur-
vival and passive defense. This war cannot be
won unless we can formulate some positive pur-
pose for which we are willing to give much
and risk much. Platitudes about the “four free-
doms” are not enough. What are Britain’s offi-
cial war aims? To survive. To destroy Hitler-
ism. To restore the “sovereignty” and “inde-
pendence” of conquered peoples. To put
Humpty-Dumpty back onthe wall. To restore
the world of 1939 or 1938 or 1919. These things
are impossible. They will never be done. What
are America’s war aims? We have none. What
are our peace aims? National defense. Freedom.
A better peace treaty at the next peace confer-
ence.“: Empty words without relevance to the
world we live in .

“We stand between» two dangers. One is
that our aid to Britain may be too little and too
late. If Britain falls, the Triple Alliance will
unify the world. The other is that we may pre-
vent a British defeat, drift into active hostilities,
amass ships and guns and tanks and planes, and
ﬁnally defeat the foe without achieving any
control over our destinies or any vision of a
world order other than an Anglo-American alli-
ance, which will fall apart with the peace, and
a revived League of Nations, which will again
be betrayed by American isolationists and Brit-
ish Tories. A Nazi victory would be preferable.

“A Nazi Victory is indeed certain if Britishers
and Americans have no more to offer to the
world and to themselves than this. There is no
reason to believe that a democratic world feder-
ation can be created at the next peace confer-
ence. There is no reason to believe that the
war can be won without its creation now. The
peoples of conquered Europe and the youth of
America will make none of the sacriﬁces neces-
sary for victory unless they are given a faith in
something far beyond the restoration of the
status quo and unless that faith is translated
into works now  .

“There can be no survival without victory.
There can be no victory without a new vision
of freedom at home, translated into deeds now,
and a new vision of a democratic world federa-
tion, translated into deeds now.”

——From SOS, publication of the Student
Defenders of Democracy.

A StrongAlumni:
A Great University

Opening its annual. membership drive among
seniors and alumni, the General Alumni asso-
ciation says: “No University can become truly
great without a strong alumni organization.”

: With that statement we most hearitly agree.
1 We believe that the University will never
achieve the strong alumni association it needs
unless the alumni themselves support their own
organization. No University subsidy should be

. needed, for a University should be aided by—-

and not aid—its alumni group when it comes to

; ﬁnances.

We are fortunate in having a few men who
will donate large sums to the University for
varied purposes, but we would be more fortunate
if. the alumni were able to ﬁnance a Student
Union building or a scholarship fund through
donations ofindividual members of the graduate
organization. Other schools are able to estab-
lish alumni funds for such purposes. Why not
Pitt?

A strong alumni association requires that one
thing for sure success—increased membership in
the alumni association with the attendant in-
creased dues and funds.

The success or failure of the present mem-
bership drive will be indicative of the desire of
the seniors and the alumni to answer that chal-
lenge: “No university can become truly great
without a strong alumni organization.”

Labor Study Belittles
Damage of Lost Days

The nation’s press is currently denouncing
labor for disrupting national defense through
strikes and sabotage, allegedly inspired from
points East.

Latest release of the Washington official bu-
reau of labor statistics reveals the relative
“scourge” of strikes during 1940. Total man-
days lost in industrial plants due to strikes: 6,-
500,000. Total man-days lost due to temporary
accidents: 46,000,000. Total man-days lost due
to deaths (at 6,000 days each) and permanent
disabilities (est. 1,000 days each) brings the
accident total to 235,700,000.

The Gallup poll revealed that in 1940 an
estimated 59,000,000 man-days were lost due to
colds and ﬂu.

Summary: Total man-days lost due to
strikes in 1940: 6,500,000. Due to other causes:
298,700,000. Ratio——46 to 1. The red herring is
losing color. '  _

Nettik Returns to Bid
Adieu to Commeneers

oscar shefler

(Editor’s note: It has been quite a while since the
last coke-bottle message went bobbing 013‘ from Canar-
sie to our Mr. Nettik on his desert island. For those
of you who have forgotten, the column printed below
is a copy of a letter sent to Mr. Nettik, who has been
living on a desert island, probably the world’s Oldest

isolationist, excluding possibly one gentleman from

Montana. With this we intend to retire the column
and your janglved nerves.)
Dear Nettik:

Things have been happening so fast that I haven’t
been able to write you as soon as I should. All the
members of the faculty and the administration here
are being shuttled about from one position to another.
One professor I know of was taking a street-car to
school when he ran into a member of the administra-
tion, got off and took a taxi, heard the latest campus
rumor from the cabbie, and got out at the ﬁrst Cadillac
dea1er’s storeroom. When last heard of, he was still
on the way to school, this time mounted upon a camel’s
back and wearing an emerald in his turban,

We are going to commence the night of June 11th.
This is the ﬁrst time they’ve ever held the graduation
exercises in the evening and on the lawn. I think it
all started last year when three candidates for doc-
tor’s degrees walked off the platform and signed up
with the WPA project working on the stadium. Even
so, I’ve seen a few of the senior class practicing up
their whacks with the family lawn-mower.

That war is still going on over on the other side
of your island. The English have been completely
pushed out of Europe. At the rate things are hap-
pening, one expects the Nazi army to start a real
offensive, through Asia, across the Atlantic, by way
of transcontinental America, and eventually wind up
attacking their own men from the rear.

Gene Autry got an. honorary degree from our uni-
versity, as did his horse, Champion. We hear that
Penn is going to follow up the honorary they con-
ferred on FDR last year with a special degree for
Falla. They have lots of lawn and we hope the
Scottie is grass-broken.

Everyone is writing farewell columns these days.
One of the best was done by a fellow named Kalwary,
but I ﬁgure he’s been at it long enough to get the
general hang of it.

No face, no arms, no legs, had he; "
I met him stalwart in my way,

Plunged deep my blade, fast shook it free,
Shook blood on him, shook blood on me.

He was a uniform in gray:
For face he had a grotesque mask;
How was he? fair? dark? who can say;
To kill, not question, was my task.-

Death was out last night:
She rode on the tail of a Junkers;
She pointed an anti-aircraft gun at a
Shadow ten thousand feet in the sky;
She hung on to the twirling ﬁns of a
Two thousand pound delayed-action bomb;
She touched a boy of ten and a baby of six months;
She stepped with the ﬂat sole of her foot
On a packed air-raid shelter;
Then she turned away her face in disgust.
Bombs are bursting, planes are falling
All through the night;
Voices choked with blood are calling,
Praying for light;
Day will give the gunner sight,
Give the smoking shell new might,
Down the wrong, uphold the right.

Gersho-vitz Asks Poser,
Passes the Buck-Buck

Editor, the Pitt News:

The more one talks to people
about the war, national defense,
and the rest of this country’s prob-
lems, the more one ﬁnds evidence
of confused and muddled thinking.
The very ones who ask us to be
realistic, like England, are them-
selves guilty of the worst kind of
unrealism.

They ask that England be aban-
doned; that we stay at home and
arm till we are unbeatable by any
power or combination of powers.
They ask us to solve our economic
problems at home and forget about
Dakar, Buck Buck and Baghdad.

0 Stick to England

In the ﬁrst place, can they possi-
bly believe that England will not be
crushed if we do not help her by
giving much more effective aid
than we are now proving though it
be short of an AEF? There isn’t a
military man that doubts England’s
collapse if we abandon her. Sec-
ondly can they seriously doubt that
as soon as England falls that this
country will become a dictatorship
almost at once?

The world has seen too well how
ineffective verbose . legislatures are
in combatting concentrated power
of dictators.

And ﬁnally there is the fact
which should be most obvious of
all; the fact that a country does not
cure its economic and political prob-
lems while engaging in the most
stupendous defense program that
the world has ever seen, (even Sen-
ator Wheeler wants such a defense
force). When 30 and 40 billions
are spent for cannons, the butter
waits. Englishmen and Germans
alike will bear this out. Already
the newspape-r cartoons, clamor
against “non-defense” expendi-
tures. What will they say when
and if Hitler does win?

0 On the Piccadilly

The hemispheric isolationists must
look at the other side of the war
question. They must realize that
the day Hitler goosesteps along
Piccadilly Square, that “bad” man
in the White House will, of neces-
sity, become a dictator; the bill of

l14ncl€aa.l'e«.ﬁ1/Valec£,,,

rights will become unconstitutional.
Our home problems will be forgot-
ten; our entire efforts will be ex-
pended on breathlessly preparing
for a life and death struggle for the
future. And who knows how many
years will pass before the fall of a
Nazi-World will allow us to relax
and breathe easy as a democracy
again?

No one wants Roosevelt to mimic
Churchill with the already time-
worn words, “too late.”

Former Pitt Student
Writes From Trinidad

(Editor’s note: We got a post-
card a couple of days ago from Port
of Spain, Trinidad, an island in the
British West Indies up north of the
coast of Venezuela, South Amer-
ica. The card was mailed by Sid-
ney Needleman, now a. soldier, but
last year a college freshman, glee
club and debate team member. The
card shows a straw-hatted native
of Scotland Bay monkeying around
in some shallow water with what
appears to our anti-sports editor
to be “a ﬁshnet or some damn
thing.”)

Editor, the Pitt News:

Hello Peter and Polly Pitt.

As an ex-Pitt student, I was
thinking perhaps some of you re-
call me.

As one of “Uncle’s” soldiers, I am
visiting a “Travelogue” country—en
route to Panama.

Interesting is certainly no word
for Trinidad; two wheeled donkey
carts, colored crones “totin” huge
packs on their heads, kids clamor-
ing for “yings”—bananas, shillings,
ha-pence, etc. What an adventure.

I wish I could see the “News.”
So long,

SIDNEY NEEDLEMAN.

ogy at the University’s Johnstown

I 1’ We Use British Army to Buy
Time, They Will Hate Us Later

. By HORACE UMBERGER

Because of certain theories which
our government holds today, we are
building up a potential hatred to-
ward ourselves amongst the British
people. This hatred will evidence
itself most clearly when, and if.
Britain wins the war. Whether we
go into the battle whole—hog, or re-
main, as at present, an arsenal of
democracy will make little differ-
ence.

Production of the particular bit-
terness referred to began when that
historic law, HR 1776, still remain-
ed in its committee” stage. Then,
defenders of the bill appeared to
give evidence that this was an es-
sential to America’s foreign policy.
And during the course of the testi-
mony, the idea came forth that by
supplying England with materials
and credit, we were “buying time.”
0 Vice-Prexy Wallace

Late in February, no less a per-
son than Vice-President Wallace
stated the same theory, but in some-
what different wording.

According to him, “our only hope
for peace is to prevent England
from being destroyed by the Nazis.”
In other words, America is to keep
its ease by supplying the English
with enough ammunition to~carry
on the killings “over there.”

That phrase, buying time, is one
of the worst blunders we have ever
made. Such an attitude is a mis-
conception of the case.

0 The Real Aim
Only when the bill, HR 1776, be-

4000 Enroll

the regular courses now offered

during the regular 9-month school
year.

Absorption of the summer courses
in the regular curriculum and di-
vision of course instruction to per-
mit students who so desire to at-
tend school only nine months of the
year, are problems which have not
been completely solved.

Details of the 12-month program
are slightly jumbled, Fitzgerald in-
dicated, but he exclaimed, “If we
can do it, we will.”

Under the continuous program, a
freshman entering when 18 years
of age may complete his entire col-
lege training in 3 years when he
will be 21 years old. Such a sys-
tem will eliminate the possibility of
selective service induction inter-
fering with college training.

The provost has conferred with
Stanton C. Crawford, dean of the
College; Dr. Vincent W. Lanfear,
dean of men and newly appointed
dean of the School of Business Ad-
ministration; and Dr. E. W. Jacob-
son, dean ofthe School of Educa-
tion, all of whom are studying the
continuous 12'-month _curriculum.

came a law was the real aim cor-
rectly presented. Our President
said, “Through this legislation, our
country has determined to do its
full part in creating an adequate
arsenal of democracy. This great
arsenal will be here in this ountry.

“It will be a bulwark of our own
defense. It will be the source of the
tools of defense for all democracies
who are ﬁghting to preserve them-
selves against aggression.”

0 Plan Breaks Again

But the former play of buying
time again broke, out in secretary
Hull’s address inaugurating foreign
trade week. He stated, “We are a
practical people. When we set our-
selves to a task we ﬁnish it. We
have set ourselves to the task of
arming and supplying those whose
successful defense is vital to our
security.” Thus, according to this
theory, we are killing off British to
save our souls.

All of this means one thing. After
the present crisis, win or lose, the
British will hate us for years to
come. They will claim that we
bought time and never paid up. For
no payment can be made to replace
the loss caused by the slaughter of
human bodies.

We were “Uncle Shylock” in the
last war because of greediness. Aft-
er this war, we can expect to be re-
garded as something much, very
much worse than that.

Panthers Snap Middies’ “I
9 Game Win Streak, 4-3

The Panther baseball team won
a surprise victory last Saturday aft-
ernoon at Annapolis when they
snapped a nine game winning
streak of the Navy Midshipmen, 4-3,
to boast their season’s record to 10
victories against two losses.

Norman Smith, Middie hurler,
suffered his ﬁrst defeat in 8 starts
this season. Smith allowed only
seven hits, but his team made six
errors behind him.

Bobby Malloy, sophomore foot-
baller, recorded his 6th win this
season, allowing 10 hits, but being
very stingy with base hits in the
pinch.

Vaiksnor Hits

Pitt’s defense was superb as only

one error was committed, that a
harmless one by Straloski. The
power in the batting lineup was
not up to par, but Smith was the
best pitcher that they faced all
year. .
The Panther’s opened the scor-
ing in the ﬁrst inning when they
scored two runs to jump into the
lead. Eddy Straloski, veteran sec-
ond sacker, opened the contest with
a single, then Vaiksnor, leading Pitt
batsman, followed with another
single. Outﬁelder Al Bush sacriﬁced
the runners one base, then came an
error on. the part of the Navy short-
stop that let two runners cross the
home plate.

The score remained 2-0 until the
third inning when Edgar Jones
opened with a single to right ﬁeld.
Johnny Vaiksnor then hit Pitt’s
only extra base blow of the day,
a double, which brought Jones to
third. Another error by the Mid-
die team, this time by catcher Wal-

F i jis Duel Delts
In Delayed IF
Golf Playoffs

Another delay in the intramural
program occurred last weekend
when the semi-ﬁnal and ﬁnal
rounds of the fraternity golf and
tennis races were washed out.

On the golf frontthe Phi Gamma
Delta team meets the Delta Tau
Delta twosome. The Fijis lost an
early season game to the Phi Eps,
who ended in third place, by a close
margin. The Phi Gam team is com-
posed of Bobby Thurbon and Bill
Clemmer. Thurbon has been shoot-
ing in the high 70’s all year, while
Clemmer is in the low 80's.

For the Delts, it will be footballer
Harris Hawkins and Saylor, neither
of which can match the ﬂashy play
of Thurbon, but both have played
a very consistent brand of golf in
each of their matches.

With their early season upset
over the Phi Gams, the Phi Eps two-
some of Ralph Nadler and Chuck
Cuden almost vaulted into ﬁrst
place, but as the season drew near
a close they were eliminated and
had to satisfy themselves with third
place. , ‘

In tennis, it was exactly the op-
posite as a strong ﬁnishing streak
of eleven straight matches gave the
Phi Eps ace netters, Jim Deutle-
baum and Wally Hiersch, a chance
against the winner of the Delts and
the Phi Delts match today.

Playing for the Delts will be Mc-
Connon and Beattie, while facing
them on the other side of the net
will be two of the steadiest players
in the league, Bill Jones and Bob
Ferris.

In the last half of the fourth the
Middie team pushed over two runs

The following inning the Navy
squad tied up the ball game at 3-3.
A walk, and two hits accounted for
the run.

Pitt Golf Team Thinclads Look Ahead to IC4A Meet

Loses Finale

To Midshipmen

Art Underwood’s Panther golf
team bowed out of the local sport
scene last Saturday afternoon when
they lost their ﬁnal match of the
season to Navy, 5-4.

This match was the closest of the
season for the score see-sawed back
and forth several times, but bad
breaks and poor shooting lost the
tilt for the home forces.

Joe Hunt, famous tennis player,
took Navy’s ﬁrst point when he de-
feated junior Bill Kramer, 4 and 2.
Seniors Jack Glenn and Bob Sey-
bold won their ﬁnal collegiate golf
matches, 2 and 1, and 1 up, re-
spectively.

Glenn sensational play this year
was the only bright spot in an
otherwise mediocre season. Glenn
tied for the lead in individual scor-
ing in the EIGA race.

Simpson, Butcher, and Walk-
ingshaw all lost their matches to
their Middie opponents, but won
their best ‘ball matches to keep
Pitt in the running.

Fraternities Place Eight Men
On News All-Intramural Team

. By JERRY mrr ,

For the second consecutive year
the fraternities walked off with
eight places on the Pitt News All-
Intramural teams. The independ-
Vents ﬁlled the four remainingspots,
leaving the engineers entirely, off
the all-star squad. Three houses,
the Phi Kaps, Phi Eps, and Phi
Gams each had two men on the ﬁrst
team with the Phi Delts and PiKA
taking the other two posts. 2

Easily the outstanding ‘member
of the squad was Phi Kap hurler
Mike Sotack. Besides being the
only unanimous choice for ﬁrst
team, Sotack was chosen co-captain
of the mythical team along with
Larry Paffrath, Whitesox ﬁrst sack-
er. While it is true that it takes
nine men to make up a team and
that no one man can do it all by
himself, Sotack was as near to be-
ing the whole show as any «player
seen on the local campus in a long
time.

Outstanding Pitchers

Running behind the “Great Mike”
were such capable pitchers as Jim
Gleeson of the Cardinals, Jay Sil-
verberg, Phi Epsilon Pi, and Fred
“no hit” Davis, Pi Kappa Alpha.
Silverberg was not only selected for
his steady hurling, but also for his
slugging ability. Davis ﬁrst at-
tracted fame when he pitched. a no
hitter early in the season and yet
lost the game. However, he won
more than his share of games even
though he didn’t have too powerful
a team behind him.

Most good -pitchers usually have
a good man receiving them. This
year’s crop of catchers was excep-
tionally good and it was hard to de-
cide just which one was the best.
After due consideration Frank Dax,
Phi Kappa, was picked as the ablest
backstop of the group. Besides
handling the hard, fast shoots of his
all-star team mate, Sotack, with
ease, Dax supplied» the punch for
the Neville street nine which are
one of the Greek circuit crown’s
leading contenders.

Co-captain Again

Basketball co-captain for next
season, Larry Paffrath was adjudged
the outstanding ﬁrst baseman for
the season. For his inspiring and
smart playing, he was selected as
co-captain of this year’s team.

Showing that he was as good a

second sacker as he was a catcher,
Kenny Grossett, Phi Gam, was the
only repeated from last season’s
intramural team. Last year he
was selected as the outstanding re-

, ceiver_ of M the season, ‘but , switched

to the keystone sack this term and
proved himself to be equally at
home behind the mound ‘as he was
in front of it.

Wally.. Hirsch, Phi Ep shortstop,
was votedsthe tops at his difficult
position. While he wasn’t too
smooth in the ﬁeld, Wally more
than made up for his erratic ways
at short with his big bat. Showing
the way to his mates in slugging
consistently, he, along with Jay
Silverberg were mainly responsible
for keeping the Phi Eps in the run-
ning for the fraternity league cup.
Sell Excels

At third base, Phi Delt Bob Sell,
took the honors because of his ex-
cellent defensive -play. Sell re-
peatedly turned sure base hits into
putouts w"th miraculous stops and
accurate throws to ﬁrst.

Phi Gam Johnny Bitner, Frank
Lally, Medical Sophs, and Craw-
ford of the Cardinals made up the
first string outﬁeld. Lally’s appear-
ance on the team marks the ﬁrst
time a medical student has been
selected as one of the top men in
intramural mushball.

I    I o I o - Once In ALifetime

Although few students at Pitts-
burgh are conscious of the high re-
gard. in which the Panthers are held
in track and ﬁeld circles, the feats
of the University cinder teams since
the coming of Carl Olson to the lo-
cal scene in 1932 have been the
outstanding track accomplishments
of all time.

With the annual ICAAAA track
and ﬁeld championships coming this
Saturday, much interest will be
centered on the attempt of the Pitt
team to win its second straight title
and third in the last ﬁve years. In
thinking of Pitt in connection with
this event, one recalls feats of past
Panther teams in ICAAAA meets
and other competitions.

Long John Woodruff

Probably no one athlete repre-
senting the University has done
more to spread the good name of
Pitt around the entire world than
Long John Woodruff. Winner of
the Olympics in 1932, the dusky
middle distance runner’s name was
on the lips of track enthusiasts all
over Europe, in headlines in China
and Japan, and in track stories told
in every American city or hamlet
that has ever heard of the cinder
sport.

Woodruﬁ led the Panthers to vic-
tories in the ICAAAA meet his
sophomore year and the Penn Re-
lays sweep his senior year. The
only other team performance in the
annals of track and ﬁeld that match-
es the six-man stunt Pitt performed

in u>in?zisia‘g"r6ar relay titles in‘ IES38’; ‘

is that of Louisiana State’s in 1932
when Glenn Hardin and Jack Tor-
rance led the Tigers to a ﬁve-man
championship in the NCAA meet,
where powerful teams from South-
ern California, Stanford, Michigan,
and Ohio State had squads of twen-
ty competing.

Fifteen Wins

A dual meet win streak, started
in 1937, ran to ﬁfteen consecutive
triumphs. In compiling this long
win record, Pitt teams downed Penn
State three times——and the Lions
have long rated among the to-p
teams in track and ﬁeld competition.
Indiana fell twice before Olson-
coached squads and mighty Michi-
gan, with a consecutive winning
streak dating back to 1934, lost its
ﬁrst test in 24 starts to the Blue and
Gold thin-clads last spring.

But one achievement is unique in
this brilliant story of successes—the
most recent chapter added to Olson’s

book. It occurred last spring at
Cambridge, Massachusetts, in the
forty seventh running of the

ICAAAA championships.

It wasn’t that Pitt had won the
title that this feat was unique; Pitt
had won the title before. It wasn’t
because a one-man show, as John
Woodruff might have put on, occur-
red, because there__ weren’t any
Woodruf’f’s at Cambridge. What
did happen? - ,,

The University of Pittsburgh
track team won this coveted ___title
without‘ scoring’ a "single ﬁrst place.

By Ben F oote

Never since the revival of this an-
cient Greek sport had any team
won a major amateur title, either
collegiate or independent, without
scoring at least one ﬁrst place.

It was a story of second, third,
and even fourth places. Penn
State’s Negro sprinting sensation,
Barney Ewell, won three titles, but
in each event where he got ﬁve
points a Pitt man came second with
four points. And in the 100-yard
dash Happy Stickel and Frank Ohl
matched Ewell point for point,
Stickel taking second and Ohl ﬁfth.
Ohl had already been second to
Ewell in the broad jump and 220.

Lots of Seconds

Ed Dugger of Tufts won two
hurdle titles, but sticky Mr. Stickel
stuck right behind in second again.
Jim Elliott ﬁnished a close second
to Penn State’s Nick Vukmanic in
the javelin, but again a Pitt man
was but one point behind. With
Dave McDowell tieing for second
in the high behind a Manhattan
boy, the Pitt team’s growing total
put them out in front of Penn State.
Johnny Bazyk added a third in the
shot put to the score and the mile
relay team came through with
fourth.

Penn State, Tufts, Manhattan,
California, New York U.—all had
greater individual representations
than Pitt, but Olson’s boys won. It
had never happened before; it
mightnever happ_en_again. A ma-
jor titlel without ;a"sin‘g“le“ﬁ'rst place!

'Page'Ta I,

In Trouncing Cadets at West Point

Pi‘t’s squad of thinclads came
through with its ﬁnest perform-
ance of the season last Saturday
afternoon at West Point to "hand
the Cadets their ﬁrst loss in ﬁve
dual meets this season by the deci-
sive margin of 76% to 491,5.

Bullet Bill Carter again played
the standout role for the Panther
team when he scored 13 points for
the best individual scoring of the
day. Carter won the 100-yard dash
and the 220-yard dash, and took a
second in the broad jump.

Although defeat was forseen
early in the day’s festivities, Army
men came through with brilliant
efforts in the ﬁeld events to estab-
lish new Academy records. Jim

White, veteran Cadet javelin man,
outthrew Jim Elliott, Pitt’s Penn
Relay champion, as he set the new
mark of 226‘ feet 10 inches. This
was the best heave of the year
made by any college man.

In the high jump event, Dave
McDowell, veteran Panther jumper,
was beaten by inches when Cadet
Deffke leaped 6 feet 2 inches for
another new Academy record.
Carter vs. Stickel

The 100-yard dash race between
Hap Stickel and Bill Carter was
one of the closest of the day. After
trailing for half the distance, Car-
ter put on a ﬁnishing kick that put

Panther Team
Meets Grovers

In Final Net Tilt

Rained out in the season’s semi-
ﬁnal with West Virginia, Pitt’s in-
consistent tennis team winds up
racquet festivities for the year in a
return match today at Grove City.

A rescheduled match with the
Mountaineers has not as yet been
made. The boys had; started swat-
ting the ball at Trees’ courts last
Thursday, when the sudden thun-
dershowers stopped all activity.

The Panthers shouldn’t have
much trouble in repeating a 6-3 tri-
umph over the Grovers chalked up
earlier in the year. Grove City will
ﬁnd a much improved group of
Panther racquet wielders to con-
tend with this time. And the possi-
bilities of a Pitt shutout victory
seem very promising.

Goehring, Nickeson, and Gaenger
each took singles victories in the
ﬁrst Grove City match. But it was
due to a clean sweep in the doubles
duels that the Panthers managed to
gain the 6 to 3 triumph.

Winning doubles combinations in
that match had Wynn teamed with
Goehring, Trimble playing with
Grance, and Gaenger paired with
Reese. Probably the same setup
will be used in the second Grove
City encounter.

Opposing the Panthers will be
McCloskey, Hulton, Steck, Wielder,
and McDowell. Hulton and Steck
are a couple of netmen with better
than average ability and ought to
be troublesome for their Blue and

him into ﬁrst place. Carter's time
was 9.8. Then later in the 220-
yard sprint, Carter beat both Stick-
el and Tregoning in the time of
21.5.

Del Anderson, running his last
race before the ICAAAA meet next
week, scored a double in the half
mile and mile races. Larkin gave
Anderson the greatest competition
in the half mile race, but Anderson
broke the tape ﬁrst in the time of
2200.5. Two Cadets, Moore and
Brown, challenged Anderson in the
mile race right on down to the
ﬁnish.line, but again the Pitt senior
came through with a ﬁrst place.
His time for the mile was 4:32.
Gillis Wins Hurdles

Gillis, one of the country’s fore-
most hurdlers, took his specialty,
the 120-yard high hurdles, from
Panther Newman, but had to -be
content with second in Stickel’s
specialty, 220-yard low hurdles. It
was Stickels’ only ﬁrst of the day,
and it was in the better-than-aver-
age time of 22.9. The Gillis-Newman
race in the high hurdles was taken
in 14.5.

Dusty Rhoades, versatile athlete,
was reported to be on the injured
list before the meet, but apparently
was in good enough shape to com-
pete Saturday afternoon. He scored
a second in the discus and a tie for
fourth in the pole valut.

Football captain, Ted Konetsky,
threw the discus 132 feet 71/2 inches
for a Pitt ﬁrst place score in the
discus throw.

In the shot put, Bill Benghauser

came home the victor by putting the
shot 45 feet 6% inches, beating out
Kraft, Army veteran, and team-
mate Ted Konetsky.

Pole Vault Disappointing

The pole vault event showed Pitt’s
biggest disappointment of the aft-
ernoon for Rhoades and Jessup,
two of the nation’s best, failed to
hit 12 feet 6 inches, and had to be
content with a tie for fourth.

Army thinclads showed a much
ﬁner team than was expected, but
the all-around team of Pitt were
'proven superior. The Cadet’s main
strength lie in the ﬁeld events,
while the Panthers were much too
powerful in the dashes and the
middle distances.

 Ceramics Exhibit
 Attracts Comments

The ﬁrst showing of work done
iibx students in the ceramics de-
 partment of the University is now
{on View on the 30th ﬂoor of the
33 Cathedral of Learning. It is also
»,the ﬁrst exhibit of a wide variety
"of Pittsburgh-made ceramics.

Included are more than 150 pieces
Iof porcelain, stoneware, terra cotta,
decorated tile, and ceramic sculp-
"ture. Many techniques were em-
‘ployed and many types of glazes.
In general, emphasis is placed on
high temperature ware as being
..best adapted to precision work-
‘manship. .

‘f “The show achieves distinction
because of its high quality model-
ing and design,” according to Lu-
fcille Cox, of East Liverpool, Ohio,
nationally known writer on cera-
imics. “Joseph Palin Thorley’s pu-
pils are making a deﬁnite contribu-
tion to American pottery because
they are producing a type of ware
that has long been sought for, a

gurely American type. Mr. Thor-
13:'¢y’s own work is outstanding.

_His pupils are doing a marvelous
job.”

Baldwin, Finney
Write Works

“The Keelboat Age on Western
Waters.” by Dr. Leland D. Baldwin,
University librarian and lecturer in
history, was published by the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh press last
week.

This book, the tenth of a series
on Western Pennsylvania history,
was written under the direction of
the Western Pennsylvania Historic-
al survey and sponsored jointly by
the Buhl foundation, the Historical
Society of Western Pennsylvania,
and the University.

Dr. Baldwin has written three
other books: “Pittsburgh: the Story
of a City,” “Whiskey Rebels: the
Story of a Frontier Uprising,” and
“The Delectable Country,” a best-
selling novel based . on Western
Pennsylvania history.

The new book of the University
librarian is a story of river boating
in the West before the invention of
the steamboat, and relates episodes
involving river pirates and the haz-
ards of early travel. A

Sixteen pages of contemporary
art illustrate the text. Decorative
chapter headings are by Harvey
Cushman, Pittsburgh artist.

Theodore M. Finney, associate
professor’ and head of the music ap-
preciation department, has pub-
lished a new book on the apprecia-
tion ofmusic, it was announced to-
day. The title of the book is
“Hearing Music.”

Intended not only as a text for
students, but as a means of helping

‘others to understand and appreci-

ate music, the work has for its
subject “what is commonly called
the appreciation of music.” '

In ‘tlie’ ﬁrfst chapter Mr. Finney
writes, “It will suggest to many
who have been listening to ‘music
all their lives that there is a better

way to listen.”

The book is not Mr. Finney’s ﬁrst
contribution to .»the literary ﬁeld.
He is the author of a standard text
on the history of music which is
used widely in schools throughout
the country.

He also has written and edited
articles on the subject of music, and
is the editor of “Music Teaching,”
publication of the Music Teachers
National association proceedings.

Sponsor Summer
Flying, Course

In cooperation with the Civil
Aeronautics Authority, the Univer-
s=,ty..wl1l offer a special two-month
ﬂying course this summer, provid-
ing enough interested students ap-
ply for the course, David Summer-
ville, instructor in mechanical en-
gineering and coordinator of the
course, announced today.

The course, open to all male stu-
dents of sophomore standing or
higher will be conducted from July
1 through September 15, according
to Summerville.

Those interested should leave
their name and address with the
registrar immediately, in order that
the number taking the course may
be determined soon enough to com-
plete arrangements with the CAA.

Applicants must be over 19 years
of age, in sound ‘physical health, and
present a satisfactory scholastic rec-
ord, declared Summerville.

District Business
Increases Again

Rebounding from the business lag
caused by the coal stoppage of last
April, the volume . of Pittsburgh
district business activity climbed
close; to the record high reached
earlier this year, according’ to Pitt’s
Bureau of Business Research.

Recovery in industrial production
is responsible‘ fol” the increased ac-
tivity, and consequently another
production setback, occasioned by a
threatened stoppage, would again
plunge business to an unnatural
low. The high rate of coal con-
sumption has prevented the replen-
ishing of coal stocks vital to indus-
trial operation.

Coupled with the recent business
spurt was a slight decline in trade
activity.

Pitt Players Sponsor
Marionette Show

For the beneﬁt ofthose who
have never seen the opera, “Sieg-
freid,” Pitt Players are_sponsoring
a marionette show of the opera
Thursday evening at 8:30 o’clock in

Musical background for the show
will be Richard Wagner’s “Sieg-
freid’s Idyl1.” The puppets are the
property of Frank Mason, technical
director of Players. Admission is
free, and anyone may attend, in-
vites William McElwain, C41, presi-
dent.

Continued from page one
than six months, due to pressing
business affairs.

The problem of ﬁnding a quali-
ﬁed person for the post has been
long-standing with Mayor Corne-
lius D. Scully and the city council.
The council had hoped that Dr.
Williams would ﬁll the post, and
recently raised the superintendent's
salary from $2,400 to $4,200 a year.

Dr. Williams’ illness is a recur-
rent jungle malady which he con-
tracted several years ago on a trip
into the jungles of Haiti.

He has been on the University
faculty for 15 years, and is a mem-
ber of Omicron Delta Kappa, Col-
lembolae, and Sigma Xi.

Air Hostess Jobs '
Await Applicants,
Texas Letter Says

_ An l air hostess job, the secret
dream of almost every short. girl,
is actually going begging for ap-
plicants! We never thought to see
the day when an airways company
would write to say, “Won’t you
please come to Texas and be our air
hostesses?” But, according to M. A.
deVitis, associate professor of mod-
ern languages, it has happened.

A letter received from Love Field
in Dallas, Texas, stated that appli-
cations of girls who could speak
Spanish, had at least two years of
college, were 21 to 26 years of
age, and weighed 100 to 118
pounds, were wanted for the posi-
tions.

Additional requirements were
unquestionable family background,
irreproachable character, pleasant
personality, and ability to deal with
people. A

Lineup, girls, no hair-pulling,-and

ninth ﬂoor. ‘
