PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA, WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 12, 1938

hi the last few weeks, a rein-
carnation oi’ an old plan to limit.
the niembersliip of womt-.11’s so-
cial t‘raternit.ies has appeared
on the Universit_v canipus.

At: various intervals tl1rou;2:li-
out the past decade attempts have
been made to put the plan into ef-

fect here, but all efforts have
failed’ consistently. Now the Na-
tional Panhellenic Congress is

making its first official move in an
attempt to have their plan ap-
proved and adopted immediately
by women’s fraternities all over
the country.

Letters explaining the reorgan-
ization were sent to fraternity

has been presented and discussed
at meetings of the local chapters.

Now the question is pending,
“Will the plan be accepted and
put into effect here?” Pros and
cons are being tossed around pro-
miscuoizsly, and the answer has
not yet been foimd.

Objective View

Perhaps if? fraternity women
would take a little time to look
objectively at the present condi-
tions of the local chapters therei
vzoulrf. be no question about ac-
cepting tor l‘€_'l€(.'ll,l’.1g) the NFC
proposal.

A chart listing the comparative
sizes of local women’s ‘fraternities’
for this semester shows that indi-
vidual s~iir'(sllir.c-iits vary irom 40.
to 5.
hers and pledges.

No elucidation is needed to show
that in the larger groups there is
little "fraternalization” in its true‘
sense; that excellent opportunity}
is offered for those groups to split:
up into cliques which eventually’
will create an apathetic attitude
among its members. At that point,
the appellation “t'raternity” be-
comes a misnomer.

The 1:-resent trend of the smaller
groups to decrease in prestige and
m.ember.ship will, obviously, result
in spontaneous disintegratitm of
the l'i‘at.eriiity. unless, by limiting
the number of women who may be
pledged by the present larger
groups, they are given an opportu-
nity to enlarge thernsclves. Under
the NPC plan the small l'rat.erni_-g
ties would be given this opportu- ‘,
nity. 

Quotas Set it

As suggested by the Congress,;
chapter size would be determined,’
by the number of women enrolled 3
at a given college. For schools of
less than 300 women, a quota of
25 members and pledges would be
set; for schools of between 300 and
1000 women, 35 members and
pledges; for schools of over 1000
women, 50 members and pledges.

Although members of the larger
fraternities may not like the idea
of decreasing their membership,
it will be to their advantage that-’
a quota be set to keep their groups
from becoming mass meetings and

‘to regain the qualities that their
name implies.

An extract from a letter to col—;
lege Panhellenics from the Na-l
tional Panhellenic Congress ex-
presses the opinion that “All NPC
fraternities stand unanimous in be-
lieving in the principle of limita-
tion of chapter size and we are
asking you to work out on your
campus what seems best to you,
using our committee on Panhellen-
ics for help, guidance, and tact
supplying.” .

If women at the University want 
a strong fraternity system, it will,‘
be only by remedying the defi-
ciencies of the local chapters
through adoption of the NPC pro-_
posal.

‘Survey’
Editorial
Answered

Dr. Charlesworth
Says Committee
Welcoines Advice

ln answer to an editorial
printed in .\‘[onda_v’s' issue of
The News, “'l‘lic l.’assi1ig' of a
Lantlmark," Dr. Jaincs C.
C-liarlcswortli, associate. pro-
fessor of political science, cl_iair-
man of the mu-riculum. c(mm1it—
tee, revealed totlay the reasons
for the removal of the Survey
Course from the curriculum.

The course, offered to students
in the college and composed almost
entirely of freshmen, was intended
to present survey material in the
ﬁelds of science. social science, and
fine arts.

ENGLISH COURSE

The section in Survey of Englisli
was the required Freshman Com-
position, under the direc‘-.'ion of the

head of the d.epa.rtment, Professor"
I Percival Hunt.

Tracing‘ the previous status of

the Survey division, Dr. Ch:i1'les-‘

v».roi'tli said: _

“Departments at the University
enjoy a high degree of depart-
mental autonomy. Due to this
condition, the administration of
the Survey Course was decentral-
ized, and each depa.1'tment repre-
sented in the sub-division of the
course handled its work as it saw
fit.

SCIENCE EXCEPTION

“Whether  a result of convic—;
tion or of the press 01' other duties ,

of the faculty members, the indi-
vidual courses became indistin-
guishable from the ordinary basic

course in the several departlnents.” ‘

According to Dr. Charlesworth,
this condition did not hold true in
the science field, where a special
course was devised. This course,
however, was discontinued at the

year.

scuomuzs’ DAY COMMITTEE l A M 

By ROBERT BROWN

During the recent meetings of
the American Musical Teachers’
convention, Theodore" M. Finney,
director of instrumental activities
at the University, disclosed his
discovery of a Moravian musical
manuscript that may, in time, be
rated as one of the most important

lﬁnds ever made by an American

musicologist.

Mr. Finney first heard of the
collection approximately two years
ago, although its existence had
been surmised in several Ameri-
can books on the subject of native
music. ‘

NOTED IN JOURNAL
An old Philadelphia journal was

the first to note the little town of

Lititz in Lancaster county, and
mentioned especially “an elegant
little church with a steeple and
bell” where the whole collection

of manuscripts were located. The

music evidently had been undis-

turbed since the Civil War.

many began in 1734, and a settle- ‘

The University women will up-

and others equally well known in
Europe.‘ Mr. Finney regards Peter
as the greatest of these men. Peter
traveled all over the South, ﬁlling
demands for his compositions, and
it is amusing to note, that, because
he was a viola player, he gave
many “juicy” parts to the “bach—
elor of the instruments.”
ANTHEM LIBRARY

“The anthem library at Lititz
represents 294 works by 50 com-
posers,” states Mr. Finney’s paper.
“Even though the Moravian mu-
sicians themselves account for a
large part of this catalogue, the
Works of many Well known com-
posers of Europe were known and
used in the services and remain at
present in the library.”

and his pucksters hit the ice fig-
uratively and literally according
to a notice posted by Joel Bennett,
team manager. ‘Vlonday afternoon.

Changes in practice schedules
enable the ice squad to get a ses-

tomorrow Johnny Harris’ arena‘ on 3

workout on Silver Lake‘. '. S ‘=
This fortunate arrangement. of;
practice sessions is just what Mc— 
Sorley has been hoping for and he;
intends to take advantage of every 1;
opportunity to get in a good daily-3

Warsity Sluggers Meet

W&J Boxers Saturday

Proxies Provide

First Real Test

For Panthers

By JACK MITCHELL

Three more days, and the
Pitt. varsity sluggers will meet
a. liigiily touted W & J boxing

contingent in the initial slug-
fest tourney of the 1938 season.

Captained by “ lattlin’ Bill"

coaclied by a former profes-
sional luminary, George Tucker,
the Little Washington aggregation
will let loose both barrels in hope

of starting the year in the win col— 5

umn, and breaking a losing streak

‘which seemed to haunt them alli

last season.

Coach Tucker, sporting a couple
of seasoned veterans, feels that his
boys‘, will make the going tough for

all opposition,‘and is looking for- 

wardto a somewhat better season.
PITT HAS VETS
.The Panther mittmen, however,

are not to be taken lightly. Every I
weight division, except the heavy, 4

is ‘represented by at least one hold-

over from last year’s team. The:
heavyweight class will be repre-E

sented by Critchfleld, a 207 pound-
er. “Lupey” Luppinacci,

ing middleweight is limping
around on a bum leg, but Neuner,

to ﬁll in.

Curzi, winner of last year’s in-
tramural slugfest, is favored to get
the starting nod over Lynch and

mathematicians, scholars, ‘writers, musicians, and
composers. In Russia she and her husband were
wealthy. “Of course,” she said, “we were not :1
wealthy as some of the American families here,
but still we were well-to-do. We were not allow-
ed to take any of our wealth out of Russia during
the revolution.”

C

.;Separation of the Ways
Up to the time of the revolution her husband, :1
 mechanical engineer, had never done any real work.

lfeducated, but,” she shrugged her shoulders, “I don’t
iknow why; they never applied their learning.”

: Shortly after the revolution startc-d, she and her
 husband went different ways, she with her two chil-
‘Idren. and he alone to try to make :1 living. They
idid not meet again until ten years later here 
S America.

In speaking of her experiences during this time
;l\/Ire. Karassin said, “My experiences are :20 little
3,co1nparcd to the big thing that happened in Russia
 that I do not consider them important. But people,
lwhen I give lectures, would rather hear about my
Siexperiences than about the causes of the revolution
 or the conditions in the country.’

In 1919 she went from the Prince Islands, near
§Rus:~:ia, where she had fled from the revolution to
ilstanbul in Turkey. She taught there, wrote arti-
lclcs for English papers, and worked as :1 journalist
ldoing reasearch work until 1924. In reference to
{this work she said, “Journal.ism is :1 work that en-
jslaves you entirely. Often I averaged 20 hours a

Addenda To The
Passing Landmark
N AN interview on the ﬁ1?st page ’roda.v, am-

I swer is given to the editorial p1'i11’te<l in
l\’lo11da.y's issue.

The editorial referred to, “The Passing of 3.
La.ndma.rk,” objected to the removal of the
Survey (‘loursc in the l,711iv<*.rsit_\' cu'rricul\11u. lf
agreetl with the contention that the course, by
inade<p1at.e supervision and co11t.ent, had be-
come defunct. in purpose long before the com-
mittee~l1.'ad declared it defunct‘ in name.

The statements indicate that the course, by
its original purpose, was not unnecessary, but
the course by its adlninistration had become ob-
solescent.

This brings to mind that proposals for change.
in course instruction buck up against the seri-
ous obstacl.e that there is an overburdening of
faculty members at the University. This over-
b11I'del1l1l.g.;' makes it liecessary for many “good
ideas” to be dismissed.

Thdrc are not eu_§pugl1 professors to handle

the courses, and those who are assigned to han— 9

die new material usually ﬁnd themselves so
overwhelmed by the mass of details that a
proper handling of their classes is impossible.
These problems are again brought to bear with
the disposition of the Survey Course.

VVe have already suggested a plan for the or-
ganization of the course, based upon the orig-
inal proposition of a general cultura.1 education
designed to acqiiaint the student‘ with many
ﬁelds of liberal arts material.

But our proposal, it seems, will go by the
board unless the curriculum committee man-
ages to ﬁnd faculty persons who are able and
have sufficient time to coordinate the subjects
to be presented.

The previous diﬁiculty has been lack of ad-
ministrative organization. Administrators
need time in .f5vhich’t0 administrate. Time, is
difficult toﬁnd, when the potential administra-
tor, Whomsoever he may be, is weighted down
by seven and eight courses per week.

It is a. question whether to submit plans for
new courses when old courses need more atten-
tion. But we would remind the committee that
the Survey Course, as proposed, has never ex-
isted. Vi-'e would suggest that it be given a try.

Note Of Condolence

INCERE condolence and the sympathy of
the entire Pitt. News stat? are extended. to-
day to Herbert Ra.ckoﬂ:', C38, whose mother
died late lilonday afternoon at New Kensing-
$011.

Rackoit, honor student‘ and member of Pi
Tau Phi, honorary scholastic fraternity, and
Omicron Delta Kappa, activities honorary, is
managing editor of The News.

; Turkish intelligence service also.
 is a consul in Europe today.

 Mrs. Karassih mentioned an incident ‘that took
 place when the Central Powers submitted their con-

iditions of surrender to the Allies and the term were

One of her pupils

irefused. She said, “A Turk, one of my pupils said '

gto me, ‘One nation should not try to crush another
lunless it can annihilate them entirely. Otherwise,
iwhen the nation again gathers enough strength, they
5 will rise up in revenge. That is the way we treated
the Armenians; we even cut the throats of the
children so that there would be none left to have
revenge.’ ”

She mentioned the same thing to an English in-
telligence ofﬁcer in regard to Germany. “He said
to me,” she continued, “ ‘You are French, that is the
reason you feel that way about Germany. ’ ‘No,’ I.
said, ‘remember what Cara says’-——Cara was my pen
name———‘After the Germans get enough strength, they
will stop paying to the Allies.’ I can not remember
the name of the officer, but wherever he is, I think
he knows now I was right.”

In 1924 she went to Paris where she remained
until 1928. During this time she worked under Paul
Milioukov, a professor and political writer from
Moscow, and a member of the Constitutional Demo-
cratic party, who was working in the foreign de-
partment of the Provisional Government. Today he
is the editor of a Paris newspaper, “The Latest
News.”

To America In 1928

She left Paris for the United States in 1928 be-
cause she had been very ill and was under a doctor’s
orders to leave the city.

As to the revolution and Russia, she said, “Unless
you have been to Russia, you can not know what
Russia was or is. I do not think Russia has gained
anything from the revolution. They killed, they
destroyed too many scientists, too many artists, too
many men who could have helped the country. Per-
haps in 25 years there will be gain, not now.”

Her ﬁrst impression of America was not a favor-
able one. When she arrived in 1928, she sensed a
tension about the country which reminded her of
the lull before the storm. She thought the prosper-
ity was too good to be true. It was not long after
that the storm broke in a depression.

“It seemed to me,” she said, “that the American
people were selling their birthright for nothing.”
But she feels that the depression has changed all
that.

She has found in America a lack of the culture
that is so much a part of Europe. ’ “You have it in
places,” she said, “in oases here and-there, but not
to the extent that it is to be found in Europe. You
may have it after many years; I believe you will.
But America is so young yet.”

In addition to this, Mrs. Karassih feels that there
is too much standardization in America. “You have
rows of houses here that look alike. And the peo-
ple in them dress alike and think alike and look
alike. In Europe the houses are not alike. And the
people, each has his own characteristics.”

Drunk, Stewed, Plastered?

Question for quibble: When is a man drunk?

«;the two kittens had repeatedly

; a typical “reversion to a lower or-
ldcr habit,”—-typical, because the
fsvaine type of reversion is often
found in human neurotics.

The most famous case of experi-
mentally-inducecl neurosis was re-
ported by the Russian physiologist,

Pavlov. His. was a dog which suf-
fered a complete nervous break-
down. when forced to distinguish
between a circle and an almost
circular ellipse. Recently, at the
American Psychiatric Society’s
convention, .a paper was read on a
similarly “neurotic pig.”
Psychologists are tending to look
to experiments with lower animals
for new light on human insanity,
and already have found a parallel
between it and animals’ neuroses.
They believe the strain 01:‘ making
ﬁne distinctions, and deﬁnite de-
cisions in a complex situation are
responsible for nervous break-
down in humans and animals.
MONKEYS PROFICIENT
Dr. Karn’s experiment is in-
tended to Show the evolutionary
development oi’ symbolic thinking,
which is believed to be the psycho-
logical basis of human speech.
Monkeys are the most proficient of
the lower animals in symbolic

thinking. Racoons are next, com-
}ing higher in the scale than kittens,
lwhile rats are the least proficient.
 The results oi‘ this experiment
, have been accepted for publication
lby the Journal of Comparative
 Psychology.
