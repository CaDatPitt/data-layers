work to end noisy parties

By Suzann Gries
sums Writer

The South Oakland Citizens Council
will be taking serious measures to stop the
partying in South Oakland, according to
SOCC executive director Pat Scanlon.

“There is certainly a serious problem
here. People are placed in danger by
irresponsible and unnecessary behavior
on the street,” Scanlon said.

Scanlon believes there is a classic “boy
who cried wolf’ situation going in South
Oakland. There is a “phenomenon of
students in South Oakland who walk
down the street and scream and think this
is funny,” she said.

She said she used to look out the
window to see what was happening when
people scream, but now she no longer
bothers to see what the problem is. ,

“Students have the attitude that they
have the right to party, and they do, but
not if everyone around them has to be
included in their parties, too. I think this is

the message students haven’t gotten yet,”.

Scanlon gaid. ,

Scanlon attributes the problem to the
students’ “horrendous” behavior and a
lack of commitment to the community.
She accused the students of having no
respect for property.

But some students don’t think there is a

problem.

“I mean this is a college campus. This
isn’t an old folks’ home. I can see if parties
get out of control at a certain time or
something, but they should understand
this is a college campus and there is going
to be parties, “said Pitt student Tim
Schaeffer, a Bates Hill Apartment resident.

Pitt student Jeff Condran said students
in South Oakland should be held
accountable for their actions just as other
residents of the city are.

“I really don’t think that South Oakland
is the university’s campus. It’s just like any
other residential community. If we break
the law, then we break the law,” Condran
said. '

“There’s a lot of old people on this
block, on Oakland Avenue. Our neighbor,
he’s kind of a hard guy, he gets upset
aboutkids in the neighborhood. On a few
occasions it gets loud, but I don’t think it’s
a problem,” said Brian Volkart, a Pitt
student.

Scanlon described several incidents in
South Oakland.

“At a party on Atwood Street once, a
boy was thrown out of a party, and he

came back and set fire to the place. There’
is a family with kids who lives right next '

door.” '
Scanlon has observed many of the

Saunders representative
on Pitt budget committee

By Jenna Ferrara
News Editor

Pitt President J. Dennis O’Connor
appointed exiting Student Government
Board President Brent Saunders as the
only student representative on a
committee to form theiuniversity budget.

At a Board of Trustees meeting in
November O’Connor had announced
that faculty, staff and students would
take part in the budget process for the
first time. The trustees and administration
had previously formulated the budget
with “little input” from other areas of
the university, O’Connor said.

The new committee for fiscal year
1995 is scheduled to meet in a few

. weeks, Saunders said.’

Also on the committee are Provost
Donald Henderson, Staff Association
Council President Joanne Rosol,
University Senate President Richard
Tobias, senate budget—policies
committee Chair Edward Symons, and
interim senior vice presidents for

business and finance Jeffrey Romoff

and Robert Dunkelman.

Saunders said he was chosen because
he has been following the budget
process closely for months and
O’Connor needed to make an

appointment quickly.

“I think I have a feel for what students
are looking for,” Saunders said. “I hope
to make sure more money goes to ‘
undergraduate programs, [which are]
often left out behind medicine and
science.”

Saunders had requested that a student
be involved in the new budget process.
A new student will succeed Saunders in
spring 1992, when the committee
finishes its work. Saunders said
he plans to include the input ofstudent
groups such as the engineering and
nursing student cabinets when he meets
with the committee.

But opening the budget process to
new areas of the university could also
create tension, Saunders said.

“Some of the people on the committee
are faculty. It’s going to be interesting to
see faculty approve money for other
academic areas. There may be problems
between faculty members,” he said.

Concerning the end of his SGB term,
Saunders has mixed emotions.

“It was hard to please everybody 
But. it was definitely a rewarding
experiencepl would do it again.”

He said the key to the SGB presidency
is “telling everyone what you’re doing.
Keep everything public.”

BAS urges end to ‘black on black’ violence

 

By Jim Donlon
Staﬂ’ Writer

The Black Action Society has
started a program to deter black-
on—black violence on the
University of Pittsburgh campus.

It recently held the first in what
will be a series of‘ meetings
between various black student
organizations.

Letters were sent to a number
of black organizations on campus,
inviting them to meet and discuss
recent violence, according to BAS
political action Chair Darryl Wiley.

There have been at least five or
six incidents of black—on—black

violence on campus since the A

beginning of the term, including
two severe‘ beatings and one

The recession is shrinking the job market for new
graduates, but for people graduating from Pitt this
year, a job may be found in their own backyard at
the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center.

Health care has had a robust growth throughout
the economy’s downturn, according to government

statistics on employment rates.

“Anyone in [Pitt’s health-sciences schools] can
pick where they want to work and there's going to

said.

“At this campus there are only
about 1,400 Afro-American
students. I think it is important
that we not take on that kind of
behavior when we are such a
small group. It can be nothing
but detrimental to us,” Wiley said.

Twenty-five people attended
the first meeting, according to
Wiley.

Wiley said there are no concrete

"ways to stop the violence but

some ideas were raised at the
meeting. ~ - I

“To change the mentality about
fighting we need to talk to the
students,” Wiley said.

He said that some suggestions
were to have a dialogue with
students about the necessity of
stopping the fights.

Students could also "talk to the

positions.

people who have caused the
problems and tell them about the
detrimental effect it has on the
African—American student
population as a whole, he said.
“It’s not the majority who are
causing these problems_. It’s a
very minute few. We’re not going
to sacrifice the many for the few,”
Wiley said. -
There have been
announcements at different Black
Week events stressing respect of
others and the need for unity.
Wiley said that in the future
there could also be lectures by

. Pitt faculty members to stress the

point.

“The meetings are going to
continue,” he said, adding that
communication must continue
whether or not the violence
continues.

“Everything that you would have in a major
corporation you will have in health care. Business,

finance, marketing, law —- all of that makes up
what we do,” Lang said.

The UPMC advertises its professional positions in
daily newspapers and on employment boards
within the hospital and at the Nese-Barkan building.
There are approximately 13,000 employees within

the medical center.

CAS assistant solves student problems

By Scott Nespor
For T be Pitt News

At the end of the semester, the
College of Arts and Sciences
dean’s office is usually filled with
students looking for graduation
applications, checking their files
or trying to evade general-
education requirements.

One of the staff members who
helps these confused students is
Barbara Mellix.

As an assistant to the dean, her
duties are varied. She is in charge
of admitting international and
internal transfer students to CAS.
She can help someone custom-
design a major. She edits the CA5
magazine Venture.

But as CAS’s newest dean, she
said one of her most important
tasks is to help students
“personalize their experience at
Pitt.”

Mellix was also once a_ Pitt
student, earning bachelor's and
master’s of fine arts degrees in

b English writing.

When she went to school, she
thought the dean’s office was
“where problem people go” and
avoided it. But Mellix said she
wishes she knew then what she
knows now.

She once lost a term’s tuition
when her youngest daughter
broke her leg early in the term,
and Mellix thought that Pitt would
not refund her money. It is ‘a
mistake that she regrets “to this

day.”

Now she hopes to put the past
behind her, and wants students
to know the dean’s office is there
to help them. She likes to help
“frustrated students who have no
idea about what they want to
do.”

As a professor in Pitt’s summer
supplemental STEP program, she
sees many first—year students who
are scared of Pitt’s urban setting.
She also works with international
students who at first “look so
frightened, that ifyou touch their
shoulder, they will jump.”

But helping them get used to
Pitt is one of the more enjoyable
aspects of her job. _“It is a good
feeling when you see them on
the street, and they appear to be
very well-adjusted,” Mellix said.

She grew up on her family’s
cotton and tobacco farm in South
Carolina, one of 11 children who
lived in a four—room house that
her father and neighbors built in
one weekend.

Although she knew she would
miss her family and the house

with its tin roof, she “wanted to
get off that farm so bad — and
wanted to get to the city.”

After getting married and having
two daughters, she started to
pursue an education at Pitt. For
her, getting good grades was like
“having a long drink ofcold water
on a hot day.”

i\lellix"s parents taught her to
be proud ofherselfand everything
she does. \\'v’hen she was a child,
she had to step off the sidewalk
whenever a white person walked
by. Once she asked her parents
why this was so and why she
went to a different school than
white children.

She learned to adjust to living
in a segregated society because
of her family’s support. Her
mother told her to “keep her
head high,” and to this day people
comment about her “high head”
and her pride and love of life.

Pitt is a good school forAfrican-
American students, because
unlike an all—black school, it
closely resembles life in the “real

employer will look for is any
kind of work experience. I think
what you study in school and
what really happens in the
workplace are two different
things,” she said.

“We need more creative people
all the Lime because, as health-
care costs rise and reimbursement
becomes smaller and smaller, you
need to balance that and come
up with innovative ways without
sacriﬁcing patient care,” Lang said.

Experience is one qualification
that many graduates can‘t fulfill.
But there are ways that people
can meet this requirement.

“One of the main things I would
recommend to anyone still in
school is do internships or even
take a clerical position in the area
you want to go into,” Lang said.

Another way to gain experience
is through volunteering, which
can allow a person to try out the
field they like without risk.

Taking entry-level positions can
pay off for graduates and
undergraduates because the
experience is beneficial and the
medical center offers good
benefits, she said.

“If people are interested in
graduate school, our tuition-
reimbursement benefits are

fantastic,” Lang said.

“Even undergraduates can get
reimbursed plus find employment
that pays an excellent wage
compared to anything else,” she
said.

Reimbursement is typically six
credits for full-time employees
and three credits for part time.

Lang looks for employees who
are well-rounded. “Grades aren’t
everything. I would rather have
someone with a 2.5 [quality-point
average] that worked part—time
and was involved in some activity,
than someone with a 4.0 who did
nothing but study all the time.

this person is organized and can

she said.

“Employees are also given
opportunities to develop their
skills through programs
sponsored by the UPMC. We offer
career development workshops

how to interview, how to improve
image, and things employers look
for. Hopefully, that employer

Remember the promises you
made to yourself in the beginning
of the semester: read all
assignments, form study groups,
study every day, complete
assignments early, continue to
work, maintain your social life
and never miss a class.

Well, somehow those days ﬂew
by and the most dreaded time in

' college life is near —finals week!

In preparation for finals, you
realize that you need to read 10
to 12 chapters of assigned
readings and memorize pages
upon pages of notes for each
class.

If that’s not bad enough -— all
your papers and tests are due the
same day!

Stress is not something that can

be deferred until you finish your

classes because you are a student.
It must and will be experienced
throughout the college years.
All students face a number of
personal and social adjustments,
as well as high expectations. The

these symptoms of stress are more
pronounced during this time
period.

The word “stress” is derived

“tightness” continues, it can be

CGS offers prisoners college education

a By Sandy Lasswell

Staff Writer

“Never in my wildest dreams
did I believe Iwould get a college
degree,” said Richard, who has
been out of prison for only a few
months.

Fiore Pugliano, who
coordinated the Pitt program that
helped Richard get an education,
describes the students as “excited,
challenged and committed.”

Several prison inmates have
turned their lives around by
attending college behind bars
through Pitt’s program at the State
Correctional Institution at
Pittsburgh.

“I’m on a whole different path
than I was before,” said john,
who was paroled late in

September. John and Richard ‘

requested that their last names
not be used.

“The students are very
motivated, very interested. They
ask a lot of questions,” said

Professor Laverne Rocereto, who

teaches anthropology.

“l have seen people change,”
Pugliano said. He described one
man who was sullen and
withdrawn when -he was
practically dragged into the
program.

‘‘I le has been transformed. llis
attitude is much more open, and
he wants to finish his degree,"
Pugliano said.

Without education “one could
pretty much guarantee that many

* '- of these" peop'l'e~wouldv be»

supported by the state the rest of

their lives,” Pugliano said.
Studies have shown that the

rate of offenders returning to

prison goes down as the level of
education goes up. One year
after parole over 30 percent of
offenders with less than a college
education have returned to prison.
Of college graduates, only 11
percent have gone back to prison.

Richard explains it this way: “If
people are monsters when they
go in there, without help they
will be bigger monsters when
they get out.”

“They train inmates to come
back,” he said. “Many of these
guys never learned to accept
responsibility. In prison
somebody else is running your
life for you. You are‘ provided
with a warm place to stay and
three meals a day.”

“Three hots and a cot,” John
described it.

Most of the 120 to 150 students
who take college courses each
term are learning totake on
responsibility as well as a new
way of thinking. About a fourth
of the inmate-students take a full
load. They often combine External
Studies courses with those taught
on site by volunteer faculty.

“The students themselves have
helped to keep the program
goin"g,” Pugliano said.

t‘7’S'<5,¥f1,*c~§~",¥ir;ir'r’ia.te'sr who have '

completed their education tutor
students and teach basic courses.
Inmate john Minarik teaches a
poetry writing course and expects
his students to submit their work
for publication

More than 40 students have

graduated while in prison, some

with honors. One was a
Chancellor’s Scholar. Each year a
graduation ceremony is held,
which includes those prisoners

who have completed general-
education diplomas and
vocational training courses as well
as bachelor’s degrees.

A party afterward allows
graduates to celebrate their ac-
complishments along with family
and friends.

“It’s a great reward for me to
see the happiness on the faces of
the parents and other family
members who are so proud of
these men,” Rocereto said.

Donna Williams, one of the
advisers with the program, re-
called a mother with tears in her
eyes who thanked her personally.

Some students leave prison
before graduating and continue
their studies on the outside. John
and Richard are both now
studying on the Pitt campus.

John expects to graduate with
a major in information science in
August 1992, and Richard looks
forward to completing his degree
in communications in December
that same year.

Both expressed gratitude for
the support they have received
from people like Robin Wingard

of the University External Studies V

Program office and Pu gliano, who

have helped them make the _
adjustment to taking cl-asses on A

campus. I

“I feel I belong. I’m a card
carrying member of the
university,” John said.

Richard who comes from a
Philadelphia ghetto where drugs
and gang wars were a natural
part of life, saidthe was
encouraged to get his GED in
prison and was motivated to go
on.

He said he can't understand

why more prisoners don’t take
advantage of the program.

“Guys should be breaking '

down the doors to get in," he
said. “Most of the guys are like in
a graveyard. They are just dying
—— wasting away. I'd like to help
them. Be an example. I’ll never
stop learning.”

Richard gives credit to the
prison tutoring service for part of
his success. “Algebra gave me
the blues,” he said. “Robert
Wideman [an inmate instructor]
gave me a lot of help.” _

John explained that when the
Pitt advisers come to the prison,
it’s a big event for the men. “We
always get a large turnout,” he
said. “The men feel these people
care about them."

“The men seem surprised that
anyone wants to help,” Robin
Wingard said. “They appreciate
the fact that people donate their
time to teach and that students
are willing to donate study
guides.”

Wingard said that because they
lack money for books, some of
the men have had to drop courses
they wanted. The UESP ofﬁce
has made available to the
prisoners over 200 student-
donated study guides for UESP
courses.

In addition to textbooks, the
program is also in constant need
of more teachers.

Richard speculated that some
teachers may be afraid to go to
the prison. “The guys protect the

I teachers. They aren’t going to let

anyone treat_ them with
disrespect,” he said.

Pugliano said the dedication of
the instructors and of the students
themselves has been the biggest
factor in making the program a
success. '

Richard knows. “I always
wanted something better. Now

I’m doing fine,” he said with a

grin.

Education president

President George Bush has once again shown his
disdain for affirmative action, and this time it could affect
higher-education funds for minority students.

Proposed by Assistant Secretary of Education Michael
Williams and honed by the White House, a measure is in
the works that would prohibit colleges from granting
scholarships based on race.

Officials said the move would not deprive any minority
student of a scholarship “from a practical standpoint.”
Schools could still issue scholarships to create “diversity,”
but these scholarships would have to be open to any
student.

This type of policy is typical of the Bush administration,
which consistently inflicts long-term harm to satisfy the
conservative right.

Rallying around mythical cries of reverse discrimination,
the administration is turning its head from the advantages
of these scholarships and ignoring the benefits that these
programs create. _

Scholarships of this kind allow college administrators to
bring minority students to traditionally white campuses,
allowing all the students to beneﬁt from the multiculturalism
that results. ' , ’

Stories are written about the lack of minorities on
campus in student, faculty and administrative roles; The
only way to increase these numbers and improve the
situation is to increase the number of minorities that
attend and graduate from college.

Scholarships like the type in question aid colleges and,
more importantly, the students by providing incentives
and avenues to their entering college.

A higher-education spokesperson echoed the uncertainty
that some minorities might have when applying for
scholarships, stating in The Pittsburgh Press, “I find it awfully
confusing, and once again it sends a wrong message.
What it’s telling minority students is it’s a crapshoot.
Basically, you’re going to be thrown in with everybody
else.” _

In reality, the minority students who receive these
scholarships only comprise three percent of the country’s
total college enrollment. _

This small percentage, though, allows 35,000 minorities
to finance their college education. As America heads
toward the 21st century, when whites will no longer
comprise the majority, it is more important that a rise in
the number of minorities attending and graduating from
college becomes crucial.

Education is the key to the future of America, and for the
“education president” to make it more difficult for a
segment of the population to fund college is not only
ridiculous — it’s uneducated.

Christmas feeling Inissing

“People laughing, people
passing, dressed in holiday style,
in the air there’s a feeling of 
Christmas? Where? Does this
feeling exist anymore or is it just

Chrissy
Cortazzo

Does anyone else feel that
Christmas has become way too
commercialized?

Over Thanksgiving I went to
Monroeville Mall to look around,

a ﬁgment of our imaginations? A
sick delusion of times past maybe? Or is it just a
pitiful reminder of a time when people actually had
a glimmer of love in their hearts?

The Christmas season is fast approaching. As a
matter of fact, we only have 21 shopping days left
until the big day, when Santa fulfills everyone’s
dreams of Christmas grandeur. On this day millions
of people will cover their living room ﬂoors with
tons of discarded wrapping paper, miles of ribbon
and enough bows to fill Pitt and Carnegie Mellon’s
combined football stadiums. —

When I look back at my childhood, I can say it
was wonderful. And Christmas? Well, that was just
the icing on the cake. When I think of the Christmases
I had as a child, I remember the parties we always
had and still have on Christmas Eve.

My family celebrates this day in traditional Italian
standards by having a huge foodfest. This is the
night that friends and loved ones all converge on
my household to eat, drink and be merry. Everyone
gets really dressed up, and then I go to midnight
mass with my friends. I look forward to Dec. 24
from Christmas Day on.

When I grew up, a different meaning of Christmas
was always stressed. I learned the importance of
love, family and togetherness. I can remember
baking cookies with my mom, going to the tree
farm with my two big brothers to choose the
biggest and best pine there and then bringing the

L tree home to decorate. My brother Rob was always

in charge of putting the lights on the tree since he
was the perfectionist in the family, and my brother
Anthony and I did the ornaments since it really
didn’t matter how you threw them on a tree. I also
remember decorating our mantle with lights and
stockings andthen lighting a big fire in the fireplace
and eating popcorn by it.

These are memories thatl treasure. These are the
memories that make me look forward to Christmas
every stinking year.

Presents were never the focus of our holiday.
Granted, we loved getting them.

I still love to get them, but I love other things
more — things like spending time with my friends
and family.

This year I don’t feel that Christmas is as important
to anyone else as it is to me.

Every time I turn on the television, the
advertisements display the ﬂashiest, most expensive
gifts. Gold, furs, diamonds and cars are depicted as
the “perfect” gifts for that “special someone” in your
life. It seems that monetary, superficial gifts have
replaced what is most important about the holiday
season.

and, I’ll admit, shop for presents,

but what I found there was incredible. The parking

lot was like the Indianapolis 500, with people doing
consecutive laps in search of vacant parking spaces

but this was nothing compared to what was

inside.

When I was little, I remember going to the mall
to look at the pretty decorations. These days there
are parents who have their children on leashes and
they use the decorations as a place to tie their child
while they go into a store. People were shoving,
pushing and using their small children in baby
strollers as an excuse to run other people over as
they raced from store to store and sale to sale.

Every person was holding at least one bag with
one hand while the other was reaching into a purse
or wallet for a charge card.

As I was waiting in a I0—person-long line at
Kaufmann’s, I saw two women fighting over a
sweater. Can you guess what the reason was for the
length of my line? Yep, you guessed it! Everyone.
was paying with plastic.

I witnessed small children arguing over highly
priced Nintendo tapes in Kay-Bee Toy and Hobby
Shop and cassettes being stolen from National
Record Mart. Fifteen-year-old “mall chicks” with
big hair were surrounding the Piercing Pagoda
holding the employees hostage while they decided
which earrings they should have their heavy—metal,
head-banging boyfriends buy them.

To top it all off, all the local high school jocks and
their mothers were in Koenig Sporting Goods
choosing the latest Raiderwear, as I was attempting
to get my tennis racket restrung!

I was in shock. I later found myself standing in
front of Taco Bell, drinking a large iced tea and
secretly wishing I had a large shot of vodka in it.
Only one thought was racing through my head:
Where has the meaning of Christmas gone?

People, the definition of Christmas isn’t, “ Find the
best and most expensive gifts for your loved ones,
screw other people while trying to find them and
then expect to get something wonderful in return."
No! Instead of going with the rest of the materialistic
flow this Christmas, try spending a little more time
with your family decorating a Christmas tree.
Maybe even sing some Christmas carols and drink
some potent egg nog.

Maybe if we all began to realize that Christmas is
one giant birthday party, we could all lighten up a
bit.

Peace and happy holidays.

Bush cronies look
to improve image

Stop the presses!!

I’ve always wanted to say that. Now that I've got your
attention, I thought I’d let you in on the biggest crisis to hit the
Bush administration since the president’s puppies were born to
an unwed mother. '

What is it, you ask? Has unemployment reached 1,000
percent? Did King Whosiwhatsits of North Jebip decide to
invade the U.S.? I-las Dan Quayle been caught swiping cans of
bean dip from the White House kitchen?

None ofthe above. Actually I'm talking about the article I read
in last week’s Wall Street journal that declared the biggest

Adam Richter

problem facing Bush and company is bad publicity.

I wasn’t completely sure if this was true when I read it — after
all, you can never trust the journal——— so I spoke with Alan
Rensch, the head of Shyster, Flotsam and jetsam, the public-
relations firm that services the White House.

“The president faces the incredible task of not only turning
around the economy but also trying to look good before the
election,” Rensch told me. “Besides, let's face it. Sure, people
hate unemployment, but they hate an unpopular president,
too.”

plans to lay low for a while (or at least until Congress goes home
for the holidays) and then launch an attack on Congress that
hasn’t been matched since the British burned Washington in the
War of 1812.

“Naturally, we won’_t be using real explosives,” Rensch said.
“just a few harsh words here and there to shake them up.

“()f course some will try to say that Bush should concentrate
more on the economy, but our concern here is making him look
good for next year. It isn’t easy to do to a president, you know.
lleck, Reagan himself needed more pancake makeup than
every president before him combined.”

It sounds like the good folks at Shyster, Flotsam and jetsam
have their work cut out for them. After all, the economy is in a
really sad state righ_t now,

it will probably involve cancelling a few national holidays and
moving a few —— like the Fourth of_Iuly — up to January, so
everyone can whip out the fireworks a little sooner. It’s also the
holiday that we'll repeat pretty often next year to keep
everyone’s spirits up.”

What about the attack on Congress?

“Well, that’s easy. First of all, the Bush administration will start
off the new year by blaming both houses for everything it
possibly can. This includes the economy, Saddam Hussein,
price controls and the continued popularity of Michaeljackson, ”
Rcnsch said.

'Isn’t that a little drastic?

“A little. But after all they've put the president through, it may

be worth it.

CGS not opposed to student on committee

[article], CGS Student Government is not opposed
to student representation to the Planning and
Budgeting Committee. However Council is

concerned that an appointment
at this level will not provide the
student voice that a student
advisory committee would
provide for several reasons:

1. We question the value of input that a student
can offer in the deliberation of’a $700 million

budget.

2. We question the ability of one student to
effectively represent and comprehensively
contribute to budget determination on behalf of all

student interests, and

Letters

would not yield better results and give students a
more unified voice.

CGS Student Government is not opposed to
student representation, so long as the committee

appointment is one where the
student perspective is necessary
because of the impact that the
decision will have upon students:
An appointment is only as

valuable as the input that a student provides on
behalf of those he or she represents.

Council simply questions whether this final level

5. We question whether a conglomerate of all

student-government bodies at the advisory level

of budgetary deliberations is a constructive forum
for student input or could our voices be better

Media treated David Duke unfairly

So David Duke lost the race for
governor of Louisiana; the
mudslinging, charges and cries
of racism abruptly ended. But
give no thanks to the press, Edwin
Edwards or the people who
avoided the issues and
overwhelmingly refused to
believe that a mancan change his
ways of thinking.

Activists in their ivory towers
can now focus their telescopes
on another fleeting cause. No
more do they have to worry about
racism and its innate prevalence
in society. ’Ihey’ve paid their dues.
I-low easily the public has
forgotten the living hell made out
of the life of Clarence Thomas,
another man who had _ the
misfortune of daring to think his
own thoughts, which were against
the mainstream liberal press. Is
this a case of trying to make two
wrongs into a right?

No matter how many times
each man decried his past, the
press made sure that we knew he
couldn’t really have changed.
Assaulted with quotes, not
necessarily current, the picture of
the continuance of evil was
presented.

Of course we know that
murderers on death row can be
rehabilitated and ‘have
tremendous rights with which
they can prove their innocence
— no matter the reality — but
woe to he who thinks in
disagreement with the controllers
of the news. I can’t wait to hear
the logicthat a man cannot change
his mind against the arguers who

Joe
Babinsack  

think capital punishment is
wrong. ’

It’s a shame that David Duke
lost the election. I'd sooner believe
a once—blatant racist who claims
to have changed than a person
who uses racist tactics without
even blinking about the
immorality of it. Duke’s campaign
was not the same as George
Bush’s or Jesse Helms’. These
men are said to have created the
monster Duke. Attacking

affirmative action is one thing;
basing a campaign on ads that
elicit an anti-black hysteria is a
much greater affront to hu manity,

It’s a shame. If Duke truly has
changed, then the press has done
a great disservice by not allowing
his issues to be heard. The image
of David Duke, ex-Klan member
and neo-Nazi, was at the forefront,
yet the very next utterance decried
his continued racist attitude. If
this is so, I wish they would have
dropped the “ex-” or substantiated
the reality of David Duke, racist,
by showing present—day quotes
or facts. , -

It’s a shame that Duke lost the
election. His support, though still
alive and growing, most likely
was frightened off by the
overwhelming negative press
against their candidate. Will
anyone ever gain a satisfactory
count of the numbers of truly
racist voters who supported this

man?

It’s a shame. One man does not
create racism. The defeat of one
man does not mark a triumph
over this social ill.

It’s a shame Duke lost the

election because no lesson will
be learned from his defeat. The
Republicans used the same race-
baiting tactics to secure the
presidency. in 1988 but were
permitted to isolate themselves
from Duke. The liberals were
satisﬁed with a win and rushed to
attack the abandoned Duke. Both
sides have used Duke as a
scapegoat for the racism of the
country. ’

It’s a shame. A racist Duke
could never further his goals if
elected. He could not have uttered
a speech or enacted legislation
without the magnifying glass of
newspapers, magazines, or TV
hounding his every move. But
now he crawls under a rock —
learning, improving his charisma
and retaining the outsider status
that could propel him to more
important positions.

It’s a shame. Countless people
are claiming Duke’s loss as a
victory over racism, mindless
conservatism and dirty politics,
but in reality it has only proven
these facts as realities that can be
avoided.

It’s a shame. The actions of the
nation may have slain a racist
Duke, but it has been burying the
dream of a King for decades.

The city of Pittsburgh recently ranked

Another place on campus that was

No. 1 in a survey by Margabell Stewart, an
etiquette expert, who asked, “Where would
you like to do business and -live, from an
etiquette viewpoint?” Obviously the people
who responded to this survey did not eat
in the Towers cafeteria or ride a PAT bus.
I-Iaving hit those easy targets, I can examine
the levels of politeness you can find on
campus. Overall, ifyou really need some
help, you will get it. But some people are
more accommodating than others.
Surprising as it is, I have found that most
ofthe people in Thackeray Hall will do the
best they can to help. Consider the jobs of
some of these people. In the Office of the
Registrar, some weeks pass in which they
do nothing but type student information
into computers. They are under constant
bombardment that would make me mean
and intolerant. But in my experience, they
are pleasant and patient when you have to
replace one of your classes because the

Ed Kichline

computer says it is closed. Most of us
would act much differently under those
circumstances.

Beyond this normal courtesy, most
people expect and appreciate that if they
have a problem, they can find help. Earlier
this semester Harrisburg messed up my
loan application, so my check was very
late. My dad was in the hospital, and we
needed the money from that check to pay
my bill. But it would still be a few weeks
until the money would be available. So I
went to Thackeray to ask the university to
deduct the amount of the check from my
bill, creating a situation in which the
university would wait for the money from
the state. It was very important to us at the
time, and the people at Thackeray were
able to accommodate me. They were a
tremendous help during a difficult situation.

helpful at that time was the Pitt Ticket
Office up at the stadium. My parents had
bought tickets for one of the football
games, but my dad wound up in the
hospital that weekend. We could not use
the tickets, but they were still worth a lot
of money. I made a few trips to the office
—— always when none of the managers
were there. Finally I got to talk to one of
them, and I explained my situation. I was
given a refund for the tickets as I stood in
front of their “No Refund” sign. I could not
have asked for anything more.

On the other side of this politenesscoin
is the Hillman Library. Sure, there are
some very nice people who work there,
and I like them. Nevertheless, a few weeks
ago, I borrowed a small book from the
fourth-ﬂoor shelves. When I came back a
few days later to borrow more books, they
told me I was blocked because of too
many fines on that book. The computer

said the book was reserved, stipulating a
two-hour limit. I had had the book for
about five days. I said, “Reserved?” So I
brought the book back for them to look at,
and it was not reserved. Iwanted to keep
the book to use for my paper. I figured the
woman would fix the problem and give it
back to me. She punched some keys,
scanned the book and put it on the
reshelving rack. I was mad. I said, “Well,
was it reserved?” She said, “I don’t know.”
They should have called me to say, “Hey,
you owe $78 for a book.” I could have
easily fixed the situation. All I got from it
all was not having to pay fines I should not
have had to pay in the first place. Hillman
Library was not very accommodating.

So you say Pittsburgh is one of the most
polite cities in the United States? Well, you
must certainly be right. After you.

Panthers

By Derek Willis

Asst. Sports Editor

Looking to rebound from
Monday night’s loss to North
Carolina State, the Pitt basketball
team will host St. Francis College
of Pennsylvania tonight at
Fitzgerald Field House.

The Red Flash, from nearby
Loretto, enters the game 2-0, while
Pitt’s record stands at 5-2. Last
year the Panthers came from
behind to defeat St. Francis 91-
85. But it will be a rebuilding
squad that comes to Pittsburgh
tonight. -

In last year’s contest, Mike
Iuzzolino and‘Joe Anderson
combined for S9 of St. Francis’ 85
points. Iuzzolino is now a member
of the NBA’s Dallas Mavericks,
and Anderson graduated as the
school’s al1—time leading scorer,
leaving a young club for fifth-
year Coach Jim Baron.

Only one starter returns for the
Red Flash: center Mike Fink.
Senior swingman Harkeem Dixon
is also coming back. Dixon did
not play last year but averaged 10
points a game in the 1989—’9O
season. In the two games this
year, Dixon has stepped up his
offensive contribution, averaging

The Pitt Lady Panthers kick off

a month—long, seven—game road
trip tomorrow night when they
travel to Youngstown,“ Ohio, to
face the Youngstown State Lady
Penguins.

This game will be the first road
game of the season for the Lady
Panthers. In November they
played two games in the St.
Francis Tournament, but those
games were considered neutral-
court contests.

Pitt will take arelatively young-
team, which has no seniors and
only four juniors, to deal with life
on the road in Divison I women’s
basketball. This team has had
several unexpectedevents occur
which have cut into its pool of
talent.

First, much-traveled prep
phenom Shannon Davis
withdrew from school after the
spring term of last year. Davis’
saga has been we1l—documented.

Pitt News File Photo

VPitt's Sean Miller has enjoyed some big games against St. Francis in the past.

After a standout career at nearby
Sacred Heart High School, she
took her act to Charlottesville,
Va., to play for the perennial
powerhouse Virginia Lady
Cavaliers. After she failed to meet
UVa’s entrance requirements for
incoming first-year students,
Virginia wanted her to a-ttend a
prep school or junior college.
Davis said no and decided to
transfer to Pitt. After trying to

bring her grades up to NCAA
minimums for two semesters, she
quit school.

Next, sophomore guard/
forwardJenine Joyce left the team
for personal reasons during the
off-season.

Joyce started in 11 games for
the Lady Panthers toward the end
of the season, including nine Big
East Conference battles.
According to head coach Kirk
Bruce, Joyce will return next
season. I

As if that was not enough,
point guard Maureen McConnell,
the starter since the first game of

her first year, decided to quit the
team and school recently, leaving
Pitt vulnerable at the point.
However sophomore Erin Maloy
has stepped in and adequately
filled McConnell’s place.

Now the Lady Panthers enter
their first away contest coming
off a 69-60 loss to the Toledo
Lady Rockets. In that game, the
Lady Rockets jumped out tofa 10-
point lead at the half and cruised
home in the second half. Going
into Youngstown, Bruce said he
sees several areas that his team
must improve in if it is to emerge
from the road trip successful.

“We have to get more
aggressive if we want to win,”
Bruce said. “We had trouble
getting rebounds, and we weren’t
diving after loose balls. We need
to work on these areas as well as
boxing out for rebounds and our
screens in practice this week
before we go to Youngstown.”

' The Lady Panthers will face
another tough challenge in the
Lady Penguins. Last year

Lady Panthers take to road against YSU

Youngstown State beat Pitt at
Fitzgerald Field House 75-62.

Youngstown State is coming
off a 24-4 season in which it
advanced to the second round of
the National Collegiate Athletic
Association Tournament by
upsetting the highly ranked Scarlet
Lady Knights of Rutgers.

Gone from that team, however,
are starters Margaret Somple and
Jenny Woodward.

Somple scored 22 points and
grabbed 12 rebounds in the
Pittsburgh game last season.
Robinson contributed 16 points
and five boards to the Lady
Penguins’ effort.

However three starters have
returned for head coach Ed
DiGregorio. Senior point guard
Dianne Rappach is the team‘
leader on the floor. She is
averaging 12.7 points and five
boards and is a serious threat
from trey land.

“You definitely can’t leave her
alone,” DiGregorio said. Rappach

Ourprognosticators pic/e the best of the college bowl games

By Rob Pugliese and

Bob Maselli
The Pitt News

’Tis the season for the NCAA’s
holiday circus ‘— otherwise
known as the traditional bowl
games — that supposedly rewards
deserving teams for their fine
seasons and allegedly matches
the elite clubs in an effort to
determine a true national
champion. '

This year’s title picture is a
deep muddle with four legitimate

contenders (Washington, Miami,
Florida and Michigan) still alive
and four other clubs (Florida State,
Iowa, Penn State and Tennessee)
deserving of a title shot in some
sort of playoff scenario. ,

Let’s get excited about not only
food, fun and frolicking but about
the one thing no holiday season
should be without: football.

Fiesta Bowl — Jan. 1 at
Tempe, Ariz. —Penn State (1 0-
2) vs. (+3 1/2) Tennessee (9-
2). ,

What can you really say about

this bowl except that it will be
colossal?

Both of these clubs carried
national-championship
aspirations early in the season,
but Penn State fell to Miami in a
tough game and the Vols suffered
a similar fate at Alabama.

When you come right down
to it, both teams blend a tough
balance of offense and defense,
but the Vols deserve to get the
nod due to their overwhelming
team speed and quickness.

If you haven’t seen Vol wideout

Carl Pickens play yet, get out
from under your rock and glue
your eyes to the television ‘cause
he’s all that and more.

The Lions will counter with
powerful and explosive
sophomore Richie Anderson, who

. ripped up Maryland, Notre Dame

and Pitt down the stretch.

His success will determine how
PSU moves the football. This game
could come right down to
coaching. I

Who is the better man?

Both Joe Paterno and Johnny

Majors are veterans of the college-
football grind, and both have
seen their fair share of bowl
games.

This was a tough call, but we
gotta go with the Volunteers and
the nuggets.

Take Tennessee +3 1/2.

Rose Bowl - Jan. 1 at
Pasadena, Calif. - Washington
(11-0) at (+7) Michigan (10-1).

Well, finally we can call the
Rose Bowl “the granddaddy of
‘em all” after years of meaningless

games.

This‘ is a huge contest — the
biggest of the day and probably
the finest Rose matchu p since the
’70s wars between USC and Ohio
State. We have the best offensive

. player in the nation against the

best defensive player in the
nation. Not long after you read
this, Michigan’s magician,
Desmond Howard, will receive
the Heisman Trophy.

He is just awesome; nothing
more can be said.

Washington defensive tackle
Steve Emtman (6-foot, /1-inches,
290 pounds) dominates the line
of scrimmage while leading the
nation’s stingiest defense.

Hey, let's be honest:

We could go on all day about
this matchup. Tremendous.

It ﬁgures that this and the Fiesta
Bowl start at the same time. Watch
one, and tape the other.

A must-see game.

The Huskies will win an
impressive, hard-fought war and
the National Championship, but
Michigan will cover.

Take Michigan +7.

USF&G Sugar Bowl -Jan. 1 at
New Orleans, La. - (-6) Florida
(10-1) vs. Notre Dame (9-3).

We’re holding back the laughter
while reading this line, which
apparently has been established
by the Fighting Irish Booster Club.
Talk about charity.

The most overrated team of the
decade, Notre Dame, bullied their
way to an undeserving bid in a.
quality bowl and ruined the dream
matchup of Florida-Miami.

All we can say is that it’s too

bad Bill Walsh, Dick Enberg and
Ahmad Rashad won’t be calling
this monstrous Gator rout.

ND has no business being on
the same field as Florida.

The third-ranked Gators are
loaded.

This is the best offense in the
nation, triggered by Matthews
and featuring more weapons than
any nuclear arsenal.

The Gator D has looked tougher
each week and didn’t blink in its
7-0 blitz through the SEC.

Florida smashed Alabama 35~
0, Tennessee 35-18, Auburn 31-
10 and Georgia 45-13.

If Washington falters and Miami
wins close, hey, you never know.

The Gators, will romp 49-10.
Oddsmakers, get a clue here. Bet
your house and a month’s salary.

Take Florida -6.

17.5 points and 2.5 steals a game. Dixon is fond of the three-
point shot, having made 10 in two games. He has only taken
three shots inside the three-point arc.

On the front line Dixon is joined by Pink, who is averaging
seven points from the center spot. Fink, who is the team’s
biggest starter at 6-feet, 7-inches and 210 pounds, fouled out of
last year's game after scoring two points. The other forward is
Antoine Patterson, who was a top reserve a year ago. The senior
from Buffalo is the team’s leading rebounder and second-
leading scorer.

The backcourt is comprised of junior Willie Smith and senior
Steve Strachan. Strachan leads the team in minutes and assists,
but the number is low (seven assists in two games). The Red
Flash has had problems with turnovers so far; it has 59 and only
36 assists. But its defensive style has also forced an average of
17 steals a game. Smith has only taken seven shots in two
games, and he also has seven turnovers.

After relying on five or six players last year, Baron now has
improved depth. Sophomore forward Deon George is the top
bench player, averaging 11 points a game. , ‘

Baron’s teams have‘ made at least one three-pointer in 118
consecutive games, and that number probably will not stop
there. This team is small and relatively quick but has little inside
strength. .

Dixon is most of the offense, while George has been a
pleasant surprise off the bench. Defensively, it has held its first
two opponents, Buffalo and Mt. St. Mary of New York, to 41-
percent shooting from the floor, but opponents have enjoyed
a 51-40 advantage in free-throw attempts. The charity stripe has
been anything but helpful to St. Francis, as the Flash has hit only
55 percent of its tosses thus far.

For Pitt, Sean Miller has had big nights against St. Francis. Last
year Miller had 21 points on eight of 12 shots from the field
along with eight assists. He also hit the Red Flash for 22 points
his first year.

T onight’s game is the first road contest for St. Francis, and Pitt
leads the all-time series 16-0.

be a friend to all the athletes
because he is someone that the
athletes see more of than their
coaches.

“I try to be a-friend to all the
kids and let them know that they
can talk to me or mess around
anytime,” Mouse said. “When the
new kids come here, they are
basically just a number on a
laundry bag, and this place scares
them. You can see it in their eyes.
It’s always been that way. Many
kids show it differently. Some act
cocky, and others never say a
word. They are so quiet, but
sooner or later everyone calms
down or comes out of their shells,
and you develop a nice
relationship.” '

Mouse said he likes to develop
friendships with the athletes and
coaches, but_a few years ago,
after the departure of basketball
coach Tim Grgurich (now with
UNLV), he made up his mind to
never get close to the people
around him because he got
depressed when they left.

“When Timmy left, I was down,”
Mouse said. “I told myself I would
never get close to another person
because I was really depressed.
But after a while I found that to be
impossible It’s just too hard to
work with all these great people
and not become close with them.
You hate to see people leave, but
you must go on.”

One former Pitt basketball star,
who is now in the NFL and made
an everlasting impression on

Mouse, is Sam Clancy.

“Nothing Sam ever did surprised
me, and nothing he ever does
will surprise me,” Mouse said.
“There were a lot of guys up here
that meant so much to me, but
there was something special about
Sam. It’s hard to explain, but he
was just a plain old good guy,
and he always had something to
say or had a good story.”

Because of the position Mouse
is in, he not only gets to know
sports personalities from Pitt, but
he meets many athletes and
coaches from schools across the
country.

“One guy that I will always
remember is Chris Mullin from St.
John’s [now playing in the NBA
with the Golden State Warriors].
He was the kind of guy who
would come in here, talk to
everyone and act like he was just
out for a night,” Mouse said. “He
was so calm and cool, yet he
would go out onto the court and
play so hard. Then after the game
was over, it was just like he
finished his job for the day, and
it was time to go home. No big
deal.” I

Mouse said he loves to see
someone succeed on the field or
court, but to him the best feeling
is seeing "people mature and

succeed aftertheir sporting days;

are over. H
“It’s really great to see the kids
go on and succeed in life in the

v work force,” Mouse said. “A lot of _
people think I know so many pro 4 .

them all, and its nice when they
come back to see me. Also, many
times the team goes on the road,
and an alumni will go to the
game, and they -tell someone to
say,  to me. During Christmas
time, I get cards from all over the
country.”

Mouse, who said he considers
himself a frustrated coach, has
seen many changes in the sports
programs and the athletes
involved at Pitt over the years. He
has seen the days when nobody
went to basketball games, and he
is particularly excited that Pitt
basketball is one of the hottest
sports in town.

“There has been so many
changes that it’s hard to believe,”
Mouse said. “I remember when

nobody, andl mean nobody, came I

to the basketball games, and now
people go crazy trying to get into
the games. We used to have as
many people come to games as
there is sportswriters on the
sidelines now.-

“Athletes have changed over
the years, too,” Mouse added.
“Today these kids have a lot to
juggle between sports, classwork,
jobs, social life, not to mention
things that can get them into
trouble. It’s hard for these kids
nowadays. Being an athlete is a
year-long thing, and they must be
very disciplined.”

Just as Mouse started to talk
about some of his best memories
at Pitt, three baseball players
walked by. “Hey, Mouse, how's it
going?” they said. They asked
him where a certain list was.
Mouse said“ he didn’t know. One

of the baseballplayers said that
he should know. Mouse just
shrugged his shoulders and rolled
his eyesin disbelief. That’s how
much of Mouse’s day goes.
Joking/ a rguing with the players

' about where equipment is and

lists should be and where this
and that is. It’s all part of a long
day’s work.

Mouse said he sometimes gets
frustrated with the people he
works with, and sometimes the
hours are long, and sometimes
he wants to walk away from it all,
but then he thinks of all the
athletes, coaches, managers (who
he says he “harasses” the most)
and the fans, and then he sticks
around.

‘‘I feel like I’m living in Sports
Illustrated. It’s great being here.
I’ve seen some things that most
people only dream about.”

The contest is over. Bobby
Bonilla is ﬁnally gone — to the
Mets for just over $29 million for
five years. Now where does that
leave the Pirates? A

That is the issue. Some Pirate
fans are caught up in hating
Bonilla for leaving, but that is
unfair. He had great opportunities
to make a lot of money — a lot
more than the Pirates were willing
to pay — and he took one. He

 

 

gave the team every opportunity,
waiting as long as he did to give
the team a chance to make a
“competitive offer.” One never
came. Five years for $25 million
would have probably done it, but
$22.5 was the last offer from
Pittsburgh. Up to the end he
would have taken less money to
stay. As for loyalty, Pittsburgh
may be where he made his name
in baseball, but New York is his

As to the question of what this
does to the division, it does not
just give it to the Mets. Baseball
“experts” and fans have been
making those mistakes for years.
(See the Cubs last year and Royals

Pitt News File Photo

the previous season.)

Adding Bonilla "and Eddie

Murray definitely brings the
power back to the New York
lineup, but the defense still stinks.
Murray is solid at best at first, and
Bonilla is a very average
outfielder. Also, Bonilla’s arrival
is the end of Howard Johnson’s
move to right field. What this
team really needs is a legitimate
middle infield.
, Worse for New York is the
deterioration of the pitching staff.
David Cone is outstanding, and
John Franco is still a premier
closer, but the rest is in decline.
Free-agent Frank Viola is probably
done as a Met, and he will jump
at a good offer to go elsewhere.
Doc Gooden is still good —
unhittable at times —— but he is
nowhere near the dominant
pitcher he once was. Sid
Fernandez never was that good.
The rest of the starting staff is
unsettled, and the middle relief
has been a problem for years.

The Pirates are competitive
without Bonilla. Barry Bonds and
Andy Van Slyke are proven
producers in the middle of the
lineup.Jay Bell is coming on. They
will probably also lose third
baseman Steve Buechele, but
John Wehner will be back to take
his place. Orlando Merced will
finally get a ‘ chance to play
regularly — now in the outfield,
his natural position. If Jeff King
can return, he will take over first
base. Kevin Young, a promising
minor -leaguer who can hit but
has had problems defensively,
may also get a chance.

Whoever fills in at first, this
team does have the best starting
pitching in the division. John

Smiley may have stunk up the.

field in the playoffs, but he will

get it back together.

If any people have any doubts
about how good Doug Drabek is
after his performance in the
playoffs last yeai, they really ought
to give up that stuff they’ve been
smoking. Zane Smith is almost
that good. Randy Tomlin will
continue to get better, and Bob
Walk just keeps winning games.
The bullpen isia problem, but
manager Jim Leyland handles it
masterfully. .If anybody can take
his place in the rotation, Walk
would make a hell of a closer.

Signing free agents for help is
not out of the question. The first
priority is to hold on to catcher
Mike Lavalliere. The money the
team offered to Bonilla and
Buechele could be put toward
signing another quality player,
such as Royals outfielder Danny
Tartabull or, more realistically,
Angels first baseman Wally
Joynen

The main thing that will keep
the Pirates in contention is that
the NL East is a weak division.
The Cardinals are close, but all
they have done is trade one
underachiever, pitcher Ken Hill,
for another, first baseman Andres
Galaragga.

The Phillies can hit. Wes
Chamberlain, who would be the
replacement for Bonilla if Bucco
GM Larry Doughty had taken the
time to learn his waiver wire
rules, is going to be a star. The
Phillies still need to improve their

pitching. The Cubs might be

dangerous if they can keep their

‘pitching staff healthy, but they
probably won.’t. The Expos will »

expire from the race quickly.
(Sorry, I couldn’t resist.)

I will resist the urge to hate
Bonilla. He is a great player with
a great attitude and will be missed.

State’s history. Also returning in
the backcourt with Rappach is
senior guard Jeanna Rex, who is
averaging 10.3 points. '

' Three new starters have joined
the line up for DiGregorio. Donna
Wertz, a senior forward, is
averaging 12.3 points and 8.7

boards in her first year in a startin
role. -

Junior Donna Djorovic has
stepped in for Somple at center

15 points and seven rebounds a
contest. ‘

The other new addition to the
lineup is Rachel Crowley, a junior
guard, averaging 12.3 points and
3.7 boards.

Both coaches agreed this game

‘ will be a good test for their teams;

‘‘It’s always a great game when
we play,” DiGregorio said. “Coach
Bruce always gets his team ready
for this rivalry.” —

Bruce said, “It’l1 be an
interesting game. We need to put
together two good halves. In every
game we’ve had one good half.
We have to be more consistent.”
