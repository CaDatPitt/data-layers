Portion of activities fund goes unspent

Since 2007, more than $200,000 of the Student Activities Fund has rolled over each fiscal year.

By Michael Ringling
Staff Writer

It’s not often that money goes un-
claimed, but that’s What’s happen-
ing to parts of Pitt’s Student Activi-
ties Fund.

During the past ﬁscal year,
running fromjuly 1, 2010, to June
31, 2011, $226,546 of the Student
Activities Fund went unspent.
The more-tha-'n—$2 million fund is
derived from the $80 Student Ac-
tivities Fee that each non— College of
General Studies student pays each

semester.

The Student Government Board
distributes a portion of the fund,
and each year since 2007, more than
$200,000 has rolled over. The major-

ity of this rollover money goes back.

into the Student Activities Fund, but
the speciﬁcs of where the money is
being spent remains unclear.

Out of the total activities fund,
about 50 percent is distributed by
Student Life to ﬁve formula groups
—,Pitt Program Council, WPTS—FM,

‘Panther Prints Yearbook, Student

Volunteer Outreach and TeleFact.

The other 50 percent is allocated
by the Student Government Board
to both‘ Student Affairs Afﬁliated
Groups, also known as SAAGS, and
more than 300 certiﬁed student or-
ganizations. - '

The groups considered SAAGS
are the Resident Student Associa-
tion, Interfraternity Council, Na-
tional Pan—Hellenic Council, Colle-
giate Panhellenic Association, Black
Action Society, Asian Student Alli-

‘ ance, Engineering Student Cabinet

and Nursing Student Association.
These groups propose a yearly bud-
get to SGB and are unable to request
supplemental funding.

Terrence Milani, Student Life as-
sociate director and SGB allocations

adviser, would not comment on how
much money the formula groups and
SAAGS receive from the ﬁmd. He did
not release the ﬁgures because he
said he did not want arguments to
arise between the groups based on
differences in funding.
Milani said that $130,731 of the
unspent moneyfrom'2010-2011will
go back into the overhead account to
pay for things like the Student Orga-
' nization Resource Center and SGB’s
yearly budget of $44,551.02.
The remaining $95,815 of roll-

g , over money was given to SGB for al- '

locations in the 2011 spring term.
Milani said that the unspent in-_

. come for the 2011-2012 ﬁscal year is

-currently $383,377. Of that money,
$86,293 is goingback into the over-
head account, $97.084 went to 2011

. fall term allocations and $200,000

is going toward the 2012 spring term
allocations.
The funds from the Student Ac-

tivities Fee are distributed to various
organizations on campus by both

the Student Government Board and ‘

Student Life to fund programming,

competitions, conferences and other '

student-activity—related items and
events. -

Certiﬁed student organizations
can submit a budget for the year or
the semester, and they can also re-
quest supplemental funding.

. Suident organizations send a re-
quest form to the SGB Allocations
Committee, which reviews and dis-
cusses the request with the group
and makes a recommendation to the
Board. Final decisions are made at
SGB’s weekly Tuesday night public
meetings. — V ’

Groups can use this funding to .

hold events on campus, travel to na-
tional conferences that will bring
programming back to campus or
host guest speakers /or lecturers on

campus.

Milani authored the Allocations
Manual, which describes what SGB
can and cannot ﬁmd, and is respon-
sible for the administration of the
Student Activities Fund. He said that
SGB handles the money because he
wants students to have some control
of the ﬁind and to learn from the al-
locations process.

“It’s awell—oiled, student—run sys-
tem where students are empowered
to make decisions in a fair and open
process,” Milani said. But he said
that SGB must operate “according
to the policies and procedures” in
the manual. “

Former SGB President Molly Stie-
ber attributed the surplus money
each year to a lack of programming
requests by on—campus student or-
ganizations.

“It’s easy to say, ‘We have rollover,
let’s do something about it.’ It’s much
more complicated,” Stieber said. “If
these groups are not goingto request
for funding for programming, what
are we going to fund for?”

‘ In order to decrease the rollover
money, Stieber developed the Alloca-
tions 101 program to help student or-
ganizations understand the policies
for funding and to increase groups’
reception of funds. She ran the ﬁrst
program in January 2011. The in-
formation sessions invited student
groups to meet with SGB members
to go over the most common request
problems the Board sees.

“I think this year we have seen
more groups putting on more pro-
gramming,” Stieber said. “I think it
started with Allocations 101.”

SGB Presidentjames Landreneau
said he plans to continue the pro-
gram as well as institute a new initia-
tive. He is developing an on—campus

leadership summit that will center’

on opening communication between

student groups so they can put on

programmingtogether and facilitate

more use of the money. ‘
“The main way to get groups in-

] volved with each other is to create

contact,” Landreneau said. “I’m hop-
ing the on-campus leadership sum-
mit will be popular with all student
organizations.” .

Landreneau said that he would
like to ‘see more of the unspent
money go back to students, particu-
larly for on-campus programming.
Programs funded by SGB that are

"held on campus must be open to all
students.

He said that the majority of the
requests he saw as a 2011 Board
member were for student group con-
ferences, tournaments and competi-

tions, which primarily beneﬁt the

members of individual groups.
“The Student Activities Fund
should reach out to as many students
as it can,” Landreneau said. “I want
to make sure gfoups are applying for

money for good programming.” I

 

Students pay $80 each semester into the Student Activities Fund. Below, in hun-
dreds of thousands, is how much of the Fund is rolling over into the next year.

CAUCUS

FROM PAGE 1

_curately predict the winner of the

Republican primaries.

“I think [the Iowa caucuses]
have a more narrowing effect than
they do actually choosing someone.
Essentially, it gives someone like
Rick Santorum a chance to compete
on a more national level,” he said.

According to a pre-New Hamp-
shire primary Gallup poll, Romney
appears to be the current Republi-
can front—runner in the state, re-

p ceiving 30 percent of ballot support

betweenjan. 1 andjan. 7. Santorum
ranked in second and received 18
percent, with former House Speak-

’ er Newt Gingrich right behind him

with 17 percent.

So far, theresults of the Iowa
caucuses and polling data have
aligned with the general senti-
ments of‘the Pitt College Republi-
cans, who took a straw poll of their
members earlier in the semester.
The majority of the group chose
Romney, the former Massachusetts
governor, as the Republican candi-
date they would like to see as the
future president.

The majority of the group did
not align with the candidate that
calls Pennsylvania home, and
Rankin said it’s because Santorum
hasn’t been as present in his home
state since he left the Senate ——_
though his campaign is based out
of Verona, Pa.

“Santorum really hasn’t been
in Pennsylvania full time since
he lost his election as senator in
2006,” Rankin said. “I guess there’s
more a degree of familiarity [with
Santorum in Pennsylvania] than
there are with some of the lesser-
known candidates, but compared
to the ones who are more nationally
known —— like Romney or Ging-
rich — as a whole, people know
less about him. He has been out of
office for six years now and hasn’t

really been on the forefront up until
this year.”

Santorum graduated with a
master’s degree in business ad-
ministration from Pitt in 1981, and
after receiving his Juris doctorate
from Penn State’s Dickinson School
of Law, he worked for K&L Gates
law ﬁrm in Pittsburgh throughout
the latter part of the 1980s.

“I share the values of the work-
ing people in that district,” Santo-
rum said last Tuesday night, speak-
ing about his own Pennsylvania
district. “If we have someone that
can go out to Western Pennsylvania
and Ohio and Indiana and Michigan
and Iowa and Missouri and appeal
to the voters that have been left
behind by a Democratic Party that
wants to make them dependent in-
stead of valuing their work, we will
win this election.”

A representative from San-

torum’s campaign could not be _

reached for comment.

Pat Dunham, chair of Duquesne
University’s political science de-
partment, said that what separated
Santorum _from the other candi-
dates in the Iowa caucuses was
that he visited all of the counties to
campaign. Other candidates relied
on television ads and appearances
on cable television shows to gain
support.

Dunham said that Iowa is used
to “retail politics,” where voters get
to see the candidates up close and
personal, and this might have been
a factor that played into Santorum’s
success in the caucuses. Dunham
also said that Santorum’s issue
positions appeal to evangelical
voters and that many voters who
participate in the Iowa Republican
caucuses are evangelicals.

“Iowa is a small state. Not a lot
of delegates are chosen there,”
Dunham said. “The importance [of
the Iowa caucuses] gets magniﬁed
by the media because, for the ﬁrst
time after months of campaign-
ing, we actually get to hear from
the voters.” ﬂ

Fix NcAAacademic standards  

The problems with college sports

grow larger still — and academ- '
ics stand opposite athleticsin I

this week’s.scu{'lle. ‘

TheNCAA Division I Board of
Directors announcedin October
that it would raise its incoming-
freshman minimum GPA from
2.0 to 2.3. And at the time, we
praised them for their‘apparent
commitment to their ‘student-
athletes’ academic eﬁicacy.

But Gerald S. Gurney, e co-
author of a study thattwill be

presented today at theannual "

NCAA convention in Indianap-
olis, argues thatthe increased

GPA requirement makes little '

difference.

. The NCAA uses asliding scale
to determine freshman academic V

eligibility. A high GPA may com-
pensate for a low SAT score, or
vice versa. This meansthat,
under current rules, a student

with a 2.3 GPA would need an I

SAT (verbal and math) score of

900. A student with a 3.0 would,

only need a score‘ of 620.
Gurney says this scale is the
reason that thousands of stu-
dent-athletes are admitted to
four—year institutions despite
the fact that they lack the basic

skills required to succeed aca-

demically.

Major clustering, cheating
and failure to graduate are all
symptoms of the same disease:

the ostentatious prioritizing of '

college athletics over academics.
We don’t think we should blame

the athletes ‘or theguidelinesthat 

determine their eligibility.

It’s time we blame the way ad-
ministrators, alumni and fans
view college sports. ,

Student—athletes are known

as such for a reason. But stillthey I »
are -treated brazenly by their nni— I

versities as nothingmore than
employees. ” ‘T I e

Countless universities are
.now involved in an arms race
with the NCAA. Colleges skirt
‘NCAA rules, and in turn the
NCAA creates new rules. It’stime

the two establish a*c-Common goal-.« I
to place academics"on the fore-r

We realize that student—ath- .

letes sign up for the college expe-
rience. that they get. And we also

_ realize that the way the nation. 0

THE SCHAFFIDAVIT

llse College Readershiprmorney for public nee

Matt Schaff
Columnist '

   
 

It’s always entertaining to watch
people spend their peers’ obliga-
torily relinquished wealth. From
congressional budget battles to
student government initiatives on
Pitt’s campus, big—dollar ‘political
theater invites us to pull up chairs
-and stuff our faces with handfuls
of popcorn. , V .
Cue the rise and fall of collegiate
readership. Cycling back on what
looked in 2011 like an encourag-
ing new program bubbling with
ambition, our Student Government

' Board met last week to take The

New York Times and USA Today
off the stands indeﬁnitely. This
once-ﬂedgling Collegiate Reader-
ship Program, which only after
intense work by student leaders
put daily editions of the two news-
papers in several Pitt buildings be-
tween spring and fall 2011, is now
kaput.

Surely, it’s not over for the pro-
gram, as the newspapers could po-

tentially reappear if lockable “drop . ‘

boxes” prove to reliably distinguish
College of General Studies students
from those the SGB actually rep-

resents (such as Arts 8: Sciences
students), according to The Pitt
News. But if you care to read into
the “unanimous” nature of the
Board’s vote not to fork over the
$30,500 needed to continue the
program, the support ship for col-
lege readership might have sailed.
Bon voyage. “ .

For me, it’s a sad goodbye. That’s
not to say the program struck me
as the single greatest idea for cam-
pus improvement since the latex
condom; in fact, I’ve yet to be con-
vinced of the worth of dipping into
the Student Activities Fee just for
hard copies of publications that
could otherwise be accessed via
alreadyiavailable academic data-
base LexisNexis. g

In addition, the idea that deep-
ening the bath of current events
information submerging today’s
young people would somehow im-
prove them must be dispelled —- as
college students, we should really
be focusing on howto criticize our
news, not how to get even more
news." And even if the program
injects more paper-bound news
into the Pitt environment, there’s
no guarantee the papers get to the

- appropriate students or effect the
_ desired impact, as the SGB mem-

bers complain.

So instead of lamenting the
passing of a program for the typical
reasons — elegant design, ﬂawless
execution or thunderous applause
from bettered recipients — my
sadness over the possibility of col-
legiate readership leaving Pitt is of

an entirely different vein: It’s com-

forting to witness a government di-
recting other people’s cash toward
projects honestly believed to be
constructive and broadly impact-
ful. With or without positive or even
clear results, the piloting of the Col-
legiate Readership Program should
be remembered as an exercise in
courageous benevolence. And for
that, I’m proud of my student rep-
resentatives (well, I suppose that
means the voting constituent of
last year’s representatives).
Indeed, the national newspa-

pers might not return to the lob-
by of the William Pitt Union and
their other former locations, but
the Board’s benevolent spirit need
not be whisked away by cold gusts
of January wind. If my advanced
mathematical calculations are cor-
rect, the Board’s coffers are now
occupied by undirected ﬁinds to
the tune of $30,500 per year (i.e.,

the cost of renewing the Collegiate '

Readership Program). Since these
dollars were once earmarked to pay

fora project designed to beneﬁt
the average student, it only makes
sense to spend them with“tlie same

. goal in mind, except, of course,

doing things other than buying
newspapers. Below are two pro-
posals that I believe would serve
the student community as whole
and thus exemplify the practical
program ideas that deserve dibs
on extra SGB money:.

Financial literacy education. I
know, I’ve touched on this before,
but without any powerful people
having acted’ on it since (I called
on Dean of Students Kathy Hum-
phrey last time), someone’s got to

bring it up again. With college stu'— .

dents taking out a record number
of loans to ﬁnance higher educa-
tion, they ought to have personal
ﬁnance skills —- that is, balancing

checkbooks, paying utility bills and ~

living within means. As far as I can

tell, students enter college largely *

without much experience doing
any of that, potentially at their

own ﬁnancial peril. That’s where
I believe universities, now inter-
ested in mitigating student stress,

can step in. And Pitt’s SGB could 4

lead the charge —— whether it uses
the available newspaper money
to put on something as glossy as
a ﬁnancial literacy symposium or
simply to advertise an on—campus
helpdesk, it would be doing good
by its peers. '

A formal Pitt “ride-sharing”
network. Stepping back, it’s quite
remarkable that a university of
Pitt’s caliber doesn’t_ currently of-
ferone of these (a commenteron

The Pitt News’ website was simi-
larly amazed last month). Sure,

Pitt’s website has links to outside "

companies that coordinate car-
pools for students commuting in
the Pittsburgh area. But most un-
dergrads don’t commute. Instead,
what’s clearly needed is a system

. that organizes long-range holiday

carpools between students. Typi-

' cally, car-less students are forced

to pack into crowded, odorous
vehicles and pay exorbitant travel
fees during the Thanksgiving, win-
ter and spring recesses while car-
owning students (and parents who

5

pick up their kids on campus) drive
home with vacant seats collecting
dust on the road. An SGB—initiated
holiday—ride-share program could
ﬁx this inefﬁciency and, in the pro-
cess, make life a little more relax-
ing for a whole lot of people. just
a thought._ '

making lists is a great tool for stay-

lists, it’s important to make both
short-term and long—term lists.,In
the short term, include everything

of days. For the long term, include
things that need to be done within

This keeps your workload in _

them separated, as putting long-
term- items on the same list as
short-term items weighs down the
list. It feels really good to cross
things off and ﬁnish a list, but I ﬁnd
it discouraging when I can’t ﬁnish
a to-do list because it includes a
project that isn’t due in the same
time frame as the others.

So keep multiple lists. And keep

Aviciip Dls sold-out shu at StagevAE

STORY BY SKYLAR WILCOX ‘

How far house music has come. Once hidden
away in clandestine warehouse parties: now
cities like Pittsburgh openly welcome house
D]s like the Swedish Avicii.

Avicii’s Sunday night performance at
Stage AE sold out far in advance, and sec-
ond—hand tickets were going for $100. The
concert’s total proﬁts will beneﬁt House for
Hunger, an organization dedicated to raising
money for hunger relief through concerts.
With the visibility and charitable efforts,
Avicii’s dual tour with Ash Pournouri seems
far from the powder—ﬁlled basement clubs
of yesteryear.

The audience has drastically" changed

as well. Only a handful of glowing paciﬁers
—— once a hallmark of rave culture — lit
up against abackdrop of lacrosse tees and
knee—high socks. A pair of LED light gloves
would occasionally rise above the churning

mass, but it was quickly lost in a forest of .

pumping ﬁsts.

The stigmatized “Techno” music with
its tweaked out teenagers swapping plas-
tic bead “kandi” was nowhere to be seen.
Instead, people were here to sway beneath
chest—compressing bass and glitched—.out
breakdowns. ‘

Avicii will play over the course of his 27-day ‘

tour. ' ‘ . L

A young Swede can push some remixes
and afew original tracks to YouTube and
build a worldwide following almost instantly.

genres so much as synonyms forrpartying.
Since much of the music Avicii spun was not
his own, these concerts are a means of party-
ing with people of similar music tastes.

When Avicii arrived onstage, promptly
an hour’ after doors opened, he plunged
straight into two hours of house music.
There was no-chit—chat, no “How are you
feeling, Pittsburgh?” He didn’t speak to the
audience at all. ‘i '

Even C] Townsend, the opening D] from
Columbus, Ohio, tried to humanize the digi-
tal beats with remarks like “I need everyone
to completelybug out in, like, 2.2 seconds.”
Townsend’s"varied set included several dub-

ton from Dillon Francis.

Avicii’s more limited palette of house mu-
sic still managed to keep the crowd jumping.
The Dj borrowed several techniques from
the aggressively simpliﬁed dance music of

dubstep. Gradual builds led to ﬁst-pumping‘

drops that plunged the strobe-lit pit into an
abyss of waving hands and gyrating hips.

’ Unfortunately, when Avicii failed to drop
a fat bassline after a predictable build, hun-
dreds of deprived ﬁst pumpers cursed the
DJ. Not to leave his fans disappointed, Avicii
worked inva proper drop only a fewgbars
later, twice as monstrous as if to make up‘

i for the pause.

This cycle of lull, build, drop continued
for most of the show, rarely deviating from
Euro house standards. Avicii mixed his four
original tracks into the blend, playing his

enormously popular track “Levels’.’l twice to,i_

wardsthe end of the performance people '

began screaming “Skrillex” — for Skrillex’s

remix of “Levels” — as if Avicii had been

hogging the iPod all night.

While any music snob can pretend that

they came to the show to see the musician-
ship of Avicii live, the real reason was to go
bananas to some incredible house music.
Whether that means grinding with a hot
body, jumping and ﬁstpumping with the bros
or staring blindly into the strobe lights, club
music is whataevery attendee makes it.

As Pittsburgh’s weather turns grim, Ann
Stone ﬁnds it harder and harder to stay
awake ‘duringtheg last push“ to get her art
degree.‘ 2 ‘  ’ '“ “‘  ‘” 

The Carnegie Mellon student drags her- ‘

self out of bed in the morning and starts
to feel sleepy by 6 or 7 p.m. Even though
she said it“sounds ridiculous,” she ﬁnds
that gray skies always seem to put her in
a melancholic or lethargic mood, making
it difﬁcult to.do the things she loves, like
reading and writing.
While it’s not uncommon for students
A to feel a bit lethargic as they transition
back into their classes, for some people,
behavior like Stone’s is a sign of seasonal
affective disorder, also known as SAD.
V SAD is a type of mood disorder and is
recognized as recurring depressionwith
seasonal onset and seasonal remission,
said Marian Vanek, director of Student
Healthservice. . _ -
Symptoms of both SAD and depression
include depressed‘ mood, decreased interest

in activities once found enjoyable, loss of
focus and attention, increased or decreased
appetite, hypersomnia (oversleeping), lack
of energy and social withdrawal. The dif-
ference between the two is that SAD only
occurs during a set time of the year.

Though she has never been diagnosed
with SAD or depression, Stoneiadmits that
she sometimes displays all of these symp-
toms. But the symptoms do not always
mean a student has depression or SAD,
explained Tevya Zukor, the director of Pitt’s
Counseling Center.

’ The disorder, commonly and incorrectly
referred to as the “winter blues,” is a form
of depression that occurs around the same
time each year, typically beginning in Oc-
tober or November and subsiding around
March or April.

Though it comes and goes with winter,
experts still aren’t entirely sure what trig-
gers SAD. It’s believed that the decreased
amount of light in the Winter could con-
tribute, Vanek said.

Some treatments for the disorder, like
those for depression, involve therapy and

‘medication. Others, however, center on the

Shopping for clothes is hard. Although many
claim shopping as a favorite pastime or away
to relax, the actual process of ﬁnding well-
made and ﬂattering clothing can be_ very
stressful. Be it the cost, the ﬁt‘or a general
dislike of what’s currently in trend, staying
stylish is frustrating. .

Enter a resolution: homemade clothing.

Trying to ﬁgure out how to buy a pattern
seems complicated and maneuvering your
way around a sewing machine can be down-
right daunting, but once you get into the swing
of things, the process is simple. With home
sewing, you’ll end up saving money, having
clothes that are made to ﬁt your body and
bragging rights that are pretty cool too. Get-
ting to say, “Oh, this old thing? I just made it
last week, no big deal,” when asked where
you bought your skirt is actually quite sat-
isfying.

At one point, home sewing was de rigeur,
mostly due to the lack of actual clothing
stores. It has since became antiquated, rel-

But in the past few years, craft
hobbies once believed to be
old-fashioned have been mak-
ing a comeback — people have
again taken up sewing, knitting,
crocheting and other similar pas-
times.

When I was a little girl, /_
my mother would often 4%-
take on sewing projects to
make a little extra cash, or
“fun money” as.she called
it. She would make ﬂags,
curtains, upholstery for fur-
niture, clothing for friends
and dresses and costumes for
my sister and me. In fact, I grew up
thinking itwas the norm to have a new,
custom—made Halloween costume
every year; I didn’t realize you could

actually buy your costume until I was I

thingl ever made was a drawstring
bag, and it was awesome; I used
that thing for years. Later, in high
school, my love of sewing really

took off, and I began to make my

One of the toughest things about
sewing is knowing where to start. I

fore heading out and invest-

might seem silly, knowing_how to sew by

in the future. Addie Eichman, who has
taught FACS at Welsh Valley Middle School

stresses the importance of learningto sew.
, “It teaches you independence, just to make
repairs, sew on buttons,” she explained.

I also recommend taking classes. Craft
stores like ]o—Ann Fabrics or Hobby Lobby
offer classes, as do many community

centers and night schools. Eichman

mentioned that some of her students come
in with a knowledge of sewing from events
they’ve attended at local craft stores.

Even without lessons, it’s easier than ever
to pick up sewing with online Video tutorials.

A simple YouTube search will turn up dozens

of videos showing you what to do.

A few general tips: When looking for the
right sewing machine, make sure you do your
research. Call different stores, read reviews
online, and generally try to ﬁnd a machine

- that is cost—effective and simple to use. Or

Keepin mind that a lot of extras like bows and

trim can be left off and that you get to choose.

your own fabric. Some of my favorite pieces
— also the ones I get the most compliments
on — are the items that are simple and don’t

scream, “I made this in my basement.” The ’

point is to get people to ask you ‘where you
got something, and then surprise them by
saying you made it.

An important tip: Make sure to measure
yourself before you look for a pattern and
do this at home. You’ll need to measure your
bust, waist and hips,‘and be honest with your-
self. I know there’s a tendency when shopping
to lie about sizing, but when you’re making
your own clothes, it’s important to get the size
right. As awarning, sizing in patterns tends to

run small, so don’t be surprised when, if you’re
normallya 6, you have to buy a size 8 or even
10 in a pattern. No one has to know.

Another important suggestion is to make
sure to read directions thoroughly. Then read
them again before you cut out your fabric.
That way you can make adjustments to pat-
terns beforehand, which will save you a lot
of conﬁision later.

Take your time. If you want your piece to
look good, you have to put in the effort.

“When we teach [sewing] in school, it’s a
totally different experience. Generally it’s a
lot of ﬁm, once [the students] get the hang of
it. It’s teaching kids discipline, to wait for a
ﬁnished product,” Eichman explained.

Once‘ you get the hang of sewing, try “

branching out. Look for vintage patterns on-
line or in local fabric stores‘ —— for instance,
Loom Exquisite Textiles in the Strip District.
You can even collect pattern books. I recently

purchased a book by design house Built By ’

Wendy, and I love it.
Once you get really good, you might even
be able to sell some of your designs. For the

Pittsburgh native, Handmade Arcade is the

perfect venue, or you could sell things online
at Etsy.com.

Ultimately, sewing is one of my favorite

hobbies. Not only do I get something new
to wear out of it, but it’s an interesting way
to develop your personal style. As Eichman
says, “It’s fun, relaxing, and you get to be
creative.” I - '

    It teaches you»,

independeinoe,i 

to make repairs, sew
on buttons.
— Addie Eichman

try to ﬁnd a used one — ask your mother
or grandmother if she has an old machine

. she;,doeysn’t use anymore. I use my mother’s

20-year-old machine, and it holds up pretty
well. ' _ L

If you’re not ready to commit to a machine,
places like Cut & Sew Studio in East Liberty let
you use their machines for a small fee.

Once you have your machine, buy a few
notions —— pins, thread, bobbins, etc. — to
get yourself started.

Then it’s time to pick a pattern — the plan
for what you’re going to sew. When you’re just
starting out, I recommend picking a sim-
ple one. Eichman usually has her students

start with pajama pants. Kathy Wendel, who ~

works the sewing department of the Robin-
son Hobby Lobby, says one of the beneﬁts to
picking a simple pattern is that new clothing-

makers can mess up without really damaging

the piece.
“Beginners come in with patterns that are
easy to start with, like curtains or something.

__And when they make a mistake, it’s easy to

ﬁx,” Wendel said.
When I ﬁrst started sewing, I tried making
a shirt that was way out of my league’. In the

‘ end, it did nothing more than frustrate me — I

never even ﬁnished the shirt. Instead, I made
a simple shift dress that I wear to this day.

. Picking a simple pattern also helps to
ensure your piece doesn’t end up looking

homemade. Some of the pieces you’ll see in a

pattern books are hilariously tacky, and the
end product will clearly look like you made
it yourself. Havea discerning eye. If you ever
went shopping and thought, “This would -be
cute if only it didn’t have ...” this is that “if

' only” moment.

Look at the basic silhouette of the pattern.

times of the day or begin waking to alarm

to more light, in which their environment

This is reﬂected in the prevalence of SAD
in different states. The occurrence rate in
Maine might be as high as 10 percent, while
in Florida it’s as low as 2 percent. Pittsburgh
ranks in between at around a 6 or 7 percent
occurrence rate, Zukor said.

Data and studies about SAD are fairly
limited, but experts estimate that it af-
fects as low as 0 percent and as high as 9.7
percent, depending on the region. Because
it’s related to wintry conditions associ-

ated with changing seasons, populations I

up north tend to be more affected, Vanek
said.

Some deﬁnitions of the disease add that
SAD commonly develops in young adults,
particularly those in their early twenties.

But Zukor questions whether the disease
truly develops at this age or whether, in-
stead, it’s simply identiﬁed at this age after
a pattern of depression is observed.

oping depression during a speciﬁc time of
the year, Zukor said. If no pattern presents
itself, some people might be treated for
depression instead, because the symptoms
are so similar.

“The expression I use is, there is a dif-
ference between depression and ‘sad things
make me sad,”’ Zukor said. “Everyone has a
bad day and could show similar symptoms
[to depression] just because of that.

“The real mark we use to try to ﬁgure out
when something is depression, is  when
people experience a lot of those symptoms
for a couple of weeks or so, and it begins
to interfere with their life. Then it isn’t a
temporary problem.” V

to Zukor, who believes the stress levels of
students explains why many people begin
to notice SAD in college.

“When we think about the stress we ex-

said. “We have the stress of a semester end-
ing. We have the stress of graduation. And
during the summer, while there’s stress, it’s
a bit different than the academic pressure
and responsibilities people have during the
rest of the year.”

Treating the disorder can involve certain
devices, like the therapeutic lightboxes,
that most other-disorders do not require.

The person with SAD will sit near a light
therapy box, which gives of bright light
that mimics natural outdoor light.

I “Light therapy basically involves a full-
spectrum light,” Zukor explained. “Stu-
dents who spend time under this light for

I 30 to 45 minutes every morning tend to

report a big increase in their moods.”
Pitt’s Counseling Center has light boxes

.- for student use. Light therapy, however, re-

quires a daily time commitment. For some
students, sunrise clocks are a better option
and treatment, Zukor said.

“It’s an alarm clock that mimics the sun-
rise,” he said. “You set an alarm, but instead
of beeping, the alarm begins building light
intensity and mimicking a sunrise. Most
of them come along with audible alarms.
And it’s very interesting because they really
seem to work. Most of the work, though,
happens in your brain before you wake
up.”

Zukor expects that many students, Stone
included, will feel considerably better later
in the year as well.

“March tends to be the month we have
spring break, and I always go somewhere
warm and sunny,” Stone said. “I come back
feeling much better, no matter how the
weather is in Pittsburgh.”

' But Zukor stresses that anyone who
wants or needs help should always use any
resources Pitt has to offer.

“Someone who has had depression

I understands that big difference between

having a bad day and being depressed,”
he said. A

Students who think they have depres-
sion or SAD should make appointments
either at the Student Health Service or the
Counseling Center. I

  Panthers
prep for No. 8
  Rutgers

By Greg Trietley
Senior Staﬁ Writer

The Pitt women’s basketball team
has another crack Tuesday at its
ﬁrst Big East win this season. Un-
fortunately for the Panthers, they

" face the stingy defense of the No.

8 Rutgers Scarlet Knights.

The Scarlet Knights tip off
against the struggling Panthers at
7 p.m. at the Petersen Events Center

in a matchup. of teams at opposite ' -

ends of the standings.

Pitt (8-8, 0-3 Big East) dropped
its ﬁrst three conference games —
losses to Georgetown, Villanova
and Syracuse — and enters Tues-
day 1-8 in its last nine Big East con-
tests dating back to last season.

Pitt head coach Agnus Berenato

said after the 83-60 loss to Syra-
cuse on Saturday that the Panthers
haven’t received the scoring they
need from their guards in order
to win. _ 5 .
“We’ve got to get production
[from our guards]. We‘ have to be
able to get baskets in,” she said. “If
you can’t score, you’re not going to
win games.” _

Rutgers (13-2, 2-0 Big East)
beat Cincinnati, 58-47, Saturday
in Piscataway to post its best start
to a season since 2007-2008, when
the team likewise opened 13-2. The
Scarlet Knights dominated for 40
minutes, leading wire-to -wire and
holding the Bearcats to 15 points in
the ﬁrst half. '

Senior April Sykes had a double-
double with 11 points and 11 re-
bounds in the victory. Sykes leads
the Scarlet Knights with 14.6 points
per game.

Junior forward Monique Oliver

and senior guard Khadijah Rushdan 4

also produce double-digit points
per game for Rutgers. The trio ac-
counts for nearly 60 percent of the
Scarlet Knights’ offense this year.

They’re just as talented defen-
sively. Rutgers has kept its last four
opponents under 55 points, and in
a Dec. 18 game against Iona, the
Scarlet Knights held the Gaels to
29.

Opponents have shot 32.5 per-
cent from the ﬂoor against Rutgers
this year.

That’s an ominous statistic for
the Panthers, who have struggled
to hit shots from the perimeter re-
gardless of the opponent. Pitt ranks
15th in the conference with a 26.9
3-point shooting percentage.

Sophomore transfer Abby Dowd
and freshman Brianna Kiesel, two-
thirds of Pitt’s starting backcourt,
combined for three baskets against
the Orange. Redshirtsophomore
Ashlee Anderson, comparatively
the elder of the young Panthers
group, had 14 points and nine re-
bounds. ‘ -

As Pitt continues to struggle to

ﬁnd a rhythm on offense, opposing '

coaches have commented on the
youth and inexperience evident in
the team, which feature no upper— -
classmen on its roster.

“Pitt’s a very young basketball
team,” Syracuse head coach Quen-
tin Hillsman said Saturday. “It’s
just one of those things where you
have a young team, and they keep
playing, keep ﬁghting. You have to
give them a lot of credit.”

Pitt committed 23 turnovers
Saturday. Berenato said after the
loss that protecting the ball and
limiting turnovers would be a focus
of practice leading up to Tuesday’s
game.

“We can’t have that number of
turnovers,” she said. “Every time
one of our kids wanted to go ahead
and penetrate [against Syracuse], I
felt we were hesitant, but they just
sagged in and had help side, and it
was a turnover  That’s something
we have to correct.”

The Panthers have the worst
assist—to—turnover ratio in the Big
East, turning the ball over twice for

every assist they register.

The lack of ball security is part‘
of the reason Pitt has given up'67.8 .

points per game at the other end
of the court this year, the highest
average of any Big East team.

Anderson said after the Syra-
cuse loss that the Panthers have
been too laid back on defense,
committing fouls instead of forc-
ing turnovers. “We just have to
have more defensive intensity and
have more pressure on them,” she
said.

The road won’t become any
easier after Tuesday. The game
against Rutgers kicks off a string
of three consecutive games against
ranked Big East programs. The
Panthers will travel to Chicago to
face No. 21 DePaul Saturday, and
then they play at the high-scoring
No. 2 Notre Dame Fighting Irish
next Tuesday. g

Tebow,
Foster
explode

By Isaac Saul
Assistant Sports Editor

I When the NFL playoffs kicked

off this weekend, it was tough to
choose a storyline to follow.
In the AFC, the Texans had

made their ﬁrst playoff game ever "

and were set to take on a Bengals
team that looked reborn.

A banged-up Steelers squad
was preparing to face off with the
unpredictable Tim Tebow — a
man who has dominated head-
lines all year for both his clutch
play and vehement religious be-
liefs. ‘_

In the NFC, we were all an-
ticipating Drew Brees’ return to
the playoffs on the heels of his
record-breaking regular season
when he shattered a 26-year-old
record set by Dan Marino for
passing yards. His opponent? The
Detroit Lions, another franchise
back from the dead — this one led
by Calvin “Megatron”]ohnson —
a goliath of a wide receiver with
hands like magnets andlegs like
pogo sticks. '

"In the ﬁnal wildcard matchup,
New York fans were waiting to
see Eli Manning prove he was a
playoff vet by knocking off the
youthful and exciting Atlanta
Falcons.

‘ Forty-eight hours later, the list
of stories has thinned: the Bron-
cos, Texans, Giants and Saints
have moved on, while the top-
ranked Patriots, Ravens, Packers
and 49ers wait in anticipation.

What We Learned in the
AFC

It’s possible that Houston
might actually, really, truthfully
be for real. Maybe.

Arian Foster is Arian Foster.
His legs don’t hurt anymore. He
is the best running back in the
NFL playoffs right now.

Andy Dalton and A.J. Green

are an exciting duo, but they’re a '

few years away from making a run
deep into the playoffs together.

Davis arising leaderfor Panthers 0

Byjasper Wilson
Staﬁ’ Writer

Marquel Davis ﬁghts through a screen against -

Seton Hill, reaching toward the ball handler ,_
as she falls to the ground. A whistle. Offensive ‘

foul. Pitt ball.

Stoic up until this moment in the play,
Davis'slaps the ﬂoor in elation and runs back
on defense.

A sophomore guard, Davis has emerged as

one of the stars on the Pitt women’s basketball
team this season.

“I feel like coming into college,_I had lot
of jitters or nervousness, so I didn’t really
know what I could do, whatl should do,”
Davis said. _

\ Now in her second season, Davis is playing
a key role for the Panthers, thanks, in part, to
her tireless work ethic, Pitt head coach Ag-
nus Berenato said.“She earned [her success]
from the summer and the spring, and we saw
improvement,” Berenato said. “She spentthe .
time over the summer playing pickup and
trying to get better.”

Tonight, Davis will face one of her biggest
challengesyet: April Sykes.

The senior guard from Rutgers is coming
off a week during which she was selected to
the Big East Weekly Honor Roll after racking
up 14 points, seven rebounds and four steals

against Syracuse.
Davis can help Pitt rise to the challenge
with her play and her voice. Though the

guard started out quiet on the court and on A

the bench, Berenato said, that has started
to change.

“This year she’s learned a little bit, so she’s
come out of herself as a teammate on the

court,” Berenato said.’

Berenato wants Davis tofcontinue to be-

come more vocal.

“When you’re a basketballplayer, you can’t
be quiet,” she said. ‘V 0

Davis has found it difficult to change her
habits.

“I’m a quietbasketball player,” Davis said. '

“I’ve always been that way.”
Redshirt sophomore Ashlee Anderson

said Marq_uel’s on—court per_sonality‘.differs

greatly from how she acts off it.

“Marquel is an individual that you have to

get to know tolbring out that personality that
she has,” Anderson said. .“She’s very outgoing
when you get to know her. Soifwe can convey
that more on the court, then you’ll see a heck
of a player.”

This year, Davis has found herself in not
only a starting role, but also a leadership role
on a team that is the youngest in Division I
women’s basketball. ’ ,

“She is that leader on the court that you
can look to when things are going bad,” Leeza

Burdgess, a redshirt sophomore, said. “Mar-
quel is deﬁnitely that type of person who
calms everybody down, and, you know, makes
a play when a play is needed.” -
Burdgess has heard the difference. “[This
year], if she’s on the bench, you can deﬁnitely
hear her voice,” Burdgess said. “It deﬁnitely
was different last year where you kind of had
to be like, ‘Come on ’Quel, talk.’ But now like
she’s telling other people like, ‘You gotta talk,’

' and tellingeverybody where she’s supposed _ 

to be.” ,

“Now I feel like my conﬁdence is way bet-
ter going into games,” Davis explained. .

Davis struggled offensively followinga
concussion she sustained in a Nov. 29 game
against Mount St. Mary’s, averaging only 3.6
points in her ﬁrst three games post-injury. The
team struggled as well, going 0-3.

Since that losing ‘streak, Davis has re-
turned to her impressive form, continuing
todisplay facets of her game that_didn’t exist
last season. “She had ﬁve rebounds in one
game [against Loyola (Md.)] ,” Berenato said.
“That’s something that before wouldn’t have
happened.” i ’ '

Before the concussion, Davis averaged
20.7 points per game, including a career-high
26 points against Central Michigan. Her high
last season was eight points.

Having a rookie defensive end return an
interception for a touchdown is the fastest
way to deﬂate an-offense.

Don’t bet against Tim Tebow. Ever.

The Steelers defense relies on a healthy
line up front — one it didn’t have this
year. _

Ben Roethlisberger should not have
played against the _49ers a few weeks ago.
His ankle hasn’t been right since.

Demaryius Thomas has arrived. His 204
yards on four receptions and the game-
winning touchdown have cemented him
as Tebow’s' favorite target. '

-' Defense continues to be the most im-
portant thing to have in the AFC.

What We Learned in the NFC

Johnson — even in defeat  simply
can’t be touched. Despite double and triple
teams, hecontinued to dominate all game.
He is the best wide receiver in the NFL.

Brees has more command over his of-
fense than any other quarterback in the
playoffs right now. Even Aaron Rodgers.
Three touchdowns and 466 yards in the
playoffs is simply ridiculous.

Darren Sproles is the top utility man in
the NFL. The Chargers should have never
let him go. '

It is hard to tackle Pierre Thomas.

It is easyxto tackle anyone in the Fal-
cons’ backﬁeld.

_ The only thing you can make fun of Eli
Manning for is that dumbfounded expres-

, sion seemingly permanently plastered on

his face.

What to Look Forward To

If I were Baltimore (Houston’s next
opponent), I’d be very fearful of No. 23.
Foster looks like he has returned to prime
form after battling injuries all year, and
his 153 yards and two touchdowns on 23
carries Sunday was a message heard loud
and clear.

Tebow has proved his abilities are as
sporadic and inconsistent as anyone’s.
If he has a good day, that pass defense of

. New England will be introuble. Can it be

New York and Green Bay played in what
was probably the best regular season game
of the year in Week 13. Eli Manning is a sea-
soned vet now, and the Giants pose just as
big a threat to the Packers as anyone else.
Expect this game to be a brawl.

New Orleans looks incredibly hot,
and the 49ers are inexperienced in the
playoffs and haven’t been on the ﬁeld for
two weeks. I expect the Saints’ offense to
roll over a highly touted San Francisco
defense (unless the weather is extraordi-
narily poor). _

Her average has since decreased to 11.1
points per game, but Berenato attributes the
dip in scoring ‘— which the whole team has
experienced — to the higher caliber‘opposi—
tion that the team has faced of late-. .

g Following the guard’s concussion, Ber-
enato di_dn’t want to put pressure on Davis
to perform. “I think it’s still going take her
a second to get back in the swing of things,”
Berenato said after Davis’ 2-point performance
against Duke. , - '

Two games later against Valparaiso, Davis

1 led all scorers with 17 points, shooting 58.3

percent from the ﬁeld —— also a game high.
“This is Marquel’s welcome back game,”

Berenato said. “We now have Marquel back

like Marquel.” _ . y ,
Davis took her return to form in stride.

“I’ve been working hard to come back, so I '

I kind of needed to relax and let the game come

to me,” Davis said. “[I was] a little more conﬁ-
V dent coming into this than what I have been in
the recent games coming off of my concussion.
Iwas really prepared, and like I said, I’ve been
working a little extra to come back.”

Davis credits her older brother Marcus
with instilling’ in her a competitive drive at
a young age. “He was very competitive with
me,” she _said. “We would always compete in
basketball  We’d come home, we’d play,on'e'-
on-one and my dad would ref.”

“If he’d beat me, I’d get mad,” Davis added.
“He was a good help to my drive of being bet-.
ter, becausel always worked so hard to beat
him and demolish him when it came to.bas~
ketball.”

Last year as a freshman, Davis appeared
in 28 games, starting three. She averaged 2.3
points, 1.5 rebounds and 14.3 minutes per

‘game. With the team still winless in confer-~

ence play, Davis’ improvements will need to
continue if the Panthers hope to ﬁnd that
elusive victory. H ‘
