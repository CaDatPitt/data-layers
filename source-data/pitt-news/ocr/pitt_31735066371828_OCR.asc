Heyward lost to probation

By Mark A. Sindler
The Pitt News

For several months, he was indis- 2

putably one of the three most tal-
ented tailbacks recruited
nationwide. Last season, Craig
“Ironhead” Heyward did nothing to

dispell the rave reviews, leading the

Panthers in rushing (539 yards) and
all freshmen in receiving (70 yards).

Great things were expected of him
-— until last Wednesday. That day
Dr. Conney Kimbo, vice president
of student affairs, placed_Heyward
on disciplinary probation for one
year.

He can still attend classes but will
not perform for the Panthers in
1985.

Head coach Foge Fazio and his
administrative assistant, Alex Kra-
mer, yesterday said NCAA bylaws
permit them to redshirt Heyward
next season. He will be eligible 1986-
88.

Kimbo’s actions stem from a Feb.
27 Judicial Board hearing during
which a five-student panel recom-
mended five sanctions against Hey-
ward for his alleged attack on two
students with a crutch .Ian..22.

He had been accused of four
counts of breaking Pitt's code of
conduct.

Both sophomore Matthew Black
and freshman Stephan Hastings
reportedly suffered various) injuries
when a ﬁght erupted on the fifth
ﬂoor of Tower A during the early
morning hours.

The Pitt News further learned that
Black, a religious studies major,
plans to withdraw from the univer-
sity this week in the wake of the
January incident. Although he
could not be reached late last night,
Black is not expected to return any-
time soon.

In addition to disciplinary proba-

Creativity

tion, which prohibits Heyward from
participating in any university extra-
curricular activities during a one-
year period beginning March 6,
Kimbo applied other sanctions.

0 Full restitution of all non-
insured medical expenses. Black
said he suffered a facial gash requir-
ing 40 stitches as well as other injur-
ies. Hastings reportedly suffered a
broken right shoulder blade. Both
students required temporary
hospitalization.

0 Persona non grata status in the
dormitories. The code provides for
an unspecified time period, though
Heyward will be permanently
banned.

0 Scheduled interview with a psy-
chiatrist to determine whether
further counseling is required. If
necessary, Heyward would be under

a psychiatrist's supervision for
approximately one year.

0 One hour of community service
per week for one year.

If Heyward violates any of the lat-
ter three sanctions, he could face
automatic suspension, which
includes permanent expulsion from
the football team andno extracur-
ricular activities duri-ng his academic
stay. 3 .

The board had originally voted
4-1 to permanently expel Heyward
from Pitt. Further deliberations on
recommendations by the Office of
Residence Life resulted in the penal-
ties Kimbo eventually sanctioned.

Heyward.’s attorney found Kim-
bo’s ruling too harsh.

“[The board] never showed Craig
presented intent to hurt anybody,”

Pitt students 2

face high

By Jennifer Benzing
The Pitt News

According to a university news
release, Pitt students will face a min-
imum increase of 5 percent in tuition
next year, which will be higher if
Pitt’s administration does not get
the $103 million it argued for yester-
day when it appeared before the
House and Senate Appropriations
Committee in Harrisburg. The
release states that the administration
is asking for $12.4 million more than
was proposed by Gov. Thornburgh
for state universities in the l986 fis-
cal year. University president Wes-
ley Posvar said that Thornburgh’s
proposal “falls short of the needs of
these institutions.”

In response to the question of
what effects the tuition increase will
have on enrollment, the administra-
tion said that for the past 4 to 5
years, the state’s income has kept
pace with the increases (which have
increased 20 percent over the past
two years). ‘ ‘

er tuition

Posvar told the committee that
“over the past decade, the state’s
share of fiscal resources of the uni-
versity has declined from 34 percent
to 27 percent, while student tuition
has increased from from 22 percent
to 33 percent of total revenues. Stu-,
dent tuition can no longer be relied
upon to fund such a large percentage
of the university’s budget without
jeopardizing access for low- and
middle—income students.”

Posvar also suggested that the
funds used for the recruitment of
minorities be spent for programs to
prepare minorities for college,
rather than to compete with other
state schools for the same pool of
college-bound minorities.

Pitt is using a different budget
strategy this year, dividing the
appropriations. plea into two sepa-
rate categories, traditional funding
and line items. Traditional funding,
which includes general instruction
and public service, accounts for $7.1
million in the proposed budget,
while the line items account for the
remaining $7.3 million requested,
which is intended to solve growing
problems and meet new challenges.

heny County Port Authority.

According to a PAT news release,
PAT entertained two options in ser-
vice cuts earlier this year: a cut of 37
percent and a cut of eight percent.
The decision by the Port Authority
Board on March 7 to maintain ser-
vice at current levels rather than
implement cutbacks was based on
several important factors.

First, neither a 37-percent nor an
eight-percent cut in services could be
implemented before June 9 because
of necessary schedule changes and
retention of personnel. Also, neither
of the cutback options would have
enough impact "on the cash flow
problem to improve the budget of
the operation. Service reductions
would cause significant inconven-
ience to transit users without resolv-
ing PAT’s financial problems.

“The bottom line is that cuts
would not solve _the problem, just
delay it,” one PAT official said.

The Port Authority discussed a
proposal for revitalizing the transit
system at a meeting on Feb. 22. The
plan for revitalization focused on a
proposed transit tax.

According to the outline of the
proposal, the county commissioners
announced their support on Feb. 1
for a one-percent sales tax to_ gener-
ate revenue for the Port Authority.
Plans to implement this tax have not
been set.

day, PAT chairman James C. Rod-

creativitygets  

results for some students

By Susan Benedek
The Pitt News

Pitt student Cindy Berkovitz
really wants an internship with a
television production studio in New
York City. The internship is very
competitive. Cindy knows that the
key is to make an unforgettable
impression on the interviewer. So
Cindy walks into his office, extends
a firm handshake and presents her
resume — a neon yellow resume.

Today, rn_any~stud_ents like Cindy
are trying imaginative approaches
when they are entering the business
world.

“I'm not afraid to be different. My
resume essentially says ‘I'm here and
I want it,’ ” explained Cindy. “When
they pulled out that file on possible
interns, I wanted mine to stick out.”

However, Bob Perkoski from the
Placement Office warned that some
creative techniques may get a
student noticed, but the potential
employer may not like what he sees.

At the Placement Office, career

counselors recommend that
students present a conservative
image when applying for a job.
According to Perkoski, “Most of the
students at Pitt are conservative.
Those who try the really wild find
themselves unemployed, but then
there are exceptions."

One aggressive student, said Per-
koski, waited every morning at the
restaurants surrounding Oxford
Center in search of a businessman.
Upon finding one, he would buy him
breakfast. During breakfast they
would discuss employment oppor-
tunities.

Perkoski said another student
who was applying to a fast-food
chain presented his resume in the
shape of a hamburger.

Perkoski also has seen several
resumes that were printed like a
pyramid. The words were printed all
the way across at the bottom of the
page and tapered to a point at the
top of the page.

“The gist is, ‘I want to go to the
top,’ ” Perkoski said.

Elisse Kelberg, personnel coordi-
nator at Ketchum Advertising said:
“Once, this girl gave us a box like
those used at Chinese restaurants for

take-home orders. Inside, she had
strips of paper with her name and
address looped together in a chain.
In addition, she had a fortune cookie
with a note inside saying when she
would call for an interview.”

Another student who applied to
Ketchum, according to Kelber,
arranged her cover letter like the Ed
McMahon Sweepstakes: “You may
be the grand prize winner of a
million-dollar employee,” it read.

“Creativity is impressive, but we
hire based upon openings," Kelberg
said.

Bill Monroe from ALCOA said:
“We expect a very straightforward,
businesslike resume. If I were
looking for a creative writer or
something, then I might expect some
uniqueness. Even then, I wouldn’t
advise anyone to get too cute.”

Perkoski advises students not to
try things that deviate too much
from a professional image.
“Creativity in some instances may be
helpful, but something too wild can
be detrimental.”

Cindy Berkovitz, however, is one
person who tried the unusual and
succeeded; she got the internship.

Stool; e 4-1048

By Vicki Zeitner
The  News

In an effort to evaluate the

strengths and weaknesses of peace
movements in the United States,

’ four University of Pittsburgh pro-

fessors spoke at the Fourth PIP/
“Peace Links Workshop on Monday,
March 11, at the First Baptist
Church of Pittsburgh.

Professors participating were
Robert Colodny and Van Beck Hall
from the Department of History,
Thomas Kane from the Department
of Communication, and Richard
Cottam. of political science.

Colodny addressed the crowd of
65 on “Peace Movements in Antiq-
uity.” He quoted exerpts from the
writings of Euripedes and Tacitus,
who, in the days of the Athenian and
Roman empires, expressed grave
concern and protest toward the mil-
itant policies of their warring
republics.

According to Colodny, Euripedes
insightfully discerned a direct rela-
tionship between the policies of war
and those of repression. It was Euri-
pedes who said that “those who en-
slave to make war also enslave
women.”

Euripedes realized that lasting
peace could only be attained when
two conditions exist: the emancipa-
tion of women and of the lower
orders (classes). Colodny explained
that Euripedes has taught us that
“the policy of waging war cannot be
separated from domestic policy.”

Colodny then referred to the writ-

ing of the Tacitus, who said, “To
plunder  to steal is what they [the
Romans] call an empire. They create
a desert and call it peace.”
Colodny regretted that educa-
tional institutions no longer teach
the Greek classics. He feels that
L many of the writings of these early
thinkers address issues that are sur-

prisingly relevant to the problems of

modern conflicts and may provide

avenues of insight that we often.

‘To exemplify an ancient model
peacemaker, Colodny referred to
Asoka, who, by the sword, unified
what later became British India.
After converting to Buddhism,
Asoka immediately recalled his
armies and issued an edict that all
religious beliefs be respected. One of
the first peace policies pursued by
Asoka was the opening of all schools
to women. According to Colodny,
Asoka believed that women
deserved the same chance at enlight-
enment as men. Colodny summar-
ized Asoka’s beliefs, concluding that
“peace must have a social founda-
tion, a pacified community within
and social justice between genders.
Such a society will not go to war.”
_Ha1l discussed the history of re-
sistance to war in the United States
from the 1780s to the present. He
contended that “one of the basic
weaknesses of the peace movement
in the U-.S. is that there has never
really been a strong pacifistic ele-
ment [in the U.S.] with the exception
of various clerical orders."

‘Tis the season to be Irish! Yes,
once again, people throughout the
country will be donning the color
green, telling Irish jokes and drink-
ing gallons of green beer. It’s a day
when everyone wants to be Irish,
and people tend to accept such say-
ings as “kiss me, I’m Irish.”

Where’s the best place to be on St.
Patrick’s Day? At an Irish pub, of
course.

Pittsburgh has a great deal to
offer to people from any nationality,
and the Irish are no exception. Most
pubs —— or what we in America refer
to as bars —— that would normally be
closed on Sundays will remain open
in honor of St. Patrick’s Day.

Nearly every bar in Pittsburgh
will be promoting St. Patrick’s Day,
regardless of their national origin,
and will most likely be filled to
capacity following the parade on
Saturday. If you’re downtown for
the parade, check out the following
places for authentic Irish cuisine and
atmosphere.

Mick McGuire’s, located at

The Pitt News, Wednesday, March 13, 1985

Some Irish pubs

Market Square, is perhaps the clos-
est one can get to actually being in
Ireland. Despite the fact that the
owner has no real Irish blood, he has
managed to bring a small section of
Ireland to Pittsburgh. The menu
offers diners generous portions of
Irish and American meals, including
the old standard, Irish stew, and the
bar offers the regular customers a
place to hang their mugs (complete
with McGuire’s emblem on them)
and enjoy scenes of Ireland through
pictures, antiques and even an Irish
flag that hangs above the door to
join the personable staff in welcom-
ing in-comers. The service is quite
friendly and quick, and the atmos-
phere is rather pleasant.

Across the Square, one can find
Gallagher’s, an honest-to-goodness

-Irish pub complete with an Irish

owner. Irish music is piped in on the
stereo for customers as they enjoy
such beverages as Guiness Stout and
Harp’s Lager — the “authentic”
Irish brews.

For the utmost in authenticity,
however, the Irish Centre of Pitts-
burgh will be holding an entire even-
ing of celebrating, beginning with a
mass in Gaelic at 5 p.m. The mass
will be followed by an Irish dinner,
complete with vegetable soup, ham

more Irish than others

and cabbage, (which is actually the
real Irish dish, not corned beef as
many are lead to believe), green
beans, potatoes, Irish soda bread
and tea. After dinner entertainment
will be provided by the Irish Step
Dancers —- girls ranging in ages
from 6-19 years old, a few of whom
have been offered the opportunity to
appear in Ireland. The evening will
end with a dance, featuring radio
personality Mike Folan playing

recorded Irish music, and Meg
Goughan, with live Irish music. The
cost of the entire evening, including
dinner, show and the dance is just
$15 for non-members, and after 9
p.m., the price will be $7 with tea and
Irish soda bread still being offered.
The Irish Centre is located on 6886
Forward Ave.

If you're willing to go a little
further to find the Irish spirit, the

Blarney Stone Restaurant, located
on 30 Grant Ave. in Etna, is the
place to be. The Blarney Stone,
which is backed by the Irish Centre
of Pittsburgh, will be offering spe-
cials and entertainment throughout

the weekend. The Blarney Stone
offers not only an Irish restaurant
and pub, but also the Tara shop,
which features gift items from the
“Land of the Green.”

said Allan Sodomsky, a third-year
Pitt law student. “That's a very
important element to a crime. In our
society we don’t punish people who
don’t have two elements: the act and
the intent. Without those two, you
don't have anything.”

Sodomsky contended that when
the panel was instructed by the hear-
ing coordinator, intent was not an
issue. Assistant vice president of stu-
dent affairs Dr. Dennis Donham
presided over the near I3-hour
hearing.

“Donham told the jury you don’t
have to find intent,” Sodomsky said.

happened.

When contacted yesterday, Don-
ham did not refuse to discuss aspects
of the case, but declined to comment
publicly.

Phil Fabiano, the prosecuting
attorney who’s also a third-year law
student, was similarly reticent.

Admitting “the sanctions [don’t]
fit the offense,” Fabiano declined to
comment any further.

Although Sodomsky praised
Donham for his supervising of the
day-long hearing — “he had a diffi-
cult job, and he handled it well, but I
don’t agree with him on this point”
— he faulted the board for failing to

prove intent.

“To this day, no one‘s found Craig
Heyward intended to do the dam-
age,” Sodomsky noted.

He also added, “It's unfortunate
injuries occurred. However, that
fact exists. There’s no denying that.
The hearing was for the sole purpose
of how to treat Craig Heyward.
There’s no way the injuries were
going to be mitigated or taken away.

“So now you're faced with the
problem of treating him. How do
you punish somebody who didn't
mean what he did? So when you ask,
‘Were we going for acquittal,’ we
were attempting to see justice done."

The Meaning of Deception

By now the American farmers understand the meaning
of the word deception. Granting the Republican party a
hearty endorsement in President Reagan’s. re-election,
midwestern farmers voted for the opportunity to take a
leading role in the country’s economic recovery, provided
their interests were protected. To the nation‘s farmbelt,
however, as to the president, an economic recovery
means different things. To American farmers, as to many
other Americans, recovery means low inﬂation, a healthy
rate of employment and a high rate of production and
exportation of American-made goods and produce. To
the president, though, recovery means a high dollar value
abroad and a large sacrifice at home.

Now faced with the increasing inability to receive badly
needed loans for spring planting and an uncertain future
for what has traditionally been one of the world's largest
agricultural producers, American farmers are learning a
hard lesson in presidential rhetoric.

Senator Robert Dole, as quoted by the Associated
Press in Washington, was right on target when he said,
“Most of what the farmers have heard lately is pure
politics.” To cite one example, President Reagan inferred
that it’s too late in the season to assist debt-ridden
farmers with a credit relief package. It is obvious that the
president understands little about the farm belt and its
production cycle. Without some credit relief now,
farmers cannot obtain necessary loans to secure spring
crops.

Politicizing the issue cannot extend far beyond the
linkage of the agricultural relief bill with budget deficits.
White House spokesman Larry Speakes arrogantly chal-
lenged Congress to “talk about deficit reduction, not
budget-busting." The fact of the matter is that Congress
has consistently attempted to reasonably approach the
problem of the deficit, though through an avenue the
administration refuses to consider -— reductions in mil-
itary spending. Speakes’comment is merely an attempt to
blame the budget problem on congressional Democrats
who prefer bread to bombs.

Reagan charged that “someone in Washington must be
responsible.” Unfortunately for the farmers, the presi-
dent has chosen to exempt himself from this responsibil-
ity. It is blatantly hypocritical for a politician who molds
his campaign platform on tradition to ignore the devas-
tating problems facing one of America’s traditional
strengths, a thriving agricultural base.

Some Equivo-
cation

Zachary Grayson’s cartoonishly
shrill letter last week calling for an
“unequivocal condemnation" (he
used that phrase four, count ’em,
four times) of the BAS’ attempt to
bring Louis Farrakhan to campus
was predictable enough. Trying to
choke anti-Semitic. or purported
anti-Semitic individuals, groups and
ideas from infecting the public is an
accepted post-holocaust strategy
among the Jews.

Well, let me throw some equivo-
cation into the matter. I strongly
believe that having Farrakhan
speak, contrary to Grayson’s claim,
would serve a purpose. It would
allow everyone, particularly us
Jews, to hear firsthand this dema-
gogue’s racist vitriol. Some may
agree with or be indifferent to his
ideas, but that is the risk we take in a
pluralistic and open society.

Reading about someone’s anti-
Semitism is not the same as seeing it
blazing at you from a stage. It is like
a sobering slap in the face, but a
necessary one if a sincere and signifi-
cant “condemnation of anti-
Semitism and racism” is to be
attempted. This country, as it has
demonstrated with the Nazis in Sko-
kie (ill.) and in other places, does not
allow racism to be combatted by
suppression and censorship, only
education and awareness. Grayson’s
rash and cowardly approach is cer-
tainly not the answer.

One of the least talked about, cer-
tainly by the Jews, factors responsi-
ble for the holocaust is delusion. The
delusion of so many who refused to
recognize the impending death and
destruction that was breathing down
their necks. Had they looked into
the belly of the beast that early on
had them all but digested, they could
have possibly gotten out in time. But
itjust wasn't real enough. Louis Far-
rakhan is real, and should be seen.

Adam Eisenstat

Freedom of speech

As the programming chairman of
the Black Action Society, i feel com-
pelled to respond to the March ll
letter to the editor written by Zach-
ary L. Grayson, who feels that an
appearance made by Rev. Louis
Farrakhan at Pitt would serve no
purpose and should be disallowed.
Mr. Grayson, before you cause the
telephone lines to jam and before
you send the entire Jewish student

population beating down the doors
of the Black Action Society, I feel it
is necessary that you understand the
purpose of the BAS, which is to ful-
fill the needs of the constituency.

Certain statements and views of
Mr. Farrakhan have often been dis-
torted and misquoted by the press
and the news media. We feel that not
only our constituency, but Mr.
Grayson and our fellow Jewish
brothers and sisters should have a
chance to hear exactly what Mr.
Farrakhan’s stance is concerning
certain issues. We, the members of
the Black Action Society, have not
taken a stance on the views of Mr.
Farrakhan. We would not blindly
support or condemn someone with-
out knowing exactly what he has to
say. That’s why this proposed lec-
ture would be a knowledgeable one
for everyone concerned.

BAS’ interest in Rev. Farrakhan
is not spontaneous. During the last
two Black Weeks, a poll was taken
revealing that a large portion of the

gundergraduate black population

wants to hear what Mr. Farrakhan
has to say. Serving as a precedent,
and with whom we have been in con-

Speak Out
Against War

Nicaragua is a viable, independ-
ent country, and if we as Americans
don’t speak out against the war that
America is subtending there, we will
be part of the process that compels
this violence.

Reagan's national security poli-
cies are not meant to protect free-
dom. The Nicaraguans overthrew a
corrupt, American-backed dictator
(Somoza) to achieve a more just
society. Their actions are intended
to quell the fire that rightly burns in
much of Central and South
America.

is it any wonder that the people
whose second-class status allows a
powerful country to practice terror-
istic tactics and double standards
against them would be embittered‘?
“Gringo go home," then, is a phrase
that should reach an understanding
in us as Americans and human
beings.

The alternatives to this war in the

region are many and only limited by
those who propose and accept them.
Our role, although being acted upon
by a militaristic administration, is
heavily understated. Our duty as
individuals is the making of deci-
sions -— based upon relatively inde-
pendent data — as to the ways and
means, to what ends and for what
reasons our actions (or actions
through lack of action) take.

Just societies are made up of intel-
ligent people who make their own
decisions based on a stricter set of
facts, not rhetoric. These people can
rise above even cultural norms of
behavior instead of being bound to a

certain mode of thought. Although i

it seems quite true that we have free
will, that will is forged and tempered
by the society in which we find our-
selves. Individuals then have a better
view ofthis world we live in and have
even more power to determine our
own collective future.

Fifth Anniversary

March 14 is the fifth anniversary
of the death of a courageous individ-
ual, Allard K. Lowenstein, and he
should be remembered. He will go
down in history as probably the sin-
gle most important person in stop-
ping the Vietnam War.

Lyndon Johnson appeared invin-
cible to most practical politicians in
1968, but Lowenstein knew of the
widespread anti-war sentiment that
could be turned against an incum-
bent president. He convinced
Eugene McCarthy to run against
Johnson as a peace candidate and
changed the face of American politi-
cal history by having the courage to
follow his convictions. Robert
Kennedy, who spurned Lowen-
stein’s advice until after Johnson
dropped out of the race, honored
him with a quote from Emerson:
“That if a single man plant himself
on his convictions and there abide,
the huge world will come round to
him."

Lowenstein was more than just a
one-time peace activist, though. He
served in Congress for a term, fight-
ing for progressive causes. He was
involved in civil rights through the
Student Non-violent Coordinating
Committee and in the leadership of
Martin Luther King Jr.'s Southern
Christian Leadership Conference
long before it was popular or even
widely recognized as an important
endeavor. At his own personal risk,
he helped to smuggle political refu-
gees out of fascist Spain and South
Africa.

Letters to the Editor

continued from page four

It is ironic that Lowenstein died
from an assailant using a handgun
while he was in the middle ofa cam-
paign for stronger federal gun con-
trol laws. It is not surprising that he
was unsuccessful, however, partly
because of the wide range of his
activities. But as The New York
Times eulogized, he “was a gallant
crusader for a hundred causes, some
of them lost, but none of them
ignoble."

Senator Edward I(ennedy’s epi-
taph at his burial stated: “All by
himself, he was more effective than
an organization of hundreds. He

was a one-man demonstration for

civil rights; even when he walked
alone, he was a multitude marching
for peace. He had a gentle passion
for the truth.”

We would all do well to emulate
such a life. The world is a sorrier
place without him.

Panhandlers

Though we decry the practice of
writing opinions or items as a result
of seeing others’ work, at times such
observations open an entire window
in a mind. Dirk Kaufman’s “A Dol-
lar ...” in The Pitt News certainly will
open every mind about similar expe-
riences with people who come up to
one on a street and ask for alms.

In America, beggars are called
panhandlers. While the man in
Kaufman's tale used all the tech-
niques of a pro, there is no way to be
sure. Only those of us who have had
the experience of having the same
person come up on various occa-
sions and ask for money know for
sure what we are facing.

Panhandlers may be dealt with in
many ways. It depends on the per-
sonality of the one being asked. If a
story is involved, some givers wait to
hear it and gauge the amount to be
given by how good they thought the
story was. Was it moving, etc‘? An
excellent dodge is to hurry by with-
out giving any notice to the mendi-
cant. A common practice is to
present a small amount to him.

In the case of persons asking for a
specific amount, like 71 cents, it may
be advisable to offer a quarter and
suggest getting more from others.

Like, I give you 25 cents, B gives 25
cents, now you'll need only 21 cents
more — unless you are of scientific
bent, in which event you will begin
to wonder what bus ever charged 7l
cents. They were 75 cents before
being raised to a dollar.

One of our colleagues was asked
for 55 cents. He quickly pulled out a

quarter and suggested that maybe
the asker could get the rest else-
where. The asker refused the quarter
and became somewhat emotional.
He needed the amount he asked for,
and so on. Now our brain guy gets
out the rest of his change and counts
out the 55 cents. He said, if it's that
important, I'll give it to you. It is
accepted. The two go their separate
ways.

Unquestionably, when the right
emotions are touched, anyone of
normal bent will try to help another
in need. However, strangers who
approach people on the street are
only going to get results from the
young and/or naive. Any adult who
has done much walking will have
countless tales similar to Kaufman's.
Knowledgeable ones will tell about
the large numbers of winos who
want money for booze, though they
cannot use that plea. They say, “Can
you let me have a quarter for a bowl
of soup?"

Kaufman told his true story about
a “crying man.” We'll end our item
with a true incident.

A man who walked about the
streets of downtown years ago met a
panhandler who kept himself neat
and sober who said he was hoping to
get work in the city. He’d come from
the Midwest. Our man gave him
some change. They continued to
cross paths —— maybe once a month.
Each time, they would chat a bit. As
they prepared to part, our man
would hand the pro a bit of change.
He had not asked after the first
meeting.

Months, a year went by. Our man
was not going into town. He lived in
another section. He had lost his
income, hoping things would
happen and he could get back to a
job and some spending money.
Spring brought the usual better
days, shedding of winter clothing.
Our man was even inclined to veri-
ture back to town and his favorite
haunts.

On a familiar corner, a familiar
figure approached. “Could you help
a fella out? I’m here from the Mid-
west, hoping to get a job in your
great city.”

“Hello,” our man said with relish.
“Remember me? I use to talk to you
when I saw you about a year ago.
Well, I’ve got some news for you.
I've been out of work. Just about
broke. You and I are in the same
boat now.” ’

The bum began to walk away: “I
don’t have time to hear the story of
your life. I’ve got business to attend
to.”

Off he went to attend to his busi-
ness, which was begging off his fel-
low man.

Medicine is rowdy again

Here at Pitt, we've become
almost accustomed to the steady
flow of announcements of new
medical procedures and break-
throughs in lifesaving opera-
tions. Friday’s Pitt News. for
example, carried front-page sto-
ries of the artificial heart contro-
versy and the new microsurgery
for hypertension by Dr. Janetta
et al. at Presby. Now medical
headlines from aroundthe coun-
try report developments from
such cities as Louisville, Tuscon,
Miami, Lorna Linda and San
Francisco.

But these stories -— some of
them uplifting, some ofthem dis-
turbing -— and the discussion
and debate they cause are surely
a good thing and a signal that
medicine is going through a
healthy period of growing pains.
Medicine is rowdy again.

In Pittsburgh, sadly, the latest
heart-liver transplant recipient
died, and in Louisville, artificial
heart recipients have faced set-
backs in their recoveries. Per-
haps more unfortunate still for
the rest of the population was a
wave of pessimistic reports that
immediately surfaced from
government agencies, and even
some medical authorities, calling
for reviews and reconsiderations
of the new procedures.

Both of these new procedures
have been attempted only three
times. Liver transplants would
never be at the point they are
now had Starzl, his collaborators
and all oftheir early patients not
persevered through those hard,
early years of minimal success
back in Denver. If no one even
attempts these operations, they
have no chance of developing
into accepted therapeutic
techniques.

To demand success after only
two operations is absurd. The
FDA and other controlling
organizations are to blame for
many of these roadblocks to
development due to their often
counter-productive restrictions.
Great numbers of Americans
continue to suffer while the FDA
bottles up new procedures in
their attempt to protect the first
few patients.

It is widely agreed that if peni-
cillin were discovered today, it
almost certainly would never
pass the FDA‘s battery of tests

and certifications. The first two
patients to try penicillin back in
Britain in the l930s died. It took
some time before the bugs were
worked out, but there is clearly
no possible measure of the bil-
lions of lives saved by penicillin
and related antibiotics.

The terrible possibility exists
that the cure for many diseases
such as cancer may be lying at the
bottom of a pile of FDA rejects.
The FDA‘s stringent testing
(along with tests from West Ger-
many and Europe) did nothing
to prevent the terrible thalido-
mide tragedy. The final testing is
always an unsure event, yet at
some time, they must be tried on
the first patient.

There surely will be low survi-
val rates at first. The early liver
survival rates were abysmal.
But we can’t forget that life is the
most important thing in the
world.

As transplants advance, there
is more and better information
available for the families. They
can better decide what it will be
like during the years of hardship
and setbacks to come. But when
nothing is more important to
them than life itself, we must
understand that new techniques,
along with their problems and
setbacks, must be tried on some
patient, or none will live.

The history of “first surgeries’
is as fascinating as it is important
to our perspective on new tech-
niques. For example, in I933,
Dr. Charles Doan had a four-
year-old female patient dying of
hemolytic anemia. Doan took
the daring step of performing the
first spleenectomy. Presumably,
he justified his radical treatment
on the basis of what was then
merely conjecture —~ that the
spleen destroys red cells, and that
a human could still thrive with-
out a spleen. The little girl recov-
ered, and so did many others
who otherwise certainly would
have died.

In Tuscon, the story of Tho-
mas Creighton brought up some
entirely new problems and cap-
tured the imagination of the
whole country. I believe the doc-
tors did the right thing when they
defied the FDA rules to keep
their patient alive until another
heart was found.

I think the case is straightfor-

O

ward here and almost borrowed
entirely from the script of the
movie “ThreshoId.“ This was
indeed considered to be one of
the primary initial applications
of the plastic" heart, keeping a
patient alive until a suitable
donor could be found. If I were
dying, rejecting a transplanted
heart, I know I would want the
doctors to try the artificial heart,
try whatever they could. This is a
basic principle of health care that
can too often get covered up by
FDA rules and quotas.

On the other side of the coin,
we have the recent tragic deaths
in San Francisco. An elderly nun
and a 60-year-old woman
recently died of AIDS con-
tracted from contaminated
blood products during routine
operations. For me, the problem
is that San Francisco is not mov-
ing fast enough to protect its citi-
zens by speeding up implementa-
tion of the new screens being
developed. The FDA must first
approve the screens for AIDS,
hepatitis-B, etc. Then the blood
banks must set up the new
procedures.

Blood bank people are often
the heroes behind the scenes in
operations like the liver trans-
plants where you can go through
a hundred units of blood. Still, it
is wrong to publicly criticize the
reasonable concern and appre-
hensionﬁust as it is unconsciona-
ble to suggest that we should not
worry or try to change things
because it is statistically unlikely
that you will catch AIDS or
hepatitis.

The technology is at the point
of being able to screen the blood
for AIDS, etc., but the blood
banks and the agencies need that
extra push to get the lead out and
start using these tests as a matter
of routine procedure. Admit-
tedly, they are not proven yet,
but again, we have to start some-
where, and only then can the
screens become more reliable.

The best thing we can do is to -
push for answers by asking these
questions. Medicine is a grow-
ing, changing science, partly
because of the vital input and
interaction of an informed,
active public.

Hall noted that in the middle of
the 19th century, “secular peace
movements emerged along with the
denominational groups which, in
time, developed an increment of
strength." However, Hall said that
as a political movement, “it has been
relatively weak."

He also said that an essential
point often ignored by history books
is that “in practically every case in
which the U.S. found itselfin a war,
there have been movements to end
those wars or to punish the individu-
als” and politicians held responsible
for military action.

However, the strength behind
them has not always been pacifistic.
“Political resistance," Hall
explained, “has taken many differ-
ent forms, though it generally has
not been founded on pacifistic
grounds.”

According to Hall, “Wars that
began with overwhelming support
resulted in voter desertion of the
party that entered the country into
war.” He cited various examples
that dishonored the Democratic
Party, such as the Civil War, World
War II and the Korean and Vietnam

 the ‘Pitt News. Wedinesdayv, ‘March 13. .1985

explores hope for world peace

Wars.

Hall pointed out a number of
problems with partisan political
responses to war. He said that
“many times, the replacement
[party] isjust as willing to use force.”

“Peace movements in America are
mostly responses after a war be-
gins," he continued. Pressure should
be brought on politicians “before
decisions are made that throw us
into a military situation."

Kane discussed the ways language
serves to perpetuate, characterize
and continue cold war policies. “By
and large,” he said, “public rigidity
over the assumptions [inherent to
cold war strategy] remain.”

Kane charged that a peace move-
ment must primarily “pierce the lan-
guage and rhetorical symbols which
appeal to the beliefs and conven-
tional wisdoms of the general public.

“These rhetorical symbols,” he
continued, “have the ability to over-
come all of the inconsistencies of
reality. They embody a set of atti-
tudes and perceptions to be
appealed to in a time of great need."

He claimed that politicians have

rhetorical symbols at their disposal
to cover inconsistencies in policy.
These symbols serve to dampen
intelligent discussion and dissent.

“The concept of national secur-
ity,” he said, “was a term rarely
referred to before I945. Now, it is
the ultimate term to end discussion
and debate.”

Kane said political officials claim
that national security is at stake to
gain public support: “National
security is elastic. It can be confined
or stretched, depending on the needs
of the speaker. He is master who can
define.

“The symbol of national security
is an enemy of any peace move-
ment,” he continued. “We need to
understand that the Soviet Union
doesn’t have a monopoly on evil,
just as the United States doesn’t
have a monopoly on good."

Cottam, the last to speak before
members of the gathering broke up
into small groups, said, “We have
allowed military technocrats to
determine the agenda of the peace
movements. Nearly all of the promi-
nent military personnel today share
basic assumptions that can be easily

spelled out.”

Fascism, Cottam believed, is a
dangerous possibility in this coun-
try. “A real fascist model has
recurred in Iran. When compared
with America, the parallels are
astonishingly close. We see the same
electric appeal to virtually the same
kind of people, the same words and
the same blaming of it all on the
devil. It follows from this that there
is only one way to stop people like
this, and that is to establish
superiority.”

He suggested that once the peace
movement gains superior authority,
“they’ll be willing to sit down with us
because they don’t want to drain all
their resources in an ongoing war.”

Fora successful strategy to influ-
ence foreign policy, Cottam advised
“not to get caught up with technical
problems of the MX.” He suggested
that such technical information —
the scientific basis and statistical
data about atomic weaponry — be
left to those who operate with tradi-
tional assumptions.

Instead, he suggested, “Focus on
exchange. Read politics. Read his-
tory. If you begin with_personal, cul-

tural exchange, there is virtually no
political risk.”

“The Green Party is a good politi-
cal mode,” Cottam claimed. “The
dual concern of environment and
peace is exactly what we need.
Essentially, you have to become a
strong interest group and tap into
the enormous receptivity of what
you are doing and make it real.”

In conclusion, Cottam asked,
“Why did we have a strong peace
movement that collapsed the day of
George McGovern’s defeat?”

He inferred that the intellectuals
have lost heart: “I cannot under-
stand, with the sense of unease that
is prevalent in this country, why peo-
ple cannot be mobilized.”

Peace Links — Women Against
Nuclear War is a growing network
of women nationwide who are lead-
ing families, clubs and communities
in activities that will help prevent
nuclear war. The organization is
founded on the belief that, in a
democracy, the people share respon-
sibility for determining public pol-
icy. Only the citizenry can establish
the priority of ending the nuclear
threat and cause political leaders to
find alternatives to escalation.

Learning Skills Center provides opportunity

By Jim Hohman
The Pitt News

Jessie Thomas, a 28-year-old
CGS computer science major,
stands at the board, scanning the
classroom for a raised hand. “All
right,” she asks, “did anyone have
difficulties with this factoring prob-
lem?" No one raises his hand, but
looks of confusion are on the faces
of many of the students in Thomas‘
Math 703A problem-solving ses-
sion. She proceeds to go over the
problem, asking questions after each
step."

Mike Ryan, a 20-year-old CAS
chemistry major, prepares for an
appointment with a student seeking
help in study skills. The student
knocks on the wall of Ryan's cubi-
cle. Ryan invites him in. The student
throws his knapsack down on the

, table and exclaims, “I have three

midterms and I can't get motivated
to study, but l’ve got to or I'll fail!"
Ryan tells him to relax, and over the
course of the hour, the two discuss
different ways of dealing with test
anxiety and studying for exams.

Thomas and Ryan are peer

helpers in the Learning Skills Cen-
ter. One is a math undergraduate
teaching assistant and the other a
student academic counselor.

Being a math UTA entails holding
two one-hour problem-solving ses-
sions per week for Math 3A, 3B,
703A or 703B; attending a supervi-
sory meeting; holding office hours
twice weekly and grading home-
work. SACS conduct six-week study
skills workshops that meet two
hours weekly and hold two to four
office hours per week for individual
counseling. 2

The SAC program started soon
after the creation of the Learning
Skills Center in 1974 when it became
apparent that Susan Schiller and
Georgine Materniak, the present
coordinator, could not meet the stu-
dent demand for study skills coun-
seling. A program was set up to train
undergraduates to conduct work-
shops at the center. It rapidly grew,
due in part to student interest and
support and in part to a grant
received from the Exxon Educa-
tional Foundation.

Dr.‘B.H. Crossman, Director

Counselors‘ interest in mathemat-
ics and math anxiety led to the devel-
opment of special math workshops
at the center. This in turn strength-
ened the Learning Skills Center's
ties to the math department.
Because there were not enough grad-
uate math TAs, problem-solving
sessions for Math 3A and 3B were
created to be taught by peer helpers
from the center.

Both programs have been very
successful.

According to Rosalind Jones,
who supervises the SAC program,
one of the primary reasons the study
skills program is a success is that
“the study skills techniques intro-
duced are new to most college stu-
dents, who in high school were never
taught how to learn." -

Relevance is another important
aspect. “The material can't help but
improve your studying skills,” com-
mented Barbara Schiffhauer, a
sophomore SAC. “And that is help-
ful come finals week.”

Finally, both Jones and Schiff-
hauer agreed that the student-to-
student relationship is important.
“The student can relate to [the SAC]
because both are in the same situa-
tion,” explained Schiffhauer.

And according to Jones, “When
possible, the student academic coun-
selor is assigned to work with stu-
dents having problems in [classes]
both have studied, so the SAC can
identify with the student’s
problems.”

Jones sees one measure of the suc-
cess of the SAC program in the fact
that some of the students who attend
the study skills workshops return
and apply for SAC positions.

Dr. Beverly'Michael, who teaches
Math 3A, cited the peer relationship
as a major factor behind the effec-
tiveness of the UTA program.

“There is more student involve-
ment in the learning process,” she
said, commenting that a 300-student
lecture does not lend itself to student

participation. “The UTAS act more '

like tutors, not instructors, and
that’s important because that’s what
you need in a recitation.” She added

that the UTAs’ study skills training
and constant supervision allow cer-
tain problems and problem-solving
techniques to be emphasized and
explained in depth.

Ann Massey, the math specialist
at the center and the UTA program
supervisor, feels that the friendly,
relaxed atmosphere of the problem-
solving sessions makes students
more at ease about asking questions.
“The one comment most often made
on the end-of-the-term UTA evalua-
tions by students is that the UTA
demonstrated concern for his/ her
students."

Beverly Moss, a graduate student
assistant who assists Massey in
organizing and supervising the
UTAs, noted that students are moti-
vated to avail themselves of the
UTA's assistance and office hours.
The problem-solving session is
counted as only 17 percent of the
final grade, but the recitation assis-
tance can be instrumental in suc-
ceeding in the class.

Both the UTA and SAC programs
require a commitment of time and
enthusiasm from the UTA or SAC.
Such a commitment is not without
its reward, however.

Schiffhauer and former UTA
Amy Greenberg agreed _that the
experience was helpful in making
plans to become education majors.
“It was a good preparation for stu-
dent teaching," said GreenE:Tg'._'ArEl
Materniak said that consistently,
former UTAS and SACS have
reported that peer helping did have a
positive effect on the job offers they
received or getting accepted into
graduate school.

Personal satisfaction is another
benefit. On a survey that inquired as
to how the UTAs benefited from
working in the Learning Skills Cen-
ter, one UTA replied: “There is
really a tremendous feeling when
I've helped someone. For example,
when I handed back the last test, one
girl who had been having trouble
and with whom I had worked came
up to me right then in front of eve-
rybody to thank me. She was so
excited, and it just made my day.”

  Panthers open second season tomorrow

Choz PaIla/ The Pitt News
Demetreus Gore

. Divers

provide the

difference

By Jace Palmer
The Pitt News

When_the Pitt men’s swimming
and diving team ended its season this
past weekend by taking the Eastern
Swimming and Diving League
Championships at Cleveland.State
over nine other teams, little was real-
ized concerning the contribution the
divers actually made to the victory.

By defeating archrival West Vir-
ginia by the score of 780-690, the
Panthers avenged a four-year string
of losses to the Mountaineers. Out
of Pitt’s total score, the divers con-
tributed l5l points — the West Vir-
ginia divers had none.

The turning point occurred on
Thursday in the one-meter competi-
tion. This was the first diving event
of the day, with Pitt’s team down by
39,points. However, by taking first,
third, fourth and fifth in the one-
meter, the divers’ scores brought the
Panthers from the 39-point deficit to
a 42-point advantage.

“Our performance on the one-
meter board was terribly demoraliz-
ing to the opposition,“ explained
diving coach Julian Krug. “Simply
put, our entire squad did an out-
standing job. All our individuals
came through in the clutch when it
counted.”

This could be termed an under-
statement. In taking first in the one-
meter dive, junior Todd Mulzet set a
new Eastern Intercollegiate record
for his performance.

Sophomore Jack Shuten placed
second in the three-meter dive and
finished fifth in the_o_ne-meter event.
Rounding out the Panther per-
formers were juniors Mike‘ McCal-

The question of whether or not student-
athletes should revert to athletes rs

By Mark A. Sindler
The Pitt News

Creepy thoughts entered Roy
Chipman’s mind yesterday. He
remembers traveling to Orlando,
Fla., in December. He recalls play-
ing Florida State there.

Then he flinches at the thought of
the Panthers blowing a 15-point lead
before bowing out 83-76. No less
than four different players were in
foul trouble by early in the second
half.

Chipman insists that the domino
effect could not surface nowadays —
even if he did compare the Semi-
noles to Pitt’s next opponent,
Louisiana Tech. The Bulldogs (27-2)
and Panthers (17-ll) clash tomor-
row at 3:30 p.m. in the first round of
the Midwest Regionals.

“That’s the kind of team that‘s big
and strong, throwing the ball down
the middle,” Chipman said, looking
at the game to be played at Oral
Roberts’ Mabee Center in Tulsa,
Okla.

As has been par for his team’s late-
season course, Chipman is still
undecided on his center —— someone
who can match the Bulldogs’ inside.‘

Either Andre Williams or Matt
Miklasevich will start. Their task is
unenviable: Neutralize fifth-year
senior Willie Simmons (6-ll center
with 55 blocks) and hold Karl “Mail-
man” Malone below his 16.3 ppg.‘

Interestingly, Chipman also

‘admitted yesterday thatjunior Keith

Armstrong, previously laid off, will
see considerable time.

“There’s no hangup,” Chipman
said, dispelling the theory that he’s
stuck among three fabulous pivot-A
men. “We just know nobody there
has proven he’s a full-time player.

a Right now it comes down to who’s

most effective. No matter who
starts, they’ll all play.”
Miklasevich, the 6-7, 235-lb.
nemesis, has started the last two
games. He doesn’t amaze statisti-
cally, only physically. Meantime,
Williams has scored 2l points and
grabbed 16 boards in the last two
games. He hasn't performed better
all season. As for Armstrong, he’s
faded considerably since withering

to Harvard this weekend.

Jack Schuten displays the form that earned him a trip

ley (fourth on the one-meter, sixth
on the three—meter) and Mark
McCormick (third on the one-
meter, eighth on the three-meter).

Coach Krug will take his divers to
Harvard to compete on Friday and
Saturday. The meet will determine
the chances of Pitt's divers in mak-
ing the NCAAs which will be held in
Texas at the end of March.

“It's looking pretty good at this

point,” said Krug. “If we perform up
to our potential, it should go well for
us.”

If the divers do as well as they're
feeling, they should have little diffi-
culty, as the team spirit has been
very optimistic at practice this week.

“We’re feeling great right now,“
echoed Mulzet and McCalley.

“I really hope to go to nationals,"
Mulzet added.

in the Georgetown debacle (70-46)
Feb. 19. V

The rest of the lineup stays the
same as it has been the last four
games.

“It gives me the feeling as a coach
that if you don't play hard, you don't
play,” Chipman said of his shufﬂe
following Feb. 19. “And that gives
me a good feeling. It gives me the
confidence that if the kids are play-
ing hard and if you have to take
them out, someone’s there to take
the place as well.”

Surrounding forward Charles
Smith (15.2 ppg, 8.2 rpg) are coun-
terpart Darryl Shepherd (6.1, 2.9)
and a backcourt of Joey David and
Demetreus Gore (50 assists, second).

Hidden among the numbers is
Gore's success as point guard when
Chipman employs a l-3-l zone
defense. It is a ploy he will certainly
throw at “probably one of the most
powerful players in the country,”
Karl Malone.

At the same time, Chipman
refuted what Tech coach Andy
Russo termed the Bulldogs’ forte.

Russo quietly takes

Tech to Top 10 ranking

By Mark A. Sindler
The Pitt News

, Andy Russo, only 30 at the time,
wanted a challenge. He was a bas-
ketball coach without a title to prove
it, a Yankee in Dixieland looking for
the “ins” his brother-in-law said
were plentiful. ‘

He was — ambitiously —growing
restless. Coaching thatjunior col-
lege in Carthage,.Texas became too
much a routine.

Enter a school one state over:
Louisiana Tech, its men’s basketball
team stagnating, became increas-
ingly disenchanted with Coach J.D.
Barnett — personal differences,
poor communication, zero results.

The wheels started churning. Bar-
nett and Tech parted ways in 1979.
Its loss was Virginia Common-
wealth’s gain.

In the meantime, Russo took the
initiative and sounded them out. So
did Tech, in contacting him. A con-
summation came in May 1979, and
Andy Russo was now a big-time
coach.

He only had six basketball
players. ’

“When we came in, it was pretty
rough," Russo said Monday after-
noon. “To be honest, a lot ofplayers
decided to leave before J.D. did.
They were decent players, pretty
good, but there weren't any young
players.

“But I always said if things were
good here, I'd never be hired.”

Apparently Tech couldn't have
made a wiser decision. Russo com-
piled a 130-54 (.600) record in six
years. Tomorrow at 3:30 p.m., he
defends a 27-2 record against the
Panthers (I7-l I) in a Midwest

Regional contest.

The site, Oral Roberts’ Mabee
Center in Tulsa, is a short four-hour
jaunt from Ruston, La. ,

In contrast, the rise to Division I
prominence has been long and diffi-
cult — especially on turf shared by
the Lady Techsters, once twn:time
national champions.

“Being from the north, moving to

the south, I had a hard time adjust-.

ing to that,” Russo, now 36, said.
“The second year we had a good

team [20- I0]. I was kind of used to it; ~

as long as the president and adminis-
tration are believers in athletics, you
really can't let that bother you. You
just have to go to work.”
Lightening the load along the way
was a Karl Malone from upstate
Louisiana. Only 400 or so folks in
Summerfield knew of him. Today,
the 6-9, 250-lb. forward is better rec-
ognized as the Mailman. Thejunior

delivers over 16 ppg and 8.5 rpg, I

which are both Bulldog highs.

His first year (1981-82) coincided
with Russo’s most troubled times.
First, Malone’s reported l.97 high
school QPA fell three points shy of
the 2.00 ground level, necessitatinga
redshirt. Then Russo threw two
players off the team for personal
reasons.

Tech finished ll-16.

As Malone’s proficiency in class
began to resemble his excellence on
the court, Tech aimed for stardom.

A 72-18 record in the interim trans- ‘

lated into an NIT appearance and
consecutive NCAA Tournament
invitations.

Stubbornly, Russo maintains that
it wasn’t just Malone that pitched
Tech to postseason play. His evi-
dence? Six tournaments, six differ-
ent Bulldogs named all-tourney.

look toward finals

By Mitch Vingle
The Pitt News

University of Pittsburgh women’s
gymnastic coach Donna Sanft will
need some help from a few “South-
erners" when the 1985 NCAA
Northeast Regionals roll around
March 30 at 7 p.m. in Fitzgerald
Field House. Kim and Jackie Calde-
rone and Cathy Colemand, all from
Pittsburgh’s South Hills area, will
try to put Pitt in the driver’s seat
when it hosts the event,

“We will have all the best teams
from New England, down the East-
ern Seaboard and over to Ohio,”
said Sanft. “We are getting the true
cream of the crop in here.”

The top six teams with the highest
seasonal averages qualify for team
competition. Ohio State, Penn
State, New Hampshire and Pitt are
currently in the top four slots.

The Lady Panthers are optimistic
about their chances. Pitt placed
second to Penn State in last season‘s
regionals. In a recent meet against
OSU, the No. 7 squad, the Lady
Panthers lost by less than two
points. So far, the Buckeyes are in
the driver’s seat for the top seed. If

Student athlete:

By Jim Brueckner
The Pitt News

Every time I hear it, it makes me
sick. “Superjock Smith will not be
eligible for next fall's season because
he has been declared academically
ineligible." Great logic.

That’s like your neighbor losing
his job because be cost the company
softball team a game by striking out
with the bases loaded.

You’ll never hear this one on the
news: “Superbrain Jones will be
barred from the classroom next
semester because of his 48-percent
free throw accuracy.”

Neither of these men should ever
face that problem. The two areas are
unrelated. But why is there a double
standard?

First of all, let me state that I agree
with the argument that a university
is a learning institution first and an
athletic factory second. But what we
have here is an interesting problem.

For an athlete to get to the pros,

“It ‘s just a matter of get-
ting that killer instinct in
all four events.”

— Coach Donna Sanft

this athletic trio can perform to their
capabilities, an upset is possible.

Freshman Kim Calderone must
have a good meet if Pitt is to win. An
all-around performer, the Baldwin
graduate has recorded season-high
scores of 35.9 in the all-around com-
petition, 8.75 on the vault, 9.3 on the
uneven parallel bars, 9.4 on the bal-
ance beam and 9.1 on the ﬂoor.

“Kim has been one fall away from
a 36 all season,” said Sanft. “She’s
been consistently in the nines on the
bars and in the floor exercise. When
she hits on the beam, she can score in
the mid-nines. It's just a matter of
getting that killer instinct in all four
events.”

Calderone was the 1983 WPIAL
and PIAA all-around champion for
Baldwin. She placed second in the
all-around and first in the beam at

he normally has to play for a college
team in order to be drafted. Hockey
is an exception, where many players
jump straight from high school into
the pros. Baseball has a few, too, but
that leaves other sports - specifi-
cally football and basketball - with
that interesting problem.

A law student must meet no
athletic standards to forward his
career, but an athlete must meet aca-
demic standards to further his.
Sorry, folks, but I can’t justify this
kind of prejudice.

This creates a second problem.
We all know that some athletes
never go to class but somehow end
up passing their classes at the end of
the year. To tell you the truth, I can’t
blame them. They remind me of
Dirty Harry. They use illegal, uneth-
ical methods to battle a system that
has far more unethical methods.

So let’s get back to the original
problem. There are many people in
the world who are very intelligent
and very ambitious, but who are not
physically gifted. They are referred
to as nerds, wimps or geeks. But they
are human beings, and when they get

The women of the '85 gymnastics team

the 1984 PIAAS.

Junior Jackie Calderone is per-
forming on the uneven bars, on the
balance beam and in the floor exer-
cise. Her season high scores are 8.90
on the vault and 8.8 on the uneven
bars and beam.

“Jackie has been a starter in three
events for us this year,” said Sanft.
“Her best scores have been coming
in the vault, but she has potential in
the bars and on the beam. Right
now, we're doing a lot of repetitions

with her to get ready for the

regionals.”

Cathy Coleman, a freshman, is a
graduate of Upper St. Clair High
School. Her season-high scores are
32.35 in the all-around, 8.8 on the
vault, 8.55 on the uneven bars, 8.2
on the beam and 8.6 on the floor.

“Cathy has been performing in

every meet," said Sanft. “She has

to college, they are treated as such.
They are given a fair shot. Nothing is
demanded of them that is of a physi-
cal nature, and nothing is given to
them that they don’t earn.

On the other hand, there are many
physically gifted athletes who simply
are not blessed with the intelligence
of others. Some are slow learners.
Some are barely capable of reading.
They simply “can’t cut it" in the
classroom. But when they get to col-
lege, they must pass college level
courses that are completely beyond
their capabilities, considering the
time that is committed toward the
team.

Who are we to decide which
should be more important to them?
Some are gifted mentally, others
physically. Both should be treated
equally. Because these athletes need

college to get to the pros but don‘t
necessarily have the academic tools,
why can’t we work out a solution? A
solution would avoid the scandals
surrounding the student-athlete and
avoid exposing an 18-year-old ath-
lete to corruption.

How about this solution? If an
athlete enters college strictly to play
a sport with the hope of getting
drafted and going on to a profes-
sional career, do not force him to
attend classes. But don't give him a
degree, either. We all know that that
happens all too often.

Let’s make it possible for athletes
to merely play for a team and not
have any academic responsibilities
to meet. An athlete can live in the
dorms, play for the team, and that's
It.

Some may complain that we
should not provide a “free ride for
dumb jocks." However, “dumb
jocks” are people, too. They deserve
the right to pursue the career that
they choose. Also, they more than
pay back this “free ride” with the
money that a school makes from

Imagine how much more money
Boston College made because of
Doug Flutie. Although not all ath-
letes have the drawing power of a
Doug Flutie, they all contribute to
the success of a team, and success
always sells (at least enough to cover
a scholarship). '

For those athletes who do wish to
attend classes, we should not sus-
pend them from the team because of
failure in the classroom. Remember,
it’s their life. If they don’t make it in
the pros and have nothing to fall
back on, it’s their problem. They
should make that decision. After all,
this is supposed to be (drum roll,
please) “America, land of
opportunity!"

A certain young fellow from_ the
early part of this century was quite a
good baseball player but not too
intelligent. If Babe Ruth had been
forced to go through college to get to
the pros, America may have never
known one of its greatest sports
heroes.

Tech hoping to upset
tournament regulars

“We have played and won several
games with him in foul trouble,"
Russo further countered. “No doubt
Karl is the best player, but overall
it‘s a solid, supporting cast.”

The 73-64 December upset of
Louisville vaulted Tech into the
polls. It hasn't slipped since. Last
Saturday the Bulldogs edged Lamar
70-69 for the Southland Conference
title and a fifth seed in the Midwest.

As soon as Russo admits, “there's
[no] doubt we wouldn't be ranked
without Malone,” he also credits
others. There’s Willie Simmons, a
6-11 Kareem look-alike with 55
blocks; sophomore Robert Godbolt,
a guard shooting 59.9 percent; and
assists (5.06) leader Wayne Smith.

Only Malone scores in double fig-
ures. This can be explained by Rus-
so’s defensive leanings. Prior to
coaching Panola Junior College in
Carthage, he somehow lived off a
$100 monthly stipend Texas-El Paso
offered for a graduate assistantship.

The salary was pitiful, but the les-
sons weren't. Don Haskins still
coaches the Miners, still employing
his defensive-minded ideology. “I
learned a lot from him," Russo said
of his 1975-76 stint.

\

 
 
 

Russo also “kind of explored”
other basketball mentors including
Arkansas’ Eddie Sutton and Fresno
State's Boyd Grant. Now he has his
own defense department.

“I subscribe to a basic style, pick-
ing updifferentthings from different
people,” Russo added. “One aspect
of the game we’ve made a commit-
ment to is man-to-man. We don't
full-court pressure much -— not full-
court, rather half-court. We zone a
little bit, but only about 20 or 30
percent of the time.”

It’s been a while since Russo
“couldn’t even get an interview,
things were so tight" for a high
schooljob in Chicago. The next best
thing was teaching ninth grade for
five years in Galveston.

Then the brother-in-law tele-
phoned about the opening at
Panola.

“At that point I wouldn’t have to
knock on any more doors," said
Russo, .lUCOjob in hand. “I was on
my own. No aides. Place hadn’t
done much with basketball. It got
kids from all over the place.

“All I had to do was
myself.”

It sounded so simple at the time.

lmagine Bill Fralic playing
football without his protective
gear. That’s what the British
sport of rugby is like. It is a rough
contact sport characterized by
continuous action that requires
excellent physical condition and
stamina.

Rugby originated in England

in 1823 as a spinoff ofsoccer, but‘

the sport has only recently
become widespread in the United
States among both men and
women. Like soccer and Ameri-
can football, the competing
teams score points by forwarding
the ball into the opponent’s end
zone or by kicking the ball
through the goal posts.

The Pittsburgh Women’s
Rugby Team was introduced as a
city team about seven years ago
and boasts a high ranking in the
U.S. as part of the Midwest
Rugby Union. The team is com-

Rough British sport picks up popularity

prised mainly of professional
women, but several Pitt students 3
have ioined the team.

Practices are held every Tues-
day and Thursday evening at
Trees Field (behind Trees Hall).
All matches are held on the
weekends (since many of the
women have professional com-
mitments during the week), and
home matches are played at the
Schenley Oval in Schenley Park.

According to Leslie Bertel,
match secretary for the team,
there are no rule differences
between men’s and women's
rugby. She noted, however, that
“women use more finesse where
men use more brute strength.

“There’s a rugby team in just
about every major city in the
United States," Bertel explained.
“Rugby is played all year round.
The only months we don‘t play
are December, January and half
of February.”

The Pittsburgh Women’s
Rugby Team will have its first
regular match of the season on
March 23 with Slippery Rock

“ Women use more

ﬁnesse where men use

more brute strength.”

match secretary

and IUP. Tomorrow, the team
will take on CMU in a scrim-
mage designed to break in some
of the newer members of the
team as well as to prepare the
veterans for the upcoming
matches.

“This is going to be more of a
teaching kind of a game. It’s
more of a practice warm-up for
both CMU and us,” Bertel said.
“We’re always recruiting new
members — no experience is
necessary for those who would
like to try out for the team.”

cerning the Pittsburgh Women's
Rugby Team, call Leslie Bertel at

Russo’s assessment of his team's
strengths and weaknesses,” Chip-
man said. “They play unlike other
teams in the Southland [Confer-
ence]. They’re not as much run-and-
gun, and I question whether they
play 80 percent man defense and the
rest zone. It’s pretty much the other
way around."

Chipman admitted that he’s seen
only one Tech game film.

When it comes time for the real
thing, Chipman naturally will want
a Panther squad different from the
one he saw faltering against FSU.

“After playing teams like St.
John’s, Syracuse and Georgetown,”
he said yesterday, “as we have, you
learn to respect everybody and be in
awe of nobody. That’s our situation
now.”

Off The Boards: Sophomore
point guard Curtis Aiken started
practicing again yesterday after
missing two days because of a death
in the family.

Pitt and Tech have never met. The
last time the Panthers faced a South-
land Conference team, Lamar
(whose 80-game home win streak
was snapped by the Bulldogs last
year) won 67-65 in 1980.

dressed and ready to go at the field
house. Calisthenics are led by senior
captains Paul Westwood from
Peabody High School and Tom
Horew from Churchill. The players
go through a variety of stretches to
get the blood flowing and muscles
awake, under the watchful eyes of
head coach Bobby Lewis and his
assistant Larry Wayman.

“ltjust goes to show you how ded-
icated these guys are,” said Lewis.
“For me, this is my job, but it is the
kids‘ commitment. The north isn’t
the best place to play ball, so it takes
a special kind of ballplayer to go
through this kind of practicing.”

“I, myself, am not a morning per-
son,” said Chris Jelic, a junior from
Mt. Lebanon and member of the
Panther football team. “Getting up
early is tough, but it is our only
available practice time. We have to
work around basketball, so that
means the morning.”

“At first, getting up is a pain, but
you get used to it,” said southpaw
Rich Gavran of the North Hills.
“Every day you get up, it is just one
day closer to the season.”

Westwood, who plays shortstop,
thinks differently when it comes to
morning practices. “I hate them,” he
said. “You never get used to getting
up that early. But it is the only time
we can practice.”

The team is scheduled to play 42
games this year. To prepare for this
long and arduous schedule, the team
trains all year long, with intrasquad
games in the fall and workouts in the
weight room during the winter
months.
