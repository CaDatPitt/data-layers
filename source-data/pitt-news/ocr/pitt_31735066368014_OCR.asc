Pitt Studentwith Debate Team

By RAY WUSLICH

A Pitt student is part of an Amer-

ican debate team whose tour of the
Soviet Union is being filmed by a
Public Broadcasting Station.

William Skundrich, a graduate
student in Slavic languages, is
among three debators who will face
Russian teams at several Soviet
universities.

Their experiences will be filmed
for the Frontline series produced by
WGBH Boston and anchored by
Jessica Savitch.

The team left for Russia Satur-
day and will return to the U.S. Oct.
24. It will visig Moscow, Lenin-
grad, Kiev, Baku, Volgograd and
Tallin.

The project is sponsored by the
Committee on International Dis-
cussion and Debate (CIDD), which
regularly sponsors debate tours
between Soviet and American
debators.

CIDD is headed by speech pro-
fessor Thomas Kane, who also
chairs Pitt's speech department.
Kane coached the team that tra-
veled to Russia in 1980.

Obtaining permission for a film
crew to accompany the team.wasn’t
a simple matter, and it was Kane’s
previous experience that helped
them gain admittance.

The history of Soviet policy
toward allowing American televi-
sion into their country has been
“one of reluctance and bureau-
cratic obstinance. They don't feel
that they get a fair share of the U.S.
media,” Kane said.

It took only one month for the
Soviets to decide to allow the film
crew, Kane said.

“The Soviet agencies have confi-
dence in CIDD,” Kane said. “Still,
we were apprehensive about
whether or not they would approve
the film crew. We certainly did not

Wus/ich photo

want to make the documentary a
prerequisite for the continuation
of the exchange program. We value
this program too highly,” Kane

been placed on what can and can-
not be filmed, there will be a Soviet

Youth
March

By PEGGY FERRI

Jewish youth of Pittsburgh
showed their solidarity with Soviet
Jewry in a candlelight ceremony
last night on the Cathedral lawn.
The protest, attended by 50 people,
coincided with the Jewish holiday
Simchat-Torah, which is the one
day when Jews in the Soviet Union
stand up and identify themselves as
such in defiance of Soviet
authorities.

Soviet Jewry has been oppressed
for the last 65 years, and the youth
have the responsibility to speak for
their brethren, according to Zach-
ary Grayson, director of the univer-
sity Masada, which sponsored the
protest. Grayson said that this
event will be held annually in the
future now that Masada is a
partially-recognized group on
campus. The event was also spon-
sored by many other Jewish
organizations.

The theme of the ceremony and
speeches was that people should no
longer remain silent while Jews are
being oppressed and denied their
human rightson a daily basis in
the Soviet Union.

Soviet Jews constitute the second
largest Jewish community, accord-
ing to ‘Rabbi Bernard Poupko.

“They are the only ethnic group
in Russia that _is denied even one!»

adviser to the film crew.

“There are some things that you
just don’t film in the Soviet
Union,” Kane explained. “It I is
more of a custom than a law.”

The idea for a documentary
arose as a way of increasing under-

lllt Gustine’s

By DIANE LEFKOWITZ

Gustine’s restaurant hosted a
different sort of clientele Thurs-
day night.

In addition to the regulars
who frequent the Forbes
Avenue lounge, a group of
debaters in the back room con- ‘
ducted a trial run of a‘ debate to
be held in the Soviet Union.

A documentary of the debate
will be part of the “Frontline”
series, anchored. by Jessica
Savitch. David Fanning is exec-
utive producer of the series and
Wayne Ewing is producer-
director.

The group will debate Soviet
students at universities in half a
dozen cities, including Moscow
and Leningrad, during a two-
week tour of the Soviet Union.

The trial debate at Gustine’s
served as an orientation for the
tour. The audience consisted
mostly of people who had lived
in Russia or studied the Rus-

sian language. The debaters

Debaters Go Through Trial Run

and spectators went over the
speeches and discussed the
kinds of arguments they’ll hear

. in the Soviet Union.

The tour is sponsored by the
Committee on International
Discussion and Debate (CIDD)
of the Speech and Communica-
tion Association. Thomas
Kane, chairman of the speech
department at Pitt, is also chair-
man of CIDD.

The American delegate is
composed of Michael Hazen,
a professor in the department of
communication at Wake Forest
University; William Skund-
rich, .a graduate student in
Slavic languages at Pitt; Mar-
garet Niles, a law student at
Stanford University; and John
Tokolish, a graduate of Mid-
dlebury College and legislative
aid to Senator Patrick
Moynihan. ‘

The topic of the debate,
which was delivered in Rus-
sian, was “War and Peace in the

System of Values of the Soviet
and American Societies.”

“The system of values of any
country are based on the rela-
tion between the individual and
the state,” Tokolish said in his
speech. He explained the ways
in which war and peace are
related to the system of values of
a nation.

“War demands the curtail-
ment of the rights of the indi-
vidual,” he said. “The
difference between a society
during wartime and during
peace is a good indication of the
system of values.

“The influence of the people
on the government in relation
to the conduct of war reflects the
system of values. The ability of
a people to deny its support for
its government’s policies is the
most important expression,
perhaps, of the superiority of
the individual over the state.

The Chinese World of America

By MICHAEL ROKNICK

He knew thatwhen he came
to the United States he would
be changing thecourse of his
life. He wasn’t sure of his direc-
tion; all he knew was that this
country would, in some way,
change his future.

Jack (an assumed name) is
one of the latest “new immi-
grants” to this country. First
came the Vietnamese boat peo-
ple, then the Cubans. Now,
Chinese immigrants are mak-
ing their way to our shores in
increasing numbers.

Jack is now attending school
in this country to learn better
English so that he can go on to
earn an engineering degree. He
came from the southern part of
China. There he graduated
from the Chinese equivalent of
high school. Since he did not do
well in his college entrance
ex/ams (required for college
atmzptance in China), he could
not go to college and instead
worked in a tractor factory.

Chinese high schools are not
like their- American counter-
parts. Under the direction of
Chairman Mao, and later under
the rule of the Gang of Four,
students had to work four terms
on a farm‘ and another four
terms in a factory.

’ “Under Chairman Mao’s
Cultural Revolution, .I feared
going to school,” says Jack.
“When we learned something
frem a book, we had to keep it
to ourselves. We were con-

\.

stantly aware of the police send-
ing students to jail for speaking
out against the government, so
if we had any resentment
towards the government, we
kept it in our minds and out of
our mouths.”

The . Chinese attitude
towards Mao is, indeed, an
interesting one. When Mao

started the Cultural Revolution
in 1966, schools were closed,
churches destroyed and a whole
population began reciting pas-
sages from the now famous
“Little Red Book.” And accord-
ing to “The Guiness Book of
World Records,” Mao ordered
the execution of over 25 million
people.

“And yet,” says Jack, “we
believed that he was a god. This
is because during the Cultural
Revolution all religion was
destroyed, and since there was
nothing else to believe in, Mao
took religion’s place. In Amer-
ica, you are fortunate; if you do
not believe in your president,
you can still believe in your
religious god.”

However, it was also during
the reign of Mao that relations
with the United States were
opened. This new relationship
helped China to obtain much-
needed technology from the
West. But the biggest achieve-
ment of the Mao era was the
gradual elimination of famine
among the populace. This
accomplishment is especially
admired by older Chinese.

“When Mao died, people
who were over 40 cried. I didn’t.
I think "it’s because I didn’t

know what life was like in the
old social times before 1949,
when Mao came to power. I can
remember seeing my father cry-
ing when he learned that Mao

had died. When I asked him,

why he was crying, he said thatt
Mao had niade it better tham
before. A
‘‘I think? that is the reason
why the old and young differ on
their opinions of Mao. We
young people just don’t have
the comprehension to know
what life was like before Mao.
“I, like most of my friends,
hate Mao. I hate what he stood
for, and I hate the destruction
he brpught to China. I’ve had
many arguments with my
father about Mao. It is strange
that even after his death Mao
brings trouble to our family.”
This attitude is common
among China’s young people,
causing a unique generation
gap in a communist land. Jack
sees this gap as the main reason
why many Chinese students are

now flocking "to America. The 

advent of China’s “open door?
policy” has made it easier than .

before forstudents to study in
Western nations. In some cases,
though not in _]ack’s, the
government will bear part or all
of the student’s educational
cost.

Since the Chinese govern-

is staying with relatives and
working part-time in their fam-

ily restaurant. He cannot get a 
full-time job elsewhere because *4;

he first has to get permission
from the U.S. government,

permission, he would like to
work on his,own in New York;

he doesn’t like being dependent 1,:

on his relatives.
“In China,
death, we read in our newspap-

’ ers that America was a bad ;1
place because it was a capitalist. :
society and as a result, it had i
high inflation. And that mur- 
derers and robbers were run- *
ning through the streets. We ‘I’

were also. told that if you lived
in America you might not have
enough food to eat. This
thought is still in the minds of
many of our people.

“Since 1976, when Mao died,
we read that the U.S. had a lot
of technology; this helped to
improve our image of America.
We also learned through Amer-
ican tourists what life was like
over here. I remember asking
myself, ‘Why is it that Ameri-
cans can come to China, but
Chinese can't go to America?’ I
realized it was because Ameri-
cans had more money.” _

When Jack lived in-China,
his family of four had to live in
a small three-room apartment,
with an outside lavatory that
had to serve an entire apart-
ment complex. It was not unus-
ual for a person to stand in line
for 45- minutes before they
could use the facility.

Since coming to the U.S.
three months ago, Jack is only
now getting accustomed to the
house he is living in. By Ameri-
can standards, it is an average

/ 

which is not easy. Should he get 

before Mao’s 

home, but to Jack, a house hav-
ing two bathrooms, three bed-
rooms and a family room is
unheard of.

When asked if he wants to
return to China after he’s com-
pleted his education, Jack had
to think for several minutes
before answering.

“If the government supports
you as a student, part of the
agreement is that you have to
return to China. But I know of
two people who married U.S.
citizens and remained in the
country. Most of the Chinese
students I’ve met, upon leaving
China, think they want to
return. But when they come to
America and live here for a
while, they want to stay. I don’t
know yet if I want to go back. If
I” decide to remain here, the
government may cause trouble
with my family, especially my
parents. I know that if I become
:an engineer, there will be work

, = 9;

a
‘.

‘waiting for me in China. The
factory that I worked in had

over 1,300 workers, but there.

were only four engineers. That
simply is just not enough. But
as to whether or not I’ll
return—I don’t know, I just
don’t know.”

Now that Jack is in America,
he has started to attend the Chi-
nese Presbyterian Church. This
new experience, at first, left
him wondering what religion
was trying to communicate to
him. Since he had never heard
of Jesus or the Bible, the expe-
rience of attending church was
a learning process. But now, he
has a different reason for going
to church.

"‘I don’t believe in anything.
I don’t believe in God. I don’t
believe in the chairman. I go to
church, but I don’t believe in it.
I just go there to study English.
I like to listen to the minister so
I can speak better English. A
church is a good place to study.

“I guess the reason I don't
believe in God is becausel grew
up being told that anyone who

Page 2-

The Pitt News, Monday October 11, 1982

believed in God was a fool. The
communist way of life provided
us with our rel-igion, with
Chairman Mao as our leader.”

China is now allowing
churches to be rebuilt and to
believe in God is considered
socially acceptable. Bibles are
starting to permeate the society
with many American mission-
aries. And according to these
ministers, who claim to have a
large following, numerous
Chinese seek to better their
understanding of the wordof
God.

Jack agrees that there are
many Chinese going to see the
missionaries, however, he feels
that they are going so that they
can get to know Americans, not
for religious purposes.

He also says that the Chinese
are starved for knowledge about
the outside world. The news-
papers apparently only carry

at

 
 
 
 
 
  

China if we dislike something"
that our government did, we
can't talk openly about it. But
here, nobody cares, not even the
police would care if I had any-
thing to say about your
government.

“Another big difference I see
in our two countries is that if a
group of people in the United
States really hated the govern-
ment, it could easily overthrow

Ir»

it because weapons are so easy g

to get here. Even your president
was shot with a gun recently,
and I think that, in a small way,
that’s why your government is
more responsive to its people.
But in China, we could never
hope to topple our government
because weapons just aren’t
available to the average person.
The only way I can see our
government being overthrown
is by our military, and that is a
very doubtful possibility.”
Jack sees China as a country
that is not free. As he sees it,

If there has been no real change in

China for over 25 years. Stu-
dents are the one group of peo-
ple that has the most animosity
towards the government. Jack
says that the students see them-
selves working hard but not

achieving any real freedom.

 And with Americans coming

    
  
   
 

 same

« against

into the country daily, these
students see that the

“The students are angry

the government

"  because they have no freedom

 
 

goes on politically between the
two countries. So as a result, the
people have no clear-cut idea of
what an average American is
like, though it is known that to
be in America is to be in the
proverbial land of milk and
honey.

“Most Americans think that
the Chinese government lies to
its people. I don’t think this is
true. It’s not that they’re lying.
It’s just that they are not telling
us anything. I wish the govern-
ment would let us know
everything——especially the way
they spend our money. In
American newspapers and TV,
they are saying a lot about how
your government spends its
money. They keep talking
about cuts in the social pro-
grams and raises in the mil-
itary. I'm not sure whether this
is good or bad, but at least the
American people know what is
being done with their money.

“I’ve noticed that that is the
one thing Americans take for
granted most often—the free-
dom to speak their minds. In

said that only

 socialism can save China. I
ffbelieve that freedom will save

ii’ won’t be because of a war. I
'  think that the change will come
 through a smoother way.”

Since Jack ‘has been going to

college, he has come across
many students and teachers
* whose company he enjoys. He

feels he has a good relationship
with his fellow students and
doesn’t believe that he is being
discriminated against because
of his immigrant status.

“The teachers are especially
nice. I am surprised athow well
they try to help me.”

He also feels that the Ameri-
can people are more respectful
than people in China. A

“In China, if I didn’t know
you, I would never speak to
you. But here, people I’ve never
seen before say hello to me on
the street. I like that. I think
Americans are nice people.”

When asked what he likes
most of all about America, he
replied, “Air conditioning. In
China there's no air condition-
ing, but here it’s like living the
entire year in spring. And the
central heating in the winter
time is new to me also. In my
home in China, we had only
our cooking stove to keep us
warm, and even then, we were
still cold. But here you could
leave your windows and doors
open and still be comfortable.”

nchuck Pascal, Young Politician

Profile:

By PAUL UNDERWOOO

While a majority of stu-
dents don’t even bother to
vote, it would be inaccurate
to characterize everyone
between 18 and 25 as politi-
cally apathetic. There are
always exceptions.

Pitt student Chuck Pascal
is one.

its The 18-year-old sopho-

:«. fir

more is a Democratic com-
mitteeman from » the
Oakland area. His district
includes almost all the Pitt
residence halls and part of
the Schenley Farms area.

Pascal, who was elected to
that position in May, said he
is probably the youngest
committeeman ever for that
district.

“I’ve always been inter-
ested in politics,” the politi-
cal science major said. He
was encouraged by friends at
Pitt to run for the position.

As a committeeman, Pas-
cal said he “deals with
informing the citizens of the
city of decisions that affect
them and helping them with
any problems they might
have with the city.”

Pascal said he hasn’t had
much contact with Pitt
students.

“I haven’t so far, but I
hope to have a chance to do
so in the future.”

 One issue Pascal worked

___ the PAT fare
increase. The original pro-

posal for fare increases

on was

The Pitt News, Monday October 11, 1982

announced by the Port
Authority in May proposed

that the price of U-Tickets

be raised from 25 tickets for
$15 (an equivalent of 60
cents or 80 percent of the
fare) to 20 tickets for $17 (an
equivalent of 85 cents or 85
percentiof the fare).

Pascal said he thought it
was important to protest the
fare hike because the percen-
tage of increase in student
fares was larger than that of
other groups.

He testified against the
increase at" a public hearing
on June 18, saying the U-
Ticket price hike amounted
to a 42 percent increase

while the general public was ~

only getting a 33 percent
increase.

Pascal said at the hearing

that students are already

hard-hit by financial aid cut-
backs, and an increase in the
fares could be “the straw that
breaks the camel’s back” and
forces some students to drop
out of school.

PAT, although eventually
implementing an increase,
reduced the student fare
increase from 80 percent to
75 percent. U-tickets now
cost the equivalent of 75
cents each. A book of 20 sells
for $15.

Pascal believes his testi-
mony helped and said his
age hasn’t caused problems

. or hurt his effectiveness.

“I think they take me
seriously,” Pascal said.

He is now busy trying to
bring in the vote for the
November elections. ‘‘It’s
"very difficult to get people to
register to vote,” he said. “If

   

Chuck Pascal
someone has the answer to
that problem, I’d like to hear
about it."

He added that he hopes to
run for political office some-
time in the future.

Senator Joseph McCarthy is best
remembered as the force behind the

’ l950’s “witch hunt,” but McCarthy

was not the man who inflicted the
most damage, according to Robert
Newman, a professor in Pitt’s
speech department.

Newman spoke at the. lecture
sponsored by the University
Honors Program Student Cabinet
entitled, “Who Started the Witch
Huntt?” last Wednesday and
accused the late Senator Pat
McCarran of Nevada of being the

most important congressman in
the investigations.

The term ‘.‘witch hunt” refers to
the congressional investigations in
the late ’40s and ’50s in which
many United States citizens were
labeled Communists and ordered
to appear before a special congres-
sional investigative committee to
defend themselves. V

According to Newman,
McCarthy did not leave an imprint
on pol-itics because of his censor-

.ship in 1952 and 1953. McCarran,

on the other hand, was able to con-
vince the academic and political
world that, because the accused

people were Communists, they
were disloyal to the United States.
“McCarran’s investigative find-

ings were accepted as far up as the ,

president,” Newman said.
“McCarran and his committees
were able to convince President
Truman that they had done a thor-
ough job of investigation.”

Newman said the McCarran
investigations were anything but
thorough.

“These investigations were cases
of prosecutions against individuals
who had no chance to really defend
themselves.” Newman said. “They
had lawyers, but their lawyers were

on Capitol Hill.

not allowed to speak.”

Newman told of papers that had
been found in a barn in Massachu-
setts belonging to the director of
the Institute of Pacific Research,
which were used as evidence
against accused Communists.
McCarran and his investigators
used these papers to intimidate and
make-fools out of the accused,
Newman said.

The investigators who worked
for McCarran, Newman said, were
sensation seekers who were only
after “flashy results and
excitement.

“An investiation showed that

these people were competing for
the front page, not for justice,”
Newman said. -

Two of McCarran’s investigators
spread the rumor that an accused
Communist, Owen Lattimore, was
a Russian .orphan adopted by
American parents.

“During the investigation, this
charge made Lattimore look bad,

and it didn't follow investigative

procedures,” Newman said.

After the hearings, the rumors
about Lattimore’s birth proved to
be false, but the damage to his rep-
utation had been done.

have always reigned supreme in
America, ” he added.

Skundrich described the role
of the rights of the individual
thoughout history in both
nations.

“In America, the passage of
time brought streams of Euro-
pean immigrants who desired
to build a society based on
democratic principles and per-
sonal liberty,” he said. “These
aspirations were codified in the
Bill of Rights.

“By contrast, in Russia the
passage of time brought yet
another autocratic dictator in
the guise of the czar. The Rus-
sians had thrown off the Tartar
yoke, only to be then subju-
gated by still another form of
despotism and rule by force and
coercion.”

Skundrich pointed out that
the U.S. did attempt to reduce
its military spending and the
size of its armed forces in 1968.

“In that year, the U.S. spent
9.5 percent of its GNP on
defense, by 1979 the defense
share of the U.S. GNP had been

cut almost in half, to 5 percent,"
he said.

“The Soviet response was to
steadily increase its armed for-
ces until they are now more
than double the size of the
American forces. The U.S.S.R.
also expanded military spend-
ing over the same period by
about one third.”

He believes that a freeze on
nuclear weapons would only
put the United States at a disad-
vantage and would be harmful
to an eventual plan of
reduction.

“The Soviet nuclear arsenal
has been growing at a rate of at
least 8 percent a year for more
than 20 years. As a result, any
sudden ‘freeze’ would penalize
the West for showing considera-
ble restraint during the same
period the Soviets were having
the largest military build up in
would history.

“Such a freeze would reward
the Soviets for initiating a new
arms race and would remove all
incentive for them to seriously
negotiate a reduction in nuclear
arms to lower and equal
numbers on both sides,” he
said.

The American delegation touring Russia: (left to right) Dr. Patricia Krafcik of Pitt’s
Slavic language department; Professor Michael Mazen, the team’s coach, from Wake
Forest University; John Tokolish, a legislative aide to Sen. Patrick Moynlhan; William
Skundrich, a graduate student in Pitt's Slavic language department; and Margaret Niles,
a law student at Stanford University.

Tokolish believes that Amer-
ica’s power lies elsewhere.

“The strength of our country
lies in an open society where
everyone can read, speak, ask
questions ‘and judge their own
government,” he said. “In other
words, where an individual can
express himself.”

Expresion of beliefs and the
opportunity to hear the beliefs

of others is the purpose of the
debate tour, according to Kane.

Kane has worked with the
program for six years and, with
Patricia Krafcik of Pitt's Slavic
program, has put .the whole
thing together. He traveled
with the team to the Soviet
Union in 1980 and was host for
the Soviet debaters who came to
the U.S. last April.

“Both groups end up liking
each other,” Kane said, “even
when they disagree. I don’t
think anybody’s minds were
changed, but with two coun-
tries that are hostile to v.aCh
other, this is very important.

“International understand-
ing may be the key to solving
the (situation) we have now."

standing in the U.S. about the
Soviet Union, Kane said.

“There is a great deal of misin-
formation on both sides,” he said.
“Debate offers a chance to remedy
this a little.

“One of the keys to alleviating
tension is cultural exchange. If a
televised documentary would reach
more Americans, perhaps that
would be a modest but important
step to increased understanding
about the Soviet Union in this
country.”

The debates, both here and in the
Soviet Union, are not restricted as
to what can be discussed. Although
there is a debate topic, people in the
audience are permitted to ask ques-
tions of the debators.

The topic of this debate tour is
“War and Peace in the System of
Values of the Soviet and American
Societies,”

“The debates will give the Soviet
people a chance to see that the
Americans aren’t just there to
advance the policy of their govern-

The Pitt News, Monday October 11,1932 if

ment," Kane said. “In 1980, the
Olympic boycott was offensive to
the Russians, and it needed to be
explained. The team that we sent
didn't agree with the boycott, and it
showed the people there that Amer-
icans can disagree with their
government.”

One of the American debators in
1980 was a born-again Christian,
who presented his views, and
“although there was argument,
discussion was allowed,” Kane
said.

The Russian tours have been
generally quiet, but the same can’t
be said for the debates here. The
problem of protestors does not
exist in the Soviet Union. But Kane
said that a debate at the University
of Maryland in 1976 had to be can-
celled because of protestors. He
also said that this year Amnesty
International passed out literature
during a debate at the University of
Florida.

The entire debate will be carried
on in Russian and the debators
must not only be fluent in that lan-
guage, but must also be able to

think and respond quickly to the
questions and issues at hand. The
same is true of the Soviet students
who travel to the U.S., where argu-
ments are made in English.

In addition to Skundrich, the
American team consists of Mar-
garet Niles, a law student at Stan-
ford University and John
Tokolish, a graduate of Middlebur-
ry College and legislative aide to
Senator Patrick Moynihan.

They can expect tough questions
from their Soviet audiences on
such topics as the American policy
towards the Soviet gas pipeline and
President Reagan's refusal to

renounce the first use of nuclear

weapons, Kane said.

Kane also sees the documentary
as a good piece of PR for Pitt. The
debators took part in a three-day
orientation session at Pitt, part of
which was filmed for the documen-
tary. Wayne Ewing, a representa-
tive from WGBH “was extremely
enthusiastic about using the Rus-
sian Nationality Room for back-
ground filming,” Kane. said.‘

single educational facility," he
said. He called the situation there a
“dreadful and consistent cultural
black out of 65 years.”

Moscow has engaged in “vicious
anti-Semitic attacks,” Poupko
said. He pointed out that the car-
toons in the two issues of Pravda
portrayed Jews as caricatures sim-
ilar to the ones commonly seen
before and during the Second
World War.

The way to remedy the situation
of Soviet oppression of Jews is to
focus public attention on the prob-
lem, according to Grayson.
Poupko agreed with this strategy

and added that Jews in the Soviet
Union want to be united with their
people and live as Jews, which he
said is an elementary right that is
being denied them.

“One way to focus public atten-
tion is to keep the issue alive in the
press," Poupko said later. “The
issue has died down somewhat, but
there must be freedom for the Rus-
sian Jews.”

The Soviet Union is very sensi-
tive to its image in the eyes of the
free world, according to Poupko.
He said that the attention of not
only this country, but of the world,
should focus on the Soviet Jewry
and the wrongs perpetuated.

Opinion

Em.

Sorry, Rachel

Twenty years ago, one of the most influential
books of our time was published. It led to a slew of
state and local laws regulating the use of pesticides,
fueled the fires of the ecology movement and helped
to create the Environmental Protection Agency.
That book was Rachel S. Carson’si“Silent Spring.”

Remember DDT? That’s what living creatures,
including humans, would still be eating if it weren’t
for her. ,

This woman wasn't naive. She expected herself
and her book of four and a half year’s research to be

attacked. She wasn’t disappointed.

She was strongly attacked by the chemical indus-
try, and more surprisingly, by book reviewers from
publications like The New York Times, and.Time
magazine for being partisan and trying to scare the
American public. '

Despite the staggering popularity of “-Silent
Spring” and the movement it sparked, total volume
of pesticides used in the United States has actually
increased. I

Isn’t that comforting? ,

CBS News commentator Bill Moyers reported in a
special report that one of the chemicals sprayed on
oranges has unknown effects. One thing is for
certain—the chemical killed the experimental mice.
At the very least this situation merits some investiga-
tion, but from where will the new Rachel Carson
emerge?

Don’t be lulled into a false sense of security by
believing that since there is an Environmental Pro-
tection Agency the environment is protected. That
word “protection” looks nice on paper, but consid-
ering that the Reagan Administration borders on
dismantling the entire agency, it follows that it can’t
protect very much of anything—at least not now.

Taking court actions against every industry that
violates environmental laws (what’s left of them)
costs money. Spokesmen for the EPA have said that

. now is the time for priorities because the resources -to
pursue every violation just don’t exist.

Last year, scientists met in Stokholm and agreed
that acid rain is causing major environmental dam-
age in America and Canada. A Reagan Administra-
tion environmental officer, however, said that efforts
to control acid rain without more research would be
wasteful and possibly environmentally damaging.
The problem has been documented by this and other
countries since 1955.

As long as fighting corporations is an uphill bat-
tle and the hands of the EPA are financially tied, our
safety as healthy members of the human race will be
in jeopardy.

Sorry, Rachel.

Merrily We Roll Along

Dear Editor:

There’s something amiss in the
electoral process. The theory is that
would-be candidates comply with
the rules set by the legislature and
become bona-fide candidates. (In
my case, as a candidate for the U.S.
Senate, the rules required that I
gatter 30,000 signatures on peti-
tions, which I did). Once candi-
dates have met the legal
requirements, the electorate is sup-
posed to have the chance to hear
what the candidates have to say,
what they stand for, how they envi-
sion policies for the nation and the
state. Voters, having heard them,
decide on the fitness of the candi-
dates to hold office and on the
appropriateness of their views on
issues, and make their choices in
the polling booth.

Thus, democracy runs merrily,
merrily on and we all live happily
ever after. Right?

Wrong. Candidates do comply
with the rules set by the State
Assembly. But then, various extra-
legislative groups decide that only
certain candidates are “real” or
“serious.” These groups are the
press, with its constitutional privi-
lege founded on the right and
necessity of the people to know,
and the League of Women Voters

founded to give women access to
the electoral system.

The press, having decided in
advance who can win, tells the
public only about those candidates
it has chosen. Thus it calls the elec-
tion in advance and ensures its
prophecy at the same ‘time that it
usurps the Assembly’s authority to
decide what qualifies a candidate.

Radio and TV, being regulated by
the FCC, must comply with certain
rules of fairness, but not the news-
papers, which can do as they
please. Thus, when radio station
WGSQ in Ephrata, sponsored a
debate among Senator Heinz,
Commissioner Wecht and Liane
Norman (Sept. 29), Pittsburgh
papers told their readers that only
Heinz and Wecht had debated.
There was an odd format to be sure:
Heinz and Wecht in the first hour,
Norman in the second. But the
questions were the same, though
the answers between the first two——
virtually Tweedledum and
Tweedledee—-differed considera-
bly from the third. The local news-.
papers, the Press and Post-Gazette
simply pretended that a third f that
event did not exist.

a The League of Women voters, in
sponsoring a debate between Heinz
and Wecht, has told me that I can’t
possibly win (including the Social-
ist Workers and the Libertarian

Genuine Willingness

By ANN MARIE FREGGENS

In a society which prides itself on
its sense of fair play, “Christian” in
the sense that the Confucian.
judeo-Christain, Muslin golden
rule is a given, it is difficult to
fathom how the massacres in Bei-
rut are allowed to continue. It
should not matter that the Middle
Wast is alien to out cultural way of
life; indeed, Americans are the
newcomers in avery old world. No
native-born American can claim
total kinship with his family's
former soil. His ethnic group is-
therefore tainted by each group’s
unique impurities.

America is on the fringes of eth-
nocentricity, even though our lack
of pure bloodlines forbids ethno-
centric beliefs. This lack of actual
ethnocentricity allows for a for-
midable strength I’ to be derived
from our youthfulness as a nation.
We are noted for out genuine wil-
lingness to help others when they
are in need, eg. the prototypical
"l)arnraising" aspects of helping
Ilood_victims in South America,‘

johnstown and elsewhere. It is
therefore possible that this sense of
help as an obligatory situational
aspect of any natural disaster is
merely the vulgar man's sense of
morbidity, curiosity, or both.
America always helped: until now.

It is particularly unfortunate
that our usual “Christian” sense of
ethics has not asserted itself. The
child has gone onto other pursuits;
his interest in those “foreigners”
has been supplanted by the mun-
dane realities and dreains_ of the

..our ‘usual sense of
Christian ethics has not
asserted itself.’

American way of life. Strikesffood
prices and sexuality all play their
part in our raison d’etre which is
used as an excuse by the common
man—and even the uncommon
rnan—in not reaching out a kindly
hand. _
,(lh_ameile()n-lil<e, we absorb all

candidates in this assessment) and
therefore I am not worthy of being
heard. From the voters’ point of
view, the League has decided ahead
of time whom they may hear and
decided to keep them in ignorance
of other possibilities. When Icom-
merited that I was reminded of
countries in which the Central
Committee decides on candidates
and requires voters to affirm their
choice, one of the League’s promi-
nent local members remonstrated:
surely not, the comparison was
unfair!

Both the League and the press
have decided who will win, and
that decision is supposed to be up

An Interesting Contrast

‘Dear Editor:

It was good to see Drs. Glew and
Thayer back in the pages of The

*"Pz’tt News (“Med School Problems

Show No Signs of Abating”,
9/17/82; “A Little Advice for a Pitt
Whistle-Blower”, 9/22/82). Dr.
Thayer’s» advice to Dr. Glew
deserves some comment. First, Dr.
Thayer says that promotion is not
normal treatment of dissidents.
This is meant to imply that, since
Dr. Glew was promoted because of
his fine teaching and research
record, things are not really that
corrupt in the medical school, and
dissidents are not silenced by force
and threats. But the facts tell a dif-
ferent story. Dr. Glew received a
letter from his dean (Leon) threat-

wg, ening him with dismissal and/or

prosecution for shooting off his
mouth. This letter is dated a year
before his promotion. To the credit
of Dr. Glew the threats didn’t work.
To the discredit of Dr. Thayer’s
argument, personally-directed vin-
dictiveness was the immediate
response of the administration.
There is an aphorism much older
than Dr. Thayer’s theory of organi-
zations: the squeaky wheel gets the
grease. The cheap grease of threats
didn’t stop Glew’s squeaking.
After all, intimidation is the sincer-
est form of flattery from our admin-
istration. I am glad to see that the
more expensive grease of deserved
promotion hasn’t stopped Glew
‘either. Rather than suggesting that
things could be worse, for instance
'that‘academic promotion could be
used as a political tool bv the

administration, Dr. Thayer should
open his eyes to how bad the docu-
mentary evidence shows things
already are.

This leads to whatl take to be the
main point of Dr. Thayer’s advice.
That advice highlights an interest-
ing contrast between the two pro-
fessors’ approaches to the medical
school problem. Dr. Glew prefers
confrontation and the clear assign-
ment of responsibility for the aca-
demic decline and financial
shambles of the medical school. Dr.
Thayer, on the other hand. believes

‘They are isolated and
surrounded by syco-
phants, except in occa-
sional public ap-
pearances where , they
must face the hoi polloi
they are supposed to
serve.’

that a smoothly palatable (to those
in power), even complimentary,
gradualistic approach toward
improvement works better in an
“organization” such as Pitt. The
decision-makers here are so power-
ful, Dr. Thayer thinks, that to con-
front them merely raises their
hackles and stiffens their resist-
ance, rather than causing them to
pause and consider their actions.
Dr. Glew knows this well. He has
that letter containing a personal
threat to remind him. Yet he has
chosen the path of critical ques-

Now The Dream Is Over

Dear Editor:

Is there no justice in the world?
Must we be thrown into such a
cruel world like this? No warning.
We were so coddled, then our inno-

ence was ripped from us. We were

‘ “left naked, torn from our mother’s

breast, to face the world. I just
found out the news; I had heard
rumors of it. But who could believe

it? So, I shall mark this day down as
the day I stopped believing in
Camelot.

That is what today did to me,
today, the day I read that the Luna
had been remodeled. Ilve only felt
this way once before. It was I979. I
went back home for a weekend, and
found that the bar I’d first gotten
served in (at fifteen—I’ll never
forget the name, the Wormy Chest-
nut, I still have a T-shirt bearing its
logo) had closed and the name had
been changed to My Brother’s Inn,
under new management. No char-
acter, just a wimpy bar. This new
place had a jukebox. My God, the

' Wormy had eight Bose 90l’s filled

with 150 watts of power. We could
bring in records and they would

play them. I got the drunkest I've
ever been in the Wormy. The
drinking records we set in that bar
still stand.

That’s how I feel about the
Luna. I’ll never go back in. It will
never be the same. A monument to
the innocence of beer drinking has
passed on. I can remember dancing
in the Luna and having the bar-
tender tell me to be still because ifI
continued, the ceiling might fall
in. I remember seeing bats and
lizards crawling and flying every-
where, and reaching a peak to
White Rabbit (kill me now).

It may have all been imaginary,
but it only happened in the Luna.
Yes, I’ve stopped believing in
Camelot, princes and princesses.
The new students at Pitt will find
their dives. They may have similar
experiences, but none of it will ever
be the Wormy or the Luna! A true
era has passed! I guess it’s the real
thing now, no more dreams.

Un-

tioning, the path of-. Dean Shul-
man's recently touted “sinister
purpose” of the University (Pitt
News, 8/29/82). Why?

The fact of the matter is that
around here Dr. Thayer’s methods
don’t work. His acceptance of the
power of the practicing physicians
in the medical school and the
power of the subsidizing adminis-
tration merely serves to reinforce
that power and to make the power-
ful ever more heedless of disagree-
ment of any urgency or value,
however sugar-coated. They are
isolated and surrounded by syco-
phants, except in occasional public
appearances where they must face
the hoi polloi they are supposed to
serve. _

We in the Department of Geo-
graphy stand as irrefutable positive
proof that patience and coopera-
tion with the administration lead
to disaster. The trust we placed in
agreements with the administra-
tion was used by them only to dam-
age seriously our academic lives.
We have been used.

Surely Dr. Thayer realizes that if
there are no individuals among the
masses who are willing to chal-
lenge the powerful, then there is
nothing to prevent error or even
blatant, corrupt favoritism. The
victims of discriminatory treat-
ment cannot be expected to trust
their leaders’ personal talents and
consciences with as much respect
as do the beneficiaries
arbitrariness.

Truly to lead well, leaders must
have the advice and consent of the
led. If leaders do not request those
things ‘sincerely and accept them
gracefully, then they deserve to
have them forcibly imposed. By the
same token, however, if the led
knowingly and willingly act as
sheep, they deserve to be sheared.

Playing
Games

Dear Editor:

After much hard and searching
thought, I’ve come up with a safe
way to endathe arms race, cut the
defense budget and still maintain
our security. It's really a simple
idea. It is modeled on an ancient
institution. An idea that’s been
used for years. A Military Olym-
pics! Every four years, ‘all the
nations would gather on some
remote island and play war. I can
envision it now; the hand grenade
throw, the tank assault, strafing
runs for accuracy (divided by plane
class, of course) and missile
accuracy.

Then there would be the team
events like village attack (or how
long does it take one battalion of
men to destroy and conquer a vil-
age?) We could “weigh" tonnage of
nuclear warheads. There could be
helicopter events. And let us not
forget the sea: beachfront assaults.

The list could go on. It would be .

held in a non-regular Olympic
year. Individual winners and team
winners would be crowned. Then
each nation could count up its
medals, and we’d all find out who
had the best military.

So the emphasis would go from
quantity to quality. Morale in mi]-
itary establishments would rise as
medals piled up. And if you lost,
well, there would always be the
next Games.

This idea doesn’t seem much
more ridiculous then what's cur-
rently being done.

Let the games begin!

Dear Editor:

Upon locking my room
located in Tower B, I rush down
the hallway to the stairway exit
door. An awful stench attacks
my nostrils as I open the door.
What could be producing this
vulgar scent? To my right I spot
a fungus-covered orange and to
my left an Edge shaving creme
can covered with the last ounces
of its contents. As I descend the
first set of steps, a foreign object
hanging from the ceiling
impedes my progress. I quickly
lower my head and scurry down
a few more steps. As I reach the
next platform, a strange phe-
nomenon overcomes me. My
feet refuse to move. Have I
become paralyzed or is the grav-

ity on this floor different?
I look around and observe a

plastic foam cup with a blue
and red insignia lying on its
side. Being in college, I deduce
that the once-liquefied content
of this cup is causing the pecul-
iar stationary state I am in.
Applying more force to my task,
I escape from the grasp of the
floor and continue onward. I
kick an empty Stroh’s can as -I
descend the next set of steps. My
motion halts once again as I
look up and see fermented ice

of

Making A Difference

By PEGGYFERRI

Thankfully, there are still a few
people who believe that one person
can make a difference and that it is
the duty of everyone of us to take
personal responsibility for the
preservation of life on this planet
and the continuation of the species.

Dr. Helen Caldicott is such a
person.

I’m not astonished that few peo-
ple will recognize her name, even
though Caldicott was recently
awarded the Humanist of the Year
award for her work in Physicians
for Social Responsibility. She is
considered a leading critic of the
nuclear hazards we face and one of
the few effective voices challenging
us to take action.

In her acceptance speech, as
reported in The Humanist maga-
zine, Caldicott spoke about some
effects of a nuclear war from a med-
ical standpoint. It might be
redundant to graphically describe

the injuries that would be suffered. ‘

Just in case you are curious, the
Pentagon has published a book
called “The Effects of Nuclear
War” in which it has worked out in
detail how far a piece ofrglass tra-
veling at hundreds of miles an hour
would penetrate the flesh.
Concerning the aftermath of a

nuclear war, Caldicott explained
that there is only a 30-day supply of
food in the world at one time. The
Third World nations depend on
that, but there will be no ships to
transport the food, there will be no
fuel and finally no people. She
added that massive starvation in
untargeted nations will follow,
combined with epidemics of dis-
ease and blindness and sunburn.

We really don't know what will
happen, entirely. Caldicott men-
tions that the only way to find out
is to do it—she and many others
hope we never will find out.

So far, we’ve been lucky. Consid-
ering, however, that Pentagon
computers have made somewhere
in the -neighborhood of 151 errors
in a 15-month period, our luck
might not hold. We were only 14
minutes away from annihilation in
November 1979, according to Cal-
dicott. It's very simple—there are
too many ways to make mistakes
and anyone who has seen the movie
“Fail-Safe” knows this all too well.

Caldicott says that she is aware
that she bears some responsibility
for what happens in this world.
and she is guided by that aware-
ness. She has shown that although
one person alone can't change the
situation, one person can make a
start.

«Bucknell Kicks Boaters
‘Despite TopEffort,2-0     ~

By JIMCOLLINS

Although the Pitt soccer team
had its best showing of the year
against Bucknell on Saturday, it
wasn’t enough for a win as the
Bisons got by the Panthers 2-0. Pitt

“controlled the action in the offen-

9*

'sive end, but they were unable to
put the ball into the net.

Buckne1l’s first goal came off a
direct kick to the goal from 30 yards
out. The Pitt defense attempted to
trap the Bisons offsides, but the
referees didn’t see the play the same
way the Pitt bench did. Despite
protest from the Panthers, the score
stayed 1-0.

Despite having numerous
opportunities, Pitt was unable to
score. In fact, the offensive pressure
led to the second Bucknell goal.

Pitt had the ball deep in Buck,-
nell’s defensive zone. Bemis puled
up the defenders to apply even
more pressure. The plan backfired
as the ball was kicked loose to a
Bucknell player who was clear for a
breakaway. Despite goalie Dave

that it would be a test for the team.

tougher than Vasvary probably
expected. The Panthers finished in

Brian Casey is out with a bruised

but he should return for the
Youngstown game.

V Another questionable starter is
Mike Russell. Russell sat out the

Bucknell game due to tendonitis.
Tom Trempus replaced Russell at
the sweeper position against Buck-
nell and, according to Bemis,
“played his best game all season.”

Like Bucknell, Youngstown
State has a number of returning
lettermen. Youngstown lost to Pitt
last ‘year 4-1, but they have
improved since then. Bemis said he
is looking for the sameintensity
that was present in the Bucknell

have their first win in four games.

Spikers Split Meet

ut Lose

By MARK A. SINDLER

The Lady Panther volleyball
team has been winning with the
regularity of each day’s dawning.

Despite a loss to Louisville, the
Panthers came out of their own
invitational classic this weekend
with a winning attitude. The
exception this time was that the
team played most of its matches
with only six or seven players.

In Friday’s encounter against
Louisville, Pitt dropped three

‘games 14-16, 4-15, 14-16. Against

Syracuse, the Panthers won deci-
sively l5-8, 15-7, 15-4.’

Then came the big matchup
with Penn State, in which Pitt sur-
vived 10-15, 16-14, 15-13,9-'15, 15-9.

In retrospect, there was no defi-
nite tournament champion, as Pitt,
Louisville and Penn State finished
with 2-1 records. Despite that, the
Nittany Lions, with the best over-
all game record, were declared the
champions. '

Against the Cardinals, coach
Shelton Collier thought he was see-
ing double.

“Us playing Louisville was like
looking in a mirror,” he said.
“They were playing over the week-
end similar to how we were playing
a couple of weeks ago. They came
in here and had to make a name for
themselves.

“In 16-14 games, we usually win
those kinds of contests. Louisville,
this time, though, gave the extra
effort to win.”

Collier said his squad did not
play to its maximum level. He des-
cribed the play of the game as one-
half desire and one-half technique.

Numbers

“We had no desire out there,” he
said. “We were nof hustling and
Louisville was. They were keeping
the ball off the floor. The next dayl
gave the girls a speech,” he said. “I
told them the loss would probably
knock us out of the rankings (17th)
and that there would be no more
pressure to deal with.”

Senior Robin Kukalis found
Col1ier’s belief well-founded.

“During the Louisville game,
our lineup was different. We were
loose, but not aggressive enough.
We went in there thinking the
game would go our way. .

“Then, against Penn State,” sh
said. “Our lineup changed and it
was a whole new experience. We
played hard and put forth a good
effort.”

Outside hitter Diane Zack also
spoke of the team’s attitude.

“My personal opinion about
Louisville is that we were fired up,
but we took them for granted,” she
said. “We pressed too much, and,
after a while, we got frustrated and
confused.

“When we played Penn State,
though, we were going to have fun,
a good time and play a crazy
defense. Shelton had gone over a
new game plan in the locker room
two hours earlier and everything
was new.”

Injuries to Judy Young (ankle)
and Kukalis (k'nee) forced Collier
to implement a new team defense’
and offense with the complement
of players available to him. There
was only one hour of preparation
for the change that created a defen-
sive setup to utilize Sally Gillespie.

a tie for thirdagainst three other
opponents.

Cleveland State, with 34 points,
was first. Malone College followed
with 36 and Pitt, along with

Akron, totaled 79 points, which

was good for a third place tie.
Individually, the Panthers were

'led by junior Todd Colas who

placed sixth and completed the 10-
kilometer course in 31:05. Bill

Moorhead was 13th with a time of
32:00. Sophomore Tony Campes-
ano finished 19th in 32:50. John
Hutchison and Terry Gallagher
placed 20th and 21st with times of
32:53 and 32:54, respectively.
Finally, junior Tom Bailey took
30th with a time of 33:22.
Vasvary, following the race, said,
“We have to work on closing the
1:50 gap between the number one

and number five men, but almost
everyone ran their best time for 10
kilometers.”

Senior.John Hutchinson said,
“Personally, I could have run
thirty seconds faster, but unfortu-
nately I just had one of those days.
As a team we didn’t run near our
present potential, and the perfor-
mance on the whole doesn’t reflect
how hard we've been working.”

Concerning the Big East meet,
Hutchinson said, “We have two

weeks to prepare and plenty to
prove.”

With that in mind, Pitt will need
to be in top shape for the Oct. 23rd
Big East meet. ‘The Akron Invita-
tional didn't bring out their best
performance, but there is still the ‘
possibility that the Big East meet
will.

No Settlement Near In NFL Player Strike

By DALE MOORE

The National Football League
Players Association strike is over
two weeks old with no end in sight.
N o talks have been scheduled. Both
sides are claiming the other is drag-
ging its feet; prospects look grim
for the resumption of professional
football.

There was one major develop-
ment last week related to the strike,
but it didn't take place at the bar-
gaining table. Rather, it came

about in the boardroom. Ted
Turner, who had made arrange-
ments to broadcast a series of 18
All-Star games featuring striking
players, cancelled the contests
pending a ruling from the courts
on the legality.

It was a bad week for Turner,
who had planned to telecast the
National League Championship
baseball series between the St.
Louis Cardinals and the Atlanta
Braves. Again, Turner was shot
down in court and had to settle for

only watching the games.

Although the loss of these games
may not seem terribly important, it
just may result in the ending of the
strike much sooner. You see, the
players who participate in these
games would have been paid and
the Players Association would have
also gotten a cut of the action to fill
the dwindling strikegfund.

As players find their Checkbooks
geting increasingly thinner, they
will be more willing to negotiate
and go back to playing ball. And

this may be sooner than you think.

The superstar players, who were
getting vast sums of money, com-
prise only a small percentage of the
association. Many of these people,
such as Lynn Swann, didn't want
the strike in the first place. The
strike was brought on by a few
players who are only seen on kick-
offs and_punts—the specialty team
players.

These players, who may play in
the league anywhere from 10 weeks
to 10 years, have banded together in

By DIANE VELOZO

Despite having one of the
most successful programs at the
collegiate level, women’s
athletics at Pitt has not received

f‘g£na[iOl1al publicity, nor the

much-needed cash necessary to
keep a program at such a lofty
level.

Pitt has a highly sophisti-
cated, success-oriented sports
program. This is not only true
for men’s athletics, but also for
women’s. Pitt’s women athletes
are highly trained and self-
sacrificing. They are partici-
pants in their individual sports,
but more importantly, they are
competitors. The bottom line,
as it is for the male athletes, is
national success, not necessar-
ily national attention.

So, where do the problems
- originate? Mainly from lack of
funding and student support.
Like everyone else in the sports
program, women’s athletic
coaches are under financial
burdens. Everything—room,
board and tuition—has
increased, but not their budgets.

*women’s Athletics

Scholarships are down because
the money allocated has to be
distributed further. Standards
for scholarship money are
higher, further limiting the
coaches to potential athletes.

 

“A non-revenue athletic
department needs to set up con-
sistent expectations for each
program,” says Lady Panther
volleyball coach Shelton Col-
lier. Collier explained that the
university sets up certain goals
and objectives with the resour-
ces available in mind; a clearer
definition for each sport should
be stated, and then the com-
plaints could be lodged. He also
added that the university has
been very upfront and honest
about the situation of non-
revenue sports.

The general consensus
among the Lady Panther
coaches is that they feel limited
within their budgets. The
sports are most affected when
the. time comes for recruiting,

At Pitt Lacking Publicity

when the coaches are forced to
emphasize areas other than
athletics, such as academics, the
advantages of an urban setting
and the promise of the coaches’
support throughout four years
at Pitt.

These are not always enticing
aspects for the prospective stu-
dent athletes. Most of the pre-
miere athletes have their choice
ofseveral schools which often
include full scholarships. Lady
Panther coach David Belowich
says that Pitt may lose good ath-
letes who can go to direct com-
petitors for full scholarships.

“There’s no discrimination
problem at Pitt,” declares gym-
nastics coach Donna Sanft.
According to Sanft, all the pro-
grams are being hit “across the

board.” She says that recently-
hired director Ed Bozik will
upgrade the program consider-
ably. The changeover may be
difficult, but most of the
coaches have expressed optim-
ism for the future.

The only negative view given
by the athletes themselves con-
cerned the area of the “training
table.” The women interviewed
said they do not expect the pre-
ferential treatment that the
major revenue sports athletes

receive, but they do expect a lit-

tle more consideration.

At this point, the only differ-
ence between “training table”
and regular meals is the time
element.

Aside from the budget prob-

lems, the Lady Panthers feel the .

pinch in another area-—lack of
student support. Tennis player
Cathy Jacobson says that it
“hurts the psyched feeling that
an athlete needs to perform at
top level.” There is no encour-
agement. She offers that the
athletic department doesn’t
offer the necessary public rela-
tions to encourage student
attendance at women's sports
events.

This is an opinion voiced by
many of the women athletes
since they are dependent on self-
support and self-promotion. It
really is an oddity that there is
little support, especially in
sports such as volleyball and
swimming, which compete at
the national level.

Strike

_ Lacking

Progress  

continued from page fourteen

Go out and tell any other boss that
you want your salary plus a cut of
the gross volume and you will find
yourself in the unemployment line
right behind the banana salesman.

When the strike deadline grew
near, they dumped this demand for
a wage scale for players, again

.,i\,A,?§giainly to benefit the little guy. For

reasons unexplained, the owners
are also dead against the wage
scale.

The only things that seems to
come from the owners is a number.
For the last three weeks, jack Don-
ovan, the chief negotiator for the
owners, has been trying to give
away $1.6 billion. These are the
only words that seem to pass his
lips. Every other day he tells some-
one how the players won't accept
this $1.6 billion. He never says who
will get a cut of it or why they will
get it; he only says that if the play-
ers go back to the game, the owners
will do something with $1.6 bil-
lion. Confused? Join the club.

Not knowing all the particulars
and understanding few, I am not in
,_a position to offer a lot of helpful

 hints on how to resolve the strike. I

did have one thought that might
speed up the process a little,
though.

So far, Eugene Upshaw, lineman
for the Los Angeles Raiders and the
representative of the players, has
accompanied Players Association
negotiator Ed Garvey to all of the
bargaining sessions. Eugene, or
Mr. Upshaw, as all those in their
right mind call him, is about the
size of a small tank and packs about
the same punch. I think that Gar-
vey is afraid to compromise on any

‘Z5.
"-’-“J of the players demands for fear that

someone will be picking him up
with a spoon.

Just think, if the players would
have elected, say, a place-kicker
instead of Upshaw, there may have
never been a strike.

Dominating. This is the best way
to describe The Pitt News’ 49-0
annihilation of WPGH yesterday

in the continuing battle -of the"

media titans. A T _
George “Joe Willie” Holzer used
his howitzer arm to toss three
touchdown passes, while John
“Dud” Houston threw for two and
Todd “Call me .The Boss” Erkel
fired one, as The Pitt News’ version
of an aerial circus shredded the
totally inept WPGH secondary.
The defense looked like the one
that occupied Pitt Stadium on Sat-
urday afternoons, as The Pitt News
allowed a pitiful WPGH offense
led by Tom Walsh to net zero yards.
The swarming rush of Frank “Ital-
ian Stallion” DiGiacomo kept the

.WPGH quarterbacks running for _.Lg

their lives all afternoon. .

“Did they ever show up?”
Holzer, the self-appointed leader,
said after the game. “Seriously.
They are at great team. Both teams
played up to the best of their
abilities.”

It was an outstanding win for
Th_e Pitt News, considering several
star players, including Mary Kane,
Chris Clinton, Leslie Van Buskirk
and Barry Zasloff were laboring
through injuries. Along with brag-
ging rights on the fourth floor of
Schenley Hall, The Pitt News staff
will be on WPGH later this week
for one hour of unrestricted music.

But this is not the end; rather, as
new beginning. WPGH simply‘
doesn’t like to get slandered like
they were yesterday. No doubt Grif-
fiths, Walsh, Hellier and company
will issue another challenge in this
great rivalry, a rivalry that equals
those of Pitt-Penn State, Michigan-
Ohio State, Hampton-Richland—
well, you get the picture. 4

No doubt the rulers of this grand
rivalry—The Pitt News—wil1 be‘
on top again.

Field Hockey Tourn-

The Pitt Lady Panther Field
Hockey team had some success in
their own tournament, sandwich-
ing a victory between two defeats.

Pitt opened the match with a 5-2
loss to Ohio University. Lady
Panthers Margie Hall and Debbie
Madara scored Pitt’s goals. The
Lady Panthers rebounded to defeat
Slippery Rock 3-1 with Terry Zyga-
rowicz, Phyllis Kusuplus and
Joanne Patterson scoring goals.

The third game went into double
overtime, but Pitt was unable to
find the net as Frostburg handed
the Lady Panthers a 2-0 loss.

The Pitt field hockey team will
next see action on Oct. 15, when
they visit ‘Davis and Elkins.

“We used only two blockers at
the net,” Collier said. “Sally was in
the back court during all six rota-
tions. Now, I could have been made
out to be a fool or a genius, depend-
ing on how well this worked.

“Well, it did work and Sally was
phenomenal,” Collier said. “She
carried the whole team on her
shoulders during parts of the
game.”

“Sally is the best defensive player
on the team. Other players play
exceptionally well around her. She
makes the smart plays,” said Zack.

Collier said Penn State’s prob-
lems were exaggerated. The Lions
had originally cited four ill team
members and one player resigna-
tion as the source of their player
shortage. “Nobody was sick; they
came here with their full comple-
ment of players,” Collier said.

As the Panthers prepare for
upcoming matches, they are suffer-
ing from a player shortage. Of the
nine-player roster, only six or seven
are presently healthy, a fact that
has Collier concerned.

“I do not know what more they
can ask of us,” Collier said dryly. “I
want to recruit more players, but
need the resources to do so. We
have finally reached national rank-
ing, but with these injuries, how
long can we stay up there?

“We must establish and justify a
need for more money, and we
have—with a dominating team.
But we cannot continue playing
that type of volleyball with the loss
of players we have experienced.”

Both Kukalis and Zack see Col-
lier in a favorable light and realize
he has much to do with the team’s
rise over the past two years. To
them, though, it will mean more
personal sacrifices.

“If you would see what goes on
in the training room, you would
see there are a lot of personal
sacrifices made there,” said Zack.
“When other people know the
intensity, they develop a ‘hard as
nails’ attitude. They know what
they have to do and they do it.”
