This was announced at th
evening. ~ = A
The.Pan-Hel complaint

they _do not have the sufficient
time to devote to Greek Week was
answered by Alan Papernick, IFC
president. ‘ '

“We (fraternities) do as much
in a week as they (sororities)
_do in a semester,” he stated.
He revealed that he told the so-‘
rorities that “it (Greek Week)
would either be in the spring or
without them.’_’

Chris Gillotti,.chairman of the
Allied Collegiate Party, spoke to
the group on the coming cabinet
elections. He stated that in the
past the party, which represents
100 per cent of the student body,
has found greatest support in the
fraternities. .

He also announced a slating
meeting for this Sunday at the
Delta Sigma Phi house at 7 p.m.
Each fraternity was urged to send
two representatives to attend.

A motion was made by Bob
Magnano to have open rushing
for three weeks, from Oct. 13 to
Nov. 7.

Magnano sa-id, “Two weeks is
not enough time to look over the
men. Many good men will \be
overlooked.‘We will -lose them-
to the’_Independent_ Party and
make them stronger.”

Ray King, adviser to fraterni-
ties, gave a rushing report in
which he revealed that 229 men
pledged fraternities, as compared
with the 230 that pledged during
the fall semester of” last year.

The ﬁrst Shirt Satellite is fi-
nally a reality ! Just yesterday,
during their lunch hour, Van
Heusen scientists launched a
Van Heusen Century Shirt
into the stratosphere. It’s now
circling the earth 180,000 miles
up, in an orbit so large that a

‘ grown man couldn’t walk it,
even in a whole day! Travel-
ing at the legal 35 miles per
hour, it is expected that the
Van Heusen Century Shirt
Satellite will remain up there
in the blue beyond for at least
1200 years. And, with luck,
maybe 1201.

“But,” you will ask, “what
value will the Shirt .Satellite '
have for science?” Just this,
friend! It will further prove
the immutable law that the
soft collar on Van Heusen
Century Shirts won’t wrinkle
. . . ever! You"see, the slick
Van Heusen physicists have
attached an electronic
Wrinkle-ricter to the collar of
the Van Heusen C.entury

Shirt. This clever device will
constantly send back elec-
tronic reports on the condition
of the collar, so, for 1200 years,
we earthlings will have‘abso-
lute proof that the soft collar
on Van Heusen Shirts won’t
wrinkle . . . ever. Should you
ever have any doubts, just
drop in to the Van Heusen
office, and listen to the reports
coming back from the Shirt
Satellite.

One‘ more thing——the Van
Heusen Century Shirt Satel-
lite will drop back to the earth
in the spring of 3157 (possibly
3158) and you’re all invited to

“ the return party! If, in the

meantime, you want to see
the Van Heusen Century
Shirt, you can at your campus
haberdashery. He has them
in 5 collar styles, in white,
stripes and colors. $4 & $5.

.The' Michigan State Spartans will provide the season’s

highlight for Leo Bemis’ booters tomorrow. The Spartans

Michigan State is the number one soccer team‘in the na-

The Panthers will be fresh. off

It was Fernando who late in
the ﬁnal period was chosen to
‘take a free-kick at the Rockets
goal when a Slippery Rock
player was caught using his
hands. Fernando’s- kick sailed
high into the upper right hand
corner of the goal where the
'Rockets’ goalie had no chance to

knock the ball out. -
However, the boys from Slip-
p_ery R_ock were not to .be de-
nied. They came right back and
were constantly knocking at the
Panther goal. I _ - «
With one minute to go in the
game the Rockets’ outside right
lineman sent _a hard shot at the
Panther goal. Goalie Ron Gogai
had no chance to stop the ball.
The Panthers’ ﬁrst goal came
in the middle of the second per-
iod when it was Fernando who
scored. for the booters.

M _8€t'il_l,g_- With
Visiting Expert

A new phase of the University’s

Cultural and ‘Educational Ex-
change Program was announced
by Colonel J. J. Sustar on WQED
last Week.

Colonel Sustar expressed his be-
lief that “everyone should have
an opportunity to talk with peo-
ple from' foreign countries; The
best way to do this is to go to the
countries. Since very few can do
this, the next best thing is to meet
one of the many foreign experts
who visit Pittsburgh.

Anyone interested in inviting
a foreign expert to spend an eve-

_ning in his home should send a

post card to Colonel-—J._J. Sustar
in care of Television Station
WQED, 4337 Fifth Ave. .

The postcard should include
your name, address and phone
number. Also indicate the desired
nationality -and sex of your guest.
Mark the day and time that you
wish to invite the foreign expert.
If you want your guest to have
dinner with you, indicate on the

post card.
