Board
criticizes
Student
Health

By Jeff Tatusko
Contributing Editor

Members of the Student
Government Board expressed
concern over reports of poor
treatment at the Student Health
Service at last night’s meeting.

SGB President Julie Shepard said
that she has been ﬂooded with calls
this week from students complaining
about problems with the health
center.

“On Monday, one person who
said she couldn’t breathe said that
she had to wait for an hour to get an
appointment on Friday,” she said.
“Another person told me that after
the health center could not diagnose
her she went to [Presbyterian-
University Hospital], where she was
diagnosed for bronchitis.” O

SGB member Michael Cohen
received similar complaints. “[A
student] was treated for walking
pneumonia and was given
arythromycin and penicillin,” he
said. “She is allergic to both. ” Cohen
added that the health center
demanded that the student take the
prescribed medication, which
subsequently made her sicker.

Cohen criticized the center for
not treating students like adults.
“We are 18 years old,” he said. “We
know what we are allergic to. I’m
not a doctor, but I think that if
you’re going to get sick on the
medicine, then I don’t know why

/they’re going to prescribe it to you.”

Shepard said that the SGB should
check on the quality of the workers.
“At the very least, we need to see if
the staffing is up to par,” she said.
She also said that she was going to
contact Frank Carter, director of
health services, to start a forum on
student concerns.

Also at the meeting, SGB member
Katie Malaspina said that efforts are
underway to keep the South
Oakland shuttle running. “We're
going to talk with [public safety]
director [Bill] Brennan to see what
kind of options are available,” she
said.

“We’ve shown, by charting the
ridership every night, a sufficient
cause to keep it running,” Malaspina
said. “The week of Sept. 10 we had
613 riders, and the week of Sept. 17
there was a total of 607 riders.
These are substantial numbers.”

SGB member Michael Golden,
while endorsing the South Oakland
shuttle, also called for a similar
shuttle for the North Oakland area.
“There’s just as much crime in North
Oakland as in South Oakland, and
it’s a bigger place,” he said. “There
needs to be the establishment of a

$3000 bill

By Mindy Boffemmyer
Managing Editor ‘

Pitt’s student-operated radio
station, WPTS, has a $3,000 phone
bill for calls that station employees
didn’t make.

“There were two access codes
that ‘should have been turned off

WPT S station manager. _

Penman said that someone got

Laser show to highlight Homecoming

By Tammy Poole
Staﬁ" Writer

Students will have a few surprises to look
forward to during this year's homecoming
events.

Festivities for the affairwill begin next
week on Monday Oct. 8th.

“For the ﬁrst time this year, we will have
a laser show that will run simultaneously
with the fireworks display,” said Erin Carney,
director of the homecoming committee at
the Pitt Program Council.

During the laser show, which will take
place on Friday, Oct. 12th, Carney and her
committee“ are planning to have mirrors
placed in front of the Cathedral of Learning,
William Pitt Union and Hillman Library.

“I’m not really sure as of yet, but the plan
is to block off Bigelow Boulevard between

the union and the Cathedral so that students
can bring a blanket or chair out and sit while
watching the display,” Carney said. “In
order to see the lasers, you would have to be
more out in the open.”

The biggest event for homecoming, taking
place on Saturday, Oct. 13th, will be a
formal midnight cruise on the Gateway
Clipper Partyliner.

“This is totally different from what we've
done in the past. Last year we did have a
casino that was held in the union with a
band, and we did have food, but the whole
event was very informal,” Carney said. “This
year, instead of [holding it in] the union, the
casino will be held on the balcony of the
Gateway Clipper. The formal will contain a
full buffet dinner and a dance area.”

Although in past years homecoming has
included a parade, Carney said that she

doubts if the parade will ever come back to
Pitt again. _

“Two years ago, we put thousands and
thousands of dollars into the parade. You
call high schools all around to get children to
participate; you advertise, you pay your
organization to make ﬂoats, and all of this
takes tons and tons of work. And what
happens——— it rains out," she said.

Carney said weather is not the only factor
that creates problems in planning the parade.
Since traffic is so heavy on Forbes and Fifth
avenues, students are not very enthusiastic
about attending a parade before 9 in the
morning.

“The football game is always at noon,
12:30 p.m. or 1 p.m.'and no later than that in
the day, so you have to be totally off the
streets by nine o’clock, before traffic comes,”

Search for nursing dean begins

By Jennifer Skriba
For The Pitt News

Following School of Nursing
Dean Enid Goldberg’s
announcement of her retirement
injune 1991, a search committee
has been appointed to select and
interview qualiﬁed candidates to
fill her position.

“The job has been well-
publicized. However, the return
we get from [nursing journal]
advertisements and official
proclamations is usually very
small,” said Dr. Randy Juhl,
chairperson of the search

» committee.

Juhl encouraged the faculty and
the search committee to network
and call anyone they know across
the country who may be qualiﬁed
to fill the position. He said it is
usually through the network that
they find qualified candidates to
pursue.

In another attempt to find the
best person for the job, outside

Reserve University and Frances
Payne School of Nursing visited
Pitt last week to evaluate the
school and the opportunities it
has to offer.

“My international and national
meetings tell me that Pitt [School
of Nursing] is viewed as a very
strong school,” said Dr. Corinne
Barnes, interim director for the
doctoral program.

At a public hearing last week,
the faculty of the university’s
School of "Nursing voiced its
opinions and made suggestions
for the criteria it will be looking
for in a new dean.

Firstly, the faculty said the
prospective dean should perceive
what the role of the nurse will be
in the future so adjustments can
be made to further advance the
School of Nursing. The new dean
should have strong research
connections, good interpersonal
communication skills and should
encourage nursing as a multi-
ethnic profession.

The students want a dean who
is personable and has their

concerns in mind, according to
Carolyn R. Ressler, president of
the Graduate Nursing
Organization.

Finally, the university must be
willing to pay the dean a
competitive salary in order to
attract the best possible candidates
to the school.

Because of the vast number of
expectations for the new clean,
the outside consultants suggested
the possibility of an interim dean.

“We have been told to take as
much time as we need for the
process. Even if it takes two years,
we want to get the best possible
person for the job,” said Juhl.

Once qualified candidates are
chosen, they will be brought to
Pitt where they will meet with the
faculty of the School of Nursing.

Once the search committee
selects its ﬁnal candidates, the
senior vice president of the health
sciences, Thomas Detre and Pitt
President Wesley Posvar will
conduct further interviews and
will make the final selection.

North Oakland shuttle as

Golden also criticized the
handling of the selection of
the student representative
to the presidential search
committee. “There should
be a committee which
should be chaired by the
student government
president,” he said, “but I
think that people from other
organizations such as the
[Black Action Society] or
[Bisexual, Gay and Lesbian
Association] should sit on
the selections committee."

Cohen also addressed the
problem of Pitt students
who live at Carlow College
and their meal plans. He
said that students can

WPIC enforces bicycle parking

By Howard Goodman
For Tbe Pitt News

Inadequate parking is a
common problem for most
visitors and residents of Oakland,
but recently, bicycle riders have
been experiencing even more
difﬁculty parking their bikes.

Last Thursday, Hugh McGough,
a second-year law student,
experienced what he called an
“unpleasant event due to the
inadequate parking on campus.”

McGough said, “I locked my
bike to a trafﬁc sign on DeSoto
Street about six feet from the
curb and not on the sidewalk.

“I avoided parking against the
fence along the rear of [Western
Psychiatric Institute & Clinic]
where there are signs posted
which state that ‘This is not a
bicycle rack,’” he said.

After attending a seminar in
the building, McGough returned
to his bicycle. While he was
gone, two security guards from
WPIC chained the bike to the
sign so that he could not remove

McGough returned before the
ofﬁcers left his bicycle. He said
that one guard told him he was
lucky that he had returned,
otherwise, he might have had to
go to the WPIC security office to
recover his bike after they
removed their chain and cut his.

McGough said the guard told
him that if someone tripped on
his bike, WPIC was liable. The
guard also said that chaining
illegally parked bikes is a
common joint practice by WPIC
security and Pitt campus police.

He said, “They were putting a
sign on my bike that said ‘This is
not a bicycle rack.’ “ T h e
only reason I was parking there
was that the nearest campus lot
at the O’Hara garage was already
full. I witnessed students locking
their bikes on the construction
equipment and scaffolding that
is on both sides of the Western
Psych building. I felt that where
I parked was safer and would

cause no difficulties to
pedestrians.”
Don Charlay, manager of

support services and safety

services at WPIC, said that WPIC
is designated as a bicycle—free

area.

“There is a bike room in the
WPIC garage, but this is for
employees and staff members
only — not students,” Charlay

said.

Charlay said that it is a common
practice to put warning notes on
bicycles that are illegally parked.

Carney said. “How many students are going to get up at 8 in the
morning going ‘Yeeeaahh, I'm going to a parade.’ “

Although the PPC had decided that the parade just wasn’t a
good program for the students, Carney said that a lot of the
other events that took place at previous homecornings, will also
be held this year.

“As always, voting for the homecoming king and queen will
be held for two days. This year, students will be able to vote on
Monday and Tuesday, Oct. 8 and 9 between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m.
You can vote at either the lobby of the Towers, lower level of

If a bike is continually parked
there then it will be locked with
a chain, forcing the cyclist to
report to the WPIC security office
so that a face-to—face discussion
of WPIC’s policy can take place.

is to cut both chains and seize the

said. “The homecoming king and queen will be announced

be held on Monday and Tuesday in the union.
Pete McClure, recreation director of the PPC, said this is the

“If it is an immediate hazard
[we] will remove the bicycle by
cutting the chain right away. This
is not the preferred thing to do as

said.

sick], the morbidity associated
with it and perhaps on survival
time,” said Levy.

Drawing on two recent studies
in cancer, Levy related the
association between psychosocial
factors and disease outcome. “The
balance of the evidence suggests
there is a statistically signiﬁcant
association between la variety of]
psychosocial factors and cancer
outcome,” said Levy.

Citing one recent study in the
ﬁeld, Levy said, “Many of those
women who denied [cancer] or
showed a fighting spirit tended
to still be alive with no recurrences
10 years later.”

A study conducted by Levy and
a colleague in this ﬁeld replicated
the results. They studied a sample
of ﬁrst-recurrent breast cancer
patients (women who had gone
for a period of time without the
cancer and were presumably
cured) for eight years to see if
they could identify factors that
would predict or were associated
with length of survival.

They found the second most
important factor (after the length
of time the patient went disease-
free) to be what they labeled the
“joy factor." The joy factor is a
self—reported mood measure from
the patients which assesses their
hopefulness, optimism,
happiness and so on, Levy said.

“The joy factor was a surprise
to us. Higher joy scores predicting
longer survival," said Levy.

“Historically we’ve always
measured the dark emotions-
depression, anxiety and so on.
But why not look at the other
side of the coin? Why not also
suggest that positive emotions
may also play some role in our
biological status?" asked Levy.

Levy and her colleague began
by studying Natural Killer Cells—-
cells that play a surveillance role
in controlling the spread of early
disease—sinoe they are affected
by and regulated by stress
hormones and are relevant to

virus and malignancy control.

Levy found an association
between persistently low NK Cells
patterns in healthy volunteers
and a report of more serious
infectious illnesses on short-term
follow—up. These volunteers were
chronologically younger and
experienced a greater response
to stress. The strongest variable
was stress, according to Levy.

“Higher stress predicted more
illness morbidity over the follow
up,” she said.

With this study, Levy suggested
it may now be possible to identify
populations that are at a
particularly high risk because of
low NK Cell patterns, such as
ﬁrst- degree relatives of cancer
patients, individuals with chronic
fatigue and those infected with
the HIV virus, and intervene with
coping strategies.

“Can we intervene to affect NK
Cell activities, and if we do that
will that affect disease outcome?”

asked Levy.

first time that this event has taken place anywhere.

“It will be held from three p.m until ten p.m in the Assembly
Room of the union, so it should get a big response from
students,” McClure said.

There is no fee involved, and, according to McClure, anyone
can participate. Prizes and a chance to compete in the national
finals will be awarded to those who score exceptionally well in
the video games.

Then there is Pitt's Night Out, scheduled for Thursday, Oct.
11th. This event will allow Pitt students to get discounts at local
stores in Oakland. .

Carney and her committee members get together and go
around asking local businesses if they would be willing to give
students discounts during the week of homecoming.

“And they’re really cooperative," said Carney, a senior
majoring in psychology and English writing. “You won’t have
to show your Pitt I.D or anything like that, but you will have to

According to Levy there is now
hard, although very controversial,
evidence to suggest that
psychosocial intervention can
affect disease outcome.

Levy said, “The major
determinant of cancer outcome
is the biology of the tumor. This
is not a question of mind over
matter, but if behavior matters,
and it’s beginning to look like it
does, that’s important because
behavior can be changed.”

Whether that’ll make a
difference or not in terms of cancer
outcome— we’re just beginning
to address that question,” she
said.

After the keynote speech, the
seminar offered several
concurrent workshops on sources
of stress such as “Divorce,” “The
Workplace” and “Job Changes
and Unemployment.” The ﬁnal
event of the evening was a
workshop on stress reduction.

Access to student records limited to special cases

By Lane Hornfeck
Staﬂ" Writer

For the most part students’
records are off-limits to the
general public, but there is a
select group of people which
does have the authority to “check
them out” whenever they deem
it necessary.

According to Sam Conte of the
Office of the Registrar, “The
policy, which relates to university
duties, virtually deﬁnes who can

and cannot access the records.
Some of these people are
members of the Board of Trustees,
anyone approved under contract
in a faculty position, someone
employed as a temporary for
administration, any judicial body
which has been delegated from
the board and anyone in the
administration."

Faculty and members of the
administration have the ability
and authority to access any
student’s records. Usually a

student who would like to be in
a group or an activity must meet
certain academic requirements.
Therefore, administration or
faculty who are advising a group
or activity are granted permission
to verify a student’s grades.

The Family Educational Rights
and Privacy Act of 1974, also
known as the Buckley
Amendment, insures the rights of
students to confidentiality. This
act outlines how and when
records can be released. Students,

danger at all,” Kobulnicky said.
He added that the university
would not put the collection in
danger. “We couldn’t get along
without it,” he said.

Kobulnicky, who was the head
of the physical sciences library,
was promoted Sept. 7 in an
attempt to dispel tensions among
the system staff due to problems
with ULS Director William Roselle.
Roselle had taken time off for

health reasons, and the library
staff complained that day—to—day
matters were not being handled.

Kobulnicky will now manage
the ULS’s budget and space
resources and handle internal
problems within the library
system. He will also deal with
other matters such as program
activities and public services.

In doing this, Kobulnicky will
report directly to Provost Donald
Henderson instead of Roselle.

Roselle, though still director of
ULS, will be relegated to fund
raising and community relations.

Kobulnicky said that his first
priority is to fill the eight to 10
vacancies in the ULS.

Associate Provost Elizabeth
Baranger said , “In a library system
as large as this, there are always
going to be vacancies," she said.

She also said that the rest of the

staff seems to be pleased with the :

recent switch.

of course, have the authority to
release their own transcripts, but
the records can be accessed if
there is a “legitimate” concern.
Conte said, “It’s not easy to
access the records. The authority
given to these people is based on
legitimate educational interests
and purposes to complete their
university-outlined duties."
According to Dr. Susan Gisler,
the coordinator of judicial affairs,
the only thing that can be accessed
in thejudicial Affairs Board office

are the quality—point average and
the class rank of a student.

“And usually the only reasons
why people ever access those
records are if a student is
transferring to another institution
or for ROTC,” Gisler said.

“It doesn't seem to be an
infringement on the student’s
rights; we have had legitimate
reason [to access students’
records]. According to the law it
is not an infringement,” said
Conte.

WPTS’s phone bill usually runs

According to Penman, STS
officials do not believe that the
calls were made by one individual.
Penman agrees because of the
number of calls and the locations
from which they were made.

“Now the university is going to
try to collect some of the damages.
If anyone tries to use those

STS is taking this action in an

that would be a shame,” he said.

Oakland needs shuttle. ..

i In the South Oakland area, crime is a constant threat.
Students must always be wary of the threat of robbery,
rape and other violent crimes. For the time being,
however, students have the ability to avoid the streets
with a free ride home.

The South Oakland Shuttle completes its six week trial
period this week. The shuttle has been operating under
a plan instituted by the Public Safety Department and the
Student Government Board.

But this plan is in jeopardy because of a problem with
funding. With the end of the trial period comes uncertainty
as to whether the service can be funded in the future.

This decision lies mainly with Public Safety Director
William Brennan. It will be Brennan who will ultimately
decide whether or not the students should be able to keep
this service.

One of the keys to Brennan’s decision is the question
of whether the ridership of the students will be worth the
cost to run the shuttle. This question, however, was
answered last year.

At that time, the SGB conducted a survey asking
students if they would be interested in a South Oakland
Shuttle service. The results of this poll were overwhelmingly
in favor of the proposed shuttle program.

Last month, the ridership figures proved the validity of
that survey. During the week of Sept. 10, 613 people used
the shuttle. One week later, the number of riders totaled
607. These numbers indicate that students are willing to
use this service.

This breaks down to an average of 60 people per night
between Sunday and Thursday, with a ridership of 100-
120 people on weekends.

If he does find the need for the shuttle to be worth the
cost, then Brennan will have to find a source of income
to fund the service.

SGB Member Katie Malaspina says ' that they are
attempting to solve the problem by “looking into different
options as to where we can get funding.” She suggested
that the project could be financed as part of a dual budget
with another department in Public Safety.

The Oakland-Shadyside area has been experiencing a
crime wave over the past few months. This shuttle gives
South Oakland students the opportunity to bypass the
streets.

The responsibility of Public Safety is to protect the
students of this univesity. By keeping this shuttle, Brennan
would take a major step towards achieving this goal.

CISPES not given a fair chance

Reading the lies and distortions
written by Rob Lewis in his article
entitled “CISPES actually front for
communism” (9/ 20/ 90) made me
sad to think that an aspiring young
journalist would begin his career
employing such deceptive tactics.

In his assault on the Committee
In Solidarity with the People of El
Salvador (CISPES), a nationwide
organization of U.S. citizens
seeking peace in El Salvador, Mr.
Lewis claimed that he raised
questions about CISPES with me
and that many of my answers
“had glaring inconsistencies.” For
example, he asked me if
donations by CISPES to
humanitarian organizations in El
Salvador sponsored by the FMLN
are diverted into the war effort.
(The FMLN is a coalition of
organizations in El Salvador which
has been engaged since 1980 in
a civil war with the military
government.) Mr. Lewis claims
that, rather than answering his
question, I “hedged.” This is a lie.
I speciﬁcally said that of course it
was possible that such a diversion
is occurring, but that, if it is, I
have no knowledge of it and that
it is certainly not the intention of
CISPES that such a diversion take
place. This is a far cry from
“hedging.”

While Mr. Lewis disbelieved
my assertion that humanitarian
aid to the Salvadoran government
by the U.S. was diverted into the
war effort against the movement
for democracy, what he failed to
tell his readers is that a
congressional report documents
the truth of my assertions. The
report, co—authored by Sen. Mark
Hatfield (R-Ore.), Rep. Jim Leach
(R-Iowa) and Rep. George Miller
(D—Calif.) (hardly a group of left-
wing radicals) and issued by the
Arms Control and Foreign Policy
Caucus examined U.S. aid to El
Salvador and the assertions being
made by the then—Reagan
administration that 75 percent of
U.S. aid was spent for
humanitarian purposes and only

25 percent went to the military’s
war effort. The report concluded
that the truth was just the opposite
— that of the approximately $1
million per day of aid sent to the
Salvadoran government, about
75 percent is spent on the military
while only 25 percent is spent for
humanitarian purposes. Maybe
Mr. Lewis’ claimed “one hour’s
worth of research  in Hillman
Library” failed to turn up that
piece of information.

Even more offensive for its
downright dishonesty is Mr. Lewis’
accusation that I “refused to
answer to the charges raised by

. Letters

Collier and Horowitz (authors of
a book which apparently claims
that a “dissent paper” supposedly
drafted by State Department
employees critical of U.S. policy
in El Salvador was a KGB forgery).
Another lie. I never refused to
answer the question. I forthrightly
told Mr. Lewis that I had absolutely
no knowledge whatsoever about
any such “dissent paper.” Since
when does honestly admitting
that one does not know the
answer to a question constitute a
“refusal to respond”? Mr. Lewis
relies [on] the FBI for his
accusation of KGB forgery —— the
same FBI who in 1988
acknowledged that its massive
campaign of surveillance aimed
at CISPES [throughout] the 19805
was unwarranted and that all of
CISPES’ activities were lawful!
Mr. Lewis also asserted that I
“seemed offended that [he] was
asking these questions.” Quite
the contrary. I was thrilled that
The Pitt News had sent a reporter
to cover the CISPES
demonstration against U.S. aid to
the brutal government in El
Salvador. But after being asked

many questions about the FMLN
which I felt I was unqualiﬁed to
answer, I referred him and his
colleague to another CISPES
member with far greater
knowledge of the FMLN than I.
After all, I told him, the rally was
not about the merits of the FMLN
but about ceasing U.S. tax dollars
to a bloody dictatorship.

The most deceptive and

repugnant part of Mr. Lewis’ article
was his statements that the current
government in El Salvador was
“... one that the United States
should work with to end
dominance of the army ...,” and
that the so called election of “...
the right—wing Nationalist
Republican Alliance [ARENA]
candidate Alfredo Christiani” was
somehow “progress, ” In the same
paragraph Mr. Lewis admits that
ARENA is a reputed sponsor of
death squads!

The United Nations,
Organization of American States,
Amnesty International,
International Confederation of
Free Trade Unions and other
organizations have all reported
that the ARENA government has
increased the level of political
imprisonment, assassinations and
torture! Reporting on the
investigation of the hideous
torture and slaying of six Jesuit
priests, their housekeeper and
her daughter, the New Yorle Times
last Iulv 12 reported that “The
acknowledgements by President
g;hristiane gng ggglgnel Pence

romtes lin

eoogerated with the attempted

co;/er—un and may have
guthorized the ggeratign that
ended with he killing of the
priests.”

Contrary to Mr. Lewis’ advice,
it is our responsibility to call Sen.
Arlen Specter and ask that he
vote to cease the $1 million/day
of our taxes given to the criminal
ARENA government

Everything seems to be coming together
this season for Keith Dowling and the
men’s cross—country team.

The team is undefeated after three
meets and is en route to its best season
ever. It has overcome longstanding
obstacles by beating Penn State and
Bucknell and is looking forward to facing
nationally ranked Notre Dame and Central
Michigan at the Notre Dame Invitational
on Friday.

Dowling, a senior and the team’s lead
runner, is also undefeated and has his
sights set on an All-American finish at the
NCAA meet in November.

It’s not a mere coincidence that the
team, and Dowling as an individual, is
experiencing unprecedented success this
year. Each is dependent on the other.

It’s easy to see why the team as a
whole depends on Dowling. As the top
runner, he’s counted on to be there at the
front of the pack in every meet, and his
past accomplishments have given other
team members an incentive to push
harder. He was an All-American in the
outdoor 10,000 meter last spring and
also holds three individual school records:
the indoor 3,000 (8:11.07), the outdoor
5,000 (14:04.02) and 10,000 (29:08.28).
He is also part of the record-setting
4x1,600m relay team.

In particular, Dowling’s All-American
performance in track last spring has
made him a symbol of what can be
achieved through hard work.

“It’s really helped them to realize their
own abilities,” he said, “because they see
the work I did, and they know I wasn’t

oues oPit ports oa ion

much better than anybody else when I
started.”

The cross—country program, as it has
progressed at Pitt, has also done a great
deal for Dowling. In a sense, his own climb

to the top has paralleled the team’s.

After a successful running career at York
Catholic High School where he ran on two
state championship cross—country teams,
and was a track—and-field state champion in

   

the 5,200, Dowling wanted to become
part of a collegiate program that was still
in the process of growing.

He chose Pitt over Penn State for that
reason. Penn State was an established
program and was very good, but Pitt
offered him the chance to develop slowly
and more carefully.

“I don’t think I would’ve lasted too
long there, [because of the intensity of

their program,]” Dowling said. “But

since l’ve come here, not only have I
gotten more serious about running, but
Coach [Jim] Lear has become more serious
about it. He’s gotten tougher and tougher
on us each year, so that it’s been a
gradual increase. And along with the
program, I’ve made the step each year
and have kept pushing.”

Pitt’s low-key program has not only-

helped Dowling develop his running
talents properly, it has helped him and
the others to develop as people.

“We’re not running for glory, and
we’re not running for expensive shoes
or expensive sweats,” he explains.
“Unlike some of the bigger schools like
Penn State, we don’t have a lot of money.
So we’re taught to run for the right
reasons.

“To me, it’s all about improvement and
showing absolute fearlessness against
competition that’s overwhelming.
Running has taught me to be tough
when things look really bad. It’s really
helped me mature as a person.”

At the start of the season, Dowling said
he saw something special in the team
that he had never seen before. “I just
looked over them, and by the looks on
their faces it seemed like these guys

They’re juniors and seniors, and
it would make no sense for them

Over the past seven years, Mark
Jackson has compiled an
impressive .848 winning
percentage (291-52) while leading
a Pittsburgh collegiate baseball
team into the national spotlight.

Unfortunately for the University

 of Pittsburgh, Jackson achieved

all of his victories and accolades
as the head coach of the Point
Park Pioneers and not the
Panthers.

Du ring that period, the Panthers
stumbled through an 82-112
record (.423) under longtime head
coach Bobby Lewis, meanwhile
losing the interest of the student
body and the community.

In order to inject new blood
into the struggling baseball
program, Lewis, Pitt’s head coach
for 36 years, resigned, and the
University of Pittsburgh quickly
signed Jackson as its new coach.

‘‘I’m not concerned with the
past,” said Jackson. “I’m
concerned with the future. I feel

good baseball team, and I want
to be a part of it.”

Jackson said that one of the
main reasons he came to Pitt was
because it had a bigger program
than Point Park, and Pitt has the

teams and win,” said Jackson. “In
fact, Point Park was able to
compete against many bigger
schools.”

Jackson claimed, however, that
he had no plans of enticing his
former players (those still on the
Point Park team) to come and
play for him at Pitt.

“Ethically, they’re there, and
I’m here,” said Jackson. “Most of
them are close to graduating.

That doesn’t necessarily mean
that Jackson will ignore talent at
local colleges, however. Junior
colleges, that is.

“I feel that junior colleges are a
good place to recruit talent. There
are some mature players at the
junior—college level,” saidJackson.
“Most of my recruiting, though,
will focus on high—school players.”

Sports Medicine Institute
offers new walk—in clinic

By Spencer Borisoff
Staff Writer

Football season is a very rough
time of the year. It’s the time of
year when student-athletes drop
to the ground like autumn leaves,
clutching a bump, a bruise, a
break or a sprain— literally falling
victims of pain.

In an effort to cushion the fall.
the Sports Medicine institute at
Pitt is offering its assistance to
student—athletes through a walk-
in clinic.

According to Lisa Rossi, the
assistant director of the Health
Sciences News Bureau at Pitt’s
medical center, the clinic is
particularly beneﬁcial to an athlete
not only because it allows an
injured athlete to see a sports-
medicine specialist, but also
because the clinic works with the
athlete in returning them to their
sport.

The chief specialist is Dr. David
Stone, the clinic’s medical director
and former medical consultant to
the New York Giants. Athletic
trainers are on hand to assist
Stone as well.

The clinic, open from 5 to 7
p.m. on Saturdays, is a “state-of-
the-art facility” that has many

 

advantages over an emergency
room, according to Rossi.

“An emergency room may not
know the latest in sports medicine,
despite the fact that its staff is
trained to treat a wide variety of
injuries,” Rossi said. “lt’s best to
see someone who specializes,”
she continued.

Stone concurred. “We feel our
clinic provides a better alternative
:0 an emergency room. which is
not adequately staffed or
equipped to handle sports
injuries,” he said.

The clinic’s services are
available to anyone. However,
the clinic is geared toward the
athlete who has been injured
during a game or who becomes
increasingly uncomfortable after
a game.

The clinic will run up until
Thanksgiving, according to Rossi,
since it is the first time this service
has been offered and because
most injuries occur during football
season.

It can be found at the Sports
Medicine Institute in the Center
for Sports Medicine and
Rehabilitation, Baum Boulevard
at Craig Street. Appointments are
net required.

This date in Pitt Football History:
OCt0b€l’ 4, 1917

Pitt opened its season with a 14-9 win over West Virginia.
The Panthers went on to post a 9-0 record.

were just sick of getting beat. A
lot of them had really run over
the summer and just did whatever
they had to do to be better.”

The need to be recognized was

 fulﬁlled early in September at the

Spike Shoe Invitational at Penn
State when Pitt beat Penn State
for the first time since 1975.

“After the meet I got all the
guys together, and I was really
choked up because it was the
first time we had beat Penn State
in 15 years. It was really special.”

Aside from his personal goal of
achieving All-American status in
cross country this year, Dowling
would rather focus on the team’s
goals and aspirations.

“My feeling is, the better I do,
the better it is for the team. So I try
not to think that I’m undefeated,

team. Sometimes Mr. Ego comes
in there, and you can’t help that,
but you can’t let it get to you.
There's a lot of runners in this
country, and you can never think
that you know it all because once
you do, you get burned.”

This past summer, Dowling was
invited to spend a weekend at
the Olympic Training Center in
Colorado Springs, Colo., along
with some of the other top 5,000-
and 10,000-runners in the county.
The experience made him realize
the significance of what he’s
accomplished as a runner.

“I ‘m sitting there in a room
with a group of guys that I once
read about and never thought I’d
meet, never thought I'd be as
good as,” he said. “But there they
are, sitting next to me, and we’re
becoming friends. I’m getting the
phone numbers of coaches across
the country, and they're telling
me that I have Olympic potential.
I would’ve never thought that
would happen.”

An English writing/
communications major, Dowling
plans to graduate next fall. But
from there on, it’s more training
— hopefully for the 1992
Olympics.

“I figure that I’ve put too many
years into running for me to just
get my degree and go out and
start looking for a job,” he said.
“I’d feel as if I really didn't
accomplish as much as I'm
capable of. ...”

Jackson feels that the addition
of the Charles L. Cost Sports
Center will greatly enhance his
in- and out—of—state recruiting.

“It is great to be able to show
a young athlete a facility like this.
We'll be able to use it a lot in

January and February, setting up

I batting cages, and that will show

a potential recruit that Pitt is
dedicated to winning," he said.

Even thoughJackson has many
hopes for the future, he doesn't
lose touch with reality.

“I realize that baseball is not
going to be the biggest sport on
the Pitt campus, but it deﬁnitely
can be the biggest spring sport.
College baseball is taking off all
over America because of ESPN,
and I think that it can gain

popularity at Pitt, too.

“If my players work hard, then
the team’s fate is up to them. If
they put in the time and really
work, and they follow what I
teach them, then there is no telling
how far this team can go.”

A lot of campus rapes start e

Whenever there's drinking or drugs. things can get out of hand.
So it's no surprise that many campus rapes involve alcohol.

But you should know that under any circumstances. sex’ without
the other persons consent is considered rape. A felony. punishable
by prison. And drinking is no excuse.

Thats why, when you party. it's good to know what your limits are.
You see. a little sobering thought now can save you from a big
problem later.

Riffs, Reggae and The King: An interview with Dread My elin.

By Cheryl Neidlinger
sum‘ Wﬁter

If you've never heard of Dread
Zeppelin, you won’t believe me
when I tell you about them.
They're just another part of the
genre ofLed-Zeppelin-inﬂuenced
acts, but with a twist: They do
Zep covers, only reggae style,
with a lead singer who is an Elvis
impersonator. The crazy thing
is... it works!

Dread Zeppelin, whose
members include Ed Zeppelin,
Jah Paul Jo, Put-mon, Carl Jah,
Fresh Cheese & Cheese and, of
course, Tortelvis, have found
themselves with a successful new
release an IRS Records
(appropriately named Un-led-Ea)
and two very successful singles
that received a lot of airplay across
the country. They have drawn
critical acclaim from many,
including Robert Plant, who calls
them “one of my favorites." Their
year-long tour will bring them to
Pittsburgh at Grafﬁti on Oct. 7.

A few weeks ago, I had the

pleasure of speaking with
guitarist/keyboardist Jah Paul Jo
who called from the IRS offices in
New York. Talking to him was
like listening to the album —not
an ounce of seriousness, but loads
of fun!

PITI‘ NEWS: I guess my ﬁrst
question is ‘How did this
whole thing happen?

' DREAD ZEPPELIN: Well, you

know, I was in a band called the
Reggae Blades. Have you heard
of them?

No, sorry.

Well we had a song that got
pretty high up on the charts in
Canada; it was; called “Cheeze-
ums”. It went up to #280... we’re
all pretty proud of that.
Anyway, we were starving, not
making much money, and we
were driving our Ford Pinto one
day in beautiful Temple City,
Calif., where Tortelvis is from.
Next thing we knew, he backs
into us in his milk truck. Pintos
generally explode on impact; I
guess that was our version of
living on the edge. We conld

have been blown to Kingdom
Come (no pun intended, of
course). Tortelvis ran out, and of
course you can tell by his photos
he’s an incredibly charismatic
man, and he tells us that he had
had this visitation from Elvis. The
King himself had a concept, he
told us, so he hired us on the
spot. He knew we were the ones.

What do they call that when 

things happen like that...

serendipity?

Anyway, we figured we may as I

well go with the man. Obviously
we had nothing better to do.
So who is this Tortelvis guy?

I’ve heard all of these stories '
—— that he’s the illegitimate '

son of Elvis, that he once

knew Elvis... What should I -

believe?
Well now, the last story I heard,
and the one I think is probably
most true, is that he was, in fact,
created by aliens. The way it
goes, from what I understand, is
that he orbited the earth for several
years in Skylab. Then, before it
fell, he was jettisoned out in
some sort of pod and he landed
in the backyard of Daddy T elvis.
Daddy Telvis raised him from a
small child.

Now Daddy Telvis recognized
that when T ortelvis was about 8

or 9 years old that he had this
beautiful singing voice, and he
knew right then that he had been
modeled after Elvis Presley
because he looks so much like
Elvis and sounds so much like
him. Daddy Telvis doesn't speak.
He uses a bizarre form of hand
signs that he’s created himself,
and he somehow communicated
through these hand signs that

Tortelvis was, in fact, created lg’;-

aliens in the likeness of the most
charismatic man that ever walked
the earth, which is of course,
Elvis Presley.

Has Tortelvis ever been
acquaintedwith orhashe ever
spoken to Elvis?

Well, now he claims that in 1977,
Elvis Presley walked up to him in
Hollywood, Calif., and said to
him, ‘Do Led Zeppelin songs the
way they were meant to be, in
reggae style.’ That was
supposedly his first visitation.

The Amen Corner

By Mindy Boffemmyer
Managing Editor

Kuntu Repertory T heatre’s

production of James Baldwin’s
The Amen Corner is an
emotionally draining experience.

The play maintains an intense
amount of energy through some
genuinely hilarious moments and
others that are genuinely tragic.

There is a point during the
third act which the play becomes
actually heart-wrenching.

Sister Margaret’s dam is finally
breaking as she sits at the kitchen
table with her older sister Odessa,
recalling a scary old blind woman

from their childhood
neighborhood.
4 Margaret remembers their

father saying the blind woman
had a sad house because there
weren’t any men in it and says
that she now realizes that life
consists of a long battle with
men.

After leaving her drunken
husband years earlier to raise
their son on her own, she has
devoted her life to serving the
Lord as pastor of her Harlem
church.

At this point, as her husband
lies dying in the next room and
her sister tries to prepare her for
the fact that her congregation
plans to oust her, she comes to
the tearful realization that the
Lord is a man too.

T ammy Todd is in a state near
hysteria throughout her
performance as Sister Margaret.

She presents, with an
undeniable understanding of her
character, a comical and sad
version of the uptight pastor

whose life is suddenly coming .

unglued.
Sister Margaret devotes a large
portion of her endless energy to

trying to protect her 18-year-old
son, David (played by Dwayne
Fulton), from the world that
consumed her husband years
earlier. But David has aspirations
to follow his father’s footsteps
and become a musician.

Sister Margaret fears that racy
musical instruments (like the
piano) offend God and destroy
men. She disapproves of the
lifestyle her son wants to adopt.
And this pushes him further
toward the door.

Bob Gore portrays her husband
Luke, who returns home to be
with his family when he dies.
Luke attempts to convince his
feisty wife to release her grip on
their son and allow him to create
a life for himself. But Margaret
isn’t easily convinced of anything.

Meanwhile, Margaret’s church
is in political turmoil. SisterMoore,
a church elder (played by Teri
Bridgett), has allowed power to
corru pt her ordinarily good nature
and is trying to tug leadership of
the church from Sister Margaret’s
hands.

Sister Moore presents a virginal
image that is progressively tainted
under the inﬂuence of Sister and
Brother Boxer (Deborah Sims and
David Early), also church elders.
The trio believes that Sister
Margaret has allowed her family
crises to steer her from the path
of righteousness.

Throughout this Series of
tragedies Margaret’s wise older
sister Odessa (Linda Hunt) serves
as her support system.

Another great feature of this
play is the gospel music
performed by members of the
cast and The Derryck Tines Music
Ensemble.

itzmttu iltepertutig anti Qtity iiiheatte celebrate 17th season

Daytrips

By Mindy Boffemmyer
Managing Editor

Pat loves her mother and grandmother, but
she can’t help dreaming of smothering them
with her pillow, letting the house burn down
around them or leading them too far out into the
river where they’ll drown.

Daytrips, which is opening City Theatre Co.’s
17th season, is a jarring account of three
generations of women: Ree, a victim of
Alzheimer’s disease; Rose, her mother, who is
becoming senile and waiting to die; and Pat,
Ree’s daughter, who serves as caretaker for both

women.

Pat is plagued by dreams of killing her mother
and grandmother, whose needs and disabilities
cause her unendurable stress.

   
 

Ree has self-destructive tendencies and requires
almost constant attention. She runs away and
gets lost, sits down in the middle of the street and
tries to jump out of moving cars.

As if that isn’t enough to occupy Pat’s time,
Ree can read her thoughts and knows that her
daughter contemplates killing her.

Between Rose and Ree, they can’t keep straight
the fact that Pat is, in fact, Pat and always confuse
her with other family members.

Ree confuses her daughter with Olivia, a
favorite aunt. Rose thinks her granddaughter is
actually Helen, her dead daughter, and can’t
understand why she won’t move back home.

The plot revolves around their daytrips to the
grocery store, to the homes of relatives and to
the pharmacy. Most often, the mishaps that
occur on their daytrips would be hilarious if they
weren’t so depressing.

Algebra Suicide plays the Upstage

By Manny Theiner
Sta_[}‘W1-lter

What do you get when you
cross a poet with a statistician?
The punch line is Chicago’s
Algebra Suicide — a band, a
poetry reading, a slide show
and a performance-art event
all rolled into one. The
husband/wife team of Don
Hedeker and Lydia Tomkiw
just ﬂew in from a successful
tour of Europe, and boy, are
their arms tired.

But seriously folks, Tomkiw
fondly recalls the warm

reception that Algebra Suicide
received in Belgium, Germany,
France and Switzerland. “There
were packed crowds at many
of the shows. I've always found
it strange, since it's spoken
word, that non-English
speaking audiences seem to
understand us so well. They
pick up on a basic connection.”

The connection in Algebra
Suicide involves the
interlocking of Tomkiw’s stark
but often darkly humorous
verse with the catchy, brooding
pop hooks of Hedeker’s guitar
playing and drum

programming. Add the
stunning visuals, and they have
quite a unique pop~artistic
ﬂavor, which interested the
Belgian label Body Records
(oddly enough, a subsidiary of
the Antler/Subway electronic-
dance conglomerate) in
releasing Algebra Suicide’s
fourth full-length effort, an LP
called Alpha Cue.

Algebra Suicide has also put
out a live CD on Germany’s
Priapismus label, a cassette and
LP with U.S. labels RRR and
Cause & Effect and three seven-

Barbed Wire Dolls
Barbed Wire Dolls EP
Get Hip Records

I've always loved female rock
bands. There’s something
seductively erotic about women
in tight leather with frothy hair
that blows the already present
sexuality of rock right into
oblivion. y

It’s a shame that more female
groups don’t exist. The reason
more bands of this sort don’t
make it very far is ‘probably
because they don’t garner the
respect (respect they deserve)
from a male—dominated industry.
The Barbed Wire Dolls have
staked their claim on being the
only truly sexy rock ‘n’ roll band
in Pittsburgh. Face it, they ooze
sensuality, right along with some

 

heavy hardcore rock.

This is the grunge-level punler
rock that got lost somewhere
among the thrash—metal craze.
It’s heavy and can be a bit
plodding at times, but it represents
an era in music that most, aside
from the diehard punk fans, have
forgotten.

There are four nifty tunes on"v

this EP. The lead “Killing Me”
was also included on last year’s
compilation Hey Spike, When Ya
Gonna Burn Dat Der ]acleet?.
For a group of girls who have
never had any formal musical
training —— they just picked up
their instruments and started

playing — they sound wonderful _,..

recorded. They’ve managed to ’
capture the whiny, complaining
style circa the Runaways and
Wendy O. Williams.

This is funky bubble gum punk
laid to rest on hot pink, bubble

The Barbed Wire Dolls will be
celebrating their record release

at The Upstage on Saturday, Oct. , 

6. Also performing at this over-21
show will be the Monomen and

Zeppelin

Continued from page S-2

So it was all Elvis’ idea?
Yes, it was. Now, the latest thing,
now this is really interesting, is
that Tortelvis just had a visitation
again the other day. He says that
Elvis wants everyone to know
that he was instrumental in signing
David Bowie to RCA Records.

I think Elvis is trying to get out
to people that he has very good
musical taste and good musical
ideas. I think whoever chose his
music in the early ‘70’s and
whoever made those movies kind
of suppressed Elvis. He had a lot
of musical ideas that never came
out.

Was Elvis a Zeppelin fan, then?
Oh, Elvis was a big Led Zeppelin
fan. He did meet the guys in Led
Zeppelin, and Robert Plant was a
huge fan of Elvis and still is!
Robert Plant has called us his
favorite group, you know? He
has been incredibly helpful and
he’s just the nicest guy in the
world. He’s worn our T—shirt on
magazine covers, and in fact, in
the last Rolling Stone he said the
only wayyou can do Led Zeppelin
songs these days is the way Dread
Zeppelin does ‘em. He said they
were doing reggae versions of
“Stairway To Heaven” back when
Tortelvis was yet young and thin.
I’m on the Tortelvis diet now.
I’ve gained 20 pounds in three
weeks. Have you read about this
diet?
No, tell me.
Well, t.here’s no grains, no
greens... greens are just not to
eat. Farm animals eat green things.
Now, the new thing is the
“Cheeseburger Tortelvis”: A
double cheeseburger dipped in
batter, deep-fried and covered
with preserves. It’s kind of like a
Tortelvis Monte Cristo. Now that
we're all on this diet, I’m sure
they’re going to have to start
reinforcing the stage.
So is Elvis really dead, then?
What about all of the Burger
King stories?
Tortelvis says that Elvis is
definitely dead. That’s kind of
sad, you know?As for the Burger
King sightings, I don’t think it's
too unreasonable to think that
the fine people in Kalamazoo,
Mich., were seeing things.
Besides, you know, if Elvis Presley
were alive, and he was trying to
hide, I think he would shave his

_ sideburns and try anew hairdo,

and maybe not wear the Vegas
outﬁts. Don’t you think?

I noticed thatyou co—produced
the album. Did you have a lot
of say in what material was
recorded or how it was done?
Yes, but I work very closely with
Tortelvis, of course. With
producing the record I'm kind of
in charge of the band, but I’ve got
to listen to everything T ortelvis

says and get all of these things

down. Who knows, if Elvis came

to him and said, “Do something
different" maybe we'd have to
completely change. Maybe we’d
have to do Black Sabbath polka

style.

Whatwillyou do if that doesn’t
happen and you run out of
good Zep material? What will
you do then?

Daytrips
Continued from page S-3

, Ree can't get in and out of the car or use the bathroom on her
own. She drops, rnisplaces and accuses people of stealing her
things. Rose is completely confused, morbid and constantly
talking about death — her own and everyone else’s.

Director Susan Chapek made excellent casting decisions with
Daytrips. The cast and the ways in which Chapek directed them
to move about the stage make this production a success. The
dream sequences are especially well-directed. <8

The four women who comprise this cast are talented? and
convincing and interact very well together.

Janet Morrison plays Pat (:1 character whose monologues bear
a striking resemblance to Bong Water songs) with an excellent
mixture of sympathy, frustration and guilt.

Chapek makes exceptional use of the narrator, played by
Elizabeth Fuller, who is essentially an extension of Pat. The
narrator serves to give Pat’s psyche some exercise.

Fuller and Morrison, as two facets of one character, complement
one another perfectly. Evie McElroy is funny and totally convincing
as Rose. Ann Mufﬂy does an exceptional job portraying Ree, a
difficult role. She has established a solid character who is
experiencing tremendous confusion, and never ventures from it.

Although the play itself is moving, City Theatre really made
something of it. I can easily imagine other companies failing to
produce a good version of Daytrips.

The reasons for City T heatre’s success with the production
include a great cast and some “signature” City Theatre devices.
For example, the set was done in a minimalist style, leaving a
considerable amount to the imagination. The dream sequences
were produced in that overwhelmingly eerie City Theatre
fashion: dark, colored lighting and bizarre music all in a space
as small as your living room.

For these touches, City Theatre deserves applause for Daymps,
which will run through Oct. 28.

provocative and uplifting play,
though Lillie maintains that the
company deserves all the credit.
(Lillie had to leave production
early for personal reasons, and
the company largely directed
itself, she said.)

One of Kuntu’s reasons for

opening its 17th season with The
Amen Comeris that the play is an
African-American‘ classic,
according to Gore.
V The company had originally
planned to perform Blues forMr.
Charlie, also by Baldwin. Lillie
said she felt the play’s themes
would be appropriate with the
recent resurgence of racism. But
The Amen Comer was chosen
instead for casting reasons.

Gore explained that the Kuntu
Repertory Theatre was born in

1973 when a group of African-
American writers and actors felt
that there wasn’t enough for them
to do in Pittsburgh.

The Amen Corner will run at
Stephen Foster Memorial Theatre
through Oct. 6, which means
you've only got three
performances left. And this one is
a must-see.

About The Amen Comer,
Baldwin writes:

“There has certainly not been
enough progress to solve Sister
Margaret's dilemma: how to treat
her husband and son as men and
at the same time protect them
from the bloody consequences
of trying to be a man in this
society.” ‘

But the duo won't let the
dearth of hometown interest
bother them since they are
appreciated in cities like
Pittsburgh, where Algebra
Sgiicide has played to
enthusiastic 100-plus
audiences three times at CMU,
the Wightman School and
the Sonic Temple, as well as
having received Top 10 play
list honors at WRCT and
WYEP for Alpha Cue.

Algebra Suicide performs

Other fun stuff. Like, after the
tour, we're going to start on a
movie.

Oh, really? What kind?

Well, we're really not sure yet,
but we know the title will be
“Slambake.” I don’t want to do it
unless we can get Ann-Margret,
though... Maybe there would even
be a spin—off series on TV.
How do you handle groupies?
Led Zeppelin was really into
the groupie thing. Are you?
We've got a couple men hired to
deal with them. One is Charlie
Hodge, who is best known as the
one who hands Tortelvis towels
on stage. They make sure the
women don’t get back to us
because they could throw things
off; you know, ruin our discipline.
Basically, they just give ‘em a pat

Dread Zeppelin home game and
send them on their way.

What can we expect to see in
your concert in Pittsburgh?
We'll do what’s on the album and
some other stuff that’s not on the
album. We do “Misty Mountain

Hop”, we do “Stairway to’

Heaven”, we do “America the
Beautiful” (that’s a special one),
and we do a medley of a lot of
other Zeppelin songs. The show
all singing, dancing, T ortelvis ——
it’s really an incredible show!

You know, I've heard reports
that some radio stations have

had to drop Dread Zeppelirtg

from their rotation, because
they've gotten angrymlls from
diehard Zeppelin fans who
called it “sacrilege” to play the
songs that way. Others aren’t
so angry, but have mixed
feelings about it all. What do
you think?

Well, now that’s a cryin’ shame. A
People should understand that./~a-.

this is a homage to Led Zeppelin
and Elvis and Bob Marley and all
of reggae music. Robert Plant has
said in magazines (about Dread
Zeppelin) that for some of the
material, he wishes they had done
it the way we've done it. T hat's an
incredible compliment. What I'd
like to say to those people is

“Give it a chance. Don't get so,“

angry. We're just here havin' fun,
playin’ good music.
