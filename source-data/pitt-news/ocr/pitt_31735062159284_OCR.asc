for in their amended constitution last

Disagreement marked this initial
election as several members took
issue with President Howard Green-
berger’s right to nominate from the
floor the students who polled a high
number of votes in last Spring’s
election. The students were nom-
inated, however.

The constitution, before it was
amended, provided that vacancies
would automatically be filled by
"that candidate who at the preceed—
ing general election received the
vote next highest to that obtained
by the last duly elected member,”
provided that the various schools
would retain their proportinate mem-
bership.

remaining days if the trip is to go
on.

If the 300 tickets are not sold,
the trip is off as far as the Penn-
sylvania Railroad and the Sun-
Telegraph, joint sponsors of the
trip, are concerned.

This trip is entirely separate
from the other Sun-Telegraph spon-
sored trip to Philadelphia for $22.75.

“We look on this as an experiment
for future football trips for Pitt stu-
dents,” Ewart said. “Student Con—
gress urges all loyal supporters of
the team to take advantage of the
bargain offered.”

The $10.35 charge for the trip
is about $2 less than the regular
one-way fare to Philadelphia. An
additional $3.90 pays for the ticket
to the game. Both tickets may be
purchased at the Student Desk.

The train will leave Union Sta-
tion shortly after midnight Friday,
Oct. 28 and arrive in Philadelphia
7:30 Saturday morning. The return
trip will leave Philadelphia a little
before midnight Saturday, and reach
Pittsburgh at 7:30 Sunday.

A big pep rally sponsored by the
railroad will precede the departure
of the train Friday night.

Credit Plan

Today is the last day for stu-
dents to buya 1950 Owl for $5. For
veterans a special credit plan has
been arranged so that they can take
advantage of the 35 rate.

To buy on this‘ plan, the veteran
should go to the Student Desk to-
day, sign for a book with an Owl
salesman, and make his picture ap-
pointment. He will receive no re-
ceipt until a down payment is made.

Beginning next week, the regualr
Owl will cost $6. There will be no
change in the price of the deluxe
edition which costs $6.50. I

When queried by the student legi- *

Gets Investigated

A check with the Better Business
Bureaushowed that the organiza-
tion Was investigating the NCC on
the West Coast, Miss Diemert said.
The NCC is under U.S. Congres
sional investigation, Scioscia ad-
mitted to a News reporter, but his
lawyer advised him to continue with
his plans.

"I can put this over without the
approval of Student Congress or;
the administration; it will be harder
but I can do it,” Scioscia said,
when he was told to bring additional
information for the next meetings’?

He said he had over a thousand
dollars tied up in this venture and
didn’t intend to quit now.

Student Factions Split
On Victory Rally Hours  

In a scene rivaling that of a U.S. Congressional investigating
committee, Student Congress, Monday, approved a motion to send
a letter to the board of deans stating that one hour is not enough
time in which to hold a victory ce lebration.

The shouting and name calling started when Dave Fox, assem-

blies chairman, told Congress that
the board of deans had allotted
three hours for pre-game and vic-
tory rallies instead of the seven
requested. '

Bill Swanson, vice president,
immediately proposed a motion to
draft a letter to the deans empha-
sizing the impossibility of con-
ducting a victory celebration'in
one hour. The motion was /seconded
by Don Ewart.

The official class dismissals
call for one hour pep rallies pre-
ceeding the Ohio State and Penn
State" games and the other hour

   

for a victory celebration following 5
a Panther upset victory. 5
Fox opposed sending the letterﬂ
He said, the fact that a one hour
rally has never been attempted
doesn't prove that it is impossible.
At this point Ewart leaped to his
feet. He claimed the band would
not have time to gather -its instru-"
ments from the stadium, attend the
rally, and then return the equip-ﬂ

ment in an hour's time.
Fox replied that the time of the .,
tally would be immediately after’

Not “Upright Citizens

- Morgantown came close to being invaded a second time in a
jweek Friday night. .
The first entrance last week by the football team and its
followers was as sane as the later one was insane. A group of
foolhardy Phi Eps, with publicity on their minds, cooked up a
plot on the West Virginians’ goalposts. Oh the heels of a stag
party they figured to head for the hills and nab the uprights. But
wiser heads, mainly the fraternity officers, prevailed, and the
. idea did a proper fizzle. _

ii If the expected perpetratorsof the deed look back in retro-
spect, they/should see how‘ ridiculous their shot at the Mountie
posts would have been. "If not, it leads us to believe more strong-
ély that all they were interested in was the notoriety. Why else
“did they go out of their way to let the News in on the plot, even
though in confidence, and arrange for a reporter and photographer
(“to accompany them?

As it was, the News representatives stood idly around while
{the officers, led by President Howard Greenberger, squelched
the trip. ’

A Pitt entered the WVU game a respectable favorite and won it
after fighting off the determined host team. Even immediately
after the game, an assault on the uprights would have been silly.
’A couple-of Pitt men with more guts than good sense tried it.
_‘ But to attempt it nearly a week later would have only added
more fuel tothe burning cheeks of respectable Pittites, disgusted
with recent actions’ of some brain-weak rah-rah boys in raping
their own home field by removing the goalposts.

I-Doing Everybody Good

j Two school-wide drives, one drawing to a close this week,
L; the other opening in two weeks, makes Pitt students appear
éstaunch supporters of good government. »

M "In boosting these campaigns, they are “providing for the
‘health and welfare.” That is, their own health by taking advan-
tage of the Diabetes Detection Drive that has been offered here
by the health services of the school, and somebody else’s wel-
fare bygcontributing to the Chest drive coming up Nov. 2.

if This is one of those unusual situations, where the student
can help others and help himself, too. And there is no guestion
about theivalue of the two programs. Diabetes, rapidly becoming

»o'ie of the more common ailments plaguing us, and, if detected

iearly, can be more easily relieved and sometimes cured.

 The News has already voiced its approval of the Chest drive,’
/as a plan that takes the pain out of soliciting funds by hitting
he students only once a semester, by grouping the worthwhile
harities together, and by having the best chance of reaching the
rescribed goals.

Pick Up the Slack

. Students have thrown a slight scare into the backers of the
Penn game train trip by seemingly ignoring the plan.

I By Tuesday only 68 special bargain tickets had been sold
here, and the University and Sun-Telegraph ticket sales were
not yet in sight of the 300-ducat minimum needed before the trip
can be made. l ,

Of course, there will probably be somesort of a "last-minute
rush” when people discover they can make the trip, want to see
the game, and don’t have the ride to Philly they had counted on.
I But let’s hope the football-minded student body keeps up its
end of the "bargain” that has. raised Pitt’s. football to the high
spot of the past decade. They asked for better football, let’s
hope they support it. '

: Away games, particularly one like the Penn game, which is
‘lose enough to be convenient and potentially a good rivalry,
from which for the first time a Pennsylvania champion maybe can
i determined, offer the best chance for the -students to exhibit
 su _ort. ‘ '

\ THIRD OF A SERIES

Conducting many functions that serve to enrich student life
on this campus is the YMCA, an agency benefiting by the com-
munity chest portion of the Pitt Chest Fund Drive.

The work at~Pitt is guided by a committee of management,
consisting of nine faculty members, nine students elected by “Y”
members, and three alumni or friends of the association. Forming

a student cabinet, the nine man-
agement committee, students join
with four commission heads to con-

. duct functions in four main cate-

gories; Christian Heritage, Social
Responsibility, World Relatedness,
and Personal Growth and Campus
Affairs. I

Under the’ Christian Heritage
group, the “Y” conducts a Bible
studyclass every week on Tuesday
afternoons. A chapel service is
given each Wednesday between 1
and 1:30 p.m. at Heinz Chapel by
Dr. Brittain.

  lnquires

By BETTY MCGUIRE

 

The University’s freshman pro-
gram is well underway with mentor
meetings, mixer dances, customs
exams, and the controversial dinks.
To find out what the students think
of this program, we talked to a few.
These are some typical opinions;

Louise 'ROSS, Education" ’S‘0:
'Dinks and armbands are a very
good idea. The veterans are almost
gone and young people coming in
from high school look forward to
initations and traditions. Orienta-
tion programs foster school spirit
and make college life more enjoy-
able.’

Ronald Cost, Engineering ’51:
‘I think dinks are silly and juve-
nile. Tradition is fine, but why
make a fellow look foolish? Fel-
lows should wear green armbands.
Let the girls wear dinks.’

Elaine Pavlik, College 353: ‘My
mentor has been wonderful and Lan-
tern Night was very impressive.
It’s helped me a lot.’_

Andy Schurman, College ’5l: The
program would be much better if
upperclassmen would cooperate.
They should say, ‘Hi, welcome to
Pitt,’ when they see a freshman
wearing a dinkiinstead of making
fun of him.

Joe Glorioso, College ’53: Cus-
toms exams are good because I
think everyone should know about
the school.

Janet O’Hagan, College '52: Girls
would like dinks better, but our
traditions are tops. .

Dick Brose, College ’53= I learn-
ed more about the school at fresh-
man camp than any place else. That
was what I don’t mind wearing a
dink as long as everybody else doe s.,

Lois Hager, College ’S0: Panhe1-
lenic Reception is the only part of
the program that I didn’t’ like. The
The Reception was nice for soror-

'ity girls, but freshmen didn’t get

to meet too many people. A well
planned formal reception in the
Commons Room would be better. i

iRa‘y Maher, College ’50: This
year's program for men was very
successful because we got the
freshmen while they were at the
peak of enthusiasm. It would be
better if men were allowed to wear
dinks in the building, that is every-
where‘ but the Commons Rooms and
the classrooms.

Katherine Theiss, Education ’51:
Freshmen should get more help at
registration. some of them get.ter-
rible schedules because they don’t
know much about arranging their
programs.

the "Y” brings in speakers for the
program and contributes money and
workers to the overall event. Last
year, a popular part of “Religion
in Life” week was a marriage clinic
conducted by outside speakers.

Working in Personal and Campus
Affairs, the “Y” sponsors amonthlyi
lunch. The Oct. 24 luncheon will
feature “Cy” Hungerford, a well-
known Pittsburgh cartoonist. On
the weekend before registration, a
freshmen camp is conducted at
Camp Kon-O-Kwee. Counselors are
furnished by the “Y”, to instruct
freshmen. In the social vein, the
“Y” holds frequent picnics, parties‘
and dances in conjunction with the
YWCA. I

Various conferences and con-
ferences and conventions are held
with members from other schools at
which subjects like "Christianity
and Communism” are discussed.
The "Y” also organizes athletic
teams to participate in intramural
sports.

Holds Town Meetings
The work in Social Responsibility
includes a Pitt Town Meeting which
is run like an old time town meeting.

the Red Tuck Shop gives interested
students achance to discuss timely
topics. The Pre-med Forum on Fri-
day the fifth hour is planned to
bring medical specialists‘ of all
fields before pre-meds. On High
School Day, which will be con-
tinued as an annual event, a Hi-Y
rally and lunch is ‘given for high
school members. Sent out on request
/to meetings and gatherings like
PTA sessions are deputation teams.
A team last year consisted of three
members, a Jew, a Negro, and a
Catholic. They spoke on “My
experiences in belonging to a min-
ority group.” . ‘

On a larger scale, the “Y” does
work in World Relatedness. The
Student Christian Federation here
is apart of the World Student Christ-
ian Federation, an agency represent-
ing all Protestant faiths and working
on a movement to organize all Pro-
testant faiths and working on a
movement to organize all Protes-
tants into one church.

Aids Foreign Groups

The “Y” contributes to the
World Student Service Fund, an
agency supplying textbooks and
aid to foreign students. It takes
part in the ecumenical movement,
an attempt to unite all faiths into
a single World Church.

According to Don Wilde, presi-
dent of the YMCA at Pitt, the over-
all-purpose of his organization is
"to interest students in activities,
get them thinking in terms of Christ-
ian principles to their daily relation-

Pennsylvania Week has hit the
Western Pennsylvania Historical
Society. '

The Historical Society, located
on Bayard St., is displaying the
celebrated Celeron lead plate.

According to history, Captain
Bienville de Celeron, buried this
lead plate in 1749 as a mark that
 the French were taking possession
“of the territory.

This plaque is one of Western
Pennsylvania's most important.
historical relics because the jour-
nals and map of Celeron and his
compatriots are the earliest existing
records of this area.

A Valued at $100,000, the plaque
has been loaned to the Society by
the American Antiquarian Society
of Massachusetts. The other re-
maining plate is owned by the Smith-
sonian Institute. .

Other items on display are a

Student Congress can t give the
final approval to the NCC, it can
just recommend, Dario Icardi, Men’s
Council representative, stated.

Icardi said, he will not’vote for
the NCC until he has complete in-
formation on these four points:

1. List ofschools where the NCC

is operating.

2. List of all the store contracts.

3. Organizational set-up on the
Pitt campus.

4. Until Scioscia contracts the

administration.

According lo Scioscia, the~Na—
tional Campus Club originated at
Stanford University as an auto-'
mobile club to get discounts for
students on gasoline.

Claims Big Membership
Scioscia claimed that the NCC
included 100 colleges and univer-

sities with a membership of over
one-half million students. _

Scioscia said he was contacted
by Walter Kaplan, five-state dis-
trict manager, to act as the Du-
quesne manager.

The organization sells books of
stamps to students for 33, which
are detached when a purchase is
made from one of the stores listed
on the back cover of the book.

Scioscia said he has contacted
60 stores and all have signed con-
tracts with the NCC.

Frosh Meet
W&J Here

Tomorrow

RV STANLEY SKIRBOLL

Coach Ted Schmitt took his fresh-
man squad up the hill last week to use
the varsity for a ‘warm-up’ for tomor
row’s tilt with the W&] frosh.

Schmitt took one day off from his
usual practice schedule to give the
frosh a chance to play against their
big brothers, even though the session
was a bit more rugged.

Prexies Tested
With a promise to come back again
the frosh returned to their preparations
for the Prexy game tomorrow_at the
Stadium. While tomorrow's game will

be the third for the W&] freshman, it.

will be the initial contest for the Pitt
team. In their two other encounters the
Prexies have an even split, losing to
Kiski prep, 7-0, and defeating the

. California reserves, 20-13.

Schmitt has named a probable start-
ing lineup, depending ‘upon conditions
at the kickoff.’ Although he doesn’t use
any type of platoon system, Schmitt

would like to have certain boys start-‘

ing if Pitt receives.

Waltm Speedy

One ofgthese is Warren (Rabbit) Wal-
ton, speedster from Donora. ‘If we re-
ceive,’ Schmitt said, ‘I like to have
Warren in there, and give him a chance
to get away.’ The Rabbit had been
showing that ability quite well in prac-
tice.

As for the remainder of the squad,
Schmitt and the rest of the coaches are
stressing aerial offense and defense.
The ragged blocking shown in practice
also has worried the head mentor. ‘If we
are to make any kind of a showing, our
blocking will have to improve,’ Schmitt
said. '

Gentille Leads Phi Kaps

To 7-6

Win Over Fijis

‘BY DON MURDOCK

Displaying a4hard charging line and alert defensive work on the part
of the backfield, Phi Kappa struggled to‘ a 7-6 win over Phi. Gamma
Delta at the Schenley Oval on Tuesday.

After 18 minutes of stout defensive work with neither team threaten-

ing, Phi Gam drewvfirst blood.

Bob Homer threw a 40-yard
aerial to Buzzy Pinkerton who
sneaked through the Phi Kap de-
fense and was standing all alone
inithe end zone. The whistle end-
ing the first half blew soon after
with the Fijis leading, 6-0.

Not only did the Fijis blank the
Phi Kaps during the first half, but
only one Phi Kap pass was com-
plete because of the fine perform-
ance of the 3-2-1 Fiji defense.

In the third quarter the Fiji de-
fense was cracked by short flat
passes from the arm of Tippy Gen-
tille. Six straight completed passes
were climaxed by a 10-yard touch-
down throw from Gentille to Jim

, Wall.

The all important extra point
was tacked on by Don Harrington
who stepped over the goal line
from his center position and snared
a pass from Gentille.

The Phi Kap defense took over
where the last year's champs left
off in the third quarter to prevent
anymore scoring.

The Fijis threatened to score
late in the game only to have Gen-
tille, who was outstanding all
afternoon, intercept a pass in the
end zone.

If the Phi Kaps continue playing
as they did on Tuesday, there will
be many long and rough afternoons
in store for future Phi Kap oppon-
ents.

Pi Lams Victors

Pi Lambda Phi gained victory by
the narrow margin of one pass from
center as they squeezed by Sigma
Chi, 8-6. at Schenley Oval this
Week. «

Sigma Chi scored early in the
first period when Jack Hardman
raced eight yards around end for
the T.D. Pi Lams scored in the
second period when a Sigma Chi
pass was intercepted in the end

two points.

YMCA Eagles remained undefeated

Chester Gusicara passed for one
touchdown and scored another as

Jack Nard pitched a 25 yard touch-

THE BK, GAME HUNTER Panthers Expected To Give

Indiana 12th Straight Loss  

By Joan MEGELLA .
By having the football situation well in hand Saturday, Mike M
lvlilligan’s Panthers are expected to play the roles of Hoosier

schoolmasters in giving Indiana
the 1949 season at Bloomington.

Thus far thispyear, Coach Clyde
Smith’s sophomore-ladened Hoosier
squad is running true to its late
1948 form when it dropped seven
straight games. To date, Indiana
has lost to Notre Dame, Ohio State,
Texas Christian, and Iowa.

Can’t Last
A strong first half team Indiana
has managed to score and present
a stout defense during the early

stages of the game against all of

its opponents. But the whistle be-
ginning the second half has been
the signal for a complete Hoosier
offensive and defensive collapse.

With only 17 lettermen returning,
Smith has built a youthful team
around veteran Quarterback Nick
Sebek. The Ibosiers use both the
the single wing and T-formation
offensively. Sebek does the passing
and some of the kicking.

Rounding out the backfield are
Fullback Milan Sellers, and Half-
backs Al Tutsie, ex—Duquesne star,
and Bob Robertson, the Hoosier
offensive running threat. Overall
the Hoosiers claim a balanced team
notwithstanding the fact that seven
of the starting lineup. are sopho-
mores.

Taliaferro Gone
In addition to the lack of ex-
perienced starters and reserves,
Indiana’s losses can, in part, be
attributed to the loss of Halfback

. George Taliaferro. With a year of
. eligibility

remaining, Taliaferro
quit the Hoosiers and signed to
play with the Los Angeles Dons.

Last year he did most of the
running and all of the passing and
punting.

Up front, the Hoosiers boast of
a brother combination in Guard
Walt Bartkiewicz and End Joe Bart-
kiewicz.

In the Pitt-Indiana series, the
Hoosiers are on the long end with
five victories against one loss.

Harriers Engage
Western Reserve ,

Pitt’s cross country team will be
seeking its second victory of the
season Saturday in a dual meet with
Western Reserve at Schenley Park. i
Starting time is 1:30 p.m.

The Panthers displayed fine form
last Saturdav when they captured
the first seven places in a triang-
ular meet with Geneva and West-
minister. Previously the locals
had dropped its opener to Slippery
Rock. ’

 

THE PITT LINE, which had
allowed an average of only 87
yards a game against it in three
previous games, gave up 269 yards
to Miami on Saturday.

Jayvee’s Win
First Game

A (Cont. from Page 5)

Only 3 minutes remained when
Pitt started their final touchdown
drive. A combination of Bill Jones’
passing and Bob Jones’ running led
the winning march of 59 yards. With
only 43 seconds left Bill hit Jack
Carroll with a 13 yard pass on the
two, and he fell into the end zone
for the clincher. 5 D .

No one player was responsible
for the jayvee _win. It was strictly
a team victory. However, Rus Phil-
lips and Gil Bucci were outstanding
on the line and the same can be said
for Bob Fesko and the Jones, boys.

his letter arrived Monday, she hadn’t
even heard from her promised escort.

And, according to Johnson’s letter,
he had never heard of Nancee until
a short time ago.

Nancee’s plight received nation-
wide publicity when. she wrote to
the editors of LIFE magazine com-
plaining of the neglect she had re-
ceived from the radio program, Mr.
Johnson, and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer,
the actor’s studio.

Several" newspapers picked up
the story, from which Johnson claims
he received his first knowledge of
the date.

His letter to Nancee reads:

"I regret that this is the first .

information I have had about this
matter and can assure you that had
I been in New York at the time and
had I been aware of the date, I

A should have been most happy to have

a little earlier to participate in the
rally.

“I’m here to get an education,’
Fox told Ewart, “not to yell at
rallies after the rvictoryis won. The
place to show your school spirit is
at the stadium where the team can
hear you.” A
P “Pitt isn’t judged on its academic
standards by Pittsburghers, but by
its demonstrations at victory cele-
brations,” Ewart retorted.

“The younger students entering
the University-want more than an\
academic education. Education
means more than just book learn-
ing,” he explained. ‘

Fox then asked Ewart if he “ad-
vocated the type of victory demon-
strations Where students destroy
and steal $200 and $300 of prop-
erty.”

“What if they do destroy a couple
of hundred dollars worth of prop-
erty? Hasn’t the school spent much

more than that in attempting to
promote school spirit?” Ewart,
asked. _

“You’re crazy,” Fox shouted
at Ewart. '

After one revision of the original
motion, two amendments, and sev-
eral rewordings, a vote was taken.
The conservatives lost by a six to
three vote. I

Maher was elected to draft the
letter to the board of deans.

 Frosh 
Checked on
Dink Rules

Freshmen at Ellsworth Center
are being kept on their toes, that is
they are keeping their toes off re-
stricted ground.

"Boy’s Town” is going all out
to enforce Men’s Council’s. en-
larged freshmen orientation and
iniation program this year. Mar-
shalls selected from advanced stu-
dents at Ellsworth survey the
Center’s front entrance which is
restricted to freshmen. They also
observe if dinks are being worn.

‘This -is one step ahead of the
Cathedral which has no specific
marshalling system.

The marshalls have thus far en-
countered'only two students not
cooperating in the plan. One stu-
dent, upon his request, has had his
name submitted to the Upperclass
Court now being formed by Men's
Council.

Ellsworth found at the beginning
of the semester that they had a
much better chance for a marshall-
ing system than does the Cathedral,
according to F. E. Lange, assis-
tant to the director of Ellsworth.

There are approximately 400
freshmen at Ellsworth and only
about 300 sophomores. Mr. Lange
believes it is much easier to
watch students there than it would
be for any group to keep tab on the
freshmen scattered among the Ca-
thedral’s thousands.

Kenneth Linamon, College sopho-
more, deserves most of the credit
for the marshalling system, accord-
ing to Mr. Lange. Linamon is one
of the two non-voting delegates
sent to Men’s Council by Ells-
worth’s Student Council.

Europe. Only one thing in his life
has remained constant--his asso-
ciate professorship at the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh.

He is William G. Crouch of Pitt’s
English department. Dr. Crouch has
not only taught at the University

AB, he began teaching at Pitt and
has been here ever since, except
for the few years when he worked
on his doctor's degree and taught
in Europe.

Earlyin 1945 Dean Stanton Craw-
ford called Dr. Crouch to his office
and calmly asked, "How would you
like to go to Europe.?”

Within a few months he was in
England teaching returning GI’s in
an army university called Shriven-
ham. When the University was dis-
banded, he went to Germany and
then Belgium. There he was attach-
ed to the Army Command Schools
and gave lectures and advised GI’s
on educational.curriculums.
