Proposed Program Includes
Examination, Instruction
In Care Of Teeth

By Stan Markey

A 14-point program, proving
the desirability of a student
dental health service, approved
unanimously by SFA, will be
presented to Chancellor John G.
Bowman for ﬁnal consideration some
time this week. . __

The plan includes a dental exami-
nation of each incoming freshman as
a compulsory part of the medical ex-
amination. These examinations would
take place in the rooms of the dental
department of the Falk Clinic ‘and
would be made by a group of SP9‘
cially-selected senior students in the
school of dentistry. ‘

Charts of the results of the exa1ni-
nations would be made, one given to
the student and one to be ﬁled by
the Student Health Service. Students
would be advised to report any un-
desirable dental conditions to his
family or personal dentist, in order
that they may be corrected.

Instruction in rudiments of dental
care and health practices would be
included in the examination, which
would be started with the recent in-
coming freshman of the class of Feb-
ruary, 1941, if possible.

Need for a student dental service
was brought to mind by a motion in
SF-A assembly by Ernest Rose, D38.
Rose was appointed chairman of a
committee to investigate the possibili-
ties of such a project and to present
a workable plan for such an exami-
nation. Included on the committee
were Dr. J. F. McFarland, instructor
in dental pathology; Barbara Thomas,
BA37, and Robert Churchill,'C37.

The fact has long been established
that such examinations would be de-
sirable from the student’s standpoint.
Figures from Dr. I. F. Miller, who
made a limited number of examina-
tions last year, show conditions of
dental health to be appalling in ‘the
average, college freshman.

There is no question of the impor-
tance of dental health as a faculty
in general physical strength. Ini-
proper chewing a.nd badly-decayed
teeth may lead to many digestive-
disorders and system disturbances.
Toothaches disturb the -powers of
concentration and study which are
so vitally important to the student.

The present cursory examination
of the teeth is insuﬂicient. It caniio't
possiblyshow the condition of the
mouth. The students would un-
doubtedly beneﬁt from the proposed
dental service. -.

Dr. J. H. Baracli has ‘offered the
full cooperation of his ‘staff at Falk
Clinic in addition to. the use of the
rooms and the "equipment. Dean H.
E. Friesell of the Dental School and
Dr. W. P. Walker of the Falk Clinic
dental department, have given their
consent to the use of these facilities.
Dr. H. C. Carlson and Dr. A. M.
Jamison, directors of the Student
Health Service, are very much in
favor of the idea in conjunction with
their work.

Barriers to freedom in this country,

‘tion operated according to 19th‘ cen-

2.0t.li_ century problems,” were dis-
cussed by Dr. E. C. Lindeman, soci-
ologist and government adviser, at In-
quiry Forum, Monday. .

The constitutional barrier was one
of .=.e.ven_ reviewed by Dr. Lindeman.
He ein.phasiz.ed the need for a change
in constitutional interpretation, pre-
dicting another collapse, much worse
than the last, about 1940, if condi-
tions are not materially changed.

Stresses Expansion _

Failure of the peopleito recognise
tha't freedom is related to economic
security, Dr. Lindeman presented as
his third point. He stressed the need
for producing more goods, and build-
ing more houses.

“The next point,” he continued, “is
the cumulative loss of personal abil-
ity. There is one safeguard against
bureaucracy, and that is wider parti-
cipation in government by the citi-
zens. '

“In this country, the opposite has
happened. As government has in-
creased, the citizens have withdrawn.”

The sociologist then named the fact
that “we all tend to become special-‘
ists” as another barrier. Freedom, he
explained, must be viewed in rela-
tionship to the whole.

Treats Child Labor Law

Listing also “the persistent falla-
cies associated with the concept of
freedom_.’'' lic deplored the association
by its opponents of the child labor
law with freedom. “Every step in
collectivism,” he said, “ought to be
an increase in freedom, if people had
in mind what being a member of a
group meant.”

“A spurious fallacy,” he called the
last point, “the association of free-
dom with economic planning.” The
basic objectives of a planned society
would be increased production and an
increase in the freedom of the great
masses of workers, he stated.

basketball games: Over in Trees’
Gym, where the women’s physical ed-
ucation majors are staging their own
basketball tournament, the sopho-
mores battled the seniors in as excit-
ing a struggle as has been recently
seen in the Stadium, and beat them
by the margin of 28-27.

This contest between the sophs and
seniors, fought last Thursday, was the
first game of the majors’ tournament,
in which competition is between class-
es. Future games are scheduled to
-be played on‘ Tuesday and Thursday
afternoons from 4 to 6 o’clock until
the end of basketball season.

Tomorrow, the non-major intra-
mural tourney in which any woman
student may participate will get un-
der way with the first game being
slated for 4 ‘o’c‘1ock. Mary Weidle,
C39, basketball manager of WAA, is
in charge of the tournament.

Participants‘ in these tournaments
will have an opportunity to compete
against teams from other Pittsburgh
colleges at the city intercollegiate

Paula: Goes Up . . . E

To say the least, it is gratifying to;
learn thatJohn Paulus, C34, has be-;
come Sports editor of the Washing-g
ton Post. That the name Paulus is‘

‘beyond all’ doubt unfamiliar to the

average Pitt student is" merely an-

other ‘proof‘t_hat"‘fame is a ﬂeeting

thing,” "particularlywhen itfs__ cam-_
pusfame. ' ‘ e _ ‘
Three -years ago, Paulus was edi-
tor of The News during an especially
stormy period in its history. ‘He was
the first recently to ' introduce a
strong editorial policy and to bring
the consideration of natioiial and
civic problems into The News.
Encouraging‘ Symptom‘ . _. .
Paulus began to -write for The
Pittsburgh Press im_me.diately after
‘graduation. He rose to assistant
sports editor, thence to the copy desk,
where he worked until. obtaining his
present position. ’ _,
While on The P1‘ess,"Paulus was ac-
tive‘ in the Newspaper Guild, edited
the “Inner House Organ,” journal-
istic guild paper. ’ v, V
It is encouraging that Paulus is a
Pitt man, and a Pitt News man . . .

even more encouraging thathe has a.

Story . . .

- A fairly amusing story is the one
we heard concerning ‘a Pitt wrestler
the other day. We won’t» mention his
name, but Coach __Ed Mazeski could
probably reveal it if he wanted to . . .

C it

_ It seems that this fl}V’W_elg‘l’1l‘. sopho-
. more was having a streak of espe-

cially tough luck. All through his

, freshman year he had taken a pretty_

severe lacing; in fact, he spent most
of his competitive time with his
shou.‘-.ders pinned to the mat. But he
had the spirit of a lion, and when he
strutted his 118 pounds into the ring,

‘E21239 0 uI?£::: _ he looked like‘ a miniature Tarzan
miliaiqity with the  .. .. _  whose strengtli and ability A were
"board track, and Johnny W,oodmﬁ boundless." Yet he kept on losing.

He made ‘the varsity his sophomore,

year with very little trouble, but im- ,
mediately encountered a long losing:

streak. It was evident, however, that
each time he was thrown he ‘had
learned a little bit more about wres-
tling. Then came "the W&J match.

An independent survey was made -recently
among professional men and women -—‘law'yers,
€l0Ct01'S, lecturers, scientists, etc. Of those who said

’ they smoke cigarettes, .more' than 87

_o'pponent’s armpit and around his

“Grunt And Groan . . .”
The boyhad been looking good in
practice, and he strutted into the ring

with a world of conﬁdence. He im-
mediatclygot the upper hand over
the W &J ilyweight, and soonsecureds
the death-dealing,"bone-crushing hold
known as the “;Okl‘ahoma,R;ide-.-” _,I-Iis

neck in a strangulating half-Nelson.

Of ‘course., there have been other

most recent ‘is that of the boxer in

and shot headlong past him": to knock
himself out on a ring post.

the world when Biggie Goldbergfum-i

25-yard line in the Rose Bowlggame.
Yet it led directly to the" second and
game-clinching touchdown, . although
putting the Panthers in a*to,ugh spot
at first glance. And wlleii’-Joe Gar-
cia actually sank that foul in the last‘
30 seconds of-the. extra period in they
Duquesne game last week, it looked
like the_ worst possible play, giving
the ball, as it did, to the Dukes who
still-' held -.‘a one-point lead. Yet it
made Peppy the game’s‘l1ero.. It must
have been Ambrose J , Weems, or per-
haps his daughter Ambrosia who

epitomized the whole situation when
he (or she) said: “One man’s error.

Cap and Gown circles, Mr. Carl‘ ‘_°Casey at the
' ' While we regret leafrning that Mr.
Viehman has left th_e Cap and Clown party, 
are conﬁdent that the Kelly-Class duo shall prove
a ye_ry_ worthy successor to that gentleman. Mr.
Cass,‘ who hasbeen doing a bit of. immortalizing
of “-Casey at the Bat” among the ranks of every
freshman class for quite some time now, leaving
an‘ impression that lasts even longer than the
regular four-year session here, has the conﬁ-

, dence and good will of every man in this Uni-

versity. fThose who have worked with him in
Pitt Players know him not only as a ﬁne direc-
tor, but also a great guy. It is he who has de-
veloped play production to its present high level.
He has worked under the mostdifficult handi-
caps, striving to develop acting talent here. He
has asked for no credit, has received little more,
and deserves more than any of us will ever be
able to accord him. Perhaps upon the comple-
tion of the Foster Memorial, he shall be re-
warded by being provided with the facilities to
carry his program to new heights, and thus per-
haps more people will then appreciate the scope
of this man’s activities.

Good luck ‘to you, Carl Cass. We wish you
success in your new venture;

and the polite COll\'(!1‘.SallOl’léll_lSt Lunib v.'ei'e not the only
critics who set st_anda.1’ds for app1‘eciat.ion, but they
must. be included in the lists. ‘

ls it not just a little strange that we all have
identical or near-identical estirnates of literature?
ls it not possible that we have been regimented into
troops of.“yes-men,” with the inevitable result being
the deterioration of the critical eye? And yet you
who agree precisely with the critical estimates of the
‘past will argue that it is your personal, not pro-
" scribed, agreement.

The history _of the criticism of culture would Prove

interesting. -How have we arrived at our a.ln1o>:~t. ‘uni-'

ver’s:il respect. for S}.1a.kespeare and Sponsor, Mi-lton and
Chaucer as the four greatest. poets of Englisli litcra—1.ui*o.?
Why do we agree, critically. that William l\/Iakepe-ace
Thackeray's “Hein'y Esinond”  the best, or at least

among the ten best ‘novels of English w1-it.ing- authors?

Why has the American reading public rushed to
file book stores and the libraries to obtain copies of
Mrs. Mitchell's “Gone With the Wind”? ‘Why was
"Anthony Adverse" hailed by the millions and "Loolg
Homeward, Angel” by the thousands? _

Often, as We l'la‘.'G tiuisherl mzidiiig the orthodox 310
pages of a 'CF.'.l£‘.l)l‘{ll}E‘.(l tragedy or c.‘-oinecly or tragi-
conie-dy, we wonder why it slioI.ild be CF.‘.:l€l?l‘8.l§9.Cl. If it

--“how~phi‘losophical; how a.nal_vl.ic;il!"—

"According To . . ."

Chances are we would present our estimate in strict
accord with our predispositions: fjroin ‘thou-.riticism
we have culled fro.-nlfboolc review sections, from astute
remarks by responsible readers, from tabulations that
accurately reveal what volumes the depai-ti-neat stores
are wrapping up and sending to most homes.

. Perhaps we cl-on’-t'*‘wisl1'to*leavc our bool<"pui'c-liases
to random collected opinions: and so we add our nann-
to one of the"publlshei_'s_’ houses that mails us. every 1'oI.ir
weeks, THE proscribed volume of the 111-Olltll.

At any rate, we have lost the facility for acute‘
' literary taste and have taken charge accounts with
cultural drug stores who ﬁll for us the prescriptions
‘of our critical doctor. =‘We have lost the one medicine
that could sharpen the" dulled surface of lash: buds:
naivete. “‘ ‘l "‘ ’:"
