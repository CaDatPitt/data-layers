New Restrictions Add
To Driving Problems

Student, Faculty Car-Owners Face

4 Possible Loss of All Parking Places

CaI'-Cl1‘iVlDg'.UﬂlVeI'Sll3,V-SlI11(lQlltS,,E1l,1Cl faculty members were ap-
prehensive this week as parking restrictions continued to ensnare

them on all sides of Frick Acres.

Be inning last \Vednesdav with what authorities termed “en-
g r: - . . .  .
forcement” of a two-hour parking limit on the llllitll Avenue side

of the Cathedral, restrictions
have now taken on additional
threats of no parking in the
Schenley Park plaza after April
16 and along Tennyson a.nd Rus-
kin avenues and apart of Lytton
avenue.

The plaza will be lost to stu-
dent and faculty use after the
opening of baseball season. The
other area is expected to become
restricted in the very near fu-
ture as a result ofia drive sup-
posedly initiated by residents on
the neighboring streets.

Thus the hundreds of University
drivers must prepare to choose
one of the following alternatives:

1. Fight it out for space on
Bigelow and Belleiield between
Fifth and Forbes—-an area which
observers estimate will hold some
fifty to seventy-ﬁve cars.

2. Park some distance
from the Cathedral.

3. Leave their cars at home.

As an effort to voi-ce University
protest against the limitations, an
SFA committee under the super-
vision of Dave Buente, C41, is this
week’ meeting ‘with Dean of Men
Vincent W. Lanfear. Buente is

away

 

chairman of the SFA traffic and
safety committee. ‘

Buente’s original ‘course of ac-
tion was introduced at last week's
SFA meeting and although not
meeting the disapproval of the as-
sembly it was shelved to a special
committee to iron out rough spots.

Keynote of his proposal .was “Off
the street parking is the only solu-
tion.” This he attempted to do
by either or both of two things:

1..A long range program of
building underground parking
levels beneath the Cathedral
similar to a plan in operation at
the University of Kansas.

2. An immediate remedy in the
leasing of Ruskin Field by the
SFA and the University for use
by student and faculty parkers.

While ﬁnancial and geographic
complications were admittedly in-
herent in the underground plan,
the main stumbling block in the
Ruskin Field development appears
to -be the unsettled ownership of
the property. Supposedly admin-
istered by the F. F. Nicola Realty
company, Ruskin Field, Buente
said, is the object of a court in-
vestigation now in: progress.

Warnings Financed by PAA

When the two-hour enforcement
drive began on Fifth and Lytton
avenues last week, it was at first
generally believed that the move
was sponsored by the Better Traf-
fic Committe as an attempt to
facilitate traffic conditions in the
Oakland district.

Later developments, however, in-
dicate that the enforcement came
as a result of a pressure group
headed by the Pittsburgh Athletic
Association, whose building faces
the Fifth avenue entrance to the
Cathedral.

Evidence pointing to this con-
clusion is seen in the reports that
PAA ﬁnanced the printing of red
warning stickers placed on Fifth
avenue parkers on March 14 four
days before the enforcement went

into effect and that the PAA  pay-
ing the salary of the police officer
now patrolling the Fifth avenue
and Lytton avenue beat.

Further investigation by the Pitt
News shows that the PAA an-
nounced through a circular sent to
its members that the ordinance
prohibiting parking on Lytton was
passed by City Council “at the sug-
gestion of the House Committee
(PAA) and adjacent property own-
ers.”

The enforcement of the two-hour
parking on Fifth Avenue is only
temporary, according to Buente. It
is supposed to be placed into ef-
fect for a sixty day period at the
end of which City Council will.
decide whether or not to make it
permanent.

Residents Refuseto Name Sponsor

The proposed restritcions along
Tehnyson, Ruskin, and the other
part of Lytton is the subject of a
petition now being circulated
among residents of these streets, it
was learned by the Pitt News.
When this petition receives 500
names, not necessarily residents of
these streets, it will be present-
ed to the Better Traﬁic Committee
for recommendation to City Coun-
cil for permanent restriction.

Don lVIcNeal, city trafﬁc engineer,
is reported to have said that al-
though the sympathy of the Bet-

Two-Feature Program

In a double feature program, the

1:30 o’clock in 24 Cathelral, an-
nounces Dave Tucker, C41, chair-
man of SFA theater committee.

“The Other Side of Town” deals
with the inside story of slum clear-
ance, its problems, beneﬁts, and
progress. Presented under the

were to be added to the petition,

be placed into effect.

Exactly what limitations would
be made along Tennyson, Ruskin,

No Beer, No Fooling . . .

Kathedral Kitchenette Finally Opens

No hats——

10 cent sodas-— _

Kathedral Kitchenette!

Opening only ten minutes later
than scheduled, the new University
cafeteria enjoyed an unexpected
rush of business, despite attempts
to instill an atmosphere of dignity,
when the doors were opened at pre-
cisely 2:10 o’clock Monday after-
noon.

Two hundred sodas Were sold
within the ﬁrst 20 minutes.

First female student to enter the
“kitchenette” was Mary lvlarkle,
F.d40, who also made the first pur-
chase-—a chocolate sundae.

Joe McCormick, BA40, the ﬁrst
male mustomer, managed to com-
municate, between gulps of his coke,
that everything was “wunnerful!”

The ﬁrst soda was purchased by
a student for Mrs. Lindsay, of the
registrar’s oﬁce.

to an appearance and a rapid disap-
pearance by John G. Weber, secre-
tary and business manager of the
University. “It looks pretty good,”
he mumbled just before his de-
parture.

Albert Klimcheck, University
acchitect, refused to be quoted.

Student observations indicated a
favorable attitude. Robert Dalzell,
C41, rhymed his opinion--—-“sodas
are fine, lots for a dime.”

Shirley Marcus, C43, devouring a
dish of fruit salad, came to the con-
clusion that the fresh pineapple was
delicious.

The new cafeteria will be open
from 8 o’clock in the morning until
8 o’clock in the evening, according
to Mrs. Alice Wiilker, manager.

Throughout the entire procedure,

Dr. H ovde Discusses Evolution
Of Housing Program at Forum

Origin and evolution of a housing
program was the theme of a dis-
cussion ‘ on f‘Slum Clearance’ and
Low Cost Housing in Pittsburgh,”
by Dr. B. J. Hovde, former asso-
ciate professor of history and ad-
ministrator of the Pittsburgh Hous-
ing authority, and
1William C. Hill,
,director of the
Bedford dwellings,
at Monday’s In-
quiry Forum.

Describing the
Pittsburgh housing
projects as “char-
acterized by free-
dom from political
patronage, a con-
tract basis of con-
struction, and a
cheap land-cost
program,” the
housing authorities
explained the planning and con-
struction of the Hill district slum-
clearance apartments which were
recently opened for tenancy.

Subsidized by the United States
HA, the PHA has to date spent
$17,000,000 for the ' construction
(planned) of 3073 dwelling units, to
replace a fraction of the 64,000 sub-
standard houses in the Pittsburgh
district. The Hill district, “one of
the best known slum areas in the
world!” was chosen as the first

 

Dr. Hovde

project, since it was the cheapest
land-cost district in the city. The
PHA has saved millions of. dollars
since it could buy and grade land
for seventy cents per square foot.
New York prices range up to $5.
Mr. Hill, an authority on negro
problems as well as housing and
slum clearance, explained the oper-
ation of the Bedford dwellings, the
first PHA project nearing comple-
tion. Rents range from $18 to $23
per month, while occupancy is re-
stricted to low income groups.

Following the two main speakers
aniopen forum was held. Dr. John
Oliver, professor and head of ‘the
department of history, was intro-
ductory speaker, announcing the
publication of Dr. Hovde’s new book,
“The History of Scandinavia up to
1850.”

“The Other Side of Town,” pro-
duced by the United States Housing
Authority, and revealing living con-
ditions in slum areas in the South,
together with a ﬁlming of slum re-
habilitation, will be shown at the
Essefay Theater, 24 Cathedral,
Thursday from 12:30 until 5:30
o’clock.

A reel “of pictures made of the
Bedford dwellings during construc-
tion will be shown also, David
Tucker, C41, chairman of the SFA
theater committee, indicated.

dent .of SFA, presented to the_a.s—
sembly a plan which would again
place the electionof SFA oﬁicers
within the executive committee.

This plan was originally written
into the constitution, but was
changed in 1935 to allow election of
officers by the entire assembly.

Hoeveler believes that by revert-
ing to the original. plan, party poli-
tics will be eliminated and the of-
ficers of SFA will be selected for
their merit rather than for their po-

 

litical ' affiliations. , ,

Before this “amendment can be
:f,ormally‘add.ed to the constitution’s
by-laws, the assembly decided that
a thorough investigation was ne-
cessary. The proposal was referred
to .a committee, headed by Hoeveler.

Results of the internal elections
of Men’s Council show the re-
election ofthree members. leaving
12 members to be elected in the
general student elections on April
19 in Memorial Hall.

Alvin Ludwig, BA4-1; Donald
Parke, C41; and'Harold Byer, C42,
were elected.

Two representatives will thus be
elected from the School of Business
Administration, three from the Col-
lege; three from the School of En-
gineering and one each from the
Schools of Mines and Education.

Fifteen representatives from the
various schools are proportioned as
to the number of students enrolled
in the respective schools.

Fort Monroe. Aiiti-Aioiricraft Unit  
Conducts Local Demonstrations

An anti—aircraft‘battery arrived
at Logan Armory Sunday from Fort
Monroe, Virginia, to demonstrate
the ‘newest types of anti-aircraft
equipment. First Lieut. Wallaston,
C. A. C., is in command of the unit
and will conduct demonstrations
this week. _

On Monday a Searchlight demon-
stration was given to students in the
ROTC. A full battery demonstra-
tion was presented before a Reserve
Officers group last night.

Pittsburgh will get its ﬁrst View
of the new M4 Director, reputed to
be one of the best in theiworld.
This new director synchronizes the
several "guns and searchlight of the
battery. The ﬁre control system for
this new equipment is rated as

deﬁnitely superior by military au-
thorities. /

A sound locater, used to “hear”
planes for night defense. a 800,000,-

the plane, and several anti-aircraft
machine guns, will supplement the
main weapon, a new 1939 model 3
inch. anti-(aircraft gun.

Also in the demonstration is a
new 37 millimeter

gun. This gun follows the recent
foreign trend of light rapid bar-

Extension Actwtttcs

C. ‘Stanton Belfour, assistant di-
rector of the University Extension
Division, is the author of a review
of University extension activities,
the ﬁrst installment of which ap-
pears in the current issue of the
National University Extension As-
sociation bulletin. .

Mr. Belfour maintains that ex-
tension classes, by which teachers,
nurses, social workers, and other
adults are able to receive credit for
work done away from the campus,
do not constitute an opportunist de-
vice noreven a practical plan to
meet a particular necessity. “The

in it C my-em Bulletin

university extension movement is
the gradual evolution of the ' full
conception of what a university is,”
he writes.

The author also explains that the
university extension is the third of
three revolutions in human society;
the Reformation, by which the
whole body of the people was lifted
to interest in religious thinking; the
political revolutions, by which the
whole people came gradually to
share in government; and the ex-
tension movement in education, by
which the whole body of the peo-
ple were able toenjoy a more com-
plete education.

Committee and adjacent property
owners, the City Council has pass-
ed an. ordinance limiting parking.
on Lytton avenue between Fifth

two hours between the hours of
9:30 a. m. to 4:30 p. m. daily, ex-
cept Sunday.

“A similar ordinance covering
Fifth avenue in front of the Club

ber of years, but as you know, has
not been enforced.

“Students come early and stay

late, monopollzing all the parking

I-‘anther, and Mr. Brotzman, our lo-
cal weather forecaster.

My colleagues were the eminent

Accuses Carlson

Dr. Carlson had a ﬂimsy reason
for his verdict. He declared it was
“spring by a car wash.”. meaning
that the owner of a motor car
could have same cleansed without
the danger of encountering more
snow and slush. I claim that Dr.
Carlson is not competent to present
testimony of this kind. I have rid-
den with him winter and summer.
and his car has never been washed
in either season. To Dr, Carlson,
despite his ﬁne words, spring does
not mean La car wash; it means only
the possible arrival of a heavy rain
that will ‘partially, clean his car if
he, cares to leave it out.

Dean Tippetts declared: “It is
