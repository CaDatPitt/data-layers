Silence Period Extends To Next
Wednesday Afternoon; Biddle
Stresses Its Importance

a—j

By Charles B. Holstein

Second semester rushing for men's
social fraternities ofﬁcially comes to
an end at 2 o’clock Sunday morning.
\Vomen's rushing, which began yes-,
terday morning and extends until mid-;
night tomorrow, will probably prove,
to be an unfortunate factor for the
men. Dances and parties scheduled
b_v the men for tonight or tomorrow
night will be hampered greatly by the
difﬁculties of securing “dates” for
rushees and fraters alike. This is the
second consecutive _vear that men's
and women's rushing have conflicted.
Last year the women arranged their
affairs to allow time for attendance

,The damage is estimated at

at events sponsored by the men,

Beginning at the 2 o’clock deadline
and extending until 5 o’clock \Vednes-
day evening, silence period will be in
force. While it lasts all new freshmen
who have been rushed by Greek let-
ter organizations may not engage in
conversation with any fraternity man
who has rushed him, Theodore VV. Bid-
die, assistant to the dean of men,
has stressed the importance of rushees _
and rushers observing the rules of
silence period, and has advised that
all rushees should consider as dis-
honorable any fraternity which
violates the silence custom.

Silence period is maintained each
semester at the close of rushing to‘
afford rushees an opportunity of de-
ciding upon their choice of frater-
nities without the distracting in-
ﬂuences of interested fraternity men.

All bids must be submitted to the
ofﬁce of the dean of men before 9:30
o’clock Monday morning. Throughout
Monday and as long thereafter as is
necessary, the staff of the dean of
men’s ofﬁce will interview biddees as
to their ﬁnal choices. Acceptances and
declinations will not be announced to
the fraternities until Wednesday eve-
ning, at which time pledging will take
place.

Rushing this semester has thus far
been marked by an easygoing atti-
tude all around, decidedly different
from the hectic, frenzied conditions
surrounding the ﬁrst semester sea-
son. Few men are being rushed by
the majority of houses, as the num-
ber of new men in the undergraduate
schools of the university this semester
is about seventy. Second semester
freshman and upperclassmen, who
have not afﬁliated with fraternities
comprise the larger portion of rushees.

Pitt Professors
Make Discovery.

Oartel And Wolf Succeed In
Killing Tooth Infection

Dr. J. S. Oartel, professor in the
dental school, and Dr. E_ Alfred Wolf,
a professor of zoology, have succeeded
in killing germs of tooth infection
with high-frequency radio waves. The
ﬁnal success of the experiment was
announced on Monday in Vvashington
by the American Association for the
Advancement of Science.

It is hoped that this new technique
may eventually be developed suffici-
ently to minimize the danger of in-
fection in extraction of abscessed
teeth.

Researches so far have been on in-
fected teeth treated after extraction.
It is hoped, however, to develop the
technique to such a stage that in-
fection can be killed before extrac-
tion_

In their report to the Association
for the Advancement of Science, the
two professors stated that in 105 in-
fected tooth roots which they treated
with 3.2 meter radio waves, the bac-
teria were destroyed in 28.6 per cent,
of the cases. In 41.9 per cent of the
cases the growth was retarded, their
size decreased, or their formation
broken up.

The germs mentioned are diplos-.
treptococci. The teeth treated were
exposed to waves for periods varying
from five to sixty minutes.

Last Wednesday’s speaker, Rabbi B.
B. Glazer, of the Rodef Shalom tem-

blame for the inertia of present peace
movements on our educational sys-
tems, which according to him, “do
not develop a critical attitude on the
part of their products, toward the
problems of modern life.

“All this talk of militarists about
the logic of their arguments being
water-proof is wrong; for if all
the facts were presented, students
would see the inanity of any war with
its inevitable slaughter and degrada-
tion.”

“The Torch Bearers” Selected As
Final Dramatic Production

George Kelly’s well known satiric
comedy of amateur thespians, “The
Torch Bearers,” will be the ﬁnal play
presented this season by the Pitt
Players. The date for the produc-
tion has been set tentatively for
Thursday, April 5. Although no ar-
rangements have been completed for
an auditorium, the play will definitely
not be presented on the portable
stage of the Schenley hotel as in the
case of the previous performances of
“The Queen's Husband” and “Chil-

Carl B. Cass, director of Pitt Play-
ers, has set next week for try-out
week. All regular members of the
Players and freshman members who
have already ﬁnished their prelimin-
ary try-outs are invited to be present.
The exact time and place of try-outs,
along with the list of Players especial-
ly recommended to attend, will be
posted today on the bulletin board in
the front entrance of Alumni hall.

Twelve one-act plays to be produced
by the Play Production class will also
be cast at the try-out next week. The

News Man, Covering Engineers’
Conclave, Declares He Was
Taken Up And Out

By Paul J. Betz

Before I was tossed none too light-5
ly out the door of Room 817, Ca-
thedral, last Tuesday, along with a bit
of confetti that had been my notes,
I found myself in the middle of a
first rate scrap.

Engineers seem to be of two types,
hose who know what it’s all about
,and those who are still wondering.
{The wonderers believe themselves
imembers of a downtrodden race, sad-
lly suppressed; they bemoan the fact
in no uncertain terms. “Why aren't
the engineers better represented on
the council?”

For ﬁve minutes I listened to this
and then Ray McCune, "34, informed
them that they already had two men
in council. “What good are they do-
ing us?” Evidently cooperation is the
engineers’ keynote and since they
work together in such affectionate
terms, they will doubtless rule the
camp-us by the end of the month. As
far as I could tell that is what they
intend to do.

They passed concrete legislation
when the motion for bigger and bet-
ter dances was made. Bernie Cum-
min"s orchestra was selected for their
next dance and they all agreed, for
the first time since order was re-
quested and not obtained, that his
orchestra would at 168-St Put them 011
the social map.

That problem solved, they turned
their well-scratched heads toward re-
organization. H. C, Pavian, instructor
in aeronautical engineering, had just
begun an autobiography of college,
days, mixed with a few well-aimed]
shots at the alumni, when my serawl-‘
ing was interrupted by a very large
hand that crumpled my collar dis-
gracefully, tore my notes and in the
same movement, landed me on the
wrong side of a loudly slamming door.
The rest of the procedure took place
in Star Chamber session.

routine business about the Engineers’
association, to put forward our idea
of to whom the representatives from
the School of Engineering on the
p-resent Student council should be re-
sponsible.

“We believe they should be respon-
sible to the Engineers’ cabinet. It is
through this cabinet, composed of a.
junior and a senior from each of the
six departments of the School of Engi-
neering, that every engineer is certain
of impartial representation in the af-
fairs of the Engineers’ association.”

“We don't believe,” continued the
engineer, "as a matter of fact it is
quite obvious, that the engineers have
little or no representation on Pitt’s
governing bodies. We believe that by
making our Student council repre-
sentatives directly responsible to the
,Engineers‘ cabinet that a much fairer

representation will be achieved.”

When asked about a possible tie-
up with the School of Mines, Steele
answered: “Such an action was con-
sidered at the meeting, although no
member of the School of Mines has
been approached regarding the mat-
ter. At a. cabinet meeting today the
possibility of this union will be thor-
oughly discussed.

“With the School of Mines cooper-
ating with us we would have four
members of Student council directly
responsible to our cabinet. We be-
lieve that in this way we can secure
a fairer deal on Student council,” con-
.cluded Steele,

Effluvia

By Saul Weisberg

Israel Goldberg. . . .

NRA code administrators and authorities are scheduled to come ‘

together about ten days from now at VVashington. The meeting is
being ballyhooed as the most important conclavc that \Vasl1ington
will have seen in many months. At it, all those with grievances are
to receive a hearing, the defects and good points of the NRA are to
be weiglied, and ﬁnally, suggestions for changes are to be given and,
it is hoped, to get appropriate study.

General Johnson has been moving around the country
city after city, delivering speech after#
speech, the chief purpose of which
seems to be to give General Johnson
the Opportunity to take umbrage at
various nasty remarks that have been
made against the NRLA. He evidently
has met with so many nasty remarks
hat his chief pastime has become
simply the rather questionable habit
of taking umbrage. As a matter of
fact, General Johnson has become an
inveterate umbrage taker, as Ring
Lardner would have put it, sometimes
taking more than is good for him.

Recently, however, General John-
son had the grace to admit that the
NRA is not even nearly perfect, He
pointed out that no system thrown
together in so short a time could
fail to have weak points. The pur-
pose of a grand assembly such as is
to be staged is to ﬁnd the weak points
and remedy these, said General John-
SO11.

I am glad to see that the doughty
general is awake to the needs of the
NRA. I am not so sure that he knows
exactly what is Wrong with it. Per-
haps he does. It is true that as long
as the NRA moves forward with an
eye to the effect it has on various
powerful groups in the country, it
will meet with many difficulties. For
the NRA, as long as it attempts to
raise wages and shorten hours, or in
other words, as long as it raises pro-
duction costs, will find stern opposi-
tion in the ranks of the small busi-
ness man. This has already been
proved in the demands of Senator
Borah and Senator Nye, that the NRA
be investigated and perhaps later rec-
tlﬁed. The NRA, in the same way,
is in the spot of having to be very
careful of the feelings of the big in-
dustrialists, who are willing to raise
production costs, but who are chary,
of granting favors to labor.

Many codes of the NRA have not
been satisfactory. The laundry, hotel,
and restaurant codes are typical ex-
amples. In these codes hours ran
up to 54 hours a week and wages
_‘were as low as 14 cents an hour. Nat-
urally enough, labor has not been
pleased. And the general effects of
such codes have been sad,

Finally, the consumer has been
pretty generally ignored. There is 3.
Consumers’ Advisory board in VVash-
iugton, made up mainly of persons of
wealth and position, and the board has
been lamentably lacking in punch
thus far.

The NRA was brought into existence
by liberals who believe and still be-
lieve that their liberalism will take
the United States out of the depres-
sion. This liberalism has called for
cooperation between all groups and
classes in the United States and is
based on the idea that such coopera-
tion is possible. The idea is. a little
phanta-smagorical. Cooperation be-
tween groups who are struggling for
economic advantages is just about im-
possible, and certainly it is not likely.
At present the aspect of cooperation
is presented, perhaps, but the fact of
conflict is here. President Roosevelt
is attempting to be neutral in a situa-
tion which requires, as do all eco-
nomic situations, an active partisan-
Ship, 11’ President Roosevelt does not
soon come out deﬁnitely in favor of
labor and consumer, the danger is,
that the wealthy classes will assume:
power and control. Even now, the.
code authorities are chieﬂy represen-,.
tative of the industrialist and capital-
ist. The consumer and laborer must
organize and work together in an ef-
fort to control the government and to
exert pressure on authority so that
their demands will receive attention.
Otherwise. the NRA. despite the liber-
alism of the men who created it, will
be nothing more than a means by
v;lz.lcli the great wealth holding groups
can consolidate the power they secret-
ly possess today.

A survey of study methods at New

At Marquette, a student in logic

ran out of material after he had

written only three pages. So he wrote:

“I do not think that you will read
this far and just to prove it I’ll tell
you about the football game which I
saw yesterday.” He was never called
to account for his ﬁve-page story of

the game.

because those are underdeveloped

Pitt Has First

Dual Meet Away‘

 

Trackmen Stand Good Chance
Against West Virginians

Coach Carl Olson's trackmen face
one of the toughest assignments of
their indoor season when they journey
to Morgantown tomorrow to meet the
‘West Virginia trackers in a dual meet.
The freshman events for the affair
have been cancelled at the request of
the Mountaineer coach, Stan Smith.

Pitt’s chances appear relatively
good, judging from the ﬁne perform-
ances the boys turned in down at the
\Vest Virginia relays recently_ Par-
ticularly, the Panthers are conﬁdent
of capturing the 2/5 mile and 4/5
mile relays. Olson is planning to en-
ter Kiger, MacDonald, McMunn. and
Schlossberg in the former and Kiger,
MacDonald, McMunn and Groat in the
latter race.

The 70-yard dash and the 70-yard
high and low hurdles will have Flem-
ing, McMunn, Good and Sowiski as
the bets for the Panthers. Pelucha,
Bonavila, Scott, and Good are being
counted on to capture the honors in
the pole-vault, weight events, broad
jump and high jump.

west Virginia fans will likely watch
with interest the performances of
Bonavita who two weeks ago set a
new Field House record in the 35-
pound weight throw. Bonavita will
also be competing in the 16~p0und
shot put tomorrow. '

\Vagenhouser is expected to take
the mile run in rather handy fashion.
following his last week’s great work
in the Pitt indoor carnival, Bill
Keller has been primed for the mid-
dle distance and will be out to get
a good start toward a record of per-
formances similar to the scintillating
ones he turned in last season.

While the Panthers seem fairly cer-
tain to capture a good number of
firsts, there is every possibility that
the Mountaineers will make it a close
meet by taking many of the second
and third places, which count quite
heavily in the total scores.

The meet will assume added inter-
est due to the strong feeling of rivalry
which has cropped up between the

Pitt and Mountaineer track teams of.

late. The ‘Vest Virginians take their
track _e_y_ery bit as seriously as do
Olson and his proteges which means
that ﬁreworks may be expected to pop
at any moment.

Jack Denny Wins
Senior AMA 220

Jack Denny won ﬁrst place in the
Senior A)-IA 220—yard freestyle race
in a meet sponsored by the Home-
stead Library club on Thursday night.
Russell Lindberg finished only one-
tenth of a second behind Denny in a
very fast race.

Denny's time for the 220 was 2.24:2
and Lindberg’-s was 2.24:3, which in-
dicates the closeness of the race. Pete
Brueckel of the PAA won third place
in the senior event with a time of
2.26:3. Jack Hanna, Panther 440 man
ﬁnished in fourth place. His time
was 2.28.

In the Junior AMA 220-yard race
Joe Jones was the only Pitt swimmer
to place. Gates of the Boys club won
first place in the fast time of 2.26:4.

 

Jones ﬁnished second with a time of

2.33:1, and Segady of the Duquesne
library was third. His time being
2.35:2.

I Golden Cats Play

Hoyas At Capitol

Carlsonmen Seek Fifth Win In
Eastern Conference

 

Now that the Pitt home basketball
season has come to a conclusion (and
what a conclusion) the Panthers are
set for a list of games on foreign
ﬂoors. In their ﬁrst game in the east
this year the Panthers will oppose the
Georgetown Hoyas in an Eastern In-
tercollegiate Conference game.

The Hoyas extended the Panthers
in the opening game of the local sea-

31. Since that time Pitt has come
along fast and the string of Panther
successes includes four victories in
the conference standings. Pitt leads

the league with that many wins in as
many starts,

Georgetown has been having an in
and out season, their record in the
conference being four victories and
four defeats. The Hoyas have as
their best point-getter forward Har-
gaden. Pitt followers will remember
this sharpshooting ﬁoorman for his
work against the Panthers in the
opener Hargaden gathered in 12
points for his work that night to tie
the scoring honors with Ochsen-

A\Il
hirt.

Pitt will be ﬁghting over—conﬁdence,
for the most part, and the Hoyas are
clever enough basketball players to
take every advantage of such a situ-
ation. A victory over Pitt would
atone for whatever hard lines have
been the lot of the Georgetowners this
season.

Carlson is expected to start his reg-
iular ﬁve in the event that Charley
;Hughes has completely recovered
ifrom his illness, Just how much
}action the regulars will see depends,
of course, on how the Hoyas look to-
morrow night. The second ﬁve of
Roderick, VVainio, Noon, Kuno, and
Nickel will make the trip and will
likely be inserted into the game early.

Should Charley Hughes not be able
to play, Carlson will fall back upon
the lineup which sends Don I\ilcCamant
‘to a guard position with Ochsenhirt
and brings either Roderick or Wainio
into the game to team up with Skip
Hughes at the forwards. Cribbs will
remain at center.

Charles ‘Chalmers,
Champ And Olympic Star,
Swims For Visitors

 

The Varsity swimming team will
meet Franklin and Marshal tomorrow
,night at 8 o’clock in the Keystone
§Athletic club pool. They will afford

{the Panthers their ﬁnal collegiatej

opposition of the year. Should the
Pitt team win it will have a strong
hold on ﬁrst place in the Eastern In-

In their other two league meets Coach
Pat Corr's team has defeated the
{University of Delaware and Carnegie
Tech.

Franklin and Marshall's swimming
team will more than likely give the
Panthers much more competition

the visitors have long been 3. strong
contender in Eastern swimming cir-
cles.

On the F‘&M team is one of the
country’s outstanding swimmers,
Charles Chalmers, He holds the na-
tional collegiate backstroke champion-
ship, and was also a member of the
American Olympic Swimming team.
Besides swimming the backstroke
event, Chalmers swims in several free-
style events.

Russell Lindberg, Pitt’s entry in the‘

backstroke race has some respect for
the chan1pion’s ability as a back-
stroker, but not enough to think that
he cannot beat him in the 150-yard
backstroke race. The winner of the
race whether it is Lindberg or Chalm-
ers, you may be assured that a new
district, if not national record will be
established,

Coach Corr, satisﬁed with the re-
sults gained in the past meets in-
tends to start the same, or approxi-
mately the same lineups that downed
Ohio State, Carnegie Tech, and Dela-
ware.

Herman Adlersberg, who has taken
ﬁrst places in all of the 50-yard races
in which he has competed, and Paul
Stinner, who has yet to be beaten by
an opponent will swim the 50-yard
sprint.

Jack Denny and either Joseph Mad-
den or Charles Ruhe will swim the
100-yard race. Denny will also swim
the 220 along with William Lewis, the

other Pitt entry. Jack Hanna and’

William Swazuk are scheduled to
swim the 440-yard race.

Joseph Schmeiler and Herman Ad-
lersberg will handle the breaststrok-
ing duties. Joe Jones will team up
with Lindberg in the backstroke race
against Chalmers. The relay team
will probably be composed of Charles
Chambers, Charles Ruhe, Paul Stin-
ner, and Jack Hanna.

But why send 4,000
miles for tobacco?

Panthers Rally In Second Half
To Defeat Westminster
In District Classic

 

Vv'estminster’s Titans were Titans
for just twenty minutes of their little
ball game with Pitt’s Panthers Wed-

nesday night, After that the New
Wilmington lads appeared to lose
their titanic qualities before an on-
slaught of Pitt ﬁeld goals. All of
which gives Doctor Carlson and his
boys the right to step up and say a
few words when folks begin to talk
about what team is the classiest in
this district.

Pitt hopped away to an early lead
in the game but the Titans ﬂashed the
form that has made them one of the
most feared outﬁts in this section to
pull ahead at 8-7 a.nd when the gun
failed to go off at the end of the ﬁrst
half the Vvestminster boys were still
ahead, 16-11.

W'ith Skip Hughes ﬁnally ﬁnding
the hoop for three baskets, Cribbs
and Ochsenhirt
keeping up his sensational form to
net four baskets, Pitt jumped ahead
of the Titans in the second half and
stayed there. The ﬁrst of West-
minster’s three second-half ﬁeld goals
came long after the session started.
Pitt’s stock hit a new low when
Cribbs suffered a right leg injury as
he crashed into the unprotected
bleachers at the east end of the ﬂoor,
but the courageous Panther center
stayed in the ball game to the delight
of the Pitt rooters. After that, it was
pretty much all Pitt.

Russ Ochsenhirt appeared to be in
old—time form and played a. bang-up‘
game, stealing the ball from Titans on
