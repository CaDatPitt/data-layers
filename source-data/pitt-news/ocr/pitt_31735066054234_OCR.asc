Eight initiatives targeted at improving
, undergraduates’ quality of life will be in1ple-
" mented by the provost’s oﬁice, using $1.25
. million of ﬁscal year l997’s ftmds.
‘ The University plans to implement ser-
‘ vices such as network ports in each dorm
1 room, allowing residents a direct line to any
computer service available on campus.
Other services include development of
Belleﬁeld Hall forstudent recreation, addi-
tional ftmding for disability services and
v ﬁrst-year integration into the university,
A‘-s~ extended tutorial and academic support ser-
vices, enhancement of campus safety, exper-
imental living/learning dorms, as well as
 improvement of student services like regis-
5 tration and ﬁnancial aid.
; Changes for new services and improved
1 programs are a response to recommenda-
tions by the Enrollment Management
Committee (EMC)tocreateabetterclimate
on campus for students, according to a report
released by the provost’s oﬂice in July.
Some of the changes, like supplemental
,- instruction recitations for targeted science
f‘ courses, have already been implemented
i through pilot programs.

By the year 2000, the year in which all
of these programs should be established and
working, this fall’s freshman class should
beneﬁt ﬁom shorter, faster registration lines
and better social and educational services.

The EMC, chaired by Vice Provost Jack
Daniel, was inﬂuenced by information
requested by undergraduate deans on their
existing and plarmed retention goals.

Also inﬂuencing the recommendations
was a student satisfaction survey which the
EMC used to formulate new initiatives tar-
geted at atfecting enrollment and retention
here at Pitt.

“What we looked for [in the survey]
was where we seemed to fall, not in the
absolute, but where our students were in
comparison to other institutions,” said
Robert Pack, vice provost of academic plan-
ning and resources management. “The
results were important in that they gave us a
concrete area from which to we ” Students
will be periodically surveyed over the next
few years to make sure the changes are
effectively on track.

The most positive ﬁnding the survey
revealed was student satisfaction with regard
to academic aspects, such as student and
faculty relationships.

Clinton postpones Pittsburgh trip

Russ Krebs

 

The Clinton/Gore campaign
announced Saturday that President

Clinton’s planned visit to the.

Pittsburgh area today has been can-
celled. According to the press
release, it will be rescheduled for a
later date in September.

This decision came in the wake
of an article in both the Star and
the New York Post that described
the alleged year-long affair involv-
ing the President’s top political
adviser, strategist Dick Morris, and
a former prostitute. The stories also
allege that White House secrets
were leaked to the prostitute and
that she was allowed to listen in on

  
 

 

 

   Clear 

emu:  

phone calls between Morris and the
White House.

The decision also comes after
President Clinton put U.S. Forces
in the Persian Gulf on high alert as
a result of Saddam Hussein’s Iraqi
attacks in the Kurdish north.

Adrienne Schwartz, the
Western Pennsylvania Press
Secretary for the campaign, said of
these issues, “As far as I know,
these have nothing to do with [the
cancellation]. He’s completely
fatigued, and his voice is giving
out.”

Lisa Davis, the Washington
D.C. Press Secretary for the cam-
paign, declined comment on these
issues.

MEXICO CITY President
Ernesto Zedillo pledged to fight a
new guerilla threat to Mexico’s ﬂedg-
ing economic recovery, delivering a
state—of-the-nation address that
focused on the need to level social
inequalities and raise the living stan-
dards of poor rural communities.

Zedillo avoided mentioning the
Popular Revolutionary Army (EPR),
but pledged to avoid human rights
abuses in the fight against the new
rebel group, which launched a bloody
offensive last week.

Zedillo devoted more than half
his speech to social needs, an implicit
acknowledgment that the new gueril-
las had found fertile recruiting ground
among Mexico’s discontented rural
and urban poor. The Financial Times

Judge delays decision about

Russ Krebs
 ,1. ‘ '- -9‘ :3’-:02

:~’.0'2..». - A .’<r ..:-> 

Last Thursday’s hearing to decide if a
Preliminary Injunction would be issued to
stop the temporary closing of Bigelow
Boulevard ended with no decision.

Judge Strassburger rendered his deci-
sion that “Since this is Labor Day Weekend,
let’s keep its true meaning.” He then instruct-
ed the attorneys involved that he wanted
briefs of each side’s case on his desk by
Tuesday at 11 am. Strassburger added, ‘‘If
thereneedstobeahearing,itwillbe

T Wednesday morning.”

City Council President Jim Ferlo and
State Rep. Don Walko ﬁled the lawsuit to

halt the closing along with several other
Oakland businesses and residents. The plain-
tilfs’ lead attorney, Ira Weiss, said to Judge
Strassburger, “Our case is that the vote to
close the street was inadequate.”

 “Under the State Municipal Planning
-Code you need a three-quarters majority
vote to close a public road, and not the ﬁve-
to-four vote that started the temporary clos-

Wing,” said Ferlo’s Executive Assistant and '

attorney, Paul Girdany.

However, Khadija Diggs,Assistant City W

Solicitor, said in defense, “If the owners on
; th sides of the road agree, the three—quar-
_ rule does not apply.” She went on to say

 

‘whether to slop Bigelow closing

that Pitt owns both sides of theroad and is in
agreement with the closing.

Both sides will ﬁnd out their fate and
may be back in court on Wednesday.

If the road does close temporarily, the
City will not allow the University to hold
any activities on the street.

“The City is closing the street primarily
for data to be collected and they want that to
be the primary activity,” said Jay Roling,
Director of Local Relations at the University.

“They certainly don’t have a problem
with the students crossing the street,” said
Roling.

Roling said that the City did not want
events that would normally be held on the
lawn to be moved to the street. However,
any event that has been held on the street in
the past can still be held there with a permit.

“As an example, we have closed
Bigelow in the past for Homecoming week-
end. As long as we get a permit, we can still
do this,” said Roling.

The events that were originally sched-
uled for Bigelow are still going on, but they
will occur at their usual home on the lawn.

Roling added that what the consultants

that studied the proposed closing said was

true. “We closed Bigelow between Forbes
and Fifth [Avenues] last weekend (August
22 and 23) during peak traﬂic times for
move-in and everything ran smoothly.”

Dr. Harvey L. White, an assis-
tant professor at Pitt’s Graduate
School of Public and International
Affairs, has recently been elected

National
Public

president of the
Conference of Minority
Administrators(COMPA).
COMPA’s members are made up
of minority and women city man-

/agers, government managers and
administrators, business executives,

entrepreneurs and students.
COMPA draws much of its
resources from members utilizing
their varied resources to help sus-
tain the organization.

Dr. White has contributed his
resources as editor-in-chief of the
Journal of Public Management and
Social Policy, which is published
biannually by COMPA. The journal
has been in publication since the
spring of 1995. '

“We hope to expand COMPA’s

” reach to more international bound-

aries,” Dr. White stated as one of

three main objectives he hopes to
achieve during his tenure. “We also
seek to enhance access to the World
Wide Web, and establish mentoring
programs at each of its local chap-

- ters.’’ ’

 

In keeping with expanding its
international focus, COMPA, in
conjunction with the South African
and American tertiary institutions
and organizations, is cosponsoring
the International Conference on
Public Management and
Development Administration.

The conference, headed by Dr.
White, will be held in Johannesburg
in August of 1997. The focus of the
conference will be “Transforming
and Revitalizing Public
Management and Development
Through Institution Capacity
Building.”

In addition to the South African
conference, Dr. White is also
preparing for the 1997 National
Conference to be held in Louisville,
Ky. in March of 1997. COMPA’s
focus will be‘ “Managing Change
While Maintaining Commitment.”

The COMPA presidency is part
of a four-year process involving a
one—year term as vice—president,
another one-year term as president-
elect, one year as president, and one
year as past president.

Dr. White also consults for and
is involved in other public service

agencies, including the Martin
Luther King Cultural Center,
National Conference of Black

Political Scientists, the Association

ing stickers which were attached to each
ID in the past have been eliminated.
Brinza says that when the stickers were
eliminated, it was necessary to update the
campus libraries, Lothrop Fitness Center,
the Cost Center, the Personal Computer
Center and Trees Hall with the the new
system.

Students, staff and faculty will need
to swipe their cards in order to be identi-
ﬁed as university members and check
out books or gain access to the ﬁtness
centers. Students who have not yet regis-
tered for classes will be “invalid.” In the

residence halls, those who do not reside’

in a particular residence hall will register
as “no customer” or “no privileges.” y

Concerns that returning students
have with the new PittCard include the
inabilities to distinguish who lives in
which residence hall and who is an
undergraduate versus a graduate student
by simply looking at the card.

However, those at the ID center say
that Housingholds the main data base for
all students. Therefore, faculty and staff
members can identify a student by swip-
ing their card through Housing’s data
base.

Many‘ are anxious for the new
PittCard to become completely effective.
Once the system begins, questions will
begin to be answered in more detail.
Most residence hall desk attendants are
simply waiting for the “go-ahead.”

Although some residence halls are
already using the new system as of Labor
Day weekend, many are not. The swipe
boxes and the veriﬁcation screens are
attached to the desk attendant stations.

Desk attendants on duty are simply
telling students that ask that the system is
not ready to begin. r

the residence hall question whether or not
they still need to get the new PittCard.
Beth Benz, the ID center manager, said
that upperclassmen and graduate students
do not need to get the new card irnmedi—
ately, but will eventually need to get the
PittCard and have until Oct. 11 to do so.

The ID center has arranged an ofﬁ-
cial “conversion” to take place beginning
on Sept. 23. The ID center will move
ﬁom its current location in McCormick
Hall to the Pitt Club on Thackeray Street.
There will be four stations with extended
hours during the day between Sept. 23
and Oct. 11. Those living off—campus will
need the PittCard, at the very least, for
use in campus libraries and ﬁtness cen-
ters.

Until Sept. 23, the ID center is trying
to service only new students and those
who do not already have an ID. Hours for
the ID center located in Schenley Quad
are Monday through Friday 8:30 a.m. to
6:30 p.m.

The old ID will be eﬂ"ective until the
conversion process is completed on Oct.
11.

Permanent ramp of I
benefit to students

A temporary ramp goes up behind Towers every
year, yet it has not been made permanent. It would
seem more efficient and beneﬁcial to the student
population as a whole to erect a permanent structure
in its place.

A permanent ramp would be safer than the cur-
rent makeshift plywood one being used to haul carts
loaded with the belongings of incoming students.

It is time and energy-consuming to put up and
take down a ramp every year. Building a permanent
ramp would be simple, cost-effective, and logical.
Each time the ramp is put up or taken down, it is
done at the expense of another repair" on the
University. By building a permanent structure, the
University would in one effort eradicate the burden
on the maintenance staff of dealing with the tasks
involved in the upkeep of a temporary structure.

. Another beneﬁt of making the ramp permanent I
would be to construct it so that it was wheelchair-

accessible. It would afford more convenience to the
wheelchair—bound students and visitors of the

University. There is sufficient room to curve , the -
. ramp for safe wheelchair accessibility.

There would be no drawbacks to making the
ramp permanent. As it is obviously considered a use-
ful facility for the students of this University on a
temporary basis, why not put it into permanent ser-
vice?

Child's crush shapes future relationships

 

Being the object of affec-
tion of a lovesick six-year—old
girl probably doesn’t rate for
most people as a life-changing
experience. »

Then again, I’ve never
claimed to be most people.

I met Cheryl, a very, very
blonde first-grader, on the bus
on the way home from school
—— a Christian academy in
which I had just entered in the
fifth grade — in the fall of
1971. She was certainly cute
but clearly too young for me.

But one afternoon I
noticed she was staring at me
with this very soft, warm look
on her face. Already figuring
this could be trouble, I asked
her, “Do you love me?”

She replied, “Yes” —— not
the answer  expected to hear.

Oh no, what do I do
now?!?

And for the next two years
I would play Linus Van Pelt to
Cheryl’s Sally Brown. A

Every afternoon, no matter
where I sat on the bus, she
would make a beeline for me.
(My dad took me to school in
the mornings.) She used to kiss

-;me,(one:ot' hersfavorite: tec -H
5&5; ftffiliiififlffiiiiilfl

niques was to kiss her hand
and brush it across my cheek)
and hug me like a favorite
teddy bear. Once when I was
sitting in the front seat and she
couldn’t get next to me, she
just-reached over and started
playing with my hair.

And we’re not just talking
about a school bus crush,

either. One day at recess, she,

threw her arms around me and
sang, _ “My friend.”
Embarrassing? For a 10-year-
old, yes. a

Meeting Cheryl’s father,
then a Republican state repre-
sentative, proved to be quite,
well, interesting. One evening
after we had both participated
in an assembly at church, she
dragged me over to meet him.
And let me tell you, if looks
could kill  well, I might not
be writing this now. (Was he
overprotective? Racist? I
never found out.) She later
said to me that she was told

she couldn’t attend a birthday

party for one of her classmates
if she continued to kiss me.
(Which I wasn’t going to com-
plain about.)

Now, I call this a life-
changing experience for two
reasons. One has to do with the
kind of woman I find myself
attracted to now - the fresh,
youthful-looking type as
opposed to the stunning beauty

In those formative years, about
half a dozen other girls, almost

all younger than I, had major 4

later was a no-no. (Instead,

The other concerned my
relationships —— or more accu-
rately, the lack thereof — with
black females. You see, those
other girls, like Cheryl, were
white. Not only that, but most
of the other children Cheryl
and I rode home with were

‘black, and the kind of attention

she was giving me likely upset
them. Already a neighborhood
outcast by this time anyway
and hassled continually by
those kids, I had begun to
spend most of my time with
white students.

Eventually, since I was
being drawn to other white
girls (who really did show
more interest in me), I was
branded a “honky-lover.” By

V chip isn ’t a condom to protect us fro conceptual viruses

My girlfriend, who is a nursing major, tells
me that a virus is nothing more than information.

A bomb went off in Olympic park, and
everyone began to squawk about how you can get
the information for making a bomb from the inter-
net.

A plane fell out of the sky and into the ocean
for no apparent reason. The F.B.I. searches for ﬂre
pieces and looks for information about what
caused the crash from ﬂre plane’s fragments.

' This truly is the information age. People who
live in industrialized areas are awash in infomra-

- tion.

A few of these ideas are worth playing with
a bit. Iflanguage is a virus, then the mass media is
a large ideological brothel in which a lot of virus-
es are passed around from person to person. It is
entirely possible that the intemet is responsible for
the destruction at Olympic Park. The Unabomber
did not get the designs for his bombs from the
intemet. There are wonderful books in every
library that will tell you how to make just about
anything you want, if you’re willing to actually
take the time to read.

The real danger is not from the information
on how to build a bomb or defeat airport security.
Very few people see the point of actually going to
the trouble of doing these things for entertainment
when there is so much entertainment to be derived
from television. The real trouble comes from

information which conveys ideology that con-
vinces people they must act.

In the marketplace of ideas, there are many
snake-oil salesmen hawking their wares. The
advertisements are very seductive. Sometimes the
product is completely diﬁerent from the appear-
ance. When the shysters are at their best, they
manage to convince people that foreign ideas are
their own. People no longer think for themselves,
but instead have a conceptual virus which shapes
their behavior.

media  the injection of information leads‘ to control, muta-
tion, and passive replication: the host cell ‘beIieves’that it is

foﬂowing its own biologicaﬂy determined imperative; it mis-
takes the. new genetic material for its own.” — Scott

It is time to stop worrying about pomogra-

either. The V Chip is not the intellectual condom

information and dissenting views will only
increase the incidence of fanatics trying to blow
up other fanatics. This is an uncomfortable posi-
tion for all. Soon we will be in the wasteland
where we can “neither lie, nor stand, nor sit”

It was once posited by comedian Kevin
Meany that we used to have a V Chip for our kids;
it was an education.

Although there is a glut of information, there
is a dearth of knowledge.

Information is the collection of facts and ﬁg-
ures which describes something. It can even
describe a method, but it is not universal. It is spe-
ciﬁc to a situation or a phenomenon.

Knowledge consists of the principles behind
situations and phenomena Knowledge provides
the ability to react to different situations in a man-
ner which is consistent for someone’s well being.
When faced with information. knowledge deter-

 

 

THE PITTKNEWS

mines whether or not and how well someone can
react to it _

Language is not really a virus, it is more the
ideas behind the language. Our words, our lan-
guage, is the genetic material, the adenines, gua-
nines, cytosines, and thyrnines of thought How
these things are paired up is what determines
whether we have a virus or a helpful protein.
What we get out of the mass media are mostly
viruses. The mass media rapidly reduces us to the
state of mental cripples, aﬂilicted with some debil-
itating disease. When people stop accepting what-
ever the system hands them, then they can climb
out of the wheelchair that has advertising execu-
tives for one wheel and pundits for ﬂre other

There is one catch to this, which goes back
to the question of infonnation versus knowledge,
and that is the idea that people must know what is
good. Plato prescribed musical education for all of
the people in his state in "Ihe Republic” as a way
of teaching them the difference between what was
good and what was bad.

 

We are continuously passive recipients of
infonnation. We must take charge of the environ-
ment around us and control what ﬂows into our
lives. We are only victims of ourselves. Even
though as consumers, we often seem at the mercy
of the system which exists, we can change the
way things are done, at a personal level at least.

Language is a virus — well, some of it at
least —— but we are free to survive it

As Thomas Jeﬂ’erson wrote, “all experience
hath shown, that mankind are more disposed to
suffer, while evils are suiferable.” It is time to stop
suffering. We should declare our independence
from the slime coming out from our TV sets, to
invoke the spirit of Mr. Zappa.

As a ﬁnal note, as we attempt to crusade for
higher quality, we must remember not to let ide-

ology get in the way of aesthetics. There is a guid-

ing bit of principle to keep in mind:
Congress shaﬂ make no law respecting an
establishment of religion, or the free
exercise thereoﬁ or abridging the freedom of

  

speech, or of the press; orthe right of the people
to peaceably assemble, and assemble,» and to
petiﬁon the Govemment for a redress of griev-
ances.
Not only should we be able to petition the
government for a redress of grievances, but also
the mass media, the market, and the people.

then I figured that even trying to
become friends with any of the black
girls would have been hopeless, as
K they didn’t really need me in the first
1’ place. Besides, I knew the reaction I
would get “Whatsa matta,
. Nowlin? Can’t get.a white girl?”
3 That situation hasn’t_changed.
Anyway, the whole situation
with Cheryl ended when I left the
school due to a major personality
conﬂict with the seventh—grade
teacher. I haven’t seen her since, and
I often wondered what happened to
her in those 22 years.
I would find out in July, when
her mother died.
Upon reading the obituary in the

THE PITT NEWS

Pittsburgh P0st—Ga2:ette, I decided to
call the funeral home that evening,
as I knew I wouldn’t make it over
there or to the service. We talked for
about 20 minutes, but she didn’t
remember who I was. (Bummer!)

. Now a nurse practitioner. in
Indianapolis, she said she was con-
sidering going for her doctorate at
Indiana University (the one with the
good jazz program and the infamous
Bobby Knight). when her mother
came down with cancer five years
before. She described herself as
blonde (which I knew already) and
5-foot-3 and echoed a comment I
made about being single and “not
really looking” ——- which we both

know isn’t exactly true. She also
mentioned a younger sister, whom I
barely remembered, and that her dad
wasn’t well.

She also said towards the end of
our conversation: “[Mom’s] suffer-
ing is over.—— ours has just begun.”

How poignant.

I think I’d like to see Cheryl
again. I don’t know how things
would turn out — not that it matters.

All I know is that she has a piece
of my personal history, and that suf-
fices.

Have faith,
fellow fans,
’tis a long
season

 

About a half-hour after the ﬁnal

gun last Saturday, Pitt football fans
were already busy drowning their sor-
rows.

Since the Pitt side of the stadium
virtually emptied in the middle of the
third quarter (coincidentally after the
Pitt band did the “Macarena”), -many
fans were probably on their fifth or
sixth sorrow.

Pitt inside linebacker Roderick
Humphrey may have felt like drowning
his sorrows, or drowning a teammate or
two, but he had to stick around for the
postgame press conference — a ritual
where the winning team tries not to
gloat and the losers try not to cry or kill

. any reporters.

This conference was no different
than any others until Humphrey took
the platform. After fielding a question
or two, he said something that every
Panther fan should write down and
paste onto their wall in big, bold, blue
and gold letters:

“We can’t dwell on this one. We
just have to’ get better.”

He wasn’t trying to be profound. He
wasn’t trying to be clever, insightful,

Pitt gets whipped in the "Backyard Bore"

9+‘ ‘J:
I« .«

Many experts pointed to Pitt’s season
opener against the West Virginia
Mountaineers and said that a win could
lead to a bowl beith and a loss could spell
out yet another disappointing season.

Let’s hope that the experts are wrong.

In a lackluster effort, Pitt got stomped
by West Virginia 340 Saturday night at
Pitt Stadium in front of 54,612 fans and a
national TV audience.

“We were whipped every way we
could be whipped,” Head Coach Johimy
Majors said. “We obviously have a
tremendous amount of work to do.”

A look at the ﬁnal team stats should
give us an indication of how muchwork

 

lies ahead for Pitt.

WVU amassed 18 ﬁrst downs to
Pitt’s eight. The Mountaineers rushed for
268 yards, including redshiit freshman
Amos Zereoue’s 137 — a WVU fresh-
man record. Pitt rushed for '27 yards.

Chad Johnston and the WVU passing
attack also pleased the Mountaineer faith-
ful. Johnston continually looked cool in
the pocket, dissecting Pitt’s restructured
secondary on 15 of 22 passes for 184
yards and three touchdowns. West
Virginia outgained Pitt 461-101.

Pitt’s Matt Lyﬂe looked shaky at best.
Under constant pressure from Canute

‘Curtis and the rest of the WVU defense,
Lytle completed six of 15 passes for 68
yards and one interception. He was
sacked ﬁve times, including 2.5 by Curtis.

Pete Gonzalez replaced Lytle at the 6:47.

mark of the fourth quarter where he was
one of two for six yards. Gonzalez was
sacked by the WVU defense three times,
including Pitt’s last play from scrimmage.

— . Majors feels that despite Lytle’s inef-
fectiveness, the coaching staff was correct
in sticking with him.

“Quarterbacking wasn’t our problem
tonight,” Majors said. “We didn’t want to
jerk Lyﬂe too quickly and rattle his conﬁ-
dence.”

The entire tearn’s conﬁdence got rat-
tled early. After Pitt punted on its opening
possession, Zereoue bursted around the
left end for 69 yards and his ﬁrst colle-
giate touchdown ,on his ﬁrst collegiate
carry. Less than ﬁve rriinutes into the

second overtime by not allowing the
Dukes a scoring chance in clinching the
season opener.

“This was not a pretty win, but l’ll
take it,” said Head Coach Joe
Luxbacher. “We were outplayed in the
first half. In the second, we held on and
showed a lot of courage and strength
under some adversity.”

In this game, Pitt stood up to the
challenge of playing a man down when
defender Mike Dyer was ejected late in
the second half for arguing with the ref
on a foul call. _

“A player lost his temper today
which shows no discipline. He let him-
self and the team down and there is no
excuse for that. We were fortunate to get
away with the win,” said Luxbacher.

After the ejection, the team pulled
the intensity lever up and outplayed the
Dukes in the two overtimes. They con-
trolled the ball by making precise pass-
es and winning the loose balls. The
Panthers forced Duquesne into bad
decisions and turnovers despite being a
man down.

“Right now we are trying to ﬁnd
ourselves,” said Astorino. “We are
going to improve as the season goes
along and this was a good way to start
the season.”

Goalie Adam Spitzer recorded his
20th shutout of his career in making
seven saves. He now only trails Dave
Torrence, who had 23 shutouts, for the

 
 

all—time Pitt record. Spitzer has started
all four years he’s been at Pitt and
played every minute of every game last
year.

Four minutes into the second half,
Spitzer slapped away a shot destined for
the upper right comer of the goal. It
seemed to be a perfect shot just out of
his reach, but he made the save.

“Adam Spitzer played well today.
He is someone we can always count on
to play well,” said Luxbacher.

Freshman sweeper Jeff Dyer
replaced an injured starter and helped in
preserving the shutout. Jeff is the
younger brother of teammate Mike
Dyer and former Pitt star Bobby Dyer.

“Jeff did a good job in there today
and I expected he would. He comes
from a great soccer family,” said
Luxbacher.

The Panthers are coming off their
best season ever in Big East play with
second place ﬁnishes in the conference
and Big East tournament. They also set
the school record for victories going 14-
6-1. This year they return eight starters
plus a stellar freshman class.

“This is a similar team to last year’s
in that every game we are looking for.
someone new to pick us up. We don’t
look to just a couple of players to get the
job done. Everyone contributes,” said
Luxbacher. _

Backyard‘ Brawl, WVU led 7-0.

Pitt’s special teams got the crowd
rejuvenated when Roderick Humphrey
decked Rashaan Vanterpool and forced a
fumble on punt coverage. Local hero Eric
Kasperowicz recovered for the Panthers
putting them back in business at the WVU
28-yard line.

However, one of Curtis’ sacks pre-
vented Pitt from moving the ball forward.
Nate Cochran, who punted 10 times for a
48.1 average, faked the punt and hit a
wide—open Curtis Anderson for an appar-
ent first down. Anderson dropped the ball,
a problem that plagued Pitt early, and
WVU took over on downs.

“I wasn’t worried about the drops,”
Lytle said. “I give all the credit to West

Virginia.”

Majors said, “We still might have got
whipped, but, I’ll tell you, I’d like to have
seen what would have happened if we
could have held on to a couple of balls.”

The ﬁrst play of the second quarter
placed Pitt in a deeper hole. Vanterpool,
who earlier in the week called himself the
best receiver in college football, caught his
lone pass of the day —- a 33-yard dive pat-
tern from Johnston to give-West Virginia a
14-0 lead. Vanterpool injured himself on
the play and did not return.

A letdown on special teams cost Pitt in
the closing minutes of the first half.
WVU’s Mike Logan, a native of
McKeespo1t, returned a punt 30 yards to
the Pitt 19 with 2:38 remaining.

.Pitt’s defense, urged on by all-time
Panther great Hugh Green standing on the
sidelines, stopped fullback Anthony Green
on three straight plays to force a 20-yard

Jay Taylor ﬁeld goal making the score 17- .

0 at the half.

Zereoue picked Pitt’s defense apart in
the ﬁrst half, rushing for 127 yards on just
six carries, including the long touchdown
jaunt.

“I told people earlier in the week
about Zereoue,” West Virginia Coach Don
Nehlen said. “I told them that they would
be hearing a whole lot about him by the
end of Saturday night.”

Although Zereoue looked dynamic in
his ﬁrst game, the Pitt defense does not
feel that he will be the best nmning back
they see this season.

“No, he’s not the best we’ll see this
year,” Humphrey said. “Zereoue took us
by surprise tonight.”

His counterpart, Billy West, playing
for the ﬁrst time since Sept. 30, did not
take any Mountaineer defender by surprise
last Saturday. West rushed only 14 times
for 59 yards, all in the ﬁrst half. Most of
his yards came on a 27-yard burst on Pitt’s
ﬁrst possession.

Just when it looked as if Pitt might
have some momentum, West Virginia took

“ it away. On the opening kickoff of the sec-

ond half, returner Alvin Swoope ﬁelded
the kick at the 3-yard line and eluded Pitt’s
coverage team. The 91-yard kickoﬁ’ retum
gave West Virginia the ball at the Pitt four-
yard line. On the next play, Johnston found
Shawn Foreman in the comer of the end
zone to give WVU a 24-0 lead.

“I thought the kickoff to start the sec-
ond half made it tough for them [Pitt],”
Nehlen said. His record against Pitt now
stands at 9-6-1 (6-3 at Pitt Stadium.)
‘They could have built up some momen-
tum.”

West Virginia, who has won ﬁve
straight against Pitt, ended the scoring
onslaught with drives of 90 and 80 yards.
The latter drive was highlighted by third-
suing rimning back Khari Mott’s 63-yard
dash through the middle.

go light up Kent State Saturday night.
There is nothing like a Division I—AA
pass rush and a Division I-AA sec-
ondary to increase a quarterback’s con-
ﬁdence level if he’s willing to put the
past behind him.

The Pitt offensive line can’t dwell
on a 101-yard, eight—sack opener. On
more than one occasion Saturday, a pan-
icky Lytle took off out of the pocket
before he was in any real danger and
was dropped for a yard or less. Billy
West showed a similar lack of trust,
missing a few holes up the middle in a
frantic search for a way around the sus-
pect Pitt front ﬁve.

As tough as it is to forget, veteran
trench warriors like Tony Orlandini, Jeff
Craig and Reggie Thomas have to in
order to regain their quarterback’s trust
and West’s faith. Take a quick look at
the tape to straighten out the blocking
schemes, and then hit the weight room
or the track or the practice ﬁeld. It’s the
only way to get better.

On the other side of the ball,
Panther defenders can’t dwell on Amos
Zereoue. The freshman ﬂash is over -
it’s time to go back to work. Study up on

the next opponent so that Humphrey '
