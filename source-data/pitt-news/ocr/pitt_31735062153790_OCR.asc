The musicians left Pittsburgh on
Tuesday, December 26, and made the

very much at ‘home in Mercer, because
of tlhe cordial welcome given by the

RESEARCH MEN
WILL UNITE

Pitt and.Carnegie Take Active
Part—Dr. R. F. Bacon Is
Chairman.

 

 

Mobilization of -the scientiﬁc re-
search institutions of the United
States, including the Mellon Institute
of Industrial ‘Research, Pittsburgh,
and the Carnegie Institution labora-
tories, is recommended in a report,
one of the most important and com-
prehensive ev_er ﬁled, on research in
industrial laboratories, just completed
by a su=b-committee. of the committee
of 100 on scientiﬁc research, of. which
former body Dr. Raymond‘F. Bacon,
director of the Mellon Institute, is
chairman. .

The mobilization, according to the
recommendation of the sub-commi,t-
tee, is to ‘be achieved through the or-
ganization of an association of all
b_o-dies engaged “in scientiﬁc and in-
dustrial research. Besides those men-
-tioned, the report s-peciﬁes as eligible
to membership in such an associa-
tion the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, and other educational in-
stitutions, and the research labora-
tories of corporations. which are con-
ducting a certain amount of research
of scientiﬁc importance.

Interchange of Ideas.

“Undoubtedly,” the report con-
tinues, ‘‘an association_ of this nature
would meet with satisfactory support,
and it would eventually prove an im-
portant factor in improving _the
methods-of research organization.”

It is further recommended that the
activities o-f the association for mutual
beneﬁt include the interchange of
subjects for research; special facili-
ties for extraordinary conditions, such
as extreme pressures, extremes of
temperatuie, etc.; special pieces of ex-
pensive apparatus, helpful ‘ideas-of re-
search‘ already in progress, and can-

   
 
 

 -ing: the econfierenice

nuational fraternity, and Phi Gamma
Delta was early decided upon. Eight I
attempts were made to procure a
charter, but the first seven failed, last
year’s Ekklesia refusing the petition
by a very small vote. At this year’s -A .-
Ekklesia, which was held December
28-31, 1916, at Cleveland, Ohio, the

.For‘some.t‘ime we have bieenprvomising to print a seriescf pictures of

track teams, as well as those of the dramatic, literary, musical and other organizations whichiﬂourished in the-last
of years. .We believe this will be an attractive featureth the Alumni Page. ' A ..
_ -The. ﬁ_rst of the series is shown above-the 1901 football, team. ’ This was one of the‘bes't football teams that
was tu_rned out by W. U- P. up to'1904. and was. captained by _Malé'olxr_l F. McConnell and coached ‘by’VVilbur D..
.H'ockensr_nlitll. It defeated Geneva Co1lege,.13_-6, whenthey had such stars as “Joe” Thompson, “Jud” Schmidt,
“Joe” Edsar..Wa1ter East and “Art” ‘McKean, who -later entered the Universityhand ihelped-put W. U. P. on the.
map-in football. It'also won from'West Virginia University, Allegheny and othertearns, the only defeat being at’
the handsﬂof Penn Stat'e,'23-0. As can be surmised, State had a greatteam that year, as they usually did. -

_  Almost all the men shown ‘in the picture _abov.e are well known to the-alumni. ' “Dick” Wallace is president of.
the Varsity Letter Club and "takes an active interest in alumni and athletic activities at Pitt. He lives in Millvale,
