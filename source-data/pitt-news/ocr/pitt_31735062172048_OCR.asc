Commuting F r0sh.May

S Miss Dormitory Stay

by RON LOZOWSKI

Freshmen commuters who wish
to experience dorm living mav
be unable to do so. if they can-
not attend a special June Orien-
tation session for commuters.

This vear. in contrast to pre-
vious vears when there were sev-
eral sessions. freshman Orienta-
tion will feature onlv' two separ-
ate sessions: on June 18-20 for
commuters and one late in Aug-
ust for dorm residents.

According to John Vrana. Dir-
ector of Housing, it might be
possible to house a small num-
ber of commuting freshmen in
the dorms during August. But be-
cause the Housing Office must
prepare rooms for fall resi-
dents late that month, it would
be difficult, Vrana said, to ac-
commodate more than 30 fresh-
men commuters at that time.

Vrana added that the Housing
Office would trv to be “flexi-
ble" on the matter and trv to
provide rooms for freshmen com-
muters. He stressed.‘ however.
that onlv a limited amount of
space will be available.

Vrana explained thatythere are
two problems involved: 11)
manv students planning to stav
in the dorms send there their
belongings earlv to the rooms

thev" will occupv. and (2) time
is needed to "turn over" the
rooms.

“Turning over” rooms, said

Vrana, involves preparing rooms
for their next occupants-cleaning
the room,
Vrana

changing the linen.

said that despite the

seemingly simple nature of the
task, it is a time consuming
one, and one that must be
performed by union employees.

Vrana argued that it would be
possible to accommodate a large
number of commuters at the Au-
gust session. since the rooms
could not be readied in time for
returning students. This situation
is not applicable to freshmen
who will be living in the dorms.
since during Orientation these
students merelv move into the
rooms thev will be occupving for
the coming term.

Richard Box. Chairman of the
Orientation Committee. said that
though incoming freshmen com-
muters might not be able to »live
in the dorms during the August
Orientation session. they were
nevertheless invited to partici-
pate in the accompanving acti-
vities. Box also suggested the
possibilitv of rooms for fresh-
men commuters being found else-
where on campus. such as at fra-
ternitv houses.

Allecatiens Meetings E’_1:1_’.!.i.<3-

Last week. Bernard Koboskv.
Vice Chancellor for Student
Affairs. approved a svstem of
checks and balances to prevent
inequeties in the funding of stu-
dent organizations.

The new allocating procedure
calls for open allocation l1ear—
ings and the approval bv all four
commissioners when reviewing
the Student Association budget.

Dennis Concilla. Programs
Commissioner: Lennv Klavonic.
Social Commissioner: Wade Law-
son. Committees Commissioner’:
Ted Michalik. Academic Com-
missioner: Bill Markus. Advisor
to the Student Association; and
Tom Tackage. Assistant Director

of Student Activities created the .

new svstem.

Markus said, “Students should
attend the meetings to offer in-
put and criticisms. They and
coverage by the Pitt News are
the only viable checks on this
system.”

Funds are to be allocated in
this manner:

First. a student organization
submits its budget for review
bv
Then the Student Association
ithe Social Commission plus
the four commissioners) hears
the recommendation of the A110-
cations Committee at an open
hearing.

If the Allocations Committees
recommendation is approved the
student organization is funded.

If not. the proposed budget is
sent back for review bv the

sion.

Within a week the Allocations
Committee again presents the re-
vie‘wed budget to the Student

Association at an open hearing.

If not approved a second time.
according to point six of the pro-
cedure: “An open meeting will
be called with the four commis-
sioners and the Allocations Com-
mittee to resolve the impasse.
The commissioners can ammend
the Allocations Committee re-
commendation with a 3/4 majori-
ty. When reviewing any and all
aspects of the Student Associa-
tion budget. a unanimous vote of
all four commissioners is neces-
sary to amend the Allocations
Committee’s recommendation.”

To clarifv point six the recent-
lv approved svstem of checks

and balances states. “One of our.’ ._

prime obiectives here is to re-
move the Social Commission

from the compromising role of 2

amending budgets when their
own budget represents a_‘signi—

ficant portion of the total allo-

cated.“ _ . ’“

This budgetarv safeguardhsvs-'
term was proposed at a May 7
meeting of the Commissioners
because the Universitv. as col-
lector of student activities fees.
is legally accountable for ‘the
the disbursement of these fees. '

Concilla, Lawson, and Mich-
alik said they feel that the Stu-
dent Association constitution; pre-
vented them from making strong-
er checks on this system of allo-
cation. Said Concilla, “The con-
stitution handcuffed us.”

"The weakness is that the So-
cial Commission is still voting
on its own budget." Michalik
stated. He and Lawson termed
the Social Commissions involve-~_
ment in its budgetarv decisions
as “too political.“ Lawson point-
ed out that "the Social Com-
mission has a vested interest that
could affect decisions in ‘re-.
gard to other organizations."

Lawson suggested another or-
ganization to act as a buffer in
decisions concerning decisions ,
for the Social Commission. He
also said that since the four com-
missioners do have varying in-
terests. the power for ' final"
decisions should rest with them.

Close Berkeley Paper

The Daily ‘Californian. student newspaper at the University of
California at Berkeley. faces shutdown because of a recently published
editorial.

The editorial expressed strong support for a demonstration held
in commemoration of the second anniversary of the Universitvs re-
clamation of Peoples‘ Park.

In May 1969, the students converted a site intended for Univer-
sity housing into a park forlocal residents. Now known as Peoples’ Park.

the site was the scene of a violent encounter between students and Nation
al Guardsmen that resulted in one death and several injuries.

The editorial read in part. “For two vears our boycott of the park
has stood witness to the blood that flowed there. It is time we honored
that blood with action—-we must take back the park.“ The editors had
also published front page editorials calling for nonviolent action.

Psychiatrists Testify

Marijuana, Neurosis Linked?

Two psychiatrists have linked
the regular use of marijuana by
adolescents with impaired judge-
ment. distorted perception. and
listlessness.

Testifying before the National
Commission on Marijuana and
Drug Abuse on Monday. May
17. Drs. Harold Kalonsky and
William Thomas Moore reported
that the drug produced a toxic
reaction on the central nervous
systems of 38 individuals tested.

The New York Times reported
the psychiatrists as saving.
"We feel there should be no con-
fusion. because regardless of the
underlying psychological diffi-
culty. mental changes--hall-
marked by disturbed awareness
of self, apathy. confusion and poor
reality testing--will occur in an
individual who smokes mari_j-
uana on a regular basis whether

~ he is a normal adolescent. an adol-.

escent in conflict. or a severely
neurotic individual.

Those who are already ill will
become additionally affected by
marijuana use. and thereby reduce
their chance for recovery.Those
who are balancing between mental
health and illness will lose their
balance. and those who are healthy
will eventually become sympto-
matic after prolonged exposure
to the toxicity of marijuana.“

According to the TIMES,
Shafer told the A_ commission,
“We feel that there would be much
less heroin addiction today if the

marijuana problem had been tackled

The PEP program. first incor-
porated into the Frick School.
was designed in consideration
of children in a pre—school. ur-
ban setting. The PEP curriculum
employs more -game-like and
manipulative activities and less
self-prescription on the part of
the student.

Since their inception. the two
programs liaye consolidated many
of their features into both
schools.

The Learning Research Pro-
gram of the Center. with labor-
atories in the Mineral Industries
Building, makes studies into
human behavior and the psycho-
logy of learning. the results of
which are channeled into the
development of instructional
materials and methods. In addi-
tion, problems which arise in the
experimental schools or in the
developmental programs are
studied by staffs headed by
faculty members who are spec-
ialists in their respective fields.

us in?”

Athletic Director (Tasimir .\Iyslinski is a sym-

may yet succeed in getting Oaklaiid youths to

Why not open up the Stadium to the com-
munity?

"We wouldn't iust open up the Stadium be-
cause then you get vandals into the thing and
they break various things in the Stadiuni.“ .\ly-
slinski responds.

Why not pay tor supervision. then. if coin-

“I don‘t think the l'niyersity should spend
any more than it is spending right now.”

"If students volunteer to supervise. which

Besides. .VIyslinski adds. the I'niyei‘sity‘s "pri-

After all. he reasons. students might be dis-

inunity were given the privilege. "In order to
have a recreational program." Myslinski explains.
"you have to reserve facilities for people.

Sexism Perpetrated
by Publicity Stunt

It was a verv sunnv dav at the l’ittsburgh Point on Tuesday. Re-
ports estimate that almost twentv thousand gathered to watch a KQV’
fun dav combination a Hot Pants Contest and a free concert bv
Hair cast members.

I was surprised that the cast of Hair would consent to such a
sexist venture. Capitalism. mavbe. but not sexism. After all. isn‘t
the cast of Hair supposed to be “ideologicallv pure?” So manv sav-
ings have been coined from the production that onlv lead up to
the entire Age of Aquarius being free from discrimination of anv
tvpe.

Nevertheless, they were still coupled with the KQV meat par-
ade of the century. alas, double jeopardy!

I expected a free performance of the plav eventuallv. because
it was sort of piggish for the cast of Hair to charge outlandish pric-
es to see their obviouslv hvpocritical plav.

The real deep down problem is still the Hot Pants Contest
itself. Females were herded together. in order to choose the nicest
bodv from the bunch. I guess that is all that matters in a male—fe-
male relationship. We all know that everv ‘girl shuld be able to
cook and clean. but most important she should have a nice figure
in order to show her off.

KQV disc iockevs must reailv believe that garbage in order to
conduct such a miserable contest. however thev insulted not onlv
females but males too.

KQV and other similar capitalists stiffle and threaten human
beings by perpetrating the entire sexist cycle. Unfortunately, the
entire myth of traditional dating. marriage and rapid child hear-
ing is reinforced by such publicity ventures by putting females in a
position secondary to males.

Don't people understand that it is a bit ridiculous for a human
being to stop her intellectual development in order to have a child‘?
A male also stops his mental growth when he has to go out and get a
job he doesnt want to support the outgrowth of the relationship. This
is a stereotvpe which most males never stop to realize.

I wonder why most people never stopped to figure out that the
constant cycle of reproduction on the earth virtually threatens the ex-
tinction of the human race. Medical technology has extended the
human life cycle, and if more babies are born into the sexist condi-
tioned atmosphere of constant reproduction, we will crowd ourselves
off the earth. I

In a bizarre  the“ end result of sexism is sort of funnv. but
its a shame that the KQV disc iockevs. all of the other "girl watch-
ers“. and the cast of Hair‘ wont be around to see the finale.

Editor:

If the world goes on its merrv
wav. heedless of the plaintive
cries of such as Michael Simon
i“War Kills. Continuesz" The Pitt
News; Mav 18. the fault rests
not. I believe. with the worlds
apathv. but with i\lr. Simons
patent absurditv.

This absurditv is. at times. the
result of slipshod expression. as
when Mr. Simon writes. "two
and one half times the bomb
tonnage dropped on Hiroshima
is used bv the Us. in Indochina."
Since Hiroshima is best known
for having onlv one bomb drop-
ped on it—tl1e atomic bomb—with
a small tonnage and a large kil-
oton force. Mr. Siman probably
means to sav that the US has
dropped on Indochina the equi-
valent of two and one—half times
the explosive force of the atom-
ic bomb dropped on Hiroshima.

And, of course, anyone with
any sense of reality would sim-
ply yawn at this pointless sta-
tistic and muse upon how much
more explosives we could have
unloaded in W.W. II if we had
been dumping it on “probable
troop concentrations” in forests
and jungles instead of on ci-
ties. ,

At other times the apparent
cause of .\Ir. Simon's absurditv
is a garbled version of facts.
When he writes that. "the land
is going scorched so badlv that
it cannot be used for agricultur-
al purposes.“ a critical reader is
likelv to dismiss this as being
pure bash. Mr. Simons idea here
probablv goes back to a warning
delivered to Mr.
group of agricultural specialists
to the effect /that continued

Pitt Z’/zaztrc Stages Szzroa/4 Play ’

by CHARLES LEVINE

The Pitt Theatre Arts Depart-
ment will present William Sar-

spring production. Directed by F.
Curtis Canfield. the show will be
staged at Stephen Foster .\Iem-

orial the evenings of June 4. 3.
9. 10. 11, and 12.

Saroyan. one of the most re-
spected short story writers in
American Literature. used the
same free—association and stream
of conciousness techniques in
Time Of Your Life that gave his
short—stories such an overwhelm-
ing freshness. It is as wayward

Compared to any tightly fuge from a‘ menacing world

with the Saroyan-child-like en-
thusiasm.

Time Of Your Life, was
conceived in dance and musical
patterns. and requires actors who
can dance. play the piano or har-1

it specifies the subtlest modula-
tions of lighting.

Director Canfield says the pro-

stresses Saroyans own state-

"Seek goodness everywhere. and
when it is found. bring it out of
its hiding place and let it be free
and unashamed."

°Mad Dogs’ All Bark And No Bite

by STEVE ZYCH

Rockfilms Woodstock and
Gimme Shelter certainly had cin-
ematic style. quality, and a sense
of structure and unity. Mad Dogs
and Englishmen, rockfilm now
playing at the Shadyside and
featuring Joe Cocker. has none
of these virtues. In fact. it offers
little more than Cocker and his
raucous. hard-driving rock.

The film is terribly disjoint-
ed, and the use of a three-way
split screen only adds to the con-
fusion of colors and sounds pre-
sented. The film’s biggest debit
is it’s total lack of any depth-it

never really focuses on anything

but Cocker. As a result, the few
scenes with reporters, groupies,
the press and others are shallow.

The only exception is an interest-
ing interview with an aging but
extremely sexually agile group-
ie in Texas.

Otherwise. the film centers
entirely on Cocker. who looks
like an ecstatic epileptic when
performing with his freaky and
far out 42-member touring com-
pany.

Summing up: A pointless psy-
chedilic paean to Joe Cocker.

"Turkey" Cold

Norman Lear‘s (director of tel-
evisions All in the Familylat-
tempts at relevant social satire
on the idiot box -have won criti-
cal acclaim. This type of humor.
however. doesn't quite make it
in his latest movie Cold Turkey,

currently featured at many local
theaters.

The preposterous plot concerns
a small town in Iowa which is
promised $25,000,000 by a weal-
thy tobacco magnate as a pro-
motional stunt if all of the in-
habitants of the town can give
up smoking for one month. The
film tries to depict the eccentric
efforts of the crazed citizenry to
win the prize, but as this futile

flick plods on, the viewer hard-_

ly cares about the outcome.

The problem is that Lear tries
vainly to mix all this madness
with mindless messages. These
only serve to bog the film down
in pointlessness.

An example is Lear‘s attempt to
show to what great lengths peo-

ple will go for money. He has
three persons killed by other
frantic townspeople because they
might have ruined the town's
chances of winning the loot. The
scene is handled so inep 1V in its

  

efforts to achieve black humor
that it comes off neither as hum-

orous nor tragic. It is as point-
less as the rest of this preten-
tious bit of so-called satire.

Scores Two Runs

 

By JANICE BUCCIGROSSI

DUNCANSVILLE. Pa. — The
highlight of the Panther mitters‘
weekend trip to Penn State for a
scheduled doubleheader was
their overnight stay in Duncans-
ville. Pa.

Duncansville. a town where
the only action can be found
watching tracks go by on the
highway. had more to offer the
Panthers than the Penn State
Nittany Lions who trounced
Pitt 4-1 and 7-2 in the twin-bill
played on Saturday.

Mike Niccols recorded his
first loss against five wins in
the first of two while Al Sylan-
ski. now 4-2. was tagged for the
loss in the second game.

Pitching, however, was not the
problem for the Panthers. “It
was the best I’ve pitched all
year,” related Niccols.

"Our pitchers did a good job."

Grove City Shuts Out
Netters In Final Meet

by JAN FRY

It didn‘t rain this time when
the Pitt tennis team met Grove
City last Wednesday in their re-
scheduled and final meet of the
season. However. the rain would
have fit in with theatmosphere
as the Panthers lost 9-0 in their
most depressing competition of
the year.

All the sets were relatively

close: Pitt taking 65 games to

Grove City‘s 120. However. as
Pitt Coach Fran Webster ex-
plained it. "Where the winning
point was needed the netters
didn't have the strength.“

In the number one spot junior
Gary Schwartz played his usual
tough. consistant game but lost
6-3. 6-3. Mike O‘Loughlin in
number two singles and Bill

Wood in the third position.

played according to Webster
"very well but couldn't bring
enough power through to win."

The scores were 6-3. 6-4: 9-7.
8-6 respectively.
Sophomore Les Abromovitz

won the only set for Pitt, 3-6 in
the fourth spot but eventually
lost 6-2, 6-3 in a hard played
match.

Due to his studies. Jorge Gut-
ierrez couldn’t travel with the
squad. so doubles player Jon
Flint filled the fifth slot in
singles and played so well that
the coach thought he‘d win.
However. he dropped the match
6-1.7-5.

In the final singles competi-
tion Tom McKnight didn't. fair
so well and was defeated 6-3.
6-1.

Les Abromovitz battles in a losing cause.

- ph,oto_by Donaldson

 

Doubles competition was also
close and Webster believes the
squad could have taken the
matches. Wood and O’Loughlin
fell 6-2, 8-6 in the number one
spot and in number two Schwartz
and Abromovitz were defeated
6-2, 6-4.

The Flint and Klein team. who
had a two meet winning streak
were finally defeated in a 6-0.
6-4 match. '

"Grove City has to be the
most depressing meet of our
season." remarked Webster. "To

place so close. give such a good
battle. and not score has to be
depressing.“

The coach cited the opening
competition with West Virginia
as the highlight of the squad’s 2-
13 season. Pitt came back 0-4
to take the meet 5-4 from WVU.

"We, were a stronger team
then with Joel tHurwitzi and
.\like lPines). "Webster explain-
ed. The other win of the season
was the intra-city Duquesne
meet.

"We didnt have the big game
to win those close sets. "Web-
ster pointed out. "However I
am satisfied with the improve-
ment the boys made“ throughout

the season and next year looks
promising."
With" the addition of three

strong recruits. ladder tourna-
ments in the fall. and the use of
indoor courts in the winter. the
coach believes his young team
will mature and look more prom-
ising. ‘

—Pool Sharks Go——

For the first time since
it was opened several years
ago, the giant olympic-size
pool in Trees Hall will be
drained and cleaned out.

This iob is no small task
considering the 750,000 gal-
lons of water that fills the
pool. It will take almost
two weeks to refill it. This
project is tentatively sche_-
duled for sometime this sum-
mer.

The pool will also be re-

Shortstop Jerry .\Iurph_y fol-
lowed with a single to center
field. and Swanson walked to
load the bases. Mike Smith drove
home the two runs with a sin-
gle to right field.

The Panthers scored their lone
run in the fifth when Bob Liv-
ingston. who had been hit by a
pitch. scored on a single by
pinch hitter Paul Quarantillo.

Pitt had little success scor-
ing runs in the second game as
they scattered nine hits while
picking up only two runs.

The Panthers scored one of
their two tallies in the fifth inn-
ing when center fielder John
Fredland, two for three in the
second contest, opened up the
inning with a single past third.

Fredland advanced to second
on a single up the middle by
pitcher Sylanski. Right fielder
Bob Solonickne scored Fredland
from second on a shot past
third.

It seemed that the Panthers
might rally in the seventh when

inning with a single up the mid-

The losses became significant as the District 2 NCAA
playoff committee went to the polls on Sunday to select the
teams that will go to the tournament. Pitt was not among .1 

their selections.

The entire situation is significant because in the past-
the voting was held prior to the-Pitt-Penn State confronta- 
tion which meant that the results of that battle did not enter ' 
into the voting. Pitt, in the last two years, has been shut-out All
of the tournament while Penn State was not and the Cats’ 5;

felt that they had gotten the raw end of the deal. The pro-- _*- 
mise of the bid after a victory over Penn State did not become V ‘ _
a reality until this year. The only problem is that the mit-

According to Barry Jones. one of the two assistant sports ,1‘,
information directors at Penn State. where this year's voting , is
was held. "Penn State was the first team ,c-hosen. then Buf- ‘

"The onlv teams that were talked about were West Vir-

had never been in the running. "Although West Virginia had

a better record <26-6). Seton Hall was picked because the"
committee felt that Seton Hall played a tougher schedule. "

The double elimination tournament continues on Friday H, _
with four games on tap. At 12 p.m. on Saturday the cha-m-  “

South Gets First Win
In Area All-Star Game

by MARTY HELLMAN
Associate Sports Editor

Timely hitting and tight pitch‘-
ing by the South all—stars on Sun-
day afternoon at Three Rivers
Stadium enabled them to whip
the North all-stars 7-2 in the an-
nual 'l‘ri-State (‘ollege Coaches
Association contest. '

The victor_v marked the first
win for the Southern squad in
the series which started three
years ago.

Because no West Virginia play-
ers participated for the South.
the team was-comprised mainly
of Point Park. Fi'ostbiii'g State.
and (.‘alifornia State ballplayeis

Although the three South pit-
chers allowed eight hits, the
North players could manage to
score in only one inning, the
fifth. The Southerners took ad-

vantage of several North miscues
to add to their total of nine hits
to score their runs.

Both sides were blanked by‘
starting pitchers Joe tlregula of
(‘alifornia State of the South
and Dave l\'erestly of tirove (‘ity
of the .\'orth in the first three
innings. .

In the fourth. the South broke
the ice by getting a lone tally
off Clarions Leo Vrcek. the los-
ing pitcher. With one out. Frost-
burgis George .\1oraz, walked
and advanced to third via a
throwing error by Vrcek and a
passed ball.

Point Park’s Dennis Wingert-
sahn blooped a double into short
left field to knock in the first
South run.

The South added two more in
the fifth to provide the team
with the eventual winning mar-

Shortstop Terry Stokes was the only Panther to reach base in all-
star game.

in the field for the North squad.

Bob Solonickne all played un-
til the fifth. Livingston and
Maeha were previously named

test in the sixth at shortstop when
the North coaches substituted
for the starters. Panther hurler
Mike Niecols did not see ac-
tion because he pitched on Sat-
urday.

counted for one walk and eight
outs as they had a rough day
at the plate. Stokes drew the

Theodore .\'. Bobby is the
kind of athlete track coach Jim
Banner wants on his team.

Most coaches of any sport
desire versitile athletes to coin-
plement the specialists. Bobby
fills that bill for Banner. In
fact. Banner prefers versatility
over specialty.

Versatility on a track team
usually means that an athlete
will compete in a couple of

different events. Bobby's multi-
talents are a little more unique.

"Ted can run. hurdle. and
jump.“ emphasizes Banner. "He
would even be a good man in
the 880 yard dash. "

In last weeks dual meet
against Temple L'niversity. Bob-
by showed his worth to the
track team.

In the long jump. Bobby fin-
ished second behind Bill Rea
with a 22 foot 8 inch jump. In
the 440 intermediate hurdles.
the Butler native also finished
second after leading most of the
way. and only the intense heat
prevented him from running on
the mile relay team.

Ted‘s the

showing in long

_§ jump encouraged him to specu-

late on his future intentions in
that event.

"If I worked at it.“ he said.

"I could probably , make 25
feet."

I‘TIiat‘s what makes a good
athlete.” Banner was prompted
to say. “He can look at an ev-
ent and believe he can do it."

"There aren't too many good
specialists.“ continued Banner.
"Unless an athlete is a top spe-
cialist. he iBobb_vi is the t_vpe
of athlete we look for.“

Bobby had a lot of pressure on
him when he began competing
for the tracksters. He had to re-
place a speedy (‘arlos Reisen
on the mile relay team. At first.
a few problems arose.

Dennis Schatzman and Bobby
had a little trouble in handing
off the baton. On two occasions

Bobby dropped the baton in
competition.

"It‘s a case of getting used
to each other." said Banner at
that time.

Well. with the help of glass-
es. Bobby "got used to it very
well.

With Bobby. regulars Smittie
Brown, Dennis Schatzman, and
Dorel Watley were able to win
the mile relay on almost every
occasion. The quartet holds the
indoor Pitt record in the mile
relay and it is hoped that they
can set a new outdoor record
before the outdoor season runs
its course.

 Versatile ‘Bobby Does It All

Because Temple I'niversity
had a good sprinting core. Bob-
by was entered in the long jump
to try and add points to the Pitt
field events. Bobby not only ad-
ded points. but finished ahead
of the Temple first line jump-
er.

Banner has built a ver_v ver-
satile team by choice. Bill Rea
can long and triple jump. Smit-
tie Brown could run the 440.
the half mile as well as hurdle.
but. the difference with Bobby
is that he could fill in the field

events as well as in the sprint— _._

ing.

In the fall. Bobby will be-
gin his junior year under Ban-
ner. This means that he will

have both 2 indoor seasons and’

2 outdoor seasons left on his

eligibility.

Because injuries play such an
important role in track. it seems
logical" that Bobby will yet see
a lot of varied action in the fu-
ture. Banner for example, indi-
cated thathe would like to try
Bobby in the 880.

Pitt Racer

To Battle
T01) Stars

by GEARY JOHN'S

After winning its initial race
of the season and damaging the
car _in the second meet. the
Pitt Camaro attempted to bet-
ter itself in its next race.

In the third race of the spring

circuit. The (‘umberland Na-
tionals in .\Iaryland. the car
began the race in 13th posi-

tion out of a field of 33 racers.

In the 1.7 miles per lap. 30
lap race. l~‘ryer had the car in
the lead for half the race until
the car encountered brake trou-
ble and had to slow down it’s
pace.

Only one car passed the Ca-
maro during this time, the even-
tual winner, Warren Agor. How-
ever. there is always a bright
note in defeat. Both the win-
ner and the Camaro broke the

existing lap record by more than ‘

18 seconds.

Fryer said about the race. "We
were running well. We were ex-
cellerating well but the hand-
ling was the worst of all. Then
we encountered brake failure
and had to hold back."

On June 6 the race team trav-
els to the Mid Ohio Trans Am.
a 3 hr. drive from Pittsburgh.
This will be the first big race
of the curcuit for the Camaro.
Many of the big name drivers.
such as Parnelli Jones and Mark

Donahue. will be entered in
this meet.
The Mansfield, Ohio race

course is 2.5 miles long and is
run at an average of 1 min. and
40 sec. ‘per lap.

"Were only in this race to
see if we can make a good show-
ing." Fryer stated. “These are
the really big bo_vs. I just hope
to finish decently. “

At the present time. Fryer is
leading the North Eastern Rac-
ers in points with 15.
