trated.”

“Money is being poured in [to organiza-
tions], -and we saw the real hard truth that it
doesn’t always get where it’s supposed to, and
they’re not as effective as people say they are,”
said Aliu. _

So SLIl\/I took matters into its own hands.
The group works with native Malawian

Loon said.

“SLIM narrowly focused on medicine
when it first got started,” explained Aliu. “As
we did more research, we realized the world
isn’t just different spheres of health and eco-

nomics, but it’s all connected.”

The group managed to connect the ﬁve
CBOs — Mwana Wa Nzako, Mchenga, Par-
adiso, Luzi and Tilerane —— on its first trip.
Now the ﬁve villages have monthly meetings
to discuss problems in the area.

their time between researching on health,
economic and human rights issues and tak-
ing trips out to the ﬁve villages and ‘getting to
know the people in them.

They held a general meeting with the
community about every three days, said Aliu.
About 100 to 200 people would show up to
listen _to a panel composed of Student Lead-
ers, different community leaders and direc-

‘ tors.

The leaders talked about problems in the
community “more for our beneﬁt, since the

community already knew ‘these things,” and
the ‘Student Leaders asked questions, said
Aliu.

After the public meetings SLIM held pri-
vate meetings with the community leaders to
discuss project planning. “The communities
needed things like access to clean water,” said
Rosenbloom.

The major goal of SLIM’s trip then was
to plan project goals for each community
designed to help them attract business or to
improve the sanitary conditions.

They found that Mwana Wa Nzako needs
a parafﬁn pump so the people can sell fuel,
Mchenga needs a borehole for clean drinking
water, Paradiso could use a pick-up truck for
easier transfer of AIDS patients, Luzi needs a
bakery to manage feeding all of the orphans
from family with AIDS it takes in, and Tiler-
ane needs .a pig farm for feeding it orphans
as well.

When SLIM wasn’t in meetings, the group
was out in the community.

“One of the cornerstones of the project
was to get involved at the community leve ,”
said Aliu.

The group stayed with a CBO clirector’s
grandmother. They called her “Gogodas,”
which means “grandrnother” in ll\/Ialawian.

They met her relatives and helped her cook j

They laughed, recalling the time that
they helped her make “nsima,” a corn por-
ridge. Cooking on a wood stove was harder
than it looked. "To stir thelpot takes a lot of

V strength,” said Aliu. “She was better at it than

me.” .
I The group befriended local vendors, often

_ taking them out to lunch.

SLIM said its goals had not yet been met;
It needs more fundraising to help fund the
project proposals written up during the 2008
trip, which is why the group is going back
next year, from May to June.

Student Leaders will‘ choose the next
group from within its organization by the end
of the fall semester. I

knockdown anywhere.”

Both candidates traded blows on issues in-
cluding the ﬁnancialciisis and foreign policy
during the 90-minute debate. According to
the Nielsen TV Ratings, one in every three
households watched as moderator Jim Lehrer
presented nine lead questions to both senators:
four about the economy and ﬁve concerning
foreign policy.

Shuster said Obama and McCain “talked in
generalizations” about the ﬁnancial crisis but
focused on “differing personal philosophies”
in foreign policy. But he said Obama showed

strength and experience when discussing Iraq, 1

Afghanistan, Pakistan and Russia.

p “He deﬁnitely showed that he can stand
toe—to—toe with McCain,” he said. “He showed
that he’s not weaker in foreign policy, and they
maintained an even playing ﬁeld with each
other.” _

Warnick said both had “interesting takes on
the bailout situation,” citing that Obama listed
domestic prioiities Versus 'McCain’s interest
in military  She also said the different
stances on military forces in Afghanistan and
the state of Israel showed the different ideas
of each candidate-.

“Their answers were so different on how
the bailout would affect their policies. Qne is
completely focused on the economy here, and
the other continues on with foreign policies,”
she said. I ,

Geiger said that students should pay close
attention to the economic issues at hand.

“‘All of the issues they talked about were
relevant. The state of the economy is really
important to any student who wants to gradu— ,
ate and if have a decent job with retirement,
though,”_she said. “We need to know what’s
 on for the future”

Shuster and \X/arnick agreed that neither
made any large gaffes during the debate, but
they said Obama played nice toward McCain.
However, both pointed to ﬂaws in the candi-
dates’, presentations. '

“McCain seemed very embittered at certain
points. You could see him in the background

looking upset when Obama was speaking. All

his attention was geared towards the modera-

tor when he spoke, too,” he said.

“I think Obama was much more at ease,
and I thought he used the camera well. He
spoke to the people athome, too, not just

_ the moderator. But both seemed too hesi-

tant at times, too afraid to throw a really hard

punch.” .
\Warnick said McCain did not have any “se-

nior moments” and -prepared well for the dis-

cussion, but Obama hesitated too _much and

proved to be “a great speakerbut not a great

debater.”

“My husband kept pointing out that Mc—'

Cain really did his homework, knowing all the
names of countries and their leaders and ev-
erything,” she said. “But I feel like Obama was
way too polite at times.”

\X/arnick also said that the moderating in
the debate was questionable because the time
limits were not enforced.

“McCain went on longer, and Obama was
too nice about it,” she said. “I guess that was
an attempt to be more spontaneous, but I’Ve
been watching debates for about 20 years and

Candidates’ generalizations end in stalemate

time limits were always enforced. That was a
big problem this time around.”

The next presidential debate will be a town
hall meeting held Oct. 7 at Belmont Univer-
sity in Nashville, Tenn. The vice presidential
debate is scheduled for Oct. 2 at \X/ashington
University in St. Louis, Mo.

“I think the next presidential debate will be
Very interesting and probably the most telling,”
said VV/arnick. “It’ll be interesting to see how
each person plans to deal with these domestic
issues, and the Vice presidential debate should
be great, too.” I

Sometimes," musicians find their
inspiration far, far from home
“It started when I heard that the
banjo bad is roots in West Africa,”
said Jayme Stone, who is’ from Boul-
der, Colo., about the motivation be-
hind his recent journey through West
Africa to explore the banjo’s history.
‘‘Ihadbeenlisteningtoalotof

' music from all over Aﬁica, but_par-

,_ticulady thermusic that always kind
of tugged at my heartstiings was th
music from Mali” C '

V In the spring of 2007, Stone spent
three months in Mali  the

banjo’s history, a journey that 
. his new album, titled/iﬁita z‘oA,Dpa-

hrt/Jz'a,'and it also resulted in his col-
laboration on the album with Mansa
Sissoko.

“I was churning all of these ideas
in my mind about how I was going to

 

ere Africa and Appalachia meet  

go about [researching the banjo] ,” said -

Stone “I thought it would be best if I
went to Mali to see where the banjo
comes from, to learn more about the

music and about the predecessors of
the banjo.” In West Aﬁica, explained

I Stone, “they of course don’t call them

banjoes. It’s still a little bit of a mystery
where the name banjo came from.”

There, Stone says the people use
a more popular traditional instrument
called the “ngoni,” which is closely re-
lated to the banjoﬁ The ngoni can have
anywhere from ﬁve to nine stiings It
is different: from the banjo in that it
has a short drone string, which Stone
says adds a more “lego—like ’ to
the music’s sound. V

I Stone’s collaborator on the new al—’
bum, Sissoko,is a griot (a West Aﬁican

poet) ﬁom Mali Also a master player

i of the kora, a 21—st1ing harp, Sissoko

began to direct Stone’s interest toward
the banjo’s West African roots when
they first met four years ago.~Stone

knew on their first meeting that they ’

would share musical collaborations
_ the partnership just seemed to fit
“We started touring and'.spend—
ing time together developing a reper-
toire,” said Stone, “finding different

places to meet and  to enter into
each other’s musical worlds” ,
Stone first heard the banjo at age
16 when he stumbled onto acoustic
music, old—time music and bluegrass
music that used the banjo, which be-
came a point of convergence for his
musical interests
I “I fell in love with the sound of

I the banjo and traditional American '

roots music that had banjo in it,” said
Stone “I heard a fellow named Bela
Fleck play. He is a huge pioneer of
tl.'1ein.st1'ument, and every time he
catne out with a record at the time,
he was playing music no one had ever

‘thought possible on the banjo. I was

Cover band hails

 

of Pop in Station Square

by Marc Schutzbank
Staﬂ’ Wri'[er‘

Michael Jackson has secured his
place in music history as a pop phe-
nomenon, but he's fallen out of the
limelight in recent years.

J On Thursday night, Pittsburgh
saw a resuscitation of the 1982 MJ,

courtesy of the l\/lichael Jackson,

cover band, Who’s Bad. _
Straighfout of Chapel Hill, NC,
Who’s Bad channeled the King of
Pop in its incredible cover of Mi-
chaelJackson. It took the stage at the

Hard Rock Cafe in Station Square, J’
‘‘ Joseph Bell, the lead vocalist, looked“

like Jackson. His hair is curly, and
with a little makeup, you forget that
Michael ever left the stage.

Complete with two fans pufﬁng
up‘ his white dress shirt, Bell moon-
walked across the stage, gyrated his
pelvis and worked it with Vamsi

Tadepalli and Ray McCall on saxo-
phone and trumpet Thankfully, he »

left crotch—grabbing to the original.
Who’s Bad moved through both
time and a costume closet, changing

from the Jackson 5 Michael, with

platform shoes and an Afro, to. the
infamous glove and hat—wearing
“Thriller” Michael. Just like Mike,
Bell spun his way to success, bust-
ing out moves in fo1ir—inch heels
that wowed the audience. The band
put together a medley of Jackson 5

songs that got the audience pumped ‘

up and asking, “Do ya’ll remember
these?” — —
VVh'o's Bad, pagejl-4

Is that Michael Jackson? Well, yes and no. Joseph Bell, native of Chapel I—Iill, N .C.,lgy-rated all over

seven years in a row,
South Side’s Cafe Allegro brings to-
gether two disparate sides of food
culture, the haute couture and the
cozy, to create a restaurant that is both
the main event and a comfortable
background.

I Located just off the neon glow
of East Carson Street, Cafe Allegro’s
black—on—white cursive  glows
cheekily on South 12th Street My
date and I were seated at a table for
‘four in a front room overhung by tree
branches sparkling with white lights

While lovely, the classically dark
corner lit by a small candle made for
an isolated feeling, that did not sit well
with me, having glimpsed the warm

yellow walls and smiling patrons of

the back room. We asked to move.
“That’s where I sit when I have

dimer,” the bartender told us. “I like

' to be near the front of the restaurant,

have some space to spread out I don’t
like to feel crowded.”

' Our  styles differed —— I
prefer the encapsulated feeling of a
table set close to the wall, preferably
near the back of the  room,
where sounds mingle and a collective
buzz settles happily over a good glass
of wine and food that asks for your
time

This is exactly what we found in-

the back room.

Seated close to the activity of the
kitchen, my date and I perused the
menu as we watched its manifesta-
tions waltz past us in the waiters’
steady hands

Cafe Allegro’s seasonal menu pro-
vided some  challenges as
we tried to imagine each item on the
summer 2008 offerings

After several minutes_of debate,
my date and I decided that the bread-

basket, its bounty provided by the Al? I I

a honey walnut pate, would make for
a delightful appetizer. We settled on
the Pasta del Sol as a first course and
an entree of Chef Nolan’s Bouilla—
baisse, but we still struggled with t_he
wine list We ﬁnally laid out our cards
with our waiter. ' ~

We needed a good wine that
would not break our budget to ac-
company the pasta and main course
He solemnly skimmed the list, while
we leaned in closely. A second waiter
joined us.

“What’s going on?” he asked,
smiling. .

“wine consultation,” I said.

“Ah,” he said, “I see.” '

After some discussion, the second
waiter suggested that we try the Pe-
tite Sirah: “a full,  wine that still
has complex notes but is not dry and
acidic, -which is what you wantto stay
away from with the bouillabaisse”
Once we had finally decided, the
waiter whisked away our menus and
allowed us to settle into conversation.

The meal was relaxed but prudent
in its  and the waiters were at-
tentive but not overbea.r1ng' .We sipped
the Sirah, dark and fruity, and awaited

“I have a great love for  a record

and not quite done. We gave it the benefit of the
doubt and enjoyed the lively mix_ of ﬂavors, right
down to dipping a corner of bread into the re-

maining sauce.
Just as the memory of the pasta was 

a steaming platter of Chef Nolan’s Bouillabaisse A

($24) descended, heralded by a change in utensils
It consisted of -two bowls with a small seafood
fork and a  spoon.

Where the pasta  left us doubtful, the
bouillabaisse shored up Cafe Alleg;:o’s claim that
“cuis".ine is a celebrated art.” Cafe A1legro’s rendi-

The entree was more than enough for two

it, leaving room, of course, for dessert. Among

the various options, we decided on the Choco— j

late Tertine ($6.50) and two espressos. While

the espressos lacked the thin layer of “crema,” ,

they served as a solid complement to the dense,
bittersweet Terrine. Accompanied by a 
blackberry and a sliced strawberry, the dessert
was not  _ though rich, it did not shout
“sucrosel” and provided just the right amount of-
chocolate kick between two people '

Satisﬁed, we lingered unmolested over the

album. ‘ _ ' ~
“Repetition is Very much a quality of West
Aﬁican music,” said Stone. “In fact, one of the
things that is a little bit different about our re-
cord is how much more arranged it is. Gener-
ally speaking, West'Afiican music will feature a
repetitive phrase or melody that will cycle for 10
or 15 minutes  some completely unchang-
ing parts, while" other parts may overlap on top
of, that.” I _ a j

ﬂavors, bringing Africa into other areas,~as the
album’s title suggests. ' i
“There’s one piece that sounds almost like
African music gone to Cuba and music that
goes down to the Appalachian mountains,” said

Many eclectic interests inﬂuence Stone’s mu-
sic and take it in diverse directions at any given
moment. Currently, he’s been listening to Span-

ish ﬁddle music, a Swedishifolk rock band called .

Vasen, as well as Bach concertos, which hehas
been playing on the banjo. '

International influences shape Stone's unique jams

This will be Stone’s first time performingii"l

in Pittsburgh, a show that will take the album,
which provides a snapshot of the time at which
it was made, and build upon this moment
through improvisation.

“[Live performance] sort of predates the

world wide we ,” said Stone, “in that you can

play something that’s -500 years old, or play
something that comes ﬂrorn a_ completely differ-

Senior Staﬁ’ Writer

Pitt‘ avoided opening confer-
ence play the way it opened the
season, ducking an upset and beat-
ing Syracuse 34-24 at the Carrier
Dome. Here are some game notes.
from Saturday.

Crossed Up ,4
Not exactly bad news, but
there’s no news about Pitt’s dy-
namic
Greg Cross. After a rousing debut
against Iowa in which Cross scored
a 17-yard touchdown on his first-
ever touch as a Panther, Cross was
a lost man. He didn’t see the ﬁeld
at all against Syracuse on Saturday.
This could mean one of two

things. One, the coaching staff -

doesn’t want to show too much of
Cross before Pitt gets into thebulk

.. of its Big East schedule, or two, it

simply isn’t comfortable enough
yet to use Cross for chunks at
time. i

A Baldwin Sighting

 

junior college transfer-

Pitt’s highly touted freshman
wide receiver- Jonathan Baldwin

ﬁnally got on the stat sheet in his _

fourth game as a’ Panther. Baldwin

made two catches against Syra-

cuse. One was a two—point con-
version that tied the game at 24
in the fourth quarter. Baldwin’s
other catch showed a glimpse of
his play-making ability. Baldwin
caught, a bubble screen, made 21
Syracuse defender miss and nearly
picked up a ﬁrst—down. Pitt con-
verted a fourth-and-short on the

next play.

The coaching staff has been

i trying to ease Baldwin into the

game plan, but both of Baldwin’s
catches were key" plays for Pitt,
and it appears he might be ready

to contribute sooner, rather than ‘

later.

were for 40 yards or more. Lee’s

rushing yards.
McCoy tallied his ﬁrst 100-yard game of
the year, achieving. 149 yards on 28 carries,

' while Stephens-Howling added .71 yards on

13 rushes and two fourth-quarter touch-

downs.

“It was our [offensive] line against their
line, and our line was pushing them down
the ﬁeld the whole time,” said Stephens-
Howling. -

The Pitt offensive line controlled the line
of scrimmage, leading to Pitt’s_control of
the time of possession. The Panthers had
the ball for 38:20. ~

Still, Pitt received quite a scare‘ from the
Orange (1 -4, 0-1 Big East) through the ﬁrst
three quarters. .

Syracuse running back Curtis Brinkley
carried 16 times for 119 yards, and Cameron
Dantley threw for two‘ scores in the‘ losing
effort.

I think the defense knows we need to
. step up at the end of the game

Greg  

Rorneus

On the garne’s ﬁrst- drive, Conor Lee
kicked the ﬁrst of his school-record—tying
four ﬁeld goals. It was a 40—yarder that gave
Pitt the lead. . I

But Mike Holmes returned the ensuing
kickoff untouched for a 90-yard touch-
down, pumping some life into the dormant
Syracuse crowd of 27,549. V

“The thing that ‘happened in the first half

. '[was that] they hit the kickoff return,” said

W/annstedt._“I think that put us on our heels

. a little bit.” ‘ at

Syracuse extended its lead to 14-3 after
Dantley found Donte Davis for a 27-yard
score. ,

Pitt charged back, sconng on its two sec-
ond quarter drives. -Lee kicked a 43-yard ﬁeld

goal, andiDorin Dickerson hauled in a two- _ 

yard score for his ﬁrst career touchdown
catch to cut the deﬁcit to one. _
, The Orange tacked on a ﬁeld goal as time

expired before halftime and put more pres— =
sure on the Panthers on the opening drive

of the second half. _

Holmes broke a second long return, this
time reaching his own 44-yard line.

Five plays later, Dantley lobbed a perfect
pass to freshman‘Van Chew for a 36-yard
touchdown and a 24-13 lead.

Lee kicked a 44-yard ﬁeld goal on Pitt’s
next drive to cut it to 24-16. The following
drive swayed the momentum in Pitt’s favor

\

for good.

Panther freshman receiver Jonathan
Baldwin made his ﬁrst career catch on a
screen pass, setting up a crucial fourth-and-
one. Quarterback Bill Stull ran a sneak up
the middle to earn a new set of downs. ‘

McCoy ﬁnally broke loose, running
down the sidelines for a 34-yard gain. Pitt
then went to Stephens-Howling, who ran 20
yards on the ﬁrst "play of the fourth quarter
and added a nine-yard touchdown on the
next play.

Wannstedt chose to go for the two-point— '

conversion to tie the game. Stull threw a
shaky lob to Baldwin in the end zone, but he
pulled it down to make it 24-24. A

The defense held again, and Lee notched

his fourth straight ﬁeld goal, this one from
25 yards out, to give Pitt its ﬁrst lead since
early in the ﬁrst quarter.

On the ensuing drive, defensive end
Greg Romeus broke into the backﬁeld and
sacked Dantley, forcing a fumble. \With' the
ball tumbling on the turf, jabaal Sheard leapt
over a fallen offensive lineman and pounced
on it 0

“I think the defense knows we need
to step up at the end of the game,” said
Romeus.’ “\X/e put that on our shoulders.
[Syracuse] was making big plays all game.
Everybody on the defensive line made plays
at the end of the game.” e

The Panthers ran the ball eight straight
plays after the fumble, and Stephens—Howl-

ling put the game away with a three—yard

touchdown run.

Pitt has a short week and will face No. 0
