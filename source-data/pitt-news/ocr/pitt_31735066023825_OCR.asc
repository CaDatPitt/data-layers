Inflation is the “real culprit” for
next year’s tuition hike, said Jack
Freeman, senior vice chancellor, as
he detailed circumstances surround-
ing the expected tuition hike.

Freeman, whose office is in charge
of supervising Pi-tt’s budget, cited *
increases in salaries for faculty and
staff as the biggest cost increases
associated with the budget.

“That is the increase that we have
to provide in order to continue to
attract outstanding people.” Free-
man said. 9

Freeman emphasized that none of
the budgetary increases contributing
to the hike are “programmatically
related,” or for the purpose of creat-
ing new programs or schools that
“chew up a lot of dollars.” 4

Other large budgetary increases-
include taxes such as social security,
and other “formula-based” costs
,, such as insurance_ and unemploy-

ment compensation. ‘

The major affect of inflation on
Pitt is,eas Chancellor Wesley Posvar
said in a Tuesday interview, ailess

appropriations.

While a majority of students

Pitt’s academic integrity guidelines
discourage professors‘ from impos-
ing strict penalties on students who
cheat in the classroom, according to
a Pitt faculty member.

English professor Michael West.
voiced this opinion at last Friday’s
Office of Faculty Development
seminar, “Crime in the classroom:
Academic Honesty and Disho-
nesty.” Also participating were Ray
Steele, assistantvprovost, and Alden
Bowen, director ofthe Office of Spe-
cial Student Services.

Steele and Bowen were among
those involved in the drafting of the
original academi’c‘integrity guide-
lines in 1974. Under the guidelines, a
student who believes he has been
unfairly accused of cheating can!
challenge the charge before a
student-faculty hearing board. After
hearing the case, the board makes

recommendations to the dean of the .-

Assembly, Pitt will receive
$74,553,000 in appropriations. a 4.9
percent increase over last year’s ’
appropriation of $7l,06_9.000.

When broken down into five cate-
gories, Pitt would receive
$66,4l0,000. for general education, a
5.5 percent increase over last year;
$2,960,000 in student aid, at zero per-
cent increase; $4,083,000 for the
medical school, an increase of
$22,000 over last year; and no.
increases for the dental clinic or
Titusville campus which would
receive $600,000 and $500,000
respectively.

James Stevenson, supervising
analyst for the education unit of the
state office of budget analysis, said a
tuition hike at Pitt was anticipated
by his office in their budget recom-
mendation to the governor.

“I think that that(the tuition hike)
was’ probably an underlying consid-
eration,” Stevenson sa-id.

“If we had more we would recom-
mend more,” Stevenson said, “but
we just don’t have it.”

Specific cost-cutting measures to
be enacted by the university will cen-
ter in the area of “custodial services
and physical plant maintenance,"
Freeman said.

Other “budgetary ‘reductions’
include “secretarial and administra-

Jan. 29. .
In addition, Daniel May, associ-
ate director of student aid,

presented a report _on ﬁnancial aid _

and “No Need Scholarships.”
The visitation policy survey
polled 81 Resident Assistants, 65
resident students, 15 m/embersof
the Resident Student Association

‘ and 92 desk ‘attendants last term.

When the students were asked how
they would revise the policy, 23
percent of the undergraduates
voted to allow overnight guests of

school involved. The dean can con‘-
cur with the board or reach an inde-
pendent decision.

If the student is still unsatisfied, he.
can appeal to the University Review
Board, which will examine the case
to make sure proper procedure was

followed. This board makes recom- .

mendations tothe Office of the Pro-
vost, which will make the final
decision. » - ' -. . ’
West said some teachers are lax
on cheating, with a “what can I do
about it?" attitude. But he said he
understands the reluctance of some
teachers to initiate a charge of cheat-
ing which could later be challenged

before a hearing board. West’_s expe- V
rience with ‘the hearing boards has _

left him ‘feeling “awkward” about
dealing with them. He said some

provisions ofthe academic integrity-

guidelines hamper teachers wishing
to give strict penalties for cheating,
while doing nothing to discou_rage
teachers from being too lenient.
Bowen said his responsibility is to _

\

tive support services,” a reduction in

- travel by university personnel, and

supplies and equipment.
‘Freeman. said administrative.
activities have been more dramati-

either sexwith roommate approval.
One-third of theikstudents polled
said that they were occasionally
inconvenienced by‘ the policy, and
two-thirds of the students saidithat
they ‘were offended bygit; However,
one-half of those affected didnot

feelingsjmown, according to ' Dr.
Kimbo. I ’ i '

see" “that students are protected” but

_ is sympathetic to faculty and admi-

nistrative concerns about’ cheating.
He added that the-guidelines are

. “great on paper” but suffer “innu-

merable problems” in actual prac-'

tice. Despite~the shortcomings, he 9

defended the system, believing that
the “benefits of academic processes
,are_worth the trouble." \
According to Steele, the guide-
lines have-accomplished a favorable
purpose in stemming outside court
cases involving academic integrity.
“Courts are a very dissatisfying
solution," Steele said “Since the
guidelines were issued there have
been'no outside legalisuits involving
academic integrity.”

West said the appeals process of
the system “unclermines" teachers
who wish to give severe penalties for
cheating. He told of acase where his
penalty (failure in the course) was
reduced by a, hearing board, even

room for improvement in the
policy, which. will be discussed
further when the board of trustees

VA snack bar seating 400 people, a
large multi-purpose room for
banquets and presentations, and

many ‘other additions are part of

the renovation plans for Pitt's
Schenley Hall. D

Andrew Smith Jr., director of
student activities stated that
although the exact date of the
ground breaking is not ﬁnal, it
should take place sometime during
the summer months.

There are many new changes
planned for the student union. The
most interesting, however, accord-
ing to Smith, will be an atrium
located adjacent on the main
building ﬂoor. ,

“Another interesting aspect will
be that there will be nine ﬂoors of a

student union, with the rest of the

ﬂoors being ofﬁce space,” Smith
said.

What will happen to the existing
groups that use ofﬁce space in the
building at this moment?

Two clinical psychologists, Dr.
Kevin L. Bowman and Dr. Stan
Perelman, were appointed to the

‘ University of Pittsburgh's Counsel-

ing Center on Dec. 1, 1980.

Both men are here to work with

students, staff, anf faculty in need
of some direction with emotional
problems they are having difficulty
coping with. '

the counseling center, located at

course, not be permanent as the
newspaper will be relocated into
their new ofﬁce in a year or so,”
Smith said. ~

Senior Vice Chancellor for
Administration Jack Freeman ex-
plained costs and funding for the
renovations.

“The project‘ as it presently
stands will cost around $1 million,”
Freeman said. “We won't know
exactly until the actual prices and
ﬁnal plans are in.”

The funds for the renovation will
come from two sources, according
to Freeman.

The majority of the funding,
approximately seven million dol-
lars, will come from the students
through an increase in tuition.,This
increase will be on a credit-hour
basis. , .

“It’ll be something like two
dollars per credit,” Freeman said.
“For example, a full time student
taking 15 credits might pay $30,
wheras a part-time, three-credit

student would only pay six

dollars.”

Prior to working at Pitt, Bowman

said he decided to come to Pitt

because he was attracted to the

the fee until after the building is in
operation b ecause it’s not fair to
charge students for a facility they
may not be around to use,”
Freeman added.

A mortgage will cover the pay-
ments until the building is paid off
by students over a period of
approximately 30 years.

“Typical student union fees’ in
other universities range from $20
to. $60 a term,” Freeman said.
“This is not unusual," but a normal
way of paying off a student union.’ ’

The other four million dollars will
hopefully be raised through what
Freeman calls, the “capital cam-
paign.” '

"‘We are now in the midst of a
$15 million capital campaign,”
explained Freeman. “We are
asking that four million dollars of
that money be used for student
union renovation in order to lower
the student union fee.”

These capital funds will consist
of contributions from private
donors such as alumni and friends
of the university. _

raised so far torenovate Schenley

“It provides professional stimu-
lation and insures you are always

of the counseling staff and has an
ofﬁce in the Student Health Center,

Gene Roddenberry, creator and

'_‘=‘-executive producer of the Star Trek

television series and motion pic-
ture,appeared at Pitt Tuesday
night.

Roddenberry announced that a
new two-hour movie has been
ordered to appear’ either on
television or in the theaters.
According to Roddenberry, the
story is in the process of being
written and Paramount studios will

. decide whether to make it a full

length movie or a periodical 90
minute-to-two-hour television ver-

If this new Star Trek goes the
television route, it would most
likely run-about every 10-12 weeks,
instead of as a weekly series. A
weekly Star Trek would take too
much time to put out for the actors
involved, -according. to Rodden-
berry. .

The present movie, “Star Trek,
the Motion Picture,” took about
ﬁve years to make. After" the

V. television series was cancelled,

. ‘fl

Roddenberry created the two-hour ‘

movie version, but Paramount was
not very interested. ‘

‘ A’ used the

Then Star Wars was released
and was a huge success. Thus,
Paramount let Roddenberry con-
tinue his project as it became
apparent to Paramount that science
fiction was in, according to
Roddenberry.

But when the movie went into
production, it was on an extremely
tight schedule, so tight that there
was not even time for a preview to
find some of the mistakes.

According to Roddenberry, he

was not in “full creative control”
as he had been during the T.V.
series. He would have liked to have
secondary characters
more than they were. He wanted
the ﬁlm to be a “happening” and

an “emotional experience.”

The program opened with a
16-minute ﬁlm’ of the Star’ Trek
bloopers; out-takes, , from the
television series that never made it
on the air.‘ '

There were many scenes where
the cast was acting silly, having
trouble remembering their lines,
playing on their own mistakes ‘and
innocently causing the other actors
to l_augh.

There were times when the doors

a field of stars. They tried to keep

theiscene going but ended up in-

hysteria;
There were two other ﬁlms that
Roddenberry brought along for the

audience to view. One was a.

‘backstage look at the production of
the Star Trek movie. The other was
a film called “Spaceborne,”
sponsored by NASA and actually
filmed in space with no special
effects.

Roddenberry spoke about the old
television series and mentioned
that he was proud of the major
themes of the show. First, that
there was always respect for life
forms different than human.

Crime In The Classroom-conumu~»mr«geo»e-

“We don’t want the courts of the
state of Pennsylvania to visit class-

rooms and pass judgment" where it

is more appropriate for the Univer-
sity to do so, Steele said.

However, West criticized loop-
holes in the guidelines that make it
easy to cheat. For example, in a
course taken for a Credit/No Entry
grade, a student cannot be given an
“F” for cheating, West said.

Bowen defended the reducing of
,teacher authority by relating how

some
could not back up their charges
before a hearing board.

As for the problems in implemen-
tation of the guidelines. Bowen
explained that the University “has
not yet found an effective way to put
these guidelines into practice. If
faculty are unfamiliar with their
role, the system will forever have
shortcomings. lf the system is to
work, then faculty members must
make a concerted effort to under-
stand their role. Weak points...occur

“well-intentioned teachers"

because of faculty unpreparedness.
Participants should be sensitized to
their roles."

Bowen said it is crucial for
teachers to inform students “up
front" about their individual stand-
ards on cheating.

Steele mentioned other areas
where the guidelines apply. They can
be used by students to seek redress
against a teacher for infractions such
as frequent absences, late grade
reports, etc. The guidelines also ena-
ble students or faculty to deal with

the problem of class disruption.

Another area where students can
seek redress is teacher “incompe-
tence”; for example, when a teacher
has trouble speaking English.

Steele said he is pleased that the
system has worked in giving Pitt an
“in-house” way to solve academic
integrity issues.

the state’s Board of Education deci-
sion not to recommend specific
appropriations for state and state-
related institutions.

Legislative Act 224 of 1972 pro-
vides that the board recommend
appropriations before the governor
submits his annual budget to the
General Assembly. But this year, the
board recommended that the “first
priority for allocatingany new funds
for higher education" be directed
into the Pennsylvania Higher Edu-

-._cation Assistance Act (PHEAA),
according to a January 8 statement
from the board.

Scanlon said the board’s intent-

.was to “take a look at the priorities
of the dollars.”

“The situation is sobad in the
state, the revenue picture is so bleak
that they (the board) didn’t-want to
be unrealistic...they‘d rather be
more realistic and they want to be
more in line in supporting the gover-
nor,” Scanlon said.

The board “prioritized their
recommendation” Scanlon said.

INCAR is more than welcome to voice its opposi-
tion to sociobiology. But INCAR has overstepped its
boundaries in calling for the teaching of sociobiology
to cease. . 7 V

‘‘I think thatthe Committee Against Racism--if they
believe .sociobiology is wrong--should criticize’ it,’we
who teach it, its ideas, but not ever question its right to
be studied,” associate professor of Foundations of
Education David Cambell said.

Cambell directly refuted INCAR’s claims.

“This particular attack on sociobiology is wrong-
absolutely mistak«en—-in every assertion made regard-
ing sociobiology, but quite correct in the charge of
racists using sociobiology to promote their own sort of
hate, fear and frustration, and demonstrate their near

‘ total ignorance,” Cambell said.’ V
Determining the validity of either argument is irrele- _

vant; at stake in this issue is academic freedom.
INCAR, by its attempts to prevent sociobiology
from being taught at Pitt, is removing one of our
freedoms--whether or not to study sociobiology.
Pitt students deserve the right to be exposed to
sociobiology and to determine its validity for
themselves. _ .

Sociobiology-’Peop|eWho Know BetterCanBeWonTo It’

Dear Editor:

When someone told me Dr. David
Campbell was teaching sociobiology
I said, “No, you must have sociobi-
ology confused -with something
else." I have known Dave for years
and have known him to be a strong
anti-racist and anti-sexist. So l was
disappointed to see his letter defend-
ing sociobiology in the Jan. 21 Pitt
News. His letter didn't make me
think any more of sociobiology.
Rather, it made sociobiology seem
more insidious because people who
should know better can be won to it.

I want to deal with three basic
points Dave Campbell made: his

Dear Editor:

In the Jan. 2|. issue of The Pitt
News a professor defended sociobi-
ology. I will not debatewhether or
not sociobiology merits study, but I
do take exception to several state-
ments made in his letter.

He states that evolution is fact.
Can he prove it? 1 do not think he
can. Where are the results from
actual experiments made to validate

V the methods used ‘to date fossils?

Even in the book, “The Selﬁsh

defense of sociobiology as true; his
civil libertarian argument that socio-
biology must be allowed to exist
even‘. if everything INCAR ’(the
International Committee Against
Racism) says about it is true; and his
cynicism.

First of all, it is aboslutely true
that sociobiologists say that behav-
ior is primarily controlled by genes.
The quote in our leaﬂet,fr’om Daw-
kins‘ book “The Selﬁsh Gene" said
that humans are just “lumbering
robots” controlled by genes. Daw-
kins spends most of his book trying
to prove that the genes that would
tend to survive would be genes for
things like deceit, male promiscuity,
exploitation of female by male, the
ability of a female to pick a male

who will give good genes to her
offspring. This is the book used in
‘the Pitt anthropology course. Socio-
biologists also do say that racism
and patriotism are partially genetic:
“Like all sociobiologists, the
authors think genes play a hitherto
unsuspected role in much human
behavior. Examples: Fear_ of
strangers. Som'e sociobiologists
think such fear is a bu-ilt-in mecha-
nism that helps explain patriotism
and 'even racism.” (This quote was
taken from’ Time magazine, Jan 26,

I981 in an article about a new, book l

_ by E.O. Wilson, the father of the
news sociobiology. and Charles
Lumsden). '

Mind To f

Of Other Theories

ls it possible that this professor
believes evolution so fervently that
he has closed his mind to other the-
ories? I think he has, and I remind
him of his own warning against this.
His attack on the _“religious" pers-
pective as only a possibility for the
“very ignorant“ shows this clearly. I
know of some very_educated people
who held similar opinions before
-.they studied the biblical perspective.
These people, however, did not close
their mind to investigating alternate
possibilities by studying
creationism. ' ‘ .

how like animals humans are: child-

animals. There are quantitative dif- -

developing the ability to glide longer

Dear Editor:

For the part of the past decade,
the University of Pittsburgh has
been held hostage by the Pennsyl-
vania Legislature. Whenever a?
budget crunch arose, the Gover-
nor’s idea was to motivate the
-considerable human and ﬁnancial
resources of the university to push
the legislature to ‘accepting tax
increases. Pitt and . the r other
state-related institutions would
then pressure individual legislators
to do their duty for higher

‘education. This unfortunate scen-

ario will continue to- be a way of life
as long as the General Assembly’s
current policy of nonpreferred
appropriation remains in force.

It is a fact of life that taxpayers
are no longer willing to accept an
additional burden. It is also a fact
of life that schools like Pitt are
increasingly dependent on state
money. This conflict puts a
tremendous pressure on individual
legislators. For example, I am a
ﬁrm believer in higher education
and a Pitt alumni, yet my
constituents would be up in arms if
they perceived that I supported a

plan for them to pay additional tax
dollars to support the University of
Pittsburgh or any other institution
of higher learning.

I feel that what must be done is
to make the appropriations for Pitt
and the other state-related univer-
sities a part of the General Fund. It
is an umproper assumption for the
general public to believe that its tax
burden is being increased solely for
the beneﬁt of Pitt, but, the
nonpreferred process makes such a
presumption inevitable.

My suggestion for the students,

The New Drug Paraphernalia Law:

BanningG|

l’ve been hearing ai'lot of state-
ments around this university con-
cerning certain law going into effect
banning the sale of drug parapher-
nalia. Most of the talk has been neg-
ative and I think it’s about time
another viewpoint was heard and
another voice seen. Gov. Thorn-
burgh and the Sta}e Legislature have
come up with a most ingenious plan
for eradicating the use of narcotics
that are not only illegal, but worse

still, not manufactured by Amerﬁan '

drug companies. I applaud the

efforts of ourgovernment. After all, .

when so much time and money fails

to eliminate the drugs in question, ”

something must’ be done. In their
desperation, our outstanding legis-
lators have come up "with a solution
no normal person would have
thought of. Necessity is the mother
of invention. What impeccable
logic-- if you can’t get rid ofthe drug,
get rid ofthe means used to consume
it. Hats off to you, Harrisburg!

However, I fear our bureaucrats
may not realize the true potential for
law enforcement that their scheme
represents. I have a few thoughts on

Sociobiology

‘Favoritism toward real or putative

to take it for granted. Somemodern
industrial societies, and a few agrar-
ian societies like Imperial China,
have attempted to combat various
forms of particularism, such as
racism, and ethnic or caste preju-
dice, and have tried to institutional-
ize impersonal norms of
universalism in their bureaucratic
organizations, but nearly all such
attempts have been insidiously and
systematically subverted from
within. Nepotism triumphs in the
end, and ‘most societies have been
realistic enough not to try to stamp it
out.”

  Iran: Statements Are Not he

By CHRIS CLINTON

I remember when Iwas a_ child
and one of my younger siblings
would hit me. As I prepared to
strike back,._ my mother would
constantly say, “Don’t hit him
back, he’s younger than you and

you should know better.” I can

remember the anger and frustra-
tion I felt because I could not hit
back.

Reading the accounts of the 52
Americans that were held hostage
in Iran, I experienced the same
anger and frustration as when I was

a child. The abuses inﬂicted upon‘
our fellow Americans was a blow to

the whole country. Although the
“students” claim it was a battle
between governments, 52 innocent
people were used as scapegoats.

score of 60-53 at the Field House '
Wednesday night.

The ﬁrst half was low scoring.
not because the defenses were
particularly great. There were just
missed opportunities by botlrteams
throughout.

The first points of the game were

. scored by Duquesne, but not until

two and a half minutes had
elapsed. The Dukes eventually took
a 3-0 lead "before Pitt lit up the

‘scoreboard over a minute later.

It was a game that was fought
mainly underneath the boards. The
war was waged between Pitt's Sam
Clancy and Duquesne’s Bruce
Atkins and John Moore. In what
could be considered a draw, Clancy
ﬁnished the game with 20 points
and 10 rebounds before fouling out
with 1:10 left in the game. Atkins
made his presence felt with 15
points and 15 rebounds while
Moore added 18 points and ﬁve
rebounds despite early foul trou-
ble. 1

Dwayne Wallace played an o

important role for the Panthers by
being the man who started Pitt's
fastbreak with key assists and
clutch shots from the top of the key.

The first half of play ended with
the Panthers leading by three,
25-22, after a tight fisted,
nose-to-nose battle in which each
team scratched and clawed for each
inch of space on the court.

The beginning of the second half
was probably the main .cause for
the Dukes defeat. Pitt opened up a
10 point lead, 39-29, due to a 10-2
spurt with about l5 minutes left to
play. '

Package

 

  

  
  

By JOHNETTE HOWARD

Pltt News Sports Writer

Pitt basketball head coach Roy Chipman doesn’t
like it or understand how it cduld happen. Don
Steiner, public relations director for the Eastern 8, said
it shouldn't have happened.

“We deserve to get blasted," said Steiner. “It caused
somewhat of a crisis.”

“It 1’ is the recent mid-season cancellation of the
Eastern 8 television package, which broadcasted select
league basketball games over a l0—station network.
The loss was blamed on a “lack of sponsorship” and

_“verbal commitments which didn't come through" by

' league commissioner Leland Byrd. The Mizlou Tele-
 vision Network, which was in charge of producing and
I . _ . .
selling the plan, said it was unable to sell enough

advertising to cover the $20,000 cost of the weekly
telecasts. '

Under the terijisbf the package, the burden of finan-
ciallosses restecfljtith the Eastern 8 and its institutions,
and not the Mizlou company. The league never went
directly to its member schools for funds to retain the
package, but opted instead to cancel the coverage.

‘‘I don’t know how it happened or why the contract

was negotiated that way," said Chipman. “It seems to

. me that if you award the package to a network, it

should be up to them to sell advertising and assume the
losses if they don’t.” '

“Other leagues, like the Big East, have had the same’

‘ advertising problems, but the television companies

were responsible for the losses,” said Chipman. “It
gives-' the league better control. In our situation,'the

 'burden of loss was on the institutions.”

The loss of the television package. seems to bea leap

 .« 4-, backward for_a league struggling to gain national pres-
 tige and compete with its better known neighbors like ,

       

the Big East and Metro Tconferences.

For a Pitt basketball program in transition under
first-year head coach Chipman and hovering around
the .500 mark most of the season, the loss creates even
more problems. , . M ’

“Losing the television package hurts. It can create a
snowballing effect,” said Chipman. “It hurts the status
of the league. It makes it more difficult for everybody
to bring good players into the league: which hurts the
quality of the league ‘itself. And it just adds to our
difficulty in recruiting."

With the graduation of Panther mainstays Sam
Clancy, Carlton Neverson and Lennie McMillian this

year, recruiting for next year assumes an added signiﬁ- '

cance for Chipman. ~

, . Chipman said he hopes something can be done to

revive the league’s package for next season, but in the

meantime Pitt is investigating the possibility of work-

ing on its own television plan for next year.

According to Dean Billick, Pitt's director of sports
information, any Pitt television plan would be on a
limited basis of perhaps five or six games, and would
most likely be confined to the Pittsburgh area and not
a network of stations. The contract for the package, if
formed, is not required to go to WTAE, which broad-
casts the radio coverage of Pitt basketball, but rather
could go to any station in the Pittsburgh market.

“Television is important to our program and _we
plan to do someinvestigative work. in late spring for
our own package,” said Billick. “We’ll be looking for
sponsorships and trying to get something to work.

Any package will require in excess of S I 5,000 per game _

to televise so we have to be careful.”

League members Rutgers, Rhode Island,‘ and West
Virginia’ already have their own statewide networks
and, ‘since the loss-of the league's plan, Rhode-Island

and West Virginia have:-«opted to add_ a. few. ‘more. .
telecasts .to their coverage.. Pitt‘ l1as,_tried-'_te_l_ecasts ’

   

i~i:°f "3

games on a limited basis in the past with some success, .

' said Billick, but it i_s too late to arrange to televise any

games this season.

The Eastern 8 still plans to televise the final game of
the championship tournament from the Civic Arena
on March 7, but has scrapped the ‘possibility of any
regular-season game coverage again this year, as Byrd

5 had mentioned in a press conference when the package

was cancelled. . \

The five-year history of the league and its atiempts
to get televised coverage on the air is dominated by
difficulties and setbacks. ' ‘ '

Four years ago, TCS Productions televised the
league finals from Philadelphia, and was awarded the
contract for the following season. TCS backed out of
the contract at the last minute before the season began,
leaving the league with no televised coverage at all that
year;

Last year, Dudley Freeman, an independent pro- .
ducer, was‘contracted by the Eastern 8, but the tele- .

casts were produced poorly and announcers were
changed. on virtually a weekly basis. In some cities,’
stations elected to show the games on a delay basis.

“We were extremely displeased withthe quality of
the production and most of station clearancesla-st
year, which were very poor,” said Steiner. ‘.‘It was
ridiculous.” « 1 -

This season, Freeman sub-contracted the package
to Mizlou, and although the league was pleased with
the station outlets and improved production, Steiner
said Mizlou didn’t deliver what, they had promised,
and as a result the coverage was axed.

“lt’s basically their fault. Mizlou acquired the con-
tract last May. ‘I'm not sure they started on it imme-
diately, but they had ample time .-to arrange“ for\
sponsors,” saidfSteiner. :Their' approach just-_ didn’t»'

Eastern 8

(Continued from page 10)

In the Eastern 8 press guide written before the sea-
son, Byrd said, “Ifthe league is to serve as a showcase
for college basketball, this television package must
remain as one of its key vehicles,” and that “the growth
of the network is important to the Eastern 8‘s overall
growth.” Byrd also cited the development ofa network
as a primary objective when the league was founded.

Steiner agreed that in the league’s haste to fulfill this
objective and project a good public image, it may have
sacrificed precautionary measures, and extensive
planning.

“We were trying to get it on the air—pe‘riod,” said
Steiner, “There was not an overwhelming demand for
people to do the telecasts, and there was only one
group (Mizlou) involved. If 10 companies had bid on
the product, we might have been guaranteed coverage
up front.”

According to Steiner, the contract with Mizlou was
an “informal one” and not a “high—priced, lawyer-
written deal.” Steiner characterized the deal as a
“cooperative effort,” with the Eastern 8 handling the
minor details, the scheduling of games, and encourag-
ing sponsors that the product was what Mizlou said it
was. The league did nottake an active part in actually
selling advertising, which was left to Mizlou to handle.

“The crux of the matter is sales, and they (Mizlou)
simply didn’t do what they said they would,” s_aid
Steiner. “They tried to tie the advertising for our bas-

ketball package in with some of the bowl games they
televise and offer it to the sponsors that way, but it
obviously didn't work.”

Byrd, at the news conference to announce the sud-
den cancellation, said that “verbal commitments from
prospective sponsors didn’t come through ” for this
year’s package. ‘

“There was no guarantee,” said. Steiner, “and prom-
ises don't hold up when you’re going to the bank.”

Steiner said that after the March 7 finals, the league
will re—evaluate the television coverage and begin plans
for next year's coverage.

“Any agreement from now on will require a guaran-
tee upfront, with no changes, no cuts, and no cancella-

tions,” said Steiner.

“Next time, the Eastern 8 will assume a different

approach--we plan to be directly involved from the

word go, and take more control. This has caused
somewhat of a crisis,» but we've been extremely suc-
cessful at surviving those before.

“We can’t afford it any more.”
