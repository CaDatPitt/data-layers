VISTA Hosts Two
UniVersityStudents

Two University students, Michael Marcuse and Marcia
McNutt, and Frank Watanabe, executive director of the
University YMCA, attended a conference of Volunteers in
Service in America (VISTA) this past weekend at Alice
Lloyd Junior College in Kentucky. ’ ‘

Alice Lloyd Junior College is located in Pippa Passes,

Kentucky, an area included in the section of the country
known as Appalachia. The conference, which included ﬁeld
trips through various counties in eastern Kentucky, ‘was
designed to dramatize the problems that exist in the ﬁelds

of health and education.

Participating in an education
ﬁeld trip, Miss McNutt traveled
to Upper Holler, a creek-bed area
with settlements sparsely dlStI'1~
buted along the roads. Comment-
ing on her trip Miss McNutt re-
marked, “There’s no such thing
as a community. The houses are
spread along in random fashion,
and if there’s enough ﬂat land,
four or ﬁve houses will have
been built.”

Miss McNutt was most impress-
ed by the “tremendous feeling’ of
isolation. There are no tele-
phones. People have to walk six
miles to the post office if they
want to make a phone call.”

Marcuse, traveling to the city

_, of Hazard, a coal-mining com-

munity, considered “the tremen-
dous dependence inbred in gen-
erations of people by the socio-
economic system under which
these people have lived,” the
most striking aspect of his visit.

The conclusion reached by
Watanabe, who visited a rural

, area, was that “VISTA volun-

teers permit these people to help
themselves” and improve their
own conditions.

In Appalachia, most VISTA
volunteers work in community
redevelopment programs. Their
contributions in these areas in-
clude day-care centers in Indian
reservations, assisting the mig-
rant workers in Southern Cali-
fornia by establishing adult edu-
cation classes and literacy class-
es, and working in urban slums
to improve their conditions. They
go anywhere help is needed,”
Marcuse emphasized.

Miss McNutt expressed the
need for VISTA volunteers, es-

pecially in the Appalachia area,

 

when she described the people
she had seen: “The most pre-

dominant mood of the commun-V .

ity is a feeling of hopelessness,

which is reﬂected in the faces of '

the people, .and in theirway of
living. The impoverished com-
fmunities of Appalachia are a re-
sult of living lives that have
been stagnant for so long and- of
being entrenched in the com-
munity‘s hoplessness.” A

Miss Judith Welles, VISTA ﬁeld
coordinator, will be at the Uni-
versity today and tomorrow.
Those interested in further infor-
mation may contact Mr. Wat-
anabe in 518 .SU. Information
booths will be open today and
tomorrow in the Student Union,
from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., and in
the lobby of the Towers, from 3
to 8 p.m. ~

University Plans Program
On Management Technique

A two-day conference on a new management technique,
originally developed in the Polaris missile program, will be
conducted at the University, April 12 and 13.

The new technique, called “PERT” for Program Eval-
uation and Review Technique, is a systematic method of
devising a program, checking the logic of it, and keeping
track of it in operation. Used in military and industrial op-

erations, PERT is now being in-
troduced into the ﬁeld of educa-
tion.
The program is considered
most useful in “once through”
projects with complex interde-
pendent functions rather than
routine p rodu c t i o 11 activities;
projects in which the time and
nature of the tasks needed for
completion are uncertain; and
projects which must_ meet a
schedule despite these limitations.

ty grey-brown. The land was de-
bris covered grey-brown. The
faces of the children, too, were
grey-brown as they played in the
garbage thrown aimlessly from
the windows of their shanties.

Abandoned cars lined the high-
way with parts crudely displayed
in the middle of the creeks. Some
of the cars were only partially
abandoned; they served as a
more elegant form of outhouse.
In a moment of collective ingen-
uity, the destitute families placed
planks of unpainted wood taken
from their backyards across nar-
row creeks .and drove or pushed
these cars onto them. Then, after
cutting a hole in the ﬂoor of the
car, each family could move out
of the old shack and into an out-
house where the running stream
provided ﬂushing water. We be-
gan to feel less like talking, and
the bus fell silent as we looked
in amazement on conditions we
thought the TV documentaries
had exaggerated for dramatic ef-
fect. Disgusted self-consciousness
set in.

On Saturday I took a ﬁeld trip
with Guerney Nelson, the liberal
editor of the Hazard Herald. We
drove through Perry County and
saw the old mining communities
in the hollows. Driving through
six-inch mud we traveled the
narrow roads back from the high-
ways and saw the communities
abandoned except for the people
who still made their homes in
the shacks.

THE DEEP mining which em~ -

played the men who now. re-
ceive their "family’s food” from
the government food-stamp sub-
sistence program is now com-
pletely automatic. Some of the
men work in strip and augur
mining on the tops of mountains
above their hollows. Thankful for

sons who took the Peace Corps
exam are invited to attend.

A uftheastem Kentucky 

"The Face of Poverty

 By Michael Marcuse

not having to sit at home doing
nothing, they have the unique
pleasure of pushing the dirt oi?
the mountain-tops and into their
towns to expose the open veins
of coal. The dirt renders the soil
completely useless and manages
to destory many of the already
dilapidated huts. It also -makes
gardens impossible, but, then
again, it covers up one layer of
garbage rather well.

The dirt adds to the grey-
brown color which seemed to
transfer‘ even more ‘readily to
the faces of the men as they sat
in the late afternoon watching
their children growing up in ﬁlth
and in the dirt they had pushed
down into the hollows to make
enough money to buy the food
stamps.

Coming‘ back from Pippa Pass-
es, I began trying to solidify some
of my impressions of the week-
end. VISTA people seemed to feel
that the real problem was wheth-
er Volunteers could even make a
dent in the generations of pov-
erty, carelessness, and despair
which created the cyclic prob-

lems of Eastern Kentucky. Yet, I A

tried to tell myself, as so many

of us have, that the people were- I
n’t really doing enough them-

selves. They still sold their votes
to the» county politicians who

would do nothing. They still I
threw the garbage out their win- I

dows. They still didn’t bother to
ﬁnd out about birth-control meth-
ods. They still allowed their chil-
dren to drink from the polluted
streams and creeks and they
didn’t demand responsible» gov-
ernment by electing county judges
who had at least ﬁnished high
school.

THEIR OWN inaction 

brought this blight upon them,
and they could suffer for it. They
had become too dependent the
day they “sold their soul to the
company store.” The paternalism

‘of the coal companies had left
the mines and the hollows, but =

the children never grew up. I

’ wondered whether VISTA could

help them grow, and yet I knew

that the old excuses for looking .

theother way also wouldn't help.

Coming back on the bus to
Lexington ‘ the colors changed
gradually back to ‘green and

white and the busload of stu- ,
dents grew more animated. We 1

boarded our dinner-flight out of
Kentucky and sat back in our
chairs to enjoy our ﬁrst full meal
of the weekend. As I sat smok-

‘ ing a cigarette after dinner I

glanced at' the left-overs on
everyone’s tray. A feeling of rose-
colored nausea came over me as
I quietly looked at my folded
and silent hands. '

Equal Time
Rabbi Richard L. Ruben-
stein, a University chaplain,
demanded equal time on the
“Today Show,” an NBC televi-
sion program, to refute the state-
ments made about him by Ala-
b,ama Governor George Wallace
last Thursday.
In a statement issued Thurs-
day, Rabbi Rubenstein said that
he deeply resented Governor Wal-

lace’s “misuse” of the Rabbi’s
statement.
Said Rabbi Rubenstein, “the

devil can quote scripture to his
own purpose. The majestic march
of the Civil Rights movement to
ﬁnal victory cannot be deterred
by an irresponsible governor who
fails to discharge the duties of
his office to all citizens of his
state.” i e

FRED MAZUREK
Baseball MVP

Football linebacker Marty

Schottenheimer last night.

was named the winner of
the annual Pitt News award
at the All-Sports banquet in
the Student Union Ballroom.
The award is annually given
to the senior athlete who has
most distinguished himself
on the ﬁeld of play.
Schottenheimer was nominated
for award along with Bill Del-
Vecchio, Lee Hall, Fred Mazurek,
Andy McGr.aw, and Daryle Ruby.
Schottenheimer was the winner
by a large margin with Mazurek

coming in second.

A board of 13 journalists se-

lected Schottenheimer as the win-
ner. The panel included Bill Cab-
in, Marvin Zelkowitz "of The Pitt
News; Bob Smizik of Pittsburgh
Weekly Sports; Russ Franke, Bill
Huefelder, Roy McHugh and Pat

llivingston of the Pittsburgh

Press; Jimmy Jordan, Dan Mc-
Gibbeny and Jack Sell of the
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette; Ed Con-
way of WTAE; Red Donley of
WIIC; and Pitt athletic publicity
director Beano Cook.
Schottenheimer capped a ﬁne
Pitt career this year with some of
the ﬁnest linebacking seen at
Pitt since all-American John Gu-
zik left the scene in the late
1950s. He was mentioned on some
all-America. teams, on numerous
all-East teams and was selected
for many all-opponent teams.
He succeeds a list of worthy

athletes who have won the award
since its inception in 1962. Past
winners are Woody Haser(”foot-
ball), 1962; Corky Cuthbert (soc-
cer and baseball), 1963; and Paul
Martha (football and baseball),
1964."

Schottenheimer pl.ayed the
right linebackers spot for John
Michelosen’s team and from that
position roamed far and wide
across the ﬁeld to make tackle
after tackle for the Panthers. Al-
though no statistics are kept on
tackles, Schottenheimer easily
led the team in that department.

He was drafted by the Buﬁfalo
Bills of the American Football
League and the Baltimore Colts
of the National Football League
and chose to sign with Buffalo.

A top-ﬂight high school basket-
ball player at Ft. Cherry High
School in McDonald, Pa., Schot-
tenheimer gave up basketball .at
Pitt after a brief ﬂing with the
freshman team. He had been one
of the mainstays of the Ft.
Cherry team which won the state
Class B championship in 1960.

Other awards included the
