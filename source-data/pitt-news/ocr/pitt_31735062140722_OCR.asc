 wssr Will Begin Fund

Drive on Campus Today

World Student Service Fund campaign, which coincides
‘with Brotherhood Week, initiates the campus educational
', program today when members of the Flying squadron com-
mittee, headed by Irving Leiber, BA44, and Ruth Rosen-
bloom, Ed44, speak before various campus organizations.

Money contributed in the

campaign will be used to alle-

viate the needs of prisoners, internees, and refugees who
have been students and faculty members, Lee McFadden,
-BA44, and Mary Ruth Carlson, C44, co-chairmen, explained.
WSSF is sponsored by the United States sections of
the International Student Service and the World’s Student
Christian Federation, and is endorsed by President and

Mrs. Roosevelt.

Charles Brossman, BA44, is in
charge of the booth on the ground
ﬂoor where students and faculty
members may obtain information
concerning the purpose of the fund
and where contibutions will be ac-
cepted.

Said McFadden, “The main part

'of our realization that war has

come to the University is that 200
of our closest friends will be gone
in a few days. The WSSF may
some day help these friends of
ours. Give that they may live.”

World Student Service Fund op-
erates through the International
Red Cross and the war prisoners’
aid of the” YMCA, who are permit-
ted to enter prison camps to ren-
der medical, physical, intellectual
and spiritual service to the intern-
ed. More than 6,000,000 students
are now listed as prisoners all over
the world.

A student in China wrote, “I
am in debt to you not only for
economic support but also for
spiritual encouragement. If I am
successful in medical work in the

A future, your generous help will
have been one of the most essen-
tial. factors.”

“This is the fourth time the

WSSF campaign has been conduct-

ed at the University, but it as-

‘sumes especially great signiﬁcance

this year because of the war,” stat-
ed William Hammakei‘, executive
YMCA secretary, and Dr. Edna T.
Batz, head of the YWCA. faculty
advisers to the campaign commit-

The new course is called The
College Training Department for
Crew Training. It is under the con-
troliof the Commander General of
the Southeastern training center,
Major‘ Geneial Royce. His purpose
at the University is to train men
for the air corps with the possi-

fbility of becoming pilots, bombar-

  Doughboys Sing
Foster Melodies

A group of American doughboys
sat around a bonﬁre in England
two weeks ago and sang a collec-
tion of Stephen Foster melodies
sent to them by the Foster Memo-
rial Hall of the University. A few
days later, Fletcher. Hodges, Jr.,
Curator of the Foster Hall collec-
tion, was the recipient of a letter
written by these same lads, which
included three cheers for the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh.

“Fighting men do not sing songs
of war. They know war too well
to sing about it. They prefer songs
of peace, home, and family,” stat;
ed Mr. Hodges. Foster first won
his laurels as a favorite composer
of soldiers when British troops on
the Crimean battle ﬁelds sang
“Old Folks At Home” along with
“Annie Laurie.” During the first
World War, American lads car-
ried Foster tunes to France to lift
morale in camps and on the ﬁeld.

At present American ﬁghting
men in Northern Ireland, England,
Alaska, Africa, Australia, in the
Caribbean, and on the Paciﬁc, are
being sent song booklets contain-
ing 45 of Foster’s finest melodies.
The booklet ispindexed and illus-
trated with a reproduction of “U.
S. War Calls,” the song book of the
Civil War.

time on academic subjects, such
as math, physics, history, geog-
raphy, English, and civil air

will be spent in drill and physi-
cal training.

“Girls will have little opportu-
nity to see much of the soldiers for
they will be kept pretty close to
their barracks,” said one of the
staff members.

ome timebefore this year the people of this -nation will

to realize the meaning of war, more especially of total .

,. So far, we have been singularly unimpressed by the
{cant of death and destruction. All of us, even workers in
rplants and soldiers in camps, have been spared the close-
ilreality of the sudden snufﬁng out of life and of the crum-
ng of man’s works.

Perhaps this is as well. Fretting does not help. We would
t want the symptoms of fear and rage when the causes of

or. and rage are not present. « _ ,
In the last war we escaped mass slaughter. Our losses,
the light of the losses of other countries, were not large.
. that war our chief role was that of Arsenal of the Allies.
Le supplied the materials; they supplied the ﬁghting men.
Our role in this war will» be a dual one: we shall have
to; pour out a great fund of ordnance and a great fund of

J 2 Before long the casualty lists will come rolling in. We
ve seen only the beginning of ou.r losses in the'Paciﬁc and .

Africa.

. .War is dynamic. Those-who speak of a master-plan of
ttack for this year and next must certainly realize that, in
'oday’s warfare, there ca_n be no such thing as a ﬁxed plan.

ur men have learned that much in trying to stop the Ger-
n_ Mark VI tank. The Russians will learn it as their sup-
_y line grows longer and-that of the German army grows
liorter. , ' _
Every time such a lesson is learned, it is learned
st of life and equipment. ,
J The war will be brought home. It will be brought home

the casualty lists; it will be brought home by an increase ’

f the restrictions on civilianlife; it may be brought home
"attack from the air. ’ ’_ _
Aerial attack, -from the viewpoint of the enemy, would

~be.futile. Nor -would there be merely token bombings. A.

dozen. aircraft could wreck a war plant and the crews could

land at the nearest airport, surrendering themselves and de-.

ganding civil treatment as prisoners of war. ~ g
 The bringing home of the war should end much that is
nsatigsfactory in our lives. It should end absenteeism -and it
ld endthe avarice of the. many who are still -trying .to
cake a good thing out of this war. If it does not end these
vils, it will at least make their existence near-intolerable.
_ The bringing home of the war should end the common,
iackadaisical acceptance of hoarding and business—as-usual.

‘Whatever we do not take upon ourselves to learn will be
ught to us, harshly perhaps, but thoroughly and unforget-
bly. And much will be forced upon us that we could not
arn any other way.

ﬂit,’ “the fans were stewing as Pitt‘

was freezing.”
All of this was, of course, merely

* _a part of the Carlson strategy to
jstiop the potentially high scoring

_ Nittany outﬁt. The only way to stop

‘their famous zone defense was, the

’_f’ good Doctor concluded not to give

"/jthénii anything to defend. You can’t

.;_-K ave a defense against someone who

, won’t- ﬁght and you can’t shoot

. «When you don’t have the ball. And

 ,the’Carlson Kids saw to it that Penn

State, did not have the ball. .
A  ! For twenty-two minutes they held
jthe: Nittanies to a mere ﬁve points.

On theirown part they declined

 with simple majesty even to shoot
fouls.)It was only after fifteen min-
v.1 ates ;of,the half were gone that. they

jevendeigned ‘to accept a foul. Loh-
 meycr _shot this and Pitt had one
 point, A few minutes later;he again
 recevived a foul shotand again made
. it-.7 x P .

 'fThe,..action was so slow in that

first half that the‘ oﬂicials were

gyoved to ask if anyone wanted to

buy a whistle. There were all of six

fouls called during that time, in-
cluding the two Pitt waived.

 * It would be nice if the story of the
Pitt-Pen State game could end here.
Unfortunately, it still takes two
halves to make a whole and the sec-
ond half was a far different matter.
The Staters racked up some twen-
ty-seven points to win 32-13 and
thus they erased all hopes of a post

_ season bid for the Carlson Kids.

“They were just too big for us,”

~ announced Dr. Carlson who, never-
theless. had the satisfaction of

1 knowing that if he couldn’t beat
ithem he had at least provided
a Johnny Lawther and his boys with a

l very confusing, not to say uncom-
y fortable twenty-two minutes. The
game proved but one thing: If
there is anything new under the
sun, Carlson will be the man to

 uncover it. V

Major league baseball may be
awaiting the results of a poll be-

fore it gets started, but Pitt base-_

ball is due to get underway early
next month when baseball Coach
Ralph Mitterling sends out the call
for prospective candidates for the
team. _

A tentative schedule has already
been worked out and, transporta-
tion and suﬂicient players permit-
ting, the University has high hopes
of carrying the schedule through.

One blow to 1943 hopes has al-
ready been received. Howard Scott,
one of the ﬁnest pitching prospects
ever to come to Pitt, received his
orders this ‘week like the other 173
members of Pitt’s enlisted reserve
and expects to leave within two

weeks.

Scott pitched for Wilkinsburg
last season and averaged two and
one-half strikeouts per game. Last
year Scott was a member of the
freshman football’ team.

The baseballers did not do too
well last year as they lost eight
while winning only four of their
games. Their losses included a dou-
ble header to Ohio State by what
one writer termed a “slight mar-
gin” of 31 runs.

Riflers Drop

All was quiet .on the Intramural

front this week. The only game

played was that between the North
Boros and the Sigma Chis Tues-
day night in the first game of the
University intramural basketball
championship series. That game
was taken by North Boros 37-30.
High scorers in the ﬁrst game
for North Boros were Skiles and
McFarlane who tied with eleven

.points ‘apiece. Strickler of Sigma -

Chi collected ﬁfteen of his team’s
thirty points.

The second game. of the playoff
series is scheduled for Wednesday
evening at 6:00 o’clock in the Sta-
dium pavilion.

Closing a disastrous week-end,
the Pitt Riﬂe— team dropped 4
matches last week. The Panthers’
1332 was topped by, Georgia Tech’s
1362, Cornell’s 1351, University of
Washington’s 1353 and West Vir-
ginia's 1401. Gettysburg cancelled
their part of the engagement.

Major Wills, however, feels that
the sharpshooters have improved a
great deal since their previous
matches and says, “We have at
present a team that could equal or
possibly defeat all of last week’s
opponents with the exception of
West Virginia, who ﬁeld one of

   
 
  
 
  
 
 
   
  

Compliments of

the toughest teams in district com-
petition.”

The boys from the hillbilly coun-
try sport one of the highest scores
in their 1401 triumph over the
“smoky city boys.” Results from
last week’s gun-battles are not yet
in the hands of Major Wills.

Everyone has heard and talked
about physical ﬁtness and now the
women at the University are going
to do something about it. Begin-
ning immediately, all women’s or-
ganizations on campus will insert
active events in their social cal-
endar.

Tournaments will be set up and
played oﬁ by representative or-
ganization teams. Bowling teams
are successful and appealing to
most of the girls and these teams
can he formed with ﬁve to eight
players.

A tournament in inter—organiza-
tion playing will be set up in bas-
ketball. For purposes of refresh-
ing knowledge of the basketball
rules and affording an opportunity

'for practice, a refresher session

will be held from 3:80 to 5:60
o’clock in the Cathedral gym on
March 2.

Pitt women will also be able to
take part in the physical ﬁtness
program by attending any one of
the three calisthenics classes new
offered in the gym.

This program is the result of the

desire‘on the part of WAA to set: . 

up something comparable to the

‘competitive athletics prog_ram of-

fered to the boys.,But facilities for
such a program of compulsory ath-

‘letics were found to be lacking,

WAA then contacted WSGAtAand in

P a series of joint conferences ‘they
.worked out this new plan of "physi-

cal ﬁtness for Pitt women.
Girls participating in the activi-
ties will be permitted to keep their
play clothes and rubber soled shoes
in the basket room without charge.
Leaders will be present at all
of the activities to offer special in-
struction in .rules and skills.

of Kauffman’s department store. . , ‘
The exhibit deals largely with the production of war -the Pitt News Ofﬁce, 30th ﬂoor. All
materials here in the city and is called ‘_‘Pittsburgh Indus- . regular members and an those who
try in War.” It includes colorful displays of Pittsburgh’s
more than twenty war industries, a two-hundred andﬁfty
pound bomb, a wooden glider, and the seven hundred and
seventy parts of a propeller shot from the plane of a Unit-
ed States ﬂier during the battle. of Midway. A raft similar .

[to the type used by Captain Ed-
die Rickenbacker will also be on
display. _

Women in defensewill be por-

“trayed by the actual representa-
l tion of women who will make cart-
’ ridge belts which will be directly

sent into battle. While some wom-

[ en inspect and/demonstrate shells,
‘others will demonstrate welding.

The Heinz Aircraft Company

*will have on demonstration sam-

ples of the war materials they are

5 ..providing for the armed forces.

“In all probability, this will
be the last demonstration of this
type for the duration,” said Mrs.

- Vilsack, of Kaufmanrfs adver-

tising department, because of the

’ _ inability to demonstrate vital ma-

terials which are being used to

’ .win the war.” It is believed that

this exhibit will be of special
interest to all students studying‘
: any phase of engineering, how-
ever, the entire school is cor-
dially invited to attend this ex-
hibit. c
The purpose of the display is to
act as an incentive to Pittsburgh-
ers to cooperate with the war ef-
fort to a fuller degree by purchas-

ing all the war bonds possible.
