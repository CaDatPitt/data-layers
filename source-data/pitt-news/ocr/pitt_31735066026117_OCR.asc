GPSA protest ﬁnals week shuttle service

By Paul Grubbs

Staff Writer

The expected transportation
fee has caused unfavorable
response in the Graduate and
Professional Student Association.

Concerned that they are being
charged for services they will
not -be using, GPSA members
last night decided to protest to
the Pitt Board of Trustees.

There were two options dis-‘

cussed. The first was to publicly
boycott the shuttle service.

The second was to sue the
university.

Many GPSA members said that

the fee was unfair because it will

be charged to all students

- regardless of whether they live

in the area the shuttle covers.

One member called the trans-0

portation plan a waste of
money.

GPSA President" Steve Parks
said that he will go "to today’s
Board of Trustees meeting and
say, “This is our expectation,
and this is what will happen if
that expectation is not met.”

Parks defined the association’s
three main objectives:

-It does not feel sufficient
duate student concerns were
ken into account.

-A GPSA committee will be
ormed to monitor the shuttle
ervice next term and report

back about it.

-GPSA is considering litiga-
tion,cboyco,tt or some form of
protest.

Association member Eduardo
Mejias-Cabrera said that he has
seen similar situations at another
university where the reaction"

‘ was to sue, and it worked.

GPSA activist Mark Smith said
that the GPSA was “out of the
loop” when the plan was being
put together by the Student
Government Board.

Smithsuggested that since the
fee would not be charged in the
spring term, the associat_ion

should put together .a committee '
to monitor the service and’ see

what could be done.

Secure all belongings before winter break

By Beth Kovaly

‘ Asst. News Editor

Taking a few precautions
before Christmas break may
insure that your belongings
are still there in January.

The Student Government
Board A Public Safety
Committee has compiled a
checklist of things to do
before you pack up and
head home.

Public Safety Committee
member Mark Chase said the
checklist is. to remind stu-
dents of precautions to take
before leaving campus.

“There are a lot of little
things -— unplugging [appli-
ances], locking the door,
things you may not think
about before you- leave,”
Chase said.

Chase said students, espe-
cially those in the dormito-

For

ries, are urged to be careful
after past Thanksgiving bur-
glaries in Holland Hall on the
second ﬂoor. .

“There’s a lot of concern
after the Holland Hall inci-
dents,” Chase said. “We want
to encourage safety in the
dormitories.”

The committee produced
the top 10 list so that stu-
dents will be prepared, he
said.

“We’re trying to get aware-
ness up on campus,” he said.
“Over Christmas break,
things might happen. The
campus is not as safe as we’d
want it.” ,

These are the top 10 safety
guidelines:

-Do not leave any valu-
ables in your apartment (i.e.
computers, typewriters,
stereo equipment, jewelry,
MAC cards, keys, etc.) For a

small fee, you can rent a
storage space near campus.

-Close and lock all win-
dows and doors.

°Close all blinds.

-Leave a light on a timer
so that someone appears to
be at home during the night.

-Do not leave anything
flammable on or near the
heaters. .

-Make sure you unplug all
appliances and lights (except
for the timer).

°Ask a neighbor to keep
an eye on your apartment
while you are gone.

-Ask someone to collect
your mail or request that it
be held until your return.

°Change the message on
your answering machine.

-Make sure that you take
your keys with you.

-Have your valuables

instance, GPSA could look into
an inexpensive bus pass for the
outlying areas like Shadyside or
Squirrel Hill.

Mejias-Cabrera said the 5,000-
plus graduate students can be
easily unified to present a solid
front. . ‘

The GPSA also discussed ways
it could help graduate students
with their parking situation,
namely making it easier to- pur-

Asa News Editor

It is early afternoon in down-
town Pittsburgh, and an 18-year-
old is beaten by a group of
teenagers wearing blue bandanas.

He is repeatedly kicked in the
head, stomach and back. The
teenager is fighting for his life and
his Los Angeles Raiders jacket as
afternoon pedestrians pause in
shock.

A woman driving by sees What
is happening and barrels her car
up onto the sidewalk, hom blar-

ing. The blue bandanas scatter,

leaving their victim curled up on
the sidewalk.

The bandanas are a grim
reminder of a reality which has
taken hold over the past two years
— organized gangs are in
Pittsburgh.

The fact that gangs are in
Pittsburgh has gradually become
accepted. Metal detectors have
been installed in many city high
schools, trauma centers report a

rise in stabbing and gunshot cases '

and Mayor Sophie Masloff is push-
ing for additional police hiiings.

The major news networks
report “copycat” gangs in
Homewood fashioning themselves
after the Los Angeles-based Crips,
a street gang that is now a national
network.

Gangs are readily identiﬁed by
their colors, which become a gang
signature. Hats, handkerchiefs,
shoelaces and belts of members
will usually be the gang’s primary
color. Crips are still known for its
primary color of blue.

The Tribune Review on May 21,
1992, reported that city police are
growing increasingly worried

, about copycat gangs attempting to

model themselves after the Crips
— gangs of teens in this city wear-
ing one predominant color, like
blue bandanas.

Pitt plans to  Nationality Roomsiiwithin the Cathedral 0

Byjessica Georg
For The Pitt News

(Editors Note: This is the sec-
ond and last part of a two-part
series on the Cathedral of
Learning.)

Pitt students will be able to
visit classrooms in Japan, Austria
and India without leaving cam-
pus if all goes well with the con-
struction of three new
Nationality Rooms in the
Cathedral of Learning.

The Nationality Rooms in the
Cathedral boast the most correct
recreations of classrooms from
23 countries. According to

Maxine Bruhns, director of the
Nationality Rooms and
Intercultural Exchange
Programs, the collection of
rooms is the only oneof its
kind.

The new rooms will be
housed on the third ﬂoor of the
Cathedral, and on the average
will cost a quarter of a million
dollars each, Bruhns said.
Money for the completion of the
projects will be raised by mem-
bers of the community who are
concerned with the preservation
of their heritage at the universi-
ty, as well as maintaining schol-
arship programs and student
exchange programs.

 Records state that in the late
1920s and early 1950s commit-
tees representing the various
nationalities depicted in the
Cathedral met on a regular basis
to plan the raising of funds and
to work on blueprints for the
specialty rooms, much as they
do today. However, the ﬁnishing
of only one room may take up
to 10 years, she said.

The idea for the Nationality
Rooms was one that came from
the same man as the idea for the
Cathedral itself, Chancellor John
G. Bowman. Bruhns explained
that the chancellor wished to
show his appreciation to the
community for donations to the

Holiday season sparks scenic light displays

By David Weimer
Staff Writer

It is enough to make a
person see spots.

Three area light displays
are must-sees:

-First is the Thrift Drug
Celebration of Lights at
Hartwood Acres, in Indiana
Township. This is the first
year for this event, and
Thrift Drug spokesperson
Margot Callahan said she
hopes it will become a
Pittsburgh tradition.

It takes between 15 and

30 minutes to drive through
the two-mile lane lighted
by more than 100,000
bulbs. There is a $5 dona-
tionlper carload and pro-
ceeds go to the Salvation
Army’s Project Bundle Up,
a campaign which has been
providing winter clothing to
children and senior citizens
for the past seven years.
This drive-through light
show is open to the public
each Sunday through
Thursday, from 6 p.m. to 10
p.m., and Friday and
Saturday, from 6 p.m. to 11

p.m. through Jan. 10. For
directions, call 767-9200.

°Not to be out-lit,
600,000 blinking, sparkling
lights at Idlewild Park,
Ligonier, Pa., create a scene
that cannot be missed.

“It’s the largest thing I’ve
ever seen in this area,” said
Tom Butler, operations
manager for Idlewild Park.

This is the first year the
lights have been at
Idlewild. Harry Overly, a
retired shopping center
developer, used to put up a

support student programs.

Willette said there were about
10 students signed up for the Dec.
7 ski trip but most of them can-
celled at the last minute due to
ﬁnals. “We might pick it up next
semester while it’s still winter,” he
said.

He said he hopes to have a mix-
ture of people going next semester
—- staff, faculty and students. “Its
not a bad deal for skiing.”

V/“illetIe said the YMCA is plan-
ning a big fund raiser in February
if they can reserve Fitzgerald
Fieldhouse. It will be called the
“\X7orld’s Biggest Kiss” and will be
in conjunction with KISS radio.

The KISS radio audience and

couples from Pitt, Carlow and “

Duquesne will gather together on
Valentine’s Day. At the given time
they will anange in the shape of a
heart and kiss.

It will be in competition with
other Collegiate YMCAS across the
country. Money will be raised
through sponsors of the partici-
pants in the event, Willette said.

He said he is hoping for 1,000
or 2,000 participants. The same
fundraiser was planned a couple
of years ago but was cancelled
due to bad weather.

This weekend, bad weather —
lots of snow —— should help the
ski fund-raiser.

or local, the frequency of drive—by
shootings has increased dramati-
(ally in a city that had never seen
that type of violence until about
two years ago.

The growth of youth gangs in
Allegheny County coincided with
increased trafﬁcking of drugs and
the arrival of crack to the area,
reported the University of
Pittsburgh’s Office of Child
Development (OCD).

Its report cited the Pittsburgh
Police Department as having iden-
tified six out—of-town gang repre-
sentatives in Pittsburgh: Los

Angeles, Chicago, Houston,
Detroit, Dallas and Jamaica.

Mayor Masloff, in Sept. 1991,
more than doubled the size of the
city narcotics squad. The
Pittsburgh Post Gazette reported
Masloff as saying, “Pittsburgh is
serving notice that it will not give
in to gang violence.”

Allegheny General Trauma
Director Dr. Daniel Diamond said
that the numbers show Pittsburgh
is deﬁnitely seeing an increase in
gang-related trauma cases.

“There has been a tremendous
increase in penetrating trauma,
particularly in gun and particularly
in young men ages 14 to 15 and
18 to 19,” Diamond reported.

Pittsburgh has not seen the
automatic weapon trauma that has
become common in larger cities
like’Miami, Diamond said. But

Gangs

Continued from page 6

“It’s evident by the news report-
ing. You’re starting to see the 
intemal struggle between the exist-
ing gangs and new gangs coming
in.”

Another sign of national gangs
possibly organizing in Pittsburgh,
Giunta said, is increasing reports
of gang initiation activities in the
area. -
Rumors of gang initiations have
even been reported, falsely, in the
news media. WPXI Channel 11
ran a story several weeks ago
about alleged gang initiation rituals
at Ross Park Mall, which, accord-
ing to Ross Park officials, was
completely false. ,

Despite the rumors, the reality
of gang initiations can be danger-

ous, warns Giunta. Some initia-'
‘tions may even call for killing

policemen.

“Sometimes in gang initiations, a
gang member has to prove him-
self to get into the gang,” Giunta
said. “It’s as if they have,to earn
their colors, to show their loyalty,
bravery, that they are willing to do
something.”

Giunta warns that the gangs are
coming in with more fire power
than the city is used to dealing
with. I

“The weapon of choice is a
semi-automatic,” he said. “More
ﬁrepower means more ways to kill
people.” A -

E Gangs see Pittsburgh as an
open market, Giunta said. “You‘1e

developing,” he said. “There’s a
lucrative drug market. You have
supply and demand.”

Drugs have become frequently
used by the city‘s youth, according
to Pitt’s (OCD). Juvenile drug
sales and manufactun'ng rose 157
percent from 1989 to 1990.
Juvenile ‘drug possession alone
-rose 73 percent the same year.

V The East End communities have
been targeted as “hot spots” of
youth street—gang activity. The East
End consists of East Hills, Garﬁeld,
East Liberty and Homewood-

_Brushton. Wilkinsburg is also i

included on the target list.
These communities have a high-

neighborhoods. The population is
mainly African—American, single—
parent households living at or
below the poverty level.
Unemployment and school drop-
out rates are also high.

Visible signs of gang presence
in these areas appears in city
schools through youth harassment,
shootings and stabbings. Many
schools install metal detectors to
stop students from coming to class
aimed.

Some students are refusing to
attend city high schools from what
they say is a fear of gang activity,
the Post—Gczzetfe reported on May

9, 1992.

Many city oﬁicials are hesitant to
report any statistics on gang-relat-
ed, activities. Giunta said one
explanation for that is that they
just don’t know anything ‘yet.

“You’re dealing with a new
phenomenon right now,” Giunta
explained. "A lot of people are just
backing. off. They don’t want to
say anything until they find out
what they’re dealing with.

“[Gang violence] will become a
major problem if people continue
to deny its existence,” Giunta
added. "You Can’t ignore cln've—by
shootings, you can’t ignore the
car-jackings, you can’t ignore the
sporadic, random violence that's
going on."

The Graduate and Professional Student Association
is apparently looking upon the new shuttle service
less than favorably. Last night, GPSA members dis-
cussed ways to protest the fact that they would have
to pay the new security fee, part of which will be
used to pay for the shuttle service.

GPSA’s main beef was the fact that all students pay
the fee whether or not the shuttle covers the area in
which they live. They also felt that graduate stu-
dents’ concerns were not taken into account when
the security fee was created.

GPSA has a legitimate gripe about its lack of repre-
sentation when this student fee was created. Since
there are thousands of graduate and professional
students, their opinions should have been sought
when discussing the fee.

However, it would be impossible to exempt certain '

students from paying this fee. The money generated
is not only going to the shuttle service, but also to
increase the lighting oncampus and create an escort
service. Even where tlleshuttle is concerned it
would be too difficult to keep track of which stu-

7:dents are ijnltlie shuttle zoneS‘.f.,gnd for the drivers to

The security fee works along the same lines as the
computer fee that every student is paying as we
speak. Every student pays over $100 for a pretty
good computer system and very few students use it
totheir full ability. If you are paying for it, you
might as well use it. _

Studentsiwho live farther from campus should
have an option, though. Some typepof small late-
night shuttle service to Squirrel Hill and/or
Shadyside should at least be considered. The stu-
dents who live in those areas need transportation,
especially on late nights from campus, more than
students who live in the extended shuttle service
area. A
Wlierever students live, we recommend that they
take advantage of the shuttle for traveling to any
part of campus, going to parties or a friend’s house,
since they are going to be paying for it.

At the meeting, it was suggested that GPSA forms
a committee to monitor the shuttle during the spring
term. It would be interesting to see what such a
committee would discover. For the most important
thing is-~whether or not the shuttle will benefit all
students, graduate and undergraduate, enough to

. warrant the reported $30 fee.

‘ I am coming-.out., ,

 I am a white, Protestant: 

f erosexual male .' l1\='/Iy‘ ancestry ‘is

.:mainly German and Irish. I am

,not pliysically challenged. I am
not mentally challenged. I-was

T born and raised in the United

States by two parents who are
‘not alcoholics, are not abusive
andlwho both have jobs. v

I hope none of these charac-
teristics will hinder my entrance
into law school. As I complete
applications for a variety of
schools, I can voluntarily pro-
vide my ethnic background.
For other applications, I can
provide pictures of myself.
Unfortunately, I am reluctant to
do any of those things.

I do like myself. However, in
the admissions considerations
at these law schools, I feel like
I am at a disadvantage because
of my background. All the
schools emphasize their desire
for diversity in their student
body. Many people with better
qualifications than mine will be
accepted. People with worse
qualifications also will be
accepted. My worst fear is not
getting into the school of my
choice simply because I am a
white male.

Our society is dominated by"

white males. Curricula in
schools and standardized tests
favor white males.

I believe I have performed
well in all aspects of my acade-
mic career. Was all of this suc-

Hatred ispa

ground? On do I have a certain
a111ount»of§-ability that would
allow ismve-lto do well in most
educati;o'na-lbsettings? The dis-
coveiy Tof _biases in the educa-
tional process has caused_me to
question myself.

In public, when my friends
want to- say anything pertain-
ing to any other group with dif-
ferent characteristics, they feel
the need to scan the area and
speak in hushed tones. Are we
not allowed to say certain

Kichline
things because we are different
from that group?

People who are discriminated
against have a certain contempt
for people who do not share
their particular characteristic. I
cannot identify with any
oppressed groups.

Does this mean I do not
understand their feelings? Does
this mean I have no business in
their particular concerns? Does
this mean I cannot care about
what they are doing?

My answer is no.

I know what it’s like to be
made fun of for the way I look.
I know what it’s like to be
stereotyped. I know what it’s
like to‘be called names. I have
worked at places where I was
the only person of my kind. I

hiive been-‘rejected for jobsfijl

really wanted.‘  have receiveél
bad grades in ‘classes becatisg
they were structured against

me. I have had teacl1e1*s'\\rli:o I

did not like me. I have been
limited by financial resources. 

I know what it’s like for peo-
ple to question your sexuality. I
have been scorned for the peo-
ple I have loved.-I know how it
feels when people think you
use drugs. I have been
ridiculed for my religious
beliefs.

I know what it’s like not to
be able physically to do what
others find simple. I know
what it’s like to be picked last
for the team. -

I know what it’s like for peo-
ple to make fun of the way I
talk. I have felt what it’s like for
people to demean the way I
think. I have had people mock
the things I say.

With my “perfect” back-
ground, I have still experienced
all of these things. I have not
been insulated from human
cruelty.

V Human nature is the cause
of discrimination. I have been
surrounded by other humans
for over 21 years. I have an
idea of the problems in society.
Being a white, Protestant, het-
erosexual male does not make
me immune to that.

Ed Ktc/91-me is a columnist for
The Pitt News.

The bible is just slightly outdated

Dear P-ttt News,

I am writing in response to
a letter printed in the
Perspective section on Nov.
30 that stated that homosexu-
ality is sinful. The writer cited
Leviticus 20, verse 13. This
verse does in fact seem to
back up his position, howev-
er, Leviticus also says a few
other things that Christians
often ignore. ’

°Eating pork, ham, bacon‘,
etc., is forbidden (Lev. 11:17).

-Eating seafood other than

fish, such as shrimp, is forbid-
den (Lev. 11:10-12). ’
-Women must sacrifice one
lamb or two pigeons after
childbirth (Lev. 12:6-8).

Letters

-If you have a skin disease,
you must see a priest (Lev. 13:
1-2).

°Any clothing with mildew
must be brought to a priest
(LEV. 13: 47-49). ,

-Anyone who touches a

woman having her period ‘will
be unclean until evening (Lev.
15:19).

-Wearing clothing made of
two different kinds of material
is forbidden (Lev. 19:19).

°Shaving is forbidden (Lev.
19:27). ’

I have to ask, are these the
“true morals” that Christians

refer to when they condemn
_ homosexuality as a sin. ‘

A Top-20 recruiting class, a

Sbppy effort gives hoops first loss

By Stephen Liss
Stajf Writer

Sloppy play and a no-motion
offense helped Georgetown
stamp its ﬁrst Big East Conference
win of the season, 80-66 over Pitt.

It was the Panthers’ ninth loss
out of the last 10 trips to the
Capitol Center in landover, Md.

The game started with Pitt win-
ning the opening tip. Before 15
seconds ticked off the clock
Panther forward Chris McNeal
was fouled and sent to the free
throw line. He bricked the first
one, then nailed the second. Pitt
led 1-0, it was McNeal’s only
point of the game.

“Chris had a tough night,” Pitt
head coach Paul Evans said. “He
just didn’t move around enough.
He stood there in the post and
had a lot of trouble moving
against their zone.”

He wasn’t the only one that
had a tough night. Evans was

ejected mid-way through the sec- -

ond half after picking up two
technical fouls in a row.

“I just thought they were iiding
our guys,” Evans said in his post
game show. “I told them [the offi-
cialsl ‘You got to get ‘em off of
my guys.”

That was just the first one‘.
Before Joey Brown could finish
shooting the two free throws for
the technical foul, Evans picked
up another one. Lany Lembo was
the Big East official who whistled
Evans for the additional foul.

“The second one wasn’t much
worse than the first in teiins of
what I said,” Evans said. “Larry
called it and we’ve had some
problems with him the last few
years.”

Assistant coach Norm Law took
over as ringmaster once Evans

Generalovich awaits shot
to match Generals star

By Stephen Liss
Staff Writer

Thirty-one years ago, a sturdy young man by the
name of Brian Generalovich graced the freshly scuffed
floor of the Fitzgerald Field House.

Brian’s fleet-footedness, Vicious slash-to-the-hoop
moves and underhand free throws helped the 6-foot-4-
inch forward become one of just 22 players in the his-
tory of Pitt basketball to reach the 1,000 point mark.

The Panthers were 48 and 25 in those three years.
“The General” was a star.

A generation later, his son Brock is in charge of car-
rying on the family tradition. Pitt is 51 and 55 in the
three seasons Brock has been with this team. His
impressive totals: 12 games played, 22 minutes of court
time, six points. .

“But I’m the best shooter on the team,” the 61”

guard says emphatically. “I tell you, I’m the best out-

side shooter on the team!”

Wait a minute. The statistics say he is a mop-up\play—
er. The way head coach Paul Evans uses him makes
him a mop-up player. Yet the second generation
Generalovich insists he can make a difference this
year.

“I’ve worked with the system long enough to know
how to do all the littlethings very well,” contends
Generalovich._ “The people that have come in to play,
the ones they’re trying to break in now, don’t know
these things to well and they’re going to make mis-
takes. A

“I don’t think I’m going to be the guy burning the
ball through the hoop flying through defenses on the
way to the basket like Jerry [McCullough]. But I can get
off the shot. I know how to get myself in position to
get the shot off and those are the kinds of things I’d
like to be able to do for Evans this year.”

Unfortunately for Pitt basketball fans, we probably
won’t get the chance to see what Brock can really do.
Evans is content leaving the three—point sharp shooter
on the bench regardless of the potential contributions
he could make in a game.

.It wasn’t always like this for Brock. Four years ago
he was in the limelight at Hickory High School in
Hermitage, Pa. A three sport letterman in basketball,
football and baseball, Brock earned‘ enough awards

O'Connor cripples Pitt

Thank you, J. Dennis O’Connor.
Thank you very much! ~

If it wasn’t enough to spend
$92,000 remodeling your chancel-
lor‘s mansion, you single—handedly
destroyed Pitts football program by
being ignorant of what college
football is all about —— winning.

_W‘m (win) -1. toga-in a victory,
be victorlozag tn'zm;0/92. to succeed

in reaching or aclﬁeuing a specyied .

condition or place.

Being the scholarly leader of this
university, O’Connor should know
this definition. But, instead, he is
following the same nonchalant
footsteps of his predecessor, the

r honorable Wesley Posvar.

Last week, when O’Connor per-
sonally vetoed Jackie Shenill as the
Panthers’ next head coach, the ver-
dict was in. He would not tolerate
a bad image that would tarnish
Pitts academic and athletic stan-
daids.

Whether it was Sherrill’s viola-
tions at Texas A&M or th_e castrated
bull incident at Mississippi St,
O’Connor simply said “No” to
Sherrill and all of his supporters,
including Athletic Director Oval

Cory
Walborn

Jaynes.

O’Connor said “no” not only to a
person he appointed and suppos-
edly shared similar views with, he
also said “no” to winning. With

that, O’Connor left 90’football play- ’

ers and thousandsof alumni and

‘students in a precarious situation.

They will all suffer the same fate
without having any contfol over it.

 

football

The fate — the pains of losing
while under the whip of the
O’Connor tyrant. ,

It is a shame that O’Connor
thwarted a proven winner like
Sherrill. He only compiled a 50-9-1
record while at Pitt, not to mention
guiding Texas A&M to several
Cotton Bowls or even the miracle
work he has done at Mississippi St.
Sherrill can get the recruits, the sup-
port of the alumni and fans and the
respect of his players — all the
needed ingredients to win and win
often. 

The only support that Sherrill
could not obtain was O’Connor‘s.
Granted, Sherrill does not mm the
cleanest of football programs, and
his ethics might come into question

' sometimes. But what are Pitts, or
more likely O’Connor’s, priorities?

Academics —— that is what
O’Connor preaches. It is what the

chancellor wants. It is what
O’Connor is. He is an academic
chancellor who will not even try to
balance studies and football. Dr.
O’Connor, this is not Harvard; it is
Pitt. Help our academics, chancel-
lor, but don’t kill our athletics in the
same breath.

Pitt may still wind up with a
good coach. O’Connor may accept
Johnny Majors as the man who A
could turn Pitt football around. But
it is very ironic" that Majors, who
did a few shady things during his
tenure at Pitt, would be welcomed
with open amrs by O’Connor while
Shem'll, who committed similar
mistakes, was kicked in the face by
the O’Connor boot.

Majors would do an excellent
job, but it would be short term.
\V1th his failing health, Majors
might only be around here for
three to ﬁve years. Sherrill would

‘ be able to make a longer commit-

ment, maybe over 10 years or so.
Pitt needs an intense head coach
who would not be the quick—fix
hero but a long—haul savior.

There are rumors that surround
this possible long-term solution —
Shenill — and they stated that he
did not want to come to Pitt at all.
The rumors said that Sherrill only
used Pitt as a ploy to get a higher-_
paying contract at Mississippi St.
Even if the rumors are true,
O’Connor still vetoed the former
Panther coach.

' \X/‘here does’ O’Connor stop?
How clean of a program does he
want? It is very honorable to make .-
Pitt an academic giant and have
your players graduate. But do you
also sacriﬁce these well-studied ath-
letes on the football field? It is very
dishonorable to lose when you are
not pemritted the opportunity to
win.

It’s this opportunity that will
haunt Pitt in the future. J. Dennis
O’Connor, in his search for 90
scholar athletes to form his football
team, has shown‘ his arrogance to
what his players, his alumni and his
student body desperately want — a
winner.

Thank you, J. Dennis O’Connor.
Thank you for stretching Pitfs left
hand toward the academia stars
while cutting off the bruised and -

batlered athletic right.

Amidst all this fun and festivi-
ty, we have to take time out for
a serious moment and give our
most special gift. 0

God’s blessing, all our sin-
cere prayers and the strength

to Walk again —- to Dennis Byrd.
His courage should move us and
make us all realize how fortu-
nate we all are. His Jet team-
mates told the nation about the
Dennis Byrd they all know and
love in a touching waterfall of

emotion. For an athlete to lose
some of the gifts that have

made his life so special is a
terrible tragedy. Every once

in a while all of us — the

media, players and fans —
receive shocking doses of reality,

and hopefully something posi-
tive will come from Byrd’s
strength.

THE Pl'l'l" NEWS, Thursda 8 i,”  been-*1u;‘19l9z: 

Brock

Continued from page 11
and trophies to fill a refriger-
ator box.

He was recruited heavily
by every Ivy League school
and several big name
Division I colleges to play
football and basketball.
Instead of signing with one
of those teams, he chose to
walk on as a first—year stu-
dent at Pitt.

“I wanted to go to med
school,” explains
Gernalovich. “I knew if I
came to Pitt as an under-
graduate I would have a bet-
ter chance of getting into the
medical school.

“I didn’t come in here with
the attitude that I was going
to be the next savior of the
basketball team, but I knew
if I got that chance I could
show Evans what I could
do.”

With Sean Miller, Jason
Mathews and Darelle Porter
playing ahead of him, Brock
never even got that chance.
Does it matter to him?

“In my house my dad was
very happy to see me play
ball, but he never really
pushed me to do anything
except get good grades.

“He doesn’t want me to
play any more because he
feels it’s interfered with my
academics,” says
Generalovich.

Brock keeps running out
of excuses to tell his dad
why he is playing ball while

carrying 19 credits as a
behavioral neuroscience
major. Pride might be the
underlying factor.

The elder Generalovich
played four years of varsity
sports, three as a basketball
player and one as a football
player while in his first year
of dental school. By 1968,
Dr. Generalovich had pro
offers to play with the New
York Knicks and the Boston
Patriots. He turned them
down. Pulling teeth was
more respectable at the time.

“You can see how much
things have changed as far
as athletics and academics
go,” says Generalovich.
“Now it is so difficult time
wise with the amount of
class work and practices. It’s
kept me very disciplined.

“When we start traveling in
the second semester it gets
real hard for me. One semes-
ter I missed 17 exams.”

While his on—court num-

~bers have declined dramati-

cally since coming to Pitt,
Brock still posts an impres-
sive stat off the court — a
3.1 QPA. He’s doing much
more than the average stu-
dent, and he’s still not con-
tent.

“I want to make more of a
contribution other than
bringing the team grade
point average up and being
known for working really
hard in . practice,”
Generalovich said. “It’s not

something I’m doing for fun.
I’m playing basketball
because it’s an opportunity
that most people don’t get,
and I’m good enough to be
there. But it’s not what I’m
going to do for the rest of
my life. Med school is what I
really want, and if I get into
Pitt medical school this will
all be worth it.”

Generalovich will graduate
in May. That is when he will
enter a different arena.
Getting into graduate school
will be his number one pri-
ority this year. Along the
way he’d like to make a dif-
ference on this year’s hoop
squad.

“If people still say that I’m
a stiff as a basketball player,
I can’t worry about that. I
don’t care,” stresses
Generalovich. “The most
important thing is that we
win .ball games, and all I
want to do is be a part of
that.”

Unlike his father, if Brock
Generalovich’s 15 minutes of
fame come at Pitt, it will
probably be in the emer-
gency room at one of
the local hospitals. But that’s
notto say the family torch
hasn’t already been passed
along. Some records are
bound to fall eventually. And
at 270 pounds, the real gen-
eral is no longer a match for
the youthful Brock — in a
backyard gameof one-on-
one.

be really nice to have him.”

One day before returning
to Oakland, the Panthers
will be taking on a talented
Miami squad, which will be
looking to avenge its loss to
Pitt in the Big East
Championships last year. Pitt
defeated the ‘Canes by 300
points in that meet as Miami
finished third, with Villanova
coming in second.

This meet could be a differ-
ent story, however, as Pitt will
be facing Miami in the ‘Canes
home water and without
breaststroke artist Don Boyd,
who is still recovering from an
illness.

“They have been swimming
very fast so far this year,” Pitt
Coach Chuck Knoles said. “I
expect them to be our biggest
competition in the Big East this
year.” , -

“Miami has a small but very
strong squad this year. They
are a very well-coached team,”
Amato said.

But Pitt also has a fairly good
coach in Knoles —— named
men’s Coach of the Year last
year in the Big East — and
should give the Hurricanes all
they can handle.

“At this point in the season,
we should both be at about the
same point in our training,”
Knoles said. “Against Miami,
the diving will be held as a
separate event, so we will see
how thetwo swimming teams
stack up head to head. I hop
to be competitive.” .

Hoops

Continued from page 11
made his way off the court. By
that time, the circus was almost
over.

Both teams looked pathetic

— Pitt looked worse. The
Panthers had 13 first half tum
overs to the Hoyas 11. Pitt
missed 18 free throws shooting
just 42 percent from the line.
A Panther guard Jerry
McCullough came into the
game having shot 17 for 17
from the line in the first two
games. He bounced four of
them off the back of the iron on
his way to a four-for—eight per-
formance from the charity
stripe.

I McCullough’s lousy first half
shooting overshadowed a mar-
velous ballhanclling exhibition
by the crafty point guard. On
several occasions, he single-
handedly broke the
Georgetown press while dish-
ing out a few pretty passes. By
halftime McCullough had one
point, but finished the game
with 12.

Pitt jumped out to an early 8-
5 lead, but it quickly disap-
peared. The Hoyas went on a
7-0 run and never relinquished
the lead.

The marquee matchup was
supposed to be between two
up-and-coming Big East cen-
ters. Georgetown’s first-year
player Othella Harrington vs.
Pitt’s second-year dunk master
Eric Mobley. Harrington made
his statement with 16 points
and 13 rebounds. Mobley
mashed the Cap Center’s rims
for two dunks, nine points and
12 boards.

The title role should have
gone to Pitt forward Antoine
Jones. Thirty of his friends and
relatives proudly looked on as
the Baltimore native delivered a
masterful soliloquy.

The nimble forward posted a .

career—high 18 points to go
along with his eight rebounds.
Despite the overall numbers,
even Jones had some first half
woes. ' .

“We just stood around,” Jones
said. “They were in a zone for
most of the first half, and we all
panicked. The second half we
were able to relax and execute
much better.” ,

The Panthers came out firing
in the second frame.

With Ahmad Shareef on the
bench suffering from a twisted
ankle, junior college transfer
Marlon Rhymes took over the
two guard spot for Pitt. J

He nailed a three-point
shot at the 10-minute mark

which pulled the Panthers to.

within four points 54-50.
Rhymes finished the game with
13.

Pitt kept it close for about 45
seconds. Another mini-run by
the Hoyas put the game out of
reach. Two free throws by
Brown, one _ by Robert
Churchwell, a tum-around hook
shot by Lonnie Harrell, a Don
Reid lay-in and the technical
fouls made the score 61-51 and
all but wrapped up Barnum
and Baileys performance.

As if the first 39 minutes
weren’t enough of a joke,
the last minute seemed to e-Pitt-
omize the Panthers’ play.
McCullough missed a wide

son. The Panthers will host
-WVU this Saturday at the

open layup, Mobley let a dunk
slip through his hands and first-
year point guard Garrick
Thomas dribbled the ball off his
leg for the 19th Pitt tumover of
the night.

Georgetown’s record
improves to 3-0, while Pitt
slides to 2-1 on the early sea-

Fitzgerald Field House.

Dunk Watch: Oh, by the
way, if you’re keeping score at
home the dunk watch looks
like this —- Mobley’s pair gives
him six on the season. Jones
added one — he now has
three. Orlando Antigua’s break-
away blam in the first half gave
him two for the year, while
Shareef and McCullough stay
stagnant at one. I

numbers against Florida and
Tennessee, but Torretta played
miserably in the Canes’ two
biggest games of the year, pro-
ducing a mere 80 passing
yards against Penn State and
doing everything in his power
to almost lose the FSU game
for Miami.

Anyone who saw nothing
more than SportsCenter clips
of Hearst probably cannot
appreciate the man’s greatness.
Imagine a glamour tailback
leading a sweep, mowing over
defenders with zeal, throwing
blocks downfield for receivers.

His acceleration is breathtak-
ing, and he kicks it in so
quickly that even in goal line
situations he can cut the cor-
ner to the short side and blow
by you. It’s as if he lulls line-
backers to sleep, then — see
ya — Hearst is gone.

0 A few quick thoughts on
the NFL now that crunch time
is upon us. The AFC might
think about relinquishing its
Super Bowl berth altogether
and allow the top two NFC
clubs to meet in Pasadena.

In a desperate search for an
AFC contender, one has not
emerged. All-points bulletin —
if anyone out there knows of
one, please, let us all in on
who that mighty team might
be. ,

San Francisco has clearly
separated itself from the field,
but New Orleans, Dallas and
Philly could all be heard from
when it’s all said and done.

Once Ricky Watters returns
from his deep shoulder bruise,
the Niner machine will be
primed for a title chase.

 

or
17

Despite the stats, the Frisco
defense will not break easily in
January.

The Saints’ defense gives
them a chance against anyone
on any field, but Jim Mora
absolutely must open up his
gameplan on offense. Bobby
Hebert seems more confident
than in past seasons, but those
fourth-quarter failures always
haunt the ragin’ Cajun.

The Cowboy defense rates
high statistically but could
crack at any moment. That’sec-
ondary is a joke vs. dangerous
passers. The Eagles showed
last week at Candlestick that
when they’re on, watch out. If
Andre Waters and Wes
Hopkins recover for the post-
season, Gang Green should

-punﬁh.

-And, oh yes, in college
football’s yearly disgrace, the
Cotton Bowl (the grinch that
ruins-New Years ‘93) unbe-
lievably broke the Bowl
Coalition and took Notre Dame
rather than Florida State. This
is an out—and-out travesty and
yet another step in the mina-
tion of a sport due to merciless
greed. Baseball has long been
ruined, and it appears college
football is next.

Furthermore, Notre Dame is
not the marquis attraction it
used to be. Poll real college
football fans and see who they
would rather watch — the
same old Irish or the scintillat-
ing Seminoles. Encourage your
friends to turn off the Cotton
Bowl and boycott Notre Dame.
Enough is enough.

Earning respect and recognition as a
Jung rap artist entails much more than
st creating slaimning beats, catchy hooks
1d ﬂavorful styles.
Even talented groups ﬁnd the road to
lCC€SS paved with moments of frustration
'lCl doubt. In a market inundated by com—
ercialized sell-outs, those who remain
llie to the game can easily become lost..
{New Basix, an underground trio from
oungstown, Ohio, is determined to
reak through — on its own terms.
ringing a completely underground style

received substantial airplay on Pitt’s own
WPTS—FM, 98.5. Comprised of the 10th
Brotha, 501 and the Jester, New Basix has

been together for a year and a half and "‘

already has enough material to fill two
full-length double LPs.

The 10th Brotha is El-Jay Williams, a 21-
year-old Pitt student. 501 and the jester
are brothers, Levi and Jesse Haywood,

ages 16 and 17. Overseeing, advising and
contributing to the production aspects of '

the group are the Haywoods’ older broth-
ers, Ross, 22, and Shajehan, 20. Ross lends
an experienced perspective that thus far
has steered’ New Basix in the right direc-
tion. . j

really sell what we anticipate,” Ross said.
“Everybody wants to sell well,  but a lot
of good groups that I’ve heard really didn’t
sell a lot.” ‘

According to New Basix, rising as an
unknown artist is not all frusttation despite
the disadvantages and drawbacks. Their
love for the music runs so deep that the
flaws of the industry fail to discourage
them. “It’s hard. It’s overcrowded with a
lot of phony groups,” the Jester said.

_ “It’s frustrating and it’s fun  the frustra-
tion comes when you try hard and know
that you’re doing good, and others think
that you’re doing good. But once you pre-
sent it to someone, they know that it’s

501 and the 10th Brotha do most of the

of the production work, tediously working

Ross oversees a great deal of the pro-

studio and has carefully taught his
younger brothers about the music —

Howling with The Laughing Hyenas

By Mike Sula
Stajf Writer

The Laughing Hyenas slake the human thirst
for dysfunction. If the Laughing Hyenas did
not exist we would have to invent them. If we
did not exist, the Laughing Hyenas would not
care. The Laughing Hyenas remain no less the
nucleus of human civilization, an incarnation
of the mythological longing for sacrifice, suf-
fering, romance and beauty. Thousands
worldwide have left their native lands to see
the Laughing Hyenas in search of an allegori-
cal contentment denied them at home.

They were a howling, rolling, pain box,
reeling with unsuppressed rage, rocking,
pouting, sneering and snarling with a kind of
displaced anger that can only explode from a
breeding puddle of coddled inertia like Ann
Arbor, Michigan (or Pittsburgh, Pa.). It was a
negative approach to the rock thing, certainly
neither the first nor the last, but one that was
so overﬂowing with bile that that it inevitably
rose up over the ears, numbing all sensation
but. for a kind of unexplainable resentment of
all things loopy.

The Hyenas were Jon Brannon, screeching

banshee from the Brian Johnson School of
Rubber Roomed Crooners; Larissa Strickland,

guitar—twisting imp who used to watch
spaghetti westerns with the sound turned

down and the The Birthday Party jacked in;l

Kevin Strickland, the Frost Giant Jar], laying
down plod with the constancy of the Song of
the Volga Boatmen and the omnipresence of
the Seven Dwarves, and Jim Kimball, who
appeared out of the jungle one morning with
a bass drum claiming to have partaken of the
boiled ﬂesh of a German safari group.

Together they scaled mountains of shimmer-
ing anguish, Brannon’s ballads of pure spite
laced with the scalp—licking wail of guitar and
rumbling rhythm. The world was their master
and they its slaves. It was the smell of napalm
in the morning, the real rain, the swirling
cake mold of black and red humors. As you
might expect, there was a terrible accident.

In the year 1987 (The Year Chunk Choked),
Merry Go Round came outta the hole. Six
songs from which was culled a minor geek
radio hit, the epic Louis L’Amour ballad
“Gabriel.”

For some reason that trumpet wailing up
and over the chug-a—lug cattle drive on the
open range boxed our ears because one year
later You Com? PmyA Lie introduced the idea
of death after Tracy Pew, and those with the

Femme soul revisitec.

in Gargaro'S Beehive

By Lori M. Bossert
Staﬂ'Writer

Ah, the ‘60s. Hair spray. Teasing
combs. Beach parties. Girl groups.
The British Invasion. The Civil
Rights Movement. Protest songs.
It’s all apart of Gargaro
Production’s Beehive, currently
playing at the Stephen Foster
Memorial Theater in Oakland.

Beehive is billed as “The Sixties
Classic Rock Musical.” Actually, I’d
call it a revue. There isn’t really a
plot, simply narration that links
the musical numbers together.
Etta Cox narrates the ‘60s through
the eyes of a young, irnpression—
able teenager who matures with
the music of the ‘60s, following
the same progressions from the
happy innocence of the early
years to the more mature, insight-
ful music of the protest era. The
script runs pretty thin, but it
serves to date the music and
relate it to the historical and social
events of the era.

The show features an ensemble
of six women, all strong singers
and dancers. Headed by Cox, the
acclaimed jazz vocalist, the cast

includes Maria Becoates—Bay,"

Sharon Connelly, Sandra Rae
Dowe, Tamara Flodine and Rema

‘Webb. These women can sing.
Each holds her own admirably,
belting out the songs of the ‘60s
with high energy and enthusiasm.

Most of the first act is a campy
send—up of the bubble gum rock
and girl groups of the early ‘60s.
The first sequence is set in Cox’s
garage, with the cast portraying a
group of teenage girlfriends
singing their favorite songs and
impersonating their girl-group
idols. The jokes are cheap and
easy, and the cast’s clowning
occasionally goes overboard, but
the music more than makes up
for this. Some standouts were
Becoates—Bay’s “One Fine Day,”
Connelly’s “Walking in the Sand/I
Can Never Go Home Again” and
a medley of Supremes songs. All
the standards of 3'\X7S airplay are
here — the only one missing is
“Leader of the Pack.”

The second sequence is Cox’s
fantasy of being at Leslie Gore’s
(Of “It’s My Party” fame)
Christmas party, rubbing elbows

and singing Songs with her teen’

idols. Still campy and clownish,
there are some hilarious moments
— especially Becoates—Bay’s
impersonation of Annette
Funicello, complete with

the Jesus Lizard
Liar
Touch ‘n Go Records

Unlike any other independent rock
outfit, the Jesus Lizard is tense. Not
really physically so, although to look at
lead vocalist David Yow you’d think
so. His bulging veins, psychotic
glances, scarred upper right eye and
frail frame make him look like a junkie,
or at least Bobby D’s clone from Cape
Fear or Mickey Rourke in Barﬂy.

No, the Jesus Lizard is emotionally
and mentally tense. It’s also one of the
tightest rock groups I’ve ever heard.
With this, the band’s fourth full—length

album (toss in the first drum—machined

E.P. Pure and it’s five) for Indie rock’s
most respected label (Touch ‘n Go),
the Jesus Lizard returns with the goods
that have earned it the respect of its
peers and the major labels, who have
opened a bidding war for their talents.
Consistently, the group churns out a

heavy stalking bass with quick, -almost
catchy guitar riffs over an active drum
kit with Yow blurting his psycho bab-
ble.

Yow is undeniably the leader of this
quartet. In the past he has played with
his testicles on stage as the band
ripped through the instrumental “Tight
and Shiny.” While his actions were part
spectacle, part perversion it proved the
point that he indeed does have balls,
literally and figuratively. He’s a weird
hybrid, one who is dangerous, yet
playful, like Chucky from C/9ila"s Play.
On Liar, Yow’s voice is again buried in
the dense musical mix. Trying to
understand and even distinguish lyrics
is part of the fun with this band.
Thankfully the band offers a lyric sheet
on the inside sleeve of the album, so
you can sing or mumble along. But this
is no easy task. Yow’s tongue is slip-
pery making the chore like trying to
recite slick nursery rhymes for the first
time.

The album’s curtain raiser,
“Boilermaker,” is an immediate adrena-
line pumper. The rapid drum kick of
Mac McNeilly and the jerky guitar of
Duane Denison give way to David Wm.
Sims beefy bass as Yow rants over and
over, “Make me another boilermaker.”
He needs it. “Gladiator,” possibly the
album’s finest moment, is a funky num-
ber propelled by a thump-filled rhythm
section and frantic sonic guitar blasts.
Yow screaming “You should see her
use a gun” tempts us to stand in the
face of his demented actress, as the
music’s high—powered drive pierces the
ear. It’s a blissful moment if you’re into
uncontrollable rage and/or the seedy
life of the underworld.

What makes the Lizard such an ambi-
tious, unstoppable outfit is the constant
barrage of music it thrusts upon the lis-
tener. The guitars and bass often trade
places, pushing the song near delirium.
Then, almost out of nowhere (unless
you’re familiar with its sound), the gui-

tar drops and all that’s left is a funk-
filled bass riff and a Porsche-driven,
punk-influenced drum kick. The spiral-
ing breaks in the songs are memorable,
they are the makeup of the band’s
demented stance beautifully parlayed
with Yow’s manic tales of inner woe.
“Puss” doesn’t have lyrics on the
inner sleeve. It’s the first video from
Liar, and Yow didn’t want MTV to get
a hold of the words — for obvious rea-
sons. It’s a smart ploy, there is no way
anyone in his or her right mind can
decipher them. It doesn’t matter
though, it’s the music that counts and
“Puss” packs a wallop. A fragile guitar

riff with a distinct, dare I say poppy

catch feel, and bludgeoning bass Say as
much as Yow’s strained vocal weavings
and grunts indicate.

His vocals are hidden and surreal.
On “Wfliirl,” one of the album’s quieter
moments, Yow seems to be choking
over the words “get undressed/’ but I

The show then turns serious
with Cox’s moving rendition of
“The Beat Goes On,” blended
with narration on Kennedyis
assassination and the beginnings
of the Civil Rights movement. Her
voice is expressive and eloquent,
painting a moving picture of the

troubled times that were begin-——

The Second Act features several.
glitzy send—ups of rock’s first

Franklin and Janis Joplin. Cox,
Webb, Becoates-Bay and Dowe
burn up the stage as they take
turns singing such greats as “A

(Dowe) and “Piece of My Heart”
(Dowe). As well, Flodine gives a
haunting rendition of “Sociéty’s
Child” and Cox gives the most
soulful “Me and Bobbie McGee”

moment is probably Becoates-Bay

pigeon from the Hyenas was
out and foremost in every-
one’s thoughts.

What happened in the two

1 years since that breakthrough

slab? The rhythm fell out.
Kevin Strickland and Jim
Kimball, citing biological dif-

ferences broke off to form
Mule, ‘a cover band that
played sea chanties at wed-
dings. Now we have the
reformed Hyenas releasing
this, this Crawl. Brannon and
the female Strickland, now on
growth hormones, have so
much respect for Kevis Reis
(the new bassist) that they
neglected to put his photo on
the back. There’s no telling
who will be on bass next
Thursday when the Hyenas
play. -the CMU Graduate

Coffeehouse in Skibo Hall.

Yep, they’ll be here riding on
Crawl, a four song EP that
on first listen, lacks, is lax

but could conceivably age

well. B

1 One schmuck called the
Hyenas, “the Birthday Party
without ideas.” Those who
have locked themselves
inside late at night letting the
last three records peel their

faces off know better.
Another less schmucky
schmuck said, “They are the
apotheosis of suburban white
boy rage in the post—Black
Flag wasteland.”

Whatever. Go anyway;
because it could get brutal.
Along with the reformed
Laughing Hyenas, there is an
offering of Crain, possibly a
great band. At least they are
mentioned in the same breath
as Louisville greats Bastro and
Slint. Also, local Don
Caballero, known for its fine
instrumentals of length that
stink of art rock progressions.
Soul Magnet opens the whole

thing. Remember to thank.

Manny on the way out.
Laughing Hyenas, Crain, Don
Caballero and Soul Magnet,
one week from tonight at the
CMU Graduate java hat, 8
pm.‘ sharp. A swell Christmas
idea.

want to.” That’s the only
words out of Yow on the
whole track. It’s a personal
issue with the Lizard r— you
decide what it means. The
booming bass line that opens
the cut will help you think. On
the revving “Rope” Yow spits
out a tale of murder with a
touch of the disgusting. “No
bricklayer or mason he/ but a
trowel was in his ass.”
Sometimes, it can be fun to
think about ways to die.

“Slave Ship” is L-iar’s most
ambitious cut. It’s a mid-tempo
number that breaks into a
screeching, high—pitched guitar
shrill. The hypnotic rhythms
make it the moodiest track as
Yow’s distorted vocals follow
the bouncing drums for a bit
then splinter off into their own
maniacal world. It’s a desper-

 

 
 

ate song as he weeps, in a
sadistic tone, “I’ve seen my
mother go before/ I’ve seen
my father go before” it goes all
the way down his immediate
family until he reaches his
friends. It’s an ode to slavery
of the past, a sign of the white
man’s guilt.

When the Lizard plays live,
dancing is a requirement. Not
your moshing or slam dancing
that goes on at most Indie rock
shows that boast the same
aggression. For the Lizard it’s
more of a head-nodding,
sway—your—partner hoedown.
It’s a fun and friendly atmos-
phere, unlike the record’s
more inhumane approach. It’s
just the sort of irony that David
Yow and the Jesus Lizard
thrive on.
