No doubt many'- msnulibers from the

Pitt Hoover Club will be called up-
ion to serve at the downtown office

spare time to enroll new Hooverites
and also to carry_ on i-the general
publicity work which will be neces-

coming campaign.

Many ..me‘mbe_rs_ of the Pitt Faculty‘
are already enrolled in the Pitt

are Dr. Francis Tyson, Dr. Roswell

Young Rosenbaum was an honor
student in: his high school class, and
has maintained his excellent scholas-

Pitt Evening School. Deprived of the
opportunity of engaging in student
activities, owing to his not taking his
studies during" the day time, Alexander
has, nevertheless, made a host of Pitt
friends, and has affiliated himself with
Pitt interests, which stamp him as a

Plans have been made for the sec-
ond annual banquet of the aero club.
The first annual banquet of the club,
then known as the Collegiate Veter-
ans of the Air Service, was held June
9,_1919, in the University Club. at
which time it was’ voted that the ban-
quet be made an annual affair. The
second banquet will, in all probability,
beheldon the evening of June 4,1920,
in the French Room of the Schenley
Hotel, and will. he followed by a
dance. Both. the banquet and the
dance will be exclusive. Those who

alumni, and active members of the
Aero Club. The banquet and dance
will be informal. ‘

Many new memberships have been
received by the Pitt Aero Club. Among
these are John C. Ankeny, former
pilot, Frank R. Murdoch, C. Green-
wood, formerly an instructor in gov-
ernment service, M. A. Nernberg,
Stanley K. Powers, G. C. Wood, Don-'
ald Walker, and E. W. Thomson, who
was with the Royal Flying Corps of
Canada.

Future membership of the Aero
Club is one of the questions that the
club is now considering. It has no».
yet been decided whether or not to
admit men "who have not been in the
air servlce,'but this may be done. The
club is trying to- secure air service
work in connection with the R. 0. T..
C._ according to the club. There are
prospects that this will be successful,
as will also the attempt to secure a
course in aeronautical engineering, in
the School of Engineering. In case
of either or both these propositions
going through all men in the courses
indicated will be eligible to member-
ship.. However, anyone desiring to
affiliate himself with the club, who
has never been in the- air service
should file application with the club
stating reasons for desiring to become‘
a member. '

Details for the banquet and dance
will be worked out in '1 the near fu-
ture by A. W. Schoﬂeld, chairman _of
the executive committee. . I

‘Three thousand eight hundred and
‘eighty-ﬁve is the -precise number of
students now studying at the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh—.- A grand total of.
5,323 men and women have been or
will have harbored at Pitt in the
course of -the year 1919-1920.

Five hundred and eighteen new Pitt.
ites came into being with the advent
of the second sefester, nearly half of
them going to the Evening School of
Economics, while 829 severed their
connections with this institution, some
passing out via the graduation route,
others transferring‘ their allegiance to
some other university, while a. few, by
the devious vicissitudes of life, drop-
ped by the wayside. ,

The Evening School of Economics
tops the list with 646 registered for
the second semester, and 9,-total ‘of
1,009 for the year. The School of Edu.
cation is making a strong bid for first
honors. with 554 enrolled at the pres-
ent time. and. a total of 664 for the
year. The College and School, of

enrollment of 485 and 483 respective-
ly, are running a nip and. tuck race
for third position in the Pitt School
League. ‘ _

standing features of the complete reg- _

lilVE ANNUAL my
in JUNE 2-3 .

The Bachelor Club has been un-
usually fortunate in securing a play
for their seventh annual production,
to be given at the Schenley '1‘l1eat:.r,
June 2 and 3.

Earl Carroll, the Pittsburgh author,
also a. Bachelor, ‘has given the club
permission to present one of his latest
plays, entitled “Private Jim's Girl.”

The Bachelor Club has attained an
enviable position among amateur
theatrical associations of Pittsburgh.
Each year, since 1913, excluding 1918,
when 90 per cent of their members
were in the service, they have success-
fully produced a play in one of Pitts-
burgh's leading theaters.

In addition to granting the Bachelor
Clruzb permission to present “Private
Jim’s Girl,” Mr. Carroll has sent Jack
Loder, general stage manager for his
productions, on to Pittsburgh from
New York, to direct the Bachelor play;

lll’HlESHMEN ARE
l’lEllliEll BY llRlIlllS

Preceding the baseball game last
Wednesday between Juniata and Pitt,
the Druids held a pledging ceremony
on the diamond. The Freshmen
pledged were Stahlman, Pollock, Hol-
leran, Hendrian, Clawson, Byers, Han.
nett. Stevenson, Rutledge and Lange.
Their initiation will take plalce next

 

States in general, is in a bad way.
People here have forgotten the beauti-
ful things of life through the lust for

‘money. Pittsburgh has turned away
‘from true and ﬁne things and gone

chasing after hideous -monsters in the
form of dollar marks, Mr. Clayter de-
clares.

Machinery which, of course, does the
work more cheaply and quickly, has
discouraged artists who attempted to
survive in competition against the iron
and steel adversaries, and they have
rapidly dropped away. Mr. Clayter
himself stuck while others turned to
the machines for aid or abandoned
their work altogether.

The so-called art colonies in this
country are mainly gaudy sideshows,
Mr. Clayter declared “A place like
Greenwich Village in New York means
one of two things, hard work or loose
1iving—-and it is nearly always loose
living,” he asserted.

The artistic spirit is not developed
in Pittsburgh, Mr. -C-layted says. She
people are not art lovers. "And -where
they are, or think they are, they im-
mediately turn to New York for their
art, while all the time better art is
right under their noses and they
won’t see it.

There is no such art colony in Pitts-
burgh as Greenwich Village, which is
just as well. M r. Clayter declared.

llllllltlillllll ANNIIUNEES
NEW ASSEMBLY PLAN
Fllll lii§ll__lERM

Compulsory attendance at the gen-

eral assemblies of this university will
be a- thing of the past, commencing
with the opening of the next fall term.
That this announcement, made by
Chancellor Samuel Black McCormick
at General "Assembly, Wednesday

Under the new plan adopted by the
school authorities and to be put in
operation next October, the present
system of regular periodic assemblies
will be replaced by one of special
assemblies held for an express pur-
pose of importance, while reliance
will be placed upon the individual
honor and responsibility of the stu-
dents to be present at such gather-
ings.

In making this announcement, the
chancellor recounted some of the
difficulties that had been experienced
by the officials in their attempt to
arrange for a satisfactory means of
bringing all the students together at
a general assembly. He admitted that
some of the speakers at this year's
exercises were anything but interest-
ing, adding that as a consequence
student interest lagged in the matter,
to the extent that‘ many would be
reading a newspaper or a book, or
dozing off, in the course of the pro-
gram. He expressed conﬁdence, how-
ever, that with the introduction of the
new plan, these evils will be cor-
rected.‘ '

In the course of his remarks, Chan-
cellorp McCormick took occasion to
thank all those who had co-operated
in making the present school year a
success—this, in spite of the numer-
ous obstacles presented by congested
conditions at Pitt, the aftermath of
the World War, and the prevailing
spirit of unrest. That it is the chosen
patriotic mission of the, college stu-
dent to help allay the existing dis-
content, was one of the high spots of
his address. What he termed “the
only sensible solution for the high
cost of living” was declared by the
Chancellor to consist of the following
program: 1. To increase production;
2. To practice thrift in what we have.

A call for all Pitt students to par-
ticipate in some form of athletics, and
an appeal for active support of the
drive for funds for Karcher, the Pitt
Canton College representative, were
sounded by Chancellor McCormick.

Dr. Herbert Moore, general director
‘of Pitt Y. M. C. A. activities. urged
the Pitt student body to lend their co-
operation toward the Canton College
drive, by the purchase of ﬁfty-cent
shares. He read a report of the
amounts raised thus far, showing that
while one or two of the schools had
responded with an oversubscription of
their quota, most of the others were
still trailing far short of their allot-
ment.

A plea for student athletes of some
ability to try out for the pole-vault
and high jump events, and to till the
vacancy caused by the injury to
Blaine Curry, was made by J. Earl
“Red” Wlegel, who was given a warm
“hand” by the audience. zseveral se-
lections were played by the orchestra.

 

The University of Kansas, which
has had in the past one of the most
successful examples of student gov-
ernment. have recently voted to have
‘W0 Eommihg bodies hereafter, in-

year.

as the two houses of 9; legislature.
