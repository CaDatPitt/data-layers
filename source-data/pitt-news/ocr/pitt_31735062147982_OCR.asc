First Year Men to Attend Outing
At Camp Kon-O-Kwee This Weeli

Chairman Shaw Offers

Wlell Designed Program
To Orient New Students

With a final “all aboard” and the
lusty strains of “Hail to Pitt” re-
sounding down the line, the Fresh-
man Camp cavalcade will move off
from the Cathedral at 2 o’clock Fri-
day to begin the big drive to Camp
Kon—O-Kwee for the ninth annual
Freshman Camp, Harold Viehman,
camp director and assistant secretary
of the YMCA announces.

Expect Large Group

For the first time in the history of
the camp, advance registration has
been so heavy that a capacity enroll-
ment is anticipated, according to
Robert Shaw, C41, co-manager at the
camp. Registration will be conclud-
ed at the first floor desk today, al-

though freshmen registering tomor-3

row may apply at the YMCA office,
801 Cathedral until Friday morning.

Because of the heavy enrollment
Viehman asks each freshman who
plans to attend camp to be sure that

his application has been checked and ‘

accommodations arranged.

“We’d like to take more boys
along, but a limit has to be set,” he
said.

A departure from the usual con-
ception of “camp,” Freshman camp
offers a full and well-balanced pro-
gram designed to orient the freshman
to college life and acquaint him with
the customs, traditions, activities, and
people at the University.

Schedule of Events ‘

Following mobilization by schools
on all fronts, Shaw, Henry DeRoch-
er, E40, and Al Holbrook, E41, will
start their forces in a campaign of
open competition on the athletic
ﬁeld Saturday morning. Campﬁres,
stunt programs, and movies; will
highlight Friday and Saturday eve-
ning activities. Campers
have several opportunities to confer

with faculty and upperclass council-“

ors regarding their respective schools,
athletics, activities, and fraternities.
A full religious program emb “ac-
ing all faiths has been planned by
the camp staff for Sunday morning
at 9:15 o’clock. Following dinner and
meetings with the deans of the sev-
eral undergraduate schools, Fresh-
man Camp will disband at 2 o’clock
Sunday afternoon.

Perring Sets Date

Issue of Magazine

VVith a detailed explanation of the
much-used “Pitt” hand shake and
featuring Fanny the Panther’s ad-
vice to Freshmen the ﬁrst issue of
the Panther, monthly student maga-
zine, is scheduled to come off the
presses next Wednesday, according to
Mary Lou Perring, C40, editor.

Because of the numerous meetings
held at this time of the year and the
approach of rush season, Miss Per-
ring believes that the never-before
published data concerning the hand-
shake should be particularly helpful
to new students.

Supplementing these features is an
interview with the pilot of the sea-
plane which anchors on the Ohio
River.

Highlighting the issue art work is

Room during registration week.

signer of the cover, drew this unusual

its own department this school year,
director by Robert S. Warwick, Ed39,
Edward Williams, assistant dean of
men and head of the placement bu-
reau, reveals.

“Jobs as countermen, housemen,
grocery clerks, drug clerks, chaff-
eurs, drivers, and mill workers are

found part time positions as waiters,

The exact whereabouts of two Uni-

tives of Dr. Walter A. Lunden, assist-

Dr. and Mrs. Lunden sailed on
August 15 aboard the S. S. Europa of-

nothing is known of their position.

Planning to study social institu-
tions in Heidelberg, Germany; Paris,

other important cities in Europe, Dr.
Lunden received a leave of absence

Introduction to Opportunity
At the University

So you have come to the University!

"Witliout a doubt you have your own ideas of whatyou want or
hope to get out of the years you will -be here. For two days now you
have been attending events scheduled ,p.a_rticnl.a1'ly for }’Ql1..}..;}'0ll. haV,e
been hearing new Words like “orientation” and Wondering just what
that has to dowith your majoring in chemistry or Englisli, with your
being a teacher or an engineer, or even with your gett.ing into all the
activities you havebéeiili"ear‘in"g"'so ‘much about. E

Phones: University exchange. 3.vlAy-

You can

Those -things are important and they will come later.
get mere facts out of encyclopedias if that is all you want. If you

just want a diploma, you can secure it by attending cla sses every day.
You didn’t have to come to the University to be popular in activities;
you can ﬁnd the same thing at home among your friends and in civic
groups.
In this first week you may begin to understand that tliere 
something else the University, as a university, is trying to give you.
That is a chance to know yourself, to know what your possibilities are,
and to realize that you are not always the only one who is right.
‘Webster calls it perspective. You may have heard it expressed this
week as a way of living. \Vhatever it is called, it is here at the Uni-
versity. - ,..._._«‘.,.--_.. i
.. You have a. chance to ﬁnd just what you are looking for. If you
don’t look far, you can ’t expect to find much, and we still cling to
grades, quality points, and diplomas _to confuse y_ou_as to the real
meaning of education. If you care to, you can, as our Chancellor
suggests, ﬁnd “wisdom here and faith—-in steel and stone, in char-
acter and thought—beauty, adventure, an'd'n1oments of high victory.”

A Week-End Invitation
To Freshman Camp

Two hundred freshma.n men will spend this weekend at Camp
Kon-o-Kwee. in the hills north of Pittsburgh, near Zelienople. There
theywill receive a more informal introduction to l7nive1-sity life than
they’could get from this week’s program of orientation..

At the camp they will hear about the lfniversity from upperclass-
men, who have already experienced the feeling of entering an institu-
tion whose ways must necessarily be vastly different from any high
school or prep school. They will be told something about the Univer-
sity by faculty members who have watched many freshman classes
enter, confused by the whirl of registration Week.

Upperclassmen at Freshman Camp will be the leaders of every
major activity on campus. They will be eager to share their experi-
ences with the new "men, so that terms like the YMCA and Student-
Faculty Association may come to mean more than names of org'aniza-
tions Which have some vague inﬂuence on liniversitv life.

Most signiﬁcant point about. the University ‘s Freshman Camp is
that the new men themselves will be the center of attraction. They
will learn about work at the University from the uppcrcl.assmen who
have been successful in adjusting themselves to college life.

Best‘ of all for the new men at the l,:'niversity, Freshman Camp
has an informal atmosphere which cannot be duplicated by the best
lecturer in a class room. Ever since Al Barr, activities leader of a
few years ago, went swimming in.Connoquennessing Creek and
emerged from the water to be dubbed “Spanky,’x’ Freshman Camp
has been the time when the wearers of the green buttoiis were able
to meet the University “big shots” man-to-man‘. , ‘ V I I

Instead of being introduced to the University and its activities
with the aid of paddles and black neckties, freshman men can ﬁnd out
about their school in the easiest’ and best wa.y_——hea.ring the experi-
ences of other fellow-students who have already-been through the
mill. This is an illustration of the fact that at the l'niversity, the
freshman isn’t hazed; instead, he is helped. 0

If camp director Al Holbrook’s prayers forigood weather are
answered, and the boys don ’t take the wrong road from Zelienoplc,
two hundred members of the class of 43 will return from Kou-o-.l\'Wee
Sunday afternoon knowing much more about» their llniversity and
their place in it.

Headaches Loom for Pitt
Grid Team on All Fronts

As Opponents Improve

Fordham, Tech, Washington Offer
Stiffest Tests for Panther Eleven

All this talk about eastern front and western front is old stuff

to the Panther strategy board . .
trouble on all fronts this year.

. Pitt"s football forces will have

The football soothsayers have been preaching the gospel of Tech

; a.nd Fordham football prowess. The eastern title, ’tis freely rumored,
will fall into the coffers of the Rams or the Tartans.

Pitt’s schedule,

a football coach’s nightmare, includes¢

both these eastern Goliaths.

Fordham will be sharpening the ax
of revenge for the Panthers who last
year knocked off the Rams, 24-13.
When Pitt entertains Bill Kern’s ti-
tle aspiring Tartans, the revenge
motif will be with the Panthers, but
Kern’s galaxy of stars may be Panth-
er hungry.

Pitt’s opening game with Washing-
ton State Huskies will be another
vendetta affair. Jimmy Phelan’s
Huskies still carry memories of the
1937 21-0 Rose Bowl defeat and cher-
ish fond hopes of wrecking the Panth-
ers. Pitt will travel over 3,000 miles
for this love-fest.

Then out West a Nebraska team is
preparing for the ambitious program
of stepping into the Stadium and
wiping clean a slate of consecutive
Pitt wins. The Nebraskans are being
hailed as the Big Six champions and
standouts of the Mid-West sector.

Wallace Wade’s Duke team will be
the boys to beat for Southern su-
premacy. Last year they catapulted
into the Rose Bowl on the strength of
their 7-0 win over the Panthers. This
year they travel North to meet Pitt,
and their team will be on a par with
the 1938 outﬁt.

The rest of the Pitt schedule in-
cludes the “soft” spots. West Vir-
ginia, Penn State, Duquesne, and
Temple may be called soft because

they don’t ﬁgure in the ﬁght for na-
tional supremacy. That West Vir-
ginia team rides to the wars with es-
sentially the same squad that Pitt
smothered last year. Last season’s
sophomore packed team will have the
experience and the incentive to give
Pitt a long, tough afternoon. If ‘they
catch ﬁre, it’ll take a lot of football
to overcome these Mountaineers.

Penn State will face, in addition to
Pitt, Army, Cornell, Pennsylvania,
and Syracuse. Their prospects are
tersely emphasized by their belief
that the Nittany Lions anticipate the
best season in a decade.

Rejuvenated is the word for Tem-
ple whose new coach, Fred Swan, is
expected to bring in an era that will
place the Owls on the top rung in the
East. Last year’s sophomore team,
like Penn State, will carry experi-
ence into the new season. A ﬂock of
freshmen stars will augment the
squad.

Duquesne will bank on a crop of
sophomores this year, and the crop
is quite good. A lot of technical
football facts are nulliﬁed when the
Dukes meet Pitt. This year will be
no exception, and again the Panthers
will be the Big Game for the Dukes.

If we apply the vernacular to this
year’s Pitt schedule, we’re safe in
saying suicide. Pitt will play nine
games and each game will be a big
one.

To Supply Punch

In New Offensive

By Bill McElwa.in,
Sports Editor ,

\Vith scouts no longer roaming
the country on the lookout for
backs, tackles, ends, guards, and
centers, Charley Bowser, new head
grid coach, faces the 1939 season
wth a light heart‘ and a shortage
of freshman football candidates.

While there is no deﬁnite prospect
of there being no yearling team,
,Bowser refuses to take a chance.
Registrar Quick’s ﬁles have been
taken apart and the names of all
freshmen with any football experi-
ence have been extracted. The frosh
have been sent letters inviting them
% out for the drills.

Naturally, such a list of names is
at best incomplete, since a large
number of boys who are entering
Pitt were not included in the prelim-
inary lists. Consequently, Bowser
was unable to contact many of the
boys whom he would be glad to have
out. Any freshmen who have been
overlooked in the ﬁrst batch of let-
ters were overlooked unintentionally
and should not hesitate to report to

Bowser at the practice

The aim of the University is event-
ually to make the varsity teams more
a part of the student body, and by
inviting all interested men students
to come out for the teams it is hoped
that the process will be greatly
simpliﬁed. In the past, Pitt teams,
particularly the football teams, have
been almost completely separated
from the rest of the school.

But, while the freshman turnout

Bowser Calls for Panther Cubs,

Cassianoa N arlclc Twill in part determine the future of

Pitt football, Bowser is more inter-
ested in his immediate problem, that
of turning out a ﬁrst class grid ma-
chine from a squad that lost 10 senior
starters from the strong 1938 eleven.

Only Dick Cassiano, brainy senior
halfback, has returned from last
year’s ﬁrst string. Dandy Dick will
do most of the running for a team
that may become air minded in a big
wvay. Should the Panther take to
the air, Emil Narick will be the num-
ber one leather tosser. Eddie Jones,
Scranton’s sophomore ﬂash, will
"probably act as Narick’s understudy,

but the rest of the backs will be
trained to heave a football with a fair
degree of accuracy.

Ben Kish, who was the most usual
backﬁeld replacement last year, will
open the season at the quarterback
spot and should be a worthy succes-
sor to the hard-hitting John Chicker—
«neo. Fullback is the question mark
of the team, with Frank “Butch”
Goodell working out at present in
the spot vacated by the one and only
Marshall Goldberg. Ernie Bonelli
will be battling Goodell all the way
for the ﬁrst string job.

The line is fairly strong, being the
second team forward wall last year.
Dick Fullerton should continue the
tradition of great Pitt centers, while
Hal Klein and Rudy Gradisek at
guards will make the middle of the
line just about as tough as it usu-
ally is.

vlVIen Wanted . . .

Managers

Are you a freshman football play-
er? No‘? Do you like football‘? Yes?
Then, Bob Frost, BA40, wants to see
you.

Frost is varsity football manager
and he wants all freshmen interested
in following in his footsteps to begin
following right away. “It’s a lot of
fun and a ﬁne chance of winning your
varsity letter,” said Frost.

The call has already gone out for
managerial hopefuls but there’s still
plenty of time this week. All can-
didates should report to Frost at
Gate 3 of the Stadium immediately.
Frost urged candidates to report as
soon as possible, saying, “The ﬁrst
ones to get there will have the inside
track.”

Cheerleaders

Not only is the varsity football
team strictly green in makeup, the

varsity cheerleading squad also is
short on returning regulars.
At present, Clarence Shepard,

BA-40, seems to be the only veteran
and Shep is accordingly the head
cheerleader. His worry is to get out
some assistants, and Tuesday, Sep-
tember 19, at 4:30 o’clock has been
set as the day on which he will get
his ﬁrst glimpse of the new cheer-
leading prospects.

Freshmen are particularly invited
to go to Gate 3 of the Stadium at
that time. Previous experience is
not a requisite although boys who
were cheerleaders in high school
would be especially welcome.

Coaches Return to Posts

Two members of the Pitt coaching
staff are back on the job again after

lFine Arts Department Features Chinese

Paintings In Seventh Floor Galleries

Focusing ‘its attention’ on the Far
East, the ﬁne arts department» has
arranged for ‘an exhibition of Mod-
ern Chinese Painting, openingthis
week and continuing through Sep-
tember 23. It will bring to the Uni-
versity a representative group of the
landscapes and animal depictions
which dominate Chinese Art. .

‘What matters most to an Oriental
painter is the concentration of

‘thought, and prompt and vigorous re-

sponse of the hand to the directing
will. Bytradition he is compelled to
feel as whole the work to be exe-
cuted before attempting anything.

A
CL

great deal of what are called “ex-
pressionistic” lines. Jagged strokes
signify rage; broad sweeping curves,
an air of contented motion. In this
way he is comparable to the modern
painters of the West.

Included in the show will be the
works of contemporary artists and of
artists dating back to 1859. Among
the contemporary paintings is the
work of Kuan Shih .Shan entitled.
“Shrimps”; “Cicada on Willow Tree’?
by Yang Ch’ih Chuan, “Landscape”

by Hsiao Yuin, “King of Hell” by

Prince P’u Ju. Because he painted it

when seventy years of age, “The

,l'_.andscape” by Ch’ih Pal Shih holds
The Asiatic painter possesses ai '

particular interest.
