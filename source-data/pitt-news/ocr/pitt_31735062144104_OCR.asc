Seventh War Loan Begins
On Campus Next Week 7

Always leaders in other activities, Pitt students -are not to be out-

done in the Seventh War Loan Drive.

Since the national drive opens

during exam week, when Pittites will, (we hope,) be too preoccupied

to participate, the student War Finance Committee has arranged to
open the Seventh War Loan on campus Wednesday, May 2.

As in the Sixth War Loan Drive, when Pitt students cooperated
so well to raise $28,554.55, enough to buy three, “Ducks,” an effort

S gt Welsh Tells
Story of Raid
StagedbyB-293

When Sgt. Di-ck Welsh, Pitt man,
"wrote ho-me ‘~‘ I have a most ex-
citing story -to relate to all of
you,” he meant it.

According to his letter, he was
in the biggest raid ever staged by
B-29 super-fortresses when Jap
ﬁghters attacked his plane. “Most
of the instruments were out . .
Had to drop out of’ formation
. . . Our pilot . . . was certainly
on the ball. He -dove it into the
over-cast and headed out to sea.
Rarely do the Nips ‘follow you
out to-the sea. We lost them.”

The bombardier was injured too
seriously to be moved from his
position, and ‘members -of the crew
cooperated in administering ﬁrs-t
aid. “It’s surprising how nervous
and uncontrollable one will be-
come under such a situation . . .”
he wrote.

“All the way back we were
worried about getting to the field.
Our landing brakes were gone and
so on approach to the runway
(we) lost two engines . . . made
a beautiful landing. They had an
ambulance there waiting and
rushed our patient off to- the navy
hospital. We were in the air near-
ly 17 hours.”

Not everything is distasteful in
war, as the following excerpt
shows: “I n-ever saw su-ch a beau-
tiful sunset as we saw up above
those clouds sitting out there all
puffed up -and white -and looking
like something out of this world.
Even our southern friend had to
admit -that it was more beautiful
than any picturesque sky he had
ever witnessed: in old Virginny.”

Some of these days, Sgt." Welsh
will be swapping stories with you
hge at home.

Panhellenic ball will be held
Saturday in the Urban room of
the Hotel William Penn, where,

     
  

 ;,x;,iu,.‘iae aid

‘win be made in this campaign to

buy Army equipment. This time
it’s the $9,200 Personnel Carrier,
a halftrack vehicle used in all
armored divisions, which will be
our goal.

The f r a t e r n i ty competition
which produced such good results
in the last drive will be held again.
But that’s not al1—the committee
will award valuable (and intrigu-
ing!) prizes to the individuals who
purchase the most bonds before
May 16. See next week’s Pitt
News for more details about this!

An additional feature will be a
plan by which the Women’s Self

‘Government Association will sup-

port the campaign and at the same
time raise money for the twelfth
floor. Students who are interested
in the Twelfth Floor Fund will be
offered stamp books which are to
be ﬁlled and turned into the bonds
which will complete the ﬂoor when
the war is over. “

Members of the student War
Finance Committee who will be in
charge of the ground ﬂoor booth
during the three weeks of the Pitt
Seventh War Loan Drive are
Jackie Goodman, chairman; Louise
Johnson, vice-chairman; Shirley
Washington, Penn Burke, Jean
Mueller, Lee Mclnerney, Helen
Hodes, Margie Zinamon, Elaine
Brown, Louise Caldwell, Peggy
Stewart, and Deirdre Baird.

Vet Beneﬁt Planned

The perennial farce Charley’s
Aunt will be given by the Gaulois,
a city—wide French organization,
for the beneﬁt of veterans at the
Butler hospital on May 2 at the
Caravan theater, 4616 Forbes
street. Proceeds will be used to
buy rolling chairs for handicapped
servicemen at Butler.

Tickets for the beneﬁt may be
purchased from Miss Blossom
Henry at her office, 2927 CL, or
between classes, Monday, Wed-
nesday, and Friday mornings in
the French room.

Panhellenic Ball
This Saturday
At Wm. Penn

orchestra will play melodies of .
the Women’s fraternity songs as 
one of the highlights- of the eve- 5
ning, and every one will receive g
miniature Panh-ellenic song books 

for programs.

This will be the third informal 

dance Panhellenic has sponsored,
and the council has made every
effort to make it a dance that will
be remembered. I-n previous years
it -has been a strictly formal af-
fair. According to Esther From-
mer, chairman, one hundred per
cent attendance is expect-ed and
she promises, “It is going to be
the dance of the year!”

Those helping with preparation-s
are: Marica Silver-blatt, C, busi-
ness manager; Claire Dudley, C,
and the members of Junior Pan-
hellenic Council, in charge of
ti-ck-et sales; Margie Long, C, pub-
licity manager; Jeanne Gousha, C,

today to interview any students
who may be interested in applying.
Eligible engineering students are
especially wanted. Lt. Martiniwill

men whose interests are extra-
curricular as well as scholastic.

The Preparatory school course
lasts one year and will convene
this coming August. Upon com-
pletion of the course, the men
will be qualiﬁed to take the cadet
examination given in May, 1946,
for entrance into the regular Coast
Guard academy.

The course of training at the
coast Guard academy is four
years in length. Graduates re-

Now is the time, in the spring of the year, when Pitt sets
about to honor her students «for academic and social achieve-
mentcduring the past months. Now is the time when students
and faculty__gather, on Tap Day, to honor those seniors worthy
of citation after four years of honest effort and service to the
University. And now is the time when students ask themselves,
“How are these people selected?” '

In most instances, the student attends four years of classes
and graduates without knowing or understanding anything
about the nominating procedures of “student honors.” He ob-
serves only that every year the BMOCs and QP kids are singled
out by the traditions that he loves. The names added one a
year to the worn grey blocks of ODK walk, every spring a new
queen to be crowned in the old-world dignity of Coronation, each
succeeding year the naming of seniors to the Owl Hall of Fame
—all of these things are impressed indelibly upon the student’s
mind to remain forever.

And most students, either because they have not been told

_ or because they have not inquired, do not know why a thing is

thus and so. Their only recourse is to trust in the wisdom and
integrity of the groups doing the choosing. And they notice
every once in a while that the obvious person for the honor was
overlooked and somebody else named. In their eyes, this “over-
sight” constitutes a pulling-down of the ideal of the, tradition.
And they talk about it for months.

‘ It is the duty of those committees then to rule out any of
the politics that could so easily become an integral part of those
traditions that the student loves so well. They owe it to the
individual student, to the University, and to a long line of stu-
dents to come to choose whom they would honor in Pitt ’s name
with honesty and fair-play, with attention to achievement, char-
acter, and leadership rather than to personalities.

There is inscribed over the gates to the Commons room a
beautiful thought that should exemplify all that goes into mak-
ing Pittt what she is:

“Here is eternal Spring; for you the very stars of Heaven
are new.”

And when the core of Pitt activity is examined, it should
measure up in all aspects to those inspiring words over the gates.

’If we do not preserve our traditions as they were meant to be,

pure and honest in every respect, all that we love and remem-
ber Pitt for becomes worthless, a dubious-honor at best. We
cannot do less than keepour integrity.

The race question is serving many purposes in America to-
day. Screaming headlines about it are helping to sell many
cheap sensation-seeking newspapers; unscrupulous individuals
both here and abroad are using it to promote American disunity;
and gloomy would-be prophets are muttering dire predictions
about inter-racial strife after the war.

Here at Pitt, recently, a new and refreshing light was
thrown on the subject when a group of University journalism
students were taken on a tour of the plant and ofﬁces of the
Pittsburgh Courier, the country ’s leading negro newspaper.
Since the Courier has one of the most modern set-ups iii the
country, the trip ‘vas both interesting and informative.

The students were deeply impressed by the courtesy and co-
operation shown them by the various members of the Courier
staff. In every department, genial staffers not only explained
but showed interested class members just how diﬁerent pieces
of equipment were operated. Questions were answered willing-
ly and the students left the building with the feeling that the
Courier is run by a friendly group of “nice people” who really
know their jobs and have what it takes to keep their nationally
circulated newspaper “on the beam.”

This illustration throws into sharp relief one undeniable
«fact. It is that there is not and never has been any such thing
as a superior race. Every race of people has its own laudable
achievements, and every race has its shortcomings also. Herr
Schicklegruber is ﬁnding this out the hard way. Anyone who
will pause for a little sane thought on the subject can realize it
the easy way. Every race of people has something worthwhile
and vital to contribute to human development. Working side
by side, the various races can, each in t11rn, make valuable con-
tributions to world progress. Inter-racial strife means suicide
and destruction; no one can win, everyone loses.

Symbolic of what racial co—operation can mean to the fu-
ture progress of this nation are these words spoken recently by
Charles Clinton Spaulding, leading negro insurance company
business man and president of the largest negro insurance com-
pany in the world. “Let ’s remember this,” said Mr. Spaulding,
the piano to play
the Star-Spangled Banner.” ’ ' * P

The neighbors always used to
’low that Great-aunt Hetty was
the auction-goin’est woman in the
county. Every time they’d see
Aunt Hetty’s model T truck of a

Saturday afternoon, streaking it
down the lane for the highway,
the'y’d shake their heads and make
little clucking sounds with their
tongues. Uncle James, Aunt Het-
ty’s husband, felt the same way.
When Hetty would come a-panting
up the front steps with a deer-
antler hat rack or a tufted plush
footstool, Uncle James would
groan and say Aunt Hetty’s mother
must have been half pack-rat.
But that didn’t stop Hetty. She’d
just suck at her upper plate and
say nothing. And ithen Uncle
James would keep quiet, remem-
bering her threat to get rid of his
brass spittoon in favor of the ﬁrst
painted china cuspidor she saw.

Once in a while Aunt Hetty
would take me with her to a sale.
It was always more or less the
same; we’d jolt over a couple of
miles of corduroy road and park
in a barnyard beside a dozen or
so other model T’s and a row of
wagons. Aunt Hetty would pick
her way past the knots of men ex-

YWCA Open House

Given For Girls

Women students are invited to
membership party and open house
in Stephen Foster social room Fri-
day, from 3 until 5 o’clock.
Freshman women, transfers, and
non—members of the “Y” are in-
vited to meet the YW members
and officers.

Co-hostesses of the party will be
Blanche Herron, C, chairman of
the Freshman committee, and Jean
Kimpel, C, social chairman. Also
on hand to greet the guests will
be the YWCA executive commit-
tee: Jean Swope, Ed, president;
Jean Kimpel, C, vice-president;
Ileana Hutchinson, C, secretary;
Rebecca Watson, C, treasurer;
Miriam Drumm, Ed, WSGA repre-
sentative; and Ruth Miller, Ed,
ﬁnancial secretary.

President Jean Swope, has re-
quested that “all YW members
come to this general assembly to
meet new members and renew
their acquaintance with the older
ones.” It is the hope of the ex-
ecutive committee that “the newer
members will ﬁnd this a time for
becoming acquainted with many
more people, and will learn a lit-
tle of what is ahead for next
year.”

A program has been planned by
co-chairmen Herron and Kimpel
to include group singing and rec-

signs on the barn, and I would
follow her to the house, with its
picket fence hung with patchwork
quilts in tasteful color combina-
tions of pea-greenand puce. Then
she’d poke around among the stuff
displayed on tables in the yard,
deciding what to bid on.

Then the crowd would assemble
in front of the auction table and
the auctioneer’d begin to limber
up his voice on the odds and ends
—-mixed lots of china and crockery
that went for a quarter a bushel.
Aunt Hetty would rock, fan herself
with a newspaper, and look bored.
Keeping a perfect poker face, she’d
jerk her head back and a little to
the right as the auctioneer raised
the bid, not bothering even to re-
peat his ﬁgure aloud. And before
I even realized she’d been bidding,
the auctioneer’s helper would be
putting a pink china sheperdess or
a nest of butter crocks into Hetty’s
capacious lap.

Uncle James knew that if she
kept this up, pretty soon there’d
be no room in the house for even
the rosebud china cuspidor Aunt
Hetty threatened him with. He’d
be waiting at the door when the
model T chugged up, laden with
Aunt Hetty’s spoils. He’d take a
look at what she was hauling up
the front steps, spit square into
the nasturtium bed, and say, “Het,
your mother musta been half
pack-rat.” Aunt Hetty would
just suck her upper plate and say
nothing. She never did ﬁnd the
rosebud cuspidor.

Novelists Talks
On Friday

Professor Paul Engle, American
novelist and poet, will speak on
“Poetry” on Friday, April 27, at
11:30 o’clock in room 324 Cathe-
dral. Students from 4th—hour Eng-
lish literature and elective English
classes will attend the meeting.
Other University students are also
invited to hear his talk.

At 2:30 o’clock in the afternoon
of the same day Professor Engle
will meet with University English
teachers for an informal discus-
sion on questions of interest to
teachers of composition and liter-
ature.

Professor Engle attended Oxford
as a Rhodes scholar and is now a
professor of English at the Univer-
sity of Iowa. He teaches litera-
ture from the point of View not
only of a teacher of the history of
literature but of a writer as well.

In 1941 he received the prize of
$1,000 offered by the Friends of
American Writers for his poems
“West of Midnight.”

His latest work is a book of son-
nets to be published this year. A
small booklet called American
Child has already appeared.

“Sweat Out” Practices

Honest, that's what Alfred, the mouse over in Stephen Foster, heard
the other afternoon. Seems that directors, Gerry McDonough and Ed
Rose, are really putting the pressure on their sweating “Skyscraper

Caperers.”

As a matter of fact, A1 (we call him by his ﬁrst name), was

peering down from his private¢

rafter, the third one from the left,
just yesterday afternoon, and he
swore that sure as the. moon is
made of his pet brand of green
cheese, that Rose and McDonough
are carrying black snake whips
these days.

Of course, Al’s case of myopic
vision is proverbial, so could be
that it was merely tattered rem-
nants of the script that the har-
ried directors were trailing-around
after them. Did we say script?
Oh come now, let’s not be foolish
about this. Who uses a script
these days!

Everyb0dy’s getting into the act,
and the acts have been revised so
many times that Mr. Arthur has
insisted that part of the . . . . .. as
yet intagible proﬁts from the
“Capers” be applied on a new
mimeograph for the dean of men’s
ofﬁce. Seems that the Dorﬁeld-
Maloney ink supply is getting low
from over-use of Dean Biddle’s
bright blue machine.

Ah yes, the acts are getting bet-
ter all the time. Bill Church has

that wild can-can routine. Girls
take note of that; it might prove
useful for those strapless, back-
less evening affairs. Bill can be
consulted any day in the Tuck
Shop from 8:30 until ﬁve o’clock.

They’re having trouble with the
comedy trio of Safayan, Seewald
and Lupovitz, however. Time was
when the trio was a quartet, but
now it’s reduced to a DUO. Ah
these miserable draft boards.
They have absolutely no respect
for “art and drayma.”

Dick Briney is having his trou-
bles, too, for he has to keep revis-
ing the ﬁgures ih his “Treasurer’s
Report.” Every time Evelyn Kus-
serow buys ﬁve-cents worth of
gum-drops or ﬁnds that someone
else has sat on her guitar, the sur-
plus account goes down and petty
cash, carfare, and miscellanea
rises appropriately. And to think

that at one time Dick was going to‘

be a cost accountant! .

Our thanks to him for keeping
closed to the general, gawping
public this week. After all, some-
one has to keep the “Skyscraper’s”
reputation intact, and oh, that
man’s command of . . . well, let’s
call it English.

Should you have, however, a
choice tid-bit for Alfred, the
mouse, you remember, something
in the way of ham or cheese (he
refuses Mor-Beef these days), or
even cigarettes for the cast, it
might be arranged to leave the
back door open just a crack. But
otherwise, you gotta wait until
May 3. See you then.

Three years ‘before the out-
break of the Spanish-American

war, a young medical satellite left

-the Western University of Penn-
sylvania. The other day Dean
Ruth Perkins Kuehn, Dean of the
School -of Nursing, directed Dr.
E. M. Iland about the Scho-ol of
Nursing. True, Dr. Ilan-d had
stayed away for ﬁfty years and
in ﬁfty years the W.U.P.’s meta-
morphosis resulted in the Ca-
thedral of Learning and the rest
Of the -buil-dings making up the
University of Pittsburgh, but the
county medical director of Alle-
gheny County was still the same
friendly, Worthwhile chap who
had taught Materia Medica and
Therapeutics in the old days.
,War and medicine-—these two
subjects spelled the life of our
distinguished visitor. Dr. Iland
was a brigadier general in the

1917 show. Champagne .

he saw action a-t them all. Before
that was the Mexican border af-
fair and way b.ack to 1898, when
he wore the blue uniform in the
Spanish-Ameri-can war. Dr. Iland
commanded a medical regiment in
the National Guard until he was
disch.anged because of age limita-
tions. Now he appears in the
brown uniform of a commissioned
ofﬁcer of the Pennsylvania state
guard.

The county medical director
knows war ﬁrst, hand and he
knows medicine. 'Here’s what he
had to say to the nurses:

“The work done in the army
specialized training of the boys
coming to the University from
high schools throughout the coun-
try has already been a great bene-
ﬁt to the army as a whole, but

- it has rewarded and will continue

to reward the individual by

opportunities offered for greater
service to his country.

“The trained soldier is the one

Appeal to Nurses

“What we say for the men of

greater emphasis for her women.
of the Women’s Army corps.

“The role that -they are playing

 

in helping over-worked doctors
and nurses to speed the day of
recovery for our sick and wound-
ed ﬁghting men is suﬁ‘i-cient in-
centive to bring out the noblest
qualities of womanhood.

“The highest of distin-ctions is
service for others.” We can best
serve the country by joining the
Army Nurse corps now,-—
wounded man can’t w.ait one day

er nursing care at once. No sick
or wounded soldier should be
allowed to suffer needlessly for

the want of a nu-rse—-but it could
happen.”

Surveys Taken
By Journalists

What do you read when you sit
down after dinner to go over the
evening paper? A recent survey of
information gathered by students
of Miss Irvine’s journalism class
on one of the Pittsburgh news-
papers, and compiled by the Ad-
vertising Research foundation,
disclosed some deﬁnite trends of
reader interest.

For example, news of a national
character ranked highest amon-g
the ten best-read news stories of
men and women. The story of
Boake Carter’s death was of more
interest to Pittsburgh readers than
the recent trolley accident in
Homestead.

Of the columnists, Westlbr-ook
Pegler was most popular, with
Paul Mallon and Upton Close as
runners--up. The feature page was
thoroughly read by 87 per cent of
the men and 88 per cent of the
women. Picture pages held a great
deal of appeal for all readers,

The survey also indicated that
.-both men and women pay close
attention to advertisements. Three
local dep-artment store ads were
read most frequently by women,
as compared with two local de-
partment stores an-d one grocery
ad, read by men. According to
national advertisement perusals,
it would seem that more men are
shifting their shopping burdens to
their wives’ shoulders; for ads
concerning a men’s underwear
company and a well-known brand
of whiskey -were read ‘by more
women than men.

Physicals For Seniors

All senior w.omen who desire a
physical examination before grad-
uation may make arrangements
for it with Dr. Auleene Jamison at
the student health service for
women on the sixteenth ﬂoor.

In addition to the regular phys-
ical examination, the health serv-
ice offers x-ray examinations to
senior women who are interested.
Seniors ‘in the School of Education
are particularly urged to take this
examination for their applications
for college certiﬁcation.

Freshmen Fill Most of Lineup

Coach Ralph Mitterling has been
Sending his Panther nine through
daily drills in preparation for
the season lidlifter at Bucknell
University on May 5. The local
mentor, in line with other col-
leges throughout the nation, must
attempt to mold a winning com-
bination from predominantly
green material. Defensively the
Pitt combine has been faring quite
well with the right ﬁeld position
oﬁering the main headzache. Four
men have been ﬁghting for the
starting slot, but it appears. that
freshman R. Johns may get the
nod over John Pager, last year’s
starter. The batting problem has
been moving along in great stride
with Zimmovan, Kielb, Consen-
tino, and Johns hitting well. Zim-
movan and Kielb have been hit-
ting particularly hard.

On opening day Virg Fassio,
will probably be behind home-
plate. Fassio is an able handler
of moundsmen while if he im-
proves in his stickwork he may be
just what the doctor ordered. First

who reported late this spring for
practice but has been sparkling
on defense. The dependable Don

Cancer Control Beneﬁt

, Features KDKA Stars

On Friday, April 20, at Syria
Mosque, a Spring Musical Festival
featuring KDKA’s top artists was
presented by the Association of

~ Pittsburgh B u s in e s s Women’s

clubs for the beneﬁt of the Cancer
Control Fund.

Few people know the true facts
about cancer and cancer control.
It is a treacherous disease killing
165,000 persons yearly. One per-
son dies of cancer every eight min-
utes. But in spite of these dis-
couraging facts cancer is not a
hopeless disease.

The purpose of this drive dur-

ner. The outﬁeld source of the
Panther’s main batting power, is
just about set with Zimm-ovan in
left, the veteran Joe Kielb, con-
verted receiver, in center, and
very probably John in right. Mit-
terling has ﬁve pretty fair hurlers
to choose ,7 from, Lucchino, Mc-
Clure, Fred Klein, Dobies, and
Kosh. The Panther coach is un-
decided as to whom he will send
to the mound on opening day.
Few of the Blue and Gold base-
ball-ers hav-e had any extensive ex-
perience in -fast; -competition, but all
have shone in strong high school
or sandlot competition. One of the
most interesting features is the
combination of Bobby Lucchino
and Virg Fassio who have been a
pitcher—catcher combine for the
last few years. Last spring Fassio
caught while Lucchino hurled
South Hills High School to the
city title. Lucchino’s record was
eight victories against no defeats.
After graduation both men hooked
on with a strong entry in the
South Hills league and perform-
ed commendably. A few of the
Panthers are former American
Legion Federation performers;
these leagues, sponsored by the
legionnaires, have started many
young hopefuls on their way to a
major league career. Consentino
represented Avalon in such a
league as -did Matthews for his
home town, Coatesville, Pa. Also
Working out is the twin combine
of Ed and Milt Coffey, candidates
from Taylor Allderdice High.

Rifles Anxiously Await
National Final Results

With no word yet from the Na-
tional Fi-ring Match, the Pitt
Riﬂe Team is anxiously awaiting
the results of the event with cross-
ed ﬁngers. No scores have arrived
by mail regarding the competing
teams an-d their scores so no com-
parisons can be made.

With four stages to ﬁre the
Pittites found their mark with
remarkable accuracy. Out of a
possible 8,000 score the Panthers
ﬁred a score of 7,703 which is

sharp shooting in any man’s
league.
As a brief summary of the

Match, each stage consisted of two
ﬁring positions: prone-sitting;
prone-standing;

ﬁnal scores -eight men have regis-
tered -perfect scores in at least

one stage. Of the eight, three men
have three bul1s—eyes fo-r their
records. They are: Harry Herling—
er; David Benkhart; and Oliver
Keller. Close behind these three
are: Kenneth Sayers, William
Raines and Don Mateer each with
two perfect scores an-d John Hoot-
man and Ralph Lowder each with
one per-fect score.

It is interesting to note that the
variations in each man’s score
compared with that of his team-
mates ranged from a h-igh of 777
by Keller to a low of 696 with the
thirteen other scores differing by
only a few points from the next
closest man. Next to Keller the
leading ﬁre men were: Hootman,
Herlinger, Benkhart, and Sayers
with their scores -being 777, 774,
773, and 771.

We Coach ’em and Start ’em But .

By Larry Bondy

By Ed Citron, Sports Editor

Somebody says Brooklyn and you think of Flatbush Avenue,

Branch Rickey, Ebbets Field,

the Dodgers, Lippy Durocher.

Or the Bridge, the Gowanus Canal, maybe even t.he ‘tree’ that

grew there.

But here ’s a new slant on Brooklyn . .

. none of

the ﬂash and glamor, just human, simple, unlforgettable.
The countryside was ragged with bleak ridges and newly-

gashed gullies.

pook-marked the sloping ﬁelds.

Stone farmhouses were in ruins and shells had

And it was cold. American

infantry had slogged two miles through waist-deep snow and
were ﬁghting inside the vaunted Siegfried Line. .

The new guy from Brooklyn, as’

he settled himself behind the .50-
calibre machine gun and watched
the German tanks nose toward him
in the moonlight, must have
known how important it was. He
must have known, too, what would
happen if he stayed there . .

D Company had moved north in
the night, jammed in trucks that
creaked across the snow, and then
was sent in to take a clump of
houses. on a crossroads. They
chased the enemy out of the town
and in bright moonlight hurried
to dig in for the inevitable coun-
ter-attack. There were three
houses in a triangle on the far
edge of the town. On the second
floor of the house farthest from the
town the guy from Brooklyn
squinted through the sights of his
machine gun at a dirt road and
the ﬁelds that stretched out white
to the woods where the Germans

were.

The Sergeant didn’t know the
new guy’s name, but he’d seen him
around. He asked him if he was
all right and the kid said, “Yes,”
and the Sarg said did he know
about the bazooka ammunition
being all gone, and the kid said,
“Yes” again.

Three hundred yards away, out
of the black shadows of hemlocks,
loomed two German tanks, their
images clear in the glowing moon’s
light. They clanked toward the
houses while behind them crept
their infantry.

We FeelnBad 2
about Violets

The guy from Brooklyn sat up
there with the .50-calibre, and
knew that if he could stop the Nazi
infantry, the tanks wouldn’t come
in, because they needed their in-
fantry to go for the anti—ta.nl<
teams; and, he ﬁgured, they
wouldn’t know then that the anti-
tank teams had run out of bazooka
ammunition.

The noise of tanks rumbled
across the ﬁeld; the new guy must
have known about a muzzle flash
of a .50-calibre at night—how it
sputters orange and red, and
everyone for a mile around can
spot it.

Other doughs in the house heard
the kid’s gun begin to yammer,
saw the tracers streak out and
some of the German infantrymen
crumple onto the snow. The tanks
kept coming. They stopped at a
point twenty yards from the ma-
chine gun because there wasn’t
enough of their infantry to go on.
The new guy’s gun kept blazing.
The tank turrets turned toward
the house. The reﬂection of the
muzzle blast danced on the plates
of the Panzers. The ﬁrst shell
smashed the wall next to him and
he kept on ﬁring. The second
passed right through the spurting
orange and red of his gun and ex-
ploded.

He had a name all right—Pvt.
Paul Kolbert, Brooklyn. They
found it afterward, on his dog tag.
But to D Company he was just a
guy from Brooklyn.

 

  

OETS always call the violet the shrinking violet.
We feel bad about anything that shrinks--but

chieﬂy shirts.

So wc’ve spent our life
making the shirt that doesn’t
shrink, the Arrow shirt. It’s
Sanforized-labeled, which
means fabric shrinkage less
than 1%, and its Mitoga
ﬁgure ﬁt is superb. Arrow’s
collar is the world’s ﬁnest.

Interfraternity sports, will be the
annual track and swimming meet

to be held during Spring Festival.

2 at Tree’s Gym pool. The events
as liste-d to date will be:

50 yard Free Style

50.yard Back Stroke

50 yard Breast Stroke

ted to enter 2 men in each event
with the exception of the relays
which are limited to one team
of four men. The medley relay
will consist of the free style, back
stroke, breast stroke, and the side
stroke. One man is permitted to
participate in only 2 events.

The track meet is scheduled for
the Thursday following the Swim-
ming meet at 2:30 on Trees Gym
Field. The rules for the track
meet are the same as those for
the swim meet. ‘The program of

May 12--Penn State, away.
May 16——Bucknell, Stadium.
May 19 —- Penn State, Sta-

This week will bring to a close
the competition for the I-F ping
pong title. With almost all of the
games played the Pi Lams are
still holding’ the lead, but are
being closely followed by the Phi
Eps, Pi'KAs, Phi Gams, and SAES.

Up to the present no schedule
has been prepared for the I-F
softball tournament and it seems
very doubtful that any game will
be played before the beginning
of May.

Nothing more has been decided
in the I-F basketball «play-offs.
Neither the Phi Garns nor the
Phi Eps have made any arrange-
ments for their game.

Navy Wins Seventh

Navy’s baseball team defeated
Princeton, 4-0, last Saturday for
its seventh straight victory of the
season. Right-hander Ronnie Bur-
ton allowed the Tigers only two

scattered hits, as his teammates
collected ﬁve off the offerings of
the Southpaw Dutch Roehner.

The Panthers meet Navy at
Annapolis on May 9.

When one says he is a student

at the University of Pittsburgh,  

the ﬁrst thing that comes to mind

is that it’s the school with all T

classes in the same building, but
to the sports followers back in
the 20’s Pitt meant the founder

of today’s modern basketball and ‘

football clinics. Pioneers in the
clinics held at Pitt back in the
early 1920’s were Dr. H. C. Carl-
son on the court, and later Dr.
Jock Sutherland on the gridiron.

One Saturday in December of
each year was set aside for Dr.
Carlson’s basketball clinic.
Coaches from all parts of the
country would journey to the
Smoky City to discuss and learn
basketball. High school and col-
lege mentors from as far west as
Indiana, as far east as New York,
and from the south would jam the
Pavillion ﬂoor, which at the time
was the large-st court in Western
Pennsylvania. The ideas which the
coaches learned at the one-day afo
fair were carried home and put to
work to develop great basketball
players.

Through the sponsorship of the
Pitt Athletic department and the
hard work of Doctors Carlson and
Sutherland the program was
deemed a success by the high
school coaches. Nevertheless many
of these m-en never gave it one
thought to pay back this knowl-
edge they took away by sending
here a player or two who showed
signs of being All—American; in-
stead, our opponents which come
from the north, east, south and
west are now ﬁlled with the Yan-
kees, and lo and behold we have
old home week when the boys dis-
play their power in the stadium.
These high school mentors must
think it a personal triumph to
spread their proteges all over the
U.. S. and gloat over their success.
Our football and baseball teams are
getting nowhere in the sports
world, but the Panther ﬁve with
this left-over material does right
well for themselves. With a few
high school stars we could have
been in the Gardens this year and
every year.

Why do coaches send their play-
ers away? Surely it’s not to give
them a change in climate because
of lung ailments, but possibly be-

cause their local mentor may re- .

ceive slight material reimburse-
ments. One nearby coach was
offered by a Dixie college $50.00
for each man he sent them that
made ﬁrst string on the football
squad» and $25.00 for second string
material. A Mid—western basket-
ball coach is willing to take any

material from the district he can.

get while a competitive eastern
ﬂoor tutor has contacted numer-
ous coaches to round up any avail-
able matter and he will be more
than happy to cart it away. This
is how the local teachers are kill-
ing the district sports . the
same district in which they live’
and earn. .

John L. Lewis, nation labor-
leader, wonders what we are go-
ing to do for miners in our coal
mines if everyone keeps coming
in and taking our boys. So do we
