tudents spark awareness, not always action

by Joe Kennedy
Staff Writer

When students protest on the
streets of Oakland, they realize
there might not be many people
listening to them.

“I don’t think anybody realisti-
cally hopes to accomplish much,”
Amir Moghami, a graduate stu-
dent at Carnegie Mellon, said.

University administrators and

’ alumni are  government ofﬁ—

cials to work Pitt into the state’s ap-
plication for stimulus funds, but state
leaders are hesitant to reconsider
their request _ - *

Chancellor Mark Nordenberg
and Vice Chancellor of Govern-
mental Relations Paul Supowitz both
wrote to the US. Department of
Education last week  workers
there to reject the state’s application
for stimulus funds because it didn’t
include Pennsylvania’s four state—re-
lated schools: Pitt, Penn State, Tem-
ple and Lincoln universities.

Gov Ed Rendell announced al-
most two weeks ago that he would
not include the schools in the state’s
application, saying that Pennsylvania
doesn’t have complete authority over

them.

Nordenberg argued in his July 1 ,
letter to US. Secretary of Education

Arne Duncan that the American
Recovery and Reinvestment Act,

through which Rendell applied for ‘

funds, is meant to  ‘universities

larger, more volatile protests in
Iran.

Mogharni said rallies might not
incite immediate change, but as
long as the public pays attention,
the group is making progress. He
said the demonstrations are suc-
cessful “even if it’s as much as
[people] continuing to follow the
Iran news so that it doesn’t be-
come a dead story.”

Students who protested when
the Israeli-Palestinian conflict
peaked this winter had a similar
view. . . ‘
When Israel led a military at-
tack on the Palestinian-controlled
Gaza Strip in December, mem-
bers of both the Hillel Jewish
University Center and Students
for Justice in Palestine took ac-
tion in Oakland. i

Bombthreattrial delayed

by Liz Navratil
New Editor

A federal judge once again delayed set-
ting a trial date for a former Pitt student
accused of making bomb threats to two
University buildings in April 2008.

U.S. District judge Nora Barry Fis-
cher extended, for the third time, Louisa
Ewuresi Nkrumah’s deadline to file pre-
trial motions, which are now due July 31.

can be set.

The deadline was extended to give Nk—
rumah’s lawyer, Cynthia Reed Eddy, “rea-
sonable time necessary for effective prepa-
ration,” according to court documents.

Nkrumah, of Harrisburg, is charged
with using a telephone to “willfully threat-

The phrase “swine ﬂu” might have been
new to most people’s vocabularies this
spring, but new research shows that the vi-
rus has existed for almost 100 years.

Dr. Shanta Zirnmer, an assistant profes-
sor of medicine at Pitt, and Dr. Don Burke,
dean of the Graduate School of Public
Health, dug through medical and veterinary
literature and found that the ’ virus traces
back to a pig show held in Iowa in 1918,
during the Spanish ﬂu pandemic. 1

Their research, which  be published
in the July 16 issue of the New England
journal of Medicine, shows that the H1N1
virus, also known as the swine ﬂu, originated

. in birds and spread throughout the human

and pig populations simultaneously.

Zirnmer said documents describing the
death of pigs at a Cedar Rapids, Iowa, pig
show prove that swine there died of the ﬂu
at the same time the H1N1 virus infected
humans.

From 1918. to 1957, the virus evolved
differently in the pig and human popula-
tions, creating two strains with different

But these isolated incidents between pigs
and humans never caused public alarm, be-
cause the virus hadn’t yet evolved the capa-
bility to spread from human to human, she
said.

In 1957, the human strain of H1N1 dis-
appeared because of increased immunity
in the human population and competition
from a new virus, HZNZ.”

But H1N1 remained in the pig popula-
tion andgcontinued to infect humans spo-
radically, including a 1976 incident at Fort
Dix, an army base in Newjersey.

Because of the close quarters of an
army barracks environment, the pig virus
spread through humans, resulting in 230
cases and one death. The virus didn’t spread
beyond Fort Dix, but the U.S. government
implemented a mass vaccination program,
through which 40 million people were vac-
cinated. .

The program failed.

The vaccine caused some people to get
Guillane—Barre,syndrome, a disease in which
the immune system attacks the nervous sys-
tem. 32 people died. ‘

Grant money from the National Insti-
tutes of Health funded Zimmer’s review,
and the review was only a small part of the
vaccine research coordinated by Burke at the
Graduate School of Public Health.

Burke could not be reached for com-
rnent.

“He’s interested in preventing viruses
globally with vaccine ” Zimmer said. “He
wants vaccines to be transmitted all over the
world.”

Zimmer’s review will help people under-
stand the history and behavior of the H1N1
virus, but she said it doesn’t directly affect
the current development of a new vaccine.

“The big—picture message here is that
global communities need to work together
to ﬁnd out when a virus might adapt to hu-
mans,’-’ Zimmer-said.

Her historical review shows that in—.
creased surveillance of animal populations
might help public health officials predict
when a virus is likely to spread to humans.

their tuition.

Pitt, which had already ﬁozen  and
raises for faculty members, announced earlier
this summer that it would not increase tuition
at its satellite campuses. A

But Nordenberg wrote that being excluded
from the state’s application for stimulus funds

“changes everything.”

Robert Hill, Pitt’s vice chancellor of public
affairs, said in an e-mail. that it was too early to
speculate how much Pitt tuition would increase
because the University is waiting for the state
legislature to ﬁnalize Pitt’s budget

He said the University has not heard from
the U.S. Department of Education about the
letter and e—mails Nordenberg and Supowitz
sent them. '

Representatives from the U.S. Department
of Education did not return phone calls seek-
ing comment i ,

bers of Pitt’s Governmental Relations office

Supowitz and his colleagues asked these
people to write to their state senators and rep-
resentatives  them to “do everything they

stimulus funds. .

Hill said the University has heard from
more than 40 people who wanted to reach out
to their legislators. .

But several state officials said they haven’t

heard from many Pitt alumni, students or fac-
ulty members.

Pinar Ramsey, a receptionist in Senate Mi-
noiity Leader Robert Me1low’s office, said she
didn’t think the senator had “received anything
from Pitt in the mail for a while,” and a worker
in state Rep. jaret Gibbons’ Ellwood City office
said the representative had received maybe 20
or 25 letters about the subject S

State Sen. jay Costa, D—Allegheny, received
between 10 and 20 e—mails and one or two
phone  from people requesting more fund~
ing for Pitt, according to his legislative assistant,
Jamie Glasser.

“It’s certainly substantially less than we’ve re-
ceived for other issues, particularly the arts and
public TV,” she said. “It’s not insigniﬁcant”

Glasser said she hadn’t been able to talk to
Costa about whether the e—mails and phone
calls were inﬂuencing his opinion.

But the governor isn’t reconsidering rewrit-
ing the state’s stimulus application because it
would take months to do so, one of his spokes-
men, Barry Ciccocioppo, said.

Hillel members held public education
sessions on the conﬂict and sponsored a
series of speakers who explained Israel’s
stance on the event. ‘

Members of Students for justice in
Palestine helped organize a “March of the
Dead,” in which attendees silently walked
around Oakland to remember Palestinians
who died during the conflict.

Aaron Weil, Hille1’s executive director,
said he hoped drawing attention to the
separate ideologies will motivate the two
groups to start a discussion about ways to
ﬁnd a peaceful resolution to the conﬂict.

“If you can have conversations among
students, perhaps you’ll have a genera-
tion that won’t be shooting [in the Middle
East],” \X/eil said. “It all starts with dia~
logue.”

But Students for Justice in Palestine
President Jonas Moffat said there is much
to be done before the groups can formu-

late a solution.

“There was talk about having an open
debate with -SJP and Hillel,” Moffat said.
“I have not heard any more of the de-
bate since, but we are definitely opento a
healthy debate.”

Mike Epitropoulos, a history professor

V at Pitt, said these public demonstrations are

a natural part of the democratic process.

“Protests, civil‘ disobedience, direct ac-
tion and dissent are necessary elements in
real democracy,” he said, adding that pro-
tests have yielded “tangible results” dur-
ing American struggles for labor, civil and
welfare rights, but these exhibitions are just

one of many possible tools of change.

Melissa Minnich, communications di-
rector at the Thomas Merton‘ Center,
agreed.

She said her organization, which formed
in 1972 to protest the Vietnam War, views
protesting as more of a “means to an end”
than a solution in itself. She said she be-
lieves public education is one of the more
important parts of the process that mem-
bers use to protest local and world hunger,
the exploitation of workers, militarism and
racial discrimination. ,

The Thomas Merton ‘Center holds pub-
lic forums, panel discussions and teach-ins
to inform the community about issues it
protests. The center also runs a monthly
newspaper that discusses activist issues
and advertises upcoming eventselike the

National Anti—\X/ar Conference, which it
organized.

Still, some are set on protesting.

The Pittsburgh Organizing Group, a
self—described anarchist group that has pro-
tested events such as the war in Iraq, could
not be reached for comment, but said on
its Web site that it plans to stand toe—to—toe
with the 4,000 Pittsburgh police officers
who will be on duty during the G—20 Sum?
mit Downtown this September.

The group said its goal is to represent
“a. global vision based on war-making, so-
cial and economic injustice and corporate
greed.”

Epitropoulos said the manner in which
city’s residents respond to opposition
groups like the Pittsburgh Organizing
Group will say a lot about the Steel City.

“Will we respond with a respect for our
great American freedom to disagree and
protest, or will we react with clubs, tear gas
and unreasonable tactical restrictions by
riot police? I’m betting on the latter,” he
said.

Students oin letter Writing
campaign to increase Pitt funding

by Joe Kennedy
Staﬁ’ W/rite/*

Pitt students concerned about Gov. Ed
Rendell’s decision to cut Pitt’s funding will
ﬂood the offices of state legislators with
letters of concern.

Rendell recently proposed cutting Pitt’s
budget by $20 million. He also proposed
cutting the budgets of Penn State, Temple
and Lincoln universities — Pennsylvania’s
three other state-related schools.

Students armed with stationery, the
addresses of state senators and represen-
tatives and a set of talking points wrote
about the cut’s potential effects during a
letter—writing campaign in the Kurtzman
Room yesterday evening.

Students at the event voiced their opin-
ions about the drop in state funding, which
will likely raise tuition significantly for the
next academic year.

Pitt student Shenay Jeffrey said the fi-
nancial stability that Pitt offers is impor-
tant to her.

where money is stiff,” the Guyanese stu-

lated enough to get the funding we need,”
Mueller said.

Dean of Students Kathy Humphrey or-
ganized the event to teach students about
the importance of contacting government
officials to voice their opinions and to in-
form them about how the proposed cuts
would affect them.

Humphrey collaborated with Renny
Clark, vice chancellor of community initia-
tives and chief of staff for the chancellor.
Humphrey sent invitations to members of
Pathﬁnders, Residence Life and Student
Government Board.

Clark said he thought the event would
be effective because a large number of
students participated in November’s presi-
dential election.

“W/riting a letter is a form of voting,”
Clark said. “[It’s] a way of saying, ‘I don’t
think this is fair.”’

SGB member Nila Devanath said she
hopes the letters will put political pressure
on their recipients. She said she wanted to
send the message that “these letters won’t
stop until you stop cutting funding.”

For 10 years, Pittsburghers
have had just one choice when it
comes to cable service: Comcast.
Now, Comcast’s 10-year contract
is set to expire at the end of this
year. No, Comcast isn’t going
anywhere, but the company bet-
ter be ready for some competi-
tion.

A deal was announced be-
tween the city of Pittsburgh and
Verizon on Monday to launch the
cable provider’s FiOS TV service
in the area. If city council and
the city’s Cable Advisory Board
approve the deal, it shouldn’t be
long until certain areas in Pitts-
burgh can use Verizon.

Mayor Luke Ravenstahl said
he wanted to bring competition
to the Pittsburgh cable industry,
according to the Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette.

Considering that Comcast
has faced zero rivalry for about
a decade, it’s ﬁnally time for some
healthy competition.

It’s a long—standing truth of
the business world: Competi-
tion benefits the consumer most.
First, competition between the
two companies will keep prices
reduced. Verizon has yet to estab-
lish a rate for its cable services,
but it projects people living in
the suburbs will pay $47.99 per
month for 250 standard deﬁni-
tion channels and local HD chan-
t nels.

Once Verizon ﬁnalizes its
prices, Comcast will have to
match its rates, which could mean
a reduction in the current prices.
 In addition to price comparisons,
 both companies must strive to of-
 fer superior customer service and
 to keep their products attractive.

EDITORIAL

   Verizon will bring more

competition, lower prices

Verizon plans to first offer 1:
FiOS to the Downtown, North 
Side and southern neighbor— 
hoods. These places are nearer 
to suburbs that already offer Ve— 

rizon services.

Unfortunately, it could be 
three to six years until Oakland 
residents can opt for Verizon’s 
services. Adjacent neighbor— 
hoods, like Shadyside and Squir- 
rel Hill, will also likely not get 

Verizon for some time.

Given their characteristic cash— l

strapped standing, local college
students will have a propensity
to go with the cheaper option.

Thousands of Pitt students 

move off campus each year to
live in Oakland or surrounding
areas. -

Once Verizon comes to town, 
students will have more options, 
and the competition will yield 

better prices for all.

Yet, three to six years is a con— 
siderable amount of time from a 
technological standpoint. Today, 

uity.

HD TVs and channels gain ubiq- 

But no matter what the future 

holds for TV technology, com— 
petition will keep advances more 

monetarily feasible.

As the prices decrease, the 
city’s revenue will increase. By 
agreeing to let Verizon expand, 
the city of Pittsburgh will pick 
up 5 percent of its gross revenue 
—— the same rate the city already 

receives from Comcast.

Compared to other revenue 

generators —— remember the
drink tax? — this measure won’t

be unpopular or controversial. 5

And for Verizon, the rate seems 

an appropriate reimbursement.

Only quitters don't resign? You betcha!

  

by Molly Green
Colummldt

Sarah Palin began her resignation
speech from Alaskan govemorship
by saying, “Nothing’s more important
to me than our beloved Alaska” This
statement — and many others in her
convoluted and often contradictive rant
of superlatives and laments —— was a
manicured slapinthe face to the citizens
of Alaska

I‘ should preface this by saying, there
were a few portions of Palin’s speech
that were coherent For example, she
made it very clear that:

21) She really, really, really loves Alas-
kal

b) The mainstream mediais evil—-
EVIL—and nevergives her any credit
for  (‘ ‘But you don’t hear much
of the good stuff in the press anymore,
do you?” she bemoaned).

c) She can throw out folksy adages
and sports metaphors with the best of
them.

What was unclear, however, was
why, exactly, she decided to resign.

Though Palin spewed out a number
of reasons for ending her tenure, albeit
in a clumsy and  manner —
like a McDonald’s worker  out

 
 

Happy Meals —— I can tell you this: She
was  about herself, not Alaska,
when she made the decision.

Her reasoning that she cost the
state thousands of hours and $2 rnil—
lion  15 ethics complaints is
valid, I suppose. If I were an Alaskan,
I  wouldn’t re—elect her. But as
Palin said herself, the charges have been
dismissed —- “We’ve won”

So why abandon the state now after
the damage is already done? Why not,
instead, seek to compensate that lost
time and money by working harder to
serve the state?

Then she goes on to say that, some-
how, by resigningsheis choosing a path
of productivity.

According to Palin, “It may be
tempting and more comfortable to just
keep your head down, plod along and
appease those who demand: ‘Sit down
and shut up,’ but that’s the worthless,
easy path; that’s a quittefs way out”

WhatI—and I’m sure many others
—— fail to understand is how continuing
in her duties as governor is the quittefs
way out and how  is the “pro—
ductive and frui ” route

Palin offers the insincere excuse that

C it’s because she is a lame—duck gover-

nor All lame—duck governors “hit the
road, draw the paycheck and ‘milk it,”’
asif,wereshetorernaininofﬁce,the

poor thingwould be absolutely forced

,-VOA tilsua

ngtlas

to spend the majority of her time in
the lower 48 states and to ftivolously
spend money on  like, oh, say
clothing.

But she’s already done that, hasn’t
she? (You betcha!)

What’s more, if Palin was able to
accomplish so much — as she insisted,
while  a selfcongratulatory list
of triumphs on everything from eth-
ics reforrn to breaking ground on a
new prison —- while at the same time
 for the vice presidency,
then surely she could contribute equal
progress, if not more, as a lame—duck
governor

But according to Palin, she is done
with “politics as usual” (lest we forget,
she’s a maverick‘), so she could hardly
comply with the logical course of ac-
tion. I must say I agree with this asser-
tion, when you figure that “politics as
usual” entails, well, doing one’s job (un-
less your name is Gov Mark Sanford,
of course).

No. I think it’s quite clear that there
was probably a very good reason for
Palin’s resignation. But that reason was
for her own beneﬁt, not the state’s ——
though Alaska is undoubtedly better
off without her

My guess is it’s a combination of
money — Palin would make a great
deal more money speeches, writ-
ing books or  her own show

No, that would be “politics as usual,” to know exactly why she resigned, and

tell them the truth.

Elizabeth Taylor got it right:

Layton, page 10

Jackson over the past few years and then
make easy money by not only publicizing
his death, but perpetuating the notion that
they loved him all along.

Heartfelt coverage on his death, Times
magazine, but wasn’t your writer Josh
Tyrangiel calling him the “King of Pop and
Schlock” and “unbearable” in September
2001?

Jackson lived his life as an eccentric,
showy and grandiose public personality,
but that doesn’t make a ﬂashy ceremony
an appropriate complement to a somber
funeral.

When ticket scalpers are earning more
than $20,000 from a free lottery registration
system, where does the sincerity of the event
go?

The argument that the memorial
celebrated the ideals for which Jackson
strived when he was alive is shallow —— it’s
really hard to see the most basic and positive
themes of Jackson’s life behind the ﬂashing
lights, oversaturation of celebrity inﬂuence
and horrible hypocrisy that the aftermath of
his death illuminated within the media.

A fellow observer of the memorial

  

    

broadcast made an interesting comment
in that funerals are not so much for the
deceased as they are for the family and
friends.

If this is true, then I hope the family got
what it wanted out of such a garish tribute
to Jackson’s life and that the millions who
apparently consider him a friend —. many
of whom shunned and ridiculed him mere
months ago — feel like the curtain can
ﬁnally, peacefully close on Jackson’s life.

Many say that memorials for death should
really be celebrations of an individual's life,

but in the case of Jackson, his death isthe

only thing being celebrated, not only in
Tuesday’s memorial, but also by every other
outlet turning aproﬁt on the tragedy.
Elizabeth Taylor, one.of Michael’s best
friends, had it correct when she publicly
refused to attend the memorial, saying

- through Twitter that how she feels is between

her and Jackson alone and that it isn’t “a
public event.” She rightfully turned down
the offer to speak, because she “cannot be
part of the public whoopla.”

If only the rest of the world had followed

Men's Basketball 4:

Dixon, Gibbs win first five of tournament

by Jay Huerbin
Sparta E3itor

Competing on an international
level has not slowed down Pitt bas-
ketball coach Jamie Dixon.

As coach of Team USA at the
2009 FIBA Under—1 9 World Cham-
pionship, Dixon has gone 5-0 in the
tournament and secured a No. 1
seed in the quarterﬁnals.

Joining Dixon from Pitt is soph-
omore guard Ashton Gibbs, who is
averaging more than 20 minutes and
10 points per game.

After going 3-0 in preliminary

round play, the United States de- .
feated Greece and Puerto Rico —

in the second round. Despite the
outcome of its ﬁnal second round

game against Lithuania tonight,
Team USA will become the top-
seeded team when Championship
play begins on Friday in Auckland,
New Zealand.

United States 106, Iran 55

The tournament could not have
started better for Dixon and Team
USA — they dominated their open-
ing game of the tournament July
2. The United States pounded Iran
106-55 in a game that saw seven of
Team USA’s 12 players reach double-
digits in points scored.

playing time with the Panthers this
season because Levance Fields grad-
uated, played 20 minutes off the

East games announced

by Adam Littman
Aadzlttant Sparta, Eaitor

While it’s too early to start mak-
ing travel plans for those hoping to
follow around the Pitt basketball
team this year, at least now they
know where they’re going to have
to travel.

Last week, the Big East an-
nounced the sites of the confer-
ence games for all men’s basketball
teams. Each team plays 18 Big East
games, split up with nine at home
and nine on the road. Every school
also plays each of the other 15 Big
East teams at least once and plays
three opponents twice.

The Panthers’ home schedule
is highlighted by games against pe-
rennial powerhouses Georgetown
and Louisville. Pitt also plays rival
West Virginia and gets a rematch
with Villanova, which knocked the
Panthers out of last year’s NCAA
Tournament with a last-second
shot by Scottie Reynolds in the
Elite 8. Also coming to the ‘Pe-
tersen Events Center next year are
DePaul, Providence, Rutgers, St.

Johns and Seton Hall.

When venturing away from
Pittsburgh, the Panthers have a little
tougher schedule, as they play Con-
necticut, Marquette, Notre Dame,
Syracuse and West Virginia. They
also travel to Cincinnati, St. Johns,
Seton Hall and South Florida.

While the road schedule is
tougher than the home, the Pan-
thers get a break with their repeat
opponents. Other than West Vir-
ginia, which is expected to compete

‘ for the Big East title, neither St.

Johns nor Seton Hall have finished
more than .500 in conference play

since 2005-06, when Seton Hall ‘

when 9-7. The last time St. Johns
ﬁnished with more wins than losses
in the Big East was 2001-02, when
it went 9-6. .

Although the dates of those
games won’t be announced until
closer to the start of the season,
the Panthers already know a few
days they will have games.

On Dec. 8, Pitt will travel to
Madison Square Garden in New
York to play Indiana in the Jimmy

four assists, two steals and two rebounds.

For Dixon, the ﬁrst game was just what
he expected.

“One thing we did pretty well was shoot
the ball, and we made some extra passes, made
good decisions,” Dixon said. “We need to cut
down on some turnovers, but I think it was
a good start.” ‘

Despite an apparent blowout  in Team

needed to shoot the ball well and we didn’t.”

Fortunately for Dixon, his team responded
to the 32.1 percent shooting performance by
playing a strong game defensively —- com-
ing down with 39 rebounds a.nd forcing 17

-ikr radar, as she “kind of fell into volleyball”
because of her athletic ability.

It was during Ambler’s junior year at
Northwest—Shoa1s Community College that
her interest in volleyball turned into passion
under the tutelage of Tina Seals.

"’ “She knew how to develop athletes both
physically and mentally,” Ambler said.

Ambler went on to play two seasons for
the Jacksonville State University Gamecocks
after transferring from Northwest—Shoals. She
carved her name in the record books as the

all—time single—season leader for blocks per

Most recently, Ambler served as assistant

While there the Lady Tigers won two Ohio

Ambler worked as a recruiting coordinator
and volleyball operations director.

to communicate stood out to Rens. As the

new assistant coach, her responsibilities will
include recruitment efforts and personal player
development.

While Ambler’s experiences are varied, her
expectations for the Pitt volleyball team are
one—sided.

“My expectations for the team is to win,”
she said. “Winning is a mentality and I will use
my experiences to teach these girls what it takes
to be mentally tough to take the next step —
Big East Championships then competing for
a national title.

Panthers to
play in two
early season
tournaments

Schedule, page 15

V Classic, an annual four—team tournament
used to raise money for cancer research.

The Panthers are also competing in an-
other early season tournament when they
go to Kansas City, M0,, to play in the 2009
O’Reilly Auto Parts CBE Classic on Nov. 23-
24. Tlzie other three teams in the tournament
are Texas, Wichita State and Iowa.

Pitt’s schedule will be ﬁnalized sometime
in early September.

the first to build an underground parking
garage for automobiles. Trolleys allowed
easy access for fans to come in from all
points of the city. Many fans also climbed
Monument Hill, a nearby spot to watch the
games from a birds—eye view.

Another reason people ﬂocked to
Oakland for Pirates games was because
Forbes Field is considered the ﬁrst modern
ballpark. The new features included ramps,
elevators, box seats, public telephones,
special sod ﬁeld and ﬁre—proof seats. Forbes
Field was also the ﬁrst stadium with padded
outﬁeld walls and a ﬁreworks night.

If 1909 doesn’t seem that long ago just
yet, Forbes Field also filled up because the
Pirates were actually a. top-notch team.
When the park opened in 1909 the Pirates
were a powerhouse club that went on to
win the World Series in its ﬁrst year in the
new stadium. The Pirates won two more
World Series’ while playing at Forbes Field,
in 1925 and 1960.

The Chicago Cubs, the defending World
Series champions, beat the Pirates 3-2 in
Forbes Fields’ ﬁrst game. But don’t be
angry at the Cubs for ruining the opening
festivities. They still haven’t won the World
Series since 1908.
