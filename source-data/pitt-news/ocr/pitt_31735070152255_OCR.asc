loti can regenerate body parts if injured,
inanimate objects may soon be able to
do the same.

A recent study suggests that phones
and tables may eventually be able to
repair their own cracked screens and
broken legs.

Pitt engineers have developed com-
putational models that demonstrate how
a gel could allow materials to regrow
andself—heal. Published in the American
Chemical Society journal Nano Letters on
Nov. 19, senior author Anna Balazs and
three co—authors discussed the “elusive
goal.” The team also included a chem-
istry professor from Carnegie Mellon
University, Krzysztof Matyjaszewski,
who worked on the computational model
along with postdoctoral associate Xin
Yong.

“This is one of the holy grails of ma-
terials science,” Balazs said in a press
release. ,

Currently, some materials are able to
repair themselves locally by ﬁlling cuts
or scratches.

SGB leaders discuss structural changes

Danielle Fox
Stcﬁ’ Writer

The head of Pitt’s Student Government
Board said Pitt’s Board is unusual com-
pared to other universities.

He added that this may not be a good
thing.

The Board’s president, Gordon

Louderback, hosted an open forum last
night in Dining Room B of the William
Pitt Union. The event was attended
by about 20 current and future Board
members, SGB committee members and
other students. During the meeting,
Louderback invited current SGB mem-
bers and other students to critique the
structure of Pitt’s student government.

Louderback also said the Board de-
cided two weeks ago to begin research-
ing other student government organi-
zations. He said the Board members
want to implement a new system by the
spring of 2014. Louderback described
the structures of large universities’

Professors awarded Fulbright grants for international research

Jonathan Arac is immersing himself in
a place most other professors dare not
tread: an‘ undergraduate classroom. ‘

Arac, a professor of English, is taking
first-year Italian to prepare for daily
life in Italy, where he will start teach-
ing in March. He compared attending
the course to visiting a foreign culture.

“Being in a class with Pitt under-
graduates who are my fellow students,
though not the ones I’m teaching, is of
course a cultural dislocation, also, and
it’s a great one,” Arac said.

Arac is one of four Pitt faculty mem-
bers who have won grants to travel,
teach and research abroad through
the Fulbright U.S. Scholar Program this
year. The program, which is funded by
the U.S. Department of State, pays for
academics and professionals in ﬁelds
that include the humanities, science,
technology, engineering and math dis-
ciplines to study, research and teach
outside the United States. The grants
include the costs of living abroad, trans-
portation to and from the country to
which the Fulbright scholar will travel
and health benefits, according to the
program’s website. In some countries,

But “there are virtually no examples
of materials that can regenerate them-
selves,” according to the researchers.

The possibility of materials able to
fully regenerate on their own holds an
‘important implication: The lifespan of
synthetic products could be indeﬁnite.

Balazs said in a press release that the
research could improve sustainability of
materials. Objects wouldn’t have to be

books and other expenses.

Along with Arac, Susan Andrade, an
associate professor of English litera-

4 ture, was awarded a Fulbright grant to -

teach in Karnataka, India.

Pitt faculty members also received
grants to research information and
health sciences abroad. A

Valerian Kagan, a professor of en-
vironmental and occupational health,

received a Fulbright Visiting Research

Chair grant to research environmental
studies in Ontario, Canada.

Peter Brusilovsky, the chair of Pitt’s
information.,science__ program, was

to choose the right country if one wants
to doresearch.

“Some countries [where] the sun is
warm might be very attractive for sab-
batical, but it might not add very much
value,” Brusilovsky said.

Brusilovsky has already completed
his first trip to Finland, during which

The researchers’ model was based on
the biological processes found in am-
phibians, many of which can regenerate
body parts.4‘The materials the research-
ers have proposed would need to have
three components: a sensor that detects
damage and initiates a self-repairing re-
action, a method to continue growth and
a signal to stop the ongoing process.
The third step could be considered
the most important —- otherwise one

he met and worked with other research-
ers. ‘He plans to return again in April to
strengthen relations between Pitt and
what he considers to be one of the lead-
ing countries in technology education.

But some professors will head for
warmer climates.‘

Andrade plans to leave for India in V

January and remain immersed in the
culture until the end of the spring se-
mester. , ' A
She will research realism in modern
African and Indian literature, and she

, said that there is no better way to get
a feel for a culture than to dive into it. ’

“These is nothing like being there,
especially living there, to know some-
thing deeply,” she said.

Kagan said in an email he was not
available for an interview because he is
currently teaching in Canada. Except for
a brief visit to Pittsburgh in December,

' Kagan plans to remain there until the

end of the" school year.

Kagan said in a statement released by
Pitt that he is working with biochemical
researchers at McMaster University,
which is located in Hamilton, Ontario.
He and the other researchers are try-
ing to develop “substances that would
assist the human body in mitigating the
effects of harmful levels of radiation.”

grow, much like Alice in Wonderland, a
fairytale beanstalk or a cancer cell.

The researchers used nanorods, or ,.

rods approximately one-thousandth of
the width of a sheet of paper, placed in
a_ gel surrounded by another solution.
When the gel is cut, the rods will sense
a change in the‘ surface of the material,
and realize that the system has changed.
The rods then spread out, expanding
into the surrounding solution. The solu-
tion and rods interact with each other,
causing the surface to repair itself. The

Andrade, Kagan and Brusilovsky
agreed that exposure to foreign culture
is essential for a well—rounded educa-
tion. A .

‘ it “I”--think the greatest value is just to
see the bigger picture when you’re out-
side [one’s own country],,” Brusilovsky
said.

Andrade studied in France between
her undergraduate and graduate stud-
ies. She said the experience “did much

to enrich my thinking and my own sense

of self.” ‘ . .

She added that being a student in a
foreign country improved her perspec-
tive on American culture.

Arac is a proponent of foreign-
language acquisition. He said the Uni-
versity of Naples, where he will teach
comparative literature, shares the same
philosophy.

There, Arac said, students are re-
quired to learn a second Western lan-
guage and to study an Eastern language,
such as Arabic, Hindi or Mandarin Chi-
nese, to increase their cultural’ aware-
ness. I
”The capacity to‘ discover who you
are in another language and culture is
a very great enrichment of the kind of
self-understanding that university life,
in general, is meant to give you,” he said.

ticles within the outer layer have all re-
acted. '

But if additional cuts or damage oc-
curs, more reactive particles would have
to be added to the external solution to
replace those that already been used for
repair.

Yong added that they nanorods were
a “perfect vehicle” for modeling the re-
action. , ’

“The most beautiful, yet challenging,
part was designing the nanorods to serve
multiple roles,” Yong said in a statement.

SGB

student government organizations

that differ from Pitt’s Board. Loud— p

erback said Pitt SGB will continue to
host monthly meetings to get feedback
about changing the structure of SGB.

Louderback said the idea of chang-
ing the Board’s structure is something
that comes up during every term. He
said the Board is interested in pursuing
a different structure because of factors
such as the low participation in this
year’s SGB election and the fluctuating
rules that govern the election.

“We have had so many election rules
changes in past terms. So, maybe this
could be an answer to move towards
a more solidified elections system,”
Louderback said.

Although this would not affect the
current Board’s term, Louderback said
the Board members want to offer their
opinions and experiences to the next
Board.

“It’s something that if we never
brought up, who knows if the next
Board would look into making -- a
change,” Louderback said.

Louderback presented a proposed
timeline to implement a new structure.

The next Board would continue to
research and choose two to three struc-
tures that combined elements of other
schools’ student governments to con-
sider during the spring of 2014. By the
fall term of that year, the Board would
have a final structure chosen and would
prepare a referendum about the new
structure for the student body to vote
on in the 2014 election. The 2014 elec-
tion would be conducted under SGB’s
present structure.

By the spring of 2015, the Board
would edit and approve new bylaws
and decide upon logistical changes,
such as where SGB’s office space would
be located. The first election conducted
under the new structure would take
place in the fall of 2015 and include
projects addressing ﬁnal details for its
implementation.

Under Louderback’s timeline, the
new structure would be fully imple-
mented by the spring of 2016.

*Louder’ba'ckM also presented infor-

n_1_atio'n aboutstudent government-

structures at the University of Vir-
ginia, Virginia Tech and University of
California-San Diego, all of which differ
from the structure of Pitt’s SGB.
Board member Thomas Jabro al-
ready has a plan in mind for SGB’s new
structure. UnderJabro’s proposal, there
would be separate executive and alloca-
tions boards.Jabro proposed that there
would be a president, vice president, 18
Board members and nine committees
on the executive board. '
Jabro said that adding more mem-
bers would make SGB less of an “in-
siders’ group” and constitute a better
representation of the student body.
Jabro said the vice president would
be the runner-up inthe presidential
race. '
Jabro also said he wants to imple-
ment an allocations board that would
consist of a chairman, vice chairman
and 20 committee members elected by

. the student body.

“If you look at the average SGB week,

a lot ofpublic meeting and planning ‘
sessions are spent doing allocations _

requests,” Jabro said. “There are a lot

of things that we, as a Board, can do

more to reach out to students.”
Graeme Meyer, a newly elected

Board member, expressed concern‘

about students voting for roughly 40
SGB positions.

Robert Beecher, Government Rela-
tions Committee chair, said this num-
ber is not uncommon for other student
governments. '

Brandon Benjamin, a newly elected
Board member who will take ofﬁce in
January, suggested expanding SGB com-
mittees and working on “small fixes”
instead of pursuing a new structure.

“I’m not opposed to big changes,”
Benjamin said. “I just kind of wanted to
point out  these big structural chang-
es aren’t necessarily the end goal.” I

The Bureaucratic States of America:
    A nation covered with red tape

Matt Barnes
For The Pitt News

Injune 2013, Harvard econom-
ic and international historian
Niall Ferguson wrote a column
in the Wall Street Journal titled
“The Regulated States of Amer-
ica.” The piece eloquently, yet
frankly, described the growing
gargantuan American bureau-
cracy. The piece used Alexis de
Tocqueville’s classic study of
American society, “Democracy
in America,” as a basis.

De Tocqueville’s magnum
opus, published in two volumes
in 1835 and 1840, observed the
unique qualities that made the
United States an exceptional
place. Government interven-
tion was minimal-and personal
and private associations were
prevalent. De Tocqueville rec-
ognized that Americans relied
less on their government and
more on their own efforts.
Throughoutthe years, Ameri-
cans cultivated their emerging
nation through personal indus-
triousness and responsibility.

De Tocqueville did not,
however, ignore prospective

- problems that the young coun-

try could ultimately face. He
warned of the dangers of an
over-intrusive government,
writing that it “rarely forces
one to act, but it constantly
opposes itself to one’s acting;
it does not destroy, it prevents
things from being born; it does
not tyrannize, it hinders.”
The reality is that Ameri-
cans’ freedoms are being re-
stricted, most notably econom-
ically. This shift from personal

responsibility to reliance on
government, which is often
forced upon citizens, is the
result of a nation suffocating
from an abundance of red tape
wrapped.around it.

The enormous federal bu-

-reaucracy best characterizes
our growing federal govern-
ment’s intrusiveness, ineffi-
ciency and ineffectiveness.

The 2012 Federal Register,
the official directory of regula-
tion, totals a massive 78,961
pages and is growing. Consider
endeavoring to gain a thorough
understanding of modern man-
dated government regulations.
The reality is that you couldn’t
—— or at least not in time to stay
current. Presently, roughly
4,062 regulations are in the
process of being implemented.

Because of this, businesses,
especially small businesses,
cannot keep up. Per employ-
ee, the costs of regulation on
small businesses are 36 percent
higher than they are for their
largerucounterparts.

Due to overbearing intru-
siveness and superﬂuous regu-
lation by the federal govern-
ment, prosperity is hindered,
not promoted. In fact, the last
time regulation saw a rollback
was under President Ronald
Reagan in the 1980s. During
his administration, the amount
of pages in the Federal Register
dropped by 31 percent. What
happened during those years‘?
Did the stock market plummet?
Did the economy take a turn
for the worse? Did Americans
suffer from the reduction of
the grand federal bureaucracy?

Not quite. In fact, the GDP
rose by 30 percent.

Since 1993, the federal gov-
ernment has reverted back to
its role as nanny. Since then,
81,883 new rules have been en-
acted. Perhaps more appalling
is another statistical reality.

Congress is the facet of
government that should most
inﬂuence public policy. After
all, it is supposed to most rep-
resent the people. Despite this,
new rules issued by the 63 fed-
eral government departments,
agencies and commissions have
outnumbered laws passed by
Congress 223-to-1.

If this many rules and reg-
ulations are involuntarily be-
ing thrown onto our nation’s
citizens, why is there so little
resistance? Shouldn’t we want
a government that encourages
freedom, rather than one that
restricts it? Well, one of the
greatest political philosophers
in American history accurately
predicted today’s current phe-
nomenon.

- James Madison once said,
“I believe there are more in-
stances of the abridgment of
the freedom of the people by
gradual and silent encroach-
ments of those in power than
by violent and sudden usurpa-
tions.”

As Americans, we havebeen
fortunate. We have been spared
from demagogic dictators and
vindictive monarchs. On Inau-
guration Day, we are blessed to
witness a\peaceful transition
of power between two often-

What are most harmful to Americans
are contemporary insidious abridg-
ments of freedom.

I am not alone in believing this.

dispute this notion.

Even if people think these regula-
tions do not affect them, they do. Ac-
cording to the Journal of Economic
Growth, the increase of federal regu-
lations over the past six decades has cut
U.S. economic growth by an average of
two percentagepoints per year. Conse-

How could Thanksgiving possibly getany

I had always deemed it impossible for a
holiday that revolves around family, food
and football to get any betterthan it already

Thanksukkah: A day when two traditions gcollide

an excuse for youngJewish children to get

presents, as well — Hanukkah is also the T

celebration of a miracle. The tiny amount
of oil that was left in the Holy Temple in
Jerusalem for the Maccabees was only sup-
posed to last one night. However, the oil
lasted a miraculous eight nights, and the
Maccabees were able to survive and con-
tinue their rebellion against the Seleucid
Empire. For the eight nights the oil lasted,
Jews celebrate by lighting one candle per
night on the menorah. .

holiday that deals with selfirgflecﬁon, Ha-

Shaky Shdhes
Mausoleum

Grade: B+

Sounds like: A soundtrack

of the life of a doomsday

prepper

With a mixture of campy rock ‘n’ roll
elements, seductive vocals and playful
use of modern paranoia, Shaky Shrines
has put together an album that goes
best with a quadruple~locked door and
boarded—up windows.

Mausoleum, the debut LP by the
Pittsburgh—based five—piece band, does
a deft job of blending Dick Dale—style

V guitar solos with punchy rhythm guitar

parts. The use of female backup sing-
ers adds an interesting retro element,
seamlessly working its way into the

backbone of the album’s choruses.

But the highlight of Mausoleum —
and the reason why Shaky Shrines is a
memorable ensemble —— is their use of
lyrical content that satirizes the some-
times outlandish fears that plague soci-
ety. What’s really scary, though, is how
relatable they are.

Beginning with the song “Strangers’
Eyes” — a tune that puts listeners in the
clutches of a voyeuristic nightmare -
the tone of the album is set, with the
chorus of: “Keep your eyes open, keep
your mouth shut.” From there on, the al—
bum twists and turns through fears with
the help of organ sounds and simple
pop song structures.

The album’s highlights include the
final track, “Someone’s in the Base-
ment,” a darkly scathing song that plays
on the fears ofsuburban homeowners.
“He wants money for drugs and junk,”
and “he’ll sell your things at the local
pawn shop,” goes one of the verses,
sung behind an atmospheric guitar riff,

making it easily the most experimental
track on the record.

But Mausoleum isn’t only about
fears surrounding other people’s im-
moral intentions. “Can’t Quit” dis-
cusses the seemingly impossible task
of trying to quit drinking when your
entire social life revolves around it,
and “Nothin’ to Do” goes over how once
you reach the age of 22, things start to
become mundane.

The tracks on Mausoleum continu-
ously have an ominous feel that help
deﬁne Shaky Shrines’ sound among a

relatively simple set-up of guitar, bass,
drums and keyboards.

The campy element is played up a
lot, with haunted-hayride-like laughs
in “Someone’s in the Basement” and
Black-Sabbath-like guitar riffs in the
song “Nothing to Do.”

As far as local debuts go, “Mauso-
leum” stands out as remarkably smart,
well-crafted and innovative. Instead
of reverting to cliched choruses that
derive their sound from stashed-away
punk-rooted chord progressions, Shaky

‘Shrines is consistent and good at what

they are trying to accomplish, which
is both retro and reﬁned. The band is
adept at taking the eerie feel of a Blue
Oyster Cult song and making it sound
authentic and actually cool. I

Pitt notches Wire-to-Wire win.

in Brooklyn over Texas Tech

Nate Barnes
Sports Editor

Shortly after Pitt’s game against Tex-

as Tech began at the Barclays Center

Monday evening, it was just about over.
The Panthers jumped to a 26-point lead
early and had no trouble in a 23-point
wire-to-wire victory over the Red Raid-
3.1’ 3, 76—53.

With its victory Monday, Pitt (5-0)
moves on to the ﬁnal game of the Pro-
gressive Legends Classic, in which the
Panthers will play either Stanford or
Houston tonight.

 » Lamar Patterson led the early charge,
scoring 14 points in the first half. When
Patterson canned a 3-pointer with 3:39
remaining in the first half, his indi-
vidual point total outpaced the 13 points
scored by the entire Texas Tech squad in
about the first 16 minutes of the game.

We  Patterson finished with a career
night, scoring 23 points to top his
previous career high of 22. Patterson
shot 8-of-13 from the field, 4-of-7 from
3-point range and added four steals,

three assists and two rebounds.

Next to Patterson, shooting guard
Cameron Wright added 12 points on
4—of—6 shooting as the only other Pan-
ther to reach double figures. James
Robinson added nine points, and Chris
Jones scored eight off the bench.

The first half ended with Pitt holding
a 41-18 lead after the Panthers shot 12-
for—26 from the field for a 46.2 percent
clip. Defensively, the Panthers allowed
the Red Raiders to convertjust 6 of24
attempts for a meager 25 percent rate.

Factoring in Pitt’s early success de-
fending the basket were the 12 turnovers
the Panthers forced at Texas Tech’s
expense. As a result, Texas Tech head
coach Tubby Smith’s unit was never
able to establish much of an offensive
rhythm. j“

Texas Tech (4-2) found its offensive
game early in the second half, shooting
5—of-6 to start the half. But Pitt kept
pace, and the Panthers’ lead ballooned
to as much as 28 points afterjones con-

Panthers face Hurricanes in season's final game

Nate Barnes
Sports Editor

Pitt football enters the week of Thanks-
giving fresh off its 17-16 victory at
Syracuse Saturday that qualified the
Panthers for their fifth consecutive

bowl-eligible season. This week, Pitt”

has a short week of preparation before
the Miami Hurricanes visit Heinz Field
Friday afternoon.

Pitt (6-5, 3-4 ACC) is bowl-eligible
for the second time in head coach Paul
Chryst’s second year, and the team is
currently projected by many to receive
an at-large bid to the Little Caesars Pizza

Bowl Dec. 26 in Detroit, Mich. With one
game remaining, the Panthers havethe
opportunity to earn a ﬁnal conference
win against Miami (8-3, 4-3 ACC) and
snap up one of the conference’s lower
tier automatic bids. =

“It’s kind of exciting,” Chryst said.
“I think the kids are looking forward to
turning around and playing this Friday.”

A win Friday would also give the Pan-
thers their highest win total since the
2010 season, Dave Wannstedt’s ﬁnal
year as head coach, when Pitt capped
an 8-5 season with a win in the BBVA
Compass Bowl. Pitt finished 6-7 in the
past two seasons.

The Panthers have some injury is-
sues to contend with this week in the
form of redshirt freshman tackle Adam
Bisnowaty. Senior guard Cory King is

- also expected to stay on the mend for

another week.

“He won’t go this week, we have him
out for the season,” Chryst said. “He
fought through a lot, we didn’t feel like
once he got back on the field it was all
better.”

At the left tackle slot, seniorjuantez
Hollins is expected to start Friday. Next
to guard Ryan Schlieper, the left side
of Pitt’s offensive line now consists of
players who were not starters at the

beginning of the season.

“Juantez is going to come up, and
he stepped up,” Schlieper said. “He’s
experienced, he knows exactly what he’s
doing, he knows the plays, so that’s good
to have.”

Chryst added that tight end Scott
Orndoff and defensive end Ejuan Price
remain inactive, while receiver Devin
Street and linebacker Shane Gordon will
be evaluated this week. Neither Street
nor Gordon ﬁnished Saturday’s game.

Pitt needs all available weapons at its
disposal this week against a fast Miami

team. The Hurricanes are missing their
leading rusher, Duke Johnson, who was

lost for the year. because of a broken

ankle. 1

“Obviously, he was a really good play-_

er, a really good back,” Chryst said. “But
also as you play different teams you don’t
know exactly how they change.”

At the time of his injury, Johnson had
racked up nearly 1,000 yards in just
eight games, and he averaged 6.3 yards
per carry with six touchdowns. Despite
the loss of their most explosive offensive

asset, Chryst still respects the capabili- 1
ties of the talented Hurricanes ‘offense. _

“I think they still present all the same
problems to us now,” Chryst said. “In the

‘ run game, certainly in the throw game,

they’re explosive.”
With ]ohnson’s absence in the back-
ﬁeld, Dallas Crawford has stepped into

the role of lead back. Crawford has car— ‘

ried 45 times for 207 yards, and three
touchdowns in his three starts since
Johnson went down.

Next to Crawford, quarterback Ste-
phen Morris leads Miami’s offense with
2,572 passing yards and 18 touchdowns
against 12 interceptions. His primary
target is senior wideout Allen Hurns,
who has hauled in 51 passes for 965 yards
and six scores this year.

“Receiversblow the top off the cover-
age. Their tight ends can run,” Chryst
said. “Defensively, they ﬂy around.”

For the Panthers to be able to keep
pace with a speedy Miami team, Chryst
stressed the importance of preparation
in this short week to cut down on the
team’s thinking time while on the ﬁeld.
In turn, the more quickly the Panthers
act, "the better they can keep up with a
faster team. V

“If you hesitate, that’s where I think,

the speed can get you,” Chryst said.-

Friday’s game is also the ﬁnal one at
Heinz Field for players such as Street and
defensive tackle Aaron Donald.

“There’s no -pressure, we just know
what we gotta do,” Donald said. “We ain’t
comfortable, we still want to win. We still
want to win this game Friday.” H

After the game, McConnell-Serio said

she will use a lineup that is dictated by the

flow of the game, and one that she believes
gives Pitt the best chance to win.

“A win is a win. We pulled the game out
by grinding it out, by changing the pace
